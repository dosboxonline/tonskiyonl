[tense music playing]

00:08.008 --> 00:09.842
- [man] <i>State your name.
- Peter Sutherland.</i>

00:09.843 --> 00:12.845
[man] <i>Did you know that these individuals
were foreign agents?</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:14.347
<i>No, not then.</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:16.724
- Hey, were you followed?
- No.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.059
But the mission is on alert
after what happened last night.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.520
They're saying you broke
one of the guard's collarbones.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.230
I found this on the banister.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.649
She works with me.
I'll make sure she gets it.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.318
- The photos Rose took, you have them?
- I didn't bring them.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.070
We have to know what's in those documents.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.781
If those documents
are as important as you say,

00:32.782 --> 00:34.575
get my family out of Iran.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.784
[both grunting]

00:35.785 --> 00:36.745
[in Farsi] Stay back.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.329
[Azita in Farsi] Let's go!

00:41.416 --> 00:42.542
[officers grunting]

00:44.878 --> 00:45.712
[Azita] Farhad.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.047
[in Farsi] I'm going back...

00:48.048 --> 00:49.758
[in Farsi] Just put the gun down, Farhad.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.596
[Azita shrieking]

00:55.597 --> 00:56.765
Farhad!

00:57.474 --> 00:59.808
[sobbing] You killed my son!

00:59.809 --> 01:01.185
- [phone ringing]
- Yeah.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.352
[Sami] <i>Things went bad.</i>

01:02.353 --> 01:04.438
<i>The... the brother took a shot at me.</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:06.023
<i>I... I had to shoot him.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:07.399
[sighing] <i>He's dead.</i>

01:07.400 --> 01:09.151
[somber music playing]

01:09.152 --> 01:10.153
Understood.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.155
Are they safe?

01:13.364 --> 01:14.324
[receiver clicking]

01:15.283 --> 01:17.326
Yeah. Yeah, they're safe.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.412

[music fades]

01:44.604 --> 01:45.522
[man] Catherine.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.774
Catherine.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.401
- Cat.
- [Catherine inhaling]

01:51.486 --> 01:52.737
[Catherine groaning]

01:53.947 --> 01:55.657
- Anything?
- [man] Nothing.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.661
Maybe he slipped out while we were doing
a shift change and ditched the car?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.746
Anton Sidorov is an SVR agent

02:02.747 --> 02:05.207
with a decade
of countersurveillance experience.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.961
He wants you to second-guess yourself.
It's a game of patience.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.420
And you're losing, kid.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.673
[tense music playing]

02:14.134 --> 02:15.468
[Catherine groaning]

02:16.469 --> 02:17.302
[man muttering]

02:17.303 --> 02:20.597
If you're praying to the big man,
he's clearly not listening.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.892
You wanna try your hand? Be my guest.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.395

Noah, wake up. It's Anton.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.206
[Noah exhaling]

02:45.999 --> 02:47.542
- [car starts]
- [Catherine] He's leaving.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.296
[Noah] Come on. Let's go.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.432
[drill whirring]

03:09.189 --> 03:10.231
[screw clicking]

03:23.161 --> 03:23.994
Noah?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.955
<i>There's two unmade beds here.
I don't think Anton's alone.</i>

[knocking on door]

04:37.735 --> 04:38.695
[door opening]

04:39.237 --> 04:41.531
- You asked to see me, sir.
- I did. Come on in.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.491
His name's Yuri Abramov.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.243
He's confessing? To what?

04:46.244 --> 04:49.621
His partner, your original target,
Anton's whereabouts.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.081
The Pentagon breach.

04:51.082 --> 04:55.252
Their man inside, how often they met.
Payment scheme, all of it.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.628
How'd we break him in two days?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.714
Well, on top of having
a shithead for a son,

04:58.715 --> 05:01.550
Yuri's poor mom
suffers from a rare blood cancer.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.302
We promised to get her treatment

05:03.303 --> 05:06.013
and get the prison doc
to fit him with a glass eye.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.016
I just thought you should know
that Noah's loss...

05:09.017 --> 05:10.767
[breathing deeply]

05:10.768 --> 05:12.020
...wasn't for nothin'.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.106
I'd like you to start building a file
on Yuri's FBI mole.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.524
I... I don't think I should.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.192
This wasn't your fault, Catherine.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.112
[Catherine] I think that you should
give it to one of your other agents.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.281
One that didn't survive off of sheer luck.

05:24.282 --> 05:28.995
Ninety-nine out of 100 times,
that behemoth squashes you like a roach.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.748
Yet you picked the one scenario
where you survive,

05:32.749 --> 05:35.500
bring him in, and we break the case open.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.878
That wasn't luck.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.714
I've already lost one good agent.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.215
I'd rather not lose another.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.302
[dramatic music playing]

05:52.894 --> 05:54.354
Yuri's FBI mole?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.608
What's his name?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.361
[Jamie] Peter Sutherland.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.367
[opening theme music playing]

06:11.412 --> 06:12.329
[Noor] <i>So, what next?</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:13.372
Your mother and brother,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.583
they'll change planes in Istanbul
and Paris to obscure the trail.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.335
They'll arrive in New York tomorrow night.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.088
So, what about me?
What should I do until then?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.508
Once you give us the photos, we'll arrange
for you to move to a safe house

06:24.509 --> 06:26.426
outside the Iranian mission's
restricted zone.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.845
So I just walk away now?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.639
Unless that's a problem?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.518
No, it is just happening so fast.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.060
It's almost over.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.479
[cell phone vibrating]

06:37.688 --> 06:38.730
Is everything okay?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.982
It's work.
Probably Haleh asking where I am.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.652
I was supposed to be back
from the doctor 20 minutes ago.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.571
- I'm going to call back.
- Yeah.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.072
Thank you.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.532
[door opening]

06:48.533 --> 06:50.326
[tense music playing]

06:50.827 --> 06:51.786
[Catherine sighing]

06:54.747 --> 06:56.457
What? What's wrong?

06:57.041 --> 06:57.959
There was a problem.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.546
It's Noor's brother.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.172
- [in Farsi] Where are you?
- [Noor in Farsi] <i>Still at the doctor's.</i>

07:04.173 --> 07:05.924
She's running behind.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.801
Okay, get back now!

07:07.802 --> 07:08.844
What's wrong?

07:08.845 --> 07:12.556
[Haleh] <i>I just spent two hours
being questioned by Javad and his guards</i>

07:12.557 --> 07:15.100
<i>about why that woman at the party
gave me a cell phone.</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.352
- Javad has footage of it.
- [Noor] <i>What...</i>

07:17.353 --> 07:18.645
What did you tell him?

07:18.646 --> 07:20.856
[Haleh] <i>The truth. That it was your phone.</i>

07:20.857 --> 07:22.899
<i>He's waiting to speak to you,</i>

07:22.900 --> 07:26.027
but he thinks Bijan and I
were involved too.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.821
They're still questioning Bijan.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.073
<i>Whatever happened, whatever's going on,</i>

07:30.074 --> 07:33.160
you have to tell Javad. Please.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.786
[Noor] <i>It's just a misunderstanding.</i>

07:34.787 --> 07:37.415
- I'll fix it. I promise.
- [Haleh] <i>Good...</i>

07:43.045 --> 07:44.546
- [music fades]
- [Noor sighing]

07:44.547 --> 07:47.382
- You have to tell her the truth.
- [Peter] We don't know how she'd react.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.718
She could run off,
she could tell the mission.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.304
She could destroy the pictures,
then we'd have nothing.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.015
If only you knew what
we were up against with Foxglove.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.642
How can I when you won't tell me?

07:57.226 --> 08:00.228
It doesn't matter.
Sami will tell her when he picks her up.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.856
She'll be safer that way.
At least she'll be out of harm's way.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.566
You mean you won't be the one to tell her?

08:04.567 --> 08:08.154
Peter's right. It's the only way
to protect the investigation and Noor.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.197
- Peter.
- [knocking on door]

08:10.198 --> 08:11.365
We don't have a choice.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.242
[Rose sighing]

08:17.413 --> 08:18.706
Hey. Uh, all good?

08:20.249 --> 08:23.085
- I need to go back to the mission.
- Why? What's going on?

08:23.794 --> 08:26.296
Javad has been questioning Haleh
about the party.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.965
- He suspects she was involved.
- Noor, you cannot go back.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.220
There's a chance they've pieced together
what you've been up to.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.471
You do not wanna take that risk.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.474
I won't let her suffer because of me.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.854
Look, um,
you do what you need to do, okay?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.481
And then just shoot us a text
when you're done,

08:44.482 --> 08:47.276
and we'll come pick you up
and take you someplace safe.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.320
Is everything okay?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.031
[tense music playing]

08:53.032 --> 08:54.783
[Peter] Yeah, it's all good.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.786
The pictures. We need the pictures, Noor.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.998
- Something's going on.
- No, nothing's wrong.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.419
I... I want to talk to Rose. Alone.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.922
Yeah. Of course.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.552
[door opening]

09:16.597 --> 09:18.599
[suspenseful music playing]

09:23.729 --> 09:25.940
What is going on?
What aren't they telling me?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.360
Please, just tell me.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.073
- It's your brother.
- What? What happened?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.702
He... he was, um... injured.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.160
How?

09:39.161 --> 09:43.290
One of the neighbors intervened when
they were leaving and it got physical.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.377
I don't know all the details,
but... [exhaling]

09:47.962 --> 09:50.840
I think he might have broken his arm.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.095
But otherwise, he's okay?

09:57.513 --> 09:58.555
Yeah.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.223
Why wouldn't they say anything?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.392
They're really desperate
for those pictures,

10:02.393 --> 10:04.853
and they weren't sure how you would react.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.106
- They should have said something.
- [Rose] I know.

10:08.065 --> 10:08.983
I'm sorry.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.111
Okay, I have to go now. But...

10:12.820 --> 10:14.070
Um...

10:14.071 --> 10:15.364
[objects rustling]

10:29.253 --> 10:30.630
[Noor] Here's the password.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.718
Thank you for being honest with me.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.392
[Rose's breath shuddering]

10:47.396 --> 10:48.481
[knocking on door]

10:49.982 --> 10:50.857
Hey.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.109
Hope it was worth it.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.778
- Where's Noor?
- She left.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.030
- Where are you going?
- Back to the apartment.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.242
- Solomon Vega's still out there.
- I can't be here. I feel sick.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.163
- Rose--
- Peter, we have work to do.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.541
[Peter exhaling]

11:08.542 --> 11:09.918
What is so urgent?

11:09.919 --> 11:11.921
People violated my residence.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.464
Americans.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.841
Seems they were looking
for the list you sold me.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.386
Sounds like your man
needs to improve his security protocols.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.139
- Who gave you the list?
- We don't give up our sources.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.934
Same as we would never give up our buyers.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.770
[Abbas] But you do trust them, yes?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.981
We do business with them, don't we?

11:34.610 --> 11:35.945
What about these two?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.824
This woman, this man?
Do they look familiar?

11:42.284 --> 11:43.202
No.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.455
I can't say they do.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.750
[indistinct chatter]

11:50.751 --> 11:52.210
[siren wailing in distance]

11:52.211 --> 11:54.338
[in Farsi] He's hiding something.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.842
[in Farsi] He's toying with us.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.429
The documents, where are they now?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.889
They are in a safe place
in my desk in my room.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.767
We should place them in my office safe.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.311
They'll be secure there.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.481
Okay, whatever you’d like.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.941
Good then.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.237
We can stop by your residence on the way.

12:18.946 --> 12:19.946
Of course.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.032
[tense music playing]

12:24.034 --> 12:25.077
[Catherine] Drive's clean.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.834
Moment of truth.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.002
[keyboard clacking]

12:34.003 --> 12:36.337
The DGSE?
What do the French have to do with this?

12:36.338 --> 12:38.424
[keyboard clacking]

12:41.010 --> 12:43.928
- What? What does it say?
- These have nothing to do with Foxglove.

12:43.929 --> 12:44.846
What do you mean?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.891
A list of Iranian dissidents
living in Europe.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.476
Names, addresses, aliases.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.020
Useful for the Iranian government
if they want revenge.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.688
It's completely irrelevant to us.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.231
No, that can't be right.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.650
You're telling me
we wasted three days working for this?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.778
That Noor's brother is dead for nothing?

12:59.779 --> 13:03.157
Okay, Night Actions
are never straightforward.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.286
It'd be unusual
if we didn't hit a dead end.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.289
Means we need to approach this
from a different angle.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.709
But there's still a common link
between Foxglove intelligence and this.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.670
Solomon Vega and the guy who called me.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.798
He seemed like he was running things.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.425
Maybe they were using Foxglove
for their own devices?

13:22.426 --> 13:24.804
He traded it to Iran in exchange for what?

13:26.055 --> 13:29.349
I mean, Warren did say that Solomon
seemed like a middleman, but for who?

13:29.350 --> 13:30.851
[tense music playing]

13:31.811 --> 13:35.522
Maybe Solomon and his boss
are foreign assets on the Iranian payroll.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.691
Right? They find the regime
a do-it-yourself chemical weapons kit

13:38.692 --> 13:40.652
and a list of potential targets.
Maybe that's it.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.323
In any case, it seems like
the only way forward is through Solomon.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.616
Now we have a new point of contact too.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.660
Whoever traded this DGSE intel.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.870
These printouts are in color,
which means that...

13:50.871 --> 13:53.331
- Machine identification code.
- Exactly.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.793
We just have to find a picture
that's close enough.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.213
[keyboard clacking]

14:00.047 --> 14:02.298
[Peter] There you go.
Date, serial number, time.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.800
- It's all right there.
- Yeah, it is.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.135
Alice taught me that.

14:05.886 --> 14:06.887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:07.763 --> 14:08.888
Guess who taught her?

14:08.889 --> 14:10.390
[suspenseful music swelling]

14:10.391 --> 14:11.349
[Peter chuckling]

14:11.350 --> 14:13.435
[music fades]

14:18.816 --> 14:20.025
[door opening]

14:23.821 --> 14:24.863
[man] Thank you, gentlemen.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.325
If you don't mind, my client and I
have legal issues to discuss with his son.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.202
[guard] Yes, of course.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.417
[door closing]

14:37.835 --> 14:39.044
[chair sliding]

14:42.172 --> 14:43.257
[clearing throat]

14:44.300 --> 14:45.968
Sloane says hello.

14:47.803 --> 14:48.971
Which one was that again?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.639
[Tomás scoffing]

14:54.518 --> 14:56.811
I've traveled a long way to be here today

14:56.812 --> 14:58.980
because I believe
there has been a miscommunication.

14:58.981 --> 14:59.899
Markus.

15:04.945 --> 15:08.156
I know he's family,
but you shouldn't send a jackhammer

15:08.157 --> 15:09.949
to do the work of a scalpel.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.994
His approach is... indelicate.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.538
[man 2] I will take indelicate
over ineffectual.

15:15.539 --> 15:19.626
What have you done besides signing checks
and drinking with old college roommates?

15:19.627 --> 15:20.544
That's not...

15:21.170 --> 15:22.296
[scoffing] I mean...

15:23.714 --> 15:25.006
Elliot was in a position to help.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.509
It's not exactly easy getting clemency
for someone convicted of war crimes.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.511
[man 2] Convicted?

15:30.137 --> 15:31.889
On whose authority?

15:32.473 --> 15:35.934
The United Nations
bends to the will of America.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.646
Funny thing when the devil condemns you
for using his own hellfire.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.317
Their hypocrisy will be exposed
in due time, I promise. But I--

15:44.151 --> 15:46.945
I cannot maneuver properly if you won't
keep your war dog in his cage.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.490
Markus knows his limits. I set them.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.241
Meaning what?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.495
Surely you are not this naive.

15:57.331 --> 16:02.127
No amount of maneuvering
would ever force them to admit the truth.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.964
The plan was never to simply expose
their hypocrisy, was it?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.757
[sinister music playing]

16:07.758 --> 16:08.842
Mm-mm.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.095
You want to make an example
on American soil.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.889
[suspenseful music playing]

16:17.059 --> 16:18.142
Why didn't you tell me?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.646
Because it is your name
on all the accounts filled with my money.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.441
You didn't think I'd release the funds
if you told me the truth?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.697
You always hated hunting
when you were a boy.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.325
You would make
these childish excuses to stay home,

16:34.326 --> 16:39.080
to stay warm, as the men
trudged off into the cold dark.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.708
[suspenseful music continues]

16:41.333 --> 16:45.670
But when we would return home hours later
with a 14-stone boar,

16:45.671 --> 16:50.259
guess who wormed his way to the front
to take a tusk as trophy?

16:50.884 --> 16:53.971
All the glory, none of the blood.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.056
It's my fault.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.059
I indulged your mother
and allowed such weakness to take hold

17:00.060 --> 17:01.437
when you were a pup.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.439
Then I let her send you to England

17:04.440 --> 17:07.776
to be educated
in all the wrong things, apparently.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.864
And now you simply lack
the instinct required

17:12.865 --> 17:14.742
of such an immense sacrifice.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.494
Is that truly what you think?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.251
No, my son, it's what I know.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.754
[suspenseful music swelling]

17:28.630 --> 17:30.214
I am not the boy you once knew.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.801
- Words are hollow things, Tomás.
- [Tomás] Fuck you.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.930
How about those? Do they feel hollow?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.808
Perhaps I'm wrong.

17:42.978 --> 17:43.937
We shall see.

17:57.993 --> 17:58.952
[car horn honking]

17:59.453 --> 18:00.703
[music fades]

18:00.704 --> 18:02.372
[indistinct chatter]

18:08.504 --> 18:11.255
[Javad in Farsi] Check the pockets,
inside the lining, all over.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.259
You find anything, tell me immediately.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.765
Noor, you're back.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.391
[Noor in Farsi] Hello.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.144
- Everything okay?
- [Noor] Yes...

18:25.145 --> 18:28.148
I was hoping to talk to you
about something...

18:32.861 --> 18:33.862
Actually,

18:34.446 --> 18:35.864
let's speak in my office.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.199
More privacy.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.745
[suspenseful music playing]

19:06.019 --> 19:07.311
How was the doctor?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.480
[Noor] Wow, took forever.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.110
American healthcare really is dreadful.

19:13.861 --> 19:17.030
But I did get some medicine, thankfully.

19:18.866 --> 19:19.825
That's good.

19:23.203 --> 19:28.082
I wanted to clarify something
from the other night at the party...

19:28.083 --> 19:30.418
The phone Haleh found was mine.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.172
Haleh told me you had questions.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.174
She had nothing to do with it.

19:36.175 --> 19:40.012
It was my mistake. I'm sorry
to have caused any alarm or confusion.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.307
May I?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.326
Noor, nobody was supposed to be upstairs.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.243
[Noor] I know.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.914
It was an emergency.
I had to find a vacant bathroom because...

20:07.497 --> 20:08.707
I had a woman's trouble.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.877
I didn’t want to disrespect the rules.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.464
So I was rushing and forgot my phone.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.717
Did you see anyone else upstairs?

20:19.718 --> 20:22.094
No, I was alone as far as I could tell...

20:22.095 --> 20:26.599
Haleh mentioned
an American woman found your phone.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.267
[Noor] I never saw her.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.271
And I'm certain Haleh
had no business with her, either.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.148
Does Abbas know about any of this?

20:34.149 --> 20:35.067
Not yet.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.609
But...

20:36.610 --> 20:37.945
I'll have to tell him.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.906
He's going to fire me...

20:45.452 --> 20:47.162
I think you're okay.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.289
He has bigger issues to deal with.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.125
Like what to tell the foreign minister

20:53.126 --> 20:59.257
when he asks why an intruder

20:59.258 --> 21:03.178
was snooping around his residence.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.221
Will he get in trouble?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.180
[Javad] Possibly.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.140
But...

21:08.016 --> 21:10.269
Abbas has weathered worse.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.353
What do you mean?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.648
Shirin, his daughter.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.232
You haven't heard?

21:16.233 --> 21:19.152
I know they're estranged,
but what happened?

21:19.653 --> 21:22.738
[Javad] She went to study abroad,

21:22.739 --> 21:24.866
fell in love with a foreigner.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.204
Never came back home to Iran.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.538
Hmm.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.166
[Javad] Then, she fell prey
to Western propaganda,

21:33.667 --> 21:36.627
made false, inflammatory comments

21:36.628 --> 21:39.046
about our country.

21:39.047 --> 21:44.093
She not only disgraced
her nation and her family,

21:44.094 --> 21:46.095
she set her father's career back.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.932
Took him almost a decade to recover.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.769
I'm...

21:53.353 --> 21:55.772
going to keep this, run some scans.

21:56.356 --> 21:59.483
Make sure it's clean.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.819
Thank you.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.323
I think I'll head back,
sleep off this cold.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.366
Let me walk you.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.784
No, that's okay, I...

22:08.785 --> 22:09.953
Please.

[train rattling]

22:43.570 --> 22:46.155
Hey, Gretchen,
I'm sorry for the late notice.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.656
I didn't know who else to call.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.534
<i>Glad you reached out.
I was wondering how you'd been.</i>

22:50.535 --> 22:51.578
<i>What's going on?</i>

22:53.413 --> 22:56.457
I know I haven't exactly been open
about everything that happened

22:56.458 --> 23:00.379
after my aunt and uncle
were killed last year, but...

23:02.255 --> 23:03.256
I wanna try.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.344
After the home invasion,

23:08.345 --> 23:11.598
there was this friend
who helped me through it.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.435
He was going through his own shit too,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.063
and I helped him through that.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.735
And for a little while,
it felt like we were a team.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.408
And then he, um... He disappeared.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.745
And we hadn't talked in a while.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.208
He got into some trouble recently,

23:39.209 --> 23:43.922
and... I thought I could help him.

23:46.091 --> 23:51.012
But he's in such a dark place right now,
and I'm worried if I stay here,

23:52.264 --> 23:55.767
I don't know, I... I might be headed back
to that dark place too.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.273
I'm starting to regret coming here.

24:03.608 --> 24:08.780
<i>It... It sounds like
you two bonded over shared trauma.</i>

24:09.906 --> 24:12.116
<i>That makes for a powerful connection,</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:15.036
<i>but not necessarily a healthy one.</i>

24:15.829 --> 24:17.497
<i>How long have you known this guy?</i>

24:18.582 --> 24:20.667
On and off for less than a year.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.128
<i>That's not that long.</i>

24:23.753 --> 24:28.467
<i>I can tell by the way you talk about him
that you care, deeply.</i>

24:29.259 --> 24:31.302
<i>But you have to ask yourself</i>

24:31.303 --> 24:34.848
<i>whether you'll still feel the same way
once the smoke clears.</i>

24:36.099 --> 24:37.851
[contemplative music playing]

24:38.351 --> 24:39.186
Yeah.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.437
I don't know.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.356
[Gretchen] <i>I know how hard it's been
for you to talk about your experience</i>

24:44.357 --> 24:46.067
<i>after the home invasion.</i>

24:46.943 --> 24:49.070
<i>This is a big step forward, Rose.</i>

A glass of Malbec, please.
Whichever one you recommend.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.548
And whatever my friend here is having.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.343
Malbec sounds lovely. Thank you.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.888
[in French] When did you first notice me?

after I left the Permanent Mission.

they send to the UN, Ms. Laurent?

[in English] I was on my way
to speak to my Belgian counterpart.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.821
I don't like to miss appointments.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.203
How can I help you, Agent Weaver?

26:21.204 --> 26:25.457
[Catherine] I recently came across
these classified DGSE files

26:25.458 --> 26:28.335
on prominent Iranian dissidents
now living in the European Union.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.420
Where'd you find them?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.297
[Catherine] In Iranian hands,
which is problematic

26:31.298 --> 26:34.008
given their recent spate
of targeted assassinations.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.177
<i>Oui</i>, that is problematic.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.389
I am more than happy to forward them
to my contacts in the DGSE.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.808
Oh, no need. I have friends over there.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.102
I can send them their way
if circumstances call for it.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.772
No, no, no.
I was wondering if you had any idea

26:48.773 --> 26:50.567
as to who leaked the intel.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.694
[Jacqueline chuckling]

26:53.695 --> 26:57.239
I hope you are not
wandering around New York

26:57.240 --> 26:59.199
tailing every French diplomat.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.285
- [both chuckling]
- [Jacqueline] I couldn't tell you.

27:01.286 --> 27:04.788
There's probably a dozen
DGSE undercover agents in town.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.207
Spooks running all over the city
during General Assembly.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.919
You're right. And because of that,
the FBI sends some poor junior agent

27:10.920 --> 27:14.256
to every library,
copy shop, co-work space,

27:14.257 --> 27:18.802
every public-facing color printer they can
find that can print out a sheet of paper.

27:18.803 --> 27:22.931
And on that sheet of paper
are these tiny yellow dots,

27:22.932 --> 27:26.518
which tell the date, time,
and printer serial number.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.647
That agent, that poor agent... [chuckles]

27:29.648 --> 27:34.109
...enters each serial number into a database
with its corresponding location.

27:34.110 --> 27:39.491
All so that when I find these dots
on classified intelligence,

27:40.283 --> 27:43.452
I can track them to a printer
in the back corner

27:43.453 --> 27:46.538
of Frank's Quick Copy on 34th and 2nd.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.416
Now, fortunately for me,
unfortunately for him,

27:49.417 --> 27:51.877
Frank was robbed a month ago.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.755
Put up hidden security cameras
throughout his store

27:54.756 --> 28:00.720
and caught a woman strolling by
two weeks ago at 3:43 p.m.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.807
UN sustainability development officer

28:04.808 --> 28:08.436
and undercover DGSE agent,
Jacqueline Laurent.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.480
You look a little flush, Jacqueline.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.566
Don't worry. Don't worry.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.362
- I'm not looking to expose you.
- What do you want then?

28:17.946 --> 28:19.029
An introduction.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.198
[tense music playing]

28:21.032 --> 28:22.826
[siren wailing in distance]

28:23.493 --> 28:25.578
Noor texted me from her burner.

28:26.579 --> 28:30.709
She's gonna try to get out tonight.
I'm on standby in case she does.

28:31.835 --> 28:35.295
Figured you and Catherine will be pulling
an all-nighter going through the intel.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.548
[Peter] Actually, uh...

28:37.841 --> 28:39.050
[Peter exhaling sharply]

28:39.592 --> 28:42.053
...the intelligence had nothing to do
with Foxglove.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.726
So lying to Noor, her brother dying,
it was all for nothing?

28:48.727 --> 28:52.020
Not for nothing, you know.
Catherine's following up on a lead.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.608
But, yeah, it wasn't the silver bullet
that we'd hoped for.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.819
I know I asked a lot of you, Rose.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.903
I'm... I'm sorry.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.905
I'm not the one you need to apologize to.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.867
I'm doing the best I can.
Tough choices are part of the job.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.828
Your job. That's the difference.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.664
You signed up
to be a night agent, I didn't.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.167
[cell phone vibrating]

29:17.130 --> 29:18.047
It's Catherine.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.426
Right. I know the drill.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.053
[phone continues vibrating]

29:26.806 --> 29:28.349
[tense music playing]

29:28.975 --> 29:30.559
Hey. Did you find Laurent?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.603
[Catherine] <i>More than that.
I got her to play ball.</i>

29:32.604 --> 29:37.024
She claims that she's been selling
state secrets to Solomon Vega for years.

29:37.025 --> 29:37.941
Years?

29:37.942 --> 29:41.236
Never knows where the intelligence goes
or how it's used, though.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.697
- Well, what's she get in return? Cash?
- [Catherine] <i>Sometimes.</i>

29:43.698 --> 29:45.449
Other times, they can do a trade.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.369
Foreign intelligence, top-secret,
case-breaking shit for the DGSE.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.662
And what about Foxglove?

29:50.663 --> 29:54.291
Honestly, she genuinely looked confused
when I mentioned the name.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.793
<i>If this has been going on for years,</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:58.879
maybe Foxglove is just a piece
to a much larger puzzle.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.547
[Catherine] <i>We'll find out soon.</i>

30:00.548 --> 30:03.509
I got her to set up a meeting
with Solomon Vega in two hours.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.302
How's that enough time
to get another agent ready?

30:05.303 --> 30:07.554
- No need. I'm going to the meet.
- You?

30:07.555 --> 30:09.598
[Catherine] <i>We don't have time
to bring someone in,</i>

30:09.599 --> 30:11.183
and I'm the only one he hasn't seen.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.269
I'll go in as a prospective seller.

30:14.270 --> 30:17.815
<i>You follow him and see if he leads us
to anyone higher up the food chain.</i>

30:17.816 --> 30:19.858
How do you know Laurent's
not trying to set a trap?

30:19.859 --> 30:22.152
I don't know,
but I'm willing to roll the dice.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.362
[Peter] <i>Send me the address.</i>

30:23.363 --> 30:25.614
I'll try to set up
what surveillance I can in the area,

30:25.615 --> 30:27.699
but I wanna be on the ground as backup.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.161
Well, we'll need someone
to watch the feeds.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.249
- You and Rose make up yet?
- [Peter] <i>She needs some space.</i>

30:34.833 --> 30:36.333
I can't keep asking her to help me.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.628
Well, it doesn't stop me from asking.

30:43.508 --> 30:47.970
[man] <i>Four more years under the same party
that gave us Ashley Redfield,</i>

30:47.971 --> 30:49.471
<i>that gave us Diane Farr</i>

30:49.472 --> 30:52.558
<i>and all the outrageous things
that came with it.</i>

30:52.559 --> 30:53.851
<i>It's untenable.</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:56.478
<i>The American people deserve to trust
in their institutions again,</i>

30:56.479 --> 30:59.398
<i>and they should be able to sleep soundly</i>

30:59.399 --> 31:02.192
<i>knowing that
there's a firm hand on the wheel.</i>

31:02.193 --> 31:04.778
[anchor] <i>In the most recent debate,
you criticized Governor Hagan</i>

31:04.779 --> 31:08.365
<i>for what you deemed
as a neo-isolationist agenda.</i>

31:08.366 --> 31:11.785
<i>In your opinion, what should the U.S.--
What role should it play abroad?</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:14.371
<i>Between my time
on the Select Committee on Intelligence</i>

31:14.372 --> 31:16.832
<i>and my role

31:19.168 --> 31:23.463
<i>You cannot lead the world

31:23.464 --> 31:26.049
<i>Now, Governor Hagan
wants to withdraw from NATO,</i>

31:26.050 --> 31:30.762
<i>stop sharing intelligence with Five Eyes,
uh, defund the United Nations.</i>

<i>Now, maybe that's how

31:33.224 --> 31:35.893
<i>from his governor's mansion

31:35.894 --> 31:36.811
[TV clicks off]

31:37.312 --> 31:39.897
Our DGSE liaison reached out.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.481
Something new to sell?

31:41.482 --> 31:42.733
Someone.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.527
She's keen to make an intro.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.489
Huh.

31:49.198 --> 31:53.453
Three days after Sutherland's
fishing expedition

31:54.037 --> 31:56.372
at the Iranian ambassador's residence.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.586
Do you believe in coincidence, Solomon?

32:02.587 --> 32:03.880
I know you don't.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.218
- Set it up, then.
- It's already done.

32:10.511 --> 32:11.387
Good man.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.182
[sinister music playing]

32:19.520 --> 32:20.395
[remote clicking]

32:20.396 --> 32:24.316
<i>I would say that the governor has a very
poor understanding of how the world works.</i>

32:24.317 --> 32:26.485
How are the preparations
for tomorrow going?

32:26.486 --> 32:27.778
[Markus] We're on schedule.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.738
[Tomás] <i>Good.
Save me a seat on the truck.</i>

32:29.739 --> 32:30.906
[Markus chuckling]

32:30.907 --> 32:31.824
Really?

32:32.450 --> 32:33.867
- Really.
- [Markus] <i>All right.</i>

32:33.868 --> 32:37.537
But these are my men.
They take orders from me.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.498
[Tomás] <i>Your men?</i>

32:39.082 --> 32:42.126
No. They serve
at the pleasure of my father,

32:42.627 --> 32:43.586
<i>as do you.</i>

32:44.087 --> 32:46.297
- You talked to him?
- [Tomás] <i>I met with him, yes.</i>

32:47.423 --> 32:48.758
I understand the plan now.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.176
And?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.761
And I approve,

32:52.845 --> 32:54.054
without reserve.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.140
<i>- I'm on my way back now.</i>
- We'll be ready by the time you land.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.559
[Tomás] <i>Make sure you are.</i>

33:01.562 --> 33:03.564
[Tomás sighing]

33:07.193 --> 33:08.152
[knocking on door]

33:15.910 --> 33:16.786
Can we talk?

33:17.495 --> 33:19.163
Peter told me where you...

33:20.915 --> 33:22.000
two were staying.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.044
Why are you here, Catherine?

33:26.045 --> 33:28.255
Let me guess.
You need my help with something?

33:28.256 --> 33:30.340
[Catherine] I have a meeting
with Solomon Vega.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.218
Peter's setting up a few cameras
around the meeting location,

33:33.219 --> 33:38.890
and I was hoping you could tap into
some additional security feeds.

33:38.891 --> 33:40.475
- Keep an eye on things.
- No.

33:40.476 --> 33:43.186
[Catherine] Honestly, I thought you'd be
a headache to have around,

33:43.187 --> 33:45.522
but you've been really valuable.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.150
I mean, you must have
some of your aunt in you.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.861
Do not talk about her.
You didn't know her.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.155
No. Jamie Hawkins

33:53.156 --> 33:58.535
would refer to Sidewinder and Gazelle
all the time when he was my case officer.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.289
Where were you last year then?
After they were killed?

34:02.165 --> 34:05.417
When Peter and I were running for
our lives, where was Night Action then?

34:05.418 --> 34:08.837
When Hawkins' body was found
out in the field, we all went dark.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.506
Me and the other case officers.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.592
We didn't know
if we were compromised from within.

34:13.593 --> 34:17.804
So we paused all investigations
to rule everybody out.

34:17.805 --> 34:18.972
It was a scary time.

34:18.973 --> 34:22.225
I didn't know if I could trust people
who were closest to me.

34:22.226 --> 34:26.022
And that's the hardest part of the job,
figuring out who has your back.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.608
And you trust me to have yours?

34:29.650 --> 34:32.570
- I thought I wasn't part of the family.
- [Catherine] I deserve that.

34:34.363 --> 34:35.782
But families grow.

34:36.365 --> 34:40.244
And me reaching out to a civilian
should tell you, of all people,

34:40.912 --> 34:42.330
how desperate I am.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.042
I'm about to walk into a situation
where everyone around me

34:47.043 --> 34:49.211
is probably looking to kill me.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.881
And I'm a little short on friends
at the moment.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.218
Right now, Peter is all I have.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.470
Peter's been enough for me in the past.
You'll be fine.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.639
Well, still, I could really use you.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.476
I do not wanna be put in a position
to hurt more people.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.853
I'm done. I can't do that again.
That's not who I am.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.689
Well, it's reductive to view this job
as right and wrong,

35:09.690 --> 35:12.360
because everything is relative.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.237
Now, what I can tell you

35:14.904 --> 35:19.574
is that a good agent knows
the consequences of their actions,

35:19.575 --> 35:22.577
and a bad agent stops caring about them.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.246
And for what it's worth,

35:24.247 --> 35:28.709
it sounded like
your aunt and uncle were great agents.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.588
And Peter?

35:34.715 --> 35:35.842
To be determined.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.553
It's still the beginning for him
in all of this.

35:39.554 --> 35:43.808
But what I can tell you
is that he is better with you by his side.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.146
[contemplative music playing]

35:49.564 --> 35:50.606
[Rose sighing]

35:52.316 --> 35:53.151
Fine.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.987
But no more keeping me in the dark.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.489
If you want my help,
I want to know everything.

35:59.490 --> 36:03.076
I figured as much,
so I spoke with Deputy Director Mosley,

36:03.077 --> 36:06.873
and he has granted emergency clearance
to read you in on Foxglove.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.748
What is it?

36:08.749 --> 36:10.667
[suspenseful music playing]

36:10.668 --> 36:12.461
- [knocking on door]
- [Noor gasping]

36:13.671 --> 36:14.755
[in Farsi] Who is it?

36:16.132 --> 36:17.425
[knocking on door]

36:27.727 --> 36:28.686
[in Farsi] Noor,

36:29.645 --> 36:31.397
I need you to come with me.

36:32.732 --> 36:33.566
Right now.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.569
What for?

36:40.740 --> 36:41.574
Please.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.995
So you know, you try to fuck me on this,

36:46.996 --> 36:50.707
I've instructed a copy of the intel
and the security footage

36:50.708 --> 36:52.876
to be sent to your superiors.

36:52.877 --> 36:53.836
Understood?

36:54.337 --> 36:55.337
You're nervous.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.588
[indistinct chatter]

36:56.589 --> 36:57.548
I'm fine.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.634
Get it out now.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.970
He might not look it, but he's cunning.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.388
He'll notice.

37:06.974 --> 37:08.350
I looked you up.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.935
Moved to France when you were 12,

37:09.936 --> 37:13.272
worked for your adoptive country
right after university.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.026
Diplomatic postings
in Tunis, Baghdad, Mosul.

37:18.027 --> 37:21.196
Seems like at one point
you may have actually loved your job.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.366
You want to know why, is that it?

37:24.158 --> 37:27.619
February 2015,
I was called back to the home office

37:27.620 --> 37:32.499
and I was told that I had served
my country admirably in the field,

37:32.500 --> 37:33.875
<i>merci,</i>

37:33.876 --> 37:37.879
but that this portion
of my career was over.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.675
Never mind that I had just helped
stop a civil war in Cameroon.

37:41.676 --> 37:48.140
The impact of my entire career
came down to one number.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.850
My age.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.187
Three years I wasted away behind a desk.

37:54.188 --> 37:57.023
And then a man approached me
with intelligence

37:57.024 --> 37:59.151
desperately needed by the DGSE.

37:59.694 --> 38:03.238
And in exchange,
I gave him some information

38:03.239 --> 38:05.949
so inconsequential, I can't even remember.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.161
And after that, the home office decided

38:09.829 --> 38:12.498
that I had left some life in me after all.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.836
It is not that I don't love
my job anymore.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.005
I love it too much.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.299
[chuckles softly]

38:22.049 --> 38:24.426
As I suspect you do too.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.512
[car horns honking]

38:32.226 --> 38:33.227
[Abbas] Mm-hmm.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.732
[in Farsi] Yes, then keep me updated.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.568
Thank you.

38:44.113 --> 38:44.947
Noor,

38:46.782 --> 38:47.616
sit, please.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.911
[tense music playing]

38:59.754 --> 39:01.339
[Abbas groaning, sighing]

39:02.631 --> 39:03.466
Sit.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.351
When's the last time
you spoke with your family?

39:14.226 --> 39:16.854
[in Farsi] A couple of days ago.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.189
Why?

39:19.190 --> 39:25.278
[Abbas] Police in Isfahan received reports
of a disturbance at your house.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.616
I don't know how to say this,
but it seems like...

39:29.950 --> 39:31.369
your mother is missing.

39:35.039 --> 39:35.915
Missing?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.209
What do you mean? What happened?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.252
Police are still investigating.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.171
[music fades]

39:44.590 --> 39:45.633
And my brother?

39:46.300 --> 39:49.178
[Abbas] The case is still evolving.

39:49.804 --> 39:55.851
But a body was found on a road
several miles from your home.

39:56.852 --> 39:57.686
A body?

40:00.481 --> 40:01.482
What do you mean?

40:02.942 --> 40:05.485
I don't understand.
Please tell me what happened.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.363
[Abbas] I'm really sorry, Noor...

40:10.324 --> 40:11.575
but I need you to

40:13.244 --> 40:15.579
identify the person in this photo.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.126
[Noor gasping]

40:26.173 --> 40:27.049
No.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.804
No, it's not possible.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.806
No, it can't be... It can't be...

40:34.807 --> 40:37.476
No, it's impossible. It's just impossible.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.647
Impossible.

40:42.648 --> 40:46.443
- Listen, we don't exactly--
- No, that's impossible, impossible.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.403
No.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.823
[somber music playing]

40:51.824 --> 40:53.200
[Noor breathing heavily]

41:08.507 --> 41:09.800
[Abbas exhaling]

41:12.887 --> 41:14.095
[Abbas sighing]

41:14.096 --> 41:16.181
[tense music playing]

41:16.182 --> 41:17.933
[siren wailing in distance]

41:19.852 --> 41:20.810
[Peter] I have a visual.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.147
Me too. Catch the door code?

41:25.483 --> 41:26.817
[Peter] Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

41:30.070 --> 41:30.988
[door closing]

41:33.782 --> 41:35.200
[Peter] I think I see the apartment.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.077
On the third floor, southwest corner,
just like Laurent said.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.746
Can't see inside, though, from here.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.206
<i>- Can you?</i>
- [Rose] No.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.957
But I only have two views of the place.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.751
<i>Got as close as I could
without tipping them off.</i>

41:44.752 --> 41:48.963
Let me know if you see anything, okay?
Movement, lights, any sign of life.

41:48.964 --> 41:51.966
The rest of the building
looks pretty dead to me.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.969
Wouldn't be surprised if they owned this
for meets like this.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.681
Takes some pretty serious cash to do that.

42:01.310 --> 42:05.147
[Jacqueline] You don't think I'd suddenly
be armed after all this time, do you?

42:05.648 --> 42:07.148
Can't always trust new friends.

42:07.149 --> 42:08.734
[kissing]

42:09.777 --> 42:11.152
- No offense.
- None taken.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.154
They're clean.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.992
- Elizabeth, nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

42:20.037 --> 42:20.912
Come with me.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.998
[suspenseful music swelling]

42:24.792 --> 42:26.167
You have company out front.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.460
[Peter] Keep an eye on 'em.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.671
I'll give it a minute.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.589
I'm gonna head west
to the building above the coffee shop.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.300
<i>Get a different angle on things.</i>

42:34.134 --> 42:36.052
Wait, they're moving
towards your building.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.845
- What are they doing?
<i>- Just patrolling.</i>

42:37.846 --> 42:40.139
Caught 'em
on the coffee shop security cam.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.268
- Heading towards 167th.
<i>- Once they're clear, I'll head down.</i>

42:43.269 --> 42:45.853
You should've seen the way
she handled herself in Baghdad.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.772
No walk in the park for a young woman.

42:47.773 --> 42:51.568
You're giving me too much credit.
Those Raytheon guys were assholes.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.486
Somebody had to put them in their place.

42:53.487 --> 42:57.115
Still, was a nice surprise
to run into her after all these years,

42:57.116 --> 42:59.784
and doing quite well for herself.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.453
- Not well enough.
- [Solomon] Is that what brings you to me?

43:02.454 --> 43:04.247
Supplemental income?

43:04.248 --> 43:06.333
Jacqueline tells me you buy information.

43:07.334 --> 43:09.252
Did she? What else did she tell you?

43:09.253 --> 43:12.589
You can smell bullshit a mile away,
and I need to keep my ass at home

43:12.590 --> 43:16.343
unless... I'm being serious.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.596
[Solomon] Well that's good advice.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.015
Let's see if we'd be a good fit.

43:22.349 --> 43:24.351
[suspenseful music swelling]

43:27.479 --> 43:29.481
Shit. Rose, I can't see anything.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.399
I gotta change position.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.526
<i>- You have an update on Solomon's team?</i>
- [Rose] Wait.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.696
- I lost one.
- Well, where are they?

43:40.159 --> 43:41.492
One of the guys doubled back.

43:41.493 --> 43:44.662
The alley of the northwest corner
of the building where you came in.

43:44.663 --> 43:46.205
Okay, I'm gonna head south.

43:46.206 --> 43:48.208
<i>See if I can get down
to a different building.</i>

43:52.713 --> 43:54.922
Peter, head east.

43:54.923 --> 43:56.841
- What?
- Just trust me. Head east.

43:56.842 --> 43:57.760
Okay.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.137
[inaudible]

44:04.558 --> 44:05.725
Come on.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.768
[cell phone vibrating]

44:06.769 --> 44:08.353
- What's going on?
<i>- Don't say anything.</i>

44:08.354 --> 44:10.606
I don't know how,
but they're listening to our comms.

44:12.232 --> 44:15.151
- Okay, I'm muted. Are you sure?
- [Rose] <i>They're all around the building.</i>

44:15.152 --> 44:16.986
Every time you change direction,
so do they.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.321
They're listening to us.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.490
<i>They know we're here.</i>

44:20.324 --> 44:21.366
Catherine.

44:21.367 --> 44:25.662
Heading up capability development,
the contracts put me in close proximity

44:25.663 --> 44:28.666
to a lot of difficult-to-procure
information.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.124
That's it?

44:30.125 --> 44:33.795
Lots of DoD contractors
carry top-secret clearance.

44:33.796 --> 44:37.090
What makes your... access so special?

44:37.091 --> 44:39.759
[Catherine] This would be
our newest contract.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.011
Cyber division for the NSA

44:42.012 --> 44:46.308
on the front lines of network security
for the federal government.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.977
And just like that,
you're ready to sell out your country?

44:49.978 --> 44:51.355
If the price is right.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.527
Go handle it.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.239
So...

45:01.031 --> 45:02.241
can we do business?

45:02.741 --> 45:05.743
I don't have any of them anywhere.
I... I can't even tell you where to go.

45:05.744 --> 45:06.828
[Peter] <i>I'll figure something out.</i>

45:06.829 --> 45:09.872
We gotta draw them away.
Clear a path so I can get to Catherine.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.332
Okay. Be careful.

45:11.333 --> 45:12.376
Going comms on.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.045
[suspenseful music swelling]

45:16.046 --> 45:18.631
Wait, I think I see some movement
on the fourth floor.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.926
<i>There's an empty apartment
on the northeast corner.</i>

45:21.927 --> 45:23.970
[Peter] <i>I'll head down,
see if I can get a better view.</i>

45:23.971 --> 45:25.597
We know he's somewhere in the building.

45:27.182 --> 45:29.393
We need to start from the roof
and make our way down.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.243
We need someone to cover the south side.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.287
Roger. I'll scan the roof and head down.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.080
[Solomon] It's risky, isn't it?

45:51.081 --> 45:54.208
To jeopardize our relationship
for a friend?

45:54.209 --> 45:55.543
How do you mean?

45:55.544 --> 45:58.212
[Solomon] If I moved forward
with Elizabeth and it doesn't work out,

45:58.213 --> 46:01.592
that would likely put an end
to our arrangement.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.678
I trust that you will be
satisfied with her.

46:05.679 --> 46:08.724
As satisfied as you have been with me.

46:09.558 --> 46:11.769
Can I have a word? In private.

46:22.488 --> 46:26.158
You know, in this line of work,
what we need, what we value,

46:26.658 --> 46:28.576
are reliable sources.

46:28.577 --> 46:32.663
People we know we can trust
to deliver what they say they can deliver.

46:32.664 --> 46:36.626
It's why we take our time
vetting our sources,

46:36.627 --> 46:38.211
cultivate assets we can trust.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.963
And why in all my years of doing this,

46:40.964 --> 46:46.220
never once has a source
ever referred us to someone else.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.387
That's the problem with New York.

46:48.388 --> 46:49.807
There's too many rats.

46:50.516 --> 46:51.808
No!

46:51.809 --> 46:52.726
[body thudding]

46:53.477 --> 46:55.604
No, no, no. Sit.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.315
[suspenseful music swelling]

47:04.530 --> 47:05.364
[Solomon] Relax.

47:06.907 --> 47:11.744
You... are gonna tell me
everything you know about Peter Sutherland

47:11.745 --> 47:15.082
and exactly what Night Action is.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.877
[Rose] You have another one coming
towards the south side of the building.

47:19.878 --> 47:20.879
Copy that.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.682
[panting] I'm almost there.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.417
[AC unit creaking]

48:08.802 --> 48:10.053
You gotta be kidding me.

48:10.846 --> 48:14.266
Yeah, I looked everywhere. He's not here.
Basement, roof, none of it.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.895
- We'll have to check every room.
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

48:22.941 --> 48:24.109
[AC unit snapping]

48:26.820 --> 48:27.862
[man] We got eyes on.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.113
Sutherland!

48:29.114 --> 48:30.239
[Peter] They're on my six!

48:30.240 --> 48:31.825
[intense music playing]

[lock clicking]

48:38.123 --> 48:39.958
[banging on door]

48:40.542 --> 48:43.252
- [Rose] <i>Peter?</i>
- [Peter] <i>Found a way out of the basement.</i>

48:43.253 --> 48:45.922
<i>- Where should I go?</i>
- Can you make it to Amsterdam Avenue?

48:45.923 --> 48:48.633
There's a bus leaving now.
It's heading west.

48:48.634 --> 48:50.969
- [Peter] <i>I'm on my way.</i>
- [man] Back out front!

49:00.395 --> 49:02.021
- Shit.
- [Rose] <i>Did you make it to the bus?</i>

49:02.022 --> 49:03.397
- Barely. Am I clear?
- [Rose] <i>Yeah.</i>

49:03.398 --> 49:05.107
<i>Seven stops. I'll pick you up.</i>

49:05.108 --> 49:07.361
We'll keep on it as long as we can.
Grab some wheels.

49:14.660 --> 49:15.701
- [Peter] <i>Hey.</i>
- They're gone.

49:15.702 --> 49:17.119
[Rose] <i>Now you're in the clear.</i>

49:17.120 --> 49:20.081
Be fast. Doubt you have more than
five minutes before they realize.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.291
I'll figure it out.

49:28.298 --> 49:30.841
- Where is Peter?
- I don't know who Peter Sutherland is.

49:30.842 --> 49:32.678
- You don't know who that is?
- [Catherine] No.

49:35.681 --> 49:36.515
[keypad beeping]

49:37.641 --> 49:39.100
[exhaling] Hurry.

49:39.101 --> 49:42.228
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.814
I don't even know
what I can say to convince you.

49:44.815 --> 49:49.027
[Solomon] Well, maybe, if I get a towel
and a bucket of water, I'll convince you.

49:50.278 --> 49:51.113
[floor creaking]

49:53.407 --> 49:54.574
