l never have behaved
like this before.

56:52.376 --> 56:54.936
But on the other hand,

56:55.913 --> 56:58.981
l've never been
in love before.

56:58.982 --> 57:00.382
Ever.

57:19.903 --> 57:21.304
Afternoon, Carla.

57:21.305 --> 57:22.405
Hi, Sherman.

57:22.406 --> 57:24.040
How are you doing today?

57:24.041 --> 57:25.341
Pretty good.

57:25.342 --> 57:28.511
l come over to see
how things were going
with you and Buddy.

57:28.512 --> 57:30.513

57:30.514 --> 57:34.116
We went out last night.
lt was great. We had
such a wonderful time.

57:34.117 --> 57:36.585
And then all of a sudden
he runs out of the club.

57:36.586 --> 57:38.354
He has some allergic reaction.

57:38.355 --> 57:39.956
l don't even know
if he's all right.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.057
He's fine.

57:41.058 --> 57:43.059
He told me
that his lip swelled up,

57:43.060 --> 57:44.760
he put ice on it
and the swelling came down.

57:44.761 --> 57:45.928
Kinda strange, huh?

57:45.929 --> 57:48.431
Well, did he even ask
about me?

57:48.432 --> 57:51.901
Did he say why he didn't
call me and let me know
he was all right?

57:51.902 --> 57:53.569
Carla, Buddy's kind of
unreliable.

57:53.570 --> 57:55.071
He's kind of
what you call

57:55.072 --> 57:57.540
a "here today,
gone tomorrow"
kind of fellow.

57:57.541 --> 57:59.308
Oh, l see.
Mmm-hmm.

57:59.309 --> 58:03.412
So he had you talk to me
because he's not interested
anymore.

58:03.413 --> 58:05.514
No, it's nothing
quite like that.
Look.

58:05.515 --> 58:09.185
l know what it feels like
to be brushed off,
and it's okay.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.053
This is all my fault.

58:11.054 --> 58:13.723
l should've never
encouraged you
to go out with Buddy.

58:13.724 --> 58:16.090
Sherman, you have been
so sweet.

58:16.793 --> 58:20.252
l'll just have to
forget about him.
l'll see you later.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.526

58:24.634 --> 58:26.502

58:26.503 --> 58:29.472

about you and l,
for a second.

58:29.473 --> 58:31.407

58:33.076 --> 58:35.277

what you were doing later,

gonna get together.

58:38.281 --> 58:41.050

58:55.766 --> 58:57.099
Yes, l would.

58:57.100 --> 59:00.002

going to be enough food?

59:00.003 --> 59:02.495

that's going to be a problem.

do you realize
there's a gene in your DNA

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:40.148
that routes this
straight to your fat cells,

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.350

unsightly conditions.

No, that's the thing.
There isn't gonna be a later.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.276
JASON: Professor,
what did you do last night?

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:12.480
Jason,
l have such a bad hangover,
l honestly do not remember.

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:15.517
Well, the good news is
l'm not going to kill you,

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:17.185
not physically, anyway.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.287
l am, however,
going to kill you
professionally.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.256
You're not only fired
from this institution,

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.824
but l'm going to make sure
you never get hired

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.025
by any other college
in the state,

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.795
the country, the world,
maybe even the universe.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:30.231
Unless, of course,
they're looking for teachers
on Planet Fat.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.366
Oh, by the way,

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:34.135
Buddy Love is going to
be using your invitation
to the alumni ball,

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.738
so show a little school spirit
and see that he gets it.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.606
(SINGING) We're in the money

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.974
Put that food down!
They ate yesterday!

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:47.148
...really tight
and say, "Yes, l can."

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.550
Say it again.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:50.781
LANCE AND AUDIENCE:
Yes, l can!

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.593
Hey, chunky drawers!
Hey, tank ass!

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:01.496
What are you eating?
Mu·in? Strudel? Put it down.
Let me talk to you.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:05.266
lf you're receiving
this message, that means
you went and plumped back up

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:08.803
to your usual, fat, sorry,
stuff-my-face-till-
l'm almost-dead self.

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:11.239
ls that what you did?
Shame on you, Sherman!

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.542
Do you know
what you did last night?
You had the time of your life.

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.244
Do you know
you can get arrested
in ·· states

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.179
for the shit you did
just last night?

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.546
(GIGGLING)

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:21.783
Oh, my goodness!

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.118
You know what you need to do?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.753
You need to go down
to the laboratory

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:26.755
and mix up another batch
of this blue stuff.

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.724
Come on back to the party,
Sherman, because Carla
doesn't want you.

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:32.027
She wants me. Me, not you.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.030
So come join me
because you can't beat me.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:38.733
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me!

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:41.202
Yes, l can!

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.603
(BUDDY LAUGHS)
Yes, l can.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:49.611
Professor, l got your
message. What's up?

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.280
l'm going
to that alumni ball tonight,
and l'm gonna reclaim my life.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.949
Yes! l'm so glad
to hear you say that.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.851
Get things straight
with Miss Purty,

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:58.420
and l'm gonna get that grant
from Harlan Hartley.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.687
Excellent.

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:03.284
Jason, we have seen
the last of Buddy Love.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:11.123
(BIG BAND PLAYS lN THE MOOD)

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.711
Horace, good to see you.
The jitterbug contest
just started.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.914
l'm kidding, l'm kidding.
Your table's upstairs.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.916
That's anotherjoke.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.819
When did you marry
Sharon Stone?

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.555
Keep those legs crossed.

01:16:33.556 --> 01:16:36.891
Hartley. Damn it.
And where the hell
is Buddy Love?

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.293
No sign of him yet, sir.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:39.627
Here's an idea.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:40.695
Find him!

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.030
Yes, sir.

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.598
Harlan.
Well, Richmond.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.999
Where's your
Professor Buddy Love?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.201
Oh, with you
it's always business.

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:47.802
Let's get to know each other
man-to-man.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.070
Now, if our files are correct,

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:51.439
you and your fabulous wife
have a terrific daughter.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.708
l'm divorced,
and my daughter is in rehab.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.877
So you're saying
our files are not correct.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.846
Listen,
you pompous butt-kisser.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.215
l have a check in my pocket
for $10 million.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:03.117
Your Buddy Love
has till midnight
to prove that formula works.

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:05.653
He'll be here,
the formula works,
and you have the check.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.089
Really? On you now?
Because on behalf of...
Which pocket?

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:11.059
No, don't tell me.
Let me smell it. Punch?

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.228
Oh, come on, now.
Look at this.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:15.430
l can't eat this.
This stuff is too tiny.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:16.931
l can't get full
off this mess!

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.601
l think it's wonderful,
all the precious
little finger foods.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:21.202
Finger food?
l got a finger for them.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.004
l ain't paid no $100 ticket
for no finger food.

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:25.473
l could go down to Subway,
get me a sandwich for $3.

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.876
l gotta pay a $100 ticket
for finger food?

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.677
You must be crazy
to think l'm gonna eat this...

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:30.912
You're getting on
my damn nerves!

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.113
Shut up!
l'm hungry!

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:35.083
There's Carla. l wonder if
she's seen Sherman. Carla!

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:36.552
Carla. Oh.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.685
(LAUGHING)

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:42.824
(LAUGHING)
Oh, you look fabulous.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.325
Thank you, Mrs. Klump.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.693
Have you seen Sherman?

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:46.828
Yeah, where's Sherman at?

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.830
l ain't come
to pay no $100 ticket
to suffer this alone.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.064
Cletus, shut up, please!

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.500
Hey! That's strike two.

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.170
l don't think Sherman
will be coming tonight.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.572
Yes, he is.
Sherman called me and told me
make sure we was here.

01:17:57.573 --> 01:17:59.374
He got a big announcement
to make.

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:01.609
Something about getting it
all off his chest.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.379
Have you noticed
that Sherman's been acting
kind of strange lately?

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.215
Sherman has definitely
been acting strange lately.

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.250
l knew it!
See, Cletus? l told you.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:12.787
You really think
l be listening to you.
l ain't listening to you!

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.689
Well, Mrs. Klump,
l hope you have
a wonderful evening.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:18.293
Oh, you do the same.
Thank you so much.
So precious.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:19.527
Look at your
little purple dress.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.462
They gonna think we twins.

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:22.697
(CHUCKLING)
Mr. Klump.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.932
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:26.000
Fabulous.

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.803
You know, Cletus,
l think something's going on
between her and Sherman.

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:31.439
You don't go get up
in Sherman's business.
That's Sherman's business.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.908
Sherman's business?
That's my business.
Sherman is my baby.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:36.344
Sherman's 35 years old!
What you talking about
he's your baby?

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:37.979
l don't wanna hear it.
Shut up, please!

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.581
Carla!
That's strike three, damn it!

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:41.716
Don't you walk away
from me, God damn it!

Hey, this is the last
of it, Professor.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.421
l'll tell you this, Jason.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:49.490
lf l'm gonna change my life,
it's not gonna come
from some magic drink.

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:53.724
Gotta come from a lot
of hard work and exercise
and plenty of these.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.490
Good bye, Buddy Love.
Hello, Megashake.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.490

(SCREAMING)

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:06.706
Professor?

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.145
Oh!

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:14.315
l lost 300 pounds
in 30 seconds!

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.617
Thanks, Megashake!

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:17.352
You tricked him!

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:18.753
You damn right, hamster boy.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.121
l knew Sherman
was gonna go soft on me.

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.090
That can wreak havoc
on a man's sex life.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:23.825
(LAUGHING)

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:25.426
See, l've done
some calculations of my own.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.161
lf l drink 500 milliliters
of formula,

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.429
l'll have enough
cellular stability

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.697
to be rid of Sherman's ass
forever!

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:32.266
You drink that much formula
at one time
and it will kill you!

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.601
lf l drink it all at once,
yes.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.737
lf l drink half now
and half later, that's safe.

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:37.939
At midnight, l don't have
to worry about turning
into no Klumpkin.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.241
lf you don't mind, l have
a date at the alumni ball,

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.676
and you have a date
with linoleum.

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.145

(MAMA KLUMP LAUGHS)

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:51.986
No, no, no, child.
Not a wild party.
Not Sherman.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:54.055
He's too shy
for something like that.
He hates parties.

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:57.458
ln fact, we tried
to have a party for Sherman
when he was 1·-years-old

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.662
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:03.097
Well, l must admit,
it didn't seem like
the Sherman l knew.

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:04.265
Oh, no, not my baby.

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.767
Maybe he loaned his house
out to somebody

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:07.268
or one of his buddies
was throwing a party.

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.503

in my pocket? Or am l just
happy to see you?

Oh, you know you loved it.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:14.776

you're talking to,

to me like that again,
l'll kill you!

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.505
l don't mean that
as a euphemism. l mean,
l'm gonna literally kill you.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:48.841

and cut off your air supply
until you pass away!
