[Azita in Farsi]
Farhad, what are you doing?

00:11.344 --> 00:12.470
[in Farsi] I'm going back...

00:13.138 --> 00:14.055
[Azita gasping]

00:14.764 --> 00:16.223
You have to tell her the truth.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.559
She could tell the mission
and then we'd have nothing.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.063
- What aren't they telling me?
- I think he might have broken his arm.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.023
[Noor] Thank you for being honest.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.859
It's not easy getting clemency
for someone convicted of war crimes.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.652
What have you done besides signing checks?

00:28.653 --> 00:30.529
How are the preparations
for tomorrow going?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.781
- [Markus] We're on schedule.
<i>- Save me a seat on the truck.</i>

00:32.782 --> 00:35.034
- Really?
- I understand the plan now.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.371
[in Farsi] Can you identify the person
in this photo?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.082
[Noor gasping]

00:41.708 --> 00:44.418
[in Farsi] No, that's impossible.
Impossible, impossible.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.545
[Catherine] These have nothing to do
with Foxglove.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.630
Noor's brother is dead for nothing?

00:48.631 --> 00:50.841
The only way forward is through Solomon.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.761
A new point of contact.
Whoever traded this DGSE intel.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.095
Agent Jacqueline Laurent.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.389
- What do you want then?
- An introduction.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.642
- Jacqueline tells me you buy information.
- What else did she tell you?

01:00.643 --> 01:01.560
They're listening.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.145
<i>- They know we're here.</i>
- Catherine.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.607
The problem with New York,
there's too many rats.

01:06.107 --> 01:06.983
No! [grunting]

01:07.984 --> 01:09.193
[Solomon] Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.654
You are gonna tell me
everything you know about Peter Sutherland

01:12.655 --> 01:15.784
and exactly what Night Action is.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.536

02:02.247 --> 02:03.164
You need help, sir?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.124
Pardon?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.625
You should be careful.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.837
People drive way too fast
around this corner here.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.839
This is a really, really bad spot.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.632
Right. Thanks.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.843
I called a tow truck.
I'll be out of here soon.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.137
Oh. Well, I'll... I'll wait until they show.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.806
No, it's all right. Uh, it won't be long.

02:20.807 --> 02:21.724
I don't mind.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.061
Well, I, uh, hate to interrupt your night.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.272
Looks like somebody
might be waiting for you.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.731
You helping a grandparent?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.316
No, my sister.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.026
We rented some of these things,

02:33.027 --> 02:39.325
like the wheelchair and the shower stool,
for a few months, but, uh, now we, uh...

02:40.285 --> 02:41.743
We've made peace with the situation,

02:41.744 --> 02:44.831
so I'm making some permanent changes
so that she can get around better.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.543
You, uh, mind if I ask what happened?

02:49.043 --> 02:50.295
It was a hit-and-run.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.048
She actually lost both of her legs.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.549
[man] I'm sorry.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.636
- Police catch the guy who did it?
- No, they did not.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.223
You up early or up late?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.142
Early.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.144
I got some business
first thing in the city.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.228
Wall Street, right?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.939
[chuckling] No.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.234
But I suppose you could call me a trader.

03:14.194 --> 03:18.113
Uh, anyhow, my driver
didn't show up this morning.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.200
I tried calling him, but his number
is completely disconnected.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.411
Goddamn. Looks like you're gonna need
a new driver too.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.329
Perhaps.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.415
[car engine revving in distance]

03:28.833 --> 03:30.793
[car whooshing]

03:34.005 --> 03:37.634
You really made peace...
with what happened to your sister?

03:39.761 --> 03:40.803
I had no choice.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.308
I find there's always a choice.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.770
The cops had some leads.
I kept calling to push them.

03:49.771 --> 03:53.148
But I think maybe they thought
she was just some poor Puerto Rican victim

03:53.149 --> 03:55.693
and they gave up looking.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.321
- Then you gave up too?
- No.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.492
I went up and down that road where it
happened for months, hoping to find them.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.744
I knew it was a black BMW that hit her.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.290
Carried a bat in my truck for months,
just in case.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.669
But it didn't matter,
because in the end, my sister needed me.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.964
So I figured if nobody had our backs,
I had to have hers.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.050
[dramatic music playing]

04:20.551 --> 04:22.970
- Well, thanks for the company.
- Yeah.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.932
- Listen, can I offer you some--
- Oh, no, please. It was nothing.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.643
Take care. And be safe.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.102
You as well.

[music fades]

05:30.747 --> 05:32.206
There's a little slack.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.292
You want me to tighten it?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.336
No, I'm comfortable.

05:38.046 --> 05:38.963
How about you?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.968
Well, I've gotta hand it to you.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.637
This place is fucking depressing.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.184
Is it anything like that basement office
of yours in the White House?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.645
It's weird how the feds hired you,

05:55.521 --> 05:57.398
even though your dad was a traitor.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.443
They ever tell you how they caught him?

06:00.943 --> 06:02.569
You're not dying to know?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.571
The FBI closed their investigation.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.076
The FBI never investigated your father
before he was arrested.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.410
None of the three-letter outfits did.

06:10.411 --> 06:14.374
Unless there's some other off-book agency.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.127
Night Action mean anything to you?

06:19.128 --> 06:20.670
Peter, out here.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.757
[ominous music playing]

06:27.512 --> 06:29.180
[door creaking]

06:34.435 --> 06:37.771
I just got off with Mosley.
He's on his way to question Solomon.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.273
He knows about Night Action.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.443
- Did they investigate my father?
- He's trying to throw you off-balance.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.154
Just trying to find
some weakness to exploit.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.489
Do not give him one.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.615
[siren wailing in distance]

06:48.616 --> 06:50.660
Probably just repeating
something he heard.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.290
They were patched into our comms.
That's how they knew the meet was a setup.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.835
And why Solomon killed Laurent.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.212
Solomon bought intel
from Warren at the CIA.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.923
He bought intel from Laurent at the DGSE.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.675
[Peter] Do you think he has an FBI agent?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.928
Someone who would've given him
the decryption keys to our radio signals?

07:09.929 --> 07:13.014
That would explain how he was able
to get the jump on Alice and I in Bangkok.

07:13.015 --> 07:16.394
'Cause we were on comms when they told us
to go to the river for extraction.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.729
Just thought it was a mole
inside Night Action.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.441
You mean you thought it was me?

07:22.191 --> 07:23.109
[Peter sighing]

07:24.110 --> 07:25.528
I didn't know what to think.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.697
I get it.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.909
- I'm sorry.
- I get it.

07:33.077 --> 07:36.329
Solomon has connections with government
agencies all around the world,

07:36.330 --> 07:37.956
but what is the motive?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.376
Laurent gave him the list
of Iranian dissidents.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.836
He gave it to the Iranian ambassador.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.923
What if Solomon just brokers deals
to buy and sell intel?

07:48.176 --> 07:50.635
If so, who did he sell
the Foxglove intel to?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.095
- [cell phone vibrating]
- I don't know.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.556
Sorry, it's Rose.
Something's going on with Noor.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.974
Is she ready to be picked up?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.851
No idea, but she's freaking out.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.562
Rose is going to meet her.
I should probably be there too.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.815
Fine. I'll start working on Solomon
until Mosley arrives.

08:03.816 --> 08:04.733

08:52.406 --> 08:53.824
[in Farsi] How do you think?

08:55.284 --> 08:56.994
I was worried about you.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.249
I'm taking the morning off
so we can go get breakfast.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.793
I'm not hungry.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.503
Come with me.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.631
- Maybe you'll change your mind.
- No, I just need to go for a walk.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.301
- I need to clear my head.
- Then I'll go with you.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.261
We can talk and--

09:14.262 --> 09:15.471
Talk about what?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.516
My brother is dead,
and my mother is missing.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.686
Do you think I want to talk about that
with you of all people?

09:22.687 --> 09:23.646
[elevator beeping]

09:27.483 --> 09:28.817
I'm sorry, Javad.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.152
I didn't mean...

09:31.487 --> 09:33.197
I just need to be alone right now.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.063
Sorry?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.149
You flew to Europe and back
in barely a day,

10:09.150 --> 10:10.776
and you haven't touched your espresso.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.195
Oh. [chuckling softly]

10:13.904 --> 10:15.780
Yeah, I'm good, actually.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.282
Heart's racing a bit today.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.160
Shall we take it easy, then?

10:19.660 --> 10:22.872
I was thinking, um, Bergdorf's first.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.332
And then a little massage?

10:25.333 --> 10:29.086
Or a few galleries,
followed by lunch in Chelsea.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.008
Or we could crawl into bed,
and I'll help you feel better.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.552
Sorry, darling. I'm in meetings all day.

Meetings?

[Tomás sniffing]

10:49.023 --> 10:51.817
...you've built a successful life
without Viktor.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.610
We have.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.363
Whatever he's asking of you,

10:56.364 --> 11:00.034
don't risk us for him.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.080
You don't owe him anything.

- To a tee.
- Good. I'll get changed.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.234
- You don't have to go.
- My father insisted I take the lead.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.194
[bag rustling, zipping]

12:23.659 --> 12:24.493
What's wrong?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.955
Are you ready to go to the safe house?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.084
Where are my mother and brother right now?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.127
You'll see them tonight.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.338
And there will be a doctor
at the safe house?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.675
- A doctor?
- You said Farhad's arm was broken.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.762
Right. Um,
he's already had medical attention.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.680
He has?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.389
[Rose] Yeah.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.351
Peter and Catherine
are taking care of him. Don't worry.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.481
I know my brother was killed in Isfahan.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.940
[somber music playing]

12:55.941 --> 12:57.359
[Noor] I saw the pictures.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.196
You knew all along, didn't you?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.698
- Didn't you?
- Yes.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.660
I asked you if my family was safe,
and you lied to me.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.288
I am so sorry, Noor.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.540
- I--
- Where is my mother?

13:12.249 --> 13:13.834
- With Sami.
- Where?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.336
- I don't know.
- I want to speak to her now.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.421
I need to know that she's alive.

13:18.422 --> 13:22.176
I... I don't know how to reach her,
but, Noor, she is alive, I swear.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.385
I never wanted to lie to you.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.762
- But you did anyway.
- [Peter] Hey.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.598
My brother died on your watch,
and you covered it up.

13:28.599 --> 13:32.018
Leave Rose alone. She had nothing to do
with the extraction going bad.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.187
No, it's your fault.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.606
Farhad's blood is on your hands.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.525
Shame on you.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.902
Shame on all of you.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.404
I'm sorry.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.406
I didn't wanna tell you
until we got you out of the mission.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.991
We needed to make sure you were safe.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.246
You didn't want to tell me because
you needed me to hand over the file.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.208
Yeah. That too.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.376
Yes.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.962
You want to tell me the truth?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.757
Tell me how my brother was killed.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.552
[Peter] You sure?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.097
Okay.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.018
Sami was taking your family
back to the plane.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.396
They were stopped by police officers.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.191
Farhad changed his mind about leaving.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.153
He stole one of the police officers' guns,
and he shot at Sami.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.990
Sami had to return fire.
He didn't have a choice, Noor.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.492
Farhad wouldn't do that.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.871
He isn't like that.
He's... He's just a child.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.498
I'm sorry, that's what he did.

14:36.125 --> 14:40.295
I know how much your brother meant to you,
and none of this was supposed to happen.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.964
Normally we would've had
more time to plan.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.716
It's my fault for needing it done quickly?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.844
No. It's not your fault.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.971
It's nobody's fault. It just...

14:50.598 --> 14:51.890
It just went wrong.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.392
[Noor breathing heavily]

14:54.310 --> 14:56.102
I want to speak to my mother.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.103
[Peter] And you will.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.480
If you come with me,
I can take you to a safe house

14:59.481 --> 15:02.442
where the Iranians can't touch you,
and Sami will bring your mom.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.069
The man who killed my brother?

15:05.821 --> 15:08.782
If you have my mother,
put her on the phone right now.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.577
Call him, Peter.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.579
Call Sami.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.587
[phone line ringing]

15:22.630 --> 15:24.381
[machine] <i>Please leave
a message.</i> [beeping]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.719
You don't have my mother, do you?

15:29.553 --> 15:31.388
For all I know, she's still in Isfahan.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.058
Maybe I'll go back
to the mission to find out.

15:35.059 --> 15:39.062
No, no, no. By now they'll know
that your family tried to escape Iran.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
It's too dangerous for you to go back.

15:42.900 --> 15:43.734
Now, look,

15:44.443 --> 15:45.569
I made a mistake.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.696
I did. I'm sorry.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.865
But your mom is here.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.240
She's in New York,

15:51.241 --> 15:53.910
and you can see her tonight
if you come with me.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.205
I'm not going anywhere with you.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.207
[Peter] Fine.

15:58.916 --> 16:03.045
I'll have Sami pick you up
at 112th and Amsterdam tonight at 11 p.m.,

16:04.254 --> 16:05.923
and I'll have him bring your mother.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.809
[dramatic music playing]

16:28.112 --> 16:30.114
[camera shutter clicking]

[suspenseful music playing]

16:46.130 --> 16:47.673
[camera shutter clicking]

16:57.391 --> 16:58.474
[indistinct chatter]

16:58.475 --> 16:59.976
[Tomás] Okay let's bring that in.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.271
- Is that the last one? Good.
- [man] Yeah.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.439
Let's get you out.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.565
Secure that, Goran.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.068
And this is everything here?
Okay, give me the pages. Thank you.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.487
- [Tomás] Let's close it up.
- Yes.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.196
[truck gate creaking]

17:12.197 --> 17:14.908
- All right. Let's go. We have everything.
- All right.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.912
[suspenseful music playing]

17:28.005 --> 17:29.338
[brakes squealing]

17:29.339 --> 17:30.715
[truck hissing]

17:30.716 --> 17:31.717
[man] Transport papers.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.056
What happened to Kenny?
This is usually his run.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.266
He's out sick.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.020
- Him and his whole crew?
- I go where they tell me.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.108
- You guys transport hazmats often?
- [Markus] Yeah, often enough.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.569
- What'd y'all pick up?
- Read our papers. It's all in there.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.821
Sir, is there a problem?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.031
- Problem?
- Forgive him.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.076
Our client made it clear they don't
want us talking about their shipments

17:58.077 --> 17:59.452
with anyone for security reasons.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.081
We all had to sign
confidentiality agreements.

18:02.998 --> 18:03.832
One moment.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.632
No. Be calm.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.550
I am calm.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.305
Have a safe trip.

18:18.889 --> 18:19.723
Thank you.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.644
See? Not so hard.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.938
[gate whirring]

18:42.037 --> 18:43.247
[music fades]

18:52.339 --> 18:54.341
[Solomon wincing, grunting]

18:57.261 --> 18:59.512
We know what your organization does.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.765
You buy, sell, and trade information
all around the world.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.142
[Solomon sighing]

19:04.143 --> 19:08.272
We know Warren Stocker gave you
information on Foxglove in Bangkok.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.067
- What are you planning to do with it?
- Where's Peter?

19:14.194 --> 19:15.736
Is he your, what, trainee?

19:15.737 --> 19:17.823
Did you sell the Foxglove intel?

19:19.658 --> 19:20.617
Who has it?

19:21.118 --> 19:23.411
I wanna talk to Peter alone.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.290
Federal agents
are on their way to pick you up.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.375
Seeing as you trafficked
classified information

19:29.376 --> 19:30.918
involving chemical weapons,

19:30.919 --> 19:33.838
I do not imagine
a promising future for you.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.840
So if your specialty is cutting deals,

19:35.841 --> 19:39.344
you cut one with me,
and I'll see what I can do for you.

19:41.138 --> 19:41.972
Think about it.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.267
You wanna know about Foxglove?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.061
Look into cyanogen.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.065
Anything else, send in Peter.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.943
[tense music playing]

20:01.325 --> 20:03.326
I get you're trying
to protect the country.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.911
I want that, too, obviously.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.247
But Noor didn't deserve any of this.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.665
[dramatic music playing]

20:09.666 --> 20:13.212
I'm dealing with limited,
shitty options here.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.796
I'm doing what I can, Rose.

20:15.797 --> 20:19.259
I'm trying to do what's right,
But what... what is that at this point?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.930
When my aunt and uncle were killed,
Farr lied to me to get what she wanted,

20:23.931 --> 20:25.432
and I hated her for it.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.268
Now I've done the same thing to Noor.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.731
I need to go back to California.
I... [sniffing]

20:33.732 --> 20:35.775
I can't be involved with this anymore.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.485
[siren wailing in distance]

20:37.486 --> 20:38.862
[cell phone vibrating]

20:39.988 --> 20:40.822
Sorry.

20:41.823 --> 20:42.657
Yeah?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.701
[Catherine] <i>I need you back here
right now.</i>

20:45.786 --> 20:46.870
[elevator beeping]

20:50.874 --> 20:53.334
- [in Farsi] Have you seen Javad?
- [in Farsi] He's at the office.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.712
He said he took the morning off,
and I need to speak to him.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.924
[man] He wants to speak with you as well.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.343
He may have news about your mother.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.012
My mother? Really?

21:04.888 --> 21:06.473
[man] I'll take you back to the mission.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.558
[suspenseful music playing]

21:09.851 --> 21:11.103
[elevator beeping]

21:19.945 --> 21:21.112
[door closing]

21:21.113 --> 21:22.488
Hey. What's going on??

21:22.489 --> 21:25.199
Cyanogen was just stolen
from a chemical plant

21:25.200 --> 21:27.118
outside Allentown, Pennsylvania.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.870
It's a chemical compound
mentioned in Foxglove.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.372
Solomon just told me.

21:31.373 --> 21:35.042
Ten minutes later, federal agents learned
a shipment of cyanogen

21:35.043 --> 21:38.587
was intercepted by a crew
with forged transport papers.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.966
It's gotta be the same people
that stole the mobile lab.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.844
Wait, hold on. Solomon tipped you off?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.513
How do we know he's not trying
to spin us off in the wrong direction?

21:47.514 --> 21:48.431
I'm not sure.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.599
But if these terrorists
have the mobile lab

21:50.600 --> 21:52.226
and they're stealing the materials

21:52.227 --> 21:55.104
that can make
one of Foxglove's chemical agents--

21:55.105 --> 21:58.525
Then they'll have a weapon capable
of killing hundreds, even thousands.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.401
[Catherine] I got a C in chemistry,

22:00.402 --> 22:04.030
but I'm guessing it takes more than
one compound to make a chemical weapon.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.033
So we need to figure out
what else they need.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.825
Did you check the CIA file?

22:07.826 --> 22:11.162
It's an executive summary
with a list of nine chemical agents.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.205
There's nothing on how they're made.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.334
Uh, there's a roster of PhDs too.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.669
Those must be the scientists
that worked on the project.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.129
We can ask one of them.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.672
[tense music playing]

22:21.673 --> 22:23.257
Just ask them to discuss

22:23.258 --> 22:26.927
an illegal chemical weapons program
they participated in?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.763
I'm sorry, is there a plan B?

22:28.764 --> 22:30.056
[keyboard clacking]

22:30.057 --> 22:32.892
[Rose] Okay, this one's at Caltech.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.227
DuPont.

22:34.811 --> 22:35.812
This one's dead.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.730
Okay, here we go.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.484
A chemistry professor at Columbia.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.985
Dr. Wilfred Cole.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.111
This is ridiculous.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.989
We have Solomon right here,
and he knows what's going on.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.493
We can't waste time running around
the city chasing a nothing lead.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.619
I can.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.288
I'll go to Columbia
while you guys talk to Solomon.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.248
I can't be near him anyway.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.249
[bag zipping]

22:57.250 --> 22:59.293
- Fine, I'll go with you.
- [Catherine] No, you stay.

22:59.294 --> 23:02.546
Solomon said he's only talking to you.
We're running out of time.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.298
You need to see
what you can get out of him.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.258
Yes, ma'am.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.928
Um, can we talk on the way out?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.222
Okay.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.726
[dramatic music playing]

23:20.482 --> 23:23.944
If the offer for Secret Service
protection still stands,

23:25.070 --> 23:26.695
I'm ready to go back to California.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.780
[Catherine] Are you sure?

23:27.781 --> 23:29.865
I meant what I said. You've been valuable.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.034
I know there's a lot of shit
going down right now,

23:32.035 --> 23:34.412
but now you have Solomon,

23:34.413 --> 23:37.039
plus you and Peter
are back on the same page.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.958
I'll just be in the way at this point.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.794
All right. I'll set it up.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.131
Thanks. I'll get this done,
and I'll give you a call.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.177
[door creaking, closing]

23:49.970 --> 23:51.720
[indistinct chatter]

23:51.721 --> 23:53.807
[tense music playing]

24:03.984 --> 24:05.277
[in Farsi] Please have a seat.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.328
Javad will be with you shortly.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.665
[door closing]

24:19.291 --> 24:20.125
[lock clicking]

24:22.043 --> 24:24.045
[tense music swelling]

24:27.340 --> 24:29.342
[music fades]

24:32.762 --> 24:34.181
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.726
You seem more open-minded
than your handler.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.188
Can you trust her?

24:42.272 --> 24:44.816
I mean, really trust her?

24:45.442 --> 24:46.985
Who stole the cyanogen?

24:48.153 --> 24:50.071
Who's trying to make a chemical weapon?

24:51.781 --> 24:53.575
[Solomon sighing heavily]

24:55.577 --> 24:56.620
[Peter exhaling]

24:57.496 --> 24:59.663
[Peter] <i>You did five tours in Afghanistan.</i>

24:59.664 --> 25:02.667
Why betray a country
you fought so long to protect?

25:04.169 --> 25:05.212
Is this about money?

25:05.921 --> 25:08.548
What was the reason
your father betrayed his country?

25:09.049 --> 25:11.425
If this is just
a business transaction to you,

25:11.426 --> 25:14.970
why protect people that are trying
to kill American citizens with Foxglove?

25:14.971 --> 25:15.931
I mean...

25:16.681 --> 25:18.098
[Solomon exhaling]

25:18.099 --> 25:21.353
You're not covering for clients,
you're covering for a superior.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.187
[chuckling softly]

25:23.188 --> 25:26.399
[Peter] That overdressed guy in Bangkok,
that's him, right? That's your boss?

25:27.859 --> 25:30.862
After the Marines, you didn't have
a purpose, and he gave you one.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.489
Is that it?

25:34.324 --> 25:37.369
No, this isn't about him either.
This is about your sister, right?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.329
It's about Celeste?

25:40.830 --> 25:43.332
<i>That guy you work for
is behind KinCare Trust.</i>

25:43.333 --> 25:45.584
<i>He's taking care of Celeste, isn't he?</i>

25:45.585 --> 25:46.669
<i>After the accident,</i>

25:46.670 --> 25:49.088
she was crushed
with a lifetime of medical debt.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.881
You needed a way to take care of her,

25:50.882 --> 25:54.010
so you did the wrong things
for the right reasons.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.556
- Honestly, I can't blame you.
- Leave my sister out of it.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.932
She wasn't aware of our arrangement.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.351
If she's on your boss's payroll,
she's in deep shit.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.728
So tell us who you gave Foxglove to,

26:04.729 --> 26:07.106
and we won't press charges
against Celeste.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.732
[tense music playing]

26:08.733 --> 26:10.693
If you don't cooperate with us,

26:10.694 --> 26:12.903
we're gonna have Celeste
arrested for fraud.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.363
She knows you're alive, right?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.949
And she's been living off
your VA death benefits.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.827
So we'll just flag her
for defrauding the U.S. government.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.912
<i>She'll be dragged off
to a federal penitentiary,</i>

26:21.913 --> 26:24.957
and they're not known
for being friendly to the disabled.

26:24.958 --> 26:29.170
Is this what Night Action does?
Threaten civilians in wheelchairs?

26:29.754 --> 26:30.589
No.

26:32.757 --> 26:36.093
We stop assholes like you
from hurting our country.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.470
[door opening]

26:38.305 --> 26:39.180
Peter.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.766
Peter, outside.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.226
Now.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.687
[music fades]

26:50.984 --> 26:52.860
He confirmed
there's someone calling the shots.

26:52.861 --> 26:56.239
And you just confirmed
Night Action's existence to him.

26:56.823 --> 27:01.286
Neither one of us says
another word to him until Mosley arrives.

27:01.995 --> 27:02.829
[softly] Yeah.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.166
[suspenseful music playing]

27:10.587 --> 27:12.379
- [music fades]
- [indistinct chatter]

27:12.380 --> 27:13.465
[woman] Thanks.

27:13.965 --> 27:14.841
Dr. Cole?

27:15.342 --> 27:18.594
- [Wilfred] Yes.
- My name is Rose. I'm a master's student.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.930
I was just wondering if I could
ask you some questions for my thesis.

27:21.931 --> 27:22.849
Sure.

27:23.683 --> 27:26.560
I'm researching the history
of chemical weapons.

27:26.561 --> 27:30.230
- You're one of the preeminent--
- My field is chemistry, not warfare.

27:30.231 --> 27:33.360
It sounds like you ought to be speaking
with someone in the History Department.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.990
I'm here specifically
to ask you about Foxglove.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.407
The plant?

27:40.408 --> 27:41.409
[bag zipping]

27:45.580 --> 27:47.290
[ominous music playing]

27:47.916 --> 27:48.792
[Wilfred] Leave.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.627
Leave, or I'll call security.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.505
Dr. Cole, you must know,
the only reason I have this file

27:54.506 --> 27:56.799
is because I have access
to the top levels of government.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.759
This is real.

27:58.426 --> 28:01.262
I'm here because a shipment
of cyanogen was just stolen.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.223
What? When?

28:03.723 --> 28:04.556
[Rose] Today.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.892
We have reason to believe
someone is trying to synthesize

28:06.893 --> 28:09.562
one of the Foxglove weapons
listed in that file.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.523
We need your help to determine which one.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.901
Well, cyanogen is a component
of several weapons.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.570
Off the top of my head,
I don't know which ones.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.698
- Where's the rest?
- That's all that's left.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.157
The CIA's trying to bury it.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.118
Even if these people
get all the ingredients,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.661
they won't be able to make anything.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.164
They've also stolen
a military-grade mobile lab.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.249
- Who?
- We don't know.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.668
So the government's
trying to pin this on me?

28:32.669 --> 28:34.670
They're blaming something
that happened 20 years--

28:34.671 --> 28:37.173
- Dr. Cole, no.
- Don't fucking bullshit me!

28:40.969 --> 28:42.429
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.891
- Um, come... come with me.
- Where?

28:47.475 --> 28:48.934
You want answers or not?

28:48.935 --> 28:51.020
[suspenseful music playing]

28:55.191 --> 28:56.151
[truck hissing]

28:57.235 --> 28:58.777

28:59.946 --> 29:01.364

29:06.035 --> 29:06.870
[Markus] Hello.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.371
[man] <i>Stand by.</i>

29:09.289 --> 29:10.123
Thank you.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.626
[Markus breathing deeply, exhaling]

[phone clicking]

29:17.255 --> 29:18.213
[buttons clicking]

29:18.214 --> 29:20.716
- Something wrong?
- Sorry about that.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.510
We're heading into a shift change.

29:23.011 --> 29:23.844
Just a minute.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.929
[Markus scoffing]

29:25.513 --> 29:26.347
Shift change.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.099
[Tomás] Easy.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.851
- Everything's fine.
- Don't start.

29:30.852 --> 29:31.811

29:37.484 --> 29:39.610
Sir, can you step out of the truck?

29:39.611 --> 29:40.694
What's the problem?

29:40.695 --> 29:44.323
We believe there's been a mix-up.
Something's not right with your paperwork.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.910
[Tomás] Uh, we've been dealing with this
manager who's still learning the ropes.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.036
What... what's the issue?

29:49.037 --> 29:51.205
Your BOL doesn't match
what's in the system.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.415
[car door opening]

29:53.291 --> 29:54.166
[man grunting]

29:54.167 --> 29:55.376
[Markus] Open the gate!

29:56.503 --> 29:57.629
Go, go, go, go!

29:58.296 --> 29:59.589
- Fuck.

[Tomás's breath shuddering]

30:24.405 --> 30:25.323
[Markus] Get in!

- [birds chirping]

30:53.852 --> 30:55.143
[keys jangling]

30:55.144 --> 30:56.396
It's this way.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.860
Sorry for the mess.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.322
[door opening]

31:08.074 --> 31:09.409
My study's downstairs.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.996
After you.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.791
[footsteps receding]

31:38.688 --> 31:39.689
[switch clicking]

31:42.108 --> 31:43.860
Not what I was expecting.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.779
[chuckling] I agreed to embrace my wife's
minimalist aesthetic upstairs.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.908
Thankfully, this space is my own.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.161
Give me a hand with these, would you?
You can set them right there.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.748
Before I say anything
that's gonna get me imprisoned for life,

31:57.749 --> 32:00.335
tell me what you know
about Foxglove first.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.920
It started as a thought experiment.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.633
The government wanted to brainstorm
the future of chemical warfare.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.385
Get ahead of whatever adversaries
might be trying to develop,

32:10.386 --> 32:12.889
and create the antidotes in advance.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.892
But in order to do that,
they had to create the poisons.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.018
[safe clicking]

32:18.019 --> 32:19.896
You invented nine in total.

32:22.065 --> 32:26.401
[sighing] We spent months theorizing
chemical agents that could be weaponized,

32:26.402 --> 32:28.779
and we developed the antidotes
for some of them.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.031
But before we could determine
the antidotes for the rest,

32:31.032 --> 32:32.532
I was removed from the project.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.450
Why?

32:33.451 --> 32:35.786
I was only told
the program had been shuttered.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.664
And the NDA had real teeth,
so I couldn't ask around about it.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.375
The whole thing made me nervous...

32:42.418 --> 32:44.378
which is why I saved these.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.464
I took notes from memory
of our discussions.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.633
I never thought
these would amount to anything, but...

32:49.634 --> 32:50.593
Come over here.

32:53.972 --> 32:58.433
But then Viktor Bala
used a chemical weapon on his own people.

32:58.434 --> 32:59.935
After he was deposed,

32:59.936 --> 33:02.146
he claimed he'd gotten the weapons
from U.S. sources.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.982
The UN, the ICC
could find nothing to corroborate it.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.441
Everyone wrote Bala off

33:06.442 --> 33:09.153
as a delusional dictator
trying to deflect blame.

33:09.737 --> 33:12.531
But I noticed that
the victims of the attack

33:12.532 --> 33:14.950
had symptoms that were eerily similar

33:14.951 --> 33:17.411
to some of the chemical agents
we theorized.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.414
You think that the U.S.
created these chemical agents in secret,

33:20.415 --> 33:23.584
and someone
gave one of them to Viktor Bala?

33:24.085 --> 33:26.086
- That would be--
- Crazy, yeah.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.337
And I couldn't prove it.

33:27.338 --> 33:30.215
No one was even gonna acknowledge
this program even existed.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.844
So I... I prayed I was only paranoid.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.346
But then you walked into my office.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.265
[door banging]

33:37.849 --> 33:40.977
- What was that?
- It's just the back screen door. Sorry.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.729
Gloria? Everything all right?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.440
- [footsteps approaching]
- Gloria!

33:47.150 --> 33:48.567
Mom's outside unloading groceries.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.777
Go help your mom.
Tell her we've got a guest for dinner.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.030
[music fades]

33:55.616 --> 33:58.369
So if these thieves have cyanogen,

33:58.953 --> 34:00.455
what would they go after next?

34:01.080 --> 34:05.043
Look, it takes years to develop the skills
to get a subject to talk.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.961
It's my fault
for putting you in that position.

34:07.962 --> 34:10.088
- [cell phone vibrating]
- You're just new at this.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.465
It's Mosley.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.883
What's your ETA?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.635
[ominous music playing]

34:15.428 --> 34:16.262
They what?

34:16.929 --> 34:20.182
How can these chemicals be out
in the world when they can be weaponized?

34:20.183 --> 34:22.894
Chemicals are all around us.
Water is a chemical.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.854
So is sulfur dichloride.
Know what that is?

34:25.855 --> 34:26.772
[music fades]

34:26.773 --> 34:29.149
It's, uh, commonly found
in dyes and insecticides.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.317
What about ethylene?

34:30.318 --> 34:33.737
Uh, it's used to artificially ripen
fruits and vegetables, right?

34:33.738 --> 34:36.907
And what do you get when you treat
sulfur dichloride with ethylene?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.408
I don't know.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.952
You get mustard gas.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.748
[cell phone vibrating]

34:44.957 --> 34:45.916
Hello?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.375
[Catherine] <i>They got another one.</i>

34:47.376 --> 34:50.087
I'm putting you on speaker.
I'm here with Dr. Cole.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.130
[Catherine] <i>They got another
chemical compound.</i>

34:52.131 --> 34:53.840
- Which one?
- [Peter] <i>Oxamyl.</i>

34:53.841 --> 34:57.719
Dr. Cole, can you narrow the list
of possible Foxglove weapons

34:57.720 --> 34:59.137
they're trying to make?

34:59.138 --> 35:02.766
The only chemical agent
with both those components is called K.X.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.644
It's a fifth-generation blistering agent

35:05.645 --> 35:08.271
that's about ten times
as potent as lewisite.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.024
And we couldn't develop
an antidote for that one.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.944
What other chemical compounds
do they need to complete it?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.695
<i>Which ones would they be targeting next?</i>

35:15.696 --> 35:17.614
[Wilfred] My guess would be hydrazine-BH.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.575
It's a restricted precursor chemical
used in pharmaceuticals.

35:20.576 --> 35:23.495
I believe Trantow Pharmaceuticals
has a patent on it.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.580
[Catherine] <i>Peter, call Mosley.
Have him send teams</i>

35:25.581 --> 35:28.917
to each one of their research labs
in a hundred-mile radius.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.335
[Wilfred] <i>Trantow won't be making it.</i>

35:30.336 --> 35:34.131
They'd subcontract the manufacturing
process out to a private CMO.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.715
[keyboard clacking]

35:35.716 --> 35:37.259
[Rose] Manodeo Manufacturing.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.594
The two nearest sites
are in Long Island and Philly.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.971
[Catherine] <i>Okay, thanks.</i>

35:40.972 --> 35:42.764
[tense music playing]

35:42.765 --> 35:45.350
Mosley is on his way
to the site in Philadelphia,

35:45.351 --> 35:46.685
so I'll go to Long Island.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.311
You stay here and watch Solomon.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.604
You don't need me to come with?

35:49.605 --> 35:54.192
FBI, DHS, and DEA are sending teams.
We'll have more than enough firepower.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.820
- I'll stay and keep questioning Solomon.
- No, no.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.948
Just leave that to Mosley. Watch him.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.575
I'm not a babysitter, Catherine.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.328
First of all, I babysat for years,
and that shit is hard.

36:05.079 --> 36:09.916
Second, until Mosley and I get back,
just sit tight and guard that door.

36:09.917 --> 36:10.835
Okay.

36:14.964 --> 36:15.798
[door closing]

36:20.595 --> 36:22.346
[music fades]

36:24.473 --> 36:25.557
[door closing]

36:25.558 --> 36:26.475
[lock clicking]

36:28.936 --> 36:30.563
[in Farsi] What have you heard
about my mother?

36:32.231 --> 36:33.357
[in Farsi] She's safe.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.359
Where?

36:36.360 --> 36:37.402
[Javad] In Iran.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.197
We're taking care of her.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.908
Thank God.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.328
Can I speak with her?

36:47.079 --> 36:49.706
She's in no state to talk now.

36:49.707 --> 36:50.625
Why?

36:51.542 --> 36:52.501
Was she hurt?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.756
What aren't you telling me, Javad?

36:58.925 --> 37:00.468
I must ask you the same thing.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.263
I don't understand.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.647
[Javad] Do you recognize this woman?

37:13.231 --> 37:14.064
No.

37:14.065 --> 37:18.068
She's the one who found your phone
at Abbas's residence.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.111
That's her?

37:21.322 --> 37:25.826
I told you,
I didn't see anyone upstairs that night.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.622
[Javad] What about this man?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.167
No, I don't know him.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.713
You sure?

37:48.474 --> 37:50.476
[ominous music playing]

37:52.770 --> 37:53.688
[Noor exhaling]

37:58.901 --> 38:00.902
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.446
[Noor's breath shuddering]

38:03.030 --> 38:04.490
Tell me what?

38:05.950 --> 38:08.119
That man has been following me.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.329
I think he's a spy.

38:11.163 --> 38:12.164
American.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.751
For the past few weeks,

38:16.252 --> 38:21.716
he kept threatening me, pushing me
to give him files from our office.

38:23.384 --> 38:26.053
I kept telling him no,
but he wouldn't leave me alone.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.765
When I saw him at Abbas's party,

38:30.433 --> 38:32.643
I went upstairs to hide in the bathroom.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.563
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

38:36.480 --> 38:41.110
I thought if you saw him talking to me,
you'd get the wrong idea.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.031
I didn't want to get in trouble.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.399
[Noor's breath shuddering]

39:28.491 --> 39:30.409
What are you doing with the Americans?

39:31.202 --> 39:33.204
[sinister music playing]

39:41.921 --> 39:45.257
Lie to me again, and I promise...

39:47.134 --> 39:48.719
you will never see your mother.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.892
I went to them, not the other way around.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.018
[music fades]

39:57.019 --> 40:01.148
I offered to give them
Iranian intelligence.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.317
In exchange for what?

40:04.902 --> 40:05.736
Freedom.

40:08.447 --> 40:11.242
Asylum for me, my mother, and...

40:13.869 --> 40:16.539
Farhad died thanks to your treachery.

40:19.208 --> 40:23.212
Those American "saviors"
left him in the dirt.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.923
They left your mother, they left you,

40:26.924 --> 40:29.008
you filthy, lying bitch.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.095
- [Noor gasping]
- [sinister music playing]

40:34.348 --> 40:38.310
I let myself

40:39.145 --> 40:40.520
enjoy your company.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.605
[Noor gasping, shuddering]

40:42.606 --> 40:43.606
[Noor wincing]

40:43.607 --> 40:44.650
You know, I...

40:45.359 --> 40:46.193
Let go.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.654
I actually pictured
a future for us after New York.

40:49.655 --> 40:50.739
[Noor] Let go of me!

40:54.493 --> 40:56.370
Once I inform Abbas,

40:57.079 --> 40:59.290
you will be on the first flight home.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.632
[Noor shuddering]

41:09.508 --> 41:10.676
[Javad seething]

41:21.395 --> 41:24.523
You were afraid of the Iran you left.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.613
Imagine the Iran you will return to now.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.532
[sinister music swelling]

41:38.204 --> 41:39.205
Javad, wait.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.542
What if I could bring him to you?

41:45.085 --> 41:46.879
Peter. The American.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.678
[indistinct chatter]

41:59.642 --> 42:01.560
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

42:05.189 --> 42:06.482
[music fades]

42:13.697 --> 42:16.200
Excuse me. Where are they?

42:17.117 --> 42:18.284
The terrorists.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.078
Don't know, ma'am. We haven't caught them.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.581
So, what the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you in concealed positions?

42:23.582 --> 42:24.832
You didn't hear?

42:24.833 --> 42:25.751
Hear what?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.379
<i>Can I have some water, please?</i>

42:29.380 --> 42:30.923
[tense music playing]

42:42.268 --> 42:43.310
[Peter sighing]

42:48.399 --> 42:50.234
Is she okay with you coming in here?

[handcuffs clanking]

42:55.239 --> 42:56.824
[Solomon grunting]

42:59.868 --> 43:00.703
Please?

43:01.245 --> 43:02.745
Oh, sorry.

[Solomon gulping]

43:13.173 --> 43:14.216
[Solomon exhaling]

43:17.303 --> 43:20.389
[grunting] Your handler doesn't value you.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.600
When was the last time you got a raise?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.686
[tense music playing]

43:35.112 --> 43:36.780
[door creaking, closing]

43:37.406 --> 43:38.282
[lock clicking]

43:40.367 --> 43:42.286
[Solomon] You have a clear choice, Peter.

43:43.537 --> 43:46.081
<i>You wanna know
who's building a Foxglove weapon?</i>

43:46.957 --> 43:48.167
<i>Speak to my boss.</i>

43:49.293 --> 43:50.710
<i>He'll tell you everything.</i>

43:50.711 --> 43:52.254
[cell phone vibrating]

43:55.924 --> 43:58.051
- Hey. Did you get him?
- [Catherine] <i>No.</i>

43:58.052 --> 43:59.969
They have the hydrazine-BH.

43:59.970 --> 44:02.263
- What?
- [Catherine] <i>They hit this place earlier.</i>

44:02.264 --> 44:04.932
They must have two or more crews
boosting chemicals.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.225
They have everything they need?

44:06.226 --> 44:08.936
Mosley and I are headed back
to take another run at Solomon.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.272
You stay put.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.442
[suspenseful music swelling]

44:15.235 --> 44:16.069
[music fades]

44:16.070 --> 44:17.445
[Gloria] Hi there.

44:17.446 --> 44:20.531
My wife, Gloria, our daughter, Jesse.
This is Rose.

44:20.532 --> 44:21.616
Nice to meet you.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.743
Wil rarely brings home students.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.536
Your research must've impressed him.

44:25.537 --> 44:28.164
Well, his insights have been illuminating.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.125
Well, go ahead and take a seat.
Dinner's just about ready.

44:31.126 --> 44:33.628
I'm honestly not sure
I could eat much right now.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.046
Um, I might just head out.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.464
You sure?

44:36.465 --> 44:41.678
Yeah, I'm feeling a ton of pressure with
this, um, deadline hanging over my head.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.429
[Solomon] <i>You can stop all this.</i>

44:43.430 --> 44:46.141
<i>Just speak to my boss, one-on-one.</i>

44:47.309 --> 44:50.270
<i>I bet by now they got
all the chemical compounds, right?</i>

44:51.772 --> 44:53.107
<i>That isn't everything.</i>

44:56.235 --> 45:00.322
<i>Do you honestly think these people
can build a chemical weapon on their own?</i>

45:01.407 --> 45:03.992
<i>They're gonna need someone
to build it for them, won't they?</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:06.578
[tires screeching]

45:08.205 --> 45:09.330
We have to hide.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.040
- Sorry?
- We have to hide right now.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.625
There are men with guns outside.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.669
- What is that?
- Okay, quick. Come. Quickly.

45:14.670 --> 45:15.587
Hurry.

45:16.338 --> 45:17.380
Go, go, go.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.466
[suspenseful music playing]

45:26.390 --> 45:28.058

[Jesse screaming]

46:32.372 --> 46:34.750

- [Rose grunting]
- [man grunting]

47:06.865 --> 47:09.283
What the hell are you thinking?
We need the chemist.

47:09.284 --> 47:10.744
[Markus] He'll be all right.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.787
- No, Wil!
- Hey!

47:12.788 --> 47:14.790
- No.
- [Markus] Take them upstairs.

47:15.374 --> 47:16.958
You, go with them.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.794
[Jesse, Gloria breathing heavily]

47:19.419 --> 47:22.005
[Gloria] Go, go, go.
Just do what they say.

47:23.757 --> 47:24.758
Who the hell are you?

47:25.884 --> 47:28.135
I'm Dr. Cole's postdoc fellow.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.428
[Markus] Let's get rid of her.

47:29.429 --> 47:32.516
I... I know you're trying to build
a Foxglove weapon.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.309
That's why you need him, right?

47:35.227 --> 47:37.604
I've read all his notes.
They're right here.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.107
[ominous music playing]

47:41.567 --> 47:43.151
[Rose breathing heavily]

47:52.119 --> 47:55.079
You kill me, and you're royally screwed.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.415
Yeah? How's that?

47:56.915 --> 48:00.127
What if Dr. Cole has a concussion?
What if he bleeds out?

48:01.044 --> 48:04.339
How are you geniuses
gonna build a chemical weapon without him?

48:08.093 --> 48:09.010
You need me.

48:09.011 --> 48:11.096

48:20.230 --> 48:21.064
[latch clicking]

48:32.075 --> 48:33.784
[in Farsi] You said she would be here.

48:33.785 --> 48:36.622
- [in Farsi] She will be.
- [Azita] My daughter's never late.

48:37.289 --> 48:38.665
Did you get the right time?

48:39.541 --> 48:40.458
The right address?

48:40.459 --> 48:41.834
If she's smart,

48:41.835 --> 48:44.254
she'll be exercising
more caution than usual.

48:47.591 --> 48:50.468
- But does she know I'm here now?
- Of course.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.303
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.513
- Call her.
- I can't.

48:54.514 --> 48:56.223
[Azita] You've robbed me of one child.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.976
I won't let you rob me of the other.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.103
Give me the phone.
