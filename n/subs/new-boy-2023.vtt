03:53.033 --> 03:54.400
Police!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.467
Police coming through.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.867
Make way.

03:57.867 --> 04:00.700
Police! Coming through.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.800
Make way. Make way.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.633
Come on, make way.
Police business.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.000
Bugger!

05:41.133 --> 05:43.433
Is Dom Peter here?

05:44.433 --> 05:46.500
No, he's asleep.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.667
But he asked me to wait.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.367
I got a special
delivery for him.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.400
It's a little darkie.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.033
No, don't do that,
don't do that. He's a bolter!

06:06.667 --> 06:08.833
Hey! Get out of there.

06:08.833 --> 06:11.067
Little bugger,
come out of there.

06:11.067 --> 06:14.067
- Come out of there.
- Is that what we're doing?

06:14.067 --> 06:15.633
- Hey?!

06:15.633 --> 06:17.633
Is it? Come on!

06:17.633 --> 06:19.267
- What are you doing?
- Come on, I dare ya!

06:19.267 --> 06:21.300
Take the paperwork, will ya?

06:22.667 --> 06:24.067
Jesus!

06:24.067 --> 06:26.400
- What's his name?
- He hasn't got one.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.133
I'm Sister Eileen.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.233
Hey!

11:31.833 --> 11:33.800
-  What?
- You scared him.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.933
Oh.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.533
Here.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.367
What's your name?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.433
Hey.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.467
Look here, new kid.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.600
Ahh. Mm-mm.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.367
You want some?

12:20.533 --> 12:22.433
Come on.

12:22.433 --> 12:25.600
- He's not a joey.
- Hmm.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.967
Come here. Come on.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.133
Come on over.

12:44.533 --> 12:47.933
You like that?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.467
That's my marmalade.
Here, come here.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.800
Do...

12:59.800 --> 13:01.633
-  Want this, yeah?
-  Hey!

13:01.633 --> 13:03.633
He's from the desert, that kid.

13:07.933 --> 13:09.933
Go back to sleep.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.100
Hello. What's your name?

14:20.733 --> 14:22.567
Come on, out you come.

14:22.567 --> 14:23.900
You wanna meet everyone?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.433
Come on, come out.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.167
He's wearing a dress!

16:56.467 --> 16:58.567
Good morning, my son.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.267
Alright. Go on.
Go and join your brothers.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.767
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son,

17:17.767 --> 17:21.133
and to the Holy Ghost,
as it was in the beginning,

17:21.133 --> 17:25.300
is now and ever shall be,
world without end.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.767
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.267
Now, ah...

17:31.500 --> 17:36.300
...there's a new boy
who joined us last night.

17:36.300 --> 17:40.267
I'm sure you've all met him,
but I hope that you will

17:40.267 --> 17:44.367
show him the ways of our
little family and welcome him

17:44.367 --> 17:47.133
into, into the fold.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.333
Thank you, Sister.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.333
So,

17:58.333 --> 18:01.833
as one lamb arrives,

18:01.833 --> 18:03.433
another departs.

18:03.433 --> 18:06.600
And we are sad, today,
that our Johnny

18:06.600 --> 18:10.100
is leaving us
to begin a new journey.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.933
Come forward.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.633
That's right.

18:16.633 --> 18:19.033
Yep, you've got to bend over it.
That's right.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.467
Good boy.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.500
Dear Lord,

18:24.500 --> 18:27.467
I present this lost boy to you

18:27.467 --> 18:30.500
so that he may be baptised
and join your flock.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.533
May the water

18:34.533 --> 18:36.400
from your heart

18:36.400 --> 18:39.200
wash away all his sins.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.367
In the name of our Lord,
I baptise you... John.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.633
- Thank you, Sister.
- Okay.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.533
Now, will you all turn to

19:04.533 --> 19:07.567
your hymn books, page 62.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.167
"The Lord is my Shepherd."

19:18.933 --> 19:23.733
♪ The Lord's my Shepherd ♪

19:23.733 --> 19:26.800

20:29.700 --> 20:32.100
Come on, boys.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.233
Come on. Hep, hep.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.300
Come and get it, boys.

21:44.267 --> 21:46.967
I'm sad to see you leave, Johnny.

21:46.967 --> 21:49.200
You're a good boy.
You look after yourself.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
Thank you, Sister Mum.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.233
Know when to bite your tongue.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.400
Michael.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.533
Thank you, Sister Mum.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.733
Matthew.

22:01.933 --> 22:04.267
Thank you, Sister Mum.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.600
Steven.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.933
Thank you, Sister Mum.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.567
James.

22:10.567 --> 22:12.200
Thank you, Sister Mum.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.467
Henry.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.100
Thank you, Sister Mum.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.400
Ah, the little new one.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.633
Every kid here
calls me Sister Mum,

22:22.633 --> 22:24.300
'cause they don't have a mum.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.900
And if you ain't got one,

22:25.900 --> 22:28.367
you can call me
Sister Mum too, okay?

22:36.700 --> 22:38.733
Hmm.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.000
Alright, now George is here.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.233
John?

22:50.233 --> 22:52.933
Would you please
bless our meal one last time?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.633
Yes, Sister.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.000
Dear Lord,

23:06.000 --> 23:07.733
We ask you to bless this meal

23:07.733 --> 23:10.267
that Sister Mum
has prepared for us.

23:10.267 --> 23:13.033
For this food,
we give you thanks.

23:13.033 --> 23:17.267
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

23:29.467 --> 23:30.900
Grant us, O Lord,

23:30.900 --> 23:32.600
we beseech thee
a safe journey,

23:32.600 --> 23:35.433
so that under thy guidance and
the guidance of the holy angels,

23:35.433 --> 23:38.100
we may safely reach
our destination.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.633
St. Christopher, the
patron saint of travellers,

23:40.633 --> 23:43.100
pray for us,
and protect us from evil.

23:43.100 --> 23:46.467
In the name of the
Father and the Son...

23:46.467 --> 23:50.500
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and the Holy Spirit.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.300
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.067
Will you write to us, John?

24:04.333 --> 24:06.900
Look forward to hearing
of your progress.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.500
And these,
these are your papers.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.200
- Keep them safe, you hear?
- Yes, Sister.

24:13.367 --> 24:14.733
Ohh!

24:14.733 --> 24:16.867
Look, it's a miracle.

24:16.867 --> 24:18.367
It's a shilling.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.800
Just in case.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.633
Thank you, Sister.

24:24.733 --> 24:26.267
Be a good boy.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.233
Ah...

24:57.933 --> 25:01.167
Don't get too excited.
There's no knife in it.

25:15.967 --> 25:18.633
Bye, Johnny.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.733
Just don't worry, children.

25:49.733 --> 25:52.233
With Michael here,

25:52.233 --> 25:54.333
as our new head boy,

25:54.333 --> 25:57.867
you know we're going
to be in safe hands.

25:57.867 --> 26:01.767
Hey, Sister Mum,
might we have a cake tonight?

26:01.767 --> 26:05.633
In honour of Michael's big day.
What do you reckon, boys?

26:05.633 --> 26:09.600
- Rum and raisin? Eh?
-  Yes, please, Sister.

26:37.867 --> 26:39.633
Hurry up.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.167
Do your bed.

26:42.167 --> 26:45.000
And make sure you
do my bed as well.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.333
Okay.

27:06.067 --> 27:09.467
Ahh.
Morning, Dom Peter.

27:09.467 --> 27:12.067
It's a lovely day.

27:13.467 --> 27:17.367
Anyway, I told a lie
to a policeman.

27:18.167 --> 27:20.200
Well...

27:20.200 --> 27:22.800
...picked a fight, actually.

27:23.533 --> 27:24.967
And, um...

27:30.667 --> 27:32.733
Well, all the children are well.

27:32.733 --> 27:34.867
And as you can see,

27:34.867 --> 27:38.100
we got a new one
last night, so...

27:39.267 --> 27:40.567
Ahh...

27:40.567 --> 27:42.067
Yeah...

27:42.067 --> 27:44.400
Wow!

27:44.400 --> 27:48.833
What a difference
a year makes, hey?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.267
Anyway, um...

27:51.267 --> 27:53.633
Yeah, come on, son.
There's nothing to see here.

27:57.767 --> 28:00.833
Yeah,
and I baptised Johnny.

28:02.567 --> 28:05.600
I'm not sure if it worked,
I know it's a priest thing,

28:05.600 --> 28:07.900
not a nun thing.

28:11.833 --> 28:14.600
Oi! Careful!

28:19.200 --> 28:22.000
It's a year to the day,
you know?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.400
Since he died.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.800
Swearing at us
while we wiped his bum.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.433
Yeah. Well, we haven't been
struck down by lightning, yet.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.100
I think the Lord might be

28:33.100 --> 28:34.667
alright with our
little arrangement.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.733
- Hmm?
- They'll find out.

28:38.733 --> 28:41.133
We will be punished.

28:41.133 --> 28:43.367
- And they'll send another one.
- It doesn't matter to them.

28:43.367 --> 28:46.200
As long as we send
the profit from the harvest.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.600
The Lord will protect us, Sister.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.933
Where's that new boy gone?

28:53.000 --> 28:56.033
There he is.
Hugging a tree.

28:56.033 --> 28:59.067
Oi! Hey, cut it out.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.267
Come on. Come on.

29:03.267 --> 29:06.100
Now, you'll break your arm, eh?

30:15.167 --> 30:17.367
Go on.

30:17.367 --> 30:19.733
Go play with the other boys.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.767
"To the Chief Protector

30:32.767 --> 30:34.567
"of Aborigines, Mr Krank.

30:36.633 --> 30:40.667
"The boy John has been sent to
work on Dermott Downs Station.

30:42.267 --> 30:44.167
"While I appreciate that the war

30:44.167 --> 30:47.300
"has left many farms
light-handed,

30:47.300 --> 30:49.267
"the boy's education will suffer

30:49.267 --> 30:53.333
"as a result of this premature
induction into the workforce.

30:53.333 --> 30:58.000
"After all, John is
only a boy of 13.

31:02.433 --> 31:04.867
"I trust you will see
God's wisdom in this.

31:05.867 --> 31:08.400
"Yours sincerely,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.867
"Dom Peter."

32:18.700 --> 32:20.100
Sit back down.

32:58.133 --> 32:59.433
Uh-oh!

32:59.433 --> 33:01.667
George will have
something to say about that.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.633
Oi, darkie!

33:23.000 --> 33:25.800
Matthew says
he wants to fight you.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.467
Yeah, I'm going to
give it to you.

33:28.467 --> 33:31.067
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

33:31.067 --> 33:34.500
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

33:34.500 --> 33:37.267
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

33:38.600 --> 33:40.333
- You got him, Matty.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.033
Good morning, my sons!

34:37.033 --> 34:39.567
Ohhh. It's hot in here.

34:39.567 --> 34:41.300
Michael?

34:50.833 --> 34:53.033
What's going on here?

34:54.367 --> 34:55.500
Michael?

35:00.033 --> 35:02.333
Oh, come on.
He's so small, and he's not.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.767
Sister, last night,

35:03.767 --> 35:05.500
I caught Matthew here
stealing food.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.633
- And this was his punishment?
- No.

35:08.633 --> 35:10.167
No?

35:11.233 --> 35:12.700
Well...

35:12.700 --> 35:14.233
You're head boy, now.

35:14.233 --> 35:16.300
So what should
his punishment be?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.800
-  Caning.
-  Caning?

35:24.667 --> 35:27.800
We haven't caned a boy
in over a year.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.100
Is that what you really want?

35:35.833 --> 35:37.800
Michael, being head boy

35:37.800 --> 35:41.100
brings with it a
certain amount of power.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.667
But it will also
bring you challenges.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.700
It is times like this that the
Devil will test you, Michael.

35:46.700 --> 35:49.300
- You understand?
- Yes, Sister.

35:49.300 --> 35:50.633
Alright.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.900
I'll leave the decision
between you and God.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.200
-  Ow!

36:16.567 --> 36:18.167
Cut it out!

36:20.567 --> 36:23.100
Come on, that's enough.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.533
Now get ready for church.

36:25.533 --> 36:27.667
Go on, go wash up.

36:27.667 --> 36:29.467
Come on, go wash up.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.867
Matthew, come on.

36:33.867 --> 36:36.000
Matthew!

38:06.433 --> 38:09.467
Give us this day
our daily bread.

38:09.467 --> 38:10.967
And forgive us our trespasses,

38:10.967 --> 38:14.267
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

38:14.267 --> 38:18.400
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.733
Again.

38:19.733 --> 38:22.333
Our Father
who art in heaven,

38:22.333 --> 38:24.733
hallowed be thy name.

38:24.733 --> 38:26.100
Thy Kingdom come,

38:26.100 --> 38:29.933
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

38:29.933 --> 38:33.000
Give us this day
our daily bread.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.300
And forgive us our trespasses,

38:35.300 --> 38:38.800
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.033
And lead us not into temptation,

38:41.033 --> 38:42.567
but deliver us from evil.

38:42.567 --> 38:44.067
...deliver us from evil.

38:44.067 --> 38:46.100
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.500
Hey.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.500
Steven, he gets two scoops.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.033
- Oh! He gets two scoops.
- I know.

39:41.167 --> 39:43.133
So what happened this morning?

39:43.133 --> 39:45.967
Hmm? Oh.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.667
I think it's called
'the pecking order'.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.133
Ah, they'll sort it out.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.133
Now,

40:00.133 --> 40:02.233
as you know...

40:03.333 --> 40:08.400
...today is the first day
of the olive harvest.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.067
And George
will be here to help.

40:12.067 --> 40:13.833
Now,

40:13.833 --> 40:16.033
many of you were
here last year,

40:16.033 --> 40:20.133
so you're expected to teach
those children who weren't,

40:20.133 --> 40:22.567
how the harvest works.

40:24.867 --> 40:28.800
Now, in our little family,

40:28.800 --> 40:30.767
everyone contributes.

40:35.733 --> 40:38.167
When we take pride
in our work,

40:38.167 --> 40:41.133
we take pride in ourselves.

40:41.133 --> 40:43.400
- Good Lord.

40:44.867 --> 40:46.400
Mum!

40:47.333 --> 40:50.033
One, two, three...

40:56.233 --> 40:58.467
Oh, ow!

40:58.467 --> 41:00.667
It shouldn't sting
for too long.

41:43.967 --> 41:48.467
Pssss!

42:48.067 --> 42:50.533
Hey, you like that jam?

42:50.533 --> 42:52.233
That's my jam.

42:52.233 --> 42:53.633
George's jam.

43:01.233 --> 43:02.900
Good boy, Bear.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.233
Good boy, Bear.

43:08.633 --> 43:10.333
Good boy, Bear.

44:03.067 --> 44:05.533
Got a few bags, George?

44:06.567 --> 44:09.633
- Good start?
-  Yeah, good workers.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.967
How's
the new boy doing?

44:12.967 --> 44:15.200
Yeah,
he's doing alright.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.633
Good.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.367
Needs a name, though.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.300
You going to wet his head, too?

44:24.233 --> 44:26.200
We'll just call him
New Boy for now.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.000
You're the boss.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.433
Alright,
it's lunch, boys.

44:32.833 --> 44:34.600
Alright.

44:37.333 --> 44:39.333
Right, who'd like a sandwich?

44:40.267 --> 44:43.433
Michael, would you
hand out the sandwiches?

44:43.433 --> 44:44.767
Alright.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.233
Yes. Come on, Bear.

44:54.667 --> 44:56.533
"To Dom Peter.

44:56.533 --> 44:58.367
That's it.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.600
"He has been sent."

45:10.900 --> 45:13.433
Okay, men,
let's get to that rock wall.

45:14.633 --> 45:16.433
Come this way.
This way here.

45:26.467 --> 45:28.067
Hey.

45:29.133 --> 45:31.467
Go find the boys.

45:31.467 --> 45:33.367
You've got to pull your weight.

45:46.633 --> 45:49.633
"He has been sent.

45:49.633 --> 45:52.867
"We pray that this ghastly war
will soon end,

45:52.867 --> 45:56.400
"but until that day
he must remain in your care.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.133
"We trust, Dom Peter,
that you will guard him wisely,

46:00.133 --> 46:03.600
"as you guard the lost souls
under your charge."

46:27.933 --> 46:30.000
That's it.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.100
Come on, keep 'em coming.

46:35.100 --> 46:36.833
Rocks there.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.967
George, Michael fainted!

46:44.967 --> 46:46.433
Snake!

46:46.433 --> 46:49.633
- Hey? Where? Move, move!
- There!

46:52.633 --> 46:53.833
Kill it.

46:53.833 --> 46:55.667
Go get help. Go, go, go!

47:07.933 --> 47:09.133
Shit!

47:16.200 --> 47:18.800
Come on, boy.
Come on, boy. Come on!

47:18.800 --> 47:20.367
Come on, boy.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.667
Before
the snake told Eve

48:56.667 --> 48:58.267
to eat the forbidden fruit,

48:58.267 --> 49:00.633
they were oblivious to evil.

49:00.633 --> 49:02.967
They thought not bad thoughts

49:02.967 --> 49:05.367
and did not bad things.

49:05.367 --> 49:08.367
And they were naked
in their innocence.

49:11.567 --> 49:12.867
Whoa.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.300
Come on.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.233
Well, quit your gawking.

49:48.233 --> 49:50.667
Sister Eileen will put
the radio on for yas.

49:50.667 --> 49:53.600
Hmm, good idea, Sister.
Come on, boys.

51:06.500 --> 51:09.700
That's Mary,
that's me,

51:09.700 --> 51:11.367

There's a lot of work

53:23.933 --> 53:28.700
Now Michael will stay in bed.
Perhaps tomorrow he'll join us.

53:28.700 --> 53:30.700
Come on, wake up!

53:30.700 --> 53:33.667
Much to do. Much to do.

53:47.067 --> 53:50.500
Yeah, hold him up.
Keep him tight. Hold it!

54:49.867 --> 54:52.367
Over here! Over here!
Over here! He's over here!

54:52.367 --> 54:54.367
There's a big...
There's a big one in here!

54:55.800 --> 54:57.733
I've got it! I've got it!

54:57.733 --> 54:59.300
Come here!
You're not even looking!

55:01.833 --> 55:04.567
- Oh, wait, it ran away!
- He's just over there!

55:04.567 --> 55:06.933
He's over there! He's over
there! He's over there!

55:16.133 --> 55:17.500
Hmm.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.600
Look, Sister!

56:06.600 --> 56:08.733
George, stop.

56:08.733 --> 56:10.767
- Bear, whoa, Bear.
- Stop, stop!

56:51.933 --> 56:53.567
Hello!

57:00.467 --> 57:02.500
Hello!

57:02.500 --> 57:05.667
- Hello! Ah, my friend!
-  Ah, g'day.

57:05.667 --> 57:10.100
Oh! I see you have
our precious cargo.

57:10.100 --> 57:12.100
Yeah, I do, Sister.

57:12.100 --> 57:13.867
I just need a Dom Peter

57:13.867 --> 57:15.533
to be able to
sign for it, please.

57:15.533 --> 57:17.767
He's not here, he's...

57:17.767 --> 57:19.567
Um...

57:21.000 --> 57:22.300
Yeah, I'll sign.

57:22.300 --> 57:25.367
Ah, I'm afraid
it has to be Dom Peter

57:25.367 --> 57:27.167
that takes delivery
of the goods.

57:27.167 --> 57:30.133
Of course, of course.

57:32.100 --> 57:35.033
You know, when I said
Dom Peter wasn't here,

57:35.033 --> 57:37.267
I meant he's not 'all here'.

57:37.267 --> 57:38.900
Oh!

57:39.900 --> 57:41.133
Well...

57:48.167 --> 57:50.467
Wait, um...

57:50.467 --> 57:53.900
I'll see if I can...
I'll see if I can rouse him.

58:09.133 --> 58:10.367
Right.

58:13.100 --> 58:14.600
Yeah...

58:19.300 --> 58:21.800
Yeah, yeah, he...

58:22.733 --> 58:25.733
Is that a '38 or a '39?

58:25.733 --> 58:27.567
-  Mum!
-  Ah, it's a '39, mate.

58:27.567 --> 58:29.633
Sister Mum!

58:29.633 --> 58:30.867
Is it...

58:41.900 --> 58:44.233
Is it the old crank start?

58:44.233 --> 58:46.067
No, electric start.

58:46.067 --> 58:48.467
Tell you, mate,
there won't be any new models,

58:48.467 --> 58:50.100
not until after this war
is done, anyway.

58:50.100 --> 58:51.500
Yeah.

58:51.500 --> 58:53.267
- When's that going to be?
-  Who knows?

58:53.267 --> 58:55.267
Why did you wake me up?

58:55.267 --> 58:56.900
What do you want, you slut?

58:56.900 --> 58:58.267
Sign, just here!

58:58.267 --> 59:00.100
Get out of here,
you dirty slut.

59:00.100 --> 59:01.533
Sign!

59:01.533 --> 59:03.267
I'm not signing.
What's that?

59:03.267 --> 59:04.967
Ow! Get off me,
I'm not signing that, you slut.

59:04.967 --> 59:06.633
Oh!

59:06.633 --> 59:08.400
Go on, go on,
give me a kiss, you slut.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.067
Forgive me, Father.

59:10.067 --> 59:12.833
Come on, if
you're here, come and give me...

59:14.733 --> 59:17.933
Come here
with your paper, you whore.

59:17.933 --> 59:19.667
Just go and give me a kiss,
you slut.

59:21.367 --> 59:23.200
Hmm.

59:26.067 --> 59:28.000
He signed!

59:30.000 --> 59:32.433
-  Crazy, huh?
- He signed.

59:34.933 --> 59:36.767
Ah, okay.

59:36.767 --> 59:38.400
Sorry about the language.

59:38.400 --> 59:40.033
Yep, thank you.

59:40.033 --> 59:43.633
- He's not himself.
-  Okay, um...

59:45.633 --> 59:48.033
Do you want to give us
a hand with this, mate?

59:48.033 --> 59:49.167
Yes!

59:50.600 --> 59:52.467
Come on, boys.

59:52.467 --> 59:53.733
Come on!

59:53.733 --> 59:56.000
- Wait 'til I see something.
- Come on.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.867
Ow!

01:00:02.367 --> 01:00:04.600
Alright, that's it.
Chock him up.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.033
Alright, men,
get around to the front.

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:11.733
Sister, you sounded
just like Dom Peter.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.167
Oh, children,
you just heard some words

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:16.100
that you haven't heard
for quite some time.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.567
And I pray you'll never have
to hear them again.

01:00:18.567 --> 01:00:20.500
What is it, Sister?

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.833
It's a great
responsibility, Michael.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.267
- Quickly, come on.
-  Alright.

01:00:25.267 --> 01:00:26.933
Let's get it into the church.

01:00:26.933 --> 01:00:28.367
-  Alright, grab a side.
-  Okay.

01:00:28.367 --> 01:00:32.000
Right, grab a handle.
One, two, three!

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.900
Careful, boys.
Watch your fingers.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.667
Right.

01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:37.767
Slide him off.
Put him down there.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.533
Put him up. Good men. Good.

01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:50.100
Yeah.

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:58.200
Oh, blessed Father.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.333
He's travelled a long way.

01:01:12.333 --> 01:01:15.967
He had to be
hidden from some nasty people,

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:18.467
doing some nasty things.

01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:20.167
The Nazis?

01:01:20.167 --> 01:01:22.200
He's all that's good,

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.267
and all that's holy.

01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:27.000
And all that
they seek to destroy.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.267
Who, the nasties?

01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:33.200
Yes, Henry, the nasties.

01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:42.100
Now it's said

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.433
that he can perform miracles.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400

Keep away
from them, boys. Keep away.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.500
Get it out!

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.800
Go get it out of here!

01:11:07.867 --> 01:11:09.367
I said, get it out!

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.567
Oh, no, boys, come on.
Go and sit down.

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:20.267
Don't touch it.

Hey, Michael,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.200
Look after those
fires over there.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.367
Argh!

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.100
Come on.

01:25:09.233 --> 01:25:11.567
Ahh!

Tell me what to do.

01:27:50.567 --> 01:27:52.333
Oh, shit.

01:28:07.567 --> 01:28:09.400
Just cut it out.

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.767
Come on.

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:27.500
Careful.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.267
You might break him.

01:28:29.267 --> 01:28:31.033
I said cut it out!

01:28:33.067 --> 01:28:34.467
He's sacred!

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.067
I know what that kid is.

01:30:34.567 --> 01:30:36.233
Come on, men.

01:31:18.667 --> 01:31:20.067
Go home!

01:31:22.067 --> 01:31:23.933
Go on, get.

01:31:41.567 --> 01:31:44.400
...you were
raised from the dead.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.300
I receive Jesus Christ as my
Lord, sent for all our sins.

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.700
Dear God, I confess that I
have sinned and done wrong.

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.100
I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.667
took the punishment
I deserve

01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:57.767
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

01:31:57.767 --> 01:32:00.133
I also believe that you
raised him from the dead.

01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:03.367
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

01:32:03.367 --> 01:32:05.800
I believe that your son
Jesus Christ

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.533
took the punishment
I deserve

01:32:07.533 --> 01:32:09.400
and died on the cross
and I thank you.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.267
You raised him
from the dead.

01:32:11.267 --> 01:32:14.000
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.700
God! Dear God, I accept
I have sinned and done wrong.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.067
And I receive Jesus Christ
as my Lord and saviour.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.467
Dear God...

01:37:45.033 --> 01:37:46.267
Oh!

01:37:50.567 --> 01:37:52.267
Where is he?

01:37:52.267 --> 01:37:54.133
What have you done?

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:00.700
What have you done?

01:38:05.333 --> 01:38:06.467
Oh.

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.867
Amen.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.467
Why?

01:38:16.467 --> 01:38:19.833
Why would you do this to us?

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:39.767
Here he is.

01:38:53.533 --> 01:38:55.533
Thank you, Sister Mum.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.900
Thank you, Sister Mum.

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:28.267
Amen.

01:40:35.133 --> 01:40:36.900
Okay.

01:41:05.233 --> 01:41:08.400
Stupid, stupid girl.

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.900
He will not abandon you,

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.500
for he is your Father.

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.800
And as your Father,
he will protect you.

01:42:43.967 --> 01:42:46.300
For you are his sons.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.733
- He gave you life.

01:42:49.733 --> 01:42:52.467
So that you shall give
your life to him.

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.400
May your divine assistance
always be with us.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.200
And may the souls
of the faithfully departed...

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.633
Sister!

01:43:27.633 --> 01:43:29.900
...with the mercy of God...

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.867
...rest in peace.

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:36.700
Amen.

01:43:47.667 --> 01:43:49.333
Son?

01:43:57.967 --> 01:43:59.400
Dear Lord,

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.067
I present this lost boy to you

01:44:02.067 --> 01:44:04.100
so that he may be baptised,

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:06.000
and join your flock.

01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:16.733
May this water

01:44:16.733 --> 01:44:18.967
from your heart

01:44:18.967 --> 01:44:21.133
wash away all his sins.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.033
After his resurrection,

01:44:35.033 --> 01:44:37.500
Jesus told his disciples,

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.933
"Go forth.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.933
"Teach all nations."

01:44:46.133 --> 01:44:47.567
"Baptise them."

01:45:27.133 --> 01:45:29.367
I baptise thee,

01:45:29.367 --> 01:45:31.200

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.533
I made you these.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.000
Yeah.

"Today,

Turn it around.

Alright, okay, men.

01:50:14.933 --> 01:50:17.433
Go on. Go and turn around now.

01:50:17.433 --> 01:50:19.033
Turn around. Come back.
