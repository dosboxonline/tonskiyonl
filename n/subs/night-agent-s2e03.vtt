00:09.384 --> 00:10.801
- [gun firing]
- [both yelling]

00:10.802 --> 00:13.470
That guy that shot at us tonight
killed my partner.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.055
- [gun firing]
- [Alice grunting]

00:15.056 --> 00:18.350
[Peter] I don't know if Catherine's
involved, if Night Action is compromised.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.436
I cannot trust anyone.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.812
Except me, right?

00:21.813 --> 00:24.940
You said the CIA
would grant me and my family asylum

00:24.941 --> 00:26.400
if I gave you intelligence.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.235
This is worthless.
I can't do anything with this.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.612
[Haleh in Farsi] I saw Javad noticing you.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.408
- [in Farsi] I don't know him.
- So get to know him.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.452
Warren Stocker.
He's the key to all of this.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.912
Tell me anything you know
about where Warren might be going.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.165
Maybe seeing where he's been
will tell us where he's going.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.834
[Ethan] What are you doing with my dad?

00:43.376 --> 00:45.586
I'm gonna fly back to California.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.714
Good. Get the night bus out of Chinatown.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.383
Bangkok. What intel were you selling?

00:51.384 --> 00:54.178
It was called Foxglove.
It dealt with experimental--

00:54.179 --> 00:55.180
[gun firing]

00:57.057 --> 00:58.183
[cell phone ringing]

01:03.772 --> 01:04.605
Hello?

01:04.606 --> 01:05.774
[music fades]

01:07.734 --> 01:09.736
[opening theme music playing]

01:15.867 --> 01:19.328
[man] Is it chill to reject someone
for being too qualified for a job?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.454
[Rose chuckling lightly]

01:20.455 --> 01:22.873
[man] The fact that you're even here
is a little sus.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.708
That's very kind, but I'm--

01:24.709 --> 01:29.254
Serious though. Lead programmer pay
doesn't come close to CEO salary.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.090
I'm not looking for more money.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.175
[man] It's a lot less responsibility.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.053
You've hired people for this position.
It's a grind.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.264
Honestly, that sounds perfect right now.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.599
I wasn't cut out to be a CEO.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.228
You seem to take to it,
but I just wanna write code.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.562
And I'm good.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.066
Hire me and my skills are all yours,
no questions asked.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.569
AdVerse is my baby. My code.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.488
[Rose] I know.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.824
When can I start?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.286
[opening theme music playing]

02:05.291 --> 02:06.500
[indistinct chatter]

02:06.501 --> 02:08.669
All aboard for Boston South Station.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.672
Anything bigger than a backpack's
gotta be stowed below.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.756
Tickets out, please.

02:12.757 --> 02:13.882
[Peter panting]

02:13.883 --> 02:15.050
Hello?

02:15.051 --> 02:18.387
[man] <i>Peter Sutherland. Finally.
You're a hard man to track down.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:19.346
Who is this?

02:19.347 --> 02:20.305
[man] <i>Immaterial.</i>

02:20.306 --> 02:21.975
I've called to cut a deal.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.892
Open the door,

02:23.893 --> 02:27.813
tell my men what Warren said to you
and who've you told about all this.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.857
Why, so they can put a bullet in my head?

02:29.858 --> 02:33.235
- [man] <i>Something like that, yes.</i>
- Why would I accept that shitty deal?

02:33.236 --> 02:36.822
'Cause then Rose Larkin
would make it safely to Boston on her bus.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.323
[tense music playing]

02:38.324 --> 02:40.868
She... She doesn't know anything.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
[man] <i>Also immaterial.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:46.874
Why are you doing this?
How am I a threat to you?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.042
Work the problem, Peter.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.879
[Peter] <i>I don't even know who you are.</i>

02:51.379 --> 02:52.714
Work the problem.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.177
Wait, you're, uh...
You're the man from the bus stop.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.387
<i>In Bangkok.</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:02.848
<i>You're Warren's buyer.
You have the intel he stole.</i>

03:02.849 --> 03:03.766
And what?

03:05.935 --> 03:06.936
I can ID you.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.646
Nicely done.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.523
I'd assume a smart man like you

03:11.524 --> 03:14.152
would jump at the chance
to save sweet Rose's life.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.695
- If you hurt her--
- [man] <i>Then you'll kill me.</i>

03:16.696 --> 03:19.657
Yes, I... I understand.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.328
<i>Bangkok was unfortunate.</i>

03:24.245 --> 03:25.621
I don't wanna repeat the past,

03:25.622 --> 03:31.793
but I will have Rose killed
in your place if I have to.

03:31.794 --> 03:35.047
- You'll kill her no matter what I do.
- [man] <i>No, I won't. I promise.</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:37.383
And I'm a man who keeps my promises.

03:41.095 --> 03:41.971
Fuck you.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.326
- [Peter] <i>Rose?</i>
- Peter?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.662
- Where are you?
- [Rose] <i>I'm in Chinatown.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:07.579
On the bus?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.123
I'm standing in line to board.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.124
Hide. Right now.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.294
<i>- They're coming after you.</i>
- Who is?

04:16.381 --> 04:19.258
It's the man from last night.
The guy who shot at us.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
- There's three of them.
- [Peter] <i>Run!</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:30.227
[man] She got through. She got through.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.021
- Go get her. Go get her.
- [man 2] Move! Move!

Hey, Rose. Are you there?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.442
Uh, I got away, but they're following.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.985
[Peter] <i>What stores are nearby?</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:22.154
Um, tarot place, restaurant...

05:22.155 --> 05:23.238
Go in the restaurant.

[doorbell chiming]

05:33.166 --> 05:35.042
Okay, I'm in. But one of them's behind me.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.544
[Peter] <i>Hide in the kitchen.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:38.670
[all gasping]

05:38.671 --> 05:39.630
Come on!

05:41.132 --> 05:42.216
Come on!

05:42.967 --> 05:45.636
- Nowhere to hide.
- [Peter] <i>Grab a knife, find an exit.</i>

- Rose, what's happening? You good?
- [Rose] <i>Are you? What was that?</i>

06:43.528 --> 06:45.238
[Peter] I'm fine. Where are you?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.448
Um, I'm outside, but they're close.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.283
[Peter] <i>Describe your surroundings.</i>

06:50.284 --> 06:53.328
Uh, there's shops,
uh, tourists, tacky T-shirts.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.497
[Peter] <i>Change up your look.</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:10.930
You go that way.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.105
[Rose] <i>I think I lost them.</i>

07:20.106 --> 07:21.189
[indistinct chatter]

07:21.190 --> 07:22.567
Shit. Oh God!

- Yell for help!
- [Rose shrieking] Help! Help!

07:59.437 --> 08:00.729
Be quiet!

08:00.730 --> 08:01.980
[shushing]

08:01.981 --> 08:02.939
Fight him, Rose!

[knife clattering]

08:30.051 --> 08:30.885
I'm okay.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.386
I... I got away, but he's following me.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.304
[Rose yelling]

08:34.305 --> 08:36.515
Rose? Rose!

[phone line ringing]

09:51.799 --> 09:52.800
[phone chiming]

09:55.553 --> 09:56.470
That Peter?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.895
[music fades]

10:05.896 --> 10:09.025
I have trained agents hunting him,
and you found him.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.817
He contacted you.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.236
- No.
- [Catherine] Then how?

10:13.112 --> 10:15.196
- You need to take me to him.
- Why should I do that?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.699
Enough bullshit.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.077
I have an agent in the field
who is either misinformed

10:21.078 --> 10:23.121
or off the deep end.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.666
Peter doesn't have half the experience
I expect from my most junior agents,

10:26.667 --> 10:28.544
so I am worried about him too.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.672
Tell me how he is.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.133
I think he's been alone too long.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.301
Then let me help him.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.387
[dramatic music playing]

10:39.889 --> 10:41.848
He'll be at Brooklyn Bridge Park.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.849
[siren wailing]

10:42.850 --> 10:43.768
Thank you.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.353
[car alarm chirping]

10:46.896 --> 10:50.524
I'll have a Secret Service detail
take you back to California tomorrow.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.444
I've had protection detail before.
It didn't turn out so hot.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.905
- This time will be different.
- Peter won't go for it.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.324
[Catherine] It's not his call.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.701
He chose Night Action, not you.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.162
Do not put your life at risk.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.585
I'll go home, but let me tell him first.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.966
[tense music playing]

11:21.013 --> 11:22.931
- Hey.
- [Rose] Hey.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.973
[Peter] Hey, you okay?

11:23.974 --> 11:25.392
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.562
Is this what it's come to
after nine months of trust?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.524
Catherine saved me tonight.
Maybe hear her out.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.734
How'd you find her?

11:34.735 --> 11:36.111
Warren's kid went missing.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.824
I sat on his ex-wife's place,
saw Rose bring him home,

11:40.324 --> 11:43.035
followed her to Chinatown,
hoping to find you.

11:43.619 --> 11:47.123
But instead, happened upon
this unpleasant fella. Who is he?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
He's the one that killed Alice.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.796
If it wasn't you who tipped them off,
how'd they ambush us?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.716
- Who else knew about the CIA leak?
- I didn't have anything to do with this.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.509
- Prove it.
- I can't prove a negative.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.969
Bangkok was a shitshow.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.431
And I don't have to explain anything.
You work for me.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.641
I don't work for anyone I don't trust.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.351
I've done that before.
I'm not doing it again.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.521
Well, then you picked
the wrong profession.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.106
And how am I expected to what, just ignore

12:13.107 --> 12:17.360
that you and Warren Stocker went dark
after Alice's death?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.821
I didn't have anything to do
with Alice's death.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.073
And you can prove that?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.910
Forget it.
I'm gonna figure this out myself.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.746
- Come on.
- This isn't how Night Action works.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.831
I'm pulling you out.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.460
Maybe she can help. She helped me.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.469
I saw Warren's buyer in Bangkok.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.304
I didn't know it was him until tonight.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.806
He has the leaked intel.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.977
I'm the only one
who's seen the target, Catherine.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.311
You need me.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.230
I need more than that
after what happened in Bangkok.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.733
- With Alice?
- [Catherine] Yes.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.152
Since he won't tell you, I will.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.614
Alice was his partner, his training agent,
and she was killed.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.159
And Peter still has yet to tell me how.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.122
We split up.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.460
She went after him,
and I stuck with Warren.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.921
When he dropped the flash drive,
there was this guy there.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.006
He was watching us, and he didn't fit in.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.550
Now, he called me tonight.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.469
And I'd know more, but, uh...

13:24.470 --> 13:25.303
he shot Warren.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.305
What? When?

13:27.306 --> 13:30.434
About an hour ago.
And then they sent their guys after Rose.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.895
Did Warren give you anything
before he was shot?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.022
No, no.

13:36.732 --> 13:40.026
Now, you can pull me off this,
but he knows I can ID him.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.154
And he knows that Rose is important to me.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.033
Which means I need to find him
before he finds us.

13:52.915 --> 13:53.749
Fine.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.292
Let's negotiate
the length of your new leash.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.462
The FBI is running this image.

13:59.046 --> 14:03.383
Our initial search returned a number
of partial matches, no exact ID.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.677
I'll send you a complete file by morning.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.764
Confirm his name and tell me
who the buyer is that he works for.

14:09.765 --> 14:10.808
Do your job,

14:11.517 --> 14:15.229
or I swear to God, I'll send you
straight back to the White House basement.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.857
I'll finish this.

14:18.983 --> 14:19.859
Good choice.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.611
Look after Rose until I can figure out
what to do with her.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.989
Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

14:25.990 --> 14:26.948
I'm fine.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.742
[siren wailing in distance]

14:30.619 --> 14:32.705
- What?
- I ran out of money.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.629
This will buy you a few days.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.009
My van's compromised.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.766
[keys jangling]

14:55.436 --> 14:56.520
Don't scratch it.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.024
Come on.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.277
[suspenseful music playing]

15:17.416 --> 15:18.459
[knocking on door]

15:19.043 --> 15:20.169
[music fades]

15:22.880 --> 15:24.381
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:24.882 --> 15:29.094
Please, uh, don't lose that sweatshirt.
I only have, like, three of them.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.388
[Rose] Really needs a wash.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.765
Sorry it took me so long.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.851
I had to park Catherine's car,
like, a borough away,

15:36.852 --> 15:40.940
just in case she tagged it,
but I got pizza on the walk back.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.524
Thanks.

15:43.150 --> 15:43.984
Yeah.

15:49.990 --> 15:50.824
What's that?

15:51.825 --> 15:56.329
This is, um...
This is Warren's confession before he, uh...

15:56.330 --> 15:57.830
You lied to Catherine?

15:57.831 --> 16:01.669
I can't trust Night Action, okay?
Till I know Catherine didn't sell us out.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.797
[car horn honking in distance]

16:06.882 --> 16:10.052
Peter, not everyone's Diane Farr.

16:12.054 --> 16:16.182
The man who called you, did he sound
American, educated, a little smug?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.351
Yeah. Why?

16:17.851 --> 16:20.854
He called me in California,
asking if you were okay.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.024
I think he used me to find you.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.736
I'm sorry.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.115
- I didn't mean for--
- I'm going back to California.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.993
Catherine offered me protection,
and I'm gonna take it.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.996
I have a job there, a life.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.539
You and I already agreed
that I should leave.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.376
Yeah, I know, but that was before
you were being hunted.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.212
[suspenseful sting playing]

16:46.046 --> 16:47.714
[Noor in Farsi] It tastes wonderful.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.674
[in Farsi] Haleh says
there's too much rose.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.634
[in Farsi] Any rose is too much rose.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.178
Haleh's forgotten the taste of home.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.806
[in English] Gone full American.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.809
[in Farsi] Just leave me here
when you go back.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.186
You take Noor, I'll stay with Javad.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.104
[man] Yeah?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.940
[in Farsi] He's not interested
in an old married lady like you.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.817
If he liked you,
he would've walked you home.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.777
Javad was just being kind.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.990
Well, then kindly ask him out on a date
so the four of us can double!

17:13.490 --> 17:14.449
[Noor inhaling]

17:14.450 --> 17:16.701
[in Farsi] He already asked me to lunch.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.702
I knew it.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.619
[all chuckling]

17:18.620 --> 17:21.331
I said no. It's too quick!

17:21.915 --> 17:24.168
I go from work to work.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.754
And we can't step out while Abbas is in.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.381
Love finds a way.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.425
[both chuckling]

17:31.967 --> 17:33.176
Bijan is right.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.596
Find the moment and I'll cover for you.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.515
Well, I did look at Abbas's schedule.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.976
It is unclear if he is out
for some meeting tomorrow.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.728
[Haleh] Yes, from one to three.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.812
What for?

17:44.813 --> 17:46.606
Who knows, he scheduled it himself.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.775
Ah, but he's asking for Javad
to escort him tomorrow.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.111
So not the time for romance, <i>azizam</i>.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.113
But don't miss your chance.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.532
[Noor chuckling]

[Rose sobbing loudly]

18:07.628 --> 18:08.879
[Rose screaming]

18:10.547 --> 18:11.590
Hey. Rose.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.759
Hey, it's me. It's Peter.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.176
You okay?

18:15.177 --> 18:17.262
[Rose sobbing]

18:18.889 --> 18:20.808
You're safe. You're okay, you're okay.

18:22.976 --> 18:23.894
[Rose sniffling]

18:24.978 --> 18:26.979
[train rattling]

18:26.980 --> 18:29.066
[somber music playing]

18:34.863 --> 18:37.032
[in Farsi] One sip and I'm up all night.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.785
- Good morning, Javad.
- [in Farsi] Morning.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.661
See you at the office.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.122
[music fades]

[fridge door opening]

18:55.384 --> 18:56.927
[objects clattering]

18:58.178 --> 19:00.305
[in Farsi] I spoke to my family
last night.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.183
What news from Isfahan?

19:04.393 --> 19:08.147
Come to lunch with me,
and I'll tell you all Mom had to report.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.525
[contemplative music playing]

19:12.276 --> 19:14.611
You changed your mind?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.740
I would love to.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.744
But I have business with Abbas
over the lunch hour.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.371
Oh, that's disappointing.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.415
But tomorrow?

19:26.915 --> 19:27.916
I can't tomorrow.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.336
With Abbas's party
and General Assembly prep...

19:32.337 --> 19:33.964
Busy time.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.716
[Javad] For us all.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.595
But I could at least

19:40.387 --> 19:41.847
accompany you home again.

19:44.016 --> 19:44.892
You know,

19:45.642 --> 19:49.313
I know the best
Persian restaurants in town.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.024
Where are you taking Abbas?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.735
We could meet up.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.988
Not while I'm working.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.701
I could work through lunch.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.288
And we could eat later when you're back.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.999
You would wait for me?

20:10.042 --> 20:10.959
[Noor chuckling]

20:12.336 --> 20:13.712
It's a date then.

[music fades]

20:36.568 --> 20:37.945
Morning. [inhaling]

20:38.487 --> 20:39.570
Good morning.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.114
[train rattling]

20:42.115 --> 20:42.950
Bad dream?

20:45.118 --> 20:45.994
Nightmare.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.332
Post-traumatic stress,
if Gretchen is to be believed.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.167
Who's Gretchen?

20:53.168 --> 20:54.378
My therapist.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.840
I started seeing her
after everything we went through.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.220
I'm glad you're talking
to somebody about it.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.306
I didn't really talk about it.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.228
Um, I didn't want to relive all of that.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.107
No one could understand
what we went through.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.734
Except you. [sighing]

21:19.945 --> 21:25.450
Therapy has helped me manage
my nightmares, until last night.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.706
I still dream about Alice dying.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.589
What was she like?

21:41.508 --> 21:43.426
She liked dirty jokes.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.346
You know, she liked grilled cheese.
She was just, um...

21:47.806 --> 21:48.890
She was normal.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.559
Yeah. [chuckling]

21:51.852 --> 21:53.437
Think you guys would've liked each other.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.984
That guy that attacked you...

22:00.902 --> 22:02.654
he's the one who murdered her.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.407
And, um...

22:06.491 --> 22:07.326
I--

22:09.786 --> 22:10.912
I couldn't stop it.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.008
You're gonna be all right, Rose. Okay?

22:24.926 --> 22:26.636
You're gonna be fine. You're a fighter.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.806
What if I run out of fight?

22:37.105 --> 22:42.110
I want you to, um, take Catherine up
on her protection offer, okay?

22:44.488 --> 22:45.697
You need to go home.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.951
Anywhere's safer than here with me.

Hi.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.753
[music fades]

Uh...

23:04.383 --> 23:05.217
[man sighing]

23:05.926 --> 23:07.344
I keep misplacing my keys.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.597
My friend suggested a tag or something.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.807
[man exhaling]

23:12.808 --> 23:14.226
- [tag clattering]
- [finger tapping]

23:16.728 --> 23:17.562
Can I ask,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.524
what is the tracking range on this?

23:21.942 --> 23:23.110
[man sighing]

23:23.610 --> 23:25.112
[drawer sliding]

23:25.946 --> 23:28.865
[man] Satellite connected,
good battery, comes with an app.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.787
Great for keys, dogs,
even cheating boyfriends.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.281
Home delivery, lucky me!

24:10.157 --> 24:13.159
Good timing, I'm just leaving.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.036
[in Farsi] Here. It's a bit brisk out.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.082
Very thoughtful, Noor.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.208
I'm sorry. Miss Taheri.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.377
Please, call me Noor.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.588
Thank you, Noor.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.841
Wish my Shirin had turned out like you.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.927
But unfortunately, my daughter's willful.

24:31.845 --> 24:36.474
Never showed Baba the respect he is due.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.685
[Noor] I was a holy terror at her age.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.730
That photo is decades old.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.524
Are you two still close?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.320
Thank you for your help, Ms. Taheri.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.490
Put the rest in the closet.
The study door will close behind you.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.492
Of course.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.371
[Peter] He's been using
different identities for years.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.748
Warren called him Arthur.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.418
But if he gave him that name,
it's definitely an alias.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.505
You don't have to help me, Rose.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.756
Well, I found you when no one else could.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.927
And I'm the only one with access
to a proprietary search engine.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.181
Besides, I would rather help you than sit
around all day just waiting to go home.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.518
[keyboard clacking]

25:20.519 --> 25:24.063
Okay, his real identity should exist
online before any of the fake ones.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.981
So, what, we just look at older results?

25:25.982 --> 25:29.276
I can narrow the search
to exclude all of these names.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.863
Only return hits
from before any of them existed.

25:33.532 --> 25:38.077
This marketing protocol could be
kind of dangerous in the wrong hands.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.954
I mean, this isn't really AdVerse.

25:39.955 --> 25:43.290
The base code is, but I added
all the location-tracking stuff.

25:43.291 --> 25:47.546
- Artoun would never use it like this.
- You ever think about running the NSA?

25:48.838 --> 25:50.005
[Rose chuckling]

25:50.006 --> 25:52.092
[suspenseful music playing]

25:52.801 --> 25:55.554
Head through the intersection
and slow down.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.892
I think we're here.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.985
[inaudible]

26:18.285 --> 26:20.078
Up here is fine. Please.

26:34.884 --> 26:35.885
[doorbell chiming]

26:43.184 --> 26:44.978
[man chuckling] Terrible.

26:45.645 --> 26:49.315
- Excuse me. Another one, please.
- Tomás, no. I must get back.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.109
The foreign secretary can't find a loo
without me by his side.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.862
That's not very diplomatic of you,
turn down a drink from an ally.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.866
Shagging the same birds at Oxford
a lifetime ago doesn't make us allies.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.036
I'd have thought "brothers" more accurate.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.703
It wasn't that long ago.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.580
- [bartender] There you go.
- Thanks.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.082
[classical piano music playing]

27:07.083 --> 27:10.252
Elliot, I'm sorry to ask again.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.087
Then don't. My answer can't change.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.131
But my nation needs a leader.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.132
They have one.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.760
A puppet regime.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.720
Babysitting until
the UN Security Council votes

27:19.721 --> 27:22.849
on how to carve up my family's dominion.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.142
My father rots in The Hague

27:25.143 --> 27:27.686
while he could be
bringing stability to the region.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.856
Your foreign secretary must see that.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.108
If you just ask him to meet with me,
I know he'd be open--

27:33.109 --> 27:36.320
The secretary's role
is to protect British interests,

27:36.321 --> 27:39.032
not appeal to the International Court
on behalf of a...

27:39.741 --> 27:41.909
I'm sorry, dangerous war criminal.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.036
The situation is much more complex.
The Americans--

27:44.037 --> 27:46.915
Stop. I won't listen
to your baseless accusations again.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.626
And I shan't risk my career
for your asshole father.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.419
[indistinct chatter]

27:52.420 --> 27:57.133
Take his money, buy a yacht,
screw Sloane up and down the Amalfi Coast.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.637
It's time to be your own man, Tomás.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.306
Elliot Cooke, you lush!

28:04.307 --> 28:05.225
[both chuckling]

28:05.809 --> 28:08.268
It's just gone noon
and you're plastered. Naughty.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.770
Blame your boyfriend.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.814
I keep protesting, he keeps buying.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.899
Well, yes, he is generous that way.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.277
I'm off. Lovely to see you, Sloane.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.242
[Sloane] Oh, now.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.744
Elliot's always been a coward.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.540
Why don't you come upstairs, darling?

28:29.332 --> 28:31.750
And I'll show off what I bought.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.211
- [Tomás] Hmm.
- Come on.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.963
I'll be right up.

28:37.882 --> 28:38.799
[chuckling softly]

28:38.800 --> 28:41.094
[unsettling music playing]

28:42.971 --> 28:44.848
[suspenseful music playing]

28:49.853 --> 28:51.104
[camera shutter clicking]

28:55.859 --> 28:57.192
[door closing in distance]

28:57.193 --> 28:58.987
[music fades]

28:59.571 --> 29:00.571
[keyboard clacking]

29:00.572 --> 29:01.947
[Peter] Here you go. [exhaling]

29:01.948 --> 29:02.866
Thanks.

29:04.784 --> 29:05.868
We only got one hit?

29:05.869 --> 29:08.912
A newspaper scan from six years ago.

29:08.913 --> 29:12.125
It's an obituary for a deceased Marine
named Solomon Vega.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.211
Says he's survived by his sister, Celeste.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.299
We do not have
a Solomon Vega on the list, so...

29:19.883 --> 29:23.302
Shouldn't the FBI or the DOD have
some sort of record of a former Marine?

29:23.303 --> 29:26.473
Not if someone higher up wiped his file.
Is there anything else on there?

29:28.391 --> 29:30.976
Uh, that shouldn't happen. Sorry.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.479
[keyboard clacking]

29:35.815 --> 29:37.441
- Um...
- [cell phone vibrating]

29:37.442 --> 29:40.319
Shit. Uh, just give me a sec.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.237
Yeah.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.448
Hey, Artoun, I meant to call.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.284
[Artoun] <i>What the hell did you do
to my code?</i>

29:46.868 --> 29:50.245
<i>I can see you've been active,
but all your past queries were deleted.</i>

29:50.246 --> 29:53.540
And who's this dude you're searching for?
Did Adrien put you up to this?

29:53.541 --> 29:55.292
The VC guy? No, of course not.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.835
[Artoun] <i>He said look for other uses,</i>

29:56.836 --> 30:00.422
and I catch you using AdVerse
to, what, stalk people?

30:00.423 --> 30:02.674
Are you making a fucking investor play
behind my back?

30:02.675 --> 30:04.802
No, no, no. Uh, it's just my mom.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.178
She's off the grid again,

30:06.179 --> 30:09.640
and I thought that I could use
AdVerse's raw data to search for her,

30:09.641 --> 30:10.849
and then maybe I could--

30:10.850 --> 30:12.810
I've revoked your access to AdVerse.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.063
Get your ass back to California.
We'll talk about if you still have a job.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.189
Understood.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.650
Um, see you soon.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.533
[somber music playing]

30:27.116 --> 30:28.159
Hey.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.831
Got an address for Solomon's sister.
You wanna take a ride?

30:33.915 --> 30:34.957
Yeah.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.043

[doorbell chiming]

31:03.152 --> 31:03.987
[door closing]

31:04.904 --> 31:06.363
No, I don't really get it,

31:06.364 --> 31:10.450
because, you know, all she does
is send me these videos of these cats.

31:10.451 --> 31:13.746
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. [laughing]

31:21.838 --> 31:22.672
[Noor gasping]

31:54.037 --> 31:55.538
[car engine starting]

31:58.291 --> 31:59.751
Is everything okay at work?

32:00.335 --> 32:01.210
Yeah, it's fine.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.922
You never answered me before,

32:04.714 --> 32:06.507
about you not starting your own thing.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.884
I remember you having
some really good ideas.

32:08.885 --> 32:12.555
Yeah, well, with my track record,
investors weren't all that interested.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.182
I did have one shot early on,

32:15.183 --> 32:18.186
but I had a panic attack
and blew the meeting, so...

32:19.646 --> 32:22.272
Shit, I'm sorry, Rose. That sucks.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.400
It's okay. Everything worked out.

32:24.901 --> 32:25.776
I'm just...

32:25.777 --> 32:27.527
A cog in the machine?

32:27.528 --> 32:29.238
Lead programmer, thank you.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.241
For what it's worth,
I think your version of AdVerse is...

32:33.242 --> 32:34.202
It's pretty cool.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.454
And hopefully your boss sees that.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.747
I just need to get back to the old me,

32:38.748 --> 32:40.875
figure out what's next,
get my head straight.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.669
You'll get there.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.503
Well, thanks, coach.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.796
[Peter chuckling]

32:45.797 --> 32:46.922
[tense music playing]

32:46.923 --> 32:49.049
Hi. Did you get the photos?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.218
[man] <i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

32:50.718 --> 32:52.844
Do you recognize him? Is he important?

32:52.845 --> 32:54.346
Well, I've never seen the man,

32:54.347 --> 32:56.932
and I didn't know what to make
of the other pictures.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.266
The briefcase.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.602
The man entered with it,
and Abbas left with it.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.563
[man] <i>Do you know what was exchanged?</i>

33:03.106 --> 33:05.315
No. I... I thought the photos would be--

33:05.316 --> 33:07.317
They're meaningless. It's an unknown man.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.320
It's a nondescript bag
with Lord knows what inside of it.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.030
Is this like a joke to you?

33:12.031 --> 33:13.073
No, no, no, no, no.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.867
I... I need to get my family out of Iran.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.411
You have to help us, please.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.330
[man] <i>You're not in a position
to bring us anything of substance.</i>

33:20.331 --> 33:23.834
So why don't you just throw the phone away

33:23.835 --> 33:26.336
and forget we ever met
before you get yourself hurt?

33:26.337 --> 33:29.215
What if I find out what Abbas has?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.758
<i>What is inside the briefcase?</i>

33:31.759 --> 33:34.136
I don't recommend that you do that.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.220
[Noor] <i>What if I found it,</i>

33:35.221 --> 33:38.515
and I took pictures,
and that information was valuable?

33:38.516 --> 33:39.641
[man sighing]

33:39.642 --> 33:42.728
If you got something
you'd like me to see, I will look,

33:42.729 --> 33:45.355
but I'm not telling you to do anything.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.900
In fact, I strongly suggest
that you don't.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.820
- Good luck.
- Oh, thanks.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.196

34:04.250 --> 34:07.128
[in Farsi] Haleh, hold my calls for now.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.592
[in Farsi] Let me do that.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.678
[suspenseful music playing]

34:39.619 --> 34:41.120
[Javad in Farsi] Still hungry?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.663
[Noor breathing deeply]

34:43.664 --> 34:44.957
- Hello.
- Hello.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.210
Yes, very.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.545
You head out, I'll follow.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.255
Sure.

35:13.861 --> 35:14.821
[knocking on door]

35:15.321 --> 35:16.404

[dog barking]

35:21.577 --> 35:22.410
[dog whining]

35:22.411 --> 35:24.246
- Uh, Wrigley.
- [Rose] Hey.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.164
Here.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.998
Don't worry, she's friendly.

35:26.999 --> 35:30.168
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I'm Paul, this is Ruby.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.505
We were just hoping to talk
to Staff Sergeant Vega.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.298
My brother is dead.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.383
Oh, um...

35:36.384 --> 35:38.969
I'm so sorry. We wouldn't have
come here had we known--

35:38.970 --> 35:40.679
It's just my dad was a Marine.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.931
He was Staff Sergeant Vega's CO
for a time.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.891
My dad passed a couple of months back,

35:44.892 --> 35:47.895
and I've been traveling trying to connect
with the men that he led.

35:48.729 --> 35:53.150
Dad always said the Marines were a family,
and I'm missing mine.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.820
- [device beeping]
- [Wrigley whining]

35:57.280 --> 35:59.115
Fine. Come on in, then.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.248
Is this soap?

36:07.957 --> 36:09.958
All natural, organic, homemade.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.376
I have an online shop.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.630
There's a card on the table
if you're interested. Keeps me busy.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.094
Handsome, yeah?

36:21.846 --> 36:22.680
Yeah.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.143
Did he ever mention my dad,
Sergeant Major Don Casey?

36:27.852 --> 36:28.769
Don't recall.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.605
Are you sure my brother served under him?

36:31.606 --> 36:34.649
I'm not a hundred percent,
but the timing's right.

36:34.650 --> 36:38.320
My dad did four tours in Afghanistan,
starting in 2002.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.655
Solomon did five.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.741
Did he, um, die in the line of duty?

36:42.742 --> 36:43.701
Suicide.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.413
I am so sorry.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.169
When my dad retired,
he really struggled without the structure.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.587
My brother was a hero.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.797
All those who choose to serve are.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.967
I mean, to me. Outside of all that.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.928
[Peter] How exactly?

37:03.095 --> 37:06.139
Was changing a flat, hit-and-run driver
left me on the side of the road.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.183
Lost my legs.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.434
And your brother was there for you?

37:09.435 --> 37:12.270
Solomon dropped his papers to care for me.

37:12.271 --> 37:15.690
Struggled without the orders,
like you said. Lost his way.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.610
Baby brother's still looking out for me.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.820
I mean, I wouldn't have my chair
or Wrigley or this house

37:20.821 --> 37:22.614
without the VA benefits he left.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.784
It's nice to hear you were both so close.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.661
I miss him every day.

37:27.828 --> 37:28.829
I know.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.582
You mind if I grab a business card?

37:34.168 --> 37:35.627
[tense music playing]

37:35.628 --> 37:39.047
It's a little extra to fake your own death
just to take a job with this buyer guy.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.675
Solomon probably figures
Celeste is better off without him.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.219
She certainly doesn't think so.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.054
See what's in there.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.222
You stole Celeste's mail?

37:47.223 --> 37:49.683
What, the queen of shoplifting
is judging me?

37:49.684 --> 37:51.644
I'm not judging, admiring.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.478
I saw the bank statement.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.522
There's no way that the sister of a Marine

37:55.523 --> 37:58.650
is getting enough from the VA
and an online organic soap business

37:58.651 --> 37:59.651
to live that way.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.486
Just casually committing mail fraud.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.488
It's technically not mail fraud
until it's open,

38:03.489 --> 38:05.949
so <i>you're</i> committing mail fraud.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.411
Okay, she gets a stipend from the VA,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.955
some small deposits from soap sales,

38:11.956 --> 38:16.293
and a very large recurring payment
from a place called KinCare Trust.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.878
So Solomon arranges for Celeste
to be taken care of financially.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.797
KinCare Trust could lead us to his boss.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.090
Catherine will be pleased.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.385
Text her. Tell her "Solomon Vega."

38:24.885 --> 38:28.388
Also, you were, um,
pretty specific back there.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.265
Did you date a Marine or something?

38:30.266 --> 38:31.850
[chuckling] No, my mom did.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.935
Sergeant Major Don Casey?

38:33.936 --> 38:36.646
Yeah. He used to tell
these amazing stories.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.524
He always had candy
in his glove compartment for me.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.735
- I loved him.
- What happened to him?

38:41.736 --> 38:45.530
My mom cheated, of course.
Broke our hearts. I never saw him again.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.656
That's my mom.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.574
[cell phone chiming]

38:47.575 --> 38:50.578
Oh, Catherine asked me
to convince you to meet up with her.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.042
[Catherine] <i>Good work.
Let's get together right away.</i>

38:57.043 --> 38:58.668
- [Rose] Uh, where?
- [car door closing]

38:58.669 --> 39:01.088
[Catherine] <i>Brooklyn Bridge Park
ferry landing.</i>

39:01.589 --> 39:03.590
Uh, it will take us like an hour or so.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.549
[Catherine] <i>Fine.</i>

39:04.550 --> 39:07.135
Agents Yared and Shulenberger
from the Secret Service

39:07.136 --> 39:09.387
will collect you at the park
and take you to California.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.222
Chelsea Arrington isn't available?

39:11.223 --> 39:14.435
She's on the campaign trail
with one of the presidential candidates.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.480
What if I wanted to stay?

39:18.481 --> 39:21.107
I know you and Peter
both think I'm better off leaving,

39:21.108 --> 39:26.072
but I've felt safer in the past 12 hours
than I have in the last nine months.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.783
<i>Peter only met up with you last night
because of me.</i>

39:29.784 --> 39:30.951
And Alice's death?

39:32.036 --> 39:33.496
He's still holding on to it.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.998
And it's clearly affecting you too.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.749
<i>Share that with him.</i>

39:37.750 --> 39:40.126
<i>Give a little of yourself
so he doesn't feel so alone.</i>

39:40.127 --> 39:42.171
I'm a case officer, not a shrink.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.425
You may have read some long, dull report
of what Peter and I went through,

39:47.426 --> 39:50.221
but you have no idea
how terrifying that was.

39:51.305 --> 39:52.430
<i>I'm getting help.</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:55.059
He was just put on a plane,
isolated and traumatized.

39:59.438 --> 40:04.150
[in Farsi] So just you, Mom, and brother?

40:04.151 --> 40:05.069
[in Farsi] Yes.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.030
Baba passed a few years back.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.324
I'm sorry.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.450
What got him?

40:12.451 --> 40:15.370
- [car horns honking]
- [siren wailing in distance]

40:15.371 --> 40:17.081
This a date or an interrogation?

40:17.957 --> 40:19.290
Is there a difference?

40:19.291 --> 40:20.543
[both chuckling]

40:21.627 --> 40:24.295
No, sorry. A joke.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.256
[Javad breathing deeply, exhaling]

40:26.257 --> 40:29.760
My mom insists so much,
I don't try anymore,

40:30.886 --> 40:32.637
but I'm really bad at dating.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.556
[Noor] Hmm.

40:35.307 --> 40:36.517
Is there pressure?

40:37.601 --> 40:40.104
For grandkids, above all else.

40:42.648 --> 40:46.569
Mine's too busy raising my brother.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.614
But Farhad's freshly 18, so...

40:52.074 --> 40:54.660
About to be a grown man, a soldier.

40:55.411 --> 41:01.082
Give your mom a month at most with
an empty nest and the brooding will begin.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.083
[Noor chuckling]

41:02.084 --> 41:03.586
I think,

41:05.171 --> 41:06.172
finally,

41:06.797 --> 41:10.133
I convinced mine I work so much

41:10.134 --> 41:14.596
I don't have any time for marriage.

41:14.597 --> 41:17.016
Then I'm amazed you asked me out.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.267
You asked me!

41:19.268 --> 41:21.478
- I asked you?
- Yes, you asked me!

41:21.479 --> 41:23.521
[both chuckling]

41:23.522 --> 41:25.523
You realize your mistake now?

41:25.524 --> 41:27.443
Hardly my worst.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.822
Ah, I hoped they'd be here today.

41:35.451 --> 41:36.534
How did you know--

41:36.535 --> 41:38.328
Their <i>zoolbia's</i> no Maison Chai.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.289
But it's the best I've had in New York.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.083
You really know this city.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.045
I've grown to like it here.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.886
But I can't wait to be back in Isfahan.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.431
Where'd you go earlier today?

41:58.432 --> 42:01.434
Anywhere near Washington Heights?

42:01.435 --> 42:03.478
Oh, all over town.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.647
Dry cleaning pickup,

42:05.648 --> 42:07.941
document drop-offs,

42:07.942 --> 42:10.152
office-supply run.

42:10.986 --> 42:14.197
You know, all the stuff
no one really notices.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.033
[tense music playing]

42:16.575 --> 42:18.284
Thank you for your hard work.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.538
It doesn't go unnoticed.

42:22.122 --> 42:23.040
Thank you.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.804
Come on then. What are you waiting for?

42:37.304 --> 42:38.597
Buy me a treat.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.431
[both chuckling]

42:40.432 --> 42:41.517
[music fades]

42:42.726 --> 42:45.395
[ship horn blaring in distance]

42:45.396 --> 42:46.897
[indistinct chatter]

42:53.070 --> 42:55.905
Celeste Vega is listed in the VA database

42:55.906 --> 42:58.491
as Solomon Vega's
life-insurance beneficiary.

42:58.492 --> 43:01.996
But that's the only mention
of Solomon I could find.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.124
His birth, death, military file,

43:06.166 --> 43:08.209
all wiped from our system.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.963
Someone worked really hard
to make that man disappear.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.840
Rose and I met with his sister.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.718
She's taking payments
from a company called KinCare Trust.

43:16.719 --> 43:17.845
Come in every month.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.179
Follow the money...

43:20.180 --> 43:21.974
Find the employer. I get the idea.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.726
I'll look into it.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.686
- But you need to--
- No.

43:27.479 --> 43:29.607
No, first tell me
what happened in Bangkok.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.736
If we're gonna work together, Catherine,
I need to be able to trust you.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.279
[tense music playing]

43:36.280 --> 43:38.364
After Alice's death, I flew to Bangkok,

43:38.365 --> 43:41.201
reviewed every file,
spoke to every witness.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.621
Night Action is airtight.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.624
Maybe you or Alice made a mistake.

43:47.625 --> 43:51.002
- Could Alice have been overheard?
- No, no. She was too good for that.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.295
But it's not impossible.

43:52.296 --> 43:55.549
Let's set trust aside. Overused word.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.135
Let's focus on Alice.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.511
I know her death shook you.

44:00.512 --> 44:02.805
I felt it too, and I was two oceans away.

44:02.806 --> 44:06.518
But there is no conspiracy
to unravel in Bangkok.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.771
Just went bad.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.649
So we can waste our time wondering why,

44:12.650 --> 44:15.443
or we could work together
to find the men who killed Alice

44:15.444 --> 44:17.445
and retrieve the intel
they got their hands on.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.906
But we can't do both.

44:19.406 --> 44:20.824
[dramatic music playing]

44:24.453 --> 44:28.415
The intel Warren sold in Bangkok was info
on an experimental weapons program.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.417
It was joint CIA-Military Ops.

44:31.418 --> 44:34.129
It was called Foxglove.
Does that name mean anything to you?

44:34.838 --> 44:36.839
Not yet. But it will.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.925
Play her the tape.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.426
There's a tape?

44:40.427 --> 44:41.929
[suspenseful music playing]

44:42.763 --> 44:44.347
Yeah. Of Warren.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.058
And you're only telling me now?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.353
[recorder beeping]

44:50.354 --> 44:51.355
[Peter] <i>Bangkok.</i>

44:52.314 --> 44:53.982
<i>What intel were you selling?</i>

44:55.818 --> 44:58.111
[Warren] <i>There was a covert
military program</i>

44:58.112 --> 44:59.988
<i>initiated at the behest of the CIA.</i>

45:01.198 --> 45:03.783
<i>The file I sold was from
the early stages of development.</i>

45:03.784 --> 45:05.953
<i>It was theoretical shit. Nothing serious.</i>

45:06.995 --> 45:09.248
<i>And the whole program
was shuttered years ago.</i>

45:09.748 --> 45:10.873
[Peter] <i>What program?</i>

45:10.874 --> 45:12.417
[Warren] <i>It was called Foxglove.</i>

45:12.418 --> 45:15.086
<i>It dealt with experimental weapons
that were mostly chemical--</i>

45:15.087 --> 45:16.213
[gun firing]

45:20.926 --> 45:22.803
[man] <i>Northbound, you got your ears on?</i>

45:25.347 --> 45:28.016
[clearing throat]
10-2, you're blowing smoke.

45:28.934 --> 45:30.936
[both laughing]

45:31.478 --> 45:34.106
- You sound legit, man.
- Oh, it's CB lingo.

45:34.898 --> 45:38.902
Christina's dad took me on this, um,
long-haul hazing job over Christmas.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.779
Called it "bonding."

45:43.532 --> 45:44.366
[man 2] You see this?

45:49.788 --> 45:51.081
[truck tires screeching]

45:52.708 --> 45:54.710
[suspenseful music playing]

45:57.588 --> 45:59.465
- [man 3] Out!
- [man 4] Out of the truck, now!

46:00.674 --> 46:02.551
- On your knees!
- [man 3] Hurry up!

46:04.219 --> 46:05.345
Stay down!

46:07.556 --> 46:08.474
[zip ties zipping]

46:09.141 --> 46:10.684
It's okay, it's okay.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.353
[truck cargo door clanging]

46:14.605 --> 46:15.647
[indistinct chatter]

46:17.858 --> 46:19.942
[both grunting]

46:19.943 --> 46:20.943
[man 3] Stay down!

46:20.944 --> 46:23.030
[cargo door clanging]

46:23.739 --> 46:25.991
- [man 3] Stay on the floor!
- [man 5] Find the tracker?

46:30.621 --> 46:32.663
[man 4] Markus, what do we do with them?

46:32.664 --> 46:34.750
[Markus seething]

46:36.502 --> 46:39.213
[Markus] You were told to tie them up
and leave them.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.257
You were told no names, Elek.

46:44.676 --> 46:45.636
This is on you.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.554
[man] No. No!

46:48.555 --> 46:49.889
[gun firing]

46:49.890 --> 46:51.974
[Markus inhaling, exhaling]

46:51.975 --> 46:53.769
[Markus] Dump them behind the trees.

46:55.771 --> 46:56.647
[man 3] Hurry up.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.316
[Catherine] Mosley is speaking to the CIA.

47:00.317 --> 47:03.403
Does he know about Warren?
About Alice and our investigation?

47:03.904 --> 47:06.782
Only what he needed to
until things escalated in Bangkok.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.662
Rose wants to stay under your protection.

47:13.789 --> 47:17.083
Nothing for me in California
that can't wait for this to end.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.002
She's not here in any official role.

47:20.504 --> 47:24.132
But the tech Rose used
to ID Solomon, find you...

47:26.051 --> 47:27.093
may prove useful.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.471
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [Catherine] It's your call though.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.348
Yeah.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.185
- [Rose] You shouldn't be on your own.
- I'm used to it.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.938
I don't wanna be alone right now.

47:38.689 --> 47:39.981
[dramatic music playing]

47:39.982 --> 47:41.275
[Catherine] Understood.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.571
So, what's it gonna be?

47:46.864 --> 47:47.990
I got her.

47:50.659 --> 47:53.619
That was Mosley and CIA Director Gedney.

47:53.620 --> 47:59.668
Our search for Solomon Vega flagged images
taken earlier today by a new CIA asset.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.294
[Peter] Who is he?

48:01.295 --> 48:05.256
Abbas Mansuri, Iranian ambassador
to the United Nations.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.550
The next two images,

48:07.301 --> 48:10.845
the first with, then without a briefcase,
you'll recognize.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.179
[Peter] Solomon Vega.

48:12.180 --> 48:14.348
- So they exchanged something.
- Looks like it.

48:14.349 --> 48:15.516
Who took the picture?

48:15.517 --> 48:16.643
Noor Taheri.

48:17.269 --> 48:20.104
<i>She's a junior aide
to the Iranian mission at the UN</i>

48:20.105 --> 48:23.441
<i>looking for asylum
for her and her family in the U.S.</i>

48:23.442 --> 48:26.235
So Solomon might have
given her boss the Foxglove intel.

48:26.236 --> 48:30.032
- How do we learn what's in the briefcase?
- Peter can ask Noor tomorrow.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.366
We're taking over her case.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.453
[suspenseful music playing]

48:37.247 --> 48:40.918
[in Farsi] Today was my best day
in New York.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.295
[in Farsi] It was very memorable.

48:44.546 --> 48:47.215
Thank you for lunch
and for walking me home.

48:48.216 --> 48:49.217
Of course.

48:50.385 --> 48:53.263
Until tomorrow, Noor.

49:10.572 --> 49:13.616
And you really must come view
the gallery with me, darling.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.744
Because there's one painting,
ooh, in particular,

49:16.745 --> 49:19.330
that'd look absolutely smashing
in our kitchen.

49:19.331 --> 49:20.832
- Another painting?
- Yeah.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.626
And I really want it.

49:23.627 --> 49:24.711
[cell phone chiming]

49:25.629 --> 49:27.381
Uh, it's Markus. Just be a moment.

[door opening]

49:36.056 --> 49:37.891

49:41.061 --> 49:42.521
[Markus] <i>We took the whole thing.</i>

49:43.021 --> 49:47.401
<i>Not the plan, I know, but trust me,
cousin, it's better this way.</i>

49:48.193 --> 49:49.111
<i>Meet you tomorrow.</i>

49:50.153 --> 49:52.155
[suspenseful music swelling]
