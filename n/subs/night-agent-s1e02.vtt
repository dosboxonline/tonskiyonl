changed the rules in spy land?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.698
What about surveillance footage
near their house?

10:57.698 --> 10:58.949
Nothing helpful.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.701
So the bureau's nowhere?

11:00.701 --> 11:03.704
Maybe Secret Service
needs to step in more.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.830
- Maybe.
- [man 2] Hmm.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.417
You stay on your own turf there,
buddy boy. FBI's got a handle on this.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.710
Just no suspects.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.215
I'd like to take another crack
at the girl, see what she's hiding.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.258
Don't you think
she's been traumatized enough, sir?

11:16.258 --> 11:19.095
It's called conducting
an investigation, Sutherland.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.889
And you're lucky you're even invited
up here with the grown-ups.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.975
Your prize witness wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for him.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.687
What else aren't you sharing
about your investigation?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.651
That's all I have to share.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.945
As far as the outside world's concerned,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.197
this was two business people
killed in a home robbery.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.157
But how long is that story going to hold?

11:40.157 --> 11:44.245
When it does fall apart, let's look like
we have a fucking clue what we're doing.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.664
That's all.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.461
[door opening]

11:53.921 --> 11:54.839
[Diane] Peter.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.341
Yes, ma'am?

11:59.927 --> 12:02.054
What do you think? About Hawkins?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.390
I think
he didn't like me sitting in his chair.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.725
Let's double-check his work.

12:06.225 --> 12:09.186
I'm gonna get you the case files
for the Campbells from over the years.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.021
I don't think I'm cleared for that.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.189
I'll get you read in.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.775
Okay. What do you want me to look for?

12:14.775 --> 12:15.985
A reason they were targeted,

12:15.985 --> 12:18.237
any connections
Hawkins isn't telling us about.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.739
Peter, look,

12:20.364 --> 12:22.199
you've been a good soldier.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.201
Done everything I've asked
in Night Action.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.661
I know you're capable of more.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.122
You want to do more.
Now I'm asking for more.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.833
We're wading into very murky waters here.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.211
Are you ready to do whatever it takes
to get to the bottom of this muck?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.422
To keep Rose Larkin safe?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.090
Absolutely.

12:39.091 --> 12:39.925
Good.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.302
[tense music playing]

12:42.386 --> 12:46.390
The last 12 months, I've been training you
for something. I wasn't sure what for.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.517
But now we know.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.477
It's this.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.188
Time to step up.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.776
Yes, ma'am.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.945
[indistinct chatter]

13:00.696 --> 13:02.490
[phones ringing]

13:02.490 --> 13:04.033
Hey, Liam.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.328
Anything on that, uh, screenshot
I sent you?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.621
Uh, yeah.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.372
Not sure how it helps.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.793
So this is the ring
you caught on camera last night.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.710
Yeah.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.045
I found this sigil.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.881
Looks pretty damn close.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.049
[Peter] What's it from?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.843
Family crest
from the Royal House of Yugoslavia.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.720
There's a couple of differences,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.264
so I'm guessing
the original owner of that ring

13:27.264 --> 13:30.059
is probably a distant relative
to the crown prince.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.146
Can we get anything more on it?
Like, uh, maybe check museums,

13:34.146 --> 13:36.315
I don't know,
auction houses, anything like that?

13:36.315 --> 13:39.235
Excuse me? You're my boss now, phone boy?

13:40.528 --> 13:41.654
Please?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
Look, no-can-do, I'm buried.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.407
What's this all about anyway?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.618
Can't tell you. It's above your clearance.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.994
No, seriously.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.414
Seriously?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.917
[tense music playing]

13:58.504 --> 13:59.505
[scanner beeping]

14:19.149 --> 14:21.151
[police siren wailing in distance]

14:44.341 --> 14:46.427
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.972
- What kind of tea is this?
- Pu-erh.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.849
- What is that, Chinese?
- I believe so.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.852
It's not gonna make me sleepy, is it?
I've got a long night.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.354
No, it's supposed to give you energy.
I checked.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.480
Okay, thanks.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.441
[cell phone vibrating]

15:00.441 --> 15:01.609
[phone line ringing]

15:01.609 --> 15:03.068
[Diane] <i>Peter, everything okay?</i>

15:03.068 --> 15:07.239
Hey, did you know Hawkins used to be
Emma and Henry Campbell's old FBI handler?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.365
- What?
- [Peter] <i>Yeah.</i>

15:08.365 --> 15:09.825
It's really hard to find,

15:09.825 --> 15:13.495
but I recognize his initials
on some old sign-offs.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.496
These are...

15:15.080 --> 15:16.457
these are going back years.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.416
Shit.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.084
You're sure?

15:19.084 --> 15:21.003
[sighing] He didn't tell you he knew them?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.422
No. I knew he worked
in counterintelligence

15:23.422 --> 15:24.840
before his promotion, but...

15:26.550 --> 15:27.509
Fuck a duck.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.511
Shit, I wonder why he didn't tell you.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.473
<i>What else is he hiding, you know?</i>

15:32.473 --> 15:35.893
Separate the cases he oversaw.
Have them on my desk in the morning.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.395
And, Peter, keep this between us for now.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.313
Yeah.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.075
[Peter sniffling]

15:52.618 --> 15:53.869
[phone ringing]

15:57.915 --> 15:59.375
Uh, yes, go ahead.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.335
[Rose] <i>Peter, is that you?</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:03.921
- Rose?
- [Rose] <i>Yeah.</i>

16:03.921 --> 16:05.714
I can't sleep, and...

16:07.091 --> 16:08.926
um, I remembered the number.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.553
Wait, you--? You remembered this number?

16:11.553 --> 16:13.889
- [Rose] <i>Yeah, my brain works like that.</i>
- [Peter chuckling]

16:13.889 --> 16:15.849
I was hoping you would answer.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.643
[Peter] Uh, yeah, I mean, it's me.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.478
It's... it's late. Are you okay?

16:19.478 --> 16:20.396
[Rose] <i>No.</i>

16:20.396 --> 16:24.566
I just really needed to hear a voice,
and I... I don't really have anyone, so...

16:25.484 --> 16:27.027
I'm... I'm... I'm here.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.321
Do you know anything more

16:29.321 --> 16:31.448
<i>about what happened to my aunt and uncle?</i>

16:31.448 --> 16:33.951
We're looking into some things, all right?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.578
Uh, we'll see where it goes.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.622
We're making progress, okay? I promise.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.166
Wait, hang on.
Don't you have to keep this line open?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.835
Just in case someone else calls?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.044
You really think it's set up,

16:44.044 --> 16:46.255
so a night agent in trouble
gets a busy signal?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.841
[Rose] <i>Last time I called,
you said you had to keep the line open.</i>

16:48.841 --> 16:51.468
Yeah. You didn't have the right answers
to the code questions.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.554
So you were just trying to hang up on me.

16:54.054 --> 16:54.972
That's kind of rude.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.016
[chuckling] Sorry. Sorry, okay?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.143
I won't hang up on you tonight, I promise.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.395
You better not. I can be very vindictive.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.105
Yeah, I don't wanna find out.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.110
Can I ask you a question?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.988
[Peter] <i>Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.</i>

17:10.988 --> 17:13.073
[dramatic music playing]

17:13.657 --> 17:15.534
Do you know what happens next to me?

17:16.493 --> 17:19.246
[sighing] I... I wish I knew, Rose.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.501
[Rose sighing]

17:33.260 --> 17:35.429
It doesn't matter what's in the bag.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.515
[scoffing] Yeah.
It's obviously worth killing for.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.934
We weren't told we had to kill her.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.935
No.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.980
But faster, safer,

17:45.481 --> 17:47.775
and he didn't tell us not to kill her.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.531
What do you think's in there?

17:54.531 --> 17:57.451
[sighing heavily]
Stop torturing yourself, okay?

18:00.162 --> 18:01.080
You're right.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.540
I'll just look.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.961
You'll still love me.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.345
What the actual fuck?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
[suspenseful music playing]

18:20.307 --> 18:21.475
Satisfied?

18:23.018 --> 18:24.478
It's a nanny cam.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.022
What cords do we need
to download what's on here?

18:27.856 --> 18:30.192
Anticipation is always better
than the result.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.152
Trust me.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.862
[cell phone vibrating]

18:33.862 --> 18:34.822
Fine.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.324
Uh, it's him.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.368
[phone line ringing]

18:39.368 --> 18:40.285
[man] <i>Yes?</i>

18:40.285 --> 18:41.620
You back in town yet?

18:41.620 --> 18:42.871
We just got here.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.124
[man 2] I've got new intel on the target.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.792
[man] <i>Okay, we're ready.</i>

18:47.417 --> 18:48.919
Try to close this time.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.172
There's a good chance
she saw you at the house and can ID you.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.883
In case you needed additional incentive.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.552
Who's that?

18:57.886 --> 19:00.764
He's someone with a vested interest
in this all working out.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.308
<i>And he's right, the girl's a problem.</i>

19:03.308 --> 19:05.060
Just tell me where she is, okay?

19:07.062 --> 19:07.896
Wait.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.193
[pen scribbling]

19:14.486 --> 19:15.320
[man] Got it.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.241
Well, it's all taken care of.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.618
How long have these people worked for you?

19:21.618 --> 19:23.620
Well, him, over eight years.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.830
Excellent results.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.332
He brought her in a couple of years ago.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.626
They make a good team.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.920
I mean, no one's asked for a refund yet.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.507
The whole thing makes me ill.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.219
[Rose] <i>Did you always want
to be an FBI agent?</i>

19:39.219 --> 19:41.054
[Peter] Um, no.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.514
I... I actually...

19:44.641 --> 19:46.226
I wanted to play in the NBA.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.145
Why didn't you?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.230
Because I sucked in college.

19:50.814 --> 19:54.943
If you suck in college, they definitely
don't let you play in the pros.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.322
That kind of thinking
doesn't fly in Silicon Valley.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.200
<i>If you have a dream, make it happen,</i>

20:01.200 --> 20:03.660
no matter how many rules
you have to break.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.204
Well, what happened to your dream?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.540
Didn't you have a, uh, business
or something like that?

20:09.041 --> 20:09.958
[Rose exhaling]

20:12.628 --> 20:13.587
Well, it, um...

20:15.839 --> 20:17.591
It crashed and burned, and...

20:18.926 --> 20:22.638
<i>when I looked around, I was the only one
not wearing a parachute.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:25.515
I was the boss, and I...

20:27.684 --> 20:29.436
I let a friend betray me.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.315
Expensive lesson.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.817
Sorry that happened.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.491
You still there?

20:44.868 --> 20:45.827
Yeah, I...

20:46.578 --> 20:48.205
I think I'm falling asleep.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.583
[Peter] <i>That's a good thing, okay?
You need sleep.</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:02.052
Peter?

21:02.052 --> 21:04.012
[emotional music playing]

21:04.012 --> 21:05.305
[Peter] <i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:09.893
I'm so lonely...

21:12.104 --> 21:13.105
all the time.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.903
Especially now that they're gone, and...

21:24.950 --> 21:27.035
Can you have breakfast with me tomorrow,

21:27.828 --> 21:29.079
when you finish work?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.876
Yeah, sure.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.505
We have to get room service
'cause they don't let me out of my room.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.216
[Peter] <i>I... I figured.</i>

21:41.216 --> 21:42.718
[both laughing]

21:42.718 --> 21:45.887
Sounds good. What, 10:30? Late breakfast?

21:47.097 --> 21:47.973
Okay.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.434
- [Peter] <i>See ya.</i>
- Bye.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.356
The last one.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.324
Val, can I get some more
of that Chinese tea from last night?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.450
Had a real kick to it.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.745
Yes, ma'am.
And, heads up, you've got a squatter.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.830
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.372 --> 22:13.749
[phones ringing]

22:21.631 --> 22:23.050
[elevator bell dinging]

22:26.219 --> 22:27.554
Should I charge you rent?

22:27.554 --> 22:29.139
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.851
I was gonna put those on your desk,
and then laid down on the couch and just--

22:32.851 --> 22:35.771
Find any connections
between Hawkins and the Campbells?

22:35.771 --> 22:37.689
Any idea who might have killed them?

22:37.689 --> 22:41.234
Not really, no. But I marked up
all their cases that he oversaw.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.987
Thanks. Go get some real sleep.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.739
Can't, I gotta shower,

22:45.739 --> 22:48.283
and, um,
I was gonna go see Rose at her hotel.

22:48.283 --> 22:51.161
- I promised I'd check up on her.
- Wait, she contacted you again?

22:51.161 --> 22:53.038
Yeah. Yeah, she wants to see me.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.039
Good.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.167
You're forming a connection.
Could be valuable.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.503
You need anything before I go?

22:59.503 --> 23:00.420
Go.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.006
Let me know if she opens up.

23:03.006 --> 23:03.924
Yeah.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.844
[upbeat music playing]

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
[tense music playing]

23:25.153 --> 23:26.363
- Hey. Excuse me.
- Hi.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.532
Where are the Secret Service agents
that were here?

23:28.532 --> 23:31.201
Oh, uh, they were there earlier.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.160
[people exclaiming]

23:32.160 --> 23:33.578
[woman] Whoa.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.663
[Peter] No.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.208
[suspenseful music playing]

24:06.528 --> 24:07.362
Rose?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.406
Rose?

24:10.073 --> 24:10.949
[door opening]

24:10.949 --> 24:12.117
- Rose?
- [Rose] Yeah?

24:12.701 --> 24:13.869
Hey. [panting]

24:15.370 --> 24:17.497
- [Rose] What's happening?
- We have to get out of here.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.832
How'd you get in here?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.041
They cut the power.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.128
The lock on your door isn't working.
We have to go. Come on.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.213
[intense music playing]

24:33.472 --> 24:34.598
Housekeeping.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.351
[Peter] Come here.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.773
Housekeeping.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.451
She's not here.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.244
[man] <i>Copy.
I'll meet you in the stairwell.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:09.299
[door closing]

25:14.262 --> 25:15.472
[Rose gasping]

25:18.141 --> 25:19.684
Come with me. Come on. Rose.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.565
- [Rose grunting]
- [Peter] Go.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.400
This way. Come on.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.336
You good?

25:47.504 --> 25:48.505
Go, go, go, go.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.006
What happened to the Secret Service?

25:50.006 --> 25:51.716
- Someone must've pulled them.
- [Rose] What?

25:54.928 --> 25:56.304
[man grunting]

26:01.351 --> 26:02.477
- Go!
- [Rose] Okay.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.944
- Peter.
- Yeah, I'm here.

26:19.035 --> 26:19.953
Shit.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.418
You're late again. What a surprise.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.337
[woman grunting, groaning]

26:34.759 --> 26:36.219
[Rose panting]

26:39.973 --> 26:41.016
This way. Go.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.519
This way.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.857
Okay.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.108
We can't go back.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.578
Here's the plan.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.122
We wait here,
he tries to break in, and you shoot him.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.290
I'm out, Rose.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.542
Out of what? Bullets?

27:07.542 --> 27:08.752
Yeah.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.045
You think he's out of bullets?

27:10.045 --> 27:12.005
- I doubt it.
- So, what's your plan?

27:14.090 --> 27:14.924
[Rose gasping]

27:15.550 --> 27:16.885
[glass breaking in distance]

27:35.445 --> 27:37.489
Okay, I-- I think I see a way down.
Come on.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.657
Okay, fuck that.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.784
Rose. Rose, it's gonna be fine.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.118
- Take my hand.
- Okay.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.662
Come on.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.082
Oh my God!

27:49.918 --> 27:50.919
Are you okay?

27:52.128 --> 27:52.962
Peter?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.173
Your turn.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.050
- I'm not jumping down.
- [Peter] I'll catch you.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.176
- You'll catch me?
- Yes.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.177
That's crazy.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.845
Crazier than waiting for your friend?

28:03.890 --> 28:05.392
How should I jump so you can catch me?

28:05.392 --> 28:07.394
I don't know, but you have to jump, Rose.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.273
- [door rattling]
- [Rose gasping]

28:12.857 --> 28:16.486
I'll fall forward so my body weight's
distributed across more area.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.321
Sounds great. Just jump, come on.

28:19.989 --> 28:20.824
Rose!

28:23.952 --> 28:25.203
[Rose screaming]

28:25.203 --> 28:26.121
[both grunting]

28:27.247 --> 28:28.331
[Rose panting]

28:28.331 --> 28:29.332
Come on.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.136
They're on the street
in front of the hotel.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.986
We gotta get some clothes for you.
We'll cross here.

29:00.655 --> 29:01.781
[Peter] Here. Come on.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.451
[doorbell chiming]

29:05.118 --> 29:06.035
[door closing]

29:07.620 --> 29:09.497
[woman] Hello. How can I help you?

29:09.497 --> 29:12.083
Um, I have a bit of a wardrobe emergency.

29:14.002 --> 29:14.961
Thanks.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.178
[woman] Uh, yeah.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.696
Rose, what are you doing?
You can't steal that lady's phone.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.823
You won't let me have my phone
so no one can track us?

29:43.823 --> 29:44.741
Yeah, right.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.242
Well, someone tracked us.

29:46.242 --> 29:49.329
So call the White House
and see who pulled my fucking security.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.624
[doorbell chiming]

30:01.382 --> 30:02.467
[knocking on door]

30:02.467 --> 30:03.384
[door opening]

30:07.972 --> 30:10.642
[whispering] Ma'am,
it's Peter Sutherland on line two.

30:16.105 --> 30:16.940
This is Farr.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.734
It's Peter. What happened
to Rose's protection at the hotel?

30:19.734 --> 30:20.819
What're you talking about?

30:20.819 --> 30:25.198
When I got there, Secret Service was gone.
The people who are after Rose were there.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.699
<i>They almost killed her, me too.</i>

30:26.699 --> 30:28.952
Everyone except these two out of the room.

30:30.119 --> 30:30.954
Now!

30:31.830 --> 30:33.832
[suspenseful music playing]

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
Peter, you're on speaker.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.796
It's just me, Ben Almora,
and Nathan Briggs from Secret Service.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.339
Repeat what you just told me.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.925
[Peter] <i>Somebody pulled
the protection detail off of Rose's hotel.</i>

30:43.925 --> 30:46.302
<i>We were almost killed.
It was the same guy as before.</i>

30:46.302 --> 30:47.679
We both saw his face.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.888
What the fuck happened?

30:48.888 --> 30:51.724
- That's impossible.
- Then change your definition of the word.

30:51.724 --> 30:53.017
Ben?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.811
- Nathan?
- Checking.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.229
[woman] Hello.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.147
Help you with anything?

30:58.731 --> 31:00.733
I'm just looking for some friends.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.527
[Ben] <i>Okay, here's what we know.</i>

31:02.527 --> 31:05.446
The command was sent 30 minutes ago
on the Pegasus system

31:06.197 --> 31:08.116
ordering our agents to disengage.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.909
- [Peter] <i>How does that happen?</i>
- It shouldn't.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.327
Who has power to authorize that?

31:11.327 --> 31:14.581
The president, myself, Ben and Nathan
here, Director Willett, and--

31:14.581 --> 31:16.541
Deputy Director Jamie Hawkins.

31:17.917 --> 31:18.793
That's right.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.756
Okay, where's Hawkins right now?

31:23.756 --> 31:24.757
We're calling.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.890
Peter, is Rose okay? Are you okay?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.017
We'll be better
when you can tell us what's going on.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.602
[Diane] <i>That's what we're working on.</i>

31:36.436 --> 31:39.272
Hawkins' office doesn't know where he is.
They can't reach him.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.232
Well, isn't that fucking suspicious?

31:41.232 --> 31:42.692
Track him down now, Nathan.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.610
Yes, sir.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.951
Peter, where are you?
We'll send someone to pick you up.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.661
[whispering] No.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.789
Not until you can get this shit
under control.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.835
I'm taking care of Rose until
you can figure out who's behind this.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.253
Peter, what are you doing?

32:02.253 --> 32:04.339
Whatever it takes
to keep her safe, remember?

32:06.466 --> 32:07.550
I'll keep in touch.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.093
[dial tone droning]

32:13.765 --> 32:14.599
[music fades]

32:14.599 --> 32:16.684
I'll try to figure out some place
we can lay low.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.103
We can't just keep
waiting for them to kill me, okay?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.396
We need to get proactive.

32:20.396 --> 32:24.067
Figure out what my aunt and uncle
were investigating and who it threatened.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.110
How do you think we do that?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.572
I... I have no idea,
but I know where to start.

32:32.992 --> 32:34.827
[birds chirping]

32:37.080 --> 32:38.039
[Rose sighing]

32:39.457 --> 32:41.668
Are you sure you wanna do this?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.127
No.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.510
[door opening]

33:01.229 --> 33:03.231
[dramatic music playing]

33:10.488 --> 33:11.656
They shot her?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.575
How many times?

33:17.036 --> 33:17.954
Six.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.545
We used to play hide-and-seek
in this room.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.424
She taught me origami here.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.343
We'd play Scrabble.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.308
Now it's just a place
where someone slaughtered her.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.233
I wanna get these motherfuckers.

33:50.945 --> 33:51.821
[Peter] Me too.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.788
I haven't told you everything yet.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.044
What do you mean?
What haven't you told me?

34:12.175 --> 34:16.304
Uh, everything I overheard my aunt
and uncle talking about that night.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.681
[Peter] Okay, like what?

34:21.350 --> 34:23.061
You're really on my side, aren't you?

34:24.645 --> 34:27.065
How many times you want me
to get shot at to prove it?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.652
Do you know who Osprey is?

34:31.652 --> 34:32.570
Osprey?

34:32.570 --> 34:35.114
Yeah, they kept talking about Osprey,

34:35.114 --> 34:38.785
about warning him or her
what was happening in the White House.

34:39.494 --> 34:40.411
I... I don't know.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.831
I don't know. It sounds like a code name.
It could be their handler, maybe.

34:45.249 --> 34:49.128
They also mentioned some files
and an engineer.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.006
Maybe they hid them here.

34:52.006 --> 34:55.301
Look, the FBI and state police
were all over this place.

34:55.301 --> 34:58.638
If there was something useful like files,
they'd have them by now.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.847
[Rose rummaging]

35:01.182 --> 35:02.350
Hey.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.812
Rose, just take a breath, okay?
What else did they say?

35:05.812 --> 35:07.897
I mean, you have this... this great memory.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.358
Shit, you memorized
the Night Action line by heart.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.442
You saw it once.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.778
What else did they say?

35:15.530 --> 35:18.574
Uh, that the country was in trouble.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.410
[Peter] Okay, did they say how?

35:21.410 --> 35:24.580
No, but my aunt said
that there was someone in the White House

35:24.580 --> 35:25.748
who couldn't be trusted.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.709
She said that it was only seven days
till it goes down.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.753
- Till what goes down?
- I don't know.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.880
But she sounded scared.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.508
All right. They say anything else?

35:35.508 --> 35:39.637
My uncle said something about
them taking a drive in the woods.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.015
- Drive in the woods? What does that mean?
- I don't know.

35:43.015 --> 35:46.102
Okay, what did he say exactly?

35:47.103 --> 35:50.857
"We still have the drive in the woods."

35:50.857 --> 35:51.816
The drive?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.278
Could that be like a... like a hard drive?

35:56.445 --> 35:57.280
A hard drive.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.615
Okay, what woods? Where?
What's he talking about?

36:00.491 --> 36:01.868
I know where that is.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.829
Uh, we'll take their car.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.416
Okay. Grab some clothes or something
while you're here.

36:08.916 --> 36:09.917
[Rose] Yeah.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.294
Some shoes, maybe?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.464
Yeah, upstairs.

36:15.464 --> 36:17.550
[suspenseful music playing]

36:19.093 --> 36:22.513
- Hey, Rose, I'll drive. Give me the keys.
- You just assume the man drives?

36:22.513 --> 36:24.765
No, I assume
I'm the only one formally trained

36:24.765 --> 36:27.685
in evasive maneuver techniques
and counter-surveillance.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.479
Okay, valid.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.233
Also need to pick up
a prepaid phone on the way.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.610
Some bullets, maybe?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.236
Yeah, and some bullets, maybe.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.404
[car engine starting]

36:42.283 --> 36:44.285
[ominous music playing]

36:48.539 --> 36:49.790
[doorbell ringing]

36:58.758 --> 36:59.842
Hello.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.242
In a couple miles,
you take the next right.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.495
You gonna tell me where we're going?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.163
The woods.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.457
[both chuckling]

37:32.541 --> 37:36.170
My uncle's brother, Ron, built a cabin
out there, like, 30 years ago.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.172
He stopped using it
when he moved to Japan.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.632
My aunt and uncle took it over

37:39.632 --> 37:41.759
when they wanted
to get away from the world.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.136
When they wanted some peace.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.932
You know, you don't have to do all this.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.726
Try to figure it all out.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.062
Okay? That's what the FBI does.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.441
All we gotta do
is keep you safe while we do it.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.737
What happened at the hotel
is not gonna happen again.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.281
Okay? I promise.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.687
[car engine stopping]

38:40.484 --> 38:42.069
So you used to come here a lot?

38:42.653 --> 38:43.863
[Rose] Plenty. [sighing]

38:43.863 --> 38:46.073
[birds chirping]

38:51.287 --> 38:53.039
[lock clicking]

38:59.211 --> 39:01.255
Looks like, uh,
someone cleaned in here recently.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.090
Yeah.

39:03.924 --> 39:05.468
Aunt Emma liked things neat.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.306
There aren't that many places to look.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.558
Yeah.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.772
[woman seething]

39:19.440 --> 39:21.442
[screaming]

39:23.402 --> 39:25.112
[man shushing]

39:25.112 --> 39:26.947
Hey, hey.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.657
Come here. It's okay.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.910
It's okay. Come here.

39:31.952 --> 39:32.787
Hey.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.830
We need to be patient.

39:36.082 --> 39:36.916
Okay?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.043
Patience.

39:42.004 --> 39:43.672
I don't like losing.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.051
They have to win every time.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.136
We only have to win once.

39:49.762 --> 39:50.596
[woman scoffing]

39:51.555 --> 39:53.265
[whispering] I wish I thought like you.

39:54.016 --> 39:54.892
No,

39:56.268 --> 39:57.103
you don't.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.193
I love you with everything.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.279
I love you too.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.838
[woman breathing heavily]

40:26.966 --> 40:28.342
[woman] Try to fuck me.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.179
Stop. It doesn't work.
You know it doesn't work.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.222
[woman] Use your hand.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.642
Use your hand the way I like it.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.895
[phone line ringing]

40:42.398 --> 40:43.691
[woman panting, moaning]

40:43.691 --> 40:44.942
[woman] Oh God.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.235
- Fuck.
- [cell phone vibrating]

40:47.570 --> 40:48.404
Yeah?

40:48.404 --> 40:49.572
Change of plans.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.116
Need to put you in motion.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.033
When?

40:54.076 --> 40:54.910
[man] <i>Now.</i>

40:56.120 --> 40:57.329
Are you busy?

40:57.329 --> 40:58.914
- Okay.
- [woman breathing heavily]

40:58.914 --> 40:59.832
Yes.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.588
What?

41:05.588 --> 41:06.672
[woman grunting]

41:08.466 --> 41:09.717
Okay, we have to go.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.720
[crickets chirping]

41:14.889 --> 41:16.474
[Peter exhaling]

41:18.392 --> 41:21.145
Okay, maybe they hid it outside.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.731
Well, if they did,
where would we even begin to look?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.566
We'll start with the porch.

41:28.277 --> 41:30.279
[fire crackling]

41:39.330 --> 41:40.372
[rock rattling]

41:43.083 --> 41:44.502
[whispering] No fucking way.

41:47.671 --> 41:48.714
[Peter grunting]

41:54.803 --> 41:56.472
[ominous music playing]

41:56.472 --> 41:57.848
[Peter] Rose, get in here.

41:59.391 --> 42:00.726
- Look at this.
- [Rose gasping]

42:06.899 --> 42:08.275
- [keyboard clacking]
- Okay.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.819
What were my aunt and uncle up to?

42:14.365 --> 42:15.699
Huh?

42:15.699 --> 42:16.617
What?

42:17.660 --> 42:20.704
Uh, just a little extra security
on the drive.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.707
It shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to open my tools.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.087
No fucking way.

42:28.087 --> 42:30.297
What? What is it?

42:30.297 --> 42:31.882
This thing's protected.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.677
Well, hack it.
Isn't, like, cybersecurity what you do?

42:34.677 --> 42:38.055
Uh, this isn't ordinary security,
or second or third level.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.641
My aunt acted like
she couldn't even set up a modem.

42:40.641 --> 42:44.144
But this has national-intelligence level
security that I can't even get around.

42:44.144 --> 42:46.522
[keyboard clacking]

42:52.695 --> 42:54.113
This thing's locked.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.990
- [Rose sighing]
- So you can't see anything?

42:55.990 --> 43:00.035
Well, there's just a folder
with a name on it, but it can't be opened.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.417
No way.

43:07.543 --> 43:08.752
[ominous music playing]

43:10.546 --> 43:12.631
- What? What?
- [Peter] Holy shit. No, no.

43:12.631 --> 43:16.135
2781 is the number
of the metro train I was on.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.636
The one that got bombed, Rose.

43:17.636 --> 43:20.180
What the hell were your aunt
and uncle doing investigating that?

43:20.180 --> 43:23.976
Well, I don't know until I can crack it,
which I can't do without serious hardware.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.063
Hey, who are you calling?

43:28.063 --> 43:30.107
Diane Farr. She can get you
the hardware you need.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.358
[Rose] Hey, slow down.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.152
We don't know who we can trust.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.237
What if she tracks the call
and sends someone here?

43:35.237 --> 43:38.157
She can't trace this call.
I'm calling the Night Action line.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.036
[Diane] This is Farr.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.663
[man] <i>This is Night Action.
I have Peter Sutherland for you.</i>

43:44.663 --> 43:45.706
Put him through.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.375
- Where are you? Where's Rose?
- [Peter] <i>We're safe.</i>

43:48.375 --> 43:50.419
Did you figure out
who pulled her protection?

43:50.419 --> 43:52.838
Hawkins called off
her Secret Service detail.

43:52.838 --> 43:53.922
[Peter] <i>You're sure?</i>

43:54.423 --> 43:57.134
The order was issued
from a computer in his office.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.385
He confess?

43:58.385 --> 43:59.386
No.

43:59.386 --> 44:02.723
Looks like whoever his accomplices were
made sure he couldn't tell us anything.

44:04.266 --> 44:06.644
A farmer found him in a field in Maryland.

44:07.227 --> 44:08.187
Murdered.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.565
Somebody killed
the deputy director of the FBI?

44:11.565 --> 44:13.317
Shot him in the back six times.

44:14.109 --> 44:14.943
Six times?

44:14.943 --> 44:17.154
[Peter] It's not safe
for you and Rose out there.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.280
What are you doing?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.701
We found a hard drive.

44:22.701 --> 44:24.995
<i>Rose's aunt and uncle were hiding it.</i>

44:24.995 --> 44:26.997
We can't get into it. It's encrypted.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.875
I think it has something to do
with the metro bombing.

44:29.875 --> 44:33.504
Peter, come in already.
Just bring Rose and come on in.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.382
<i>If Hawkins was behind this,
whoever his accomplices were,</i>

44:36.382 --> 44:38.133
they'll kill anyone they deem a threat,

44:38.133 --> 44:40.386
and you and Rose
are definitely a threat now.

44:41.428 --> 44:42.846
<i>Peter, this is an order.</i>

44:42.846 --> 44:44.223
Come in right now

44:44.223 --> 44:46.600
and bring Rose
and the hard drive with you.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.024
[suspenseful music swelling]

44:56.151 --> 44:57.903
[ending theme song playing]
