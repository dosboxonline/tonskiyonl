00:06.089 --> 00:07.131
[tense music playing]

00:07.132 --> 00:09.675
[Aiden] A chemical weapon
in the hands of unknown assailants,

00:09.676 --> 00:12.011
agents chasing ghosts
around every corner of the city,

00:12.012 --> 00:15.681
and your only solid lead
managed to disappear with your agent.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.182
Is Sutherland a suspect now?

00:17.183 --> 00:20.102
The secretary general
of the United Nations

00:20.103 --> 00:21.395
has something that I seek.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.896
You bring me that file,

00:22.897 --> 00:26.692
and I'll give you the location of where
the Foxglove weapon is being assembled

00:26.693 --> 00:29.570
and where Ms. Larkin
is currently being held captive.

00:29.571 --> 00:33.032
I need to get into the UN. If you help me,
I can take you to your mother.

00:33.033 --> 00:33.991
[panel beeping]

00:33.992 --> 00:35.285
[printer whirring]

00:35.869 --> 00:36.994
[Abbas in Farsi] It's true...

00:36.995 --> 00:39.164
You're spying for the Americans.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.832
[Noor in Farsi] The French report...

00:41.833 --> 00:43.751
Your daughter's on that list.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.753
Let me leave.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.754
We can warn these people.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.589
Give your daughter that chance.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.508
- [in English] Where is he?
- I need you to trust me. Shoot me,

00:51.509 --> 00:52.885
or get out of my way.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.596
Under no circumstances
can you complete your work here, doctor.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.431
Stall, and I'll get you and the girl out.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.348
What's going on?

00:58.349 --> 01:00.809
We are done doing it your way.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.978
- You're taking this too far.
- [Markus] Lock him in the fridge.

01:02.979 --> 01:06.566
- I am Tomás Bala!
- You were never worthy of the Bala name.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.403
[Tomás] No! No!

01:12.197 --> 01:14.199
[Tomás screaming]

01:15.200 --> 01:17.202
[screaming continues]

01:19.120 --> 01:20.205
[music fades]

01:22.123 --> 01:24.125
[opening theme music playing]

01:31.883 --> 01:33.759
[Peter] What,
are you trying to walk me to death?

01:33.760 --> 01:36.720
[Rose chuckling] Did you know
that one of the Thomas Jefferson quotes

01:36.721 --> 01:40.099
engraved in his memorial
was only partially written by Jefferson?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.058
[indistinct chatter]

01:41.059 --> 01:42.518
How would I know that, Rose?

01:42.519 --> 01:43.936
How do you know that?

01:43.937 --> 01:47.648
This place is just so full of history,
and we can't see it all in one day.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.527
How about we go
to the Library of Congress next?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.280
[sighing] You know this day
has to end, right?

01:55.031 --> 01:57.033
I know. It's stupid.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.911
I thought if we could keep walking,
I could make the day last longer.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.247
[Peter] So that's the plan?

02:02.747 --> 02:03.957
It was worth a shot.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.960
Okay. Let's keep walking, then.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.629
- Come on.
- Stop dragging me.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.797
[both laughing]

02:11.798 --> 02:13.174
[dramatic music playing]

02:15.385 --> 02:16.969
[music fades]

02:16.970 --> 02:17.887
[Peter] Hey.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.682
What is it? What are you thinking about?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.601
I'm sorry, I just...

02:25.603 --> 02:26.563
I like this.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.857
Us.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.776
Yeah.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.612
Yeah, me too.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.741
But this is still
all just a fantasy, right?

02:40.160 --> 02:43.245
I mean, you're getting on a plane
tomorrow to God knows where,

02:43.246 --> 02:46.248
and I'm... I'm going home.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.459
This will all just be a distant memory.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.005
- I couldn't turn down Travers.
- And I wouldn't want you to.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.510
Being a night agent is what you wanna be.
It's what you should be.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.679
It's just hard, because...

03:02.015 --> 03:04.601
the only two night agents I knew were my...

03:05.602 --> 03:06.810
[somber music playing]

03:06.811 --> 03:07.729
Yeah.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.148
I'll be careful.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.609
We only just found each other,

03:13.902 --> 03:16.445
and your whole future
is about to be classified.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.575
There are a lot of reasons
why an agent's activities are classified.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.370
The most important one is, um...

03:27.081 --> 03:29.125
Is to protect the people they love.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.088
I just wish we had more time.

03:35.924 --> 03:36.758
Yeah.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.510
You know, we, uh...

03:40.929 --> 03:42.554
We found each other once, right?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.181
[both chuckling softly]

03:44.182 --> 03:45.308
[Rose] Yeah, we did.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.895
Maybe we will again.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.357
Yeah, maybe.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.946
[opening theme music playing]

04:02.033 --> 04:03.701
[machine whirring]

04:08.206 --> 04:09.581
[sinister music playing]

04:09.582 --> 04:10.583
[air hissing]

04:16.089 --> 04:16.964
[button clicking]

04:16.965 --> 04:19.050
[air hissing]

04:20.301 --> 04:21.719
Careful, please.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.597
[door closing]

04:27.850 --> 04:29.852
[indistinct chatter]

04:36.025 --> 04:37.234
[banging on glass]

04:37.235 --> 04:38.987
That's the complete batch.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.573
We've done everything you asked.
So please, my family.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.158
You're done when we say.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.537
- Finish a batch, start a new one!
- [music fades]

04:48.121 --> 04:48.955
Now!

04:50.623 --> 04:51.623
Close those up.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.710
[indistinct chatter]

04:58.214 --> 05:00.716
Hypothetically, what would happen

05:00.717 --> 05:03.469
if these canisters
were distributed into an HVAC?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.723
Depending on the size of the system
and the number of canisters,

05:07.724 --> 05:10.643
it could spread from
the targeted building and into the city.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.980
People would suffocate in the streets.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.775
Horrific mass casualty
on a scale we haven't seen sin--

05:19.444 --> 05:22.488
We are weaponizing
a massive terror attack.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.614
I never wanted this.

05:24.615 --> 05:28.328
Foxglove was an experiment
to protect lives.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.704
- I can't mix another--
- [banging on door]

05:30.705 --> 05:31.998
Back to work!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.376
I... I have to.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.296
They have my girls. I... I have to.

05:39.505 --> 05:43.926
Well, I have a good feeling that
they would vote to stop the terrorists.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.346
We've given them 15 K.X. canisters.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.307
The damage is already done.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.352
What if we mitigated the rest?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.519
[tense music playing]

05:54.520 --> 05:56.605
Mess with the next batch somehow?

05:56.606 --> 06:00.485
If I altered the recipe slightly,
we could mix an inactive batch.

06:01.110 --> 06:04.030
- It might not look exactly like the firs--
- We have to try.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.866
How do I help?

06:08.159 --> 06:09.451
[indistinct chatter]

06:09.452 --> 06:11.662
Sure this ID will work? Looks rushed.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.205
It was rushed.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.122
[music fades]

06:14.123 --> 06:15.874
Where are you going once we get inside?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.751
Secretary general's office.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.088
- Really?
- What, is that a problem?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.506
You'll need more than a guest badge.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.800
You need credentials
on high-security floors.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.968
I'll figure something out.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.554
When you get up there,
look for Lars Troost.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.015
He's the principal advisor
to the secretary general.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.558
We've worked together before.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.395
He'll help with whatever you need
as long as he thinks you're important.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.313
[Peter] Thanks.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
[suspenseful music playing]

06:42.652 --> 06:44.654
[indistinct chatter]

06:47.615 --> 06:48.533
[panel chiming]

06:52.078 --> 06:53.496
[panel chiming]

06:54.330 --> 06:57.290
[Noor] Stay to the right
once you're at the top of the stairs.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.710
The elevators are in the back.
The rest is up to you.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.837
Okay.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.004
Good luck.

07:03.005 --> 07:03.923
[music fades]

07:04.924 --> 07:07.551
Once you're out, give Sami a call
on the phone that I gave you.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.972
He's tracking it, so he'll be close by.
He'll take you to your mother. Okay?

07:13.599 --> 07:14.434
Listen,

07:15.810 --> 07:17.436
I'm sorry I screwed things up.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.187
[dramatic music playing]

07:19.188 --> 07:20.982
I need you to know that I...

07:27.530 --> 07:28.614
Goodbye, Peter.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.032
Bye.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.413
[music fades]

07:36.414 --> 07:40.334
[in Farsi] Noor turned off the cameras
before stealing it. I already checked.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.753
[in Farsi] You just let her take it?

07:43.754 --> 07:47.340
Of course not. I tried to stop her,
but she ran out the door.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.551
I don't think I need to remind you
what happens

07:49.552 --> 07:55.308
if that list finds its way
out of regime hands.

07:56.100 --> 07:56.975
Do I?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.560
You're threatening me?

07:58.561 --> 08:02.314
This wouldn't have been a problem
if you hadn't moved it here.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.649
I told you it was secure
back in my private study.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.401
[tense music playing]

08:06.402 --> 08:07.737
[Javad seething]

08:08.613 --> 08:09.906
Insolent shrew.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.828
Did she say where she was going?

08:16.537 --> 08:19.998
No. But I have a pretty good idea.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.583
The UN building.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.002
When I've collected her,

08:24.003 --> 08:26.838
you and I will talk
with the foreign minister.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.967
You're forgetting
who governs our office, Javad.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.804
And you're forgetting
who governs our republic.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.477
Diplomats are replaced every day.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.064
You'd do well to remember that.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.861
[tense music swelling]

08:49.820 --> 08:50.820
[Haleh gasping]

08:50.821 --> 08:52.907
- [music fades]
- [indistinct chatter]

08:56.494 --> 08:59.120
- [woman] It should be in the memo.
- Noor, what are you doing here?

08:59.121 --> 09:01.748
Amélie, do you have a moment?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.209
Uh, no. Not right now.
We have a large agenda to prepare for.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.003
If you're around tomorrow, I can...

09:06.587 --> 09:07.463
Is everything okay?

09:08.422 --> 09:10.632
Here. Take it, please.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.550
What is it?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.094
It's yours. We shouldn't have it.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.515
Why are you being so cryptic?
Just tell me what's...

09:18.683 --> 09:19.558
going on.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.644
[suspenseful music playing]

09:22.728 --> 09:24.605
- Where did you get these?
- The regime.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.649
They're going to hunt down
the dissidents in France one by one.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.651
You have to protect them. All of them.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.070
They will kill you for this.

09:31.904 --> 09:32.946
I know what I'm doing.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.865
[cell phone vibrating]

09:36.367 --> 09:37.285
Sorry, I have to go.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.289
- [in Farsi] Haleh?
- Noor, Javad knows where you are.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.373
What?

09:43.374 --> 09:46.710
Javad knows where you are, Noor.
Get out of there right now.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.712
[breath shuddering]

09:50.840 --> 09:52.549
[tense music playing]

09:52.550 --> 09:53.634
[indistinct chatter]

10:00.266 --> 10:01.642
[elevator chiming]

10:02.643 --> 10:04.687
- [man] One of the delegation...
- Excuse me.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.814
[man] I'll make copies.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.025
Get it to your office.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.693
Great.

10:12.069 --> 10:12.902
[music fades]

10:12.903 --> 10:14.447
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.908
IT? Not again. Seriously?
You guys were here last week.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.744
What is it this time,
more malware updates?

10:20.745 --> 10:23.371
- I'm afraid so.
- Okay. I'll go get Carrie.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.041
- Actually, is, uh, is Lars around?
- Troost?

10:26.042 --> 10:26.958
- Yeah.
- Sure.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.794
You want to start in the big office first?

10:29.295 --> 10:32.005
That'd be great. Yeah.
And we can let Carrie take a break.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.674
- She's dealt with this enough.
- We all have. No offense.

10:34.675 --> 10:35.593
None taken.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.427
[knocking on door]

10:37.428 --> 10:39.347
Lars, IT is here.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.932
- Again? Where is Carrie?
- [woman] He wants to start in here.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.517
With the secretary general's computer.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.103
Fine, but we've got
back-to-back meetings in half an hour.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.146
Won't take me that long.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.023
- [tense music playing]
- [door closing]

10:50.024 --> 10:53.276
The IT guys are really on the clock
this week, huh?

10:53.277 --> 10:55.404
Yeah. Uh, nothing new for us.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.697
[crowd cheering, clamoring]

10:57.698 --> 11:02.494
[crowd chanting] Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

11:02.495 --> 11:04.245
[man] Come on, let's go!

11:04.246 --> 11:06.832
Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

11:08.376 --> 11:10.086
Looks like the circus is in town.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.880
Are you sure they're here?

11:13.756 --> 11:17.301
The phone they used last night connected
with the cell tower 15 minutes ago.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.636
Can't say Peter's still with her, but...

11:19.637 --> 11:21.429
If he is, let's find him.

11:21.430 --> 11:26.893
[crowd chanting] Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

11:26.894 --> 11:28.979
[suspenseful music playing]

11:32.566 --> 11:33.484
[door closing]

11:38.823 --> 11:41.867
[Wilfred] Their lack of discretion
around us is unsettling.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.497
They don't expect us to survive.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.087
- [Lars] Almost done?
- Uh, yeah. Almost.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.716
Hey, before you leave,
maybe you could help me with something?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.633
Sure.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.927
[Lars] I always get these notifications
to share my Wi-Fi

12:00.928 --> 12:02.470
with someone from another office.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.515
Of course, I decline,
but it... it keeps pinging me.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.683
Just set it there.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.435
- I'll get to it when I'm done.
- Certainly.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.395
[Peter] Thanks.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.272
[mouse scrolling]

12:12.273 --> 12:15.650
- Whoa, what-- What are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

12:15.651 --> 12:18.069
Why do you have all his files open?
What are you looking for?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.572
Hey, answer me.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.740
[Lars grunting, groaning]

12:21.741 --> 12:24.159
- I'm looking for a file.
- What kind of file?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.619
It's supposed to be on here,
but it's not, okay?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.747
That's the file number.
Does that mean anything?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.583
- Last eight digits, that's the date log.
- Yeah, I know.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.669
Then you know why it's not
on his computer. It's several years old.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.714
- You're telling me there's no copies?
- No.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.759
I am telling you it's not up here.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.679
But down in the archives, definitely,
we've got backups of everything.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.391
- How do I know you're not bullshitting me?
- I'm the one who copies everything over.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.978
Seriously, after every session, he has me
store terabytes of data down there.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.980
I know what I'm talking about.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.648
[suspenseful music playing]

12:55.649 --> 12:56.776
Great, come on.

12:57.526 --> 13:02.490
[crowd chanting] Our president,
our country! Our president, our country!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.957
Let's go! Hagan!

13:12.958 --> 13:17.170
[crowd chanting] Our president,
our country! Our president, our country!

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
[in Farsi] Drop it.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.257
Drop it or I'll break your neck.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.551
[crowd chanting in English]
Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

13:23.552 --> 13:26.971
[man] <i>America! America!</i>

13:26.972 --> 13:29.766
[crowd chanting] America! America!

13:29.767 --> 13:32.728
America! America!

13:33.312 --> 13:36.105
[man 2] Hey, watch it!
You trying to start something, asshole?

13:36.106 --> 13:37.732
- Piss off.
- What'd you say to me?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.943
- Get out of my way. Move!
- Dude, what's your problem?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.861
- Don't touch me.
- I said move.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.822
[man 2] Son, you better apologize

13:43.823 --> 13:46.241
before we turn you
into a fucking rag doll.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.494
Sir, I'm a protected member
of the diplomatic body

13:49.495 --> 13:50.912
under international law.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.664
- Allow me to pass, or else--
- [man 2] What?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.208
You gonna tell your foreign friends
we ain't being nice enough?

13:55.209 --> 13:57.794
You better humble your shithead boyfriend
before we do it for you.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.295
He's not my boyfriend.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.506
[in Farsi] Stay still, you lying bitch.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.510
- [in English] What'd he say?
- He said your mother's a dirty whore.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.095
- [man 2] Son of a bitch.
- [woman] Hey!

14:07.096 --> 14:08.471
[crowd clamoring]

14:08.472 --> 14:10.099
[all grunting]

14:11.892 --> 14:12.976
[man 2] Get him!

14:12.977 --> 14:15.271
- [men grunting]
- [Javad grunting]

14:16.188 --> 14:17.857
[woman 2] You're my hero, Hagan!

14:19.149 --> 14:20.567
- [Noor grunting]
- [woman 3] Watch it!

14:20.568 --> 14:22.278
[Noor grunting, wincing]

14:29.118 --> 14:30.035
[in Farsi] You okay?

14:31.745 --> 14:33.330
[in English] My mother, where is she?

14:33.914 --> 14:35.583
You want me to take you to her?

14:38.711 --> 14:39.628
It's up to you.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.633
[tense music playing]

14:47.761 --> 14:48.637
Careful.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.223
[Lars groaning]

14:54.226 --> 14:55.686
[door buzzing, clicking]

14:58.230 --> 15:00.231
- Not this way.
- There is no other way.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.567
There is if you wanna be able
to type 90 words per minute--

15:02.568 --> 15:04.694
Stop. Stop, it's the truth.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.906
I can get you through.
Just ease up a bit. We'll be in and out.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.532
I don't have a high pain tolerance,

15:09.533 --> 15:12.201
so trust me when I say I want this
to be over as much as you do.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.162
Okay, come on.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.179
[door buzzing, clicking]

15:31.639 --> 15:33.723
Lock him in! Lock him in!

15:33.724 --> 15:35.017
Go!

15:35.517 --> 15:37.018
Show me your hands! Hands now!

15:37.019 --> 15:37.977
No!

15:37.978 --> 15:40.022
[both grunting, straining]

15:41.440 --> 15:42.441
[guard grunting]

15:44.526 --> 15:45.693
[guard groaning]

15:45.694 --> 15:47.362
[music fades]

15:47.363 --> 15:49.281
[Lars's breath shuddering]

15:49.865 --> 15:52.284
I'm sorry.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.036
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.538
[Lars grunting]

15:57.122 --> 15:58.081
[Peter seething]

15:58.082 --> 15:59.833
[suspenseful music playing]

16:03.087 --> 16:04.505
- Which one is it?
- Uh...

16:05.339 --> 16:08.050
Uh, here. Here.
It's... it's the last bin. It's labeled.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.260
- Which row is it?
- The third one.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.263
Everything is cataloged according to date.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.317
Can... Can I go now?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.194
Yeah. Get out of here.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.076
Excuse me.

16:38.706 --> 16:43.334
[crowd chanting]
America! America! America!

16:43.335 --> 16:44.712
[music fades]

16:49.550 --> 16:50.383
Peter!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.677
[crowd chanting] America! America!

16:52.678 --> 16:54.763
[suspenseful music playing]

16:58.183 --> 17:02.729
Disperse immediately,
or you will be detained!

17:02.730 --> 17:07.818
I said, disperse immediately,
or you will be detained!

17:08.318 --> 17:10.571
This is now an unauthorized gathering!

17:11.447 --> 17:12.280
Stop.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.157
This assembly
does not have a proper permit!

17:14.158 --> 17:15.575
This way. This way.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.370
- [crowd chanting] Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!
- [officer] Disperse immediately!

17:18.996 --> 17:20.997
This gathering is unauthorized!

17:20.998 --> 17:23.082
[crowd chanting] Hagan! Hagan! Hagan!

17:23.083 --> 17:24.752
[officer] You will be detained!

17:26.003 --> 17:29.547
This assembly
does not have a proper permit!

17:29.548 --> 17:30.924
[music fades]

17:31.800 --> 17:33.426
What did Peter get himself into

17:33.427 --> 17:36.889
to have to pull protection
from a piece of shit like you?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.016
[Solomon] I don't kiss and tell.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.560
[Catherine] Yeah, a true gentleman.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.813
Up here. Just a few more feet.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.231
[car beeping]

17:50.235 --> 17:51.652
[Solomon] Get in the trunk.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.321
You need to pull that trigger right now,

17:53.322 --> 17:56.783
'cause if you don't, I'm gonna stick
that Glock so far up your ass

17:56.784 --> 17:58.451
you'll sneeze gunpowder.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.703
You ain't selling wolf tickets,
sweetheart. Time's up.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.081
- [gun firing]
- [both grunting]

18:03.499 --> 18:05.833
- [Catherine roaring]
- [Solomon grunting]

18:05.834 --> 18:08.087
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [Solomon groaning]

18:11.882 --> 18:13.509
[Catherine groaning]

18:15.636 --> 18:17.262
[tense music playing]

18:17.971 --> 18:18.971
It's working.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.808
[machine whirring]

18:23.435 --> 18:26.687
- [Markus] Where are you with batch two?
- We're filling the first canister now.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.606
No test tube to demonstrate?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.110
We're well past proof of concept.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.403
[Markus] Zann!

18:34.404 --> 18:36.365
[Gloria yelping, grunting]

18:36.990 --> 18:37.907
[Gloria] No!

18:37.908 --> 18:39.826
[Gloria continues yelping, grunting]

18:39.827 --> 18:43.871
- Gloria!
- No! Wil. We're okay. We're okay.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.291
- Don't hurt her!
- Then stop fucking around.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.461
The fluid in the vial I tested,
the stuff that worked, that was purple.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.673
Manufacturing is a delicate process.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.715
[Gloria grunting]

18:54.716 --> 18:56.801
Oh my-- No! No! No!

18:56.802 --> 19:00.055
I didn't expect to find
your research notes so compelling, doctor.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.932
You have a way with words.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.895
Like your description
of the signature purple hue of viable K.X.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.605
It's not a quick death
getting stuck in the belly.

19:09.606 --> 19:13.568
No, you have to give it time
for the stomach acids to spill out.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.862
Time for sepsis to choke the organs.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.948
More than enough time
for you to make me another batch.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.243
But if you dawdle,

19:22.244 --> 19:24.246
try to sabotage your work again,

19:25.747 --> 19:29.292
no, it will not be my time
you will be wasting, it will be hers.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.209
[weakly] No. No.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.544
- [Wilfred] Gloria!
- No!

19:31.545 --> 19:33.129
- Gloria!
- [Gloria] Wilfred!

19:33.130 --> 19:35.632
You three, stay behind with Zann and Elek.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.802
- The rest of you with me.
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.474
[tense music playing]

19:45.100 --> 19:47.143
[keypad beeping, chiming]

19:47.144 --> 19:48.478
[lock whirring, clicking]

19:57.029 --> 19:58.029
[door opening]

19:58.030 --> 19:59.322
[Abbas in Farsi] Javad.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.365
A moment, please.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.409
Now!

20:09.666 --> 20:10.833
[Abbas sighing]

20:10.834 --> 20:12.586
What are you two doing here?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.254
You should be in search of--

20:15.255 --> 20:16.840
I called them back.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.217
You called them back?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.676
- [Abbas scoffs]
- [music fades]

20:20.677 --> 20:21.969
For what?

20:21.970 --> 20:26.516
We weren't able to recover any video
from last night's theft.

20:27.142 --> 20:32.856
But we did find something else
that was rather curious...

20:34.399 --> 20:37.486
What exactly is your relationship
to the traitor, Javad?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.528
Relationship?

20:39.529 --> 20:40.822
[tense music playing]

20:41.657 --> 20:42.658
It's my job

20:43.242 --> 20:46.285
to know every member
of the staff in detail.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.205
That's all that is.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.458
Information gathering.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.834
[Abbas] Hmm.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.835
What kind of information?

20:54.836 --> 20:57.088
The same kind that lets me know
what city and street

20:57.089 --> 20:58.590
your mouthy daughter lives on.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.551
Information is leverage.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.054
And leverage

21:04.596 --> 21:11.185
is how the Islamic Republic
protects its people from temptation.

21:11.186 --> 21:14.439
You know much about temptation,

21:15.190 --> 21:16.315
don't you?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.652
Is that why you moved the list
to the mission?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.070
For Noor?

21:20.570 --> 21:23.657
Because she made you feel special?

21:24.658 --> 21:27.536
I don't have time for these idiotic games.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.955
[all grunting]

21:30.539 --> 21:31.581
[Javad straining]

21:35.544 --> 21:37.379
You accuse me...

21:39.798 --> 21:41.924
while she slips through our fingers?!

21:41.925 --> 21:45.012
I'm just gathering information.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.597
You think your word

21:49.182 --> 21:53.019
and some video clips

21:53.020 --> 21:56.064
are enough to impeach my position
to the foreign minister?

21:58.442 --> 22:01.445
I'll see you hung for this.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.864
Not just my word.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.741
There are other witnesses.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.368
Please, come.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.539
[Javad scoffing]

22:13.540 --> 22:15.166
Oh hi... What's going on?

22:15.167 --> 22:20.464
To be honest,
we're still piecing it together.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.049
But I'll tell you what it looks like.

22:23.050 --> 22:28.888
You moved highly sought-after
intelligence, disregarding my advice,

22:28.889 --> 22:30.766
to your office.

22:31.975 --> 22:36.605
Where it was subsequently stolen
by a woman you appeared quite close to.

22:37.230 --> 22:42.944
It looks like you were
working with her this whole time.

22:47.574 --> 22:53.996
People back home
have many questions for you.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.583
Inshallah, you'll have answers for them...

22:57.084 --> 22:58.376
[tense music swelling]

22:58.377 --> 22:59.544
Take him.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.677
[music fades]

23:09.096 --> 23:11.097
[dramatic music playing]

23:11.098 --> 23:12.641
[Noor sighing]

23:15.519 --> 23:16.645
[knocking on door]

23:22.234 --> 23:23.443
[in Farsi] Oh my girl!

23:24.027 --> 23:25.278
My girl!

23:26.113 --> 23:27.072
My girl!

23:28.115 --> 23:30.367
[both crying]

23:31.701 --> 23:32.786
[Azita sniffling]

23:36.164 --> 23:37.749
I can't believe you're here.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.794
Never leave me.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.464
You're all I have left.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.341
[Azita sobbing]

23:48.885 --> 23:50.887
[both sobbing]

23:55.809 --> 23:57.811
[music fades]

24:02.524 --> 24:04.109
We could end this all here.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.734
What?

24:05.735 --> 24:08.947
Ethanol and sulfuric acid
are extremely volatile together.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.534
I could seal up the exhaust vent
to speed the reaction

24:13.034 --> 24:16.204
and contain the fire in here, with us.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.080
You'd burn us alive.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.499
[Wilfred chuckling softly]

24:20.000 --> 24:22.919
[whispering] There's no way
they let any of us live.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.629
There are other people with my skill set,

24:25.630 --> 24:29.092
but this lab and those chemicals
are unique to K.X.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.386
We can't change what we've done.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.638
But if we forfeit our lives
to destroy this lab,

24:34.639 --> 24:37.100
we might prevent it
from happening in the future.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.228
No. We're not done fighting.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.354
[banging on glass]

24:42.355 --> 24:44.191
Less talking, more working!

24:48.111 --> 24:49.988
[tense music playing]

24:51.156 --> 24:53.241
There's only five guys watching us.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.913
With what we have, could you make
something before Markus gets here?

24:58.413 --> 25:01.916
Something toxic, airborne?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.210
Like a knockout gas?

25:03.919 --> 25:04.753
Yeah.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.007
[indistinct chatter]

25:11.468 --> 25:12.384
[music fades]

25:12.385 --> 25:13.637
[door closing]

25:17.140 --> 25:20.435
[Markus breathing deeply, exhaling]

25:24.064 --> 25:24.898
Uncle.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.859
<i>Hello? Uncle Viktor?</i>

25:28.360 --> 25:29.652
I was expecting Tomás.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.321
I came in his place.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.657
There were some complications.

25:34.658 --> 25:35.658
Complications?

25:35.659 --> 25:37.076
[exhaling]

25:37.077 --> 25:38.328
He betrayed us.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.580
Betrayed you.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.958
<i>I did what needed to be done.</i>

25:45.335 --> 25:47.127
<i>He went quick. I made sure of it.</i>

25:47.128 --> 25:49.214
[sinister music playing]

25:49.923 --> 25:51.174
Tomás...

25:51.716 --> 25:53.009
[Viktor breathing deeply]

25:53.510 --> 25:54.970
So much promise.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.308
I will mourn the boy he was,
but less the man he grew to be.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.893
There was no other way. I'm sorry.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.813
Tell me, was his sacrifice enough
to keep our plan intact?

26:05.814 --> 26:07.065
Ready to go.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.650
On your order.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.486
- On my order? [chuckling]
- [Markus] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

26:13.238 --> 26:15.532
The Western world thinks us savages,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.619
and yet they peddle
the very instrument of that savagery.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.413
<i>It's time, Markus.</i>

26:22.914 --> 26:25.750
Make me proud, my son.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.087
<i>Show them the pain they have wrought.</i>

26:32.674 --> 26:34.676
[siren wailing in distance]

26:36.761 --> 26:37.679
[gears shifting]

26:42.225 --> 26:43.935
[suspenseful music playing]

26:47.439 --> 26:48.440
I'm clean.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.442
You wanna trust him on that?

27:10.879 --> 27:11.796
Take a seat.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.717
[door whirring closed]

27:16.676 --> 27:18.637
[tramway whirring]

27:20.680 --> 27:22.682
[suspenseful music continues]

27:24.309 --> 27:25.851
I assessed you as a safe bet.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.894
Where's Rose?

27:26.895 --> 27:28.355
Goods first,

27:29.147 --> 27:30.231
then services.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.484
What am I handing to you?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.694
A little late for curiosity, isn't it?

27:35.695 --> 27:39.658
I need to know that I'm not giving you
Foxglove or endangering people's lives.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.744
You're inches from the goal, Peter.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.247
Don't choke this late in the game.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.669
Just hand over the case file,
then you can run off and save your damsel.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.714
[tramway powering down]

27:56.966 --> 27:58.426
[music fades]

27:59.302 --> 28:01.805
This is an ICC criminal case file, right?

28:02.847 --> 28:03.682
About who?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.393
What's this trade worth to you?

28:07.727 --> 28:09.688
His name is Viktor Bala.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.777
He's a war criminal
being held at The Hague,

28:16.778 --> 28:20.447
convicted of using Foxglove compound K.X.
on his own people.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.741
Claims the Americans sold it to him.

28:22.742 --> 28:23.659
That's bullshit.

28:23.660 --> 28:28.372
Well, there was no corroborating evidence,
so the ICC dismissed U.S. involvement.

28:28.373 --> 28:33.252
It would take someone very high up
in the ICC or the UN

28:33.253 --> 28:35.421
to tamper with that investigation.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.674
- The secretary general?
- [man] Yeah.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.343
Now, if there's any credibility
to what Viktor claims,

28:41.344 --> 28:44.556
then it is your duty to expose it. Yes?

28:45.390 --> 28:48.059
Start by sharing that truth with me.

28:48.810 --> 28:52.147
- What are you gonna do with it?
- You've already paid for this deal.

28:52.647 --> 28:56.359
Your face and fingerprints
are all over this UN intel leak.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.195
Don't make your sacrifice meaningless.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.865
[dramatic music playing]

29:09.789 --> 29:12.791
The file you requested
doesn't exist on his current computer,

29:12.792 --> 29:17.130
but that drive has monthly backups
from 2018, the year you requested.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.339
If he downloaded the file to delete it--

29:19.340 --> 29:20.550
And here it is.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.053
Along with the contents
of his entire computer.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.056
Above and beyond.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.934
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.936
No, it just cost me my face and my prints.

29:32.937 --> 29:33.937
[man exclaiming]

29:33.938 --> 29:35.606
Be wiped clean by the morning.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.691
- I protect my sources.
- [Peter scoffing]

29:37.692 --> 29:41.321
[man] Unlike Russia,
or even the FBI, I hear.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.322
You were quick to give up Bala.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.825
He's been a problematic client.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.369
Exposed me to unnecessary risks.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.290
And some sources
are more valuable than others.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.541
Consider it a compliment.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.961
If you already had an in at the UN,
why send me?

29:57.962 --> 30:00.673
Well, I can never resist
a two-for-one deal.

30:02.050 --> 30:07.055
High-security intel
and a inside man at Night Action?

30:08.139 --> 30:09.766
That is what it's called, right?

30:10.725 --> 30:13.937
Ah, don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

30:15.730 --> 30:16.898
On one condition.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.862
When I call, you answer.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.743
I hear Sutherland Sr.
knew when to make a deal.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.662
Understood value.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.372
That's in your blood.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.791
Own it.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.126
Trust it.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.548
Your life for hers, right?

30:49.889 --> 30:53.476
- Where is she?
- Vandervoort and Jackson, Brooklyn.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.435
Old meatpacking warehouse.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.771
Viktor Bala's men took her, right?

30:57.772 --> 31:00.482
Yes. Led by his son.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.693
What are they planning on doing
with the K.X.?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.529
Well, that's for you to find out.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.365
[tramway whirring]

31:19.002 --> 31:20.377
[camera shutter clicking]

31:20.378 --> 31:22.462
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

31:22.463 --> 31:24.215
[music fades]

31:26.175 --> 31:27.135
[Aiden] Your doing?

31:28.052 --> 31:29.137
He started it.

31:30.013 --> 31:30.972
And Sutherland?

31:31.890 --> 31:35.143
I lost him outside the UN.
Big guy intervened.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.394
So they were working together?

31:37.395 --> 31:38.729
[camera shutter clicking]

31:38.730 --> 31:40.814
[cell phone vibrating]

31:40.815 --> 31:42.901
[suspenseful music playing]

31:43.401 --> 31:44.234
[Catherine] <i>Yes?</i>

31:44.235 --> 31:46.695
- Vandervoort and Jackson, Brooklyn.
- [Catherine] <i>Peter.</i>

31:46.696 --> 31:49.323
That's where they're keeping Rose
in an old meatpacking warehouse.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.240
And the K.X.?

31:50.241 --> 31:52.367
- [Peter] <i>And the K.X.</i>
- Who? How do you know?

31:52.368 --> 31:54.037
Meet me there. I'll explain everything.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.009
[both coughing]

32:09.010 --> 32:10.052
[Elek] Guys?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.387
Guys? Are you all right?

32:12.388 --> 32:13.347
Shit.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.308
[men continue coughing]

32:16.184 --> 32:17.100
[door opening]

32:17.101 --> 32:18.937
[Elek] Help! Help!

32:19.562 --> 32:20.771
I need help!

32:20.772 --> 32:21.856
Help!

32:22.941 --> 32:24.150
[Elek grunting]

32:25.401 --> 32:27.904
[Elek coughing, gasping]

32:34.702 --> 32:36.411
[Wilfred] Come on! They're this way!

32:36.412 --> 32:38.498
[suspenseful music playing]

32:50.551 --> 32:52.928
- [Wilfred] That's Tomás.
- [Rose] That's what K.X. does?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.138
[Wilfred] Only ten milliliters of it.

32:55.139 --> 32:58.518
Our first batch armed them
with 20,000 times that amount.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.604
- Jesse. Look at me.
- [Jesse shuddering]

33:02.605 --> 33:03.814
It's okay.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.731
- I'm--
- [door opening]

33:04.732 --> 33:06.358
- No!
- [Wilfred] Hey.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.694
- You're okay.
- You came for us!

33:08.695 --> 33:10.112
- Of course.
- [Rose] We gotta move.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.780
There's still two guys in the warehouse.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.782
[Wilfred] Do not take off the mask.
Got it?

33:13.783 --> 33:14.825
Let me carry you.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.910
[Gloria] No. Wil, you get our baby out.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.745
- [Wilfred] Okay.
- [Rose] I got her. Come on.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.455
- Okay.
- [Rose] We're right behind you. Go.

33:20.456 --> 33:21.498
Go.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.750
- Go!
- [Jesse] Yeah.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.753
[Rose] Okay, here. Here.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.422
Come on.

Hey!

33:36.389 --> 33:37.431
[Rose] Get her out of here!

34:00.455 --> 34:03.499
[Gloria] Oh God! No!

34:31.486 --> 34:32.945
[Wilfred] Barricade the door!

34:33.654 --> 34:34.530
[Jesse] Help me!

34:38.409 --> 34:39.243

[Zann grunting]

34:47.710 --> 34:48.836
[door crashing]

34:54.801 --> 34:56.177
Go. Call for help.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.804
But what about you?

34:59.263 --> 35:01.349
Be brave, bunny. I'm getting your mom.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.352
[Jesse panting]

35:07.313 --> 35:08.773
- [Peter] Hey!
- [Jesse gasping]

35:09.774 --> 35:12.025
Hey, I'm FBI. I'm here to help.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.945
- My parents, they're inside.
- And a woman? Rose?

35:14.946 --> 35:18.449
With my mom. Please you have to--
Take this! Don't take it off inside.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.828
Okay. Go up the street, get out of sight,
don't come out till the cops get here.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.956
Please... save my parents.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.335

35:35.466 --> 35:37.468

35:39.470 --> 35:40.388
[Zann] Come here.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.140
[both women grunting]

35:43.141 --> 35:44.851
- [Zann grunting]

36:47.371 --> 36:48.955
[Wilfred] Jesse's outside getting help.

36:48.956 --> 36:51.082
Go down the hall and to the right.
Then we can--

36:51.083 --> 36:53.460
- Oh God! I'm sorry.
- [Rose] Let me help. Come on.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.712
- Come on. I can go in--
- [Wilfred] Go, go, go!

[Wilfred panting, groaning]

37:15.691 --> 37:18.778
[Rose] Okay, help's on the way.
We just need to hold on, okay?

37:22.031 --> 37:24.033
[Peter panting]

37:30.539 --> 37:32.083
[Rose] Hide in here. Quickly.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.212
- [Gloria shuddering]
- [Rose whispering] It's okay.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.139
- [door slams]
- [Gloria gasping]

37:48.057 --> 37:49.475
[footsteps approaching]

37:50.476 --> 37:51.310
[both screaming]

37:53.104 --> 37:53.980
[Rose] Peter.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.151
[Rose] It's gonna be okay.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.242
[tense music playing]

38:12.373 --> 38:13.499
[both grunting]

38:18.921 --> 38:19.880
[Peter grunting]

38:22.258 --> 38:23.300
[Peter grunting]

38:23.301 --> 38:24.635
[both straining]

38:28.180 --> 38:29.974
[both straining]

38:34.854 --> 38:36.856
[man coughing]

38:39.984 --> 38:41.067
[music fades]

38:41.068 --> 38:42.944
[both panting]

38:42.945 --> 38:44.030
[Rose] Are you okay?

38:45.323 --> 38:46.449
[Peter] Yeah. You?

38:46.949 --> 38:47.825
[Rose] Uh-huh.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.123
[sirens wailing]

38:55.124 --> 38:57.042
[officers shouting indistinctly]

38:57.043 --> 38:59.295
- [officer 1] Show your hands!
- [officer 2] On your knees!

38:59.795 --> 39:01.546
- Down on your knees!
- Stay down!

39:01.547 --> 39:04.174
[officer 3] Get down on your knees
and show us your hands!

39:04.175 --> 39:05.133
[officers shouting]

39:05.134 --> 39:07.762
Stand down! They're with us.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.347
- [Jesse] Mom!
- [Gloria] Jesse!

39:10.348 --> 39:11.306
Oh baby!

39:11.307 --> 39:13.016
[officer 1] Nobody goes in without a mask.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.185
[officer 2] Copy that!

39:14.769 --> 39:16.686
- What happened here?
- They have it.

39:16.687 --> 39:20.023
- K.X.? You two made it for them?
- They had Dr. Cole's family.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.693
This guy, Tomás Bala,
tried to help sabotage it, but...

39:23.694 --> 39:25.820
Tomás Bala? Viktor Bala's son?

39:25.821 --> 39:30.283
Wait, hold on. Viktor Bala, the dictator,
his son has something to do with this?

39:30.284 --> 39:34.662
Had. His cousin Markus killed him
with a tiny vial of K.X.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.332
His body's in the fridge.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.835
- What happened to everyone else?
- Markus and his men left hours ago.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.796
They took a batch of canisters with them.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.841
- Where are they?
- The UN. I found their uniforms.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.427
Viktor Bala claims America
sold him completed K.X.

39:49.428 --> 39:53.057
Okay? He blames the UN
for covering up America's involvement.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.142
We gave them 15 canisters of K.X.

39:56.143 --> 39:59.187
That's enough poison
to wipe out Midtown Manhattan.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.273
[suspenseful music swelling]

40:02.900 --> 40:04.902
[sinister music playing]

40:28.300 --> 40:29.801
[cases clattering]

40:29.802 --> 40:30.719
Load them in.

40:36.183 --> 40:37.518
[sinister music swelling]

40:38.561 --> 40:39.645
[music fades]

40:40.604 --> 40:42.606
[ending theme music playing]
