WEBVTT

00:36.369 --> 00:37.495
Right.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.497
I knew Mr. Yang

00:40.457 --> 00:42.333
would send you.

00:44.377 --> 00:48.214
I'm handing them over
for your sake, Tae-gu.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.258
Had you not come,

00:50.800 --> 00:53.511
they'd already be
six feet under in cement.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.763
You hear?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.850
That'd be fucking epic.

00:58.933 --> 00:59.976
Good day, boss.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.227
-Sir.
-Afternoon, boss.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.271
Where are Yang's boys?

01:03.354 --> 01:04.522
Over there, sir.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.616
AGAINST DEMOLITION AND NEW CONDOS

01:14.699 --> 01:16.034
<i>So what then?</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:22.874
Should I relay that message to my don?

01:25.668 --> 01:26.961
I don't give a shit.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.296
Tell him what you like.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.993
<i>Let's hear it.</i>

02:00.662 --> 02:03.498
What's done is done.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.416
Why did you do it?

02:06.292 --> 02:09.087
Why did you turn on us out of the blue?

02:10.380 --> 02:13.174
What's the point of asking?
You know how it is.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.552
That's how it goes around here.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.469
Tae-gu.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.722
Have you heard of the saying,

02:20.390 --> 02:22.100
<i>dangranggeocheol</i>?

02:22.851 --> 02:24.102
<i>Dangranggeocheol</i>.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.856
Don't use big words, it's not like you.

02:29.774 --> 02:33.945
A big ass wheel rolls down,

02:34.737 --> 02:39.117
and a tiny mantis tries to stop it
down the path.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.121
Fucking hell.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.374
That mantis sure got grit.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.669
But what's the inevitable result?

02:51.462 --> 02:53.423
Listen carefully, young one.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.135
What are you even doing?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.429
You really think you can put up a fight

02:59.512 --> 03:00.972
against the Bukseong clan?

03:01.055 --> 03:04.350
I understand Yang's trying to
raise his reputation,

03:04.434 --> 03:07.770
but what do you have to gain?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.439
From what I hear,

03:09.522 --> 03:13.109
Bukseong's Chairman Doh made you an offer,

03:13.192 --> 03:14.569
but you told him to piss off.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.195
You got some balls.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.531
Is life too boring?

03:23.077 --> 03:24.704
Watch out for yourself.

03:25.204 --> 03:29.375
Chairman Doh let it slide
because he values people,

03:29.459 --> 03:31.210
but I'd have killed you first.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.505
To be frank, without you,

03:35.465 --> 03:36.633
Yang's a fucking cripple.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.344
I'll make sure to relay your words.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.055
Yes, do what you will.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.140
Take care.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.996
19 is coming up, we're at level 3 now.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.256
It's raining.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.051
You sure came early.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.344
Look at the time!

04:21.427 --> 04:24.055
You sure came early, look at the time!

04:24.138 --> 04:25.807
Uncle, can't you read time?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.517
Ji-eun, I'm sorry,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.352
I was super busy and lost track of time.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.145
-Sorry.
-Golly.

04:31.896 --> 04:35.358
Jae-kyung, are you hungry?
There's a good <i>mulhoe</i> place nearby.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.654
I'm the sick one here,
yet you want your favorite dish?

04:39.737 --> 04:43.408
They got great abalone porridge.
That's what you should be having, right?

04:43.491 --> 04:46.035
What happened to your face?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.787
-Why?
-Look at you.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.038
You look so tired.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.748
I'm not tired at all.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.916
It's not like you do anything important.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.836
Don't gangsters fool around
and lounge all day?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.921
Why do you look so haggard?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.090
Sweetie.

04:59.173 --> 05:02.343
-Tell Mom to nag on the microphone.
-Stop changing the subject.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.262
Aren't you even embarrassed?

05:04.345 --> 05:08.558
At least stop saying
you'll quit that life, and just do it.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.892
When I'm dead,

05:09.976 --> 05:11.686
you're her only next of kin.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.272
What will happen to her
if you get stabbed somewhere?

05:14.355 --> 05:15.940
Why are you saying that in front of her?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.775
You think kids are oblivious?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.152
They know.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.486
Jeez.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.908
What do you know? Don't listen to her.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.868
Jae-kyung!

05:28.870 --> 05:29.954
Hop in.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.041
I'll get your prescription filled
and bring them over later.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.585
Sweetie, I'll come by later,

05:35.668 --> 05:38.296
so get home with mommy, okay?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.841
Uncle, promise me you'll come later, okay?

05:41.924 --> 05:45.887
Don't get stabbed, Uncle, it really hurts.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.936
Okay, sweetie.
I'll come by later, promise.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.813
-Promise, seal it.
-Sealing!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.732
What's coming up in a few days?

05:57.815 --> 05:58.816
My birthday!

05:58.900 --> 06:02.111
I already bought you a gift,
it's in the car.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.280
Gift? Mine?

06:04.363 --> 06:05.448
Right there!

06:05.531 --> 06:07.116
You must be so happy!

06:07.200 --> 06:09.077
What is it? What did you buy her?

06:09.160 --> 06:09.994
Ji-eun, open it.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.038
Thank your uncle, honey.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.122
Ji-eun, are you happy?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.208
-Can you move? Let me get in.
-What? Hold on.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.210
-Let me get in.
-What could be inside?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.797
-Tada!
-Why are you so damn strong?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.883
I'll prep some food,
so pick them up later.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.885
It's an iPad!

06:25.968 --> 06:28.304
Do you like it? You can watch
<i>Mini Mini</i> everyday with it…

06:28.387 --> 06:30.515
-All right, that's enough.
-Do you love it?

06:30.598 --> 06:34.143
Christ, you're being way too clingy!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.520
Drive carefully in the rain.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.773
-Ji-eun, look at Uncle.
-Ji-eun!

06:38.856 --> 06:39.816
I bought you that!

06:41.567 --> 06:43.111
I'll see you later, sweetie!

06:52.245 --> 06:53.079
Bye!

06:54.080 --> 06:55.081
Ji-eun!

07:07.218 --> 07:08.344
I'll get us a cab, sir.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.265
No, head back to the office first.
I got something to do here.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.975
I can accompany you.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.894
I gotta fill my sister's prescription,

07:16.978 --> 07:19.105
and something else too,
so you head on back.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.488
Go ahead.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.449
I'll see you back, sir!

07:33.244 --> 07:37.415
After a thorough exam, we concluded that

07:39.041 --> 07:41.085
you're not an eligible donor
for your sister.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.798
You two are very incompatible,

07:46.757 --> 07:50.136
family members aren't
normally this incompatible.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.723
Right, she's

07:54.348 --> 07:55.600
my half sister.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.020
I see.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.359
Doctor.

08:06.944 --> 08:07.945
How long…

08:08.905 --> 08:10.573
does she have?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.781
Hey, what's up?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.744
No.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.456
It's okay, I don't need to have <i>mulhoe</i>.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.999
I was just saying that.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.962
I'm really okay, what's with you today?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.299
Hello?

09:12.343 --> 09:13.386
Jae-kyung?

09:18.307 --> 09:19.308
Hello?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.521
Jae-kyung?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.898
You there?

10:35.051 --> 10:36.302
The don is here, sir.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.097
Did you get some sleep?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.225
Have you eaten?

11:25.851 --> 11:26.727
Yes, sir.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.813
Wasn't today

11:31.023 --> 11:32.733
supposed to be Ji-eun's birthday?

11:35.486 --> 11:38.656
Chairman Doh really did it this time.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.242
He must've lost his mind.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.121
Even if things are bad between our clans,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.207
he crossed the line.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.754
He was drooling
to recruit you at one point.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.892
What am I supposed to do?

12:08.436 --> 12:12.398
They're already gunning for our necks
at every chance.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.567
As your boss,

12:16.861 --> 12:18.612
there isn't anything I can do to help.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.631
I'll go see Chairman Doh.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.639
And do what?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.767
What would you like me to do?

12:50.853 --> 12:53.439
Isn't that what you want too?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.568
We're at a point of no return.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.304
My condolences to your sister and niece.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.974
I was shocked to hear what happened.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.770
Even if we lead less than ideal lives,

13:33.854 --> 13:37.525
only the lowest of lowlives
go after our families.

13:37.608 --> 13:41.612
These punks really
fucked things up this time.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.911
I'll get to the bottom of this,

13:50.162 --> 13:51.830
and toss the perp to you.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.957
This I promise you.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.298
It's all in the past now.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.135
What's the use at this point?

14:09.139 --> 14:12.309
Since it wasn't your order,
I'll accept it as an accident.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.727
All right.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.813
Good.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.067
I like how thoughtful you are.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.279
I feel bad for your family,
but as a gesture of consolation,

14:24.613 --> 14:26.073
is there anything you want?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.158
What can I do for you?

14:29.493 --> 14:32.037
Isn't that why you wanted this meet?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.707
Did you have something in mind?

14:38.335 --> 14:40.880
I'll go splash some cold water first.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.716
Very well.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.431
Easy.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.444
Don't be so jumpy.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.697
We're all naked here,
what's there to worry?

15:06.780 --> 15:08.782
You're being too petty.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.159
My apologies, Chairman.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.243
Fine, whatever.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.454
Just flip that hourglass.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.596
Come here.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.565
-What the…
-Goddamn…

16:26.777 --> 16:28.779
Tae-gu, hold on…

16:28.862 --> 16:30.572
Tae-gu, please! Hold on a sec!

18:12.257 --> 18:13.258
Here.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.557
You did good.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.560
Were you injured?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.479
I'm fine, boss.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.037
Did you dispose of your phone properly?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.540
Use that for the time being,

18:45.374 --> 18:48.001
I quickly put together
a new ID and some money.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.170
First thing…

18:54.716 --> 18:55.634
get to Jeju Island.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.427
A week should do.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.972
Then you'll hop on a ship to Russia

19:00.055 --> 19:01.515
and reach Vladivostok.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.393
Russia should be safer than China,

19:05.060 --> 19:08.188
since the Bukseong clan has
close affiliation with the Chinese.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.690
I don’t care where I go, boss.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.025
Tae-gu.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.402
Yes, boss.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.530
You saved us all.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.953
Shall we?

19:26.957 --> 19:28.625
A week at the most.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.962
Enjoy the scenery and fresh air,

19:32.713 --> 19:34.798
think of this as your vacation.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.259
Yes, sir.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.932
Get going.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.327
Did you have a chat with Kuto in Jeju?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.078
Yes, boss, it's been taken care of.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.038
And the boys?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.206
Give them a call.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.410
<i>Is this Mr. Park Tae-gu?</i>

21:29.538 --> 21:31.248
Yes, who is this?

21:31.331 --> 21:34.584
Your chauffeur, probably.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.211
Bingo.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.800
My uncle's tied up with work,
so I came instead.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.677
Follow me.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.767
Come on.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.352
Not coming?

21:52.936 --> 21:53.812
Coming.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.090
Come on…

22:32.559 --> 22:34.352
It's really windy today.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.662
This is a Tokarev,
a Russian-made, not Chinese.

22:54.456 --> 22:58.293
And a box of ammo.
I'll provide more if you need it.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.128
Fucking A.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.672
All these for that price?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.591
You're okay with dumping?

23:04.674 --> 23:08.053
If Bukseong or the Russians find out,
they won't be too happy.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.179
Are you buying or not?

23:09.262 --> 23:10.931
Of course I'm buying.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.308
The Japanese boys are desperate for these.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.060
Kuto.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.313
Do you know how hard it was

23:18.396 --> 23:21.650
to put together US dollars
during this global recession?

23:22.275 --> 23:24.236
Strip them and wrap them up.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.072
Back in the fish guts?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.323
Is there another way?

23:28.406 --> 23:29.282
If you want,

23:29.908 --> 23:32.452
you can have them by airmail.
You can pick them up at the airport.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.205
It's not that, but the stench is…

23:36.039 --> 23:37.541
Shut your hole and pack 'em.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.209
Fishing boats are the safest bet.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.087
Give me a smoke.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.924
By the way,

23:46.007 --> 23:48.510
why do you need cash so badly?

23:49.511 --> 23:53.306
I hear you're dealing directly instead of
going through us or the Russians.

23:54.141 --> 23:54.975
Yes?

23:56.226 --> 23:58.228
Are you putting together
a retirement fund?

24:00.897 --> 24:02.566
If you're done shopping, you may go.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.234
It's closing time.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.243
What are you looking around for?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.494
Dig in.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.205
Of course.

25:00.498 --> 25:01.917
I was told that

25:02.000 --> 25:05.420
you moved here to work on the farm.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.256
How long will you stay?

25:10.884 --> 25:12.677
About a week,

25:14.429 --> 25:15.889
but I'm not sure.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.266
Where's your next stop?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.768
Vladivostok.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.311
Vladivostok?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.063
Sounds grand.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.857
And become an independence fighter?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.740
Are you done?

25:33.823 --> 25:34.908
Wait…

25:36.159 --> 25:37.661
A week at the most,

25:38.411 --> 25:39.704
earlier the better.

25:41.748 --> 25:45.085
We don't like getting mixed up
with you people over a few bucks.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.406
<i>Please leave a message after the tone…</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:11.921
How did it go?

27:13.381 --> 27:14.632
Chief Ma…

27:15.467 --> 27:16.760
slipped through our fingers.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.932
Motherfuckers!

27:23.808 --> 27:26.478
He's the most important target!

27:28.021 --> 27:28.897
Son of a…

27:28.980 --> 27:29.939
I'm sorry, sir.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.911
Also, boss,

27:43.995 --> 27:45.747
Bukseong's Chairman Doh is…

27:47.665 --> 27:50.168
still breathing.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.504
He's in surgery now.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.235
It's Bukseong's Chief Ma.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.462
Hello?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.881
Mr. Yang.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.511
You really made a mess this time.

28:43.430 --> 28:47.475
Fuck, this really caught me off guard.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.145
By an incompetent hooligan, no less.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.443
Listen, Mr. Yang.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.529
You son of a bitch.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.782
I don't know what you took

29:02.866 --> 29:05.869
to suddenly grow an extra pair of balls,

29:07.078 --> 29:08.288
but just you wait.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.915
I'm gonna cut you up alive

29:11.458 --> 29:14.711
and take a look inside for myself.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.672
You hear?

29:18.840 --> 29:19.883
Just wait.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.384
It won't be long.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.849
Where are those bastards right now?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.843
Give me that.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.311
Too many men are getting fucked

30:15.063 --> 30:17.690
because of one chicken shit.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.528
Bite down hard.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.196
This will hurt.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.462
Hey!

32:03.546 --> 32:04.422
Wait!

32:04.505 --> 32:05.465
Hey!

32:06.174 --> 32:07.258
Hold it!

32:07.342 --> 32:09.510
Hey, wait a minute!

32:10.678 --> 32:12.180
Hey…

32:12.263 --> 32:13.723
Wait…

32:15.058 --> 32:16.267
What's going on?

32:17.518 --> 32:18.561
What are you doing?

32:19.687 --> 32:20.772
Stop kidding around, okay?

32:20.855 --> 32:22.148
Don't do that.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.317
Easy, easy.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.196
Please calm down.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.113
Hold on.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.031
Don't, please.

32:30.114 --> 32:30.990
Please…

32:31.074 --> 32:32.241
Wait…

32:32.325 --> 32:33.868
Easy…

32:33.952 --> 32:35.328
Please, I won't come near.

32:35.411 --> 32:36.704
I said don't!

32:36.788 --> 32:37.664
Stop!

32:50.885 --> 32:52.303
Is she nuts?

33:36.889 --> 33:40.226
Fuck, I just had my lunch…

33:40.893 --> 33:42.061
Put that away.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.897
Jeez…

33:52.196 --> 33:53.031
Mr. Yang.

33:53.114 --> 33:53.990
Yes?

33:54.657 --> 33:58.494
What the hell are you all doing?

33:59.203 --> 34:01.497
Are you shooting a movie or something?

34:02.623 --> 34:03.541
My apologies.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.752
Jeez…

34:05.835 --> 34:07.962
I'm sorry, Captain Park, I really am.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.631
Please help me out just once.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.092
What am I, Your Lord and Savior?

34:13.801 --> 34:17.597
Why did you start a war you can't end?

34:18.848 --> 34:20.224
Fuck…

34:21.809 --> 34:24.145
This isn't like back in the '80s.

34:24.771 --> 34:28.608
We're living in the 21st Century.
Why are you so old-fashioned?

34:29.984 --> 34:30.943
Man…

34:37.366 --> 34:39.535
Chief Ma, it's me.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.454
It's been a while.

34:41.537 --> 34:44.665
Anyway, it's time to have a face-to-face.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.752
How about lunch?
Preferably something good.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.546
Christ.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.882
Do you even need to ask who's buying?

36:32.690 --> 36:33.566
What the hell?

36:37.820 --> 36:39.155
Miss?

36:40.323 --> 36:41.532
What's wrong?

36:45.745 --> 36:47.371
Goddammit…

36:47.455 --> 36:48.414
Move!

36:50.082 --> 36:51.709
-Sir, what are you doing?
-Take the wheel.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.878
-What?
-Drive, asshole!

36:55.379 --> 36:56.214
But…

37:02.261 --> 37:03.387
Get to the hospital!

37:03.971 --> 37:04.972
Jae-yeon, honey!

37:52.603 --> 37:54.897
You drank that.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.901
I didn't touch it yet.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.710
Has Mr. Yang called you yet?

38:16.794 --> 38:18.379
When is he picking you up?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.549
Early next week.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.970
All right, that's good.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.432
He owes me for taking you in.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.070
We're leaving soon too.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.576
Where will you go?

38:49.243 --> 38:52.955
I'm taking her to the States for surgery.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.003
The chance of recovery
is under ten percent here,

39:00.046 --> 39:03.049
but it's close to 20% over there.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.890
At this rate,

39:13.059 --> 39:15.269
she won't last a month here.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.630
Did you even wash up?

39:45.674 --> 39:47.301
No, I didn't get to.

39:50.846 --> 39:51.847
Why?

39:53.849 --> 39:55.559
Does it show?

39:57.978 --> 40:00.356
Disgusting pig…

40:13.536 --> 40:15.871
Come on, Captain Park,

40:16.664 --> 40:18.749
we came all this way

40:18.833 --> 40:21.627
only to have <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

40:21.710 --> 40:23.045
You know I'm buying,

40:23.671 --> 40:25.047
I got a reputation to uphold.

40:25.131 --> 40:28.217
A government official mustn't
live so lavishly.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.052
It could be misconstrued as a bribe.

40:30.719 --> 40:32.012
Pass me the vinegar.

40:32.096 --> 40:32.972
Sure.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.442
Aren't you having some?

40:44.525 --> 40:46.110
Let him be.

40:46.193 --> 40:50.322
Stuffing his stomach will only
make a mess when cutting him open.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.490
That's a good boy.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.784
Don't even have a bite.

40:53.868 --> 40:56.620
You sure got a savage tongue.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.080
All right then,

40:58.164 --> 41:00.207
since you don't have an appetite,

41:00.958 --> 41:02.334
let's get to business.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.337
So, I hear Chairman Doh is awake.

41:05.921 --> 41:06.881
What's the use?

41:06.964 --> 41:09.884
He's a fucking cripple now.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.386
The silver lining was,

41:12.470 --> 41:16.307
he was a devoted church goer,
who made a ton of donations,

41:17.057 --> 41:19.602
so he had the Lord watching over him.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.812
Fucking Hallelujah.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.273
Screw that, the doctors saved him.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.610
In any case,

41:28.360 --> 41:30.488
he's back from the dead,

41:31.280 --> 41:34.408
and I hear you managed to
send a few of Mr. Yang's men

41:34.492 --> 41:36.494
to the Lord's pearly gates.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.787
I'd say Bukseong did enough damage, no?

41:39.705 --> 41:41.123
Why don't you two

41:42.583 --> 41:43.667
call truce at this point?

41:44.627 --> 41:49.340
Come on now, that ain't right.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.468
Your math is all wrong.

41:53.135 --> 41:57.056
This can't be wrapped up
with simple arithmetics.

41:58.682 --> 41:59.892
To be frank,

42:02.770 --> 42:04.647
you people started this incident.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.482
What? "You people"?

42:07.608 --> 42:11.111
You got a mouth that's ripe for ripping,

42:11.195 --> 42:12.571
you fucking nobody.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.449
Chief Ma, don't be like that.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.451
Let's all be civil and clear this up

42:17.535 --> 42:19.411
for my sake, okay?

42:19.495 --> 42:22.122
If you keep stirring up trouble,
you'll put me in the spot.

42:23.457 --> 42:26.752
I got my ass handed to me
before coming here,

42:27.378 --> 42:29.672
for being too lenient on fucking thugs.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.634
My evaluation is around the corner too.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.512
Which is why

42:37.638 --> 42:40.432
we should take it down a notch. All right?

42:46.730 --> 42:48.023
Listen, Mr. Park.

42:50.484 --> 42:54.196
You can't force a truce in this case.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.699
My boss was jumped.

42:56.782 --> 42:59.076
The don of Bukseong

42:59.159 --> 43:01.829
was almost assassinated
by these third-rate thugs.

43:01.912 --> 43:02.746
So,

43:03.664 --> 43:07.209
does it look like we can
gloss over it haphazardly?

43:08.419 --> 43:11.463
I'm so fucking embarrassed

43:11.547 --> 43:13.716
that I can't lift my head in public!

43:13.799 --> 43:15.301
Fucking hell…

43:16.594 --> 43:18.887
God-fucking-damn…

43:22.725 --> 43:25.019
Motherfucker.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.230
Hey, Ma Sang-gil.

43:29.857 --> 43:30.691
So what?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.320
How far will you go then?

43:34.987 --> 43:37.364
-Captain Park…
-Shut the fuck up, dick cheese,

43:37.448 --> 43:39.074
I'm holding court here!

43:44.079 --> 43:45.080
Buddy.

43:47.249 --> 43:48.292
You must think

43:49.543 --> 43:51.503
that since we're sharing a meal,

43:51.587 --> 43:53.922
we're buddies or something.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.216
BFF and shit, right?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.343
Listen.

43:57.426 --> 43:58.719
Despite all that,

43:58.802 --> 44:00.763
there's a hard cap to my patience.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.933
I just told you
my evaluation is coming up.

44:05.017 --> 44:09.229
If I don't get my promotion,
who's gonna take the heat?

44:09.313 --> 44:11.315
Just because I put up with your shit,

44:11.398 --> 44:13.442
doesn't mean you get to shit all over me.

44:13.525 --> 44:15.653
Do you really want to have a go?

44:15.736 --> 44:17.321
Is that it?

44:17.404 --> 44:19.031
Are you looking to start something?

44:19.114 --> 44:20.366
Is that what you want?

44:20.449 --> 44:22.493
No, sir, I sincerely apologize!

44:22.576 --> 44:24.620
Ma Sang-gil, you son of a bitch!

44:44.723 --> 44:47.601
Got all that out of your system?

44:47.685 --> 44:48.977
Fucking hell…

44:49.061 --> 44:50.479
Got some more?

44:53.232 --> 44:58.362
Why are you getting worked up
all of sudden?

44:59.238 --> 45:01.073
Weren't you the one

45:01.615 --> 45:04.576
who was up in arms about mutual respect?

45:05.744 --> 45:07.454
Think this through.

45:08.914 --> 45:12.167
You know Yang has my boss on his payroll.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.964
Go for his jugular and heads will roll,

45:18.215 --> 45:19.842
I'll tell you that much.

45:19.925 --> 45:21.635
So that's not an option.

45:23.095 --> 45:25.973
Chief Ma, do me this favor.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.516
It's not like we're strangers here,

45:27.599 --> 45:31.019
we only want what's best
for all of us, no?

45:45.576 --> 45:47.411
So what then?

45:48.537 --> 45:49.621
What do you propose?

46:16.440 --> 46:17.274
You're awake?

46:17.357 --> 46:19.026
Why are you here?

46:19.109 --> 46:22.112
Your uncle was called away

46:22.196 --> 46:23.989
by guests, wait a minute.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.741
Hey. Today…

46:25.824 --> 46:27.576
Holy crap…

46:33.332 --> 46:35.334
You can look, I don't charge.

46:42.591 --> 46:45.552
There wasn't much to look at.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.400
Got something to say to me?

47:02.903 --> 47:03.737
What?

47:04.821 --> 47:07.366
No, I got nothing.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.495
Why do you keep staring at me then?

47:12.204 --> 47:17.000
Do I look pitiful now that
you know I'm terminally ill?

47:29.763 --> 47:30.639
What's with you?

47:34.268 --> 47:35.352
Want to grab a bite?

47:40.440 --> 47:41.650
Aren't you hungry?

47:45.320 --> 47:46.154
Aren't you?

47:47.406 --> 47:48.824
I'm not that hungry.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.622
You know how to eat <i>mulhoe</i>?

47:57.082 --> 47:58.792
It's amazing here.

47:59.626 --> 48:03.005
Mainland tourists don't know
about this place yet,

48:04.464 --> 48:06.133
and I've made peace with dying,

48:07.426 --> 48:09.803
but I'll really miss the <i>mulhoe</i> here.

48:14.141 --> 48:14.975
Thank you.

48:15.058 --> 48:16.893
Enjoy your meal.

48:16.977 --> 48:18.645
Gosh.

48:19.938 --> 48:21.106
This is the stuff.

48:34.119 --> 48:35.829
You're not into these dishes?

48:38.582 --> 48:40.042
Is it too exotic for you?

48:42.544 --> 48:43.837
Or is it the fish stench?

48:44.671 --> 48:45.839
Whatever.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.301
It's your loss.

49:00.604 --> 49:01.813
This won't do.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.191
Ma'am, could I get a bottle of Hallasan?

49:15.327 --> 49:17.954
Jeez, what a prima donna.

49:18.038 --> 49:19.748
Whatever.

49:35.931 --> 49:37.557
You know how to handle a gun.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.646
It's nothing at all.

49:46.316 --> 49:47.150
You know,

49:48.110 --> 49:50.070
I started practicing
with a target in mind.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.989
And…

49:54.950 --> 49:56.743
I get nervous without it.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.040
Not even a sip?

50:02.666 --> 50:05.001
It's customary to drink when in Jeju.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.504
Give it a sip.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.723
Good?

50:18.390 --> 50:19.558
Right?

50:20.642 --> 50:22.728
Here, cheers.

50:22.811 --> 50:24.271
No, I'm all right.

50:24.354 --> 50:25.355
I have to drive.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.815
That's why,

50:27.733 --> 50:29.901
you should have just one drink.

50:30.485 --> 50:31.361
Okay?

50:33.196 --> 50:35.657
And DUI checkpoints are unheard of here.

50:35.741 --> 50:39.035
I've never seen it once while living here.

50:39.619 --> 50:41.037
They never check.

50:41.663 --> 50:43.623
Don't worry, have one drink.

50:50.714 --> 50:53.175
ID check, Kim Hyung-jin.

50:53.884 --> 50:57.596
Kim Hyung-jin, 871129.

50:57.679 --> 51:01.433
-125626.
-Blow like you're blowing up a balloon.

51:01.516 --> 51:03.935
-It's 5626.
-Once more please.

51:04.019 --> 51:07.522
More, more, more…

51:07.606 --> 51:08.732
Good, thank you.

51:16.990 --> 51:18.241
So?

51:18.325 --> 51:19.534
He's clean, boss.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.286
So you really did just have a sip.

51:22.287 --> 51:24.080
Thank you for your cooperation.

51:24.164 --> 51:26.792
Even so, drive carefully.

51:26.875 --> 51:27.751
I will.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.254
By the way…

51:32.255 --> 51:33.298
Can you get up?

51:34.049 --> 51:37.427
She looks really wasted.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.054
-Please!
-Can you do something?

51:39.137 --> 51:40.972
-Give us a break, please!
-Help!

51:41.056 --> 51:41.932
I need help!

51:42.015 --> 51:45.852
-Oh man, did she drink a keg?
-It's all my fault…

51:48.897 --> 51:50.065
Hey…

51:50.148 --> 51:51.441
Help her up!

51:51.983 --> 51:53.318
What are you doing?

51:54.110 --> 51:54.986
Oh my…

51:55.070 --> 51:56.571
Should we call an ambulance?

52:23.223 --> 52:25.225
<i>I'm heading your way tomorrow.</i>

52:25.308 --> 52:26.810
<i>Pack up and standby.</i>

52:27.435 --> 52:30.730
<i>Leave no trace, you know that, right?</i>

52:30.814 --> 52:32.148
Understood, boss.

52:33.942 --> 52:37.821
I haven't been able to get in touch
with my boys, including Jin-sung.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.532
<i>Yes…</i>

52:40.615 --> 52:41.700
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

52:42.409 --> 52:44.828
<i>You may already have sensed it,</i>

52:44.911 --> 52:46.872
<i>Bukseong whipped us good.</i>

52:46.955 --> 52:49.791
<i>Jin-sung and the others are in hiding,</i>

52:50.375 --> 52:52.794
<i>and I'll be heading out
to Vladivostok with you.</i>

52:53.336 --> 52:55.130
<i>I'll fill you in tomorrow,</i>

52:55.797 --> 52:56.965
<i>so be ready.</i>

52:57.549 --> 52:58.758
Yes, boss.

53:20.822 --> 53:22.699
This is Park Tae-gu.

53:22.782 --> 53:25.619
The one who stabbed Chairman Doh.

53:26.202 --> 53:29.372
As a gesture of apology, Mr. Yang will…

53:32.751 --> 53:35.128
hand him over…

53:36.546 --> 53:38.006
to Bukseong.

53:38.089 --> 53:41.676
Take care of him as you see fit.

53:42.344 --> 53:45.430
The entire ordeal
was a rogue action of Park.

53:45.513 --> 53:48.850
An act of personal vendetta.

53:49.601 --> 53:50.810
That's the end of it.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.896
Do we have an agreement?

53:56.858 --> 53:58.360
In addition,

53:58.443 --> 54:01.529
once that brazen bastard,
who had the balls

54:01.613 --> 54:04.115
to raise his knife at Bukseong's don,

54:04.199 --> 54:05.825
is dealt with by Chief Ma.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.332
The clean-up

54:13.166 --> 54:15.543
will be carried out by Mr. Yang.

54:15.627 --> 54:19.422
It'd be preferable if he left no trace.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.174
But if he surfaces in any way,

54:21.758 --> 54:23.927
Mr. Yang will take the blame in full.

54:28.890 --> 54:29.766
Yes, sir.

54:29.849 --> 54:32.727
So, Chief Ma, are you satisfied
with the terms?

54:33.895 --> 54:36.231
It's not entirely satisfactory,

54:37.691 --> 54:39.109
but I'll play along.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.027
Make absolutely sure

54:42.487 --> 54:44.698
there aren't any loose ends.

54:45.907 --> 54:47.075
Do you understand

54:48.410 --> 54:49.744
what I'm saying?

55:07.679 --> 55:08.763
By the way,

55:10.724 --> 55:14.019
how big of a fuck up did you cause?

55:19.149 --> 55:21.943
You came here from Seoul to lay low.

55:22.944 --> 55:23.862
Isn't that right?

55:25.196 --> 55:26.322
That's enough.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.617
Heading to Vladivostok, right?

55:29.701 --> 55:33.288
You must've really fucked shit up.

55:34.497 --> 55:35.957
You can tell me.

55:36.708 --> 55:37.792
I said enough.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.296
I see…

55:42.756 --> 55:44.966
So you got the death sentence.

55:45.050 --> 55:46.301
That's what it is.

55:52.682 --> 55:53.558
Enough.

55:54.225 --> 55:57.103
I told you to stop, are you deaf?

55:59.606 --> 56:00.440
I'm right.

56:01.608 --> 56:02.901
Dead man walking.

56:03.651 --> 56:05.236
That's it then.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.448
You fled alone to save your own neck.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.116
Say that again.

56:10.658 --> 56:13.203
I've fucking had it!

56:17.665 --> 56:19.375
Go on, hit me.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.544
It's all right.

56:24.881 --> 56:26.174
I can take it.

56:27.258 --> 56:28.301
Hit me.

56:28.384 --> 56:30.470
Why are you doing this to me?

56:30.553 --> 56:31.971
Have I done something to you?

56:34.307 --> 56:36.935
Forget it, drive me home.

56:38.436 --> 56:39.646
Uncle must be waiting.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.543
What's with your tone?

57:03.253 --> 57:04.254
We're not friends.

57:04.337 --> 57:05.588
You're just a kid.

57:06.464 --> 57:07.632
You did it first.

57:09.467 --> 57:11.761
How old are you?

57:11.845 --> 57:14.514
What a geezer.

57:14.597 --> 57:17.183
Always playing the age card
when you got nothing better.

57:18.143 --> 57:20.854
Getting old isn't a badge of honor.

57:20.937 --> 57:22.772
You may have been born earlier,

57:22.856 --> 57:25.066
but I'll certainly die first.

57:26.067 --> 57:27.735
So I got that going for me.

57:27.819 --> 57:29.988
If you got a problem,
you could try dying first.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.014
You don't need to count.

57:56.097 --> 57:57.098
It's all there.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.684
If you're done shopping, you may go.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.187
I got somewhere to be.

58:02.270 --> 58:04.230
Just out of curiosity,

58:04.314 --> 58:06.357
is this everything you got?

58:06.441 --> 58:08.318
Yes, why do you keep asking?

58:08.985 --> 58:10.153
You sure?

58:12.363 --> 58:13.907
I am fucking sure.

58:13.990 --> 58:16.951
Don't be pissy about it,
I was just asking.

58:19.287 --> 58:22.207
I'll eventually find out

58:22.290 --> 58:24.209
whether you got more stashed or not.

58:30.173 --> 58:32.759
Fucking old bastard!

58:38.139 --> 58:41.434
Damn, Kuto, you still got it.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.938
A big shot in Russia sure is different.

58:45.021 --> 58:47.315
What are you up to?

58:47.398 --> 58:49.776
I've told you before,
dumping could stir problems

58:49.859 --> 58:51.903
with Bukseong and the Russian boys.

58:51.986 --> 58:56.032
Bukseong made me an offer.
You for the Russian connection.

58:56.115 --> 59:00.161
Go on, send him packing. He's a busy man.

59:33.820 --> 59:34.696
Come on out!

59:34.779 --> 59:35.822
Kuto, dude!

59:35.905 --> 59:37.448
Hold on, man.

59:37.532 --> 59:39.075
Let's talk about this, okay?

59:45.081 --> 59:46.249
Careful!

59:58.720 --> 1:00:00.263
Toss my money.

1:00:20.408 --> 1:00:21.784
Dude.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:22.869
Have a good trip.

1:00:49.228 --> 1:00:51.397
Boss, you okay?

1:00:51.481 --> 1:00:54.776
Come on, get the money and the guns!

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:55.860
Uncle!

1:00:55.943 --> 1:00:57.654
Hey! Stop!

1:00:58.237 --> 1:00:59.447
Are you nuts?

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:03.951
You're fine, it's just a graze.

1:01:04.035 --> 1:01:05.745
No shit! You want a graze too?!

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:09.415
Uncle!

1:01:13.544 --> 1:01:14.712
Uncle!

1:01:15.338 --> 1:01:16.547
No, Uncle… Please!

1:01:16.631 --> 1:01:19.092
Uncle!

1:01:20.009 --> 1:01:21.719
Open your eyes!

1:01:23.262 --> 1:01:24.847
What the hell happened?

1:01:25.473 --> 1:01:27.058
How…

1:01:30.103 --> 1:01:31.270
Get rid of her.

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.733
No…

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:41.030
What the fuck is this?

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:42.865
I'll kill this fucker.

1:01:42.949 --> 1:01:46.327
He's got a knife on my neck,
drop everything!

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.539
Okay, easy!

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:53.209
No!

1:01:56.254 --> 1:01:57.296
I'm…

1:02:00.007 --> 1:02:04.178
I'm so sorry…

1:02:05.054 --> 1:02:06.681
Don't talk, okay?

1:02:07.265 --> 1:02:09.642
Save your breath, don't say anything.

1:02:10.309 --> 1:02:11.310
I'm so grateful…

1:02:14.188 --> 1:02:16.441
that you did not hate me…

1:02:17.191 --> 1:02:18.359
Thank you…

1:02:21.154 --> 1:02:22.405
Uncle!

1:02:42.508 --> 1:02:43.593
Uncle?

1:02:45.678 --> 1:02:47.138
What are you doing?

1:02:48.556 --> 1:02:49.515
Uncle!

1:02:49.599 --> 1:02:51.184
Uncle!

1:02:53.227 --> 1:02:54.437
No!

1:02:58.566 --> 1:03:00.026
Please!

1:03:06.032 --> 1:03:08.367
Are you Park Tae-gu?

1:03:12.663 --> 1:03:13.790
You son of a bitch!

1:03:14.624 --> 1:03:15.625
What the fuck!

1:03:49.867 --> 1:03:51.035
That's enough.

1:04:10.721 --> 1:04:13.683
We have to go, they'll be back soon.

1:04:16.227 --> 1:04:17.812
Get it together, we have to go!

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:25.611
Did you not hear me? We have to go!

1:04:29.490 --> 1:04:30.533
What about my uncle?

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:35.872
Kuto…

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:39.083
He's dead.

1:04:41.794 --> 1:04:43.713
Who's dead?

1:04:44.839 --> 1:04:46.465
Say that again!

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:48.050
Who's dead?

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:49.594
Who?

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:51.554
You're fucking out of your mind!

1:04:51.637 --> 1:04:53.264
Snap out of it!

1:04:53.347 --> 1:04:54.682
What did you say?

1:04:54.765 --> 1:04:56.183
You son of a bitch!

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:57.351
Fuck…

1:04:57.435 --> 1:04:59.854
Let go!

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:01.981
Stop it!

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:09.697
Stop the car! You fucker!
Where are you taking me?

1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:10.615
Stop the car!

1:05:11.532 --> 1:05:13.409
Stop, please…

1:05:13.492 --> 1:05:16.829
-Will you stay put?
-No! Please!

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.456
Stop the car!

1:05:22.251 --> 1:05:23.169
Hey.

1:05:23.878 --> 1:05:25.880
Hey!

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:33.638
Hey, look!

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:36.974
Hey! Is this it?

1:06:12.259 --> 1:06:16.138
WATER FOUNTAIN

1:07:07.523 --> 1:07:08.983
Make a left here?

1:07:10.234 --> 1:07:11.152
Yeah.

1:07:31.881 --> 1:07:33.257
Oh my!

1:07:33.340 --> 1:07:35.217
Jae-yeon, it's been so long!

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:36.886
Have you been well?

1:07:36.969 --> 1:07:38.971
-Yes, how are you?
-Good.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:41.682
Are you not feeling well?

1:07:41.766 --> 1:07:44.143
Is everything okay?

1:07:45.019 --> 1:07:46.604
I'm just tired, that's all.

1:07:46.687 --> 1:07:48.439
-All right, let's head inside.
-Sure.

1:07:48.522 --> 1:07:51.150
I prepped the best room
after receiving your call.

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:55.362
But why is your uncle
renovating the house now?

1:07:55.446 --> 1:07:57.782
It seems very out of the blue.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:08:01.535
He asked me to find him a buyer
so he can sell it on the cheap.

1:08:01.619 --> 1:08:03.162
Did the pipe burst again?

1:08:03.996 --> 1:08:05.581
No.

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:07.792
You know how fickle he can be.

1:08:09.001 --> 1:08:10.002
I guess so.

1:08:10.836 --> 1:08:11.670
Right.

1:08:12.213 --> 1:08:13.297
Who is he?

1:08:14.882 --> 1:08:16.175
Your boyfriend?

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:17.885
What?

1:08:20.346 --> 1:08:23.432
No, he's one of Uncle's guests.

1:08:24.183 --> 1:08:25.184
Right?

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:29.855
You mustn't date random men out there.

1:08:30.856 --> 1:08:33.150
Will you stop nagging her?

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:34.485
It's important, that's why.

1:08:34.568 --> 1:08:36.695
What's gotten into you, woman?

1:09:11.689 --> 1:09:13.357
I thought you didn't like to drink.

1:09:19.530 --> 1:09:20.406
Are you okay?

1:09:22.074 --> 1:09:23.325
Piss off.

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:26.495
Do I look okay?

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:30.082
No.

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:39.925
I hate it when assholes ask me that

1:09:41.510 --> 1:09:44.054
when they already know I'm not.

1:09:46.223 --> 1:09:49.018
Keep your mouth shut
if you don't know what to say.

1:09:59.028 --> 1:09:59.987
Are you okay?

1:10:09.246 --> 1:10:10.497
Do I look okay?

1:10:13.918 --> 1:10:14.960
No.

1:10:17.588 --> 1:10:18.589
I hate it

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:21.717
when bitches

1:10:22.509 --> 1:10:25.012
ask me that…

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:28.599
when they already know…

1:10:32.353 --> 1:10:33.771
What do I do now?

1:10:38.525 --> 1:10:39.985
I got no one…

1:10:41.904 --> 1:10:43.405
in the world now.

1:10:48.702 --> 1:10:50.454
<i>Because of Uncle,</i>

1:10:52.498 --> 1:10:55.626
the Russian mob killed my family,

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:58.796
and he killed them all

1:10:59.713 --> 1:11:01.757
as an act of revenge.

1:11:03.801 --> 1:11:07.388
That made him a legend
in his field, I hear.

1:11:24.488 --> 1:11:26.490
I loathed him…

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:29.868
He should've died.

1:11:31.954 --> 1:11:34.164
Why did my parents die instead?

1:11:37.334 --> 1:11:38.752
Why did my brother?

1:11:41.547 --> 1:11:46.385
My uncle alone should have died
from the beginning.

1:11:49.179 --> 1:11:51.181
I cursed him every day.

1:11:53.183 --> 1:11:55.894
"Fucking lowlife asshole,

1:11:55.978 --> 1:11:57.271
just die already."

1:12:04.695 --> 1:12:07.906
And then he got himself killed.

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:11.452
But why do I feel this way?

1:12:14.830 --> 1:12:16.248
Over here…

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:20.044
it really hurts.

1:12:24.923 --> 1:12:26.342
My heart aches.

1:12:30.304 --> 1:12:32.639
I wished for him to die

1:12:34.558 --> 1:12:36.226
countless times.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:41.315
That's all I wanted…

1:12:47.154 --> 1:12:49.156
Why is this happening to me?

1:12:51.658 --> 1:12:53.911
Why is everyone leaving me?

1:13:20.604 --> 1:13:21.980
Do you want to sleep with me?

1:13:26.026 --> 1:13:27.069
Get in.

1:13:27.945 --> 1:13:29.154
Don't you want to?

1:13:30.948 --> 1:13:32.074
What?

1:13:34.535 --> 1:13:36.620
Come here.

1:13:43.085 --> 1:13:45.754
It's all right, I don't care.

1:13:46.797 --> 1:13:49.633
I'll be dead soon anyway.

1:13:51.176 --> 1:13:53.804
I'm really okay, get over here.

1:13:55.013 --> 1:13:56.181
It's not that…

1:14:00.727 --> 1:14:02.020
I'm not okay with it.

1:14:03.730 --> 1:14:04.940
What?

1:14:05.023 --> 1:14:06.567
I'm sorry about this.

1:14:06.650 --> 1:14:11.655
You're not exactly my type.

1:14:14.158 --> 1:14:16.618
It's not like I sleep with anyone

1:14:16.702 --> 1:14:19.496
who's willing and ready.

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:22.833
You're so full of yourself.

1:14:52.404 --> 1:14:55.365
What a loser, forget it.

1:14:55.449 --> 1:14:57.868
You're not my type either.

1:14:58.452 --> 1:14:59.286
Whatever.

1:16:36.717 --> 1:16:38.343
I'll be there on time.

1:16:44.224 --> 1:16:46.059
I understand.

1:16:47.269 --> 1:16:48.562
Yes, boss.

1:17:01.867 --> 1:17:03.285
Let's get breakfast.

1:17:05.329 --> 1:17:07.623
I don't feel like it.

1:17:10.542 --> 1:17:13.128
Come on, I'll treat you.

1:17:32.522 --> 1:17:33.899
You're gonna eat?

1:17:33.982 --> 1:17:35.150
Yes.

1:17:36.026 --> 1:17:37.819
I want to have it before I die.

1:17:38.737 --> 1:17:41.114
You said you wouldn't forget this
even after death.

1:17:57.422 --> 1:17:58.465
Holy shit.

1:18:01.218 --> 1:18:02.969
I thought you couldn't eat that.

1:18:03.053 --> 1:18:05.097
I can't get enough of this.

1:18:07.808 --> 1:18:10.602
<i>Mulhoe</i> is actually my favorite.

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:13.897
I grew up

1:18:15.524 --> 1:18:17.317
by the sea,

1:18:20.404 --> 1:18:22.155
and whenever food ran out,

1:18:23.156 --> 1:18:25.242
my mom went to the wholesale market,

1:18:25.992 --> 1:18:29.454
picked up leftover fish
and made this for us

1:18:29.538 --> 1:18:31.540
with plenty of sweet <i>chojang</i>.

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:34.960
My sister said she was sick of it,

1:18:35.669 --> 1:18:38.422
she hated even the smell of this.

1:18:43.552 --> 1:18:45.971
But for some reason, I love it.

1:18:46.638 --> 1:18:49.224
Even now, when I see this,

1:18:49.933 --> 1:18:52.227
memories of my mom flood back.

1:18:53.770 --> 1:18:55.397
And it's like I can smell her too.

1:18:56.398 --> 1:18:57.774
It's nice.

1:19:06.366 --> 1:19:07.701
Why aren't you eating?

1:19:12.748 --> 1:19:14.249
Should I eat yours too?

1:19:14.332 --> 1:19:15.208
Don't you dare.

1:19:15.709 --> 1:19:16.877
Don't touch mine.

1:19:19.463 --> 1:19:21.047
I didn't say I wasn't eating.

1:21:07.696 --> 1:21:10.031
Are the boys there on standby?

1:21:10.115 --> 1:21:12.492
Yes, they're on standby
with the Busan boys.

1:21:38.768 --> 1:21:40.395
I'm going to the airport for a bit.

1:21:48.445 --> 1:21:49.654
Don't go.

1:21:51.948 --> 1:21:53.325
Don't you think it's weird?

1:21:54.534 --> 1:21:56.745
You said you can't reach your people.

1:22:01.082 --> 1:22:03.126
-That's the situation--
-What situation?

1:22:10.967 --> 1:22:11.968
No.

1:22:15.597 --> 1:22:17.223
Just don't go.

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:19.726
It doesn't feel right.

1:22:21.853 --> 1:22:23.480
And I don't want to be alone.

1:22:30.070 --> 1:22:32.197
It's nice and sunny today!

1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:34.449
This will dry in no time!

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.868
What are you doing? They'll hear you!

1:22:36.952 --> 1:22:39.746
Shut it, you old fart,
I want them to hear me!

1:22:39.829 --> 1:22:41.289
Oh Christ…

1:22:45.794 --> 1:22:47.504
I'll be back shortly.

1:24:15.133 --> 1:24:17.802
Asswipe, what the hell happened?
Why don't you ever answer?

1:24:17.886 --> 1:24:18.720
<i>Sir!</i>

1:24:18.803 --> 1:24:20.430
What's going on?

1:24:20.513 --> 1:24:22.599
<i>That bastard Yang backstabbed us.</i>

1:24:23.183 --> 1:24:24.017
What?

1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:26.227
<i>Yang sold you out!</i>

1:24:27.437 --> 1:24:32.442
<i>It's not just you, he sold all of us out!</i>

1:24:33.485 --> 1:24:34.986
<i>That rat fucker…</i>

1:24:35.695 --> 1:24:36.654
He…

1:24:38.406 --> 1:24:39.532
Fucker!

1:24:40.784 --> 1:24:43.036
Jin-sung, hey!

1:25:05.058 --> 1:25:06.893
Wait!

1:25:11.397 --> 1:25:12.607
Tae-gu!

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:18.029
Hey, where are you going?

1:25:22.784 --> 1:25:23.827
Move!

1:25:28.498 --> 1:25:31.084
-Stop right there!
-Hurry!

1:25:32.293 --> 1:25:33.378
Damm it!

1:25:37.423 --> 1:25:39.717
Second floor! Stop him!

1:25:43.888 --> 1:25:44.889
Shit!

1:25:46.015 --> 1:25:47.100
Hey!

1:26:08.705 --> 1:26:10.206
-Get him!
-Stop!

1:26:21.301 --> 1:26:22.177
Right there!

1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:24.095
Get in!

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.020
Pull that fucker out!

1:28:39.856 --> 1:28:41.149
Go!

1:28:41.858 --> 1:28:43.318
-Open up!
-Son of a bitch!

1:28:45.153 --> 1:28:46.696
Park Tae-gu, you fucker!

1:28:51.034 --> 1:28:52.577
You're a dead man!

1:28:53.202 --> 1:28:54.829
Let go!

1:28:56.372 --> 1:28:57.999
Pull him out!

1:29:08.092 --> 1:29:09.218
Get out of the car!

1:29:35.453 --> 1:29:37.955
Come at me, motherfuckers!

1:29:48.382 --> 1:29:49.634
Grab him!

1:29:49.717 --> 1:29:51.469
You fucking shit!

1:29:52.970 --> 1:29:53.805
Stop!

1:29:58.392 --> 1:29:59.644
Disperse!

1:30:12.615 --> 1:30:13.825
I think they lost him.

1:30:20.498 --> 1:30:22.125
What will you do now?

1:30:24.418 --> 1:30:26.212
I asked you a question, fuck face.

1:30:26.295 --> 1:30:27.505
Give me something.

1:30:27.588 --> 1:30:29.507
I can get him, I really can.

1:30:30.341 --> 1:30:31.884
Not that, asshole.

1:30:32.593 --> 1:30:36.180
Chief Ma, don't do this. Listen to me.

1:30:38.099 --> 1:30:40.643
-So how will you catch him, bitch?
-Hold on.

1:30:40.726 --> 1:30:42.562
We got Jin-sung.

1:30:43.146 --> 1:30:45.273
He's Tae-gu's right-hand man.

1:30:48.192 --> 1:30:49.819
We can use that bastard.

1:30:57.368 --> 1:30:58.828
Look at this fucker.

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:03.958
You really are a scumbag.

1:31:04.792 --> 1:31:06.919
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:31:07.837 --> 1:31:10.047
I feel dirty just being in your presence.

1:31:10.131 --> 1:31:12.425
Scoot over, social distancing and all.

1:31:13.134 --> 1:31:14.302
Scoot.

1:31:15.636 --> 1:31:17.388
Open the window, shit.

1:31:17.471 --> 1:31:18.848
Yes, sir.

1:31:27.982 --> 1:31:29.108
Hey!

1:31:31.485 --> 1:31:32.778
Where did she go?

1:31:35.323 --> 1:31:38.075
Where did Jae-yeon go?

1:31:38.159 --> 1:31:39.410
She went back to the farm.

1:31:39.493 --> 1:31:41.412
She said she wanted to
tell her uncle something,

1:31:41.495 --> 1:31:42.455
and to bring her things.

1:31:42.538 --> 1:31:44.707
She asked me to borrow my truck.

1:31:44.790 --> 1:31:45.708
Wait…

1:31:45.791 --> 1:31:48.294
She'll be back shortly,
she wanted you to wait!

1:31:55.051 --> 1:31:56.886
Where the fuck are you?

1:31:56.969 --> 1:31:58.846
Is something up your ass?

1:31:58.930 --> 1:32:00.765
<i>I told you to stay put,
get back here at once!</i>

1:32:00.848 --> 1:32:02.391
I told you not to go, yet you still went.

1:32:02.475 --> 1:32:05.019
<i>Fine, I'm sorry. Can you get back?</i>

1:32:05.102 --> 1:32:07.730
I'll be right there,
I can't leave Uncle like this.

1:32:07.813 --> 1:32:10.233
<i>Goddammit!
Listen, his body is long gone, moron!</i>

1:32:10.316 --> 1:32:12.401
<i>They probably moved him,
why'd they leave him there?</i>

1:32:14.070 --> 1:32:17.198
<i>Are you listening? Get out of there!
Get the fuck out of there!</i>

1:32:17.281 --> 1:32:19.909
I hear you fine!

1:32:21.035 --> 1:32:23.496
-I'll be back soon, talk to you later!
-<i>Hey! Wait!</i>

1:32:23.579 --> 1:32:24.747
Hello?

1:32:26.791 --> 1:32:28.501
God-fucking-damn!

1:33:27.977 --> 1:33:29.228
<i>Now you answer?</i>

1:33:29.312 --> 1:33:31.147
<i>Tae-gu, where are you?</i>

1:33:34.233 --> 1:33:35.234
<i>Tae-gu?</i>

1:33:36.027 --> 1:33:37.320
Did you sell me out?

1:33:40.031 --> 1:33:42.658
<i>Tae-gu, the thing is…</i>

1:33:43.367 --> 1:33:45.286
And you sold my boys out too.

1:33:49.623 --> 1:33:51.625
<i>That's not it…</i>

1:33:51.709 --> 1:33:53.419
Answer me, fucker!

1:33:54.295 --> 1:33:56.672
<i>Don't you bark at me, dipshit!</i>

1:33:58.466 --> 1:34:00.009
<i>All right, I'm sorry.</i>

1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:02.511
<i>I really am, Tae-gu, but…</i>

1:34:02.595 --> 1:34:04.263
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:34:04.347 --> 1:34:06.974
<i>Everything started because of you.</i>

1:34:07.725 --> 1:34:10.186
<i>You have to take responsibility
for your actions.</i>

1:34:10.269 --> 1:34:14.315
Keep this up and your boys
will die for no reason.

1:34:14.398 --> 1:34:15.232
If you…

1:34:23.824 --> 1:34:26.243
Park Tae-gu, this is Bukseong's Chief Ma.

1:34:26.952 --> 1:34:29.538
We've crossed paths a few times.

1:34:30.498 --> 1:34:31.832
I won't mince words.

1:34:33.084 --> 1:34:36.045
We've got a score to settle.

1:34:36.879 --> 1:34:38.672
Be here within the hour.

1:34:39.632 --> 1:34:43.844
If you skip town,
you'll pay a steep price.

1:34:44.804 --> 1:34:48.099
Jin-sung or whatever will die,

1:34:49.725 --> 1:34:50.768
and so will she.

1:34:55.439 --> 1:34:56.440
<i>Listen.</i>

1:34:56.524 --> 1:34:59.276
<i>It's your life or theirs.</i>

1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:02.905
<i>They're too young to die,
why do they need to suffer?</i>

1:35:02.988 --> 1:35:04.198
<i>In any case,</i>

1:35:05.324 --> 1:35:06.909
<i>you'll end up dead</i>

1:35:06.992 --> 1:35:09.870
whether you come here or not.

1:35:11.455 --> 1:35:13.749
Don't bother trying to take off.

1:35:16.210 --> 1:35:17.211
<i>Are you listening?</i>

1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:19.380
All right, I'll come.

1:35:20.881 --> 1:35:21.841
I'll be there.

1:35:21.924 --> 1:35:23.843
<i>Very good.</i>

1:35:23.926 --> 1:35:25.594
<i>That's the Park Tae-gu I know.</i>

1:35:25.678 --> 1:35:27.471
<i>You really are a stand-up guy.</i>

1:35:27.555 --> 1:35:28.806
But promise me this.

1:35:29.682 --> 1:35:33.436
Let the girl and Jin-sung go.

1:35:35.896 --> 1:35:38.065
Don't worry, I promise.

1:35:39.150 --> 1:35:40.359
You know me.

1:35:41.735 --> 1:35:44.071
I don't go back on my word
like someone here.

1:35:45.448 --> 1:35:46.782
What?

1:35:51.287 --> 1:35:52.329
Sure.

1:35:53.289 --> 1:35:54.498
Yes, why not.

1:35:54.582 --> 1:35:56.625
Do you want me to connect her
on a video call?

1:35:57.543 --> 1:35:59.712
Fuck, just get over here
and see for yourself.

1:36:09.472 --> 1:36:10.598
He wants to talk to you.

1:36:14.310 --> 1:36:16.562
Don't come, are you insane?

1:36:17.605 --> 1:36:20.232
Are you stupid or something?
Why come here?

1:36:20.316 --> 1:36:21.984
You know I'm dying soon.

1:36:23.194 --> 1:36:25.446
I'm the same, you heard the man.

1:36:25.529 --> 1:36:26.906
I'm dead either way.

1:36:33.579 --> 1:36:35.456
And you said you didn't want to be alone.

1:36:36.499 --> 1:36:38.709
<i>Hang in there, I'll be there shortly.</i>

1:36:48.511 --> 1:36:51.013
Hurry, you got an hour.

1:36:52.014 --> 1:36:55.434
I fucking hate assholes
who aren't punctual.

1:36:56.310 --> 1:36:59.355
But if you're here on time, as a reward,

1:37:00.314 --> 1:37:02.566
I'll give you a going away present.

1:37:03.442 --> 1:37:04.652
Just you wait.

1:37:06.529 --> 1:37:07.738
You'll love it.

1:37:32.972 --> 1:37:37.101
You were in middle school, about yay high

1:37:38.060 --> 1:37:39.562
when I saw you last.

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:45.442
Do you remember me?

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:47.820
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:37:49.238 --> 1:37:51.782
I was bigger than that
in elementary school.

1:37:56.704 --> 1:37:59.248
Listen to this bitch yap.

1:38:00.332 --> 1:38:04.253
Watch your mouth when talking
to your elders, kiddo.

1:38:04.336 --> 1:38:06.505
You were being an asshole first.

1:38:06.589 --> 1:38:08.757
It's not like we're best buds.

1:38:11.010 --> 1:38:12.428
You got a death wish?

1:38:12.511 --> 1:38:13.470
Go on.

1:38:14.513 --> 1:38:16.724
I'll end up dead

1:38:16.807 --> 1:38:18.142
in a few days anyway.

1:38:20.686 --> 1:38:23.188
Don't you value your life at all?

1:38:24.231 --> 1:38:26.358
How did you end up like this?

1:38:27.693 --> 1:38:31.822
Kuto really did a number on you.

1:39:59.910 --> 1:40:01.245
You fucking asshole!

1:40:01.829 --> 1:40:02.705
Weak ass bitch!

1:40:03.497 --> 1:40:05.582
Motherfucker!

1:40:05.666 --> 1:40:06.834
Move, move!

1:40:06.917 --> 1:40:08.335
-Fucking shit!
-Piss ant fucker!

1:40:08.419 --> 1:40:09.837
Goddamn!

1:40:11.505 --> 1:40:13.257
Fucker.

1:40:18.262 --> 1:40:19.471
Welcome.

1:40:19.555 --> 1:40:21.807
Park Tae-gu, you fucking asshole.

1:40:44.997 --> 1:40:45.873
You're here.

1:40:48.751 --> 1:40:49.960
Hey.

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:01.054
Are you okay?

1:41:04.808 --> 1:41:05.851
I'm okay.

1:41:08.061 --> 1:41:09.188
You?

1:41:10.439 --> 1:41:12.691
Do I look okay?

1:41:18.906 --> 1:41:19.740
No.

1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:22.951
I hate it

1:41:24.703 --> 1:41:27.331
when bitches ask me that

1:41:29.583 --> 1:41:32.085
when they already know I'm not.

1:41:43.472 --> 1:41:44.723
But thank you…

1:41:45.974 --> 1:41:47.601
for asking.

1:41:49.311 --> 1:41:52.731
What the hell's going on here?

1:41:54.024 --> 1:41:56.276
Trying to get a decent flirting going?

1:41:58.695 --> 1:42:00.197
Are you two dating?

1:42:00.781 --> 1:42:01.698
What if we are?

1:42:02.574 --> 1:42:03.909
What's it to you?

1:42:04.535 --> 1:42:06.203
That mouth again, shit.

1:42:06.870 --> 1:42:08.038
Jeez.

1:42:09.665 --> 1:42:12.084
Make the fucking call.

1:42:12.167 --> 1:42:15.629
Let Jin-sung go as you promised.

1:42:19.591 --> 1:42:22.845
He's got a mouth problem too.

1:42:23.595 --> 1:42:25.389
What's with you two?

1:42:26.139 --> 1:42:29.059
I'm still way older than you guys!

1:42:31.103 --> 1:42:32.771
Whatever, forget it.

1:42:33.438 --> 1:42:35.524
You'll be dead anyway.

1:42:35.607 --> 1:42:38.902
Buddy, call the hospital.

1:42:38.986 --> 1:42:40.112
Right away, sir.

1:42:41.738 --> 1:42:44.116
Rude millennials…

1:42:49.746 --> 1:42:51.456
Hold still.

1:42:52.624 --> 1:42:54.835
Damn it!

1:43:05.429 --> 1:43:06.555
What?

1:43:07.306 --> 1:43:09.141
What do you mean?

1:43:09.975 --> 1:43:11.226
Who did?

1:43:13.645 --> 1:43:14.730
Hey, Mr. Yang.

1:43:16.648 --> 1:43:18.150
Was it you?

1:43:19.443 --> 1:43:21.278
Did you order a hit on Tae-gu's man?

1:43:23.989 --> 1:43:25.824
He had to go anyway.

1:43:25.908 --> 1:43:28.827
He could pose a problem
if he's left alive.

1:43:28.911 --> 1:43:30.078
Are you fucking kidding?

1:43:30.162 --> 1:43:31.246
Chief Ma! Hold on!

1:43:31.747 --> 1:43:32.623
Goddamn!

1:43:33.749 --> 1:43:34.708
Wait, Chief Ma!

1:43:34.791 --> 1:43:37.127
I'm going to gut you alive
and hang you like a pig!

1:43:37.210 --> 1:43:38.921
Chief Ma, please! Don't kill me!

1:43:39.004 --> 1:43:39.922
-Son of a bitch!
-Wait!

1:43:40.005 --> 1:43:42.674
Please don't kill me. I'm begging you…

1:43:42.758 --> 1:43:44.635
I'm sorry, but don't forget Captain Park!

1:43:44.718 --> 1:43:46.762
Don't kill me for his sake,
you heard what he said.

1:43:46.845 --> 1:43:50.390
Killing me will create more problems!

1:43:50.474 --> 1:43:52.142
That punk ass Jin-sung.

1:43:52.225 --> 1:43:53.685
He's Tae-gu's loyal minion.

1:43:53.769 --> 1:43:55.187
If he's left alive,

1:43:55.270 --> 1:43:57.064
we don't know what he will do!

1:43:57.147 --> 1:43:59.983
It's all for our own good.
I'm just trying to be helpful, okay?

1:44:00.067 --> 1:44:01.193
It was for us all.

1:44:01.276 --> 1:44:03.570
Yang, you son of a bitch!

1:44:03.654 --> 1:44:05.364
Goddamn you!

1:44:07.407 --> 1:44:09.534
How could you do this to me?

1:44:09.618 --> 1:44:10.619
Fucking hell…

1:44:10.702 --> 1:44:12.120
Come here, you fucker!

1:44:12.204 --> 1:44:14.164
What the fuck…

1:44:14.957 --> 1:44:16.750
What did you say?

1:44:16.833 --> 1:44:18.293
You fucking bitch!

1:44:19.127 --> 1:44:21.046
Did you kiss your mother with that mouth?

1:44:21.129 --> 1:44:22.422
Punk ass bitch!

1:44:22.506 --> 1:44:24.508
We're all in this mess because of you.

1:44:25.217 --> 1:44:26.843
Had you not stabbed Chairman Doh,

1:44:27.552 --> 1:44:31.306
this massacre could have been prevented!

1:44:31.390 --> 1:44:33.308
Fucking Yang Do-soo…

1:44:33.392 --> 1:44:35.519
Yang, I'll kill you!

1:44:35.602 --> 1:44:37.729
You fucking bitch!

1:44:37.813 --> 1:44:40.482
You didn't get a proper beating yet.

1:44:41.108 --> 1:44:42.693
-Motherfucker!
-Stop it!

1:44:42.776 --> 1:44:44.820
Don't hit him!

1:44:45.862 --> 1:44:49.074
-Stop! Don't hit him!
-Did I order you? Did I?

1:44:49.157 --> 1:44:51.159
-Fucker, did I order the hit?
-Just stop it!

1:44:51.243 --> 1:44:53.078
-Hey!
-Son of a bitch!

1:44:53.161 --> 1:44:55.414
-I've had it with you!
-Don't hit him!

1:44:55.497 --> 1:44:57.749
All right, that's enough.

1:44:58.834 --> 1:44:59.710
Stop it.

1:44:59.793 --> 1:45:01.253
You fucker!

1:45:01.336 --> 1:45:03.630
He's gonna kill him.

1:45:04.214 --> 1:45:06.425
Stop hitting him!

1:45:06.508 --> 1:45:08.719
Stop!

1:45:08.802 --> 1:45:10.178
You fucking--

1:45:10.262 --> 1:45:12.347
Let go!

1:45:16.309 --> 1:45:18.311
Jesus, fuck!

1:45:21.982 --> 1:45:23.108
Up.

1:45:26.611 --> 1:45:28.280
I'm impressed.

1:45:29.156 --> 1:45:31.116
You really are something.

1:45:32.034 --> 1:45:34.453
You're no son of a man.

1:45:35.162 --> 1:45:38.081
You're a pest, a fucking rat.

1:45:46.548 --> 1:45:48.216
Fuck…

1:45:49.051 --> 1:45:51.970
I told you to stop, asshole…

1:45:56.975 --> 1:45:57.851
Tae-gu.

1:45:58.602 --> 1:45:59.603
Bud.

1:46:00.937 --> 1:46:02.064
I told you

1:46:03.065 --> 1:46:04.733
I had a gift.

1:46:05.442 --> 1:46:07.611
Here's the kicker.

1:46:12.282 --> 1:46:14.493
It's about your sister's accident.

1:46:17.788 --> 1:46:19.664
On Chairman Doh's orders,

1:46:19.748 --> 1:46:24.211
I squeezed my boys to find out
who was responsible.

1:46:24.294 --> 1:46:25.295
Turns out…

1:46:26.254 --> 1:46:27.589
it wasn't us.

1:46:28.965 --> 1:46:29.925
For real.

1:46:31.301 --> 1:46:33.678
Think about it.

1:46:33.762 --> 1:46:35.931
If we wanted you dead,

1:46:36.014 --> 1:46:37.974
would we use such a dirty method?

1:46:40.352 --> 1:46:42.062
We'd straight up kill you.

1:46:43.271 --> 1:46:44.356
No?

1:46:46.525 --> 1:46:47.651
Then…

1:46:49.986 --> 1:46:51.196
Hey, Yang.

1:46:52.114 --> 1:46:54.574
Care to chime in, asshole?

1:46:54.658 --> 1:46:56.159
Why am I blabbering on?

1:47:02.624 --> 1:47:03.667
Why…

1:47:05.001 --> 1:47:06.378
Why would he…

1:47:06.461 --> 1:47:08.797
It's obvious.

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:13.051
Chairman Doh trying to recruit you
made him anxious.

1:47:13.135 --> 1:47:17.055
With you gone, your boys would follow you,

1:47:17.848 --> 1:47:20.725
and he'd be left as a mortal shell.

1:47:23.061 --> 1:47:25.730
So? Did I get that right?

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:36.658
Motherfucker!

1:47:36.741 --> 1:47:38.660
I'll kill you!

1:47:38.743 --> 1:47:40.287
You son of a bitch!

1:47:40.370 --> 1:47:41.496
I'll fucking kill you!

1:47:43.290 --> 1:47:44.416
Backstabbing fucker!

1:47:46.626 --> 1:47:47.836
Fucking die!

1:47:53.175 --> 1:47:55.510
Die, you fucker!

1:47:56.595 --> 1:47:58.388
Fucker!

1:48:00.849 --> 1:48:03.560
Son of a bitch!

1:48:09.649 --> 1:48:11.151
-Die, asshole!
-Hey.

1:48:16.531 --> 1:48:18.158
What are you doing?!

1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:21.411
Stop it!

1:48:24.873 --> 1:48:27.584
What the hell are you doing?!

1:48:29.085 --> 1:48:30.754
No!

1:48:30.837 --> 1:48:32.255
Don't!

1:48:39.346 --> 1:48:41.806
You son of a bitch!

1:48:42.599 --> 1:48:44.643
Get the fuck up! Come on!

1:48:48.271 --> 1:48:52.234
No!

1:48:52.317 --> 1:48:54.277
Let go of me!

1:48:54.861 --> 1:48:56.363
You fucking bitch!

1:48:57.030 --> 1:48:59.658
You're dead!

1:49:26.268 --> 1:49:27.394
Tae-gu…

1:49:28.353 --> 1:49:31.189
Don't say my name, asshole…

1:49:34.067 --> 1:49:36.319
I'm taking you with me.

1:49:38.029 --> 1:49:40.240
We're going to hell together.

1:49:51.334 --> 1:49:53.795
No! Please!

1:50:14.399 --> 1:50:15.608
Bastard…

1:50:29.748 --> 1:50:31.499
You son of a bitch!

1:50:32.250 --> 1:50:35.253
You had your fun.

1:50:36.171 --> 1:50:37.964
If I had it my way,

1:50:39.090 --> 1:50:40.884
I'd let you take him

1:50:40.967 --> 1:50:43.887
as a gesture of good faith from us.

1:50:45.638 --> 1:50:48.767
But if that fucker dies,
we'll have more problems.

1:50:55.982 --> 1:50:57.192
Tae-gu.

1:50:59.944 --> 1:51:01.613
Let's settle the score here.

1:51:41.236 --> 1:51:42.654
No!

1:51:42.737 --> 1:51:46.157
Please, don't!

1:51:49.619 --> 1:51:50.912
Don't do it!

1:51:53.915 --> 1:51:55.166
Don't…

1:52:13.309 --> 1:52:14.769
Why are you crying?

1:52:16.729 --> 1:52:18.022
Don't waste…

1:52:21.151 --> 1:52:22.485
your tears.

1:52:26.489 --> 1:52:28.074
I'm not crying.

1:52:28.158 --> 1:52:29.492
Why would I?

1:52:31.870 --> 1:52:32.954
You're not my type.

1:52:33.997 --> 1:52:35.665
Why'd anyone cry over you?

1:52:38.126 --> 1:52:39.043
Hey.

1:52:40.712 --> 1:52:42.088
Don't give me that shit.

1:52:45.550 --> 1:52:46.634
Looks like…

1:52:48.928 --> 1:52:50.388
I'm dying

1:52:51.890 --> 1:52:53.016
before you.

1:52:54.434 --> 1:52:55.393
You little punk.

1:52:57.562 --> 1:52:58.605
What a petty bastard.

1:52:59.606 --> 1:53:01.649
That's what you were thinking about?

1:53:03.318 --> 1:53:07.322
No need to boast,
I'll join you in a few days.

1:53:10.533 --> 1:53:13.495
I knew…

1:53:15.455 --> 1:53:17.749
you'd say something like that.

1:53:34.599 --> 1:53:37.977
Please go away, he's just about dead!

1:53:38.061 --> 1:53:41.606
-Go away! Please!
-Yes, he's dead anyway!

1:53:42.398 --> 1:53:43.441
Piss off!

1:53:43.942 --> 1:53:45.652
How dare you bite me!

1:53:47.779 --> 1:53:49.531
What a psycho bitch.

1:53:51.950 --> 1:53:54.786
Fuck, that hurts.

1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:10.426
Tae-gu.

1:54:12.512 --> 1:54:13.888
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

1:54:16.641 --> 1:54:18.309
I'll make the pain go away.

1:55:20.622 --> 1:55:22.290
All right, wrap it up.

1:55:22.999 --> 1:55:24.292
What about the girl, sir?

1:55:26.544 --> 1:55:28.212
Isn't it obvious, you idiot?

1:55:28.296 --> 1:55:30.882
Chief Ma, I'll do it.

1:55:30.965 --> 1:55:32.091
Give me a knife.

1:55:33.635 --> 1:55:36.512
I already drew blood,
I'll take care of her.

1:55:36.596 --> 1:55:39.098
Let her be.

1:55:39.807 --> 1:55:41.267
I made a promise.

1:55:41.976 --> 1:55:44.979
She said she won't live long anyway.

1:55:45.063 --> 1:55:46.272
What a heartless bastard.

1:55:46.856 --> 1:55:48.900
That's why she should die.
Because she won't…

1:55:48.983 --> 1:55:51.694
I said that's enough, fucker!

1:55:52.654 --> 1:55:54.614
I've had it with you!

1:55:54.697 --> 1:55:55.823
Okay.

1:55:55.907 --> 1:55:57.450
Look at yourself!

1:55:57.533 --> 1:56:00.536
You should be the one dead on the ground!

1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:02.956
Get that pest out of my sight.

1:56:03.039 --> 1:56:05.208
Get rid of him!

1:56:05.291 --> 1:56:08.336
My jacket, can you bring my jacket?

1:56:13.091 --> 1:56:14.676
Fuck…

1:56:16.427 --> 1:56:18.137
Fuck!

1:56:26.479 --> 1:56:28.606
Where are we staying tonight?

1:56:28.690 --> 1:56:30.149
I need to lie down.

1:58:18.674 --> 1:58:20.259
They went to get breakfast?

1:58:21.302 --> 1:58:22.386
A seafood restaurant?

1:58:23.763 --> 1:58:25.848
Which one did you recommend?

1:58:27.141 --> 1:58:30.686
Thank you, sir.

2:00:00.401 --> 2:00:01.360
What a fucking loser.

2:00:06.782 --> 2:00:08.743
More booze is best for a hangover.

2:00:22.798 --> 2:00:25.551
Look who it is.

2:00:26.302 --> 2:00:27.803
Did you come for breakfast?

2:00:28.638 --> 2:00:30.681
Too bad though, it's a full house.

2:00:32.266 --> 2:00:34.227
She can sit on my lap!

2:00:34.310 --> 2:00:36.604
Came to get your uncle's body?

2:00:36.687 --> 2:00:37.772
Why don't you

2:00:38.522 --> 2:00:40.107
join us at our table?

2:00:41.567 --> 2:00:44.946
We're not strangers, we can share a drink.

2:00:46.113 --> 2:00:49.158
Come, join us. It's okay.

2:00:50.034 --> 2:00:53.579
We're not as scary as we look!

2:00:53.663 --> 2:00:56.082
-Over here.
-I'll buy you breakfast.

2:00:56.165 --> 2:00:57.124
Don't be so sad!

2:00:57.208 --> 2:00:58.459
Come here!

2:00:58.542 --> 2:01:00.211
Fuck…

2:01:15.101 --> 2:01:16.352
I lost my appetite.

2:01:17.228 --> 2:01:18.562
Get fucked, asshole.

2:01:28.239 --> 2:01:29.240
Fuck!

2:01:47.174 --> 2:01:48.384
Shit!

2:02:06.944 --> 2:02:07.945
Close it!

2:02:08.696 --> 2:02:10.781
Fucking cowards.

2:02:11.532 --> 2:02:14.910
Shitheads, this door isn't bulletproof.

2:02:16.078 --> 2:02:18.789
She's not firing pellets.

2:02:33.304 --> 2:02:34.430
Okay.

2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:38.309
Come to think of it,

2:02:39.727 --> 2:02:41.103
you and I

2:02:43.814 --> 2:02:45.524
have a score to settle.

2:02:52.823 --> 2:02:54.200
Is she fucking nuts?

2:03:30.444 --> 2:03:31.779
Fuck…

2:03:33.239 --> 2:03:34.740
Goddamn…

2:03:46.961 --> 2:03:49.296
Wait…

2:03:50.923 --> 2:03:52.800
Wait, please…

2:03:52.883 --> 2:03:55.511
Let's talk…

2:03:55.594 --> 2:03:56.595
Please…

2:03:56.679 --> 2:03:57.805
Talk…

2:11:16.827 --> 2:11:21.832
