01:59.911 --> 02:04.708
<i>Sections 2 and 3 of the east wing</i>
<i>will be shut down today at 1800 hours.</i>

02:05.167 --> 02:08.712
<i>Please complete all patient transfers</i>
<i>by 1600 hours today.</i>

02:09.796 --> 02:12.716
I'm afraid of Ms. Misato and Ayanami...

02:14.801 --> 02:17.804
Help me. Please help me, Asuka...

02:22.309 --> 02:24.436
Come on... Wake up.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.104
Come on!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.024
Wake up...

02:30.734 --> 02:32.819
Come on... Come on!

02:32.903 --> 02:34.112
Asuka!

02:43.288 --> 02:44.456
Help me...

02:45.499 --> 02:46.708
Please help me...

02:48.168 --> 02:49.294
Help...

02:50.045 --> 02:51.296
Help me...

02:54.675 --> 02:58.220
Make fun of me like you always do!

02:59.471 --> 03:00.305
Come on!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.645
I'm the lowest of the low...

03:52.149 --> 03:55.235
A complete lockdown of headquarters?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.612
And still at alert condition one?

03:57.696 --> 04:00.991
But why?
That boy was the final Angel, right?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.202
Yeah, that should be
the last of the Angels.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.913
Doesn't that mean the crisis is over?

04:07.122 --> 04:09.124
Then what about NERV HQ?
What about the Evas?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.835
And Senpai isn't here...

04:11.918 --> 04:14.463
I think NERV will be disbanded.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.257
I have no idea what will happen to us.

04:18.049 --> 04:22.095
We'll have to tough it out
until the Instrumentality Project starts.

04:26.349 --> 04:30.061
The Human Instrumentality Project,
meant to artificially evolve humanity,

04:30.187 --> 04:32.564
a flawed colony organism
that's hit an impasse,

04:32.647 --> 04:34.399
into a perfect single lifeform.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.735
Talk about paradise on Earth...

04:37.194 --> 04:43.241
The Council intends to use an Eva
to enact it, not Adam or NERV.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.077
Just like Kaji predicted.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.371
The promised time is upon us.

04:48.455 --> 04:53.585
With the Spear of Longinus lost,
Lilith cannot be our Instrumentality.

04:53.668 --> 04:58.965
Our hopes rest on Unit 01,
the sole offspring of Lilith.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.134
That deviates from Seele's scenario.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.722
The purpose of man's existence
was to give birth to the Evas.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.226
Humanity must advance to a new world.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.812
The Eva series will do that.

05:11.895 --> 05:16.817
We needn't abandon our human form
in order to board Eva's ark.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.069
This is a rite of passage,

05:19.152 --> 05:22.322
one necessary to reinvigorate
the stagnated human race.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.826
The fate of extinction also contains
the rapture of new birth.

05:25.909 --> 05:31.248
Through death, God, man,
and all lifeforms will at last become one.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.667
Death produces nothing.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.294
Death is what we shall grant you.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.925
Humanity finds meaning
in the struggle for survival.

05:42.717 --> 05:46.596
That was her hope when she chose
to remain within the Eva.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.330
Well, well. So this is the real story
behind the Second Impact.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.541
Did they spot me?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.463
No, it's something else.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.674
It's starting.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.929
<i>Link to Network No. 6 is down!</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:12.098
Change the left one to the blue
emergency comm channel!

07:12.182 --> 07:15.644
Open a satellite link if you must!
How's the right one doing?

07:15.727 --> 07:18.939
<i>Communication to all outside networks</i>
<i>and data feeds have been severed!</i>

07:20.315 --> 07:21.775
They're after the Magi?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.569
Data intrusion
from all external terminals!

07:24.653 --> 07:26.780
They're trying to hack into the Magi!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.742
As I thought. Is it coming from
the Magi 02 at Matsushiro?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.036
No, I'm detecting at least
five Magi types!

07:33.536 --> 07:36.039
Confirming intrusions from Germany,
China and the US!

07:36.748 --> 07:38.667
Seele is going all-out.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.337
We're outnumbered five to one.
Bad odds, indeed.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.839
<i>No. 4 firewall breached!</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:47.717
Quarantining main database!
It's not working!

07:47.801 --> 07:51.012
-I can't halt the intrusion!
-Further intrusion in exterior blocks!

07:51.096 --> 07:53.348
Backup circuits unable to halt advance!

07:53.807 --> 07:58.144
<i>Not good. Commandeering the Magi</i>
<i>is the same as occupying HQ.</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:03.191
<i>This is a condition two alert.</i>

08:03.274 --> 08:06.319
<i>I repeat, all personnel report</i>
<i>to alert condition two stations.</i>

08:07.612 --> 08:08.571
<i>Man your positions...</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:11.950
Let me guess.
The Magi's autonomous defenses?

08:12.742 --> 08:16.204
Yes. Lt. Ibuki at Secondary
Command Center will fill you in.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.000
He'll even use a woman
he's cast aside if need be?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.711
Such an egotistical man...

08:23.795 --> 08:26.172
<i>A condition two alert</i>
<i>is currently in effect.</i>

08:26.798 --> 08:28.550
-Sit-rep.
-<i>Good morning, ma'am.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:33.096
-<i>Tokyo-2 just issued an A-801.</i>
-A-801?

08:33.179 --> 08:36.766
<i>NERV has been stripped</i>
<i>of legal protections,</i>

08:36.850 --> 08:39.144
<i>and the Japanese government</i>
<i>has assumed control.</i>

08:41.021 --> 08:42.397
It's their ultimatum.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.192
That's right, ma'am.
The Magi are being hacked.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.444
We're on the ropes.

08:48.069 --> 08:52.157
Ibuki here. Dr. Akagi is beefing up
our network security.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.494
She's what?

08:58.246 --> 09:01.416
DO NOT STEP!
WILL BUCKLE

09:06.671 --> 09:09.299
<i>Am I being a fool?</i>

09:10.008 --> 09:12.844
<i>It's so illogical,</i>
<i>the way men and women interact.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:16.556
Isn't that right...

09:18.600 --> 09:19.768
Mother?

09:20.643 --> 09:24.189
<i>Goura landlines have recovered to 0.2%.</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:25.440
How much more?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.736
It looks like we'll make it.
Dr. Akagi is amazing as ever.

09:29.819 --> 09:34.032
<i>Would they stop at hacking the Magi?</i>
<i>These guys don't play softball.</i>

09:34.282 --> 09:35.116
<i>I bet...</i>

09:35.200 --> 09:39.079
The Magi attack is just the first round.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.832
They want to secure HQ and the two Evas.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.587
Yes, since we have both Lilith and Adam.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.340
That'd certainly make
the old men nervous.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.137
Hacking against the Magi has stopped.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.556
Danang Type B Firewall erected!

09:58.640 --> 10:01.434
External intrusion will be impossible
for the next 62 hours.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.944
See you soon, Mother.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.907
Ikari has used Code 666
network protection on the Magi.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.118
Breaching it will be difficult.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.579
We have no choice but to abort
our attempt to take over the Magi.

10:21.663 --> 10:26.417
We wanted to do this peacefully,
but it seems we have no choice.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.546
We shall attack and seize
their HQ complex itself.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.391
Let's get started. Stick to the timetable.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.590
Radar sites no. 8 through 17
have gone dark!

11:14.174 --> 11:16.801
<i>An artillery battalion has breached</i>
<i>the Goura Defense Line!</i>

11:16.885 --> 11:19.512
<i>Two other battalions are approaching</i>
<i>from the Gotenba area!</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:24.225
As we feared, our final enemy
turned out to be our fellow man.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.061
All personnel,
condition one battle stations.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.354
Battle stations?

11:29.981 --> 11:33.276
But they're not Angels.
They're humans, just like us!

11:33.860 --> 11:35.612
They won't have the same reservations.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.013
-What is it? Hey!
-What's going on?

12:02.680 --> 12:03.932
It's the south hub station.

12:16.444 --> 12:20.156
-<i>Daigatake tunnel impassable!</i>
-<i>Fires in west no. 5 access corridor!</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:22.867
<i>Intruding force has infiltrated Level 1!</i>

12:23.826 --> 12:25.787
The units in the west annex
are a diversion!

12:25.870 --> 12:28.498
If they want to secure the Evas,
they'll kill the pilots.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.584
-Get Shinji into Unit 01 immediately.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.795
-Where's Asuka?
-Hospital room 303.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.006
Go ahead and put her into Unit 02.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.385
But she still can't synchronize
with her Eva!

12:40.969 --> 12:45.181
She's as good as dead there.
Better to stash her in her Eva.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.099
Roger.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.892
Halt the pilot's meds!

12:47.976 --> 12:50.979
Once Asuka's inside, hide Unit 02
at the bottom of the lake.

12:51.062 --> 12:54.148
They'll find her in no time,
but better there than the cage. And Rei?

12:54.232 --> 12:56.859
Whereabouts unknown. We can't find her.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.238
They'll kill her. Find her, and fast.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.093
Launching Unit 02! Will use Route No. 8
and anchor her 70 meters down.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.139
Now launch Unit 01!
Station it inside the Geo-front!

13:26.222 --> 13:28.057
No-go, ma'am! Cannot locate the pilot!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.603
Oh, no...

13:32.687 --> 13:35.732
<i>Closing all blast doors</i>
<i>up to Central Dogma Level 2.</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:39.152
<i>All noncombatants,</i>
<i>evacuate using corridor 87.</i>

13:44.699 --> 13:48.202
No. 3 underground blast door destroyed!
Level 2 has been breached!

13:48.953 --> 13:51.247
They must have deployed
a division-size SSDF force.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.666
We'll be overrun eventually.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.920
Would you look after things,
Prof. Fuyutsuki?

13:58.504 --> 14:01.424
I understand. Give my best to Yui.

14:25.740 --> 14:29.786
-<i>Group 2 not responding!</i>
-<i>Mainframe Room no. 77, contact lost!</i>

14:30.370 --> 14:32.622
Maglev line no. 52 demolished!

14:32.872 --> 14:35.792
What a sick joke. These guys
make the Angels look like amateurs!

14:36.376 --> 14:39.962
<i>It's only natural.</i>
<i>Our side isn't used to killing humans.</i>

14:50.807 --> 14:52.475
Sever the red cables first!

14:59.440 --> 15:02.944
Intruders in Level 3, Block B!
They can't hold them off!

15:03.236 --> 15:06.072
From Block F, too! The main bypass
is being hit from two sides!

15:07.115 --> 15:10.159
Abandon Level 3 and above!
Pull back our combat forces!

15:10.701 --> 15:14.205
Pump Bakelite into all passageways
and exchange pipes up to Sector 803!

15:14.288 --> 15:15.498
Yes, ma'am!

15:15.581 --> 15:19.669
<i>Flooding Bakelite from no. 703.</i>
<i>Process will be complete in 30.</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:22.713
<i>Flooding Bakelite from no. 703...</i>

15:23.297 --> 15:24.966
That should hold for a while.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.344
Major Katsuragi! Route 47 has been cut,

15:28.428 --> 15:31.764
and Group 3 is stuck!
At this rate, Shinji's will be killed!

15:38.729 --> 15:41.399
Noncombatants should avoid
close-quarters combat.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.651
They're pros.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.488
Anyone who can't retreat
to the Dogma should surrender.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.242
-Sorry, take care of things here.
-Yes, ma'am.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.831
-Forget Mt. Futago, seal off Nagao-touge.
-This is harder than I expected.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.750
They don't give us the easy jobs.

16:00.460 --> 16:06.048
We're at a disadvantage. We don't have
decent antipersonnel defenses.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.384
Just basic counter-terrorism stuff.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.638
If the SSDF put their mind to it,
this complex would be toast in no time.

16:13.306 --> 16:18.603
Maybe this is why
our intruder prevention budget was cut.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.563
That's plausible...

16:32.033 --> 16:33.201
Switch the safety off.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.122
I... I can't shoot one of these.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.458
You've done it lots of times!

16:40.541 --> 16:43.628
That was at targets, not people!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.714
Get over it! It's kill, or be killed!

17:02.480 --> 17:03.481
Rei.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.323
I thought you might be here.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.959
The promised time has come. Let's go.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.089
Level 2 completely secured, over.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.425
<i>Secondary Command Center</i>
<i>and Magi original not yet secured.</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:33.553
<i>Engaging from SCC lower level, west side.</i>

17:33.928 --> 17:37.223
<i>Begin cooling cycle</i>
<i>on 5th Bolgia immediately.</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:46.983
<i>Terminate Eva pilots on sight.</i>
<i>Weapons free on non-hostiles.</i>

17:47.149 --> 17:50.236
<i>Yanagihara Force and Shinjyo Force,</i>
<i>breach into the lower levels now!</i>

17:55.908 --> 17:58.119
Third Children found. Will neutralize.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.873
Nothing personal, kid.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.175
Hey, nothing personal.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.017
Come on. Let's get you to Unit 01.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.021
<i>Yamagishi Detachment,</i>
<i>report cage no. 7 status.</i>

18:25.771 --> 18:29.734
<i>Secured the Purple one.</i>
<i>Bakelite injection and flooding complete.</i>

18:30.401 --> 18:33.696
<i>Red one seems to have been launched.</i>
<i>Determining launch route.</i>

18:33.779 --> 18:39.076
This is bad. They're trying to keep
Unit 01 and Shinji physically separated.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.329
There's no time to lose.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.914
Let's get moving, Shinji.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.629
Decide. Will you run away from here
or towards Unit 01?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.507
If you just sit here, you're going to die!

18:54.091 --> 18:56.469
Help me, Asuka... Help me...

18:56.886 --> 19:00.931
Turning to a girl
to escape a harsh reality

19:01.015 --> 19:02.975
is the worst kind of being half-assed!

19:04.769 --> 19:06.437
Come on, stand up!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.939
Stand!

19:09.732 --> 19:13.527
I'm done. I want to die.
I don't want to do anything.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.738
This is no time to act like a baby!

19:16.489 --> 19:17.907
You're still alive, damn it!

19:17.990 --> 19:21.118
Live your life on your feet,
and then you can die!

19:24.872 --> 19:28.834
Never mind us,
severing the Terminal Dogma has priority!

19:33.547 --> 19:36.926
They've used explosives
everywhere else, but not here!

19:37.510 --> 19:41.806
I bet they want to, but can't,
with the Magi originals below us.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.017
They must want to secure them
with as little damage as possible.

19:45.101 --> 19:49.063
But we don't have many bio-chem defenses.
We'd be screwed.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.648
N2 ordnances, too.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.425
-You had to say it!
-Have they ever heard of restraint?!

20:18.259 --> 20:19.260
How rash...

20:26.350 --> 20:28.561
Why do they want the Evas so badly?!

20:29.562 --> 20:34.066
They want to trigger the Third Impact,
but with the Eva series, not an Angel.

20:35.276 --> 20:39.280
The Second Impact 15 years ago
was set off by mankind.

20:39.864 --> 20:43.075
But that was an attempt
to minimize the damage

20:43.159 --> 20:48.789
by regressing Adam to an egg state
before the other Angels could awaken.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.500
Listen carefully, Shinji.

20:51.834 --> 20:58.340
Like Adam, we humans also come
from the source of life called Lilith.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.217
We're the 18th Angel.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.304
The other Angels were humanities
that might have been,

21:03.971 --> 21:05.598
ones free of human form.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.519
But we're all tragic beings
who had to reject each other.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.855
Our fellow humans.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.277
Listen, Shinji, you need to destroy
the entire Eva series.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.238
It's our only hope of survival.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.617
The phones are down?

21:25.409 --> 21:29.038
Yes, we received confirmation
of the missile detonation minutes ago.

21:29.497 --> 21:33.375
This covert Human Instrumentality
Project of NERV's...

21:34.126 --> 21:38.589
To think their goal was triggering
the Third Impact and obliterating mankind.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.800
It's unbelievable.

21:40.883 --> 21:45.054
Man must be the only creature
capable of such hatred for its own kind.

21:45.429 --> 21:49.850
Now, what to do with the NERV HQ complex?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.937
Subcontract its redevelopment
to the Germans or Chinese?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.272
They would haggle us to death.

21:55.356 --> 21:59.527
We'll shut it down for 20 years,
I suppose. Just like Old Tokyo.

22:02.530 --> 22:06.200
<i>Surface heat has dissipated.</i>
<i>No high-pressure steam risk, either.</i>

22:06.700 --> 22:08.828
<i>All units now in initial positions.</i>

22:09.411 --> 22:13.165
We currently have Dogma Level 3
and the purple one secured.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.416
What about the red one?

22:14.875 --> 22:19.547
Located in the underground lake,
depth 70. Pilot status unknown.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.185
<i>I'm alive?</i>

22:52.913 --> 22:54.748
I don't want to die...

23:19.356 --> 23:22.610
-I don't want to die...
-<i>You must keep living.</i>

23:23.569 --> 23:26.280
-I don't want to die...
-<i>You mustn't die, not yet.</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:30.034
-I don't want to die...
-<i>You must keep living.</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:35.247
-<i>I won't let you die.</i>
-<i>Don't die.</i>

23:35.372 --> 23:38.667
-<i>I won't let them kill you.</i>
-<i>You must keep living.</i>

23:40.085 --> 23:43.881
-<i>I won't let you die.</i>
-<i>You mustn't die, not yet.</i>

23:46.008 --> 23:49.094
-<i>We will die together!</i>
-<i>You mustn't die.</i>

23:50.721 --> 23:54.892
-<i>Die with me!</i>
-<i>Don't kill her!</i>

23:56.143 --> 23:59.188
<i>You must keep living!</i>

23:59.855 --> 24:02.983
I don't want to die!

24:07.696 --> 24:10.407
Mommy, this is where you were!

24:16.956 --> 24:17.790
Mom!

24:25.798 --> 24:27.466
-What the hell?
-Did we kill it?

24:57.788 --> 25:01.083
<i>Mom! I understand now, Mom!</i>

25:03.252 --> 25:04.837
<i>I know what the A.T. Field is!</i>

25:07.423 --> 25:09.174
<i>You're protecting me!</i>

25:12.302 --> 25:13.971
<i>You're watching over me!</i>

25:29.528 --> 25:33.365
You were with me this whole time,
weren't you, Mom?

25:36.577 --> 25:40.205
<i>Eva Unit 02 has activated!</i>
<i>Asuka's okay! She's alive!</i>

25:40.289 --> 25:41.331
She's what?!

25:45.252 --> 25:49.715
The cable! That's its power cable!
Concentrate all fire on it!

25:54.553 --> 25:56.472
Even without my umbilical cable...

25:57.681 --> 26:00.559
I've still got 12,000 layers
of special armor...

26:03.604 --> 26:05.731
and an A.T. Field!

26:09.985 --> 26:12.154
I'm not about to lose...

26:14.740 --> 26:16.867
to the likes of you!

26:39.181 --> 26:41.225
<i>The Eva abominations...</i>

26:41.975 --> 26:44.937
Once again, they are a thorn in our side.

26:45.020 --> 26:49.566
It would seem that we must
fight fire with fire.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.182
The Eva series?
They were already completed?

27:29.731 --> 27:33.902
Committing all nine
S2 Drive-equipped Evas?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.362
That's a bit excessive...

27:36.113 --> 27:38.574
Unless... Do they intend
to set it off here?!

27:58.260 --> 28:02.055
Asuka, you absolutely have to
annihilate the Eva series.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.392
I'll send Shinji up in a sec.
Hang in there.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.813
So, we can still reach Eva Unit 01
via emergency Route 20?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.608
<i>Yes, I have triple redundancies</i>
<i>for the power.</i>

28:12.774 --> 28:16.028
<i>Get there in three minutes,</i>
<i>and you have a direct route to cage no. 7.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:32.878
"Annihilate them," she says...

28:34.254 --> 28:36.965
That's a lot to ask of someone
who was just comatose.

28:38.508 --> 28:43.096
Nine in three minutes, 30 seconds.
That's just 20 seconds each!

29:03.825 --> 29:04.660
<i>Erste!</i>

29:12.834 --> 29:13.835
This is it.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.428
They got away?

29:23.804 --> 29:26.765
Unable to neutralize target.
Should we pursue?

29:27.307 --> 29:31.061
<i>Negative, we're going to blow that area.</i>
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

29:31.645 --> 29:32.479
Roger.

29:34.898 --> 29:38.193
That should... buy us some time.

29:42.739 --> 29:46.618
I'm okay. It's not as bad as it looks.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.460
The power's on. You'll make it.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.427
Listen, Shinji.

30:04.094 --> 30:07.723
What you do next,
you need to decide on your own.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.224
You can't ask for help.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.811
No, I can't.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.188
I'm worthless.

30:16.189 --> 30:21.820
Piloting an Eva and hurting or killing
people... I don't have the right.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.199
I thought that piloting it was all I had.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.785
But I was kidding myself.

30:29.119 --> 30:32.205
There's no point in someone
as ignorant as me piloting an Eva.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.459
What can I possibly do
that would help others?

30:37.669 --> 30:42.174
I did terrible things to Asuka.
I even killed Kaworu.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.802
I don't have a shred of decency.
I'm just a sneak and a coward.

30:46.303 --> 30:50.432
All I do is hurt people.
So it's better if I don't do anything!

30:51.141 --> 30:56.313
You'll get no pity from me. If you want
to avoid pain, just curl up and die.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.275
Crying now won't help!

31:03.570 --> 31:07.783
You hate yourself, don't you?
That's why you hurt others.

31:08.283 --> 31:12.704
You know that hurting others
hurts you more than it hurts them.

31:13.288 --> 31:18.377
But no matter what lies ahead, it will be
the result of your own decisions.

31:18.502 --> 31:22.297
That means something, Shinji!
It means you made a difference!

31:22.923 --> 31:28.804
Don't lie to yourself, think about
what you can do, and make amends.

31:30.097 --> 31:34.351
You're just a stranger, Ms. Misato!
You don't know anything about me!

31:36.186 --> 31:39.856
So what if I am a stranger?
You just want to give up?!

31:40.440 --> 31:44.903
If you don't do anything now,
I'll never forgive you!

31:44.986 --> 31:47.155
I'll never forgive you
for as long as I live!

31:47.864 --> 31:49.950
You won't always be who you are now.

31:50.242 --> 31:55.414
You'll learn that you made mistakes
and regret them. That's me in a nutshell.

31:56.289 --> 31:59.251
A cycle of false elation
and self-loathing.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.587
But each time,
I made a little more progress.

32:04.214 --> 32:08.218
Listen, Shinji, pilot your Eva again
and figure things out.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.178
With the you who piloted the Eva.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.559
Why you came here.
What you were meant to do here.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.811
Figure out who you are now.

32:18.645 --> 32:23.859
And when you've worked it out,
make sure you come back.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.284
Promise me.

32:34.035 --> 32:34.870
Okay...

32:35.954 --> 32:37.122
See you soon.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.139
That's how grown-ups kiss.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.517
There's more in store when you get back.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.700
If I'd known this would happen...

33:15.243 --> 33:21.124
I should have gotten a new carpet
like Asuka said.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.085
Right, Pen Pen?

33:26.463 --> 33:31.051
Kaji... I did the right thing, right?

34:55.427 --> 34:58.263
<i>Back off, damn it!</i>

34:58.346 --> 35:01.016
<i>You can never count on</i>
<i>that idiot Shinji!</i>

35:36.134 --> 35:37.552
I've been waiting for you.

36:17.592 --> 36:18.927
I'm sorry.

36:20.261 --> 36:24.474
I took the liberty of altering
the Magi's programming earlier.

36:26.059 --> 36:31.064
This is my last request.
Mother, please die with me.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.865
It didn't go off? Why?!

36:40.949 --> 36:42.075
DENIED

36:42.909 --> 36:44.077
Casper has betrayed me?!

36:44.703 --> 36:47.789
Mother, you chose your lover
over your own daughter?

36:50.542 --> 36:54.254
Ritsuko Akagi, I really did...

37:01.928 --> 37:02.887
Liar.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.732
What's happening outside?!

37:14.274 --> 37:17.527
Less than one minute until Unit 02
runs empty! Asuka won't make it!

37:22.949 --> 37:24.492
I'm not about to be defeated!

37:25.118 --> 37:26.661
<i>Not with Mom watching!</i>

37:30.165 --> 37:31.124
Mom?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.209
Mother...

37:38.590 --> 37:41.134
This one's the last!

38:05.450 --> 38:06.951
The Spear of Longinus?!

38:30.975 --> 38:35.063
Internal power depleted...
Operational limit reached.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.398
Eva Unit 02 has gone silent...

38:40.235 --> 38:41.152
What's this?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.322
The Eva series units
she killed, they're...

38:59.587 --> 39:01.464
Eva series has reactivated.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.141
They're going to finish her off?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.490
-What's going on?!
-I can't watch anymore!

39:28.491 --> 39:30.785
I don't want to watch!

39:30.869 --> 39:32.412
That's... Unit 02?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.054
I'll kill you...

39:52.348 --> 39:58.062
I'll kill you...

40:03.443 --> 40:06.946
I'll kill you...

40:12.035 --> 40:16.039
-Is it going berserk?!
-Asuka, please, stop!

40:17.040 --> 40:19.500
I'll kill you...

40:34.557 --> 40:37.727
<i>Shinji! Unit 02 is...</i>

40:37.810 --> 40:40.063
<i>Asuka is... Asuka is...</i>

40:40.146 --> 40:41.606
But I can't get into my Eva.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.233
There's nothing I can do.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.163
Mother...?

41:01.167 --> 41:03.002
Unit 01 must have activated.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.439
Evangelion Unit 01...

41:23.523 --> 41:24.857
It's the devil incarnate!

41:37.036 --> 41:38.121
Asuka?

41:53.636 --> 41:56.764
TO BE CONTINUED

46:44.844 --> 46:47.513
I would like to extend my deepest
gratitude to the staff, cast, friends,

46:47.596 --> 46:50.391
and five women who helped guide this
motion picture to its finale once again.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.184
Thank you very much. - Hideaki Anno

46:55.980 --> 46:58.482
I am already one with Adam.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.777
This is the only way
to be reunited with Yui.

47:02.236 --> 47:05.948
Only through the forbidden union
of Adam and Lilith.

47:08.534 --> 47:13.164
We're running out of time.
Your A.T. Field can't maintain your form.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.499
Let's begin, Rei.

47:16.459 --> 47:19.837
Bring down our A.T. Fields,
the walls of the heart.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.881
Make our hearts whole.

47:22.048 --> 47:26.302
Cast aside our unneeded flesh,
unify all souls into one,

47:26.969 --> 47:29.430
and let us go to where Yui awaits.

47:57.333 --> 47:58.417
Asuka?

48:10.221 --> 48:11.180
<i>Shinji?</i>

48:20.022 --> 48:22.566
High-velocity object
approaching from space!

48:22.733 --> 48:23.901
What?!

48:26.654 --> 48:28.614
No! The Spear of Longinus?

48:38.707 --> 48:41.127
At last, our wish will be granted.

48:41.210 --> 48:45.089
The original Spear of Longinus
has returned.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.843
Our numbers may be short,
but this will have to do.

48:49.677 --> 48:53.097
Return the Eva series to their real form.

48:53.806 --> 48:58.686
The true form which brings
the gospel to humanity.

48:59.270 --> 49:04.692
With death and prayer in equal measure,
return man to his true form.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.445
Only then will our souls know peace.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.614
Now, let the ceremony begin.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.339
Eva Unit 01 is being abducted!

49:27.423 --> 49:30.593
Altitude, 12,000 and climbing!

49:31.177 --> 49:34.472
The bastards. Seele must want to make
Unit 01 the sacrificial medium.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.526
The stigmata have been
branded upon Eva Unit 01.

49:47.943 --> 49:51.071
Resurrect now the Central Tree.

49:51.697 --> 49:54.325
Our servants, the Eva series...

49:55.284 --> 49:57.578
were created for this day.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.881
Eva series S2 Drives overloading!

50:08.964 --> 50:11.467
Dimensional measurements inverted!
They're showing negative!

50:12.009 --> 50:14.094
Monitoring has failed! Unable to quantify!

50:14.887 --> 50:16.597
Anti-A.T. Fields...

50:21.685 --> 50:24.230
This is all just like 15 years ago.

50:24.855 --> 50:28.859
Then this really is the lead-up
to the Third Impact?

50:35.157 --> 50:39.745
-S2 Drives have reached critical!
-Intermolecular force breaking down!

50:40.913 --> 50:43.249
Well, this operation was a failure.

50:51.340 --> 50:53.634
Direct hit!
Surface sedimentary layer liquefied!

50:54.385 --> 50:58.389
Secondary blast is excavating HQ!
Outer shell is being exposed!

51:02.977 --> 51:07.481
It's still just a physical shock wave!
Absorbers at full power will handle it!

51:21.829 --> 51:26.458
-With the purification of...
-...the red earth symbolizing eternity...

51:27.209 --> 51:31.046
-...begin by restoring...
-...the Geo-front to its true form.

51:39.805 --> 51:44.226
The origin of human life, Lilith's Egg.

51:44.351 --> 51:45.352
The Black Moon.

51:46.562 --> 51:50.316
Crawling back into the shell
holds no appeal.

51:51.317 --> 51:54.278
But that is up to Lilith, I suppose.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.990
It appears the process has begun.

51:58.532 --> 52:03.162
Now, Rei, guide me to Yui.

52:03.829 --> 52:04.830
What?!

52:05.456 --> 52:07.833
I'm not your doll.

52:09.918 --> 52:10.753
Why?!

52:11.253 --> 52:13.213
Because I am not you.

52:15.758 --> 52:16.842
Rei!

52:22.181 --> 52:25.184
I beg you! Wait, Rei!

52:25.809 --> 52:28.312
No, Shinji is calling for me.

52:29.104 --> 52:30.105
Rei!

52:35.361 --> 52:36.236
I'm home.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.863
"WELCOME BACK."
I'M HOME.

53:26.412 --> 53:27.246
Rei...

53:27.788 --> 53:31.792
Unknown high-energy object is rapidly
approaching from the Terminal Dogma!

53:31.875 --> 53:34.753
A.T. Field confirmed! Pattern Blue!

53:35.254 --> 53:36.338
What, an Angel?!

53:36.422 --> 53:39.466
No, it's a person! A human!

53:53.480 --> 53:54.481
No!

53:55.649 --> 53:57.192
No!

54:11.999 --> 54:15.711
Damn it...

54:36.732 --> 54:37.649
Rei...

54:40.027 --> 54:41.278
...Ayanami?

54:49.703 --> 54:56.168
With the shattered ego of Eva-01's pilot,
instrumentality will make mankind whole.

54:56.251 --> 54:59.671
The time of the third tribulation
is now at hand.

55:07.888 --> 55:10.599
The A.T. Fields of the Eva series
are resonating!

55:10.682 --> 55:12.351
They're being amplified!

55:12.893 --> 55:14.603
They've begun to synchronize with Rei?

55:37.543 --> 55:41.547
-Psychograph is flatlining!
-Destrudo materializing!

55:42.214 --> 55:45.551
The pilot's ego is at its breaking point.

55:48.053 --> 55:49.096
No more...

56:03.735 --> 56:04.987
Are you alright?

56:07.865 --> 56:10.284
This is where you were, Kaworu?

56:34.391 --> 56:38.145
Solenoid graph inverted!
Ego boundary weakening!

56:38.228 --> 56:40.522
A.T. Field has changed to Pattern Red!

56:41.398 --> 56:45.986
The Angels' Fruit of Life
and man's Fruit of Knowledge...

56:46.737 --> 56:50.115
Having obtained both, Eva Unit 01

56:50.282 --> 56:52.534
has become a being equivalent to God.

56:54.077 --> 56:59.166
And it is now reverting
to the Tree of Life, the proto-embryo.

56:59.708 --> 57:04.796
Will it become the ark that saves man
from the oblivion of the Third Impact,

57:05.172 --> 57:07.549
or the devil that will destroy it?

57:08.133 --> 57:11.053
We've placed our future
in the hands of Ikari's son.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.139
We... We did the right thing, right?

57:14.222 --> 57:15.557
How should I know?!

57:19.978 --> 57:23.190
<i>This Rei is your heart.</i>

57:23.941 --> 57:26.443
The embodiment of your wishes.

57:27.402 --> 57:28.654
What do you wish for?

57:55.305 --> 57:59.851
Oh, right... This is just like
when I started playing the cello.

58:01.395 --> 58:05.190
I thought I might find something
if I came here.

58:06.650 --> 58:11.405
Play with us, Shinji!
Let's work together to finish our castle!

58:13.281 --> 58:14.282
Yeah!

58:28.171 --> 58:30.465
-Look, it's Mommy!
-Time to go home!

58:30.549 --> 58:33.969
-Bye-bye!
-Mommy!

58:35.429 --> 58:39.349
Mommy! Guess what we did!

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:29.668
Unbelievable! Just looking at you
makes my blood boil!

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:32.254
-Because I remind you of yourself?
-Mommy!

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:35.257
-Mommy...
-Mom?

1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:39.386
In the end, I wasn't able
to become Shinji's mother.

1:00:40.804 --> 1:00:42.889
Come on, let's do it.

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:47.727
Again? Weren't you going
to meet a friend on campus?

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:52.732
Oh, Ritsuko?
Don't worry, there's still time.

1:00:52.816 --> 1:00:56.153
We've been lying around
in bed for a whole week now.

1:00:56.236 --> 1:01:01.491
I think I've got the hang of it.
So come on, okay?

1:01:05.537 --> 1:01:11.126
I think we do this to prove to ourselves

1:01:11.209 --> 1:01:12.919
that we really exist.

1:01:13.003 --> 1:01:18.341
How idiotic! This is just two lonely
adults consoling each other!

1:01:18.425 --> 1:01:20.927
You're needed, if only for your bodies.

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:24.222
It makes me happy to feel desired.

1:01:24.306 --> 1:01:28.518
That's an easy way to give yourself
a sense of self-worth.

1:01:29.853 --> 1:01:33.190
The person doing this...
This is Ms. Misato?

1:01:33.273 --> 1:01:36.359
Yes, this is another side of me.

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:41.740
Our melded hearts are showing you this
side of me that you never knew existed.

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:47.370
Truth tends to go hand in hand with pain,
so we have to learn to endure it.

1:01:48.663 --> 1:01:52.709
I wonder if I'll do stuff
like Misato does when I grow up?

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:56.129
Hey, you want to kiss?

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:58.340
-No.
-Or are you afraid?

1:01:58.924 --> 1:02:00.550
That's not for kids.

1:02:01.134 --> 1:02:02.510
Okay, here goes.

1:02:04.304 --> 1:02:08.016
You know nothing about me!
Stop bothering me!

1:02:08.725 --> 1:02:11.770
-I <i>do</i> know.
-You do not, you idiot!

1:02:12.270 --> 1:02:15.065
You think you know
the first thing about me?!

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:17.359
You think you can save me?

1:02:18.652 --> 1:02:22.906
That's total arrogance!
You could never know me!

1:02:24.616 --> 1:02:27.869
How could I know you?
You never talk to me, Asuka.

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:31.998
You never tell me anything
or talk to me, so how could I?!

1:02:32.624 --> 1:02:36.253
-Did you try to understand?
-I tried.

1:02:36.336 --> 1:02:41.424
Idiot, I know all about it.
I know you've been jerking off to me.

1:02:41.508 --> 1:02:45.929
Go on, do it like you always do.
I'll watch.

1:02:46.805 --> 1:02:52.018
If I can't have all of you,
I don't want any of you.

1:02:52.727 --> 1:02:54.521
Then be nice to me.

1:02:55.188 --> 1:02:56.856
<i>I am nice to you!</i>

1:02:56.940 --> 1:03:02.654
Liar, you're smiling to distract me!
You just want to keep things vague!

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:05.115
Because telling the truth
always hurts others.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:08.034
And that's a very painful thing.

1:03:08.118 --> 1:03:11.246
When something's left vague,
it drives me crazy.

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:14.416
-You're just desperate.
-I'm scared of things being like this.

1:03:14.499 --> 1:03:16.918
People might decide
they don't need me again.

1:03:17.002 --> 1:03:21.006
It's gnawing away at me!
I'm always worrying! Say something!

1:03:21.089 --> 1:03:24.134
Talk to me! Pay attention to me!

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:39.774
I want to do anything I can for you.
I want us to be together forever!

1:03:40.442 --> 1:03:44.154
Then don't do anything. Stop bothering me.

1:03:44.904 --> 1:03:47.657
All you do is hurt me.

1:03:47.741 --> 1:03:49.409
Asuka, help me!

1:03:49.993 --> 1:03:52.454
Please, you're the only one for me, Asuka!

1:03:53.747 --> 1:03:54.664
Liar.

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:59.210
Anyone would do.

1:03:59.294 --> 1:04:02.881
You're scared of Misato and the First!
Of your father and your mother!

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:05.216
-You're just running to me!
-Help, Asuka!

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.677
That's the easiest, least painful option!

1:04:07.761 --> 1:04:09.387
Come on, help me!

1:04:09.471 --> 1:04:11.389
You've never really loved anybody!

1:04:14.017 --> 1:04:15.935
You're the only one here!

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:19.064
And you've never once loved yourself!

1:04:24.778 --> 1:04:25.612
Pathetic.

1:04:30.158 --> 1:04:31.368
Help...

1:04:33.578 --> 1:04:38.750
Please, someone, anyone, help me.

1:04:41.169 --> 1:04:42.003
Help me...

1:04:44.130 --> 1:04:45.131
Help me...

1:04:46.257 --> 1:04:47.759
Help me!

1:04:49.052 --> 1:04:51.805
Don't leave me alone! Don't abandon me!

1:04:52.472 --> 1:04:54.224
Don't kill me!

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:02.107
No.

1:05:39.561 --> 1:05:43.064
-No one understands me.
-You understand nothing.

1:05:43.148 --> 1:05:46.734
I thought the world was
rock solid and free of pain.

1:05:47.068 --> 1:05:50.530
You mistakenly assumed that
everyone was just like you.

1:05:50.613 --> 1:05:53.825
You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings!

1:05:54.159 --> 1:05:58.288
You were mistaken all along.
You saw what you wanted to see.

1:05:58.371 --> 1:06:01.833
No one wants me. So everyone should die.

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:03.960
Why do you have hands, then?

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:07.380
It makes no difference
to anyone if I'm here or not.

1:06:07.547 --> 1:06:10.258
Nothing would change.
So everyone should die.

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:13.511
Why do you have a heart, then?

1:06:13.595 --> 1:06:17.140
In fact, the world would be better off
without me. So I should die, too.

1:06:17.724 --> 1:06:19.392
Why are you here, then?

1:06:20.894 --> 1:06:22.395
Is it okay for me to be here?

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.690
(NO RESPONSE)

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:33.448
Pilot signal is effectively zero!

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:38.328
Eva series and Geo-front have crossed
the E Layer and are still climbing!

1:06:42.624 --> 1:06:46.961
<i>Current altitude, 220,000 kilometers.</i>
<i>Entering F Layer.</i>

1:06:47.045 --> 1:06:48.254
All Eva units still operational!

1:06:48.338 --> 1:06:53.218
Lilith's Anti-A.T. Field is expanding!
Beginning to materialize!

1:07:16.533 --> 1:07:18.952
Anti-A.T. Field has hit critical!

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:22.872
At this rate, individual lifeforms
won't be able to hold their shape!

1:07:30.547 --> 1:07:31.881
The Chamber of Guf is opening.

1:07:32.715 --> 1:07:35.677
Are the gates of the beginning
and ending...

1:07:36.636 --> 1:07:38.596
of the world finally opening?

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:47.814
<i>The world is filling with sadness.</i>

1:07:48.648 --> 1:07:51.234
<i>Hopelessness is swallowing everyone.</i>

1:07:52.193 --> 1:07:54.862
<i>It's weighing down the hearts</i>
<i>of lonely people.</i>

1:08:07.542 --> 1:08:10.712
Ikari, were you also reunited with Yui?

1:08:14.132 --> 1:08:18.052
Our A.T. Fields...
They're all vanishing...

1:08:18.761 --> 1:08:22.056
This the answer I've been searching for?

1:08:26.185 --> 1:08:27.353
Senpai?

1:08:28.396 --> 1:08:29.397
Maya...

1:08:30.857 --> 1:08:34.527
Senpai!

1:08:37.071 --> 1:08:40.199
The beginning and the end
are found in the same place.

1:08:40.658 --> 1:08:43.911
It is good. All is good.

1:08:51.044 --> 1:08:54.839
I've been waiting for this day
with bated breath.

1:08:55.465 --> 1:08:58.092
We meet again at last, Yui.

1:08:59.177 --> 1:09:03.097
If I were with Shinji,
I would only hurt him.

1:09:04.182 --> 1:09:06.726
Leaving him alone
was the best thing to do.

1:09:07.644 --> 1:09:09.103
You were afraid for Shinji.

1:09:10.021 --> 1:09:12.857
I don't believe that
I can be loved by others.

1:09:13.941 --> 1:09:15.860
I don't deserve it.

1:09:16.736 --> 1:09:18.488
You're just running away.

1:09:19.238 --> 1:09:23.034
You reject the world
before it can hurt you.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:27.747
There is an invisible,
formless thing that exists between people.

1:09:27.830 --> 1:09:31.751
You were so terrified of it
that you walled off your heart.

1:09:32.752 --> 1:09:34.754
And this is my punishment?

1:09:35.463 --> 1:09:38.007
Forgive me, Shinji.

1:11:18.441 --> 1:11:20.026
Rei Ayanami?

1:11:24.739 --> 1:11:28.451
<i>-I hate you.</i>
<i>-Who'd want to be with you?</i>

1:11:28.534 --> 1:11:32.413
<i>-I could never fall for you!</i>
<i>-You're not a part of my life!</i>

1:11:32.497 --> 1:11:36.250
<i>-Go away already!</i>
<i>-Please stop calling me!</i>

1:11:36.417 --> 1:11:39.212
<i>-You don't know when to quit!</i>
<i>-Stop following me around.</i>

1:11:39.295 --> 1:11:42.089
<i>You're the type of person I hate the most.</i>

1:11:42.173 --> 1:11:44.550
<i>I could never love you.</i>

1:11:54.894 --> 1:11:58.940
<i>-I can't stand you!</i>
<i>-Stay away from me!</i>

1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:06.239
<i>Things would have worked out</i>
<i>if it wasn't for you.</i>

1:12:23.297 --> 1:12:24.173
<i>Grow a spine.</i>

1:12:27.593 --> 1:12:31.180
<i>If it's that hard for you,</i>
<i>you can give up.</i>

1:12:32.265 --> 1:12:35.852
<i>If you hate it that much,</i>
<i>you can run away.</i>

1:12:37.061 --> 1:12:41.232
<i>You want relief, don't you?</i>
<i>You want peace, don't you?</i>

1:12:41.732 --> 1:12:44.527
<i>You want to be one with me, don't you?</i>

1:12:44.610 --> 1:12:48.072
<i>You want us to be one,</i>
<i>body and soul, don't you?</i>

1:12:48.656 --> 1:12:53.244
<i>But not with you. I'd rather die!</i>

1:13:58.267 --> 1:13:59.936
<i>-So, um...</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

1:14:03.022 --> 1:14:05.191
<i>What do you suppose dreams are?</i>

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:06.943
<i>Dreams?</i>

1:14:08.194 --> 1:14:10.446
<i>Yes, dreams.</i>

1:14:34.178 --> 1:14:36.722
"DOES IT FEEL GOOD?"

1:14:37.890 --> 1:14:38.891
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:14:40.226 --> 1:14:42.395
<i>I don't understand reality all that well.</i>

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:49.402
<i>You can't tell where the gap is between</i>
<i>your truth and another's reality.</i>

1:14:50.152 --> 1:14:53.155
<i>I don't know where I can find happiness.</i>

1:14:54.407 --> 1:14:57.159
<i>You can only find happiness</i>
<i>inside your dreams.</i>

1:14:58.661 --> 1:15:02.581
<i>That's why this isn't reality.</i>
<i>It's a world devoid of people.</i>

1:15:02.957 --> 1:15:04.417
<i>Yes, a dream.</i>

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:07.294
<i>That's why I'm not here.</i>

1:15:07.795 --> 1:15:11.924
<i>You used a tailor-made fantasy</i>
<i>to get revenge against reality.</i>

1:15:12.633 --> 1:15:13.843
<i>Was that wrong?</i>

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:17.388
<i>You were avoiding the truth</i>
<i>by escaping into a fictional world.</i>

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:20.307
<i>What's wrong with having</i>
<i>a private dream world?</i>

1:15:20.558 --> 1:15:24.645
<i>That's not a dream.</i>
<i>That's just a substitute for reality.</i>

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:45.541
<i>Then where are my dreams?</i>

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.461
<i>Beyond where reality lies.</i>

1:15:49.587 --> 1:15:51.756
<i>Then where is my reality?</i>

1:15:53.049 --> 1:15:55.342
<i>Where dreams end.</i>

1:16:21.368 --> 1:16:22.620
Ayanami...

1:16:24.163 --> 1:16:27.708
-Where am I?
-This is an ocean of LCL.

1:16:28.501 --> 1:16:30.669
The ocean that is the origin of life.

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:35.674
A world without A.T. Fields,
where the self has lost its shape.

1:16:36.383 --> 1:16:39.762
A world where you don't know
where you end and others begin.

1:16:40.679 --> 1:16:41.931
An ambiguous world.

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:47.520
A delicate world where you
are everywhere and nowhere.

1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:50.689
Am I dead?

1:16:51.524 --> 1:16:54.401
No, everybody has been merged into one.

1:16:56.278 --> 1:16:59.448
This is exactly the world you wished for.

1:17:07.206 --> 1:17:10.501
No, this isn't right.
I don't think this is what I want.

1:17:11.585 --> 1:17:13.921
If you wish for the existence of others,

1:17:14.130 --> 1:17:17.049
psychological walls
will divide everyone again.

1:17:17.967 --> 1:17:20.594
The fear of the other will begin again.

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:23.305
It's okay.

1:17:31.772 --> 1:17:32.773
Thank you.

1:17:38.237 --> 1:17:41.532
I feel like only bad things
happened back there.

1:17:42.741 --> 1:17:45.703
That's probably why
I was so willing to run away.

1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:49.540
But running didn't help anything.

1:17:49.915 --> 1:17:53.085
Because it meant that I
wasn't there anymore.

1:17:54.128 --> 1:17:56.422
That's the same as no one being there.

1:17:57.798 --> 1:18:02.052
Are you fine with A.T. Fields
hurting yourself and others again?

1:18:03.345 --> 1:18:07.933
I don't mind.
But who are you two inside my heart?

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:10.102
We're hope.

1:18:10.936 --> 1:18:14.982
The hope that people might
understand one another.

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:17.568
And say the words, "I love you."

1:18:18.027 --> 1:18:22.448
But that's just a facade.
A self-serving assumption.

1:18:23.490 --> 1:18:27.411
Something like a prayer.
It could never last forever.

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:30.164
I'm always betrayed eventually.

1:18:31.582 --> 1:18:33.209
They abandon me.

1:18:34.168 --> 1:18:37.254
But I wanted to see them one more time.

1:18:37.338 --> 1:18:41.133
And I think what I felt then was genuine.

1:19:46.407 --> 1:19:50.995
Reality is found in places unknown.
Dreams are found within reality.

1:19:51.203 --> 1:19:54.164
And the truth lies within our hearts.

1:19:55.416 --> 1:19:59.712
Because the human heart
creates the form it inhabits.

1:20:01.005 --> 1:20:06.927
And new visions will change
the hearts and shape of mankind.

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:10.764
Visions, the power to imagine,

1:20:11.056 --> 1:20:15.894
is what creates their own future
and the passage of time.

1:20:17.187 --> 1:20:22.484
But nothing will change
unless people act on their own initiative.

1:20:22.985 --> 1:20:27.531
That's why you have to reclaim
your lost selves on your own.

1:20:27.865 --> 1:20:30.409
Even if you lose your own words,

1:20:30.993 --> 1:20:33.287
even if you are drawn in
by the words of others...

1:20:56.518 --> 1:20:59.897
If they can visualize themselves
in their own minds...

1:21:00.606 --> 1:21:03.150
anyone can return to human form.

1:21:09.698 --> 1:21:15.537
Don't worry. There's a drive
in all life to try to restore itself.

1:21:16.497 --> 1:21:18.499
A heart that strives to live on.

1:21:19.958 --> 1:21:23.879
As long as you have the will to live,
anywhere can be paradise.

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:27.216
After all, we're alive.

1:21:30.803 --> 1:21:34.223
Opportunities for happiness
are everywhere.

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:48.737
As long as there is the Sun,
the Moon, and the Earth...

1:21:50.948 --> 1:21:52.491
it will all work out.

1:22:17.599 --> 1:22:18.767
You'll be okay?

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:25.482
I still have no idea
where happiness can be found.

1:22:26.567 --> 1:22:28.694
But I'll stay here...

1:22:29.903 --> 1:22:33.824
and keep thinking about my life.

1:22:35.451 --> 1:22:39.204
I know that will just lead me to the same
obvious conclusions over and over.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:42.040
Just so that I can stay being who I am.

1:22:45.919 --> 1:22:47.546
But what about you, Mother?

1:22:49.006 --> 1:22:50.632
What will become of you?

1:22:55.387 --> 1:22:58.682
For man to build an Eva in God's image.

1:22:59.349 --> 1:23:01.393
Is that your real goal?

1:23:01.894 --> 1:23:05.439
Yes. Humanity can only live
on this planet.

1:23:06.023 --> 1:23:08.984
But an Eva can live on forever.

1:23:09.568 --> 1:23:12.446
Along with the soul of whoever
is implanted inside it.

1:23:13.322 --> 1:23:15.240
<i>Even after five billion years,</i>

1:23:15.616 --> 1:23:20.787
<i>even after the Earth, Sun and Moon</i>
<i>are gone, it will still be here.</i>

1:23:21.788 --> 1:23:23.749
<i>Even if that person were the only one...</i>

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:28.420
<i>It would be very lonely,</i>
<i>but if that person survived...</i>

1:23:28.962 --> 1:23:32.716
<i>Proof that humanity had once lived</i>
<i>will remain forever.</i>

1:23:34.843 --> 1:23:37.054
<i>Goodbye, Mother.</i>

1:26:42.489 --> 1:26:44.199
Disgusting...

1:26:44.282 --> 1:26:48.161
THE END
