WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.091
Mrs. Hawkins? I worked with your husband.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.093
[woman] He was working
on the metro bombing case.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.430
He thought someone interfered
with the FBI's investigation.

00:13.430 --> 00:17.559
He found something that pointed to
a contractor called Turn Lake Industries.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.021
The day Jamie went missing,
he had a meeting with the CEO.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.314
Holy shit.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.899
[tense music playing]

00:24.899 --> 00:27.986
I was hoping to get more info about
your detail the day of the metro bombing.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.321
- Not without an official request.
- Was it Maddie Redfield?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.906
What's he doing out in the field

00:31.906 --> 00:33.992
with the key witness
to an FBI investigation?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.745
He claims he's investigating
a threat on Maddie Redfield's life.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.205
- Get them back here before it's too late.
- Understood.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.332
- We think there's gonna be another attack.
- Jesus.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.127
Campaign donations. If you wanna know
who bad people are in bed with,

00:44.127 --> 00:45.170
you follow the money.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.380
Vice President Redfield.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.632
- [woman] We should've kept that baby.
- You want the baby?

00:49.632 --> 00:52.260
Maybe we could find another baby to take.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.386
[man] It's them.

00:56.556 --> 01:00.185
This is a mistake. If someone finds out,
you'll be in the middle of a scandal.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.519
No one can find out about this.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.772
I can ditch the agents.
I've done it before.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.398
Maddie, everything okay?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.610
No, you fucking didn't.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.070
Badger's missing. All hands.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.279
[Maddie] Oh my God!

01:11.279 --> 01:13.740
What are you doing? I told you
I'd call you when we were done.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.742
- I need something else.
- [man] Wait, why?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.953
[Maddie screaming]

01:18.953 --> 01:19.954
[music fades]

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
[ominous music playing]

02:03.248 --> 02:05.250
[seagulls warbling]

02:06.042 --> 02:07.877
That was anti-fucking-climactic.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.173
Isn't it better to see him die,
so that we know that he's dead?

02:12.173 --> 02:14.467
You wanted something messier
for your first time?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.678
I don't know, I just expected more.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.555
Okay,

02:19.556 --> 02:21.349
tell me how would you have done it.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.892
Depends. What'd he do?

02:22.892 --> 02:24.561
It doesn't matter what they did.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.938
We don't judge. We execute.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.528
There would be something
to touch, to feel.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.571
Blood.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.742
Blood is messy.
It, uh, takes time to clean up.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.452
Yeah, but at least we'd be sure.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.453
Oh, I'm sure.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.415
I'm sure.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.425
It just would have meant more.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.595
[man] Are you all right?

02:59.387 --> 03:00.680
Was this too much?

03:01.931 --> 03:03.558
Maybe I shouldn't have brought--

03:05.894 --> 03:07.896
[dramatic music playing]

03:14.235 --> 03:15.403
Teach me more.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.656
Teach me everything.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.326
[object clattering]

03:26.456 --> 03:28.082
You should throw that over.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.961
It's evidence. It belongs to him.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.339
Belongs to us.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.715
[man scoffing]

03:37.467 --> 03:40.887
All of him belongs to us now.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.370
[opening theme music playing]

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
[car engine revving]

04:14.170 --> 04:15.588
Why do I have to go so slow?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.383
Because this is the speed limit.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.301
Yeah, but they're getting ahead of us.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.095
No, we have them.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.930
Two miles to the White House,

04:23.930 --> 04:26.975
and our job right now
is to make sure they stay on that path.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.477
So now we've become
fucking chaperones. Great.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.604
Until the orders change, yes.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.942
Worst car chase ever.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.860
[sinister music playing]

04:37.860 --> 04:40.154
Don't lead with the bomber
or the vice president.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.990
We should start
with what we know for sure,

04:41.990 --> 04:44.742
which is the ring, Turn Lake, Wick.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.787
See how Travers reacts
before sharing the Redfield stuff.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.457
It was a right back there.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.917
I'm not taking you in.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.294
To the White House? Why not?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.713
So let's just assume
the VP is behind all this.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.173
He's not authorized
to have pulled your Secret Service detail

04:59.173 --> 05:00.216
at the hotel that day.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.303
So it means someone else
in the White House is working with him.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.805
If we both go in
with the hard drive, then, uh...

05:05.805 --> 05:07.598
- It's a single point of failure.
- Exactly.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.851
So I'll tell the president what we found.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.145
Once she's been briefed,
she can help me with protection.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.146
I'll come get you.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.150
You don't have to worry.
I'm taking you someplace safe.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.109
You'll be fine.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.485
I'm not worried about me.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.363
[dramatic music playing]

05:26.951 --> 05:28.161
Is someone following us?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.079
We're about to find out.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.040
[car engine revving]

05:35.543 --> 05:36.878
Turn right on that light.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.048
Do it. Turn on your blinker.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.924
[blinker clicking]

05:47.513 --> 05:48.973
- Happy?
- [man] No.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.726
He'll be looking for this car.
We need a new ride.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.685
False alarm?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.145
Probably.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
Eli, you're on traffic cams.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.817
Jeff, start canvassing neighbors, friends.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.569
Anything relevant, you report to me.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.487
[indistinct chatter]

06:02.487 --> 06:03.571
Monitor the FBI.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.448
This place is on lockdown
till Almora arrives.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.325
No one in who doesn't need to be.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.118
[camera shutter clicking]

06:09.118 --> 06:10.995
[indistinct police radio chatter]

06:10.995 --> 06:12.163
Anything?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.916
No weapon,
no sign of forced entry besides ours.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.461
FBI will process any DNA,
maybe they might find a match.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.464
But Maddie... Maddie doesn't have time

06:21.464 --> 06:23.633
for the lab nerds
to break out the test tubes.

06:25.051 --> 06:25.968
You're with me.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.845
[suspenseful music playing]

06:28.346 --> 06:29.847
[crickets chirping]

06:34.519 --> 06:37.063
[Redfield sighing]
It's late. What's wrong?

06:37.063 --> 06:40.233
I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President,
but it's about Maddie.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.568
[Redfield sighing heavily]

06:43.069 --> 06:44.445
What's she done this time?

06:44.946 --> 06:46.572
We believe she's been kidnapped.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.200
What?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.078
[Ben] She ditched her security detail
at a school event,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.163
and we're working
under the theory that she--

06:54.163 --> 06:57.917
Well, that she planned
a romantic rendezvous.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.797
It just sounds like she ran off.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.925
And she's done that before.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.387
I'm gonna talk to her, again.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.140
[Ben] Mr. Vice President,
we found her dress and her panic button

07:12.140 --> 07:14.100
inside of her art professor's house,

07:14.892 --> 07:16.310
right next to his dead body.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.771
[doorbell ringing]

07:18.771 --> 07:19.814
[Cisco whistling]

07:26.112 --> 07:28.197
You are definitely not my date.

07:28.197 --> 07:31.451
Yeah, I hate to disappoint,
but I need you to cancel, man.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.410
Do me a solid.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.745
This doesn't make up
for helping me move a couch.

07:34.745 --> 07:35.746
I know.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.583
Come on, man,
I got that girl coming by after her shift.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.084
I made this Ina Garten casserole.

07:40.084 --> 07:42.837
It smells incredible,
but you remember Rose, right?

07:42.837 --> 07:43.963
- [sighing]
- [Rose] Hey.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.924
I need you to, uh, keep her
company for a few hours.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.761
Cisco, please.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.389
Red or white?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.183
Uh, just water, thank you.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.142
Okay.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.019
Man, seriously,
you're, uh, you're a legend.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.645
[Cisco] Yeah. [sighing]

08:01.230 --> 08:03.399
- You still got your car?
- Nah, it's in the shop.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.486
I'll leave you our ride in the garage then
in case you need to get out of here.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
Spot 18.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.949
Hey, Lisa. Bad news.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.744
Yeah, the craziest thing just happened.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.914
You can trust Cisco, okay?
Just don't tell him anything.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.582
It'll be safer for you and for him.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.043
If something does happen,
he'll take you to our meet-up spot.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.754
- You remember where it is?
- The... the fishing pier.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.713
I'll be fine.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.965
I highlighted the most important parts.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.760
Might help Farr and the president
to see it in writing.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.094
Great.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.514
Be careful.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.141
Yeah.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.399
Luckily for you guys,
she gave me a second chance next week.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.401
Good to hear it, man.
I should get out of here.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.491
Just...

08:54.575 --> 08:55.826
take care of her, please.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.078
Yeah, you got it.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.622
- You good?
- [Peter] Yeah.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.623
Thank you.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.291
[Cisco] Yeah.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.591
You ever speak to this professor?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.801
A few times, sure.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.595
I didn't see it though,
how she felt about him.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.847
- Well, maybe it's just about sex.
- No.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.893
She was so nervous
picking out that dress, almost fragile.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.936
- [Erik] Don't.
- I--

09:21.936 --> 09:25.106
Don't play woulda, coulda, shoulda.
That's a losing game.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.484
- This look like Maddie to you?
- [Chelsea] Yes.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.320
He was planning this whole time.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.947
Grooming her, and I didn't--

09:32.947 --> 09:35.366
No, she fucked you.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.368
She ran off

09:37.952 --> 09:40.079
without caring what that would do to you.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.706
It's not about me.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.041
If she had half the respect for you
that you seem to have--

09:44.041 --> 09:46.294
I'm not having this conversation.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.213
You don't have to bottle shit up
to be good at this job.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.799
It is better shared with your partner.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.925
Trust me.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.344
I learned that the hard way.

09:57.138 --> 09:57.972
That's...

09:58.973 --> 10:00.933
another story for another time.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.731
Thanks, but I don't need a pep talk.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.232
I just need to find her.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.156
This guy... he's everywhere.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.826
I just saw that face.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.954
[camera shutter clicking]

10:21.954 --> 10:22.955
Yeah.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.916
- [tense music playing]
- [Erik] Here.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.044
He's looking away in the other drawings.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.503
Like he doesn't wanna be seen.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.422
I doubt he sat for any of them.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.007
Romantic or obsessive?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.050
Fine line.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.551
I learned that the hard way.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.262
Another time.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.433
I've seen this pattern before.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.644
In Maddie's room.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.438
[man] <i>Cullen to Arrington. Almora's here.</i>

10:47.438 --> 10:49.106
<i>Wants a debrief, now.</i>

10:53.194 --> 10:54.195
Sir.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.530
You've been relieved tonight.
Go home and get some rest.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.367
- What?
- Monks, this is your investigation now.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.993
- Where we at?
- [Chelsea] This is my team.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.245
- Not anymore.
<i>-</i> It's my duty to protect her.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.581
Maddie went missing on your watch.

11:05.581 --> 11:09.794
There's no body for you to protect.
I understand the two of you are close,

11:09.794 --> 11:13.756
but the last thing we need are hurt
feelings slowing down good judgment.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.676
Now what I do need is your experience.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.135
Go home.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.056
Erik, find me a goddamn starting place.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.849
Sending her home won't help me do that.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.436
In our business,
this is the biggest fuckup possible.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.856
She was in charge. Redfield needs a scalp.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.191
- Then give him mine.
- Erik--

11:32.191 --> 11:34.026
Just listen, please.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.195
She knows Maddie inside out.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.823
She has the kid's schedule down.
She has her habits memorized.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.159
She cares about the girl,
which is everything right now.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.036
So your assessment's changed then?

11:44.036 --> 11:46.122
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:47.832 --> 11:49.917
The situation's changed.

11:49.917 --> 11:50.918
Fine.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.839
Arrington can stay, but you're in charge.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.674
Find me Maddie.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.937
[man] Hey.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.615
[scanner trilling]

12:21.615 --> 12:23.159
[man] All right, we're good.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.661
- Thanks.
- [man] You're welcome.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.747
[indistinct chatter]

12:29.373 --> 12:30.374
- Hey, Peter.
- [Peter] Hey.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.335
- She asked me to walk you upstairs.
- Really? Worried I'll get lost?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.300
- Is something going on?
- [Valerie] The usual.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.886
Farr's tied up right now.
She said to wait in her office.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.269
[grunting] I'm really sorry
about crashing your date night.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.187
Oh, no biggie.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.440
Just took two months
of witty Bumble banter

12:54.440 --> 12:56.901
before she finally agreed
to meet me in person.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.113
Well, maybe this will build anticipation?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.991
Last-minute cancellation on a first meet?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.075
Super catfishy.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.120
- That's probably right.
- [Cisco] Yeah.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.081
You got a friend for me
to double date with you and Peter?

13:12.082 --> 13:13.626
Oh, Peter and I aren't...

13:14.710 --> 13:16.086
- Yeah.
- My bad. I--

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
He's just looking out for me.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.840
He's a good guy.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.759
[Cisco] Uh, the best.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.093
[both chuckling lightly]

13:23.594 --> 13:25.971
You're actually the only friend
that Peter's mentioned,

13:25.971 --> 13:28.974
let alone called for multiple favors.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.393
How far back do you two go?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.772
We were roommates at Quantico.
He didn't tell you?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.440
I haven't known him that long.

13:37.107 --> 13:40.152
Besides you, I've only heard about his dad

13:40.945 --> 13:42.154
and Zoe.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.281
That's it.

13:44.281 --> 13:48.452
That actually qualifies
as major sharing for Peter.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.247
Well, he didn't say that much about her.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.957
[Cisco] There's not much to say.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.793
Things got tough for Peter,
and she didn't stick around.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.294
For better or for worse.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.921
Peter made it sound like

14:00.130 --> 14:02.091
he pulled away after the metro bombing,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.301
made it hard for her to stay.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.344
Yeah, well,

14:05.886 --> 14:09.139
he's not really the kind of guy
that likes to put blame on others.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.141
I know what I saw, though.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.896
Any other intel you need on our boy?

14:19.066 --> 14:22.152
What's the story behind Kevin?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.404
[both laughing]

14:24.572 --> 14:26.866
[Cisco] We won him off
our firearm instructor.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.701
He was, like, this real hard ass

14:28.701 --> 14:32.454
that gave us shit for not being
good enough, like, all the time.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.416
And so we bet him that we could complete

14:35.416 --> 14:38.752
a grad-level virtual scenario
with zero civilian casualties,

14:38.752 --> 14:42.131
and we told him to put up
his good-luck troll doll as collateral.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.299
Who's we?

14:43.299 --> 14:46.510
Peter and I both made it happen,
and so we both claimed him.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.137
Started stealing him from one another,

14:48.137 --> 14:50.472
and it's kind of became
this ongoing prank now.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.392
But whoever's got Kevin
has the bragging rights.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.227
- Sounds kind of juvenile.
- [Cisco] Extremely.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.105
- And who... who named him Kevin?
- [Cisco] Oh, I did.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.773
And if he tells you otherwise,

15:00.566 --> 15:02.860
we'll let him have it
because we know how sensitive he gets.

15:02.860 --> 15:03.944
- Hand him over.
- No.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.487
He's mine now.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.364
Peter taught you well.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.699
[Rose chuckling]

15:10.492 --> 15:11.410
[woman] Do you see her?

15:12.828 --> 15:15.080
I can't see anything through those shades.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.793
[woman] Hmm.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.762
I was...

15:31.096 --> 15:32.932
thinking about what you said.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.685
What did I say?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.730
About the baby.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.733
[woman scoffing]

15:42.733 --> 15:44.026
Forget about it.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.028
It was a dumb idea.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.323
No, not for the job, but... for us.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.452
I don't understand.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.538
Well, this life is...

15:58.248 --> 15:59.249
all violence.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.544
It would be nice
to have something different,

16:02.544 --> 16:05.422
to create a life together.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.426
- We have a life together.
- [man] You know what I mean.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.096
There could be more than only this.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.725
I don't think so.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.607
This was your idea.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.486
To steal a baby, not make a baby.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.029
You're not listening to me.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.865
Of course I'm listening.
That's why I'm talking to you about it.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.661
People like us
shouldn't get to be parents.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.751
When we're gone...

16:45.004 --> 16:47.214
there could be a piece of us left behind.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.340
[woman scoffing]

16:48.340 --> 16:50.342
Yeah, a messed-up piece.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.472
Oh God, you can't even fuck me properly,
and now you wanna impregnate me?

16:55.472 --> 16:56.473
[woman chuckling]

16:58.142 --> 17:00.144
[dramatic music playing]

17:04.648 --> 17:05.649
I'm sorry.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.359
No, no, you're right.

17:07.985 --> 17:08.902
It's, uh...

17:10.779 --> 17:11.739
It's stupid.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.458
[Rose] <i>Is that you two?</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:26.587
Yeah, Quantico. Not my finest moment.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.963
[Rose] You look happy.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.842
Basic Water Survival
was a real bitch. [chuckling]

17:32.676 --> 17:35.846
The FBI recruiter told me that
all I needed to know was how to float,

17:35.846 --> 17:38.348
and so I showed up unprepared.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.309
The other classmates thought
it was hilarious,

17:40.309 --> 17:41.560
but then my rank dropped.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.481
And so Peter then started inviting me out
to his morning swims,

17:45.481 --> 17:46.982
pretending to get his laps in

17:46.982 --> 17:49.401
while low-key teaching
me how to not drown.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.362
That picture was taken
right after I passed.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.283
I dropped out shortly after. You know,
family drama I won't bore you with.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.161
But, uh,
Peter always made sure we stayed tight.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.413
[Cisco chuckling]

18:01.413 --> 18:05.084
I'd ask how you two met
if I thought you'd tell me.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.961
The old-fashioned way.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.755
I called him.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.260
Do you remember what that logo was on?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.639
Uh, a sweatshirt, or, um, um, a sticker?

18:18.639 --> 18:22.726
I don't know. I guess my feelings
for Maddie cloud my memory of that day.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.144
[Erik] Hmm.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.522
It wasn't like that.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.109
I didn't submit to my subordinate's
opinion, so you took it to the boss.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.111
He asked me for my take on your detail.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.655
So you knew you had his ear,
and you took your shot.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.823
I said it wasn't like that.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.701
And by the way,
he didn't sideline you because of me.

18:39.701 --> 18:42.037
Maddie went missing on your watch.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.664
You think I don't know that?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.088
- [drawer opening]
- [objects clattering]

18:52.798 --> 18:53.966
All right, listen.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.971
Just because you'll get blamed for this,
doesn't mean it's your fault.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.475
You cannot always save
a protectee from themselves.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.019
And look,
I don't give a shit who's in charge.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.564
All that matters is finding Maddie.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.401
So there is no boss here, all right?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.361
Just partners.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.864
[Chelsea breathing deeply]

19:17.447 --> 19:18.282
Good.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.997
I've always done for myself, and

19:26.373 --> 19:28.041
expect the worst in others.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.129
My reaction to you wasn't personal.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.130
I get it.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.174
You don't need my help.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.176
I did tonight.

19:39.928 --> 19:43.974
So if she planned some special night out
with this professor, who would she tell?

19:43.974 --> 19:46.810
- [sighing] Me.
- And if she wouldn't even tell you?

19:52.065 --> 19:54.735
- [Erik] What's up there?
- Caught her stashing something here once.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.987
Promised her I'd never look.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.614
[tense music playing]

20:04.578 --> 20:05.579
[Chelsea] Here.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.796
New Leaf. That's where I saw the symbol.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.423
It's their logo.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.343
She told me a boy invited her
to go to a meeting,

20:19.343 --> 20:20.552
but she decided not to go.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.348
"PB." A boy, or her professor?

20:24.348 --> 20:25.891
Professor's initials.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.267
The flyer's for the D.C. chapter,

20:27.267 --> 20:30.187
but the organization lobbies
for environmental justice globally.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.438
Save the whales kind of stuff?

20:31.438 --> 20:34.608
They organized a sit-in
at an oil pipeline worksite last year.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.943
Shut it down for months.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.780
Paulo is a leader of New Leaf D.C.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.201
Stop. Go back.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.790
That man in the background.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.298
And tell him I need updates
every half hour.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.758
- [woman] Yes, ma'am.
- [door closing]

21:02.678 --> 21:04.513
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.514
Where's Rose?

21:05.514 --> 21:06.431
She's safe.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.143
Safe like she's in the bathroom
down the hall,

21:10.143 --> 21:12.104
or like she's somewhere
you're not gonna tell me?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.605
She's with my friend standing by.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.525
Goddamn it, Peter. I thought we were done
playing these games.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.860
If anything happens to our witness,
or that hard drive--

21:18.860 --> 21:20.570
Rose and the drive are fine.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.990
When you hear what I have to tell you,
you'll understand.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.700
What... what is going on here?

21:24.700 --> 21:27.995
It's unrelated, but comparable
in its fucked-up-ness.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.414
Let's do this first.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.373
[drawer rattling]

21:31.373 --> 21:34.293
[Diane] I had Val look into Turn Lake
after we spoke.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.962
Private military company.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.091
Does most of their business overseas,
lobbying both sides of the aisle.

21:41.091 --> 21:44.386
Their CEO is a former Navy SEAL
turned entrepreneur named Gordon Wick.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.929
- Heard of him?
- Yeah.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.265
We think Turn Lake orchestrated
the metro bombing.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.060
You think this Wick guy
is working with Omar Zadar?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.562
No, we think the metro bombing

21:53.562 --> 21:55.814
was a false flag
manufactured by Turn Lake,

21:55.814 --> 21:59.192
and then they just used Zadar and the PIF
as scapegoats when it failed.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.820
- This is all on the hard drive?
- Not exactly, no.

22:02.404 --> 22:06.241
We traced the assassin's signet ring
to an operative connected with Turn Lake.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.327
And then we also found out
that Jamie Hawkins

22:08.327 --> 22:10.787
went and met somebody at Turn Lake
the day he was murdered.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.913
How do you know?

22:11.913 --> 22:12.998
Cynthia Hawkins.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.667
You hounded his widow? Peter!

22:15.667 --> 22:19.296
She kept saying that Hawkins
didn't buy the whole Zadar thing.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.173
He believed there was more to the bombing.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.425
None of this makes sense.
What's the motive?

22:23.425 --> 22:26.219
Why stage a terror attack
and not publicize the reason?

22:26.219 --> 22:27.846
To cover up the real objective.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.973
The data on the Campbell's hard drive

22:29.973 --> 22:32.768
suggests that bomb
was meant to set off a larger explosion,

22:32.768 --> 22:34.686
to take out somebody above ground.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.359
An assassination attempt
disguised as a terror attack?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.402
Exactly. And whoever the target was,

22:42.402 --> 22:45.322
was being protected by Maddie Redfield's
current Secret Service detail.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.407
That's why you were at Georgetown today.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.951
You think they were targeting
Maddie Redfield?

22:49.951 --> 22:51.870
I did, yeah. Then I talked to Arrington.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.122
She said it wasn't Maddie
she was protecting that day.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.874
Is it possible she lied to you?

22:55.874 --> 22:56.792
Why?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.003
What... what don't I know?

23:00.003 --> 23:03.048
Maddie Redfield
went missing tonight, kidnapped.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.132
What?

23:04.132 --> 23:06.551
That's why this place is a fucking zoo.

23:07.594 --> 23:11.098
We're nowhere trying to find her,
and the timing is just--

23:11.598 --> 23:14.768
I mean, could she have been the target
a year ago? Is she Osprey?

23:14.768 --> 23:15.685
Maybe.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.522
- But there's another Redfield connection.
- What do you mean?

23:18.522 --> 23:20.232
Wick wouldn't have known
about Night Action

23:20.232 --> 23:22.109
unless someone
in the White House told him.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.360
Okay.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.488
Who better to give him that information
than an old friend?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.281
[dramatic music playing]

23:33.036 --> 23:34.579
- [Diane] Jesus.
- [Peter] Yeah.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.249
- You realize what you're saying here?
- [Peter] I do.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.543
But I'm less worried about
what these people have done,

23:39.543 --> 23:41.378
and I'm more worried about
what they will do.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.505
- A second attack?
- Yeah.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.464
Fuck.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.010
I need to fill in Travers.
You need to be there too.

23:49.010 --> 23:49.928
Okay.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.557
[sighing] I mean... the vice president?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.642
I have somebody with Rose.

23:55.642 --> 23:59.187
I'll have him bring her and the drive in,
but it needs to be discreet.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.150
We can bring her in
through the FDR tunnel.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.610
- Okay.
- I'll set up a meeting with POTUS ASAP.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.864
Have your trooper friend
drop her at the loading dock.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.991
[tense music playing]

24:15.036 --> 24:16.037
What?

24:16.872 --> 24:17.706
Nothing.

24:18.957 --> 24:19.833
It's, uh...

24:20.333 --> 24:22.127
Sorry, zoned out. It's been a, um,

24:23.211 --> 24:24.212
rough few days.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.672
I'm running on fumes.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.215
It's almost over, Peter.

24:28.675 --> 24:29.968
You've done a great job.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.304
Thank you.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.388
I'm proud of you.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.224
[Diane sighing]

24:36.725 --> 24:38.185

[suspenseful music playing]

24:44.357 --> 24:46.359
[phone line ringing]

24:47.277 --> 24:48.778
- [Rose] <i>Peter?</i>
- Farr's in on it.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.864
What? You're sure?

24:50.864 --> 24:51.865
Everything okay?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.617
Everything she told me is a lie.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.913
She was talking,
she was playing along, and then she...

24:59.372 --> 25:00.207
She--

25:00.707 --> 25:02.792
She knows you're with a trooper right now.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.003
They fucking know.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.172
- Know what?
- About you and Redfield.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.673
About the metro bombing.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.634
- That's a problem.
- [Diane] <i>You think?</i>

25:10.634 --> 25:13.345
That's your special forces-trained
fucking assessment?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.013
What do you wanna do?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.475
I'll have Peter arrested.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.853
Isolate him until we can figure out
the best way to silo him off.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.856
And Rose Larkin...

25:27.484 --> 25:28.818
I'll let my team know.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.695
[Peter] <i>I'm hanging up.
Destroy your SIM card.</i>

25:30.695 --> 25:31.738
<i>Uh, meet me at the pier.</i>

25:31.738 --> 25:33.490
Wait, how will you get there?

25:33.490 --> 25:34.699
I'll figure it out.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.827
Rose, please,
get out of there right now, okay?

25:37.827 --> 25:38.745
[Rose] Okay.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.622
Ready to tell me what's going on?

25:44.668 --> 25:45.669
[cell phone chiming]

25:47.671 --> 25:48.672
It's green light.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.218
[intense music playing]

25:54.177 --> 25:55.303
Shit.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.643
[man] It's all right.
The tracker's still got them.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.480

27:00.076 --> 27:00.994
[Peter] Shit.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.332
Hey, Liam.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.626
Peter, you look like shit.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.627
What is that?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.920
- Above your clearance, pal.
- You serious? Let me see.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.175
- Oh shit.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.969
I... I'm sorry.
It... it was a joke. You need help?

27:17.969 --> 27:19.763
- No, just leave it.
- Okay.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.056
[Liam] Jesus.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.019
[indistinct chatter]

27:26.019 --> 27:28.813
[man] Yes, sir.
I'll get it to you right away.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.401
- Sutherland!
- [man 2] There he is!

27:33.401 --> 27:34.527
Eyes on Sutherland.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.196
[man] Follow him! Come on! Cut him off!

27:49.376 --> 27:51.503
- You two that way. Eddie, on me.
- [man] Yes, sir.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.587
Move, move, move!

28:02.639 --> 28:03.515
Shit.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.027
- [Nathan] Check the storage room.
- Shit.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.913
[music fades]

28:29.457 --> 28:30.542
[flashlight clicking]

28:31.084 --> 28:32.752
[door creaking, closing]

28:38.425 --> 28:39.634
Check the door.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.726
[door closing]

28:58.528 --> 28:59.529
[door opening]

29:00.613 --> 29:02.907
- You think he knows about the tunnels?
- [door closing]

29:07.203 --> 29:09.122
All clear. Entrance is secure.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.708
I'll check the server room.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.835
You run through H Street, just in case.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.194
[Cisco] What do these killers look like?

29:39.194 --> 29:41.696
- Why?
- This one's getting real fucking close.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.240
[car engine revving intensely]

29:45.450 --> 29:46.534
Yeah, that's them.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.076
[keypad beeping]

31:22.255 --> 31:23.506
[Cisco] I think we lost them.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.885
How do they keep finding me?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.262
They're tracking you somehow.
This car maybe?

31:30.638 --> 31:32.432
Okay, well, what do we do?

31:33.808 --> 31:35.685
- I'm gonna drop you off.
- Where?

31:35.685 --> 31:37.604
I'll take the next corner, you jump out.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.772
Run to Foundry Branch Park.
Get to the pier.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.357
It'll be faster on foot.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.526
We do it right,
they won't realize you're not inside.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.694
What about you?

31:44.694 --> 31:46.905
I'll call for backup,
lure them away from you.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.947
Are you sure?

31:48.823 --> 31:49.782
Positive.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.535
[suspenseful music swelling]

32:03.421 --> 32:04.464
Go! Run!

32:07.133 --> 32:08.092
[Rose] Thank you.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.351
Stop.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.561
- What?
- She got out.

33:13.741 --> 33:16.327
This is Maryland State Trooper
Francisco Jenkins.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.997
There are two assailants
trying to kill me and my friend.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.456
I need patrol units on--

35:38.761 --> 35:41.097
- Put your fucking hands on the ground!
- Okay.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.891
He killed my aunt and uncle!
Fucking shoot him!

35:43.891 --> 35:45.685
It's not up to us, Rose. I can't!

35:46.185 --> 35:47.812
[man] Your friend, Lorna,

35:48.729 --> 35:49.856
she showed courage.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.984
- Lorna fought.

But your aunt...

37:29.997 --> 37:32.124

37:32.124 --> 37:34.460
Almora's updating me on Maddie
in two minutes.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.586
So, what is it?

37:35.586 --> 37:37.004
The vice president, ma'am.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.047
Thank you, Val.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.467
It's about your daughter.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.262
Is this you?

37:45.263 --> 37:49.141
- You had something to do with this?
- Keep your fucking voice down.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.770
No, of course not.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.817
But we can use it to our advantage.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.111
You wanna use Maddie's kidnapping?

38:01.153 --> 38:02.196
To do what?

38:02.196 --> 38:04.991
Sutherland and the Larkin girl
are onto you and Wick.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.575
How do you know this?

38:13.082 --> 38:13.916
Fuck.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.253
So, uh, what do they know about Zadar?

38:17.253 --> 38:18.170
They know enough.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.172
And Sutherland is where now?

38:20.172 --> 38:21.257
He escaped.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.425
Jesus Christ.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.802
I can't deal with this, Diane.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.012
My daughter is missing.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.723
Could you just handle this
the way you promised you would?

38:28.723 --> 38:30.850
Let's get one thing fucking straight.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.562
You don't get to spill the milk
and then pawn the cleanup off on me.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.147
That's not how this works.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.773
We need a diversion.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.401
Maddie is not a diversion.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.945
She is my goddamn daughter.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.781
Making this mess disappear
is bigger than your daughter.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.782
That's a fact.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.411
Or maybe you'd rather roll the dice
and see how the nation reacts

38:50.411 --> 38:52.788
when they learn the truth
about everything you did.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.041
- Don't threaten me.
- [Diane] I'm not.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.792
I'm trying to save your ungrateful ass.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.253
If you don't like how I do it,
you should've thought twice

38:59.253 --> 39:02.381
before dragging me into all of it,
after the fact.

39:03.799 --> 39:04.884
[Redfield sighing]

39:05.926 --> 39:09.638
If we can't silence Peter,
maybe we can discredit him.

39:09.638 --> 39:10.973
Maddie can help.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.433
What is the plan?

39:12.433 --> 39:13.684
Go get your update.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.480
And then meet me
in the East Wing Green Room.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.148
What for?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.567
We need to get you camera-ready.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.111
[indistinct chatter]

41:15.139 --> 41:16.849
Did Cisco say where he was going?

41:18.184 --> 41:23.189
He tried to lead them away in the car,
but I don't know.

41:24.523 --> 41:27.067
It's like they knew exactly where we were.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.240
The day I took Farr to meet you
at the... the motel,

41:34.700 --> 41:38.579
she must have put a tracker
or something on our car.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.500
[Rose] Whose boat is this?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.501

41:44.210 --> 41:45.753
[Peter] It's a friend of my dad's.

41:46.253 --> 41:48.631
Should be a lockbox
on the inside of the awning.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.510
This one.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.595

Yeah, it's 1202.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.059
[lock clicking]

42:00.059 --> 42:01.185
That's my birthday.

42:02.394 --> 42:04.188
Sounds like he cared about you.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.814
He was my godfather.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.566
Hold on, hold on.

42:08.067 --> 42:08.901
[Rose] Okay.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.569
[Peter wincing, panting]

42:11.445 --> 42:12.821
Agent Richards showed the sketch

42:12.821 --> 42:14.740
of our suspect
to the professor's neighbor.

42:14.740 --> 42:18.118
Now, she's seen him around for months.
Thought they were a couple.

42:18.118 --> 42:21.664
Nice work. I'll have the FBI run
the sketches through facial recognition.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.083
In the meantime,
I need you to follow up on a new lead.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.668
<i>There's a person of interest.</i>

42:25.668 --> 42:28.087
I'll send the name and the address.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.964
This is priority one, you got it?

42:29.964 --> 42:30.881

42:31.632 --> 42:32.633
[cell phone chiming]

42:32.633 --> 42:33.801
Who's the suspect?

42:35.719 --> 42:36.679
No way.

42:37.763 --> 42:40.474
Read through this before you go in.
It sounds more natural

42:40.474 --> 42:42.351
when you don't stumble
with the teleprompter.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.019
I don't need a script.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.981
[Diane] Wick's people are radio silent.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.900
Sutherland and the girl are somewhere
out there with the hard drive.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.403
Your ability to sell our story

42:52.403 --> 42:55.197
is the difference between the White House
and a super-max cell.
