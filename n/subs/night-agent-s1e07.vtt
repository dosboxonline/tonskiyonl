00:06.047 --> 00:07.424
You realize what you're saying?

00:07.424 --> 00:09.175
I'm less worried
about what they've done,

00:09.175 --> 00:10.802
and more worried about what they'll do.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.345
- A second attack?
- Yeah.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.388
I want this.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.557
What're you doing?
I said I'd call you when we're done.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.559
- I need something else.
- [Paulo] Wait, why?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.477
[Maddie screaming] No!

00:19.477 --> 00:20.770
[man] Shut up.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.231
[ominous music playing]

00:23.231 --> 00:25.900
- Can I help you?
- I wanted to show my husband your house.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
I grew up here.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.570
Wanna take a look inside?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.073
[man] Found it!

00:34.784 --> 00:38.246
Looks like a lot of Turn Lake's money
went to Vice President Redfield.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.081
Wick wouldn't have known
about Night Action

00:40.081 --> 00:41.958
unless someone
in the White House told him.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.586
Sutherland and the Larkin girl
are onto you and Wick.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.630
I can't deal with this, Diane.
My daughter is missing.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.091
Could you just handle this
the way you promised you would?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.384
What do you wanna do?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.844
I'll have Peter arrested,

00:52.844 --> 00:56.014
isolate him until we can figure out
the best way to silo him off.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.265
[Nathan] Eyes on Sutherland!

01:00.060 --> 01:01.686
You are definitely not my date.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.521
I need you to cancel, man. Do me a solid.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.402

01:13.823 --> 01:15.658
[woman wailing]

01:15.658 --> 01:17.535
[Erik] I don't give a shit
who's in charge.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.996
All that matters is finding Maddie.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.415
So there is no boss here.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.919
If we can't silence Peter,
maybe we can discredit him.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.214
My daughter was kidnapped last night.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.758
[anchor] <i>The Secret Service
have identified a person of interest</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.093
<i>in Maddie's disappearance.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:37.347
His name is Peter Sutherland, Jr.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.160
[children giggling]

01:59.160 --> 02:01.121
[Redfield] How're they outraising us?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.122
Okay, listen,

02:02.122 --> 02:06.126
most of our voters barely have broadband,
so I don't care about Internet outreach.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.962
- Dad, I want it.
- [Redfield] I need you to rope me donors.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.673
- [Maddie] Stop.
- Voters don't get people in office.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.717
CEOs do, super PACs do.
So if we can just--

02:14.717 --> 02:16.386
- [girl] No!
- Hold on.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.097
Maddie, give the toy to Sarah.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.348
[Maddie] But it's mine.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.142
Share, or I'll take it away.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.522
Sorry, just wrangling two kids
by myself here.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.900
Sometimes, I'd like to poke myself
in the eye with a hot knife, you know?

02:30.900 --> 02:34.362
No, I'm not gonna say that out loud.
I'm saying it to you.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.282
Sarah?

02:38.074 --> 02:38.908
Sarah?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.162
- No!
- [water splashing]

[Redfield wailing]

02:47.417 --> 02:48.293
[Redfield] Sarah!

[Redfield sobbing]

02:54.048 --> 02:55.049
[Redfield] Maddie!

02:55.884 --> 02:57.051
Maddie!

[somber music playing]

02:59.554 --> 03:01.639
[birds chirping]

03:08.563 --> 03:10.440
Sarah will come back, Daddy.

03:11.941 --> 03:12.817
What do you mean?

03:13.484 --> 03:16.738
Sarah took my doll,
and I wished she'd go away forever.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.617
That's why it happened.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.619
But I can wish her back.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.579
You were supposed to be watching her.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.539
I know. But I can wish her--

03:26.539 --> 03:28.875
That's not how it works, Maddie.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.378
Once you wish someone dead, that's it.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.714
Sarah's gone, understand?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.383
Gone forever.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.094
And you were supposed to be watching her.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.893
Who are you? What's this all about?

04:28.893 --> 04:30.103
- Tell me.
- Get up.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.813
[tense music playing]

04:32.522 --> 04:33.648
[man] Get up.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.279
Hold the paper.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.117
Front page.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.245
Higher.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.664
Whatever you want,
my father can get it for you.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.916
Just let me talk to him, please?

04:53.751 --> 04:54.627
Please?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.214
What do you want from me?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.427
What do you want from me?!

05:04.512 --> 05:06.848
[seagulls warbling]

05:08.683 --> 05:10.685
[wind blowing]

05:35.835 --> 05:37.086
He didn't even hesitate.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.092
I called him one time.

05:44.969 --> 05:45.845
He was there.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.766
I know, but you would've done
the same for him.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.603
We gotta keep going. If we stop,
a lot of people could get hurt.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.272
- A lot of people have gotten hurt.
- None of that was your fault.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.704
Peter, I wouldn't still be here
if you hadn't come through for me.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.498
Cisco, Lorna,

06:14.582 --> 06:18.252
none of them would want us to give up,
especially my aunt and uncle.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.964
Hearing Lorna talk about them...

06:24.050 --> 06:25.176
they sounded, uh...

06:27.428 --> 06:28.596
They were the best.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.433
I'm sorry.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.275
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without them,

06:41.818 --> 06:43.736
but I know that I'm not gonna give up.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.824
Peter, I'm gonna find the truth,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.285
and I'm gonna finish what they started.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.163
Or we could just...

06:56.332 --> 06:59.544
sail someplace else,
forget about all this shit.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.130
Maybe, but that's not who you are.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.259
Do you remember the first time
when I called Night Action?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.679
What you said to me on the phone,
when I was terrified in that closet?

07:10.304 --> 07:12.515
- No.
- You told me to fight like hell.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.477
And that's what
I need you to do right now.

07:17.979 --> 07:18.855
For me.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.910
[tender music playing]

[table clattering]

08:00.354 --> 08:01.689
[Peter wincing]

08:01.689 --> 08:02.690
Oh my God.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.567
- [Peter panting]
- Are you okay?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.527
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.820
[Peter sighing]

08:10.323 --> 08:12.033
[both laughing]

08:12.700 --> 08:13.951
Oh yeah, I'm good.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.006
[man] Well, the FBI should be proud.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.759
They trained Sutherland so well
in countersurveillance, he's vanished.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.136
I'll pay his college buddies a visit,
see what they know.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.055
Dave's calling the ex-fiancÃ©e in Texas.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.556
All right. Keep me updated.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.642
[indistinct chatter]

08:41.729 --> 08:45.149
[Erik] I'm guessing there's no written
confession or some sort of manifesto?

08:45.149 --> 08:47.109
I doubt Sutherland's the type.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.778
But you can check the shelf.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.870
Hmm. Why keep books you never read?

08:57.870 --> 09:01.874
Pretension. Just ask 90% of people
with copies of <i>Infinite Jest</i>.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.584
[tense music playing]

09:06.212 --> 09:07.046
I got it.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.430
"Warmly, Jim."

09:16.430 --> 09:17.974
No return address.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.685
[Erik] Also from Jim.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.646
I guess Sutherland didn't appreciate
Jim's literary taste.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.148
But he cared enough about him
to keep the cards and the books.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.734
Patrick, run these for prints.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.487
We're looking for a sender
with the name Jim or James.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.243
Maybe this Jim guy knows where Sutherland
might disappear to with Maddie.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.954
- This doesn't track for me.
- Which part?

09:39.954 --> 09:43.040
This place, this guy.
I don't think he has Maddie.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.043
Nothing at the art professor's apartment
points to him.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.254
Nothing at the office,
nothing at the dorm.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.257
It doesn't make sense to me either.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.175
What does the White House
know about Sutherland

09:53.175 --> 09:55.595
that they're not telling us
that makes him a suspect?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.512
I'm not sure.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.889
If they're wrong about him,
where does that leave Maddie?

09:58.889 --> 10:01.142
Maybe we should be working this
from more than one angle.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.145
- What do you have in mind?
- Still got that flyer?

10:17.325 --> 10:18.492
[indistinct chatter]

10:18.492 --> 10:21.162
- [Diane] Keep bugging him about that.
- [man] Yes, ma'am.

10:22.872 --> 10:23.706
Valerie.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.043
Call Senator Blaine
and cancel tomorrow's meeting.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.255
Madam President.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.550
- I could've come to the Oval.
- [Michelle] No, it's fine.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.136
Thanks, Val.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.972
[door closing]

10:41.140 --> 10:44.268
- Any news on Maddie?
- [Diane] Not yet. But she has to be alive.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.271
Nobody targets the VP's daughter
unless they want something.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.316
And if they want something,
her well-being is their only leverage.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.818
And if it is Peter Sutherland,
then what the hell does he want?

10:52.818 --> 10:55.196
[Diane] Just guessing,
but he's always had a bug up his ass

10:55.196 --> 10:58.949
about his father, saying he was framed,
"the truth is out there" kind of stuff.

10:58.949 --> 11:02.036
Might be his way
of drawing attention to that.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.954
So, what happened last night?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.707
You brought him in, and then you lost him?

11:06.707 --> 11:09.502
Every federal agency is working
around the clock looking for him.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.630
No, damage control
is not enough here, Diane.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.799
I'm wondering how this could happen.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.261
So, what? He came in,
and you spoke about the Campbell case.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.847
I told him to bring in Rose Larkin,
but he came alone.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.891
He wouldn't tell me where she was.

11:23.891 --> 11:27.103
He wouldn't tell me why he was snooping
around Georgetown looking for Maddie.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.022
He didn't say anything
other than he was done helping us.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.607
He's gone rogue.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.861
For all I know, he's holding
the Larkin girl hostage now too.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.113
You promised me she'd be safe.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.116
If I knew then what I know now,
I obviously wouldn't have brought him in.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.660
[Michelle] So you agree
you demonstrated poor judgment?

11:43.911 --> 11:46.497
Because I'm starting to wonder if I did.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.249
- How dare you?
- Careful.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.293
[Diane] I have had your back
your entire political career, Michelle.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.380
I helped you get the House,
the Senate, the presidency,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.549
and now you're telling me
you don't trust me?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.385
Not you, your judgment on this.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.054
Everything I've done, I've done
for what you believe in. Everything.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.766
Not because we're friends,
or we held each other's hair in college,

12:05.766 --> 12:07.476
but because I believe in you.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.729
Your agenda can do
so much good for this country.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.106
I hope you know
I would never try to sabotage that.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.277
I misjudged Peter, I admit that,
but we'll find him, and we'll save Maddie.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.824
Michelle, I'm on your side.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.248
We have been through a lot together.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.250
It's true.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.794
But I think you've got
too much on your plate right now,

12:33.794 --> 12:38.215
so if you wanna protect the agenda,
focus on the day-to-day...

12:39.383 --> 12:42.595
Moving forward, I think you need
to take a step back from this case.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.222
[dramatic music playing]

12:53.147 --> 12:54.148
[man] Welcome to New Leaf.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.065
[door closing]

12:55.065 --> 12:57.359
Awfully quiet. Staff on vacation?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.070
Well, most of our team
went to the protest on the Hill.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.323
I'm Dylan, by the way. How can I help you?

13:03.115 --> 13:04.492
We're with the Secret Service.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.036
Is this about Maddie Redfield?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.329
You know her?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.080
I know who she is. I know she's missing.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.373
[Erik] What about this man?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.335
Yeah, that's Paulo. Paulo Bonetto.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.004
He's one of our core members.
He teaches at Georgetown.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.215
He talked about
bringing Maddie around here sometime,

13:19.215 --> 13:21.050
but it hasn't happened yet.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.927
He was gonna talk to her
about it last night.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.595
So you knew Paulo was planning

13:24.595 --> 13:26.889
a secret meeting last night
with Maddie Redfield?

13:27.389 --> 13:30.893
You... you don't think Paulo's involved
in her kidnapping, do you?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.520
- He would never--
- Paulo is dead.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.856
- What?
- Shot and killed by whoever took Maddie.

13:35.856 --> 13:39.151
Someone who knew Paulo and Maddie
were secretly getting together.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.487
Paulo's dead?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.072
[Chelsea] Yes.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.032
So where were you last night?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.202
Um... Shit, do... do I need a lawyer?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.955
- Only if you're hiding something.
- No, no, nothing.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.873
I was here last night, all night.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.917
How did you know
Maddie was with him last night?

13:56.293 --> 13:57.920
He... he told me.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.174
Paolo thought that if he recruited her,
that she could amplify New Leaf's message,

14:02.174 --> 14:05.845
and he was gonna try to convince her
to record a plug for us last night.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.889
And then he was gonna send me the video,
but he never responded to me.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.349
Who else was in on this plan?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.726
I mean, it wasn't, like, a plan.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.644
Him?

14:14.979 --> 14:15.813
[Dylan] No.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.107
[Erik] What about him?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.237
[Chelsea] You're not in trouble, Dylan.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.363
Not yet.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.116
Tell us who this is.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.953
- That's Matteo.
- [Erik] Matteo?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.289
- Matteo who?
- [Dylan] I don't know his last name.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.625
Uh, he started dating Paulo,
like, eight or nine months ago,

14:36.625 --> 14:38.460
but I haven't seen him for weeks.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.754
[sinister music playing]

14:42.923 --> 14:44.466
[Elliott] <i>Rome Tome had the facts first.</i>

14:44.466 --> 14:47.136
<i>And if people had actually listened to us
about Peter Sutherland,</i>

14:47.136 --> 14:48.429
<i>about the metro bombing,</i>

14:48.429 --> 14:51.140
<i>then Maddie Redfield
would be home safe right now.</i>

14:51.724 --> 14:55.185
<i>And this is a message that goes out
to all of my loyal Romans out there.</i>

14:55.185 --> 14:59.315
<i>We have a moral responsibility
to find this... this... this shithead</i>

15:00.065 --> 15:01.233
<i>and bring him to justice.</i>

15:01.233 --> 15:03.527
[Rose] Doomscrolling never helped anybody.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.570
[keyboard clacking]

15:04.570 --> 15:05.571
Yeah.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.368
[Peter sighing]

15:11.368 --> 15:14.163
I guess I've always wanted
to be closer to my dad.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.248
I finally got my wish.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.418
What was he accused of exactly?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.588
[seagulls warbling]

15:24.298 --> 15:26.425
Classified documents were leaked, okay,

15:26.425 --> 15:29.720
that compromised
U.S. defense strategies around the world.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.308
Uh, the breach was traced back
to the FBI's counterintelligence division.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.518
My dad was section chief.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.438
And did they find any evidence, or...?

15:42.149 --> 15:44.360
He died before they could charge him.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.655
None of the evidence was made public.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.365
[Rose] Well, if you knew he was innocent,

15:49.365 --> 15:51.659
then why join the FBI?

15:51.659 --> 15:52.576
You must hate them.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.704
My dad,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.667
he always had faith
in the institution, you know?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.378
He taught me to believe in due process,

16:03.379 --> 16:06.006
"innocent till proven guilty," and I just...

16:08.217 --> 16:10.302
thought maybe if I kept that faith--

16:10.302 --> 16:12.388
You could clear his name one day.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.806
Yeah.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.435
- Fucking naive.
- [Rose] I don't think it's naive.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.188
I think it's a fight
you can't win right now,

16:21.772 --> 16:23.649
and maybe there's a fight more important.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.693
Yeah, maybe.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.615
What are we gonna do?
Everybody in the country's looking for me.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.535
Well, we could take the evidence we have
to someone in the press.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.371
No journalist is gonna believe us
without a smoking gun.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.915
Well, let's find it then.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.126
What else do you remember
about the bomber that night?

16:42.126 --> 16:46.005
I told the FBI everything.
They interviewed hundreds of suspects.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.424
Well, can we check their work?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.009
My portal access is revoked.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.181
[Rose] Wait, you grabbed somebody's badge
at the White House.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.891
What about Liam's?

16:59.601 --> 17:02.062
Yeah, I mean,
we'd still need his password though.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.524
Well, luckily, you know someone
with the skills and tools to crack it.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.736
- Okay, you're a black hat now?
- And you're a wanted fugitive.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.612
I guess we make a great team.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.698
[both chuckling]

17:13.198 --> 17:14.867
[tense music playing]

17:14.867 --> 17:17.369
I just received this 20 minutes ago.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.123
<i>What... whatever you want,
my father can get it for you.</i>

17:21.123 --> 17:22.833
<i>Just please let me talk to him, please?</i>

17:23.417 --> 17:24.668
Tell him the demands.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.253
Just one.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.092
"You have two days."

17:32.092 --> 17:35.220
"Confess you planned the metro bombing
and covered it up."

17:38.849 --> 17:40.809
"Admit who your accomplices were."

17:40.809 --> 17:44.021
"If you don't, I'll have Maddie
tell the world what you did,

17:44.021 --> 17:46.648
and then I'll kill her
for everyone to see."

17:47.608 --> 17:50.652
Who the fuck is this?
And why are they giving it just to you?

17:50.652 --> 17:51.612
Unclear,

17:51.612 --> 17:54.073
but I have my guys tracing the email.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.158
- What do we do?
- [Diane] We move forward as planned.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.036
This guy's giving us two days to find her.
It'll be fine.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.914
Fine? This is my family.
This is Maddie's life.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.207
I don't see any cameras here,

18:03.207 --> 18:05.542
so you can dial down
the sympathetic father act.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.543
Oh, fuck you.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.462
This is my daughter.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.881
[Diane] It's a little late
to start caring about her now.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.842
This kidnapper's not just asking
for you to fall on your sword.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.636
He wants all of us hung by our heels.

18:16.136 --> 18:16.970
She's right.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.808
[sighing heavily] Jesus Christ.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.687
Okay.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.359
What if I confess?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
I mean, who would even believe it?

18:32.236 --> 18:37.157
A father of a kidnapped girl would say
anything to get her freed, right?

18:38.325 --> 18:40.035
I mean, that's it, I'll confess.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.287
And then when we get her back,
I'll deny it,

18:42.287 --> 18:44.081
and no one will believe any of it.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.960
Until someone starts digging into
the smoke and finds a fucking forest fire.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
You are not surrendering to these demands.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.005
If the kidnapper tells Maddie
what he knows,

18:52.005 --> 18:53.757
even if we get her back safely, what then?

18:53.757 --> 18:55.717
- I... I can control her.
- Can you?

18:55.717 --> 18:58.262
Yes, as I always have.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.722
What if I told you

19:00.722 --> 19:03.934
Maddie was getting ready
to publicly humiliate you?

19:04.518 --> 19:05.602
What are you talking about?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.692
[car door opening]

19:11.692 --> 19:13.068
[footsteps approaching]

19:15.028 --> 19:17.281
- What the fuck is this?
- Open it.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.371
It's your old nanny cam.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.540
Maddie was making noises to her therapist,

19:26.540 --> 19:29.001
and fortunately,
Dr. Hennings gave me a heads-up

19:29.001 --> 19:31.461
about what Maddie was planning
to show the world.

19:31.962 --> 19:32.963
You should watch it.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.464
I did.

19:35.382 --> 19:38.427
- Your daughter wants to ruin you.
- Why are you doing this?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.679
[Diane] You asked me
to clean up your mess, remember?

19:40.679 --> 19:42.306
Which I did,

19:42.306 --> 19:46.727
reluctantly, resentfully, but effectively,

19:46.727 --> 19:50.564
so you can keep your tired complaints
and woe-is-me defeatism

19:50.564 --> 19:52.900
and accept some basic fucking reality.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.446
You are on the plane with the both of us.
I am not letting you crash us to ground.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.991
You can keep that.
We've made digital copies.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.828
[suspenseful music playing]

20:05.537 --> 20:07.581
I thought we were all
on the same team here.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.875
We are. This just makes it official.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.921
- [car door closing]
- [car engine starting]

20:18.759 --> 20:20.636
Help!

20:21.220 --> 20:22.554
Somebody help me!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.185
[Maddie breathing heavily]

20:29.061 --> 20:30.145
[bed creaking loudly]

20:43.075 --> 20:44.201
[door creaking open]

20:49.081 --> 20:50.707
[Maddie panting]

20:50.707 --> 20:52.167
[keys jangling]

20:52.167 --> 20:54.253
[lock clicking]

20:55.629 --> 20:57.381
[Maddie's breath shuddering]

20:58.840 --> 21:01.343
You can yell all you want,
no one's gonna hear you.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.361
- Why'd you kill him?
- [Matteo] Who, Paulo?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.697
Don't be too concerned.
He didn't like you.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.240
You were just his mark.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.616
Did he plan this with you?

21:24.616 --> 21:27.202
Paulo was using you
for his propaganda campaign,

21:28.620 --> 21:30.580
and I was just using him to get to you.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.208
[Maddie] Whatever this is,
you don't have to go through with it.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.377
It isn't too late to do the right thing.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
I'm not interested in the right thing.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.965
What are you interested in?

21:40.590 --> 21:41.675
Revenge.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.260
For what?

21:46.221 --> 21:47.472
It's my dad, isn't it?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.268
It has to be. What did he do?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.940
- Maybe I can help you.
- You're helping me just by being here.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.901
You don't understand.
I fucking hate my father.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.657
You wanna take him down? I can help you.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.701
[Matteo] Nice try.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.244
I've seen your father's ads.

22:09.244 --> 22:12.497
You're his flag-waving,
apple-pie-eating pride and joy.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.417
You buy that bullshit?
It's a show. It's a performance.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.545
You wanna destroy him?
I have something that can do that.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.548
I have a video that will end him.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.468
We just have to get it.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
There is no "we."

22:28.930 --> 22:33.185
It's in Racine, Wisconsin.
419 North Lake Drive.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.313
It'll be worth it. I promise.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.023
[door slamming]

22:39.066 --> 22:40.567
[footsteps receding]

22:41.234 --> 22:42.694
[Rose] Okay, the week that he died,

22:42.694 --> 22:45.697
Hawkins was looking into
these 12 suspects online.

22:46.239 --> 22:50.452
[Peter] We're looking for somebody
with a military background under 35.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.287
- [keyboard clacking]
- Okay.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.624
- That narrows it down to two.
- [Peter] Pedro Navarro.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.335
Looks like he had a solid alibi
that night. Who's the other guy?

23:00.003 --> 23:02.130
Colin Worley. Died?

23:03.173 --> 23:06.968
He died the day before the FBI
was gonna show up and interview him.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.345
The timing's suspicious?

23:08.887 --> 23:11.681
I mean, there's not even
a cause of death listed.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.891
Look how thin the file is.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.601
No one bothered to look into the guy.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.478
Or someone tampered with his file.

23:19.481 --> 23:23.318
Okay, so if we prove
that Colin Worley's the bomber,

23:23.318 --> 23:25.028
we can connect this thing to Turn Lake.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.071
He might be our guy,

23:26.071 --> 23:29.241
so just hack into the county records
and get the autopsy report.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.451
- Come on, man, hack?
- Yeah, hack it.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.037
What we need won't be digitized.
It's all on paper.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.163
We can dock tomorrow,

23:35.163 --> 23:38.125
and visit the Office of Public Records
like normal people.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.004
Neither his friends
nor his ex-fiancÃ©e knows where he is.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.507
And since Sutherland
is skilled in countersurveillance,

23:45.507 --> 23:47.342
we have few leads to his whereabouts.

23:47.342 --> 23:51.304
But we did learn that the art professor
was trying to recruit Maddie to New Leaf,

23:51.304 --> 23:52.848
and his boyfriend, Matteo--

23:52.848 --> 23:55.892
- The man in the sketches?
- Yes. He may have been part of that plot.

23:55.892 --> 23:59.062
Investigating this Matteo lead
might be our best chance to find Maddie.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.524
Nevertheless, Peter Sutherland
remains the primary suspect.

24:03.984 --> 24:06.653
He showed up at Georgetown
and threatened Maddie's life.

24:06.653 --> 24:10.157
He asked about a past event,
thought Maddie may have been targeted.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.576
Sutherland ran out of the White House
through the tunnel

24:12.576 --> 24:15.120
to avoid answering questions.
An innocent man doesn't do that.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.165
It is possible that he and this Matteo
are working together, ma'am.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.543
There are plenty of other agents
still out there still tracking Sutherland.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.711
Agent Arrington and I

24:22.711 --> 24:25.922
are only suggesting
that we work this from another angle.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.592
[Diane] We're under
a colossal microscope right now.

24:28.592 --> 24:32.012
People in this country
are on edge, scared,

24:32.012 --> 24:34.973
wondering who murdered
the deputy director of the FBI.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.310
If the public sees us
now abandoning the manhunt for Sutherland

24:38.310 --> 24:40.729
to chase after
some sandal-wearing Earth-hugger,

24:40.729 --> 24:43.482
we can kiss this administration
and our agenda goodbye.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.026
- Isn't this a Secret Service matter?
- Stand down, Arrington.

24:47.611 --> 24:48.445
Farr is right.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.240
- Monks, stay on Sutherland.
- Sir, I really think--

24:52.240 --> 24:55.410
Aren't you the one who let Maddie escape
right into the kidnapper's hands?

24:55.410 --> 24:57.245
[tense music playing]

24:57.245 --> 25:00.582
Then I imagine you'd use
all of your energy to find her.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.502
That starts and ends
with Peter Sutherland.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.087
Get going.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.511
[door opening]

25:12.511 --> 25:14.137
[indistinct chatter]

25:15.889 --> 25:19.226
<i>The stories coming out
of today's news reports are shocking.</i>

25:19.226 --> 25:22.938
<i>Evidence of neglect,
of pain medications being withheld.</i>

25:22.938 --> 25:25.232
<i>These are the men and women
we ask to risk everything</i>

25:25.232 --> 25:27.692
<i>in order to protect us
and protect our democracy.</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:29.277
[cell phone vibrating]

25:30.153 --> 25:32.197
- I don't have an update.
- [Diane] <i>I may.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:35.158
Two agents on Maddie's detail
caught the scent of something promising.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.285
I pushed them back on Peter,
but we should pursue it.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.287
- You got a name?
- [Diane] <i>Just a first.</i>

25:39.287 --> 25:40.539
Matteo.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.457
- That mean anything to you?
- No.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.835
[Diane] <i>He's affiliated
with some climate group called New Leaf.</i>

25:45.835 --> 25:48.672
I guess it's somewhere between
Greenpeace and eco-terrorists.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.590
I have a sketch. I'm sending it now.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.218
[cell phone beeping]

25:55.053 --> 25:56.388
[Diane] <i>You recognize him?</i>

25:58.431 --> 26:00.225
Yeah, I recognize him.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.478
[door clattering]

26:09.359 --> 26:11.486
[footsteps approaching]

26:11.486 --> 26:12.612
[keys jangling]

26:12.612 --> 26:14.030
[lock clicking]

26:18.034 --> 26:21.621
The house in Racine belongs to a couple,
Frank and Denise Gimble.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.498
We moved when my dad became governor.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.500
The wife, Denise,
was murdered there last week,

26:25.500 --> 26:29.337
and the only thing the cops found
at the crime scene was a stolen baby,

26:30.463 --> 26:32.507
which I gotta say is weird as fuck.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.260
- A baby?
- [Matteo] She got returned to the mom.

26:35.260 --> 26:39.347
But there was also some damage
in a basement wall,

26:39.347 --> 26:41.725
which makes the cops think
they took something from there.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.354
I hid the video in the basement,
but it was a secret.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.939
No one knew about it except--

26:50.025 --> 26:51.192
Except my therapist.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.530
Why would she--?

26:57.782 --> 26:59.117
What was on the video?

26:59.701 --> 27:01.703
[tense music playing]

27:03.204 --> 27:05.624
- [Redfield] <i>Why aren't you dressed?</i>
- [Maddie] <i>I'm not going.</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:07.250
[Redfield] <i>Stop being selfish.</i>

27:07.250 --> 27:09.669
<i>This event is sponsored
by your sister's foundation.</i>

27:09.669 --> 27:12.005
<i>Your presence is non-negotiable.</i>

27:12.714 --> 27:15.383
<i>I'm not gonna sit there
and listen to you lie anymore.</i>

27:18.178 --> 27:19.054
<i>Excuse me?</i>

27:19.804 --> 27:21.306
<i>You're gonna get up on that stage</i>

27:21.306 --> 27:24.517
<i>and start crying about how Sarah died
because I wasn't watching her.</i>

27:24.517 --> 27:27.562
<i>I'm remembering things
about what happened that day by the pool.</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:30.065
<i>You always told me
that Sarah drowned because of me,</i>

27:30.065 --> 27:33.401
<i>but you left the pool gate open,
you left both of us out there alone.</i>

27:33.401 --> 27:36.988
[Redfield] <i>I'm sorry you have to invent
these stories to protect your conscience,</i>

27:36.988 --> 27:38.198
<i>but I forgive you.</i>

27:38.198 --> 27:40.367
<i>Sarah drowned because of you, Dad.</i>

27:40.367 --> 27:43.453
<i>You keep blaming it all on me,
but you did it. Not me, you.</i>

27:43.453 --> 27:44.954
<i>And I'm gonna tell the whole world.</i>

27:44.954 --> 27:48.458
<i>You ungrateful, lying,
little fucking bitch!</i>

27:49.167 --> 27:50.502
- [Maddie screaming]
- [blow landing]

27:50.502 --> 27:51.711
[Maddie] <i>Get off me!</i>

27:51.711 --> 27:53.338
<i>Get your ass downstairs,</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:56.591
<i>and say your goddamn lines like always.</i>

27:57.384 --> 27:58.968
[Maddie crying]

28:10.188 --> 28:12.524
I wanted to show the world
who he really is.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.858
Why didn't you, then?

28:14.359 --> 28:15.610
[Maddie] Because I believed him.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.070
He would've killed me.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.740
Then he got so in my head,

28:20.740 --> 28:23.618
I started to doubt
if anyone would even listen to me.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.495
[somber music playing]

28:28.289 --> 28:31.918
Whatever you want,
whatever you're planning for my father,

28:31.918 --> 28:33.378
we can do it together.

28:37.465 --> 28:38.425
We'll see.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.264
No, please.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.558
- Please.
- [door slamming]

28:47.100 --> 28:48.727
- [keys jangling]
- [lock clicking]

28:48.727 --> 28:50.812
[footsteps receding]

28:50.812 --> 28:52.230
[door creaking open]

28:53.481 --> 28:55.483
[dramatic music playing]

[water splashing]

29:26.264 --> 29:28.266
[Gordon panting]

29:37.275 --> 29:39.277
[sighing heavily]

29:41.279 --> 29:42.781
[sinister music playing]

29:46.534 --> 29:48.369
You've been ignoring my calls.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.914
I sent your partner the discontinue code.

29:52.332 --> 29:56.628
Things are getting messy,
so the less contact we have the better.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.297
He's dead.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.758
I know.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.013
So the mission is far from discontinued.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.098
Look, I understand your feelings.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.809
Shut the fuck up.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.853
You don't understand anything.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.314
Him and me...

30:18.525 --> 30:20.360
we fit into this world...

30:21.736 --> 30:22.612
together.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.909
And now he's gone.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.539
So you're gonna tell me
where Peter Sutherland is.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.706
I don't know.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.002
- The whole country's looking for him.
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

30:38.002 --> 30:40.129
No, no, not at all.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.757
Okay, look, I'll make you a deal.

30:43.466 --> 30:47.387
I know who Maddie Redfield's kidnapper is.
I'll give you his last known whereabouts.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.764
You find him, take care of him,

30:51.224 --> 30:53.560
and I'll locate Peter Sutherland for you.

30:55.937 --> 30:56.771
Deal?

31:01.734 --> 31:02.944
[man] Here you go, miss.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.742
[suspenseful music playing]

31:09.742 --> 31:11.828
[indistinct chatter]

31:13.454 --> 31:14.497
- [Peter] Hey.
- Hey.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.334
They park their cars
in a garage around the corner.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.587
- We should grab the keys while it's safe.
- Yeah.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.048
Seriously?

31:31.306 --> 31:32.181
Okay.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.558
Stay safe.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.310
Yeah, you too. Don't take too long.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.025
[door opening, closing]

31:54.996 --> 31:55.955
Shit.

31:58.249 --> 32:01.252
[man] All personal items and purses
go in the bins to your right.

32:04.088 --> 32:04.964
Move forward.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.007
[detector beeping]

32:06.007 --> 32:07.050
[wand warbling]

32:07.050 --> 32:08.009
Good to go.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.888
All personal items and purses
go in the bins to your right.

32:18.519 --> 32:19.604
[inaudible]

32:26.903 --> 32:28.696
- [Rose] Hi.
- [woman] Can I help you?

32:28.696 --> 32:33.743
I'd like copies of all public records
related to a Colin Worley.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.411
- Colin Worley?
- Yes.

32:35.912 --> 32:40.750
Okay, you just need to fill out this form,
and I'll need to see your ID.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.755
Oh my God, did you go to Cal?

32:46.422 --> 32:48.091
No, my son's applying.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.719
Not great odds being out of state,
but, uh, trying to manifest for him.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.555
Well, if you give me his name
and his high school,

32:54.555 --> 32:56.432
I could put in a good word.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.435
I'm an alumni,
and I know some people in Admissions.

32:59.435 --> 33:01.270
- Would you really?
- I'd be happy to.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.314
[both chuckling]

33:03.314 --> 33:07.402
Honestly, this school could benefit from
some good out-of-state talent, trust me.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.779
Max is gonna be thrilled.
Did you park in the building?

33:09.779 --> 33:11.489
Can I validate your parking
as a thank you?

33:11.489 --> 33:12.865
Oh no, that's all right.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.952
But there is something
that you can help me with.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.914
<i>This guy called Worley,
he was engaged to my sister.</i>

33:19.914 --> 33:22.041
<i>I always thought
there was something off about him,</i>

33:22.041 --> 33:24.210
but my sister never believed me
until he disappeared.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.462
He just vanished without a trace.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.674
I just need to know what Colin's deal is
and where he might be.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.261
Wow. I can certainly pull the records
as soon as you fill out the form.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.513
Here's the thing,

33:35.513 --> 33:38.850
Colin's associates are kind of dangerous
and very connected.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.227
<i>If they had something to do
with his disappearance,</i>

33:41.227 --> 33:43.187
<i>they'll know that I asked questions.</i>

33:43.187 --> 33:45.732
So is there any way
that I can get his records

33:45.732 --> 33:47.316
without leaving a paper trail?

33:47.316 --> 33:51.070
I'm sorry, but I can't release records
without documentation.

33:51.070 --> 33:53.156
Please, my sister,
I just wanna protect her

33:53.740 --> 33:55.700
and just get her
some answers or something.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.454
I understand it's a sensitive situation,
but I could lose my job.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.082
Oh, well, that... that's the last thing
that I would want.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.501
I'll figure it out.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.212
And, uh, don't worry,

34:08.212 --> 34:10.965
uh, I'll still reach out
to Admissions about Max.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.232
Hey!

34:30.651 --> 34:31.736
Excuse me, ma'am?

34:35.948 --> 34:36.949
You forgot this.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.161
They keep cameras in the office.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.333
I hope you and your sister
find your answers.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.835
Me too. Thank you so much.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.393
Hey.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.188
Hey, didn't I see you in that car
with Peter Sutherland?

35:07.188 --> 35:08.773
Aren't you that missing tech lady?

35:09.398 --> 35:11.317
I-- I think you're mistaken.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.860
[man] Hey, where is he?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.612
Is he coercing you?

35:15.154 --> 35:17.448
- We can protect you from that prick.
- Fuck off.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.450
[man] Hey, we just wanna talk. Come here.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.912
- Are you helping that traitor?
- He's not a traitor.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.040
- Citizen's arrest. Call the cops.
- Get off me.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.668
- This is how patriots get shit done.
- Whoo!

35:28.668 --> 35:29.836
[tires screeching]

35:30.628 --> 35:32.296
Boys, boys, boys, boys, it's him.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.966
- Hey, let her go!
- [man] We're bringing you in too!

35:36.175 --> 35:37.718
- Jesus!
- [Rose] Peter, put that down!

35:39.804 --> 35:41.722
- Come on, Rose. You okay?
- [Rose] Yeah.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.391
[intense music playing]

35:48.521 --> 35:50.189
- [Peter] What were you thinking?
- What?

35:50.189 --> 35:52.275
Arguing with those conspiracy freaks.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.443
- You can't reason with them.
- They were shit-talking.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.695
- Who cares?
- I care.

35:55.695 --> 35:59.073
I can't have you putting yourself
in a dangerous situation like that for me.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.242
- It's not worth it.
- People need to know who you are.

36:01.242 --> 36:04.370
You're the good guy in all of this,
and I'll fight for that.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.083
- We heading back to the boat or...?
- Yeah.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.837
Yeah, but they saw our car,
so we need to hit another valet stand.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.258
[Erik] Jim Wilson?

36:18.676 --> 36:19.677
That would be me.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.263
[Erik] Secret Service.

36:22.763 --> 36:25.099
We have a few questions
about Peter Sutherland.

36:25.099 --> 36:28.060
[sighing] And you think I might know
where he is, Agent Monks?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.856
When you took that bullet
for the last president,

36:32.440 --> 36:34.650
your face bumped my article
off the front page.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.653
I'm a reporter, <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.

36:37.653 --> 36:41.157
Mr. Wilson, we're here because
you sent Peter some birthday cards?

36:41.157 --> 36:42.283
Yes, I did.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.661
He held on to them, huh?

36:48.331 --> 36:49.582
Come on inside. Let's talk.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.796
- [Erik] What's your relation to Peter?
- My godson.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.882
Was my godson.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.550
It's, uh, complicated.

37:00.051 --> 37:00.968
Here, have a seat.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.220
[glasses clanking]

37:04.388 --> 37:05.598
[Jim sighing]

37:05.598 --> 37:08.517
Peter's father was my best friend
for many years.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.478
I never had kids,

37:10.478 --> 37:13.606
so I always considered Peter
to be like my own.

37:14.315 --> 37:18.277
We would take weekends
in the great outdoors.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.155
Got a lot closer when his mom passed.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.325
It's pretty tragic
what that kid's been through.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.619
One loss after another really.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.914
First his mother, then his father,
and then you.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.500
I tried to keep in touch.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.793
What caused the rift?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.295
Difference of opinion.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.258
After Peter's father died,
I started investigating.

37:40.258 --> 37:44.303
I mean, who could have leaked
those classified FBI files?

37:44.303 --> 37:45.471
I spent months on it.

37:46.180 --> 37:50.685
Kept circling the same conclusion.
The most likely culprit was Peter.

37:51.727 --> 37:52.812
Senior, that is.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.563
You thought your best friend
was a traitor?

37:54.563 --> 37:58.734
I didn't wanna believe in the facts,
but I was obligated to report them.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.736
I'm sure Junior didn't take that well.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.613
No. He felt betrayed.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.200
I tried explaining it to him,
but the damage was done.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.370
And when he went off to college,
he just cut ties,

38:10.288 --> 38:12.832
and I haven't seen
or heard from him since.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.586
So to answer your burning question, no.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.632
I don't know where he is.
I don't know where he's been,

38:21.632 --> 38:23.092
and I don't know where he's going.

38:24.010 --> 38:27.722
What I do know is that
you guys are barking up the wrong tree

38:27.722 --> 38:29.307
in this Maddie Redfield case.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.726
- Why is that?
- Peter cares about people.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.270
It doesn't matter
if they're friends or strangers.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.689
He also cares what people think of him.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.317
He doesn't step a toe out of line.

38:39.900 --> 38:44.697
This is not someone who just up
and kidnaps the vice president's daughter.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.700
Well, be that as it may, we still need
to find him and rule him out.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.036
You know of any place he might be?

38:53.748 --> 38:55.833
This was just two hours ago.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.001
[man] <i>Citizen's arrest.</i>

38:57.001 --> 39:00.671
We need to find Peter before he gets hurt
or hurts someone else.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.756
[Peter] <i>Hey, let her go!</i>

39:01.756 --> 39:03.424
[man] <i>We're bringing you in too!</i>

39:03.424 --> 39:05.217
- [man] <i>Jesus!</i>
- [Rose] <i>Peter, put that down!</i>

39:06.010 --> 39:09.055
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know where he is.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.349
You said you all
used to spend weekends outdoors.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.558
- Where?
- [Jim] Everywhere.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.311
Blue Ridge, Catskills, Adirondacks,
you name it.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.439
You keep a camper? I noticed
a trailer hitch on your truck outside.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.775
It's at my old place, down by Shenandoah.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.443
Address?

39:23.235 --> 39:24.070
[pen clicking]

39:25.571 --> 39:27.865
- [Chelsea] Anywhere else he might be?
- [Jim] I have no idea.

39:27.865 --> 39:28.783
[Erik] Is that him?

39:29.909 --> 39:30.743
Yeah.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.662
- Is that your boat?
- [Jim] It is.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.206
I don't use it much anymore.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.666
I doubt that Peter
would remember where I dock it.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.128
And where do you dock it?

39:45.007 --> 39:47.301
The autopsy report
says it's a drug overdose.

39:47.301 --> 39:49.845
Medical examiner
found no indication of foul play.

39:49.845 --> 39:53.432
Colin's rap sheet indicates a couple
of court-appointed stays in rehab,

39:53.432 --> 39:56.143
so an OD is possible.

39:57.019 --> 39:57.853
Shit.

39:59.313 --> 40:02.483
Okay, well, his personal effects
were all forwarded to a next of kin.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.402
There's no name, but there's an address.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.196
The personal effects
include a wallet, keys,

40:07.905 --> 40:11.117
and a keycard to a company
called Allontine Manufacturing.

40:11.909 --> 40:12.952
You look that up.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.498
Allontine Manufacturing.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.085
There's no digital footprint.

40:21.877 --> 40:25.423
Odd, but it shouldn't be a problem.
I just need to know where to look.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.469
Oh my God.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.138
What?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.849
It's a subsidiary of Turn Lake Industries.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.976
[tense music playing]

40:36.976 --> 40:38.185
Shit.

40:39.019 --> 40:40.479
These are his arrest photos.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.024
He's our guy. Colin Worley's the bomber.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.276
Wait, how do you know?

40:45.276 --> 40:48.362
'Cause the guy I chased that night
had that exact same tattoo.

40:48.362 --> 40:51.198
Turn Lake would know
how to murder someone, get away with it,

40:51.198 --> 40:53.409
and make it look like an accident,
an overdose.

40:53.409 --> 40:57.246
So Turn Lake hires Colin Worley,
you stop it, chase him, he escapes--

40:57.246 --> 40:59.540
And then they kill him
to cover their tracks.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.793
We gotta check out this PO box
and figure out who it belongs to.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.880
Maybe his next of kin
knows what Worley was up to.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.840
If we can find out
who he was trying to kill--

41:07.840 --> 41:10.634
We might be able to stop Farr and Redfield
from trying again.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.552
Yeah.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.307
Okay, thanks.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.642
Meet you back at the campus
once we're done here.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.896
Shenandoahan police
checked out the camper.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.857
There's no sign
that anyone's been there for months.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.485
Almora's gonna pull me off this
if we don't turn up something soon.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.195
Don't worry about Almora.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.030
I'm not worried about me.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.282
I'm worried I won't be there
to help Maddie.

41:33.866 --> 41:37.286
I'm worried about where she is right now,
about how she's holding up.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.124
Maddie and I would play out
different emergency scenarios

41:42.124 --> 41:43.792
for if she was ever in trouble.

41:44.335 --> 41:48.005
She thought it was ridiculous,
but she kind of enjoyed it as a game.

41:49.256 --> 41:51.091
I guess I thought it was a game too.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.719
I never really thought anything--

41:54.386 --> 41:56.096
[tense music playing]

41:59.475 --> 42:02.228
[Chelsea] Hands up!
I said hands up! Drop the bag!

42:02.228 --> 42:04.855
- [Erik] Get your fucking hands up!
- [Chelsea] On the ground!

42:04.855 --> 42:06.482
[Erik] On your knees, now!

42:08.025 --> 42:08.943
I've got 'em.

42:13.405 --> 42:14.573
[Rose grunting]

42:16.700 --> 42:17.952
[Peter grunting]

42:17.952 --> 42:18.994
Peter?

42:18.994 --> 42:20.579
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

42:20.579 --> 42:22.665
[handcuffs clattering]

42:24.291 --> 42:25.417
It's gonna be okay.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.211
[music fades]

42:28.337 --> 42:30.005
[ending theme music playing]
