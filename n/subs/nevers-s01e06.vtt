The attack came three years ago.

00:18.792 --> 00:19.959
This was designed

00:20.041 --> 00:23.375
so that we would see the parts,
not the whole.

Or you do go back a ways.
We all do.

It means to destroy us.

came here,

the FreeLife beacon,
lost their shit.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.834
This is why they
hung the bodies there.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.291
-What, they were feeding it?
-Knitter: What? No.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.542
Galanthi don't drink blood
for food.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.875
What's it doing?

13:42.959 --> 13:45.166
Stripe:
Pride, stay calm.
This is fat glass.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.583
Bullets will do nothing
but bounce back.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.125
Whoa.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.917
(rumbling)

13:58.500 --> 14:00.625
-(firing)
-(bullets ricocheting)

14:00.709 --> 14:01.792
(slashing)

14:01.875 --> 14:03.792
-(choking)
-(splashing)

14:06.041 --> 14:07.792
Major:
Oh, I remember now.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.792
The boys that found
this place did get in.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.709
They didn't have the firepower
to kill a Galanthi,

14:13.792 --> 14:15.458
so they improvised.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.291
Lit the beacon and got clean,
in case we sent nukes.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.834
-Just kill this shitto.
-No. We are completely
off mission here.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.417
We were tasked to
save the Galanthi,

14:23.500 --> 14:25.250
and you all shot at it,
and hit one of ours!

14:25.333 --> 14:27.542
-She is not one of ours.
-Don't shrill at a superior.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.417
-We were repelling an advance.
-Knitter: It wasn't an advance.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.041
-It was a fucking handshake.
-Byner: Yeah,
we weren't overly briefed

14:32.125 --> 14:33.834
-on how all this would--
-What about the blood?

14:33.917 --> 14:37.125
-Why would the FreeLife
go to all of that--
-Torture.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.333
(scoffs)
We saw the bodies, genius.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.750
Not the team.
The team was
just the method.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.917
'Cause the Galanthi
bonded with 'em.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.500
Cared for them.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.417
It's basic torture protocol.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.000
You always do the family first.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.041
I would love to know your name.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.750
Second Boot:
How could they get information
from the Galanthi?

14:56.834 --> 15:00.834
Oh, Dainty, torture's
not about information.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.834
Crescent:
It's about hope.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.917
Removing the concept of hope.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.208
But we've done all right.

15:08.291 --> 15:11.291
We're all running hot,
but we found the Galanthi.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.625
And it is still alive.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.208
Well, now, that's
actually your problem.

15:16.291 --> 15:20.208
I called for a full incursion
the moment we met resistance.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.917
Thanks for the intel, big mouth.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.834
So did we. (scoffs)
Wait. Shit...

15:25.917 --> 15:29.125
So, a full engagement
20 feet above our heads?

15:29.208 --> 15:30.875
Nuclear bombs flying everywhere.

15:30.959 --> 15:33.041
We'll never survive that.
Nothing will.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.500
Unless we settle the question,

15:34.583 --> 15:36.917
and put that poor thing
out of its misery.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.083
Close the damn portal.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.959
Tell the world it's over.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.208
You'll save many lives.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.875
Including your own.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.875
I need to reach Command.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.709
Is this a bribe?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.166
You have to help me.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.417
Don't worry, ma'am.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.834
The Planetary Defense Coalition
is here.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.458
(clatters)

16:17.750 --> 16:19.458
(sighs deeply)

16:19.542 --> 16:21.709
What'd you expect?

16:21.792 --> 16:25.166
They were gonna lay down
their lives for something
that gives them nightmares?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.208
-They know what's at stake.
-Stripe: Which is what, exactly?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.375
Why'd the Major say,
"Close the portal"?

16:30.458 --> 16:32.709
I thought they'd close
once the Galanthi get through.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.333
Not this one.
It's stable. It's--

16:35.417 --> 16:38.417
Command think it's what the team
were helping it build.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.625
Reinforcements?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.208
You think there's more comin'.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.125
Maybe the 20 were scouts.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.750
Maybe the Galanthi
are just getting started.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.792
This could be where
we turn the tide.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.500
Do the job the PDC
was formed to do.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.583
There's still time.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.917
Nobody has to die.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.458
Yeah.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.250
Feel like someone's gonna.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.959
(keys beeping)

17:10.291 --> 17:12.709
Scientist (over computer):
It's hard to believe
we're finally here.

17:12.792 --> 17:17.792
Everyone appreciates
the gravity of what
this might mean. (laughs)

17:17.875 --> 17:22.250
Okay. Almost everyone
can appreciate the gravity--

17:22.333 --> 17:26.083
Okay!
What are you after? Huh?

17:26.166 --> 17:28.792
Do you want to do my report?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.166
I never expected
such playfulness.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.250
But seriously,
the team have worked hard,

17:34.333 --> 17:37.333
they deserve
their celebration today.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.709
-(clicking)
-(Major grunts)

17:39.792 --> 17:42.542
How does a free-thinking
man like yourself

17:42.625 --> 17:45.500
get so egregiously split-tailed?

17:47.041 --> 17:48.959
I know you wanna
walk out of here.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.375
To where? The planet's fucked.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.959
I don't like the Galanthi,
but we need them to survive.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.750
What if thousands of them
come through that rift?

17:58.834 --> 18:01.583
Millions?

18:01.667 --> 18:04.458
What if that freak downstairs
is just a pet,

18:04.542 --> 18:06.250
sniffing us out?

18:08.417 --> 18:10.291
It's the Crescent's call.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.709
He doesn't wanna make that call.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.834
And he left you with me.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.834
Okay, then. We move it.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.667
Can't. The storm is bringing
a static front.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.792
Any kinetic movement,
your muscles explode.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.375
You know what?
You win.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.375
-What did I win?
-Whatever you want.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.917
Whatever's here that's
gonna make you step up
and give a shit.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.667
We've got a great selection.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.625
Name your poison.

18:39.709 --> 18:42.667
Can I mix, or do I just get one?

18:42.750 --> 18:45.041
We are this close to winning.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.000
Not the war, but the world.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.291
Imagine winning the planet back.
Making it livable.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.583
Floods, famine, terra-storms.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.333
The Galanthi can make them stop.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.041
-Then where are they?
-(gun clacks)

18:58.125 --> 19:00.959
The portal's stable.
Why aren't they galloping
through?

19:01.041 --> 19:03.625
-It's probably not finished.
-Why didn't they come before?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.417
What about
the five billion people

19:05.500 --> 19:09.834
that your great brainosaurs
came too late to save?

19:09.917 --> 19:12.125
-They're not gods.
-Then stop praying to 'em.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.291
(rumbling, clinking)

19:29.250 --> 19:31.291
Can you do one thing for me?

19:33.333 --> 19:36.834
Can you just hope
that we make it right?

19:38.834 --> 19:41.667
I'm not afraid to fight,
if that's what it takes.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.166
But it has to be for a purpose.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.792
It has to matter.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.000
-To you.
-You don't get to ask that.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.834
-I just did.
-No.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.083
-(gun clacks)
-You cannot.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.709
Twenty-eight years of slogging
through blood and shit

19:54.792 --> 19:56.542
-and towering disappointment...
-Oh, don't war story me.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.542
-I've been in it.
-...has buried me here,
likely forever.

19:58.625 --> 20:02.083
And I am not gonna die
waiting on a savior.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.250
You're just really insistent
that we have to die.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.959
Because this close is
where we always end up.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.667
It's where we all fold.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.875
This close, change is too scary,

20:12.959 --> 20:14.500
even for the people
who fight for it.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.291
That's why FreeLife always wins.

20:16.375 --> 20:20.417
-They don't always win.
-They own history.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.834
One fuckin' form or another,
the man who has the club--

20:22.917 --> 20:24.917
I've heard all of this,
and I know it's not so.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.458
Because you are spored.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.834
Because I was FreeLife.

20:31.166 --> 20:32.834
Born and raised.

20:39.166 --> 20:44.083
I've done things that
you can't imagine.

20:44.166 --> 20:49.542
And the spores,
they didn't make me
brilliant or brainwashed.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.500
They were a question.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.291
And it turns out that

20:55.375 --> 21:00.250
nothing will crack this world
harder than one gentle question.

21:02.417 --> 21:06.250
So, yes. I hope...

21:08.208 --> 21:09.875
for a better world.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.166
(sighs softly)

21:14.333 --> 21:16.875
-(beeping)
-No.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.041
(power surging)

21:24.375 --> 21:25.917
Fuckin' no!

21:26.000 --> 21:27.458

21:42.458 --> 21:44.250
(distant thud)

21:50.208 --> 21:53.000
Major:
The only way you live
is if it dies.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.625
We have to get rid of it.

21:54.709 --> 21:58.291
Byner:
You moron. You already did.
It's leaving!

21:58.375 --> 22:01.041
(grunts)
There's no reinforcements!

22:01.125 --> 22:03.750
(grunts)
The rift is stable,

22:03.834 --> 22:05.667
'cause it goes the other way.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.250
Galanthi's not getting help.
It's getting out.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.041
Nah. Nah, that--

22:10.125 --> 22:12.208
That feels just a bit
too convenient.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.000
-(firing)

22:16.792 --> 22:18.291
(panting)

(rumbling)

22:24.625 --> 22:26.125
No.

22:26.208 --> 22:28.959
-Please, don't leave us.
-Stripe: Can we cut the power?

22:29.041 --> 22:31.125
Rex must have tripped
the safety.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.291
The Galanthi locked us out.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.041
He's got enough power
now to--

22:35.125 --> 22:37.875
to get up to the portal,
and... Aah!

22:37.959 --> 22:39.959
Hey, can I get
a fuckin' Knitter here?

22:40.041 --> 22:41.792
I'm bleeding out!

22:45.625 --> 22:47.750
You were right.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.417
It was always
gonna end like this.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.041
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

22:51.125 --> 22:53.250
Crescent:
Boot! Stand the fuck down!

22:53.333 --> 22:57.000
-Good man.
-Who's the best at
playing possum now?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.333
She is.

22:59.417 --> 23:00.667

23:01.542 --> 23:03.542

23:10.375 --> 23:12.291
Crescent:
Stay with me.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.208
(panting)

23:21.083 --> 23:23.792
I don't understand.

23:23.875 --> 23:27.458
They... They gave up.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.709
(distant rumbling)

23:29.792 --> 23:32.875
-They gave up on--
-Stripe: No. Shh.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.291
-Shh.
-I'm sorry.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.792
Stripe:
Hey. Look at me.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.166
Hey.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.667
-(whimpers)
-The Galanthi is going
back for help.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.625
Believe me, okay?

23:45.709 --> 23:49.000
I believe there's hope.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.709
-Please hope.

40:51.375 --> 40:53.083
No! (screaming)

40:53.166 --> 40:54.417
I've done this before.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.291
-I can tell.
-No.

40:56.375 --> 40:58.250
No. I...

40:58.333 --> 41:01.166
-(door closes)
-No, I saw it
the day I came here.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.375
I thought it was a sim...

41:03.458 --> 41:05.625
-mptom.
-It's all right.

41:05.709 --> 41:10.542
I'm gonna sew you up.
I just need a nurse to...

41:10.625 --> 41:13.083
(faint whirring)

41:20.959 --> 41:22.417
Please.

41:29.250 --> 41:33.917
(energy humming)

41:40.250 --> 41:42.750
It's a lot to take in.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.959
No. No, no.

41:45.041 --> 41:48.166
Aliens from the future
gave us magic powers.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.583
It was staring me in the face.

41:50.667 --> 41:53.792
Well, you've seen ailments
you can't explain

41:53.875 --> 41:55.208
last few weeks, yeah?

41:55.291 --> 41:57.875
Here in the ward, yes.
But I'm not...

41:57.959 --> 41:59.792
Insane?

42:00.542 --> 42:01.625
A woman.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.583
Well, there's gotta be more.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.333
The spores don't affect
everyone they hit.

42:08.417 --> 42:11.041
I never understood why.

42:11.125 --> 42:15.542
But they don't normally
cause random powers.

42:15.625 --> 42:18.500
There's a pattern I'm missing.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.583
Wish they'd let us
read the papers.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.083
Why are you telling me
all of this?

42:23.166 --> 42:26.000
-I trust you.
-Why?

42:26.083 --> 42:31.083
-Did... did you see
something in--
-No. No. I...

42:31.166 --> 42:33.542
Should I trust you?

42:33.625 --> 42:35.500
Do you think I'm insane?

42:36.625 --> 42:37.834
Maybe.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.125
Maybe your alien was.

42:45.333 --> 42:47.333
They were torturing it.

42:50.333 --> 42:53.208
I don't know if
this is good news.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.500
But you were right.
People are hiding it,

42:57.583 --> 42:59.291
but it's all over.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.125
Amalia:
No one's spored,

43:02.208 --> 43:03.625
empathically enhanced.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.667
There's no one
here to guide us.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.333
To say here's what
needs to change.

43:08.417 --> 43:11.375
Or... What?

43:13.417 --> 43:15.000
-Fuck you.
-No, I'm--

43:15.083 --> 43:18.625
No, I... Fuck you.
I was a mistake.

43:18.709 --> 43:20.792
A mean joke. I'm a Stripe.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.583
I'm not good.

43:22.667 --> 43:25.917
I've got issues you literally
don't have names for yet.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.542
I might be why
the spores were shit.

43:27.625 --> 43:31.208
-You know what's coming.
And you care.
-I did my time!

43:31.291 --> 43:35.667
I spent a lifetime fighting
and it didn't make any...

43:38.792 --> 43:40.959
Why would it put me in this?

43:41.041 --> 43:43.542
Yeah, this doughy little frame.
It's perfect.

43:43.625 --> 43:46.166
I got world-class tits,
but I can't see over a chair.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.625
It's a...

43:48.333 --> 43:50.250
...good frame.

43:51.917 --> 43:53.917
And nobody was using it.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.500
I gotta get out of this place.

44:07.583 --> 44:11.917
Then you might not want
to say "fuck" quite so often.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And give me back my morphine.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.458
Fuck!

44:15.542 --> 44:18.500
Lester says just a few weeks.

44:18.583 --> 44:21.125
I do feel so much better.

44:21.208 --> 44:22.875
I miss his cooking, though.

44:22.959 --> 44:24.917
A man who cooks.

44:25.041 --> 44:28.417
(in British accent):
A man... who cooks.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.709
He said the light might
have been a German balloon.

44:31.792 --> 44:33.542
A zeppelin.

44:33.625 --> 44:37.083
He doesn't know
what's going on about God.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.750
How He's gonna
give us a mission.

44:53.959 --> 44:57.041
I've been hearing about you two.
Which one is Amelia?

44:57.125 --> 44:59.875
Amalia. Molly.

44:59.959 --> 45:02.375
Then you must be Sarah.

45:02.458 --> 45:04.041
(laughs softly)

45:04.125 --> 45:06.000
What, uh...

45:06.083 --> 45:08.417
(with British accent):
What have you been hearing?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.083
Well, first of all,

45:10.166 --> 45:14.166
that you two may be among
the-- the Touched.

45:15.750 --> 45:18.583
That's what they're calling
these people who've...

45:18.667 --> 45:21.375
blossomed these
last few months.

45:21.458 --> 45:22.709
"Touched."

45:22.792 --> 45:24.500
They called me that already.

45:25.250 --> 45:28.458
(laughs)

45:28.542 --> 45:30.083
I'll tell you what, Sarah,

45:30.166 --> 45:33.792
I'm looking for someone
to do a special study with

45:33.875 --> 45:35.458
at my facility.

45:35.542 --> 45:39.083
I'd like to spend a minute
with each of you.

45:39.166 --> 45:40.750
One on one.

45:40.834 --> 45:42.375
Can you give me a minute

45:42.458 --> 45:44.417
-with Amel-- Amalia?
-(chuckles)

45:44.500 --> 45:47.667
And then you and I
can have our own little chat?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.375
(footsteps departing)

46:03.583 --> 46:06.875
They tell me that
you can see the future.

46:07.667 --> 46:10.709
No, I... feel it.

46:10.792 --> 46:15.250
Suddenly. Like I'm falling down.

46:15.333 --> 46:19.542
But I'm not.
And then later, I do.

46:21.834 --> 46:24.333
Once, I smelled oat cakes,

46:24.417 --> 46:26.542
and we had them that night.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.208
I don't like to think
about it too much.

46:32.291 --> 46:33.875
It hurts a little.

46:33.959 --> 46:35.709
I wouldn't want to study it.

46:35.792 --> 46:37.792
It's not a volunteer study.

46:39.083 --> 46:41.041
Tell me...

46:41.834 --> 46:43.583
about the lights.

46:45.542 --> 46:47.125
Sorry?

46:47.208 --> 46:50.500
Dr. Hague:
The lights in the sky.

46:50.583 --> 46:52.625
When you were admitted.

46:52.709 --> 46:56.083
I didn't see any lights.
I was...

46:56.166 --> 46:58.500
Well, I fell in the river.

46:58.583 --> 47:01.709

I don't remember.

-The Matron said you were
very outspoken about--
-It was Sarah.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.583
She was terribly upset. She...

47:16.667 --> 47:18.834
said she saw God in the sky,

47:18.917 --> 47:20.875
and no one would believe her.

47:20.959 --> 47:25.625
I lied. Because, well,
she wouldn't stop crying, and...

47:25.709 --> 47:27.542
Well, she never let it go,

47:27.625 --> 47:30.625
and I couldn't tell her
that I...

47:32.208 --> 47:35.041
When the weird things happened,

47:35.125 --> 47:38.417
she said it was proof that
there was a "mission"?

Please don't tell Matron
what I did.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.667
I just wanted Sarah to be happy.

47:43.750 --> 47:46.458
