00:01.709 --> 00:04.125
AMALIA TRUE:
Three years ago, I woke up
knowing things that I shouldn't

00:04.834 --> 00:06.125
and was declared insane.

00:06.417 --> 00:08.375
So, yes, I keep secrets.

00:08.917 --> 00:12.959
She's not a fool,
and she's not a fucking baker.

00:16.125 --> 00:18.458
The attack came three years ago.

00:18.792 --> 00:19.959
This was designed

00:20.041 --> 00:23.375
so that we would see the parts,
not the whole.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.709
Maladie is the worst killer
in London's history.

00:27.792 --> 00:29.250
HORATIO COUSENS:
You know who I work with?

00:29.333 --> 00:32.959
Is this true?
You two must be dear friends.

00:33.959 --> 00:36.792
Or you do go back a ways.
We all do.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.041
Its power grows by the day.
It means to destroy us.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.458
If we've lost hope...

00:44.333 --> 00:45.458
it already has.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.375
PENANCE ADAIR:
I'm going to the square
to stop that hanging.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.000
I'm going to save Maladie.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.834
LORD GILBERT MASSEN:
If London is going
to be saved from chaos...

00:55.500 --> 00:57.041
it needs to see chaos.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.166
(CLAMORING)

01:03.542 --> 01:05.542
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

01:06.000 --> 01:07.250
TRUE:
I do have a mission.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.208
I am leaving to find
the Galanthi as we've planned.

01:10.792 --> 01:12.083
It's the first step to learning

01:12.166 --> 01:13.500
why we were brought here
together

01:14.375 --> 01:15.625
and what we're meant to do next.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.375
(engine roaring)

01:30.208 --> 01:32.875
(explosions)

01:38.875 --> 01:40.417
(gunfire)

01:40.500 --> 01:42.208
Cryer (on comms):
Give up your name!

01:42.291 --> 01:44.125
Give up your
blasphemous fight

01:44.208 --> 01:46.125
and join the FreeLife Army.

01:46.208 --> 01:49.542
We are marauders.
We are God's Men!

01:52.250 --> 01:53.875
What's your name, girl?

01:53.959 --> 01:56.625
Crescent (on comms):
Second Boot, hold.
That's just a Cryer.

01:56.709 --> 01:57.959
Byner, are we close?

01:58.041 --> 01:59.291
Byner (on comms):
We're right on top of it.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.709
Point of entry,
north side, 20 paces.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.834
Crescent (on comms):
Boot, confirm entry point.

02:03.917 --> 02:06.333
The rest, take his spot.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.417
Cryer (on comms):
Give up your name.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.291
Give up your
blasphemous fight

02:10.375 --> 02:12.208
and join the FreeLife Army.

02:12.291 --> 02:14.709
We are marauders.
We are God's Men!

02:14.792 --> 02:16.375
Crescent (on comms):
What do you see?

02:16.458 --> 02:18.542
Boot (on comms):
Found the point of entry.
It's a ladder.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.333
-Can't see how far
down it goes...
-(firing, yells)

02:20.417 --> 02:22.709
-Crescent: Boot! Go now! Move!
-Boot: Contact!

02:22.792 --> 02:24.750
-(gunfire)
-We're taking fire.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.500
-Multiple hostiles!
-(grunts)

02:26.583 --> 02:28.875
(yelling, grunting)

02:28.959 --> 02:30.542
Major:
Steady, soldier.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.709
We kill you all,
it's gon' be slow.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.834
Or maybe we could
talk about the prize

02:35.917 --> 02:37.959
that brought us all here
in the first place.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.250
(whirring)

02:39.333 --> 02:41.083
-(thudding)
-(gasps)

02:41.166 --> 02:42.625

02:44.458 --> 02:46.208
-(yells)
-(gasps)

02:46.291 --> 02:48.792
(retches, coughs)

02:52.125 --> 02:55.792
Crescent (on comms):
You are now captives
of the PDC.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.583
(distant gunfire)

03:01.041 --> 03:02.291
(grunts)

03:05.125 --> 03:08.250
â™ª

03:15.458 --> 03:17.750

(grunts)

03:26.417 --> 03:28.291
(exhales)

03:30.667 --> 03:32.709
Byner:
Oh, my blood,
there's heat.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.083
Crescent:
Get me fuckin' light.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.166
(doors whir open)

03:38.250 --> 03:39.583
(door closes)

03:39.667 --> 03:40.917
-(grunts)
-(beeps)

03:41.000 --> 03:42.291
Air's good.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.417
Byner, lights.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.375
(grunts, pants)

03:50.250 --> 03:51.709
Byner:
The whole system's gated.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.834
Rex can't tap the O.S.
without a hard connect.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.041
-Send little Rex.
-Major: Rex.

03:56.125 --> 03:59.083
PDC creates A.I.,
forgets the I.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.417
Like your systems
didn't clone our O.S.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.542
Don't you listen to him.
You're a good bot.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.291
You got any surprises
waiting in here?

04:06.375 --> 04:08.917
I dearly hope so,
given the circumstances.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.625
We were tracking the source
of the spatial anomaly,

04:15.709 --> 04:17.291
same as you.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.208
It was a FreeLife beacon
that tagged this place.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.542
I don't know if they got inside.

04:23.917 --> 04:26.375
Second Boot, tape his mouth.

04:26.458 --> 04:29.250
-First tell me your name.
-Names are sacred, shitto.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.250
My name is Major Joseph
Willing Greenbone,

04:32.333 --> 04:33.625
FreeLife for life!

04:33.709 --> 04:36.625
We do not hide from God
like you PDC dogs.

04:36.709 --> 04:41.500
-We honor-- (grunts)
-Boot, say hello.

04:41.583 --> 04:45.417
Boot (on comms):
We are the
Planetary Defense Coalition.

04:46.792 --> 04:49.041
We are taking shelter here.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.291
We've not come to fight,
but we are armed,

04:53.375 --> 04:56.041
and will respond as greeted.

05:03.583 --> 05:07.166
Hey. What's a Stripe
doing here alone?

05:07.250 --> 05:09.500
-And why didn't we
read her heat?
-She possumed.

05:09.583 --> 05:12.291
She swallowed glazers.
I watched her gurge 'em up.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.750
-Her body temp
must've been nil.
-Shit.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.041
(beeping, whirring)

05:22.542 --> 05:23.875
(chimes)

05:33.083 --> 05:34.750
You swallowed coolant pods?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.291
(grunts softly)

05:36.375 --> 05:39.750
The heat change'll
shred your organs
if you don't relax.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.667
Is your stomach coated?

05:45.709 --> 05:47.125
Pheen.

05:47.917 --> 05:49.667
I can't give you pheen.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.792
You'll never level
if you're zoned.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.959
Byner:
All clear. Got a schematic.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.291
Who's a good bot?

05:59.041 --> 06:00.500
Anything upstairs?

06:00.583 --> 06:03.750
Then we're alone.
Which seems wrong.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.375
Stripe hasn't called colors.

06:06.458 --> 06:10.000
-What's your Pride?
-Forty-first Ground,
out of Edinburgh.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.000
No one got out of Edinburgh.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.709
Three of us did.
The other two died
on the walk down.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.083
Sixteenth Hailstormers,
D-field Green.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.500
Our Stripe got taken out,
if you're mission fit.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.625
I need to get her
regulated first.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.250
She was possuming out there.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.250
Also, there's a bullet
in my leg.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.875
Sick bay's northeast quarter.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.333
So ordered.
Boots, secure the "Major,"
and do a full sweep.

06:33.417 --> 06:36.041
Byner and I will try to
contact Command.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.417
I've never seen anyone possum
in this kind of cold.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.041
I was running out of options.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.083
Twenty FreeLife Marauders
dropped in an hour
before you did.

06:43.166 --> 06:46.166
Twenty? Our scanners read eight.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.000
I had an hour.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.709
(grunts)

06:55.333 --> 06:57.208
(groans)

06:57.291 --> 07:00.000
-(exhales)
-Knitter: Lucky,
you being where you were.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.834
Didn't feel that lucky.

07:02.917 --> 07:06.208
-Pheen. Shit is weak.
-You get nothing pure.

07:06.291 --> 07:09.375
Popping glazers?
That's not playing dead.
That's practicing.

07:09.458 --> 07:12.375
-What's your PitSid level?
-(inhales)

07:12.458 --> 07:15.166
Too high to make Crescent,
too high to go home.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.917
Everyone has PitSid.
I got the most.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.417
You get temporals? Flashbacks?

07:20.500 --> 07:24.834
I'm not even sure this is now.

07:24.917 --> 07:28.333
Great. You're mission fit.
You gotta jar me.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.000
Oof.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.542
You gonna ask me
what the mission is?

07:34.625 --> 07:36.667
You're looking for a Galanthi.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.417
-(clicks)
-(yells, grunts)

07:41.166 --> 07:43.750
(cylinder whirring)

07:46.333 --> 07:48.417
(vials clattering)

07:49.458 --> 07:51.417
(cylinder hissing)

07:52.542 --> 07:54.083
(grunts)

07:55.125 --> 07:57.667
-Who are you?
-My name?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.458
That's a little forward.

07:59.542 --> 08:02.959
I was married for three years,
and I never told either of them.

08:04.709 --> 08:08.250
Come on.
Fighting over a side post
in the middle of nothing

08:08.333 --> 08:11.375
'cause you saw a...
spatial anomaly,

08:11.458 --> 08:14.875
which means a portal,
which is how the Galanthi
came here,

08:14.959 --> 08:18.250
I figure Command saw
the FreeLife beacon,
lost their shit.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.583
Sent your Pride in
'cause they were close,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.959
and 'cause you are a spore.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.041
Can I have my pheen back?

08:29.125 --> 08:30.917
(mouths):
Fuck.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.959
And the term is
"empathically enhanced."

08:36.041 --> 08:37.667
"Spore" is a little rude.

08:37.750 --> 08:41.125
Yeah. But only a spore
would call me on it.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.333
Why is it rude?

08:44.417 --> 08:47.375
Don't the Galanthi
rain spores on everyone?

08:47.458 --> 08:49.834
Make 'em all wise and adorable?

08:49.917 --> 08:51.667
Knitter:
The spores are translators.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.333
They activate parts of the mind

08:53.417 --> 08:56.792
needed to comprehend Galanthi
language and tech.

08:57.625 --> 08:58.917
Not that I can.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.375
I've never even seen one.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.667
But it does broaden
the perspective.

09:07.166 --> 09:09.083
What were these guys building?

09:09.166 --> 09:12.083
-Museum?
-When was this even from?

09:12.166 --> 09:15.875
Well, it's late Victorian.
Maybe early 20th?

09:16.959 --> 09:19.041
Wasn't always a soldier.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.750
-Knitter: Are those sim-strips?
-Boatload.

09:25.834 --> 09:28.583
Byner can go through them.
He lives in sims.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.291
Not just the fuck-tech.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.542
Mostly the fuck-tech.

09:33.625 --> 09:36.333
Stripe:
Please tell me he's not virgan.

09:36.417 --> 09:39.083
All that "flesh is evil" crap.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.458
What is this?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.625
Every Galanthi project is huge.

09:45.709 --> 09:50.083
Pure water systems,
tectonic stabilizers.
This is...

09:50.166 --> 09:51.834
None of those are happening.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.875
FreeLife bombed every site.
Killed them.

09:57.583 --> 10:02.041
All of 'em?
Weren't there, what,
20 Galanthi?

10:02.125 --> 10:04.625
-How many of them
are still alive?
-Maybe one.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.417
Maybe more.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.250
Command didn't know
about this one.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.458
Well, so far, neither do we.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.875
Second Boot (screams):
Fuck! Heat!

10:15.834 --> 10:18.458
What the fuck is that?

10:18.542 --> 10:20.125
Get the Crescent.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.333
-Is that the Galanthi?
-Slow.

10:22.417 --> 10:26.417
And quiet.
You don't wanna
wake this thing up.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.250
Damn, those kids are gray.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.291
(power surging)

10:49.083 --> 10:53.917
â™ª

11:11.417 --> 11:16.875
-(footsteps approaching)
-Knitter: Hey, whoa, whoa.
It's just a garden.

11:16.959 --> 11:20.583
Yeah, no, it's just something
out of a farmer's daughter's sim

11:20.667 --> 11:22.417
sitting here in real life.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.709
So normal and usual.
Food made out of actual food.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.625
Nobody eat anything yet.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.375
We got a door here.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.458
Crescent:
Byner, what's the schematic say?

11:37.792 --> 11:39.750
That there isn't a door here.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.959
(clinking)

11:50.417 --> 11:54.375
â™ª

12:01.291 --> 12:05.834
(ominous music playing)

12:11.500 --> 12:13.875
It's the science team.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.000
FreeLife got 'em.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.417
FreeLife don't hide their kills.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.291
Stripe:
Or clean up after.

12:25.375 --> 12:29.375
This shaft goes way down.
They were hiding
whatever's below us.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.333
Another level?

12:32.417 --> 12:35.291
Crescent:
Byner, any other doors
that shouldn't be there?

12:35.375 --> 12:37.375
(door whirs open)

12:41.583 --> 12:43.709
(panting)

12:50.875 --> 12:54.917
â™ª

12:59.458 --> 13:01.166
(beeps, whirs)

13:02.041 --> 13:03.834
(grunting)

13:09.792 --> 13:11.709
(screaming)

13:14.417 --> 13:16.125
-Crescent: Hold.
-(device chiming)

13:21.417 --> 13:24.125
Is-- Is that--

13:24.208 --> 13:27.208
That's blood.
That's human blood.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.583
-Fuck me!
-(gasping)

13:32.875 --> 13:34.834
There's a shaft right above it.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.834
This is why they
hung the bodies there.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.291
-What, they were feeding it?
-Knitter: What? No.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.542
Galanthi don't drink blood
for food.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.875
What's it doing?

13:42.959 --> 13:45.166
Stripe:
Pride, stay calm.
This is fat glass.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.583
Bullets will do nothing
but bounce back.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.125
Whoa.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.917
(rumbling)

13:58.500 --> 14:00.625
-(firing)
-(bullets ricocheting)

14:00.709 --> 14:01.792
(slashing)

14:01.875 --> 14:03.792
-(choking)
-(splashing)

14:06.041 --> 14:07.792
Major:
Oh, I remember now.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.792
The boys that found
this place did get in.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.709
They didn't have the firepower
to kill a Galanthi,

14:13.792 --> 14:15.458
so they improvised.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.291
Lit the beacon and got clean,
in case we sent nukes.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.834
-Just kill this shitto.
-No. We are completely
off mission here.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.417
We were tasked to
save the Galanthi,

14:23.500 --> 14:25.250
and you all shot at it,
and hit one of ours!

14:25.333 --> 14:27.542
-She is not one of ours.
-Don't shrill at a superior.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.417
-We were repelling an advance.
-Knitter: It wasn't an advance.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.041
-It was a fucking handshake.
-Byner: Yeah,
we weren't overly briefed

14:32.125 --> 14:33.834
-on how all this would--
-What about the blood?

14:33.917 --> 14:37.125
-Why would the FreeLife
go to all of that--
-Torture.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.333
(scoffs)
We saw the bodies, genius.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.750
Not the team.
The team was
just the method.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.917
'Cause the Galanthi
bonded with 'em.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.500
Cared for them.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.417
It's basic torture protocol.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.000
You always do the family first.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.041
I would love to know your name.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.750
Second Boot:
How could they get information
from the Galanthi?

14:56.834 --> 15:00.834
Oh, Dainty, torture's
not about information.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.834
Crescent:
It's about hope.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.917
Removing the concept of hope.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.208
But we've done all right.

15:08.291 --> 15:11.291
We're all running hot,
but we found the Galanthi.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.625
And it is still alive.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.208
Well, now, that's
actually your problem.

15:16.291 --> 15:20.208
I called for a full incursion
the moment we met resistance.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.917
Thanks for the intel, big mouth.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.834
So did we. (scoffs)
Wait. Shit...

15:25.917 --> 15:29.125
So, a full engagement
20 feet above our heads?

15:29.208 --> 15:30.875
Nuclear bombs flying everywhere.

15:30.959 --> 15:33.041
We'll never survive that.
Nothing will.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.500
Unless we settle the question,

15:34.583 --> 15:36.917
and put that poor thing
out of its misery.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.083
Close the damn portal.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.959
Tell the world it's over.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.208
You'll save many lives.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.875
Including your own.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.875
I need to reach Command.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.709
Is this a bribe?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.166
You have to help me.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.417
Don't worry, ma'am.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.834
The Planetary Defense Coalition
is here.

16:14.917 --> 16:16.458
(clatters)

16:17.750 --> 16:19.458
(sighs deeply)

16:19.542 --> 16:21.709
What'd you expect?

16:21.792 --> 16:25.166
They were gonna lay down
their lives for something
that gives them nightmares?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.208
-They know what's at stake.
-Stripe: Which is what, exactly?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.375
Why'd the Major say,
"Close the portal"?

16:30.458 --> 16:32.709
I thought they'd close
once the Galanthi get through.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.333
Not this one.
It's stable. It's--

16:35.417 --> 16:38.417
Command think it's what the team
were helping it build.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.625
Reinforcements?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.208
You think there's more comin'.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.125
Maybe the 20 were scouts.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.750
Maybe the Galanthi
are just getting started.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.792
This could be where
we turn the tide.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.500
Do the job the PDC
was formed to do.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.583
There's still time.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.917
Nobody has to die.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.458
Yeah.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.250
Feel like someone's gonna.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.959
(keys beeping)

17:10.291 --> 17:12.709
Scientist (over computer):
It's hard to believe
we're finally here.

17:12.792 --> 17:17.792
Everyone appreciates
the gravity of what
this might mean. (laughs)

17:17.875 --> 17:22.250
Okay. Almost everyone
can appreciate the gravity--

17:22.333 --> 17:26.083
Okay!
What are you after? Huh?

17:26.166 --> 17:28.792
Do you want to do my report?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.166
I never expected
such playfulness.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.250
But seriously,
the team have worked hard,

17:34.333 --> 17:37.333
they deserve
their celebration today.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.709
-(clicking)
-(Major grunts)

17:39.792 --> 17:42.542
How does a free-thinking
man like yourself

17:42.625 --> 17:45.500
get so egregiously split-tailed?

17:47.041 --> 17:48.959
I know you wanna
walk out of here.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.375
To where? The planet's fucked.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.959
I don't like the Galanthi,
but we need them to survive.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.750
What if thousands of them
come through that rift?

17:58.834 --> 18:01.583
Millions?

18:01.667 --> 18:04.458
What if that freak downstairs
is just a pet,

18:04.542 --> 18:06.250
sniffing us out?

18:08.417 --> 18:10.291
It's the Crescent's call.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.709
He doesn't wanna make that call.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.834
And he left you with me.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.834
Okay, then. We move it.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.667
Can't. The storm is bringing
a static front.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.792
Any kinetic movement,
your muscles explode.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.375
You know what?
You win.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.375
-What did I win?
-Whatever you want.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.917
Whatever's here that's
gonna make you step up
and give a shit.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.667
We've got a great selection.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.625
Name your poison.

18:39.709 --> 18:42.667
Can I mix, or do I just get one?

18:42.750 --> 18:45.041
We are this close to winning.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.000
Not the war, but the world.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.291
Imagine winning the planet back.
Making it livable.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.583
Floods, famine, terra-storms.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.333
The Galanthi can make them stop.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.041
-Then where are they?
-(gun clacks)

18:58.125 --> 19:00.959
The portal's stable.
Why aren't they galloping
through?

19:01.041 --> 19:03.625
-It's probably not finished.
-Why didn't they come before?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.417
What about
the five billion people

19:05.500 --> 19:09.834
that your great brainosaurs
came too late to save?

19:09.917 --> 19:12.125
-They're not gods.
-Then stop praying to 'em.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.291
(rumbling, clinking)

19:29.250 --> 19:31.291
Can you do one thing for me?

19:33.333 --> 19:36.834
Can you just hope
that we make it right?

19:38.834 --> 19:41.667
I'm not afraid to fight,
if that's what it takes.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.166
But it has to be for a purpose.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.792
It has to matter.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.000
-To you.
-You don't get to ask that.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.834
-I just did.
-No.

19:49.917 --> 19:52.083
-(gun clacks)
-You cannot.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.709
Twenty-eight years of slogging
through blood and shit

19:54.792 --> 19:56.542
-and towering disappointment...
-Oh, don't war story me.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.542
-I've been in it.
-...has buried me here,
likely forever.

19:58.625 --> 20:02.083
And I am not gonna die
waiting on a savior.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.250
You're just really insistent
that we have to die.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.959
Because this close is
where we always end up.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.667
It's where we all fold.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.875
This close, change is too scary,

20:12.959 --> 20:14.500
even for the people
who fight for it.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.291
That's why FreeLife always wins.

20:16.375 --> 20:20.417
-They don't always win.
-They own history.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.834
One fuckin' form or another,
the man who has the club--

20:22.917 --> 20:24.917
I've heard all of this,
and I know it's not so.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.458
Because you are spored.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.834
Because I was FreeLife.

20:31.166 --> 20:32.834
Born and raised.

20:39.166 --> 20:44.083
I've done things that
you can't imagine.

20:44.166 --> 20:49.542
And the spores,
they didn't make me
brilliant or brainwashed.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.500
They were a question.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.291
And it turns out that

20:55.375 --> 21:00.250
nothing will crack this world
harder than one gentle question.

21:02.417 --> 21:06.250
So, yes. I hope...

21:08.208 --> 21:09.875
for a better world.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.166
(sighs softly)

21:14.333 --> 21:16.875
-(beeping)
-No.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.041
(power surging)

21:24.375 --> 21:25.917
Fuckin' no!

21:26.000 --> 21:27.458
(sparking)

21:27.542 --> 21:29.417
(bot squeals)

21:31.041 --> 21:33.583
(distant gunfire)

21:42.458 --> 21:44.250
(distant thud)

21:50.208 --> 21:53.000
Major:
The only way you live
is if it dies.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.625
We have to get rid of it.

21:54.709 --> 21:58.291
Byner:
You moron. You already did.
It's leaving!

21:58.375 --> 22:01.041
(grunts)
There's no reinforcements!

22:01.125 --> 22:03.750
(grunts)
The rift is stable,

22:03.834 --> 22:05.667
'cause it goes the other way.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.250
Galanthi's not getting help.
It's getting out.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.041
Nah. Nah, that--

22:10.125 --> 22:12.208
That feels just a bit
too convenient.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.000
-(firing)
-(grunting)

22:16.792 --> 22:18.291
(panting)

22:21.125 --> 22:24.542
(rumbling)

22:24.625 --> 22:26.125
No.

22:26.208 --> 22:28.959
-Please, don't leave us.
-Stripe: Can we cut the power?

22:29.041 --> 22:31.125
Rex must have tripped
the safety.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.291
The Galanthi locked us out.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.041
He's got enough power
now to--

22:35.125 --> 22:37.875
to get up to the portal,
and... Aah!

22:37.959 --> 22:39.959
Hey, can I get
a fuckin' Knitter here?

22:40.041 --> 22:41.792
I'm bleeding out!

22:45.625 --> 22:47.750
You were right.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.417
It was always
gonna end like this.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.041
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

22:51.125 --> 22:53.250
Crescent:
Boot! Stand the fuck down!

22:53.333 --> 22:57.000
-Good man.
-Who's the best at
playing possum now?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.333
She is.

22:59.417 --> 23:00.667
(gunshots)

23:01.542 --> 23:03.542
(grunting softly)

23:08.333 --> 23:10.291
(grunting)

23:10.375 --> 23:12.291
Crescent:
Stay with me.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.208
(panting)

23:21.083 --> 23:23.792
I don't understand.

23:23.875 --> 23:27.458
They... They gave up.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.709
(distant rumbling)

23:29.792 --> 23:32.875
-They gave up on--
-Stripe: No. Shh.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.291
-Shh.
-I'm sorry.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.792
Stripe:
Hey. Look at me.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.166
Hey.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.667
-(whimpers)
-The Galanthi is going
back for help.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.625
Believe me, okay?

23:45.709 --> 23:49.000
I believe there's hope.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.709
-Please hope.
-(Knitter sniffles)

23:55.667 --> 23:57.041
(sniffles)

23:59.500 --> 24:03.542
Do you wish to
tell me your name?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.667
H...

24:26.625 --> 24:30.417
â™ª

24:39.417 --> 24:43.417
â™ª

25:07.208 --> 25:09.125
-(gulps)
-(bottle clatters)

25:12.208 --> 25:13.458
(lid pops)

25:18.417 --> 25:20.083
(clatters)

25:20.166 --> 25:21.959
(moans softly)

25:23.625 --> 25:28.083
â™ª

25:38.000 --> 25:40.250
â™ª

25:40.333 --> 25:43.208
(energy whirring)

25:53.959 --> 25:56.750
(uplifting music playing)

25:56.834 --> 25:59.208
â™ª

26:01.291 --> 26:03.291
(exploding)

26:14.834 --> 26:18.083
(light classical music playing)

26:18.166 --> 26:20.250
â™ª

26:33.458 --> 26:36.417
(distant indistinct chatter)

26:38.667 --> 26:40.709
Aren't those
sweet little things?

26:40.792 --> 26:42.166
Varnum!

26:42.250 --> 26:44.625
Didn't expect to
see you at this hour.

26:44.709 --> 26:47.375
-They've got us in early
for the inventory.
-Mmm.

26:47.458 --> 26:48.458
What are they?

26:48.542 --> 26:51.333
French cakes.
Financiers.

26:51.417 --> 26:54.125
Got more butter than flour.
Can you imagine?

26:54.208 --> 26:56.542
Molly, for the shops
by the docks,

26:56.625 --> 26:58.291
when you're done.

26:58.375 --> 27:01.083
Here. Gert says
they're out of place.

27:01.166 --> 27:02.834
I guess she's got a point.

27:02.917 --> 27:04.834
Little pups among the hounds.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.333
That's incredible.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.834
I mean it, Molly.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.834
-These are--
-Gert, your sign's blocking
half my doorway!

27:10.917 --> 27:12.667
-Gert: Get away with ya!
-You could have a posh tea room.

27:12.750 --> 27:15.500
Thomas: Oi-oi.
That one's a monster.
(laughs)

27:15.583 --> 27:17.166
Someone cock it up, did they?

27:17.250 --> 27:18.375
A tea room?

27:18.458 --> 27:21.000
No, it's just a treat
for when I have a family.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.834
You could have both.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.750
Thomas:
See, you've gotta charge
more for bigger.

27:25.834 --> 27:27.667
The ladies like it bigger.
(clicks tongue)

27:27.750 --> 27:30.208
Ah, yeah.
This one knows what I mean.

27:30.291 --> 27:32.792
Look at her, eh?
Blushing like a maid.

27:35.750 --> 27:39.250
Gert:
We're gonna have more day-olds
tomorrow than I'd like.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.750
Oof.

27:42.166 --> 27:45.041
-Kicking?
-Ooh, like a musical can-can.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.875
-You're gonna tell him yes?
-(register dings)

27:47.959 --> 27:50.041
You'll not get
many offers as good.

27:50.125 --> 27:54.500
-I'm not sure.
-It's Varnum
you're mooning over.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.083
He's not got the money to marry.

27:57.166 --> 28:00.166
-Has he even said
he would if he could?
-(bell jingles)

28:00.250 --> 28:02.291
He's made no kind of promise.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.542
Gert:
I like him the better for that.

28:04.625 --> 28:07.458
You've gotta be thinking
of your future, Molly.

28:07.542 --> 28:12.291
Your real future.
Not the one that's in your head.

28:12.375 --> 28:17.208
Thing is, our Jenny's
coming on 12 this autumn.

28:17.291 --> 28:20.375
And, uh, I can put her on
for no pay.

28:20.458 --> 28:22.792
So it-it's a savings...

28:22.875 --> 28:25.166
I understand. Yes, of course.

28:25.250 --> 28:28.375
I could send her out
to earn instead,
but these factories...

28:28.458 --> 28:30.959
No, of course she'll not
go to a factory.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.333
She has to come here,
work with her mum.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.417
The shops still need
rolls delivered.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.000
(laughs) And I wouldn't send
Jenny 'round by the river.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.333
I'll give you a penny
to carry 'em down.

28:40.417 --> 28:44.166
-Married ladies need
a little pin money.
-Thank you. Yes.

28:45.834 --> 28:51.166
Well, God makes His plans,
so here we are.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.834
â™ª

29:19.709 --> 29:21.583
Ma.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.834
Do you remember Molly?

29:23.917 --> 29:25.917
We're married now.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.083
You look well, Mrs. True.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.542
Thomas:
Well, you bothered to carry it,

29:30.625 --> 29:32.792
so show her the cake.

29:32.875 --> 29:35.083
-I brought you--
-Thomas: Louder.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.709
I brought you wedding cake.

29:43.709 --> 29:46.333
(chokes, coughs)

29:47.500 --> 29:48.834
Thomas:
Nah.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.917
-It's too rich.
-(coughing continues)

30:09.000 --> 30:13.709
â™ª

30:15.917 --> 30:18.834
(distant yelling)

30:18.917 --> 30:21.083
(dog whimpers)

30:27.250 --> 30:31.083
â™ª

30:42.792 --> 30:45.458
You got better a lot
quicker the last time.

30:45.542 --> 30:47.250
I'm fine.

30:49.291 --> 30:52.208
Yeah. (chuckles)
You should charge more.

30:52.291 --> 30:54.875
Since it looks like them rolls
are all you're gonna deliver.

30:54.959 --> 30:56.417
(giggles)

30:57.834 --> 31:00.041
I'm serious.
That's two you've lost.

31:00.125 --> 31:03.792
-If I'm not gonna have
a namesake to take over--
-The next one will take.

31:05.583 --> 31:08.417
-(thunder rumbles)
-(rain pattering)

31:11.917 --> 31:13.458
(groans)

31:28.041 --> 31:30.417
Solicitor:
I'm just so sorry
for the timing.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.083
But with the medical bills,

31:32.166 --> 31:34.875
him being behind on
the payments for the shop,

31:34.959 --> 31:36.250
the flat's his mum's.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.041
So you'll still have a place.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.250
But Thomas' debts
are outstanding,

31:40.333 --> 31:42.667
and you'll need
to find something...

31:47.417 --> 31:51.625
â™ª

31:53.458 --> 31:56.041
-Gert: Just dragging
your heels a bit.
-Good morning, Jenny.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.625
-Morning.
-And here's me
dying to tell you

31:58.709 --> 32:00.750
who I saw in the
high street yesterday.

32:00.834 --> 32:02.166
Varnum Dale.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.750
Varnum.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.625
-I thought he moved away
for the promotion.
-And back for the next.

32:06.709 --> 32:08.792
In charge of the whole office.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.667
But he recognized me.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.083
Can you imagine?

32:12.166 --> 32:13.959
Pulled his carriage over.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.792
Asked after you.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.083
After me?

32:17.166 --> 32:20.959
Invited us all to attend
his housewarming, sweet boy.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.959
'Course his wife's
seven months in,

32:23.041 --> 32:25.583
and a barren woman's bad luck
in an expectant home,

32:25.667 --> 32:28.583
so I just thanked him for you.

32:28.667 --> 32:30.667
That's the man
you should have gone after.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.542
I always said.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.041
(horse whinnies)

32:40.250 --> 32:41.875
Man:
You in a hurry?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.208
-Now you're being rude.
-Leave me be.

32:50.917 --> 32:54.417
There's no real changes.
Probably just wind.

32:55.250 --> 32:58.041
And how are you feeling?

32:58.125 --> 33:01.000
Well enough, thank you.

33:01.083 --> 33:04.750
We had our troubles
with your system, my girl,

33:04.834 --> 33:06.792
but Thomas having passed,

33:06.875 --> 33:09.583
it's a clear mercy
there were no children.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.125
A mercy.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.208
You're very good with her.

33:18.291 --> 33:20.542
She's a dying woman.
I could hardly do less.

33:20.625 --> 33:24.083
(laughs)
Don't write her off
too quickly, my dear.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.125
She'll not rise from that bed,

33:26.208 --> 33:29.208
but she survived an illness
that killed her son.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.208
I know that type.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.792
Cast iron all through.

33:33.875 --> 33:36.083
Bury us all, more'n like.

33:36.166 --> 33:40.125
Well, God makes His plans,
so here we are.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.875
Sometimes it feels like
God made His plans

33:43.959 --> 33:45.917
long before He met us.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.333
I don't need to
charge you this time,

33:49.417 --> 33:51.959
but, well, in the future...

33:58.709 --> 34:03.333
â™ª

34:22.208 --> 34:24.709
(baby crying)

34:28.208 --> 34:32.667
â™ª

35:00.542 --> 35:02.417
(squeaking open)

35:03.458 --> 35:04.875
Came out the drink.

35:04.959 --> 35:07.333
Guys at the dock said
she works for the bakery.

35:07.417 --> 35:09.625
Molly something.

35:09.709 --> 35:11.792
You'll be fine here, Molly.

35:11.875 --> 35:14.959
-(screaming)
-(slashing)

35:15.041 --> 35:17.709
-(grunts)
-(in Stripe's voice):
Yeah, I might not.

35:24.792 --> 35:26.542
Is this a sim?

35:26.625 --> 35:27.959
It's gotta be FreeLife tech

35:28.041 --> 35:30.166
'cause your temporal
sequencing's fucked.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.166
Sarah:
Play with me.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.834
Back you go now, Sarah.

35:33.917 --> 35:36.875
You have been here
enough now to know the rules.

35:36.959 --> 35:38.917
What are the fucking rules?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.667
'Cause this "Christmas Carol"
crap is so specific

35:41.750 --> 35:43.542
to my three-term focus.

35:46.792 --> 35:49.083
Matron:
You will keep a civil tongue
in this house.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.750
You will be meek
and grateful to God

35:50.834 --> 35:53.250
that you have been delivered
from your own sinful act.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.959
And now I know the rules.

35:55.041 --> 35:56.375
-(thwacks)
-Orderly 1: Oi!

35:56.458 --> 35:58.208
-Orderly 2: Hey!
-(grunts)

35:59.166 --> 36:00.750
(inhales sharply)

36:02.750 --> 36:05.000
-(groaning softly)
-(chains clinking)

36:10.041 --> 36:12.000
(exhales)

36:18.375 --> 36:19.959
Hi, Molly.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.166
Sorry about the restraints.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.792
They don't usually do that,

36:24.875 --> 36:26.625
but you made a mess
of the Matron.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.417
I never heard her wail so.
(laughs)

36:30.750 --> 36:34.709
-I'm Sarah.
-Yeah. That's a straight play.

36:34.792 --> 36:37.750
You can just gift
your sacred name,

36:37.834 --> 36:39.417
'cause you're not a sim.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.959
You're from 18-fuckity-12.

36:43.959 --> 36:46.041
You're not mean like the others.

36:46.125 --> 36:49.917
We become friends.
We tell each other secrets.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.250
You know, Sarah,

36:51.333 --> 36:54.875
a friend's the one you trust
to trust you back.

36:55.792 --> 36:57.000
Well...

36:58.667 --> 37:00.417
Yes. (laughs)

37:00.500 --> 37:03.458
My carbonated fuck,
you are gray!

37:03.542 --> 37:05.959
I don't have any secrets.

37:06.041 --> 37:08.750
-I don't have any secrets!
-(chair slides)

37:08.834 --> 37:10.875
(girls shushing)

37:12.000 --> 37:14.959
I'm a Stripe.
I go, and I do.

37:15.041 --> 37:18.166
And no one said "go."
I got no mission.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.291
I should be dead.

37:24.417 --> 37:26.125
Why aren't I dead?

37:28.625 --> 37:30.166
(pants)

37:31.208 --> 37:34.542
Why are my hands so...
tiny?

37:34.625 --> 37:38.125
(breathing shakily)

37:38.208 --> 37:41.750
It's all right, pet. Shh. Shh.

37:41.834 --> 37:44.625
-(Amalia yelps)
-Shh... Shh...

37:44.709 --> 37:46.458
Shh. It's all right.

37:46.542 --> 37:49.458
-Shh.
-(Amalia sobbing)

37:49.542 --> 37:53.208
-It's all right.
-(sobbing continues)

37:56.375 --> 37:59.333
-(crunching)
-Nurse: It's how many,
the last few weeks?

37:59.417 --> 38:01.792
Do you know what?
Some of them seem
fine at first.

38:01.875 --> 38:05.250
Nurse 2:
Fine? Girl comes in
last night soaking wet.

38:05.333 --> 38:08.291
Couldn't dry her off.
Toweled her for an hour.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.000
Had to send her away,

38:10.083 --> 38:12.125
soaking worse than
when she first came...

38:12.208 --> 38:14.667
Fucking PitSid.
I need some pheen.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.291
Sarah:
If you'd been outside,
you wouldn't be making fun.

38:17.375 --> 38:19.500
Mrs. Hundley:
I highly doubt the Lord Himself

38:19.583 --> 38:22.000
-presented to you
as a great light.
-I know what I saw.

38:22.083 --> 38:24.000
You're an unreliable witness,
my dear.

38:24.083 --> 38:25.291
You're in an asylum.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.917
-So are you.
-Sarah: This is different.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.458
He was sh-shaped like
a dragonfly.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.792
And He came all apart like...
snow or sparks.

38:33.875 --> 38:35.583
Mrs. Hundley:
Sparks?

38:35.667 --> 38:37.750
Was there fire?

38:37.834 --> 38:39.834
Or spores...?

38:39.917 --> 38:42.875
He flew over me,
and then they come down,

38:42.959 --> 38:44.959
and then I saw a flash.

38:45.041 --> 38:48.125
Like an explosion,
but with no noise or smoke.

38:48.208 --> 38:49.709
He was just gone.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.291
Someone else will believe me.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.709
I believe you.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.667
I want to know
exactly how it went.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.417
Mrs. Hundley:
A single spark can set
the whole house ablaze.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.542
-Horatio: Mrs. True.
-Mrs. Hundley: An oil lamp can
be hidden under a proper skirt

39:03.625 --> 39:06.250
-for just so long...
-Horatio: Mrs. Amalia True.

39:06.333 --> 39:08.959
-Mrs. Hundley: Mr. Hundley...
-I'm Dr. Cousens.

39:09.041 --> 39:11.375
I'm here for your
physical examination.

39:11.458 --> 39:12.750
Amalia:
Sorry.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.583
It's my name.
I'm not used to--

39:15.667 --> 39:17.583
(passionate moaning)

39:23.166 --> 39:25.041
There's another physician
making the rounds,

39:25.125 --> 39:26.333
if you'd prefer a white doctor.

39:26.417 --> 39:28.834
No! No. That's not--

39:30.041 --> 39:34.041
Yes. Hi, Dr. Cousens,
it's Molly.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.625
Just Molly.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.834
Let's do this.

39:38.917 --> 39:42.125
You seem to have
avoided infection,

39:42.208 --> 39:44.417
despite the Thames'
best efforts.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.834
Believe it or not,
I've been in worse.

39:46.917 --> 39:49.792
-Are you from America?
-South-coast Canada.

39:49.875 --> 39:53.250
Or... Yes. Or no, I'm...

39:53.333 --> 39:55.333
(with British accent):
a baker.

39:55.792 --> 39:57.208
I see.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.959
Are you in any pain?

40:00.041 --> 40:01.875
(in Stripe's voice):
I'm weak.

40:05.583 --> 40:08.208
Has there been anything
about a light

40:08.291 --> 40:12.333
in the sky, from the day
I ended up here?

40:13.208 --> 40:16.375
Someone saw, or in the news?

40:16.458 --> 40:19.583
Is that why you went
in the river?

40:19.667 --> 40:23.917
-A light?
-No, I think it's
why I came out.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.125
Has anyone been, uh... better?

40:28.208 --> 40:29.625
Smart, or...

40:29.709 --> 40:31.583
compassionate, or...

40:31.667 --> 40:32.834
(distant rattling)

40:32.917 --> 40:34.250
You know what? Never mind.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.875
I sound like I belong
in this place.

40:35.959 --> 40:37.792
(distant screaming,
commotion)

40:37.875 --> 40:39.083
-(screams)
-(slashes)

40:39.166 --> 40:40.458
They took my babies!

40:40.542 --> 40:43.125
I have a baby every day
and they take it!

40:43.208 --> 40:45.208
-(slashes)
-(yells)

40:45.291 --> 40:47.959
-(screaming)
-Nurse: You're just
making it worse!

40:48.041 --> 40:51.291
-Back to the cellar for you!
-Aah! No, no, no!

40:51.375 --> 40:53.083
No! (screaming)

40:53.166 --> 40:54.417
I've done this before.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.291
-I can tell.
-No.

40:56.375 --> 40:58.250
No. I...

40:58.333 --> 41:01.166
-(door closes)
-No, I saw it
the day I came here.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.375
I thought it was a sim...

41:03.458 --> 41:05.625
-mptom.
-It's all right.

41:05.709 --> 41:10.542
I'm gonna sew you up.
I just need a nurse to...

41:10.625 --> 41:13.083
(faint whirring)

41:20.959 --> 41:22.417
Please.

41:29.250 --> 41:33.917
(energy humming)

41:40.250 --> 41:42.750
It's a lot to take in.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.959
No. No, no.

41:45.041 --> 41:48.166
Aliens from the future
gave us magic powers.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.583
It was staring me in the face.

41:50.667 --> 41:53.792
Well, you've seen ailments
you can't explain

41:53.875 --> 41:55.208
last few weeks, yeah?

41:55.291 --> 41:57.875
Here in the ward, yes.
But I'm not...

41:57.959 --> 41:59.792
Insane?

42:00.542 --> 42:01.625
A woman.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.583
Well, there's gotta be more.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.333
The spores don't affect
everyone they hit.

42:08.417 --> 42:11.041
I never understood why.

42:11.125 --> 42:15.542
But they don't normally
cause random powers.

42:15.625 --> 42:18.500
There's a pattern I'm missing.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.583
Wish they'd let us
read the papers.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.083
Why are you telling me
all of this?

42:23.166 --> 42:26.000
-I trust you.
-Why?

42:26.083 --> 42:31.083
-Did... did you see
something in--
-No. No. I...

42:31.166 --> 42:33.542
Should I trust you?

42:33.625 --> 42:35.500
Do you think I'm insane?

42:36.625 --> 42:37.834
Maybe.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.125
Maybe your alien was.

42:45.333 --> 42:47.333
They were torturing it.

42:50.333 --> 42:53.208
I don't know if
this is good news.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.500
But you were right.
People are hiding it,

42:57.583 --> 42:59.291
but it's all over.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.125
Amalia:
No one's spored,

43:02.208 --> 43:03.625
empathically enhanced.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.667
There's no one
here to guide us.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.333
To say here's what
needs to change.

43:08.417 --> 43:11.375
Or... What?

43:13.417 --> 43:15.000
-Fuck you.
-No, I'm--

43:15.083 --> 43:18.625
No, I... Fuck you.
I was a mistake.

43:18.709 --> 43:20.792
A mean joke. I'm a Stripe.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.583
I'm not good.

43:22.667 --> 43:25.917
I've got issues you literally
don't have names for yet.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.542
I might be why
the spores were shit.

43:27.625 --> 43:31.208
-You know what's coming.
And you care.
-I did my time!

43:31.291 --> 43:35.667
I spent a lifetime fighting
and it didn't make any...

43:38.792 --> 43:40.959
Why would it put me in this?

43:41.041 --> 43:43.542
Yeah, this doughy little frame.
It's perfect.

43:43.625 --> 43:46.166
I got world-class tits,
but I can't see over a chair.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.625
It's a...

43:48.333 --> 43:50.250
...good frame.

43:51.917 --> 43:53.917
And nobody was using it.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.500
I gotta get out of this place.

44:07.583 --> 44:11.917
Then you might not want
to say "fuck" quite so often.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And give me back my morphine.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.458
Fuck!

44:15.542 --> 44:18.500
Lester says just a few weeks.

44:18.583 --> 44:21.125
I do feel so much better.

44:21.208 --> 44:22.875
I miss his cooking, though.

44:22.959 --> 44:24.917
A man who cooks.

44:25.041 --> 44:28.417
(in British accent):
A man... who cooks.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.709
He said the light might
have been a German balloon.

44:31.792 --> 44:33.542
A zeppelin.

44:33.625 --> 44:37.083
He doesn't know
what's going on about God.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.750
How He's gonna
give us a mission.

44:39.834 --> 44:42.458
(in Stripe's voice):
You didn't say anything,
did you?

44:42.542 --> 44:44.333
About us, or the mission?

44:44.417 --> 44:46.750
You don't have to ask me that.

44:46.834 --> 44:49.542
You're the one I trust
to trust me back.

44:49.625 --> 44:51.125
Dr. Hague:
Ladies!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.875
I'm Dr. Hague.

44:53.959 --> 44:57.041
I've been hearing about you two.
Which one is Amelia?

44:57.125 --> 44:59.875
Amalia. Molly.

44:59.959 --> 45:02.375
Then you must be Sarah.

45:02.458 --> 45:04.041
(laughs softly)

45:04.125 --> 45:06.000
What, uh...

45:06.083 --> 45:08.417
(with British accent):
What have you been hearing?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.083
Well, first of all,

45:10.166 --> 45:14.166
that you two may be among
the-- the Touched.

45:15.750 --> 45:18.583
That's what they're calling
these people who've...

45:18.667 --> 45:21.375
blossomed these
last few months.

45:21.458 --> 45:22.709
"Touched."

45:22.792 --> 45:24.500
They called me that already.

45:25.250 --> 45:28.458
(laughs)

45:28.542 --> 45:30.083
I'll tell you what, Sarah,

45:30.166 --> 45:33.792
I'm looking for someone
to do a special study with

45:33.875 --> 45:35.458
at my facility.

45:35.542 --> 45:39.083
I'd like to spend a minute
with each of you.

45:39.166 --> 45:40.750
One on one.

45:40.834 --> 45:42.375
Can you give me a minute

45:42.458 --> 45:44.417
-with Amel-- Amalia?
-(chuckles)

45:44.500 --> 45:47.667
And then you and I
can have our own little chat?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.375
(footsteps departing)

46:03.583 --> 46:06.875
They tell me that
you can see the future.

46:07.667 --> 46:10.709
No, I... feel it.

46:10.792 --> 46:15.250
Suddenly. Like I'm falling down.

46:15.333 --> 46:19.542
But I'm not.
And then later, I do.

46:21.834 --> 46:24.333
Once, I smelled oat cakes,

46:24.417 --> 46:26.542
and we had them that night.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.208
I don't like to think
about it too much.

46:32.291 --> 46:33.875
It hurts a little.

46:33.959 --> 46:35.709
I wouldn't want to study it.

46:35.792 --> 46:37.792
It's not a volunteer study.

46:39.083 --> 46:41.041
Tell me...

46:41.834 --> 46:43.583
about the lights.

46:45.542 --> 46:47.125
Sorry?

46:47.208 --> 46:50.500
Dr. Hague:
The lights in the sky.

46:50.583 --> 46:52.625
When you were admitted.

46:52.709 --> 46:56.083
I didn't see any lights.
I was...

46:56.166 --> 46:58.500
Well, I fell in the river.

46:58.583 --> 47:01.709
I jumped, I guess.
I don't remember.

47:01.792 --> 47:03.667
(imitates British accent):
I don't remember.

47:03.750 --> 47:07.959
Huh. Can that really be true?

47:08.041 --> 47:11.458
-The Matron said you were
very outspoken about--
-It was Sarah.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.583
She was terribly upset. She...

47:16.667 --> 47:18.834
said she saw God in the sky,

47:18.917 --> 47:20.875
and no one would believe her.

47:20.959 --> 47:25.625
I lied. Because, well,
she wouldn't stop crying, and...

47:25.709 --> 47:27.542
Well, she never let it go,

47:27.625 --> 47:30.625
and I couldn't tell her
that I...

47:32.208 --> 47:35.041
When the weird things happened,

47:35.125 --> 47:38.417
she said it was proof that
there was a "mission"?

47:39.417 --> 47:41.333
Please don't tell Matron
what I did.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.667
I just wanted Sarah to be happy.

47:43.750 --> 47:46.458
To have something to...

47:49.709 --> 47:51.542
She thinks she's getting better.

47:51.625 --> 47:53.208
(clicks tongue)
No.

47:59.417 --> 48:02.000
What's going on?

48:02.083 --> 48:05.542
(in Stripe's voice):
Tell him what you saw.
He's going to help.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.834
â™ª

48:17.917 --> 48:20.625
-(in British accent):
What a to do.
-What a to do.

48:20.709 --> 48:22.208
What a to do.

48:22.291 --> 48:24.834
What a to do to die today.

48:24.917 --> 48:27.959
Amalia:
What a to do to die today.

48:28.041 --> 48:30.041
And sip.

48:31.667 --> 48:33.709
Mmm. Delicious.

48:33.792 --> 48:36.625
-Loud.
-Loud.

48:36.709 --> 48:38.166
That's right, gently.

48:38.250 --> 48:41.542
-Noisy.
-Noisy.

48:42.166 --> 48:43.291
Lovely.

48:43.375 --> 48:48.458
Mrs. Hundley (speaking slowly):
Loud noisy girls...

48:48.542 --> 48:51.792
-Girls...
-Girls...

48:51.875 --> 48:53.834
Mrs. Hundley:
Return to the bowl.

48:53.917 --> 48:56.875
Take your napkin, and dab.

48:56.959 --> 49:00.291
Corners of the mouth,
very lady-like.

49:00.375 --> 49:02.375
And thank your hostess.

49:04.041 --> 49:05.458
Lovely.

49:05.542 --> 49:07.125
-(panting)
-Amalia: Now remember,

49:07.208 --> 49:10.208
this is not what this is for.

49:13.125 --> 49:16.333
â™ª

49:22.000 --> 49:24.750
(grunting)

49:24.834 --> 49:28.083
(panting)

49:30.083 --> 49:33.542
â™ª

49:42.417 --> 49:44.417
(exhales)

49:49.583 --> 49:54.125
â™ª

50:03.458 --> 50:04.875
Amalia?

50:04.959 --> 50:06.959
The board will see you now.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.542
(distant wailing)

50:15.625 --> 50:18.709
Lavinia:
(clears throat)
The review board said

50:18.792 --> 50:20.875
your release hearing
was exemplary.

50:20.959 --> 50:25.041
That you are motivated,
articulate,

50:25.125 --> 50:27.000
that you take care
of the other inmates,

50:27.083 --> 50:30.875
and in terms of the Touched,
you, and I quote,

50:30.959 --> 50:33.333
"practically run the place."

50:33.417 --> 50:35.792
There is also
an impassioned
recommendation

50:35.875 --> 50:38.000
from Dr. Cousens.

50:38.083 --> 50:41.667
Although he is
not a psychiatrist.

50:41.750 --> 50:45.709
-Why are you here, Mrs.--
-Bidlow. Miss.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.458
The voice is good.

50:47.542 --> 50:50.583
No trace of the butcher's
widow to be found.

50:50.667 --> 50:52.542
It's as if it were another life.

50:52.625 --> 50:54.083
They did find
a cache of weapons

50:54.166 --> 50:56.750
under the floorboards
beneath your bed,

50:56.834 --> 50:58.291
during your hearing.

50:58.375 --> 51:00.959
You grab the spoon
after they've set aside
your dishes.

51:01.041 --> 51:03.417
A sharpened spoon,
that's your first step
to freedom.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.166
Unless they find it.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.542
You had every reason
to expect a positive
outcome from the hearing.

51:10.625 --> 51:12.792
I had no reason to expect
a positive outcome.

51:12.875 --> 51:15.542
Because of your "turn"?

51:15.625 --> 51:17.583
Did you see
the coming rejection?

51:17.667 --> 51:20.959
I "practically run the place."
For free.

51:21.041 --> 51:23.625
If you have any head
for numbers, you can do
the lack of maths.

51:23.709 --> 51:25.291
I have an extraordinary
head for numbers.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.667
I also know that people
will often do

51:27.750 --> 51:29.458
everything in their power

51:29.542 --> 51:33.208
to keep from getting
the thing they want.

51:33.291 --> 51:37.542
I suspect you could've been
miles from here months ago.

51:41.917 --> 51:43.709
And where would I go?

51:44.542 --> 51:46.542
That is why I am here.

51:50.291 --> 51:52.291
What do you think?

51:52.375 --> 51:55.750
I think I am starting to like
this body after all.

51:57.375 --> 51:59.166
Oh, the place.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.291
It's dreary as fuck.

52:01.375 --> 52:03.834
And it's definitely filled
with the angry ghosts

52:03.917 --> 52:06.083
-of murdered children.
-Hmm.

52:07.667 --> 52:10.208
Miss Bidlow give you
any new names?

52:10.291 --> 52:11.500
Possible charges?

52:11.583 --> 52:16.083
Some Irish girl.
I think she builds things.

52:16.166 --> 52:20.458
Not Patience,
but something weird.

52:20.542 --> 52:24.166
Sadness O'Religionface.
I don't know.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.959
God, I hope she drinks.

52:28.583 --> 52:30.792
I thought you were
boasting before.

52:30.875 --> 52:34.333
But you might actually be
the worst person for this job.

52:34.417 --> 52:36.125
No, I'm gonna be great.

52:36.208 --> 52:39.542
Gonna bring us all
harmony and peace.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.125
-(yells)
-(loud thud)

52:42.208 --> 52:45.125
(commotion, grunting)

52:45.208 --> 52:47.375
-Annie: Penance said
this was the easy way!
-(yelling)

52:47.458 --> 52:49.208
Augie:
Bertie Blair told me
all the soldiers

52:49.291 --> 52:50.417
would be deployed elsewhere!

52:50.500 --> 52:53.375
Horatio:
Augustus! Leave the drilling!

52:53.458 --> 52:55.583
-(drill powers off)
-True!

52:56.917 --> 52:58.959
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

53:01.583 --> 53:05.083
-(grunts)
-(indistinct shouting)

53:05.834 --> 53:06.917
Aah!

53:07.000 --> 53:08.250
Annie:
They're backing off!

53:08.333 --> 53:10.458
If we can't get down there
you need...

53:10.542 --> 53:12.208
Augie (yelling):
Amalia!

53:12.291 --> 53:14.542
(crumbling)

53:14.625 --> 53:15.875
Amalia!

53:15.959 --> 53:17.959
(coughing)

53:23.417 --> 53:26.000
(panting)

53:30.083 --> 53:31.667
(coughs)

53:36.709 --> 53:38.875
(rocks crumbling)

53:41.417 --> 53:43.583
Horatio!

53:43.667 --> 53:46.333
(breathing heavily)

54:00.250 --> 54:04.834
â™ª

54:32.792 --> 54:38.166
â™ª

54:38.250 --> 54:39.917
(exhales sharply)

54:45.709 --> 54:49.375
All this time, you're still
in the fucking ceiling.

54:58.792 --> 55:00.458
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

55:06.166 --> 55:08.542
(energy humming)

55:30.250 --> 55:32.041
So now what?

55:32.125 --> 55:34.250

I left Penance because
you said, "Find me."

talk to you. Talk to me!

56:29.917 --> 56:31.959

56:33.625 --> 56:35.667

Was it me?

56:57.333 --> 57:00.458
in this body that

Who is this? Who the fuck am I?

57:09.125 --> 57:11.041
You should have brought Knitter.

She believed.

57:14.083 --> 57:16.250
And I took that from her.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.333
She died in despair. My despair.

And by way of recompense...

59:06.959 --> 59:08.792

with a jarring image
of a spaceship in outer space

of her professional career

for what she's hoped has been
the right side of history.

1:07:46.792 --> 1:07:50.458
And so, there's this real,
inherent tension in Stripe,

1:07:50.875 --> 1:07:56.375

sort of fateful point

1:07:56.458 --> 1:07:58.208

Stripe's team, the PDC,
are there to try and protect
the Galanthi,

1:08:04.417 --> 1:08:07.750

in the process over the years

1:08:07.834 --> 1:08:09.000

all forgotten

what's at stake.

to communicate with us,

a particularly difficult species

the alien-esque qualities

where, like, light can
translucently pass through it.

1:09:16.792 --> 1:09:23.000
The T. Rex part was to give him
an assertive attitude as well.

towards the end of the chapter

1:09:32.792 --> 1:09:35.000
that, in fact,
this particular Galanthi

1:09:35.083 --> 1:09:37.208

1:10:56.667 --> 1:11:01.041
about these three iterations
of who we know as Amalia's soul.

1:11:01.792 --> 1:11:05.625
You know, we-- we try so hard
when we're traumatized to adapt,

1:11:05.709 --> 1:11:08.208
but so much of it becomes
our identity.

1:11:08.291 --> 1:11:10.208
â™ª (MUSIC CONTINUES) â™ª

1:11:10.291 --> 1:11:13.333
CLAUDIA: And, you know,
Molly has such a--

1:11:13.417 --> 1:11:15.500
a tragic experience
in her lifetime

1:11:15.583 --> 1:11:17.125
and has such limited choices

1:11:17.208 --> 1:11:21.166
that she takes the same road
that Stripe does and,

1:11:21.250 --> 1:11:23.625
in these
extraordinary moments,

1:11:23.709 --> 1:11:28.166
you know, timing-wise,
ends up being saved

1:11:28.250 --> 1:11:31.583
just as the Galanthi are--
are making their appearance.

1:11:32.125 --> 1:11:35.667
And it is who
we come to know as Amalia

1:11:35.750 --> 1:11:39.792
who is dragged out of the river
and brought to the asylum.

1:11:40.125 --> 1:11:41.291
(SNIFFS)

1:11:42.750 --> 1:11:43.959
(SIGHS)

1:11:44.583 --> 1:11:45.750
Hi, Molly.

1:11:46.625 --> 1:11:49.500
AMY MANSON: I had such fun
with Sarah. I really did.

1:11:49.583 --> 1:11:52.250
CAMERA ASSISTANT:
Forty-nine, Charlie, take three,
A and B marker. (CLICKS)

1:11:54.083 --> 1:11:57.000
It was so lovely for us, like,
to-- to be able to kind of...

1:11:57.083 --> 1:11:58.208
have fun. (CHUCKLES)

1:11:58.291 --> 1:11:59.917
Because all-- all the scenes
pre-that, you know,

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000
the Maladie and Amalia,
are so weighted

1:12:02.083 --> 1:12:04.208
with so much backstory,
and the backstory's there.

1:12:04.291 --> 1:12:05.458
It's like
we'd done all the work,

1:12:05.542 --> 1:12:07.750
and we were able
to sit in it and enjoy it.

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:10.542
You're the one I trust
to trust me back.

1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:14.709
That was also quite
refreshing... (LAUGHS)
...and enjoyable.

1:12:15.041 --> 1:12:18.125
Can you give me a minute
with Amel-- Amalia?

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:21.458
-(LAUGHS)
-And then, you and I can have
our own little chat.

DENIS O'HARE: What I love
about  The Nevers

1:12:27.625 --> 1:12:31.709
is that every character
has their own agenda.

1:12:31.792 --> 1:12:33.875
And those agendas might overlap,

1:12:33.959 --> 1:12:36.583
and they might, uh, align
for a while.

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:38.834
What's going on?

1:12:40.250 --> 1:12:41.667
Tell him what you saw.

1:12:42.375 --> 1:12:43.625
It's going to help.

1:12:43.834 --> 1:12:44.917
(BREATH WAVERS)

1:12:45.125 --> 1:12:49.250
DENIS: And so, Amalia's needs
and mission at that point

1:12:49.750 --> 1:12:52.792
necessitated her
betraying Sarah.

1:12:53.083 --> 1:12:57.041
So, Amalia is somebody
we ultimately root for

1:12:57.125 --> 1:13:00.875
because we see her flaws,
and we see her struggles, and--

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:02.291
It's-- She's not
a happy character.

1:13:02.375 --> 1:13:04.166
She's not a character
who's at peace with herself.

1:13:04.250 --> 1:13:05.917
She's a tortured character.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000
And I think that is fascinating.

â™ª (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING) â™ª

1:13:13.709 --> 1:13:17.166
JANE: We have
a wonderfully flawed heroine
in Amalia,

1:13:17.250 --> 1:13:20.417
and letting her be flawed
is one of the things, I think,

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:23.583
that makes the show
so powerful and so innovative

1:13:23.667 --> 1:13:24.709
and so unusual.

1:13:24.792 --> 1:13:26.375
You said you were my friend!

1:13:27.041 --> 1:13:29.417
I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice.

1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:30.500
(FLAMES CRACKLING)

1:13:30.583 --> 1:13:32.291
JANE:
We've had a lot of anti-heroes.

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:33.625
We've had a lot
of really flawed heroes,

1:13:33.709 --> 1:13:35.667
a lot of heroes who are dealing
with trauma.

1:13:35.750 --> 1:13:40.125
But they often aren't dealing
with the really unattractive
aspects of trauma,

1:13:40.208 --> 1:13:42.041
and we let Amalia go there
at times.

1:13:42.125 --> 1:13:43.125
(SOBBING)

1:13:43.208 --> 1:13:44.208
I'm not good!

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:47.250
I've got issues you literally
don't have names for yet!

1:13:47.333 --> 1:13:48.959
You know what's coming,
and you care.

1:13:49.041 --> 1:13:50.166
I did my time!

1:13:50.250 --> 1:13:52.417
And I think
that's really important.

1:13:53.375 --> 1:13:56.583
LAURA: As these first
six episodes go through,

1:13:56.667 --> 1:14:01.208
I think she is learning
what she's supposed to be doing

1:14:01.291 --> 1:14:04.000
with this mission
that she figures
she's been given,

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:06.709
but she really is quite lost,
I think.

1:14:07.625 --> 1:14:11.917
At the same time, she knows
enough to know that, um,

1:14:12.333 --> 1:14:15.625
that the Galanthi is where her--
her hope should lie as well.

1:14:15.709 --> 1:14:16.875
(SINGING)

1:14:16.959 --> 1:14:19.417
LAURA: The thing
that really sets that in motion,

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:22.667
first of all, of course, is--
is hearing Mary's song.

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:24.417
And then, the next thing
that happens is

1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.917
that she's able to find out
what Mary's song meant,

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.792
which is a message
from the Galanthi.

1:14:28.875 --> 1:14:32.333
And in that moment,
she decides to go and try

1:14:32.417 --> 1:14:35.709
and find the Galanthi to find
out what she needs to know next.

1:14:35.917 --> 1:14:37.125
Talk to me!

1:14:38.917 --> 1:14:40.583
Why did it go so wrong?

LAURA: What we're just seeing

1:14:43.875 --> 1:14:45.750
by the time we get
to episode six

1:14:45.834 --> 1:14:48.834
is the end of the beginning
for Amalia.

1:14:48.917 --> 1:14:50.542
And everything
that she does from here

1:14:50.625 --> 1:14:54.083
is kind of where
she's been supposed to be.

1:14:54.417 --> 1:14:58.041
My name is Zephyr Alexis Navine.

Well,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1:15:01.542 --> 1:15:03.291
LAURA:
She knows enough, I think,

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:08.667
to be able to move forward
and to accept, I think,

1:15:08.750 --> 1:15:11.375
to a degree where she is now
in her own story,

1:15:11.458 --> 1:15:14.667
where she is in this world
that's she found herself.

1:15:15.625 --> 1:15:17.250
She certainly doesn't have
all of the answers.

1:15:17.333 --> 1:15:20.792
She's got a few more answers
than she had before. (LAUGHS)
