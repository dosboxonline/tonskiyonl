WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.215
[Peter] Rose!

00:08.216 --> 00:09.634
Find out who pulled her protection?

00:09.634 --> 00:11.594
Hawkins called off
her Secret Service detail.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.597
[Peter] Hawkins used to be
Emma and Henry Campbell's old FBI handler?

00:14.597 --> 00:17.517
Somebody killed
the deputy director of the FBI?

00:18.184 --> 00:19.978
[ominous music playing]

00:19.978 --> 00:22.230
- I'm pulling Ramirez.
- I'll need to swap some shifts--

00:22.230 --> 00:24.065
No. I'm sending a replacement. Erik Monks.

00:24.065 --> 00:27.736
[Chelsea] How'd a guy who saved POTUS
get stuck on the VP's daughter's detail?

00:27.736 --> 00:30.447
I guess this is their way
of easing an old man back in.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.823
[Maddie] Let go!

00:32.782 --> 00:34.451
- What the hell was that?
- I slipped.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
I don't care
how many presidents you saved,

00:36.161 --> 00:37.996
I don't do fuckups on this team.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.248
- [Erik] Can I help you find something?
- [Chelsea] Pills.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.834
I know you're an addict,
I know they forced you into rehab,

00:42.834 --> 00:45.670
and I know that if you were anyone other
than the boss's old partner,

00:45.670 --> 00:47.630
they'd never have put your ass
back on a detail.

00:47.630 --> 00:51.468
It is also true that I am clean now.
I get tested twice a week to prove it.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.053
What do you like most?

00:54.804 --> 00:56.306
No one can find out about this.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.516
I can ditch the agents.
I've done it before.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.022
[cell phone chiming]

01:08.193 --> 01:11.237
I heard my aunt say there's someone
in the White House who can't be trusted.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.156
- When is this all gonna be over?
- Soon.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.199
Mr. Vice President.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.700
- Is she in there?
- Yes, sir.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.410
[Redfield] Hey, sweetie.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.996
Some woman sitting in that café
for five hours,

01:19.996 --> 01:22.165
staring out the window
and talking to herself.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.459
- She's Secret Service.
- How could you be so sure?

01:24.459 --> 01:25.627
[Peter] 'Cause I know her.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.378
Rose, this isn't
a terrorist attack anymore,

01:27.378 --> 01:29.172
this is an assassination attempt.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.215
[music fades]

01:31.800 --> 01:33.468
[ominous music playing]

01:40.600 --> 01:43.019
[Ben] The United States Secret Service

01:43.019 --> 01:46.564
is our nation's
premiere law enforcement agency.

01:47.315 --> 01:51.152
We are the best protective agency
that there has ever been.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.031
We have a zero-fail mission to uphold,

01:55.532 --> 01:59.327
which means that we expect
nothing short of perfection.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.621
No mistakes.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.791
To make a mistake in the Secret Service

02:04.791 --> 02:08.795
means to change
the entire course of history.

02:09.796 --> 02:14.676
Fortunately, every man and woman
before me here today

02:15.301 --> 02:17.929
has proven that they are
more than up to the task,

02:18.596 --> 02:21.808
and that they are worthy of trust

02:23.226 --> 02:24.310
and confidence.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.603
[footsteps approaching]

02:25.603 --> 02:28.273
[Ben] It is with great pride
that I welcome

02:28.982 --> 02:32.443
the future
of the United States Secret Service.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.237
Congratulations, agents.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.615
Now please stand
as I administer your oath.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.867
[crowd cheering]

02:38.867 --> 02:39.951
[Ben] Great job.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.745
[camera shutters clicking]

02:42.745 --> 02:45.248
- [indistinct chatter]
- [piano music playing]

02:45.248 --> 02:48.042
You could have at least
texted me you were coming.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.377
And miss that look on your face?

02:49.377 --> 02:51.921
I was only able
to get out of work last minute.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.673
And your father tried too, but--

02:56.301 --> 02:58.386
Go on, say what you're thinking.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.180
I didn't think you were gonna show at all.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.515
Not after how our last conversation ended.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.851
I know you don't believe in all this.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.354
Why would I want my daughter
risking her life

03:08.354 --> 03:10.899
for a country
that doesn't give a damn about her?

03:10.899 --> 03:12.192
I don't see it that way.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.568
I know you don't.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.198
But I don't have to believe in this
to believe in you.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.994
And if there's anybody stubborn enough
to change this world for the better,

03:22.994 --> 03:25.079
it's gonna be my daughter.

03:26.915 --> 03:31.044
Just promise me
you won't wear this suit to Thanksgiving,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.671
looking like
you're about to hand out warrants.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.881
[both chuckling]

03:34.881 --> 03:35.840
Mom.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.968
What? You're gonna give
Aunt Deborah a heart attack.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.470
[both chuckling]

03:40.470 --> 03:41.429
Duly noted.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.183
I'm really glad you came.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.772
[woman] I'm so proud of you,

03:51.481 --> 03:53.191
and so is your father.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.954
They are lucky to have you.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.498
I hope they realize that.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.793
They will.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.088
[opening theme music playing]

04:15.088 --> 04:18.341
[Maddie] <i>It's an opportunity to study
the masters where they did their art.</i>

04:18.341 --> 04:20.885
[Redfield] Under no circumstances
are you gallivanting to Italy

04:20.885 --> 04:22.637
instead of focusing on your education.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.014
[Maddie] But missing class
to go to political rallies

04:25.014 --> 04:27.392
so I can be a cardboard cutout,
that's okay?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.478
It's one semester.
The whole point of it is education.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.648
It's a semester of just art,
not real education.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.316
It's elitist, entitled.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.693
Maddie, it's a bad look.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.404
You need to think about
how your decisions reflect on your family.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.446
You mean you?

04:41.906 --> 04:43.324
You'll get a schedule next week.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.618
Maddie will be traveling with me
back to Wisconsin

04:45.618 --> 04:47.161
to stump for Turner's campaign.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.162
Yes, sir.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.749
- [man] Hey, there he is!
- [crowd clamoring]

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
[man 2] Can I get a picture?

04:53.167 --> 04:56.004
Hey. Hi. It's all right.
Let him go. Let him pass.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.213
Maddie, come here.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.048
[man] VP Redfield, huge fan, sir.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.884
Who's up first?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.140
[camera shutter clicking]

05:07.140 --> 05:08.057
Thank you.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.851
[woman] I can't believe he's here!

05:13.646 --> 05:14.814
[door closing]

05:14.814 --> 05:16.107
[Chelsea] Anything I can do?

05:16.107 --> 05:17.150
No.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.444
Maybe we can come up with an excuse.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.779
Exams or something.
Say you can't miss the days.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.448
No, I'll go.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.576
Like always.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.372
I don't know how you do it.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.166
Which part?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.296
The... the smiles, the hugs.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.340
It's always hard for the first second.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.135
Then it warms me up.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.138
I... like, fall into it.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.807
Like you're performing?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.894
No, it becomes real to me.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.651
This sounds crazy, but...

06:04.155 --> 06:05.406
I like the lie.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.286
[somber music playing]

06:10.286 --> 06:12.330
It's who I wish he was all the time.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.671
[man] <i>Arrington, there's an FBI agent
from the White House to speak with you.</i>

06:20.671 --> 06:21.631
What about?

06:22.173 --> 06:23.800
[man] <i>Says he can only speak with you.</i>

06:24.842 --> 06:25.968
Okay, stand by.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.554
Sorry, I should check this out.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.515
It's fine.
I have to get ready for class anyway.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.767
I'll catch up in 20. Jeff's in the hall.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.228
[tense music playing]

06:36.938 --> 06:38.231
[indistinct chatter]

06:39.982 --> 06:41.150
[Peter] Agent Arrington.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.027
Uh, thanks for taking
the time to talk with us.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.612
Of course. Peter, right?

06:44.612 --> 06:47.407
Yeah. Uh, we played basketball
with POTUS a few months back.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.158
You're the one who set a hard pick on her.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.453
Yeah, I thought that you were gonna
cuff me right there. [chuckling]

06:53.454 --> 06:55.498
Look, is there someplace we can, uh, talk?

06:56.874 --> 06:59.919
Uh, gotta be back in ten minutes,
but we can take a walk.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.837
[Peter] Great.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.217
I'm working an investigation right now,

07:06.217 --> 07:08.803
and I was hoping to get
some more info about your detail

07:08.803 --> 07:10.596
on April 27th from last year.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.100
- Date doesn't ring a bell.
- It was the day of the metro bombing.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.228
Can you say who you were protecting?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.646
[Chelsea] To an FBI agent? No.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.356
Not without an official request.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.858
Was it Maddie Redfield?

07:22.733 --> 07:24.318
- And who are you again?
- [Rose] I'm Rose.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.113
Not FBI or a basketball player.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.906
We're on special assignment
from Diane Farr.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.575
If you need to call to verify, you can.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.034
We have reason to believe

07:32.034 --> 07:34.120
that if it was Maddie
you were protecting that day,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.496
she could be in danger.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.914
Okay, what kind of danger?

07:36.914 --> 07:38.916
We don't have specifics right now.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.461
[Rose] We think someone
might've tried to kill her that night.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.839
If you could tell us if she was there,
we could help you.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.216
I can't disclose information
about Secret Service operations

07:47.216 --> 07:49.177
to another agency, let alone a civilian.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.846
But you already know that.
So does the chief of staff.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.681
I know that it's strange, okay? But--

07:53.681 --> 07:56.309
Do you also get
that I have to report this conversation?

07:56.934 --> 07:57.768
Yeah.

07:58.769 --> 07:59.937
Let me run it up the chain.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.190
If I get clearance
to share anything, I will.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.149
Thank you.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.109
Let me, uh, give you my number.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.613
In the meantime, I can assure you
Maddie's safe under our protection.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.656
That's what they said
right before some assassins

08:10.656 --> 08:13.284
chased me out of my hotel room
in nothing but a bathrobe.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.204
Never mind.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.248
- Could you point us toward the library?
- [Chelsea] Sure.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.541
Just take a left there,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.085
you'll pass a few dorms,
and it'll be right in front of you.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.253
Thank you.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.963
- Have a good day.
- [Rose] Thanks.

08:27.381 --> 08:30.009
- The library?
- Yeah, I think better in libraries.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.471
I started going to libraries
when it sucked at home,

08:33.471 --> 08:36.474
and after a while it was
more about escaping to a place

08:36.474 --> 08:37.975
than escaping from a place.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.854
I thought I could read my way to Stanford.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.940
- Shit, you went to Stanford?
- No.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.484
Those bastards rejected me.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.112
I went to a community college,
then transferred to Berkeley.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.784
When I started my company, I hired a bunch
of Stanford grads to grab me coffee.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.119
Miss being in charge?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.580
Who says I'm not in charge now?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.001
If Agent Arrington
can confirm who the target was,

09:04.001 --> 09:06.963
I think we're one step closer
to figuring all this out.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.840
Then let's assume
that it was Maddie Redfield.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.758
Yeah.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.051
Someone in the White House

09:12.051 --> 09:14.929
was willing to take out
an entire neighborhood just to get to her.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.641
Nothing on that drive
tells us why, or who's responsible.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.020
So either way, we've gotta
start looking at this from another angle.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.649
Maybe now that we've seen
the killer's face,

09:27.149 --> 09:28.943
we can figure out a way to ID him.

09:28.943 --> 09:29.860
How?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.281
That picture I pulled? The killer's ring?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.908
The FBI determined it was Yugoslavian,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.536
but that's where the trail ended, so...

09:39.453 --> 09:40.663
Maybe we missed something.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.957
We can go back, do some research,
find a connection?

09:42.957 --> 09:45.543
If only there was,
like, a place full of books

09:45.543 --> 09:47.545
that was just perfect for doing research.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.549
Oh, wait, what's this?

09:52.341 --> 09:54.176
[dramatic music playing]

09:55.636 --> 09:57.221
He mentioned Diane Farr by name?

09:57.221 --> 09:59.557
Yes, sir. Some special assignment.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.851
[sighing] All right.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.022
Just tell him Maddie's not involved.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.691
Get her name out of it,
but not a word more.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.734
[Chelsea] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:13.321
- Tell me what you want.
- [Ben] We need to talk.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.864
[Diane] I have to call you back.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.036
[sighing] What's wrong, Ben?
You appear vexed.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.456
Why is your answering machine
running around questioning my agents?

10:23.456 --> 10:24.790
What are you talking about?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.542
Sutherland interrogated my agent,

10:26.542 --> 10:28.628
asking where
Maddie Redfield was last year.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.046
- Why?
- [Ben] You tell me.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.089
Says he's on a special assignment for you.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.758
I've got no clue why he's at Georgetown.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.302
- That's not what it sounds like.
- What does it sound like?

10:36.302 --> 10:38.346
Like you're running
an off-the-books investigation,

10:38.346 --> 10:41.223
and quite honestly,
that makes me really uncomfortable.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.310
Well, come over here
and let me rub circles on your back.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.853
After that, you can fuck off.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.772
This is POTUS's purview, not yours.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.442
If you have a lead,
you need to share it with the rest of us.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.027
[Diane] The rest of who, Ben?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.572
Last time I checked,
Secret Service was compromised,

10:56.572 --> 10:59.241
the deputy director of the FBI was dead.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.037
It was your guys
who deserted Rose Larkin at her hotel.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.666
And it's a little convenient
that you've just started to pay attention.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.250
Fuck you, convenient.

11:09.168 --> 11:13.089
I asked Peter to find out anything
about this ongoing clusterfuck.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.758
And unless there's something
you don't want him to discover,

11:15.758 --> 11:17.259
I don't see how it's your business.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.928
Sutherland just made it my business

11:18.928 --> 11:21.764
when he suggested
someone might be out to hurt Maddie,

11:21.764 --> 11:24.725
without providing any justification
beyond your name.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.936
POTUS and VP are en route,

11:26.936 --> 11:30.940
and trust me, they're gonna wanna know
where Sutherland got this idea from.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.193
So if I were you,
I'd come up with an explanation...

11:35.111 --> 11:35.945
quickly.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.950
[tense music playing]

11:45.329 --> 11:47.331
[phone keypad beeping]

11:50.960 --> 11:54.588
[operator] <i>We're sorry, the number
you've dialed is no longer in service.</i>

11:55.089 --> 11:57.758
[Peter] Closest thing they found
to match the ring is the coat of arms

11:57.758 --> 11:59.176
from the kingdom of Yugoslavia,

11:59.176 --> 12:01.637
which hasn't existed since World War II.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.640
A ring which, for all we know,
he could've gotten at a pawn shop.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.434
Yeah, but look closer.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.229
[Rose] It's not an exact match.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.856
[Peter] Yeah, came back inconclusive.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.858
Something else that's been bothering me.

12:13.858 --> 12:17.653
When everyone thought the bomber was PIF,
it became a military op.

12:17.653 --> 12:21.323
FBI stopped looking into suspects,
case closed, it's over.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.117
- And whose call was that?
<i>-</i> Hawkins.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.454
[Rose] Is there a way that we can retrace
his steps back to the White House?

12:26.454 --> 12:27.913
Get on his computer or something?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.707
I don't think
I could get that close to it.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.292
[Rose sighing]

12:32.376 --> 12:35.212
But he has a widow.
We could try talking to her.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.339
Okay. You go do that.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.884
- I'll see what I can dig up on this ring.
- No, no, no.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.594
We stay together, okay?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.346
Peter, this is a library.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.682
The worst thing that happens here
are late fees.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.517
There's people, cameras...

12:49.393 --> 12:51.520
I'll be fine for, like, a couple of hours.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.398
Rose, please, can you do this stuff later?

12:54.398 --> 12:55.649
Come with me first, and then--

12:55.649 --> 12:58.444
This isn't about protection.
This is about time management.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.404
Time that we're running out of.

13:02.698 --> 13:03.657
Shit. All right, fine.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.497
Giving you the number to my new burner.
I still have yours, so...

13:11.165 --> 13:12.041
Call me.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.251
And not just for emergencies, okay?

13:14.251 --> 13:15.419
- To, uh--
- To chitchat?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.213
No. You know what I mean.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.839
To... to gossip? To giggle?

13:18.839 --> 13:21.425
No. So I know you're okay.
Just check in with me.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.803
And call me
if someone tries shooting at you.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.221
I've... I've got some tips.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.180
- [Peter] Really?
- Yeah.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.015
Did you pick those up at, uh, Stanford?

13:28.015 --> 13:30.184
Oh, fuck Stanford. They didn't deserve me.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.143
Ooh.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.313
[cell phone vibrating]

13:34.897 --> 13:35.731
[Peter] Hello?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.608
- [Chelsea] <i>Agent Sutherland?</i>
- Yeah, speaking.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.110
I've been cleared to tell you
I wasn't with Maddie that day

13:40.110 --> 13:42.530
and that what you're looking into
has nothing to do with her.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.241
There anything you can tell me
about who you were protecting?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.159
[Chelsea] <i>That's all
I've been cleared to share.</i>

13:47.159 --> 13:49.620
Anything else needs
to go through official channels.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.499
But if you have something else to report
about a threat against my protectee,

13:53.499 --> 13:54.583
now would be the time.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.461
No, if it wasn't her you were with
at the coffee shop, then you're right.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.129
<i>She's got nothing to do with this.</i>

14:00.089 --> 14:01.423
What do you mean "coffee shop"?

14:02.758 --> 14:03.884
You tell me.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.344
I'm hanging up now.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.930
[Peter] <i>Does the name Osprey
mean anything to you?</i>

14:07.930 --> 14:09.431
[tense music playing]

14:11.350 --> 14:12.268
Goodbye.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.357
Great work, everybody.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.110
Uh, enjoy the rest of your day,
and we'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.028
[girl] Thank you, Professor.
See you tomorrow.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.572
[indistinct chatter]

14:38.460 --> 14:40.462
[tense music playing]

14:57.563 --> 14:59.565
How much longer are you on shift?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.984
About four hours. Why?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.486
I need an outfit
for Harper's art show tonight.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.822
Was thinking maybe you could help me
pick something out.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.992
So I take it that means
no American political development class?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.410
After Dad's morning drop-in,

15:11.410 --> 15:14.872
I've had enough American
political development for one day.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.083
I think a little retail therapy
is on the menu instead.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.752
Okay, I'll let the team know.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.215
I have five minutes,
then I'm due in a budget meeting.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.133
What's going on?

15:26.133 --> 15:28.260
Thank you for taking the time,
Madam President.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.555
Uh, earlier today,
FBI agent Peter Sutherland

15:31.555 --> 15:33.724
arrived on the campus
of Georgetown University

15:33.724 --> 15:36.352
accompanied by a civilian, a Rose Larkin.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.521
- Her name may sound familiar--
- I know who Ms. Larkin is.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.106
[man] Wait a minute, Sutherland?

15:41.106 --> 15:42.483
What's he doing in the field

15:42.483 --> 15:44.693
with the key witness
to an FBI investigation?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.196
He claims he's under assignment
from Diane Farr,

15:47.196 --> 15:49.573
investigating a threat
on Maddie Redfield's life.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.993
Care to fucking explain, Diane?

15:52.993 --> 15:56.455
After what happened at the hotel,
and Hawkins's murder,

15:56.455 --> 16:00.292
I put Rose Larkin under the supervision
of the one person I knew I could trust.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.378
[Redfield] It doesn't explain
why he's in Georgetown

16:02.378 --> 16:04.338
sniffing around my daughter.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.839
I don't know why he's there.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.841
He's not picking up my calls.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.469
And here I thought answering the phone
was his only job.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.389
Are you saying he's AWOL?
With the witness?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.933
No. We're limiting communication
out of concern for safety.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.476
I couldn't risk anyone tracking them.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.894
[Ben] This is a mess.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.940
Would you like Secret Service to apprehend
Agent Sutherland at Georgetown?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.942
- [Diane] That's a little extreme.
- Is Maddie safe?

16:24.942 --> 16:27.820
[Ben] Yes, she is.
And from what we could tell so far,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.948
Maddie has absolutely nothing
to do with whatever investigation

16:30.948 --> 16:33.867
Sutherland is conducting
on Diane Farr's behalf.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.828
But I'd prefer to ask him that myself.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.079
As would I.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.914
[Diane] Peter's loyal. He'll report in.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.499
I'll have an answer by end of day.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.751
- Madam President, I don't think--
- Give us the room.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.296
Now.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.050
[tense music playing]

16:59.309 --> 17:00.394
[Michelle] All right.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.938
What's really going on?

17:02.938 --> 17:05.149
- He's onto something.
- And you know this how?

17:05.149 --> 17:07.943
He and Ms. Larkin are picking up
where the Campbell's left off.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.154
They're trying to finish
the Night Action investigation.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.905
And that led them to Maddie Redfield?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.032
- [Diane] Mm-hmm.
- How?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.033
I don't know.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.661
Not good enough.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.247
- Their lives are in danger.
- [Diane sighing]

17:21.415 --> 17:22.958
Get them back here before it's too late.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.209
Understood.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.009
[knocking on door]

17:33.761 --> 17:34.720
[Peter] Mrs. Hawkins.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.847
My name is Peter Sutherland.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.807
I... I worked with your husband.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.436
I'm so sorry for your loss.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.189
That's the obligatory thing to say,
isn't it?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.776
I... I was just hoping
I could ask you a few questions

17:48.776 --> 17:51.028
about something
your husband and I were, uh,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.615
we were looking into it
before he... he died.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.993
[birds chirping]

18:00.204 --> 18:01.038
Thank you.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.589
You were in the FBI too?

18:10.589 --> 18:11.965
[woman] That's where we met.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.550
Is that what you came here to ask?

18:14.384 --> 18:17.137
No. Deputy Director Hawkins and I

18:17.137 --> 18:20.641
were part of a group
that was investigating the metro bombing--

18:20.641 --> 18:23.811
Look, I already told those other guys,
I don't know anything.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.814
Jamie wasn't allowed
to talk about his work with me.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.817
I left the FBI 20 years ago.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.945
I tried doing it with kids,
and it just didn't feel right.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.240
I understand. Maybe you heard something,
didn't really seem important.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.534
Or maybe he left something here
that I could look at.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.119
What do you think happens

18:40.119 --> 18:43.122
when a deputy FBI director's murdered,
and nobody knows why?

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
Let me show you something.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.425
For two days, the bureau grilled me.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.344
Cleared out our house.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.055
They already went through
all of his files,

19:00.055 --> 19:02.307
his desk, his books,

19:02.307 --> 19:03.684
his computer,

19:03.684 --> 19:04.643
and mine.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.229
Go ahead.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.111
Thirty years of service,

19:14.111 --> 19:16.071
they treat him like a criminal.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.448
Yeah. I know how you feel.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.325
You couldn't possibly.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.827
[desk drawer closing]

19:23.620 --> 19:24.705
I actually do.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.833
The FBI raided my house when I was 16

19:27.833 --> 19:31.545
because they suspected
my, um, my father of something.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.547
So I get how easy it is

19:33.547 --> 19:36.341
to feel like all this
will just go away in a few days.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.554
What about in a few weeks,
or a few months,

19:40.554 --> 19:43.056
when everybody
is telling you he's guilty, still?

19:43.056 --> 19:46.101
I'm not interested in other people's
opinions of my husband.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.437
I know him.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.480
Yeah, just like I knew my father.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.358
Right? And then a few years go by.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.360
Five years,

19:55.944 --> 19:56.820
six,

19:57.821 --> 19:58.697
seven.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.699
And no more answers.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.242
Just more questions.

20:02.242 --> 20:06.413
Like why is everybody so certain
that he's guilty, when I know him?

20:08.248 --> 20:09.124
Yeah.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.584
[zipping bag]

20:12.211 --> 20:14.504
It, uh, gets to the point that...

20:18.759 --> 20:20.135
enough time has passed,

20:20.928 --> 20:21.845
and you, uh...

20:23.931 --> 20:25.474
you start asking yourself...

20:26.850 --> 20:28.310
you know, you start thinking...

20:31.104 --> 20:32.356
"What if they are right?"

20:34.066 --> 20:34.942
You know?

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
Suddenly, it's not so easy anymore,

20:41.114 --> 20:44.660
defending the... the memory
of someone who's gone.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.538
Because the truth is...

20:51.541 --> 20:52.376
you're just--

20:53.085 --> 20:55.462
Year after year, you're asking yourself,

20:56.338 --> 20:57.839
"What the fuck happened, man?"

21:01.593 --> 21:04.012
Look, I don't wanna see that happen
to someone else.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.306
Sutherland.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.727
- I thought when I heard your name--
- Yeah.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.232
I'm sorry you had to grow up with that.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.693
Look...

21:19.194 --> 21:20.570
your husband might be guilty.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.198
He may have gotten murdered
by one of his own accomplices.

21:23.198 --> 21:26.785
Or maybe he got so close to the truth
that that's what got him killed.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.245
[dramatic music playing]

21:28.245 --> 21:30.831
But I just know
if those questions aren't answered...

21:31.957 --> 21:33.750
it gets so much worse.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.422
[indistinct chatter]

21:40.173 --> 21:41.258
[lights powering on]

21:47.639 --> 21:49.224
Of course it's a dungeon.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.769
[lights powering on]

22:03.322 --> 22:04.364
[lights powering on]

22:19.755 --> 22:20.881
[lights powering down]

22:20.881 --> 22:21.840
[Rose gasping]

22:21.840 --> 22:23.925
[ominous music playing]

22:37.773 --> 22:38.774
[door opening]

22:41.568 --> 22:43.945
[door creaking, closing]

22:59.795 --> 23:01.296
[suspenseful music swelling]

23:03.382 --> 23:04.966
- [music fading]
- [girl giggling]

23:08.095 --> 23:09.137
[Rose sighing]

23:10.597 --> 23:12.015
[books shuffling]

23:13.975 --> 23:16.311
If you worked with Jamie
in the White House,

23:16.311 --> 23:19.731
then you should know more about
what he was involved with than me.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.690
Thank you.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.568
Who was my husband to you?

23:24.820 --> 23:25.695
Um...

23:28.073 --> 23:29.908
Look, I'm sorry. I lied earlier.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.326
I did work with your husband.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.537
I just don't think he liked me very much.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.165
Probably had something to do with him
thinking my father was a traitor

23:37.165 --> 23:38.333
that got what he deserved.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.963
It doesn't means he doesn't deserve
the chance to be proven innocent, okay?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.297
And what's in this for you?

23:44.297 --> 23:46.174
[Peter] The person I'm protecting
is in danger.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.761
Whatever your husband was looking into,
it has something to do with it.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.763
All I want is to keep her safe though.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.858
[sighing]

24:05.485 --> 24:07.446
I lied earlier as well.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.072
[tense music playing]

24:28.467 --> 24:30.427
[keyboard clacking]

24:38.602 --> 24:40.937
Jamie did talk to me about his cases.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.690
He ran ideas past me all the time,

24:43.690 --> 24:46.359
valued my opinion.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.572
And he was working
on the metro bombing case for a while.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.828
There was some inconsistency
he picked up on.

24:56.828 --> 24:57.746
What kind?

24:57.746 --> 25:01.166
He thought someone interfered
with the FBI's investigation.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.503
The pieces they were left with
didn't add up.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.214
You're talking about Omar Zadar
and the People's Independence Front?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.007
He said that was all bullshit.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.636
That confession came
practically out of thin air.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.305
The bureau already had a list of suspects,

25:15.305 --> 25:17.516
none connected to Zadar.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.269
So Jamie went back
through some case files,

25:21.269 --> 25:23.772
and I think he found something

25:23.772 --> 25:26.525
that pointed straight
to a government contractor

25:27.317 --> 25:28.985
called Turn Lake Industries.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.489
- Have you heard of them?
- No.

25:32.489 --> 25:37.619
The day that Jamie went missing,
he had a secret meeting with them.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.829
I don't know with who.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.915
It seemed like it was the CEO.

25:42.832 --> 25:46.127
He was just acting kind of nervous.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.213
It's like something got to him.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.589
Did he say anything else?

25:51.925 --> 25:52.759
No.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.721
He just left for work...

26:01.017 --> 26:02.435
and he never came home.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.063
[keyboard clacking]

26:17.075 --> 26:18.451
Holy shit.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.745
You didn't mention this
to any other agents

26:20.745 --> 26:22.080
during the interview process?

26:22.080 --> 26:27.794
No, Jamie didn't know who he could trust.
And it'd have just made him look worse,

26:27.794 --> 26:30.005
that he was sharing things with me.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.924
But that's how we were. We...

26:35.135 --> 26:36.428
we shared everything.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.764
Jamie knew the Campbells.

26:41.516 --> 26:44.811
When he was in counterintelligence,
he was their handler.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.607
Their deaths were personal to him.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.526
He cried that night.

26:53.486 --> 27:00.327
What all of that had to do with Turn Lake
or the metro case, I have no idea...

27:02.829 --> 27:05.081
but I think Jamie was close to knowing.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.167
Thank you.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.461
Okay? For everything.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.381
Just...

27:14.924 --> 27:16.593
make it worth something.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.139
[car horns honking]

27:22.432 --> 27:23.266
[door opening]

27:29.939 --> 27:30.815
What?

27:32.192 --> 27:33.735
She's coming here tonight.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.747
She's really fallen for you, hasn't she?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.041
You really think
she can lose her protection?

27:48.041 --> 27:50.001
She said she's done it before.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.337
[man] Good.

27:55.298 --> 27:56.591
[man 2 sighing heavily]

27:58.218 --> 27:59.594
[man 2 inhaling deeply]

28:02.013 --> 28:02.889
What's wrong?

28:03.390 --> 28:05.934
It feels wrong
to manipulate her like this.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.770
She's a good soul.

28:08.770 --> 28:12.023
[man] If she helps us,
we could change the world.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.943
Those are your words.

28:16.319 --> 28:20.198
You'll convince her,
just like you convinced me.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.283
Hey.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.828
It's for the greater good.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.871
And once she realizes that,

28:26.871 --> 28:29.165
she'll understand
why we had to be discreet,

28:29.958 --> 28:30.917
do it this way.

28:32.335 --> 28:33.461
Smile.

28:34.462 --> 28:37.549
All the months of hard work
are about to pay off.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.010
[ominous music playing]

28:49.686 --> 28:51.688
[door creaking]

28:53.356 --> 28:56.151
Sorry, it needs to be
where I can see you fill it.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.986
The lab's pretty adamant about that.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.948
[Erik chuckling]

29:02.949 --> 29:04.159
Right, my bad.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.625
Would you mind taking a step back?

29:12.625 --> 29:13.752
[man] Right.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.711
Of course.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.802
[urinating in cup]

29:24.387 --> 29:25.346
[pants zipping]

29:25.847 --> 29:27.140
[urinal flushing]

29:34.105 --> 29:35.690
[faucet running]

29:37.942 --> 29:40.028
Always dreamed
of working in the White House.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.364
Thank you for your service.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.824
[door opening]

29:45.492 --> 29:46.493
[knocking on door]

29:46.493 --> 29:48.244
You wanted to see me, boss?

29:50.038 --> 29:51.498
Arrington's report from the bar.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.044
Anything you wanna add to it?

30:00.715 --> 30:03.635
She could have at least left something
to the imagination.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.929
Anything look inaccurate?

30:10.016 --> 30:10.850
No.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.561
No, it's tough but fair.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.604
[Ben smacking lips]

30:14.604 --> 30:17.982
Come on, Erik.
I'm not the only guy who gets that report.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.736
This is where
I'm supposed to chew you out,

30:21.736 --> 30:23.738
and then you say
it's never gonna happen again.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.033
- Can we skip the first part?
- If you're worried about my work--

30:27.033 --> 30:28.785
Fuck off, your work.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.870
I'm worried about you.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.456
I'm good. Just...

30:34.833 --> 30:36.000
[Erik sighing]

30:36.000 --> 30:36.960
...acclimating.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.837
Good.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.590
What's your take on Arrington?

30:45.009 --> 30:45.844
She's young.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.221
- Which makes us?
- She's young, but she's sharp.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.015
She's just got a different way
of doing things.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.685
- Different how?
- [Erik] Like the two of them are friends.

30:53.685 --> 30:58.356
It's not the way I would go about the job,
but maybe it's a generational thing?

30:58.356 --> 30:59.816
You think it's a problem?

30:59.816 --> 31:00.733
No.

31:02.485 --> 31:03.319
Not yet.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.238
[knocking on door]

31:05.238 --> 31:06.906
- [Chelsea] Maddie?
- Come in.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.786
- Is that a shower curtain?
- Return pile?

31:12.412 --> 31:14.914
- [Chelsea grunting]
- I still can't decide what to wear.

31:15.915 --> 31:16.875
[Chelsea] Uh...

31:23.548 --> 31:24.883
Okay, what about this one?

31:25.508 --> 31:28.052
[Maddie] I just wasn't sure
if I could pull it off.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.346
Hold on.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.440
Might there, by chance,
be a guy at this art show

31:40.440 --> 31:41.983
who we're trying to impress?

31:43.776 --> 31:45.904
No idea what you're talking about.

31:45.904 --> 31:46.863
Right.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.615
So, what's his name?

31:49.532 --> 31:50.867
His name is...

31:51.868 --> 31:52.744
Shut up.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.454
[Chelsea chuckling]

31:54.454 --> 31:56.789
All right, fine. Don't tell me.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.709
I'll find out whatever I need to
in his background check anyway.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.337
[sighing] Uh, okay.

32:03.796 --> 32:06.591
- Thoughts?
- [Chelsea] Yeah. It's definitely the one.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.974
Chelsea Arrington,
licensed retail therapist.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.017
[Chelsea chuckling]

32:16.559 --> 32:18.895
I don't have anything
for this neckline though.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.106
I know how to fix that.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.403
It's beautiful.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.282
My grandmother gave it to my mom
when she was a kid.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.161
After she and my dad got married,
they hit a rough patch.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.747
She had to pawn it
to keep a roof over their heads,

32:37.747 --> 32:41.834
so my dad spent the next two years
working double shifts

32:41.834 --> 32:44.879
just so he could save enough
to buy it back for their anniversary.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.757
My mom gave it to me when I was seven,

32:48.758 --> 32:52.553
as a reminder to never give up hope,
'cause things will get better.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.348
[Maddie smacking lips]

32:55.848 --> 32:58.142
There is no way
that I'm borrowing this now.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.852
It's just one night. It's fine.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.398
I don't deserve a friend like you.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.858
You know what else my mom told me?

33:05.858 --> 33:08.361
We deserve whatever we say we deserve.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.446
[contemplative music playing]

33:20.081 --> 33:21.332
[tense music playing]

33:21.916 --> 33:22.875
[Rose whispering] Peter.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.381
- Hey.
- You okay?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.590
[Rose] Yeah.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.427
For a little bit, I... I thought
someone was following me, but--

33:32.427 --> 33:33.428
- Who?
- [Rose] It's fine.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.680
It was just some students making out.

33:36.597 --> 33:39.267
But still, I'm glad you're back.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.310
Um, did you find anything?

33:41.310 --> 33:44.647
Yeah. It turns out Hawkins
knew your aunt and uncle from the FBI.

33:45.148 --> 33:49.110
The way his wife was talking about it
made it sound like they were really close.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.612
I think he got killed
trying to solve their murders.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.948
- So it wasn't him.
- [Peter] I don't think so.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.200
The day he was killed,
he was meeting somebody high up

33:56.200 --> 33:58.995
at a company called, uh,
Turn Lake Industries.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.663
[dramatic music playing]

34:00.663 --> 34:02.081
Well, check this out.

34:06.753 --> 34:07.628
That's him.

34:07.628 --> 34:11.257
No name or anything, but he's a suspect
in a missing person's case.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.302
The missing dude's name is Andrej Pavelić.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.055
He was part of some defunct royal family.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.183
And look at the family crest.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.728
- That's the same as the ring.
- Yeah.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.938
Before Pavelić's disappearance,

34:25.938 --> 34:29.609
he was railing in the press
about an American defense contractor

34:29.609 --> 34:32.528
conducting shadow ops
throughout the Balkans.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.947
And guess who the contractor was?

34:34.947 --> 34:36.407
Turn Lake Industries.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.243
[Rose] Yeah.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.205
So this company was involved
in the murder of my aunt and uncle.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.874
Maybe. See what else
you can find out about Turn Lake.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.334
I gotta check in with Farr.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.419
[Rose exhaling]

34:49.712 --> 34:51.714
[cell phone vibrating]

34:53.424 --> 34:54.967
- This is Farr.
- [Peter] <i>It's Peter.</i>

34:54.967 --> 34:56.636
We found something on one of the killers.

34:56.636 --> 35:00.264
I don't know what the fuck you're doing
harassing Secret Service at Georgetown,

35:00.264 --> 35:01.933
but people are melting down over here.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.143
<i>We thought someone
was trying to hurt the VP's daughter.</i>

35:04.143 --> 35:05.937
It was a dead end anyway.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.190
Still think Secret Service
might have the missing piece to all this.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.817
<i>Also, we just found something else.</i>

35:10.817 --> 35:12.902
You ever heard of Turn Lake Industries?

35:12.902 --> 35:15.446
- The security contractor?
- That's them. You know them?

35:15.446 --> 35:18.866
They have contracts with the Pentagon
and all over the world. Why?

35:18.866 --> 35:20.701
[Peter] The assassins
who killed the Campbells

35:20.701 --> 35:21.994
might be working for Turn Lake.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.496
You have evidence of this?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.164
Enough to start an investigation, yeah.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.708
[Diane] <i>Gather everything you've got.
We need to brief POTUS.</i>

35:27.708 --> 35:30.795
You and Rose need to get your asses
back to the White House right now.

35:30.795 --> 35:31.963
Yes, ma'am.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.714
Rose, we gotta go.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.800
Wait, wait, wait.
I... I think I found something.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.009
What? What is all this?

35:37.009 --> 35:40.179
[Rose] It's the FEC's public database
of campaign donations.

35:40.179 --> 35:42.849
We're trying to look for someone bad
in the White House, right?

35:42.849 --> 35:43.766
Yeah.

35:43.766 --> 35:47.228
If you wanna know who bad people
are in bed with, you follow the money.

35:47.228 --> 35:50.231
And it looks like
a lot of Turn Lake's money went to...

35:54.777 --> 35:56.445
Vice President Redfield.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.613
This is all real?

35:58.197 --> 35:59.240
Welcome to the party.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.950
[tense music playing]

36:01.826 --> 36:06.164
Okay, um, you said Hawkins met up
with someone high up, right?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.123
Yeah.

36:08.416 --> 36:11.669
Okay, the CEO's name is Gordon Wick.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.045
[keyboard clacking]

36:13.880 --> 36:15.423
[Peter] I've never heard of him.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.216
Maybe the vice president has.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.760
[keyboard clacking]

36:21.429 --> 36:23.264
Holy shit.
Yeah, I'd say they know each other.

36:23.264 --> 36:27.059
This goes way back.
Social events, conferences, think tanks.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.187
I think we found our guy.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.439
Print all this out.
We'll take it all to Travers.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.483
Wait, wait, wait.
The president wants to see us?

36:34.483 --> 36:35.818
Welcome to the party.

36:42.074 --> 36:43.910
You should get some rest while we can.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.706
When you promised no more motels,

36:49.290 --> 36:52.210
I didn't think you meant
we'd be living in a parking lot.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.088
I miss our baths.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.173
I know, me too.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.176
But we shouldn't be here much longer.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.303
So rest.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.347
At least the motel had a TV.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.432
All the more reason for you to rest, no?

37:07.308 --> 37:08.142
Fine.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.812
[woman breathing deeply]

37:15.733 --> 37:17.485
We should've kept that baby.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.445
In Wisconsin.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.114
[man] The baby was a prop.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.283
I know.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.035
But...

37:27.578 --> 37:28.871
what if we kept her?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.541
- You want the baby now?
- [woman] Not that baby.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.712
Maybe we could find another baby to take.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.881
- Why?
- Because then we'd have a baby.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.258
Are you paying attention?

37:40.258 --> 37:41.968
No, I'm try... I'm trying to rest.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.594
Resting.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.555
When we met,

37:47.098 --> 37:50.977
you said this job was easier
with a woman by your side.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.437
No one worries about the couple
who follows them.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.358
That's right. With a baby,
that lady just let us into her house.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.152
Think about how easy it'd be
if we were a real family.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.071
We can't take care of a baby.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.115
Apart from it just being annoying,

38:04.115 --> 38:06.617
it wouldn't survive our life,
not to mention our employers.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.535
Okay.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.496
They'd never give us another assignment
if they knew we had a baby.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.081
And what would you wanna do--

38:12.081 --> 38:13.374
Okay!

38:16.210 --> 38:18.379
It wasn't a suggestion
for right now anyway.

38:19.046 --> 38:22.758
Maybe down the road,
in the future, don't rule it out.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.844
Um, I'm ruling it out.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.804
It's... it's ruled out.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.772
[fingers tapping]

38:41.360 --> 38:43.321
- Monks, can I talk to you?
- [Erik] Yeah.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.616
- Everything okay?
- I'm gonna stay on shift for the art show.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.076
You can take the night off.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.454
All right.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.998
- Is that a problem for you?
- [Erik] No.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.208
No, I'm just, um,

38:57.543 --> 39:00.171
I'm just wondering how long
you're gonna hold this grudge,

39:00.171 --> 39:02.465
instead of giving me a second chance.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.966
- A grudge?
- Yes, ma'am.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.926
This isn't about you.
It's about the protectee.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.094
I wanna be there for her,

39:07.094 --> 39:09.347
which means I gotta bump someone,
and you're the new guy.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.390
Who also happens to be
the only member of my detail

39:11.390 --> 39:13.434
who's ever shit the bed
in a high-stakes situation.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.355
You really think that bar was high stakes?

39:19.690 --> 39:22.234
- You think this assignment's a joke--
- I never once said that.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.903
Yeah, well, everyone else does.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.531
You know why you've never seen
someone like me leading a detail?

39:27.531 --> 39:29.158
It doesn't fucking happen.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.410
This might be an extension
of rehab for you.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.995
- Extension--
- For me, it's a guillotine.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.956
Everything here reflects on me,
and I cannot fuck this up.

39:35.956 --> 39:39.418
One mistake, and it's my career.
You of all people should know that.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.546
Yes, I of all people do know that.

39:49.595 --> 39:50.471
I'm sorry.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.894
Listen, I know that I came off
a little old-school at first,

39:58.062 --> 39:59.021
but I get it.

39:59.522 --> 40:02.316
I get it. You're in charge.
I respect that.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.610
I wanna see you succeed.

40:06.112 --> 40:06.946
Yeah?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.448
Then learn to take an order.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.035
I mean, this isn't even about
what happened at the bar.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.620
Maddie had a rough morning.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.872
I'm gonna stay with her
in case she needs me.

40:16.872 --> 40:20.126
And I know you don't agree
with that approach, but it's my call.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.878
And by the way,

40:22.878 --> 40:25.339
if I wasn't willing
to give you a second chance,

40:25.339 --> 40:26.882
you wouldn't still be here.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.137
[dramatic music playing]

40:37.643 --> 40:40.646
How much do retail therapists make?
I should ask for a raise.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.065
You're supposed to be off tonight.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.402
I figured you'd be more relaxed
with me there instead of the new guy.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.821
Chelsea, no.
You're always taking care of me.

40:48.821 --> 40:52.241
I always ask for too much.
You deserve a night off to yourself.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.159
[Chelsea] I like art.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.328
Besides, never know when you'll need
more tips on federal-agent couture.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.913
[both chuckling]

40:57.913 --> 40:58.998
Got your panic button?

40:59.874 --> 41:00.708
Yes, Mom.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.462
[tense music playing]

41:08.132 --> 41:10.134
[jazzy music playing]

41:10.968 --> 41:12.970
[indistinct chatter]

41:27.485 --> 41:29.195
- Oh, there she is.
- [Chelsea] Okay.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.449
Harper.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.366
- Hi!
- Hi!

41:34.366 --> 41:35.910
- [Maddie] Congratulations.
- Thank you.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.835
Yeah. I'm just gonna be right back.

41:44.835 --> 41:45.753
[Harper] Okay.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.634
- I'm just gonna use the restroom.
- [Chelsea] Okay.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.636
Bathroom break.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.306
Copy that.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.227
[door opening]

42:24.542 --> 42:25.417
All clear.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.719
[tense music playing]

42:36.554 --> 42:38.222
[Maddie exhaling slowly]

43:00.327 --> 43:02.162
Hey. It's them.

43:02.162 --> 43:04.415
[suspenseful music playing]

43:15.467 --> 43:16.802
Finally.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.179
Okay, let's go.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.265
[car engine starting]

43:39.742 --> 43:41.160
Maddie, everything okay?

43:45.289 --> 43:46.165
Maddie?

43:51.211 --> 43:52.921
No, you fucking didn't.

44:01.639 --> 44:02.514
[Erik] I swear to God,

44:02.514 --> 44:06.852
Almora couldn't string together a sentence
that night to save his life.

44:06.852 --> 44:09.813
If you stabbed him,
he would have bled Jose Cuervo.

44:09.813 --> 44:10.898
[all chuckling]

44:10.898 --> 44:12.691
The boss man couldn't hold his liquor?

44:12.691 --> 44:15.361
[Erik] Oh, he held it.
Couldn't do much else with it.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.821
But he held it. It didn't matter though.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.908
Gentlemen,
the moral of the story that night

44:20.908 --> 44:23.535
is don't pick bar fights
with the Secret Service.

44:23.535 --> 44:26.121
Arrington would never let
that kind of shit fly around here.

44:26.121 --> 44:27.289
That's right.

44:27.289 --> 44:29.541
Trust me. It's for the best.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.504
[cell phones beeping]

44:34.630 --> 44:35.964
Badger's missing. All hands.

44:36.965 --> 44:38.467
[knocking on door]

44:46.892 --> 44:50.729
Could I use your phone? I seem to be lost.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.606
You look incredible.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.739
You sure you weren't followed?

45:01.323 --> 45:02.282
I'm positive.

45:04.243 --> 45:07.329
Positive that I could spend days here.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.123
- [man chuckling]
- [door closing]

45:09.123 --> 45:10.332
How long do we have?

45:10.833 --> 45:12.543
- A couple hours.
- Okay.

45:12.543 --> 45:17.089
Any longer, and it becomes
a national fucking crisis.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.134
Well, dinner should be ready soon.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.051
Yeah?

45:22.428 --> 45:26.014
What if I... want dessert first?

45:26.932 --> 45:30.144
I think we should talk first.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.230
Hmm. I think we should talk later.

45:37.192 --> 45:40.362
She left the gallery through a window
that leads out to a side street.

45:40.362 --> 45:41.905
It's possible she got into a vehicle.

45:41.905 --> 45:45.826
Eli, David, set up a perimeter
with our guys and PD as they arrive.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.411
Six blocks, then expand.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.663
Ensure you're on comms
in case she hits her panic button.

45:49.663 --> 45:50.873
On it.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.459
Jeff, pull security footage
from cameras on that block.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.836
Check in every ten minutes.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.796
[suspenseful music playing]

45:58.547 --> 46:00.591
[breath shuddering]

46:00.591 --> 46:02.301
Tell me what you need from me.

46:03.510 --> 46:04.928
I'm missing something.

46:04.928 --> 46:06.430
This was planned.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.308
All that business about a dress,
it's like she was going on a date.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.643
- Is that unusual?
- No, she's gone on dates before.

46:11.643 --> 46:12.936
It's never been a big deal.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.272
Half the time she can't wait to tell me
about her crush.

46:15.272 --> 46:16.440
[Erik] Anything different?

46:16.440 --> 46:18.817
Look like she was trying
to meet someone there?

46:18.817 --> 46:21.570
No, that's the part I'm missing.
Why hide it?

46:24.031 --> 46:27.201
You ever notice anything strange
with her art professor?

46:27.201 --> 46:28.202
What do you mean?

46:28.202 --> 46:32.080
Yesterday, I noticed something
a little charged between them.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.582
I figured it was nothing, but...

46:36.418 --> 46:40.464
People hide things
they think others won't approve of.

46:44.510 --> 46:45.636
Shit.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.846
Call it in and get his address.
I'll drive.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.724
[both breathing heavily]

46:53.185 --> 46:54.144
[man sighing]

46:54.144 --> 46:55.187
[Maddie] It's okay.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.022
I want this.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.902
Look, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

47:11.954 --> 47:12.913
Oh my God!

47:13.705 --> 47:16.375
What are you doing?
I told you I'd call when we were done.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.252
What... what the fuck? You know him?

47:18.252 --> 47:19.336
I can explain.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.507
Please, you don't have to force her.
She'll say what we need her to say.

47:25.384 --> 47:27.386
- I need something else.
- [man] Wait, why?

47:27.386 --> 47:29.763
- [man grunting, gurgling]
- [Maddie screaming]

47:29.763 --> 47:30.681
Don't cry for him.

47:30.681 --> 47:33.016
He was using you
for his "save the environment" bullshit.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.227
What I need from you
is much more important.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.063
- [gurgling]
- [Maddie] No!

47:38.063 --> 47:40.607
- [Maddie screaming]
- [intense music playing]

47:41.191 --> 47:42.109
No!

47:43.277 --> 47:45.279
[Maddie screaming, straining]

47:53.203 --> 47:55.205
[Maddie continues screaming]

47:57.833 --> 47:58.959
[music fades]

48:00.335 --> 48:01.253
[knocking on door]

48:06.800 --> 48:08.552
Wait here. I'll check around back.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.555
[sinister music playing]

48:19.521 --> 48:20.731
[Erik] Breach, breach!

48:30.574 --> 48:31.408
Maddie?

48:37.581 --> 48:38.582
[Erik] Clear.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.219
[music swelling]

48:52.763 --> 48:53.805
[music fades]

48:54.806 --> 48:56.308
[ending theme music playing]
