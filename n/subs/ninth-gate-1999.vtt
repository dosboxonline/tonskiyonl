05:36.177 --> 05:40.308
It's an impressive collection. You have some very rare editions here.

05:41.003 --> 05:42.744
Are you sure you want to send them all?

05:42.961 --> 05:45.178
They're of no use to father, not anymore.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.831
Not since he's been this way.

05:48.049 --> 05:50.485
His library was his whole world. Now it's just...

05:50.745 --> 05:52.094
...a painful memory.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.963
Unbearably painful.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.094
I understand.

05:58.704 --> 05:59.541
Well,

06:00.270 --> 06:03.792
at a rough preliminary estimate

06:04.054 --> 06:05.706
you have a collection here

06:06.488 --> 06:08.837
- worth around 600,000 dollars. - 600,000?

06:09.489 --> 06:11.534
Yes, worth that about.

06:12.838 --> 06:14.751
I have picked up one or two volumes

06:14.752 --> 06:16.491
that merit special attention.

06:16.753 --> 06:19.362
This "Persiles", for example, is important.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.188
I'd hang on to that. It'll never depreciate.

06:22.406 --> 06:24.580
- It's a good investment. - Valuable?

06:24.971 --> 06:26.233
Very valuable.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.060
As for this "Hypneratomachia di Poliphilo"

06:30.626 --> 06:33.191
by Colonna, Venice, 1545,

06:34.409 --> 06:36.714
I'm sure I can find you a buyer.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.888
But I wouldn't let the rest go for less than 500,000

06:40.150 --> 06:41.803
under any circumstances.

06:43.454 --> 06:45.151
It may take a month to sort of place them

06:45.325 --> 06:47.152
so in the meantime I advise you to be patient

06:47.282 --> 06:48.238
A month?

06:48.412 --> 06:50.544
Yes, a month or two, depends on how much of a hurry you're in, and see,

06:50.545 --> 06:53.196
more hurry, less money.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.067
- Of course. - Well, that's my advice anyway.

06:57.371 --> 06:59.625
I'm sure you wouldn't want to rush things

06:59.626 --> 07:01.878
but please feel free to consult another expert

07:01.982 --> 07:04.243
aand if you have any questions you know where to reach me.

07:04.461 --> 07:07.765
Incidentally, this four-volume edition

07:07.983 --> 07:12.028
of "Don Quixote" is quite nice, but not particularly valuable.

07:12.245 --> 07:14.637
Now, I could

07:14.898 --> 07:17.116
take it off your hands

07:18.203 --> 07:19.246
right away.

07:23.074 --> 07:25.336
How much were you thinking of?

07:25.771 --> 07:29.206
Oh, I couldn't go more than 4,000 - 4,200

07:29.815 --> 07:31.032
Oh, fine.

07:40.165 --> 07:41.470
- You here? - Hello Witkin.

07:41.601 --> 07:42.687
You didn't waste much time.

07:42.688 --> 07:45.080
Listen, there's a small fortune in there. Help yourself.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.645
You're a vulture Corso! A vulture!

07:47.646 --> 07:50.603
- Who isn't in our business? - You'd stuck to anything.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.908
For a Quixote by Ybarra? You bet I would.

07:52.909 --> 07:56.039
Unscrupulous! Thoroughly unscrupulous!

07:56.387 --> 07:57.692
Happy hunting.

08:17.436 --> 08:21.264
I've just got on the phone with Witkin. He's spitting blood.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.916
Really? What's his problem?

08:26.395 --> 08:29.961
He said you're a double-dealing moneygrabbing bastard.

08:31.092 --> 08:35.267
He thought he had that deal sold up. He said you queered his pitch.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.441
He should have been quicker and offer them more.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.268
- May I? - Sure.

08:40.442 --> 08:43.530
And he said your evaluation was way over the top.

08:43.922 --> 08:46.574
And those people coming out in a rash

08:47.009 --> 08:50.140
now they're asking twice what those books are worth.

08:56.316 --> 08:57.056
Let's face it.

08:57.273 --> 09:00.577
- You screw it off, that's what it's called. - That's what it's called.

09:00.578 --> 09:03.274
He also said that you snatched the "Don Qui-"

09:10.581 --> 09:14.321
Ybarra, "Don Quixote", 1780.

09:14.886 --> 09:17.234
All four volumes.

09:17.408 --> 09:21.235
Son of a bitch. Fantastic.

09:21.236 --> 09:23.671
Fantastic, you are the best.

09:24.366 --> 09:27.716
That client of yours, the Swiss, d'ya think he'd still be interested in this edition?

09:27.933 --> 09:30.891
I have Witkin on my ass, I really told him I had no part in this operation.

09:31.325 --> 09:32.978
Except 10%.

09:33.934 --> 09:36.370
20%. The Swiss is my client.

09:36.979 --> 09:37.979
No deal.

09:38.197 --> 09:41.371
- 15, for my children's sake. - You don't have any children.

09:41.545 --> 09:42.981
I'm still young, give me time.

09:44.155 --> 09:45.036
Ten.

10:26.644 --> 10:30.384
...and earlier in 1580, in "De la Dèmonomanie des sorciers"

10:30.601 --> 10:32.428
by the French Jean Bodin.

10:32.863 --> 10:37.673
Bodin was probably the first to attempt to estabilish a system,

10:37.738 --> 10:41.419
if the term "system" may be applied to the Middle Ages,

10:41.765 --> 10:44.539
for classifying the contemporary perceptions of evil.

10:45.301 --> 10:49.781
In Bodin we find one of the first definitions of the word "witch".

10:49.998 --> 10:51.172
I quote:

10:52.404 --> 10:53.597
"A witch is a person

10:53.598 --> 10:56.304
who, though cognizant in the laws of God,

10:56.478 --> 11:00.434
endeavours to act thorugh the medium of a pact with the Devil.

11:00.435 --> 11:04.436
To assist them in their work, many witches kept familiars,

11:04.784 --> 11:07.567
that is to say creatures such as cats or toads

11:07.829 --> 11:12.091
in which supernatural spirits or demons were thought to reside.

11:12.526 --> 11:15.570
For those of you, ladies and gentlemen who wish to dare more deeply

11:15.744 --> 11:18.136
into the controvertial subject of witchcraft,

11:18.353 --> 11:20.091
a great deal of relevant information

11:20.092 --> 11:22.562
may be found in the following works:

11:23.398 --> 11:25.790
Nicolas Remis "Demonolatriae libri"

11:26.008 --> 11:29.443
and "Compendium Maleficarum", by Francesco Maria Guazo.

11:39.011 --> 11:43.229
I see you were stimulated by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

11:47.143 --> 11:48.057
Did I snore?

11:48.274 --> 11:52.102
Most nice of you to ask. No, not that I noticed.

11:52.797 --> 11:53.580
Shall we go?

12:03.322 --> 12:05.714
- Don't you sleep nice? - Like a baby.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.453
Strange.

12:07.497 --> 12:09.757
I'd have bet a brace of Gutenberg Bibles

12:09.758 --> 12:12.716
you spend half the night with your eyes peeled

12:12.846 --> 12:15.847
You're one of those lean, hungry restless types

12:15.890 --> 12:17.673
that put the wind up Julius Caesar.

12:17.847 --> 12:20.848
Men who stab their friends in the back.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.676
Not that I suspect you have many friends, do you Mr. Corso?

12:27.677 --> 12:29.763
Your kind seldom does.

12:30.286 --> 12:31.894
That makes two of us.

12:39.201 --> 12:40.897
You're right, of course.

12:41.158 --> 12:43.680
Your friendships don't concern me in the least.

12:43.854 --> 12:47.420
Our relations have always been strictly commercial, and that's the way I like it.

12:47.595 --> 12:50.769
The professional and the personal should be mutually exclusive.

12:50.986 --> 12:54.118
Listen, I came here to do some business, not to shoot to breeze.

12:54.553 --> 12:58.119
If you want to expound you personal philosophies, write another book.

12:58.293 --> 12:59.467
You don't like me, do you?

12:59.685 --> 13:02.119
I don't have to like you. You're a client and you pay well.

13:17.385 --> 13:19.428
You're a priviledged, Mr. Corso.

13:19.951 --> 13:22.690
Very few people ever set foot in here.

13:22.691 --> 13:24.821
This is my private collection.

13:25.604 --> 13:29.257
Some bibliophiles specialise in gothic novels,

13:29.519 --> 13:30.431
others in Books of Hours.

13:31.779 --> 13:34.998
All my own rare editions have the same protagonist:

13:35.650 --> 13:36.521
the Devil.

13:36.694 --> 13:39.043
- May I take a look? - Yes.

13:39.304 --> 13:40.521
That's why I brought you here.

13:56.699 --> 13:58.178
Beautiful, aren't they?

13:59.048 --> 14:02.396
Their soft sheen, their superb guilding,

14:03.310 --> 14:06.355
not to mention the centuries of wisdom they contain.

14:06.571 --> 14:09.181
I know people who would kill for a collection like this.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.878
The "Ars Diavoli".

14:12.486 --> 14:16.530
You'll never see as many books on the subject anywhere else in the world.

14:17.009 --> 14:20.271
They're the rarest, the choicest editions in existence.

14:20.488 --> 14:22.706
It's taken me a lifetime to assemble them.

14:23.055 --> 14:25.663
Only the supreme masterpiece was missing.

14:26.359 --> 14:27.403
Come.

14:36.361 --> 14:38.610
"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows".

14:38.841 --> 14:43.103
- You're familiar with it. - Yes, Venice 1666.

14:43.233 --> 14:47.452
The author and printer Aristide Torchia was burned by the Holy Inquisition

14:47.756 --> 14:48.974
together with all his works.

14:49.974 --> 14:52.671
- Only three copies survived. - One.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.802
The Catalogue has three copies surviving, of private ownership:

14:55.803 --> 14:58.323
the Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.

14:58.324 --> 15:02.021
It's true, you know your business. But you're mistaken nonetheless.

15:02.282 --> 15:04.978
According to my own research, only one is authentic.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.630
Well, three are known.

15:07.414 --> 15:08.806
That's the trouble.

15:09.762 --> 15:12.937
- Where did you get it? - I bought it from Telfer.

15:13.502 --> 15:15.981
- Telfer? - Yes, he fnally sold it to me.

15:16.242 --> 15:18.243
The day before he killed himself.

15:19.199 --> 15:20.722
That's good timing.

15:29.246 --> 15:31.333
"Silentium est aureum".

15:32.247 --> 15:35.247
- Silence is golden. - Precisely.

15:36.595 --> 15:38.596
Ever heard of the "Delomelanicon"?

15:39.031 --> 15:41.727
I have heard of it, yes. It's a myth, isn't it?

15:42.249 --> 15:44.510
A book reputed to have been written by Satan himself

15:44.728 --> 15:47.424
No myth. That book existed.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.816
Torchia actually acquired it.

15:53.122 --> 15:58.297
The engravings you are now admiring were adapted by Torchia from the "Delomelanicon".

15:59.080 --> 16:01.907
They form a kind of satanic riddle.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.451
Correctly interpreted with the aid of the original text,

16:05.452 --> 16:06.821
and sufficient inside information,

16:06.822 --> 16:11.039
they're reputed to conjure up the Prince of Darkness in person.

16:11.865 --> 16:13.126
You don't say.

16:14.823 --> 16:16.824
Are you a religious man, Mr. Corso?

16:17.084 --> 16:19.955
I mean, do you believe in the supernatural?

16:20.216 --> 16:22.259
I believe in my percentage.

16:24.912 --> 16:26.826
Aren't you getting dizzy standing there?

16:31.306 --> 16:33.175
What is it that you want from me, Balkan?

16:39.394 --> 16:41.612
I want you to go to Europe and investigate.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.830
The other two copies are in Portugal and France.

16:44.831 --> 16:47.810
I want you to find some way of comparing them with mine.

16:47.811 --> 16:50.789
Every page, every engraving, the binding, everything.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.746
I'm convinced only one is authentic I wanna know which.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.529
That can be an expensive trip.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.791
That's to get you started. Spend what you need.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.191
What if I find that your copy's a forgery?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.417
It's quite possible.

17:07.315 --> 17:08.315
Really?

17:10.229 --> 17:11.838
It doesn't appear to be.

17:15.012 --> 17:16.665
Even the paper sounds couture.

17:16.796 --> 17:19.361
Even so, something's wrong.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.492
You mean the Devil won't show up.

17:24.145 --> 17:28.582
If all three copies turn out to be bogus or incomplete your work will be done.

17:28.583 --> 17:33.017
If, on the other hand, one of them turns out to be genuine, I'll finance you further.

17:33.234 --> 17:34.583
I want you to get it for me.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.714
At all costs. Nevermind how.

17:37.801 --> 17:39.584
"Nevermind how" sounds illegal.

17:39.801 --> 17:42.672
It wouldn't be the first time you've done something illegal.

17:42.673 --> 17:45.543
- Not that illegal. - Hence the size of the check.

17:50.631 --> 17:53.153
Do a good job. I'll double it.

17:57.154 --> 18:00.025
There's gotta be something wrong with it if you're letting it out of your hands.

18:00.026 --> 18:02.503
I have the outmost faith in you, Mr. Corso.

18:02.590 --> 18:06.852
There's nothing more reliable than a man whose loyalty can be bought for hand cash.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.651
Good morning. Dean Corso.

19:09.912 --> 19:12.609
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you at a time like this.

19:24.003 --> 19:28.656
It would be very helpful ma'am if you could tell me what you know about

19:28.874 --> 19:30.004
this book.

19:38.528 --> 19:41.355
- Isn't this one of my husband's books? - Right.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.704
It was in his collection until very recently. He sold it to a client of mine.

19:45.835 --> 19:47.661
I'm trying to authenticate it.

19:47.878 --> 19:49.227
He sold it, you say?

19:49.836 --> 19:52.576
How strange, this was one of his most treasured possessions.

19:52.662 --> 19:55.924
- He never mentioned this sale? - No, it's news to me.

19:56.837 --> 19:59.969
- Who bought it? - A private collector.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.013
May I know his name?

20:03.362 --> 20:04.970
I'm afraid that's confidential.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.667
- I suppose he has a bill of sale. - No problem there.

20:08.668 --> 20:11.928
Is this your job? Authenticating rare books?

20:11.930 --> 20:13.581
And tracking them down, yes.

20:14.538 --> 20:17.278
- You're a book-detective. - Kind of.

20:19.279 --> 20:22.410
Do you recall when and where your husband acquired this book?

20:24.453 --> 20:25.628
In Spain.

20:26.194 --> 20:30.760
We were vacationing at Toledo. Andrew was very excited.

20:31.151 --> 20:33.326
He paid a great deal of money for it.

20:34.370 --> 20:36.370
He was a fanatical collector.

20:36.631 --> 20:37.615
So I gather.

20:39.545 --> 20:40.458
I'll show you.

21:02.421 --> 21:03.855
It's impressive.

21:04.073 --> 21:06.552
Andrew used to spend many hours in here.

21:08.552 --> 21:09.335
Too many.

21:09.857 --> 21:11.031
Did he ever try it out?

21:12.423 --> 21:13.510
I don't understand.

21:14.119 --> 21:14.858
The book.

21:16.032 --> 21:18.707
Did he ever use it to perform some kind of ritual

21:18.708 --> 21:21.381
intended to produce a supernatural effect?

21:21.643 --> 21:24.382
- Are you serious? - Yes, absolutely.

21:25.209 --> 21:28.775
Andrew was a trifle eccentric, Mr. Corso,

21:28.819 --> 21:30.688
But he wasn't insane.

21:30.993 --> 21:33.211
It's true he'd been acting

21:34.647 --> 21:36.472
strange in those last few days,

21:36.690 --> 21:41.039
he shut himself up in here, he seldom emerged, except for meals.

21:42.083 --> 21:46.258
That morning I was awoken by the screams of the maid.

21:50.738 --> 21:52.086
He'd hanged himself.

21:55.956 --> 21:57.555
Whatever he was up to,

21:57.556 --> 22:02.480
I certainly can't see him chanting mambo jambo or trying to raise the dead.

22:02.481 --> 22:07.655
The Devil, Mrs. Telfer. This book is designed to raise the Devil.

22:59.756 --> 23:02.931
"Sic luceat lux".

23:04.148 --> 23:06.279
"Thus might the light shine".

26:03.935 --> 26:06.718
Son of a bitch. Where did you get this?

26:06.936 --> 26:07.936
Balkan.

26:08.327 --> 26:10.240
He wants me to research it.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.241
Balkan owns a "Nine Gates"?

26:13.459 --> 26:16.372
Recently acquired by the late lamented Andrew Telfer.

26:16.590 --> 26:17.678
Trust Balkan...

26:17.894 --> 26:21.156
What does he need you for? I don't suppose he plans to sell it?

26:21.591 --> 26:24.112
He wants me to compare it with the other two survival copies

26:24.113 --> 26:26.513
which are in Portugal and France.

26:26.723 --> 26:28.550
So I'm off to Europe.

26:28.724 --> 26:29.724
Compare it?

26:30.550 --> 26:33.551
Yes. Only one of the three is authentic, he says.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.595
But this looks genuine enough.

26:37.291 --> 26:41.510
Chrissake, it's gotta be worth a million. Take care of it.

26:41.684 --> 26:44.858
That's why I'm here. I need you to stash it for me.

26:45.685 --> 26:47.207
'Cause I'm starting to see things.

26:47.250 --> 26:50.643
- Like what? - Uninvited visitors, unfamiliar faces.

26:51.555 --> 26:53.904
I don't trust anyone, not even Balkan.

26:54.818 --> 26:56.469
I come to think I'm not even sure I trust you.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.710
You know I wouldn't screw you unless there was a good reason:

27:00.367 --> 27:01.984
money, women, business...

27:02.124 --> 27:03.776
Other than that you can relax.

27:05.168 --> 27:07.560
- I'll take it up on my way to the airport. - Sure.

27:09.387 --> 27:11.386
These engravings are terrific.

27:11.779 --> 27:13.822
Or horrific, whichever.

27:14.301 --> 27:17.258
Sensational, absolutely sensational.

28:00.965 --> 28:02.183
May I come in?

28:12.751 --> 28:13.795
Please, sit down.

28:17.665 --> 28:19.709
I've come to talk business.

28:22.014 --> 28:24.711
Yesterday, when you came to see me about that book,

28:27.320 --> 28:30.234
I was too surprised to react as I should have done.

28:30.451 --> 28:32.843
I mean it really was one of Andrew's favourites.

28:33.582 --> 28:34.626
So you said.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.757
I'd like to get it back.

28:38.627 --> 28:41.323
- That could be a problem. - Not necessarily, it all depends.

28:41.324 --> 28:43.977
- On what? - On you.

28:44.542 --> 28:47.934
I don't understand, Mrs. Terfel. The book is not mine to dispose of.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.329
You work for money, I take it?

28:59.502 --> 29:00.459
What else?

29:00.589 --> 29:03.156
- I have a great deal of money. - I'm very happy for you.

29:03.373 --> 29:04.852
You could stage a theft.

29:05.069 --> 29:07.331
I imagine your client is well insured.

29:09.891 --> 29:09.939
- I'm a professional, ma'am. - You're a professional mercenary.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.204
Mercenaries work for the highest bidder.

29:14.506 --> 29:16.072
I could throw in a bonus.

29:17.812 --> 29:21.421
- This has happened before in some place. - I know, in the movies.

29:21.422 --> 29:23.117
She had an automatic her stocking...

29:27.597 --> 29:29.206
No automatic.

29:38.948 --> 29:41.209
- Would you like a drink? - Why not?

31:13.364 --> 31:15.147
Okay. Where is it?

31:15.712 --> 31:17.016
Where's what?

31:17.843 --> 31:19.713
Don't fuck with me!

31:21.758 --> 31:23.367
I thought I already did.

31:54.896 --> 31:59.463
You have reached "Bernie's Rare Books". Please leave your message after the beep.

32:01.116 --> 32:02.985
Bernie, you there?

32:04.812 --> 32:05.856
Pick up.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.299
Give me a minute, I won't be long.

32:37.429 --> 32:40.256
- Then you can take me on the "Kennedy" - No problem sir.

33:16.004 --> 33:17.266
Oh Jesus!

33:33.748 --> 33:35.184
Jesus Christ...

34:37.244 --> 34:38.504
None problem?

35:15.166 --> 35:15.993
Stop.

35:16.514 --> 35:18.255
Stop by that phone booth, pull over.

35:18.297 --> 35:19.733
No problem sir.

35:26.605 --> 35:28.822
He isn't available at the time. May I know who's calling?

35:30.083 --> 35:33.954
- You'd like to leave a message? - No, I have to talk with him at once.

35:34.172 --> 35:35.338
I'm afraid he is in transit.

35:35.339 --> 35:36.505
If you can give me your number,

35:36.506 --> 35:38.715
I'll have him return it when he checks us.

35:38.999 --> 35:42.131
No, I'm in a phone booth. It's an emergency.

35:42.782 --> 35:45.957
I have to speak with him right now. Right now, do you hear me?

35:45.958 --> 35:46.957
Right now.

35:48.828 --> 35:49.784
One moment.

36:08.006 --> 36:09.573
- Are you there, Mr. Corso? - Yeah.

36:09.574 --> 36:10.877
Ok, I'll put him through.

36:15.835 --> 36:17.618
Mr. Corso, what have you got for me?

36:17.879 --> 36:19.401
More than I'd bargained for.

36:19.748 --> 36:22.054
- What do you mean? - I mean I quit.

36:22.489 --> 36:24.402
I wanna return you the book. Where are you?

36:24.620 --> 36:28.751
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso. You never let me down before.

36:29.142 --> 36:31.013
Well, this is different.

36:31.534 --> 36:33.361
Do you remember Bernie Orenstein?

36:34.649 --> 36:35.716
The dealer?

36:35.821 --> 36:37.900
I gave him your book to stash it for me

36:38.145 --> 36:40.189
and now he's dead, murdered.

36:40.450 --> 36:42.973
- Because of the book? - What else?

36:44.277 --> 36:48.191
Look, I've never said it would be easy. If it's a question of money...

36:48.322 --> 36:49.931
It isn't the money, I want out.

36:50.105 --> 36:52.714
This matter means a great deal to me, Mr. Corso.

36:52.932 --> 36:54.845
I'm not an ungenerous man, you know that.

36:55.063 --> 36:59.368
Proceed as arranged, and you can tack another zero onto your fee.

37:00.759 --> 37:02.890
What... Hey, where are you?

37:57.818 --> 38:01.254
- Good evening. - Good evening. Come in.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.428
- You speak English? - Yes, I do.

38:05.820 --> 38:08.168
I would like to get your opinion on this.

38:19.563 --> 38:22.303
What a habit for a book binder...

38:22.911 --> 38:26.521
"The Nine Gates" - superb edition. Very rare.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.522
The Telfer copy.

38:29.131 --> 38:31.479
Yes. You used to own it, right?

38:31.523 --> 38:33.131
- We used to, yes. - We sold it.

38:33.132 --> 38:36.524
...when the opportunity presented itself. It was too good to..

38:36.525 --> 38:38.959
...too good to miss. An excellent sale.

38:39.003 --> 38:41.699
An excellent buying! Impeccable condition.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.439
Impeccable. Are you the present owner?

38:44.613 --> 38:46.266
No, A client of mine.

38:46.701 --> 38:50.180
I would never have believed she would part with it. Never.

38:50.615 --> 38:52.572
- She? - Mrs. Telfer.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.182
I understood that it was Mr. Telfer that had bought it.

38:58.268 --> 38:59.530
He'd pay for it.

39:00.095 --> 39:02.190
It was Mrs. Telfer who made him buy it.

39:02.191 --> 39:04.285
- He didn't seem particularly... - ...interested.

39:06.184 --> 39:08.445
An exceptional specimen.

39:08.619 --> 39:12.055
- Do you think it could be a forgery? - Forgery? Hear that, Pablo?

39:12.142 --> 39:15.926
I took you for a professional. You speak too lightly of forgeries.

39:15.927 --> 39:17.230
Far too lightly.

39:17.665 --> 39:20.492
Forging a book is very expensive.

39:20.710 --> 39:25.015
Paper of the period, right inks, Too expensive to be profitable.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.580
- Still it can be done. - Of course.

39:27.581 --> 39:29.973
It requires a great skill, but yes it can be done.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.060
Do you think that could be the case here?

39:32.408 --> 39:33.409
What makes you ask?

39:33.626 --> 39:37.279
My client wishes to satisfy himself on the book's authenticity.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.626
His name's Balkan. Boris Balkan of New York.

39:40.627 --> 39:44.237
- All books have a destiny of their own. - And a life of their own.

39:44.802 --> 39:47.717
Mr. Balkan is a celebrated collector.

39:47.934 --> 39:50.848
He's no fool, he must know this book is authentic.

39:51.195 --> 39:52.674
- We know it. - So must he.

39:52.675 --> 39:54.979
- We've had this book for years. - Many years.

39:55.023 --> 39:57.197
With ample opportunity to study it thoroughly.

39:57.806 --> 39:59.284
The printing, the binding,

39:59.285 --> 40:03.069
are magnificent examples of 17th century Venetian craftsmanship.

40:03.155 --> 40:07.090
Finest rag-paper. Resistent to the passage of time.

40:07.347 --> 40:09.839
None of your modern wood-pulp.

40:10.419 --> 40:12.202
Watermarks, ink,

40:12.419 --> 40:14.071
typefaces...

40:14.376 --> 40:15.375
If this is a forgery,

40:15.376 --> 40:19.290
or a copy with missing pages restored, is the work of a master.

40:21.812 --> 40:26.901
Have you studied the engravings? They seem to have some underlying significance.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.422
But of course.

40:28.423 --> 40:29.641
Here, for example.

40:29.902 --> 40:33.272
This one could be interpreted as a warning:

40:33.273 --> 40:36.643
"Venture too far" it seems to say, "and danger will descend on you from above".

40:37.861 --> 40:40.556
These types of books often contain little puzzles.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.775
Especially in the case of such an illustruous collaborator.

40:44.254 --> 40:45.384
Collaborator?

40:45.602 --> 40:48.341
You could have not proceeded, very far in your research, Señor.

40:49.037 --> 40:50.298
Here. look close.

40:50.472 --> 40:55.169
Don't you see? Only six of the nine engravings were signed by Aristide Torchia.

40:55.517 --> 40:57.735
Yes. And the other three?

40:58.431 --> 40:59.996
This is one of them.

41:00.954 --> 41:02.867
L, C, F.

41:04.476 --> 41:05.433
Who's LCF?

41:05.694 --> 41:06.563
Think.

41:13.087 --> 41:14.088
Lucifer?

41:15.783 --> 41:18.784
Very perceptive of you, Señor.

41:19.741 --> 41:21.749
Torchia was burnt alive

41:21.750 --> 41:24.713
because he wrote this book in collaboration with someone else.

41:24.742 --> 41:26.524
Come on. You can't honestly believe...

41:26.525 --> 41:30.265
The man who wrote this book did so in alliance with the Devil

41:30.395 --> 41:32.136
and went to the stake for it.

41:32.222 --> 41:34.963
Even hell has its heroes, Señor.

43:30.122 --> 43:32.428
- I have seen you before. - Have you?

43:32.958 --> 43:33.878
Yes.

43:34.559 --> 43:38.081
- Are you travelling in this car? - The next one.

43:38.168 --> 43:41.257
The sleeper... I travel on the cheap.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.953
- Are you a student? - Something like that.

43:47.171 --> 43:48.563
I like trains.

43:48.954 --> 43:52.129
- Trains I'm on? - Just trains.

43:55.347 --> 43:56.565
What's your name?

43:57.174 --> 43:58.173
Guess.

44:00.391 --> 44:02.436
- Green eyes? - That'll do.

44:02.827 --> 44:05.175
- What's yours? - Corso.

44:05.349 --> 44:06.567
Strange name.

44:07.437 --> 44:09.350
Italian, it means "to run".

44:10.047 --> 44:14.004
You don't look like a runner to me. You're more the quiet type.

44:18.135 --> 44:23.311
Well, give my regards to Balkan. Tell him I'm doing my best.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.790
- Balkan? - Nevermind.

44:27.529 --> 44:28.877
See you around.

44:29.748 --> 44:30.791
Maybe.

44:32.575 --> 44:34.444
I wouldn't be surprised.

46:12.876 --> 46:13.808
Yes?

46:14.688 --> 46:16.862
Yes... Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

46:17.167 --> 46:22.734
- Corso? Oh yes, please come in. - Thank you.

46:27.909 --> 46:29.257
Please.

46:34.780 --> 46:36.259
Home sweet home.

46:40.564 --> 46:43.130
You won't say no to a brandy I take it?

46:43.478 --> 46:44.696
Thank you very much.

46:58.996 --> 46:59.866
Thank you.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.396
What handsome glasses.

47:03.658 --> 47:05.919
They're the only ones I have left.

47:10.137 --> 47:13.138
- It has to have been a beautiful place. - It was.

47:13.486 --> 47:16.444
But old families are like ancient civilisations,

47:16.445 --> 47:18.227
they wither and die.

47:21.662 --> 47:25.445
There they are, 834 of them.

47:25.619 --> 47:28.664
What a pity you didn't see them in better times.

47:28.708 --> 47:30.491
I used to have 5,000.

47:30.708 --> 47:32.926
But these are the survivors.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.231
So this is the Fargas collection.

47:35.883 --> 47:38.014
Not quite as I imagined it I must say.

47:38.362 --> 47:39.928
C'est la vie, my friend.

47:40.232 --> 47:44.842
But I keep them in perfect conditions, safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

47:45.277 --> 47:47.278
I dust and air them every day.

47:52.279 --> 47:54.105
These are the occult.

47:54.802 --> 47:57.671
- What do you think? - Not bad.

47:57.845 --> 48:01.020
Not bad indeed. At least ten of them are extremely rare.

48:01.629 --> 48:04.630
Here: Plancy, "Dictionnaire Infernal",

48:05.630 --> 48:09.022
first edition, 1844.

48:11.197 --> 48:15.546
Leonardo Fioravanti's "Compendi dei Secreti", 1571.

48:21.635 --> 48:23.244
And there it is,

48:23.853 --> 48:25.680
in perfect condition.

48:29.985 --> 48:32.523
It has travelled the world for three and a half centuries,

48:32.524 --> 48:34.852
yet it might have been printed yesterday.

48:35.855 --> 48:39.030
Is it in order? I mean you haven't detected anything unusual?

48:39.248 --> 48:40.683
Unusual? no.

48:40.770 --> 48:44.510
The text is complete, the engravings too, nine plus the title page's,

48:44.945 --> 48:49.120
as the catalogue states, just like the Kessler in Paris and the Telfer in New York.

48:50.163 --> 48:52.860
Yes... It isn't the Telfer anymore.

48:53.295 --> 48:54.730
Telfer killed himself.

48:55.035 --> 48:57.767
But he sold his copy to Boris Balkan first.

48:58.192 --> 48:59.584
Oh, Balkan.

49:00.166 --> 49:03.776
If he sets his eye on a book no price is too high.

49:03.994 --> 49:07.560
Not that I would ever sell this one. Not at any price.

49:09.299 --> 49:14.039
It's strange that he should have sent you here if he...

49:14.648 --> 49:15.648
...already had...

49:17.910 --> 49:19.258
Do you have it here?

49:20.824 --> 49:22.042
May I see it?

49:40.872 --> 49:43.178
Oh, superb.

49:47.874 --> 49:51.832
Beautiful. Identical.

49:52.049 --> 49:54.355
Two of the only three to escape the flames

49:54.572 --> 49:57.181
reunited for the first time in over three centuries.

49:58.921 --> 50:00.052
Yes.

50:00.965 --> 50:04.128
Look at this slight imperfection here, the damaged "S"...

50:05.053 --> 50:07.619
The same type, the same impression.

50:08.445 --> 50:10.097
Oh, incredible.

50:13.012 --> 50:17.099
As you see if it wasn't for this slight discoloration on the back of your copy

50:17.187 --> 50:18.882
no one could tell them apart.

50:19.535 --> 50:23.449
If you don't mind I would like to stay for a while and examine them in detail.

50:27.102 --> 50:29.320
What are you looking for, Mr. Corso?

50:30.016 --> 50:31.669
I'm not quite sure.

50:32.278 --> 50:35.626
Some books are dangerous, not to be opened with impunity.

50:36.844 --> 50:37.974
Very true.

51:13.289 --> 51:15.202
I'll be damned!

54:16.970 --> 54:17.930
Hello again.

54:19.180 --> 54:21.730
- You didn't say you were bound for Sintra. - Neither did you.

54:21.877 --> 54:23.249
What are you doing here?

54:23.567 --> 54:24.392
Reading.

54:24.989 --> 54:26.050
I can see that.

54:26.219 --> 54:29.182
And bumping into people unexpectedly.

54:29.645 --> 54:32.532
Yes, unexpected is right.

54:33.499 --> 54:37.942
Are you on a business trip? Is that why you always carry that thing around?

54:43.921 --> 54:46.238
- Just part of your course? - My course?

54:46.775 --> 54:50.566
"Winning friends and influencing people". You said you're a student.

54:50.671 --> 54:51.468
Did I?

54:52.369 --> 54:55.018
So I am, in a way.

54:56.626 --> 54:59.547
I like books. Do you?

55:03.205 --> 55:05.262
- You been travelling long? - A while.

55:06.696 --> 55:08.406
I don't suppose you ever travel by motorbike?

55:08.407 --> 55:11.085
Sir? Excuse me sir. Phone call for you, sir.

55:11.690 --> 55:15.169
- For me? Are you sure? - Yes sir. Please sir...

55:22.258 --> 55:24.250
- Yes? - Mr. Corso?

55:24.519 --> 55:26.502
My God, how did you find me?

55:26.972 --> 55:31.269
- Made any progress? - Progress? Yeah, you can call it that.

55:31.429 --> 55:32.357
Well?

55:33.322 --> 55:36.662
Look, I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby. Let me call you back, where are you?

55:36.826 --> 55:39.247
Nevermind that. Get them to transfer it to your room.

55:39.390 --> 55:41.185
- I'll wait. - Alright.

55:41.850 --> 55:45.766
Señor, pardon me. Could you send this up to my room?

55:45.823 --> 55:47.151
- Yes. - Thank you very much.

55:56.719 --> 55:58.387
- Still there? - Yes.

55:58.859 --> 56:01.642
Alright. I've examined the Fargas copy.

56:01.908 --> 56:04.287
It's authentic enough, at least it looks that way.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.240
It's like yours, but there are discrepancies.

56:07.507 --> 56:08.714
Discrepancies?

56:10.414 --> 56:12.682
The engravings are not identical.

56:13.385 --> 56:15.221
Just like keys in different hands,

56:15.609 --> 56:18.504
doorways open in one copy and bricked up in the other...

56:18.899 --> 56:22.096
- And there's another thing. - Yes. Yes, go on.

56:22.896 --> 56:27.725
The ones that differ aren't signed Torchia. They're signed LCF.

56:30.572 --> 56:32.381
- Still there? - LCF.

56:32.407 --> 56:33.796
Listen, where are you anyway?

56:33.897 --> 56:36.433
I must have that copy, Mr. Corso.

56:37.032 --> 56:38.322
Get it for me.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.905
The old man wouldn't sell it to save his life. He said as much.

56:43.191 --> 56:44.283
Did he?

56:46.012 --> 56:49.434
Hello? Hello?

57:21.189 --> 57:22.329
Just a minute!

57:41.451 --> 57:44.173
- What time is it? - Early, but you have to go.

57:45.565 --> 57:47.783
- Go? Go where? - To Fargas' place.

57:47.784 --> 57:49.262
I've already seen Fargas.

57:49.436 --> 57:50.784
I think you should see him again.

57:51.436 --> 57:53.811
What is this, some kind of practical joke? Who are you?

57:53.915 --> 57:57.637
- What do you know about Fargas? - Get dressed. I'll wait for you outside.

58:41.336 --> 58:43.815
Don't bother. He isn't there.

58:44.163 --> 58:47.468
- Oh really, then where is he? - Over there.

59:17.563 --> 59:19.042
God Almighty...

59:32.915 --> 59:34.524
You want to get inside?

59:35.438 --> 59:37.003
I had thought about it, yes.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.879
You wait here.

01:00:26.799 --> 01:00:27.582
Shit!

01:00:50.153 --> 01:00:51.849
Well, did you find it?

01:00:52.806 --> 01:00:56.067
You know, it's come to my attention that you know too goddam much.

01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:58.675
Why do you keep following me around? Who are you working for?

01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:01.459
You're wasting time asking all these questions. We better get out of here.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.634
There's a flight from Lisbon to Paris at noon. We should just make it.

01:01:04.852 --> 01:01:07.505
- What's with the "we"? - There are two of us, aren't there?

01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:09.071
What happened back there?

01:01:15.899 --> 01:01:18.377
The old man caught someone stealing, I guess.

01:01:19.116 --> 01:01:21.901
- And what do you guess happened to him? - He drowned.

01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:25.988
- With a little help from who? - He's dead, who cares?

01:01:25.989 --> 01:01:26.858
I do.

01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:29.989
I could easily end up the same way.

01:01:30.642 --> 01:01:32.773
Not with me around to look after you.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.209
- Oh I see, you're my guardian angel. - If you say so...

01:01:42.167 --> 01:01:46.124
- Someone is playing a game with me. - Of course, you're part of it.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.864
And you're getting to like it.

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:27.390
Keep the change.

01:02:36.694 --> 01:02:37.668
Hello Gruber.

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:41.234
Hello Mr. Corso. Delighted to see you again.

01:02:41.387 --> 01:02:43.770
We don't have any vacancies, but...

01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:47.236
I'm sure I'll be able to organise something.

01:02:50.819 --> 01:02:52.621
- Thank you very much. Please... - Thank you, sir.

01:03:46.632 --> 01:03:48.272
- Excuse me? - Good morning madam.

01:03:48.273 --> 01:03:49.962
The Kessler Foundation, please.

01:03:49.963 --> 01:03:51.652
- Second floor. - Thank you.

01:04:20.443 --> 01:04:21.486
Good afternoon.

01:04:22.053 --> 01:04:25.314
I'm Dean Corso, I have an appointment with Baroness Kessler.

01:04:30.663 --> 01:04:31.533
This way.

01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:43.144
You have thirty minutes.

01:04:48.842 --> 01:04:50.843
- Yes? - Monsieur Corso.

01:04:51.973 --> 01:04:54.713
Oh yes, Mr. Corso. Come in.

01:04:55.278 --> 01:04:57.105
I've heard a great deal about you.

01:04:58.801 --> 01:05:01.453
- Nothing good I hope. - You hoped right.

01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:02.671
Thanks, Simone.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.151
Well, I'm reassured, Baroness, because

01:05:05.412 --> 01:05:07.526
in my trade to be spoken well of

01:05:07.572 --> 01:05:10.275
can be professionally disastrous.

01:05:12.013 --> 01:05:12.938
My God.

01:05:12.978 --> 01:05:16.979
Yes, there it is. The Kessler Collection.

01:05:19.806 --> 01:05:21.633
You know I know your catalogue almost by heart?

01:05:21.747 --> 01:05:23.366
Strange we haven't met before.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.313
Your name is a byword among dealers and collectors.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:30.418
But I imagine you know your own reputation better than I do.

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:33.984
Yes, well it does keep the wolf from the door, so to speak.

01:05:34.071 --> 01:05:35.724
I'm sorry Baroness. Where you in the middle of something?

01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:37.636
Of my latest work:

01:05:37.638 --> 01:05:40.986
"The Devil, History and Myth". A kind of biography.

01:05:41.073 --> 01:05:43.596
It will be published early next year.

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:46.292
- Why the Devil? - I saw him one day.

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:50.597
I was 15 years old and I saw him as plain as I see you now.

01:05:50.598 --> 01:05:52.336
It was love at first sight.

01:05:52.337 --> 01:05:54.484
You know, 300 years ago

01:05:54.485 --> 01:05:56.719
you'd have been burned at the stake for saying something like that.

01:05:56.773 --> 01:05:59.208
300 years ago I wouldn't have said it.

01:05:59.773 --> 01:06:02.774
Nor would I have made a million by writing about it.

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:04.122
Yeah.

01:06:04.471 --> 01:06:07.384
What is it you wish to discuss, Mr. Corso?

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.907
There's a book in your collection I'd like to examine if possible.

01:06:11.124 --> 01:06:13.348
It's the book of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows".

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:16.381
The "Nine Gates"? An interesting work.

01:06:16.735 --> 01:06:18.953
Everyone's been asking me about it lately.

01:06:19.388 --> 01:06:20.127
Is that so?

01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:21.257
Follow me.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:27.781
You truly believe in the Devil, Baroness?

01:06:27.824 --> 01:06:31.347
Enough to devote my life and my library to him.

01:06:32.347 --> 01:06:34.652
Not to mention many years of work.

01:06:35.522 --> 01:06:36.392
Don't you?

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:38.045
Almost.

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:42.698
This book demands a certain amount of faith.

01:06:42.741 --> 01:06:45.525
Well, I'm afraid my faith's in short supply these days.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:49.569
I know this work extremely well. I studied it for years.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.439
Do you have any doubts about its authenticity?

01:06:52.874 --> 01:06:53.918
Not wheresoever.

01:06:54.048 --> 01:06:54.874
Are you sure?

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:57.397
My knowledge of this book is profound.

01:06:57.658 --> 01:06:59.355
I wrote a biography of its author.

01:06:59.572 --> 01:07:02.660
Yes, I read it: "Aristide Torchia, the Devil's Apprentice",

01:07:02.877 --> 01:07:03.704
Excellent work.

01:07:04.139 --> 01:07:05.704
A corageous man.

01:07:06.008 --> 01:07:10.314
He died for the sake of this very book in 1667.

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:13.056
While studying the Black Arts in Prague,

01:07:13.057 --> 01:07:16.098
he acquired a copy of the dread "Delomelanicon".

01:07:16.794 --> 01:07:19.142
This is Torchia's adaptation of that work

01:07:19.143 --> 01:07:21.490
which was written by Lucifer himself.

01:07:22.143 --> 01:07:24.709
After they burned him at the stake, a secret society

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:27.275
was founded, to perpetuate its memory,

01:07:27.362 --> 01:07:29.404
and preserve its secrets.

01:07:29.406 --> 01:07:32.102
"The Order of the Silver Serpent".

01:07:32.755 --> 01:07:33.798
What, a sect?

01:07:34.015 --> 01:07:36.102
A kind of witches' coven.

01:07:36.103 --> 01:07:39.148
For centuries they've met to read from this book

01:07:39.149 --> 01:07:41.322
and worship the Prince of Darkness.

01:07:41.714 --> 01:07:44.437
Today it's degenerated into a social club

01:07:44.438 --> 01:07:46.802
for bored millionaires and celebrities,

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:49.324
who use its meetings as an excuse

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:52.542
to indulge their jaded sexual appetites.

01:07:53.499 --> 01:07:55.152
I myself belonged to the Order,

01:07:55.934 --> 01:07:57.021
years ago.

01:07:57.022 --> 01:07:59.588
But time is too precious at my age

01:07:59.632 --> 01:08:02.415
besides my orgy days are over.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.023
I told them to go to the Devil.

01:08:06.111 --> 01:08:08.242
You mean it's all about sex or...

01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:09.286
Of course not.

01:08:09.765 --> 01:08:12.896
They're under the illusion that they owe their money and success

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:14.940
to membership in the Order.

01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:16.897
- Do they still meet? - Every year,

01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:19.115
on the anniversary of Torchia's death.

01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:21.332
They'll be meeting very soon now.

01:08:21.593 --> 01:08:24.158
- And you said they read from this book. - Not this one.

01:08:24.377 --> 01:08:28.508
I took mine back when Liana Telfer acquired the one in Toledo.

01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:30.742
Victor Fargas is an unbeliever,

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:35.424
he's always refused to partecipate so naturally they use the Telfer copy.

01:08:35.728 --> 01:08:37.424
Not that it has ever worked.

01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:39.640
Did Andrew Telfer ever take part?

01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:42.816
Telfer? Oh, no, no...

01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:46.948
That creature Liana, married him for his money.

01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:51.036
She comes from an old and aristocratic French family,

01:08:51.037 --> 01:08:53.384
The "De Saint-Martins", but they were penniless.

01:08:53.428 --> 01:08:57.081
So Liana used his dollars to restore her castle

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:59.167
and buy the "Nine Gates".

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:02.952
If he ever finds out what his wife gets up to at these gatherings

01:09:02.953 --> 01:09:04.691
he'll probably kill himself.

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:08.997
Funny you should say that, Baroness. He hung himself last week.

01:09:13.345 --> 01:09:16.825
Who exactly are you working for, Mr. Corso?

01:09:17.174 --> 01:09:19.566
My client's name is irrelevant, Baroness.

01:09:19.567 --> 01:09:21.957
I'm simply trying to authenticate his copy,

01:09:22.044 --> 01:09:24.261
just the one that Telfer sold him before he died.

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:27.654
How stupid of me! I should have guessed.

01:09:28.567 --> 01:09:32.395
You've out stage of welcome, Mr. Corso.

01:09:32.656 --> 01:09:35.134
I was hoping to examine your copy in detail.

01:09:35.221 --> 01:09:36.395
Certainly not.

01:09:37.352 --> 01:09:40.223
Tell your client, who can only be Boris Balkan,

01:09:40.224 --> 01:09:43.919
to come and examinate himself, if he dares.

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:48.486
Tell him not to send any more wolves in sheep clothing.

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.531
Now kindly leave.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.280
Well, I'm sorry if I troubled you.

01:09:59.385 --> 01:10:00.689
Thank you very much for your time.

01:10:00.793 --> 01:10:03.620
You don't know what you're getting yourself into, Mr. Corso.

01:10:05.317 --> 01:10:07.491
Get out before it's too late.

01:10:08.274 --> 01:10:11.796
I'm afraid it already is, Baroness. Good day.

01:11:26.555 --> 01:11:27.599
Thanks.

01:14:03.988 --> 01:14:05.031
They're broken.

01:14:06.728 --> 01:14:08.685
You should be more careful.

01:14:24.298 --> 01:14:27.516
- I need a favour, Gruber. - Certainly, Mr. Corso.

01:14:27.733 --> 01:14:29.299
Liana Telfer,

01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:33.605
Maiden name De Saint-Martin, 40ish, brunette, dishy,

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:36.214
probably accompanied by

01:14:38.345 --> 01:14:41.128
a black gentleman with

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:43.215
closely cropped

01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:46.805
platinum blonde hair, and a moustache.

01:14:46.999 --> 01:14:49.435
I wanna know if they're staying in some hotel here in Paris.

01:14:49.522 --> 01:14:50.484
It'll take a little time...

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:53.348
Yes, of course. Start with the "Five Stars". That's your best bet.

01:14:53.610 --> 01:14:55.349
- Very well sir. - Alright.

01:14:55.516 --> 01:14:56.929
Are you feeling alright?

01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:00.698
I've felt better, Gruber. Thanks.

01:15:01.438 --> 01:15:03.439
Let me know if you locate.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:18.094
Put this

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:21.617
against the back of your neck.

01:15:33.968 --> 01:15:36.404
You were really great on there by the river.

01:15:36.904 --> 01:15:38.990
I haven't thanked you for that.

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.021
Alright. Look...

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.840
I think it's about time you told me what's going on here.

01:16:26.612 --> 01:16:29.157
- Someone's after your book. - No kidding.

01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:31.179
And you? what do you feed into it?

01:16:40.558 --> 01:16:41.352
Yeah?

01:16:47.008 --> 01:16:49.053
Can I take it in the reception please?

01:16:50.662 --> 01:16:52.452
Alright. I'll be right down.

01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:08.550
- Yes? - Anything new?

01:17:09.015 --> 01:17:11.145
Oh, His Master's voice again.

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:12.870
No, not much,

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:16.447
aside from the fact somene has tried to take my life a couple of times

01:17:17.277 --> 01:17:20.104
Oh yes. Fargas has been murdered.

01:17:22.192 --> 01:17:24.471
Murdered? How do you know?

01:17:24.825 --> 01:17:26.761
I saw him. And his copy.

01:17:26.916 --> 01:17:29.063
Or what was left of it anyway.

01:17:29.455 --> 01:17:32.891
Someone had snatched the engravings and tried to burn the rest.

01:17:33.238 --> 01:17:36.552
- What do you make of it? - It's tragic, it's tragic...

01:17:36.804 --> 01:17:39.592
What about Baroness Kessler? How did you get on today?

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:42.809
- Where exactly are you? - What about her copy?

01:17:42.936 --> 01:17:47.509
No, why do I get the impression that you've been breathing down my neck the entire time?

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:51.846
You're an investment of mine, Mr. Corso. I'm really looking after it.

01:17:55.114 --> 01:17:57.519
The old woman swears her copy's authentic.

01:17:57.679 --> 01:17:59.810
But I didn't get the chance to examine it closely.

01:18:00.506 --> 01:18:03.985
She threw me out as soon as she guessed that you were behind my visit.

01:18:04.725 --> 01:18:07.421
You're not exactly in her good books, if you know what I mean.

01:18:07.856 --> 01:18:09.323
You must see her again.

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.510
Are you kidding? Have you seen her secretary?

01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:13.698
Try the launch break.

01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:17.026
Hello?

01:18:45.991 --> 01:18:49.707
- Do you have a photocopy machine back there? - Yes sir.

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:52.971
- Can I use it? - Of course, sir.

01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:58.102
Thank you.

01:21:51.272 --> 01:21:55.307
Yes. Hello, Baroness. It's me, the wolf in sheep's clothing.

01:21:56.003 --> 01:21:59.873
I thought I made myself bright clear, Mr. Corso.

01:22:00.073 --> 01:22:00.895
Well...

01:22:01.961 --> 01:22:04.310
I've got something for you, Baroness.

01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:08.448
Kind of peace offering. Will you allow me to give it to you?

01:22:09.134 --> 01:22:10.261
Please?

01:22:36.666 --> 01:22:38.406
First let me apologise.

01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:41.841
I should have told you right away that I work for Boris Balkan.

01:22:42.711 --> 01:22:46.778
It was foolish of me to think that I could deceive someone as astute as yourself, so

01:22:46.886 --> 01:22:47.993
please forgive me.

01:22:48.104 --> 01:22:51.105
Flattering will get you nowhere, Mr. Corso.

01:22:51.974 --> 01:22:53.236
Get on with it.

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:54.744
Right.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.154
These

01:23:00.107 --> 01:23:01.413
are for you.

01:23:03.977 --> 01:23:05.325
What is this?

01:23:05.934 --> 01:23:07.849
What is this supposed to be?

01:23:08.805 --> 01:23:12.765
You said that your knowledge of "The Nine Gates" was extensive, but

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.366
did you ever compare your copy with the other two?

01:23:15.521 --> 01:23:16.514
No.

01:23:17.207 --> 01:23:18.041
Why?

01:23:18.136 --> 01:23:19.700
Well, you should.

01:23:20.242 --> 01:23:23.267
These are copies of the engravings in Balkan's book.

01:23:23.983 --> 01:23:27.416
- You'll find that some of them differ from yours. - Differ?

01:23:28.854 --> 01:23:32.138
So you question my book's authenticity, do you?

01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:35.612
It that's your peace offering you can take it and go.

01:23:35.682 --> 01:23:37.926
Mine "Nine Gates" is absolutely genuine.

01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:39.770
I don't dispute that, Baroness.

01:23:39.901 --> 01:23:42.684
In my opinion all three copies are genuine.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.292
But the fact remains they display variations.

01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:46.945
Variations?

01:23:48.076 --> 01:23:51.034
If that were true it would be a revelation.

01:23:51.512 --> 01:23:53.164
What makes you so sure?

01:23:54.774 --> 01:23:57.255
I've already compared these with the Fargas engravings.

01:23:58.035 --> 01:23:59.209
In his book

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.993
th keys were in the other hand.

01:24:05.167 --> 01:24:08.125
Here the doorway wasn't bricked up.

01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:12.882
And in this one the man was hanging by the other leg.

01:24:29.609 --> 01:24:32.239
- Well? - Well what?

01:24:35.176 --> 01:24:37.480
Look closely, Baroness.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.960
The turrets.

01:24:40.264 --> 01:24:43.743
Three in yours, four in Balkan's.

01:24:55.964 --> 01:24:56.920
Amazing.

01:24:57.834 --> 01:25:00.747
I'm convinced there'll be a third one in here somewhere.

01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:04.749
Three variations in three copies makes nine.

01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:07.639
Coincidence or something more.

01:25:08.358 --> 01:25:12.402
Maybe Torchia hid the secret of "The Nine Gates" in three books, not one.

01:25:14.794 --> 01:25:16.926
I must admit I'm impressed.

01:25:17.144 --> 01:25:20.499
This puts an entirely different complexion on the matter.

01:25:21.187 --> 01:25:24.885
You have my permission to investigate further, Mr. Corso.

01:25:25.406 --> 01:25:27.450
Take as long as you need.

01:25:43.237 --> 01:25:47.273
My permission did not extend to that, Mr. Corso.

01:25:48.108 --> 01:25:50.993
Nobody smokes in my library.

01:28:35.133 --> 01:28:35.994
Baroness?

01:29:26.647 --> 01:29:27.679
Idiot!

01:31:24.066 --> 01:31:26.958
Excuse me. There's something missing from my room.

01:31:27.153 --> 01:31:30.502
- Has anyone been up there while I was out? - Only your wife, sir.

01:31:31.198 --> 01:31:32.981
My wife? I don't have a wife!

01:31:33.757 --> 01:31:34.573
Excuse me sir.

01:31:35.286 --> 01:31:37.809
Yes? Yes, he's in front of me.

01:31:38.461 --> 01:31:39.418
Alright.

01:31:39.678 --> 01:31:41.940
For you sir. Booth nomber two.

01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:48.300
Yes?

01:31:48.616 --> 01:31:49.725
What news?

01:31:51.986 --> 01:31:52.943
News?

01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:55.727
Let me see... Well,

01:31:56.378 --> 01:32:00.423
yes, the good news is that I got to examine the old woman's book.

01:32:01.076 --> 01:32:03.380
and three of her engravings were signed LCF.

01:32:03.598 --> 01:32:06.381
The bad news is that someone strangled her

01:32:06.685 --> 01:32:09.774
and made a bonfire of her collection. Now that's tragic, wouldn't you say?

01:32:10.367 --> 01:32:12.035
You put the words out of my mouth.

01:32:12.643 --> 01:32:15.732
Yes. It's the Fargas story all over again.

01:32:15.949 --> 01:32:19.994
I'm of the mind that they tore out the engravings before they torched the place.

01:32:20.385 --> 01:32:22.081
That makes two sets they've got.

01:32:22.255 --> 01:32:23.560
And my copy?

01:32:24.517 --> 01:32:27.300
Well, I learnt my lesson fortunately.

01:32:27.518 --> 01:32:29.704
I don't carry it around with me anymore

01:32:30.053 --> 01:32:31.953
Otherwise it would have gone up in smoke.

01:32:32.551 --> 01:32:34.706
Excellent. Good thinking.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:38.607
Well, with the two copies gone that seems to conclude your assignment.

01:32:38.825 --> 01:32:40.912
It only remains of you to return my book.

01:32:41.129 --> 01:32:44.032
I'm staying at the Ritz. You can pick up your check at the same time.

01:32:44.223 --> 01:32:46.244
Shall we say in half an hour?

01:32:48.045 --> 01:32:50.002
There is more bad news.

01:32:52.176 --> 01:32:54.532
- I don't have it. - You don't have it?

01:32:55.676 --> 01:32:57.525
Someone lifted it from my room.

01:33:02.055 --> 01:33:04.658
Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Corso.

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.571
I think you may already have some idea

01:33:08.789 --> 01:33:12.355
of the length at which I'm prepared to go when I want something.

01:33:13.747 --> 01:33:18.053
Unless you recuperate my property in double-quick time

01:33:19.212 --> 01:33:22.488
you'll discover just how far that can be.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.450
Where is it?

01:33:35.451 --> 01:33:37.231
- Where is what? - The book. Where is it?

01:33:37.902 --> 01:33:40.319
Would I be here if I took it?

01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:42.233
You should know better by now.

01:33:48.278 --> 01:33:50.960
I must apologise on my young colleague, Mr. Corso

01:33:50.961 --> 01:33:52.679
Was unpardonable.

01:33:53.018 --> 01:33:54.236
Is that her?

01:33:54.931 --> 01:33:59.106
No sir, she was tall, dark hair, very chic, very elegant.

01:33:59.116 --> 01:34:02.104
Which reminds me sir, I have the information you wanted.

01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:04.337
The lady and gentleman you mentioned

01:34:04.544 --> 01:34:07.771
they're staying at the Plaza Athen?Hotel

01:34:07.979 --> 01:34:10.841
suite 209-211.

01:34:11.562 --> 01:34:14.873
Thank you very much Gruber, I owe you one. I need a taxi, quick.

01:34:14.874 --> 01:34:16.352
A taxi, quick.

01:34:18.025 --> 01:34:22.116
Send this to Mr. Balkan at the Ritz. it's B-A-L-K-A-N.

01:34:24.809 --> 01:34:27.381
- Fax it immediately. - Certainly, sir.

01:34:29.419 --> 01:34:31.594
It was a pleasure to be at your service.

01:34:31.855 --> 01:34:32.768
Ain't coming?

01:34:53.202 --> 01:34:54.904
What do you plan to do if you see them?

01:34:55.208 --> 01:34:57.296
Probably hide behind you.

01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:53.093
Oh, that's them.

01:35:56.531 --> 01:35:58.747
We should grab a taxi before they take off.

01:36:00.198 --> 01:36:01.197
Let's go.

01:36:19.225 --> 01:36:20.361
They're going.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:54.979
Coming?

01:37:06.764 --> 01:37:08.748
Couldn't you have picked something a little less conspicuous?

01:37:08.852 --> 01:37:10.461
Don't be so picky.

01:37:10.635 --> 01:37:13.071
Some people would give their eyeteeth for driving this.

01:37:50.254 --> 01:37:53.212
Listen we can't sit on their tail forever, they'll bound and smell a rat.

01:38:18.044 --> 01:38:19.262
How do I look?

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:22.219
Ridiculous.

01:38:30.874 --> 01:38:32.092
Sit tight.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.470
Take your pick.

01:39:23.789 --> 01:39:26.198
No, you. You know everything.

01:39:26.256 --> 01:39:27.518
If you say so...

01:39:41.696 --> 01:39:43.102
We lost them.

01:39:43.459 --> 01:39:44.850
No, not at that speed.

01:39:45.623 --> 01:39:47.073
They must have gone the other way.

01:39:47.223 --> 01:39:49.101
You mean I don't know everything after all?

01:39:50.371 --> 01:39:51.410
Turn around.

01:40:05.352 --> 01:40:07.552
30ish, brunette, dishy?

01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:10.639
- What was her name again? - Telfer, Liana Telfer.

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.378
No, her maiden name.

01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:16.141
- Saint-Martin. - Look.

01:40:57.767 --> 01:40:58.667
Excuse me?

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:05.223
We're looking for the house of Madame De Saint-Martin.

01:41:05.262 --> 01:41:06.635
The castle you mean?

01:41:06.654 --> 01:41:07.915
The castle, I knew that.

01:41:09.177 --> 01:41:10.659
Where's the castle?

01:41:10.892 --> 01:41:12.895
Take the road behind the Church there.

01:41:15.171 --> 01:41:16.769
- Thanks. - Not at all.

01:41:31.821 --> 01:41:32.675
Keep going.

01:41:36.472 --> 01:41:37.325
Keep going.

01:43:56.076 --> 01:43:57.145
See them anywhere?

01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:02.393
No.

01:45:31.506 --> 01:45:33.159
Sorry to have to intrude on you like this.

01:45:33.199 --> 01:45:34.770
What are you doing here?

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:39.035
I jumped like to pick up the book you stole from my room.

01:45:39.036 --> 01:45:41.901
- That book is mine. - We've been through all this before.

01:45:42.948 --> 01:45:44.610
My husband gave it to me.

01:45:44.788 --> 01:45:46.387
It wasn't his to sell.

01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:47.818
He sold it to get back at you?

01:45:47.819 --> 01:45:49.762
What happened? Did he catch you with that albino?

01:45:49.763 --> 01:45:50.772
How dare you?

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:52.882
Keep an eye on her.

01:45:54.779 --> 01:45:55.549
Don't!

01:45:56.389 --> 01:45:57.482
Be careful, she bites.

01:46:09.677 --> 01:46:10.518
Hi.

01:46:14.344 --> 01:46:17.357
Don't move! Either one of you.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.041
Get the book.

01:46:34.467 --> 01:46:36.678
Don't kill them up here, you'll make a mess.

01:46:37.288 --> 01:46:38.766
Take them downstairs.

01:46:40.299 --> 01:46:41.297
You'll go first.

01:46:41.986 --> 01:46:42.792
Then you.

01:46:55.902 --> 01:46:56.729
Down.

01:47:11.993 --> 01:47:13.211
Open the door.

01:47:26.475 --> 01:47:27.476
Watch out!

01:47:45.585 --> 01:47:47.677
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:56.350
Eight Gates preceed the Serpent who guards the Word.

01:47:56.351 --> 01:48:00.261
We give loyalty to you, Lord.

01:48:00.262 --> 01:48:04.316
We devoted our bodies and souls to you.

01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:08.559
The Serpent is a beast that never sleeps.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.237
A beast whose eyes can see through the mirror of science.

01:48:14.293 --> 01:48:17.813
We give loyalty to you, Lord. We...

01:48:18.794 --> 01:48:21.925
Stay here and cover me. I'm going down.

01:48:22.079 --> 01:48:28.263
We won't be afraid of the noose, or the blade, or the poison.

01:48:28.264 --> 01:48:31.400
We give loyalty to you, Lord.

01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:35.884
We devoted our bodies and souls to you.

01:48:36.666 --> 01:48:41.879
We'll walk intact through the lepers and the plague.

01:48:42.028 --> 01:48:45.021
We give loyalty to you, Lord.

01:48:45.319 --> 01:48:49.089
We devoted our bodies and souls to you.

01:48:49.203 --> 01:48:52.756
The last hidden one behind which is the Word

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.244
is the Ninth one. Teth, Enneae, Oded.

01:48:57.561 --> 01:49:00.670
We give loyalty to you, Lord.

01:49:00.914 --> 01:49:04.917
We devoted our bodies and souls to you.

01:49:04.993 --> 01:49:10.233
- Glory to  Eloy, Agla, Zate... - Mambo Jambo! Mambo Jambo!

01:49:18.462 --> 01:49:20.724
Look around you, all of you. What do you see?

01:49:21.506 --> 01:49:24.876
A bunch of buffoons in fancy dress.

01:49:25.608 --> 01:49:27.421
Do you think the Prince of Darkness would actually

01:49:27.422 --> 01:49:29.042
deign to manifest himself

01:49:29.074 --> 01:49:32.422
before the lights of you? He never has and he never will. Never.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.075
You read from his book,

01:49:36.466 --> 01:49:39.554
but you have no conception of its true power.

01:49:40.143 --> 01:49:42.120
I alone have grasped its secret,

01:49:42.294 --> 01:49:45.467
I alone have fathomed the Master's grand design.

01:49:45.681 --> 01:49:48.301
I alone am worthy to enjoy the fruits

01:49:48.588 --> 01:49:53.080
of that discovery: absolute power to determine my own destiny.

01:49:53.081 --> 01:49:54.983
You're insane, Boris. Give it back to me!

01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:58.437
You, Liana de Saint-Martin,

01:49:58.994 --> 01:50:01.603
you're even guiltier than the rest of this pathetic rabble.

01:50:02.168 --> 01:50:05.643
You have at least some idea of what this book can do in the right hands.

01:50:05.727 --> 01:50:09.167
Yet you grant yourself to this farsical proceedings,

01:50:09.168 --> 01:50:11.065
to these orgies of aging flesh

01:50:11.066 --> 01:50:14.258
conducted in the Master's name. You're a charlatan!

01:50:41.834 --> 01:50:43.870
Don't Corso, don't!

01:50:53.269 --> 01:50:54.618
Let it be.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.931
What is it with you?

01:51:30.192 --> 01:51:33.409
He just murdered someone in public. You're off the hook

01:51:33.756 --> 01:51:36.492
for the other killings. You should be grateful.

01:51:36.628 --> 01:51:37.584
I'm ecstatic!

01:51:37.802 --> 01:51:39.369
You're out of the job, it's over.

01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:41.368
- What more do you want? - You know what.

01:51:45.254 --> 01:51:46.259
Wait for me!

01:52:08.064 --> 01:52:09.988
Not taking me for a ride?

01:52:10.489 --> 01:52:12.233
You were working for him all along.

01:52:12.308 --> 01:52:14.165
Funny, I thought you were.

01:53:01.158 --> 01:53:02.246
Shit!

01:54:43.416 --> 01:54:45.798
- Here you are sir. All's dry. - Thanks madam.

01:54:47.352 --> 01:54:49.030
- Excuse me? - Yes?

01:54:51.462 --> 01:54:53.072
Where is that?

01:54:56.115 --> 01:54:58.421
Bernard I need you to show something to...

01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:08.849
Here it is.

01:57:13.804 --> 01:57:16.805
Yes, that's it.

01:57:21.632 --> 01:57:23.589
Exactly.

01:57:24.728 --> 01:57:27.037
One,

01:57:27.217 --> 01:57:28.183
four,

01:57:28.459 --> 01:57:29.224
three,

01:57:30.286 --> 01:57:31.461
six,

01:57:32.026 --> 01:57:33.244
seven,

01:57:33.766 --> 01:57:35.027
five,

01:57:35.375 --> 01:57:38.550
eight, two, nine.

01:57:40.028 --> 01:57:42.952
The enigma is solved at last.

01:57:44.318 --> 01:57:48.422
"To travel in silence by a long, unsecured road

01:57:48.639 --> 01:57:53.076
to brave the arrows of misfortune and fear neither noose or fire,

01:57:53.292 --> 01:57:55.718
to play the greatest of all games and win,

01:57:55.774 --> 01:57:58.044
forgoing no expense

01:57:58.472 --> 01:58:00.138
is to walk the vicissitudes of Fate

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:01.842
and gain at last the key

01:58:02.588 --> 01:58:07.418
that will unlock the Ninth Gate ".

01:58:12.871 --> 01:58:13.713
Corso?

01:58:14.385 --> 01:58:17.125
What were you expecting? An apparition?

01:58:18.836 --> 01:58:21.700
You're not wanted here Mr. Corso. Leave.

01:58:22.677 --> 01:58:25.263
I'm the only apparition you'll see tonight.

01:58:26.088 --> 01:58:28.264
You'll find a check waiting in my New York office,

01:58:28.496 --> 01:58:29.751
payment in full.

01:58:30.608 --> 01:58:33.825
You've killed for those. They're worth more than money.

01:58:34.043 --> 01:58:37.874
Infinitely more, but they happen to be mine,

01:58:38.087 --> 01:58:39.072
not yours.

01:58:41.044 --> 01:58:42.958
Do you know something, Corso?

01:58:44.045 --> 01:58:45.872
In spite of our differences

01:58:46.611 --> 01:58:48.699
I have a sort of bug for you.

01:58:49.138 --> 01:58:51.855
- I'm touched. - We have something in common, you and I.

01:58:52.336 --> 01:58:56.703
We share the same passion. You've developed the same obsession, haven't you?

01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:01.188
Unfortunately for you only one of us is destined to fulfil it.

01:59:01.239 --> 01:59:03.965
You're out of your depth. Kindly go.

01:59:05.051 --> 01:59:08.530
- I'm not leaving here empty handed. - Don't even think about it.

01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:11.428
Stand aside.

01:59:12.618 --> 01:59:14.415
I credited you with more finesse.

01:59:14.671 --> 01:59:17.635
- You heard me? Stand back! - Put that away, it's not your style.

01:59:17.749 --> 01:59:18.822
Don't come near!

01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:43.365
Seems you found your proper niche at last.

01:59:44.107 --> 01:59:45.009
I like that.

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:47.279
Now,

01:59:48.947 --> 01:59:50.585
you can watch.

01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:01.892
I'm entering an uncharted territory.

02:00:02.332 --> 02:00:07.067
taking the road that leads to equality with God.

02:00:22.984 --> 02:00:26.420
You can't come with me. I must travel alone.

02:00:26.637 --> 02:00:30.421
But you may look on me and marvel.

02:00:30.682 --> 02:00:33.726
- That's very kind of you. - Indeed it is.

02:00:36.857 --> 02:00:39.815
There have been men who have been burned alive

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:43.250
or disembowelled for just a glimpse

02:00:43.686 --> 02:00:47.991
of what you are about to witness.

02:00:56.079 --> 02:00:58.341
I give you my allegiance, Master.

02:00:58.733 --> 02:01:01.386
I pledge myself to you body and soul.

02:01:01.603 --> 02:01:05.038
Let me fear neither noose, nor fire nor poison.

02:01:05.256 --> 02:01:09.388
Erase me from the Book of Life, inscribe me in the Black Book of Death.

02:01:09.605 --> 02:01:12.779
Admit me to the Ninth Gate.

02:01:12.997 --> 02:01:14.432
Let it be so.

02:01:17.521 --> 02:01:20.217
Let it be so now!

02:01:34.916 --> 02:01:38.656
I feel the power surge through me like an electric current,

02:01:38.873 --> 02:01:40.917
rendering me capable of any feat

02:01:40.918 --> 02:01:42.473
of mind or body.

02:01:42.613 --> 02:01:45.737
I'm invulnerable, I'm invincible!

02:01:47.876 --> 02:01:51.660
I can float on air, I can walk on water.

02:01:57.700 --> 02:01:59.662
I'm plunging my hands in fire,

02:02:00.010 --> 02:02:01.314
I feel no heat!

02:02:02.272 --> 02:02:04.141
This is great, here's another one.

02:02:16.522 --> 02:02:22.571
Sic dedo me. Sic exeo me! Sic damno me!

02:02:25.234 --> 02:02:27.060
It's miraculous!

02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:30.365
I feel nothing, nothing at all!

02:05:41.199 --> 02:05:42.329
Is that it?

02:05:43.764 --> 02:05:45.069
Is the game over?

02:05:45.721 --> 02:05:48.418
For Balkan yes. Not for you.

02:05:48.435 --> 02:05:50.258
Why didn't it work for Balkan?

02:05:50.326 --> 02:05:52.636
The ninth engraving was a forgery.

02:05:56.116 --> 02:05:57.377
Where is the real one?

02:05:59.678 --> 02:06:00.824
I want it.

02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:05.466
You're running low in gas.

02:07:37.889 --> 02:07:42.511
- Hello. Ceniza brothers. - Sorry?

02:07:43.113 --> 02:07:48.227
- Ceniza brothers? - Pepe Lopez. Ricardo Herrera.

02:07:49.018 --> 02:07:49.873
Sure...

02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:53.253
Do you speak English?
