00:06.089 --> 00:07.507
[tense music playing]

00:07.590 --> 00:10.468
[Diane] Have you ever heard
of Night Action? You shouldn't have.

00:10.552 --> 00:14.097
Night Action is a top-secret
investigative program within the FBI.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.224
The operatives who conduct
those investigations

00:16.307 --> 00:17.684
are known simply as night agents.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.269
So you want me to be a night agent?

00:19.352 --> 00:21.229
I want you to answer the phone for them.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.523
[Diane] You put your time in
in that hellhole of a room,

00:23.606 --> 00:26.443
manning a phone that never rings,
and better things will come your way.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.570
Someone is outside.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.572
Call this number, say "Night Action."

[phone ringing]

00:41.249 --> 00:43.084
-Uh, yes, go ahead.
-Night Action.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.420
-Code, please.
-Pen. Clock. Door. Fire.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.298
It's gonna be all right. I answer
the phone for night agents in distress.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.008
By agents, you mean spies?

00:50.091 --> 00:52.761
My orders are to protect you
with my life, and I will do that.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.804
[gunshots]

00:54.888 --> 00:55.722
[Peter] Rose!

00:56.639 --> 00:58.850
Do you remember the first time
when I called Night Action?

00:58.933 --> 01:00.477
You told me to fight like hell.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.978
And that's what I need you to do.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.022
They're preparing another attack.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.150
We know you're planning
on killing the president at Camp David.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.569
[helicopter engine whirring]

01:12.072 --> 01:14.115
-It's rigged to blow on liftoff!
-Drop it!

01:14.199 --> 01:15.200
-No!
-Kill the engines!

01:19.746 --> 01:21.498
[soldier] Stay down! Stay down!

01:21.581 --> 01:22.707
Peter! [panting]

01:22.791 --> 01:25.085
[Michelle] You've been wasting away
in the basement.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.295
How would you like to be a night agent?

01:27.378 --> 01:30.256
-I think I wanna go back to California.
-With your company?

01:30.340 --> 01:33.051
New name, new start.
Learn from my mistakes.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.385
Call me when you get there.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.930
I don't know when it'll be,
but I promise I'm gonna call you.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.731

[indistinct chatter in Thai]

02:00.537 --> 02:02.539
[piano music playing]

02:05.083 --> 02:06.709
[man] I look forward to hearing
about that.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.838
Or you can take it as an aggression upon…
You know what I'm saying?

02:09.921 --> 02:12.507
[woman] I can't believe
you're making this, like, make sense, man.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.384
I'm just trying to, like… [chuckling]

02:14.467 --> 02:17.929
-[woman chuckling] Right, rationalize.
-Yeah, I'm like that. I say dumb stuff.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.056
I know, I've noticed. [chuckling]

02:20.140 --> 02:21.391
-You ready?
-Yeah.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.308
Okay.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.727
[Peter] No, we gotta get back
on what we were talking about.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.563
[woman chuckling] Absolutely not.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.400
-[saleswoman] This one very good.
-You never finished your story.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.777
-Oh right, about the bet.
-Yeah.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.197
So, what this guy didn't know
was that back in the day,

02:36.281 --> 02:39.284
I was Wichita City Bowling Champion,
12-and-under division.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.326
Oh, impressive.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.745
Mm-hmm. So the sucker took the bet.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.706
But what I didn't know

02:44.789 --> 02:49.252
was that he was Tennessee State
Bowling Champ, adult division.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.213
-So, I took the bet.
-And you turned out to be the sucker.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.464
Oh, a royal one.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.093
But that's how I ended up
with a Shrek tattoo on my lower back.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.761
-Wow, classy.
-[woman] Mm.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.390
What's going on? He spot us?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.684
No, not yet, but he's checking for tails.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.103
-Just keep up the honeymooners act.
-Okay.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.189
[tense music playing]

03:12.859 --> 03:14.527
[indistinct chatter]

03:16.404 --> 03:18.114
[woman] Your collar is all frayed.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.200
Someone really needs to take you shopping.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.368
-You dress like you're single.
-I am single.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.787
Well, that shirt is a good way
to perpetually stay that way.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.457
-Tell me a joke.
-A joke?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.792
For his benefit.
Tell me a joke. Make me laugh.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.878
Knock, knock.

03:32.795 --> 03:33.630
Who's there?

03:34.672 --> 03:36.674
[chuckling] I got… I got nothing.
I'm sorry.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.051
[chuckling]

03:39.636 --> 03:42.096
-He's moving.
-Okay, let's give him a little space.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.682
We don't wanna spook him
before we know what he's up to.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.560
[suspenseful music playing]

03:50.104 --> 03:52.690
He's not acting like someone
who's just out for a stroll.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.734
He's acting like someone
who trained at The Farm.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.278
-[Peter] Think he's our guy?
-[woman] He's acting like our guy.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.030
If he really is the leaker…

03:59.113 --> 04:01.366
He could be getting ready
to pass some more intel.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.326
There's only one way to find out.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.120
[indistinct chatter]

04:16.589 --> 04:18.258
He's about to meet someone.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.803
-How can you be sure?
-Men always have tells. Even you.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.183
What's my tell?

04:47.745 --> 04:49.747
[inaudible]

04:54.627 --> 04:56.045
They exchange anything?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.006
I don't know. Couldn't see a handoff.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.011
You recognize him?

05:04.721 --> 05:06.556
-No.
-Yeah, shit, I don't either.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.391
Okay, go. Comms on.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.521
I'm gonna take the new guy,
you take Warren.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.106
-Be careful.
-You be careful.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.941
Remember the training,
remember the mission.

05:17.025 --> 05:17.900
Yes, ma'am.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.569
[scoffing] Still with the "ma'ams."

05:19.652 --> 05:21.946

-Yeah.

[bus hissing]

06:26.386 --> 06:28.221
He just made a drop.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.515
[woman] Okay, I'll ditch this guy,
and I'll come meet you.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.683
Where are you?

06:33.684 --> 06:34.519
One second.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.209
-Somebody just picked it up.
-[woman] Who?

06:58.292 --> 07:00.336
[Peter] I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.506
-Looked like a thumb drive.
-[woman] Okay, don't lose him.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.851
[car horn honking]

07:36.247 --> 07:38.291
Peter, what's going on?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.128
I'm still following the new guy
with the thumb drive.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.172
[woman] Where are you?

07:44.797 --> 07:45.756
Sathorn Road.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.926
That place we had lunch
that one time with the bad oysters.

[onlookers chattering]

08:55.284 --> 08:56.369
Okay, I'm here.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.537
What the fuck?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.497
-How did we get burned?
-I don't know.

[breathing heavily]

09:01.207 --> 09:02.041
You okay?

09:02.124 --> 09:04.794
Yeah. Night Action
has an extraction point for us.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.796
-Where?
-They're sending a helicopter.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.798
Rama VIII Park. You know where that is?

09:08.881 --> 09:09.715
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

This is Copperhead?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.385

10:36.969 --> 10:39.347
I'm in a warehouse near Rama VIII Park.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.807
I got at least three people
still following me.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.309
Extraction's five minutes out.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.020

Put me through to Reindeer, now.

-Come on.
-[woman] Peter, are you there?

11:02.286 --> 11:04.246
They knew where our extraction point was.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.539
[woman] I can't hear you.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.793
The fucking extraction point.
They were waiting for us.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.504
-Why did you need an extraction?
-[Peter] Somebody tipped them off.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.714
-Okay? They knew.
-[woman] Knew what?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.632
Everything.

11:14.715 --> 11:18.636
Listen, Catherine, figure out who else
knew about this mission but you

11:18.719 --> 11:20.012
because somebody gave us up.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.223
Are you and Alice okay?

11:23.641 --> 11:24.767
Alice is dead.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.687
What?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.523
She's gone.

you've made progress?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.252
[woman] Therapy isn't a race, Rose.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.504
It takes time to process trauma.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.841
The nightmares have stopped, right?

14:02.675 --> 14:05.135
Not completely,
but I've been doing the work.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.096
I'm staying out of stressful situations,

14:07.179 --> 14:09.306
I do yoga, I journal my feelings, so…

14:11.642 --> 14:13.686
when does the anxiety stop?

14:15.437 --> 14:18.148
I… I just wanna feel like me again.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.650
Even after all these months,

14:19.733 --> 14:21.944
there are still things
you won't open up about.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.154
It's not how this is supposed to work.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.782
Some things I can't get into.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.784
[woman] I'd like to suggest something.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.620
Have you heard of EMDR therapy?

14:32.454 --> 14:34.957
It's a new kind of therapy
and not without its critics,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.626
but I think you might be a good candidate.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.129
It would involve talking to someone else--

14:40.212 --> 14:41.338
Wait. [scoffing]

14:42.590 --> 14:45.175
Are you firing me as one of your patients?

14:45.926 --> 14:48.971
EMDR requires special training.
Training I don't have.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.057
It also requires you being able
to let your guard down,

14:52.141 --> 14:55.019
at least more than
you've been able to do with me.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.521
[Rose inhaling deeply, exhaling]

14:57.605 --> 14:59.607
[dramatic music playing]

15:01.525 --> 15:03.277
[Rose] Okay. [clearing throat]

15:03.360 --> 15:06.697
We believe we've done something
revolutionary with AdVerse.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.033
Our proprietary algorithm
makes connections

15:09.116 --> 15:10.951
that no other company can make.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.202
[cell phone vibrating]

15:13.746 --> 15:14.747
[man] I'm listening.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.502
[Rose] You had your picture taken
at security about 15 years ago.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.214
I'm sorry, um, 15 minutes ago.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.341
Right.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.092
[Rose] AdVerse can take that picture,

15:27.176 --> 15:30.054
run it through various
social media applications,

15:30.137 --> 15:33.057
-ID you…
-[cell phone vibrating]

15:34.683 --> 15:37.311
…cross-check it against, um…

15:38.228 --> 15:39.063
Against…

15:39.146 --> 15:44.234
What my lead programmer is trying to say
is AdVerse uses a picture or a name

15:44.318 --> 15:46.987
to create a precise advertising profile

15:47.071 --> 15:49.490
based off online searches
of their shopping accounts,

15:49.573 --> 15:51.158
their product reviews, hobbies…

15:51.241 --> 15:53.869
-Other companies do that.
-They're not as good as AdVerse.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.830
[man scoffing] And for $50 million,
I should just take your word for it?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.165
AdVerse is better.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.585
Our customer profiles
are deeper, more accurate.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
Companies will pay a fortune
to sort through them

16:04.129 --> 16:06.674
and precisely target
their most likely customers.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.134
Do you have any agreements
with any of these companies?

16:09.218 --> 16:12.471
No, we use publicly available data
in each of these cases.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.098
I don't know.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.516
It's a tough sector to invest in.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.434
There's a lot of smart people
chasing this.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.269
Even if yours is better.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.229
[cell phone vibrating]

16:20.312 --> 16:22.231
[man] I'm not crazy
about the marketing application.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.650
The raw data you're mining
is interesting though.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.277
What other things do you think
you might be able to do with it?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.279
Uh, excuse me a minute.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.990
[cell phone continues vibrating]

16:31.073 --> 16:33.367
I'm sorry about Rose.
She's not herself today.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.911
Engineers. We've all been there.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.830
-[indistinct chatter]
-[door closing]

16:37.913 --> 16:38.747
Hello?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.751
Hello? Who is this?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.799
-I'm hanging up.
-[man] I'm looking for Peter Sutherland.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.300
Do you know where he is?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.678
How… How do you know Peter?

16:52.761 --> 16:55.139
[man] Well, he's in trouble,
and I… I wanna help him.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.390
[ominous music playing]

16:56.473 --> 16:57.558
Okay, where is he?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.476
[man] Has he contacted you recently?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.062
No. Sorry, who is this?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.481
And how do you know about Peter?
And what kind of trouble--?

17:04.565 --> 17:08.110
[man] I… I shouldn't be talking to you,
but I know you care about him.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.280
-If you hear from him--
-What happened to him?

17:11.363 --> 17:15.451
[man] I'll… I'll call you in a few days,
see if he's contacted you. Goodbye.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.036
-[line disconnects]
-Wait, how do you--

17:25.836 --> 17:27.963
[tense music swelling]

17:39.933 --> 17:40.934
[Peter grunting]

17:42.436 --> 17:43.395

17:46.774 --> 17:49.568

[birds chirping]

18:00.204 --> 18:01.663
[indistinct chatter]

18:12.966 --> 18:13.926
Rose Larkin.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.636
Yes.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.555
I'm Catherine. Shall we?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.727
The President asked me to fly all the way
across the country to meet you,

18:23.811 --> 18:25.854
so here I am.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.773
Thank you. [exhales deeply]

18:28.273 --> 18:29.775
Do you know Peter Sutherland?

18:30.734 --> 18:31.860
Peter works for me.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.445
Is he okay?

18:34.863 --> 18:37.574
We don't know if he's all right
or even where he is at the moment.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.993
He went AWOL from us about a month ago.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.995
Wait, from Night Action?

18:43.038 --> 18:46.875
I'm here because you got a call
about Peter from a man you didn't know.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.669
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.921
-And he didn't identify himself?
-[Rose] No.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.215
What'd he say, precisely?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.968
Uh, that Peter was in trouble
and if I knew where he was.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.428
And when was the last time
you spoke with Peter?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.516
Like ten months ago,
when he left to start his new job.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.103
But look, Peter wouldn't just
quit on something that important,

19:06.186 --> 19:07.563
not without a good reason.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.314
What happened?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.775
-We had a setback.
-[Rose] What kind of setback?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.153
-Is he alive?
-We think so.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.487
[Rose] You think?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.739
What I'm concerned about
is his mental state.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.366
He was still adjusting to the job.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.535
So what are you doing to find him,
to help him?

19:21.618 --> 19:25.247
Everything we can. But he does have
training and experience in evasion,

19:25.914 --> 19:26.832
as you know.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.377
The man who called you,

19:31.336 --> 19:32.588
he have a foreign accent?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.632
Um, he… he sounded American.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.259
Okay.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.845
If he calls back,

19:41.305 --> 19:42.556
I'm at this number.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.850
-What is this, a Night Action line?
-No.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.645
And it goes without saying
that if Peter reaches out to you,

19:48.729 --> 19:50.355
you'll let me know immediately.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.691
-Have a lovely day.
-Okay, I still have questions.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.359
I didn't have time for this trip.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.196
I came at the request of POTUS.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.323
-So score one for you.
-Okay.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.866
But I have to get back to my work.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.327
Tell me what you're actually doing
to find him.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.163
[dramatic music playing]

20:07.456 --> 20:09.041
I'm one of the few people

20:09.124 --> 20:12.169
who knows what really happened
at Camp David last year.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.464
I know what your contributions were.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.465
And for that,

20:17.925 --> 20:21.637
you have my eternal thanks
and my sincere respect.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.514
But you are a civilian.
You're not one of us.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.642
You're not part of our family.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.394
The answers you seek
are not yours to have.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.480
And if President Travers
feels differently?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.481
She doesn't.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.525
This was a one-time favor.
If you don't believe me, call her.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.363
When we find Peter,

20:41.031 --> 20:42.491
I'll let you know he's safe.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.077
But for now,

20:46.245 --> 20:50.415
drop the words "Night Action"
from your vocabulary.

[man] Adrien's a no on the investment.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.055
Doesn't see enough differentiation
between us and the others.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.432
We'll find someone else.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.017
[Rose] I know.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.935
I'm gonna need you
on your A game from now on.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.729
What was with you the other day?

24:40.812 --> 24:44.274
-I… I… I'm sorry--
-Don't say sorry, say you'll do better.

24:44.357 --> 24:47.402
Um, I've just been worried about my mom.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.362
Oh. What's… what's wrong?

24:49.446 --> 24:51.907
She's having surgery
tomorrow morning in New York,

24:51.990 --> 24:54.451
and I need to go out there
and be with her.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.702
Surgery for what?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.829
You wanna know all the details?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.331
No.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.833
[Rose] I'll just be gone a few days.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.793
I need your full bandwidth.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.046
This is a sink-or-swim time.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.506
I'll work on the plane.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.051
Mom's gonna be asleep most of the time,
and I can handle things remotely.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.594
Won't be a problem.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.720
That a promise?

25:13.803 --> 25:15.263
-Promise.
-[dramatic music playing]

25:15.347 --> 25:18.266
[Peter] Should be leaning left.
Go to your strong side.

25:18.767 --> 25:19.601
Good shot.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.936
[indistinct chatter]

25:21.019 --> 25:23.396
-[Peter] So how you doing?
-Good. [panting]

25:23.480 --> 25:25.065
-You sure? What's up?
-[music fades]

25:26.107 --> 25:27.317
Just stuff with my dad.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.361
Okay.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.906
-You see him yet?
-[boy] No.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.535
[Peter] He's taking the shot.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.914
-You think he'll come to your game?
-[boy] I don't think so.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.293
[basket clanging]

25:45.377 --> 25:46.878
I thought he wanted to see you.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.673
Yeah, but he just doesn't really
get along with my mom.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.216
Or my stepdad.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.635
So you, uh…
you haven't talked to him at all?

25:53.718 --> 25:54.678
[boy exhaling]

25:56.304 --> 25:57.180
What?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.099
He's been talking to me on Signal.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.602
-You know what that is?
-Yeah, the, uh, messenger app, right?

26:02.686 --> 26:06.648
Yeah. My mom reads through my texts.
It's the only way he can talk to me, so…

26:06.731 --> 26:08.567
-Smart.
-Yeah.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.569
I don't think
I'm gonna get to see him, though.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.071
Hopefully, he'll come through for you.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.155
Yeah.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.407
[cell phone chiming]

26:15.490 --> 26:17.158
-[boy] Give me two seconds.
-Yeah.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.244
[siren wailing in distance]

26:22.414 --> 26:23.498
Is that him?

26:25.792 --> 26:26.918
[boy] Uh, no. It's my mom.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.963
She's about to be here.
So, I should probably go soon.

26:30.463 --> 26:31.464
Make some free throws.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.343
Every point guard should be automatic
from the line at the end of the game.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.344
I want two in a row.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.185
I see your mom. I'll get your stuff.

-[boy] Thanks.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.243
-I'll see ya.
-See ya.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.661
-[woman] Thanks.
-Have a good one.

27:01.745 --> 27:02.579
[boy] You too.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.206
Oh, my phone's dead.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.958
You can live without it for a night.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.752
It was just at 30% though.

29:10.623 --> 29:13.460
[woman] You haven't endorsed Richard Hagan
for president yet.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.087
What are you waiting for?
The election's coming up.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.506
My focus has been on other matters.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.509
Come on. Not endorsing
your party's candidate?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.344
It seems odd.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.055
You worried the Camp David scandal
could be a drag on his campaign?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.766
-No.
-Did he ask you not to endorse?

29:27.849 --> 29:30.226
If I wanted to focus
on politics rather than results,

29:30.310 --> 29:31.770
I would've run for re-election.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.147
So you're not going to endorse
Hagan or Knox?

29:34.230 --> 29:36.566
That's right. Have a nice night, Janet.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.276
[man] POTUS has arrived.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.444
[Janet sighing]

29:39.527 --> 29:41.154
Nicely evaded, Madam President.

29:41.237 --> 29:44.741
Still can't believe we nominated Hagan.
What an egotistical prick.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.826
His polls don't give him much of a chance.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.995
Right. Polls have never been wrong.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.709
Thank you all for meeting me here today
on such short notice.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.252
-My schedule's been…
-[door closing]

29:56.753 --> 29:59.214
-Well, you know how it is.
-Of course, Madam President.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.673
I only have a few minutes.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.302
Deputy Director Mosley and I would like
a rundown on all current Night Actions.

30:04.385 --> 30:05.929
[man] We just wrapped up Cuba.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.347
You've seen the report.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.891
Went smoothly.
Just cleaning up some loose ends.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.142
Nice work. Ron?

30:11.226 --> 30:14.229
The thing in Vegas got a little tricky,
but we're back on track.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.439
Cyprus is in early stages.

30:17.023 --> 30:17.941
And Peter Sutherland?

30:19.067 --> 30:20.401
Still haven't located him.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.238
Can you give us the room?

30:27.033 --> 30:28.076
[door opening]

30:30.411 --> 30:32.163
How many people
do you have looking for Peter?

30:32.247 --> 30:34.791
Plenty, but it's a big world.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.168
And he is good at disappearing.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.379
We're confident he's in the New York area.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.506
So only 14 million needles in a haystack?

30:41.589 --> 30:44.384
[Aiden] I have the bureau's resources
in New York assisting.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.136
Figured out yet
what went wrong in Bangkok?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.931
-We know more, but not enough.
-[Michelle] But if you had to guess?

30:51.266 --> 30:55.311
I registered my concerns about Peter
when you first assigned him to me.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.480
So you think Peter is the problem?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.400
The only thing I'm sure of
is he isn't around to debrief.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.195
You told me to believe in him.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.113
I did.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.534
And you told me your history with
his father wouldn't cloud your judgment.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.452
It has not. The one fact we know

31:11.536 --> 31:15.164
is that Peter's unaccounted for
doing God knows what for God knows who.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.086
-You met with Rose Larkin?
-I did.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.796
She didn't know anything useful.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.674
We don't know who called her,
asked about Peter?

31:24.757 --> 31:25.800
Not yet.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.428
What about the intel we lost in Bangkok
or the agent who sold it?

31:28.511 --> 31:30.722
We don't know where Warren Stocker is

31:30.805 --> 31:34.392
or what specific classified information
he took from the CIA.

31:34.475 --> 31:35.476
Or who he sold it to?

31:35.560 --> 31:36.978
Or who he sold it to.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.689
Other than that,
how was the flight, Miss Earhart?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.652
I do trust Peter Sutherland.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.781
I am alive because of him.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.909
That kind of thing sticks with you.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.829
I understand that,
but this work is different than that.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.414
His training was accelerated.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.458
He was pushed into the field too quickly.

31:58.541 --> 31:59.584
For which you blame me.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.546
Of course not, Madam President.
I'm not blaming, I am explaining.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.090
Yes, I don't know where he is physically,

32:06.174 --> 32:09.385
but what concerns me, what worries me,

32:10.637 --> 32:12.555
is that I don't know where he is mentally.

32:12.639 --> 32:17.018
That's something his partner Alice and I
discussed the week before she was killed.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.647
[contemplative music playing]

32:21.230 --> 32:23.900
We didn't give him enough time
after Camp David

32:23.983 --> 32:25.985
before we threw him right into training.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.950
If Peter is hiding,
he probably has a good reason.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.203
Let's find him.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.122
-Try to help him.
-Of course.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.842
Who is the biggest influence in your life?

32:50.551 --> 32:52.011
Your mother or your father?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.138
My mother.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.432
How about you?

32:57.183 --> 32:58.601
[sighing]

32:59.394 --> 33:00.228
My father.

33:00.728 --> 33:01.562
Mine too.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.151
He taught me life gets easier
when you learn to tell the difference

33:07.235 --> 33:09.946
between what you want to happen
and what you need to happen.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.616
I don't want you to find Peter.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.327
-It's already in motion.
-You should be in New York then.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.456

[Rose] Hello. [exhales]

33:42.895 --> 33:44.063
[man] Can I help you, Miss?

33:44.147 --> 33:45.356
I hope so.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.692
I'm looking for a friend.

33:51.487 --> 33:52.864
Is he staying here?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.908
We take confidentiality pretty strict.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.579
Listen, a few of his friends and I
were just worried he might be in trouble.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.831
Everyone here's been
in some kind of trouble.

34:01.914 --> 34:02.832
Right.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.711
But look, I know he was at the urgent care
down the street a couple of weeks ago.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.422
A woman at the desk
thought he might be staying here.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.882
[siren wailing in distance]

34:10.965 --> 34:13.468
I just… I just really need to find him.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.889
Lot of folks here
aren't looking to be found.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.182
[Rose scoffs]

34:19.265 --> 34:22.101
Do I look like someone
who wants to hurt him?

34:23.561 --> 34:25.897
He has a really important job
he's about to lose,

34:25.980 --> 34:28.274
and if I don't find him,

34:29.025 --> 34:31.569
his problems go
from temporary to permanent.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.904
You know what I mean?

34:33.571 --> 34:35.531
[exhaling] I… I really care about him.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.659
Will you help me?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.453
[man sighing]

34:42.371 --> 34:45.083
Okay, yeah, David was here.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.752
-So David was here?
-[man] Mm-hmm.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.880
For about a week, but he bounced.
I haven't seen him since.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.550
Okay, so he was at
the urgent care two weeks ago,

34:54.634 --> 34:56.385
and he was staying here after that?

34:56.469 --> 34:59.388
For a couple days, yeah.
But I haven't seen him since.

35:00.681 --> 35:01.516
Thank you.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.434
-[man] Mm-hmm.
-[tense music playing]

35:04.143 --> 35:06.479
Uh, sorry, this sounds crazy,

35:06.562 --> 35:10.024
but do you have any idea what he liked
to do when he was staying here?

-[Ethan] Thanks.

35:51.816 --> 35:55.319
Um, I heard you know my friend, uh, David?

35:55.903 --> 35:58.948
-I'm looking for him.
-Yeah, he, uh, coaches me.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.366
Really?

36:01.367 --> 36:04.162
Well, that sounds like him.
He's always helping people.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.290
Is he coming by today, or…

36:07.373 --> 36:10.251
I thought so,
but I've been waiting for about an hour.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.460
-And nothing, huh?
-Nope.

36:13.045 --> 36:15.631
So, uh,
when was the last time you saw him?

36:15.715 --> 36:16.674
[Ethan] Yesterday.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.050
Okay.

36:18.634 --> 36:21.220
Well, I might just,
I don't know, chill here,

36:21.304 --> 36:23.472
and see if he turns up, if that's okay?

36:23.556 --> 36:26.642
Yeah. Uh, if you do see him,
could you ask him about my phone?

36:27.226 --> 36:29.312
-What about it?
-I think he took mine by accident.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.148
And we tried Find My Phone,
but it keeps turning off,

36:32.231 --> 36:36.444
and my mom can't get a hold of him, so…

36:36.527 --> 36:39.655
Well, you are in luck
because, uh, technology is my thing,

36:39.739 --> 36:42.867
and… [inhales] …tracking phones
is my main superpower.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.285
-Really?
-[Rose chuckling] Yeah.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.579
What's your number?
Um, I bet I can find him.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.873
And… and your phone, of course.
