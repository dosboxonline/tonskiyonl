[tense music playing]

00:09.592 --> 00:10.509
Alice!

00:10.510 --> 00:12.220
- [gun firing]
- [Alice grunting]

00:15.098 --> 00:17.516
Is this what Night Action does?
Threaten civilians?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.226
We stop assholes like you.

00:19.227 --> 00:22.062
You just confirmed
Night Action's existence to him.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.023
[in Farsi] What are you doing
with the Americans?

00:24.024 --> 00:27.818
[in Farsi] I offered to give them
Iranian intelligence.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.319
Once I inform Abbas,

00:29.320 --> 00:31.155
you will be on the first flight home.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.948
[Noor] What if I could bring him to you?

00:32.949 --> 00:34.950
Peter. The American.

00:34.951 --> 00:38.871
Someone is trying to synthesize one of
the Foxglove weapons listed in that file.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.581
We need your help to determine which one.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.208
[indistinct chatter]

00:43.043 --> 00:43.918
[guard grunting]

00:47.213 --> 00:49.006
[Catherine] <i>They got
another chemical compound.</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:50.382
They have everything they need?

00:50.383 --> 00:54.053
[Solomon] <i>Do you think these people
can build a chemical weapon on their own?</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.388
They're gonna need someone
to build it for them.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.474
- No! Mom!
- [Gloria] Let her go!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.433
Dad!

00:59.434 --> 01:00.350
[Wilfred grunting]

01:00.351 --> 01:03.270
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr. Cole's postdoc fellow.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.900
[Solomon] You can stop all of this.
Just speak to my boss one-on-one.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.318
Catherine? Noor hasn't shown up yet.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.737
We have a bigger problem.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.406
[music fades]

[indistinct chatter]

01:43.686 --> 01:44.520
[music fades]

01:44.521 --> 01:47.272
Are they not feeding you enough
in that boarding school, Tomás?

01:47.273 --> 01:50.234
- Yeah, but the food's terrible.
- The boy misses the taste of home.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.070
The English can't cook.
You should send one of your chefs.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.697
Maybe they would feed him better
if they knew who his father was.

01:55.698 --> 01:56.825
What are you talking about?

01:57.700 --> 02:02.412
The money that pays for your fancy school
exists because of the Bala name.

02:02.413 --> 02:06.458
The meat on your fork, that you suck down
without a care in the world,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.502
exists because of the Bala name.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.131
And you are so ashamed of it
you cannot even speak it?

02:11.881 --> 02:13.799
After everything I sacrificed for you,

02:13.800 --> 02:19.471
you thank me by introducing yourself
as Tomás Dargin in school?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.683
Taking your mother's name?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.643
I thought it would be easier.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.440
The Bala name is your birthright.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.025
What I fought for,

02:32.026 --> 02:34.403
what our countrymen died for,

02:34.404 --> 02:38.240
what every person at this table
has dedicated their lives to.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.995
Have you forgotten your family history
at that school?

02:44.664 --> 02:48.751
My name is not good enough for you,
then my dinner should not be either.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.421
[dramatic music playing]

02:52.005 --> 02:53.381
I've heard your speeches, Father.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.301
You sent me to England 'cause you wanted
me to make something of myself.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.971
To prove that we could be smarter,
not just stronger.

03:00.805 --> 03:04.183
It won't help me to get into university
to be from a family of warmongers.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.475
[Tomás grunting]

03:05.476 --> 03:06.603
[scattered murmuring]

03:15.111 --> 03:15.987
[Viktor exhaling]

03:22.869 --> 03:25.412
Hey! Hey, Tomás.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.705
[Tomás] Not now, Markus.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.707
- [Markus] Hey.
- I said not now.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.168
Come back to the table. Apologize.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.669
I don't wanna see that bastard.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.130
You should've seen him today
when we were out on the hunt,

03:35.131 --> 03:38.051
how disappointed he was
that you weren't there.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.594
It's all he could talk about all week,

03:40.595 --> 03:43.889
taking his son hunting again
like he did when we were kids.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.807
But you couldn't bother to show up.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.226
[scoffing] He told you this?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.144
I have been on every hunt
since you were eight.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.979
I could see it on his face.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.106
[scoffing] Well,
you always wanted to be there.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.691
He never gave me the choice.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.111
He gave you a lot more than that.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.905
When my father died fighting for him,

03:59.906 --> 04:02.199
he took me in and treated me
like one of his own,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.661
but that does not stop
the rest of them in there

04:05.161 --> 04:08.664
from reminding me
that I am not really one of you.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.667
You... you cannot see how lucky you are?

04:11.251 --> 04:15.797
I would give anything to be named Bala,
and you just throw it away.

04:16.756 --> 04:20.384
When Uncle Viktor heard that you were
going by Tomás Dargin in school,

04:20.385 --> 04:21.970
he was devastated.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.389
It was you.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.224
You told him.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.768
Somebody needed to remind you
of your place.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.812
[Markus grunting]

04:35.191 --> 04:36.776
Don't forget your place either.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.069
Bala isn't your name.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.405
It never will be.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.993
I'm better than this family.
My father hates me for it. You both do.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.537
Go, be his lapdog.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.955
Lick up his leftovers.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.042
It's not that slap that stops
the other kids from bullying you.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.460
No.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.045
It's your name.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.965
[tense music playing]

05:12.812 --> 05:14.814
[suspenseful music playing]

05:17.775 --> 05:18.943
[Tomás] Bring them in.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.370
Line them up.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.497
Lock the family
in one of the fridge units.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.833
Prepare the chemist
and his assistant for the lab.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.918
- [Jesse] Dad?
- [Wilfred] It's going to be okay.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.712
- Just do what they say.
- Dad?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.547
Do what they say. You'll be fine.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.091
- Don't do it!
- [Gloria] I got her, Wil. I've got her.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.178
[Gloria and Jesse grunting]

[gears shifting]

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
[keys jangling]

06:09.535 --> 06:11.912
Okay. We're out of the city.
Where are we going?

06:11.913 --> 06:13.997
[Solomon laughing]

06:13.998 --> 06:16.249
[Solomon grunting, exhaling]

06:16.250 --> 06:17.710
[Peter] Where are we going?

06:18.378 --> 06:21.671
Physical violence is not an effective
interrogation technique.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.299
I know, but it felt good,
and you're pissing me off.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.344
You still don't know
how this works, do you?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.346
- What do you want?
- Put a phone in my hands.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.850
I'll call it in, I'll set up the meeting,
and I'll take you to him.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.726
It's that simple.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.229
[crickets chirping]

06:37.021 --> 06:42.025
You make one move, one move, that
I don't like and we're back to square one.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.194
Do you understand me?

06:43.694 --> 06:44.779
The clock is ticking.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.365
[handcuffs clanking]

06:48.366 --> 06:49.534
Alice Leeds.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.245
That was her name, right?

06:52.745 --> 06:53.830
Your dead partner?

06:56.082 --> 06:59.168
Do you even know the name of the man
whose life you took in Thailand?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.422
Yeah, I didn't think so.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.465
Call your boss.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.271
Yeah, I got Sutherland with me.
I'm bringing him in.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.941
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

07:29.532 --> 07:30.533
[car door opening]

07:35.079 --> 07:37.456
- What's the update?
- [Catherine] His phone is still off.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.375
He ditched the Tahoe next to a warehouse
on the outskirts of the city,

07:40.376 --> 07:43.671
and a different set of vehicle tracks
left in the opposite direction.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.798
We picked up a gray van
on a nearby traffic cam

07:46.799 --> 07:48.800
that could match the time and direction,

07:48.801 --> 07:51.261
but it was the wrong angle
to catch a plate.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.179
Christ.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.098
We've got a chemical weapon
in the hands of unknown assailants,

07:55.099 --> 07:56.933
a dead French intelligence officer,

07:56.934 --> 07:59.519
agents chasing ghosts
around every corner of the city,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.147
multiple civilians abducted.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.107
Now you're telling me
your only solid lead for any of it

08:04.108 --> 08:06.152
managed to disappear with your agent?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.988
Let me ask a different way.
Is Sutherland a suspect now?

08:09.989 --> 08:12.658
- Not until I know more.
- Then get out there and find him.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.912
Foxglove is no longer
Night Action's responsibility,

08:16.913 --> 08:17.954
Sutherland is.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.123
Understood.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.592
[music fades]

08:30.301 --> 08:32.802
Shouldn't we be in hazmat suits
or something for this?

08:32.803 --> 08:34.597
This whole lab is a hazmat suit.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.599
Designed to provide
its own source of clean air

08:37.600 --> 08:42.188
and keep every chemical component
in glass-lined, inert, sealed vessels,

08:42.688 --> 08:46.734
all encased behind a thick layer
of corrosion-resistant nickel alloy.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.863
Given the nature of what the CIA
was using this lab to research,

08:51.364 --> 08:54.032
they wanted to make sure
nothing inside could ever get out.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.076
[knocking on glass]

08:56.327 --> 08:57.827
What about when we're inside?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.996
Don't touch anything unless I tell you to,

08:59.997 --> 09:02.707
otherwise a hazmat suit
will be the least of your worries.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.876
[suspenseful music playing]

09:04.877 --> 09:06.837
- [air hissing]
- [door opening]

09:13.886 --> 09:17.681
Take a moment, survey the lab,
make sure you have everything you need.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.269
You really are trying to make K.X.
This is never gonna work.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.771
Not according to your research.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.188
[papers clattering]

09:25.189 --> 09:27.274
That? That was all theory.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.194
Nothing of this magnitude
was ever produced during the study.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.445
What you're asking is--

09:32.446 --> 09:34.574
To save your family's lives.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.492
If you do not do as you're told,

09:37.493 --> 09:41.079
I will drag them in front of you
and put bullets through their eyes.

09:41.080 --> 09:41.997
Tick, tick, tick.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.709
But it takes... it takes more than just me.

09:45.209 --> 09:48.378
I need... I need time,
I need, uh, research staff. I--

09:48.379 --> 09:49.629
So this one is useless?

09:49.630 --> 09:50.798
- Wait!
- [Wilfred] Wait! No!

09:51.382 --> 09:52.300
You don't understand.

09:53.217 --> 09:58.013
If any part of this process goes wrong,
if... if I make a mistake, it could mean--

09:58.014 --> 09:59.432
Then don't fuck it up.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.642
Get to work.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.688
- [air hissing]
- [door opening]

10:10.067 --> 10:11.444
[softly] What do we do?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.529
These materials in these quantities...

10:14.530 --> 10:17.408
What they're asking
might not even be possible.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.995
Well, they're gonna know
if we're doing nothing.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.705
We have to look like we're working.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.707
If I get this even slightly wrong--

10:25.708 --> 10:29.377
What do you need to do to make it safe?
To make sure you're doing it right?

10:29.378 --> 10:31.254
- Maybe a pilot batch.
- A what?

10:31.255 --> 10:33.340
A small test
to work out process parameters

10:33.341 --> 10:34.884
to replicate on a larger scale.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.636
All right, then.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.972
As slowly as we possibly can,
let's get to work.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.184
- And then what?
- Then we find a way out of here.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.395
[music fades]

10:48.189 --> 10:49.023
[gears shifting]

10:50.399 --> 10:51.901
[car horn honking in distance]

10:56.947 --> 10:57.782
[Peter] Come on.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.411
[blade clicking]

11:04.705 --> 11:05.623
[cuffs snapping]

11:10.419 --> 11:11.837
You're not getting near him armed.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.676
You're the one in a hurry.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.599
All right, let's go.

11:25.851 --> 11:26.811
It was Caleb,

11:28.187 --> 11:29.897
the man you killed in Bangkok.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.400
His two older brothers, both parents,

11:33.401 --> 11:36.945
a grandmother,
uncles, cousins, their families,

11:36.946 --> 11:39.824
nieces, nephews, friends, myself included...

11:41.367 --> 11:43.076
we were all at his funeral.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.830
Forty-two people who loved him.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.459
But we'll never get to see him again
because you were doing your job.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.170
I guess that's the life, right, Peter?

11:55.131 --> 11:56.172
Have a good talk.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.092
[suspenseful music playing]

12:02.096 --> 12:03.472
[Peter] I'm here. What do you want?

12:03.973 --> 12:04.807
Nothing.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.768
You're the one seeking something, right?

12:08.894 --> 12:09.979
Let's take a walk.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.858
If there's one thing that I've learned
in this line of work,

12:14.859 --> 12:18.863
it is that everyone
and everything has a price.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.657
So, whatever it is you want from me,

12:22.366 --> 12:24.701
you'll need to determine
how much you're willing to pay.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.745
[Peter scoffing]

12:26.245 --> 12:29.999
So after all this, that's all you are,
is a glorified middleman?

12:30.499 --> 12:32.960
Buying and selling intel
for, what, a percentage?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.838
You sold a fucking chemical weapon
to the highest bidder.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.883
Perceptive, but incorrect.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.136
I sold it to the bidder
with the most conviction,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.053
most likely to succeed.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.013
Succeed at what?

12:45.014 --> 12:49.100
Well, you'll have to ask them,
assuming you find it in time.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.602
So you gonna tell me where they are?

12:50.603 --> 12:54.815
I suppose that depends
on how much it's worth to you.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.484
Catching on yet?

12:57.485 --> 13:01.946
All those lives that are gonna be lost
when they use Foxglove,

13:01.947 --> 13:03.406
they're just meaningless to you?

13:03.407 --> 13:05.200
If I had to put a value on them,

13:05.201 --> 13:10.456
I'd say less to me than what
Rose Larkin's life means to you.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.375
Now, here we are. You see?

13:14.084 --> 13:14.919
What do you want?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.797
The secretary general
of the United Nations

13:18.798 --> 13:20.674
has something that I seek.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.551
A case file.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.305
IUN0134...

13:27.306 --> 13:32.018
...dash 20180713.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.937
The numbers after the dash

13:33.938 --> 13:37.066
represents a date
that might help you find it.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.193
I'm gonna say the file number
one more time.

13:40.194 --> 13:44.281
Listen carefully
and memorize it for Rose, okay?

13:44.949 --> 13:48.827
IUN0134...

13:48.828 --> 13:54.458
...dash 20180713.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.544
- Got it?
- Yeah.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.632
His computer is one of the few
that would have access to it,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.050
if not the only one.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.927
You bring me that file,

14:05.928 --> 14:09.556
and I'll give you the location of where
the Foxglove weapon is being assembled,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.475
and where Ms. Larkin
is currently being held captive.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.478
So that's it? A file?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.438
Well, you said it yourself.

14:17.064 --> 14:20.608
I'm in the business of buying
and selling intelligence, am I not?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.193
You'd sell out a client for this?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.821
I mean, how is this file
more valuable than Foxglove?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.781
[man] Let me tell you something
about value.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.242
I didn't know my grandfather very well.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.869
He died when I was a kid.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.329
I could see how much my mother loved him,

14:33.330 --> 14:35.374
the impact he had on my mother's life.

14:35.958 --> 14:40.378
When he passed, I came into possession
of one of his old bottles of aftershave.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.047
No monetary value,

14:42.631 --> 14:44.592
but to me, it was priceless.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.971
It's hard to explain, really,
but he had touched it.

14:49.972 --> 14:50.973
It was him.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.226
Or rather, what he represented,

14:55.269 --> 14:56.978
my mother's happiness.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.814
That's how value works.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.191
What's valuable to me
is not up to you to decide.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.320
Similarly, one woman's life
that means the world to you

15:05.321 --> 15:07.323
means absolutely nothing to me.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.658
Now, here you stand,

15:10.659 --> 15:13.829
ready to throw
your entire life away for hers.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.957
I understand that too, Peter,

15:18.083 --> 15:19.293
so I'm telling you,

15:20.753 --> 15:21.629
I'll take it.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.298
This isn't about some file.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.676
If I do this for you--

15:28.677 --> 15:30.220
I'll own you.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.140
And that, my new friend, is the price.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.851
Your life for hers.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.022
[Peter] How would I even get in there?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.024
Conviction.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.319
Repeat the file number back to me.

15:46.904 --> 15:52.868
IUN0134 dash...

15:53.911 --> 15:55.287
...uh, 2018...

15:56.705 --> 15:58.248
...0713.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.377
You see? Most likely to succeed.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.046
I know what you're thinking.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.757
The elephant in the room.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.886
But I assure you, the past decisions
of Peter Sutherland, Sr.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.306
do not determine
what is important to you in this moment.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.518
What's valuable in this moment.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.770
The decision is yours.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.023
The repercussions are yours to bear.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.527
When it's done, how do I contact you?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.906
When you have what I require,
call this number.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.449
Let it ring.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.744
You'll receive a text with instructions.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.329
Good luck.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.380
Watch him.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.550
Make sure he doesn't deviate
from his path.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.266
[Peter exhaling]

17:07.067 --> 17:09.361
[phone line ringing]

17:10.195 --> 17:11.029
[Noor] <i>Peter?</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:13.490
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you.

17:14.074 --> 17:18.077
<i>Look, I know I'm the last person
that you wanna hear from right now,</i>

17:18.078 --> 17:21.039
<i>the absolute last person
you'd ever do a favor for, but--</i>

17:21.040 --> 17:22.082
What do you want?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.417
I need to get into the UN building.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.128
<i>- There anything you can tell me about it?</i>
- The UN?

17:27.129 --> 17:30.215
Yeah, I need to get in
without setting off any, uh...

17:31.800 --> 17:32.925
You know what? I--

17:32.926 --> 17:36.471
<i>I'm sorry. I... I shouldn't have called you.
This is impossible.</i>

17:36.472 --> 17:37.431
Wait.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.434
I can get you inside,

17:41.435 --> 17:44.270
<i>but we need to meet in person. Now.</i>

17:44.271 --> 17:47.190
I thought you were out of town with Sami.
What happened to the pickup?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.275
I didn't go.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.653
How could I
after all the lies you told me?

17:52.237 --> 17:53.072
Je--

17:54.323 --> 17:55.324
I'm sorry, Noor.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.158
[Noor] <i>I can help you.</i>

17:57.159 --> 18:00.328
But the only reason why I'm talking to you

18:00.329 --> 18:02.705
is because I need something from you now.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.624
[Peter] <i>Yeah.</i>

18:04.208 --> 18:06.042
And I can only ask you in person.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.544
Fine. Um...

18:08.337 --> 18:10.339
Meet me at the same basement as before.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.215
Okay? I'm on my way now.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.925
[suspenseful music playing]

18:13.926 --> 18:16.053
- [cell phone clattering]
- [engine starting]

18:29.191 --> 18:32.819
Okay. Uh, would you open the valve
on the nitrogen tank?

18:32.820 --> 18:34.404
[music fades]

18:37.866 --> 18:38.825
[air hissing]

18:38.826 --> 18:40.284
Okay. Now what?

18:40.285 --> 18:43.538
We wait a few moments.
That should pressurize the pumps

18:43.539 --> 18:46.499
and purge any remaining oxygen
from the transport lines.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
In the meantime,

18:47.501 --> 18:50.211
we need to start working on a stabilizer
to inhibit oxidation.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.840
I'm thinking a phosphate ester
from phosphorus trichloride.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.175
I'm sorry, high school chemistry
didn't cover this.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.344
It's okay. This compound, K.X.,

18:58.345 --> 19:02.140
when exposed to air will rapidly oxidize
and expand as it vaporizes.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.435
It's what makes exposure
to even a few milliliters so lethal.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.021
So the stabilizer
prevents that from happening.

19:09.022 --> 19:12.984
Prevent? No. But it will slow oxidation
as we work with it in the lab.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.070
K.X. is just too unstable without it.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.282
Uh, this mitigates the reaction
like a fail-safe.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.076
At least, I hope. Understand?

19:21.743 --> 19:22.619
Yeah.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.079
No.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.333
It's the best chance we have of scaling
this up without killing ourselves.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.545
[inaudible]

19:32.546 --> 19:35.256
[Tomás] If he says he needs more help,
we ought to give it to him.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.674
He's got his assistant. He's fine.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.217
The woman you almost killed?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.845
Your recklessness is gonna cost us dearly.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.847
If the chemist isn't able to do his work--

19:42.848 --> 19:46.518
I will bring his wife and daughter to him
one body part at a time until he does.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.021
Everyone appreciates a deadline.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.941
That's always been your problem.
No balls to do the dirty work.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.902
Happy to let me get my fingernails dirty.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.321
And you can't see the forest
for the trees.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.906
We have one shot at getting this right.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.659
That family is the only leverage we have
at getting the chemist to comply.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.870
- Get your head out of your ass.
- Or what?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.413
[suspenseful music playing]

20:07.414 --> 20:09.499
[Markus laughing]

20:11.877 --> 20:14.004
I'm glad to see
you finally found your spine,

20:14.838 --> 20:17.049
but don't forget
who made all of this possible.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.551
[Markus exhaling]

20:20.552 --> 20:21.969
You want to help?

20:21.970 --> 20:25.265
Find some leverage on the girl
that you're so desperate to keep alive.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.684
We have a leash around the doctor's neck.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.187
Now we need to get one around hers.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.817
[door opening]

20:36.944 --> 20:37.861
[door closing]

20:42.574 --> 20:43.867
[music fades]

20:45.994 --> 20:47.162
[footsteps approaching]

20:51.708 --> 20:53.794
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. It's just me.

20:54.836 --> 20:58.047
There's nothing I can say to make up
for what happened to your brother.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.758
And you did not deserve
to be lied to like that,

21:00.759 --> 21:02.886
and I'm sorry about all of it.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.931
I have no right to ask you for anything.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.393
I'm not even gonna ask you
for your forgiveness.

21:09.893 --> 21:10.769
But please,

21:11.979 --> 21:13.605
I need your help to save Rose.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.775
This has all been about trying to stop
a chemical-weapons attack.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.152
And whoever's trying to do it
just took Rose.

21:20.153 --> 21:23.073
And if I can't stop this,
they're gonna kill her,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.534
along with thousands of other people.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.537
But if I can stop it, and I have to try,

21:29.538 --> 21:31.373
this'll all have been worth something.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.126
I need to get into the UN.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.672
And if you help me,
I can take you to your mother tonight.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.382
I swear.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.218
I can't believe after all of this
you would lie to me again.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.055
- I'm not lying.
- I know that you left my mother in Iran.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.891
I know they have her in custody
doing who knows what to her.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.435
I know our lives mean nothing to you!

21:52.436 --> 21:53.979
- Noor, she's here.
- Liar!

22:01.987 --> 22:03.697
[cell phone vibrating]

22:09.828 --> 22:10.661
Yeah?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.830
- It's Peter.
- [Sami] <i>Surprised to hear from you.</i>

22:12.831 --> 22:16.042
Listen, I'm here with Noor.
She didn't make the pickup because of me.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.127
<i>The Iranians told her
her mother never made it out.</i>

22:18.128 --> 22:19.880
I need you to put Azita on the phone.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.423
And then we'll talk.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.304
Here.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.557
[in Farsi] Mom?

22:31.558 --> 22:33.101
[in Farsi] Keep them talking.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.645
[dramatic music playing]

22:37.147 --> 22:38.939
- [Noor] <i>Mom?</i>
- Noor?

22:38.940 --> 22:40.816
[Noor gasping]

22:40.817 --> 22:42.401
[Azita in Farsi] <i>Noor? Is that you?</i>

22:42.402 --> 22:45.071
[Noor sobbing]

22:45.072 --> 22:47.199
[Noor] Yes... Yes, it's me.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.283
Are you okay? Where are you?

22:49.284 --> 22:50.368
New York.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.994
[Noor's breath shuddering]

22:51.995 --> 22:53.830
[Azita] <i>I made it out.</i>

22:54.790 --> 22:55.874
<i>But...</i>

22:57.834 --> 22:58.752
Farhad...

23:01.588 --> 23:02.589
[Noor] I know.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.758
They gave me the news.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.722
I'm so sorry.

23:11.932 --> 23:12.974
It's my fault.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.310
It's my fault this all happened.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.813
[Azita] <i>No, don't say that.</i>

23:18.772 --> 23:19.689
Where are you?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.651
- When can I see you?
- [Noor] <i>Soon.</i>

23:23.318 --> 23:24.527
I'll see you very soon.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.487
[Noor sniffling]

23:26.488 --> 23:27.780
I love you, Mom.

23:27.781 --> 23:31.118
[sniffling] Me too, <i>azizam</i>.
I love you very much.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.124
[Azita sniffling]

23:38.125 --> 23:39.251
[in English] Peter?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
[Sami sighing]

23:47.217 --> 23:49.760
Keep it. When we're clear,
just hit redial. Okay?

23:49.761 --> 23:50.928
Sami will come pick you up.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.266
If he doesn't find you first.
He's probably already tracking it.

23:55.016 --> 23:55.933
[Noor exhaling]

23:55.934 --> 23:58.019
Noor, can you help me?

23:59.729 --> 24:00.689
Please?

24:03.066 --> 24:07.069
With your picture, I could make you
a guest badge back at the mission.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.155
That will probably get you
into the building, but--

24:09.156 --> 24:10.322
That's all I need.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.575
But it doesn't matter.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.034
Javad is here.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.995
He's waiting outside to capture you.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.872
They found out what I was doing
at the mission,

24:17.873 --> 24:20.166
and they detained me
to send me back to Iran.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.085
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.003
The moment we leave here,

24:24.004 --> 24:26.715
Javad and the other guards
will take you back to the mission.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.592
- How many of 'em are there?
- Four.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.010
- Are they armed?
- Probably.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.513
They're expecting you
to put up a fight like last time.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.767
- What'll happen to you?
- They'll escort me back to the mission.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.230
What are you thinking?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.365
You know how to use one of these?

24:53.366 --> 24:55.202
[suspenseful music playing]

24:57.037 --> 24:58.580
[air hissing]

25:00.248 --> 25:01.457
[music fades]

25:01.458 --> 25:04.001
If the stabilizer works
with the ratio I've calculated,

25:04.002 --> 25:06.546
the fully mixed K.X.
should take on a purple hue.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.172
How do you know?

25:08.173 --> 25:09.507
Red phosphorus in the stabilizer

25:09.508 --> 25:12.009
and the hydrogen cyanide remnants
left over in the cyanogen,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.845
once condensed into a liquid form,
should turn purple.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.431
That is if the bonding was successful.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.850
[banging on glass]

25:21.353 --> 25:23.604
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.690
[tense music playing]

25:35.242 --> 25:36.117
In here.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.337
Who are you?

25:48.171 --> 25:49.046
Tell me the truth.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.965
I'm Dr. Cole's research assistant.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.634
- You're no chemist.
- I'm just nervous.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.220
I've never had a gun to my head
doing this kind of thing before.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.138
You're lying.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.683
This was in your bag.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.893
Classified CIA files on Foxglove.

26:02.894 --> 26:07.606
I... I must have picked it up
at Dr. Cole's house or something.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.275
We were going through all of his files.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.944
You're not as good at deception
as you fancy yourself.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.155
So, one last time. Who are you?

26:15.156 --> 26:17.659
Who do you work for?
Who else knows you're here?

26:19.119 --> 26:19.995
Everybody.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.206
Within the hour,
this place will be swarming with cops.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.417
Wait, wait, wait! Please!

26:26.293 --> 26:28.127
My family spent years

26:28.128 --> 26:30.754
trying to get your government
to admit this even existed.

26:30.755 --> 26:34.174
And now you show up carrying this file
in a bag like it's nothing.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.676
Start talking now.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.387
Okay, okay. You're right.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.181
How do you think I got it?

26:41.308 --> 26:43.851
I'm part of the team
that's been tracking you.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.562
And the rest of them
are on their way here.

26:46.438 --> 26:50.190
If you kill me, you'll just be adding
murder of an FBI agent to your rap sheet.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.276
I don't believe you.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.029
If anyone knew where you were,
they'd be here.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.740
How did you get this file?
What aren't you telling me?

26:57.907 --> 26:59.701
You're looking
for a way out of all of this.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.622
I saw you at Dr. Cole's house.
You don't wanna hurt anybody.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.999
The others,
they're forcing you to do this?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.834
They work for me.
They do what I tell them.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.210
[Rose] Are you sure about that?

27:10.211 --> 27:13.631
I saw you arguing with that other guy.
Didn't look like he was taking orders.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.050
Yeah, well, I saw you
bumbling around in that lab

27:16.051 --> 27:17.801
like you'd never set foot in one.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.845
How long do you think
you can keep up that charade?

27:19.846 --> 27:21.263
Then help me stop it.

27:21.264 --> 27:24.975
It can't be stopped. The West is gonna pay
for what they did to my family.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.353
So this is part
of some stupid revenge plot?

27:27.354 --> 27:30.105
You're really planning
on using this thing on people?

27:30.106 --> 27:31.690
Listen, I know about Foxglove.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.150
I know how dangerous it is,

27:33.151 --> 27:35.402
and I know you didn't
wanna kill me back there.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.571
So I'm willing to bet
you don't wanna kill thousands

27:37.572 --> 27:39.616
because that's what will happen.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.243
- You don't have to do this.
- Shut up.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.205
- You could be the hero here.
- I said that's enough!

27:46.206 --> 27:47.581
[Tomás's breath shuddering]

27:47.582 --> 27:49.626
It's... it's too late to stop what's coming.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.252
Not if you let me go.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.424
You wanna know how I got that file?
I am working with the FBI.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.009
And those chemicals you stole today,

27:59.010 --> 28:01.471
we were right behind you
every step of the way.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.307
You're right, no one's coming.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.767
But you can help us.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.979
Let me go,
and I'll bring the FBI, CIA, everybody.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.564
We can shut it down here and now.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.649
If Markus catches us--

28:13.650 --> 28:15.110
We have to take that risk.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.156
I can tell you're not a monster.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.118
There are people out there
who care about you, who... who love you,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.787
who want a future with you, right?

28:26.454 --> 28:28.289
What would they think about all of this?

28:29.290 --> 28:30.166
Sloane.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.462
S-- Sloane always says
I'm better than my family.

28:35.088 --> 28:38.424
Talk to Dr. Cole,
ask him what this chemical is capable of.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.801
And then ask yourself,

28:41.010 --> 28:43.763
can you really live
with all that blood on your hands?

28:45.140 --> 28:46.015
Can Sloane?

28:47.976 --> 28:50.145
What kind of person
do you wanna be for her?

28:53.606 --> 28:54.441
Wait here.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.363

[indistinct chatter]

29:13.501 --> 29:14.377
Hold on.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.672
Stop right there.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.591
Noor, what's going on?

29:21.259 --> 29:22.594
[in Farsi] He's all yours.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.178
I want to go home now.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.722
[in Farsi] Take her to the mission.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.808
[suspenseful music playing]

29:30.310 --> 29:31.144
[Peter] Noor.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.562
Noor!

29:35.648 --> 29:37.399
[in English] I'm taking you into custody

29:37.400 --> 29:40.194
for the crime of espionage
against the Islamic Republic.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.612
Just gonna arrest me in New York?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.073
It's a very dangerous city.
People disappear all the time.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.075
What if I don't comply?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.286
This could go another way.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.660
[Tomás] You and I need to talk.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.455
- Is that it?
- It's our control sample.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.123
[music fades]

34:03.124 --> 34:05.668
A stable K.X. chemical agent.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.087
I want your honest opinion.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.507
If this weapon were to be used,

34:12.091 --> 34:13.091
could it be contained?

34:13.092 --> 34:14.886
- Contained?
- [Tomás] That's what I said.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.345
You-- You don't understand.

34:17.346 --> 34:20.974
You don't create something like this
if you're concerned about containment.

34:20.975 --> 34:24.687
This compound you asked me to build,
do you even know how it works?

34:26.814 --> 34:27.774
[Wilfred exhaling]

34:30.693 --> 34:34.446
In application, it's like any other
binary chemical munition.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.949
But in the case of K.X.,
the secondary element is oxygen.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.536
When exposed to air,

34:41.162 --> 34:43.914
we're talking about
an exponential increase in molarity.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.541
Drop that in a room full of people,
it'll expand so rapidly,

34:46.542 --> 34:48.960
they'll be breathing it in
before they knew it hit the floor.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.505
- You're saying they'll suffocate.
- The lucky ones.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.672
[sinister music playing]

34:52.673 --> 34:56.051
What's more likely to happen
is they'll feel the blistering effects

34:56.052 --> 34:58.762
as the air inside them reacts to exposure

34:58.763 --> 35:00.847
and it expands in their lungs.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.059
It burns you from the inside
as you breathe it in,

35:04.060 --> 35:08.271
and from the outside as the vapor
comes in contact with your skin.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.731
The more you inhale,

35:09.732 --> 35:14.361
the more oxygen you suck in
as you struggle to breathe from the pain,

35:14.362 --> 35:17.614
the more it burns, the faster it expands.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.242
You'd pray to suffocate.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.120
No...

35:24.997 --> 35:27.166
it cannot be contained.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.254
That vial in your hand, that's murder.

35:31.921 --> 35:32.755
This?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.299
This is massacre.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.809
I want you to listen very carefully.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.688
Under no circumstances
can you complete your work here, doctor.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.357
Then you shouldn't
have threatened my family

35:52.358 --> 35:54.609
and put me in a transparent cage.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.527
They're watching.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.946
Then stall
for as long as humanly possible.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.825
Stall long enough,
and I'll get you and the girl out of here.

36:01.784 --> 36:04.077

[in Farsi] Please, I--

37:53.354 --> 37:55.314
[Abbas] I asked you,
what are you doing here?

37:56.190 --> 37:57.191
Explain yourself.

37:58.818 --> 37:59.902
It's true...

38:01.404 --> 38:03.406
You're spying for the Americans.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.700
What have you told them?

No, nothing, I...

38:16.168 --> 38:18.878
- That's none of your business.
- Your daughter's on that list.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.964
If you say one word about this,

38:20.965 --> 38:23.217
I'll only make things worse for you.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.136
You're trying to protect her.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.972
Traitors like you deserve
every punishment they will receive.

38:28.973 --> 38:32.434
They deserve to be round up
and brought home to face their crimes.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.978
But your daughter committed no crime.

38:34.979 --> 38:35.896
Did she?

38:36.772 --> 38:37.982
I heard what happened.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.277
Running away to Paris with a boyfriend.

38:43.779 --> 38:44.989
Is this her address?

38:46.490 --> 38:47.992
So they know where she is...

38:48.743 --> 38:51.244
and you have to turn this over
to your superiors.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.331
[dramatic music playing]

38:56.125 --> 38:57.960
What if I can help you?

38:59.670 --> 39:05.092
The only thing you're going to do for me
is turn yourself in.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.347
Let me leave.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.017
I'll go straight to the UN,

39:13.517 --> 39:16.062
straight to the French delegation,
and hand it right to them.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.231
We can warn these people.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.692
Warn your daughter.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.613
Give her a chance to live her life.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.869
How could I trust a traitor
to do anything noble?

39:33.079 --> 39:35.081
You can still blame the whole thing on me.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.167
You already have
all the evidence you need.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.380
You know I was trying to defect...

39:43.381 --> 39:45.883
and get my family out.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.970
And you know my brother
was killed because of it.

39:52.431 --> 39:56.976
There is nothing you and your jails
can do to me that will ever

39:56.977 --> 39:59.563
make me feel worse than I already do.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.901
Now when my mother looks at me,

40:05.528 --> 40:10.658
all she will ever see
is how I lost her only son.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.538
You can't do worse to me than that.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.458
All you have to do
is let me keep being the traitor.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.585
Tell Javad everything.

40:22.545 --> 40:28.801
I broke in here, I took the papers,
and I ran off before you could stop me.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.138
That's all anyone has to know.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.852
Give your daughter that chance.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.452
I'll give you a ten-minute head start.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.123
Then I'm alerting the guards.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.009
[suspenseful music playing]

41:26.150 --> 41:28.443
[in English] I've got Noor
outside of the Iranian mission.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.029
It's where the cell signal took me.
There's no sign of Peter.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.655
<i>You want me to take her to her mother?</i>

41:32.656 --> 41:34.533
Not yet, but stay on her.

41:35.284 --> 41:38.119
We have to see if she leads us
to Peter before we pull her out.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.914
<i>- I'll see what else I can think of.</i>
- Got it.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.416
[suspenseful music swelling]

41:43.417 --> 41:44.627
[music fades]

41:59.225 --> 42:00.392
[light switch clicking]

42:01.852 --> 42:02.937
[Peter wincing]

42:05.272 --> 42:06.315
[glass clattering]

42:09.735 --> 42:10.653
[glass clattering]

42:11.654 --> 42:13.656
[Peter breathing deeply, exhaling]

42:19.537 --> 42:20.496
[Catherine] Where is he?

42:22.831 --> 42:23.873
Slowly.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.751
[tense music playing]

42:26.252 --> 42:28.253
I shouldn't have told you
where this place was.

42:28.254 --> 42:31.297
Where's Solomon?
What happened at the safe house?

42:31.298 --> 42:32.507
I need you to trust me.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.260
Trust? You--

42:35.886 --> 42:37.053
Did you just let him go?

42:37.054 --> 42:39.765
Solomon led me to his boss, the buyer.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.767
He said he's gonna tell me
who he sold Foxglove to,

42:42.768 --> 42:44.811
and when he does, you'll be my first call.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.064
But you have to let me
out of that door now.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.233
- Peter...
- Whoever has Foxglove has Rose.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.944
I know. We're doing
everything we can to find her.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.071
You're nowhere, right?

42:54.697 --> 42:58.533
You have no leads, you have no evidence,
you have no chance, you have nothing.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.867
Then help us the right way.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.953
There is no right way, Catherine.
There's this way.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.582
You stay on this path, and you are done.

43:05.082 --> 43:08.251
There is no ends
justifying the means this time.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.837
Catherine, you have to--

43:12.798 --> 43:15.216
- I'm not gonna do nothing.
- Neither am I.

43:15.217 --> 43:18.428
But because of your actions,
I have to take you in now,

43:18.429 --> 43:20.179
and I do not wanna use force.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.222
I do not.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.393
If I have to spend
the rest of my life in a cell

43:25.102 --> 43:27.396
'cause I chose to save thousands of lives,

43:28.647 --> 43:29.480
so be it.

43:29.481 --> 43:33.193
Is this about thousands of lives,
or is this about Rose?

43:35.904 --> 43:38.240
Shoot me, or get out of my way.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.909
[suspenseful music swelling]

43:42.369 --> 43:43.829
No! Peter!

43:45.456 --> 43:47.290
[banging on door]

43:47.291 --> 43:48.709
[Catherine] Peter!

[tense music playing]

44:12.358 --> 44:13.232
What's going on?

44:13.233 --> 44:16.569
He's been at work for hours,
and has nothing to show for it but this.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.112
It's unacceptable.

44:18.113 --> 44:20.657
Please be careful.
That could kill all of us.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.951
- What are you doing with that?
- What's taking you so long?

44:23.535 --> 44:26.621
I had to test it at bench scale first.
That takes time.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.456
- Time we do not have.
- Listen to him.

44:28.457 --> 44:31.710
- That's why we brought him here.
- Maybe you don't understand the situation.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.670
Maybe you need a reminder.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.963
- Bring the family!
- No! No, wait!

44:35.964 --> 44:37.173
- No!
- Markus!

44:37.174 --> 44:39.885
We are done doing it your way.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.766
[Gloria shuddering]

44:46.809 --> 44:47.768
I got you.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.854
[Gloria and Jesse grunting]

44:52.648 --> 44:54.023
[Gloria] No! No!

44:54.024 --> 44:56.275
Please, please.
I've done everything you asked.

44:56.276 --> 44:58.069
No! No, please don't do this.

44:58.070 --> 44:59.237
- Don't.
- [Wilfred] Wait.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.280
- [Jesse] Mom.
- You're going to tell me the truth?

45:01.281 --> 45:02.448
I am telling you the truth.

45:02.449 --> 45:05.535
We can make the larger batch now.
The test proves the theory.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.787
- Why are you taking so long?
- I am not!

45:07.788 --> 45:10.373
I'm not! I-- I'm not!

45:10.374 --> 45:11.709
I'm not taking long!

45:12.918 --> 45:14.128
Why do you keep looking at him?

45:18.298 --> 45:20.091
- What did you tell him?
- Go.

45:20.092 --> 45:22.803
- Markus, you're--
- Why did you take her out of the lab?

45:23.846 --> 45:25.180
You're taking this too far.

45:25.889 --> 45:28.725
I say what this family does
or doesn't do, not you.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.310
I'm putting an end to this.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.485
Lock him in the fridge.

45:39.486 --> 45:42.321
What? Are you crazy? You work for me!

45:42.322 --> 45:44.949
- Lock them in the office.
- Markus, stop this!

45:44.950 --> 45:46.200
- It'll be fine.
- No!

45:46.201 --> 45:48.035
I am Tomás Bala!

45:48.036 --> 45:50.289
- It'll be okay. Just do what they say.
- No!

45:53.292 --> 45:56.002
[Markus] You and you, get back in that lab

45:56.003 --> 45:58.422
and don't come out until the work is done.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.133
This is the last time I ask nicely.

46:22.112 --> 46:22.945
What took so long?

46:22.946 --> 46:24.322
- Did you get the badge?
- Yes.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.616
But change of plans.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.700
- What?
- I'm coming with you.

46:27.701 --> 46:29.787
[suspenseful music playing]

46:32.247 --> 46:33.415
[footsteps approaching]

46:36.543 --> 46:37.835
[music fades]

46:37.836 --> 46:39.004
Leave us.

46:50.599 --> 46:53.018
Our cause has no room for non-believers.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.521
When did you lose your faith, Tomás?

46:56.522 --> 46:58.439
Markus, cousin---

46:58.440 --> 47:02.401
No. You don't get to call us
family anymore. That time is over.

47:02.402 --> 47:05.823
You and I set out to expose
the lies of the West.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.199
Of America.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.619
Not to make the same
stupid mistakes my father did.

47:12.454 --> 47:15.414
He did terrible, monstrous things.

47:15.415 --> 47:18.210
And now he is paying the price for it.

47:19.211 --> 47:22.464
Markus, there is no saving him
from justice.

47:23.048 --> 47:24.299
That is the real truth.

47:25.133 --> 47:27.886
And it's foolish to become
monsters ourselves trying to.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.391
I will lead the Balas
back to respectability.

47:32.933 --> 47:33.809
To power.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.062
I am the head of this family now,
and you will respect that.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.773
You will follow me.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.900
Together, you and I

47:42.901 --> 47:45.821
will bring peace and prosperity
to our people.

47:46.405 --> 47:47.822
- Our people?
- Yes.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.576
When was the last time
you considered us your people?

47:52.411 --> 47:54.663
Uncle Viktor was hurt at first

47:55.497 --> 47:58.125
when you stopped coming back home
from boarding school.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.877
He put on a show for the rest of them.

48:00.878 --> 48:04.505
"My boy Tomás,
out to conquer the Western world."

48:04.506 --> 48:06.133
"Beat them at their own game."

48:07.593 --> 48:08.927
But I knew the truth.

48:10.345 --> 48:11.638
You abandoned him.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.473
You abandoned us,

48:14.349 --> 48:15.309
your people.

48:15.934 --> 48:18.769
I knew that before your father did,
but he came to accept it.

48:18.770 --> 48:22.023
Markus, that is bloody enough.
Let me out of here right now.

48:22.024 --> 48:25.484
You were never worthy of the Bala name.

48:25.485 --> 48:28.654
I knew that,
and eventually, he came to know it too.

48:28.655 --> 48:30.157
You fucking animal.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.786
You won't be forgiven!

and he heard me."

48:43.253 --> 48:44.087

48:44.796 --> 48:48.799
"Deliver my soul from lying lips,
from a deceitful tongue."

48:48.800 --> 48:50.259
What are you muttering about?

48:50.260 --> 48:52.346
[suspenseful music playing]

48:54.306 --> 48:56.016
"What shall be given unto thee?"
