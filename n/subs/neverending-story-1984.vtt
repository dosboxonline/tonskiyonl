03:03.846 --> 03:06.461
Morning, Bastian.
Morning, Dad.

03:06.471 --> 03:07.964
Oh!

03:25.846 --> 03:27.387
I had another dream, Dad.

03:28.805 --> 03:30.297
About Mom.

03:33.971 --> 03:35.464
I understand, son.

03:37.721 --> 03:40.174
But we have to get on
with things, right?

03:53.096 --> 03:55.253
Bastian, we each have
responsibilities.

03:57.721 --> 04:00.420
We can't let Mom's death...

04:00.430 --> 04:03.463
..be an excuse for not
getting the old job done, right?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.172
Yeah.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.962
Son, I think it's time
you and I had a little talk.

04:28.513 --> 04:31.795
I got a call from your
math teacher yesterday.

04:39.063 --> 04:43.845
She says that you were drawing
horses in your math book.

04:43.855 --> 04:46.595
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

04:46.605 --> 04:47.718
What?

04:49.688 --> 04:51.230
Nothing.

04:53.630 --> 04:56.960
She also says you haven't been
turning in your homework on time.

05:00.796 --> 05:04.079
And I'm very disappointed you didn't
try out for the swimming team.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.370
As to those riding lessons
you wanted, you say you love horses

05:10.380 --> 05:13.959
and yet you seem to be afraid
to get on a real one.

05:16.588 --> 05:20.536
Now, Bastian, you're old enough to
get your head down out of the clouds

05:20.546 --> 05:23.994
and start keeping both feet
on the ground, right?

05:27.088 --> 05:28.088
OK.

05:35.755 --> 05:39.328
Stop daydreaming...
start facing your problems.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.203
OK?

05:41.213 --> 05:42.871
OK.
OK.

05:45.130 --> 05:50.036
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

05:50.046 --> 05:52.161
We should have more.

05:52.171 --> 05:55.620
You have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

05:55.630 --> 05:58.497
But yesterday I wasn't.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.455
Hey, it's the weirdo.

06:24.921 --> 06:27.540
Hey, weirdo,
got any cash for us today?

06:32.335 --> 06:33.835
Come on wimp

06:35.213 --> 06:37.703
Let's get him!
Yeah!

06:37.713 --> 06:39.206
Hey!

06:43.838 --> 06:46.042
You're dead, weirdo!

06:51.421 --> 06:53.286
You can't get away, you jerk!

06:53.296 --> 06:56.164
You're dead, chicken!
We're gonna get you!

06:59.671 --> 07:01.911
Where's your money, man?
I don't have any!

07:01.921 --> 07:04.126
No money?
Mama's boy's holding out on us.

07:05.213 --> 07:09.370
If you ain't got no money on ya,
you can go in the garbage can.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.921
No!

07:13.046 --> 07:15.084
Yeah, alright!
Way to go!

07:16.755 --> 07:19.505
Maybe the chicken
can lay an egg in there.

07:28.213 --> 07:31.078
Hey, who said you could
get out of the garbage?

07:31.088 --> 07:34.003
Get back in there!
No, not again.

07:34.713 --> 07:37.166
No, not again!
Where do you think you're going?!

07:46.463 --> 07:48.286
He went that way!
Which way?

07:48.296 --> 07:50.296
That way!

07:54.171 --> 07:56.541
MAN: Get outta here!
I don't like kids.

08:22.588 --> 08:24.953
Are you still here?
Didn't you hear me?

08:24.963 --> 08:27.661
Um... I was...
You're hiding, aren't you?

08:27.671 --> 08:31.286
No, I was just...
The video arcade is down the street.

08:31.296 --> 08:35.035
Here we just sell small rectangular
objects. They're called books.

08:35.046 --> 08:39.495
They require a little effort on
your part and make no b-b-b-b-beeps.

08:39.505 --> 08:42.120
On your way, please.
I know books.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.285
I have 186 of them at home.

08:44.296 --> 08:45.953
Ah... comic books.

08:45.963 --> 08:48.828
No, I've read `Treasure Island',
`The Last of the Mohicans',

08:48.838 --> 08:50.786
`Wizard of Oz', `Lord of the Rings',

08:50.796 --> 08:52.620
`20,000 Leagues Under the Sea',
`Tarzan'...

08:52.630 --> 08:53.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:53.713 --> 08:55.885
Come.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.544
Who were you running away from?

09:05.463 --> 09:08.505
Um... just some kids from school.

09:09.805 --> 09:11.079
Why?

09:11.838 --> 09:13.786
They wanna throw me in the garbage.

09:13.796 --> 09:17.495
Why don't you give 'em
a good punch in the nose? Hmm?

09:17.505 --> 09:20.337
Well... I don't know.

09:34.046 --> 09:35.954
What's that book about?

09:37.338 --> 09:40.906
Oh, this is something special.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.956
Well, what is it?

09:52.338 --> 09:56.663
Look, your books are safe.

09:58.421 --> 10:05.370
By reading them you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.453
But that's what I like about them.

10:07.463 --> 10:11.620
Ah, but afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

10:11.630 --> 10:13.336
What... what do you mean?

10:14.421 --> 10:15.914
Listen...

10:17.963 --> 10:25.578
..have you ever been Captain Nemo,
trapped inside your submarine

10:25.588 --> 10:27.993
while the giant squid
is attacking you?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.453
Yes.

10:31.463 --> 10:34.203
Weren't you afraid
you couldnâ€™t escape?

10:34.213 --> 10:36.411
But it's only a story.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.708
That's what I'm talking about.

10:40.005 --> 10:42.872
The ones you read are safe.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.039
And that one isn't?

10:50.630 --> 10:52.380
Don't worry about it.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.529
What's so different about it?

10:58.953 --> 11:00.044
Nothing

11:00.054 --> 11:01.552
But... but you just said it was...

11:10.563 --> 11:12.636
Forget about it.

11:12.646 --> 11:15.810
This book is not for you.

11:25.396 --> 11:27.678
Koreander's.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.011
Oh, yes. What can I do for you?

11:32.605 --> 11:37.053
No, I don't have it.
But I can find it for you.

11:37.063 --> 11:42.095
Well... their run may be 300, 375.

11:42.105 --> 11:44.938
Might take me a couple of weeks.

11:49.238 --> 11:50.517
Goodbye.

12:05.035 --> 12:08.035
Don't be angry, I'll bring back soon

12:45.921 --> 12:49.121
BASTIAN: Math test. Oh, no.

14:13.063 --> 14:16.886
<i>It was midnight
in the Howling Forest.</i>

14:16.896 --> 14:21.053
<i>The wind whistled through the tops
of the ancient trees.</i>

14:21.063 --> 14:23.428
<i>Suddenly, something enormous</i>

14:23.438 --> 14:27.432
<i>crashed and rumbled
through the eerie woods.</i>

14:53.396 --> 14:54.396
What's that?

15:02.230 --> 15:03.722
Ah!

15:30.688 --> 15:37.301
Excuse me. Would it be alright
if I joined you this evening?

15:38.938 --> 15:43.228
You see, I've been traveling
all day.

15:57.063 --> 15:58.604
Arggh!

16:01.730 --> 16:04.678
Mmm

16:04.688 --> 16:08.761
Aha!

16:08.771 --> 16:14.553
Now I see why you picked this camp.
Now...

16:14.563 --> 16:16.303
Oh... oh...

16:16.313 --> 16:18.636
Oh. Oh, no!
Oh...

16:24.355 --> 16:28.146
A delicious-looking limestone rock.

16:31.355 --> 16:33.970
Nice bouquet.

16:33.980 --> 16:38.021
Must be a real vintage year.

16:39.646 --> 16:41.845
Yes, you are right.

16:41.855 --> 16:44.604
Those delicious rocks are the reason
we camped here, alright.

16:47.021 --> 16:48.803
Is he... a nut case?

16:48.813 --> 16:51.846
No, he's a rock biter.
A rock bi... A rock biter?!

16:57.563 --> 16:59.056
Hey!

17:00.230 --> 17:02.434
Now...

17:06.771 --> 17:09.011
Oops. Sorry.

17:09.021 --> 17:10.063
Poor baby.

17:14.646 --> 17:22.646
Pardon me. Mmm... that was Limestone
with a dash of quartz.

17:23.646 --> 17:26.053
Very tasty.

17:26.063 --> 17:28.928
Where I come from in the north

17:28.938 --> 17:31.396
we used to have exquisite
gourmet rocks.

17:33.938 --> 17:38.678
Only now... now...

17:38.688 --> 17:41.178
..they're all gone.

17:41.188 --> 17:43.803
I know how it happened.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.011
Ooh! I... I swear it wasn't me.

17:47.021 --> 17:48.636
Ha! No.

17:48.646 --> 17:51.511
I think I know what it was.
Tell us more.

17:51.521 --> 17:56.595
Near my home, there used to be
a beautiful lake.

17:56.605 --> 18:01.761
But then... then it... it was gone.

18:01.771 --> 18:04.428
Did the Lake dry up?

18:04.438 --> 18:07.470
No, it just wasn't there anymore.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.928
Nothing was there anymore.

18:09.938 --> 18:12.636
Not even a dried-up Lake.

18:12.646 --> 18:15.636
A hole?
A hole would be something.

18:15.646 --> 18:18.886
No, it was nothing.

18:18.896 --> 18:22.396
And it got bigger and bigger.

18:23.646 --> 18:29.975
First, there was no Lake anymore,
and then finally... no rocks.

18:36.355 --> 18:38.636
If he keeps stuffing his face
like that

18:38.646 --> 18:41.011
soon there won't be
any rocks here either.

18:41.021 --> 18:45.095
Night Hob, this could be serious!

18:45.105 --> 18:47.053
Rock Biter, what you have told us

18:47.063 --> 18:49.553
is also happening
where I live in the west.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.720
A strange sort of nothing
is destroying everything.

18:52.730 --> 18:57.386
Yes. We night hobs Live in
the south, and it's there too.

18:57.396 --> 19:04.303
So... it's... it's... not just
in our part of Fantasia?

19:04.313 --> 19:08.438
Maybe...
..it's already everywhere.

19:15.230 --> 19:18.886
Maybe our whole land is in danger.
Uh-huh.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.428
What can we do?

19:20.438 --> 19:25.428
My people are sending me to the Ivory
Tower, to the Empress for help.

19:25.438 --> 19:28.261
BOTH: We are on the same...
Shh.

19:28.271 --> 19:30.136
We are on the same mission.

19:30.146 --> 19:34.521
After all, if the Empress
can't save us, who could?

19:35.021 --> 19:37.970
Then why are we all
just sitting around here

19:37.980 --> 19:40.220
instead of taking off
for the Ivory Tower?

19:40.230 --> 19:43.011
Right! What are we waiting for?

19:43.021 --> 19:45.386
Yes! Yes! Let's go now.

19:45.396 --> 19:46.636
Hey, wake up.

19:46.646 --> 19:48.386
Come on, old girl.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.019
We can't just hang around here.

19:51.605 --> 19:53.428
Wake up. Ready for take-off.

19:53.438 --> 19:55.553
Oh, stupid bat!

19:55.563 --> 20:00.345
We can't wait for a snail.
Can I carry you?

20:00.355 --> 20:02.970
Don't worry, it's a racing snail.

20:02.980 --> 20:08.761
Oh. But we can't even wait
for a racing snail.

20:08.771 --> 20:10.428
Tally-ho!

20:10.438 --> 20:14.178
Hey... it really is a racing snail.

20:14.188 --> 20:17.518
And nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

20:28.063 --> 20:34.178
Maybe I'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks for the road.

20:43.105 --> 20:44.645
Oh, no.

20:58.355 --> 20:59.847
The Nothing.

22:17.521 --> 22:20.053
Look!

22:20.063 --> 22:22.386
There it is.

22:22.396 --> 22:24.517
The heart of Fantasia.

22:45.646 --> 22:50.355
I NEVER knew it was that beautiful.

22:59.521 --> 23:01.014
Ohhh.

23:06.438 --> 23:08.594
Stay awake!

23:11.313 --> 23:13.138
I told you to stay awake.

24:00.646 --> 24:02.602
The home of the Empress.

24:03.980 --> 24:05.769
She's our only hope.

24:39.396 --> 24:42.643
Friends, I know why you are all here.

24:44.063 --> 24:45.556
The Nothing...

24:48.188 --> 24:50.271
..is destroying our world.

24:52.730 --> 25:00.730
I also know that you have come
to beseech... the Empress for help.

25:03.563 --> 25:06.763
But I... I have terrible news.

25:10.563 --> 25:13.303
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

25:13.313 --> 25:14.313
Ooh.

25:16.021 --> 25:21.093
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.553
She's dying.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.813
So she cannot save... us.

25:36.771 --> 25:38.809
But there just might be one chance.

25:43.396 --> 25:47.845
The plainspeople who hunt
the purple buffalo have among them

25:47.855 --> 25:49.386
a great warrior,

25:49.396 --> 25:53.472
and he alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

25:55.313 --> 25:56.806
He is our only hope.

25:59.521 --> 26:02.887
His name... is Atreyu.

26:22.105 --> 26:23.811
Atreyu.

26:33.230 --> 26:37.761
<i>The Empress had already
sent for the great warrior.</i>

26:37.771 --> 26:42.178
<i>When he finally appeared
on the terrace of the Ivory Tower,</i>

26:42.188 --> 26:46.896
<i>he carried with him
the hopes of all Fantasia.</i>

27:03.896 --> 27:06.345
A Little boy.

27:06.355 --> 27:10.886
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.428
I must ask you to leave.

27:13.438 --> 27:16.813
If you don't want me here,
you shouldnâ€™t have sent for me.

27:19.563 --> 27:23.178
Is he a nut case?
It was not you we sent for.

27:23.188 --> 27:25.855
We wanted Atreyu.
I AM Atreyu.

27:27.730 --> 27:32.095
Not Atreyu the child -
Atreyu the warrior!

27:32.105 --> 27:34.553
I'm the only Atreyu
of the plainspeople.

27:34.563 --> 27:37.680
But I'll be happy to go back
hunting the purple buffalo.

27:40.063 --> 27:41.805
No. Wait!

27:44.980 --> 27:46.603
Come back, please.

27:57.855 --> 28:00.886
If you really ARE
the Atreyu we sent for,

28:00.896 --> 28:03.894
you would be willing
to go on a quest.

28:06.188 --> 28:07.811
Yes. Of course.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.136
What kind of a quest?

28:11.146 --> 28:13.469
To find a cure for the Empress.

28:15.896 --> 28:17.980
And to save our world.

28:19.521 --> 28:22.852
No-one can give you
any advice except this.

28:24.646 --> 28:30.181
You must go alone, you must
Leave all your weapons behind.

28:32.688 --> 28:34.809
It will be very dangerous.

28:36.396 --> 28:38.719
Is there any chance of success?

28:40.105 --> 28:41.803
I do not know.

28:41.813 --> 28:46.470
But if you fail,
the Empress will surely die.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.687
And our whole world
will be utterly destroyed.

29:11.313 --> 29:13.220
When do I begin?

29:14.396 --> 29:15.928
Now.

29:15.938 --> 29:17.720
And you must hurry, Atreyu.

29:17.730 --> 29:19.980
The Nothing grows
stronger every day.

29:26.230 --> 29:27.722
Take this.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.344
The AURYN.

29:44.563 --> 29:49.386
He who wears the AURYN
speaks for the Empress.

29:49.396 --> 29:53.058
It will guide and protect you.

30:08.605 --> 30:11.519
Wake up!
Farewell, Atreyu!

30:12.688 --> 30:14.679
Take care.

30:40.063 --> 30:43.761
<i>At the same time,
elsewhere in Fantasia,</i>

30:43.771 --> 30:48.605
<i>a creature of darkness
also began his quest.</i>

31:33.688 --> 31:37.720
<i>They had been traveling aimlessly
for almost a week,</i>

31:37.730 --> 31:40.928
<i>but they could not find
a cure for the Empress.</i>

31:40.938 --> 31:44.178
<i>Neither Atreyu,
nor his horse, Artax,</i>

31:44.188 --> 31:49.845
<i>had the vaguest suspicion that
the creature of darkness, the Gmork,</i>

31:49.855 --> 31:53.063
<i>was already tracking them down.</i>

32:00.813 --> 32:04.220
What? What is it, Artax?

32:04.230 --> 32:06.188
Is it time to...

32:10.396 --> 32:15.137
I know what you want.
It's time to eat. Hmm?

32:17.646 --> 32:19.636
Good idea.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.016
No. It's a GREAT idea!

32:41.396 --> 32:44.803
No. Not too much.

32:44.813 --> 32:48.226
<i>We still have a LONG way to go.</i>

33:47.163 --> 33:51.153
<i>Atreyu and Artax had searched
the Silver Mountains,</i>

33:51.163 --> 33:55.028
<i>the Desert of Shattered Hopes,
and the Crystal Towers</i>

33:55.038 --> 33:56.945
<i>without success.</i>

33:56.955 --> 34:00.445
<i>And so, there was
only one chance left.</i>

34:00.455 --> 34:04.236
<i>To find Morla, the Ancient One,</i>

34:04.246 --> 34:06.986
<i>the wisest being in Fantasia,</i>

34:06.996 --> 34:09.902
<i>whose home was the Shell Mountain,</i>

34:09.913 --> 34:14.369
<i>somewhere in the deadly
Swamps of Sadness.</i>

34:28.338 --> 34:30.795
Come on, boy. Come on.

34:42.621 --> 34:46.069
That's the boy. That's the boy.

34:48.455 --> 34:49.996
It's OK.

34:57.288 --> 34:58.994
You're doing fine, Artax.

35:03.830 --> 35:05.453
That's right.

35:13.788 --> 35:15.695
Come on, Artax.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.153
What's the matter?

35:23.163 --> 35:25.533
What's wrong?

35:31.871 --> 35:33.447
Come on, boy!

35:35.871 --> 35:37.661
What's the matter?

35:38.788 --> 35:40.695
I understand.

35:45.330 --> 35:46.953
It's too difficult for you.

35:55.163 --> 35:57.361
Artax! You're sinking!

35:57.371 --> 35:59.278
Come on! Turn around!

35:59.288 --> 36:01.195
You have to! NOW!

36:03.163 --> 36:06.403
COME ON! ARTAX!

36:06.413 --> 36:08.404
Fight against the Sadness, Artax!

36:10.496 --> 36:13.445
Artax, please.

36:13.455 --> 36:16.278
You're letting the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

36:16.288 --> 36:17.945
You have to try.

36:17.955 --> 36:19.986
You have to care.

36:19.996 --> 36:21.903
For me.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.820
You're my friend.

36:23.830 --> 36:26.153
I love you.

36:28.538 --> 36:32.278
ARTAX! STUPID HORSE!

36:32.288 --> 36:34.653
You've gotta move, or you'll die!

36:34.663 --> 36:37.778
Move, please!

36:37.788 --> 36:40.111
I won't give up! Come, quick!

36:40.121 --> 36:42.278
ARTAX!

38:17.621 --> 38:19.529
The Shell Mountain.

38:25.705 --> 38:29.070
Morla. The Ancient One.

39:24.705 --> 39:26.236
Morla!

39:26.246 --> 39:28.367
Morla!

40:14.955 --> 40:16.486
Mmm.

40:16.496 --> 40:17.830
Arggh!

40:26.746 --> 40:29.863
Huh?
Huh?

40:31.871 --> 40:34.028
But that's impossible!

40:34.038 --> 40:37.195
They couldnâ€™t have heard me.

40:37.205 --> 40:39.111
Are you Morla?

40:39.121 --> 40:40.705
The Ancient One?

40:45.371 --> 40:51.278
Not that it matters, but yes.

40:51.288 --> 40:52.945
Please help me, Morla!

40:52.955 --> 40:55.153
Do you recognize this?

40:55.163 --> 40:57.486
Well...

40:57.496 --> 41:01.528
..we haven't seen the AURYN

41:01.538 --> 41:05.111
in a long time.

41:05.121 --> 41:06.614
We?

41:08.163 --> 41:10.278
Is there someone else here too?

41:10.288 --> 41:14.986
We haven't spoken to anyone else

41:14.996 --> 41:18.861
for thousands of years.

41:18.871 --> 41:25.663
So, we started talking to ourselves.

41:34.835 --> 41:36.940
AH-CHOO!

41:45.330 --> 41:47.236
Morla, I bring terrible news!

41:47.246 --> 41:49.913
Did you know that
the Empress is very ill?

41:52.913 --> 41:57.378
Not that it matters, but yes.

41:57.388 --> 42:01.045
Actually, we don't care.

42:01.055 --> 42:03.086
If I don't save her, she'll die!

42:03.096 --> 42:05.711
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the Land!

42:05.721 --> 42:07.153
Don't you care about that?

42:07.163 --> 42:09.736
We don't even care

42:09.746 --> 42:13.746
whether or not we care.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.611
Do you have a cold?

42:22.621 --> 42:24.580
No.

42:25.080 --> 42:29.621
We're allergic to you.

42:32.705 --> 42:34.246
AH-CHOO!

42:35.746 --> 42:38.528
You know how I can help
the Empress, don't you?

42:38.538 --> 42:41.361
Not that it matters,

42:41.371 --> 42:43.736
but yes.

42:43.746 --> 42:47.528
If you don't tell me, and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too!

42:47.538 --> 42:49.070
BOTH of you!

42:49.080 --> 42:51.080
Die?

42:53.080 --> 42:58.288
That, at least, would be something.

43:10.663 --> 43:12.236
Please help me.

43:12.246 --> 43:14.278
You said you knew the...
AH-CHOO!

43:14.288 --> 43:20.028
We're tired of sneezing. Go away.

43:20.038 --> 43:23.403
Nothing matters.
That's not true!

43:23.413 --> 43:26.205
If it didn't really matter,
you could tell me.

43:29.371 --> 43:31.736
Clever boy.

43:31.746 --> 43:33.903
TELL ME, PLEASE!

43:33.913 --> 43:36.121
We don't know.

43:37.121 --> 43:43.195
But you can ask the Southern Oracle.

43:43.205 --> 43:44.736
How can I get there?

43:44.746 --> 43:47.153
You can't.

43:47.163 --> 43:52.863
It's 10,000 miles away.

43:58.330 --> 44:00.320
But that's so far.

44:00.330 --> 44:02.611
That's right.

44:02.621 --> 44:05.861
Forget it.

44:05.871 --> 44:11.074
Goodbye.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.653
No.

45:51.663 --> 45:54.033
Atreyu wouldnâ€™t quit now.

47:37.288 --> 47:39.326
Oh, boy.

47:49.205 --> 47:52.695
<i>After days and nights
of unconsciousness,</i>

47:52.705 --> 47:55.903
<i>Atreyu slowly opened his eyes,</i>

47:55.913 --> 48:00.445
<i>and found himself
in strange surroundings.</i>

48:00.455 --> 48:04.069
<i>He was clean,
and his wounds were dressed.</i>

48:15.288 --> 48:16.913
Huh?

49:09.955 --> 49:12.526
Leaving so soon?

49:17.955 --> 49:19.653
Hmm?

49:19.663 --> 49:22.236
I was just going to...

49:22.246 --> 49:24.611
I...have to...

49:24.621 --> 49:26.695
I was trying to s...
Sneak away?

49:26.705 --> 49:28.361
Yeah.

49:28.371 --> 49:31.403
I mean, no. No!
I LIKE children.

49:31.413 --> 49:34.695
For breakfast?

49:34.705 --> 49:36.361
Never.

49:36.371 --> 49:38.653
I'm a luckdragon.

49:38.663 --> 49:40.986
My name is Falkor.

49:40.996 --> 49:43.653
And my name is...
Atreyu.

49:43.663 --> 49:45.278
And you're on a quest.

49:45.288 --> 49:46.820
How'd you know that?

49:46.830 --> 49:49.111
You were unconscious.

49:49.121 --> 49:52.945
And you talked in your sleep.

49:52.955 --> 49:54.528
What?

49:54.538 --> 50:01.570
Could you... get round...
and scratch behind my right ear?

50:01.580 --> 50:05.620
I can never quite reach it.

50:11.246 --> 50:13.945
Here?
Ah.

50:13.955 --> 50:15.746
Yeah.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.403
That's SO good.

50:26.413 --> 50:28.569
Thank you.

50:30.496 --> 50:32.455
So, Little fella,

50:32.955 --> 50:36.403
you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

50:36.413 --> 50:39.153
Yes. But it's hopeless!

50:39.163 --> 50:40.695
It's too far away!

50:40.705 --> 50:43.403
Oh, I wouldnâ€™t necessarily say that.

50:43.413 --> 50:46.028
You... you know how to get there?

50:46.038 --> 50:47.945
Why, sure.

50:47.955 --> 50:49.736
It's right around the corner.

50:49.746 --> 50:51.486
How did all this happen?!

50:51.496 --> 50:55.028
With luck.

50:55.038 --> 50:58.945
You've already brought me
the entire 10,000 miles?

50:58.955 --> 51:05.028
No. Only 9,891.

51:05.038 --> 51:07.070
As the dragon flies.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.028
You're amazing!

51:09.038 --> 51:14.778
Having a Luckdragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

51:14.788 --> 51:17.903
Things will work out fine, Atreyu.

51:17.913 --> 51:23.329
Never give up,
and good Luck will find you.

51:28.163 --> 51:30.236
It's good to have a friend again.

51:30.246 --> 51:33.445
Mmm.

51:33.455 --> 51:35.659
You have more than one.

51:37.705 --> 51:39.530
Look.

52:39.746 --> 52:42.070
Get out of my light, wench!

52:42.080 --> 52:44.820
You're disturbing
my scientific work!

52:44.830 --> 52:47.820
You and your scientific work!

52:47.830 --> 52:51.778
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions!

52:51.788 --> 52:55.861
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

52:55.871 --> 52:57.445
Yes, yes.

52:57.455 --> 52:59.361
But not until he's well.

52:59.371 --> 53:02.663
Get back to your own room.
I'm going this way.

53:03.163 --> 53:06.771
I'm always finding you in MY place.

53:06.871 --> 53:10.246
Ah! He's well.

53:10.746 --> 53:13.820
Now it's MY turn with him.

53:13.830 --> 53:17.403
Oh, no, you don't!
I decide when he's well.

53:17.413 --> 53:19.866
It's your turn
when I say it's your turn.

53:23.996 --> 53:26.486
Well, Little man. Still in pain?

53:26.496 --> 53:28.111
Mmm... a Little. But it's alright.

53:28.121 --> 53:29.736
I like that!

53:29.746 --> 53:32.730
The patient telling
the doctor it's alright?

53:33.331 --> 53:36.005
It's all right, when I say it's all right

53:37.030 --> 53:38.996
It has to hurt if it's to heal!

53:41.996 --> 53:45.658
Here. Drink that.

53:48.663 --> 53:50.320
Good, mmm?

53:50.330 --> 53:52.621
That's my batwing broth.

53:53.121 --> 53:55.236
There's eye of newt in there.

53:55.246 --> 53:56.778
Tree mold, old lizard brains,

53:56.788 --> 54:00.455
scales from a rancid sea serpent!

54:00.530 --> 54:04.320
Flavored with sand worms

54:04.330 --> 54:06.330
Organic grown of course

54:07.455 --> 54:11.153
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

54:11.163 --> 54:13.736
What are you onto?

54:13.746 --> 54:16.871
Anything of interest to
the scientific community?

54:16.946 --> 54:19.846
He thinks he is scientific community

54:19.871 --> 54:22.945
My name's Atreyu. I came here
to find the Southern Oracle.

54:22.955 --> 54:24.903
Oooh...
Here we go again!

54:24.913 --> 54:27.986
You've come
to the right place, my boy.

54:27.996 --> 54:31.236
I am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

54:31.246 --> 54:34.361
It is my scientific specialty.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.205
It's my scientific specialty!

54:40.205 --> 54:45.070
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

54:45.080 --> 54:47.320
YOU keep quiet, wench!
Oooh!

54:47.330 --> 54:49.155
It's now MY turn.

54:51.580 --> 54:54.903
My name is Engywook. She's Urgl.

54:54.913 --> 54:57.195
Ever heard of me?
I don't think so.

54:57.205 --> 55:00.903
Oh. You don't move
in scientific circles.

55:00.913 --> 55:04.111
I am the expert
on the Southern Oracle!

55:04.121 --> 55:06.986
Oooh... you've come
to the right place, my boy!

55:06.996 --> 55:09.403
There's no fool like an old fool.

55:09.413 --> 55:11.778
Wait! Stay here.

55:11.788 --> 55:14.236
The observatory!

55:14.246 --> 55:16.071
To the winch, wench!

55:21.413 --> 55:23.195
Come on, lazybones!

55:23.205 --> 55:25.080
Can't you go any faster?!

55:26.955 --> 55:31.153
I've been studying the mysteries
of the Southern Oracle for years.

55:31.163 --> 55:33.236
Someday, I'll publish my book.

55:33.246 --> 55:35.861
`A Century of Studying
the Southern Oracle'

55:35.871 --> 55:37.528
<i>by Professor Engywook.</i>

55:37.538 --> 55:39.493
Volume 1, `The Early Years'.

55:40.955 --> 55:43.195
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

55:43.205 --> 55:45.445
Eh... what do YOU think?

55:45.455 --> 55:47.538
I work scientifically!

56:17.246 --> 56:18.869
Look!

56:26.496 --> 56:28.945
Is that the Southern Oracle?

56:28.955 --> 56:30.570
Oh, no!

56:30.580 --> 56:33.861
It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through

56:33.871 --> 56:35.653
before you reach
the Southern Oracle

56:35.663 --> 56:39.278
and get me the final information
for my book!

56:40.871 --> 56:44.236
Of course, most people...

56:44.246 --> 56:47.820
..never get that far.

56:47.830 --> 56:49.361
Why?

56:49.371 --> 56:52.528
The sphinxes' eyes stay closed

56:52.538 --> 56:57.528
until someone who does not
feel his own worth tries to pass by.

57:06.621 --> 57:09.454
Here comes one that LOOKS fancy.

57:15.163 --> 57:18.195
Let's see what he REALLY
thinks of himself.

57:18.205 --> 57:19.745
Look. Look!

57:23.788 --> 57:26.153
Hee! Hee!

57:26.163 --> 57:28.945
Go on, scaredy-cat!

57:28.955 --> 57:30.611
Oh, go ON!

57:30.621 --> 57:33.903
Oh, it's my turn. Let me see.

57:33.913 --> 57:35.861
I'M the scientist!

57:35.871 --> 57:37.412
He's going on.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.403
I think he's gonna make it!

57:40.413 --> 57:44.070
The sphinxes' eyes -
are they open or shut?

57:44.080 --> 57:45.820
Let me see!

57:45.830 --> 57:47.571
They're shut.

57:49.330 --> 57:53.496
No, wait! The eyes are opening!

57:58.080 --> 58:00.538
Oh, no!

58:08.538 --> 58:11.619
Did he make it? Did he?

58:14.038 --> 58:15.531
No.

58:17.746 --> 58:20.195
Fancy Armour doesn't help.

58:20.205 --> 58:25.739
The sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

58:29.080 --> 58:30.695
Listen, boy!

58:30.705 --> 58:33.987
Next time, Let ME see what happens!
It's MY telescope!

58:38.496 --> 58:40.570
I'm gonna try it.
No!

58:40.580 --> 58:42.236
Don't go yet!

58:42.246 --> 58:44.528
I've not told you
about the next gate!

58:44.538 --> 58:46.611
It's even WORSE than this one!

58:46.621 --> 58:48.445
Atreyu!

58:48.455 --> 58:50.413
Atreyu!

59:25.330 --> 59:27.903
Oh... he'll never make it!

59:27.913 --> 59:29.536
He'll never make it!

01:01:01.538 --> 01:01:03.070
Oh, no!

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.994
Don't start to doubt yourself!
Be confident!

01:01:11.371 --> 01:01:14.453
Be confident! Be confident!

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:23.611
RUN, ATREYU! RUN!

01:01:23.621 --> 01:01:25.363
RUN, ATREYU!

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.404
RUN! NOW!

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:47.528
He made it! He made it!

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:50.027
He made it!

01:01:53.788 --> 01:01:56.611
He made it!

01:01:56.621 --> 01:01:58.529
He made it!

01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:02.320
Arggh!

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.153
It has to hurt if it's to heal!

01:02:05.163 --> 01:02:06.695
He made it!

01:02:06.705 --> 01:02:10.736
Atreyu! He made it
through the Sphinx Gate!

01:02:10.746 --> 01:02:13.861
I always said he could do it.
Oh, good!

01:02:13.871 --> 01:02:18.778
But that's no reason for you
to fall out of the basket again.

01:02:18.788 --> 01:02:21.903
Oh.
I knew he would be safe.

01:02:21.913 --> 01:02:23.445
Nonsense!

01:02:23.455 --> 01:02:25.986
You don't understand anything!

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:28.820
The worst one is coming up.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.195
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

01:02:32.205 --> 01:02:35.695
Atreyu has to face his true self!

01:02:35.705 --> 01:02:37.236
So what?

01:02:37.246 --> 01:02:39.778
That won't be too hard for him.
Oh!

01:02:39.788 --> 01:02:42.278
That's what EVERYONE thinks.

01:02:42.288 --> 01:02:45.820
But kind people
find that they are cruel.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:50.361
Brave men discover
that they are really cowards!

01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:57.079
Confronted with their true selves,
most men run away screaming!

01:05:02.455 --> 01:05:04.694
This is going too far.

01:05:24.413 --> 01:05:26.028
What if they...

01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:29.735
..really DO know about me
in Fantasia?

01:06:18.246 --> 01:06:20.616
The Southern Oracle?

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.278
WOMEN: Do not be afraid.

01:06:42.288 --> 01:06:45.239
We will not harm you.

01:06:46.913 --> 01:06:53.277
We have been waiting for you
a long time, Atreyu.

01:06:55.996 --> 01:06:57.903
Are you the Southern Oracle?

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.736
Yes. We are.

01:07:00.746 --> 01:07:04.320
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia!

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:07.820
Yes. We do.

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.903
Well, what is it?

01:07:09.913 --> 01:07:11.820
I have to know!

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:18.821
The Empress needs a new name.

01:07:20.496 --> 01:07:21.989
A new name?

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.778
That's all?

01:07:24.788 --> 01:07:26.653
But that's easy!

01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:30.403
I can give her any name she wants!

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:35.820
No-one from Fantasia can do it.

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.653
Only a human child

01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:43.496
can give her this new name.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:50.820
A human child? Where can I find one?

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:54.736
You can only find one

01:07:54.746 --> 01:07:59.487
beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.361
If you want to save our world,

01:08:07.371 --> 01:08:10.073
you must hurry!

01:08:12.705 --> 01:08:16.653
We don't know how much longer

01:08:16.662 --> 01:08:19.282
we can withstand the Nothing.

01:08:22.871 --> 01:08:24.903
FALKOR!

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:27.615
FALKOR!

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.611
Hurry, Falkor!
The Nothing's everywhere!

01:08:47.621 --> 01:08:49.444
Don't worry.

01:08:49.455 --> 01:08:53.611
We'll reach
the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:08:53.621 --> 01:08:58.403
Do you know where they are?
I have NO idea.

01:08:58.412 --> 01:09:00.694
Then how do we find a human child?

01:09:00.705 --> 01:09:04.319
With luck!

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:07.278
Faster, Falkor. Faster!
We have to hurry!

01:09:07.287 --> 01:09:10.787
Alright! Hang on tight!

01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:22.363
Yeah!

01:09:33.205 --> 01:09:35.242
Whoa!

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.153
Wahoo!

01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:07.363
Wow! Whoa!

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.736
What a shame they don't ask me.

01:10:45.746 --> 01:10:51.530
My mother, she had
such a wonderful name.

01:11:06.913 --> 01:11:08.570
<i>On and on they flew,</i>

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.861
<i>until they reached
the Sea of Possibilities,</i>

01:11:11.871 --> 01:11:14.330
<i>where they could go no further.</i>

01:11:16.455 --> 01:11:19.663
FALKOR: Look, Atreyu. The Nothing!

01:11:25.496 --> 01:11:28.205
Hang on!

01:11:48.455 --> 01:11:49.986
Falkor!

01:11:49.996 --> 01:11:52.947
Atreyu!

01:12:25.913 --> 01:12:27.406
Atreyu!

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.450
FALKOR!

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.195
FALKOR! WHERE ARE YOU?!

01:13:08.205 --> 01:13:10.195
Falkor!

01:13:29.163 --> 01:13:32.788
Atreyu! Where are you?!

01:13:33.788 --> 01:13:36.572
Atreyu!

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.987
Falkor!

01:13:44.955 --> 01:13:46.871
Falkor.

01:13:49.871 --> 01:13:53.319
Atreyu!

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:32.070
They look like big, good,

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.986
strong hands, don't they?

01:14:36.996 --> 01:14:41.570
I always thought
that's what they were.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.736
My Little friends.

01:14:47.746 --> 01:14:51.153
The Little man
with his racing snail.

01:14:51.163 --> 01:14:53.153
The Night Hob.

01:14:53.163 --> 01:14:56.820
Even the stupid bat.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:00.820
I couldnâ€™t hold on to them.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:08.403
The Nothing pulled them
right out of my hands.

01:15:08.413 --> 01:15:10.820
I failed.

01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:12.403
No, you didn't fail.

01:15:12.413 --> 01:15:14.486
I'm the one who failed.

01:15:14.496 --> 01:15:17.067
I was the one chosen
to stop the Nothing.

01:15:18.788 --> 01:15:20.861
But I lost the AURYN.

01:15:20.871 --> 01:15:22.986
I can't find my luckdragon.

01:15:22.996 --> 01:15:26.942
So I won't be able to get
beyond the boundaries of Fantasia!

01:15:35.746 --> 01:15:37.403
Listen.

01:15:37.413 --> 01:15:41.861
The Nothing will be here any minute.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.070
I will just sit here

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.243
and Let it take me away too.

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:53.945
They look like good,

01:15:53.955 --> 01:16:00.070
strong hands, don't they?

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.621
Mm-hm.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.072
Morla?

01:17:09.455 --> 01:17:11.031
Artax!

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.580
Artax!

01:18:02.835 --> 01:18:05.635
Leave me alone!

01:18:09.005 --> 01:18:10.005
Can I help you?

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.590
If you come any closer...

01:18:13.771 --> 01:18:16.805
..I will rip you to shreds.

01:18:23.188 --> 01:18:24.720
Who are you?

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:27.479
I am the Gmork.

01:18:28.896 --> 01:18:32.761
And you, whoever you are,

01:18:32.771 --> 01:18:37.105
can have the honor of being
my last victim.

01:18:40.105 --> 01:18:42.470
I will not die easily.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.511
I am a warrior.

01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:46.053
Ha!

01:18:46.063 --> 01:18:50.470
Brave warrior.
Then fight the Nothing.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.011
But I can't!

01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:54.271
I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:18:56.896 --> 01:18:58.636
What's so funny about that?

01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:03.021
Fantasia has no boundaries.

01:19:08.563 --> 01:19:10.261
That's not true!

01:19:10.271 --> 01:19:13.139
You're lying!
Foolish boy.

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:18.511
Don't you know anything
about Fantasia?

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:22.432
It's the world of human fantasy!

01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:26.345
Every part,

01:19:26.355 --> 01:19:29.220
every creature of it,

01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:34.886
is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:41.688
Therefore, it has no boundaries.

01:19:48.855 --> 01:19:51.428
But why is Fantasia dying, then?

01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:55.678
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes,

01:19:55.688 --> 01:19:59.636
and forget their dreams.

01:19:59.646 --> 01:20:03.220
So the Nothing grows stronger.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:05.095
What IS the Nothing?

01:20:05.105 --> 01:20:07.807
It's the emptiness that's Left.

01:20:09.313 --> 01:20:14.428
It is like a despair
destroying this world,

01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:19.261
and I have been trying to help it.

01:20:19.271 --> 01:20:20.886
But why?!

01:20:20.896 --> 01:20:28.095
Because people who have no hopes
are easy to control.

01:20:28.105 --> 01:20:31.928
And whoever has the control

01:20:31.938 --> 01:20:35.396
has the power.

01:20:49.813 --> 01:20:51.970
Who are you really?

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.515
I am the servant...

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:58.936
..of the power behind the Nothing.

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:03.803
I was sent to kill the only one

01:21:03.813 --> 01:21:06.845
who could have stopped the Nothing.

01:21:06.855 --> 01:21:10.511
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

01:21:10.521 --> 01:21:14.980
His name... was Atreyu.

01:21:21.935 --> 01:21:24.835
I have stalked him for so long

01:21:26.235 --> 01:21:29.735
I am almost too weak to kill you

01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:34.235
But I will find the strength

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:42.455
Let me give you news strength Gmork

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.636
If we're about to die anyway,

01:21:44.646 --> 01:21:47.136
I'd rather die fighting!

01:21:47.146 --> 01:21:49.220
Come for me, Gmork!

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:50.896
I am Atreyu!

01:23:22.438 --> 01:23:25.140
Falkor!

01:23:27.563 --> 01:23:30.893
Falkor!

01:23:32.813 --> 01:23:34.934
Atreyu!

01:23:42.438 --> 01:23:43.931
Got you!

01:23:56.313 --> 01:23:59.595
<i>That was the end of Fantasia.</i>

01:23:59.605 --> 01:24:05.886
<i>Only a few fragments
of this once rich and beautiful world</i>

01:24:05.896 --> 01:24:07.934
<i>had been Left by the Nothing.</i>

01:24:17.771 --> 01:24:20.053
ATREYU: Good old Falkor.

01:24:20.063 --> 01:24:21.845
Can you see anything?

01:24:21.855 --> 01:24:24.095
Anything at all?

01:24:24.105 --> 01:24:25.886
No.

01:24:25.896 --> 01:24:28.886
All the Land is gone.

01:24:28.896 --> 01:24:30.813
I know.

01:24:31.313 --> 01:24:34.095
And all because I failed.

01:24:34.105 --> 01:24:36.220
You tried.

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:39.053
Do you suppose the Ivory Tower
is still standing?

01:24:39.063 --> 01:24:41.886
Let's hope so, Atreyu.

01:24:41.896 --> 01:24:44.266
Let's hope so.

01:24:48.438 --> 01:24:50.345
Let the AURYN guide you.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:56.306
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

01:25:11.563 --> 01:25:13.056
Falkor!

01:25:16.021 --> 01:25:18.059
The Ivory Tower!

01:26:26.313 --> 01:26:27.806
The Empress.

01:27:37.063 --> 01:27:38.686
Atreyu.

01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:42.938
Why do you look so sad?

01:27:59.896 --> 01:28:01.638
I failed you, Empress.

01:28:04.188 --> 01:28:07.803
No, you haven't.

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.935
You brought him with you.

01:28:12.646 --> 01:28:14.178
Who?

01:28:14.188 --> 01:28:16.970
The earthling child.

01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:22.303
The one who can save us all.

01:28:22.313 --> 01:28:24.268
You knew about the earthling child?

01:28:25.563 --> 01:28:30.261
Of course. I knew everything.

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:34.345
My horse died. I nearly drown.

01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:36.928
I just barely got away
from the Nothing!

01:28:36.938 --> 01:28:39.886
For what? To find out
what you already knew?!

01:28:39.896 --> 01:28:43.470
It was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.015
But I DIDN'T get in touch
with an earthling!

01:28:47.563 --> 01:28:49.305
Yes, you did.

01:28:50.688 --> 01:28:53.011
He has suffered with you.

01:28:53.021 --> 01:28:56.138
He went through
everything you went through.

01:28:57.271 --> 01:29:02.553
And now he has come here with you.

01:29:02.563 --> 01:29:06.095
He is very close,

01:29:06.105 --> 01:29:12.386
listening to every word we say.

01:29:12.396 --> 01:29:13.563
WHAT?!

01:29:28.646 --> 01:29:30.303
Where is he?

01:29:30.313 --> 01:29:32.766
If he's so close,
why doesn't he arrive?

01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:42.802
He doesn't realise he's already
a part of the Neverending Story.

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.886
The Neverending Story? What's that?

01:29:47.896 --> 01:29:51.886
Just as he is sharing
all your adventures,

01:29:51.896 --> 01:29:54.261
others are sharing his.

01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:59.557
They were with him when he hid
from the boys in the bookstore.

01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:04.095
But that's impossible!

01:30:04.105 --> 01:30:07.178
They were with him
when he took the book

01:30:07.188 --> 01:30:09.345
with the AURYN symbol on the cover,

01:30:09.355 --> 01:30:15.932
in which he's reading
his own story right now.

01:30:21.146 --> 01:30:22.971
I can't believe it!

01:30:24.521 --> 01:30:26.975
They can't be talking about me.

01:30:35.021 --> 01:30:38.655
What will happen
if he doesn't appear?

01:30:39.355 --> 01:30:41.096
Then our world will disappear.

01:30:42.688 --> 01:30:44.394
And so will I.

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:50.470
How can he let that happen?!

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.053
He doesn't understand
that he's the one

01:30:53.063 --> 01:30:55.636
who has the power to stop it.

01:30:55.646 --> 01:30:57.470
He simply can't imagine

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.727
that one Little boy
could be that important.

01:31:03.646 --> 01:31:05.269
Is it really me?

01:31:07.371 --> 01:31:09.371
How could I make any difference?

01:31:10.396 --> 01:31:14.178
Maybe he doesn't know what to do!
What do I have to do?

01:31:14.188 --> 01:31:17.605
He has to give me a new name.

01:31:18.685 --> 01:31:22.175
What if he doesn't come up
with the right name?

01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:24.841
He's already chosen it.

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:26.934
He just has to call it out.

01:31:28.685 --> 01:31:33.085
Where is he?
Why isn't here?

01:31:33.205 --> 01:31:35.405
He still doesn't have confidence

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:38.970
But it's only a story.
It's not real!

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.556
It's only a story!

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:45.346
Atreyu, no!
Atreyu!

01:32:13.685 --> 01:32:18.785
Don't you have the courage to save us?

01:32:28.005 --> 01:32:29.877
Bastian.

01:32:31.235 --> 01:32:33.087
I wish I could!

01:32:35.655 --> 01:32:39.645
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:43.405
But I can't! I have to
keep my feet on the ground!

01:32:44.405 --> 01:32:46.111
Call my name!

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:59.985
Bastian! Please!

01:33:01.696 --> 01:33:04.446
Save us!

01:33:06.446 --> 01:33:08.728
Alright!
I'll do it! I'll save you!

01:33:08.738 --> 01:33:11.446
I will do what I dream!

01:33:21.113 --> 01:33:25.154
Moon Child!

01:33:36.863 --> 01:33:39.353
Why is it so dark?

01:33:39.363 --> 01:33:44.067
EMPRESS: In the beginning,
it is always dark.

01:33:48.405 --> 01:33:50.561
What is that?

01:33:50.571 --> 01:33:52.978
One grain of sand.

01:33:52.988 --> 01:33:57.030
That is all that remains
of my vast empire.

01:34:04.488 --> 01:34:08.353
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

01:34:08.363 --> 01:34:10.270
Yes.

01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:16.436
Then... everything's been in vain.

01:34:16.446 --> 01:34:19.231
No, it hasn't.

01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:23.603
Fantasia can arise in you.

01:34:23.613 --> 01:34:27.478
In YOUR dreams and wishes, Bastian.

01:34:27.488 --> 01:34:30.353
How?

01:34:30.363 --> 01:34:32.768
Open your hand.

01:34:47.655 --> 01:34:50.487
What are you going to wish for?

01:34:51.613 --> 01:34:53.106
I don't know.

01:34:55.155 --> 01:34:59.563
Then there will be
no Fantasia anymore.

01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.188
How many wishes do I get?

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:08.978
As many as you want.

01:35:08.988 --> 01:35:12.520
And the more wishes you make,

01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:16.478
the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

01:35:16.488 --> 01:35:18.228
Really?

01:35:18.238 --> 01:35:20.478
Try it.

01:35:32.821 --> 01:35:36.238
Then my first wish is...

01:35:40.155 --> 01:35:42.690
Yeah!

01:35:44.446 --> 01:35:47.480
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

01:35:58.238 --> 01:36:02.279
Like it?
Falkor, it's wonderful!

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.608
Falkor, it's Like
the Nothing never was!

01:36:29.446 --> 01:36:31.769
Atreyu! Artax!

01:36:45.113 --> 01:36:48.946
What would you
Like to wish for next?

01:37:12.113 --> 01:37:14.061
Yeah!

01:37:14.071 --> 01:37:16.311
Yeah!

01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:20.061
Look, there they are!

01:37:21.196 --> 01:37:24.103
It's a monster!

01:37:24.113 --> 01:37:28.103
Get 'em, Falkor!
Let's see how you Like it, chickens!

01:37:28.113 --> 01:37:31.774
Down here!

01:37:44.071 --> 01:37:46.145
We're gonna get you guys!

01:38:12.405 --> 01:38:14.811
Bastian made many other wishes,

01:38:14.821 --> 01:38:18.603
and had many other
amazing adventures,

01:38:18.613 --> 01:38:22.853
before he finally returned
to the ordinary world.

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:25.861
But that's another story.
