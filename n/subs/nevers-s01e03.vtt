is just vibrations,

12:45.959 --> 12:48.750
You don't have to
give me a status report
every time you see me.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.542

yourself and be entertaining

12:51.625 --> 12:54.208

12:59.667 --> 13:01.959

licking her wounds.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.625
Or punching them.

13:03.709 --> 13:06.000
And Bonfire Annie?

13:06.083 --> 13:09.208
Heard you were trying
to recruit her last night.

13:09.291 --> 13:11.500
-Hello, miss.
-Amalia: Does that bother you?

13:11.583 --> 13:14.875
-Get out.
-Mary: I wish I'd been told.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.792
If I turned a corner
and there she was--

13:16.875 --> 13:19.250
I didn't want to worry you
for nothing.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.834
And nothing is what

13:28.875 --> 13:30.792

That's a dodge.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.125
Was there a question?

13:32.208 --> 13:35.458

what this place is,

13:35.542 --> 13:38.208
and what we're
meant to be doing.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.083

different answers.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.709
I can sense that
there's something--

13:43.792 --> 13:48.166
Some sort of mission beyond
keeping each other safe.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.166

A conspiracy? A cult?

13:53.875 --> 13:56.500
-I'm not asking you
to cut off your toes.
-I'm looking for you.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.417
-I'm right here.
-Are you?

14:04.750 --> 14:08.166

I woke up knowing things

I also drink when I shouldn't,
fight when I needn't,

14:17.709 --> 14:20.417
and fuck men whose names
I do not learn.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.667

14:24.959 --> 14:27.208

14:48.083 --> 14:50.959

more people will come here?

to boot.

-He is boss.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.583

Uh, uh, don't smile.
You have mystique.

personal cause.

-Lavinia, if she
finds out what you...
-Your next candidate.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.000
-We... No, you
are making them do--
-Paying them to do.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.291
-Paying me to do.
-Voice (echoing): Ask him...
ask him for housing...

17:19.375 --> 17:22.208
And housing them.
Quiet, you.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.542

-Hugo, this isn't
a schoolyard prank.

being done here
that are illegal.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.625

Wh-wha-what I did

17:40.542 --> 17:43.125
was not the conduct
of a gentleman, I know.

17:43.208 --> 17:47.208
But w-- We didn't--
We didn't break any laws.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.583
-That I know of.
-What you did,
they don't have laws for.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.625
Then I didn't break any.

17:53.542 --> 17:56.083

I-- Of course, I will.
I'll-I'll set you free.
Just give me time.

And, and meanwhile,
enjoy being in charge for a bit,

18:15.875 --> 18:18.709

-No-- In charge?

18:18.792 --> 18:21.125
Well, you don't have to
audition anyone. Just...

18:21.208 --> 18:24.166
look important.
Say no a lot. Roma!

18:25.208 --> 18:27.166
Where the hell
is my purple light?

18:27.250 --> 18:29.125

organized laziness,

18:50.750 --> 18:51.959

18:52.041 --> 18:54.709
Should be grateful for a wage

other people out,

19:03.792 --> 19:05.750

to let them all in.

from the butchers and such.

Of course, sir.

25:52.834 --> 25:56.208
-Dr. Cousens. What a treat.
-I'm sorry. Have we met?

25:56.291 --> 25:58.125
Oh, yes. As it happens,
I promised you

25:58.208 --> 25:59.500
your own carriage.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.625
And at last, it's here.

26:02.709 --> 26:05.500
Huh. I never thought
you meant it.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.625
Ah, I never lie.
I never boast.
(chuckles)

26:08.709 --> 26:13.166
As it happens, a wealthy patient
is waiting for you within.

26:15.917 --> 26:19.750
A new client, of whom
you're not remotely afraid.

26:19.834 --> 26:22.834
Hush, Colonel.
Don't take away his fear.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.083
He might need it.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.125
-(door closes)
-(latch clicks)

26:33.041 --> 26:34.542
Are you afraid?

26:34.625 --> 26:36.375
It's well known
how you pay your doctors.

26:36.458 --> 26:40.208
They were compensated in kind
for the services they provided.

26:40.291 --> 26:42.750
You don't mess about
with brains,
you're all right.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.250
You know who I work with?

26:44.333 --> 26:45.959
Everyone knows the Beggar King

26:46.041 --> 26:49.000
has a doctor on call
with healing hands.

26:50.750 --> 26:53.166
Yes, I know. Mrs. True.

26:53.250 --> 26:56.125
But this ain't about her.
It's about the gift she gave me.

26:56.208 --> 26:59.458
And if I heal you,
how do I know you won't--

26:59.542 --> 27:02.333
What, strike you down
to get at Molly?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.375
If you're frettin' on that,

27:05.458 --> 27:09.667
you two must be...
dear friends.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.792
Oh, you do go back a ways.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.709
We all do.

27:14.709 --> 27:17.125
Except I don't
remember you so well.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.667
Although there was a Black
in a doctor's coat,

27:19.750 --> 27:21.667
which I thought
my mind made up.

27:22.458 --> 27:23.667
No...

27:24.959 --> 27:26.417
I'm real.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.166
Do you want to
show me the wound?

27:32.083 --> 27:36.166
Yes, sir, doctor, sir.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.625
Whew.
(inhales sharply)

27:38.709 --> 27:41.250
It's a persistent
little pinhole.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.417
Kiss it better.

28:02.583 --> 28:07.083
Hmm. Still a bullet
fragment in there.

28:07.166 --> 28:11.125
I'll have to take it out
before I can help you.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.208
This is going to hurt.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.250

28:32.792 --> 28:34.041
Man gave me this.

28:34.125 --> 28:37.375
I was told to wait
two hours. Sorry.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.625
And another whiskey.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.542
Frank:
Swann.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.625
-Not bad on the eyes.
-Yeah, all right, though.

28:45.709 --> 28:48.208

A bunch of girls longing
to leave the safety

30:41.083 --> 30:44.125
-to come whoring for you?
-Uh, a few.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.458
You do have a talent for it.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.083
What about Mary Brighton?

30:49.166 --> 30:51.333
Her "turn," I mean.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.500
I told you. It's a song.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.291
Only the Touched can hear it.

It makes 'em feel happy.

Amalia True risks
life and limb for a lullaby.

-No, there's more.
-Mary don't know anything
about Mrs. True's plans.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.709
Mary left you on
your wedding day.

31:07.792 --> 31:11.125
I think it's safe to say
she does keep things from you.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.083
She did you a favor, of course.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.250
(grunts)

31:20.333 --> 31:23.166
Such a dramatic disappointment.

No one would question you
not rushing to the altar

31:25.417 --> 31:26.750
-a second time.
-(liquid pouring)

31:26.834 --> 31:28.542
I often wonder,

31:28.625 --> 31:32.542
did she realize she could never
give you what you wanted,

31:32.625 --> 31:34.542
or did she find out I was?

31:34.625 --> 31:36.625
I was drunk!

But it depends on an
immeasurable level of change.

Amalia True?

I do not believe
she has any interest

31:55.291 --> 31:58.000

a safe haven. Do you?

It's been a long while
since I've seen you on a stage.

40:14.917 --> 40:17.417
Arrangements have
already been made,
and we, uh--

40:17.500 --> 40:19.750
-Forgive us, we have to begin.
-Of course, of course.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.750
I got the gist
on my telephone.

40:21.834 --> 40:25.333
What are the confidence levels
on the investment's return?

40:25.417 --> 40:29.750
Regrettably, we are among those
who cannot see into the future.

40:29.834 --> 40:32.583
But we do have a clearer
view of the field.

40:32.667 --> 40:35.625
It appears the new players
are in motion.

40:39.208 --> 40:41.083
We need to get
those fliers taken down.

40:41.166 --> 40:42.875
-They could be all over London.
-Leave them.

40:42.959 --> 40:45.583
I'll have someone
watch the house
in case anyone turns up,

40:45.667 --> 40:47.250
innocent or otherwise.

40:47.333 --> 40:50.542
-What can I do?
-I need to know
who owns the building.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.792
I can get that information
for you in a day or so.

40:52.875 --> 40:54.959
Although I doubt
it will reveal much.

40:55.041 --> 40:56.792
What about Mary Brighton?

40:56.875 --> 41:00.458
Is she doing her siren call,
or what have you?

41:00.542 --> 41:02.959
Amalia:
I'm not sure.
She's been struggling.

41:03.041 --> 41:06.583
We're doing the test
this evening, in the park.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.875
If Mary can find her voice,
we'll make sure it's heard.

41:11.417 --> 41:13.542
Distorted voice:
What did you tell them?

41:14.875 --> 41:16.375
What...

41:18.375 --> 41:21.375
What? What--

41:21.458 --> 41:23.750
N-nothing. I-I never said--

41:23.834 --> 41:26.125
-What did you tell them?!
-I, I, I, s-swear.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.291
I, I didn't tell
anyone anything.

41:28.375 --> 41:29.667
I didn't!

41:29.750 --> 41:32.291

Well, now that your blood is up,

41:32.375 --> 41:35.709

who answer your flier.

41:46.458 --> 41:48.542
Well, I'm not answering
any of your questions.

41:48.625 --> 41:50.375
Who do you work for?

41:50.458 --> 41:53.125
A man. Tall. Had a fur coat.

41:53.208 --> 41:55.500
Well-spoken but not too posh.

41:55.583 --> 41:58.583
You think they'd send
the boss around,
showin' his face?

41:58.667 --> 42:00.500
What do they do to the girls?

42:00.583 --> 42:02.208
Experiments, I think.

42:04.709 --> 42:08.291
-Why you?
-They knowed about
my tragedy, I guess.

42:08.375 --> 42:10.458
About my daughter,
and all the suffering.

42:10.542 --> 42:11.709
Did you hear a name?

42:11.792 --> 42:14.041
Water. She made
everything water.

42:14.125 --> 42:17.083
Any liquid.
She did it with wine,

42:17.166 --> 42:19.625
which is the opposite
of Jesus. (laughs)

42:19.709 --> 42:21.583
Plus, it cost me two shillings.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.709
There was a well,
made everyone sick.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.500
She fixed that,

42:26.583 --> 42:29.291
but that's not for
a person to do.

42:29.375 --> 42:30.875
But she was never afraid of it.

42:30.959 --> 42:32.208
She stopped being
afraid of anything.

42:32.291 --> 42:35.041
She would just say,
"Water is life."

42:35.125 --> 42:38.291
Sitting up nights
with her needlework,

42:38.375 --> 42:40.500
just knowing something.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.291
Sitting and knowing.

42:43.375 --> 42:46.083
A young man saw it, too.
It was unnatural.

42:47.083 --> 42:50.250
My heart bleeding for the burden

42:50.333 --> 42:53.000
on, uh, on, on me.

42:54.333 --> 42:57.250
And she went for a bath.

42:57.333 --> 43:01.333
And it was so hot.
It was so hard to...

43:01.417 --> 43:06.709
hold her down like that
'cause she didn't understand.

43:06.792 --> 43:11.125
She was splashing and struggling

43:11.208 --> 43:12.917
and trying to cry out.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.500
I could see it all 'cause
she made the water so clear.

43:16.583 --> 43:18.083
(exhales sharply)

43:18.166 --> 43:20.792
I had to bear that.

43:20.875 --> 43:23.291

43:23.375 --> 43:24.875

43:57.125 --> 43:58.667

she was Touched

43:58.750 --> 44:01.959

up from his bassinet.

44:02.041 --> 44:05.583
Six months old
and the first person
to ever love her back.

44:08.125 --> 44:11.375

before he could even
make a sound.

in front of seven people.

we're with Amalia, and she falls
out of the door, into a lake.

58:11.917 --> 58:15.291

who's played by Martyn Ford,

58:15.375 --> 58:17.166

350 pounds. The guy's huge.

for the Beggar King.

"You cannot get
that man in a bath."

58:36.500 --> 58:39.875
And it isn't until episode three
that you learns what he means.

58:39.959 --> 58:42.750
That he literally
can't get into water.

58:43.083 --> 58:44.709
The writing staff observed that,

58:44.792 --> 58:48.250
"Wow. If he got in a fight
with someone on water,

58:48.667 --> 58:51.834
he could just whack-a-mole them.
He could just stomp them down

is that Amalia
can't come up above water,

59:04.834 --> 59:07.125

beaten by Odium.

59:29.792 --> 59:31.875
JOHNNY HAN: From
the moment we got the scripts,

59:31.959 --> 59:32.959
we were kind of excited

59:33.041 --> 59:34.750
it was in episode three
and not one,

59:34.834 --> 59:37.083
because it gave us a little bit
of time to figure it out.

59:37.667 --> 59:39.917
You know, at first, we were
stressing out, 'cause it's like,

59:40.000 --> 59:44.041
"Oh, gosh. This is so like...
This is difficult."

59:46.667 --> 59:50.542
We didn't want Odium basically
to try to just drown Amalia.

59:51.917 --> 59:54.125
Amalia's a fighter
and she's smart.

59:54.208 --> 59:56.834
And she's gonna figure
her way out of things.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.875
IRLAM: We're always
looking to find the moments

1:00:02.959 --> 1:00:04.959
that make people go,
"Wow, that's cool."

1:00:05.542 --> 1:00:06.917
Whether it's within a fight,

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.583
or whether it's
within a carriage chase,

1:00:08.667 --> 1:00:10.542
or whether it's
within a water sequence.

1:00:10.625 --> 1:00:13.208
We're always trying to find
something that the audience

1:00:13.291 --> 1:00:14.709
hopefully hasn't seen before.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:19.041
HAN: Our stunts team,
led by Rowley,

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:23.166
choreographed this
amazing sequence,

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:28.542
that was full of wirework
and incredible stunts.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:33.709
Amalia climbing on top of Odium,
and toppling him like a tree.

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:38.834
And... visual effects
is figuring out,

1:00:38.917 --> 1:00:40.959
"All right, how are we
even gonna film this?

1:00:41.417 --> 1:00:43.917
Can we shoot it in the lake?"
We decide no.

1:00:44.917 --> 1:00:46.667
'Cause it turns out
it's gonna be February,

1:00:46.750 --> 1:00:48.041
and it's gonna be frozen.

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:50.917
IRLAM: Rolling, rolling. Hold
your breath underwater, please.

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.333
HAN: We decided on a tank that's
specially designed for filming,

1:00:54.417 --> 1:00:58.417
and to wrap the whole tank
in green screen on all sides...

1:00:58.500 --> 1:01:01.125
IRLAM: And three, two, one...
(YELLS)

1:01:01.208 --> 1:01:04.542
HAN: ...so that we could use
the green screen water tank,

1:01:04.625 --> 1:01:08.291
and put our footage of the lake
beyond the tank.

1:01:08.583 --> 1:01:09.500
IRLAM: Action!

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:10.792
(YELLS)

1:01:11.709 --> 1:01:15.625
We had to... put a deck
in that was literally five mil

1:01:15.709 --> 1:01:16.917
beneath the surface to make it

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.583
look like Martyn Ford's
walking on water.

1:01:19.917 --> 1:01:22.667
In addition, we put him
in a harness and we flew him.

1:01:22.750 --> 1:01:24.792
And so,
he faked walking on water.

1:01:24.875 --> 1:01:27.792
It was a massive deal
to try and make this work.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:33.166
HAN: With Odium, we didn't just
want the feeling of someone

1:01:33.250 --> 1:01:36.417
walking on a solid platform.

1:01:36.625 --> 1:01:38.208
We feel kinda,
has been done.

1:01:39.333 --> 1:01:44.542
His power is that
he can affect water
with this field around him.

1:01:44.959 --> 1:01:47.291
It's not like he's got
feet that float,

1:01:47.542 --> 1:01:50.583
it's simply that the water,
when it comes near him,

1:01:50.834 --> 1:01:52.083
behaves differently.

1:01:53.709 --> 1:01:55.166
We looked at references

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:58.959
of insects that are light enough
to crawl on the water.

1:02:00.083 --> 1:02:02.250
We looked at
non-Newtonian fluids,

1:02:02.333 --> 1:02:05.291
where basically, if you run
across it fast enough,

1:02:05.625 --> 1:02:08.792
it stays solid,
but if you stop, you'll sink.

1:02:09.291 --> 1:02:11.750
We actually went
to a trampoline park,

1:02:12.041 --> 1:02:14.709
and I phone-recorded
what we were doing.

1:02:14.792 --> 1:02:16.250
We watch it, we're like,
"Okay, you know,

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:19.875
that's a good example
of when his feet land."

1:02:20.333 --> 1:02:23.333
And you get a sense
of the ground rippling out.

1:02:23.959 --> 1:02:25.542
And we're like,
"Hey, that's pretty cool.

1:02:25.625 --> 1:02:26.834
Let's try to do that."

1:02:28.709 --> 1:02:30.166
(GASPS)

1:02:30.667 --> 1:02:32.041
(GRUNTS)

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:36.458
IRLAM: That's great, Laura.
Well done.

1:02:37.458 --> 1:02:40.000
DONNELLY: It was the most
incredible thing to shoot.

1:02:41.917 --> 1:02:43.250
Rowley is wonderful.

1:02:43.333 --> 1:02:47.000
Rowley allows me to do loads
of stunts, and I like that.

1:02:47.083 --> 1:02:50.917
Uh, he-- yeah, he trusts me
and I trust him implicitly.

1:02:51.333 --> 1:02:53.834
We started training for that,

1:02:53.917 --> 1:02:55.542
by getting me used
to being under the water,

1:02:55.625 --> 1:02:57.125
and using
the breathing apparatus.

1:02:57.375 --> 1:02:58.750
IRLAM:
Laura was amazing, you know.

1:02:58.834 --> 1:03:00.792
We did lots
of scuba training with her,

1:03:00.875 --> 1:03:02.375
so we took her
to the bottom of the tank.

1:03:02.667 --> 1:03:04.792
You know, and we had her
with two scuba divers

1:03:04.875 --> 1:03:06.208
down at, um, 20 feet.

1:03:06.542 --> 1:03:09.750
Then she would literally swim
from one diver to the other.

1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:11.875
DONNELLY: That was
a steep learning curve.

1:03:11.959 --> 1:03:15.417
You know, it was just
a few days of taking big steps.

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.458
Um, but then when it came
to the actual shooting of it,

1:03:18.667 --> 1:03:20.291
I just felt completely
comfortable in it.

1:03:20.375 --> 1:03:22.667
To be honest, I think I was
mostly running on adrenaline

1:03:22.750 --> 1:03:24.917
for a couple of weeks. It was--
It was so much fun. (CHUCKLES)

1:03:25.542 --> 1:03:28.250
IRLAM: Are you ready, guys?
Head in underwater, please.

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:30.208
DONNELLY:
Helen, my stunt double,

1:03:30.291 --> 1:03:35.792
will always do the first take
of any stunt or fight,

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:36.959
or anything like that.

1:03:37.041 --> 1:03:37.875
IRLAM: Good.

1:03:38.375 --> 1:03:39.959
DONNELLY: Just to make sure
that everybody gets an idea

1:03:40.041 --> 1:03:41.250
of how it should be done.

1:03:41.333 --> 1:03:42.792
And that, you know,
there's one take

1:03:42.875 --> 1:03:44.333
that is done incredibly well,

1:03:44.417 --> 1:03:46.750
because she's amazing
at what she does.

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.875
IRLAM: Three, two, one. Action!

1:03:48.959 --> 1:03:49.750
(ODIUM YELLS)

1:03:50.250 --> 1:03:53.875
DONNELLY: And then, I get
to do pretty much everything

1:03:54.250 --> 1:03:55.875
-after that.
-IRLAM: And pull!

1:03:56.083 --> 1:03:56.917
(GROANING)

1:03:57.375 --> 1:04:00.333
DONNELLY: It's wonderful,
because it gives me such

1:04:00.583 --> 1:04:03.125
confidence to know that
they have confidence in me,

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:05.125
to get those shots.

1:04:09.583 --> 1:04:11.417

-(YELLS)

1:04:21.125 --> 1:04:22.125
IRLAM: We've got one shot

1:04:22.417 --> 1:04:24.709
where Martyn's lying
on the water in a harness,

1:04:24.792 --> 1:04:26.792
Laura's underneath him,
upside down.

1:04:26.875 --> 1:04:29.959
And an awful lot of people
cannot hang upside down in water

1:04:30.041 --> 1:04:31.458
without water
going up their nose.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.834
You know, and it's a-- it's
an iconic moment in our show.

1:04:35.583 --> 1:04:37.834
DONNELLY: You know, when
upside down in the water...

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:40.750
with no-- like with, you know,
your nose filling with water--

1:04:40.834 --> 1:04:43.834
your head filling with water,
and trying to hold your breath,

1:04:44.041 --> 1:04:47.208
while you're, you know, holding
a chain around somebody's neck

1:04:47.291 --> 1:04:50.000
just long enough
that they pass out, is a--

1:04:50.083 --> 1:04:52.500
it's a challenge.
But, um...

1:04:52.583 --> 1:04:54.083
It was-- It's one
of my favorite things

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:55.041
that I've ever filmed.

1:04:55.417 --> 1:04:57.959
IRLAM: ...fourteen, and fifteen.
Laura, swim away.

1:04:58.458 --> 1:04:59.375
(GASPS)

1:05:00.458 --> 1:05:02.166
DONNELLY: I just am constantly
looking forward to what

1:05:02.250 --> 1:05:04.875
they've got lined up
for me next. (CHUCKLES)
