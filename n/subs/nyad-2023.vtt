<i>Twenty-eight year-old Diana Nyad,</i>

[Carson] 89 miles, a long distance swim
from the Bahamas to Florida,

01:21.291 --> 01:25.291
took 27 hours and 38 minutes
to complete the swim,

01:25.291 --> 01:27.583
and that is a new open ocean record.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.208
Would you welcome Diana Nyad.

01:40.916 --> 01:41.833
Congratulations.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.750
Are you getting tired
of being congratulated on that remarkable,

01:44.750 --> 01:46.291
and it was a remarkable achievement?

01:46.291 --> 01:48.500
No, I'm not getting tired.
It was worth it.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.375
- [Carson] Yeah--
- Glad to meet you, by the way.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.500
I was wondering how many times
I'd have to do your show before I met you.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.041
[audience laughing, cheering, applauding]

01:57.375 --> 02:00.500
[Diana] The swim I wanna do is 60 hours,
two and a half days.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.833
That's Cuba to Florida.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.583
- And it's outrageous, and it's...
- [Carson] Two and a half days?

02:04.583 --> 02:07.083
[Diana] ...it's overly ambitious,
but I think I can make it.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.583
And that's my last swim.

02:09.291 --> 02:11.916
<i>Sixty hours nonstop
in the open sea.</i>

02:11.916 --> 02:14.500
<i>It's like winning that gold medal

02:14.500 --> 02:17.291
<i>The way I look at it,
the Bahamas is the appetizer,</i>

02:17.291 --> 02:19.791
<i>Cuba is the main course,
and retirement's the dessert.</i>

02:20.625 --> 02:22.333
<i>The Cuba swim is rough.</i>

02:22.333 --> 02:26.041

at this point if it can be done.</i>

02:32.375 --> 02:33.416
<i>But from the beginning,</i>

02:33.416 --> 02:36.500
<i>she knew her chances of finishing
were only 50-50.</i>

02:36.500 --> 02:39.458

[plane engine whirring]

02:55.750 --> 02:58.333
- [Diana] The entire world is asleep.
- [woman] Yeah.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.375
[Diana] And even when awake,
they're barely there.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.375
- [woman] I know.
- [Diana] Laziness is contagious,

03:02.375 --> 03:04.750
and we're supposed to just nod along

03:04.750 --> 03:08.166
like it's normal that everyone's
just surrendered to a banal existence.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.291
Is this about 60?

03:09.791 --> 03:10.708
- What?
- 60?

03:10.708 --> 03:11.666
- No.
- Okay.

03:11.666 --> 03:15.083
By the way, for tomorrow,
I don't want anything, okay? No cake.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.875
Not even a little grocery store cake.

03:16.875 --> 03:20.125
For someone who doesn't wanna celebrate
their birthday, you mention it frequently.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.291
Yes.

03:21.291 --> 03:25.041
Just quiet, okay? Just us. Maybe Scrabble.

03:25.833 --> 03:26.666
Good.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.291
I didn't plan anything
'cause you told me not to, like, 37 times.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.833
[Diana] Yes. We're not doing that.

03:31.333 --> 03:32.416
Ugh!

03:33.291 --> 03:34.625
I forgot the poop bags.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.541
[Diana] Bonnie, that was the whole reason
you went to Petco.

03:37.541 --> 03:40.125
I know. But come on,
we're gonna get some steps in.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.750
- Come on. One, two, three. You can do it.
- [Diana sighing]

03:46.291 --> 03:48.291
[Diana] Teddy, hi.

03:48.791 --> 03:50.208
Hi.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.958
Can you sit? Can you sit?

03:52.791 --> 03:55.958
Good boy. Good boy.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.041
What a good boy.

03:59.291 --> 04:00.333
Okay. [sighing]

04:12.625 --> 04:14.666
[knocking on door]

04:15.583 --> 04:18.708
- Yeah, the door's locked.
- Well, happy freaking birthday to you.

04:18.708 --> 04:21.333
Yeah, I brought my Scrabble
'cause, though you won't admit it,

04:21.333 --> 04:23.791
you're missing a G,
two Es, and at least one blank tile.

04:23.791 --> 04:26.041
- Hey, hey, uh, come here.
- What are we having for dinner?

04:26.041 --> 04:29.333
- I wanna show you something over here.
- What? Why are you talking like that?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.708
Like what?

04:30.708 --> 04:32.291
Like you're enunciating.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.208
Did you blow-dry your hair?

04:34.208 --> 04:38.041
- [all] Surprise, Diana!
- [Diana squealing]

04:38.041 --> 04:40.708
- What?
- [crowd cheering, applauding]

04:40.708 --> 04:41.875
[Diana exclaiming]

04:42.375 --> 04:44.250
Bonnie, I said no party.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.583
Well, you didn't mean it.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.500
[Diana chuckling]

04:47.500 --> 04:49.125
- [Bonnie] You happy?
- I am.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.291
- [Bonnie] Blow it out.
- [Diana] Okay.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.875
- No, wait. I gotta think of a wish.
- [man] Make it a good one!

04:53.875 --> 04:54.833
[man 2] Make a wish!

04:54.833 --> 04:56.250
[upbeat music playing]

04:56.250 --> 04:57.375
I wish...

04:57.375 --> 04:58.708
I was five years old,

04:58.708 --> 05:02.333
and my father drops
the Webster's Dictionary in my lap.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.833
[in accent] "Darling,
I am waiting five years

05:05.833 --> 05:07.958
'till you are ready to show you

05:07.958 --> 05:09.833
your name in black-and-white."

05:09.833 --> 05:12.666
"Your name says, in Greek mythology,

05:12.666 --> 05:14.500
my ancestors,

05:14.500 --> 05:18.666
the nymphs that swam in the lakes
and the rivers and the ocean."

05:18.666 --> 05:20.541
- [whispering] Okay.
-"This is your destiny."

05:20.541 --> 05:22.833
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna steal her away now. Come on.

05:22.833 --> 05:26.083
- No, I was just getting to the good part.
- Have you heard the expression--

05:26.083 --> 05:29.000
I'm sure you have. The one that goes,
uh, "Leave them wanting more?"

05:29.000 --> 05:31.583
- I just... I never found it applies to me.
- [Bonnie chuckling]

05:31.583 --> 05:33.000
- [Bonnie] Come here.
- [Diana] What?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.500
- There's Nina. She'd still--
- I know. Look over there.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.250
She's got, um, white pants and she's tall.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.375
- [pop music playing over radio]
- [Diana] Oh.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.041
- [Diana] Oh God.
- What?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.500
- I don't know.
- What's the problem?

05:44.291 --> 05:46.000
I don't know, she seems a little...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.708
Nice? Seems normal? Not psycho?

05:49.208 --> 05:50.625
[indistinct chatter]

05:50.625 --> 05:52.250
Does she know a lot about me?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.791
She's got your poster on her wall

05:53.791 --> 05:56.416
and she's got your face tattooed
on her ass.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.333
Yes.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.916
- That's not funny.
- Let's just go talk to her.

05:59.916 --> 06:02.083
You're gonna...
you're gonna ask all about herself,

06:02.083 --> 06:05.083
and, um,
you're not gonna talk about yourself.

06:05.083 --> 06:07.833
I've been to Vietnam, Uganda,

06:08.333 --> 06:10.791
caves of Belize, Sydney.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.625
I covered the Olympics there.

06:12.625 --> 06:16.250
Thirty years with ABC Sports
has taken me all over the world.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.708
But my favorite place, Cuba.

06:20.541 --> 06:23.708
I'm sure you could've guessed.
I mean, I imagine you know that...

06:24.541 --> 06:25.875
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- [Diana] Yeah.

06:25.875 --> 06:29.875
Cuba, it's just loomed
in my imagination since I was a kid.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.000
The magical place across the water.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.208
Forbidden land.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.000
[chuckling] We weren't allowed there,
they weren't allowed here.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.250
Wow, that's amazing.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.541
So, how do you know Bonnie?

06:44.541 --> 06:47.125
I thought maybe you and her were...

06:48.083 --> 06:49.958
Oh no, no, no, we're best friends.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.833
I mean, we dated for, like, a second
200 years ago, but...

06:53.333 --> 06:54.750
[breathing deeply, exhaling]

06:54.750 --> 06:56.833
So, tell me something about you.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.416
Just because we're on a one-way street
hurtling towards death

07:00.416 --> 07:03.583
doesn't mean
that we have to succumb to mediocrity.

07:03.583 --> 07:08.041
I mean, you turn 60 and the world decides
that you're a bag of bones.

07:08.791 --> 07:10.333
I'm 58, so I wouldn't know.

07:11.625 --> 07:12.750
[dog barking]

07:12.750 --> 07:16.000
Seemed like it was going pretty well
with, uh, you know, what's her name.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.583
Oh yeah, it was great. She was great.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.833
It was great. No, it's not that.

07:21.833 --> 07:25.666
It's, I don't know, dating.
I don't think I need that anymore.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.958
I hear you. Me neither.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.541
So, what's the funk? Is it work?

07:33.166 --> 07:34.416
It's everything.

07:34.916 --> 07:36.666
Okay? Where's the excellence?

07:36.666 --> 07:37.916
Oh God.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.500
- I'm serious.
- [Bonnie] Ugh, that again.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.958
I mean,
I don't think I can take it anymore.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.125
[utensils clattering]

07:44.041 --> 07:46.875
Well, if you feel that way,
then do something about it.

07:47.666 --> 07:49.666
[objects clattering]

07:51.000 --> 07:52.291
Wanna play Scrabble?

07:52.833 --> 07:55.125
[Bonnie] I still got these dishes.
I got stuff to do.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.541
Oh, so you're scared to lose.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.666
Yeah, noted.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.708
I'm gonna whoop your butt.

08:00.708 --> 08:01.875
[Diana chuckling]

08:01.875 --> 08:03.583
You're going down, missy.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.958
Bag of bones or not,
I do not discriminate.

08:06.875 --> 08:07.958
- Bon?
- [Bonnie] Hmm?

08:07.958 --> 08:09.541
It was a really good party.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.416
No biggie. Come on.

08:11.416 --> 08:12.666
[dramatic music playing]

08:12.666 --> 08:15.333
Prepare to lose. Prepare to die!

08:15.333 --> 08:17.000
[crowd cheering on TV]

08:17.000 --> 08:20.458
[reporter] <i>Carrie, definitely one
of the more interesting performers</i>

08:20.458 --> 08:22.208
<i>and one of the more entertaining...</i>

08:22.208 --> 08:23.500
[Diana breathing heavily]

08:25.666 --> 08:26.916
[Diana exhaling sharply]

08:29.166 --> 08:30.250

[Diana exhaling]

08:41.291 --> 08:42.416
[Diana grunting]

08:51.291 --> 08:53.500
[Diana] I finally went
through my mom's old boxes,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.750
you know, stuff from the nursing home.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.125
Listen to this.

08:57.916 --> 09:03.416
"Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?"

09:03.958 --> 09:05.041
[Bonnie] Mary Oliver.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.083
You know Mary Oliver?

09:08.083 --> 09:09.375
Pretty famous line.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.833
See, I just don't go in for poetry.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.291
- It's 'cause you're too impatient.
- Why not just say what they mean?

09:16.291 --> 09:18.041
I mean, I gotta put all this stuff away.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.416
This is ridiculous.
You don't put anything away.

09:20.416 --> 09:21.625
And... and look at this.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.500
You gonna keep all these, uh, <i>New Yorkers</i>?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.250
I mean, look, 2006. Like a hoarder.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.791
So I'm thinking, did Lucy read this poem?

09:30.791 --> 09:33.000
Did she dog-ear this page?

09:33.541 --> 09:37.291
But it's weird, right?
Because in her life, she didn't do shit.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.500
- Your dead mother?
- You know what I mean.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.333
She wasn't a doer, she was a pushover,

09:41.333 --> 09:44.541
totally bulldozed by my dad
till he left us.

09:44.541 --> 09:48.416
So, I'm thinking this poem
must have meant something to her.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.833
She held onto this book.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.458
What was she feeling about her own life

09:52.458 --> 09:54.958
and did she leave it for me
as, like, a message?

09:54.958 --> 09:57.291
- A message.
- And then I realize, look.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.041
It wasn't even hers.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.291
Belongs to some guy
named Uli next door who's 102.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.083
Well, maybe...
maybe Uli's leaving you a message.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.416
[dramatic music playing]

10:14.625 --> 10:16.958
[Diana] "<i>What else should I have done?"</i>

10:16.958 --> 10:20.125

[Diana] When you told me that thing,

22:20.875 --> 22:23.625
what that Steve
and that so-called doctor said

22:23.625 --> 22:25.541
it just made me wanna do it more.

22:25.541 --> 22:26.791
Really?

22:27.750 --> 22:29.583
- Oh my God!
- No.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.416
- You sneaky little--
- [Bonnie chuckling]

22:31.416 --> 22:33.625
Now, that's why you're gonna be
a terrific coach.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.750
I don't know the first thing
about training a swimmer.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.916
You don't need to. You'll learn.

22:37.916 --> 22:38.833
I don't know.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.458
The whole... the whole Cuba thing,

22:41.458 --> 22:44.250
with the visas
and the logistics and the money.

22:44.250 --> 22:46.500
I mean, it... it...
uh, there's sharks out there.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.875
- I'll handle all of it.
- [Bonnie laughing]

22:48.875 --> 22:50.083
What about my clients?

22:50.083 --> 22:52.583
- Oh, I don't know.
- [Bonnie] What about them?

22:52.583 --> 22:53.625
They'll survive!

22:53.625 --> 22:55.791
Oh... You just gonna quit
your sportscasting job?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.708
Yes!

22:56.708 --> 22:59.583
Come on! No more sitting on the sidelines.
I've had it.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.041
Listen, Bonnie,
I just know I can do it, okay?

23:02.041 --> 23:03.500
And I wanna do it with you.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.291
I gotta do it with you.
I couldn't do it without you.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.166
All right. Okay, I'm in.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.666

I... I just need an answer from you.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.541
Did you contact that guy
about the steel cage?

24:55.541 --> 24:57.125
Oh. Oh yeah.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.250
No, I'm not doing that again.

24:59.750 --> 25:00.916
Excuse me?

25:00.916 --> 25:04.291
Well, a shark cage makes it an aided swim.

25:04.291 --> 25:05.375
No, thanks.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.083
It's just me and the ocean the whole way.

25:08.083 --> 25:09.875
Well, when were you gonna tell me that?

25:09.875 --> 25:13.625
Yeah, I don't want an asterisk
next to my life's greatest achievement.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.750
- But you know it's never been done before.
- Exactly.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.458
I'll be the first.

25:20.041 --> 25:22.250
I'm the swimmer, Bon. It's my call.

- Bonnie.

- Hello, I'm Diana.
- She's dying to meet you.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.958
- Here, I take.
- Oh, that's okay, I got it, I got it.

25:38.958 --> 25:41.041
You know, I haven't seen Nina in years,

25:41.041 --> 25:43.083

she and my mom still talk every week,

25:43.083 --> 25:44.291

- [woman] Mm-hmm.
- We're so grateful.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.000
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

- Our home is yours.
- Our pleasure.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.166
[in French] Isn't it, Mia?

25:51.166 --> 25:54.333
The English Channel,
for example, is 21 miles.

25:54.333 --> 25:57.583
I could swim that
in seven and a half hours,

25:57.583 --> 25:58.958
even in the cold.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.208
Cuba is on another level.

26:00.208 --> 26:04.833
It's 100 miles, or 60 hours,

26:04.833 --> 26:06.541
of constant swimming.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.666
Now, I can stop to get medical attention,

26:09.666 --> 26:12.250
I receive nourishment from my handlers,

26:12.250 --> 26:17.833
or just float and marvel
at the dazzling universe above.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.083
It's just so cool.

26:20.583 --> 26:23.416
I'm this tiny speck

26:23.916 --> 26:26.250
floating under the stars,

26:26.750 --> 26:30.291
but I can't stop or touch the boat,

26:30.291 --> 26:32.041
even to poop or pee.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.833
- Do you poop in the water?
- [kids giggling]

26:34.833 --> 26:37.041
- Yes. I'll get back to that.
- [boy] Eww.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.291
[kids giggling]

26:38.291 --> 26:40.416
[Diana] But first,
I should tell you about the cold,

26:40.416 --> 26:43.375
the risk for hypothermia,
but that's not what I'm most afraid of.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.500
What are you most afraid of?

26:46.500 --> 26:47.833
Sea creatures.

26:47.833 --> 26:49.166
In these very waters,

26:49.166 --> 26:52.208
live some of the deadliest
marine animals on Earth.

26:52.208 --> 26:55.083
Forty-nine varieties of sharks,

26:55.083 --> 26:57.041
stingrays, man of war.

26:57.041 --> 26:59.875
And at night,
you don't even know they're there.

26:59.875 --> 27:03.625
It's so dark you can barely see
a few inches in front of your face,

27:03.625 --> 27:06.250
and they're right out there
just waiting for us.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.333
Yes?

27:07.333 --> 27:09.458
Here I am, 30 years later,

27:09.458 --> 27:13.041
and I would love to see Pizza Hut
emblazoned on my swimsuit

27:13.041 --> 27:14.750
as I traverse these--

27:14.750 --> 27:17.625
Yes. Your math is correct, I am 61,

27:17.625 --> 27:20.041
but that's the reason <i>to</i> do it,
not the other--

27:21.791 --> 27:24.291
Well, of course you're entitled
to your opinion,

27:25.083 --> 27:29.708
but I can't begin to tell you how
incredibly wrong and shortsighted it is.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.708
First time,
it was like taking candy from a baby.

27:33.708 --> 27:38.000
I just... I strutted into Rocky Aoki's
office, the Benihana guy,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.541
and I heard he was into ocean stuff,
so I just showed up,

27:41.541 --> 27:46.833
and I walked out with this huge,
like, lottery-sized check for $300,000.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.875
- You realize I've heard this story?
- [Diana] Yeah.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.250
- Right, like, 400 times.
- [Diana] It's a good story.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.333
Yeah, but now it's like
a giant-sized lottery check.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.958
Think he wants to invest again?

27:56.958 --> 27:58.541
Actually, he's dead.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.416
Oh.

28:00.416 --> 28:03.000
Also, we need $500,000 this time.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.583
[Bonnie] Well,
maybe we need, like, a new angle.

28:08.583 --> 28:11.708
Less men in suits and more lady stuff.

28:11.708 --> 28:14.250
- What do you mean, like tampons?
- [Bonnie chuckling]

28:14.250 --> 28:16.208
Not that we need those anymore, thank God.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.375
No, thank God.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.708
Also, Bon,

28:18.708 --> 28:21.500
not that I'm worried
because I'm... I'm not, but

28:23.083 --> 28:25.041
what are we gonna do about the sharks?

28:25.666 --> 28:28.083
- Sharks don't hunt people. Okay?
- [rock music playing on radio]

28:28.083 --> 28:30.166
They don't wanna eat humans,
they wanna eat seals.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.750
Yeah, but--

28:31.750 --> 28:35.125
Sometimes, they'll test
whether you are in fact a seal.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.541
How exactly do they test you? I mean...

28:37.541 --> 28:39.166
That's why we have the shield.

28:40.166 --> 28:43.958
Two electrodes
attached to the back of each kayak

28:43.958 --> 28:45.875
that transmit an amplified signal.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.708
They hate it. You watch.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.333
[Bonnie] Oh!

28:53.791 --> 28:54.708
Oh!

28:54.708 --> 28:56.833
Is... is that really necessary?

28:56.833 --> 28:58.291
Don't worry, we've tested it.

28:58.291 --> 29:01.291
Tried it on a bloody horse's leg
in the South Pacific.

29:01.291 --> 29:04.333
Now, that's a dinner bell for a shark.
They all turned away.

29:04.333 --> 29:07.458
Do you think you can, like,
shine a light on her at night?

29:07.458 --> 29:08.625
'Cause I can't see her,

29:08.625 --> 29:12.041
and the only way I know where she is
is when she's, uh, slapping the water...

29:12.041 --> 29:13.208
- Guys!
- ...with her hands.

29:13.208 --> 29:14.958
- [man] Light attracts bait fish.
- Hello?

29:14.958 --> 29:17.000
- [Diana] Guys!
- [man] Oh, he's coming in. Watch.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.041
[Diana gasping]

29:18.625 --> 29:20.625
[electrodes warbling]

29:20.625 --> 29:24.750
Hey! Tiny sensory organs in the snout.
The electrical current messes them up.

29:26.916 --> 29:30.208
Me and my divers will be
all eyes and ears doing our sweeps,

29:30.208 --> 29:32.000
ready if, God forbid,
the shield goes down.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.041
I'd... I'd like to know
what weapons you use.

29:34.041 --> 29:36.708
Is it like spear guns, or... or--

29:36.708 --> 29:38.958
Poles with tennis balls.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.750
We won't harm 'em.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.958
You know, just a prod on the snout.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.250
So, no weapons.

29:47.291 --> 29:50.000
Look, Diana, we'll protect you, all right?

29:50.583 --> 29:52.083
But you gotta remember,

29:52.083 --> 29:54.125
this is their ocean, okay?

29:54.125 --> 29:55.291
You're just passing through.

29:58.291 --> 30:01.791
Just think of the marketing opportunities
with me at the forefront.

30:01.791 --> 30:04.208
I don't know, maybe, "Still dry."

30:04.750 --> 30:06.250
Or just go classic,

30:06.250 --> 30:09.791
me on a billboard with your iconic slogan
ribboned beneath me,

30:09.791 --> 30:12.500
"Strong enough for a man,
but made for a woman."

30:14.208 --> 30:15.208
Oh, of course.

30:16.541 --> 30:17.875
Yeah. Thanks, Deb.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.583
I think
I just scored us a sponsor. [exclaiming]

30:22.583 --> 30:24.000
- Yeah! All right!
- [Diana] Whoo!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.291
So I got a lead on a navigator guy.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.750
- You show me a navigator...
- [Bonnie] He's in from Key West.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.375
- ...that isn't full of shit.
- [Bonnie] You can't drive the boat too.

30:31.375 --> 30:32.375
We need this guy.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.583
Everybody says he's great,
they call him the King of the Gulf.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.375
So, I invited him for lunch tomorrow,

30:38.375 --> 30:41.541
and I'm gonna order you
the fish tacos with the salsa on the side,

30:41.541 --> 30:44.500
and you're gonna be
your most charming self, aren't you?

30:46.958 --> 30:47.875
[Diana] Nice boat.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.333
[seagulls warbling]

30:50.875 --> 30:52.375
I designed her myself.

30:52.375 --> 30:56.875
I had to re-draw
the lines plans, like, 76 times.

30:57.833 --> 31:01.083
My wife thought I was freaking
out of my mind, but she's perfect.

31:01.791 --> 31:04.083
- Your wife or your boat?
- Both of 'em.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.083
John Bartlett.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.708
I used to watch you
on the Wide World of Sports.

31:09.708 --> 31:10.958
Oh yeah?

31:10.958 --> 31:14.000
"Thrill of victory, agony of defeat,"
and all that shit?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.083
I need to see your navigation cabin.

31:18.458 --> 31:19.666
No problemo.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.125
The Gulf Stream's a raging dick.

31:24.125 --> 31:27.458
It's basically a fast-moving river
in the middle of the ocean

31:27.458 --> 31:29.916
going east when you wanna go north.

31:30.500 --> 31:34.041
- If you're not exceeding its speed--
- You're going backwards.

31:34.541 --> 31:35.541
Yes, I know.

31:35.541 --> 31:37.750
You are aware that I've tried this before?

31:37.750 --> 31:38.833
I sure am.

31:38.833 --> 31:41.625
Well, I don't need a primer
on the Gulf Stream, okay?

31:41.625 --> 31:44.833
What I need to know
is what qualifies you for this mission.

31:44.833 --> 31:47.416
- What's your pedigree?
- Wait... wait a minute. What... what is this?

31:47.416 --> 31:49.083
Do you think I'm selling you here,

31:49.083 --> 31:51.416
or do you just have a hair
across your ass?

31:51.416 --> 31:54.250
My last navigator screwed me, okay?

31:54.250 --> 31:57.041
He had me slamming
into the surf for 14 hours straight.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.041
- I would've made it if he hadn't--
- [John] Well, that's on you.

32:00.041 --> 32:02.875
I looked him up,
your old navigator from '78.

32:03.500 --> 32:07.458
America's Cup preppy asshole
who didn't know shit about the Straits.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.583
You can have
all the pedigree in the world,

32:09.583 --> 32:13.375
but if you haven't sailed here,
if you haven't put in your 10,000 hours,

32:13.375 --> 32:15.541
these counter-currents, these eddies,

32:15.541 --> 32:19.708
it's like getting a freaking horse trainer
to install your dishwasher.

32:19.708 --> 32:22.291
- That's poetic.
- Step outside with me for a minute.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.125
Stick out your tongue.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.083
Stick out your tongue.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.833
[dramatic music playing]

32:30.333 --> 32:31.458
[John] You taste that?

32:32.666 --> 32:34.416
- I don't know, salt?
- No.

32:34.416 --> 32:38.208
Sand from the Sahara 7,000 miles away.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.875
That's what this wind'll do.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.250
What you wanna do
has never been done, right?

32:43.250 --> 32:45.625
The course must be exact.

32:45.625 --> 32:48.458
The axis of the stream
has to be calculated by someone

32:48.458 --> 32:50.250
who knows
what the hell they're dealing with

32:50.250 --> 32:53.375
so the stream will work for you,
not against you,

32:53.375 --> 32:55.250
recomputing every 15 minutes.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.750
You're off
a fraction of a degree to the east,

32:57.750 --> 33:01.416
you're headed to the Turks and Caicos,
a fraction to the west, Texas,

33:01.416 --> 33:04.000
or worse, you're spun into an eddy.

33:04.958 --> 33:07.125
So choose the wrong dude again. No biggie.

33:07.666 --> 33:09.625
It just might cost you your life.

33:10.208 --> 33:14.125
Well, thank you
for your interest in the position.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.791
- Bye.
- He'll do.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.208
[Bonnie] Hey... hey, wait.
Uh, what about lunch?

33:31.208 --> 33:32.583
- [John sighing]
- [Bonnie] Huh?

33:33.416 --> 33:35.041
[seagulls warbling]

33:35.041 --> 33:36.291
You got a beer?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.083
- [Bonnie] Yeah.
- I need a beer.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.708
[Bonnie] If anybody
in the world can do it, it's her. Come on.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.208
You must see it, like, a little bit.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.916
Otherwise,
you wouldn't be sitting here, right?

33:46.916 --> 33:48.083
You brought me lunch.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.458
[laughing] Correct, I did.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.583
I'll be honest with you, Bonnie.
I don't know. I really don't.

33:54.583 --> 33:56.208
There's only a few days each year

33:56.208 --> 33:59.166
when the wind direction and the stream
will maybe let a swimmer cross.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.583
Maybe. It's a tiny window.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.333
And even then, she may not make it.

34:04.916 --> 34:05.791
You know?

34:06.458 --> 34:10.000
Plus, your deal is all volunteer, no comp.

34:10.708 --> 34:13.500
We train for months
and may not even get a green light.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.708
[sighing] Yeah.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.125
Wanna know my favorite feeling ever?

34:21.083 --> 34:22.208
[John clearing throat]

34:22.208 --> 34:24.958
When I was...
when I was playing racquetball at my peak,

34:25.625 --> 34:26.833
and I was 30,

34:26.833 --> 34:29.750
and it was just me and the girls
just goofing off all around the country

34:29.750 --> 34:30.875
like brats,

34:31.375 --> 34:36.083
you know, and then... then it's...
it's game day and you get that rush,

34:36.083 --> 34:38.791
like, "I'm gonna win,
I'm gonna win," you know?

34:41.791 --> 34:45.125
I mean, the only way
that I'm gonna get that magic at this age

34:45.791 --> 34:46.791
is through her.

34:47.458 --> 34:51.083
How many more chances are we gonna get
to do heart-pumping shit, huh?

34:53.375 --> 34:54.750
So that's why you're here.

34:56.541 --> 34:58.916
Yeah, that and she needs me.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.375
Don't ask me why.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.166
[Bonnie chuckling]

35:02.166 --> 35:05.750
And we really need you.
I promise you, it won't be boring.

35:06.416 --> 35:08.791
Some people say boring is underrated.

35:09.916 --> 35:11.916
Wild guess, you're not one of 'em.

35:11.916 --> 35:14.000
[both chuckling]

35:21.625 --> 35:23.583
- [Bonnie] Yikes. Bad.
- [Diana wincing]

35:24.458 --> 35:27.416
[Bonnie] I'm gonna call around,
see what people are using.

35:28.916 --> 35:33.041
And, uh, you know, we got some good ideas
about how to keep you following the boat.

35:33.750 --> 35:36.083
How you feeling? Ready for the overnight?

35:37.375 --> 35:39.166
- Yeah. [wincing]
- Yeah.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.958
- Yes, yes.
- Well, you look great.

35:40.958 --> 35:44.458
Look, hardening up. How's that shoulder?
Still seizing up on you?

35:44.458 --> 35:45.875
It's... it's not too bad.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.875
How about... how about your mind?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.083
Like on the long swims?

35:51.791 --> 35:52.708
[Diana] It's good.

35:52.708 --> 35:55.500
I've got my playlist up to about 85 songs.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
Neil Young, Janis Joplin, The Beatles.

35:57.500 --> 36:02.083
If I sing "No Reply" 1,000 times in a row,
that's 9 hours and 45 minutes to the beat.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.458
I may need one more song, though,

36:03.458 --> 36:05.750
but it has to be
in 4/4 time to go with the stroke.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.458
Also, just so you know,

36:12.541 --> 36:15.291
if you find yourself going someplace dark,

36:15.958 --> 36:18.541
you know, find yourself beating up
on yourself just--

36:18.541 --> 36:19.875
I said I'm fine.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.000
Let me do that, okay?

36:23.166 --> 36:24.041
All right.

36:24.041 --> 36:25.416
[Diana groaning]

36:29.333 --> 36:30.166
Okay.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.291
[seagulls warbling]

36:33.291 --> 36:36.000
[Bonnie] Everybody, all right, listen up.

36:36.666 --> 36:38.250
So, 24-hour training swim.

36:38.250 --> 36:41.625
Uh, this is our lovely Dee,
she's our captain.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.958
When she's at the helm,
nobody talks to her. All right?

36:44.958 --> 36:47.000
[whispering] I've never heard
that woman speak,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.583
but she's the best in the biz.

36:48.583 --> 36:52.083
Same goes for the swimmer.
When in the water, no talking to her.

36:52.083 --> 36:54.541
No joking. Serious business.

36:54.541 --> 36:56.833
On our way, let's go.
You guys know each other.

36:56.833 --> 36:57.833
Hey, Dee.

36:58.333 --> 37:00.291
Yeah, the red light was Nico's idea.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.916
We can't train a spotlight on you.

37:01.916 --> 37:04.083
That'd send
all kinds of creatures after you.

37:04.083 --> 37:06.166
But they don't like red.

37:06.666 --> 37:07.500
Wow.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.791
If we can't get something into her gut,
her body will start eating itself.

37:12.166 --> 37:16.375
So, feedings every 90 minutes,
but you never tell her what time it is.

37:17.166 --> 37:21.458
And, uh, you know,
try not to... to bump up against the ego.

37:21.958 --> 37:24.666
You know, don't yell at her.
She does not respond well to tough love.

37:25.625 --> 37:26.958
But don't baby her either.

37:26.958 --> 37:30.333
When she starts to hallucinate,
you go with it. Okay?

37:30.333 --> 37:31.666
Okay, let's show her.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.250
Oh, hey, check it out.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.958
Bartlett made you a lane
so you can stay closer to the boat.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.416
- You did that?
- [John] I did.

37:40.916 --> 37:42.916
[dramatic music playing]

37:46.625 --> 37:48.625
[boat engine revving]

37:53.791 --> 37:56.250
[Diana] <i>The mind deteriorates
along with the body.</i>

37:56.250 --> 37:58.666
<i>When the body weakens
and the hallucinations start,</i>

37:58.666 --> 37:59.916
<i>it's like sensory deprivation.</i>

37:59.916 --> 38:02.541
<i>I thought
that gulls were dive-bombing my calf</i>

38:02.541 --> 38:04.791
<i>and I thought there was blood
down the front of my face.</i>

38:04.791 --> 38:05.791
<i>I can barely see.</i>

38:05.791 --> 38:08.458
<i>The mental stress
that you go through is unbelievable,</i>

38:08.458 --> 38:09.708
<i>just about torture.</i>

38:09.708 --> 38:12.416
<i>I was vomiting
and I was losing all my strength and...</i>

38:12.416 --> 38:13.500
[Diana retching]

38:13.500 --> 38:15.583
[Diana counting indistinctly]

38:17.791 --> 38:20.291
[man] Can you read what it says
after Nyad?

38:20.291 --> 38:22.375
That is your name, Diana.

38:22.375 --> 38:24.250
<i>This is your destiny.</i>

38:24.250 --> 38:26.500
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:26.500 --> 38:29.791
[man] <i>So after your turn,
I wanna see you increase that stroke rate.</i>

38:29.791 --> 38:31.291
[Diana retching]

38:32.250 --> 38:33.291
Wait, what is that?

38:33.875 --> 38:35.541
Oh, uh...

38:35.541 --> 38:37.958
- What? Let me see.
- [Diana] I was just kidding.

38:42.291 --> 38:43.916
- [Coach Nelson chuckling]
- [Diana sighing]

38:43.916 --> 38:47.500
[Diana retching, groaning]

38:47.500 --> 38:49.125
Why are you throwing up?

38:49.916 --> 38:51.750
Because... [groaning]

38:52.625 --> 38:56.083
...because I just swam for 24 hours.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.250
[Diana retching]

38:57.250 --> 38:59.708
Hey, visas came through.
We're cleared for Cuba.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.708
[Diana moaning]

39:00.708 --> 39:01.958
- Better?
- [Diana] Yeah.

39:01.958 --> 39:04.708
- All right. High-five.
- [Diana breathing heavily]

39:05.458 --> 39:06.583
[Sawyer] Finally tonight,

39:06.583 --> 39:09.333
someone who was a kind of hero
for so many of us,

39:09.333 --> 39:12.666
Diana Nyad, the incredible swimmer,

39:12.666 --> 39:16.375
is back and about to embark
on something we couldn't believe.

39:16.375 --> 39:20.541
[reporter] <i>...set her sights on conquering
a feat that has eluded her for 30 years.</i>

39:20.541 --> 39:23.625
[Diana in Spanish]
I hope to encourage unity

39:23.625 --> 39:28.250
and good relations
between our two countries.

39:28.250 --> 39:30.208
A connection.

39:31.791 --> 39:36.666
And I can't wait to set off
as soon as the weather allows.

39:37.625 --> 39:38.458
Thank you.

39:41.791 --> 39:44.708
- [indistinct chatter, laughing]
- [Latin jazz music playing]

39:44.708 --> 39:47.875
[John speaking indistinctly]

39:51.875 --> 39:52.875
[Diana] Uh, you know what?

39:53.458 --> 39:56.666
I-- There's something
I wanna say to all of you.

39:56.666 --> 39:58.666
[music fades]

39:59.250 --> 40:02.416
[smacking lips]
As we await the signal from Mother Nature,

40:02.416 --> 40:07.750
I signed a contract
with my soul to never, ever give up.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.375
You've all sacrificed a great deal.

40:11.041 --> 40:14.166
No money, no perks, no guarantees.

40:14.750 --> 40:18.625
But I can think of
no worthier cause for such sacrifice.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.500
My life's mission, dare I say my destiny,

40:21.500 --> 40:24.666
to fight
the wildly unpredictable conditions,

40:24.666 --> 40:26.333
to tangle with the elements.

40:26.333 --> 40:29.083
I will be the first Nyad.

40:29.083 --> 40:32.000
If you look my name up in the dictionary,
you will see...

40:32.000 --> 40:33.875
- That's great.
- ...literally "water nymph."

40:33.875 --> 40:38.041
Thank you so much.
And... and... to... to... to destiny.

40:38.041 --> 40:41.500
- To all of us. To Cuba. Okay?
- [all] To Cuba.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.333
- To waiting for the weather.
- Yes.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.833
[thunder rumbling]

40:52.833 --> 40:55.500
If we don't get out in a couple of weeks,
temp drops.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.375
- A year down the drain.
- Yeah.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.083
So, how's it looking?

41:01.166 --> 41:03.500
I... I got three different forecasters,

41:03.500 --> 41:05.541
both for weather
and the axis of the stream.

41:05.541 --> 41:07.708
One in Maryland, one in Washington,

41:07.708 --> 41:09.500
one in the Miami Hurricane Center.

41:09.500 --> 41:12.208
- I'm... I'm comparing their models.
- And?

41:12.208 --> 41:14.250
And it's Russian Roulette.

41:14.250 --> 41:17.000
We might have a window
when this clears. Might.

41:18.083 --> 41:21.916
I'd put our chances at marginal to fair.

41:25.458 --> 41:27.458
[Diana panting]

41:28.541 --> 41:29.500
[knocking on door]

41:29.500 --> 41:30.791
- [Diana exhaling]
- Hey.

41:31.291 --> 41:32.541
[Diana] I gotta get out of here.

41:32.541 --> 41:34.375
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

41:34.375 --> 41:36.166
Go for a run or something.

41:36.916 --> 41:38.875
[scoffing] Have you looked outside?

41:38.875 --> 41:40.625
Yeah. Well, I have to stay ready.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.083
[Bonnie] Uh, you are ready.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.500
I bumped into you in the kitchen,
it was like walking into a brick wall.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.458
All right, look,
I... I don't want you to burn out,

41:48.458 --> 41:50.958
so just sit still, be patient.

41:50.958 --> 41:52.375
I know it's hard. It's hard.

41:52.375 --> 41:55.291
No, you actually don't know.
You don't have to do it.

41:55.291 --> 41:57.541
[scoffing] It's easy
for you to say that, right?

41:57.541 --> 41:59.458
[scoffing] Yeah? Cut the shit.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.125
All right? All this "me-me-me-me" crap.

42:02.125 --> 42:04.166
- [Diana] What?
- I remortgaged my house for this--

42:04.166 --> 42:05.208
Yeah, so did I.

42:05.208 --> 42:08.166
Well, then the correct response
would be "thank you."

42:08.833 --> 42:10.458
Oh, so you're just gonna leave?

42:10.458 --> 42:11.958
No, no, go ahead, fine.

42:11.958 --> 42:15.458
Okay. No, go ahead. It's okay.
Just go smoke a joint or something.

42:15.458 --> 42:17.666
Why don't you do some yoga? Read a book.

42:18.375 --> 42:19.541
I didn't bring a book!

42:20.291 --> 42:22.291
[rain pattering]

42:32.125 --> 42:33.250
[seagulls warbling]

42:33.250 --> 42:35.208
[rooster crowing]

42:37.125 --> 42:38.125
[knocking on door]

42:41.583 --> 42:42.708
Storm's over.

42:43.875 --> 42:45.041
It's our window.

42:45.541 --> 42:47.333
This is it, Diana. It's go time.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.041
[contemplative music playing]

42:51.958 --> 42:54.000

Put it right up there.
Give me a good breath. One good breath.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.333
Good.

54:43.333 --> 54:45.416
[Diana breathing heavily]

54:46.291 --> 54:47.125
Don't...

54:49.000 --> 54:51.708
don't wanna give up.

54:53.458 --> 54:56.208
- [music fades]
- [Diana] Don't... don't wanna give up.

54:56.208 --> 54:57.791
[whispering] I know, I know.

55:13.291 --> 55:16.875
[Bonnie breathing deeply, exhaling]

55:16.875 --> 55:19.333
So, she wants to keep going.

55:20.791 --> 55:21.708
She's stable.

55:24.125 --> 55:26.166
So, what's our position?

55:27.333 --> 55:28.625
Are you serious?

55:29.625 --> 55:32.666
She could die at any second
and you wanna know our position?

55:32.666 --> 55:34.208
The hell are we doing here?

55:34.208 --> 55:36.000
It's her dream. Right?

55:36.000 --> 55:37.458
It's... it's her call.

55:37.458 --> 55:40.541
And we're already all the way out here.

55:40.541 --> 55:41.666
[John sighing]

55:43.750 --> 55:44.583
Yeah.

55:46.791 --> 55:47.666
All right.

55:48.541 --> 55:49.791
If you can live with it.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.833
Just read me our position, please.

55:58.916 --> 56:00.791
So the UMiami folks think

56:00.791 --> 56:03.583
that the box jellyfish came up
off the shallow reef when we left Cuba.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.958
Global warming.
Apparently, they're breeding like crazy.

56:06.958 --> 56:08.958
But they should be behind us now.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.666
And, uh, Bartlett said
that we didn't drift too badly

56:12.666 --> 56:14.666
because you were doing so good before.

56:14.666 --> 56:16.416
Good time, you know?

56:16.416 --> 56:19.125
But you got to take it easy.
All right? Slow.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.208
[Diana groaning, panting]

56:26.333 --> 56:27.541
All right, let's go.

56:30.333 --> 56:31.916
All right, everybody, we're going.

56:32.583 --> 56:35.833
Come on! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

56:37.750 --> 56:38.916
[boat engine revving]

56:45.250 --> 56:47.125
[tense music playing]

56:51.500 --> 56:52.750
It's for the jellyfish.

56:53.458 --> 56:54.500
Just in case.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.333
Fantastic.

57:00.750 --> 57:01.833
The stop kill us?

57:01.833 --> 57:03.750
[John] Trying to make a correction

57:03.750 --> 57:07.541
for a little northeasterly drift,
but I like our position.

57:08.583 --> 57:10.208
[Bonnie] Wow. You never like our position.

57:10.208 --> 57:11.208
I know.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.166
I gotta tell you, Bon,
she's making up time.

57:14.166 --> 57:18.375
We're 45.2 statute miles from the marina.

57:18.375 --> 57:21.958
She keeps going like this,
we're gonna see Florida before sunrise.

57:25.625 --> 57:26.875
[Diana groaning]

57:32.750 --> 57:33.583
Look at you.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.791
You're good to go.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.000
Looks good. Beautiful.

57:38.583 --> 57:39.416
Onward.

57:40.958 --> 57:41.791
Yeah.

57:48.625 --> 57:50.625
[dramatic music playing]

58:01.750 --> 58:03.958
[Coach Nelson] <i>This is why we swim
that extra lap,</i>

58:03.958 --> 58:05.500
<i>this is why we run that extra mile,</i>

58:05.500 --> 58:08.708
<i>this is why we push you
to your limit every single day.</i>

58:08.708 --> 58:10.875
You give me everything you got out there,

58:11.375 --> 58:15.166
all your heart,
all your strength, all your focus,

58:16.583 --> 58:19.083
I guarantee you
you're gonna leave here a champion.

58:19.583 --> 58:20.916
- You hear me?
- [girls] Yes.

58:21.500 --> 58:24.166
Panthers on three. One, two, three.

58:24.166 --> 58:25.083
[all] Panthers!

58:25.083 --> 58:27.458
- [crowd cheering]
- [Coach Nelson] Dig deep, Nyad. Come on!

58:27.958 --> 58:29.500
Come on! Come on!

58:30.416 --> 58:31.541
Come on, come on!

58:32.041 --> 58:32.916
Come on, Nyad!

58:33.625 --> 58:36.666
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! You did it!
- [crowd cheering]

58:39.916 --> 58:41.583
- [Diana] No!
- [girls giggling]

58:41.583 --> 58:42.916
Stop! No!

58:42.916 --> 58:44.000
[girls exclaiming]

58:44.000 --> 58:46.083
[dramatic music playing]

59:03.166 --> 59:05.166
[dramatic music swelling]

59:27.375 --> 59:28.750
[suspenseful music playing]

59:31.291 --> 59:32.916
[Diana screaming]

59:32.916 --> 59:35.166
[Diana] My face! My face!

59:35.666 --> 59:36.708
Tentacles.

59:36.708 --> 59:38.708
[Bonnie] Right!
Get... get her out of the water!

59:38.708 --> 59:39.666
Right now!

59:40.500 --> 59:42.166
- [Diana gasping]
- [Bonnie] Get her out!

59:42.166 --> 59:43.500
Diana, stay there!

59:47.375 --> 59:50.208
[suspenseful music swelling]

59:56.708 --> 59:57.541
[music fades]

59:57.541 --> 59:59.458
[dramatic music playing]

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.541
[indistinct chatter]

01:00:02.416 --> 01:00:03.375
Hey, Nyad?

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:05.958
Nyad?

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:08.916
[Coach Nelson chuckling]

01:00:08.916 --> 01:00:12.000
If you wanna catch a nap,
guest room down the hall. Go ahead.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:26.250
[tense music playing]

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:32.166
[Bonnie] What's going on? What's going on?

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:33.708
[Jon] Nothing. [panting]

01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.958
[Bonnie] No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:37.750
Come on. Come on, Diana.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.416
You can't... you can't do that now.
You gotta breathe.

01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:42.125
<i>Come on, baby, breathe.</i>

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.541
Breathe, you breathe deep.

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:47.833
I know you got another one in you.
Come on, give me another one.

01:00:47.833 --> 01:00:49.083
Give me another breath.

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:50.583
[Bonnie breathing heavily]

01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:53.666
[Bonnie] Come on.
Stop messing with me, Diana. Breathe, now.

01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:54.791
[Diana gasping]

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.166
What happened?
What happened? What happened?

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:04.958
Blow out. Blow out,
blow out, blow out, blow out.

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:07.333
Come on, blow out, blow out. Blow out!

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:09.125
Diana, blow out. Now, blow out.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.208
[Diana exhaling]

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.083
Oh God.

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:16.875
Oh Jesus.

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:19.875
[John] Bonnie, Bonnie,
Bonnie, Bonnie, feel this.

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:23.375
Yeah. [panting]

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:25.125
She still thinks she's swimming.

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:31.458
[Bonnie chuckling]

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.291
[Bonnie] You still swimming, babe?

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:37.291
All right, all right, you keep swimming.

01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.041
And keep breathing.

01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:46.750
[Diana sniffling]

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.125
[exhaling]

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:07.000
I should've pulled her out.

01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:10.166
I should've said,
"That's it. No, we're done."

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.791
Why am I not allowed to say

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:22.625
that it pisses me off
to be felled by sea creatures,

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:25.291
to be rendered powerless
by stupid jellyfish?

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.583
It's just so beneath me.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
When you... when you say it's beneath you,

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:33.750
that is just demeaning to us.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:37.333
To all of us. To me, to Bartlett,
Jon Rose, to Luke, to Dee.

01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:40.125
- We worked hard, Diana.
- I know you did.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.958
Yeah, and we were scared shitless.

01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:46.083
- You've any idea what it was like for me?
- [Diana] I know.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:47.625
No, no, you don't know.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:50.125
I watched you die, Diana.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:53.833
For 15 seconds, I thought you were dead.

01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:58.958
All because I said okay to you again.

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.250
I said, "Oh yeah, okay, sure."

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.500
I... I can't do that again. I can't.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.916
Yeah, but I wasn't. I didn't. I'm here.

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:10.083
I'm... I'm here,
I'm okay, and I'm not quitting.

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:11.166
Okay?

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:14.916
We have learned so much each time.
I've... I've learned about myself, too.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.041
Yeah, okay, what... what did you learn?

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.958
I don't wanna look back
and feel like I could've fought harder.

01:03:19.958 --> 01:03:21.125
I hate that feeling.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.166
[Bonnie] I know that. What else?

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.750
Look... look, one more time.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.583
One more time. That's it.

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:29.250
We spend the next year training,

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:33.958
but also fixing the jellyfish problem.

01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:38.666
I actually got a lead
on a box jellyfish expert.

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:42.583
How do you already have a lead
on a box jellyfish expert?

01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:45.208
It's called the internet, Bonnie.

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:49.458
Look, she's a doctor.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.083
She seems like a really cool lady.

01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:56.750
Do you have any idea
how exhausting you are as a friend?

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.875
[woman] In the future,
never let them give her an Epi injection.

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:02.958
Box stings cause epinephrine to spike.

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:04.666
She's lucky she didn't overdose.

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:10.125
Uh, listen, I told her I was only going
if I could protect her from the box.

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:12.416
So, what do you think? Is this crazy?

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:14.000
She can't get stung again.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.958
You don't build up immunity to the venom.
It works in the opposite way.

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:19.666
- [Bonnie sighing]
- So there cannot be a next time.

01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:23.416
The suit, I designed it expressly
for this purpose. It'll help.

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:26.250
But yeah, I'd say this is pretty crazy,

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:28.291
but it's also very punk rock.

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:30.208
[dramatic music playing]

01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:34.000
Hello? Bonnie?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.625
This is brutal.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.333
Yeah. Well, we can't help you.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.333
It's regulation.
You gotta put it on yourself.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.166
Well, I can't do it.

01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:44.500
Then don't.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.375
But you will die.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:51.750
[Diana] Listen, could you come with us?

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.750
It would be a great adventure.

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.875

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.875
Yeah, we know no one's been able to do it.

01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:27.541
- That's the whole damn point!
- Hey! Can you stop talking? I wanna hear.

I can't believe this.

This... this is my window.
She's stealing my swim!

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:42.166
That-- No, that's what I'm gonna do.

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:45.000
God! Where's a box jellyfish
when you need one?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.875
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.958
[birds chirping]

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:52.000
- It stopped.
- [dog panting]

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.750
Okay, her tracker stopped.

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:55.375
Where?

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:56.875
Where'd it stop?

01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.875
- Right there.
- What?

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:02.250
Is it instrument failure? Or, wait.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.708
- Wait--
- Did they pull her out?

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:05.833
Lookit, lookit, lookit. Wait a minute.

01:06:06.708 --> 01:06:07.541

Bonnie.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.041
- What?
- We have got to go to Cuba, now.

01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:43.708
All of my models say no, all right?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.833
We've got the Atlantic gyre
stalled above the 17th parallel,

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.500
we've got storm systems
coming off the coast of Africa,

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.041
not to mention the Gulf.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:55.375
We'll have nothing but huge peaks
if we bump up against that damn east wind.

01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:56.875
This is not our window.

01:06:57.416 --> 01:07:00.541
- Well, just check the models again.
- My models are good, I'm sorry.

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:02.958
Do you like the idea
of a full-tilt current?

toward the Bahamas?

Does that sound like fun to you?

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:12.875
If we wait any longer,
the season will end. It will be too cold.

Look, it's not the only swim in the world.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:21.875
You know we could go someplace else.
Guam is nice this time of year.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.500
- Guam?
- [John] What's wrong with Guam?

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.541
It's not Cuba!

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.125
[John] When are you gonna listen
to my expertise, Diana?

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.833
Oh, that's right, you know everything.

01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:31.916
No, you're the expert. Fine.
But I'm the CEO of the operation.

01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:33.916
- The CEO?
- [Diana] We're going.

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:37.541
- I'm not waiting a year in training again.
- It's too dangerous, Diana.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:41.791
I pinged my weather guy in Atlanta,
and Greg says we are good to go.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.875
Oh, well, if Greg says so.
Who the hell is Greg?

01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:47.333
I've never even heard of him.
This isn't his call.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.875
Yeah, you're right. It's not. It's mine.

01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:52.916
I'm in charge. That's the deal.
And guess what? We're going.

Can we talk?

01:08:17.458 --> 01:08:19.708

[Bonnie sighing heavily]

01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:26.041
Does she think
I don't wanna get out there?

01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:29.583
Elke and I canceled
seven charters this month

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:30.833
so I could do this.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.500
I'm trying to look out
for people's lives here.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.708
I know. I know.

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.375
Jesus, and, I mean, look at you.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.791
I've ... I've watched you stand
on that transom

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:43.833
for 40 hours straight
peeing over the side of the boat

01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:46.916
so you didn't have to leave her
for a second. Does she see that?

01:08:46.916 --> 01:08:48.791
Does she ever say thank you?

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.458
- She does, in her own way--
- She plays you like a fiddle.

01:08:51.458 --> 01:08:53.166
Hey. Look, you don't know.

01:08:53.166 --> 01:08:55.500
- I mean, she and I, we--
- Oh, come on, Bonnie.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.291
You put her over your own
better judgment every single time.

01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.333
Look, it's a risk.

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:05.208
Okay? Shit.

01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:08.041
I mean, we've come this far.

01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:09.291
We gotta let her try.

01:09:10.833 --> 01:09:13.750
[clicking tongue] Oh, come on.
What... what are you gonna do?

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.500
You gonna go home
and you gonna sail around

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.791

that only you could do.

For once this is about me!

And... and you don't...
you don't... you don't even think of me.

You just... you just want me
to, like, tag along with you.

01:15:16.833 --> 01:15:18.666
No, of course I think about you.

01:15:18.666 --> 01:15:21.125
I know what you're capable of
better than you do.

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:23.541
Listen to yourself.
That is so patronizing. I can't--

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:27.041
Look, I know
that the world wants me to shut my mouth

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:29.708
and sit down and wait to die,

01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:31.000

I can't.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.291
I won't. I will not accept defeat.

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:41.125
[dog barking]

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:43.541
Are you with me?

01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:50.125
No.

[Diana panting]

01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:23.958
Yeah, but your coach.
Here you are, resting up to compete.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:26.375
When your mind
and your body have to be in sync.

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:28.458
[Diana] <i>And you think I swam well
in the state meets?</i>

01:16:28.458 --> 01:16:31.083
<i>He would say, you know,
"You can't tell anyone about this."</i>

01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:32.541
<i>"First, it's so special."</i>

01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:36.250
<i>"We have something so special,
so you can't tell anybody."</i>

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.583
<i>"No one will understand."</i>

01:16:37.583 --> 01:16:42.125
<i>"You'll be kicked out of school
and you'll never be the Olympic swimmer</i>

[Diana] Attempt number four.

01:16:57.375 --> 01:17:00.583
Here I am at the launch, nerves screaming.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:04.208
No idea what lies ahead of me
but resolved by sheer will,

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.625
compelled by the power
of the human spirit.

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:11.250
Courage.

01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:17.958
Uh, this is Bonnie, my coach.

01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:20.458
[Diana's breath shuddering]

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:26.333
She is in charge of making sure
that I get my calories and electrolytes.

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:31.708
Bonnie again.

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:34.833
Uh...

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:41.000
You... you don't leave room
for imagining defeat.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.625
You really do believe

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:45.291
that you're going to make it
every single time,

01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:47.791
but...

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.375
Um, I mean,

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.000
four tries and four failures.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:02.583
[elevator chiming]

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.333
Okay.

01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:12.791
Oh.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.333
[indistinct chatter]

01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.958
Oh come on, Nyad, stupid bitch.

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:23.583

01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:38.125
Yep?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.875
Uh, are you still mad at me?

01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:43.958
Because I am so sorry.

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:47.125
Some of the things I said,

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:52.375
and my attitude,
was... it... out of proportion.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:54.708
Thank you.

01:18:56.291 --> 01:18:57.708
And no, I'm not mad.

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:02.916
But if you're asking me to go again,
I... I... I just can't.

01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:06.541
You know, I... I got shit going on.

01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:11.958
<i>Mortgage to pay, you know?
I gotta get back to work, you know?</i>

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.250
Life catches up at some point.

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:18.375
Yeah, no, I understand.

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:22.375
Maybe it just can't be done, you know?

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:23.750
What, I'm... [sighing]

01:19:24.666 --> 01:19:26.166
I'm just supposed to accept

01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:30.250
everyone's denigrating
and mediocre standards of what's possible?

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:31.416
[John chuckling]

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.750
Bonnie's done with me, too.

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:36.708
Oh, cut the shit, Bonnie loves you.

01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:37.875
You two are family.

01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:43.375
You know, it's not
that I don't know that I'm this way,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.500
that... that I'm so...

01:19:47.208 --> 01:19:48.125
Radical?

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.500
That's a nice way to say it.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.708
[John chuckling]

01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:53.750
Why is it so hard?

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah, why is it so hard
to be a person?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.166
[Diana laughing]

01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:02.291
You know,
there was nothing like that feeling,

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:06.708
being out there on those days
when we were just jamming

01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:09.791
<i>and... and you were going strong</i>

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:12.208
and the dolphins were following you,

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:17.000
and... and me and Bonnie and the team
were super in sync thinking,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.041
"Hell yeah, we... we can do this.
We... we can pull this off."

01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:23.541
This... this crazy thing we all believed in.

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:26.041
That high.

01:20:28.666 --> 01:20:31.000
Yeah, that...
that was some good shit, right?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Yeah, no, I...
I never saw that, but I felt it.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.333
Oh, that's true.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:39.291
- You know, you... you were underwater.
- [Diana] <i>Yeah.</i>

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:42.375
Singing to myself in the dark. [chuckling]

01:20:42.375 --> 01:20:43.416
[John chuckling]

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:45.833
Kind of badass, Diana.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:47.041
<i>Very much so.</i>

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:48.458
[Diana sighing]

01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:55.833
Well, uh, I... I... I... I'd better--

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:58.083
No, no, yeah, yeah, of course.

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:00.583
Goodnight, John.

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:01.833
Goodnight, Diana.

01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:11.416
[birds chirping]

01:21:13.166 --> 01:21:14.208
[car door closing]

01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:18.208
[Diana] I've been calling.

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:19.458
- I left messages.
- Oh.

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:23.375
Diana, I just...
I... I don't wanna get into this again.

01:21:23.375 --> 01:21:24.833
No, no, I know.

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:29.083
I just wanted to see you, talk to you.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.583
[softly] Fine.

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.000
[Bonnie sighing]

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:45.125
I read in the paper
that, uh, Jack Nelson died.

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:46.458
Yeah.

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.541
I thought you'd call me.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:52.416
Well, good riddance.

01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:56.583
I hate victim shit.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:57.625
I know you do.

01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:00.875
Yeah, he's still
in the Swimming Hall of Fame

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:02.833
even after all of us came forward,

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:05.166
said we were abused by him,
said it in public.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.625
Can you believe that?

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:07.541
God!

01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:09.416
[Bonnie seething]

01:22:09.416 --> 01:22:12.083
I... I... I wish I could've killed him myself.

01:22:12.708 --> 01:22:14.416
- And I would have, too.
- Yeah?

01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:16.208
- Yeah.
- How would you have done it?

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:18.000
[exhaling]

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.250
Chop his dick off.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:20.208
Oh.

01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:24.458
Dull knife, granite cutting board.
Just let him bleed to death.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.291
Why granite?

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:29.083
I don't know,
that's just how I pictured it.

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:33.250
Yeah. Well, he didn't damage me,
he didn't throw me off course.

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:35.166
I'm good, I'm fine.

01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:39.708
But then there are moments
when it's like I'm 14 again and...

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.791
it's... it's like his voice
is coming out of me,

01:22:45.791 --> 01:22:49.041
and I get so mad at myself.

01:22:49.916 --> 01:22:52.416
[voice breaking]
I mean, why didn't I fight harder?

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.000
I was a force.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.666
Oh baby, baby, you know...
you know it doesn't work like that.

01:22:57.666 --> 01:22:58.666
You know that.

01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:01.000
I do. I do know that.

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:02.666
It's just, I...

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:04.666
I mean, I...

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:06.791
[Diana exhaling]

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.416
He was so nice to me.

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:11.583
I mean, at first, you know.

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:17.458
I... I wrote "I love Coach Nelson"
on my notebook,

01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:20.916
and he saw that I...

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:23.833
[Diana crying softly]

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:28.500
You know?
Oh God, I never told anybody that.

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:29.916
Hey.

01:23:32.291 --> 01:23:33.375
[Diana sobbing]

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.833
You are a force.

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:39.583
Swim or no swim, you are a force.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:41.291
Know that.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.083
[sniffling] I know.

01:23:46.791 --> 01:23:48.833
And I, um... I'm not gonna stop.

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:52.625
I'm free to keep trying.

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:54.750
[Bonnie] Yeah, you are, Diana.

01:23:56.416 --> 01:23:57.541
[Diana] So, I'm gonna...

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.375
train and crew up,

01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:04.583
and, uh, see you when I get back.

01:24:04.583 --> 01:24:06.875
- We'll have dinner or something.
- [Bonnie] Sure.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:07.791
Okay.

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:10.750
You know I'm always rooting for you.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.583

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:32.625
[Diana] Hey, James?

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:38.833
I want you drafting to my left, okay,
so I can see you when I breathe.

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:40.166
And every 90 minutes,

01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:43.666
if you could grab one of those, uh,
packets of goo from the cooler.

01:24:43.666 --> 01:24:47.250
Bonnie, my handler, she usually
just squirts it directly into my mouth.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.791
You know what? Never mind.

01:24:51.208 --> 01:24:52.125
It's okay.

01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:57.166
And... and I'll...
I'll be ready in a few minutes.

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:00.958
[dog panting]

01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:07.250
Gus, want to take a hike?

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:09.125
Hmm?

01:53:15.958 --> 01:53:18.541
- Bonnie?
- She's backstage and she shook my hand.

01:53:18.541 --> 01:53:20.000
- She's a badass.
- Yeah.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.708
Diana tells really great stories,
but with her... when I'm involved in 'em,

01:53:23.708 --> 01:53:25.541
I don't like the little embellishment.

01:53:25.541 --> 01:53:26.458
It's not exact--

01:53:26.458 --> 01:53:29.333
Just so you know,
the big picture is the same,

01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:33.041
it never looks exactly like she's saying.

01:53:33.041 --> 01:53:34.750
[reporters laughing]

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:36.125
Thank you.

01:53:36.125 --> 01:53:39.750
Diana Nyad, I challenged you.

01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:41.333
You chickened out.

01:53:41.333 --> 01:53:45.208
You swam to Cuba
with all the sharks and the jellyfish,

01:53:45.708 --> 01:53:48.458
but you're afraid to wrestle me?

01:53:48.458 --> 01:53:50.541
You came to America in a boat?

I get in my gym.
