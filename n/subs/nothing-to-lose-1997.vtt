00:17.202 --> 00:19.075
Where do I start?

00:25.252 --> 00:27.161
It's not you.

00:28.714 --> 00:31.085
Well, actually, it is you.

00:33.220 --> 00:36.255
Look, I'm just not...

00:36.389 --> 00:39.260
I'm not attracted
to you any more.

00:41.311 --> 00:43.184
I need space.

00:45.483 --> 00:47.356
You kinda...

00:49.069 --> 00:52.770
You kinda gross me out.

00:55.491 --> 00:57.700
In the beginning,
it was different.

00:57.829 --> 01:00.284
In the beginning,
you were better.

01:00.414 --> 01:04.873
But then I got to know you
real well, and...

01:05.001 --> 01:07.874
I... I came to realize...

01:11.259 --> 01:13.335
that you're a fat idiot.

01:15.763 --> 01:17.672
I got ya.
I got ya.

01:17.764 --> 01:19.676
Okay. Okay.

01:19.769 --> 01:22.057
Okay, okay, okay.
Let me try it.

01:22.145 --> 01:24.102
- You gotta be straight. Straight face.
- Okay. Okay.

01:24.231 --> 01:26.270
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.400
I want a divorce.

01:29.485 --> 01:31.895
Why?

01:31.990 --> 01:34.906
It's a physical thing.

01:34.992 --> 01:37.234
Physical?

01:37.369 --> 01:40.572
I've been experimenting
with other men lately.

01:40.705 --> 01:44.456
A lot of other men...
and women.

01:44.586 --> 01:47.207
I don't know.

01:47.296 --> 01:51.081
I mean, Antonio can do
this thing with his tongue,

01:51.216 --> 01:55.631
and William's stamina is amazing.

01:55.765 --> 01:59.927
And as far as hands go,
well, your father's hands are...

02:02.604 --> 02:05.438
You are no match.
I have no equal.

02:05.565 --> 02:08.816
Get down here.

02:08.943 --> 02:11.862
¶ If the shoe fits ¶

02:12.114 --> 02:15.114
¶ I want you to wear it
and wear it good ¶

02:17.871 --> 02:21.820
¶ Sulkin' about them times
when I was by myself ¶

02:21.958 --> 02:26.168
¶ I was always lookin'
for somebody else ¶

02:26.295 --> 02:30.757
¶ But as time went on
I had a talk with my mind ¶

02:30.843 --> 02:34.840
¶ Friends like you and you
I gotta leave behind ¶

02:34.971 --> 02:37.297
¶ And I'm sayin'
Call me a fool ¶

02:37.432 --> 02:39.720
¶ 'Cause you only
rub it in ¶

02:39.850 --> 02:44.679
- ¶ And I'll never see you
if I had known ¶
- ¶ I'll never see them again ¶

02:44.815 --> 02:48.433
¶ 'Cause, well, I know the difference
Just stay in my own business ¶

02:48.527 --> 02:51.693
¶ And I'll never, ever
dump it on you ¶

02:53.825 --> 02:57.905
¶ Friends and enemies
around me every day ¶

02:58.037 --> 03:02.366
¶ I can't believe
the things they say ¶

03:02.499 --> 03:07.043
¶ Takin' me for granted
Give me no credit at all ¶

03:07.172 --> 03:11.750
¶ I'll just keep bouncin'
like a bouncin' ball ¶

03:11.885 --> 03:13.758
¶¶

03:18.684 --> 03:21.056
¶ I don't wanna step
on nobody's foot but ¶

03:21.186 --> 03:24.057
¶¶

03:29.404 --> 03:33.235
¶ You call me a fool
but you only rub it in ¶

03:33.366 --> 03:36.319
¶ And I'll never see you
if I had known ¶

03:36.410 --> 03:38.319
¶ I'll never see that again ¶

03:38.412 --> 03:42.541
¶ 'Cause, well I know the difference
Just stay in my own business ¶

03:42.625 --> 03:46.326
¶ I'll never, ever
depend on you ¶¶

04:04.858 --> 04:07.775
B- B-B-Brickman's!

04:07.902 --> 04:10.310
B- B-Brickman's Powerboats!

04:10.446 --> 04:13.197
Get it?
Brickman's sells powerboats.

04:13.282 --> 04:16.035
We make the company mascot
a powerboat.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.076
What do you think?

04:18.163 --> 04:21.863
- I like it. Good work, Alan.
- Yes!

04:21.958 --> 04:23.867
Zachary, you're up.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.797
Ladies and gentlemen, Zachary!

04:26.923 --> 04:29.080
- I haven't taken these
to the focus group yet.

04:29.174 --> 04:31.416
I'm still working on that part.
I just wanted to let you know...

04:31.510 --> 04:34.261
- these are just preliminary sketches.
- Zach.

04:34.345 --> 04:36.468
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:36.598 --> 04:39.601
introducing the new mascot
for Hidy Ho Cookies...

04:39.728 --> 04:41.601
¶ Daa, daa-daa-daa ¶

04:41.729 --> 04:43.603
Zippy!

04:48.026 --> 04:52.820
What is it?

04:52.949 --> 04:55.571
- Zippy.
- What is Zippy?

04:55.660 --> 04:58.233
- He's a cookie man.
- He's a cookie man?

04:58.329 --> 05:00.238
What is that, uh,
on the ground behind him?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.242
Oh, that's a trail
of chocolate chips.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.492
See, wherever Zippy goes, he leaves
this magical trail of chocolate...

05:04.628 --> 05:06.502
- for all the boys and girls to...
- Magical?

05:06.630 --> 05:09.666
This looks like poop.
It looks like piles of poop.

05:09.799 --> 05:13.846
It looks like Zippy's walking around,
just crapping all over the place.

05:13.972 --> 05:15.631
- It looks like...
- Those are chocolate chips.

05:15.723 --> 05:18.131
- Emma, what do you think it looks like?
- Excrement.

05:18.267 --> 05:21.054
Zach, let's just say you're
about to take a big bite...

05:21.186 --> 05:23.060
of a juicy
chocolate chip cookie.

05:23.188 --> 05:26.061
What's the last image
you want floating through your head?

05:26.193 --> 05:28.268
- Excrement?
- Excrement. Right.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.270
Listen, I wanna go out
on a limb here.

05:30.363 --> 05:34.360
I'm gonna say, maybe we should
avoid all bowel-related items
with this particular product.

05:34.492 --> 05:36.486
- Just a hunch, you know?
- I'll work up something different.

05:36.621 --> 05:38.945
- All right. Thanks.
Nick Beam's office.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.159
- Oh, hi, Ann. It's your wife.
- Ooh, aah...

05:42.292 --> 05:45.162
Everybody out.
Big business deal.

05:45.295 --> 05:47.336
Hello.

05:47.465 --> 05:50.466
Now we're still on for tonight.
You stood me up twice, you know?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.674
It's a done deal. New York
Philharmonic. Last night in town.

05:52.803 --> 05:54.926
I'll be escorting
the sexiest woman in the world.

05:55.056 --> 05:57.047
- What about me?
- We'll bring ya.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.556
Oh, guess what?

05:59.687 --> 06:03.386
My sister left a message
on the machine. She's coming in
with her fiancé next Friday.

06:03.523 --> 06:05.397
- No. Oh, wow.
- Yeah!

06:05.525 --> 06:08.015
I finally get to meet the mysterious
queen of the Peace Corps.

06:08.152 --> 06:10.193
Yes, you do.
Hey, can you pick 'em up?

06:10.281 --> 06:13.863
Yeah, sure.
When is it?

06:13.992 --> 06:16.151
A week from today.

06:16.245 --> 06:19.577
I think it'll be around 10:30.
I'm not sure. I'll have to check.

06:19.706 --> 06:22.033
P.B. wants
to see you A.S.A.P.

06:22.168 --> 06:25.667
Sorry, honey, I gotta go. There's
an onslaught of initials coming at me.

06:25.755 --> 06:28.424
- Okay. Tell him hello.
- I will.

06:28.549 --> 06:31.715
- I hate you.
- Me too. Bye.

06:31.843 --> 06:34.515
Philip.

06:34.598 --> 06:36.554
Nick.

06:37.892 --> 06:40.430
Oh, oh!
Bungee jumping. Sunday.

06:40.562 --> 06:42.435
Nick!

06:42.563 --> 06:44.602
No, thanks, Phillip.

06:44.732 --> 06:47.521
- P.B.
- No, thanks, P.B.

06:47.612 --> 06:51.609
- Nick?
- P. B?

06:51.740 --> 06:54.195
Okay, okay.
Okay, forget it.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.868
- This guy is new.
- Yeah. What do you think?

06:57.956 --> 07:01.241
Uh, I think he likes me.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.542
Niroog, the fertility god.

07:04.629 --> 07:07.249
Boy, I like looking at this.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.215
Handmade in
the Palaeolithic period.

07:09.301 --> 07:12.800
Had to sacrifice
my Ides of March gold aureus in trade.

07:12.929 --> 07:17.389
Pity. But, uh,
I think worth it.

07:17.474 --> 07:19.597
So, which one of you
wanted to see me?

07:19.685 --> 07:23.102
- Charles McGinty is coming in at 5:00.
- The Charles McGinty?

07:23.190 --> 07:26.107
- "McGinty Crackers"
Charles McGinty? Fantastic.
- The very same.

07:26.193 --> 07:29.395
Anyway, I was supposed to have
dinner with McGinty tonight.
I'd love for you to stand in.

07:29.487 --> 07:32.407
Oh, no, uh, s...
Phillip, I promised Ann I would...

07:32.492 --> 07:35.991
Nick. Oh, Nick.
You gotta help me out here.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.445
I don't get this lucky every day.

07:38.581 --> 07:41.415
- Look, if this is about a woman...
- You're a pal.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.411
I gotta go.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.629
- It just needs to be...
- Guess who just called?

07:47.757 --> 07:50.462
Ann's divorce lawyer?

07:50.593 --> 07:52.632
McGinty's secretary.
He's rescheduling.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.422
- All right! Yes!
- Want me to get Ann on the line?

07:56.517 --> 08:00.514
No, I'm gonna try to beat her home.
I wanna surprise her.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.971
This is great, huh?

08:19.083 --> 08:23.459
- The wife again?
- No, I just met this incredible
brunette on the elevator.

08:23.545 --> 08:28.170
Well, I'm jealous. What would I have
to do to get flowers all the time?

08:28.257 --> 08:30.465
- You don't get flowers all the time?
- Nope.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.462
That's a crime.

10:40.855 --> 10:43.263
Phillip.

11:21.980 --> 11:25.019
Hey, asshole,
get outta the road!

11:34.744 --> 11:37.663
¶ Jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump ¶

11:37.749 --> 11:41.366
¶ I say fight
You're outta the corner
a day late, a dollar short ¶

11:41.502 --> 11:43.376
¶ Friday mornings
most people don't get ¶

11:53.139 --> 11:55.926
¶ Never mind being understood
Long as we understand ¶

11:56.059 --> 11:57.931

They bitch and bit ¶

12:00.523 --> 12:02.728
¶ All hours while
the crowds peepin' in ¶

12:02.816 --> 12:06.066

12:15.537 --> 12:18.574
Welcome to hell, bitch.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.574
Car, keys, wallet.
Now!

12:22.713 --> 12:25.547
D'you hear what I said?

12:25.631 --> 12:29.214
Okay. Now you listen,
and you listen good.

12:29.302 --> 12:33.215
This is a gun. Okay? Don't be
fuckin' around with no gun, white boy.

12:33.305 --> 12:35.465
Helen Keller,
I'm talkin' to you.

12:35.601 --> 12:38.554
I know you hear
what the fuck I'm sayin'.

12:40.647 --> 12:43.433
Boy, did you pick
the wrong guy on the wrong day.

12:43.566 --> 12:45.309
Oh!

12:48.406 --> 12:50.612
Oh, shit.

12:50.699 --> 12:53.949
Oh, you're trying to lock me...
U- U-Unlock the door.

12:55.578 --> 12:58.071
Stop, motherfucker!
Stop the car!

12:58.166 --> 13:00.953
Stop the car!

13:04.839 --> 13:07.080
Stop it now!

13:07.174 --> 13:10.509
You're driving on the sidewalk, man!
People got to walk there!

13:10.638 --> 13:13.638
Pull over, man!

13:13.765 --> 13:16.090
White boy, I said, "Pull over"!

13:24.359 --> 13:26.851
Yo, man, there's a truck.

13:26.987 --> 13:29.821
I said, yo, man,
there's a truck.

13:29.948 --> 13:32.820
Yo, man, there's a truck
right there. Stop!

13:43.712 --> 13:47.628
What about my wallet?
You wanted to rob me, didn't you?

13:47.717 --> 13:50.469
Yes. I distinctly remember
you wanting to rob me.

13:50.553 --> 13:52.463
Here's my wallet.
You want it?

13:52.556 --> 13:55.093
Here it is. Here.
Here. Right out there.

13:56.394 --> 13:57.972
What you doin', man?
That was money.

13:58.062 --> 14:01.644
- Oh, I'm sorry. I got
something else for you.

14:01.732 --> 14:04.934
I'm blind!
I can't see shit.

14:07.070 --> 14:12.314
The honeys dug my eyes.
The honeys loved my eyes.

14:50.575 --> 14:53.575
All right, you win, man. All right?
Is that what you wanna hear? You win.

15:01.002 --> 15:03.160
What the fuck?

15:03.295 --> 15:05.539
No, you ain't one
of them desert slashers, are you?

15:05.633 --> 15:10.259
Cut a person body up and leave
it out in the desert in little
tiny pieces and shit, huh?

15:10.387 --> 15:15.048
Oh, shit!
We are in the fucking desert.

15:15.141 --> 15:20.563
I'm in the car with a psycho, freaky,
Jason hack-killer motherfucker.

15:20.648 --> 15:23.934
Hey, please don't kill me,
freaky Jason.

15:24.068 --> 15:27.436
I said, please don't kill me,
freaky Jason.

15:29.992 --> 15:34.902
I done fucked around and caught
a ride with the wrong white boy!

15:55.393 --> 15:58.347
- Get out.
- With pleasure.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.349
"Sayo-fuckin'- nara," pal.

16:04.278 --> 16:08.109
Oh, I can't feel my ass.

16:08.198 --> 16:10.107
My ass done fell asleep.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.116
I didn't even know
an ass could fall asleep!

16:13.202 --> 16:15.991
It's all tingly and shit!

16:16.124 --> 16:18.993
Come on, man.
You can't leave me out here.

16:19.126 --> 16:22.874
Yo, man! You can't
just leave me out here.

16:50.535 --> 16:53.203
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.

16:53.328 --> 16:56.033
You drive me home, I'll forget
about this whole kidnapping shit.

16:56.164 --> 16:59.414
Oh, come on.

16:59.542 --> 17:01.535
Hello.
You tried to rob me.

17:03.965 --> 17:07.049
You had a gun to my head.

17:07.134 --> 17:09.589
Look, I told you
the gun wasn't loaded.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.257
You got yourself into this.

17:12.388 --> 17:16.223
You know what you are?
You're a bad person.
You're an armed robber.

17:16.310 --> 17:18.102
Don't expect me
to feel sorry for you.

17:18.229 --> 17:20.898
Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?

17:21.023 --> 17:23.596
- Yes.
- Is this man botherin' you?

17:23.733 --> 17:26.690
- Yes, he is.
- Oh, so you're just gonna come
right at the brother.

17:26.781 --> 17:28.689
Why don't you ask
if he's bothering me?

17:28.782 --> 17:31.985
Lady, for all you know,
I could be Denzel Washington.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.407
Take a good look.

17:34.495 --> 17:37.035
He could be some
celebrity stalker.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.331
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pay for this coffee now,

17:39.461 --> 17:41.452
'cause I've seen these things
escalate before.

17:41.587 --> 17:44.374
No problem.

17:44.465 --> 17:46.373
My wallet.

17:49.304 --> 17:51.592
Wow!

17:51.723 --> 17:55.721
Looks like the celebrity stalker
don't have a wallet.

17:55.810 --> 17:59.975
Oh, well, thank you.
I will get your change, sir.

18:03.985 --> 18:07.983
What?
You want me to thank you?

18:08.115 --> 18:09.988
So I owe you a buck.

18:10.116 --> 18:11.992
How was you goin' to get gas?

18:12.120 --> 18:14.113
You don't have no money,
no credit cards.

18:14.205 --> 18:16.909
No I.D.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.908
Shit, man.

18:19.001 --> 18:22.749
Okay. All right.

18:22.838 --> 18:27.750
You give me money for gas,
and I'II... take you back.

18:27.844 --> 18:30.002
I'm cool. I'm...
I'm straight.

18:30.138 --> 18:33.636
As a matter of fact,
I like it out here in the desert.

18:33.766 --> 18:36.010
You know, you get
all sweaty and shit.

18:36.145 --> 18:38.018
Just bubbling off your ass.

18:38.146 --> 18:40.637
Just... What?

18:40.774 --> 18:43.526
I just remembered.

18:43.651 --> 18:47.188
I have a spare credit card
in the side compartment.

18:58.335 --> 19:01.039
Uh-huh. Like hell!

19:01.170 --> 19:03.626
What's up?

19:03.715 --> 19:07.332
What's up, white boy?
W- W-What's up, huh?

19:07.426 --> 19:09.884
Come on, come on.
What ya got?

19:10.014 --> 19:13.180
Huh? Look at you.
You done fucked around and got dropped.

19:22.986 --> 19:24.978
Get the fuck outta here.

19:25.070 --> 19:28.356
- What?
- You hit like a ole girl, man.

19:28.491 --> 19:30.862
Get the fuck on out of here, man.
Go about your business.

19:34.122 --> 19:37.325
Motherf...

19:40.086 --> 19:44.379
What the hell is this,
your merry-go-round move?

19:52.891 --> 19:55.677
Yo, I understand.

20:04.153 --> 20:06.061
Aha!

20:15.540 --> 20:17.413
Thank you.

20:29.178 --> 20:32.217
Hey. Oh, shit.

20:33.852 --> 20:37.896
I didn't know it was expired.
I never use it.

20:41.858 --> 20:43.769
So why are you out here?

20:43.862 --> 20:46.435
- What do you care?
- I'm curious.

20:46.531 --> 20:48.440
I'm a student
of human nature.

20:48.533 --> 20:51.071
You're a freak
of human nature.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.733
That's all right.
I forgive you.

20:53.829 --> 20:56.951
It's clear you have woman problems.

20:57.084 --> 20:58.957
You're way off base.

20:59.085 --> 21:01.790
- I'm off base?
- Yeah. Way off base.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.121
- She mess around on you?
- Look.

21:04.256 --> 21:07.924
Even if I wanted to talk
about it... which I don't...
it wouldn't be with you.

21:08.012 --> 21:10.134
You give her some nastiness?

21:10.222 --> 21:12.678
- I know you gave her
some serious nastiness.
- Just forget it.

21:12.808 --> 21:15.179
What about him?
Did you fuck him up?

21:15.310 --> 21:18.182
Did you whoop his ass?

21:18.315 --> 21:20.805
I bet you hit that motherfucker
with a bat, didn't ya?

21:20.900 --> 21:23.356
Kling! Pow!
Fucked his ass up, didn't ya?

21:23.486 --> 21:26.652
No, wait a minute.
You capped him.

21:26.738 --> 21:28.648
You capped that motherfucker,
didn't you?

21:28.740 --> 21:30.652
That's why you out here
in the desert, ain't ya?

21:30.745 --> 21:33.780
Look. I didn't shoot him. I didn't
say anything to my wife. I just left.

21:33.872 --> 21:35.781
- What do you mean, you just left?
- Just left.

21:35.874 --> 21:38.909
I- I saw them doing...
you know,

21:39.043 --> 21:43.374
and I... walked away.

21:44.550 --> 21:47.171
What a pussy.

21:47.261 --> 21:51.305
No wonder your woman
is sneaking behind your back, man.

21:51.389 --> 21:55.341
Know what your problem is? You don't
have the respect of your woman, man.

21:55.479 --> 21:57.850
That's what it is.
Me, I got all that.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.938
I go home, my dinner's
on the table.

22:00.066 --> 22:02.105
Bam! I don't wanna
hear shit, woman.

22:02.234 --> 22:04.644
And if I want lovin'...
if I'm in the mood... I get that too.

22:04.738 --> 22:07.359
You're so full of shit.
What would you have done?

22:07.449 --> 22:10.236
I'd have went back to that house and
pulled a Terminator on the front door.

22:10.368 --> 22:13.867
Boom, boom, boom! Who the fuck do you
think you're playin' with, woman?

22:13.954 --> 22:17.741
Who do you think I am, some fruity pie?
I ain't no fruity pie.

22:17.877 --> 22:20.367
I'm... I'm Nick Beam.

22:20.462 --> 22:22.372
That's what I told her.
I'm Nick Beam.

22:22.464 --> 22:26.711
And Nick Beam ain't puttin' up
with that bullshit.

22:26.843 --> 22:30.012
She'd have been crying, you know?
"Oh, Nick, please take me back.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.220
Please, please, Nick.
It was only one time. "

22:32.308 --> 22:34.051
I'm gonna "one time" your ass.

22:34.185 --> 22:38.264
Nick Beam is the master of his fate,
the ruler of his destiny.

22:38.397 --> 22:40.273
So if you wanna cry
on somebody's shoulder,

22:40.401 --> 22:42.274
why don't you cry
on Superdick?

22:42.402 --> 22:44.893
As for Nick Beam,
I'm fit, lit,

22:45.030 --> 22:47.900
and I damn sure
ain't takin' no shit.

22:48.032 --> 22:52.862
So you can get
the fuck out.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.789
That's what I'd
'a told the bitch.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.581
That's what I told the bitch.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.542
What the...

23:05.635 --> 23:09.467
Hey, hold it. Hold it.
Break it up. Break it up.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.926
Should I pay cash, or do you
wanna use your credit card?

23:39.671 --> 23:43.122
Ah, fu... Oh... Ah...
Oh, shit.

23:43.216 --> 23:45.623
Put the money in the bag.

23:45.718 --> 23:47.959
Put the money
in the fuckin' bag!

23:48.053 --> 23:51.305
- Shit.
- Let's go!

23:55.604 --> 23:58.176
Shit.

23:58.314 --> 24:00.141
You weren't gonna leave
without me, were you?

24:00.274 --> 24:03.479
- What do you think you're doing?
- There's a special they got goin'.

24:03.612 --> 24:07.195
You get a free stack of cash
with every fill-up. Some luck, huh?

24:07.324 --> 24:09.648
How stupid can you be?

24:09.784 --> 24:11.658
- We better get out of here.
- You take that money back.

24:11.744 --> 24:14.154
- I'm serious, man.
We better get goin'.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.828
We'll get going as soon as you
bring back that money.

24:16.959 --> 24:20.328
- I'm not bullshittin'! Move out!
- I'm not going anywhere until...

24:20.463 --> 24:22.870
Here we go.

24:23.006 --> 24:26.709
¶¶

24:29.639 --> 24:31.513
Why? Why?

24:31.641 --> 24:34.511
- Why?
- I didn't have any money, man.

24:34.602 --> 24:38.517
- Oh, you had money.
- No. That five dollars
I gave the waitress was it.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.564
What the...

24:40.692 --> 24:43.859
Oh, great.
Buford's come to kill us.

24:49.578 --> 24:52.246
- Persistent hillbilly motherfucker.
- He has every right to be.

24:52.371 --> 24:55.491
You robbed him... at gunpoint.
You dick!

24:55.583 --> 24:59.997
Hey, hey, you're the one who threw
the wallet out the fuckin' window.

25:00.089 --> 25:01.997
Smart.

25:02.090 --> 25:04.498
Great.

25:06.261 --> 25:08.929
- ¶¶
- Oh, shit.

25:14.102 --> 25:17.436
- All right, man. What you doin'?
- Come on, asshole.

25:19.399 --> 25:23.778
Well, would you look
at these crazy sons o' bitches?

25:23.905 --> 25:26.395
Oh, shit. We gonna die.
Pull off the fuckin' road.

25:26.532 --> 25:29.201
Pull off the fuckin' road!

25:29.285 --> 25:31.953
Oh, shit!

25:32.079 --> 25:35.035
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

25:57.357 --> 25:59.646
Hey, Earl.

26:10.829 --> 26:12.702
Oh, sh...

26:12.831 --> 26:16.282
I'm alive!
You alive!

26:16.418 --> 26:19.287
How'd you know that hillbilly
was gonna turn first?

26:19.378 --> 26:21.456
You did know he was gonna
turn first, didn't ya?

26:21.591 --> 26:24.710
You know what?

26:24.843 --> 26:28.093
It don't even matter.
I'm alive!

26:28.180 --> 26:30.302
You alive, man!

26:42.194 --> 26:44.069
- Get out!
- What?

26:44.198 --> 26:46.072
Get out!

26:50.036 --> 26:52.443
It's not even loaded, remember?

26:55.040 --> 26:57.000
What are you even thinking
when you do something like that?

26:57.086 --> 26:59.790
- You think you're never
gonna get caught?
- We didn't get caught.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.501
That's not the point.
It's beetleheaded.

27:02.633 --> 27:04.671
It's only a matter of time
before you do get caught.

27:04.759 --> 27:06.835
What is "beetleheaded"?

27:06.972 --> 27:09.178
It's a synonym for "stupid. "

27:09.307 --> 27:14.514
Oh. Well, here's a synonym
for "procreation. " Fuck you!

27:14.645 --> 27:16.518
It's easy for you
to point the finger...

27:16.646 --> 27:18.558
when you're sittin' on your rich ass
in a big fuckin' house.

27:18.692 --> 27:20.815
- I'm not rich.
- Oh, yeah?

27:20.903 --> 27:23.571
- How big's your TV?
- What?

27:23.696 --> 27:25.404
- I say, how big's your TV?
- Fifty-inch.

27:25.532 --> 27:29.030
- Get in the car.
- Oh, please. Let's not
make this a social issue.

27:29.159 --> 27:32.862
The point is that even if
you wanted to rob a place,
there are smarter ways to do it.

27:32.957 --> 27:36.705
- Enlighten me.
- A mask. Wear a mask.

27:36.835 --> 27:38.993
You see, the police have this thing
called a "line-up,"

27:39.086 --> 27:42.458
and if someone recognizes you,
you go to jail!

27:42.592 --> 27:45.462
Oh, how about this for a novel idea?
Case the place first.

27:45.594 --> 27:49.509
Find out if there's
a security camera or a hidden alarm.

27:49.598 --> 27:52.385
Then again, why even rob
a convenience store?

27:52.517 --> 27:54.726
How much money could you possibly get?
Two, three hundred dollars?

27:54.855 --> 27:57.096
Then what? You're set
for two days! Wow!

27:57.231 --> 28:00.186
- What do you know, lanky?
- I know you go for the big score.

28:00.276 --> 28:02.103
One robbery, you're set.

28:02.236 --> 28:05.607
News flash, big slim.

28:05.741 --> 28:07.734
People with big money,
they protect it.

28:07.869 --> 28:10.869
So you do a little research.
Take Quality Design Group,
where I work.

28:10.954 --> 28:13.492
My boss keeps a ton of cash
in his vault.

28:13.624 --> 28:16.745
At night, there's only two guards
and a personal security system.

28:16.878 --> 28:19.831
Now, in this case,
I happen to even know the code.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.837
But even if I didn't, I...

28:25.885 --> 28:28.092
What?

28:31.351 --> 28:33.260
I got a booger in my nose?

28:35.230 --> 28:37.767
What?

28:37.898 --> 28:40.225
Diversify.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.727
You can't trust banks, Nick.

28:42.822 --> 28:47.400
The entire system
could crumble at any second.

28:47.492 --> 28:51.240
That bastard's so heavily leveraged,
it would wipe him out.

28:51.329 --> 28:55.078
Wait a minute.
Am I hearing you right?

28:55.167 --> 28:58.252
Mr "High and Mighty"
is gonna rob his boss?

29:01.172 --> 29:04.460
You hear that,
gila monsters?

29:04.595 --> 29:07.299
Old Nick Beam here
is gonna rob his boss!

29:07.388 --> 29:11.766
I say, do you hear that,
gila monsters?

29:11.851 --> 29:15.802
You know what, Nick? Your wife
really messed your head up bad, man.

29:18.483 --> 29:20.606
You're serious?

29:23.113 --> 29:25.021
How much he got?

29:25.156 --> 29:28.527
Only the bulk
of his personal assets.

29:28.661 --> 29:30.819
Six, seven hundred thousand.

29:30.955 --> 29:32.947
You what?

29:33.040 --> 29:37.203
- Hey, you gonna need some help.
- Oh, no, this has
nothing to do with you.

29:37.335 --> 29:41.381
Hey, I was present at the time
of creative inspiration,

29:41.507 --> 29:43.880
which entitles me
to partial ownership...

29:44.010 --> 29:46.003
in this criminalistic endeavour.

29:46.137 --> 29:48.544
Get out.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.849
Maybe I'll just call
Quality Design Group when we get back.

29:53.645 --> 29:56.480
I want half.

29:58.317 --> 30:01.687
We're gonna bury
this asshole.

30:01.779 --> 30:03.689
Sure, you're right.

30:12.831 --> 30:15.917
¶ If you ever plan ¶

30:16.043 --> 30:17.917
¶ To motor West ¶

30:20.048 --> 30:23.416
¶ Travel my way
Take the highway ¶

30:23.550 --> 30:26.174

30:52.081 --> 30:54.916
¶ More than 2,000 miles ¶¶

30:57.836 --> 31:01.587
- Highway shooters?
- One black, one white. You tell me?

31:01.717 --> 31:03.923
You were there,
and they got away?

31:04.010 --> 31:07.794
They were driving a 1996 Yukon.

31:07.931 --> 31:11.097
Licence?

31:11.183 --> 31:14.435
You know, if I had a licence number,
Bart, I wouldn't be standing here...

31:14.521 --> 31:17.095
- eating large quantities
of shit, now, would I?
- No, sir.

31:17.191 --> 31:21.270
Monitor calls on both sides
of the border. Fax that photo
to every precinct on the planet.

31:21.361 --> 31:23.771
There's so much as a sneeze
out there,

31:23.865 --> 31:26.356
I wanna feel the mist.

31:38.213 --> 31:41.629
¶ I hear a voice ¶

31:41.716 --> 31:44.123
- Give me all your money and a Yoo Hoo.
- The money's all locked up.

31:48.183 --> 31:50.554
That'll be 79 cents, please.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.352
¶ I said
Come on, little prisoner ¶

31:55.480 --> 31:58.151
¶ I got something to say ¶¶

32:02.029 --> 32:06.027
¶¶

32:09.036 --> 32:11.659
Something stinks, man.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.663
You sure you ain't got
a gas leak?

32:13.792 --> 32:15.998
It's my shoes.

32:16.127 --> 32:18.499
Your shoes?

32:21.134 --> 32:23.376
You ever heard
of Dr Scholl's?

32:23.511 --> 32:26.844
I spilled some gas on my shoes
at the gas station.

32:26.930 --> 32:29.682
You know, the one you robbed.

32:31.351 --> 32:34.354
- So you got a camcorder up in here.
- What are you doing?

32:34.481 --> 32:36.603
I'm just checkin' it out, man.

32:36.732 --> 32:38.855
- Put it down.
- I ain't gonna break it, man.

32:38.985 --> 32:42.567
Just let me check it out.
Just let me see.

32:44.239 --> 32:46.151
Yo, this is your wife?

32:46.243 --> 32:50.703
Man, I see why you were upset.

32:50.830 --> 32:54.614
Not bad, Nick.
Not bad, Nick.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.828
I mean, you know,
for a cheatin' bitch.

32:56.921 --> 32:59.376
Look, don't you call her that.

32:59.464 --> 33:01.753
You don't know her.
Don't call her that.

33:01.884 --> 33:04.800
Okay. No disrespect.
Okay?

33:06.304 --> 33:08.215
What should I call her?

33:08.350 --> 33:11.884
Monogamously challenged?

33:12.019 --> 33:13.977
God.

33:14.105 --> 33:16.062
I'm just fuckin'
with you, man.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.265
You know, this is an all right camera
for a regular eight.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.736
- It's the best on the market.
- Let me explain something to you.

33:21.864 --> 33:25.279
If you ain't got digital,
you ain't got shit.

33:25.408 --> 33:28.408
This has only got
one C.C.D. chip.

33:28.494 --> 33:30.868
Broadcast has three, Nick.

33:30.957 --> 33:35.084
Don't look at me like that.
What, are you surprised I know shit?

33:35.169 --> 33:38.585
The guy that sold me that camera
just set up our computer network.

33:38.714 --> 33:42.582
- Windows NT?
- No. Just Windows.

33:42.719 --> 33:45.423
- Man, get out of here with that shit.
- Look, here's a nutty idea.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.594
If you actually know
something about this stuff,

33:47.723 --> 33:49.965
why not use that knowledge
and get a job?

33:50.101 --> 33:52.057
Take a good look at me.

33:52.144 --> 33:55.063
- I'm not exactly the corporate colour.
- That's ridiculous.

33:55.149 --> 33:58.932
- If you wanted a job,
you could have one.
- There's a spider on your head.

33:59.069 --> 34:02.734
- What?
- There's a spider on your head.

34:02.822 --> 34:06.738
Look, I am sorry. I am not up on
all this jive-talkin', homeboy lingo.

34:06.828 --> 34:09.994
What's that supposed to mean,
there's a spider on your head?

34:10.121 --> 34:14.286
It means: There's a spider
on your motherfuckin' head, man.

34:14.376 --> 34:17.127
Well, get it off!
Get it off, get it off!

34:17.212 --> 34:19.835
- I ain't touchin' that shit.
- Get it off!

34:19.966 --> 34:21.839
Get it off, get it off,
get if off, get if off!

34:21.967 --> 34:26.463
- Get it off!
- Yo, that's a big fuckin' spider, man.

34:26.554 --> 34:28.297
Oh, shit!

34:31.520 --> 34:34.141
¶¶

34:34.230 --> 34:36.768
- ¶¶
- Nick, it's just a spider.

34:36.858 --> 34:39.609
¶ I'm a scat man ¶

34:39.693 --> 34:43.313
No, no. Now don't go crazy.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.652
- Yeah, you go, boy.
- ¶ I'm a scat man ¶

34:49.121 --> 34:52.491
Hold on, let me focus.
Let me focus on this shit.

34:52.583 --> 34:56.166
¶ I'm a scat man ¶

34:56.253 --> 34:59.504
- Oh, shit.
- ¶¶

35:07.265 --> 35:10.183
You got the hot foot!
Yo, Nick!

35:10.268 --> 35:14.514
Get on the good foot.
Get on...

35:16.651 --> 35:20.695
Aw, got it!

35:37.170 --> 35:39.046
¶ I'm a scat man ¶

35:39.174 --> 35:42.044
¶¶

35:44.679 --> 35:47.217
¶ I'm a scat man ¶

35:47.349 --> 35:49.221
¶¶

35:54.523 --> 35:57.393
¶¶

36:07.787 --> 36:10.952
I gotta make a call.
You pump.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.702
- Give me the gun.
- What?

36:13.794 --> 36:15.917
Gimme the gun.

36:18.089 --> 36:20.129
Man, I wasn't gonna
rob the place, man.

36:20.258 --> 36:22.713
Then you won't need this.

36:22.801 --> 36:24.711
Then you won't need this.

36:35.356 --> 36:37.267
You must be really fast.

36:40.029 --> 36:42.105
Twenty dollars
on pump number 15...

36:42.198 --> 36:45.614
and a sour fruity twist.

36:48.537 --> 36:51.907
- You a cop?
- No.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.751
You bastards have tried this
too many times!

36:54.836 --> 36:56.745
- Oh, listen...
- Shut up!

36:56.838 --> 36:59.506
- I wasn't gonna...
- Shut up.

37:03.887 --> 37:07.802
County Sheriff's Station.

37:07.891 --> 37:10.262
Hello, hello.

37:10.351 --> 37:12.476
- Uh...
- Yes, may I help you?

37:12.605 --> 37:16.056
That show, Cops,

37:16.192 --> 37:18.480
I love it.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.106
Have you ever had
a really bad day?

37:23.114 --> 37:25.026
I'm havin' one right now.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.911
Now, look, baby,
I told you I'll be home later.

37:28.037 --> 37:32.082
Now, this guy say he got a job
for me payin' big money.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.329
Okay, now, please, don't argue with me.
Not now. All right?

37:35.421 --> 37:37.829
I'll see you later. Okay.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.009
Oh, oh. Oh.

37:48.143 --> 37:52.519
Now all I want's $20 on pump number 15
and a sour fruity twist.

37:52.646 --> 37:55.019
- Now is that too much to ask?
- No, sir.

37:55.107 --> 37:59.320
- Do you mind if I take your gun?
- No, sir.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.692
Would you please rip the phone cord
out of the wall?

38:01.781 --> 38:06.242
- What?
- Would you rip the phone cord
out of the wall, please?

38:06.369 --> 38:08.242
Thank you.

38:08.370 --> 38:12.417
This is for the phone and for the gun
and for the sour fruity twist.

38:12.543 --> 38:17.454
And $20 on pump number 15.
Go on.

38:17.589 --> 38:20.589
- Thank you for your patience.
- Yes, sir.

38:24.722 --> 38:26.595
Let me get this straight.

38:26.724 --> 38:29.559
It's all right for you to rob a place,
but it ain't all right for me?

38:29.685 --> 38:31.558
I didn't rob him.

38:31.686 --> 38:34.808
Well, you got a funny way
of not robbin' a motherfucker.

38:34.942 --> 38:37.396
Nick, let's get out of here, man,
before he calls the cops.

38:37.527 --> 38:39.401
- He's not gonna call the cops.
- How do you know?

38:39.529 --> 38:42.482
I had him rip the phone cord
out of the wall.

38:42.614 --> 38:45.487
Oh, shoot.
That's pretty good.

38:45.620 --> 38:48.157
And you got his gun?

38:48.288 --> 38:51.787
Not bad, Nicholas.
Not bad.

39:04.305 --> 39:08.218
¶¶

39:08.310 --> 39:11.725
¶¶

39:28.372 --> 39:30.613
Charlie, this shit's
depressing the shit out of me.

39:30.748 --> 39:33.420
- It's makin' me sad.
- What?

39:33.503 --> 39:35.708
Oh, come on, man.
This shit is the shit.

39:35.838 --> 39:37.961
- This is the shit.
It's supposed to make you sad.
- It's grim.

39:38.090 --> 39:40.047
Oh, man, come on.
This is the shit.

39:40.176 --> 39:44.471
This shit is the shit.
This is the hellified love music.

39:44.556 --> 39:46.762
I'm in bad shape over here.

39:46.849 --> 39:50.633
You know, maybe I can tune you in...
to a nice A.M. station...

39:50.770 --> 39:52.809
and get you some Donny Osmond.

39:55.568 --> 39:59.481
- Charlie, what's this? Slow down.
- Get the fuck out of here.

39:59.613 --> 40:02.151
Pull over and turn
the headlights off.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.663
Yo, man, you could've
gotten me a piece of liquorice.

40:16.796 --> 40:19.171
- It's sour.
- So.

40:19.301 --> 40:21.542
Still could've gotten me a piece.

40:21.677 --> 40:24.347
- I didn't think of it.
- Oh, you didn't think of it.

40:24.430 --> 40:27.051
Just selfish, man.
Guess that's the world.

40:27.182 --> 40:30.684
- You know? You just...
You just selfish.
- Here.

40:48.581 --> 40:50.453
Damn.

40:50.582 --> 40:55.162
I swear, white people must got
totally different taste buds, man.

40:55.255 --> 40:57.580
That's a very racist thing to say.

40:57.715 --> 41:00.835
Oh, yeah? Good.

41:05.349 --> 41:07.756
What the f...

41:08.935 --> 41:11.605
Whoa, they're rammin' us.

41:11.730 --> 41:15.394
Thanks for the late-breakin' news.
Step on the gas, Nick!

41:15.483 --> 41:17.727
I hate new cars.

41:17.862 --> 41:20.233
Whoa!

41:25.326 --> 41:28.365
Look at his face, man.

41:34.921 --> 41:37.707
Our turf, baby.

42:05.537 --> 42:07.493
They don't look like cops.

42:07.622 --> 42:10.457
Definitely not cops.

42:10.541 --> 42:13.292
Get out of the car.

42:15.214 --> 42:17.123
There you go.

42:17.216 --> 42:20.169
All right, motherfuckers,
back the fuck off!

42:25.389 --> 42:28.476
Oh, shit.
It's cool.

42:30.771 --> 42:33.096
Oh, yeah, I'm cool.
We cool.

42:33.190 --> 42:35.098
I was just fuckin'
with y'all, man.

42:35.191 --> 42:37.100
Hey, what's up?
Y'all live around here?

42:37.193 --> 42:40.481
Bring your ass
around the front of the car.

42:40.615 --> 42:44.149
Come on, baby,
Come on, baby. There you go.

42:44.243 --> 42:46.319
There you go.

42:46.454 --> 42:49.824
- All right. Okay. Oh, shit.
- Uh-huh. Watch your feet.

42:49.917 --> 42:52.870
Come on, rubber legs. Let's go.
Watch where you're walkin'.

42:53.002 --> 42:55.707
Watch your feet.
There you go, baby.

42:55.839 --> 42:58.590
Perhaps you two haven't heard
that my partner and I here...

42:58.716 --> 43:01.885
own the rights to all violent crime
on this particular stretch of highway.

43:02.013 --> 43:06.010
And we don't take kindly to any
unauthorized criminal activities.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.970
You don't understand.
We were...

43:09.061 --> 43:11.978
- Oh, shit.
- That's my car.

43:12.063 --> 43:14.058
- Can I have your attention, please?
- Yeah.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.682
I bet you used to sell
more Girl Scout cookies...

43:16.819 --> 43:18.859
than any other member of
the whole troop, didn't ya?

43:18.988 --> 43:20.862
What were you calling
yourself back then?

43:20.990 --> 43:23.397
Yolanda, you little bitch?

43:23.533 --> 43:25.409
Cynthia? Susan?
What was it? I can't remember.

43:25.538 --> 43:27.695
- Guys, I will be gentle.
Don't even worry about it.
- Huh?

43:27.831 --> 43:30.867
Now... Now, don't even worry.

43:31.001 --> 43:33.491
Uh-huh.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.422
I have these.

43:37.550 --> 43:39.756
Oh, now that's not
gonna be enough.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.886
Where'd you put your booty?

43:50.188 --> 43:52.061
Now I've done it.

43:52.189 --> 43:55.440
I finally found someone
I like less than you.

43:55.568 --> 43:57.441
Shit. That's
a fancy case, friend.

43:59.196 --> 44:02.068
You know, when a sweet-mouthed girl
like you has a fancy case like this,

44:02.200 --> 44:05.901
a man gets to thinkin'...
where's the wallet?

44:06.037 --> 44:09.287
That's it.
We're dead, man.

44:09.415 --> 44:11.208
I'm gonna need that wallet, Alice.

44:11.294 --> 44:15.421
Where's that big, fat wallet?
Give it to me.

44:15.547 --> 44:18.252
Give me your fuckin' wallet,
you little bitch.

44:20.843 --> 44:23.134
- You know what?
- Nick, Nick, what you doin'?

44:23.265 --> 44:25.422
I'm sure you're
a really scary guy.

44:25.558 --> 44:28.310
I'm sure that, normally,
people just quiver...

44:28.436 --> 44:30.310
at the very sound of your voice.

44:30.438 --> 44:32.476
But, you see, I can't
see that right now.

44:32.606 --> 44:34.933
I- I-I just see...

44:35.027 --> 44:37.778
a weak, desperate little man...

44:37.862 --> 44:40.780
that probably grew up
torturing little animals.

44:40.907 --> 44:42.899
Some puny, little
uncoordinated...

44:42.992 --> 44:47.455
can't-make-the-football-team-
so-I’ll-pick-on-third-graders-
and-steal-their-lunch-money...

44:47.540 --> 44:50.113
punk, jerk-off, bully...

44:50.250 --> 44:52.576
that one day wakes up
and realizes he's nothing.

44:52.669 --> 44:56.916
Just a sad, pathetic, useless,
illiterate piece of inbred shit.

44:57.006 --> 45:01.468
I just want you to know,
I totally disagree.

45:09.188 --> 45:11.097
Time to die.

45:11.190 --> 45:13.597
That just makes you
my best friend.

45:15.735 --> 45:18.486
All right, drop the fuckin' gun.

45:18.612 --> 45:21.651
Drop the fuckin' gun!

45:21.742 --> 45:23.651
Give me this, motherfucker.

45:23.744 --> 45:26.661
Now back the fuck up
before I kick in your bitch-ass chin.

45:26.747 --> 45:30.115
Back the fuck up!
I said, back the fuck up!

45:30.208 --> 45:33.164
Didn't I say, back the fuck up?
Everybody, back the fuck up.

45:33.296 --> 45:36.166
Oh!

45:37.717 --> 45:40.671
Shit.

45:40.803 --> 45:44.387
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry, Nick.

45:44.516 --> 45:47.766
- Put down the gun.
- Shut up.

45:47.894 --> 45:51.559
- You shot me.
- I said, I'm sorry, man.
I- I didn't mean it.

45:51.690 --> 45:54.061
The gun just went off.

45:54.191 --> 45:56.150
You know, I have that
same trouble in bed.

45:56.237 --> 45:59.486
Well, rarely.
Every once in a great while.

45:59.573 --> 46:03.024
- Put down that gun, you idiot.
- Would you shut up? I'm shot here.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.828
You shut the fuck up.
Who the hell do you think you are?

46:05.912 --> 46:08.405
- You shut the fuck up!
You shut the fuck up!
- Look at yourself.

46:08.541 --> 46:10.664
- Man, you shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

46:10.751 --> 46:14.203
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Put that fucking gun down
before you take a toe hit.

46:14.338 --> 46:17.837
- You shut the fuck up!
- I don't give a shit!
- Shut the fuck up!

46:17.924 --> 46:20.880
- Shut the fuck up, man!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, hey!

46:21.013 --> 46:24.179
Hey! Everybody,
shut the fuck up!

46:24.265 --> 46:26.673
Now, everybody,
shut the fuck up!

46:26.768 --> 46:28.594
Especially you.
Shut the fuck up.

46:28.727 --> 46:31.102
You like Girl Scout cookies?
Come here. Come here.

46:31.232 --> 46:33.225
You want cookie?
Here's a cookie.

46:33.359 --> 46:36.858
Now back the fuck up like I done
told you two dumb-ass mother...

46:36.945 --> 46:39.270
Back up, back up.

46:43.745 --> 46:47.528
Get in the car, Nick!
Look at you now.

46:49.750 --> 46:51.576
That's good.

46:51.710 --> 46:55.959
Bye, cowboys!

47:07.687 --> 47:10.722
Nick.

47:10.814 --> 47:13.056
Why the hell you start up
with that guy, man?

47:13.150 --> 47:20.106
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry.

47:20.199 --> 47:24.660
You don't say you're sorry
when you shoot someone.

47:24.787 --> 47:27.158
You say you're sorry
when you step on someone's toe,

47:27.289 --> 47:30.292
or you accidentally
break their glasses,

47:30.377 --> 47:32.285
or you fart
while they're eating.

47:32.378 --> 47:34.620
You don't say you're sorry
when you shoot someone.

47:34.756 --> 47:37.294
Shit.

47:37.383 --> 47:41.003
Oh, my God. It's going numb.
It's going numb. It's going numb.

47:41.138 --> 47:43.973
What?

47:44.057 --> 47:46.513
Shit.

47:53.693 --> 47:56.148
Oh, my God!

47:56.237 --> 47:58.988
Nick, that's the most
hideous thing I ever seen.

47:59.115 --> 48:02.317
Hey, yo, man, you know,
maybe if you wrap your arm in ice,

48:02.409 --> 48:05.116
they can reattach it.

48:08.458 --> 48:11.163
That's funny, man.

48:11.294 --> 48:14.164
- That's a baby gash.
- Shut up.

48:14.296 --> 48:16.172
But it's a baby gash.

48:16.300 --> 48:18.837
It could've been a lot worse.
It could've been a lot worse.

48:18.927 --> 48:21.881
- It could've been, but it wasn't.
- What are you thinking, shooting?

48:22.014 --> 48:23.887
Look, just calm down,
all right?

48:24.015 --> 48:27.635
You're gonna upset your wound.

48:48.749 --> 48:50.744
Yeah. Do you folks
want a lift somewhere?

48:50.878 --> 48:52.670
- Where you from?
- London.

48:52.755 --> 48:54.663
- Me too!
- Really?

48:54.756 --> 48:56.215
- Yeah!
- That's terrific.

48:56.341 --> 49:00.753
Hop in me car. Let's go then.
Come on. Jump in. Let's go.

49:00.887 --> 49:04.589
- Oh, this is great.
- Hey, would you
scoot over a smidgen?

49:06.727 --> 49:10.227
Sorry about that.
Cheers, mate.

49:13.485 --> 49:16.190
Nick Beam.

49:16.280 --> 49:19.944
- Where we headed?
- L.A.

49:21.868 --> 49:24.572
City of Angels.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.914
So where you plan
on stayin' tonight?

49:36.048 --> 49:39.135
- I'll just sleep in the car.
- Yeah, right.

49:39.262 --> 49:41.301
You can stay at my place, man.

49:41.430 --> 49:45.593
Thanks.
Well, just for the night.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.925
What? Did you think
I was asking you to move in?

49:48.061 --> 49:50.732
- No, I was just sayin'...
- Please, Mr Beam.

49:50.816 --> 49:54.184
- Stay with me forever.
- Just shut up.

49:54.318 --> 49:58.102
- Mr Beam.
- Shut up.

49:58.238 --> 50:00.992
- Mr Beam, Mr Beam, Mr Beam.
- You know how to shut up?

50:01.118 --> 50:02.991
- Mr Beam.
- Is it in your vocabulary?

50:03.119 --> 50:05.445
- Stay with me forever, Mr Beam.
- Do you ever shut up?

50:05.539 --> 50:08.290
Will you stay with me forever,
Mr Beam?

50:30.690 --> 50:31.969
Look here.

50:32.065 --> 50:35.816
When you meet my wife, she don't know
nothin' about my sideline gig.

50:35.946 --> 50:37.819
You mean she doesn't know
you're a thief?

50:37.947 --> 50:39.821
I'm not a thief, okay?

50:39.950 --> 50:43.153
I just dabble
in future used goods.

50:43.286 --> 50:47.155
- Well, what does she think
you do all day?
- Look for work, man.

50:49.793 --> 50:53.412
Maybe if you did look for work,
you wouldn't have to steal.

50:53.547 --> 50:56.666
Don't judge me.

51:04.892 --> 51:06.802
You stepped on my shoe.

51:06.893 --> 51:09.301
I don't usually
get in this late.

51:10.900 --> 51:14.315
Baby, am I glad to see you.

51:14.402 --> 51:18.695
No, no, no. No, talk to me.
Explain this to me now.

51:18.781 --> 51:22.152
I got mugged.

51:22.245 --> 51:24.913
- Okay, I didn't get mugged.
- I got mugged.

51:25.038 --> 51:29.831
- I got mugged. He got beat up.
- Thank...

51:29.919 --> 51:32.456
Remember how I was tellin' you
I had a job interview?

51:32.587 --> 51:34.463
Baby, that's him.
He right there.

51:34.591 --> 51:37.544
That's the player right there.

51:37.635 --> 51:43.340
My name's Nick. Nick Beam.
Nice to meet you.

51:43.432 --> 51:45.676
When are you gonna stop
gettin' into trouble, Terrance?

51:45.769 --> 51:48.224
- Terrance?
- "T."

51:48.313 --> 51:51.516
Okay? My friends call me "T."
You can kiss my ass. Boo!

51:51.608 --> 51:54.561
- Okay, Terrance.
- Oh, Mama.

51:54.652 --> 51:58.403
Please go on
back to bed, Mama.

51:58.533 --> 52:01.403
What kind of man stays out
till 2:30 in the morning,

52:01.535 --> 52:03.444
then comes back lookin'
like a bruised turd?

52:03.579 --> 52:06.199
- Mama, I ain't...
- Don't you talk back.

52:06.289 --> 52:09.043
Don't talk back to your mother.

52:09.127 --> 52:12.246
W... What... What'd I do?

52:12.338 --> 52:14.247
You got that slap
'cause you with him.

52:14.382 --> 52:17.714
- And I know you're part of
whatever badness he's into.
- Mama, enough.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.923
You got some explainin'
to do in the morning, Mr Gentleman.

52:21.056 --> 52:24.056
- Now you think on that.
- Oof.

52:28.813 --> 52:32.599
Why do you keep on
smackin' me, Mama?

52:34.695 --> 52:37.102
Okay.

52:37.197 --> 52:39.948
Shh.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.606
No, go ahead. Go ahead.

52:42.702 --> 52:44.613
- Okay.
- Oh.

52:46.958 --> 52:49.164
Now you come here.

52:49.293 --> 52:51.962
Mama didn't have to
smack me three times.

52:56.510 --> 52:59.131
- We gotta move out of here.
- I know.

52:59.220 --> 53:01.130
I know.

53:02.557 --> 53:04.465
I heard gunshots.

53:04.558 --> 53:06.470
Hey there.

53:06.604 --> 53:09.474
Hey, what you doing
up this late, huh?

53:09.606 --> 53:12.442
Huh? What's up?
What are you doing up this late?

53:12.526 --> 53:15.811
Oh, honey,
we woke you.

53:15.904 --> 53:18.313
Now look, don't worry.
Give Daddy a kiss.

53:18.408 --> 53:21.194
Don't worry. I ain't gonna
let nothin' happen to y'all.

53:21.327 --> 53:23.699
- You know that, right?
- What happened to your face?

53:23.829 --> 53:27.162
No, I'm cool, little man.

53:27.249 --> 53:29.158
Hey, you do your homework?

53:29.251 --> 53:31.661
- Yes, sir.
- I said, did you do your homework?

53:31.797 --> 53:34.085
- Hmm? Hmm?
- Y... Yes, sir.

53:34.215 --> 53:39.042
- What about you, little miss?
Did you do all your homework?
- I don't have any homework.

53:39.178 --> 53:41.636
You don't have no homework?

53:41.724 --> 53:43.633
All right, time to go back to bed.
Let's go.

53:43.726 --> 53:47.557
¶ Hut-two-three-four
Make a right at the right door ¶

53:47.688 --> 53:51.554
¶ Make your choice 'cause you got
to grow up to be successful¶¶

53:51.691 --> 53:54.528
I hope this isn't
an inconvenience for you.

53:54.613 --> 53:56.984
Not at all.
You seem like a nice man.

53:57.073 --> 54:00.406
Terrance can use
a few of those in his life.

54:00.535 --> 54:02.407
- Good night.
- Good night.

54:02.536 --> 54:04.411
Thanks.

54:09.961 --> 54:11.870
- Hey.
- Mm.

54:11.963 --> 54:15.378
Mmm. Mmm.

56:15.593 --> 56:18.796
You know, I never noticed before,
but you got really nice eyes.

56:18.929 --> 56:21.135
- Shut up!
- But you do.

56:21.264 --> 56:23.802
Let's get this over with.
I can't believe it.

56:23.934 --> 56:27.055
- I'm committing armed robbery
for two flashlights.
- Don't worry about it.

56:27.146 --> 56:29.104
Let's go.

56:45.373 --> 56:48.292
Freeze, motherfucker!

56:48.378 --> 56:51.995
You move your ass so much
as an inch, I'll blow it off!

56:52.131 --> 56:54.420
You hear me, motherfucker?

56:54.508 --> 56:56.583
- Hey.
- You hear me? What?

56:56.676 --> 57:01.257
- Why you acting so mean?
- Hey, look, man. Now ain't
the fuckin' time, all right?

57:01.350 --> 57:04.385
- You say scary shit, it scares 'em.
- Yeah, but you have a gun.

57:04.519 --> 57:08.053
Plus, what you're doing
is a stereotypical robber thing.

57:08.188 --> 57:12.852
I mean, it's a lot scarier
if someone with a gun is calm
and cool and collected, man.

57:12.987 --> 57:15.192
That's bullshit, man.
Don't...

57:15.322 --> 57:17.445
Excuse me, sir.

57:17.532 --> 57:24.787
Come here.

57:27.084 --> 57:30.287
Now, look, Henry,

57:30.379 --> 57:32.916
we're gonna take
some things outta here,

57:33.048 --> 57:37.177
and you're just gonna stand there.

57:38.972 --> 57:41.048
You got a problem with that?

57:41.182 --> 57:43.589
No.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.937
Good.

57:49.691 --> 57:54.352
Now, honestly, which one
did you think was scarier?

57:56.239 --> 57:59.491
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

58:00.953 --> 58:03.159
He was scarier.

58:03.247 --> 58:07.540
Really? You didn't find
what he did contrived?

58:07.667 --> 58:10.540
No. It was scary.

58:10.672 --> 58:13.209
Well, what part?

58:13.341 --> 58:17.042
Well, the, uh...
"Freeze, motherfucker" part was scary.

58:17.178 --> 58:20.548
And then he led me to believe
that if I moved my ass,

58:20.683 --> 58:23.303
it might be blown off.

58:25.812 --> 58:28.303
You were scary too.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.930
Oh, come on. You're just saying that.
You don't have to lie.

58:31.067 --> 58:33.986
No, I'm not.
I thought you were very scary.

58:34.114 --> 58:35.986
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:36.115 --> 58:39.650
- Well, thank you, Henry.
- Yo, check it out.

58:39.785 --> 58:42.322
They're flashlights
with A.M. /F.M. radio on it.

58:42.454 --> 58:47.033
They all that. You can listen to
your music while the light's on, boy.

58:47.126 --> 58:49.119
All right, all right!

58:49.253 --> 58:52.503
Come on.

58:57.054 --> 59:00.588
Freeze, sucker-bitch!

59:00.682 --> 59:03.469
That was much better.

59:03.602 --> 59:07.268
Thank you, Henry.
See ya later now.

59:07.398 --> 59:10.352

Yeah, come on over here
and meet Ginger and Mary Ann.

Ow! God!

01:01:04.229 --> 01:01:07.846
- Hey, Nick, what floor is it on?
- Fifteenth.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.313
- What fifteenth?
- Come on.

01:01:10.443 --> 01:01:12.518
Why can't we just
use the elevator?

01:01:12.611 --> 01:01:15.614
- 'Cause there's a guard
that patrols the building.
- This is bullshit!

01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.026
Come on, man. It's Saturday night.
They're not gonna be there anyway.

01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:21.906
I know we're gonna go back Monday and
get him. I just wanna check it out.

01:01:22.038 --> 01:01:23.911
Take a left here, will you?

01:01:24.039 --> 01:01:27.660
You seriously busted up my party.
You know that.

01:01:27.795 --> 01:01:30.416
Those girls were attracted to you.
Christ's sake, they're only human.

01:01:30.547 --> 01:01:33.169
- You're a handsome man.
We will go back.
- I'll hold you to that.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.086
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- What's the matter with you?

01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:39.970
You sharp.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.056
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:01:48.357 --> 01:01:51.609
Beat you.

01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:54.488
- I carried the damn bag.
- I still beat you.

01:01:54.614 --> 01:01:57.366
Beat me at what?
Climbing steps?

01:01:58.784 --> 01:02:01.538
Guess we'll call you
the "Step King. "

01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:09.286
Oh, shit.

01:02:11.214 --> 01:02:13.458
No problem.
I know the code.

01:02:19.182 --> 01:02:22.135
- What?
- Come on. Come on.

01:02:23.894 --> 01:02:26.268
Shit!

01:02:26.357 --> 01:02:28.645
That asshole must've
changed the code.

01:02:28.775 --> 01:02:31.147
Step aside. Let me take a look.
Let me take a look.

01:02:31.278 --> 01:02:33.354
Okay, let me look.
Mm-hmm.

01:02:33.487 --> 01:02:36.157
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:02:36.282 --> 01:02:40.909
- What are you gonna do?
- You got 12 possible stations.
You're only using seven.

01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:44.905
I'm gonna make the other five
stations active, run a test mode...

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:47.449
and force the system
into rotation.

01:02:47.544 --> 01:02:49.669
What does that mean?

01:02:52.133 --> 01:02:55.050
We got five minutes.

01:03:03.812 --> 01:03:06.766
Here. Put on your mask.

01:03:06.898 --> 01:03:10.562
Is that mask sweaty? I think
that's the one I hid behind my balls.

01:03:12.697 --> 01:03:14.238
All right.

01:03:37.472 --> 01:03:40.389
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, all right.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:43.849
Ooh, yeah. Let's go.
We got three minutes. Let's go.

01:03:43.936 --> 01:03:46.394
- Lookin' good.
- Yeah.

01:03:46.524 --> 01:03:50.568
Put the money in there.
Let's go. All right. Let's go.

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:56.739
Here we go. Money.
Money.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:59.240
Let's go.
Mask, mask.

01:04:02.456 --> 01:04:06.039
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, baby. Let's go!

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:24.014
What the hell
are you doin'? Nick?

01:04:29.817 --> 01:04:32.904
Okay, that's real clever, Nick.
Let's go.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.066
Come on, man.

01:04:43.957 --> 01:04:45.916
Ah.

01:04:46.003 --> 01:04:49.620
This is very nice.
It's very nice. It's very nice.

01:04:49.756 --> 01:04:53.006
Oh. I don't think I've ever seen
a more beautiful piece of shit.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:55.126
Nick.

01:04:55.219 --> 01:04:57.890
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.

01:04:58.015 --> 01:05:02.973
Aaah!

01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:05.219
Yeah!

01:05:05.354 --> 01:05:09.022
That's great. That's great.
You done cut the dick off a statue.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.987
How's it feel, Phillip?

01:05:15.116 --> 01:05:19.743
You had it all, but it wasn't enough
for you. You had to mess with me.

01:05:21.206 --> 01:05:24.325
Nobody messes with Nick Beam.

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:26.908
Ooh.

01:05:38.265 --> 01:05:41.182
¶¶

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.572
¶ I feel lucky ¶

01:05:58.745 --> 01:06:01.532
¶ I just feel that way ¶

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:06.918
¶ I'm on a bus
to Atlantic City ¶

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.710
¶ Later on today ¶

01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:17.385
- Your face, man. You showed your face.
- It doesn't matter.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:22.051
It does matter. They catch you,
they catch me. It damn well matters!

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:26.059
¶ I'm a winner ¶

01:06:26.147 --> 01:06:29.649
Hey, man, look at me. Look at me, man.
I'm not goin' down for this shit.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:37.904
¶ And now I know ¶

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.069
¶ Why I've been sent ¶¶

01:07:00.977 --> 01:07:02.849
Hmm.

01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:13.861
¶¶

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:21.451
¶ Little rump shaker
She can really shake and bake ¶

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.698
¶ She's got skills ¶

01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:29.382
- ¶ Watch her slippin' and a slidin' ¶
- Here!

01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:31.962
- ¶ Makin' booty left to right ¶
- Here!

01:07:32.092 --> 01:07:34.630
¶ She's got skills ¶¶

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.723
Hmm. The alarm
must've been set.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.736
¶¶

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:59.159
¶¶

01:07:59.245 --> 01:08:01.403
¶¶

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:08.160
¶ Addressing the groove
I see you're drinkin' again ¶

01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:12.460
¶ You're smokin' smack
inside your cigarettes
and lookin' pale and thin ¶

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:15.044
¶ It's a shame ¶

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:19.176
¶ It's a pity
in New York City ¶

01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:21.509
¶ Well ¶

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:40.287
¶ Well, well, well
well, well ¶

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:43.285
¶ Something has changed ¶

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:45.658
¶ The way these people think ¶¶

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.837
¶¶

01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:59.386
¶ Hey there, lonely girl ¶

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:03.466
¶ Lonely girl ¶

01:09:03.604 --> 01:09:08.765
¶ Let me make
your broken heart like new ¶

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.654
- Oh, shit.
- ¶ Hey there, lonely... ¶¶

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:27.703
White people.

01:09:32.341 --> 01:09:35.760
Our dates.

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.947
Oh!

01:09:55.075 --> 01:09:57.992
Oh. Ohh, shit.

01:09:58.119 --> 01:10:00.447
Oh-ho-ho.
Look at this, man!

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.083
Mama-say, mama-sa, makusa!
Oh, smack me two times!

01:10:05.169 --> 01:10:07.127
Calm down.

01:10:07.213 --> 01:10:09.786
My son is going
to the best schools.

01:10:09.923 --> 01:10:12.796
My daughter, she ain't even gonna know
what a food stamp is.

01:10:12.928 --> 01:10:17.056
My wife, we goin' out all the time.

01:10:17.182 --> 01:10:19.138
All the time!

01:10:22.021 --> 01:10:24.144
What's wrong with you, man?

01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:26.349
Nothing.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:30.895
You sweatin' that bullshit,
ain't you? You did what
you had to do to that guy, man.

01:10:31.029 --> 01:10:34.981
Don't worry about it,
all right? Put that shit
behind you. Where you goin'?

01:10:35.118 --> 01:10:38.486
Where you goin'?
Where you goin'?

01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:41.539
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna take a walk.

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:43.539
All right.
Well, hurry back.

01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:46.587
I got willpower,
but I don't know how much.

01:10:46.714 --> 01:10:50.296
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah.

01:10:50.508 --> 01:10:52.667
¶ There is somethin' ¶

01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:56.544
¶ On your mind ¶

01:11:00.644 --> 01:11:05.223
¶ By the way
you look at me ¶

01:11:09.821 --> 01:11:12.062
¶ There is somethin' ¶

01:11:12.198 --> 01:11:16.492
¶ On your mind, honey ¶

01:11:20.207 --> 01:11:23.741
Did you ever do somethin' that you
thought would make you feel great?

01:11:23.877 --> 01:11:25.751
In a weird way,
you almost feel worse.

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:28.713
Revenge, huh?
Some things hurt no matter what.

01:11:28.839 --> 01:11:30.962
That must be a fact of life.

01:11:31.092 --> 01:11:34.711
- ¶ And what you're thinkin' ¶
- Hi!

01:11:34.847 --> 01:11:37.717
Hi!
Nick.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:41.099
I can't believe it.
What are you doin' here?

01:11:41.227 --> 01:11:44.433
- Danielle.
- Oops.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.056
I don't know what I'm doin' here.

01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:51.984
- What are you doin' here?
- Sheila, my best friend...
Well, she used to be my best friend.

01:11:52.114 --> 01:11:54.569
I guess, technically,
Marcy would be my best friend.

01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:57.329
I mean, they both think they're
my best friend, which is okay by me.

01:11:57.455 --> 01:12:01.748
But once I did have this
nightmare where Sheila and Marcy
are sitting next to each other,

01:12:01.875 --> 01:12:04.080
and this Eskimo guy comes over
and says, "Pick. "

01:12:04.168 --> 01:12:07.420
I thought I was gonna die. I mean,
an Eskimo guy. What is that all about?

01:12:07.507 --> 01:12:10.922
- Anyway, Sheila's visiting
and she's staying here.

01:12:11.051 --> 01:12:13.423
So I thought I'd take her
to a party and show her a good time.

01:12:13.554 --> 01:12:17.551
And she meets this guy and goes home
with him instead. And, oh, well.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.513
You really look good.

01:12:20.645 --> 01:12:23.599
You look...
You look good too.

01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:27.057
- Thank you.
- Do you want... a drink?

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:29.774
Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure.

01:12:30.948 --> 01:12:32.940
You know, I'm such a klutz.

01:12:33.032 --> 01:12:36.152
I spilled beer
all over my dress earlier.

01:12:36.286 --> 01:12:40.614
And, well, I think it's stained.
Did it stain, Nick?

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:54.633
I have Sheila's room key.
You wanna come up?

01:12:54.723 --> 01:12:57.295
- ¶ Let's get hot ¶
- ¶ Oh, yes, it's ladies' night ¶

01:12:57.433 --> 01:12:59.758
¶ And the vibes is right ¶

01:12:59.852 --> 01:13:04.478
- ¶ Oh, yes, it's ladies' night
Oh, what a night ¶
- ¶ Oh, what a night ¶

01:13:04.564 --> 01:13:08.777
¶ Oh, yes, it's ladies' night
and the feeling's right ¶

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:13.653
- ¶ Oh, yes, it's ladies' night
Oh, what a night ¶
- ¶ Oh, what a night ¶¶

01:13:22.334 --> 01:13:26.331
Nick, Nick, use your key, man.

01:13:29.092 --> 01:13:31.084
All right.
All right, Nick. Damn!

01:13:32.762 --> 01:13:36.841
- Hey, Nick, why didn't you
just use your key?
- Turn your bed down?

01:13:51.741 --> 01:13:54.196
Stay.

01:13:57.412 --> 01:14:02.038
¶¶

01:14:13.595 --> 01:14:15.756
¶ The lady is lookin' good ¶

01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:20.018
- ¶ Just like the lady should ¶
- ¶ Just like the lady should ¶

01:14:20.103 --> 01:14:24.052
I've been thinking about this
for so long. I want you so bad.

01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:26.268
I just wanted to
make her happy.

01:14:26.402 --> 01:14:29.153
This is gonna be a night
that you won't forget.

01:14:29.279 --> 01:14:31.236
I try to forget,
but I can't.

01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:33.232
Give it to me, Nick.

01:14:33.325 --> 01:14:35.649
Give! That's all
I did, was give.

01:14:45.588 --> 01:14:49.587
Nick? Nick, you're really putting
a damper on the mood here.

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.877
I'm sorry.
I'm...

01:14:51.971 --> 01:14:55.220
Danielle, I can't.
I just can't.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:00.016
¶ I just wanna make you mine ¶

01:15:00.144 --> 01:15:03.266
¶ We'll be together
till the end of time ¶¶

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.732
Hey, Kareem. Are you aware
that Charlie and I...

01:15:06.818 --> 01:15:10.602
had intended to come up here
and cap your punk ass?

01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:12.612
And your girlfriend Nick.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:16.573
But, shit, you two muffins
did such an outstanding job
with this financing,

01:15:16.662 --> 01:15:19.284
who could think
about killing at a time like this?

01:15:19.373 --> 01:15:22.955
Thanks.
Your approval means a lot.

01:15:23.043 --> 01:15:27.291
- Did I tell you to speak?
Did I tell you to speak?
- Charlie... no.

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:29.416
That's gonna be too loud.

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.132
Too loud.

01:16:01.585 --> 01:16:03.873
Hello?

01:16:04.003 --> 01:16:07.419
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:16:07.549 --> 01:16:11.168
Oh, my God!
Nick, is that you? Are you okay?

01:16:11.262 --> 01:16:13.504
I'm fine.

01:16:13.639 --> 01:16:17.968
Oh, thank God!
I didn't know if, if you...

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.973
I thought that...
You're not hurt?

01:16:22.063 --> 01:16:26.892
- No.
- Oh, thank God! Where are you?

01:16:27.027 --> 01:16:30.231
Look, Ann, let's not make this
harder than it has to be.

01:16:30.364 --> 01:16:32.522
I saw you.

01:16:32.657 --> 01:16:35.197
- What?
- I saw you.

01:16:35.287 --> 01:16:39.533
- I know.
- Saw me what?
What are you talking about?

01:16:39.624 --> 01:16:42.459
Come on. Do you have to do this?
You and Phillip.

01:16:42.585 --> 01:16:45.751
- What about him?
- You're denying it. She's denying it.

01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:50.128
I don't believe this.
Friday afternoon. Remember?

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:55.217
Well, guess what.
I came home early. I saw you, Ann.

01:16:56.682 --> 01:16:58.642
- I was there.
- Oh.

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:01.011
Oh, no.

01:17:01.105 --> 01:17:03.726
Yeah. Oh, no.

01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:08.898
Nick, I was still
at work Friday afternoon.

01:17:09.029 --> 01:17:14.321
At work? Well, your clone
was at home screwing my boss.

01:17:14.452 --> 01:17:17.074
Nick, it was my sister.

01:17:17.205 --> 01:17:21.204
Remember I told you she was
coming next Friday with her fiancé?

01:17:21.294 --> 01:17:24.911
Well, I made a mistake.
It was this Friday.
They called from the airport.

01:17:25.005 --> 01:17:28.919
I told them about the key
in the planter. I called,
but you'd already left the office.

01:17:29.009 --> 01:17:31.499
So I left you a message
on the machine at home.

01:17:31.636 --> 01:17:35.635
What about... What about the cuff links?
Phillip's cuff links were on the sink.

01:17:35.766 --> 01:17:38.803
Honey, they've been in the dresser
since the Christmas party.

01:17:38.936 --> 01:17:42.518
I left them on the counter so you'd
finally remember to bring them to him.

01:17:42.647 --> 01:17:44.476
So you're not having
an affair?

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:46.934
No, you dick!

01:17:47.069 --> 01:17:49.276
You still love me?

01:17:49.405 --> 01:17:51.694
More than anything
in the world.

01:17:51.824 --> 01:17:55.823
You... You wouldn't believe
what I've been through.

01:17:55.955 --> 01:17:59.121
You're gonna laugh, but I actually...

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.449
Shit.

01:18:01.585 --> 01:18:04.538
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- Shit!

01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:07.876
- What's the matter? What?
- Shit!

01:18:08.009 --> 01:18:09.966
Shit! Shit!

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:12.217
- Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:20.469
Going down.

01:18:31.909 --> 01:18:33.817
- Don't touch it.
- Oh, man.

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.662
Oh, man.

01:18:43.338 --> 01:18:46.836
I think I can open the door
and catch the sheet.

01:18:46.924 --> 01:18:49.249
- Don't touch the sheet, please.
- No, no.

01:18:49.385 --> 01:18:53.084
- No, don't move. Don't move.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
I done moved the hand.

01:18:53.221 --> 01:18:56.840
I don't think you should be moving
right now. I think you're moving.

01:18:56.934 --> 01:18:59.508
- Call the paramedics. Listen to me.
- All right.

01:18:59.604 --> 01:19:02.936
Get them here
as fast as you can!

01:19:03.065 --> 01:19:05.354
Have them meet me
with a gurney.

01:19:05.444 --> 01:19:08.114
- Wait. Let me practice.
- Let you practice?

01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:12.022
I'm hangin' on a fuckin' ledge, man.

01:19:12.117 --> 01:19:15.117
- I don't wanna die like this, Nick.
- All right.

01:19:15.244 --> 01:19:17.203
I wasn't tryin'
to stick you up, man!

01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:20.700
First, I'm gonna say "one. "
Then I'm gonna say "two,"
then "three. " Then I'm gonna...

01:19:20.793 --> 01:19:22.702
- Do it.
- I can't hear you.

01:19:22.795 --> 01:19:26.542
- I'm gonna start with one
and count to three!
- Okay.

01:19:26.673 --> 01:19:29.047
Ready?
One.

01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:31.135
- Right.
- Two.

01:19:31.263 --> 01:19:35.212
- I can't hear you!
You gotta be louder, Nick!
- I said, "two"!

01:19:35.308 --> 01:19:38.723
- Are you on "two" already?
Start from "one"!
- I'll start again.

01:19:40.145 --> 01:19:41.392
One,

01:19:41.482 --> 01:19:43.225
- Right.
- two,

01:19:43.316 --> 01:19:45.225
- I got you.
- three!

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.400
Nick!

01:19:47.529 --> 01:19:49.734
I got it!
I got it!

01:19:49.822 --> 01:19:52.280
Ha!

01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:56.739
Well, you go, boy!
You my...

01:20:09.886 --> 01:20:12.755
The elevator!
The money!

01:20:15.893 --> 01:20:18.016
Remind me
to kick your ass later.

01:20:35.246 --> 01:20:37.451
We're rich, man!

01:20:37.539 --> 01:20:40.246
- We are in the bigs.
- Charlie, smell that.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:43.121
Oh, yes!
You, too, can be a millionaire!

01:20:43.212 --> 01:20:44.956
Hookers!

01:20:45.047 --> 01:20:48.083
Charlie, Charlie, smell this.

01:20:48.175 --> 01:20:50.084
- More hookers!
- Aaah!

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.551
- Hookers!
- We hit the mother lode, man!

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.302
What the fuck is that?

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.349
- Okay. What now?
- I don't know.

01:20:57.477 --> 01:21:01.891
- What do you mean?
I thought you had a plan.
- That was my plan: to ram them.

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:04.646
Ram them.

01:21:04.776 --> 01:21:07.813
Speed up!

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:11.949
- Shoot the mother... Shoot him!
- I got him! I got him!

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.827
- Jeez!
- Aaah!

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.161
Man, I'm tired of this shit.
Let's go!

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.000
Charlie!
Look out, Charlie!

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:36.764
I'm actually grabbing a gun
and going after bad guys.

01:21:36.894 --> 01:21:39.468
You the man.

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:47.525
All right.

01:21:53.703 --> 01:21:56.490
- You see 'em?
- No.

01:21:56.581 --> 01:21:59.201
I'II, uh...
I'll let you know.

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:02.460
Please do. Nick.

01:22:08.093 --> 01:22:11.461
What?

01:22:11.597 --> 01:22:14.385
You checkin' this shit out?

01:22:14.475 --> 01:22:18.389
Hey, Nick,
I like you like this;

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.723
you and your prom date
both having weapons.

01:22:21.814 --> 01:22:25.731
That way I don't have to kill
an unarmed couple. It's not my style.

01:22:25.821 --> 01:22:28.108
Put down the bag.

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:32.022
Paul Bunyan, come and take the bag.

01:22:32.117 --> 01:22:34.193
- Let me...
- You're an idiot! Shut up!

01:22:34.286 --> 01:22:36.197
- Shoot 'em.
- No, you're a fuckin' idiot!

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:40.239
Who are you? Crime Dog now?
Are you aware there's only two
kind of people on the planet?

01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:43.081
There are killers,
and then there's everybody else.

01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm a killer, Nick. Yes, yes,
yes, yes. What are you, Nick?

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:53.929
I'm married.

01:22:54.058 --> 01:22:55.930
Oh!

01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:58.386
Oh, you son of a...

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.519
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23:00.649 --> 01:23:03.400
Oh, shit!

01:23:03.484 --> 01:23:05.393
What are you,
fuckin' out of your mind?

01:23:05.486 --> 01:23:08.059
- Fuck!
- What, are you crazy?

01:23:13.369 --> 01:23:17.284
Huh? Who's in control now?

01:23:17.374 --> 01:23:19.780
Hand over the bag,

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:23.460
or else my man Nick Beam here
gonna put one in your ass.

01:23:23.548 --> 01:23:26.120
Ain't that right, Nick?

01:23:30.219 --> 01:23:35.014
- I'll roll over.
- Okay, I see it. I see it.

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.977
Let me try to get around
and get you.

01:23:38.104 --> 01:23:41.803
No, it's not...

01:23:41.898 --> 01:23:44.688
Other end of the alley.
- Charlie, it's the police.

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.271
- Oh, yes!
- Thank God you're here.
Oh, this nightmare's over.

01:23:48.364 --> 01:23:52.196
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Put the gun down!

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.817
Put that gun down,
you stupid pig!

01:23:54.954 --> 01:23:57.494
Come on, man!

01:24:00.961 --> 01:24:03.796
It's them.

01:24:03.881 --> 01:24:08.295
Some folks in Arizona are gonna be
mighty happy to see you boys.

01:24:10.971 --> 01:24:13.509
Officer! Officer,
two other guys...

01:24:15.893 --> 01:24:19.012
"I'm married. "
Ka-blam!

01:24:19.146 --> 01:24:22.351
- You're too much.
- Is the money all there?

01:24:22.443 --> 01:24:26.107
- Looks like it.
- Great. We have just enough time
to get it back.

01:24:28.489 --> 01:24:30.647
Excuse me?

01:24:30.741 --> 01:24:33.946
We have to put the money back.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.822
No, no.

01:24:35.914 --> 01:24:39.248
Maybe you're a little bit confused
about the purpose of a robbery.

01:24:39.376 --> 01:24:42.960
Oh, T., I didn't tell you. When we
were at the hotel, I called my wife.

01:24:43.089 --> 01:24:45.165
Everything's all right.
You see, it wasn't her.

01:24:45.258 --> 01:24:48.543
She wasn't even there.
Isn't that great?

01:24:50.429 --> 01:24:53.050
It was her sister
and her sister's fiancé.

01:24:53.181 --> 01:24:56.967
I don't give a damn if it was
her Uncle Fester and Gumby.

01:24:57.104 --> 01:24:59.808
You ain't takin'
this money anywhere, man.

01:24:59.939 --> 01:25:03.059
I don't wanna
hear all that.

01:25:07.615 --> 01:25:09.772
- Let go. Let go.
- Gimme the bag. You let go.

01:25:09.908 --> 01:25:11.652
- Let go of the bag.
- It's not your money.

01:25:11.785 --> 01:25:13.244
- It's not your money.
- It's not your money!

01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:15.575
- It's not yours. It's half mine.
- Let go!

01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:18.915
- Let go! Let go!
- You let go!

01:25:25.466 --> 01:25:28.039
Get back here!

01:25:48.949 --> 01:25:52.864
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. And you?

01:25:52.996 --> 01:25:55.404
I'll live.

01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:59.875
Can't let you take the money, Nick.

01:26:01.045 --> 01:26:03.879
T., my life
is in that bag.

01:26:04.005 --> 01:26:08.550
Nick, even if you wanted
to take the money back, you can't.

01:26:08.678 --> 01:26:10.967
Your face is on
the video, man.

01:26:11.097 --> 01:26:13.468
They only review the tapes
if something's missing.

01:26:13.599 --> 01:26:17.100
I can go into work early
and bring it back. No one know.

01:26:21.191 --> 01:26:23.100
T.

01:26:26.696 --> 01:26:29.615
I can get my life back.

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:41.335
Here.

01:26:44.674 --> 01:26:49.916
You forget one thing, Nick.
I get my life back too.

01:27:23.964 --> 01:27:28.841
¶ Money don't make
my world go 'round ¶

01:27:28.929 --> 01:27:31.965
¶ I'm reaching out
for the higher ground ¶

01:27:34.267 --> 01:27:38.218
¶ To a warm
and peaceful place ¶

01:27:39.482 --> 01:27:43.182
¶ I can rest
my weary face ¶

01:27:44.737 --> 01:27:47.737
¶ Life's answers
we try to find ¶

01:27:47.822 --> 01:27:49.900
¶ Oh, we try to find
Yes, we try to find ¶

01:27:49.993 --> 01:27:53.444
¶ Battling inside our minds ¶

01:27:55.248 --> 01:28:00.123
¶ Where do I go from here ¶

01:28:00.252 --> 01:28:03.954
¶ Will all my friends
be there ¶

01:28:05.175 --> 01:28:07.962
¶ 'Cause we're living
we're living ¶

01:28:08.095 --> 01:28:10.382
¶ In a crazy maze ¶

01:28:10.471 --> 01:28:13.260
¶ And we're fighting
we're fighting ¶

01:28:13.393 --> 01:28:15.266
¶ To rise above the haze ¶

01:28:15.394 --> 01:28:18.229
¶ Lights at the end
of the tunnel ¶

01:28:18.314 --> 01:28:21.100
¶ Sometimes
the journey's long ¶

01:28:21.191 --> 01:28:23.682
¶ There are many theories ¶

01:28:23.818 --> 01:28:27.153

¶ I close my eyes
I take a chance ¶

01:28:43.465 --> 01:28:47.879

a different dance ¶

¶ Healthy mind
and lots of spice ¶

01:29:00.359 --> 01:29:03.857
¶ Running barefoot
through the trees ¶¶

01:29:03.986 --> 01:29:06.145
Oh, my God!

01:29:07.407 --> 01:29:10.157
Ow. Ouch.

01:29:10.242 --> 01:29:12.949
What happened to you?

01:29:13.039 --> 01:29:15.493
It's a long story.

01:29:15.582 --> 01:29:17.990
- I got shot.
- What?

01:29:18.085 --> 01:29:21.168
And I... I think
I'm wanted in Arizona.

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.173
Plus, my shoes caught on fire.

01:29:30.139 --> 01:29:33.341
You told me you were selling me
the top of the line.
The top of the line is digital.

01:29:33.433 --> 01:29:35.926
Did you sell me a digital?
No, you did not.

01:29:36.063 --> 01:29:38.351
So, I'm bringing it back,
and I expect a full refund.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:42.518
If you do not give me a refund,
you will not be doing business
with myself or my company.

01:29:42.651 --> 01:29:44.940
Thank you.

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.231
- Hmm.
- So,

01:29:47.366 --> 01:29:49.654
did you hear?

01:29:49.743 --> 01:29:53.527
- What?
- Some, uh, vandals
broke in over the weekend.

01:29:53.663 --> 01:29:57.912
- What?
- Well, nothing was stolen.
They cut the...

01:29:58.044 --> 01:30:00.119
the... thingy...

01:30:00.254 --> 01:30:03.789
off P.B.'s statue.

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:10.219
Um, they're reviewing
the videotape.

01:30:17.479 --> 01:30:20.399
- Hi, everybody. How's it going?
- Not now, Nick.

01:30:22.862 --> 01:30:25.648
- Did anybody see that
game last night? Hoo.
- What game?

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:28.817
- Oh, that game. Overtime.
- Will you please shut up!

01:30:31.494 --> 01:30:36.073
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Oh, you pig. Oh, you pig.

01:30:39.003 --> 01:30:41.919
Oooh! Oh.

01:30:42.046 --> 01:30:43.922
Well, that's it.
What's done is done. Listen.

01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:48.510
- I've got this great idea for
the new McGinty Cracker mascot.
- Move, move! Thank you.

01:30:48.638 --> 01:30:51.425
- This...
- Nick, shut up!

01:30:54.893 --> 01:30:57.469
What's happening?

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:03.151
Well, what is this?

01:31:03.278 --> 01:31:07.111
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know.

01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:11.535
- Somebody must've recorded
over the tape.

01:31:11.662 --> 01:31:16.204
- Who had access?
- Uh... there was an electrician
in here this morning.

01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:18.872
What electrician?
I did not order an electrician!

01:31:19.004 --> 01:31:23.629
I did. The flickers on the...
fluorescent lights were flickering.

01:31:23.758 --> 01:31:26.249
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- This is terrible, Phil.

01:31:26.344 --> 01:31:28.466
- I would really like to be alone now.
- You should go.

01:31:28.553 --> 01:31:32.304
- You should go. You too.
- I would like to be
extremely alone for a minute.

01:31:32.434 --> 01:31:34.759
- I'm gonna leave you alone.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, Nick.

01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:44.109
All right now. Cut that out.
Y'all wanna eat?

01:31:44.197 --> 01:31:45.987
- Yes.
- All right.

01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:49.027
- Don't burn the meat.
- I don't never burn the meat.

01:31:49.159 --> 01:31:51.447
- Uh-huh. What
happened the last time?
- Hey, Dad don't burn the meat.

01:31:51.536 --> 01:31:54.705
- I'm gonna put some...
- Joey. Tonya.

01:31:54.833 --> 01:31:58.497
- Yeah, that's...
- Go see your mama, boy. You know.

01:31:58.628 --> 01:32:01.582
Now this is
my very special mustard.

01:32:01.714 --> 01:32:04.085
- Don't let nobody touch that.
- Okay, Mama.

01:32:04.216 --> 01:32:06.970
Yeah.

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:09.675
So, how's
the electrician business?

01:32:09.806 --> 01:32:12.677
Hey.

01:32:12.809 --> 01:32:15.679
Not bad.
The hours are a bitch.

01:32:15.811 --> 01:32:18.814
I wanna thank you.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.691
I don't know why... I just wanna say
I appreciate what you did.

01:32:25.446 --> 01:32:29.114
Well, don't mention it. How's that?
How did you know where I was anyway?

01:32:31.037 --> 01:32:32.994
A friend gave me a tip.

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:37.239
A friend, huh?

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:40.295
- You hungry?
- Yes, we would love for you to join us.

01:32:40.422 --> 01:32:43.837
Wouldn't we, Mama?

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:49.262
I talked to my boss today
after things settled down.

01:32:49.388 --> 01:32:54.017
Convinced him we need
a new security system. Got any ideas?

01:32:54.103 --> 01:32:56.640
Sure. I can help you
pick one out.

01:32:56.772 --> 01:33:00.188
You wanna run it?
We need someone trustworthy.

01:33:00.275 --> 01:33:03.062
I told him
I know just the guy.

01:33:03.194 --> 01:33:05.438
Well, I'm gonna have to
think about this, Nick.

01:33:05.574 --> 01:33:09.440
Right now, I'm weighing out several
lucrative offers. They rollin' in.

01:33:09.577 --> 01:33:11.984
A lot of people want me
to work for them right now.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:15.408
Now, that's just
the way I like it.

01:33:15.501 --> 01:33:18.750
All I need now is some
of Mama's special mustard.

01:33:18.878 --> 01:33:20.788
Stop.

01:33:27.472 --> 01:33:30.140
What'd I do?

01:33:41.152 --> 01:33:45.102
- Run, run!
- Stay down, Nick. Get on outta here.

01:33:45.197 --> 01:33:48.447
I'll beat you into the...

01:33:50.662 --> 01:33:53.413
¶ See you when you get there ¶

01:34:04.509 --> 01:34:08.044
¶ Now I seen places and faces
of things you ain't never
thought about thinkin' ¶

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:10.717
¶ If you ain't peeked then you
must be drinkin' and smokin' ¶

01:34:10.848 --> 01:34:14.350
¶ Pretendin' that you're locin'
but you're broken
Let me get you open ¶

01:34:14.479 --> 01:34:17.349
¶ Now, little Timmy got his diploma
and little Jimmy got life ¶

01:34:17.481 --> 01:34:20.317
¶ And Tamica around the corner
just took her first hit off the pipe ¶

01:34:20.401 --> 01:34:23.105
¶ The other homey shot the other
homey and ran off with his money ¶

01:34:23.195 --> 01:34:25.818
¶ And when the other homeys
heard about it, they thought
that it was funny ¶

01:34:25.949 --> 01:34:28.404
¶ But who's the dummy
'cause now you done lost a hustler ¶

01:34:28.534 --> 01:34:30.990
¶ A down-ass brother
done replaced by a bustler ¶

01:34:31.079 --> 01:34:33.404
¶ And though I got love for ya
I know I can't trust ya ¶

01:34:33.539 --> 01:34:36.244
¶ 'Cause my crew is rollin' numbers
and your crew is rollin' dusters ¶

01:34:36.377 --> 01:34:39.496
¶ And just because of that you act
like you don't like a brother no more ¶

01:34:39.588 --> 01:34:41.497
¶ I guess that's just
the way you go ¶

01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:45.539
¶ I ain't tryin' to preach
I believe I can reach
but your mind ain't prepared ¶

01:34:45.676 --> 01:34:47.550
¶ I see ya when you get there ¶

01:34:47.679 --> 01:34:51.843
¶ I'll see you
when you get there ¶

01:34:51.934 --> 01:34:54.259
¶ If you ever get there ¶

01:34:54.395 --> 01:34:57.514
¶ See you when you get there ¶

01:34:57.606 --> 01:35:02.234
¶ I'll see you when you get there ¶

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.817
¶ If you ever get there ¶

01:35:04.906 --> 01:35:08.073
¶ See you when you get there ¶

01:35:08.201 --> 01:35:10.525
¶ More temptation and faith
I guess we livin' for today ¶

01:35:10.619 --> 01:35:13.456
¶ I seen a man get swept off his feet
by a bull with an AK ¶

01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:15.989
¶ The situation's so twisted
everybody gettin' lifted ¶

01:35:16.084 --> 01:35:18.955
¶ I'm just tryin' to take care
of my kids and handle my business ¶

01:35:19.087 --> 01:35:21.542
¶ 'Cause it's way too serious
so you gotta pay close attention ¶

01:35:21.672 --> 01:35:24.213
¶ So you don't get caught
slippin' when they come
to do all the gettin' ¶

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:26.632
¶ Life is a big game so you gotta
play it with the big boys ¶

01:35:26.762 --> 01:35:29.336
¶ Some of us gotta run
a little faster 'cause
we gotta lay the straw ¶

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:32.301
¶ But I'd be a fool to surrender
when I know I can be a contender ¶

01:35:32.434 --> 01:35:34.927
¶ If everybody's ascended
then everybody can be a winner ¶

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:37.305
¶ No matter your rag colour
Deep down we all brothers ¶

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.061
¶ And we gonna set a time
Somebody up there still love us ¶

01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:42.862
¶ I'm gonna scuffle and struggle
with ya I'm breathless and weak ¶

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:45.566
¶ I done strived my whole life
to make it to the mountain peak ¶

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:48.114
¶ Always keep reachin'
Sure to grab onto somethin' ¶

01:35:48.244 --> 01:35:51.244
¶ I'll be there when you get there
waitin' with the sounds bumpin' ¶

01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:55.748
¶ I'll see you
when you get there ¶

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.119
¶ If you ever get there ¶

01:35:58.254 --> 01:36:01.539
¶ See you when you get there ¶

01:36:01.632 --> 01:36:06.294
¶ I'll see you when you get there ¶

01:36:06.429 --> 01:36:08.919
¶ If you ever get there ¶

01:36:09.055 --> 01:36:12.261
¶ See you when you get there ¶

01:36:12.393 --> 01:36:15.478
¶ As we walk down the road
of our destiny ¶

01:36:15.605 --> 01:36:18.273
¶ And the time comes to choose
which shall it be ¶

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:20.438
¶ The wide and crooked
or the straight and narrow ¶

01:36:20.526 --> 01:36:23.482
¶ We got one voice to give
and one life to live ¶

01:36:23.614 --> 01:36:26.449
¶ Stand up for somethin'
or lay down in the game ¶

01:36:26.533 --> 01:36:28.941
¶ Listen to the song
that we sing ¶

01:36:29.077 --> 01:36:31.069
¶ It's up to you
to make your beef ¶

01:36:31.162 --> 01:36:33.916
¶ I guess I'll see you
when you see me ¶

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.079

01:36:38.170 --> 01:36:41.124
