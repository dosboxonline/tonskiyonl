-ADAM: Let's get some shoes on you.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.425
I don't know what you did to her,

28:37.508 --> 28:41.095
but she hasn't eaten this much in months.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.888
-Really?
-It's nice.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.182
She loves to eat. (laughs)

28:45.266 --> 28:46.559
Whose child are you talking about?

28:46.642 --> 28:47.768
-(both laugh)
-I mean...

28:47.852 --> 28:51.730
I-I make her some Senegalese food,
and she loves it.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.441
Rose, you like the chebu jën, yes?

28:53.524 --> 28:56.026
-C'est bon? C'est bon?
-C'est bon.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.404
What did you do before you came here?

28:58.487 --> 29:01.198
-I was a teacher in Senegal.
-Right. Of course you were.

29:01.282 --> 29:04.743
I, um... I-I studied English
and French in school.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.787
You're a wonderful teacher.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.248
And you're clearly very smart, Aisha.
I know...

29:09.331 --> 29:12.334
I can tell you're not gonna be with us
for very long.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.920
Much as I'd like to keep you.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.675
Can I ask you something?

29:19.758 --> 29:21.719
Sure.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.930
I am having a difficult time
with the hours.

29:25.014 --> 29:26.557
Thank you.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.185
I don't mind working the hours,

29:29.268 --> 29:32.980
but I think Amy forgets sometimes,
um, to pay me.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.983
Um, there are many hours
I have not been paid.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.235
About a week's worth of pay.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.655
I'm sorry.

29:41.739 --> 29:42.990
I'll talk to her.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.868
I won't say you brought it up.
I'll talk to her.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.662
Well, I was wondering if...
if it's possible

29:48.746 --> 29:53.167
if you could be in charge of my pay
since your hours seem more flexible.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.795
Uh, I would like to, but...

29:56.879 --> 29:59.882

30:04.094 --> 30:05.346
You look amazing.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.264

-Nice to see you.

30:07.348 --> 30:08.557

-Remember Rose?

30:08.641 --> 30:11.894
Last time I saw you,
you were just a teeny, tiny thing.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.939
-Bonjour.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.315

30:17.691 --> 30:18.734
Hi.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.404
I'm gonna pay the bill, but, uh,
you guys should go on ahead.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.323
But I will talk to her about that at home.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.575
Okay. Thank you.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.405
-Do you want me to be following you?
-(chuckles): Oh.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.031
I like how you said that.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.158
(both chuckling)

31:08.242 --> 31:11.036
Uh, so you gonna tell me where you from?

31:11.120 --> 31:13.205
Or do you think I'm like
every other dumb American

is just one big-ass country?

I can't come to the phone,

36:41.491 --> 36:43.160
Come through.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.037
We'll have a good time.

Thank you.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.294
Enjoy.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.843
I feel like I've met you before.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.098
Very possibly. (chuckles)

37:46.181 --> 37:50.060
I lived all over West Africa
for ten years.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.561

37:51.645 --> 37:53.855
Fell in love with that continent.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.233

37:58.068 --> 38:00.237

38:01.780 --> 38:04.157

38:06.994 --> 38:08.829
(sighs):
Hmm.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.708
Ah.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.252
That's one of my favorites.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.505
It's an interpretation of Mami Wata.

38:18.588 --> 38:23.343

lures sexuality,

38:23.427 --> 38:27.431
money and promises of fertility,

38:27.514 --> 38:31.184
but they're very dangerous,

38:31.268 --> 38:34.771
unpredictable and impermanent.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.401
I feel like I saw her.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.487
Them.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.076
My grandmother believed in magic.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.786
But...

38:49.870 --> 38:52.164
me, I never did.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.084
Whether you do or not,

38:56.168 --> 38:59.004
you are magic.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.258
What's your boy's name?

39:05.260 --> 39:06.595
How do you know?

39:06.678 --> 39:07.971
MALIK:
All right.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.349
Sorry, sometimes Grandma
like to ask a lot of questions.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.852
Does she ask them of all the women
that come through here?

39:13.935 --> 39:16.730
Only the ones that pique my interest.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.732
But there haven't been many.

39:18.815 --> 39:19.983
That pique your interest?

39:20.067 --> 39:22.402
Or it's time to go.

39:22.486 --> 39:23.653
Mm, I love you, Grams.

39:23.737 --> 39:24.946
Stay out of trouble, all right?

39:25.030 --> 39:26.364
-Mm, maybe.
-Okay. Okay.

-Hmm?
-Have you done soul food before?

39:56.645 --> 39:58.271
-Is this soul food?
-This is soul food.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.524
-Wow. No, I haven't.
-No. Okay.

40:00.607 --> 40:03.735
-Uh, so there is one rule. One rule only.
-Okay. What's that?

40:03.819 --> 40:06.154
-Eat everything.
-(laughs) Okay.

40:06.238 --> 40:07.447
Thank you.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.033
-That was very good.

it was wonderful.

40:30.971 --> 40:33.265

-Okay.

-Mm-hmm. Mm!
-Mm.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.943

with the ability to see.

-(laughs): A witch?

41:03.420 --> 41:04.713
Nah.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.423
A priestess.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.258
-Like a psychic?
-Like a psychic.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.094

we call this marabout.

41:11.178 --> 41:13.305
That's Grams. Marabout. Marabouts.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.141

41:26.568 --> 41:28.278

41:28.361 --> 41:30.530
Yes, I do.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.532
Do you want to see a picture of him?

41:32.616 --> 41:33.783
I do.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.036
-Yes. Yes.
-All right.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.621
What's his name?

41:37.704 --> 41:39.539
His name is Lamine.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.251
And what's that mean?

41:43.335 --> 41:45.295
It means "chosen one."

41:45.378 --> 41:46.838
"Chosen one."

41:46.922 --> 41:49.216
Ooh, the chosen... Okay.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.676
-I get it now. Yes.
-(Aisha laughing)

41:51.760 --> 41:53.303
Look at this brother.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.430
-And that smile-- what?
-(Aisha laughs)

41:55.513 --> 41:57.641
He's beautiful. You know that?

41:58.725 --> 42:00.185
Thank you.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.687
-He's coming soon for his birthday.
-Mm.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.107
I haven't seen him in almost a year.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.568
Wow. That is...

42:08.652 --> 42:11.696
like a lifetime for a child.

42:12.906 --> 42:14.658
Yes, I know.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.702
And you?

42:17.786 --> 42:19.412
-And me?
-Yes.

42:19.496 --> 42:21.081
You have how many kids?

42:21.164 --> 42:23.291
Ooh. (clears throat)
