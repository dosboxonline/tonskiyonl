07:55.542 --> 07:56.875
The commissioner of police
was shocked to hear

07:56.959 --> 08:00.500
that Judge Ditton had
overstepped so egregiously.

08:00.583 --> 08:04.000
He seemed confident, however,
that neither you nor your men

08:04.083 --> 08:06.083

of the blame.

08:10.542 --> 08:12.750

-Inspector.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.500
-How did you know the police--
-I had rather expected it.

08:23.583 --> 08:26.125
I was surprised it took them
all of two days.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.750

-Primrose is a child,

08:50.750 --> 08:52.875

08:52.959 --> 08:56.583
Inspector Mundi clearly

in Mary Brighton.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.792
He couldn't have
authorized it himself.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.750
The superintendent
was pressured from above.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.583
But he wouldn't tell me
by whom.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.917
What about Lord Massen?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.083
I didn't realize when we met
what a... name he was.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.291
"A voice of
conservative Parliament."

09:12.375 --> 09:15.375
Anti-union,
anti-Suffragism,
anti-Belgian...

09:15.458 --> 09:17.917
Gilbert Massen and I
agree on almost nothing.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.083
It is the bedrock
of our friendship.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.000
But he's never mentioned
my work here.

09:24.083 --> 09:27.000
Although, after
Maladie's debut...

09:27.083 --> 09:28.959

a monthly charitable fete.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.625
There are philanthropists,
lecturers...

09:44.709 --> 09:46.125
The best families attend.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.458
Men of influence,
with wives of actual influence.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.834
This afternoon,
it's to be at my estate.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.500
I thought everyone
was in a panic.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.667
It's society.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.625
Doing nothing is how we panic.

09:57.709 --> 10:00.625
And it presents
a good opportunity
to put a pleasing face

10:00.709 --> 10:02.458
on London's new bogeyman.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.959

showing off their "turns,"

10:05.041 --> 10:07.875

10:09.208 --> 10:11.000
It may seem trite to you,

10:11.083 --> 10:13.375
but public opinion
is a brush fire.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.542
And we must come to them
to stop them barging in on us.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.458
Amalia:
She's right.

10:18.542 --> 10:20.667
Besides, it's a party.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.166
Bring a few of your charges
to my estate,

10:23.250 --> 10:25.208
no later than 2:00.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.667
I assume your estate
is quite large, then?

10:27.750 --> 10:28.834
I suppose.

10:28.917 --> 10:31.417
Good. 'Cause I'll be
bringing the tiger.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.875
General Pecking wants to make it
a military matter.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.250
Have the infantry
patrolling the city.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.125
I'm exhausted by the ways
that would go wrong.

10:43.208 --> 10:45.083

At least the public would--

10:45.166 --> 10:47.709
This is not about saving face.

but keeps attention on herself.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.291
And the rest of the group
are firmly with you now.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.625
No one doubts
we're under attack.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.166
Lord Broughton:
The House is going to nominate

11:00.250 --> 11:02.000
a special committee
on the Touched,

11:02.083 --> 11:05.125
which after careful
vetting, will be us.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.875
Prime Minister's going to move
the motion himself.

11:07.959 --> 11:08.959
Good for him.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.583
How many nephews
did we have to hire?

11:11.667 --> 11:13.917
(chuckles)
Two.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.709
I'll keep a statement
on the shooting vague

11:16.792 --> 11:19.125
and wrothful.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.041
No mention of Amalia True.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.417
Lord Broughton:
Of course not.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.208
Broome:
Mrs. True made more of
an impression on you

11:24.291 --> 11:25.959
than Maladie did.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.709
Lord Broughton:
Do you think she's at the root

11:27.792 --> 11:29.792
of our feminine plague?

11:29.875 --> 11:31.875
Or in league with whoever is?

11:31.959 --> 11:33.792
I don't know.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.291
But she's not a fool.

11:37.375 --> 11:40.291
And she's not a fucking baker.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.375
-(liquid pouring)
-Swann.

11:45.458 --> 11:46.917
Lord Massen.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.625
You're up early.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.166
I can leave my coffin by day,
if the smog's thick enough.

11:54.291 --> 11:55.792
You haven't read it?

11:55.875 --> 11:58.333
The Irishman, Bram Stoker.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.458
It's a clever
epistolary fantasia,

12:00.542 --> 12:03.834
-all about--
-I heard an ugly rumor
the other day.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.750
Well, all rumors
are ugly, Massen.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.625
No one whispers about virtue.

12:09.709 --> 12:12.041
You're turning your
Ferryman's Club

12:12.125 --> 12:14.250
into an actual business.

12:14.333 --> 12:18.417
Oh, this is awkward. Uh...

12:18.500 --> 12:20.959
I'm afraid there's already
a waiting list.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.917
-But if you like--
-And you have,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.542
among your entertainers,
a few of the afflicted.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.792
They're all in excellent health.

12:28.875 --> 12:32.166
But thank you
for the concern.

12:34.959 --> 12:38.333
I realize that
the unsavory antics

12:38.417 --> 12:40.291
at your loathsome soirées

12:40.375 --> 12:42.750
may have given you leverage
over several in our circle,

12:42.834 --> 12:45.792
but you cannot think
to operate in a public arena.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.291
Especially with the Touched.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.792
-Well, there's no law
against them.
-(sighs)

12:49.875 --> 12:52.959
There's been a massacre, Swann.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.125
Society will not abide
your pandering,

12:55.208 --> 12:57.750
-if it thinks that--
-Requests for membership
to the Ferryman's

12:57.834 --> 13:00.792
have doubled since the opera.

13:00.875 --> 13:04.500
Horror and fascination
go arm in arm.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.917
(exhales)
You should have read
the Stoker.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.667
If your father were to learn

13:13.750 --> 13:16.166
-that you--
-My father approved
of the whole venture.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.875
-(liquid pouring)
-And then he put
a jam roll in his pocket,

13:18.959 --> 13:21.667
and went looking for
his childhood dog.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.250
(glass rattling)

13:24.250 --> 13:25.500
(breathing heavily)

13:25.583 --> 13:26.959
(exhales)

13:27.041 --> 13:31.083
I should warn you--
I play a lot of squash.

13:34.083 --> 13:37.750
Alastair Swann had one of
the finest minds in England.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.458
To make light of its
tragic dissolution
is beneath even you.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.542
Oh, I remember his fine mind.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.667
And his fine fists.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.083
I may not be the fighter
my brother was,

13:49.166 --> 13:51.458
but I've had my lessons.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.458
The Ferryman's opens tonight.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.917
And as for the Touched,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.625
well, they have a right
to earn a living.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.500
I doubt even you
can change that.

14:09.125 --> 14:12.083
I used to think your father's
mind went to field

14:12.166 --> 14:14.083
because your brother
Caleb drowned.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.834
(scoffs)

14:16.917 --> 14:19.041
More likely, it's because...

14:19.125 --> 14:20.625
you didn't.

14:23.625 --> 14:27.834
Well, I assure you,
you're about to.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.375
(footsteps departing)

14:33.041 --> 14:34.667
(exhales)

14:36.667 --> 14:38.792
-(laughter, indistinct chatter)
-Amalia: Harriet.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.125
Aye. Her "turn's" charming.

14:41.208 --> 14:44.041
Myrtle.
Primrose never goes out.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.417
Shy about her stature.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.583
-Myrtle calms her.
-All right.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.917
-Wendy?
-Bendy Wendy.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.333
That's a rotten thing to--

14:52.417 --> 14:55.500
No, it, it's, it's fair.
And it rhymes.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.542
I suppose her contorting's
a bit...

14:57.625 --> 15:00.500
-Alarming?
-...intimate for
mixed company.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.667
Amalia:
Lucy.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.250
I'm not ruling out
another attack,

15:05.333 --> 15:07.583
especially with Myrtle
in the mix.

15:07.667 --> 15:10.750
I'm sure Lavinia has security,
but Lucy's ours.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.291
Do you ever wonder
why Miss Bidlow

15:12.375 --> 15:15.792
started The Orphanage
that she's never comfortable in?

15:15.875 --> 15:18.125
I'm not sure
she's comfortable anywhere.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.875
She didn't pick this cause
out of a hat.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.125
She knows what
it's like to be dismissed.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.625
Couple of new things,

15:23.709 --> 15:26.125
in case you find Maladie
before we're back from
Lavinia's party.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.542
-Think someone
already invented these.
-Mmm.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.083
-(inhales sharply)
-(blinder pops)

15:33.500 --> 15:34.792
(sighs)
I'm hoping they'll work

15:34.875 --> 15:36.792
against Maladie's awful
eye glow. Can't say, but--

15:36.875 --> 15:38.875
Amalia:
Until we understand
her "turn," it can't hurt.

15:38.959 --> 15:41.375
Besides, these are wonderful.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.500
Now this is for
Bonfire Annie.

15:45.583 --> 15:46.917
She gets all fired up,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.583
-she gets this.
-(machine charging)

15:48.667 --> 15:50.000
(vibrating)

15:50.083 --> 15:51.875
-(pops)
-Oh!

15:53.583 --> 15:55.291
Evildoers beware.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.667
It's, it's only a prototype.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.375
Rosa:
In the back!

Mingle, but don't

Miss Chattoway,
I think you will be best served

17:26.041 --> 17:28.375
to stay by the stairs,
so as not to...

17:28.458 --> 17:29.917
overwhelm.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.750
Of course, all your "turns"
will be used to minimal effect.

17:33.834 --> 17:37.000
The mission is to amuse.
Not alarm.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.875
I know we'll make
a good impression.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.375
I have every faith.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.417
You'll also be wearing these.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.959
So people can comfortably
identify you.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.000
-Excuse me.
-Oh.

18:27.709 --> 18:30.917
Désirée:
And we'll need a room

18:32.208 --> 18:35.375
-I'm sorry, Miss...
-Désirée.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.709
Désirée Blodgett.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.291
I usually just go
by the first name,

Désirée, Diva of Desire.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.834
No? Well, I'm a whore.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.875
A bit renowned.
I've cultivated
an impressive clientèle.

18:51.959 --> 18:55.208
Especially given that
I'm not exactly Mitzi Dalti,
am I?

18:55.291 --> 18:57.208
(sighs) Men.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.375
They like talking to me.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.125
It's part of the job,
sure, listening,

19:01.208 --> 19:04.000
but last few years,
I get more and more clients.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.834
Men of stature. Real flash.

19:05.917 --> 19:09.000
And while we fuck--
Oh-- Nigel!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.834
Hat!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.959
Anyway, while we fuck,
they all gotta talk.

19:13.041 --> 19:16.625
You know? Things they done,
or want, or mean to do,

19:16.709 --> 19:18.834
and they ain't
exactly priests.
Well, a couple.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.959
But they feel so relieved
gettin' it all out.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.792
Except now,
they're not so relieved.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.000
Me hearing everything
from everyone.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.417
And yesternight, I find out
that one of me regulars--

19:29.500 --> 19:32.250
the sweetest little man--
is planning on having me killed.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.667
-How do you know?
-He told me.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.333
During.

19:36.417 --> 19:38.625
Crying so hard I thought
he was gonna propose.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.375
They do sometimes.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.542
And you have information
on these men?

19:43.625 --> 19:46.208
Oh, fuck, no.
I can't remember a word.

19:46.291 --> 19:49.792
I just need a place
for me and Nige
till the heat's come off.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.375
Who sent you?

19:54.458 --> 19:56.667
It's just, you're here
at a delicate time,

19:56.750 --> 19:59.125
and I'm curious
who said to come.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.625
Uh, my friend.
Well, he's a client.

20:02.709 --> 20:05.417
I mean, we all
talk about this place.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.917
Which client, exactly?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.291
I'd rather not say.

20:10.166 --> 20:12.667
And I don't remember?

20:12.750 --> 20:16.208
-Do they think I'm an idiot?
-(laughs) They?

20:16.291 --> 20:17.417
We've just been raided,

20:17.500 --> 20:20.250
and you come here
to get away from "the heat."

20:20.333 --> 20:22.417
It doesn't really
make sense, does it?

20:22.500 --> 20:24.458
Though these days, what does?
I am an idiot.

20:24.542 --> 20:27.041
I'm trying to find someone
the Beggar King can't trace

20:27.125 --> 20:29.208
by looking at fucking
street plans.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.583
I'm not from here.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.917
And everyone wants to see.
The cops,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.917
Bidlow's bridge cronies.
Now you.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.291
So friendly. On the run.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.041
The kid's a bit much,
but I like the commitment.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.417
And Maladie's got no idea
what Mary's "turn" can do.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.792
Mary is the voice
of the Galan--

20:47.125 --> 20:48.667
Oh.

20:48.750 --> 20:49.917
Huh.

20:50.834 --> 20:54.291
-It's not just men.
-No.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.166
I'm sorry,
you was very worked up,

20:56.250 --> 20:57.959
and that's when my "turn"
works on people.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.291
-When they're upset.
-Put on your coat.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.500
Oh, just a couple
of nights. Please.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.542
I forget everything,
personal guarantee,

21:04.625 --> 21:06.083
and Nigel don't speak ever.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.500

-Put on your coat.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.458
Why are you leaning on us?

21:20.542 --> 21:24.458
She was fucking Touched.
She was attacking us.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.333
She made me lonely.

21:26.417 --> 21:27.875
With her mind.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.917

21:38.542 --> 21:41.417
I'm off to drink lunch.
Come in.

21:42.709 --> 21:43.917
Mrs. True.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.166
I hope this means you have
something useful to say.

So, so you're the detective now?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.709
Yeah. All right. It's me.

22:10.792 --> 22:14.917
It's over.
It's half a year
since I seen her.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.709
The lads thought Maladie
might have taken Mary
'cause of me,

22:18.792 --> 22:20.709
-but--
-It wasn't you.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.917
But you still feel
responsible for Mary.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.709
Still have that picture.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.917
-Did she call it off?
-(laughs softly)

22:28.000 --> 22:30.959
What, you, you, you think
I'd tell you that?

22:31.041 --> 22:34.208
Just trot out me
personal affairs, yeah?

22:34.291 --> 22:36.166
What, give me a whack
'round the face,

22:36.250 --> 22:38.709
and I'll paint you a picture
of me last summer,

22:38.792 --> 22:42.709
standing at the altar with
a flower in me button hole,

22:42.792 --> 22:44.125
and no fucking bride.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.458
Mmm? Engaged for
more than a year.

22:46.542 --> 22:49.250
But she waits,
she waits till
me whole family's--

22:49.333 --> 22:51.834
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't you judge her, though.
(tutting)

22:51.917 --> 22:55.875
Don't you judge her.
Mary is a kind, caring woman.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.375
She's just...

22:57.458 --> 22:59.959
Oh, Christ, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't marry me, either.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.250
Yeah, she-- Mary knew.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.000
She knew the job
would take the toll,

23:03.083 --> 23:04.250
but there's worse things.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.000
-Yeah, there's things you--
-Stop.

23:07.166 --> 23:09.000
Please. Stop.

23:16.291 --> 23:17.834
(gun cocks)

23:19.333 --> 23:20.333
(exhales)

23:20.417 --> 23:21.917
Don't make me
take that away from you.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.083
Fuck did she just do to me?

23:24.166 --> 23:26.291
I'm going to find Maladie.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.542
I've seen it happening.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.417
What I don't know
is if I find her

23:29.500 --> 23:32.417
before or after Mary's dead.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.959
I needed to be sure you care
more about saving Mary

23:36.041 --> 23:37.417
than catching Maladie.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.542
'Cause I'll bet you that bullet
your orders say different.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.208
You Touched...

23:45.792 --> 23:50.125
You're worse than
the fucking toffs.

23:50.208 --> 23:54.083
-(gun clicks)
-The order is to eliminate
Maladie at any cost.

23:54.166 --> 23:58.250
No matter who gets hurt.
You win a bullet.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.917
Mary dies...
(sniffles)

24:01.000 --> 24:02.750
-(gun clicks)
-you win six.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.792
A song.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.625
That's Mary's "turn."

24:09.709 --> 24:12.542
A song only the Touched
can hear.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.375
What's it about?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.333
Hope.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.333
(train rumbling)

24:21.417 --> 24:23.250
I want to hear it.

24:23.333 --> 24:24.458
(chains rattling)

24:24.542 --> 24:28.000
You sang for Maladie.
Now sing for me.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.500
If you sing, and I hear it,

24:30.583 --> 24:33.417
it means I'm finally Touched.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.500
It means I'm worthy.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.208
I can't.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.875
And you're not.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.583
Oh, Miss High and Mighty.

24:43.667 --> 24:46.625
I'm working for my "turn."

24:47.583 --> 24:49.500
Sacrifice.

24:49.583 --> 24:50.959
You know?

24:52.834 --> 24:56.750
I sacrificed my little toe.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.583
(retching)

25:00.667 --> 25:03.250
-But that wasn't enough.
-(coughing)

25:03.333 --> 25:06.417
But every inch is
an inch closer to being...

25:06.500 --> 25:08.125
Clara and Colonel:
Gifted by God.

25:08.208 --> 25:11.875
Mmm. Chattering magpies,
while I do all the work.

25:11.959 --> 25:14.291
Well, as it happens,

25:14.375 --> 25:17.291
we did have some
turkey left over.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.417
None for me, Colonel?

25:22.959 --> 25:27.000
(Clara and Colonel
chuckling evilly)

25:27.083 --> 25:28.291
(shrieks)

25:28.375 --> 25:29.709
-Bonfire Annie: Hey!
-Aah!

25:29.792 --> 25:31.750
Maladie said not to play
with this one.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.709
She never said that.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.375
You're not a believer, anyway.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.083
You're just hired...

25:37.166 --> 25:39.125
Bonfire Annie.

25:41.333 --> 25:45.000
As it happens, Clara,
we're late for church.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.208
Clara:
You're lucky we're late
for church.

25:48.291 --> 25:50.041
-Are we late for church?
-Yes.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.083
Psst. Annie.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.000
We missed you.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.917
We've got the name.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.083
Mrs. Amalia True.
And the address.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.625
What good's an address?

26:04.709 --> 26:06.291
In terms of arson,
it's fairly crucial.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.750
Yeah, but I'm not
looking for her.
I'm looking for her.

26:08.834 --> 26:12.792
The entire of her.
The fuckin' soul, eh?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.750
Get me something I could
shake at her.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.166
A dolly. A pretty dolly.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.834
All of London looking for us,
and you want me to--

26:17.917 --> 26:20.125
Well, wear a fuckin' bonnet!

26:20.208 --> 26:23.208
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

26:23.291 --> 26:26.458
Don't be cross, eh?

26:26.542 --> 26:28.834
We'll do a proper job
after this, yeah?

26:28.917 --> 26:30.375
Yeah?

26:30.458 --> 26:33.000
I don't mind crazy, boss.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.709
I can't work with stupid.

26:36.709 --> 26:38.291
(sighs)

26:38.375 --> 26:39.875
(huffs)

26:46.834 --> 26:48.709
Oh...

26:48.792 --> 26:52.083
Now then... why'd you sing?

26:53.834 --> 26:55.291
I'm...

26:55.375 --> 26:56.959
-I'm not sure.
-T'other night.

26:57.041 --> 26:58.792
-Pretty ditty, eh?
-(grunts)

26:58.875 --> 27:00.083
Why?

27:01.417 --> 27:05.000
I was afraid more people
would get hurt.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.667
It comes when I'm afraid.
When I'm sad.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.542
The song. It...

27:10.500 --> 27:13.750
It... it helps.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.000
I knew that you would
hear it,

27:18.083 --> 27:20.500
and maybe...

27:20.583 --> 27:23.500
It might be a reassurance.

27:23.583 --> 27:29.125
A sense that you needn't
act only from pain.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.208
No. I just meant...

27:33.291 --> 27:36.583
have you always wanted
to be in the theater?

27:38.375 --> 27:40.083
(camera bulb pops)

27:40.166 --> 27:43.792
-(indistinct chatter)
-(lively violin music playing)

27:46.000 --> 27:47.166
(partygoers exclaiming)

27:47.250 --> 27:50.458
(applause and laughter)

28:01.709 --> 28:04.041
Primrose:
We had such
a lovely time there.

28:04.125 --> 28:06.667
Of course, my father is much
called away by his work.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.625
They're in Zurich
for the season.

28:08.709 --> 28:11.417
Your mother has found
a very cunning tailor, dear.

28:11.500 --> 28:15.208
Vernal lace.
Hard to find by the yard.

28:15.291 --> 28:17.083
Oh, it's not yards.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.291
Do we smile, or...

28:18.375 --> 28:20.041
(horrified gasp) perhaps?

28:20.125 --> 28:22.625
Don't be an ass, Carl.

28:22.709 --> 28:23.792
(pops)

28:25.166 --> 28:27.166
(indistinct chatter)

28:29.667 --> 28:30.875
Miss Adair.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.333
Mr. Bidlow.

28:33.417 --> 28:37.583
Miss Adair. Oh, no.
I, I just, I said that. Um...

28:37.667 --> 28:40.166
(chuckles)

28:40.250 --> 28:42.750
(exhales)
It's good of you to come.

28:42.834 --> 28:45.500
Excuse me. Uh,
Augustus Bidlow, Lucy Best.

28:45.583 --> 28:48.250
Augie. Very kind to meet you.

28:48.333 --> 28:50.500
It's a thrill, ain't it?
(sniffs, clears throat)

28:52.000 --> 28:55.375
(exhales)
It's... it's a lovely broach.

28:56.583 --> 28:57.959
Elephant.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.792
Penance made it for me.

28:59.875 --> 29:01.291
'Memorate my mum.

29:01.375 --> 29:04.417
She ran with the Forty Elephants
back in the day.

29:04.500 --> 29:05.792
The gang?

29:06.792 --> 29:08.625
Oh. How enterprising--

29:08.709 --> 29:12.041
-Did you have something you--
-Uh, uh... There--
There are some paintings

29:12.125 --> 29:14.041
-that I thought--
-From when I said how I like...

29:14.125 --> 29:16.333
-paintings.
-Paintings. Yes, yes.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.208
Uh, next room. Yes, yes.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.417
Toff.

29:29.458 --> 29:32.000
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Do you know Vickers Square?

29:32.083 --> 29:34.208
Why don't you try Italy?

29:42.250 --> 29:47.542
So... Should I be wearing
one of those ribbons?

29:47.625 --> 29:49.083
Should we?

29:50.166 --> 29:51.458
Hmm.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.083
Did you know?
Before the opera?

29:56.750 --> 29:59.417
Uh, not...

30:00.417 --> 30:04.417
I mean, I've had moments,
where...

30:06.417 --> 30:10.500
You see, I've always
been keen on birds, you know.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.375
Like, um, particularly corvids.

30:12.458 --> 30:15.959
That's crows and magpies
and jays.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.667
Do you know,
they are often overlooked,

30:17.750 --> 30:20.959
'cause people think
they're plain. Or, um...

30:22.792 --> 30:24.250
Sorry.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.250
I dreamt I was a crow.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.375
A few times.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.834
My, my, my wings out, just...

30:34.917 --> 30:37.291
soaring over the countryside.

30:40.583 --> 30:44.000
And then it happened
when I wasn't asleep.

30:44.083 --> 30:47.333
In, um... church.

30:47.417 --> 30:49.375
Oh, dear.

30:49.458 --> 30:52.875
-It was a very dull sermon.
-I get so mad when they're dull.

30:52.959 --> 30:55.333
You've got all the scripture
and you can't spin a tale.

30:55.417 --> 30:57.417
-Exactly.
-(both chuckle)

30:57.500 --> 31:00.083
Yes. But I...

31:00.166 --> 31:02.709
I didn't nod off. I just--
I was in the pew,

31:02.792 --> 31:05.667
and then suddenly
I was also in the sky.

31:05.750 --> 31:10.208
Just racing over hills
and forests, and...

31:10.291 --> 31:12.500
And I was controlling it.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.291
Left and right.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.583
Have you ever--
Sorry.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.083
Is that how it works?
I don't--

31:20.166 --> 31:22.959
Well, there's no two people
who have the same "turn." It--

31:23.041 --> 31:25.166
-(indistinct chatter outside)
-Right.

31:27.834 --> 31:29.333
But, um...

31:32.500 --> 31:35.083
It's a feminine trait, isn't it?

31:35.166 --> 31:37.417
Oh, there's men that have it.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.458
So where does it lead?

31:42.000 --> 31:47.125
What if I'm soaring about
every Sunday to come?

31:48.917 --> 31:51.417
What if it happens,

31:51.500 --> 31:53.041
and I can't come back?

31:53.125 --> 31:54.625
(snickers)

31:54.709 --> 31:56.250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.291
Um, I didn't, um...
I just thought

31:58.375 --> 32:00.250
if you're up there,
then pity the poor magpie

32:00.333 --> 32:02.875
that would be stuck listening
to that sermon.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.583
-Oh!
-(both laugh)

32:06.667 --> 32:08.917
-Oh, no. No.
-(laughing)

32:09.750 --> 32:12.458
Dear. So cruel. Poor bird.

32:12.542 --> 32:14.250
(laughs)

32:14.333 --> 32:15.500
I am a monster.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.166
You know you're not, though.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.291
I don't...

32:21.375 --> 32:24.000
-I mean, a person doesn't--
-How does it feel?

32:25.375 --> 32:26.709
To fly?

32:29.667 --> 32:31.667
It feels like flying.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.625
(indistinct chatter)

32:42.750 --> 32:46.166
(panting)

32:46.250 --> 32:49.500
Hey. You there. Girl.

32:49.583 --> 32:51.542
You one of them?

32:51.625 --> 32:54.166
Now you brush right off,
young man.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.583
Come on in.

32:58.291 --> 33:00.583
Aw, you've had a time of it,
haven't you?

33:00.667 --> 33:02.709
-We'll get you some tea.
-Thank you.

33:03.792 --> 33:05.458
-(growling)
-(screams)

33:05.542 --> 33:06.875
(heavy slam)

33:11.041 --> 33:13.583
Mary:
Well, I sang pretty much
anywhere. Um...

33:15.542 --> 33:18.542
But some of the pubs
were pretty grim.

33:18.625 --> 33:22.208
But this bloke said that
he'd put me on the stage, and...

33:22.291 --> 33:24.166
for once, that's what he meant.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.417
Yeah, but it's not workin' out.

33:27.291 --> 33:28.458
What?

33:28.542 --> 33:30.458
You're a little fuckin' old

33:30.542 --> 33:32.709
to be stuffed back
in the chorus.

33:32.792 --> 33:36.458
Brayin' in time with nine girls
nine years your junior.

33:37.291 --> 33:40.166
Eh? All... all this...

33:40.250 --> 33:43.333
And never the brio
to make yourself heard.

33:43.417 --> 33:45.041
What hobbled you?

33:45.125 --> 33:47.500
-Were you harvested early, eh?
-(grunts)

33:47.583 --> 33:49.583
Uncle or pastor
got you still green?

33:49.667 --> 33:52.959
Hey. There is many
a lass that never finds
her voice then...

33:53.041 --> 33:55.625
-What is it you're after?
-Thorns!

33:57.291 --> 34:00.000
All I see is a crown.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.500
God made me see.

34:08.291 --> 34:10.625
He made me remember
the day He came.

34:10.709 --> 34:12.834
Me alone.

34:12.917 --> 34:16.583
How He sent His angels
in their white smocks

34:16.667 --> 34:19.125
to unhouse my flesh.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.750
Teach me glorious pain.

34:21.834 --> 34:24.583
And I thought I'd been chosen
'cause I was special.

34:24.667 --> 34:28.000
My agony's made me special,
but you...

34:28.083 --> 34:30.000
You're nothing.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.709
You're pleasant,
and He fills your throat.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.583
Lets you make my pain little.

34:35.667 --> 34:39.333
-Don't you sing it!
-(groans) I can't. I can't. I--

34:40.542 --> 34:42.959
I can't feel it.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.583
God, He mocks me with that song.

34:45.667 --> 34:49.709
He mocks me, and He sends
a demon after me.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.208
Demon?

34:54.834 --> 34:57.834
The woman who sheds her skin.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.125
Oh, she's coming.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.792
She wants His song.

35:03.875 --> 35:07.291
But you don't.
So why don't...

35:07.375 --> 35:09.542
You could make her pay a ransom.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.959
Look, my, my family,
we have a little put by,

35:12.041 --> 35:14.000
and you, you would,
you would come out of it
with a profit--

35:14.083 --> 35:15.417
Then everyone gets
what they want?

35:15.500 --> 35:16.959
-(punches)
-(yells)

35:17.041 --> 35:20.083
(groaning)

35:20.166 --> 35:22.291
Maladie:
You fuckin' child.

35:22.375 --> 35:25.750
I don't want what I want.

35:25.834 --> 35:29.709
Go out in the world and show me
this magical symmetry.

35:29.792 --> 35:33.291
It's broken.
It's designed to be broken.

35:33.375 --> 35:37.458
Gears crushing gears.
He means for this to hurt.

35:37.542 --> 35:40.291
I don't know where
my song comes from.

35:44.583 --> 35:46.792
But God doesn't want us to hurt.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.208
They say you shit when you hang.

35:55.166 --> 35:57.583
Frank:
So, these ripplings.

35:57.667 --> 35:59.083
They let you see the future,

35:59.166 --> 36:03.291
but you can't control
when they come, or...

36:03.375 --> 36:06.375
-what you see, or why.
-(door closes)

36:06.458 --> 36:07.834
Every day's an adventure.

36:07.917 --> 36:10.875
Can you change it?
Can, can you...

36:10.959 --> 36:13.333
see the beach,
then go to the woods?

36:13.959 --> 36:15.875
No.

36:15.959 --> 36:18.417
So all you know is
you're punching Maladie.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.583
-Do you feel anything?
-(liquid pouring)

36:21.667 --> 36:26.500
Rage, or victory maybe,
or failure?

36:27.291 --> 36:29.166
Mostly I feel calm.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.792
I know where I am in a fight.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.333
It's one of the few times I do.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.875
I know what you mean.

36:35.959 --> 36:39.750
I don't get the part where
you know what you mean.

36:39.834 --> 36:43.083
I've had more experience
with violence

36:43.166 --> 36:45.000
than I would have liked.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.834
Your late husband?

36:48.333 --> 36:49.917
It doesn't--

36:50.000 --> 36:51.583
It's, it's not pertinent,

36:51.667 --> 36:54.083
unless it gives you
an understanding of Maladie

36:54.166 --> 36:55.417
we don't have.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.417
Well, it's clear she was abused.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
By a doctor, or doctors.

37:01.709 --> 37:03.667
And probably as a child,
as well.

37:04.917 --> 37:08.583
The confusion of pain
with pleasure...

37:08.667 --> 37:10.500
the fierce religiosity.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.500
Religious?

37:12.583 --> 37:14.709
Uh, this is beyond blasphemy.

37:14.792 --> 37:18.542
-She, she's mocking God.
-Amalia: No. She loves Him.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.333
Fears Him.

37:20.417 --> 37:23.375
Every powerful figure
who ever made her afraid,

37:23.458 --> 37:25.250
made her helpless--

37:25.333 --> 37:27.959
they're her understanding
of God.

37:28.041 --> 37:30.041
She'd do anything to please Him.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.250
How does Mary fit in?

37:35.250 --> 37:37.041
I don't think she does.

37:38.542 --> 37:41.792
Mary makes you feel love.
Feel loved.

37:41.875 --> 37:44.083
Which is terrifying.

37:44.166 --> 37:45.542
For someone who...

37:46.834 --> 37:48.709
Someone like her.

37:50.375 --> 37:54.834
Maladie felt a power
greater than pain.

37:57.166 --> 38:00.208
Do you think Mary
might cure her?

38:01.250 --> 38:03.166
Is it ever that simple?

38:05.709 --> 38:08.291
Penance:
You see, people think
the electricity is in the wire.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.583
But it's everywhere.
The air's thick with it,

38:10.667 --> 38:13.125
and it, it moves. It circles.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.667
And not just in the circuit,
but all across the air.

38:15.750 --> 38:16.875
It's like a murmuration.

38:16.959 --> 38:20.333
Um, a great horde of birds.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.250
They're all moving as one,
and then suddenly...

38:22.333 --> 38:24.083
-(makes whooshing sound)
-Oh, I've seen that!

38:24.166 --> 38:26.917
-Oh, I could watch for hours,
how they wheel about.
-Harriet: Penance?

38:27.792 --> 38:29.000
Miss Adair,

38:29.083 --> 38:32.166
some of the gentlemen
have begun wagering on...

38:32.250 --> 38:35.750
On whether Lucy can break
the statue of Aphrodite
in the garden.

38:35.834 --> 38:38.125
Oh, no, no.
Uh, please, I need to--

38:38.208 --> 38:40.542
No, of course. Go. Go, go, go.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.625
-Go. (chuckles)
-(laughs softly)

38:57.625 --> 39:01.375
Oh. Uh... you're in here.

39:01.458 --> 39:03.208
You were missed at the party.

39:03.291 --> 39:06.250
Oh, well, that would be a first.

39:06.333 --> 39:09.709
People saw you walking away
with Miss Adair.

39:09.792 --> 39:12.083
It was commented upon.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.709
But they're our guests.

39:14.792 --> 39:16.333
Lavinia:
No, they're not our guests.

39:16.417 --> 39:18.583
They are my charity.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.166
I brought them here
to help them.

39:20.250 --> 39:22.166
To prove that the Touched
are not a threat.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.709
Yet you seem determined
to prove that they are.

39:24.792 --> 39:27.208
Miss Adair is every inch a lady.

39:27.291 --> 39:28.208
She'd never overstep.

39:28.291 --> 39:30.000
Is it every inch then?

39:30.083 --> 39:31.667
(scoffs)

39:31.750 --> 39:34.458
You cannot complete a sentence
without exposing yourself.

39:34.542 --> 39:36.959
If the guests suspect
that Miss Adair

39:37.041 --> 39:40.083
has social ambitions,
or is using a "turn"

39:40.166 --> 39:43.250
to bewitch
a weak-minded bachelor,

39:43.333 --> 39:46.709
the reports of this event
could be disastrous for us,

39:46.792 --> 39:49.041
and possibly dangerous for her!

39:49.125 --> 39:53.333
(exhales)
You always assume
the worst of everybody.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.000
They seldom disappoint.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.458
I am at fault.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.834
You've been acting oddly
since the opera,

40:03.917 --> 40:05.417
and I failed to notice why.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.000
Well... all the murders...

40:09.083 --> 40:11.208
There is a path
that cannot be trodden.

40:12.417 --> 40:13.834
A private indiscretion
is one thing,

40:13.917 --> 40:16.792
but you are not clever enough
to keep a mistress.

40:16.875 --> 40:20.625
And we cannot have
a girl who is Touched,

40:20.709 --> 40:23.667
and Irish, bear the Bidlow name.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.625
If you regard Miss Adair,

40:28.709 --> 40:31.333
you must think more
of her reputation,

40:31.417 --> 40:34.250
and less of her...

40:34.333 --> 40:36.542
every inch.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.208
(pops)

40:43.125 --> 40:45.333
(popping)

40:45.417 --> 40:47.750
Lucy:
I'd never go about breaking
the Bidlow's precious things,

40:47.834 --> 40:49.125
even for 50 quid.

40:49.208 --> 40:50.667
You'd have to put it
up to a hundred.

40:50.750 --> 40:52.917
Oh, I don't think that's, um...

40:53.000 --> 40:54.375
Oh, um...

40:56.125 --> 40:57.667
There was never a danger.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.792
Just your friends having a joke.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.000
Yes.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.417
I, I did--
I did think of another,

41:03.500 --> 41:04.834
um, example of how
your blackbirds--

41:04.917 --> 41:07.083
Miss Adair,
I think we're all done.

41:07.959 --> 41:09.417
Sorry?

41:11.417 --> 41:13.709
Your girls.

41:13.792 --> 41:16.166
Everybody's seen
all your tricks, and...

41:16.250 --> 41:17.709
I think they'd like
to spend some time

41:17.792 --> 41:19.375
without the entertainment.

41:21.166 --> 41:22.542
Oh. Oh.

41:25.125 --> 41:27.917
I enjoyed our conversation,
but, um...

41:28.000 --> 41:31.917
I'm neglecting
my real friends,
so... excuse me.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.125

-Greta over there
can make both of her--

-She's... Touched.

48:24.166 --> 48:26.208

48:28.208 --> 48:29.375

the day of the opera--

Thank God you made me come.

Well, I'm certainly--

are a plague.

I woke up every morning
in their teeth that chewed me.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.917
Cut me.
Raped me into tiny bits
and then put me back

52:49.000 --> 52:50.959
and then ground me up
and then put me back.

52:51.041 --> 52:53.000

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:54.667
which is intended to demonstrate
to polite society

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.792
how presentable
and well-mannered

1:03:56.875 --> 1:03:59.166
-the Touched can be.
-(CERAMIC SHATTERS)

1:03:59.792 --> 1:04:01.041
(APPLAUSE)

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:02.917
It's this kind of charity

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.458
which is now considered
politically incorrect.

1:04:09.250 --> 1:04:10.667
ANNA DEVLIN:
Initially, the gala

1:04:10.750 --> 1:04:14.125
is to kind of try and integrate
the Touched

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:16.542
into the London social life.

1:04:16.959 --> 1:04:19.458
ANN SKELLY: There's not a lot
understood about the Touched,

1:04:19.542 --> 1:04:21.959
so I think there's a lot of fear
and ignorance

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:24.625
towards people who are Touched.

1:04:24.834 --> 1:04:28.291
The gala is to try and give
a feeling back to society

1:04:28.375 --> 1:04:30.291
that, whatever
they may have seen,

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:31.667
or whatever the papers
may be saying,

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:34.333
actually, these people are okay.

1:04:34.917 --> 1:04:38.542
Of course, all your turns
will be used to minimal effect.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.709
The mission is to amuse.

1:04:41.417 --> 1:04:43.125
You'll also be wearing these...

1:04:44.667 --> 1:04:46.500
so people can comfortably
identify you.

1:04:48.083 --> 1:04:50.917
KIRAN SONIA SAWAR:
As Touched people, some
of our powers aren't visible.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.250
-(GLASSY TINKLING)
-(AUDIENCE GASPING)

1:04:52.458 --> 1:04:53.625
Harriet's definitely not happy

1:04:53.709 --> 1:04:55.291
about having to wear
the ribbons.

1:04:55.375 --> 1:04:57.000
It's actually quite dark.

1:04:57.333 --> 1:05:00.041
OLIVIA WILLIAMS: All the women
just want to be normal,

1:05:00.125 --> 1:05:02.667
and want to be at a party
and wear a pretty dress

1:05:02.959 --> 1:05:05.291
and be considered normal parts
of society,

1:05:05.667 --> 1:05:09.083
and society insists
on compartmentalizing them

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:10.166
and separating them.

1:05:10.417 --> 1:05:12.417
SKELLY: I don't think they think
too much of it.

1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:14.875
It's just another way
of othering us.

1:05:15.083 --> 1:05:18.500
DEVLIN: They turn from people
into amusements.

1:05:18.750 --> 1:05:21.500
They're there to be funny now,
and not to be scary.

1:05:21.583 --> 1:05:22.834
You can wonder at them.

1:05:23.250 --> 1:05:25.959
Do we smile? Or-- (GASPS)
Perhaps?

1:05:26.417 --> 1:05:28.041
Don't be an ass, Carl.

1:05:28.125 --> 1:05:29.583
There's a lot of green-screen...

1:05:30.542 --> 1:05:32.041
in the making of Primrose.

1:05:32.333 --> 1:05:34.250
There's also a platform

1:05:34.333 --> 1:05:36.083
that I have to stand on
quite a lot of the time

1:05:36.166 --> 1:05:38.709
that actually brings me up
to Primrose height,

1:05:38.917 --> 1:05:42.208
but we also have
a Primrose doll,

1:05:42.291 --> 1:05:45.250
which is my exact proportions

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:46.875
but Primrose size.

1:05:47.166 --> 1:05:51.417
It's strange enough just to see
myself, like, in a picture,

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:54.250
but then to see a model
of myself, but double,

1:05:54.542 --> 1:05:56.542
is quite scary.

1:05:57.375 --> 1:05:58.917
JOHNNY HAN: So, to achieve
the Primrose effect,

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:02.208
we've got a whole bag
of different tricks.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:05.291
When she's getting photographed
at the party,

1:06:05.500 --> 1:06:08.500
we actually use two cameras
simultaneously,

1:06:08.583 --> 1:06:11.250
where we had one camera
as a master camera

1:06:11.458 --> 1:06:14.500
showing she's standing
against a staircase,

1:06:14.750 --> 1:06:17.959
and there're these spectators
who are taking a photo with her.

1:06:18.208 --> 1:06:20.917
And then, we have another camera
on Primrose,

1:06:21.375 --> 1:06:23.500
who is still standing there
in front of them,

1:06:23.583 --> 1:06:24.834
but she's at her normal height.

1:06:24.917 --> 1:06:28.583
But the second camera is half
the distance closer to her

1:06:28.667 --> 1:06:32.000
and half the height.
So, we have her on green screen,

1:06:32.083 --> 1:06:34.417
and then,
with our video mixing team,

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.458
in real time,
they're compositing it

1:06:36.542 --> 1:06:38.333
so that the director
and the DOP

1:06:38.417 --> 1:06:40.291
and all of us can watch
on monitors,

1:06:40.625 --> 1:06:43.667
seeing Primrose in real time,
looking like a giant

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:46.208
from camera one's point of view.

1:06:46.625 --> 1:06:47.792
I gotta hand it to Anna.

1:06:47.875 --> 1:06:51.834
She's amazing,
dealing with visual effects

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:54.834
and the process
that we put her through.

1:06:56.542 --> 1:06:59.125
-CREWMEMBER: And roll camera!
-CREWMEMBER 2: Rolling!

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:02.625
GEMMA JACKSON: The Bidlow Estate
is a pretty fabulous place
in its own right.

1:07:03.083 --> 1:07:05.375
What was really nice
about using West Wickham,

1:07:05.458 --> 1:07:06.500
which is where that one was,

1:07:06.834 --> 1:07:09.750
was that the lovely staircase,
it was perfect for Primrose

1:07:09.959 --> 1:07:11.542
and having the photographs
taken and everything.

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:12.959
It was just spot-on.

1:07:13.458 --> 1:07:16.542
The interiors of this place
are sort of legendary

1:07:16.625 --> 1:07:17.875
in architectural history.

1:07:18.125 --> 1:07:20.750
And then,
the sets were beautiful.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.083
The flowers, the food. I mean,
the heartbreaking thing is,

1:07:24.166 --> 1:07:26.792
you know, if you actually try
to eat any of this stuff,

1:07:26.875 --> 1:07:29.667
you'd be poisoned,
but it looked beautiful.

1:07:30.208 --> 1:07:34.417
The house lent itself to
some beautiful autumnal colors

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:38.417
of flowers, which we spiraled
around the marble columns

1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:40.291
and had climbing up
the stairway.

1:07:40.375 --> 1:07:42.417
JACKSON: We just went to town,
Tina and myself.

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:44.709
It just begs to be dressed,
really.

1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:47.417
CHRISTINE BLUNDELL:
All of the people
that went to the gala

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:50.709
basically had people at home
that would help curl their hair,

1:07:50.792 --> 1:07:52.125
but the girls
from the orphanage

1:07:52.208 --> 1:07:56.083
were styled pretty much how
they are on an everyday look.

1:07:56.166 --> 1:07:57.583
You know, they kind of all
help each other out

1:07:57.667 --> 1:07:59.625
with their hair and things.
We worked that out early on.

1:08:00.166 --> 1:08:02.583
MICHELE CLAPTON:
We had a lot of costumes
made for the Bidlow House,

1:08:02.667 --> 1:08:05.291
'cause I wanted the palette
to be so precise.

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:08.041
The class system was rife then
in Victorian times.

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:12.083
The best way to illustrate it
in some ways is palette.

1:08:12.333 --> 1:08:15.208
We wanted pale and beautiful,
not too sugary,

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:17.959
but sort of lovely
pale pistachios and peach,

1:08:18.041 --> 1:08:20.792
and just this lightness
and this beauty.

1:08:21.166 --> 1:08:24.250
Then, into that,
we bring the Touched,

1:08:24.583 --> 1:08:26.583
who look a bit drab
by comparison

1:08:27.125 --> 1:08:30.166
except for Penance,
who we wanted to make

1:08:30.417 --> 1:08:32.041
look rather pretty...

1:08:33.041 --> 1:08:35.500
but actually rather dated,
so her silhouette,

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:38.208
it's not really of the time.

1:08:38.291 --> 1:08:40.375
It's something that was
obviously handed down to her,

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:42.166
but she still look gorgeous.

1:08:42.792 --> 1:08:44.041
Did you have something you...

1:08:44.125 --> 1:08:45.083
Uh, uh-- yeah.

1:08:45.375 --> 1:08:47.000
There are some paintings
I thought that you would be--

1:08:47.083 --> 1:08:49.417
-From when I said
how I like paintings.
-Paintings. Yes.

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:53.375
TOM RILEY: Augie's most excited
to see Penance

1:08:53.750 --> 1:08:55.250
at the gala because

1:08:55.583 --> 1:08:59.208
not only was he very taken
with her at the opera,

1:08:59.291 --> 1:09:00.583
but in locking eyes with her

1:09:00.667 --> 1:09:03.291
at the very moment
that he realized he was Touched,

1:09:03.375 --> 1:09:06.375
she, too,
witnessed who he truly was.

1:09:06.834 --> 1:09:09.792
And she is very willing and open

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.125
and prepared
to hear his thoughts and listen,

1:09:13.208 --> 1:09:15.083
in a way that other people
won't listen to him.

1:09:15.166 --> 1:09:16.250
I am a monster.

1:09:16.709 --> 1:09:17.875
You know you're not, though.

1:09:17.959 --> 1:09:19.875
SKELLY: It is Penance's job
a lot of the time

1:09:19.959 --> 1:09:23.125
to help people understand,
what's happened to them

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:26.041
is okay, and it's actually--
can be a good thing.

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:28.959
But the one thing
that really surprises her

1:09:29.041 --> 1:09:31.709
is that they have
a mutual passion

1:09:31.792 --> 1:09:33.625
in different ways, like,
their turns come from

1:09:33.709 --> 1:09:35.875
a passion they have. Like,
she loves inventing things,

1:09:35.959 --> 1:09:38.709
and he loves, you know, birds,
and they really bond over that.

1:09:38.792 --> 1:09:41.458
So, I think Penance gets to step
out of the role of therapist,

1:09:41.667 --> 1:09:44.625
and they actually share more
than just, like, a little spark.

1:09:44.709 --> 1:09:45.792
Like a murmuration.

1:09:46.458 --> 1:09:48.667
Um... a great horde of birds...

1:09:49.083 --> 1:09:51.166
they're all moving as one,
and then suddenly,

1:09:52.250 --> 1:09:54.041
Oh, I've seen that.
Oh, I could watch for hours.

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:55.959
RILEY:
They're both able to nerd out

1:09:56.041 --> 1:09:58.250
and not feel judged at all
by the other one,

1:09:58.333 --> 1:10:00.542
and that's something that
Augie's never had before.

1:10:00.625 --> 1:10:04.166
And I think he feels seen
for the first time by her.

1:10:06.417 --> 1:10:07.667
You were missed at the party.

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:09.166
That would be a first.

1:10:09.792 --> 1:10:14.250
Lavinia's imperfect to her core,
and not only has she got

1:10:14.333 --> 1:10:17.750
very politically incorrect ideas
about difference and disability,

1:10:17.834 --> 1:10:20.208
she's also a snob,
and doesn't want

1:10:20.417 --> 1:10:22.583
her brother getting
romantically involved

1:10:22.667 --> 1:10:24.875
with someone
from a different class,

1:10:24.959 --> 1:10:27.125
never mind someone
who is Touched.

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:29.500
You always assume the worst
of everybody.

1:10:29.875 --> 1:10:31.000
They seldom disappoint.

1:10:32.834 --> 1:10:35.875
Lavinia's motivations,
as always, are very complicated,

1:10:36.625 --> 1:10:38.583
and it's meant
to be complicated.

1:10:38.667 --> 1:10:42.583
We want you to wonder, is she
trying to hurt the Touched,

1:10:42.667 --> 1:10:44.125
or is she trying to help them?

1:10:44.667 --> 1:10:47.291
How much does she know
about what's going on?

1:10:47.792 --> 1:10:50.000
At the end of this episode,
we learn that

1:10:50.083 --> 1:10:52.083
she knows some stuff
we didn't think she knew.

1:10:52.417 --> 1:10:55.583
We want you to be asking all
those questions about Lavinia.

1:10:56.792 --> 1:10:57.875
This is war.
