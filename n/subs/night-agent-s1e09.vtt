00:06.006 --> 00:07.841
[Peter] The FBI raided my house
when I was 16.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.926
They suspected my father.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.803
My daughter was kidnapped.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.389
<i>The Secret Service have identified</i>
<i>a person of interest.</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:18.643
His name is Peter Sutherland, Jr.

00:19.894 --> 00:20.729
[man] Hey!

00:22.439 --> 00:23.940
[ominous music playing]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.150
[Erik] Secret Service.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.818
-What's your relation to Peter?
-Godson.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.946
Peter's not someone who just kidnaps
the vice president's daughter.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.906
Remember the first time
I called Night Action?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.533
You told me to fight like hell,

00:33.616 --> 00:35.618
and that's what
I need you to do right now.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.788
There is no way
that I'm borrowing this now.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.498
It's just one night. It's fine.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.542
[Maddie screaming]

00:42.625 --> 00:44.210
Who are you? What is this all about?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.129
-Revenge.
-[Maddie] It's my dad, isn't it?

00:46.212 --> 00:48.131
I fucking hate my father.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.468
[Diane] If the kidnapper tells her,
even if we get her back safely, what then?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.470
-I can-- I can control her.
-Can you?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.847
Yes, as I always have.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.390
There's gonna be another attack.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.768
My aunt said there was only seven days
till it goes down.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.102
-[Diane] Valerie.
-Ma'am?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.772
We get bullet points
for the Omar Zadar briefing at three?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.190
POTUS said to skip this one.

01:05.273 --> 01:08.026
Between you and me,
I'm thinking of a personnel change.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.862
-Is that right?
-All that matters is finding Maddie.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.323
There is no boss, just partners.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.076
Worley worked as a security guard
for the past six months.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.746
All these companies have warehouses
within a mile of the D.C. Container Depot.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.956
He's holding Maddie
at the D.C. Container Depot.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.459
Tell me where Peter Sutherland is.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.587
I'll make you a deal.
I know who Maddie Redfield's kidnapper is.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.590
You take care of him,
and I'll locate Sutherland for you.

01:30.673 --> 01:31.674
[Maddie panting]

01:36.054 --> 01:37.180

01:39.057 --> 01:40.558
-[gun firing]
-[Erik grunting]

01:41.267 --> 01:42.143
[Rose] Hey!

01:48.233 --> 01:49.150
[music fades]

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
[ominous music playing]

01:57.450 --> 01:59.619
[anchor] <i>Police and federal agents</i>

01:59.702 --> 02:01.579
<i>as a potential terrorist attack.</i>

02:01.663 --> 02:03.623
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>I can see a number of ambulances</i>

Yeah?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.426
[Valerie] <i>Willett and Hawkins</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:16.678

-I'm five minutes away. Don't--
-[phone beeping]

02:18.721 --> 02:20.014
Hold on a sec.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.141
Hello?

02:21.224 --> 02:22.767
[Redfield] <i>We need to talk, Diane.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:24.727
Whatever you wanna bitch about
can wait, Ashley.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.147
I don't know if you heard,
but the country was just attacked.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.190
[Redfield] <i>That's what</i>
<i>I wanna talk to you about.</i>

02:39.617 --> 02:40.952
-[Diane] Where is he?
-[man] Ma'am.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.330
All right, I'm here. Start talking.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.667
Diane, this is Gordon Wick.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.085
I know who he is.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.379
What the fuck did you two do?

02:53.548 --> 02:55.049
[Redfield] It had to be done.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.345
In what world did you have to bomb
a metro car full of American citizens

02:59.429 --> 03:02.348
to assassinate a foreign politician
on U.S. soil?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.393
The courthouse explosions in 2014,

03:05.476 --> 03:07.937
the bus attacks in 2016.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.065
Omar Zadar can deny
his involvement all he wants,

03:11.149 --> 03:12.859
but we know he's a terrorist.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.028
That's what they called Mandela
once upon a time.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.613
Believe me, he's no Mandela.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.282
Better than the maniac
they currently have in power there.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.367
That maniac is the devil we know.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.204
You mean the devil who pays you
billions in military contracts.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.414
This is more than just business.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.958
We have 50 warheads stationed in country.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.961
What happens if Zadar
seizes those weapons?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.047
What then?

03:34.130 --> 03:37.008
I tried to talk sense into the president,
she wouldn't listen.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.009
We had to try.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.928
Why are you telling me all this?

03:40.011 --> 03:42.388
Because mistakes were made,
and if there's an investigation--

03:42.472 --> 03:44.724
Of course there's going to be
an investigation.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.976
And if it uncovers our involvement,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.437
the whole administration is in jeopardy,

03:50.230 --> 03:51.522
especially the president.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.237
Over my dead body, you motherfucker!

03:57.320 --> 04:00.031
Travers' plans for energy,
trade, the Jobs Act…

04:00.823 --> 04:01.866
it's all dead.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.078
If every single one
of her administration is subpoenaed

04:05.161 --> 04:07.872
and dragged to the Hill to testify--

04:07.956 --> 04:10.959
You're trying to use
my loyalty to POTUS to save yourself.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.711
-No, no, to save us all, Diane.
-[tense music playing]

04:14.212 --> 04:17.507
Think about it.
If my head rolls, so does Michelle's.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.050
So does yours.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.302
That's why we need you now.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.017
I need a minute… alone.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.894
Of course.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.355
That's fine. We'll step out.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.692
Take all the time you need.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.193
[door opening]

04:44.033 --> 04:45.326

[breath shuddering]

05:04.053 --> 05:05.054
[Diane sniffling]

05:15.523 --> 05:17.525
[Diane] Here's what we're gonna do.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.361
[opening theme music playing]

05:54.437 --> 05:56.981
[Rose groaning]

05:59.567 --> 06:01.235

[cell phone vibrating]

06:10.661 --> 06:12.663
[suspenseful music playing]

06:14.916 --> 06:16.376
-[Rose] Peter.
-[Peter] Yeah.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.753
-You okay?
-[Rose] Yeah.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.962
[cell phone vibrating]

06:20.713 --> 06:21.631
Yeah?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.591
You found my guy yet?

06:23.674 --> 06:24.550
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.135
[Gordon]<i> Really? And the girl?</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:27.220
Yeah, her too.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.805
[Gordon] <i>So, what did you do?</i>

06:29.597 --> 06:31.224
I did what you asked.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.101
Oh, great work.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.728
Get to the safe house ASAP.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.357
Yeah, uh, send me the location.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.400
You should have it.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.610
Uh, my partner handled that stuff.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.153
Your partner?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.197
Right.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.990
What's his name again?

06:52.161 --> 06:53.162
[cell phone beeping]

06:53.246 --> 06:55.164
Fuck. Who was that?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.082
I don't know.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.667
[sirens wailing in distance]

06:57.750 --> 06:59.752
-Hey, come on. We gotta go.
-[Rose] Okay.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.465
Arrington! Hey, we have to go right now.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.551
What? No, I'm not leaving.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.594
My partner was just-- Fuck.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.472
Did my father really do
everything that guy accused him of?

07:11.556 --> 07:12.598
What did he tell you?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.725
He said that Dad
was behind the metro bombing,

07:14.809 --> 07:17.645
and that he tried to cover it up,
and that he killed his brother.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.564
-Is that all true?
-He's involved, yeah.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.400
-Why?
-He was trying to kill Omar Zadar.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.110
When he failed, he blamed it on Zadar.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.154
But your father's
not the only one involved.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.781
It's Diane Farr and a military contractor.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.325
Yeah, Gordon Wick.
He's bankrolled my dad for years.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.703
-We have to go, now.
-I'm not leaving him.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.246
They're preparing another attack.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.040
We have less than 24 hours to stop it.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.710
And if we don't, if we get caught now,
more people are gonna die.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.669
I can't.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.296
Well, I could help.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.048
If I'm rescued,
the president will wanna see me,

07:46.132 --> 07:48.426
so will Almora, Director Willett.

07:48.968 --> 07:49.886
Can I trust them?

07:49.969 --> 07:52.847
Travers, yes. Willett, no idea,

07:52.930 --> 07:55.183
but Almora, I'd, uh, I'd stay away from.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.102
No, Erik trusted Almora.
They used to be partners.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.645
He might be our best bet.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.106
Didn't seem like there was
any love lost between him and Farr.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.568
What if I can get a message
to the president or Mr. Almora

08:05.651 --> 08:08.321
and tell them about my dad, about Farr.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.157
You'd need proof they were involved,
something undeniable.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.118
I found this on the shooter.
Maybe there's something on here.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.870
Okay, they're gonna take my phone.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.372
-No comms until I text you first.
-[Peter] Got it.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.582
I'll explain everything.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.708
Okay?

08:20.791 --> 08:23.586
But for now, you didn't see those two.
You sent me the video.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.880
Erik and I cracked your code,
came looking for you.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.924
-Just the two of us, okay?
-Okay.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.176
Over here! Come on.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.055
It's gonna be okay. Here. Hey, here.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.556
[Maddie crying]

08:38.100 --> 08:39.393
[intense music playing]

08:39.477 --> 08:41.062
[police sirens wailing]

08:51.072 --> 08:53.115
What does undeniable evidence
even look like?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.576
No idea, but I know someone who might.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.039
If it wasn't her on the phone, who was it?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.792
-I don't know.
-[Diane] Okay.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.044
All right. Thank you.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.547
[Diane breathing deeply]

09:07.630 --> 09:09.006
That was Director Willett.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.384
FBI was informed by local P.D.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.178
about shots fired
at the D.C. Container Depot.

09:14.262 --> 09:18.975
They found Maddie and her lead agent,
Chelsea Arrington, alive.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.103
Anything else?

09:22.186 --> 09:23.104
[Diane] Three dead.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.606
The kidnapper,
a male Secret Service agent,

09:25.690 --> 09:27.441
and an unidentified female.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.485
Sorry for your loss.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.029
Maybe it was Arrington
that picked up the phone?

09:32.113 --> 09:33.698
This is a clusterfuck.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.535
[door closing]

09:38.327 --> 09:40.371
Where are you with tomorrow morning?

09:41.205 --> 09:42.123
Good to go.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.543
Zadar's plane lands at 0400
at Joint Base Andrews.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.297
The car will be all set to go.
He'll no longer be a problem.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.841
I need confirmation as soon as it's done.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.719
I can't deal with any more
of your fuckups, Gordon.

09:54.802 --> 09:57.096
[scoffing] 'Cause you're too busy
dealing with your own?

09:57.179 --> 09:58.264
Meaning what?

09:58.347 --> 10:01.267
How are things going in the West Wing
with your pal, Michelle?

10:01.350 --> 10:02.893
-You told him?
-I--

10:04.103 --> 10:05.855
POTUS has her hackles raised.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.107
What's gonna happen
when she starts questioning you?

10:08.190 --> 10:09.775
You let me worry about POTUS.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.319
You let me worry about Zadar.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.403
Enough.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.364
What are we gonna do about Maddie?

10:16.532 --> 10:19.660
We need to figure out exactly
what she and Arrington know,

10:19.744 --> 10:20.911
what they believe.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.872
I'll ride shotgun on Arrington's debrief.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.206
You talk to your daughter.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.958
-Figure out where her head's at.
-Okay.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.252
We'll regroup and figure out
the best way forward.

10:28.336 --> 10:32.632
Open lines of communication
between the three of us lock-fucking-step.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.675

[door opening]

10:44.143 --> 10:44.977
[door closing]

10:45.061 --> 10:49.148
If Diane can't keep POTUS in check,
then she's lost all utility.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.901
[doorbell ringing]

10:52.443 --> 10:53.486
Just a second.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.363
[stove clicking]

11:03.746 --> 11:06.374
Uncle Jim. I know…
I know it's been a while, but, uh,

11:07.583 --> 11:08.417
we need help.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.629
-This is--
-Rose Larkin.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.924
Heard it on the news.
Why don't you come inside?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.342
Come on.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.720
-Head downstairs.
-Thanks.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.351
[lock clicking]

11:32.316 --> 11:33.567
Make yourselves at home.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.864
-Thanks so much for taking us in.
-Not at all.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.951
You guys look like you could use
a doctor, or maybe a shower.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.285
Oh God, yes.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.328
I'll get some towels.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.540
I thought only law enforcement
had phone hackers like that.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.042
I ran a cybersecurity startup.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.002
It was part of my severance package.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.839
[keyboard clacking]

11:56.090 --> 11:57.717
-[Jim] Here you go.
-Thanks.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.636
-Thank you.
-[Jim] The nice shower's upstairs.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.013
-Down the hall and then--
-Last door on the right.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.057
Thanks so much.

12:10.354 --> 12:14.734
So why does the entire world think
my godson kidnapped Maddie Redfield?

12:16.485 --> 12:18.028
[dramatic music playing]

12:18.112 --> 12:19.905
[indistinct police radio chatter]

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
[EMT] There you go. That should hold it.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.288
-Thank you.
-[EMT] You're welcome.

12:32.084 --> 12:32.960
Here.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.966
It was smart of you.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.801
On the video.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.347
We wouldn't have found you otherwise.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
I'm so sorry.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.609
Look at me.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.196
This isn't on you, okay?

13:00.279 --> 13:02.531
I shouldn't have ditched you.
He'd still be alive.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.950
It's not your fault.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.119
[Nathan] Arrington?

13:08.245 --> 13:10.164
Briggs. Where's Almora?

13:10.247 --> 13:13.083
Out of town.
POTUS pulled him on something last-minute.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.004
Miss Redfield, I can't tell you
how relieved we all are

13:17.087 --> 13:18.422
to see you alive and well.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.549
-I need to talk to Almora.
-Absolutely.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.511
But first things first. Gun, badge, phone.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.517
You'll get them back
once you finish your after-action.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.603
Both of you, please follow me.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.272
The VP wants to see his daughter ASAP.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.819
They set up a medical bed
and a team of doctors in the residence.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.570
[Chelsea] And the after-action?

13:41.654 --> 13:44.156
[Nathan] Willett and Farr
have asked to sit in on the debrief.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.449
They're gonna meet us there.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.245
Eager to get you home safe, ma'am.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.040
[tense music playing]

13:58.921 --> 14:00.089
This is everything, right?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.382
Yeah.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.717
It's, uh, circumstantial.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.053
Who else figured out
that it was Rose's aunt and uncle

14:06.136 --> 14:08.180
that were the agents
investigating the metro bombing?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.349
-Who else could've sent the killers?
-Peter.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.102
Look, all we gotta do
is get someone to believe in us.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.938
Someone with enough power
to stop this next attack.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.856
[Jim] I believe you.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.024
I don't know that you have enough
to convince somebody

14:19.108 --> 14:21.527
who wasn't in the hospital waiting room
the day you were born.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.948
What you need are Diane Farr
or the VP's fingerprints on a crime.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.743
Uh, you expecting company?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.871
I wouldn't blame you
if you called the cops on me.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.790
Peter, I know you didn't kidnap that girl.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.042
Everybody else
seems pretty damn sure of it.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.461
-They don't know you like I do.
-Well, you knew my dad.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.589
-You didn't believe him.
-Don't.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.173
You wrote an article on him.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.385
-"My best friend, the traitor."
-I didn't choose that headline.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.263
Look, I'm a writer.
Writing is how I process the world.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.306
No, that's shit.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.058
You didn't have to process
your doubts in print.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.477
People believed you,
and you should've believed him.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.562
[Jim] Listen to me.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.482
You were barely a kid when your mom died,
and a teenager when he died.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734
So what?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.445
You never got to the stage
where you could see your parents' flaws.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.239
I knew your father. He had plenty of them.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.076
I wish I could believe
in his innocence like you do.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.164
When I find out the truth about my dad,
and I give it to you,

15:15.247 --> 15:16.749
I hope you have the balls to print it.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.959
Nothing could make me happier.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
Because maybe then you would realize

15:21.045 --> 15:23.714
that the people who actually
care about you, who love you,

15:23.797 --> 15:26.175
don't give a shit
about whether or not he was innocent,

15:26.258 --> 15:27.176
and they never have.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.261
[knocking on wall]

15:29.345 --> 15:32.681
Um, I cracked the phone.
I might have found something.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.766
Great.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.684
[Jim sighing]

15:38.771 --> 15:40.606
[contemplative music playing]

15:41.857 --> 15:44.360
-You wanna talk about it?
-Not really. What do you got?

15:49.239 --> 15:52.368
Okay. The phone was
practically empty at first,

15:52.451 --> 15:55.371
but I managed to restore
her deleted texts and photos.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.915
-I almost forgot how good I am at this.
-[keyboard clacking]

15:58.415 --> 16:00.125
[Rose] I found these.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.336
That's your aunt.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.423
Yeah, my uncle's in there too,
along with their code names.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.967
I also found these.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
That's the Night Action binder.

16:10.135 --> 16:14.181
And there's photos of dozens
of different pages sorted by code name.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.684
I'm assuming that each
belonged to a different night agent.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.355
Wait, wait, wait, these were taken
in the Night Action room.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.273
Do you have a date and time on this?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.651
Um, hold on.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.820
Metadata, here we come.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.905
-Okay…
-[keyboard clacking]

16:29.989 --> 16:32.366
January 9th, 2:37 a.m.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.244
No, that's… that can't be right.
That's my shift.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.704
Wait, uh…

16:38.539 --> 16:40.791
I called in sick that day, actually.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.752
I had food poisoning.
Farr said she'd find a replacement for me.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.714
Okay, well,
who else had access to this room?

16:47.381 --> 16:51.343
Other than me, just two other
phone operators, Farr and Hawkins.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.929
Can we confirm
that Farr took these photos?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.181
We could look
at the White House access logs, yeah.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.101
Basically, any time a badge is scanned
to get into the Night Action room,

16:59.184 --> 17:01.353
it's recorded,
so hers would be on there too.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.481
Well, Farr might have tampered
with the records already.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.151
No, 'cause you can request the logs
from Secret Service,

17:07.234 --> 17:10.195
but the only person who can
manually change the data is Almora.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.573
-Can Chelsea access them?
-[Peter] Maybe.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.534
I don't know. But who knows
the next time she'll try to contact us?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.994
We can't wait for her.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.204
We have to find somebody else
to request the logs.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.999
Preferably someone
that doesn't wanna shoot me on sight.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.709
Kind of narrows down the list.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.920
[crickets chirping]

17:32.217 --> 17:33.218
[cell phone chiming]

17:33.802 --> 17:34.845
Oh, jeez.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.723
My ride's gonna be here any minute.
You have to go.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.726
-I hate to put you out.
<i>-</i>No, no, no, I get it, okay?

17:40.809 --> 17:42.352
I'll head down to the news desk,

17:42.436 --> 17:44.354
start corroborating
everything you've given me.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.482
You find out anything else,
send it my way.

17:47.066 --> 17:47.900
Will do.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.735
Thank you.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.323
[dramatic music playing]

17:56.617 --> 17:58.619
-Keep him safe.
-It's kind of my job now.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.748
[car engine starting]

18:22.476 --> 18:24.728
[Chelsea crying]

18:28.899 --> 18:31.985
[Chelsea sniffling, sobbing]

18:51.380 --> 18:53.841
[door opening, closing]

19:04.351 --> 19:07.396
So no President Travers, no Almora.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.480
What's plan C?

19:09.189 --> 19:13.110
Last time Omar Zadar was in the country,
POTUS gave him a Secret Service detail.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.529
So if he is the target
for tomorrow's attack,

19:15.612 --> 19:16.947
that means he's back in the U.S.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.533
Then she would give him
Secret Service protection again.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.994
I can look up where his detail is,
warn his agents.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.162
I need a phone though.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.164
Don't think I'm getting mine back tonight.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.208
I have an old cell
in a box in the basement.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.710
-We can grab--
-[knocking on door]

19:32.671 --> 19:34.798
You feeling better
now that you're settled?

19:34.882 --> 19:35.799
Yeah.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.177
-It's good to be home.
-[Redfield] Yeah.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.345
You really had me worried.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.930
[unsettling music playing]

19:42.014 --> 19:45.475
Arrington,
Willett and Farr are waiting downstairs.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.770
Does she have to go? I…

19:49.479 --> 19:51.190
I feel safer when she's here.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.483
You're as safe now
as you're ever gonna be,

19:53.984 --> 19:55.861
and I'd like some time just you and me.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.780
I'll be back in a bit.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.257
Let's start.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.016
[Redfield] Did he say why
he did all this to you?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.018
You mean you didn't get the videos?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.102
What videos?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.439
He filmed me a couple times.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.736
Made me accuse you of ridiculous things,
read his demands.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.822
He said he sent them to you.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.742
Maddie, I never got any videos.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.120
If I had, I would have done
whatever he asked.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.289
Anything to get you back.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.419
What did he say about me?

20:56.046 --> 20:59.716
He said you were involved
in the metro bombing last year.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.636
That you killed his brother.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.513
It didn't really make sense.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.597
[Redfield scoffing]

21:06.098 --> 21:10.644
FBI's already pieced together some really
disturbing intel about this guy.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.396
Former military,

21:12.479 --> 21:14.106
history of drug abuse,

21:14.606 --> 21:16.900
his twin brother died last year.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.488
Sounds like it triggered
some kind of psychotic break.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.782
He was really troubled.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.200
Delusional.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.289
Look…

21:31.290 --> 21:33.500
I know I haven't been a perfect father,

21:34.251 --> 21:38.297
or even a… good father.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.508
But this was a wake-up call.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.052
You're all I have left.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.346
My only family.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.641
I love you…

21:50.684 --> 21:52.477
[sniffling] …so much.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.981
I don't know what I would have done if…

21:56.064 --> 21:57.566
I love you too, Dad.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.318
[ominous music playing]

22:11.038 --> 22:12.456
[both chuckling lightly]

22:16.418 --> 22:17.753
[Chelsea] I returned fire.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.797
One of my rounds hit close to the shooter
causing her to lose balance.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.342
She fell over the side
of the loading tower.

22:24.259 --> 22:28.096
When I finally checked on Agent Monks,
he wasn't breathing.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.974
Local police arrived moments later.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.020
I'd like to return
to this video you received

22:35.103 --> 22:37.189
from Miss Redfield on your phone.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.066
The one with the coded message.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.401
What was she saying in this video?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.154
She was accusing her father

22:44.237 --> 22:46.865
of being involved
with the metro bombing from last year.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.993
This kidnapper sounds unhinged.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.662
Still, I'd be curious
to take a look at that.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.997
Nathan?

22:54.081 --> 22:56.041
We'll pull that from Arrington's phone.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.501
Get that to you ASAP.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.378
And what about Peter Sutherland?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.505
What about him?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.924
He's been our primary suspect
in this kidnapping.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.467
An accomplice maybe.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.054
-Any sign of him at the container yard?
-[Chelsea] No.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.390
Maybe you're wrong
about his involvement in all this.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.142
We don't know what we don't know yet.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.937
[Willett clearing throat]

23:17.938 --> 23:19.398
Anything else you'd like to add?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.609
That's all for now then. Thank you.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.613
[tense music playing]

23:27.656 --> 23:28.698
Director Willett,

23:29.699 --> 23:32.160
any headway on Hawkins
or Campbell murders?

23:32.244 --> 23:35.080
Nothing.
Between those two cases and Maddie's,

23:35.163 --> 23:36.832
the whole agency's running on empty.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.376
Now I gotta pull people
to analyze this video.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.546
That's a priority?
This Worley guy sounds delusional.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.341
Colin Worley was on a long list
of suspects in the metro bombing

23:46.425 --> 23:47.801
before we thought he died.

23:47.884 --> 23:48.844
Seriously?

23:48.927 --> 23:51.555
[Willett] I'm interested in anything
he had to say on the matter,

23:51.638 --> 23:52.931
delusional or not.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.863
Lights are still off.
I don't see her car, so…

24:08.363 --> 24:09.906
Give her another 30 minutes.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.748
Hey, you okay?

24:19.833 --> 24:21.042
Yeah, it's nothing.

24:23.378 --> 24:24.504
I don't know, this…

24:25.005 --> 24:27.632
this attack, whatever it is,

24:27.716 --> 24:29.384
it happens tomorrow, right?

24:29.468 --> 24:30.886
Yeah, we think so.

24:31.470 --> 24:35.682
Well, that means 24 hours from now,
it's all gonna be over.

24:36.933 --> 24:40.729
And either we stop it,
or probably gonna get arrested,

24:41.521 --> 24:42.481
or killed.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.442
After we stop it,

24:45.942 --> 24:47.110
what next?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.155
After all the debriefs,

24:51.198 --> 24:52.782
the interviews…

24:52.866 --> 24:55.577
After the conspiracy freaks stalk us.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.536
[Peter chuckling]

24:58.955 --> 25:00.248
After the funerals.

25:03.752 --> 25:04.628
Yeah.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.172
Yeah, after all that.

25:09.090 --> 25:09.966
I don't know.

25:12.469 --> 25:16.473
Well, actually, the first thing I'll do
is take a five-day-long nap.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.267
[both laughing]

25:19.351 --> 25:21.520
Yeah. Yeah, a nap sounds nice.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.479
[Rose] Mmm.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.523
What about after that?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.151
I think I wanna go back.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.529
To California.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.739
I wanna try again.

25:32.822 --> 25:33.907
With your company?

25:34.658 --> 25:35.659
Yeah, well…

25:37.244 --> 25:39.412
New name, new start. [sighing]

25:40.247 --> 25:41.623
Learn from my mistakes.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.668
What about you? Back to Night Action?

25:44.751 --> 25:46.753
[scoffing] No. Fuck no.

25:46.836 --> 25:47.754
[both laughing]

25:47.837 --> 25:49.589
I think one call was enough.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.675
[chuckling] Yeah.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.010
[Peter] I don't know, I…

25:55.303 --> 25:58.265
I think I wanna buy a cabin,
disappear for a bit.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.183
Sounds nice. Where?

26:00.684 --> 26:01.643
[Peter] No idea.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.438
But I hear California's great.

26:09.317 --> 26:10.944
[car approaching]

26:11.611 --> 26:12.571
[Peter] That's her.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.491
[car door opening]

26:16.575 --> 26:17.951
[tense music playing]

26:27.669 --> 26:28.503
[Peter] Go.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.214
[suspenseful music playing]

26:45.312 --> 26:46.146
[Peter] Val.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.480
-Hey.
-Peter, what the fuck?

26:47.564 --> 26:49.316
-Let me explain.
-[Rose] Stop!

26:49.983 --> 26:52.402
From here on,
you do what we fucking tell you.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.653
What?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.780
-I was just moving things along.
-Don't.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.532
Take us up to your place.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.659
Go, come on.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.544
[drawers clattering]

27:12.172 --> 27:13.965
There, sent.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.091
How long will it take?

27:15.592 --> 27:16.468
I don't know.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.471
Hey, there's confidential information
on there.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.431
-I'm counting on it.
-Valerie, let's go.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.725
-Seriously?
-[Peter] Yeah, I'm serious. Come on.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.728
[Valerie's breath shuddering]

27:30.148 --> 27:32.567
Look, I don't have time
to explain right now,

27:32.651 --> 27:34.361
but we're doing the right thing.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.029
-Really?
-[Peter] Yes.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.489
I know how it looks…

27:38.907 --> 27:40.116
but Farr is up to something.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.203
She's the chief of staff.
She's always up to something.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.331
She was behind Rose's aunt and uncle
getting murdered, Val.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.415
Based on what?

27:48.833 --> 27:52.379
You ever think that maybe
you're on the wrong side of this, Peter?

27:59.094 --> 28:00.387
I'm… I'm sorry.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.097
No, don't-- [moaning]

28:05.600 --> 28:06.434
No response?

28:07.268 --> 28:08.937
Not yet, but I found this.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.023
An email from Valerie
to the president's secretary.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.527
Travers disinvited Farr
from a briefing about Omar Zadar today.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.113
Valerie was emailing to figure out why.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.407
-And?
-She never got a reply.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.498
-Hey, Arrington.
-Hey. I need my gun and badge.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.500
Did Briggs authorize that?

28:30.583 --> 28:32.585
He said I'd get them back
after my debrief, so…

28:32.669 --> 28:34.462
Let me just check with him.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.964
Thanks. Take your time.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.262
[mouse clicking]

28:45.682 --> 28:47.183
Where are you, Almora?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.191
What?

29:00.488 --> 29:02.031
Camp David?

29:09.122 --> 29:10.999
[Nathan] It's fine, I'll talk to her.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.298
Arrington.

29:19.007 --> 29:22.635
Hey, just trying to get my gun and badge.
I'd like to get back to guarding Badger.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.638
Right, uh, about that. I talked to Almora.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.932
He said to wait
until he's had a chance to talk to you.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.894
He's busy handing something for POTUS.
He'll be back tomorrow.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.273
You talked to him?
You tell him about Erik?

29:35.356 --> 29:37.859
Yeah. Yeah, he was pretty devastated.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.611
It's a tragedy.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.780
Monks was a great agent.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.866
And even better guy.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.326
[Nathan] Hmm.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.250
[knocking on door]

29:56.211 --> 29:57.462
[Diane] We gotta talk.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.256
[Redfield sighing]

30:37.418 --> 30:38.253
What'd she say?

30:38.837 --> 30:41.214
She said she didn't buy
what he was feeding her.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.634
-And you believe her?
-Not entirely, but she'll be fine.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.595
How about Arrington?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.222
She knows more than she's saying.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.099
And not to add to our problems,

30:51.182 --> 30:54.853
but Willett's already drawn the connection
between Worley and the metro bombing.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.062
[Redfield sighing]

30:56.145 --> 30:57.063
I'll handle it.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.440
How?

30:59.524 --> 31:00.859
Have you even talked to POTUS

31:00.942 --> 31:03.111
after she dropped you
on the Zadar briefing?

31:04.195 --> 31:05.947
We just need to delay a little longer.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.533
Once you guys deal with Zadar,

31:08.616 --> 31:10.952
I'll use the distraction
to handle Arrington and Maddie--

31:11.035 --> 31:13.288
-I said Maddie's fine.
-I know what you said.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.999
I also know you were ready
to confess on national TV,

31:16.082 --> 31:18.334
so you'll excuse me
if I take your assessment

31:18.418 --> 31:19.878
with a giant bucket of salt.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.380
Once POTUS hears Maddie's been found,

31:22.463 --> 31:24.674
she's gonna wanna meet
with her and Arrington.

31:24.757 --> 31:27.760
If either of them says something
they shouldn't, we're all fucked.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.973
I'm sure you understand, Ashley,
why that's just not an option for us.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.898
Let's circle back after tonight.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.608
[Redfield] Mm-hmm.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.528
Have Wick call me
after he's done with Zadar.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.617
I'll be at the White House
to handle the fallout.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.662
[door opening]

31:55.788 --> 31:57.415
[tense music playing]

31:58.416 --> 32:01.252
[Redfield] I hear you about Diane
no longer being useful,

32:01.336 --> 32:03.004
so I'm in,

32:03.671 --> 32:04.839
on one condition.

32:06.424 --> 32:10.011
I'm sorry, Gordon, but this
is the only way you get my cooperation.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.179
She's my daughter.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.139
Yeah, I'll…

32:14.766 --> 32:16.434
I'll get her in line afterward.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.479
What about Sutherland and the niece?

32:19.562 --> 32:21.689
Uh, what if they've told someone?

32:24.734 --> 32:25.610
I guess.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.070
Worst-case,

32:27.987 --> 32:30.990
by tomorrow night,
I can issue pardons all around.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.368
[tense music playing]

32:34.535 --> 32:35.453
[Redfield] Yeah.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.978
[sinister music playing]

33:30.466 --> 33:32.260
Sorry, sir.
Didn't realize you were in here.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.302
That's fine.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.847
Thank you for bringing her back.

33:35.930 --> 33:36.764
Of course.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.891
Just doing my job.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.478
Sir?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.313
POTUS is on the phone.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.068
Keep an eye on her, will you?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.368
[door closing]

33:57.910 --> 33:58.995
Get what you needed?

34:02.623 --> 34:04.625
-You?
-Yeah.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.335
Let's just hope someone listens.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.004
-[Rose] Peter?
-Yeah.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.714
We got the access logs.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.799
[suspenseful music playing]

34:12.800 --> 34:14.510
Six, seven, eight…

34:15.553 --> 34:18.681
Here we go. January 9th, 2:35 a.m.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.559
It was her badge.

34:21.642 --> 34:22.810
It was Farr.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.687
She took the photos
of the Night Action binder.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.981
-That's undeniable.
-Send that to Jim.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.608
-[cell phone vibrating]
-I'm on it.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.485
-[Peter] <i>Hello?</i>
-Peter?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.695
-[Peter] <i>Yeah. Yeah, you two safe?</i>
-We're alive.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.155
We're safe, not so sure.

34:34.238 --> 34:35.281
What about you?

34:35.364 --> 34:38.326
We found information that links Farr
to the murder of Rose's aunt and uncle.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.410
[Chelsea] <i>Holy shit.</i>

34:39.494 --> 34:42.622
I'll send it to you when we hang up.
You talked to POTUS or Almora yet?

34:42.705 --> 34:44.832
They're out of town until tomorrow,
last-minute trip,

34:44.916 --> 34:46.793
and I can't get Almora on his phone.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.504
<i>-What about Zadar's detail?</i>
-The schedule puts him at Blair House.

34:49.587 --> 34:53.216
I called, Blair House says there's
no plans to have anyone there this week.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.717
-Where is he?
<i>-They wouldn't say.</i>

34:54.801 --> 34:56.260
Where else would they be keeping him?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.261
<i>The White House or…</i>

34:59.013 --> 35:00.223
Camp David.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.893
The president's last-minute trip.
She must be meeting Zadar there.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.437
But why wouldn't they update it
on Zadar's schedule?

35:06.521 --> 35:08.314
To hide it from Farr, maybe?

35:08.397 --> 35:09.232
[Chelsea] <i>What?</i>

35:09.315 --> 35:10.274
[Rose] I found an email.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.402
Farr was disinvited to a briefing
about Omar Zadar today.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.696
Maybe POTUS was suspicious about Farr,

35:15.780 --> 35:18.199
moved the location of their meeting
without telling her.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.284
Why would Travers think
that Zadar was in danger?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.245
[Chelsea] <i>Almora must've put</i>
<i>two and two together</i>

35:22.328 --> 35:23.746
when you came to campus asking about

35:23.830 --> 35:25.706
who I was guarding
the day of the metro bombing.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.168
Okay, then maybe Farr and Redfield
have called off the next attack.

35:29.252 --> 35:32.505
They wouldn't seriously be trying
to kill Zadar at Camp David, right?

35:32.588 --> 35:34.132
Not while the president's there.

35:35.424 --> 35:36.676
Maybe they would.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.927
What?

35:38.010 --> 35:40.263
[Maddie] I heard my father on the phone
a few minutes ago.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.975
He made a comment
about pardoning people tomorrow night.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.478
Only the president can issue pardons.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.605
Shit. They're not only trying
to take out Zadar,

35:49.689 --> 35:51.232
they're trying to kill the president.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.734
-[Chelsea] Send me the evidence.
-[Peter] <i>Yeah, keep me posted.</i>

35:53.818 --> 35:55.403
How do we stop this?

35:56.445 --> 35:58.906
There's only one person I know
that can call this off.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.491
Pretty sure Val has a key to her house.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.498
[Ben] <i>You've reached Ben Almora.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

36:07.582 --> 36:09.250
Going straight to voicemail.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.252
[door knob rattling]

36:11.335 --> 36:12.753
[knocking on door]

36:13.754 --> 36:15.214
[Chelsea] Coming. One second.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.260
[Redfield] Oh.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.304
Good, you're awake.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.640
-We have to go.
<i>-</i>Go where?

36:24.724 --> 36:28.686
Camp David.
President wants to see you… and you.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.771
[unsettling music playing]

36:51.500 --> 36:53.502
[intense suspenseful music playing]

37:15.149 --> 37:16.943
[woman] Mr. Zadar, Secret Service.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.319
Hope you had a good flight.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.528
How far is Camp David?

37:19.612 --> 37:20.988
Just under an hour.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.658
If you'll just follow me, sir.
Osprey's on the move.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.043
All set.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.380
[car engine stalling]

37:37.964 --> 37:39.632
[car chiming]

37:42.593 --> 37:45.054
[car engine stalling]

37:45.930 --> 37:47.473
Everything all right?

37:47.556 --> 37:49.934
[car engine stalling]

37:50.601 --> 37:52.687
[suspenseful music swelling]

37:55.398 --> 37:56.816
[car engine starting]

37:57.858 --> 37:59.068
[sighing]

38:48.784 --> 38:49.952
[Redfield sighing]

38:51.245 --> 38:52.288
[Redfield] Hey, sweetie.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.219
I've never seen those agents before.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.975
[helicopter engine whirring]

39:22.443 --> 39:23.944
[door creaking open]

39:26.781 --> 39:27.656
[Diane sighing]

39:34.372 --> 39:36.082
[keypad beeping]

39:36.165 --> 39:37.208
[lock clicking]

39:55.726 --> 39:58.479
When you see Wick,
tell him I had this message for him.

39:58.562 --> 39:59.647
[Peter] Tell him yourself.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.109
I don't take orders
from you anymore. It's over.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.320
We have evidence that you were involved
in the murder of my aunt and uncle.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.238
Really?

40:07.321 --> 40:09.740
Geotagged photos
of the Night Action binder that you took,

40:09.824 --> 40:11.992
and login records of when you took them.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.036
All the proof is with<i> The Baltimore Sun</i>.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.122
If this is all true,
why are you here, Peter?

40:16.205 --> 40:17.331
To gloat?

40:17.832 --> 40:19.875
It's not a good look.
It doesn't reek of confidence.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.711
Contact Redfield and Wick,
tell them to call off the assassination.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.256
You've come to the wrong person.
I don't know what's happening.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.424
Stop lying.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.800
We know everything.

40:27.883 --> 40:30.719
That you, Redfield, and Wick
were behind the metro bombing,

40:30.803 --> 40:33.514
and that all three of you are planning
on covering up your involvement

40:33.597 --> 40:36.225
by killing Zadar and the president
at Camp David.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.394
-What?
-Call it off.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.854
What are you talking about?

40:39.937 --> 40:41.021
Drop the fucking act.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.066
I'm serious. Why do you think
they're targeting Michelle?

40:44.150 --> 40:46.861
Maddie overheard her father talking about
issuing presidential pardons.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.362
-When?
-A few hours ago.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.615
Redfield and Wick
haven't answered my calls.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.910
Jesus, I thought you two were
Wick's assassins coming to kill me.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.455
-God.
-Who are you calling?

40:57.538 --> 41:00.207
The president. Who the fuck else?
I have to warn her.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.333
[phone line ringing]

41:01.417 --> 41:02.751
[operator] <i>You have reached--</i>

41:02.835 --> 41:05.296
Shit, they must have cut off
communications.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.047
-It's already in motion.
-What is?

41:07.798 --> 41:08.632
Talk.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.678
The attack on Zadar was supposed to happen
this morning when his plane landed,

41:12.761 --> 41:14.013
but it didn't go off.

41:14.096 --> 41:17.475
Redfield and Wick have frozen me out
because they've changed course.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.227
They've pivoted to Michelle without me.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.187
Why?

41:21.270 --> 41:24.315
They knew this is where I'd draw the line,
that I wouldn't allow it.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.276
I would never hurt Michelle Travers.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.361
Everything I've done,

41:29.445 --> 41:31.864
has been to help her,
help this administration,

41:31.947 --> 41:33.157
this country to succeed.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.492
[Peter] Save it.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.076
Help us stop it.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.787
Peter, don't let her fool you again.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.372
Peter.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.876
We're going to Camp David.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.503
[suspenseful music swelling]

41:47.129 --> 41:48.380
You're getting us in.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.007
[music fades]

41:51.091 --> 41:52.801
[ending theme music playing]
