The Spirit Pearl
and the Demon Pill.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.775
The Demon Pill is dangerous
and nearly indestructible.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.411
I'm casting a heaven-made curse,

will seek out and destroy it

04:42.283 --> 04:44.283

04:44.285 --> 04:46.752
Until that day,
you must stay vigilant

04:46.754 --> 04:48.587
and watch over it.

04:48.589 --> 04:52.624
Li Jing has won my favor

04:52.626 --> 04:55.027
And so, the Spirit Pearl

is successfully reincarnated,

then you shall join me

-in the Court of Heaven.

Dear, you should worship too.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.642

Why didn't I think of that?

06:17.644 --> 06:19.678
I've only been pregnant
for three years!

06:54.448 --> 06:56.915
I'll be a matchmaker

We wrote him a song.
Wanna hear it?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.486

07:01.488 --> 07:04.890
Thank you for your concern
and well-wishes, my friends.

Master Immortal,
I have something for you...

07:27.581 --> 07:29.981
I can't drink now.
That'd be so unprofessional.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.550
I'll just leave it here.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.852
I have important things to do.
Take it away.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.920
Hey.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.988
Ah, some people
just don't listen.

would be able to move it.

-He's what?
-I guess we'll have to do it

08:36.250 --> 08:37.749
the hard way.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.917
-[inhales deeply]
-Now hold on.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.751
We can't just go beating up

And if you're wrong
a fifth time?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.277
It locks itself

you can just verify
with a handprint.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.001
-[clinks]
-[whimpering]

13:26.006 --> 13:28.373
-[baby Ne Zha grunting]
-Take this, you little demon!

13:28.375 --> 13:29.841
-That's my son!
-No.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.810
That's the reincarnation
of the Demon Pill

13:31.812 --> 13:33.378
-and he's bad news!
-[wailing]

13:33.379 --> 13:34.945
If he didn't have
the Qiankun Hoop containing him,

13:34.948 --> 13:37.315
he'd unleash a reign of terror
like the world's never seen.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.517
[growling, screams]

13:42.122 --> 13:43.922
Go back where you belong!

13:43.924 --> 13:45.123
-[Lady Yin] No!
-[Taiyi grunting]

13:46.893 --> 13:48.526
[groans, exhales]

13:48.528 --> 13:49.928
My love!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.897
Please don't hurt him.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.532
Don't hurt my child!

13:54.534 --> 13:55.600
But...

13:55.602 --> 13:57.268
[Old Man] Lord Li!

13:57.270 --> 14:00.905
For generations
we have battled against demons.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.474
Do you think it wise
to endanger our people

14:03.476 --> 14:05.610
by letting one live among us?

14:05.612 --> 14:08.046
As the leader of Chentang Pass,

14:08.048 --> 14:10.515
I hope you can consider
the greater good

14:10.517 --> 14:12.517
and do what's right.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.953
He's over there.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.454
YOU HAVE A SON!

14:16.456 --> 14:18.256
MY CONDOLENCES

14:18.258 --> 14:20.158
[grunting, chomps]

14:20.160 --> 14:21.492
You see that?

14:21.494 --> 14:24.028
I'm here. Don't be scared.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.500
[coos]

14:30.403 --> 14:32.637
[calm music]

14:36.309 --> 14:38.409
[baby Ne Zha coos]

14:38.411 --> 14:40.979
Your Grace. Everyone...

14:40.981 --> 14:44.082
My family is unfortunate.
This I know.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.251
[Li Jing] But my son
is also just a victim

14:46.253 --> 14:48.336
of this misfortune.

14:48.337 --> 14:50.420
And I'm not of the mind
to kill an innocent child.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.557
I will take care
of Ne Zha's education,

14:52.559 --> 14:55.260
and I promise he won't set foot
in the village.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.961
If he brings you any harm,

14:56.963 --> 14:59.030
then I will receive
your punishment.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.666
I'm willing to pay
the ultimate price.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.135
[sighs]
Even if we spare him.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.603
He'll only have three years.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.972
The Supreme Lord
put a curse on the Pill

15:07.974 --> 15:09.440
so three years from today,

15:09.442 --> 15:12.310
a lightning bolt will strike him
and take his life.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.612
-[gasps]
-Oh.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.948
His curse can't be broken.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.317
I'll convince him
to have it removed.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.953
Don't worry. my darling.
I will protect our child.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.689
[sobbing]

15:29.562 --> 15:32.063
[cooing]

15:32.966 --> 15:34.465
[baby Ne Zha blabbers]

15:38.038 --> 15:40.104
[waves crashing]

15:45.178 --> 15:47.245
[splashes]

15:55.722 --> 15:57.989
[ominous music]

16:17.177 --> 16:18.710
Finally...

16:20.447 --> 16:23.681
[Dragon King]
This is the Spirit Pearl?

16:23.683 --> 16:26.684
If I infuse it into an egg...

16:26.686 --> 16:30.755
That means my son
will be all-powerful.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.991
Unstoppable.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.727
And my child will become a god?

16:35.729 --> 16:38.062
[stutters]
You'll never...

16:38.064 --> 16:40.431
-Never what?
-Fail, sir!

16:42.102 --> 16:44.702
Oh, very well.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.507
[growling]

16:54.180 --> 16:56.447
[chiming]

17:01.154 --> 17:03.654
[cracking]

17:03.656 --> 17:06.457
[Dragon King]
This is my son, Ao Bing.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.193
As agreed,
I will entrust him to you

17:09.194 --> 17:11.061
and he shall call you master.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.263
On the condition
you help free him

17:13.266 --> 17:16.467
from this underwater purgatory.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.103
And he joins Heaven's Court.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.071
-I can't...
-You can't?

17:21.074 --> 17:23.473
[stutters]
...can't be defeated.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.108
I'm going to prove to you

17:25.111 --> 17:28.413
that you've put your trust
in the most worthy immortal.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.416
Next time...

17:31.418 --> 17:34.685
Could you do me a favor
and just nod?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.623
[wings fluttering]

17:41.728 --> 17:44.262
[Taiyi] That right there
is a void portal.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.198
The Supreme Lord entered
a realm beyond the three worlds,

17:47.200 --> 17:49.767
so this door is the only way
we can get to him.

17:51.538 --> 17:55.573
Supreme Lord! It is I!
Your disciple, Taiyi.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.109
[Chang imitating Supreme Lord]
Taiyi, do you understand

17:58.111 --> 17:59.410
what you've done?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.296
Yes, I know I messed up

18:01.297 --> 18:03.181
but it's not really my fault
because there was a demon and--

18:03.183 --> 18:05.550
[Chang imitating Supreme Lord]
Ah! No excuses!

18:05.552 --> 18:07.418
What took you so long to see me?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.754
I get so bored by myself.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.422
Ah! It's just you.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.623
This is Chang ShengYun.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.358
He's in charge
of the void portal.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.194
But we just call him
Clingy Cloud.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.762
Oh, yeah?
Well, we call you fatty!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.681
Hello, new friend.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.599
Not in front of company.
Treat me with some respect!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.451
And this is Li Jing,

18:23.452 --> 18:25.302
-Commander of Chengtang Pass.
-A pleasure! Really!

18:25.305 --> 18:27.638
It's a party! I have company!

18:27.640 --> 18:31.209
[Chang] Oh, yes, sit, sit!
Here, have some tea.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.845
It's hard sitting here
guarding the gate every day.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.480
So what's new with the mortals?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.248
I've been out of the loop
for so long.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.117
Please relay
to the Supreme Lord.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.485
We seek an audience with him.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.120
Huh? I'm sorry but...

18:42.122 --> 18:44.889
Unfortunately, our master
and some of his god pals

18:44.891 --> 18:46.390
went to the void portal.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.426
Probably attending
to godly matters.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.461
But why do you want to see him?
Do tell, do tell.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.330
Someone's under
a heaven-made curse,

18:52.332 --> 18:53.531
and I want him to call it off.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.700
[gasps]
Say it ain't so!

18:55.702 --> 18:57.301
Then it's useless
to speak to him.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.736
That curse is unbreakable.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.837
[gasps]

19:03.443 --> 19:04.876
[Li Jing exhales deeply]

19:06.479 --> 19:08.679
One day here is a year there.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.214
Which means back on earth,

19:10.216 --> 19:12.383
a great deal of time
has already passed.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.452
We need to head back
as soon as possible.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.687
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.724
[somber music]

19:25.665 --> 19:27.498
[Ne Zha grunts]

19:27.499 --> 19:29.332
[Ne Zha] These dumb walls
crush my soul.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.404
Even prisoners get parole.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.540
No friends, no fun,

19:35.542 --> 19:37.808
it's just the worst.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.678
Hopefully boredom
will get me first.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.548
Ne Zha.
What're you doing up there?

19:43.550 --> 19:46.284
Can't go outside
and nobody will play with me.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.187
So what else can I do
but check out the sights?

19:50.557 --> 19:52.090
Then-- Oh!

19:52.091 --> 19:53.624
Why don't you describe
the scenery to mommy?

19:53.626 --> 19:56.327
Grass, trees, and dumb flowers.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.962
And a guy showing his butt.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.964
Oh, you with your jokes.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.899
Hey. Why don't I play with you?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.534
Don't mess with me.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.937
You don't have more demons
to fight or something?

20:05.939 --> 20:08.773
This is the first time
I've seen you in forever.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.908
You never have time to play.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.278
I know. I know this is hard.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.414
I would love to play more, baby,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.449
however the fortress
needs protecting.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.384
I can't be everywhere at once.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.485
Uh...

20:21.487 --> 20:23.454
But today has been peaceful.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.756
How does playing jianzi
sound to you?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.425
[grunts, spits]

20:27.427 --> 20:30.628
Well since you're so bored
I guess I can play with you.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.797
[both gasp]

20:33.833 --> 20:35.666
[grunting]

20:35.668 --> 20:36.968
Ready? Go!

20:37.937 --> 20:39.704
[grunting]

20:41.774 --> 20:44.709
[grunting continues]

20:44.711 --> 20:47.545
Milady. I think you should
put your armor on.

20:47.547 --> 20:48.713
You must be joking.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.281
He is my son and we're playing.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.916
Nobody's died from jianzi.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.551
Catch...

20:53.553 --> 20:54.619
[grunts]
...this!

20:54.621 --> 20:56.287
Ready--
[grunts]

20:57.857 --> 20:59.523
Uh, you okay, ma?

20:59.525 --> 21:01.392
I'm fine! I'm fine!

21:01.394 --> 21:02.627
Good shot!

21:03.363 --> 21:04.629
On second thought...

21:04.631 --> 21:06.397
Did I kick it too hard?

21:06.399 --> 21:09.267
No. Kick as hard as you want!

21:09.269 --> 21:11.035
-You two, join in.
-[both gasp]

21:11.804 --> 21:13.004
[thuds]

21:15.541 --> 21:17.375
[thudding continues]

21:19.379 --> 21:21.545
[sighs, panting]

21:22.715 --> 21:24.649
[soldier] Maybe you should rest.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.285
No. I'm alright.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.689
[Lady Yin] Look at how much fun
Ne Zha's having.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.527
It's been a long time since
he smiled like that.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.497
[both] That's wonderful
for him, milady.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.634
[scout] Report!

21:42.635 --> 21:44.302
An eel spirit's destroying
the eastern fishing village.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.369
We need reinforcements.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.871
-Mom, catch!
-[gasps]

21:50.410 --> 21:51.976
[chuckles]

21:56.516 --> 21:58.049
Sweetie...

21:58.051 --> 21:59.717
[Lady Yin] We're going to
have to call it a day.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.553
But next time...

22:02.555 --> 22:04.689
We can play as long as you want.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.691
I promise.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.693
-[gasps]
-That's what you said last time.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.695
[Ne Zha] It's fine.
I'm used to it by now.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.596
[Lady Yin] I'll cook
your favorite when I come home!

22:21.708 --> 22:22.907
[whooshes]

22:24.644 --> 22:27.044
[somber music]

22:39.792 --> 22:41.859
-[both snoring]
-[clatters]

22:41.861 --> 22:42.993
-Huh?
-Huh?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.764
[both chuckling]

22:50.069 --> 22:51.702
[Lady Yin] And you two.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.637
Master Immortal Taiyi
brought you here

22:53.639 --> 22:54.705
to protect the barrier,

22:54.707 --> 22:56.707
not so you can
be flashy mascots.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.410
Do not allow him
to get out anymore.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.612
Don't worry.
I guarded the southern boundary.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.647
And it's his fault
Ne Zha got out last time.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.751
You are so f-full of it!
The north was secured.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.919
He's clearly guilty.
Just look at this guy!

23:08.921 --> 23:11.155
Huh?
You turn that finger around!

23:11.157 --> 23:13.924
Once Taiyi Zhenren returns,
you just wait!

23:13.926 --> 23:16.427
Cause I'm sure
he loves to hear you whine!

23:16.429 --> 23:19.063
That's it! Fight me.
Come on, you wanna go?

23:19.065 --> 23:21.432
-Bring it! I ain't scared!
-Oh, yeah, chicken?

23:21.434 --> 23:23.033
-Chicken? You are!
-Ah!

23:23.035 --> 23:25.102
-[both grunting]
-Cut it--

23:25.104 --> 23:26.837
-I'll show you a chicken.
-Who's the chicken?

23:26.839 --> 23:28.939
-Chicken says "what?"
-[imitating chicken noise]

23:28.941 --> 23:30.508
-Huh?
-Huh?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.977
[both grunt]

23:40.119 --> 23:41.519
-[rock clinks]
-Huh?

23:41.521 --> 23:43.421
[growls]

23:43.423 --> 23:46.457
Huh? What? Whatcha lookin' at?

23:46.459 --> 23:47.925
-[scoffs]
-Huh?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.662
[snarls]

23:54.967 --> 23:57.668
-[rock clanks]
-[growling]

23:57.670 --> 23:59.570
[grunts]
What's the big idea--

23:59.572 --> 24:00.838
[both grunting]

24:01.808 --> 24:03.541
[grunting continues]

24:03.543 --> 24:04.675
Body Slam!

24:04.677 --> 24:06.677
[both grunting]

24:07.914 --> 24:09.046
-[clatters]
-Dragon Whip!

24:09.048 --> 24:10.681
Crabby Sea Monster!

24:10.683 --> 24:11.816
[both groan]

24:11.818 --> 24:13.117
Immortal Picking Grapes!

24:15.655 --> 24:17.154
Come on, Dad!
[chuckles]

24:17.156 --> 24:19.156
[indistinct chatter]

24:19.158 --> 24:21.192
-[Ne Zha] One!
-Huh?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.929
Two!
[Ne Zha chuckles]

24:24.931 --> 24:26.864
[shrieks]
He's out again!

24:26.866 --> 24:28.632
[whimpering]

24:30.536 --> 24:32.036
[crowd clamoring]

24:32.038 --> 24:33.904
[Ne Zha] Three!

-[Ne Zha] Four!

24:37.944 --> 24:39.710
-Five.
-[grunts]

24:40.880 --> 24:42.680
[Ne Zha] Six!

24:44.050 --> 24:45.950
Seven!

24:45.952 --> 24:47.885
-[gasps]
-[Ne Zha] Eight.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.654
Nine!

24:52.492 --> 24:53.557
Ten.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.759
Ready or not...

24:56.863 --> 24:58.796
[all whimpering]

-[groaning]

25:29.595 --> 25:31.128
[whimpers]

25:33.099 --> 25:34.632
Huh?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.800
[chuckles]

25:39.272 --> 25:40.704
-[thuds]
-[groans]

25:46.245 --> 25:47.611
[boy 1] I've had enough.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.764
Let's fight.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.916
But boss. There's no way
we can beat Ne Zha.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.901
Not true!

25:53.902 --> 25:55.885
Are we, or are we not
The Demonhunters Gang?

25:55.888 --> 25:57.321
Until we can figure out a way...

25:57.323 --> 25:59.590
no one goes home!

25:59.592 --> 26:00.858
-[thudding]
-[all] Huh?

26:03.963 --> 26:05.329
I have a way, boss!

26:05.331 --> 26:07.298
Huh? I told you to keep guard.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.117
Go back.

26:09.118 --> 26:10.935
I was thinking
we could set some traps.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.103
Like what?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.972
Check this out!

26:14.974 --> 26:16.907
[masked boy] <i> Ne Zha's gonna</i>
<i> come down that bridge,</i>

26:16.909 --> 26:18.676
<i> but he won't know I</i>
<i> cut the ropes...</i>

26:18.678 --> 26:19.944
-<i> And bam!</i>
-Ah!

26:19.946 --> 26:21.145
[masked boy]
<i> When he hits the ground,</i>

26:21.147 --> 26:23.464
<i> it'll trigger the second trap,</i>

26:23.465 --> 26:25.782
<i> an overhead basket filled</i>
<i> with sharp pointy objects!</i>

26:25.785 --> 26:27.451
-[screaming]
-[masked boy] <i> He'll reach</i>

26:27.452 --> 26:29.118
<i> for the nearest shield,</i>
<i> which will be an old pan.</i>

26:29.121 --> 26:30.638
<i> But surprise!</i>

26:30.639 --> 26:32.156
<i> There's another trap</i>
<i> within that trap!</i>

26:32.992 --> 26:34.681
[screams]

26:34.682 --> 26:36.371
[masked boy]
<i> He'll run and run and run...</i>

26:36.372 --> 26:38.061
<i> And "What's that?</i>
<i> A safe space to hide?"</i>

26:38.064 --> 26:39.997
<i> But not so fast...</i>

26:39.999 --> 26:42.132
-<i> Lift-off!</i>
-[Ne Zha screaming]

26:42.134 --> 26:43.517
[masked boy] <i> Boom!</i>

26:43.518 --> 26:44.901
-<i> But better watch out...</i>
-[groans]

26:44.904 --> 26:46.971
<i> for that venomous snake!</i>

26:46.973 --> 26:50.074
<i> And he'll start climbing</i>
<i> the rope ladder near the tree.</i>

26:50.076 --> 26:51.809
<i> Which should make</i>
<i> all those hornets</i>

26:51.811 --> 26:54.645
<i>in the hornet's nest I put there</i>
<i> really mad.</i>

26:54.647 --> 26:55.930
-[buzzing]
-[screaming]

26:55.931 --> 26:57.214
<i>[masked boy]If he doesn't want</i>
<i> to get stung so bad</i>

26:57.216 --> 26:58.916
<i>his head swells like a balloon,</i>

26:58.918 --> 27:00.851
<i> he'll have to jump</i>
<i> into the mud pit.</i>

27:00.853 --> 27:03.454
<i>And when he finally crawls out,</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:06.056
<i> he'll be so scared and angry</i>
<i>smoke will come out of his ears.</i>

27:06.058 --> 27:08.258
Nice! I never noticed
how clever you were.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.328
I'd have to be smart to hang out
with someone like you.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.830
[laughing]

27:12.832 --> 27:14.398
You know, when you're right,
you're right.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.667
But he needs
something way worse.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.236
I got it, let's add some sea
urchins to the pit!

27:19.238 --> 27:20.654
That'll do the trick.

27:20.655 --> 27:22.071
[boy 1] It's important for him
to stay hydrated.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.674
[all laugh]

27:23.676 --> 27:26.877
Um, guys?
You don't think that's too mean?

27:26.879 --> 27:28.846
Huh? He's mean.

27:28.848 --> 27:29.947
He humiliates us so

27:29.949 --> 27:31.048
-we're just returning the favor.
-Yes.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.950
-Yeah. That's right!
-Yeah. Exactly.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.786
All right. Well you're the boss.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.187
Who am I to disagree?

27:37.189 --> 27:40.324
Hold on. I just had
an important thought.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.760
-What is it?
-If our plan starts with Ne Zha

27:42.762 --> 27:44.662
on the bridge,
how do we get him there?

27:44.664 --> 27:46.096
That part's easy.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.765
We can scare him onto it.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.066
-Huh?
-Like how?

27:49.702 --> 27:52.069
Like...
[shouts]

27:52.071 --> 27:54.238
[boys screaming]

27:57.743 --> 28:00.144
[upbeat music]

-[splashes]

28:14.060 --> 28:15.693
[all sigh, gasp]

28:15.695 --> 28:18.929
[laughing]

28:18.931 --> 28:20.964
You were right about one thing.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.434
It's important to stay hydrated!

28:23.436 --> 28:25.736
You guys! You guys!

28:25.738 --> 28:26.804
-He beat me up.
-Huh?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.439
And he took all my clothes!

28:28.441 --> 28:30.941
Well fellas, it's been real.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.443
You guys are a lot of fun.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.445
Yeah? Laugh all you want.

28:34.447 --> 28:35.979
You demon!

28:38.350 --> 28:41.351
What did you just call me?

28:41.353 --> 28:42.953
-I said...
-[boys gasp]

28:42.955 --> 28:45.122
-you're a demon!
-No!

28:48.260 --> 28:50.027
[growling]

28:52.732 --> 28:54.031
[grunts]

29:00.906 --> 29:02.973
[rumbling]

29:04.376 --> 29:06.276
[gasping]

29:09.281 --> 29:10.948
-[Li Jing] Ne Zha!
-[growls]

29:10.950 --> 29:12.516
That'll be enough of that.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.285
-[Li Jing] Boundary Beasts!
-[both] Sir!

29:15.287 --> 29:17.371
[Li Jing] Tighten the boundary.

29:17.372 --> 29:19.456
He's now prohibited from
setting foot outside this room.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.291
-[both] Sir!
-[clinks]

29:29.001 --> 29:31.235
[somber music]

29:32.104 --> 29:33.170
Enough.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.277
We expected
this might happen one day.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.947
We tried but...

29:43.949 --> 29:45.949
maybe this is just his fate.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.421
Even after forbidding them
from mentioning the word demon,

29:51.423 --> 29:53.957
people will never see him
as anything but.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.893
And I've been so busy
fighting monsters

29:55.895 --> 29:57.928
to gain goodwill on his behalf.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.931
[inhales deeply]
I've neglected my boy.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.368
He only has two years left.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.106
[Lady Yin] Let's resign our
positions.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.274
Take him to play
in the mountains,

30:10.276 --> 30:12.276
and just be with him.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.443
Until the end.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.186
[stutters]
Uh, Lady Yin? This is on me.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.488
So I've decided to take him on
as an apprentice.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.774
I'll shape the Demon Pill

30:26.775 --> 30:29.059
into a demon-fighting
warrior of justice.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.862
Is that our only option?

30:31.864 --> 30:33.597
To put him through all that?

30:33.599 --> 30:36.333
Shouldn't we just let him
enjoy the time he's got?

30:37.970 --> 30:40.504
I do not wish to rob him
of a meaningful life.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.006
And would you want this?

30:43.008 --> 30:45.042
For him to be remembered as
a demon?

30:52.218 --> 30:54.117
[Li Xin] Master Ne Zha!

30:54.119 --> 30:55.519
Time for breakfast.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.592
-[clattering]
-[both gasp]

31:01.594 --> 31:02.960
-Huh?
-[Li Xin gasping]

31:02.962 --> 31:04.595
The young Master's
escaped again.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.463
[both] What? Oh, no!

31:06.465 --> 31:07.998
[all panting]

31:11.136 --> 31:12.603
-What?
-[whimpering]

31:12.605 --> 31:14.171
-That's impossible.
-Mm-hm.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.505
-I agree.
-Don't stand there!

31:15.507 --> 31:17.140
Report this to Master Li.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.409
[sighs deeply]

31:19.411 --> 31:21.178
-You can count on me!
-I'm on it.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.048
[scoffs]
There's no guard alive...

31:26.919 --> 31:28.485
who can keep me locked up.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.458
Huh?

31:36.562 --> 31:37.995
[Ne Zha] Wha--

31:39.932 --> 31:41.064
Eh?

31:43.335 --> 31:45.335
[chiming]

31:45.337 --> 31:46.436
[screams]

31:50.276 --> 31:52.109
[screaming continues]

31:52.678 --> 31:54.044

31:57.616 --> 31:59.149
Woah.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.488
[light music]

32:08.594 --> 32:09.660
-Welcome to the world
-[gasps]

32:09.662 --> 32:12.162
inside the painting.
Scenic isn't it?

32:12.164 --> 32:13.297
What's the big id--

32:13.299 --> 32:15.565
Ah-da-da. Hold onto your socks.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.567
I'm about to show you
a little somethin'.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.103
[Taiyi imitates trumpet]

32:20.105 --> 32:22.639
With one stroke,
you can change the painting

32:22.641 --> 32:25.509
to reflect whatever
your little heart desires!

32:26.478 --> 32:28.178
You've got a brush. Big deal!

32:28.180 --> 32:29.479
Why don't you just sit back

32:29.481 --> 32:32.015
and watch this bad boy
in action!

32:32.017 --> 32:33.650
[Taiyi] Do your thing, brush!

32:34.586 --> 32:36.520
[water sloshing]

32:42.995 --> 32:44.628
[Taiyi chuckling]

32:44.630 --> 32:46.063
[Ne Zha] No, no, no.

-[cheers]
-[Ne Zha screaming]

33:27.139 --> 33:29.539
[panting, gasps]

33:29.541 --> 33:31.541
[Taiyi chuckling]

33:35.080 --> 33:37.147
Wow!

33:39.151 --> 33:42.085
Young apprentice,
we haven't even started!

33:45.424 --> 33:46.690
[water splashing]

33:50.462 --> 33:52.529
[light music]

33:57.770 --> 34:00.070
Wow...

34:06.045 --> 34:08.045
[Ne Zha laughing]

34:08.813 --> 34:10.781
Mighty impressive, huh?

34:10.783 --> 34:13.116
Just think,
you can spend every day here

34:13.118 --> 34:15.585
learning the Immortal magic
of Kunlun with me.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.621
Go ahead. Call me master,
I know you're impressed.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.158
Master?
[scoffs]

34:21.159 --> 34:22.592
What could I learn from you?

34:24.129 --> 34:28.165
Huh? Why you--
You're in trouble now.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.833
[Taiyi] On my command,
one, two, change!

34:30.835 --> 34:32.235

34:32.237 --> 34:33.402

34:35.274 --> 34:36.540
-Look out.
-[zaps]

34:38.543 --> 34:40.744
-Magic'd!
-[zaps]

34:40.746 --> 34:42.446
-Huh?
-[Taiyi] That's my handy-dandy

34:42.447 --> 34:43.847
disguising spell.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.849
-Wanna learn it?
-Yeah!

34:45.851 --> 34:47.818
This looks yummy.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.619
-[munches]
-[puffs]

34:49.621 --> 34:52.121
-[coughing]
-[laughing]

34:54.259 --> 34:56.460
So can you make me
look all big and scary?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.395
Now what would I go
and do all that for?

34:58.397 --> 35:01.098
Also, that's next-level stuff,
even I can't pull that off.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.866
Don't get fancy,
learn the basics.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.167
Come on little guy.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.669
Your master's gonna teach you...

35:05.671 --> 35:08.672
[indistinct whispering]

35:08.674 --> 35:11.441
That's easy.
Teach me something cooler.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.577
The disguising spell
is the most basic.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.745
If you won't learn that
then I won't even bother!

35:16.648 --> 35:19.116
Fine. Watch me knock this out.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.352
On my command! Change!

35:23.288 --> 35:24.454
Change!

35:25.324 --> 35:26.756
-Change!
-[chuckles]

35:26.758 --> 35:29.860
The disguising spell
isn't even remotely basic.

35:29.862 --> 35:33.430
Took me six whole months
to master my first disguise.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.733
Knock yourself out,
take your time.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.903
AN IMMORTAL PREPARES

35:43.142 --> 35:45.475

35:54.253 --> 35:56.887
[blabbers]
Lady Yin. What a nice surprise.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.321
I'm checking on Ne Zha.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.323
I'm just teaching him
some stuff.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.391
Where is my son?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.160
Oh, right there...

36:04.196 --> 36:05.529
Huh?

36:06.431 --> 36:08.365
Hang on. What is that?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.169
Ah! Hang on, kid.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.803
I'll save you.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.842
[groans]

36:20.679 --> 36:22.879
[grunting]

36:26.785 --> 36:28.585
Ne Zha. What happened?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.755
What is this?

36:31.756 --> 36:33.890
Huh? I didn't do that!
I promise you!

36:33.892 --> 36:35.525
How'd this happen?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.260
Oh, good, he has a pulse.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.596
[grunting]

36:40.265 --> 36:42.265
[blows air]

36:49.541 --> 36:51.208
[groans]

36:53.612 --> 36:56.346
Oh! Oh, no! It's poisonous.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.747
[blabbering]

37:08.794 --> 37:11.795
You should treat me
with more respect.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.930
How'd you master that spell
so quickly?

37:13.932 --> 37:15.865
I don't know,
by being super awesome?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.701
Okay, don't get jealous.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.704
Even though it took him one day
what took you six months.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.872
[laughing]
Share your trick

37:22.874 --> 37:24.941
with your beloved master?

37:24.942 --> 37:27.009
Teach me more Immortal Magic
and I'll tell you.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.745
Yep! You got it, kid!

37:28.747 --> 37:31.982
Since your element is fire,
I'll teach you fire control.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.717
Tongue of flame. Sands of time.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.552
Unleash heat
from the holy shrine.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.987
Make it so!

37:36.989 --> 37:39.756
[grunting]

37:41.360 --> 37:43.793
[groans]
Not cool, that got in my eye.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.763
I can't say this spell right
with my tongue all swollen.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.033
Aha! Good thing I have
an anti-venom pill in my pants.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.838
Oh, I can't reach it.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.574
Can you get it for me,
little guy, please?

37:57.576 --> 37:59.542
No problem.

37:59.544 --> 38:03.580
Whoa! You've got
like treasure pants!

38:03.582 --> 38:05.849
[Ne Zha] Huh? What's this
weird moppy thingy?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.418
It's for flies.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.054
[Ne Zha] What?
What about this shiny thing?

38:11.056 --> 38:12.789
That's a fire-tipped spear.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.325
[Ne Zha] A fire-tipped spear,
huh?

38:15.327 --> 38:17.027
Hey, don't touch that switch.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.762
-You mean this switch?
-[clicking]

38:18.764 --> 38:20.730
[flames roar]

38:22.734 --> 38:24.534
Huh? Ha?

38:27.472 --> 38:29.839
[screaming]

38:32.678 --> 38:35.078
Ne Zha!
Are you causing trouble again?

38:38.417 --> 38:41.051
[panting]

38:41.053 --> 38:43.420
-Your grace! Are you all right?
-[Taiyi sighs deeply]

38:43.422 --> 38:46.556
I'm an immortal,
I can't get hurt, but thanks.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.759
Ne Zha. If you show me respect,

38:49.761 --> 38:51.061
the things I'll teach you...

38:51.063 --> 38:53.663
Like banishing demons
and defeating monsters.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.966
What? Banish demons?
And defeat monsters?

38:56.968 --> 39:00.070
Nice try! Like I'd ever
learn anything from you.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.638
How do I get out of here?

39:01.640 --> 39:03.973
Well you'll have to use
this little landscape brush,

39:03.975 --> 39:06.109
if you wish to escape
from the painting.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.711
Oh, wait a minute.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.813
You want to keep me
locked up in here.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.798
No don't be silly.

39:11.799 --> 39:13.782
A place this lovely
could never be a prison, dear.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.585
It's a "training retreat."

39:15.587 --> 39:18.021
So I train
and they'd still hate me anyway.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.523
I'd be better off
just taking a nap.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.528
[Lady Yin] Ne Zha.
I'm your mother.

39:25.530 --> 39:29.432
I know you. I know you want
the others to accept you.

39:29.434 --> 39:32.969
But you feel more and more alone
every time they rejected you.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.938
And you resent them for that.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.005
[scoffs]

39:37.576 --> 39:39.109
Young master?

39:39.111 --> 39:43.546
How did he get out again?
Young master?

39:44.082 --> 39:46.149
[giggling]
Huh?

39:50.021 --> 39:52.155
Hi, you wanna play?

39:54.126 --> 39:55.425
Mm-hm!

39:55.427 --> 39:56.726
[both giggle]

39:56.728 --> 39:58.995
[shrieks]
Ne Zha!

39:58.997 --> 40:00.563
I thought he was locked away!

40:00.565 --> 40:03.700
-They let him out!
-Everyone run!

40:03.702 --> 40:06.002
[crowd clamoring]

40:08.607 --> 40:10.540
[whimpers]

40:13.145 --> 40:15.044
Go back to where you came from!

40:15.046 --> 40:16.746
-Yeah!
-Little demon brat!

40:16.748 --> 40:18.748
-No one likes you!
-You're a Demon!

40:18.750 --> 40:20.016
Yeah, no one wants you here!

40:20.018 --> 40:21.484
Go away!

40:26.057 --> 40:28.992
You've been through a lot,
but it will be alright.

40:28.994 --> 40:32.028
After your training you'll
be able to banish demons

40:32.030 --> 40:34.864
with us and earn
their admiration.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.467
Why would I do anything
for them? Never!

40:37.469 --> 40:38.968
They wanna see me as a demon?

40:38.970 --> 40:40.970
I'll show them what a demon
really looks like!

40:42.007 --> 40:43.072
Dear, you...

40:43.074 --> 40:44.741
[sighs]

40:45.911 --> 40:49.546
I guess it's time
we tell you the truth.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.015
The secret we've kept
for so long.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.218
Why they're so afraid.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.455
-[gasps]
-You are actually...

40:58.457 --> 41:00.557
The Spirit, what?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.092
[inhales deeply]
Oh. right, right. right!

41:03.094 --> 41:04.928
The reincarnation!

41:04.930 --> 41:07.797
And it's that divine strength
they find so intimidating.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.834
Are you... lying?

41:10.836 --> 41:13.603
[scoffs]
Use your head.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.205
Your father and I are humans.

41:15.207 --> 41:17.207
How could we give birth
to a demon?

41:17.209 --> 41:20.143
Then, why don't you just
tell them I'm the Spirit Pearl?

41:20.145 --> 41:22.245
The Spirit Pearl
was a secret weapon

41:22.247 --> 41:24.981
the Supreme Lord sent down
to the mortal realm.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.984
It's not called an "everyone
knows about it" weapon.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.053
[Taiyi] They couldn't
handle the truth.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.022
The truth...

41:33.024 --> 41:35.258
In the meantime,
try to win their hearts.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.893
Treat them as if they're family.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.194
Keep them safe from harm,

41:38.196 --> 41:40.029
and they'll surely
return the favor,

41:40.031 --> 41:42.265
embracing you
as one of their own.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.874
TWO YEARS LATER

41:52.177 --> 41:53.710

41:59.184 --> 42:00.250

42:09.794 --> 42:11.528
Total piece of cake.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.296
[whistling]

42:16.735 --> 42:19.969
[Taiyi] No, no, no.
Way too impulsive.

42:25.277 --> 42:26.676
Show him, go on.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.999
Stop there.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.635
Yummy human!

[skeleton screams]

42:55.707 --> 42:56.839

43:02.581 --> 43:03.680
[Taiyi] <i> And here too.</i>

43:07.586 --> 43:09.252
-[explosion]
-[people screaming]

43:09.254 --> 43:11.654
Look at that. You harmed
all those innocent civilians,

43:11.656 --> 43:13.323
just to destroy
a couple skeletons.

43:13.325 --> 43:15.058
Yeah, they're
not even real though.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.726
What's the big deal.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.895
If you can't do the right thing
in training,

43:18.897 --> 43:21.064
how can we trust you
in the real world.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.167
Your Grace, take away
his Chaotic Silk and spear.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.035
[Li Jing]
Until he learns self-control,

43:26.037 --> 43:27.737
he's banned from
such powerful weapons.

43:27.739 --> 43:30.940
Fine, so take it back.
See if I care!

43:30.942 --> 43:32.275
I've learned
all your Immortal Magic,

43:32.277 --> 43:33.943
so I can go kick demon butt.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.011
No way.

43:35.013 --> 43:37.180
In fact, from now on
your only focus

43:37.182 --> 43:39.082
will be meditation not fighting.

43:39.084 --> 43:41.918
What? You wanted me to learn
how to fight monsters.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.152
Well I did that!

43:43.154 --> 43:45.188
Oh, why won't you
let me out of here?

43:45.190 --> 43:47.290
You're not leaving here
'til I say so.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.394
[scoffs]
Yeah, whatever.

43:51.396 --> 43:53.296
I'd like to see you
try and stop me.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.198
-Huh, how'd he get that?
-Ne Zha!

43:56.201 --> 43:57.800
[Ne Zha]
Don't worry, I got this!

43:57.802 --> 43:59.268
They're gonna love me!

to change things up.

You can't escape.

Demon, let the girl go.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.375
Why should I listen to you?

47:26.377 --> 47:29.512
Stay back, child.
I'm here to save her.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.147
I'm not a child!

47:31.149 --> 47:32.615

are you doing?

47:59.010 --> 48:01.110
Wait your turn!
I'll kick your butt next!

48:01.112 --> 48:03.312
Where are you paren--
[grunts]

48:04.582 --> 48:06.282
[groans]

48:07.619 --> 48:09.952
Town's only big enough
for one cool guy.

48:11.022 --> 48:13.089
-Hey, demon! Let that girl go!
-Huh?

48:16.094 --> 48:18.094
There's something
different about you.

48:18.096 --> 48:19.295
Whatever!

48:21.933 --> 48:23.566
-[thuds]
-[rumbles]

48:31.009 --> 48:32.275
-[munches]
-[gasps]

48:32.277 --> 48:35.544
Ow, let go! I said let go!

48:35.546 --> 48:37.480
[cloak rasps]

48:38.283 --> 48:40.416
[laughing]

48:40.418 --> 48:42.385
Huh? Woah, you have horns!

48:42.387 --> 48:44.153
Huh.
[sighs]

48:45.223 --> 48:47.356
[grunting]

48:52.563 --> 48:54.330
[laughing]

48:56.234 --> 48:58.034
[blows air]

49:01.039 --> 49:03.272
[suspenseful music]

49:04.475 --> 49:06.042
[groans]

49:12.417 --> 49:14.150
Huh, bubbles?

49:16.554 --> 49:18.220
[gasps]
What's goin' on?

49:18.222 --> 49:21.390
[laughing]
Take a good look around you.

49:21.392 --> 49:24.060
I should thank you both
for giving me time

49:24.062 --> 49:26.195
to unleash my special attack.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.030
[Sea Yaksha] Go on, make a move.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.532
Not so tough now, huh?

49:29.534 --> 49:31.467
I can finally have my dinner
in peace.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.669
-[Yaya yelps]
-[gulping]

49:33.671 --> 49:36.505
-[laughs]
-Hey, spit her out!

49:36.507 --> 49:38.708
When I get done with you,
you'll wish that you--

49:39.644 --> 49:42.345
[whooshing]

49:44.282 --> 49:45.748
[grunts]

49:48.286 --> 49:49.418
[Sea Yaksha retches, chuckles]

49:49.420 --> 49:51.120
You don't look so good.

49:51.122 --> 49:53.222
Uh-oh, my spit gotcha!

49:53.224 --> 49:56.092
Seems like you hit
"rock bottom".

49:58.529 --> 50:00.262
Maybe in your next life

50:00.264 --> 50:03.666
you'll learn
to mind your own business.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.334
[screams]

50:06.571 --> 50:08.471
-[grunting]
-[bubbles popping]

50:08.473 --> 50:10.139
Huh?
[grunts]

50:11.309 --> 50:12.641
[gasps]

50:14.779 --> 50:16.379
[blowing air]

50:19.784 --> 50:21.517
[blowing continues]

50:24.288 --> 50:26.555
[laughing]
Bring it on, kid!

50:31.796 --> 50:34.196
[whooshing]

50:37.602 --> 50:39.468
-[whooshing continues]
-[Ne Zha laughs]

50:39.470 --> 50:40.569
[inhales deeply]

50:45.276 --> 50:46.709
-[thuds]
-[screams]

50:48.046 --> 50:50.046
[groaning]

50:53.418 --> 50:54.817
Please have mercy!

50:54.819 --> 50:56.819
I'll give you the antidote!

50:56.821 --> 50:58.087
Antidote?

50:59.323 --> 51:01.590
[snorting]

51:03.694 --> 51:06.162
Don't worry. It's enough.

51:06.164 --> 51:07.663
[bubble pops]

51:08.533 --> 51:10.599
[groans]

51:15.773 --> 51:17.740
[retches]
It tastes like garlic!

51:19.444 --> 51:22.211
Huh? Look at that!
[chuckles]

51:22.213 --> 51:24.580
How'll they drink?
Their mouths can't move!

51:24.582 --> 51:27.750
Uh, you can also apply it
to the skin.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.618
-[chuckles]
-[gasps]

51:30.788 --> 51:33.155
Why didn't you say so?

51:33.157 --> 51:36.225
Well, because you didn't ask.
[chuckles]

51:38.596 --> 51:41.597
[Sea Yaksha] That's right,
spread it evenly.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.300
You have to
really massage it in.

51:44.302 --> 51:46.335
The skin'll absorb it faster.

51:46.337 --> 51:49.171
Plus, it makes the complexion
all dewy!

51:51.209 --> 51:53.275
[light music]

52:02.820 --> 52:04.620
[footsteps rustling]

52:10.695 --> 52:12.695
[sniffs, groans]

52:12.697 --> 52:14.163
-[Ao Bing] Wait.
-Huh?

52:14.165 --> 52:15.564
[grunts]
Spare me.

52:15.566 --> 52:17.766
I just wanted a snack.

52:17.768 --> 52:19.468
I didn't eat a person.

52:19.470 --> 52:22.238
You gave us the antidote.
So I'm grateful.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.640
But if you try to do evil
in the future,

52:24.642 --> 52:26.142
I won't spare you again.

52:26.144 --> 52:28.277
[chuckles]
Okay, okay.

52:30.281 --> 52:31.614
Hey, you! Boy!

52:31.616 --> 52:33.149
What? Still wanna fight?

52:33.151 --> 52:34.216
That's not fair to you.

52:34.218 --> 52:36.619
Huh? I'm no match for you?

52:36.621 --> 52:38.521
Come on then.
Show me what you got.

52:38.523 --> 52:40.422
-Thank you for saving me.
-Huh?

52:40.424 --> 52:42.658
[Ao Bing] And for saving
this girl as well.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.527
Today you were my ally.

52:44.529 --> 52:47.163
I will find a way to repay
the kindness you've shown.

52:47.165 --> 52:49.165
[chuckles]
Nah, it was nothin'.

52:49.167 --> 52:51.700
I was simply following
the will of Heaven.

52:51.702 --> 52:55.237
Cause I was destined
to be a great demon slayer!

52:55.640 --> 52:57.740
[giggling]

52:58.776 --> 53:01.544
You're not afraid of me?

53:01.546 --> 53:04.480
You save Yaya from bad guy.

53:06.217 --> 53:08.551
[both laugh]

53:08.553 --> 53:10.753
[giggling]

53:16.460 --> 53:18.761
[Yaya gasps, laughs]

53:22.633 --> 53:24.867
[whooshing]

53:28.306 --> 53:30.372
[calm music]

53:31.642 --> 53:33.642
Hm. Huh?

53:48.926 --> 53:51.360
[whooshing]

54:04.675 --> 54:06.909
[calm music]

54:18.522 --> 54:20.489
Hey. What's wrong?

54:20.491 --> 54:23.659
It's nothing.
Just got eyes in my sand.

54:23.661 --> 54:25.628
[Ao Bing] You mean sand
in your eyes?

54:25.630 --> 54:28.264
Let me see.
I can get it out for you.

54:31.302 --> 54:34.536
Aw man! This is so embarrassing!

54:35.740 --> 54:37.507
Okay, fine!

54:37.508 --> 54:39.275
My mom's the only other person
who'll play this with me.

54:39.277 --> 54:41.410
So I got emotional. Big deal!

54:42.013 --> 54:43.412
[grunts]

54:46.817 --> 54:47.916
Huh?

54:47.918 --> 54:50.119
We're friends now.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.321
If you want to play again,
come to the shore and blow this.

54:52.323 --> 54:55.457
When I hear the conch shell,
I'll come from wherever I am.

54:55.459 --> 54:57.026
I forgot. I'm Ao Bing.

54:57.028 --> 54:58.494
And you?

54:58.496 --> 55:00.362
My name's Ne Zha!

55:01.866 --> 55:03.365
Your friends?

55:03.367 --> 55:04.700
-What?
-[crowd murmuring]

55:04.702 --> 55:06.402
[clamoring]

55:06.404 --> 55:07.870
-There she is!
-He's here!

55:09.774 --> 55:10.873
Huh?

55:14.812 --> 55:16.545
[crowd panting]

55:16.547 --> 55:18.414
There's Ne Zha.
He kidnapped Yaya!

55:18.416 --> 55:19.682
The demon!

55:19.684 --> 55:21.617
My baby! Oh, Yaya!

55:21.619 --> 55:22.918
Yaya! How are you feeling?

55:22.920 --> 55:25.387
Ne Zha hit. Pow, pow, pow!

55:25.389 --> 55:27.523
Demon go, boom, boom!

55:27.525 --> 55:29.458
Why would you kidnap
a little girl!?

55:29.460 --> 55:30.626
That's not what happened!

55:30.628 --> 55:32.094
If I hadn't
chased that thing down,

55:32.096 --> 55:33.862
she would've been
demon-food already.

55:33.864 --> 55:36.065
So where's the demon then?
Did you see one?

55:36.067 --> 55:37.433
How about you?

55:37.434 --> 55:38.800
Do you seriously think
we're that dumb?

55:38.803 --> 55:39.968
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

55:39.970 --> 55:41.770
You won't get away with this!

55:44.875 --> 55:47.976
-[crowd clamoring]
-Okay, I see.

55:50.348 --> 55:52.848
Go away, you demon brat!

55:56.520 --> 55:57.920
[whooshes]

55:58.789 --> 56:00.522
You wanna say that again?

56:00.958 --> 56:02.591
[gasps]
Stop it!

56:03.427 --> 56:04.727
-[grunts]
-[thumps]

56:09.467 --> 56:12.134
-[all gasp]
-See? He's a monster!

56:12.136 --> 56:14.536
-We'll kill you!
-Die, demon!

56:17.141 --> 56:19.541
-[thumping, thudding]
-[crowd screaming]

56:21.579 --> 56:22.811
[all gasp]

56:27.485 --> 56:28.851
[grunts]

56:33.991 --> 56:35.524
[thuds, groans]

56:39.830 --> 56:41.563
[Ne Zha screams]

56:43.100 --> 56:45.067
Your master has arrived.

56:45.069 --> 56:46.635
Stop hurting people.

56:46.637 --> 56:47.703
[whooshing]

56:49.039 --> 56:50.873
[yelps, screams]

56:50.875 --> 56:52.474
-[Lady Yin] Ne Zha.
-[growls]

56:54.445 --> 56:55.944
[Old Man] Commander Li!

56:55.946 --> 56:58.881
Ne Zha burned down the village,
kidnapped a child,

56:58.883 --> 57:00.649
and attacked the villagers.

57:00.651 --> 57:02.951
-We demand he be punished.
-[crowd chatter]

57:02.953 --> 57:06.455
My crimes? I'm gonna show you
a real crime!

57:06.457 --> 57:07.589
-[Ne Zha grunts]
-[Lady Yin] Ne Zha, don't.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.959
[whooshes]

57:10.961 --> 57:12.961
[Ne Zha grunting]

57:17.001 --> 57:21.003
Lord Li, you must lock
this demon-child up.

57:21.005 --> 57:23.205
Never again to see
the light of day.

57:23.207 --> 57:25.574
Lock him up!
And throw away the key!

57:25.576 --> 57:27.142
-[crowd cheer]
-Lord Li,

57:27.144 --> 57:29.077
you must get your son
under control!

57:29.079 --> 57:31.013
We'd thank you!

57:31.015 --> 57:34.750
[crowd clamoring]

57:34.752 --> 57:36.084
[villager]
He's destroying everything!

57:36.086 --> 57:37.786
It's not safe!

57:41.125 --> 57:43.192
[crowd jeering]

57:47.932 --> 57:50.132
Father... Master.

57:50.134 --> 57:53.735
How did today's assignment go?

57:53.737 --> 57:56.872
I made seven lesser revolutions
and four greater ones.

57:56.874 --> 57:59.741
I learned to ice over rivers
and create frost and snow.

57:59.743 --> 58:02.110
I've reached the seventh heaven
of the Ice Jade.

58:03.013 --> 58:05.747
Also... I made a friend.

58:05.749 --> 58:07.483
I met him near the seashore.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.785
Wha-- what do you mean a friend?

58:09.787 --> 58:12.187
[stutters]
You can't reveal your identity.

58:12.189 --> 58:14.790
He was a human,
but he didn't care what I was.

58:14.792 --> 58:17.159
-Because I'm his friend.
-And who was this person?

58:17.161 --> 58:19.695
His name was... Ne Zha.

58:19.697 --> 58:22.698
-Huh?
-[growls]

58:22.700 --> 58:27.002
[chuckles]
Sma-- small world, apprentice.

58:27.004 --> 58:29.671
Sounds like you just met
the Demon Pill.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.640
-Oh, no.
-Ne Zha...

58:31.642 --> 58:34.076
-is your sworn rival.
-[gasps]

58:34.078 --> 58:36.545
[Shen] We've waited
three whole years.

58:36.547 --> 58:38.180
On the day the reckoning occurs,

58:38.182 --> 58:41.283
the Demon Pill will begin
a mama-- massacre...

58:41.285 --> 58:43.952
and then you will rescue
Chentang Pass

58:43.954 --> 58:48.223
and claim your birthright
as the Spirit Pearl.

58:48.225 --> 58:51.260
Master, might he be granted
redemption?

58:51.262 --> 58:52.794
[panting]

58:52.796 --> 58:55.197
In the times of antiquity,

58:55.199 --> 58:58.300
we dragons
were all-powerful beings,

58:58.302 --> 59:00.869
revered and worshipped.

59:00.871 --> 59:04.172
On behalf of Heaven,
we fought monsters,

59:04.174 --> 59:06.208
subduing them in the ocean,

59:06.210 --> 59:09.778
earning us
the title of Dragon Kings.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.680
Do you understand

59:11.682 --> 59:13.849
what this place really is?

59:13.851 --> 59:15.117
Our Palace, right?

59:15.119 --> 59:18.053
Beneath the magma
of this volcano

59:18.055 --> 59:22.291
are the countless creatures
we defeated those many years ago

59:22.293 --> 59:25.727
at the request
of the Supreme Lord.

59:27.965 --> 59:30.232
[Dragon King] "Dragon Palace"?

59:30.234 --> 59:31.967
[laughs]

59:31.969 --> 59:35.637
It's as much our prison
as it is theirs.

59:36.040 --> 59:37.706
[hisses]

59:37.708 --> 59:40.108
If we were to leave this place,

59:40.110 --> 59:44.046
the monsters would break free of
their imprisonment and escape.

59:44.048 --> 59:46.214
Do you see now, son?

59:46.216 --> 59:50.852
They tricked us into
doing their dirty work for them.

59:51.755 --> 59:53.221
After all.

59:53.223 --> 59:54.990
What were we to Heaven

59:54.992 --> 59:59.728
other than just monsters
to be locked away.

59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.764
The title "King" they gave us?

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:06.034
It's laughable.
I am nothing more than

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:08.971
another prisoner in this pit.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:13.609
We sealed our fate the moment
we took them at their word.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:17.179
So, my boy,
for the past millennium,

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:21.717
the Spirit Pearl has been
our only hope for freedom.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:23.318
In one year's time,

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.888
I'll be able to completely
remove the horns on your head

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.958
and hide your identity
as a dada-- dragon.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.928
If you're victorious
on the day of reckoning.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.732
Then and only then will you
win a place in Heaven,

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.934
and be able
to break the dragons free

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:42.137
of this underwater purgatory.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:46.808
Our fate rests entirely
on your shoulders.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.177
Don't let yourself be fooled

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:52.014
by the illusion of friendship.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.122
[Ne Zha singing]
<i> ¶ I'm a scary demon ¶</i>

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.858
<i> ¶ Better run and hide ¶</i>

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.260
<i>¶ Legend says I'll eat and eat ¶</i>

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.963
<i> ¶ 'Til everyone has died ¶</i>

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.866
<i> ¶ And they're right</i>
<i> You should steer clear ¶</i>

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:13.168
<i> ¶ Best take their suggestion ¶</i>

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.303
<i> ¶ Cause when I eat too much ¶</i>

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:18.173
<i> ¶ I get real bad indigestion ¶</i>

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.709
[sighs deeply]

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:26.748
Please eat. You haven't had
anything in three days.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.717
-[grunts]
-[clatters]

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:32.821
[Li Xin panting]

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.089
[sighs deeply]

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.760
Dear. How long are you going
to be like this?

01:01:38.762 --> 01:01:40.262
Leave me alone.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:43.098
I just wanna die in peace.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.067
<i>¶ I try to help but no one cares</i>
<i> so honestly why bother? ¶</i>

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:46.802
Isn't jianzi your favorite, huh?

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:48.136
I could play with you right now.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.871
<i> ¶ I'm tired</i>
<i> Of being a burden to ¶</i>

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.139
I've designed a really neat
new training course

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.406
-in your painting...
-<i> ¶ My mother and my father ¶</i>

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.192
...called Ride the Clouds.

01:01:54.193 --> 01:01:55.976
<i>-¶ I kinda wish I wasn't here ¶</i>
-Wanna give it a try?

01:01:55.979 --> 01:01:58.880

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.283
[snoring]

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.959
Hey! Your third birthday's
only ten days away.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:13.929
The people of Chentang Pass
want to celebrate with you.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:14.996
Yeah?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.899
[sighs]

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.403
They'd celebrate my funeral.
Not my birthday.

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.438
[scoffs]

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:27.109
The Sea Yaksha
can move as water,

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:28.477
without being noticed.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:32.347
It's saliva can petrify people
and leaves a residue.

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:35.317
That misunderstanding
has been resolved.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.452
They know you drove off
the demon.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:39.154
Oh! Yes, your father's right.

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:42.124
The celebration's the thank you
for defeating that monster.

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:44.092
It would be.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.861
I see my teachings
have paid off!

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:48.063
[scoffs]
Now those morons get it.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.433
About time.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.100
-Promise you'll be there?
-All right, fine!

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:04.079
[giggling, cheering]

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.548
[cloth rustles]

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:11.219
[slurps, giggles]

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:17.292
Why did you lie
about his birthday?

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:21.096
Believing he's the Spirit Pearl

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:23.231
has given him joy.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.033
If it means
he can stay that way,

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.568
then yes, I'm going to lie.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.170
Well, except...

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:31.106
the villagers were clear
they want to lock him up.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:32.574
Why would they attend his party?

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:37.012
[Li Jing] Let me
handle the details.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.513
On the beach that day,

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:40.949
I saw the Yaksha slime
on his hands.

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.984
He was telling the truth.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.020
And I will see to it
that they all learn that,

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:46.354
at the celebration.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:47.923
But...

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:50.926
When you've been commander
as long as I have,

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.028
many people owe you favors.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.464
I'll get them all to attend.
You can count on that.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:57.599
Don't worry.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.447
-[blows air]
-[conch plays]

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.223
-[inhales deeply]
-[Ao Bing] What do you want?

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:23.158
[shrieks]

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.993
Ah, don't scare me like that.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:27.996
My birthday party's in ten days.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.098
And everyone in the Pass
is gonna be there.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.436
I, uh, drew you a map
so you wouldn't get lost.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.039
Li Manor's renowned.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.308
I guess.
But you're coming, aren't ya?

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.377
-Well...
-Oh, come on!

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.113
I don't care if they don't come
but you gotta be there!

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:46.615
Why's that?

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:48.516
Maybe 'cause
you're my only friend.

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:54.122
You're my only friend, too.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.492
Do you have any other wishes?

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.478
You saved my life.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.463
So I'll do everything I can
to make them come true.

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.566
Wishes? Eh, like I said!

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:06.468
My wish is you'd come
to my party!

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.604
I'll go.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:11.406
It's a deal! See you there!

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:19.147
Don't bail!

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:20.282
I won't.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.219
[giggling]

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:36.598
[Shen] Ao Bing,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.935
-[gasps]
-It's time to go.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.636
One more thing.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:46.608
[grunting]

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:50.145
Father!

[Dragon King exhales deeply]

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.154
Wait, what're you--

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:04.125
[grunting]

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.365
[scales shattering]

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:16.204
[chiming]

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.615
My son...

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.251
Each of the dragons
has given you

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:33.621
their hardest scale
for protection.

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:37.258
[Dragon King] Dragonscale armor
is impenetrable.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.261
It's all up to you now.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.702
[light music playing]

01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.280
[light music continues playing]

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.150
Huh? Why're you so sad?

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:05.220
Show enthusiasm. Smile.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.591
[groans]

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.326
Why does it sound
like a funeral?

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:13.728
[upbeat music playing]

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:19.768
When does Lord Li
want us to come out?

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:21.169
He'll signal.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.637
Oh.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.745
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm feelin' this cape.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:34.082
Fancy!
[chuckling]

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.718
[Shen] A good shroud
for a corpse maybe.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.386
What?

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.622
I am your ma-mast--

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.791
-[shatters]
-Ew, gross, a demon!

01:07:42.793 --> 01:07:44.059
-[grunting]
-[Shen] Stop!

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:45.660
I know your master!

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:48.329
So I'm a friend to you!

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:51.399
Oh. Your name is
Shen something, right?

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:53.501
Shen Go-go-go--

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:54.769
What up, Shen Gonggong?

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.506
Brat. It's Shen Go-go-gong-bao!

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:02.210
And I'm here to reveal
your true identity.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:05.413
-What do you mean "true"?
-[chuckles]

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.715
Oh, my poor child.

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:11.553
You have been kept in the dark
for far too long.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:19.493
And now let's bring out
the birthday boy!

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:21.462
[lighting crackles]

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:27.234
[crowd murmuring]

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:32.107
[giggling]
Play with me!

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.608
-Huh?
-[whimpers]

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.249
Today is your birthday,
young apprentice.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:44.486
And let me tell you
I'm gonna spoil you rotten!

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.154
[Taiyi grunts]

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.359
[upbeat music]

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:56.663
[spear whooshing]

01:08:56.666 --> 01:09:00.201
[Taiyi] Your fire-tipped spear
and Chaotic Silk.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.604
They're officially yours now.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.772
And here's the big one!
[whistles]

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:10.411
[Taiyi] This shall serve
as your noble steed.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.247
Go on, touch it.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.582
[snorts]

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.227
This guy's
my most prized possession.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.895
It can transform
into various mounts

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.697
based on the traits
of its owners.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.667
With you, it will take the form
of a flaming chariot!

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.569
[laughing]

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:37.337
So why does it turn into a pig
with you then?

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.573
Huh?

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.774
[crowd gasping]

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.711
-[shrieks]
-[crowd murmur]

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.185
You stinker.
Where has the time gone?

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:51.319
Just three years ago,

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:53.488
you were a little meatball
in my belly.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:56.658
And now you've become a man
with a personality and...

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.860
[sobs]

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.795
I so want to watch you grow up.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:08.736
[sighs]
Why are you talking like that

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.538
on his birthday?

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.508
Dad got you a protection charm
to keep you safe.

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:16.778
I know I've always been
hard on you,

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.613
and you're angry about that.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:21.616
But I was doing
what I thought best.

01:10:21.618 --> 01:10:24.452
Now son, you have
a long life ahead.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:26.854
Do not pay any attention
to what the others say.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:28.823
You are who you say you are.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.259
That's all that matters.

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:34.429
[scoffs]
I believed you.

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.497
But all you've done
was lie to me.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.566
[gasps]
Why are you saying that?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.569
Come on. The Demon Pill?

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.471
I know about everything.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.474
You said I was the Spirit Pearl.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:48.476
Put me through training
in the painting.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:49.978
But really you were just

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:51.980
keeping me locked up
until I died.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.948
All to make these idiots happy!

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.318
To keep your dumb reputation,
you locked me away!

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.655
Now you're being silly.

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.290
Don't be so dramatic.

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.858
I mean,
look at all these people!

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.427
Eating, drinking, being merry.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.829
[laughing]

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.697
Why am I not surprised?

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:12.767
Fine. If you wanna
keep lying too.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.370
With the power of sun and moon

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:17.505
-of sea and sand...
-Where did you learn that spell?

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.775
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.313

Run away!

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.974
[crowd clamoring]

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.309
Finally...

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:57.312
It's just you and me demon!

[grunting]

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:20.501
[grunting continues]

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.378
[rumbling]

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:35.450
-[growling]
-Ne Zha! Stop this!

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:36.684
He's been possessed!

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.087
The Qiankun Hoop
is our only hope!

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:40.555
[Lady Yin] Find the hoop!

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.992
[Shen chuckles]
Looking for this?

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:48.830
[stutters]
Don't waste your time.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:53.101
Only the heavenly calamity
can stop the Demon Pill.

01:12:53.103 --> 01:12:55.903
Once he's killed Taiyi
and his parents,

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.872
go subdue Ne Zha.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.074
Until the lightning
destroys him.

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.809
And when the dust clears,

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:04.112
the villagers will see you
as a hero.

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:08.149
After all that, the Supreme Lord
will turn you into a god.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.685
Your power will be limitless.

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.489
Ne Zha's parents and Taiyi.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.557
They are all innocent.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.760
It's not right.
If the hoop was still on,

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.061
then Ne Zha wouldn't be evil.

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.630
What do you care
if he's good or evil?

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:25.533
He's about to get struck
by lightning!

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:28.736
[gasps]
If Taiyi and his parents survive

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.806
how will I sell our lie
to the Supreme Lord?

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:40.581
Fortune didn't smile upon me
when I was born.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.484
I had to fight an uphill battle
to get this far.

01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:46.654
Of all the disciples, I trained
the hardest,

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:48.089
never slacking.

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:51.692
Yet continually I was passed
over for the others.

01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:54.796
Do-- Do you know why, my child?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.964
No, master.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:14:00.635
Because he knows I was born
a lowly jaguar spirit.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:04.739
So he could care less
if I lived or died!

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:08.876
To everyone else,
you and I are just monsters.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:11.579
They could construct
an entire mountain

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.132
with their prejudice.

01:14:14.133 --> 01:14:16.684
And no matter how hard you try,
that mountain is immovable.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.786
But you're being handed
a rare chance

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.688
to change their minds.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:23.124
To alter your fate.

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:25.960
-Master. I owe Ne Zha my life.
-Huh?

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.528
Maybe I can't save him

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:30.064
but let me save his parents
and his master,

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:31.833
to repay my debt.

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.868
[growls]
Go.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.570
-[clinks]
-Huh?

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:38.473
-Go on, then.
-[gasps]

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:42.543
But if, if,
if this goes south...

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.979
[stuttering]
don't say I didn't warn you boy.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:49.917
If they discover what you are...
[laughing]

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:54.121
Then I promise more than four
will meet their fate today...

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:57.124
Uh... Hey. I was talking!

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:59.627

-[whooshing]

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.241

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.734

Hear that?
We're missing the whole party.

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:28.916
Are you sure we can't go out?

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.952
Lord Li said there's a signal.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:32.687
Oh. Oh, oh.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.025

[gasps]

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:58.245
[Ao Bing] Use the Hoop!

01:16:58.247 --> 01:16:59.614
Sun and moon, of sea and sand,

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:01.248
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.858
[gasps, grunting]

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.129
Hold!

-[clinks]
-[panting]

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.241
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:33.014
Dear? It's your mother.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.785

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:45.326
[Lady Yin] Wait!

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:57.772
Please, wait.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.774
Thank you for your assistance
today.

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.108
Tell me, what is your name?

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:03.144
My name isn't worth knowing,
Milord.

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:06.047
Nonsense, I must make a toast,
to thank you.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:09.050
I have an urgent task
I must attend to.

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:11.786
[gasps]
I'm sorry. Let me get that.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.087
-No need.

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.611
A dragon!

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:21.995
Weren't they imprisoned
in the Eastern Sea

01:18:21.998 --> 01:18:24.398
by the Court of Heaven?
How did he get out?

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.468
I knew I detected
a familiar scent on you.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.970
But that mark on your head
confirms my suspicions.

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:31.939
-[gasps]
-That sigil!

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.141
So the dragons stole
the Spirit Pearl.

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:37.912
I could chase you if I wanted!

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:40.247
What else would you expect from
a bunch of dragons?

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:42.817
[Taiyi] No wonder
your kind were locked away.

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:44.018
[crowd murmur]

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.486
Well, you can't cross
the dragons.

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.988
So, the dragons
were the thieves. Figures.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:50.124
The Court of Heaven
shouldn't have left them alive.

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:54.929
[Shen] Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.864
How unfortunate.

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:59.484
Brother?

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:02.103
For this to work
only four people needed to die.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.370
But wouldn't you know?

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.473
Now everyone sees what you are.

01:19:05.475 --> 01:19:08.442
Now no one
gets to su-sur-- survive.

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.077
Please tell me
you weren't involved.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.948
I'm afraid I can't.
It would be quite rude to lie.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:16.817
As for the Pearl, I stole it.

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:19.920
And Ao Bing is my apprentice.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.189
Uh, have you lost your mind?

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:23.524
I'm gonna tell the Supreme Lord!

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:25.893
[laughing]

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.895
Good thing
I'm one step ahead then.

01:19:27.897 --> 01:19:32.133
If you all die, there will be no
one left to tell him will there?

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.534
Apprentice,

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:37.538
there's only one thing
to be done.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.207
The survival of your people

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:43.077
depends on the next decision.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.216
[Dragon King]
<i> For the past millennium,</i>

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:54.288

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:57.258
<i> It's all up to you now.</i>

-What is he doing?

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:52.580
He's trying
to bury Chentang Pass!

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:51.105
[Taiyi] A great deal of time
has already passed.

01:21:51.107 --> 01:21:53.307
We should head back
as soon as possible.

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:55.476
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.612
[blabbering]

01:21:58.614 --> 01:22:00.547
You can't leave,
you just got here!

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:02.950
I, I'll die of loneliness!

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.184
You're being clingy!

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:07.454
[sighs]
You can't break this curse

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:09.256
but there are ways around it.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.092
Like a transplant spell.
You thought about that?

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.228
Yeah, but what does he know?

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:16.363
Are you gonna trust me
or an annoying cloud?

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:19.233
I've studied with the Master
for centuries before you.

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:20.501
I know things you don't!

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:22.469
Let me show you
what talent looks like.

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.171
Yeah, okay, airhead.

These guys are
Fate-Swapping Runes.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.610
Find a relative willing to
sacrifice their life.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:31.512
Have them put one rune
on themselves,

01:22:31.514 --> 01:22:33.514
and the other
on the cursed individual.

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:37.151
And then instead of him,
the relative will go boom!

Woah, hey! What are you doing?

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:56.070
I've decided to swap my life
for that of my son's.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:57.471
This stays between you and me.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.573
I beg of you,
don't tell my wife.

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:02.042
[sighs]
Milord...

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:04.645
Ultimately, your sacrifice
would just go to waste.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.714
The Demon Pill
will bring disaster

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:08.749
and the Supreme Lord
will never let him go.

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.584
[Chang] The Demon Pill?

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:13.153
I will use the remaining
two years I have left

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:14.388
to make him a warrior.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.123
The people shall see him
as a hero.

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:17.257
No, I can't allow it!

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:18.976
If you won't allow it,

01:23:18.977 --> 01:23:20.694
when the lightning strikes
during the Heavenly Calamity,

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:22.029
I will die with Ne Zha.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:24.231
That's, that's so not fair!

01:23:24.233 --> 01:23:26.166
Uh, who is Ne Zha?

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:28.702
He is my son.

Don't waste your breath.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:03.497
Shen Gonggong?
What are you doing here?

01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:06.166
It's Shen Gong-Bao!

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:08.769
Shen Gongbao was the one
who stole the Spirit Pearl

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.771
and put it in Ao Bing.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.772

Your power is limited
by that hoop.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:48.408
You've no chance.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:50.677

I was holding back
this whole time.

01:27:00.765 --> 01:27:02.815
If anyone deserves to be the

Come on let's get out of here.

01:39:09.411 --> 01:39:12.378
He is ruining my entire plan!

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.114
[grunts]
I'm not done with you.

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:18.484
[Shen] You've not seen
the last of me!

01:39:18.486 --> 01:39:21.154
You're sacrificing yourself
for nothing.

01:39:21.156 --> 01:39:22.322
You dumb or what?

01:39:22.324 --> 01:39:25.325
'Course I am,
I'm your friend after all.

01:39:25.327 --> 01:39:27.026
[chuckles]

01:39:38.673 --> 01:39:41.607

[gasps]

01:40:06.301 --> 01:40:07.467
Huh?

01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:10.303
[both grunt]

01:40:14.642 --> 01:40:17.677
I never expected it could absorb
this amount of power.

01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:19.545
The Chaos Pearl has an appetite.

01:40:23.418 --> 01:40:26.019
[grunting]

01:40:26.021 --> 01:40:28.187
I can't take it.

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.189
[Ne Zha] I'm about to explode!

01:40:35.230 --> 01:40:37.163
[Ao Bing]
You shouldn't have to...

01:40:37.165 --> 01:40:39.532
Let's give it back.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:40.800
[Ne Zha] Right!
[grunts]

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:50.743
[ominous music]

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.547
I can't hold on!

01:40:58.453 --> 01:41:01.187
-Ne Zha! No!
-[grunts]

01:41:02.624 --> 01:41:05.224
How dare they not invite me
to join in...

01:41:08.463 --> 01:41:10.296
I love a good party.

01:41:11.132 --> 01:41:12.465
Stay strong, you two.

01:41:12.467 --> 01:41:13.599
[both gasp]

01:41:18.506 --> 01:41:20.706
[grunting]

01:41:22.777 --> 01:41:23.843
[Taiyi] Open!

01:41:26.648 --> 01:41:28.181
[chiming, clicks]

01:41:32.821 --> 01:41:35.455
[crowd sighing]

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400
Where are you? Ne Zha!

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:10.590
[Ao Bing gasps]

01:42:10.592 --> 01:42:13.192
-How are we alive?
-Ha! We made it!

01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:14.861
[Taiyi] Well, not exactly...

01:42:14.863 --> 01:42:17.830
[grunts]

01:42:17.832 --> 01:42:21.167
The Multi-colored Lotus
couldn't save your bodies...

01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:23.202
but it kept your souls intact.

01:42:23.204 --> 01:42:25.404
Whereas I'm pretty sure
I blew my chance

01:42:25.406 --> 01:42:27.507
at becoming
the 12th Golden Immortal.

01:42:27.509 --> 01:42:29.326
It cost me centuries!

01:42:29.327 --> 01:42:31.144
Now I guess I gotta start over
again from scratch!

01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:33.246
Thank goodness.

01:42:33.248 --> 01:42:36.616
I thought
I'd never see you again!

01:42:36.618 --> 01:42:39.152
[Lady Yin wailing]

01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:48.895
[light music]

01:43:00.675 --> 01:43:02.241
[Taiyi] <i> If you asked me</i>

01:43:02.243 --> 01:43:05.211
<i> whether a person</i>
<i> can alter their fate?</i>

01:43:05.213 --> 01:43:06.546
<i> Well, I don't really know.</i>

01:43:07.649 --> 01:43:10.316
<i> But hey, anything's possible.</i>

01:43:10.318 --> 01:43:12.285
<i> Because a boy named Ne Zha,</i>

01:43:12.287 --> 01:43:13.786
<i> forever changed his.</i>

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:17.957
[upbeat music]

01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:50.756
-[grunting]
-Okay,

01:43:50.758 --> 01:43:52.692
but, are you sure
we can't go out?

01:43:52.694 --> 01:43:54.994
We, we're still waiting
on the signal!

01:43:54.996 --> 01:43:58.231
So uh what exactly
is the signal?

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:00.600
You know...

01:44:00.602 --> 01:44:01.834
That's a good question.

01:44:01.836 --> 01:44:03.302
[both gasp]

01:44:07.008 --> 01:44:08.741
DON'T LEAVE!

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:10.543
THERE'S STILL
POST-CREDITS SCENE!

01:44:12.647 --> 01:44:14.714
[upbeat music]

01:45:25.453 --> 01:45:27.386
[growling]

01:45:28.723 --> 01:45:31.957
[Dragon King] Ao Bing...

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:36.462
Everything we have worked for
was laid to waste.

01:45:36.464 --> 01:45:41.500
And for that, I will make all
of Chentang Pass pay in blood.

01:45:43.604 --> 01:45:46.839
[laughing]
Louder,

01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:50.042
I don't think they can hear you!

01:45:50.044 --> 01:45:52.645
Screaming into the void
like a child

01:45:52.647 --> 01:45:54.714
won't change a thing.

01:45:55.817 --> 01:45:58.551
We trusted you
to secure our freedom,

01:45:58.553 --> 01:46:00.119
and you failed us!

01:46:03.458 --> 01:46:06.625
Would you like to make a deal?

01:46:06.627 --> 01:46:08.794
Dear brother?

01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:11.063
[giggles]

01:46:14.102 --> 01:46:15.468
DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE!

01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:16.602
THERE ARE STILL

Jiang Ziya...

01:49:21.188 --> 01:49:23.322
[shivering]

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:27.660
You know your sin.
