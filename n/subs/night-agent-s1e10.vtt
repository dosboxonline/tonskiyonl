WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:08.800
They're preparing another attack.
We have 24 hours to stop it.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.845
If I'm rescued, the president
will wanna see me, so will Almora.

00:11.928 --> 00:14.764
Zadar's plane lands at 0400
at Joint Base Andrews.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.642
The car will be all set to go.
He'll no longer be a problem.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.396
Open lines of communication
between the three of us lock-fucking-step.

00:21.479 --> 00:22.772
[ominous music playing]

00:22.856 --> 00:24.858
[Redfield screaming]

00:25.775 --> 00:27.110
[Redfield sobbing] Sarah.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.029
Oh no!

00:29.112 --> 00:32.323
-You were supposed to be watching her.
-[Maddie] <i>You did it. Not me, you.</i>

00:32.407 --> 00:35.785
[Redfield] <i>I'm sorry you have to invent</i>
<i>these stories to protect your conscience.</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:38.830
She's my daughter. Yeah, I'll…
I'll get her in line afterward.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.749
What about Sutherland and the niece?

00:40.832 --> 00:42.584
What if they've told someone?

00:42.667 --> 00:45.462
[Rose] There's photos of dozens
of different pages.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.048
These were taken in the Night Action room.
Have a date and time?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.549
[Rose] Farr. She took the photos.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.217
-That's undeniable.
-Peter?

00:51.301 --> 00:54.012
Found information linking Farr
to the murder of Rose's aunt and uncle.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.474
-Have you talked to POTUS or Almora?
-I can't get Almora on his phone.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.060
<i>-What about Zadar's detail?</i>
<i>-</i>The schedule puts him at Blair House.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.605
I called, Blair House says there's
no plans to have anyone there this week.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.815
-Where else would they be keeping him?
-Camp David.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.400
-We have to go.
-Go where?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.819
Camp David.
The president wants to see you, and you.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.947
Mr. Zadar, Secret Service.
Hope you had a good flight.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.158
-How far is Camp David from here?
-Just under an hour.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.827
[Chelsea] I've never seen
those agents before.

01:22.707 --> 01:26.252
Call it off. We know that you, Redfield,
and Wick were behind the metro bombing,

01:26.336 --> 01:27.337
and that all three of you

01:27.420 --> 01:30.340
are planning on killing Zadar
and the president at Camp David.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.508
What are you talking about?

01:31.591 --> 01:32.759
Drop the fucking act.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.011
[Diane] I would never hurt
Michelle Travers.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.514
We're going to Camp David.
You're getting us in.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.516
[music fades]

01:42.352 --> 01:44.354
[ominous music playing]

01:49.776 --> 01:51.319
[basketball bouncing]

01:51.402 --> 01:54.280
[man] All right, Petey.
Let's go, you and me.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.366
[Peter] For real? Wearing that?

01:56.449 --> 01:58.827
Let's see what you're gonna show
those college recruiters.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.787
-You can't guard me.
-[Peter Sr.] Oh yeah?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.039
Prove it.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.626
[both panting]

02:06.709 --> 02:07.627
[Peter grunting]

02:07.710 --> 02:09.087
[Peter Sr. exclaiming]

02:09.170 --> 02:10.630
[car tires screeching]

02:10.713 --> 02:12.090
[car engines revving]

02:14.217 --> 02:16.219
-Dad?
-It's all right.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.012
[sinister music playing]

02:19.097 --> 02:20.598
What's going on here, Alex?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.392
We gotta search your place, Pete.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
You're messing with me, right?

02:25.854 --> 02:27.021
I'm afraid not.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.401
-This isn't funny. In front of my son?
-I'm sorry, Pete.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.319
[indistinct chatter]

02:33.987 --> 02:35.280
-Am I under arrest?
-Arrest?

02:35.363 --> 02:36.197
[Alex] No, no.

02:36.781 --> 02:37.615
Not yet.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.243
For now, I need your hard drives
and your phone.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.870
My hard drives-- For what?

02:41.953 --> 02:43.955
Alex, explain to me what's going on here.

02:44.914 --> 02:45.915
Your phone, Pete.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.835
[Peter Sr. sighing]

02:52.088 --> 02:53.673
-I'm gonna need Petey's too.
-Fuck no.

02:53.756 --> 02:57.302
Hey, I will not have you disrespect
an FBI agent and a friend.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.053
We're all on the same team here.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.388
Now, give him your phone.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.017
-Thanks.
-I'm sorry.

03:04.976 --> 03:05.977
I know, Petey.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.313
I'm sorry too.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.487
[opening theme music playing]

03:30.084 --> 03:32.629
-I know what you're thinking.
-I promise you, you don't.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.964
[Diane] Didn't know about
the metro bombing ahead of time.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.133
I had nothing to do with it.
I was only involved in--

03:37.217 --> 03:38.718
Cover up? Yeah, that's a lot better.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.012
If the public knew about
every fuckup or scandal,

03:41.095 --> 03:42.972
society would collapse on itself.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.766
Don't think for a second
this isn't happening

03:44.849 --> 03:47.685
in every office, every branch
of government, every single fucking day.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.480
"Everybody's corrupt."
"System's fucked beyond repair."

03:50.563 --> 03:52.774
"Why try? I was just doing my job."

03:52.857 --> 03:54.901
Any other bullshit justifications
you wanna throw?

03:54.984 --> 03:58.363
What is my job, Peter,
other than to protect the president?

03:58.446 --> 04:01.491
Is that some moral calculus?
Kill the few to save the many?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.076
Kill the many to save the nation?

04:03.159 --> 04:05.078
I wish I could've stopped
Redfield and Wick

04:05.161 --> 04:06.496
from having the metro bombed.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.624
But covering for it
was non-negotiable for me.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.503
If Travers hadn't ordered a Night Action,
none of this would've happened.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.172
But after we found out
the Campbells met with Zadar,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.299
we had to assume
they told him he was the real target.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.926
The investigation had to be shut down.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.095
You mean good people had to be murdered.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.055
[tense music playing]

04:27.308 --> 04:28.726
Why'd you pick me for Night Action?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.061
I thought I could count on you.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.604
You thought you could control me.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.564
I hoped I wouldn't have to.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.859
You really believe it, don't you?

04:36.943 --> 04:40.071
I keep wondering
how someone could do any of this.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.448
Lie and kill and still sleep at night.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.287
But you've convinced yourself that this
"Sun Tzu fucks Machiavelli" philosophy

04:47.370 --> 04:48.288
was the way to go.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.957
-I don't expect you to understand.
-Oh, I understand perfectly.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.584
You murdered my aunt and uncle

04:53.668 --> 04:55.795
because they found out
what you were doing. That's it.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.339
You weren't watching out
for the country or the president,

04:58.423 --> 04:59.757
you were watching out for you.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.384
So save the ass-covering bullshit

05:01.467 --> 05:03.970
and just be grateful I'm not the one
holding the fucking gun.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
[suspenseful music playing]

05:13.354 --> 05:15.523
[whispering indistinctly]

05:15.606 --> 05:16.524
[whispering] Okay.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.446
-You new?
-Yeah.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.865
-What's your name?
-Walter.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.409
Walter. Should I have packed
for a longer stay?

05:29.078 --> 05:30.830
Just like to be prepared.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.875
Where's Garza?

05:34.917 --> 05:35.752
He called in sick.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.213
You mean "she." She called in sick.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.428
We're all new to this detail.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.559
How are Redfield and Wick gonna do it?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.394
Not sure. Explosives maybe.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.189
That's what was planned
when Zadar was the only target.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.608
I never knew specifics,

05:58.691 --> 06:01.819
but the basic idea is the more confusion,

06:01.903 --> 06:03.738
the more conflicted parties present,

06:03.821 --> 06:05.531
the more potential suspects,

06:05.615 --> 06:08.242
the easier it is to just deny, deny, deny.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.370
Easier to find scapegoats.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.706
The narrative that Zadar was a terrorist
made him an obvious choice.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.627
Cable news, Twitter, and the Elliot Romes
on the Internet will do the rest.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.420
Just like they did with me.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.091
That's why you chose me for Night Action.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
In case shit went sideways for you,
you could use me as a fall guy.

06:35.853 --> 06:36.854
[Rose] What're you doing?

06:36.938 --> 06:39.649
The guards won't let you in
unless you're on the list for the day.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.651
-You on the list?
-No, but I'm the chief of staff.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.236
What about us? How are we getting in?

06:43.319 --> 06:44.570
You'll be in the trunk.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.114
[birds chirping]

06:46.739 --> 06:47.573
Fuck no.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.535
Look, I'm trying to save
my president and my friend,

06:50.618 --> 06:52.995
but you're the ones holding the gun,
so you make the call.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.831
You wanna get into Camp David or not?

06:58.376 --> 07:02.588
-What's she done to earn back your trust?
-It isn't about trust. It's about access.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.050
[suspenseful music playing]

07:10.847 --> 07:12.765
What if she burns us, again?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.268
It's our only way in.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.154
If you fail,
you know how this ends, right?

07:26.237 --> 07:27.989
Dead or alive,
you'll be the one they blame.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.991
The perfect fall guy just like you said.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.826
Just get us in.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.500
[suspenseful music intensifying]

07:46.924 --> 07:49.135
[Redfield] It's gonna be a quick hello
at Laurel Lodge

07:49.218 --> 07:50.678
and then you can go lay down.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.181
The president wants
to see Chelsea too, right?

07:53.264 --> 07:56.517
That'll be after.
She wants a moment with just you first.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.398
Briggs, I need to talk to Almora.
Can I get a comms?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.108
That's a no-go, comms are down.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.318
They're working on it.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.987
Headed to talk to him at Aspen.
I can have him meet you at Laurel.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.280
Just follow Walter.

08:15.828 --> 08:16.954
What did your dad say?

08:17.705 --> 08:19.624
I'm going to see Travers alone.

08:19.707 --> 08:23.085
The second you get within ten feet of her,
you warn her, okay?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.338
Don't give her details,
just tell her she's in danger.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.633
-Where will you be?
-I don't know yet, but I'll find you.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.596
[car engines starting]

[indistinct chatter]

09:01.749 --> 09:03.751
[indistinct chatter]

09:04.627 --> 09:05.753
Maddie, this way.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.507
[Walter] Arrington, over here.

09:12.969 --> 09:13.928
She'll be fine.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.513
Come on.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.598
[tense music playing]

09:32.280 --> 09:33.656
Where is the president?

09:34.615 --> 09:37.577
She's on her way.
I'll explain more in a minute.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.245
[keypad beeping]

09:39.328 --> 09:40.413
[lock clicking]

09:46.794 --> 09:47.878
It's all right, sweetheart.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.805
[lock clicking]

10:09.150 --> 10:10.276
Where's your suitcase?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.991
-Is there a bathroom I could use?
-Sit tight.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.493
It won't be too long.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.996
[intense dramatic flourish playing]

10:28.753 --> 10:30.087
[car window whirring]

10:33.466 --> 10:34.592
I'm Diane Farr.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.512
The president's chief of staff.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.764
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.515
It's fine, but I need to see her.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.936
Your name's not on the list.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.230
I know it's not.
I'm supposed to be somewhere else today.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.484
But an urgent national security issue
just flared up. Call Ben Almora.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.028
Actually, our radios are down.
Something about the comms tower.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.237
[Diane] That's your problem.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.865
I'm here on behalf of the president
and your commander-in-chief.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.867
You've got my credentials,
you checked my vehicle.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.120
Let me through, so I can do my job
helping the leader of the free world.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.123
-All good?
-Almost.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.333
Ma'am, pop the trunk.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.002
[Diane] Oh, for fuck's sake.
I don't have time for this.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.713
Unless you wanna be responsible
for an international crisis,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.173
you need to open the fucking gate,

11:14.256 --> 11:16.425
and I won't ask
for your names and commanding officer.

11:18.886 --> 11:19.720
[man] It's fine.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.722
Have a good day.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.017
[Diane sighing]

11:32.900 --> 11:33.734
This way.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.194
[door creaking]

[lock clicking]

11:40.449 --> 11:42.451
[unsettling music playing]

12:06.517 --> 12:07.893
What is this?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.562
Somewhere we can be safe.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.857
[lock clicking]

12:12.940 --> 12:16.068
-I don't wanna be down here.
-It'll all be over soon, honey.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.027
Promise.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.656
What's happening?

12:21.532 --> 12:24.201
-Why are we here?
-[Redfield] We need to protect ourselves.

12:24.285 --> 12:29.123
Listen, the president
is meeting a man here today.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.499
Omar Zadar.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.960
He's a terrorist, Maddie.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.796
He is the kind of people
we have been fighting for decades.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.924
Now, I've been trying
to explain this to Travers,

12:39.008 --> 12:41.218
but she doesn't understand real politics.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.638
She's soft,
which makes her as dangerous as him.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.391
I don't understand.
If he's so dangerous, why is he here?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.309
[Redfield] Exactly.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.937
With all the blood on Zadar's hands,
who knows what could happen?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.898
So we need to be ready.

12:53.981 --> 12:54.940
Ready for what?

12:55.024 --> 12:59.361
This is the safest place at Camp David,
so we just need to sit for now.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.448
Just… just sit tight and… and wait.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.992
Dad, what did you do?

13:05.493 --> 13:06.535
[Redfield] I made mistakes.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.703
Too many to count.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.083
When Sarah died, I--

13:13.167 --> 13:17.129
There was all this pain and rage,
and I didn't know what to do with it,

13:17.213 --> 13:19.715
and I… and I… I put it all on you.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.009
I was fucking awful.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.345
Why are you talking about Sarah?

13:24.428 --> 13:28.724
Because, honey, it was never your fault.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.684
It was all mine, Maddie.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.938
[Maddie sobbing]

13:36.273 --> 13:37.900
[Redfield] It was always my fault…

13:39.109 --> 13:40.694
[voice breaking] …and I am so…

13:42.404 --> 13:44.615
so sorry.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.408
[Redfield kissing]

13:46.909 --> 13:48.494
This will be all over soon.

13:48.994 --> 13:53.791
I just need you
not to ask me any more questions, okay?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.672
I want a new beginning.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.759
Please.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.262
[suspenseful music playing]

14:15.646 --> 14:17.022
Stay down until I find Almora.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.900
-Where's the attack gonna be?
-In a group setting, indoors.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.901
Wait here.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.781
[Ben] Diane?
What the hell are you doing here?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.783
-I have to talk to POTUS.
-How'd you get here?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.202
There's no fucking time, Ben.
The president is in danger.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.121
Diane, answer the question.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.044
Wait, there's no detail here.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.880
Meaning?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.339
Travers isn't in there.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.258
Let's go.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.721
-[Diane] Where is she?
-She's rolling calls in the Rosebud.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.181
We need to evacuate her
from Camp David now.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.351
Evacuate? In 15 minutes,
she's meeting with Zadar.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.061
There's a bomb on the property.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.272
[Ben] That's impossible.
This place is a fortress.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.773
It's happening from the inside.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.567
-You know this how?
-[Diane] Listen to me.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.402
There is a bomb at Camp David.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.280
We need to evacuate Travers.
Call her detail.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.198
I can't. The comms are down.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.826
You're not supposed to be here, Miss Farr.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.162
-[Diane grunting]
-[Ben] Fuck.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.121
[both grunting]

15:14.747 --> 15:16.957
-[both grunting, straining]
-[intense music playing]

[Ben coughing]

15:48.155 --> 15:49.156
Oh my God.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.575
-[Peter] Here.
-[Diane groaning]

15:52.618 --> 15:53.452
Hello?

15:54.078 --> 15:54.912
[radio static]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.246
The comms are still down.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.623
[Diane groaning]

15:58.832 --> 16:00.709
[Diane] There's a communications building.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.713
Everything at Camp David
runs through there.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.839
Wick would know to hit it.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.800
Well, if it's a cyberattack,
maybe I can fix it.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.176
Where is it?

16:09.259 --> 16:11.679
-[Nathan] We're secure?
-[Walter] <i>Closed frequency. Go ahead.</i>

16:11.762 --> 16:14.014
I need backup east of Aspen Lodge.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.850
Sutherland is here.
Laurel Lodge, you're closest. Do you copy?

16:16.934 --> 16:17.768
[Walter] <i>Copy.</i>

16:17.851 --> 16:18.811
Still tied up here.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.398
Guess comms are back up.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.692
Can I talk to Almora now?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.156
[Nathan] Fine, we'll go now.
Boyle, how long?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.658
[suspenseful music playing]

16:32.741 --> 16:34.118
[Nathan] <i>Boyle, can you hear me?</i>

16:35.119 --> 16:36.412
[Boyle] <i>They're five minutes out.</i>

16:36.495 --> 16:38.038
All right. Setting for ten then.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.919
In three, two, one.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.547
All set.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.507
[Walter grunting]

16:49.591 --> 16:51.093

[Walter groaning]

17:16.577 --> 17:18.579
[indistinct chatter]

17:21.498 --> 17:23.542
Has anyone seen a black hard-shell case?

17:24.168 --> 17:25.044
Anyone?

17:25.836 --> 17:26.670
God.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.256
You don't need to do
whatever you're about--

17:29.339 --> 17:33.135
It's a war, about ideas, about freedom.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.553
You understand?

17:34.636 --> 17:37.765
The president is now the enemy.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.434
I'll protect you though.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.479
Dad, please…

17:45.147 --> 17:46.690
stop whatever it is.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.612
Even if I… I could,

17:53.197 --> 17:54.907
there's no stopping it now.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.992
[sinister music playing]

17:59.912 --> 18:01.705
[suspenseful music playing]

18:02.414 --> 18:04.083
[birds chirping]

18:11.048 --> 18:11.882
Sam, is that you?

18:11.965 --> 18:14.093
No, but Sam sent us
to see if you need any help.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.929
[man] Not unless you know something
about military-grade communications.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.555
It's your lucky day.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.058
Does this building
also handle cell service?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.852
Cellular, Wi-Fi, UHF, VHF.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.979
Looks like an outside hack.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.190
If the Russians knew this was down,
we'd have a problem.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.316
Mind if I have a look?

18:33.737 --> 18:35.531
[keyboard clacking]

18:38.117 --> 18:39.076
This is a mess.

18:39.159 --> 18:42.412
You said that this building covers
all radio waves on the property?

18:42.496 --> 18:44.706
Yeah, everything but air traffic.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.749
Why?

18:45.833 --> 18:49.545
If the communication's down,
there's no way to hack this remotely.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.963
-You have to--
-Connect directly.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.965
[both grunting]

18:57.302 --> 18:58.595

[Peter roaring]

19:07.354 --> 19:08.689
[panting] You all right?

19:08.772 --> 19:09.898
Yeah, you?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.359
-How many more of them are there?
-[Peter] No idea.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.486
Looks like he's still got his walkie,

19:14.570 --> 19:16.530
which means that
not all the comms are down.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.407
If they are, they're not coming from here.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.534
They must be running
their own closed channel.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.369
Think you can get this up and running?

19:22.452 --> 19:23.912
-I'll try my best.
-Good.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
[cell phone vibrating]

19:27.332 --> 19:28.167
Yeah?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.377
-[Nathan]<i> Farr showed up</i>
<i>with Sutherland and the girl.</i>

19:30.460 --> 19:32.379
I had to take care of Farr and Almora,

19:32.462 --> 19:35.340
but this is going sideways.
I think we might be fucked.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.718
-Is Redfield in place?
-[Nathan] <i>Yeah, I dialed it in.</i>

19:39.011 --> 19:41.471
-We have six minutes.
<i>-</i>Hey, you got this.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.557
I didn't have a choice, right?

19:43.640 --> 19:44.850
[Gordon] <i>Do what it takes,</i>

19:44.933 --> 19:46.768
and I'll be here when it's over.

[suspenseful music playing]

19:58.697 --> 20:00.949
[car door opening, closing]

20:06.955 --> 20:10.626
These must be for the data network.
That means this router is radio comms.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.628
If I can console this, get it working,

20:12.711 --> 20:14.880
I can get Secret Service
talking to each other.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.965
-Great, do that.
-[Nathan] <i>We are a go.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:18.675
POTUS should be arriving any minute.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.885
What?

20:19.968 --> 20:21.887
[Nathan] <i>Confirm the case</i>
<i>is still in position.</i>

20:23.180 --> 20:25.265
Confirm the case is still in position.

20:29.978 --> 20:30.812
Confirmed.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.522
Anyone have eyes on Sutherland?

20:34.107 --> 20:35.108
He's not here.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.861
After the press conference,
I was hoping we could have a talk,

20:37.945 --> 20:39.279
just the two of us.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.406
Of course.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.158
Boyle, you on track?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.701

<i>If for any reason</i>
<i>the first one does not hit</i>,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.501
<i>be ready for our contingency.</i>
<i>Four minutes.</i>

20:52.584 --> 20:54.753
I'll be in position
in the woods south of Laurel Lodge.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.755
-Peter, what's going on?
-It's starting.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.924
So just stay here.
See if you can get the comms up.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.884
-Where are you going?
-I'm gonna try to stop it.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.094

21:12.020 --> 21:13.689
I'm sorry, do you need to be here?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.233
Secret Service.
Is the meeting happening in this lodge?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.527
No, but there's a photo op happening
before the luncheon.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.862
-What are you looking for?
-A black Pelican case.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.324

their equipment in the other room.

Stop what you're doing
and find the exit.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.620
President Travers is on her way here.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.498
There's a bomb in this building.
You need to get everyone out now.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.916
Right now. Go.

[music fades]

22:20.005 --> 22:23.175
I mean, what if I wanna leave right now?

22:23.258 --> 22:26.511
Well, why would you wanna do that?
Uh, it's not safe up there.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.555
-We're a team.
-I can't do this anymore.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.391
-Do what?
-Smile like everything is normal.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.393
I won't.

Maddie… it's about to happen.

-I can't be a part.
-You won't survive.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.066
Open it!

Tell him to open it.

[tense music playing]

22:46.323 --> 22:47.866
I won't keep this secret.

I'll tell everyone everything,

24:36.141 --> 24:38.143
-Maddie?
-Chel-- Chelsea?

24:38.935 --> 24:40.270
[Chelsea] What's the code?

24:41.229 --> 24:43.732
Four-six-one-seven.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.609
[keypad beeping, chiming]

24:47.486 --> 24:49.112

[intense music swelling]

24:57.954 --> 24:59.873
[all screaming]

25:00.957 --> 25:02.250
What the hell?

25:03.376 --> 25:04.419
[Nathan grunting]

25:04.503 --> 25:05.712
Hey, stop!

25:08.465 --> 25:11.426
[both groaning, breathing heavily]

25:15.597 --> 25:16.640
It's done.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.185
Mr. President?

25:24.606 --> 25:27.359
This is unit one evacuating.
Headed to Marine One.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.110
[suspenseful music playing]

25:29.194 --> 25:30.487
[indistinct shouting]

25:32.864 --> 25:33.698
Briggs, you copy?

25:34.282 --> 25:36.117
-Go for Briggs.
-[man] <i>We're go for contingency.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.036
<i>Evacuating POTUS to Marine One now.</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:41.623
Abort, okay? Repeat, abort contingency.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.668
Too late, it's already done.
Rigged to go on wheels up.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.213
[soldier] <i>We got a suspect loose..</i>

25:48.296 --> 25:50.382
<i>White male, twenties.</i>
<i>Last seen near Rosebud,</i>

25:50.465 --> 25:52.092
headed east on foot. Armed and dangerous.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.261
<i>-Shoot on sight.</i>
-Don't shoot, don't shoot.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.220
<i>Who's this?</i>

25:55.720 --> 25:58.974
All units, comms are compromised.
I repeat, comms are compromised.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.559
Shit.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.311
[intense music playing]

26:20.912 --> 26:22.914
[helicopter engine powering up]

26:29.629 --> 26:31.464
Look out. Behind you.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.549
<i>Sutherland's here.</i>

26:35.385 --> 26:36.886
-[man] Drop it, now.
-Listen to me!

26:36.970 --> 26:39.806
There's a bomb on Marine One!
It's rigged to blow on lift off!

26:39.889 --> 26:41.766
-Drop it.
-[Peter] Not until you kill the engine!

26:41.850 --> 26:42.809
[Michelle] It's okay.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.186
-What do you want, Peter?
-I don't wanna hurt you, ma'am.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.939
-Drop the fucking gun.
-Not until you kill the fucking engines!

26:48.023 --> 26:49.024
Kill the engines.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.402
Pilot, clear the chopper.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.487
[helicopter engines powering down]

27:07.876 --> 27:12.505
Listen to me. I'll drop the gun
after you clear the helo, okay?

27:12.589 --> 27:13.632
There's a bomb on board.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.384
That agent was involved,
Briggs was involved,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.720
the vice president's involved.
He's trying to kill you.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.556
-They're trying to kill the president!
-[man] You're holding a gun.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.601
-Just clear the fucking helo!
-We will once you drop your weapon.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.561
I drop this, they shoot me.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.482
Please. I promise, ma'am,
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.442
Just check the cabin.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.028
Do it.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.405
Check the chopper for IEDs.

27:38.907 --> 27:39.741
[Rose] Peter!

27:39.824 --> 27:41.534
[soldiers] Let me see your hands!

27:41.618 --> 27:43.745
-Hands up!
-Don't kill her. She's not involved.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.164
-She's not involved.
-You don't have to do this.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.417
I don't wanna hurt you, ma'am, okay?
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

27:50.752 --> 27:51.670
I love my country.

27:58.885 --> 27:59.719
Nothing here.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.764
That's it. There's nothing on the chopper.

28:02.847 --> 28:03.973
Drop the weapon now.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.768
It's on there! Check it again!
Check it right now!

[suspenseful music swelling]

28:18.363 --> 28:19.239
[soldier 2] Wait.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.743
What is it?

28:23.827 --> 28:25.245
[soldier 2] <i>We found something.</i>

28:27.997 --> 28:28.832
What are they saying?

28:30.959 --> 28:32.961
What are they saying?!

28:38.258 --> 28:39.968
Clear the area! Get down!

28:40.051 --> 28:42.053
[all screaming]

28:48.768 --> 28:50.770
[tense music playing]

29:06.578 --> 29:08.413
[high-pitched ringing]

29:15.795 --> 29:16.796
Stay down.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.592
Stay down.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.593
Stay down.

29:26.848 --> 29:27.974
[man] This way, ma'am.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.894
No! Wait!

29:30.977 --> 29:32.437
[soldier] Stop! Stop right there!

29:34.856 --> 29:36.191
Stand down! He's with us!

29:36.274 --> 29:39.110
Please, listen, I can explain everything.
Please stop.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.069
[Chelsea] It's okay.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.363
Peter. [panting]

29:44.324 --> 29:45.158
Hey.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.744
-You good?
-Are you?

29:48.912 --> 29:50.497
Yeah, yeah.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.207
I'm good.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.917
[Rose] You sure?

29:54.501 --> 29:56.211
[chuckling] Because you look like shit.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.047
[both chuckling]

29:59.672 --> 30:01.174
[Peter wincing]

30:02.258 --> 30:04.260
[dramatic music playing]

30:07.972 --> 30:09.724
[man] Down this way. Over here.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.559
Thank God.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.479
Found him.

30:14.562 --> 30:17.148
We heard screaming,
and then somebody said "bomb,"

30:17.232 --> 30:18.733
and then we heard an explosion.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.193
Two explosions, sir.

30:20.693 --> 30:21.611
My daughter?

30:22.779 --> 30:23.613
Maddie?

30:24.322 --> 30:25.949
-Is she--?
-[Chelsea] She's fine.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.787
Wanna say hi?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.427
[fire crackling]

30:47.554 --> 30:48.721
[footsteps approaching]

30:58.189 --> 30:59.732
I heard the explosion.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.195
Is she alive?

31:04.279 --> 31:08.324
Look at you, lying here like this
and still thinking of others.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.618
I'm so sorry.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.120
You know what?

31:13.621 --> 31:14.789
I believe you.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.624
And still…

31:18.209 --> 31:20.003
I can't wait to see you dead.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.963
I deserve it.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.138
[tense music playing]

31:32.974 --> 31:34.017
You deserve worse.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.184
[Diane yelping]

31:36.686 --> 31:40.106
Which is why I'm gonna keep you alive
until the paramedics come.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.900
And when you're standing trial,

31:42.859 --> 31:44.652
I'll be in the front row watching,

31:45.361 --> 31:48.573
while you clear Peter's name
and tell the world what you all did.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.201
And then you'll go to prison.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.663
Kids in school will learn to despise you.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.501
And one day, many, many years from now…

32:02.128 --> 32:02.962
you'll die…

32:04.088 --> 32:04.964
alone…

32:06.633 --> 32:08.217
and then I'll get my wish.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.720
Until then…

32:13.264 --> 32:15.016
I'm just gonna have to be patient.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.353
[Diane yelling, wincing]

32:19.312 --> 32:21.314
[dramatic music playing]

32:31.324 --> 32:32.241
[door opening]

32:35.787 --> 32:36.704
Peter.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.206
Rose.

32:38.873 --> 32:39.832
Please come in.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.795
Wouldn't blame you if you never set foot
in this building again.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.923
Not at all, Madam President.
It's an honor, always.

32:47.715 --> 32:48.967
Why don't you have a seat?

32:54.138 --> 32:58.142
Now, I understand why you're trying
to stay anonymous through all this,

32:58.226 --> 33:01.980
but it pains me not to be able
to say thank you in front of the world.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.483
Well, life's easier
when no one's paying attention to you.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.151
I'm inclined to agree.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.862
-Any news on Gordon Wick?
-[Michelle] Not yet.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.739
We'll find him though.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.993
Now, if you won't let me
pin a medal on you,

33:15.076 --> 33:17.078
there's gotta be something
I can do for you.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.413
Anything.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.081
Name it.

33:28.214 --> 33:30.258
I wanna know the truth about my father.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.803
[contemplative music playing]

33:39.976 --> 33:41.102
[man] Agent Arrington?

33:41.894 --> 33:42.729
[Chelsea] Sir.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.814
Congratulations on the appointment.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.608
Terrible circumstances, but thank you.

33:49.318 --> 33:51.696
Still hard to believe.
Two of the very best.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.492
Look, I know you're on leave,

33:56.576 --> 33:58.745
but I wanted to call you in

33:58.828 --> 34:02.040
to see if maybe you'd like to say
a few words tomorrow at the ceremony.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.917
-Me?
<i>-</i>I didn't know Monks personally.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.836
The person who knew him best was Almora.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.713
I didn't know Erik very long.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.008
Understood. Just thought I'd offer.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.469
-Everyone is aware--
-Actually…

34:16.054 --> 34:16.888
sure.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.057
-I'd like that.
-[man] Good.

34:19.932 --> 34:22.435
I want you to know
that when you're ready to come back,

34:22.518 --> 34:24.729
the president has
a spot for you on her detail.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.357
That comes at her personal invitation.

34:28.941 --> 34:29.859
[Chelsea exhaling]

34:31.486 --> 34:32.320
I--

34:32.820 --> 34:34.197
Thank you, sir.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.616
Um, I'll need to think about it.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.369
I want it.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.457
Details to come.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.542
[triumphant music playing]

34:53.925 --> 34:55.802
-Sorry I'm late.
-No worries.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.387
Feels good to have some time alone.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.972
[indistinct chatter]

35:02.809 --> 35:05.144
You know it's not your job
to protect me anymore, right?

35:06.229 --> 35:09.440
Not sure who'll take longer
to adjust to our new normal, me or you?

35:09.524 --> 35:13.903
I heard Travers offered to extend
your protection, even after you testify.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.239
Yeah. I turned her down.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.406
[Chelsea] I heard that too.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.367
Why?

35:20.243 --> 35:22.787
Need to start learning
how to take care of myself.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.747
Fair enough.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.334
So, what are you gonna do? Back to school?

35:28.417 --> 35:29.252
Travel.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.003
Study the masters in Rome maybe?

35:31.087 --> 35:32.797
The farther away the better.

35:34.507 --> 35:35.341
You?

35:37.760 --> 35:38.803
Actually…

35:40.930 --> 35:42.306
I got a new gig.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.607
[keypad chiming]

[tense music playing]

36:19.886 --> 36:21.345
[man] <i>Please state your name.</i>

<i>-I understand.</i>

36:39.363 --> 36:44.994
[man] <i>The first time you were approached</i>
<i>by a foreign agent was in 2004, yes?</i>

36:45.536 --> 36:46.370
[Peter Sr.] <i>Correct.</i>

36:46.454 --> 36:50.833
[man] <i>And did you know at that time</i>
<i>that these individuals were foreign agents</i>

36:50.917 --> 36:52.877
<i>seeking to undermine</i>
<i>the American interests?</i>

36:52.960 --> 36:54.503
<i>No, not then.</i>

36:55.296 --> 36:56.214
<i>No.</i>

36:56.923 --> 36:58.591
[man] <i>At what point did you know?</i>

37:01.219 --> 37:03.012

37:05.139 --> 37:06.224
<i>when I was offered payment.</i>

37:07.099 --> 37:08.351
[man] <i>Payment for what?</i>

37:08.851 --> 37:12.688
[Peter Sr.] <i>Information</i>
<i>on, uh, private contractors.</i>

37:12.772 --> 37:16.400
<i>Commercial stuff</i>
<i>I… I figured wouldn't lead anywhere.</i>

37:16.484 --> 37:18.152
[man] <i>And where did it lead?</i>

37:24.367 --> 37:25.201
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:28.329
[man] <i>Where did it lead?</i>

[dramatic music playing]

37:49.267 --> 37:50.351
[door opening]

37:54.146 --> 37:55.022
Thank you…

37:56.524 --> 37:59.068
for, um… for doing that.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.195
I know it isn't what you wanted to learn.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.449
Maybe it was, actually.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.328
What made me so angry
was the idea that he was innocent,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.330
but he died before he could prove it.

38:12.915 --> 38:15.001
But hearing him confess, it, uh…

38:15.543 --> 38:18.379
[Michelle] Would you like to know why
your father was cooperating on tape?

38:19.588 --> 38:21.674
He'd agreed to become a double agent.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.926
He was in the process
of being prepped for deployment,

38:24.010 --> 38:26.679
but the plan backfired
when he was killed by a foreign assassin

38:26.762 --> 38:28.097
to stop him from helping us.

but are of vital importance.

I'm gonna call you, okay?
