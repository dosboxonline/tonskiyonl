15:34.041 --> 15:35.709
this isn't a troop deployment,

15:35.792 --> 15:38.500
-or a, a market crash.
-(thuds)

15:40.500 --> 15:41.959
(exhales)

15:42.041 --> 15:45.959
The Prime Minister
will not be taking
a position on the Touched.

15:46.041 --> 15:49.750
Nor will he allow any official
debate on the subject.

15:49.834 --> 15:54.000
Not until we understand
the nature and breadth
of the attack.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.792
-Attack?
-You're declaring the Touched

15:56.875 --> 15:58.959
a direct threat
against the empire.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.542
-(thuds)
-Which we here
are sworn to protect.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.375
All:
Contra hostes omnes.

16:04.458 --> 16:08.166
And this attack is expected
to come...

16:08.250 --> 16:10.333
It came three years ago.

16:10.417 --> 16:13.834
Third of August, 1896.

16:13.917 --> 16:18.000
A Monday. Rather gray.

16:18.083 --> 16:22.166
Not one case of someone
being Touched before then.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.375
Not one outside London.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.166
Those reported overseas
were all here at the time.

16:27.250 --> 16:31.417
And not one man
of stature afflicted.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.208
That's the genius of it.

16:35.291 --> 16:38.500
They came at us
through our women.

16:38.583 --> 16:39.959
Lord Allaven-Tyne:
"They"?

16:40.041 --> 16:42.709
I'm still not sure
I can equate a few
bizarre anecdotes

16:42.792 --> 16:43.959
with the Mongol horde.

16:44.041 --> 16:47.041
Only a blind man measures
the length of a blade

16:47.125 --> 16:48.709
by how much is in his belly.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.667
-Your overstep the mark, Massen.
-This was designed

16:51.750 --> 16:54.166
so that we would see
the parts...

16:54.250 --> 16:56.208
and not the whole.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.625
Philanthropists
like Lavinia Bidlow

16:58.709 --> 17:01.000
see the suffering
of the afflicted.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.166
The common throng see
a macabre murderess.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.375
And you see a broken machine.
(laughs)

17:06.458 --> 17:09.000
That is exactly what I see.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.542
The greatest machine.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.667
The heart of our empire
brought to a shuddering halt

17:13.750 --> 17:16.500
by the caprice
and ambitions of those

17:16.583 --> 17:19.625
for whom ambition
was never meant.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.583
-(thuds)
-Industrialist:
This is the Age of Power.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.375
-New power.
-The X-ray.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.500
-The wireless.
-Electricity.

17:27.583 --> 17:31.667
We are the first generation
accustomed to the impossible.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.917
What women are
appalled by today,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.417
they will accept tomorrow,

17:35.500 --> 17:38.125
and demand the day after that.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.625
And the immigrant.
And the deviant.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.417
-(thuds)
-That is the power
being wielded,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.208
and not by us.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.959
The blade is in, gentlemen.

17:51.041 --> 17:54.834
We need to know whose hand
is on the hilt.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.667
(indistinct chatter)

17:59.959 --> 18:01.667
Nobody gets through.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.500
-(metal clanging)
-(shovels digging)

18:13.542 --> 18:15.041
Foreman:
Put your back into it, Jones,

18:15.125 --> 18:17.333
-you lazy--
-Jones: Yes, sir.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.959
Foreman:
We get any further behind,
I'll pluck the lot of ya!

18:20.041 --> 18:23.375
Not in front of the officer.
Show some respect.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.959
Detective Mundi.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.458
You're the Special Detail, yeah?

18:29.542 --> 18:32.083
-You're gonna wanna see this.
-Am I?

18:34.250 --> 18:35.709
Mind your head.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.875
(rats squeaking)

18:41.959 --> 18:43.792
Was a digger stumbled on her.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.542
Near had a kiss, they did.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.166
Here. You see the stab wounds?

18:51.542 --> 18:53.959
These mates brung
the torches in.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.875
They spotted this on the wall.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.208
That's how they knew
it was one of hers.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.875
It's a message.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.375
Not from Maladie.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.500
But how can you be sure?

19:05.583 --> 19:07.208
She can spell.

19:08.417 --> 19:11.667
Did he recognize the victim?
The digger?

19:11.750 --> 19:12.875
No.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.583
Well, not much to recognize,
the rats having had a go.

19:15.667 --> 19:19.792
You get vagrants and drunks
taking shelter down here
all the time.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.417
Mmm. This woman was neither.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.208
Where does this lead?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.583
Foreman:
It was meant to be
the maintenance tunnel

19:27.667 --> 19:29.834
for the southern line,
but it got scrapped.

19:29.917 --> 19:32.875
There's too much to do,
expanding the underground.

19:34.917 --> 19:37.542
The city'll fall in on itself.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.458
I don't envy you this job.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.166
-Yeah.
-Who moved the body?

19:41.250 --> 19:44.291
Must have been--
Wait. What?

19:44.375 --> 19:48.166
-No, it was there.
-She wasn't killed there.

19:48.250 --> 19:52.000
And her blood's been dry
a lot longer than this pig's.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.458
No. It's not-- Oi.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.458
You're tossing about
a lot of assumptions.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.500
Clearly I meant to.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.041
Right. Shut this lot down.
Line 'em up.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.750
-No--
-We check every man in here

20:01.834 --> 20:03.333
for blood on his hands
or his clothes.

20:03.417 --> 20:06.041
You, you can't stop the dig.
We got a schedule to keep.

20:06.125 --> 20:08.542
And what's a murder to that, eh?

20:08.625 --> 20:12.542
What? You think you're
the first to try and pin
something on Maladie?

20:12.625 --> 20:15.709
People think every Touched
they meet might be her.

20:15.792 --> 20:18.625
And some of them Touched,
they're weird enough.
They are.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.583
Make your skin crawl.
But here's you,

20:21.667 --> 20:25.917
letting a killer get off
by making it harder
to catch another one.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.709
-For a schedule.
-I know about you,
Frank Mundi.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.208
East End Ape.
Always fists first.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.250
He could beat a confession
out of a headstone.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.959
You can play the righteous man,

20:36.041 --> 20:37.917
but even you answer to someone.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.917
Yes, I do.
She's right there.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.417
Now, that woman faced
an horrible end.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.417
And I don't think
you killed her,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.375
but I'm not letting you
bury her.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.750
What about the Special Detail?

20:51.834 --> 20:54.208
If it's not Maladie done this,
then it's not your case.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.458
-Oh, no. Maladie done this,
didn't she?
-(grunts)

20:56.542 --> 20:58.125
Because she left a message.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.041
So you're gonna tell me
what was here before
you dressed it up,

21:01.125 --> 21:04.291
'cause one more lie,
and I'm not on a case,

21:04.375 --> 21:07.458
I'm the fucking
"Angle" of Death.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.709
(indistinct chatter)

21:13.750 --> 21:17.709
♪

21:26.500 --> 21:29.709
(indistinct chatter)

21:36.417 --> 21:37.792
Leave the doors!

21:37.875 --> 21:40.667
Mrs. True's back
with a new one.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.875
They's in Penance's--
uh, the prolatype.

21:43.959 --> 21:46.250
What, the auto-carriage?
(laughs)

21:46.333 --> 21:49.166
It's mad.
Primrose, you got to see.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.333
Mother says motorcars
are common.

21:51.417 --> 21:54.583
Common? There's only eight
of them that ever were.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.083
I wouldn't expect you
to understand,

21:56.166 --> 21:57.625
but Mother says
they're a blight.

21:57.709 --> 22:00.291
Yeah? She say that lately?

22:00.375 --> 22:02.417
On a visit, maybe,
that we all missed.

22:02.500 --> 22:06.083
-As though you know anything
about being a mother.
-Harriet: Primrose!

22:09.667 --> 22:13.208
-She didn't mean that.
-Does she think she's
too big for a spanking?

22:13.291 --> 22:15.583
Penance:
Coming through!

22:19.667 --> 22:22.250
(indistinct chatter)

22:25.709 --> 22:27.917
(speaks foreign languages)

22:28.000 --> 22:30.041
Horatio:
All right.
All right, come on.

22:30.125 --> 22:33.792
Don't suffocate them.
It's only a carriage.

22:34.792 --> 22:35.917
No?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.542
That's fuckin' amazing.

22:37.625 --> 22:40.417
Myrtle, this is
Dr. Horatio Cousens.
He swears a lot.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.709
-(speaks foreign languages)
-No, I don't.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.667
-How was your journey?
-Eventful.

22:47.542 --> 22:50.375
Lucy, I need to send a letter
to Mrs. Bidlow.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.875
Let her know about the attack.

22:51.959 --> 22:53.500
Lucy:
Attack? What attack?

22:53.583 --> 22:55.542
Lucy. Pen. Paper.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.875
I'll set up in your rooms.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.750
-Shop talk first.
-Not first.

22:58.834 --> 23:00.417
This is just a scratch.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.458
(laughs)

23:05.917 --> 23:08.083
-Primrose?
-I can't ride it in,

23:08.166 --> 23:09.750
-so I don't see what--
-No, it's just--

23:09.834 --> 23:13.417
I recalled you saying
you didn't have anyone
your own age to talk to.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.959
Oh!

23:19.000 --> 23:21.083
I'm Miss Chattoway.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.583
But you may call me Primrose.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.792
I hope we'll be friends.

23:24.875 --> 23:27.917
So what's your "turn"?
I'm large.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.750
(speaks foreign languages)

23:30.834 --> 23:33.458
Myrtle has a language situation,

23:33.542 --> 23:35.583
and I imagine
she could use a cup of tea.

23:35.667 --> 23:38.625
Oh. Um, do you want--

23:38.709 --> 23:40.834
She does speak English.

23:41.875 --> 23:43.750
But not with her mouth.

23:43.834 --> 23:45.834
(speaks foreign languages)

23:45.917 --> 23:48.500
All right. Come with me.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.542
(rooster crows)

23:52.667 --> 23:54.709
We should be married in this.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.458
Lucy:
How is this new?

23:59.542 --> 24:02.041
People been attacking us
since they known we was Touched.

24:02.125 --> 24:04.750
-Or since always.
-Amalia: This is different.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.291
This whole day.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.083
We knew people would
come down on us
the more we were thriving.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.000
Why would they want this...

24:12.083 --> 24:13.417
Myrtle?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.375
Amalia:
I don't think she's the first.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.500
I think they've been
doing this for some time.

24:17.583 --> 24:20.458
All those girls we went after
who'd "just run away"?

24:20.542 --> 24:22.083
(sighs)
Lord.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.667
We need to bolster our security.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.000
All entrances, windows
bolted or blocked.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.000
I could rig up
a few surprises, as well.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.250
Nothing lethal,
but very discouraging.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.834
Everyone signs in and out.
Time and destination.

24:34.917 --> 24:36.500
No one goes out alone
or after dark.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.333
-Not even visitors.
-One time.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.250
I've been showing the girls
a bit of scrapping.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.667
-You'll show them all.
-But not using their "turns."

24:43.750 --> 24:45.709
Well, there's plenty you can do
with what's at hand.

24:45.792 --> 24:48.500
It's about confidence.
As my mum used to say,

24:48.583 --> 24:50.333
if you can look a man
in the eye,

24:50.417 --> 24:51.792
you can stab him in it.

24:51.875 --> 24:53.000
Smart woman.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.000
But also, don't do that.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.250
The Beggar King.
Tell him I need to see him.

24:59.959 --> 25:01.250
We pay him for protection,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.458
and he's been feeding us
potential candidates.

25:03.542 --> 25:05.875
I need to know if
he's been feeding
anyone else.

25:05.959 --> 25:09.208
Here, first thing tomorrow.
Put word on the street.

25:09.291 --> 25:11.291
That's not how it works,
Mrs. True.

25:11.375 --> 25:14.375
Amalia, you don't just ask
the Beggar King to come calling.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.959
I am, in fact, not asking.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.500
All right.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.875
Better tend to that scratch,

25:21.959 --> 25:24.583
since you're in such a hurry
to make new enemies.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.792
-(church bell chimes)
-(indistinct chatter)

25:30.291 --> 25:32.250
(knocking on door)

25:35.083 --> 25:36.750
(knocking continues)

25:38.709 --> 25:40.250
(grunts softly)

25:45.792 --> 25:48.291
(grunts, exhales)

25:53.333 --> 25:55.000
(clattering)

25:57.667 --> 25:59.458
(grunts)

26:00.917 --> 26:02.834
(clanging)

26:02.917 --> 26:04.750
(liquid bubbling)

26:04.834 --> 26:07.166
(groaning)

26:08.667 --> 26:10.500
(panting)

26:13.000 --> 26:14.250
(snorts)

26:14.333 --> 26:16.500
Valet:
Augustus Bidlow
to see you, sir.

26:16.583 --> 26:19.125
(groans, exhales)

26:21.333 --> 26:24.083
(groans, yawns)

26:24.166 --> 26:27.834
Augie, sorry
I kept you waiting.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.291
Did I keep you waiting?
I'm at odds with time.

26:31.375 --> 26:33.125
They're unhappy.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.959
Who? The Humphries?
Of course they're unhappy.
They're old.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.834
The crows.

26:37.917 --> 26:40.542
-They shouldn't be
massing here.
-Hugo: Crows...

26:40.625 --> 26:43.959
-Do you mean to say
we're witnessing a murder?
-(groans)

26:44.041 --> 26:45.959
You know I hate that term.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.625
So unfair,
"a murder of crows."

26:48.709 --> 26:50.625
Crows are actually lovely.
They're intelligent creatures.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.500
Why is it an
"exaltation of larks"?

26:52.583 --> 26:54.750
-Larks are not at all as soc--
-Hugo: Not at all as social.

26:54.834 --> 26:57.250
Yes, Augie, your radical stance
on avian nomenclature

26:57.333 --> 27:00.166
-hasn't changed since Eton.
-No, thank you.

27:02.375 --> 27:05.625
I think they're here
as a Greek chorus
to your distemper.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.792
-(sighs)
-So...

27:07.875 --> 27:10.208
what has you so ruffled?

27:10.291 --> 27:13.458
I assume your sister
is angry about something.

27:13.542 --> 27:14.417
No.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.208
I just-- I, I've done
something stupid.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.291
And that's not why she's--

27:19.375 --> 27:20.834
(sighs)
Fu--

27:20.917 --> 27:22.542
(sips, gulps)

27:22.625 --> 27:24.542
She-- This.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.291
(clears throat)
You know Lavinia's
charity endeavor?

27:28.375 --> 27:29.500
The Touched.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.333
Yes. The, uh...

27:31.417 --> 27:33.208
-The Orphanage.
-Orphans. Right.

27:33.291 --> 27:36.500
-No. The Touched.
-Yes. They're terrible.

27:36.583 --> 27:38.417
(sighs)
They're wonderful.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.667
They're absurd.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.125
Do you even know
what the term means?

27:42.208 --> 27:44.500
"Touched"? Yes!
(laughs) No.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.542
Uh, they're all,
uh, they have,

27:46.625 --> 27:48.875
uh, weird, um,
deformities and afflictions.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.917
And-- Oh! Um.
Alderton Musgrove has
a niece who can float.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.375
-Really?
-(laughs) Yeah.

27:53.458 --> 27:54.667
Just an inch or so
off the ground.

27:54.750 --> 27:57.375
She can't go anywhere
unless you tow her about.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.208
Musgrove is apoplectic.

27:59.291 --> 28:02.291
I'm not supposed to tell.
(laughs)

28:02.375 --> 28:05.375
Oh, and, uh, Lavinia's opened a,
a home for them.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.458
And it's all rather
controversial,

28:07.542 --> 28:08.583
-and--
-And...

28:08.667 --> 28:10.709
she, she, she
just now got word

28:10.792 --> 28:12.333
from the widow
who runs the affair.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.917
Some Touched girl
was attacked.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.208
I mean, the girl's fine,
but Lavinia, she's aflame.

28:19.291 --> 28:20.959
"It's time society accepted

28:21.041 --> 28:22.750
that the Touched are
amongst us, and they're--"

28:22.834 --> 28:26.375
And I said, "Well,
they're not amongst us.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.667
You know, they're in
The Orphanage."

28:28.750 --> 28:30.625
And she called me a genius.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.500
Which is worse than when
she calls me an idiot,
because...

28:33.583 --> 28:36.250
I, I never know what she...

28:36.333 --> 28:38.291
She's bringing them
to the opera.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.083
Tonight!
In our box.

28:43.166 --> 28:46.125
She's ousted the Van Alders
for these wo-women.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.125
I'm to make the fourth.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.750
-Are they hideous?
-I've no idea.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.458
It's, um...

28:52.542 --> 28:54.667
It's, it's, it's the widow,
Mrs. True,

28:54.750 --> 28:56.750
I think, and her companion.

28:56.834 --> 28:58.625
Do you think
they might be hideous?

28:58.709 --> 29:01.583
Well, whatever they are,
flirt with the ugly one.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.834
It creates an unexpected
balance.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.166
I don't know how to flirt.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.083
God, these people
make me uneasy.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.959
What if she's some sort of
Elephant Man woman?

29:12.041 --> 29:14.667
Well, then, she's probably
the ugly one.

29:15.667 --> 29:17.583
You have to come.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.875
Oh! To the opera?

29:19.959 --> 29:22.291
Well, you know everything
about flirting.

29:22.375 --> 29:26.125
-Plus, you don't mind
when people are odd.
-(groans)

29:26.208 --> 29:27.625
It's how we're friends.

29:27.709 --> 29:30.125
-(shoes thunk on floor)
-But it's "Faust"!

29:30.208 --> 29:31.834
Please?

29:31.917 --> 29:35.208
I'll do anything. I mean...

29:35.291 --> 29:37.208
People are already
saying unkind things

29:37.291 --> 29:39.959
about Lavinia's passion
on the subject.

29:40.041 --> 29:42.458
-If this whole thing
doesn't go smoothly--
-Mmm-mmm.

29:42.542 --> 29:45.000
I've got a very
important meeting with
the Minister of Finance

29:45.083 --> 29:47.625
about The Ferryman's
next Midnight Carouse.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.542
The Ferryman's? I don't--

29:49.625 --> 29:51.792
Sorry, wh-what does
the Minister of Finance
have to do

29:51.875 --> 29:53.166
with your pagan sex club?

29:53.250 --> 29:55.792
Hugo:
Whatever he has to do
to get the pictures I have

29:55.875 --> 29:57.375
-from the last one.
-(coughs)

29:57.458 --> 29:58.959
That's how the club works.

29:59.041 --> 30:02.291
It's all quite delicate.
Favors and threats,
and then,

30:02.375 --> 30:07.417
one shining night
where no law yet exists.

30:07.500 --> 30:11.417
It's more than just a club.
It's an ethos.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.417
And I won't sit
through three hours
of moralistic bellowing

30:14.500 --> 30:16.000
with everyone I know and hate,

30:16.083 --> 30:18.500
just because
Lavinia's gone weird.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.291
She's not weird.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.375
I'm an ape.

30:30.583 --> 30:33.458
-But she does push you around.
-I know.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.792
I know.

30:38.417 --> 30:41.250
I will come tonight.

30:43.333 --> 30:44.959
If...

30:45.041 --> 30:47.125
Augie:
No. Me?

30:47.208 --> 30:50.000
At The Ferryman's?
No. Hugo, no. Please. I--

30:50.083 --> 30:52.125
Sex club is just...

30:52.208 --> 30:55.083
That's just flirting
on a much scarier level.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.083
You don't have to flirt.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.917
You just have to relax.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.166
Endure someone
flirting with you.

31:03.250 --> 31:05.583
These are my terms.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.834
(groans)

31:15.208 --> 31:16.792
(cawing)

31:23.291 --> 31:24.917
Oh, he's a pokey one.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.333
As far as society
is concerned,

31:27.417 --> 31:30.125
Augustus Bidlow
is above reproach,

31:30.208 --> 31:33.125
and beneath contempt.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.834
-He's perfect.
-For what?

31:37.208 --> 31:39.750
You don't have to
wear that anymore.

31:39.834 --> 31:43.500
Oh. (laughs) Right.
You are the maid.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.583
(sighs)

31:45.667 --> 31:47.333
(energy humming)

31:52.542 --> 31:53.959
I like watching you work.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.083
It's like you're conducting.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.375
Well, get in wrong
with the Beggar King,

31:59.458 --> 32:01.125
and you'll get a symphony.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.583
You shouldn't be in that life.

32:03.667 --> 32:06.083
Gift like yours,
you should be
the Royal physician,

32:06.166 --> 32:08.000
not patching up gangsters
and freaks.

32:08.083 --> 32:11.834
Gift like mine gets me branded
a voodoo witch doctor.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.917
(water dripping)

32:17.000 --> 32:19.291
I gave up being choosy.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.834
Nothing about me
not being a freak?

32:24.166 --> 32:26.208
(speaks foreign languages)

32:26.291 --> 32:27.875
Oh, no, just come in.
It's only surgery.

32:27.959 --> 32:31.166
(speaks foreign languages)

32:34.000 --> 32:35.417
Oh, right.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.291
I'm going to the opera tonight.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.500
I had a rippling.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.291
"...to accompany me
and my brother Augustus

32:42.375 --> 32:44.625
"to the opening performance
of 'Faust.'

32:44.709 --> 32:47.041
(mutters)
Lavinia Bidlow."

32:47.125 --> 32:48.542
(speaks foreign languages)

32:50.667 --> 32:52.750
So you send word that
you'd just been attacked,

32:52.834 --> 32:54.709
and she says,
"Come out to play."

32:54.792 --> 32:56.583
She even sent an outfit.

32:56.667 --> 32:58.583
And what about the part
where you rest?

32:58.667 --> 33:01.083
It's the theater,
not hard labor.

33:02.125 --> 33:03.834
And I--

33:03.917 --> 33:06.125
think I need to be there.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.625
Trouble?

33:10.458 --> 33:11.875
Hmm.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.417
Katherine will have
supper ready soon.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.208
Does Lavinia really think
I can fit into this?

33:25.291 --> 33:27.041
It's a good dress for you.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.375
(bag clasps shut)

33:29.458 --> 33:32.083
It'll keep pressure
on the wound.

33:32.166 --> 33:35.333
(footsteps departing)

33:39.250 --> 33:41.709
-Mrs. True.
-Miss Adair.

33:41.792 --> 33:43.625
You look very fine.

33:43.709 --> 33:45.625
I think so, too.

33:46.875 --> 33:49.667
(indistinct chatter)

33:52.625 --> 33:55.458
It's like something
from a storybook.

33:55.542 --> 33:58.792
(speaks foreign languages)

33:58.875 --> 34:02.291
(classical music playing)

34:05.333 --> 34:07.375
I'm not confident
in my curtsying.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.041
I'm not confident
in my breathing.

34:09.125 --> 34:10.792
Oh, I wasn't planning
to breathe.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.917
I think it's considered rude.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.750
-Does it hurt?
-Itches.

34:14.834 --> 34:17.250
Aah, that's much worse.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.333
Are you sure
we need to go to this?

34:19.417 --> 34:20.792
You have to say yes
or I'll cry, but...

34:20.875 --> 34:23.041
We need to go to this.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.166
Wish I knew why.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.542
(horse whinnies)

34:34.208 --> 34:35.834
(horse whinnies)

34:36.667 --> 34:39.500
(ominous music playing)

34:45.458 --> 34:47.417
-(carriage door closes)
-Aah...

34:47.500 --> 34:49.333
Give us the room.

34:50.542 --> 34:53.834
That's Odium.
Pardon the stench.

34:53.917 --> 34:56.959
You cannot get that man
into a bath.

34:57.041 --> 34:58.500
Declan Orrun.

34:58.583 --> 35:00.458
The Beggar King.

35:00.542 --> 35:02.291
Or, no...

35:02.375 --> 35:05.125
-Mr. Orrun, Penance Adair.
-Declan: Yeah, I know.

35:05.208 --> 35:09.083
-The great inventress.
-Oh, I'm not great.

35:09.166 --> 35:12.000
-Amalia: I assume
you've heard about--
-Do you know how it looks?

35:12.083 --> 35:14.500
Every rum on the street
hearing you calling me

35:14.583 --> 35:16.667
come like a bitch puppy?

35:16.750 --> 35:19.208
-There's channels.
-We were attacked today.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.458
Only once?

35:20.542 --> 35:24.041
They came for Myrtle Haplisch
same time we did.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.125
Probably been after
the Touched for some time,

35:26.208 --> 35:27.625
but now they've been seen.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.542
They're a danger to us,
and I'd suspect,

35:29.625 --> 35:31.542
anyone known to be
connected with us.

35:31.625 --> 35:35.458
Which you made sure
I was known
far and wide to be.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.375
You called me out,
so I'd be forced to help you.

35:38.458 --> 35:41.542
And now you've
told me that to my face.

35:41.625 --> 35:45.709
I'm genuinely searching
for a way that this spins out...

35:45.792 --> 35:48.125
that I don't kill you.

35:48.208 --> 35:51.083
It would be better
if you didn't.

35:51.166 --> 35:54.291
(laughs softly)
You're a rare fuckin' bird.

35:54.375 --> 35:56.417
You sold us the information
about Myrtle.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.500
And you're wondering
if I sold it to someone else.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.667
Well, wonder away, princess.

36:01.750 --> 36:04.000
My business is mine.

36:04.083 --> 36:07.208
Apart from the sanctity
of my harmonious marriage,

36:07.291 --> 36:10.208
fuck-all is exclusive.

36:10.291 --> 36:13.125
My girls need protection,
and I need information.

36:13.208 --> 36:17.333
Exclusive, about who's hunting
the Touched, and why.

36:17.417 --> 36:19.542
Skip the posture
and name your price.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.542
You ain't got that kind of swag.

36:21.625 --> 36:23.375
We're resourceful.

36:23.458 --> 36:27.583
Is that so?
How 'bout you get me
the Crown fucking Jewels?

36:33.375 --> 36:35.208
Wait, are you considering that?

36:35.291 --> 36:37.792
We'll start with a gift
for today's thoughtlessness.

36:37.875 --> 36:42.083
An automated motor-carriage,
designed to your specifications.

36:42.166 --> 36:45.125
And you will be paid,
if you help us.

36:47.417 --> 36:48.792
(sniffs)

36:53.041 --> 36:56.166
You're mad enough
to make this worth it.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.208
But you're mad enough
to try not to.

36:58.291 --> 37:02.667
If it goes that way,
I will cut your face
to a mess.

37:04.834 --> 37:06.834
This isn't my face.

37:12.625 --> 37:13.834
(carriage door closes)

37:13.917 --> 37:16.625
-(hooves clopping)
-(laughing)

37:16.709 --> 37:19.166
I thought you was gonna
scare them.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.583
Spread out your fingers.

37:22.667 --> 37:25.583
-Bystander: Wait.
-Hold up your hand,

37:25.667 --> 37:29.792
and spread out your
fuckin' fingers.

37:32.125 --> 37:35.125
(classical violin music)

37:40.458 --> 37:43.375
(indistinct chatter)

37:48.709 --> 37:52.375
♪

37:58.875 --> 38:01.375
(Amalia breathing shakily)

38:11.291 --> 38:12.709
(exhales)

38:12.792 --> 38:14.834
(whispers):
Hugo, get off!

38:14.917 --> 38:15.959
I have to go!

38:16.041 --> 38:18.250
I'm done after the cavern ballet
in act five,

38:18.333 --> 38:20.041
right before the prison scene.

38:21.834 --> 38:23.875
Hugo? You listening?

38:23.959 --> 38:26.000
Yes. The prison scene.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.333
-Yes.
-(both chuckle)

38:28.417 --> 38:29.792

Dr. Beldon:
Don't you agree,
Miss Bidlow?

38:34.709 --> 38:37.291
Must we fight a war
over words?

38:37.375 --> 38:39.583
I'm exhausted by these
overwrought alarums

38:39.667 --> 38:42.041
about the Frenchification
of our language.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.875
It's the end of the century.

38:43.959 --> 38:47.375
These ancient prejudices
have no use.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.250
Dr. Beldon,

38:49.333 --> 38:51.250
you adopt new terms
as they become relevant

38:51.333 --> 38:53.875
to your practice
of psychoanalysis,
I imagine.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.000
Practically every week of late.

38:56.083 --> 38:59.834
Lavinia:
Language requires not stasis,
but specificity.

38:59.917 --> 39:03.208
I should be thrilled
to excise the word "nice."

39:03.291 --> 39:05.041
It's vague as paste.
Isn't that right, Augustus?

39:05.125 --> 39:06.375
Augustus.

39:06.458 --> 39:09.041
-Sorry?
-We were discussing
it earlier.

39:09.125 --> 39:12.041
The specificity
of modern language.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.375
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.083
-It's very nice.
-(groans)

39:16.166 --> 39:18.542
(clears throat) If it's,
uh, French terminology
we're discussing,

39:18.625 --> 39:19.917
there are a few terms

39:20.000 --> 39:23.542
we Britons simply
don't have a word for.

39:23.625 --> 39:26.000
Oh, excuse me.
(chuckles)

39:26.083 --> 39:30.125
Dr. Beldon:
I suppose we all know
the sort of terms he means.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.542
What on Earth
is Swann doing here?

39:32.625 --> 39:34.709
I...

39:34.792 --> 39:36.375
No, I know.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.375
S-so impulsive...

39:38.458 --> 39:41.000
Lord Massen.
You're well, I hope.

39:41.083 --> 39:45.291
I am, Miss Bidlow. Thank you.
Dr. Beldon, hello. Swann.

39:45.375 --> 39:48.125
We were discussing the panic
a few old men are having

39:48.208 --> 39:49.667
about certain French terms.

39:49.750 --> 39:53.208
There was one debated
on the Parliament floor.
What was it?

39:53.291 --> 39:54.625
"Employees."

39:54.709 --> 39:57.959
Employees.
And here we say it,
and yet live.

39:58.041 --> 40:01.291
It is not panicking
to abhor something.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.792
Neither is it useful
to replace

40:03.875 --> 40:06.083
a perfectly good
Anglo-Saxon word

40:06.166 --> 40:07.875
with some foreigner's flourish.

40:07.959 --> 40:09.917
In England,
we say "the employed."

40:10.000 --> 40:14.125
What possible benefit
in replacing it with
"employees"?

40:14.208 --> 40:16.250
Amalia:
The singular.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.750
One may refer to
a single employee,

40:18.834 --> 40:20.166
whereas "the employed"

40:20.250 --> 40:23.000
can only be used to describe
a mass of people.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.625
It doesn't allow for the idea
that a single worker

40:25.709 --> 40:28.291
may be a whole
and meaningful being.

40:28.375 --> 40:30.125
Mrs. Amalia True.
Miss Adair.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.291
May I introduce Lord Massen?

40:32.375 --> 40:35.792
-Mrs. True runs The Orphanage.
-Indeed.

40:35.875 --> 40:37.500
(whispers):
Which one's the ugly one?

40:37.583 --> 40:39.792
Lord Massen:
I take it then that
you are yourselves

40:39.875 --> 40:41.041
among the afflicted?

40:41.125 --> 40:44.125
Touched, yes.
We don't consider
ourselves afflicted.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.166
Perhaps some women
are more fortunate

40:46.250 --> 40:48.500
in the nature
of their ailment
than others.

40:48.583 --> 40:50.208
That's true, but,

40:50.291 --> 40:52.500
more suffer from
society's perception

40:52.583 --> 40:54.125
than their own debilitation.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.709
Well, so what's wrong with you?

40:57.709 --> 41:00.417
(laughs nervously)
I, I think he means me.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.709
-Uh, where to begin--
-No, it's just, you,
you lo-- you, you look...

41:03.792 --> 41:05.500
You're qu--
You're quite nice.

41:05.583 --> 41:09.542
And you, um,
y-you have the charity,
The Orphanage.

41:09.625 --> 41:12.667
That seems... normal.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.375
Miss Bidlow runs The Orphanage.

41:14.458 --> 41:15.959
We're just the employed.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.542
Shockingly,
I'd say my brother
has spoken for everyone.

41:19.625 --> 41:22.083
They're anxious to know
what your "turns" are.

41:22.166 --> 41:25.792
-(sniffs) A "turn" is a trick.
-Amalia: It's not a trick.

41:25.875 --> 41:28.208
Penance is an inventor.
A creator, really.

41:28.291 --> 41:30.834
Oh. There's only
one Creator. (laughs)

41:30.917 --> 41:33.709
No, uh, I can see energy.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.250
Potential energy.
Like with electricity.

41:36.333 --> 41:38.500
I can see where
it wants to go, or,

41:38.583 --> 41:39.959
move, or settle.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.625
It helps me put things together.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.166
And yours?

41:44.250 --> 41:47.291
Mrs. True tends to be
a few steps ahead of
the rest of us.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.875
Mmm. A prognosticator.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.375
Nothing so grand.

41:51.458 --> 41:52.875
So I shouldn't ask
how I'm going to die.

41:52.959 --> 41:56.542
No, but one can safely assume
it will involve a French word.

41:56.625 --> 41:58.625
Ha!

41:58.709 --> 42:01.375
-You see the future?
-Snippets.

42:01.458 --> 42:03.834
It's as confusing
as it is useful.

42:03.917 --> 42:05.291

42:05.375 --> 42:08.208
You've seen men who suddenly
feel themselves back in battle.

42:08.291 --> 42:10.166
Well, sometimes I go forward.

42:10.250 --> 42:12.041
I never said I was a soldier.

42:12.125 --> 42:15.041
-You're probably going to.
-No, it's the eyes.

42:27.125 --> 42:29.667
chaos is not change.

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:16.834
the elite of society en masse,

1:08:16.917 --> 1:08:18.792
but that's what
ends up happening.

1:08:18.875 --> 1:08:19.792
(SCREAMING)

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:22.500
MANSON: She's somebody that
I want to hug all the time.

1:08:22.583 --> 1:08:25.166
You know, because people
aren't born that vindictive,

1:08:25.250 --> 1:08:26.959
or as a terrorist.

1:08:27.041 --> 1:08:29.125
They become it
because of something

1:08:29.208 --> 1:08:30.125
within their past,

1:08:30.208 --> 1:08:32.542
and that's what
resonated with me.

1:08:32.959 --> 1:08:35.333
DONNELLY: The opera scene
was my first experience

1:08:35.417 --> 1:08:39.041
of Amy playing Maladie,
and it was incredible to see

1:08:39.125 --> 1:08:41.083
what she was bringing
out of that character,

1:08:41.166 --> 1:08:44.375
and how she was able to perform,
literally, on that stage.

1:08:44.875 --> 1:08:47.583
MANSON: As an actress,
you dream of a role like this.

1:08:48.291 --> 1:08:50.834
That's no mean feat,
playing Maladie.

1:08:51.208 --> 1:08:53.625
I went back to what we used
to do at drama school,

1:08:53.709 --> 1:08:55.417
so the words come last.

1:08:56.417 --> 1:08:59.834
It's all about who she is,
and what she feels,

1:08:59.917 --> 1:09:00.834
what's her trigger,

1:09:00.917 --> 1:09:03.458
and what it feels like
to be lonely,

1:09:03.542 --> 1:09:05.583
to be this solitary existence.

1:09:06.417 --> 1:09:09.500
It's taken me down some, uh,
some random paths,

1:09:09.583 --> 1:09:11.500
the research that
I go into, actually,

1:09:11.583 --> 1:09:14.834
and some, yeah,
really squirmish places
that I get to.

1:09:15.083 --> 1:09:16.417
Why am I here?

1:09:16.792 --> 1:09:18.792
CHRISTINE BLUNDELL:
Maladie's got this constant war

1:09:18.875 --> 1:09:19.875
with herself.

1:09:20.417 --> 1:09:23.959
It's very hard when you're doing
somebody that is that damaged.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:25.875
We did so many
different looks on her.

1:09:25.959 --> 1:09:28.500
We went to the absolute extreme,
where we are just, kind of,

1:09:28.583 --> 1:09:31.709
almost doing comedy joker stuff,
and then we pulled it back.

1:09:32.125 --> 1:09:35.250
The inspiration almost come
from modern-day punk.

1:09:35.417 --> 1:09:38.041
Her hair is really messed up,
do you know what I mean?

1:09:38.125 --> 1:09:40.250
And when she puts on
her makeup, we literally go...

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:43.625
There we go. (LAUGHS)

1:09:44.792 --> 1:09:46.250
MANSON:
Every time I got in her garb,

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:48.709
there was like a flick
of a switch that just

1:09:48.792 --> 1:09:52.083
went off in my mind, uh,
each time.

1:09:53.542 --> 1:09:56.291

TOMLINSON: The opera scene was--
was a lot of fun.

1:10:15.792 --> 1:10:17.875
It's one of the first things
that we actually shot.

1:10:17.959 --> 1:10:21.583
So, to be, sort of, finding
the character, you know,

1:10:21.667 --> 1:10:24.709
straight off in-- in a scene
that's that important was--

1:10:24.792 --> 1:10:26.375
was quite intense.

1:10:28.041 --> 1:10:31.500
We had these great big, um, rigs
of blue light

1:10:31.583 --> 1:10:36.250
that, sort of, went around me
and changed as we shot it.

1:10:36.583 --> 1:10:38.709
And it's visually
kind of arresting

1:10:38.792 --> 1:10:41.000
and haunting at the same time.

JANE ESPENSON:
We used a light effect

1:10:45.792 --> 1:10:49.250
that's not really meant
to-- to symbolize an actual

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.583
visible light that everyone
in the room saw.

1:10:51.792 --> 1:10:55.291
It's sort of,
"Here's what it feels like,"

1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:59.000
and you can see who's Touched
and who's not.

1:10:59.083 --> 1:11:00.875
And certain people
are off camera

1:11:00.959 --> 1:11:03.333
and you don't know
whether there's a light on them

1:11:03.417 --> 1:11:05.542
or not, they're purposely kept
ambiguous.

1:11:05.875 --> 1:11:08.959
But we saw, for example,
that Augie is Touched,

1:11:09.041 --> 1:11:11.333
which is, uh, a-- a reveal.

1:11:12.208 --> 1:11:14.792
I don't think Augie's got
any idea that he's Touched

1:11:14.875 --> 1:11:16.166
prior to that moment.

1:11:16.375 --> 1:11:18.792
That partly comes from
the fact that he belongs

1:11:18.875 --> 1:11:21.083
to a social class
where he doesn't believe

1:11:21.166 --> 1:11:23.834
this is something that affects
people like him.

ANN SKELLY: It feels like
all your pain

1:11:25.792 --> 1:11:28.333
is just melted away and then
you're just left with this,

1:11:28.583 --> 1:11:33.375
like, very present feeling
that Penance gets to share
with Augie.

1:11:33.709 --> 1:11:35.709
I think she's the only one
who sees this

1:11:35.792 --> 1:11:37.667
and understands it
and realizes it.

1:11:38.250 --> 1:11:42.333
It hits Amalia somewhere deep
in her soul

1:11:42.417 --> 1:11:48.333
that this means something
very unique and special

1:11:48.667 --> 1:11:50.417
for The Touched. She knows that,

1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:52.834
kind of, Mary
is the way forward with this.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:55.667
MANSON: Maladie thought
that she was the chosen one,

1:11:55.750 --> 1:11:58.291
she was the special one,
but Mary's got this bigger power

1:11:58.375 --> 1:12:02.250
over more people and queries,
"Hang on a second, I thought
it was just me."

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:04.542
So that's why she chooses
to kidnap Mary,

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:06.667
and just to gain
more information.

1:12:06.750 --> 1:12:10.542
There's more going on
than what Maladie
first understood.
