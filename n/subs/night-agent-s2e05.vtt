WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:07.131
[tense music playing]

00:07.132 --> 00:08.924
[Noor] I need to get my family
out of Iran.

00:08.925 --> 00:10.426
You have to help us. Please.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.095
[Catherine] Noor Taheri.
We're taking over her case.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.681
[Peter] This is one of the photos you took
of the man that met with your ambassador.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.765
Solomon Vega.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.560
[Noor] The ambassador
was given a briefcase before he left.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.894
[Peter] Make copies of what's in there.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.313
You do that,
we will get your family out of Iran

00:23.314 --> 00:26.108
and bring them here so you can
live together. That's the offer.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.237
[Noor] I have a party tomorrow
at the ambassador's residence.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.364
[Haleh] Excuse me?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.699
What are you doing up here?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.826
Everyone's supposed
to hand in their phone.

00:35.827 --> 00:39.039
- [Rose] I found this on the banister.
- I'll make sure she gets it.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.790
[snapping fingers] You.
Come help me with something.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.668
- [electricity crackling]
- [both grunting]

00:44.669 --> 00:45.794
[man yelling]

00:45.795 --> 00:46.879
[Noor] I've betrayed my country.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.423
If those documents
are as important as you say,

00:49.424 --> 00:51.133
get my family out of Iran.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.928
Then you will have your photos,
not before.

00:55.764 --> 00:56.806
[music fades]

00:58.808 --> 01:00.810
[opening theme music playing]

01:04.647 --> 01:06.649
[door buzzing, opening]

01:07.442 --> 01:08.692
[door closing]

01:08.693 --> 01:09.777
[keys jangling]

01:09.778 --> 01:10.944
[door buzzing]

01:10.945 --> 01:12.530
[tense music playing]

01:26.711 --> 01:29.713
You are not my lawyer.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.216
- What gave me away?
- [man] Well, let's see.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.178
You're short about two inches,
70 pounds, and a penis.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.179
Who are you?

01:37.180 --> 01:40.849
Someone wondering
why a decorated Delta Force operator

01:40.850 --> 01:43.936
is behind bars, awaiting court-martial.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.729
It's spelled out in the official report.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.148
Have fun trying to find
the unredacted copy, okay?

01:48.149 --> 01:49.067
I've read it.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.527
It's a real slog.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.737
I have a few questions though.

01:53.738 --> 01:57.574
For instance, why would
the same Sergeant Sami Saidi,

01:57.575 --> 02:01.245
who was shot saving hostages
during Operation New Dawn,

02:01.246 --> 02:05.332
subsequently kill a civilian
during Operation Torchlight,

02:05.333 --> 02:06.500
try to cover it up?

02:06.501 --> 02:09.294
Both those operations were classified.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.255
They still are.

02:11.756 --> 02:16.218
I assume the official report
is missing some details.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.761
I have a theory.

02:17.762 --> 02:22.350
It was Sergeant Theo Miller
who shot Aisha Al-Bashir in Ramadi.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.017
How do you know her name?

02:24.018 --> 02:28.397
Command tried to cover it up to protect
the nephew of a four-star general.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.483
- You refused. Now you're being railroaded.
- [Sami sighing]

02:31.484 --> 02:36.030
But... not before
you put Miller in the hospital.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.283
How'd I do?

02:40.535 --> 02:45.165
[in Arabic] Your file says
you speak Arabic.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.166
Fluent?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.251
[in Arabic] My mother insisted we learn.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.544
[music fades]

02:50.545 --> 02:52.547
Wanted us to remember our roots.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.258
[in English] A wise woman.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.134
Any other languages?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.136
[in French] What is it
that you want, Madame?

02:59.137 --> 03:04.392
Yes, I speak French, Urdu, Pashto...
[in Farsi] ...passable Farsi.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.062
[in German] To be or not to be?
That is the question.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.440
[in Dutch] I can also speak Dutch to you,
I've got plenty of time anyway.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.027
[in Russian] I speak rather poor Russian...

03:14.903 --> 03:16.905
Do you have something to say?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.032
[in English] Who are you?

03:20.992 --> 03:24.119
I'm here on behalf
of the president of the United States.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.037
Right.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.080
I work for a top-secret program

03:27.081 --> 03:30.417
tasked with investigating
corruption and treason

03:30.418 --> 03:33.420
at the highest echelons
of American intelligence.

03:33.421 --> 03:37.258
I think you would be
an interesting candidate to join us.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.803
[in English] Sounds tempting,
but I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.554
My apologies.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.641
[suspenseful music playing]

03:47.852 --> 03:49.854
[handcuffs clanking]

03:51.231 --> 03:53.316
Let me tell you about Night Action.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.570
[opening theme music playing]

04:00.740 --> 04:02.991
Give Noor until the end of the day
to cool off,

04:02.992 --> 04:05.244
see if she hands over the pictures
of the documents.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.454
- What if she doesn't?
- Leverage her.

04:07.455 --> 04:11.208
Either she gives us what she promised,
or we expose her to the ambassador.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.795
You cannot be serious.
You'd just burn her like that?

04:14.796 --> 04:17.256
She's the whole reason
we know about the documents.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.091
And now she's not cooperating.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.550
Wait, you're on board with this?

04:20.551 --> 04:25.055
We don't have time for alternatives. Okay?
Foxglove is already in the wrong hands.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.974
What do you mean? What is Foxglove?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.226
[music fades]

04:30.520 --> 04:31.604
We can't tell you.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.776
But trust me, Rose, potentially thousands
of lives are at risk here. Thousands.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.989
Okay, but let's all just be human beings
for a second, okay?

04:41.614 --> 04:44.116
What if the Iranian mission
finds something that implicates Noor,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.202
and you still haven't got her family out?

04:46.911 --> 04:49.871
They'll send her back home, throw her
and her family in prison, or worse.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.832
Then let's hope they don't find anything.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.502
[scoffing] Since when have we relied
on hope?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.713
If you're gonna fuck someone over,
be honest about it.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.716
We need to move quickly.
An extraction could take weeks.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.386
Blackmail might be the only option.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.264
Well, I just met Noor.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.516
You know better than I do
how to get her on board.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.145
We can't move as fast as she wants.
Okay? We can't.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.688
And she knew what she was getting into.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.106
She knew it was gonna be dangerous

05:16.107 --> 05:18.359
when she agreed
to help us get those documents.

05:19.610 --> 05:23.155
I'll call her tonight,
present her with the options.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.241
[tense music playing]

05:31.372 --> 05:32.540
[car horns honking]

05:33.166 --> 05:37.879
[Javad in Farsi] Hamza was discharged
this morning. Ali is still concussed.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.131
The hospital will keep him another day.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.965
[keyboard clacking]

05:41.966 --> 05:43.301
[in Farsi] American?

05:44.218 --> 05:46.763
Or a flawless American accent.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.598
Where else did he go?

05:50.141 --> 05:51.267
[Javad] We don't know.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.020
There's 15 minutes of dead air
on last night's security feed.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.481
He tripped the circuit.

05:58.024 --> 06:04.071
Either he correctly guessed that
the cameras would reboot if he did.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.241
- Or--
- Or he was told by someone on our end.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.788
Couldn't happen at a worse time.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.833
I don't like rats in my house, Javad.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.921
[indistinct chatter]

06:23.216 --> 06:24.049
Noor.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.761
[in Farsi] I was wondering
if I'd get to see you today.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.763
[Noor sighing]

06:29.555 --> 06:30.764
How are Hamza and Ali?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.517
[exhaling] Still recovering.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.436
[Noor] Uh...

06:36.229 --> 06:39.356
And the man who attacked them?
Did you find him?

06:39.357 --> 06:40.608
Not yet.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.735
Soon enough.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.363
Have you been crying?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.490
No, no.

06:48.324 --> 06:52.578
I'm a little under the weather.
Maybe keep your distance.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.706
Last thing I want is to get you sick.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.710
Who else will keep us safe
from rude diplomats?

07:00.711 --> 07:02.712
And meddlesome caterers.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.298
Especially them.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.470
Only because you insisted.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.515
Feel better.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.809
Thank you.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.271
Hello.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.483
[Noor clearing throat]

07:22.984 --> 07:23.860
Noor...

07:25.403 --> 07:27.780
Are you okay?
You've been acting strange lately.

07:29.699 --> 07:33.452
Taking forever to run errands,
looking over your shoulder.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.288
I didn't realize I was being timed.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.748
Last night, that woman found your phone
by Abbas's office.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.084
Nobody was supposed to be upstairs.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.254
I heard a noise. I went to check.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.841
Spare me the lie. Something's up.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.677
You've clearly been crying.
I'm worried about you.

07:50.678 --> 07:54.931
I'm fine. Just a little sick.
Stop asking... please.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.934
[tense music playing]

08:01.189 --> 08:03.191
[siren wailing in distance]

08:04.192 --> 08:05.735
[door rattling, clicking]

08:07.028 --> 08:09.030
[keyboard clacking]

08:09.780 --> 08:10.614
[lock clicking]

08:10.615 --> 08:11.865
[Peter] Work?

08:11.866 --> 08:15.369
CEO wants to discuss my future
at the company.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.413
I'm sorry.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.707
I'm gonna grab some food.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.585
- What do you want?
- I'm good.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.297
- Have you eaten since breakfast?
- No.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
What are you, on a hunger strike?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.304
Rose, I get that you're upset.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.222
You get that I'm upset?

08:35.223 --> 08:37.724
I'm trying my best here. Okay?
What do you want me to do?

08:37.725 --> 08:38.809
Get her family out.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.270
Like she asked from the beginning
and like you agreed to do.

08:42.271 --> 08:45.690
We're working on it. Okay?
But a job like this, it takes time.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.026
Weeks of recon, multiple operatives.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.403
Her brother's military service
starts next week.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.031
Catherine's trying to get the CIA
to expedite the process.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.492
The CIA that Warren worked for? That CIA?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.786
You're asking Noor
to trust the same institutions

08:57.787 --> 08:59.788
that you investigate in Night Action?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.748
The one that drove you
off the grid for a month?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.668
- It's a little more complicated.
- It really isn't, Peter.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.503
[siren wailing in distance]

09:06.504 --> 09:08.631
What would you do if I was in her shoes?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.509
I know you wouldn't give up that easily.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.347
Fine.

09:16.847 --> 09:21.477
Okay? I'll call Catherine, and, um,
we'll try to figure something else out.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.688
- Thank you.
- [Peter] Yeah.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.148
And I was thinking burgers

09:27.149 --> 09:31.027
with fries and mayo and ketchup.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.862
Yeah, I know your order.

09:32.863 --> 09:33.822
[Rose chuckling]

09:33.823 --> 09:34.740
Thank you.

09:36.117 --> 09:40.663
Next time, try coming before
the infection sets in, Mr. Welling.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.750
I'll just avoid bar fights altogether.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.171
Someone will be in shortly
with your prescription.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.755
[Solomon] Thank you.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.173
[phone ringing]

09:52.174 --> 09:53.384
[door opening]

09:54.594 --> 09:55.427
What?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.471
I can't believe that woman
did that to you.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.598
She's a tiny little thing.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.807
I'm aware, Celeste.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.685
- How long you gonna keep this up?
- Until I find them.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.895
And until I can get you back
into the house safely.

10:05.896 --> 10:09.775
No, I mean running around the world.
Getting in all these messes.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.737
- You ever think about retiring?
- How, Celeste?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.615
You know everything I make
goes to you, right?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.951
At first. But you gotta have
a little saved after a few raises, right?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.703
I've never had a raise.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.580
You're shitting me. In six years?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.874
It doesn't feel right to ask.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.376
After everything he's done for me,
for the both of us.

10:28.377 --> 10:32.255
He demands more and more from you.
You're the one taking all the risks.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.382
You're the one
putting your face out there,

10:34.383 --> 10:35.800
the one with your nuts on the table.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.427
What is the point, Celeste?

10:37.428 --> 10:40.222
Would he be able to do
any of what he does without you?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.557
[Solomon breathing deeply]

10:42.558 --> 10:44.351
Then make damn sure he knows that.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.103
[tense music playing]

10:47.897 --> 10:49.899
[footsteps approaching]

10:50.733 --> 10:52.652
Peter Sutherland, Sami Saidi.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.571
Sami has been with Night Action
going on five years.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.239
- [Peter] It's good to meet you.
- Likewise.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.075
[Catherine] This op is Sami's decision.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.995
If he's not on board, we move forward
with what we discussed. Understood?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.413
- Yeah.
- Take it away.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.625
We have an asset that works
for the Iranian mission to the UN.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.627
We promised
we'd get her family out of Iran

11:10.628 --> 11:12.212
in exchange for leaked intelligence

11:12.213 --> 11:14.756
that the Iranian ambassador
was in possession of.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.175
Now, I need someone to extract her family

11:17.176 --> 11:19.845
from the outskirts of Isfahan
by this time tomorrow.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.681
- Tomorrow? Wow.
- [Peter] Yeah.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.266
This intel, how...
how big a deal are we talking?

11:25.267 --> 11:29.562
We think it has something to do with a
chemical weapons program called Foxglove.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.065
Hmm. I thought the world agreed
not to test those anymore.

11:32.066 --> 11:36.194
A few generals wanted to protect against
a new generation of chemical warfare,

11:36.195 --> 11:39.656
so they hired elite scientists
to brainstorm weapons

11:39.657 --> 11:42.492
that could be produced
with modern tech and modern chemistry,

11:42.493 --> 11:45.829
then... went on ahead and created it.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.040
And the mobile lab
they created it in just got stolen.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.792
- [Sami] By the Iranians?
- It's unclear.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.254
But we're hoping the documents can shed
some light on who stole it and why.

11:54.255 --> 11:58.091
- Still... 24 hours.
- Yeah, I know.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.219
Our asset has risked a lot
to get us this intel.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.140
And, not to mention, her brother
starts military conscription next week,

12:04.724 --> 12:07.100
at which point extraction
would be impossible.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.518
[Peter breathing deeply]

12:08.519 --> 12:11.604
Now, look, I... I get this is a huge ask.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.356
Yeah, I get it. What's plan B?

12:13.357 --> 12:16.776
You know, threaten to expose her
to her bosses,

12:16.777 --> 12:18.903
blackmail her
to hand over the intelligence.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.991
But at least that buys you a few more days
to plan for the extraction.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.325
A few days? Sounds great.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.996
And this is assuming the Iranian mission
doesn't discover her by then.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.540
[Catherine] Hey, look,
I don't love either option,

12:30.541 --> 12:34.920
but at least my way, Sami's
not going into the field without any prep.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.840
I'm not gonna lose another agent again.
I'm just not.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.176
So her family stays together,

12:41.177 --> 12:44.012
you get what you need to find
the people that have a chemical lab,

12:44.013 --> 12:46.431
maybe prevent
some kind of attack here at home?

12:46.432 --> 12:51.352
- That's the idea, if you can pull it off.
- Any hesitation, we'll find another way.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.564
One that doesn't involve
hanging her out to dry?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.525
- Guess we gotta do it his way, then.
- Thank you.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.986
[Catherine] Okay, I'll leave you two
to talk contingencies.

12:59.987 --> 13:05.408
I'll find someone who can fly you
into Isfahan undetected this afternoon.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.577
Yeah, great.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.703
[Peter] Noor, this is Sami.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.997
He's agreed to help
get your family out of Iran.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.166
Hello. It's very nice to meet you.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.293
[in Farsi] Hello, Noor, nice to meet you.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.836
[in Farsi] You speak Farsi too!

13:16.837 --> 13:17.838
[Sami] Of course!

13:18.422 --> 13:19.339
[Noor exhaling]

13:19.340 --> 13:21.633
Now if this is gonna work,
we need to know everything.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.968
All the roads
that lead to your family's home,

13:23.969 --> 13:26.763
all the side streets,
nosy neighbors, all of it.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.264
Okay, let's get to work.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.474
[suspenseful music playing]

13:29.475 --> 13:30.725
[Artoun] <i>Rose!</i>

13:30.726 --> 13:31.851
[Rose] Hey, Artoun.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.311
[Artoun] <i>Interesting place.</i>

13:33.312 --> 13:36.648
Uh, my mom's still setting up
her new apartment.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.149
<i>Oh, so you found her. Good.</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:41.361
Uh, yeah. That's why I am not back yet.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.987
I meant to tell you. Sorry.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.741
<i>So the team and I have been discussing
the changes you made to the source code,</i>

13:46.742 --> 13:49.912
<i>and while you obviously
should have checked in with me first,</i>

13:50.412 --> 13:51.329
<i>we love it.</i>

13:51.330 --> 13:53.039
- [music fades]
- You do?

13:53.040 --> 13:55.917
<i>AdVerse as a tracking tool.</i>

13:55.918 --> 13:58.127
<i>I mean, I'm pissed
I didn't think of it myself first.</i>

13:58.128 --> 14:00.839
<i>We are talking about a company-wide pivot.</i>

14:00.840 --> 14:02.841
Uh, what about the marketing play?

14:02.842 --> 14:03.926
<i>Gone. Dead.</i>

14:04.426 --> 14:07.136
<i>I showed Adrien Mullen
what you changed, how it works.</i>

14:07.137 --> 14:08.680
<i>He wants to fully fund us,</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:11.015
<i>pitch us to government agencies,
law enforcement.</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:13.978
<i>And not just in the U.S.,
we are going global, baby!</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:16.479
Um, is that a good idea?

14:16.480 --> 14:19.149
I mean, this is a powerful tool.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.151
We need time to test the program,

14:22.152 --> 14:24.904
uh, assemble some sort of ethics board.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.281
<i>Ethics board?</i>

14:26.282 --> 14:28.992
<i>You sound like the girl in the dorm
who calls campus police</i>

14:28.993 --> 14:31.245
<i>to shut down the party
'cause she can't sleep.</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:35.164
We need to vet who we're selling to,
how they plan to use it.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.625
In the wrong hands,
this tech can be abused.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.919
<i>Rose, you really wanna
slow this train down?</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:42.464
<i>AdVerse takes off, we all win.
You get that?</i>

14:43.048 --> 14:45.843
I can't be a part of this
unless it's done right,

14:46.719 --> 14:49.388
so maybe it's best if we part ways.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.180
<i>Seriously?</i>

14:51.181 --> 14:54.267
Of course, there's still a lot of work
that needs to be done to make the pivot,

14:54.268 --> 14:56.770
and no one knows
the ins and outs of the code like me.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.440
And, look, I really doubt
that Adrien would question

15:00.441 --> 15:03.569
why your lead programmer walked out
right before a funding round.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.070
And even if he did,

15:06.071 --> 15:08.824
I'm positive he wouldn't
tank the deal as a result.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.452
[sighing] <i>What do you want, Rose?</i>

15:12.036 --> 15:15.622
Chief technology officer,
equity, and finally--

15:15.623 --> 15:18.334
<i>- Don't say ethics board.</i>
- Ethics board.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.461
[Artoun sighing]

15:23.923 --> 15:24.756
[man] He's late.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.718
The bridge is backed up.
Just give him a few extra minutes.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.969
So how was the doctor this morning?

15:29.970 --> 15:34.140
Got stitched up right this time.
Antibiotics, no permanent damage.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.059
Good.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.271
And your sister?
She liking the new apartment?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.525
She misses home... but she likes it enough.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.444
Yeah.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.405
She mentioned
something interesting earlier.

15:49.698 --> 15:53.242
Well, she just asked
how long I had been working for you,

15:53.243 --> 15:54.744
and I told her six years.

15:54.745 --> 15:58.457
And then she asked when the last time was
I got a raise, and, uh...

15:59.833 --> 16:01.460
I told her I couldn't remember.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.920
I don't think
you've ever asked for one, Solomon.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.254
[Solomon] Yeah, I guess not.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.343
You know, maybe when the time is right,
we can talk about one.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.095
- Are you unhappy?
- No.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.471
Of course not.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.100
It's just that Celeste
asked about retirement,

16:17.101 --> 16:19.395
whether I had been saving, and I haven't.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.107
And with this injury,
it got me thinking maybe I should start.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.151
And for that, I'm gonna need a raise.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.654
All right.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.532
State your case.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.077
Well, I've been with you for a while.
Six years, like I said.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.329
I think you would agree
that during that time,

16:38.330 --> 16:40.373
I've been valuable to your work.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.332
Certainly.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.585
Took on a leadership role
since Carter left.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.045
Public-facing, much higher risk.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.132
And I'm happy to do it.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.927
I just think that my compensation
should reflect that.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.139
How much were you thinking?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.850
I mean, I think ten percent.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.186
Five, maybe?

17:02.229 --> 17:03.938
I know we've had some setbacks recently,

17:03.939 --> 17:06.150
so I would understand
if you can't do five.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.651
[Solomon breathing deeply, exhaling]

17:08.652 --> 17:10.278
You know, three is a fair number.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.530
Even... even two. I think two would be...

17:12.531 --> 17:15.576
Are you negotiating a raise or a pay cut?

17:16.994 --> 17:17.995
Uh...

17:18.495 --> 17:19.455
That him?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.332
[tense music playing]

17:23.042 --> 17:23.875
Yeah.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.712
- Let's, uh, pick this up later.
- Of course.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.219
[man 2] <i>It's been a month now.</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:37.513
His name hasn't shown up
on any intelligence reports,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.933
no ops in Thailand
matching your description.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.060
As far as the bureau's concerned,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.353
Sutherland hasn't worked for us,
the U.S. government,

17:44.354 --> 17:46.105
or anyone else for the last ten months.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.358
[Solomon] <i>Then who is he working for?
He's gotta be with some government agency.</i>

17:49.359 --> 17:51.819
[man 2] <i>Not officially, he isn't.
I... I can keep digging.</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:52.738
No.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.156
Just lay low.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.035
A thousand pages on Camp David,
no black marker.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.119
Any mention of him here?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.914
You want a book report?
That'll cost extra.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.210
None of the bits I skimmed.
You sure he was there?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.212
We've heard it from a couple of sources.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.214
We're good.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.257
Pleasure doing business.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.719
[music fades]

18:16.720 --> 18:20.723
[in Farsi] Pack your bags tonight.
We'll have to move fast tomorrow.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.683
[woman in Farsi]
<i>You're sure it will be safe?</i>

18:22.684 --> 18:24.268
[Noor in Farsi] Yes, Mom, I promise.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.189
Tell Farhad not to overpack.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.731
I love you.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.149
[woman] <i>I love you.</i>

18:30.150 --> 18:31.776
<i>My brave girl.</i>

18:31.777 --> 18:33.569
- [cell phone chiming]
- That was Catherine.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.405
The pilot says he can buy you an hour
at a private airstrip.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.325
But Catherine's
still trying to find you a car.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.535
How's your mom feel?

18:40.536 --> 18:44.039
[in English] She's trying to sound strong,
but I can tell she's scared.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.834
I want to be there tomorrow with you

18:47.835 --> 18:50.379
to make sure that Sami
has them safely on the plane.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.296
Just to make sure they're okay.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.799
I'll call Peter
as soon as we're in the air with them.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.093
And I promise
I'll call you right after, okay?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.137
No. I would like to be there.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.055
It's better for you if I am.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.432
The sooner I know they're okay,
the sooner you have your documents.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.351
Fine, yeah.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.227
[Sami breathing deeply]

19:06.228 --> 19:07.353
- Thank you.
- [Peter] Yeah.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.272
Both of you.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.362
How you feel, man?
Are you good? Everything okay?

19:16.363 --> 19:17.281
Yeah.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.117
Not the most dangerous thing
Night Action has ever asked from me.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.244
When this is all over,
I'll buy you a beer,

19:23.245 --> 19:25.288
or... five.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.041
Why do I get the feeling
you're more on edge about this than I am?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.628
Catherine can't lose another agent?
What happened?

19:32.963 --> 19:35.215
We were in Bangkok,
my partner and I split up.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.968
Okay? We were made, and, uh...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.678
- [somber music playing]
- [Peter exhaling]

19:40.679 --> 19:42.723
I couldn't get back to her in time.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.934
Maybe if I would've taken
a different route,

19:46.518 --> 19:48.728
you know, run faster, I... I don't know.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.063
Stop.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.773
Don't do this, man.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.776
Don't play the "what if" game, I mean it.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.155
It's impossible to know
the best way forward.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.742
Let me tell you something.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.286
One of my Delta COs

20:06.079 --> 20:08.624
talked about having a moral anchor for me.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.044
It's my little sister.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.297
When I start playing this game,

20:16.757 --> 20:17.674
I think about her.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.095
You know?
What would she say about what I did?

20:23.096 --> 20:26.182
Would she agree
I tried to do the right thing?

20:26.183 --> 20:27.266
And if she would,

20:27.267 --> 20:30.187
I'm not saying
I sleep easy at night, but it helps.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.691
Maybe you should think about
who this person is for you.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.486
Okay.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.320
- [hands clasping]
- Get home safe.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.239
I'll try.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.329
Ugh, finally.

20:47.829 --> 20:51.250
- This shirt was starting to smell spicy.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.668
How'd the, uh, call go with your boss?

20:53.669 --> 20:57.630
Well, I threatened to quit,
and I got a promotion instead.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.967
Wow, not bad for somebody
who's been blowing off work for a week.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.469
What about you? How'd it go?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.347
Good. Um, there's an agent en route,

21:06.348 --> 21:10.977
and Noor's gonna be with Catherine and me
tomorrow while he picks up her family.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.520
Maybe you should be there too.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.689
Noor seems to be more relaxed around you.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.065
Okay. How is she?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.150
Grateful,

21:18.110 --> 21:18.986
afraid.

21:20.070 --> 21:20.904
[Rose] And you?

21:22.030 --> 21:23.156
Hopeful.

21:23.740 --> 21:27.076
But since when
have we relied on hope, right?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.911
Sometimes that's all we have.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.956
[train rattling]

21:31.915 --> 21:33.709
- What?
- Nothing.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.961
Just glad you're here.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.965
[tender music playing]

21:41.842 --> 21:43.844
[car horns honking]

21:44.636 --> 21:46.638
[indistinct chatter]

21:50.684 --> 21:52.144
- [in Farsi] Hello.
- [in Farsi] Hello.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.565
Feeling better?

21:57.065 --> 21:59.443
[in Farsi] Afraid not.
I'm heading to the doctor in a moment.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.698
What's this?

22:05.282 --> 22:06.241
<i>Aash Shalgham.</i>

22:08.994 --> 22:12.539
Mom would make it for us
whenever we were sick.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.040
[Noor exhaling]

22:14.041 --> 22:15.583
I didn't take you for a cook.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.543
[Javad chuckling]

22:17.127 --> 22:18.754
I'm not.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.299
She was watching on the phone
the entire time, criticizing.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.385
As a good Iranian mother should.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.139
Thank you. I'm sure it's delicious.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.599
Enjoy.

22:35.145 --> 22:35.979
Haleh,

22:36.688 --> 22:39.858
can I borrow you? Just for a moment.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.233
Of course.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.320
[suspenseful music playing]

22:54.039 --> 22:55.165
Take a seat.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.880
[music fades]

23:05.342 --> 23:08.637
I wanted to ask you about the party.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.682
The vendors.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.768
You chose them?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.604
They were the same as last year.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.647
All of them?

23:19.648 --> 23:23.235
[Haleh] The decorators, the florists,

23:23.819 --> 23:25.778
the valets--

23:25.779 --> 23:26.987
The caterers?

23:26.988 --> 23:30.032
No, this was our first time using them.

23:30.033 --> 23:33.036
The last company went out of business.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.664
And how did you pick new ones?

23:36.665 --> 23:39.835
Bijan and I tasted a few places.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.297
Is this about the man
who attacked Hamza and Ali?

23:55.642 --> 23:57.477
[Javad] Do you remember seeing this man?

23:58.186 --> 23:59.020
That him?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.272
No.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.191
[tense music playing]

24:03.817 --> 24:06.445
Said with such confidence.

24:07.279 --> 24:12.658
I mean, it's possible
I passed him during the party.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.785
I don't know.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.537
Which is it?

24:16.830 --> 24:19.499
You didn't see him, or you don't know?

24:20.625 --> 24:21.877
I... I don't know.

24:22.377 --> 24:27.423
Oh. You finalized the guest list, right?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.633
Did you make any last-minute changes?

24:29.634 --> 24:33.429
People were canceling or revising
until the day before.

24:33.430 --> 24:38.517
And... who approves the final list?

24:38.518 --> 24:40.728
Abbas, but he never changes it.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.774
So really, <i>you</i> give final approval.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.611
What is this about exactly, Javad?

24:57.037 --> 24:58.622
[Javad] Do you remember seeing her?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.458
She looks familiar.

25:08.757 --> 25:09.883
[keyboard clacking]

25:12.719 --> 25:14.554
That's right. I did speak to her...

25:16.431 --> 25:18.641
Near the Ambassador's personal office?

25:18.642 --> 25:21.393
I heard a noise upstairs. I went to check.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.395
I saw this woman looking for a bathroom.

25:23.396 --> 25:27.734
And... the phone? Hers or yours?

25:30.320 --> 25:31.153
Haleh--

25:31.154 --> 25:32.197
Mine.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.241
It fell out of my pocket.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.576
She saw it and was giving it back to me.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.619
Great!

25:38.620 --> 25:42.707
You wouldn't mind if I take a look at it.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.544
Huh?

25:54.219 --> 25:55.971
See, Haleh,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.139
we have a problem.

26:00.850 --> 26:05.897
Because this phone looks nothing
like the one she's handing over to you.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.567
You don't find that strange?

26:09.859 --> 26:12.319
You seem to be at the center

26:12.320 --> 26:17.117
of a lot of unusual events that night.

26:20.078 --> 26:24.164
Perhaps Bijan will be more cooperative.

26:24.165 --> 26:27.084
No, Bijan has nothing to do with this.
Please...

26:27.085 --> 26:28.587
Nothing to do with what?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.382
Tell me, Haleh.

26:33.883 --> 26:34.968
Noor has it.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.094
It was her phone.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.762
[suspenseful music swelling]

26:38.763 --> 26:39.764
[Haleh crying]

26:53.069 --> 26:53.902
[music fades]

26:53.903 --> 26:54.821
Anything?

26:55.989 --> 26:57.115
[Solomon] Nothing yet.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.783
Still got a couple of sections left.

26:59.784 --> 27:03.288
If we haven't come across his name yet,
I doubt we will.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.540
They erased him from the narrative.

27:07.083 --> 27:07.917
But who?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.378
FBI? CIA? NSA?

27:11.379 --> 27:13.839
None of our contacts
can seem to place him.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.426
Whatever agency he's working for,
they wanna keep his activities quiet.

27:17.427 --> 27:18.844
[man] Perhaps.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.305
Or it's because
he's working for an agency,

27:21.306 --> 27:26.185
or a department,
or something that doesn't exist.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.063
At least not on paper.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.693
You heard the girl
over the radio in Bangkok.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.111
Night Action.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.531
[scoffing] I thought
that was just a call sign.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.785
You think it's something else?

27:42.452 --> 27:43.411
[man] I don't know.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.872
But it's a blind spot.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.959
And we cannot afford to have those,

27:50.585 --> 27:52.712
especially this close to the finish line.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.507
I've been thinking about
our earlier conversation.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.217
[tense music playing]

27:58.218 --> 27:59.302
About your salary.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.763
Yeah, we don't...
we don't have to talk about that.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.223
These past few months...

28:04.224 --> 28:08.103
helping me with Foxglove
and my plans for the future...

28:08.687 --> 28:11.272
You're right. You are invaluable to me.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.025
To this operation.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.153
And it's time that I recognize it.

28:19.239 --> 28:22.117
A 15% raise, and a title.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.952
Let's call it...

28:25.412 --> 28:27.455
Vice President of Acquisitions.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.458
Thank you very much.

28:31.459 --> 28:35.839
Your first assignment,
acquire Peter Sutherland for me.

28:37.006 --> 28:40.093
I think it's time he and I
had a proper introduction.

28:41.469 --> 28:42.387
You got it, boss.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.889
[suspenseful music playing]

28:51.730 --> 28:52.647
[lock clicking]

29:12.167 --> 29:13.042
[switch clicking]

29:43.448 --> 29:45.700
[drawer sliding open, closed]

29:47.160 --> 29:50.121
[drawer sliding open, closed]

29:57.045 --> 29:58.505
[cell phone ringing]

30:03.760 --> 30:04.719
[ringing stops]

30:06.137 --> 30:07.054
[in Farsi] Yes, sir?

30:07.055 --> 30:08.348
[Abbas in Farsi] <i>Hi, Javad.</i>

30:08.848 --> 30:11.433
I heard you interrogated Haleh and Bijan.
What's going on?

30:11.434 --> 30:12.977
No, no, it's nothing.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.815
Just had a few questions about the party,

30:17.690 --> 30:19.484
confirming details.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.069
Oh, thank God...

30:21.903 --> 30:24.029
No rat then?

30:24.030 --> 30:25.113
[Javad] Not yet.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.282
Still following up on a few leads.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.576
<i>I'll let you know as soon as I know more.</i>

30:29.577 --> 30:30.662
Very good.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.579
Please do.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.624
Thank you. Goodbye.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.213
[cell phone tapping]

[suspenseful music swelling]

31:18.835 --> 31:20.003
[car horn honking]

31:28.511 --> 31:29.345
This is it?

31:30.221 --> 31:31.431
Yeah, this is it.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.523
[knocking on door]

31:41.983 --> 31:42.859
Welcome.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.528
Make yourselves at home.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.907
[music fades]

31:49.949 --> 31:52.492
- He land yet?
- Touched down a few minutes ago.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.620
He's about 20 minutes out
from the apartment,

31:54.621 --> 31:56.414
but there's no issues so far.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.083
Can we see his location?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.878
- No.
- How do we get updates?

32:03.588 --> 32:04.880
- Cutting edge.
- [Noor sighing]

32:04.881 --> 32:06.089
When this is all over,

32:06.090 --> 32:08.175
you should talk to Travers
about upping your budget.

32:08.176 --> 32:12.429
We have a dozen of these
in every major city around the world,

32:12.430 --> 32:14.807
so, believe it or not,
it adds up pretty fast.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.309
Still.

32:16.809 --> 32:19.103
You didn't strike me
as religious, Catherine.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.231
No. I'm not.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.233
So, what now?

32:25.443 --> 32:26.945
We wait for the phone to ring.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.864
[suspenseful music playing]

32:31.824 --> 32:33.200
Just like old times, right?

32:33.201 --> 32:34.118
[Catherine] Hmm.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.918
[crickets chirping]

32:55.723 --> 32:56.807
[music fades]

32:56.808 --> 32:59.101
[in Farsi] <i>You'll forget all about me...</i>

32:59.102 --> 33:00.102
<i>I know you will...</i>

33:00.103 --> 33:01.979
[in Farsi] I'll visit all the time.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.316
<i>My brother barely came back after he left.</i>

33:05.942 --> 33:09.529
<i>They only gave him a few nights off
here and there.</i>

33:10.029 --> 33:10.863
Then,

33:12.490 --> 33:13.408
you come to me.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.659
The base is only two hours away.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.454
Mehran says there's a park
close by with a lake.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.748
<i>I just got my license.</i>

33:21.749 --> 33:24.835
<i>You're crazy if you think
Baba will allow me to disappear</i>

33:24.836 --> 33:26.838
<i>with his car all day.</i>

33:27.380 --> 33:30.924
We'll talk every day then, <i>Jujeh</i>.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.012
<i>You'll call me every day, promise?</i>

33:34.595 --> 33:36.681
- I promise, I promise.
- [knocking on door]

33:38.224 --> 33:39.475
[dog barking in distance]

33:40.518 --> 33:42.019
Someone's at the front door.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.145
<i>Now?</i>

33:43.146 --> 33:44.063
[Farhad] Let me...

33:44.647 --> 33:45.773
I'll call you back.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.487
- [woman in Farsi] Hello.
- [Sami in Farsi] Hello.

33:52.488 --> 33:53.947
[woman] The bags are there.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.158
Hello, Farhad.

33:55.658 --> 33:58.036
- Hello.
- [Sami] We need to leave now.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.245
Who is he?

34:00.246 --> 34:01.581
Don't worry, trust me.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.541
Mom... What's happening?
Where are you going? Who is this?

34:04.542 --> 34:07.252
This is Sami.
He's here to take us to your sister.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.464
- [Farhad] What?
- You didn't tell him...?

34:10.173 --> 34:14.426
Your sister figured out a way
to get us out of Iran.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.928
Just like Baba talked about.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.264
- Are you serious?
- Why didn't you tell him?

34:19.265 --> 34:21.600
I've already packed our bags.
But we need to go now.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.894
Is this a joke?

34:24.020 --> 34:25.270
Who are you really?

34:25.271 --> 34:27.189
Farhad, keep your voice down.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.274
This is my house!

34:28.775 --> 34:31.485
- Don't tell me what to do!
- Farhad, quiet--

34:31.486 --> 34:32.861
Who is this? Who are you?

34:32.862 --> 34:34.113
My name is Sami.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.534
Noor sent me here
to get you and your mother out of Iran.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.995
Noor sent you?

34:41.788 --> 34:43.455
[indistinct chatter]

34:43.456 --> 34:44.873
[objects clattering outside]

34:44.874 --> 34:45.917
You're an American?

34:46.709 --> 34:47.918
I'll explain in the car.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.712
[suspenseful music playing]

34:50.838 --> 34:52.005
We need to move.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.216
Farhad-- Listen to him, Farhad.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.635
No. I'm not going anywhere...

34:56.427 --> 34:57.345
Farhad.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.269
[phone ringing]

35:10.525 --> 35:11.858
Hey, Sami, everything okay?

35:11.859 --> 35:14.278
[in English] We have a problem.
The brother doesn't wanna come.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.448
Put him on the phone.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.076
You need to figure this out
with your brother, okay?

35:20.952 --> 35:21.993
This is ridiculous.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.287
We have no idea who this man is
or what he wants with us.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.831
I told you, Noor sent him.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.333
- No!
- Your sister--

35:31.754 --> 35:34.048
- Noor?
- [in Farsi] Farhad, you need to listen.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.550
You need to go with them. Now.

35:36.551 --> 35:37.968
First, tell me what's going on!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.680
I found a way for us to leave Iran.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.306
Forever. To have a better life.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.934
I don't want to leave home!

35:45.518 --> 35:47.603
I would've told you
if you'd bothered to ask.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.729
Mom said she told you.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.482
I was afraid he'd run off...

35:52.400 --> 35:53.650
You knew he'd say no?

35:53.651 --> 35:55.069
Hey, what's happening?

35:56.445 --> 35:59.073
[in English] My mother didn't tell him
they were leaving.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.118
[in Farsi] I thought he'd understand
and listen to me.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.411
[in Farsi] Mom!

36:04.412 --> 36:07.122
Farhad, I am your older sister.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.792
- So?
- I know what's best for all of us.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.128
I did this for you.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.504
You don't have to go to the army anymore.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.756
That's why you did this?

36:16.257 --> 36:18.759
Please, Farhad... listen to her.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.803
I have friends here.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.472
People who care about me, who love me!

36:24.473 --> 36:26.141
<i>We</i> love you!

36:26.142 --> 36:28.018
- Just go without me.
- That won't work.

36:28.019 --> 36:28.935
[Farhad] Why not?

36:28.936 --> 36:30.229
[knocking on door]

36:30.730 --> 36:31.606
[man in Farsi] Azita?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.356
Brother Farhad?

36:33.357 --> 36:34.692
It's Babak.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.069
[Babak] Farhad?

36:38.529 --> 36:40.031
- Brother Farhad?
- [knocking continues]

36:41.199 --> 36:42.991
- Hello.
- Hello, Babak.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.159
Everything okay?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.410
Everything's fine...

36:45.411 --> 36:46.703
There's a stranger here--

36:46.704 --> 36:47.914
Who's here?

36:49.123 --> 36:50.124
Farhad.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.168
This is my nephew---

36:52.877 --> 36:53.710
She's lying--

36:53.711 --> 36:54.711
- Hello.
- Farhad.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.630
[Babak] Hi.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.883
He's a bit angry.
Just a small family dispute--

36:59.884 --> 37:02.886
- He's a stranger. He shouldn't be here!
- [Azita] Farhad, silence!

37:02.887 --> 37:05.263
- Who is that?
- That's Babak, our neighbor.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.641
Maybe the two of us should speak outside.

37:07.642 --> 37:08.643
That's not necessary.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.144
That accent?

37:10.728 --> 37:11.603
Where are you from?

37:11.604 --> 37:13.021
I'm visiting from abroad.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.481
Help us! Get him out!

37:14.482 --> 37:16.775
Farhad, enough!

37:16.776 --> 37:18.360
Babak, really, we're fine.

37:18.361 --> 37:21.154
It's a family matter.
Don't interfere, please.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.740
Not until I understand what's going on.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.618
Come inside then. We'll talk.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.663
[indistinct chatter]

37:29.830 --> 37:30.665
Come in then.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.251
We'll talk.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.210
[Babak] Talk, huh?

37:35.211 --> 37:37.296
[suspenseful music swelling]

37:40.508 --> 37:43.636
You need to tell me
exactly what they just said, right now.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.432
Catherine, call this off now.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.601
- Get Sami out of there.
- No, not without them.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.144
Your brother is not cooperating.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.605
If you don't get them out,
I will destroy these photos.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.482
I don't care what happens to me.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.068
Does your brother speak English?

38:00.027 --> 38:00.944
A little bit.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.612
What the hell are you doing?

38:02.613 --> 38:04.781
[Peter] <i>Hey, Farhad. Can you hear me?</i>

38:04.782 --> 38:06.783
[Farhad in English] <i>Hello?
Yes. Who are you?</i>

38:06.784 --> 38:08.994
[Peter] My name's Peter. I work with Noor.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.747
Listen, your life is changing
very quickly. Okay?

38:12.748 --> 38:15.125
I can't imagine
how difficult this is for you.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.751
But you need to listen to me.

38:16.752 --> 38:20.005
Your sister is in trouble with the IRGC.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.590
- What trouble?
- <i>They're planning on hurting people.</i>

38:22.591 --> 38:24.509
Okay? Now your sister's been very brave,

38:24.510 --> 38:26.428
and she's helping us to try to stop them.

38:26.429 --> 38:29.431
But now they're suspicious of her.
She's in danger.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.890
<i>Your sister needs your help.</i>

38:30.891 --> 38:32.142
I... I don't understand.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.102
Fuck!

38:34.103 --> 38:35.438
[in Farsi] The Pasdar.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.398
They suspect me of helping the Americans.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.401
Does he understand? Do you understand?

38:40.985 --> 38:42.778
[in English] Yes, I... I understand.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.865
- Make Noor safe.
- [Peter] That's what I'm trying to do.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.616
And the quicker you leave with Sami,

38:48.617 --> 38:52.537
the less chance the IRGC has
of finding out that this happened.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.498
Okay? The easier it'll be for us
to keep your sister safe.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.959
<i>- You love her, right?</i>
- Yes, of course.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.879
Help us by keeping her safe.

39:00.880 --> 39:04.216
[in Farsi] Farhad. Farhad, please...

39:05.885 --> 39:08.011
[in Farsi] Okay, let's go.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.013
[in English] Okay.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.472
[in English] I'll go.

[Noor exclaiming]

39:18.481 --> 39:20.690
- The bags--
- Leave them, we have to go!

39:20.691 --> 39:21.734
[Babak] Hey, dude,

39:22.360 --> 39:23.277
come out!

39:23.861 --> 39:26.237
[Sami] You don't want to do this...

39:26.238 --> 39:28.239
Get out of their home.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.366
I've already explained--

39:29.367 --> 39:31.202
Come out here and explain it again.

39:32.828 --> 39:33.704
No?

39:34.830 --> 39:36.748
Call the police, tell them a stranger
has come--

39:36.749 --> 39:38.209
Oh, God...

Get in the car. Get in the car.

39:47.551 --> 39:48.718
[people clamoring]

39:48.719 --> 39:51.930
- Stay back, stay back.
- Farhad, don't go with this bastard!

39:51.931 --> 39:53.932
- [Azita] Let's go!
- Farhad, say something!

39:53.933 --> 39:55.975
- Stay back!
- Where are you going with this bastard?

39:55.976 --> 39:57.936
How are you going to escape?

39:57.937 --> 39:59.062
Foreigner!

39:59.063 --> 40:02.065
There's one hundred million of us
and only one of you.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.653
I'll hurt you so badly that even the birds
up in the sky are gonna mourn for you.

41:23.189 --> 41:24.440
Drop me off here.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.065
[Azita] Farhad--

41:26.066 --> 41:28.193
[Farhad] Take Mom to Noor.
I'm staying behind.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.112
If you stay,
they will throw you in prison.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.822
I'll figure something out.

[Azita muttering]

41:34.658 --> 41:36.242
I'll make something up--

Farhad, just think for two seconds--

41:37.745 --> 41:39.579
I'll make something up.
Stop! Let me off here.
