[tense music playing]

00:07.215 --> 00:11.343
The secretary general
of the United Nations has a case file.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.928
You bring me that file,

00:12.929 --> 00:16.640
and I'll give you the location of where
the Foxglove weapon is being assembled,

00:16.641 --> 00:19.685
and where Ms. Larkin
is currently being held captive.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.062
[men grunting]

00:21.938 --> 00:23.105
[guard grunting]

00:23.106 --> 00:24.607
[Solomon] Get in the trunk.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.860
- [Catherine grunting]
- [gun firing]

00:27.861 --> 00:29.945
- [Solomon grunting]
- [high-pitched ringing]

00:29.946 --> 00:31.905
[Peter] This is an ICC criminal case file.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.742
- About who?
- His name is Viktor Bala.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.910
He's a war criminal
being held at The Hague.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.495
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

00:38.496 --> 00:41.290
No, it just cost me my face and my prints.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.375
Ah. It'll be wiped clean by the morning.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.128
Your secret's safe with me,
on one condition.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.547
When I call, you answer.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.466
- What happened here?
- They have it.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.302
- [Catherine] K.X.?
- [Rose] Markus and his men left hours ago.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.179
They took a whole batch of canisters
with them.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.680
- Where are they?
- The UN.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.016
[Viktor] <i>The Western world
thinks us savages,</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:01.518
and yet they peddle
the very instrument of that savagery.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.103
<i>It's time, Markus.</i>

01:03.104 --> 01:06.440
[Rose] What would happen if these
canisters were distributed into an HVAC?

01:06.441 --> 01:09.860
[Wilfred] People would suffocate
in the streets. Horrific mass casualty.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.988
We are weaponizing
a massive terror attack.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.282
[music fades]

01:16.117 --> 01:18.119
[opening theme music playing]

01:23.416 --> 01:27.294
[woman] All this to say,
we couldn't shape future generations

01:27.295 --> 01:31.965
without the support
of incredible alums like Tony.

01:31.966 --> 01:35.135
- So a toast, Anthony Ming.
- [music fades]

01:35.136 --> 01:37.096
[all] Cheers!

01:37.097 --> 01:42.227
And now, presenting the Anthony Ming
Center for Entrepreneurship.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.396

[birds chirping]

02:01.037 --> 02:03.080
Parasites, all of them.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.792
Trying to latch on
to the fattest bull here.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.504
Perks of slapping your name
on a building, I guess.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.757
If only they knew, right?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.928
Took an eight-course steak dinner
and a half bottle of Macallan 25

02:17.929 --> 02:21.683
to finally pull the name Jacob Monroe
from Dean Wu's mouth.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.770
Did she mention
any other fun details about me?

02:26.771 --> 02:29.899
[chuckling] A dual JD, MBA,
summa cum laude.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.568
But what she couldn't tell me, though,

02:32.569 --> 02:37.157
was why your name isn't on that building
when you funded most of it.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.952
I prefer to keep quiet
about the causes I support.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.622
It's a shame.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.456
The Monroe Center.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.084
I'd love to see more Americans
throw their weight around here.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.588
Tony was born in Cleveland, actually.

02:54.340 --> 02:58.803
How do you go about funding
all of these philanthropic endeavors?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.390
Let me save us both some time.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.933
I get the alumni bulletins.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.768
I know who you are.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.438
And I'm aware of what you're up to here.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.692
Ran your mouth a little too much,
said some things you shouldn't have,

03:13.693 --> 03:15.777
and now your well's running dry.

03:15.778 --> 03:20.158
If you think I'm gonna open my checkbook
out of the goodness of my heart,

03:20.700 --> 03:23.286
or because of some collegiate brotherhood,

03:24.162 --> 03:25.914
you're about to be very disappointed.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.251
Can't blame a man for trying.

03:31.002 --> 03:31.961
Well...

03:34.088 --> 03:36.049
doesn't mean
we can't help each other though.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.219
Maybe I can do some digging,

03:39.969 --> 03:41.595
find some skeletons,

03:41.596 --> 03:44.097
find something
to edge out the competition.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.183
And in exchange?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.895
Well, that's what
negotiations are for, right?

03:51.105 --> 03:54.483
And that's where
the real fun is... isn't it?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.569

04:18.466 --> 04:20.468
[suspenseful music playing]

04:23.596 --> 04:24.430
[officer] Sir.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.099
Five men matching your description

04:27.100 --> 04:29.351
came in early this morning
to fix an issue with our HVAC.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.520
- UN workers?
- All have proper clearances.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.855
- They're on the rooftop.
- Check them out. Make sure they're legit.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.733
- What's the ETA of the evacuation?
- We're still working on it.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.111
Managed to get ahead of the morning rush,
but there's still some stragglers.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.154
As soon as you clear civilians,
let me know.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.197
All right.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.533
[music fades]

04:46.119 --> 04:47.744
- Sutherland.
- Deputy Director.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.371
I've got all sorts of questions for you.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.708
But your case officer assures me
you can answer 'em to my satisfaction.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.793
So for now, load up.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.045
Ms. Larkin,
I'd like you at the monitor with me.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.714
- Really?
- Nobody's seen Markus in years.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.507
We don't have names for the others.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.635
- You're the only one who can ID them.
- Okay.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.722
What was that about?

05:06.431 --> 05:07.432
A misunderstanding.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.482
A misunderstanding?

05:17.692 --> 05:18.609
That's good.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.861
I was hoping for an explanation

05:20.862 --> 05:23.281
that is not exactly
what the fuck it looks like.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.451
That my agent went AWOL
for the second time in a month,

05:27.452 --> 05:30.788
after absconding
with a high-value suspect.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.751
He wanted you
to do something for him, didn't he?

05:35.626 --> 05:37.003
Solomon's boss.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.297
We were running out of time.
I needed to find the mobile lab.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.924
- To find Rose.
- No, to end this.

05:42.925 --> 05:43.926
All of it.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.764
And when we do,
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.517
I'm gonna hold you to that.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.895
[tense music playing]

05:58.524 --> 06:00.360
[ominous music playing]

06:06.157 --> 06:07.492
How many left?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.202
Two more.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.747
Zann and the others
should have been here by now.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.930

06:30.181 --> 06:33.017
- I don't see Peter or Catherine here.
- Because they aren't.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.228
Not officially.

[officer 2] <i>Shots fired. Shots fired...</i>

07:09.929 --> 07:12.682
[Markus] Hurry up.
Time to move to the second target.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.689
- [officer] <i>Making entry.</i>
- We have to go! Now!

07:20.523 --> 07:21.357
Come!

07:23.568 --> 07:26.404
Split up! One of us
needs to get outside with the weapon!

Stay to the right.

- [man] Like I said, I work here.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.717
We'll see. ID check.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.845
- Yeah, he's one of them.
- [Aiden] Positive ID. Detain.

All units be advised,

He was right here.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.378

the other canisters.

We had to get the bomb squad.
Should be done within the hour.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.862
The man we captured,
could he know where Markus was headed?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.322
Claims he doesn't,
but he shed some light on motive.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.449
Markus set the canisters
to release the K.X.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.619
once the power usage
hit 200 kWh, around midday.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.288
With the UN at full capacity.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.874
About the same time
the Security Council was set to vote

14:35.875 --> 14:38.668
on how to carve Viktor Bala's dominion
into three separate countries.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.045
Markus still has enough K.X.
to kill thousands.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.007
We're sending units
to the permanent missions and residences

14:44.008 --> 14:47.010
of all Security Council members,
in case he tries to target one of them.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.178
Deputy Director.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.640
Check in with Ms. Larkin.
She's working some sort of black magic.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.769
[door opening]

14:56.562 --> 14:57.980
There you are, finally.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.566
- You find Markus?
- No, his cousin Tomás though.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.234
I've got AdVerse fired up now.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.737
Two hits in the last few weeks
that look promising.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.739
A TikToker caught him
in the background of a video

15:07.740 --> 15:09.699
meeting with this guy, George Simko.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.910
He's part of Viktor Bala's legal team.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.037
- He has an office in the Seagram Building.
- And the second hit?

15:14.038 --> 15:16.497
He mentioned someone named Sloane,
sounded like a girlfriend.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.751
As of last week, they were together
in the penthouse of the Wynnfield Hotel.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.795
Maybe one of them knows where Markus
is hiding, or where he's heading.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.922
Doesn't hurt to ask.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.298
Divide and conquer. Come on.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.009
[suspenseful music playing]

15:29.219 --> 15:30.179
[door opening]

15:30.804 --> 15:31.889
[Sloane gasping]

15:33.098 --> 15:33.973
[door closing]

15:33.974 --> 15:34.975
Tomás?

15:37.102 --> 15:38.394
I swear to Christ,

15:38.395 --> 15:41.230
you'd better have a bloody good reason
for not returning my calls.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.816
I've been worried sick!

15:43.442 --> 15:44.318
[door opening]

15:45.653 --> 15:46.987
Markus? What--

15:47.655 --> 15:49.864
- Why are you here? Where's Tomás?
- He's safe.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.242
But the three of us
need to leave the country.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.994
Why? What mess
have you got him involved in now?

15:54.995 --> 15:59.041
Oh, it's nothing. He'll explain later.
But he needs you to get the jet ready.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.292
Why didn't he call and tell me?

16:01.293 --> 16:02.920
[sirens wailing in distance]

16:04.672 --> 16:05.505
Markus!

16:05.506 --> 16:09.509
Look, he can't talk now,
but he said he'll meet us at JFK.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.844
The jet is in Teterboro.
It is always there.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.013
Wherever. He just needs it done.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.350
No, I need to talk to him.
I won't do anything until I talk to him.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.520
Talk, talk, talk.
That's all he ever did, was talk.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.022
Look where that got him.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.652
[Rose] NYPD's already here.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.779
A lot of diplomats in town
for the General Assembly

16:29.780 --> 16:31.030
stay at hotels nearby.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.700
Seagram Building's five minutes from here.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.910
I'll take the lawyer.
You two, take the girlfriend.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.247
I want you waiting at the car
when I finish.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.207
Got it.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.380
[car horns honking]

16:47.297 --> 16:49.215
[Rose] Whatever happened
between you and Catherine

16:49.216 --> 16:51.217
is more than just a misunderstanding.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.678
How did you find me, Peter?

16:54.263 --> 16:57.099
After you were taken,
I released Solomon from custody.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.727
Got me face to face with his boss,
who offered me a deal.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.896
The location of you and the mobile lab

17:04.356 --> 17:06.607
for a favor that required me
to break into the UN.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.444
And you told him to fuck off, right?

17:08.944 --> 17:11.195
- Tell me you didn't do that for me.
- Not just for you.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.449
We were running out of time, and no one
was even thinking of the name Viktor Bala.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.951
But you wouldn't have considered it
if I wasn't there.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.203
But you were there.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.539
I promised to protect you.
Some good that did.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.292
I chose to come to New York to find you.
I asked Catherine to stay.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.461
- I put myself at risk.
- To protect me.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.672
Yeah, and some good that did.

17:30.924 --> 17:31.966
Come on.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.551
[tense music playing]

17:33.552 --> 17:36.471
Never understood
why he liked wearing these so tight.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.765
But I get it now.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.892
Made him feel big.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.440
[Markus breathing deeply, exhaling]

17:49.693 --> 17:51.570
[Markus] Time for our flight, Sloane.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.406
Killing you will make things
much more complicated for me.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.410
But I'll do it if I have to. Understood?

18:01.121 --> 18:01.955
Good.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.295
[elevator chiming]

18:10.214 --> 18:11.380
[Sloane screaming]

18:11.381 --> 18:12.424
Stay here.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.759
[doorbell chiming]

18:14.760 --> 18:16.928
[Peter] Miss Killory, open up.
It's the FBI.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.806
- I have questions for you.
- [softly] Quiet.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.766
Come on, I know you're in there.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.020
If you don't open the door,
I'm gonna get hotel security to let me in.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.356
- Everything okay?
- What's all this about?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.733
- I'm trying to enjoy my breakfast.
- Sorry to bother you.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.903
Just looking to ask you a few questions
about your boyfriend, Tomás Bala.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.697
And his cousin, Markus Dargan.
Have they reached out to you?

18:36.698 --> 18:39.659
Tomás is in D.C.
for a work trip for a couple of days.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.828
What about Markus?

18:42.246 --> 18:44.705
Is someone we haven't
associated with in years.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.250
- Please, if you just let us in--
- Who the hell are you?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.502
- It doesn't matter. You have a warrant?
- No.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.338
Then let me make this simpler.
Either get one,

18:52.339 --> 18:55.425
or I'll ask the hotel
to remove you for harassment.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.808
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.146
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Universal distress signal.

19:07.896 --> 19:11.775
That means he's in there with her. Okay?
So call Catherine, alert the NYPD.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.323
Help!

19:19.199 --> 19:20.533
Get out of here, Rose!

19:20.534 --> 19:22.660
[suspenseful music playing]

19:22.661 --> 19:24.746
[shards clattering]

19:26.748 --> 19:29.459
I'll tell the cops downstairs.
Just get here now, Catherine.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.341
What do you want me to say?
Just tell them the HVAC's screwed up.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.635
Hey, can--
I'm sorry, what's wrong with the AC?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.555
Oh, don't worry, ma'am, we're fixing it.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.854
[suspenseful music continues]

19:49.980 --> 19:52.232
One step closer, and I cut her throat.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.609
- Leave.
- You know I can't do that, Markus.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.695
But we can end this, peacefully.

20:03.911 --> 20:04.870
[door opening]

20:07.080 --> 20:09.665
- Ma'am, you can't be here.
- How long has the AC been acting up?

20:09.666 --> 20:12.920
- I'm sorry, guests are not allowed here.
- Just answer the goddamn question.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.297
Forty-five minutes, give or take.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.053
Are you looking for something? Ma'am.

20:22.971 --> 20:23.889
What is that?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.016
No, don't touch it.
It has a trip wire in there.

20:27.017 --> 20:27.975
A trip wire?

20:27.976 --> 20:31.521
- How long before it reaches 200 kWh?
- Uh, running at max?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.775
- Like, eight more minutes.
- Shut the system down, close the vents.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.151
This terminal isn't working.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.362
There's one on the ground floor.
I'd have to call the manager.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.074
Then tell them
there's a chemical weapon in the building.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.534
[intense music playing]

20:45.535 --> 20:48.120
[alarm blaring]

20:48.121 --> 20:50.791
You hear that? NYPD
and hotel security will be coming up.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.752
Talk to me, and we can
figure out a solution together.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.090
[Rose panting]

20:59.091 --> 21:03.219
[Peter] Don't throw your life away
for your uncle's twisted revenge plot.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.681
If he was willing
to sacrifice his own son...

21:06.181 --> 21:08.600
I'm more of a son to Viktor
than Tomás ever was.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.280
You can't escape,
but you can get out of here alive.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.115
- Listen to him.
- Shut your mouth!

21:24.116 --> 21:25.492
- [Peter] Listen to me!
- Stay back!

21:26.368 --> 21:28.495
[alarm blaring]

21:29.788 --> 21:32.164
Let her go, Markus.
I'll walk you out of this building.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.417
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No one else has to die today.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.669
It's too late for that.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.426
I'll die a warrior. A hero.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.886
A Bala.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.429
[Sloane shrieking]

21:46.430 --> 21:47.931
[Markus grunting, groaning]

21:49.516 --> 21:50.600
You okay?

21:52.269 --> 21:55.313
The K.X., it's here. We only have
six minutes before it deploys.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.355
Get out of the building.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.316
We have to evacuate
as many people as we can.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.234
Come on.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.195
[woman] I could barely hear myself think.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.406
- [exhaling] Chemical weapon?
- That's what she said.

22:05.407 --> 22:06.782
My partner went to investigate.

22:06.783 --> 22:10.077
Take it from me,
we need to evacuate the whole building.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.121
- That could take over an hour.
- Get started.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.206
Make sure you keep everyone
as far away as possible.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.667
- You, we need to shut down the HVAC.
- [man] Okay.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.377
I... I... I can take you to the control room.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.921
Take the stairs.
Get as far down as you can. Go. Now.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.840
You have to evacuate now. Go.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.717
- Okay.
- How much time do we have left?

22:24.718 --> 22:26.052
Uh, four-ish minutes.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.386
[cell phone vibrating]

22:27.387 --> 22:28.305
[softly] Here.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.806
Yeah?

22:30.807 --> 22:34.018
We can't shut down the top four floors
through the computer terminal.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.354
- We can't get everyone out in time.
<i>- There's another way.</i>

22:36.355 --> 22:38.230
If the system senses a fire,

22:38.231 --> 22:40.274
the vents will seal automatically
to smother it,

22:40.275 --> 22:42.360
which will trap the K.X. inside.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.487
but the sensors are back upstairs.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.572
[Peter] <i>I'm on my way up.</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:47.656
Give it a minute, then go down.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.575
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:49.993 --> 22:52.244
Ma'am, FBI, get out of the building, now.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.205
[woman] Okay.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.167
- Come on. Come on.
- [keyboard clacking]

22:58.168 --> 22:59.544
Come on. Come on.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.381
- Rose.
- I helped make it, I'm gonna help stop it.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.591
What are you looking for?

23:05.634 --> 23:09.011
Anything that'll burn. Okay?
Towels, sheets, toilet paper...

23:09.012 --> 23:11.555
- Are there any matches?
- No. The HVAC will blow those out.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.810
- We need something bigger, faster.
- Well, I'm open to better ideas.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.062
- Sulfuric acid.
- What?

23:18.063 --> 23:20.272
Sulfuric acid and ethanol
will spontaneously combust

23:20.273 --> 23:23.442
Dr. Cole taught me that.
Just trust me. We need to find some...

23:23.443 --> 23:24.360
Ethanol.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.779
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

23:35.622 --> 23:36.498
[door closing]

23:39.960 --> 23:40.794
[door opening]

23:42.129 --> 23:43.129
[door closing]

23:43.130 --> 23:45.297
Check how much time we have left,
I'll find the sensor.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.299
Okay.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.345
A minute, maybe less.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.265
- Up there. Come on.
- [Rose] Okay.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.413
- How much?
- The whole thing.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.170
Stand back.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.928
- Rose.
- Just give it a second.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.224
Rose.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.392
[sizzling]

24:38.393 --> 24:39.311
Look.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.749
[music fades]

25:01.750 --> 25:02.792
[both panting]

25:03.793 --> 25:05.795
[dramatic music playing]

25:10.091 --> 25:11.927
Floors 13 to penthouse sealed!

25:13.136 --> 25:14.304
[man chuckling]

25:23.355 --> 25:24.439
[Viktor exhaling]

25:26.399 --> 25:27.275
[phone beeping]

25:28.193 --> 25:32.280
Tell me, George,
how many souls shall I pray for today?

25:37.285 --> 25:39.287
[dramatic music playing]

25:40.997 --> 25:42.999
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

25:43.708 --> 25:45.502
Hey. Come here.

25:50.131 --> 25:53.593
When we go outside,
I'm gonna turn myself in

25:54.219 --> 25:56.179
and admit everything to Catherine.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.847
I don't know what'll happen next.

25:58.848 --> 26:02.352
I'll spend the rest of my life
in a... in a cell. I--

26:02.978 --> 26:03.895
I don't know.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.397
But, um...

26:07.440 --> 26:09.067
I need you to promise me something.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.153
As long as I'm a night agent,

26:12.821 --> 26:15.490
people are gonna try
to use you to get to me.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.534
Because they know

26:18.910 --> 26:20.036
that your safety...

26:23.915 --> 26:27.085
That you mean everything to me.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.589
And as long as you come searching for me,

26:32.215 --> 26:33.090
you'll be at risk.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.008
Peter, I--

26:34.009 --> 26:35.010
Tell me I'm wrong.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.013
[Rose sighing]

26:39.055 --> 26:39.931
You aren't.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.558
[Rose exhaling]

26:42.559 --> 26:43.977
[Rose] I'm just tired.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.023
I'm just tired of running and...

26:51.109 --> 26:52.944
I just want a normal life.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.071
You deserve one.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.616
- But I--
- Promise me.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.077
You're not gonna wait for me to call.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.624
If you hear I'm in trouble,
you won't come looking for me.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.002
Just forget about me.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.546
I can't.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.094
[Rose sniffling]

27:19.971 --> 27:20.847
[Peter kissing]

27:23.433 --> 27:25.894
- [crowd clamoring]
- [indistinct chatter]

27:28.313 --> 27:29.981
- [officer] <i>Stand down.</i>
- Thank you.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.488
We couldn't have stopped this
without you, Rose.

27:36.988 --> 27:37.822
Thank you.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.492
You ready?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.327
Yeah.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.837
We don't need to do it out here.

28:15.026 --> 28:15.944
[cuffs clanking]

28:34.504 --> 28:35.964
[car engine starting]

28:45.682 --> 28:47.726
[music fades]

28:53.398 --> 28:55.275
Peter Sutherland, session 2--

28:56.443 --> 28:58.903
Peter Sutherland Jr., session 2.

29:14.502 --> 29:18.005
In our previous session, Peter,
you admitted to releasing Solomon Vega,

29:18.006 --> 29:22.051
a suspect in an active
Night Action investigation, from custody.

29:23.219 --> 29:26.306
You also admitted to breaking
and entering into the United Nations.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.184
To stealing sensitive information
from the office of the secretary general,

29:30.185 --> 29:32.437
the contents of which
are currently unknown.

29:33.521 --> 29:36.815
And to transferring said information
to an unnamed associate of Mr. Vega.

29:36.816 --> 29:40.153
A-- What was the term you used?

29:40.695 --> 29:42.614
[Catherine] An "intelligence broker."

29:44.199 --> 29:46.242
[Aiden] Is that a fair summary of events?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.287
Uh, yes, sir. It is.

29:50.830 --> 29:54.042
[Aiden] I'd like to run through things
again, from the beginning.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.085
Make sure we cover everything.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.129
Any questions before we start?

29:59.130 --> 30:00.924
No, uh, sir. Um...

30:02.133 --> 30:03.051
I'm ready.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.429
[dramatic music playing]

30:08.473 --> 30:10.724
[man] A little more. Think you can get it?

30:10.725 --> 30:11.934
[woman] That's perfect.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.436
- Yeah.
- Just-- On your left.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.730
[man] Hold on. Hold on.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.317
- [Chelsea] Your briefcase, sir.
- Of course.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.737
Spread your arms and legs, please.

30:23.905 --> 30:24.948
A second pat down?

30:25.532 --> 30:29.326
I'm flattered you think a man of my age
could pose much of a threat.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.411
This close to the election,
we like to be thorough.

30:31.412 --> 30:34.665
Absolutely. Last thing we need
is American democracy

30:34.666 --> 30:37.292
subverted by a young buck
with a switchblade.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.962
Or an old fossil with a laptop.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.339
[Jacob chuckling]

30:42.882 --> 30:44.132
Governor Hagan is ready for you.

30:44.133 --> 30:46.219
[tense music playing]

30:59.774 --> 31:01.233
[Hagan chuckling]

31:01.234 --> 31:03.862
Oh, he did not just say that.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.197
- Think it'll do the trick?
- Oh, it's good.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.701
It's too, too good.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.913
Yeah. Eight years,
three elections together.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.082
This is your magnum opus.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.041
[knocking on door]

31:18.042 --> 31:21.129
- [Chelsea] Five minutes, Governor.
- Wanna stay around for the speech?

31:22.255 --> 31:23.131
I should get going.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.926
- This is mine to keep, right?
- [Jacob] It is.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.470
I retain the less relevant
materials for myself.

31:30.471 --> 31:34.475
No, of course. Keep it.
It's important to reward good work.

31:38.855 --> 31:42.357
Let's not forget who works for whom.

31:42.358 --> 31:44.277
[ominous music playing]

31:49.198 --> 31:50.199
[Hagan exhaling]

31:50.867 --> 31:53.536
Did I ever tell you
the story of these boots, Jacob?

31:54.662 --> 31:55.579
No?

31:55.580 --> 31:59.541
Well, it was a couple years before we met.
I was running for State House.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.502
I was trailing by a pretty healthy margin.

32:02.503 --> 32:06.048
I don't know who, don't know how,
but some journalist heard from somewhere

32:06.049 --> 32:08.634
that the boots that I wore
on the campaign trail

32:08.635 --> 32:10.053
belonged to my great uncle.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.931
And the voters, they ate it up.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.974
"There's a man who respects the past,

32:15.975 --> 32:18.394
respects his history, American values."

32:19.062 --> 32:20.187
And the polls?

32:20.188 --> 32:21.396
[Hagan whistling]

32:21.397 --> 32:23.942
Won that race by nine points.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.236
Now, if that journalist
had bothered to fact-check even a little,

32:28.237 --> 32:30.489
he would've learned that

32:30.490 --> 32:33.409
I bought these in a thrift store
the year before.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.828
But he didn't.

32:36.746 --> 32:40.166
And, uh...
yeah, it taught me a valuable lesson.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.678
Sometimes, it's better just to let people
believe what they want about you.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.264
[Hagan chuckling]

32:56.265 --> 32:57.433
Have a good night.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.184
[case clattering]

32:59.185 --> 33:01.270
[ominous music playing]

33:03.815 --> 33:04.899
[door opening]

33:06.567 --> 33:07.484
[door closing]

33:07.485 --> 33:11.071
DHS has expedited
your permanent resident applications,

33:11.072 --> 33:12.781
but your asylum claims have been approved.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.867
[phone ringing in distance]

33:15.368 --> 33:16.868
[in Farsi] They've granted our asylum.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.955
[woman in English] You've each been issued
a Social Security number.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.373
The cards are inside.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.793
You can use those to apply
for various aid programs, SNAP, TANF...

33:24.794 --> 33:26.754
All the details are in the folder.

33:32.135 --> 33:32.968
And this?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.886
I wasn't told the particulars
of your situation,

33:34.887 --> 33:37.264
but checks like those are used
to reimburse you

33:37.265 --> 33:40.351
for any loss or damages suffered
in service of the U.S. government.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.688
This is what America thinks
my brother was worth?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.566
[woman] Again, I'm not familiar
with your situation.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.735
I'm just here to take you
through next steps.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.069
[in Farsi] I don't understand.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.237
What's wrong?

33:52.238 --> 33:53.197
What is it for?

33:54.407 --> 33:55.907
Nothing to worry about.
It can wait until later.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.576
[woman in English]
I'll be in touch when I have updates.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.372
But until then,
welcome to the United States of America.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.167
[dramatic music playing]

34:09.255 --> 34:10.715
[Noor sighing]

34:17.096 --> 34:19.098
[indistinct chatter]

34:28.524 --> 34:30.902
- I'm going to go on my lunch break.
- All right.

34:32.653 --> 34:33.488
Hey.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.159
[music fades]

34:39.160 --> 34:40.828
[indistinct chatter]

34:41.537 --> 34:42.538
How did you find me?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.666
Turns out I have connections
in high places.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.461
- Oh my God, you made this?
- Mm-hmm.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.462
It's incredible.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.631
[Noor] It's okay.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.425
Doesn't quite taste like home though.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.052
How's your mom?

34:57.053 --> 34:59.931
Last week,
she refused to get out of bed or eat.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.683
This week, she's eating a little.

35:03.851 --> 35:08.898
But all she really does is stare at photos
of Farhad all day on her phone.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.610
The worst thing is,
I think he would have really loved it here

35:13.611 --> 35:15.154
if he had given it a chance.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.243
I'm so sorry for everything, Noor.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.413
I know. Thank you.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.582
Well, do you like working here at least?

35:27.583 --> 35:28.918
[Noor] Gets me out of the house.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.380
I'm applying to some new jobs,

35:33.297 --> 35:36.133
but they can't verify my degree
with my university back home,

35:36.134 --> 35:40.805
so I'll probably have to retake
some classes here.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.724
Some days...

35:45.184 --> 35:47.686
every day, I just hope it will get better.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.895
It will.

35:48.896 --> 35:52.440
Once you find a job that you like,
you make friends...

35:52.441 --> 35:54.485
You can always call me whenever you want.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.028
[Noor exhaling]

35:57.655 --> 35:58.613
How are you doing?

35:58.614 --> 36:01.659
I'm good. I'm back in California.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.994
I'm buried in work with my promotion.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.039
I'm doing therapy twice a week. It's good.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.877
I feel like I can finally
start my life again.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.087
And Peter?

36:15.590 --> 36:16.465
I don't know.

36:19.218 --> 36:22.262
But I... I think it's better that way.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.348
[somber music playing]

36:25.433 --> 36:26.266
[cell phone chiming]

36:26.267 --> 36:27.434
- [woman] Check it out.
- [woman 2] No way.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.852
- [Rose] You see this?
- [man] He dropped out.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.061
- [woman] He's out?
- See what?

36:30.062 --> 36:31.188
[man] He's out of the race?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.274
[tense music playing]

36:40.656 --> 36:42.116
Let's go for a walk.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.790
So you guys figure out
what to do with me yet?

36:51.417 --> 36:52.293
Not yet.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.088
You've missed out on a lot
these last couple of weeks.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.389
"In an unprecedented move,
Patrick Knox withdrew his candidacy

37:06.390 --> 37:08.558
for president
of the United States last night,

37:08.559 --> 37:10.685
just two weeks
before the general election."

37:10.686 --> 37:13.021
Apparently,
when he was director of the CIA,

37:13.022 --> 37:16.691
Patrick Knox spearheaded a classified
chemical-weapons program.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.818
Foxglove?

37:18.611 --> 37:19.612
Knox authorized it?

37:20.321 --> 37:24.617
He also oversaw the sale
of Foxglove weapons to Viktor Bala.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.292
Figured all this out after the attack?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.837
From the archive I stole
from the secretary general's computer?

37:37.838 --> 37:40.131
<i>The New York Times</i>
received an audio recording

37:40.132 --> 37:41.716
from an anonymous source.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.926
One of Knox's deputies

37:42.927 --> 37:46.680
offering Viktor Bala
samples from Project Foxglove.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.515
Recordings were found years ago

37:48.516 --> 37:51.893
during the UN's investigation
into Bala's use of chemical weapons,

37:51.894 --> 37:55.605
but... never made it into evidence.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.441
I don't get it. Why would the broker
want me to get this for him?

37:58.442 --> 38:00.443
I suspect it was his plan all along.

38:00.444 --> 38:04.030
Use the chaos of the attack
to slip someone into the UN,

38:04.031 --> 38:06.908
finding the smoking gun
tying Knox to Foxglove.

38:06.909 --> 38:07.827
For what?

38:09.495 --> 38:12.539
Governor Hagan's virtually guaranteed
the presidency now.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.209
[Peter] So America spends the next four
years pursuing an isolationist agenda,

38:16.210 --> 38:19.255
and the demand
for an intelligence broker skyrockets.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.383
You saying I swung
a presidential election?

38:23.384 --> 38:24.301
[Catherine] No.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.386
I'm saying you aided and abetted

38:26.387 --> 38:28.973
in the swinging
of a presidential election.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.107
[woman] Do you see?

38:39.108 --> 38:41.193
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

38:45.823 --> 38:48.034
I haven't been completely honest with you.

38:48.993 --> 38:53.079
Early in my career, I worked
one of the biggest Night Actions to date.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.998
My partner and I, we were charged

38:54.999 --> 38:57.543
with finding the mole
in the Pentagon breach.

39:01.088 --> 39:04.424
- You investigated my father?
- That is eventually where it led, yes.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.634
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to give you a fair shot.

39:06.635 --> 39:11.891
And telling you, it would have soured
our relationship from jump.

39:12.892 --> 39:16.729
I watched as Jamie Hawkins
turned your father into a double agent.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.106
And the thing that finally turned him...

39:20.441 --> 39:21.275
was you.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.693
He said if the truth ever got out,

39:23.694 --> 39:26.404
he wanted his son to know
that he did what he could

39:26.405 --> 39:28.031
to make up for his mistakes.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.367
To atone.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.703
- Do you want a chance to make this right?
- Just tell me how.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.205
[dramatic music playing]

39:35.206 --> 39:36.123
A new mission.

39:36.791 --> 39:40.126
There's a strong possibility
that this broker is working with

39:40.127 --> 39:42.545
or about to control a sitting president,

39:42.546 --> 39:45.548
and that every piece
of classified intelligence

39:45.549 --> 39:47.592
that crosses the Resolute Desk

39:47.593 --> 39:49.678
is up for sale to the highest bidder.

39:50.262 --> 39:55.058
We need you to determine
the exact nature of their relationship.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.768
What makes you think
I can figure that out?

39:56.769 --> 39:59.229
The broker removed
all traces of you at the UN.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.189
He wants you around for some reason.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.526
Maybe as an insurance policy
on his biggest asset?

40:04.527 --> 40:06.486
Or as a check
on the man he's about to crown

40:06.487 --> 40:08.071
the most powerful person in the world.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.490
Well, in any case,
he still believes he owns you.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.702
So... we're gonna let him.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.914
There's going to be a day
when he will call on you for a favor,

40:17.915 --> 40:19.667
or to give orders.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.252
And when he does,

40:22.253 --> 40:25.423
I want you to do exactly as he asks.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.216
Gain his trust,

40:27.716 --> 40:30.009
uncover every snake on his payroll.

40:30.010 --> 40:33.097
And then, expose, destroy.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.474
If it leads all the way up
to the Oval Office?

40:38.477 --> 40:40.562
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.648
In the meantime,
this mission is top secret,

40:43.649 --> 40:45.275
even from Night Action,

40:45.276 --> 40:47.735
which will make it
difficult and dangerous.

40:47.736 --> 40:51.574
But if you're game,
Mosley and I will wipe your slate clean.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.451
So...

40:54.034 --> 40:55.494
You already know I'm in.

40:56.954 --> 40:57.955
What happens now?

40:59.373 --> 41:02.501
Now, you wait for him to call.
