WEBVTT

00:31.708 --> 00:35.666
"I HAVE FIVE DRAWERS IN MY MIND.

00:35.750 --> 00:40.458
THE THREE TOP DRAWERS I OPEN ALL THE TIME.
THE FOURTH, LESS OFTEN.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.458
I CLOSED THE BOTTOM DRAWER MAY 8TH, 1945
AND HAVEN'T OPENED IT SINCE."

01:15.791 --> 01:18.458
REPORT FROM "NO. 24"

01:27.375 --> 01:29.041
-Hi. We are ready.
-Hi. Yes.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.666
-Can you put the mic on?
-Yes. We'll be out soon.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.250
-Great, thanks.
-Yep.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.750
-Ready, Gunnar?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:38.875 --> 01:39.916
I'm ready.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.000
Are you good?

01:48.083 --> 01:50.375
Yeah, I'm better.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.083
It goes after a while.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.166
Yeah.

02:03.583 --> 02:04.958
-Pleased to meet you. Welcome.
-Yes.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.583
-Thank you, thanks.
-Hello, I'm Petter.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.500
-Hi, welcome.
-Petter. Hi.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.250
Shh.

02:15.708 --> 02:19.375
Yes, yes.
Were you expecting old folk here, huh?

02:26.583 --> 02:29.958
Let's talk about, uh… values.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.708
Are you tired yet?

03:08.708 --> 03:10.208
This is incredible.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.291
What?

03:14.208 --> 03:16.166
NAZI BOOK BURNING
CAUSES INTERNATIONAL WORRY

03:16.250 --> 03:17.333
Book burning?

03:20.916 --> 03:22.583
I got a book from my father.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.333
A guy called Langhoff,

03:25.416 --> 03:28.500
who has written about his stay
in a German concentration camp.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.166
They'll burn that in no time.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.250
Concentration camp?

03:33.208 --> 03:36.708
Yes. It says they've been detaining folk
who are against the regime.

03:37.583 --> 03:38.666
Communists, then?

03:39.166 --> 03:40.916
A mix of people, I think.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.041
It's called The Peat Bog Soldiers.

03:43.541 --> 03:45.208
Køhn has it in his bookshop.

03:46.916 --> 03:48.208
Or I can lend you mine.

03:50.500 --> 03:54.083
I understand they're doing that, um,
to keep the communists under control.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.625
It's the same here as well.

03:57.666 --> 04:00.000
Or else, I mean, it's Moscow for us all.

04:01.791 --> 04:03.833
You're not hearing what you're saying,
are you?

04:07.166 --> 04:08.958
Shouldn't people be free
to say what they want?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.125
Sure. Sure.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.625
This is not about communism.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.708
We should be allowed to speak
and not go to jail.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.125
Yeah, but you get what I mean, right?

04:22.250 --> 04:24.166
No, I don't know what you mean.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.791
Let's boil the water.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.541
Yeah, here you go.

04:37.166 --> 04:40.875
I went to
the same school as you over 70 years ago.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.208
We lived in a democracy.

04:47.750 --> 04:52.333
But… some of us felt it
starting to tighten around us.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.875
Does everyone here feel secure?

05:01.458 --> 05:02.916
Yes, good.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.833
I also felt most secure.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.625
All companions of mine,

05:08.500 --> 05:09.958
they also felt secure,

05:10.583 --> 05:12.541
right to when we were not any longer.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.541
For, of course, we thought
we were living in a post-war state,

05:16.625 --> 05:18.083
when we suddenly became aware

05:19.125 --> 05:21.250
we had been living in the interwar state.

05:22.875 --> 05:25.833
And the Germans trooped in
the 9th of April, 1940.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.208
They needed barely 800 soldiers
to take over Oslo.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.916
Yes, about twice as many people
are sitting here.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.333
In a war,
you have to figure out if you want

05:38.416 --> 05:41.208
to accept the situation you are in…

05:44.041 --> 05:47.166
and to embrace what's going
to become your new reality…

05:47.250 --> 05:49.708
or stand up against it
and thus risk everything.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.583
I continued to go to work.

05:56.541 --> 05:58.958
But I had a hard time concentrating.

06:03.541 --> 06:04.708
Everybody out!

06:06.000 --> 06:07.333
Come on, everyone!

06:22.208 --> 06:24.083
You're not easily startled, are you…

06:25.125 --> 06:26.125
Sønsteby?

06:27.083 --> 06:30.083
One can feel a little defiant at times.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.375
And how defiant would that be, exactly?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.291
Somewhat defiant.

06:46.625 --> 06:50.500
There are a few of us who have talked
about taking a trip out to Marka.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.625
Would you be interested in coming with us?

07:06.666 --> 07:08.291
What else could we do?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.666
We had to try to fight back.

07:14.291 --> 07:15.666
Sønsteby. Here.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.791
Yup.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.541
But the Germans were
already everywhere.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.125
-Get down.
-What's that?

07:26.666 --> 07:27.750
Bomb!

07:27.833 --> 07:29.250
-Run!
-Move it!

07:29.958 --> 07:31.375
Keep going!

07:31.458 --> 07:33.125
It was futile.

07:35.708 --> 07:37.416
Form a line! Form a line!

07:40.083 --> 07:41.916
-Fall back!
-Fall back!

07:42.458 --> 07:43.708
Watch out!

07:45.125 --> 07:47.041
We didn't stand a chance.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.250
Here!

08:06.958 --> 08:08.166
Move it!

08:10.833 --> 08:12.916
Retreat! Retreat!

08:13.416 --> 08:14.708
Retreat!

08:18.750 --> 08:21.333
-Stop!
-There'll be covering fire!

08:22.958 --> 08:25.083
We were so damn unprepared.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.708
And I promised myself

08:34.791 --> 08:37.791
that I would never again
be so unprepared for anything.

08:48.291 --> 08:51.416
I myself got pneumonia
and terrible sinusitis.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.166
In fact, I was told not to move
for two whole years.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.625
People say that health is
the most important thing.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.375
PRIME MINISTER QUISLING
EXPLAINS POLITICAL PLANS.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.875
But that's not true.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.750
Peace and freedom trumps everything.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.833
And after two months or so,

09:10.916 --> 09:13.916
I met other men who were just like myself.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.083
This is London.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.625
On days like these, there
are probably many people in Norway

09:18.708 --> 09:20.750
who are trying to keep their spirits up.

09:20.833 --> 09:23.000
Or are they beginning to lose heart?

09:23.750 --> 09:27.708
And they were Knut Haugland,
who I knew from Rjukan,

09:27.791 --> 09:28.916
and Max Manus,

09:29.750 --> 09:31.000
Andreas Aubert,

09:31.833 --> 09:33.125
Gregers Gram,

09:33.750 --> 09:35.791
and Tallak, Edvard Tallaksen.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.291
Oh, I missed that one.

09:38.416 --> 09:41.833
Here I put my background
as an accountant to good use.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.166
I became Erling Fjeld,

09:45.250 --> 09:48.250
Gunnar Lier, Harald Sørensen.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.416
The bakery in Grønland,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.541
with Reidun Andersen in charge,

09:53.625 --> 09:54.875
became a hub for us.

09:58.833 --> 10:02.791
It was all well we were making
a newspaper, but we wanted better.

10:03.791 --> 10:06.458
The Norwegian government
had fled to London.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.833
I got word
that they had a representative

10:09.916 --> 10:11.875
at the British legation in Sweden.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.041
NORWAY - SWEDEN

10:13.750 --> 10:15.250
I wanted to meet him.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.666
THE BRITISH LEGATION - STOCKHOLM

10:18.750 --> 10:21.125
We need to build up
a network in Oslo.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.291
All right.

10:23.500 --> 10:27.375
But if you would rather go to England
to be trained in sabotage,

10:27.875 --> 10:30.000
I'm certain we could send you over there.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.708
-Thank you, but I will stay in Oslo, sir.
-Okay.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.833
Your codename is…

10:38.875 --> 10:40.041
Number 24.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.250
There you go.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.250
Your first assignment.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.583
BANK OF NORWAY

11:22.750 --> 11:24.791
-Forfang.
-Erling Fjeld.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.000
Ivar Thidemansen has asked me to meet you.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.166
Yes.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.583
So, why are you here, then?

11:46.833 --> 11:49.291
The Norwegian government
in London has employed me

11:49.375 --> 11:52.958
to come to you to borrow
the banknote printing plates.

11:58.708 --> 12:04.125
You… wish for a loan of our printing
plates for the Norwegian banknotes?

12:05.083 --> 12:05.916
Yes.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.458
Resistance work costs money,
as you can imagine, sir.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.375
And we also need a sample
of the paper being used.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.333
Hello, Miss Løberg?

12:29.291 --> 12:31.791
Thank you for an… interesting chat.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.458
What must I do for you to trust me?

12:40.541 --> 12:41.958
This meeting is over.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.541
Miss Løberg will show you the way out.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.583
Mr. Fjeld?

12:54.791 --> 12:56.125
Mr. Fjeld?

13:03.625 --> 13:05.833
Your grandchildren will
be speaking German.

13:06.708 --> 13:07.916
What was that?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.625
You do understand
that if action is not taken now,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.166
your grandchildren
will be speaking German?

13:14.250 --> 13:18.291
Here, you have a chance
to stand on the right side of history.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.291
How do I know that you are
a representative of the government?

13:31.083 --> 13:32.708
How can I be sure of that?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.666
-You will have to trust me.
-Ah.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.708
Easy for you to say.

13:38.583 --> 13:41.083
If this goes wrong, I'll get shot.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.000
And the bank manager and the entire board.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.166
That goes for all of us.

14:08.416 --> 14:09.916
If you are who you say,

14:10.833 --> 14:14.375
then make the speaker from London
say this on the radio

14:14.458 --> 14:15.833
the day after tomorrow.

14:17.250 --> 14:18.958
Then I will consider the matter.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.083
THE ETERNAL LONGING

14:39.500 --> 14:40.916
This is London.

14:41.833 --> 14:46.208
In days like these,
it's important to keep your spirits up.

14:46.791 --> 14:49.041
Here are 16 special messages.

14:49.916 --> 14:52.208
One. A man you can trust.

14:53.916 --> 14:56.541
Two. A long spear in the fist.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.875
Three.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.541
The eternal longing.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.083
Four. Looks like a school.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.083
Five…

15:33.541 --> 15:35.708
I hope that you know what you're doing.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.375
You have until Thursday evening.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.541
So, uh, where are we going today?

16:11.625 --> 16:13.458
Please go to Kongsvinger.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.666
-Hmm.
-I have a package to get to Sweden.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.083
So send that, then.

16:36.541 --> 16:37.583
It's here.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.625
A festive meeting
in the town hall.

16:51.708 --> 16:55.000
National commissioner Terboven
and Minister President Quisling

16:55.083 --> 16:58.000
were photographed together
as the company's protectors.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.041
Under the leadership of Captain Maxvik,

17:00.125 --> 17:02.250
the company marched
through Oslo's streets.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.750
Hirden's school in Kongsvinger

17:11.833 --> 17:14.291
has completed a soldier training course.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.333
Chief of State Police Marthinsen
handed out letters of appointment

17:18.416 --> 17:20.791
to the new troop leaders
and superintendents.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.833
That man is worse than Quisling.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.875
Then followed by a simple social evening.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.875
Marthinsen
was head of the State Police

17:32.958 --> 17:35.250
and also the supreme leader
of the Hirden.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.958
He allowed his people
to torture Norwegians.

17:40.666 --> 17:45.125
And the Norwegian Nazis were quite
frequently worse than the German Nazis.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.166
I could not understand
how our fellow countrymen

17:49.250 --> 17:52.291
could collaborate
with those who had occupied us.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.250
It made it difficult to know who to trust.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.083
The government in London needed
eyes and ears in Oslo.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.375
And I was appointed leader
of our little organisation.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.000
The information was collected
and then smuggled over to Sweden.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.125
And from there,
transported on to London.

18:37.375 --> 18:40.833
But the Gestapo had now become aware
of the resistance movement

18:40.916 --> 18:42.166
that was building up.

18:43.916 --> 18:46.541
Our people were arrested
all over the country.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.708
The Germans wanted
to get hold of those in charge.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.208
Turn him.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.250
Why Hornbæk?
Why can't he just drive to Kongsvinger?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.041
Andreas wants to talk to you.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.208
He said that…

19:18.958 --> 19:20.958
He said…

19:31.791 --> 19:32.875
What was that?

19:36.500 --> 19:39.708
The Germans poured boiling oil
up Kristian's rectum.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.500
Andreas' brother.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.583
He burned from the inside.

19:50.708 --> 19:51.750
Andreas.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.416
Condolences for Kristian.

20:06.583 --> 20:07.958
He was outstanding.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.458
Yes, he was.

20:21.083 --> 20:24.000
What kind of people would do that? Hmm?

20:26.166 --> 20:27.541
Who does that?

20:32.125 --> 20:34.000
All of us understand if you want out.

20:34.541 --> 20:36.666
Out? What are you talking about?

20:37.500 --> 20:40.583
I want to do the hard things. You follow?

20:49.125 --> 20:50.583
-Hi.
-Hello.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.125
She's here.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.666
Okay.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.541
Hello.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.291
Krogh.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.708
Gudrun Collett.

21:03.791 --> 21:04.833
Krogh?

21:05.333 --> 21:06.958
But isn't it Fjeld?

21:07.041 --> 21:10.291
Krogh, Fjeld, um…
Five pockets, one for each man.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.000
Then it's just a matter
of keeping them straight.

21:17.750 --> 21:18.750
You fix things?

21:18.833 --> 21:21.000
Yes. Well, you might say that.

21:21.583 --> 21:24.583
-You need access to more apartments?
-Yes.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.083
Why so many?

21:28.083 --> 21:29.708
I never sleep two nights
in the same place.

21:34.291 --> 21:38.458
Through Mrs. Collett,
I got access to a network of apartments.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.416
I just followed the logic of the Germans.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.666
For their job was all day, every day
to methodically search,

21:46.750 --> 21:49.541
trying to predict
where we could be found and get to us.

21:52.375 --> 21:55.125
The Germans usually came to get people

21:55.208 --> 21:58.291
between four and six in the morning.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.750
So I got up every day at half past four.

22:04.833 --> 22:07.416
I was out on the street
within a few minutes,

22:08.666 --> 22:11.375
and then I usually went into the woods

22:11.916 --> 22:13.958
to get a few extra hours of sleep

22:14.041 --> 22:16.000
before heading back to the city.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.583
We open again in the morning.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.500
Closed.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.583
Thank you so much, miss.

22:35.875 --> 22:36.916
Ah…

22:38.250 --> 22:39.833
It's a lovely scent of baking.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.375
Mmm.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.166
May I?

22:50.458 --> 22:51.458
Reidun?

23:13.333 --> 23:14.333
Please.

23:27.458 --> 23:28.583
Get the prisoners.

23:29.791 --> 23:30.875
Next.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.000
Do you know who this is?

23:39.166 --> 23:40.333
Look at him.

23:45.916 --> 23:46.833
Next.

23:57.666 --> 23:58.750
What about him?

24:01.333 --> 24:02.458
I don't know.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.625
Are you sure?

24:07.541 --> 24:08.666
Mmm.

24:37.750 --> 24:38.833
No.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
-I didn't say anything.
-Uh…

25:10.791 --> 25:11.791
Anything.

25:14.291 --> 25:15.333
Okay.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.000
I saw several of ours.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.208
I saw Solnørdal.

25:26.416 --> 25:28.208
I don't know how long he can hold up.

25:33.583 --> 25:34.666
They'll do anything

25:35.708 --> 25:37.333
to find out your real identity.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.208
Okay.

26:23.875 --> 26:24.916
Mmm!

26:38.166 --> 26:39.708
What are you up to these days?

26:43.291 --> 26:44.791
You don't want to know.

26:47.166 --> 26:51.083
But, um… you were given permission
for travel to Rjukan?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.041
Look…

27:09.041 --> 27:10.041
I…

27:11.208 --> 27:13.708
There are a lot of people looking for me.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.875
And there will more,
I'm inclined to believe.

27:23.583 --> 27:26.875
And I can't quite shake the thought
that they could come and…

27:28.875 --> 27:31.000
and that they could come here after you.

27:45.958 --> 27:47.666
You have to do your job.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.416
And we will do ours.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.500
-Hi, Gunnar.
-Hello.

29:01.333 --> 29:05.208
For the good cooperation between
the German and Norwegian law enforcement,

29:06.541 --> 29:08.291
It is very important, Mr. Marthinsen,

29:08.375 --> 29:10.375
that we quash
this terrorist activity together.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.750
Mmm. Yes.

29:13.916 --> 29:17.416
Did you get
everything he knew?

29:18.166 --> 29:21.000
That's impossible to know.

29:22.583 --> 29:26.833
No, it's not.
You just have to make an effort.

29:27.708 --> 29:29.041
They'll sing like sparrows.

29:30.125 --> 29:32.791
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Yes, certainly.

29:32.875 --> 29:34.083
Come here.

29:54.041 --> 29:55.583
It's chilly here, right?

29:57.166 --> 29:58.166
What?

30:04.791 --> 30:06.458
The name of your boss?

30:07.083 --> 30:08.541
Who is your leader?

30:09.041 --> 30:10.458
His full name.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.416
G… Gu…

30:19.833 --> 30:20.875
Gunnar.

30:21.833 --> 30:22.958
Gunnar.

30:23.666 --> 30:25.916
We need the surname as well.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.708
S… Sønsteby.

30:35.958 --> 30:37.916
-Gunnar Sønsteby?
-Yeah.

30:41.125 --> 30:42.458
There you go.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.166
That wasn't so hard.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.333
Apologies for the interruption.

30:52.958 --> 30:53.958
Not at all.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.833
But I'd say
the wait was worth it.

31:15.875 --> 31:22.166
GUNNAR SØNSTEBY
REWARD: 200 000 KR.

31:25.541 --> 31:26.625
Stop.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.666
Papers, please.

31:29.750 --> 31:30.750
Uh…

31:35.208 --> 31:36.833
Okay. Go on.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.250
Please come in, Sønsteby.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.333
Get after him!

33:05.000 --> 33:06.583
Stop!

33:24.625 --> 33:26.166
LEUCHARS, SCOTLAND - 1943

33:26.250 --> 33:28.958
Just get inside and dump them.
These aren't…

33:29.041 --> 33:32.250
Idiot! Do you know that? Leave this!

33:32.333 --> 33:33.625
Kjakabråten.

33:34.833 --> 33:35.833
There you are.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.208
-Hello.
-Very good to see you.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.416
Good to see you.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.083
It was about time you came out here.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.958
Yes, but I'll go back at the soonest.

33:46.041 --> 33:48.916
Of course. First things first, Gunnar.

33:50.791 --> 33:51.958
Erling Fjeld.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.416
Erling Fjeld.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.750
Yes, they've asked to speak to you.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.125
Have they?

34:01.208 --> 34:03.250
I tried to tell them
you're an upstanding citizen,

34:03.333 --> 34:05.166
but they're not going to surrender.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.250
Mr. Fjeld.

34:11.458 --> 34:13.375
Just tell us
one more time, Mr. Fjeld,

34:14.083 --> 34:15.916
why you have survived

34:16.000 --> 34:17.791
when so many of your contacts haven't?

34:22.791 --> 34:25.625
Some of us believe
that this is close to impossible.

34:26.458 --> 34:28.208
When something is impossible,

34:29.041 --> 34:31.875
there tends to be
a few obvious explanations.

34:33.541 --> 34:34.541
What are you saying?

34:34.625 --> 34:37.083
Not saying anything, Mr. Fjeld.
You tell us.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.291
I'm a thorough man.

34:39.375 --> 34:41.875
Very few people can be
thorough on this level over time.

34:41.958 --> 34:45.041
-What am I supposed to say to that?
-But you can?

34:45.125 --> 34:48.166
Well, I'm not saying
that I'm better than anyone.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.041
But I plan ahead all the hours I'm awake.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.041
-So do all the others.
-So do all the others.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.750
-I wish that was true.
-So there's no component of luck in this?

34:57.833 --> 35:01.083
Oh, yes. Luck and good planning.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.041
Do you drink alcohol?

35:02.125 --> 35:04.708
Not since the war started.
I find it is counterproductive.

35:04.791 --> 35:07.250
-You don't need it to calm your nerves?
-No.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.166
-What about women?
-What about them?

35:09.250 --> 35:12.208
Do you like women?
Some agents prefer male company.

35:12.291 --> 35:15.291
-Shocking as it may seem.
-Uh, yes, I do like women.

35:15.375 --> 35:17.791
How many female contacts
have you established?

35:17.875 --> 35:18.750
I'd say about five.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.166
And of those,
how many of them have you slept with?

35:21.875 --> 35:23.750
I find your questions
to be quite personal.

35:23.833 --> 35:24.833
Just answer.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.583
Zer… zero women since the war started.

35:28.666 --> 35:31.500
I find that very hard
to believe, Mr. Fjeld.

35:31.583 --> 35:33.958
Sorry, but I don't feel like
that's my responsibility.

35:34.041 --> 35:36.250
Do you do anything
at all to calm your nerves?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.375
Yes.

35:38.083 --> 35:41.250
I plan and prepare,
as I already have told you.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.583
That's the thing that calms my nerves.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.083
I'm sure you've had
quite enough of this room.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.708
I apologize on behalf of my agency,
but we had to be absolutely certain.

36:11.708 --> 36:15.208
It seems that you're one of those
rare and brilliant individualists

36:15.291 --> 36:17.583
who's able to achieve things
that others cannot.

36:19.500 --> 36:20.833
We're rather impressed.

36:22.541 --> 36:25.250
I wish you nothing but
the very best of luck in your training.

36:42.916 --> 36:45.375
After a few months
of training in Scotland,

36:45.458 --> 36:47.083
I went back to Oslo.

36:51.041 --> 36:53.875
I now felt ready to take
on bigger assignments.

36:59.208 --> 37:02.541
But first, I was to meet the new leader
of the resistance movement,

37:03.208 --> 37:04.833
Jens Christian Hauge.

37:05.583 --> 37:07.291
I got hold of eggs for breakfast.

37:22.458 --> 37:25.000
You can have a sip
of my husband's invention.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.750
Hmm.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.125
He said it helps with everything.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.666
So he thought.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.208
Apart from brain tumours,

37:36.041 --> 37:37.166
it turned out.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.291
My, uh… condolences.

37:40.791 --> 37:41.875
Thank you.

37:42.833 --> 37:45.375
But let's not get lost in melancholy.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.125
It's important to rejoice once in a while.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.083
In spite of what is facing us.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.208
When is he supposed to arrive?

37:58.875 --> 37:59.916
He's coming.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.458
Do you dance?

38:05.666 --> 38:07.375
-No.
-Hmm.

38:08.083 --> 38:11.000
You mustn't forget to breathe a little,
even if it is war.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.833
There'll be a time and a place for that.

38:16.208 --> 38:17.166
Hmm.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.250
You mean one dance?

38:25.333 --> 38:28.208
You won't be getting any more food
from me if you don't dance.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.166
Yes.

38:42.958 --> 38:45.625
-Have you danced before?
-Yes, yes.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.625
-Okay.
-Absolutely.

38:48.708 --> 38:51.041
So you put your right hand
upon my shoulder.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.416
-Mm-hmm.
-And the other hand here.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.916
I will lead first. Now.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.041
Hmm.

39:01.583 --> 39:04.208
You cannot dance with me
if you're stuck.

39:04.291 --> 39:05.291
You must take a breath.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.666
In through the nose.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.000
Out of the mouth.

39:10.083 --> 39:11.833
And again.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.250
Let's try one more time.

39:18.250 --> 39:19.708
Please try.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.000
Right.

39:24.708 --> 39:27.458
-One, two, three. One, two.
-Hmm.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.166
See? You've got it!

39:30.333 --> 39:32.208
Don't forget to breathe.

39:45.791 --> 39:47.833
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

39:54.666 --> 39:55.625
Welcome.

40:00.875 --> 40:01.916
Mr. Hauge.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.958
-Coffee?
-Yes, thank you.

40:11.041 --> 40:13.125
I'm trying to teach Number 24
to breath a little.

40:20.791 --> 40:22.291
Have you turned 25 yet?

40:23.458 --> 40:24.583
Yes.

40:25.958 --> 40:27.833
There's a chance you won't get older.

40:31.916 --> 40:33.166
Have you considered that?

40:39.541 --> 40:40.791
I can accept that.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.416
How do you think you'd respond to torture?

40:50.416 --> 40:51.541
I'm not sure.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.541
That is the only answer.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.791
We're going to work together, you and I.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.041
We have an urgent matter.

41:04.750 --> 41:05.583
Okay.

41:06.250 --> 41:09.000
Quisling and Marthinsen will
forcibly conscript Norwegian boys

41:09.083 --> 41:12.916
to fight for the Germans,
sending them to Russia as cannon fodder.

41:13.708 --> 41:16.416
3,000 men will meet
at the employment office tomorrow.

41:18.250 --> 41:21.208
Ensure that by sunrise,
it looks like a fire pit down there.

41:25.166 --> 41:28.416
Akersgata 55, it's here.

41:29.416 --> 41:31.583
An empty building. It's closed at night.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.500
We're going to blow up the archive,
and that's it.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.791
Gregers, about eight, ten kilos?

41:37.875 --> 41:39.333
Yeah. Ten could do it.

41:39.875 --> 41:42.916
Max, I spoke to Selvaag.
He can get weapons for us.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.041
Yup.

41:44.125 --> 41:46.708
Tallak, you're on
reconnaissance for Akersgata.

41:49.041 --> 41:50.500
We meet here at seven.

41:57.291 --> 41:59.958
Yes, I have a good selection.
Have a look.

42:09.375 --> 42:11.041
Akersgata 55, here you are.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.166
All this must be checked
before we meet up at seven o'clock.

42:20.666 --> 42:21.958
Yeah. Yeah.

42:23.625 --> 42:24.875
Repeat it.

42:27.375 --> 42:30.625
You said that, uh, you and, uh…

42:30.708 --> 42:33.000
You and, uh, Max…

42:36.916 --> 42:38.625
Tallak, this isn't going to work.

42:40.500 --> 42:41.958
That's, uh… No.

42:42.458 --> 42:45.916
I… I smiled at her
because we are in a café.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.625
Is smiling at people not allowed any more?
Is that how it is?

42:50.125 --> 42:52.000
Some of us feel things, even if you don't.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.750
Right. I fully understand you.
Please just give her a smile.

42:56.833 --> 42:59.916
And then when you are done
with the smiling, go back to Akersgata.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.291
I… I was just over there.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.000
-The key you were given…
-Yes.

43:11.208 --> 43:12.541
Did you check if it fits?

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
It's ready.

43:42.708 --> 43:43.708
Okay.

43:49.416 --> 43:53.625
MAY 18TH, 1944

43:57.958 --> 43:59.791
-Have you got the keys?
-Yeah.

44:09.916 --> 44:11.000
Nice place.

44:17.458 --> 44:18.541
There's people here.

44:22.958 --> 44:24.458
We will proceed as planned.

44:46.458 --> 44:48.958
Do you have to say… Let's wait…

44:51.958 --> 44:53.333
Just need to work through this…

44:53.416 --> 44:55.083
Hi. How can I help you?

44:55.583 --> 44:57.708
-What's going on here?
-We're working overtime.

44:57.791 --> 45:00.625
It's going to be very busy
tomorrow morning, so… And you?

45:01.333 --> 45:03.166
We've been ordered
to check the ventilation.

45:03.250 --> 45:06.250
Oh, yes, yes. That's nice.
It gets really stuffy in here, so…

45:06.750 --> 45:08.500
-We'll get that sorted, ma'am.
-Thank you.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.666
Yes, pass it…
pass it here, please.

45:23.291 --> 45:24.458
You know what?

45:25.458 --> 45:28.958
When I see the young like you,
standing there idle in times like this,

45:29.041 --> 45:30.708
do you know what I'm thinking of?

45:31.625 --> 45:33.708
I'm thinking, "What's going on?"

45:33.791 --> 45:35.500
If I had been young today,

45:35.583 --> 45:39.041
I'd have done anything
to kick these disgusting swines out.

45:52.041 --> 45:55.791
To be honest, it makes me want
to kick you very hard, I'm telling you.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.833
-Hmm?
-We're at work, but thank you.

46:01.916 --> 46:03.666
Max.

46:05.333 --> 46:06.458
All right, then.

46:07.875 --> 46:10.541
-I will have a sip.
-Help yourself.

46:10.625 --> 46:11.875
-Thanks for that.
-Yeah.

46:13.250 --> 46:14.708
What the hell's goin' on 'ere?

46:15.208 --> 46:16.250
No idea.

46:19.083 --> 46:20.458
It's a good question.

46:28.833 --> 46:32.458
And I'll tell you something else.
I would run if I was able.

46:32.541 --> 46:34.791
Then those bastards
wouldn't really be scared.

46:34.875 --> 46:38.875
See, in the old days,
literally no one could outrun me.

46:40.625 --> 46:43.333
-And I was really tough, too.
-Sure.

46:43.416 --> 46:46.833
In 1905, I went to Drammen
and back in a single night.

46:47.416 --> 46:49.375
There was a lady down there, you see.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.458
They don't make 'em like that any more.

46:53.791 --> 46:56.250
Back then,
there was more to love.

46:57.125 --> 46:58.791
They drank milk back then, you see.

47:25.708 --> 47:26.875
Hello.

47:28.500 --> 47:32.041
Hello! Hi!
This building will blow up shortly!

47:32.625 --> 47:34.625
So everyone needs to get out!

47:34.708 --> 47:36.375
-Now!
-Me first!

47:40.750 --> 47:43.041
In July… July, 3rd, 4th…

47:43.875 --> 47:46.000
Maybe was June. It could have been. Yeah.

47:46.083 --> 47:50.875
I was there and back to Drammen,
all in just one night.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.916
July. 5th of July. No.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.625
You should get away from here, sir.

48:01.708 --> 48:03.916
-What did you say?
-Get away!

48:05.625 --> 48:07.958
-Get away! Go!
-All right.

48:19.208 --> 48:22.625
And what do you think
it said in the newspapers the day after?

48:28.166 --> 48:29.166
That's right.

48:29.833 --> 48:30.875
Not a thing.

48:31.791 --> 48:35.000
All those stories that you see
that are published in the papers,

48:35.083 --> 48:36.083
they tell them.

48:36.166 --> 48:37.208
It's the owners.

48:37.291 --> 48:39.166
What to print
and what not to print.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.083
Every single time.

48:41.166 --> 48:45.583
So in the case of war,
well, those papers should be lit instead.

48:45.666 --> 48:47.541
They're mere kindling.

48:48.333 --> 48:49.583
Hello, this is Marthinsen.

48:59.833 --> 49:02.958
To hell with this!
I've had enough!

49:24.416 --> 49:25.791
Gustav Sønsteby?

49:27.750 --> 49:29.458
-Yes.
-You're coming with us.

49:38.333 --> 49:39.708
Just one moment.

50:30.250 --> 50:32.000
He has been sent to Grini.

50:37.583 --> 50:38.875
They know your name.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.000
They know who you are.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.458
We knew something like this might happen.

50:46.166 --> 50:49.375
Take these with you,
and always carry them, you hear that?

50:49.958 --> 50:51.916
You cannot let them take you alive.

51:16.958 --> 51:19.791
The Germans know
about this apartment.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.791
Okay, I'm leaving.

51:31.291 --> 51:32.291
Thank you.

51:37.750 --> 51:39.333
Thank you so much.

51:44.541 --> 51:45.583
Papers.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.166
The backpack too.

51:59.541 --> 52:00.541
Check it.

52:02.083 --> 52:04.000
Where are you going, Fjeld?

52:04.958 --> 52:06.041
Work.

52:06.125 --> 52:07.875
What work do you do?

52:09.708 --> 52:10.833
Insurance.

52:15.458 --> 52:17.541
What do you think? Insurance?

52:28.166 --> 52:29.250
Have a nice day.

52:30.958 --> 52:31.833
Thank you.

52:33.458 --> 52:34.625
Off you go.

52:39.708 --> 52:41.500
So they didn't recognise you?

52:43.333 --> 52:45.000
Luckily, I look unremarkable.

52:45.708 --> 52:46.541
Heh.

52:47.041 --> 52:50.250
You are many things, Gunnar.
Unremarkable is not one of them.

53:05.458 --> 53:09.458
Do you ever think about
what you're going to do when it's over?

53:11.541 --> 53:12.541
No.

53:13.833 --> 53:14.875
And why's that?

53:17.500 --> 53:19.125
I can't think of that now.

53:21.041 --> 53:23.958
I want a free country,
so everything else comes after.

53:37.125 --> 53:39.500
-It would be wise to lay low for a while.
-What?

53:40.750 --> 53:44.375
I'm just saying that I think it would
be wise to lay low for some time.

53:45.208 --> 53:46.583
Yes, that could be wise.

53:46.666 --> 53:48.000
It's chilly…

53:50.208 --> 53:51.208
What is it?

53:55.375 --> 53:56.375
I got to…

53:59.916 --> 54:01.916
know someone, someone new.

54:03.833 --> 54:05.291
New? What do you mean?

54:08.208 --> 54:09.208
A woman?

54:18.166 --> 54:20.125
I know you don't like it, but…

54:20.833 --> 54:23.500
You know, it is what it is.

54:35.833 --> 54:37.041
I have full control.

54:40.041 --> 54:41.541
How do you have full control?

54:45.875 --> 54:49.000
I've been thinking
of what I have to do if I get caught.

54:52.125 --> 54:54.916
And… I know exactly what I'll do.

55:11.750 --> 55:13.500
No one gets caught, Tallak.

55:21.333 --> 55:22.958
Kongsberg weapons factory.

55:23.041 --> 55:27.458
850 Norwegians are forced to produce
Swedish Bofors cannons for the Germans.

55:28.916 --> 55:31.875
The Allies will bomb,
even if it means killing civilians.

55:31.958 --> 55:34.625
The centre of Kongsberg
will be completely destroyed.

55:34.708 --> 55:37.416
We have a better idea.
But there could be trouble.

55:38.791 --> 55:40.500
We need to get into the factory.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Of course, the Germans have guards there,

55:43.083 --> 55:46.083
but it should be possible to do this
between two guard rounds.

55:48.625 --> 55:49.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

55:51.666 --> 55:53.958
-Where are the goods?
-What goods do you mean?

55:55.041 --> 55:57.125
-Explosives.
-That's inside.

55:58.083 --> 55:59.333
Inside what?

56:00.041 --> 56:01.166
The factory.

56:02.333 --> 56:05.166
Yeah, I've smuggled over 70 kilos
of explosives into my workbench.

56:07.291 --> 56:08.666
Who gave you that command?

56:09.250 --> 56:11.166
No, we… we thought it was a good idea.

56:12.166 --> 56:14.500
We'll have to wire it up
from the inside, you mean?

56:16.416 --> 56:17.416
That's right.

56:19.958 --> 56:23.166
The plan was for us to wire everything
so it's ready before we go in.

56:24.166 --> 56:26.750
Now we need at least ten minutes
more time in there.

56:27.541 --> 56:29.666
That's as long
as the guards spend on a round.

56:36.083 --> 56:38.708
Well, let's get to work?

57:05.625 --> 57:06.875
We have a key.

57:06.958 --> 57:09.291
Yes, but we don't want them to know that.

58:11.791 --> 58:13.666
Ten minutes.

59:10.041 --> 59:11.416
Just five more.

59:29.875 --> 59:31.291
Come on. Finish up.

59:35.541 --> 59:36.708
Three minutes.

59:51.291 --> 59:53.500
-Give me the fuse. We don't have time.
-Okay.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.208
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:09.541
-We have to get out now!
-We need to set the fuse.

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.000
-Come on!
-Yes!

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:42.416
Here! Here!

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:08.125
HOKKSUND - 20 KM FROM KONGSBERG

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:20.791
Papers, please.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.166
And step out.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.041
Good. Everything is in order.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:47.125
Drive on.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.750
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.583
-Wahey! Hey! Hey!
-Come on, then!

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.583
-Sing a song to show what we can do!
-Whoo!

01:03:19.666 --> 01:03:20.875
Let's show what we can do, eh?

01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:22.791
But it was…
They weren't very impressed with it.

01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:24.458
-They weren't very impressed with it.
-Oh!

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:26.416
-Understandably!
-New rules!

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:33.125
From here on,
I do not want to see a drop of alcohol

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:36.041
taken before, during, or after a mission.

01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:39.375
After a mission, when
everyone is accounted for,

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:40.958
then it's a different matter.

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:43.541
Do I make myself understood?

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:56.208
Are you going?

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.041
They want me over in London.

01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:05.375
-Do you know why?
-No.

01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:11.125
And no fraternising
while I'm not about.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.750
We will be disciplined.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.250
Yes.

01:04:26.791 --> 01:04:27.791
Gunnar?

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:31.666
Erling.

01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:35.291
-It's been a while.
-Oh, yes, absolutely.

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:42.500
-This is Annlaug.
-Yes, hello.

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:44.166
-Hi. Gunnar.
-Annlaug.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.833
How are you?

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.041
We've know each other
since childhood.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:50.125
We'd go hiking up the mountains
together before…

01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:51.958
before, uh, well…

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:53.541
yeah, all of it.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:56.791
How's your father managing?

01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:01.333
He's all right, thanks.

01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:07.750
And how are you?
Didn't you have a job with your father?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.916
Well, it became a bit of a mess there.

01:05:13.041 --> 01:05:15.458
Now I'm between jobs, as they say.

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:18.875
Yes, that's life.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.041
-These are difficult times.
-Mmm.

01:05:24.708 --> 01:05:25.875
Are you off on the road?

01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:27.666
No, just running errands.

01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:31.750
Busy life?

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:34.125
Yes, you could say that.

01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:38.083
-It's good to see you.
-Likewise.

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.458
-Well, see you.
-See you, then.

01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:14.125
Yes, that's really good.

01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:19.541
Thank you.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.541
Good day.

01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:34.666
Uh… Your Majesty.

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:38.166
And what are you called today?

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:40.958
-Uh…
-Erling Fjeld?

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:43.750
Harold Sørensen.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.333
An electrician from Grefsen.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.958
Your Royal Highness.

01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:51.958
Well, I was keen for the opportunity.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.375
Sadly, I must leave you now.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:57.000
Hmm. It's an honour.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.666
Ditto.

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:01.458
Have a good lunch.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:04.083
Shall we?

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:16.416
I took the liberty
of ordering for us both.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.333
Ah. Ah.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:21.416
Thank you, Your Majesty.
It looks delightful.

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.333
Bon appétit.

01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:38.083
I hear that you are accomplishing
great things at home in Oslo.

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:40.958
Thank you. I'd like to go back to do more.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.291
Ah, you know what.

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:56.500
I think your need is
greater than mine, my boy.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.333
That's kind, thank you.

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:00.333
And of course, you are going.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.875
You will go home again.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:11.708
And, God damn it, you must continue
to sabotage as much as you possibly can.

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:14.958
I do hope
they play some Beethoven…

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:22.583
I will never forget that meeting.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.291
It was as if the King himself ordered me
to kick those bastards out of the country.

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:35.375
But before I got back home,
I was to receive another message.

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:46.041
Um…

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.416
It was then that Tallak and Gregers…

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.708
They had made contact with
two German deserters from the Luftwaffe.

01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:02.083
Or at least, who they thought
were two German deserters.

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:18.000
Gregers… died at the scene.

01:09:19.333 --> 01:09:21.416
Tallak had been shot right in the face.

01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:25.625
And they brought him to Kriegslazarette.

01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:33.583
Had I been there in Oslo,
that meeting would not have gone ahead.

01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:36.166
I wouldn't have allowed it.
They wouldn't have been killed.

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:38.375
But I was not there.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:11.416
We don't really know
how one may or may not react to torture.

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.375
You crack,

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:23.125
and you're unable
to hide all those around you?

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:32.000
No one wants to be
in that situation, if it can be avoided.

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:37.583
No one can really judge you if you must.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.500
But it's costly.

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:47.750
Your new orders.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:14.333
Yeah, um, I've heard
that the resistance movement

01:12:14.416 --> 01:12:18.125
occasionally had to decide
upon the lives of other Norwegian men.

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.250
Um…

01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:24.958
Yes.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.458
Uh, have you done it?

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:33.750
Um, have you experienced war?

01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:37.083
No, I have not.

01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:40.291
But, uh, my parents have.

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:47.958
Then I think that your parents will very
likely understand what I'm talking about.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:49.708
Mmm.

01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:52.250
And to all of you, I want to say

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:54.833
that I hope that
you never have to understand it,

01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:57.208
so long as you live.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:04.083
Because what happens in war is
that subtle differences just disappear,

01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:06.000
and things become black and white.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:11.083
And all at once,
completely different rules apply.

01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:21.041
I lost eight of my dear friends
during the resistance,

01:13:21.125 --> 01:13:23.833
and that was by order of the Germans.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.291
But how would you have reacted

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:31.666
if your best friends were betrayed?

01:13:33.958 --> 01:13:35.458
I wouldn't have liked it.

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:40.208
No.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.916
But have you done it?

01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:54.291
Any other questions for me?

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:00.166
These are the worst of them.

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:04.625
They're Norwegians, all of them.

01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:10.958
Marthinsen is
the most zealous Nazi in the country,

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:12.833
but we will need more time for planning.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:16.458
I think we should start with this one.
He's an easier target.

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:21.791
He is directly responsible
for the death of several of our people.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:25.750
Take aim!

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:28.083
Fire!

01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:44.166
I can ask someone else, Gunnar,
if you find it's too unsettling.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.791
We can't ask our men to do it unless
they know we're willing to do the same.

01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:53.166
I'll take him.

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:00.083
Take someone with you.

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:09.333
And, uh… one thing we must agree upon.

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:14.666
All of this stays between you and I.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:16.791
We take it to the grave.

01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:21.333
Who's taken whom, when, where, that is
vital information you and I die with.

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.500
Do you hear me?

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.083
Excuse me.

01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:32.333
I saw that you came out from number one.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:35.916
Do you live there?

01:16:38.125 --> 01:16:39.125
Yes.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.708
Do you like it there?

01:16:43.958 --> 01:16:45.375
Why do you ask?

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:48.166
Would you say this is
a… pleasant neighbourhood?

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:51.083
Absolutely.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.375
Good neighbours?

01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.250
It varies around here.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.541
Especially nowadays.

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:05.166
Oh. What do you mean by that?

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:12.125
Have you got a neighbour
who's not so nice?

01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:15.791
You could say that.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.750
And how close to him do you live?

01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:39.416
Gunnar. It's him.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.083
I'll take another.

01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:27.208
Can't you just play a card?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.208
All in good time.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.166
Smart arse.

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:35.833
Ooh.

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:40.875
Thanks very much.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.375
You are welcome.

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:18.708
Wait!

01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:23.916
This is for you!

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.083
Yep.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.416
Hmm.

01:20:45.333 --> 01:20:49.375
Uh… have things that occurred
during the war bothered you afterwards?

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:53.208
No, because during the war I lived a life…

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.500
as extreme a life as I could,

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:59.041
so my mind never rested,

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:02.083
and I let very little get to me.

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.333
For if I'd done that,
I would have been done for.

01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:07.666
Um, well, I was…
I was thinking more that, uh…

01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:10.791
the resistance movement
and yourself killed some of our own.

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:15.500
Yes, but have we not discussed
this earlier on before?

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.166
Yes, but you didn't answer clearly,
as I see it.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.583
Apparently, it happened on…

01:21:26.791 --> 01:21:30.458
…82 occasions during the campaign.

01:21:32.291 --> 01:21:35.666
Well, now, I haven't really counted,
but I'd say that's probably correct.

01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:50.208
We took particular individuals
who were committed Nazis.

01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:53.916
And those who were about to do something

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.958
that would ensure
Norway was unable to be free again.

01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:59.416
Uh, there was no mercy at all, then?

01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.791
No.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:09.375
You can go to number two.

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:12.291
Yep.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.375
No. No.

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.583
I probably would
have switched these two.

01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:23.541
Astrup and Finn Kaas, I don't know.

01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:37.875
-That is the youngest, so eventually…
-Okay.

01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:49.250
So non-violence was never
something you ever considered?

01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:53.333
Non-violence?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.958
Yes.

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:56.833
Uh, Gandhi?

01:22:58.125 --> 01:22:59.500
If you have heard of him?

01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:01.833
Gandhi did not fight against any Nazis.

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:07.791
Non-violence is all well and good…
in theory.

01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:09.875
But that can't be done

01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:12.000
if your country is attacked

01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:15.750
by those with contempt for humanity.

01:23:16.916 --> 01:23:18.625
I think that's when it matters.

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:23.791
Hmm. Then we can both discuss in detail,
should there be another war

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.333
and we two are still alive.

01:23:26.958 --> 01:23:30.250
Okay, we'll discuss again
if a war breaks out.

01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:31.583
Yes.

01:23:32.291 --> 01:23:38.375
Well, let's go to, uh,
Captain Linge and his company.

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:43.666
For in the… the company of Linge,
there were a lot of people from Rjukan.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:46.833
Uh…

01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:48.625
Yes?

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:55.125
But had all the citizens executed
done unforgivable things?

01:23:58.125 --> 01:23:59.333
Yes.

01:23:59.416 --> 01:24:02.625
And did that sometimes have
any major consequences?

01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:07.083
Say, for example, Karl Marthinsen?

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:16.583
Now, where the Marthinsen case is
concerned, it was quite clear.

01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:19.625
So, we just
go down Blindernveien.

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:21.208
He usually drives all the way.

01:24:22.166 --> 01:24:23.416
Here, we can watch.

01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:25.250
And we can hide here.

01:24:25.958 --> 01:24:27.958
Selvaag, come give me a hand.

01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:35.750
He was responsible
for the Holocaust in Norway.

01:24:35.833 --> 01:24:38.750
He sent the Norwegian Jews
to concentration camps.

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:45.291
You can probably call him

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:48.791
the biggest mass murderer
in recent Norwegian history.

01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:52.916
So he had to be taken care of.

01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:57.000
FEBRUARY 8TH, 1945

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.541
How is your boy doing?
Did he win that ski race?

01:25:10.041 --> 01:25:12.416
Thank you for remembering.
It's actually today.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.375
Ah, today, is it?

01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:17.250
Well, wish him good luck from me.

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:18.375
Thank you.

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:23.125
It's very cold today,
isn't it?

01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:48.750
How many people
do you think it was worth sacrificing

01:25:49.333 --> 01:25:52.958
simply for you to take Marthinsen's life?

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:58.083
After we shot Marthinsen,

01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:02.250
the Germans took revenge,
that was the case.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:05.125
Well, the reprisals were so severe

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:08.750
that we stopped killing
the next people on the list.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.375
But within two nights they, uh…

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:17.166
executed 28 of us, Norwegian men,
up at the garrison.

01:26:18.166 --> 01:26:20.666
Many good members of the resistance…

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.791
and some unfortunates who'd done nothing.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:30.041
Was it worth it?

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:40.916
There's no way to answer that.

01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:45.125
What is freedom worth?

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:56.166
Someone in my family was shot
by the resistance movement.

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.125
Hmm?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.333
I said someone in my family
was shot by the resistance movement.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.416
I see. I'm sorry to hear that.

01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:09.250
Do you know what he had done?

01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:12.583
Uh, that… that's unclear.

01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:16.208
Uh, about snitching… snitching on someone.

01:27:16.958 --> 01:27:21.500
Yes. During the war,
there was a lot of that.

01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:27.541
I was hoping you might know
maybe a little more about it?

01:27:28.583 --> 01:27:31.875
Oh, yes? What… what was his name?

01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:34.791
Erling Solheim.

01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:43.000
We have received a letter.

01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.750
What that means is,
our people at the post office

01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:50.541
have managed to intercept
this letter addressed to the State Police.

01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:55.750
The sender is offering information that
could lead to you and others being caught.

01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:59.458
The letter names you and
several other people associated with you.

01:28:00.916 --> 01:28:02.791
He offers to identify you.

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:22.083
No, I'm afraid there aren't
any bells ringing with that.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.916
"To the State
Police Commissioner, Oslo."

01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:33.291
"Recently, I have come
into contact with people

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:37.458
who engage in sabotage
and other illegal activities."

01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:43.291
But now we should move on.

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:45.916
Um, or see if we can't.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.041
Thank you very much
for your questions today.

01:28:57.083 --> 01:29:00.541
"I have heard and read
so much about the bestial acts

01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:03.541
"that the so-called Home Front
has carried out."

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.791
This Solheim has to disappear

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:10.208
before he tries
to contact the Gestapo again.

01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:13.750
Will you take care of it?

01:29:20.666 --> 01:29:21.666
Yes.

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:28.500
I believe
that freedom is worth almost anything.

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:35.541
And that is why war becomes
so unbearably hard,

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:39.541
that the fronts become
impossible to overcome.

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:43.500
For it's either freedom

01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:45.833
or it's death.

01:29:55.083 --> 01:29:58.291
"I would prefer not
to give too much information in writing,

01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:02.375
but I can say that
I have information on Sønsteby,

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:05.666
Haugland, and Heiberg,

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:08.750
who I know you're very interested in."

01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:13.750
"I also don't want
to involve the regular police in this,

01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:15.291
as they cannot be trusted."

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:20.250
"If you could arrange
for a travel permit to Oslo,

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.083
then I would come immediately."

01:30:27.583 --> 01:30:31.625
"Most respectfully, Erling Solheim."

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:38.208
Can I speak with the two of you?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.416
Can I get a cup of tea?

01:30:45.208 --> 01:30:47.125
Look at this.

01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:52.000
From Rjukan.

01:30:53.208 --> 01:30:54.500
Do you know who he is?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.041
Take a Stapo car with you.

01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:02.083
Travel in civilian clothing.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.416
A certificate of service.

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:07.416
Solheim is currently out of work.

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.208
-He'll be living at this address here.
-Sam Eydes gate.

01:31:10.708 --> 01:31:13.125
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm. Thank him nicely for the letter.

01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:16.208
Then ask him to come
to Oslo to be interviewed.

01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:19.833
Tell him that Stapo is very grateful
that he has taken the trouble,

01:31:19.916 --> 01:31:23.500
and that the reward of 200,000
is waiting for him in Oslo.

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:24.833
200,000?

01:31:27.666 --> 01:31:29.291
That's probably why he's doing it.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:36.916
You take him out of town…

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.541
then shoot him.

Justice will be served.

01:37:41.958 --> 01:37:44.750
The despicable handful of traitors

01:37:44.833 --> 01:37:47.125
who betrayed their own countrymen…

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:05.333
Mr. Quisling, this is Halvor Rivrud.

01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:08.291
He was in Dachau and Mauthausen.

01:38:09.875 --> 01:38:11.541
I think you should listen to him.

01:38:12.375 --> 01:38:13.875
It'd be best to keep quiet.

01:39:25.166 --> 01:39:26.791
Thank you. Thank you.

01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:38.000
Hi.

01:39:39.708 --> 01:39:42.916
I was wondering if you could
sign this book for me?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.208
Yes, of course.

01:39:45.083 --> 01:39:45.958
Um…

01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:48.083
Gladly.

01:39:49.708 --> 01:39:51.333
Goodness gracious. Well.

01:39:52.666 --> 01:39:54.958
You're really interested
in all this, aren't you?

01:39:55.458 --> 01:39:56.500
Yes.

01:40:02.958 --> 01:40:03.833
Yes.

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:07.750
Well, I had hoped that you knew something
about my great-grandfather's brother.

01:40:09.208 --> 01:40:10.791
No, I'm sorry, dear.

01:40:12.833 --> 01:40:15.333
So much was happening
during that time, so…

01:40:18.041 --> 01:40:19.041
Yes.

01:40:21.166 --> 01:40:22.458
Forgive me.

01:40:26.625 --> 01:40:27.666
I understand.

01:40:32.458 --> 01:40:34.041
Thank you, nevertheless.

01:40:35.166 --> 01:40:36.166
Thank you.

01:41:04.916 --> 01:41:07.500
I have five drawers in my head.

01:41:09.583 --> 01:41:11.958
The three top drawers I open all the time.

01:41:13.625 --> 01:41:16.708
Drawer number four I open less often.

01:41:17.958 --> 01:41:22.666
I closed the bottom drawer
on May the 8th, 1945,

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.125
and I haven't opened it since.

01:41:27.875 --> 01:41:30.833
That's how I've managed all these years.

01:41:32.958 --> 01:41:35.250
It went well
for a surprising number of us.

01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:40.958
COMPANY LINGE
REUNION 1949

01:41:41.041 --> 01:41:43.791
But for some,
it got to be too much.

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:50.000
Andreas started drinking
on liberation day.

01:41:50.625 --> 01:41:52.291
Everyone knew who he was.

01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:55.500
No bar in Oslo would take his money,

01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:59.041
and for 12 years, he went from bar to bar.

01:42:00.916 --> 01:42:03.750
Andreas shot himself in 1965.

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.458
Yes, I sensed he wasn't doing well,

01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:11.208
but I didn't realise
at the time how bad it was.

01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:16.833
And it has troubled me for 50 years.

01:42:19.708 --> 01:42:22.125
The first time
I met Gunnar was in 1998…

01:43:33.458 --> 01:43:36.416
GUNNAR SØNSTEBY
WAS NEVER ARRESTED BY THE GERMANS.

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.250
HE CONDUCTED MORE THAN
20 SABOTAGE MISSIONS DURING THE WAR.

01:43:39.333 --> 01:43:41.333
HE IS THE HIGHEST DECORATED
NORWEGIAN CITIZEN

01:43:41.416 --> 01:43:44.125
AND THE ONLY ONE TO RECEIVE
THE WAR CROSS WITH THREE SWORDS.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.375
GUNNAR MARRIED
HIS BELOVED ANNE-KARIN IN 1953.

01:43:51.833 --> 01:43:54.583
DESPITE HIS FAILING HEALTH,
HE ENGAGED IN EXTENSIVE LECTURING

01:43:54.666 --> 01:43:56.333
UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH.

01:43:56.416 --> 01:43:59.250
HE SPENT 70 YEARS OF HIS LIFE
HELPING THOSE WHO STRUGGLED

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.625
