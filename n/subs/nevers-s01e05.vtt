WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.417
HORATIO COUSENS: It's not fun...

00:03.208 --> 00:04.959
watching you throw yourself
at danger

00:05.041 --> 00:06.375
like you think
it's gonna propose.

00:06.917 --> 00:08.583
Coming here to patch you up

00:08.834 --> 00:10.792
-over and over.
-Could be fun.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.417
I was left here
completely alone

00:16.125 --> 00:18.250
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given,

00:18.333 --> 00:19.959
no orders, no objectives.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.417
The heart of our empire
brought to a shuddering halt.

00:23.875 --> 00:27.917
The blade is in. We need to know
whose hand is on the hilt.

00:28.625 --> 00:31.333
Do you think that
I had something to do
with your friend's death?

00:31.417 --> 00:33.542
Did you? It would save me
such a lot of time.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.000
I hope he told you what happens
to spies during war time.

00:37.583 --> 00:40.000
A few days ago,
dark as the day we found it.

00:40.750 --> 00:41.834
And now...

00:42.667 --> 00:44.166
MALADIE: They say I killed Mary.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.667
I never did it.
I only kill angels.

00:49.834 --> 00:52.709
Justice! She gets justice
from us!

00:53.166 --> 00:55.083
Myrtle understood Mary's song.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.875
-She said,
"Come below and find me."
-(SOBS)

00:59.291 --> 01:00.709
PRIMROSE CHATTOWAY:
Who do we need to find?

01:10.417 --> 01:12.500
(shovels clacking)

01:14.875 --> 01:19.041
♪

01:30.375 --> 01:32.959
(rumbling)

01:33.041 --> 01:34.667
(sudden snap)

01:34.750 --> 01:37.750
(heavy breathing)

01:38.959 --> 01:40.917
(soft moaning)

01:48.709 --> 01:50.500
(kissing)

02:09.208 --> 02:11.709
-(Amalia moans)
-Judge: After five weeks...

02:11.792 --> 02:14.667
five grueling weeks
of testimony

02:14.750 --> 02:18.792
as to your heinous
and unrepentant malfeasance...

02:18.875 --> 02:22.083
-(Amalia moans)
-this court finds you guilty

02:22.166 --> 02:24.083
of the crimes of burglary,

02:24.166 --> 02:27.000
-theft, assault...
-(passionate moaning)

02:27.083 --> 02:31.041
extortion, indecency,
kidnapping,

02:31.125 --> 02:34.208
and 15 counts of murder.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.083
Désirée:
You're clear.

02:36.166 --> 02:40.583
Judge:
The court therefore
sentences you, Maladie,

02:40.667 --> 02:44.125
to be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.500
Sentence to be carried out
in the public square.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.625
(gasps, indistinct chatter)

02:51.709 --> 02:54.750
So that all who wish
may see the punishment

02:54.834 --> 02:56.458
for such wickedness,

02:56.542 --> 02:59.583
and the end of
your reign of terror.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.625
May God,

03:02.709 --> 03:06.291
assuming He ever
gave you one,

03:06.375 --> 03:08.542
have mercy on your soul.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.834
(giggles)

03:10.917 --> 03:12.792
(thuds)

03:12.875 --> 03:15.417
(shovels clacking)

03:16.458 --> 03:18.792
(rumbling)

03:31.417 --> 03:33.166
(birds cawing)

03:33.250 --> 03:35.250
A public execution?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.583
A travesty we abolished
30 years ago.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.083
A necessity.
All of London is watching.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.625
-The world is watching.
-Yes.

03:43.709 --> 03:45.583
As we turn savage.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.917
Turn into Darwin's
ancestral apes.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
My cousin,
His Majesty, the king--

03:51.083 --> 03:53.750
Oh, yes,
please remind us again
who your cousin is,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.250
because we wake
each dawn having forgot.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.500
We are not apes, Your Grace.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.375
We are managing a crisis.

04:00.458 --> 04:03.166
The Certification Act,
the Blue Badge Act.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.917
We keep the Touched
accountable, visible.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.125
-The woman is chained
like an animal.
-She's not in pain,

04:09.208 --> 04:11.125
and that's the point.

04:11.208 --> 04:14.125
Pain gives her power
she could use to escape.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.375
And not allowed to wash,
or change.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.792
Does she gain power
from that, hmm?

04:19.875 --> 04:21.375
Or are we violating--

04:21.458 --> 04:23.500
Maladie hangs as Maladie.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.166
Not some anonymous prisoner.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.792
This is a case where
justice must be seen.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.208
Lord Allaven-Tyne:
There is a legitimate concern,

04:31.291 --> 04:32.917
and it's not just
the Prime Minister,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.917
about enflaming the Touched.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.709
A minimal risk,
at worst.

04:37.792 --> 04:41.333
I have ordered troops
deployed around the square,

04:41.417 --> 04:43.875
and any potential
targets in the city.

04:43.959 --> 04:46.834
But no marching,
dress uniforms,
or bayonets.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.583
Well, except around the palace.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.709
The queen will have
her pageantry.

04:50.792 --> 04:54.166
But nothing resembling
martial law.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.250
We must keep control,
not seem to be grasping for it.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.000
I'm not talking about
some rabble

04:59.083 --> 05:01.166
hurling brickbats at patrolmen.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.667
It's the long-term.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.792
We showed our hand
siccing that ghastly
gunman Kroos

05:06.875 --> 05:09.333
on Mary Brighton, and for what?

05:09.417 --> 05:11.959
Within a week,
The Orphanage had
doubled its roster.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.583
If Kroos hadn't
silenced Brighton,

05:14.667 --> 05:16.542
it might've increased tenfold.

05:16.625 --> 05:20.250
And Maladie's not some
fetching chorus girl.
She's a pariah.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.166
Maladie's hanging will cause
a brouhaha, we all know,

05:24.250 --> 05:28.166
-but it is in
the long-term that--
-Prince Albrecht: Gentlemen.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.875
We took a vow to
protect the Empire,

05:30.959 --> 05:33.083
not to kill for sport.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.917
We've learned nothing
of the origin of the illness,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.208
or the creator of these...

05:39.291 --> 05:40.709
horrors.

05:40.792 --> 05:44.208
You ignore my reports
on the menace of electricity,

05:44.291 --> 05:46.166
-and then when I am absent...
-(glass clinking)

05:46.250 --> 05:49.166
I think, Prince Albrecht,
there was some concern

05:49.250 --> 05:51.875
as to the nature
of your absence.

05:51.959 --> 05:54.625
Massen:
About your sympathies

05:54.709 --> 05:56.458
with regard to the Touched.

05:56.542 --> 06:00.709
In particular,
why the princess was, uh,

06:00.792 --> 06:03.291
bundled off to Zurich
in the dead of night.

06:03.375 --> 06:07.291
Bettina has lumbago!

06:10.667 --> 06:14.125
And we wish her
a speedy recovery.

06:14.208 --> 06:18.917
But our patient is,
as you say, the Empire.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.250
(inhales)
And it requires a bloodletting.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.625
Lord Allaven-Tyne:
You know that won't be enough.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.208
Not for a lasting peace.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.709
-Amalia: X-ray.
-Penance: Spectralacle.

06:35.792 --> 06:37.458
You X-rayed London.

06:37.542 --> 06:40.041
It's a spectral-acle.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.583
Because it can see
through the-- but, yes.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.542
The square bits are
where we'll need to drill.

06:45.625 --> 06:46.917
The rest should be open air.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.417
Be easier to go
straight down.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.208
Not if we want
to come back up.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.792
The Galanthi's right under
Grand Abbey,

06:52.875 --> 06:55.458
and Nimble says
it's covered in thugs.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.166
Amalia:
But we still don't know whose.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.166
We'll find that out
on our reconnaissance.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.625
I've studied the angles,
and this is the best place
to get in.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.333
So what's this?

07:05.375 --> 07:08.417
The Royal Military Army.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.792
-Which is better?
-Not usually.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.792
But we do have an opportunity.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.750
Which is?

07:17.208 --> 07:20.291
This is the part
I don't like so well.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.709
Horatio:
Maladie's hanging?

07:21.792 --> 07:24.125
The whole place
will be dark for the day.

07:24.208 --> 07:27.208
Augie has a friend from school
who says everyone's
being deployed.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.750
-Hmm.
-Grand Parliament.
Buckingham Palace.

07:29.834 --> 07:33.208
-Are they expecting a rebellion?
-Maybe.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.792
(kisses)

07:35.875 --> 07:38.083
Are you planning a rebellion?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.375
A reunion.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.792
-You're afraid.
-I'm not.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.208
You're afraid to go see
the Galanthi.

07:48.291 --> 07:52.000
Yes. Yes, of course I am.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.500
(moans)

07:53.583 --> 07:56.834
Nothing's happened
the way it should've. I--

07:56.917 --> 07:59.500
What if I-- Stop that.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.625
No, don't stop.
You're a bad person.

08:02.709 --> 08:05.625
(moans) Oh. Uh-huh.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.333
What if that's because...

08:07.417 --> 08:10.625
Uh-huh...
What if it's because of me?

08:10.709 --> 08:13.333
What if it sees
what a horror I've been?

08:13.417 --> 08:15.458
-(pants)
-(whispers): I think that
every night.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.375
Don't bring up Katherine.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.583
Okay. It's... It's gonna...

08:20.667 --> 08:22.500
It's gonna work, all right?

08:22.583 --> 08:24.959
It's...
It's gonna be worth it.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.166
It'll heal us. All right?

08:32.458 --> 08:35.125
Heal us. Us.

08:35.208 --> 08:38.834
-Heal this.
-(stammers)
I, I don't know. I...

08:38.917 --> 08:42.333
-They're murdering women,
but this is a sin.
-Just...

08:42.417 --> 08:44.500
-Just...
-(sighs)

08:56.542 --> 08:58.792
(Horatio groans)

08:58.875 --> 09:00.375
(shovels clacking)

09:03.500 --> 09:05.250
It's hatching.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.458
No, uh, more chrysalis than egg.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.917
Speaking loosely,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
it's moving from
a liquid state to--

09:12.083 --> 09:13.375
goggles!

09:15.166 --> 09:17.625
(clicking)

09:17.709 --> 09:19.458
We're keeping exact
track of the pulses.

09:19.542 --> 09:23.750
-They're dimmer, but...
-Lavinia: Kill it.

09:23.834 --> 09:26.333
-Dr. Hague: Ma'am?
-It has a crack in it.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.750
Kill it!

09:27.834 --> 09:29.667
If it can crack,
it can break.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.625
No, it cracked.
I didn't crack it.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.458
I-- and I still can't.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.125
We have the bunker ready.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.291
Another week of digging,
and we can lay the tracks.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.583
This thing will be
miles away from the city

09:39.667 --> 09:42.125
-when it emerges--
-Our hopes for a cure
were childish.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.625
Its power grows by the day.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.792
There's a fever
spreading through London.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.750
Do you forget we're on the eve
of a public execution?

09:50.834 --> 09:52.792
You think that's coincidence?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.875
I think it's justice.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.208
(distant thudding)

10:02.041 --> 10:05.250
When we hang someone
in America...

10:05.333 --> 10:07.417
we watch.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.000
(sighs)

10:13.542 --> 10:15.166
F-forgive me.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.041
Maladie killed great men
of my profession.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.667
Friends.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.875
I may seem all numbers, but...

10:23.959 --> 10:26.875
-(creaking)
-(energy pulsing)

10:33.000 --> 10:34.583
I am still a man.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.542
I am still capable of rage.

10:37.625 --> 10:42.417
Of pettiness, and hope.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.250
The two of us have been
more exposed down here
than anyone,

10:46.333 --> 10:48.792
but your moral compass
hasn't fluttered.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.291
I'm still capable.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.458
Neither of us
has sprouted wings.

10:52.542 --> 10:56.166
This creature
isn't all-powerful.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.667
If Satan himself is in there,

10:59.750 --> 11:03.208
I doubt he's a match
for Lavinia Bidlow.

11:03.291 --> 11:06.083
We're taking a terrible risk.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.834
It means to destroy us.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.792
If we've lost hope...

11:17.625 --> 11:19.583
it already has.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.625
(exhales)

11:41.125 --> 11:44.041
(indistinct chatter)

11:51.834 --> 11:53.083
(children laughing)

11:53.166 --> 11:56.625
Woman:
(grunts) Ooh.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.625
-Oh! Oh...
-(slams)

11:58.709 --> 12:01.542
"And what of those
looking down from above,

12:01.625 --> 12:04.500
"jud-ging-- judging these women

12:04.583 --> 12:07.208
"without knowing where
their own jud-g-ment ends.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.417
"When He who sits above all

12:09.500 --> 12:12.333
"and yet looks down on no one
calls 'em to account,

12:12.417 --> 12:17.375
will they explain how
celebrating murder
was the righteous path?"

12:17.458 --> 12:19.291
She's terribly compelling.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.250
Ah, so you liked it?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.083
Telling all to Désirée.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.041
'Course you did.
You are so predictable.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.542
Hey, it's Mrs. True's orders.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.208
And talking to Désirée,
baring the soul,

12:30.291 --> 12:33.375
among other things,
it takes a weight off.

12:33.458 --> 12:34.625
Among other things.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.625
-(grunts)
-(thuds)

12:37.709 --> 12:39.792
And now everyone's comfortable
with me being here,

12:39.875 --> 12:43.125
except around the silver,
and trinkets, purses,
keepsakes...

12:43.208 --> 12:46.166
-(grunts)
-(energy pulsing)

12:47.000 --> 12:48.375
Annie:
Smug.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.583
Won't be this easy tomorrow.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.667
Can't skip away in a dark cave.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.417
Oh, I'm not skipping.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.041
Good. I don't want
to talk about it either.

12:57.125 --> 13:01.083
Go on, then. Go.
Everybody's glad you're going.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.583
She smiled because
you're going!

13:03.667 --> 13:05.792
Nimble:
Men.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.208
We truly are the unfairer sex.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.375
-(thudding)
-Aah.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.375
"When Maladie is swinging

13:13.458 --> 13:15.792
"in the sight of lords
and little girls,

13:15.875 --> 13:18.667
will that bring peace
to London?"

13:18.750 --> 13:20.917
I guess maybe the Galanthi will.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.500
Whatever they are.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.250
Well, not in time for her,
but...

13:25.333 --> 13:27.000
Is it even gonna work?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.333
Hanging Maladie.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.250
Mrs. True said she gets
stronger from pain, yeah?

13:31.333 --> 13:32.458
From pain.

13:32.542 --> 13:35.458
Not from damage.
Not from death.

13:36.458 --> 13:37.834
Read the end.

13:37.917 --> 13:42.041
"Maladie's hanging is more
than a barbaric spectacle.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.000
"It is a crack
in the soul of the city,

13:44.083 --> 13:48.125
"and who knows what venomous
vapors will billow from below,

13:48.208 --> 13:51.709
"infecting it with the oldest,
most animal rage,

13:51.792 --> 13:54.333
and making Maladies of us all."

13:54.417 --> 13:57.875
Well, I don't much like
the sound of that idea.

13:57.959 --> 14:00.250
There's no legal
argument for this.

14:00.333 --> 14:04.208
Look, the 1868 amendment
made executions private,

14:04.291 --> 14:06.542
only subject to change
in order to prevent abuse

14:06.625 --> 14:08.625
or to give greater
solemnity to the act.

14:08.709 --> 14:12.542
This will do the opposite,
and the government knows it.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.458
They're hanging Maladie
for being Touched.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.667
(footsteps departing)

14:23.458 --> 14:26.583
Name, address, employer.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.750
-And you've got your
letters of support?
-Yes.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.625
Clerk:
New Touched who are here
to register, get in this queue.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.333
-(sighs) Right.
-Clerk: You'll get
your turn soon enough.

14:35.417 --> 14:36.917
She wears this everywhere.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.625
If she's seen in public
without it,
that's jail for a month.

14:39.709 --> 14:43.000
Now, you wait over there
while she's in the
demonstration room.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.291
Demonstration?

14:44.375 --> 14:46.208
What-- what you
gonna demonstrate?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.792
It's ju-- It's just the ears.

14:47.875 --> 14:50.625
Nah, I've seen this one
in me henhouse last week.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.583
-Aw, don't worry, pet.
-(daughter gasps)

14:52.667 --> 14:54.834
We'll get out
the hounds and horses.
See how fast you can run.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.709
Frank:
I told you when
you first started

14:56.792 --> 14:58.166
nosing around here, Boyle,

14:58.250 --> 15:00.583
-you can't interview her.
-Five minutes.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.625
-She'd kill you in four.
-Three and a half minutes.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.750
Oh, come on, Mundi.
I need this.

15:05.834 --> 15:08.667
They need this.
All this registration nonsense,

15:08.750 --> 15:11.208
it's just a milder form of
what's going on with Maladie.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.083
Maladie--

15:14.875 --> 15:17.959
Maladie is the worst killer

15:18.041 --> 15:20.125
in London's history.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.709
The less she's heard from,

15:21.792 --> 15:23.959
the better chance
we've got of controlling

15:24.041 --> 15:25.792
this fucking circus.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.125
You don't want
this hanging either.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.125
No, I want order.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.750
I want the wicked punished
and the good protected.

15:32.834 --> 15:35.291
Then do something besides
sitting at your desk

15:35.375 --> 15:37.041
ogling the Touched women.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.458
I can't see the Touched women,

15:39.542 --> 15:41.166
and you can't see Maladie,

15:41.250 --> 15:43.458
'cause it helps nothing
except your sales.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.917
My sales matter.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.166
I'm the only one showing
the human side of the Touched.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.709
Mundi, people can print
whatever they want.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.333
I am still in favor
of the truth.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.750
-Who's this?
-Murder.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.583
Railmen tried to throw it
on Maladie's pile.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.959
With no ID, no one missing,
it fits the description.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.041
Effie: Well, they didn't
put much effort into
matching the writing.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.166
I have that coat.

16:08.250 --> 16:11.083
Or that style.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.750
It's popular with working women.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.500
It's a sharp cut,
and it's cheap.

16:14.583 --> 16:17.375
I'll wager she worked
in an office

16:17.458 --> 16:19.834
but was out a lot of the time.

16:19.917 --> 16:22.250
She was in the underground,
city council,

16:22.333 --> 16:27.041
a secretary, or a...
"secretary."

16:27.125 --> 16:30.166
You put a name on her,
I'll take you to Maladie myself.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.667
You mean it?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.959
I do not.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.208
After all that,
both the ostriches were females.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.000
(laughs)

16:43.083 --> 16:44.709
Well. Oh...

16:44.792 --> 16:47.375
-(gulps)
-(Lavinia whimpers)

16:47.458 --> 16:49.917
-Lavinia, are you all right?
-Oh, it's nothing.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.291
Slight ache behind the eyes.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.041
Oh.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.291
Did you buy that waistcoat
on your own?

16:56.375 --> 16:57.709
It looks like one of Swann's.

16:57.792 --> 17:01.000
No, I just...
I just thought...

17:01.083 --> 17:02.458
Hello.

17:02.542 --> 17:04.667
You need to steer clear
of him in future,

17:04.750 --> 17:06.417
and now that that
ghastly club of his

17:06.500 --> 17:09.166
has become a matter
of public record.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.542
He's my friend.
(clears throat)

17:11.625 --> 17:15.000
-(sighs)
-He was your friend, as well.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.542
Do you-- (laughs)

17:16.625 --> 17:20.417
Do you remember when you took us
ice skating with you?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.041
He made you laugh all day

17:22.125 --> 17:24.250
just pretending to be
an ice dancer.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.000
Yes, he was charming at 10.

17:28.959 --> 17:32.000
Augie, the devil may take
a pleasing form,

17:32.083 --> 17:35.500
but you trust people,
and I think...

17:37.208 --> 17:39.250
I...

17:39.333 --> 17:42.125
You know, you must call
Dr. Waterson about
those headaches.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.750
Or I'll tell Hugo that you think
he has a pleasing form,

17:45.834 --> 17:47.417
then you'll never hear
the end of it.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.250
-Stop it.
-Diner: They should hang her,

17:49.333 --> 17:51.166
and shoot her.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.834
Just to make sure.
(laughs)

17:52.917 --> 17:54.041
Woman:
How early are we going?

17:54.125 --> 17:56.542
Can we pay a boy
to hold a place in front?

17:56.625 --> 17:59.583
Why don't they just bring guns
and shoot her themselves?

17:59.667 --> 18:00.875
(gasps)

18:02.208 --> 18:04.083
We are not murderers, madam.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.875
No, you just like to watch.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.709
At least Maladie
has a work ethic.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.750
(whispering inaudibly)

18:13.834 --> 18:14.834
What are you saying?

18:14.917 --> 18:16.542
-Oh, noth-- noth--
-Don't apologize for me.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.750
How dare you?

18:17.834 --> 18:19.959
I'm not someone's dotty mother.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.000
There are vultures everywhere.

18:22.083 --> 18:26.208
Dressed up in hats
and fine silks.

18:28.375 --> 18:32.250
-(patrons muttering)
-(dishes clattering)

18:36.250 --> 18:39.375
(diners chattering softly)

18:41.417 --> 18:43.917
Yes, I was quite good
at skating.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.083
Rings around the rest of us.

18:57.208 --> 19:01.375
You know, that, that's something
that hasn't changed.

19:01.458 --> 19:04.166
You're not to be in the city
at all tomorrow, Augie.

19:04.250 --> 19:07.417
-Don't argue.
-No, no, of course, no.
I, um...

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
I'm going to Brighton
for the day.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.709
Uh, thank you.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.917
Um, a-- a building's opened up

19:13.000 --> 19:15.375
that might make a--
a good new bird sanctuary.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.458
There's been a lot of interest
from the public of late.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.125
Yes, the more barbaric
we humans are to each other,

19:20.208 --> 19:22.083
the more we pamper our pets.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.959
Or maybe the more we need them.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.959
Augie...

19:34.291 --> 19:38.875
Bring your sister
something fun back
from Brighton.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.667
Of course.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.875
One of the guards did say
Maladie sings.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.875
-Nursery rhymes and such.
-How insightful.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.709
Well, it's just, you know,

19:56.792 --> 19:59.083
it's all about
mental capacity, really.

19:59.166 --> 20:01.333
Hugo:
Are you fucking playing with me?

20:01.417 --> 20:03.792
He's pressing charges.
This is insane!

20:03.875 --> 20:06.083
Lord Humphries was badly burned.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.417
Bertie Humphries
is a bully and a coward,

20:08.500 --> 20:09.875
and he wasn't burned,
he was frozen.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.291
And he was frozen because
he will not hear the words,

20:12.375 --> 20:14.166
"Don't touch!"

20:15.667 --> 20:18.125
(sighs)
Ronald is a great act.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.333
He can chill your drinks.
You can see your breath,

20:20.417 --> 20:24.166
-but you grab it,
you're only going to--
-Ronald isn't registered.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.000
An unregistered Touched
can't contest a complaint.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.875
If his lordship pursues this,

20:28.959 --> 20:30.458
-you will--
-Injury waiver.

20:30.542 --> 20:33.709
You cannot apply for membership
to the Ferryman's without it.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.166
(sighs) Does Bertie
really want to go public?

20:39.250 --> 20:42.542
Because I am more than happy
to speak to Lady Humphries--

20:42.625 --> 20:44.041
Extortion is still illegal.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.625
This is not extortion.
It is umbrage.

20:46.709 --> 20:49.000
(exhales)

20:49.083 --> 20:53.625
(sighs) Oh, God.
Do you know how hard
I am working?

20:53.709 --> 20:57.291
(sighs) Dealing with
petty legalities

20:57.375 --> 20:59.083
and excruciating paperwork,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.792
and now some idiot
is wasting my time

21:01.875 --> 21:03.875
because he's got angry
with the Touched.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.250
Bugger. Of course you do.

21:09.333 --> 21:12.208
(sighs) What a strange fate.

21:12.291 --> 21:14.959
We've become men with offices.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.792
Frank:
Yeah.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.375
It's like looking in a mirror.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.208
How do I make this go away?

21:29.291 --> 21:31.834
Do you think my acts want
to be on a government list?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.875
They know how people
feel about them,

21:33.959 --> 21:35.917
even people who desire them.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.917
Especially people
who desire them.

21:41.083 --> 21:44.041
A "turn" is unique.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.166
It marks you,

21:46.250 --> 21:48.333
like a...

21:48.417 --> 21:50.417
Like a Sargent portrait.

21:50.500 --> 21:54.417
Or, um, oh, God,
what's that thing?
Fingerprints!

21:54.500 --> 21:58.542
Are really no two alike?
That seems mad. (chuckles)

21:58.625 --> 22:01.500
We have to register your man.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.667
I won't list his place
of employment,

22:03.750 --> 22:06.375
but you need to give
satisfaction to Lord Humphries,

22:06.458 --> 22:07.959
not threats.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.291
Send him a fucking horse,

22:11.375 --> 22:15.500
or whatever you rich people do,
and no more of these.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.834
If you can't keep
your people safe,

22:17.917 --> 22:19.875
I will shut you down.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.542
You ain't a man with an office.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.792
You're a pimp with a gimmick,
and you're playing with fire.

22:23.875 --> 22:27.583
-Again, it wasn't fire--
-It was someone's life!

22:29.583 --> 22:31.333
I don't know how you always...

22:31.417 --> 22:33.458
(breathing heavily)

22:37.125 --> 22:40.542
Tomorrow, we are
going to kill a woman

22:40.625 --> 22:42.709
for the public's entertainment.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.792
'Cause that's what
London is now. It is...

22:44.875 --> 22:47.792
Jack the fucking Ripper
grown into an 'ole city.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.208
You're in entertainment.
You should come.

22:50.291 --> 22:54.667
Get in the dirt,
smell the blood.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.375
Then you'll know
what's on your hands.

23:00.667 --> 23:03.458
Frank, why did you take
a job you hate?

23:04.667 --> 23:07.333
'Cause I work with
the people who love it.

23:10.709 --> 23:13.333
-Effie: Oh. Excuse me.
-...do know a bit about your...

23:15.041 --> 23:17.250
Had your ear to the door,
I hope?

23:17.333 --> 23:19.041
Oh, I didn't need to.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.000
You're Hugo Swann.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.583
You don't write
about the Touched

23:22.667 --> 23:26.542
and not hear about London's
most infamous impresario.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.417
(inhales)
I deny everything.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.542
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not after your story.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.125
But you are after something.

23:34.208 --> 23:37.000
Something you can't get me.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.166
Mmm...

23:39.250 --> 23:41.792
So it's a challenge, is it?

23:41.875 --> 23:43.625
You'd like that.

23:43.709 --> 23:47.917
I'd like it more over a plate
of oysters at Pegini's.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.750
We're both much too busy
to spend the afternoon

23:50.834 --> 23:52.792
seeing who gets to use who,

23:52.875 --> 23:55.417
but there is something
you can do for me.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.750
(murmurs)

24:01.709 --> 24:05.375
♪

24:07.542 --> 24:09.041
(water running)

24:09.959 --> 24:12.083
(birds chirping)

24:16.875 --> 24:18.250
(faucet squeaks off)

24:24.583 --> 24:26.375
(door opens)

24:34.417 --> 24:36.709
(birds chirping)

24:39.083 --> 24:40.792
(chirping continues)

24:40.875 --> 24:42.625
(chuckles softly)

24:46.250 --> 24:47.959
(chirping continues)

24:58.417 --> 25:00.291
(chirping continues)

25:01.291 --> 25:02.709
-Augie?
-Yes?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.792
-(gasps, screams)
-(yells) Go!

25:06.041 --> 25:07.542
-Oh...
-Were you a crow?

25:07.625 --> 25:11.625
-What?
-Up there, were you peering
at me by way of bird?

25:11.709 --> 25:14.709
Oh! Oh, G--
No, good God, no-no.

25:14.792 --> 25:16.667
No, no, I--
I was-- I was me.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.709
I was me, in, in... in me.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.792
I don't-- I don't mean--
I came, I came for the meeting.

25:20.875 --> 25:24.208
-So I would-- I would never!
-Wouldn't you?

25:24.291 --> 25:28.125
-That bird seemed awful
keen on my ablutions.
-Well, I...

25:28.959 --> 25:30.458
I mean, it's--

25:32.125 --> 25:34.208
It's a-- It's a bird.
(laughs)

25:34.291 --> 25:36.208
I-I didn't even know
you were bathing,

25:36.291 --> 25:39.000
and that-that-that
that was a redwing,
anyway.

25:39.083 --> 25:42.125
They never listen to a word,
I think.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.250
Am I being recorded again?

25:44.333 --> 25:46.125
Of course not.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.375
I s-should make more noise
when I come in.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.417
No, it's just, um...

25:51.500 --> 25:53.917
the madness of all this.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.583
It's as though sin is in bloom.

25:56.667 --> 26:00.834
People doing what they oughtn't,
or doing nothing.

26:01.834 --> 26:04.291
It's like we're being tested,

26:04.375 --> 26:06.583
but it's that dream
where the test's over,

26:06.667 --> 26:09.583
and you've not
found your pencils.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.583
But you're telling me
the truth?

26:11.667 --> 26:14.166
I would never betray your trust.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.875
Wouldn't sneak a quick glance
at what a husband's
meant to see?

26:16.959 --> 26:20.458
-Never.
-Well, is my naked frame
a source of dullness then?

26:20.542 --> 26:22.417
(footsteps approaching)

26:22.500 --> 26:24.959
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes, please!

26:25.041 --> 26:28.083
I've got the drill all ready.
Let me show you.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.041
Augie, how's the bird watching?

26:33.125 --> 26:36.625
-I...
-You ready to make them
sing tomorrow?

26:36.709 --> 26:39.083
Oh. Oh, yes, yes.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.250
(clears throat)
They'll make
all sorts of noise.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.458
They'll swoop about.
I've been practicing.

26:43.542 --> 26:46.083
Be the perfect distraction
for the drilling.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.959
What do you, um,

26:48.041 --> 26:50.500
what do you think
you'll find down there?

26:50.583 --> 26:53.458
If-if-if it's all right
for me to ask.

26:53.542 --> 26:56.458
Um, I'm not sure what I'm--
what level of...

26:56.542 --> 27:00.083
I-I know it's Galanthi,
uh, even in the singular.

27:00.166 --> 27:03.250
The timing on
the explosive bolts
was the issue, but now...

27:03.333 --> 27:05.834
-(clicks)
-(whirring)

27:05.917 --> 27:08.417
We'll find answers.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.333
Is it safe,
who's down there with it?

27:11.417 --> 27:13.667
What do we need
to get it away from them?

27:13.750 --> 27:17.917
There's more,
but can I just say hope?

27:20.083 --> 27:22.208
You could have only said that.

27:24.583 --> 27:27.083
(loud drilling)

27:30.208 --> 27:32.417
And when you reach
the proper depth, you just...

27:36.208 --> 27:37.750
Oh...

27:39.291 --> 27:41.625
Uh... uh...

27:41.709 --> 27:43.750
(whirring, clacking)

27:43.834 --> 27:46.542
Uh, that--
that'd be the floor that it--

27:46.625 --> 27:48.583
(swishing)

27:50.917 --> 27:53.125
Yeah, that's not coming back.

27:54.959 --> 27:56.750
No? Mmm...

28:05.291 --> 28:06.834
Man:
Keep it movin'.

28:06.917 --> 28:09.458
Maladie hangs tomorrow.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.125
(clatters)

28:30.500 --> 28:33.583
You mustn't rush, my sprouts.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.750
It ain't a hangin'
if she don't swing.

28:36.834 --> 28:38.417
(chuckles)

28:38.500 --> 28:40.166
Chop chop!

28:46.333 --> 28:48.333
Bring him 'round the back.

28:49.542 --> 28:51.375
Slow and steady.

28:51.458 --> 28:53.333
You's got all night.

29:00.834 --> 29:02.709
Gilbert Massen.

29:02.792 --> 29:05.709
Captain of industry,
Peer of the Realm.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.625
Am I meant to call you "lord"?

29:07.709 --> 29:09.625
Am I meant to call you "king"?

29:09.709 --> 29:11.834
This machine's impressive.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.500
Penance Adair's work, I think.

29:15.458 --> 29:18.792
Yeah. It's fun.

29:18.875 --> 29:21.458
-I let the kids tool
about the yard in it.
-(liquid pouring)

29:21.542 --> 29:23.792
-Not very practical, though.
-(glass clatters)

29:23.875 --> 29:25.792
If I ever crash,
I like a nice fat horse

29:25.875 --> 29:27.333
in front of me
to take the brunt.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.792
What the fuck do you want?

29:28.875 --> 29:31.041
I want London under control.

29:31.125 --> 29:34.625
-Meaning yours.
-Meaning not overrun
by monsters.

29:34.709 --> 29:37.125
Monsters, yeah?
Well, Maladie
stretches tomorrow.

29:37.208 --> 29:41.125
While Bonfire Annie
is free to set fire
to both our holdings,

29:41.208 --> 29:44.041
while an uneducated Irish girl

29:44.125 --> 29:46.792
builds something in days
that men of industry

29:46.875 --> 29:49.333
have labored over for years.

29:49.417 --> 29:51.250
A thing that threatens
the natural order

29:51.333 --> 29:53.625
is by definition monstrous,

29:53.709 --> 29:55.417
even if it's pretty.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.333
There's nothing natural
about order, Gilly.

29:58.417 --> 30:01.917
There's chaos. Savagery.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.083
And then there's men like us,

30:04.166 --> 30:05.709
who carve out just enough order

30:05.792 --> 30:08.333
to make ourselves
absolutely necessary.

30:08.417 --> 30:09.959
You didn't come here

30:10.041 --> 30:12.834
'cause you're afraid
of the pretty ladies.

30:12.917 --> 30:15.208
You just get ugly men
to murder 'em.

30:15.291 --> 30:18.125
-Isn't that right, Odium?
-(door bangs open)

30:18.208 --> 30:21.542
-(growls, grunts)
-(clattering)

30:21.625 --> 30:24.333
My man Odium was sent
to kill Amalia True.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.250
Thought it was an order
sent down from me,

30:26.333 --> 30:28.792
which the law would've
happily confirmed.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.959
Now you look me in the eye,

30:31.041 --> 30:32.625
hand on heart,

30:32.709 --> 30:35.583
and you tell me that
this man is not ugly.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.500
I see only a soldier

30:40.583 --> 30:44.333
who was laid out by a woman
one-fifth his fighting weight.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.500
-(footsteps departing)
-We have a common enemy.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.583
Someone, some group,

30:52.667 --> 30:55.250
is rewriting
the rules of reality.

30:55.333 --> 30:56.959
If we don't find
a way to control it--

30:57.041 --> 30:59.250
You know why they call me
the Beggar King?

30:59.333 --> 31:01.667
Hmm? 'Cause I had fuck-all,

31:01.750 --> 31:03.583
and men followed me anyway.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.542
The Touched are gonna
change things.

31:05.625 --> 31:08.625
So did the fucking longbow.
I'll adapt.

31:10.625 --> 31:15.625
I'm not looking
for an ally, Mr. Orrun.

31:15.709 --> 31:18.542
I have a job.
It pays obscenely well.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.000
Now was that so
fuckin' hard to say?

31:28.709 --> 31:32.917
We have looked for the source
of all this, for a cure.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.500
We've taken steps to...

31:35.583 --> 31:39.500
But we're behind,
reacting when we should act.

31:39.583 --> 31:43.417
Maladie's hanging presents
an opportunity to change that.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.834
To be ready.

31:44.917 --> 31:48.000
Be ready? You expecting
some kind of daring escape?

31:48.083 --> 31:51.083
No, Maladie hangs.
Justice will be seen.

31:51.166 --> 31:53.458
But in the short run,
it will stir up emotions

31:53.542 --> 31:55.125
as much as it placates.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.041
The Touched, the Purists,

31:57.125 --> 32:00.041
their defiance
is at a fever pitch.

32:00.125 --> 32:02.166
Right, and you want my men
to keep the peace.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.166
Maintain the natural order,
as it were?

32:04.250 --> 32:06.792
As far as my people know, yes.

32:06.875 --> 32:10.083
But, uh, it's become
apparent to me

32:10.166 --> 32:15.959
that if London is going
to be saved from chaos,

32:16.041 --> 32:19.375
it needs to see chaos.

32:19.458 --> 32:24.500
What I want from you
is just enough.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.792
(slow breathing)

32:30.875 --> 32:32.875
(soft sighing)

32:34.542 --> 32:37.500
(door squeaks closed)

32:37.583 --> 32:40.667
-Are you heading up?
-I have to finish
rebuilding the drill.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.166
-How are the girls?
-Mmm, a bit jittery.

32:43.250 --> 32:46.542
Except for Myrtle,
who's angry she
doesn't get to go.

32:46.625 --> 32:49.458
I'm pretty sure that's
what she was angry about.

32:49.542 --> 32:51.625
She has to get on with
her writin' lessons.

32:51.709 --> 32:53.667
I would take her
if I knew it was safe.

32:53.750 --> 32:56.125
She speaks Galanthi.

32:56.208 --> 33:00.291
A couple of the girls
were saying you killed Lucy.

33:00.375 --> 33:04.166
Annie shut them down,
but she's a bit
frightening herself.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.709
But you know I didn't.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.125
Oh, of course not.
No, you would never.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.667
No, I would.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.500
I wanted to.
That's how you know I didn't.

33:12.583 --> 33:14.917
And yes, I miss Lucy, too.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.250
I wonder if Mary does.

33:16.333 --> 33:18.458
-No, I'm not saying that--
-They're either with us, or--

33:18.542 --> 33:20.792
Well, what about forgiveness?

33:20.875 --> 33:23.875
I mean, forgiveness still exists
in the world, doesn't it?

33:23.959 --> 33:26.417
Or did we come up with a cure?

33:26.500 --> 33:30.166
Was kindness just
germs all along?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.542
This time tomorrow,

33:33.625 --> 33:35.375
-I promise you won't be worried.
-It's just, I always--

33:35.458 --> 33:37.959
I always say that
I won't make weapons.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.291
But most of my gimcracks,

33:39.375 --> 33:41.959
they could kill someone
in the wrong circumstances.

33:42.041 --> 33:44.500
So could a candlestick.
A pail of water.

33:44.583 --> 33:46.917
They're violent things,
my engines.

33:48.166 --> 33:53.667
Sometimes energy itself,
it just seems... relentless.

33:53.750 --> 33:58.000
Penance, the Galanthi
will know your heart...

33:58.083 --> 33:59.750
-the way I know--
-(loud banging)

33:59.834 --> 34:02.500
-(laughter)
-(running footsteps)

34:08.834 --> 34:11.083
(breathing heavily)

34:11.166 --> 34:13.333
(ropes squeaking)

34:17.834 --> 34:20.500
(ominous music playing)

34:25.625 --> 34:27.834
I need to finish the drill.

35:32.458 --> 35:36.375
-How did you sleep?
-Standing up, with my eyes open.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.834
And working. I didn't sleep.

35:39.917 --> 35:43.709
-What am I seeing?
-This is how we do it.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.417
Amalia:
How we do... what?

35:48.917 --> 35:52.166
This is how we save Maladie.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.250
I know the Galanthi
is the key to our hopes,

35:54.333 --> 35:56.667
and it needs us to come for it
as soon as we can, but--

35:56.750 --> 35:59.667
But Maladie is going to be
murdered this day out in public,

35:59.750 --> 36:02.208
and I can't let it happen.
I know I'm not meant to.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.583
I've seen it done once,

36:03.667 --> 36:05.166
and if I have
the power to stop it,

36:05.250 --> 36:07.709
then that is the reason
I have power at all.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.709
Maladie is not Mary.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.959
She tried to kill Mary, and you.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.125
-I'm not saying she--
-She murdered a dozen people,

36:14.208 --> 36:16.291
also in public. Remember that?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.875
This is the legal execution
of a genuine threat

36:18.959 --> 36:21.917
-who is also violently unhappy.
-So it's a mercy killin'.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.458
Sometimes it's a mercy.

36:23.542 --> 36:24.625
But this time it's a lynching.

36:24.709 --> 36:26.834
For them to crow at,
and for us to expect.

36:26.917 --> 36:31.375
It's a noose in a row of nooses
next to a row of nooses.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.166
You expect me to turn
my back on the only power

36:34.250 --> 36:35.333
that can make all of this right

36:35.417 --> 36:37.834
that told me a month ago
it needs me

36:37.917 --> 36:39.375
so that we can prove
to the public

36:39.458 --> 36:42.000
we're all in league
with a psychotic killer?

36:42.083 --> 36:44.417
How is that--
that's all the nooses.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.542
That's putting
the Touched at risk

36:46.625 --> 36:49.166
much more than letting
a crowd foam over one--

36:49.250 --> 36:52.208
I know you're not comin', True.

36:52.291 --> 36:54.959
-I'd feel better
if you did, but...
-(sighs)

36:55.834 --> 36:57.542
I can't let you do it.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.625
-Oh, let's please not go
down that road.
-If you get hurt,

36:59.709 --> 37:01.333
-and you will get hurt--
-Oh, yes, 'cause I know,

37:01.417 --> 37:03.542
I'm a child.
I've not been in battle.

37:03.625 --> 37:06.000
I've not killed and eaten
a dozen fierce men.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.750
I also haven't.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.166
But I am in the world.

37:10.250 --> 37:11.917
I am a part of God's world.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.041
And I don't believe He means
for us to go backwards,

37:14.125 --> 37:16.458
killin' each other for sport.

37:16.542 --> 37:20.083
Amalia:
We'll go save a dozen
people tomorrow. Children.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.208
That's not the point.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.834
Kittens?

37:26.417 --> 37:29.125
It's her. It's now.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.792
Something inside me broke.

37:30.875 --> 37:34.417
It, it, it snapped like a rib,
True, and it hurts.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.959
I will not live with the thought
that I ignored that s-sign.

37:39.041 --> 37:41.625
So God is telling you
to save Maladie.

37:41.709 --> 37:44.208
No. Is He telling you
to abandon her?

37:44.291 --> 37:47.375
Would your Galanthi
look kindly on that?

37:47.458 --> 37:49.333
And could it not heal Sarah?

37:49.417 --> 37:50.667
Make her who she was before?

37:50.750 --> 37:53.291
Have you-- have you never
even wondered on that?

37:53.375 --> 37:55.291
There are things
you can't come back from.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.834
That's a theory you're
awful anxious not to test.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.458
So this is about
what I did to Sarah.

38:01.542 --> 38:02.792
It's about the girls.

38:02.875 --> 38:05.709
All of them,
in here and all out there.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.917
(muffled yelling):
Not just their safety.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.125
It's about how
they see the world.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.625
A part of them breaks
or goes quiet for always

38:12.709 --> 38:14.166
when the world turns beastly.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.041
When we just let it.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.834
You're not bringing her here.

38:24.917 --> 38:27.625
I mean, after many,
many people shoot you,

38:27.709 --> 38:29.667
and Maladie stabs you
because it's funny,

38:29.750 --> 38:31.500
she doesn't set a foot
in this place.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.542
I said I had a plan.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.291
Look, True,
I know it'll be harder

38:38.375 --> 38:40.125
in a few days
with more people around,

38:40.208 --> 38:42.166
-but the Galanthi is still...
-No, I'm-- what?

38:42.250 --> 38:44.875
I'm going. Today.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.667
I'm going.

38:46.750 --> 38:50.208
I've got my drill, my breathers.
You've done your part.

38:50.291 --> 38:53.458
I'm sorry, did your plan
not get as far as this?

38:53.542 --> 38:56.333
Did you not see
my potential energy

38:56.417 --> 38:58.875
potentially doing
the fucking job?

38:58.959 --> 39:01.375
-But...
-I'm not turning my back
on the Galanthi

39:01.458 --> 39:04.542
-because you got a fucking
pain the ribs.
-(clattering)

39:04.625 --> 39:07.041
The future of the world
depends on what I'm doing.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.625
The future of the world
depends on the present.

39:09.709 --> 39:11.500
Isn't that why you're here?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.583
(sighs)

39:15.250 --> 39:16.750
I don't know why I'm here.

39:16.834 --> 39:21.291
I don't know how it got this far
or what I'm doing next.

39:22.125 --> 39:23.750
I know what I'm not doing.

39:23.834 --> 39:26.625
I'm not mistaking
my pain for an idea.

39:27.959 --> 39:31.041

I should lead.

-All right, everybody,
gather around,

39:40.917 --> 39:42.125
If you weren't listening in,

39:42.208 --> 39:44.750
Miss Adair and I have come
to a bit of a crossroads.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.333
I am leaving in a few minutes

39:46.417 --> 39:48.166
to find the Galanthi,
as we've planned.

39:48.250 --> 39:51.083
I know I've been vague
about what that means,

39:51.166 --> 39:53.375
but it's the first step
to learning

39:53.458 --> 39:55.041
why we were
brought here together,

39:55.125 --> 39:57.375
and what we're meant to do next.

40:00.291 --> 40:03.500
(quietly):
And I'm going to Maladie
to save...

40:07.250 --> 40:09.792
I'm going to the square
to stop that hanging.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.500
I'm going to save Maladie.

40:12.583 --> 40:14.375
That's mad, right?

40:14.458 --> 40:17.333
Acting like she's still
a child of God.
Well, we all are.

40:17.417 --> 40:20.458
We all have a soul,
no matter what viciousness
people are spewing.

40:20.542 --> 40:23.834
I am going to pluck Maladie
right from out their
bigoted claws,

and let the world see
that the Touched are not here
to be slaughtered for show.

and I feel sweaty!

40:32.750 --> 40:34.083
Amalia:
All right.

40:34.166 --> 40:36.125
We had a plan.
Now there are two.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.166
I can't compel anyone
to stay with me,

40:38.250 --> 40:41.875

Don't do that.

we were gonna shoot

1:02:48.458 --> 1:02:52.083
in a very historic part
of London called Greenwich.

1:02:52.166 --> 1:02:54.500
It was just a grand,
grand space.

1:02:54.709 --> 1:02:57.875
But, during these COVID times,
we just said, "You know what?

1:02:58.083 --> 1:03:00.333
What if we just built
our own town square?"

1:03:02.750 --> 1:03:04.542
GEMMA JACKSON: I'm so
pleased that we got to build it

1:03:04.625 --> 1:03:06.542
because with COVID
and everything

1:03:06.625 --> 1:03:09.250
and not having so many extras...

1:03:09.333 --> 1:03:11.500
It's not as big as Greenwich,
which is good,

1:03:11.583 --> 1:03:14.583
and it's got a lot more,
sort of, ins and outs to it.

1:03:14.667 --> 1:03:16.583
We created the back of a prison

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:19.542

It just has that lovely,
Victorian griminess about it,

1:03:28.041 --> 1:03:30.709
which inspired everything
that we're putting in there.

1:03:30.792 --> 1:03:34.583
We sort of do research into
what they would've eaten then.

1:03:34.917 --> 1:03:36.500
So an event like this...

1:03:36.583 --> 1:03:40.083
toffee apples,
oysters, jellied eels.

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:44.166
So those are the sort of things
that the poor extras are eating.

1:03:44.625 --> 1:03:46.417

1:03:46.750 --> 1:03:48.709
Even down to things
that probably

1:03:48.792 --> 1:03:51.500
the camera won't pick up,
like bits of oyster shell

1:03:51.583 --> 1:03:52.709
crushed on the ground.

1:03:52.959 --> 1:03:56.041
The creatives on this just
take things to another level.

1:03:56.125 --> 1:03:57.542
So, as an actor,
you just step on set

1:03:57.625 --> 1:03:59.291
and melt into your surroundings.

1:03:59.667 --> 1:04:01.875

the crew who were, like,

1:04:01.959 --> 1:04:04.542

for how to make it

1:04:04.625 --> 1:04:06.458

1:04:08.667 --> 1:04:09.792

1:04:13.208 --> 1:04:16.500

1:04:18.625 --> 1:04:20.667
They were this sort
of spectacle.

1:04:20.750 --> 1:04:23.834
I think people really saw it
as a holiday.

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:27.125
There was this sort of ring
that the police had set up

1:04:27.208 --> 1:04:29.375
so that no one
could get too close.

1:04:29.458 --> 1:04:31.625

it was a free-for-all.

and hundreds of people.

1:04:35.709 --> 1:04:40.083
But we actually used
digital motion capture crowds

1:04:40.166 --> 1:04:45.000
and spread out
socially distanced crowds
on green screen.

1:04:45.083 --> 1:04:46.500

1:05:04.250 --> 1:05:06.667
It won't actually be our actor,
it will be a stunt double,

than it is dangerous.

1:05:10.834 --> 1:05:13.250

but it will always stretch.

1:05:17.667 --> 1:05:18.959
So, when they drop through,

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:20.500
they're actually dropping
into a harness.

1:05:20.583 --> 1:05:22.875
And the actual pain is
at the top of the legs

1:05:22.959 --> 1:05:24.375
where the femoral arteries are.

1:05:24.542 --> 1:05:26.333
That's what takes the impact.

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:31.917
The hanging scene is just
this enormous moment

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000
within that world.

1:05:33.458 --> 1:05:38.542
Nimble appears, using the turn
to get Sue down to the gallows.

1:05:39.542 --> 1:05:42.458
We had this massive ramp,
which we built on the stage,

1:05:42.542 --> 1:05:43.875
and painted it green.

1:05:44.375 --> 1:05:46.375
Our stunt double
can run and jump,

1:05:46.458 --> 1:05:49.625
and we'd use wires just to take
the sting out of the landing.

1:05:50.125 --> 1:05:51.166
Working with the effects,

1:05:51.250 --> 1:05:53.333
they have to take
all of these shots

1:05:53.417 --> 1:05:55.542
and stick them
into a real environment.

1:05:58.792 --> 1:06:01.250
SPEAKER 2: Shoot! Shoot that!

1:06:01.959 --> 1:06:03.166
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

1:06:03.250 --> 1:06:05.333
And then, it, you know,
it all kicks off.

1:06:05.417 --> 1:06:06.667
It all goes crazy.

1:06:06.750 --> 1:06:09.333
-(CROWD CLAMORING)
-(RUMBLING)

1:06:09.625 --> 1:06:11.375
SKELLY: You see,
I knew that Amy Manson

1:06:11.458 --> 1:06:13.208
wasn't going to die
in that episode.

1:06:13.291 --> 1:06:16.959
And I was like, "Okay,
what's the loophole here?"

1:06:17.041 --> 1:06:18.750
She wanted people to see.

1:06:19.125 --> 1:06:22.083
BEN CHAPLIN:
He realizes this is a setup.

1:06:22.250 --> 1:06:24.417
"We're not hanging her,
she's hanging us."

1:06:24.875 --> 1:06:27.291
PIP TORRENS: What does happen
is completely unforeseen.

1:06:27.375 --> 1:06:29.041
You know, it is,
as Massen says,

1:06:29.125 --> 1:06:31.583
"It all comes down
to effing electricity,"

1:06:31.792 --> 1:06:33.250
which is a great line.

1:06:33.750 --> 1:06:36.500
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
-(CROWD CLAMORING)

1:06:36.583 --> 1:06:40.250
MIKE DAWSON: The railings were
hollowed out and perforated.

1:06:40.333 --> 1:06:41.875
And then we pumped
some smoke up there

1:06:41.959 --> 1:06:43.792
so that when people
are getting electrocuted,

1:06:43.875 --> 1:06:46.542
all the smoke comes out around
them like they're sizzling up.

1:06:46.625 --> 1:06:48.542
(SCREAMING, GROANING)

1:06:48.625 --> 1:06:51.166
Maladie had rigged
this whole thing up

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:53.667
to drive people to that hanging.

1:06:54.166 --> 1:06:57.125
She set up this identity
for herself

1:06:57.208 --> 1:06:59.166
that she's gonna
be able to observe.

1:06:59.250 --> 1:07:00.208
(CROWD CLAMORING)

1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:02.959
She's harboring a hell of a lot
of resentment and pain.

1:07:03.041 --> 1:07:05.083
She needs to seek revenge.

1:07:06.542 --> 1:07:09.500
CHAPLIN: Frank,
he remembers Clara,

1:07:10.208 --> 1:07:12.709
who has a kind
of fetish for the Touched.

1:07:12.792 --> 1:07:14.625
Sacrifice, you know?

1:07:14.917 --> 1:07:16.417
(GIGGLES)

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:18.709
Through a fight sequence
with Frank Mundi,

1:07:18.792 --> 1:07:21.500
the two end up
switching positions.

1:07:22.041 --> 1:07:23.000
(GRUNTS)

1:07:23.417 --> 1:07:24.917
CHAPLIN: So, he then starts
thinking about a conversation

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.291
that he had with Effie Boyle.

1:07:26.667 --> 1:07:28.166
EFFIE BOYLE: My sales matter!

1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:31.208
He starts putting it together
that the journalist,

1:07:31.291 --> 1:07:32.667
who's been covering the trial

1:07:32.750 --> 1:07:36.959
and eager to get access
to Maladie... is Maladie.

1:07:39.583 --> 1:07:40.542
(SCREAMING)

1:07:40.625 --> 1:07:42.417
AMY MANSON:
Before the whole Maladie reveal

1:07:42.834 --> 1:07:46.834
is when you first see
she starts to feel empathy.

1:07:47.250 --> 1:07:48.125
Hurry!

1:07:48.625 --> 1:07:50.667
MANSON:
That is a beautiful moment
for the audience.

1:07:51.125 --> 1:07:53.792
Deep down, she does have
a conscience, you know?

1:07:54.041 --> 1:07:55.959
She's a person.
She's not invincible.

1:07:56.250 --> 1:07:59.709
Even the villains in our show
have so much heart.

1:08:00.083 --> 1:08:03.041
CHRISTINE BLUNDELL:
The Effie reveal was great fun.

1:08:04.667 --> 1:08:05.959
Yeah, that was
the hardest there,

1:08:06.041 --> 1:08:08.875
trying to hide Maladie's wig
under another wig.

1:08:09.583 --> 1:08:11.875
Amy just did such
a brilliant job.

1:08:12.542 --> 1:08:14.583
Teeth out,
threw them on the floor.

1:08:15.041 --> 1:08:16.542
Wig off, threw it.

1:08:16.875 --> 1:08:18.375
And she's back to Maladie.

1:08:18.917 --> 1:08:21.792
I think for the audience
that's so delicious

1:08:21.875 --> 1:08:22.834
after the event.

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:25.667
MANSON: You know, she's smart.
She's plotted, well,

1:08:25.750 --> 1:08:26.792
everything really.

1:08:27.125 --> 1:08:29.417
From the start of episode one.

1:08:30.041 --> 1:08:33.166
You realize, "Oh, my God! Okay.

1:08:33.250 --> 1:08:36.375
This is much more sophisticated
than I realized."

1:08:36.542 --> 1:08:38.750
JANE ESPENSON: A lot
of things start to pay off.

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.500
But there are a lot
of mysteries left too.
