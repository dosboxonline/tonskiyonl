[tense music playing]

00:09.592 --> 00:10.801
Peter, this is Alice.

00:10.802 --> 00:14.054
She'll oversee your training
on this assignment, so follow her lead.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.599
You're a night agent now.
Relationships are dangerous.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.183
Alice!

00:18.184 --> 00:19.893
- [gun firing]
- [Alice grunting]

00:19.894 --> 00:21.186
[Peter] <i>Alice is dead.</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:22.522
- What?
- [Peter] <i>She's gone.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:26.608
[keyboard clacking]

00:26.609 --> 00:28.777
[Warren] The file I sold
was from early development.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.321
It was called Foxglove.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.991
[tires screeching]

00:34.701 --> 00:36.036
[gun firing]

00:38.663 --> 00:39.956
[Markus] <i>We took the whole thing.</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:42.624
<i>Trust me, cousin, it's better this way.</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:45.878
Seems the Iranians may have come
into possession of classified information.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.963
[Aiden] <i>POTUS wants to bring
Night Action in on it.</i>

00:47.964 --> 00:50.299
[Haleh in Farsi] I saw Javad noticing you.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.135
- [in Farsi] I don't know him.
- [Haleh] So get to know him.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.388
[Rose] It's an obituary
for a deceased Marine named Solomon Vega.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.891
Says he's survived by his sister, Celeste.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.519
Abbas Mansuri, Iranian ambassador
to the United Nations.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.562
[Peter] Solomon Vega.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.522
- They exchanged something.
- Who took the picture?

01:05.523 --> 01:08.568
Noor Taheri. We're taking over her case.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.112
[music fades]

01:12.947 --> 01:14.949
[opening theme music playing]

01:20.747 --> 01:22.874
- [indistinct chatter]
- [car horns honking]

01:32.550 --> 01:34.344
[in Farsi] I think it's great.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.055
- It's evocative.
- [in Farsi] But?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.556
It's dangerous to print such things.

01:39.557 --> 01:43.185
Of course it's dangerous.
Anything worth a damn is dangerous.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.356
Shaukat,
even if these accusations are true,

01:46.856 --> 01:49.191
you're picking a fight
with the Revolutionary Guard.

01:49.192 --> 01:53.237
That's the purpose of the newsletter.
"To poke the eye of power."

01:53.238 --> 01:57.866
I know, but... if the mullahs read this,
they'll go crazy.

01:57.867 --> 02:01.286
You're assuming they know how to read.
Besides, what do you care?

02:01.287 --> 02:04.124
You'll be just another cog
in their machine soon enough.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.003
Not everyone gets to be
a pirate journalist.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.298
I know you don't approve
of the Foreign Ministry.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.885
But it's where I can make
a real difference.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.178
It's important to me.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.807
Just as this newsletter is to you.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.309
You should think about your brother.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.562
He'll be of conscription age
next year, won't he?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.606
These fanatics will push
their propaganda all over him.

02:29.607 --> 02:34.528
It's nonsense, of course,
but the biggest lies are wrapped in candy.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.781
Do you want him to suffer
like your father?

02:37.532 --> 02:38.407
[banging on door]

02:38.408 --> 02:40.242
[man in Farsi] Open the door! Now!

02:40.243 --> 02:41.577
You can't be here. Go!

02:41.578 --> 02:43.245
- What's happening?
- It's the police. Come.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.747
- What about you?
- I'll be fine. Hurry!

02:45.748 --> 02:47.124
[tense music playing]

02:47.125 --> 02:50.795
[man in Farsi] We know you're in there.
Open the door or we'll break it.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.633
[indistinct chatter]

02:56.634 --> 02:59.679
You were warned about
publishing treasonous lies.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.640
[man] Make way. Give us room!

03:04.893 --> 03:05.810
[car door closing]

03:08.104 --> 03:10.189
[indistinct chatter]

03:10.190 --> 03:11.774

03:13.151 --> 03:15.153
[officers speaking indistinctly]

03:57.195 --> 03:58.947
[woman vocalizing]

04:05.245 --> 04:07.497
[woman in Farsi] What happened?
Why did they take her?

04:08.706 --> 04:10.166
They were afraid of her.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.963
[opening theme music playing]

04:19.175 --> 04:20.926
[indistinct chatter]

[siren wailing in distance]

04:23.012 --> 04:25.098
[contemplative music playing]

04:39.487 --> 04:40.405
Edward?

04:41.990 --> 04:42.824
Hello?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.616
Hey.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.742
[Noor gasping, yelling]

04:45.743 --> 04:47.619
Sorry. Please.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.787
[Noor breathing heavily]

04:48.788 --> 04:49.746
Who are you?

04:49.747 --> 04:52.499
I'm Peter, this is Rose.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.917
I'm gonna say a few things.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.462
If you don't like what you hear,
you are free to leave. Okay?

04:57.338 --> 05:01.091
I don't work for the CIA,
but I've been briefed on your case.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.052
And it's my understanding
you wanna get your family out of Iran,

05:04.053 --> 05:06.055
bring them here to live in the U.S.
Is that right?

05:09.684 --> 05:10.560
Okay.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.146
Look, I'm taking over for Edward.
You understand?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.362
This is one of the photos you took

05:22.363 --> 05:24.699
of the man that met
with your ambassador, yes?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.494
- Yes.
- What can you tell me about him?

05:29.495 --> 05:31.039
The meeting was secret.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.415
He scheduled it himself.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.000
I don't know what they talked about,

05:35.001 --> 05:38.463
but the ambassador
was given a briefcase before he left.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.256
- I tried to tell Edward--
- Forget Edward. Okay?

05:41.257 --> 05:42.342
You're talking to me.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.137
- What was in the briefcase?
- I don't know. But he still has it.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.555
It's locked up in his study.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.598
Does that help?

05:49.599 --> 05:51.726
It'd help me more
if I knew what was inside it.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.063
You're asking me to get
what's in the briefcase?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.190
Long enough to make copies
of what's in there.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.358
[Noor sighing]

05:59.359 --> 06:01.902
You do that,
we will get your family out of Iran,

06:01.903 --> 06:03.945
bring them here
so you can all live together,

06:03.946 --> 06:06.824
under our protection,
with our financial assistance.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.660
- That's the offer.
- He can make that happen.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.581
- And what if I don't do it?
- Then you'll never hear from me again.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.628
And you can go back to the Mission and
try to live with the choice you've made.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.804
My brother is due to be conscripted
into the army next week.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.806
If he is, he will be shipped off to die

06:30.807 --> 06:33.601
in some pointless proxy war
just like our father was.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.938
I don't want that for him.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.440
But I have UN prep all week,

06:40.441 --> 06:42.692
a party tomorrow
at the ambassador's residence,

06:42.693 --> 06:44.653
and then a three-day water conference.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.281
I cannot neglect all of that
without being suspected.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.575
Tell me about this party.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.578
Wait, wait. I don't understand.
What exactly are you telling me?

06:53.579 --> 06:55.372
He doesn't know anything about it.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.915
An American spy sold intel

06:56.916 --> 07:00.669
about an experimental
CIA weapon called Foxglove,

07:00.670 --> 07:04.131
and you're saying that
his boss's boss at the CIA

07:04.132 --> 07:05.674
doesn't know anything about it?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.217
And that's not strange to you?

07:07.218 --> 07:10.263
No, because Gedney's not a spook,
he's a bureaucrat.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
That's why they put him in the big chair.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.224
He doesn't know shit,

07:14.225 --> 07:16.393
<i>but he's good at pushing a pencil
from A to B.</i>

07:16.394 --> 07:19.980
So you don't mind if I take a run at him?
You know, ask him a few follow-ups?

07:19.981 --> 07:23.024
- [Aiden] <i>My word's not good enough?</i>
- It's not your word I'm doubting.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.776
[Aiden] <i>Not everything is a conspiracy.</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:28.155
Political appointees are just as likely
to be dumb and feckless

07:28.156 --> 07:29.197
<i>as anyone else.</i>

07:29.198 --> 07:31.992
Are you calling
the director of the CIA dumb?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.578
And feckless. Keep up, will you?

07:34.370 --> 07:37.789
Aiden, Warren was our best lead.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.915
[Aiden] <i>You'll find others.</i>

07:38.916 --> 07:41.501
Just keep pounding the pavement.
I'll do the same on my end.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.837
And leave Gedney alone.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.714
[device beeping]

07:45.339 --> 07:46.548
[inaudible]

07:46.549 --> 07:47.466
[knocking on door]

07:47.467 --> 07:49.384
[Catherine] Miss Vega? Hello?

07:49.385 --> 07:51.471
[tense music playing]

08:00.813 --> 08:01.898
[Catherine] Celeste?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.863
Excuse me? Ma'am?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.364
Do you know the woman who lives here?

08:11.365 --> 08:13.867
- Is she in some kind of trouble?
- Oh no.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.286
I'm with the ADRC.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.997
It's a federally funded P&A system

08:18.998 --> 08:22.083
that provides financial assistance
for people with disabilities.

08:22.084 --> 08:25.046
Oh, the government.
Problem solved then. [chuckling]

08:25.713 --> 08:26.838
[Catherine chuckling lightly]

08:26.839 --> 08:30.217
I was hoping to talk to Miss Vega,
but her house looks completely empty.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.260
It was the strangest thing.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.346
Phil and I didn't even hear
the moving trucks

08:34.347 --> 08:36.765
until they rolled on
down the street this morning.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.392
She moved? In the middle of the night?

08:39.393 --> 08:40.310
[woman] Yeah.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.689
We'd help her with her groceries from time
to time, because, well... [chuckling]

08:44.690 --> 08:47.442
Poor thing. I mean,
she didn't have many folks to help her.

08:47.443 --> 08:52.365
Really? I was under the impression
she had a brother.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.788
No. No, not that I've ever seen.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.706
Yeah. I'm sorry.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.332
Thank you.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.418
[birds chirping]

09:08.673 --> 09:11.424
There are guards, security cameras,

09:11.425 --> 09:14.886
and absolutely no phones
or electronics allowed,

09:14.887 --> 09:17.597
except for pre-approved
Mission staff, like me.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.099
What's this on the third floor?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.936
That is Abbas's study,
where his briefcase is.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.438
- Sorry, I'm not very good at drawing.
- You're doing fine.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.065
- This the only staircase up?
- [Noor] No.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.277
There is a services stairwell
in the butler's pantry.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.445
- Is the study locked?
- Yes.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.699
Key card access only. He keeps it on him.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.201
That's not the only thing
you have to worry about.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.204
Javad, our head of security,
is former Quds Force.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.247
[Rose] What's that?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.458
It's an elite branch
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.586
He will be overseeing
every detail tomorrow night.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.837
What about the cameras?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.674
They record to a server
in the boiler room, I think.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.884
But as far as I know,
they are not monitored.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.177
[Peter scoffing]

09:56.178 --> 09:58.221
Okay, so all I have to do

09:58.222 --> 10:01.891
is get in, steal the key card,
take the service stairwell to the study,

10:01.892 --> 10:04.185
find the briefcase,
document what's inside,

10:04.186 --> 10:06.396
and get out, all without being detected?

10:06.397 --> 10:08.148
Well, when you put it that way...

10:08.149 --> 10:11.652
I am quite sure I can get you
the key card. It's just...

10:12.612 --> 10:13.737
It's just what?

10:13.738 --> 10:16.198
Abbas keeps it in his jacket pocket.

10:16.907 --> 10:21.621
If... if there was a distraction,
something to take his attention away...

10:22.204 --> 10:24.040
Or someone?

10:24.915 --> 10:25.750
I could...

10:26.626 --> 10:29.377
- No.
- Well, it was just an idea.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.380
- Well, we'll think of another one.
- Will we? We don't have time.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.591
Just give me a minute.

10:34.258 --> 10:36.635
Uh, Peter, I can do it. It's okay.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.512
It's not okay.
This is not why I let you stay here.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.222
[chuckling] It's just a party, right?

10:41.223 --> 10:43.892
I mean, if I get caught, I get kicked out.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.479
If you get caught,
it's an international incident.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.107
Noor's already putting herself at risk.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.735
- No.
- Can you do this by yourself?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.154
What happens if you don't find
what's in that briefcase?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.823
Something really bad, right?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.037
I can do it.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.705
I'm gonna make some calls.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.833
[suspenseful music swelling]

11:12.546 --> 11:14.547
[indistinct chatter]

11:14.548 --> 11:16.634
[music fades]

11:19.637 --> 11:22.348
- You're upset.
- A regular fucking Sherlock Holmes.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.519
- Is this about the casualties?
- More like executions, don't you think?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.521
But yeah. Yeah, that was a bit concerning.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.732
Not half as much as the robbery itself.
I thought the plan was clear.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.194
Situations change, so plans change.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.781
Besides, this puts us
in a stronger position.

11:39.281 --> 11:42.659
Forces them to take us seriously.
Which is what you want, no?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.536
What I want, Markus,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.414
is for you to understand
the delicate nature of this endeavor,

11:47.415 --> 11:51.585
the fucking global politics involved,
and how it's taken months to plan.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.463
What about your father?
His sentencing approaches.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.674
I'm working on it.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.300
I am.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.222
But he's in the mess he's in because
he let militants like you stir him up.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.808
If he'd just listened to me,
he wouldn't be imprisoned in The Hague

12:06.809 --> 12:09.979
while interlopers dismantle
our entire family legacy.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.605
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.900
No. No, please.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.781
[Solomon sighing]

12:21.282 --> 12:22.615
I take my invitation here

12:22.616 --> 12:25.702
as a signal you'd like to continue
with our arrangement.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.579
- Do I have that right?
- Yes.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.333
Yes, but thing is, I've got this lingering
question in the back of my mind.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.754
You see, I know why I'm doing this.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.673
Country, family, heritage.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.093
But what I can't quite put my finger on
is what's in it for you.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.473
Can I offer you some advice?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.393
Never ask a question
you don't already know the answer to.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.521
It's a confession of ignorance.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.981
Are you suggesting I'm ignorant?

12:54.982 --> 12:55.941
No.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.069
It's just that you're asking
the wrong person.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.031
[tense music playing]

13:04.533 --> 13:05.534
[Solomon exhaling]

13:09.789 --> 13:11.832
- [Solomon] Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.134
[music fades]

13:23.135 --> 13:24.803
[in Farsi] Why are you still working?

13:24.804 --> 13:28.765
[in Farsi] You know how Abbas gets
a week before General Assembly.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.142
"Haleh, this is serious business."

13:31.143 --> 13:33.144
"Haleh, this is important work."

13:33.145 --> 13:36.815
"Haleh, give me this. Haleh, give me that.
Haleh, Haleh, Haleh."

13:36.816 --> 13:37.732
[both chuckling]

13:37.733 --> 13:40.068
He can be demanding.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.530
I'm just looking forward to going home

13:43.531 --> 13:46.742
so Bijan and I can have
more time to ourselves.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.370
Speaking of romance...

13:50.788 --> 13:51.788
Here it comes.

13:51.789 --> 13:56.501
What? I can't be invested
in my friend's love life?

13:56.502 --> 14:00.256
Noor, look around.
We don't have much for entertainment.

14:01.173 --> 14:05.593
It was just lunch, Haleh.
It's not like we're planning to run away.

14:05.594 --> 14:09.306
But you like Javad, no?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.516
He's really very sweet.

14:11.517 --> 14:16.479
[giggling] I knew it! Didn't I tell you?
I have a sixth sense about these things.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.522
[Noor] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.110
I've heard all about your sixth sense...
And your seventh... And your eighth...

14:22.361 --> 14:24.529
[keyboard clacking]

14:24.530 --> 14:25.447
Go.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.616
I'll finish for you.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.367
Really?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.326
[Noor] Yeah.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.873
I have "serious business" to finish.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.625
[both chuckling]

14:43.048 --> 14:45.050
[tense music playing]

14:58.314 --> 15:00.399
[keyboard clacking]

15:08.115 --> 15:09.073
[music fades]

15:09.074 --> 15:10.533
How's it going out here?

15:10.534 --> 15:11.493
[file clattering]

15:12.494 --> 15:13.621
Swell, huh?

15:14.204 --> 15:16.123
I just-- I can't figure out these angles.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.084
Don't let perfection
stand in the way of progress.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.004
This has to be perfect, Rose.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.089
[train rattling]

15:24.924 --> 15:27.216
You know the thing
that I love about my work

15:27.217 --> 15:29.345
is that if you can code it,
you can build it.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.596
Of course, sometimes,

15:31.597 --> 15:34.558
my abilities don't always match up
with the ideas in my head.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.937
But on those super rare occasions,
you know what helps the most?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.606
Troubleshooting.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.317
I don't have the time
or the energy for this. Thank you, though.

15:44.318 --> 15:49.448
Okay, just think of the stupidest version
of the plan and start there.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.449
It's not about finding answers,

15:51.450 --> 15:54.787
it's about building up to them
in a way that makes sense to you.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.955
Just try it.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.290
Start stupid.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.124
You can do that, right?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.042
[both chuckling]

16:01.043 --> 16:02.670
Just... just go to sleep.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.089
Hey.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.257
Um...

16:07.841 --> 16:10.218
I'm not sure
how this will all go tomorrow,

16:10.219 --> 16:12.221
but I need you
to promise me something, okay?

16:13.555 --> 16:16.850
If something goes wrong
at this party, like, at all,

16:17.685 --> 16:19.436
you just turn around and walk out.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.855
Right then and there, no risks.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.524
Okay? Not... not even for me.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.692
[dramatic music playing]

16:25.693 --> 16:26.819
I understand.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.029
That's not good enough.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.368
I need you to promise me,
or I'll call this off.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.663
I promise. [chuckling]

16:39.206 --> 16:40.082
Night.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.839
Oh, we close at nine, sorry.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.299
Two minutes, I'll be in and out.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.426
Read the sign.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.469
[door rattling]

16:55.222 --> 16:56.431
[lock clicking]

16:56.432 --> 16:58.517
[door creaking open]

16:59.143 --> 17:00.643
[door closing]

17:00.644 --> 17:02.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, how did you...

17:02.604 --> 17:04.440
Well, the sign says open.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.942
You don't mind, right?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.318
I just need my mail.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.446
[man sighing]

17:10.988 --> 17:12.322
Okay, what's the name?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.494
Okay, one sec.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.999
- [siren wailing in distance]
- [Catherine clearing throat]

17:26.253 --> 17:27.712
[man] Here you go. [exhaling]

17:27.713 --> 17:28.797
[package thudding]

17:32.551 --> 17:34.094
[tense music playing]

17:34.845 --> 17:35.971
[man] Something wrong?

17:36.847 --> 17:37.765
Got a knife?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.769
[knife clattering]

17:45.189 --> 17:47.356
May wanna take a couple steps back.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.566
[man chuckling]

17:48.567 --> 17:49.818
Seriously.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.410
[knife scraping]

18:04.041 --> 18:05.667
There must be some mistake.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.004
I shouldn't be getting this.

18:13.050 --> 18:13.926
Oh.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.427
Yeah...

18:17.262 --> 18:18.430
Well, that's your name.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.270
[car horns honking]

18:25.938 --> 18:26.980
Hey. You're up.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.609
Hey. You know that
"start stupid" idea you had?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.237
I think it worked.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.489
So the security server they're using
probably runs on a relay,

18:36.490 --> 18:40.076
so if I can trip it, it'll give us about
15 minutes before the cameras reboot.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.662
More than enough time to get in and out
of the ambassador's office

18:42.663 --> 18:45.456
without raising any red flags
once I get the key card.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.751
Noor will come through.
I'll make sure she gets it.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.962
And, uh, you'll actually have some help.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.464
[siren wailing in distance]

18:53.841 --> 18:57.093
It's your date.
He's a Swiss attaché for special affairs.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.637
He'll make sure
you get into the party, get out clean.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.264
You have friends in Switzerland?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.809
He's Catherine's guy.
But he'll make sure you're safe.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.145
Yeah, for sure.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.606
But wait, how will you get into the party?
I'm guessing you're not on the guest list.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.483
[Peter] What's a party without catering?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.569
[Rose chuckling]

19:14.153 --> 19:16.737
- What?
- No, I... I think it's a... it's a good look.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.198
You're totally gonna pull off
that hideous vest.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.076
You're more than welcome
to return your dress and join me.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.621
Uh, no thanks.
I waited enough tables in college.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.415
I'll stick with the Swiss dude.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.416
[both chuckling]

19:28.417 --> 19:30.502
[tense music playing]

19:34.131 --> 19:35.256
[music fades]

19:35.257 --> 19:36.341
[cell phone chiming]

19:45.225 --> 19:47.269
Chasing fucking ghosts.

19:47.936 --> 19:48.937
No offense.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.025
[car engine revving]

19:57.821 --> 19:58.989
[car engine stopping]

20:00.782 --> 20:03.827
- [car doors opening, closing]
- [indistinct chatter]

20:09.583 --> 20:11.001
[Catherine] Sir? Pardon me?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.213
Are you Isaac Leeds?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.257
Uh, girls, go in the house.
I'll be right in.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.676
[Isaac] Yeah, I'm Isaac.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.802
Isaac, hi.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.929
I'm Catherine.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.138
[door opening]

20:24.139 --> 20:26.349
I worked with your late cousin, Alice,

20:26.350 --> 20:30.353
and I just wanted to extend
my personal condolences,

20:30.354 --> 20:32.189
as well as an apology.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.982
Apology for what?

20:34.566 --> 20:37.944
Well, it seems there was
some kind of shipping mishap,

20:37.945 --> 20:43.200
but this should have gotten
to her loved ones much sooner.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.246
You know, I barely knew Alice.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.583
My uncle, her dad,
he talked about her all the time.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.502
He was really proud too.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.295
Especially when she joined the FBI.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.672
[somber music playing]

20:57.673 --> 20:59.632
[Isaac] But then she got some promotion,
I guess,

20:59.633 --> 21:02.594
and she came around less and less,

21:03.428 --> 21:06.556
until one day,
everyone just stopped hearing from her.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.269
I don't know if it was the job,
or something about us,

21:11.270 --> 21:15.274
but... I know that it broke her dad's heart.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.486
You sent it back.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.906
Something like that,

21:24.032 --> 21:26.743
it should be with someone
that really knew her.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.662
Cared about her.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.797
[door opening, closing]

21:42.467 --> 21:44.468
[tense music playing]

21:44.469 --> 21:45.469
[knocking on door]

21:45.470 --> 21:46.887
- [Haleh] Noor.
- [in Farsi] Come in.

21:46.888 --> 21:47.806
[door opening]

21:49.016 --> 21:51.225
Let's go. We have work to do
before the guests arrive.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.227
[Noor] I'm coming.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.397
[door closing]

21:58.525 --> 21:59.818
[drawer sliding open]

22:09.036 --> 22:10.287
[drawer sliding closed]

22:18.628 --> 22:19.796
[Noor exhaling]

22:20.839 --> 22:23.258
- [dramatic music playing]
- [woman vocalizing]

22:26.762 --> 22:28.764
[Noor breathing deeply, exhaling]

22:29.556 --> 22:30.765
- [music fades]
- [Peter exhaling]

22:30.766 --> 22:31.682
Okay.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.393
- You good?
- [Rose] Yeah.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.271
Is it too much?

22:37.272 --> 22:40.067
Uh, no. No, you look... you look great.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.818
[Rose exhaling]

22:42.319 --> 22:45.321
Could you give me a hand?
I couldn't get the clasps to hook.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.239
Yeah.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.202
[siren wailing in distance]

22:53.455 --> 22:54.915
- There you go.
- [Rose] Thanks.

22:57.417 --> 23:01.253
Okay, now, remember, if there's any
problem or trouble, make sure--

23:01.254 --> 23:03.255
Walk out the front door,
forget you ever existed.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.840
"Peter who?" Got it.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.218
- Rose, this is serious.
- I understand.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.054
[dramatic music playing]

23:10.430 --> 23:12.099
Okay, well, see you at the party.

23:12.682 --> 23:13.850
Okay. Be careful.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.353
- Good luck.
- [Peter] You too.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.113
[Peter sighing]

23:26.947 --> 23:28.322
[tense music playing]

23:28.323 --> 23:30.409
[siren wailing in distance]

23:32.452 --> 23:33.829
What's your name, dear?

23:34.329 --> 23:35.288
Uh, Rose.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.666
Rose?

23:38.708 --> 23:39.543
Yeah.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.753
[man inhaling deeply]

23:42.754 --> 23:47.174
So for the purposes of this evening,
I'm going to, um, introduce you

23:47.175 --> 23:49.970
as... Bettina.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.306
- Bettina?
- Is that satisfactory?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.307
Whatever you think works.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.642
[both chuckling]

23:56.643 --> 23:57.561
Grand.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.690
So, uh, how long
have you worked with Catherine?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.276
Not "with." For.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.528
She's more of a captor than a colleague.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.989
- A captor?
- [man] Mmm.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.828
A few years back, I made an error,
particulars of which I'd like to forget.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.913
And she caught me,

24:18.415 --> 24:19.416
red-handed.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.544
So this is my penance.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.548
My way of making up for her silence.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.925
How many more favors
does she have on that punch card?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.219
[Rose chuckling]

24:32.304 --> 24:34.222
Let's just focus on tonight, shall we?

24:35.223 --> 24:36.348
Mm-hmm.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.266
All right.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.352
[suspenseful music playing]

24:41.688 --> 24:42.814
[brakes squealing]

24:53.408 --> 24:54.326
[car door closing]

24:59.748 --> 25:01.457
[indistinct chatter]

25:01.458 --> 25:04.127
Iran welcomes
our friends from Switzerland.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.922
- Enjoy your evening.
- Thank you.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.176
Uh...

25:11.843 --> 25:12.677
Ma'am.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.890
- Your phone.
- Oh, I didn't bring one.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.308
Oh.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.022
[Rose chuckling softly]

25:24.523 --> 25:25.482
Thank you, darling.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.904
[man] Don't worry. They're not gonna see...

25:32.030 --> 25:34.031
[indistinct chatter]

25:34.032 --> 25:36.117
[classical piano music playing]

25:40.247 --> 25:42.123
[inaudible]

25:43.667 --> 25:47.169
Uh, we're at a party, dear.
It's rude not to mingle.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.630
[sighing] I just don't wanna lose track
of him.

25:49.631 --> 25:53.218
We'll find him when the time is right.
Till then, patience.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.845
[tense music playing]

25:57.722 --> 26:00.267
- I'm gonna grab some more empties, okay?
- [woman] Okay.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.572
[lock clicks]

26:21.454 --> 26:23.289
[watch beeping]

26:23.290 --> 26:25.208
[suspenseful music playing]

26:25.875 --> 26:27.877
[indistinct chatter]

26:45.645 --> 26:49.398
Ambassador. Your reception
for the foreign minister's a triumph.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.899
- Emil!
- [Emil chuckling]

26:50.900 --> 26:54.236
I wasn't expecting a visit
from our Swiss friends this evening.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.697
And yet here I am,
materializing nonetheless.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.948
[Abbas] Always welcome.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.033
[both chuckling]

26:59.034 --> 27:01.660
Please. Allow me
to introduce my companion.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.162
Her name is Bettina.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.415
Welcome. Pleasure to meet you.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.541
[in German] What happened to the last one?

27:07.542 --> 27:09.627
[in German] Alas,
they come and they go, don't they?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.171
[Abbas] How old is she?

27:11.671 --> 27:14.466
[in English] Bettina,
tell me, are you American?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.467
I hope that's not a problem.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.887
No, not for me, but for you.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.805
- November, big decision...
- Oh.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.351
Knox or Hagan for president.
Which one will you choose?

27:25.352 --> 27:27.436
Seems like an easy decision to me.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.520
[Abbas] Ah.

27:28.521 --> 27:32.566
Emil, you've got a politician
on your hands.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.151
- [in German] Watch out.
- [all chuckling]

27:34.152 --> 27:35.235
Yeah.

27:35.236 --> 27:38.030
[in German] I'll watch out
for a great number of things with her.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.116
[all chuckling]

27:41.576 --> 27:43.243
[Rose] Oh, what are those?

27:43.244 --> 27:45.996
[in English] Oh,
pomegranate crostinis. Delicious.

27:45.997 --> 27:49.625
- Please, help yourself.
- I'm gonna take two, if that's okay.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.711
[Abbas speaking German indistinctly]

27:56.091 --> 27:57.466
[Emil speaking German indistinctly]

27:57.467 --> 27:59.803
[Rose coughing]

28:02.972 --> 28:04.056
Bettina.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.349
I think she's choking.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.184
- Are you choking?
- Darling.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.894
- She is choking.
- Do something.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.771
- [Abbas] Are you choking?
- [Emil] Do something.

28:10.772 --> 28:11.772
[Rose coughing]

28:11.773 --> 28:13.649
[Emil] Do something, ambassador.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.734
Please.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.486
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.446
I'm fine.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.782
[Emil] You gave us an awful fright.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.954
You. Come help me with something. Now.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.581
[ominous music playing]

28:34.546 --> 28:36.548
[Rose] I... I just need to get some water.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.095
[tense music playing]

28:43.012 --> 28:45.472
- [whispering] What happened?
- Javad just took him somewhere.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.891
Who, Peter? Where?

28:47.892 --> 28:51.396
I... I don't know but we don't have
much time left. What should we do?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.314
I, um...

28:54.357 --> 28:56.024
I... I just need some air.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.652
What? No, where are you going?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.615
[Rose exhaling]

29:06.244 --> 29:07.119
[Rose sighing]

29:07.120 --> 29:09.163
[suspenseful music playing]

29:09.164 --> 29:11.290
- Do you still have the key card?
- Yes.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.002
Give it to me. And your phone.
I need it to take pictures.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.546
Hurry, before I change my mind.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.299
Okay, uh, find Peter and make sure
he's okay, all right?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.843
[Rose breathing heavily]

29:25.805 --> 29:26.931
[music fades]

29:27.599 --> 29:31.310
[Peter] It's a shame, you know?
You couldn't have just re-gifted these?

29:31.311 --> 29:34.396
These are cherished gifts
from trusted allies.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.107
We would never just give them away.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.026
But of course for us,
alcohol is forbidden.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.569
So why would they gift you wine?

29:40.570 --> 29:44.990
Our last ambassador,
he was a little loose with the rules.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.036
But he was made to learn.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.998
Tell me, Matt, how long have you worked
at this catering company?

29:52.999 --> 29:53.957
[wine sloshing]

29:53.958 --> 29:55.877
[Peter] A few months. Why?

29:57.378 --> 29:59.798
You walk different than the others.

30:00.965 --> 30:01.965
How do I walk?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.176
With purpose.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.594
- Just trying to do a good job.
- [Javad] I see.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.597
And what were you doing before? For work?

30:08.598 --> 30:11.975
[Peter] Uh, retail mostly,
but that's when I was living Upstate.

30:11.976 --> 30:15.187
Now I'm just trying
to pay some bills, feed my dog.

30:15.188 --> 30:20.109
He won't go for any of the canned stuff.
He only eats the premium boiled chicken.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.696
[chuckling] What, uh... what breed?

30:24.572 --> 30:25.657
He's a yellow Lab.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.535
- You a dog guy?
- No.

30:29.702 --> 30:33.622
I was under the impression that Labradors
had a natural allergy to chicken.

30:33.623 --> 30:37.085
Not Scout. He, uh... he loves it.
Can't get enough of it.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.337
Well, I think I'm done.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.047
Can I get back to work?

30:42.048 --> 30:43.966
Otherwise, they'll stick me on the van.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.426
Um, no.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.719
[tense music playing]

30:47.720 --> 30:48.638
Not quite yet.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.520
[indistinct chatter]

31:23.923 --> 31:24.799
[device beeping]

31:27.302 --> 31:29.304
[suspenseful music playing]

31:37.896 --> 31:39.939
I spent a career in counterintelligence.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.109
I find it extremely rewarding.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.946
But like most jobs,
it tends to come home with you.

31:47.947 --> 31:50.616
Little habits you pick up along the way.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.785
For instance,
every single time I enter a room,

31:53.786 --> 31:57.206
my eyes unavoidably plot out the escapes.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.416
Every door, every window.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.835
I couldn't stop doing it if I tried.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.004
That's great, man.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.714
I don't know what this has to do with me.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.591
I was wondering the same thing

32:07.592 --> 32:10.135
when I noticed
that you share my compulsion.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.596
Counting windows and doors with your eyes.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.808
Such a strange habit for a waiter,
wouldn't you say...

32:17.185 --> 32:18.019
Matt?

32:23.524 --> 32:26.277
It's been great talking to you,
but I gotta get back to work.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.578
No, I don't believe you do.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.418
[suspenseful music swelling]

32:52.595 --> 32:53.888
[dial clicking]

32:54.639 --> 32:55.556
[whispering] Shit.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.397
[in Farsi] Is Javad in there?

33:03.398 --> 33:04.731
Abbas needs to speak with him.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.985
[in Farsi] He's busy. Go away.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.384
I don't know who you think I am, man. I...

33:31.926 --> 33:34.553
Whoever it is, yeah,
trust me, I'm a lot less interesting.

33:34.554 --> 33:38.474
No. Don't sell yourself short.
We're just getting to know one another.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.439
[camera shutter clicking]

33:47.817 --> 33:49.819
[indistinct chatter]

33:53.031 --> 33:54.449
[inaudible]

33:55.575 --> 33:57.076
[Noor's breath shuddering]

34:06.502 --> 34:08.170
[Noor breathing deeply, exhaling]

34:08.171 --> 34:09.380
Just a little bit.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.382
[exclaiming] Oh my God!

34:12.383 --> 34:14.469
[crowd gasping, murmuring]

34:16.971 --> 34:18.930
This is a bespoke designer suit!

34:18.931 --> 34:20.474
You spilled all over it!

34:20.475 --> 34:21.392
I'm sorry.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.771
Check your logs. Okay? I was cleared
to work here just like everybody else.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.608
Oh, so you're saying if I ask the other
waiters, they would vouch for you?

34:29.609 --> 34:32.736
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
- And what name should I give them?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.864
Matt. My name's Matt.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.492
Look, this is ridiculous.
I don't have to put up with this. Okay?

34:38.493 --> 34:41.036
I'm an American citizen.
This is New York fucking City.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.039
- You can't hold me prisoner.
- Can't I?

34:45.208 --> 34:49.795
This is a diplomatic residence,
which means this very room

34:49.796 --> 34:52.256
is sovereign territory
of the Islamic Republic.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.717
- Great. Does that make you mayor?
- No.

34:55.718 --> 34:56.843
It makes me God.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.638
- [knocking on door]
- [door opening]

34:59.847 --> 35:00.722
[Javad in Farsi] What?

35:00.723 --> 35:02.307
We have an issue with one of our staff.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.226
- Who?
- Noor.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.105
Take him to the basement.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.107
Put a scare into him.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.317
Then we'll find out who he really is.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.403
[suspenseful music swelling]

35:29.335 --> 35:30.335
[Emil] You careless idiot!

35:30.336 --> 35:33.046
How do you expect me
to continue this evening drenched in--

35:33.047 --> 35:34.714
What's the problem here?

35:34.715 --> 35:37.969
- I'm covered in it no thanks to her!
- Sir. Lower your voice.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.555
You're right, of course.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.890
Perhaps I got carried away.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.851
My apologies.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.687
I'll go in search of some club soda.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.693
[in Farsi] Are you okay?
Nothing happened to you, right?

35:54.318 --> 35:56.570
[in Farsi] I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.739
It's all right.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.076
Go get yourself cleaned up.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.877

[Rose breathing deeply, exhaling]

36:35.860 --> 36:36.694
[Haleh] Excuse me?

36:37.737 --> 36:40.322
What are you doing up here?
How did you get that through?

36:40.323 --> 36:42.782
Everyone's supposed
to hand in their phone at the entrance.

36:42.783 --> 36:46.912
Oh, the line in the bathroom was so long,
and I thought there was one up here.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.998
And I found this on the banister.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.043
Any idea whose it is?

36:53.878 --> 36:57.923
Yes. She works with me.
I'll make sure she gets it.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.674
Now, if you please.

36:59.675 --> 37:00.634

38:17.920 --> 38:20.505
I just gotta run to the catering van.
I'm running out of silverware.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.424
[man 3] Hey.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.011
Could you get me more
of those mini bread things?

38:26.262 --> 38:27.137
Sure.

[piano music playing]

39:06.761 --> 39:07.845

39:08.554 --> 39:09.679
Took one for the team.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.265
[both chuckling]

39:12.141 --> 39:13.017
Shall we?

39:13.517 --> 39:15.435
I just need to...

39:15.436 --> 39:19.357
[Emil] Oh, here, let me.
You've done enough for one evening.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.485
Just put in a good word
with Catherine for me, will you?

39:23.486 --> 39:24.487
[Rose chuckling]

39:24.987 --> 39:25.821
All right.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.035
Ah, my friend.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.161
[both chuckling]

39:33.162 --> 39:35.373
Wonderful evening. Fantastic.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.378
[indistinct chatter]

39:41.921 --> 39:44.255
[Byron] Of course.
That's the only reason he ever calls me.

39:44.256 --> 39:47.675
Well, I know that he would like to text.
It would be easier--

39:47.676 --> 39:48.677
[Byron] Catherine.

39:50.679 --> 39:53.140
Four years in foreign operations,

39:53.641 --> 39:56.184
five years at the bureau before that.

39:56.185 --> 39:58.478
The woman never worked a load
she couldn't clear,

39:58.479 --> 40:00.563
and if she did, she dug in,

40:00.564 --> 40:03.817
made it her life,
because that's what the job demanded.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.152
Okay, I don't know what all this is about,

40:06.153 --> 40:08.238
but tonight's hardly the time or place
for this.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.989
Yeah, you're right.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.700
But that's the thing about sacrifice,
Director Gedney.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.787
It's fucking inconvenient.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.790
Are those someone's ashes?

40:18.791 --> 40:21.251
For Christ's sake, Catherine. At dinner?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.420
Her name was Alice Leeds.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.296
She was my best, knew what it took.

40:25.297 --> 40:30.593
And all she expected in return
was for the institution to have her back.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.389
So you better get comfortable
with the sight of me, Byron,

40:34.390 --> 40:38.060
because I'm not leaving
until you tell me what she died for.

40:38.561 --> 40:39.687
[tense music playing]

40:40.438 --> 40:42.106
I'll just use the restroom.

40:42.857 --> 40:43.816
Excuse me.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.153
[Catherine exhaling]

40:48.988 --> 40:50.072
Foxglove.

40:50.656 --> 40:51.574
What is it?

40:54.994 --> 40:57.120
[door creaking open]

40:57.121 --> 40:58.205
Where've you been?

40:58.706 --> 41:01.374
I'm sorry. It took longer
than I thought to get back.

41:01.375 --> 41:04.669
You left, right?
When they took me in the back, you left?

41:04.670 --> 41:06.796
Well, I... I was going to, but--

41:06.797 --> 41:09.174
Rose, we agreed
that if something were to happen--

41:09.175 --> 41:11.260
I know. But, Peter, I did it.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.262
I got the key card, I found the briefcase,

41:14.263 --> 41:16.723
I... I took the photos,
and I snuck out in time.

41:16.724 --> 41:17.849
I did it.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.434
What do you mean? Where are they?

41:19.435 --> 41:21.520
On Noor's phone.
We're gonna get them tomorrow.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.483
- Uh, please don't be mad.
- I'm not--

41:25.983 --> 41:27.067
I'm not mad.

41:27.818 --> 41:28.694
[Peter scoffing]

41:29.653 --> 41:31.155
You shouldn't have been there.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.241
Okay? You... you should've left.
You promised me.

41:35.451 --> 41:38.078
Rose, if something
were to happen to you, I--

41:38.704 --> 41:40.706
[tender music playing]

41:42.458 --> 41:43.292
I'm okay.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.085
You're okay.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.296
We did it.

41:52.885 --> 41:53.761
You did it.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.265
[music fades]

41:59.266 --> 42:02.061
[ship horn blaring]

42:03.896 --> 42:04.730
[Peter] Hey.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.651
- How was the party?
- [Peter] It was messy.

42:09.276 --> 42:12.153
- Emil helped us out a lot though.
- [Catherine] Yes, I heard.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.740
- Who knew Rose had it in her?
- I did.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.786
Find any more ties
between Solomon Vega and Foxglove?

42:19.787 --> 42:23.581
I had an illuminating
dinner conversation last night,

42:23.582 --> 42:25.500
the details of which are still incoming,

42:25.501 --> 42:28.878
but the tenor of it
left me feeling unsettled.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.965
[water sloshing]

42:32.633 --> 42:35.678
This is the part of the job
they leave off the brochure.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.471
[softly] Yeah.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.516
You lose anybody like this before?

42:41.392 --> 42:43.644
Once. A while back.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.272
I'm sorry.

42:47.273 --> 42:50.733
I used to meet Alice here
every other week for our debriefs.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.695
The pier was her preference.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.613
I always thought the choice was tactical.

42:55.614 --> 42:58.950
It's public, it's flat, only one way in.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.536
But then I realized...

43:02.746 --> 43:04.582
she just loved the water.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.086
Back in, uh, Bangkok,

43:10.004 --> 43:13.464
she had me running
this all-night surveillance exercise.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.466
[Peter chuckling]

43:15.342 --> 43:18.595
Uh, it turns out, we were just following
her favorite food truck.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.930
[both laughing]

43:20.514 --> 43:21.724
And that's the secret.

43:22.766 --> 43:25.144
The thing that makes any good agent great.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.896
Appreciating the little things?

43:28.647 --> 43:29.647
Yeah.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.232
[somber music playing]

43:31.233 --> 43:33.527
Alice did that better than any of us.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.639
[music fades]

44:02.640 --> 44:05.099
Oh, you're not meeting
with that eel again, are you?

44:05.100 --> 44:07.852
You were in such a rotten mood
after last time.

44:07.853 --> 44:11.356
- He's my cousin, Sloane.
- Well, that's barely related.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.650
They let cousins marry, after all.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.528
Besides, he's off-putting.

44:17.154 --> 44:19.113
He's like an outside dog.

44:19.114 --> 44:20.532
Weasel's more like it.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.952
He's making moves behind my back.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.832
It's time he's reminded
of the proper pecking order.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.043
[hanger clattering]

44:32.211 --> 44:33.087
Here.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.964
Wear this one. It's more regal.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.634
It's not a tad loud?

44:39.259 --> 44:40.969
Loud colors project strength.

44:42.137 --> 44:42.970
Go on.

44:42.971 --> 44:45.057
[tense music playing]

44:45.808 --> 44:47.017
[elevator bell chiming]

44:50.813 --> 44:52.231
[elevator door closing]

45:01.281 --> 45:03.283
[Markus scoffing, chuckling]

45:05.619 --> 45:06.620
[Markus] Whew.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.335
Hmm.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.254
[Markus sniffing]

45:16.255 --> 45:17.423
[Tomás] Sagrados.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.341
Imported from Havana.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.720
- [inhaling] Mind if I help myself?
- [Tomás] No, of course not.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.806
After all, it's what you're best at.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.017
I don't understand.

45:29.518 --> 45:32.145
Our plan is moving ahead.
Are we not to celebrate?

45:32.146 --> 45:33.063
Our plan?

45:33.647 --> 45:35.482
No. My plan.

45:36.108 --> 45:38.151
Which, if you don't recall,
was quite simple.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.653
Document the mobile lab for blackmail,

45:40.654 --> 45:44.116
not steal it entirely, leaving
American bodies in your fucking wake.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.911
- How much did that cost?
- [Tomás] What?

45:48.912 --> 45:50.748
Your hands. Your nails.

45:51.498 --> 45:54.125
- This is manicure, yes?
- So?

45:54.126 --> 45:56.295
Hard hands reveal hard work.

45:57.296 --> 46:00.382
Soft hands reveal a... soft touch.

46:01.216 --> 46:02.592
It's not your fault.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.803
You were saddled
with more genteel expectations.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.722
You're forgetting your place in all this.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.100
And I think you're in over your head,
little duck.

46:12.060 --> 46:14.313
Perhaps it's time
you showed a little loyalty.

46:14.813 --> 46:15.689
To who?

46:16.607 --> 46:17.649
You know who.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.653
[Markus inhaling]
I wouldn't keep him waiting.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.198
Your father grows impatient these days.

46:25.199 --> 46:27.284
[tense music playing]

46:31.455 --> 46:32.706
[music fades]

46:37.252 --> 46:39.462
- Is she here yet?
- She's on her way.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.006
You sure she has the pictures?
You saw the documents?

46:42.007 --> 46:45.134
Yes. I mean, they were all in French,
but I scanned them all to Noor's phone.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.552
- French?
- [Rose] Mmm.

46:46.553 --> 46:47.471
Okay.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.474
Okay. Give her a few minutes.

46:52.601 --> 46:53.560
What's going on?

46:55.187 --> 46:56.063
Will you excuse us?

46:56.897 --> 46:57.731
Seriously?

46:58.857 --> 46:59.817
Okay.

47:04.029 --> 47:06.031
[footsteps receding up stairs]

47:07.866 --> 47:09.450
Is this the intel on Foxglove?

47:09.451 --> 47:12.286
What's left of it.
The rest likely vanished in a burn barrel.

47:12.287 --> 47:15.498
I don't understand. It's a bunch
of loose names and chemical agents.

47:15.499 --> 47:17.667
It's thin, but all of the pieces fit.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.586
Clandestine R&D program,
theoretical chemists.

47:20.587 --> 47:23.464
The idea was to conceive
of new synthetic weapons

47:23.465 --> 47:25.091
the U.S. could get ahead of,

47:25.092 --> 47:27.969
then create antidotes, solvents,
to counter their effects.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.888
The only problem with that was,

47:30.973 --> 47:34.893
well, they had to manufacture
the chemicals to know how to stop them.

47:35.727 --> 47:38.729
The CIA, in conjunction
with the U.S. military,

47:38.730 --> 47:42.817
secretly developed nine novel
chemical agents in a mobile lab,

47:42.818 --> 47:44.403
which, as of Friday,

47:45.070 --> 47:46.280
has gone missing.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.824
What do you mean it went missing?
Like it's stolen?

47:49.825 --> 47:53.745
They came in heavy.
Killed two Marines in the process.

47:54.955 --> 47:55.913
Holy shit.

47:55.914 --> 47:57.206
[ominous music playing]

47:57.207 --> 47:58.500
[Rose] Can we come down?

47:59.001 --> 48:00.043
Uh, yeah.

48:00.669 --> 48:02.671
[footsteps approaching]

48:04.923 --> 48:06.716
- Hey. Were you followed?
- No.

48:06.717 --> 48:10.011
But the Mission is on alert
after what happened last night.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.723
They're saying you broke
one of the guards' collarbones.

48:16.768 --> 48:17.935
Who is she?

48:17.936 --> 48:19.020
She's with us.

48:19.021 --> 48:22.356
I was told you played a major part
in getting us some much-needed intel.

48:22.357 --> 48:23.275
Is that right?

48:25.277 --> 48:26.277
It is.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.363
That kind of cooperation
goes a long way with me.

48:29.197 --> 48:31.867
The photos of the documents
Rose took, you have them?

48:33.368 --> 48:35.454
Hey, it's okay. Give her the photos.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.498
I... I didn't bring them.

48:39.249 --> 48:40.374
But they are safe.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.293
Noor.

48:42.377 --> 48:44.462
I gave you my word, and I will honor that,

48:44.463 --> 48:46.839
but first I need to know
that you will honor yours.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.843
We have to know
what's in those documents. Now.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.678
We'll get your family out,
but it'll take some time.

48:52.679 --> 48:53.639
How long?

48:54.139 --> 48:57.183
Javad is combing through
every second of our security footage,

48:57.184 --> 49:00.770
and soon he will start asking questions,
interrogate the whole Mission.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.688
I... I cannot wait any longer.

49:02.689 --> 49:03.814
Peter, she's not wrong.

49:03.815 --> 49:07.401
Extractions take time to plan,
especially in hostile countries.

49:07.402 --> 49:10.988
Miss Taheri, the people
that gave Abbas that intelligence

49:10.989 --> 49:13.074
stole something extremely dangerous.

49:13.075 --> 49:16.410
Those documents could tell us
who they are, what they're plan--

49:16.411 --> 49:17.371
No!

49:18.246 --> 49:20.081
You people ask more and more

49:20.082 --> 49:23.460
while you have held my family
over my head like a carrot.

49:24.670 --> 49:25.837
And I've delivered now.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.881
I've put myself at risk.

49:29.007 --> 49:30.425
I've betrayed my country.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.971
Now it is your turn
to do one thing for me.

49:36.723 --> 49:37.641
Noor, please.

49:38.850 --> 49:40.101
Where's your phone?

49:40.102 --> 49:41.103
I told you.

49:42.521 --> 49:43.438
Peter.

49:49.194 --> 49:51.363
I transferred the photos to a drive.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.493
Where?

49:57.452 --> 50:00.079
If those documents
are as important as you say,

50:00.080 --> 50:02.624
get my family out of Iran. Now.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.837
Then you will have your photos,
not before.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.007
[suspenseful music swelling]

50:15.178 --> 50:16.346
[music fades]

50:17.180 --> 50:19.182
[ending theme music playing]

52:21.304 --> 52:23.223
[theme music ends]
