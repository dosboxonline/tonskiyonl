the more fulfilling challenge

was to work to stop the people
who violated our privacy

that you were involved in the bombing.</i>

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
Okay, so Elliot Rome ambushed--

08:30.343 --> 08:31.427
Wait.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.012
Here comes the big finish.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.473
- [man] <i>My father loved this country.</i>
- [Elliot] <i>He sold it out.</i>

08:35.473 --> 08:38.351
<i>- You think he killed himself in order to--
- He died in a car accident.</i>

08:38.351 --> 08:41.020
<i>He was never charged.
Keep his name out of your goddamn mouth.</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:43.439
- [Elliot] <i>Killed himself in an accident.</i>
- [man] <i>Fuck off.</i>

08:43.439 --> 08:45.733
You think, uh,
Deputy Director Hawkins saw this?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.068
He's the one who sent it to me.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.152
Great.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.488
I always find a way to piss him off.
Look, I...

08:51.322 --> 08:52.323
I was keeping my cool.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.201
- Until Elliot Rome mentioned your father?
- Yeah.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.412
The Rome Tome is a bunch of
conspiracy-theory trolls spreading lies.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.456
It's not enough that I believe in you?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.875
That the president knows
you were a hero that night<i>,</i>

09:02.875 --> 09:04.710
not some deep-state accomplice?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.421
It'll all be fine
if you can just learn two words.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.007
No comment.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.052
Go ahead. Try it out.
Let me hear you say it.

No comment.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.808
Two simple words and Elliot Rome
goes looking somewhere else

09:18.808 --> 09:20.142
for his next viral video.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.395
- I got it, ma'am.
- What was our deal?

09:23.771 --> 09:26.399
You pay your dues in Night Action,
you put your time in

09:26.399 --> 09:28.901
in that hellhole of a room,
manning a phone that never rings,

09:28.901 --> 09:30.736
and better things will come your way.

09:30.736 --> 09:34.365
But you need more than just me to sign off
on a promotion. You need Hawkins too.

09:34.365 --> 09:38.202
How do you think this video convinces him
that you're ready for the next step?

09:38.202 --> 09:39.954
- Probably doesn't.
- [woman] Okay.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.081
I'm headed to Maryland
for a think-tank thing

09:42.081 --> 09:43.791
with the Scotch and Viagra crowd.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.167
Say a prayer for me.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.129
Oh, that file's for you.
Mark it up for me and leave it on my desk?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.213
Yes, ma'am.

09:49.964 --> 09:50.798
Also,

09:52.008 --> 09:54.343
listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.526
Just the man
the president was inquiring after.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.070
She'd like for you
to come in early tomorrow.

10:13.070 --> 10:13.988
Same assignment?

10:13.988 --> 10:16.365
[man] Yep, the president's
pickup basketball game.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.826
She also asked why you're throwing
your life away at the FBI

10:18.826 --> 10:21.078
instead of working for me
in the Secret Service.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.997
I'm not dumb enough
to take a bullet for someone

10:22.997 --> 10:24.790
just 'cause they got more votes.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.626
[indistinct chatter]

10:26.626 --> 10:27.627
Sutherland.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.712
- [grumbling]
- See you tomorrow, G-man.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.923
Still waiting on that crime-trend report.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.467
Diane Farr pulled me off it

10:34.467 --> 10:37.178
to analyze intel
on the new domestic terrorism paper.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.388
That report is need-to-know.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.600
I guess she thought I needed to know.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.437
And what position in the FBI
does Diane Farr occupy exactly?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.272
None, sir.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.359
That's right.
She's the president's chief of staff.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.861
So explain to me how an FBI agent

10:53.861 --> 10:56.238
gets sucked into the White House
to take orders from her.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.949
It's how she explained the job
when she offered it to me.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.368
[Hawkins] You report to us both.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.079
You seem to have forgotten
that half of the equation.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.290
I've been here for five administrations.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.418
You might wanna consider the wisdom
of hitching your wagon

11:09.418 --> 11:11.128
to someone in the political class.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.588
Yes, sir.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.133
[Hawkins] I want <i>my</i> report
by the end of the week.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.260
[whispering] Yeah.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.513
- Hi!
- [woman chuckling]

12:03.097 --> 12:05.641
- How was Rome?
- [Emma] Oh, crowded.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.893
I did throw a penny
in that fountain for you.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.730
Uncle Henry. How was the conference?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.106
Well, no free booze.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.524
It was an outrage.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.735
These things were much better
before PowerPoint.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.861
Oh, here, I can take that.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.321
I cleaned the house for you.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.489
You didn't need to do that.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.949
Uh, I don't wanna be <i>that</i> guest.

12:21.949 --> 12:22.992
You're not a guest.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.909
You're family.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.496
We've consulted lawyers and apparently,
we're legally obligated to endure you.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.790
[sighing] How much longer
are you willing to endure me?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.084
What's wrong? Your startup?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.461
How bad is it?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.045
The board officially fired me.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.131
Oh, sweetheart.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.632
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.427
We'll talk about it over dinner?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.137
Yeah. I made a lasagna.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.347
- Might as well shoot my cardiologist.
- [all chuckling]

12:47.099 --> 12:49.935
I need to personally file for bankruptcy.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.355
After the data breach, the ransomware,

12:53.355 --> 12:56.275
all my clients bailed,
and the funders turned on me.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.944
No. Rose, that's terrible.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.738
There's no chance of saving the company?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.573
Sure, just not with me running it.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.075
I had everything I owned invested in it.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.453
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.954
I don't have any money.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.915
Honey, that's what "bankrupt" means.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.627
[all laughing]

13:16.003 --> 13:17.421
[dramatic music playing]

13:17.421 --> 13:19.673
- Bankruptcy.
- [Rose] Bankruptcy.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.220
[sniffling]

13:29.016 --> 13:31.018
[crickets chirping]

13:40.778 --> 13:42.780
[sinister music playing]

13:52.623 --> 13:54.834
- [Emma] That should be everything.
- [Henry] So we're good?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.043
[Emma] It's hard to say.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.255
- [Henry] We can't run?
- [Emma] Not with Rose sleeping upstairs.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.714
[Henry] So then we fight.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.716
- [Emma] How many they'll send?
- [Henry] Maybe two.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.552
[Emma] Don't you think
they're surprising us?

14:04.552 --> 14:05.928
Maybe we surprise them.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.889
[Henry] Wouldn't be the first time
we managed to turn the tables.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.309
[Emma] We just need to get through this,
then we finish up the job.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.855
Right now, we need to burn the documents,
and then what?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.940
- [Henry] Any luck?
- [Emma] The call won't go through.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.150
[Henry] Landline's out, cell signal too.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.903
Have to figure out how to warn Osprey
if they're coming for us.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.073
- [Emma] They'll come after Osprey.
- [Henry] Seven days until they try again.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.449
[Emma] What about the engineer?

14:27.449 --> 14:29.243
- The files?
- [Henry] What about them?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.787
- How we warn people?
- That the country's in trouble?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.831
That no one in the White House
can be trusted yet.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.709
[Henry] I don't know, but we burn
what's here, so they can't get it.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377
- [Emma] Then what?
- [Henry] The woods.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.587
[Emma] How do we warn Osprey?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.256
I don't know.
Am I destroying what's here or not?

14:42.256 --> 14:43.465
[Emma] Yes, yes.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.677
[Rose gasping]

14:49.263 --> 14:51.640
[Emma] Rose. Oh, sweetheart.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.725
What's happening?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.768
Why do you have a gun?

14:54.768 --> 14:57.938
Why aren't the phones working?
The electricity? What are you burning?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.608
Rose, Rose, listen.
Can you listen to me, all right?

15:00.608 --> 15:02.276
This is not fair,

15:02.276 --> 15:04.862
and I can't tell you
the whole story right now,

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
but someone is outside.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.284
All right? And you have to pay...
you have to pay attention to me.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.953
We need to make sure
that you... you stay safe.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.038
Who's outside?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.873
We need to finish some things here first.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.876
Take this.
Go to the Feiner's house down the hill.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.629
Use their phone.
Call this number. Say these words.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.963
What does this even mean?

15:22.963 --> 15:25.215
- And it's important not to panic.
- Go out the back.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.176
No, upstairs.
They might be watching that door.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.178
Call this number, say "Night Action,"

15:29.178 --> 15:32.181
and then tell them
those exact words in that exact order.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.266
- Tell them we need help.
- I don't understand.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.644
You don't have to understand.
You just have to go.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.561
Go.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.938
- And you?
- [Henry] We'll be fine.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.106
- Go.
- Now.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.316
- Okay.
- [Emma] Go, go!

15:42.316 --> 15:44.276
[sinister music swelling]

15:44.276 --> 15:45.361
She is a survivor.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.278

17:11.572 --> 17:13.657
[Rose panting]

17:48.609 --> 17:49.610
[breathlessly] Okay.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.695
[phone beeping]

17:54.656 --> 17:55.491
Okay.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.373
[phone ringing]

18:03.373 --> 18:05.584
[suspenseful music playing]

18:07.961 --> 18:09.213
[phone ringing]

18:11.173 --> 18:12.174
Uh, yes, go ahead.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.842
Um, Night Action.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.221
<i>Uh, they... they...
they told me to tell you that.</i>

18:17.221 --> 18:18.138
Code, please.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.181
Uh, um...

18:20.140 --> 18:21.725
Pen. Clock. Door. Fire.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.607
[Rose] <i>Uh, hello? Are you still there?</i>

18:28.607 --> 18:30.943
Is this, uh, Sidewinder or Gazelle?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.736
What? I... I don't understand.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.531
What street did your best friend
Elaine live on?

18:35.531 --> 18:38.617
I... I didn't have a friend
named Elaine, okay? I--

18:38.617 --> 18:40.035
Who are you? Who did I call?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.371
[Peter sighing]

18:42.371 --> 18:45.290
Look, I need to keep this line open.
You've reached a wrong number.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.959
No, no, no, please, please.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.671
My Aunt Emma, Emma Campbell,
her and my Uncle Henry are in danger.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.089
They told me to call you.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.174
[Rose breathing heavily]

18:55.134 --> 18:55.968
[Rose] <i>Hello?</i>

18:57.177 --> 18:58.262
[Peter] <i>Yeah, I'm listening.</i>

18:58.262 --> 19:01.807
They're in danger. There's intruders,
and I... and I think they're after me too.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.350
How many intruders are there?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.561
[Rose] <i>Um, I... I think two.</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:07.938
I... I saw him.
I saw one of them. I saw his face.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.940
Okay, where are they? I need an address.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.734
Uh, 54 Wildwind Lane, in Stone Ridge.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.403
[Peter] <i>Are you with your aunt and uncle?</i>

19:14.403 --> 19:17.072
Uh, no.
Um, they're... they're at the house.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.324
I'm in the house down the hill,
the... the Feiner home.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.537
I need police
to a 54 Wildwood Lane in Stone Ridge.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.206
We have assets in danger,
two known assailants.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.710
Send a patrol to a nearby house,
last name registered Feiner.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.838
- Wait, wait, who are you talking to?
<i>-</i> [Peter] <i>I'm getting them help. You too.</i>

19:33.422 --> 19:34.464
Contact Farr and Hawkins.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.217
We have a Night Action alert,
Sidewinder and Gazelle.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.261
[breath shuddering]
Oh my God, what's happening?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.679
It's gonna be all right, okay?

19:40.679 --> 19:42.472
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Uh, Rose.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.683
Okay, Rose, I'm Peter. I'm gonna help you.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.980
[sinister music swelling]

19:57.571 --> 19:58.447
He's coming.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.532
[Rose breathing panicked]

20:01.241 --> 20:02.075
What do I do?

20:02.075 --> 20:03.327
What room are you in?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.621
- [crying] Um, I'm in the kitchen.
- Is there a basement?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
I... I don't know.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.667
<i>- I see some stairs though.
-</i> Go up the stairs.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.006
[Rose] Okay.

20:17.507 --> 20:18.759
Okay, now what?

20:19.468 --> 20:20.886
[Peter] <i>Is there a bathroom?</i>

20:23.972 --> 20:25.224
Yes.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.934
Okay. Does the door lock from the inside?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.602
- Uh, yes.
- [Peter] <i>Listen carefully.</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:31.605
Lock the door. Close it,
but do not go inside the room, understand?

20:31.605 --> 20:32.564
Okay.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.694
[door lock clicking]

20:37.694 --> 20:39.780
[suspenseful music playing]

20:43.408 --> 20:44.451
[whispering] Now what?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.870
[Peter] <i>Okay, very quietly
go to the furthest bedroom.</i>

20:46.870 --> 20:49.248
Find a closet and get inside it.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.470
<i>- Hey, Rose, are you there?</i>
- [Rose] Hang on.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.333
[floor creaking]

21:41.800 --> 21:42.759
[breath shuddering]

21:43.885 --> 21:45.429
Rose, you still with me?

21:45.429 --> 21:46.930
[whispering] I'm in the closet now.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.682
Okay, good. The police are on their way.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.267
He's already here.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.546
[Peter] <i>Rose?</i>

22:19.546 --> 22:20.672
Do you hear anything?

22:20.672 --> 22:21.631
No.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.056
- [door thudding]
- [Rose] Wait.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.392
He's breaking down the bathroom door.

22:32.976 --> 22:33.894
That's good.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.147
<i>It's good, all right? You see?
He's looking in the wrong place.</i>

22:39.107 --> 22:40.067
Just stay quiet.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.277
Stay still.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.450
He's coming.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.327
The police are on their way, all right?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.287
It's too late. [whimpering]

22:56.917 --> 22:58.126
[Peter] <i>Where is he now?</i>

23:01.588 --> 23:03.465
Okay, Rose, if he's in the room with you,

23:04.716 --> 23:07.636
but you can't talk to me,
press the zero on your phone.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.221
[phone beeping]

23:10.722 --> 23:11.973
Okay, listen to me.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.018
All right. If he finds you,
I want you to fight him.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.813
<i>You understand me?</i>

23:17.813 --> 23:20.023
[Rose's breath shuddering]

23:20.023 --> 23:22.109
I want you to fight
with everything you have.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.114
Fight like hell, Rose,
till we get there, okay?

23:32.327 --> 23:34.329
[suspenseful music swelling]

23:52.639 --> 23:54.057
[Rose breathing heavily]

23:59.479 --> 24:01.106
[Rose breathing panicked]

24:02.732 --> 24:03.567
[man] Rose?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.528
- [Rose exhaling]
- [officer] It's okay. You're safe now.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.196
Who is that? Is that the police?

24:08.196 --> 24:10.407
- Yes, they're here.
- [Peter] <i>Rose...</i>

24:11.700 --> 24:12.617
[Rose] <i>Yes?</i>

24:13.952 --> 24:16.580
I'm proud of you, okay? Good job.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.373
[officer] It's okay. Come on out.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.791
The place is empty.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.632
- [Rose sniffling]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

24:27.632 --> 24:28.967
[Rose crying] Thank you.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.472
[sinister music playing]

24:42.731 --> 24:44.065
[phone ringing]

24:44.065 --> 24:46.693
- Agent Sutherland.
- [Diane] <i>It's Farr. I got the message.</i>

24:46.693 --> 24:48.612
<i>A Night Action with two of our assets?</i>

24:48.612 --> 24:50.989
Yes, ma'am.
Codenames Sidewinder and Gazelle.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.700
<i>The woman on the line
said Emma and Henry Campbell</i>

24:53.700 --> 24:55.076
<i>were in some sort of danger.</i>

24:55.076 --> 24:57.537
- [Diane] There's a witness?
- Yeah, their niece, Rose.

24:57.537 --> 25:01.291
Okay, she said there were two intruders.
Uh, she saw one of their faces.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.834
The police have her now. She's safe.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.794
We need to get her away from local PD,

25:04.794 --> 25:05.837
<i>find out what she saw.</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:07.422
Hawkins is on his way there right now.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.633
Hawkins?
No, listen, we have to do this right.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.469
I'll go to the White House, get someone
to cover the Night Action phone,

25:12.469 --> 25:13.845
<i>but I need you now.</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:16.264
<i>I need you to get to this Rose woman
and take her somewhere.</i>

25:16.264 --> 25:18.099
Don't tell me where.
Don't tell anyone where,

25:18.099 --> 25:20.769
until we can set up a debrief
in the morning for me and Hawkins.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.480
<i>She doesn't tell you anything.
You don't tell her anything, got it?</i>

25:23.480 --> 25:24.397
Yeah, got it.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.024
Peter, if she called your number,

25:26.024 --> 25:28.443
this is more important
than you can imagine.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.237
<i>I trust you completely.</i>

25:30.237 --> 25:31.530
Yes, ma'am.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.157
- [indistinct chatter]
- [helicopter blades whirring]

25:36.785 --> 25:38.119
- Miss Larkin?
- [Rose] Yeah.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.374
I'm Jamie Hawkins,
Deputy Director of the FBI.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.626
Where's my aunt and uncle?

25:44.626 --> 25:48.171
I'm very sorry, but they were
both deceased when we arrived.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.382
No.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.175
Everyone loved them.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.512
Will someone just tell me
what's really going on?

25:55.512 --> 25:58.348
- What's actually happening here?
- We're trying to put that all together.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.017
I came straight from the White House
when I got the news.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.229
You work in the White House?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.272
Yes.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.107
And maybe you and I can talk,

26:07.107 --> 26:09.776
and we can figure out
what happened here tonight.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.695
Deputy Director Hawkins.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.697
[Hawkins] What are you doing here?

26:13.697 --> 26:16.616
Uh, Diane Farr sent me
to take Miss Larkin.

26:17.117 --> 26:17.951
You're Peter?

26:19.578 --> 26:21.705
- Rose.
- [Hawkins] Take her where?

26:21.705 --> 26:24.291
I thought we went over this.
Farr doesn't have the only say.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.960
- What does she think she's doing?
- Sir, I don't know.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.546
But she said she sent over
authorization from the president.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.506
It should be in your inbox.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.847
[indistinct police radio chatter]

26:40.223 --> 26:41.057
Hi.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.809
Hi.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.275
Look, um, we're gonna, uh,
get you some new clothes, okay?

26:51.276 --> 26:52.110
Yeah.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.573
Guess you made your choice, didn't you?

27:00.702 --> 27:03.455
I'm gonna take you away
from all this, all right?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.002
Come on. Come with me.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.684
Who do you work for?

27:24.684 --> 27:26.019
The FBI.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.897
Where are you taking me?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.148
My apartment.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.026
I just, uh,
I need to grab something real quick.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.322
My aunt and uncle,

27:37.322 --> 27:40.408
my whole life they told me
they worked in acquisitions.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.994
Conferences in London,
conventions in Vegas.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.664
But apparently,
that was all complete bullshit.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.998
Who were they really?

27:48.458 --> 27:51.086
I don't know.
I'd never heard of them before tonight.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.296
But you're the one who answered that call.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.340
You must know something.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.510
Why were they killed?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.554
Even if I knew, which I... I don't,

28:02.097 --> 28:04.224
my boss doesn't want me
telling you anything,

28:04.724 --> 28:06.351
or you telling me anything, so...

28:09.396 --> 28:10.355
Perfect.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.443
[door closing]

28:15.944 --> 28:17.070
[Peter sighing]

28:17.070 --> 28:18.571
So, what happens now?

28:19.406 --> 28:21.950
- You'll get debriefed. Give me your phone.
- Debriefed by who?

28:21.950 --> 28:24.160
Diane Farr,
the president's chief of staff,

28:24.160 --> 28:25.537
um, the guy you met at the house,

28:25.537 --> 28:27.622
that's Jamie Hawkins,
Deputy Director of the FBI,

28:27.622 --> 28:30.083
and maybe Ben Almora
from the Secret Service.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.334
But your phone, please.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.252
No.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.587
I'm trying to figure out
if we're tracked.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.340
I do not have time to debate this.
Please, your phone?

28:38.967 --> 28:39.968
Thank you.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.470
Furthest door on the right,
get some clothes out of the closet.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.764
Pack for a few days.
We leave in two minutes.

28:44.764 --> 28:46.683
[tense music playing]

28:56.568 --> 28:58.611
[keypad trilling, beeping]

28:58.611 --> 28:59.904
[computer chiming]

29:15.044 --> 29:16.212
[light switch clicking]

29:35.565 --> 29:37.108
[Peter sighing]

30:04.469 --> 30:06.471
[unnerving music playing]

30:16.773 --> 30:17.774
[Peter] Clothes fit?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.527
Uh, I... I think so.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.904
Good.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.116
Here.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.055
[Rose] I thought you said you were FBI.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.767
- I am.
- But you work in the White House?

30:52.767 --> 30:54.978
In a windowless room
in the basement, yeah.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.982
Uh, I wanna go to a police station,
someplace safe.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.984
We don't know what's safe right now.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.528
We don't know who's behind
what happened to your aunt and uncle,

31:03.528 --> 31:05.989
and I don't have time
to get you to trust me.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.074
But what I <i>can</i> tell you are my orders,

31:08.074 --> 31:11.119
which are to protect you with my life,
and I will do that.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.203
I don't know you.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.288
You can know me later.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.290
Right now,
we have to get through the night.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.047
You see something?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.132
[Peter] No.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.302
No, not yet.

31:28.011 --> 31:28.845
Let's go.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.763
[suspenseful music playing]

31:34.225 --> 31:35.184
[door closing]

31:43.026 --> 31:43.902
[Peter] Ready?

31:44.694 --> 31:45.570
[Rose] Yeah.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.406
[Peter] <i>One-half step behind me.</i>

31:48.406 --> 31:50.491
Stay between the building and me, okay?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.202
Hey, the building and me.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.288
[police siren wailing in distance]

31:56.789 --> 31:57.749
[car door opening]

32:07.008 --> 32:08.801
Hey. Hey, Rose, hold this.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.723
[man grunting]

32:13.723 --> 32:15.308
[intense music playing]

32:15.308 --> 32:16.726
[both grunting]

32:20.521 --> 32:22.065
[both straining]

32:22.649 --> 32:24.984
Who the fuck are you guys,
and why are you after her?

32:24.984 --> 32:27.111
I don't know who she is, seriously.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.321
We came for you.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.405
What?

32:29.405 --> 32:30.907
[man grunting]

32:30.907 --> 32:32.617
What are you talking about?

32:32.617 --> 32:34.410
You know what kind of asshole you're with?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.245
He tried to blow up
a metro full of people.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.040
[man 2] A traitor,
just like his father was.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.543
- It's nonsense. None of it's true.
- It's all on the Rome Tome.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.045
What was your plan here tonight?

32:44.045 --> 32:45.171
Kick your ass.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.589
How's that going so far?

32:46.589 --> 32:47.799
Give me your wallets.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.051
Give me your fucking wallets. Come on.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.851
We're not robbing them, Rose.
I need their licenses.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.269
Oh, okay.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.313
[Peter] Give them
their wallets back after that.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.150
Glen and Kurt.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.196
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna hold on to these,

33:10.196 --> 33:12.490
and you're gonna wait
for agents to come and question you.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.117
Do that, you'll get them back.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.286
If you don't, the FBI SWAT team
is gonna hunt your asses down,

33:17.787 --> 33:19.998
and you're gonna face more charges, understand?

33:19.998 --> 33:20.915
Yes, sir.

33:21.582 --> 33:22.542
[Peter] Let's go.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.169
[car alarm chirping]

33:27.296 --> 33:28.506
[cell phone ringing]

33:28.506 --> 33:30.425
- This is Farr.
<i>- Hey, it's me, Peter.</i>

33:30.425 --> 33:32.301
I got to the White House.
You have the witness?

33:33.261 --> 33:34.137
Yeah, she's fine.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.805
We got another problem though.

33:35.805 --> 33:38.808
A couple of Internet tough guys
came to my apartment looking for trouble.

33:38.808 --> 33:43.021
<i>Glen and Kurt Fensig, something like that.
I don't know, brothers, I guess.</i>

33:43.021 --> 33:44.355
<i>Rome Tome guys.</i>

33:44.355 --> 33:45.857
Send some agents by the apartment,

33:45.857 --> 33:48.276
they should be waiting
on the sidewalk under the overpass.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.318
They need questioning.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.281
Maybe a little first aid too.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.616
Done. I'll put some men
on the building overnight

33:55.616 --> 33:57.827
to make sure
there aren't any more problems.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.954
Peter, take care of her.

34:02.165 --> 34:02.999
I will.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.500
[Diane] <i>I'll see you in the morning.</i>

34:04.500 --> 34:05.710
[line clicking]

34:07.003 --> 34:09.672
Why do they think you had
something to do with the metro bombing?

34:12.592 --> 34:13.968
Because I... I was there.

34:13.968 --> 34:17.096
But I was not part of the attack, okay?
I stopped it.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.183
I'm not a traitor, all right?

34:21.142 --> 34:22.268
Neither was my father.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.396
Those articles in the binders...

34:25.396 --> 34:28.649
Yeah, people accused him,
but they never actually had any proof.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.819
Didn't even get a trial.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.864
He died in a car accident
before he could clear his name.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.289
My Aunt Emma, she, um...

34:45.124 --> 34:48.002
[smacking lips]
she did more for me than anyone.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.339
Why did I call you?

34:52.465 --> 34:53.299
What do you mean?

34:53.299 --> 34:55.843
The number my uncle gave me,
why were you the one who answered?

34:56.677 --> 34:57.929
It's my job.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.889
Answering the phone
in the White House basement

34:59.889 --> 35:01.057
when people are in trouble?

35:01.891 --> 35:03.267
Yeah, most nights I just...

35:05.561 --> 35:06.938
I analyze reports.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.234
You get a lot of calls like mine?

35:12.485 --> 35:14.695
Just one, actually. [chuckling]

35:14.695 --> 35:16.823
It was... it was a wrong number.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.077
Everything feels wrong now.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.913
[car engine revving]

35:23.913 --> 35:24.831
What?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.916
[tense music playing]

35:28.084 --> 35:30.294
Get your head down. Get down. Stay low.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.215
[truck accelerating]

35:38.386 --> 35:39.512
[car engine revving]

35:41.097 --> 35:42.515
Call the top number in my favorites.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.559
[phone beeping]

35:44.559 --> 35:46.769
[phone line ringing]

35:48.563 --> 35:50.565
[intense music playing]

35:52.316 --> 35:53.609
- [man] <i>Go ahead.
-</i> Night Action.

35:53.609 --> 35:56.571
- [man] <i>Code, please.</i>
- Dog. Plate. Grass. Trunk.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.452
This is Agent Sutherland.
I have the witness from tonight.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.955
- [man] <i>Where are you?</i>
- In my FBI vehicle. We're being followed.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.719
[Rose screaming]

36:24.015 --> 36:25.308
[Rose breathing heavily]

36:25.308 --> 36:26.893
Look at me.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.270
You're good. It's just glass.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.780
[car horns honking]

36:40.489 --> 36:41.532
[tires screeching]

36:48.789 --> 36:50.833
Take the wheel! Rose, take the wheel!

37:00.218 --> 37:01.385
Peter!

37:01.385 --> 37:02.803
[both panting]

37:24.700 --> 37:26.369
That's the guy from my aunt's house.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.372
Peter!

37:39.632 --> 37:41.175
Hold on, Rose!

37:44.679 --> 37:45.763
[Rose whimpering]

37:45.763 --> 37:47.306
See if you can get a plate.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.101
- No, I can't see anything.
- Fuck!

37:54.188 --> 37:56.190
[music fades]

37:56.983 --> 37:58.359
[crickets chirping]

37:58.359 --> 37:59.652
[Rose] What is this place?

37:59.652 --> 38:02.113
[Peter] It's an Airbnb.
It's under my friend's account.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.335
[tense music playing]

38:40.234 --> 38:42.903
Uh, no one will find us here, right?

38:42.903 --> 38:44.113
That's the idea.

38:47.074 --> 38:47.950
Okay.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.494
Sorry.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.251
[Peter sighing]

38:59.211 --> 39:01.714
Twenty-four hours ago,
I thought my life was over.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.343
Now I'll do anything to go back to then.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.184
I wish this wasn't happening.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.397
Yeah, me too.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.527
[phone chiming]

39:25.237 --> 39:26.530
[Peter exhaling]

39:29.367 --> 39:30.451
[Rose] It fits.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.203
Whose are these?

39:33.204 --> 39:34.080
Zoe's.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.499
She's my ex-fiancée.

39:37.291 --> 39:41.504
[scoffing] And you just kept her clothes?
You bury her in the woods first?

39:41.504 --> 39:44.965
No, she wanted to bury me a few times,
but she's in Texas now.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.801
She left in a hurry.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.802
I'm sorry.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.638
Oh, don't be. She's a lot happier now.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.434
You should, uh, get some sleep.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.270
Um, there's only one bedroom.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.439
You're the only one sleeping, right?

40:00.439 --> 40:01.607
I work nights.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.403
They're after me now, aren't they?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.200
Maybe they think you saw something.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.619
Okay? Or know something.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.915
Look, I mean, on the call you said
you saw one of them, right?

40:18.999 --> 40:20.209
Not very well.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.129
Didn't you recognize him in the car?

40:26.424 --> 40:30.052
Look, anything you saw,
or anything you know...

40:31.846 --> 40:34.181
you should tell them tomorrow
in the debrief.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.307
They wanna help you.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.811
Tell me everything you know first.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.813
I can't do that, Rose. I have orders.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.022
Fuck your orders.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.192
Someone killed my aunt and uncle,
and now they're trying to kill me.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.903
I'm as low-level as it gets
in the White House.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.780
Trust me, I... I don't know anything.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.157
What is Night Action?

40:54.577 --> 40:55.536
[Peter sighing]

41:00.291 --> 41:01.917
It's a counterintelligence program.

41:03.335 --> 41:07.506
Okay? I answer the phone for night agents
in distress, and I route the call.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.384
Night agents? So my...
my aunt and uncle were--

41:10.384 --> 41:12.094
People who work in acquisitions,

41:12.094 --> 41:13.971
they don't have that number
that they gave you.

Down the hall on your right.

Those two brothers
wait for the agents to show up?

45:35.899 --> 45:36.900
They did.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.403
I don't think they'll bother you again.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.363
Anything on the guy
who broke into my apartment?

45:41.363 --> 45:44.032
- Did you ID the ring or anything?
- We're looking into it.

45:45.534 --> 45:48.662
He doesn't belong here.
This is miles above your pay grade.

45:48.662 --> 45:49.747
The girl wants him here.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.542
Fine, wait in the other room.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.752
Fine.

Uh, if you need anything,
I'll just be right out here, okay?

46:04.511 --> 46:05.888
You're not coming in with me?

46:08.098 --> 46:09.266
It's miles above my pay grade.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.811
Tell them the truth
about what you saw, Rose.

46:12.811 --> 46:14.438
Okay? You can trust them.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.440
[whispering] No, I can't.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.526

there's someone in the White House

46:19.526 --> 46:20.569
who couldn't be trusted.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.156
I think they knew
there was some kind of mole or something.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.408
- Who?
- I don't know.

46:27.534 --> 46:29.578
I'm hoping it's not you,
and I don't think it's you.

46:30.537 --> 46:31.872
I have to trust someone, right?

46:32.372 --> 46:34.166
[tense music playing]

46:36.919 --> 46:40.756
I'm not telling the people in there
the truth, not if it can get me killed.

We wanna make this
as comfortable for you as possible.

Then we moved to Cleveland. Dad's new job.

Not really.

I spent my 11th birthday party
hiding out on that deck.

49:29.091 --> 49:31.176
Had the biggest crush
on this kid, Billy Edgars,

49:31.176 --> 49:32.469
and the one thing I wanted

49:32.469 --> 49:35.764
was for him to come wearing
one of these V-neck shirts he always wore.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.183
When he didn't come, I was devastated.

49:38.183 --> 49:39.851
And my brother made so much fun of me,

49:39.851 --> 49:42.187
and told everybody
that I was in love with Billy.

49:43.021 --> 49:45.399

Well, my brother could be very cruel.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.281
No, the deck.
