00:05.964 --> 00:07.716
[Ben] Maddie. She's been kidnapped.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.468
[Diane] I imagine you'd use
all of your energy to find her.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.262
That starts and ends
with Peter Sutherland.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.347
Maybe we should work this
from more than one angle.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.391
- What do you have in mind?
- Still got that flyer?

00:16.391 --> 00:17.726
[ominous music playing]

00:17.726 --> 00:22.230
[Dylan] Paulo thought if he recruited her,
she could amplify New Leaf's message.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.941
- Who else was in on this plan? Him?
- That's Matteo.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.527
[Colin] Paulo was using you
for his propaganda campaign,

00:27.527 --> 00:29.154
and I was using him to get to you.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.196
Maybe I can help you.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.240
What if I told you
Maddie was getting ready

00:32.240 --> 00:34.117
to publicly humiliate you?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.952
What are you talking about?

00:35.952 --> 00:37.162
[Diane] You should watch it.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.581
[Maddie] <i>Sarah drowned
because of you, Dad.</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:41.207
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:44.419
Whatever you're planning for my father,
we can do it together.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.628
[Diane] <i>You recognize him?</i>

00:45.628 --> 00:46.546
Yeah.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.756
[Peter] Colin Worley.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.176
He died the day before the FBI
was gonna show up and interview him.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.595
[Rose] I'd like copies
of all public records

00:53.595 --> 00:55.513
related to a Colin Worley.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.974
My aunt said that there was
only seven days till it goes down.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.351
Till what?
We think there's gonna be another attack.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.313
Everything I've done, I've done
for what you believe in. Everything.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.565
[Michelle] You need to take
a step back from this case.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.570
You told me to fight like hell.
That's what I need you to do right now.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.991
You're gonna tell me
where Peter Sutherland is.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.367
I'll make you a deal.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.411
I know who Maddie Redfield's kidnapper is.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.371
I'll give you his last known whereabouts.

01:20.371 --> 01:24.793
You find him, take care of him,
and I'll locate Peter Sutherland for you.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.378
[Chelsea] Hands up!
I said hands up! Drop the bag!

01:27.378 --> 01:29.047
[Erik] Get your fucking hands up!

01:29.714 --> 01:30.673
Peter?

01:30.673 --> 01:32.133
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.218
[music fades]

01:34.761 --> 01:36.387
[ominous music playing]

01:46.523 --> 01:49.317
[officer] Concussion probably.
We'll have an EMT check you out.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.777
[Peter] How many are dead?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.113
[officer] Just one.
Could have been a lot worse.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.739
Stay here.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.407
[suspenseful music playing]

01:57.117 --> 01:58.743
[Peter] Hey, that's... that's him.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.205
That's the guy.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.207
- [woman] Hey.
- [man] Come on.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.291
Watch it.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.168

[indistinct chatter on TV]

02:29.107 --> 02:30.024
[Colin] Hey.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.611
What are you doing here?

02:34.404 --> 02:35.947
Kendra kicked me out.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.490
No, you... you can't be here.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.868
I just need to crash for a few days.
She'll cool off.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.494
You gotta leave. It's not a good time.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.746
I'll pay for a hotel,
but you can't be here.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.498
Why are you so jacked up?

02:45.498 --> 02:46.791
I'm not.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.668
Are you using again?

02:48.668 --> 02:49.627
No.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.881
- Tell me the truth. I'm here for you.
- I'm not fucking using.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.507
I've got a lot on my plate right now,

02:54.507 --> 02:57.844
and things are just...
intense at work, all right?

02:58.928 --> 03:01.806
You remember what happened
last time things got intense for you?

03:01.806 --> 03:03.016
[cell phone vibrating]

03:03.600 --> 03:04.726
I gotta take this.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.107
- [door closing]
- Yeah?

03:11.107 --> 03:12.859
What the fuck went wrong?

03:12.859 --> 03:15.403
Someone stopped the train
after I dropped the package.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.281
- Didn't go off where it was supposed to.
- Did anyone see you?

03:18.990 --> 03:20.658
- No.
- Are you sure?

03:20.658 --> 03:22.076
Yes, I'm fucking su--

03:22.076 --> 03:23.328
[tense music playing]

03:24.579 --> 03:25.663
[Colin] <i>Sorry, I'm just...</i>

03:25.663 --> 03:29.334
Hey, the VP's gonna clean this up, right?
Take care of things for me?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, don't worry.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.837
He's got your back.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.507
Just lay low for a while
while we figure this all out.

03:36.507 --> 03:37.467
Okay.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.219
Yeah, okay.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.428
I'll be in touch.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.016
[anchor] <i>...indicating

03:55.151 --> 03:57.153
[indistinct chatter on TV]

03:59.030 --> 04:01.074
Hey, I'm thinking we order in tonight.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.326
What are you feeling?

04:06.162 --> 04:06.996
Matteo?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.754
Matteo?

04:14.754 --> 04:15.672
Oh God.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.800
Come on.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.052
Hey. Hey, wake up. Wake up.

04:21.052 --> 04:21.970
Hey.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.375
- [door closing]
- Did my father say anything?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.296
Eat.

05:45.219 --> 05:48.348
No sign of her inside.
Local police will be here any minute.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.893
Like I said, I didn't have anything to do
with Maddie Redfield going missing.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.395
Well, just in case,
shut the fuck up and don't move.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.897
We don't have her, okay?

05:55.897 --> 05:59.150
Vice President Redfield and Diane Farr
are framing Peter.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.278
Same Diane Farr you were running
an investigation for two days ago?

06:02.278 --> 06:03.488
You two have a falling-out?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
Yeah, actually,

06:05.615 --> 06:08.159
when I found out she was behind
the metro bombing a year ago.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.954
He's telling the truth.
We found the identity of the real bomber.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.664
I have the evidence in my backpack.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.003
[tense music playing]

06:19.712 --> 06:21.255
[papers rustling]

06:23.674 --> 06:24.509
Monks.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.607
- Thanks for the backup.
- [car doors closing]

06:39.607 --> 06:41.484
- This about the VP's daughter?
- [Erik] Yeah.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.570
We thought we had a lead on something,
but it turned out to be a dead end.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.947
Sorry to put you guys out.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.407
Oh, all good.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.493
Hey, you're, uh, you're the guy, right?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.370
From the, uh...

06:52.370 --> 06:55.206
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm the guy.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.834
- You know who this is?
- I know who this is.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.836
That is awesome, man.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.254
Can I get a picture with you?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.256
- Sure, yeah.
- [officer] Really?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.134
[indistinct police radio chatter]

07:06.634 --> 07:08.594
- Do one-- Do one long-ways too.
- [camera clicking]

07:08.594 --> 07:09.846
[officer] Yeah.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.473
Awesome. Thanks.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.810
Anything else we can help you guys with?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.437
Thanks, but we're good.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.230
Appreciate you boys
making the ride out here.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.189
All right.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.651
That ever get annoying?

07:23.651 --> 07:26.112
- Yes.
- [car doors opening, closing]

07:26.112 --> 07:28.614
But my kid likes to see
that stuff pop up online.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.366
- [car engine starting]
- You have a kid?

07:31.075 --> 07:31.993
Yeah.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.167
So you believe these two? Even a little?

07:39.167 --> 07:43.421
Hell no. But if it gets us closer
to finding Maddie, I say we hear them out.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.840
If either of us feels like
they're on the other side of this,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.008
we haul their asses in.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.718
All right, let's do it your way.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.474
The evidence on the hard drive proves
that if the bomb had gone off as planned,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.476
it'd have taken out
two entire city blocks.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.603
We think the person
Farr and Redfield were targeting

07:58.603 --> 08:01.522
was the same one that you were protecting
that night at the cafÃ©.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.274
If you can tell us who you were guarding--

08:03.274 --> 08:07.069
No. Focus on Worley.
How does he factor into this theory?

08:07.069 --> 08:08.946
He was on the FBI's list of suspects

08:08.946 --> 08:11.115
before that statement
was leaked from the PIF.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.992
The timing of his death seemed suspicious,

08:12.992 --> 08:15.161
so we went
to the Office of Public Records,

08:15.161 --> 08:16.204
pulled his file.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.207
We found out that Worley used to work
for a Turn Lake subsidiary.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.959
Look at the rattlesnake tattoo
from the mugshot.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.338
The metro bomber,
he had that exact same one.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.923
I saw it that night.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.342
- I know how this sounds.
- Do you?

08:31.427 --> 08:33.387
You've seen Worley before, haven't you?

08:33.888 --> 08:34.931
Who is he to you?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.437
Maddie was with her art professor
when she was kidnapped.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.899
This is a sketch
of her art professor's boyfriend.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.237
No, that's... that's impossible.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.697
Okay, Worley's dead. He OD'd a year ago,

08:51.697 --> 08:54.075
a day before the FBI
was supposed to interview him.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.284
He goes by Matteo now.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.286
We've talked to people
who've seen him this week.

08:57.286 --> 09:01.457
The autopsy report specifically states
no visible tattoos or markings.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.959
How is that possible?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.461
There's a birth certificate
in there, right?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.213
Look at that.

09:16.931 --> 09:17.974
He's a twin.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.642
[suspenseful music playing]

09:19.642 --> 09:20.560
[Peter] Okay.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.062
Okay, so they murdered
the wrong twin then.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.439
So now the metro bomber's
running around as his twin?

09:25.439 --> 09:27.733
- How does this get us to Maddie?
- I don't know.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.694
But the one lead
we haven't checked up on yet

09:29.694 --> 09:32.905
is that next-of-kin address
that we pulled off the autopsy report.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.908
P.O. box. We were on our way there
when you guys showed up.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.702
All right, I'm officially curious.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.413
But you're a long way
from proving anything to me here.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.831
So give me one good reason

09:41.831 --> 09:44.584
why we shouldn't just drag you
into the White House right now

09:44.584 --> 09:46.544
and let the higher-ups sort this shit out.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.088
The higher-ups at the White House
murdered my aunt and uncle.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.423
They're framing Peter.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.800
If you bring us in there,
they'll find a way to kill him.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.886
Plus, they've got some other attack
planned for tomorrow.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.388
Listen to me, okay?

09:57.388 --> 10:00.349
If Colin Worley is running around
as his twin brother,

10:00.349 --> 10:02.685
finding him solves both of our problems.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.021
We're looking for the same guy.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.357
We should be helping each other.
We should be working together.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.449
[Maddie] "Confess to the world
that you planned the metro bombing

10:16.449 --> 10:17.617
and covered it up."

10:17.617 --> 10:20.161
"Name names and take responsibility."

10:21.537 --> 10:24.040
"If you don't,
they'll kill me in two hours."

10:24.749 --> 10:25.750
"Please, Dad."

10:26.584 --> 10:28.336
"Tell the truth to save me."

10:32.423 --> 10:34.800
Did my dad really help bomb
the metro last year?

10:36.177 --> 10:37.053
Yes.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.391
Somebody died in that bombing.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.018
Supposed to be a lot more.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.895
A lot more.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.980
[Colin gulping]

10:47.980 --> 10:49.523
If my father did all that,

10:50.941 --> 10:53.527
then he deserves everything
that you're planning for him.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.573
I'm in this with you.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.207
[tense music playing]

11:14.882 --> 11:16.967
You saw what I did to Paulo?

11:21.013 --> 11:24.558
I will do the same to you
if you don't shut your fucking mouth.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.688
You and me are not on the same side.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.072
[door opening, closing]

11:38.072 --> 11:39.532
[lock clicking]

11:43.452 --> 11:44.662
[door creaking]

11:45.621 --> 11:48.207
[Maddie] <i>If you don't,
they'll kill me in two hours.</i>

11:48.833 --> 11:51.460
<i>Please, Dad. Tell the truth to save me.</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:53.963
Christ, she looks terrified.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.799
We should get in there,
bring Ashley up to speed.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.300
We can't show this to him.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.720
We have to.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.514
You heard him,
talking about caving to this guy.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.557
If he sees this new one,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.017
he'll be on TV crying his eyes out,
confessing to everything,

12:07.017 --> 12:08.686
and then you and I will be finished.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.521
Then what's your recommendation?

12:13.524 --> 12:15.526
Ashley, how are you holding up?

12:16.444 --> 12:19.113
[sighing] Not well, Diane.
Not fucking well.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.198
Do you have any updates?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.161
I'm doing the press conference.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.747
No, we already debated
and rejected that idea.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.874
You're not thinking clearly, understandably.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.168
I won't give them your names, okay?
I... I will--

12:32.168 --> 12:34.712
It's not an option,
so get it the fuck out of your mind.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.047
She is my one remaining daughter.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.383
Now, Maddie and I have had our issues,

12:39.383 --> 12:42.511
but I will not be the father
I saw on that nanny cam,

12:43.137 --> 12:44.221
not anymore.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.682
She wanted to show
that video to the world. She hates you.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.850
So fucking what?

12:47.850 --> 12:50.811
So she can hurt you very, very badly
if we're not careful.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.354
Well, I have to do something!

12:53.606 --> 12:54.440
I am her father.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.692
I have someone locating her, okay?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.112
They have a lead.
They are motivated to close this quickly.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.572
If we can stall the kidnapper--

13:02.740 --> 13:04.366
How do you know it's just one kidnapper?

13:05.743 --> 13:09.371
And why did they send the video
just to you?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.418
You know who this is, don't you?

13:15.628 --> 13:19.089
You... you fucking know
who has my daughter.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.301
It's the guy who did
the metro bombing for us.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.804
I... I thought we took care of him.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.764
Apparently, my team got it wrong.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.724
They neutralized his brother instead.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.059
How does that happen?

13:30.684 --> 13:33.229
And is this the same team
that's going in to save my daughter?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.064
'Cause they sound world-fucking-class.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.816
Would you like to meet them?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.861
Because if you keep using terms
like "press conference,"

13:40.861 --> 13:43.864
I can certainly arrange for them
to come by and say hello to you.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.449
Are you threatening me?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.912
So that's it.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.331
[Redfield's breath shuddering]

13:53.082 --> 13:53.999
Me or Maddie?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.297
I can manage her.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.757
She's not a liability.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.218
We'll do our best to keep her out of harm,

14:04.218 --> 14:07.137
but it'll have to be assessed
in the moment.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.682
If she gets hurt, it's on you.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.183
I'm prepared to live with that.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.352
Are you?

14:15.855 --> 14:16.772
[voice breaking] Diane?

14:19.316 --> 14:21.485
I love my daughter.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.487
I--

14:24.572 --> 14:25.489
I know.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.872
But we can't afford to lose you
in this fight, Ashley.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.417
We are so close to the finish line.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.627
Right.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.130
[Redfield crying]

14:44.633 --> 14:46.135
This isn't just about us,

14:46.677 --> 14:48.178
this is for the country.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.182
We need to know
you'll hold it together, no matter what.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.312
[Redfield sniffling]

14:57.271 --> 14:58.272
[Redfield] I'm okay.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.025
I'm okay. [sniffling]

15:02.568 --> 15:06.363
Just... get her home soon, safe, okay?

15:07.031 --> 15:07.865
Of course.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.084
- [Diane sighing]
- [cell phone vibrating]

15:23.505 --> 15:24.840
Your employee?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.760
She's checking Worley's old addresses
and places of work.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.472
Don't worry, she'll take care of him.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.099
Just him?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.646
I could amend the order.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.067
[sinister music playing]

15:46.612 --> 15:47.696
I'll let her know.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.008
[engine turning off]

16:12.930 --> 16:14.139
Stay put.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.349
We'll be right here.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.151
[doorbell chiming]

16:26.986 --> 16:27.820
Excuse me.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.489
We need access to a P.O. box.

16:31.991 --> 16:32.950
You're cops?

16:32.950 --> 16:34.410
Secret Service.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.536
You got a warrant?

16:35.536 --> 16:38.122
'Cause this sounds
kind of unconstitutional.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.748
We think the guy who rents this P.O. box

16:39.748 --> 16:41.917
abducted a young woman
under our protection.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.004
Shit, this is about
the Redfield girl, isn't it?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.632
[tense music playing]

16:49.633 --> 16:50.551
It's this one.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.719
[keys jangling]

16:56.598 --> 16:57.641
It's from you guys.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.184
What is it?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.520
We send these out
when someone's late on their rent.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.689
This customer must be renting
a storage unit from us.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.941
Can you figure out which one?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.360
Wait in the lobby. I'll need a minute.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.366
What's taking so long?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.161
Maybe they found something?

17:17.745 --> 17:19.580
We probably sounded insane to them.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.042
Like they're looking at this
completely different than we are.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.836
Protecting somebody...

17:27.379 --> 17:28.422
it weighs on you.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.217
Especially when you can't do it
as well as you hoped.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.137
Well, I'm still in one piece.

17:37.014 --> 17:37.848
Yeah,

17:38.766 --> 17:39.600
I guess.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.101
Hey.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.395
I owe you my life.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.522
Likewise.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.036
- You got a picture?
- [Erik] Hmm?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.038
Of your kid.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.385
She's cute.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.720
[Erik chuckling] Yeah.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.348
Thankfully,
she doesn't take after the old man.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.100
This, um,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.018
this was a while ago.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.272
She's been living with my ex full-time
for the past few years.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.857
You don't get to see her much?

18:28.857 --> 18:30.943
Nah, not... not since I went to rehab.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.946
But I am taking her camping
this summer, so...

18:34.655 --> 18:35.864
I just had to earn it.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.450
Earn seeing your daughter?

18:38.450 --> 18:41.286
Yeah, by staying clean, holding a job.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.788
Be the guy I was before.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.164
Before you were a hero.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.626
The world may see you as a hero,

18:47.626 --> 18:50.337
but it doesn't mean shit
if your kid sees something different.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.133
Was it hard to get clean?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.469
I was grinding to get back on the job,

18:57.469 --> 19:00.013
and I just wanted the pain
in my shoulder to go away, you know?

19:00.013 --> 19:02.474
So I started taking these pills,

19:02.474 --> 19:04.226
those pills led to Oxy,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.019
day after day after day,

19:06.019 --> 19:08.272
until that led to some bad things.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.316
[sighing] Some very bad things.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.737
But yeah, yeah, getting clean was hard,
but I was lucky too.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.533
I had my Secret Service training
to lean on, so...

19:20.284 --> 19:22.911
People think we do this job
to protect the president,

19:23.954 --> 19:26.999
some random man or woman,

19:28.250 --> 19:30.085
but we do it to protect the institution.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.963
I always loved that about the Service.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.758
It made me feel like
I was part of a... a sacred tribe.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.555
So when I started hearing about
those 12 steps, I was like,

19:41.555 --> 19:42.681
"Well, shit,

19:43.974 --> 19:45.517
I recognize that."

19:45.517 --> 19:47.227
"I can tap into that."

19:49.229 --> 19:51.315
"I've been doing it my whole adult life."

19:53.525 --> 19:54.401
[woman] Found it.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.236
Unit J3.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.449
[suspenseful music playing]

20:27.601 --> 20:30.020
- [Erik] Come on.
- Where are you taking us?

20:30.020 --> 20:33.315
Matteo has a storage unit,
and we need some extra eyes.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.610
It's time to sing for your supper.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.368
What the hell was he building?

20:45.535 --> 20:48.997
Hey, there's a pay stub for Matteo Worley
from Pykemoor Security.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.123
This is from a month ago.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.833
All right, I'll give 'em a call.

20:52.918 --> 20:53.835
[Peter] What's this?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.796
[Chelsea] Maddie's art professor, Paulo.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.756
Shit, there's a whole dossier on him.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.882
Not just him.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.969
There's a printout
of Maddie's class schedule,

21:01.969 --> 21:05.055
whole files on all her professors,
her friends.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.683
Looks like Paulo wasn't the only link
to Maddie he explored,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.351
just the weakest one.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.603
Matteo must have been planning
this for months.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.313
Do you believe us now?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.525
I did not kidnap Maddie Redfield.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.112
The owner says
he'll answer questions we have,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.572
but only if he sees my badge in person.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.450
I'd like to stake out this unit
in case Matteo comes back.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.910
I'm not leaving you alone.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.995
We'll be with her.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.956
I can handle them.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.625
You, come with me then.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.210
[Peter] We stay together.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.337
[Erik] No, you stay
where I tell you to stay.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
Hey, we're on the same side here.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.467
Good, then help us find Maddie,
and you'll be back together real soon.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.386
[dramatic music playing]

21:45.304 --> 21:46.972
Don't worry. She's in good hands.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.727
[scraping]

21:56.273 --> 21:57.649
"R142."

22:01.153 --> 22:03.155
[train horn blaring]

22:08.827 --> 22:10.037
[door creaking]

22:13.415 --> 22:15.417
[door clanging]

22:16.084 --> 22:18.545
[footsteps approaching]

22:18.545 --> 22:19.755
[keys jangling]

22:19.755 --> 22:21.006
[lock clicking]

22:28.013 --> 22:28.930
Did he respond?

22:29.431 --> 22:30.349
No.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.560
I guess he doesn't care
if you live or not.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.772
Well, how do you know
my father's even getting the videos?

22:36.772 --> 22:40.317
Because the guy I sent them to,
my ex-employer,

22:40.317 --> 22:43.320
is in deep with your daddy,
so I'm sure they got them.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.906
Maybe he's not showing them
to my father. Maybe...

22:45.906 --> 22:49.409
maybe this guy would be in trouble
if he did that. You think about that?

22:51.411 --> 22:52.662
Record another video.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.291
Send it directly to my dad's phone number.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.502
Let me use my own words this time,

22:58.502 --> 23:01.088
and I'll get him to publicly confess.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.924
I'll get what you want.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.426
[suspenseful music playing]

23:09.971 --> 23:12.432
That was Monks.
They're at Pykemoor Security,

23:12.432 --> 23:15.477
just waiting on them to release
Worley's employment records.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.021
Can I ask you something?

23:18.688 --> 23:19.564
Maybe.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.776
When I asked you who you were guarding
the day of the metro bombing,

23:22.776 --> 23:24.361
and you said it wasn't Maddie,

23:25.153 --> 23:26.113
were you lying to me?

23:26.696 --> 23:29.533
No. I wasn't even on her detail then.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.827
Okay, so then who were you guarding?

23:33.662 --> 23:37.541
Look, if I know
who the target was for the metro bomb,

23:37.541 --> 23:40.836
I might be able to figure out who Farr
and Redfield are targeting tomorrow.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.424
Maddie might be involved, okay?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
It might have something to do
with her kidnapping.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.178
Omar Zadar.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.474
He's the leader of the PIF.
His code name was Osprey.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.018
Shit, Zadar is Osprey.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.855
But he was a suspect.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.399
I didn't even know he was in the U.S.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.316
No one did.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.777
He had a secret meeting
with someone from the administration

24:05.777 --> 24:07.612
in the backroom of that cafÃ©.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.573
It went from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.867
That was during the metro bombing.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.579
Okay, so he wasn't the fall guy then.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.621
He's the target.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.165
Why try and kill him that way?

24:18.165 --> 24:19.583
Well, if you assassinate Zadar,

24:19.583 --> 24:21.460
half his country
takes to the streets, right?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.170
But if you take him out

24:23.170 --> 24:25.213
along with two city blocks
and a metro car--

24:25.213 --> 24:27.382
He would have just been another casualty.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.302
So would I.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.139
[cell phone vibrating]

24:38.602 --> 24:39.853
What? Who is it?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.229
It's Maddie.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.608
[Maddie] <i>Dad, it's me.</i>

24:44.608 --> 24:46.401
<i>I know this is hard,</i>

24:46.401 --> 24:49.321
<i>but you and I have been forced</i>

24:49.321 --> 24:52.616
<i>to train for difficult moments
all our lives.</i>

24:53.325 --> 24:55.535
<i>First Mom, and then Sarah.</i>

24:56.119 --> 24:57.621
<i>But I've learned to be strong.</i>

24:58.205 --> 24:59.539
<i>That's who we are.</i>

25:00.248 --> 25:03.126
<i>You're the only one who can save me, Dad.</i>

25:03.126 --> 25:06.004
<i>Make a video confessing
your part in the metro bombing.</i>

25:07.255 --> 25:08.089
<i>Please.</i>

25:09.007 --> 25:11.259
<i>For... me.</i>

25:11.259 --> 25:15.555
<i>Send a video
to the world right now, please.</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:19.267
<i>Otherwise, they'll kill me in 30 minutes.</i>

25:19.267 --> 25:20.644
Who sent this?

25:21.561 --> 25:23.688
Someone anonymous, only to me.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.690
Maddie must've given them my number.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.984
Look at what she's saying
when she taps the necklace.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.486
What, she's not just nervous?

25:29.486 --> 25:32.072
You didn't catch it. Good.
Hopefully, Matteo won't either.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.156
The tapping's our signal.

25:33.156 --> 25:36.368
She uses it when she wants me to get her
out of some meeting or conversation.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
But I think she's turned it into a code.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.247
She only taps it
when she says certain words.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.999
[Maddie] <i>I know this is hard,</i>

25:42.999 --> 25:46.294
<i>but you and I have been forced to train...</i>

25:46.294 --> 25:47.754
That's the first tap, "train."

25:47.754 --> 25:48.838
[Maddie] <i>...all our lives.</i>

25:48.838 --> 25:50.966
<i>First Mom, and then Sarah.</i>

25:50.966 --> 25:52.425
<i>But I've learned to be strong.</i>

25:53.552 --> 25:54.636
<i>That's who we are.</i>

25:54.636 --> 25:56.096
Second tap, "are."

25:56.096 --> 25:58.848
<i>- You're the only one who can save me, Dad.
-</i> "One."

25:58.848 --> 26:01.434
[Maddie] <i>Make a video confessing your part
in the metro bombing.</i>

26:02.102 --> 26:03.019
<i>Please.</i>

26:03.603 --> 26:05.188
<i>- For... me.</i>
- "For."

26:05.188 --> 26:06.815
<i>Send a video to...</i>

26:06.815 --> 26:09.401
- "To."
<i>- ...the world right now, please.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:12.404
<i>Otherwise, they'll kill me in 30 minutes.</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:15.156
That's it. No more taps.

26:16.199 --> 26:20.787
"Train, are, one, for, to."

26:21.788 --> 26:24.291
Train, letter R,

26:24.291 --> 26:26.418
numbers one, four, two.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.795
Yeah, train R142.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.589
A route number, maybe?

26:31.172 --> 26:33.425
- [Peter] What're you doing?
- Gotta share this with someone.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.260
There are people you can't trust.

26:35.260 --> 26:39.055
I don't know how many of them there are,
but Farr and Redfield are at the top.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.057
You send this to the wrong person,

26:41.057 --> 26:43.727
they'll realize that Maddie knows
about the metro bombing.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.853
Now, so do you.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.315
They'll send someone to kill you
just like they did with Rose and I.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.277
No, you gotta go to the press,
go public with it.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.070
I'm not going to the press.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.906
I make this public,
he might kill Maddie before we find her.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.658
So let's figure out what this means.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.203
Before all this shit, this is
the kind of stuff I did for the FBI.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.080
Trust me. I can help you.

27:06.041 --> 27:06.875
Okay.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.002
Prove it.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.879
[Maddie whimpering]

27:11.838 --> 27:13.048
Come on!

27:20.263 --> 27:23.016
[Maddie screaming, sobbing]

27:34.027 --> 27:36.237
[tense music playing]

28:10.480 --> 28:11.731
[Maddie grunting]

28:14.609 --> 28:15.735
[Diane] <i>Val?</i>

28:16.361 --> 28:17.570
Valerie?

28:18.321 --> 28:19.155
Ma'am?

28:19.155 --> 28:21.908
We get bullet points
for the Omar Zadar briefing at three?

28:21.908 --> 28:22.951
Nothing yet.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.452
Check in with DNI's office,

28:24.452 --> 28:27.914
make sure their distro list
isn't clusterfucked, again.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.837
Ashley, what are you doing here?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.672
Checking in before the Zadar thing.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.383
You know, people would understand
if you wanted to sit it out.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.592
I'm fine.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.136
[Diane] I can fill you in afterwards.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.222
I said I'm fine. We should go,
'cause the meeting's about to start.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.349
It's not for another couple of hours.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.810
It got rescheduled this morning,
starts in five.

28:49.644 --> 28:50.729
I didn't get anything.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.772
Ma'am, just got off with DNI's office,

28:52.772 --> 28:54.941
said they distributed
the bullet points two hours ago.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.276
Not sure why you never got them.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.154
Call back, figure out who I'm firing.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.949
[phone ringing]

29:02.949 --> 29:04.576
[tense music playing]

29:05.201 --> 29:07.203
[indistinct chatter]

29:09.164 --> 29:11.875
Miss Farr,
POTUS said for you to skip this one.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.169
I'm the chief of staff.
Why would I skip it?

29:14.169 --> 29:16.796
She wants you to focus on your meeting
with Representative Watkins.

29:16.796 --> 29:17.797
Watkins?

29:17.797 --> 29:19.257
Texas 22nd.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.009
You have a meeting in ten minutes.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.802
- Michelle's inside?
- Aye.

29:22.802 --> 29:24.179
Let me speak to her.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.930
Briefing's about to start.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.808
The president was insistent
that you keep the Watkins meeting.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.060
Says we need his vote
for the stimulus bill.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.481
Tell her I need five minutes
once she's done.

29:35.106 --> 29:35.940
Will do.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.401
I guess I'll be the one filling you in.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.204
And if Zadar's willing
to make these concessions,

29:49.204 --> 29:51.122
we'll discuss support
in the upcoming election.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.709
Nothing official, of course.
But ensuring the election goes smoothly--

29:54.709 --> 29:58.254
I'm sorry, but this is
a colossal fucking mistake.

29:59.130 --> 30:03.301
Uh, Zadar's still our best hope
to shore up democracy in the region.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.887
Certainly better
than the autocrat that's there now.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.807
Zadar is a goddamn terrorist!

30:08.807 --> 30:10.642
Am I the only one that sees that?

30:10.642 --> 30:14.312
Okay, um, let's take five.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.981
We've... we've been at this a while today.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.236
[door opening]

30:21.820 --> 30:23.071
[Redfield sighing]

30:23.071 --> 30:24.614
[indistinct chatter]

30:25.240 --> 30:26.074
[door closing]

30:28.076 --> 30:30.119
How are you holding up, Ashley?

30:31.079 --> 30:31.996
Been better.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.582
Almora, Willett, everyone assures me

30:34.582 --> 30:37.919
we're doing everything in our power
to bring home Maddie safe and sound.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.839
Yeah, yeah,
everybody has their assurances.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.049
Nobody expects you
to be working right now.

30:43.049 --> 30:47.387
I know. I'm just, uh, going crazy
sitting around at home waiting.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.304
Yeah.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.056
I get that.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.433
I meant what I said, Madam President.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.186
Zadar is a destabilizing force.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.814
A country run
by a terrorist group he founded

30:57.814 --> 31:00.650
cannot be a reliable military ally.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.528
Zadar has condemned PIF splinter groups.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.614
He's a legitimate politician now.
The people love him.

31:06.614 --> 31:10.910
If that's who they want in power,
how does it help us to oppose him?

31:11.619 --> 31:14.038
Why not make him a friend now
when he needs one?

31:14.622 --> 31:15.748
[Redfield sighing]

31:16.249 --> 31:17.834
I'll take the hope of a democratic future

31:17.834 --> 31:21.087
over the certainty
of an authoritarian one any day.

31:22.171 --> 31:26.134
It's your call,
but... I could not sleep at night

31:26.134 --> 31:30.388
unless I... shared with you
my honest opinion.

31:30.388 --> 31:33.016
That's why I brought you
on the ticket, Ashley.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.853
I'm sorry for the outburst, but normally
Diane is there to shout back at me.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.731
Where is she today?

31:41.941 --> 31:43.568
Between you and me,

31:44.277 --> 31:46.779
I'm thinking of a personnel change
in the West Wing.

31:48.197 --> 31:49.032
Is that right?

31:49.824 --> 31:51.826
[tense music playing]

32:01.169 --> 32:02.086
[door closing]

32:03.379 --> 32:04.589
[birds chirping]

32:04.589 --> 32:06.299
[keyboard clacking]

32:08.676 --> 32:11.054
R142 doesn't match
any train route numbers.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.680
What about boxcar serial numbers?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.182
[keyboard clacking]

32:14.182 --> 32:15.975
- Nope.
- Shit.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.519
- Uh, but not all trains run boxcars.
- [mouse clicking]

32:18.519 --> 32:21.731
Some freight trains
carry shipping containers, so maybe, um...

32:21.731 --> 32:23.691
- [mouse clicking]
- [keyboard clacking]

32:25.652 --> 32:26.486
Yeah.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.948
There are eight shipping containers
whose serial numbers are a partial match,

32:29.948 --> 32:31.950
spread across five train yards and depots.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.536
Not the most efficient use of time
if I can't call for backup on this.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.664
If our guy does come back,
I'm not here to grab him.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.208
Well, if you found us, you can find him.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.419
How did you find us by the way?

32:44.879 --> 32:46.255
Your godfather's birthday cards.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.134
So you talked to him?

32:51.594 --> 32:52.470
What'd he say?

32:53.638 --> 32:56.057
Said you weren't our guy,
that we should hear your side.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.060
[cell phone vibrating]

33:00.186 --> 33:01.145
What'd you find?

33:01.145 --> 33:03.856
Worley worked as a security guard
for the past six months.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.900
Contracted primarily for three companies.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.987
Search these. Go ahead.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.905
- [Erik] <i>Apreton Machinists...</i>
- [keyboard clacking]

33:10.905 --> 33:13.783
[Erik] <i>Opti-Vera Electric,
and CMV Manufacturing.</i>

33:15.827 --> 33:19.455
All three companies have warehouses
within a mile of the D.C. Container Depot.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.333
Hold up, Monks. Are any of
the shipping containers a partial match?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.128
Yeah.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.505
He's holding Maddie
at the D.C. Container Depot.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.008
<i>We'll text you the partial serial number.
Meet you there.</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:32.135
All right.
They think they've found Maddie.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.136
Where?

33:33.136 --> 33:35.847
Container yard.
I'll fill you in on the way.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.062
[car engine starting]

33:43.062 --> 33:44.772
[suspenseful music playing]

33:47.316 --> 33:48.651
[car engine starting]

33:53.031 --> 33:54.115
[car beeping]

33:55.491 --> 33:58.202
[Chelsea] There's a break
in the fence on the west end of the depot.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.038
- You'll see my car.
- [Erik] <i>Copy.</i>

34:24.437 --> 34:25.521
[Chelsea] R142.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.482
[Peter] Okay.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.366
[crow cawing]

34:46.209 --> 34:47.335
[cell phone chiming]

35:02.100 --> 35:03.142
[gun cocking]

35:19.534 --> 35:20.993
We're gonna have to split up.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.247
There's not enough time.

35:25.414 --> 35:26.249
Come on.

35:27.875 --> 35:28.751
Shit.

35:49.063 --> 35:49.981
Anything?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.149
[Peter] <i>No. No, you?</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:52.775
[object clanging]

35:57.071 --> 35:57.905
No.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.201
[Peter] <i>Okay,
I'm gonna go further south then.</i>

36:02.201 --> 36:04.245
[Chelsea] Copy that.
I'll take the east side.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.124
[suspenseful music swelling]

36:14.714 --> 36:16.174
Stay here. Lock the doors.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.760
- What? I'm not just gonna stay here.
- Hey, listen, this is dangerous.

36:20.553 --> 36:24.682
Do not leave until one of us gives you
the all clear. Do you understand me?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.727
- Arrington, I'm here.
- [Chelsea] <i>Good.</i>

36:27.727 --> 36:30.062
We could use the help.
Straight ahead once you're in.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.022
[Erik] <i>Copy that.</i>

36:31.606 --> 36:33.274
Stay here. Lock the doors.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.554
[Colin] We need to move.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.185
- [Maddie roaring]
- [Colin grunting]

37:09.769 --> 37:10.603
[Colin] Fuck!

37:14.315 --> 37:15.983
Shots. Arrington?

37:18.402 --> 37:19.612
Arrington, you okay?

37:20.196 --> 37:21.113
That wasn't me.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.657
[intense music playing]

37:24.033 --> 37:25.993
[Colin panting, grunting]

37:34.210 --> 37:36.337
[intense music swelling]

37:40.508 --> 37:41.592
[music fades]

37:42.635 --> 37:44.637
[suspenseful music playing]

37:49.308 --> 37:51.435
I'm at the northeast corner.
Where are you?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.770
[Erik panting]

37:53.688 --> 37:54.897
Arrington?

37:55.940 --> 37:57.066
<i>Sutherland?</i>

37:59.986 --> 38:01.570
[Maddie panting]

38:03.072 --> 38:04.615
[Colin grunting]

38:15.084 --> 38:16.460
[music fades]

38:19.130 --> 38:21.132
[Colin groaning]

38:35.271 --> 38:36.105
No!

38:46.699 --> 38:48.492
[both grunting]

38:49.410 --> 38:50.286
[Peter] Remember me?

38:51.287 --> 38:52.121
From the Metro?

38:52.121 --> 38:55.249
I need you to give up your contractor,
so I can clear my name.
