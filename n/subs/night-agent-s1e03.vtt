WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:06.965
[bomb beeping]

00:06.965 --> 00:09.467
Hey, FBI.
I need everybody to exit the train.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.594
[passengers screaming]

00:14.556 --> 00:16.558
That's him. That's the guy.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.643
[both grunting, straining]

00:19.602 --> 00:21.438
[ominous music playing]

00:24.858 --> 00:26.151
I don't know you.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.903
My orders are to protect you
with my life, and I will do that.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.905
Housekeeping.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.370
[Peter] Rose!

00:37.370 --> 00:39.039
- [Rose screaming]
- [both grunting]

00:39.622 --> 00:41.249
We got some new intel on the target.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.876
Try to close this time.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.128
She saw you at the house and can ID you.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.171
This thing makes me ill.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.298
Maybe Secret Service
needs to step in more.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.050
You stay on your own turf there,
buddy boy.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.720
Did you know Hawkins used to be
Emma and Henry Campbell's old FBI handler?

00:53.720 --> 00:54.637
What?

00:54.637 --> 00:56.598
I heard my aunt say
someone in the White House

00:56.598 --> 00:57.682
who couldn't be trusted.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.601
What else aren't you sharing?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.019
[Peter] We found a hard drive.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.314
This has national-intelligence level
security that I can't even get around.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.648
[Peter] The metro bombing.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.859
What were your aunt and uncle
doing investigating that?

01:07.859 --> 01:11.404
I don't know without being cracking it,
which I can't do without serious hardware.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.364
Hawkins called off
her Secret Service detail.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.866
A farmer found him in a field.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.577
Somebody killed
the deputy director of the FBI?

01:17.577 --> 01:20.163
Come in right now and bring Rose with you.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.373
[music fades]

01:24.292 --> 01:26.002
[ominous music playing]

01:34.886 --> 01:36.888
[lion roaring, snarling]

01:38.348 --> 01:41.476
Peter, Diane Farr,
the president's chief of staff.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.727
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.479
Looking good, all things considered.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.565
- Could have been a lot worse.
- It certainly could have.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.442
Appreciate you meeting me here.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.029
The zoo lets me come before they open.
The animals keep my morning walk spicy.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.616
The last time I was here was, like,
20 years ago with my mom and dad.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.953
We spent the whole time arguing about
what kind of animals we wanted to be.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.204
And what'd you pick?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.497
[Peter sighing] A bear.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.874
I was getting picked on a lot though.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.502
And nobody's about to punch a grizzly.
I get it.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.133
So on the phone you mentioned you had
a job you wanted to talk to me about?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.803
Have you ever heard of Night Action?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.138
Uh...

02:18.138 --> 02:19.597
Good. You shouldn't have.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.977
Night Action is a top-secret
investigative program within the FBI.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
What do they investigate?

02:25.603 --> 02:28.022
- [lion snarling]
- It's not my business to know.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.402
All I do know is that it always involves
matters of national security.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.653
Eyes only.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.322
The operatives
who conduct those investigations

02:36.322 --> 02:38.283
are known simply as night agents.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.410
So you want me to be a night agent?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.327
[Diane scoffing]

02:41.327 --> 02:43.079
God, no. Sorry.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.290
I want you to answer the phone for them.

02:45.874 --> 02:46.708
What?

02:46.708 --> 02:50.128
There's a secure emergency line
in the basement of the White House.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.630
Officially, it's a redundancy

02:52.630 --> 02:55.049
in case the FBI
needs to contact the president

02:55.049 --> 02:56.843
and other methods are compromised.

02:56.843 --> 03:02.265
In reality, if shit ever hits the fan,
a night agent can call that line for help,

03:02.265 --> 03:03.808
pass along a message.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.937
I want you to be the agent
on the receiving end of those calls.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.772
It's a dual role,

03:09.772 --> 03:11.816
FBI and White House.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.361
You'd answer to
Deputy Director Jamie Hawkins and to me.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.071
But mainly to me.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.742
So essentially,
I'd just be a glorified 911 dispatcher?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.535
The phone rarely rings.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.579
So I'd be behind a desk all day?

03:24.579 --> 03:25.747
All night.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.708
The opening is
for the 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. shift.

03:29.417 --> 03:33.213
We need someone hardworking,
trustworthy, loyal.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.841
Someone who does what's asked of them,
who knows how to step up when needed.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.052
Like you did on the metro last week.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.512
If I'm being honest,
it just sounds like a demotion.

03:41.512 --> 03:45.099
You'd be working in the White House,
close to the real decision-makers.

03:45.808 --> 03:49.145
Agents who work the phone
get their pick of assignments afterwards.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.234
Or you can wait it out in Surveillance,
hope somebody gives you a shot someday,

03:55.652 --> 03:57.570
despite your infamous last name.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.490
Seems like a pretty clear choice to me.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.575
[lions roaring, snarling]

04:03.826 --> 04:05.286
If I am interested?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.999
You gave the wrong answer before.

04:11.042 --> 04:16.297
In the wild, sure, bear, lion,
majestic, powerful, all that shit,

04:16.297 --> 04:20.551
but in here,
they're basically just giant house pets.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.596
In here there's only one creature
you should want to be.

04:24.639 --> 04:28.226
The one who decides when the others sleep,
what they eat, who they fuck.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.064
The bitch with all the keys.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.861
Welcome to the White House, Peter.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.365
[opening theme music playing]

04:43.658 --> 04:45.827
[helicopter blades whirring]

04:45.827 --> 04:47.120
[ominous music playing]

04:47.120 --> 04:49.789
- [indistinct chatter]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

04:49.789 --> 04:51.457
Peter, did you hear me?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.421
We'll be at the White House in an hour.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.714
[phone clattering]

05:00.967 --> 05:03.219
[Diane breathing deeply]

05:09.475 --> 05:11.144
[officers chatting indistinctly]

05:19.610 --> 05:21.404
[cicadas chittering]

05:22.780 --> 05:24.532
Hawkins had 30-plus years in the FBI.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.076
He had a spotless reputation.

05:27.076 --> 05:31.039
It doesn't make sense why a guy like that
would turn. I don't get it.

05:31.039 --> 05:31.998
Who gives a shit?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.000
Why did you tell your boss
we're coming in?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.043
It's an order, Rose.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.670
You and your orders, Peter!
Shuffle the fucking playlist.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.049
I'm not stepping into that White House
and just handing over their drive.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.134
You can't get into that thing.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.220
You don't have the resources.
The White House does.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.723
It could tell us who killed
your aunt and uncle, Rose.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.768
And we could be handing over key evidence
straight to their killers.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.770
I mean, Jesus Christ,

05:53.770 --> 05:57.357
the deputy director of the FBI
was just murdered <i>Godfather</i>-style.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.860
So either he was clean and got too close
to finding the actual traitor,

06:00.860 --> 06:03.613
which, by the way,
is exactly what we're trying to do--

06:03.613 --> 06:07.033
Or he was dirty, and he was working
with someone else in the White House

06:07.033 --> 06:09.243
and they killed him to cover it up.
I get it.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.038
Either of those versions
sound like we're remotely in the clear?

06:12.038 --> 06:16.250
No. But director of the FBI,
chief of staff, the president?

06:16.250 --> 06:18.795
Rose, you think all these people
have something to do with this?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.547
I don't know. And that's my entire point.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.675
I'm not going, and neither is this drive,

06:24.675 --> 06:26.761
not till we know who we can trust.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.433
When I told you that I was a nobody
at the White House, I meant it.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.645
This is way above my level.

06:37.313 --> 06:41.526
We need somebody with actual power
who can protect us,

06:42.193 --> 06:44.779
with actual resources
who can get into that thing.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.531
That's Diane Farr.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.698
We can trust her.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.785
And you'd bet your life on it? My life?

06:51.786 --> 06:52.620
Yeah.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.747
Yeah, I would.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.335
My whole career, I've been kept down

06:59.335 --> 07:03.005
because of something
my dad was suspected of doing.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.677
Farr was the only one
who never held it against me.

07:09.303 --> 07:13.182
She judged me on the merit of my actions,
not my dad's.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.228
And if you're wrong about her?

07:20.189 --> 07:21.858
[cell phone ringing, vibrating]

07:26.362 --> 07:27.196
Farr.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.197
Hey, it's me.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.615
Peter, are you on your way?

07:29.615 --> 07:30.700
<i>No, not yet.</i>

07:31.284 --> 07:32.326
<i>It's Rose.</i>

07:32.326 --> 07:33.327
<i>Her aunt and uncle,</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:35.496
the shit at the hotel,
and now Hawkins being murdered...

07:35.496 --> 07:36.414
She's just...

07:37.874 --> 07:38.958
She's a little jumpy.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.627
Can't blame her.
Everyone's on edge over here too.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.379
Why was Hawkins in that field?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.714
<i>Was he gonna meet with someone?</i>

07:44.714 --> 07:45.882
We don't know yet.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.385
[sighing] It'll be the biggest
federal investigation since JFK,

07:49.385 --> 07:50.761
and we don't know jack shit.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.638
<i>Director's briefing the president
in an hour.</i>

07:52.638 --> 07:55.892
Hopefully we'll have more clarity then.
What do you wanna do about Rose?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.269
All she needs is a good night's sleep.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.771
Give us till 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.899
[Diane] <i>Take whatever time she needs.</i>

08:02.899 --> 08:04.609
You still have the hard drive?

08:04.609 --> 08:05.902
Yeah, I got it.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.445
[Diane] <i>That's priority one.</i>

08:08.029 --> 08:09.405
And be careful, okay?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.241
- Yeah, I will.
- [door opening]

08:15.244 --> 08:18.122
Hey, I know a place
where we can stash the car overnight.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.832
- Great.
- What'd she say?

08:19.832 --> 08:21.459
We have until 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.793
You ready?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.921
Let's go camping.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.134
[man] <i>We believe he was killed elsewhere,</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:31.677
then dumped in that field.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.014
We've redirected
every available agent to solve this.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.351
So we have zero suspects,
even less evidence,

08:38.351 --> 08:41.354
and we don't know what Hawkins'
connection was to the Campbell murders.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.980
Am I missing anything?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.608
No, Madam President,
but we're working on it.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.652
Have you informed his wife yet?

08:47.652 --> 08:49.779
[man] I told Cynthia a couple hours ago.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.572
Her reaction was

08:52.782 --> 08:53.699
as you'd expect.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.577
Let me know when a good time would be
to share my condolences.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.456
That's all. Thank you.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.210
[ominous music playing]

09:11.801 --> 09:12.635
Diane.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.896
- The Campbells' niece?
- Sutherland's watching her.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.982
- And where are they now?
- [Diane] I didn't ask.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.818
It's safer that way.
He assured me they'll be here tomorrow.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.696
Doesn't really feel like
you've got control of the situation.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.324
All due respect, Michelle,
you're not making my job very easy.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.703
Oh? Whenever you call me Michelle,
I know you're pissed.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.413
I'm in the dark here.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.457
I have no idea why Hawkins
would have pulled Rose Larkin's detail,

09:43.457 --> 09:45.209
because I don't know what Henry and Emma

09:45.209 --> 09:47.670
were investigating
through Night Action to begin with.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.756
What were you using them to find out?

09:52.049 --> 09:53.217
I can't protect Rose.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.429
I can't protect you,
unless you read me in.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.351
Okay.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.857
Might wanna sit down for this.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.067
[dark music playing]

10:10.067 --> 10:11.402
[birds chirping]

10:24.707 --> 10:25.666
[Peter sighing]

10:39.472 --> 10:40.306
Morning.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.767
How long was I out for?

10:43.392 --> 10:44.769
About five hours.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.606
[sighing] Did you get any sleep?

10:48.606 --> 10:49.690
No.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.108
Maybe someday.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.611
Somebody's gotta watch the cabin.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.530
- I could have taken a shift.
- I didn't wanna wake you up.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.699
See anything yet?

10:59.784 --> 11:00.618
Nope.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.457
Look, I called Farr on her personal phone.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.042
I didn't use Night Action.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.753
Which means that if she's in on this,

11:11.295 --> 11:13.964
she could've traced the call
and sent somebody after us by now.

11:13.964 --> 11:14.882
Right?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.468
Yeah. Okay.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.427
Thank you.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.765
So we're good. Can we go now?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.061
[woman] Help!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.438
- Is anybody there?
- Get down.

11:30.022 --> 11:30.981
[woman] Please!

11:32.650 --> 11:33.609
Please!

11:34.902 --> 11:37.780
I fell on the trail!
I think I broke something!

11:37.780 --> 11:40.866
The people who killed your aunt and uncle,
could one of them have been a woman?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.826
[woman] Help!

11:42.952 --> 11:44.704
[tense music playing]

11:44.704 --> 11:45.621
[woman groaning]

11:53.504 --> 11:54.380
Hello?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.384
Back wall, back of the cabin.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.682
That's him.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.526
Let's go. Come on.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.530
[suspenseful music playing]

12:20.281 --> 12:21.157
[woman] Fuck.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.870
They're not in there. The woods.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.427
[Rose grunting]

12:42.803 --> 12:44.096
[rocks clattering]

12:46.140 --> 12:47.516
[crows cawing]

13:18.422 --> 13:19.882
[Rose panting]

13:19.882 --> 13:21.509
Guess we got our answer.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.972
- Always a tease with these two.
- Let's go.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.831
Swap out the SIM card on my phone.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.301
Yeah, it's them.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.684
2-4-1-3-5-X.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.603
- You got the license plate?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.898
- You're not gonna chase after them?
- Not with you in the car, no.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.859
Not when they outnumber me two-to-one.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.528
I got the plate. I'll send it in
to someone else to track it.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.946
Who, Farr?

14:23.946 --> 14:26.740
You need more proof that she's the traitor
my aunt was warning about?

14:26.740 --> 14:29.076
- I get how it looks, but I--
- But what?

14:29.076 --> 14:32.121
She was the only one who knew
where we were. You said it yourself.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.498
I'm just trying to consider
all the angles, okay?

14:34.498 --> 14:37.751
Occam's razor said there's
only one angle, the conniving bitch angle.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.462
We don't know that.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.056
Thank you for protecting me.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.810
[sighing] Let's just
get out of here, okay?

14:54.810 --> 14:55.936
Yeah.

15:09.074 --> 15:09.909
[Ben] Diane.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.662
Where are Sutherland and Rose Larkin?

15:13.662 --> 15:16.123
- Why?
- Well, aren't they supposed to be here?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.041
Maybe.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.626
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.086
It means you need to give me
a reason to trust you, Ben.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.593
How does a witness's Secret Service detail
get pulled without you knowing?

15:28.510 --> 15:30.012
Without your deputy knowing?

15:30.012 --> 15:33.307
I didn't catch that Hawkins
had pulled my guys till after the fact.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.434
Now I'm trying to make it right.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.022
Sutherland and Ms. Larkin
were supposed to get here earlier today,

15:40.022 --> 15:41.774
but I haven't heard from them yet.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.984
- I'll let you know when I do.
- [man] Sir?

15:43.984 --> 15:46.528
I have Agent Arrington on the line
returning your call.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.030
Please patch her through.

15:48.989 --> 15:49.907
Much appreciated.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.416
[phone line ringing]

15:59.416 --> 16:01.001
- [Ben] <i>Arrington.</i>
- Sir.

16:01.001 --> 16:01.961
How's Badger doing?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.672
At the gym, then heading to class.
Art and Activism.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.633
What I would give for a little
tedious fieldwork right about now.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.592
Rough night?

16:08.592 --> 16:11.553
[Ben sighing] <i>The shit hit the fan
with the deputy director's murder.</i>

16:11.553 --> 16:13.639
FBI wants all the backup
we could give 'em,

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
which is why I'm calling you.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.101
I'm pulling Ramirez
to aid the investigation.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.687
Copy. I'll need to swap some shifts,
but I'll make it work.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.106
There's no need.
I'm sending a replacement.

16:23.148 --> 16:23.983
Erik Monks.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.988
As in "Monks" Monks?
I thought he got out after--

16:28.988 --> 16:30.990
He's been rehabbing.
He's getting back to 100%.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.283
I was thinking I'd start him off
with something easy,

16:33.283 --> 16:34.493
<i>out of the spotlight,</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:37.454
<i>so I figured the VP's daughter's detail
was the right fit.</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:39.999
When does he start?

16:40.666 --> 16:41.500
Today.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.127
<i>I know. It's last minute.</i>

16:43.127 --> 16:46.130
I was planning on having him
join you next week, but...

16:46.755 --> 16:47.589
[sighing]

16:47.589 --> 16:49.133
...extenuating circumstances.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.011
Not a problem, sir.
I'll get him up to speed.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.928
[Ben] <i>Good girl.</i>

16:52.928 --> 16:54.054
[line clicking]

16:56.432 --> 16:57.933
[indistinct chatter]

17:06.233 --> 17:07.317
[Arrington] Maddie.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.527
I'm late for class.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.155
I wanted to introduce you
to a new member of the security team.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.157
This is Erik. Erik, Maddie Redfield.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.784
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma--
Uh, I'm sorry.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.203
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.831
[Arrington] Erik's been with
the Secret Service almost two decades.

17:20.831 --> 17:21.915
You may have heard of him.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.751
He saved the last president
a few years ago.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.753
[Maddie] That manufacturing plant in Ohio?

17:25.753 --> 17:28.380
- You're the guy who got shot?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.674
[Maddie] If Chelsea's good
with you, I'm good.

17:30.674 --> 17:34.261
By the way, I'm going out
with Izze and Daphne tonight.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.179
Where to?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
Some bar. I'll text you the deets.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.391
Gotta run.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.602
Oh, don't forget your panic button.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.571
She always forgets her panic button.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.947
Millennials, right?

17:53.947 --> 17:55.282
Actually, she's Gen Z.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.451
And millennials like me
hate the label "millennials."

17:58.035 --> 17:58.911
Noted.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.621
Keep up.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.336
Only a few friends, no significant other.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.507
She's a double major, Poli Sci and Art,
so she's in the studio a lot, painting.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.424
Got it.

18:12.424 --> 18:16.136
We try to fit in on campus as best we can,
make her feel like she isn't being watched

18:16.136 --> 18:17.179
every waking moment.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.681
Right. I'll ditch the suit.

18:20.849 --> 18:24.728
How'd a guy who saved POTUS get stuck
on the vice president's daughter's detail?

18:24.728 --> 18:28.482
Physical therapy.
It, uh... it took a while after I got shot.

18:28.482 --> 18:32.361
So I guess this is their way
of easing an old man back in.

18:33.028 --> 18:36.365
And every assignment is important, right?

18:37.574 --> 18:39.993
How'd someone so young
get to run their own detail?

18:39.993 --> 18:43.580
I'm 28, but I can look younger,
so I fit in on campus.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.540
Still...

18:44.540 --> 18:47.417
That's how Maddie wants it.
She doesn't trust many people.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.752
But she trusts you.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.090
[tense music playing]

18:55.968 --> 18:58.428
[cell phone ringing]

19:01.640 --> 19:02.641
Go for Jenkins.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.935
Cisco, what's up, brother? It's Peter.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.980
Petey. You're up past your bedtime.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.190
<i>- New number?</i>
- It's, uh... it's temporary.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.525
But do you have a minute?

19:11.525 --> 19:15.070
I need you to run a BOLO
on a gray Ford Bronco for me.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.113
You're on an op?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.532
Yeah, but can't tell you
anything else, man. Sorry.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.950
Good for you, brother.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.162
About goddamn time
they let your ass out of the basement.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.165
All right, what's the license plate?

19:26.165 --> 19:30.043
[Peter] Foxtrot, Zulu, 4-1-3-5, X-ray.

19:31.044 --> 19:31.920
Yeah.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.465
Yeah, I gotta get a new burner,
but, um, I'll call you tomorrow.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.510
I appreciate everything, man.
I owe you one. Seriously.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.345
Thanks, dude.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.223
- Shower?
- [Peter] Yeah.

19:43.223 --> 19:46.393
- Thank you.
- Sorry about Farr. I know you liked her.

19:46.393 --> 19:50.189
If it really is her behind all this,
I don't know how I didn't see it.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
What does that say about me?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.776
Maybe it says you wanna see
the good in people

19:54.776 --> 19:57.029
'cause you hope people
will see the good in you.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.781
Not my fault you're so easy to read.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.741
Fuck me.

20:01.825 --> 20:06.246
Okay, let's say Farr is not involved,
totally innocent.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.625
That means someone
had access to her call log

20:09.625 --> 20:10.918
and tracked us from your phone.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.211
Yeah.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.379
So we can't trust her
to keep the hard drive safe

20:14.379 --> 20:16.256
from whoever's trying to kill us,

20:16.256 --> 20:18.842
not until we crack it,
figure out who Osprey is,

20:18.842 --> 20:20.928
and what's happening
in, what, five days now?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.763
Well, how do we do that?

20:22.763 --> 20:27.517
Well, the drive's encryption algorithm's
too sophisticated to crack on my laptop,

20:27.517 --> 20:30.896
so I'm gonna need a beast of a computer.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.273
Like the CIA and NSA have
at the White House.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.319
What, they didn't have
any super computers for sale inside?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.863
Someone bought the last one.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.491
- [Peter chuckling]
- [Rose] Did get a burner phone though.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.577
Well, we're an hour past
my deadline with Farr,

20:45.577 --> 20:48.538
so if I don't check in soon,
that'll raise a red flag.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.669
On second thought,
what if we do give her the drive?

20:53.669 --> 20:54.753
What do you mean?

20:56.838 --> 20:59.508
So... I hate it here.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.593
Here where?

21:02.344 --> 21:03.845
This shitty motel,

21:04.346 --> 21:05.806
this depressing room.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.683
Nothing good's happened
since we checked in.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.852
- It's bad luck.
- Oh, you can't control luck.

21:10.852 --> 21:11.770
Sure you can.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.439
No, you can't.
That's why they call it luck.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.275
Okay.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.736
But you can control your surroundings.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.571
It's basic feng shui.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.909
The happier you are where you live,
the more productive you are.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.828
And this place sucks feng shui ass.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.081
- [liquid splashing]
- [man] Okay.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.875
I'll find us a different one, then?

21:33.875 --> 21:35.460
Mm-mm. No.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.671
No more motel rooms.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.923
We deserve something better.

21:40.966 --> 21:41.883
A home.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.929
Why does it feel like
you have something specific in mind?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.394
[suspenseful music playing]

21:58.650 --> 22:00.902
[sighing] So are we doing this or...?

22:00.902 --> 22:03.739
- There's gotta be another way.
- We need NSA-level shit.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.073
Kind of limits our options.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.410
Don't tell me you're having
moral quandaries.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.203
Well, what, you're not?

22:10.203 --> 22:12.331
No. The first time I shoplifted,
I was eight.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.248
Touching.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.000
Well, my mom ran off to some casino

22:15.000 --> 22:17.336
with her flavor of the month
for the long weekend,

22:17.336 --> 22:20.130
and I had just finished
my last jar of Jif on day one.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.924
I stole a packet of Flamin' Hot Cheetos
from the 7-Eleven.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.302
I felt so ashamed afterward,
I threw the whole thing up.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.636
Where is this story going, Rose?

22:26.636 --> 22:30.140
Well, the next day I went back,
I boosted a Kit Kat and a Cherry Coke,

22:30.140 --> 22:32.017
and I kept those down no problem.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.310
I'm happy for you, okay?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.395
But I never picked up the habit
of petty theft, so...

22:35.395 --> 22:37.522
Oh, you missed out. Risk and reward.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.108
Taught me everything I needed to know
about working in big tech.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.943
When people think
you're the son of a traitor,

22:41.943 --> 22:43.945
and all you wanna do is be in the FBI,

22:43.945 --> 22:46.073
you don't have the luxury
of doing shit like that.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.159
This plan of yours,

22:50.035 --> 22:50.869
if I get caught,

22:51.953 --> 22:55.207
if any of it goes wrong,
if we're wrong about any of it...

22:56.500 --> 22:57.417
I'm done.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.461
I get it.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.632
Even the slightest notion of disobeying
authority feels wrong to you.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.093
But when it's your actual life at stake,

23:06.593 --> 23:08.261
that guilt goes away real quick.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.223
[indistinct chatter]

23:11.223 --> 23:12.766
[car horn honking]

23:12.766 --> 23:17.979
Yeah, okay. Well, if we get separated,
we're gonna need a place to meet up.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.526
Yeah, a, uh, uh, meetup spot. Sure. Where?

23:23.819 --> 23:26.988
Okay, there's a place
just east of Canal and Foxhall, right?

23:26.988 --> 23:29.074
It's a park. It's called Foundry Branch.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.702
Find the pedestrian tunnel, go through it.
You'll find a pier.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.871
I used to fish on it with my dad
when I was a kid.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.208
But make sure
you're not being followed, okay?

23:38.208 --> 23:39.543
Watch for tails.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.295
Okay. I feel like such a spy now.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.255
[Peter chuckling]

23:43.255 --> 23:45.715
- It's kind of the family business, right?
- [Rose chuckling]

23:49.845 --> 23:52.180
Say it back to me.
Where are we going if we get split up?

23:52.180 --> 23:55.892
Uh, Foundry Branch, take the tunnel
to the pier, check for tails.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.478
- Good.
- Okay.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.189
Be careful.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.442
Yeah, you too.

24:11.366 --> 24:12.534
Hey, uh...

24:15.996 --> 24:17.080
You'll be okay.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.291
Yeah, so will you.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.043
And, um, for what it's worth,

24:22.043 --> 24:25.255
I'm... I'm glad it was you in the basement
who picked up my call.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.975
Beirut's moving to tomorrow.
We'll have to reschedule Watkins.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.685
Texas 22nd Watkins?

24:42.105 --> 24:44.608
Jesus, Peter. Where have you been?

24:49.029 --> 24:49.863
Hey.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.121
Rose ditched me
while I was washing up at a gas station.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.081
Luckily, I had the drive in my bag.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.791
Any idea where she is now?

25:01.791 --> 25:02.918
No idea, ma'am.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.003
We have a file on her since the attack.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.464
We'll run down possible people
she might go to.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.590
Good. Keep me in the loop.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.717
Sorry to interrupt. Drive's clean.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.344
No spyware, no Trojans.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.638
I've started a decryption
on the air gap here.

25:14.638 --> 25:15.931
How long will it take?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.099
Five hours, 40 minutes, give or take.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.060
Once he clears,
lock the room to everyone's badge

25:20.060 --> 25:21.937
except for mine and POTUS's.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.896
[man] Yes, ma'am.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.319
[elevator bell dinging]

25:29.319 --> 25:30.946
Go home, get some sleep.

25:31.446 --> 25:34.199
Almora's got Rose's description out
to the metro area.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.201
We'll get someone
to cover for you tonight.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.497
No, I think I should be by the phone.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.750
When she was at the hotel,
Rose called me on Night Action,

25:43.750 --> 25:45.710
so maybe if we give her time to think,

25:45.710 --> 25:47.796
she'll call again,
and I can convince her to come in.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.676
Or at least, uh, ping her burner,
and we can get her location that way.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.843
Smart.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.388
You're handling all of this really well,
Peter. It's noted.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.390
Thank you.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.981
[indistinct chatter]

26:09.609 --> 26:11.403
- [teacher] Nice work, Eva.
- [Eva] Thanks.

26:13.947 --> 26:17.033
- [teacher] How's it coming along?
- Maybe just come back later.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.660
Or never.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.453
[teacher sighing]

26:23.373 --> 26:25.166
Just say it. It sucks.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.918
I'm not a real artist.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.086
[teacher] I disagree.

26:28.670 --> 26:32.048
I just think
you won't show me yourself yet.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.176
I'm not hiding anything.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.261
I'm just

26:37.345 --> 26:38.471
not good anymore.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.560
I used to be,
but whatever I had, it's gone.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.522
This is Art <i>and</i> Activism, Maddie.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.026
In order to confront the world
to change it,

26:51.026 --> 26:52.444
we can't be afraid to be seen.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.405
To stand for something bold.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.242
But to do that,

26:59.743 --> 27:02.078
we first need to confront ourselves.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.416
Next time, I want you to explore
what's holding you back. Be...

27:07.292 --> 27:08.418
be fearless.

27:08.918 --> 27:09.961
Be personal.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.379
Be brave.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.173
I dare you.

27:24.601 --> 27:25.769
What is this?

27:25.769 --> 27:28.146
A very desirable neighborhood, I'm told.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.273
Wanna see our new home?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.194
Follow me.

27:34.986 --> 27:39.324
The realtor, Barb, two kids,
got into real estate after her divorce.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.034
She showed it to me this afternoon.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.702
The owners are in Florida all month,

27:42.702 --> 27:44.913
and there are no more showings
for the rest of the week.

27:44.913 --> 27:45.872
So, it's all ours.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.207
[tense music playing]

27:47.207 --> 27:52.420
[woman] Barb didn't do a very good job
of hiding the lockbox code from me.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.005
[door lock clicking]

27:55.548 --> 27:56.591
[home alarm beeping]

27:56.591 --> 27:58.176
[woman] Or the security code.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.928
[keypad beeping]

27:59.928 --> 28:01.513
[computer beeping]

28:03.098 --> 28:05.600
I told her we were newlyweds from Houston,

28:05.600 --> 28:07.936
that we were moving here for your job.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.271
She buy you as a housewife?

28:10.772 --> 28:13.983
I told her I own my own business
and that I worked remotely,

28:13.983 --> 28:18.279
because we would definitely need
two salaries for this place.

28:18.279 --> 28:25.245
Okay, so, open concept, private backyard,
primary bedroom upstairs,

28:25.245 --> 28:28.957
primary bathroom,
steam shower, Jacuzzi tub,

28:28.957 --> 28:31.167
huge walk-in closets...

28:32.711 --> 28:33.795
What do you think?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.965
I think you're not telling me something.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.760
What are you looking for here?

28:43.263 --> 28:47.058
Look, we're always moving, always hiding,

28:47.058 --> 28:48.643
And I thought maybe...

28:49.436 --> 28:51.187
- Maybe we might--
- Maybe what?

28:55.817 --> 28:59.154
Maybe we'll try this for a little while.

29:00.071 --> 29:00.947
You know?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.032
See what it's like.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.118
See what's what like?

29:05.118 --> 29:07.537
Being people who go to work and come home.

29:08.455 --> 29:12.083
Being people who cook dinner
in their kitchen,

29:12.083 --> 29:16.254
who go to sleep in their own bed
with 600 thread-count sheets.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.676
You know, these people
who live in these houses...

29:23.553 --> 29:24.679
they are not happy.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.807
They pretend.

29:29.058 --> 29:32.145
Believe me. It's like a game.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.231
You understand?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.234
We're not like them,

29:39.569 --> 29:40.445
you and me.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.782
We could be happy here...

29:46.075 --> 29:48.119
even if it's for a little while.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.331
I don't know.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.540
Uh... [sighing]

29:52.540 --> 29:54.417
Oh, come on.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.461
Hey.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.673
Play house with me...

30:04.219 --> 30:05.136
please.

30:07.889 --> 30:08.932
[man exhaling]

30:12.644 --> 30:14.229
Okay, we'll take it, then.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.355
[woman exclaiming]

30:17.524 --> 30:18.525
[cell phone chiming]

30:26.908 --> 30:29.118
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [door closing]

30:29.118 --> 30:30.411
Anywhere you like, hon.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.019
See ya.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.939
- [door opening]
- [doorbell dinging]

30:57.939 --> 30:58.982
[door closing]

31:03.778 --> 31:05.321
You on a deadline or something?

31:05.905 --> 31:08.491
- How could you tell?
- I'll keep the coffee coming.

31:08.491 --> 31:11.786
Thanks. And, uh, maybe
a double side of fries.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.204
They're bottomless, actually.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.754
[clock clicking]

31:21.754 --> 31:22.839
[scanner beeping]

[upbeat house music playing]

31:29.804 --> 31:31.890
[indistinct chatter]

31:37.020 --> 31:37.937
Status?

31:38.438 --> 31:39.647
Kitchen's all clear.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.617
Georgetown girls are supposed to be smart,
not beautiful too.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.785
[Maddie chuckling]

32:33.785 --> 32:35.036
You live around here?

32:35.036 --> 32:35.954
Yeah.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.872
Yeah, you wanna see my place?

32:39.290 --> 32:41.793
Moving a little fast, aren't you?

32:43.836 --> 32:44.712
Maybe.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.674
But I haven't told you what we'd do there.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.634
Okay.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.386
Let's hear it.

32:53.554 --> 32:54.514
Stand by.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.392
I'd lay you down on my bed,

32:58.142 --> 33:01.229
tie your hands and feet to the bed posts
so you couldn't move,

33:01.938 --> 33:05.233
and then I'd take my cock out
and piss all over your face.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.028
You think I don't know
who your fascist father is?

33:09.028 --> 33:10.446
Fuck him and fuck you.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.864
Code three. Move in, extract.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.575
- Hey.
- Let go!

33:14.575 --> 33:16.369
- [man grunting]
- [Erik groaning]

33:17.996 --> 33:19.080
[Maddie screaming]

- [bones crunching]

33:22.375 --> 33:24.085
[crowd exclaiming]

33:28.172 --> 33:31.551
[Chelsea] We're 10-7 with Badger
from this location. We need transport now.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.011
[agent] Move!

33:34.554 --> 33:35.471
[tires screeching]

33:42.895 --> 33:45.690
What the hell was that?
You let that guy get hands on Maddie.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.693
I slipped. I slipped.
I still got him down though.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.445
It was a goddamn shitshow.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.363
I don't care
how many presidents you saved,

33:52.363 --> 33:54.407
I don't do fuckups on this team.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.744
You know I gotta report this, right?

33:59.704 --> 34:00.788
Do what you gotta do.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.374
[police siren wailing]

34:08.004 --> 34:08.880
Shit.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.424
[suspenseful music playing]

34:16.304 --> 34:17.889
[phone ringing]

34:18.556 --> 34:19.682
Uh, yes, go ahead.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.768
The fries here are amazing.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.068
[knocking on door]

34:30.068 --> 34:31.444
[Peter] Farr, it's Peter.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.075
Hey, uh,
Rose called the Night Action line.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.326
She wants to talk to you.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.148
[Diane] Rose, are you okay?

35:14.278 --> 35:17.281
I'm alive, which is more than I can say
for my aunt and uncle.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.367
[Diane] Where are you?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.870
[Rose] <i>I'm not saying anything,
not until you answer some questions first.</i>

35:22.870 --> 35:24.163
[Diane] I want to help.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.790
I know you're confused.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.001
I also know it's not safe for you
out there by yourself.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.045
What can I say to ease your mind?

35:35.091 --> 35:36.801
[Rose] <i>I want some answers.</i>

35:37.343 --> 35:38.219
[door opening]

35:38.219 --> 35:41.556
I don't have enough of those yet,
but I'll tell you what I can.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.200
[scanner beeping]

36:11.502 --> 36:14.005
"Connect the Wi-Fi adapter
to air gapped computer."

36:17.133 --> 36:19.886
Did Deputy Director Hawkins
have my aunt and uncle murdered?

36:19.886 --> 36:23.139
The FBI is investigating,
but, yes, it seems that way.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.270
And the men who did it,
what do you know about them?

36:29.270 --> 36:32.398
The director has agents
working around the clock looking for them.

36:32.398 --> 36:35.943
<i>Secret Service is assisting,
as is local law enforcement.</i>

36:35.943 --> 36:37.445
We'll find them soon, Rose.

I'm worried about you.</i>

36:47.038 --> 36:49.040
[keyboard clacking]

36:49.040 --> 36:52.001
[Diane] But I can't guarantee your safety
unless you come in.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.128
I promise we can protect you.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.713
Like you did at the hotel?

36:56.839 --> 36:58.841
[mouse clicking]

[Diane] <i>I trusted Hawkins' Secret Service.</i>

37:09.727 --> 37:11.270
<i>I won't make that mistake again.</i>

37:11.270 --> 37:12.980
- [keys clacking]
- Why should I trust you?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.358
[Diane] <i>You trust Peter, right?</i>

37:17.276 --> 37:18.319
Yes.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.987
He trusts me, ergo...

37:21.614 --> 37:22.907
Come on, Rose.

37:29.163 --> 37:29.997
Hurry.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.043
[Diane] <i>I understand why it's hard
for you to trust anyone right now,</i>

37:34.043 --> 37:35.336
<i>but I wanna help you.</i>

37:44.553 --> 37:45.554

37:52.728 --> 37:54.063
Is someone there with you?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.815
No, it's just I...

38:00.903 --> 38:03.364
Tell me where you are.
I'll have Peter pick you up.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.448
I have to go.

38:05.032 --> 38:05.992
Rose, no.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.326
[phone line beeping]

38:08.244 --> 38:09.161

Shit!

39:22.401 --> 39:24.278
Left my badge inside. Help a lady out?

39:24.278 --> 39:25.446
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.447
[scanner beeping]

39:27.948 --> 39:29.533
Anything more on Rose?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.868
No, you're right.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.578
Poor thing's terrified.

39:33.996 --> 39:34.914
Could you trace her?

39:34.914 --> 39:37.666
No, no, no, no.
Uh, she must be using a new burner.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.710
[Diane] Where the hell is my...?

39:45.007 --> 39:46.092
Here it is.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.052
Let me know if she calls back.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.138
Uh, did you hear anything
in the background of the call

39:51.138 --> 39:53.557
that might help us,
you know, figure out where she is?

39:55.476 --> 39:56.852
I heard a door jingle.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.897
Sounded like a diner or something.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.234
I'll have Almora
check with the local police. Thanks.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.151
Yeah.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.074
[sighing heavily]

40:13.869 --> 40:15.287
[keyboard clacking]

40:52.700 --> 40:53.534
Hey.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.495
Thanks.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.623
- [door opening]
- [doobell chiming]

41:02.209 --> 41:03.043
[officer] Miss?

41:03.043 --> 41:04.753
- Oh my God.
- [officer] Hey, miss?

41:05.421 --> 41:06.338
Hey.

41:06.338 --> 41:09.133
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were talking to me.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.886
You left your charger inside.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.180
Oh, uh, thank you.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.974
Um, late night, head's all scrambled.

41:16.974 --> 41:19.268
Do I, uh, do I know you from somewhere?

41:21.437 --> 41:22.438
I don't think so.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.816
I... I don't live here.
I'm just-- I'm passing through.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.110
Yeah.

41:28.694 --> 41:29.820
Thank you.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.071
[officer] Safe travels.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.239
[car door opening]

41:34.200 --> 41:36.202
[tense music playing]

41:50.216 --> 41:51.217
What the fuck?

41:58.432 --> 42:00.643
It's empty, the hard drive.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.228
It's fucking blank.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.273
Do you think that the Campbells
wiped it or something?

42:06.273 --> 42:07.358
Or you did.

42:09.151 --> 42:11.153
- What?
- I found this on the air gap.

42:11.737 --> 42:14.532
I checked. Only badge
scanned into the office was mine,

42:14.532 --> 42:17.201
including once when I was sitting here
speaking to Rose.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.453
When you left to go trace her phone.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.914
They warned me.

42:21.914 --> 42:25.376
They fucking warned me
not to bring you in after your father.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.336
- Wait, what? No.
- I should have listened.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.879
Hold on. Hold on.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.340
You try anything, I'll fucking scream.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.550
I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.009
Are you working with them?

42:34.009 --> 42:35.844
- With who?
- [Diane] What have you done, Peter?

42:36.971 --> 42:38.305
Did you kill Hawkins?

42:38.305 --> 42:40.099
What? No.

42:40.099 --> 42:41.892
Then explain this.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.143
You explain first.

42:43.143 --> 42:45.312
Who sent the killers after us
this morning?

42:45.312 --> 42:46.564
At the cabin?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.108
I called you, only you.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.277
Who gave them our location

42:51.277 --> 42:53.320
if you were the only one
who could've tracked us?

42:59.702 --> 43:00.703
You, come here.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.372
Get this to Tech,
have them scan it for spyware.

43:04.373 --> 43:05.749
- Right now.
- Yes, ma'am.

43:08.794 --> 43:09.962
Okay.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.755
[door closing]

43:11.755 --> 43:13.299
Let's start over.

43:13.882 --> 43:16.135
Maybe I'm an idiot for telling you this,
but what the hell.

43:16.135 --> 43:19.305
If you can't convince me you're
innocent in the next two minutes,

43:19.305 --> 43:22.308
you're gonna be stuck in a supermax prison
for the rest of your life anyway,

43:22.308 --> 43:24.476
so here it is.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.395
There are occasions

43:26.395 --> 43:29.023
when the president can commission
an intelligence investigation

43:29.023 --> 43:30.941
outside the normal chain of command.

43:30.941 --> 43:31.859
Night Action.

43:31.859 --> 43:36.363
Two months ago, POTUS initiated
a Night Action into the metro bombing.

43:37.281 --> 43:39.658
Intelligence had no leads,
no credible suspects,

43:39.658 --> 43:41.285
no possible motives, nothing.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.079
Until that statement leaked
from the People's Independence Front.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.040
Right, but there were doubts.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.001
Omar Zadar, the leader of the PIF,

43:49.668 --> 43:51.337
disavowed the attack.

43:52.087 --> 43:53.756
Claimed the statement was fake.

43:54.256 --> 43:57.259
The CIA spent months
listening in on their leaders.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.804
No mention of the attack, no confirmation.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.640
POTUS felt she wasn't getting
the full story,

44:02.640 --> 44:05.559
so she called on two old friends
from her Senate Intelligence days

44:05.559 --> 44:06.894
to take a new look into it.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.020
The Campbells.

44:08.020 --> 44:12.024
Apparently, they suspected
someone inside the White House

44:12.816 --> 44:15.069
of being involved with the metro bombing.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.320
[tense music playing]

44:16.987 --> 44:17.863
Yeah.

44:19.323 --> 44:21.325
I reacted the same way when I heard.

44:23.118 --> 44:26.080
Okay, so who's the traitor, then? Hawkins?

44:26.080 --> 44:27.081
For my money?

44:27.998 --> 44:30.417
But any assumptions now could be deadly.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.546
As of now, we still don't know for certain
who this person is,

44:34.546 --> 44:36.173
or who else they compromised.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.926
We don't know how
or if they're connected to the PIF.

44:38.926 --> 44:42.346
But clearly, it's someone senior enough
to get spyware on my phone

44:42.346 --> 44:44.515
and to pull Rose's detail off the hotel.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.683
Holy shit.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.601
We need concrete proof though,

44:48.102 --> 44:51.146
which I was praying to find
on that hard drive.

44:51.146 --> 44:53.023
What the fuck were you thinking?

44:53.023 --> 44:54.566
Thought you were trying to kill us.

44:54.566 --> 44:56.735
Peter, I swear on everything I hold holy,

44:56.735 --> 44:59.947
I did not send anyone after you and Rose.

45:01.031 --> 45:04.201
The question now is,
can you still convince me to trust you?

45:13.752 --> 45:15.045
[cell phone vibrating]

45:18.424 --> 45:20.092
- Good evening, sir.
- You called?

45:20.092 --> 45:21.719
[Chelsea] <i>There was an incident tonight.</i>

45:21.719 --> 45:23.429
Someone accosted Badger at a bar.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.556
- Is she okay?
- [Chelsea] <i>Just a couple scratches.</i>

45:25.556 --> 45:26.890
<i>We have two men in custody.</i>

45:26.890 --> 45:28.517
She's shaken up though.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.853
You'll have my full report
later tonight, but, um--

45:30.853 --> 45:31.854
Who fucked up?

45:31.854 --> 45:33.772
[Chelsea] <i>No one, sir. It was just--</i>

45:33.772 --> 45:36.608
Arrington, it's late. I need to get home.

45:36.608 --> 45:39.403
Cut the bullshit
and tell me who fucked up.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.115
Monks was first in.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.993
He should've defused the situation,
but he... he slipped.

45:47.661 --> 45:50.038
Well, let's just give him
a couple days to get settled in.

45:50.038 --> 45:53.542
Sir, he might think he's good to go
after his layoff, but I certainly don't.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.918
[Ben] <i>Before taking that bullet,</i>

45:54.918 --> 45:57.004
Monks was one of the best agents we had.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.757
I learned a ton from him
when we were partners.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.552
I didn't realize you were partners.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.346
<i>Ages ago.
Trust me, he's an asset to your team,</i>

46:06.346 --> 46:08.849
otherwise,
I would have never assigned him.

46:08.849 --> 46:12.311
And who knows?
Maybe you'll learn something from him too.

46:12.311 --> 46:14.188
I like to think
my team's been doing a good job

46:14.188 --> 46:15.981
keeping Badger safe since I took over.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.317
And now, with Monks on the team,

46:18.317 --> 46:20.194
Maddie will be that much safer.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.153
<i>Right?</i>

46:22.112 --> 46:23.030
Right.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.239
[Ben] <i>But keep an eye on him.</i>

46:24.239 --> 46:26.074
I want you to let me know how he's doing.

46:26.784 --> 46:27.743
Okay?

46:28.368 --> 46:29.286
Of course, sir.

46:29.286 --> 46:31.371
[dramatic music playing]

46:36.543 --> 46:38.545
[suspenseful music playing]

46:56.980 --> 46:57.981
[cell phone chiming]

47:05.280 --> 47:07.032
[keypad beeping]

47:12.538 --> 47:13.413
[bag zipping]

47:19.753 --> 47:23.131
Okay. Let's get some fucking answers.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.430
<i>Let's discuss the statement
that leaked recently</i>

47:30.430 --> 47:32.474
<i>claiming credit for the D.C. Metro attack.</i>

47:32.474 --> 47:36.144
<i>We didn't write that statement,
and we didn't orchestrate that attack.</i>

47:36.728 --> 47:40.274
[woman] <i>Right. But it was written
on your party's letterhead</i>

47:40.274 --> 47:43.026
<i>and leaked from a server
in your party's headquarters.</i>

47:43.026 --> 47:45.779
<i>A fake used to discredit us,</i>

47:45.779 --> 47:48.031
<i>because the PIF is climbing in the polls,</i>

47:48.031 --> 47:51.618
<i>and because we represent
the common man and woman here at home.</i>

47:51.618 --> 47:54.621
[woman] <i>You can see why
there are doubts, Mr. Zadar.</i>

47:54.621 --> 47:56.957
<i>The bombing of the government building
attributed to your--</i>

47:56.957 --> 47:58.709
<i>The party is not responsible</i>

47:58.709 --> 48:02.421
<i>for the actions of a handful
of its more extreme followers.</i>

48:03.088 --> 48:04.548
<i>Next question.</i>

48:04.548 --> 48:07.676
[woman] <i>Ten civil servants died
in one of those attacks.</i>

48:08.302 --> 48:09.469
<i>Common men and women.</i>

48:14.433 --> 48:15.475
Well.

48:17.769 --> 48:19.813
Isn't this an unexpected delight?

48:21.481 --> 48:22.941
How's the CIA?

48:22.941 --> 48:25.652
The rest of the world still wants
to kill us, so, you know, it's, uh...

48:26.570 --> 48:27.571
It's busy.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.866
So are we gonna do this again?

48:30.866 --> 48:33.327
Get your mind out of my pants
for 30 seconds.

48:34.119 --> 48:36.246
I need a favor, and you still owe me one.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.958
- Our night together didn't cover that?
<i>-</i> Not even close.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.378
[sniffing]

48:44.296 --> 48:45.380
What kind of favor?

48:45.881 --> 48:47.674
I need to know why a national hero

48:47.674 --> 48:51.219
got assigned to the most thankless detail
in the whole Secret Service.

48:57.768 --> 49:00.604
Heads up,
next class starts in about two minutes.

49:02.356 --> 49:05.067
Oh, I didn't realize we'd finished. Sorry.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.026
[teacher] Don't be.

49:06.026 --> 49:08.779
All great artists
get absorbed in their work.

49:10.030 --> 49:11.365
Let's take a look.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.660
Maddie, let me in.

49:22.250 --> 49:25.087
I took your advice...

49:27.381 --> 49:29.174
drew what was holding me back.

49:30.175 --> 49:32.135
Please tell me
this isn't how you see yourself.

49:32.135 --> 49:33.637
No, it's not me.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.140
It's my father.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.813
It's incredible.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.108
It's everything I knew you had in you.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.610
You've got to paint it, Maddie.

49:53.657 --> 49:54.992
[exhaling] Um,

49:55.701 --> 49:57.577
I should get ready for my next class.

50:07.713 --> 50:09.047
What's with the smile?

50:10.090 --> 50:13.885
Nothing. It just finally feels like
I'm figuring things out with my art.

50:15.095 --> 50:18.181
Oh, by the way, Harper invited me.

50:18.765 --> 50:20.517
She has a couple pieces on display.

50:21.768 --> 50:24.771
Sounds like fun, except the Harper part.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.773
She's not that bad.

50:26.773 --> 50:28.483
We'll scope out the venue today.

50:32.487 --> 50:33.613
What's wrong?

50:34.197 --> 50:35.991
You've got that look
when you have bad news.

50:36.992 --> 50:40.078
Just heard that your dad
plans to stop by to see you tomorrow.

50:40.996 --> 50:44.541
Well, then I should probably schedule
an emergency session with my shrink.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.418
Come on, Maddie. He won't be here long.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.503
You need to figure out a way
to tolerate him.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.548
We'll get through tomorrow, okay?

50:51.548 --> 50:52.507
Together.

I think I found something. Check this out.

Rose, I--

51:47.521 --> 51:48.772
[door closing]

51:48.772 --> 51:51.733
- What the fuck is she doing here?
- She's on our side. I swear.

51:51.733 --> 51:53.360
She's not. She tried to have us killed.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.028
No, I didn't.

51:55.028 --> 51:56.196
I'm here to help you.

51:57.322 --> 51:58.532
Hear her out.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.618
You said you wanted answers.

52:02.452 --> 52:05.080
I'm here to tell you the truth
about your aunt and uncle.
