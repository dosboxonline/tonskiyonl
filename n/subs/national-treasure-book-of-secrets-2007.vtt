01:11.182 --> 01:13.548
[Indistinct chatter]

01:15.920 --> 01:17.820
[Man] He's in the other room.

01:25.763 --> 01:28.425
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.300
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

01:32.637 --> 01:35.663
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

01:36.274 --> 01:40.540
- [Man] It's a coded message.
- [Gates] It's a Playfair cipher.

01:41.779 --> 01:44.543
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

01:44.615 --> 01:47.106
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

01:47.184 --> 01:51.348
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

01:51.422 --> 01:54.789
I believe what you need is right there.

01:54.859 --> 01:56.850
It'll take some time.

01:58.896 --> 02:02.923
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

02:07.305 --> 02:10.035
- [Horse grunts]
- Whoa.

02:25.389 --> 02:28.620
[Man]... calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

02:28.693 --> 02:30.957
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

02:31.028 --> 02:33.019
[Laughter]

02:33.397 --> 02:37.834
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

02:37.902 --> 02:38.891
[Laughter]

02:43.174 --> 02:46.143
[Woman] I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

02:46.310 --> 02:48.778
till I am quite sure of the American.

02:48.846 --> 02:53.613
- [Woman 2] Ah, that's my own girl.
- [Laughter]

02:53.684 --> 02:55.584
Augusta, dear, to your room.

02:59.190 --> 03:04.025
[Man]... to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

[Indistinct chatter]

03:32.189 --> 03:33.884
[Gates] Temples.

03:35.559 --> 03:36.753
Gold.

03:36.927 --> 03:40.294
Cíbola? This is a treasure map.

03:42.099 --> 03:46.126
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

03:46.203 --> 03:48.228
You're all traitors.

03:50.174 --> 03:54.008
- [Man] President Lincoln's been shot!
- [Man 2] Everybody, out! All of you!

03:54.078 --> 03:56.012
[Boy] Killer's on the loose!

03:58.516 --> 04:02.509
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.417
- [Glass shatters]
- [Shouting]

04:06.857 --> 04:08.085
[Grunts]

04:08.159 --> 04:10.457
- Dad!
- The war is over.

04:12.596 --> 04:13.824
No!

04:17.935 --> 04:20.699
- No!
- [Gasping] No!

04:26.043 --> 04:27.772
You're wrong about that.

04:29.180 --> 04:31.478
The war has only just begun!

04:36.754 --> 04:39.655
[Gasping] Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

04:39.723 --> 04:42.521
The debt that all men p... [stammers]

04:44.361 --> 04:45.885
Dad! No, please!

04:51.569 --> 04:54.231
[Sobbing] Come back. It's not fair.

04:55.306 --> 04:57.501
Help! Somebody help, please!

04:59.510 --> 05:01.000
So recapping:

05:01.078 --> 05:05.105
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

05:05.182 --> 05:08.310
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

05:08.385 --> 05:12.947
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

05:13.023 --> 05:15.958
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

05:16.026 --> 05:18.961
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

05:19.029 --> 05:21.395
- Thank you.
- [Applause]

05:23.834 --> 05:26.632
[Man] I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

05:26.704 --> 05:27.693
Thank you.

05:29.273 --> 05:34.040
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

05:34.111 --> 05:35.100
Thank you.

05:36.780 --> 05:39.578
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

05:39.650 --> 05:41.880
had been here to see this wonderful day.

05:41.952 --> 05:44.477
[Man] Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

05:44.555 --> 05:47.353
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

05:47.424 --> 05:50.325
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

05:50.394 --> 05:51.827
Perhaps.

05:52.530 --> 05:55.556
- Perhaps not.
- [Crowd murmuring]

05:55.633 --> 05:59.399
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

05:59.503 --> 06:03.269
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

06:03.807 --> 06:07.265
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

06:07.611 --> 06:09.306
As Silas tells it,

06:09.380 --> 06:13.612
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

06:14.385 --> 06:16.478
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

06:16.554 --> 06:19.455
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

06:19.523 --> 06:22.014
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

06:22.092 --> 06:23.320
[Crowd murmuring]

06:23.394 --> 06:26.261
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

06:27.464 --> 06:31.457
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

06:31.535 --> 06:36.234
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

06:39.743 --> 06:42.837
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

06:42.913 --> 06:46.110
<i>He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.</i>

06:46.183 --> 06:49.710
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.

06:50.421 --> 06:54.414
<i>- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.</i>

06:54.491 --> 06:56.823
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

06:56.927 --> 06:59.794
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

07:03.634 --> 07:07.832
<i>- "Thomas Gates, artifex."
- "Designer"</i>

07:07.905 --> 07:11.272
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.606
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

07:15.679 --> 07:18.671
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

07:19.783 --> 07:22.377
You see that?
Burned out right there.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.055
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

07:26.123 --> 07:28.921
- May I, Mr?
- Wilkinson.

07:28.993 --> 07:31.689
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

07:31.762 --> 07:34.925
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

07:34.999 --> 07:38.560
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

07:38.636 --> 07:41.833
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

07:41.905 --> 07:44.271
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

07:44.341 --> 07:47.777
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

08:00.190 --> 08:03.648
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

08:04.261 --> 08:05.694
It can't be.

08:07.064 --> 08:08.895
Maps to presidents' houses.

08:10.067 --> 08:12.467
Keys to locks that don't exist.

08:13.170 --> 08:16.662
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

08:17.975 --> 08:20.205
Proof, proof, proof.

08:21.712 --> 08:23.043
What proof?

08:43.866 --> 08:47.325
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

08:47.404 --> 08:51.932
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

08:52.009 --> 08:56.503
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

08:56.580 --> 09:00.038
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

09:00.851 --> 09:02.512
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

09:02.586 --> 09:05.282
There's a picture of me right there.

09:07.091 --> 09:09.082
I think it's a pretty good picture.

09:09.159 --> 09:12.458
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

09:12.529 --> 09:16.397
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

09:16.467 --> 09:19.527
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

09:24.108 --> 09:27.305
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

09:29.113 --> 09:32.207
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

09:34.885 --> 09:37.445
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

09:37.521 --> 09:38.715
Hm?

09:42.092 --> 09:43.423
[Laughs]

09:48.398 --> 09:51.094
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

09:52.269 --> 09:55.067
[Wheels squeaking]

09:58.041 --> 09:59.269
Where's the Ferrari?

10:00.611 --> 10:03.671
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

10:03.747 --> 10:08.343
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

10:08.418 --> 10:10.613
on an island that didn't exist

10:10.687 --> 10:13.713
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

10:13.791 --> 10:18.421
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

10:19.863 --> 10:22.388
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

10:22.466 --> 10:24.764
Six million dollars.

10:25.435 --> 10:27.630
But enough about me.

10:27.704 --> 10:30.070
[Sighs] What's new with you?

10:31.175 --> 10:35.009
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

10:35.078 --> 10:38.206
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.117
I need your help.

10:41.351 --> 10:44.411
[Man] I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

10:44.488 --> 10:48.185
[Ben] I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

10:48.258 --> 10:50.385
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

10:50.460 --> 10:53.861
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

10:53.931 --> 10:54.989
All right.

10:55.065 --> 10:59.525
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

11:00.604 --> 11:03.004
- Go.
- [Beeping]

11:05.843 --> 11:11.804
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

11:11.882 --> 11:15.648
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

11:15.719 --> 11:17.118
"So?"

11:17.187 --> 11:20.247
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."

11:20.324 --> 11:24.226
"So, you seem to always know what's
best." "So, I guess I'm invisible."

11:24.294 --> 11:27.058
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

11:27.130 --> 11:28.927
- [beeping]
- [Riley] Oh.

11:28.999 --> 11:33.527
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

11:33.971 --> 11:35.632
You did that in 25 seconds.

11:36.206 --> 11:38.197
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

11:41.044 --> 11:42.773
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.445
[Car approaching]

11:49.887 --> 11:51.878
[Ben] That's not Abigail's car.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.925
[Ben] She was on a date.

11:55.993 --> 11:59.485
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

11:59.596 --> 12:03.293
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

12:03.333 --> 12:04.322
He's weird!

12:04.401 --> 12:07.063
[Abigail] What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

12:07.137 --> 12:09.867
[Man] Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

12:09.940 --> 12:11.202
[Abigail] Pretty much.

12:11.275 --> 12:13.800
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

12:13.877 --> 12:16.903
[Abigail] All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.505
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

12:19.583 --> 12:21.312
Oh, Abigail.

12:21.852 --> 12:25.117
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

12:25.188 --> 12:28.589
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

12:29.359 --> 12:30.883
How did you get in, Ben?

12:34.131 --> 12:36.497
Riley! Come out here!

12:38.969 --> 12:40.561
What? [laughs]

12:42.472 --> 12:46.772
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

12:46.843 --> 12:49.869
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance?

12:49.947 --> 12:52.973
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

12:53.450 --> 12:56.044
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

12:56.119 --> 13:00.681
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

13:00.991 --> 13:02.424
What?

13:02.492 --> 13:05.086
Um, maybe I should go.

13:05.162 --> 13:08.791
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

13:09.466 --> 13:12.094
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

13:12.169 --> 13:13.431
You do?

13:14.638 --> 13:17.368
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

13:17.441 --> 13:20.535
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. [laughs]

13:22.112 --> 13:23.739
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:24.648 --> 13:27.014
I cannot believe you broke in.

13:27.084 --> 13:29.678
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

13:31.254 --> 13:32.448
Hand it over, Ben.

13:32.522 --> 13:35.082
[Sighs] I need to see
the Booth diary page.

13:35.158 --> 13:38.958
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

13:39.029 --> 13:42.829
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

13:42.899 --> 13:46.198
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

13:46.269 --> 13:48.464
It could have been erased or faded.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.996
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

13:52.075 --> 13:54.066
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

13:54.144 --> 13:56.669
That department reports
to your department.

13:56.780 --> 13:59.044
Come on. One look under infrared.

13:59.082 --> 14:01.073
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

14:06.923 --> 14:08.220
Both of them?

14:09.159 --> 14:11.423
[Beeping]

14:11.495 --> 14:14.328
[Riley] We've been looking
at this page for hours.

14:14.398 --> 14:15.990
There's nothing there.

14:16.833 --> 14:21.270
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.772
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

14:23.840 --> 14:27.139
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

14:27.210 --> 14:31.374
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

14:31.481 --> 14:33.472
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

14:33.550 --> 14:38.487
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

14:38.555 --> 14:42.218
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

14:42.292 --> 14:45.955
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.827
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

14:48.899 --> 14:53.666
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

14:56.073 --> 14:57.802
- [Abigail] Ben.
- What?

14:57.908 --> 14:59.273
Look at this.

15:00.510 --> 15:03.035
- See that?
- Oh.

15:03.113 --> 15:07.880
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."

15:08.752 --> 15:10.083
It's nothing.

15:12.956 --> 15:15.823
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

15:16.493 --> 15:18.324
The letters are backwards.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.386
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

15:20.464 --> 15:22.762
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

15:22.833 --> 15:28.601
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

15:28.672 --> 15:33.075
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

15:33.143 --> 15:35.373
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

15:35.445 --> 15:37.743
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

15:37.814 --> 15:40.578
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

15:40.650 --> 15:43.551
[Riley] There's a billion words
in the English language.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.680
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

15:46.756 --> 15:48.314
A. Aardvark.

15:48.391 --> 15:52.384
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

15:52.462 --> 15:56.421
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

15:56.500 --> 16:01.301
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

16:02.672 --> 16:04.333
What if he isn't innocent?

16:05.976 --> 16:07.136
[Beeping]

16:15.051 --> 16:18.680
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

16:18.755 --> 16:20.882
What did he find now? Atlantis?

16:20.957 --> 16:23.653
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

16:23.727 --> 16:25.786
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

16:25.862 --> 16:27.955
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

16:28.031 --> 16:32.058
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

16:32.135 --> 16:35.764
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

16:35.839 --> 16:38.433
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates."

16:38.508 --> 16:42.410
- [Woman] Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

16:42.479 --> 16:46.677
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

16:46.750 --> 16:50.083
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

16:52.055 --> 16:54.421
- Why?
- We'll find out.

16:54.491 --> 16:54.991
Better.

16:54.991 --> 16:55.787
Better.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.957
Bacon.

16:59.362 --> 17:01.057
[Beeping]

17:01.131 --> 17:02.826
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

17:08.070 --> 17:11.097
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

17:12.909 --> 17:15.707
<i>[Nichols] We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family</i>

17:15.779 --> 17:17.473
<i>for coming forth with the page.</i>

17:17.547 --> 17:22.415
<i>On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.</i>

17:22.484 --> 17:26.012
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

17:26.089 --> 17:28.114
[Nichols continues talking]

17:28.191 --> 17:29.522
It's on the Internet!

17:30.360 --> 17:33.796
<i>- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...</i>

17:34.731 --> 17:37.461
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.833
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

17:40.904 --> 17:45.273
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

17:45.342 --> 17:47.173
We have a story. We have nothing.

17:47.244 --> 17:50.771
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

17:50.847 --> 17:53.907
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

17:55.118 --> 17:57.211
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

17:57.320 --> 18:01.882
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. History.

18:01.925 --> 18:04.519
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

18:05.295 --> 18:07.695
You and I both know he burned the page

18:07.764 --> 18:10.255
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.130
That's what we're going to prove.

18:12.202 --> 18:14.693
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

18:14.771 --> 18:18.138
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.904
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

18:20.977 --> 18:25.539
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map."

18:25.615 --> 18:29.676
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

18:29.753 --> 18:33.314
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

18:34.190 --> 18:36.215
- Wait a minute.
- What?

18:39.329 --> 18:41.490
He took his son's hand.

18:41.564 --> 18:45.660
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

18:45.735 --> 18:50.604
- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay"?

18:50.674 --> 18:52.801
The debt that Thomas paid.

18:53.343 --> 18:55.208
That's five letters.

18:55.278 --> 18:56.802
Oh!

18:56.913 --> 18:58.039
Try "Death."

18:58.081 --> 18:59.844
- What?
- It's the keycode.

18:59.916 --> 19:01.747
The debt that all men pay is death.

19:06.489 --> 19:07.547
All right.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.524
[Beeping]

19:09.592 --> 19:12.459
[Riley] L-A-B-O-U-L...

19:12.629 --> 19:15.097
It's Lab-ool...

19:15.165 --> 19:19.363
Lab-ahl... La...

19:19.436 --> 19:20.596
It's gibberish.

19:20.670 --> 19:22.900
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

19:22.972 --> 19:25.600
- What is that?
- It's a who. Édouard Laboulaye.

19:25.675 --> 19:26.699
Where's the phone?

19:26.776 --> 19:29.472
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

19:29.546 --> 19:33.539
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

19:33.616 --> 19:35.447
[Indistinct chatter]

19:36.052 --> 19:37.815
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.048
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

19:40.123 --> 19:42.421
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

19:45.895 --> 19:48.056
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

19:48.131 --> 19:51.931
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

19:52.001 --> 19:54.231
- Any news?
- Well...

19:54.304 --> 19:58.638
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

20:00.710 --> 20:02.268
Take a look.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.846
[Wilkinson] Random letters. A cipher?

20:05.915 --> 20:07.542
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

20:07.617 --> 20:09.676
He's the one that discovered it.

20:09.753 --> 20:10.742
[Cell phone rings]

20:10.820 --> 20:13.288
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

20:15.759 --> 20:18.387
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

20:18.461 --> 20:19.655
Hey. What?

20:19.729 --> 20:22.197
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye."

20:22.265 --> 20:23.994
<i>The cipher spells "Laboulaye."</i>

20:24.067 --> 20:28.094
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

20:28.171 --> 20:31.868
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

20:31.941 --> 20:35.172
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

20:35.245 --> 20:37.406
L-A-D, lad... ladder...

20:37.480 --> 20:39.141
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

20:39.215 --> 20:41.615
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

20:42.352 --> 20:45.719
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

20:45.789 --> 20:48.417
<i>right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?</i>

20:48.491 --> 20:50.618
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

20:50.693 --> 20:53.161
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

20:53.997 --> 20:56.659
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

20:56.766 --> 20:59.428
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

21:00.270 --> 21:04.673
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.801
Laboulaye? As in Édouard Laboulaye?

21:07.877 --> 21:10.471
He seems to believe so, yes.

21:10.547 --> 21:12.947
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

21:13.016 --> 21:16.247
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

21:16.319 --> 21:20.221
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

21:20.290 --> 21:22.155
Did you learn that from my book?

21:25.195 --> 21:27.823
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

21:28.431 --> 21:31.366
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

21:31.434 --> 21:34.733
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

21:34.804 --> 21:39.002
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

21:39.075 --> 21:44.240
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

21:44.314 --> 21:47.477
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

21:47.550 --> 21:48.642
Exactly.

21:49.686 --> 21:51.017
Is there more than one?

21:52.155 --> 21:54.646
There are three, actually, Riley.

21:54.724 --> 21:59.161
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

21:59.262 --> 22:00.730
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

22:00.730 --> 22:02.061
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."

22:18.848 --> 22:21.612
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

22:21.684 --> 22:23.311
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

22:23.386 --> 22:27.413
[Ben] Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

22:27.490 --> 22:30.323
[Riley] Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

22:30.393 --> 22:32.793
No. Believe me, I understand.

22:32.862 --> 22:35.695
[Policeman speaks French]

22:36.499 --> 22:38.558
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

22:39.035 --> 22:41.902
Ah, American, eh?

pleasant morning

22:46.910 --> 22:49.276
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

22:49.345 --> 22:53.645
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

22:53.716 --> 22:55.445
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

22:55.518 --> 22:57.713
[Policeman speaks French]

22:57.820 --> 23:01.051
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that..."

23:01.090 --> 23:04.218
[both] "...no man need
be afraid of another."

23:04.794 --> 23:06.523
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.355
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.498
- I hope you read French.
- May I?

23:16.873 --> 23:22.641
Um..."Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."

23:22.712 --> 23:25.180
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

23:25.248 --> 23:28.149
"...to preserve what we are looking for.

23:28.217 --> 23:32.119
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.

23:32.188 --> 23:35.715
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute."

23:36.059 --> 23:38.721
Let's see. Resolute twins.

23:40.330 --> 23:41.729
Resolute.

23:42.498 --> 23:45.331
Resolute. And then twins.

23:46.102 --> 23:51.039
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

23:51.741 --> 23:54.676
<i>[Laughs] That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.</i>

23:55.612 --> 24:00.072
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

24:00.183 --> 24:05.120
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

24:05.154 --> 24:07.645
When the ship was finally retired,

24:07.724 --> 24:12.684
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

24:12.762 --> 24:15.162
Voilà. Resolute twins.

24:15.231 --> 24:19.565
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

24:19.636 --> 24:21.934
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

24:22.005 --> 24:24.565
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

- OK, so you get the ticket.
- [Laughs] Great.

during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

24:49.132 --> 24:53.398
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

24:54.270 --> 24:57.000
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

24:57.674 --> 25:01.337
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

25:01.411 --> 25:05.643

collector for a good deal of money?

<i>- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?</i>

28:37.226 --> 28:38.955
You're the one making a scene.

28:39.028 --> 28:42.464
- I... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

28:42.531 --> 28:46.160
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

28:46.669 --> 28:50.435
<i>- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.</i>

28:50.506 --> 28:53.373
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

28:53.442 --> 28:56.377
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

28:56.445 --> 28:59.039
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

28:59.148 --> 29:01.139
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

29:01.183 --> 29:05.085
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

29:05.154 --> 29:08.646
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

29:08.724 --> 29:12.592
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

29:12.662 --> 29:14.027
doesn't make it wrong.

29:14.096 --> 29:17.793
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

29:17.867 --> 29:19.562
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

29:19.635 --> 29:21.626
You and your missis, take it outside.

29:21.704 --> 29:25.765
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

29:25.841 --> 29:28.810
You take the missis outside.
I'm staying right here.

29:29.512 --> 29:31.412
- Ben!
- Whee!

29:31.480 --> 29:33.209
- Good afternoon, sir.
- [English accent] Hello.

29:33.282 --> 29:35.750
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

29:35.818 --> 29:38.844
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

29:38.921 --> 29:40.889
Going to arrest a man for that?

29:40.957 --> 29:44.393
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

29:44.460 --> 29:46.052
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

29:46.128 --> 29:47.755
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

29:47.830 --> 29:48.854
- Sir!
- Haggis!

29:48.931 --> 29:52.799
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

29:52.868 --> 29:54.961
Here they are, standing in a row!

29:55.037 --> 29:58.097
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

29:58.174 --> 30:00.665
That was brilliant.

30:01.277 --> 30:05.111
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

30:05.181 --> 30:08.241
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

30:08.317 --> 30:10.444
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

30:10.753 --> 30:13.620
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

30:13.689 --> 30:17.921
- Your mother told me about you.
- [Continued arguing]

30:18.894 --> 30:23.456
- [Man] In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

30:23.532 --> 30:26.695
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

30:27.370 --> 30:29.668
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

30:29.739 --> 30:31.707
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

30:31.774 --> 30:35.039
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

30:35.644 --> 30:37.077
What is going on?

30:37.146 --> 30:41.082
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

30:41.684 --> 30:44.244
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

30:44.320 --> 30:47.050
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

30:47.123 --> 30:49.785
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

30:49.859 --> 30:52.794
Where "I assume I'm right."
Get us out. Which I don't get.

30:52.862 --> 30:55.797
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

30:55.865 --> 30:58.299
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

30:58.401 --> 31:01.393
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

31:02.972 --> 31:04.496
I get lucky a lot.

31:04.974 --> 31:07.101
So where does that leave me, Ben?

31:07.176 --> 31:09.406
You guys are so great together.

31:09.478 --> 31:11.378
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

31:13.416 --> 31:16.817
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

31:18.654 --> 31:20.053
Does that help?

31:20.122 --> 31:24.582
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

31:24.660 --> 31:28.187
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

31:28.264 --> 31:30.824
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.301
<i>- [Riley] Door number one, opening.
- [Buzzing]</i>

31:36.372 --> 31:38.465
OK. Let me try this out.

31:39.508 --> 31:42.636
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

31:42.711 --> 31:44.474
Yes. Thank you.

31:44.547 --> 31:46.174
Ridiculous. You're staying.

31:46.248 --> 31:48.182
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.810
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

31:50.886 --> 31:51.875
[Buzzing]

31:51.954 --> 31:53.819
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

31:54.423 --> 31:57.415
<i>[Riley] You should be near
a service elevator.</i>

31:57.526 --> 31:59.721
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

31:59.762 --> 32:03.789
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

32:03.866 --> 32:06.391
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.069
- No.
- Don't let her go.

32:09.138 --> 32:10.571
- Abigail...
- [clicking]

32:11.674 --> 32:13.665
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

32:15.344 --> 32:16.606
Hold this.

32:22.785 --> 32:25.083
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

32:25.154 --> 32:26.212
Yeah.

32:32.294 --> 32:35.991
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

32:36.866 --> 32:37.855
So?

32:38.501 --> 32:40.696
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

32:41.537 --> 32:44.700
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

32:47.977 --> 32:49.444
Let's go.

32:54.416 --> 32:56.077
<i>[Riley] OK, now turn left.</i>

32:56.952 --> 32:59.682
<i>- Dead end.
- [Riley] I mean right. Go right.</i>

33:05.728 --> 33:09.095
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

33:17.106 --> 33:18.437
Go, go.

33:21.443 --> 33:22.808
[Ben] That's it.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.407
[Abigail] The Resolute desk.

33:27.516 --> 33:28.881
We're looking for...

33:29.985 --> 33:34.786
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

33:38.294 --> 33:39.659
Hey, look at this.

33:42.665 --> 33:47.864
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

33:48.637 --> 33:53.097
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

33:53.175 --> 33:56.269
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

34:04.186 --> 34:05.710
- Oh...
- What?

34:06.822 --> 34:11.384
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.987
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

34:15.931 --> 34:17.023
What about a year?

34:17.099 --> 34:21.831
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

34:21.904 --> 34:23.735
So you go one...

34:26.675 --> 34:27.664
Eight.

34:32.715 --> 34:33.739
One.

34:37.886 --> 34:38.944
Nine.

34:40.789 --> 34:44.485
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

34:44.560 --> 34:46.891
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.</i>

34:47.429 --> 34:48.418
One.

34:50.766 --> 34:51.994
Eight.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.299
Seven.

35:01.076 --> 35:02.407
Six.

35:29.138 --> 35:30.127
[Ben] Uh-oh.

35:30.739 --> 35:31.933
New rules.

35:32.808 --> 35:36.073
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

35:36.145 --> 35:38.375
I have never seen any symbols like this.

35:38.447 --> 35:43.817
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

35:43.886 --> 35:45.285
What do you think it means?

35:45.354 --> 35:48.881
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

35:48.957 --> 35:50.117
[Beeping]

35:51.527 --> 35:52.687
Uh-oh.

35:52.761 --> 35:55.059
<i>Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.</i>

36:00.703 --> 36:04.935
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

36:05.374 --> 36:08.002
- [Beeping]
- [Alarm wailing]

36:09.545 --> 36:10.944
The fire alarm's gone off.

36:11.013 --> 36:13.072
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

36:14.116 --> 36:16.050
<i>[Man] All units, go to action zebra.</i>

36:16.118 --> 36:18.211
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

36:18.287 --> 36:20.721
- [Indistinct chatter]
- [Alarm blaring]

36:20.789 --> 36:24.384
Someone or something is causing this.

36:24.460 --> 36:27.725
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

36:27.796 --> 36:31.061
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

36:46.915 --> 36:51.045
[Man] This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.749
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

36:54.823 --> 37:00.159
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

37:03.098 --> 37:05.066
[Siren wailing]

37:17.980 --> 37:21.143
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

37:21.216 --> 37:22.774
I'm a little bit allergic.

37:22.851 --> 37:25.012
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

37:25.087 --> 37:28.420
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

37:29.425 --> 37:32.053
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

37:33.562 --> 37:34.961
Daniel, hold it.

37:37.466 --> 37:38.797
What is that?

37:38.867 --> 37:41.563
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

37:41.637 --> 37:44.299
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

37:44.873 --> 37:46.602
It's an incredible discovery.

37:47.776 --> 37:51.678
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

37:53.615 --> 37:56.243
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

37:59.922 --> 38:01.014
We're in England.

38:08.063 --> 38:09.394
[Ben] It's a gun! Get down!

38:12.267 --> 38:15.964
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

38:27.416 --> 38:28.508
Hey, who are you?

38:44.533 --> 38:45.625
[Abigail] Sorry.

38:48.637 --> 38:50.867
- Hey!
- Oi!

38:57.112 --> 39:00.343
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

39:03.185 --> 39:04.618
Whoa!

39:06.154 --> 39:08.247
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

39:15.330 --> 39:16.627
Turn, turn!

39:17.633 --> 39:18.622
Watch out!

39:25.240 --> 39:26.366
Everybody OK?

39:31.647 --> 39:34.707
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

39:39.321 --> 39:40.447
Look out!

39:41.223 --> 39:42.212
Ah!

39:50.799 --> 39:51.959
Ah!

40:14.156 --> 40:15.487
Go. Go, go, go, go!

40:18.160 --> 40:19.650
Did you see where he went?

40:21.730 --> 40:24.096
[Phone rings]

40:24.166 --> 40:27.397
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

40:27.469 --> 40:30.700
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

40:30.772 --> 40:32.967
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

40:33.041 --> 40:36.067
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

40:36.144 --> 40:37.441
Tell that to my father.

40:40.215 --> 40:43.241
- [Man] Moron!
- [Honking]

40:43.318 --> 40:45.809
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

40:45.887 --> 40:47.787
- [Honking]
- [Screaming]

40:48.123 --> 40:51.058
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

40:54.830 --> 40:56.798
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

40:59.334 --> 41:01.268
- Get out of the way!
- [Honking]

41:03.238 --> 41:06.639
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- [Abigail] Watch the people!

41:15.283 --> 41:16.910
Go! Go! Faster!

41:29.531 --> 41:31.396
- Right over there.
- I got them.

41:32.734 --> 41:35.532
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

41:35.604 --> 41:39.096
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

41:43.278 --> 41:45.303
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.541
- [Honking]
- Ah! Ah!

41:56.024 --> 41:59.983
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

42:00.095 --> 42:02.723
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

42:02.764 --> 42:05.631
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

42:05.701 --> 42:08.261
[Laughs] Why, thank you, Riley.

42:31.359 --> 42:32.485
Get it!

42:35.664 --> 42:36.858
Stop! Stop!

42:57.886 --> 42:59.751
- He's got it.
- What is it?

42:59.821 --> 43:00.322
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

43:00.322 --> 43:02.222
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

43:10.799 --> 43:13.461
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.627
Nice to see you two together again.

43:16.705 --> 43:18.900
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

43:18.974 --> 43:22.432
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

43:31.553 --> 43:35.614
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

43:35.690 --> 43:39.182
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

43:39.261 --> 43:42.662
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

43:46.601 --> 43:49.434
I can identify one symbol.

43:49.971 --> 43:52.565
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

43:52.641 --> 43:54.609
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

43:55.076 --> 43:57.636
That symbol is Cíbola.

43:58.446 --> 43:59.572
That's Cíbola.

44:01.082 --> 44:02.982
The City of Gold.

44:03.585 --> 44:04.847
The City of Gold.

44:07.823 --> 44:11.850
[Ben] "In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

44:11.927 --> 44:13.792
There were only four survivors.

44:13.862 --> 44:18.856
One was a slave named Estebán
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

44:18.934 --> 44:21.767
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

44:21.837 --> 44:23.737
a city built from solid gold.

44:25.707 --> 44:29.768
Later, when Estebán tried to find
the city again, he never could.

44:29.845 --> 44:35.477
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

44:36.418 --> 44:40.377
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

44:40.455 --> 44:44.892
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."

44:50.532 --> 44:55.265
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

44:56.004 --> 44:57.471
My God.

44:58.406 --> 44:59.998
I'm going to go talk to her.

45:03.879 --> 45:06.279
- You're coming with me.
- No!

45:06.348 --> 45:10.614
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

45:10.685 --> 45:12.050
There are several others.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.452
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

45:14.522 --> 45:17.514
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

45:17.592 --> 45:20.789
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

45:22.464 --> 45:23.692
That long?

45:24.432 --> 45:28.129
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

45:28.203 --> 45:30.899
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

45:31.573 --> 45:35.407
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

45:35.477 --> 45:37.877
- Who?
- His mom.

45:40.849 --> 45:44.979
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

45:45.053 --> 45:48.819
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

45:49.658 --> 45:51.057
I hate her!

45:53.061 --> 45:54.585
We're in the right place.

45:57.732 --> 46:00.895
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

46:00.969 --> 46:02.800
- [Ben] Hi, Mom.
- [Woman] Benjamin!

46:02.871 --> 46:06.034
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

46:06.107 --> 46:07.096
Hi.

46:08.343 --> 46:09.332
Oh.

46:11.046 --> 46:14.538
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

46:14.616 --> 46:16.481
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

46:16.551 --> 46:19.418
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

46:19.487 --> 46:22.479
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

46:22.557 --> 46:25.526
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

46:25.593 --> 46:29.723
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

46:29.798 --> 46:32.892
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

46:32.968 --> 46:36.165
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

46:36.237 --> 46:39.604
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

46:39.674 --> 46:42.734
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

46:42.811 --> 46:44.904
You thought it had secret stitching.

46:44.980 --> 46:47.414
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

46:47.482 --> 46:50.849
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

46:53.154 --> 46:55.145
I need you to take a look at this.

46:56.324 --> 46:58.849
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.451
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

47:02.731 --> 47:05.256
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

47:05.333 --> 47:08.496
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

47:09.237 --> 47:10.829
Yes, of course you were.

47:13.675 --> 47:17.008
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

47:17.078 --> 47:19.876
Mom, this is actually very important.

47:21.850 --> 47:24.284
All right. What have we got here?

47:25.020 --> 47:29.719
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...

47:35.663 --> 47:36.789
Uh, "noble bird."

47:36.865 --> 47:40.062
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

47:40.135 --> 47:43.400
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."

47:46.307 --> 47:48.400
[Laughs]

47:50.111 --> 47:53.274
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cíbola, don't you?

47:53.815 --> 47:55.680
Well, that is exactly what it is.

47:55.750 --> 47:59.880
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cíbola."
It means "the center of the world."

47:59.988 --> 48:03.856
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

48:03.892 --> 48:07.623
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

48:07.695 --> 48:09.492
- [Ben] Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

48:09.564 --> 48:13.091
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

48:13.168 --> 48:15.329
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

48:15.403 --> 48:17.701
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

48:17.772 --> 48:22.675
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

48:25.313 --> 48:26.974
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

48:27.682 --> 48:31.880
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

48:33.021 --> 48:34.283
I'm sorry.

48:35.090 --> 48:36.557
Not that I'm surprised.

48:38.626 --> 48:41.117
[Ben] At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

48:41.763 --> 48:43.094
What?

48:43.598 --> 48:45.930
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.662
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

48:52.340 --> 48:55.241
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

48:55.310 --> 48:56.800
So where is it?

48:56.911 --> 49:01.507
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."

49:01.549 --> 49:05.076
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

49:05.153 --> 49:08.680
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

49:08.756 --> 49:10.656
President's desk?

49:11.292 --> 49:13.055
The president. What president?

49:13.128 --> 49:16.063
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

49:16.131 --> 49:17.655
But that means...

49:17.732 --> 49:19.063
Wait, so we have to...

49:20.368 --> 49:21.528
The White House?

49:22.871 --> 49:26.398
The Oval Office... to be exact.

49:29.010 --> 49:30.807
Why would I overreact to that?

49:35.483 --> 49:39.317
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

49:41.456 --> 49:42.445
Thank you.

49:46.394 --> 49:48.385
[Nichols] It's early, pre-Columbian.

49:48.463 --> 49:50.727
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

49:50.798 --> 49:54.097
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

49:54.169 --> 49:56.967
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

49:57.038 --> 49:58.437
Where are we to find them?

49:59.140 --> 50:02.507
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

50:02.577 --> 50:03.566
What do you mean?

50:04.312 --> 50:07.873
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

50:07.949 --> 50:11.119
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

50:11.119 --> 50:14.054
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

50:14.389 --> 50:18.792
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.055
Look at this. Look.

50:21.129 --> 50:22.994
Small door on the front of the desk.

50:23.064 --> 50:26.522
[Patrick] FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

50:26.601 --> 50:29.502
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

50:31.339 --> 50:32.772
[Abigail] This could work.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.571
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

50:37.946 --> 50:39.106
I think you're right.

50:41.082 --> 50:45.644
<i>[Man] We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

50:45.720 --> 50:49.816
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

50:51.292 --> 50:54.853
- [Ben] That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

50:54.929 --> 50:58.057
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

50:58.166 --> 50:59.793
Yeah, I love it.

51:01.336 --> 51:05.534
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

51:05.607 --> 51:07.973
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

51:08.042 --> 51:10.203
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

51:10.278 --> 51:13.714
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

51:13.781 --> 51:16.147
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

51:16.217 --> 51:19.186
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

51:19.254 --> 51:22.382
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

51:22.457 --> 51:25.858
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

51:25.927 --> 51:29.454
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

51:29.530 --> 51:32.499
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

51:32.567 --> 51:35.730
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

51:35.803 --> 51:38.772
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

51:40.408 --> 51:42.968
What is going on
with the education in America?

51:43.044 --> 51:46.013
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

51:46.080 --> 51:48.548
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

51:48.616 --> 51:51.176
...with Gates.
- Connor.

51:51.252 --> 51:53.311
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

51:57.292 --> 51:58.884
Aren't you going to ask him?

51:58.960 --> 52:00.450
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

52:00.528 --> 52:03.656
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

52:04.165 --> 52:08.864
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

52:08.936 --> 52:12.064
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

52:12.140 --> 52:16.008
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

52:17.945 --> 52:19.207
- I can do that.
- Really?

52:19.280 --> 52:20.269
You see?

52:20.915 --> 52:22.246
- You can?
- Yeah.

52:22.317 --> 52:26.617
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

52:26.688 --> 52:28.349
Connor rocks.

52:29.023 --> 52:32.049
Well... here we are.

52:32.126 --> 52:34.492
- Mm.
- Wow.

52:34.929 --> 52:39.195
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

52:39.267 --> 52:41.098
Hm.

52:41.169 --> 52:44.070
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

52:44.138 --> 52:47.130
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

52:47.208 --> 52:48.334
Oh. Sorry.

52:50.978 --> 52:54.607
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

52:55.283 --> 52:58.343
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

52:58.453 --> 53:01.013
playing underneath
while his father was working.

53:01.055 --> 53:02.955
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

53:03.024 --> 53:05.925
But many people don't know

53:05.993 --> 53:09.451
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

53:09.530 --> 53:11.555
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

53:11.632 --> 53:13.896
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

53:13.968 --> 53:16.903
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

53:16.971 --> 53:18.438
And Ford, of course.

53:18.573 --> 53:21.007
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

53:21.075 --> 53:23.100
- No.
- Yes.

53:23.177 --> 53:25.907
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

53:26.781 --> 53:29.614
Oh! I... I did, yes.

53:29.684 --> 53:32.949
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

53:33.020 --> 53:36.820
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

53:36.891 --> 53:39.826
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

53:39.894 --> 53:41.259
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

53:41.329 --> 53:43.627
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

53:43.698 --> 53:46.929
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

53:47.001 --> 53:48.332
and check it out?

53:50.104 --> 53:52.038
I'll check over here.

54:01.015 --> 54:03.575
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

54:10.191 --> 54:13.627
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

54:21.702 --> 54:23.363
Oh, no.

54:28.709 --> 54:32.543
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

54:37.919 --> 54:39.580
Connor!

54:39.654 --> 54:43.818
- You found it.
- I did.

54:53.734 --> 54:55.725
Thank you so much!

54:56.170 --> 54:57.637
Uh...

54:58.473 --> 55:01.271
You're just the best. Mm.

55:05.313 --> 55:06.405
Mm!

55:11.986 --> 55:13.317
Mm!

55:14.121 --> 55:15.383
Mm!

55:16.657 --> 55:18.955
- [Clears throat]
- [Moaning]

55:20.061 --> 55:21.221
[Panting] Thank you.

55:24.465 --> 55:24.632
OK.

55:24.632 --> 55:25.462
OK.

55:28.035 --> 55:30.299
- [Ben] Empty.
- [Abigail] Someone must've taken it.

55:30.371 --> 55:33.966
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

55:34.041 --> 55:36.168
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

55:36.244 --> 55:39.736
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

55:39.814 --> 55:41.714
It's not the presidential seal.

55:41.782 --> 55:45.445
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.421
- [Ben] I'm not sure what this is.
- [Patrick] What do we do?

55:48.489 --> 55:50.081
Did none of you read my book?

55:51.993 --> 55:54.257
The eagle clutching the scroll.

55:54.629 --> 55:56.426
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

55:56.497 --> 55:58.624
But it's not something I could tell you.

55:59.700 --> 56:03.636
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

56:09.944 --> 56:13.641
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

56:13.714 --> 56:15.272
Chapter 13.

56:20.087 --> 56:24.353
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."

56:24.425 --> 56:28.589
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

56:28.663 --> 56:32.064
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

56:32.466 --> 56:35.867
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

56:35.937 --> 56:40.374
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

56:41.075 --> 56:45.171
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

56:45.246 --> 56:49.205
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

56:49.283 --> 56:52.411
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

56:52.486 --> 56:55.421
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

56:56.457 --> 56:57.651
It's just totally...

56:57.758 --> 56:58.986
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

56:59.026 --> 57:03.827
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

57:03.898 --> 57:07.061
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

57:08.669 --> 57:09.693
Same symbol.

57:09.770 --> 57:13.171
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.969
The eagle and the scroll,

57:15.042 --> 57:19.308
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

57:19.380 --> 57:22.178
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

57:22.249 --> 57:25.150
is now in the President's Secret Book?

57:27.455 --> 57:28.854
[Riley] Ben.

57:29.523 --> 57:31.616
If it was you trying to convince me...

57:32.526 --> 57:36.121
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

57:40.835 --> 57:42.564
The eagle with the scroll?

57:44.939 --> 57:47.339
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

57:47.408 --> 57:50.275
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

57:50.344 --> 57:51.936
You bought Riley's book.

57:52.013 --> 57:55.414
[Laughs] Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

57:55.483 --> 57:57.951
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

57:58.052 --> 58:00.452
Does the president have a secret book?

58:07.361 --> 58:08.623
Do you like ducks?

58:10.097 --> 58:11.689
[Quacking]

58:12.099 --> 58:13.293
There is a book.

58:14.835 --> 58:16.632
Why are you telling me out here?

58:17.805 --> 58:20.273
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

58:20.341 --> 58:22.605
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

58:22.677 --> 58:27.080
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

58:27.148 --> 58:29.742
The book is passed
from president to president,

58:29.817 --> 58:32.081
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

58:32.153 --> 58:34.178
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

58:34.255 --> 58:37.816
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

58:38.859 --> 58:40.258
Well, you never know.

58:42.129 --> 58:44.359
All I need is a few minutes with him.

58:45.232 --> 58:47.029
A few minutes? Really?

58:47.101 --> 58:49.331
Even if you were married
to the president,

58:49.403 --> 58:51.667
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

58:51.739 --> 58:54.731
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

58:54.809 --> 58:57.107
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

58:57.211 --> 59:00.305
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

59:00.648 --> 59:04.140
People used to say,
"The United States are."

59:04.719 --> 59:09.520
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."

59:11.358 --> 59:15.920
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

59:15.996 --> 59:18.157
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

59:18.232 --> 59:20.723
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

59:21.869 --> 59:23.131
With his life.

59:24.605 --> 59:28.598
So how am I gonna get him alone?

59:32.313 --> 59:33.575
I'm gonna kidnap him.

59:35.216 --> 59:38.208
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

59:40.187 --> 59:41.814
[Laughs]

59:41.889 --> 59:43.982
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

59:44.058 --> 59:47.289
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

59:47.361 --> 59:49.352
Are you out of your mind?

59:49.430 --> 59:52.490
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

59:52.566 --> 59:54.966
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

59:56.303 --> 59:58.005
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

59:58.005 --> 59:59.199
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

59:59.273 --> 01:00:01.468
- What?
- I'm in.

01:00:01.642 --> 01:00:04.406
[Man] Sir, we have to move the party.

01:00:04.545 --> 01:00:07.378
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

01:00:07.448 --> 01:00:09.939
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

01:00:10.017 --> 01:00:13.475
<i>- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.</i>

01:00:13.554 --> 01:00:17.650
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

01:00:17.725 --> 01:00:20.853
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

01:00:20.928 --> 01:00:23.590
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

01:00:23.664 --> 01:00:27.361
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

01:00:27.434 --> 01:00:32.462
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.304
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

01:00:35.376 --> 01:00:37.640
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

01:00:37.711 --> 01:00:41.078
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

01:00:41.148 --> 01:00:45.312
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

01:00:45.386 --> 01:00:48.583
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

01:00:48.656 --> 01:00:50.851
Book it before someone else does.

01:00:52.393 --> 01:00:55.487
[Cheering, applause]

01:00:55.563 --> 01:00:58.157
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

01:00:58.265 --> 01:01:00.563
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

01:01:35.703 --> 01:01:38.228
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

01:01:38.305 --> 01:01:41.741
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:49.947
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

01:01:50.017 --> 01:01:53.612
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

01:01:53.687 --> 01:01:58.556
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.697
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

01:02:11.105 --> 01:02:14.802
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

01:02:37.431 --> 01:02:38.921
I've got no game tonight.

01:02:45.739 --> 01:02:49.835
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:53.937
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

01:02:54.014 --> 01:02:58.144
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...

01:02:58.252 --> 01:02:59.810
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

01:02:59.853 --> 01:03:03.584
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

01:03:03.657 --> 01:03:06.922
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

01:03:06.994 --> 01:03:11.328
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

01:03:11.398 --> 01:03:15.266
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

01:03:15.336 --> 01:03:16.667
Sir?

01:03:16.737 --> 01:03:18.796
Considering your discovered lineage.

01:03:18.872 --> 01:03:21.397
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:24.672
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

01:03:24.745 --> 01:03:28.738
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:30.374
Have a look at that.

01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:34.046
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

01:03:34.121 --> 01:03:36.988
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

01:03:37.057 --> 01:03:40.823
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

01:03:40.894 --> 01:03:42.691
It belonged to my great uncle.

01:03:42.763 --> 01:03:44.890
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

01:03:44.965 --> 01:03:48.264
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:51.896
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

01:03:51.972 --> 01:03:55.339
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

01:03:55.409 --> 01:03:59.675
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.409
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

01:04:04.418 --> 01:04:06.579
- Well...
- [laughs]

01:04:06.653 --> 01:04:10.350
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.649
Are we allowed to do that?

01:04:13.027 --> 01:04:16.428
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

01:04:16.497 --> 01:04:17.759
Can I come with you?

01:04:19.366 --> 01:04:22.062
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:22.136 --> 01:04:24.661
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

01:04:26.273 --> 01:04:28.537
According to this map, it should be...

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:33.603
It's one... two. In here.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.307
Yeah, should be in here.

01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:38.346
- May I?
- Absolutely.

01:04:38.419 --> 01:04:39.909
All right.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.726
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

01:04:46.794 --> 01:04:48.785
but I have no enemies down here.

01:04:49.596 --> 01:04:52.622
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

01:04:53.934 --> 01:04:55.401
I'll just wait here, then.

01:05:06.346 --> 01:05:07.870
[Ben] Over here.

01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:15.153
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

01:05:15.222 --> 01:05:18.783
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

01:05:19.726 --> 01:05:25.562
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:27.923
[Clanking]

01:05:31.772 --> 01:05:32.966

The arrowhead...

01:05:38.312 --> 01:05:40.075
...is sideways.

01:05:47.821 --> 01:05:49.880
[President] We're all right.
Don't worry.

01:05:55.295 --> 01:05:56.592
Look at that.

01:05:57.397 --> 01:05:58.386
Come on.

01:06:04.638 --> 01:06:05.627
Mr. President?

01:06:07.207 --> 01:06:09.767
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

01:06:11.879 --> 01:06:16.179
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:19.819
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

01:06:19.887 --> 01:06:23.618
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:26.488
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

01:06:27.261 --> 01:06:30.753
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

01:06:32.299 --> 01:06:34.290
Tom, alert the vice president.

01:06:35.502 --> 01:06:38.096
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

01:06:38.172 --> 01:06:41.266
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:45.835
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

01:06:45.913 --> 01:06:49.679
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.517
A treasure map to Cíbola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

01:06:54.588 --> 01:06:56.920
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

01:06:57.024 --> 01:07:00.391
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

01:07:00.427 --> 01:07:04.693
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

01:07:04.765 --> 01:07:06.289
You've been in my desk too?

01:07:06.366 --> 01:07:09.426
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:12.295
...in the President's Book, sir.

01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:17.301
The book known only to our presidents.

01:07:18.412 --> 01:07:20.903
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

01:07:21.949 --> 01:07:23.507
[Laughs]

01:07:25.719 --> 01:07:28.449
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:34.392
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

01:07:35.963 --> 01:07:38.454
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:41.899
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

01:07:41.969 --> 01:07:43.800
and I'll show you.

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.929
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

01:07:46.974 --> 01:07:48.202
No, sir.

01:07:48.842 --> 01:07:50.002
Mr. President!

01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:51.772
Where are my sledgehammers?

01:07:57.651 --> 01:07:58.913
I don't get you, Gates.

01:07:59.052 --> 01:08:01.816
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

01:08:01.888 --> 01:08:04.186
just to clear your ancestor's name.

01:08:04.891 --> 01:08:07.325
The way out is just down those stairs.

01:08:08.528 --> 01:08:11.497
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

01:08:12.299 --> 01:08:15.063
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.729
to his country to stop the KGC.

01:08:17.804 --> 01:08:21.604
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

01:08:21.675 --> 01:08:23.540
"Last full measure of devotion"?

01:08:24.211 --> 01:08:27.078
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:31.648
None taken. He's my favorite too.

01:08:33.453 --> 01:08:36.649
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

01:08:36.723 --> 01:08:40.090
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:43.423
Even if something like that
really did exist,

01:08:43.497 --> 01:08:46.398
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.865
Because it will probably lead us

01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:53.031
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

01:08:53.674 --> 01:08:56.666
A huge piece of culture lost.

01:08:56.777 --> 01:08:59.837
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:04.078
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:09.020
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

01:09:09.089 --> 01:09:11.990
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

01:09:12.658 --> 01:09:15.594
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:19.997
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:23.526
They want to believe it.

01:09:26.973 --> 01:09:30.602
[Grunting]

01:09:42.823 --> 01:09:45.656
[Owl hooting]

01:09:45.725 --> 01:09:50.560
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

01:09:55.535 --> 01:09:57.935
- Gates.
- Sir?

01:09:58.004 --> 01:10:01.064
The following conversation
never happened.

01:10:02.442 --> 01:10:03.909
The book exists.

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:07.512
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:09.412
In the Library of Congress.

01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:14.849
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:16.212
Thank you, sir.

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:22.093
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

01:10:22.162 --> 01:10:23.459
Got it.

01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:28.160
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

01:10:28.702 --> 01:10:33.537
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:35.939
Unless you find what you're looking for,

01:10:36.009 --> 01:10:38.807
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.

01:10:38.879 --> 01:10:43.248
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.783
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

OK.

- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:37.204 --> 01:11:38.569
We're close.

01:11:48.648 --> 01:11:52.140
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:55.711
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

01:11:55.789 --> 01:11:58.758
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

01:12:21.715 --> 01:12:22.704
This will be good.

Three-seven-nine-four.

01:12:46.473 --> 01:12:48.771
What did the president say
the number was?

01:12:48.842 --> 01:12:51.037
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

01:12:59.119 --> 01:13:01.144

- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, 78...

It's not there.

01:13:12.299 --> 01:13:14.961
[Riley] Maybe someone checked it out.

01:13:16.603 --> 01:13:20.767
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

01:13:53.073 --> 01:13:54.973
The location is the combination.

01:13:56.309 --> 01:13:58.106

Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

01:15:12.318 --> 01:15:15.947
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

to contain a Playfair cipher

Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

in order to protect the City of Gold.

01:16:15.415 --> 01:16:18.043

and heads to the Library of Congress?

01:16:45.478 --> 01:16:48.106

- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."

That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:26.142
Right.

01:22:29.424 --> 01:22:33.827
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."

01:22:38.399 --> 01:22:39.457
That's it?

01:22:47.075 --> 01:22:51.409
Did it ever occur to you?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

01:22:52.613 --> 01:22:56.549
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.188
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

01:23:03.257 --> 01:23:06.590
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:08.652
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:13.990
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

01:23:16.604 --> 01:23:18.162
No, of course not.

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:20.470

Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

You don't know Benjamin.

01:23:50.605 --> 01:23:54.166
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

was partial to the Confederate cause.

the message I gave your father.

01:25:25.399 --> 01:25:28.368
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

01:25:28.436 --> 01:25:32.167
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.506
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

01:25:36.577 --> 01:25:38.602
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

01:25:38.679 --> 01:25:40.806
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

01:25:40.882 --> 01:25:43.612
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

01:25:43.851 --> 01:25:46.752
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

01:25:46.821 --> 01:25:49.187
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

01:25:49.257 --> 01:25:52.124
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

01:25:55.196 --> 01:25:56.663
I'm afraid he's burned it.

01:25:59.967 --> 01:26:04.666
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

01:26:05.306 --> 01:26:08.639
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:11.940
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

01:26:12.013 --> 01:26:13.913
- What?
- I'm going with you.

01:26:13.981 --> 01:26:17.747
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

01:26:17.818 --> 01:26:19.080
it's going to be me.

01:26:19.153 --> 01:26:22.247
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

01:26:22.323 --> 01:26:23.984
What makes you think I'd agree?

01:26:24.892 --> 01:26:29.420
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

01:26:34.001 --> 01:26:36.231
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:43.008
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

01:26:47.949 --> 01:26:51.749
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

01:27:05.066 --> 01:27:08.729
[Abigail] I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:12.639
All right. Let's have it.

01:27:12.707 --> 01:27:17.144
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

01:27:17.211 --> 01:27:22.513
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."

01:27:22.583 --> 01:27:24.175
Figure that one out.

01:27:24.251 --> 01:27:27.880
So we come back when it's raining?

01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:33.724
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.

01:27:34.395 --> 01:27:37.387
You need a sunny day... and rain.

01:27:38.766 --> 01:27:39.755
We need water.

01:27:40.501 --> 01:27:41.661
Water.

01:27:52.313 --> 01:27:53.439
Abigail.

01:27:54.615 --> 01:27:58.051
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

01:27:58.119 --> 01:27:59.347
Em? Water?

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:03.516
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

01:28:15.569 --> 01:28:18.800
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

01:28:28.449 --> 01:28:29.916
That's it.

01:28:29.984 --> 01:28:34.580
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:37.917
Look at this!

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.518
It's an eagle.

01:28:42.496 --> 01:28:45.124
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

01:28:45.566 --> 01:28:48.364
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."

01:28:48.436 --> 01:28:51.928
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

01:28:52.039 --> 01:28:56.908
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

01:28:58.045 --> 01:29:01.572
- [Patrick] It indicates direction...
- [Riley] Somehow that bird...

01:29:01.649 --> 01:29:05.483
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

01:29:05.553 --> 01:29:09.785
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

01:29:11.058 --> 01:29:13.959
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."

01:29:15.496 --> 01:29:17.828
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

01:29:23.237 --> 01:29:25.432
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

01:29:25.506 --> 01:29:28.202
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

01:29:28.275 --> 01:29:29.833
It's a horrible trap.

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:33.539
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

01:29:34.882 --> 01:29:36.247
I'll do it, Ben.

01:29:36.884 --> 01:29:37.873
It's OK.

01:29:42.423 --> 01:29:44.288
Surrender your hand.

01:29:56.137 --> 01:29:58.128
[Screaming]

01:29:58.906 --> 01:30:01.238
[Laughing]

01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:04.402
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

01:30:06.647 --> 01:30:10.105
It, uh... feels like a latch.

01:30:12.219 --> 01:30:14.619
[Crackling]

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.654
Look at this.

01:30:32.606 --> 01:30:35.336
All right, good. Let's go.

01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:57.321
[Emily] Oh!

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:03.136
Ben, look at this.

01:31:04.038 --> 01:31:06.199
Oh, that's beautiful!

01:31:09.977 --> 01:31:13.037
- Patrick. Patrick!
- [Abigail] Ben, what is that?

01:31:13.113 --> 01:31:16.105
[Ben] Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

01:31:16.183 --> 01:31:18.276
- [Riley] What is that sound?
- [Groaning]

01:31:18.352 --> 01:31:19.683
[Emily] Fascinating.

01:31:20.721 --> 01:31:22.416
[Riley shouting]

01:31:23.324 --> 01:31:25.519
- [Gasping]
- Ah!

01:31:25.593 --> 01:31:26.651
Ben!

01:31:37.104 --> 01:31:38.401
[Riley] Sorry.

01:31:38.472 --> 01:31:40.064
- You OK?
- No.

01:31:40.541 --> 01:31:41.530
Get up.

01:31:43.377 --> 01:31:44.366
It's locked.

01:31:44.445 --> 01:31:49.212
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

01:31:49.283 --> 01:31:51.251
Only one way out of here now.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.548
Forward.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.229
[Emily gasps] Oh!

01:32:07.101 --> 01:32:09.535
Never seen so many relics.

01:32:09.603 --> 01:32:11.696
So beautifully preserved.

01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:17.704
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

01:32:17.778 --> 01:32:21.214
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

01:32:24.251 --> 01:32:25.775
It's a little golden man.

01:32:28.389 --> 01:32:33.224
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

01:32:37.197 --> 01:32:38.425
[shouting]

01:32:46.373 --> 01:32:48.170
- Ben!
- Ben!

01:32:53.914 --> 01:32:57.179
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.246
Back up! Back up!

01:33:02.089 --> 01:33:03.249
Ah!

01:33:07.628 --> 01:33:09.596
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

01:33:10.731 --> 01:33:12.198
No, back up, back up.

01:33:14.368 --> 01:33:16.427
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.837
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

01:33:27.014 --> 01:33:29.073
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:31.879
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

01:33:31.952 --> 01:33:34.318
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

01:33:34.388 --> 01:33:37.221
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

01:33:37.291 --> 01:33:41.557
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

01:33:41.628 --> 01:33:43.755
That is a good idea.

01:33:47.301 --> 01:33:50.429
[Wilkinson] There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

01:33:54.341 --> 01:33:56.809
[Abigail] Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

01:33:56.877 --> 01:34:00.938
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:07.352
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:10.549
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

01:34:12.726 --> 01:34:14.193
One step at a time. Good.

01:34:18.565 --> 01:34:21.693
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

01:34:23.604 --> 01:34:25.196
[Shouting]

01:34:25.272 --> 01:34:27.502
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

01:34:27.574 --> 01:34:29.633
I can get up there just as easy as you.

01:34:31.879 --> 01:34:32.868
Just stop.

01:34:34.348 --> 01:34:36.509
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:40.246
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

01:34:41.622 --> 01:34:42.611
Look!

01:34:45.492 --> 01:34:47.084
What's it gonna be?

01:34:56.537 --> 01:34:58.300
We'll do this your way.

01:34:58.372 --> 01:35:00.897
[Creaking, rumbling]

01:35:12.352 --> 01:35:16.220
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:17.780
One step at a time.

01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:21.651
One, two, three.

01:35:40.981 --> 01:35:42.608
- You ready?
- Go.

01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:47.015
[Grunting]

01:35:54.228 --> 01:35:55.217
Ah!

01:36:16.483 --> 01:36:18.474
[Ben] Mitch, what do you see?

01:36:19.786 --> 01:36:21.344
Is there a way out?

01:36:22.956 --> 01:36:24.480
What's up there, Mitch?

01:36:30.364 --> 01:36:34.528
[Both grunting]

01:36:36.336 --> 01:36:37.496
Em?

01:36:37.571 --> 01:36:43.009
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

01:36:47.648 --> 01:36:48.740
All right.

01:36:50.551 --> 01:36:51.677
Let's go.

01:36:52.686 --> 01:36:55.154
Mitch! Come on!

01:36:55.923 --> 01:36:58.619
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

01:36:59.059 --> 01:37:01.493
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

01:37:01.562 --> 01:37:03.689
[Riley] Promise you'll
come back for me.

01:37:03.764 --> 01:37:05.493
I can do the math too.

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:09.562
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:15.765
"No, we'll figure something else out."
"We need you there. Please, Riley."

01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:17.440
[Laughs]

01:37:17.511 --> 01:37:18.671
I'm just kidding. Go.

01:37:19.179 --> 01:37:20.737
OK...

01:37:26.053 --> 01:37:29.511
[rumbling, creaking]

01:37:49.676 --> 01:37:54.340
- One... two... three!
- Go!

01:37:59.486 --> 01:38:00.851
Oh!

01:38:01.488 --> 01:38:03.581
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:38:03.657 --> 01:38:05.215
Uh!

01:38:09.162 --> 01:38:10.186
I can't get it.

01:38:17.237 --> 01:38:19.228
Just go! Go now! Go!

01:38:21.742 --> 01:38:23.607
- All right, ready?
- Now!

01:38:23.677 --> 01:38:25.872
Ah!

01:38:25.946 --> 01:38:27.709
Riley! Hang on!

01:38:30.717 --> 01:38:35.245
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

01:38:35.322 --> 01:38:38.018
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

01:38:38.091 --> 01:38:39.456
Then roll it!

01:38:42.763 --> 01:38:43.752
[Abigail] Here it comes!

01:38:52.606 --> 01:38:54.005
[Riley] Come on, Ben!

01:38:56.877 --> 01:38:58.606
Here! Give me your hand!

01:39:01.014 --> 01:39:02.504
[Abigail] Ben!

01:39:03.717 --> 01:39:04.775
Thanks, Riley.

01:39:08.055 --> 01:39:09.920
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

01:39:13.927 --> 01:39:17.727
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

01:39:20.033 --> 01:39:22.228
So... forward.

01:39:25.772 --> 01:39:28.935
- What is this?
- [Running water]

01:39:29.009 --> 01:39:31.807
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:34.608
Oh!

01:39:39.353 --> 01:39:41.184
Put your light over there.

01:39:44.157 --> 01:39:45.624
What are you doing?

01:39:59.139 --> 01:40:01.308
[Grunts]

01:40:01.308 --> 01:40:01.569
[Grunts]

01:40:11.685 --> 01:40:14.153
[Riley] I can't see anything!
Is this it?

01:40:19.659 --> 01:40:20.648
It's oil!

01:40:59.766 --> 01:41:03.167
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

01:41:03.837 --> 01:41:05.304
We have to turn back!

01:41:14.915 --> 01:41:16.246
OK.

01:41:18.852 --> 01:41:21.844
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

01:41:24.724 --> 01:41:25.713
OK.

01:41:30.864 --> 01:41:32.092
I got it!

01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:36.861
I got you! I got you!

01:41:36.937 --> 01:41:38.302
[Both shouting]

01:41:40.574 --> 01:41:43.702
[Gasping]

01:41:43.777 --> 01:41:46.109
[Laughing]

01:42:05.765 --> 01:42:07.323
[Abigail] There's no forward!

01:42:10.337 --> 01:42:12.532
It's not forward, it's down!

01:42:13.507 --> 01:42:18.035
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:30.412
Help me turn this wheel!

01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:05.555
[Wilkinson] The water's going down.

01:43:55.675 --> 01:43:57.370
It is... Em.

01:43:58.478 --> 01:44:00.469
Em. Em.

01:44:06.686 --> 01:44:08.517
Ben! Hey!

01:44:08.588 --> 01:44:12.888
Dad! We found it!

01:44:13.259 --> 01:44:16.820
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

01:44:22.202 --> 01:44:25.467
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

01:44:25.538 --> 01:44:28.098
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

01:44:28.174 --> 01:44:32.941
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

01:44:33.013 --> 01:44:36.949
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

01:44:58.972 --> 01:45:01.532
[Gurgling, bubbling]

01:45:07.747 --> 01:45:11.080
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

01:45:11.151 --> 01:45:13.517
She was frantic. She was frantic.

01:45:14.521 --> 01:45:17.922
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see?

01:45:17.991 --> 01:45:21.927
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

01:45:21.995 --> 01:45:25.988
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

01:45:26.499 --> 01:45:28.023
Where's your mother going?

01:45:29.436 --> 01:45:30.698
[Emily gasps]

01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:33.967
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.132
- What?
- Look.

01:45:35.208 --> 01:45:37.608
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

01:45:37.677 --> 01:45:41.306
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

01:45:41.381 --> 01:45:43.212
Oh! [laughs]

01:45:43.283 --> 01:45:45.046
[Patrick] Em?

01:45:45.118 --> 01:45:47.712
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:48.688 --> 01:45:51.680
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:52.225 --> 01:45:55.058
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

01:46:02.836 --> 01:46:04.394
[Laughs]

01:46:07.974 --> 01:46:09.532
[Banging]

01:46:12.479 --> 01:46:15.471
- What was that?
- Listen.

01:46:15.548 --> 01:46:17.311
[Banging]

01:46:35.502 --> 01:46:37.265
Ah!

01:46:41.608 --> 01:46:45.271
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

01:46:45.345 --> 01:46:48.803
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

01:46:56.322 --> 01:46:58.222
Ben, there's a current!

01:46:58.658 --> 01:47:01.718
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

01:47:01.795 --> 01:47:03.888
It's under us. Right here!

01:47:13.139 --> 01:47:14.128
Come on!

01:47:15.575 --> 01:47:17.566
Let's go! Get in there!

01:47:24.617 --> 01:47:26.710
The water's rising too fast!

01:47:26.786 --> 01:47:29.516
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

01:47:46.239 --> 01:47:49.402
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

01:47:49.976 --> 01:47:52.240
It fills with water
when you open the door!

01:47:52.345 --> 01:47:55.473
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

01:47:55.515 --> 01:47:58.541
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

01:47:58.618 --> 01:48:01.314
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

01:48:01.387 --> 01:48:03.116
Patrick, Emily, go!

01:48:08.494 --> 01:48:09.552
- No.
- No!

01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:12.119
No!

01:48:12.198 --> 01:48:14.962
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

01:48:15.501 --> 01:48:17.298
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

01:48:18.771 --> 01:48:21.365
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

01:48:21.441 --> 01:48:23.671
We both know what has to happen here.

01:48:24.177 --> 01:48:27.578
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

01:48:29.549 --> 01:48:30.641
I vote Mitch.

01:48:31.718 --> 01:48:33.652
This isn't a democracy.

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:36.211
[Grunting, shouting]

01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:42.250
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

01:48:43.196 --> 01:48:45.687
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

01:48:45.765 --> 01:48:48.495
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

01:48:48.568 --> 01:48:52.834
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

01:48:52.939 --> 01:48:55.339
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

01:48:55.375 --> 01:48:59.277
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:04.672
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

01:49:08.721 --> 01:49:11.349
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

01:49:13.326 --> 01:49:14.315
[Ben] Abigail.

01:49:18.431 --> 01:49:22.162
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

01:49:31.511 --> 01:49:32.773
- No!
- Let's go!

01:49:33.279 --> 01:49:37.238
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

01:49:37.984 --> 01:49:39.611
Please, come on.

01:49:41.587 --> 01:49:42.781
Push, Ben!

01:49:46.459 --> 01:49:48.393
The current's too strong!

01:49:51.631 --> 01:49:53.826
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

01:50:09.816 --> 01:50:10.805
Ah!

01:50:16.889 --> 01:50:18.049
Mom!

01:50:18.624 --> 01:50:20.854
- [Straining]
- Hang on!

01:50:23.696 --> 01:50:24.958
Hold your breath!

01:50:34.741 --> 01:50:36.572
Ah!

01:50:36.642 --> 01:50:38.371
We got to get Ben out of there!

01:50:41.414 --> 01:50:45.714
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

01:50:45.785 --> 01:50:48.720
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

01:50:48.788 --> 01:50:52.918
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

01:50:53.026 --> 01:50:55.551
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

01:50:55.595 --> 01:50:56.960
I'll get you out!

01:50:57.030 --> 01:51:01.399
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

01:51:01.467 --> 01:51:03.458
And no one will ever know?

01:51:03.536 --> 01:51:07.768
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.401
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

01:51:11.477 --> 01:51:14.640
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

01:51:15.481 --> 01:51:18.939
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

01:51:20.453 --> 01:51:22.580
- [Straining]
- Mitch!

01:51:31.731 --> 01:51:32.789
Ah!

01:52:03.062 --> 01:52:04.188
Thank you.

01:52:21.714 --> 01:52:25.673
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- [Emily] Oh, hi.

01:52:31.924 --> 01:52:34.484
Sir! It's for you.

01:52:35.795 --> 01:52:36.784
Sadusky.

01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:40.528
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

01:52:40.933 --> 01:52:44.801
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

01:52:44.871 --> 01:52:48.534
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

01:52:48.608 --> 01:52:51.406
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

01:53:11.898 --> 01:53:14.492
Stop. Stop it.

01:53:15.601 --> 01:53:17.933
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

01:53:18.004 --> 01:53:21.770
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

01:53:21.841 --> 01:53:24.605
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

01:53:24.677 --> 01:53:28.238
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

01:53:28.581 --> 01:53:29.775
Yes, sir.

01:53:31.984 --> 01:53:33.747
- Gates.
- Sir.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:39.382
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

01:53:39.458 --> 01:53:42.985
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

01:53:44.530 --> 01:53:47.465
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.662
- Thank you.
- Craig.

01:53:52.004 --> 01:53:56.270
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

01:53:57.843 --> 01:53:58.832
Tomorrow?

01:54:07.053 --> 01:54:08.315
Thank you, sir.

01:54:09.288 --> 01:54:11.756
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

01:54:11.824 --> 01:54:13.917
will get credit for this discovery.

01:54:21.067 --> 01:54:23.433
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

01:54:24.337 --> 01:54:28.171
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

01:54:29.775 --> 01:54:32.767
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

01:54:34.313 --> 01:54:36.747
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

01:54:36.816 --> 01:54:39.011
I believe I can help with that, sir.

01:54:39.085 --> 01:54:42.282
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

01:54:45.958 --> 01:54:49.587
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

01:54:52.832 --> 01:54:53.958
What book?

01:54:55.534 --> 01:54:59.595
[Emily] Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

01:54:59.672 --> 01:55:01.936
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

01:55:02.008 --> 01:55:03.373
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

01:55:03.442 --> 01:55:06.502
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

01:55:06.579 --> 01:55:09.878
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

01:55:13.853 --> 01:55:15.286
Excuse me.

01:55:15.354 --> 01:55:19.256
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

01:55:19.325 --> 01:55:23.159
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:27.666
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

01:55:28.334 --> 01:55:30.325
- Will you sign it?
- [Crashing]

01:55:30.403 --> 01:55:31.392
OK.

01:55:40.646 --> 01:55:41.635
Thank you.

01:55:42.982 --> 01:55:46.213
So, um, the tea tables...

01:55:47.219 --> 01:55:50.950
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

01:55:51.924 --> 01:55:53.858
I was going to say
you can keep them.

01:55:54.727 --> 01:55:58.857
And maybe you could...

01:55:58.931 --> 01:56:01.229
...come and move back in with me.

01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:05.199
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?

01:56:05.271 --> 01:56:07.705
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

01:56:07.773 --> 01:56:11.732
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

01:56:11.811 --> 01:56:14.143
It's sort of like a puzzle.

01:56:15.681 --> 01:56:19.344
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

01:56:21.887 --> 01:56:23.081
So...

01:57:03.796 --> 01:57:05.354
[sighs]

01:57:07.433 --> 01:57:09.799
[Engine starts]

01:57:09.869 --> 01:57:11.496
I love this car.

01:57:16.742 --> 01:57:18.733
