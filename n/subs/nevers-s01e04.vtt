First time Mary sang,

00:14.500 --> 00:16.750
only the Touched that were
in the room could hear it.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.750
We'll make Mary's voice
loud enough

Come on, Penance. Jesus awaits.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.166
He already knows
what I was gonna say,

10:53.250 --> 10:55.291
and I'll add a few
Hail Marys for that later.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.041

are all blamin' her,

walking on water

11:18.000 --> 11:19.166

11:19.250 --> 11:20.333
He's called Odium.

somewhere in the narrows.

could be unrelated,
you and Mary.

We'll take her mind off it.

11:53.083 --> 11:56.000
It's all hands on deck,
and she has the best hands
in the group.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.792
In the meantime...

11:58.959 --> 12:00.500

You're a bitter poor
example to the girls.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.333
(imitating Amalia):
But I'm so tough and mean,
and I hate sentiment.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.041
And also people. And myself.

12:13.125 --> 12:15.250
(imitating Penance):
Ah, Lord, Mary Brighton
trusted you,

-(normal voice):
Is that what you think?

12:19.333 --> 12:21.417
(normal voice):
I think the longer
we wait to find the killer,

12:21.500 --> 12:23.250
the greater the chance
we never do.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.583
Mary doesn't need me
crying over her corpse.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.667
True, I can't imagine how many
funerals you've been to, but--

12:28.750 --> 12:31.083
None. We don't do that
when I'm from.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.250
We don't have enough time and
we don't have enough ground.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.333
You know better than
anyone what pain does

12:35.417 --> 12:36.625
when you don't
make time for it.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.959
All time does is run out.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.291
I was left here,
completely alone,

12:41.375 --> 12:43.625
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.083
No orders, no objectives--

12:45.166 --> 12:47.750
They left me here
and they fucked right off.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.125
Maybe they died.
Who cares? I'm here...

12:50.208 --> 12:53.083
where a woman can be killed
just for having a voice,

12:53.166 --> 12:54.750
which will be
the world's fucking epitaph

12:54.834 --> 12:57.375
if I can't do something
other than make it worse.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.083
I know your burdens, True.
But is vengeance

12:59.166 --> 13:00.417
going to make the world better?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.667
If we-- if we find out
who took away our Mary,

13:02.750 --> 13:04.583
I have a worry as to
your next course of action,

13:04.667 --> 13:07.125
because the rest of us,
we had a chance to say goodbye--

13:07.208 --> 13:08.709
to remember the goodness
of her heart,

13:08.792 --> 13:10.959
and not just the unfairness
of her being taken.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.458
You keep saying taken
instead of murdered.
Mary was murdered.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.000
-I was there, True.
-So was the man with the gun.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.667
He was set up
before we got there.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.291
So stop worrying about
who wasn't at the funeral,

13:22.375 --> 13:24.834
and start asking who
wasn't at that park.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.667
You don't mean one of us.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.834
Amalia:
Well, I know it wasn't me.

13:33.250 --> 13:38.375
♪

13:47.250 --> 13:49.750
(distant sobbing)

13:50.250 --> 13:51.875
(thuds)

14:04.041 --> 14:05.583
Primrose:
Myrtle?

14:05.667 --> 14:07.625
Do you want to talk?

14:07.709 --> 14:08.709
(sniffles)

14:08.792 --> 14:10.333
(speaks foreign languages)

14:10.417 --> 14:12.250
(clattering)

14:12.333 --> 14:14.583
(sobs softly)

14:14.667 --> 14:16.250
May I see?

14:32.333 --> 14:34.625
Oh, Myrtle.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.458
-This is so--
-(paper rustling)

14:41.166 --> 14:44.667
You... heard her?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.375
You wish you could hear her.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.625
(speaks foreign languages)

14:54.125 --> 14:56.667
-(speaks foreign languages)
-You want to learn to read?

14:56.750 --> 14:58.917
-(speaks foreign languages)
-Mary sang to you.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.500
To... I'm trying.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.959
Mary sang to you.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.000
(sighs)

15:09.500 --> 15:11.417
To this person.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.750
About this person?
(sighs)

15:14.834 --> 15:17.166
When Mary sang, you heard...

15:18.542 --> 15:19.959
Words.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.875
Language.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.709
Mary was telling us something,
and you understood it.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.709
Was it something nice?

15:41.083 --> 15:43.750
(bird cawing)

15:45.291 --> 15:47.625
(typewriter keys clacking)

15:47.709 --> 15:50.208
(indistinct chatter)

15:57.041 --> 15:59.125
So now you're after
our jobs as well?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.834
What angle are you pursuing?

16:00.917 --> 16:02.000
Hemlines of the deceased?

16:02.083 --> 16:04.375
I have every right to be here.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.834
(chuckles)

16:05.917 --> 16:07.375
No, you fuckin' don't.

16:07.458 --> 16:10.250
Lovely. Now I've had gin
for breakfast, too.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.125
Inky fingers don't make you
a reporter, Boyle.

16:13.208 --> 16:14.458
Inspector Mundi.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.583
Why are those Purists
being detained?

16:16.667 --> 16:19.166
Is there a connection between
them and Miss Brighton's death?

16:19.250 --> 16:21.750
Or was it your detail's
failure to catch Maladie?

16:21.834 --> 16:23.667
Is Mary another
of her messages?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.333
That story's been told.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.917
I don't believe it has.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I think there is something
much larger at work
than one maniac.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.583
Have you got information
I can use, Miss...?

16:33.667 --> 16:36.166
Boyle. Effie Boyle
from "The Sentinel,"

16:36.250 --> 16:38.083
and, well, nothing yet.

16:38.166 --> 16:41.542
But I do know the Touched
are being vilified in the press,

16:41.625 --> 16:42.750
often for no reason.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.667
It was a Touched that
killed Mary Brighton.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.959
You learn more than that,
come calling.

16:50.417 --> 16:51.917
(scoffs)

16:52.000 --> 16:54.834
Birch:
So you just happened by
Mary Brighton's funeral.

16:54.917 --> 16:57.166
Nobody told you
about the service.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.500
-We were out walking.
-(Birch scoffs)

16:59.583 --> 17:02.750
You live in the south end,
work at Marster's Mill.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.625
That's four miles
out of your way.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.208
We's peripatetic.

17:06.291 --> 17:09.709
-Look, I told you--
-Tell me.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.667
-We were walking.
-And you stopped
to yell obscenities

17:12.750 --> 17:14.041
at a grieving family.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.542
You're already going to jail.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.959
(scoffs) You can't put us in
for expressing ourselves.

17:18.041 --> 17:21.625
No. No, I'm putting you in
for assaulting a police officer.

17:24.083 --> 17:27.125
-(chuckles)
-Well, I like that plan.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.417
Enter the Ape...

17:34.333 --> 17:38.208
The Ape?
Wait. The boxer?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.667
The East End Ape?

17:40.750 --> 17:42.208
Is that-- Is that Frank Mundi?

17:42.291 --> 17:46.125
-Inspector Mundi.
-Whew. No. You're all right.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.250
Purist 2:
Look, a couple of guys
in suits approached us

17:48.333 --> 17:49.417
at a Purist meeting, all right?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.917
I don't know the guy
who said go, but...

17:52.000 --> 17:53.667
he gave us this.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.917
Said they were burying
a Touched with decent folk,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.625
and we should call 'em out.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.667
(distant indistinct chatter)

18:22.667 --> 18:25.083
Harriet:
Great, that's 6:00 in the
main dormitory downstairs.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.750
Thank you.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.625
That's another two,
so we can--

18:28.709 --> 18:31.709
Hi. Sorry, are you new
to The Orphanage?

18:31.792 --> 18:35.333
-Okay, do you speak any
languages or dialects?
-Mm-hmm.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.542
Yeah? What are they?

18:42.041 --> 18:45.458
Cops, the church, the Purists...

18:45.542 --> 18:47.291
and our masked freaks.

18:47.375 --> 18:50.000
There's no shortage
of people who hate us.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.917
But only a few are powerful
or inventive enough

18:53.000 --> 18:54.875
to have gotten Kroos
out of prison undetected.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.625
Horatio:
Maladie?

18:56.709 --> 18:58.500
Amalia:
Kroos was her man.

18:58.583 --> 18:59.667
And she's still got a network.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.583
They found Horatio
easily enough.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.083
Gilbert Massen?

19:03.166 --> 19:05.166
What, Lord Massen?

19:05.250 --> 19:07.208
The Great White Hunter.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.125
Oh, he's a piece of work.

19:09.208 --> 19:12.041
I got chums in his factory
talkin' about a strike,

19:12.125 --> 19:13.750
cause he pays a pittance!

19:13.834 --> 19:15.041
And it's dangerous.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.834
It's bombs and the like
they're handlin'.

19:16.917 --> 19:19.375
But it's a fine fuck-thee-well
if you're injured.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.792
He'd stick your head
on his wall for a trophy

19:20.875 --> 19:23.125
'fore he'd give you thruppence
to feed your kids.

19:24.792 --> 19:25.834
Oh...

19:25.917 --> 19:28.041
I've gone all political. Sorry.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.291
-No, it was quite rousing.
-(door opens)

19:30.375 --> 19:32.083
Horatio, Lucy, and Penance:
No.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.083
-(door closes)
-Right. So...

19:36.166 --> 19:38.458
-The Beggar King.
-Lucy: A bit public for him.

19:38.542 --> 19:39.834
Horatio:
But he runs Odium,

19:39.917 --> 19:44.000
and since we have a hard-won
lead on his address--

19:44.083 --> 19:46.125
I'll take it. I know the area.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.834
If Mrs. True isn't
looking for a rematch.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.375
No. I'm going to talk
to Massen. Alone.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.000
Lucy:
You sure that's the way to go?

19:55.083 --> 19:57.750
-He's hardly gonna fall into--
-No, I mean, I'm going to.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.542
Sometime today.
I've already seen it.

19:59.625 --> 20:03.166
Wasn't sure where I was
at first, but... or will be.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.500
Wait, does-- does that
mean Massen killed Mary?

20:05.583 --> 20:06.625
Did the ripplings tell you that?

20:06.709 --> 20:08.625
They tell me I don't get
to plan my own day.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.041
They're not treasure maps.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.667
I'll learn something,
I'm sure, but...

20:11.750 --> 20:12.959
Penance:
And once you have?

20:13.041 --> 20:14.667
I mean, if you get something

20:14.750 --> 20:16.500
in the way of, uh, "he did it."

20:16.583 --> 20:19.208
Then I will bring that
information back here.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.250
I'm not planning to attack
a Peer of the Realm

20:21.333 --> 20:22.500
inside his well-guarded house.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.250
Hmm, sure, but what
you mean to happen

20:24.333 --> 20:26.208
and what actually happens
in the thick of it...

20:26.291 --> 20:27.834
It's not just you, True.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.667
Everyone has to keep
their heads.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.792
Mary's death needs
to be answered, and
not with another death.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.667
And it's not
just about what's right.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.166
We're hated right now.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.041
Our first response
cannot be hate.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.667
We'll be lined up
in the streets.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.333
And they may have killed Mary
exactly for that purpose.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.250
Make us do something
they can rain hell on us for.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.333
See? Annie agrees,
and she's terrible.

20:48.417 --> 20:49.583
-And so do I.
-Good.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.542
-Level heads.
-All right. Augustus Bidlow?

20:52.625 --> 20:54.208
Yeah, we should murder him.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.959
Lucy:
I'm with Penance.
That party they thrown,

20:57.041 --> 20:58.500
seeing how he treated her,

20:58.583 --> 21:00.917
I nearly pulled off me gloves.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.417
Lavinia Bidlow, as well.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.041
Or are you just writing down
people you know?

21:04.125 --> 21:06.083
Amalia told her
we were going to the park.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.667
-Amalia: And she knew
where I'd be coming from.
-Lucy: Still,

21:08.750 --> 21:11.083
she might be a bit
over-puckered, but she's
the reason we've got all this.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.333
Mm-hmm. The family that
sponsored my medical training--

21:14.417 --> 21:17.208
that brought me from
Jamaica to England...

21:17.291 --> 21:19.792
A week in their house,
and I almost swam back.

21:19.875 --> 21:23.291
I've been left for dead
by men with less contempt.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.125
Now, Miss Bidlow,
she means well,

21:25.208 --> 21:27.500
and I know she does
good work for the Touched,

21:27.583 --> 21:29.458
but it doesn't
make her a friend.

21:29.542 --> 21:32.625
So she goes on the list
with her terrible,
bird-watching brother.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.458
He's the ringleader.
You know he--

21:35.542 --> 21:38.542
likes... birds.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.125
Birds are stupid.

21:40.208 --> 21:42.542
And it's high time
you told him that.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.667
What? Go and talk--
No!

21:45.750 --> 21:47.959
-I should do Annie's.
-Track an assassin?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.750
Come on, Pen,
you can give Bidlow
the old parasol.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.959
-(knocking on door)
-Lucy, Penance, and Horatio:
No!

21:53.041 --> 21:54.458
-Oh.
-Sorry.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.875
Doctor Cousens,
we got a few peaky ones
down there.

21:56.959 --> 21:58.875
-How are you holding up?
-Oh, well,

21:58.959 --> 22:01.417
my Nigel doesn't really
understand what's going on.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.500
But I'm keeping my chins up.
(laughs)

22:03.583 --> 22:06.083
Sometimes pretending you
feel good makes you feel better.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.125
-Trust me.
-Horatio: All right.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.041
Let's see to those patients.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.291
-Don't do anything rash.
-I won't.

22:12.375 --> 22:15.417
-I was talking to Penance.
-(laughs)

22:15.500 --> 22:18.375
-(door closes)
-Annie: Shouldn't you
take Désirée with you

22:18.458 --> 22:21.166
-to Massen's?
-Amalia: I should.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.583
But I don't.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.583
-(soft music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

22:41.834 --> 22:46.417
(chuckles)
That's a pungent gambit, Tommy.

22:52.959 --> 22:54.959
-(grunting)
-Frank.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.250
Frank!

22:57.333 --> 22:58.959
(grunts)

22:59.041 --> 23:00.000
(yells)

23:00.083 --> 23:02.625
You've been mixing
with the Purists.

23:02.709 --> 23:03.834
Stirring them up.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.333
Did you want to
scare the Touched,

23:05.417 --> 23:08.125
so you could tell 'em
they was only safe with you?

23:08.208 --> 23:09.709
Uh, first of all, who--

23:09.792 --> 23:12.792
-(cracks)
-Who are the fucking Purists?

23:14.125 --> 23:15.583
(clatters)

23:21.125 --> 23:23.083
That's not mine.

23:23.166 --> 23:26.000
You really think
I'd be handing out
personalized evidence?

23:26.083 --> 23:27.417
Butler:
Master Swann.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.208
Any assistance required?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.208
Uh, no, thank you. Uh...

23:32.291 --> 23:34.208
Just a bit of sport.
We'll keep quiet.

23:34.291 --> 23:36.333
Butler:
This is a members only
establishment.

23:36.417 --> 23:38.959
And you need to fuck off.
Please.

23:39.041 --> 23:41.959
Uh, yes, uh, do fuck off.
There's a lad.

23:45.041 --> 23:49.375
-(door closes)
-Look. Think about this.

23:49.458 --> 23:52.208
If they'd said it was
Lord Such-and-What,

23:52.291 --> 23:55.750
you'd be gathering evidence.
Having him followed.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.792
Behaving like a detective.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.959
Someone pointed you
and pulled your trigger.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.792
It's no secret
that you loathe me.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.458
That don't mean you're innocent.

24:05.542 --> 24:08.166
(laughs) When--
When have I ever claimed...

24:09.667 --> 24:12.792
Wait. Are you talking
about the shooting?

24:12.875 --> 24:14.834
I'm not a murderer.

24:16.166 --> 24:19.000
-I had nothing against Mary.
-She was a rival.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.625
I think you know she wasn't.

24:20.709 --> 24:25.333
Look, I... I will provide you
with my whereabouts.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.500
I wanted to learn
about Amalia True,

24:27.583 --> 24:31.542
and what I've learned
is stay away.

24:31.625 --> 24:35.208
-I am not a part of this.
-'Course you are.

24:35.291 --> 24:38.917
And if it ain't you,
it's one of them toffs
you play chess with.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.542
Oh, uh, actually we call it
cheese because we--

24:41.625 --> 24:44.291
It's rich men grinding up
them who's helpless

24:44.375 --> 24:46.166
for extra penny on the pound,

24:46.250 --> 24:49.792
or, or the rights to
a patch of sand. Or a fuck.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.500
-Are we done?
-Oh, we're done, Swann.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.166
Across the board.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.250
And our little arrangement,

24:57.333 --> 24:59.125
my debt, is done.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.834
Cause I got something
over you now.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.583
I don't fucking care.

25:11.417 --> 25:13.125
-Harriet: Translators.
-Aneel (on phone): Bring Klaus?

25:13.208 --> 25:16.166
Yes, bring Klaus.
Anyone who speaks
another language,

25:16.250 --> 25:18.166
or who studied
a dead language really well.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.417
I've only got law Latin.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.667
-(indistinct chatter over phone)
-Oh, it's trouble.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.417
Well, you can sneak out
for a kiss anytime,
but not when I need your help?

25:24.500 --> 25:26.917
-Aneel, you know
I wouldn't ask--
-No, of course, I'll do it.

25:27.041 --> 25:30.125
Thank you. I love you.
Yeah. Six o'clock.

25:30.208 --> 25:32.667
(cawing)

25:47.208 --> 25:49.291
-Mr. Bidlow.
-Oh.

25:50.375 --> 25:51.834
Miss Adair.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.709
Uh, what are you...

25:54.792 --> 25:57.000
Uh, so, does Lavinia
know you're here?

25:57.083 --> 25:58.792
I know very well that
I'm not welcome here.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.166
No, you are. You are.
It's, it's--

26:01.250 --> 26:03.542
It's wonderful to--

26:03.625 --> 26:05.250
Did, did anybody see you?

26:05.333 --> 26:08.041
You seem a bit nervous.

26:08.125 --> 26:11.375
Well, I mean, I usually am,

26:11.458 --> 26:14.291
but, but you're well?
No, Lord, no.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.333
No, of course.
I'm so sorry. Um...

26:17.417 --> 26:22.458
May I offer my most sincere
condolences about Miss Brighton?

26:22.542 --> 26:25.542
She wouldn't have been
entertaining to your friends,

26:25.625 --> 26:28.291
so you needn't grieve overly.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.375
Lavinia made me do it.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.250
She, she, she said
it would be bad for you.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.208
-Bad for me?
-Yes, that's why I did it.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.458
She said if I didn't,
that there would be cons--

26:42.375 --> 26:43.542
Wait.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.583
Wait, it wa-- It was bad.

26:45.667 --> 26:48.375
-So, how is it bad?
-Are you making a joke of this?

26:48.458 --> 26:52.709
You can't, you can't p--
possibly have had any deep,

26:52.792 --> 26:54.542
emotional conn-- connection to--

26:54.625 --> 26:56.375
Oh, no, I'm saying,
I'm saying this all wrong.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.458
I'm saying it wrong.

26:58.542 --> 27:00.875
I thought it was
the gentlemanly thing to do.

27:00.959 --> 27:03.291
Murder?

27:03.375 --> 27:05.250
-I'm sorry, what?
-Oh, you are a monster.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.583
And you're gonna go to prison.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.125
-I don't care how rich you are.
-What's happening?

27:08.208 --> 27:09.709
What's happening?
I don't know what's happening.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.500
You just confessed to
the murder of Mary Brighton,

27:11.583 --> 27:14.291
and I made a wax
recording of it.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.125
(hissing)

27:17.208 --> 27:20.458
(clacking, sparking)

27:20.542 --> 27:22.208
Ugh.

27:22.291 --> 27:25.125
-Fuckin' prototype.
-Miss Adair.

27:25.208 --> 27:28.125
-You are a terrible person!
-Yes, I know. I know!

27:28.208 --> 27:30.625
But I-- I didn't kill Miss--
Can I--

27:30.709 --> 27:32.417
Uh, I'm fine.

27:34.709 --> 27:36.625
I was referring to the party.

27:37.834 --> 27:40.542
It's my... awful...

27:40.625 --> 27:42.667
I was just abominably rude.

27:42.750 --> 27:45.333
And I've barely slept since.

27:45.417 --> 27:48.333
When I heard what happened,
I wanted to reach out to you
in your grief,

27:48.417 --> 27:52.333
and it just-- it seemed--
it seemed opportunistic, or--

27:52.417 --> 27:54.750
You, you didn't kill Mary?

27:55.917 --> 27:59.291
Is-- is that bad? Um, it's...

28:00.166 --> 28:02.000
Of course you didn't.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.542
You're as gentle as a blush.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.792
But you're still terrible.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.542
Yeah.

28:09.625 --> 28:14.000
Tell me just anything that
I can do to make amends.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.208
I cried,

28:16.291 --> 28:19.250
which seems petty now
to think about, but...

28:20.583 --> 28:24.208
I don't-- I don't have
a lot of experience with men.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.250
Certainly not of your class,
which from what I've seen...

28:27.333 --> 28:31.000
No, nobody is quite
as barbaric as the well-to-do.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.083
Your Lucy had me figured out.

28:38.291 --> 28:40.083
Miss Adair,
I would give anything

28:40.166 --> 28:41.834
if you would erase
that day from your mind.

28:41.917 --> 28:44.458
That's not how it works.

28:45.208 --> 28:46.417
No.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.417
No.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.500
Nor should it be.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.250
Remember my transgressions,

28:55.333 --> 28:58.625
so that I may re-earn your trust
honestly, over time.

28:59.667 --> 29:02.333
If we are...

29:02.417 --> 29:06.208
If we are to be acquainted,

29:06.291 --> 29:07.792
I shall endeavor--

29:07.875 --> 29:11.417
No, no, no, no!
Damn acquaintance.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.417
Acquaintance is exhausting.
I just--

29:13.500 --> 29:15.875
I want to be your friend,
Miss Adair.

29:19.667 --> 29:23.792
I want--
I want to become your friend.

29:25.375 --> 29:28.917
You sent the flowers for Mary.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.625
-Was the wreath too much?
It was, it was garish.
-No.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.208
Do you think your sister
did the murder then?

29:42.709 --> 29:43.917
What?

29:48.125 --> 29:50.542
(grunting)

29:52.417 --> 29:53.792
(screaming)

29:53.875 --> 29:55.291
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

29:55.375 --> 29:56.458
(yelling)

29:56.542 --> 29:58.166
I was only askin'.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.709
Nimble:
Maybe it's your tone of voice.

30:05.375 --> 30:08.208
-How'd you get there?
-I'm Nimble.

30:09.959 --> 30:12.166
No, I'm Nimble,

30:12.250 --> 30:14.125
as in, "How do you do?
Nimble Jack.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.959
-But my friends all call me--"
-You didn't answer my question.

30:16.041 --> 30:19.500
Well, I'm wondering what
a sweet thing like you
is doing 'round here.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.583
I'm from around here.

30:21.667 --> 30:25.083
-They don't seem
to remember you.
-No, they did.

30:26.667 --> 30:29.792
-What do you want?
-A drink, maybe.

30:29.875 --> 30:33.333
Light supper?
Three Vicars does
a nice eel pie.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.709
-Private room.
-(flames roaring)

30:40.917 --> 30:42.458
Too fast?

30:42.542 --> 30:45.542
-You work for the Beggar King.
-Nimble: With.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.750
On occasion.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.875
One of his gang
plays the fiddle.

30:49.959 --> 30:52.417
Gave up an address
to a belligerent widow.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.333
Fiddler said he tried
to fight, but...

30:54.417 --> 30:57.625
she got him pinned,
and squeezed it out of him.

30:57.709 --> 31:00.834
Poor Declan. He really
can't find decent help.

31:00.917 --> 31:03.583
-Which is why he'd prefer
you don't kill Odium.
-(scoffs) Yeah.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.417
Nimble:
This wasn't the King's work.
Come on.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.542
Maladie's man shoots
the Brighton girl.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.417
Beggar King's chief enforcer
goes after the widow.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.417
Someone's puttin' on a show.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.500
I need more than "someone."

31:15.583 --> 31:17.333
Odium knows fuck all.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.000
He's dim, bless him,
and he's in for another
thrashing.

31:21.083 --> 31:24.750
But he's necessary
to keep the peace.

31:24.834 --> 31:26.917
Keep appearances.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.959
Leave Odium be,

31:29.041 --> 31:32.625
and the opium you torched
is bygones.

31:32.709 --> 31:34.125
Friends.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.709
Or... common enemy.

31:37.792 --> 31:41.083
-Thug: Where is she?
-This lot,
he doesn't care about.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.959
(thugs yelling)

31:43.041 --> 31:45.458
-Seems like they all
remember you.
-Just keep your head down.

31:45.542 --> 31:47.166
Never have, never will.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.709
(men shouting)

31:54.500 --> 31:56.792
-(shouting continues)
-(flames roaring)

31:59.709 --> 32:04.041
♪

32:27.542 --> 32:29.000
Thank you for seeing me.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.500
The Bidlows are old friends.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.917
Lavinia and I may not
see eye-to-eye on everything,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.875
but she doesn't waste her time
with trifling people.

32:35.959 --> 32:37.792
I think she regards you
quite highly.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.375
I owe her a great deal.
Everyone at The Orphanage does.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.750
Forgive me.
I did read about your girl,
Miss Brighton.

32:43.834 --> 32:46.208
I suspect you've had
all the condolences
you have room for,

32:46.291 --> 32:48.709
so may I offer you a sherry?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.166
Bit early, but...

32:52.291 --> 32:54.792
And may I also offer

32:54.875 --> 32:57.291
a conjecture?

32:57.375 --> 33:00.875
You think that I had something
to do with your friend's death.

33:00.959 --> 33:03.750
Did you? It would save me
such a lot of time.

33:03.834 --> 33:07.208
I'm going to have to
disappoint you, I'm afraid.

33:07.291 --> 33:10.125
No one at the club is vying
for credit either,

33:10.208 --> 33:11.667
though I will keep an ear out.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.125
Appreciated.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.834
But, what I could really use
is your perspective,

33:16.917 --> 33:20.083
as a military man and a powerful
member of the established order.

33:20.166 --> 33:23.208
Whoever did have
Mary Brighton killed was
making a public statement.

33:23.291 --> 33:25.792
Like stepping on stage
and murdering six people.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.875
-A different message.
-The same messenger.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.458
That gunman, Kroos.

33:29.542 --> 33:31.166
-Well, he's taken care of.
-Shame.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.500
He might have talked.

33:33.583 --> 33:36.000
You killed her.
Let's say.

33:36.083 --> 33:37.500
If you'll indulge me,

33:37.583 --> 33:39.041
I've found this
a useful exercise.

33:39.125 --> 33:42.333
Let's assume it wasn't Maladie
or an erstwhile lover,

33:42.417 --> 33:44.667
but someone with
a broader view.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.291
You'll take the part of the
mastermind behind Mary's death.

33:47.375 --> 33:49.458
And you'll be
the irate inspector?

33:49.542 --> 33:51.250
I'll be Mary.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.542
Why would you want me dead?

33:54.625 --> 33:56.458
I doubt that I do.

33:58.041 --> 34:02.542
I'm not entirely clear
what your "turn" is.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.875
A beacon of some sort?

34:04.959 --> 34:08.542
Anyway benign,
and you're an
inoffensive woman.

34:08.625 --> 34:10.959
No history of radicalism,
I assume.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.375
So why me?

34:12.458 --> 34:14.291
Why not kill that widow,
Mrs. True?

34:14.375 --> 34:15.875
She's a willful creature,

34:15.959 --> 34:17.583
and the leader
of this motley coven.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.333
Which means
she must have enemies.

34:19.417 --> 34:22.792
Her death might be tragic,
but perhaps not unexpected.

34:22.875 --> 34:25.500
You, on the other hand,
are a pure

34:25.583 --> 34:26.959
and blameless woman.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.291
And all in white, no less.

34:29.375 --> 34:32.250
A statuesque beauty
with a mass of auburn hair

34:32.333 --> 34:34.583
and great shining eyes...

34:34.667 --> 34:36.250
Christ, I'm not just a beacon.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.709
I genuinely resemble
a lighthouse.

34:41.709 --> 34:44.166
It isn't just a warning.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.917
It's about hope.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.709
It's about pulling
the heart out of the orphans.

34:50.083 --> 34:52.250
I would think so.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.417
In fact, I would say,

34:54.500 --> 34:56.166
Miss Brighton,

34:56.250 --> 34:59.166
that you are a casualty of war.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.625
So we're at war.

35:04.542 --> 35:05.917
A few years back,

35:06.000 --> 35:07.834
a pestilence ran
through this city.

35:07.917 --> 35:10.875
Some anarchic cabal

35:11.000 --> 35:14.625
found or developed
a power that mocks God.

35:14.709 --> 35:18.083
That molests and disfigures
His natural law.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.667
(inhales)

35:19.750 --> 35:22.625
It was an attack on
the stability, the harmony,

35:22.709 --> 35:25.375
if you will, of the empire.

35:25.458 --> 35:28.792
And we must show the victims
of this deliberate plague

35:28.875 --> 35:31.125
that they are not special.
They are not a community.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.875
Victims is all they have
license to be.

35:34.959 --> 35:38.625
If I am your killer revealed,

35:38.709 --> 35:41.333
behold the lion,

35:41.417 --> 35:43.083
Great Britain.

35:43.166 --> 35:44.875
An empire unparalleled

35:44.959 --> 35:48.041
and unmerciful in
its self-preservation.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.208
My enemy is England.

35:53.291 --> 35:56.041
-Well, that narrows it down.
Thank God I came.
-I said your killer.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.458
Your enemy, Miss Brighton,

35:58.542 --> 36:01.667
is the scum
who caused this plague,

36:01.750 --> 36:03.542
the fools who call it power,

36:03.625 --> 36:05.750
and the woman
who should have known

36:05.834 --> 36:09.083
what would happen
to you in that park.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.375
Unless, of course,

36:12.458 --> 36:14.417
she did.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.792
So, he confessed
without confessing.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.333
It was honestly impressive.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.667
I should have worn
your recording frame.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.458
But he didn't give up
his source.

36:24.542 --> 36:26.166
He never flat-out said.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.333
Even if we had proof,
Massen knows we couldn't
touch him.

36:28.417 --> 36:31.458
-I could touch him.
-Oh, please tell me we're not
havin' this talk again.

36:31.542 --> 36:34.208
No. Even if he gave the order,

36:34.291 --> 36:36.125
he's part of something
much bigger.

36:36.208 --> 36:39.875
Pull out one piece,
it would be replaced in a day.

36:39.959 --> 36:41.834
And damn it, it's wrong.

36:41.917 --> 36:44.875
He's a human being
who's alive, damn it.

36:44.959 --> 36:46.834
We still need a response.

36:46.917 --> 36:49.458
If we let murder slide,
it will only slide down.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.875
Whatever's next will be worse.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.625
Even I know that's true.

36:54.709 --> 36:57.041
Well, some of the lads say
he has a warehouse

36:57.125 --> 36:58.667
full of munitions
we could torch.

36:58.750 --> 37:02.875
-Hmm.
-I don't think there's
anyone in there at night.

37:02.959 --> 37:07.500
Amalia:
He deserves much worse,
but it would be a start.

37:08.959 --> 37:10.500
All in favor?

37:10.583 --> 37:12.208
Birch:
You fuckin' idiot.

37:12.291 --> 37:14.208
You might as well
have marched in
the House of Lords

37:14.291 --> 37:15.333
and had a slash!

37:15.417 --> 37:17.208
Superintendent's had an earful.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.542
I was pursuing a lead.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.333
Unless Maladie was havin'
tea in that club,

37:20.417 --> 37:21.750
Superintendent
don't want to hear it.

37:21.834 --> 37:24.750
-Superintendent:
Mundi! Get in here!
-(phone ringing)

37:24.834 --> 37:26.667
It'll be fine.

37:28.041 --> 37:31.166
-Can I have your desk?
-You can cop a mouse.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.875
(breathing heavily)

37:38.208 --> 37:40.458
Maladie:
Shh... shh...

37:40.542 --> 37:43.750
-Let him go.
-But he lies about me.

37:43.834 --> 37:45.083
He'll stop.

37:45.166 --> 37:47.583
And, and he'll resign,
and, and he'll never

37:47.667 --> 37:50.875
-bother you again--
-Oh, now you're lying!
I heard you wouldn't.

37:50.959 --> 37:53.125
And, whoa, the papers!

37:53.208 --> 37:56.166
They say I killed Mary.
They call me crazy.

37:56.250 --> 37:58.125
I never did it.

37:58.208 --> 38:00.834
I only kill angels.
Mostly.

38:00.917 --> 38:03.709
I liked Mary so much.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.542
She was gonna be my pet,
and sleep on my belly.

38:06.625 --> 38:09.375
-You were gonna hang her.
-Well, we had a lot of plans.

38:09.458 --> 38:11.291
(grunts)

38:11.375 --> 38:14.333
She talked about the detective
who was smart, and honest.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.208
And she didn't marry him
because he was sad.

38:17.291 --> 38:19.000
For Mary's sake, will you--

38:19.083 --> 38:21.792
-Will you let him live?
-Oh, she doesn't have
a sake, love.

38:21.875 --> 38:25.000
She's dead.
She's all cold in that box.

38:25.083 --> 38:28.083
Everyone crying as they
lowered it in the hole,

38:28.166 --> 38:30.625
singin' about the workday,
and what.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.125
Y-- You were there?

38:33.208 --> 38:36.583
Of course.
(panting)

38:36.667 --> 38:39.333
I was in the box.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.291
I had a little cuddle.

38:41.375 --> 38:42.959
But she smelled different.

38:43.041 --> 38:47.000
And I will not believe
that was her favorite dress.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.500
What do you want?

38:48.583 --> 38:50.917
I want everyone to stop lying.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.834
Can you see to that?

38:52.917 --> 38:55.166
I will try.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.625
I have to think about
my reputation. (pants)

39:00.125 --> 39:03.750
Things never come back
when they go away.

39:03.834 --> 39:06.417
-Ha!
-Frank: In here! Now!

39:08.625 --> 39:10.000
Oh, Christ.

39:10.083 --> 39:11.375
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

39:11.458 --> 39:13.000
Oh, no!

39:13.083 --> 39:15.000
That's a form of lying!

39:15.083 --> 39:16.917
(Maladie screams)

39:17.750 --> 39:19.667
(screams, giggles)

39:19.750 --> 39:21.333
No!

39:22.500 --> 39:24.709
-(Maladie yells)
-(Frank grunts)

39:24.792 --> 39:27.291
(grunting, yelling)

39:28.834 --> 39:31.375
-(smashing)
-(grunting, yelling)

39:31.458 --> 39:32.834
(groaning)

39:37.542 --> 39:39.625
(panting)

39:49.291 --> 39:51.875
(panting)

39:51.959 --> 39:53.959
(running footsteps approaching)

39:55.875 --> 39:57.291
Mundi.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.709
Fuck, it's her! It's Maladie!

40:00.792 --> 40:02.166
He fucking got her!

40:03.667 --> 40:05.583
Officer:
Right. Not so scary now--

40:05.667 --> 40:07.291
-(yelling)
-Frank: All right.

40:07.375 --> 40:09.333
-(knife clatters)
-Hey.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.667
Justice.

40:11.750 --> 40:15.000
She gets justice from us.

40:15.083 --> 40:18.208
I'll have badge and balls
off any man who tries that.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.000
She gets justice from us.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.333
Okay, everybody.

40:27.417 --> 40:28.917
Ready?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.375
Translator:
Okay.

40:30.458 --> 40:33.083
Harriet:
Right. Myrtle?

40:33.166 --> 40:35.542
-Nice and loud.
-(speaks foreign languages)

40:37.792 --> 40:39.208
Myrtle.

40:39.875 --> 40:41.750
A little slower.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.625
Uh...

40:43.709 --> 40:46.709
(speaks foreign languages)

41:02.208 --> 41:05.083
(translators murmuring)

41:06.375 --> 41:07.750
Again?

41:08.500 --> 41:09.834
Um, uh...

41:09.917 --> 41:12.709
(speaks foreign languages)

41:17.208 --> 41:19.959
Cook:
(speaks foreign language)
I know it!

41:20.041 --> 41:22.625
(speaks foreign language)
The darkness.

41:22.709 --> 41:25.375
Dark. Um, uh, before the dark?

41:25.458 --> 41:27.709
Uh, come before the dark.

41:27.792 --> 41:29.333
Sí, sí.

41:29.417 --> 41:30.667
Was that near the end?

41:30.750 --> 41:33.667
-(chuckles softly)
-Again.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.208
(speaks foreign languages)

41:44.333 --> 41:46.625
(vibrates, shatters)

41:56.500 --> 41:58.709
(indistinct chatter)

42:01.000 --> 42:03.333
My mate said the warehouse--
Yeah.

42:03.417 --> 42:04.792
It's that one.

42:04.875 --> 42:07.792
And the entrance
is on the far side.

42:07.875 --> 42:09.875
And that lot?

42:09.959 --> 42:11.542
I promised Penance.

42:11.625 --> 42:14.208
-Because it's your turn again!
-No, it ain't my turn
to get the cup.

42:14.291 --> 42:16.375
-I always got to get the cup.
-Just do what you're told,
all right?

42:16.458 --> 42:18.458
-If the foreman finds out
we've left...
-(music box tune playing)

42:18.542 --> 42:20.375
-Do you hear that?
-(clattering)

42:20.458 --> 42:23.000
(music box tune continues)

42:23.083 --> 42:25.625
Bloody hell.
What the blazes is that?

42:26.291 --> 42:27.875
(steam hissing)

42:27.959 --> 42:30.125
(all coughing)

42:32.375 --> 42:35.458
-(thudding)
-(groaning)

42:35.542 --> 42:38.375
Annie:
Do you ever think maybe
Penance is frightening?

42:38.458 --> 42:42.583
And what were you gonna do?
Hand 'em a daisy?

42:42.667 --> 42:45.542
-Stay outside.
-I'm the one with the fire.

42:45.625 --> 42:48.542
And we need to make sure
no one goes up in it.

42:48.625 --> 42:50.458
Your funeral.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.834
♪

43:17.166 --> 43:20.834
♪

43:26.375 --> 43:29.917
-No one.
-Looks good.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.625
Due to ship out at dawn.

43:32.709 --> 43:34.917
I'd like to see his face.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.125
Let's open a couple.
Make sure we have
the right shipment.

43:37.208 --> 43:39.667
You sure the guards
are still sleepin'?

43:39.750 --> 43:41.083
We have time.

43:41.166 --> 43:45.166
Yeah. No, I just have
that-- that feeling.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.500
Lucy.

43:49.959 --> 43:51.250
Open the crate.

43:57.208 --> 44:00.166
Well, now we know why
the war isn't going better.

44:01.583 --> 44:04.875
They swore
they were weapons, True.

44:04.959 --> 44:07.542
They must be workin' for...

44:08.750 --> 44:10.375
(sighs)

44:17.000 --> 44:19.709
-How'd you cop it?
-It was the rippling.

44:19.792 --> 44:22.542
Your talk of Massen's hunting.
His trophies.

44:22.625 --> 44:25.333
You'd have to have been
in his study to call that up.

44:25.417 --> 44:27.458
I might have missed it
if I hadn't seen it twice.

44:27.542 --> 44:31.500
-My clapper of a mouth.
-And then this perfectly
convenient plan.

44:31.583 --> 44:34.709
Warehouse of munitions
no one's really guarding?

44:34.792 --> 44:36.542
Christ,
it was all already there.

44:36.625 --> 44:39.125
The questions, the absences,

44:39.208 --> 44:41.542
the money you swore
you didn't steal so
we'd assume you did.

44:41.625 --> 44:43.417
-I figured that'd
get a bit tired.
-You clean my study,

44:43.500 --> 44:45.834
but you can't make
your own bed.
I am such an idiot.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.750
I didn't know what they
was plannin' for Mary.

44:48.834 --> 44:51.166
-I swear.
-What else would
they have ever done,

44:51.250 --> 44:52.959
after you told them
Mary was a beacon?

44:53.041 --> 44:57.125
-What do you want, True?
-I want it to be someone else!

44:57.208 --> 44:59.917
I want it to be Harriet,
or Jo.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.917
Or the one who does,
she... Helen.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.792
-Maud.
-The one who does
the cartwheels. Fuck!

45:05.875 --> 45:08.542
You were the first woman,
the first woman

45:08.625 --> 45:10.875
to walk through those doors!

45:10.959 --> 45:13.500
The one I could lean on
instead of protecting,

45:13.583 --> 45:14.917
that understood the world

45:15.000 --> 45:18.500
-the way that I do.
-You don't know fuck
about the world.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.792
All your war stories.

45:20.875 --> 45:25.792
You don't know which war.
Oh, oh, it's awful.

45:25.875 --> 45:28.417
'Cause you've left bodies
on the field,

45:28.500 --> 45:30.458
and you're all damaged.

45:30.542 --> 45:34.625
I broke my son to pieces.

45:35.625 --> 45:40.000
I held my baby,
and it killed him.

45:40.083 --> 45:43.166
And it wasn't sudden
like I said.

45:43.250 --> 45:47.250
The breaks, they were sudden.

45:47.333 --> 45:51.333
But he... he held on.

45:51.417 --> 45:53.375
And he screamed.

45:55.083 --> 45:58.917
He screamed longer than I did
pushin' him out...

45:59.000 --> 46:00.959
'fore his heart gave.

46:02.166 --> 46:06.542
So you tell me, are we sisters?

46:06.625 --> 46:10.667
It's been three years since
I've touched another person.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.834
And Massen,
he says he'll find a cure.

46:13.917 --> 46:15.417
Of course he tells you that.

46:15.500 --> 46:18.709
And what are you telling us?

46:18.792 --> 46:21.291
A better world?

46:21.375 --> 46:24.625
How many of your precious
orphans would be lining up

46:24.709 --> 46:26.500
to be free of your better world

46:26.583 --> 46:28.250
if they had half a chance?

46:28.333 --> 46:30.667
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

46:30.750 --> 46:32.083
I don't know what happened.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.709
How do you know
how it's supposed to be?

46:36.500 --> 46:38.500
Did you do this?

46:39.750 --> 46:42.709
Did you make this nightmare?

46:42.792 --> 46:45.041
I just got left behind.

46:47.291 --> 46:50.291
'Course you got left behind.
What good are you?

46:50.375 --> 46:52.125
You, a leader?

46:52.208 --> 46:54.083
You're out whoring
when your girls need--

46:54.166 --> 46:58.375
Your boss told me today
that we're at war.

46:58.458 --> 46:59.792
I didn't start it.

46:59.875 --> 47:02.667
I didn't even volunteer.
But he's right.

47:02.750 --> 47:06.000
I hope he told you what happens
to spies during wartime.

47:06.083 --> 47:08.041
Is that what this is?

47:09.291 --> 47:12.792
There's rules of engagement.

47:12.875 --> 47:16.375
And not just you
needing to take your
failure out on someone.

47:17.250 --> 47:19.417
(gun cocks)

47:19.500 --> 47:22.417
You think Penance will
forgive you for this?

47:23.583 --> 47:25.041
You think Mary would?

47:25.125 --> 47:26.417
-And that's where you lose me.
-(grunts)

47:26.500 --> 47:28.709
-(fires)
-(shattering)

47:37.250 --> 47:39.750
-(rumbling)
-(shattering)

47:39.834 --> 47:41.166
(yells)

47:43.208 --> 47:45.458
(grunting, yelling)

47:46.500 --> 47:47.917
(yells)

47:50.959 --> 47:52.792
(grunting)

47:56.250 --> 47:58.375
(punching)

47:58.458 --> 48:01.333
(rumbling, cracking)

48:04.792 --> 48:07.458
(both groaning)

48:09.959 --> 48:12.333
(panting)

48:26.750 --> 48:28.166
(gun cocks)

48:35.125 --> 48:36.500
(groans)

48:51.000 --> 48:54.917
You're finished in London.
Forever.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.709
Annie and I will put you
on a boat and you'll stay on it

48:57.792 --> 48:59.458
until you're well
and fucking gone.

48:59.542 --> 49:01.542
And you'll tell me
everything you know.

49:01.625 --> 49:04.000
Everything. Yes?

49:07.875 --> 49:09.917
Where are the real munitions?

49:11.417 --> 49:14.083
(explosions)

49:15.792 --> 49:18.500
Massen:
A fire? Oh, no!

49:18.583 --> 49:19.917
-Foreman (over phone):
It's everywhere.
-How?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.959
My men were just
doing the rounds.

49:22.041 --> 49:24.083
Everything exploded,
and it was, it was chaos!

49:24.166 --> 49:27.083

about emotion than...

Or emotion plus semantics,

52:33.083 --> 52:35.792
but she remembered a lot.
She just didn't know
how to tell us.

Myrtle.

52:39.875 --> 52:43.458
-What did she say?
-Uh, she said,
"You're not alone."

embodies Massen's spirit.

extraordinary gates

59:15.083 --> 59:20.000
to any of the interiors

gentlemen,

you would find a lot of them
would have hunting trophies,

59:23.417 --> 59:24.709
and things on the wall.

59:25.166 --> 59:27.417
To do the interior
of Massen's estate,

59:27.500 --> 59:30.750
you're looking at maybe not
antiques and furniture

59:30.834 --> 59:33.917
from that Victorian period,
because they would often

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
have them maybe
50 or 100 years earlier.

59:37.250 --> 59:39.959
So, you're looking
at really fine antiques.

all his hunting trophies,

59:44.208 --> 59:45.500

It speaks to his power, I think.

MICHELE CLAPTON: I suppose
you can say Massen is a villain.

59:51.709 --> 59:54.041
In modern day,
he looks like a villain

59:54.125 --> 59:55.583
in his black
and his high collar.

59:55.667 --> 59:57.458
Actually, that was just
what men wore then.

59:57.709 --> 1:00:00.291
I love the way the men
have to hold their head

1:00:00.375 --> 1:00:02.417
with these incredibly
high collars sometimes.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.875
What I really enjoy is,
as a costume develops,

1:00:05.959 --> 1:00:07.166
you see the character emerge.

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:09.333
Particularly Amalia,
with the corset.

1:00:09.834 --> 1:00:11.208
It was incredibly important

1:00:11.291 --> 1:00:15.208
that she would really want
to be controlled and precise.

1:00:15.709 --> 1:00:20.291
Some anarchic cabal
found or developed a power

1:00:20.375 --> 1:00:21.291

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:23.542
It was an attack on the empire.

1:00:24.709 --> 1:00:25.709
So we're at war.

1:00:26.375 --> 1:00:28.959
Massen doesn't believe
that the Touched

1:00:29.041 --> 1:00:31.792
represent progress
of any good kind.

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:35.083
He is the living,
breathing embodiment

1:00:35.166 --> 1:00:36.125
of the patriarchy,

1:00:36.208 --> 1:00:39.959
and power as it exists
in that society.

1:00:40.542 --> 1:00:43.792
Massen embodies that empire
and the values of that empire,

1:00:43.875 --> 1:00:45.792
and if that means
people being sacrificed,

1:00:45.875 --> 1:00:47.667
then that's the way
it's gonna go.

1:00:48.125 --> 1:00:50.333
Massen, I suppose,
is fundamentally a bad guy,

1:00:50.417 --> 1:00:52.792
in that he's about
destroying the Touched.

1:00:52.875 --> 1:00:54.709
We always ask ourselves
about villains,

1:00:54.792 --> 1:00:56.417
"How do they get
to be like this?"

1:00:56.959 --> 1:00:59.333
With Massen,
he lost his wife young,

1:00:59.583 --> 1:01:01.583
and now he's lost a child.

1:01:02.750 --> 1:01:04.875
So, that makes him
rather compelling.

1:01:05.417 --> 1:01:07.166
If you have a personal tragedy,

1:01:07.250 --> 1:01:08.959
all that does is fortify

1:01:09.041 --> 1:01:11.458
your allegiance
to the larger force.

1:01:11.542 --> 1:01:14.041
So, the larger British Empire
for Massen.

1:01:14.917 --> 1:01:16.500
DONNELLY:
There's a regular power play

1:01:16.583 --> 1:01:18.333
between Massen and Amalia.

1:01:18.417 --> 1:01:21.166
He's the old power,
she represents the new power,

1:01:21.250 --> 1:01:23.917
and neither one of them
is gonna give that up easily.

1:01:24.250 --> 1:01:29.041
So, I think she comes out
of there feeling frustrated...

1:01:29.417 --> 1:01:30.834
and angry.

1:01:30.917 --> 1:01:32.792
So he confessed
without confessing?

1:01:32.875 --> 1:01:34.083
It was honestly impressive.

1:01:34.750 --> 1:01:38.625
DONNELLY: Amalia is looking
for how she is supposed

1:01:38.709 --> 1:01:42.542
to be moving forward,
but she really is quite lost.

1:01:42.917 --> 1:01:44.709
I was left here
completely alone

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.250
with nothing but a mission
I was never actually given.

1:01:47.333 --> 1:01:50.375
DONNELLY:
She is learning where to find

1:01:50.792 --> 1:01:53.291
the information that she needs,
and the thing that...

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:56.542
really sets that in motion,
first of all, of course, is--

1:01:56.625 --> 1:01:58.291
is hearing Mary's song.

1:01:59.041 --> 1:02:02.709
Myrtle's turn is she can
speak every language,

1:02:02.792 --> 1:02:04.375
she can understand
every language.

1:02:04.458 --> 1:02:08.166
So she does understand
everything Mary's saying.

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:12.000
And she also knows
she cannot say what it means.

1:02:12.083 --> 1:02:14.500
She can't communicate that
with anyone.

1:02:15.041 --> 1:02:18.333
And she knows that
this is life-changing

1:02:18.417 --> 1:02:19.959
for everyone around her.

1:02:20.041 --> 1:02:23.208
When Mary sang,
you heard words, language.

1:02:23.834 --> 1:02:27.041
Primrose and Harriet
kind of seize this opportunity.

1:02:27.125 --> 1:02:28.750
She's trying
to communicate with us

1:02:28.834 --> 1:02:30.959
what she heard Mary sing.

1:02:31.166 --> 1:02:35.750
We tried really hard to include
as many as we could.

1:02:35.834 --> 1:02:37.458
You know, Asian languages,

1:02:37.667 --> 1:02:40.500
Afro languages,
European languages.

1:02:41.041 --> 1:02:43.834
It was a little bit
dictated by...

1:02:44.333 --> 1:02:46.417
what contacts we had.

1:02:46.834 --> 1:02:49.500
(SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE)

1:02:49.959 --> 1:02:53.792
Viola is a remarkable person,
because she's so good

1:02:53.875 --> 1:02:58.417
at picking up the sounds
and the rhythms of a language,

1:02:58.500 --> 1:02:59.667
and the tune of a language.

1:02:59.750 --> 1:03:02.000
She kind of absorbs that very,
very quickly.

1:03:02.250 --> 1:03:05.792
(SPEAKS ITALIAN THEN DUTCH)

1:03:05.875 --> 1:03:07.125
Myrtle...

1:03:07.208 --> 1:03:08.208
A little slower.

1:03:08.625 --> 1:03:10.959
But I think we both felt
we want to do justice here,

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:13.417
if we're going to use
a bit of Afrikaans,

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:15.291
if we're going to use
a bit of Dutch,

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:16.917
or Turkish, or whatever it is,

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.417
we want to try
and do that justice.

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.041
(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN)

1:03:24.125 --> 1:03:28.291
So, I put out an email
to the whole crew.

1:03:28.375 --> 1:03:31.375
The response was phenomenal!
Loads of people got involved,

1:03:31.458 --> 1:03:35.083
and translated pieces
of script for us.

1:03:35.750 --> 1:03:39.458
We had something like 30,
40 languages.

1:03:39.542 --> 1:03:40.625
I just thought it was fantastic.

1:03:40.709 --> 1:03:42.709
It was really joyous,
this coming together.

1:03:43.041 --> 1:03:46.375
VIOLA PRETTEJOHN:
It's sadly quite unusual
in the world

1:03:46.458 --> 1:03:49.125
for so many different cultures
to come together

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:50.834
and help each other.

1:03:50.917 --> 1:03:53.542
We had some very,
very interesting debates,

1:03:53.625 --> 1:03:56.625
you know. I'd say,
"Oh, um, can you say,

1:03:57.083 --> 1:04:00.125
'Because of the darkness,'"
and people would say,

1:04:00.208 --> 1:04:02.834
"When you say 'darkness',
what do you mean?

1:04:02.917 --> 1:04:07.458
Do you mean total black?
Do you mean night-time?"

1:04:08.041 --> 1:04:10.125
-SPEAKER: I know it. "Darkness."
-SPEAKER 2: "Dark..."

1:04:10.208 --> 1:04:12.208
And, um, "before the dark?"

1:04:12.291 --> 1:04:14.291
Uh, "Come before the dark."

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:15.208
Si!

1:04:15.291 --> 1:04:16.458
That's so incredible,

1:04:16.542 --> 1:04:18.083
that we're going
into this detail.

1:04:18.166 --> 1:04:19.917
And you suddenly realize that

1:04:20.333 --> 1:04:22.625
English has some words
that cover some things,

1:04:22.709 --> 1:04:25.208
but other languages
have amazing words.

1:04:25.834 --> 1:04:26.959
KIRAN SAWAR:
It's just really exciting,

1:04:27.291 --> 1:04:28.792
'cause it's the coming together
of a lot of different people

1:04:28.875 --> 1:04:30.208
who speak a lot
of different languages,

1:04:30.291 --> 1:04:31.667
and can't necessarily
communicate

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:33.041
with one another clearly,

1:04:33.291 --> 1:04:37.125
but still have the ability
to do it, regardless.

1:04:37.458 --> 1:04:39.959
DONNELLY: They were able to
find out what Mary's song meant,

1:04:40.041 --> 1:04:41.792
so that's finally a message.

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:42.792
What did she say?

1:04:43.291 --> 1:04:46.959
She said, "You're not alone."
She said it to you, Mrs. True.

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:53.125
And "There's a darkness."
She said to everyone, all of us.

1:04:53.333 --> 1:04:58.709
So, it's really just a kind of
blind scrape through the dark

1:04:58.792 --> 1:04:59.834
to get where she needs to get,

1:05:00.125 --> 1:05:02.667
in the hope that there is
some light at the end of that.

1:05:03.542 --> 1:05:05.667
-Was there more?
-"Find me."

1:05:07.166 --> 1:05:08.625
Who do we need to find?
