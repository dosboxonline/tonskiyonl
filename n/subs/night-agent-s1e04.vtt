WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:10.093
[Rose] The deputy director of the FBI
was just murdered <i>Godfather</i>-style.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.346
I'm not stepping into that White House
and just handing over their drive.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.889
Not till we know who we can trust.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.100
[suspenseful music playing]

00:17.100 --> 00:18.727
- You still have the hard drive?
- Yeah.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.479
That's priority one.
Peter. Where have you been?

00:23.231 --> 00:25.108
I found this on the air gap.

00:25.108 --> 00:28.153
The question now is,
can you still convince me to trust you?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.157
There you are.
I think I found something. Check this out.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.074
Rose, I...

00:33.074 --> 00:35.285
- What the fuck is she doing here?
- She's on our side.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.955
[Rose] I heard my aunt say someone
in the White House couldn't be trusted.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.833
How long have they worked for you?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.835
Him, over eight years. Excellent results.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.421
He brought her in a couple of years ago.
They make a good team.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.298
Wanna see our new home?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
What are you looking for here?

00:49.758 --> 00:52.886
I thought maybe
we'll try this for a little while.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.220
See what it's like.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.847
Play house with me.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.307
I'm sending a replacement.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.266
<i>Erik Monks.</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:01.019
I wanted to introduce you
to a new member of the security team.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.896
This is Erik. Erik, Maddie Redfield.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.648
You may have heard of him.
He saved the last president years ago.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.609
- You're the guy who got shot?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.235
How'd a guy who saved POTUS

01:09.235 --> 01:11.404
get stuck on
the vice president's daughter's detail?

01:11.404 --> 01:14.657
Physical therapy.
It, uh, it took a while after I got shot.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.452
I guess this is their way
of easing an old man back in.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.661
[Chelsea] I need a favor.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.330
I need to know why a national hero

01:20.330 --> 01:23.416
got assigned to the most thankless detail
in the whole Secret Service.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.542
[music fades]

01:26.044 --> 01:28.046
[ominous music playing]

01:36.930 --> 01:39.182
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [woman] <i>Daredevil arriving now.</i>

01:39.682 --> 01:41.226
Copy that. Floor is clear.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.228
[woman] <i>Got some interference. Go again.</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:45.855
Floor is clear.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.524
[indistinct chatter]

01:47.524 --> 01:49.692
- [machines whirring]
- [objects clattering]

01:51.528 --> 01:53.113
[crowd applauding, cheering]

01:53.113 --> 01:56.741
[woman 2] Mr. President,
thank you for supporting union workers.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.328
[man] Mr. President.
Nice to meet you, sir.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.040
[man 2] Mr. President, over here!

02:04.040 --> 02:05.125
[man 3] Mr. President!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.502
[man 4] Mr. President,
you're the only reason

02:07.502 --> 02:09.921
that we're able
to keep this facility stateside.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.215
Every worker here
would like to shake your hand.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.884
- [man 5] Thank you, Mr. President!
- Eyes on the beard at 12 o'clock.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.136
[woman] <i>Monks, your radio--</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:18.847
[president] Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.057
This is what American-made looks like.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.184
- Keep up the great work.
- [suspenseful music playing]

02:23.184 --> 02:25.520
[president] You know, when I was a boy,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.773
a union job at the plant
meant honest hours...

02:28.773 --> 02:32.360
The guy with the beard.
Someone check out what he's doing.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.570
[woman] <i>What was that?</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:35.113
[Erik] He's assembling something.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.199
It provides good wages, health, safety--

02:38.199 --> 02:39.576
[Erik] Gun!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.786
[crowd gasping, screaming]

02:41.786 --> 02:43.538
[men grunting]

02:44.122 --> 02:46.124
[indistinct chatter]

02:46.124 --> 02:48.209
[intense music playing]

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
[opening theme music playing]

02:58.052 --> 03:00.722
[Erik humming]

03:06.394 --> 03:07.395
[knocking on door]

03:07.395 --> 03:08.313
Come in.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.859
[toilet clattering]

03:17.155 --> 03:19.574
[objects clattering]

03:19.574 --> 03:21.701
- Can I help you find something?
- [Chelsea] Pills.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.203
Why?

03:23.703 --> 03:24.954
You got a headache?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.957
I know you're an addict.
I know they forced you into rehab,

03:27.957 --> 03:30.752
and I know that if you were
anyone other than the boss's old partner,

03:30.752 --> 03:33.213
they'd never have put
your ass back on a detail.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.507
- I miss anything?
- No, you're mostly right.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.053
Getting shot,
that started me on painkillers.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.263
It wouldn't look good to have me wash out,

03:42.263 --> 03:45.183
so they said if I stayed clean
for a year, that I could...

03:45.183 --> 03:46.434
[sighing heavily]

03:46.434 --> 03:47.936
...I could start back at the bottom.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.480
That's gotta be
the biggest boys' club bullshit

03:50.480 --> 03:51.522
I've ever heard.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.234
You said "mostly right."

03:54.984 --> 03:55.818
Yeah.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.031
You said I <i>was</i> an addict.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.284
I still am. Always will be.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.995
That supposed to make me feel
any more confident in your abilities?

04:05.995 --> 04:08.581
It's not supposed
to make you feel anything. It's the truth.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.251
It is also true that I am clean now.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.378
I get tested twice a week to prove it.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.631
The vice president know
an addict's protecting his daughter?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.509
I didn't think so.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.637
So tell him, then.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.722
[dramatic music playing]

04:27.350 --> 04:28.893
Drum me out.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.853
All it takes is one phone call.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.606
Listen, you're ambitious.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.984
You wanna move up the ranks

04:35.984 --> 04:38.027
and get on the president's detail
one day, right?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.446
Well, maybe I can help you get there.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.657
- How's that?
<i>-</i> I can teach you things.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.075
Teach me things?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.120
- Like a mentor?
- Yeah.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.415
An old, slow, drug-addicted mentor?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.250
Yeah.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.671
I grew up around junkies
in East St. Louis.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.508
My uncle, he went into recovery,

05:00.508 --> 05:03.594
found Jesus,
got a job at the local supermarket,

05:03.594 --> 05:05.305
stayed sober until the day he died.

05:05.305 --> 05:09.559
Religion works for some people,
meditation for others.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.227
It was the job that did it for him.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.770
I'm glad you got clean.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.564
Hope you stay clean.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.649
But you can't do this job
for the wrong reasons.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.775
[door opening]

05:17.775 --> 05:19.902
- I don't disagree.
- Good.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.823
'Cause the stakes here are a lot
fucking higher than "paper or plastic."

05:24.824 --> 05:25.742
[door closing]

05:28.286 --> 05:30.538
[Rose] Okay, let's just say
I buy what you're selling.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.124
That means whoever
had my aunt and uncle killed

05:33.124 --> 05:35.209
did it because of what's
on this hard drive.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.627
Which is exactly why I need it.

05:36.627 --> 05:37.754
Then what?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.840
Who could you possibly show it to
if you can't trust anyone you work with?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.258
I can trust the president.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.843
You sure about that?

05:43.843 --> 05:47.263
President Travers has been my friend
since she ran for state rep.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.641
We've worked together almost 23 years.
I know exactly who she is.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.018
Think about the facts.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.811
Travers started the Night Action,

05:53.811 --> 05:57.065
she knew your aunt and uncle,
requested them specifically.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.192
If anyone's on your side here, it's her.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.652
But if she hadn't put them
on this Night Action, then--

06:01.652 --> 06:03.529
Then the truth
would never have been found.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.573
Your aunt and uncle were patriots, Rose.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.117
They knew the risks
associated with this assignment.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.952
Now we need to finish their work.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.579
I'll finish it, then.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.663
Excuse me?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.581
Me and Peter.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.458
Let us figure this out.

06:15.458 --> 06:19.379
It's the only way I'm gonna feel safe.
I'm not giving this hard drive to anyone.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.923
When we walked in,
you said you found something. What?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.050
[tense music playing]

06:24.634 --> 06:26.552
- An address.
- Address for what?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.349
How about this?
I'm going to leave here without the drive.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.685
You two go to that address
and find out whatever you can.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.106
In the meantime, I'll figure out
how to present this plan to the president

06:38.106 --> 06:40.608
in a way that doesn't sound
incredibly reckless.

06:43.736 --> 06:44.779
Uh,

06:44.779 --> 06:47.073
does "Osprey" mean anything to you?

06:47.657 --> 06:50.451
Osprey? Like the bird? No. Why?

06:50.451 --> 06:55.331
I heard my uncle mention
that he needed to warn Osprey.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.958
It must be a code name.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.293
Let me look into it.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.464
Don't let her out of your sight,
not even for a minute.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.465
Yes, ma'am.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.017
[suspenseful music playing]

07:17.645 --> 07:20.064
[Rose] Those two psychos
are still coming for us.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.150
There are no tails. We're good.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.152
Why didn't you call me
before you brought her?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.486
Why spring that on me?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.905
I couldn't risk the killers
tracking you, okay?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.032
Well, I would have rather known.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.743
I got it. No more surprises.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.956
Find anything else on the drive?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.416
Thousands of files.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.961
What do you know about Omar Zadar?

07:41.961 --> 07:45.006
He's a Balkan dissident who heads up
the People's Independence Front.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.468
When the PIF claimed responsibility
for the metro attack, he denied it.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.220
Even Farr told me the president
never bought that he was involved.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.221
What do you think?

07:52.972 --> 07:53.806
No idea.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.768
People say he's gone legit
now that he's running for office, but...

07:58.269 --> 08:00.354
I mean, his group bombed buildings
in the past, so...

08:00.354 --> 08:04.734
Either way, PIF, there was never any proof
they were involved in the metro attack.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.195
Maybe Emma and Henry found some evidence.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.531
There's a folder
with his name on it on the drive.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.908
Any other names?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.702
Well, I did a search
for "Farr" and "Hawkins." Nothing.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.455
Seems, uh...

08:18.539 --> 08:20.666
seems sort of weird
that an engineering company

08:20.666 --> 08:22.502
would be all the way out here, doesn't it?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.256
[birds chirping]

08:29.342 --> 08:31.177
[cicadas chittering]

08:31.177 --> 08:32.428
[car approaching]

09:03.251 --> 09:04.168
Can I help you?

09:04.168 --> 09:06.796
Good morning, ma'am.
I'm Peter Sutherland. This is--

09:06.796 --> 09:07.713
[woman] Hands.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.675
- Excuse me?
- Show me your hands, please.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.057
Uh, do you know Emma and Henry Campbell?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.642
No. Should I?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.144
We were hoping to speak with an engineer
who worked with them.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.939
- We're investigating a--
- Uh, for a news article.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.525
Uh, we work with the <i>Richmond Daily News</i>.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.236
You got the wrong person. Sorry.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.113
Uh, wait, ma'am, please.
If we could just ask--

09:32.113 --> 09:35.366
There is nothing you could ask
that I would have any answers to.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.284
[Rose gasping]

09:36.867 --> 09:40.371
I live alone.
I don't know any Ellas or Harrys,

09:41.080 --> 09:44.125
and I don't believe for a second
this one here is a journalist.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.459
Now, please,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.004
turn around and be on your way.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.215
Come on.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.309
What?

10:04.895 --> 10:07.857
There is a rusted old wagon
behind the barn, right?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.275
No.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.612
- Well, there used to be?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.615
I came here as a kid.
I... I rode a pony over that ridge.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.993
I fell over, and I hurt my ankle,
and I cried,

10:18.993 --> 10:23.581
and I made magic cookie bars
with my Aunt Emma and another woman.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.250
Was that you?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.753
[tense music playing]

10:29.587 --> 10:30.755
Were you followed?

10:30.755 --> 10:31.672
No.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.260
Come inside, then.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.185
Take off your shoes.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.186
House rule.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.396
[door creaking]

10:49.065 --> 10:51.901
[birds chirping]

10:54.445 --> 10:55.321
I'm Rose.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.238
I know.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.198
Lorna.

11:00.409 --> 11:04.997
[narrator] <i>The hyena is one of the more
curious residents of the Savannah.</i>

11:08.417 --> 11:10.795
Why did you say
you didn't know Emma and Henry?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.713
Why did you say you were reporters?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.715
Actually, I'm an FBI agent.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.966
No shit.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.510
What a shock.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.637
When was the last time that you saw them?

11:19.637 --> 11:20.888
It's been years. Why?

11:21.597 --> 11:23.641
They were murdered three days ago.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.229
- Where?
- In their home.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.525
I was there too. I barely made it out.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.276
I hadn't heard.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.196
[Peter] Really?
It's been all over the news.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.074
I stopped watching
what passes for the news a while ago.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.367
How did you escape?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.535
I had help.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.704
I'm so sorry.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.665
- Emma and Henry--
- I know they were spies.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.836
We found one of their hard drives,
and some of the files led us here.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.840
- The dates suggest that you were in touch.
- And?

11:55.840 --> 11:59.135
Ma'am, you may not be aware of this.
This is a matter of national security.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.845
- Is that right?
- [Peter] Yes.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.305
Well, in that case,
I will tell you my whole life story.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.599
You think maybe
you could remove the sidearm

12:05.599 --> 12:07.184
before coming into my house

12:07.184 --> 12:10.062
and lecturing me
about national fucking security?

12:11.355 --> 12:13.774
It's fine. I'm just--
I'm just making a point.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.360
- Which is?
- You've no idea what you're getting into.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.070
So tell us, please.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.530
The only thing I'm certain of,

12:19.530 --> 12:21.824
is the more you know,
the more dangerous this becomes.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.908
We're past that, okay?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.494
We know someone in the White House
has turned traitor.

12:25.494 --> 12:29.081
Whoever that is, we know
that they were part of the metro bombing,

12:29.957 --> 12:31.041
and we think that

12:31.792 --> 12:33.502
another attack is about to happen.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.381
So, please,
if... if they said anything to you--

12:37.381 --> 12:38.299
They didn't.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.552
My job was to collect the intel,
not analyze it.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.346
I'm supposed to be retired.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.515
But then again, so were they.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.142
What kind of intel were they after?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.019
Blueprints.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.104
Public infrastructure, building permits.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.857
I used to be a civil engineer,
so I had the contacts.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.526
I don't know why they needed it.
I knew not to ask.

12:57.526 --> 13:01.238
But you must have noticed something,
like a pattern, or, like, a detail.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.783
- Why?
- You're the only lead we have left.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.410
Look, I've been on the run for three days.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.830
The people who killed my aunt and uncle,
they're after me now.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.125
Please just tell us something, anything.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.794
[dramatic music playing]

13:15.461 --> 13:17.046
They were wonderful friends.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.590
Loyal.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.305
The files I supplied
dealt with city services,

13:26.305 --> 13:27.973
but there were other files they wanted.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.643
Schematics of buildings,
all in the same block.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.560
Where?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.479
- You won't understand.
- What do you mean?

13:33.479 --> 13:36.106
I mean, you can't understand
the files without me.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.983
They're complicated schematics.

13:38.567 --> 13:42.488
So... I guess we're going for a ride.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.744
[indistinct chatter]

13:59.880 --> 14:01.090
What are you drawing?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.216
A girl.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.219
A young woman, actually.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.138
Is it someone you know?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.267
[man] Somebody I'd like to know better.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.813
[Maddie] Well,
I'd love to see it when you're done.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.398
I'd be happy to show you

14:18.566 --> 14:20.067
when I'm done.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.737
[brushes clattering]

14:23.737 --> 14:25.656
[Maddie sighing]

14:28.450 --> 14:29.285
[man sighing]

14:33.998 --> 14:35.249
How's it coming?

14:37.459 --> 14:38.544
I don't know.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.548
Might need some help.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.218
You don't need any help.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.512
A little encouragement, maybe.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.348
Um,

14:52.808 --> 14:56.812
I'm not quite sure about the colors.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.023
Don't second-guess yourself.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.903
I like this bit here.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.156
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.703
Well, what do you like most about it?

15:15.205 --> 15:16.123
The layering.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.627
[whispering] The, uh,

15:20.878 --> 15:22.129
the brushstrokes.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
The you in it.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.769
You have incredible instincts, Maddie.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.730
Trust them.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.329
I'm sorry.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.040
- Why?
- It was inappropriate of me.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.249
No, it's not.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.752
[both breathing heavily]

16:03.671 --> 16:05.673
God, this... this is a mistake.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.259
I shouldn't have, okay?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.136
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
[tense music playing]

16:21.522 --> 16:23.524
I met them at Middlebury College.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.401
Middlebury?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
My aunt went to Vassar.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
This was
the summer language program at Mid.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.117
Emma was in my Russian intensive.
Henry was taking Arabic.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.494
I don't know
exactly when they joined the FBI,

16:35.494 --> 16:38.706
but I do know
they were recruited as a team.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.749
After that summer, we went our own ways.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.168
I had a normal career,

16:44.211 --> 16:46.922
but after doing some side work for them,
they made some introductions.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.009
I carved out a niche
in intelligence gathering.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.177
Wait, my... my aunt spoke Russian?

16:52.803 --> 16:53.804
Very well.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.974
She even recruited
a couple of Russians to our side.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.559
You didn't hear that from me.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.852
This is crazy.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.145
They acted like nobodies

17:01.145 --> 17:04.314
who went to garage sales
and took cruises every summer.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.525
They weren't on cruises.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.903
So their whole life was a lie?

17:09.903 --> 17:10.946
Not a lie.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.072
A secret.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.366
One that allows you
to see things differently,

17:14.366 --> 17:15.617
empowers you.

17:16.785 --> 17:17.703
It's important work.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.330
But no one knows who you really are.
What kind of life is that?

17:20.330 --> 17:22.082
The kind that's fucking great.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.216
Does the, uh, code name Osprey
mean anything to you?

17:32.176 --> 17:33.010
No.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.305
- Okay.
- How did you get mixed up in all this?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.015
Oh, he works in the White House.

17:38.599 --> 17:43.145
When I called the emergency number
my uncle gave me, Peter answered.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.730
White-glove service.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.690
I'm just a guy who answers the phone.

17:46.690 --> 17:51.528
Uh-huh. So Pete Sutherland's boy
works the Night Action line.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.698
Wait, you knew my father?

17:54.698 --> 17:55.616
No.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.536
- But you were on the metro that night?
- Yeah.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.579
Yeah, I was.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.415
Take the next exit.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.174
This is the place.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.510
Something either happened
or is gonna happen on this block.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.345
At least Emma and Henry thought so.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.513
[car horns honking]

18:17.513 --> 18:18.972
[Peter] No obvious targets.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.809
Are there any government buildings
around here, contractors?

18:21.809 --> 18:22.726
[Lorna] No.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.770
[siren wailing]

18:24.770 --> 18:26.188
Can we get off the street?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.357
It doesn't feel safe out here.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.691
There's a café.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.569
I'll walk you through the files.
See if we can figure out what they mean.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.488
I'll meet you guys back here
in ten minutes.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.657
- I'm gonna have a look around.
- Good thinking.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.327
This portion of the grid covers this area.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.912
There's the nearest hub.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.457
Why would my aunt and uncle want intel
on power grids and gas lines?

18:45.457 --> 18:48.001
Searching for vulnerabilities.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.711
Sabotage targets, maybe.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.632
But what's important enough
to be a target around here?

18:54.133 --> 18:54.967
Got me.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.302
Okay, what's "video footage"?

18:57.302 --> 18:58.846
That's not mine. Gimme.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.514
[indistinct chatter]

19:00.514 --> 19:02.224
Looks like traffic cameras.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.684
Security footage.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.270
There's a folder
for every address on the block.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.105
There's even one for this place.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.986
Okay. What were they looking for?

19:15.612 --> 19:16.905
How long have you known him?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.450
Peter? Um, just a few days.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.161
You know about his father, right?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.871
And what he was accused of?

19:24.371 --> 19:26.790
- Some. Why?
- You don't think it's strange?

19:27.332 --> 19:30.460
He was on the metro when the bomb blew,
now he's investigating it.

19:31.044 --> 19:31.920
So? [chuckling]

19:31.920 --> 19:34.464
So... search the drive for his name.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.841
Why?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.634
Because I don't like coincidences.

19:37.634 --> 19:38.969
Neither should you.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.972
- Okay.
- [keyboard clacking]

19:41.972 --> 19:43.473
[door opening]

19:43.473 --> 19:44.683
Hey. You find anything?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.436
- [door closing]
- No. You?

19:47.436 --> 19:50.564
Just a dentist office,
some accountant buildings. Nothing.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.317
Everything okay?

19:53.317 --> 19:54.568
Yeah. Oh!

19:55.360 --> 19:58.572
Uh, would you mind getting
some paper towels from the bathroom?

19:59.156 --> 20:01.116
- Yeah, of course.
- Man, I'm such a--

20:04.286 --> 20:05.954
That was a bit dramatic.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.248
[keyboard clacking]

20:12.252 --> 20:13.086
Nothing.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.713
Feel better?

20:14.713 --> 20:15.756
Maybe.

20:16.506 --> 20:17.341
You?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.719
[door squeaking]

20:25.390 --> 20:27.601
[low rumbling]

20:27.601 --> 20:29.686
[tense music playing]

20:30.395 --> 20:32.522
Excuse me. Is that the metro I just felt?

20:32.522 --> 20:34.608
Yeah. Runs right underneath here.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.863
- [Lorna] Thanks.
- What if it was a mistake?

20:39.863 --> 20:40.781
What?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.157
The metro bombing.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.284
Look.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.620
The bomb detonated here, right?

20:46.620 --> 20:48.747
That's just because I stopped the train.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.083
What if it was meant
to explode someplace else?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.000
What, like here?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.796
But there's no other metro stops nearby.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.757
Yeah, no stops, but the tunnel runs
directly under Wilson Boulevard.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.801
I felt it
shake the hell out of the bathroom.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.302
[Rose] Okay, what's the difference

21:02.302 --> 21:05.889
between a bomb going off
in one location versus another?

21:05.889 --> 21:08.475
- Maybe it's closer to street level here.
- It isn't.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.019
Bring up the neighborhood
schematics again.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.648
[keyboard clacking]

21:14.648 --> 21:18.777
Okay, there's a major gas line
that bisects a train tunnel.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.405
If it did go off under here,
what would happen?

21:21.405 --> 21:25.784
If something were to hit that gas main,
it'd take out two full city blocks.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.704
But why here though?

21:28.704 --> 21:29.955
I don't know.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.083
When you got on the metro that night,
you prevented something.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.836
You wanna know what this traitor
in the White House is planning?

21:35.836 --> 21:39.339
You need to determine what they failed
to accomplish a year ago here.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.468
Bro. You know you gotta pay for that map.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.640
Okay, what about...?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.475
That one is Charlotte.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.478
Harper.

21:54.146 --> 21:54.980
Harper, right.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.357
Badger can only take her in small doses.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.483
Me, even smaller.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.448
- You blend right in, don't you?
- That's the idea.

22:05.907 --> 22:06.908
Badger likes you.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.994
Didn't your POTUS like you?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.579
Oh, he liked me fine.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.664
Never posted selfies with me.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.543
For a second, I thought you might be
paying me a compliment.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.712
Everyone's got their own style.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.506
That's right. And my style is the reason
I'm the only team leader

22:21.506 --> 22:23.925
Maddie hasn't burned or gotten fired.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.678
It's not because I blend.
It's because I understand her.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.930
I get it. You're her friend.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.767

35:27.959 --> 35:29.418
I don't know, I shelled up.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.255
I'm in my own head a lot as it is.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.715
You know, if I'm being honest, I, um...

35:36.759 --> 35:38.678
should've probably talked
to her a little more

35:38.678 --> 35:41.180
about what I was going through,

35:41.180 --> 35:43.933
considering I wanted to spend
my life with her, but I...

35:44.976 --> 35:49.313
Well, I don't think
people need to be constantly talking

35:49.313 --> 35:50.606
to be tuned into each other.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.900
You see those old couples in restaurants,

35:52.900 --> 35:56.445
they don't say a word the whole time,
and I think they seem pretty happy.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.072
Yeah, nothing left to say.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.033
I don't think that's it.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.453
I think there's an understanding.

36:06.247 --> 36:11.627
They're just comfortable
together in the silence.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.840
[contemplative music playing]

36:21.262 --> 36:23.347
Look, I can get another room.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.849
It's not that big a deal.

36:24.849 --> 36:25.892
I know.

36:27.226 --> 36:28.352
Any more syrups?

36:28.352 --> 36:31.189
Here you go. How many do you...
how many do you need?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.816
[both chuckling]

36:33.816 --> 36:35.109
You know, I'm, uh--

36:35.109 --> 36:39.197
I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to your cat.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.032
Poor Whiskers.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.575
That was his name?

36:42.575 --> 36:43.534
Her name.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.912
[both laughing]

36:51.959 --> 36:53.961
[Peter snoring]

37:10.603 --> 37:12.605
[dramatic music playing]

37:18.653 --> 37:19.695
[man grunting]

37:20.196 --> 37:21.739
She took longer than expected.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.782
[man panting]

37:23.991 --> 37:24.909
Yeah.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.328
I knew she wouldn't go easy.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.082
She was a real pro, huh?

37:32.083 --> 37:32.959
She was.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.297
My turn.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.051
[birds chirping, squawking]

37:51.477 --> 37:54.397
Morning. You snore.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.356
[Peter chuckling]

37:56.148 --> 37:58.067
Yeah, I've been, uh, I've been told.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.070
- I wake you up?
- Just a couple of times.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.905
[Peter] Shit, sorry.

38:02.905 --> 38:03.823
It's okay.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.326
Glad you finally got some sleep.

38:07.326 --> 38:08.536
Yeah, same.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.664
You find something new
on the, uh, surveillance feed?

38:11.664 --> 38:12.707
Not that I can see.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.126
The date range is the week
leading up to the bombing,

38:15.126 --> 38:18.379
so I'm basically profiling anyone
who looks remotely sketchy.

38:18.379 --> 38:22.758
Was there ever a suspect
for the metro bombing?

38:22.758 --> 38:24.010
Besides me?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.177
I'm serious.

38:25.678 --> 38:26.887
Yeah, actually.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.601
He had a, uh, black jacket over a hoodie.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.188
Couldn't really see his face though.

38:38.524 --> 38:39.942
Almost caught him too.

38:39.942 --> 38:41.569
[tense music playing]

38:41.569 --> 38:45.990
He had a, uh,
rattlesnake tattoo on his side.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.495
I told the investigators, but they were
never able to identify anybody.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.164
Okay.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.166
Black jacket. I'm on it.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.459
[cell phone vibrating]

38:59.462 --> 39:00.421
[Peter sighing]

39:01.213 --> 39:02.131
[Peter sniffling]

39:08.471 --> 39:09.972
[phone line ringing]

39:09.972 --> 39:12.475
- [Diane] <i>Peter.</i>
- Hey. Is this the new number?

39:12.475 --> 39:13.392
You were right.

39:13.392 --> 39:16.729
Secret Service found spyware on my cell.
That must be how they tracked you.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.939
<i>Switch burners after this,
then text me your new number.</i>

39:18.939 --> 39:21.150
- [Peter] Yeah, will do.
- [Diane] <i>How are you two?</i>

39:21.150 --> 39:22.735
<i>That address turn up anything?</i>

39:22.735 --> 39:24.320
We think the Campbells found evidence

39:24.320 --> 39:26.280
that the metro bomb
was for a different target.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.239
What do you mean?

39:27.239 --> 39:28.574
Something above ground.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.243
I'm confused.
That line doesn't run above ground.

39:31.243 --> 39:34.747
I'll explain it better in person,
but we think there will be another attack.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.831
Jesus.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.501
Peter, we need to share this with the FBI.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.503
<i>End of day, understood?</i>

39:41.170 --> 39:42.004
Understood.

39:52.431 --> 39:53.849
[Erik] Does this open?

39:53.849 --> 39:58.646
It's just office hours.
I'm in here every day.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.565
Okay, we're good.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.157
You got your panic button?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.868
[unsettling music playing]

40:15.830 --> 40:17.498
Yes. Thanks.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.375
[dramatic music playing]

40:22.503 --> 40:25.005
- [door closing]
- Sorry, the new guy's extra.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.757
Nah, it's his job to protect you.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.759
Like a warden to his inmates.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.598
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.767
I feel bad about yesterday,

40:36.767 --> 40:40.062
and I just don't want you
to be, like, freaked out or--

40:41.981 --> 40:44.150
[both breathing heavily]

40:44.150 --> 40:45.234
I shouldn't be doing this.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.903
We need to keep talking,
or he might start to think that--

40:47.903 --> 40:49.405
That this is happening.

40:52.741 --> 40:57.204
If someone finds out, I'll lose my job,
and you'll be in the middle of a scandal.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.664
I can't do that to you.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.126
Well, what if we could be alone
for a couple hours?

41:02.626 --> 41:04.670
Somewhere private, maybe your place?

41:04.670 --> 41:05.629
Right.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.507
And Secret Service
will just wait outside the door while we--

41:08.507 --> 41:09.633
While we what?

41:12.970 --> 41:14.722
No one can find out about this.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.307
No one.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.810
You told me to trust my instincts.
You should too.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.190
I can ditch the agents.
I've done it before.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.067
I... I swear, we'll be all alone

41:29.236 --> 41:31.238
If it's what you want.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.743
[dramatic music playing]

41:37.328 --> 41:39.330
[both breathing heavily]

41:44.084 --> 41:45.544
[Chelsea] How's the shoulder?

41:45.544 --> 41:47.213
All good. Thanks.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.590
I'm curious.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.843
What did it feel like,
taking that hit in Ohio?

41:55.846 --> 41:58.057
Um, it hurt.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.559
I mean, I know that sounds obvious,

42:00.559 --> 42:03.270
but I remember
being weirdly surprised by that.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.523
Not exactly sure what I expected,

42:05.523 --> 42:09.109
but I guess some people black out,
some go into shock.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.027
Me?

42:11.362 --> 42:13.405
All I remember is the pain.

42:13.405 --> 42:14.615
Would you do it again?

42:19.161 --> 42:23.249
Listen, maybe I do need this job
to stay clean, all right?

42:24.667 --> 42:25.584
Maybe I do.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.921
But that still doesn't mean
that I'm not up to it.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.549
The bar was a mistake. I own that.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.217
Don't question my commitment.

42:34.051 --> 42:37.263
My approach is different than yours
and maybe even antiquated,

42:37.263 --> 42:39.181
but I will adapt.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.184
Here comes Harper.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.727
Hey. How's it going?

42:49.775 --> 42:50.943
[keyboard clacking]

42:51.443 --> 42:54.905
No suspicious black jackets on video
in the days leading up to the attack.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.323
What about the morning of?

42:56.323 --> 42:57.741
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.120
Just some woman
sitting in that café for five hours,

43:01.120 --> 43:03.747
staring out the window
and talking to herself.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.500
Show me.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.377
[tense music playing]

43:08.377 --> 43:09.461
[keyboard clacking]

43:12.548 --> 43:15.259
She's not talking to herself.
She's talking into a mic.

43:15.884 --> 43:16.719
Zoom in.

43:17.553 --> 43:18.887
Hold on, I'll sharpen it.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.391
How could you be sure
they aren't on the right track?

43:22.391 --> 43:25.227
Because my operatives
already spoke to the woman in question.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.187
She gave up what little info she had.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.272
Sutherland and the girl

43:28.272 --> 43:30.232
are not close enough
for us to be worried yet.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.526
And what happened to her? The woman.

43:33.485 --> 43:35.696
[man] <i>Probably best not to say.</i>

43:35.696 --> 43:36.947
[sighing] Jesus.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.242
- You wanted loose ends tied up.
<i>-</i> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.870
When is this all gonna be over?

43:42.870 --> 43:44.038
Soon.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.916
- Okay, what am I looking for?
- Shit.

43:47.916 --> 43:48.834
[Rose] What?

43:50.002 --> 43:51.295
She's Secret Service.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.755
How could you be so sure?

43:52.755 --> 43:54.340
'Cause I know her.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.178
[suspenseful music swelling]

44:05.267 --> 44:06.935
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

44:08.270 --> 44:10.439
- Good morning. She in there? I got this.
- [Chelsea] Yes.

44:12.149 --> 44:15.944
Okay, if she's Secret Service,
then that means--

44:15.944 --> 44:17.946
She's on somebody's protection detail.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.949
Rose, this isn't
a terrorist attack anymore,

44:20.949 --> 44:22.826
this is an assassination attempt.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.495
On who?

44:25.704 --> 44:26.914
[Redfield] Hey, sweetie.

44:27.956 --> 44:29.208
Already with the look.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.460
[Maddie] We both know why you're here,
so get on with it.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.463
- I went to a bar, a guy talked to me.
- [Redfield] Maddie--

44:34.463 --> 44:37.508
[Redfield] Why do you have to go
out of your way to have problems?

44:37.508 --> 44:40.678
[Maddie] How is going to a bar
going out of my way to have problems?

44:40.678 --> 44:43.514
[Redfield] You don't need to go to a bar!
Why don't you try studying?

44:43.514 --> 44:44.848
[music fades]

44:46.934 --> 44:48.602
[ending theme music playing]
