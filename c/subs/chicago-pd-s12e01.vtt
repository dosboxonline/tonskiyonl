into this time, Hank?

00:24.791 --> 00:26.593
- I'm okay to go out like this.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.705
- To start over, I guess.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.240
- To leave?

00:40.273 --> 00:42.475
- I don't want
to leave the team.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.378

01:12.339 --> 01:13.740
We have a false alarm.

01:13.773 --> 01:14.874

01:14.908 --> 01:16.676
- 2120 Fullerton.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.378

- Oh.
- Mm.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.810
We never really gave you a real
welcome to the unit, did we?

04:36.843 --> 04:38.478
- [scoffs]
It's been over a month,

04:38.511 --> 04:39.946
and you want to throw
me a party now?

04:39.979 --> 04:41.414
What's this for,
the Bailey case?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.683
- Mm-hmm. Just background.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.486
- This is my new system.
I'm alphabetizing.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.722
That's how many cases
we owe paperwork on.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.023

- Yeah, well, I've
alphabetized the alphabetized.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.360

like this, Telly.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.527
Trust me.

- Yes, the man almost died.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.997
That's what Ruzey
told me, at least.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.000
- Don't call me that, Emily.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.534
That started in the academy.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.969
Don't do it here.
This a safe space.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.070
- Where you coming from, Ruzey?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.139
- See?
Now you see what you did?

05:06.172 --> 05:07.907
I was talking with Kim
on the phone.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.109
- Let's put a bell on him.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.577
- What'd she tell you
about NAWLEE?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.479
- She said the conference
is good, learning a lot.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.981
She's, uh, disturbed
by her caseload.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.950
So she's thinking about
coming back early.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.051
- Well, she shouldn't.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.153
CPD loves stuff like NAWLEE.
It'll give her a leg up.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.788

05:21.821 --> 05:23.456

on all charges.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.992
- All right,
get all the paper done.

or a Narcotics detail?

05:35.835 --> 05:37.070
- Narcotics.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.471

I'm just trying to get away.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.716
There's a guy inside.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.184
He's--he's killing everybody.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.052

still in the building?

07:11.664 --> 07:13.266

and he ran off.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.234
I don't know who else

08:59.339 --> 09:01.207
One-man lick crew.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.344
Place is a trap house,
selling dope and sex in here.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.079
- CPD have an index?

09:06.112 --> 09:07.347
- Uh, not yet.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.050
But G-Parks run the territory.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.117
- I got the bodies' ID'd.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.986
The two with their hands tied
behind their backs

09:13.019 --> 09:14.788
are Clay Montrose
and Javon Wilkens.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.790
- Well, they gotta be dealers.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.625
I mean, pockets turned
inside out,

09:18.658 --> 09:19.793
stash and cash ripped.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.161
- I mean, that tracks.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.762
Both have priors for possession
with intent to sell,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.064
but no gang cards
on either of them.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.632
- Okay.
What about the other guy?

09:25.665 --> 09:27.100
- Uh, Walter Tells.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.902
He's got one prior for
possession, but also two rehabs

09:28.935 --> 09:30.904
under his belt, so I'm
guessing he relapsed today.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.139
- Yeah, and was beat to death
with a lock in sock.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.841
- That confirmed?

09:34.874 --> 09:38.144
- Well, padlock's inside,
sock was down Walter's throat.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.246
All right, let's bag it
ourselves, huh?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.015
- Hey, Sarge.
Might have something over here.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.350
Can you tell them
what you told me?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.718
- Can you please
just uncuff me?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.120
- Mm-mm. Tell them.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.322
- I mean, I saw the guy--
I heard the guy come in.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.990
He was, uh, shouting a lot.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.992
He--he went straight
for the dealers, though.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.994
He--he--he tied them up
and he beat them.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.996
- Okay.
And the other man, Walter?

09:57.030 --> 09:58.264
- Is that the guy
in the button-down?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.733
- That's right.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.867
- Um, well,
he tried to stop him.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.935
That didn't really work.
- Okay.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.136
Did you know the offender?

10:03.169 --> 10:04.671
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.373
Uh, he--he was, um--
he was Black.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.741
He was in his 30s.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.109
He--uh, maybe he was, um--

10:09.142 --> 10:11.077
- Hey, hey.
Is there anything else?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.345
Got anything else?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.014
- Uh, he was, like,
tall, maybe.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.181
- Uh-huh.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.683
- Okay, look, I don't know.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.018
I ran, and I never
pick up around here.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.719
I don't really know
anybody around here.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.689
Um, if you could just uncuff
me, then I would be able to--

10:22.722 --> 10:24.157
- Well, bring her in.
I want a sketch.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.793
- No. No, no, no, no.
Come on, please.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.096
- So call Narcotics?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.798
This is their wheelhouse.
- No, no, no.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.299
I want this.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.102
- Boss, we got half a dozen
cases that still owe paperwork.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.071
- No, it's ours.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.873
Look, there are
three dead bodies.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.975
We'll work it faster.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.309
- I heard the deputy chief.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.812
He's looking into each unit,
going to their scenes.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.814
Buttoning up our caseload
might be our best bet

10:47.847 --> 10:49.049
if we want to fly under
this man's radar.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.750
- Adam, you got your answer.
It's ours.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.185
So go help out with forensics.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.820
- All right.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.024
- Do I look beat up to you?
- No, sir. It's--

10:58.058 --> 10:59.325
- No, no, no.
See, you just want--

10:59.359 --> 11:00.393
- You know him?
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.062
He's a frequent flyer.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.897
We bring him in at least
once a month for prostitution

11:03.930 --> 11:05.198
or possession.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.100
He calls himself Rabbit because
he hops from carrot to carrot.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.802
- He was in there
turning a trick?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.036
- That's what he says.
- Huh.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.404
- Claims he was
waiting for a john

11:11.438 --> 11:12.472
upstairs that never showed.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.873
Didn't see anything.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.275
- All right, copy that.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.043
Hey, come on.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.478
I'll give you a ride home.
- No, I'm good.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.479
I know how to get home.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.980
- I was being polite.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.015
Let's go.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.516
All right, you got two options.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.085
You can come with me,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.820
or the paramedics
take you to Med,

11:26.853 --> 11:28.788
get you cleared,
then take you to the district.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.256
That option will take
about five hours.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.859
You think you can wait
that long to get well?

11:34.361 --> 11:35.428
Let's go.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.463
- Let me get my stuff.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.864
Where's my stuff?
You got my stuff?

11:53.179 --> 11:55.815
- Look, man, I already told
all your police what happened,

11:55.849 --> 11:58.118
and I didn't see anything.
- Mm.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.053
- Look, I was upstairs,
and, you know,

12:00.086 --> 12:02.956
I heard a bunch of yelling,
you know, shouting.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.358
You know, guys getting beat.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.926
So I ran down and I look.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.528
I found them guys
messed up like that.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.131
- Hm.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.035
- And I tried to help, okay?
You know this.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.571
- Yeah, well, you had
real good timing.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.173
- What?

12:20.206 --> 12:21.875
Man, whatever.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.109
- That's your place
right here, isn't it?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.411
- Nah, man.
Just pull over, bro.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.812
- Should I park out front?

12:25.845 --> 12:26.946
- Look, I already
told you what I saw.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.214
- Did you?
- Come on.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.251
See, I'm done messing with you.
Yo, just take me round back.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.589
- So you came downstairs.
The offender was already gone.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.258
- Yo, isn't that
what I just said?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.960
- And I am telling you,
that is very good timing.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.065
But the offender knew
that trap house,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.367
knew exactly where
to find those dealers,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.203
went right to them,
had their dope real quick.

12:50.236 --> 12:53.206
That makes me think offender
knew the neighborhood,

12:53.239 --> 12:55.141
neighborhood knew the offender.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.409
- Okay.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.577
- Now, did you see him?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.446
Do you know him?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.014
- No.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.284
Hey.
Yo, yo.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.318
Hey, what the hell, man?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.353
This how you do your job?

13:06.386 --> 13:07.454
Okay, go find some evidence.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.456
- I will, but this is faster.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.957
- Let me out, man.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.859
[tires screech]

13:19.899 --> 13:22.602
- You know what happens when
you see death that close up,

13:22.635 --> 13:26.072
like we just did?

13:26.106 --> 13:28.141
You separate yourself from it.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.211
[soft dramatic music]

13:31.244 --> 13:33.380
Don't.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.616
* *

13:36.649 --> 13:38.952
Remember what that man
looked like--

13:38.985 --> 13:41.621
choking, scared,
knowing he was dying.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.889
Remember that.

13:42.922 --> 13:46.026
- [mumbles]

13:46.059 --> 13:48.361
- And tell me who killed him.

13:48.395 --> 13:55.335
* *

14:03.476 --> 14:04.010
.

14:04.044 --> 14:04.978
- All right, listen up.
EJ Monroe, 30 years old.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.448
According to his arrest,
he was hooked in

14:08.481 --> 14:11.151
with a G-Park Lord set run
by Troy Patrick.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.987
But EJ started using
his own product,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.622
so Patrick ran him off.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.258
Now EJ is a hype
who's on the outs,

14:18.291 --> 14:19.993
and apparently he just
ripped and killed

14:20.026 --> 14:21.461
Patrick's new dealers.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.129
EJ is our offender.

14:23.163 --> 14:26.166
- Boss, how'd you
get this guy's name?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.368
- It fits our witness at
the scene's description.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.204
Also fits our theory
of an inside job.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.973
We got motive.
It's good.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.408
- We know where EJ is at?

14:35.442 --> 14:36.476
- No.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.412
EJ's last known was
torn down three months ago.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.613
We don't have a current.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.248
So dig into him.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.983
I'll hit contacts
out on the street.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.352
Let's find out where he is.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.554
- You don't want us
to firm up that ID?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.956
- Just put EJ's photo in front
of our hype from the scene.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.458
- She's dopesick.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.660
She's gonna need to get well
before she can make a good ID.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.694
- I don't care. Try.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.162
Just keep moving.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.198
Be ready to hit either way.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.400
You get me my
arrest warrant on EJ?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.702
- No. How exactly did
you expect me to?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.337
This is paper-thin.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.039
Who ID'd EJ?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.440
- Confidential source.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.209
- Okay, well, you're gonna
need more than that.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.044
With a case this weak,
you're gonna need to give

15:11.077 --> 15:13.113
your source's name to a judge.
- No.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.447
- Okay, fine.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.183
Then get more evidence--
forensics, DNA.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.685
Put EJ at the scene.
Get a witness statement.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.186
- That'll take too long.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.721
I'll just do
a sneak-and-peek instead.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.423
- What, and hope
for something actionable?

15:23.456 --> 15:26.326
Hey, how long are
we gonna do this?

15:26.359 --> 15:27.394
- Do what?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.194
- This.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.430
You burning through cases,
running.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.332
Me pretending that
this is normal and okay,

15:32.365 --> 15:33.767
that this clearly
isn't a reaction

15:33.800 --> 15:35.201
to what happened to you.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.703
- Sarge, we got EJ.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.438
According to socials, he's
been crashing at his cousin's.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.573
- All right, let's go!

15:44.244 --> 15:46.246
Ruzek, you and me first.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.214
Rest of you, hold anchor.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.183
- Copy that, boss.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.153
[soft dramatic music]

15:53.186 --> 16:00.293
* *

16:02.829 --> 16:04.130
- I'll take the front.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.032
You go around back.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.267
Stay low.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.769
Just find something actionable.

16:09.803 --> 16:17.143
* *

16:28.822 --> 16:36.129
* *

16:43.403 --> 16:46.172
It looks like he
is packing to run.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.542
We can wait him out,
or we can fish.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.781
- Damn it.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.449
Boss, I got a camera back here.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.651
Chances are he's watching us.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.091
- He's running!
He's going out front!

17:05.125 --> 17:06.693
- Hey! Chicago PD!

17:06.726 --> 17:08.061
Stop!

17:08.728 --> 17:09.863
EJ!

17:09.896 --> 17:12.832
[suspenseful music]

17:12.866 --> 17:14.434
5021-Ocean.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.835
I got an armed offender
heading northbound on Jackson.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.303
- All right, we're going in.
Let's go.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.672
- We don't have a warrant!
- We're going in!

17:18.705 --> 17:19.806
We'll claim exigent.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.107
- Come on.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.677
- Chicago PD!

17:23.710 --> 17:26.079
Chicago PD!

17:27.213 --> 17:29.249
- Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

17:39.559 --> 17:40.894
- Clear!

17:40.927 --> 17:42.595
- I'm clear.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.564
- I got blood.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.100
Looks like he was about
to burn the evidence.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.869
- I got his shoes
in the front room.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.771
Trace amounts
of blood on them.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.213
I've lost eyes
on our offender.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.581
Armed male, Black.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.516
White T-shirt,
black sweatpants, 6 foot.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.652
Last seen running
eastbound on Jackson.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.488
I repeat, I lost eyes.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.524
- Copy, 5021-Ocean.
We'll notify.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.293
- What the--

18:19.933 --> 18:22.268
Yeah, that's residue.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.672
He flushed the drugs.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.244
This is China white heroin.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.881
That's got to be
at least 20K.

18:34.914 --> 18:42.222
* *

18:42.956 --> 18:44.858
- What is it?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.926
- The address
of the trap house.

18:46.960 --> 18:52.198
* *

18:56.870 --> 18:57.370
.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.471
- We completely lost EJ.
I got patrol hitting every yard

18:59.339 --> 19:00.807
and every alley
in a 10-block radius.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.308
- He can't have gotten far.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.210
He left his phone,
keys, and wallet inside.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.779
- Get a transit team
on the CTA.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.981
- I already called it in,
and I got his vehicle

19:08.014 --> 19:09.683
getting hooked and towed to 21.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.751
Phone dumped, so we'll get
the evidence we need.

19:11.785 --> 19:14.721
But why the hell would
he flush the drugs?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.656
- Hold on.
He flushed the product?

19:16.690 --> 19:17.791
- The whole China white.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.892
And it matched what he ripped.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.493
Flushed it all down the toilet.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.495
- So what, he saw us coming?
He got scared?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.564
- That's a hell of a lot
of money to flush out of fear.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.266
I mean, you killed
three people for it,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.301
then you flush it
straight down the toilet?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.903
Doesn't track.
- No, it doesn't.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.439
So work the scene,
keep up the search, find EJ.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.441
I got something
to do on my own.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.377
- [scoffs] I finally got
a job back on a unit.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.579
I'm not touching any of that.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.716
- Hey, boss.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.652
You need backup?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.886
- Just find EJ.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.764
[lock rattles, clicks]

21:42.002 --> 21:44.337
[keys clatter]

21:47.140 --> 21:49.009
You lied to me.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.110
- What? No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.544
What are you doing here?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.380
- You lied to me.
Why did you lie?

21:53.413 --> 21:54.414
- I didn't lie.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.749
- You were in on the rip.

21:55.782 --> 21:56.916
- What? No.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.585
- You gave EJ the address.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.953
You wrote it on a bag of candy.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.155
- [stammers] Well, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.757
It's not what it looks like.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.825
- You were so dumb to think
that I wouldn't find out?

22:05.859 --> 22:07.627
- Dumb? Look, it's not
what it looks like.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.729
- Is that your cut?
- What? No.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.131
- You better start
learning some words

22:11.164 --> 22:12.766
other than "no" real fast.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.733
- Okay, look, man,

22:13.767 --> 22:15.635
I didn't know what EJ
was gonna do, okay?

22:15.669 --> 22:17.737
I had no idea that he was
gonna kill someone.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.072
- Come on, let's go.
You're going in for murder.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.573
- No, no!
Just listen to me!

22:20.607 --> 22:23.076
Why would I have stayed

22:23.109 --> 22:26.479
if I knew that he was gonna
kill someone, huh?

22:26.513 --> 22:27.814
Okay, that's why.
I didn't know.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.749
EJ asked me where
the dealers would be,

22:29.783 --> 22:32.419
so, look, I gave him
the address, okay?

22:32.452 --> 22:33.920
That's all.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.889
Okay, I swear to you,
I'm not lying, okay?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.757
I didn't know anything.
- Two options--

22:37.791 --> 22:38.858
- Oh, come on.
I'm not messing with you.

22:38.892 --> 22:41.027
- I arrest you, plus I add
all your little goodies

22:41.061 --> 22:42.629
here to the charges.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.865
Or you come in
right now willingly

22:45.899 --> 22:49.636
and cooperate fully,
and I don't play with you.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.972
What's it gonna be?

22:53.006 --> 22:54.941
- Look, man, I'm really
starting to think

22:54.974 --> 22:56.943
you like spending time with me,
because I already told you,

22:56.976 --> 22:59.212
I gave him the address because
it was the right thing.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.215
- Okay, you keep saying that.
What the hell does that mean?

23:02.248 --> 23:03.917
- Oh, come on, you're the one
who just lectured me on death,

23:03.950 --> 23:04.984
so figure it out.

23:05.018 --> 23:06.986
- Fully cooperate!

23:07.020 --> 23:09.522
- [laughs] You know--you know,
it's a real rich thing

23:09.556 --> 23:11.491
to lecture an addict on.
- Please.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.760
- You know, because
we live with death.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.229
- [sighs]
- EJ lives with death.

23:16.262 --> 23:20.066
- Will you get to the point?

23:20.100 --> 23:22.202
- Okay. Yeah.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.739
Let me educate you,
Mr. CPD Officer.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.574
- Okay.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.643
- I gave EJ the address
because EJ wanted

23:30.677 --> 23:34.848
to know who was responsible
for his sister dying.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.783
- What?
- That's right.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.551
So you want to talk
about death,

23:38.585 --> 23:41.688
you should be talking
about that.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.056
- Okay, who killed his sister?

23:43.089 --> 23:46.526
- Oh, who do you think?

23:46.559 --> 23:48.995
Troy Patrick's drugs
killed her.

23:49.029 --> 23:52.165
Yeah, he has his guys cutting
their dope with battery acid.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.234
Like, what the--

23:54.267 --> 23:56.069
he wanted a cheaper cut.

23:56.102 --> 24:00.106
Wasn't good at it,
but he sold it anyway.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.110
- So that's why he killed those
dealers, took their stash?

24:04.144 --> 24:05.712
- They're selling poison.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.982
- Please, just answer
the question.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.583
Please.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.120
- Yes.

24:14.154 --> 24:16.523
That's why EJ killed them
and took their stash,

24:16.556 --> 24:18.258
to destroy it.

24:18.291 --> 24:22.128
That's why I gave him
the address.

24:22.162 --> 24:25.098
[phone buzzing]

24:26.700 --> 24:29.135
I mean, all deaths
should mean something.

24:29.169 --> 24:31.137
- Hang on. Yeah.

24:31.171 --> 24:32.605
- [muttering]

24:32.639 --> 24:35.642
- Hey, boss,
we got a good lead.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.611
Patrol spotted EJ running
into an old auto shop.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.913
They lost eyes,
but we're getting

24:39.946 --> 24:41.681
suited up to crash,
so we'll hit him in--

24:43.249 --> 24:46.820
And he just looked right at me.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.154
Son of a--

24:48.188 --> 24:50.623
Chicago PD! Stop!

24:50.657 --> 24:52.959
[dramatic music]

24:52.992 --> 24:54.194
- 5021-Sam.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.029
Officers in pursuit
of suspect, armed.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.599
Headed towards alley
behind the auto shop.

24:59.632 --> 25:03.169
- Get off the fence!
Off the fence!

25:03.203 --> 25:05.972
[grunting]

25:08.341 --> 25:11.011
[panting]

25:11.044 --> 25:17.984
* *

25:21.221 --> 25:23.089
- [inhales sharply]

25:28.795 --> 25:30.964
- Chicago PD!
Drop it!

25:34.000 --> 25:35.301
Drop your weapon!

25:35.335 --> 25:37.203
- Drop it!
Drop it!

25:37.237 --> 25:38.872
Drop your weapon now!

25:41.374 --> 25:42.342
- [grunts]

25:42.375 --> 25:43.677
- On the ground.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.645
Hands behind your back
right now.

25:45.679 --> 25:46.713
Give me cuffs.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.081
Someone give me cuffs!

25:48.114 --> 25:50.250
[panting]

25:50.283 --> 25:52.719
* *

26:05.699 --> 26:05.865
.

26:05.899 --> 26:06.399
- You sure you're good?

26:07.267 --> 26:08.835
- Yeah, sure.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.670
It's not the first time
I faced down a barrel.

26:10.704 --> 26:12.405
Just happened fast.

26:12.439 --> 26:14.274
How about you?
Are you okay?

26:14.307 --> 26:15.909
All right, I'm just asking.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.644
It's a big jump,
you joining this team

26:17.677 --> 26:18.945
after, you know, what happened.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.047
Now this.
- What happened?

26:21.081 --> 26:23.149
What, you tiptoeing
around me now?

26:25.251 --> 26:26.853
Yes, Ruzey.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.822
It was a big jump
to join this team

26:28.855 --> 26:31.725
after I lost my marbles
when my partner was shot dead.

26:31.758 --> 26:32.859
- How eloquent.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.728
- Yeah, but my head
is good now.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.764
I've got a full bill
of that mental sanity.

26:37.797 --> 26:41.167
And your sorry ass didn't
get shot, so we're good.

26:41.201 --> 26:42.702
- Come on. Out the car.

26:48.475 --> 26:51.745
- Hey, Adam, come on in here.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.747
Martel, just bring him up.
Put him on ice.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.982
- Move.
- All right. Case expanded.

26:56.016 --> 26:57.817
It got bigger.
I want both now.

26:57.851 --> 26:59.019
- Both?
- Yeah.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.321
We got a string of ODs
from a hot batch.

27:01.354 --> 27:02.756
It's still young.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.891
Looks like it was EJ's motive.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.993
Just call Narcotics,
fill them in.

27:07.027 --> 27:09.829
Get everything they have
on Troy Patrick.

27:13.233 --> 27:14.868
- [sighs]

27:27.247 --> 27:29.215
- Your sister?

27:31.317 --> 27:33.920
I'm sorry for your loss.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.191
I'll make it easy for you.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.326
I know all three of them were
killed from a bad batch

27:40.360 --> 27:43.229
of dope cut with battery acid.

27:43.263 --> 27:46.232
I'm right?

27:46.266 --> 27:48.301
- Do you want me
to do your job for you?

27:48.335 --> 27:51.338
- Hmm.

27:51.371 --> 27:54.374
It was this man's dope?

27:54.407 --> 27:57.377
The news of the bad batch
hadn't reached CPD yet,

27:57.410 --> 28:00.113
but it did reach the street.

28:00.146 --> 28:04.984
So you killed the dealers,
took the stash, and flushed it.

28:07.387 --> 28:08.521
You know what?

28:08.555 --> 28:11.024
[chuckles] I get it.

28:12.826 --> 28:15.895
The problem is,
the law does not get it.

28:15.929 --> 28:19.232
Law is not eye for an eye,
death for a death.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.367
- Well, it should be.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.335
- Oh, really?

28:22.369 --> 28:26.506
What about the third man
you killed, Walter Tells?

28:26.539 --> 28:29.442
Hell, he was just there
to get high.

28:29.476 --> 28:31.211
You think the law
should understand

28:31.244 --> 28:34.114
why you killed him, too?

28:34.147 --> 28:35.849
Huh?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.951
What's it gonna be?

28:37.984 --> 28:39.519
- What's he doing here?

28:39.552 --> 28:41.121
- We have no idea.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.890
- He hasn't been
officially booked.

28:45.392 --> 28:46.993
- I'm not asking for remorse.

28:47.027 --> 28:49.062
I'm asking for action.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.464
- Well, I'm not
gonna talk to you.

28:51.498 --> 28:53.266
- Well, you should.

28:53.299 --> 28:57.337
Because I can give you
what you actually want.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.841
Justice.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.910
Not just a couple
of low-level dealers

29:03.943 --> 29:06.813
slinging dime bags
that you beat to death.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.117
Real justice.

29:11.151 --> 29:15.255
Troy Patrick in prison
for life,

29:15.288 --> 29:17.924
all his men in cuffs,

29:17.957 --> 29:21.428
and all that bad dope--
hell,

29:21.461 --> 29:25.165
all the bad dope he is bound
to make in his sorry-ass life,

29:25.198 --> 29:28.001
all of that off the street
for good.

29:28.034 --> 29:32.005
[tense music]

29:32.038 --> 29:36.409
EJ, you're going to prison
for life either way.

29:38.345 --> 29:42.215
Why not make the lives
you gave him worth something?

29:42.248 --> 29:47.220
* *

29:47.253 --> 29:50.623
According to EJ, Troy Patrick
runs a two-block territory

29:50.657 --> 29:53.059
between Ogden and 19th.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.428
Got six packmen
slinging dope for him.

29:55.462 --> 29:56.429
- They're all low level,

29:56.463 --> 29:58.998
work out of trap houses
or work the corners.

29:59.032 --> 30:00.633
- Problem is, Patrick's cutting
his own product

30:00.667 --> 30:02.435
to keep costs low,
but he's making bad dope.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.537
We got at least three ODs
linked to this man right now.

30:04.571 --> 30:06.072
- Okay.

30:06.106 --> 30:08.008
So have Gangs or Narcotics
backed any of this up?

30:08.041 --> 30:10.543
The buys, the hierarchy?

30:10.577 --> 30:12.345
- No.
No, I looped them in.

30:12.379 --> 30:14.381
They got next to nothing
on Troy Patrick.

30:14.414 --> 30:16.149
- Because it's brand new.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.317
- Right.

30:17.350 --> 30:20.887
So everything you have is
all based on EJ's word alone?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.589
- Yep.

30:22.622 --> 30:25.892
- The word of a man who just
committed a triple homicide?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.260
- That's right.

30:28.528 --> 30:30.997
- You know no judge is gonna
let you arrest on this.

30:31.031 --> 30:33.566
You know that.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.335
I mean, this is ridiculous.

30:35.368 --> 30:37.470
You can't just fly solo
and expect that things are

30:37.504 --> 30:40.440
gonna be clean and easy, that
I'm gonna hand you warrants.

30:40.473 --> 30:42.108
You have to build.

30:42.142 --> 30:43.977
- Right, and how many more
people are gonna die

30:44.010 --> 30:46.913
from this dope while
we do that, hmm?

30:46.946 --> 30:48.982
Seriously,
what's the equation here?

30:49.015 --> 30:50.350
What are we okay with?

30:50.383 --> 30:53.153
Three, maybe four ODs?

30:53.186 --> 30:55.922
Because that's what you're
arguing for--more ODs.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.390
- Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

30:57.424 --> 30:59.693
- It's a hot batch.
People are dying.

30:59.726 --> 31:02.228
We get it off the street now.

31:16.643 --> 31:19.646
- You think this
is gonna work?

31:19.679 --> 31:22.015
- I don't know.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.718
Zero prep time,
zero plan B.

31:24.751 --> 31:26.453
Let's hope it does.

31:26.486 --> 31:30.323
- [muttering indistinctly]

31:39.399 --> 31:41.067
[knocks on door]

31:43.003 --> 31:45.205
Y'all ready?
[clears throat]

31:45.238 --> 31:47.607
Yo, what's up?
- The hell are you doing here?

31:47.640 --> 31:48.742
- I'm here for you.

31:48.775 --> 31:50.443
I want to holler at you.

31:50.477 --> 31:53.013
- About what?

31:53.046 --> 31:54.214
- Man, let's go inside.

31:54.247 --> 31:57.450
It's better inside.
[chuckles]

31:57.484 --> 32:00.453
[tense music]

32:00.487 --> 32:02.455
* *

32:02.489 --> 32:04.524
I'll only take two minutes.
I'll be real quick.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.130
Yeah, bro.

32:10.163 --> 32:12.365
- What do you want?

32:12.399 --> 32:13.733
Talk.

32:13.767 --> 32:16.703
- Uh...
[mumbles]

32:16.736 --> 32:18.405
I want to buy from you.
- Whoa.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.341
Sarge, we got guns,
at least two of them.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.243
- Right now.
- All right, copy.

32:23.276 --> 32:25.712
- I-I'll pay you over, but--
but I want it from you.

32:25.745 --> 32:27.347
And I don't want none of that

32:27.380 --> 32:29.549
stepped-on, battery acid-cut

32:29.582 --> 32:32.052
kitty litter-tasting ass
you've been selling.

32:32.085 --> 32:35.155
- What?
You came here to buy from me?

32:35.188 --> 32:37.424
- I'm talking clear, aren't I?
- Yeah.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.526
That's not how it works.
Get out.

32:39.559 --> 32:40.427
- Hey, come on, yo.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.329
I've been giving you
all my business.

32:43.363 --> 32:45.632
- You think I have dope on me?

32:45.665 --> 32:47.567
You think I'm holding?

32:47.600 --> 32:49.135
- What? Yes.

32:49.169 --> 32:51.237
Ain't no idiot.
I'm a hype, bro.

32:51.271 --> 32:53.106
Look, you got dope on you,
and I just--

32:53.139 --> 32:54.174
I just want to buy
the good stuff.

32:54.207 --> 32:55.108
I ain't messing
with your corners.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.543
- Get out.

32:56.576 --> 32:57.777
- Hey, you really want me
going somewhere else?

32:57.811 --> 32:59.346
I'm your best customer.

32:59.379 --> 33:01.047
- Yo, Sarge, how we feeling?

33:01.081 --> 33:02.148
- We both know that, so--

33:02.182 --> 33:03.383
- He's fine.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.684
- Do you really
want me bringing

33:04.718 --> 33:07.654
my hard-earned cash elsewhere?

33:07.687 --> 33:09.489
Because I'll bring
my cash elsewhere,

33:09.522 --> 33:11.224
and I'll buy
from another prick

33:11.257 --> 33:12.392
who ain't selling bad product,
trying to--

33:12.425 --> 33:14.127
- Shut up!
The bad batch is gone.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.495
It didn't work!

33:15.528 --> 33:17.464
- All right, that's enough.
We'll take it. Move!

33:17.497 --> 33:18.832
- Let's go.

33:18.865 --> 33:20.533
- Get the hell
out of my house!

33:20.567 --> 33:22.035
- Come on.

33:23.303 --> 33:24.437
- Well, I'm not
gonna buy from--

33:24.471 --> 33:25.405
- Get out!

33:25.438 --> 33:26.573
- It's gotta be from you!

33:26.606 --> 33:28.141
- What the hell
are you talking about?

33:28.174 --> 33:29.476
You setting me up?

33:51.564 --> 33:52.699
Don't you move!
- Turn around!

33:52.732 --> 33:54.467
- Hey, I got you.

33:54.501 --> 33:55.835
I got you.
It's all right.

[groans]
- Yeah, yeah.

34:11.651 --> 34:13.720
Hey, hey, we're good.
- I didn't get enough.

34:13.753 --> 34:15.422
- We're good. It's enough.

34:15.455 --> 34:16.790
All right. Hey.
- I didn't answer--

34:16.823 --> 34:17.857
I tried to--

34:17.891 --> 34:19.459
- Hey, stop talking.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.127
Just look at me.

34:21.161 --> 34:22.662
Keep your eyes on me.

come over the radio.

36:09.369 --> 36:10.870
Three G-Parks apprehended.

36:10.904 --> 36:12.872
- Yes, sir.
- Nice work.

36:12.906 --> 36:13.973
Hey, I'm not here
to slow you down.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.309
I just figured I'd meet
your team while in action.

36:16.343 --> 36:17.610
You keep doing your thing.

36:17.644 --> 36:19.746

Good work.

I got nothing
to hand off to you.

Everything's quiet,
so be grateful.

36:57.951 --> 36:59.619
Still at 4820 Ada?

36:59.652 --> 37:01.755
- Yeah, still with the victim
at 4820 Ada.

37:01.788 --> 37:04.524
The dog was last seen
westbound on 48th Street.

37:05.759 --> 37:08.294

No occupants.

Nothing further.

37:09.796 --> 37:11.564
- 10-4.

- How do you know about Rabbit?

37:37.457 --> 37:39.659
- Platt.
Went out over the radio.

37:39.693 --> 37:40.894
- Right.

He's fine.

37:43.563 --> 37:45.398
I mean, he got to Med.

37:45.432 --> 37:47.701
Stable for now.
He'll pull through.

37:47.734 --> 37:49.536
- That's good.

37:50.804 --> 37:54.407
We're gonna have
a conversation now.

37:54.441 --> 37:57.610
- That sounds like
a real fun start to one.

37:57.644 --> 37:59.346
- Mm.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.381
I'm guessing Upton
used to do this.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.083
- Do what, exactly?

38:03.116 --> 38:04.651
- Confront you.

38:04.684 --> 38:05.952

with the running, okay?

38:14.627 --> 38:16.696
I'm not gonna do it
anymore with you,

38:16.730 --> 38:20.400
and your team shouldn't be
doing it anymore either.

38:21.568 --> 38:24.371
I get it. Upton's gone.

38:24.404 --> 38:25.972
You almost died
in that basement.

38:26.006 --> 38:29.542
I mean, that must have
triggered something.

38:29.576 --> 38:33.380
But whatever this is,
an attempt to outrun death--

38:33.413 --> 38:34.748
- You think I'm trying
to outrun death?

38:34.781 --> 38:36.716

38:36.750 --> 38:40.954
- I'm not trying
to outrun death, okay?

38:40.987 --> 38:43.690
Look, I would have been fine
to die in that basement.

38:43.723 --> 38:45.725
- Really?

38:45.759 --> 38:48.094
Okay. Then what are you
trying to do now?

38:48.128 --> 38:50.463
- I'm working.

38:50.497 --> 38:51.865
- You're not working.

38:51.898 --> 38:54.501
This isn't just work.
This is gonna burn you out.

38:54.534 --> 38:56.403
- Then let it.

38:58.038 --> 39:02.642
Look, I didn't die.

39:02.676 --> 39:06.546

I saw my old partner.

39:28.802 --> 39:32.772
I mean, I saw him like
he was right there.

39:36.776 --> 39:40.680
He said I don't get to die yet.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.982
Told me there was more.

39:45.251 --> 39:47.854
- More?

39:47.887 --> 39:51.191
- I'm still here.

39:51.224 --> 39:53.927
I should use the time.

Hey, uh, make sure
that all gets filed

40:03.636 --> 40:04.871
back to Intelligence, yeah?

40:04.904 --> 40:06.940

40:19.119 --> 40:20.653

40:20.687 --> 40:23.223
- How long before Voight
picks up another scene?

40:23.256 --> 40:25.592
I'll put 20 on three hours.

40:25.625 --> 40:28.928
- Yeah, I'll take the over.
Get some sleep.

40:32.665 --> 40:34.601
- I'm starting to
get used to it now.

40:34.634 --> 40:36.636
There's something
about the pace.

40:36.670 --> 40:38.571
There's a--
there's a buzz to it.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.040
- Yeah, a buzz of anxiety.

40:40.073 --> 40:41.708
- No, adrenaline.

40:41.741 --> 40:43.176
You can't be scared.

You just--you got to go.
You got to move.

Thank you for, uh,
pulling me up.

I was beginning to think I'd
never be in the field again.

40:52.986 --> 40:54.721

You deserve it.
