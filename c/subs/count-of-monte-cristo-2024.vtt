01:02.100 --> 01:04.500
1815 Napoleon, removed from
power took refuge on the island of

01:04.500 --> 01:07.000
Elba. While his supporters
dream of his return,

01:07.000 --> 01:09.400
the new royal power pursues
them mercilessly. During the

01:09.400 --> 01:11.600
civil war, the number of arrests
and executions increases.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.400
On a stormy night off the coast
of Cape Corso (Corsica), the ship

01:17.420 --> 01:19.820
Pharaoh merchant crosses the path
and finds wreckage of another ship...

02:47.040 --> 02:48.000
You saved her.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.870
Pass me a blanket!

02:57.410 --> 02:58.830
I forbade him to go there!

02:59.250 --> 03:02.830
Go down to the basement! I
don't want to see you until Marseille!

03:03.750 --> 03:04.580
What?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.620
Do you think I'm brutal?

03:07.370 --> 03:10.330
Not only do I know
that, but I brag about it.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.040
Let's go!

03:15.700 --> 03:17.750
Let's go, everyone,
to your posts!

03:20.250 --> 03:22.620
Place it in a dry place
before it freezes to death.

03:22.790 --> 03:23.790
Wait!

03:26.910 --> 03:27.910
Let's go!

03:41.100 --> 03:43.100
Napoleon's message

04:06.080 --> 04:07.200
Did you sleep well?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.410
You have something
that belongs to me.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.620
I had never seen
the Emperor's writing.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.160
Give me this letter back.

04:18.579 --> 04:19.870
I don't think so, no.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.750
What do you want?

04:23.750 --> 04:25.870
A good reason not to report her.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.500
Try silver.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.330
It often works.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.580
I don't have any.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.620
But I have friends.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.830
If you are talking
about this letter,

04:40.410 --> 04:42.950
they will find you
and they will kill you,

04:44.250 --> 04:45.830
Captain Danglars.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.700
Sir?

05:25.370 --> 05:27.500
I caused you a lot of trouble.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.330
I don't know how to thank you.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.910
Just did this.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.750
Take care.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.500
Miss...?

05:41.290 --> 05:42.290
Angele.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.830
Edmond.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.080
I will never forget
your courage.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.790
But forget my name.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.500
Goodbye, Edmond.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.250
Goodbye, Angele.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.910
Morrel wants to see him.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.870
We had just changed shift,
off the coast of Cape Corso.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.910
The waves were strong. We
were 200 fathoms from the wreck.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.700
Give me the logbook.

06:24.700 --> 06:28.910
We were hitting the rubble when Dantès
wanted to leave with the rowing boat

06:29.080 --> 06:31.540
I banned it. It was crazy.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.000
- And truth?
 - Yes sir.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.540
- We would have done it for one of our men.
 - It was my decision.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.830
- I assumed my responsibilities.
 - I ordered

06:40.000 --> 06:41.660
we would have to turn
around and he dived.

06:42.410 --> 06:43.450
Did you dive?

06:43.830 --> 06:46.410
The captain had
not prohibited diving.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.700
That's enough.

06:48.370 --> 06:49.830
Have you seen this insolence?

06:51.450 --> 06:55.120
Mr Morrel, I tell you,
this boy is out of control.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.660
I don't want to sail
with him anymore.

07:00.950 --> 07:04.200
- You won't sail with him anymore.
 - I warned you.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.500
- Because you won't
sail for me anymore.

07:08.040 --> 07:08.700
Forgiveness?

07:10.450 --> 07:12.620
- How could you let her drown?

07:12.950 --> 07:15.700
- I... saved your
cargo, Lord Morrel.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.750
- Dantes saved
my honor, Danglars.

07:17.910 --> 07:19.830
Captain Danglars, you
are no longer captain.

07:21.370 --> 07:24.330
Go pack your things.

07:24.500 --> 07:28.450
- I will pay your balance.
 - We don't know who this woman is.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.040
I know what you did.
And that's enough for me.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.410
Boy, come here.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.290
Let's go!

07:53.540 --> 07:55.200
Let this be a lesson for you.

07:55.660 --> 07:56.660
Huh?

07:57.200 --> 08:00.370
When you're a man, we
don't hide behind our position

08:00.540 --> 08:01.950
not even under a table.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.790
I present to you

08:05.950 --> 08:08.450
my grandson, Maximilien.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.540
Delighted, Maximilien.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.540
Maximilien, I present
to you Captain Dantes.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.870
Good morning, captain.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.330
So how old...

08:19.120 --> 08:20.040
Captain?

08:20.540 --> 08:23.330
- Yes, try to show yourself
worthy of it, Edmond.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.500
Of course, sir.

08:27.450 --> 08:28.500
Of course.

08:29.410 --> 08:30.580
Huh?

08:51.950 --> 08:52.870
That is good.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.160
She inspires. Edmond!

09:07.250 --> 09:08.910
I can't believe it.

09:09.290 --> 09:11.540
I have to... I have
to tell you something.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.870
Who loves me?

09:13.410 --> 09:15.120
Yes... that. But...

09:15.290 --> 09:17.750
- No, there are no “buts”.
 - Wait.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.370
- But I...
 - Start again.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.910
You kiss a future captain.

09:31.450 --> 09:33.000
- You will be...
 - Yes.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.950
- Then we can...
 - Yes. We will be able to.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.370
I missed you.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.450
I missed you. I missed you.

10:19.580 --> 10:20.700
See you later.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
Edmond!

10:49.080 --> 10:51.540
-Juliette.  Are you well?
 - And you?

10:51.700 --> 10:52.700
Yes.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.700
- How are you?
 - It's Edmond, Louis' son.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.540
- Hello sir.
 - Good morning.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.620
- Where is daddy?  I have to see him.
 - At home.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.750
See you later.

11:12.910 --> 11:13.830
You can smile,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.910
this is good news.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.000
You grimace.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.950
It's joy.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.410
I'm so proud of you.

11:26.950 --> 11:27.830
Captain.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.620
Captain.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.450
Notified Mr. and
Mrs. de Morcerf?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.450
Not yet. I wanted
to tell you first.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.290
Everything is going
to change, dad.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.450
You have to tell them.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.750
- It's all thanks to them.
 - And you too.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.580
I didn't pay for
your naval studies.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.410
Come on, my son.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.120
Go and pay your respects.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.200
So, cheers! I raise my glass

12:14.370 --> 12:16.040
in memory of his mother, Edmond.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.910
Because we miss her

12:18.870 --> 12:20.000
and because she gave birth

12:20.160 --> 12:22.120
Marseille's youngest captain!

12:22.290 --> 12:25.330
- Bravo!
 - Applaud him, he will be uncomfortable.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.120
There, perfect.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.410
But most of all

12:31.580 --> 12:33.330
because Mathilde Dantès

12:33.500 --> 12:36.790
She was the nanny of
a future French couple

12:36.950 --> 12:39.370
to a heroic destiny,

12:39.540 --> 12:41.540
one of the best
officers in Europe,

12:42.120 --> 12:45.540
Call Fernand
Morcerf, to serve you.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.620
Louis, come and toast with
us. This is the opportunity.

12:51.410 --> 12:52.540
Thank you, sir.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.450
Later, perhaps.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.200
You can reprimand Mercédès.
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

12:59.370 --> 13:02.580
Maybe she'll be
late for the wedding.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.000
- Ah, finally!
 - Oh.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.250
Sorry for my delay,

13:05.410 --> 13:07.330
my aunt. Hello uncle.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.330
Horace de Balios

13:08.500 --> 13:11.450
did what he wanted.
I almost hit him.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.080
But anyway, Mercédès.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.660
Who is this gentleman?

13:14.830 --> 13:17.120
It's a horse. He comes
from a very good family.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.870
- Good morning, my cousin.
 - Good morning, my cousin.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.160
Edmond.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.750
Mercédès.

13:24.910 --> 13:29.290
Are you ready for the
party? Edmond has big news.

13:29.950 --> 13:30.750
Yes yes.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.410
Yes, I will be captain.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.870
Pharaoh's
Captain. It's official.

13:40.450 --> 13:41.620
- And truth?
 - Hmm.

13:42.410 --> 13:44.700
- Good job.
 - For the captain!

14:04.410 --> 14:07.330
- I have!
 -Oh!  For your health!

14:08.040 --> 14:11.540
- I'm happy for you.
 - Me too.  I am happy

14:11.700 --> 14:14.580
- for me.  Health.
 - Are you going to buy a new uniform?

14:16.160 --> 14:17.160
And a new salary.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.040
He will be able to enjoy life,

14:19.200 --> 14:20.750
to take advantage
of the good weather.

14:20.910 --> 14:22.000
We will explain it to you.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.700
I will be able to get
married, above all.

14:27.040 --> 14:27.950
What?

14:28.660 --> 14:29.830
You will be my witness.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.700
- Don't count on it!
 - Well, yes!

14:31.870 --> 14:35.120
The witness of a waste!
Mercédès, say something.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.410
- I tried, but he's madly in love.
 - Oh, completely crazy.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.500
And does she know this?
Finally, does she agree?

14:44.950 --> 14:46.330
Yes. From what she told me,

14:46.500 --> 14:47.790
- Yes yes.
 - I know.

14:49.290 --> 14:50.290
It's Juliet.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.370
- Who?
 - The seamstress with the naughty face.

14:53.540 --> 14:56.660
No! No, it's not Juliette.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.410
No, it's a real woman,

15:01.080 --> 15:02.080
very beautiful.

15:02.580 --> 15:03.950
Not just pretty.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.620
Hmm.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.200
- Mysterious and captivating.
 - Yes!  No no,

15:09.370 --> 15:11.160
- Yes yes.
 - But who is it?

15:15.950 --> 15:17.370
She is your cousin.

15:18.870 --> 15:21.370
Mercédès Herrera de Morcerf.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.290
You?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.370
- Yes.
 - Let's get married.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.580
But she's completely crazy.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.580
And your mother
will never want to.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.750
- Do you think mom
can refuse me anything?

15:33.250 --> 15:36.870
Then you will convince her. She
was always your favorite niece.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.790
AMEN!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I carry it here,

17:31.370 --> 17:32.580
signed by Mr. de Villefort,

17:32.750 --> 17:33.950
King's Attorney,

17:34.120 --> 17:36.790
an arrest warrant for the
man named Edmond Dantès.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.790
- Follow us.

17:40.950 --> 17:42.000
What's going on?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.750
- No, leave it.
 - There must be an explanation.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.620
- Come.
 - Let me go.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.910
- Wait.
 - Fernand, do something!

17:49.080 --> 17:51.450
- What is it? My son
didn't do anything.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.830
This must be a misunderstanding.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.040
Where are they taking
him? I will accompany you.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.750
- We must take him alone, sir.
 - Lieutenant.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.540
Lieutenant Fernand de Morcerf.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.120
Tell your friends
to let us pass.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.790
It's a real order.

18:06.290 --> 18:07.330
I'll take care of it.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.330
- Please follow us now.
 -Edmond!

18:11.450 --> 18:13.330
I will be back, my love.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.660
Edmond Dantès, Mr. Attorney.

18:53.830 --> 18:54.950
Leave us.

19:03.830 --> 19:07.330
I've always admired
sailors like you, Mr. Dantès.

19:07.870 --> 19:09.620
I'm just afraid of the sea.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.450
It's true, this endless abyss.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.500
These black waters.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.120
A monster always seems ready
to come out and devour you.

19:25.410 --> 19:29.660
- What am I being accused of? Why
am I being arrested at my wedding?

19:29.830 --> 19:33.080
Do you have any
enemies, Lord Dantes?

19:34.790 --> 19:36.160
A... an enemy?

19:36.950 --> 19:38.040
Or jealous.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.450
Just been named captain, You're
going to marry a beautiful match...

19:44.290 --> 19:46.790
It might have made
people jealous.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.410
I don't know, no.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.620
I had a disagreement
recently with a crew member,

19:52.790 --> 19:54.500
But what could he accuse me of?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.160
I don't know.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.870
To be a Napoleonic
agent, for example.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.330
Forgiveness?

20:04.500 --> 20:06.410
But... that doesn't make sense.

20:11.950 --> 20:15.120
- We found this
Bible in your cabin.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.000
Is this your Bible?

20:18.540 --> 20:20.540
It has your name written on it.

20:21.830 --> 20:24.870
Yes, finally, it is
still not a crime.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.450
And truth.

20:27.250 --> 20:31.830
But we also found a
mission order inside

20:32.450 --> 20:35.080
signed in Napoleon's own hand.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.410
And that is a crime.

20:37.950 --> 20:38.950
Wait.

20:39.790 --> 20:42.750
No, this is the first time
I have seen this letter.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.540
If there is no enemy, who
could have put it there?

20:49.370 --> 20:53.040
Off the coast of Cape Corso, I
saved a young girl from drowning.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.830
Did she thank you in your cabin?

20:56.000 --> 20:56.830
No.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Danglars locked her
there. She left in Marseilles.

21:00.870 --> 21:02.450
You can check.

21:02.830 --> 21:06.660
Ask the foreman
Gaspar Caderousse.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.080
- Caderousse?
 - Yes.

21:09.910 --> 21:11.120
What do you know about her?

21:11.540 --> 21:12.540
Nothing.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.250
Mr Dantes.

21:14.950 --> 21:17.200
I interviewed dozens
of conspirators

21:17.370 --> 21:19.330
and I don't think
it's one of them.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.830
I would like to help a
friend of the Morcerfs,

21:23.410 --> 21:25.290
but I need you to help me.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.910
I swear I don't know
anything about her.

21:31.870 --> 21:33.540
She told me her name was Angèle.

21:34.540 --> 21:35.660
That's all.

21:43.620 --> 21:44.540
You...

21:44.870 --> 21:47.700
Did you reveal this young
woman's name to anyone?

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
No.

21:51.790 --> 21:53.580
Not even for this Caderousse?

21:54.120 --> 21:55.120
No.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.620
For no one. word of honor.

21:58.700 --> 22:02.160
You see, Mr. Dantès,
I believe in you.

22:03.910 --> 22:07.250
However, I will be forced
to keep it a little longer,

22:07.410 --> 22:09.700
time to question
the rest of the crew.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.950
If they confirm your testimony,
of which I have no doubt,

22:13.120 --> 22:17.290
I will return you to your bride, that
you will have a lot of time to hate me.

22:17.450 --> 22:19.580
Count on her.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.870
Fernand will bring
it back to you.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.080
I can't take it
anymore, I'm going.

22:30.870 --> 22:32.750
There's nothing more I can do.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.160
It would be good for you
if they didn't release him.

22:38.410 --> 22:41.200
How can you say such horrors?

22:59.790 --> 23:03.500
Gérard, whatever they told
you about Dantès, I guarantee it.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.750
Leave us a moment, gentlemen.

23:19.450 --> 23:21.660
Fernand, I'm so
sorry about your friend.

23:22.450 --> 23:23.750
I know your connections.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.830
But he doesn't know everything.

23:28.620 --> 23:32.000
We found a mission order
from the Emperor on him.

23:32.750 --> 23:35.790
And his companions say
he is one of their supporters.

23:37.410 --> 23:40.330
I think you understand the
seriousness of these accusations.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.370
He was arrested before
marrying Mercédès

23:44.540 --> 23:46.790
and that the irreparable
is not committed,

23:47.450 --> 23:49.830
but if you're willing to vouch,

23:50.540 --> 23:53.120
If you think these
two men are lying...

23:55.000 --> 23:56.910
If you are willing
to take that risk,

23:57.500 --> 23:58.870
then I will set you free.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.450
You only have one word to say.

24:10.370 --> 24:11.370
No.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.700
No?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.580
He doesn't deserve it...

24:27.540 --> 24:29.080
What doesn't he deserve?

24:33.160 --> 24:35.450
May our family
name be tarnished.

24:45.330 --> 24:47.200
If Dantes betrayed us,

24:48.830 --> 24:50.540
may he suffer
the fate of traitors.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.370
I can be sure...

24:54.290 --> 24:57.660
May no lawsuit tarnish the
reputation of the Morcerfs.

25:00.870 --> 25:03.040
I'll need your testimony.

25:16.450 --> 25:18.000
Do you understand
what is happening?

25:20.870 --> 25:22.450
So shut up.

25:31.870 --> 25:35.750
- Mr. Dantès?
 - Were you able to speak to the prosecutor?

25:35.910 --> 25:37.540
- Yes sir.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.120
This is a day I will not forget.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.250
Won't you take me home?

25:47.790 --> 25:49.040
No, in fact.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.450
Let's go.

25:52.330 --> 25:55.080
What is happening?
What is happening?

25:55.250 --> 25:56.080
Let me go.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.870
Call the Prosecutor I
spoke to the Prosecutor!

25:59.040 --> 26:01.120
Talk to him. Talk to him!

26:01.290 --> 26:04.830
I'm innocent! I didn't
do anything! Let me go.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.370
Shh, shh, shh.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.290
You would have been guilty, you
would have been hanged. We take you,

26:23.450 --> 26:26.250
because he knows things
we don't want to hear.

26:29.750 --> 26:30.700
Let's go.

26:43.750 --> 26:44.750
Stop.

26:45.580 --> 26:46.910
Stop!

26:55.200 --> 26:56.540
Let me go!

27:11.620 --> 27:12.830
Where is he?

27:13.250 --> 27:14.750
I couldn't do anything.

27:17.580 --> 27:18.580
Mercédès.

27:19.370 --> 27:20.370
Leave me.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.330
It wouldn't do any good.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.830
-Mercédès...
 - To stop.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.120
Please.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.370
What's wrong, Victoria?

27:58.540 --> 28:01.830
- Aren't you happy to see me?
 - Your sister is here.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.540
Miss de Villefort.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.620
Clandestine suits you perfectly.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.370
Sorry I can't return
the compliment.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.580
Brandy? Sorry,
I'm out of sea water.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.120
Yes, it's my job to
know everything.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.750
So you know that
Dantes is innocent.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.620
Innocent... Yes.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.750
Who is really innocent?

28:41.040 --> 28:44.040
He didn't do anything.
Why did you stop him?

28:44.620 --> 28:46.660
But to save your life.

28:46.830 --> 28:48.040
My life or your reputation?

28:50.250 --> 28:52.450
- We are both in politics.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.330
In politics, we do
not exclude a man,

28:55.500 --> 28:57.080
we have removed an obstacle.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.200
I knew that he practiced
his profession with cruelty,

29:00.370 --> 29:02.950
but I expected you
to do it honestly.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.290
Why don't you
report it in his place?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.910
But I will, Gérard.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.450
If you refuse to
save him, I will.

29:12.290 --> 29:14.700
But would you rather
people ignore my existence,

29:15.370 --> 29:16.620
Victoria's,

29:17.080 --> 29:18.290
Your lover,

29:18.540 --> 29:20.200
and your future child.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.830
That's exactly what I thought.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.080
Alive?

30:06.580 --> 30:07.750
Alive.

30:20.330 --> 30:22.660
Alive?

30:23.700 --> 30:24.700
Alive!

30:33.290 --> 30:34.290
Alive?

30:35.620 --> 30:36.620
Alive.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.870
Go far away...
Leave the coast...

32:02.040 --> 32:05.200
And who knows the
way... Who knows exactly...

33:00.330 --> 33:03.250
Is anyone there?
Is anyone there?

33:10.580 --> 33:13.250
There is someone.
There is someone.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.120
Is anyone there?

33:18.410 --> 33:20.620
There is someone.
There is someone.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.330
There is someone.

33:37.660 --> 33:38.620
- Who are you?

33:39.410 --> 33:42.250
Uh, I... Dantès, Edmond Dantès.

33:43.290 --> 33:44.750
- How old are you?

33:45.910 --> 33:48.700
- Your voice sounds like a young man.
 - I have...

33:51.910 --> 33:53.500
I don't know anymore.

33:53.660 --> 33:57.200
I was 22 years old...
when they locked me up.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.540
May 16, 1815.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.540
It was four years ago.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.950
He is 26 years old.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.620
Four years?

34:14.540 --> 34:15.540
AND...

34:16.909 --> 34:19.250
And you, who are you?

34:21.290 --> 34:22.540
A prisoner.

34:24.370 --> 34:25.330
Like you.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.620
How long has it been?

34:28.830 --> 34:29.699
Shh!

34:29.870 --> 34:30.790
What?

34:30.949 --> 34:32.370
- They're coming.
 - Wait.

34:32.540 --> 34:33.409
Don't leave me.

34:34.080 --> 34:36.750
Who are you? At
least tell me your name.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.120
Your name!

34:42.250 --> 34:43.330
Scams

34:45.120 --> 34:47.080
34! Alive?

34:49.330 --> 34:50.159
Alive.

37:05.660 --> 37:07.200
I was waiting for you.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.700
Do you really think
you can get out of here?

37:17.870 --> 37:19.750
I dug 30 m in six years.

37:20.370 --> 37:23.040
To bypass your cell
and reach the outside,

37:24.040 --> 37:26.370
you will have to
dig twice as long.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.250
12 years?

37:28.620 --> 37:32.410
Maybe a little less, now
that there will be two of us.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.870
For what? Do you
have other plans?

37:40.410 --> 37:41.410
No.

37:42.620 --> 37:46.080
I am Abbot Faria.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.080
Edmond Dantes.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.160
Have you never seen this letter?

38:19.330 --> 38:21.200
No, never.

38:25.830 --> 38:29.290
And you? Do you
know why you're here?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.370
- Yes.

38:36.910 --> 38:40.080
They wanted to silence you.
Me, they wanted to make me talk.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.700
I choose people I trust.

38:52.290 --> 38:53.910
Don't know Italian?

38:56.080 --> 39:00.330
- No.
 - English, Arabic, Latin, Greek?

39:01.750 --> 39:03.410
I only know the sea.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.450
If you want, I'll teach you.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.750
With patience and desire,...

39:13.700 --> 39:15.790
in 6 or 7 years, You will
know everything I know.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.950
History, philosophy,

39:21.410 --> 39:22.700
mathematics.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.580
These are...

39:24.750 --> 39:26.290
These are weapons

39:27.410 --> 39:30.080
that are as liberating as this.

39:32.410 --> 39:33.410
Hmm.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.370
What's the first thing
you're going to do

40:37.910 --> 40:39.330
if we can leave?

40:42.540 --> 40:44.330
I'm going to find Mercédès.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.200
What would you do if
she didn't wait for you?

40:52.330 --> 40:54.200
So I won't have
anything anymore.

40:54.950 --> 40:57.500
I'm going to tell you
a story, Edmond.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.330
He inspires.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.040
700 years ago,

41:02.450 --> 41:05.040
in Jerusalem, during
the first crusade,

41:06.750 --> 41:07.750
the knights

41:07.910 --> 41:11.450
responsible for protecting Christ's tomb,
they created the order of the Templars.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.750
On the first day,

41:13.910 --> 41:17.540
there are only a few of them,
but they have immense faith.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.450
Thanks to your victories,

41:22.160 --> 41:24.660
the Order
accumulates a fortune...

41:26.500 --> 41:28.000
considerable.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.330
Consi... Considerable.

41:33.410 --> 41:36.870
I tell you about the greatest treasure
that the Earth has ever carried.

41:38.410 --> 41:39.120
AND...

41:41.000 --> 41:42.370
over time,

41:43.620 --> 41:46.160
his power, his wealth,
make people jealous.

41:47.410 --> 41:51.870
And on Friday, October 13th, 1307,
the king of France, Philip the Fair,

41:52.040 --> 41:54.000
orders his arrest

41:54.160 --> 41:55.870
and seizure of their assets.

41:57.830 --> 42:00.370
But no one ever
found the treasure.

42:04.580 --> 42:05.700
He knows...

42:07.700 --> 42:11.290
What did these knights do
with this immense fortune?

42:12.580 --> 42:14.450
- No.
 - Nothing!

42:16.040 --> 42:18.200
Edmond, nothing.

42:18.950 --> 42:20.750
Too busy getting revenge,

42:22.200 --> 42:25.370
to punish those
who betrayed them,

42:25.910 --> 42:28.040
they died one after the other.

42:30.700 --> 42:32.250
Well, almost everyone.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.290
The last of them

42:36.950 --> 42:38.700
it was Cardinal Spada.

42:40.330 --> 42:45.080
At the end of his life, taking
refuge on the island of Monte Cristo,

42:46.500 --> 42:49.540
he had time to
train one last knight.

42:51.370 --> 42:53.290
This young man was called...

42:53.910 --> 42:55.580
Giuseppe Faria.

42:59.540 --> 43:02.500
I am the last survivor, Edmond.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.200
He inspires. And I know

43:05.370 --> 43:07.250
where is the treasure.

43:09.950 --> 43:10.870
Half of that

43:11.040 --> 43:13.250
comes back to you today.

43:14.700 --> 43:17.080
But what will you
do with this fortune?

43:20.830 --> 43:22.370
It will do good

43:24.080 --> 43:26.790
or will you let your
heart fill with hate?

44:18.120 --> 44:19.500
I'm going to empty the bag.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.000
Edmond.

44:25.250 --> 44:26.120
Huh?

44:29.200 --> 44:30.250
She's salty.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.160
The water is salty.

44:34.830 --> 44:38.040
We're almost there.
It's a matter of days.

44:44.910 --> 44:46.790
We are there, we are there.

44:48.500 --> 44:49.250
I will be back.

44:54.830 --> 44:55.620
Stay away!

45:05.200 --> 45:06.000
Abbot?

45:11.040 --> 45:13.250
Abbot? Abbot?

45:15.250 --> 45:16.500
He groaned.

45:33.660 --> 45:34.580
Then.

45:34.750 --> 45:37.250
-Edmond.
 - No, no, don't talk.

45:37.410 --> 45:39.330
I'll ask for help.

45:39.500 --> 45:40.500
No.

45:40.910 --> 45:42.750
It's too late.

45:44.830 --> 45:46.830
Don't be sad.

45:49.950 --> 45:53.790
You have been the only
consolation in my life.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.660
The Lord gave me...

45:57.620 --> 45:59.750
a little late, but
he gave it to me.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.580
I'm not crazy, Edmond. He cries.

46:07.540 --> 46:08.660
I know.

46:10.370 --> 46:12.160
The treasure exists.

46:13.790 --> 46:15.370
You know where to find it.

46:16.330 --> 46:18.660
Let's go together!

46:18.830 --> 46:20.080
Don't forget.

46:20.540 --> 46:22.620
Monte Cristo.

46:23.540 --> 46:25.540
Monte Cristo.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.950
Mount...

46:29.120 --> 46:30.000
Abbot?

46:30.790 --> 46:31.790
Abbot.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.620
The abbot?

46:35.950 --> 46:37.200
Don't leave me.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.040
Don't leave me. Eh?

46:41.330 --> 46:42.580
Don't leave me.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.410
Alive?

47:04.790 --> 47:05.790
Alive!

47:11.290 --> 47:13.160
Alive?

47:15.290 --> 47:16.370
Number 17?

47:18.620 --> 47:19.750
Oh, 17!

47:43.500 --> 47:44.790
Abbot?

48:11.160 --> 48:12.200
Oh, Abbot?

48:23.910 --> 48:26.750
Oh! He's dead, throw the bag!

49:09.750 --> 49:12.500
Moans of effort

49:26.120 --> 49:27.120
What it is?

49:27.700 --> 49:28.450
The abbot.

49:41.870 --> 49:42.870
Alive?

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Alive!

50:04.580 --> 50:06.790
Alive?

50:14.290 --> 50:16.540
Alive?

50:44.120 --> 50:44.910
Standing.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.120
Standing!

50:49.250 --> 50:50.330
I said get up!

50:56.000 --> 50:56.830
Alert!

51:00.870 --> 51:01.620
ONE...

51:01.790 --> 51:03.580
Alert!

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
TWO...

51:05.870 --> 51:06.700
Alert!

51:07.330 --> 51:08.370
AND THREE!

54:30.500 --> 54:32.700
Hey! There's nothing to do here.

54:32.870 --> 54:33.870
Go away!

54:34.540 --> 54:37.410
I came to see
Louis. Louis Dantes.

54:37.830 --> 54:39.330
Did you know Louis?

54:40.000 --> 54:40.910
Yes.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.700
We buried him, poor Louis.

54:44.700 --> 54:46.330
A long time ago.

54:50.450 --> 54:52.080
No, it's not possible.

54:52.250 --> 54:55.120
He died of hunger
when his son died.

54:56.450 --> 54:58.000
He wanted to join him.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.290
But his...

55:04.450 --> 55:06.330
But your son is not dead.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.330
Sorry.

55:15.950 --> 55:17.750
Were you also a sailor?

55:18.660 --> 55:20.410
- Yes.
 - Hmm.

55:20.870 --> 55:24.450
I'll give you something to eat.
But then it disappears, right?

55:30.290 --> 55:33.000
And Mercé... Mercédès?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.580
And Fernand de Morcerf?

55:35.750 --> 55:38.540
- It must have been 7 or 8
years since they last came.

55:38.950 --> 55:41.870
They have lived in Paris
since the birth of their son.

55:44.700 --> 55:46.080
It's very late.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.910
Avoid the Ligurian Sea

56:47.080 --> 56:49.000
and their incessant patrols.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.450
Head to Sardinia.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.580
You can stop in Santa
Teresa di Gallura.

56:57.450 --> 56:59.830
The island of Monte
Christ is located

57:00.000 --> 57:02.410
west of the Tuscan Archipelago.

57:22.790 --> 57:25.450
It will land in the far south.

57:25.620 --> 57:30.330
I know you will be impressed
by its austere beauty.

57:31.870 --> 57:35.750
I envy him discovering
this for the first time.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.200
Then.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.830
It's there.

57:41.290 --> 57:44.290
The vault of the
illustrious Spada family.

57:44.660 --> 57:46.160
The rest, Edmond,

57:47.450 --> 57:48.700
It's your story.

57:51.450 --> 57:54.540
That of a man who has the world

57:55.290 --> 57:57.160
in the palm of your hand.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.200
Marseille One year later

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:43.080
- Please go ahead.
 - Stop.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.160
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
 - No no.  Gaspar, get out.

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:48.660
Mr. Caderousse
is a friend of mine.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.450
On his deathbed, Edmond
Dantes asked me to share

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.120
among those who
were important to him.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:12.620
He thought he had been
denounced by a certain Danglars.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:18.160
But he was convinced that two
men had remained loyal to him.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580
He told me:

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.370
“One is called
Gaspard Caderousse,

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:26.290
"and the second,
Fernand de Morcerf."

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:29.540
Keep your diamond.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.910
None of us deserve anything.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.120
Wait, my son.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.040
If I reveal to you what I know,
we will know it came from me.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.540
And these people
are rich and powerful.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.790
There's nothing to fear,

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.040
I am bound by the
secrecy of confession.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:47.580
Sit down.

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:59.950
Dantes was right about Danglars.
He was the one who reported him.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.540
But Fernand de Morcerf?
He was your friend.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:11.120
Can you be friends with the
one whose wife you covet?

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.250
For the love of Mercédès,

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.410
he sacrificed Edmond.

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:25.950
He will live. But for
everyone, he will be dead.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.000
Hmm.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.410
The only one who would
deserve Dantès' affection is Morrel.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.370
The ship owner?

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.410
He fought for him
to be released.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:43.290
And he too, Providence
thanked him very little.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.080
After Dantes' arrest,

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.830
had to accept Danglars
back as captain.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.250
But Danglars also betrayed him.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:54.200
Destroyed half of his fleet,

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:57.450
allegedly stolen by pirates.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.870
Ruined, Morrel had
to sell the company.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.370
And guess who
bought it for a pittance?

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.830
Danglars.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.040
Two months later,
the boats reappeared.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.370
But the Prosecutor
Villefort did not give in.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.500
It must be said that
they shared a secret.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.700
Little Victoria,
Villefort's lover,

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:22.450
became Madame Danglars.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:26.500
She is a baroness today.

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:30.040
Morrel died in poverty.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.450
And what about you, in
all this, Mr. Caderousse?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.290
You?

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.250
What could I do

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.870
facing a captain, a
count and a procurator?

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:51.580
If I had been braver, I probably
would have ended up like her.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.540
She?

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.290
Angele.

01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:02.200
She had gone to see her
brother to save Dantès.

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.620
I freed myself

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.870
by Dantes. It's up
to you to get rid of it.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.160
Look? I also have friends.

01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:15.500
What happened?

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.700
Was she killed?

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.580
She would have suffered less.

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:24.620
Danglars had
other plans for her.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.790
He sold it to the Maillard brothers,
the basket masters of Toulon.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:30.830
The little one was beautiful,

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.750
got a good price for it.

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:36.790
He knew everything
and did nothing.

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.080
I'm ashamed, Father.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.160
One day I will return.

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:46.910
And I will offer you the
opportunity to redeem yourself.

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:07.040
I no longer come to pray
for you or look for you,

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.660
but just to let you know:

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.700
I will do what you couldn't do.

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:17.540
From now on, I'm the one
who rewards and punishes.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.450
Do you want something?

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.410
- Who are you?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.580
Years ago,

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.250
you told me:

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.870
"I will not forget your
courage, but forget my name."

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:58.000
Well, I haven't forgotten
your name or your courage.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.120
Dantes.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.120
I came to get you, Angèle.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.200
For me, it's too late.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.160
But it can save the child.

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.290
The child?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.910
When I arrived here,

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.500
I only had one idea in mind:

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.120
take revenge on my brother.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.700
For weeks, I searched
for a way to escape.

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:57.540
One day, the opportunity
presented itself. I ran away.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.000
With a client.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:04.660
A carpenter from Paris.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.500
I knew that Gérard had
been appointed there.

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.750
I found Victoria's trail,

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:16.250
your lover.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.660
I wanted to continue
the story where it left off.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.040
It was very cold.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.790
That night...

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:34.410
Gérard would have to die.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:38.040
Nothing could stop me.

01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:42.830
I can still feel the metal
of the knife in my hand.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.000
But nothing went as planned.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.290
Victoria's crying.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:03.160
When Gérard went out into the
garden, he was carrying a trunk.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.160
I followed him.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.700
I got closer when... baby crying

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.830
When I heard the
muffled cry of a child.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:33.370
I couldn't leave her.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.450
He still had his mother's
blood in his body.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.790
Between revenge and life...

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:50.540
I chose life.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.040
I ran away with him.

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:02.160
I didn't know anyone in Paris.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.790
Then I went back to my store.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.830
But the brothers
Maillard found him.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.620
And they were waiting for me.

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:23.910
Angele...

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:28.910
What happened to the child?

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.080
Hello André.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.830
Angèle made me come get you.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.410
For what?

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.120
She will die.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.290
I'll take you to her so
she can say goodbye.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.830
Then we will leave.

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:21.830
Let's take...

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.790
all the time needed to be ready.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.200
Ready to do what?

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.830
To get revenge, André.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.910
Take revenge on the
three men who stole his life,

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.200
yours

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.790
and mine.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.660
- I want to kill them.
 - That would be very easy.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.330
Very sweet.

01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:48.410
No.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.200
We have to rip out their hearts.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:55.950
- Who are you?

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.160
- I am the Count
of Monte Cristo.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500
{\an8}Paris Five years later

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.910
General de Morcerf decided
today to abandon the army

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.250
to dedicate his life to politics,
in the Chamber of Peers.

01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.910
The French army
loses a great soldier,

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.950
but France gains a great man.

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.200
Fernand de Morcerf

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:25.750
fought in Moscow, in Leipzig,

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:26.910
in Türkiye...

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.290
Everywhere, at the risk
of his life, he defended

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.790
a certain idea of ​​the
kingdom of France.

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:38.120
Fernand paid the price of his
commitment and respect in the flesh

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:39.620
of the given word.

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:43.120
10 years ago,
while France's ally

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:46.910
Ali Paxá de Janina was
surrounded by Turkish troops,

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.620
Colonel de Morcerf
threw everything.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.080
At the head of a
squadron of brave soldiers,

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:57.120
achieved a breakthrough
behind the Ottomans

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:59.700
to come and give your
ally a helping hand.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.120
This act of insane courage

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:07.200
unfortunately it will not have been
enough, but all the French know it:

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:10.000
“We do not fight in
the hope of success!

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.120
"No! No, it's much more
beautiful when it's useless."

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:02.040
Is it better?

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.790
He wasn't very attentive
to Eugénie Danglars.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.500
- Father.
 - She will have 2 million dowry,

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.160
on the wedding day.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:15.370
Fernand!

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.620
So I must pay
attention to his fortune.

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.700
Better minus a
medal and plus a zero.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.790
Our son is a man of his time.
He's a romantic who believes in...

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.500
Return the medal!

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
There!

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.250
That's enough.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.580
If I had known the honor of your
visit, I would have prepared for it.

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.750
If I had known the honor of your
visit, I would have prepared for it.

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:18.750
Outside!

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:25.000
Gentlemen... If I had
known the honor of your visit,

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.080
I would have prepared for that.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:30.290
I'm sorry to receive
you in a makeshift home.

01:19:30.450 --> 01:19:32.450
I've been in France
for a short time.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.160
Count, I'm ashamed
to bother you,

01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:37.870
but we can never
thank you enough.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.500
I'm sure he would have
done the same for me.

01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:44.950
Count, I owe you my life.

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.500
I'm glad to see you
back on your feet.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.500
I ordered repairs to
the cross that had split.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.200
It's yours now.

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:02.290
Thank you very much,
but I can't accept it.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.750
I already owe you a debt
that I don't know how to pay.

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:13.660
Do you like weapons?

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.330
Please.

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:35.660
It's one of my most
beautiful pieces.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.910
Ottoman style pistol.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.080
Yes, but the iron guard
engraved with foliage

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:46.080
indicates that this barrel is
of European manufacture.

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:48.790
From Venice, actually.

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:50.830
You are a connoisseur.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.830
My father fought
against Sultan Khursit

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.120
alongside Ali Paxá.

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:56.700
Morcerf.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.620
Is it the famous
general from Morcerf?

01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.120
I'm very impressed.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.450
Would you be willing to try?

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:06.660
Unfortunately, I am
expected in the Chamber.

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:09.290
- Next time.
 - It'll only take a moment.

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:39.580
You deserve your reputation,

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:40.750
in general.

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:43.700
Let's change the
target to you, Albert.

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.620
Remind me never to challenge you

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:57.410
for a duel.

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:00.950
Thank you for leaving your
son with me for a few hours.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.040
I can't wait to learn more about the one
that providence has placed in my path.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.660
I will participate in Baron
Danglars' hunt on Sunday.

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:09.200
Join us.

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:13.700
I won't be able to, I have to
welcome Prince Cavalcanti's son.

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:17.290
Come on, both of us.
There will be enough deer.

01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:19.620
See you soon.

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:21.870
Until Sunday, I hope.

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.870
Everything is fine?

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:33.120
I kept a small metal souvenir
away from my Ottoman stay.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.000
Prefer to sing the
song with guns?

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.620
Follow me.

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:53.910
Please forgive me.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.290
I had no intention of
disrespecting... your wife.

01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:01.410
Haydée is not my wife.
She is my goddaughter.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.410
After you.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200
Haydee.

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.080
What a wonderful name.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.000
It is a very common
name in Greece.

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:15.790
It could be translated as...
modesty or... innocence.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:25.200
May I ask you to
introduce me to Haydée?

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.750
He seems like a
trustworthy young man.

01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:34.750
Furthermore, I will introduce you to
Haydée, but you must make me a promise.

01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:36.290
I will do this for
you in advance.

01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:38.790
I'm not kidding.

01:25:41.290 --> 01:25:43.410
Never try to seduce her.

01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:47.040
So you think I'm dangerous?

01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:48.290
No.

01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:50.540
But she is.

01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.950
If you don't keep your promise,
she will break your heart

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.750
and his.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.450
- But...
 - She's not ready to love yet.

01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:05.040
The secret to your voice
can be found in your past.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.750
After her father's murder,
she was sold to a Vlach tribe.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.040
That's where I met
and welcomed her.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.200
You know, there are
sorrows and heartaches

01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:18.410
that take years to heal.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.870
They leave a veil over souls.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.870
Never try to lift
this veil, Albert.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.540
I promise.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.120
Good.

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:38.000
You will walk softly,
without a glance at us.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.330
You're only going to turn
around when I call you.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.080
Haydee.

01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.910
Alberto de Morcerf, I
present to you Haydée.

01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:53.120
Delighted.

01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:55.120
Enchanted.

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.250
Nice to meet you, miss.

01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:01.410
What if he doesn't
want to meet me?

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.950
He will.

01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:06.120
Stand up!

01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:08.540
To stand is to survive.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.580
Hide that we grew up in
poverty, it's about surviving.

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:13.790
Do you understand? Why, André?

01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:17.790
Because I am Prince
Andreia Cavalcanti.

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:21.370
- Cavalcanti, doesn't that mean goat?
 - What?

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:24.450
Don't be surprised.
Hear me say "what"?

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:25.620
Resume.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.620
I am the prince
Andrea Cavalcanti.

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:33.200
- You don't have an accent,
prince. How is this done?

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:37.200
A very strict teacher
made me lose it with a stick.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.700
Insolence. Your elbows.

01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:45.000
Dear Count,

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.410
- Pleasure to meet you.
 - Allow me a secret.

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:52.410
French life is still unknown
to me, please excuse me

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.870
if my manners seem too Slavic,
Neapolitan or Arabic to you.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.250
This is the Count of Monte Cristo
and Prince Andrea Cavalcanti.

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:39.000
- Sirs.
 - Count.

01:28:40.290 --> 01:28:41.120
Prince.

01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:45.080
Meeting your father, no
matter how disturbing it is,

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:48.910
should not distract you from
your target: Baron Danglars.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.540
Thanks to the stolen boats,
made a fortune in slavery.

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:56.000
- Your reputation precedes you.
 - Don't be fooled by his smile.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.500
He is brutal. He not only
knows this, but is proud of it.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:01.290
Can I make you a confession?

01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:06.330
French life is still unknown to
me, I will ask you to forgive me

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:10.330
if my manners seem too Slavic,
Neapolitan or Arabic to you.

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:14.620
When you are rich, you can
never be too much at anything.

01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:16.040
Your daughter is
your weak point.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.160
Prince.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:18.750
Baron.

01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:20.450
- Eugénie.
 - Is the terrain good?

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.040
- It's perfect.
 - Then let's go.

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:24.790
On horseback, gentlemen.

01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:00.790
Your Honor, Count.

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.540
Thank you very much,

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.700
but I did it a long time ago

01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:08.540
the oath to kill just
to defend myself.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.700
So let me come to your defense.

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:13.950
Perfect.

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.080
Prince.

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:18.540
You're welcome.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.790
Let's have lunch.

01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:19.910
Eugénie?

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:27.000
- Thanks. Suzanne, I present
to you Prince Andrea Cavalcanti,

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.290
the Italian protégé
of Monte Cristo.

01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:30.790
He takes care of me.

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:33.910
My father is afraid that the beauties
of Paris make me do stupid things.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.750
Speaks French perfectly.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:40.500
A very strict teacher made
me lose my accent with sticks.

01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:43.830
- But it's horrible.
 - It's false, above all.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.290
- My mother is French.
 - What an idiot.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.000
Glad you could join us.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.790
His protégé's hand
did not tremble.

01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:54.500
The animal didn't even suffer.

01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:57.620
And this is an execution
expert talking to you.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.410
Do you often bump heads?

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.250
Much less than before.
Fashion is for indulgence.

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:08.160
I'm sorry for robbing you of the Count,
but I want to introduce you to someone.

01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:10.450
- Sirs.
 - Sirs.

01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:34.410
Dear.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.910
Finally, I present to you
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:44.250
Lady of Morcerf. My respects.

01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:49.790
Everything is fine?

01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:52.580
Yes, it is...

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.000
It's the emotion of meeting
the man you would cry without.

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:03.370
Lord, I owe you my son's life,

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.410
and for this
benefit I bless you.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:11.660
You reward me generously
for a simple action.

01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:15.330
But I'm glad I
spared him the pain.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.000
I asked the count
to be our guest,

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.540
but so far he has refused.

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.200
Maybe you'll have better luck?

01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:32.080
Will you give me the pleasure and
honor of one day being our guest?

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.370
Certainly, my lady.

01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:39.620
Let me move away. I would
hate to monopolize you.

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.160
But... what's going on?

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:58.410
Do you want me to call someone?

01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.660
Albert.

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.290
What do you know about this man?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Mother.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:09.120
You are always suspicious
of my new acquaintances,

01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:11.120
but the count saved my life.

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:12.910
He's as rich as a king.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.500
What should I fear from him?

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:19.870
You're right.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.080
My terrors are foolish.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.120
Mr. King's attorney,

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:39.750
It is on my honor, as
lieutenant of the royal armies,

01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:42.620
that I attest here that
the name Edmond Dantès

01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:45.620
testified in my presence
on several occasions

01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:47.620
of sympathy for the usurper

01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:51.580
and his desire to take up
arms to overthrow the monarchy.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.790
These words impress me because
Edmond Dantès was my friend,

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:57.750
But I cannot let this
crime go unpunished.

01:36:57.910 --> 01:37:01.250
I have seen many men die
because of traitors to the country.

01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:04.250
That's not how
you're going to sleep.

01:37:04.410 --> 01:37:06.250
I wasn't looking for that.

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.040
Are you afraid of
your nightmares?

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.160
I'm afraid I won't
have it anymore.

01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:19.580
They help me keep
my wounds open.

01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:25.620
Have you seen this again?

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.120
Yes.

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.000
Was she as beautiful
as he remembered?

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:40.370
I thought the pain
would have changed her.

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.540
It must have been short-lived.

01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:50.450
Her eyes were not those of a
woman who was crying a lot.

01:37:57.790 --> 01:38:01.370
- She will regain the taste for tears
when her husband is taken from her.

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:30.750
I pass.

01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:32.790
200...

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.750
more than 500.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:37.200
I give up.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:40.370
I wouldn't invite you to my
table if you knew how to play.

01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:42.790
Then.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.580
There are only three of us left.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.080
I'll leave you alone.

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.000
Two pairs.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500
Good job.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:00.750
Color.

01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:04.450
It has many hearts.

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.540
I'm going to run away
before I ruin my father.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.450
- Come on, Albert.
 - Yes, that's it,

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:13.200
- Go see these ladies.
 - Unhappy in the game, happy in love.

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.700
I like your prince very much.

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.620
He's charming.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.370
I barely know him, to be honest.
Your father is a business relationship.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.000
A good family, without a doubt.

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:32.790
If by “good” is meant “rich”,
yes, it is Italy's second fortune.

01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:34.040
Hmm...

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.950
The second?

01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:38.540
So do you know the first one?

01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:40.660
Don't make me immodest.

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.790
Well, people richer than me.

01:39:45.950 --> 01:39:49.040
His family dreams of seeing
him marry a girl in Paris, but...

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:52.330
If the son is as fickle
as the father, be careful.

01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:54.200
Rest assured,

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:57.080
I distrust everyone in general.

01:39:57.830 --> 01:40:00.250
And from foreigners,
in particular.

01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:03.160
I am also a foreigner.

01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:06.410
You, Count, that doesn't
count. You are a Count.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.830
And it rhymes, have you seen it?

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.910
You are a poet.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.120
About the foreigner,

01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:14.450
L'Impartial was bought
by an Englishman.

01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:15.790
Absolutely,

01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:18.870
a certain Halifax.
One Lord, it seems.

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.790
He buys newspapers
to spread fake news

01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:25.250
and speculate on
the stock market.

01:40:25.410 --> 01:40:27.370
He's a criminal
of the worst kind.

01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:31.540
He doesn't seem to
like this Lord very much.

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.160
Let's say I love
a lot of people,

01:40:34.330 --> 01:40:37.000
but I only hate certain people.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.540
Hating an Englishman is
not a sin. It's common sense.

01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:46.120
Are you leaving already?

01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.870
It's almost midnight. Our
carriage will become a pumpkin.

01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:56.410
Albert.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:57.830
Miss.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.790
I was going to forget your fan.

01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:07.080
Thank you, sir.

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:14.580
- Can I count on you?
 - For?

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:16.910
Join you for dinner

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.370
coming soon to Paris.
I found a place to stay.

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.700
Well... Of course sir.

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:25.540
Good.

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:27.910
See you soon.

01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:36.700
Count.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.870
Lady of Morcerf.

01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:42.700
It left when I arrived.

01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:44.620
I don't see any
connection there.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.870
I wanted to ask for
your forgiveness.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.500
Ask me for forgiveness?

01:41:52.410 --> 01:41:54.330
For my dizziness the other day.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.040
It reminded me of someone I
knew well who passed away

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.910
in tragic circumstances.

01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:06.790
For a moment, I...

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:16.540
It's starting again, I can't
find my words anymore...

01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:22.700
I'm sorry to remind
you of that bad memory.

01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.660
Don't worry, it dissipated.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.330
So much better.

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.790
I wish you a good night.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.200
Count.

01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:48.950
The carriage moves away.

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080
Albert.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.620
“Haydee.

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.450
“I shouldn't write to you.
So I'm not writing to you.

01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:14.700
"I shouldn't know you..."

01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:18.200
I am therefore not suggesting that
you meet at the Jardin des Plantes,

01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:20.040
tomorrow at 5 o'clock.

01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:22.750
This place, where I
won't be tomorrow,

01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:25.500
contains the most
mysterious flowers in Paris.

01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:30.370
It comes from a country nicknamed
the land of clouds and jasmine.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.660
We can count on the
Paris sky for clouds,

01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:35.700
I'll put jasmine in my lapel.

01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:38.200
So I won't tell
you until tomorrow.

01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:40.830
And I haven't been telling
you this since I saw you,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.120
your voice and your
face never leave me.

01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:45.750
Albert.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:52.870
Won't he report us?

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.790
He is very loyal to the count,

01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:57.200
but he has a weakness for me.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.040
It's a strelitzia.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.580
Where I come from, there were
some on a path that leads to the sea.

01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:09.910
It is also called
the bird of paradise,

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.580
pasărea paradisului.

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:14.700
Passarea paradisului?

01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:16.370
Good.

01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:25.500
Why doesn't he have a bride?

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.700
But maybe there is one?

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:31.450
My father would like me to
marry a Baron's daughter.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.410
But I...

01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:36.450
I'm looking for something this
young woman will never have.

01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:42.870
This... indefinite charm that is to
women what perfume is to flowers.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.450
Or what the fruit tastes like.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.160
I don't know if Parisians
like to be caught or tasted,

01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:51.330
but not me.

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:55.290
- That's not what I meant.
 - I was joking with you.

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.540
Will be at dinner
Count on Saturday?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.450
No. I'll serve as an
alibi for my mother

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:03.950
who flees worldliness
like the plague.

01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:05.330
And you?

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:08.290
I don't know your mother,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.790
I don't know what
her tastes are,

01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:12.750
But I share your disgust.

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.080
Neither he nor his
mother will come to dinner.

01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:23.330
But Fernand de
Morcerf will be there.

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:31.910
What's the problem?

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.870
Aren't you talking
to me about Albert?

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.330
There's nothing
to say about that.

01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:54.250
It's normal to doubt.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.870
Be afraid. I understand that.

01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:03.200
But when the time comes,
you need to remember...

01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:04.870
I don't need

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.700
to remind me of what
his father did to mine.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.160
He placed his lips there.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.330
Thanks

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:41.830
- Very expensive.
 - Of course.

01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:45.950
Dear friends.

01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:55.750
Good evening, Victoria.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.120
I also expected
more spectacular,

01:47:02.290 --> 01:47:04.000
There's no point
in making that face.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.660
There will definitely
be surprises inside.

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.660
The baby is crying.

01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:25.620
Hmm...

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.250
He doesn't seem to
have much of an appetite.

01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.750
I've eaten pork and poultry.

01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:40.370
This house is... beautiful.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:43.040
Despite everything,
I feel surprised.

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:45.040
Nothing escapes him.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.040
I thought a man like you would
choose a more central neighborhood,

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.660
like... the Champs-Elysées
or Saint-Germain.

01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:58.000
I bought this house because
I was advised against it.

01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:59.620
For what?

01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:03.660
Well, they say it's haunted.

01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:08.000
A crime would have happened
there... Abominable, years ago.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.790
Be careful, we have the
King's Procurator here.

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:11.790
And truth.

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.080
A child will have
been sacrificed.

01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:18.080
It's horrible.

01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:21.410
Did you buy this house anyway?

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:22.910
You did well.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.910
These ghost stories are nonsense

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.290
invented by malicious servants.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:29.790
Or jealous neighbors.

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:32.370
Think again, Prosecutor.

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:35.000
I lived in Asia and India,

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.540
and it's hard to come back from
this without knowing that it really exists

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.910
a world...

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:42.450
invisible, populated by spirits.

01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:47.410
When I visited this house,...

01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.540
I knew immediately...

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:55.200
I had the strange conviction that
a crime had been committed here.

01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.870
So I asked

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.290
- until I'm alone.
 - But...

01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:01.660
weren't you scared?

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.870
If your conscience is pure,
ghosts don't haunt you.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.000
They talk to you.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:12.120
-And what did they tell you?
 - But yes, what did they tell you?

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:19.540
That night, I settled here.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.870
Right in front
of that fireplace.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:26.910
I smoked a little opium
to be more receptive.

01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:31.120
There is nothing like it to expand
the spectrum of your consciousness.

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.160
And in the sweetness
of the smoke...

01:49:38.290 --> 01:49:41.540
I felt like... suspended.

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:46.040
I hear a knock on the walls.

01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.700
Then a second.

01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:53.790
I lowered my hand.

01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:58.620
And I hear screams coming
from above. I go up the stairs.

01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.250
The screams turn into... moans.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.750
Comes from a room

01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:08.080
at the end of the corridor.

01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:13.080
I push the door and
find myself in a room.

01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:14.750
In the middle there is a bed.

01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:16.370
I put my hand there.

01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:21.950
And I see a woman
writhing in pain.

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:27.660
She gives birth to a child.
She's alone, abandoned.

01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:28.870
She screams.

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.450
And then I feel a
presence behind my back.

01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:36.200
Suddenly.

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:41.040
You terrify these ladies.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.750
And you enchant us.

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.950
Carry on, I beg you.

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.330
Come on, you're
ruining the party.

01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:50.660
I turn around, shaking.

01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:53.580
And at this moment,

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.790
I hear a whisper in my ear.

01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.080
It's a child's voice.

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.370
A child's voice begging me

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:04.660
to free him.

01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:08.580
Finally I found a door,

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.580
a back door I hadn't seen.

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:13.660
I push her.

01:51:14.410 --> 01:51:17.160
Stairs... Lead to the garden.

01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:20.750
And she came back,
the child's voice.

01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:25.040
He told me he had been alone
for a long time. He was crying.

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:26.910
He calls his mother.

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:33.500
That night, I...

01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:35.950
I looked, but...

01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:39.200
the garden was very big.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.790
What... What did you do?

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.200
Forgiveness?

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.000
The garden was very big...

01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:58.330
What did you do?

01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:01.450
Yes.

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:14.330
The next morning we dug.

01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:16.040
Everywhere.

01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:20.040
We uprooted the apple
trees, I returned the path...

01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:21.870
And nothing.

01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:27.450
So I brought a truffled
pig from Périgord.

01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:30.120
So what?

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.120
Since he didn't
find anything either,

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.660
we ate tonight.

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:39.750
Wonderful!

01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:44.370
I said it was just a fable.

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.160
A fable, exactly.

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.000
At least that's what I
thought. Until yesterday.

01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.160
While we were colonized

01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:56.410
the torches for the reception,

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:59.160
one of them broke.

01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:03.000
We dug there and...

01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:05.750
we discovered a chest.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.370
So what?

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.830
What was inside?

01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:13.750
I don't know.

01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:14.790
Like this?

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.540
I waited for it... to open.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.750
What if there is a body?

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.750
We will give you a burial.

01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:49.160
Prosecutor, you may wish

01:53:49.330 --> 01:53:50.330
open it?

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.410
- I beg you, don't open it.
 - That's enough.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.950
Abracadabra!

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.160
Oh, I don't know

01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:29.290
which is true in this story,
but you are a magician,

01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:30.700
Count.

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:39.790
How is it possible? He
spoke as if he were there.

01:54:40.450 --> 01:54:43.290
All these details were... I
thought I was going crazy.

01:54:43.450 --> 01:54:45.200
Calm down, please.

01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:47.750
- Where is our son's body?
 - I don't know.

01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:49.660
- Did you put it there?
 - Yes.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.700
You told me he was
dead! You told me!

01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:54.500
Of course he was dead.

01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:57.000
- So where is he?
 - I don't know.

01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:59.200
- Where is our son?
 - I don't know!

01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:02.790
Shut up, you're
hysterical! I don't know.

01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:05.080
Calm down.

01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:08.290
I know one thing.

01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:10.500
It's just that
before eight days,

01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:13.040
I will know who this
Mr. Monte Cristo is,

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:16.410
where it comes
from, where it goes,

01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:20.290
and why he talks in front of
us about the children we buried.

01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:26.330
Danglars is obsessed with money.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.950
He won't suspect

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.040
from those who don't
ask for it. Morcerf

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.200
Trust me since I saved your son.

01:55:32.370 --> 01:55:33.500
Villefort remains.

01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:35.370
Villefort is the Prosecutor.

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:36.580
He is suspicious.

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:41.580
And thanks to this dinner,
Victoria will demand explanations.

01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:44.120
So, to reassure her
and reassure herself,

01:55:44.290 --> 01:55:45.830
he will investigate.

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.250
And as we always learn
more from malicious mouths,

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.700
it is the Count's
enemy that he will see.

01:55:53.330 --> 01:55:54.700
Mr Halifax.

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.250
What do you want to know?

01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:01.870
If I can harm you,
it will be a pleasure.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.450
The count has already
been in Paris? He claims no.

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:09.620
If he was already
here, I would know.

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.910
But then, do you know
where he was 15 years ago?

01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:16.450
Yes. In India.

01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:18.750
But...

01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:20.200
I must say,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.410
At the time, he still amused me.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.660
But then...

01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:29.950
Then what?

01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:35.120
One night I was
correcting a servant

01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:37.120
who had looked for it well.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.120
But...

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.450
Monte Cristo developed a
passion for these savages,

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:48.500
with its pagan gods,
its absurd magic.

01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:50.160
Ridiculous beliefs.

01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.540
Then he challenged me to a duel.

01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:56.660
By a native?

01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:59.910
But yes! A native!

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.700
Can you believe it?

01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:03.950
Oh.

01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.080
It's hot, don't you
think? How hot!

01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:10.120
I am brought to my fan,
for the love of heaven!

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:12.700
We're suffocating here!

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:16.370
Not this one.

01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:18.080
Thanks.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.700
Hmm. And you,

01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.250
Lord de Villefort?

01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.410
What did he do to you?

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Nothing.

01:57:31.370 --> 01:57:34.700
I don't know whether I should consider
him among my friends or among my enemies.

01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:39.540
If he were your enemy,
you would already know that.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:43.750
He has flaws, but he is not
a man to hide his intentions.

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:44.910
Hmm.

01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:46.580
But...

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.580
take care.

01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:50.000
Mr Prosecutor.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.200
If he becomes your friend,

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:57.870
that will make you my enemy.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.910
Of course.

01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:10.370
Yes.

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:13.500
Thank you, Mr. de
Villefort, It was very pleasant

01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:16.580
discuss with you,
but I have a lot to do.

01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:17.910
Thanks.

01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:20.910
Mr Prosecutor.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.200
Victor.

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:34.040
Count?

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.290
Prepare the
horses, let's go back.

01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:49.660
Now that Villefort
has let his guard down,

01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:52.160
we can prepare our attack.

01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:54.910
I'm going south.

01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:58.700
I'm going back to Danglars' party
for his daughter's 20th birthday.

01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:00.410
I'm counting on you,

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:02.580
André, to get closer to her.

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.330
And in you, Haydée,
to bewitch Albert.

01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:11.160
Go ahead.

01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:14.000
Good.

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:18.120
It can accommodate up to 600
blacks, 700 pushing a little, but...

01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:20.080
I am a humanist.

01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:21.750
I called him Hercules.

01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:26.450
My mother said this is the lineage
of people destined for great things.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.580
And that's your... love phrase.

01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:33.790
And then I read this...

01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.540
I have to tell you something.

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:44.500
Yes?

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:49.040
I would like to love you,

01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:52.120
- but I can't.
 - I know.

01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.200
You won't offer me

01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:58.620
the feelings he has for Suzanne.

01:59:58.790 --> 02:00:00.000
It will be our secret.

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:02.830
It will be our secret.
It will be well kept.

02:00:03.250 --> 02:00:05.250
I know what it's
like to be double.

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.910
I know what it's
like to be double.

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.000
Of not being able
to say who we are.

02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:14.620
I'll be your alibi.

02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.250
The time has come
to redeem yourself.

02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:15.080
Inaudible words

02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:48.040
I live again in dreams

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.370
every second of these
moments with you.

02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:53.790
I will take the memory
of your eyes into my night,

02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:56.620
and I don't want
to talk to anyone

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:58.910
so as not to waste
the echo of your words

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.830
that still trembles in my heart.

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.450
I keep your sheet
music close to me.

02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:08.250
I love the image
you give me of you,

02:02:08.410 --> 02:02:12.200
but also and above all for the
memory that she will carry forever,

02:02:12.370 --> 02:02:15.790
that of a moment in life
that is worth a lifetime.

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:41.950
buzz

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.660
- See you later.
 - See you later.

02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:08.290
Prince.

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:15.580
Eugénie. This party is in
your image, alive and joyful.

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.580
Thank you, Andrea.

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:20.830
It will include the Count of
Monte Christ among your guests?

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:22.580
17.

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:23.870
17?

02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:27.120
You are the 17th to
ask me the question.

02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:29.250
And what does everyone answer?

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.700
That there will be
no 18th. There it is.

02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:38.250
- Excuse me.

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:44.910
miss.

02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:48.370
- Count.  Did your trip go well?
 - Wonderfully.

02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:52.080
- Thanks.
 - Eugénie is impatient

02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:53.870
to see you again, miss.

02:03:54.330 --> 02:03:55.910
Count, will you allow me?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.040
The pleasure is mine.

02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.950
Does the count know
we saw each other?

02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:11.000
I didn't tell you anything.

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:16.000
- Could he have guessed?
 - Only God knows what he is capable of.

02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:19.370
They're beautiful, aren't they?

02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.290
They seem so eager to live.

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.540
We are always in
a hurry to be happy.

02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:28.500
No?

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.450
Do me the honor of your arm.

02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:36.580
I want to take some steps.

02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:16.160
Your hand is shaking.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.620
He seems to be cold.

02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:22.660
We have, in my family,
cold hands but warm heart.

02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.830
Here. That will warm us up.

02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:28.910
Our grapes are
worse than in Sicily

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:32.000
but it will be lenient
with our northern sun.

02:05:32.290 --> 02:05:33.580
I'm sorry.

02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:38.040
Please forgive me, but...

02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:40.250
I never drink.

02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:44.660
Are you going to eat something?

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.000
I'll have to refuse again.

02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:55.200
Mr. Conde, there is an Arab
custom that makes friends forever

02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:58.410
those who shared bread
and salt under the same roof.

02:05:59.410 --> 02:06:00.830
I know you, ma'am.

02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:04.080
But we are in Paris
and not Tangier.

02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:09.410
There is no more eternal friendship
here than sharing bread and salt.

02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.450
But finally... We're
friends, aren't we?

02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:36.580
But definitely.

02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:39.250
Why wouldn't we be?

02:06:43.450 --> 02:06:48.370
So, in the absence of bread and
salt, Share with me some memories.

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:52.700
What do you want to know?

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.410
It's true that you saw so much,

02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:59.370
I traveled so much,

02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:00.870
suffered so much?

02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:03.330
What makes you say that?

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:06.290
Your eyes.

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.040
In every traveler there is the
desire to find or escape something.

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.000
Did you find it?

02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:19.330
I haven't finished my trip yet.

02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:26.080
Do you live alone?

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:31.290
I don't have a sister,
neither son nor father.

02:07:35.370 --> 02:07:39.830
I only have Haydée who,
I'm sure, will leave me soon.

02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:44.830
How can you live like this,

02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.910
without anything to
connect you to life?

02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.000
I loved a young girl.

02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:57.370
That I was going to get married.

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.620
Years ago.

02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:05.830
But when the war came
and took me away from it...

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.620
I thought she would love
me enough to wait for me.

02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:19.700
To remain faithful
to me until the grave.

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.040
But when I came back,

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:27.450
was married.

02:08:31.330 --> 02:08:35.370
Maybe he had a weaker
heart than the others.

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:40.080
I suffered more than
they would have suffered

02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:44.500
- That's all.
 - Did this love remain in your heart?

02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:49.700
We only really loved it once.

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:52.000
No?

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:56.200
Did you see her again?

02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.620
Never.

02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:04.000
Never?

02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:09.700
Never.

02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:19.290
Did you forgive
him his suffering?

02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:24.750
We can only forgive those
who ask us for forgiveness.

02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:31.870
What if she asked you
for forgiveness today?

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:52.830
- Buy L'Impartial! The fleet
Danglars stolen from Marseille!

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.500
L'Impartial, ladies and
gentlemen! L'Impartial!

02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:57.660
Buy!

02:09:57.830 --> 02:10:01.040
How can boats be stolen
from a port in broad daylight?

02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:02.830
Were they at least insured?

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.250
In your opinion?

02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:07.200
Danglars shares collapse
on the stock market.

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:10.040
But thanks to the
army telegraph,

02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:15.410
Danglars will quickly learn
that nothing really happened.

02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:17.080
You had to steal his boats.

02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:19.660
Everything arrives on
time for those who wait.

02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:22.540
You are saved. Their
boats have nothing.

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.250
- What?
 - L'Imparcial lied.

02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:29.000
"The Danglars fleet is still

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:31.750
“afloat moored in
the port of Marseille”!

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:36.450
Thanks. Thank you, my friends.

02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:39.750
Danglars will remember
my words and think...

02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:42.700
Which is a move by the
new boss of L'Impartial,

02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:44.410
our dear Lord Halifax.

02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:45.370
Exactly.

02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:48.000
Monte Cristo was right.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.830
The Englishman uses his
newspaper to speculate about my back.

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:52.830
You should publish denying this.

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:56.120
Especially not.

02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.200
I don't understand.
It is necessary...

02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:59.370
Shh!

02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:01.500
Do you hear?

02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.330
Listen.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.290
The pleasant noise.

02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:09.830
That tasty little noise.

02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:13.660
The sound of falling money.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.620
I don't understand either.

02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:19.870
Think about it. He knows
something that no one knows yet.

02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:24.540
Imagine: you play poker and
know your opponent's game.

02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:26.950
- What are you doing?
 - I'll restart.

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:28.790
Stocks are at
their lowest level.

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:34.450
If you buy them again in two days, I
will have made enormous added value.

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.950
My best chance.

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:37.250
Buy back your shares?

02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:38.910
How much would be needed?

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:40.410
- 500 million.
 - 500 million?

02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:43.830
500 million. But it
must be done today.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.160
Before the market closes and
before this Halifax scum does.

02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:51.080
How can we find
500 million by tonight?

02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.790
Going to see Lord
Halifax's greatest enemy.

02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:26.750
I'm sorry, Baron, but...

02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:29.700
the sea has always
brought me bad luck.

02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:31.500
I'm not buying your shares.

02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:33.750
- Count.
 - However,

02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:37.000
I never refuse to help a
friend and punish an enemy.

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.660
Then I will lend you that money and
you can do with it whatever you want.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.500
And I can guarantee
a 20% interest rate.

02:12:47.950 --> 02:12:49.910
I will lend you
money interest free.

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:53.000
In Sicily they say:

02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.120
“You won’t get rich
off the back of a friend.”

02:12:55.290 --> 02:12:56.540
I insist.

02:12:57.330 --> 02:13:01.250
I had a mortgage
issued on all my assets.

02:13:01.410 --> 02:13:04.870
Therefore, it is not
worth 500 million, but...

02:13:05.250 --> 02:13:07.000
200 million,
that's it, I promise.

02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:09.500
No, Baron, your
word is enough for me.

02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.040
In France we say:

02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:13.370
“Good accounts
make good friends.”

02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:19.330
So be it. For friendship, I
accept your personal guarantees.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.120
In a week, I will
have you reimbursed.

02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:29.160
Let's make this man
from Halifax surrender.

02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:31.410
A complaint is ready.

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.540
I will see to it that I bring
charges against him at trial myself.

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:39.660
I can't wait to be in court
to witness this execution.

02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:04.330
Lord Halifax,
owner of L'Impartial,

02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:06.580
called to testify today

02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:09.250
to respond to
accusations of defamation,

02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:11.660
he had to leave the
country in a hurry.

02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:15.910
But you undertake to ensure
that your representative

02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:18.370
be in this courtroom at 2 p.m.

02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:47.750
Mr. Judge, the comedy
has gone on long enough.

02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:49.250
We are not on the boulevards.

02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:55.700
I ask the representative of
Mr Halifax introduce himself.

02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:06.450
What are you doing?
It's not over yet.

02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:25.580
I am Lord Halifax's
representative.

02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:31.200
I'm in front of you

02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:35.200
because L'Impartial is accused
of having published fake news.

02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:37.450
But I say here

02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:40.200
that the Danglars boats
have effectively disappeared.

02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:42.700
Anyway, my fleet
is in Marseille!

02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:44.000
It's a joke!

02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:48.500
- What proof do you have?
 - It will be enough for you

02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:51.500
to contact the
Marseille captaincy.

02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:55.250
So do you persist
in your statements?

02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:59.700
I persist and sign, Mr Judge.

02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.580
But I want to do it
under my real name.

02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:04.450
Are you an impostor?

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.000
People know me as
Andrea Cavalcanti.

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:14.700
After years on the
streets, I was taken by a big

02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:17.750
and rich family of
the Italian aristocracy.

02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:19.660
I grew up like a thief

02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:21.660
and I ended up
becoming a prince.

02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:26.200
It is not a more honest profession,
but much more enjoyable.

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.000
It's here, in Paris, that I
finally found my real father.

02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:42.410
I was born on November 3, 1815.

02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:46.620
In Auteuil.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:54.660
Judge, that's it...

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.870
Could the defendant present
proof of what he claims?

02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:02.660
I'll be right there,
sir. Attorney.

02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:05.080
Your patience will be rewarded.

02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:12.790
I'm the bastard son of a French
aristocrat and his mistress!

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:20.910
My mother doesn't know
I'm alive because... my father

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.580
I told him that I
had died at birth.

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:27.790
He wrapped me in a
cloth and buried me alive.

02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:33.450
It speaks, sir, of an
attempt at infanticide.

02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:36.700
That's what should have happened

02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:40.500
if my aunt hadn't picked
me up off the ground.

02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:42.290
Who is accusing?

02:17:43.290 --> 02:17:44.950
A respectable man...

02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:46.910
that you all know.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.870
His arm is in this linen.

02:17:59.870 --> 02:18:01.000
My father...

02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:04.080
is none other than the
man I have before me.

02:18:08.410 --> 02:18:10.000
The Prosecutor of Villefort.

02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:19.540
- Or I'll evacuate the room.
 - Slander!

02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:21.330
I will sue you!

02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:23.080
Mr Cavalcanti,

02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:26.870
Do you understand the
seriousness of your accusations?

02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.200
I will not be satisfied with a cloth,
even if it is stained with blood.

02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:34.290
The prosecutor will provide
you with proof of what I say.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:38.290
- But he's delirious!
 - Father.

02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:43.120
Don't make my mother testify.

02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.290
She, I think, has
suffered enough.

02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:58.160
The trial is suspended

02:18:58.330 --> 02:19:01.200
the time of an investigation.
Let's evacuate the room!

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.250
And one.

02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:09.120
-Come on, Victoria, come on!
-Forgiveness.

02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:11.040
Let us through.

02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:25.250
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:29.580
Your father wanted me
as his son-in-law, but...

02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:33.250
I couldn't be, your
mother is mine too.

02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:37.950
Don't forget your lifelines.

02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:40.040
Be happy, sister.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Count!

02:19:58.290 --> 02:19:59.290
Count!

02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:04.080
This story makes no sense.
We are swimming in delirium.

02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:07.750
My boats, yesterday,
were still in Marseilles. I...

02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:12.120
I'm going to need a...
a deadline to repay it.

02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:14.200
If...

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.450
There's nothing left, Baron.

02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:20.200
Everything that
was yours is mine.

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:24.540
The only thing he has
left are these clothes.

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.080
Leave Paris and maybe
not leave your wife

02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:31.250
and his daughter dies of hunger.

02:20:31.410 --> 02:20:33.040
But anyway, tell me, I...

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.620
Do you think I'm brutal, Baron?

02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:40.540
Not only do I know that,

02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:43.160
but I brag about it.

02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:54.870
Unstable breathing

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.540
You should take your wife home.

02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:01.450
She is very pale.

02:21:10.450 --> 02:21:11.500
And two.

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:55.950
Father!

02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:10.540
By Angèle.

02:22:35.290 --> 02:22:36.250
Get out of the way!

02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:37.620
No!

02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:56.660
For what?

02:22:58.540 --> 02:22:59.540
For what?

02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:11.000
Don't cry.

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:32.330
We knew it would end like this.

02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:34.290
We knew that.

02:24:34.450 --> 02:24:35.410
Haydee!

02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.540
He disobeyed.

02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:45.250
Did you disobey?

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:51.830
What did you disobey?

02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:56.660
It only taught him hate.

02:24:57.370 --> 02:24:59.750
He placed that
dagger in his hand.

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.500
It is your pain that speaks.

02:25:08.330 --> 02:25:09.790
I loved him like a son.

02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:11.160
mocking laughter

02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:14.290
Dark music

02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:18.370
Do you love me too?

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:25.950
Me too, are you ready to
sacrifice me for your revenge?

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.790
It's not revenge.

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:31.750
It's justice.

02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:40.790
Don't forget your tears,
Haydée, Your mother's cry

02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:42.790
and your father's blood.

02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:44.750
And the name of the
person who betrayed them.

02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:47.120
Don't forget his name!

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:19.620
If you love me

02:26:19.790 --> 02:26:22.620
As I love you, don't
try to see me again.

02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:25.250
He's too noble of
heart not to understand.

02:26:25.410 --> 02:26:28.950
I maintain my strength to
fight myself and drink my tears.

02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:32.580
Be happy away from
me, you deserve it.

02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:41.950
Albert?

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:20.580
Albert.

02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:22.950
You are crazy.

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.500
You can't stay.

02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:26.950
Haydée, I've only
known you for a while...

02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:28.500
Leave it.

02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:31.250
Flee from me like one
fleeing from the plague.

02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:34.830
- I'm going to make you unhappy.
 - But run away with me.

02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:37.250
I swear to you, Haydée,

02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:41.250
Instead of despair, This is
the happiness I promise you.

02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:45.910
You don't know me.
The Count doesn't know.

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.000
Haydee...

02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:48.950
If you love me
like I love you...

02:27:52.290 --> 02:27:53.750
Tell me goodbye.

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:56.330
I beg you.

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:00.500
Say!

02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:07.870
So I'll tell you

02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:12.120
attesting to God, who reads
the depths of my heart...

02:28:15.250 --> 02:28:18.830
I wish you a happy
life without my memory.

02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:23.160
Goodbye, my love.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:25.950
This look.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.870
Without you my life is lost.

02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:33.790
My misfortune, right.

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:36.290
What are you going to do?

02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:40.580
But rest assured, I
will keep my promise.

02:28:41.290 --> 02:28:43.290
But please, will you live?

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:45.330
What is important to you?

02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:49.620
In your eyes, I am already dead.

02:28:58.330 --> 02:28:59.580
Let's run away.

02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:13.660
Haydee.

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:16.660
If you want to join
the Morcerf family,

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:18.790
Albert deserves to know

02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:20.080
your story.

02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:25.200
If you remain silent, I will be
forced to speak in your place.

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:28.750
I really need to talk

02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:30.160
in your name?

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:32.540
Tell me, please.

02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:34.160
Haydée is the girl...

02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:35.540
Stop!

02:29:40.290 --> 02:29:41.620
I will speak.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.950
Dark music

02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:03.950
My father was an illustrious
man known as Ali Tebelin.

02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:09.080
Pasha of Janina.

02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:17.950
I was 10 years old

02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:21.000
when he was killed before
my eyes and my mother's.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:24.120
Received a French soldier

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.370
who was our ally.

02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:30.580
Pierced by a dozen bullets,

02:30:32.290 --> 02:30:33.120
my father

02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:35.790
found the strength to stand

02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:39.910
and shot the man who sold it

02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:44.200
gouging out the eye.

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:48.830
I never saw my mother again.

02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:53.500
This officer sold
me into slavery

02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:55.790
to a Vlach tribe in the Balkans.

02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:58.660
- His name was...
 - That's enough.

02:30:58.830 --> 02:30:59.910
Albert.

02:31:05.250 --> 02:31:08.120
- You manipulated me.
 - I warned you.

02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:11.540
- You used me.
 - You may regret your words.

02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:14.750
- Do you think you're scaring me?
 - Don't provoke me.

02:31:14.910 --> 02:31:16.370
Albert, please.

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:17.540
Count!

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:21.790
It took everything away from me.
Except my name, which you dirty.

02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:23.500
No!

02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:26.200
Oh, Count, I beg you.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.080
I consider your glove discarded.

02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:32.080
I'll return it to you rolled
up in a ball tomorrow.

02:31:40.450 --> 02:31:42.080
Aren't you sorry?

02:31:42.250 --> 02:31:44.620
Did they have any
for Edmond Dantès?

02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:47.040
Look at me.

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:51.450
I am nothing more than the
armed arm of deaf and blind fatality.

02:31:56.410 --> 02:31:59.540
Fernand de Morcerf will experience
what my father experienced.

02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:04.290
If you kill Albert,

02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:09.750
you will no longer be able to
say: “God is for me, with me.”

02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:13.580
He will be a killer.

02:32:17.410 --> 02:32:21.250
The Bible says that children
will pay for their parents' crimes.

02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:30.330
Jacopo, follow her.

02:33:06.370 --> 02:33:07.620
He carries his gun.

02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:12.410
Leave us, Jacopo.

02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:15.700
Madam.

02:33:16.450 --> 02:33:17.870
What are you doing here?

02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:20.660
Edmond, you
will not kill my son.

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:23.700
What name did you say?

02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:25.330
Yours.

02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:28.250
Not Madame de Morcerf

02:33:28.410 --> 02:33:30.160
who is in front of
you is Mercédès.

02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:32.500
I don't know anyone
with that name.

02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:37.120
I recognized you as
soon as I saw you.

02:33:38.410 --> 02:33:40.870
And even without seeing you, I
would have recognized your voice.

02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:45.040
My reason was struggling, but my heart
knew. Since then, I have been following him,

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.120
watching him, looking for
what he wants with Morcerf.

02:33:47.290 --> 02:33:49.620
Fernand, I mean, ma'am.

02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:52.750
Since we can remember
our first names.

02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:57.290
I'm to blame.

02:33:59.290 --> 02:34:02.080
It was I who lacked strength
in the face of your absence.

02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:05.790
I was the one who
lacked faith when you died.

02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:09.620
- My!
 - For what?  Why was I alone?

02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:13.250
Why was he absent?
Why was I arrested?

02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:16.160
Why was I presumed dead?

02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:17.700
I don't know.

02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:24.620
I imagine he no longer
writes you love letters,

02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:27.500
but you will easily
recognize your handwriting.

02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:31.660
Then.

02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:34.410
Look, Mercédès.

02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:38.540
This is what your husband wrote

02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:40.660
to Villefort 20 years ago.

02:34:44.370 --> 02:34:48.370
I must take revenge,
Mercédès. It has to be.

02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:52.660
So take revenge, Edmond.

02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.330
But about the culprits.

02:34:58.950 --> 02:35:03.370
Take revenge on Fernand who betrayed
you, take revenge on me, but spare Albert.

02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:10.000
If you knew all the prayers...

02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:16.040
If you knew all
the tears I shed...

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:19.160
Did you lose your
father in solitude?

02:35:19.330 --> 02:35:23.120
Did you see the person you
loved in the arms of your rival?

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.330
- Did you see all this?
- No.

02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:29.500
Yes.

02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:33.750
But I see the man I
never stopped loving

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:36.370
ready to become my son's killer.

02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:52.500
What do you want?

02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:57.950
Do you want your child to live?

02:35:59.250 --> 02:36:00.330
He will live.

02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:05.370
Thanks.

02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.410
Thank you, Edmond.

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:15.660
I will find you again.

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:21.790
How I always dreamed of
you, how I always loved you.

02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:41.200
We must say goodbye.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Goodbye?

02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:48.870
If I give up taking justice
into my own hands,

02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:52.160
I give up what keeps me alive.

02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:57.750
The duel will take
place tomorrow.

02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:01.870
Goodbye, Mercédès.

02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:15.250
Sir Albert de Morcerf,

02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:18.830
publicly provoked the
Count of Monte Cristo.

02:37:19.450 --> 02:37:22.370
The duel will take place at
20 paces, at my command.

02:37:23.370 --> 02:37:24.870
Priority to those offended.

02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:31.580
In position.

02:37:34.290 --> 02:37:35.410
Come on, gentlemen.

02:37:58.370 --> 02:37:59.370
Fire!

02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:27.370
Fire!

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:15.160
I think I see a gleam of
disappointment in your eyes.

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:20.750
I will never forgive
you for taking his life

02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:23.450
and for ripping out my heart.

02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:27.540
So I loved him.

02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:30.120
What if I loved him?

02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.790
Everything made me hate him,
but do we know why we fell in love?

02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:39.830
No matter how much we try to
reason with each other, it's too late.

02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:41.830
We lost our balance.

02:39:44.580 --> 02:39:47.620
There is no more chance

02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:51.750
But instead of hearing this
voice, It's yours that I heard.

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:56.500
I would have caused
his misfortune and mine!

02:39:58.950 --> 02:40:02.660
What am I going to do with
this love I didn't give you?

02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:07.040
Of those words
I didn't tell you?

02:40:09.330 --> 02:40:11.200
You told him.

02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:14.910
And he listened to them.

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.580
Albert...

02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:40.450
Count!

02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:49.370
Run away now.

02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:52.790
Run away and don't let
anyone steal your happiness.

02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:33.450
Edmond!

02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:41.040
Edmond!

02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:48.540
Edmond, show yourself!

02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:55.700
I was waiting for you.

02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:58.870
Finally shows his true face.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.290
I tried to find yours.

02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:04.870
Know who he was.

02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.160
Then I followed
in his footsteps.

02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:10.950
I've been everywhere
you've been.

02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:14.580
I met them all:

02:42:15.410 --> 02:42:18.790
your friends, your brothers in
arms, your enemies, everyone...

02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:21.580
Who hasn't cheated?

02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:24.910
To whom did you remain loyal?

02:42:25.540 --> 02:42:27.830
Everywhere, you
showed your true face.

02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:29.620
I lost

02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:31.200
faith in man,

02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:33.330
the day you betrayed me.

02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:37.000
I should have killed myself.

02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:38.620
It's never too late.

02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:39.790
Get up.

02:47:00.580 --> 02:47:01.830
Look at me.

02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:03.700
Look at me!

02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:06.950
He pants.

02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:07.950
- Kill me.

02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:13.040
We always find
greatness in the dead.

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:15.870
We ended up forgiving them.

02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:23.620
I don't want to be forgiven.

02:48:36.370 --> 02:48:39.660
Mercédès, I came
to say goodbye to you

02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:41.870
where life separated
us from each other,

02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:43.660
21 years ago today.

02:48:44.330 --> 02:48:48.000
So many things have broken
in me and around me since then,

02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:50.200
that the man I knew
no longer exists.

02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:53.080
I promised to
love you until I die

02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:54.910
and still a long time later,

02:48:55.410 --> 02:48:57.120
and I will always love you,

02:48:57.290 --> 02:49:00.200
but it is no longer in my
power to bring you happiness.

02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:03.500
I can only offer you comfort.

02:49:04.450 --> 02:49:06.290
Your child will be happy.

02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:10.410
Albert and Haydée will live
the story we couldn't experience.

02:49:10.580 --> 02:49:12.250
Happiness for our children

02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:15.910
that will survive us and
taste the sweetness of love.

02:49:17.410 --> 02:49:20.200
As I write to you, I am living
my last moments with you.

02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:23.830
Everything afterward
will be just memories.

02:49:24.450 --> 02:49:26.910
I will take them
with me to the sea,

02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:29.750
the only place on earth
where everything is horizon

02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:33.080
and where there are
no traces left by men.

02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:36.620
Live and be happy.

02:49:37.330 --> 02:49:38.410
Never forget,

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:42.000
until the day when providence
perhaps brings us together again,

02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:45.080
that all human wisdom
is in these two words:

02:49:45.660 --> 02:49:46.910
wait for

02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:48.410
and hope.

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:52.120
Edmond Dantes,

02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:54.500
the Count of Monte Cristo.
