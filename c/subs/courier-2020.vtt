01:21.590 --> 01:25.260
The time of the imperialists

01:25.552 --> 01:28.597
will soon come to an end.

01:30.432 --> 01:33.060
They speak...

01:35.145 --> 01:38.983
...speak as if they want
to frighten us.

01:40.943 --> 01:44.363
But they only scare themselves.

01:45.072 --> 01:47.199
They know...

01:47.324 --> 01:50.452
...They know that our nuclear arsenal

01:51.787 --> 01:54.623
is only getting stronger every day.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.211
And I have already said...

02:01.463 --> 02:04.508
And I will say it again,

02:04.591 --> 02:07.469
We... Will...

02:07.802 --> 02:10.389
...bury them!

03:09.490 --> 03:11.492
Daddy, I got my pin.

03:12.242 --> 03:14.244
I'm a Little Octobrist.

03:25.047 --> 03:26.757
Wear it here...

03:27.925 --> 03:29.927
by your heart.

03:48.487 --> 03:50.572
I have to go out for a little while.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.243
I won't wake you.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.579
You can wake me.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.968
I'm an American citizen.

14:39.847 --> 14:43.642
I wish moments like this
were not necessary.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.520
But it seems they are.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.940
As you all know, Major Popov

14:50.024 --> 14:52.568
was caught spying for the Americans.

14:53.527 --> 14:55.237
We must all remember...

14:55.321 --> 14:57.364
...the consequences of treason.

23:20.909 --> 23:22.661
Decadent Westerners.

23:23.871 --> 23:27.166
This is why they are weak.
Eh, comrade Penkovsky?

36:54.306 --> 36:56.517
Mr. Wynne is a guest of my committee.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.185
Let him through.

48:46.268 --> 48:48.103
Chairman Khruschev, so far

48:48.187 --> 48:50.230
Cuba has been more trouble
than it's worth.

48:50.439 --> 48:52.399
It's our one foothold
in Latin America.

48:52.483 --> 48:56.028
But it's too isolated.
We can't expand from there.

48:56.195 --> 48:57.529
It's a weak spot for us.

48:59.740 --> 49:00.908
I agree.

49:00.991 --> 49:02.284
It is now.

49:04.203 --> 49:10.876
But we can turn it into
a weak spot for the Americans.

52:18.522 --> 52:19.606
Colonel?

52:20.524 --> 52:22.318
Sorry, your secretary is away.

52:22.401 --> 52:24.570
Oleg Gribanov, KGB.
Do you have a few minutes?

52:24.987 --> 52:26.530
Of course, come in.

52:29.199 --> 52:31.327
It's an honour to finally meet you.

52:32.119 --> 52:37.041
I know men who served
under you in Kiev.

52:37.666 --> 52:39.835
They say they owe you their lives.

52:40.711 --> 52:42.046
I thought...

52:43.130 --> 52:45.549
...you might remember these
from Ankara.

52:46.675 --> 52:48.927
Contraband, I know, but...

53:20.042 --> 53:21.669
<i>We're curious about...</i>

53:22.211 --> 53:24.129
Greville Wynne.

53:24.838 --> 53:27.633
Have you noticed anything
unorthodox about him?

53:27.716 --> 53:30.302
Behaviour? Interactions?

53:31.971 --> 53:34.223
<i>Nothing of concern.</i>

53:34.974 --> 53:37.434
Or I would have noted it
in my contact reports.

53:38.268 --> 53:40.354
Yes, I read those, very thoroughly.

53:40.896 --> 53:42.690
But now that I tell you
we're looking into him...

53:44.400 --> 53:46.819
...does anything come to mind?

53:48.237 --> 53:50.155
He's been coming to Moscow for awhile.

53:50.864 --> 53:53.200
Why the concern now?

53:53.575 --> 53:56.161
Because he's been coming
to Moscow for awhile.

53:58.664 --> 54:02.710
Meets with many officials,
he goes many places.

54:02.793 --> 54:05.754
Over time, this creates questions.

54:09.633 --> 54:11.051
From what I've seen,

54:11.176 --> 54:13.512
Wynne is interested in making money
and not much else.

54:13.595 --> 54:15.806
But I will be sure...

54:16.557 --> 54:19.393
...to observe him even more closely.

54:22.813 --> 54:24.356
Thank you, Colonel.

54:24.857 --> 54:26.942
I won't take any more of your time.

54:27.484 --> 54:28.861
Thank you for warning me.

54:30.362 --> 54:31.822
I'll leave you the cigarettes...

54:37.453 --> 54:39.038
...and send you a whole carton.

58:44.283 --> 58:45.951
How are you feeling?

58:46.076 --> 58:48.287
Much better.

58:48.370 --> 58:51.582
She says I've been working too hard.

58:51.665 --> 58:54.001
My body decided to give itself
a little vacation.

58:54.251 --> 58:57.046
I want to keep him here a few days

58:57.129 --> 58:58.881
to rest.

58:58.964 --> 59:00.883
Then he should be back to normal.

59:01.050 --> 59:02.343
Thank you.

59:06.430 --> 59:07.973
Nina...

59:09.058 --> 59:11.727
...can I talk with your father alone?

59:18.859 --> 59:22.905
Really, I feel fine.

59:24.073 --> 59:26.825
I couldn't wait to tell you...

59:27.868 --> 59:29.036
What?

59:31.830 --> 59:33.332
I'm pregnant.

59:44.343 --> 59:46.595
This one feels like a boy.

1:00:52.953 --> 1:00:54.496
Excuse me, Colonel?

1:00:54.747 --> 1:00:57.666
I'm Irina from the Trade Ministry.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.421
I wanted to speak to you
about the London trade fair.

1:01:02.713 --> 1:01:05.591
Yes, our preparations
are going very well.

1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:09.595
The minister has decided you
do not need to attend.

1:01:11.930 --> 1:01:13.682
Oh. Are we not sending a delegation?

1:01:14.892 --> 1:01:16.101
We are...

1:01:16.185 --> 1:01:18.228
but the Minister feels
your other work is too

1:01:18.312 --> 1:01:19.730
...valuable to neglect right now.

1:01:20.064 --> 1:01:21.690
He would like you to remain in Moscow.

1:01:21.857 --> 1:01:23.275
Of course.

1:01:23.859 --> 1:01:26.278
Please tell the Minister
I won't let him down.

1:12:23.435 --> 1:12:25.562
I have a light day.

1:12:25.646 --> 1:12:27.147
I'll come home after lunch.

1:12:30.442 --> 1:12:31.777
We...

1:12:32.069 --> 1:12:33.988
...can do something fun,
would you like that?

1:12:35.155 --> 1:12:36.240
Yes, Daddy.

1:12:36.907 --> 1:12:39.034
And you could wear
that red dress for me?

1:15:52.853 --> 1:15:54.688
We need to leave.

1:16:11.121 --> 1:16:13.040
I have diplomatic status.

1:16:21.548 --> 1:16:23.050
Have a seat, Colonel.

1:16:34.770 --> 1:16:36.689
Oleg, what's happening?

1:16:38.065 --> 1:16:39.233
Tell her.

1:16:39.316 --> 1:16:41.151
She didn't know anything,
you can see that.

1:16:41.235 --> 1:16:43.070
Tell your family why we're here.

1:16:51.203 --> 1:16:52.246
I am...

1:16:52.329 --> 1:16:53.664
I am a traitor.

1:16:54.206 --> 1:16:55.958
I betrayed the revolution.

1:17:02.297 --> 1:17:03.882
I'm so sorry.

1:17:09.388 --> 1:17:10.889
I believed in you for so long.

1:17:11.807 --> 1:17:13.434
I defended you around the Kremlin.

1:17:14.184 --> 1:17:15.561
And now this.

1:17:16.562 --> 1:17:17.646
How long have you known?

1:17:18.147 --> 1:17:19.898
Not until I had you poisoned.

1:17:21.442 --> 1:17:23.110
While you were in hospital,

1:17:23.193 --> 1:17:25.529
we did a search and found
your hiding place.

1:17:26.155 --> 1:17:27.990
Installed surveillance.

1:17:28.615 --> 1:17:30.492
We saw your plans last night,

1:17:31.410 --> 1:17:34.079
and came in this morning
for a closer look.

1:17:35.289 --> 1:17:37.166
And now the game is over.

1:17:38.667 --> 1:17:40.669
I swear my family did not know.

1:17:41.003 --> 1:17:43.130
We will discuss your family later.

1:17:44.631 --> 1:17:46.050
It's time to go.
