01:01.103 --> 01:02.021
You know, right?

01:02.021 --> 01:08.027
I'm glad you're back,
but, uh, once you're in, you're in.

01:08.027 --> 01:08.944
I'm in.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.324
<i>Got something for you.</i>

01:18.037 --> 01:21.081
"The reasonable man
adapts himself to the world,

01:22.416 --> 01:27.922
the unreasonable one persists
in trying to adapt the world to himself.

01:28.964 --> 01:34.345
Therefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man."

01:38.015 --> 01:40.768
This is it. No way out this time.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.936
I trust you, Kevin.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.606
I better, I'm putting my whole life
in your hands.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.707
-  How was Tokyo?
- Crowded.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.837
-  Anything to declare?
-  I wish.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.715
- Welcome to New York, Mr. Cairns.
- Thank you very much.

02:14.844 --> 02:15.678
Thank you.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.763
Good morning, sir.

03:42.222 --> 03:48.228
I left my, um, suitcase in the museum
last Thursday on one of the lower floors.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.481
That's not cool. What's it look like, man?

03:50.481 --> 03:53.692
It's, um, like a medium metallic spinner.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.986
Hang on.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.323
- Ah, this it?
- That's it.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.576
You don't want to know how I lost it.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.331
- Good to go.
- All right, thank you very much.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.626
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.070
Good morning.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.992
So, I will just need your ID
and a credit card, for instance.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.203
Would you like the real one
or the fake one?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.622
The real one, please. Thank you.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.635
- And that's yours. Have a nice day.
- Thank you very much.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.983
"Nearly all men can stand adversity,

05:57.983 --> 06:00.486
but if you want to test
a man's character..."

06:56.166 --> 06:58.168
<i>Are we clear? Proceed with drop-off?</i>

06:58.168 --> 07:01.296
<i>We're en route. Please stand by.</i>

07:13.308 --> 07:15.269
What am I paying you fucking morons for?

07:16.728 --> 07:20.190
You know the number on the container.
Now go and find it, and find it now.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.465
And a sincere happy birthday, my man.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.466
Thank you. Wow.

07:46.466 --> 07:53.348
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

07:53.348 --> 07:59.897
<i>♪ Happy birthday to Papa
Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

07:59.897 --> 08:01.648
Hip-hip, hooray

08:04.610 --> 08:06.403
Go on, we'll get to that.

08:06.403 --> 08:07.905
<i>I am so sorry, Monica.</i>

08:08.906 --> 08:10.532
Meeting me is why you're here,

08:12.326 --> 08:15.662
not out there living your life somewhere.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.207
I'm sorry.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.127
I wish you were here.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.386
You see that girl at the end of the bar?

09:14.263 --> 09:15.514
Yes, sir.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.519
Buy her a drink, and tell her
I said thanks, but no thanks.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.479
Understood, sir.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.266
What the hell?

13:09.372 --> 13:10.415
Who are you?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.149
Why me?

14:16.565 --> 14:18.483
Ow!

15:15.415 --> 15:16.249
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

15:23.548 --> 15:25.467
- Welcome to Italy, Mr. Sites.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

16:57.142 --> 16:58.727
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>
-  <i>Buongiorno.</i>

16:58.727 --> 17:01.396
- Did you guys steal my suitcase?
- Uh, what color is it?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.398
- Black.
- Yeah, I think we have something.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.315
Thank you.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.362
May I see your passport?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.824
Right, right. Perfecto.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.243
Gotta put a leash on that thing.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.662
- There you go, Mr. Sites.
- Thank you.

17:37.307 --> 17:41.227
"I cannot think,
but we have much to be thankful for

17:42.854 --> 17:47.817
and more still to hope for in the future."

20:12.921 --> 20:14.255
I know who you are.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.175
- I know what you're doing.
- And what's that?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.887
You flew here earlier today.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.640
Got your instructions
from a local newspaper.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.976
You picked up a bag at lost and found.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.770
Same as you always do,
same as in New York.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.648
Inside was this gun, picture of the person
you're supposed to kill.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.024
Sound about right so far?

20:34.484 --> 20:37.862
Look, my name is Kacey
and you're Shaw, right?

20:37.862 --> 20:39.322
Evan Shaw?

20:39.322 --> 20:43.159
I have a story for you and you're not
gonna believe it, but I have proof.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.828
Everything I've learned about you
and The Division you work for

20:45.828 --> 20:47.497
is in a file there on the desk.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.671
What file?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.015
You wanna dance?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.399
-  Who do you work for?
- MI6.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.693
I was sent here to investigate
the U.S. Tourism Division,

21:16.693 --> 21:19.988
supposedly a branch of the CIA
that sends you to kill people.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.781
Only it doesn't exist.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.658
Yeah, black ops is funny like that.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.535
No, I mean, it really doesn't exist

21:25.535 --> 21:29.497
as in it never existed,
as in you've never worked for the CIA.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.960
The Division, as you know it, was created
and run by Kevin Angler for someone,

21:33.960 --> 21:37.714
we don't know who, but it was shut down
10 years ago when he died.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.674
What are you talking about,
Angler isn't dead.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.011
Can you prove that?
'Cause I can prove he is, check the file.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.309
- Wait, wait, I have proof.
- Quiet.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.687
Listen, I'm not an officer, I'm not.

21:52.687 --> 21:54.814
I'm just an analyst. Just an analyst.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.859
Wait, wait. This case was open for years.

21:57.859 --> 22:01.779
It was opened by Monica Walker.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.364
What did you just say?

22:05.867 --> 22:07.910
<i>Monica Walker. MI6.</i>

22:07.910 --> 22:10.329
She was an analyst like me,
before my time.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.959
Monica Walker is dead.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.380
I know.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.930
Put that in your mouth, all the way.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.476
You sit tight.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.693
-  <i>Buona sera.
- Buona sera.</i>

22:41.319 --> 22:42.987
Do you have a computer I can use.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.838
<i>Well, I have been married, right?</i>

23:00.838 --> 23:02.882
<i>But it didn't work.</i>

23:02.882 --> 23:05.218
<i>Not in this life. It doesn't work.</i>

23:05.218 --> 23:06.552
For me anyway.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.805
I mean, it's my fault probably,
I would say.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.224
I don't see how it can work.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.560
- I mean, with this lifestyle.
-  No. Uh-uh.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.397
- But I met a really great woman.
- There it is.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.150
- Huh? I mean, really great.
- All right.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.694
I've never felt like this.

23:24.529 --> 23:27.949
I've never thought about having a family
or a normal life or settling down,

23:27.949 --> 23:30.493
having a kid, you know, until I met her,

23:30.493 --> 23:33.830
and then I thought, "Well, hey,
maybe that's not such a bad idea."

23:34.705 --> 23:36.249
- Anyone I know?
- No.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.668
- No?
- Nah, I've actually known her a long time.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.961
I met her in Syria.

23:39.961 --> 23:43.131
<i>Okay. There you go, Monica.</i>
-  <i>Yeah. Monica, it's Monica. Yeah.</i>

23:43.923 --> 23:45.550
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

23:45.550 --> 23:50.596
No, I mean, look, dude, I'm a soldier.
I've never-- I'm not used to this.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.643
I wish you luck, really, I do,
I wish you luck.

23:55.643 --> 23:59.355
But, um, you know, I'm gonna miss you.

23:59.355 --> 24:04.443
I mean, you keep your friends close
in this job, that's for sure.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.361
But...

24:07.655 --> 24:08.489
Monica.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.992
- Monica?
- Monica.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.872
- We'll see.
- We'll see.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.508
Hi.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.803
I told you to sit tight.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.766
I've been doing this
I don't know how many years,

24:35.766 --> 24:38.644
and you're telling me, all this time
I've been doing it for someone else.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.105
- For someone that you don't know, yes.
- For who?

24:42.356 --> 24:43.524
MI6?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.862
- Where's your team?
- Oh, I'm on my own.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.823
No, MI6 didn't even think
I'd make it this far.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.075
They want me to go back to London
and give a full report.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.370
But if I do that, whoever's actually
behind this might get away.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.122
How do you know
I'm not the one behind this?

24:58.122 --> 25:02.001
You're not. You're not.
I know everything about you.

25:02.001 --> 25:05.379
- You didn't even know Angler was dead.
- I still don't know Angler's dead.

25:14.722 --> 25:15.556
Oh.

25:16.849 --> 25:17.808
Oh, thank you.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.561
Sorry about that.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.524
Look, believe me,

25:26.442 --> 25:28.194
I know what it's like to be alone.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.614
Nothing but loyalty
to what you believe in.

25:31.614 --> 25:32.823
I get it.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.994
But I'm here because someone
is using you to hurt other people,

25:36.994 --> 25:38.621
and I wanna try and stop that.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.456
But I need help.

25:41.666 --> 25:42.541
Your help.

25:47.755 --> 25:53.803
Look, I am on a 10:00 a.m. flight to Malta
in the morning.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.473
And you can either stay here
and follow orders

25:57.473 --> 26:00.101
and kill whoever the person is
in that file in your safe,

26:00.977 --> 26:05.356
or you can come with me,
try and figure out the truth.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.985
And I totally, by the way, understand

26:08.985 --> 26:13.197
if, you know, you need some time
to think on it, sleep on it.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.366
Uh, if you want in the morning,
we can meet up.

26:15.366 --> 26:19.996
There's a really great little coffee shop
down the corner.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.248
I always think better after a cappuccino.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.084
Mm-hm.
Or I could lock you in the bathroom.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.545
What? Come on. Really?

26:27.545 --> 26:29.422
This is getting ridiculous.

26:29.422 --> 26:32.633
Hey, you fucker,
you can't just lock me in here.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.802
Quiet, people are trying to sleep.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.805
Can I at least get a blanket?

26:37.805 --> 26:39.890
Use a towel. They're Egyptian cotton.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.351
Those don't even exist.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.850
<i>I mean, you say
you still don't know Angler is dead,</i>

27:22.850 --> 27:24.810
<i>but you know Monica is.</i>

27:25.353 --> 27:26.896
<i>Do you really know how though?</i>

27:27.772 --> 27:30.608
<i>What if it wasn't
actually just an accident.</i>

27:58.844 --> 28:02.473
- What? Does this mean...?
- We're going to Malta? Yes.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.568
Can you, uh, wait up, please?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.407
Very fast walker.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.158
Sorry.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.578
<i>If we're gonna do this,
we do it my way.</i>

28:25.287 --> 28:27.081
<i>Which means you do what I say
when I say it.</i>

28:27.081 --> 28:29.667
<i>- Is that understood?</i>
-  <i>Yeah, of course, not a problem.</i>

28:33.838 --> 28:35.339
You got anything important in this?

28:35.339 --> 28:38.092
Uh, just basically everything that I own.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.845
- What?
- Rule number one.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.306
We move fast and travel light.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.351
Well, can I at least keep my purse?
Because I have my mouth guard in here.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.727
- I grind my teeth and--
- For now.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.147
Thank you.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.523
And just so we're clear,

28:53.774 --> 28:56.694
if the thought even crosses my mind
that you're playing me,

28:57.153 --> 28:59.822
I'll slit your throat
and leave you on the side of the road.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.036
That's very graphic.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.486
This is Liona at corporate.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.280
Our consultant has just gone off mission.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.992
It's clear he doesn't know about
the hidden body GPS that's tracking him.

29:46.202 --> 29:49.288
Judging by the map, it looks like
he's on a boat of some kind.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.166
<i>I need you to place an ad
in Malta's biggest newspaper immediately.</i>

29:52.166 --> 29:53.209
Yes, sir.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.544
<i>Run it as long as it takes to get a reply.</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:57.087
I'm ready for the copy, sir.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.341
<i>I don't understand why we didn't just lie.</i>

30:00.341 --> 30:03.219
I mean, I already had the tickets.
We could have been there by now.

30:04.261 --> 30:08.015
Whenever there's a choice,
always choose something with an exit.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.769
Oh, is that rule number two?
Do ferries have exits?

30:12.436 --> 30:13.562
Yeah, they do.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.399
You know, you're really not
what I expected.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.901
I thought after all this time alone,

30:18.901 --> 30:21.403
you'd at least be looking
for someone to talk to.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.448
No, I'm pretty comfortable
with not talking.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.203
Aren't you at least curious
as to how I found you?

30:32.206 --> 30:33.374
Not at all.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.879
I was recruited by MI6
right out of university.

30:38.879 --> 30:42.424
One day I was given the open case file
to the U.S. Tourism Division.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.843
Now, it sounded official,
but had nothing to show for itself.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.637
So, color my interest piqued.

30:46.637 --> 30:49.390
I managed to liberate
some classified reports

30:49.390 --> 30:51.308
and they all showed one organization

30:51.308 --> 30:54.645
entirely devoted to the support
of one field operative.

30:54.645 --> 30:58.107
And wherever he went,
a high-profile murder occurred.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.943
And who was that?

31:02.278 --> 31:05.573
No, you fit the age
and other parameters.

31:05.573 --> 31:09.201
So the closer I looked, the more you
seemed like the ghost I was tracking.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.663
But I didn't know your name,
just your face, your habits.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.873
And once I was able
to establish a pattern,

31:15.749 --> 31:18.252
actually became pretty easy to find you.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.046
No one ever did
because no one was ever looking,

31:21.046 --> 31:22.131
until me.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.261
So what's this lead we're following?

31:27.261 --> 31:29.013
Well, The Division has offices all over

31:29.013 --> 31:31.682
and they're still there,
but most of them have never been used.

31:32.308 --> 31:35.269
But there's one in Malta that has been,
it's abandoned now though.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.696
No one's ever found me

31:47.406 --> 31:48.407
and lived.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.554
All right.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.681
We're not together.

32:13.515 --> 32:14.933
No eye contact with anyone.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.644
Lean away from security cameras.

32:16.644 --> 32:19.813
Yeah, I know how to walk through
a secure location, thank you.

32:20.648 --> 32:21.482
Yeah.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.361
Thank you.

32:34.995 --> 32:38.707
I, uh, have to use the little girl's room.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.044
Of course you do.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.537
<i>Why are you in Malta?
Your assignment's in Rome.</i>

33:17.371 --> 33:19.039
I wanna know who I'm working for.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.500
<i>Why? Nothing's changed.</i>

33:22.209 --> 33:25.754
What you mean, nothing's changed?
Angler's dead. That's changed.

33:27.923 --> 33:28.924
Who is this?

33:29.758 --> 33:31.385
<i>Return to Rome, finish the mission.</i>

33:32.970 --> 33:34.888
Maybe I'll come find you instead.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.934
<i>Finish the mission
or you'll become the mission.</i>

33:38.934 --> 33:39.935
<i>Do you understand?</i>

33:55.159 --> 33:56.744
- So, what did I miss?
- All done?

33:57.661 --> 33:58.495
Okay.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.172
- This is Butler.
-  <i>He's on his way to Malta.</i>

34:08.172 --> 34:09.840
<i>I'll send you his body GPS.</i>

34:13.635 --> 34:16.054
Gentlemen. Showtime.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.683
-  Fucking go.
-  Move!

35:00.557 --> 35:01.767
You've been here before?

35:04.895 --> 35:05.729
Sir?

35:06.396 --> 35:07.564
Can I help you with something?

35:07.564 --> 35:11.985
Yes, I'm, uh,
looking for the U.S. Tourism Division.

35:12.820 --> 35:13.946
This is Malta.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.323
Why would there be
a U.S. Tourism Division here?

35:16.865 --> 35:19.409
I go where the road takes me.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.704
I go where the road takes me.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.793
Right this way. He's been expecting you.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.169
You've been here before?

35:30.671 --> 35:32.256
Yeah, once or twice.

35:38.387 --> 35:40.514
Hey, sir, you have a guest.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.229
Kev.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.189
Hi.

36:51.293 --> 36:54.630
So if this was the CIA, why didn't they
set it up at the American Embassy?

36:54.630 --> 36:55.964
Non-official cover.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.675
Angler hated any kind of oversight.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.996
You, the elevator.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.681
This is where Angler and I
had the meetings.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.151
Uh, you know, fun fact, actually.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.446
Spiral staircases were
actually created for firehouses

38:01.446 --> 38:04.408
back when firemen still rode horses.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.540
'Cause horses can't walk in circles.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.961
So they couldn't get, you know...
stairs at night.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.496
Look at that.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.873
What is it?

38:56.710 --> 38:58.086
Ever seen one these before?

38:59.421 --> 39:02.340
No. Yeah, I know what a cassette is.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.409
Contact, number four.

39:31.078 --> 39:32.245
Come on.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.625
I know where he's going.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.419
Back to the house. Back to the house.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.346
Come on, Kacey.

39:55.102 --> 39:58.063
Let's try to the right.
GPS is not accurate enough.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.572
Back to the house.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.427
Access to the roof. Move it!

40:38.979 --> 40:40.105
Come on, Kacey.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.282
We're outside.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.121
Come on, Kacey. Come on.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.081
Come on.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.469
Come on, Kacey.

42:12.489 --> 42:15.659
Don't tell me you lost them, again.

42:20.914 --> 42:21.915
Cathedral.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.084
On me.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.128
Come on, Kacey.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.262
Move, move!

42:35.262 --> 42:36.846
Go, Kacey, go. Come on.

42:57.492 --> 42:58.868
Come on. All right, go on.

43:02.372 --> 43:04.749
-  Move, move!
-  Go, go, go, go.

43:04.749 --> 43:05.792
Let's go.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.586
To the right, go, go, go.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.220
Do you know where we are going?

43:18.013 --> 43:19.014
Come on.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.741
Everybody out! Now!

43:51.713 --> 43:53.840
Come on. All right, come on.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.594
Shit

43:58.720 --> 43:59.554
Anyone?

44:04.851 --> 44:06.061
Satellite's lost them.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.736
Who the hell were those people?
The Maltese police?

44:14.736 --> 44:16.279
Those weren't police officers.

44:16.279 --> 44:19.032
- How do you know?
- No badges, or unit numbers.

44:19.032 --> 44:20.325
No police cars.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.911
-  <i>So then who were they?</i>
-  <i>Mercenaries.</i>

44:22.911 --> 44:25.497
<i>See, I told you
I was onto something with this.</i>

44:25.497 --> 44:29.292
Why else would mercenaries respond to
a break-in at a defunct government office?

44:29.292 --> 44:31.628
- Somebody hired them.
- Exactly, but who?

44:35.131 --> 44:37.967
Back to base.
Getting away from the authorities.

44:38.885 --> 44:41.262
And we need to reprogram our target's GPS.

44:50.105 --> 44:52.107
-  So, what are we looking for?
-  A car.

44:55.402 --> 44:59.656
We're gonna need a place to stay,
for tonight at least.

44:59.656 --> 45:02.617
Well, MI6 has a safe house
here in Malta we can use.

45:09.707 --> 45:10.708
Bingo.

45:22.971 --> 45:24.013
This car suits you.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.474
Old and slow.

45:41.406 --> 45:45.785
So, uh, yeah, the house
is just a little bit down this road.

45:45.785 --> 45:46.870
All right.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.413
Anybody in there?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.042
Okay.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.670
Don't ever get too comfortable.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.757
And always make sure
wherever you stay is safe.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.760
You must be a really big hit
at parties, huh?

46:43.760 --> 46:45.094
I don't go to parties.

46:47.096 --> 46:48.598
That's a shocker.

47:10.620 --> 47:11.829
All right, we got power.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.843
<i>Kevin, did you really
think you'd get away with this forever?</i>

47:25.843 --> 47:28.513
<i>Yeah, Sean,
I kind of thought I might, yeah.</i>

47:29.097 --> 47:30.223
That's Angler.

47:30.807 --> 47:33.226
<i>We never resort to killing.
Your military days are over.</i>

47:33.226 --> 47:36.229
But the first voice is Irish. Who's Sean?

47:37.063 --> 47:39.649
<i>You know I can still
make a difference here.</i>

47:39.649 --> 47:42.694
<i>- I'll find new funding and--</i>
-  <i>Kevin, you're not listening.</i>

47:42.694 --> 47:45.363
<i>You went rogue.
That's it, you're done, you're out.</i>

47:45.363 --> 47:46.447
<i>It's over.</i>

47:46.447 --> 47:48.950
<i>The Division is a success, right?</i>

47:49.576 --> 47:53.079
<i>You think you can play God, Kevin?
The CIA has government rules.</i>

47:53.079 --> 47:56.291
<i>You're way out of line here.
You're not getting away with this.</i>

47:57.083 --> 47:58.960
<i>Sean, are you threatening me,
sweetheart?</i>

47:58.960 --> 48:01.629
<i>You went rogue on us.
That's it, you're out, it's over.</i>

48:08.720 --> 48:09.637
You okay?

48:11.347 --> 48:13.558
I don't buy it. Any of it.

48:14.434 --> 48:17.645
Did Angler sound like he was about
to retire on that tape to you?

48:19.022 --> 48:20.481
No, he didn't.

48:20.481 --> 48:25.653
But there's all kinds of things online
if you know where to look for them.

48:31.159 --> 48:36.122
I had to gather as much or more
information on other people.

48:37.832 --> 48:39.834
Angler had no family, so...

48:39.834 --> 48:43.588
What do you mean, he didn't have a family?
He told me once he had a family.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.548
<i>No, not that I found.</i>

48:45.548 --> 48:49.010
That's why the state took over his burial
and sale of his estate.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.311
None of that makes any sense.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.233
Were you and Angler friends?

49:04.233 --> 49:05.568
Oh, I don't know.

49:05.568 --> 49:07.779
I don't know
what that means anymore, friends.

49:07.779 --> 49:09.072
<i>Kevin.</i>

49:09.072 --> 49:11.532
- Kevin, Kevin.
-  Wait, wait, wait, I'm on...

49:11.532 --> 49:15.453
We were brothers in arms.

49:19.123 --> 49:22.460
So you gave up any chance of having
a real life just for this mission?

49:26.673 --> 49:28.132
I was serving my country.

49:31.511 --> 49:35.223
You know, there are other ways
to serve your country

49:35.223 --> 49:38.476
that don't involve you
being alone forever.

49:40.395 --> 49:43.815
<i>Maybe this is a wakeup call of sorts.</i>

49:56.035 --> 49:56.869
Yeah.

49:57.745 --> 50:01.207
I gotta figure out who this Sean guy is,
and the council he's talking about.

50:04.252 --> 50:05.503
Let's get some rest.

50:06.421 --> 50:08.589
- I'll take the couch.
- Okay.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.301
If you get cold, there's some towels.

50:12.301 --> 50:14.554
I don't know
if they're Egyptian cotton or not, but...

50:15.722 --> 50:18.433
- You just couldn't help yourself.
- No, I couldn't.

50:21.978 --> 50:23.229
Night.

50:26.399 --> 50:28.568
- Night, Shaw.
- Goodnight.

50:33.156 --> 50:34.657
Only got two mags left.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.374
- There you go.
- Thank you.

50:48.004 --> 50:49.839
Oh, I was married once, right?

50:52.091 --> 50:53.509
I mean, it didn't work.

50:54.177 --> 50:55.553
I mean, mostly my fault.

50:56.137 --> 50:58.222
Actually, it was all my fault.
But, no, it didn't work.

50:58.931 --> 51:01.517
I'm just a soldier.
I don't know about this stuff.

51:01.517 --> 51:03.227
- It's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.

51:03.227 --> 51:06.731
It's not embarrassing. I wish you luck.
I really do, I wish you luck.

51:07.899 --> 51:09.650
I mean, I'm gonna miss you though.

51:11.652 --> 51:15.615
I mean, in this business, what we do,
you keep your friends close, right?

51:17.408 --> 51:20.453
<i>- Yeah.</i>
-  <i>So that's it, that's your advice?</i>

51:22.872 --> 51:24.081
Yeah.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.958
Yeah.

51:28.211 --> 51:29.545
"Broken wings.

51:34.550 --> 51:35.510
Rise anew."

51:42.767 --> 51:45.937
<i>Is there any more details
on who the fuck this guy is?</i>

51:47.230 --> 51:49.148
<i>He slipped away like a pro,
and you know it.</i>

51:50.441 --> 51:52.610
There's something off about this guy.

51:53.945 --> 51:57.323
Bastard's smart.
He's somewhere in a GPS dead zone.

51:58.574 --> 51:59.826
I'll find him.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.842
- Good morning.
- Morning.

52:20.137 --> 52:20.972
Wait, is that--

52:22.723 --> 52:24.851
Water supply pipe from the ice machine?

52:25.560 --> 52:26.561
No.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.187
Okay.

52:33.568 --> 52:34.402
Works.

53:01.554 --> 53:05.516
I'll get us some breakfast.
Be ready to work when I get back.

53:06.225 --> 53:07.602
Aye-aye, captain.

53:09.186 --> 53:13.190
Rule number five,
action beats reaction every time.

54:06.327 --> 54:07.620
- Everything all right?
- Excuse me.

54:07.620 --> 54:10.289
This is kind of an emergency,
but do you have a telephone I can use?

54:10.289 --> 54:12.333
Sure, we've got one behind the counter
you can use.

54:12.333 --> 54:13.250
Thank you.

54:33.562 --> 54:34.981
<i>Find what you're looking for?</i>

54:34.981 --> 54:38.359
Not yet, but I'm getting closer.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.112
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

54:41.696 --> 54:43.823
<i>Return to Rome and complete your mission.</i>

54:44.699 --> 54:45.741
Why?

54:45.741 --> 54:48.577
The Division is gone.
I saw it with my own eyes.

54:48.577 --> 54:50.037
<i>You saw an empty office.</i>

54:50.663 --> 54:53.708
<i>- What does that prove?</i>
- That the girl may be right after all.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.377
<i>The girl is not who you think she is.</i>

54:57.211 --> 54:58.045
Really?

54:59.422 --> 55:01.382
I suppose you want me to kill her then?

55:02.008 --> 55:04.385
<i>She's already dead. So are you.</i>

55:40.713 --> 55:41.839
Move, move!

56:39.772 --> 56:42.149
He's behind us. Turn around.

58:01.937 --> 58:04.273
He's not fucking here. He's gone.

58:04.940 --> 58:07.026
- He's not here.
- He must be close.

58:08.068 --> 58:09.153
Follow my lead.

58:12.198 --> 58:13.365
GPS is blocked again.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.744
I know of an MI6 safe house close by.

58:17.369 --> 58:19.747
Kacey! Kacey.

58:19.747 --> 58:21.290
- Kacey.
- What? Hi.

58:21.290 --> 58:22.750
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.089
Move.

58:43.687 --> 58:44.772
Light it up.

59:05.668 --> 59:07.294
Alfonse, move in.

59:28.983 --> 59:30.609
Get the fuck off.

59:33.696 --> 59:34.571
Right on time.

59:36.198 --> 59:37.449
Fuck you going?

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.110
Come on. Let's go.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:28.542
-  <i>Are you hurt?</i>
-  <i>No, are you?</i>

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:30.419
<i>I'm good.</i>

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:39.553
<i>iPad's gone.</i>

01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:41.680
<i>We need a new approach.</i>

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:44.641
<i>We're losing too many men.</i>

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:47.603
That's the job.

01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:50.564
We knew it going into this.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.233
He says he's American?

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.526
He didn't.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.865
I think we're taking out one of our own.

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:07.122
I don't care if he's got a Medal of Honor.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.167
He's dead.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.349
Are you okay?

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.612
What are you doing?

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.365
You're not MI6, are you?

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.785
- What?
- That wasn't a safe house.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:47.746
There's no weapons, no safety protocols.
You already had your laptop there.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.373
Stop lying to me.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:50.958
- Stop lying to me.
- No, no.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:53.085
That was a safe house.

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:56.255
It just hasn't been used in years,
like I told you last night.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:58.757
And I am MI6.

01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:01.343
Well, I used to be.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:04.680
Wait, if you knew then why did you
even bother coming back for me?

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.558
I don't want questions.
I want answers. Who are you?

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.896
Talk or I disappear.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.023
Who sent you?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.284
Monica Walker was my mother.

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:30.456
She died years ago in a car accident.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:36.253
And I never met my father until yesterday.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:46.889
Bullshit.

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:48.682
She never told you.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.144
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Tell me the truth. Who sent you?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.606
Look.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:57.608
My birthmark.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.360
<i>Look familiar to you?</i>

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:03.780
It's the same one you have.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.118
She called you Evander, your real name.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.706
The Arcadian wise man in Greek mythology.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.042
She said that you hated it.

01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:20.380
I'm telling you the truth.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.007
What month you were born?

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.259
April.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.054
What color was her hair?

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:29.681
<i>Brown.</i>

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:46.782
Infinity.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.994
Love is infinite.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.180
Where are all the chairs?

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:55.601
Come join me.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.104
-  Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:05:01.023 --> 01:05:04.985
- What's your name?
- Monica, what's yours?

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.239
I can't tell you, I'd have to kill you.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:12.576
<i>Dangerous man.</i>

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:15.454
Thanks for saving me.

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:18.582
Happy to help.

01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:24.588
Hi.

01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:30.385
A social worker...

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.474
gave me this when I was a teenager.

01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:36.683
It's my mom's diary.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:41.813
In it she wrote about
being pregnant when you left.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.734
She also wrote about
trying to contact you.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.948
She was blocked by red tape
and outright lies at every turn.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.991
I never knew.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.285
I never knew.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.454
None.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.290
I was buried in work in Seoul

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.169
and that's when I was approached
by the CIA, by Angler.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.672
After that, it was...

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.133
a whole different life.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.846
Um, were you working for Angler
when you were with my mom?

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:19.267
No.

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:23.021
- I met a really great woman.
-  Monica.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.691
- Monica?
- Monica.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:37.285
How'd you meet her?

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.211
I broke my rules.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.096
I fell in love with her...

01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:59.933
the second I saw her.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:03.687
She stopped my heart.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:12.487
How long were you two together?

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:20.996
Come on, I mean, you know, it's only
natural that I would wanna talk about it.

01:07:20.996 --> 01:07:22.706
I mean, you're my dad, you know?

01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:27.461
Not long enough.

01:07:29.588 --> 01:07:31.339
Saying goodbye to her was, uh...

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.304
one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life.

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:43.351
Then why'd you do it?

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.065
Because I'm a good little soldier.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:01.953
So that was it? You just never--
You never thought about her again or...?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.335
Yeah, I thought about her.

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:11.004
I flew to London.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.715
- To see my mom?
- Yes.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:19.304
We hadn't spoken in a few years
and I couldn't get her out of my mind.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:20.347
So I thought...

01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:24.893
if anybody could change my mind,
it was your mother.

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.813
She had a way of doing that, you know?

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.440
She's...

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.319
I was a few hours too late.

01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:40.033
I always wondered,

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:44.287
you know, if I'd gotten there a day early.

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:53.421
Life is cruel.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:59.553
Let's get some rest, set up,
we got a lot of work to do.

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.640
Yeah, I know.
I know somewhere that we can go.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.060
Let's go rest up.

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:51.396
What are you doing?

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:57.193
What is this?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.701
It's where I do my work.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.956
I decode the ads.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:14.127
Is it hard to decode them?

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:18.924
No, every code has a key.

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:22.177
Once you know what it is, it's easy.

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:30.602
I mean, the pictures,
the drawings, they're beautiful.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:31.645
Did you draw them?

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.230
Yeah.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.568
No one's ever seen those before.

01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:42.447
What do they mean?

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.493
Registry of every...

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.287
kill that I've done.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.208
Of everyone I've ever...

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.004
retired.

01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:07.430
What's your key?
Just so I can read them.

01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:09.057
I don't know,

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:11.518
I think that they might help us
find what we're looking for.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.112
Everything's one character off.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:27.325
It alternates
between forwards and backwards.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.627
Do you mind if I keep this for tonight,
just to study it?

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:43.008
All right.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:46.761
Thanks.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.019
You up all night?

01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:39.564
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:43.068
Look, I mean,
this is before The Division closed.

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:45.695
All of your jobs were for terrorists,

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.656
dictators, African warlords,
all bad guys, right?

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.034
Then after The Division closed,
it changed.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:53.953
It was scientists, CEOs, politicians.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:58.083
Yes, some were bad guys, but there were
also some others as well, right?

01:12:58.083 --> 01:13:01.377
CEOs and scientists aren't bad guys?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:06.841
Okay, true, but you can't deny
there was a change, right?

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:10.970
And this is only like
a couple of hours of work.

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:13.765
You know, there's a library
not too far from here.

01:13:13.765 --> 01:13:15.350
Do you think it's safe?

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:17.936
It's right in here.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.456
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:44.129
Meet His Excellency, Sean Davis
of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:45.880
Or should I say "meet again,"

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.842
'cause, you know,
you killed him the first time.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:51.052
"The Knights of Malta."

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:55.431
The Sub-Priory of Ballygowan in Ireland.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.018
So this is the guy
on the tape with Angler.

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.146
<i>Kevin, if you continue doing this,</i>

01:14:01.146 --> 01:14:03.731
<i>I have no choice
but to report you to the council.</i>

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:06.734
I don't know if Davis
was guilty of any crimes,

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:08.027
but do you wanna hear a theory?

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.237
Go ahead.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:12.574
I don't think
Angler ever worked for the CIA.

01:14:12.574 --> 01:14:14.534
<i>I think that's just what he told you.</i>

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.998
- Once you're in, you're in.
- I'm in.

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:22.959
What, you think he worked
for the Knights of Malta?

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.795
That I was assassinating people
for a charitable organization?

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.968
Sort of, I mean,
you heard Davis on the tape.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.720
He said that
they needed to find new funding

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.264
in order to keep the Knights
from finding out and stopping them.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.434
<i>But he was hiding a secret program.</i>

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.728
Used to kill bad guys.

01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:46.274
Keep your friends close in this job.

01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:50.278
So Angler had me kill Davis
before Davis could kill Angler.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:56.409
Yeah, and then he and whoever
he worked with moved on.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:15:01.623
Angler died. And now you've been working
for this other person or people.

01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:06.336
Look, I don't know what connects it all
or how they benefit from them all dying.

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:09.714
- But if we can figure that out...
- We'll find out who's behind all this.

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:10.924
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.388
Everything was a lie.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.600
<i>I haven't told you this.</i>

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.810
<i>- I wasn't sure what it meant.</i>
-  <i>What?</i>

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.188
When you were tied to the chair
in the hotel room,

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.774
<i>I went downstairs to confirm
Angler's death online.</i>

01:15:28.399 --> 01:15:31.402
<i>And you said that obituaries
get reprinted in various places,</i>

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:33.363
- but usually are all the same, right?
- Right.

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:38.409
Well, one of the obituaries I found
was different than the others.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:40.745
<i>The photo of Angler was different.</i>

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:43.498
<i>- And there was a poem with it.</i>
-  <i>What'd it say?</i>

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.584
"Against broken wings,

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.630
a front afraid, rise anew."

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.260
<i>That's Angler's kind of code.</i>

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.178
Against broken wings.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.180
<i>A code, but what does it mean?</i>

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:01.766
The code's Griffin.

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:04.978
Griffin?

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.399
I'm getting a really bad feeling
about all this.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.943
Are we doing something illegal?

01:16:11.943 --> 01:16:15.321
Look, business
is cutthroat sometimes, okay?

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.991
You know how important
corporate intelligence is

01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:19.617
and that's what this guy does.

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:24.330
We've created a state-of-the-art program
around him and us to protect us.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.208
Are you sure the big boss
isn't gonna punish us?

01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:31.212
It'll be fine, I promise.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.930
Where the fuck are you?
He's at the library in Valletta.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:41.848
Go there now.

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:44.100
<i>Yeah, well,
we got a little problem here, chief.</i>

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.144
<i>We lost a lot of men
fighting this problem.</i>

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:48.438
I don't give a fuck!
The bonus I just put in your account

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.732
should be more than enough
to cover losses. Get there now!

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:56.237
Fuck!

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:59.741
Okay, so ever since The Division
was shut down,

01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.994
all of the jobs that you've done
that don't seem to include bad guys,

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:04.620
all affected the stock market.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.623
And there's one company
that has benefited greatly from it.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.751
The Griffin Group.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.253
-  <i>The Griffin Group?</i>
-  <i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.797
<i>They're hedge fund conglomerates.
And guess where they're based?</i>

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.507
-  <i>Malta?</i>
-  <i>Yep.</i>

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:19.218
<i>They're like one of the top hedge funds
in the world.</i>

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:22.305
So they've had me
eliminating innocent people

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:23.389
<i>so they could make money.</i>

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.640
<i>Sure seems that way.</i>

01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:28.728
Sounds like we need
to pay them a little visit.

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:53.044
Okay.

01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:55.713
Oh, shit. Fuck.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.049
I have to call you back.

01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:03.721
You know who I am?

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:07.058
The consultant.
The corporate intelligence guy.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.769
Is that what they're calling it?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.565
Take us to him.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:18.694
Okay.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:38.131
Tony, we have a visitor.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.383
Whoa!

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:45.221
Fuck. In the flesh.

01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:47.515
The main man.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:49.559
You like what you see?

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.520
Huh? What do you think of the offices?

01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:55.481
I mean, you helped build them

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.985
and now we're one of the biggest
hedge funds in the world.

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:00.987
And how do you do that
when everyone has access

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:03.322
to the same information
using the same skills?

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:04.615
You cheat.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.200
Hey, lady...

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.786
I'm just an opportunist, lady, okay?

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:12.039
And you thought we'd never find out?

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:15.668
Eh, yeah, I did actually.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:19.547
We had to work very hard
to keep every aspect of him working.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:22.633
But at the end of the day,
business is business, right?

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:25.136
- We ain't in business.
-  Oh, really?

01:19:26.471 --> 01:19:28.222
At least let me make you an offer.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.309
Give it your best shot.

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:35.521
But it better be about more than money.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.191
You know, he was right about you,
wasn't he?

01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:41.235
He said you can pay a man to do anything,

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.364
but convince him he's doing it
for a cause, and he'll do it for free.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:48.075
- Who is "he"?
- I'm not telling you.

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.037
Not unless we're negotiating.

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:54.123
- I love negotiating.
-  Yeah.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.294
You want power.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.379
You want to be the puppet master.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.758
I can give you exactly what you need.

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:06.886
So come on.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:09.305
What do you say?

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.101
Shaw, no. No.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:16.896
No.

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:20.858
Fuck, we could rule the world together,
me and you.

01:20:22.527 --> 01:20:23.611
You sold me.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:29.700
Okay. I'll give you his location.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.202
<i>Let's get started.</i>

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:32.745
Do you need a boat?

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.290
<i>Yeah, a fast one.</i>

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.327
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:56.871
Frisky.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:03.628
What do you think, Grand National?

01:22:03.628 --> 01:22:04.545
Come on.

01:22:09.467 --> 01:22:10.426
Come on.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:14.805
Hey.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.684
-  Hey.
- Here you go.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:21.062
How you doing? You all right?

01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:22.813
I couldn't resist it,
you know what I mean?

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.941
Not exactly subtle.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.779
I mean, I only just bought it.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.239
But...

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:34.825
How you doing?

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:38.871
You all right?

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.331
You look good.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.584
You look really, really good.

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:45.795
Aw, fuck me.

01:22:45.795 --> 01:22:48.839
-  You lied to me, you piece of shit.
- All right.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:53.844
Calm down, all right.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.680
Yeah.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:04.355
- Of course I fucking lied to you.
- Fighting for my country, Kevin.

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:05.690
Who's it--

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.776
It doesn't really matter
who you're working for, does it?

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:11.987
I mean, you're killing "bad guys,"
aren't you?

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.364
Sean Davis a bad guy?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.534
No.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:19.745
No, no, Sean's a sweetheart. Yeah.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.958
You looking for a few answers, right?
Come on in.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.252
I'll show you around.

01:23:30.256 --> 01:23:34.135
You know what, maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just a greedy bastard.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.222
Maybe you should just kill me now.

01:23:42.727 --> 01:23:43.561
All right.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.876
Your old pal Griffin
sent me over here to kill you.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.837
Makes sense. Took his fucking time though.

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:12.381
Did you do a deal with him?

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:16.594
Yeah, we're still in negotiations.

01:24:16.594 --> 01:24:19.346
His boy's gonna be over any minute now,

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.474
- trying to kill us all.
- I know. Yeah.

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:26.395
I'm not exactly, you know, blind here,
but you know that.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.579
<i>You know what really bothers me</i>

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.956
ever since I found out
you still thought about my mom?

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.541
What are the chances she would die

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.543
right before Shaw
was about to leave The Division.

01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:53.088
I mean, you knew she was the only person
he would ever leave for,

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.965
and you knew
if anything were to happen to her,

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:56.967
he would never try anything again.

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.512
I like this one, she's a keeper.

01:24:59.512 --> 01:25:02.932
My only question is,
why didn't you try to kill me too?

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:09.855
You know, well, I told him,
like way back when, like the beginning.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:13.108
I told him that this job
is not for men like him.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.153
What if I took your life, Kev?

01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:18.781
Mm. Well, okay.

01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:21.951
What the hell is that?

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.454
Uh, it's Griffin.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:27.873
Just...

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:31.168
Uh, Colin, could you lock it down?
Thanks, mate.

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:37.049
If you could just hold off killing me,
just for a sec.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.095
We'll have some fun? Okay.

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:34.773
<i>Disciple 6,
come into the grid on those CVs. Over.</i>

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.568
- You got any weapons here?
- Yeah, yeah, loads of them.

01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:39.278
Over there, loads of them.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:42.781
That's it.

01:26:44.408 --> 01:26:45.659
Okay.

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:47.786
What kind of music you like?

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:54.126
- Don't make a mess, all right.
- Oh, come on, Kev.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.504
Who's your favorite Spice Girl?

01:26:58.047 --> 01:27:00.591
- None of the Spice Girls.
-  You don't like the Spice Girls?

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.719
Who doesn't like the Spice Girls?
I like Mel.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:07.973
Doris Day, anyone?

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:13.270
<i>Disciple 6, you're clear to engage.</i>

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:55.873
Fuck.

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:02.004
Team two, main house, now.

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:09.428
Fucking told you so, didn't I?

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.395
Found a secondary route
through the basement.

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:21.857
Bring the cars around to these gates.
You hear that, Tanner?

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:31.116
All right. Yeah.

01:29:42.086 --> 01:29:43.504
Open fire!

01:31:00.414 --> 01:31:01.248
Kev?

01:31:04.585 --> 01:31:05.419
Kev?

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.549
No, no, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:12.050
Dead already.

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:17.347
Take this. Take this.

01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:22.561
- Yeah, I got you.
- All right. Good luck.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:24.104
I got your back, all right?

01:31:25.856 --> 01:31:27.149
Good luck.

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:29.193
All right, I got you, I got your back.

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:31.778
Come on, let's go.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.823
-  Go, go, go.
- On me.

01:31:55.219 --> 01:31:56.678
Fuck, where are you?

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:12.527
Oh, shit. Hold on, I'll get you a bandage.

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:14.071
He's not fucking here.

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:16.949
He's not here.

01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:26.416
He's gone.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:28.710
He's not here.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.213
Here. Oh, fuck.

01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:33.757
Here you go.

01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:47.104
There's a hidden staircase in the kitchen.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.856
Always choose something
with an exit, right?

01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:52.025
Yeah. You remembered, huh?

01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:56.196
<i>We've gotta find him.</i>

01:32:57.656 --> 01:33:00.867
He has to be in the building.
Split into two groups.

01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:14.298
Here we go.

01:33:16.967 --> 01:33:20.012
- You go up, I'll cover you.
- What? No, no, we go together.

01:33:23.724 --> 01:33:25.058
- No.
- Go on, Kacey, go on.

01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:28.020
No, I didn't come all this way
just to leave you behind.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.776
You came all this way for the truth
and you found it, now let's go.

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.404
- No, I won't just leave you here.
- Kacey, listen to me.

01:33:37.404 --> 01:33:41.908
You're brilliant, you're beautiful,
you're everything your mother ever was.

01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:44.411
But I just found you.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:51.209
You did more than find me, you saved me.

01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:02.489
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:04.116
All right.

01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:06.451
This ain't over yet, let's go.

01:35:06.451 --> 01:35:07.953
Move, go, go, go.

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:09.955
Go, go, go.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.597
Come on, move.

01:35:47.117 --> 01:35:47.951
Go.

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:57.127
Whoa! Cover. Cover.

01:36:59.523 --> 01:37:00.357
Go!

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.209
Dad!

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:44.359
Dad!

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:15.867
I don't know
what to say, Monica, except...

01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:20.538
I'm gonna give this father a thing a try.
I'm gonna give it everything I have.

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.416
I'm gonna protect our daughter.

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:26.795
I promise you that.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.730
You know, there's a place
that she really liked right near here.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:48.316
- We can go get lunch there if you want.
- Let's go.

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.529
<i>You got a new journal.</i>

01:39:52.529 --> 01:39:56.366
So I guess no more breaking codes, just...

01:39:57.283 --> 01:39:58.118
No.

01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:02.747
Just drawing beautiful things.

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:13.007
You know, I, um...

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.137
I have been on my own so long

01:40:17.137 --> 01:40:19.764
I don't know
if I know how to be any other way.

01:40:20.974 --> 01:40:21.933
But, um...

01:40:25.145 --> 01:40:26.187
I mean, I thought...

01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:31.317
Maybe we could figure it out together.

01:40:31.317 --> 01:40:32.902
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:40:39.576 --> 01:40:42.203
There's one other thing
I have to take care of first.

01:40:43.705 --> 01:40:45.206
Whatever you say, Dad.

01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:49.461
I'll see you later.

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:51.755
See you later.

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.106
Yeah.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.902
She's already had a fortune.
She's not having no more.

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:17.238

01:41:17.238 --> 01:41:18.698
They both know what I'm capable of.

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:55.109

and when he not, will be victorious."

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:07.163
Negotiations are over.
