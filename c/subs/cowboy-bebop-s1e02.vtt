00:16.599 --> 00:19.644
Hola, amigos,
all you bounty hunters out in the system.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.645
How are you doing?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.772
Punch and I have
got a good one for you today.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.859
[Punch] That's right, Judy,
a mad bomber is terrorizing Venus.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.319
He's blown up not one, not two,

00:28.403 --> 00:31.197
but three public buildings
in the last ten days.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.741
And word on the street is

00:32.824 --> 00:38.413
this master-of-boom only has one hand
and a creepy calling-card to match.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.664
Roll the vid!

00:43.251 --> 00:45.003
[timer beeping]

00:50.300 --> 00:51.384
[robotic laughter]

00:51.468 --> 00:53.428
-Get back!
-[explosion]

00:54.554 --> 00:55.388
Holy shit.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.475
Maybe he's trying to make a statement?
Who knows?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.477
This is a juicy steak, cowboys.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.396
With a two million woolong bounty.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.856
Two million, Punch?

01:04.939 --> 01:07.567
That's one of our biggest bounties
in a long time.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.902
Yes, indeed, Judy!

01:08.985 --> 01:11.196
-So--
-So go get him!

01:12.614 --> 01:14.240
I was supposed to say that part.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.704
[organ music playing]

01:19.788 --> 01:21.748
[Spike] I'm just saying,
you don't need the ceremony.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.709
You skip right to the reception.
People would be much happier.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.378
-[Jet] The ceremony is the whole point.
-No. No.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.006
-Great music, open bar, food.
-[indistinct chatter]

01:30.673 --> 01:32.675
I could do wedding receptions all day.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.636
Could you just focus? Please.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.973
You do realize this guy
is blowing up public buildings

01:39.057 --> 01:40.475
in the middle of the night, right?

01:40.558 --> 01:41.851
I do.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.520
Which means he has to plant them

01:43.603 --> 01:45.605
when the buildings are open,
during the day.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.275
-Look, we need the dough from this, so…
-[snorts]

01:49.359 --> 01:51.444
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the bathroom.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.446
I told you to lay off that Venusian tea.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.323
Stuff burns right through you.

01:55.907 --> 01:56.908
Thanks, Mom.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.578
-Excuse me. Sorry.
-[jazz music playing]

02:07.836 --> 02:08.962
[urinating]

02:10.547 --> 02:11.965
[Jet over radio] Can you hurry it up?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.886
I'm flowing as fast as I can.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.263
[Jet] Well, make it flow faster.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.639
More guests are arriving

02:19.722 --> 02:21.599
and I need you looking out
for anyone suspicious.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.017
I hate to break it to you, Jet,

02:23.101 --> 02:24.894
but you're
the most suspicious-looking guy here.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.523
Please, I did a year undercover
with Io bootleggers.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.151
Let's just say, I know how to blend in.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.320
[Spike] Jet, there's
a thousand buildings on Venus.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.698
Trying to figure out which one
this guy's gonna blow up next

02:36.781 --> 02:39.450
is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack of needles.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.162
And yet here we are at a wedding.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.330
[Jet] Hunches are
a very important part of our job.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.625
But, hey, I'm happy to stake it out alone.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.211
And the all-you-can-eat noodle bar
afterwards.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.424
Noodle bar?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.551
[chuckles]

02:56.634 --> 02:58.344
Well, you should never ignore a hunch.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.096
[door opens]

[grunts and groans]

03:43.223 --> 03:44.849
What, are you taking a dump now?

03:45.516 --> 03:46.684
-We ain't got all day.
-[static]

03:47.477 --> 03:48.311
Hello?

03:54.984 --> 03:55.818
[grunts]

03:58.071 --> 03:59.364
[grunting]

04:17.632 --> 04:18.466
Spike!

04:19.050 --> 04:20.051
Hello?

04:20.551 --> 04:21.678
God damn it.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.810
Spike? I think I got something.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.436
[panting]

[gunshots]

[both grunting]

04:49.163 --> 04:49.998
Hey, pal.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.585
You know what's worth 2 million woos
and looks good in handcuffs?

04:54.669 --> 04:55.920
[people gasp]

04:59.382 --> 05:00.425
[Jet groans]

05:01.801 --> 05:03.636
-[yells]
-Shit.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.221
God damn it, Spike, where are you?

[gunshots]

05:17.734 --> 05:19.068

05:19.152 --> 05:21.988
Move, move! Move! Move!

[assassin panting]

05:28.619 --> 05:29.662
[groans]

05:38.546 --> 05:39.464
Who sent you?

05:41.132 --> 05:41.966
The Syndicate?

05:42.759 --> 05:43.676
Fuck you,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.429
that's who. [laughs]

05:58.649 --> 06:00.234
[grunts and groans]

06:00.318 --> 06:01.611
[theme music playing]

06:16.334 --> 06:18.336
[theme music continues playing]

07:53.890 --> 07:55.975
[Spike] You keep saying it
like it was all my fault.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.312
It was your goddamn fault.
I needed you and you weren't there.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.399
Look, I'm sorry
about your face and all, all right?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.026
But the good news is your hunch was right,

08:05.109 --> 08:08.446
so unless you died and I didn't notice,
how about we move on, huh?

08:08.529 --> 08:09.947
I haven't died yet.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.493
And lucky for you, I got this.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.955
Oh. I could use an extra hand.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.041
Evidence, wise-ass.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.793
The bomber had
to handle the explosives, right?

08:22.877 --> 08:25.254
-Hmm.
-Figure there's got to be traces on it.

08:25.796 --> 08:26.797
[Spike] Hmm.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.430
[beeps]

08:34.514 --> 08:37.266
The chem-sig reader will tell us
what kind of explosives he used.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.768
Then we can source suppliers.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.144
Yeah.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.605
Uh-huh.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.858
Spike!

08:46.901 --> 08:47.944
Are you even with me?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.905
Yeah. Yeah. Uh…

08:50.988 --> 08:55.243
You know, explosives and then
we gotta find that supplier, right?

08:56.035 --> 08:58.454
Hey, how long is this gonna take,
do you think?

08:59.163 --> 09:00.248
Couple of hours.

09:00.831 --> 09:01.832
[Spike] Hmm.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.546
-I'm going to go get some noodles.
-The hell you are.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.131
-We've got to dissect this.
-"This" being?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.092
-The bomber's manifesto.
-Oh.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.176
If we're going to find this guy,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.637
we've got to figure out
what kind of crazy asshole he is.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.555
Right.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.016
Anarchist, terrorist, guy who never got
his Boy Scout badge from fire-making.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.937
Um, yeah, I don't read when I'm flying.
Makes me nauseous.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.064
We're not flying, Spike.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.732
I'm about to be.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.859
Like I said, I never got my noodles.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.778
Spike.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.697
Spike!

09:33.281 --> 09:34.949
We're in the middle of a goddamn job.

09:37.868 --> 09:38.869

10:13.863 --> 10:14.864
[man 1] Okay.

10:16.782 --> 10:17.950
[man 2] Here you go.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.204
Have a lovely evening.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.706
We always do, darling.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.709
Well, well, looking gorgeous as ever,
Mrs. Langford.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.668
[Peggy laughs]

10:27.752 --> 10:31.005
And you, you're quite sharp
and delicious yourself. [laughs]

10:31.088 --> 10:33.049
Always the tease, Gren.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.594
And the music has only just begun.
Shall we imbibe?

10:36.677 --> 10:37.928
[Peggy chuckles] Mmm-hmm.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.431
-[jazz music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

10:44.060 --> 10:45.936
Now, you'll be thrilled to know that

10:46.020 --> 10:48.606
I personally reserved table 8
for you tonight.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.025
[Peggy] Nice. Front and center.

10:51.108 --> 10:55.613
The Markmans were vying for that spot
but I just plain like you two more.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.990
-[Peggy laughs]
-[Buck chuckles] Oh, naughty Gren!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.534
What you must say about us
when we're not around.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.286
Only decadent things.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.788
[Peggy] Mmm. [laughs]

11:06.540 --> 11:08.584
I, uh, heard a rumor…

11:08.668 --> 11:10.836
[Gren] Rita Leontine
is not on the bill tonight.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.923
Oh, don't be coy.
We all know she's on planet.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.966
And she craves her after-hours jams.

11:16.050 --> 11:20.054
And of course, where better to jam
into the wee hours than Ana's?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.180
[Peggy] Mmm-hmm.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.266
Oh, the birdies do squawk so
when they shouldn't.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.518
[Peggy] Hmm.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.104
I shall neither confirm it nor deny,

11:28.771 --> 11:29.605
but

11:30.606 --> 11:34.235
you may want to order that second bottle
of reserve and linger 'til sunup.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.653
[laughs]

11:36.737 --> 11:37.738
Keep 'em coming.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.574
-Decadent.
-[Peggy laughs]

11:42.243 --> 11:43.744
[indistinct chatter]

12:10.771 --> 12:13.399
[Daveed] My father taught y'all folks
to stand up like a man!

12:13.482 --> 12:14.650
[groans]

12:16.110 --> 12:17.653
You forget where you are.

12:19.071 --> 12:23.242
Tory, what's the first commandment
of Ana's?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.327
Differences die at the door.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.747
[Ana] Now, imagine me telling Santiago

12:27.830 --> 12:31.625
you were spinning up
some bullshit in my place?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.919
-Get him out of here.
-[bouncer] Let's go.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.839
It'd be his balls in the sugar bowl.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.258
And good night to you too, Detective.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.551
But he…

12:41.552 --> 12:42.720
Fine. I'm going.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.390
Making a drop.

12:46.974 --> 12:47.975
Send it.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.212
[gasps]

13:18.172 --> 13:19.173
Surprise.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.343
They told me…

13:24.678 --> 13:26.055
They told me you were dead.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.890
It's okay.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.810
I'm okay.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.312
Hey. I'm okay.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.942
-[grunts]
-[groans]

13:38.818 --> 13:41.654
-[chuckles] Ow.
-Three years.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.741
Three years you let me believe
you were dead.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.201
They tried to kill me, Ana.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.912
Of course they did.
No one leaves the Syndicate.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.913
Not even you.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.790
Start talking.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.461
[jazz music playing]

14:01.507 --> 14:06.345
"Food, water and education
are a form of mind control."

14:07.888 --> 14:11.892
"People can only be pushed so far,
but also not far enough."

14:14.061 --> 14:14.895
[groans]

14:14.979 --> 14:18.524
"All will see the Angel's halo
shimmering in the sky."

14:19.984 --> 14:21.944
[snickers] Gibberish.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
All of it.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.282
[Spike] May I?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.076
By all means, help yourself.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.997
Oh. No Kudo?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.208
[sighs]

14:38.919 --> 14:40.129
What happened to your leg?

14:42.923 --> 14:43.924
Getting old.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.678
[sighs]

14:50.764 --> 14:53.017
Ah. There she is.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.395
Cheers.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.564
Thank you.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.613
[Ana] So what brings you back
from the dead after all these years?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.948
A week ago I did a job.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.076
I got mixed up in some Syndicate shit.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.786
What kind of job?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.207
A bounty.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.420
-Don't. Stop. [chuckles]
-[laughing]

15:22.421 --> 15:23.964
You're a cowboy?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.507
What else would you have me do?

15:25.591 --> 15:28.260
-Something that won't get you killed.
-Okay.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.345
[Ana chuckles]

15:31.180 --> 15:33.307
-So did you leave any loose ends?
-No.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.809
Nothing to worry about then.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.270
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.482
Until an assassin came at me this morning.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.781
It wouldn't be the first time
an old bounty came after me, but, um…

15:50.741 --> 15:51.825
Today was different.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.411
The guy was Syndicate-trained.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.873
What they send to take care of a problem.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.549
Say I agree to help, which I shouldn't,

16:07.633 --> 16:11.929
since you let me believe you were dead,
let me mourn you.

16:13.263 --> 16:17.559
But let's pretend I can find it
in my dark heart to forgive you.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.354
Why come to me?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.986
So you can do what you do best.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.124
You can listen.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.334
[mysterious music playing]

16:44.837 --> 16:46.213
[indistinct chatter on TV]

16:50.968 --> 16:52.302
[beeping]

16:58.684 --> 17:01.437
Replay the security footage
for the bombings, Marvin.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.190
[imperceptible]

17:18.412 --> 17:21.832
"And all will see the Angel's halo
shimmering in the sky."

17:27.713 --> 17:29.882
Piece of shit
just likes to watch them burn.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.093
[scoffs] Where the hell is he?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.263
[dialing]

17:37.097 --> 17:39.141
[line ringing]

17:42.728 --> 17:45.773
Marvin, track the location
of the Swordfish.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.483
[beeping]

17:50.986 --> 17:51.987
[sighs]

17:52.071 --> 17:53.530
[vibrating]

17:58.494 --> 18:00.829
-I've got to go.
-[Ana] Hot date?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.540
My partner, believe it or not.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.293
He know what you used to be?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.295
-[chuckling] No.
-[laughs]

18:10.339 --> 18:13.175
Dying didn't teach you
that lying is no way to be?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.969
You don't know him.
He wouldn't understand.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.805
And you ain't going to give him a chance.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.306
The guy's an ex-cop.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.433
He despises the Syndicate.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.018
It would…

18:23.727 --> 18:25.229
[sighs] It would break him.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.189
Then he'd break me.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.500
[somber music playing]

18:46.583 --> 18:47.584
[gunshot]

18:53.632 --> 18:54.716
Is she happy?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.719
[breathes deeply]

19:02.349 --> 19:03.433
She's married now.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.561
To Vicious.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.646
Been a few years.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.232
And, yeah,

19:11.525 --> 19:12.401
she's happy.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.201
I have to go.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.496
If I hear anything,
I'll reach out the usual way.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.707
Thank you.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.417
And, Fearless…

19:31.879 --> 19:33.380
will I ever see you again?

19:35.382 --> 19:36.550
Fearless is dead.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.261
I go by Spike Spiegel these days.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.350
[ominous music playing]

19:59.865 --> 20:01.033
[knocking at door]

20:05.537 --> 20:06.914
[knocking continues]

20:08.498 --> 20:09.374
What?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.546
The Elders would like a word.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.682
[warbling]

20:45.410 --> 20:46.620
[breath trembling]

20:48.747 --> 20:50.832
[Caliban] You betrayed us, Vicious.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.461
You've been dealing Red-Eye
behind our backs.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.974
I was merely attempting
to expand our business.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.519
Our profits.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.649
Your profits. I thought if we--

21:15.732 --> 21:19.152
[Caliban] You thought?
You're not here to think.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.698
-You're here to do as you're told.
-[hesitates]

21:28.996 --> 21:32.582
I misunderstood.
It won't happen again. Forgive me.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.710
[Prospero] Words are insufficient.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.672
[Miranda] Actions must be taken.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.384
[Caliban] Loyalty must be proven.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.806
[gun cocks]

21:57.149 --> 21:58.358
[Prospero] Take from us…

21:58.442 --> 22:00.652
[Miranda] We take from you.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.779
[Caliban] Your wife.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.496
-Please.
-Vicious…

22:11.580 --> 22:13.457
Please. [breathing heavily]

22:15.083 --> 22:16.168
Anything else.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.381
Take a finger. Take my whole hand.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.843
[Caliban] Syndicate above all else.

22:26.887 --> 22:27.888
[Julia gasps]

22:30.265 --> 22:31.391
[Julia crying]

22:41.026 --> 22:41.860
Vicious.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.448
Please.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.038
[sobbing] Please.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.798
[Caliban] Do it!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.091
-[gun clicks]
-[whimpers]

23:08.720 --> 23:12.349
[Caliban] Don't make us question
your loyalty again, boy.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.283
-[Jet] Look who finally showed up.
-[Spike] You're welcome.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.911
[Jet] While you were out chasing a meal,
you know what I was doing?

23:32.994 --> 23:35.122
-No, but I bet you're gonna tell me.
-The job.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.458
Analyzing the explosives,
breaking down its composition,

23:39.042 --> 23:41.211
hoofing it to every demo site in Ishtar.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.296
This is the fifth place I've checked.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.841
Which you'd know if you'd
picked up your goddamn phone.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.759
[Spike] Yeah, I would have,
if I thought it was important.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.263
Jesus, you're prickly today.
Hard times at that noodle shop?

23:51.346 --> 23:53.432
-It was a bust.
-Yeah, tough nuts for you.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.683
Yeah, I get crabby when I'm hungry.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.518
-I hear you.
-[man] Excuse me.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.728
Mind telling me
what you're doing on my job site?

24:01.481 --> 24:03.817
And you think the explosives came from us?

24:03.900 --> 24:07.320
[Jet] He's using Vaxium Nitrate to target
buildings made of Venusian quartz.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.614
When the two interact,
they create a halo-like effect

24:09.698 --> 24:11.366
that the bomber seems to enjoy.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.536
You can use a lot of different types
of explosive to demo Venusian quartz.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.871
We analyzed a bomb fragment.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.331
You mean your machine analyzed
a bomb fragment.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.501
When you cook an egg, do you need
to give credit to the frying pan?

24:21.585 --> 24:22.627
I'm just saying.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.255
It's Vaxium Nitrate. We're positive.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.965
Your machine is positive.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.885
At least I didn't screw off
to get noodles for six hours,

24:29.968 --> 24:31.303
and not even get noodles.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.805
-I told you where I was going--
-You didn't tell me anything.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.057
-That's the whole point. You--
-Hey, hey. Hey!

24:36.141 --> 24:38.059
-[both arguing]
-[whistles] What the hell?

24:38.143 --> 24:41.688
I've seen the good-cop, bad-cop routine,
but never the dick-cop, asshole-cop.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.857
-We're not cops.
-Then what are you?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.693
-Just assholes?
-Oh.

24:46.776 --> 24:47.819
What we are

24:48.528 --> 24:50.739
is not above cutting you in on the payout.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.699
If you help us.

24:55.994 --> 25:00.373
Look, I'd love to make some extra scratch,
but nothing's missing from our stock.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.876
I go over the paperwork
at the end of every week myself.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.420
The Vaxium Nitrate didn't come from us.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.838
You have the paperwork to prove it?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.424
You don't believe me,
ask Theodore yourself.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.635
Theodore?

25:12.219 --> 25:14.179
Our supplies guy. Theodore Clark.

25:14.262 --> 25:16.389
Keeps the stock in his freighter
a few buildings down.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.474
[Spike] Wait.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.522
Are you telling us
your bomb guy's name is Teddy?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.026
Could it really be this easy?

25:28.109 --> 25:30.028
[Jet] I don't know. It's never this easy.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.739
[Spike] How do you want to do this?
Door knock or B and E?

25:32.822 --> 25:35.825
[Jet] Mmm… B and E.
That way we get the drop on him.

25:36.326 --> 25:39.120
[Spike] Okay. You B, I'll E.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.753
[Jet] Whatever's up your ass,
you've just got to tell me.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.339
It's probably nothing
I haven't heard before.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.801
Yeah.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.971
This is what partners do.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.056
They air this shit out.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.187
Look, um, I'm…

26:04.980 --> 26:05.814
tired.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.858
I'm tired and I'm hungry,
that's all. Really.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.653
So, um, let's get this guy
and get out of here.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.029
-All right?
-All right.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.494
[breathing heavily]

26:23.248 --> 26:24.249
[exhales heavily]

26:39.347 --> 26:40.932
I knew the gun wasn't loaded.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.393
-The weight was off.
-Liar.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.941
What was I supposed to do?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.152
Make sure the gun is loaded next time.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.278
-Julia--
-No!

26:54.654 --> 26:56.823
No, you promised to keep me safe.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.702
From the Elders. Especially from him!

27:02.412 --> 27:05.624
But I see now
you will always be in the shadow.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.709
-Julia--
-You may as well put a bullet in me now.

27:07.792 --> 27:10.837
Because you will never be man enough
to stand up for yourself!

27:10.920 --> 27:13.048
-[gasps]
-[breathing heavily]

27:13.632 --> 27:15.842
Don't you ever

27:16.635 --> 27:18.178
-tell me…
-[whimpers]

27:20.597 --> 27:24.142
-…I'm not man enough.
-[chokes]

27:32.567 --> 27:34.069
[sobbing]

27:38.615 --> 27:39.824
[bell dinging in distance]

27:48.792 --> 27:51.336
-[whirring]
-[suspenseful music playing]

27:56.549 --> 27:57.550
[whispering] Put your gun away.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.220
We're surrounded by explosives.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.069
Hey, where are you going?

28:16.778 --> 28:18.154
[whispering] He's probably in the cockpit.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.906
That's too obvious.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.199
It's too…

28:21.282 --> 28:22.659
-Follow me.
-Yeah, but the cockpit--

28:22.742 --> 28:23.743
Spike.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.747
I… He's probably in the cockpit.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.548
What?

28:38.550 --> 28:39.426
Booby trap.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.136
Step on that,

28:42.137 --> 28:44.013
you're wearing your asshole for an ascot.

28:44.889 --> 28:45.932
Whoa.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.644
Hey. You're welcome.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.535
Yikes.

29:07.704 --> 29:08.788
[Spike sniffs]

29:28.558 --> 29:29.642
Still warm.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.021
He was just here.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.231
-[thudding]
-[engine starts]

29:35.315 --> 29:36.566
And we're moving.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.742
Shit.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.077
Cockpit! Don't you dare say it!

29:48.661 --> 29:50.705
-Don't you dare say "I told you so!"
-[Spike] I won't.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.248
But I did.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.388
-[groans] It's locked.
-Is he in there?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.390
I don't think so. I can't see him.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.892
Maybe he's crouched down by the door.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.936
-[alarm beeping]
-[thudding]

30:14.521 --> 30:15.647
[Jet] Oh, shit.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.190
[Spike] Probably just space debris.

30:17.273 --> 30:20.568
I've seen "just space debris"
shred armored ISSP cruisers.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.986
Would you relax?

30:22.070 --> 30:25.406
We have been through a hundred of these.
There's nothing to worry about.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.283
-[explosion]
-[Spike] Whoa!

30:36.584 --> 30:37.877
I think we lost our bounty.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.879
[Spike] And any way to steer this thing.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.048
We've got to get off this ship
before it blows.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.466
Help me look for an escape pod.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.468
Are you serious? On this bucket?

30:45.552 --> 30:48.054
What piece of crap ship
doesn't have an escape pod, Spike?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.348
-Your piece of crap ship.
-Hey!

30:50.431 --> 30:52.016
And if you would have listened to me

30:52.100 --> 30:53.852
and gone to the cockpit
in the first place,

30:53.935 --> 30:55.061
none of this would be happening.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.564
You know, I've been giving you
the benefit of the doubt

30:57.647 --> 30:58.815
because I figured you had a shit day,

30:58.898 --> 31:01.776
but I'm 100% sure
that your being an asshole

31:01.860 --> 31:03.236
has nothing to do with noodles.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.153
What?

31:04.988 --> 31:06.030
What is that supposed to mean?

31:06.114 --> 31:08.324
Who turns off their tracker
for six hours to get noodles?

31:08.408 --> 31:09.993
Are you… Are you tracking me?

31:10.076 --> 31:11.786
-Where were you?
-I was at a bar.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.413
-With who?
-What does it matter with who?

31:13.496 --> 31:16.040
It matters because partners
don't disappear on partners.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.041
I'm there when it counts.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.334
Until you're not!

31:19.294 --> 31:21.504
I need honesty
from the guy who's watching my six.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.339
[beeps]

31:25.341 --> 31:27.010
[sighs] God damn it.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.177
[beeping]

31:31.139 --> 31:32.891
[whimsical music playing]

31:38.396 --> 31:40.231
[Teddy Bomber speaking indistinctly]

31:43.526 --> 31:44.694
I'm sorry, what?

31:44.777 --> 31:46.905
-Did you get that?
-No.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.073
[speaking indistinctly]

31:49.741 --> 31:52.410
[Jet] I'm sorry, I can't understand a word
you're saying with the mask on, pal.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.954
[groans in frustration]

31:56.706 --> 31:57.916
[speaking indistinctly]

31:57.999 --> 32:00.209
Oh, no. I got it.

32:01.252 --> 32:06.299
He's going to blow us sky high
if we don't catch the Ichabod.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.927
-Yeah.
-[speaking indistinctly]

32:09.010 --> 32:10.094
What the hell is an Ichabod?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.347
How the hell am I supposed to know?
You read the manifesto.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.264
I skimmed it.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.224
You skimmed the manifesto?

32:15.308 --> 32:17.435
Well, you weren't there.
I had a bonsai to take care of.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.063
After the guilt trip you gave me,
you didn't even read the manifesto?

32:20.146 --> 32:21.940
-We were running out of fuel.
-You told me to read it.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.983
-I mean, the point was--
-Huge guilt trip.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.694
-[Jet] Spike!
-[shouting indistinctly]

32:29.614 --> 32:32.533
Hey, I hear you.
You are making a lot of great points.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.119
We get it.
You're going to blow us sky high…

32:35.662 --> 32:38.539
-[muffled shouting]
-Right. I understand. You are a bad man.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.335
[upbeat jazz music playing]

32:42.418 --> 32:43.920
[screams]

32:46.297 --> 32:47.548
[grunting]

33:02.438 --> 33:03.606
Spike!

33:23.876 --> 33:25.211
[Jet grunts]

33:28.339 --> 33:29.298
[sighs]

33:34.429 --> 33:35.430
Clutch move.

33:39.642 --> 33:40.476
Oh.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.437
Not Ichabod.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.606
-Escape pod.
-Escape pod.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.275
[both laughing]

34:10.506 --> 34:11.716
You take the escape pod.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.760
I can handle the weight--

34:13.843 --> 34:15.094
[beeps]

34:16.721 --> 34:18.097
I'll probably get distracted.

34:18.765 --> 34:21.225
Stop for noodles or at a bar,
or take a massive dump.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.435
Or all three, so…

34:28.066 --> 34:29.067
I'll be back.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.529
[Jet grunts]

34:33.613 --> 34:35.281
-Jet. Um…
-Yeah.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.535
There is something I've got to tell you.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.546
I'm starving.
Would you mind bringing me those noodles?

34:52.632 --> 34:53.633
[chuckles]

34:54.634 --> 34:55.635
You got it, partner.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.183
Thanks, partner.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.853
[jazz music playing]

35:22.703 --> 35:23.955
We should have Tui tell him.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.873
He's not going to kill us.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.836
Have at it.

35:36.092 --> 35:36.926
[Shin] Boss.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.053
We got word on Gunther.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.346
Fearless killed him.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.350
At the church.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.018
