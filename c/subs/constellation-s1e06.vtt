WEBVTT

00:23.941 --> 00:25.859
- We have to whisper.
- <i>Why is that?</i>

00:27.277 --> 00:29.947
'Cause they're doing
something very fiddly at the CAL.

00:30.822 --> 00:31.782
Hey, Alice.

00:31.782 --> 00:32.991
<i>Hi, Paul.</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.451
Your mom's big day today.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.121
RPL. CAL data:

00:38.121 --> 00:41.625
Core signals green, magnets align, 25.5.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.963
Core temperature: minus 203 degrees.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.673
Tune lasers.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.757
Come on.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.802
<i>What does it do?</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:53.929
It's looking for a new state of matter.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.266
<i>Wow.</i>

00:57.266 --> 00:59.309
Let's see if we can find you.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.270
There you are.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.525
Hey, Alice.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.277
Wave to yourself.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.997
Mamma?

01:20.664 --> 01:21.665
Mamma?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.126
Mamma? Are you there?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.295
Everything all right?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.088
She's gone.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.757
Yeah, well, we have to get going too.
Come on.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.593
Station, RPL, you copy?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.887
Get them back.
We're in the middle of something.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.681
Debris! Scallation!

01:44.396 --> 01:45.230
<i>Mamma?</i>

01:46.148 --> 01:47.774
Alice!

01:47.774 --> 01:48.859
Ali--

02:41.453 --> 02:42.454
Jo!

02:45.457 --> 02:46.708
Jo!

02:50.379 --> 02:51.797
Michaela, we lost the CAL.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.883
Houston, this is Station.
We have a depress. I need help.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.263
Jo.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.684
Jo. Come on, Jo.
Stay with me. Talk to me, Jo.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.189
Paul? How is she?

03:12.651 --> 03:13.652
Paul!

03:14.444 --> 03:16.905
- Paul!
- Audrey, give me the baby wipes!

03:37.759 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, black.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.137
It's black for a bat.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.556
Boys, not too much of that glittery stuff.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.057
You know it goes everywhere.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.649
It's a bit sticky, isn't it?

04:01.617 --> 04:04.870
I tell you what, let's just--
let's just start again, here we go.

04:04.870 --> 04:05.954
Start again.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.767
Daddy?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.193
Alice.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.238
I love you so much.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.326
I have to tell you something terrible.

04:54.837 --> 04:55.838
Seat belt.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.490
Where the hell have you gone?

06:04.323 --> 06:05.782
Hey, Alice.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.662
I'm so sorry.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.084
Do you wanna go sit with Wendy?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.128
Yeah? Okay.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.840
Magnus, I'm so sorry.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.676
I can't believe it. Just-- It's awful.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.058
Hi, Alice.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.227
Hi, Wendy.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.998
<i>Entry angle: 95 degrees.</i>

06:56.166 --> 06:57.501
Ready down there?

06:57.501 --> 07:00.712
- Ready. Parameters are set.
- Good luck.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.714
Anything you want us to say?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.259
I was working on
the Cold Atomic Laboratory.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.052
The CAL.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.929
We lost it.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.306
- The what?
- It's a NASA experiment.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.726
Audrey, we need to pass that on to RPL.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.270
Henry Caldera.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.857
Paul, I don't know
which experiment you mean.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.442
Just pass it on.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.361
Okay.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.113
Anything for your family?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.656
Tell them I'm on my way home.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.701
Tell them that.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.226
Hey. Wake up. We're here.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.813
Come on. I'll carry you.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.358
Come on.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.695
Is she home?

08:07.571 --> 08:08.572
No.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.116
They've brought the first one down
in Kazakhstan.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.452
She's coming down
in the next one with Paul.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.120
He just needs to fix the Soyuz first.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.081
If you die in space,

08:19.750 --> 08:21.293
do you die on Earth?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.463
Just get some sleep, honey.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.508
You'll feel a lot better
after you've had some sleep.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.222
It's cold.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.602
I mean...

09:43.083 --> 09:45.335
Alice? Honey?

09:49.298 --> 09:51.258
Come on, don't hide from me.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.600
Oh, for God's sake.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.686
Please?

10:06.690 --> 10:12.446
<i>October 1960, an R-16 prototype explodes
on the launch</i>

10:12.446 --> 10:14.114
<i>on Baikonur cosmodrome...</i>

10:14.114 --> 10:15.199
Alice.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.869
You cannot just go like that.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.246
Okay? Even if I'm asleep.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.916
Come on, what are you doing in here?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.459
What is that?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.836
An accident at Baikonur.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.130
A hundred people died.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.301
You can't watch stuff like that.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.637
Come on.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.223
Are you hungry?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.350
You want pancakes?

10:41.350 --> 10:42.851
I want to stay here.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.520
No. Come on. Come out.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.813
Alice, give me the iPad.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.191
I'll give you the iPad.
I'm not coming out.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.526
I'm not letting you sit in the dark

10:50.526 --> 10:53.070
and watch this horrible stuff
on YouTube, okay?

10:53.070 --> 10:54.863
Now, come on.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.865
- Come on.
- I want to stay on my own!

10:56.865 --> 10:57.950
Please, Daddy!

11:43.287 --> 11:44.454
Mamma!

11:56.383 --> 11:57.384
Daddy!

11:58.760 --> 12:01.847
If you can hear me in the blind,
this is Station.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.017
Transferring and reconnecting
battery number five.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.685
Undocking in...

12:53.106 --> 12:54.274
What the fuck?

13:39.695 --> 13:42.739
<i>The third. The third.</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:44.783
<i>Need to hurry up.</i>

13:45.701 --> 13:47.536
<i>This is the third. Come on.</i>

13:47.536 --> 13:48.996
<i>Need to hurry up.</i>

13:52.374 --> 13:53.500
<i>Paul?</i>

14:07.472 --> 14:08.891
Houston, this is Station.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.393
- <i>Station, this is Houston.</i>
- There you are.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.353
Thank God for that.

14:14.313 --> 14:15.814
<i>What is your status?</i>

14:18.775 --> 14:22.070
Houston, what are the protocols
on dealing with a dead body?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.239
<i>Station, what's your concern?</i>

14:26.742 --> 14:27.743
My concern...

14:29.995 --> 14:31.205
The concern is...

14:34.499 --> 14:36.418
Ericsson is so badly lacerated.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.547
My concern is that
when the body gets out of zero-G,

14:41.089 --> 14:44.218
we're gonna have severe loss
of blood in the capsule during reentry.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.929
<i>Station, copy that. We'll get back to you.</i>

15:39.606 --> 15:41.066
You gotta stop breathing.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.278
Stop breathing, Jo.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.198
You stay in Destiny.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.921
Jo, I'm sorry.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.455
Do you think there's any such thing
as ghosts?

16:36.455 --> 16:38.957
I don't know. Maybe.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.004
Do you think ghosts are the same as God?

16:45.714 --> 16:47.049
I don't believe in God.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.801
You don't believe in God?

16:50.302 --> 16:52.346
No. I'm English.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.350
Wendy!

16:57.768 --> 16:59.603
Wendy, Daddy's coming home!

17:03.273 --> 17:04.398
It's okay.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.865
My mamma's coming home too.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.126
Hey.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.380
Hi.

17:28.674 --> 17:29.675
Alice...

17:34.555 --> 17:37.891
I'm afraid they're gonna leave Mamma
up there.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.363
Setting coordinate.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.252
I got a red light.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.963
Powering all nine switches.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.428
<i>Check your battery meter.</i>

18:14.928 --> 18:15.929
It's dead.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.974
What have we got in the event
of a bolt system malfunction?

18:18.974 --> 18:21.143
<i>In the event of bolt system malfunction,</i>

18:21.143 --> 18:24.813
<i>bolts to be armed and fired
from Soyuz control panel in Zvezda.</i>

18:25.564 --> 18:27.858
All the way
on the other side of the hatch.

18:28.859 --> 18:30.068
<i>It requires two crew members.</i>

18:30.068 --> 18:33.197
- TsUP. TsUP, come in.
- <i>I am sorry, Commander...</i>

18:33.906 --> 18:35.324
Come on. Come on.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.035
Come on.

18:38.702 --> 18:39.828
Come on!

18:48.754 --> 18:49.755
Come on!

18:57.012 --> 18:58.096
Bolts armed.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.196
Ten.

19:15.531 --> 19:16.532
Rate gyros.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.033
Twenty.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.494
Fire thrust.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.288
Okay.

19:34.633 --> 19:38.053
Station, this is Soyuz 1. Do you copy?

19:40.055 --> 19:41.056
Station?

19:44.393 --> 19:45.394
Fuck.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.309
I love you so much, Frida.

21:08.602 --> 21:09.686
I love you too.

21:10.521 --> 21:12.439
Erica is my name.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.366
She was in the Soyuz.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.954
Paul took her out.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.207
He...

21:32.334 --> 21:33.710
left her up there,

21:34.336 --> 21:35.546
for some reason.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.549
In space?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.012
Look...

21:47.432 --> 21:48.433
Maybe...

21:55.983 --> 21:58.110
Maybe the way we have to think
about it is...

22:00.821 --> 22:01.822
You know, like...

22:04.366 --> 22:05.951
Like the pyramids.

22:06.702 --> 22:13.292
They've been there for thousands of years
just to be the last home for...

22:15.294 --> 22:17.838
a great pharaoh or leader.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.548
Yeah?

22:20.257 --> 22:23.552
'Cause the ISS is
also one of the great things

22:23.552 --> 22:25.053
that humanity has ever made.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.389
This is her home, Daddy.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.058
With us.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.344
Why didn't you bring her back?

23:59.690 --> 24:00.732
Listen, Alice.

24:02.901 --> 24:05.612
I conferred with Houston,
the mission control--

24:05.612 --> 24:08.532
- I know what Houston is.
- Conferred with them about what?

24:09.908 --> 24:11.910
Look, there's no easy way to say this.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.163
- But your mother was so badly injured.
- Okay.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.791
You see, her whole side of her face
was stuck and getting pulled--

24:17.791 --> 24:19.459
What the fuck are you doing?

24:20.252 --> 24:22.754
- Come on. Come on.
- W-what did she look like?

24:23.547 --> 24:24.673
No, no. Come on.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.551
- Magnus, I'm sorry.
- Jesus Christ.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.724
Paul, have you had your psych evaluation?

24:37.769 --> 24:38.770
Have you?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.486
Excuse me?

24:54.119 --> 24:55.954
I determine how I feel, okay?

24:59.333 --> 25:00.626
You guys weren't there.

25:02.628 --> 25:05.464
I received and obeyed an instruction.

25:06.715 --> 25:09.676
And I don't need you to speak
to any NASA personnel, okay?

25:14.056 --> 25:15.516
You mind your business.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.654
Hey!

26:18.245 --> 26:19.413
What are you doing?

26:21.081 --> 26:22.708
What are you doing to your rabbit?

26:22.708 --> 26:24.168
I don't want it.

26:25.169 --> 26:26.920
I can help you clean it up.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.256
I don't want the shitty little rabbit.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.382
It's for kids.

26:32.301 --> 26:34.178
Alice, it's your rabbit.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.943
I was first up that day.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.779
Scheduled phase six at CAL experiment.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.782
What is CAL?

26:57.492 --> 26:58.493
What is CAL?

26:59.286 --> 27:00.704
It's Cold Atomic Laboratory.

27:01.288 --> 27:03.665
It's a RPL experiment.
It's a NASA experiment.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.835
Right before the collision,
I was in phase...

27:11.215 --> 27:13.300
I was locking in lasers with Audrey here.

27:16.178 --> 27:17.179
Paul seems to...

27:19.890 --> 27:21.225
Paul seems to what?

27:22.434 --> 27:25.020
This was an issue before we undocked also.

27:25.521 --> 27:26.647
I think maybe--

27:27.314 --> 27:30.609
I think maybe we're using
different terminology.

27:35.781 --> 27:36.990
Play the tape.

27:37.950 --> 27:39.576
<i>Do you want to take a look at the lettuce?</i>

27:39.576 --> 27:40.786
<i>I think they're looking fairly perky.</i>

27:40.786 --> 27:42.746
<i>Some of them have woken up a bit.</i>

27:42.746 --> 27:43.789
<i>What do you think?</i>

27:44.957 --> 27:46.333
<i>Isn't it magical? Wow.</i>

27:48.752 --> 27:51.088
That is what you were working on there?

27:52.923 --> 27:56.134
Hey, Paul.
Maybe we're talking about different things

27:56.134 --> 27:59.763
but we don't know
what the Cold Atomic Laboratory is.

28:01.515 --> 28:04.309
The CAL project
was abandoned 12 years ago.

28:06.979 --> 28:10.983
For me, the issue is why the decision
was unilaterally taken

28:10.983 --> 28:14.611
to move Ericsson's body from Soyuz 1
and leave her on the ISS.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.406
Her family's left down here
with no good answers.

28:17.406 --> 28:19.700
Maybe we should take a break.

28:20.784 --> 28:23.161
I don't understand
what I am being put through.

28:24.830 --> 28:28.458
We shared the responsibility for
the decision to leave Ericsson up there.

28:29.251 --> 28:30.919
Houston has to back me up there.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.714
I made the right call, correct?

28:34.298 --> 28:35.799
You were up there, Paul.

28:36.592 --> 28:37.718
It was your judgment.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.220
I was ordered to leave her up there.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.599
Yes. Based on your assessment.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.442
I was ordered to leave her up there.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.729
FROM ALICE
FOR MAMMA

31:10.495 --> 31:11.788
<i>I'm a teacher.</i>

31:13.665 --> 31:14.917
I thought I could handle

31:16.460 --> 31:19.213
most emotional situations
that kids are going through.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.382
She's your own child.

31:23.425 --> 31:24.510
It's very different.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.262
She's growing away.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.682
So what am I supposed to do about that?

31:32.017 --> 31:33.018
You know,

31:34.353 --> 31:40.150
instinctively, maybe we keep children
away from funerals, mourning.

31:40.734 --> 31:44.238
But they are important ways for us
to be able to process

31:44.238 --> 31:46.240
that someone's been lost.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.285
So, maybe she needs some kind of ceremony.

31:53.872 --> 31:58.335
<i>Man embarks once again
on history's great adventure.</i>

31:58.335 --> 32:00.295
<i>At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida,</i>

32:00.295 --> 32:05.634
<i>a titanic, complex and fragile vehicle
waits to take three Americans</i>

32:05.634 --> 32:08.929
<i>on the last currently planned flight
to the moon.</i>

32:17.437 --> 32:20.899
<i>And liftoff.
Liftoff of the 18th Apollo mission,</i>

32:20.899 --> 32:22.526
<i>and it has cleared the tower.</i>

32:41.753 --> 32:43.547
<i>We've lost pressure.</i>

32:43.547 --> 32:44.798
<i>Please</i>!

32:48.218 --> 32:49.511
<i>Loss of contact.</i>

32:54.016 --> 32:55.434
<i>Loss of contact.</i>

32:59.438 --> 33:02.774
<i>Houston, this is Caldera. Two men died!</i>

33:02.774 --> 33:06.236
<i>Voice recordings
of American astronauts signaling</i>

33:06.236 --> 33:09.198
<i>that a cover-up took place
when two men lost their lives</i>

33:09.198 --> 33:10.574
<i>on the way back from the moon.</i>

33:11.491 --> 33:12.492
Knock-knock.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.829
- Hey.
- Michaela, where's Henry Caldera?

33:17.164 --> 33:18.290
Who?

33:18.290 --> 33:19.499
Commander Caldera.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.543
You mean of Apollo 18?

33:23.086 --> 33:24.671
Bud Caldera.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.798
The guy who built the CAL.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.227
Paul.

33:39.478 --> 33:40.771
What is this?

33:40.771 --> 33:42.356
Nobel Prize.

33:42.356 --> 33:43.774
The Rocket Propulsion Lab.

33:44.566 --> 33:45.943
The man who built the CAL.

33:45.943 --> 33:48.570
Nobody built this machine.

33:48.570 --> 33:51.031
Paul, for Christ's sake,
there is no machine.

33:52.199 --> 33:53.200
Look...

33:56.370 --> 33:58.705
I'm sorry,
but you gotta get a hold of yourself.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.832
- I'm in complete command of myself.
- Paul.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.334
But the last fucking thing
that I was doing--

34:02.334 --> 34:04.628
Don't swear at me, Commander.

34:05.295 --> 34:08.172
The last thing that I was doing
before the collision

34:08.799 --> 34:10.467
was tuning the lasers on the CAL.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.971
I was being instructed
by Commander Henry Caldera

34:13.971 --> 34:15.514
of the Rocket Propulsion Lab.

34:16.681 --> 34:19.601
And all of a sudden, there's no machine.

34:20.853 --> 34:22.228
There's no Henry Caldera.

34:25.482 --> 34:26.859
Is this some kind of cover-up?

34:30.112 --> 34:31.237
Where is he?

34:31.989 --> 34:33.364
Where is he, Michaela?

34:34.241 --> 34:35.449
I don't know.

34:35.993 --> 34:37.327
Dead in a ditch somewhere?

34:39.036 --> 34:40.038
Drunk?

34:41.415 --> 34:45.418
Apollo 18, it's NASA's greatest fuckup.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.757
Paul.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.552
Paul.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.259
How you doing, Wendywoo?

35:37.012 --> 35:38.222
I think she's just fine.

35:40.891 --> 35:42.434
Your name Wendywoo?

35:43.810 --> 35:44.811
Erica.

35:49.441 --> 35:50.484
School okay?

35:53.195 --> 35:54.780
Nine-year-old girls.

35:56.490 --> 36:00.827
There's nothing more dangerous or fierce
in nature than a nine-year-old girl.

36:03.247 --> 36:04.540
You getting picked on?

36:08.669 --> 36:10.671
Don't chew with your mouth open, Wendy.

36:10.671 --> 36:11.755
Paul.

36:13.173 --> 36:14.258
You speak to Alice?

36:15.008 --> 36:16.009
Uh-uh.

36:16.677 --> 36:17.886
You didn't speak to her?

36:18.637 --> 36:19.638
Not yet.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.265
She's your friend, Wendy.

36:22.391 --> 36:24.268
Her mother was just killed, you know?

36:25.435 --> 36:28.105
There's a funeral coming up,
and you ought to check in on her.

36:29.565 --> 36:31.066
Her mother was killed and...

36:33.277 --> 36:36.196
- your daddy had to leave her up there.
- I think they're-- they're fine.

36:36.196 --> 36:37.489
They're good.

36:42.452 --> 36:43.453
In the depress.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.624
You know her eyes, she--

36:47.624 --> 36:48.709
Breakfast.

36:51.545 --> 36:52.546
Please.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.967
Can we enjoy the breakfast
and not talk about eyes again?

36:59.511 --> 37:00.512
Please.

38:09.790 --> 38:10.791
Alice?

38:13.961 --> 38:15.003
Alice, come on.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.132
Alice?

38:37.150 --> 38:38.151
Alice.

38:38.652 --> 38:40.028
Come on. Come out of there.

38:41.071 --> 38:42.406
Fuck off.

38:46.994 --> 38:50.581
Look, everyone's downstairs,

38:51.456 --> 38:55.294
and we are all gonna gather now
and say a few words about Mamma.

38:56.253 --> 38:57.629
I don't want to.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.590
Why do I have to?

39:03.302 --> 39:05.095
Because it's what we do.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.641
We have to say goodbye.

39:09.641 --> 39:12.352
It's stupid to say goodbye
when Mamma's still there.

40:07.157 --> 40:08.158
Paul?

40:10.953 --> 40:12.120
Paul!

40:16.792 --> 40:18.752
I lost the ISS for the whole world.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.130
I'm the guy that took that away.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.215
Paul.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.093
Just wait here for a second, okay?

40:28.095 --> 40:31.098
It was an accident, yeah?
I'm sick of saying it. It was an accident.

40:31.098 --> 40:33.267
Do you know how impossibly hard I worked?

40:34.768 --> 40:35.811
Every minute.

40:35.811 --> 40:37.771
Every hour I worked harder than...

40:39.231 --> 40:40.315
But when it came down to it,

40:40.315 --> 40:42.693
I'm just one of those guys
who failed on my watch.

40:42.693 --> 40:45.904
- Daddy. You didn't fail.
- Wendy, it's okay.

40:48.282 --> 40:49.283
Come on.

40:52.744 --> 40:54.037
Now, come on.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.539
I committed sacrilege.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.335
I took my friend's hand, and I just
threw her out there in the cold.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.087
That's what you were told to do.

41:05.799 --> 41:07.259
I made an excuse.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.346
- Because I was a coward in that moment.
- Stop.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.931
I made an excuse.

41:12.931 --> 41:15.475
And I just left her up there
because I was scared.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.395
And I don't even know.

41:19.396 --> 41:21.398
I mean, she could still be up there alive.

41:23.692 --> 41:24.735
Paul.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.364
Come on. You're not able to do this.

41:30.657 --> 41:32.034
Let's go home.

41:42.044 --> 41:43.045
Paul.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.330
You talk to Alice?

42:19.665 --> 42:20.791
How's she doing?

42:21.542 --> 42:23.836
I can't talk to Alice anymore.
She's jealous.

42:24.628 --> 42:26.129
She was my friend.

42:26.755 --> 42:28.382
She just lost her mother, Wendy.

42:29.007 --> 42:30.050
Don't be an asshole.

42:33.262 --> 42:34.471
Wendy.

42:36.181 --> 42:37.641
What did you say to her?

42:37.641 --> 42:38.725
Paul.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.436
So many fucking things that are wrong.

42:41.436 --> 42:42.521
Shit.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.733
I can-- I can barely catch my breath.

42:46.733 --> 42:48.402
- Well, come out then.
- Yeah, I...

42:55.534 --> 42:56.535
Hey.

42:58.412 --> 42:59.788
How's my girl?

43:00.622 --> 43:01.498
Hey, Alice.

43:02.082 --> 43:04.001
My daddy has something to say to you.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.754
- What?
- I think maybe we should all--

43:07.754 --> 43:10.257
He says that your mamma
may still be alive.

43:21.518 --> 43:22.811
Daddy?

43:23.437 --> 43:24.438
God! Paul!

43:25.856 --> 43:28.275
Alice, what? What is it?

43:31.486 --> 43:33.030
- Mamma?
- Paul?

43:34.031 --> 43:36.742
- Don't wake her up.
- She's awake.

43:38.619 --> 43:41.288
Mamma!

43:43.624 --> 43:45.083
Hey! Hey, hey. You're okay.

43:45.083 --> 43:47.503
You're okay. Come on.
Why don't we go upstairs?

43:50.756 --> 43:51.840
Everything's okay.

44:01.391 --> 44:02.726
Well, this was a mistake.

44:06.563 --> 44:07.814
You're too young.

44:09.608 --> 44:10.859
I'm nearly 11.

44:14.404 --> 44:16.031
I think we need a time out.

44:17.241 --> 44:19.868
We need to go away, just you and me,
somewhere where this is not--

44:19.868 --> 44:21.036
The cabin.

44:22.704 --> 44:25.332
No. No, it's freezing up there.

44:25.332 --> 44:27.668
Mamma's cabin. I want to go to the cabin.

44:27.668 --> 44:29.920
Let's-- Let's go to Mexico.

44:30.838 --> 44:31.755
Or something.

44:32.840 --> 44:33.966
LEGOLAND?

44:33.966 --> 44:35.634
I want to go up to the cabin.

44:42.599 --> 44:43.600
Okay.

44:59.032 --> 45:00.284
Paul?

45:05.414 --> 45:06.415
Paul.

45:08.792 --> 45:09.793
Hi.

45:09.793 --> 45:11.170
Erica.

45:11.170 --> 45:13.422
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course. I'm here.

45:14.339 --> 45:15.591
I don't know where he is.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.886
He said he was gonna
get some air last night,

45:18.886 --> 45:20.596
and he never came back.

45:21.763 --> 45:23.849
I keep calling him,
and he's not answering his phone, I--

45:23.849 --> 45:26.768
We have a rehabilitation clinic.

45:26.768 --> 45:27.728
What?

45:27.728 --> 45:32.024
For astronauts who find it hard
to return to Earth.

45:32.024 --> 45:33.859
No, we just need to get out there and--

45:33.859 --> 45:37.487
We don't discuss it much,
but it does happen.

45:39.114 --> 45:42.075
It's called high-altitude psychosis.

45:43.410 --> 45:47.706
Look, we have ways
of successfully treating it, but...

45:49.750 --> 45:53.128
Occasionally, it requires an intervention.

45:53.128 --> 45:55.839
We need to find him now.

45:55.839 --> 45:58.091
And we will. But I'm sorry.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.053
After we find him,

46:02.846 --> 46:04.139
he'll need to go away.

46:53.188 --> 46:54.231
Well, that's it.

46:55.107 --> 46:56.108
We're snowed in.

46:57.317 --> 46:59.570
I mean, we're not gonna be able to--

47:00.070 --> 47:01.154
We can walk.

47:02.823 --> 47:04.950
It's like two kilometers, Alice.

47:04.950 --> 47:06.535
Come on. Look at it.

47:09.079 --> 47:10.664
We can just go across the lake.

47:11.999 --> 47:14.251
I'm not driving a car
across a frozen lake.

47:16.211 --> 47:19.047
The only way we could get there
is if we did walk,

47:20.841 --> 47:25.220
but I think the best thing is just to go
back to Älmedalen and get a hotel.

47:30.475 --> 47:31.476
We'll walk.

47:32.728 --> 47:33.854
Alice.

47:41.403 --> 47:42.529
Alice, stop.

47:46.074 --> 47:47.075
Alice!

47:49.703 --> 47:51.330
Why don't you just listen to me?

47:52.998 --> 47:54.583
My mamma's dead.

47:56.460 --> 47:57.836
And my wife is dead.

48:02.966 --> 48:03.967
Alice!

49:31.221 --> 49:32.848
Come on. In, in, in.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.627
I remember these paintings.

50:02.669 --> 50:03.712
Mamma liked them.

50:07.758 --> 50:09.009
It's a changeling.

50:11.011 --> 50:13.263
Those paintings
always freaked me out a bit.

50:14.181 --> 50:15.390
They are spooky.

50:17.142 --> 50:18.143
I like them.

50:20.604 --> 50:23.482
Fine. Right, of course you do.

50:25.651 --> 50:27.277
I'm allowed to like them.

50:28.362 --> 50:30.489
I'm not saying you're not allowed
to like them.

50:31.573 --> 50:33.367
Of course, if you like them, it's fine.

50:34.034 --> 50:36.578
But if I liked them,
you wouldn't like them. Right?

50:37.162 --> 50:38.372
What?

50:39.915 --> 50:40.916
I give up.

50:52.511 --> 50:54.304
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:56.431 --> 50:58.642
I'm a long way from being perfect.

51:01.478 --> 51:02.771
But I'm trying my best.

51:03.605 --> 51:05.107
Daddy, don't cry.

51:08.026 --> 51:10.946
We'll see her again one day. I promise.

51:11.989 --> 51:13.198
Alice.

51:15.617 --> 51:16.618
We won't.

51:18.537 --> 51:19.830
You have to listen to me.

51:20.956 --> 51:22.583
We're not gonna see Mamma again.

51:24.042 --> 51:25.586
We're not. Ever.

51:26.628 --> 51:27.838
She's dead.

51:28.463 --> 51:31.341
We have to start again from here.

51:32.843 --> 51:34.636
I know you probably don't like that.

51:34.636 --> 51:37.055
I'm sorry
that I'm the one that you've got.

51:37.055 --> 51:40.934
But we have to start again from here.

52:02.539 --> 52:03.874
Yeah?

52:06.210 --> 52:07.461
Commander Caldera?

52:07.961 --> 52:09.379
I prefer Bud.

52:12.299 --> 52:13.675
You don't remember me.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.302
No. Who the fuck are you?

52:16.094 --> 52:17.221
Paul Lancaster.

52:18.555 --> 52:19.556
Bullshit.

52:20.557 --> 52:21.725
You don't remember me?

52:21.725 --> 52:23.185
You remember me?

52:23.769 --> 52:24.770
Yeah.

52:26.396 --> 52:28.023
But not like this.

52:28.023 --> 52:30.442
Oh, really? You have a good day.

52:30.442 --> 52:32.694
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Henry, listen!

52:32.694 --> 52:35.072
Henry? I don't use that name.

52:35.072 --> 52:36.615
My name's not Henry.

52:36.615 --> 52:38.867
You trained me at NASA.

52:38.867 --> 52:40.160
I'm gonna lose my temper.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.870
For Christ's sakes, help me out here.

52:41.870 --> 52:43.247
Why would NASA send you?

52:43.247 --> 52:45.207
You just got back from space, asshole.

52:45.207 --> 52:46.917
You left a body up there.

52:47.501 --> 52:48.502
Yeah.

52:50.254 --> 52:51.296
Yeah, I did.

52:52.840 --> 52:54.091
But they didn't send me.

52:55.467 --> 52:56.635
Nobody sent me.

52:57.678 --> 52:58.679
I need you to--

52:58.679 --> 53:01.473
Henry, you gotta get me
some fucking answers here.

53:03.183 --> 53:04.393
Oh, Christ.

53:05.477 --> 53:07.020
I'm going fucking insane.

53:18.365 --> 53:20.784
I recall an accident on Apollo 18.

53:20.784 --> 53:22.619
Yeah, there was a fucking accident.

53:25.581 --> 53:26.999
But you all came back home.

53:30.335 --> 53:31.420
You were a hero, sir.

53:33.589 --> 53:35.132
Yeah, there was an accident.

53:35.132 --> 53:38.302
The cabin pressure.
There was a sudden loss of pressure.

53:38.302 --> 53:39.386
Two men died.

53:39.386 --> 53:40.804
Nobody died. It was repaired.

53:40.804 --> 53:44.224
- Two men died, Ted Larsen and B--
- Nobody died.

53:45.434 --> 53:47.978
It was repaired by you.

53:48.812 --> 53:49.813
It's been...

53:53.066 --> 53:57.029
the honor of my life to work with you,
Commander.

53:58.614 --> 54:00.449
No. No.

54:02.201 --> 54:03.493
I want answers.

54:03.493 --> 54:07.164
No. I can't go back there
and neither can you.

54:07.164 --> 54:10.501
- You're gonna fucking tell me right now.
- No, you take your fucking pills.

54:10.501 --> 54:12.169
No, fuck taking my pills.

54:13.587 --> 54:14.838
Tell me what happened.

54:15.547 --> 54:18.300
And you tell me why you're
in this piece of shit apartment.

54:19.676 --> 54:21.011
This is what happened.

54:21.595 --> 54:23.805
It may not be what I thought happened.

54:25.015 --> 54:28.602
But this, here, is what happened.

54:28.602 --> 54:30.187
You shouldn't be here.

54:30.687 --> 54:33.273
This is your last chance
to get out of my apartment.

54:33.273 --> 54:34.858
No, you fucking tell me.

54:36.109 --> 54:37.402
You tell me.

54:38.362 --> 54:39.988
And give me some answers right now.

54:40.989 --> 54:42.658
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- I'm not taking shit.

54:42.658 --> 54:43.742
You get out!

54:44.910 --> 54:45.911
Get out.

54:47.371 --> 54:50.832
Commander Caldera,
you tell me why you're here.

54:50.832 --> 54:54.336
You tell me why the fuck are you here.

54:54.336 --> 54:55.504
No, wait! Hey!
