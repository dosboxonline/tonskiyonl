WEBVTT

03:08.501 --> 03:10.336
Thank you very much

03:10.337 --> 03:11.671
and welcome to
<i>To Tell the Truth.</i>

03:11.672 --> 03:13.940
Our first guest,
he's made a career

03:13.974 --> 03:16.142
out of being the most
outrageous impostor

03:16.143 --> 03:18.211
that we've ever come
across on this show

03:18.212 --> 03:20.112
and you're going to
see what I mean.

03:20.113 --> 03:23.049
Number One,
what is your name, please?

03:23.050 --> 03:24.884
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

03:24.885 --> 03:26.219
Number Two?

03:26.220 --> 03:28.554
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

03:28.555 --> 03:29.889
Number Three?

03:29.890 --> 03:32.058
My name is
Frank William Abagnale.

03:32.059 --> 03:36.279
"From 1964 to 1967,
I successfully impersonated"

03:36.280 --> 03:38.948
"an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airways"

03:38.949 --> 03:42.218
"and I flew over
two million miles for free."

03:42.219 --> 03:45.888
"During that time, I was also
the chief resident pediatrician"

03:45.889 --> 03:47.823
"at a Georgia hospital"

03:47.824 --> 03:49.858
"and an assistant
attorney general"

03:49.859 --> 03:51.594
"for the State of Louisiana."

03:51.595 --> 03:53.963
"By the time I was caught,
I was considered"

03:53.964 --> 03:56.966
"the youngest and most daring
con man in U.S. history."

03:56.967 --> 04:00.403
"I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks"

04:00.404 --> 04:03.772
"in 26 foreign countries
and all 50 states."

04:03.773 --> 04:07.143
"And I did it all
before my 19th birthday."

04:07.144 --> 04:10.246
"My name is
Frank William Abagnale."

04:10.247 --> 04:12.148
<i>♪ You don't know how ♪

04:13.250 --> 04:14.902
<i>♪ You don't know how ♪
♪ to tell the truth... ♪</i>

04:14.903 --> 04:16.219
So, for the first time

04:16.220 --> 04:17.820
he's going to have
to tell the truth

04:17.821 --> 04:20.189
and we're going to start
our questioning with Kitty.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.742
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent...

04:22.743 --> 04:24.912
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow...

04:24.913 --> 04:27.963
why didn't you go in
for a legitimate profession?

04:27.964 --> 04:30.500
It was really a question
of dollars and cents.

04:30.501 --> 04:32.136
When I was a young man,
I needed the money

04:32.137 --> 04:33.903
and I thought
this list of careers

04:33.904 --> 04:35.605
was the easiest way to get it.

04:35.606 --> 04:36.973
I see.

04:36.974 --> 04:39.409
Number Two, I find this all
very fascinating.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.345
Who was it
that finally caught you?

04:42.146 --> 04:44.413
His name was Carl Hanratty.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.449
Han-an-an-ratty.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.650
Ratty.

04:47.651 --> 04:49.084
Hanratty.

04:49.085 --> 04:50.119
Han-ratty.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.421
Carl Hanratty.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.789
Yes. I...

04:53.790 --> 04:56.392
am... Carl Hanratty.

04:56.393 --> 05:00.796
I represent the FBI from
the United States of America.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.233
Yeah. I have orders

05:04.234 --> 05:07.170
to see the American
prisoner, Abagnale.

05:33.997 --> 05:37.500
You sit here.

05:37.501 --> 05:40.336
You do not open the door.

05:40.337 --> 05:44.006
You do not pass him...

05:44.007 --> 05:47.376
anything through the hole.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.021
Aw... Jesus.

06:19.409 --> 06:21.644
You know, I've got
a little bit of a cold myself.

06:21.645 --> 06:22.911
Frank...

06:22.912 --> 06:25.581
I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

06:25.582 --> 06:28.150
according to the
European Court for Human Rights.

06:28.151 --> 06:30.786
"Article One,
Extradition shall be granted"

06:30.787 --> 06:33.021
"in respect of offenses
punishable under the laws..."

06:33.022 --> 06:34.390
Help me.

06:34.391 --> 06:36.592
"...for the maximum period
of at least one year"

06:36.593 --> 06:38.894
"of a severe penalty."

06:38.895 --> 06:40.062
Help me.

06:40.063 --> 06:43.198
Frank... stop it.

06:43.199 --> 06:45.501
Help me.

06:45.502 --> 06:48.170
You don't think actually
you can fool me, do you?

06:50.173 --> 06:52.475
16 pages to go.
Stay with me.

06:52.476 --> 06:54.710
"Article Two."

06:54.711 --> 06:56.279
"If the request for extradition"

06:56.280 --> 06:58.013
"includes several separate
offenses"

06:58.014 --> 06:59.448
"each of which is punishable
under the laws..."

07:00.450 --> 07:01.784
"of the requesting party..."

07:01.785 --> 07:03.986
Frank?

07:05.889 --> 07:08.056
Frank?

07:08.057 --> 07:09.158
Goddamn it!

07:09.159 --> 07:12.060
Get me a doctor in here!

07:12.061 --> 07:13.562
Yes.
I need a doctor!

07:13.563 --> 07:14.930
Doctor! Now!

07:14.931 --> 07:16.432
Don't sweat it, Frank.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.401
We're going to get you
right to a doctor.

07:21.672 --> 07:23.572
Frank, if you can
hear me, don't worry.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.608
I'm going to take you
home in the morning.

07:25.609 --> 07:26.942
Home in the morning, Frank.

07:31.281 --> 07:32.615
What are you doing?

07:32.616 --> 07:33.949
Washing off the lice.

07:33.950 --> 07:36.385
This man has to be on a plane
for America.

07:36.386 --> 07:37.787
He has to see a doctor.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.488
The doctor comes in tomorrow.

07:39.489 --> 07:41.457
I have worked too long,
too hard

07:41.458 --> 07:43.592
for you to take
this away from me.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.128
If he dies, I'm holding
you responsible.

07:52.268 --> 07:53.903
Monsieur!

07:58.107 --> 07:59.908
Ah, Frank.

08:42.118 --> 08:43.885
Okay, Carl...

08:43.886 --> 08:46.989
let's go home.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.592
<i>The New Rochelle Rotary Club</i>

08:49.593 --> 08:52.628
<i>has a history</i>
<i>that goes back to 1919.</i>

08:52.629 --> 08:54.096
In all those years

08:54.097 --> 08:57.966
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

08:57.967 --> 09:00.836
inducted as lifetime members.

09:00.837 --> 09:02.872
It's an honor that, uh

09:02.873 --> 09:07.676
that has seen 57 names enshrined
on the wall of honor

09:07.677 --> 09:10.212
and tonight, we make it 58.

09:10.213 --> 09:13.682
So please stand as I present
my very good friend

09:13.683 --> 09:16.318
a man who keeps
our pencils sharp...

09:17.821 --> 09:19.555
and our pens in ink...

09:19.556 --> 09:22.224
Frank William Abagnale.

09:42.111 --> 09:43.712
I stand here humbled

09:43.713 --> 09:46.916
by the presence
of Mayor Robert Wagner...

09:51.354 --> 09:54.423
and our club president,
Jack Barnes.

09:59.429 --> 10:03.265
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife Paula...

10:05.836 --> 10:09.371
and my son, Frank Jr...

10:09.372 --> 10:11.540
Frank... Aw, stand up.
Come on...

10:15.011 --> 10:17.513
...sitting in the front row.

10:22.285 --> 10:27.089
Two little mice fell
in a bucket of cream.

10:27.090 --> 10:31.994
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

10:31.995 --> 10:36.365
The second mouse...
wouldn't quit.

10:36.366 --> 10:37.867
He struggled so hard

10:37.868 --> 10:41.504
that eventually he churned
that cream into butter

10:41.505 --> 10:43.405
and crawled out.

10:43.406 --> 10:47.710
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

11:04.861 --> 11:07.563
You're a better dancer
than your father, Frankie.

11:07.564 --> 11:09.164
You hear that, Daddy?

11:09.165 --> 11:10.365
Like fun.

11:10.366 --> 11:12.367
The girls don't
know what they're in for.

11:12.368 --> 11:15.404
Show him the dance
you were doing when we met.

11:15.405 --> 11:16.839
Ah, who can remember?

11:16.840 --> 11:19.374
The people
in that little French village

11:19.375 --> 11:21.276
were so happy to see Americans

11:21.277 --> 11:23.646
they decided
to put on a show for us.

11:23.647 --> 11:25.648
So they crammed 200 soldiers...

11:25.649 --> 11:27.650
Yeah, we know the story, Daddy.

11:27.651 --> 11:29.552
Into that tiny social hall

11:29.553 --> 11:31.887
and the first person
to walk onstage

11:31.888 --> 11:34.523
is your mother, and
she starts to dance.

11:34.524 --> 11:35.858
You know

11:35.859 --> 11:39.695
it had been months
since we'd even seen a woman

11:39.696 --> 11:41.563
and here's this blonde angel.

11:41.564 --> 11:43.031
Blonde bombshell.

11:44.868 --> 11:48.203
And the men are literally
holding their breath.

11:48.204 --> 11:49.772
Holding their breath for you.

11:49.773 --> 11:50.906
You hear that?

11:51.908 --> 11:52.908
Mm-hmm.

11:52.909 --> 11:55.143
And I turned to my buddies
and I said...

11:55.144 --> 11:57.312
"I will not leave
France without her."

11:57.313 --> 11:58.647
And I didn't.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.282
You didn't.

12:00.283 --> 12:02.150
I didn't.

12:03.185 --> 12:05.387
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, the rug!

12:05.388 --> 12:06.388
Aw, Mom...

12:06.389 --> 12:07.523
I can't believe I did that.

12:07.524 --> 12:09.024
No, no, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

12:09.025 --> 12:10.559
Oh, Frankie, Frankie,
get a towel.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
Paula...
Yeah, yeah.

12:11.561 --> 12:12.561
Come on.

12:12.562 --> 12:16.398
<i>♪ My sweet embraceable you... ♪</i>

12:16.399 --> 12:18.600
Dance with me, Paula.

12:20.503 --> 12:23.338
Ah...

12:29.211 --> 12:31.046
Whenever I dance for you

12:31.047 --> 12:33.148
I get in trouble.

12:39.288 --> 12:41.089
Watch this.

12:43.326 --> 12:46.294
Oh!

12:46.295 --> 12:47.295
Frank! Wake up.

12:47.296 --> 12:48.864
Come on, let's go!

12:48.865 --> 12:50.933
Get up.
Come on, come on.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.133
Frank, wake up.

12:52.134 --> 12:53.368
Dad...

12:53.369 --> 12:55.236
You don't have to go
to school today.

12:55.237 --> 12:56.672
It's okay.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.206
Why? Is it snowing?

12:58.207 --> 12:59.675
Do you have a black suit?

12:59.676 --> 13:01.510
I overslept again, huh?

13:01.511 --> 13:05.080
We have a very important
meeting in the city.

13:05.081 --> 13:06.982
Eat that.
Come on, come on, eat.

13:06.983 --> 13:08.617
Ma'am, open up.
Just open up, please!

13:08.618 --> 13:09.618
Ma'am?
It's important.

13:09.619 --> 13:10.786
What?

13:10.787 --> 13:12.387
Oh, gosh!

13:12.388 --> 13:13.722
We don't open for half an hour!

13:13.723 --> 13:15.591
Open the door, please.
Just open the door.

13:15.592 --> 13:16.592
It's important.

13:16.593 --> 13:18.560
I-I'm sorry, we don't open
for half an hour.

13:18.561 --> 13:19.661
What's your name, ma'am?

13:19.662 --> 13:20.863
Darcy.

13:20.864 --> 13:21.997
Darcy.
That's a pretty name.

13:21.998 --> 13:23.765
I'm in a bit of a fix.
I need a suit for my kid.

13:23.766 --> 13:24.766
This is my son Frank.

13:24.767 --> 13:25.767
Oh, hi.

13:25.768 --> 13:26.768
He needs a black suit.

13:26.769 --> 13:28.169
Black suit...

13:28.170 --> 13:29.538
There was a death
in the family.

13:29.539 --> 13:31.039
My father, 85 years old,
war hero.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.041
Yeah?

13:33.042 --> 13:35.844
There's a funeral
this afternoon, military funeral

13:35.845 --> 13:38.013
planes flying overhead,
21-gun salute.

13:38.014 --> 13:39.347
Geez.

13:39.348 --> 13:41.316
Frank needs to borrow a suit

13:41.317 --> 13:42.518
for a couple of hours.

13:42.519 --> 13:45.453
I'm sorry, we don't loan suits,
and we're not open.

13:45.454 --> 13:46.822
Darcy... Darcy, please.

13:46.823 --> 13:48.724
Come back.

13:48.725 --> 13:50.859
Darcy... is this yours?

13:56.533 --> 13:59.267
I just found it
in the parking lot.

13:59.268 --> 14:01.436
Uh-huh.

14:01.437 --> 14:04.005
It must've slipped
right off your neck.

14:06.643 --> 14:08.844
Don't hit the curb.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.551
Now get out,
walk around the back

14:15.552 --> 14:17.485
and hold the door open for me.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.063
All right.

14:28.064 --> 14:29.297
What's next?

14:29.298 --> 14:30.699
Okay, stop grinning.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.135
When I get inside, you go back
to the front seat and wait.

14:34.136 --> 14:36.672
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket

14:36.673 --> 14:38.740
you don't move the car,
understood?

14:38.741 --> 14:40.676
Dad, wha-what's
all this for?

14:40.677 --> 14:42.778
You know why the Yankees
always win, Frank?

14:42.779 --> 14:44.446
'Cause they have Mickey Mantle?

14:44.447 --> 14:46.147
No, it's 'cause the other teams

14:46.148 --> 14:48.617
can't stop staring
at those damn pinstripes.

14:48.618 --> 14:49.651
Watch this.

14:49.652 --> 14:51.553
The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

14:51.554 --> 14:56.158
is about to open the
door for your father.

14:57.627 --> 15:00.062
Mr. Abagnale, um

15:00.063 --> 15:02.163
we don't usually
loan money to people

15:02.164 --> 15:04.566
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.434
That's a misunderstanding.

15:06.435 --> 15:08.203
I hired the wrong
guy to do my books.

15:08.204 --> 15:10.005
A mistake, I...
anybody could make it.

15:10.006 --> 15:12.373
I just need you guys to
help me weather the storm.

15:12.374 --> 15:14.710
Sir, you're being investigated
by the government

15:14.711 --> 15:16.712
for tax fraud.

15:16.713 --> 15:18.847
My store is a landmark
in New Rochelle.

15:18.848 --> 15:20.782
I have customers
all over New York.

15:20.783 --> 15:23.418
Well, you're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

15:23.419 --> 15:24.519
We don't know you.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.321
I'm sure your bank
in New Rochelle

15:26.322 --> 15:28.423
they know you,
they could help you out.

15:28.424 --> 15:29.992
My bank went out of business.

15:29.993 --> 15:32.427
Banks like this one put
them out of business.

15:32.428 --> 15:34.596
Now, I know I made a
mistake, I admit that

15:34.597 --> 15:36.098
but these people want blood.

15:36.099 --> 15:37.099
They want my store.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.034
They've threatened
to put me in jail.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.237
This is America, right?

15:42.238 --> 15:43.304
I'm not a criminal.

15:43.305 --> 15:44.840
I'm a Medal of Honor winner

15:44.841 --> 15:47.643
a lifetime member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

15:47.644 --> 15:50.612
All I'm asking is for you
to help me beat these guys.

15:50.613 --> 15:53.181
It's not a question
of winning and losing.

15:53.182 --> 15:54.716
It's a question of risk.

15:54.717 --> 15:57.418
You're the largest
bank in the world.

15:57.419 --> 15:59.054
Where's the fu...

15:59.055 --> 16:01.957
Whe... Where's the risk?

16:06.929 --> 16:09.931
Dad, how could you just let him
take our car like that?

16:09.932 --> 16:11.967
He didn't take anything.
We took him.

16:11.968 --> 16:13.135
He overpaid by $500.

16:13.136 --> 16:16.404
Come on, Frank.

16:16.405 --> 16:17.873
Let's return the suit.

16:25.715 --> 16:27.215
This place is good.

16:27.216 --> 16:29.184
It's small but, you know

16:29.185 --> 16:31.753
it's going to be
a lot less work.

16:31.754 --> 16:33.354
A lot less work for you.

16:56.478 --> 16:57.813
Hey, Dad.

16:57.814 --> 17:00.015
Hi.

17:03.385 --> 17:05.453
Where's your mother?

17:05.454 --> 17:06.621
I don't know.

17:06.622 --> 17:11.259
She said something
about going to look for a job.

17:12.394 --> 17:13.560
What's she gonna be

17:13.561 --> 17:15.496
a shoe salesman
at a centipede farm?

17:21.604 --> 17:23.137
What are you doing?

17:24.673 --> 17:26.974
You want some pancakes?

17:26.976 --> 17:27.976
For dinner?

17:27.977 --> 17:29.878
On my son's 16th birthday?

17:29.879 --> 17:32.213
We're not gonna eat pancakes.

17:34.583 --> 17:37.219
Come on, why are you
looking at me like that?

17:37.220 --> 17:38.486
You thought I forgot?

17:38.487 --> 17:41.522
I didn't think you forgot.
I opened a checking account

17:41.523 --> 17:43.358
in your name.

17:43.359 --> 17:44.726
I put $25 in the account

17:44.727 --> 17:46.561
so you can buy
whatever you want.

17:46.562 --> 17:47.896
Don't tell your mother.

17:47.897 --> 17:48.997
I won't.

17:48.998 --> 17:50.198
Thanks, Dad.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.233
Yep.

17:51.234 --> 17:54.569
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan, though?

17:54.570 --> 17:56.004
Yes, they all turned me down.

17:57.406 --> 17:59.674
Then why you opening a
banking account with them?

17:59.675 --> 18:01.977
Well, because one day,
you'll want something

18:01.978 --> 18:03.879
from these people...
a house, a car.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.082
They have all the money.

18:09.652 --> 18:12.553
There's 50 checks there, Frank

18:12.554 --> 18:17.192
which means, from
this day on...

18:17.193 --> 18:19.394
you're in their little club.

18:19.395 --> 18:22.864
I'm in their little club.

18:22.865 --> 18:25.000
You got that, you got it all.

18:25.001 --> 18:29.404
It's even got
my name there, huh?

18:29.405 --> 18:30.738
To the moon.

18:30.739 --> 18:32.774
To the moon!

18:32.775 --> 18:35.743
To the moon.

18:44.053 --> 18:46.955
See that?
It's just a school.

18:46.956 --> 18:48.723
No different than Westbourne.

18:48.724 --> 18:52.727
Ma... you said you were
going to quit.

18:55.698 --> 18:59.234
Frankie, you don't have
to wear the uniform here.

18:59.235 --> 19:02.204
Why don't you take
off your jacket?

19:02.205 --> 19:05.240
I'm used to it.

19:09.611 --> 19:10.745
Excuse me.

19:10.746 --> 19:11.746
Oh, yes?

19:11.747 --> 19:13.648
Do you know where
room 17 French is?

19:13.649 --> 19:15.416
Yeah, it's...

19:23.659 --> 19:25.593
But you frickin' killed him.

19:29.131 --> 19:31.266
You selling encyclopedias?

19:31.267 --> 19:34.936
Yeah, he looks like
a substitute teacher.

19:49.551 --> 19:51.719
Quiet down, people!

19:51.720 --> 19:54.022
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

19:54.023 --> 19:57.259
That's Abagnale, not Abagnahlee

19:57.260 --> 20:00.695
not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale!

20:00.696 --> 20:02.931
Now, somebody please
tell me where you left off

20:02.932 --> 20:05.133
in your textbooks.

20:06.402 --> 20:08.136
Excuse me, people,
if I need to ask again

20:08.137 --> 20:09.804
I'm going to write up
the entire class.

20:09.805 --> 20:12.340
Take your seats!

20:16.312 --> 20:17.912
Chapter seven.

20:17.913 --> 20:20.348
Will you please open your
textbooks to, uh, chapter eight

20:20.349 --> 20:22.984
and we'll get started?

20:22.985 --> 20:24.486
Excuse me, what's your name?

20:24.487 --> 20:25.520
Brad.

20:25.521 --> 20:27.089
Brad, why don't you get up here

20:27.090 --> 20:28.957
in front of the class here

20:28.958 --> 20:32.327
and read conversation
number five?

20:34.863 --> 20:37.665
<i>"Les Francais sonts"</i>

20:37.666 --> 20:39.667
<i>"uh, generalement"</i>

20:39.668 --> 20:42.504
<i>"dans leur pais que..."</i>

20:42.505 --> 20:45.407
<i>"presque tout le monde</i>
<i>a cette impression..."</i>

20:45.408 --> 20:46.808
They sent for me.

20:46.809 --> 20:50.044
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

20:50.045 --> 20:52.880
I came all the way
from-from Dixon.

20:52.881 --> 20:55.683
Well, uh,
I always sub for Roberta.

20:56.084 --> 20:58.219
Excuse me,
why aren't you reading?

20:59.454 --> 21:02.689
I'll never come back to-to
Bellarmine Jefferson again!

21:02.690 --> 21:05.291
You tell them not to call me!

21:05.292 --> 21:07.728
What do they think,
it's easy for a woman my age

21:07.729 --> 21:09.863
and all the money that it costs
to travel?

21:09.864 --> 21:11.465
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.001
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale

21:13.002 --> 21:16.304
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

21:16.305 --> 21:19.474
I regret to inform you that,
for the past week

21:19.475 --> 21:23.277
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

21:24.447 --> 21:25.747
He what?

21:25.748 --> 21:29.884
Your son has been pretending
to be a substitute teacher

21:29.885 --> 21:34.256
lecturing the students,
uh, giving out homework.

21:34.257 --> 21:37.792
Mrs. Glasser has
been ill and there was

21:37.793 --> 21:40.795
some confusion
with the real sub.

21:40.796 --> 21:44.332
Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday

21:44.333 --> 21:46.768
and was planning
a class field trip

21:46.769 --> 21:49.337
to a French bread factory
in Trenton.

21:49.338 --> 21:52.940
Do you see the problem we have?

21:52.941 --> 21:54.942
Yeah.
Mrs. Davenport?

21:54.943 --> 21:57.445
Uh, I have a note to miss
fifth and sixth period today.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.480
Doctor's appointment.

21:58.481 --> 22:00.615
One moment.

22:00.616 --> 22:01.916
I'll be right with you.

22:01.917 --> 22:02.917
Hey...

22:02.918 --> 22:03.918
Yes?

22:03.919 --> 22:05.153
You should fold it.

22:05.154 --> 22:06.254
What?

22:06.255 --> 22:07.922
That note.
It's a fake, right?

22:07.923 --> 22:09.257
You should fold it.

22:09.258 --> 22:11.059
It's... It's a note
from my mom.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.794
I have a doctor's appointment.

22:12.795 --> 22:15.697
Yeah, but there's
no crease in the paper.

22:15.698 --> 22:17.765
When your mom hands
you a note to miss school

22:17.766 --> 22:19.534
the first thing you do is,
you fold it

22:19.535 --> 22:20.935
and you put it in your pocket.

22:20.936 --> 22:24.305
I mean, if it's real,
where's the crease?

22:33.849 --> 22:35.383
Frankie.

22:50.766 --> 22:52.767
Ma, I'm home.

22:54.837 --> 22:56.838
Oh, you remember
that girl Joanna

22:56.839 --> 22:59.040
I was telling you about?

22:59.041 --> 23:01.176
I asked her out today.

23:02.177 --> 23:04.546
Think we're going to go
to the Junior Prom.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.416
Ma, is this
my driver's license?

23:08.417 --> 23:10.218
That's all there is,
two bedrooms.

23:10.819 --> 23:12.621
Oh, Frankie.

23:12.622 --> 23:14.589
You remember Dad's friend?

23:14.590 --> 23:16.524
Jack Barnes?

23:16.525 --> 23:17.825
From the club.

23:17.826 --> 23:18.860
Hello.

23:18.861 --> 23:20.828
He came by looking
for your father.

23:20.829 --> 23:23.598
I was giving him
a tour of the apartment.

23:23.599 --> 23:26.835
It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

23:32.174 --> 23:34.476
Dad's at the store.

23:34.477 --> 23:37.512
So, Frank... you're
getting to look

23:37.513 --> 23:40.582
more like your
old man every day.

23:43.018 --> 23:45.453
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

23:45.454 --> 23:47.255
I'll see you later, eh?

23:47.256 --> 23:49.457
Wait.

23:53.396 --> 23:55.563
Is this yours?

23:55.564 --> 23:58.300
Oh.

23:58.301 --> 24:00.001
Well, thanks, Frank.

24:00.002 --> 24:02.370
Uh, that's the President's pin.

24:02.371 --> 24:05.006
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

24:10.879 --> 24:13.180
I'll see you all later, eh?

24:22.525 --> 24:24.693
Are you hungry, Frankie?

24:24.694 --> 24:27.294
I'll make you a sandwich.

24:35.237 --> 24:38.272
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

24:38.273 --> 24:40.408
He thinks we should
get a lawyer

24:40.409 --> 24:42.577
and sue the government.

24:43.912 --> 24:47.048
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

24:49.985 --> 24:52.186
Why aren't you saying anything?

24:58.394 --> 25:03.064
You're not going
to tell him... are you?

25:03.065 --> 25:04.833
No.

25:04.834 --> 25:06.133
That's right.

25:06.134 --> 25:08.870
There's nothing to tell.

25:08.871 --> 25:10.538
I'm going out for a few hours

25:10.539 --> 25:13.708
to visit some old friends
from the tennis club and...

25:13.709 --> 25:17.345
when I get home, we'll all
have dinner together.

25:17.346 --> 25:19.347
Right?

25:19.348 --> 25:21.416
But you won't say anything

25:21.417 --> 25:24.853
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

25:24.854 --> 25:27.055
How could we sue anybody?

25:30.826 --> 25:35.296
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

25:35.297 --> 25:39.133
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

25:39.134 --> 25:42.303
Here, take five dollars.

25:42.304 --> 25:44.505
Or-Or ten.

25:49.845 --> 25:51.846
You promised you
were going to quit.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.534
Ma, I'm home!

26:28.216 --> 26:29.784
Hey, hey!

26:29.785 --> 26:31.152
You... You stay away from me,
hear me?

26:31.153 --> 26:32.921
You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are

26:32.922 --> 26:34.188
but if you ever
come back here again...

26:34.189 --> 26:36.458
Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

26:36.459 --> 26:37.725
I'm Dick Kesner.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.928
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

26:39.929 --> 26:41.996
and follow me
into the next room, okay?

26:41.997 --> 26:43.765
They're all waiting for you.

26:46.635 --> 26:48.870
You don't have to be scared.

26:48.871 --> 26:50.905
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

26:50.906 --> 26:52.640
But there are laws.

26:52.641 --> 26:54.876
Everything in this
country has to be legal.

26:54.877 --> 26:57.912
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

26:57.913 --> 26:59.581
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

26:59.582 --> 27:01.950
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

27:01.951 --> 27:03.417
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

27:03.418 --> 27:05.086
people fighting
over their children.

27:05.087 --> 27:06.788
Nobody is fighting.

27:06.789 --> 27:09.457
Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

27:11.827 --> 27:14.128
Dad, what's going on?

27:14.129 --> 27:15.697
Dad, what's going on?

27:18.300 --> 27:19.967
Do you remember
your grandma, Eve?

27:19.968 --> 27:21.703
She arrived this morning.

27:23.138 --> 27:24.872
Hello.

27:33.014 --> 27:36.417
Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

27:37.853 --> 27:41.856
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

27:44.393 --> 27:45.626
Nothing's gonna change.

27:45.627 --> 27:47.362
We're still gonna
see each other.

27:47.363 --> 27:49.296
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

27:49.297 --> 27:51.666
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

27:51.667 --> 27:54.836
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...

27:54.837 --> 27:57.605
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

27:57.606 --> 28:00.307
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

28:00.308 --> 28:02.309
after the divorce...

28:02.310 --> 28:04.278
whose custody you will be in.

28:04.279 --> 28:07.448
And there's a blank space
right here.

28:08.450 --> 28:09.917
And I want you to go
into the kitchen

28:09.918 --> 28:11.519
sit at the table

28:11.520 --> 28:13.220
and put a name down.

28:13.221 --> 28:14.555
You can take
as long as you want

28:14.556 --> 28:16.257
but when you come back
into this room...

28:16.258 --> 28:18.893
<i>I want to see a name</i>
<i>on that line.</i>

28:18.894 --> 28:22.663
Frank, just write down a name
and this will all be over.

28:22.664 --> 28:24.565
It's gonna be okay.

28:24.566 --> 28:26.367
<i>Dad, what name?</i>

28:26.368 --> 28:27.535
Your mother or your father.

28:27.536 --> 28:29.737
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

28:29.738 --> 28:32.774
And don't look so scared.

28:32.775 --> 28:34.542
It's not a test.

28:34.543 --> 28:36.744
<i>There's no wrong answer.</i>

28:49.391 --> 28:50.391
Hi.

28:51.527 --> 28:53.093
One ticket to Grand
Central, please.

28:53.094 --> 28:56.363
That'll be $3.50, sir.

28:56.364 --> 28:59.399
Is it okay
if I write you a check?

29:04.239 --> 29:07.107
Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

29:07.108 --> 29:09.677
You can call him when
we get to New York.

29:09.678 --> 29:12.980
We leave for the airport
in seven hours.

29:12.981 --> 29:15.249
Until then, just sit there.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.018
Be quiet.

29:18.019 --> 29:20.387
You know, Carl,
on the other side of the hotel

29:20.388 --> 29:22.422
they got suites
that face the park.

29:23.358 --> 29:26.694
It's the best room
the FBI can afford.

29:28.864 --> 29:30.965
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

29:30.966 --> 29:32.333
<i>Mr. Mudrick...</i>

29:32.334 --> 29:33.668
Mr. Mudrick, please.
You have to listen.

29:33.669 --> 29:35.470
I don't want to
hear your story.

29:35.471 --> 29:37.204
This is two checks
that bounced.

29:37.205 --> 29:39.039
You know how much
trouble I'm in?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.641
No, but listen, I'm telling you

29:40.642 --> 29:41.976
the bank,
they made the mistake.

29:41.977 --> 29:43.511
I'll write you
another check right now!

29:43.512 --> 29:45.480
What, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

29:45.481 --> 29:47.348
Look, it's midnight,
Mr. Mudrick.

29:47.349 --> 29:48.349
Where am I gonna go?

29:48.350 --> 29:49.984
You're a goddamn kid.

29:49.985 --> 29:52.186
Go home.

30:39.618 --> 30:40.918
I mean, I hope you understand.

30:40.919 --> 30:42.753
My boss sent me to Brooklyn,
then Queens.

30:42.754 --> 30:44.188
Now he wants me in Long Island

30:44.189 --> 30:46.691
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

30:46.692 --> 30:48.492
I'm sorry,
but we're not allowed

30:48.493 --> 30:50.294
to cash checks
from other banks.

30:50.295 --> 30:52.563
How would we know
if they were any good?

30:52.564 --> 30:54.298
What did you say your name was?

30:54.299 --> 30:55.299
Ashley.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.600
Ashley...

30:56.601 --> 30:58.802
you know what I found on
the sidewalk out there?

31:04.075 --> 31:06.443
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

31:10.716 --> 31:14.418
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

31:14.419 --> 31:16.854
Well, you see, it's my
grandmother's birthday next week

31:16.855 --> 31:18.889
and I want to get her
something extra-special.

31:18.890 --> 31:20.591
<i>Please, I mean</i>

31:20.592 --> 31:23.060
it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

31:24.162 --> 31:26.096
Please, it's just five dollars.

31:26.097 --> 31:27.732
No one would have to know.

31:27.733 --> 31:30.368
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed

31:30.369 --> 31:33.904
to take checks
from people we don't know.

32:15.447 --> 32:17.347
Pleasure to have you back,
Captain Carlson.

32:17.348 --> 32:18.783
What do you think, Angelo?

32:18.784 --> 32:20.418
The tomatoes are ripe
this afternoon.

32:28.359 --> 32:29.527
Well, what have we here?

32:29.528 --> 32:31.562
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.

32:31.563 --> 32:33.597
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?

32:33.598 --> 32:35.766
- Mm-hmm!
- All right, then.

32:35.767 --> 32:37.301
There you go.
Work hard in school.

32:37.302 --> 32:38.669
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

32:38.670 --> 32:41.271
<i>I have decided to become</i>
<i>an airline pilot.</i>

32:41.272 --> 32:43.641
<i>I have applied</i>
<i>to all the big airlines</i>

32:43.642 --> 32:46.744
<i>and I have several</i>
<i>promising interviews lined up.</i>

32:46.745 --> 32:48.512
<i>How's Mom?</i>

32:48.513 --> 32:50.514
<i>Have you called her lately?</i>

32:50.515 --> 32:52.783
<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>

32:55.954 --> 32:57.788
Hello.

32:57.789 --> 33:00.157
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

33:00.158 --> 33:02.760
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

33:02.761 --> 33:04.061
You're the young man

33:04.062 --> 33:05.996
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

33:05.997 --> 33:07.498
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

33:07.499 --> 33:09.500
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

33:09.501 --> 33:11.201
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

33:11.202 --> 33:12.903
What does a pilot
make in a year?

33:12.904 --> 33:15.272
And who tells them where
they're gonna fly to?

33:15.273 --> 33:16.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

33:16.475 --> 33:17.708
Just take 'em one at a time.

33:17.709 --> 33:18.876
All right.
What does it mean

33:18.877 --> 33:20.478
when one pilot says
to another pilot,

33:20.479 --> 33:22.045
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

33:22.046 --> 33:24.582
They just want to know what
kind of aircraft you're flying,

33:24.583 --> 33:26.016
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

33:26.017 --> 33:28.686
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

33:28.687 --> 33:31.489
Well, every pilot has to have two
things with him at all times,

33:31.490 --> 33:33.123
One is his airline
personnel badge...

33:33.124 --> 33:35.125
looks just like this
one here, from Pan Am...

33:35.126 --> 33:37.761
the other one is
their FAA license...

33:37.762 --> 33:40.130
and that looks just like this.

33:40.131 --> 33:42.265
Oh. Sir, do you
think I can

33:42.266 --> 33:45.736
make a copy of this
to put into my article?

33:45.737 --> 33:47.538
Oh, Frank, you can
have that one.

33:47.539 --> 33:48.939
It's three years expired.

33:48.940 --> 33:50.541
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. badge?

33:50.542 --> 33:52.075
You have an extra
one I could borrow?

33:52.076 --> 33:54.077
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

33:54.078 --> 33:56.046
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

33:56.047 --> 33:57.548
The only way
to get one of those

33:57.549 --> 34:00.217
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

34:04.990 --> 34:06.624
Pan Am, may I help you?

34:06.625 --> 34:08.091
Yeah, hello.

34:08.092 --> 34:09.159
I'm calling about a uniform.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.928
Hold for Purchasing.

34:10.929 --> 34:11.929
Thank you.

34:11.929 --> 34:13.295
Purchasing.

34:13.297 --> 34:15.297
Hi. I'm a copilot

34:15.299 --> 34:16.600
based out of San Francisco.

34:16.601 --> 34:18.502
I flew a flight
into New York last night

34:18.503 --> 34:19.536
but the problem is

34:19.538 --> 34:21.170
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

34:21.172 --> 34:23.040
How can we help you?

34:23.041 --> 34:26.109
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

34:26.110 --> 34:28.646
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

34:28.647 --> 34:31.181
<i>They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.</i>

34:31.181 --> 34:33.216
<i>Go down to the Well-Built</i>
<i>Uniform Company</i>

34:33.217 --> 34:34.317
<i>at Ninth and Broadway.</i>

34:34.318 --> 34:35.786
<i>They're our uniform supplier.</i>

34:35.786 --> 34:37.487
<i>I'll tell Mr. Rosen</i>
<i>you're coming.</i>

34:37.487 --> 34:39.723
You look too
young to be a pilot.

34:39.724 --> 34:41.491
I'm a copilot.

34:41.492 --> 34:43.159
Why so nervous?

34:43.161 --> 34:44.995
How would you feel if you, uh

34:44.996 --> 34:47.598
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

34:47.599 --> 34:49.232
Relax.

34:49.233 --> 34:51.802
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.

34:51.803 --> 34:54.103
It's gonna be $164.

34:54.105 --> 34:56.440
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll write you a check.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.542
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

34:58.543 --> 35:00.711
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number

35:00.712 --> 35:01.845
and then I'll bill Pan Am.

35:01.846 --> 35:03.981
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

35:05.951 --> 35:07.851
Even better.

35:09.621 --> 35:11.622
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

35:11.623 --> 35:14.558
<i>You always told me that an</i>
<i>honest man has nothing to fear.</i>

35:14.559 --> 35:16.594
<i>So I'm trying my best</i>
<i>not to be afraid.</i>

35:16.595 --> 35:21.131
<i>I'm sorry I ran away,</i>
<i>but you don't have to worry.</i>

35:21.132 --> 35:23.266
<i>I'm gonna get it all back</i>
<i>now, Daddy.</i>

35:23.267 --> 35:25.636
<i>I promise.</i>
<i>I'm going to get it all back.</i>

35:31.375 --> 35:33.443
Are you a real live pilot?

35:33.444 --> 35:35.613
I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

35:35.614 --> 35:36.614
Celine.

35:36.615 --> 35:38.548
Celine, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

35:38.549 --> 35:40.818
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

35:44.222 --> 35:47.024
That's fifty, seventy

35:47.025 --> 35:50.961
eighty, ninety,
one hundred dollars.

35:50.962 --> 35:52.896
You have yourself a
great time in Paris.

35:52.897 --> 35:54.531
I always do.

35:54.532 --> 35:57.518
Excuse me.

35:57.519 --> 35:59.220
I'm John Modiger.
I manage this branch.

35:59.221 --> 36:00.654
I want to thank you
for coming in

36:00.655 --> 36:01.788
and using our institution.

36:01.789 --> 36:03.557
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, John.

36:03.558 --> 36:04.558
I'll be back again.

36:04.559 --> 36:05.826
Good.

36:05.827 --> 36:07.461
Have you stayed with us before?

36:07.462 --> 36:10.831
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

36:10.832 --> 36:14.235
Is it all right if I write
you a check for the room?

36:14.236 --> 36:15.336
No problem, sir.

36:15.337 --> 36:17.538
Great.

36:24.796 --> 36:25.846
Uh...

36:25.847 --> 36:26.914
I was also wondering

36:26.915 --> 36:28.815
if I could write you
a personal check?

36:28.816 --> 36:32.319
For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.521
Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

36:35.723 --> 36:38.526
Did you say $300
for a payroll check?

36:43.131 --> 36:45.533
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

36:45.534 --> 36:48.135
<i>I've decided to become a pilot</i>
<i>for Pan American Airways...</i>

36:48.136 --> 36:51.572
<i>the most trusted name</i>
<i>in the skies.</i>

36:51.573 --> 36:54.275
<i>They've accepted me</i>
<i>into their training program</i>

36:54.276 --> 36:56.277
<i>and told me that if I work hard.</i>

36:56.278 --> 36:57.711
<i>I should earn my wings</i>
<i>real soon.</i>

36:57.712 --> 37:00.414
<i>Please get in touch with Joanna</i>
<i>Carlton from the tenth grade.</i>

37:00.415 --> 37:03.817
<i>Tell her I'm sorry that I could</i>
<i>not take her to the Junior Prom.</i>

37:03.818 --> 37:06.019
<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>

37:44.692 --> 37:45.826
Hello, how are you?

37:45.827 --> 37:46.994
Fine, thank you.

37:46.995 --> 37:48.996
I have a payroll check here
I'd like to cash.

37:48.997 --> 37:50.664
Certainly.

37:50.665 --> 37:51.865
Thank you.

37:53.418 --> 37:54.768
Uh, excuse me.

37:54.769 --> 37:56.703
I'm sure you hear this
all the time

37:56.704 --> 37:59.206
but you have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

38:00.742 --> 38:02.276
Yeah, I do get
that all the time.

38:04.279 --> 38:06.112
How would you like it?

38:20.795 --> 38:22.163
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

38:22.164 --> 38:26.099
We won't have any cash until
the banks open in an hour

38:26.100 --> 38:27.368
but, uh, I'm sure

38:27.369 --> 38:30.103
they can cash your
check at the airport.

38:30.104 --> 38:31.639
The airport?

38:31.640 --> 38:34.041
Who cashes checks
at the airport?

38:34.042 --> 38:35.108
Well, the airlines, sir.

38:35.109 --> 38:37.611
They've always taken
care of their own.

38:46.087 --> 38:47.188
Hello.

38:47.189 --> 38:48.855
Hi. Are you deadheading?

38:48.856 --> 38:50.624
What?

38:50.625 --> 38:52.626
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

38:52.627 --> 38:55.028
Mi...?

38:55.029 --> 38:56.397
Yes, yes.

38:57.566 --> 38:59.966
Yeah, I'm the deadhead.
Here you go.

38:59.967 --> 39:03.737
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

39:05.207 --> 39:06.207
You know

39:06.208 --> 39:07.908
it's been awhile
since I've done this.

39:07.909 --> 39:09.310
Which one's the
jump seat again?

39:11.813 --> 39:13.480
Have a nice flight.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.916
Are you my deadhead?

39:18.019 --> 39:19.920
Frank, Captain Oliver.

39:19.921 --> 39:21.589
Hello.
John Larkin, the copilot.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.756
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

39:22.757 --> 39:23.924
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.

39:23.925 --> 39:25.792
Thanks for giving me
a lift, boys.

39:25.793 --> 39:27.595
Go ahead and take
a seat, Frank.

39:27.596 --> 39:28.762
We're about to push.

39:28.763 --> 39:31.064
What kind of
equipment you on, DC-8?

39:31.065 --> 39:32.766
Uh, 707.

39:32.767 --> 39:35.502
You turning around
on the redeye?

39:35.503 --> 39:37.638
Uh, I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months

39:37.639 --> 39:39.506
trying to earn my keep
running leapfrogs

39:39.507 --> 39:40.708
for the weak and weary.

39:40.709 --> 39:43.944
No shame in that.
We all did it.

39:50.252 --> 39:51.285
Have a seat.

39:51.286 --> 39:52.586
Thank you.

39:53.388 --> 39:55.756
Would you like a drink
after takeoff?

39:55.757 --> 39:57.658
M-Milk?

39:57.659 --> 39:58.859
80 knots.

39:58.860 --> 39:59.960
Check.

39:59.961 --> 40:01.428
V-one. Rotate.

40:04.432 --> 40:06.467
V-two. Positive rate.

40:06.468 --> 40:08.769
Gear up.

40:08.770 --> 40:10.203
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

40:10.204 --> 40:11.672
<i>Today was graduation.</i>

40:11.673 --> 40:13.374
<i>I am now a copilot</i>

40:13.375 --> 40:16.677
<i>earning $1,400 a month</i>
<i>plus benefits</i>

40:16.678 --> 40:18.712
<i>and the best part is</i>

<i>they tell me</i>
<i>my family can fly for free.</i>

40:20.982 --> 40:24.318
<i>So tell Mom to pack her bags</i>
<i>and buy a new swimsuit</i>

40:24.319 --> 40:27.588
<i>because I'm taking us all</i>

40:27.589 --> 40:28.955
<i>I love you, Dad.</i>

40:28.956 --> 40:31.024
<i>Aloha, Frank.</i>

40:31.025 --> 40:32.660
Hello, deadhead.

40:32.661 --> 40:33.661
Hello.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.496
Enjoying your free ride?

40:41.202 --> 40:43.870
Marci...

40:43.871 --> 40:46.072
did you drop this?

40:48.777 --> 40:50.311
Must've slipped
right off your neck.

40:50.312 --> 40:51.679
No...

40:53.348 --> 40:55.382
No!

40:55.383 --> 40:57.083
No...

40:57.084 --> 40:59.787
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

41:02.357 --> 41:03.557
Yes!

41:06.528 --> 41:10.564
Why are you stopping?

41:10.565 --> 41:14.000
I want to tell you
something, Marci.

41:14.001 --> 41:17.805
This is by far...

41:17.806 --> 41:22.443
the best date I
have ever been on.

41:42.029 --> 41:44.197
I'd like to open
a Money Market, please.

41:44.198 --> 41:46.399
Okay.

41:52.306 --> 41:56.176
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

41:56.177 --> 41:59.580
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

41:59.581 --> 42:02.449
I'd like to cash this check
here, and then

42:02.450 --> 42:05.652
I'd like to take you out
for a steak dinner.

42:15.630 --> 42:17.731
And then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine

42:17.732 --> 42:19.032
which uses special ink

42:19.033 --> 42:20.267
to encode the account numbers

42:20.268 --> 42:21.702
on the bottom of the checks.

42:23.371 --> 42:25.939
And where are these numbers?

42:25.940 --> 42:28.208
They're, um...
right here.

42:28.209 --> 42:29.576
Right there?

42:29.577 --> 42:30.744
See?

42:33.147 --> 42:35.215
They're called routing numbers.

42:35.216 --> 42:37.618
So where do the checks
get routed to?

42:38.453 --> 42:40.821
You know, I don't exactly know.

42:40.822 --> 42:42.389
Nobody ever asked
me that before.

42:44.125 --> 42:45.793
Our next item up for bid

42:45.794 --> 42:48.128
is also from the Jersey
Central Bank foreclosure.

42:48.129 --> 42:49.329
This is a MICR encoder

42:49.330 --> 42:51.031
a machine used
to encode bank checks.

42:51.032 --> 42:52.332
Do I have an opening bid?

42:52.333 --> 42:54.367
<i>Our unknown
subject is a paperhanger</i>

42:54.368 --> 42:56.136
<i>who started working</i>
<i>on the East Coast.</i>

42:56.137 --> 42:58.305
<i>In the last few weeks,</i>
<i>this unsub has developed</i>

42:58.306 --> 43:00.874
<i>a new form of check fraud</i>
<i>which I'm calling "the float."</i>

43:00.875 --> 43:01.975
What he's doing is

43:01.976 --> 43:04.044
he's opening checking accounts
at various banks

43:04.045 --> 43:05.913
then changing the MICR ink
routing numbers

43:05.914 --> 43:07.280
at the bottom of those checks.

43:07.281 --> 43:08.482
Next slide, please.

43:09.751 --> 43:11.718
Next slide, please.

43:11.719 --> 43:13.219
Uh, the remote thing is broken.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.655
You'll have to do it by hand.

43:14.656 --> 43:15.923
You've gotta...
try the...

43:15.924 --> 43:17.324
Agent Mullen, it should be...

43:17.325 --> 43:20.026
it should be the square button
just there by the side.

43:20.027 --> 43:21.227
This carousel doesn't work.

43:21.228 --> 43:22.729
It's a bad carousel
you got there.

43:22.730 --> 43:23.797
Thank you, Agent Mullen.

43:23.798 --> 43:25.031
Got to move it manually.

43:25.032 --> 43:27.568
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

43:27.569 --> 43:29.570
Slide.

43:30.705 --> 43:32.172
MICR scanners at every bank

43:32.173 --> 43:34.641
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check...

43:34.642 --> 43:35.909
slide...

43:35.910 --> 43:39.212
and then, ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

43:39.213 --> 43:41.982
Carl, for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud

43:41.983 --> 43:44.284
you mind telling us
what the hell

43:44.285 --> 43:45.786
you're talking about?

43:45.787 --> 43:49.756
The East Coast branches are
numbered zero-one to zero-six.

43:49.757 --> 43:51.825
The central branch
is zero-seven, zero-eight

43:51.826 --> 43:52.960
so on, so forth.

43:52.961 --> 43:54.595
You mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check

43:54.596 --> 43:55.596
actually mean something?

43:55.597 --> 43:56.597
All of this was in the report

43:56.598 --> 43:58.131
I filed two days ago.

43:58.132 --> 44:02.335
If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

44:02.336 --> 44:05.205
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

44:05.206 --> 44:06.874
does not go to the New York
Federal Branch

44:06.875 --> 44:08.108
but it is rerouted

44:08.109 --> 44:11.411
all the way to the San Francisco
Federal Branch.

44:11.412 --> 44:14.280
The bank doesn't even know the
check has bounced for two weeks

44:14.281 --> 44:16.282
which means our unsub
can stay in one place

44:16.283 --> 44:17.985
paper the same city
over and over again

44:17.986 --> 44:19.820
while his checks
circle the country.

44:19.821 --> 44:22.923
You know, you want
to talk to my wife.

44:22.924 --> 44:25.592
She's the one balances
the checkbook at our house.

44:30.297 --> 44:32.632
Next slide.

44:38.305 --> 44:39.639
Daddy!

44:42.443 --> 44:44.444
My son, the birdman.

44:44.445 --> 44:45.479
Some uniform, Frank.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.481
What do you think?

44:47.482 --> 44:49.148
Nice.

44:49.149 --> 44:50.817
Sit down.

44:53.821 --> 44:55.989
So, Dad... Daddy, have you
gotten the postcards?

44:55.990 --> 44:57.323
Of course.

44:57.324 --> 44:59.626
This fork is ice cold.

44:59.627 --> 45:03.296
No, no, Dad, th-that's
a chilled salad fork.

45:03.297 --> 45:07.967
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

45:11.338 --> 45:13.774
Well, here...

45:13.775 --> 45:15.709
I-I got you something.

45:15.710 --> 45:17.444
What's that?

45:17.445 --> 45:19.646
Open it.

45:23.451 --> 45:25.285
You know what those are, right?

45:25.286 --> 45:27.287
Those are the keys

45:27.288 --> 45:30.290
to a 1965 Cadillac
DeVille convertible.

45:30.291 --> 45:32.192
Brand-new, Dad.

45:32.193 --> 45:35.129
Red with white interior

45:35.130 --> 45:39.299
split seats,
air conditioning, the works.

45:39.300 --> 45:40.567
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

45:40.568 --> 45:42.302
Yeah. I'm giving you
a Cadillac.

45:42.303 --> 45:44.071
Dad, sh-she's parked
downstairs.

45:44.072 --> 45:45.639
When we're done eating lunch

45:45.640 --> 45:48.541
why don't you, you know,
drive on over to Mom's house

45:48.542 --> 45:50.710
pick her up,
take a little joyride?

45:50.711 --> 45:52.512
Do you know what would happen

45:52.513 --> 45:53.814
if the IRS found out

45:53.815 --> 45:57.317
I was driving around
in a new coupe?

45:57.318 --> 45:59.619
I took the train here, Frank.

45:59.620 --> 46:01.989
I'm taking the train home.

46:03.658 --> 46:05.692
All right.

46:10.698 --> 46:13.801
I have plenty of money.

46:13.802 --> 46:16.203
You know, if you
ever, ever need anything...

46:16.204 --> 46:17.537
You worried?

46:17.538 --> 46:20.073
About me?

46:20.074 --> 46:21.708
No, I'm not...
I'm not worried.

46:21.709 --> 46:24.145
You think I can't
buy my own car?

46:24.146 --> 46:28.715
Two mice fell in a
bucket of cream, Frank.

46:28.716 --> 46:30.583
Which one am I?

46:30.584 --> 46:33.453
You're that second mouse.

46:35.089 --> 46:38.725
I went by the store today.

46:38.726 --> 46:40.694
I had to close the
store for awhile.

46:40.695 --> 46:42.262
It's all about timing, Frank.

46:42.263 --> 46:43.864
The goddamn government
knows that.

46:43.865 --> 46:45.465
They hit you when you're down.

46:45.466 --> 46:46.834
I wasn't going to let them

46:46.835 --> 46:48.401
take it from me, so I just...

46:48.402 --> 46:51.505
shut the doors myself,
called their bluff.

46:56.077 --> 46:58.245
Sooner or later,
they'll forget about me.

46:58.246 --> 47:00.680
I understand, I...

47:00.681 --> 47:04.084
Have you told Ma?

47:05.753 --> 47:10.290
She's so stubborn, your mother.

47:12.927 --> 47:14.261
Don't worry.

47:14.262 --> 47:16.629
I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

47:16.630 --> 47:17.865
I been fighting for us...

47:20.601 --> 47:22.302
Dad?

47:24.438 --> 47:27.040
Since the day we... we met.

47:27.041 --> 47:28.909
Daddy, out of all those men

47:28.910 --> 47:32.379
you were the one that
took her home, remember that.

47:32.380 --> 47:35.815
200 men, sitting in
that tiny social hall

47:35.816 --> 47:38.017
watching her dance.

47:40.288 --> 47:42.789
What was the name of that town?

47:42.790 --> 47:44.124
Montrichard, Dad.

47:44.125 --> 47:45.625
Yeah.

47:45.626 --> 47:48.461
I didn't speak a word of French

47:48.462 --> 47:51.932
and six weeks later,
she was my wi...

47:51.933 --> 47:54.935
She's your wife.

47:54.936 --> 47:59.206
My son bought me
a Cadillac today.

47:59.207 --> 48:03.243
I think that calls for a toast.

48:10.818 --> 48:14.154
To the best damn pilot
in the sky.

48:14.155 --> 48:15.855
It's not what you think.

48:15.856 --> 48:18.525
I'm just a copilot.

48:18.526 --> 48:22.195
You see these people
staring at you?

48:25.333 --> 48:27.167
These are the most
powerful people

48:27.168 --> 48:28.802
in New York City

48:28.803 --> 48:31.071
and they keep peeking
over their shoulders

48:31.072 --> 48:33.073
wondering where
you're going tonight.

48:33.074 --> 48:34.541
Where you going, Frank?

48:34.542 --> 48:38.245
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

48:38.246 --> 48:40.614
Some place exotic?

48:42.516 --> 48:45.352
Just tell me where you're going.

48:46.887 --> 48:49.256
Los An... Hollywood.

48:49.257 --> 48:51.924
Hollywood.

48:56.697 --> 48:58.865
The rest of us...

48:58.866 --> 49:01.734
really are suckers.

49:06.540 --> 49:09.176
So, I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

49:09.177 --> 49:10.978
And I got a bra,
like, out here, okay?

49:10.979 --> 49:13.046
And I'm chasing
these two Puerto Rican guys

49:13.047 --> 49:14.381
through the park.

49:14.382 --> 49:16.716
They got a suitcase filled
with bank robbery loot.

49:16.717 --> 49:18.551
Okay, I'm screaming out,
"FBI, freeze!"

49:18.552 --> 49:21.388
And I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

49:21.389 --> 49:22.389
It's so damn big

49:22.390 --> 49:25.058
I thought I was going
to shoot my tits off.

49:27.728 --> 49:29.262
You know, that's a funny story.

49:29.263 --> 49:30.964
People always laugh
at that story.

49:30.965 --> 49:32.932
Let me ask you a
question, Mr. Amdursky.

49:32.933 --> 49:34.968
If you were having so
much fun undercover

49:34.969 --> 49:36.736
why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

49:36.737 --> 49:37.737
I didn't transfer.

49:37.738 --> 49:39.339
I was censured and reassigned.

49:39.340 --> 49:41.741
It's like being punished.
I was punished.

49:41.742 --> 49:43.743
I screwed up in the field.

49:43.744 --> 49:44.878
What about you,
Mr. Fox?

49:44.879 --> 49:47.381
Were you... punished for
screwing up in the field?

49:47.382 --> 49:50.083
Oh, no, no, no, I've never
worked in the field before.

49:50.084 --> 49:51.751
I audited
background investigations

49:51.752 --> 49:53.920
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

49:53.921 --> 49:55.255
Well, that's just great.

49:55.256 --> 49:56.589
I ask for a team

49:56.590 --> 49:58.691
and they drag the
bottom of the Pacific.

49:58.692 --> 50:01.294
You mind if I ask you
a question, Agent Hanratty?

50:01.295 --> 50:03.430
How come you're so serious
all the time?

50:03.431 --> 50:05.765
Does it bother you,
Mr. Amdursky?

50:05.766 --> 50:08.368
Yeah. Yeah,
it does bother me.

50:08.369 --> 50:10.837
Does it bother
you, Mr. Fox?

50:10.838 --> 50:12.472
A little, I guess.

50:12.473 --> 50:16.276
Well, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

50:16.277 --> 50:20.213
Yeah. Yeah, we'd love
to hear a joke from you.

50:20.214 --> 50:23.283
Knock, knock.

50:23.284 --> 50:25.151
Who's there?

50:27.121 --> 50:30.257
Go fuck yourselves.

51:25.513 --> 51:26.513
Yeah, it's Frank.

Hey, Frank, how are you?

51:30.251 --> 51:32.252

this guy's a pen and ink man.

51:36.690 --> 51:37.690
A goddamn paperhanger.

51:37.691 --> 51:38.858
He doesn't even carry a gun.

51:38.859 --> 51:40.093
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

51:40.094 --> 51:41.861
You just keep your
eyes open, do your job

51:41.862 --> 51:44.364
and I'll buy you both
a Good Humor bar.

51:53.707 --> 51:54.874
It's all right, ma'am.
FBI.

51:58.212 --> 52:01.214
201... 201, 201.

52:01.215 --> 52:02.982
201...

52:02.983 --> 52:04.984
201... 201...

52:04.985 --> 52:08.388
201... 201...

52:12.293 --> 52:14.060
FBI!

52:22.903 --> 52:24.638
FBI!

52:24.639 --> 52:27.740
Come out of the bathroom!

52:27.741 --> 52:30.109
Step out of the bathroom!

52:33.814 --> 52:34.914
Hands on your head.

52:34.915 --> 52:36.316
Oh, that's the new
IBM Selectric.

52:36.317 --> 52:37.484
Put your hands on your head.

52:37.485 --> 52:37.958
Shut up!

52:37.983 --> 52:39.852
You can change the print
type in five seconds.

52:39.853 --> 52:40.853
Just pop out the ball.

52:40.854 --> 52:42.855
Put your hands on your head!
Put your hands...!

52:42.856 --> 52:44.491
You know, he's got
over 200 checks here.

52:44.492 --> 52:46.693
- Hands on your head!
- A gallon of India ink, drafting.

52:46.694 --> 52:48.361
Put it down.
Even has little payroll envelopes...

52:48.362 --> 52:49.563
addressed to himself
from Pan Am.

52:49.564 --> 52:50.564
Put it down!
Drop it!

52:50.565 --> 52:51.631
Relax.

52:51.632 --> 52:52.965
You're late, all right?

52:52.966 --> 52:54.434
My name's Allen, Barry Allen.

52:54.435 --> 52:56.069
United States Secret Service.

52:56.070 --> 52:58.405
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

52:58.406 --> 52:59.739
My partner has him
in custody downstairs.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.040
I don't know what
you're talking about.

53:01.041 --> 53:04.277
You think the FBI
are the only ones on this guy?

53:04.278 --> 53:05.412
I mean, come on.

53:05.413 --> 53:07.581
Come on, he's dabbling
in government checks here.

53:07.582 --> 53:09.649
We've been following
a paper trail on this guy

53:09.650 --> 53:11.184
for months now.

53:11.185 --> 53:13.253
Hey, you mind taking that gun
out of my face?

53:13.254 --> 53:14.387
Please. Really.

53:14.388 --> 53:15.988
I mean, it makes me nervous.

53:15.989 --> 53:17.924
Let me see some credentials.

53:17.925 --> 53:21.160
Yeah, sure.

53:21.161 --> 53:22.662
Take my whole wallet.

53:24.164 --> 53:25.432
You want my gun, too?

53:25.433 --> 53:27.100
Come over here.
Take my gun.

53:27.101 --> 53:29.168
Hey, hey, look,
just do me a favor.

53:29.169 --> 53:30.770
Take a look outside. Look.

53:30.771 --> 53:31.771
Look out the window.

53:31.772 --> 53:33.306
My partner's walking
him to the car

53:33.307 --> 53:34.507
as we speak... Look.

53:36.844 --> 53:39.112
Old guy almost
pissed in his pants

53:39.113 --> 53:40.913
when I came through the door.

53:40.914 --> 53:42.716
He jumped right
through the window

53:42.717 --> 53:44.050
onto the hood of my car.

53:44.051 --> 53:46.085
Hey, Murph?

53:46.086 --> 53:47.887
- Yeah?
- Call the LAPD again.

53:47.888 --> 53:50.357
I don't want people walking
through my crime scene.

53:52.526 --> 53:55.027
I didn't expect the
Secret Service on this.

53:55.028 --> 53:56.195
Don't worry about it.

53:57.365 --> 53:58.698
Well, what's your name?

53:58.699 --> 54:02.201
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

54:05.806 --> 54:08.441
Mind if I see
some identification?

54:08.442 --> 54:10.042
Sure.

54:10.043 --> 54:13.546
You never can be
too careful these days.

54:13.547 --> 54:14.714
Well, tough luck, Carl.

54:14.715 --> 54:15.882
Five minutes earlier

54:15.883 --> 54:18.385
you would've landed yourself
a pretty good collar.

54:18.386 --> 54:19.586
It's all right.

54:19.587 --> 54:21.621
Ten seconds later, and
you'd have been shot.

54:21.622 --> 54:23.990
Mind if I come
downstairs with you?

54:23.991 --> 54:26.293
I-I got to take a
look at this guy.

54:26.294 --> 54:27.294
Sure thing.

54:27.295 --> 54:28.295
Just, uh, do me a favor

54:28.296 --> 54:29.396
and sit tight for a second

54:29.397 --> 54:30.897
while I get
this evidence downstairs.

54:30.898 --> 54:33.065
You know, I don't want
some maid walking through here

54:33.066 --> 54:34.066
and making the bed.

54:34.067 --> 54:35.134
LAPD should be here any sec.

54:35.135 --> 54:36.335
Wait.

54:40.408 --> 54:42.742
Your wallet.

54:42.743 --> 54:44.577
You hang onto it for a minute.

54:44.578 --> 54:46.779
I trust you.

54:57.591 --> 54:58.758
Oh...

55:02.596 --> 55:05.097
Yeah...

55:05.098 --> 55:07.299
Secret Service.

55:48.709 --> 55:50.943
Hey!

55:50.944 --> 55:53.112
Oh, goddamn it!

55:53.113 --> 55:55.648
It was stupid.

55:55.649 --> 55:57.149
I made a stupid mistake.

55:57.150 --> 55:59.151
Forget about it.

55:59.152 --> 56:01.654
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

56:01.655 --> 56:03.022
I-I can get this guy, Sean.

56:03.023 --> 56:05.324
The worst thing
a paperhanger can do

56:05.325 --> 56:06.426
is show his face.

56:06.427 --> 56:07.627
I read the report.

56:07.628 --> 56:09.996
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age

56:09.997 --> 56:11.163
160 pounds.

56:11.164 --> 56:12.532
This could be almost anybody.

56:12.533 --> 56:14.801
I heard his voice, Sean,
I saw his face.

56:14.802 --> 56:17.537
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

56:17.538 --> 56:20.006
Just be careful.

56:20.007 --> 56:21.674
You got 12 years in.

56:21.675 --> 56:23.543
Nobody bothers you
down on the first floor.

56:23.544 --> 56:25.545
You practically
wrote the book on bank fraud.

56:25.546 --> 56:27.046
That's the kind of thing

56:27.047 --> 56:29.048
that can make you
section chief someday.

56:29.049 --> 56:32.685
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

56:32.686 --> 56:34.086
What type of position?

56:34.087 --> 56:38.825
Position of being humiliated.

56:46.534 --> 56:49.335
Sean, would you like
to hear me tell a joke?

56:49.336 --> 56:52.271
Yeah, sure.

56:52.272 --> 56:55.574
Knock, knock!

56:56.944 --> 57:00.780
So, my-my next question
is, when a pilot retires

57:00.781 --> 57:04.383
uh, Pan Am sends them
a check every single month?

57:04.384 --> 57:08.254
Uh, yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

57:08.255 --> 57:09.856
How much is that check for?

57:09.857 --> 57:11.458
Uh, kid, I'm really
not in the mood

57:11.459 --> 57:12.459
for this right now.

57:12.460 --> 57:13.960
This Skywayman's
driving me crazy.

57:13.961 --> 57:15.361
Who's the Skywayman?

57:15.362 --> 57:17.363
Ah, some nut that's
flying around the country

57:17.364 --> 57:18.631
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

57:18.632 --> 57:22.702
There's a column about
him in the paper today.

57:27.307 --> 57:29.976
I keep telling them
this is not my problem.

57:29.977 --> 57:32.011
This guy
doesn't even fly Pan Am.

57:32.012 --> 57:33.346
Flies everybody else.

57:33.347 --> 57:35.982
Flies United, TWA,
Continental, Eastern...

57:35.983 --> 57:38.485
The Skywayman.

57:38.486 --> 57:40.820
Newspaper loves this clown.

57:40.821 --> 57:44.223
They call him
"the James Bond of the sky."

57:46.994 --> 57:48.060
Did you say...?

57:48.061 --> 57:49.896
Bond, James Bond.

57:58.839 --> 58:01.841
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

58:01.842 --> 58:03.175
He likes to win.

58:03.176 --> 58:04.443
Come on, come on.

58:04.444 --> 58:05.645
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

58:05.646 --> 58:08.481
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

58:08.482 --> 58:10.483
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

58:10.484 --> 58:13.853
Well, Pussy, you do know a lot
more about planes than guns.

58:13.854 --> 58:16.088
Hello, Pussy.

58:16.089 --> 58:19.358
Now,
you're sure this is the suit, right?

58:19.359 --> 58:20.527
Positive.

58:20.528 --> 58:22.361
It's the exact suit
he wore in the movie.

58:22.362 --> 58:24.363
Okay. I'll take three.

58:24.364 --> 58:25.965
Certainly,
Mr. Fleming.

58:25.966 --> 58:28.334
Now what you need
is one of those

58:28.335 --> 58:31.370
little foreign sports cars
that he drives.

Wait a second.
Where are you going?

01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:22.935
I'm going downstairs

01:02:22.936 --> 01:02:24.103
to cash a check.

01:02:24.104 --> 01:02:27.140
You think this hotel is going
to cash a $1,000 check

01:02:27.141 --> 01:02:29.342
at 3:00am?

01:02:32.179 --> 01:02:34.113
It's a New York
Savings and Loan check.

01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:35.281
It's like gold.

01:02:35.282 --> 01:02:36.382
They'll cash it.

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:38.151
Don't you think they might get

01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:39.351
a little suspicious?

01:02:39.352 --> 01:02:40.352
Let me see that.

01:02:40.353 --> 01:02:42.588
It's a cashier's check.

01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:44.791
Endorse it over to me.

01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.692
No. I couldn't do that.

01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:49.128
See, this check is for $1,400.

01:02:49.129 --> 01:02:51.730
We agreed upon $1,000.

01:02:51.731 --> 01:02:55.201
Why don't I give you back $400

Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:04:00.868 --> 01:04:03.569
I've been trying
to track you down now

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.671
for the last couple of hours.

01:04:05.672 --> 01:04:06.906
What do you want?

01:04:06.907 --> 01:04:09.708
I wanted to apologize
for what happened

01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:11.878
out in Los Angeles.

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:13.045
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

01:04:13.046 --> 01:04:15.147
No, no,
you don't apologize to me.

01:04:15.148 --> 01:04:17.783
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

01:04:17.784 --> 01:04:19.385
I volunteered

01:04:19.386 --> 01:04:22.388
so men with families
could go home early.

01:04:22.389 --> 01:04:24.523
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring

01:04:24.524 --> 01:04:25.591
out in Los Angeles.

01:04:25.592 --> 01:04:27.260
I thought maybe
you had a family.

01:04:27.261 --> 01:04:30.729
No. No family.

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.731
You want to talk to me...

01:04:32.732 --> 01:04:34.700
let's talk face-to-face.

01:04:34.701 --> 01:04:36.135
All right.

01:04:36.136 --> 01:04:40.172
I'm at my suite at the
Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:44.343
In the morning, I leave
for Las Vegas for the weekend.

01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:48.414
You think you're going
to get me again?

01:04:48.415 --> 01:04:50.182
You're not going to Vegas.

01:04:50.183 --> 01:04:52.218
You're not
in the Stuyvesant Arms.

01:04:52.219 --> 01:04:53.886
You'd love for me

01:04:53.887 --> 01:04:56.289
to send out 20 agents
Christmas Eve

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:59.091
we barge into your hotel,
knock down the door

01:04:59.092 --> 01:05:01.327
so you can make fools
out of us all.

01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:03.762
I'm really sorry
if I made a fool out of you.

01:05:03.763 --> 01:05:04.931
I really am.

01:05:04.932 --> 01:05:05.964
Uh-uh, no.

01:05:05.965 --> 01:05:07.333
No, listen, I really am.

01:05:07.334 --> 01:05:09.701
No, no, you-you do not
feel sorry for me.

01:05:09.702 --> 01:05:11.537
The truth is,
I knew it was you.

01:05:11.538 --> 01:05:14.756
Now maybe I didn't get the cuffs
on you, but I knew.

01:05:14.757 --> 01:05:18.777
Ah, people only know
what you tell them, Carl.

01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:22.348
Well, then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:25.684
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

01:05:25.685 --> 01:05:28.354
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

01:05:28.355 --> 01:05:31.523
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

01:05:31.524 --> 01:05:34.860
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:37.063
No one ever bets
on the uniform.

01:05:38.332 --> 01:05:40.166
You sure about that, Carl?

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:42.435
I'll tell you what I <i>am</i> sure of.

01:05:42.436 --> 01:05:44.370
You're going to get caught.

01:05:44.371 --> 01:05:47.506
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact.

01:05:47.507 --> 01:05:49.008
It's-It's like Vegas.

01:05:49.009 --> 01:05:52.110
The House always wins.

01:05:55.982 --> 01:05:59.851
Well, Carl, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

01:05:59.852 --> 01:06:02.821
Ah. You didn't call
just to apologize, did you?

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.358
What do you mean?

01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:09.428
You... you...
you have no one else to call.

01:06:12.532 --> 01:06:14.166

Barry Allen.

The Flash.

01:07:18.298 --> 01:07:19.331
Yeah, the comic book.

01:07:19.332 --> 01:07:20.566
When he's not The Flash.

01:07:20.567 --> 01:07:22.067
That's his name, Barry Allen.

01:07:22.068 --> 01:07:24.803
Thank you.

01:07:28.774 --> 01:07:31.443
Now get this,
He reads comic books.

01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:33.078
Comic books!
Barry Allen is The Flash!

01:07:33.079 --> 01:07:34.480
Carl, slow down. Slow down.

01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:36.582
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:38.750
He's a kid.
Our unsub is a kid.

01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:40.652
That's why we couldn't match
his prints.

01:07:40.653 --> 01:07:42.387
That's why he doesn't have
a record.

01:07:42.388 --> 01:07:43.888
Now, I want you to contact NYPD

01:07:43.889 --> 01:07:46.592
for every all-points juvenile
runaways in New York City.

01:07:46.593 --> 01:07:48.093
And don't forget the airports.

01:07:48.094 --> 01:07:50.129
He's been kiting checks
all over the country.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.497
But why New York?

01:07:51.498 --> 01:07:52.498
The Yankees!

01:07:52.499 --> 01:07:55.167
He said something
about the Yankees!

01:07:55.168 --> 01:07:57.902
So where are we on the list?

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:02.541
Number 53, "Abagnahlee."

01:08:04.744 --> 01:08:05.944
Good morning, ma'am.

01:08:05.945 --> 01:08:07.246
We're the FBI agents
who called.

01:08:07.247 --> 01:08:08.780
Yes, I've been waiting.

01:08:08.781 --> 01:08:10.682
I hope you're all hungry.

01:08:10.683 --> 01:08:12.484
I put out the Sara Lee.

01:08:15.288 --> 01:08:17.622
My husband Jack is a lawyer.

01:08:17.624 --> 01:08:20.658
What about your first husband,
Mrs. "Abagnahlee"?

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.261
Abagnale

01:08:22.261 --> 01:08:24.563
but I prefer
to be called Barnes.

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:27.799
"Frank William Abagnale."

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.535
It says here
he was in the service.

01:08:29.536 --> 01:08:31.502
Did... Did you two meet
during the war?

01:08:31.504 --> 01:08:34.305
Yeah, I lived
in a very small village

01:08:34.307 --> 01:08:37.609
in France... Montrichard...
the kind of place

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:40.312
where they never heard
of Sara Lee.

01:08:40.313 --> 01:08:41.979
Help yourselves.

01:08:41.981 --> 01:08:44.049
"Nobody doesn't
like Sara Lee."

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:46.285
You filled out
a missing person's report

01:08:46.286 --> 01:08:49.555
for a runaway juvenile by
the name of Frank Abagnale Jr.

01:08:49.555 --> 01:08:51.156
Is Frankie okay?

01:08:51.157 --> 01:08:53.358
You're aware of the fact
that he wrote some checks

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.327
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

01:08:55.328 --> 01:08:56.828
Oh, yes.

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:59.430
The police think
he's some type of criminal.

01:08:59.432 --> 01:09:02.133
What he did was a felony,
Mrs. Barnes.

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:03.935
It was $1,000.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:07.171
Half the kids his age
are on dope

01:09:07.173 --> 01:09:09.741
throwing rocks at police

01:09:09.742 --> 01:09:11.343
and they scared me to death

01:09:11.344 --> 01:09:13.612
because my son made
a little mistake.

01:09:13.613 --> 01:09:15.479
Huh. A 17-year-...

01:09:15.481 --> 01:09:19.783

has to have a place to sleep.

Is he in trouble?

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:49.413
Ma'am, I'm sorry
to have to tell you,

01:09:49.415 --> 01:09:50.582
Your son is forging checks.

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.350
Forging checks? Wait!

01:09:52.352 --> 01:09:53.818
I'm sure we can
take care of that.

at the church now.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.848
if I asked you
to check on the status

01:12:02.849 --> 01:12:04.416
of my friend Lance Applebaum

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:06.951
that you could do that for me
in a second.

01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:09.988
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

01:12:09.989 --> 01:12:11.823
Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery.

01:12:12.324 --> 01:12:15.059
Um...

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.062
Mr. Applebaum
fractured his ankle.

01:12:18.063 --> 01:12:21.500
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:25.369
You see that? No problem.

01:12:26.773 --> 01:12:29.408
This is the emergency chart.

01:12:29.409 --> 01:12:30.942
See that blue star there?

01:12:30.943 --> 01:12:33.779
That means that the patient
has been diagnosed.

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.647
And then,
after he's been treated

01:12:35.648 --> 01:12:39.217
we put a red circle here, see?

01:12:39.218 --> 01:12:41.086
How do you like those braces?

01:12:42.822 --> 01:12:45.023
I guess they're all right.

01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:48.226
I got mine off last year.

01:12:48.227 --> 01:12:50.295
Boy, I hated them.
They were bottoms.

01:12:50.296 --> 01:12:51.996
You know, I still got to wear

01:12:51.997 --> 01:12:54.265
my mouth guard.

01:12:54.266 --> 01:12:56.668
You have really nice teeth.

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.704
Well, thank you.

01:12:59.705 --> 01:13:03.041
And you have a pretty smile.

01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:04.943
Custodial to cafeteria.

01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:07.378
No, I mean it.

01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:09.448
I really think those
braces look good on you.

01:13:09.449 --> 01:13:11.450
Thank you.

01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:13.985
You're welcome.

01:13:16.388 --> 01:13:17.823
Brenda.

01:13:17.824 --> 01:13:19.123
Yeah.

01:13:19.124 --> 01:13:22.326
Do you know if they're
hiring here at the hospital?

01:13:23.463 --> 01:13:25.196
I'm not sure.

01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:26.832
What do you want to do?

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:30.902
I'm a doctor.

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:34.939
<i>Dear Dad,</i>

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.309
<i>I've decided to get</i>
<i>off the road for awhile.</i>

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.678
<i>I've taken a night job</i>
<i>at a hospital</i>

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.446
<i>and met</i>
<i>some really nice people.</i>

01:13:41.447 --> 01:13:43.649
<i>Feels good to have my feet</i>
<i>on the ground</i>

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:47.319
<i>to wake up in the same bed</i>
<i>every night.</i>

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.556
<i>Who knows, maybe I'll even find</i>
<i>someone to settle down with.</i>

01:13:53.993 --> 01:13:56.060
Harvard Medical School...

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:58.430
top of your class.

01:13:58.431 --> 01:14:01.566
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:05.270
Well, that's a pretty impressive
resume, Dr. Conners

01:14:05.271 --> 01:14:08.540
but unfortunately, uh...
the only thing I need

01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:11.976
is a... an emergency room
supervisor

01:14:11.977 --> 01:14:14.946
for my midnight
to 8:00am shift

01:14:14.947 --> 01:14:19.418
someone to baby-sit
six interns and 20 nurses

01:14:19.419 --> 01:14:22.321
but, uh...

01:14:22.322 --> 01:14:26.358
Hell, I doubt that, uh,
you would be interested in that.

01:14:26.359 --> 01:14:28.259
Well, in the past

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:32.964
they've always let me
choose my own nurses.

01:14:32.965 --> 01:14:35.734
Dr. Connelly?

01:14:35.735 --> 01:14:36.968
Dr. Harris?

01:14:36.969 --> 01:14:38.169
Present.

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:39.904
Dr. Ashland?

01:14:39.905 --> 01:14:41.573
Dr. Conners...

01:14:41.574 --> 01:14:43.908
You gonna take roll every night?

01:14:43.909 --> 01:14:45.811
Uh, yes, I will,
Dr. Ashland

01:14:45.812 --> 01:14:47.912
and if you're going to be late

01:14:47.913 --> 01:14:49.781
I suggest you bring a note.

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:55.220
Miss Basmann.

01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:56.988
Miss Mace.

01:14:56.989 --> 01:14:58.657
Miss Strong.

01:14:58.658 --> 01:15:00.091
Here.

01:15:00.092 --> 01:15:02.260
Nurse Brown.

01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:04.363
- Nurse Sanford?
- Here.

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:06.798
30 milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

01:15:06.799 --> 01:15:08.299
Run the plasma
at 60 drops a minute

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.836
until we calculate
the fluid requirements.

01:15:10.837 --> 01:15:13.037
What do you estimate
the degree and extent

01:15:13.038 --> 01:15:14.172
of the burns, Kildare?

01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:15.874
Second and third-degree burns

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:17.576
over about 20 percent
of the body surface.

01:15:17.577 --> 01:15:18.577
Do you concur?

01:15:18.578 --> 01:15:19.578
I concur.

01:15:19.579 --> 01:15:21.613
Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

01:15:21.614 --> 01:15:25.149
Nurse Hopp
to the Nurses' Station South.

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.952
Nurse Hopp to
the Nurses' Station South.

01:15:27.953 --> 01:15:29.421
Hello, Brenda.

01:15:29.422 --> 01:15:30.756
Hi, Dr. Conners.

01:15:30.757 --> 01:15:32.791
You need to sign these.

01:15:32.792 --> 01:15:34.993
Thank you.

01:15:40.566 --> 01:15:42.901
Do you notice anything
different about me, Doctor?

01:15:42.902 --> 01:15:44.436
- You got your braces off!
- Yeah!

01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:45.804
Come here.
Let me see.

01:15:45.805 --> 01:15:47.806
I've been trying
to show you all night!

01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:51.042
Wow. Good job.

01:15:51.043 --> 01:15:52.611
Yeah?

01:15:52.612 --> 01:15:54.379
So, did it hurt when
they took them off?

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.547
Mine felt so weird after.

01:15:55.548 --> 01:15:57.682
Mm, I keep rubbing
my tongue over them.

01:15:57.683 --> 01:15:59.551
I can't stop.
They're so slippery.

01:15:59.552 --> 01:16:01.052
It feels good, though,
doesn't it?

01:16:01.053 --> 01:16:03.254
Yeah, it feels incredible.

01:16:12.732 --> 01:16:14.265
Oh, my.

01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:16.768
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.449
Dr. Conners to the ER.

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.150
Dr. Conners to the ER.

01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:33.351
Shouldn't you go?

01:16:33.352 --> 01:16:35.186
No. No, no.

01:16:35.187 --> 01:16:37.221
They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward.

01:16:37.222 --> 01:16:39.423
We'll be fine.

01:16:43.663 --> 01:16:46.932
What if he's in surgery?

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:50.101
Do you really think
I have to go?

01:16:50.102 --> 01:16:52.771
Oh. In here,
Dr. Conners.

01:17:09.054 --> 01:17:13.124
Gentlemen, what, uh...
what seems to be the problem?

01:17:13.125 --> 01:17:14.493
Bicycle accident.

01:17:14.494 --> 01:17:18.597
Fractured tibia about
five inches below the patella.

01:17:18.598 --> 01:17:20.799
Hmm.

01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:25.236
- Dr. Harris.
- Yes?

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:26.337
Do you concur?

01:17:26.338 --> 01:17:29.774
C... Concur
with what, sir?

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.776
With what Dr. Ashland
just said.

01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:34.445
Do you... Do you concur?

01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:36.781
Uh... well, it was
a bicycle accident.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:38.750
Um, the boy told us.

01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:40.351
So you concur?

01:17:40.352 --> 01:17:41.887
Concur? Uh...

01:17:41.888 --> 01:17:43.655
I think we should take an X ray

01:17:43.656 --> 01:17:46.491
then stitch him up and put him
in a walking cast.

01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:52.030
That's very good, Dr. Ashland.
Very good.

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:54.799
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.667
Carry on.

01:17:58.337 --> 01:18:01.139
I blew it, didn't I?

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.341
Why didn't I concur?

01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:06.411
Dr. Henning, call extension 219.

01:18:06.412 --> 01:18:08.013
Dr. Henning, extension 219.

01:18:25.064 --> 01:18:26.397
Make yourself at home!

01:18:26.398 --> 01:18:29.400
Frank Abagnale Sr.

01:18:29.401 --> 01:18:31.870
You're not a cop.

01:18:31.871 --> 01:18:35.707
Special Agent Hanratty, FBI.

01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:36.741
You're not a cop.

01:18:36.742 --> 01:18:39.243
My landlord said
you were not a cop.

01:18:39.244 --> 01:18:40.879
Well, if you're
going to arrest me

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.547
I'd like to put on
a different suit

01:18:42.548 --> 01:18:43.748
if that's okay with you.

01:18:43.749 --> 01:18:45.416
No, no, I'm not here
to arrest you.

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:47.485
I'm looking for your son.
He's in trouble.

01:18:47.486 --> 01:18:49.120
Do you know where he is?

01:18:51.724 --> 01:18:52.958
If I tell you where he is

01:18:52.959 --> 01:18:54.960
will you promise
not to tell his mother?

01:18:54.961 --> 01:18:56.728
Sure.

01:18:56.729 --> 01:19:00.231
Frank made up a fake I.D.

01:19:00.232 --> 01:19:01.700
and enlisted
in the Marine Corps.

01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:03.167
He's over in Vietnam right now.

01:19:03.168 --> 01:19:04.970
That kid is halfway
around the world

01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:07.572
crawling through
the damn jungle

01:19:07.573 --> 01:19:10.041
fighting the Communists, so...

01:19:12.244 --> 01:19:15.847
please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal

01:19:15.848 --> 01:19:17.248
because that kid
has more guts...

01:19:17.249 --> 01:19:19.183
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale.

01:19:19.184 --> 01:19:20.952
I said he was in trouble.

01:19:20.953 --> 01:19:24.522
If you'd like to give me a call
and talk, here's my number.

01:19:36.736 --> 01:19:38.736
You're not a father, are you?

01:19:40.706 --> 01:19:43.108
Pardon me?

01:19:43.109 --> 01:19:44.575
If you were a father,
you'd know.

01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:48.046
I would never give up my son.

01:19:48.047 --> 01:19:51.750
I would never give up my son.

01:19:51.751 --> 01:19:55.186
Yes, sir.
I understand.

01:19:55.187 --> 01:19:57.421
Sean, Sean, now get this,

01:19:57.422 --> 01:19:58.857
"Riverbend Apartments,"

01:19:58.858 --> 01:20:00.625
"415 Landover",

01:20:00.626 --> 01:20:02.393
"Atlanta, Georgia."

01:20:02.394 --> 01:20:03.828
Atlanta, Georgia.

01:20:03.829 --> 01:20:05.530
Yeah, I'm on my way
to the airport.

01:20:05.531 --> 01:20:07.598
I'll meet the team in, uh,
in four hours.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:09.334
Bye-bye.

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:12.937
Come on, it's okay.

01:20:14.473 --> 01:20:16.407
You don't have to cry.

01:20:16.408 --> 01:20:17.676
I'm sorry.

01:20:17.677 --> 01:20:19.544
I'm so sorry, Frank.

01:20:19.545 --> 01:20:21.046
I can't do this.

01:20:21.047 --> 01:20:23.581
Brenda, listen to me.

01:20:23.582 --> 01:20:25.950
I don't care if you're
a virgin, all right?

01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:27.152
Really, I can wait.

01:20:27.153 --> 01:20:30.488
I'm not a virgin.

01:20:34.226 --> 01:20:37.061
I had an abortion
two years ago.

01:20:39.264 --> 01:20:43.668
My parents had a friend do it

01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:47.972
a man that my father
plays golf with.

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:49.908
And then, when I got better

01:20:49.909 --> 01:20:52.276
they kicked me
out of the house.

01:20:52.277 --> 01:20:55.180
I had an abortion and I wasn't
their daughter anymore.

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:56.681
Hey...

01:20:56.682 --> 01:20:57.682
I'm so sorry.

01:20:57.683 --> 01:20:59.283
Please don't be mad at me.

01:20:59.284 --> 01:21:01.452
Please, please
don't be mad at me.

01:21:01.453 --> 01:21:02.587
No, no.

01:21:02.588 --> 01:21:04.422
Please don't be mad at me.

01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:06.290
Shh. Now... what if...

01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:09.594
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

01:21:09.595 --> 01:21:11.562
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

01:21:11.563 --> 01:21:13.564
Well, I ask them all the time

01:21:13.565 --> 01:21:16.267
but they said I still
can't come home.

01:21:16.268 --> 01:21:20.504
And my daddy's...
a lawyer.

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.706
Aw...

01:21:27.746 --> 01:21:31.248
Brenda...

01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:34.719
what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.721
Will that change anything?

01:21:36.722 --> 01:21:38.555
What?

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:45.663
What if I went
to your parents...

01:21:45.664 --> 01:21:47.999
and I spoke to your father...

01:21:51.269 --> 01:21:54.705
and I asked permission
to marry you?

01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:08.886
It's empty.

01:22:08.887 --> 01:22:10.554
Nobody here.

01:22:35.413 --> 01:22:37.815
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

01:22:37.816 --> 01:22:39.984
Yes, I-I am a Lutheran

01:22:39.985 --> 01:22:43.187
but, please, call me Frank.

01:22:43.188 --> 01:22:46.023
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:54.431
Unless you're not comfortable.

01:22:54.432 --> 01:22:56.633
Absolutely.

01:23:06.045 --> 01:23:09.780
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

01:23:11.516 --> 01:23:13.517
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

01:23:13.518 --> 01:23:15.787
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

01:23:15.788 --> 01:23:18.422
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

01:23:18.423 --> 01:23:20.424
and he walked out.

01:23:20.425 --> 01:23:23.427
Amen.

01:23:23.428 --> 01:23:24.628
Amen.

01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:27.631
Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

01:23:27.632 --> 01:23:30.301
The mouse, he churned
that cream into butter.

01:23:32.938 --> 01:23:33.938
That's right.

01:23:33.939 --> 01:23:35.306
That's pretty good.

01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:37.041
Thank you.

01:23:37.042 --> 01:23:38.810
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

01:23:38.811 --> 01:23:40.678
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:42.880
Well, um, to be quite honest

01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:46.150
I'm thinking about
getting back into law.

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:47.952
Oh, my!

01:23:47.953 --> 01:23:50.188
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:52.289
Before I went to medical school

01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:54.425
I passed the bar in California.

01:23:54.426 --> 01:23:56.427
I practiced law for one year

01:23:56.428 --> 01:23:59.864
then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

01:23:59.865 --> 01:24:02.700
You're just full of surprises.

01:24:02.701 --> 01:24:03.701
Yeah.

01:24:03.702 --> 01:24:06.137
Oh, my.

01:24:06.138 --> 01:24:07.171
A doctor and a lawyer.

01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:09.173
Well, I'd say that Brenda
hit the jackpot.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:12.176
Where did you go to law school?

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:13.911
Uh, Berkeley.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.280
Berkley, Berkley.
Oh, my gosh.

01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:17.882
Isn't that where
you went, Daddy?

01:24:17.883 --> 01:24:19.851
Maybe Frank could
come work for you, Roger.

01:24:19.852 --> 01:24:21.619
You're always saying
how hard it is

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.187
to find Assistant Prosecutors.

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:25.422
Could he, Daddy?
Could he, please?

01:24:25.423 --> 01:24:26.924
Could he come
work with you, please?

01:24:26.925 --> 01:24:29.026
Was that snake Hollingsworth
still teaching there

01:24:29.027 --> 01:24:30.294
when you went through Berkley?

01:24:31.997 --> 01:24:33.530
Hollingsworth.

01:24:33.531 --> 01:24:36.667
Yes. Grumpy old
Hollingsworth, right?

01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:38.269
I tell you.
Meaner than ever.

01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:40.471
And that dog of his?

01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:47.278
Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

01:24:55.587 --> 01:24:59.090
I'm sorry. Uh...

01:24:59.091 --> 01:25:01.092
The dog was dead.

01:25:02.627 --> 01:25:06.197
How unfortunate.

01:25:06.198 --> 01:25:08.399
Yeah.

01:25:38.496 --> 01:25:41.499
A doctor, a lawyer,
a Lutheran...

01:25:44.002 --> 01:25:47.038
So what are you, Frank?

01:25:47.039 --> 01:25:48.840
'Cause I think
you're about to ask

01:25:48.841 --> 01:25:50.674
for my daughter's hand
in marriage

01:25:50.675 --> 01:25:52.210
and I have a right to know.

01:25:52.211 --> 01:25:54.545
Know what, sir?

01:25:54.546 --> 01:25:57.315
The truth.

01:25:57.316 --> 01:26:01.752
Tell me the truth, Frank.

01:26:01.753 --> 01:26:05.556
What are you doing here?

01:26:05.557 --> 01:26:08.759
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.895
If you want my blessing

01:26:10.896 --> 01:26:13.064
if you want my daughter

01:26:13.065 --> 01:26:16.233
I'd like to hear
it from you now.

01:26:18.904 --> 01:26:21.105
The truth is, sir, that...

01:26:24.542 --> 01:26:26.277
The truth is that...

01:26:28.347 --> 01:26:32.015
I'm not a doctor,
I'm not a lawyer...

01:26:34.119 --> 01:26:36.888
I'm not an airline pilot.

01:26:36.889 --> 01:26:40.091
I'm... I'm nothing, really.

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:49.800
I'm-I'm-I'm just a kid who's
in love with your daughter.

01:26:52.837 --> 01:26:55.372
No.

01:27:03.048 --> 01:27:05.449
You know what you are?

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:07.451
You're a romantic.

01:27:07.452 --> 01:27:10.487
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

01:27:10.488 --> 01:27:13.657
I must confess, I'm guilty
of the same foolish whimsy.

01:27:13.658 --> 01:27:15.859
I proposed to Carol
after five dates

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.397
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

01:27:19.398 --> 01:27:21.532
because I knew she was the one.

01:27:21.533 --> 01:27:24.568
So go ahead, Frank.

01:27:27.406 --> 01:27:29.473
Don't be afraid.

01:27:29.474 --> 01:27:33.377
Ask the question
you came here to ask me.

01:27:35.147 --> 01:27:37.681
Sir, uh, uh...

01:27:37.682 --> 01:27:39.250
w-what would I have to do

01:27:39.251 --> 01:27:41.885
to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

01:27:46.524 --> 01:27:50.294
No, the... the other question.

01:27:53.531 --> 01:27:57.501
Right through that door.

01:27:57.502 --> 01:28:00.371
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

01:28:00.372 --> 01:28:02.373
Thank you.

01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:11.182
Hey, Frank...

01:28:11.183 --> 01:28:13.417
you know what I could
never figure out?

01:28:13.418 --> 01:28:16.187
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

01:28:16.188 --> 01:28:18.022
Why? What's the difference?

01:28:18.023 --> 01:28:20.391
Someone else took the test
for you, didn't they?

01:28:20.392 --> 01:28:23.160
Carl, I'm going to prison
for a long time.

01:28:23.161 --> 01:28:25.963
Seriously,
what's the difference?

01:28:25.964 --> 01:28:28.265
It's a simple question.

01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:30.901
Are you going to eat
that eclair?

01:28:33.238 --> 01:28:36.940
Yeah. I'm saving
it for later.

01:28:36.941 --> 01:28:38.775
Well, you want
to split it with me?

01:28:38.776 --> 01:28:42.346
No.

01:28:42.347 --> 01:28:46.016
Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:59.930
I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:09.840
You'll be working under
Phillip Rigby in corporate law.

01:29:09.841 --> 01:29:13.076
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

01:29:15.113 --> 01:29:16.647
Thank you.

01:29:16.648 --> 01:29:19.483
We're having lunch at 12:30
with the Attorney General

01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:21.485
and Governor McKeithen.

01:29:21.486 --> 01:29:22.819
Himself.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:24.155
The Governor.

01:29:24.156 --> 01:29:25.389
Did we spell it right?

01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:27.024
You sure did.

01:29:27.025 --> 01:29:28.860
Congratulations.

01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:30.094
Thank you, sir.

01:29:30.095 --> 01:29:31.396
Welcome aboard.

01:29:31.397 --> 01:29:33.598
Now...

01:29:37.803 --> 01:29:39.970
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

01:29:39.971 --> 01:29:43.173
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

01:29:43.174 --> 01:29:45.276
where they found him, dead.

01:29:45.277 --> 01:29:49.079
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.649
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:53.150
on a canceled check.

01:29:53.151 --> 01:29:55.720
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

01:29:55.721 --> 01:29:56.921
which matches

01:29:56.922 --> 01:29:59.957
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:01.759
which discuss the possibility

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.094
of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

01:30:04.095 --> 01:30:05.296
Your Honor

01:30:05.297 --> 01:30:07.398
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

01:30:07.399 --> 01:30:09.099
this is irrefutable evidence

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.437
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

01:30:17.108 --> 01:30:22.914
Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

01:30:22.915 --> 01:30:26.517
There is no... defendant.

01:30:26.518 --> 01:30:31.155
There is no... jury.

01:30:31.156 --> 01:30:34.158
It's just me.

01:30:34.159 --> 01:30:35.793
Son...

01:30:35.794 --> 01:30:40.197
what in the hell
is wrong with you?!

01:30:40.198 --> 01:30:42.132
Is that Mitch?

01:30:42.133 --> 01:30:43.935
Roger! It's Mitch!

01:30:43.936 --> 01:30:45.570
Oh, my, I lost
all track of time.

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:48.506
As studio
guests for the sing-along tonight

01:30:48.507 --> 01:30:50.808
we have the children's choir
of St. Monica's Church

01:30:50.809 --> 01:30:52.643
in New York City.

01:30:52.644 --> 01:30:54.445
Won't you join them and the gang

01:30:54.446 --> 01:30:56.714
in a few songs for the Irish?

01:32:42.487 --> 01:32:44.722

I took a job.
A government job.

01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:48.092
You see what I'm doing?

01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:49.860
Do you have a good lawyer?

01:32:49.861 --> 01:32:52.362
Well... I sort of am
a lawyer now.

01:32:52.363 --> 01:32:56.200
Look at this letter.
The IRS wants more.

01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:58.703
I had a deal with them,
two penalties.

01:32:58.704 --> 01:33:02.139
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:05.009
I want to sue them.

01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:07.979
Now they want the crumbs.

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.114
They... Here, sit down.

01:33:10.115 --> 01:33:12.750
They're trying to scare
me, intimidate me.

01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:15.352
You know what?

01:33:15.353 --> 01:33:18.856
You know what? I'll
make them chase me...

01:33:18.857 --> 01:33:21.425
for the rest of their lives.

01:33:27.265 --> 01:33:31.002
Hey, it's great
to see you, Daddy.

01:33:31.003 --> 01:33:35.605
Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

01:33:37.175 --> 01:33:39.543
I came here to give you this.

01:33:39.544 --> 01:33:43.981
It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:47.752
Daddy, I'm getting married.

01:33:47.753 --> 01:33:50.721
Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

01:33:50.722 --> 01:33:53.323
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

01:33:53.324 --> 01:33:55.559
Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.394
I'm getting a $60,000 house.

01:33:57.395 --> 01:33:59.396
I'm-I'm getting it all back.

01:33:59.397 --> 01:34:01.899
All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:04.669
Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

01:34:04.670 --> 01:34:06.570
Now...

01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:10.340
has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

01:34:10.341 --> 01:34:13.844
Yeah, she came to
pick up some boxes.

01:34:13.845 --> 01:34:15.546
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

01:34:15.547 --> 01:34:17.682
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

01:34:17.683 --> 01:34:19.550
I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

01:34:19.551 --> 01:34:20.985
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

01:34:20.986 --> 01:34:22.219
One of those Manhattan Eagle

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.587
three-button
black pearl suits.

01:34:23.588 --> 01:34:24.655
You'll look great.

01:34:24.656 --> 01:34:26.123
Those are nice. Yeah.

01:34:26.124 --> 01:34:28.926
She won't see me.

01:34:29.761 --> 01:34:31.662
Well, have you tried
to call her?

01:34:31.663 --> 01:34:33.831
Uh-uh.

01:34:33.832 --> 01:34:36.400
Why don't... why don't you
call her right now?

01:34:36.401 --> 01:34:38.903
Dad, why don't you
call her right now? Here.

01:34:38.904 --> 01:34:41.138
Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

01:34:41.139 --> 01:34:42.873
You call her, and you tell her

01:34:42.874 --> 01:34:45.642
I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

01:34:45.643 --> 01:34:48.278
Your mother's married now,
to my friend Jack Barnes.

01:34:48.279 --> 01:34:51.682
They have a house
in Long Island.

01:34:51.683 --> 01:34:55.452
I had an
FBI agent come see me.

01:34:55.453 --> 01:34:57.321
You got their number, son.

01:34:57.322 --> 01:34:59.456
The guy looked scared.

01:34:59.457 --> 01:35:03.961
The United States government,
champ, running for the hills.

01:35:03.962 --> 01:35:06.463
Pow! To the moon!

01:35:17.442 --> 01:35:20.544
Dad... it's over.

01:35:21.813 --> 01:35:23.814
I'm going to stop now.

01:35:23.815 --> 01:35:25.916
But y-you've...

01:35:25.917 --> 01:35:28.119
They're never going
to catch you, Frank.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.354
- Why won't you sit down?
- Dad, she wouldn't do that.

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:32.322
- Come on, sit.
- Why would she do that to you?

01:35:32.323 --> 01:35:33.991
Come on, sit with me.
Have a drink.

01:35:33.992 --> 01:35:35.359
I'm your father.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.829
Then ask me to stop.

01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:41.265
Then ask me to stop.

01:35:43.935 --> 01:35:46.136
You can't stop.

01:35:48.073 --> 01:35:49.907
Where are you going?

01:35:49.908 --> 01:35:52.342
Come on, Frank,
where are you going?

01:35:52.343 --> 01:35:53.778
Where are you going?

01:35:53.779 --> 01:35:55.780
Where are you going tonight?

01:35:55.781 --> 01:35:56.981
Someplace exotic?

01:35:56.982 --> 01:35:58.348
Where are you going tonight?

01:35:58.349 --> 01:35:59.716
Tahiti, Hawaii?

01:36:17.335 --> 01:36:20.271
This is Hanratty.

01:36:20.272 --> 01:36:22.339
Hello, Carl.

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.341
Merry Christmas.

01:36:24.342 --> 01:36:26.743
How are you, Dr. Conners?

01:36:26.744 --> 01:36:31.248
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

01:36:33.084 --> 01:36:36.320
Well... I'm sitting here
in my office

01:36:36.321 --> 01:36:37.955
on Christmas Eve.

01:36:37.956 --> 01:36:39.589
What do you want?

01:36:43.929 --> 01:36:46.897
Okay.

01:36:51.002 --> 01:36:53.437
I want it to be over.

01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:58.809
Uh... I want it to be over.

01:36:58.810 --> 01:37:00.744
I'm getting married.

01:37:00.745 --> 01:37:02.779
You know, I'm settling down.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:04.781
You've stolen
almost $4 million.

01:37:04.782 --> 01:37:07.151
You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

01:37:07.152 --> 01:37:10.187
Nah, this isn't something you
get to walk away from, Frank.

01:37:10.188 --> 01:37:11.689
I want to call a truce.

01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:12.856
No truce.

01:37:12.857 --> 01:37:14.825
You will be caught,
you will go to prison.

01:37:14.826 --> 01:37:16.459
Where did you think
this was going?

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.863
Please leave me alone, Carl.

01:37:19.864 --> 01:37:21.264
Please?

01:37:21.265 --> 01:37:23.133
I'm getting close, aren't I?

01:37:23.134 --> 01:37:25.302
You're scared because
I'm getting close.

01:37:25.303 --> 01:37:28.538
I know you... you rented
that car in Shreveport

01:37:28.539 --> 01:37:31.541
and you stayed in that hotel
on Lake Charles.

01:37:31.542 --> 01:37:33.577
You want to run, be my guest.

01:37:33.578 --> 01:37:35.946
Your checks don't lie
as well as you do.

01:37:35.947 --> 01:37:39.149
Stop chasing me.

01:37:41.152 --> 01:37:43.854
I can't stop.

01:37:43.855 --> 01:37:46.423
It's my job.

01:37:46.424 --> 01:37:48.926
It's okay, Carl.

01:37:48.927 --> 01:37:52.562
I just thought I'd ask,
you know?

01:37:54.799 --> 01:37:58.902
Hey. Merry Christmas, huh?

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.641
I love my job.

01:38:04.642 --> 01:38:06.309
All right...

01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:07.811
let's get every newspaper we can

01:38:07.812 --> 01:38:10.380
every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:11.681
What are we looking for?

01:38:11.682 --> 01:38:14.051
Engagement announcements,
name of Conners.

01:38:14.052 --> 01:38:16.453
Conners?! Come on,
Carl, the kid would've

01:38:16.454 --> 01:38:17.988
changed his name by now.

01:38:17.989 --> 01:38:20.791
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

01:38:20.792 --> 01:38:22.692
She thinks he's Conners.

01:38:22.693 --> 01:38:24.928
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

- Oh, me too. Thank you.
- I'm going to, uh, the little boys' room.

01:38:51.756 --> 01:38:52.956
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:38:52.957 --> 01:38:54.691
Hurry back.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.240
Good evening.

01:39:10.241 --> 01:39:11.842
I'm Agent Hanratty
with the FBI.

01:39:11.843 --> 01:39:14.244
We'd like to have
a few quiet words

01:39:14.245 --> 01:39:15.578
with your host, if possible.

01:39:15.579 --> 01:39:17.780
I'll get him.

01:39:18.749 --> 01:39:20.184
Right over there, sir.

01:39:20.185 --> 01:39:22.786
- Hi, Roger. How are you?
- Hi, Vin.

01:39:22.787 --> 01:39:25.155
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

01:39:25.156 --> 01:39:26.723
Carl Hanratty, FBI.

01:39:26.724 --> 01:39:28.926
This is Agents
Amdursky and Fox.

01:39:28.927 --> 01:39:31.094
Sorry to crash your party, sir.

01:39:31.095 --> 01:39:32.996
Not at all.
What can I do for you?

01:39:32.997 --> 01:39:34.564
If it's not too much trouble

01:39:34.565 --> 01:39:36.466
I'd like to meet the groom.

01:39:36.467 --> 01:39:39.502
Is there a problem?

01:39:39.503 --> 01:39:41.271
Frank! Frank!

01:39:41.272 --> 01:39:42.405
Can you hold all these?

01:39:42.406 --> 01:39:44.007
Yeah. Come here.

01:39:44.008 --> 01:39:46.376
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

01:39:46.377 --> 01:39:48.645
They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

01:39:48.646 --> 01:39:50.280
What are you doing?
What's wrong?

01:39:50.281 --> 01:39:52.015
We have to leave.

01:39:52.016 --> 01:39:53.884
What?!

01:39:53.885 --> 01:39:55.886
Brenda, you love me, right?

01:39:55.887 --> 01:39:57.387
Yes.

01:39:57.388 --> 01:39:59.022
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

01:39:59.023 --> 01:40:00.023
Yes.

01:40:00.024 --> 01:40:01.658
I mean, you'd love me
whether I was sick

01:40:01.659 --> 01:40:03.961
or whether I was poor or even
if I had a different name.

01:40:03.962 --> 01:40:05.528
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

01:40:05.529 --> 01:40:06.796
Brenda, listen.
A name, right?

01:40:06.797 --> 01:40:08.131
A name, it doesn't matter.

01:40:08.132 --> 01:40:09.733
My name is Frank
Conners, right?

01:40:09.734 --> 01:40:11.001
Yes.
That's who I am with you.

01:40:11.002 --> 01:40:12.302
But-but we all have secrets.

01:40:12.303 --> 01:40:13.770
You know, sometimes
when I travel

01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:16.073
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

01:40:16.074 --> 01:40:18.108
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:19.343
- Frank Black?!
- Frank Black.

01:40:19.344 --> 01:40:20.543
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

01:40:20.544 --> 01:40:23.247
Why are you saying all this?

01:40:23.248 --> 01:40:26.016
Brenda... Brenda, I don't
want to lie to you anymore.

01:40:26.017 --> 01:40:27.550
All right?
I'm not a doctor.

01:40:27.551 --> 01:40:29.319
I never went to medical school.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.055
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

01:40:32.056 --> 01:40:34.657
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

01:40:34.658 --> 01:40:36.526
when I was 16.

01:40:36.527 --> 01:40:39.329
Frank...

01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:41.631
Frank?

01:40:41.632 --> 01:40:43.633
You're not a Lutheran?

01:40:43.634 --> 01:40:46.136
Brenda... you see
all this money?

01:40:46.137 --> 01:40:48.171
You see all this money?
I have more.

01:40:48.172 --> 01:40:50.807
I have plenty more.

01:40:50.808 --> 01:40:51.841
I have enough money

01:40:51.842 --> 01:40:53.777
to last us for the
rest of our lives.

01:40:53.778 --> 01:40:55.245
Look.

01:40:55.246 --> 01:40:57.948
Frank, stop teasing me.

01:40:57.949 --> 01:40:59.249
You're Frank Conners.

01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:02.319
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.686
Brenda...

01:41:03.687 --> 01:41:05.755
Why would you lie to me?

01:41:05.756 --> 01:41:07.958
- Brenda, Brenda...
- I want to know your name.

01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:10.093
- Listen to me, Brenda.
- Tell me your name.

01:41:10.094 --> 01:41:11.461
We can live anywhere we want

01:41:11.462 --> 01:41:13.096
but you have to
trust me, Brenda.

01:41:13.097 --> 01:41:14.464
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

01:41:14.465 --> 01:41:16.533
- Do you... do you love me, Brenda?
- Yes.

01:41:16.534 --> 01:41:17.968
- You love me?
- I love you.

01:41:17.969 --> 01:41:20.537
Excuse me, Mother.

01:41:20.538 --> 01:41:22.940
Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty.
My wife Carol.

01:41:22.941 --> 01:41:24.541
- Oh, Mister...?
- Hanratty, ma'am.

01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:25.742
- Ratty.
- Yes.

01:41:25.743 --> 01:41:27.544
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

01:41:27.545 --> 01:41:29.846
I-I think they
went upstairs.

01:41:35.153 --> 01:41:37.020
Frank...

01:41:38.522 --> 01:41:40.490
Brenda, come here.

01:41:40.491 --> 01:41:42.559
Okay, in two days,
you're going to meet me

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.694
at Miami International
Airport, all right?

01:41:44.695 --> 01:41:47.297
You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

01:41:47.298 --> 01:41:48.531
You're going to take a taxicab.

01:41:48.532 --> 01:41:50.300
You give the taxi driver
this money right here

01:41:50.301 --> 01:41:52.169
and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.071
Brenda, you're going
to leave at 10:00am.

01:41:54.072 --> 01:41:55.905
- 10:00am, all right?
- But...

In the corner.

01:42:17.895 --> 01:42:19.229

10:00am, no matter what.

01:42:29.107 --> 01:42:30.107
In two days.
Two days.

01:42:30.108 --> 01:42:31.108
Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:32.542
In two days, I'll be there

01:42:32.543 --> 01:42:34.477
no matter what,
at 10:00am.

01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:42.685
You're not going
to tell anyone, Brenda.

01:42:42.686 --> 01:42:43.853
You have to promise me, now.

01:42:43.854 --> 01:42:45.222
Frank, please!

01:42:45.223 --> 01:42:47.590
Before you go, please
tell me your name.

01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:49.959
Please, tell me.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.797
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

01:43:41.612 --> 01:43:43.746
National Airlines

01:43:43.747 --> 01:43:46.483
flight number 27, serving
Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa

01:43:46.484 --> 01:43:50.353
and New York Kennedy,
is now available at gate no 4...

01:43:52.156 --> 01:43:56.493
Skycap, Gate 14.
Skycap, Gate 14.

01:43:56.494 --> 01:43:57.961
Taxi!

01:44:08.306 --> 01:44:10.774
Your attention...

01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:09.098
Brenda.

01:45:21.043 --> 01:45:22.043
<i>This guy's a no-show.</i>

01:45:22.044 --> 01:45:23.709
<i>- He must've got wise to us.</i>
<i>- Maybe he was tipped.</i>

01:45:23.747 --> 01:45:25.315
If he's not here today,
he'll be tomorrow.

01:45:25.316 --> 01:45:27.150
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

01:45:27.151 --> 01:45:28.551
He doesn't have a passport.

01:45:28.552 --> 01:45:31.054
For the last six months, he's
gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

01:45:31.055 --> 01:45:32.489
I'm betting
he can get a passport.

01:45:32.490 --> 01:45:34.324
So we have all our men
waiting for him here

01:45:34.325 --> 01:45:35.325
in Miami International.

01:45:35.326 --> 01:45:37.093
He's used it before.
He knows the layout.

01:45:37.094 --> 01:45:39.029
I talked to Miami police;
they've offered us

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:40.730
50 uniformed cops
in two shifts of 25.

01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:42.899
With our guys, that's almost
100 men in one airport.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.734
Don't you think we
should spread it around?

01:45:44.735 --> 01:45:46.302
No, no, this is the exit point.

01:45:46.303 --> 01:45:48.604
Well, how do you know
he hasn't rented a car

01:45:48.605 --> 01:45:50.907
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

01:45:50.908 --> 01:45:52.409
Because I'm not in New York.

01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:53.709
I'm not in Atlanta.

01:45:53.710 --> 01:45:55.545
Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts

01:45:55.546 --> 01:45:57.713
and I'm letting
all the universities

01:45:57.714 --> 01:46:00.550
in the area know
that Pan Am will be initiating

01:46:00.551 --> 01:46:02.685
a new recruiting program
this year.

01:46:02.686 --> 01:46:05.955
I'll, uh, be stopping
by your campus tomorrow morning.

01:46:05.956 --> 01:46:09.092
Thank you all very much
for coming.

01:46:09.093 --> 01:46:10.293
At the end of the day

01:46:10.294 --> 01:46:13.430
I'll be choosing eight
young ladies to be a part of...

01:46:15.099 --> 01:46:17.900
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:20.537
Now, these eight young ladies
will accompany me

01:46:20.538 --> 01:46:23.606
on a two-month public relations
tour through Europe.

01:46:24.942 --> 01:46:27.643
They will discover firsthand
what it takes

01:46:27.644 --> 01:46:29.779
to be a Pan American stewardess.

01:46:31.648 --> 01:46:34.050
Give me at least two men...

01:46:34.051 --> 01:46:36.953
Nah, one man
per every two counters.

01:46:36.954 --> 01:46:38.288
All right?

01:46:38.289 --> 01:46:39.789
Amdursky?

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:41.791
Yeah?

01:46:41.792 --> 01:46:43.960
Make sure your uniforms
are covering

01:46:43.961 --> 01:46:45.995
the sidewalk entrances
and exits.

01:46:45.996 --> 01:46:49.466
Hey... let's have, uh, periodic
sweeps of the men's lav.

01:46:49.467 --> 01:46:51.901
You, here.

01:46:51.902 --> 01:46:55.771
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

01:46:55.772 --> 01:46:58.374
Well, I think that
I'm really friendly

01:46:58.375 --> 01:47:00.143
and I can really help out

01:47:00.144 --> 01:47:03.813
and, um, make people
feel welcome on the plane and...

01:47:03.814 --> 01:47:06.382
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour

01:47:06.383 --> 01:47:08.084

Carl, your

01:48:51.689 --> 01:48:53.155
There's a guy
in a Pan Am uniform

01:48:53.156 --> 01:48:55.858
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
out in front of Terminal J.

01:48:55.859 --> 01:48:57.026
That's the charter terminal.

01:48:57.027 --> 01:48:58.328
Can you get a look at his face?

01:48:58.329 --> 01:48:59.529
He's got his pilot's cap on.

01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:00.763

01:49:17.414 --> 01:49:19.549

01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:21.884

01:49:21.885 --> 01:49:23.653
Don't shoot me!
I'm just a driver.

01:49:23.654 --> 01:49:25.755
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

01:49:25.756 --> 01:49:26.922
and pick someone up
at the airport.

01:49:26.923 --> 01:49:28.123
Who you picking up?

The kid's gone
completely out of control.

01:49:59.756 --> 01:50:00.923
Why wasn't I called?

01:50:00.924 --> 01:50:02.424
Nobody was called, sir.

01:50:02.425 --> 01:50:04.194
The banks didn't know what
was happening till last week.

01:50:04.195 --> 01:50:05.395
That's impossible.

01:50:05.396 --> 01:50:07.164
They didn't call
'cause it's not counterfeiting.

01:50:07.165 --> 01:50:08.798
- It's something else.
- Well, what is he doing?

01:50:08.799 --> 01:50:09.966
He's making real checks, sir.

01:50:09.967 --> 01:50:10.967
These are so perfect

01:50:10.968 --> 01:50:12.569
the airline didn't know
the difference.

01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:14.371
Last check was cashed
in Madrid a week ago.

01:50:14.372 --> 01:50:15.605
My guess is he's still there.

01:50:15.606 --> 01:50:16.973
We have to leave now, sir.
Today.

01:50:17.208 --> 01:50:18.208
Go where?

01:50:18.209 --> 01:50:19.676
Spain? You want
to go to Spain?

01:50:19.677 --> 01:50:20.911
Well, eventually,
he's got to go back

01:50:20.912 --> 01:50:22.179
to where the checks
were printed.

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.881
I think that's why
he's moving back through Europe.

01:50:23.882 --> 01:50:25.349
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:26.450
He's running out of checks.

01:50:26.451 --> 01:50:27.931
I know it's a...
it's a long shot, sir

01:50:28.419 --> 01:50:31.588
but if we track him from Madrid,
sir, we could still catch him.

01:50:31.689 --> 01:50:33.556
I'm sorry, Carl,
if you couldn't catch him here

01:50:33.557 --> 01:50:34.958
you're not going
to catch him there.

01:50:34.959 --> 01:50:36.860
But, sir, we're going
to let him get away.

01:50:36.861 --> 01:50:40.663
No, Carl, you let him get away.

01:51:21.271 --> 01:51:27.010
A perfect one-16th
all the way around.

01:51:27.011 --> 01:51:28.678
Hmm!

01:51:28.679 --> 01:51:31.647
Color separation is flawless.

01:51:33.684 --> 01:51:35.852
There's no bleeding. Hmm.

01:51:35.853 --> 01:51:38.521
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

01:51:38.522 --> 01:51:39.856
Nobody but us.

01:51:39.857 --> 01:51:41.691
Where was it printed?

01:51:41.692 --> 01:51:44.027
It was printed on a monster...

01:51:44.028 --> 01:51:45.028
A monster.

01:51:45.029 --> 01:51:46.529
A Heidelberg, an Istra...

01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:47.697
Heidelberg.

01:51:47.698 --> 01:51:49.365
A dinosaur, four colors.

01:51:49.366 --> 01:51:50.900
You can smell the weight.

01:51:50.901 --> 01:51:52.535
Two tons, without the ink.

01:51:54.038 --> 01:51:56.105
Where do they do printing
like this?

01:51:56.106 --> 01:51:57.740
Germany, Great Britain...

01:51:57.741 --> 01:51:58.741
France.

01:51:58.742 --> 01:52:01.544
France!

01:52:01.545 --> 01:52:03.746
France. Frank's mother said
the name of a village in France

01:52:03.747 --> 01:52:04.981
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

01:52:04.982 --> 01:52:06.549
The village where
she met Frank's father.

01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:08.051
Oh, yeah,
I don't remember, uh...

01:52:08.052 --> 01:52:10.019
It started with an M.
It was, uh, "Mont" something.

01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.020
"Mont." Mr. Fox?

01:52:11.021 --> 01:52:12.021
Uh, yes, yes.

01:52:12.022 --> 01:52:13.790
Question, "You met your husband
during the war?"

01:52:13.791 --> 01:52:15.725
Answer, "Yes, I lived
in a small village in France."

01:52:15.726 --> 01:52:17.060
Yeah, right.

01:52:17.061 --> 01:52:18.695
"The kind of place where
they never heard of Sara Lee."

01:52:18.696 --> 01:52:19.696
Tell me you wrote down

01:52:19.697 --> 01:52:21.064
the name of the
village, Mr. Fox.

You're under arrest.

Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

01:53:36.072 --> 01:53:37.540

French beans here.

01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:38.541

01:53:38.542 --> 01:53:40.510

01:53:40.511 --> 01:53:42.177
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

01:53:42.178 --> 01:53:43.312
They wanted to bring you in.

01:53:43.313 --> 01:53:44.547
You want a bite?

01:53:44.548 --> 01:53:46.081

You want a bite?

01:53:47.317 --> 01:53:49.018

I wouldn't bring them to you

And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

01:53:57.995 --> 01:53:59.428
There's, uh, there's uh...

01:53:59.429 --> 01:54:01.430
there's two dozen
French police officers out there

01:54:01.431 --> 01:54:02.464
right now on Christmas Eve?

01:54:02.465 --> 01:54:03.666
That's what you're telling me?

01:54:03.667 --> 01:54:05.001
Yeah.

01:54:05.002 --> 01:54:06.368
All right, all right.

01:54:06.369 --> 01:54:08.137
Well, there's no windows here.

01:54:08.138 --> 01:54:10.673
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

01:54:10.674 --> 01:54:11.841
No! No!

01:54:11.842 --> 01:54:13.509
I told them I'd walk out first

01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:14.610
and give a signal.

01:54:14.611 --> 01:54:16.078
Here, you can put
these on yourself.

01:54:16.079 --> 01:54:17.680
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

01:54:17.681 --> 01:54:18.848
You know why?

01:54:20.017 --> 01:54:21.517
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

01:54:21.518 --> 01:54:24.020
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

01:54:24.021 --> 01:54:25.922
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

01:54:25.923 --> 01:54:27.256
That's right.

01:54:27.257 --> 01:54:29.258
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

01:54:29.259 --> 01:54:31.027
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

01:54:31.028 --> 01:54:33.729
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

01:54:33.730 --> 01:54:35.898
Ah, that's good.
That's good.

01:54:35.899 --> 01:54:38.701
Tell me what
you want me to see, huh?

01:54:38.702 --> 01:54:39.769
I wouldn't lie to you.

01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:41.303
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

01:54:41.304 --> 01:54:42.872
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

01:54:42.873 --> 01:54:44.040
You lied to me about that!

01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:45.474
Didn't you lie about that?!

01:54:45.475 --> 01:54:47.209
You asked me if I had a family.

01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:48.744
I did, but I don't anymore.

01:54:57.554 --> 01:54:59.521
Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

01:54:59.522 --> 01:55:01.057
We're coming out right now.

01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:04.794
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

01:55:04.795 --> 01:55:06.796
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

01:55:06.797 --> 01:55:08.931
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

01:55:08.932 --> 01:55:09.932
It was Captain Luc.

01:55:09.933 --> 01:55:11.166
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

01:55:11.167 --> 01:55:12.568
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

01:55:12.569 --> 01:55:13.569
Ooh, Captain Luc.

01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:14.870
Well, Carl, I gotta say

01:55:14.871 --> 01:55:17.039
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.241
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

01:55:19.242 --> 01:55:20.576
me and you here,
it's me and you.

01:55:20.577 --> 01:55:22.078
So you're going to
have to catch me.

01:55:22.079 --> 01:55:23.079
Frank. Frank!

01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.981
You have to trust me on this!

01:55:24.982 --> 01:55:27.750
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

01:55:27.751 --> 01:55:28.918
They're angry.

01:55:28.919 --> 01:55:30.686
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

01:55:30.687 --> 01:55:31.787
you live in their country.

01:55:31.788 --> 01:55:33.656
I told you this was
what was going to happen

01:55:33.657 --> 01:55:35.457
that there was no other way
for it to end.

01:55:35.458 --> 01:55:38.260
Don't make a mistake!

01:55:38.261 --> 01:55:39.428
That's good.

01:55:39.429 --> 01:55:41.764
That's good, Carl, you know?

01:55:41.765 --> 01:55:42.765
Keep pushing that lie.

01:55:42.766 --> 01:55:43.766
Keep pushing it.

01:55:43.767 --> 01:55:45.434
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

01:55:45.435 --> 01:55:48.037
They're going to kill you!

01:55:48.038 --> 01:55:50.706
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

01:55:55.612 --> 01:55:58.047
Is that the truth?

01:56:01.451 --> 01:56:03.986
Yeah.

01:56:07.624 --> 01:56:10.292
You have any children, Carl?

01:56:10.293 --> 01:56:14.063
I have a four-year-old daughter.

01:56:14.064 --> 01:56:16.832
You swear on your daughter?

01:56:18.635 --> 01:56:21.337
You swear?

01:56:25.308 --> 01:56:28.644
You swear?

01:59:05.135 --> 01:59:07.136

02:05:25.397 --> 02:05:27.532
I mean, banks, they
always use hand-stamps

02:05:27.533 --> 02:05:29.067
for the dates, see.

02:05:29.068 --> 02:05:30.769
They get used
over and over again

02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:32.237
so they always get worn out

02:05:32.238 --> 02:05:34.139
and the numbers
are always cracking.

02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:35.874
The sixes and the nines...

02:05:35.875 --> 02:05:38.076
see, they go first.

02:05:39.879 --> 02:05:41.780
Thanks.

02:05:46.385 --> 02:05:49.587
<i>I'd like you to take a
look at something for me.</i>

02:05:54.226 --> 02:05:56.494
Tell me what you think.

02:05:59.032 --> 02:06:00.632
That's a fake.

02:06:00.633 --> 02:06:02.200
How do you know?

02:06:02.201 --> 02:06:03.401
You haven't looked at it.

02:06:03.402 --> 02:06:05.971
Well, there's
no perforated edge, right?

02:06:05.972 --> 02:06:09.007
I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.

02:06:09.008 --> 02:06:11.242
Yeah...

02:06:11.243 --> 02:06:12.544
Paper is double-bonded

02:06:12.545 --> 02:06:14.913
much too heavy
to be a bank check.

02:06:14.914 --> 02:06:18.917
Magnetic ink, it's, uh,
raised against my fingers

02:06:18.918 --> 02:06:20.251
instead of flat.

02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.954
And this doesn't
smell like MICR.

02:06:22.955 --> 02:06:24.022
It's some kind of a...

02:06:24.023 --> 02:06:25.791
you know, some kind
of a drafting ink.

02:06:25.792 --> 02:06:28.126
You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.

02:06:34.067 --> 02:06:35.934
Frank...

02:06:35.935 --> 02:06:37.869
would you be interested
in working

02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:40.005
with the FBI's
Financial Crimes Unit?

02:06:42.008 --> 02:06:43.041
I already got a job here.

02:06:43.042 --> 02:06:44.675
You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.

02:06:46.612 --> 02:06:51.382
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

02:06:51.383 --> 02:06:53.085
You'd be placed in
the custody of the FBI

02:06:53.086 --> 02:06:55.253
where you'd serve out the
remainder of your sentence

02:06:55.254 --> 02:06:57.188
as an employee of
the federal government.

02:06:59.625 --> 02:07:01.927
Under whose custody?

02:07:10.436 --> 02:07:13.138
Hi. I-I'm Frank Abagnale.

02:07:13.139 --> 02:07:15.640
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

02:07:15.641 --> 02:07:18.276
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

02:07:18.277 --> 02:07:20.511
Sir, Mr. Abagnale
is here.

02:07:20.512 --> 02:07:22.147
I'm going to call you back.

02:07:52.245 --> 02:07:54.246
Hello, Carl.

02:07:54.247 --> 02:07:55.881
Welcome to the FBI.

02:07:55.882 --> 02:07:58.149
I'll show you
where you're working.

02:08:05.324 --> 02:08:08.794
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

02:08:08.795 --> 02:08:11.529
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

02:08:11.530 --> 02:08:13.531
45 minutes for lunch.

02:08:13.532 --> 02:08:15.533
No, I...

02:08:15.534 --> 02:08:17.969
I mean, how long?

02:08:19.605 --> 02:08:21.773
Every day.

02:08:21.774 --> 02:08:24.175
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

02:09:15.828 --> 02:09:18.063
Yeah.

02:09:18.064 --> 02:09:21.066
- Hey, Carl.
- Hi.

02:09:21.067 --> 02:09:23.401
How you doing?

02:09:23.402 --> 02:09:24.836
It's not a good time, Frank.

02:09:24.837 --> 02:09:27.004
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

02:09:29.808 --> 02:09:32.744
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

02:09:32.745 --> 02:09:34.812
Tomorrow is Saturday.

02:09:34.813 --> 02:09:36.948
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

02:09:36.949 --> 02:09:38.549
I'll be back to work on Monday.

02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:39.717
You're going to see Grace, huh?

02:09:39.718 --> 02:09:41.486
Well, that's the plan.

02:09:44.991 --> 02:09:47.259
So what should
I do till Monday?

02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.027
I'm sorry, kid, I
can't help you there.

02:09:49.028 --> 02:09:50.295
Excuse me.

02:09:56.869 --> 02:09:59.304
This is Hanratty.

02:09:59.305 --> 02:10:01.506
Oh, yeah, put him on.

02:10:09.315 --> 02:10:11.316
Mr. Sawyer.

02:10:11.317 --> 02:10:13.218
How are you?

02:10:13.219 --> 02:10:15.253
I have a half a dozen
more checks

02:10:15.254 --> 02:10:17.522
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

02:10:50.473 --> 02:10:53.242
American Airlines 355

02:10:53.243 --> 02:10:55.643
serving Chicago
and San Francisco

02:10:55.644 --> 02:10:57.379
is now open
for passenger check-in.

02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:00.682
How'd you do it, Frank?

02:11:00.683 --> 02:11:04.019
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:06.454
What are you doing here?

02:11:06.455 --> 02:11:08.590
Listen...

02:11:08.591 --> 02:11:10.692
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

02:11:10.693 --> 02:11:13.661
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

02:11:13.662 --> 02:11:15.297
You try to run
here in the States

02:11:15.298 --> 02:11:17.499
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:20.869
I know that.

02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:23.405
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

02:11:23.406 --> 02:11:25.207
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

02:11:25.208 --> 02:11:27.509
and the Attorney General
of the United States

02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:28.510
you wouldn't run.

02:11:28.511 --> 02:11:31.446
Why'd you do it?

02:11:31.447 --> 02:11:32.881
You're just a kid.

02:11:32.882 --> 02:11:34.716
I'm not your kid.

02:11:34.717 --> 02:11:37.152
You said you were
going to Chicago.

02:11:37.153 --> 02:11:39.121
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

02:11:39.122 --> 02:11:41.123
She's going skiing.

02:11:41.124 --> 02:11:42.757
You said she was
four years old.

02:11:42.758 --> 02:11:43.926
You're lying.

02:11:43.927 --> 02:11:45.527
She was four when I left.

02:11:45.528 --> 02:11:46.962
Now she's 15.

02:11:46.963 --> 02:11:50.165
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

02:11:50.166 --> 02:11:52.467
I see Grace
every now and again.

02:11:52.468 --> 02:11:54.469
I don't understand.

02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:56.471
Sure you do.

02:11:56.472 --> 02:11:59.341
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

02:12:02.578 --> 02:12:05.580
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

02:12:05.581 --> 02:12:07.515
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

02:12:07.516 --> 02:12:09.884
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

02:12:09.885 --> 02:12:13.255
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

02:12:15.992 --> 02:12:18.260
Look.

02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:20.195
Frank...

02:12:20.196 --> 02:12:22.530
nobody's chasing you.

02:12:22.531 --> 02:12:26.969
American Airlines flight 131 to Pittsburgh

02:12:26.970 --> 02:12:28.971
is now ready for boarding.

02:12:28.972 --> 02:12:33.941
Passengers with boarding passes,
please proceed to Gate 23A.

02:12:40.916 --> 02:12:42.650
Okay.

02:12:42.651 --> 02:12:44.919
Alice, has he still not called?

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:47.121
No, he hasn't.

02:12:56.932 --> 02:12:59.601
<i>Good morning.</i>

02:12:59.602 --> 02:13:01.703
I've, uh, called this
meeting to discuss

02:13:01.704 --> 02:13:04.039
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.508
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

02:13:06.509 --> 02:13:08.510
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

02:13:12.648 --> 02:13:14.282
This unsub is a big dog

02:13:14.283 --> 02:13:16.451
passing checks
as large as five figures.

02:13:19.755 --> 02:13:22.757
Sorry I'm late.

02:13:22.758 --> 02:13:24.959
Sorry.

02:13:28.431 --> 02:13:31.900
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

02:13:31.901 --> 02:13:34.102
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

02:13:38.241 --> 02:13:42.210
There's impressions
on every line.

02:13:42.211 --> 02:13:46.180
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

02:13:49.652 --> 02:13:51.152
Mind if I take a look?

02:13:54.424 --> 02:13:57.626
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

02:13:59.262 --> 02:14:02.230
Cost the bank $16,000.

02:14:02.231 --> 02:14:04.232
It's a real check.

02:14:04.233 --> 02:14:06.268
Yeah.

02:14:06.269 --> 02:14:07.502
Yeah. It's been washed.

02:14:07.503 --> 02:14:09.504
The only thing original
is the signature.

02:14:09.505 --> 02:14:11.406
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

02:14:11.407 --> 02:14:13.741
I mean, this isn't
hydrochloride or bleach.

02:14:13.742 --> 02:14:16.078
No.

02:14:16.079 --> 02:14:17.812
Something new.

02:14:17.813 --> 02:14:19.948
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

02:14:19.949 --> 02:14:22.049
removes the ink that's
not been printed?

02:14:25.955 --> 02:14:28.957
How did you do it, Frank?

02:14:28.958 --> 02:14:32.160
How did you cheat on the
bar exam in Louisiana?

02:14:37.333 --> 02:14:40.569
I didn't cheat.

02:14:40.570 --> 02:14:44.439
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

02:14:45.308 --> 02:14:47.642
Is that the truth, Frank?

02:14:47.643 --> 02:14:49.911
Is that the truth?

02:14:49.912 --> 02:14:52.481
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

02:14:52.482 --> 02:14:55.249
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

02:14:56.852 --> 02:14:59.187
You're saying
that he's a local?

02:14:59.188 --> 02:15:00.455
Well, if it were me, you know

02:15:00.456 --> 02:15:02.824
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

02:15:02.825 --> 02:15:04.493
Make sure there's
enough money in there

02:15:04.494 --> 02:15:05.727
to make it worth your while.

02:15:05.728 --> 02:15:06.928
Exactly.

02:15:06.929 --> 02:15:08.997
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

02:15:10.399 --> 02:15:12.934
I guess all we have to
do now is catch him.

02:15:14.604 --> 02:15:17.038
We'll start first
thing in the morning.

02:15:17.039 --> 02:15:19.541
We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

02:15:19.542 --> 02:15:21.476
In Nevada, Arizona, California.

02:15:21.477 --> 02:15:23.745
Both names, right?
Chris Frank, too?

02:15:23.746 --> 02:15:25.747
Yeah...
