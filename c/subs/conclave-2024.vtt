WEBVTT

08:02.566 --> 08:03.942
Seal the room.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.915
Eminence Tedesco.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.793
Dean Lawrence!

13:55.627 --> 13:56.670
How are you?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.088
I'm well, Goffredo.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.968
- We've missed you.
- Yes.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.135
No doubt.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.224
Are you well?

14:12.394 --> 14:13.645
True.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.615
Yes, I believe so.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.575
Eminence Tedesco, may I?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.580
You're welcome.
See you later, Eminence.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.535
Bless all those

22:50.661 --> 22:54.040
who cannot share this meal
with us

22:54.415 --> 22:57.752
and help us, O Lord,
as we wat and drink,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.587
to remember the hungry,

23:00.713 --> 23:01.798
the thirsty,

23:02.965 --> 23:04.509
the sick,

23:04.634 --> 23:06.427
and the lonely,

23:06.552 --> 23:09.347
and the sisters who prepared
this food for us.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.641
Through Christ Our Lord.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.601
Amen.

23:30.785 --> 23:31.786
Dean!

23:41.129 --> 23:42.004
Come.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.136
Thank you.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.687
And we haven't even begun yet.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.818
Did I hear correctly,
Afghanistan?

24:03.943 --> 24:04.861
Yes.

24:04.986 --> 24:08.865
A marvellous testament to
the Universal Church,

24:10.408 --> 24:12.827
So many men of different
cultures, races,

24:12.952 --> 24:15.454
bound together
by their faith in God.

24:20.668 --> 24:21.586
Look around you.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.798
Notice how everyone gravitates
to their fellow countrymen.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.342
Italians over here.

24:28.885 --> 24:29.886
Spanish speakers there,

24:30.970 --> 24:31.804
English there.

24:31.929 --> 24:32.763
Yes.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.182
French.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.773
When we were boys
and the Tridentine Mass

24:42.899 --> 24:44.859
was still the only true liturgy
of the world,

24:45.484 --> 24:47.987
we would all have been
speaking Latin.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.283
But then your fellow liberals
insisted we get rid of that

24:52.408 --> 24:53.743
"dead" language.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.123
Without Rome, without
the tradition of Rome...

25:08.883 --> 25:12.678
So what, the next pope
must be Italian?

25:12.803 --> 25:13.721
Why not?

25:13.846 --> 25:16.724
We haven't had an Italian pope for more
than 40 years. 40 years, Tommaso.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.022
Can you seriously imagine
the alternative?

25:33.574 --> 25:38.037
Excuse me, I must circulate
amongst our brothers.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.833
The abyss calls out.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.405
Thank you, Sisters.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.977
Dear Brothers in Christ,

35:05.562 --> 35:08.315
at the moment of great
uncertainty,

35:08.440 --> 35:10.484
in the history of
the Holy Church,

35:10.818 --> 35:15.030
we must think first of
the late Holy Father,

35:15.781 --> 35:20.118
whose brilliant pontificate
was a gift from God,

35:20.786 --> 35:26.166
now we must ask our Lord to
send us a new Holy Father,

35:26.542 --> 35:31.380
through the pastoral solicitude
of the cardinal fathers.

35:32.548 --> 35:37.177
And we must pray to God for
that loving assistance,

35:37.719 --> 35:39.805
and ask Him to guide us

35:40.722 --> 35:44.017
to the right choice.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.226
My God, My God, why are you
forsaken me?

40:22.838 --> 40:26.424
And I, Irumbus Cardinal
Nakitanda,

40:27.259 --> 40:32.055
I promise, I vow and I swear
so God will help me

40:32.514 --> 40:37.185
and these Holy Gospels of God,
which I touch with my hand.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.415
Out, everyone.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.494
Cardinal brothers,

42:18.203 --> 42:21.206
we will now proceed to
the first ballot.

42:21.873 --> 42:25.627
You will find in front of you
your ballot paper.

42:26.169 --> 42:30.674
On the top half is written,
"I elect as Supreme Pontiff."

42:31.424 --> 42:35.553
Please make sure your
handwriting is legible.

43:06.501 --> 43:10.463
I call as my witness Christ
the Lord who will be my judge

43:10.964 --> 43:14.718
that my vote is given to
the one who, before God,

43:14.843 --> 43:17.262
I think should be elected.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.343
The first vote is cast for
Cardinal Tedesco.

44:03.183 --> 44:06.936
The second vote is cast for
Cardinal Tedesco.

44:09.439 --> 44:10.815
Cardinal Tremblay.

45:07.705 --> 45:10.750
And finally, Cardinal Benitez.

45:13.336 --> 45:18.007
The results of
the first ballot are...

45:18.508 --> 45:21.678
Cardinal Adeyemi,
21 votes.

45:22.846 --> 45:26.057
Cardinal Tedesco,
18 votes.

45:27.434 --> 45:30.645
Cardinal Bellini,
17 votes.

45:31.271 --> 45:34.149
Cardinal Tremblay,
16 votes.

45:34.983 --> 45:37.444
Cardinal Lawrence, 5 votes.

45:38.445 --> 45:43.450
Other cardinals assigned
a single vote, 31 votes

45:57.464 --> 45:58.756
My brother cardinals,

45:58.882 --> 46:01.718
that concludes the first ballot.

46:02.427 --> 46:04.554
No candidate having achieved

46:04.679 --> 46:07.932
the necessary majority
of 72 votes,

46:08.266 --> 46:11.478
we shall adjourn for
the evening,

46:11.603 --> 46:14.772
and resume voting in
the morning.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.483
Thank you.

55:16.063 --> 55:20.026
The results of the second
ballot are...

55:20.526 --> 55:24.030
Cardinal Adeyemi,
34 votes.

55:25.531 --> 55:28.242
Cardinal Tedesco,
25 votes.

55:30.244 --> 55:33.080

55:34.749 --> 55:38.002

16 votes.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.049
Cardinal Lawrence, 9 votes.

55:44.592 --> 55:47.178
Cardinal Benitez, 2 votes.

55:54.185 --> 55:59.065
My brothers, in accordance with
the Apostolic Constitution,

55:59.190 --> 56:03.110
we proceed immediately
to the next vote.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.236
Thank you.

56:12.286 --> 56:15.998
The results of
the third ballot are...

56:16.457 --> 56:20.211
Cardinal Adeyemi,
52 votes.

56:21.754 --> 56:24.340
Cardinal Tedesco,

56:25.257 --> 56:27.718
Cardinal Tremblay,
10 votes.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.304
Cardinal Bellini...

56:43.692 --> 56:44.527
Brothers.

56:45.277 --> 56:46.112
Please.

56:47.530 --> 56:48.364
Thank you.

56:51.033 --> 56:53.911
Cardinal Bellini, 9 votes.

56:55.037 --> 56:57.623
Cardinal Lawrence, 5 votes.

56:58.791 --> 57:01.794
Cardinal Benitez, 4 votes.

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:31.613
The results of
the fifth ballot are...

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.909

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.163

Cardinal Adeyemi, 9 votes.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.265
Cardinal Benitez, 6 votes.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.269
My brothers...

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.731
My brothers, that concludes
the fifth ballot.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.985
No candidate having achieved
the necessary majority,

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:13.280
we shall resume voting
tomorrow morning.

01:27:26.951 --> 01:27:29.536
If I may join this amiable
dialogue.

01:27:29.662 --> 01:27:31.080
I want to remind you that

01:27:31.205 --> 01:27:34.667
the names of eight cardinals
have been obscured.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:39.088
I assume the dean can tell us
who they are?

01:27:39.213 --> 01:27:40.798
Let them tell us themselves

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.341
here and now.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.385
Here and now!

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:49.807
No, I won't do that.

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:33.994
Judas.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:35.788
Traitor.

01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:33.895
Well, then.

01:35:34.354 --> 01:35:38.942
Here at last we see the result of
the doctrine of relativism

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:42.320
so beloved by our liberal
brothers!

01:35:44.281 --> 01:35:48.702
A relativism that sees all
faiths and passing fancies

01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:50.954
accorded equal weight.

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:53.290
So that now, when we look
around us, we see the homeland

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:55.208
of the Holy Roman
Catholic Church

01:35:56.001 --> 01:35:59.004
dotted with the mosques
and minarets

01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:00.255
of the prophet Muhammad!

01:36:04.426 --> 01:36:08.513
We tolerate Islam in our land,

01:36:08.889 --> 01:36:10.390
but they revile us in theirs.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.810
We nourish them
in our homelands.

01:36:14.728 --> 01:36:16.062
But they exterminate us.

01:36:16.188 --> 01:36:19.232
How long will we persist in
this weakness?

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:21.902
They are literally at our walls
right now.

01:36:22.027 --> 01:36:25.238
What we need now is a leader
who understands

01:36:25.363 --> 01:36:29.117
that we are facing
a true religious war.

01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:30.785
Do not touch me!

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:34.247
Yes, a religious war.

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:37.292
We need a leader who will
put a stop to the drift

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:40.295
that has gone on almost ceaselessly
for the past 50 years.

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.589
How long will we have to
persist in this weakness,

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:43.632
how long?

01:36:43.757 --> 01:36:45.800
We need a leader...

01:37:48.113 --> 01:37:49.531
The thing you're fighting is here...

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.451
inside each and every one of us,

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.496
if we give in to hate now,

01:37:58.248 --> 01:37:59.833
if we speak of "sides"

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:02.752
instead of speaking
for every man and woman.

01:38:05.088 --> 01:38:07.340
This is my first time here, amongst you,

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.676
and I suppose it will be my last.

01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:17.309
Forgive me, but these last few days
we have shown ourselves to be small petty men,

01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:21.855
we have seemed concerned
only with ourselves,

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:24.190
with Rome,

01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:26.568
with these elections, with power.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:30.780
But things are not the Church.

01:38:32.866 --> 01:38:34.534
The Church is not tradition.

01:38:35.619 --> 01:38:37.329
The Church is not the past.

01:38:39.873 --> 01:38:42.417
The Church is what we do next.

01:40:16.678 --> 01:40:17.846
We pray.

01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:22.100
O Father, so that we may guide

01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:25.645
and watch over Your Church.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:27.480
Give to us, Your servants,

01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:31.317
the blessings of intelligence,
truth and peace,

01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:35.989
so that we may strive to know
Your will,

01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:40.076
and serve You
total dedication.

01:40:43.079 --> 01:40:45.081
For Christ our Lord.

01:43:35.835 --> 01:43:41.132
Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?

01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:55.605
Do you accept your canonical
election as Supreme Pontiff?

01:44:03.154 --> 01:44:04.113
I accept.

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:09.452
And by what name do you
wish to be called?

01:44:14.582 --> 01:44:16.000
Innocent.

01:46:25.171 --> 01:46:27.465
Eminence, His Holiness
won't get robed.

01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:28.508
With permission.

01:46:37.058 --> 01:46:38.476
Gentlemen, let's clear the room.
