<i>We have India
114, 116, and 260 in position.</i>

01:40.143 --> 01:43.980
<i>Flight 104 is 500 yards in
trail, waiting for your go.</i>

01:44.147 --> 01:47.317
That's it, right there.
There's our guy.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.944
<i>Begin your final
approach to the target.</i>

01:50.111 --> 01:51.946
<i>Flight 104, copy that.</i>

02:15.845 --> 02:16.846
Shit!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.141
Walter, wake up. Customs.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.225
What? Who?

02:21.309 --> 02:23.561
We need the fucking bag.
Where the fuck is the key?

02:25.021 --> 02:27.440
Tighten that line.
Now secure the other side.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.150
Easy, easy up.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.443
Okay, okay.

02:30.902 --> 02:33.905
Hurry up. Come on,
put it in the bag.

02:34.113 --> 02:35.406
Come on!

02:38.576 --> 02:42.455
Pull this up.
Come on, come on. Let's go!

02:44.957 --> 02:46.125
Go, Andy.

02:53.383 --> 02:55.134
Stop!
Federal officer! Don't move!

03:33.131 --> 03:35.967
Excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can
I have everybody's attention?

03:36.134 --> 03:39.053
I want to do a quick toast to the
bride and groom, Danny and Shelly.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.388
Congratulations.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.979
I can't believe it, man.
I'm fucking married, Chris.

03:48.146 --> 03:51.816
Danny, I know. I was standing
right there with you.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.651
Look, what about
this fucking guy?

03:53.818 --> 03:55.903
He's my best friend,
best man at my wedding.

03:55.987 --> 03:58.239
He doesn't even remember that
this is where my reception was.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.490
Thank God he's sober.

03:59.574 --> 04:00.575
You don't remember?

04:00.658 --> 04:02.243
I remember throwing up
on Kate's shoes.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.162
Yeah, I remember, too.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.413
I apologized for that.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.917
Everybody, do it like this.

04:14.672 --> 04:18.134
I mean, you were like the
Lennon and McCartney of smuggling.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.262
How do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari?
Where do you hide it?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.346
We didn't.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.599
We let customs
seize it in port.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.142
Give me your phone.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.602
You take the guts out.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.354
The transmission,
the wiring system.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.982
Take all that shit out, hide
it inside other containers.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.151
So, when customs
auctions off the car,

04:35.234 --> 04:37.445
he gets himself a Ferrari
for next to nothing.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.071
He just bought the empty shell?

04:39.197 --> 04:42.366
Yes, he got the empty
shell at the auction.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.076
And then we...

04:44.202 --> 04:45.912
Sell him the missing parts.
...sold him back the guts.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.040
And he's got himself
a new Ferrari

04:49.165 --> 04:51.375
for less than you paid for
that piece-of-shit Honda.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.585
It's a nice Honda.

04:52.710 --> 04:53.961
Yeah, that's why you
live in it, right?

04:54.045 --> 04:55.296
Because it's a
nice fucking Honda.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.506
Can I dance with my wife?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.677
Hey, what's up, buddy?

05:02.845 --> 05:04.847
Can I get another one of
these when you get a chance?

05:04.931 --> 05:06.390
Hey, Chris.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.558
Church, hey.

05:07.725 --> 05:08.851
How are you doing, man?

05:08.935 --> 05:10.436
Long time, no see.
Where you been?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.648
Well, I'm living
out in Algiers now.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.067
The fuck are you
doing out there?

05:16.818 --> 05:17.985
It's nice, I like it out there.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.570
It's good for the family.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.323
A guy like you don't
belong in Algiers, Chris.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.826
What are you doing for work?

05:25.868 --> 05:28.746
I started my own business,
setting up alarm systems.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.751
Fill that up, will you?

05:36.754 --> 05:39.465
Your old man getting
jailed freak you out? Huh?

05:41.843 --> 05:43.177
I guess.

05:43.261 --> 05:46.597
That, and having a wife and
two little boys, you know?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.183
Yeah.

05:49.517 --> 05:52.603
You've got to stick to what
you're good at, though, Chris.

05:55.064 --> 05:59.735
Listen, I offered to take care of
that ship captain for your dad.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.446
He said no.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.784
Anyway, Chris, if you're ever
thinking of getting back in,

06:06.868 --> 06:08.870
let me know, okay?

06:09.620 --> 06:10.746
Yeah?

06:10.913 --> 06:11.998
Yeah.
Good.

06:17.128 --> 06:20.631
I don't even know why we're
doing this in the first place.

06:21.716 --> 06:25.428
Just trust me, okay?
It will be cool.

06:26.429 --> 06:29.223
If we try to run,
it will make it worse.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.618
Where are these guys?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.417
Here we go, here we go.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.346
Be cool, now.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.310
Here we go, here we go.

07:17.647 --> 07:19.148
Hey, man.

07:20.191 --> 07:23.319
Customs boarded us,
we had to dump the package.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.865
You did?

07:29.367 --> 07:30.660
We had no choice.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.121
Right?

07:34.997 --> 07:36.999
Nothing we could do, man.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.389
That's it.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.600
What did I say?
I told you it was cool.

07:54.684 --> 07:56.894
Come on, man, let's
get the fuck out of here.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.287
Hello?

08:17.498 --> 08:18.541
It's my brother.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.751
What happened?
Is he okay?

08:20.918 --> 08:23.337
No. We've got to go now.

08:23.421 --> 08:24.588
What?

08:34.597 --> 08:35.808
Walter is in surgery.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.559
What the fuck happened, Andy?

08:42.023 --> 08:43.190
It was an accident.

08:43.274 --> 08:46.360
You know what? You're a shitty
liar, so don't even fucking try.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.654
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.074
I was running something.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.371
We got boarded,
and I dumped it.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.832
You dumped what?

09:01.250 --> 09:02.293
The coke.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.627
KATE; Oh, fuck.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.087
It was over 10 pounds.

09:07.757 --> 09:08.758
For who?

09:08.924 --> 09:10.634
For Tim Briggs

09:11.385 --> 09:12.970
and those guys.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.138
They're going to kill me.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.891
Andy, they're not
going to kill you.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.060
It was a lot of stuff.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.022
I'm sorry.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.525
You should be fucking sorry.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.403
Is he all right?

09:29.487 --> 09:31.072
No, the little fuckhead
was running something

09:31.155 --> 09:32.740
and he dumped it.
Now he owes.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.408
Who? Who does he owe?

09:34.492 --> 09:35.743
Tim Briggs.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.912
Ask around, see what you
can find out, all right?

09:38.204 --> 09:39.663
How is Kate?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.082
Not good.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.170
I can't believe he did that.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.381
When I quit, I told him to
stay away from these guys.

09:49.548 --> 09:52.134
Please, if you had anything to do
with this, just tell me right now.

09:52.218 --> 09:53.260
I just told you.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.595
Okay.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.351
He's my little brother.

10:00.518 --> 10:03.145
I know. I'm going to
take care of it.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.293
I got you..

10:31.298 --> 10:32.383
I'll call you in the morning.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.051
Okay, no problem.

10:34.135 --> 10:35.427
Good night.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.754
So you said King
Security put the system in?

11:10.838 --> 11:13.257
That's right.
A lot of good it did.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.843
It's a decent system,
but your locks are a joke.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.179
Anybody who knows
the response time

11:18.262 --> 11:19.847
is going to be able
to get in and out.

11:21.432 --> 11:22.975
Can you excuse me
for one second, sir?

11:23.058 --> 11:24.018
Yes.

11:24.143 --> 11:26.103
<i>It's
about Briggs, Kyle's brother.</i>

11:26.187 --> 11:27.188
<i>Yeah, and?</i>

11:27.271 --> 11:28.689
I don't know, hold on.

11:28.856 --> 11:32.067
Guys! Guys!
How are we doing today?

11:32.234 --> 11:35.613
Is my office still going
to be done last week?

11:35.696 --> 11:37.364
You having a nice morning?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.532
Good!

11:38.699 --> 11:40.743
Briggs got out of
prison two months ago.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.328
He hangs out
at the Old Point Bar.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.997
I'll pop over there after I'm done
work and see if I can talk to him.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.249
Sorry about that, sir.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.293
The cameras are nice and small,

11:49.376 --> 11:50.794
they'll fit right up
there in the corner.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.995
Oh, shit!

12:25.079 --> 12:29.166
Chris Farraday, back from
the dead, man! Yeah!

12:29.541 --> 12:31.752
Good to see you, man.

12:32.211 --> 12:35.297
Oh, shit. This man was
a world-class smuggler here.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.800
You were fucking Houdini, man.

12:38.342 --> 12:42.263
Yeah, he used to run with my brother,
God rest his miserable soul.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.641
Too bad your skill
didn't rub off

12:45.724 --> 12:47.184
on your shithead
brother-in-law.

12:47.268 --> 12:48.644
No, I know,
he's a fuck-up.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.688
Mmm. But he's my
wife's little brother.

12:51.272 --> 12:52.606
I was hoping you
understand it's family,

12:52.690 --> 12:54.024
maybe we could
work something out.

12:54.108 --> 12:56.110
Well, I don't know.
What do you want to work out?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.945
You want to work out
something with me?

12:58.070 --> 13:00.030
I can figure out a way to
pay you back the buy money.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.284
No, that's worth
700 grand to me.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.119
Oh, come on, man.
No, come on, man.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.579
You're going to try to charge
me full freight for a bad run?

13:07.663 --> 13:10.457
Customs boards the boat, you dump that shit.
You know how it goes.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.085
You know how many passes I
gave your brother in his day?

13:13.210 --> 13:14.837
Yeah, I hated my brother.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.548
What do you want to do,
a payment plan?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.091
What, do I look like
a bank to you?

13:19.174 --> 13:21.343
No, I was just hoping you could
be fucking reasonable, here.

13:21.427 --> 13:23.637
Hey! This ain't your
world any more, man!

13:24.138 --> 13:27.474
You're a tourist, you can't
trade on status you don't have.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.768
I got bills to pay.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.646
You know, when people fuck that
up, that's their fucking problem.

13:32.730 --> 13:35.733
You think that's funny?
You got bills?

13:42.573 --> 13:44.283
I like your outfit.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.328
I liked your brother.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.751
We're here today,
that's the important thing.

13:54.043 --> 13:56.670
So, you know, learning to
let go and let God

13:56.754 --> 13:59.340
is what's been pulling me
through all of this.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.512
You're going to have to talk me
down before I fucking kill Briggs.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.556
Probably be better off.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.350
I'm one drink away from
the worst day of my life.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.518
What should I do?

14:11.602 --> 14:14.271
...sitting in this circle
that's had that same thought, right?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.815
That's all you gotta do,
is work the steps.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.817
I'm not doing another run.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.652
No fucking way.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.989
I could probably get us
the buy money, no problem.

14:24.073 --> 14:25.324
No, I finally got
something going.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.242
I'm not going to
chance fucking it up.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.288
It's not going away, Chris.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.041
Does somebody want to share?

14:34.208 --> 14:36.168
Sebastian? Want to share
a little bit with us?

14:36.251 --> 14:38.003
Okay.
Oh, yeah.

14:38.087 --> 14:39.088
Go do your thing.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.256
You don't want to stick around?

14:41.340 --> 14:43.759
No, I get far too emotional
hearing that story.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.803
How are you doing, Sebastian?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.270
What the hell happened?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.648
Walter died last night.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.318
Briggs came to the hospital.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.487
He said it was all on me.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.198
I keep getting calls, Chris,

15:06.281 --> 15:09.743
and they're talking about how they're
going to fucking torture me.

15:09.827 --> 15:12.996
I'm shipping out in the next couple of days.
I'm not coming back.

15:14.123 --> 15:17.960
Do me a favor, and don't tell Kate.
Not until I'm gone.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.545
When I stopped doing runs,

15:19.628 --> 15:21.088
you promised me you were
gonna stay out of this shit.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.339
What do you want me
to say, man?

15:22.423 --> 15:23.465
Not a fucking word!

15:25.134 --> 15:28.679
I didn't have anybody to tell
me I was fucking up. You do!

15:29.680 --> 15:31.682
And you put your sister
and the boys in this shit?

15:31.807 --> 15:33.517
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

16:21.899 --> 16:22.900
Whoa.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.986
You don't come
to my fucking place.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.279
I just came to tell you

16:27.362 --> 16:28.530
that I'm going to have
your money within a month.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.656
Just stay away from Andy.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.074
I ain't waiting that long.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.244
Well, I ain't paying
if he's dead.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.289
If a guy dies owing something,

16:37.372 --> 16:38.790
his family inherits the debt.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.834
So I'll give you two weeks.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.879
If not, I'm going to come
after the both of you.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.172
Then, all the way
down the line.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.633
I'll come asking your
wife for it, your kids...

16:54.598 --> 16:57.351
Do you think you're the only
guy with a fucking gun?

16:57.476 --> 16:59.061
You'll get your fucking money.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.938
But if you ever mention my wife

17:01.021 --> 17:02.856
and my kids again, you're done.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.983
You hear me?
You are fucking done!

17:06.151 --> 17:07.444
Daddy.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.571
It's okay, sweetie.
Go back inside.

17:10.656 --> 17:13.492
It's okay, sweetie. Daddy and
I were just playing, okay?

17:13.617 --> 17:15.285
It's okay.
Yeah, we're just playing.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.663
Yeah, me and Daddy
were just fucking playing.

17:17.788 --> 17:18.955
Get up there.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.791
Yeah, we'll play again.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.292
Daddy is okay.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.671
It's all right.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.716
What the fuck
are you looking at?

17:53.532 --> 17:55.492
You stay in the car,
I'll go talk to her.

17:55.659 --> 17:56.702
Okay.

18:07.296 --> 18:08.755
Hey, Chris.
Hey, how are you?

18:09.881 --> 18:10.882
Hi.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.050
Hey.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.510
Everything okay?

18:13.677 --> 18:15.762
Yeah, I just wanted to
talk to you for a minute.

18:15.846 --> 18:16.847
Okay.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.109
I got to get on the ship with
Andy and try to fix this.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.278
Are you fucking kidding?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.821
What am I going to do,
let him go alone?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.406
No, we're going to
think of something else.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.491
There's nothing
else to do, okay?

18:36.575 --> 18:37.701
I hate to tell you,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.620
but that little
dumb fuck has put us

18:39.703 --> 18:41.538
in the worst
possible position, okay?

18:41.622 --> 18:44.166
And if they don't get the money
from him, they're coming after us.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.459
So what else
do you want me to do?

18:45.542 --> 18:46.835
You know what
I don't want to do?

18:46.918 --> 18:49.755
I don't want to fucking visit you in
jail like we're visiting your dad,

18:49.838 --> 18:51.048
and raising
those kids on my own.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.549
So it's my...

18:54.217 --> 18:56.386
I don't want to fight with
you about this, okay?

18:56.511 --> 18:59.431
I know what I'm doing,
all right?

18:59.514 --> 19:01.475
Will you just trust me?

19:02.643 --> 19:04.186
Please?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.272
Nothing is going to happen.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.941
All right? I promise.
Mmm.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.085
<i>That shitbag Briggs was
here for a couple of years.</i>

19:28.752 --> 19:31.922
He tried to smash some guy's
head in with a cinder block.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.132
Look, I mentioned
this to Sebastian.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.718
We're doing another run.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.303
Can you get me
on your old boat?

19:38.762 --> 19:40.597
You mean the Borden?

19:41.556 --> 19:43.850
Remember when you
were little, you and Sebastian,

19:44.351 --> 19:46.853
you broke into
McTier's warehouse

19:46.937 --> 19:49.106
stole all that
Mardi Gras jewelry,

19:49.690 --> 19:52.484
and you came back to the house with
a great big box of them beads?

19:52.859 --> 19:54.778
You thought they were diamonds.

19:54.903 --> 19:58.782
You were grinning like
you just won the fucking lottery.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.785
And you said,

20:01.952 --> 20:04.955
"You don't have to work
on that boat no more."

20:08.125 --> 20:10.293
I always think about that.

20:12.629 --> 20:16.508
The proudest day of my life
was when you turned legit,

20:17.426 --> 20:21.304
and you started your own business,
and you got out of the life.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.810
I know you got to do
what you got to do.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.770
I got it.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.567
Family is family.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.403
I'll get you on the boat.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.947
But you get in,

20:40.824 --> 20:42.868
you got to get back out.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.079
Me and Andy are shipping
out to Panama with the Borden.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.164
The old man's boat?

20:47.289 --> 20:48.248
Yeah, he got us on.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.499
What about Captain Camp?

20:49.624 --> 20:51.251
I know. I know.
Don't worry about it.

20:54.588 --> 20:55.589
What's this?

20:55.672 --> 20:56.673
What's what?

20:56.798 --> 20:58.925
Every time I come here,
you got new shit.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.511
I'm getting it together,
I'm getting the place ready.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.180
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.098
That is not for shoes.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.350
I must be out of touch. I don't
know what's bad-ass any more

21:07.476 --> 21:09.436
because this looks
cheap-ass.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.062
You're turning
into <i>The Birdcage.</i>

21:11.146 --> 21:12.147
I mean...

21:14.316 --> 21:15.734
So who do we know in Panama?

21:16.359 --> 21:18.403
Are you going to go see Ruben?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.071
Dude, no drugs.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.532
What else has that
kind of profit margin?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.242
Edwin is in Panama.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.535
Currency?

21:25.619 --> 21:28.121
We have to bring back a shit-ton
to make it worth our while.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.290
All right, so I'll
bring back a shit-ton.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.627
Okay, 15 million on
four stacks this big.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.295
It's like the size
of a Mini Cooper.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.463
Where are you going to hide it?

21:36.546 --> 21:38.006
That's my problem.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.716
I need the Borden's
crew manifest.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.848
Oh, God. You got to be
kidding me.

21:48.517 --> 21:51.895
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a
horrible chef, but he's great on runs.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.231
Le Cloud's a fucking drunk.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.650
Newlywed?

21:56.733 --> 21:59.069
He's not great on runs, but
we've known him a long time.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.739
Olaf's solid, we need
somebody in the engine room.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.617
Well, it's no A-Team,
but it's the best we can do.

22:05.700 --> 22:09.037
Come on, work your magic. Make
the call, get me a TWIC card.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.418
Hi, sweet pea.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.255
<i>I need you to push through a
TWIC card for Chris Farraday.</i>

22:22.217 --> 22:24.928
I got your message. It only took
you three years to call me?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.429
<i>Are you back in business?</i>

22:26.513 --> 22:27.556
No, no, no, no, no.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.807
I need something, though.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.101
Remember our last run?
The funny money?

22:31.810 --> 22:34.437
<i>I need that exact same shit
by next week, but a lot more.</i>

22:34.563 --> 22:36.189
<i>Four times as much.</i>

22:36.273 --> 22:37.566
And we need a van big enough
to transport it, okay?

22:38.066 --> 22:40.277
Okay. I'll be here.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.612
Come on, Mikey!

22:42.779 --> 22:43.822
What's funny money?

22:43.905 --> 22:46.575
Huh? Nothing. That's
just work stuff for Dad.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.245
Have you ever been
convicted of espionage?

22:51.246 --> 22:53.415
Just answer yes or no, we'll get
through this really quickly.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.541
No.

22:54.624 --> 22:59.129
Sedition, or conspiracy to commit
espionage, sedition, treason?

22:59.296 --> 23:00.463
Together?

23:01.631 --> 23:04.384
I received your
shipping application, Mr...

23:04.467 --> 23:05.635
Lakowski.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.596
<i>Mr. Lakowski.</i>

23:07.679 --> 23:11.933
<i>Señor</i> Lakowski, I'm getting
you a 20-foot standard dry.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.560
Would you like us to load it?

23:13.643 --> 23:16.271
No, I've got somebody to take care of that.
I just need the container.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.606
<i>Okay, we'll leave the container</i>

23:17.689 --> 23:19.441
<i>standing by for you
at the port of Panama.</i>

23:19.524 --> 23:20.734
<i>And what are you shipping?</i>

23:20.817 --> 23:21.985
A van.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.005
Here you go.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.386
It takes money
to make money, baby.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.226
Thank you.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.195
Don't sink, Daddy.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.529
Okay, buddy.

24:07.697 --> 24:09.449
You're going to
miss my playoff game.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.701
I know. I'm sorry.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.329
Your mom is going to take lots
of pictures for me, okay?

24:14.412 --> 24:16.623
You guys are in charge
till I get back.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.583
I love you, guys.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.341
Just come home, okay?

24:28.051 --> 24:29.594
Thank you for
doing this, Chris.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.346
I love you.
Love you, too.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.223
It's going to be okay.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.020
ID, please.
Finger on the scanner.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.311
Captain Camp.
Get the trunk.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.941
Get that Captain's carpet
cleaner up to the bridge.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.235
John,
you want to give me a hand?

25:43.460 --> 25:44.753
Hey!

25:45.336 --> 25:46.713
You're up top.
I get the bottom bunk.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.298
Yeah, no kidding.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.978
Don't act like
you don't like this shit.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.607
Why, is it that obvious?

26:06.274 --> 26:07.984
I love it, but don't
tell your sister.

26:11.488 --> 26:14.199
All right, come on. You can get
your beauty rest later, let's go.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.325
My arm, my arm.

26:24.501 --> 26:26.002
Keep an eye out.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.890
Hey, someone's coming.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.036
What's up, Chris?

27:00.203 --> 27:01.329
Hi, Chris.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.831
Chris.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.125
Look at this motherfucker.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.169
Olaf.
Good to see you, man.

27:08.253 --> 27:09.379
What's up, Tarik?
You okay?

27:09.462 --> 27:10.463
What's up, man?

27:10.922 --> 27:12.799
How's your folks? Everybody's good?
Good, good.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.175
That's a hungry man's appetite.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.301
This is real good.

27:15.385 --> 27:16.386
How you doing, buddy?

27:21.224 --> 27:23.434
What the fuck are
you doing on my ship?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.562
Did you even check
the goddamn crew manifest?

27:25.645 --> 27:27.981
How the fuck do you let Bud
Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?

27:28.064 --> 27:30.066
DHS cleared him. He was
added at the last minute.

27:30.150 --> 27:31.401
All right, I'm demoting
him to ship's boy.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.485
Yes, sir.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.905
You scrub dirt and stay
the fuck out of my sight.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.824
Otherwise you might
have an accident,

27:37.907 --> 27:39.325
and wind up in the drink.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.163
Show him where
the carpet cleaner is.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.497
Yes, sir.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.249
Oh, man, carpet cleaner.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.795
Let's go, Rug Doctor.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.175
Oh, you got promoted? They gave
you some new stripes on there.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.510
I'll be ship's boy. You're
still Captain's bitch boy.

27:57.594 --> 27:58.595
Yeah, yeah.

28:41.930 --> 28:42.889
Okay.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.307
Yes, sir.

29:21.010 --> 29:24.013
Everybody's drinking tall boys,
and nobody's fucking working.

29:24.347 --> 29:25.306
What's up, man?

29:25.390 --> 29:26.641
Are you bringing the Captain
in on this or what?

29:26.724 --> 29:27.725
Fuck, no.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.354
Well, I remember talking to
your pops in this same room.

29:31.521 --> 29:34.023
He said that same shit.
We know how that turned out.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.525
Do you trust me or not?

29:35.692 --> 29:37.819
I do. I do.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.112
So what are we running?

29:39.195 --> 29:43.533
A shipping pallet loaded up with
5,000 uncut sheets of super notes.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.118
Best counterfeit money can buy.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.537
And just how the hell do you think
we're going to stow that much shit?

29:47.704 --> 29:49.789
You worried, buddy?
I mean, where is the faith?

29:50.999 --> 29:52.583
What, I lost my stripes? Now
I got to start from scratch?

29:52.667 --> 29:54.335
Exactly, that shit's void.

29:54.419 --> 29:55.420
No problem.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.714
Come on, I'll show you.

30:07.724 --> 30:08.808
What do you think?

30:08.891 --> 30:11.060
Looks good. Chris,
you're a crazy fucker.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.896
Not bad? Huh?
Sixty cubic feet.

30:14.022 --> 30:17.650
No fucking way.
No, it's bigger than 60.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.194
Ah, shit! Yeah, man,
this is much bigger than 60.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.362
We got company.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.072
Quick, quick, quick!

30:23.239 --> 30:24.782
Hey, what are you doing?
Chris, stop!

30:24.866 --> 30:26.242
Andy, be quiet in there.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.582
Come on, come on!

30:33.499 --> 30:34.917
What the hell
are you doing in here?

30:35.001 --> 30:37.337
I needed a scraper. We noticed
some mold in the lower hull.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.880
The bleach wasn't
cutting it, so...

30:41.007 --> 30:43.718
Well, you shouldn't be dicking
around in here. Get going.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.928
I was just trying to keep
it clean for you, boss.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.956
Hey, Chris! Chris!

31:17.960 --> 31:20.797
Bring it right back up!
Come on, you got it!

31:20.922 --> 31:22.507
You got it, come on!

31:25.301 --> 31:26.386
I can't do it.

31:26.469 --> 31:27.470
God damn.

31:30.473 --> 31:31.682
Are you getting on?

31:31.766 --> 31:32.850
No.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.310
Do you want me to
put you back in the box?

31:34.435 --> 31:36.020
That's not funny.

31:36.104 --> 31:37.855
I could have
suffocated in that box.

31:37.939 --> 31:38.940
"I really could have..."

31:39.399 --> 31:40.900
Leave the kid alone, man.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.318
How are you going to
pull this shit off?

31:43.569 --> 31:45.405
We're delivering 300 or
so containers. Yeah.

31:45.488 --> 31:48.408
We're picking up 500 or more. We're
not going to be in port that long.

31:48.491 --> 31:51.536
So we got to drive out to Chorrillo,
see Edwin, load up the bills,

31:51.619 --> 31:53.413
and then drive back
to the boat during rush hour.

31:53.496 --> 31:54.914
It's going to be tight,
but we're going to be good.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.582
It's going to be too tight.
We're cutting it close.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.459
Might not have enough time.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.003
We'll buy more time.

32:01.504 --> 32:02.672
Controllable pitch propeller.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.091
Oh, yeah.
Pitch propeller.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.467
Can you drain the oil supply?

32:07.176 --> 32:08.469
The hydraulic chamber
won't work.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.012
That's the point, stupid ass.

32:10.888 --> 32:11.973
Look.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.434
We can do it while being
towed through the locks.

32:14.517 --> 32:15.768
It will buy us
a couple of hours.

32:15.852 --> 32:17.687
Okay?
I don't know.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.272
I hate when we fuck
with the boat.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.606
What?

32:20.690 --> 32:23.109
I said, I hate
when we fuck with the boat.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.193
Take it easy, big bear.

32:24.277 --> 32:25.445
Olaf, fuck with the boat.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.406
Take it easy. Easy.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.490
What the fuck?

32:29.574 --> 32:32.410
Tarik. That motherfucker
will eat you.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.542
Okay, out you come.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.004
Do you want to get any of these for me?
Do we have to?

32:43.087 --> 32:44.088
Yes, Mom.

32:44.172 --> 32:45.339
Yeah? Okay.

33:28.382 --> 33:29.675
Hello?

33:31.177 --> 33:32.386
Can I help you?

33:35.806 --> 33:37.350
You're pretty.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.685
Do you want to play?

33:39.852 --> 33:40.978
Okay. Bye, asshole.

33:45.149 --> 33:46.484
Pay the money,
just like you owe me.

33:46.567 --> 33:47.860
What the fuck
are you all looking at?

33:47.944 --> 33:49.237
Yeah, you like that?

33:49.320 --> 33:50.363
Get your fucking hands off me!

33:53.199 --> 33:56.536
Come on, put the knife down.
Put the knife down.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.287
Put the knife down.

33:58.454 --> 33:59.497
Leave my mommy alone!

33:59.580 --> 34:02.208
Get the fuck back over there!
Sit your fucking ass down!

34:02.291 --> 34:04.126
It's okay,
I'm just playing, now.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.795
I'm just playing.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.129
Yeah, don't cry.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.299
You seen a gun before?
You want it?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.510
There ain't going to be no playing
when I come back next week.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.178
You can tell your husband that.

34:14.262 --> 34:15.888
You want this?
Get out!

34:18.808 --> 34:20.141
- No!
- What the fuck?

34:21.185 --> 34:24.188
Get the fuck out of my house!
Get the fuck out of my house!

34:24.272 --> 34:26.148
Put that thing down, man!

34:26.232 --> 34:28.109
You don't think the police
are going to be coming now?

34:28.192 --> 34:29.485
Get the fuck out of here!

34:29.569 --> 34:31.821
I didn't mean to shoot at him.
The little shit hit the gun.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.114
You want to send me back to
the farm, you stupid bitch?

34:34.197 --> 34:36.659
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.012
All right, careful.
Not too much.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.972
We don't want to jam it.
I got it.

34:58.055 --> 34:59.307
<i>Chris Farraday, to the bridge.</i>

34:59.390 --> 35:00.683
Here.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.560
He's on his way.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.064
Not too much.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.274
All right.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.944
<i>I wasn't getting
reception on your cell.</i>

35:12.069 --> 35:14.905
Chris, these guys came to the house.
They had guns.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.742
Jesus, are you okay?
Are the boys okay?

35:18.075 --> 35:20.077
Yeah, we're okay.
We're freaked out.

35:20.536 --> 35:24.081
<i>I think one of them was Tim
Briggs, Kyle's brother.</i>

35:24.165 --> 35:26.417
<i>I didn't call the police, I don't
want them here asking questions.</i>

35:26.500 --> 35:27.543
Call Sebastian, okay?

35:29.545 --> 35:30.963
Yeah, okay, I will.

35:33.466 --> 35:35.635
All right, I love you.
Call him.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.596
Trouble with
the missus, Farraday?

35:39.639 --> 35:41.557
Do you want me
to talk to her for you?

35:51.901 --> 35:53.819
Hey, guys, you okay?
You had a scary day?

35:53.903 --> 35:54.904
Mmm-hmm.

35:56.614 --> 35:57.865
You know what?
Why don't you guys

35:57.948 --> 35:59.283
just come and stay at my place?

35:59.450 --> 36:01.494
They're not going to be back, but
just for my own peace of mind.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.578
You think?

36:04.747 --> 36:06.082
Really? Okay.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.171
Slow ahead.

36:14.382 --> 36:16.384
I said, slow ahead!
Reduce to half speed!

36:22.181 --> 36:23.474
Why are we not slowing down?

36:25.267 --> 36:26.686
Oil pressure's down.

36:26.769 --> 36:28.604
All right. Keep
an eye on that temperature.

36:28.688 --> 36:29.772
Full astern!

36:29.855 --> 36:31.565
Full astern, Captain.

36:33.609 --> 36:34.819
Yeah, Captain?
Full astern!

36:34.902 --> 36:36.070
<i>We're going to hit
the fucking dock!</i>

36:36.153 --> 36:38.864
I'm trying, but I got no pitch control.
The fucking prop is jammed!

36:41.492 --> 36:44.203
You drained too much oil out! I
didn't want you to crash the boat!

36:44.286 --> 36:45.287
What?

36:48.582 --> 36:51.669
Come on! I'm not
getting any oil pressure!

36:57.299 --> 36:58.843
Let go the port anchor!

37:02.430 --> 37:03.681
Jesus, fucking...

37:03.764 --> 37:04.974
Let go the fucking port anchor!

37:07.309 --> 37:09.103
Did you release the brake?

37:09.854 --> 37:11.397
Get out of the way!
Move!

37:14.567 --> 37:15.651
Tu rn starboard!

37:15.735 --> 37:18.320
It's too late! Hard to port, Luke!
Hard to port!

37:26.454 --> 37:28.164
I'm going to have
to kill the engine!

37:36.839 --> 37:38.090
Fucking...

37:52.813 --> 37:53.814
We're going to hit!

38:07.119 --> 38:09.288
What the fuck is
going on around here?

38:13.375 --> 38:14.418
What the fuck happened?

38:14.502 --> 38:15.544
Propeller jam.

38:16.545 --> 38:17.880
Someone tampered with it.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.256
I don't think so.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.134
Someone tampered with it.

39:04.844 --> 39:06.178
Sorry about that oil thing.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.847
Don't worry about it.

39:08.389 --> 39:09.640
It will buy us
a little more time.

39:14.103 --> 39:17.273
Hey, Michael, look. It's
like a spaceship over here.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.567
Wow, Sebastian,
it's amazing in here.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.151
Yeah?
It's coming along, right?

39:21.277 --> 39:22.862
I forgot you haven't been
here since the renovation.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.780
Hey, don't touch that.

39:26.657 --> 39:30.119
Fellas, you hang on to this.

39:30.286 --> 39:32.204
Okay, that's good.

39:35.833 --> 39:36.834
Good aim.

39:39.295 --> 39:40.713
Hey, everything okay?

39:40.796 --> 39:42.047
<i>Yeah we're at Sebastian's.</i>

39:42.298 --> 39:43.382
<i>Are the boys okay?</i>

39:43.465 --> 39:45.801
Yeah. Are you
in Panama already?

39:45.885 --> 39:47.595
<i>Yeah. Keep
your phone on you.</i>

39:47.678 --> 39:48.679
I love you.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.515
I love you, too. I'll
call you on my way back.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.853
We're almost there.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.813
Hey!
Whoa!

40:40.189 --> 40:41.732
You got a lot of pussy in here.

40:41.815 --> 40:43.150
Good to see you, man.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.860
Everything good?
Yeah.

40:44.944 --> 40:46.236
Good, you got
the cash, the van?

40:46.403 --> 40:47.655
<i>Sí, sí.</i>
Cool.

40:47.821 --> 40:48.822
Yeah.

41:06.715 --> 41:07.716
Whoa.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.146
What, you don't trust me?

41:21.313 --> 41:22.773
Oh, I trust you.

41:30.906 --> 41:31.907
<i>¿Está bueno?</i>

41:34.785 --> 41:36.453
No, it's no fucking <i>bueno.</i>

41:36.620 --> 41:38.914
Andy, wait here.
Danny, come on.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.551
Hey, what is it?
What are you doing?

41:50.634 --> 41:51.844
I need some iodine.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.137
The ink is OVI,
the layers are right,

41:53.220 --> 41:54.221
but that paper felt different.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.848
Hey, <i>¿qué pasa?</i>
What's going on?

41:55.931 --> 41:57.099
You better hope I'm wrong.

42:13.449 --> 42:16.160
You fucking idiots didn't print
this on starch-free paper.

42:16.243 --> 42:17.870
I'm sorry, man.
This is the best I have.

42:17.953 --> 42:19.079
I don't have time for this.

42:19.163 --> 42:20.748
I told you on the phone,

42:20.831 --> 42:22.833
I needed exactly what
you sold me last time.

42:23.292 --> 42:26.503
Gonzalo. Gonzalo has
it at the warehouse.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.589
Gonzalo? That little shithead
who works for Jesus?

42:28.672 --> 42:31.050
No. There's no more Jesus.

42:31.508 --> 42:32.634
Gonzalo is running things now.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.720
Why didn't you send me to
him in the first place?

42:34.803 --> 42:37.389
Are you fucking playing games with me?
Are you fucking playing...

42:37.473 --> 42:40.768
I tried! But he doesn't
want anybody going there!

42:40.851 --> 42:41.935
No, no, no.

42:42.019 --> 42:43.020
We're going to the warehouse.
Let's go.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.104
No, no, no, no, no.

42:44.188 --> 42:45.189
Chris.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.816
Hey, Chris, man, look,
take the van, man. I'm sorry.

42:47.983 --> 42:49.651
Come on, Mikey!

42:52.279 --> 42:53.739
Man, the sun's
really killing me.

42:53.822 --> 42:55.741
That kid is big. He is.
Number 11 is a big kid.

42:55.824 --> 42:57.159
Hold on, I got to take this.

42:57.284 --> 42:58.327
Okay.

43:00.662 --> 43:02.081
Hey, man, what's up?

43:02.623 --> 43:03.665
He didn't have them.

43:03.749 --> 43:04.833
<i>All right.</i>

43:05.834 --> 43:08.170
Well, I guess you're going to
have to bring in some candy.

43:08.670 --> 43:09.838
I'm not bringing in drugs.

43:09.922 --> 43:10.923
Just go and see Ruben.

43:11.006 --> 43:13.592
I told you, I'm not bringing in drugs.
Okay. It's not an option.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.511
Chris, Chris, Chris,
I'm begging you. Please.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.638
Chris? Yeah, Chris?

43:17.971 --> 43:19.348
Put him in the fucking van.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.725
You know,
you come back empty-handed,

43:21.809 --> 43:23.185
<i>Andy's going to
get fucking hit,</i>

43:23.268 --> 43:25.145
<i>and you're still gonna have to
come up with the goddamn money.</i>

43:25.521 --> 43:27.523
Look, I'll figure it out, okay?

43:27.689 --> 43:29.358
Just keep Briggs
away from my family, please.

43:29.441 --> 43:30.776
Yeah, of course.

43:34.613 --> 43:36.949
Hey, I got a little problem at
work I got to take care of.

43:37.533 --> 43:38.617
See you later, buddy.

43:38.700 --> 43:39.743
Bye, Sebastian.
Everything okay?

43:39.827 --> 43:41.328
Yeah, everything's fine.
You got your key?

43:41.411 --> 43:42.454
Yeah.

43:46.083 --> 43:49.169
I'm telling you, man.
Stay away from Gonzalo.

43:49.253 --> 43:52.464
He's been acting crazy lately,
since he became a boss.

43:53.173 --> 43:54.591
Stay away from him.

43:58.387 --> 43:59.763
Chris, we should
have listened to him.

43:59.847 --> 44:02.599
We got less than an hour to get back to the boat.
It ain't going to work.

44:02.683 --> 44:03.809
It will work.

44:04.935 --> 44:07.020
I mean, do you even know
where Gonzalo's warehouse is?

44:07.354 --> 44:08.647
We're in fucking
Chorrillo right now.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.440
I'm looking for
something to remind me.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.485
We're going to find it.

44:14.361 --> 44:16.488
Here we go. Here we go.
Look, right here! Here!

44:21.535 --> 44:22.828
Mortin.
Yeah, Cap?

44:22.911 --> 44:24.204
Where the hell is Farraday?

44:24.288 --> 44:25.372
I don't know, Cap.

44:25.455 --> 44:28.125
I didn't know I had to babysit him today.
I didn't get the memo.

44:28.208 --> 44:29.501
Don't piss me off, Mortin.

44:29.585 --> 44:30.961
You'll be flipping
shit-burgers at McDonald's

44:31.044 --> 44:32.462
before you can say
"minimum wage".

44:32.880 --> 44:35.174
I'm sorry, Cap. Sorry.

44:55.861 --> 44:58.363
That little visit you paid
Kate, the kids, Chris' family?

44:58.447 --> 44:59.615
That's my family.

44:59.740 --> 45:02.784
You stay away from them.
Are we clear?

45:14.880 --> 45:15.964
Hi, Sadie.

45:16.548 --> 45:17.549
Hi.

45:19.801 --> 45:22.679
You know, if you had hired a
real smuggler instead of Andy,

45:22.763 --> 45:24.890
our package would have come
in when it was supposed to.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.476
You know,
I'm really sorry about that.

45:28.018 --> 45:30.145
Do you know how fucked up
things are for me right now?

45:30.229 --> 45:31.563
I know. He said he knew
what he was doing.

45:31.647 --> 45:35.400
I didn't know
he was his brother-in-law.

46:11.561 --> 46:13.272
Hey, man,
this is way more high-risk

46:13.355 --> 46:14.815
than I originally anticipated.

46:14.898 --> 46:17.150
I got a wife now.
I like my wife.

46:17.359 --> 46:18.777
Yeah, I got a wife, too, okay?

46:19.152 --> 46:21.029
And don't worry about Gonzalo.

46:21.113 --> 46:23.031
I know him, he's a little fucking punk.
Don't worry about it.

46:23.115 --> 46:25.033
Oh, yeah? I heard
stories about this dude

46:25.117 --> 46:26.618
cutting people's
heads off and shit.

46:39.464 --> 46:40.799
I'm looking for Gonzalo.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.574
Andy, stay in the van
with the bag.

47:11.413 --> 47:14.291
Danny, it's all good.
I know this guy, come on.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.809
<i>You have one new message.</i>

47:34.311 --> 47:37.147
<i>Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching
your sister's kid play soccer.</i>

47:37.230 --> 47:38.190
<i>You don't call me back,</i>

47:38.273 --> 47:41.777
<i>I'm gonna walk out on that field
and put a bullet in his head.</i>

48:02.798 --> 48:03.799
Chris.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.258
Don't...
Stop talking.

48:05.342 --> 48:06.802
Like I said, I want you to take

48:06.885 --> 48:08.470
the buy money
and go to that address,

48:08.553 --> 48:10.430
and talk to
a gentleman named Ruben.

48:10.514 --> 48:12.516
<i>If you ever want to see
your little nephew again,</i>

48:12.599 --> 48:15.477
<i>you take the package and you
bring it back, all right?</i>

48:39.418 --> 48:40.710
Hey, is that a Wolf?

48:40.794 --> 48:42.212
That ain't no fucking dog.

48:44.965 --> 48:47.092
Excuse me, <i>señor.</i>
Do you mind?

48:55.976 --> 48:57.102
Where is he?

48:57.310 --> 48:58.812
Where is my
old friend Farraday?

48:59.688 --> 49:00.856
Bring the van around.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.607
Sorry for showing up
unannounced.

49:02.691 --> 49:04.359
Edwin was trying to
play games with me.

49:04.443 --> 49:05.861
Where's my buddy Jesus?

49:06.027 --> 49:07.362
We fed him to the wolves.

49:08.822 --> 49:09.823
What, literally?

49:10.991 --> 49:13.535
I am the new Jesus, <i>cabrón.</i>

49:15.537 --> 49:16.955
It's good to see you.

49:17.038 --> 49:18.206
You, too.

49:20.500 --> 49:21.501
What do you think?

49:22.878 --> 49:24.463
It's all mine, motherfucker.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.340
All those assholes
who thought I was shit?

49:27.424 --> 49:28.717
They're dead <i>por culeros.</i>

49:32.220 --> 49:34.389
We're taking down a truck.

49:34.723 --> 49:36.892
It's a big one.
An armored truck.

49:37.309 --> 49:38.477
Do you want to
join us? Huh?

49:38.560 --> 49:39.811
Are you serious?

49:44.816 --> 49:46.067
Andy?

49:47.569 --> 49:48.904
Andy!

49:50.822 --> 49:52.282
Oh, fuck.

49:52.699 --> 49:53.909
Andy!

50:14.304 --> 50:15.514
He charges...

50:15.597 --> 50:18.099
Michael, not in the house.
We're guests.

50:19.935 --> 50:21.269
Look at young Daddy.

50:21.436 --> 50:22.771
He shoots!

50:22.938 --> 50:24.272
He scores!

50:30.403 --> 50:31.655
Go find your mom.

50:37.077 --> 50:39.371
You ain't fucking around, huh? Looks
like you're ready for anything.

50:39.454 --> 50:41.414
Are you going to
war or something?

50:41.790 --> 50:45.335
I told you. We're taking down a truck.
Fucking rock and roll.

50:45.961 --> 50:47.546
No shit.
You got all these guys.

50:47.629 --> 50:49.047
What the fuck is
in that truck, man?

50:49.130 --> 50:50.131
You want to know?

50:50.215 --> 50:52.342
Then maybe you should show
these assholes how it's done.

50:52.425 --> 50:53.385
No, look...

50:53.468 --> 50:55.178
I'll give you
the super notes for free.

50:55.262 --> 50:57.973
Yeah, thanks anyway. But I
got a boat to catch, so...

50:58.139 --> 51:00.475
Come on. Don't tell me
you don't miss this shit.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.687
I got two kids now, man, you know?
My cowboy days are over.

51:03.979 --> 51:05.272
Come on, Danny!

51:08.483 --> 51:09.776
The money's gone.

51:10.277 --> 51:11.903
And Andy.

51:11.987 --> 51:12.988
What?

51:13.154 --> 51:15.031
What the fuck
are you talking about?

51:30.463 --> 51:32.507
You come in here and treat
me like an asshole?

51:33.091 --> 51:35.427
No, primo,
I wouldn't do that, man.

51:42.642 --> 51:45.270
I should fucking
blow your brains out.

51:53.653 --> 51:55.530
Does that offer still stand?

51:55.614 --> 51:59.200
We ride with you, I get
the super notes for free?

52:05.790 --> 52:09.044
Yeah, there's something
you can do for us.

52:09.794 --> 52:11.671
Grab their wallets.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.131
Give him your wallet.

52:13.214 --> 52:14.799
Give me their IDs.

52:18.595 --> 52:21.431
We're being fined every minute
longer we sit here, Captain.

52:21.514 --> 52:22.641
Yep.

52:22.724 --> 52:23.975
We got to take that...

52:27.604 --> 52:28.813
- Captain.
<i>- What's the status?</i>

52:28.897 --> 52:31.483
Pitch propeller overheated. It needs oil.
We're working on it.

52:31.608 --> 52:32.942
You got 10 minutes!

52:43.411 --> 52:44.454
It's Olaf.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.164
Chris, you have got 10 minutes.

52:46.706 --> 52:48.166
That's not long enough.

52:48.249 --> 52:49.709
<i>Have Tarik delay the loading.</i>

52:49.793 --> 52:51.711
Just stall them for as
long as you can, okay?

52:51.795 --> 52:53.838
<i>Get here.
I'll do what I can.</i>

52:58.843 --> 53:02.597
See, Chris? This is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

53:03.139 --> 53:04.391
Exactly.

53:05.767 --> 53:07.644
I mean, what are we
supposed to be doing here?

53:07.727 --> 53:09.187
Blocking the truck.

53:09.521 --> 53:11.564
Right. That's awesome.

53:11.648 --> 53:14.025
We're blocking the truck.

53:14.317 --> 53:16.361
Like human speed bumps.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.156
Tell my wife that...

53:20.240 --> 53:21.950
Will you shut the fuck up?

53:22.283 --> 53:24.953
Look, we're going to
get through this, okay?

53:25.036 --> 53:27.038
I'm not telling your wife shit!

53:35.505 --> 53:37.799
<i>Okay, ready.
They're coming.</i>

53:45.890 --> 53:46.975
Put your seatbelt on.

53:47.642 --> 53:49.477
He's coming down.
Here we go.

53:54.482 --> 53:55.483
Fuck.

54:08.037 --> 54:09.080
Is he going to slow down?

54:09.164 --> 54:10.371
Yeah, he's going to slow down.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.000
You said he's going to slow down!
He's gonna slow down.

54:12.083 --> 54:13.084
He's not slowing down!

54:13.168 --> 54:14.627
Shit!

54:19.257 --> 54:20.508
Fuck!

54:23.636 --> 54:24.679
Are you all right?

54:43.698 --> 54:45.366
Oh, my God.

54:56.461 --> 54:57.462
Oh, fuck!

55:00.298 --> 55:01.299
Get down!

55:11.059 --> 55:12.310
Danny, are you okay?

55:29.619 --> 55:32.831
I need you to hold containers
D, E and F, until I say so.

55:32.914 --> 55:34.332
I'm going to pay you $100,yeah?

55:47.470 --> 55:48.680
Fuck!

55:50.807 --> 55:52.100
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

56:14.831 --> 56:15.832
Fuck!

56:21.796 --> 56:22.964
Get down, Chris!

56:23.047 --> 56:24.048
Fuck!

56:37.687 --> 56:38.688
Hold on.

56:38.813 --> 56:40.148
What the fuck
are we doing, dude?

56:40.231 --> 56:41.274
Wait, wait, wait!

56:51.492 --> 56:52.660
Come on!

56:55.705 --> 56:56.915
Shit!

57:14.682 --> 57:16.601
Shit! Danny,
come on, we're going!

57:17.352 --> 57:18.895
Come on, Danny,
let's go! Shit!

57:33.242 --> 57:34.535
Fuck!

57:40.416 --> 57:41.417
What now?

57:50.843 --> 57:51.844
Fuck!

58:13.866 --> 58:15.576
Andy, where's Chris?

58:15.827 --> 58:16.953
Andy!

58:31.092 --> 58:33.344
Come on, we got to move!

58:38.808 --> 58:39.892
What are you doing?

58:49.527 --> 58:51.195
We got to get our IDs.

58:51.362 --> 58:52.697
- Hospital.
- Oh, shit!

58:53.656 --> 58:55.616
Take me to
the fucking hospital.

58:55.825 --> 58:58.036
Oh, shit. Danny, help.

58:58.202 --> 58:59.662
Come on, lay down.

59:02.290 --> 59:03.416
Hold him, hold him!

59:28.775 --> 59:31.027
Oh, shit!
Is he dead?

59:31.110 --> 59:32.111
He's dead!

59:32.195 --> 59:34.072
If he's fucking dead,
throw him out the van.

59:34.155 --> 59:36.115
Wait, wait!
Get our IDs!

59:36.741 --> 59:37.825
You got them?
Yeah.

59:37.909 --> 59:39.410
Toss him out!

59:43.372 --> 59:45.583
Okay, boys, let's warm her up.

59:57.804 --> 59:59.097
How much time
do you think we have?

59:59.597 --> 01:00:00.848
No time.

01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:07.230
<i>Get those containers
aboard or we 're leaving without them.</i>

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.565
<i>Chris, where the fuck are you, man?
The ship's leaving.</i>

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.817
Just hold the ship,
we're coming.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.984
<i>Just get your ass over here!</i>

01:00:12.068 --> 01:00:13.236
All right.

01:00:14.654 --> 01:00:16.155
Any crew member
hasn't come aboard yet,

01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:17.281
you make sure they get searched

01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:18.407
before you let them on,
you got me?

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:22.036
All right, come on,
it's going to open up.

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:24.330
Are we going to make it?

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.873
Yeah, he's holding
the container for us.

01:00:25.957 --> 01:00:28.126
Come on. Go, go, go!

01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.845
I'm coming.
Open the container.

01:00:38.928 --> 01:00:41.722
When you come to let us out, bring
something to clean up a bit of a mess.

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:43.558
<i>Don't forget the seals!</i>
Okay.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:44.851
Shit.

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.313
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.901
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:58.739
Come on, get your ass in here!

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:00.908
Fuck!
Fuck!

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:01.993
Shit!

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:09.584
Wait, stop!

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:10.960
Come on!

01:01:13.254 --> 01:01:14.589
The fucking doors are open!

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:15.673
Oh, fuck!

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:20.761
I got it.

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:29.979
Oh, fuck!

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:45.286
Hold up.
What's the rush?

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:46.412
Come on.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.664
I just left some food on, you know?
Come on, Jack.

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:51.125
Captain has got us searching
everybody that got off.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.645
Hey, where are you going?

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:12.396
I just stowed some decent beef.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.689
Ooh! Thank God.

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:15.858
That shit you made last
night was like chewing ass.

01:02:15.942 --> 01:02:16.943
Yeah, you would know.

01:02:17.026 --> 01:02:18.319
Fuck you, Tarik.

01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:20.446
Come on.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:21.864
You got the cleaning stuff?
Yeah.

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:23.115
You got the seals?
Yeah.

01:02:23.199 --> 01:02:26.077
All right, we got on late. They're
definitely going to check this.

01:02:27.328 --> 01:02:28.454
Holy shit!

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:29.914
Let's go, baby.

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:36.671
Will do.

01:02:37.505 --> 01:02:39.423
Customs and Border
Protection, Captain.

01:02:39.507 --> 01:02:43.052
They want us to take a look at some
containers that were loaded late.

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:45.179
All right, let's go.

01:02:45.263 --> 01:02:46.264
Call in the Second.

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:12.290
Let's go, Danny.
Let's go.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:13.457
Where are we looking, Chief?

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:15.918
The container
right up here, Captain.

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:23.801
812504.

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:25.720
812...

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:27.221
Sorry, Captain.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:35.229
Next.

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:37.898
Oh, shit.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.527
I'm gonna check the heating coils...
Wait, wait!

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:42.862
...I'm gonna need
a couple of minutes.

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:44.071
Come on, let's go.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.908
2727.

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:50.244
812729.

01:03:54.081 --> 01:03:55.166
Oh! Shit, rats!

01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:56.334
Shut it!

01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:58.627
Watch your hand.

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:02.757
Yo, yo, yo!

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.509
We got a sewage leak.
Call Brody, all right?

01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:10.097
All right, let's go.

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.612
We got two
more containers up here.

01:04:36.165 --> 01:04:39.418
Nathan-812552,

01:04:39.502 --> 01:04:41.962
812553.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.798
That's it, open it.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:05.027
525524.

01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:08.572
That's the last container
that was boarded.

01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:10.866
Go on.

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:19.667
Anything?

01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:22.920
No, sir. Smells like
it was just cleaned.

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:25.005
All right, seal it up.

01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:27.842
Customs will take it apart
when we get back home.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:45.651
I need to tell you...

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:47.695
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.405
Are you fucking crazy?

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.323
Where's the money?
Where is it?

01:05:51.407 --> 01:05:52.825
It's gone!
I had to use it.

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.702
It's what?
Where's the money?

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:56.203
What are you trying to...

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.496
What did you just say to me?

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.622
I had to use it.

01:05:58.706 --> 01:05:59.665
You what?

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:01.750
I had to use it.

01:06:02.418 --> 01:06:04.044
It's in the ceiling.

01:06:05.254 --> 01:06:07.089
No, you fucking...

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.805
How fucking stupid are you?

01:06:14.889 --> 01:06:17.766
I came out here to help you,
to risk my fucking freedom

01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:20.853
and my wife
and my children for this?

01:06:20.936 --> 01:06:22.771
Motherfucker.

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:26.567
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with all that?

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.068
You got to be the dumbest
motherfucker...

01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:30.112
He said he was
going to kill Michael.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:32.364
What?

01:06:32.448 --> 01:06:34.325
<i>You have one saved message.</i>

01:06:34.408 --> 01:06:37.161
<i>Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching
your sister's kid play soccer.</i>

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:38.370
<i>You don't call me back,</i>

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:40.831
<i>I'm gonna walk out on that field
and put a bullet in his head.</i>

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.425
Get the bag.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.386
Are you all right?
Yeah.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:55.471
You all right?
You all right?

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:56.597
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.933
I'm sorry.
Calm down, calm down.

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.285
- Chris.
- Hey.

01:07:18.369 --> 01:07:19.578
Everything okay?
Boys all right?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.455
Yeah, they're sleeping.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:24.083
What's up? Is everything okay?
Is Andy okay?

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:27.294
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Is Sebastian there?

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:30.422
Yeah, he is. Do you
want me to get him for you?

01:07:30.506 --> 01:07:31.799
<i>No, no.</i>

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.134
No, it's okay.
Go back to sleep.

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:35.427
<i>I'll call you in the morning.</i>

01:07:35.511 --> 01:07:37.304
Okay. I love you.

01:07:37.388 --> 01:07:39.223
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:07:58.492 --> 01:07:59.493
<i>Chris?</i>

01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:02.121
Chris, I've been trying to call you.
What's going on?

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:03.414
Andy picked something up.

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:05.583
Really? I thought
we weren't doing that.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.625
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:09.461
Thank God for Andy taking
the initiative, though, huh?

01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:10.963
Too bad I'm not bringing it in.

01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:13.757
I'm thinking of dumping
it in the sea, actually.

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:15.759
Why would you do that?

01:08:15.843 --> 01:08:17.886
Then we would all be fucked!

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.555
Take it on faith.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:29.064
I need to talk to you.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:41.702
Is something wrong?

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.624
I told you I would
call you with an update.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:49.376
You've got a few more days left

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:52.880
before I cut your head off
and stick it up your ass.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.549
And you're asking me,
"Is there anything wrong?"

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.054
Well, I got
something coming in.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.600
You don't sound so sure.

01:09:05.684 --> 01:09:07.227
I'm sure.
It's coming in.

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:10.272
Flying solo ain't
for sidekicks, Abney.

01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:14.734
I fucking warned you.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.863
When you first
came to me for help

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.948
in keeping your
little business afloat,

01:09:20.032 --> 01:09:22.326
I fucking warned you.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.537
I said, "You've got to
know your limitations."

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.457
"Don't live beyond
your fucking means!"

01:09:31.794 --> 01:09:33.921
I don't normally
do this fucking shit.

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.508
Telling you what's going to
happen when you don't pay.

01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:40.469
What's the fucking point?
You know the rules, right?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.763
Right.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.273
You take care, Abney.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.326
Jack, neat

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:55.502
Somebody's off the wagon.

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:04.136
I want you to go see Kate.

01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:07.014
Man, I thought
she was your family.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.267
You know, if you want to fuck
his wife, you fuck his wife.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.603
But don't waste my time
so you can play hero.

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:14.438
Chris is falling apart
out there.

01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:16.273
He's going to dump the package.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.151
Don't touch her.
Just get her attention.

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:23.155
All right.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.166
Yeah.

01:11:54.937 --> 01:11:56.188
Oh, man.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:58.774
Do you think
it's going to work?

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:00.734
It's going to work.
You think so?

01:12:00.901 --> 01:12:02.444
Did you take science
in school, Tarik?

01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:03.612
Yeah.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.448
Then you should know salt
dissolves in water, bitch.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:08.617
Are you leaving soon?

01:12:08.826 --> 01:12:10.536
Yeah, Sebastian is
dropping the boys off.

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:11.954
We're going home.

01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:14.748
Oh, that's right.
Chris is coming home.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.041
Yeah.

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:17.626
So, you'll be all
smiles in the morning?

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:19.211
I hope so.

01:12:20.212 --> 01:12:21.755
You get out of here, I got it.

01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:23.131
Good night.

01:12:25.092 --> 01:12:26.802
Good night.
Good night, baby.

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:27.970
I'll lock the door.

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.096
Thanks.

01:13:03.714 --> 01:13:04.882
Oh, my God!

01:13:06.884 --> 01:13:08.635
Get the fuck away from me!

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:10.637
My friend will be here,
he'll kick your...

01:13:14.683 --> 01:13:17.477
I'm going to be
perfectly fucking clear.

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:21.440
You call your husband and you tell
him not to dump it in the water!

01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:26.153
You tell him that you, Michael and
Eddie are all depending on him.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.322
Do you understand me?

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.662
Do you understand me?

01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:39.333
Stay away from my kids!

01:13:41.919 --> 01:13:43.003
He's got a gun!

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.589
Whoa! What
are you doing?

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:03.315
Hey.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:11.907
Are you all right?

01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:15.118
Honey, I want you to get
in the truck with me.

01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:16.995
The kids are inside, all right?

01:14:17.079 --> 01:14:18.830
You smell like alcohol.

01:14:19.915 --> 01:14:21.333
Yeah, I had a drink.

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:23.877
You're driving my kids around drunk?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:25.170
Relax. What did
he say to you?

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:32.094
Come on, get out. We're going in my car.
Let's go.

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:34.513
Kate! Guys,
get back in the car.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.890
Kate, what are you doing?

01:14:38.058 --> 01:14:41.520
Kate! Kate!
Get in the truck.

01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:43.355
Fuck.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:45.315
<i>He knew the kids' names.</i>

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.151
Hold on, you're breaking up, okay?
Let me go outside.

01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:49.528
Oh, fuck.

01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:52.948
Cell service sucks here on the river.
Hold on, I'm going outside.

01:14:54.241 --> 01:14:56.284
Hello? He told me
to tell you...

01:14:56.368 --> 01:14:58.120
No, hold on.
I can't hear you.

01:14:58.203 --> 01:14:59.830
<i>He told me to tell you
not to dump it in...</i>

01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:01.289
<i>He told me to tell
you not to dump it.</i>

01:15:01.415 --> 01:15:02.374
Who did?

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:04.251
Who? The asshole
who came to the house!

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:05.585
Who the fuck told him?

01:15:05.711 --> 01:15:06.670
<i>What?</i>

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.296
Are the boys okay?

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:09.881
They're here.
We're at Jeanie's.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:11.758
<i>Kate? Hello?</i>

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:14.594
Chris, please come home.

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:17.556
Chris?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.850
Chris?

01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:24.271
Hey, how did it go?

01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:26.189
We boarded up the front window.

01:15:26.273 --> 01:15:29.192
The cops took a report.
They're looking for the guy.

01:15:29.276 --> 01:15:30.318
All right.

01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:31.445
They want to talk to you.

01:15:33.447 --> 01:15:36.408
Yeah. I'm going to
go by in the morning.

01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.493
They want to talk to you now.

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:42.831
But we have no stuff. I've got to
go to Sebastian's to get our stuff.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.791
Would you mind watching
the boys for a second?

01:15:44.875 --> 01:15:46.209
Look at your forehead.

01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:48.211
Are you sure you don't need me
to take you to the hospital?

01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:51.631
No, it's just...
It looks worse than it is.

01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:54.968
It just hurts.
Like a bruise, you know?

01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:59.431
I think I should go now before I can't.
You know what I mean?

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:01.016
I'll see you in a little bit.

01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:02.559
Goodbye, Mom.
I love you.

01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:03.643
Be good boys.

01:16:25.165 --> 01:16:26.166
Sebastian?

01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:38.637
Did you tell Briggs
I was going to dump it?

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.181
No. I didn't
tell nobody.

01:16:41.348 --> 01:16:42.349
Don't lie to me.

01:16:42.474 --> 01:16:44.893
Chris, I'm not fucking lying to you.
I didn't say shit.

01:16:46.478 --> 01:16:48.355
Where did you get the drugs?

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.690
From a guy called Ruben.

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:56.196
Sebastian?

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.195
Hey.

01:17:37.362 --> 01:17:39.406
Hi. I'm just
getting our stuff.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:41.867
Are you hungry?
Let me make you some food.

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:43.076
No, I can't.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.662
The boat's not coming in. I
got to get back to the boys.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:46.830
Chris will be back tonight.

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:48.582
No, he's not. He's not
coming home tonight.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:51.126
I mean, the boat's not coming in
for, like, I don't know, tomorrow.

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:53.086
Chris told me that
I had to take care of you,

01:17:53.170 --> 01:17:54.171
so I'm going to
take care of you.

01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:56.089
Sebastian, are you not hearing me?
We'll be fine, okay?

01:17:56.173 --> 01:17:57.174
Yeah, we're fine.

01:17:57.257 --> 01:17:58.341
Okay, good.
All right. Good.

01:17:58.425 --> 01:17:59.593
Give me a hug.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.098
Okay.
Okay.

01:18:05.265 --> 01:18:06.349
It's been such a big day.

01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:07.475
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:09.352
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:12.856
I'm trying to give my friend a fucking kiss.
What's your problem?

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.524
What's your problem?
Kate, come on.

01:18:14.608 --> 01:18:17.360
Look, I mean,
did you even see this?

01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:18.445
Stop it.

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:19.571
Kate.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.949
How long have we
known each other?

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:25.619
You know what?
Get your hands off me!

01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:28.079
Kate? Kate!

01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:29.789
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:18:30.624 --> 01:18:31.708
Kate!

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:33.710
Kate!

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:35.795
Jesus Christ. Kate!

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:38.089
I'm trying to have
a conversation with you,

01:18:38.173 --> 01:18:39.799
and you're acting
like a fucking child.

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:41.760
Okay. Good. Why don't you
just walk away from the door,

01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:42.844
and let me get out of here.

01:18:42.928 --> 01:18:46.223
An ungrateful child. A little fucking
brat, who's not grateful for...

01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:48.892
Do you want to talk to Chris
about what a fucking bitch I am?

01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:50.810
I'm going to fucking call
him on the phone right now!

01:18:50.894 --> 01:18:52.312
Don't call Chris.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.482
Sweetheart, I love you,
but open the door.

01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:56.566
I'm calling Chris!

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:57.651
Don't mess with his head now!

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:58.985
Why don't you fucking tell him?

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.030
Shit!

01:19:02.113 --> 01:19:04.282
Honey, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:05.742
Kate?

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.453
Kate, it's not funny.
Stop fucking around.

01:19:09.955 --> 01:19:11.164
Fuck.

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:19.673
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

01:19:21.508 --> 01:19:22.759
Shit.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.513
Kate?

01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:28.014
Kate! Kate!

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:56.710
Hey.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.503
I know what you did.

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.213
I know Briggs works for you.

01:20:00.297 --> 01:20:02.716
You stay the fuck away from my
family, or I'm going to kill you.

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.134
You hear me?

01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:06.970
Just bring in the package
. Everything's going to be fine.

01:20:09.431 --> 01:20:10.807
I'm not bringing in shit.

01:20:11.391 --> 01:20:13.435
<i>You'll never see
that fucking package.</i>

01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:14.769
You know,
I didn't know about...

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.397
<i>I can't believe you.
You fucking played me.</i>

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.815
I'm not playing you.

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:21.901
I'm coming.
I'm coming for you.

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.070
Okay.

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:32.454
Captain Camp.

01:20:32.537 --> 01:20:33.496
Sebastian.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.332
<i>What do you want, Abney?</i>

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:37.751
Chris Farraday is running shit.

01:20:39.586 --> 01:20:40.754
Okay.

01:20:41.379 --> 01:20:42.505
He's going to dump the package.

01:20:42.589 --> 01:20:44.966
If you make sure he doesn't,
I will give you his share.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.347
Jesus, Abney.
You are one cold rat bastard.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.100
All right.

01:20:54.184 --> 01:20:55.310
But if Farraday
don't give it up,

01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:57.520
I'm going to call in the dogs, and
your package is getting seized.

01:20:57.604 --> 01:21:01.107
No, he'll tell you where it is.
He won't risk doing time.

01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:02.525
<i>Next time you want
to run shit on my ship,</i>

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:04.778
you do it right and pay a
fare like everybody else.

01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:23.755
Where is it?
Where's what?

01:21:24.756 --> 01:21:26.841
You're running something. I
know you're running something.

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:28.510
I'm not running
anything, Captain.

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:30.136
You want to play that way?
Check.

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.388
This is your one chance.

01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:33.640
You give it up now,
or you want me to call CBP?

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:34.808
I'm not running anything.

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.684
Your wife asked me to bring
some Panamanian dog shit home

01:21:36.768 --> 01:21:38.186
for her to eat and rub
in her fucking cunt...

01:21:38.269 --> 01:21:39.729
Fuck you, you piece of shit.
But I didn't have time.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:41.564
You dumb-ass motherfucker!
This is how you want it?

01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:42.732
Yeah, this is how I want it.

01:21:42.816 --> 01:21:44.401
You want to go down just
like your dumb-ass daddy,

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:45.985
you piece of shit mick?

01:21:46.069 --> 01:21:47.070
Fuck this.

01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:48.238
You made it now, motherfucker.

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:49.322
Right?

01:21:49.989 --> 01:21:53.159
Whatever it is,
CBP is going to find it.

01:21:57.872 --> 01:21:59.165
Yeah, he's in the cafeteria.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:00.792
<i>You're clear.</i>

01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:35.827
Come on, come on.

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.997
Shit!
Pick up the phone, buddy.

01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:05.190
Customs and Border Protection,
Port of New Orleans.

01:23:06.816 --> 01:23:08.568
It's Redmond, line two.

01:23:11.237 --> 01:23:12.322
Redmond.

01:23:12.405 --> 01:23:14.741
Yeah, John,
I've got a good tip.

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:16.618
Somebody's making
a run on my ship.

01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:17.744
<i>Really?</i>

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:19.120
All right, listen up,
guys and gals,

01:23:19.204 --> 01:23:22.916
<i>I want an interdiction team ready
for deployment in 20 minutes.</i>

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.083
Let's go.

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:33.801
<i>Flight 104, copy that.
Three minutes to contact.</i>

01:24:13.299 --> 01:24:14.509
<i>Ready. Standing by.</i>

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:21.432
Holy shit!

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:25.478
Well, it was good
while it lasted.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.030
Who the fuck
called the cavalry in?

01:24:44.789 --> 01:24:46.124
Inspection, please!

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:48.835
All crew. Everybody.

01:24:50.003 --> 01:24:51.045
Who's in here?

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.053
Welcome aboard.

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:48.936
All right, gentlemen, sit down.

01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:50.730
What the fuck is going on?

01:26:01.908 --> 01:26:03.743
Larry, check the ceiling.

01:26:09.415 --> 01:26:10.583
Take it down.

01:26:12.085 --> 01:26:13.920
Wow! Look at this.

01:26:18.091 --> 01:26:19.092
There's nothing in there.

01:26:19.175 --> 01:26:20.218
There's nothing in there?

01:26:21.052 --> 01:26:22.178
Shit!

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:25.515
That's enough.

01:26:29.686 --> 01:26:30.687
A tarp.

01:26:32.772 --> 01:26:34.148
Tool box with nothing in it.

01:26:35.942 --> 01:26:37.360
You said you thought
it smelled funny, right?

01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:38.403
Yes, Captain.

01:26:38.486 --> 01:26:41.489
Maybe it's just been cleaned.
That's about it.

01:26:41.781 --> 01:26:43.616
Could be covering up
something, maybe?

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.784
Could be.

01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:58.548
Watch your step.

01:26:58.715 --> 01:27:00.758
Just put the carpet
cleaner in the trunk.

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:05.972
You got it?

01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:08.099
Just put it right there,
that's fine.

01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:53.227
Fuck.

01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:55.563
Oh, shit.

01:28:01.402 --> 01:28:02.695
The van in D-7.

01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:04.030
What about it?

01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:05.948
We're taking it apart now.

01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:10.203
But you can just save us the
trouble, and tell us what's in it.

01:28:10.328 --> 01:28:11.329
I would love to help you,

01:28:11.412 --> 01:28:12.747
but I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:15.082
Do you think we're stupid?

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:20.838
And who is Jib Lakowski?

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:24.550
It says right there, he's
the guy shipping the van,

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:26.344
so maybe you
should talk to him.

01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:28.262
He died in 2004.

01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:31.390
Then I guess he's not
going to need the van. Huh?

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:18.604
What's up, Houdini?

01:29:18.688 --> 01:29:20.940
You got something for me?

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.441
What are you talking about?

01:29:22.817 --> 01:29:25.987
Come on, man.
Just give it to him.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:27.196
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.364
Come on, man!

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:31.117
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Say goodbye to Andy.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.660
- Chris! Chris!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:34.704
Don't fuck me, man!

01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:35.997
What are you doing?

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:43.754
Chris!

01:29:43.838 --> 01:29:45.339
Run, Andy!

01:29:49.969 --> 01:29:51.178
Fuck, Briggs.

01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:56.142
Pull the fucking trigger!

01:29:56.309 --> 01:29:57.894
You don't get
your dope if I'm dead.

01:30:23.044 --> 01:30:24.045
Here.

01:30:25.004 --> 01:30:26.172
This is it right here.

01:30:27.673 --> 01:30:29.008
Right here?

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:30.259
Yeah.

01:30:30.343 --> 01:30:33.137
What, you got your
grandma selling cocaine?

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.014
It's my friend's place.

01:30:44.857 --> 01:30:46.651
You better not
be messing around,

01:30:46.734 --> 01:30:48.527
I'll put a bullet in your face.

01:30:49.904 --> 01:30:51.948
All right,
take it easy. Come on.

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:55.618
- Is your friend home?
- Quiet.

01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:57.870
Trust me, you don't want
to wake this fucker up.

01:30:57.954 --> 01:30:59.455
<i>One,
state your position, please.</i>

01:30:59.538 --> 01:31:00.915
211, responding.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:04.877
<i>We have a home security alarm
triggered at 452 King Drive.</i>

01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:13.135
Hey, you got
some rich friends, man.

01:31:15.888 --> 01:31:16.889
Come on.

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:20.726
Shut that door.

01:31:49.505 --> 01:31:52.675
Whoo! That's some world-class
smuggling right there, man.

01:31:53.592 --> 01:31:54.760
Yeah!

01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.599
We got it now, man.

01:32:01.017 --> 01:32:02.018
Check this out.

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:05.855
This is the shit, man.

01:32:06.689 --> 01:32:07.940
Check this out.

01:32:08.107 --> 01:32:09.150
Yeah.

01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:15.823
Oh, that's some real
booger-sugar right there.

01:32:15.948 --> 01:32:16.949
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

01:32:17.658 --> 01:32:18.659
It's good?

01:32:18.784 --> 01:32:19.744
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:19.827 --> 01:32:21.203
Great. I'm going
to take a piss,

01:32:21.287 --> 01:32:22.621
I've been holding it
since I got off the boat.

01:32:22.705 --> 01:32:24.498
All right, you do that.

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.472
It doesn't want
to come out, man.

01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.348
They make it stubborn...

01:32:41.474 --> 01:32:42.808
Who the hell are you?

01:32:42.892 --> 01:32:45.311
What the fuck are you doing
in my goddamn house?

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.897
Go back to bed, old man.

01:32:49.982 --> 01:32:50.983
Shit, it's Five-O!

01:32:51.067 --> 01:32:53.360
Get the fuck out!
Pack that shit up, man.

01:32:57.907 --> 01:32:59.075
Dumbshit.

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:02.745
Jeanie, is Kate there? She's
not picking up her phone.

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:04.080
Are the boys with you?

01:33:04.163 --> 01:33:06.499
Yeah, the boys are here.
She left a while ago.

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:08.292
Said she was going to
Sebastian's to get their stuff.

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:11.087
Listen, if she calls you, tell
her to call me right away.

01:33:14.215 --> 01:33:16.592
Absolutely fucking ridiculous.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.719
I've never seen these
idiots before in my life.

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:22.181
That one dumbshit right there
is bleeding all over my couch,

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:23.557
and they're
cutting up their drugs.

01:33:41.367 --> 01:33:42.368
Kate?

01:33:45.412 --> 01:33:46.413
Kate!

01:34:47.683 --> 01:34:48.684
Sebastian!

01:35:51.372 --> 01:35:54.083
I want you guys to pour the
cement on the south corner first.

01:35:54.166 --> 01:35:55.793
Can we start on
the south corner first?

01:35:56.835 --> 01:35:59.505
<i>We're set up for
the other side. No, we can't.</i>

01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:01.632
South corner first,
hurry the hell up.

01:36:01.715 --> 01:36:04.301
You guys have milked
this fucking job long enough!

01:36:09.556 --> 01:36:10.557
Hold it!

01:36:10.683 --> 01:36:14.061
We're pouring over on the south corner.
Take it over there.

01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:28.200
What the hell's going on here? I
thought we were doing the other side.

01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:35.791
Why are you moving
the cement truck?

01:36:36.417 --> 01:36:38.544
You're blocking
the fucking trucks.

01:36:46.885 --> 01:36:48.262
You send guys to my house?

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:51.682
Huh? I trusted you with
my wife and my kids.

01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:54.852
And I fucking loved you
like a brother.

01:36:55.019 --> 01:36:56.520
Where is Kate?

01:36:58.772 --> 01:37:01.900
Where the fuck is Kate?

01:37:02.026 --> 01:37:05.904
One more fucking time.
Where's Kate?

01:37:06.572 --> 01:37:07.573
She's gone.

01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:11.910
Are you okay, Seb?

01:37:47.946 --> 01:37:49.406
Whose phone is this?

01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:51.617
Who left their phone here?

01:38:00.959 --> 01:38:03.295
Turn that fucking
thing off, now!

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:12.137
Chris?

01:38:20.646 --> 01:38:21.647
Oh, my God!

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:23.732
Turn that fucking thing off!

01:38:37.788 --> 01:38:38.997
Call an ambulance!

01:38:39.665 --> 01:38:41.291
Oh, fuck.

01:38:41.917 --> 01:38:43.335
Call an ambulance!

01:38:43.419 --> 01:38:45.546
Call a fucking ambulance, now!

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:47.297
Yeah, I need an ambulance...

01:38:47.464 --> 01:38:48.590
Oh, shit.

01:38:48.674 --> 01:38:51.135
...at West Bank Trucking Company.
Yeah, right away.

01:39:26.044 --> 01:39:28.005
Are you sure this
is the right place?

01:39:28.547 --> 01:39:29.631
Yeah.

01:39:29.715 --> 01:39:31.800
These are the coordinates Chris
gave me when he dropped it.

01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:33.802
We're definitely
in the right place.

01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:47.649
Chris.

01:39:54.239 --> 01:39:57.534
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:40:23.268 --> 01:40:24.269
I got that.
And you got one.

01:40:24.353 --> 01:40:26.980
You cheated.
It's mine.

01:40:33.278 --> 01:40:34.279
Oh!

01:40:35.113 --> 01:40:36.114
Yeah!

01:40:39.243 --> 01:40:41.161
Oh, man!
I can't believe it.

01:40:41.245 --> 01:40:42.329
A sea full of money!

01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:43.455
We got to get in.

01:40:43.789 --> 01:40:45.082
Get it in here.
Yeah.

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:48.961
Pull it in. Be careful,
it's slippery right there.

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:50.128
Whoa!

01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:54.132
Are you all right?

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:56.093
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:41:20.701 --> 01:41:21.702
Bud?

01:41:27.249 --> 01:41:28.917
And I have sold it.

01:41:29.001 --> 01:41:31.795
4,500, number 106.
Next one.

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:34.214
Call lot number 122.
Come bid 300.

01:41:34.298 --> 01:41:36.341
A high of 300,
I have to get 400.

01:41:36.425 --> 01:41:38.969
Got 400, got a $500 bid.
Five-and-a-half?

01:41:39.052 --> 01:41:40.804
Five to six-and-a-half.

01:41:40.887 --> 01:41:43.348
I'm going to seven,
going to seven-and-a-half.

01:41:43.432 --> 01:41:44.975
Can I have an $800 bid?
Get an 800?

01:41:45.058 --> 01:41:47.561
And I have sold it.

01:41:47.644 --> 01:41:51.481
Seven-and-a-half to number 77.
Thank you, sir. Next one.

01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:14.004
I'll take it off
your hands for 2.5.

01:42:15.505 --> 01:42:17.466
I'm not taking
any less than three.

01:42:21.845 --> 01:42:22.929
Okay, three.

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:25.891
Come on.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.358
So you were down
in Panama, were you?

01:42:35.525 --> 01:42:36.652
Yeah.

01:42:37.486 --> 01:42:41.239
Did you hear about that famous
painting by Jackson Pollock?

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.911
It got ripped off in Panama.

01:42:47.621 --> 01:42:50.248
Come on, it's been
all over the news.

01:42:51.458 --> 01:42:53.710
No. No idea.

01:42:55.170 --> 01:42:56.672
What's that thing
worth, anyway?

01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:58.840
About 140 million.

01:42:59.883 --> 01:43:02.427
What's that,
20 on the black market?

01:43:03.303 --> 01:43:04.638
At least.

01:43:06.056 --> 01:43:08.392
I'm in the wrong business, huh?

01:43:25.951 --> 01:43:27.452
Get in, get in.

01:43:27.619 --> 01:43:28.912
Hurry up!

01:43:30.038 --> 01:43:31.039
Whoo!

01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:35.419
Wow. Whoo!

01:43:35.544 --> 01:43:36.670
Twenty.

01:43:37.754 --> 01:43:39.715
Twenty! It's twenty!

01:43:42.342 --> 01:43:43.385
Twenty million.

01:43:45.804 --> 01:43:46.930
Yes!
