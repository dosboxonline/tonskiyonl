how they got my hair.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.394
I bet they're the ones that killed him.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.855

15:39.856 --> 15:41.065
Why did I not hear about this?

15:41.066 --> 15:44.109
Last time we talked,
you had other priorities.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.029
But it makes sense
that they'd take him out.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.698
His bark could wake
the entire neighborhood.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.575
If Bailey's alive,
they don't get in my house.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.454
[scoffs] Yeah. Like they helped.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.706

checked out a car parked nearby.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.291
Nothing.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.044
Well, it might hit different now,
with two of us involved.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.087
You're right.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.964
It has to be a case that we did together.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.300
Do you remember that Jerry Cooper guy?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.052
The St. Patrick's day thing?

16:10.053 --> 16:12.346
He was about to get
a misdemeanor for lewd behavior

16:12.347 --> 16:15.600
until you showed up and got it up to
first-degree sexual assault.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.352
What made him jump to mind?

16:18.353 --> 16:20.229
Brecher gave him the max-- eight years--

16:20.230 --> 16:21.439
and a lifetime on the predator list.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.235
He swore he was coming after you.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.444
Do you remember what he said?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.655
"He ruined my life.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.324
I'm gonna ruin his."

16:37.330 --> 16:38.706
You got evidence that would justify

16:38.707 --> 16:39.832

16:41.167 --> 16:43.001

We're talking about Emir Goodspeed.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.921
[Sampson] Right, but they got killed

16:45.922 --> 16:47.047
to cover up what happened to him.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.549
That doesn't do it for you?

16:48.550 --> 16:49.675
Well, not when making that change

16:49.676 --> 16:51.468

16:51.469 --> 16:54.388
And there's other scenarios
more plausible than murder.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.973
Well, like what?

16:55.974 --> 16:58.475
Emir Goodspeed had a long drug history,

16:58.476 --> 17:00.352
both as a seller and a user.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.813
He overdosed on drugs
supplied by Tavio Lemmons.

17:02.814 --> 17:06.400
Oh, but then he called Tavio for help?
I mean, you heard the voicemail.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.944
- We should let De Lackner finish.
- She doesn't have anything
to do with this.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.119

17:17.120 --> 17:18.370
Emir was clean.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.956
Enough. I've seen the report.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.458
What De Lackner's saying

17:22.459 --> 17:23.876

17:23.877 --> 17:26.962
