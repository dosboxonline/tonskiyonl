01:07.719 --> 01:08.633
<i>Please.</i>

01:55.637 --> 01:57.334
Please let me,
please let me out.

01:57.726 --> 01:58.553
Please let me out.

02:00.381 --> 02:04.080
Please, please, please let
me out of here, please.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.474
Please help.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.093
Yes, Mr. Neely, Mr. Neely.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.491
Bet you didn't think you'd
end up here, did you?

02:24.666 --> 02:25.493
No.

02:26.972 --> 02:30.411
Tell me about yourself,
you're a world class hacker.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.891
Maybe a first rate...

02:32.891 --> 02:34.066
analyst.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.590
A greedy analyst. What is it?

02:35.807 --> 02:38.158
What is it? What is it
you do, Mr. Neely?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.247
Please, okay?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.640
I will cooperate with you.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.207
I, I will tell you whatever
you want.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.948
Anything you want to know.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.040
I don't give a fuck
what you know.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.998
I really don't. Means
nothing to me.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.871
It's what you're worth.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.398
Hmm. Apparently, it's allowed

03:01.398 --> 03:02.878
you've made some
powerful enemies my friend.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.186
I'm, I'm sorry.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.404
Okay?

03:07.404 --> 03:08.710
I never meant to hurt anyone.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.190
-  No.
- Okay, I just

03:10.190 --> 03:11.408
I saw the numbers,

03:11.408 --> 03:12.888
- they were off.
-  The numbers.

03:12.888 --> 03:13.976
And I just, I just.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.196
-  Were off.
-  Mhmm.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.242
You're gonna make me
a rich man, Mr. Neely.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.550
Where was he?

03:23.507 --> 03:24.856
- He was at--
- At home.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.381
You were at home?

03:28.947 --> 03:30.514
What were you doing at home
eating popcorn watching...

03:30.514 --> 03:33.169
cartoon reruns?

03:33.169 --> 03:34.083
That's really stupid.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.606
You're stupid.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.218
Stupid, Mr. Neely.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.308
A moron.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.963
Just a moron.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.488
The Collective are getting
close to finding us.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.229
They're nothing to worry
about for the moment.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.276
They only have one
operative in Boston.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.280
You sure he's the only one?

03:57.585 --> 03:59.761
Yes, I got into their
system last night.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.110
Will they send more?

04:01.328 --> 04:03.243
If they do,
I'll know about it.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.246
We still have that apartment?

04:06.550 --> 04:07.508
Yes, sir.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.472
Send them a bad tip.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.692
A set up, a meeting, a trap.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.520
I don't want to hear
about him again.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.001
Nikita, can you set that up?

04:24.176 --> 04:25.352
I'll send some guys.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.399
-  Okay, look.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.446
Send some guys.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.275
So what do I do
about this one?

04:36.145 --> 04:37.059
This one?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.104
Mr. Neely.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.890
It looks kind of cozy
in there, actually.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.413
Like a little rat.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.067
A little rat,

04:45.067 --> 04:46.547
sort of whistleblower,
isn't it?

04:46.547 --> 04:49.114
Little rat?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.640
Give the rat some cheese.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.208
-  Coming right up.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.158
Please.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.290
Please, please.

09:12.813 --> 09:13.901
Please, please don't kill me.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.556
I'll pay you way
more than they will.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.836
Nice time.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.579
The fastest I've seen.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.581
Let's check your work.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.408
Dead.

09:43.757 --> 09:44.671
Dead.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.846
Definitely dead.

09:46.063 --> 09:46.890
Dead.

09:48.022 --> 09:48.849
Maybe.

09:50.851 --> 09:51.852
How '‘bout now?

09:53.854 --> 09:54.942
And the target?

09:57.335 --> 09:58.206
Good.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.817
Very good.
That's not so great.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.604
- Yeah, it's not fatal.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.737
Fatal or not.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.391
Could distract you.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.915
Could take you out of the
game even for a second.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.264
That could be the difference.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.440
Otherwise, good job.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.747
All right.

10:18.922 --> 10:19.836
Everybody.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.447
Say hello to the newest
member of The Collective.

10:27.844 --> 10:28.715
Welcome.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.718
Sic casus praecipuus.

10:31.979 --> 10:32.980
May the privilege fall.

10:33.545 --> 10:34.546
That's not just a motto.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.548
That's code.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.638
- Don't forget it.
- I won't.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.816
So, when's
my first assignment?

10:43.425 --> 10:44.731
- Excuse me?
-  Soon, or?

10:45.122 --> 10:46.602
You know, because
I could go right now.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.908
Good. Glad to hear it.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
You start in the
office tomorrow.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.303
You still got a lot to learn
about the organization.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.023
This is it?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.460
This place looks like shit.

11:37.958 --> 11:38.872
Hi.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.178
- Hi! Name?
- Sam Alexander.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.571
Do you have an appointment?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.355
- Yes.
- With who?

11:44.573 --> 11:45.922
Dr. Casus.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.145
Can I see your confirmation?

11:51.754 --> 11:52.581
Yeah.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.809
- Huh. I, um.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.724
I don't see you in the system.

12:09.641 --> 12:10.468
I'm new.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.383
- Um.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.909
Is uh,
something wrong?

12:22.263 --> 12:23.568
Oh, hey, Sam.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.048
There you are.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.182
- He's with me.

12:28.399 --> 12:29.226
First day.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.317
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.015
Well then,
welcome to The Collective.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.668
We'll make him a file later,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.235
but go ahead
and activate his pen.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.455
Sorry I didn't
get you in the system yet.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.110
- You scared her.
- Oh, all good.

12:43.719 --> 12:44.720
You're lucky
you got your legs.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.201
Oh, while you're in here, um,

12:47.418 --> 12:48.942
make sure you wear your pin.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.422
Because the doors have sensors
and can read the microchip

12:51.422 --> 12:52.467
from inside.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.564
And here we got
the control centre.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.131
Each one of the controllers
are the eyes

13:04.131 --> 13:06.089
and ears of every agent
in the field.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
- Door on the left.
- Hold on.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.838
There are seven guys on
the other side of that door.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.361
- Proceed with caution.
- Careful.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.928
There's an alarm.
Let me just disarm it.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.148
All right.

13:22.584 --> 13:23.672
And this is where
the collective decides

13:23.672 --> 13:25.500
which contracts
to send up the chain.

13:25.717 --> 13:26.936
You'll start here.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.765
Doing paperwork?

13:30.157 --> 13:31.811
We all start somewhere, Sam.

13:32.072 --> 13:32.899
Good luck.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.225
So you're the one that
beat my time

13:55.225 --> 13:56.748
on the training course.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.750
You're a little old, no?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.147
I'm Robert.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.106
And that's Barbara.

14:06.106 --> 14:06.933
Not that you will,

14:08.369 --> 14:09.109
But if you need anything,
we'd be happy to help.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.590
I'd be happy to help.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.637
Can you tell me how long
I'll be staying in contracts?

14:16.246 --> 14:18.074
Field agents
always start here.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.902
If you're desperate
for some action,

14:20.120 --> 14:21.164
you can move to control.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.426
Sorry.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.212
Didn't just leave my desk job so
I could work another desk job.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.390
Then you'll put in the
time like the rest of us.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.913
What's your background?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.486
I worked for the DA.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.487
-  Oh.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.358
Really?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.317
So you're an attorney?

14:44.144 --> 14:45.449
I was.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.755
And then I got bored.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.323
I don't see how that
translates into wet work.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.805
You watch enough
guilty people walk free

14:53.805 --> 14:55.198
and eventually
you want to go out there

14:55.198 --> 14:56.547
and take care of them yourself.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.461
Hmm.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.159
Very proactive.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.812
Look, I get that.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.119
But don't be so anxious
to get out there.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.904
The training course
is one thing,

15:05.426 --> 15:07.080
but the real world,

15:07.080 --> 15:10.257
would eat you alive.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.086
- I'm not so sure about that.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.565
We'll see.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.350
Barb.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.843
But if we wait,

15:32.018 --> 15:34.194
We're gonna miss our
chance at getting Neely

15:34.194 --> 15:35.586
and all of his intel.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.938
Can't afford to lose you either.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.288
If we have the shot,

15:42.115 --> 15:43.464
we have to take it.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.682
Come on, Hugo.

15:44.682 --> 15:45.727
It's not Bin Laden.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.163
We're gonna get
another chance.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.077
<i>Yes, at Miro.</i>

15:48.948 --> 15:50.079
But if we wait,

15:50.079 --> 15:52.125
we'll miss our chance
at getting Neely.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.909
All right.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.391
Well, give us a day to
verify the reports,

15:57.391 --> 15:58.783
get a schematic
of the building,

15:58.783 --> 16:00.394
and I'll hook you up
with a controller.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.483
No, there's no time.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.704
Because we don't know how
soon until he auctions Neely.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.623
You know I'm right.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.712
Of course you are.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.064
It's an apartment building.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.023
<i>With two elevators,
two sets of stairs,</i>

16:21.023 --> 16:22.807
<i>and four escape routes.</i>

16:23.156 --> 16:24.766
Can't be that easy.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.898
Miro hasn't been caught
yet for a reason.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.118
Because I haven't tried yet.

16:31.773 --> 16:32.861
All right.

16:33.731 --> 16:34.819
You're too damn stubborn

16:34.819 --> 16:36.473
for this conversation
to go anywhere.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.909
So I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.607
I will let you go in there,

16:39.868 --> 16:41.000
not because I want to,

16:41.217 --> 16:42.871
because I know you're
gonna do it anyway.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.568
Anything else?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.005
Yeah.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.703
Do you want anything special
said at your funeral?

16:49.138 --> 16:51.184
You're not invited
to my funeral.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.013
Oh, I, I wasn't coming anyway.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.668
So, do we have a deal?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.288
- Hey, Sam.

17:08.940 --> 17:09.811
You got a minute?

17:22.998 --> 17:25.392
Come in, Sam. Sit down.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.048
Take a look at that file.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.658
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.143
Out loud, please.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.624
Okay.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.975
Miro Lindell.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.110
He's a notorious human
trafficking kingpin.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.939
He's in bed with
billionaires, politicians,

17:50.939 --> 17:52.549
law enforcement, you name it.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.247
Basically untouchable.

17:55.596 --> 17:56.727
So is he?

17:58.164 --> 18:00.035
Untouchable? No.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.602
Nobody's untouchable.

18:05.432 --> 18:06.563
If anything, seems a
little too easy.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.262
There's no special
security protocols

18:09.262 --> 18:10.393
outside of a detail.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.047
I mean, at most, you're
facing guards

18:12.047 --> 18:13.701
at the ground level
and at the apartment.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.703
All right,
so what would you do?

18:17.618 --> 18:19.054
Are you asking
me if I want this?

18:19.359 --> 18:20.882
I'm asking for your thoughts.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.235
I go in at night,

18:26.801 --> 18:27.932
late at night,

18:27.932 --> 18:29.456
when the least
civilians are around.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.944
<i>It's an
apartment building, so.</i>

18:42.338 --> 18:44.427
Ground level guards would
be less conspicuous.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.691
<i>Lookouts assessing
who comes and goes.</i>

19:04.186 --> 19:06.449
I'm somewhat
of a master of disguise, so.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.973
Master of disguise, huh?

19:11.019 --> 19:11.976
Somewhat.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.806
Anyway, I walk right in
without firing a shot.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.313
Okay.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.141
You're in the building now.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.142
What's next?

19:49.405 --> 19:50.232
Well,

19:51.320 --> 19:52.843
you need access
to the elevator.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.062
Lucky for us, the controller
could easily hack into it.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.657
Quick, clean, and simple.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.487
There would be guards
in the hallway.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.837
I would keep my distance and,

20:30.620 --> 20:32.448
try and take them out
before they engage.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.599
I'd be especially careful

20:52.599 --> 20:54.557
about the guards located
outside the front door.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.343
That's where I'd put
my toughest guys.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.237
It's all downhill from there.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.720
It's a good plan, on paper.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.897
What does your gut say?

21:31.942 --> 21:33.161
It's a trap.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.281
Field work is rarely simple.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.762
One has to be prepared
to improvise.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.203
That kind of training
takes time.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.684
Well, how can I learn
when I'm stuck here

23:01.684 --> 23:03.251
doing contracts?

23:06.341 --> 23:07.298
Stuck?

23:08.212 --> 23:09.518
Sam, it's your first day.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.261
You want me on this
assignment, don't you?

23:15.089 --> 23:17.308
I promise I can get it done.

23:22.749 --> 23:24.098
Go back to work.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.030
Amazing. You're alive.

24:27.248 --> 24:28.945
He wasn't there.

24:29.772 --> 24:30.599
<i>Fuck.</i>

24:31.470 --> 24:33.297
There were men waiting for me.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.953
Well, that means
they're in our system.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.477
You're compromised.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.653
How can you let this happen?

24:41.610 --> 24:43.220
<i>I would say it was Neely.</i>

24:43.220 --> 24:45.788
<i>He clearly has more
intel on us than we realized.</i>

24:46.441 --> 24:47.529
<i>We have to pull you out.</i>

24:47.747 --> 24:49.270
No, not happening.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.751
Well, it's not safe anymore.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.796
<i>We need Neely.</i>

24:53.796 --> 24:55.058
Well, if he knows about you

24:55.058 --> 24:56.582
and he knows
about all of our other agents,

24:56.582 --> 24:58.888
how are we going to get him
if he can see us coming?

25:00.411 --> 25:02.239
Then what do you suggest?

25:04.067 --> 25:05.591
It's pretty obvious to me
that we need

25:05.591 --> 25:08.158
someone
that's not in our system.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.641
Why haven't I seen you before?

33:12.077 --> 33:14.079
Liam sent me, I'm, uh, new.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.737
You, uh, gonna let
me in or what?

33:21.521 --> 33:23.044
Grab the shit.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.444
- It's a nice place.

33:31.444 --> 33:32.532
This way.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.111
Put things in here.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.253
I don't need guns.

33:58.906 --> 33:59.950
I got plenty here.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.041
Yeah, but I figured I'd
be prepared anyways.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.827
What's that?

34:08.046 --> 34:09.656
Disguise. Handbook
said to bring one.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.658
I'm Miami Vice,
don't you think?

34:18.839 --> 34:20.493
You don't need a grenade.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.321
It's never good.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.238
Fuck around and blow up

34:26.238 --> 34:27.761
the wrong shit.

34:27.761 --> 34:28.762
I use it while I'm training.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.068
So, I just kind of figured

34:30.068 --> 34:30.894
it would be a...

34:34.594 --> 34:36.378
You heard
what I said, right?

34:37.945 --> 34:38.728
Yeah.

34:40.948 --> 34:41.862
- All right. So.

34:41.862 --> 34:42.732
When do we get started?

34:44.734 --> 34:46.171
Slow down.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.172
I don't know you.

34:48.651 --> 34:49.478
Okay.

34:49.478 --> 34:50.653
What do you want to know?

34:54.353 --> 34:56.703
All right, I guess I can just...

34:58.487 --> 34:59.662
From New Jersey.

34:59.662 --> 35:02.709
I just got this pin
three days ago,

35:02.709 --> 35:03.971
so I guess you could say

35:03.971 --> 35:05.581
this is my first assignment.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.801
And I used to work

35:07.801 --> 35:10.238
for the district
attorney's office.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.110
And now I'm here.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.200
So no military,

35:15.591 --> 35:16.418
CIA,

35:18.551 --> 35:20.857
special ops background, nothing?

35:21.075 --> 35:22.337
No. I mean, I trained
martial arts.

35:22.555 --> 35:23.947
I did karate.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.392
Karate?

35:36.525 --> 35:38.832
So you're useless to me.

35:43.706 --> 35:44.577
Listen, you clearly

35:44.577 --> 35:45.882
don't want me here,

35:45.882 --> 35:47.101
but I'm here.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.102
I'm not on the books.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.278
So Miro couldn't
possibly know about me.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.150
So, until I die,

35:52.150 --> 35:53.629
or Liam sends me home,

35:53.629 --> 35:54.804
I'm staying.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.635
We both want the same thing.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.160
I'm telling you, we do.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.031
You need me to take down Miro.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.903
Sic casus praecipuus.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.210
Let's make him fall.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.521
Do you even
know what that means?

36:16.043 --> 36:16.870
Yeah.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.176
Do you?

36:18.437 --> 36:20.482
I made up the fucking slogan.

36:22.658 --> 36:23.529
Oh.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.791
You and your yellow belt.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.488
- Follow me.
- My bad.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.663
Where are we going?

36:28.751 --> 36:29.752
This way.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.588
You've never
seen this room.

36:41.286 --> 36:43.201
This is the war room.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.247
Liam and I,

36:46.247 --> 36:48.684
have countless operations,

36:48.684 --> 36:49.859
from here.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.645
Even toppling governments.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.212
Toppling governments?

36:54.908 --> 36:57.040
The CIA have a list of enemies

36:57.040 --> 36:58.999
that they consider

36:59.304 --> 37:00.609
untouchable.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.045
People like Miro.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.831
Liam and I got sick of ignoring

37:04.831 --> 37:06.485
the root of the problem.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.749
So we left.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.925
And started The Collective.

37:11.925 --> 37:12.795
Our targets

37:12.795 --> 37:15.276
think they are above the law.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.191
So we speak for the innocent.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.541
Judge, jury and executioner.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.456
And now we take down Miro.

37:22.109 --> 37:22.936
No.

37:24.416 --> 37:25.591
No? What about the apartment?

37:26.418 --> 37:28.202
I wasn't there for Miro.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.379
I was there to
get Christopher Neely.

37:35.688 --> 37:36.515
He's our target.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.907
He's an analyst.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.561
He's leaked information

37:39.561 --> 37:41.998
about billionaires
buying elections.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.653
Now, Miro has him hostage.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.090
He's planning to sell him

37:47.090 --> 37:48.309
to the highest bidder.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.138
That's fifty million? Really?

37:51.138 --> 37:52.313
He'll probably sell him

37:52.313 --> 37:53.923
for more than that.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.664
Pissed off a lot of people.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.798
Okay, so why are we involved?

37:59.102 --> 38:00.147
Christopher is key

38:00.147 --> 38:01.931
to taking down
the untouchables.

38:02.889 --> 38:03.759
All right then.

38:03.759 --> 38:04.717
Let's go find him.

38:04.717 --> 38:06.327
It's not that easy.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.242
We don't know where he is.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.505
I read Miro's file.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.247
- He would keep him close.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.033
He's constantly moving.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.513
He travels all over.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.299
Hosting human auctions.

38:23.649 --> 38:24.867
And only untouchables

38:24.867 --> 38:25.955
get invited.

38:27.392 --> 38:28.393
Okay.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.309
Maybe we can find one.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.226
What are you doing?

38:36.226 --> 38:37.576
A little background research.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.969
Picked it up
working for the DA.

38:40.448 --> 38:43.059
And this is the
exact type of guy

38:43.059 --> 38:45.584
Miro would reach out
to, George Lee.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.150
And he'd want revenge for Barry

38:47.150 --> 38:48.369
Vanderstorm's death.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.762
He'd pay about anything for it.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.643
And guess who's in town?

39:01.643 --> 39:02.514
I'm guessing the auction

39:02.514 --> 39:04.603
is somewhere around this area.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.345
Looks like we're
going to the beach.

39:10.609 --> 39:11.784
What? Why not?

39:11.784 --> 39:13.960
Well, if Miro finds
out about this.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.266
Which he will.

39:16.266 --> 39:17.616
And you'll be made, too.

39:18.617 --> 39:19.792
Yeah, but we have to try.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.141
I mean, capture this guy

39:21.141 --> 39:22.621
and then get the auction
info out of him.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.057
Then one of Miro's clients

39:24.057 --> 39:26.102
goes missing, and he knows

39:26.973 --> 39:29.105
It's not worth
jeopardizing the mission.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.415
What if the auction's tonight?

39:34.415 --> 39:35.721
You got a better idea?

39:35.721 --> 39:36.852
Give me your pen.

39:36.852 --> 39:37.897
What?

39:38.724 --> 39:40.116
Give it to me.

39:40.116 --> 39:40.987
Yeah.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.993
Are you, uh,
controlling for me?

39:46.993 --> 39:49.648
I'm making sure you don't die.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.128
Thanks.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.003
These are
my eyes and ears.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.614
And when you get back,

40:00.310 --> 40:02.095
I'm gonna teach
you the pistol puppet.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.097
The pistol puppet?

40:04.619 --> 40:05.577
Wear this.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.063
Uh, one more thing.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.109
I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

40:21.070 --> 40:22.245
I don't have one.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.209
They're here.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.400
Give me your thing, baby.
Do your thing. That's it.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.532
That is it.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.447
Yeah. Gosh, you're so hot.

41:33.447 --> 41:35.144
I should have brought
two cameras.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.581
This is amazing.

41:36.581 --> 41:37.756
Look at you.

41:40.541 --> 41:41.977
That is amazing.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.196
Yeah.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.503
Yeah, do this like,
like that.

41:45.807 --> 41:46.634
Shooting from the hip.

41:46.634 --> 41:47.983
Boom, boom, boom.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.158
Love it.

41:51.944 --> 41:52.727
You saw how you could

41:53.946 --> 41:54.990
bring MySpace back
with these pictures.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.735
So what's your plan?

42:01.170 --> 42:02.258
I'm gonna get behind cover.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.608
Take the guards out
one at a time.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.262
No good.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.612
<i>But it's clean.</i>

42:07.873 --> 42:10.092
Right. So you
shoot the first guy.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.790
They all notice.

42:11.790 --> 42:12.965
Then what?

42:14.880 --> 42:15.794
I take them out.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.491
You take them out.

42:17.491 --> 42:19.232
And you waste your time.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.105
So you want to just
show up and start shooting?

42:23.671 --> 42:25.891
It's called
an ambush, and it works.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.288
That's it. Beautiful.

42:32.288 --> 42:34.029
Now, can you do the thing
where you turn around

42:34.029 --> 42:35.814
and like, look
over your shoulder.

42:35.814 --> 42:36.641
Oh, yeah, that's it.

42:36.641 --> 42:37.816
Oh, down from your knees.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.600
I like it. Look at you.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.601
You're a pro.

42:40.601 --> 42:42.995
Wow. Wow.

42:47.347 --> 42:50.089
<i>Walk on to the
beach, then draw.</i>

42:51.699 --> 42:53.266
I'm staying here.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.445
Pistols are only good

42:58.880 --> 43:00.447
<i>from a certain distance.</i>

43:01.056 --> 43:01.840
I'm going to
get behind cover.

43:03.668 --> 43:03.711
<i>I'm going to take out
the guards one at a time.</i>

43:04.320 --> 43:05.452
Not accurately.

43:08.673 --> 43:10.849
Hey. That was great.

43:10.849 --> 43:12.372
You're amazing.

43:13.721 --> 43:15.810
One, two.

43:16.768 --> 43:17.986
- Three.

43:22.295 --> 43:23.383
- Dammit.

43:27.779 --> 43:29.128
Should have been closer.

43:31.652 --> 43:32.914
Not now!

43:44.839 --> 43:45.927
Get behind cover!

44:10.778 --> 44:13.041
<i>Sam! Sam?</i>

44:14.086 --> 44:15.304
Sam?

44:17.263 --> 44:19.439
-  <i>Sam?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

44:19.439 --> 44:20.309
Oh.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.094
What was that?

44:39.938 --> 44:41.069
<i>Flip him over.</i>

44:41.069 --> 44:41.983
Oh, God.

44:41.983 --> 44:42.984
Please don't kill me.

44:42.984 --> 44:44.116
- Shut up!

44:44.116 --> 44:45.683
Shut up! Shut up!

44:45.683 --> 44:46.640
You understand?

44:46.640 --> 44:47.946
Need to hurry.

44:48.947 --> 44:49.730
Miro Lindell.

44:50.078 --> 44:50.775
You know him?

44:52.167 --> 44:53.647
- All right, okay, [shushes].

44:53.908 --> 44:55.475
I know you're here for the
auction. What time is it?

44:56.302 --> 44:58.130
- Auction?

45:00.393 --> 45:01.699
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

45:02.221 --> 45:03.744
-  You see that?

45:03.744 --> 45:04.876
That's how you're going to
look if you lie to me

45:04.876 --> 45:06.051
one more time.

45:08.401 --> 45:09.532
Saturday.

45:09.532 --> 45:11.273
-  Saturday? Six.
- What time?

45:11.273 --> 45:12.231
Which six?

45:12.753 --> 45:14.146
Six a.m., six in the morning!

45:14.146 --> 45:16.539
- Please don't hurt me.
- Okay, good. Where is it?

45:16.844 --> 45:17.758
I don't know.

45:17.758 --> 45:19.238
I promise. I swear.

45:19.238 --> 45:20.369
I don't know.

45:20.369 --> 45:21.849
They, they don't
send the address

45:21.849 --> 45:23.503
until an hour before.

45:26.332 --> 45:27.768
Just aim your camera

45:27.768 --> 45:29.770
so I can see into his eyes.

45:42.478 --> 45:44.698
He's telling the truth.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.135
<i>He's scared,</i>

45:47.135 --> 45:48.746
<i>but he never broke
eye contact.</i>

45:49.268 --> 45:51.226
You're going to
have to kill him now.

45:53.489 --> 45:54.360
What?

45:56.710 --> 45:58.756
He can identify you.

46:02.368 --> 46:04.196
Do it now.
Don't overthink this.

46:05.284 --> 46:06.111
Wait, wait, wait, no!

46:09.767 --> 46:10.419
Yep.

46:11.986 --> 46:14.293
That's what blood
and brains look like.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.121
<i>Take a picture.</i>

46:16.948 --> 46:19.167
<i>Short is a price on his head.</i>

46:19.167 --> 46:20.255
And grab his phone.

46:20.255 --> 46:21.648
We got to be ready to attack

46:21.648 --> 46:22.910
the moment
a text comes through.

46:27.349 --> 46:28.873
Time to come back.

46:28.873 --> 46:31.049
We got a lot of work to do.

46:41.363 --> 46:43.278
What the fuck is taking
you so long?

46:43.975 --> 46:45.150
We don't know where he is.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.021
This entire auction
is going to implode

46:47.021 --> 46:49.328
- if you can't figure out the--
-  Found him.

46:50.546 --> 46:51.765
I guess the apartment ambush

46:51.765 --> 46:53.680
wasn't a complete failure.

46:54.986 --> 46:56.204
In Massachusetts,

46:56.204 --> 46:57.815
he goes by the alias of Mark

46:57.815 --> 46:59.120
Vorhee, or Vorhee.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.644
The CCTV captured him parking

47:01.644 --> 47:03.429
and walking into the apartment building.

47:03.429 --> 47:05.605
Where's the car registered?

47:07.999 --> 47:09.087
It's close.

47:09.783 --> 47:10.262
Good.

47:11.089 --> 47:11.916
I got somebody who knows

47:11.916 --> 47:13.178
what the fuck they're doing.

47:13.787 --> 47:16.050
Why are you still standing
here? Go.

47:49.562 --> 47:51.781
-  Top that off for you.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.186
How you holding up?

48:11.018 --> 48:12.454
I lost control.

48:12.454 --> 48:13.847
That's
never happened to me before.

48:21.333 --> 48:23.552
A hundred thousand
for your first kill.

48:26.033 --> 48:27.730
Not too shabby.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.563
I want to make sure
I clarify something.

48:36.914 --> 48:37.871
Liam,

48:38.567 --> 48:40.395
he's a stone cold killer.

48:40.874 --> 48:42.571
Not to be fucked with.

48:42.832 --> 48:44.747
He would kill four
or five people,

48:45.139 --> 48:46.401
and two hours later,

48:46.401 --> 48:48.316
we'd sit and eat dinner,
and he's laughing

48:48.316 --> 48:49.839
like nothing ever happened.

48:55.106 --> 48:56.324
Fucking nuts.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.469
I remember back.

49:11.470 --> 49:12.993
My first kill.

49:14.081 --> 49:16.170
In the CIA.

49:18.781 --> 49:19.957
It wasn't the kill

49:19.957 --> 49:21.871
that kept me up at night.

49:23.047 --> 49:25.701
It was the sound of his

49:25.701 --> 49:27.703
fractured skull.

49:29.531 --> 49:31.316
That shit plays in my mind

49:31.316 --> 49:34.972
over and over and over again.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.585
But you'll get numb to it.

49:40.238 --> 49:42.980
- So it gets easier?
- No.

49:44.677 --> 49:47.288
And that's why I live
in the middle of nowhere.

49:47.723 --> 49:49.812
I find peace in isolation.

49:53.555 --> 49:55.427
You got to do what you
got to do, right?

49:57.733 --> 49:59.213
To kill The Untouchables.

49:59.561 --> 50:00.693
Yeah.

50:01.215 --> 50:03.565
We're in a league of our own.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.321
I paid a lot of money

50:20.321 --> 50:22.062
for you motherfuckers.

50:22.410 --> 50:24.325
Don't make me look bad.

50:45.477 --> 50:47.566
Don't send your men
in unless I say so.

51:07.499 --> 51:09.936
- First team's in position.
-  <i>Breach.</i>

51:14.114 --> 51:14.941
Sam, get down!

51:36.658 --> 51:38.530
Meet me in the war room, now!

51:40.662 --> 51:41.794
First team is down.

51:41.794 --> 51:44.275
Repeat. First team is down!

51:49.628 --> 51:51.978
<i>I told you not to
make me look stupid.</i>

51:51.978 --> 51:53.371
<i>Send second team.</i>

51:53.371 --> 51:54.894
<i>Send them now, goddammit!</i>

52:27.622 --> 52:29.450
Front door
has been breached.

52:45.510 --> 52:46.946
They say there's another one.

52:47.860 --> 52:49.383
Someone
else in the house.

53:30.729 --> 53:31.686
Pathetic.

55:05.867 --> 55:08.087
It can take an
agonizing thirty minutes

55:08.087 --> 55:10.176
to bleed out from
a stab to the belly.

55:11.482 --> 55:13.788
Have fun bleeding out, asshole.

56:11.455 --> 56:12.281
Come on, come on!

56:13.500 --> 56:14.501
Come on, you assholes.
Get in the van!

56:14.501 --> 56:16.198
I'm in no mood to die tonight!

56:19.245 --> 56:20.725
-  Go! Go!

56:29.690 --> 56:32.432
Hugo. Shit.

56:37.742 --> 56:40.484
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

56:44.749 --> 56:46.925
Yeah, I need an extraction
at Hugo's house, now!

56:49.144 --> 56:51.582
<i>Echo sierra. Heading
in for Tac Air South.</i>

56:52.104 --> 56:54.933
<i>Zero, two, three, four,
formation alpha.</i>

56:55.237 --> 56:57.370
<i>E.T.A. nineteen minutes. Repeat</i>

56:57.762 --> 56:59.416
<i>E.T.A. nineteen minutes.</i>

57:06.379 --> 57:08.425
Fuck.

57:10.165 --> 57:14.474
Hang in there buddy.

57:28.749 --> 57:30.751
We got two stab wounds
in the abdomen. We gotta

57:30.751 --> 57:32.100
stop the blood
pressure, pulse is

57:32.100 --> 57:33.493
one twenty and threading.

57:33.493 --> 57:35.756
I want two large
boards with saline...

57:37.062 --> 57:38.585
<i>Where have you
been all week, Sam?</i>

57:38.846 --> 57:39.717
How is he?

57:41.109 --> 57:42.459
He's in the hospital.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.112
He's lost a lot of blood.

57:44.112 --> 57:45.244
It's not looking great.

57:47.028 --> 57:48.160
<i>Tell me you've not been
out there looking for Miro</i>

57:48.160 --> 57:49.030
<i>on your own.</i>

57:49.553 --> 57:50.379
I'm sorry.

57:51.772 --> 57:52.425
<i>Trying to make
up for my mistake.</i>

57:52.425 --> 57:53.644
It's not your fault.

57:53.644 --> 57:55.341
- You guys were outnumbered.

57:55.863 --> 57:57.169
They took you by surprise.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.605
Hell, you were lucky
to get out of there

57:58.605 --> 57:59.606
with your life.

58:01.260 --> 58:02.174
<i>This mission was doomed
from the beginning.</i>

58:02.174 --> 58:02.740
<i>It's time to come home.</i>

58:02.740 --> 58:03.741
<i>Regroup.</i>

58:04.132 --> 58:05.743
I called it off.

58:05.743 --> 58:07.527
Hugo's gone.

58:07.527 --> 58:08.920
And they know
about all of our agents

58:08.920 --> 58:10.225
in the system, including you.

58:10.225 --> 58:11.313
<i>But the
auction's tomorrow.</i>

58:13.098 --> 58:15.100
<i>We have no idea where.
You'd be going in blind.</i>

58:15.100 --> 58:16.275
- But--
-  <i>It's too dangerous.</i>

58:16.275 --> 58:17.668
- We have to--
-  <i>Our best bet</i>

58:17.929 --> 58:20.235
<i>is to use
our internal intel network</i>

58:20.758 --> 58:22.847
to track and see
who's buying Neely.

58:23.282 --> 58:24.849
Hopefully,
they don't kill him,

58:24.849 --> 58:26.328
and we can start
over from there.

58:26.546 --> 58:27.504
We have to get Miro.

58:28.722 --> 58:30.158
Miro was never the target.

58:30.158 --> 58:31.377
But, we have to get him.

58:31.377 --> 58:33.379
It's not your responsibility.

58:33.684 --> 58:36.164
Sam, you did a nice job

58:36.164 --> 58:37.949
for your first time out,

58:37.949 --> 58:39.298
but I'm gonna be
straight with you.

58:40.255 --> 58:41.169
You weren't ready.

58:45.913 --> 58:47.436
Yeah, yeah. You're, uh...

58:48.612 --> 58:49.961
You're right.

58:49.961 --> 58:51.049
It wasn't what I thought.

58:51.049 --> 58:53.747
It's messy and ruthless

58:54.487 --> 58:56.315
and completely terrifying.

58:57.446 --> 59:01.233
But, um, I know that now.

59:01.233 --> 59:02.582
And if you give me

59:02.582 --> 59:04.236
this chance,
I'll take care of it.

59:05.237 --> 59:06.804
They know we're coming.

59:07.326 --> 59:09.546
They suspect anything wrong,

59:09.546 --> 59:10.851
they'll move Neely,

59:10.851 --> 59:12.244
or they'll kill him.

59:13.332 --> 59:14.420
Then there goes

59:14.420 --> 59:16.161
all that intel
right out the window.

59:16.161 --> 59:17.336
But they're not going
to kill him

59:17.336 --> 59:18.163
because they need the money.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.034
You don't know that.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.124
So what? You're fine with Hugo
dying for nothing?

59:23.951 --> 59:26.171
Sam, I appreciate that

59:26.475 --> 59:28.086
you've learned
a great deal on this mission,

59:29.653 --> 59:30.958
but it's over.

59:31.219 --> 59:32.612
I've already
sent a car for you.

59:34.396 --> 59:36.137
<i>You know we've been
tracking you this whole time.</i>

59:36.921 --> 59:37.922
No, I'm staying.

59:38.270 --> 59:40.359
I'm not asking, Sam.

59:40.707 --> 59:41.926
That's an order.

59:42.404 --> 59:44.711
You get your ass back to H.Q.

59:45.059 --> 59:46.278
I can get to Miro.

59:46.844 --> 59:48.715
Son, you're not listening.

59:49.237 --> 59:51.152
That is not possible
at this time.

59:51.152 --> 59:52.240
<i>Whatever happened</i>

59:52.240 --> 59:53.633
to taking down
The Untouchables?

59:53.633 --> 59:55.374
- Goodbye, Sam.

59:56.331 --> 59:57.681
Jeez, that was brutal.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:00.684
Sometimes necessary.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.513
You think he's
going to go for it anyway?

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:06.951
Well, see.

01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.931
God, you fucking stink.

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:32.759
When was the last time
you took a shower? Christ.

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.021
Took a shower?

01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:35.675
I've been stuck
in a fucking dog cage.

01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:38.765
He stinks.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:40.941
- Can we get him cleaned up?
-  Please?

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.377
Of course.

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:43.814
Anything specific

01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.163
you want him to wear
for the auction?

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.339
Uh. Well,

01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:48.993
for the price
that's on his head,

01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:51.125
I think we should put him in
something nice.

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.431
Maybe a tuxedo.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.738
- Yes, sir.
- And Daisy, wait.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.304
- Yeah?
- Uh...

01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:59.786
let's put a whistle
around his neck.

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:01.701
- I'm on it.
-  How about that?

01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.748
Oh, yeah. They're going
to eat that shit up.

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.749
Eat it up.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:11.319
I love it. The genius.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.059
Well?

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.237
Hugo's dead.

01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.197
Good.

01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:21.460
There was another man.

01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.505
It was probably
his controller.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.030
He wasn't a much of a fighter.
And he ran away.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.035
He got away.

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:34.473
On your watch.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.910
By the time he let's
The Collective know,

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.217
and they find
a replacement and ship them out.

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.567
We'll be long gone.

01:01:43.047 --> 01:01:44.744
How many men did you lose?

01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:50.837
Can you get more?

01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.796
-  Of course.
-  Good. I need more.

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:55.537
Okay.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:57.670
Do you want me to go
after him?

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.368
No. I don't. I want you here,

01:02:00.368 --> 01:02:01.543
for the auction.

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:03.023
Double the security.

01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:05.504
And Nikita, if you see anyone
acting suspicious,

01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:07.724
just please,
just take them out.

01:02:08.202 --> 01:02:09.290
Understood.

01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.397
Gotcha.

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:52.872
Shit.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.521
Well, I see you don't

01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:34.827
have a date, young man.

01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:37.003
Would you like to borrow one?

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.180
- What?
- Would you like to borrow one?

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:44.706
I'd go with the redhead, but
don't let me influence you.

01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:49.189
I don't need a date. Thank you.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.324
Because I was planning

01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:55.108
on purchasing one myself.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.111
This guy.

01:04:58.764 --> 01:05:00.461
Hey, man. Terence Madsen.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:02.376
What's your name, my friend?

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:04.857
- George Lee.
- Lee?

01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:06.772
Well, I think I heard you.

01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:08.252
Oil, right?

01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:09.296
Among other things.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:10.819
Name?

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:12.386
George Lee.

01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:14.911
George Lee.

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:18.740
I got you.

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:20.220
Welcome.

01:05:22.353 --> 01:05:23.136
Name?

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.659
Terence Madsen.

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:26.705
But you can call me any time.

01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:28.707
- Wait.

01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.276
In your ear, what is that?

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:33.451
Uh.

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:35.757
It's my hearing aid.

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:36.671
Hearing aid?

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.500
Is she giving you
a hard time, George?

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:41.981
I don't know.

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.940
Listen, I know him. He's cool.

01:05:47.639 --> 01:05:48.814
All right, I'm sorry.

01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:50.468
You can never be too careful.

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:52.513
Enjoy your time, Mr. Lee.

01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:53.775
I will. Thank you.

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.086
Now, where were we?

01:07:00.755 --> 01:07:03.106
Now, that's
how you tell a joke.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.708
George, you sitting
with us, or what?

01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:45.800
Yes, of course.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.106
Well, let's go then.

01:07:57.247 --> 01:07:59.162
So is this your first time
at one of these?

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:01.773
No, it's not. You?

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:04.732
Well, I've been twice. Obviously.

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:06.821
-  Still haven't seen

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:07.692
you around.

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:10.564
Who do you know here?

01:08:12.044 --> 01:08:13.872
I was, uh, I was in business
with Barry Vanderstorm.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.266
Oh, shit.

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:18.094
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.834
You know, I really didn't
know him very well.

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:21.706
- It's okay.
- No, no, no, no.

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.142
It's fucked up
how they got him

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.143
in the leak.

01:08:25.275 --> 01:08:27.103
You must be pissed
at Neely, huh?

01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:29.453
Yeah.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.066
You thinking of buying him?

01:08:34.806 --> 01:08:35.981
If the price is right.

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:40.072
I should introduce
you to Miro.

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:42.683
No, that's not nece--

01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:44.076
No, no, no, no. Listen.

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.904
I mean, you were close
with Barry, after all.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.080
That's not a problem. Come on.

01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:52.040
That's a good one.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.174
- You're killing me.
- Sir.

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.525
Yes. What? Yes.

01:08:58.525 --> 01:08:59.744
Terence Madsen.

01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:01.528
I have bought
some of your finest.

01:09:01.528 --> 01:09:04.618
Madsen. Madsen, I remember
you, Madsen.

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:05.880
Good to see you, sir.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.621
How are you? How are they?

01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:11.582
They have never been better.

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.845
This here is my friend,
George Lee.

01:09:15.977 --> 01:09:19.981
Yes, Mr. George, I'm sorry.

01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:23.333
Yeah, I was a friend
of Barry Vanderstorms.

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:26.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.339
I'm terrible with faces,
but, um,

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.210
yeah, it's good to see you.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:35.519
George is thinking of
buying the whistleblower.

01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:37.782
Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

01:09:37.782 --> 01:09:39.175
Jesus Christ.

01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:41.699
That's interesting.
He won't be cheap.

01:09:42.003 --> 01:09:43.309
I'll manage.

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:46.312
I hope you do.

01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:49.010
I'll keep an eye
out for you Mr., Mr.--

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.403
Lee.

01:09:50.403 --> 01:09:51.404
I will not
forget that again.

01:09:52.275 --> 01:09:54.668
Welcome. Welcome.
Enjoy yourselves.

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:56.801
Everything's on the house, buddy.

01:09:58.455 --> 01:09:59.369
Well, that went well.

01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:02.415
Show's about to start, Lee, so.

01:10:02.415 --> 01:10:04.939
You can head back without me.
I'll catch up in a second.

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:08.247
Thank you.

01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:58.254
Hey. Thank you.

01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:00.473
Thank you.
Thank you, Thank you.

01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:02.388
Thank you. I'm so happy
you all came tonight.

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:04.303
I know you came from
far and wide.

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.436
We have some old faces,
some new.

01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:07.306
And it's
great to see you.

01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:09.743
We have a wonderful, wonderful evening.

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:11.397
It's a very exciting night.
Very exciting.

01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:12.790
I know most of you
are here to see

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:15.271
- the whistleblower.

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.841
Yes, but I promise you,

01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:23.409
we have many, many terrific
offerings tonight.

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:25.281
And you're going to have
a wonderful time.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.760
Hey, great to see
you there, Glenn.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.109
Nice to see she's back.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.511
C'mon, let's go!

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:28.866
- C'mon you motherfucker.

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:36.961
Let us begin.
We have a terrific young gal

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:38.615
from Lincoln, Nebraska.

01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:40.965
Let's take a look at this
young lady.

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:44.055
Don't let her looks fool you.
She's a terrific,

01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:45.491
very hard worker.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:49.408
A very hard worker.

01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:56.067
Susan's a very,
very smart woman.

01:12:56.067 --> 01:12:57.547
Works
very, very hard and makes

01:12:57.547 --> 01:13:00.245
a mean casserole.

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.116
The starting bid tonight

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:04.858
begins at five hundred thousand.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:07.165
Can I see five?
I see five, do I see five?

01:13:07.165 --> 01:13:08.166
Do I see, I see five.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.689
Give me five, [mumbles].

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.212
I see six, do we see six?

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:14.651
No, [shushes] it's okay.

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:17.088
Okay.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:36.847
Fuck.

01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:38.675
Fuck.

01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:45.246
Hello?

01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:58.651
You fucking motherfucker.

01:13:58.999 --> 01:13:59.826
Hey!

01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:07.617
Hey, I, I got to go.

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:10.446
I got to go
to the bathroom, man!

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:15.320
I'm not, I'm not shitting
in the cage again!

01:14:27.811 --> 01:14:29.682
Do I see seven? I got seven.
I got seven over here.

01:14:29.682 --> 01:14:31.467
Seven over here. Do we
see seven five oh?

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.860
Seven five oh? We have seven
five, do we have eight?

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:36.341
Do see eight,
do I see eight, do I, sold!

01:14:36.689 --> 01:14:38.430
To our gentleman
right here in the front row.

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:39.779
Sold ladies and
gentleman, our first item.

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:47.613
- Prick, no way!
- Yeah!

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:50.486
Oh, you can
get lucky tonight.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:52.139
Nice one, Joey!

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:54.402
Oh, excuse me, sir.
You're in the wrong room.

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:56.100
I've got to go now. I don't care
if I'm in the wrong room,

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.405
-  I'm gonna go right here!
-  Sir, the bathroom's

01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:58.929
- back that way.
- Oh, it's that way.

01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:00.539
- Well, that guy said it was--

01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.506
Fuck!

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.117
We are under
fire in the back room!

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:16.294
<i>I repeat, we're
taking fire in the back room!</i>

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.165
Fuck me.

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:19.993
We have a problem.

01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:26.130
When do you not
have a problem?

01:15:26.478 --> 01:15:28.306
Well,
maybe if you did your job.

01:15:28.915 --> 01:15:30.743
One million nine hundred,
looking for two, looking for two

01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:32.310
Give me the two, give me the two
give me the two.

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.965
Do we see a two? Give me a two
million dollars!

01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:37.228
A two million dollars,
ladies and gentleman!

01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.752
Sold, sold, ladies
and gentleman!

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:41.580
Fuck!

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:58.162
<i>Hey kid, you alive?</i>

01:15:58.641 --> 01:15:59.467
Hugo?

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:01.382
How are you?

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.254
I'm alive, too.

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.824
<i>I've hacked
into their security cameras.</i>

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.478
<i>There's some blind spots, though,</i>

01:16:10.478 --> 01:16:12.132
<i>I don't see you right now.</i>

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.612
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.440
- Yeah, I'm, uh...

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:17.790
Pinned down.
Running low on ammo.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:20.097
How many bullets
you have left?

01:16:25.232 --> 01:16:27.191
Three. There's four of them.

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:29.715
You know what you got to do.

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:33.414
Pistol puppet?

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:37.114
Pistol puppet.

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:50.170
No shit.

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.609
I told your ass.

01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:01.442
Oh, it's just you.

01:17:02.226 --> 01:17:03.531
Disappointing.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.229
Is that the knife girl?

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:06.578
Stay back.

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:08.449
Oh, shit.

01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:10.495
Or what?

01:17:10.495 --> 01:17:11.975
If you had any bullets,

01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:13.411
you would have shot me already.

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.288
Move.

01:17:21.724 --> 01:17:22.681
Move!

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:27.164
I worked too hard to
have you fuck this up.

01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:31.472
Nikita, you have this covered?

01:17:32.082 --> 01:17:32.909
Yep.

01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:40.438
Keep him alive. Miro
will want to speak with him.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.711
Nikita!

01:18:01.546 --> 01:18:03.069
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:05.071
this is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:18:05.071 --> 01:18:07.117
The lovely Daisy will present

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.336
to you our next offering.

01:18:09.336 --> 01:18:11.730
- He is...

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.080
Mr. Christopher Neely,
the whistleblower

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.779
- himself.

01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:21.044
Yes, here he is.

01:18:21.044 --> 01:18:22.915
In the flesh.
Ladies, gentlemen.

01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:26.092
Yes,
the moment

01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:27.615
we've all been waiting for.

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:30.009
This is your big moment,
young man.

01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:32.011
Take it all
and take it all in.

01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:33.796
He is here in the flesh.

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:48.636
Who are you? Huh?

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.842
My name is Sam Alexander,

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.192
and I'm with The Collective.

01:19:29.025 --> 01:19:30.113
<i>Now say,
"“Have fun bleeding out."”</i>

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:33.333
- What? What?
-  <i>Just say it.</i>

01:19:35.466 --> 01:19:36.772
Have fun bleeding out.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:56.226
The bidding, ladies and
gentleman will begin

01:19:56.487 --> 01:19:58.402
at fifty million dollars

01:19:58.402 --> 01:20:00.752
for this dashing, young,
handsome man.

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.362
Ladies and gentlemen,
do I see fifty?

01:20:02.362 --> 01:20:05.452
Do I see fifty, fifty, fifty, oh
fifty million, fifty,

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:07.803
give me one, I see fifty,

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:11.676
What are you doing now?

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:13.460
Getting back up.

01:20:19.379 --> 01:20:20.772
Go raise some hell.

01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:24.645
So what's your plan?

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:26.386
Just run out there
and start shooting.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:28.824
It's called an ambush.
And it works.

01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:35.178
One fifty ladies and gentleman,
one hundred and fifty million.

01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:39.965
Blow the damn whistle,
blow the whistle.

01:20:40.183 --> 01:20:41.793
Blow the whistle,
.

01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:47.625
You blow it you son of a bitch!
Blow the goddam whistle!

01:20:49.322 --> 01:20:51.324
Ladies and gentleman,
two hundred million.

01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:53.457
Two hundred million going once,
going twice,

01:20:53.674 --> 01:20:57.940
for two hundred million dollars
.

01:20:58.157 --> 01:21:00.116
-  And sold!

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.173
A waste!

01:22:05.485 --> 01:22:07.661
Relax, relax, fuck, fuck!

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:09.707
Fuck, okay, okay.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.145
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:17.149
Don't let him.

01:22:26.419 --> 01:22:27.377
You got him?

01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:36.560
Huh? You got him?

01:22:43.654 --> 01:22:44.481
Yeah.

01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:48.659
Sounds like you got him.

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:04.109
Is he, is he dead?

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:07.373
- I, uh, hope that's sarcasm.

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:15.425
Oh, fuck.

01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:53.419
Dead. Dead. Super dead.

01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:55.813
What about the target?

01:23:56.118 --> 01:23:57.945
Safe and sound,

01:23:57.945 --> 01:24:00.122
man, it's
a lot of information,

01:24:00.122 --> 01:24:02.254
and it's very, very good.

01:24:02.733 --> 01:24:04.082
We should have the full list

01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:05.649
together
by the end of the month.

01:24:05.649 --> 01:24:06.737
Nice.

01:24:06.998 --> 01:24:08.130
What about Miro?

01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:13.048
Well, now,

01:24:13.874 --> 01:24:15.398
that's well done.

01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:16.573
Thank you.

01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:19.489
Still plenty of work
to do around here.

01:24:20.011 --> 01:24:22.318
Sam. What did I tell
you about grenades?

01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:27.410
You blew up my motherfucking
house, Sam!

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:29.281
Yeah, I...

01:24:30.978 --> 01:24:32.284
Relax, Hugo.

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:34.939
You can always
buy another house.

01:24:34.939 --> 01:24:38.073
We'll talk about that a little
bit more before our

01:24:38.551 --> 01:24:39.726
next mission.

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:40.945
Yeah?

01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:48.474
It happens.
