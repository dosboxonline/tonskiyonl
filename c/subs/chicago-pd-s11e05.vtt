00:05.547 --> 00:08.091
[indistinct chatter]

00:10.468 --> 00:11.720
- [sighs]

00:13.680 --> 00:17.100
What happened
to real soul food?

00:17.142 --> 00:20.270
Now they got goat cheese
in the grits?

00:20.311 --> 00:22.022
- People ain't standing
an hour and a half outside

00:22.063 --> 00:23.356
for no reason.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.816
They gotta be doing
something right.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.901
Problem is, you're still
used to that prison chow.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.153
Try new things, old man.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.571
- Say what?

00:30.613 --> 00:32.157
- Those are good grits,
trust me.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.451
- Mm. I don't know.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.870
We might have to
let Jordan decide.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.705
He is coming, right?

00:38.747 --> 00:42.167
- Uh, Jordan?
Something probably came up.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.543
You know, at that age,

00:43.585 --> 00:45.837
it's always something
with their friends.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.131
- So what's the real reason?

00:48.173 --> 00:49.591
- I don't know.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.259
It might take him a while
to wrap his mind

00:51.301 --> 00:54.637
around this whole thing.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.639
He need a little time.
He'll be all right.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.225
- Now, that I get.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.687
You know,
you ain't gotta do that.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.813
- I ain't gotta do what?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.607
- Try and protect me.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.942
Manage it.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.070
That ain't on you.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.155
I can handle it.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.448
- I know.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.242
- I been taking
truck driving classes,

01:16.284 --> 01:18.578
trying to work on
getting my CDL.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.331
Buddy of mine told me about
an opening for drivers,

01:21.373 --> 01:22.624
makes decent money.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.084
- That's good.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.961
- I'd like to start paying rent
at the building, son.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.464
Handle that one too.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.965
- Okay.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.134
Well, you bring me some of
that good food off the road,

01:33.176 --> 01:34.552
and maybe you got you a deal.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.932
You sure you don't want
that ride?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.517
You don't always gotta take
the train, man.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.269
- I prefer it, man.
Best view of the city.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.562
- All right.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.147
- Besides, I know you gotta get
to work.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.025
- I actually got
plenty of time.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.444
Wait, come on, man.

01:51.486 --> 01:54.072
This watch too damn new
to be breaking on me already.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.824
- Probably just a dead battery.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.576
- I just changed
this battery, though.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.078
- Well, you couldn't
be in a better place.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.705
Jewelers Row is right up there.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.581
- You're damn right.
It's sure is.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.292
You sure you good?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.169
- Don't worry about me, son.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
I'll be in the best seat
in the house.

02:11.881 --> 02:12.882
- Damn.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.895
[glass shatters]

02:25.937 --> 02:27.147
[people screaming]

02:27.188 --> 02:29.899
Hell was that?

[tense music]

02:32.902 --> 02:39.868
* *

02:46.833 --> 02:48.293
Hey, Chicago PD, talk to me.
What happened?

02:48.335 --> 02:49.919
- Robbery.
They're robbing that store.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.171
They have guns!
- How many offenders?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.006
How many offenders? Damn.

02:53.048 --> 02:58.219
* *

02:58.261 --> 03:00.889
Officer Atwater,
badge number 52784.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.016
I'm on view of a
potential armed robbery

03:03.058 --> 03:04.684
at 5 West Wabash.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.561
Offenders might be inside.
I'm going in.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.024
- Don't look at me!

03:11.066 --> 03:17.739
* *

03:20.992 --> 03:22.869
- Chicago PD,
let me see your hands!

03:22.911 --> 03:23.995

03:24.037 --> 03:25.205

03:29.793 --> 03:31.670
Okay, stay down. Stay down.
I'ma get you out of here.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.421
Stay down.

- Hey, just stay down!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.941
- Do it!
[gunshots]

[sobbing]
Corey!

04:26.141 --> 04:27.684
Corey!

04:29.477 --> 04:30.895
- This is Kevin Atwater.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.355
- Open this door!

04:32.397 --> 04:35.025
- I'm at that armed robbery
on 5 West Wabash.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.193
I got one DOA.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.737
And I got a GSW to the neck.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.530
I'm gonna need ambos
very, very fast,

04:40.572 --> 04:41.906
because he's
bleeding out real bad.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.116
I need an ambo now.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.242
- Corey!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.327
- Hey, what's your name, man?

04:46.369 --> 04:49.372
- Corey, baby,
baby, baby, baby.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.624
- Corey? Okay, Corey.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.418
I need you just apply pressure
right there

04:53.460 --> 04:54.753
on that wound for me,
all right, man?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.421
Press as hard
as you can, all right?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.423
Uh...I got you.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.009
Damn!

05:07.223 --> 05:08.475
Where's the key?
Come on, come on.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.934
Key, key, key, key.
Where's the key?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.728
I just need the key.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.229
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
open your eyes, baby.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.356
Please, look at me.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.528
[sobs]

05:20.570 --> 05:21.821
- Hold tight.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.658
[grunting]

05:29.204 --> 05:30.455
- Please get up.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.332
- You're awake.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.125
I'm gonna shoot this door off.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.794
[gunshots]

05:35.835 --> 05:36.795
Damn!

05:39.381 --> 05:41.007
Okay. I'm coming out.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.843
- Look at me, baby.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.969
- Stay back.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.516
Stay back. Stay back.
Stay back.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.601
I got him. I got him.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.646
Back up, back up, back up!
I got him!

05:54.688 --> 05:56.439
- Baby, please.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.524
- I love you.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.901
- Please don't die, baby.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.487
- Back up! I got him!

06:02.529 --> 06:06.366
- [sobbing]

06:06.408 --> 06:08.326
- Hold on, Corey!

06:08.368 --> 06:13.581
* *

06:18.795 --> 06:19.004
.

06:19.045 --> 06:19.421
- Get back!

06:22.882 --> 06:24.426
- All right.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.969
- You're clear. Go ahead.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.055
- [sobbing] Please, please,
let me go be with my husband.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.181
Let me see him.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.725
- They just wanna
check him, all right?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.143
- Please tell me
he's gonna be okay.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.144
- They're gonna check him.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.147
[somber music]

06:37.188 --> 06:44.112
* *

07:18.021 --> 07:19.272
- You all right?

07:19.314 --> 07:20.940
- I'm fine.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.650
- What happened?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.194
- Violent two-man
smash-and-grab

07:24.235 --> 07:25.945
turned double homicide.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.781
The first victim had sustained
a pretty heavy beating

07:27.822 --> 07:29.115
even before I pulled up.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.284
I ID'd him as the owner,
George Burton.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.494
He died from a skull fracture

07:32.535 --> 07:33.620
after one of
the offenders smashed

07:33.661 --> 07:35.580
his head on the counter.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.916
The second victim,
Corey Westbrooke,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.001
died from a GSW to the neck.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.087
Both the offenders fled
out the back in all black.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.838
- Patrol back there said
they found a witness

07:43.880 --> 07:45.131
that saw the offenders fleeing.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.342
Black Jeep, no plates.
BOLO's out.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.551
- There any cameras inside?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.803
- Yeah,
there was cameras in there.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.971
But the offender
smashed them out.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.765
Sarge, I know this here's
a robbery-homicide,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.100
but we gotta take this.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.810
- Oh, it's ours.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.561
All right, have Forensics
lick the scene dry.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.896
Let's go.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.482
Talk to every witness.
- All right.

08:02.524 --> 08:06.027
- Hey,
you good to take the wife?

08:06.069 --> 08:08.655
- Yeah, I got her.
- All right.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.328
- We were looking at necklaces
by the window.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.039
And there was a smash.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.541
They were inside.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.960
The owner wouldn't give them
the combination to the safe,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
so they hit him.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.424
And they screamed at us,
and they took our wallets.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.883
And then you arrived.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.218
- They took your wallets?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.886
- They said if
we called the police

08:31.928 --> 08:34.347
that they would use
our licenses to find us.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.224
- Okay.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.225
Okay.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.772
- We weren't even
supposed to be here.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.065
- You weren't
supposed to be there?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.567
What does that mean,
Mrs. Westbrooke?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.862
- We were just walking by

08:48.903 --> 08:51.906
when I saw the necklaces
in the window.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.326
How much longer is
he gonna be here?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.870
Why haven't they moved him?

08:56.911 --> 08:59.205
- Soon as they're clearing
everything for evidence.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.041
- I don't want him here.
- I understand that.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.043
I know this is hard,
but we're almost done.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.711
Can you tell me if
you saw any faces?

09:04.753 --> 09:07.088
Did you see any skin,
anything like that?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.675
- No.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.011
No, I didn't see anything.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.265
Look, I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.351
I just wanna go
be with my husband.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.313
- Okay.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.773
- Sir.
- No, you can't.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.650
I'm sorry.
- That's my husband.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.903
It's my husband.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.905
- Sir?
How are you doing?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.239
Officer Atwater
with Intelligence.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.783
Are you going inside
to inspect the bodies?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.201
- Forensics just cleared.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.827
- Have you completed your
preliminaries already?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.079
- Yes.
- All right.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.830
I got one quick question
about that GSW

09:40.872 --> 09:42.749
to the neck, Corey Westbrooke.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.833
If he would have been
reached immediately,

09:43.875 --> 09:45.627
would he have survived?

09:45.669 --> 09:46.961
- I can't answer that
with authority.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.963
- Yeah, I know, but it's not
for the record, sir.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.840
- Look, there are 1,000 factors
that could affect survival.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.634
- I understand that.
It's not for the record.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.843
- He still may have lost

09:53.885 --> 09:55.136
the same amount of blood
in transport.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.846
- Okay, but if the blood loss
would have been

09:56.888 --> 09:58.431
lessened immediately,
pressure would have been

09:58.473 --> 10:01.309
applied in here?

10:01.351 --> 10:02.602
Or if I would have
got to him sooner,

10:02.644 --> 10:04.312
would he have survived?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.690
* *

10:06.731 --> 10:07.941
- Yes.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.112
He may have survived.

10:12.153 --> 10:19.077
* *

10:30.171 --> 10:31.631
- We get any cameras
from our canvass?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.341
- Yeah, one.
Covert across the street.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
Kim's working it now.
- Okay, good.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.720
What else?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.096
- No pops on the BOLO.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.306
Jeep was hot.
Nothing yet from Forensics.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.558
- All right. Ballistics?

10:41.599 --> 10:43.309
- Yeah, we do have
something there.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.020
Slugs found at the scene
match a weapon used

10:45.061 --> 10:47.063
at a cell phone store robbery
two weeks ago.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.107
Details match
our offenders' MO.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.984
Two offenders,
same stats, came in,

10:51.026 --> 10:53.278
smashed windows,
cameras, took IDs,

10:53.319 --> 10:54.988
and grabbed everything
they could carry.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.823
- Well, that sounds good.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.992
- Except Robbery-Homicide's
got zero on them.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.618
- All right,
what about our victims?

11:00.660 --> 11:04.873
- George Burton, 45, no kids,
never married, no priors,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.834
bought out the previous owner
ten years ago.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.129
- And one Corey Westbrooke.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.758
37.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.221
Married to Teresa Westbrooke.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.517
One kid, Jonathan Westbrooke,
16 years old.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.062
None of them have priors.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
- Got something
off the covert cam

11:30.065 --> 11:31.691
from across the street.
- Okay.

11:31.733 --> 11:35.195
- Camera clocked
the start of the robbery.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.989
Okay, so...

11:38.031 --> 11:40.158
shows the outside of the store.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.785
Here's Teresa
and Corey Westbrooke.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.996
Here comes our offenders.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.209
Now Teresa looks right
into the offender's face.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.044
A second later,
he pulls his mask down

11:51.086 --> 11:53.963
and--and smashes the glass.

11:54.005 --> 11:58.051
But right there,
Teresa saw one of their faces.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.304
[suspenseful music]

12:01.346 --> 12:02.305
- She lied to me.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.182
- Hmm.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.435
- [knocks]

12:11.106 --> 12:14.734
Mrs. Westbrooke,
Officer Kevin Atwater.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.737
How are we doing?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.406
- What's going on?

12:19.447 --> 12:21.241
- I hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.868
I was just hoping I could
ask you a few more questions.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.662
- I already answered
all your questions.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.330
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, you did.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.374
But sometimes we have
muddy recollections

12:29.416 --> 12:31.126
immediately after
a traumatic event,

12:31.167 --> 12:33.878
so it helps to re-interview.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.047
Is it okay if I step inside
and we talk?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.050
- I have family here.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.844
I don't want to upset my son.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.929
- Understood.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.597
Would you be more comfortable
at the district?

12:44.639 --> 12:46.307
- No.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.437
Just ask what you need to.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.606
- I know I asked you
this question already.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.359
But do you think you saw
any of the offenders' faces?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.695
- They wore masks.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.448
But before the robbery, do you
think you saw any faces?

13:02.657 --> 13:03.825
- No.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.203
- So Mrs. Westbrooke,
what you should know

13:07.245 --> 13:11.958
is that we do have footage
from before the robbery.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.462
And it looks like
you saw somebody.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.839
- No, I didn't.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.717
- I know you're scared.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.344
I know they do
have your license.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.721
But we can leave
a detail squad car

13:24.763 --> 13:25.805
right outside to make sure that

13:25.847 --> 13:27.140
you and your family
feels protected.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.768
- Like you protected
my husband?

13:29.809 --> 13:34.647
* *

13:34.689 --> 13:37.567
I saw you had a choice.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.988
You could have gotten
to him in time,

13:42.030 --> 13:43.865
but you went for the other man.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.870
Why did you go to him
instead of Corey?

13:50.705 --> 13:52.248
Why?
- Mom.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.170
Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine, baby.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.717
I didn't see anything.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.637
There was a glare.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.847
I couldn't see anything.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.349
- Thank you.

14:09.391 --> 14:14.521
* *

14:20.402 --> 14:20.777
.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.152
- [groans]

14:23.405 --> 14:24.823
[exhales]

14:31.287 --> 14:32.330
- Hey.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.168
You get anything from Teresa?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.047
I was actually just about
to come find you, Sarge.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.050
She claims she saw a glare,

14:44.092 --> 14:46.219
couldn't make out
anybody's face.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.846
- So she lied.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.389
- Well, she's scared.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.224
She just lost her husband.
She's got a kid.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.351
The offenders know
where she lives.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.103
- Okay, well,
we can send Patrol,

14:55.145 --> 14:57.939
sit on their house,
make her feel safe.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.234
- Already got a detail
sitting on them.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.610
But we might wanna send
somebody else

15:02.652 --> 15:04.320
to go try with her.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.116
They might have better luck.
She blames me.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.492
- Blames you for what?

15:09.534 --> 15:11.286
I mean, nobody could
get through that glass.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.747
- It wasn't really
like that, Sarge.

15:13.788 --> 15:18.335
There was this moment before
where before the door closed,

15:18.376 --> 15:20.003
I probably could
have got the Corey,

15:20.045 --> 15:22.964
but I went
for the other victim.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.466
No idea why.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.094
- Hey.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.721
Got a hit on the robbery.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.264
My CI got word that
a watch showed up

15:31.306 --> 15:33.141
at Royal Pawn,
yellow-gold Piaget,

15:33.183 --> 15:34.392
match for our stolen jewelry.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.019
They open up real early
in the morning.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.270
- Okay, good.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.777
All right, get Burgess
to take a run at Teresa.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.863
Hit the pawn shop
with Adam tomorrow.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.406
- Yes, sir.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.619
- I don't sell
stolen merchandise.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.287
- We know that it's here.
Who sold it to you?

15:54.329 --> 15:56.539
- I can't tell you something
that never happened.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.707
I don't have it.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.376
- Hey, whoa,
where are you going?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't touch that.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.422
[tense music]

16:04.464 --> 16:06.007
* *

16:06.049 --> 16:07.967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!
What are you doing?

16:08.009 --> 16:09.469
- I'm doing exactly
what you're doing.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.305
I'm not cooperating,
because we got two dead bodies,

16:12.347 --> 16:13.765
and it seems like you think
we're playing games,

16:13.807 --> 16:15.100
but we're not.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.393
I'll take everything in here
into inventory,

16:16.434 --> 16:18.019
because it all look like
stolen merchandise to me.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.479
- Well, I got receipts
on all of it.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.064
- You can have as many receipts
as you want,

16:21.106 --> 16:22.315
but that don't mean
that it's not stolen.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.566
We still gotta take it in
and clear it.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.901
- He can't do this, right?

16:24.943 --> 16:26.027
- Who sold you
the stolen jewelry?

16:26.069 --> 16:28.488
Just give us a name.
It's that simple.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.490
That's all we need.
- Whoa, would you just stop?

16:30.532 --> 16:32.325
- Stop me.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.160
Go ahead,
try to stop me, I dare you.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.205
I don't think this is
what you want, man.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.249
- I don't have cameras.
I don't get names.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.835
- You got eyes, don't you?

16:41.876 --> 16:44.462
- The guy who sold it
was white.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.549
Maybe 6 feet, buck 60.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.468
- You got an age,
defining features, tattoos?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.638
- He had a hat on.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.016
- What else?

16:56.057 --> 16:58.601
- He had a tattoo
on his neck,

16:58.643 --> 17:00.478
looked like barbed wire
or something.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.063
- Thank you.

17:02.105 --> 17:08.987
* *

17:09.029 --> 17:10.697
- Damn.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.991
Lot of white dudes with
barbed wire tattoos, ain't it?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.325
- We can narrow them down
with armed robbery

17:14.367 --> 17:16.786
and assault.
- Mm-hmm.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.706
- Hey, so that in there.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.541
- What?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.543
The man wasn't gonna talk
if we ain't press him hard.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.878
You know that.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.047
All right, I got 12 hits.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.506
- Yeah, I got 8.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.717
All right,
let's run them by the owner.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.302
See if he can an ID.
- All units on the city-wide,

17:32.344 --> 17:34.054
armed robbery in progress
at Rose Gold Jewelers,

17:34.095 --> 17:35.388
Jewelers Row.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.223
Caller states
two masked armed offenders

17:37.265 --> 17:38.641
shattered the front windows.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.769
- That's them. That's them.
They're hitting again.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.145
50-21 David, we're responding.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.563
We're close to that.
Hold us down.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.608
- Copy, 50-21 David.
Holding you down.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.527
* *

17:49.569 --> 17:51.071
- Get out the way,
get out the way!

17:51.112 --> 17:52.947
Everybody, move out, move out.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.574
- They shot a lady!
- Come on back!

17:54.616 --> 17:57.077
- They shot a lady in there,
and they're robbing the place.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.037
- 50-21 David,
the call is bona fide.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.246
We're on scene,
and we're going in.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.625
- Copy, 50-21 David.
Backup en route.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.919
- Body.

18:05.960 --> 18:13.093
* *

18:21.976 --> 18:23.687
50-21 Ida, I got one DOA.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.480
- Copy, Ida.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.690
[loud thump]

18:30.235 --> 18:31.986
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:34.572 --> 18:35.615
Stop!

18:37.742 --> 18:39.202
Out the way.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.578
- 50-21 David,
I got two masked offenders

18:40.620 --> 18:42.205
going eastbound
down the alley on Madison.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.459
Chicago PD, stop!
[gunshot]

18:46.501 --> 18:48.169
- I got this guy.
I got him. Cover me.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.006
[gunshot]
[person screams]

18:51.047 --> 18:52.424
- Hey!

18:52.465 --> 18:54.175
10/1, 10/1,
shots fired at the police.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.177
We got a man down.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.139
- All right, listen.
You're okay, all right?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.348
It didn't hit anything.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.474
I'm gonna call
an ambulance for you.

19:01.516 --> 19:02.726
Just keep pressure right there.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.145
This guy's good.
It's through and through, Kev.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.354
- Yo.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.939
- 50-21 Ida,
got a civilian shot,

19:07.981 --> 19:09.566
shoulder, non-life-threatening.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.276
Get an ambo
to Wabash and Madison.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.321
- You okay. You okay.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.157
All right, just put pressure
on that, all right?

19:17.198 --> 19:18.783
You're gonna be good.
You're gonna be good.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.162
You're gonna be good.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.955
There you go.
Right there.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.750
Right there.
Right there. Right there.

19:31.755 --> 19:32.172
.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.089
- You got nothing
to worry about.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.216
You're in good hands, sir.

19:38.136 --> 19:41.222
- Kev.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.266
What happened?
Why did you stop chasing?

19:43.308 --> 19:44.768
- Looked like he was
losing a lot of blood.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.102
I had to apply pressure.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.645
- It was a clean exit wound;
I told you that.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.605
I cleared him.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.357
- Well,
I made a different call.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.691
- All right,
we might have had him.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.942
I'm trying to figure out--
- I don't know what else

19:52.984 --> 19:54.152
you want me to say.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.653
I made a different call.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.988
I didn't really have
the eyes to really tell

19:57.030 --> 19:58.865
how bad the shot was,
so I did what I had to do.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.325
I'll take whatever heat
I gotta take if I--

20:00.367 --> 20:01.576
- You know that's not
what I'm saying.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.994
- What are you saying then?
- Bro, it's me.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.789
Kev, what is going on?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.374
- Nothing.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.042
- If you need to talk--
- No.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.710
- If you want to talk--

20:10.752 --> 20:12.921
- I don't wanna talk.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.632
I made a different call.

20:15.674 --> 20:18.301
I'm not about to regret
stopping a man from bleeding.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.303
- All right. All right.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.847
We'll work the scene.
I'll call the team.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.147
- That's all we got?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.565
- Patrol didn't have any luck.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.734
Offenders fled in a
second getaway vehicle,

20:34.776 --> 20:38.029
Toyota RAV4, most likely hot,
had no plates.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.074
- PODs and red lights
lost it three blocks back.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.826
- Got a dead end
with our pawn shop owner.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.869
Guy looked at our six-pack,
ID'd a man

20:44.911 --> 20:46.830
who's currently
serving 20 in Danville.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.998
- Forensics also checked in,
got nothing so far--

20:49.040 --> 20:50.417
no gloves, no masks.

20:50.458 --> 20:54.462
- Listen, these men
are not smarter than us.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.882
They're smashing up stores
with sledgehammers.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.634
We get ahead of this right now.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.219
All right,
so where are we at with Teresa?

21:01.261 --> 21:02.470
- Nowhere.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.097
She told me the same thing
she told Kev.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.432
There was a glare.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.017
- Yeah, and she's lying.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.852
- Yes,
but she's sticking to it.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.563
- Well, then find something
that will make her

21:11.604 --> 21:14.482
tell the truth,
find some leverage.

21:14.524 --> 21:17.318
Or we'll charge her
with obstruction.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.779
- Sarge,
she just lost her husband.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.905
- Yeah.

21:20.947 --> 21:25.285
And someone just lost
a wife, a mother.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.454
Okay, these men are escalating.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.164
They're aggressive.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.666
Teresa cannot lie to us.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.963
All right, find something
that'll break her,

21:37.005 --> 21:39.341
or we charge her.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.575
[knock at door]

22:08.203 --> 22:10.497
- Hey, I saw the light on,

22:10.538 --> 22:12.499
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.584
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?

22:14.626 --> 22:16.044
- You missed Spades night.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.214
- Mm, damn, I forgot
all about Spades night.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.840
You're right, you know--
- It's okay.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.550
I understand.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.011
The kids, they finally
wanted to partner up with me,

22:25.053 --> 22:29.015
and we lost every single game.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.225
[laughs]

22:30.266 --> 22:31.601
What you doing in there?

22:31.643 --> 22:33.478
Looks like you could use
a break.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.896
How about a drink?

22:34.938 --> 22:36.272
- Yeah, come on in.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.278
It's hard to say.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.614
I just feel like
I made the wrong choice.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.952
Tried to save a man
I couldn't even save.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.955
- An impossible choice
is what that sounds like.

22:51.996 --> 22:56.126
And that doesn't sound
like a choice at all.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.169
- Definitely had a choice.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.296
Trust me.

23:00.338 --> 23:05.218
I saw both of them,
and I chose.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.137
I don't know why I chose him.

23:07.178 --> 23:10.432
- Maybe there's not a why.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.768
- I mean, if I could
have just seen George,

23:13.810 --> 23:16.229
the store owner,
if I could have

23:16.271 --> 23:18.898
just known
what state he was in,

23:18.940 --> 23:22.527
I would have
triaged for a fact.

23:22.569 --> 23:27.032
Imagine if I can stop
that door before it closes,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.868
then the offenders probably
wouldn't even got the owner.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.327
Or if I could have got
to Corey and Teresa

23:31.369 --> 23:34.664
before they ran for the door.

23:37.042 --> 23:40.879
Hell, if my watch would have
stopped a minute sooner.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.298
- You think you're responsible
for the watch?

23:45.175 --> 23:48.595
You know, you do this thing.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.639
You wanna take on everything,

23:51.681 --> 23:55.602
where you think you're
accountable for everything--

23:55.643 --> 23:58.188
this building,
the neighborhood,

23:58.229 --> 24:03.818
the job, Jordan, Vanessa, me--

24:03.860 --> 24:08.531
but no man
can carry everything.

24:10.784 --> 24:13.036
- And I don't even think it has
anything to do with all that.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.830
- Maybe, maybe not.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.208
But you wanna be
accountable for this.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.086
And this ain't something
you can be accountable for.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.714
Neither one of those choices
would have been right.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.969
Regret.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.514
Now, that's something
I know a thing or two about.

24:34.557 --> 24:38.436
It'll swallow you whole
if you let it.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.162
[apprehensive music]

24:56.204 --> 25:03.128
* *

25:04.212 --> 25:07.465
- I-I don't wanna be here.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.175
And the last thing
I wanna do is make things

25:09.217 --> 25:11.428
harder for you or your family.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.096
- Then don't.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.933
- But I do need
to know what you saw.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.518
- I didn't see anything.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.562
- I know you want justice
for your husband.

25:20.603 --> 25:24.524
- I want my family safe.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.568
I didn't see anything.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.908
- One more question
before I go, Mrs. Westbrooke.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.243
When was the last
time you talked

25:35.285 --> 25:38.038
to Devin Martin's parents?

25:38.079 --> 25:39.372
- What?

25:39.414 --> 25:40.874
- Devin Martin.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.417
He never really recovered
from being beaten

25:42.459 --> 25:44.336
by your son and his friends.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.004
- That happened
over a year ago,

25:46.046 --> 25:47.964
and that family has moved on
from what happened,

25:48.006 --> 25:49.966
so what does that--
- No, actually,

25:50.008 --> 25:52.218
losing the possibility
of a scholarship

25:52.260 --> 25:54.387
changes things.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.139
His leg never healed,
so he'll probably

25:56.181 --> 25:58.892
never play ball again.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.643
- What the hell are you doing?

26:00.685 --> 26:01.978
- It's funny, there wasn't
really any evidence

26:02.020 --> 26:03.938
on that case because Devin
wouldn't speak up.

26:03.980 --> 26:09.444
But for whatever reason,
he was willing to talk now.

26:09.486 --> 26:14.324
Lying to the police
is illegal, Teresa.

26:14.366 --> 26:15.784
You're obstructing justice.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.077
And trust me,
if you get charged with that,

26:17.118 --> 26:18.119
it's gonna hurt worse.

26:18.161 --> 26:21.247
- Worse than you
coming after my son?

26:21.289 --> 26:24.000
- I'm so sorry.

26:24.042 --> 26:30.548
* *

26:30.590 --> 26:33.968
He was white.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.595
Red hair,

26:35.637 --> 26:40.266
tattooed,
like a chain around his neck.

26:40.308 --> 26:41.976
- Is he here?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.613
- Him.

26:57.117 --> 26:59.369
That's him.

26:59.411 --> 27:02.455
- Phillip Morrison.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.749
Very good. Thank you.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.713
I'm gonna leave a detail car
right outside.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.297
Just--
- Get the hell out of my house.

27:11.339 --> 27:18.263
* *

27:26.146 --> 27:26.563
.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.689
- We ran Phillip Morrison's
phone number,

27:29.107 --> 27:30.442
and all kind of long-distance
calls popped up, Sarge.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.527
That man was about to flee.
Bona fide flight risk.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.029
- All right,
arrest warrant served quick?

27:34.070 --> 27:35.321
- Yeah, clean and easy.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.198
He was at home alone.
We went in there quiet.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.408
No lights, no horns.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.076
- Any sign of his co-offender?

27:40.118 --> 27:42.162
- Nah, but we got undercovers
anchored down just in case

27:42.203 --> 27:43.621
he decides to swing by.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.331
- All right, good.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.042
- Morrison has been sweating
in the box for an hour,

27:47.083 --> 27:48.710
hasn't lawyered up.
- All right.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.128
You find any weapons
at his house?

27:50.170 --> 27:51.254
- Yeah, we got a Glock.

27:51.296 --> 27:52.797
Doesn't match our ballistics,
though.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.383
- Good. Let's go. You and me.
- All right.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.635
- Three counts
of felony murder,

27:57.677 --> 27:59.054
attempted murder
of a police officer,

27:59.095 --> 28:02.932
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.

28:02.974 --> 28:06.102
I haven't even gotten
to the three armed robberies.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.146
Uh-uh.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.439
No, that's not how we play.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.775
You do the crime,
you gotta look it in the eye.

28:14.277 --> 28:16.821
You're going to prison.

28:16.863 --> 28:19.407
You tell us right now
who you're working with,

28:19.449 --> 28:21.576
we won't make it solitary.

28:21.618 --> 28:24.621
- I got nothing to say.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.541
- Wrong.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.793
You do.

28:32.504 --> 28:34.839
Just tell us. Give us his name.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.175
- No.
- One name.

28:37.217 --> 28:40.136
- I give you a name,
I'm in a grave.

28:40.178 --> 28:44.099
The man's insane.
I've got nothing to say.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.059
- See that? Look at this.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.562
Did you hear what
he just said about solitary?

28:51.314 --> 28:53.692
You know what we can make sure
doesn't happen in solitary?

28:53.733 --> 28:55.777
Ain't gonna be no calls,
no visits, or no letters.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.028
You'll never see
your girlfriend

28:57.070 --> 28:58.279
or your daughter again,
trust me.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.365
- I can't talk to you, man.
- Yes, you can.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.324
- Who you working with?

29:01.366 --> 29:03.034
- I can't.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.955
- Phillip, we know that
you've been trying to contact

29:06.996 --> 29:08.623
your girlfriend's family
out there in Mexico

29:08.665 --> 29:09.958
to get them out the way.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.459
You wanna set them up
so they can be safe.

29:11.501 --> 29:13.003
They're your family, right?

29:13.044 --> 29:16.214
- I'm not the one
who killed anybody.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.382
- But you also don't wanna
don't wanna

29:17.424 --> 29:18.717
see your family, man.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.094
One last look. Here we go.

29:21.136 --> 29:23.096
'Cause we ain't got time
for this, Phillip.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.472
- It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.682
I took one job.

29:25.724 --> 29:26.766
- Just tell me
who you working with.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.851
- It was one job on a whim.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.644
Please, man.
- Who?

29:30.687 --> 29:32.063
Let's go. Forget it.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.314
- Please.

we're clear back here too.

We gotta look for him.

- Got about
an ounce of coke here.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.588
- Got some utility bills,
found a phone number.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.882
- We got the number on file?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.551
- I don't think so.
I don't recognize the prefix.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.887
It's in his sister's name
but registered to this address.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.389
- Yeah, it's probably what
he's using as a burner.

31:29.431 --> 31:31.391
We can ping that. I got it.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.022
- All right.
Phone just turned.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.440
Aiden is still moving.

31:38.481 --> 31:39.941
He's near 47th now.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.735
- Wait, did he just stop?

31:41.776 --> 31:44.738
I got him sitting
on 47th and Vincennes.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.906
- Yeah, it looks right.
He stopped now.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.825
We got about
a three-block radius.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.410
- Copy.
We're headed that way now.

31:50.452 --> 31:53.121
We got any last-knowns there?

that Teresa could ID him,

32:06.009 --> 32:07.761
he's going there to kill her.

32:07.802 --> 32:10.221
50-21 David, squad,
I need to mobile

32:10.263 --> 32:13.767
with the protection detail
assigned to Teresa Westbrooke.

32:13.808 --> 32:15.477
- 13-06, go 50-21 David.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.812
- I need you to cover the back,
cover the front of the house.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.564
The offender's phone
just pinged on your block.

32:19.606 --> 32:20.982
He's coming your way.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.275
- We're not on the house.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.651
We ran into the station
to switch out

32:23.693 --> 32:25.236
with the first watch.

32:25.278 --> 32:26.654
- Wait, what?

32:26.696 --> 32:27.947
Nobody's at the house
and nobody's

32:27.989 --> 32:29.616
corresponding with 50-21?

32:29.657 --> 32:32.619
[tense music]

32:32.660 --> 32:39.751
* *

32:51.763 --> 32:53.515
I'm here.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.350
- Do you have eyes on Aiden?

32:55.392 --> 32:56.685
- I don't have eyes yet,
but he could

32:56.726 --> 32:58.645
possibly be inside already.

32:58.687 --> 32:59.813
- We're 5 minutes out, Kev.

32:59.854 --> 33:06.986
* *

33:28.299 --> 33:29.884
- We got signs of forced entry.

33:29.926 --> 33:31.761
I'm going in; I'm going dark.

34:17.474 --> 34:20.602
Shh.

34:20.643 --> 34:21.978
I'm the police.

34:22.020 --> 34:24.397
I already met you, okay?

34:24.439 --> 34:27.108
I'm only here because there's
a bad guy in your house.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.943
Is your mom upstairs?

34:28.985 --> 34:30.445
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

34:30.487 --> 34:32.155
Okay.

34:32.197 --> 34:33.907
I need you to go in this
bathroom and lock the door.

34:33.948 --> 34:35.408
I got it.

34:35.450 --> 34:41.498
* *

34:41.539 --> 34:44.167
[thumping]

35:20.745 --> 35:22.372
[gunshots]

35:22.414 --> 35:24.958
- [screaming]

35:25.000 --> 35:26.167
- It's okay. It's okay.

35:26.209 --> 35:27.377
Stay back. Don't move!

35:27.419 --> 35:29.170
Stay right there.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.631
- What? Oh, my God.

35:31.673 --> 35:33.550
What is happening? Oh, my God.

35:37.470 --> 35:40.432
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jonathan!

35:40.473 --> 35:42.017
- He's downstairs.
He's safe, okay?

35:42.058 --> 35:43.309
- Who is in my house?

35:43.351 --> 35:45.061
- Teresa,
come here, come here.

35:45.103 --> 35:46.604
I need you
to hold this down for me.

35:46.646 --> 35:47.981
Hold this tight.

35:48.023 --> 35:50.316
Teresa?

35:50.358 --> 35:51.818
- No.
- Come on, Teresa.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.945
Will you call it in? Call 911.
- No, I'm not helping him.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.406
And you shouldn't
be helping him.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.657
- Hang on.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.159
- No, this is not right.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.994
You don't choose him.

36:01.036 --> 36:03.371
- 50-21 David,
shots fired by the police.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.123
I got an offender down
with two GSWs.

36:05.165 --> 36:07.751
I need you to roll an ambo
to 4826 Lawrence.

36:07.792 --> 36:10.086
That's 4826 Lawrence.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.629
- No, this is not right.

36:11.671 --> 36:14.591
- [gasping]

36:14.632 --> 36:15.925
- Hang on.

36:15.967 --> 36:19.554
- He's not the one
that gets to live.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.097
Jonathan.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.934
Jonathan, baby.
Jonathan, where are you, baby?

36:24.976 --> 36:29.105
- Hold on tight. Yeah. Yeah.

36:39.449 --> 36:39.824
.

36:39.866 --> 36:41.117
- Hey. Bro.

36:44.329 --> 36:46.414
- They wrapped they scene,
they cleared me.

36:46.456 --> 36:48.750
Can't complain.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.211
- All right, good. Good, good.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.339
Patrol's gonna get their asses
handed to them for rolling.

36:54.381 --> 36:56.716
Aiden's on his way
to the hospital.

36:56.758 --> 36:58.426
Word is he's gonna make
a full recovery.

37:02.597 --> 37:04.099
- Lockup keeper confirmed it.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.934
- Yeah?

37:05.975 --> 37:07.394
- Confirmed what?

37:07.435 --> 37:09.688
- Look, Morrison said
he was calling his lawyer,

37:09.729 --> 37:11.439
called Aiden instead.

37:11.481 --> 37:14.734
Must have tipped him off
that Teresa could ID him.

37:14.776 --> 37:17.195
Everything we gave him
is null and void.

37:19.072 --> 37:21.116
All right,
let's get the book going.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.202
Hey, Kev.

37:26.454 --> 37:28.665
You remember in training
about multiple victims--

37:28.707 --> 37:30.875
who you choose, remember that?

37:34.796 --> 37:37.048
- No, I don't remember.

37:38.466 --> 37:39.843
- 'Cause it isn't there.

37:39.884 --> 37:42.637
We don't have it.

37:42.679 --> 37:44.889
Look, you save
who you can save.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.850
[pensive music]

37:46.891 --> 37:49.894
You did good.

37:49.936 --> 37:53.023
Let it be done now, huh?

37:53.064 --> 38:00.196
* *

38:49.704 --> 38:51.956
- Regret.

38:54.959 --> 38:59.047
It'll swallow you whole
if you let it.

38:59.089 --> 39:06.221
* *

39:35.000 --> 39:36.876
- [screams]

39:36.918 --> 39:40.005
No, Corey!

39:40.046 --> 39:46.970
* *

39:55.937 --> 39:57.313
- Damn!

40:17.667 --> 40:19.336
[gunshots]
- Ah!

41:01.294 --> 41:03.254
- [sobbing]
Baby, please, get up.

41:03.296 --> 41:06.174
- I got him! I got him!
- Corey!

41:06.216 --> 41:12.764
* *

41:19.896 --> 41:22.816
[tense music]

41:22.857 --> 41:30.031

41:49.884 --> 41:52.804
