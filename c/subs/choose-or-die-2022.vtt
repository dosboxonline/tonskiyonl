[developer] Since we first discovered
the curse,

1:15:28.916 --> 1:15:30.583
we've been unable to identify its origins

1:15:30.666 --> 1:15:33.041
or translate its exact meaning,

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:36.125
but we know it has unusual properties.

1:15:37.375 --> 1:15:40.958
Its symbols seem to affect reality.

1:15:42.250 --> 1:15:46.291

1:17:20.166 --> 1:17:23.208
[Kayla] The more
the one who's cursed suffers…

1:17:25.625 --> 1:17:29.666
the more the one
that's proved themself worthy benefits.

[Kayla] One life sacrificed
so another can be saved.

1:17:58.666 --> 1:18:01.375
Sometimes, the curse…

1:18:03.333 --> 1:18:04.500
can be a gift.

1:18:06.541 --> 1:18:08.791
I like that you made me look
like a superhero.

1:18:08.875 --> 1:18:11.875
Well, gotta make sure
you use your powers wisely.

1:18:27.666 --> 1:18:29.000
I've prospered.

1:18:31.333 --> 1:18:34.083
Yet somehow you managed to beat my game.

1:18:38.041 --> 1:18:38.875

[narrator, echoing] Reality is cursed.

1:20:20.833 --> 1:20:25.375
Remember, reality is the curse.
