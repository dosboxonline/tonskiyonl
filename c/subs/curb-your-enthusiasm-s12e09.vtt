WEBVTT

00:13.962 --> 00:17.967
Yeah, that's it.
That's the spot. That's good.

00:17.967 --> 00:20.169
- Cheryl tight same spot.
- Yeah.

00:20.169 --> 00:23.873
- Only Chunhua can fix.
- All right. I hope so.

00:23.873 --> 00:27.442
Cheryl so nice. She's so pretty.

00:27.442 --> 00:30.846
Cheryl too good for you!

00:30.846 --> 00:34.583
And Ted Danson.
He's handsome and flexible.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.153
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:37.153 --> 00:39.454
Don't be jealous!

00:39.454 --> 00:42.458
You brittle like wood!
You are so skinny.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.994
- Why you no eat?
- I eat. I eat plenty.

00:44.994 --> 00:46.695
Your skin so dry.

00:46.695 --> 00:48.965
- You drink water?
- Yeah, I drink water.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.266
Not enough!

00:50.266 --> 00:52.704
This is...

00:55.172 --> 00:57.339
Oh, yeah, that's good.
I like that.

00:57.339 --> 00:59.269
- That's nice.
- Finish!

00:59.269 --> 01:01.911
Huh? That's it?

01:01.911 --> 01:03.179
What about this?

01:03.179 --> 01:04.583
You're done?

01:05.951 --> 01:07.782
You want happy ending?

01:07.782 --> 01:09.418
No, I don't--
Happy end--

01:09.418 --> 01:10.785
No. You've only done 35 minutes.

01:10.785 --> 01:13.589
- I paid for an hour.
- No! No, no, no, no.

01:13.589 --> 01:16.525
- I don't want a happy ending!
- No! No, no happy ending!

01:16.525 --> 01:18.294
I don't want a happy ending!
I just want an ending!

01:18.294 --> 01:20.429
- No, no, no. I no happy ending!
- Are you nuts?

01:20.429 --> 01:22.464
- What are you doing?
- You mess with wrong person.

01:26.396 --> 01:29.708
The woman's out of her mind.
That's all I said. "That's it?"

01:30.375 --> 01:31.473
She gave me 35 minutes.

01:31.473 --> 01:32.841
You know, and the whole massage
she's going...

01:32.841 --> 01:34.376
"Oh, you too skinny.

01:34.376 --> 01:36.145
You need to eat.
You have bad skin."

01:36.145 --> 01:37.379
So, she's insulting you
the whole time--

01:37.379 --> 01:38.780
She's insulting me
the whole time,

01:38.780 --> 01:40.983
and then she threatens me
at the end

01:40.983 --> 01:42.051
for something I didn't even do.

01:42.051 --> 01:43.685
- That's scary shit.
- Scary.

01:43.685 --> 01:45.086
I'm a little nervous.
You know, she's...

01:45.086 --> 01:47.123
- she's kind of off her rocker.
- You know what?

01:47.123 --> 01:49.192
Cheryl was always talking
about her,

01:49.192 --> 01:50.426
but I never used her.

01:50.426 --> 01:51.693
I had a hunch about her.

01:51.693 --> 01:53.728
If you had a hunch,
why didn't you say something?

01:53.728 --> 01:56.698
Well, a hunch can be wrong,
so I keep my hunches to myself.

01:56.698 --> 01:58.500
No. A hunch is something
that's shared.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.369
Otherwise, it's just a thought
in your head.

02:00.369 --> 02:02.505
A hunch is like a sneeze,
gotta let that shit out.

02:02.505 --> 02:04.506
- Exactly. Eleanor Roosevelt...
- Yeah?

02:04.506 --> 02:05.907
...what if she had a hunch
about Pearl Harbor?

02:05.907 --> 02:07.509
Is she supposed to keep that
to herself,

02:07.509 --> 02:08.744
or should she tell her husband?

02:08.744 --> 02:09.978
"Franklin,

02:09.978 --> 02:12.881
I have a very bad feeling
that something awful

02:12.881 --> 02:15.880
is going to happen
at Pearl Harbor tomorrow.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.347
You must get the ships out."

02:17.347 --> 02:19.588
Could you imagine if she told
Franklin the day after?

02:19.588 --> 02:21.089
"Franklin,
I had a hunch about that."

02:21.089 --> 02:23.292
"Eleanor, you stupid twat."

02:23.292 --> 02:25.222
"Why didn't you say something?"

02:25.222 --> 02:27.291
- You're rewriting history.
- You had no hunch.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.530
No, you didn't have
no fucking hunch. Know why?

02:28.530 --> 02:29.999
'Cause your fucking shoulders
didn't go up.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.066
Your shoulders didn't move.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.368
And that mannerism's
only good for hunches and shit.

02:33.368 --> 02:34.503
See? I had a hunch.

02:34.503 --> 02:36.538
You can't use that shit
for, "Fuck you."

02:36.538 --> 02:37.906
Or, you know,
"You cheated on me.

02:37.906 --> 02:39.742
You ain't shit.
Don't come back here no more."

02:39.742 --> 02:41.744
- It's exclusive to the hunch?
- Fuck yeah, it is.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.012
You don't use that shit
nowhere else.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.447
Gentlemen. How's everything
tasting over here?

02:45.447 --> 02:47.316
- I'm the owner.
- Great salad.

02:47.316 --> 02:48.617
Are you Ollie or Al?

02:48.617 --> 02:51.420
Actually, those are made up
deli owner characters.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.688
- My name is Lorenzo.
- Oh, okay.

02:53.688 --> 02:54.991
Let me know
if you need anything, huh?

02:54.991 --> 02:55.824
- Thank you.
- Will do.

02:55.824 --> 02:57.593
Fucking berries
are fucking delicious.

02:57.593 --> 02:58.793
You know what they say,
the darker the berry,

02:58.793 --> 03:00.829
- the sweeter the juice.
- What do they say?

03:00.829 --> 03:03.232
Darker the berry,
meaning the darker you are,

03:03.232 --> 03:05.134
- the sweeter your juice is.
- What?

03:05.134 --> 03:06.968
If a cannibal ate me,
that motherfucker would be like,

03:06.968 --> 03:08.937
"Mm! (SMACKS LIPS) Wow,
this motherfucker's delicious."

03:08.937 --> 03:11.307
You're saying that cannibals
prefer Black people

03:11.307 --> 03:12.875
- to White people?
- Fuck yeah, they do.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.644
I think he's got a point,
'cause Dahmer mostly ate

03:15.644 --> 03:17.746
- Black people, did he not?
- Yep. He did.

03:17.746 --> 03:19.381
If the motherfucker did,
he'd have to add

03:19.381 --> 03:20.716
condiments on you motherfuckers.

03:20.716 --> 03:21.883
- Like, shit...
- Yeah.

03:21.883 --> 03:23.685
Yeah, you need condiments
for White people.

03:23.685 --> 03:27.022
Hey. Ho-ho-ho-ho.
I got some great news.

03:27.022 --> 03:29.658
I got a call from
Bruce Springsteen's manager.

03:29.658 --> 03:33.428
Bruce Springsteen is coming
to town on his farewell tour,

03:33.428 --> 03:36.431
and he wants to meet you.

03:36.431 --> 03:38.434
- He wants to meet me?
- Yeah.

03:38.434 --> 03:39.903
- What?
- Yeah.

03:39.903 --> 03:40.969
Wow.

03:40.969 --> 03:43.572
He was really moved
by you taking on that voter law.

03:43.572 --> 03:44.740
Get the hell out of here.

03:44.740 --> 03:45.941
- Are you good with that?
- Yeah.

03:45.941 --> 03:48.211
Great. It's exciting.
I'll call his manager.

03:48.211 --> 03:49.444
Fantastic.

03:49.444 --> 03:53.186
The Boss.

04:11.602 --> 04:13.469
Hey,
what if I walked like this?

04:13.469 --> 04:14.603
You start walking like that,
man,

04:14.603 --> 04:16.037
they gotta give you
your own fucking lane.

04:16.037 --> 04:17.606
That way it won't throw regular
motherfuckers off. You know?

04:17.606 --> 04:19.475
- This is, like, good exercise.
- Yeah.

04:19.475 --> 04:21.610
- And I'm making progress.
- I like that shit.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.811
- Huh?
- You're moving along,

04:22.811 --> 04:24.280
people see it,
everybody'll start doing it.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.580
It could catch on.

04:25.580 --> 04:27.183
And then they'll add you
to the evolution of man chart.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.817
Like motherfuckers
who walk normal,

04:28.817 --> 04:30.119
- and then all of a sudden,
at the end...
- Yeah.

04:30.119 --> 04:31.820
...like modern day motherfuckers
walk like this.

04:31.820 --> 04:33.589
- Right.
- Next thing you know. You see?

04:33.589 --> 04:34.958
You go down in history.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.058
Shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.195
- Fuck you doing, man?
- Trying to get the zipper up.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.797
Do that shit
in the car, man.

04:40.797 --> 04:42.431
It's easier to do it standing.

04:42.431 --> 04:44.032
- You gotta jiggle it.
- Yeah, I'm jiggling.

04:44.032 --> 04:46.669
- You ain't jiggling right.
- What is it with these zippers?

04:46.669 --> 04:49.638
- You're not a good jiggler.
- Larry.

04:49.638 --> 04:51.307
- Hey, Les.
- How's it going?

04:51.307 --> 04:54.010
Eh, you know, I can't get this
zipper up here, but whatever.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.045
I haven't seen you
since <i>Young Larry.</i>

04:56.045 --> 04:58.647
Yeah. Oh, hey, Leon,
this is Les McCrabb.

04:58.647 --> 05:01.450
He directed two
of the <i>Young Larry</i> episodes.

05:01.450 --> 05:02.818
- My man.
- Anyway,

05:02.818 --> 05:04.120
I just wanna tell you
that my episodes

05:04.120 --> 05:05.388
have had tremendous feedback.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.156
People have been saying
they don't look like

05:07.156 --> 05:08.457
any of the other episodes.

05:08.457 --> 05:10.325
Yeah, they did have a-- a--

05:10.325 --> 05:11.460
a distinctive look.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.695
I only ended up doing
the two episodes,

05:13.695 --> 05:17.232
- but I'd love to do some more.
- Oh. Um, well--

05:17.232 --> 05:19.668
Between you and I, I think
I'm gonna be busy anyway.

05:19.668 --> 05:22.905
I'm in talks about this, um,
Waze app feature.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.674
A movie, uh,
based on the Waze app?

05:24.674 --> 05:26.042
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:26.042 --> 05:28.211
- Ron Howard's people.
- Uh-huh.

05:28.211 --> 05:29.478
A guy called Jeff Donat.

05:29.478 --> 05:31.380
- Jeff Donat.
- Right. Jeff Donat.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.481
- Jeff Donat.
- Yes,

05:32.481 --> 05:33.782
he's in charge
of the whole thing.

05:33.782 --> 05:35.251
- Do you know him?
- Don't think so. No.

05:35.251 --> 05:38.654
I'm told he's way up there.
He works with Ken Puffin.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.490
- Nice.
- Sounds like a good idea?

05:40.490 --> 05:41.723
No. Not really.

05:41.723 --> 05:42.891
I didn't really wanna talk
about that.

05:42.891 --> 05:45.831
What I do wanna talk about
is my manuscript.

05:47.465 --> 05:48.531
<i>Hang A Lantern On It.</i>

05:48.531 --> 05:49.665
- <i>Hang A Lantern On It.</i>
- Yes.

05:49.665 --> 05:52.368
- Did you like it?
- Oh, uh, I loved it.

05:52.368 --> 05:53.770
Which bit did you like the best?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.371
Yeah, I-- I mean, there were--

05:55.371 --> 05:56.638
Oh, my God, there's so many.

05:56.638 --> 05:59.341
We need to talk about it
because I need your opinions

05:59.341 --> 06:00.676
before it goes
to the publishers.

06:00.676 --> 06:02.278
So, it'd be great
if you could give me

06:02.278 --> 06:03.446
any ideas that you have.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.914
Yeah, well, no,
we'll discuss the book.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.149
It's great.
It really is.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.245
Well, we could now.
I mean, there's a seat here.

06:08.245 --> 06:09.585
You know what?
I can't do it now.

06:09.585 --> 06:12.989
I-- I-- You know, um,
I gotta take my friend.

06:12.989 --> 06:14.690
He's getting a, uh,
shingles vaccine.

06:14.690 --> 06:17.460
- We're kind of late. So...
- Does he have shingles?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.960
No, no,
it's to prevent the shingles.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.197
It's just recommended.
You should get one too.

06:21.197 --> 06:24.633
Well, you should get one.
You know what shingles means?

06:24.633 --> 06:25.835
- It's herpes.
- Oh!

06:25.835 --> 06:27.397
- What the fuck?
- Okay. Yeah.

06:27.397 --> 06:28.638
And you've been sat
in the car with him?

06:28.638 --> 06:29.806
He doesn't have it.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.340
I wouldn't get back in that car.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.508
Wait a fucking minute.

06:32.508 --> 06:34.477
- It can kill men your age.
- Food for thought.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.379
Thing is, Larry,
time is of the essence

06:36.379 --> 06:37.947
with this book.
I'm about to go away,

06:37.947 --> 06:40.310
and where I'm going,
there's no mobile phone,

06:40.310 --> 06:41.583
so I'll be off the grid,
as they say.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.347
- Oh. Where are you going?
- A yoga retreat.

06:43.347 --> 06:45.420
I plan to get
a complete clear out.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.690
Have you had
a complete clear out?

06:46.690 --> 06:47.823
No. What is a clear out?

06:47.823 --> 06:49.592
Let's just say
it's a very delicate matter

06:49.592 --> 06:52.127
where nothing is left
to the imagination.

06:52.127 --> 06:53.262
I'm imagining.

06:53.262 --> 06:55.832
There's an old saying at home,
"Every hole is a goal."

06:55.832 --> 06:56.832
Mm.

06:56.832 --> 06:58.334
Do you want a hand
with this zipper?

06:58.334 --> 06:59.468
- Oh.
- Hold this.

06:59.468 --> 07:01.570
What?
Uh, you don't really have to.

07:01.570 --> 07:02.871
- No, I don't mind at all.
- Les. Uh, Les.

07:02.871 --> 07:04.540
- You gotta jiggle that shit.
- There we go.

07:04.540 --> 07:05.807
- Oh. Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

07:05.807 --> 07:07.842
- Hey! Look at that.
- There we are. Yeah.

07:07.842 --> 07:10.179
- Good job there, Les. Yeah.
- Look. Don't forget to call me.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.447
- I'm only here for a week.
- Motherfucker.

07:12.447 --> 07:13.616
Absolutely. I'll call you.

07:13.616 --> 07:14.984
Hey, go fuck yourself,
Crabby. Jeez.

07:14.984 --> 07:16.652
Oh, my God.
That's the last guy in the world

07:16.652 --> 07:18.487
- I wanted to run into.
- What was that, man?

07:18.487 --> 07:20.522
He's the worst director
we ever had.

07:20.522 --> 07:21.757
I'd never hire him again.

07:21.757 --> 07:23.320
- You read his book?
- No, I didn't read his book.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.860
But you know what?
Now I have to.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.762
If you weren't spending
so much time on the zipper,

07:26.762 --> 07:28.325
we would've been fucking out
of here by now.

07:28.325 --> 07:29.431
It's true.
The zipper delayed me.

07:29.431 --> 07:31.333
We would've been gone.
I never would've run into him.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.502
And being feeble
didn't allow you

07:33.502 --> 07:35.771
to fucking get that zipper
back on track.

07:35.771 --> 07:36.872
Wait... Wait a second.
Wait a second.

07:36.872 --> 07:38.674
So you're saying
that I couldn't get

07:38.674 --> 07:41.076
that zipper up
because I'm enfeebled?

07:41.076 --> 07:43.045
Feeble motherfuckers don't
even know they fucking feeble.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.681
- Okay, you know what?
- Hmm?

07:44.681 --> 07:45.815
When we get back to the house,

07:45.815 --> 07:47.149
you're gonna put
this sweater on.

07:47.149 --> 07:48.784
I wanna see you put
that zipper up.

07:48.784 --> 07:50.052
I'll zip it up.
You know how many times

07:50.052 --> 07:51.620
I've had to throw my pants
on real quick?

07:51.620 --> 07:53.756
- Bullshit.
- And the lady's husband shows up

07:53.756 --> 07:54.856
or her boyfriend shows up,

07:54.856 --> 07:55.925
I gotta put that motherfucker
on quick.

07:55.925 --> 07:57.754
I never derail.
You got zipper karma.

07:57.754 --> 08:00.329
You fuck with the zipper,
and the zipper fuck with you.

08:00.329 --> 08:03.032
Ah, can't believe
I gotta read that book now.

08:08.039 --> 08:09.138
Oh, okay.

08:09.138 --> 08:10.572
You must be Larry's new lawyer, huh?

08:10.572 --> 08:12.269
Mm-hmm. I'm Sibby Sanders.

08:12.269 --> 08:13.742
Hey, Sibby. Good to meet you.

08:13.742 --> 08:16.512
- Yeah. My name's Leon Black.
- Hi, Leon.

08:16.512 --> 08:17.747
I like that lipstick you got on.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.848
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:18.848 --> 08:20.750
That shit's beautiful
on your mouth.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.618
- Hmm.
- Mm. What's it called?

08:22.618 --> 08:25.154
- It's called, "Don't go there."
- Okay.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.989
- Okay. I see what's up.
- Mm-hmm.

08:26.989 --> 08:28.591
You need anything?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.959
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.027
Let me ask you a question.

08:31.027 --> 08:32.361
In that bungalow
I got back there,

08:32.361 --> 08:35.197
I had a lot of hit and runs.
You know what I'm saying?

08:35.197 --> 08:36.999
So, if you ever wanna get
in an accident,

08:36.999 --> 08:40.837
that could be, uh, T-boned,
sideswiped, head on,

08:40.837 --> 08:42.939
or rear ended. You feel me?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.740
Mm-hmm.

08:44.740 --> 08:48.638
Well, look at you.
You look great.

08:48.638 --> 08:50.213
Really?
It's not me. It's just, uh--

08:50.213 --> 08:52.381
- I love it.
- The jury's not gonna buy this.

08:52.381 --> 08:54.883
- It's perfect.
- They're gonna see
through this act.

08:54.883 --> 08:56.351
- I feel like a phony.
- How does he look?

08:56.351 --> 08:58.820
Like a mortician. Like you 'bout
to bury a motherfucker.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.157
- Don't listen to him, Larry.
- So you guys have met?

09:01.157 --> 09:02.825
You ever have hot chocolate
in the house again,

09:02.825 --> 09:04.226
you let me know.
Yeah.

09:04.226 --> 09:06.328
We got a little pending hit
and run case we're working on.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.364
- You know?
- Okay. Get the fuck out of here.

09:08.364 --> 09:10.060
- Get lost.
- See you later.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.133
He lives here?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.702
Yeah. I'm so sorry.
But I don't know what he said,

09:12.702 --> 09:13.903
but I'm sure it wasn't pleasant.

09:13.903 --> 09:15.338
I'm used to it. It's okay.

09:15.338 --> 09:18.641
So, the trial is in a few weeks,
and it's gonna be more about you

09:18.641 --> 09:20.509
and how you're perceived
than the facts.

09:20.509 --> 09:22.645
The facts are indisputable.
You gave her the water.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.013
So it's gonna come down
to the jury saying,

09:24.013 --> 09:25.949
"Do we like Larry
or do we not like Larry?"

09:25.949 --> 09:27.850
Well, if it's coming down
to that...

09:27.850 --> 09:29.551
- Mm-hmm.
- ...it's no contest.

09:29.551 --> 09:30.686
- Okay?
- That's right.

09:30.686 --> 09:32.321
Not in that suit.

09:32.321 --> 09:35.424
- Leon, will you get that?
- I got it!

09:35.424 --> 09:36.992
And in terms of being likable,

09:36.992 --> 09:38.795
you know what my mother used
to say?

09:38.795 --> 09:39.829
"What's not to like?"

09:39.829 --> 09:42.597
Larry, did you ask my masseuse

09:42.597 --> 09:44.233
- for a hand job?
- What?

09:44.233 --> 09:45.100
Oh, shit.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.136
- No!
- She's not a sex worker.

09:47.136 --> 09:48.670
She's a masseuse.
She's a professional woman.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.907
- Never, never did that. No.
- Larry.

09:50.907 --> 09:53.008
- Is this true?
- I didn't do that, okay?

09:53.008 --> 09:54.276
She misinter--
It's so disrespectful.

09:54.276 --> 09:56.177
I didn't do that!
Cheryl, she misinter--

09:56.177 --> 09:58.047
- It's bullshit. This is--
- Hey, Larry.
Don't talk to her like that.

09:58.047 --> 09:59.148
That's a woman right there.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.216
- No, that's not--
- Thank you.

10:00.216 --> 10:01.616
That's my ex-wife.
That's not a woman.

10:01.616 --> 10:03.152
- Yeah.
- By the way, I'm Cheryl.

10:03.152 --> 10:04.854
Sibby Sanders. I'm his lawyer.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.088
- Oh. Good luck.
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.088 --> 10:08.591
This whole thing's
a misunderstanding. Okay?

10:08.591 --> 10:12.495
She gave me a massage, and then
she stopped after 35 minutes,

10:12.495 --> 10:16.032
and I went, "That's it?"
And she misinterpreted it.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.834
True or not true,
this is an ugly accusation

10:18.834 --> 10:21.903
at the worst possible time.
You gotta fix this.

10:21.903 --> 10:23.438
You gotta handle this
before the trial.

10:23.438 --> 10:25.144
She is very upset, Larry.

10:26.311 --> 10:27.804
Maybe I should go over there

10:27.804 --> 10:29.979
and talk to her and make sure
she's even qualified

10:29.979 --> 10:31.447
to be giving hand jobs
to people.

10:31.447 --> 10:33.352
I don't think that's necessary.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.685
Does she like Bruce Springsteen?

10:36.685 --> 10:39.021
I-- Well-- Who doesn't like
Bruce Springsteen?

10:39.021 --> 10:40.523
- I mean, I can ask her.
- Okay. All right.

10:40.523 --> 10:41.858
I'm seeing him tomorrow.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.759
I could introduce her
to him, maybe.

10:43.759 --> 10:45.722
Why are you seeing
Bruce Springsteen?

10:45.722 --> 10:48.330
Eh, he wants to meet me
because of, uh, Atlanta.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.866
So you're gonna introduce her
to Bruce?

10:50.866 --> 10:52.201
You know, I'll try.

10:52.201 --> 10:54.369
Wow, that would be big.
That would be nice.

10:54.369 --> 10:57.573
- That would be really nice.
- And hopefully that'll fix it.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.835
And if Chunhua's gon' be there,

10:58.835 --> 11:01.911
then maybe Bruce Springsteen
would like a hand job.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.233
Oh, my God.

11:22.067 --> 11:24.999
<i>He changed his rating
from a C to an A.</i>

11:24.999 --> 11:26.402
You're kidding me.

11:26.402 --> 11:27.436
And you saw him do it?

11:27.436 --> 11:29.838
- I saw him do it.
- He should've said B.

11:29.838 --> 11:31.973
If he said B,
it's not that far from A.

11:31.973 --> 11:34.110
- You'd eat in a B?
- A B? Yeah, I'd eat at a B.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.611
Springsteen eats at a B.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.046
I'm shocked.

11:37.046 --> 11:38.882
I gotta tell you,
I'm completely shocked.

11:38.882 --> 11:39.982
- Well, B's not that bad.
- Yeah.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.750
I've eaten at a thousand
and one Bs.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.753
I mean, I'm eating here.
I don't even know what this is.

11:43.753 --> 11:45.087
What's the rating on this dump?

11:45.087 --> 11:47.356
Bruce, my house is an A-plus.
Trust me.

11:47.356 --> 11:49.225
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Hmm?

11:49.225 --> 11:50.893
I'm thinking I should call
the health department

11:50.893 --> 11:53.797
- on this restaurant.
- No, don't get involved.

11:53.797 --> 11:54.830
Why? Is that squealing?

11:54.830 --> 11:55.931
I don't even think
that's squealing.

11:55.931 --> 11:57.801
I don't know
if it's full-tilt squealing,

11:57.801 --> 11:59.468
but it's... it's squealish.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.970
You could be eating
in that restaurant,

12:00.970 --> 12:03.907
getting sick, and dying
because it's a C.

12:03.907 --> 12:04.941
I could've saved your life.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.308
I know one thing
about Larry David.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.878
Larry David is a man
that gets involved.

12:08.878 --> 12:10.512
Thank you, Boss.
May I call you Boss?

12:10.512 --> 12:11.880
- Yeah.
Sure, sure.
- Eh.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.216
Hey, the thing in Georgia,
the balls it took

12:14.216 --> 12:16.018
to put yourself
in that situation.

12:16.018 --> 12:18.087
I told myself,
"I wanna meet Larry David.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.155
- This guy is a hero of mine."
- Thank you.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.423
Now, you know,
he knew the woman.

12:21.423 --> 12:23.727
It didn't take
a whole lot of balls, really.

12:23.727 --> 12:25.060
The woman in Atlanta?

12:25.060 --> 12:26.823
- Yeah. He knew her.
- That you gave the water to?

12:26.823 --> 12:27.997
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.598
- Who cares?
- I'm just saying.

12:29.598 --> 12:31.166
- It's just a fact.
- Talk about squealing.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.602
I still know
I'm getting arrested.

12:32.602 --> 12:33.402
I gave her the water.

12:33.402 --> 12:34.803
You knew
you were gonna be arrested?

12:34.803 --> 12:36.438
Well, I knew it was
against the law.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.477
- Yeah.
- And you didn't care.

12:39.043 --> 12:40.977
Les McCrabb.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.145
This guy sent me a manuscript
of his book.

12:43.145 --> 12:45.582
He asked me if I read it.
I said I did, I loved it,

12:45.582 --> 12:46.776
and now, he's calling me

12:46.776 --> 12:48.450
to have an in-depth conversation
about it.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.686
Same thing happened
to me.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.623
A musician gave me a demo
of a band that he liked

12:54.623 --> 12:55.857
and thought could go somewhere.

12:55.857 --> 12:58.261
I get the tape. I put it on
for two seconds, I took it off.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.028
- I never listened
to the rest of it.
- Who was this?

13:00.028 --> 13:01.463
I don't wanna say.
You know, I mean, we're friends.

13:01.463 --> 13:02.831
- Who was it?
- No, we're friends.
I don't wanna...

13:02.831 --> 13:04.667
- You can tell me. Boss, come on.
- I don't wanna say.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.803
- Come on. Come on, Boss.
- It was Don Henley.

13:06.803 --> 13:08.271
- Don Henley.
- And now,

13:08.271 --> 13:11.006
I'm self-conscious
if I get a phone call from him

13:11.006 --> 13:12.041
or if I see him somewhere.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.577
Sure, yeah. Yeah.
I would avoid him

13:13.577 --> 13:14.643
for the rest of my life.

13:14.643 --> 13:17.146
That's... That's the situation
you've got yourself

13:17.146 --> 13:18.613
- into with Mr. McCrabb...
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:18.613 --> 13:20.683
- ...or whatever his name is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Les McCrabb.

13:20.683 --> 13:23.088
- Yeah.
- That is great news.

13:23.688 --> 13:25.421
God. Farewell tour

13:25.421 --> 13:27.724
completely sold out.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.925
Isn't that awesome?

13:28.925 --> 13:29.959
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

13:29.959 --> 13:30.926
- Thank you. Thank you.
- That's great.

13:30.926 --> 13:32.061
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.066
Larry, good to see you again.

13:34.499 --> 13:35.364
Again?

13:35.364 --> 13:36.431
I'm sorry.
I do this all the time.

13:36.431 --> 13:38.734
I forget
that I haven't told people.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.237
It's been like 20, 25 years.
I used to work at Universal

13:42.237 --> 13:46.039
when you were at <i>Seinfeld,</i>
and, uh, I used to be Kendra.

13:46.945 --> 13:49.512
And now, I'm Ken.
Remember Kendra?

13:49.512 --> 13:50.583
Mor...

13:51.583 --> 13:52.585
Mor...

13:53.551 --> 13:54.283
Kendra Morris?

13:54.283 --> 13:56.222
Kendra Morris. Yeah.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.054
Hey. Oh. Wow.

13:59.054 --> 14:00.489
I don't know
if you guys know this,

14:00.489 --> 14:03.358
- but Larry and I
used to hook up.
- Eh.

14:03.358 --> 14:04.959
Let's just say it.
Let's just say it.

14:04.959 --> 14:07.062
- Sure, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.

14:07.062 --> 14:08.632
Sure. When you were Kendra.
Yeah.

14:08.632 --> 14:09.531
We had some great times.

14:09.531 --> 14:11.633
Yeah. Yeah. Good times.
Good times.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.536
It's crazy you guys haven't seen
each other in so long.

14:14.536 --> 14:16.972
Wait a second. Wait a second.
That... That's my water.

14:16.972 --> 14:19.342
- I don't think so.
- I'm 100 percent positive

14:19.342 --> 14:21.443
that's mine.
I-- You know, I follow my water

14:21.443 --> 14:23.112
like it's
a three-card monte game.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.980
I put my water down

14:24.980 --> 14:26.282
where I can
comfortably reach it.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But as you can see, this is--

14:28.684 --> 14:31.054
It's within my hash marks.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.521
It's in your hash marks?

14:32.521 --> 14:35.324
- It's within my hash marks.
- All right, got it.

14:35.324 --> 14:36.392
- This one's fine.
- Yeah.

14:36.392 --> 14:37.994
- I'm fine.
- Yeah. That's...

14:37.994 --> 14:39.494
It's so good to see you, Larry.

14:39.494 --> 14:42.692
It is crazy how long it's been
since we've seen each other.

14:42.692 --> 14:43.598
- Yeah.
- You look great.

14:43.598 --> 14:45.969
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Still a sexy beast.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.436
Look at you. Look at you.

14:47.436 --> 14:49.105
- Doesn't he look great,
you guys?
- Yeah.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.808
You-- You've changed,
uh, quite a lot.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.169
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:53.169 --> 14:55.277
Some people say that I'm as hot
as a man as I was a woman.

14:55.277 --> 14:56.278
- Uh.
- So...

14:56.278 --> 14:57.812
- Eh...
- This guy.

14:57.812 --> 15:00.016
We had this little thing.
I don't know what it was.

15:00.016 --> 15:01.450
Larry would come over
to my place--

15:01.450 --> 15:04.181
You know, nobody's really
interested in reminiscing

15:04.181 --> 15:06.956
and going over this stuff.
It's boring, really. You know.

15:06.956 --> 15:08.291
- It's not boring.
- I am. I'm interested.

15:08.291 --> 15:09.691
I wanna hear
a little more about this.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.327
Do you remember this?
You'd come over,

15:11.327 --> 15:15.364
and every time we were intimate,
we would have sex on the floor.

15:15.364 --> 15:16.465
On the floor?

15:16.465 --> 15:17.700
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you one thing.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.800
Sorry.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.270
I didn't make you out
for a floor fucker.

15:21.270 --> 15:23.206
Why'd you wanna have sex
on the floor, Larr?

15:23.206 --> 15:24.773
Because if you have sex
on the floor,

15:24.773 --> 15:26.775
nobody wants to hang out
on the floor afterwards,

15:26.775 --> 15:29.111
so you can, you know,
put your coat on and go home.

15:29.111 --> 15:31.047
So, you don't have to bond
or, you know,

15:31.047 --> 15:32.982
talk or cuddle afterwards, yeah.

15:32.982 --> 15:34.250
All right, so what?

15:34.250 --> 15:36.185
Who wants to talk to somebody
you've had sex with?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.520
I'm sure there was cuddling
before, though.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.223
Oh, yeah,
when Larry wanted something,

15:40.223 --> 15:42.624
Larry was real cuddly.
Weren't you, Larry?

15:42.624 --> 15:44.860
And then, uh, afterwards,
nah, not so much.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.930
It's a small world, Larry.
You and Ken sleeping together?

15:47.930 --> 15:50.266
No. No. No.

15:50.266 --> 15:53.167
I slept with Kendra...

15:54.005 --> 15:54.970
not Ken.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.640
- Kendra is Ken.
- Kendra is not Ken.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.976
- No, Kendra's Ken.
- Kendra's not Ken.

15:59.976 --> 16:02.778
- Kendra's Ken.
- I am Ken.

16:02.778 --> 16:04.847
You had sex with me.

16:04.847 --> 16:06.515
Ken is Kendra. Kendra is Ken.

16:06.515 --> 16:10.186
Ken is Ken, Kendra is Kendra,

16:10.186 --> 16:12.688
and never the twain shall meet.

16:12.688 --> 16:14.290
Oh, we've met.

16:14.290 --> 16:16.762
I'm Ken, and we banged it out.

16:18.997 --> 16:20.462
Hey, this was fun.

16:20.462 --> 16:21.930
I'm glad when I came out here

16:21.930 --> 16:23.999
- I got a chance to say hello.
Time to hit it?
- Yeah.

16:23.999 --> 16:25.835
- Yeah. Let's get going.
- Think we're gonna
hit it. 'Kay.

16:25.835 --> 16:26.702
- Nice to meet you all.
- Yeah.

16:26.702 --> 16:28.404
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice. Yeah.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.072
- See you, Larry.
- Good to see you again.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.373
Wait.
You're leaving already?

16:31.373 --> 16:32.774
We gotta go. I-- We got a thing.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.576
- I'm sorry.
- We had dessert
and everything.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.412
- All right,
thanks for coming by.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.746
- Pleasure.
- I promise you.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.049
- We have more food.
- I will never mention this

16:40.049 --> 16:42.217
- again, ever.
- Can I help you?

16:42.217 --> 16:44.053
Oh, I'm Chunhua for Larry.

16:44.053 --> 16:45.354
- Yeah. Yeah.
- For Larry?

16:45.354 --> 16:47.523
This is, uh-- This is Bruce.
This is Chunhua.

16:47.523 --> 16:51.160
Oh, hi.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.228
- Bye.
- Yeah.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.131
- Bye-bye.
- What is that, Larry?

16:55.131 --> 16:57.133
- What do you mean?
- That is not introduction.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.467
That was an introduction.
I introduced him.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.802
I said, Bruce, this is Chunhua.
He said hello.

17:00.802 --> 17:04.040
But no handshake, no talk,
not even picture!

17:04.040 --> 17:05.207
I never said anything
about a picture.

17:05.207 --> 17:07.042
I said I'd introduce you.
I introduced you.

17:07.042 --> 17:09.178
No introduction!
You fail! You fail!

17:09.178 --> 17:10.679
- I didn't fail!
- You have nice house.

17:10.679 --> 17:13.110
I didn't--
Was that not an introduction?

17:13.110 --> 17:14.983
It was not a good introduction.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.253
- It was an introduction.
- You bringing
these crazy fucking people

17:17.253 --> 17:19.088
into my house?
Who the hell was she?

17:19.088 --> 17:20.990
Oh, well, she's a ma-- masseuse.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.058
You know what?
Get the fuck out.

17:22.058 --> 17:23.325
You make Bruce leave early.

17:23.325 --> 17:24.927
You bring some crazy broad
in here.

17:24.927 --> 17:26.628
- Just go.
I've had it with you today.
- Fine. Fine.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.431
- I don't need to stay anymore.
- No, you don't.

17:29.431 --> 17:30.799
- What are you doing?
- I gotta zip up

17:30.799 --> 17:33.102
- before I go out.
- What are you, six years old?

17:33.102 --> 17:34.237
You can't do
your fucking zipper?

17:34.237 --> 17:35.708
All right, I'm going!

17:36.140 --> 17:38.407
Oh, hey. Got it.

17:38.407 --> 17:41.043
- Good boy.
- Drop dead.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.135
- Hey.
- I have COVID.

18:06.135 --> 18:07.536
- You do?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:07.536 --> 18:09.705
I had a little sore throat,
so I figured I'd take a test.

18:09.705 --> 18:11.374
- <i>What'd it say?</i>
- Positive.

18:11.374 --> 18:12.708
- Do you have two red lines?
- <i>Yes.</i>

18:12.708 --> 18:15.177
It shows the two red lines.
Two red lines.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.878
I fucking hate
the two red lines.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.243
Anyway, you better take a test,
you and Susie.

18:19.243 --> 18:22.384
We will. Hey, by the way,
I was about to call you.

18:22.384 --> 18:25.791
- Turn on channel five, KTLA.
- <i>Okay. Hold on.</i>

18:27.691 --> 18:29.691
<i>Sad news
for Southland music lovers.</i>

18:29.691 --> 18:32.662
<i>Bruce Springsteen
has been diagnosed with COVID.</i>

18:32.662 --> 18:33.495
What the fuck?

18:33.495 --> 18:34.730
<i>He is symptomatic,</i>

18:34.730 --> 18:36.832
<i>which means he's had
to cancel the final show</i>

18:36.832 --> 18:39.301
<i>of his farewell tour
that was set to take place</i>

18:39.301 --> 18:41.503
<i>right here in Los Angeles.
What a shame...</i>

18:41.503 --> 18:44.340
Maybe I was wrong
about whose glass was whose?

18:44.340 --> 18:46.408
- <i>Do you think?
- Get better soon, Boss.</i>

18:46.408 --> 18:47.876
<i>Thirty-six hours
of steady rainfall...</i>

18:49.745 --> 18:52.214
<i>Yeah, I'm just calling people
I've been in contact with.</i>

18:52.214 --> 18:53.349
<i>So, you know, take a test.</i>

18:53.349 --> 18:55.012
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm quarantining.

18:55.012 --> 18:56.485
No, the--
It's very disappointing,

18:56.485 --> 18:58.087
because I'd gone years
without getting it.

18:58.087 --> 18:59.388
I felt really special.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.357
Now, I'm just like-- You know,
I'm like everybody else.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.525
It's too bad

19:02.525 --> 19:04.193
I didn't have
more social obligations.

19:04.193 --> 19:05.929
It's such a great excuse.

19:05.929 --> 19:06.862
The fridge is still humming.

19:06.862 --> 19:09.226
I think you need to come back
and fix it,

19:09.226 --> 19:11.633
but I guess you'll have to wait
till I'm better.

19:11.633 --> 19:12.901
Unless you wind up
having COVID.

19:12.901 --> 19:16.171
In which case, you know,
you can come tomorrow.

19:16.171 --> 19:17.473
Yeah, I feel like a pariah.

19:17.473 --> 19:18.474
More than normal.

19:18.474 --> 19:19.842
Thanks for being
so understanding.

19:19.842 --> 19:22.681
Let me know if you get it.
We'll... We'll do something.

19:26.848 --> 19:29.385
- What's up?
- Just contacting people.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.352
Who you got left?

19:30.352 --> 19:33.657
I got everybody but, uh,
this guy, Les McCrabb.

19:33.657 --> 19:34.989
Oh, yeah, the British dude.

19:34.989 --> 19:37.726
I can't really call him
until I read the book.

19:37.726 --> 19:39.027
Man, you gotta let
that motherfucker know, Larry.

19:39.027 --> 19:41.225
This COVID shit real, man.
Don't keep fucking around.

19:41.225 --> 19:42.764
I'll call him as soon
as I read the book.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.800
Come on, I'm sick.
Don't harass me.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.669
Harassing you?
You got me fucked up right now.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.170
I'm over in that bullshit-ass,
little-ass house,

19:48.170 --> 19:49.438
and you got the good bathroom.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.206
I can't take number twos
over there. It's too small.

19:51.206 --> 19:52.341
It's pretty sad.

19:52.341 --> 19:53.509
You don't need
all this house, Larry.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.411
I'll switch places
with you, okay?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.113
You get the COVID,
I'll live there.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.414
Shit, I don't want COVID, man.

19:58.414 --> 19:59.948
I don't know what
that shit gonna do to my dick.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.583
How 'bout I get the house
and you live over there?

20:01.583 --> 20:04.520
Maybe you could quarantine
with me if you had COVID!

20:04.520 --> 20:05.820
Hey, don't do it.
Larry, don't do it.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.057
- Don't do that shit, Larry.
- If you had COVID!

20:08.057 --> 20:09.358
No, no, no, no, no, no!

20:14.700 --> 20:16.265
<i>So then Tony says,</i>

20:16.265 --> 20:18.099
<i>"America's not going
to like that."</i>

20:18.099 --> 20:21.637
<i>He was always speaking
as if his name was "America."</i>

20:21.637 --> 20:24.540
<i>Any time the writers wrote
something a little audacious...</i>

20:24.540 --> 20:25.940
<i>...a little salacious,</i>

20:25.940 --> 20:29.879
<i>Tony would poo-poo it
in the name of "America."</i>

20:29.879 --> 20:31.780
<i>This became increasingly evident</i>

20:31.780 --> 20:34.187
<i>when I was directing</i>
Herman's Head.

20:42.526 --> 20:44.994
- You negative yet?
- Positive.

20:44.994 --> 20:45.928
Shit.

20:45.928 --> 20:47.696
<i>It's bad enough
Bruce had to cancel</i>

20:47.696 --> 20:49.864
<i>his farewell tour,
maybe indefinitely,</i>

20:49.864 --> 20:52.000
<i>but his health is actually
a real issue,</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:53.768
<i>and we don't know
how this is gonna turn out.</i>

20:53.768 --> 20:54.903
<i>Yeah,
Bruce Springsteen is saying</i>

20:54.903 --> 20:57.039
<i>he got COVID
from</i> Seinfeld <i>co-creator,</i>

20:57.039 --> 20:58.107
<i>- Larry David.</i>
- What?

20:58.107 --> 21:00.709
<i>He tweeted,
"I got COVID from spending time</i>

21:00.709 --> 21:02.043
<i>with Larry David.
If you think you're sick...</i>

21:02.043 --> 21:03.879
Oh, come on. That's bullshit.
You don't know that!

21:03.879 --> 21:05.409
<i>...don't invite people
to get together."
And Larry's got a trial</i>

21:05.409 --> 21:06.816
<i>coming up at the end
of the month in Atlanta.</i>

21:06.816 --> 21:08.051
<i>Getting the Boss sick?</i>

21:08.051 --> 21:09.852
<i>That is not a good look.</i>

21:09.852 --> 21:11.052
Oh, my God.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.288
<i>Bruce tweeted,
"I want to apologize</i>

21:12.288 --> 21:13.455
<i>to all my fans.</i>

21:13.455 --> 21:14.423
<i>I am heartbroken
to miss my final concert."</i>

21:14.423 --> 21:15.791
- Hey.
- Are you watching this?

21:15.791 --> 21:17.859
- <i>Yeah, I'm watching.</i>
- This is not good, Larry.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.628
Yeah, I know it's not good,
but you know what?

21:19.628 --> 21:22.097
Maybe he gave me COVID.
What are we gonna do about this?

21:22.932 --> 21:24.367
We gotta put out
a statement, no?

21:24.367 --> 21:26.335
<i>Putting out a statement
is just gonna keep it alive</i>

21:26.335 --> 21:28.503
<i>- in the press.</i>
- Wait. Hold on.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.273
<i>Larry?</i>

21:31.741 --> 21:32.742
Hello?

21:39.617 --> 21:41.717
- Larry.
- You were saying?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.186
So, when Larry told me
he caught something,

21:43.186 --> 21:45.154
I thought it might've been
some old people shit.

21:45.154 --> 21:46.622
You know? Like... Like, uh...

21:46.622 --> 21:48.924
Like whooping cough, scurvy.

21:48.924 --> 21:50.459
You know what I mean?
Rickets and shit like that.

21:50.459 --> 21:53.129
- That's why I have
my own Leon cup with a straw.
- Okay, well...

21:53.129 --> 21:55.831
- Oh. To what do I owe the honor?
- Well, Susie told me

21:55.831 --> 21:58.334
about your little
"sex on the floor" trick.

21:58.334 --> 22:00.902
-"Sex on the floor" trick?
- You used to tell me,

22:00.902 --> 22:03.739
"Let's have sex on the floor
because it's hot.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.073
That's how they do it
in the movies."

22:05.073 --> 22:07.410
Oh, you're a floor fucker.
You never told me that shit.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.073
Okay, I like to have sex
on the floor.

22:09.073 --> 22:10.279
- Why?
- So what?

22:10.279 --> 22:11.513
What's the real reason
you wanted

22:11.513 --> 22:13.186
to have sex on the floor?

22:15.452 --> 22:16.855
Because I...

22:17.555 --> 22:18.891
- What?
- What is it?

22:19.490 --> 22:20.759
I don't like to...

22:22.494 --> 22:23.729
cuddle...

22:25.864 --> 22:26.895
and talk.

22:26.895 --> 22:29.132
You don't like to hug the person
you just had sex with?

22:29.132 --> 22:31.295
You can't hit it
and quit it with your wife.

22:31.295 --> 22:32.901
Cheryl, listen,
if after sex you wanted

22:32.901 --> 22:34.870
- to talk about the Rangers...
- Yeah, I know.

22:34.870 --> 22:36.139
...I would've had sex
on the bed every time.

22:36.139 --> 22:37.806
"Hey, how 'bout the way
Breadman's playing?

22:37.806 --> 22:40.442
The way he controls that puck,
it's really amazing, isn't it?"

22:40.442 --> 22:42.044
But you can't say,
"Oh, I love you,

22:42.044 --> 22:44.346
and you're the most
important person

22:44.346 --> 22:45.447
to me in the whole world?"

22:45.447 --> 22:47.449
- People talk like that?
- Yeah.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.584
- They do?
- Yeah.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.920
That's what happens
when people have sex.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.221
- They say stuff like that?
- Yes.

22:52.221 --> 22:56.158
They say, "I love you.
You're very special."

22:56.158 --> 22:57.460
Men do that?

22:57.460 --> 22:59.728
Hey, by the way,
that masseuse gave me COVID.

22:59.728 --> 23:01.764
No,
Chunhua did not give you COVID.

23:01.764 --> 23:03.599
- She tested negative.
- Oh.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.968
You know,
she's really angry with you.

23:05.968 --> 23:08.432
- Why?
- You said you were gonna
introduce her to Bruce.

23:08.432 --> 23:10.707
I said an introduction.
Chu-- He said hello.

23:10.707 --> 23:11.941
Did she get a picture with him?

23:11.941 --> 23:13.376
He was leaving!
What am I supposed--

23:13.376 --> 23:14.578
You need to make it right
with her.

23:14.578 --> 23:15.677
Why? What do you mean?

23:15.677 --> 23:17.346
Because she's gonna
take you down.

23:17.346 --> 23:20.015
- What do you mean, take me down?
- She's going to "Me Too" you.

23:20.015 --> 23:22.251
"Me Too" for what?
I didn't do anything!

23:22.251 --> 23:24.153
- You did something.
- Just 'cause I like to have sex

23:24.153 --> 23:26.522
on the floor
does not make me a deviant!

23:26.522 --> 23:27.889
Okay. Well,
you better make it right. Yes.

23:27.889 --> 23:29.592
Hey,
you don't wanna get "Me Too-ed."

23:29.592 --> 23:31.394
I was in a three-way,
shit got messy,

23:31.394 --> 23:32.494
and I got "We Too-ed."

23:32.494 --> 23:34.697
Hey, I'll... I'll...
I'll see you later.

23:34.697 --> 23:36.198
Have you ever had sex
on the floor?

23:36.198 --> 23:37.500
Of course, I did.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.235
Know what's even better?
Fucking in mud.

24:08.265 --> 24:10.667
Hey, hey.

24:10.667 --> 24:11.834
All better!

24:11.834 --> 24:12.869
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.570
- COVID negative?
- Negative.

24:14.570 --> 24:16.138
Ah. Congratulations.

24:16.138 --> 24:17.907
- Yeah. Oh, boy.
- I got news for you.

24:17.907 --> 24:20.810
- Yeah?
- Susie's got COVID.

24:20.810 --> 24:23.045
- Oh, my God.
- Susie's stuck upstairs.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.047
I got the whole first floor
to myself.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.715
- This is unbelievable.
- Oh, it's a dream.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.551
It's Jeff World down here.
I do whatever I want.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.220
Who's down there
with you, Jeffrey?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.755
- It's Larry.
- Hey.

24:32.755 --> 24:34.257
He's not supposed to be here.

24:34.257 --> 24:35.724
What? I have immunity.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.194
- Oh, you think so?
- And can I tell you something?
I feel like Superman.

24:38.194 --> 24:41.030
- Do you really?
- I can go anywhere, do anything.

24:41.030 --> 24:42.932
How could you be so happy
right now?

24:42.932 --> 24:44.834
You gave Bruce COVID, Larry!

24:44.834 --> 24:47.036
You destroyed his life,
his career.

24:47.036 --> 24:49.204
He might never play
or sing again.

24:49.204 --> 24:51.773
- Poor Boss. Oh, the poor Boss.
- That's right, poor Boss.

24:51.773 --> 24:55.377
- His fans are devastated.
- Oh, the poor fans.

24:55.377 --> 24:57.146
Everybody fucking hates you now.

24:57.146 --> 24:58.848
- Oh.
- It's all your fault.

24:58.848 --> 25:00.916
You're a walking fucking virus,
Larry!

25:00.916 --> 25:02.751
Let me tell you something!
You're the virus!

25:02.751 --> 25:05.021
Injecting yourself
into everybody's lives!

25:05.021 --> 25:06.655
- You're the virus!
- You're the virus!

25:06.655 --> 25:08.657
You're the virus!
You're the virus!

25:08.657 --> 25:11.326
Your entire aura
is viral overload!

25:11.326 --> 25:13.930
I have a fantastic aura!
Jeff, don't I have a good aura?

25:13.930 --> 25:15.064
- A great aura.
- I have a great--

25:15.064 --> 25:18.200
Susie,
leave the man's aura alone.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.469
It's an epic aura.
I have a Hall of Fame aura.

25:20.469 --> 25:24.440
You're small. You're petty.
You're jealous. You're trite.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.442
I would rather be
all those things

25:27.442 --> 25:31.179
than the tattletale you are.
You had to tell Cheryl
I like to have sex on the floor?

25:31.179 --> 25:33.682
- Oh, yeah. I had to tell.
Yes, I did have to tell.
- What the hell is that?

25:33.682 --> 25:35.050
- You're a squealer!
- It was criminal.

25:35.050 --> 25:36.753
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself,

25:36.753 --> 25:38.587
squealing like a little pig.

25:38.587 --> 25:39.889
The fact
that you wouldn't be intimate

25:39.889 --> 25:41.856
and cuddle
with your own fucking wife.

25:41.856 --> 25:43.927
What kind
of ingrate human being are you?

25:43.927 --> 25:45.194
Oh, you know what?
Go fuck yourself.

25:45.194 --> 25:47.096
I hope you're up here
for another three weeks.

25:47.096 --> 25:50.232
You cold-hearted,
COVID-carrying cocksucker!

25:50.232 --> 25:51.835
Hey,
let's go watch the game.

25:51.835 --> 25:53.197
Yeah.

25:53.197 --> 25:54.904
Drove by Ollie and Al's.

25:54.904 --> 25:56.672
- A is still up.
- You're kidding.

25:56.672 --> 25:58.306
- No.
- Where does that guy get off?

25:58.306 --> 26:01.243
I'm gonna talk to him about it.

26:01.243 --> 26:04.013
You have bad foot.
Stop. Go. Stop. Go.

26:04.013 --> 26:05.514
- This no smooth ride.
- Oh, please.

26:05.514 --> 26:07.550
- Herky-jerky.
- Oh, my God.

26:07.550 --> 26:09.585
When we see Bruce today,
I want photo.

26:09.585 --> 26:10.885
Yeah, great.

26:10.885 --> 26:13.588
Yeah, I don't even know
how we're even getting in, okay?

26:13.588 --> 26:15.624
I masseuse.
Masseuse always get in.

26:15.624 --> 26:17.226
- Oh. Yeah.
- Bruce!

26:17.226 --> 26:19.861
- Um. Oh, jeez. Uh-oh.
- Get well soon!

26:19.861 --> 26:21.130
Bruce!

26:21.130 --> 26:23.066
- We love you!
- Bruce!

26:23.066 --> 26:24.767
- We miss you!
- Bruce!

26:24.767 --> 26:26.936
<i>Asbury Park</i> rules!

26:26.936 --> 26:30.008
Um, all right,
I gotta pull over.

26:30.541 --> 26:31.840
Why stop here?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.977
- You're gonna have to drive.
- Bruce!

26:33.977 --> 26:36.512
- We're sending our love!
- Bruce!

26:36.512 --> 26:37.974
Feel better, please.

26:37.974 --> 26:40.283
- We need you
back on tour, man!
- Bruce!

26:40.283 --> 26:42.451
I still don't get
how you're gonna get in here.

26:42.451 --> 26:44.286
- It's impossible.
- Leave it to me.

26:44.286 --> 26:46.188
We're praying
for you!

26:46.188 --> 26:48.657
<i>Hello?</i>
- Massage!

26:48.657 --> 26:51.026
- <i>Excuse me!</i>
- Massage!

26:51.026 --> 26:53.362
<i>I'm sorry, uh,
we did not order a massage.</i>

26:53.362 --> 26:56.732
Somebody in this house
order massage. Open gate.

26:56.732 --> 26:58.867
<i>No, no one
in this house ordered a massage.</i>

26:58.867 --> 27:02.905
You order massage. 362 Bristol.
Open gate or I leave,

27:02.905 --> 27:04.243
and you pay me.

27:05.276 --> 27:06.308
<i>Uh...</i>

27:06.308 --> 27:08.511
<i>Okay, come on in.</i>

27:08.511 --> 27:10.583
Unbelievable.

27:11.315 --> 27:12.549
Bruce!

27:12.549 --> 27:13.886
Larry.

27:14.619 --> 27:15.384
Larry.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.853
- Yeah.
- Where Bruce?

27:16.853 --> 27:18.152
One second. Follow me.

27:18.152 --> 27:21.227
Whoo! Springsteen!

27:30.568 --> 27:32.067
<i>A house divided</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:35.972
<i>against itself cannot stand.</i>

27:35.972 --> 27:38.007
Ah.

27:38.007 --> 27:39.942
Hey.

27:39.942 --> 27:41.811
Bruce!

27:41.811 --> 27:43.478
- What the fuck?
- Hey.

27:43.478 --> 27:44.747
- Hey, man.
- Larry.

27:44.747 --> 27:45.747
Yeah.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.516
What are you doing
in my backyard,

27:47.516 --> 27:48.985
and how did you get in here?

27:48.985 --> 27:50.319
Oh, I laid down
on the floor of the car.

27:50.319 --> 27:52.789
She said she was your masseuse.
They let her in.

27:52.789 --> 27:54.056
- What?
- By the way,

27:54.056 --> 27:55.124
there's a lot of people
out there.

27:55.124 --> 27:57.226
Yeah,
because they think I'm dying

27:57.226 --> 27:58.961
from the COVID
I caught from you.

27:58.961 --> 28:01.030
Mr. Three-Card Monte
with the glasses.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.298
That's where it happened.

28:02.298 --> 28:04.767
Hey,
I'm almost 99.9 percent sure

28:04.767 --> 28:06.035
that was my glass, Bruce.

28:06.035 --> 28:07.937
I lost my sense of smell.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.973
I'm so sorry.
There's nothing to smell.

28:09.973 --> 28:11.373
Everything stinks.
It doesn't matter.

28:11.373 --> 28:13.076
- Fuck.
- You're better off.

28:13.076 --> 28:14.543
Hey, what are you watching?

28:14.543 --> 28:16.740
- Uh, <i>Young Mr. Lincoln.</i>
- <i>Lincoln in Illinois?</i>

28:16.740 --> 28:18.480
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I love that movie.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.849
A house divided

28:19.849 --> 28:21.983
against itself cannot stand.

28:21.983 --> 28:24.353
That's a good Massey.
Now get the fuck out, please.

28:24.353 --> 28:26.755
Okay. Hey, um,
do you remember Chunhua?

28:26.755 --> 28:28.852
Bruce.
I love you, Bruce.

28:28.852 --> 28:30.793
She didn't get a chance
to talk to you last time.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.794
She-- You know,
she's a big fan.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.463
- She just want one-- Just--
- One photo.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.199
I'm sick as a fucking dog.
It's not really the best time.

28:37.199 --> 28:38.567
- It'll just take one second.
- One photo.

28:38.567 --> 28:39.902
- It'll take one second.
- What?

28:39.902 --> 28:41.137
- Thank you.
- There you go.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.572
Wha-- Larry--

28:43.572 --> 28:45.274
- Okay. There you go.
- Show me. Show me.

28:45.274 --> 28:46.876
Okay, man.
Jesus Christ.

28:46.876 --> 28:49.077
No, Bruce,
only me and reflection.

28:49.077 --> 28:50.747
- What am I supposed
to do?
- Take photo!

28:50.747 --> 28:52.048
This is the last one!

28:52.048 --> 28:53.282
- Larry, Larry...
- Take photo,

28:53.282 --> 28:54.483
- you dumb, bald man.
- ...take the fucking photo!

28:54.483 --> 28:55.917
- I took it! I took it!
- Photo, Larry.

28:55.917 --> 28:56.920
- Larry, what are you doing?
- Oh. Yeah.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.021
You guys can't be here.

28:58.021 --> 28:59.849
- He doesn't feel well.
- Yeah.

28:59.849 --> 29:01.590
- I'm sick.
- Yeah.
You gotta get out of here.

29:01.590 --> 29:04.126
I'm sorry about this.
I totally had a hunch

29:04.126 --> 29:05.327
- that this was not
a good idea...
- Yeah, you know,

29:05.327 --> 29:06.595
- you had a hunch.
- ...that you meet Bruce.

29:06.595 --> 29:08.330
That's not a hunch.
I think you want all the credit

29:08.330 --> 29:09.926
for being right
without doing any of the work.

29:09.926 --> 29:12.001
If you had a hunch,
you should've said something.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.002
- There you go. There you go.
- Yeah.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.537
You need to get out of here,
Larry.

29:14.537 --> 29:16.237
All right.
We'll take our leave now.

29:16.237 --> 29:18.140
- Come on. Come on.
Please, no photos. Yeah.
- Ah, Jesus Christ.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.408
- Steven, may I add...
- Let's go.

29:19.408 --> 29:22.211
...we're very honored
and appreciative of the time

29:22.211 --> 29:24.280
- we got to spend here.
- Yep. Let's go.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.483
Mary,
why do you constantly insult me

29:27.483 --> 29:29.018
in front of my friends?

29:31.052 --> 29:32.255
<i>Would we not rather say</i>

29:32.255 --> 29:34.057
<i>the remedy is in our hands?</i>

29:34.057 --> 29:36.726
Fucking Larry.

29:38.494 --> 29:40.730
Do you--
You got what you needed, right?

29:42.865 --> 29:45.000
Oh, my God, it's Larry David!

29:45.000 --> 29:47.569
You gave Bruce COVID,
you psycho!

29:47.569 --> 29:50.071
No, no! No, no, no!

29:50.071 --> 29:52.541
- I didn't give him COVID!
- You ruined the tour.
I had front row seats.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.977
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- It was my last chance
to see him.

29:54.977 --> 29:57.213
- He gave me COVID! Holy shit!
- Drive! Drive!

29:57.213 --> 30:00.419
No, no, no! Hey, hey!

30:01.586 --> 30:03.055
Go, go, go!

30:05.824 --> 30:07.059
Oh, my God.

30:12.261 --> 30:15.331
<i>Did Patricia Heaton get
a little handsy?</i>

30:15.331 --> 30:18.034
<i>Well, that is a tale
for my next book,</i>

30:18.034 --> 30:20.339
<i>because that's a wrap!</i>

30:24.676 --> 30:25.541
What a piece of shit.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.009
Now you gotta call
that motherfucker.

30:27.009 --> 30:28.344
What's up, fellas?
Keeping it light today.

30:28.344 --> 30:31.347
Lorenzo. I saw what you did.

30:31.347 --> 30:35.284
I saw you change the sign
from a C to an A.

30:35.284 --> 30:38.291
So, I'm not about to eat food
from your restaurant.

30:38.890 --> 30:40.222
That C was undeserved.

30:40.222 --> 30:41.690
Oh, really? How so?

30:41.690 --> 30:45.121
One of my guys had sex
with a waitress on the floor.

30:45.121 --> 30:48.197
Health department found out,
and then, boom, we got a C.

30:48.197 --> 30:49.498
Doesn't even make any sense.

30:49.498 --> 30:51.233
Why have sex with anybody
on a floor?

30:51.233 --> 30:52.836
There's plenty of places
to have sex.

30:52.836 --> 30:54.336
I have a couch in my office.

30:54.336 --> 30:56.105
Maybe he just knows that women

30:56.105 --> 30:57.807
don't wanna hang out
on the floor and...

30:57.807 --> 30:59.174
and that he can have sex

30:59.174 --> 31:02.111
and then just get dressed
and, uh, go about his business.

31:02.111 --> 31:04.147
You know, I considered that,

31:04.147 --> 31:07.153
and that pisses me off
more than this fucking C.

31:08.119 --> 31:09.185
What kind of asshole

31:09.185 --> 31:11.354
doesn't want
to cuddle after sex?

31:11.354 --> 31:14.023
That's what separates us
from animals.

31:14.023 --> 31:16.926
We're not two badgers fucking
in the woods.

31:16.926 --> 31:19.394
We are people
who love one another.

31:19.394 --> 31:21.530
Woman just gives herself
to you like that,

31:21.530 --> 31:23.833
and you're not gonna spend
a little time thanking her?

31:23.833 --> 31:25.568
And the fact
that he couldn't throw

31:25.568 --> 31:26.896
an arm around her,

31:26.896 --> 31:29.572
talk about the rest
of her fucking day.

31:29.572 --> 31:31.773
What's she gonna do?
Where's she gonna go?

31:31.773 --> 31:35.511
It just takes one minute
of common fucking courtesy.

31:35.511 --> 31:37.980
There's never an excuse
not to cuddle.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.786
That guy
is a straight up sick fuck.

31:41.552 --> 31:42.985
Well, you know...

31:42.985 --> 31:44.620
...we don't know anything
about this guy.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.288
Maybe he's just a nice guy
in a hurry.

31:46.288 --> 31:48.657
No. He is a dirty floor fucker

31:48.657 --> 31:50.596
who doesn't deserve
to live amongst us.

31:51.595 --> 31:53.229
You know what?
This is all on me.

31:53.229 --> 31:55.501
- Really?
- The place is clean.

31:56.568 --> 31:57.570
We deserve an A.

31:58.503 --> 32:00.536
I'd like to meet this guy.

32:00.536 --> 32:02.438
- We got something in common.
- You do.

32:02.438 --> 32:03.939
I could probably be friends
with this guy.

32:03.939 --> 32:07.944
I only did it in my house.
He's doing it in restaurants.

32:07.944 --> 32:09.212
- Yeah.
- It's sad to think

32:09.212 --> 32:11.480
that there might be a guy
out there

32:11.480 --> 32:14.884
- who has sex on the floor...
- Yeah.

32:14.884 --> 32:16.051
...and I'm never gonna meet him.

32:16.051 --> 32:17.653
Yeah, that's deep shit
right there.

32:17.653 --> 32:21.357
- All right. Let's go.
- Wait.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.425
What the fuck is happening here?
You read the book.

32:23.425 --> 32:24.593
You know what time it is now?

32:24.593 --> 32:25.856
You gotta call
this motherfucker.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.333
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.
One second.

32:28.332 --> 32:29.699
You gotta do
that shit right now?

32:29.699 --> 32:30.532
Every moment counts.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.900
You gonna put
that shit off again,

32:31.900 --> 32:34.703
and this motherfucker's
walking around, spreading Rona.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.339
- Ah. Okay. Got it.
- There you go. See?

32:37.339 --> 32:39.141
Now call that
sorry-ass English motherfucker

32:39.141 --> 32:41.611
and let him know
he got the Rona.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.045
Namaste, sister.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.715
- Thank you.
- Mahmoud!

32:45.715 --> 32:47.016
Lovely to see you again.

32:47.016 --> 32:48.584
Wonderful to see you too, brother.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.386
Bye-bye, phone.
See you in a week.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.586
Hmm.

32:51.586 --> 32:53.388
Here you are, everybody!

32:53.388 --> 32:54.656
Hey, hey, hey!
How is everyone?

32:54.656 --> 32:56.258
Fantastic to see you.

32:56.258 --> 32:58.828
I didn't sleep last night.
I was so excited.

32:58.828 --> 33:00.930
There you are. Give me a kiss.

33:00.930 --> 33:02.164
- Come close.
- Big hugs.

33:02.164 --> 33:03.599
I was hoping you'd be here.

33:03.599 --> 33:05.368
- My brother tells me
you're pregnant again.
- Twins.

33:05.368 --> 33:06.668
- Let's do this.
- All right, Les.

33:06.668 --> 33:09.238
Now, everyone, I want you
to take a cleansing breath

33:09.238 --> 33:12.041
before we take off.

33:15.378 --> 33:18.314
Great. Right, let's go.
Let's not be fucking late.
