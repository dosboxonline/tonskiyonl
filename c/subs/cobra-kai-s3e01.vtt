The moment we've all been waiting for.

Returning to defend his title,

00:19.310 --> 00:21.104
from Cobra Kai Karate,

00:21.646 --> 00:23.314
Miguel Diaz!

00:24.983 --> 00:25.984
Get ready…

00:26.985 --> 00:28.153
It's karate time!

00:33.074 --> 00:34.701
[referee] Face each other, bow.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.412
Face me, bow.

[reporter] It was two weeks ago today
at West Valley High,

01:12.906 --> 01:16.284
where what can only be described
as an all-out karate riot

01:16.367 --> 01:20.705
caught students and faculty off-guard,
sending shock waves through the Valley.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.874
We got enough to worry about.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.376
Now we got karate gangs in schools?

01:25.460 --> 01:28.797
There was a karate attack at the mall
a couple months back.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.882
I thought karate died out in the '80s.

01:30.965 --> 01:35.345
[Maria] Earlier today, students organized
a peaceful gathering of prayer and song.

Tonight, West Valley High
is holding a community meeting

01:49.150 --> 01:51.820
to answer questions
and help settle fears.

01:54.030 --> 01:58.451
He's still here. It's been four hours.
He's starting to creep out the customers.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.205
-All right. Tell him it's time to go.
-I gave him the bill two drinks ago.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.124
Now he's refusing to pay.

02:04.207 --> 02:08.169
Said he didn't order Coors Light,
he ordered Coors… Banquet.

[Maria on TV] Police are still looking
for Robby Keene, who ran away

02:33.111 --> 02:37.198
after kicking fellow student Miguel Diaz
off a second floor balcony,

02:37.282 --> 02:39.659
landing right here on this staircase.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.911
Keene has since been expelled.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.415
Diaz, meanwhile, remains in a coma
at West Valley General.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.791
His prognosis--

02:48.626 --> 02:51.045
Hey! I was watching that.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.174
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was your TV, homie.

I can't believe they had the gall
to suspend Sam for two weeks!

04:55.336 --> 04:58.006
I'll tell the board it's incompetent.
Heads will roll.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.383
They expelled the girl who started it.

-The dealership is a ghost town.
-It's not that bad.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.892
Yes, it is.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.478
Daniel, our name is poison.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.315
Turns out "Kicking the competition"
isn't a cute tagline

05:15.398 --> 05:18.651
when your student literally kicks
the competition over a railing.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.612

05:22.655 --> 05:25.658
I'm sorry. It's just…
I'm a little on edge right now, OK?

No.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.454
I'm sorry.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.414
I got us into this.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.252
And I promise, I'm gonna find a way
to get us out. OK? Come on.

please take your seats.

about student safety.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.514
-Where were the teachers?
-Yeah!

05:48.598 --> 05:52.060
You're frustrated.
But the NEA guidelines are quite clear.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.812
No teacher can get
between two students fighting.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.981
[man 1] That neckbeard teacher
attacked the kids!

05:57.065 --> 05:58.900
Mr. Stingray never worked here.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.068
Last we heard…

06:00.151 --> 06:04.614
Last we heard he's on probation and not
allowed within 500 feet of any child.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.241
How do we know this won't happen again?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.370
We have a new initiative called
"Hugs Not Hits."

06:10.453 --> 06:14.374
-Like DARE except it actually works.
-Your solution is to hug kids?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.168
Actually, they would hug each other.

06:17.251 --> 06:20.671
What Counselor Blatt is trying to say
is no more karate.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.382
Zero tolerance from now on.

06:22.465 --> 06:26.135
Wait. You don't need to turn this
into some kind of karate Footloose!

06:26.219 --> 06:28.054
Karate is not the problem!

06:28.137 --> 06:31.849
When I went to school here,
I was bullied, and karate saved me.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.726
[man 2] I heard you were the bully!

06:33.810 --> 06:35.686
[principal] Parents, please…
Can we please…

06:35.770 --> 06:38.940
We want to move on and handle this
with an appropriate response.

06:39.023 --> 06:42.485
Tell me how it's appropriate
that our daughter got suspended

06:42.568 --> 06:45.446
while a dimestore Freddy Krueger
nearly tore her face off.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.449

OK, no.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.868
-Excuse me?
-Who said that?

06:50.952 --> 06:53.079
Our daughter wasn't responsible.

06:53.162 --> 06:57.625
Don't get all high and mighty, LaRusso.
You taught them that Miyagi crap.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.794
It was your student who hurt Diaz.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
You reap what you sow.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.050
OK, no. Come on.
We gotta stay composed. Everyone, please.

08:08.112 --> 08:08.988
Yeah?

08:10.573 --> 08:14.243
Then why you here talkin'?
Shouldn't you be out looking for him?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.371
He made a mistake.
Shouldn't mean his life's over.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.624
Tell that to the kid he killed.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.920
Killed? What do you mean killed?

No. And the homeless shelters
were a dead end too, so--

13:34.271 --> 13:35.773
Would Robby steal a car?

13:36.565 --> 13:38.359
He did have the gate codes.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.444
But why would he steal that shitbox?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.031
Because we wouldn't notice.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.326
-Oh my God. We gotta call the police.
-No, no, not yet.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.494
What do you mean?

13:48.577 --> 13:51.205
We have GPS in all the cars
They can track him.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.917
If the cops find him running,
they'll throw the book at him.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.127
He's a dropout with a juvenile record.

13:57.211 --> 14:00.005
We find him first,
get him to turn himself in,

14:00.089 --> 14:01.924
we can make a better case.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.509
We could still help him.

14:03.592 --> 14:04.802
OK.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.304
All right,
find the VIN number, text me the GPS.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.269
You know, not for nothin'.
I'd have taken a Ferrari.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.645
Would you?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.147
[car stereo playing heavy metal]

14:28.409 --> 14:31.871
Miss your court date, I'll hunt you
like a dog in the street, bruh.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.082
We'll see about that, bruh!

14:57.104 --> 14:58.063
[yells]

15:04.153 --> 15:05.446
[Carmen] Miggy.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.739
It's mama.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.950
I love you so much, my baby.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.870
Please come back to us.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.205
We're right here.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.832
[grunting]

15:26.634 --> 15:27.968
[groans]

15:35.392 --> 15:37.269
[Carmen] I hope you can hear me, mijo.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.395
[nurse] He can.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.814
Just remind him you're here.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.108
Talk about things he loves.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.153
[in Spanish] Hey, Miguel.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.657
I think the Dodgers
are gonna make the playoffs.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.035
Even though I guess
they'll screw it up as usual.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.376
I love you.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.340
[in English] We love you, Miggy.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.218
[referee] That's a point.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.302
On one…

16:19.687 --> 16:20.980
Can I help you?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.899
-Yeah, I'm here to see Miguel Diaz.
-He's in the ICU.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.025
Are you family?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.443
No, but, uh--

16:26.527 --> 16:29.279
Only family,
doctors and patients in the ICU.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.156
Can't you make an exception?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.449
Those are the rules.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.453
Can't you, you know…

16:37.329 --> 16:38.497
break the rules?

16:40.457 --> 16:41.834
Come on, be a bad girl.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.506
Only family,
doctors and patients in the ICU.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.052
You're no fun.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.655
[phone beeping]

17:14.575 --> 17:15.659
Come on, Robby.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.912
Where are you?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.713
[phone continues beeping]

17:46.857 --> 17:47.983
[sighs]

17:49.276 --> 17:51.403
-Check those tires for me.
-[phone rings]

17:51.487 --> 17:53.322
-Hey. Did you find him?
-[Daniel] No.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.657
I found the GPS, but no van.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.118
He must've remembered
we track trade-ins.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.828
Now I'm back to square one.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.164
Anywhere nearby that he could've gone?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.709
There is one place.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.922
[Johnny] Hello.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.966
I'm Dr. L…

18:13.717 --> 18:14.551
Nguyen.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.554
I just need to get past that door.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.598
[toilet flushes]

18:21.642 --> 18:23.602
Oh. Hey, doc.

18:23.685 --> 18:24.686
I got this…

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
You're not a doctor.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.568
Sorry.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.905
[door opens, closes]

18:48.836 --> 18:49.795
[grunts]

18:57.052 --> 18:58.887
I think I need to see a doctor.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.308
[gentle music playing]

19:10.524 --> 19:12.526
[engine stops]

19:29.042 --> 19:30.043
Sam?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.337
Dad? What are you doing here?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.548
What are you doing here?
Is Robby with you?

19:34.631 --> 19:36.466
No. Have you heard from him?

19:36.550 --> 19:40.637
No. I was just out looking for him. I…
Wait, why aren't you in school?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.516
I thought I was ready.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.686
But then…

19:49.104 --> 19:50.772
everybody was staring at me.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.151
I just had to get out of there.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
So… I came here.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.991
Well, In-N-Out, and then here.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.336
I get it. [sighs]

20:13.253 --> 20:15.380
I've been in enough fights to know.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.301
It's different when you're a girl.

20:20.093 --> 20:23.096
I mean, even if you win,
you're not cool or tough.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.558
They think you're crazy.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.352
[sighs]

20:29.770 --> 20:33.440
[voice breaks] Then I think about
what Miguel and Robby are going through,

20:33.523 --> 20:34.566
and I just…

20:36.235 --> 20:37.611
I feel so guilty.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.988
It's not your fault.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.327
All this started
before you were even born.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.791
If not for me and Johnny,
there wouldn't have been a fight at all.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.209
This is my fault.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.969
I thought we were the good guys.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.138
We are.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.684
At least we try to be.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.812
That's what's most important.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.523
[sniffles]

21:14.606 --> 21:17.359
But there's one thing I do know for sure,
and that's…

21:17.442 --> 21:20.028
that you can't run away
from your problems.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.908
And I can't run away from mine.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.122
Come here.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.636
[doctor] We might need
to keep him overnight.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.596
Lab found blood in his urine.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.056
Oh, that? No biggie.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.019
I got in a fight last night.
Just a little, uh, jam in the lemonade.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.187
Usually goes away in two, three days.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.816
But this sucker's been bothering me a bit.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.069
[gasps]

22:02.446 --> 22:04.406
Bengay should take care of that, right?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.117
Uh, wait here.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.296
[ECG machine beeping]

22:27.763 --> 22:28.764
Hey, buddy.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.266
Sorry I haven't been here.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.394
Your mom hasn't wanted me around.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.230
Can't blame her.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.570
I thought I was helping you.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.241
You were learning so fast,
getting so strong.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.957
But I failed you.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.630
I'm so sorry.

23:04.674 --> 23:05.717
[both grunting]

23:11.807 --> 23:14.017
[Johnny] I don't know
if you can hear me, kid.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.019
But you got it in you to pull through.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.397
[yells]

23:18.980 --> 23:21.024
You just gotta keep fighting. [echoing]

23:26.196 --> 23:27.364
Never give up. [echoing]

23:33.954 --> 23:35.163
You can do this.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.499
-I know you can.
-Excuse me?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.293
Only family is allowed in here.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.629
Yeah, I was just leaving.

[shop bell jangles]

24:08.280 --> 24:09.239
Johnny?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.086
What the hell?

24:24.796 --> 24:25.630
We're closed.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.433
The dojo's going through some renovations.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.227
What do you think?

24:40.061 --> 24:41.188
Where's Johnny?

24:41.771 --> 24:43.023
He's not here right now.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.442
But he'll be back.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.363
It's a shame
what happened at the school.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.742
Such a tragedy.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.912
But I don't really blame Robby.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.665
'Cause you know what they say…

25:02.209 --> 25:04.544
there's no such thing as a bad student.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.713
[exhales heavily]

25:08.381 --> 25:12.302
It must really hurt to see the Miyagi name
dragged through the mud.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.640
Wish I could see the look
on the little bastard's face.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.188
That little bastard kicked your ass.

25:23.897 --> 25:24.981
More than once.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.736
You're lucky he taught me true karate.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.781
That's why I'm not gonna fight you.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.035
Oh, but you will.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.121
It's inevitable.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.083
But this time,

25:44.084 --> 25:45.752
Johnny and I will finish it.

25:46.795 --> 25:47.837
[chuckles]

25:48.964 --> 25:50.549
Once and for all.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.969
You're not gonna do anything.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.596
Not while I'm around.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.394
You know where to find me.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.856
[laughing]

26:10.694 --> 26:12.237
[guard] Good to go. Thank you.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.743
Did you see her?

26:21.538 --> 26:23.790
[whispering imperceptibly]

26:31.590 --> 26:34.217
You wanna say something,
say it to my face!

26:34.301 --> 26:35.385
[girl gasps]

26:37.012 --> 26:38.346
That's what I thought.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.650
John. Don't you answer your...

26:52.694 --> 26:54.529
Oh God, what happened to you?

26:54.613 --> 26:55.739
I bumped my head.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.074
What do you want?

26:59.367 --> 27:00.619
I went to your dojo,

27:01.244 --> 27:02.662
and saw your old sensei.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.248
What happened?
You said he was gone.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.335
I don't wanna get into it now.
I got a headache.

27:08.835 --> 27:09.961
I need some sleep.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.340
I got a lead on Robby.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.802
I've been trying to find him.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.015
But I thought…

27:22.641 --> 27:24.059
maybe you'd like to help.

27:28.021 --> 27:32.817
I don't wanna be here any more than you.
But I know we both want Robby to be safe.

27:35.236 --> 27:38.239
He's out there somewhere.
He doesn't have anyone to help him.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.707
[dramatic music playing]

27:47.791 --> 27:51.294
[Daniel] The reason these kids got
into trouble was because of us.

No mercy!

27:53.296 --> 27:54.547
[grunts]

27:59.594 --> 28:02.430

because of our issues.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.398
The only way to end this
is by working together.

28:13.024 --> 28:13.858
So?

28:16.194 --> 28:17.237
What do you say?

28:23.702 --> 28:24.661
