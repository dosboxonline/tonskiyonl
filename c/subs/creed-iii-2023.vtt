[announcer]
We're live, round one,
Cape Town, South Africa,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.750
as Adonis Creed
battles his old rival

07:48.950 --> 07:51.320
in what Creed has said
will be his final fight.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.930
Todd Grisham
alongside the champion,
Jessica McCaskill.

07:54.130 --> 07:57.110
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.110
Is Conlan looking this good
or Creed looking this bad?

08:00.310 --> 08:02.030
[McCaskill] If he doesn't
do something fast,

08:02.230 --> 08:03.730
he's going to end
his historic career

08:03.930 --> 08:05.420
with another loss to Conlan.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.000
- There we go.
- Put that jab in his face.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.490
Okay. Same Creed.
Ain't nothing changed.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.040
[Grisham]
Conlan stalking his prey,

08:15.240 --> 08:16.960
pushing Creed
towards the corner.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.130
[McCaskill]
You've got to wonder

08:18.330 --> 08:20.230
if the moment
is getting to Creed here.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.140
Conlan is banging away
with the right hand.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.970
[trainer] Look to your right.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.400
[Grisham] Seems to be
the same combination

08:28.600 --> 08:30.370
he's throwing over and over,
and Creed can't stop it.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.030
[grunting]

08:36.120 --> 08:37.770
[Grisham] Creed,
getting out of the corner.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.500
Good jab,
but Conlan not fazed at all.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.680
[trainer]
Keep that in his face.
Keep that jab out there.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.990
- [McCaskill] Big left
from Conlan.
- Get off that rope.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.600
[Grisham]
Oh, he's got him on the ropes.
Clean shots landing.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.310
Creed taking quite a beating.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.690
- [bell rings]
- And wow.
Conlan almost had him.

08:55.890 --> 08:58.780
Next round's
gonna hurt, champ.
Next round's gonna hurt.

09:00.110 --> 09:01.520
You okay, Donnie?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.870

You gotta work, baby.

beating you worse
than last time.

09:08.990 --> 09:10.660
Like, is something I miss
that's funny?

09:10.860 --> 09:13.750
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

09:13.950 --> 09:17.190
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.080
I ain't never been scared
of a little contact.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.330
I'm going out how I came in.

09:22.530 --> 09:25.420
Man, you're crazy, all right.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.770
Stop playing, knock him out.

09:27.970 --> 09:29.550
- How you feeling?
Looking great.
- [Ricky] I'm just warming up.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.770
He had a good run.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.260
But it's time
to take back what's ours.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.660
[sighs]

09:43.230 --> 09:44.880
[crowd cheering]

09:49.540 --> 09:51.490
[McCaskill] Creed's had
a remarkable career,

09:51.690 --> 09:54.010
but you wonder if Father Time
has finally caught up
with the champ.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.680
This is getting dangerous
for Creed.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.620
[Grisham] Ooh, the champ
finally lands one.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.580
[trainer]
Come on, Donnie. Work this.
Show him who's champ.

10:02.780 --> 10:04.630
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.

10:04.830 --> 10:05.770
One more time.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.480
[Grisham]
And down goes Conlan!
He goes down!

10:25.680 --> 10:28.170
What a moment!
And I don't think
he's gonna get up, Jessica.

10:39.210 --> 10:40.190
[Grisham]
And that's it, folks.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.410
- It's over.
- [crowd cheering]

10:41.610 --> 10:43.800
What a chess move
from Adonis Creed.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.930
[McCaskill] Just incredible.

10:45.130 --> 10:46.760
What a turn. What an ending.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.020
That's how you go out.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.370

Who would expect anything less
from Adonis Creed

10:52.570 --> 10:55.460
as he takes his final bow
on the world stage?

10:55.660 --> 10:56.640
What an exit.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.810
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.

10:59.010 --> 11:02.030
[Grisham] And that means
we've got a new, undisputed

11:02.230 --> 11:03.560

of the world

11:03.760 --> 11:05.730

13:35.040 --> 13:36.410
- Yeah, that's bad.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.200
Take that off
before it stains, D.

13:39.770 --> 13:40.930
Oh, I see
what you're trying to do.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.410
What's that?

13:42.610 --> 13:44.630
You're trying to get me naked.

13:44.830 --> 13:46.900
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely
not trying to do that
'cause I'm trying to work.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.160
I see what you were
trying to do.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.330
No, you can just own it.
It's okay.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.680
I know you just wanna
see all this.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.160
- [chuckling] No, no, no.
- Look at that.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.290
No.

13:54.490 --> 13:57.040
- Still hot? Still warm?
- [laughing]

13:57.240 --> 13:59.040
- Stop it.
I'm working, D. Please.
- [chuckles]

13:59.240 --> 14:00.820
I'm working too.
Listen,
I don't get a chance to--

14:01.020 --> 14:03.090
What are you working on?

14:03.290 --> 14:05.480
I don't get no alone time
with you no more
'cause you be hard at work.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.610
I know. Yeah.

14:06.810 --> 14:08.440
- You ain't got no time for me.
- I know.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.140
You ain't got time for--

14:10.340 --> 14:12.490
- I know,
but I don't have time now.
- So come on. You don't?

14:12.690 --> 14:14.410
- [laughing] No. No.
- Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.590
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.540
Don't you miss when...

14:21.740 --> 14:25.240
we used to... [inhales deeply]
...anywhere.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.540
- Any place?
- [chuckles] Mm-hmm.

14:27.740 --> 14:29.630
Mm-mmm. Okay.

14:29.830 --> 14:30.850
Okay, let's go.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.940
Okay, I just-- I have, like,
about 15 minutes

14:33.140 --> 14:34.900
- because I have to send
these stems.
- Fifteen.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.290
How about 12?

14:36.490 --> 14:37.830
[Bianca] All right.
Twelve will do.

14:40.790 --> 14:43.300
[foreboding music playing]

14:43.500 --> 14:45.660
[bus announcer]
<i>Next stop, Leimert Park.</i>

15:06.070 --> 15:08.210
- [boxers boxing]
- [indistinct talking]

15:09.640 --> 15:11.430
[person]
Body, head. Body, head.

15:12.820 --> 15:14.770
Efficiency over power, baby.
Give it to him.

15:14.970 --> 15:16.680
[grunting]

15:16.880 --> 15:18.330
[speaks Spanish]

15:18.530 --> 15:20.470
[trainer]
Technique. Technique, Felix.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.990
You can't just punch
your way through Drago.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.170
We got a plan, so stick to it.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.300
- Come on.
Make him work for it.
- [person] Let's go.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.830
It's not only about power.
It's timing, speed.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.180
- Shit, you're telling me?
Come on now.
- I know, I know.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.570
Keep drilling into him.

15:34.770 --> 15:36.740
[trainer]
Technique. Technique.

15:36.940 --> 15:37.880
- Time.
- [bell buzzes]

15:38.080 --> 15:39.830
Hey! Time!

15:40.030 --> 15:41.240
[person] Felix. Get over here.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.710
These guys are trash.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.710
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.

15:47.910 --> 15:50.190
It's hard.
You've chewed through
most of LA.

15:50.390 --> 15:53.020
You want me to pull back?
You know Drago
ain't taking it easy.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.940
[in Spanish] We're here
to train, we're here
to fight, aren't we?

15:56.140 --> 15:58.040
You taught me that
and that is what
we are going to do.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.330
Okay...

16:00.530 --> 16:02.470
[in English] Hey, Felix.
<i>Ven aqui.</i>

16:02.670 --> 16:04.730
What's up, champ?
You wanna help me
with some rounds?

16:04.930 --> 16:07.170
What, and mess up this suit?
I don't think so.

16:07.370 --> 16:09.390
I'm trying
to get you paid, Felix.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.000
We can't get you paid
if you keep knocking out

16:11.200 --> 16:12.610
all these sparring partners,
okay?

16:12.810 --> 16:14.780
You gotta be ready
to fight Drago in four weeks.

16:14.980 --> 16:17.050
You're the champ.
We know you got power.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.180
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.530
- It's about control and focus.
- You're right.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.670
Listen to Duke.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.750
Yes, sir.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.670
See? You play too much.

16:28.870 --> 16:30.190
- Listen to Duke.
- [Duke] Did you hear that?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.230
"Listen to Duke."

16:32.430 --> 16:35.060
Those three words.
Not "I love you."

16:35.260 --> 16:37.630
Not "take it easy."
None of that.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.590
"Listen to Duke."

16:39.790 --> 16:42.200
I understand
exactly what they're asking.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.770
Drago's got a bigger name,
that's true,
but Felix got the belt.

16:45.970 --> 16:48.210
His split's got to be bigger.

16:48.410 --> 16:50.530
I don't care
if they don't like it.
Tell Drago to call me.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.010
Hey,
let me call you right back.

16:54.660 --> 16:55.530
Hey, my man.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.090
Can I help you?

16:59.290 --> 17:01.870
- Let me get an autograph.
- No, I ain't signing
no autographs.

17:02.070 --> 17:02.760
Would you get off my car?

17:05.500 --> 17:06.760
Oh, homey.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.590
You don't remember me, huh?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.720
You come a long way
from bumming rides
from your mom.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.500
Dame.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.120
- [exhales] Boy, you had me.
- [Dame laughing]

17:22.080 --> 17:23.680
Damian.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.290
Yeah, just got back
to the hood.

17:25.490 --> 17:27.290
Stopped by the old gym,
but, uh...

17:27.490 --> 17:29.940
Yeah, we upgraded
a couple years ago, you know?

17:30.140 --> 17:30.910
I see.

17:34.180 --> 17:36.350
- Damn, it's, uh...
- It's been a minute.

17:37.530 --> 17:38.570
Been a minute.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.350
Hey, I don't wanna take up
your time or nothing, man.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.050
I just wanted to let you know
what's good.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.700
I'm around.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.580
If you wanna catch up,
you know,
you just let me know.

17:56.940 --> 17:57.940
Where you about to head now?

18:00.860 --> 18:01.990
Shit, back to the crib.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.600
You got time to get some grub?

18:05.820 --> 18:07.160
[Dame] Thank you.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.210
- Thank you.
- [server] Enjoy.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.660
I'm surprised
you still come here
and eat with the common folk.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.130
I mean, when I can.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.520
There's a lot of things
I used to do
that I can't do anymore.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.180
Busy living
that high life, huh?

18:28.380 --> 18:30.020
Yeah.
Guess it comes with the job.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.050
All right.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.530
Yo-- Easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.240
You know how long it's been
since I had this shit?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.160
How long?

18:41.030 --> 18:42.070
Eighteen years, bro.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.080
You've been down
this whole time?

18:48.120 --> 18:51.260
Had a few years tacked on,
but... yeah.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.820
[sighs]
Just got out last week.

18:56.130 --> 18:58.260
Well, congratulations on that.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.220
Thank you.

19:03.010 --> 19:04.360
Wrote you a few times.

19:06.050 --> 19:08.400
- You did?
Where'd you send 'em?
- Mama Creed's.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.740
She still up in Bel Air?

19:13.940 --> 19:15.240
Yeah, she's still there.
Same house.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.280
But I never got 'em.

19:24.510 --> 19:27.840
You know I watched
every one of your fights
in the pen.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.510
You finally
made it to Africa, huh?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.850
- You seen that?
- Saw that.

19:33.050 --> 19:36.240
Made me proud
how you ended your run.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.690
Look like you still remember
some of them moves
I taught you.

19:41.390 --> 19:42.740
You know what I remember?

19:44.660 --> 19:46.080
You knocking my ass out.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.490
[Dame laughing]

19:50.310 --> 19:51.790
You know what I remember?

19:53.580 --> 19:54.880
Helping your big ass back up.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.930
Remember that?

19:59.060 --> 20:00.720
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.

20:06.850 --> 20:07.770
You got work?

20:10.330 --> 20:12.550
I got plans. [chuckles]

20:13.990 --> 20:16.460
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my PO off my ass.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.600
[Adonis] Mm.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.160
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,

20:25.360 --> 20:28.700
if I can help at all,
just ask.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.310
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.540
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.580
I'm straight, bro.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.750
I'm good.
I got it all situated.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.840
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.420
Nah, I didn't mean it
like that. It was...

20:54.340 --> 20:55.380
Respect.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.720
So, what's the plan?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.130
Same program
last time you saw me.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.960
I wanna be champ.

21:11.790 --> 21:12.950
You still wanna box?

21:13.150 --> 21:14.880
Hey, I know I've been
away a long time.

21:17.620 --> 21:18.660
I kept myself in shape.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.220
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.410
Yeah. You...

21:24.370 --> 21:25.930
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.

21:27.150 --> 21:27.980
I'm ready.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.460
I still got gas in the tank.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.590
And I gotta get me that chain.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.990
Can't be "Diamond" Dame
looking bummy.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.950
- "Diamond" Dame.
- [Dame laughing]

21:41.380 --> 21:42.300
That's right.

21:49.960 --> 21:50.830
All right.

21:51.780 --> 21:52.870
Come by the gym.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.830
Get you set up with Duke.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.660
- For real?
- Yeah.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.230
For real.

22:05.410 --> 22:06.360
All right, then.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.280
Thank you.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.250
[ominous music playing]

22:28.080 --> 22:29.080
[grunts]

22:30.000 --> 22:31.430
Yo, yo, yo!

22:33.300 --> 22:34.680
[grunts]

22:34.880 --> 22:35.650
[gun cocks]

22:40.750 --> 22:43.650
- [Bianca laughs]
- What's so funny?

22:43.850 --> 22:46.170
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to convince your mama
to come live with us,

22:46.370 --> 22:48.610
so I can have
my own live-in braider.

22:48.810 --> 22:49.930
[Bianca and Adonis laugh]

22:51.100 --> 22:54.090
Yeah.
Careful what you wish for.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.500
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- [Mary-Anne chuckles]

22:56.890 --> 22:59.450
It's actually not a bad idea.

22:59.650 --> 23:01.620
And how you feeling, Mama?
You good?

23:01.820 --> 23:04.100
I'm good.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.190
- [Adonis] You sure?
- [Mary-Anne] Oh, yeah.

23:06.390 --> 23:07.760
Okay.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.560
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.070
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.770
- Mmm.
- I just got caught up.

23:16.970 --> 23:17.960
Mm-hmm.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.650
There. Look at that.

23:23.850 --> 23:27.050
Who's the real champ
in this family?

23:29.360 --> 23:30.170
You are.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.260
No. You.

23:32.460 --> 23:33.710
Go see for yourself.

23:36.930 --> 23:38.400
Thank you Grandma. I love you.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.840
You're welcome.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.180
I love you.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.320
Hey.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.590
No TV.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.940
[Mary-Anne snorts]

23:47.600 --> 23:49.500
Fine. I love you.

23:49.700 --> 23:53.080
[laughing] You're gonna have
your hands full with that one.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.460
We already do.

23:55.660 --> 23:58.430
- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.200
She is.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.070
- You're the worst.
- Oh, come on, Mama.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.440
- You're the worst.
- [chuckles] Stop...
You don't mean it.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.920
- Here, Ma.
- Thank you.

24:07.830 --> 24:09.600
B, think that's a good idea?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.210
[Bianca] Baby, not tonight.

24:11.410 --> 24:12.650
[Adonis] But we talked
about this.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.800
- [Bianca] One thing at a time.
- [Adonis] Okay.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.620
Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?

24:23.820 --> 24:25.500
And just so we're straight

24:26.630 --> 24:28.840
and everybody knows,

24:29.040 --> 24:30.460
I am not leaving my house.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.450
Understood?

24:32.650 --> 24:34.110
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.

24:34.310 --> 24:36.670
- [Bianca] Okay.
- [Mary-Anne] Okay.

24:36.870 --> 24:38.460
And I really am fine.

24:38.660 --> 24:41.160
I promise you,
I am not gonna have
another stroke tonight.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.040
Okay?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.940
Have it tomorrow night.

24:45.140 --> 24:47.510
- Mom. That's...
- [Bianca and Mary-Anne laugh]

24:47.710 --> 24:48.770
That's not funny.

24:48.970 --> 24:50.170
[Bianca chuckling]
It's a little funny.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.040
And you're not helping.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.300
You know
that we're worried about you.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.690
- That's it.
We can leave it now.
- I...

24:55.890 --> 24:57.530
And we wanna be careful
after the last one.

24:58.140 --> 24:59.490
I am fine.

25:00.410 --> 25:01.190
Okay?

25:04.240 --> 25:06.140
But what about you?

25:06.340 --> 25:07.400
What's up with you?

25:07.600 --> 25:09.200
Yeah. Where were you, D?

25:10.460 --> 25:12.070
Just ran into
this guy named Dame.

25:13.460 --> 25:14.510
Damian.

25:16.990 --> 25:18.370
Who's he?

25:18.570 --> 25:19.430
[grunting]

25:24.080 --> 25:27.090
Think you might've
checked with me?
This ain't no damn charity.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.950
And homey older than you.

25:31.150 --> 25:33.690
I'm just trying
to give him a break.
Isn't that what we do anyway?

25:33.890 --> 25:36.390
No! This ain't the YMCA.

25:36.590 --> 25:37.950
Look around, Duke.

25:38.150 --> 25:39.660
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?

25:41.010 --> 25:43.440
All I'm saying is,
let him spar.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.830
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.

25:47.030 --> 25:49.010
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring
with Felix.

25:49.210 --> 25:50.330
I know what you doin', Donnie.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.500
You don't owe this dude shit.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.290
Nothing.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.120
But let's spar.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
Let's do it.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.630
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.300
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.650
[Adonis] Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.440
- Huh?
- We on.

26:20.310 --> 26:21.490
Lot of young cats in here.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.710
Young man's game.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.670
Don't worry,
Duke's gonna take care of you.

26:28.970 --> 26:30.400
[Dame] We back to ground zero.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.150
Champs gotta start somewhere,
right?

26:38.810 --> 26:40.620
[Duke] All right.

26:40.820 --> 26:44.690
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.340
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.900
You got this.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.960
[Duke] Felix, stay focused.
Work on timing.
That's all we need.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.140
[tense music playing]

27:06.530 --> 27:07.400
[thud]

27:10.060 --> 27:14.240
Why's this kid picking on her?

27:14.980 --> 27:16.020
Well, I'm just asking.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.110
Sign.

27:20.370 --> 27:21.320
I'm sorry.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.580
I think...

27:22.780 --> 27:26.240
She probably wants
to get some attention -

27:26.440 --> 27:29.120
Hold on. Why is my daughter
in trouble and not her?

27:30.030 --> 27:32.520
She can't protect herself?

27:34.300 --> 27:37.330
Obviously we're concerned
about Amara.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.600
Feeling comfortable here
is important.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.510
Of course.

27:41.710 --> 27:45.570
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.300
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.700
Look, we love Amara.

27:53.900 --> 27:57.700
She's an academically
exceptional child...

27:57.900 --> 27:58.830
She's thriving.

27:59.030 --> 28:02.410
She just... fights.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.540
So, you wanna
teach her how to fight?
That's your advice?

28:07.740 --> 28:09.710
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

28:09.910 --> 28:12.190
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait. [sighs]

28:12.390 --> 28:16.070
What does that mean,
"at a deaf school like that,"
like they're not still kids?

28:16.270 --> 28:17.720
I mean,
what did you expect, Adonis?

28:17.920 --> 28:19.460
[Adonis] Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

28:19.660 --> 28:20.940
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that

28:21.140 --> 28:22.510
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

28:22.710 --> 28:24.120
I'm just saying
what that means to me

28:24.320 --> 28:25.950
is different
than what it means to you.

28:26.150 --> 28:29.600
What if she's someplace
she's supposed to be safe,
and she's not?

28:29.800 --> 28:31.230
She won't know
how to protect herself.

28:32.490 --> 28:33.400
Where's that coming from?

28:35.010 --> 28:37.450
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.480
Okay.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.530
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

28:42.730 --> 28:43.920
it's actually
our responsibility

28:44.120 --> 28:46.100
to teach her
how to assess her emotions.

28:46.300 --> 28:49.140
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

28:49.340 --> 28:50.970
and start talking
about her feelings?

28:51.170 --> 28:52.100
That's not real life.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.800
Okay, what do you
want her to do?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.760
You want her
to never talk about
her feelings to anyone?

28:55.960 --> 29:00.550
Not even to us,
and all she can do
about them is to hit somebody?

29:00.750 --> 29:02.550
Look,
I know that you think that
that has worked for you,

29:02.750 --> 29:04.420
but now that you don't have
an outlet anymore,

29:04.620 --> 29:06.900
you should think about
maybe talking
about how you feel.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.080
If not to me, to somebody.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.920
Or, I don't know, D.
Get a hobby.

29:12.220 --> 29:13.690
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?

29:13.890 --> 29:15.740
Yeah, you.

29:15.940 --> 29:17.690
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start
laying tracks with you.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.740
That's not funny, D.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.920
Look,
I know that you think that
you are protecting her, baby,

29:24.120 --> 29:27.840
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,
not just how to do it.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.320
And the only solution
to every problem
is not a punch in the face.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.450
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.

29:32.650 --> 29:33.330
[doorbell ringing]

29:37.510 --> 29:39.250
[Adonis] All right,
let's just have a good time.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.760
Okay,
I see you made it all right.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.420
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"Where the Black family
live at?"

29:46.620 --> 29:47.940
[all chuckling]

29:48.140 --> 29:49.680
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.900
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

29:51.100 --> 29:53.030
There's other ones around.

29:53.230 --> 29:54.640
I ain't see none. Here you go.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.080
Thank you.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.950
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.430
- You never bought me
no flowers.
- What, you want a kiss?

30:00.630 --> 30:03.220
- Nah. I'm okay.
No, no, it's all right.
- Come here.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.830
- Hey, y'all got
a beautiful home.
- [Bianca] Thank you.

30:06.030 --> 30:09.090
Hey... dinner time.

30:09.290 --> 30:10.460
[Dame] You got
the see-through floors?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.280
Oh.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.550
Whoa. All right.

30:17.550 --> 30:18.720
Amara.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.510
- Amara?
- [Adonis] Mm-hmm.

30:22.510 --> 30:25.560
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.080
Nice to meet you.

30:30.430 --> 30:32.160
[Bianca] She says, "You too."
[chuckles]

30:32.360 --> 30:33.250
Ah, hell yeah.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.570
Need water?

30:39.350 --> 30:40.440
Thank you again.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.000
Thank you very much.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.830
[Dame] Dawg,
I still can't get over this.

30:45.030 --> 30:47.310
This square
got him a whole mansion.
[chuckles]

30:47.510 --> 30:50.270
Married a--
a genuine rock star.

30:50.470 --> 30:51.760
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.

30:52.850 --> 30:54.920
How many gold records you got?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.840
- I have a few. [chuckles]
- [Adonis] She bein' modest.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.840
She bein' real modest.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.540
No, but it's mostly
artists I produce,
but, yeah, I got some.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.020
- And she produces?
- She does.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.370
Donnie. You punching up.

31:08.570 --> 31:11.160
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?

31:11.360 --> 31:13.720
I don't really
perform like that these days.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.940
Yeah, I took a break,
'cause I was...

31:16.140 --> 31:18.950
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

31:19.150 --> 31:21.340
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve
what I've got left,

31:21.540 --> 31:23.790
so, I'm producing.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.650
Yeah.

31:26.850 --> 31:28.360
Not any time soon. [chuckles]

31:30.620 --> 31:33.570
Still hard
to give that part up, though.
Right?

31:33.770 --> 31:37.180
Yeah. It's not
the only thing I love,
but it takes work.

31:37.380 --> 31:38.700
- [Adonis]
It's an adjustment...
- [Bianca] Mm-hmm.

31:38.900 --> 31:39.880
[Adonis] ...for the both of us.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.970
So, how long
have you known each other?

31:43.170 --> 31:45.320
- [sighs] I mean...
- We go back. Way back.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.500
We was like...
We was like brothers.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.510
Shared a room for two years
at the Jeff.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.940
Yeah, something like that.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.070
You know how it went.
He went off
and got all Hollywood.

31:57.270 --> 31:58.510
The Jeff, right.

31:58.710 --> 31:59.780
Yeah, the group home.

32:01.650 --> 32:03.000
You remember them bedbugs?

32:05.050 --> 32:06.340
I try to forget 'em.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.660
[chuckling] Yeah.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.320
I can't forget them bugs.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.390
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- [Adonis] Okay.

32:16.590 --> 32:19.140
- You two stay, catch up.
- [Adonis] Okay.

32:19.340 --> 32:21.140
Oh, invite him
to the label party.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.570
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.790
I heard that. I'm invited
to the label party.

32:24.990 --> 32:26.190
[laughing]

32:26.390 --> 32:27.320
- You're invited.
- [Dame] Thank you.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.760
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.030
- Yeah, no doubt.
My pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.210
[Dame] I can't believe
you moved back out here
to the boonies.

32:44.410 --> 32:46.560
You used to love
coming out to the hood.
Now you all...

32:46.760 --> 32:48.640
What?

32:48.840 --> 32:50.780
- Domesticated and shit.
- Ah, come on, man.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.870
- [Dame chuckles]
- See what happens
when you get married.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.690
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?

32:54.890 --> 32:57.060
- The women run this household.
I just live here.
- [Dame chuckles]

32:58.710 --> 33:01.370
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

33:02.060 --> 33:03.110
It's crazy.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.240
Pour up.

33:19.340 --> 33:21.730
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.740
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.

33:33.830 --> 33:36.690
You saying that
like I got soft
or something, like...

33:36.890 --> 33:38.690
- Like I lost this
sneak-attack.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:38.890 --> 33:40.960
Okay, I see.
The champ's still got
some pepper in him.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.890
All I'm saying is,
I left boxing,
but boxing didn't leave me.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.190
See,
that's what I'm saying, bro.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.660
I mean, look,
I know you got a ship to run,
and whatnot,

33:52.860 --> 33:53.970
but I ain't keep
my stuff together

33:54.170 --> 33:55.770
just to be some punching bag
for some chump.

33:56.510 --> 33:57.580
You feel me?

33:57.780 --> 33:59.820
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

34:01.430 --> 34:03.040
He got it the hard way.
He earned it.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.170
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.220
Maybe I ain't
make myself clear.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.790
I want a title shot.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.650
Dame...

34:19.850 --> 34:22.040
[chuckles] I don't know
what you think,
but it don't work like that.

34:22.240 --> 34:25.090
Felix so cold,
what he got to lose?
What you got to lose?

34:25.290 --> 34:27.310
You think I can snap
my fingers and make you
a contender overnight?

34:27.510 --> 34:28.670
Ain't that
what happened to you?

34:29.800 --> 34:30.590
[scoffs]

34:38.380 --> 34:39.420
It's like this, bro.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
I respect you...

34:45.340 --> 34:47.280
but my clock tickin'.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.900
It's now or never for me.

34:50.100 --> 34:52.690
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.

34:54.220 --> 34:56.350
But, man,
what you asking me, it's...

34:58.400 --> 34:59.350
it's kinda impossible.

35:04.050 --> 35:05.710
You don't know
what it's like, bro.

35:08.670 --> 35:09.750
All that time in them...

35:11.670 --> 35:12.710
in them walls.

35:17.810 --> 35:18.850
Impossible?

35:21.770 --> 35:22.810
They take your name.

35:23.640 --> 35:24.990
And they give you a number.

35:28.080 --> 35:28.860
That's how it start.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.470
I was the best, though.

35:34.170 --> 35:35.220
Yeah, you were.

35:36.170 --> 35:37.260
I was, bro.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.700
But I never got a chance
to prove that.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.130
Look,
all I'm saying, bro, if--

35:45.330 --> 35:49.490
If Apollo Creed
could take a chance
on some underdog...

35:51.230 --> 35:52.280
why can't you?

36:05.420 --> 36:06.460
Did you sleep okay?

36:08.730 --> 36:10.240
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.730
[Bianca] You were
grinding your teeth.

36:14.430 --> 36:15.910
How was the rest
of last night?

36:16.730 --> 36:18.460
[Adonis] Mm...

Damian ain't a boxer.

He's fighting the world

to hurt people.

No, I don't like it.
I think it'd be a circus.

48:02.060 --> 48:05.520
What he means is
he's gonna put on a show.
Okay?

48:05.720 --> 48:07.520
We gotta play the cards
that we're dealt.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.130

I can promise you that.

59:11.980 --> 59:13.710
Listen, pain is temporary.

59:13.910 --> 59:15.970
- Say it back to me.
Pain is temporary.
- Pain is temporary.

59:16.170 --> 59:18.490
He a bum! Okay?
And you the champ, right?

59:18.690 --> 59:20.410
I'm the champ.

59:20.610 --> 59:21.730
Let's go, champ.
Keep your hands up.
Stay off them ropes.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.550
Bring it in.

59:27.750 --> 59:30.160
- [coach] That's good.
Let's go. <i>Vamos.</i>
- [Duke] Come on.

59:30.360 --> 59:31.550
- [bell rings]
- [commentator 2]
Two rounds down,

59:31.750 --> 59:34.700
but it's clearly not the fight
any of us expected.

59:35.570 --> 59:36.820
Stay in it, <i>mijo.</i>

59:37.020 --> 59:38.220
[commentator 1]
Another shot to that left arm.

59:42.140 --> 59:44.610
Things are starting
to get very ugly.

59:44.810 --> 59:47.000
- Chavez is in
some serious trouble.
- [referee] Hands free. Stop!

59:47.200 --> 59:48.960
- I gotta take her, D, okay?
- Okay.

59:49.160 --> 59:50.220
We gotta go.

59:50.420 --> 59:51.960
There's no such thing
as defeat. Let's go.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.180
[commentator 2]
This is dangerous.

59:53.380 --> 59:54.830
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...

59:55.030 --> 59:57.010
- Move. Move!
- ...and Chavez
is getting demolished.

59:57.210 --> 59:58.290
[speaking Spanish]

1:00:06.380 --> 1:00:10.890
[commentator 2]
Oh, what a shot by Anderson.
Down goes Chavez.

1:00:11.090 --> 1:00:14.420
<i>Chavez is not getting back up.</i>

1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:16.550
[commentator 1]
Oh, no.
You don't wanna see that.

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.340
Chavez is down

1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:20.950
- and appears
to be badly hurt.
- No, no, no.

1:00:21.150 --> 1:00:22.780
- [Laura] Felix!
- [bell dinging]

1:00:22.980 --> 1:00:24.690
- [announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen...
- [coach speaking Spanish]

1:00:24.890 --> 1:00:26.610
- [Laura] <i>¿Que paso?</i>
- ...our referee in charge,

1:00:26.810 --> 1:00:28.820
- Russell Mora,
stops the contest.
- [Adonis] Call the paramedics!

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:31.310
- [announcer]
He is the winner...
- Doc, is he gonna be okay?

1:00:31.510 --> 1:00:33.090
...by way
of spectacular knockout

1:00:33.290 --> 1:00:37.220
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:41.180
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

1:00:41.380 --> 1:00:44.550
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1:00:45.550 --> 1:00:47.380
Right? What?

1:01:03.090 --> 1:01:04.130
[sighs]

1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:11.180
[grunts]

1:01:20.370 --> 1:01:22.140
All right, Duke.
We gotta make this right.

1:01:22.340 --> 1:01:24.310
- Whatever I can do...
- No.
I told you, dawg, already.

1:01:24.510 --> 1:01:26.270
Ain't no making nothing right.
Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1:01:26.470 --> 1:01:27.880
- I can fix it.
- No!

1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:29.890
- [siren wailing]
- You can't.

1:01:30.090 --> 1:01:32.810
You stay away from the gym.
You do that.
And stay away for a while.

1:01:47.740 --> 1:01:48.740
[cell phone beeps]

1:01:57.230 --> 1:01:58.230
[door closes]

1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:00.670
[Mary-Anne sighs]

1:02:02.630 --> 1:02:04.090
Hey, Ma.

1:02:04.290 --> 1:02:05.620
[Mary-Anne] How's Felix?

1:02:05.820 --> 1:02:06.810
[washing hands]

1:02:08.070 --> 1:02:09.330
He's still at the hospital.

1:02:10.070 --> 1:02:11.330
He's stable.

1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:15.100
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.

1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:16.290
Mm-hmm.

1:02:16.950 --> 1:02:18.250
May be smart.

1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:21.340
[Adonis grunts, sighs]

1:02:23.820 --> 1:02:25.000
What's all this?

1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:29.480
They're from Damian.

1:02:35.090 --> 1:02:37.140
[somber music playing]

1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:46.140
You kept these from me?

1:02:46.340 --> 1:02:48.020
To help you move on,
yes, I did.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:54.290
Mama, how could you?

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.580
I was trying to protect you.

1:02:58.780 --> 1:02:59.980
Protect me from what?

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:01.890
Damian was my brother.

1:03:02.090 --> 1:03:03.850
No, Donnie.

1:03:04.050 --> 1:03:06.630
Not in that facility
where you were caged
like an animal.

1:03:06.830 --> 1:03:08.850
Did you think
that I was gonna
let you go back to that?

1:03:09.050 --> 1:03:11.520
You made him think
I abandoned him.

1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:14.860
Do you know
what we went through?

1:03:15.060 --> 1:03:16.880
I know who that man was
the two of you beat up.

1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:19.970
You know Leon?

1:03:22.140 --> 1:03:23.270
[sighs]

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:28.180
[sniffles] Yeah.

1:03:28.380 --> 1:03:32.010
Then you know Damian
had my back before
you even knew who I was.

1:03:32.210 --> 1:03:34.270
Dame treated me
more like family
than your two kids

1:03:34.470 --> 1:03:35.400
ever did in this house.

1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:37.530
And you took that
away from me.

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:39.550
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:44.080
You're absolutely right.

1:03:46.690 --> 1:03:47.780
None of it.

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:51.130
You hit hard, Donnie.

1:03:52.170 --> 1:03:54.390
And you can't see.

1:03:57.310 --> 1:03:59.530
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:04.310
But that's not
what he's doing now.

1:04:11.150 --> 1:04:13.020
[ominous music playing]

1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:24.330
[exhales shakily]

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:37.960
[hip-hop music
playing on speakers]

1:04:38.570 --> 1:04:39.550
Excuse me.

1:04:39.750 --> 1:04:42.250
Yo, Dame. Dame.

1:04:42.450 --> 1:04:44.080
- Hey, man.
- Get your hands off me.

1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:45.910
Get your hands off me!

1:04:46.110 --> 1:04:46.910
[crowd exclaiming]

1:04:47.110 --> 1:04:47.870
[person] Hold up.

1:04:48.070 --> 1:04:49.010
[music stops]

1:04:50.010 --> 1:04:51.230
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:53.620
Give me that.

1:04:59.020 --> 1:05:00.200
That's what we on?

1:05:02.020 --> 1:05:04.360
What's up, Donnie?
You all right?
You look tidy, bro.

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.290
Man. Nah, nah,
you tell me, bro.

1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:09.600
You've been playing me
this whole time.

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:12.890
Guess you did
get them letters, huh?

1:05:13.090 --> 1:05:14.040
Why'd you lie to me?

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.720
I vouched for you.

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:19.950
I brought you
into my home, bro.
You met my family.

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:24.160
I put money up for you.

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:26.030
- Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.
- All right. That's enough.

1:05:26.230 --> 1:05:28.620
You feel me? [laughing]

1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:32.050
You put the gloves
on my hands?

1:05:33.230 --> 1:05:34.190
Oh, homey. [chuckles]

1:05:35.010 --> 1:05:36.350
You must be punchy.

1:05:36.550 --> 1:05:38.830
[Dame, crowd laughing]

1:05:39.030 --> 1:05:42.360
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:44.880
Get your shit
and get out the gym.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:47.620
Oh, Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1:05:47.820 --> 1:05:48.680
You think I need you?

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:53.190
No. When I got locked up,
I needed you.

1:05:53.390 --> 1:05:56.900
[chuckling] When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.

1:05:58.730 --> 1:06:00.040
But look around, bro.

1:06:01.870 --> 1:06:04.160
- I'm the champ! [laughing]
- [crowd] Yeah!

1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:07.160
And I don't need you
for nothing or... or nothing.

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:08.350
[laughing]

1:06:10.740 --> 1:06:11.880
Who alone now?

1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:19.870
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1:06:20.070 --> 1:06:21.790
Run away.
That's the one thing
you still good at,

1:06:21.990 --> 1:06:23.530
Baby Creed.

1:06:23.730 --> 1:06:24.670
[crowd laughing]

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:26.850
[sighs]

1:06:28.980 --> 1:06:30.020
What was that?

1:06:31.590 --> 1:06:32.770
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?

1:06:35.070 --> 1:06:36.250
You mad?

1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:39.590
Try spending
half your life in a cell

1:06:39.790 --> 1:06:41.690
watching somebody else
live your life.

1:06:43.730 --> 1:06:45.390
You turned your back on me,
homey.

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:49.960
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:51.550
[chuckles]

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:53.030
Hey, come here.

1:06:53.230 --> 1:06:54.270
Remember this?

1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.040
This title?

1:06:57.240 --> 1:06:59.520
All this? [chuckles]

1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:01.710
Hey, I'm just getting started,
little brother.

1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.750
I'm coming for it all.

1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:07.710
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:09.720
Are you threatening me?

1:07:14.810 --> 1:07:16.100
[Adonis grunts]

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:17.640
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1:07:18.900 --> 1:07:20.190
Just promises here, homey.

1:07:20.390 --> 1:07:22.930
[tense music playing]

1:07:23.130 --> 1:07:24.240
Come here. Let's see.

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:25.730
- Get your hands off me.
- Oh, you all right.

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:31.610
Yeah.

1:07:32.610 --> 1:07:33.780
Help yourself up for once.

1:07:35.180 --> 1:07:36.220
See how it feel.

1:07:44.580 --> 1:07:46.320
[tense music intensifies]

1:07:53.110 --> 1:07:54.240
Aloha!

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:05.020
[sighs]

1:08:05.220 --> 1:08:06.250
[Bianca]
Where were you all night?

1:08:09.250 --> 1:08:12.080
You didn't get
any of my calls then,
or this morning?

1:08:17.180 --> 1:08:18.730
What happened to your eye?

1:08:18.930 --> 1:08:19.660
Nothing.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.230
Are you okay?

1:08:26.710 --> 1:08:28.880
[scoffs] Not today.
I ain't got time
for a therapy session.

1:08:30.970 --> 1:08:33.090
Okay. Well, then
what do you have time for?

1:08:33.290 --> 1:08:35.530
Let me know.

1:08:35.730 --> 1:08:38.050
Because I have been trying
to talk to you for
a really long time, Donnie.

1:08:38.250 --> 1:08:39.200
All right?

1:08:41.070 --> 1:08:43.240
Please, can you tell me
what is going on.

1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.710
Is it me?

1:08:45.910 --> 1:08:48.540
No.
It's nothing to do with you.

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:49.690
[Bianca sighs]

1:08:56.820 --> 1:08:57.870
Is it about Leon?

1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:02.520
What? Who told you that?

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:05.880
Dame.

1:09:07.830 --> 1:09:09.710
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?

1:09:11.450 --> 1:09:13.610
[Bianca sighs]

1:09:13.810 --> 1:09:16.570
D, you have got to
open up at some point.

1:09:16.770 --> 1:09:19.090
I don't know what else
to tell you.
I need to understand.

1:09:19.290 --> 1:09:21.230
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?

1:09:21.430 --> 1:09:22.790
Some sad story?

1:09:22.990 --> 1:09:24.880
You're trying
to feel sorry for me
or something?

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.930
I don't wanna
feel sorry for you!
I wanna understand you!

1:09:27.130 --> 1:09:29.280
I wanna know
what is going on with you
in my house!

1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:32.190
There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna
talk about anything!

1:09:32.390 --> 1:09:34.150
I've been trying to forget it!

1:09:34.350 --> 1:09:37.420
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!

1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:39.300
I'm not talking
about that shit no more.

1:09:45.050 --> 1:09:45.860
[Bianca sighs]

1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:47.700
[somber music playing]

1:09:49.310 --> 1:09:51.820
You figure out your shit, D.

1:09:52.020 --> 1:09:56.100
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1:09:57.970 --> 1:09:59.190
Do you understand?

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:01.800
[softly] yeah.

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:10.330
I love you.

1:10:55.380 --> 1:10:57.380
[Leon] <i>Hey, what y'all doing</i>
<i>in there?</i>

1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.240
Dame! Adonis!

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:02.110
- [young Adonis] Stop!
- [Leon] Come on! Fight me!

1:11:02.310 --> 1:11:03.200
[young Adonis] <i>Leon, I'm sorry!</i>

1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:04.650
[Leon]
<i>Y'all are so tough, huh?</i>

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:20.430
- [young Adonis] <i>Leon?</i>
- [Leon] <i>Huh?</i>

1:11:20.630 --> 1:11:22.190
[young Adonis]
<i>Don't remember me, do you?</i>

1:11:31.330 --> 1:11:33.140
Hey, get off him!

1:11:33.340 --> 1:11:34.630
Yeah, you know what it is,
homey.

1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:39.420
[sirens blaring]

1:11:42.900 --> 1:11:44.150
- [young Adonis] Dame!
- Step away from the gun.

1:11:44.350 --> 1:11:45.720
- Step away from the gun.
- It's down.

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:46.910
It's down! It's down.

1:11:48.780 --> 1:11:50.290
[breathes deeply]

1:11:50.490 --> 1:11:52.830
[cell phone rings, buzzes]

1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:58.690
- Hey, Mama.
- [Bianca] <i>Adonis, baby.</i>

1:11:58.890 --> 1:12:00.470
<i>You gotta get here right away.</i>

1:12:00.670 --> 1:12:02.950
<i>Mama had another stroke.</i>

1:12:03.150 --> 1:12:05.960
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>multiple organ failures.</i>

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.830
<i>I don't know, D.</i>
<i>I think it's...</i>[sobs]

1:12:09.030 --> 1:12:11.020
<i>I think it might be time</i>
<i>to say goodbye.</i>

1:12:13.190 --> 1:12:15.020
[inhales sharply] Mama?

1:12:19.290 --> 1:12:20.800
Mom, I'm sorry.

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.860
- What?
- I didn't mean it.

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:25.060
I didn't mean it. [sniffles]

1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:26.380
Mm-mmm.

1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:30.120
- [Adonis mumbles]
- The day I met you.

1:12:31.470 --> 1:12:33.870
Ooh, that face.

1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:38.990
Mmm. You were so mad.

1:12:39.190 --> 1:12:45.130
Gonna knock everybody out,
one by one. [chuckles]

1:12:45.330 --> 1:12:46.880
Just like your father.

1:12:49.450 --> 1:12:52.410
That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?

1:12:53.410 --> 1:12:55.000
Yeah.

1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:59.110
But you-- you don't have
to do that.

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:02.900
You can find another way.

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:05.930
Yeah.

1:13:06.130 --> 1:13:07.580
[Adonis sniffles]

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:09.860
Yeah, another way.

1:13:10.730 --> 1:13:12.170
Another way.

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:15.160
I was angry.

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:19.170
I was so angry
when you left me, Apollo.

1:13:24.090 --> 1:13:27.750
Why did you leave me alone?

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:33.060
Adonis.

1:13:34.450 --> 1:13:36.410
That's his name.

1:13:37.670 --> 1:13:38.570
[voice shaking]
I'm right here.

1:13:38.770 --> 1:13:41.540
He saved me, Apollo.

1:13:43.980 --> 1:13:47.320
He helped me to forgive you.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.160
Mom, I'm sorry.

1:13:50.900 --> 1:13:52.380
[crying]
Just tell me what to do.

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:56.690
[sniffles] Okay?

1:13:57.780 --> 1:13:59.560
[whispers] Adonis.

1:14:01.650 --> 1:14:02.960
Adoni--

1:14:06.130 --> 1:14:08.310
[sorrowful music playing]

1:15:35.090 --> 1:15:36.220
I'm sorry.

1:15:39.270 --> 1:15:40.100
I know.

1:15:42.970 --> 1:15:44.130
It's okay.

1:15:44.330 --> 1:15:45.270
No, it's not.

1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:47.930
It's just...

1:15:48.970 --> 1:15:50.110
when Dame came back...

1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:56.850
all this shit came back too.

1:15:58.110 --> 1:15:59.110
I didn't know
how to handle it.

1:16:00.900 --> 1:16:02.980
But you were always
really good at that.

1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:05.630
Feelings.
It comes easy to you.

1:16:05.830 --> 1:16:07.430
Doesn't come easy to me.

1:16:08.860 --> 1:16:09.910
Doesn't.

1:16:11.690 --> 1:16:14.640
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:17.990
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

1:16:18.190 --> 1:16:19.730
You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing

1:16:19.930 --> 1:16:21.690
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.

1:16:21.890 --> 1:16:23.310
I could talk to her.

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:25.100
Now she's gone.

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:32.790
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1:16:32.990 --> 1:16:35.760
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined
that they would.

1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:39.850
And that still hurts me.

1:16:42.070 --> 1:16:43.120
A lot.

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:49.240
But I just made a choice
to try to move on

1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:51.340
and be happy
about what I do have.

1:16:56.390 --> 1:16:58.170
But it's not easy. [chuckles]

1:17:01.570 --> 1:17:02.870
I just try.

1:17:18.590 --> 1:17:19.670
Leon...

1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:23.760
was the dad at the group home

1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:26.420
where I lived with Dame.

1:17:30.550 --> 1:17:32.510
I'm not saying me
and Dame were angels.

1:17:34.340 --> 1:17:36.460
Okay? But...

1:17:36.660 --> 1:17:39.390
no kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:41.520
You feel me?

1:17:43.390 --> 1:17:46.700
That night
at the liquor store,
I saw Leon.

1:17:50.790 --> 1:17:51.920
And I snapped.

1:17:56.230 --> 1:17:57.450
And I hit him.

1:18:00.370 --> 1:18:01.670
I kept hitting him.

1:18:05.330 --> 1:18:07.030
And his boys jumped on me.

1:18:09.380 --> 1:18:10.460
So Dame pulled a gun.

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:13.210
Cops pulled up.

1:18:14.690 --> 1:18:15.770
We tried to run.

1:18:16.950 --> 1:18:19.600
Dame got caught. I got away.

1:18:22.740 --> 1:18:24.170
I ran.

1:18:25.610 --> 1:18:26.780
You were a kid.

1:18:28.570 --> 1:18:31.990
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.

1:18:32.190 --> 1:18:35.130
And Dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.

1:18:35.330 --> 1:18:37.270
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:40.800
I never called.

1:18:41.620 --> 1:18:42.710
I didn't write.

1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.230
[stammers]

1:18:46.430 --> 1:18:51.420
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1:18:52.290 --> 1:18:53.510
You know, just...

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:57.450
act like it never happened.

1:18:57.650 --> 1:19:00.380
But that doesn't
make you responsible
for how his life turned out.

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:06.210
You are a good man, Adonis.

1:19:06.950 --> 1:19:09.340
I don't know anymore.

1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:11.550
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,

1:19:11.750 --> 1:19:16.090
so that you can begin
to believe that you deserve
the life that you have earned.

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:19.360
Because you do.

1:19:21.010 --> 1:19:23.320
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1:19:24.970 --> 1:19:26.740
But, B, he's not gonna stop.

1:19:26.940 --> 1:19:28.320
Then you make him.

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.370
There's only one way
that Dame's gonna listen.

1:19:37.940 --> 1:19:39.770
If that's what you gotta do,
then...

1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:42.590
all right.

1:19:42.790 --> 1:19:45.150
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion
of the world.

1:19:45.350 --> 1:19:47.980
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1:19:48.180 --> 1:19:50.420
The one and only Adonis Creed
is sitting right next to me.

1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:51.990
Welcome to the show, my man.
How you doing?

1:19:52.190 --> 1:19:53.730
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1:19:53.930 --> 1:19:55.730
Yeah... [stammers]
...thank you for being here.

1:19:55.930 --> 1:19:58.730
You called to be on this show,
which you've never done.

1:19:58.930 --> 1:20:01.650
I wanna know why you felt
the need

1:20:01.850 --> 1:20:03.610
to come on national television
today to speak.

1:20:03.810 --> 1:20:04.700
What's on your mind?

1:20:04.900 --> 1:20:06.610
When I walked away
from boxing,

1:20:06.810 --> 1:20:08.740
- I walked away
with some unfinished business.
- Mmm.

1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:11.570
Gotta be talking about Dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1:20:11.770 --> 1:20:13.090
Let's just get this
out of the way.

1:20:13.290 --> 1:20:14.360
You know I believe
you're the best

1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:15.920
pound-for-pound fighter
in the world,

1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:17.880
three years ago.

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:19.580
It's been a minute
since you've been
out in these streets,

1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:21.280
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying
about you.

1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:22.970
<i>A: Conlan.</i>

1:20:23.170 --> 1:20:24.720
<i>He was beyond his prime</i>
<i>when you beat him.</i>

1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:26.240
<i>B: Dame.</i>

1:20:26.440 --> 1:20:28.630
<i>He's the next king of boxing.</i>
<i>Not you. Okay?</i>

1:20:28.830 --> 1:20:30.980
<i>C: Every time you turn around,</i>

1:20:31.180 --> 1:20:32.900
<i>Dame is talking</i>
<i>about you dirty,</i>
<i>and unapologetically.</i>

1:20:33.100 --> 1:20:34.680
Hey, turn that up.

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.990
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1:20:37.190 --> 1:20:38.420
he talks about your family.

1:20:38.620 --> 1:20:40.080
He talks about
how you can't be trusted,

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:41.600
and that you run out
on your boys.

1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:43.170
No, no. No.
Wait. Let me just...

1:20:43.370 --> 1:20:45.040
Hold on.
We got a call coming in.

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:47.260
We got a call.
Put him on, right now.

1:20:47.460 --> 1:20:49.000
Hey, what up, little homey?

1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:50.570
<i>You want a tissue?</i>

1:20:50.770 --> 1:20:52.480
<i>Want me to come on there</i>
<i>and give you a hug?</i>

1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:54.400
<i>Aight, look, I'm just telling</i>
<i>everybody who you really are.</i>

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.700
<i>- How you run out on family.</i>
- [clears throat]

1:20:56.900 --> 1:21:01.230
Dame, uh, not like this.

1:21:01.430 --> 1:21:02.490
<i>This ain't the way</i>
<i>to handle it.</i>

1:21:02.690 --> 1:21:04.760
Oh, bad news, bro.
This is live.

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.800
So, I mean, this how
we gonna handle it now.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.670
<i>Little Donnie</i>
<i>ain't got nothin'.</i>
<i>He a coward.</i>

1:21:08.870 --> 1:21:11.500
You a coward, bro,
and a fraud.

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:13.330
I know it.
Everybody else know it.

1:21:13.530 --> 1:21:15.900
Hey, Apollo Creed
would be ashamed.

1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:17.220
Oh, you lost it.

1:21:17.690 --> 1:21:19.730
Aight.

1:21:19.930 --> 1:21:22.180
I challenge you
for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1:21:22.830 --> 1:21:23.640
You and me?

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:25.380
- Run it.
- Run it!

1:21:25.580 --> 1:21:27.650
[Stephen A. Smith]
Oh, hell yes.
Y'all heard it here first.

1:21:27.850 --> 1:21:29.260
<i>I know I can't wait for this.</i>

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:30.610
[Boog] There you go.
What's up, champ?

1:21:30.810 --> 1:21:32.570
- [Stitch] What's going on?
- [Boog] Prime time.

1:21:32.770 --> 1:21:35.090
[gym goer] The champ is here!
Y'all better turn it up.

1:21:35.290 --> 1:21:36.740
[Duke] Here we go, folks.

1:21:36.940 --> 1:21:40.270
[people in gym cheering,
imitating dogs]

1:21:40.470 --> 1:21:41.460
[Duke] Let's get reacquainted.

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.890
Fractured fourth
and fifth metacarpals.

1:21:52.090 --> 1:21:53.850
[Boog] Both hands.

1:21:54.050 --> 1:21:54.760
His eye socket broke.

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:55.820
Ruptured kidney.

1:21:57.520 --> 1:21:59.510
- His shoulder don't work.
- [Duke] Torn abductor.

1:21:59.710 --> 1:22:01.860
He don't got it no more.
He retired. He probably
won't even make weight.

1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:03.870
And remind me,
how many concussions
have you had?

1:22:10.220 --> 1:22:12.870
You're old, and you're broken.

1:22:13.070 --> 1:22:16.000
We know Dame.
Dame gonna have
this damn list memorized.

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:19.660
<i>He's willing to do anything</i>
<i>to win, so you gotta</i>
<i>be prepared for everything.</i>

1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:23.400
We can't turn back the clock,
we can't hide all your flaws,

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:25.410
but we can make 'em strengths.

1:22:29.030 --> 1:22:30.640
[crowd cheering]

1:22:32.380 --> 1:22:33.970
That's it. Two jabs.

1:22:34.170 --> 1:22:35.410
- Come under.
- Slip.

1:22:35.610 --> 1:22:36.500
One-one-two.

1:22:36.700 --> 1:22:37.850
- I got you.
- Let's go, D.

1:22:38.050 --> 1:22:41.200
The higher you get,
the harder it gets.

1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:43.810
That's life. That's this run!

1:22:44.010 --> 1:22:45.420
- Let's go.
- [grunting]

1:22:45.620 --> 1:22:48.380
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1:22:48.580 --> 1:22:50.430
Right here. Let's go.
Over and over.

1:22:50.630 --> 1:22:51.560
Push.

1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:52.920
Push!

1:22:54.440 --> 1:22:56.000
What you looking back, boy?
Look forward.

1:22:56.200 --> 1:22:57.650
Who slips like this?
Nobody. Bring it in.

1:22:57.850 --> 1:22:59.530
Ain't nobody gonna
take it easy on him, right?

1:23:00.750 --> 1:23:02.450
Come on. Focus up.

1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:10.890
[Duke] There you go.

1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:13.290
There you go.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:15.940
Come on, man.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.540
Stop thinking so much, man.

1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:19.950
Get your head in the game.

1:23:22.250 --> 1:23:24.860
You see that man right there?
Do you remember him?

1:23:26.910 --> 1:23:29.250
You gotta block out everything
and be in the moment.

1:23:29.450 --> 1:23:31.950
Not the past. Not the future.

1:23:32.150 --> 1:23:33.090
Right now.

1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:36.380
Let's go. Come on.

1:23:36.580 --> 1:23:37.530
[Stitch] Well...

1:23:38.310 --> 1:23:40.300
[Adonis] Hey.

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:42.430
- How's the...
- Nah, nah. Don't. Don't.

1:23:42.630 --> 1:23:43.830
But you're good?

1:23:44.030 --> 1:23:45.970
[scoffs]
Good enough to beat you.

1:23:59.120 --> 1:23:59.770
Keep your hands up.

1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:02.770
Move. Move!

1:24:04.030 --> 1:24:04.990
You can go home, dawg.

1:24:10.130 --> 1:24:11.910
- [Adonis panting]
- [punches landing]

1:24:17.790 --> 1:24:19.380
Maybe we should take a break.

1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:20.530
[Adonis] Take a break?

1:24:21.700 --> 1:24:24.050

Whoo! We're out here working
right now!

1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:15.750
Where is he? Where is he?

1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:17.180
I see you.

1:27:37.290 --> 1:27:38.200

1:31:23.140 --> 1:31:25.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening,

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:29.960
and welcome
to the Battle of Los Angeles.

1:31:31.830 --> 1:31:35.180
The fight starts now!

1:31:37.970 --> 1:31:40.260
Introducing first,
the challenger.

1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:42.480
Fighting out of the Delphi Gym

1:31:42.680 --> 1:31:47.700
and proudly representing
his home
of Los Angeles, California,

1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:54.360
here is the former light
heavyweight and heavyweight
champion of the world,

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:59.200
Adonis Creed!

1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:02.250
Creed!

1:32:03.770 --> 1:32:05.680
And his opponent
across the ring,

1:32:05.880 --> 1:32:10.990
he represents
the Crenshaw District
of Los Angeles, California.

1:32:11.190 --> 1:32:14.340
Here is the former
Golden Gloves champion

1:32:14.540 --> 1:32:18.910
and the reigning,
defending, undefeated

1:32:19.110 --> 1:32:23.390
and unified
heavyweight champion
of the world,

1:32:23.590 --> 1:32:27.670
"Diamond" Damian Anderson!

1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:30.350
Anderson!

1:32:30.550 --> 1:32:32.530
[announcer 2] Creed retired
a champion, but he's
definitely the underdog.

1:32:32.730 --> 1:32:34.530
[announcer 1]
Yeah, there's no doubt
Dame has the upper hand.

1:32:34.730 --> 1:32:36.710
He looks to be
in phenomenal shape.

1:32:36.910 --> 1:32:39.880
You both received
your instructions
in your dressing room.

1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:42.760
I want a good, clean fight.

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:46.800
Obey my commands at all times.
Above all, protect yourself
at all times.

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.250
Let's go.

1:32:49.990 --> 1:32:51.690
You on your own now,
little Donnie.

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:55.420
[referee] Go to your corners.

1:32:55.620 --> 1:32:58.210
[announcer 2]
The intensity here is
like nothing I've ever seen.

1:32:58.410 --> 1:33:01.380
Yeah, you can absolutely feel
the bad blood
between each other

1:33:01.580 --> 1:33:02.750
in this Battle of LA.

1:33:06.310 --> 1:33:08.430
- [bell rings]
- [announcer 1] And we're off.

1:33:08.630 --> 1:33:12.440
And the big question here
in round one, how much
ring rust will Adonis have?

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:14.480
Three years out of the game.

1:33:14.680 --> 1:33:18.050
And the way Dame attacks,
this could be over early.

1:33:18.250 --> 1:33:20.450
A little bit
of a cautious start
early on here.

1:33:20.650 --> 1:33:22.580
Still not clear yet
who's going to be
the one dictating.

1:33:22.780 --> 1:33:23.800
Stop holding back, D.

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:25.460
You're giving him
too much respect.

1:33:28.950 --> 1:33:32.630
[announcer 2] Anderson gets
first blood with a nasty shot
to the arm of Creed.

1:33:32.830 --> 1:33:34.810
[announcer 1] Both fighters
sizing each other up.

1:33:35.010 --> 1:33:38.940
And, boom, a stiff jab
to the face lands,
and Creed is gonna tie him up.

1:33:39.140 --> 1:33:40.610
[crowd boos]

1:33:43.700 --> 1:33:45.250
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1:33:45.450 --> 1:33:46.990
[Duke] You gotta commit, D!
Gotta commit!

1:33:47.190 --> 1:33:48.360
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:02.760
[Duke] Come on, D!

1:34:05.420 --> 1:34:08.060
[announcer 1] I'd give
that round to Anderson
with an impressive start here.

1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:10.410
All right, little Donnie.
I'll see you in a minute.

1:34:10.610 --> 1:34:12.160
Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

1:34:13.340 --> 1:34:15.410
Way to hang out there.
Wear him out.

1:34:15.610 --> 1:34:18.070
Look, the boy a punk.
He see you not scared.

1:34:18.270 --> 1:34:19.900
Now it's time for him
to start fighting dirty,
right?

1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:21.810
Keep your head on tight.
Let him make mistakes.

1:34:22.010 --> 1:34:23.250
He gonna make
a lot of them, all right?

1:34:23.450 --> 1:34:25.560
And attack those windows
when they open.

1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:27.430
[trainer] You throwing
power punches, champ.

1:34:27.630 --> 1:34:29.300
- Pace yourself.
- [Dame] I know
what I'm doing.

1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:30.600
Don't worry about me.

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:32.520
All that money can't save him.
Believe that.

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:34.650
[announcer 2] You gotta wonder
if Creed's regretting

1:34:34.850 --> 1:34:36.520
his decision
to get back in the ring.

1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:38.790
Retirement sure seems like
it would be a lot more fun.

1:34:38.990 --> 1:34:40.830
[bell rings]

1:34:41.030 --> 1:34:44.400
[announcer 1] Round two
underway here
in Los Angeles, live on DAZN.

1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:46.970
Let's see if Adonis can find
his championship form

1:34:47.170 --> 1:34:48.720
and make a fight out of this.

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:56.470
Stop running, Donnie.

1:35:00.990 --> 1:35:02.040
[Duke] Yes!

1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:06.640
[referee] Yo, keep 'em up.

1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.350
[Duke] What I tell you, huh?
Here he comes.

1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:15.610
- Come on, ref.
- Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

1:35:15.810 --> 1:35:17.790
That cheap shit
all you got, old man?
Can't beat me heads up?

1:35:18.450 --> 1:35:19.360
[Dame grunting]

1:35:33.850 --> 1:35:34.990
You had enough, boy?

1:35:39.470 --> 1:35:40.770
Tie him up, baby. Tie him up.

1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:46.780
You thought this shit
was gonna be easy.

1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:55.610
[bell rings]

1:35:58.010 --> 1:36:00.950
[announcer 1] What
an exciting close to round two
in the battle of LA.

1:36:01.150 --> 1:36:03.490
Both men giving us
some tremendous blows.

1:36:04.490 --> 1:36:05.790
[Duke] That was better.

1:36:05.990 --> 1:36:08.050
Stay focused. You take him
where you need to go.

1:36:08.250 --> 1:36:10.180
Keep punching through.
Leave him open...

1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:12.530
- [muffled dialogue]
- [breathes heavily]

1:36:12.730 --> 1:36:15.060

control you.

1:38:42.190 --> 1:38:43.900
You can feel the tension.

This is history spilling
into the ring.

1:38:46.710 --> 1:38:48.400
What an emotionally draining
war here in Los Angeles.

1:38:56.940 --> 1:38:59.350

Let go of the fear.
You hear me?

1:39:06.910 --> 1:39:08.200
Let go of the guilt.

1:39:09.070 --> 1:39:11.140
Let go of it, dawg.

[announcer 1]
Creed beats the count,
but here comes Dame.

1:43:11.270 --> 1:43:13.870
[muffled] Good.
Back training hard,
back getting back focused.

1:43:14.070 --> 1:43:14.840
Back for the next phase.

1:43:15.750 --> 1:43:17.230
We're back in business.

1:43:27.630 --> 1:43:28.680
[exhales]

1:43:42.730 --> 1:43:44.000
[trainer]
We'll be in the hall, champ.

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:09.020
[Adonis sighs]

1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.810
Guess you did learn
a few moves without me.

1:44:34.310 --> 1:44:35.390
Dame, I'm sorry.

1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:39.750
All those years...

1:44:42.790 --> 1:44:43.970
I never checked up on you.

1:44:46.970 --> 1:44:47.970
That's on me.

1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:01.250
We were just...

1:45:04.290 --> 1:45:05.290
kids, bro.

1:45:13.260 --> 1:45:14.560
It ain't on you.

1:45:23.270 --> 1:45:24.230
None of it.

1:45:29.410 --> 1:45:30.710
Never was.

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:34.800
Hey, D.

1:45:38.460 --> 1:45:39.590
It wasn't on you either.

1:45:47.990 --> 1:45:48.860
[Damian sniffles]

1:46:04.350 --> 1:46:06.620
[chuckles]
Aight, go ahead then, man.

1:46:09.310 --> 1:46:11.060
Family and everybody
waiting on you.

1:46:12.710 --> 1:46:13.840
Champ.

1:46:26.110 --> 1:46:27.940
You know where to find me
if you need me.

1:46:42.430 --> 1:46:44.480
[grunting]

1:46:52.100 --> 1:46:54.260
You know she's been waiting
all night for this, right?

1:46:54.460 --> 1:46:55.610
[both chuckling]

1:46:55.810 --> 1:46:57.140
She looks good in there.

1:46:58.100 --> 1:46:59.930
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

1:47:03.670 --> 1:47:04.800
- Hmm?
- You all right?

1:47:06.460 --> 1:47:07.330
I'm better now.

1:47:17.470 --> 1:47:18.510
[Adonis chuckles]

1:47:21.690 --> 1:47:23.420
[Bianca] Okay.

1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:25.520
[Adonis] All right.
All right, all right.

1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:30.960
Ready?

1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:37.260
- Ow! Ooh.
- [Bianca chuckling]

1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:39.490
- Knock him out. [chuckles]
- Ooh! [chuckles]

1:47:43.970 --> 1:47:45.540
[Adonis] Yeah.

1:47:47.930 --> 1:47:49.150
No!

1:47:57.550 --> 1:47:58.380
[chuckling]

1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.370
- [Adonis shouts]
- [Bianca chuckles]

1:48:02.570 --> 1:48:04.730
[Bianca] Now we have
a new champ!

1:48:06.430 --> 1:48:08.170
I'm the champ!

1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:12.220
She's the champ!
She's the champ!

1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:19.300
Home?

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:20.050
Mm-hmm.

1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:23.490
Yeah.

1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:37.160
[Bianca chuckles]

1:48:51.780 --> 1:48:53.040
[sighs]

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:06.230
[dramatic music playing]

1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:47.780
[intriguing music playing]

1:54:37.170 --> 1:54:39.000
