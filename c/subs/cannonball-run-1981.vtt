00:57.693 --> 01:00.128
What do you say
when there are no words

01:01.032 --> 01:02.363
Feel it

01:04.637 --> 01:07.697
Feel a song
that's never been heard

01:08.307 --> 01:09.829
Sing it

01:11.910 --> 01:13.674
How do you know
when you hear the call

01:15.547 --> 01:16.879
Answer

01:18.952 --> 01:21.216
What do you do
when you've done it all

01:22.791 --> 01:24.382
Ball

01:24.458 --> 01:28.656
THE CANNONBALL RUN
Cannonball

01:29.765 --> 01:32.529
It's not what you do
it's how you do it

01:33.869 --> 01:36.736
Be anything you want to be

01:36.805 --> 01:41.106
It's not what you got
it's how you use it

01:41.175 --> 01:43.111
You be you and I'll be me

01:43.179 --> 01:46.809
It's just a matter of style

01:46.883 --> 01:48.545
You can't fake it

01:48.620 --> 01:50.678
Mile after mile, feeling free

01:50.755 --> 01:53.884
If you've got the soul

01:53.959 --> 01:56.118
You can make it

01:56.193 --> 01:59.560
Move 'em out, let 'em roll

01:59.632 --> 02:04.002
From sea to shining sea

02:06.440 --> 02:08.566
Ball

02:09.976 --> 02:12.377
Cannonball

02:13.682 --> 02:16.776
What do you do
when the mountain is there

02:17.350 --> 02:18.944
Move it

02:21.023 --> 02:24.049
How do you answer
the challenging dare

02:24.125 --> 02:25.719
Take it

02:28.099 --> 02:30.291
When your back's against the wall

02:31.702 --> 02:33.694
Feel it

02:35.340 --> 02:37.741
What do you do
when you've done it all

02:40.945 --> 02:41.912
Cannonball

02:46.387 --> 02:50.048
It's not what you do
it's how you do it

02:50.124 --> 02:53.583
Be anything you want to be

02:53.659 --> 02:57.688
It's not what you've got
it's how you use it

02:57.765 --> 02:59.700
You be you and I'll be me

02:59.767 --> 03:03.260
It's just a matter of style

03:03.338 --> 03:07.105
You can't fake it
Mile after mile, feeling free

03:07.177 --> 03:10.575
If you've got the soul

03:10.645 --> 03:12.409
You can make it

03:12.482 --> 03:15.781
Move 'em out
Let 'em roll

03:16.352 --> 03:21.722
From sea to shining sea

03:22.828 --> 03:24.760
Ball

03:27.666 --> 03:31.261
Headquarters, we are still
in pursuit of the black Lamborghini.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.567
Car 42, you've been in pursuit
for two hours.

03:34.638 --> 03:37.165
Another five minutes,
and you'll be in Arizona.

03:37.242 --> 03:40.805
Yeah, and we're gonna stay in pursuit
until we catch him.

03:40.878 --> 03:44.112
It didn't take us that long
to catch Dillinger.

04:07.579 --> 04:08.511
Hi, guys.

04:18.656 --> 04:21.250
- You're two hours late.
- I'm sorry.

04:21.326 --> 04:24.297
Where the hell you been?

04:24.361 --> 04:26.333
I'm sorry.

04:27.998 --> 04:30.868
Fuel-injection system...
It's driving me crazy.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.429
I'm really sorry I'm late, but one
of my hamsters had an anxiety attack.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.500
I couldn't leave him
until he was settled down.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.671
He was acting so crazy.
He ate a piece of tail.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.341
And Henrietta wasn't even
bothering him.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.817
Then he ate his treadmill.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.518
They got vets for that.
We got other things to worry about.

04:51.594 --> 04:54.894
Hamsters are a big responsibility.

04:54.964 --> 04:57.728
Let me paint you a mental picture,
all right, Victor?

04:57.801 --> 05:01.101
I want you to think of your hamsters
as a little army...

05:01.171 --> 05:03.198
marching along on a treadmill...

05:03.276 --> 05:06.767
running their little legs off,
running as fast as they can...

05:06.847 --> 05:09.973
making that engine just
purr right along the road.

05:10.049 --> 05:14.818
Oh,j.j. What a wonderful way
to put it.

05:17.256 --> 05:21.627
Wouldn't it be great if we could share
winning the Cannonball with them?

05:21.695 --> 05:26.565
That would be a real team effort...
you, me, the hamsters and him.

05:41.484 --> 05:45.476
Don't start with him.
I don't want to talk about him.

05:45.557 --> 05:49.287
- If you need any help...
- I don't want to talk about him.

05:55.867 --> 05:59.200
- Sir james!
- Oh, my God. You again?

05:59.272 --> 06:01.263
Fenderbaum, do me a favor.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.501
You're drawing flies.
Get the hell out of here.

06:03.574 --> 06:06.045
Wait a minute, Greek.
Only thing I want to know is...

06:06.115 --> 06:09.706
how are you figuring the odds
on this Cannonball cockamamie?

06:09.781 --> 06:12.549
It takes brilliance
and years of hard work...

06:12.619 --> 06:14.522
and you wouldn't understand
any part of that.

06:14.588 --> 06:17.558
Do me a favor.
A race is a race, right?

06:17.625 --> 06:20.528
The only thing you gotta do
in the Cannonball is drive steady...

06:20.595 --> 06:22.529
stay out of trouble
and have a good cover.

06:22.597 --> 06:25.795
3,000 miles averaging
85 miles an hour.

06:25.869 --> 06:27.666
Do you know what that is?

06:27.737 --> 06:30.603
You want to talk
or do you want to bet?

06:30.675 --> 06:34.270
Anti- radar paint,
turbocharged,j.j.

06:34.343 --> 06:37.542
Nobody can stop us now.
Nobody.

06:53.065 --> 06:57.026
What are you, some kind of nut?
Who do you think you are?

06:59.640 --> 07:02.075
I am Captain Chaos.

07:03.980 --> 07:08.438
And this...
This is my faithful companion, Cato.

07:08.517 --> 07:10.612
Say hello, Cato.

07:12.356 --> 07:14.481
Been a cop long?

07:17.396 --> 07:20.055
Funny!
You wanna talk or you wanna bet?

07:20.129 --> 07:23.030
- You got 50 to 1.
- And you know what you got?

07:23.101 --> 07:25.294
You got yourself a bet.

07:25.370 --> 07:28.601
Twenty big large ones.

07:28.672 --> 07:30.038
That's a million dollars.

07:31.209 --> 07:32.869
If you win.

07:32.944 --> 07:37.210
I don't know if you know my partner.
Jamie, you remember jimmy the Greek.

07:38.819 --> 07:40.308
Jamie Blake.

07:40.387 --> 07:43.083
You used to drive
that Formula One...

07:43.156 --> 07:45.316
when high- button shoes
were in style.

07:45.392 --> 07:47.657
Let me tell you something, Greek.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.698
We got a secret weapon.

07:49.764 --> 07:53.462
- God is our copilot.
- You'll need him.

07:57.539 --> 08:00.564
"God is our copilot"?

08:00.641 --> 08:02.872
- Remember our car?
- Yeah.

08:02.947 --> 08:05.744
- Two seats?
- Two seats.

08:05.815 --> 08:09.411
Where's he gonna sit?
Where?

08:11.188 --> 08:13.180
Listen to me, El Porko.

08:13.257 --> 08:17.421
We're not in the Indianapolis 500.
We can't have a car with numbers on it.

08:17.496 --> 08:21.127
- We have to camouflage the car somehow.
- Like what,j.j.?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.897
How about a limousine
with diplomatic plates?

08:25.874 --> 08:28.397
I know. A bloodmobile.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.034
They'd never stop
a bloodmobile, would they?

08:31.112 --> 08:34.011
Ice cream truck!
An ice cream truck!

08:34.081 --> 08:36.106
You know. They got to get there
before it melts.

08:40.123 --> 08:41.714
Terrific.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.851
- We're out of beer, Victor.
- Sorry.

08:45.093 --> 08:47.789
Take it easy! You're acting crazy
since this Cannonball thing!

08:47.863 --> 08:50.128
I'm gonna pull in here
and get some beer, all right?

08:54.070 --> 08:57.335
How about an armored personnel carrier?
They wouldn't stop that, would they?

09:12.392 --> 09:15.518
Hey, don't bother to park.
I'll be right out.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.001
Thank you.

09:29.075 --> 09:32.070
We could get a black Trans Am.
No, that's been done.

09:56.576 --> 09:59.635
Hello, Mother.
I trust you've had a pleasant day.

09:59.713 --> 10:02.911
A nightmare.
A living nightmare.

10:02.984 --> 10:05.075
You are killing me, Seymour...

10:05.150 --> 10:09.747
killing me a slow death
with this idiot spy business.

10:09.825 --> 10:13.624
- Mother, you don't understand.
- What is there to understand?

10:13.695 --> 10:17.426
I'm looking at my son,
Seymour Goldfarb,jr...

10:17.497 --> 10:20.591
son of Seymour Goldfarb,
God rest his soul...

10:20.668 --> 10:23.763
and heir to the Goldfarb Girdles
fortune.

10:23.838 --> 10:25.774
And what is he doing?

10:25.842 --> 10:27.833
Walking around, acting...

10:27.912 --> 10:31.314
like he was some goy movie star
named Roger Moore.

10:31.383 --> 10:34.249
And for this I sent you
to the best schools?

10:34.318 --> 10:37.756
For this I'm spending 8,000
on orthodontia work?

10:37.820 --> 10:41.279
For this I'm going broke
paying that Beverly Hills analyst?

10:41.361 --> 10:42.917
And now...

10:42.994 --> 10:44.518
this.

10:45.432 --> 10:48.991
The sleep-in maid found it
under your pillow this morning.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.263
What is the meaning of this?

10:51.337 --> 10:54.068
The meaning, Mother dear,
is a quick death.

10:54.143 --> 10:56.975
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

10:57.046 --> 11:00.536
Seymour, put that away.
It's liable to go off.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.777
I'm terribly sorry, Mother...

11:02.850 --> 11:05.182
but you know too much.

11:05.253 --> 11:07.187
You see, in my business...

11:07.256 --> 11:11.351
even the deepest family relationships
aren't worth a farthing.

11:11.425 --> 11:12.793
Farthing, schmarthing.

11:17.101 --> 11:18.694
Zie gezunt, Mama.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.599
Where did I go wrong?

11:23.674 --> 11:26.142
You know something, Mama?
You're too jewish.

11:27.647 --> 11:30.548
Of course, we could always go
with a nice, plain- jane Chevy...

11:30.651 --> 11:33.117
with a truckload
of Sidewinder missiles.

11:33.184 --> 11:35.847
J. J., maybe you should slow this down
just a little bit.

11:35.921 --> 11:39.380
- I can't hear you.
- I said, you're making waves.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.552
- You're bothering the people.
- What the hell does going too fast...

11:42.627 --> 11:45.563
got to do with being
in the Cannonball?

11:45.634 --> 11:48.758
J. J., you're making very big waves.

11:48.836 --> 11:51.361
How are ya?

12:02.951 --> 12:07.119
You guys are lucky.
You tore the heck out of that boat.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.954
- You all right, Victor?
- Oh, I'm fine,j.j.

12:10.026 --> 12:13.086
It only hurts when I point.

12:13.163 --> 12:15.222
You know, maybe
it would've been better...

12:15.298 --> 12:18.235
if you didn't pay
so much attention to those girls.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.327
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's true.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.339
Nobody's perfect...

12:22.408 --> 12:23.932
but him.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.270
Sorry.

12:27.349 --> 12:28.973
How far is it
to the hospital?

12:29.049 --> 12:30.982
- About ten miles.
- Oh, yeah?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.018
How long will it take us
to get there?

12:33.087 --> 12:34.451
About four or five minutes.

12:34.522 --> 12:37.489
You can smoke through traffic like
shot through a gun in this thing.

14:32.988 --> 14:34.288
Camel.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.891
Not the Camel, schmuck. Winston.

15:09.198 --> 15:12.066
Starting tomorrow, you and George
will be riding in the car with me.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.065
Yes, sir.

15:21.979 --> 15:24.071
How goes your driving, my brother?

15:24.148 --> 15:26.444
Allah be praised, dear sister.

15:26.517 --> 15:30.544
My speed is rivaled only by
the lightning bolts from the heavens.

15:35.729 --> 15:38.721
And I suppose you still intend
to go through that race...

15:38.798 --> 15:40.628
with the infidel Americans.

15:40.701 --> 15:42.827
Cannonball will fall...

15:42.901 --> 15:45.064
to the forces of Islam!

15:45.139 --> 15:48.437
My dear sister, I pledge it!

15:48.510 --> 15:50.978
Drink! Drink!

15:51.046 --> 15:53.379
- The car will be there, correct?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.608
Don't forget to cancel
the board meeting on Monday.

15:55.752 --> 15:59.050
I'm going to spend a week
in Spain at the castle.

15:59.121 --> 16:02.319
- Yes, Mr. Compton.
- I want you to find an old friend...

16:02.394 --> 16:04.383
a Mr. Shakey Finch.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.055
He is the finest long- distance
motorcycle rider in this nation.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.066
- You got it?
- Yes, Mr. Compton.

16:11.501 --> 16:15.769
Mr. Compton, the board has asked me
to express their concern one more time.

16:15.841 --> 16:18.741
- Please reconsider.
- Not possible, Arthur.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.779
The board will have to permit me
this one indulgence...

16:21.846 --> 16:23.370
to my ego.

16:28.923 --> 16:32.049
I've gotta be free

16:32.125 --> 16:35.392
I've gotta be me

16:35.463 --> 16:37.055
To live

16:45.809 --> 16:48.276
Got to be free

16:48.343 --> 16:51.575
- Boy, ain't he something?
- Are you kidding?

16:51.648 --> 16:53.912
That is the dumbest thing I've seen
since that dimwit...

16:53.983 --> 16:55.885
tried to jump the Grand Canyon.

17:00.659 --> 17:02.717
He's still on our ass.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.259
I don't think...
I don't think...

17:04.327 --> 17:06.059
I don't think he's a brother either.

17:06.131 --> 17:09.964
Don't you worry, son.
I'm gonna lose him up here at the motel.

17:10.035 --> 17:13.061
Hey, I remember.
There's a spot...

17:13.140 --> 17:16.233
There's a spot right in back...

17:16.308 --> 17:18.244
and it's a perfect spot to hide.

17:18.310 --> 17:20.676
All right. Wonderful, wonderful.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.409
- Take... Take...
- Left.

17:22.483 --> 17:24.416
Oh, hell. Take a left.

17:27.122 --> 17:29.682
I can't see shit, can you?

17:29.757 --> 17:32.056
No problem, son.
No problem.

17:34.661 --> 17:35.822
What was that?

17:47.913 --> 17:50.539
That's... That's... That's...

17:52.283 --> 17:53.876
perfect.

17:53.952 --> 17:55.977
That's better than hiding...

17:56.053 --> 17:58.489
- That's better than hiding it out back.
- I know.

17:58.558 --> 18:00.492
But the only problem
we got now...

18:00.559 --> 18:02.994
is we have to go and retune it.

18:03.061 --> 18:05.462
All right?
Let's go get a beer first.

18:05.531 --> 18:08.127
Yeah, let's go get... Let's... Beer.

18:09.569 --> 18:13.130
I'd like to thank Mona Carson
of Westport...

18:13.207 --> 18:15.368
for that wonderful combination
of hemp sandwiches...

18:15.443 --> 18:18.277
and wood chip consomme.

18:18.346 --> 18:22.373
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

18:22.453 --> 18:24.419
This is a titty turn...

18:24.486 --> 18:26.614
terrific turnout for the meeting.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.954
- Yes, terrific.
- He led the campaign...

18:29.025 --> 18:33.429
to ban the use of electric toothbrushes
during peak load hours.

18:35.034 --> 18:37.364
I suppose you...

18:37.435 --> 18:39.368
came here to hear me speak.

18:39.437 --> 18:43.167
No, not really.
I'm into trees.

18:44.944 --> 18:46.377
Trees.

18:47.879 --> 18:49.813
Friends of Nature love trees,
you know...

18:49.881 --> 18:51.873
so I come to the meetings.

18:51.951 --> 18:54.386
That's very interesting.

18:54.454 --> 18:56.979
I love anybody who loves trees.

18:57.057 --> 19:00.586
They happen to be
a great passion of mine.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.061
You know what I like
best about trees?

19:03.130 --> 19:05.860
- No, what?
- That you can lie under them...

19:05.934 --> 19:08.801
on a moonlit night
with the breeze blowing...

19:08.871 --> 19:11.339
ball your brains out.

19:11.407 --> 19:13.806
Mr. Arthur j. Foyt.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.747
Mr. Foyt.

19:24.321 --> 19:26.552
Give that sucker some juice.

19:26.624 --> 19:31.029
The only thing hiding it...
hiding it... hiding it in the pool...

19:31.097 --> 19:34.361
did was make it pretty.

19:34.432 --> 19:36.730
It ain't running worth a shit.
And it's wet!

19:36.801 --> 19:39.363
I know that. Just hit it
one more time, all right?

19:41.107 --> 19:44.474
Hold it! Hold it!
I know what's wrong.

19:44.545 --> 19:46.479
Don't think for a minute...

19:46.549 --> 19:49.950
that we in Washington...

19:50.019 --> 19:52.715
don't appreciate your Mothers' March...

19:52.788 --> 19:56.153
to ban the sale
of colored toilet paper...

19:56.226 --> 19:59.218
to help reduce irritation...

19:59.296 --> 20:01.695
of the rectum.

20:04.803 --> 20:05.996
But today...

20:06.068 --> 20:09.231
I want to direct my remarks...

20:09.307 --> 20:10.830
to an old...

20:10.908 --> 20:13.876
and familiar enemy...

20:14.980 --> 20:16.312
the automobile.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.914
One more time.
Let me hear it.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.428
It reminds me of a poem...

20:28.494 --> 20:30.430
I wrote.

20:30.498 --> 20:33.330
"The automobile, the automobile..."

20:48.284 --> 20:49.979
Are you all right?

20:50.051 --> 20:52.681
They picked on the wrong one
this time!

20:52.757 --> 20:55.486
I guarantee
they're gonna pay for this...

20:55.557 --> 20:58.186
because when the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.892
She's running good now, buddy.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.131
I still think
we ought to paint it.

21:06.205 --> 21:09.504
If we're gonna paint it, let's go ahead
and Midasize it, all right?

21:13.945 --> 21:15.345
There's the motel.

21:15.414 --> 21:18.385
The Cannonballers have the parking lot
all jammed up.

21:18.450 --> 21:21.046
Man, I can't handle this traffic.

21:21.123 --> 21:23.885
Hold on to your lunch pail.
This may get a little weird.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.153
Wait a minute.

21:27.228 --> 21:28.160
Slow down!

21:36.472 --> 21:38.566
You the one running this flea bag?

21:38.643 --> 21:40.632
- Where are the hookers?
- What?

21:40.709 --> 21:43.376
Hookers, man.
Where are the hookers?

21:43.446 --> 21:45.382
Excuse me.

21:47.118 --> 21:49.347
- Hello, Mad Dog.
- Hey,j.j.

21:49.421 --> 21:51.614
You probably didn't realize this,
but the parking lot's outside.

21:51.688 --> 21:53.850
Yeah, I know.
Brakes went out.

21:53.926 --> 21:56.223
- You think you're the president?
- Well...

21:56.292 --> 21:58.924
let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.264
We feel terrible about it.
And if they can't take a joke...

22:05.072 --> 22:07.597
Thank goodness. We just had
a terrible accident.

22:07.673 --> 22:09.642
We'd like to help you,
but we're off duty.

22:09.710 --> 22:12.236
This man looks bad.
Maybe he's dead.

22:12.314 --> 22:15.646
Then you should call the coroner.
J. J., he don't look too good.

22:18.888 --> 22:21.411
- I think he just had his bell rung.
- Can't you do something?

22:21.491 --> 22:23.686
You're professionals.

22:23.761 --> 22:25.420
This is our day off.

22:25.494 --> 22:29.328
Will you guys do something?
This man's life is hanging by a thread.

22:38.308 --> 22:41.437
You have to be scientific. It could go
up the nostrils, affect the sinuses.

22:41.512 --> 22:43.447
That's true.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.028
There.
Don't bother about the bill.

22:56.096 --> 22:58.656
Just give him
a couple of enemas...

22:58.734 --> 23:00.791
and call me in the morning.

23:02.438 --> 23:04.302
- Hi. How's it going?
- Perfect.

23:04.371 --> 23:07.364
We'd like two singles.
J.j. McClure, Victor Prinzim.

23:07.442 --> 23:09.707
I'll be in the bar.

23:09.777 --> 23:12.111
I always like a couple drinks
right after surgery.

23:19.255 --> 23:21.416
I wonder why that guy
parked his truck in the lobby.

23:21.491 --> 23:23.925
Only in America.
Get me 12 suites.

23:23.994 --> 23:26.396
- Better yet, the entire floor.
- Yes, sir.

23:28.434 --> 23:30.992
Too much couscous.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.163
I would sure as H
like to get my hands...

23:33.239 --> 23:36.172
on those Hell's Angels
who were driving that truck.

23:37.443 --> 23:39.376
But you know, it's probably
just as well...

23:39.446 --> 23:42.812
because I am a wild bull
when I lose my temper.

23:44.685 --> 23:46.618
I love wild bulls.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.461
It's really funny that you should...
Oh, my God. It's them.

23:53.662 --> 23:55.187
- "Them" who?
- Those Hell's Angels.

23:55.263 --> 23:57.754
They could be part
of a terrorist group.

23:57.834 --> 23:59.461
I don't know.

24:01.102 --> 24:03.833
This place is filling up...

24:03.907 --> 24:06.431
with some real hoodlums.

24:06.508 --> 24:09.501
Do you see anything weird back there?

24:10.681 --> 24:12.239
I'm gonna find out.

24:23.697 --> 24:26.857
I don't understand why it's
so difficult for you to find a doctor.

24:26.932 --> 24:31.131
It's very, very hard. It's not easy
finding a doctor to take off like that.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.467
- Dr. Gay doesn't even leave his house.
- You don't understand.

24:33.541 --> 24:37.034
If you're going to win and you're
driving an ambulance, you need a doctor.

24:38.579 --> 24:41.572
- What does Dr. Gay do?
- He's my shrink.

24:41.651 --> 24:43.582
- He was committed yesterday.
- Why?

24:43.652 --> 24:46.450
He was smoking bananas.

24:46.522 --> 24:49.491
He gets very upset
when he talks to him.

24:49.561 --> 24:51.493
So do I.

24:52.663 --> 24:56.293
Sorry.
I don't want fruit in my drink.

24:59.703 --> 25:01.138
Congratulations.

25:01.206 --> 25:03.731
Here's to you.
Good luck.

25:06.578 --> 25:07.978
You dumb shits.

25:08.047 --> 25:10.311
They haven't got a chance.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.940
You know what?

25:12.018 --> 25:15.545
I think I'm gonna call the Greek
and put another 10,000 on us.

25:19.259 --> 25:21.692
What about those two?

25:21.762 --> 25:24.231
Maybe one of those beauties
could be our patient.

25:24.299 --> 25:26.823
Both of them could be.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.233
I could be very patient
with those patients.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.805
They're very lick...
very likeable.

25:32.874 --> 25:36.403
Tell you what. Let's go over there
and talk to them.

25:36.478 --> 25:38.207
- Okay.
- I'll do all the talking.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.047
You just think about the doctor.

25:52.397 --> 25:54.195
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hello.

25:54.267 --> 25:57.895
My name is j.j. McClure, and this is
Victor Prinzim, my executive assistant.

25:57.970 --> 25:59.960
- Hi.
- I'll do the talking, Victor.

26:00.038 --> 26:02.235
Terrorists, my dimpled ass.

26:02.306 --> 26:06.835
These people make terrorists look like
the Sisters of Charity.

26:06.914 --> 26:10.406
These guys are Cannonballers.

26:12.987 --> 26:14.921
What is that, a bowling team?

26:14.991 --> 26:17.516
As you probably know, we're
the favorites to win the Cannonball...

26:17.592 --> 26:19.527
and I was wondering if one of you
or both of you...

26:19.594 --> 26:21.529
might like to ride
in the winning vehicle.

26:21.595 --> 26:24.063
That would be very exciting.

26:24.132 --> 26:25.692
Exciting.

26:25.769 --> 26:27.929
But we're Cannonballers ourselves,
thank you.

26:28.005 --> 26:30.164
They're Cannonballers.

26:30.241 --> 26:31.971
As for the winning vehicle...

26:32.043 --> 26:34.238
we'll just have to wait and see.

26:34.311 --> 26:35.711
You haven't seen our equipment.

26:38.216 --> 26:39.205
Equipment?

27:14.056 --> 27:15.820
Don't tell me your name.

27:15.893 --> 27:17.825
Let me guess.

27:32.876 --> 27:34.847
I'll just call you Beauty, okay?

27:34.915 --> 27:36.779
That's nice.

27:36.850 --> 27:38.475
Thank you.

27:38.551 --> 27:40.109
Sit down.

27:44.325 --> 27:46.120
Are you one of those volleyballers?

27:46.193 --> 27:48.593
Cannonballers. No.

27:48.662 --> 27:50.130
Why are you dressed like that?

27:51.033 --> 27:53.193
Humanitarian reasons.

27:53.268 --> 27:56.396
I'm a wealthy philanthropist.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.599
Me and my partner ride around
in an ambulance...

27:58.673 --> 28:02.008
Looking for accidents,
trying to help people.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.377
I don't think we were put
on this earth to hurt people.

28:05.449 --> 28:07.381
I think we were put
on this earth to...

28:07.452 --> 28:08.975
help people.

28:09.053 --> 28:11.545
- That's beautiful.
- Thank you.

28:11.622 --> 28:14.421
You must be a sensitive person.

28:14.492 --> 28:15.722
I try to be.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.388
I bet you're a fan of Rod McKuen.

28:18.466 --> 28:20.159
I listen to him every night.

28:20.233 --> 28:25.635
I'm into trees.
Have you ever heard of joyce Kilmer?

28:25.706 --> 28:27.832
She wrote a terrific poem
about a tree.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.375
He.

28:29.445 --> 28:30.637
Who?

28:30.712 --> 28:33.177
- He.
- He's a she?

28:33.247 --> 28:34.508
She's a he.

28:35.950 --> 28:39.680
Well, he wrote a really terrific
poem about a tree.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.890
- You know what I like best about trees?
- No, what?

28:43.959 --> 28:46.722
That you can lie under them
on a moonlit night...

28:46.795 --> 28:48.990
the leaves gently
blowing in the trees...

28:51.401 --> 28:52.527
Sorry.

28:52.601 --> 28:56.470
It's all right.
What were you saying about trees?

28:56.539 --> 29:00.568
I was saying,
what I like best about trees...

29:00.645 --> 29:04.672
is that, on a moonlit night
you can lie under them...

29:04.750 --> 29:06.878
with the leaves gently blowing...

29:06.953 --> 29:10.481
Hey,j. J., you'll never believe
what just happened to him.

29:10.558 --> 29:12.888
- I don't want to talk about it.
- He had the most wonderful time...

29:12.957 --> 29:16.019
I don't want to talk about him.
Victor, Beauty. Beauty, Victor.

29:16.094 --> 29:19.223
- Hello, Victor.
- You really are.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.789
- Do you want to hear about the doc?
- He's telling me about the doctor.

29:21.868 --> 29:23.835
- Oh, it's about the doctor.
- It's really important.

29:23.904 --> 29:26.600
- We need a doc for the ambulance.
- It'll keep.

29:26.675 --> 29:28.368
I'll leave you two alone.

29:28.443 --> 29:32.107
- But listen, I think you should hear...
- It'll keep!

29:32.182 --> 29:34.240
- It's really important.
- I want to talk to her.

29:35.586 --> 29:37.518
Who?

29:39.024 --> 29:40.512
Now do you want to hear
about the doc?

29:40.591 --> 29:43.080
- No!
- It'll keep.

29:45.597 --> 29:48.462
Hey, Brad, old buddy!
How the hell are you?

29:50.100 --> 29:52.626
My God, it is you.
Hello, Shakey!

29:55.371 --> 29:57.898
Shakey, it's kind of tough
to get close to you.

29:57.975 --> 30:00.447
Last time I saw you,
you were a bit more svelte.

30:00.513 --> 30:03.174
Yeah, well, what can I tell you?
In the pizza business, when it's slow...

30:03.250 --> 30:06.185
you tend to eat the inventory.

30:06.253 --> 30:08.653
But that's not good for the Cannonball.
You know that.

30:08.721 --> 30:10.987
You don't need a motorcycle.
You need the Super Chief.

30:12.627 --> 30:15.322
Even with the extra tonnage,
I'm still the best there is.

30:15.398 --> 30:17.627
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.

30:17.699 --> 30:20.999
I got a throttle that's been sticking.
Why don't you fix that?

30:21.069 --> 30:24.165
Boss, this is the biggest coup...

30:24.240 --> 30:26.870
in the history
of the safety enforcement unit.

30:28.010 --> 30:30.377
We're gonna blow this
Cannonball thing wide open...

30:30.447 --> 30:32.915
and then we're gonna hit congress
for a real budget...

30:32.982 --> 30:35.510
that will allow us to play
some real hardball.

30:35.585 --> 30:37.680
I mean, this is
our Three Mile Island...

30:37.756 --> 30:40.022
and Love Canal combined.

30:43.029 --> 30:46.624
- What's wrong?
- Look at the chicks.

30:47.899 --> 30:49.527
- What is it?
- Look at the chicks!

30:51.370 --> 30:53.965
If we were Methodists...

30:54.041 --> 30:57.501
what a shot we could have had
of getting laid right here.

30:59.081 --> 31:02.241
Listen, I want to get up there.
I don't want to miss a thing.

31:04.153 --> 31:07.520
All right. There you go.
Just as good as new. Give her a try.

31:07.589 --> 31:09.487
- That's it?
- That's it.

31:09.557 --> 31:12.117
All right.

31:12.193 --> 31:13.891
We'll see.

31:15.064 --> 31:18.000
Hey, I don't think it's the throttle.
I think it's the clutch!

31:18.068 --> 31:20.333
Good-bye.

31:20.404 --> 31:22.769
Look out!
Hey, watch out!

31:22.839 --> 31:24.499
Watch out!

31:26.111 --> 31:28.773
Coming through!

31:35.689 --> 31:38.123
What in the hell was that?

31:38.192 --> 31:41.217
That must be the entry
of the National Safety Council.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.892
Good day.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.131
I am here to participate
in your little jaunt to California.

32:18.204 --> 32:20.899
Well, of course.
If you would sign in here, please.

32:25.346 --> 32:27.778
Hold still, Petey.
Say cheese.

32:29.249 --> 32:32.378
I realize the novelty
of a major celebrity...

32:32.453 --> 32:34.386
entering your little race...

32:34.455 --> 32:38.084
but kindly resist the temptation and
keep the media coverage to a minimum.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.252
- Thank you.
- Will you hurry the hell up?

32:57.014 --> 32:58.606
Hurry up!

33:12.432 --> 33:16.458
Man does not live
on... on bread alone.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.665
What concerns me is, do we have
enough ice for all this beer?

33:21.209 --> 33:22.869
Plenty.

33:22.945 --> 33:25.970
Yeah, well, how about food, son.
Did you bring enough food?

33:27.113 --> 33:28.047
Plenty.

33:28.116 --> 33:30.175
Will you get serious?
Give me the rest of that beer.

33:40.996 --> 33:42.932
Excuse me, good sisters,
if you will.

33:43.001 --> 33:46.198
Father, we do have a race to run,
and we're running a little late.

33:46.270 --> 33:48.761
So will you come on?
Will you excuse him, good sisters?

33:50.739 --> 33:53.574
- Bye- bye.
- Don't run off. Tonight's the night.

33:55.817 --> 33:57.750
I'd like to welcome you all...

33:57.818 --> 34:00.684
to an event that's sometimes been
called the automotive counterpart...

34:00.754 --> 34:03.221
to the Bay of Pigs.

34:03.289 --> 34:06.157
You all are certainly
the most distinguished group...

34:06.224 --> 34:09.250
of highway scofflaws and degenerates...

34:09.329 --> 34:11.388
ever gathered together
in one place.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.900
We're gonna have fun.

34:12.966 --> 34:16.493
Of course you know certain skeptics
note that perhaps 10,000...

34:16.571 --> 34:18.969
of the nation's most elite
highway patrolmen...

34:19.039 --> 34:22.601
are out there waiting for us after
we start, but let's think positively.

34:22.677 --> 34:25.876
Think of the fact that there is
not one state in the 50...

34:25.949 --> 34:28.315
that has the death penalty
for speeding.

34:28.386 --> 34:30.217
Although I'm not sure about Ohio.

34:31.422 --> 34:34.254
Everybody is gonna get
a card like this.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.886
When you leave, you're gonna
punch out here at this time clock.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.297
Three thousand miles away from here...

34:40.364 --> 34:43.300
is another time clock just like that
at the Portofino Inn.

34:43.366 --> 34:47.204
The difference between the two times
is your time across the country.

34:47.273 --> 34:51.072
The record stands
at 32 hours and 51 minutes.

34:51.145 --> 34:55.579
Believe it or not, those guys did
break the 55 mile an hour speed limit.

34:58.484 --> 35:01.978
Let's get that first car up here.
We're gonna get this thing underway.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.336
Go!

35:23.749 --> 35:26.013
- I know.
- All right. Where's the doctor?

35:26.083 --> 35:28.110
- I got everything else.
- Where's the doctor?

35:28.186 --> 35:30.486
- I got 60 gallons of gas...
- Can you read my lips?

35:30.554 --> 35:32.750
- Where is the doctor?
- The auxiliary tanks...

35:32.824 --> 35:35.316
Goddamn it, I gave you one
responsibility... to get a doctor.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.521
You give me no doctor.
Where is he?

35:37.597 --> 35:39.963
He got sick.

35:40.033 --> 35:42.661
Listen to what I'm telling you.
You go find a doctor.

35:42.735 --> 35:44.932
Get me Dr. Kildare.
Get me Dr. Livingston.

35:45.005 --> 35:46.938
Get me Dr. Frankenstein.
Just get me a doctor.

35:47.007 --> 35:49.477
- Go where the doctors hang out.
- Where is that?

35:49.541 --> 35:50.909
Bars, golf courses.

35:50.979 --> 35:53.505
Golf course, bar. All right.
Where else? Hospital!

35:53.583 --> 35:54.842
Try that too.

35:54.915 --> 35:57.714
My jet will take you to California.

35:57.786 --> 36:00.255
It's time for you to punch out.

36:03.893 --> 36:06.522
I'll see you in California!
I love you!

36:12.971 --> 36:14.905
A toast to us, you and me.

36:14.974 --> 36:17.238
- We're gonna win the whole thing.
- It's a cinch.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.608
The more I look around
and see these turkeys...

36:20.680 --> 36:22.374
I have...

36:24.784 --> 36:27.983
While you're drinking,
that truck to the left...

36:28.055 --> 36:30.581
Isn't that j.j. McClure?

36:30.657 --> 36:32.956
He's nothing.

36:33.027 --> 36:37.158
Don't worry about him.
It's the blimp next to him. The blimp.

36:37.234 --> 36:42.031
When he puts on that mask,
he'll blow your goddamn doors off.

36:42.103 --> 36:44.731
You understand that?
The blimp!

36:53.916 --> 36:55.852
Was that weird?

37:01.494 --> 37:03.754
It's a Nevada license plate...

37:03.828 --> 37:05.820
and that's...

37:05.898 --> 37:08.127
whiskey, zebra, alpha...

37:08.201 --> 37:10.635
niner, fiver, zero.

37:10.703 --> 37:12.603
- You got that?
- What?

37:13.772 --> 37:16.800
Just write W-Z-A...
No, here.

37:16.877 --> 37:21.577
Will you let me do it?
W-Z-A-9-5-0.

37:21.648 --> 37:25.779
See? Whiskey, zebra, alpha,
niner, fiver, zero.

37:31.492 --> 37:35.260
Okay, so it's Interstate 80
through Pennsylvania.

37:35.331 --> 37:39.325
Oh, that's a good looking piece.

37:39.400 --> 37:43.306
And cunningly disguised
so it won't look like a racing car.

37:43.373 --> 37:46.830
You know, the cops would never
give that a second glance.

37:46.910 --> 37:50.439
Two hundred and twenty miles an hour,
and they won't get a second glance.

37:50.515 --> 37:52.450
Hey, when we get to California...

37:52.517 --> 37:55.384
I got a place out at Palos Verdes...

37:55.455 --> 37:58.720
You boys gonna start this thing or just
sit and wait for that paint to dry?

38:00.358 --> 38:01.851
Yes, sir.

38:04.230 --> 38:06.791
- How long till we stop?
- Eight hours.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.838
Damn, I gotta go to the john.

38:17.813 --> 38:19.077
Go.

38:23.418 --> 38:26.911
Mad Dog, you are gonna take the shortcut
to the interstate, aren't you?

38:26.989 --> 38:29.151
We're here to win, ain't we?

38:29.225 --> 38:33.092
If you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly.

38:39.638 --> 38:41.571
My God, Pamela.

38:41.639 --> 38:43.575
Did you see that?

38:43.642 --> 38:48.306
They drove right through those trees.
I love trees. Did I tell you...

38:48.380 --> 38:51.508
We are going right down there and bring
this thing to a screeching halt...

38:51.583 --> 38:52.951
right now.

38:53.019 --> 38:55.352
Buckle up.
We're going into action.

38:57.725 --> 39:00.194
Would you mind?

39:00.261 --> 39:03.288
- Very civil.
- Might be easier with your lights on.

39:03.366 --> 39:05.300
Why advertise?

39:06.701 --> 39:08.898
- Wait a minute, Father.
- What?

39:08.970 --> 39:12.702
That's a no-no. Haven't you heard? They
haven't allowed that for 2,000 years.

39:12.774 --> 39:15.299
No, look. I'm a liberal wing.

39:15.377 --> 39:17.208
Way out on the other
part of the church.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.874
- It's nothing at all.
- Keep flying, Father.

39:25.191 --> 39:27.591
How about just one of you?

39:29.960 --> 39:32.328
Who says cops won't stop honeymooners?

39:32.397 --> 39:34.764
Anyhow, why do I
have to be the bride?

39:34.833 --> 39:36.770
Shut up, sweetie,
and punch the clock.

39:38.037 --> 39:41.667
- Okay, go slow until I get my wig on.
- Yes, dear.

39:44.976 --> 39:47.847
Well, old pal of mine,
are we all set for California?

39:49.250 --> 39:53.310
- Next time, Methodist. Methodist!
- All right, pal of mine.

39:53.388 --> 39:55.415
Okay, okay. You're all right.

39:55.492 --> 39:57.856
Okay, now, who's driving?

39:57.928 --> 39:59.416
- You are.
- You're driving.

39:59.494 --> 40:02.259
- I can't drive.
- Then I'm driving.

40:02.330 --> 40:03.925
Yeah, I think you are.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.864
All right.
Put me down.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.871
You hold this.
I'll get in the car.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.750
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.719
Somebody's hat!

40:27.393 --> 40:29.327
Hold my drink.

40:41.609 --> 40:42.871
Hit it!

40:49.619 --> 40:52.520
Thank you, good sisters.

40:52.589 --> 40:56.082
May the good Lord take a liking to you,
but not too soon.

40:56.158 --> 40:58.093
Bless you, my children.

40:58.162 --> 41:01.064
Those guys are more juiced up
than that Ferrari.

41:15.749 --> 41:18.183
- J. J., wait. I got the doc.
- Terrific.

41:18.253 --> 41:20.719
No, wait.
He's in the ambulance. This way.

41:22.957 --> 41:25.424
Before I open this,
don't get your hopes up too high.

41:25.494 --> 41:27.554
- I was pressed for time.
- No problem.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.257
Holy shit!

41:33.335 --> 41:35.394
I'm honored, sir.

41:35.471 --> 41:37.667
I'm Doctor Nicholas...

41:37.741 --> 41:40.733
Nickolas Van Helsing,
professor of proctology...

41:40.811 --> 41:42.745
and other related tendencies.

41:42.812 --> 41:45.281
Graduate of the University
of Rangoon...

41:45.349 --> 41:46.943
and assorted night classes...

41:47.017 --> 41:50.454
at the Knoxville, Tennessee,
College of Faith Healing.

41:50.521 --> 41:53.356
You may be a little
overqualified for this job.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.392
You got your equipment with you?

41:55.460 --> 41:57.792
I never go anywhere without it.

41:57.863 --> 42:01.321
However, in my particular line of work,
I seldom need more than this.

42:04.872 --> 42:05.838
Or this.

42:12.679 --> 42:14.409
We'll talk about this later.

42:14.483 --> 42:17.883
Now, sir, before we commence
this odyssey...

42:17.955 --> 42:20.923
which I understand will carry us
across this grand nation...

42:20.989 --> 42:22.957
from sea to shining sea...

42:23.026 --> 42:25.962
there's the matter of my compensation.

42:26.029 --> 42:28.519
I've determined that my services
will require...

42:28.598 --> 42:30.531
the payment of $2,000.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.274
I was thinking more
along the lines of $200.

42:37.342 --> 42:39.537
Fortunately...

42:39.611 --> 42:43.637
my practice allows me
a certain flexibility.

42:44.550 --> 42:48.007
After checking my schedule, I find
I'll be able to make the journey.

42:48.087 --> 42:50.680
As far as the money's concerned,
you've got a deal.

42:54.428 --> 42:56.020
We're off!

42:58.865 --> 43:00.165
Here we go.

43:00.234 --> 43:03.397
Three thousand carefree,
madcap miles to California.

43:03.471 --> 43:05.406
California, here we come

43:05.473 --> 43:07.997
Right back where we started from

43:08.075 --> 43:11.206
Thanks to you, Victor, we do not have
a female patient in the back...

43:11.280 --> 43:13.339
thanks to your wonderful Cousin Tessie.

43:13.416 --> 43:17.319
It's not my fault
that she didn't fit in the stretcher.

43:17.386 --> 43:18.876
Doesn't fit in the ambulance.

43:18.955 --> 43:21.150
I got the doc here, didn't I?

43:22.928 --> 43:27.728
Don't ever tell me where you got him.
I don't want to know where you got him.

43:27.797 --> 43:30.064
I was just surprised
that all the animals there were...

43:30.136 --> 43:32.228
I don't want to know
where you got him!

43:33.774 --> 43:35.831
Hey, maybe I could be the patient.

43:35.908 --> 43:38.709
That's a good idea.
Everybody would believe you were sick.

43:38.778 --> 43:41.679
- Don't you believe he's sick?
- Want me to examine him?

43:44.018 --> 43:46.487
Him doesn't like it
when you say bad things about me.

43:46.555 --> 43:48.819
And you know that.

43:48.890 --> 43:51.790
Thanks to you, though,
we don't have a female patient.

43:51.859 --> 43:54.954
And we've got to find a female...

43:56.631 --> 43:58.121
Damn Cannonballers.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.767
I'm so happy you're here.

44:04.839 --> 44:07.639
- Can you help me with Mr...
- Foyt.

44:07.711 --> 44:10.736
- Foyt.
- Sure. That's what I'm here for.

44:10.815 --> 44:13.683
Mr. Foyt. Go around and get in
the emergency entrance.

44:14.985 --> 44:18.319
Come on right here.
There we go. Hit it!

44:18.390 --> 44:20.552
Wait, I'm not...

44:23.028 --> 44:24.963
This is really terrific...

44:25.031 --> 44:27.590
the way you guys go around
helping people.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.692
Next year we're going
for the Nobel Prize.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.737
That's where the big bucks are.

44:35.108 --> 44:38.136
You forgot Mr... Mr...

44:40.382 --> 44:44.579
Well, we got you.
We're batting.500. Nobody's perfect.

44:44.653 --> 44:46.680
Well, I think you have to go back
and pick him up.

44:49.025 --> 44:51.857
We'd really like to,
but we're on kind a tight schedule.

44:51.928 --> 44:53.861
We're on our way to California.

44:53.931 --> 44:56.991
You'd be amazed how many
sick people there are out there.

44:57.067 --> 45:00.300
They need our help.
We could pick him up on the way back.

45:03.673 --> 45:05.938
Victor, can you help me?

45:06.010 --> 45:08.742
No, I can't.
I can't do anything.

45:08.812 --> 45:11.213
But he can.

45:11.286 --> 45:13.149
Who can?

45:13.219 --> 45:14.518
Him.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.535
Excuse me.

45:30.106 --> 45:31.505
Doctor...

45:36.812 --> 45:39.576
My God, the perfect specimen.

45:39.651 --> 45:43.105
J. J., you want me to start
the examination right away?

45:43.185 --> 45:46.120
I'm gonna like this job.
Right here, honey.

45:46.188 --> 45:48.124
No, thank you.
Not right now.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.395
Of course, man.
This took 30 years.

46:06.914 --> 46:08.711
They won't be able to see us...

46:08.781 --> 46:10.250
the son of a guns.

46:32.209 --> 46:33.904
I'm really sorry about that...

46:33.977 --> 46:35.741
little lapse, Officer.

46:35.814 --> 46:37.781
Normally I drive
right around the speed limit.

46:37.849 --> 46:42.149
We all make mistakes, miss, but 160?
That's a little more than a lapse.

46:51.664 --> 46:54.964
What the hell is going on here?
Everybody's driving like maniacs.

46:55.035 --> 46:56.502
I don't know, Officer.

46:56.570 --> 46:59.199
Let me see
your driver's license, please.

47:11.754 --> 47:14.987
What the hell. I can't penalize
nice girls like you...

47:15.059 --> 47:17.753
for a little indiscretion...

47:17.828 --> 47:20.295
with the whole road packed with
speed-crazy lunatics.

47:21.966 --> 47:24.399
Here. You girls have a nice trip.

47:24.470 --> 47:26.561
- Drive carefully and take it easy.
- Thank you.

47:26.638 --> 47:29.836
- Come back and see us next year.
- Bye.

47:31.542 --> 47:34.104
Take care.
Keep it in the road.

47:38.184 --> 47:40.153
I don't know why you're pouting.

47:40.220 --> 47:43.554
I mean, look. We're taking
a nice, leisurely trip to California.

47:43.623 --> 47:45.818
And we're picking up all the bills.
This could be fun.

47:45.891 --> 47:48.053
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

47:48.128 --> 47:50.153
This is not a joke anymore.
I'm being kidnapped.

47:50.228 --> 47:52.223
You can call it kidnapping
if you want to be rude.

47:52.301 --> 47:55.270
Just think. We have
a professional physician on board...

47:55.338 --> 47:56.964
in case somebody gets swamp fever.

47:59.641 --> 48:01.667
You guys are strange.

48:07.283 --> 48:08.841
We got company.

48:08.918 --> 48:10.683
Yeah, I hear.

48:10.755 --> 48:13.746
Okay, Beauty, you lie down
and be a patient for the police.

48:13.825 --> 48:15.848
- Come on. Why?
- Don't!

48:15.927 --> 48:18.417
I'm not gonna help you.
You didn't even help Mr...

48:21.701 --> 48:23.861
Maybe I can help.

48:24.671 --> 48:26.196
Dear God!

48:26.273 --> 48:30.002
It's all right, miss. It doesn't hurt.
Give it to myself all the time.

48:30.076 --> 48:32.069
Yeah. He gives it to himself
all the time.

48:33.847 --> 48:35.337
Show her.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.378
Come on, Doc.
Show her.

48:42.157 --> 48:43.623
Show her.

48:57.309 --> 49:00.764
There. You see?
That didn't hurt.

49:02.547 --> 49:04.447
- J.j.?
- No, thanks.

49:31.313 --> 49:33.578
Hi, guys. What's up?

49:33.649 --> 49:34.912
What's up?

49:34.985 --> 49:38.680
You guys are running at 120.
Your lights are flashing all over.

49:38.754 --> 49:41.418
- We've got a patient in there.
- You were still speeding.

49:42.493 --> 49:44.652
She's very sick.

49:44.727 --> 49:46.959
There's not a hospital within 50 miles.
Where are you headed?

49:47.031 --> 49:49.727
- UCLA.
- UCLA?

49:49.801 --> 49:52.030
- UCLA Medical Center.
- L.A.

49:52.103 --> 49:53.332
California?

49:54.673 --> 49:58.165
This is going to sound like a dumb
question, but if she's that sick...

49:58.243 --> 49:59.732
why didn't you fly her?

49:59.812 --> 50:02.440
Why didn't we fly her?

50:04.285 --> 50:07.582
I'm just the driver.
We have to ask the doc.

50:08.756 --> 50:10.553
That's a good idea.
Why don't we ask the doc?

50:14.495 --> 50:15.861
I'm sorry.

50:17.966 --> 50:21.060
What's going on out here?
What is this crude interruption?

50:26.074 --> 50:29.202
The patient... Why can't she
be flown to California?

50:29.277 --> 50:32.042
Cysts on the walls of her lungs.

50:32.115 --> 50:33.549
Very rare.

50:33.617 --> 50:35.984
You see, airplanes are only
pressurized at 10,000 feet.

50:36.053 --> 50:38.887
Anybody who knows anything
about medicine knows...

50:38.958 --> 50:41.150
that she can't fly,
she has to be driven.

50:41.227 --> 50:43.524
We couldn't even go through Denver,
it's so high.

50:43.594 --> 50:47.430
Tell them to go back
and pick up Mr...

50:49.702 --> 50:52.900
- Is that lady all right?
- She's in great pain.

50:52.974 --> 50:56.533
Causes her to make
certain delirious deliriums.

51:00.213 --> 51:01.771
Sounds like she's on something to me.

51:03.619 --> 51:06.917
Let me explain something to you.
We have to get the senator's wife...

51:06.987 --> 51:09.355
to California in 72 hours.

51:09.426 --> 51:11.119
You understand what I'm saying?

51:12.861 --> 51:14.921
We have to get the senator's wife...

51:14.996 --> 51:17.866
to California in 72 hours.

51:18.736 --> 51:19.964
We're very close.

51:21.338 --> 51:25.468
As long as you're in New jersey,
I want you fellows to take it easy.

51:25.545 --> 51:28.070
- You got that?
- We sure do.

51:29.947 --> 51:32.542
- Thanks a lot.
- Get this rig out of here.

51:35.555 --> 51:37.886
I'm glad there's no cupcakes
like that in New jersey.

51:37.957 --> 51:40.324
You haven't met
my brother-in- law Ralph.

51:49.604 --> 51:51.729
I thought that cop was gonna have
a cardiac arrest...

51:51.804 --> 51:54.037
when we said we were going
to California.

51:55.878 --> 51:57.606
Wasn't Beauty terrific?

51:57.680 --> 51:59.545
The lady was splendid.

51:59.615 --> 52:03.109
She should have her picture
on the cover of the AMAJournal.

52:08.592 --> 52:11.026
I'm sure that doctor's
a very sweet man, basically.

52:11.095 --> 52:12.188
Ah, thanks.

52:12.264 --> 52:14.858
But don't you ever tell me
where you found him.

52:14.933 --> 52:16.764
Ever.

52:16.834 --> 52:19.430
It's the Cannonball.
It's the damn Cannonball for sure.

52:19.506 --> 52:21.869
They blasted away
right in front of my eyes.

52:21.940 --> 52:24.773
And they kidnapped a girl
named Pamela Glover...

52:24.842 --> 52:27.677
just like it was the goddamn
Red Brigade or something.

52:29.015 --> 52:32.109
No, I've got them.
This time I've got them.

52:32.187 --> 52:34.916
Ohio? Yes.
Ohio has been notified.

52:36.289 --> 52:38.725
Ohio has been notified.

52:38.795 --> 52:41.558
And Missouri.
And California.

52:41.630 --> 52:44.690
We'll get them, and I'm gonna
be there to handle it.

52:45.835 --> 52:47.769
You can count on it.

52:49.872 --> 52:51.932
I've got two minutes
to catch my flight.

52:52.008 --> 52:52.941
Bye.

52:59.683 --> 53:01.549
- Madam. Madam.
- Madam?

53:01.618 --> 53:04.349
I'm no madam.
I'm a decent, respectable woman.

53:04.422 --> 53:06.617
I don't even own a house.
I live in an apartment.

53:06.692 --> 53:08.989
Now get off my case.
I'm late for my plane.

53:23.243 --> 53:26.611
- After my career in the RAF...
- The what?

53:26.681 --> 53:29.047
The Royal Air Force.

53:29.116 --> 53:32.745
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
- Please, go ahead. They're your lungs.

53:32.822 --> 53:36.018
Well, I had a chestful of citations...
medals, that sort of thing...

53:36.091 --> 53:37.890
and then I drifted in playing
a rather popular...

53:37.961 --> 53:40.256
Not that one, darling, please.

53:40.328 --> 53:43.926
We don't want you leaving so shortly
after the trip has begun, do we?

53:44.000 --> 53:46.094
No, of course not.

53:46.168 --> 53:48.400
Then I drifted into playing...

53:48.472 --> 53:51.202
a rather popular character
on a television series.

53:51.276 --> 53:53.369
It's still in syndication, you know.

53:54.647 --> 53:57.207
Puff away.

53:57.282 --> 54:00.720
Thanks a lot, ladies.
But I would take it a little easier.

54:00.787 --> 54:04.315
Some of the officers up the road
might not be as understanding.

54:04.390 --> 54:08.851
Thank you so much, Officer.
We really do appreciate that warning.

54:08.928 --> 54:10.589
And if you're ever in Duluth...

54:10.664 --> 54:12.760
remember to look me up.

54:13.967 --> 54:17.495
I got the number.
You can count on it.

54:28.885 --> 54:30.250
How's the patient?

54:34.691 --> 54:36.023
She's alive.

54:36.094 --> 54:38.890
Looks like she survived the procedure.

54:38.963 --> 54:40.363
What procedure?

54:41.099 --> 54:43.590
If you guys laid a finger on me...

54:48.341 --> 54:50.366
No, I just gave her a little prick.

54:51.878 --> 54:53.780
With this.

54:53.846 --> 54:57.407
Hey, Super Chief, will you lean forward
so I can get the front wheel down?

54:57.484 --> 54:59.417
Stop kidding. I am.

55:15.606 --> 55:19.838
Pull over!
We want to give you our blessings.

55:21.345 --> 55:23.508
There are two priests
in that car over there.

55:27.319 --> 55:29.047
They want us to pull over.

55:30.922 --> 55:32.915
They're two priests
driving a Ferrari.

55:32.991 --> 55:35.824
When's the last time you saw
two priests driving a Ferrari?

55:35.895 --> 55:37.362
Are they taking the bingo money home?

55:37.429 --> 55:39.589
Oh, no, they're doing
the work of the Lord.

55:39.664 --> 55:41.999
In a Ferrari, they can just
do it faster, that's all.

55:43.304 --> 55:44.737
Pull over!

55:46.006 --> 55:48.271
We want to bless you!

55:52.148 --> 55:54.173
One of the priests is black.

55:54.250 --> 55:57.116
- Oh, yeah. They have black priests.
- They do?

55:57.184 --> 55:59.118
Oh, sure.
They have a black cardinal.

55:59.186 --> 56:01.851
Oh, they do want us to pull over.

56:01.923 --> 56:04.189
They want to bless us.
Can we?

56:05.329 --> 56:06.854
Let me get this straight.

56:06.931 --> 56:10.093
You want us to pull over
and be blessed...

56:10.167 --> 56:12.531
by a black priest in a red Ferrari?

56:12.603 --> 56:13.534
Couldn't hurt.

56:24.784 --> 56:27.778
- Nice car, Father.
- Thank you, asshole.

56:28.989 --> 56:31.183
Hello, Father.
Nice-looking car.

56:31.258 --> 56:33.921
That's what everyone says.
He even said it.

56:33.996 --> 56:36.793
I want to thank you
for stopping, son...

56:36.864 --> 56:39.491
'cause we always stop the ambulance...

56:39.566 --> 56:41.729
so we can bless
whoever's in there...

56:41.805 --> 56:44.898
and you paramedics are doing
such a wonderful job.

56:44.975 --> 56:48.138
We're in kind of a hurry,
so just bless it and we can go.

56:50.412 --> 56:52.472
- Oh, I gotta bless her.
- I'm sorry, Father.

56:52.549 --> 56:54.744
She's a Zen Buddhist.

56:54.817 --> 56:56.375
You're not a Zen Buddhist,
so you can't bless her.

56:56.453 --> 56:59.250
We specialize in blessing Zen Buddhists.

57:07.100 --> 57:09.467
On second thought, Father,
you want to bless him?

57:09.536 --> 57:11.867
We need all the help we can get.

57:11.938 --> 57:13.495
Just give him a little shot.

57:14.906 --> 57:16.807
Thank you, Father.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.972
- You're quite welcome.
- You did a good job.

57:20.045 --> 57:21.709
Thank you.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.110
Thank you, Father.

57:27.021 --> 57:30.013
Why don't you take that piece of shit
back to the junkyard?

57:39.069 --> 57:41.299
- We got a...
- Flat.

57:41.371 --> 57:43.861
- And those priests...
- Weren't fathers.

57:43.942 --> 57:45.466
- They were...
- Mothers.

57:46.343 --> 57:47.503
Come here.

57:48.279 --> 57:50.840
Ah, shit!

57:58.023 --> 58:00.686
International film star...

58:00.758 --> 58:01.851
ruthless assassin...

58:01.928 --> 58:04.762
Casanova, poet, philosopher...

58:04.832 --> 58:07.595
You might say a legend in my own time...
in fact, you can.

58:09.437 --> 58:12.872
Not that one, darling. I'm afraid
this car is full of surprises.

58:12.939 --> 58:15.431
This is something I've noticed,
I must say.

58:15.509 --> 58:17.239
How about some champagne,
darling?

58:18.846 --> 58:20.441
Hey, little silver four-wheeler...

58:20.515 --> 58:22.609
that just flew past me
with the good-looking seat cover.

58:22.687 --> 58:27.281
Son, back that thing down.
You got smokies all over my back door.

58:27.357 --> 58:29.119
If you are referring to me...

58:29.192 --> 58:33.290
I request that you speak more clearly
in the queen's English.

58:33.364 --> 58:36.197
That is, if we are going to converse
on this wireless.

58:37.034 --> 58:38.627
Bless your heart.

58:38.703 --> 58:41.638
Cheers.
Down the hatch.

59:11.908 --> 59:13.639
What do you think you're doing?

59:14.409 --> 59:16.572
You can't come in here.
You're a man.

59:16.649 --> 59:19.845
- 7-Eleven. How can I help you?
- Pumps one and two... hit 'em.

59:19.919 --> 59:23.182
What are you, some kind of nut?
You got one unleaded and one premium.

59:24.757 --> 59:26.849
She goes both ways.

59:26.924 --> 59:30.086
The round orange moon pie with
the white hat on... he'll pay for it.

59:30.161 --> 59:32.856
I'm a doctor, and if I may be
permitted the indelicacy...

59:32.930 --> 59:34.660
you seen one,
you've seen 'em all.

59:42.942 --> 59:44.878
Come on.
A thousand miles on one wheel?

59:44.947 --> 59:47.345
We're trying to win a race,
not set a record.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.500
- Victor, what do you got?
- A lot of goodies for you guys...

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:09.663
and a Big Gulp Dr Pepper for me.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.834
I'm a pepper, you're a pepper
He's a pepper, she's a pepper

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.673
Wouldn't you like to be
a pepper too

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:17.341
- Will you get in here.
- Okay. Here you go.

01:00:25.924 --> 01:00:27.359
Officer!

01:00:31.432 --> 01:00:33.422
Do you take your law and order
in this town seriously?

01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:34.593
Are you kidding?

01:00:40.775 --> 01:00:41.866
Excuse me for asking.

01:00:41.943 --> 01:00:44.379
Greek! But...

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:46.609
Would you shut up a minute
and listen to me?

01:01:01.065 --> 01:01:03.500
Oh, by the way, Greek.

01:01:03.567 --> 01:01:07.061
What's the odds on the japanese team
not finishing?

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.733
There's gonna be a red Ferrari come
flying through here in a few seconds...

01:01:09.808 --> 01:01:12.242
and the two men driving
are responsible for the victim...

01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:13.973
lying back here
in this ambulance.

01:01:14.048 --> 01:01:17.039
- Victim?
- A flasher victim.

01:01:18.151 --> 01:01:20.246
- You want to know the worst part?
- What's that?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.584
- They're dressed as priests.
- Go on.

01:01:22.655 --> 01:01:25.649
I guess they think it's a little
kinkier, you know, dressed as priests.

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:28.526
Goddamn, that's sick.
I'll handle this.

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:31.497
Oh... one more thing.
I think they're armed.

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:36.598
Damn, I hope so.
It'll give me an excuse.

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:47.240
Flashers!

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.780
Bye- bye!

01:01:49.852 --> 01:01:52.049
J. J., you son of a...

01:01:52.122 --> 01:01:55.059
Out of the car,
both of you. Now!

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:00.897
All right, hit it.

01:02:00.966 --> 01:02:02.399
- Hit it?
- Hit it?

01:02:09.043 --> 01:02:11.102
Freeze, or name your beneficiary.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.147
Beneficiary?

01:02:13.214 --> 01:02:15.307
Officer, I sincerely hope...

01:02:15.384 --> 01:02:16.906
- you're not a Catholic.
- Pay no attention to him.

01:02:16.985 --> 01:02:19.646
He's been locked up for six years
in that monastery...

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.313
and he don't know what he's doing.

01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:23.482
I don't think both of his paddles
are in the water.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.495
Six years is gonna seem like
a summer vacation...

01:02:25.564 --> 01:02:27.494
when the state of Missouri
gets through with you.

01:02:27.564 --> 01:02:31.332
You, shorty.
Where'd you get all that jewelry?

01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:35.839
- Why'd he call me shorty?
- 'Cause you're small. Small.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.175
S-M-ALL.

01:02:39.377 --> 01:02:41.676
I suggest you take
another route, good buddy.

01:02:41.746 --> 01:02:44.011
The smokies are getting traffic
all tied up on 40...

01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:45.845
Looking for them Cannonballers.

01:02:45.918 --> 01:02:47.681
That's a big ten-four.

01:02:47.753 --> 01:02:49.187
- Hey,j.j.
- Yeah?

01:02:49.255 --> 01:02:51.952
There's a lot of talk on the CB
about the roadblock ahead.

01:02:52.025 --> 01:02:53.459
What do you think?

01:02:53.527 --> 01:02:55.621
I think we're in deep you- know-what.

01:02:55.697 --> 01:02:57.960
The transmission is slipping.

01:02:58.031 --> 01:03:00.794
And we lost a lot of time
because of your two phony priests.

01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:02.303
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:03:03.705 --> 01:03:06.038
Listen, if the transmission
does hold together...

01:03:06.107 --> 01:03:08.870
you think we're gonna be able to bluff
our way through the roadblock ahead?

01:03:08.945 --> 01:03:10.537
I don't know.

01:03:10.614 --> 01:03:12.444
Give me a minute
to gather my thoughts.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.985
I gathered my thoughts.
Hey, Lowboy!

01:03:23.059 --> 01:03:25.220
Look in your rearview mirror.

01:03:25.295 --> 01:03:27.061
You see this ambulance back here?

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:29.122
We need a piggyback ride.

01:03:30.803 --> 01:03:33.735
This one can go by.
There's no problem here.

01:03:33.805 --> 01:03:37.073
Let's just have this one and...

01:03:37.144 --> 01:03:39.236
that one.

01:03:42.314 --> 01:03:45.515
Yeah, that one's okay.
Let it go.

01:03:49.824 --> 01:03:52.849
Excuse me, but you look very familiar.
Do I know you?

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:55.022
Yes, that's quite possible.
Is this going to take long?

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:57.861
You see, we're on our honeymoon,
and she can't wait.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.594
Oh, thank God.
Normal people!

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.535
No, you see, we were just
looking for Cannon...

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:04.005
It's not important.
Just move along, if you would.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.771
- What is this, anyway?
- It's a stakeout.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.105
Oh. Bon appetit.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.538
English humor.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.785
Come on, guys,
keep moving, will you, please?

01:04:18.356 --> 01:04:19.620
Let's see...

01:04:22.695 --> 01:04:25.128
Quiet, Victor.
You're gonna blow our cover.

01:04:25.196 --> 01:04:28.133
J. J., this is not
a nine-to-five job.

01:04:28.202 --> 01:04:30.259
I wish him were here.

01:04:30.337 --> 01:04:32.134
Hi.

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:33.432
Hello.

01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:38.980
You look tired.

01:04:39.048 --> 01:04:41.241
More frustrated than tired.

01:04:41.316 --> 01:04:43.376
Think you're gonna win
this crazy race?

01:04:44.219 --> 01:04:45.620
Damn right I am.

01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:50.826
I'm sitting here having a conversation
with somebody who kidnapped me.

01:04:52.662 --> 01:04:54.927
Who can blame anybody
for kidnapping you?

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:58.029
You gave me laughing gas.

01:04:58.101 --> 01:05:01.004
Well, you have
an awful beautiful laugh.

01:05:01.671 --> 01:05:04.269
You made me forget my favorite skirt
back at the motel.

01:05:04.341 --> 01:05:07.278
Doesn't matter.
You look terrific without it.

01:05:15.756 --> 01:05:17.348
What'd you expect, anyway?

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.696
- A gang bang or something like that.
- A gang bang?

01:05:23.763 --> 01:05:25.700
We're racers, not rapists.

01:05:27.267 --> 01:05:30.033
- Why?
- Why what?

01:05:31.606 --> 01:05:35.100
Why all this speed and trouble
and risk and...

01:05:35.176 --> 01:05:37.043
I mean, what for?

01:05:37.113 --> 01:05:38.543
For the hell of it.

01:05:40.617 --> 01:05:42.607
Didn't you ever do anything
just for the hell of it?

01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:44.845
I guess so.

01:05:45.623 --> 01:05:47.887
My father used to work
in the coal mines.

01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:51.826
Forty- three years.

01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:56.662
He was gonna retire.

01:05:56.737 --> 01:05:59.170
Buy a houseboat.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.002
Move down to Florida.

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:05.410
Fish on the back of the boat
and tell my mom lies.

01:06:08.818 --> 01:06:11.148
He died two days
before he was gonna retire.

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:15.014
I guess you just never know.

01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:17.424
Yeah.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.256
I made up my mind right then.

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:23.594
I was gonna go for it...

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.156
I mean, everything I wanted...

01:06:25.235 --> 01:06:28.432
I was gonna go for it
right then...

01:06:28.504 --> 01:06:30.939
because you never know when
something's gonna happen to you.

01:06:32.343 --> 01:06:34.436
Like talking to you, you know?

01:06:35.678 --> 01:06:37.705
I mean, it's really nice.

01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:43.954
Excuse me.
Where are you guys going?

01:06:44.022 --> 01:06:47.857
We're just out
looking for a pack of cigarettes.

01:06:47.927 --> 01:06:49.791
With North Carolina plates...

01:06:49.863 --> 01:06:51.522
you're driving
to Missouri for cigarettes?

01:06:53.465 --> 01:06:54.899
How about a beer?

01:06:54.968 --> 01:06:57.732
How about the fact
that your paint job is coming off?

01:06:57.804 --> 01:07:01.640
You want to take these guys away?
The good guys strike back!

01:07:01.711 --> 01:07:04.976
What is that? Five, eight, three...
Five, eight, three, six...

01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:09.380
Hold on. Hold on.

01:07:09.451 --> 01:07:11.646
Let it go. Come on.

01:07:11.721 --> 01:07:13.813
Come on, guys, keep moving,
will you please?

01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:20.896
Howdy, sir.
What seems to be the problem?

01:07:20.964 --> 01:07:22.990
You guys didn't really think
you'd get away with this, did you?

01:07:23.068 --> 01:07:24.795
We're gonna get
the whole lot of you now.

01:07:24.868 --> 01:07:27.838
Not here, you won't. The word is out
about your little roadblock.

01:07:27.905 --> 01:07:30.397
They're talking about it
all up and down the "superslab."

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:33.839
Get these traitors out of here,
will you?

01:07:34.414 --> 01:07:36.347
Think you're so big.

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:40.681
Do some of you people want to come over
and push this thing out of the way?

01:07:40.754 --> 01:07:42.780
Come on.
I'll put it in neutral.

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.826
Who did that?
Make it stop!

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:04.708
Thanks a lot!
Keep on truckin'!

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:21.299
Hey, George, you remember the good old
days before they got radar in?

01:08:21.367 --> 01:08:22.959
We used to chase speeders?

01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:24.764
Yeah. This is really boring.

01:08:44.993 --> 01:08:46.019
Bye- bye!

01:08:46.094 --> 01:08:47.996
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know...

01:08:48.063 --> 01:08:50.294
but whatever the hell it was,
it was doing 125.

01:09:06.084 --> 01:09:08.020
That's the first time
we took an order by phone.

01:09:08.085 --> 01:09:09.518
It was hard to understand you.

01:09:09.587 --> 01:09:12.680
When I called you,
I was doing 140 miles an hour.

01:09:12.758 --> 01:09:15.024
That was six lamb burgers,
four shish kebabs...

01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:17.187
a side order of couscous...

01:09:17.261 --> 01:09:19.356
and two milk.

01:09:19.433 --> 01:09:21.265
No! How much?

01:09:21.335 --> 01:09:22.527
Six seventy- five.

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:25.540
Here, my desert blossom.

01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:27.200
Keep the change.

01:09:27.276 --> 01:09:29.765
Have you ever considered
joining a harem?

01:09:31.578 --> 01:09:34.344
I shall return for you
after the race.

01:09:42.794 --> 01:09:44.385
Get a physical.

01:09:44.461 --> 01:09:46.792
I shall return, my little fig.
I love you!

01:09:56.408 --> 01:09:59.842
I don't know
how to ask you this, but...

01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:01.675
isn't it a little strange
having that guy...

01:10:01.747 --> 01:10:04.273
running around inside your head?

01:10:04.351 --> 01:10:06.012
He's not in here.

01:10:06.086 --> 01:10:09.181
He's out there somewhere,
helping people.

01:10:09.257 --> 01:10:12.852
He's always helping people.
He'd help you.

01:10:12.927 --> 01:10:14.418
He would?

01:10:14.495 --> 01:10:16.521
He likes you.

01:10:18.766 --> 01:10:20.200
How did he find you?

01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:22.362
I mean, how did you two
get together?

01:10:22.437 --> 01:10:24.873
Well, when I was real young...

01:10:24.941 --> 01:10:27.374
I didn't have any friends
like I do now.

01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:28.876
Like j.j.

01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:31.308
Like j.j.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.213
One day I was in the schoolyard...

01:10:36.286 --> 01:10:39.313
and nine guys were beating me up
pretty good.

01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:40.825
There he was.

01:10:42.894 --> 01:10:45.556
- Captain Chaos?
- Yeah. Out of the blue!

01:10:45.631 --> 01:10:49.898
Pow! Slam! Bam! Boff!

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.000
I sure was grateful.

01:10:53.072 --> 01:10:54.335
That's great!

01:10:54.407 --> 01:10:56.898
Nobody bothered me at school
after that.

01:10:56.977 --> 01:10:58.843
I wish I had a friend
like that.

01:10:58.913 --> 01:11:01.847
Well, first you need a mask
and a cape.

01:11:02.584 --> 01:11:04.676
I think I'd like mine
to be pink.

01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:06.585
Almost everything I wear
is pink.

01:11:06.654 --> 01:11:08.746
Everything?

01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:10.655
Even...

01:11:10.726 --> 01:11:12.193
I don't wear any.

01:11:12.261 --> 01:11:13.695
You don't?

01:11:15.165 --> 01:11:16.756
Wow.

01:11:20.003 --> 01:11:21.767
I'd like to be your friend...

01:11:21.839 --> 01:11:23.863
'cause I like you.

01:11:24.844 --> 01:11:26.937
I like you too, Beauty.

01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:28.444
Thank you.

01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:43.954
New Mexico.

01:11:54.374 --> 01:11:56.810
Texas?
Stupid!

01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:28.676
I'll take care of this one.

01:12:41.329 --> 01:12:42.853
Hello, hot pants.

01:12:42.929 --> 01:12:44.866
I don't suppose
you have a driver's license...

01:12:44.934 --> 01:12:46.994
tucked down in there somewhere,
do you?

01:12:47.069 --> 01:12:48.969
Yes, Officer.

01:12:57.615 --> 01:13:00.312
That policeman seems to want us
to stop, darling.

01:13:00.387 --> 01:13:03.478
Yes. He must be rather upset
with our rapid rate.

01:13:03.556 --> 01:13:06.388
Funny. They don't have any sense
of humor about that sort of thing.

01:13:06.457 --> 01:13:07.889
Aren't you going to pull over?

01:13:07.957 --> 01:13:09.551
I'd rather not.

01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:12.893
Can be such a bore,
talking to those chaps.

01:13:12.964 --> 01:13:15.229
Tell you what.
We'll just slip away.

01:13:15.302 --> 01:13:18.397
- Hit that button, will you?
- Like in your movies!

01:13:23.778 --> 01:13:26.748
And now a little oil,
right, darling?

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:41.093
Well, well. We are full of tricks,
aren't we?

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.428
It's all part of my business,
really.

01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:46.961
I've been meaning to ask you, darling.
What movie... Wait a minute.

01:13:47.038 --> 01:13:49.905
- Can you see where you're going?
- Perfectly.

01:13:49.974 --> 01:13:52.273
This is ridiculous.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.779
It's good sport, isn't it?

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.879
Would you mind rolling
your window down, old girl?

01:14:02.956 --> 01:14:05.287
We're getting done up
like a couple of kippers here.

01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:07.452
Next time, I bring my mask.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:08.961
A foggy day in London town.

01:14:20.376 --> 01:14:22.436
You are about to witness
the ravishment...

01:14:22.512 --> 01:14:24.980
of a woman who has been abducted.

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:30.313
A woman whose initial fear
has mellowed into curious expectation.

01:14:30.388 --> 01:14:34.157
In the morning, she will be set free,
unaware of anything...

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:37.991
except that she has been loved
as never before.

01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:50.000
Oh, yes, there!

01:14:50.075 --> 01:14:51.509
Yes!

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.988
I've never seen a damn Rolls Royce
that'd do 140 miles an hour.

01:15:07.063 --> 01:15:08.690
What do you fellas got
in that thing?

01:15:08.763 --> 01:15:11.027
- Stock.
- Sign here.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.195
I guess you must have misconstrued
my remark...

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:16.171
about my mother planning to purchase
Southern California...

01:15:16.238 --> 01:15:19.138
as an attempt to influence
your giving me a ticket, Officer.

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:22.771
I am sure that she will still
consider keeping you all on...

01:15:22.847 --> 01:15:25.281
as a member of the Highway Patrol,
regardless...

01:15:25.351 --> 01:15:27.009
of how shabbily
you treated her son.

01:15:27.784 --> 01:15:29.845
You might want to tell that
to the judge, sir.

01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:44.203
This is for you and the judge!

01:15:44.271 --> 01:15:46.242
Goddamn camel jockey.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.910
Oh, shit.
We got a smokey on our tail.

01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:00.682
Watch this.

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:04.687
- Officer.
- Pull it over.

01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:07.423
We got no brakes!
No brakes!

01:16:07.497 --> 01:16:09.489
Help us!
Yes, thank you!

01:16:09.567 --> 01:16:11.591
Damn "no brake" gag
works every time.

01:16:14.406 --> 01:16:17.671
Oh, no!
We really don't have any brakes!

01:16:17.742 --> 01:16:19.869
- Quit kidding, will you?
- Hang on!

01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:30.281
Evel Knievel...

01:16:30.355 --> 01:16:33.758
you've got yourself
some competition.

01:17:41.938 --> 01:17:43.370
Secret weapon.

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:04.325
Ready, fire!

01:18:19.714 --> 01:18:21.147
How long we been here?

01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:24.716
Twenty minutes.
We could have been there by now.

01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:27.153
We're gonna be open
in five minutes, Father.

01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:39.229
Father Putz.

01:18:40.239 --> 01:18:42.140
Albert Schweitzer!

01:18:42.205 --> 01:18:45.608
I want to thank you for being
so sweet and so nice...

01:18:45.678 --> 01:18:49.513
and telling those people all about us
back in Missouri...

01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:53.452
that we were both flashers
and sex maniacs.

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:58.556
Well, I just
wanted to return the favor...

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:01.459
that you and the chocolate monk
did for us back in Ohio.

01:19:02.531 --> 01:19:04.464
"The chocolate monk"?

01:19:07.769 --> 01:19:09.863
He could say that.

01:19:09.939 --> 01:19:14.035
He could say it 'cause he's riding
around with the Goodyear blimp.

01:19:14.611 --> 01:19:15.703
"The Goodyear blimp"?

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.043
- He can say that.
- Yeah, I can say that.

01:19:18.115 --> 01:19:20.709
Because if I had the time...

01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:24.516
I would take those rosary beads
and stuff'em up your nose.

01:19:24.587 --> 01:19:25.887
- These rosary beads?
- Yeah.

01:19:25.957 --> 01:19:28.391
My rosary beads?
You're gonna shove 'em up this nose?

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:30.053
Up that nose, yeah.

01:19:32.131 --> 01:19:34.222
- He can do that.
- He can do that.

01:19:35.299 --> 01:19:37.394
- You take a little advice?
- Sure.

01:19:38.804 --> 01:19:40.500
Bring friends.

01:19:45.545 --> 01:19:47.569
A lot of them.

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:54.180
He wants me to bring...

01:19:56.257 --> 01:19:57.452
Blimp?

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:14.974
Ah. The bride and groom
Cannonballer.

01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:17.209
I told you this honeymoon scheme
would work.

01:20:17.283 --> 01:20:19.513
Good. Now you wear the wig,
sweetheart.

01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.552
- It's hot.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:20:21.621 --> 01:20:24.383
When I was in Egypt making
The Fly Who Bugged Me...

01:20:24.456 --> 01:20:27.985
it was at least 180 in the shade...
not that there was much shade.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.224
If CBS would have
had their cameras there...

01:20:30.297 --> 01:20:32.232
we'd have made Sports Spectacular
for sure.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.888
We just zoomed right out
over that train.

01:20:33.968 --> 01:20:35.629
What, do you want
to try it again?

01:20:57.096 --> 01:20:58.527
All right!

01:21:00.098 --> 01:21:03.193
Don't you look precious,
all dressed up like that.

01:21:03.268 --> 01:21:06.534
And wearing a wig too.
Ain't he cute?

01:21:06.606 --> 01:21:08.938
Those guys scare me.

01:21:09.007 --> 01:21:11.874
You just stay close to Moore.
There won't be any trouble.

01:21:12.847 --> 01:21:15.076
He looks like Gregory Peck
in that blue flannel suit.

01:21:19.355 --> 01:21:21.114
This is my friend Shakey.

01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:22.778
Allow me to present myself.

01:21:22.856 --> 01:21:24.917
I'm on Wall Street.
Maybe we can have lunch sometime.

01:21:25.694 --> 01:21:27.958
We don't ride on Wall Street.

01:21:28.029 --> 01:21:30.430
Nah, we don't ride on Wall Street.

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:33.467
- Why don't we go over and help 'em out?
- What do you mean "we"?

01:21:33.535 --> 01:21:37.473
If we do, then that road opens up
and you're long gone.

01:21:37.539 --> 01:21:39.406
Now, why don't you?

01:21:39.474 --> 01:21:41.810
You're the Good Samaritan.

01:21:43.045 --> 01:21:44.571
Besides, I'm wearing these.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:47.379
Maybe you would like
to complete your ensemble.

01:21:47.453 --> 01:21:49.475
Oh, no. There's something else
of yours that I want.

01:21:49.553 --> 01:21:51.146
Oh, really? What's that?

01:21:51.222 --> 01:21:52.587
Your ass!

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.102
Oh, shit.

01:22:05.173 --> 01:22:07.163
Well, shall we join the fracas?

01:22:25.927 --> 01:22:27.363
Step back, my dear.

01:22:28.431 --> 01:22:30.492
I must warn you,
I'm Roger Moore.

01:22:30.569 --> 01:22:33.197
- Who?
- Roger Moore.

01:22:36.741 --> 01:22:38.369
We'll run in there.

01:22:40.447 --> 01:22:42.036
Knock 'em flat out.

01:22:42.112 --> 01:22:45.106
- Then we go. We could still win it.
- We can do that.

01:22:45.184 --> 01:22:47.048
- We can do that. Yeah.
- We can do that.

01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:54.159
You'll be sorry!
Let me down!

01:22:57.063 --> 01:22:58.498
Take that!

01:23:10.478 --> 01:23:12.310
You're so macho.

01:23:12.381 --> 01:23:13.815
Watch this.

01:23:24.327 --> 01:23:25.852
Need some help, Father?

01:23:29.835 --> 01:23:31.233
Give me somebody!

01:23:32.305 --> 01:23:34.273
What, are you crazy, Greek?

01:23:34.339 --> 01:23:37.502
How could you possibly change odds
in the middle of things?

01:23:39.677 --> 01:23:43.878
Hold it. You wouldn't last five minutes
in the New York subway.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.414
That's the way it's done.

01:23:56.298 --> 01:23:59.463
- Is that good to drink?
- I don't know. I never tried it.

01:24:11.716 --> 01:24:13.980
Hold it, hold it.
You wanna try this side?

01:24:14.052 --> 01:24:15.485
Yeah.

01:24:18.558 --> 01:24:20.320
Need some help?

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.153
- Will you get out of here?
- Right!

01:24:32.073 --> 01:24:33.062
Thanks, Shakey.
Excuse me.

01:24:33.574 --> 01:24:35.336
Get this guy, Shakey!

01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:40.178
Excuse me, Father,
but the road's open.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:41.680
Oh, thanks.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.509
The road's open!

01:24:49.091 --> 01:24:50.320
Bye.

01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:59.962
Let's go! Hit it!

01:25:57.102 --> 01:25:59.160
- Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
- I'm trying.

01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:02.207
- Come on, faster!
- Drive it like Captain Chaos would.

01:26:02.373 --> 01:26:03.535
I'll try.

01:26:03.609 --> 01:26:05.201
What'd you take off
that goddamn mask for?

01:26:05.278 --> 01:26:07.179
I didn't take off the mask.
He took off the mask.

01:26:18.992 --> 01:26:20.790
- We need him, Victor!
- I don't know where he is.

01:26:20.862 --> 01:26:23.854
Very interesting fellow.
I'd like to probe his case.

01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:26.299
I don't believe this shit.
We don't want him around, he's around.

01:26:26.369 --> 01:26:28.803
When we want him, he's not around.
I'm gonna get a beer.

01:27:03.012 --> 01:27:05.103
It's only ten blocks to the finish.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:09.084
I feel very confident
that we will be triumphant.

01:27:25.102 --> 01:27:27.698
- What the hell was that?
- A Lamborghini.

01:27:27.773 --> 01:27:30.503
- She in the race?
- Catch it!

01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:37.213
Will you go faster!
Come on!

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:42.386
I've seen every single one of your
movies at least three or four times.

01:27:42.454 --> 01:27:43.819
Four times?

01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:47.620
- I think we've got it goin', baby.
- Yeah, we're looking good.

01:27:47.694 --> 01:27:49.823
Greek's gonna pay us money!

01:27:49.899 --> 01:27:51.888
Gosh! Wait'll I tell my friends...

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:55.733
I was sitting
next to George Hamilton!

01:27:55.805 --> 01:27:58.204
George Hamilton?

01:28:02.912 --> 01:28:04.311
- We got 'em!
- We got 'em!

01:28:11.222 --> 01:28:12.883
Look out!

01:28:14.192 --> 01:28:15.819
It's a foot race!

01:28:15.895 --> 01:28:17.760
- I've got the card...
- No, give me that, Doc.

01:28:17.831 --> 01:28:19.822
Come on!
It's a foot race!

01:28:19.899 --> 01:28:21.992
Have no fear!
Chaos is here!

01:28:24.237 --> 01:28:26.637
Take it and win, Captain!

01:28:31.477 --> 01:28:33.174
Anyone need medical attention?

01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.813
Go! Go, Chaos!

01:28:39.187 --> 01:28:40.621
We're gonna win!

01:28:40.687 --> 01:28:43.179
It's not a sporting way to win.
What do you say, Father?

01:28:43.258 --> 01:28:45.351
No, it's not a sporting way,
it's a shitty way to win.

01:28:47.997 --> 01:28:51.024
We won!
We're gonna win!

01:28:51.601 --> 01:28:55.038
Help! Help! Somebody save my baby!
He's drowning!

01:28:59.342 --> 01:29:01.538
No problem, fair lady.
I will save your baby.

01:29:01.612 --> 01:29:03.775
Have no fear!

01:29:10.691 --> 01:29:12.715
Oh, my baby, my baby.

01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:15.556
Thank you.
You're such a brave man.

01:29:15.628 --> 01:29:17.894
You don't know
what this means to me.

01:29:17.965 --> 01:29:20.899
Oh, my baby, I love you.

01:29:20.968 --> 01:29:24.564
J. J., I saved that woman's dog.

01:29:26.308 --> 01:29:28.870
Victor, we could have won
that race.

01:29:28.944 --> 01:29:30.410
You understand what I'm telling you?
We could have won!

01:29:30.479 --> 01:29:31.911
You understand that?

01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:34.245
You had to go
pull that stupid stunt.

01:29:34.317 --> 01:29:35.908
He's right, Victor.

01:29:35.983 --> 01:29:38.250
We are sick of Captain Chaos.

01:29:38.323 --> 01:29:41.087
We are so sick of Captain Chaos
we could throw up.

01:29:41.158 --> 01:29:42.752
So you know what, Victor?

01:29:42.827 --> 01:29:44.762
There's not gonna be any more
Captain Chaos.

01:29:44.829 --> 01:29:48.093
No more!
You see what I'm telling you?

01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:52.398
No more Captain Chaos!

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:53.871
Now, what do you think of that?

01:29:57.876 --> 01:30:00.970
I don't care, because...

01:30:02.249 --> 01:30:04.717
I've always wanted to be...

01:30:04.783 --> 01:30:06.616
Captain USA!

01:30:11.358 --> 01:30:14.555
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

01:30:27.143 --> 01:30:29.840
- Who won the race?
- What do you get for last?

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.553
How do you all feel, now that
you have raped the American highways?

01:30:39.623 --> 01:30:41.216
- Beautiful. Wonderful.
- Great.

01:30:41.291 --> 01:30:43.592
Old chap, I suggest
you get a grip on yourself...

01:30:43.662 --> 01:30:45.925
or better, on one of these.

01:30:45.998 --> 01:30:47.430
I'll take anything.

01:30:47.499 --> 01:30:51.232
And feel free to use the lighter
in my car, Mr...

01:30:51.302 --> 01:30:52.737
Foyt.

01:30:54.942 --> 01:30:57.637
You wait till he touches
that lighter.

01:31:04.118 --> 01:31:05.280
Ain't nothin' happening.

01:31:08.021 --> 01:31:09.454
That's funny.

01:31:09.525 --> 01:31:11.188
Excuse me.

01:31:14.695 --> 01:31:18.463
Mr. Foyt,
how did you light that?

01:31:18.536 --> 01:31:20.469
Well, with the lighter,
of course.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.405
That's odd.

01:31:34.887 --> 01:31:37.481
I've got a feeling
next year we'll do this again.

01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:43.992
J. J., didn't we do good?

01:32:18.603 --> 01:32:20.196
- Stop it.
- Ready?

01:32:24.277 --> 01:32:27.211
- Stop it!
- Okay. Okay.

01:32:30.618 --> 01:32:32.209
Wait a minute. I got something.

01:32:32.286 --> 01:32:34.219
No, this will help.

01:32:34.286 --> 01:32:38.384
I'm not gonna hit you.

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.225
Listen to me. I swear to God.

01:32:40.297 --> 01:32:42.728
I'm not gonna hit you. Watch. Watch.

01:32:45.466 --> 01:32:48.063
Okay, I'm ready now.

01:32:48.138 --> 01:32:49.399
Here we go.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.512
Look at that shit.

01:32:59.919 --> 01:33:02.113
I'm ready, I'm ready.
I swear to God, I'm ready.

01:33:02.186 --> 01:33:03.620
We're off.

01:33:09.328 --> 01:33:10.761
Where's he gonna sit?

01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:19.434
I warned you not to interfere
in my affairs.

01:33:19.507 --> 01:33:22.600
Steven, put away. Seymour. Excuse me.

01:33:22.675 --> 01:33:25.440
That's all right.
I'll answer to anything.

01:33:25.512 --> 01:33:28.609
You see, even in the deepest
family relations...

01:33:30.853 --> 01:33:32.787
My business is not worth a...

01:33:35.525 --> 01:33:36.581
Thank you, Victor.

01:33:38.194 --> 01:33:40.287
As you probably know, we're...

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:41.954
we're the favorites to...

01:33:42.031 --> 01:33:43.792
be the winning racers tomorrow...

01:33:43.867 --> 01:33:45.130
in the Cannonball...

01:33:45.201 --> 01:33:48.603
Race, which is gonna be poured...

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.635
Good evening, ladies.

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:51.801
- Evening.
- Hello.

01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:54.743
My name is j.j. McClure,
and this is my...

01:33:57.549 --> 01:33:59.574
Next year we're going for the...

01:33:59.651 --> 01:34:01.086
Yes?

01:34:08.061 --> 01:34:09.824
Perfect. Perfect.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.130
Better than...

01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:16.670
We have to get this woman...

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.329
the senator's wife...

01:34:18.405 --> 01:34:19.999
to Philadelphia by...

01:34:20.076 --> 01:34:21.838
Make that California, will you?

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.515
We're very close.

01:34:34.659 --> 01:34:36.855
Because if I had enough time...

01:34:36.928 --> 01:34:38.188
I would take those rosary bleeds...

01:34:38.262 --> 01:34:40.697
and stuff'em up your nose.

01:34:40.765 --> 01:34:43.359
- These bleeds?
- Those bleeds, yeah.

01:34:43.434 --> 01:34:45.028
You're gonna take these...

01:34:45.103 --> 01:34:48.006
- and shove 'em up my nose?
- I'd take these bleeds here...

01:34:49.075 --> 01:34:50.508
I don't care...

01:34:54.881 --> 01:34:56.817
- I don't care...
- Stop laughing!

01:34:58.052 --> 01:34:59.642
I don't care, because...

01:35:01.324 --> 01:35:02.788
You're gonna get slapped.

01:35:02.858 --> 01:35:04.822
I always wanted to be...

01:35:04.892 --> 01:35:06.328
Captain America!

01:35:10.632 --> 01:35:12.067
It's a living.

01:35:13.802 --> 01:35:15.896
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:20.408
He laughed... He laughed first.

01:35:20.477 --> 01:35:22.411
Mr. Martin laughed first.

01:35:25.317 --> 01:35:27.251
Why were you laughing?

01:35:27.318 --> 01:35:29.411
He laughed and you hit me!
