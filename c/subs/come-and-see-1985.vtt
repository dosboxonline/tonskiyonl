00:13.180 --> 00:16.428
Are you crazy? What the shit?

00:18.971 --> 00:21.010
What the hell are you doing?

00:23.596 --> 00:25.007
You playing games?

00:28.180 --> 00:30.218
Who are you playing with?

00:32.596 --> 00:36.638
With whom? You're digging?

00:39.221 --> 00:40.929
You're digging again!

00:42.846 --> 00:46.888
All right, go on digging, bastards!

00:47.555 --> 00:49.593
You goddamn bastards!

00:52.388 --> 00:53.846
So you are hiding?

00:57.346 --> 00:59.255
But you can't hide anymore!

01:01.930 --> 01:05.877
They'll find you even underground.
They'll get you!

01:07.846 --> 01:11.295
Come out! Do as I told you!

01:14.055 --> 01:15.465
Come on, get out!

01:19.138 --> 01:20.383
It's you I'm talking to!

01:23.388 --> 01:30.132
Do this, do that!
Wipe your ass with your fingers!

01:30.596 --> 01:36.630
Ordering me around like
another Flemish idiot!

01:37.180 --> 01:40.344
That's what I used to be,
now I'm a German idiot!

01:41.263 --> 01:42.840
We'll see about this.

01:43.055 --> 01:46.552
You won't obey your uncle,
you'll obey a strong stick!

01:49.846 --> 01:51.221
Get up!

01:53.971 --> 01:59.128
They're hiding, shitting cans!

01:59.346 --> 02:01.883
The pioneers of hiding!

02:02.096 --> 02:05.428
You're only good for one thing:
milking goats or slopping pigs!

02:05.846 --> 02:11.263
You laughing? You won't laugh for long.

02:12.721 --> 02:15.804
Enough! The good times are over.

02:16.013 --> 02:18.301
You'll learn your lesson!

02:18.513 --> 02:23.136
What are you sitting here for?
Go work, or I fuck your mutter!

02:28.388 --> 02:33.130
Byelorussia, 1943

02:54.638 --> 02:58.763
Go on, dig! Without any guns,
they won't let us join.

03:38.805 --> 03:42.586
Nothing around here.

03:44.513 --> 03:47.595
And where have I got mine?
I didn't buy it in a store.

03:48.805 --> 03:51.555
It's not for me you're digging.
I'm ready to go!

03:54.263 --> 03:55.840
Hello? Is this Berlin?

05:02.763 --> 05:07.220
So, you did it? Your pants are full, right?

05:40.596 --> 05:42.173
What did I tell you?

06:21.471 --> 06:28.464
COME AND SEE

07:41.555 --> 07:44.803
Music by Mozart was used in the film

08:07.221 --> 08:08.632
Oh, sonny...

08:14.596 --> 08:16.090
Oh, sonny...

08:19.888 --> 08:22.887
How will you explain it to your
dad when he returns?

08:24.930 --> 08:28.427
He will come back and find nobody here.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.304
Have pity on yourself.

08:38.096 --> 08:40.503
If you can't have any pity for me,
then have pity for them.

08:41.930 --> 08:45.759
For the love of God...

08:50.846 --> 08:52.719
Have you no heart?

08:54.346 --> 08:58.293
Stop talking like that, mom.
They're all going, I can't stay here.

09:12.138 --> 09:13.336
What are you doing?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.170
Then kill all of us, right now. Why wait?

09:17.763 --> 09:22.505
Go on, kill them! Kill all of us!

09:54.596 --> 09:57.928
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going!

10:27.471 --> 10:30.305
Mother!

10:42.055 --> 10:45.255
Hello there. Or should I say good morning?

10:47.638 --> 10:50.969
Right. Your weapon, where is it?

10:53.430 --> 10:55.670
- Where's your weapon?
- It's right here.

11:09.513 --> 11:13.970
And who are these two? Twins?

11:14.971 --> 11:16.216
That's right, twins.

11:18.096 --> 11:19.590
Out of the same litter.

11:24.513 --> 11:25.628
The sun's nearly up.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.301
Shall we go?

11:30.846 --> 11:34.260
Not yet. When they put the cows out.

11:35.263 --> 11:36.887
We want a crowd to watch.

11:37.096 --> 11:40.510
Take these, sonny. They will make you warm.

11:40.721 --> 11:42.594
With us, he'll stay warm.

11:42.930 --> 11:47.055
Don't you worry,
we'll see that he's alright.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.881
He'll be like in a pioneer camp.

11:51.513 --> 11:55.045
Buttermilk... Take what you like.

12:11.638 --> 12:13.677
Got something stronger?
Milk with a little kick?

12:17.221 --> 12:18.845
If I'd known you wanted to drink...

12:19.055 --> 12:23.180
We never do. Only on holidays.

12:23.555 --> 12:25.926
And at funerals.

12:29.805 --> 12:34.179
We maintain discipline. Our commander
is a career officer.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.679
Kossatch! That's the man, alright.

12:37.888 --> 12:42.842
You come too close, he'll make you go
away. You go away, he'll get you.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.759
- Remember Bobok?
- What Bobok?

12:46.971 --> 12:48.513
The one who was half deaf.

12:49.430 --> 12:54.846
He wanted to sleep on guard duty.
Kossatch didn't bother to wake him up.

12:55.055 --> 12:56.051
Enough of that!

12:57.430 --> 12:58.888
Woke up or didn't, it doesn't matter.

13:11.638 --> 13:12.634
Makes you laugh, eh?

13:19.805 --> 13:23.385
Women here like to sleep late.
Why are you standing? Sit down!

13:23.596 --> 13:28.669
We don't have time to sit here.
If they catch us, that'll be the end.

13:30.971 --> 13:35.048
One day I was sitting so good
that now I never sit down.

13:36.388 --> 13:40.299
Know what I mean, mother?
A shrapnel, as big as a fist!

13:40.888 --> 13:44.753
You may laugh, but it was right here.

13:44.971 --> 13:46.299
What's the matter with those cows?

13:46.596 --> 13:48.920
A couple of rounds in the air
would wake them.

13:51.805 --> 13:53.595
Women! Get'em out!

13:54.971 --> 13:56.797
Alright, let's go!

13:58.596 --> 14:00.967
Why are you taking him away?

14:01.721 --> 14:03.049
Get a good breath of air.

14:04.513 --> 14:06.884
Milked or not, get'em out!

14:08.055 --> 14:09.881
Where are you taking him?

14:10.388 --> 14:16.421
He's a good boy, he hurts nobody!

14:16.638 --> 14:18.962
He's always polite!

14:19.180 --> 14:22.760
Good people! Who could throw
a stone at such a boy?!

14:25.430 --> 14:27.966
- What are you doing?
- Keep your hands off!

14:35.055 --> 14:38.137
Come, say goodbye to your brother.

14:38.805 --> 14:41.010
Here, hold the bird. And don't move!

14:57.971 --> 14:59.382
Out of the way!

15:01.888 --> 15:03.216
Out of the way!

15:06.221 --> 15:07.466
Look.

15:08.055 --> 15:10.674
It's Yustin, mayor of the village. Idiot!

15:12.638 --> 15:14.180
I don't understand.

15:16.555 --> 15:20.502
My little Fliora! My son!

15:28.971 --> 15:30.299
My son!

15:52.055 --> 15:53.134
Hello, everybody!

16:28.763 --> 16:30.008
Hello.

16:31.013 --> 16:33.170
Just keep going, lad, keep going.

16:33.388 --> 16:35.593
Why rip it off with the skin?

16:43.346 --> 16:45.836
What are you doing? I'm still alive!

16:54.013 --> 16:57.095
Nurse, water...

17:02.971 --> 17:04.134
Hello.

17:09.555 --> 17:10.551
Go on, move!

17:15.888 --> 17:18.757
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:26.055 --> 17:27.465
Who is the last one?

17:28.055 --> 17:30.093
Don't sit in the Major's chair!

17:41.013 --> 17:42.555
All of you, shut up!

17:48.971 --> 17:55.254
Close up a little! And you, look forward!

17:57.221 --> 18:01.263
What's that? You call it your face?
Look at your comrade's face!

18:02.096 --> 18:06.221
Ah, what a suit! Over here.

18:06.471 --> 18:08.131
You'll lie down right here.

18:11.305 --> 18:14.718
Like that. Don't take your suit off yet.

18:20.221 --> 18:21.798
Hey, you cow!

18:22.013 --> 18:25.047
WE'D RATHER EAT YOU
THAN LET THE ENEMY GET YOU

18:25.888 --> 18:28.424
Make room for the cow!

18:30.721 --> 18:32.927
Hurry up, Perekhod! We ain't got all day!

18:33.180 --> 18:38.134
I've got only one sheet of film.
This is the last one, so hold it.

18:40.888 --> 18:43.673
Our father is here!

18:47.138 --> 18:49.011
Quiet down! I'm ready.

18:49.221 --> 18:52.919
Look at this man. He put on
a new suit and he stays still.

18:53.805 --> 18:56.129
Let's make a trade.
I took it from a live guy.

18:57.888 --> 19:01.337
Ah, our Chief. Welcome, Comrade.

19:12.471 --> 19:14.262
Will you give us a picture?

19:15.430 --> 19:20.171
Rise up, our country wide and great,

19:21.346 --> 19:25.211
Rise up for a deadly fight

19:27.221 --> 19:31.714
With fascists daring to invade,

19:32.888 --> 19:36.669
With black hordes of the night.

19:38.596 --> 19:43.420
Let our noble wrath swell on,

19:44.013 --> 19:48.138
Like a big and surging wave.

19:49.638 --> 19:54.545
The people's war is going on,

19:55.638 --> 19:59.301
Our sacred war of faith.

20:20.263 --> 20:21.342
Who is there?

20:24.888 --> 20:25.884
Password.

20:28.596 --> 20:29.759
Password!

20:41.305 --> 20:44.387
- Are you new?
- Yeah.

20:44.596 --> 20:47.928
- Your name?
- Gaishoun. Third squad.

20:48.930 --> 20:51.680
- Why didn't you shoot?
- I recognized you, Comrade Commander.

20:53.596 --> 20:57.721
Whenever a man doesn't stop or say
the password, shoot!

20:58.138 --> 20:59.134
Yes, only...

20:59.346 --> 21:03.128
No excuses. Extra duty as a punishment.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.508
Thanks.

21:24.346 --> 21:27.262
- Where is he?
- Who? Password!

21:27.471 --> 21:31.052
- Where'd he go?
- Password, I said!

21:46.388 --> 21:48.095
That damned owl again!

21:51.763 --> 21:53.885
Go to sleep. Your watch is up.

21:57.221 --> 22:02.508
...in the immediate proximity
of the enemy...

22:02.721 --> 22:05.424
are fulfilling their duty day and night...

23:10.138 --> 23:15.211
And today I got two notes,

23:16.305 --> 23:18.877
Very cryptically drawn.

23:20.388 --> 23:25.295
Every line contained just dots,

23:25.513 --> 23:28.595
For me to guess it on my own.

23:29.180 --> 23:35.213
How am I to find What is on his mind...

23:42.805 --> 23:44.298
Ivan, come here!

23:51.930 --> 23:57.168
I'm going to tell you the truth.
This will be a hard time for us.

23:58.263 --> 24:03.419
Old partisans know only too well
what a siege means.

24:04.138 --> 24:07.587
It means Hitler's "all-out war".

24:08.388 --> 24:11.138
His objective is to exterminate all of us.

24:11.721 --> 24:16.261
Our duty is to defend to the end
every territory

24:17.263 --> 24:20.630
that the High Command
has put into our hands.

24:21.930 --> 24:25.296
But the situation is complicated,

24:25.846 --> 24:27.637
and it's going to change every moment.

24:28.471 --> 24:31.008
So we must be vigilant.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.254
You have a weapon in your hands
and a head on your shoulders.

24:36.888 --> 24:39.970
Or, as our Commander says,

24:40.596 --> 24:44.543
to live and never say "What the heck"
is not my way.

24:47.555 --> 24:49.760
I've said it before, I'll say it again:

24:51.055 --> 24:55.180
A partisan never asks how many
fascists are there?

24:56.638 --> 24:59.471
No. He asks, "Where are the fascists?"

25:00.680 --> 25:06.013
Well, right now, they are here,
on our soil.

25:09.096 --> 25:13.636
Every one of you helps decide

25:14.013 --> 25:18.506
how long this war will last.

25:20.888 --> 25:22.761
We won't have any cowards here.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.508
Not one of you is going to be a coward.

25:29.388 --> 25:32.387
Their main weapon is fear.

25:34.180 --> 25:40.711
They want to make slaves of you,
just bugs, to crush you down.

25:43.013 --> 25:47.920
They're the ones who are going
to be scared of us! No mercy to them!

25:49.263 --> 25:50.970
They don't deserve any.

25:51.596 --> 25:55.721
We'll all be asked one day
what we did here.

25:58.638 --> 26:03.971
Any wounded or sick?
Any who can't march alone?

26:05.513 --> 26:07.304
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

26:08.013 --> 26:12.138
We have to organize a reserve
station in any case.

26:13.138 --> 26:16.054
- No wounded or sick!
- No one playing tricks!

26:16.805 --> 26:22.138
You see, my boots are no good at all.

26:26.513 --> 26:29.678
Swap boots with the new one.
He's staying behind.

26:33.971 --> 26:39.838
All sections, by fours, fall in
and follow me, forward march!

26:42.055 --> 26:43.548
Move it! Move it!

26:44.305 --> 26:48.963
You heard the commander? Come on, sit down.

27:02.096 --> 27:05.629
Let's go, men! Don't fall behind!

30:08.888 --> 30:10.512
What's your name?

30:11.763 --> 30:12.759
Fliora.

30:12.971 --> 30:14.134
And your first name?

30:14.388 --> 30:19.093
That's it, Fliora. Florian. And yours?

30:20.638 --> 30:25.592
Rose. Rose of the kolkhoze!
Ever hear that one?

30:26.721 --> 30:29.176
Tell me, how did you get here?

30:30.430 --> 30:32.919
They deported me to Germany. But here I am!

30:33.138 --> 30:35.011
They rescued you? Kossatch did?

30:37.888 --> 30:42.096
I want to ask you, Rose, you were
all dressed up over there. Why?

30:47.263 --> 30:48.543
Where was that?

30:49.430 --> 30:55.842
This morning, in front of the men.
I couldn't get it, Rose, really.

31:08.638 --> 31:12.846
My name is Glasha. Glafira.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.835
You understand now, idiot?

31:17.055 --> 31:22.045
- What's wrong?
- And what's wrong with you? Fliora!

31:25.721 --> 31:27.512
Just exactly what are you doing here?

31:29.805 --> 31:33.586
What, they took pity on the little
one, leaving you here?

31:35.471 --> 31:37.428
Kossatch took pity on you?

31:38.596 --> 31:39.592
Pity?

31:39.805 --> 31:41.678
Yes, pity!

31:42.555 --> 31:44.593
They'll be lucky if I take pity on them!

31:47.180 --> 31:50.095
He can pity, yes, he can.

31:53.596 --> 31:55.884
Only it makes him cry in his sleep.

31:56.096 --> 31:58.135
Kossatch? Cries in his sleep?

31:59.138 --> 32:03.713
He won't last long. I'm telling you that.

32:04.513 --> 32:08.294
You're lying! Filthy liar!

32:13.305 --> 32:14.384
Liar!

32:38.221 --> 32:40.509
Why don't you say something?

32:44.721 --> 32:47.471
Why won't you see me?

32:50.096 --> 32:51.720
I'm right here...

32:54.888 --> 32:56.761
I exist...

33:00.013 --> 33:01.341
Here I am.

33:04.096 --> 33:10.011
You're not living.
You don't hear birds singing.

33:12.846 --> 33:16.544
You're deaf and blind.

33:20.388 --> 33:24.596
Here I am... here...

33:28.638 --> 33:31.044
I want to love.

33:32.971 --> 33:37.381
I want to have children... Do you hear?

33:40.471 --> 33:46.386
I can do anything for you, anything!

33:49.638 --> 33:52.471
Do you want me to get blown up?

33:55.055 --> 33:56.051
Don't do that.

34:10.221 --> 34:14.168
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

34:15.513 --> 34:21.297
I'm carrying 60 ammunition rounds,
a grenade, an automatic rifle.

34:21.513 --> 34:26.053
I'm here to fight,
and you treat me like an imbecile.

34:26.805 --> 34:29.259
Kossatch! I'm not Kossatch!

34:29.596 --> 34:31.173
Are you crazy or what?

34:38.888 --> 34:40.051
What are you doing?

34:42.680 --> 34:43.842
What's got into you?

34:48.346 --> 34:52.886
Fliora, Fliora, little silly Fliora!

34:56.138 --> 34:57.929
Did I shock you, boy?

34:58.138 --> 34:59.134
Not again!

35:00.846 --> 35:02.091
Don't be angry.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.009
Are you starting again?

35:09.930 --> 35:11.128
What's that?

35:11.846 --> 35:16.339
It must be the beavers howling.
I guess, I broke their dam.

35:20.096 --> 35:22.053
Everybody's howling today.

35:30.013 --> 35:31.009
Look.

35:35.221 --> 35:37.676
That's the one that's always flying.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.966
- Want me to shoot it down?
- Hey, don't! Give it back!

36:01.096 --> 36:02.092
One...

36:02.971 --> 36:05.295
Two, three...

37:53.388 --> 37:54.467
Glasha...

38:00.096 --> 38:01.176
Glasha.

38:37.221 --> 38:39.012
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

40:34.596 --> 40:37.263
Glasha.

41:23.055 --> 41:25.177
Tomorrow, Mom is going to be real happy.

41:27.721 --> 41:31.053
I'll hide all of us.

41:33.013 --> 41:34.388
I know where.

41:39.096 --> 41:41.135
You'll see my funny sisters.

41:45.263 --> 41:48.096
Then we'll find Kossatch's detachment.

46:28.596 --> 46:29.676
Wait a minute.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.342
Mom!

47:16.513 --> 47:18.801
They're not here. It's alright. Sit down.

47:57.388 --> 47:58.633
They're gone.

48:05.221 --> 48:07.592
Still warm. That's great.

48:22.930 --> 48:25.715
Eat. Mom made it.

50:42.846 --> 50:45.217
I know where they are. Let's go.

50:47.721 --> 50:48.717
What an idiot!

50:53.513 --> 50:54.509
Let's go!

50:55.888 --> 50:57.927
That's where they all are.

51:27.555 --> 51:29.428
Come on, let's go!

51:30.596 --> 51:33.051
It's right down here. Let's run!

51:56.888 --> 51:58.346
They're here!

52:01.513 --> 52:06.302
They've gone to the island! They're here!

52:26.930 --> 52:27.926
Glasha!

54:51.388 --> 54:56.011
They're back there, not here!

54:57.180 --> 55:00.428
No, they're not here! They're dead!

55:01.180 --> 55:06.253
They were all killed! All of them! Dead!

55:07.680 --> 55:10.844
They're not! They're here!

55:26.888 --> 55:28.133
Glasha!

56:44.721 --> 56:47.211
His family have all been killed!

56:47.763 --> 56:50.679
He's led me into the bogs!

56:50.971 --> 56:55.013
He's deaf! He's crazy!

56:55.930 --> 56:59.545
He's gone mad! He can't hear!

57:01.221 --> 57:04.137
He's taking me to the bogs!

57:21.096 --> 57:24.712
His whole family have been killed!

58:05.888 --> 58:10.096
Fliora, my dear child!
They killed your mother and sisters!

59:08.680 --> 59:13.385
Didn't I tell you...

59:15.430 --> 59:18.843
Didn't I tell you not to dig...

59:22.638 --> 59:26.419
Dead to the last one...

59:28.555 --> 59:32.596
To the very last one...

59:36.805 --> 59:39.341
Poured gasoline over me...

59:41.221 --> 59:42.336
I burned...

59:46.180 --> 59:50.388
I ran... I caught up with them...

59:53.388 --> 59:56.885
I begged them...

59:59.430 --> 1:00:02.096
to kill me...

1:00:03.888 --> 1:00:09.305
They just laughed...

1:00:11.930 --> 1:00:16.920
Didn't I tell you not to dig?

1:01:14.721 --> 1:01:16.298
Fliora!

1:02:48.388 --> 1:02:49.384
Alright?

1:02:49.596 --> 1:02:52.928
Why do you give him a nose?
He got syphilis.

1:02:53.138 --> 1:02:55.628
- Yes, and only one arm.
- And no balls.

1:02:55.846 --> 1:02:59.711
Yeah, his dong was already ripped off
in the last war.

1:03:00.805 --> 1:03:03.176
If you capture him,
what would you do to him?

1:03:04.013 --> 1:03:05.590
We once caught a horse thief.

1:03:05.805 --> 1:03:09.171
And our men put him bare-ass
on an ant hill!

1:03:10.138 --> 1:03:14.547
Even better, his bare ass on a red-hot
skillet that ain't been greased!

1:03:15.096 --> 1:03:17.763
Ask the women what to do with him.

1:03:25.263 --> 1:03:26.721
Shall I stick the ears on?

1:03:27.096 --> 1:03:31.387
Go ahead, let him hear all
we say about him.

1:03:35.055 --> 1:03:37.260
You got very soft hair.

1:03:37.471 --> 1:03:39.795
Soft like a baby's hair.

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.928
Now he's ready. Isn't that right?

1:04:29.138 --> 1:04:30.596
Cover him with shit!

1:04:30.805 --> 1:04:33.176
Where am I going to get it,
with everybody going hungry?

1:04:33.388 --> 1:04:36.221
- At least rip out his tongue.
- Put warts on him!

1:04:36.430 --> 1:04:40.211
I've made five of them already.

1:04:41.138 --> 1:04:44.137
- Have you finished, guys?
- That's it. He's ready.

1:04:44.346 --> 1:04:46.634
This one's not going to do any more
shouting! Let's go!

1:04:47.721 --> 1:04:49.927
Bastard! Son of a whore!

1:05:08.805 --> 1:05:10.678
We'll bring it back. Don't worry.

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:14.595
When we come back, it'll be yours.

1:05:14.971 --> 1:05:19.180
Why are you making a sick guy
of him? He's pretty strong.

1:05:19.596 --> 1:05:22.512
You can go along, if you want.
To hunt, the wolf walks on his paws.

1:05:22.721 --> 1:05:27.427
I know where there's a nice little
warehouse. Come on!

1:05:28.263 --> 1:05:31.428
Dear sons, you won't abandon us?

1:05:31.638 --> 1:05:34.886
What do you think we are, degenerates?

1:05:35.888 --> 1:05:40.013
What do you want us to bring you?
You order just like at the canteen.

1:05:40.263 --> 1:05:43.345
- Bread!
- Salt!

1:05:44.013 --> 1:05:47.131
- Milk, please!
- Potatoes!

1:05:47.471 --> 1:05:51.134
Get us some bread,
that'd be a hell of a good thing.

1:05:53.513 --> 1:05:57.129
You never knew it would end up
like this. You couldn't know.

1:05:59.096 --> 1:06:01.053
Fliora, look at me.

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:05.302
Go on, tell him that we'll be waiting.

1:06:05.763 --> 1:06:09.544
No. It's all my fault.

1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:37.275
Big, round and bright.

1:06:38.617 --> 1:06:41.865
They can see us a mile away
on a night like this.

1:06:44.409 --> 1:06:46.116
Hey, you frog, stop your croaking!

1:06:46.325 --> 1:06:50.190
Go on, you runners! You're not
snuggling in a woman's tits tonight.

1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:54.699
Carry me, if you're so smart!

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:36.367
Well? Was that your big warehouse attack?

1:08:38.034 --> 1:08:41.649
Oh, my legs! Why don't you carry my ass?

1:08:41.867 --> 1:08:43.823
How could I know they'd be here?

1:08:47.325 --> 1:08:50.609
Went for a booty, came back robbed.

1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:54.237
It serves you right, you good-for-
nothings!

1:08:54.450 --> 1:08:57.022
You got your mouths watering! A warehouse!

1:08:58.034 --> 1:09:00.737
Why the hell did you drag that psycho
along?

1:09:00.950 --> 1:09:04.317
The Germans were right behind us.
They tried to take him away.

1:09:05.909 --> 1:09:08.315
If it hadn't been for him,
we wouldn't all be here.

1:09:08.534 --> 1:09:11.616
You'd be back in Bobruisk,
in your kerosene shop.

1:09:11.825 --> 1:09:14.362
Gleb would be in his Leningrad swamp.

1:09:14.617 --> 1:09:19.950
You know, back home in Slutsk, we had
a guy who made vodka out of soap.

1:09:20.242 --> 1:09:21.949
What are you always laughing at?

1:09:22.659 --> 1:09:27.234
They asked a guy with a hump:
"How come your back's all round?"

1:09:27.450 --> 1:09:29.656
He says: "That's 'cause my chest caves in!"

1:09:29.867 --> 1:09:33.316
- You're a hopeless optimist.
- He should be cured of that.

1:09:33.534 --> 1:09:36.616
As for crying, there's already enough
crying in the world.

1:10:15.450 --> 1:10:18.947
So she says, "If I'd known all that,
I'd never have given birth to you."

1:10:19.492 --> 1:10:20.655
Charge it!

1:10:21.367 --> 1:10:23.240
This guy ain't going to holler no more!

1:10:25.617 --> 1:10:26.862
Come on, hurry!

1:10:27.617 --> 1:10:33.034
Don't tickle me, or my fart
is going to flatten Europe!

1:10:33.242 --> 1:10:36.324
The devil is not so black as his SS shits.

1:10:37.575 --> 1:10:39.448
I'd like to watch that!

1:10:39.659 --> 1:10:40.738
Right. Let's go.

1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:12.865
If you're so generous,
why don't you drop tobacco!

1:11:27.325 --> 1:11:29.447
"Kill the Bolshevik kikes.

1:11:29.659 --> 1:11:32.325
Smash a brick in their ugly mugs."

1:11:34.867 --> 1:11:36.195
That's all?

1:11:39.992 --> 1:11:41.450
Sent planes to deliver just that?

1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:48.363
Hey, Jews!

1:11:50.159 --> 1:11:52.778
Stand up! March on!

1:11:57.534 --> 1:12:00.284
Well? Shall we try one more time?

1:12:01.867 --> 1:12:05.992
Or like Roubej says, "Stay right on
my heels as trouble won't be far".

1:12:08.909 --> 1:12:09.905
Do we go?

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:14.690
Maybe we'll wait till night?

1:12:15.950 --> 1:12:19.613
Back there, people are starving,
and we're doing nothing.

1:12:29.409 --> 1:12:33.534
Go on! Move! The Germans are
in a hurry! Don't slow'em down!

1:12:36.159 --> 1:12:37.569
Damn!

1:12:38.784 --> 1:12:40.277
Let's go! Come on!

1:12:42.575 --> 1:12:43.571
Where you going?

1:14:28.659 --> 1:14:32.072
There you are. We haven't seen
you for a while.

1:14:32.909 --> 1:14:34.367
How can we manage without you?

1:14:35.075 --> 1:14:38.524
The only reason you fly over us
is to drop your little gifts.

1:14:39.867 --> 1:14:43.198
How about a motorcycle with a side-car?

1:14:44.034 --> 1:14:45.444
Haven't ridden in one for a long time!

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:48.196
Get down!

1:15:06.950 --> 1:15:10.531
They get drunk up there,
and we return the empties!

1:16:31.075 --> 1:16:34.158
Hold it, dad. You'll finish it later.

1:16:36.075 --> 1:16:39.524
Who is it?.. Who's there?..

1:16:40.075 --> 1:16:43.524
- Quiet! Are you in the police?
- And who are you, guys?

1:16:43.992 --> 1:16:48.200
Button up, you'll catch cold.
Is this village Kamenka?

1:16:48.409 --> 1:16:51.657
No, no. This is Bagoushovka.

1:16:52.575 --> 1:16:55.409
The Germans have been here
two days already.

1:16:56.659 --> 1:16:58.697
- Is the cow-shed locked?
- No.

1:16:58.909 --> 1:17:03.034
You're going to lead us out, along
with the cow. Got that, dad?

1:17:03.450 --> 1:17:06.947
And don't try any tricks.
You'll get us out and run back.

1:17:07.950 --> 1:17:10.784
Be quick about it. Just be natural.

1:17:10.992 --> 1:17:13.991
Yes, alright. If I have to, I have to.

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:16.322
I like men with common sense.
Fliora, are you awake?

1:17:17.950 --> 1:17:21.033
Your doors squeak. Better grease'em.

1:17:24.284 --> 1:17:28.030
How come the Germans didn't kill
the dogs? It's not right.

1:17:29.992 --> 1:17:33.157
You're white and your cow, too.
What'll we cover you with?

1:17:33.367 --> 1:17:36.034
- I'll get something in the house.
- A rifle, maybe?

1:17:36.242 --> 1:17:40.533
That's a trick you can pull on my
neighbor. His name's "Idiot".

1:17:41.784 --> 1:17:43.657
There's horse manure. Roll in it.

1:17:48.742 --> 1:17:50.864
What's your rank in the police?

1:17:51.742 --> 1:17:55.819
No, I'm not in the police!
It's the defensive brigade.

1:17:56.992 --> 1:18:02.065
Let's go now, and quick! Wouldn't
want your wife start missing you.

1:18:06.909 --> 1:18:08.153
Go on!

1:18:15.409 --> 1:18:17.447
Don't turn around, or you'll fall.

1:18:28.784 --> 1:18:30.028
Crouch down.

1:18:33.034 --> 1:18:36.033
Now you go back.

1:18:40.575 --> 1:18:42.946
Back home. Got it?

1:18:44.034 --> 1:18:46.072
And keep your mouth shut. You tell nobody.

1:18:47.409 --> 1:18:51.024
Get going! Run!

1:18:52.742 --> 1:18:54.568
Or your old lady'll bawl you out!

1:19:27.450 --> 1:19:29.158
I wonder what our dad's doing now?

1:19:29.367 --> 1:19:32.152
He took a little walk to do his business.

1:19:32.409 --> 1:19:35.573
He had a nice pair of boots on.
Box-calf leather.

1:19:36.909 --> 1:19:40.690
Maybe he's looking for us,
wants to trade his boots for mine?

1:19:43.325 --> 1:19:46.408
Nice cow, good one, stay here.

1:19:48.992 --> 1:19:49.988
Hold still!

1:19:52.450 --> 1:19:54.987
Hold still, my dear.

1:19:56.075 --> 1:19:58.316
Go on, milk her!

1:20:13.450 --> 1:20:16.366
We'll get drunk, you and me.
That's the good life!

1:21:18.659 --> 1:21:21.527
Uncle Roubej!

1:28:07.888 --> 1:28:10.887
Ho, giddup! Giddup, ho!

1:28:17.430 --> 1:28:22.005
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, comrade?

1:28:22.221 --> 1:28:24.427
I got no time to waste talking with you!

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:28.677
You got a hatchet? There's meat.
A cow's been killed there!

1:28:28.888 --> 1:28:32.420
Hey, wait! It's my horse you're taking!

1:28:35.513 --> 1:28:38.512
There're kids, a lot of people
starving to death!

1:28:38.721 --> 1:28:39.717
And us, ain't we people, too?

1:28:39.930 --> 1:28:44.387
People are fighting,
and you stay nice and warm inside.

1:28:51.138 --> 1:28:53.509
Look what they did!

1:29:00.055 --> 1:29:01.134
See what they did?

1:29:01.346 --> 1:29:03.670
Easy, boy, take it easy.

1:29:27.513 --> 1:29:29.552
You crazy or what?

1:29:30.013 --> 1:29:33.012
Put it all in there.

1:29:36.430 --> 1:29:40.555
The belt, the jacket... Hide it in there.

1:29:42.763 --> 1:29:43.926
Go on, hurry!

1:30:05.096 --> 1:30:06.673
Oh, such a thing!

1:30:06.888 --> 1:30:09.555
- What village is that?
- Perekhody.

1:30:09.763 --> 1:30:14.338
- We got two families with that name.
- You'll be a Perekhod, too. Got it?

1:30:16.096 --> 1:30:20.221
We had one like you who got drowned.
You'll be him.

1:30:20.430 --> 1:30:21.426
What was his name?

1:30:21.638 --> 1:30:26.462
You got a mother, you got sisters
and brothers.

1:30:27.221 --> 1:30:32.294
Olga, Katka, Fedia, and little Sonia.
You remember it all.

1:30:33.971 --> 1:30:37.836
Your mother's name is Fiokla Perekhod.

1:30:38.221 --> 1:30:41.055
And your name is Zhenka. You got it?

1:30:42.138 --> 1:30:43.383
Let's get out of here.

1:31:57.971 --> 1:32:01.801
This morning, I insulted a German soldier.

1:32:12.513 --> 1:32:14.172
And where's my father?

1:32:14.388 --> 1:32:18.004
- Say he's gone.
- Gone where?

1:32:18.346 --> 1:32:22.471
Where? Hell! What does it matter?
Come with me.

1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:26.260
Say you're Mitrophane,
my grandson. You got it?

1:33:52.180 --> 1:33:56.719
This is my family.
Aksinya Perekhod, my daughter-in-law...

1:33:58.846 --> 1:34:01.052
my sister and her children.

1:34:01.263 --> 1:34:04.262
- And who's that?
- My son-in-law. He's an accountant.

1:34:06.221 --> 1:34:10.003
Those are my sister's children, Lima, Raya,

1:34:10.221 --> 1:34:14.086
Zoika, Vika, Veronica, and little Boris.

1:34:15.013 --> 1:34:17.798
Get down! Search the houses!

1:34:22.013 --> 1:34:23.637
We came to see you...

1:34:23.846 --> 1:34:31.006
These are our neighbors, Maria and
her kids, Lucia, Frosia, Fenya, Ivan.

1:34:31.471 --> 1:34:35.087
We know what they want. They'll
take some and deport them to Germany.

1:34:35.305 --> 1:34:37.343
Who are they going to take? You?

1:34:38.596 --> 1:34:41.679
Come in. Everything's fine.

1:34:44.930 --> 1:34:47.135
You go and look on the roof.

1:35:03.096 --> 1:35:04.804
Quiet... quiet.

1:35:17.305 --> 1:35:18.633
Do you speak German?

1:35:20.721 --> 1:35:24.135
Me? Yes. Do you speak it, too?

1:35:25.305 --> 1:35:27.047
Do you speak German, too?

1:35:33.471 --> 1:35:34.752
Sit down.

1:35:45.180 --> 1:35:46.508
Please, eat.

1:35:55.846 --> 1:35:57.174
You take all you want, Sir.

1:36:00.221 --> 1:36:01.715
What have you got here?

1:36:07.305 --> 1:36:09.012
Oh, partisan!

1:36:22.263 --> 1:36:25.594
They put up resistance not far from here.

1:36:44.805 --> 1:36:50.838
Why are you drinking alone?
Pour some for me, too.

1:36:52.471 --> 1:36:54.131
Please, schnapps.

1:36:56.721 --> 1:36:59.969
Inhabitants of the village of Perekhody!

1:37:01.221 --> 1:37:04.469
Inhabitants of the village of Perekhody!

1:37:05.471 --> 1:37:12.464
Everybody in the village!
Listen attentively!

1:37:13.013 --> 1:37:17.588
You all take children and your papers.

1:37:17.805 --> 1:37:22.095
Go to the village square.

1:37:22.930 --> 1:37:28.168
We look at papers of all families
and lists...

1:37:30.846 --> 1:37:36.003
...and how German Army authorities'
orders are being followed.

1:37:36.805 --> 1:37:40.337
You must have all documents

1:37:40.638 --> 1:37:45.545
proving delivery of agriculture products.

1:37:49.930 --> 1:37:53.877
No one is to stay in house, in barn,

1:37:54.096 --> 1:37:57.878
in cellar, on roof or in attic...

1:38:14.846 --> 1:38:20.003
Wait! Where are you running?
They're going to slaughter you!

1:38:22.388 --> 1:38:26.679
What are you staring at?
Look down, bastard!

1:38:27.596 --> 1:38:29.304
I'm going to kill him!

1:38:35.013 --> 1:38:40.051
Take something to eat for two days.

1:38:40.263 --> 1:38:42.136
Bring all children...

1:38:55.388 --> 1:38:59.217
...Maintain order and discipline...

1:39:26.180 --> 1:39:32.295
Germany is... civilized country.

1:39:33.055 --> 1:39:36.552
Everyone who goes to Germany

1:39:36.763 --> 1:39:40.888
must have a toothbrush,

1:39:41.388 --> 1:39:45.513
toothpaste, shoe-polish, soap,

1:39:45.721 --> 1:39:48.969
a towel for every member of a family.

1:39:49.180 --> 1:39:54.253
To take fruits and vegetables is forbidden

1:39:54.471 --> 1:39:58.715
in order not to infect Europe.

1:40:15.596 --> 1:40:18.761
I, the officer of sanitary inspection,

1:40:19.138 --> 1:40:29.554
ascertain that the cause of death
was seven bullets

1:40:30.013 --> 1:40:34.553
that got stuck in the upper thorax.

1:40:35.013 --> 1:40:40.963
Anyone who won't follow
the orders of the German Army

1:40:41.180 --> 1:40:46.170
will meet the same miserable fate.

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:52.252
Herr Major, everything is fine!

1:40:54.221 --> 1:40:56.343
Sturmbanfuhrer, everything's ready.

1:40:56.555 --> 1:40:59.221
Do we invite them in?
Will there be any signal?

1:41:17.305 --> 1:41:20.055
Damn it! Bugger those bastards!

1:41:26.596 --> 1:41:30.638
Welcome, my dear friends!

1:43:32.305 --> 1:43:34.759
We caught a yid!

1:43:37.763 --> 1:43:41.509
This kike bastard wasn't smart enough
not to get caught!

1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:48.387
Dirty Jew!

1:43:54.930 --> 1:43:56.471
Grab him!

1:44:13.346 --> 1:44:19.462
Let me out! What are you doing,
bastards? I'm one of you!

1:44:36.763 --> 1:44:38.305
Quiet!

1:44:39.805 --> 1:44:43.171
Now, we're starting our village meeting.

1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:47.762
If anybody got anything to say,
go ahead and sign in!

1:45:06.388 --> 1:45:08.012
What are they doing there?

1:45:51.013 --> 1:45:52.507
Quiet down!

1:45:58.638 --> 1:46:01.471
Get out without children.

1:46:03.596 --> 1:46:06.761
Right here, out of the window.

1:46:08.971 --> 1:46:10.762
Leave the children.

1:46:13.430 --> 1:46:14.674
Come on, move it!

1:46:30.846 --> 1:46:33.596
Beasts!

1:47:27.013 --> 1:47:28.637
Come on, get out.

1:47:53.221 --> 1:47:58.460
Have you heard that he's taken up
command of a division?

1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:01.086
That's great! Don't you think so?

1:48:08.346 --> 1:48:09.591
Let go!

1:48:15.721 --> 1:48:17.678
What a picture!

1:48:20.055 --> 1:48:21.217
I'll kill you!

1:49:23.596 --> 1:49:24.841
To the right.

1:50:06.888 --> 1:50:10.053
Look! Empty! Empty!

1:50:11.846 --> 1:50:18.045
Ah, piss-ass clerks, that's what
you are! The intelligentsia!

1:50:24.513 --> 1:50:27.346
More gasoline. Let it soak through.

1:55:41.888 --> 1:55:44.342
Get up! Lead the cows!

1:55:45.638 --> 1:55:49.301
You! March! Go! Faster!

1:55:52.930 --> 1:55:55.301
Faster, you bastard!

1:58:01.971 --> 1:58:05.420
Petro, want some honey?

1:59:41.471 --> 1:59:45.762
We'll leave you here, grandma...
to reproduce!

1:59:45.971 --> 1:59:48.805
You make all of us some children.

2:04:34.346 --> 2:04:39.337
To love... to have children...

2:06:15.221 --> 2:06:16.845
Out of the way!

2:06:17.638 --> 2:06:20.044
Move! Out of the way!

2:06:26.513 --> 2:06:27.923
Wait!

2:06:29.555 --> 2:06:30.799
Are you all crazy?!

2:06:31.971 --> 2:06:40.588
You want to just kill them?..
Just like that?

2:06:40.846 --> 2:06:45.137
They're all SS! Punitive detachment!
They lit the fire. We're not Germans!

2:06:45.430 --> 2:06:46.758
Sit down!

2:06:46.971 --> 2:06:48.346
They made us do everything.

2:06:51.430 --> 2:06:55.638
Bastards! I lost my children
in that burning hell!

2:07:06.513 --> 2:07:10.211
Rank and unit?

2:07:13.721 --> 2:07:17.763
Walter Stein, SD Major.
15th Einsatzkommando.

2:07:18.513 --> 2:07:21.216
That's the fuhrer. He gave all the orders.

2:07:30.388 --> 2:07:32.842
He's an old, sick man.

2:07:37.846 --> 2:07:40.253
He never did any harm to anyone.

2:07:45.763 --> 2:07:47.554
He is,

2:07:47.763 --> 2:07:51.971
like his father was, a man of principle.

2:07:58.013 --> 2:08:02.967
He... he never harbored
any hatred of your people.

2:08:15.180 --> 2:08:20.004
He's never killed anyone,
he wouldn't kill a fly.

2:08:25.180 --> 2:08:29.127
Everyone here can confirm that,
and he hopes they will.

2:08:38.971 --> 2:08:43.713
He's just a tired, old man.
"I want to quit."

2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:48.138
That's what he's saying.

2:08:54.513 --> 2:08:59.752
He wants to take care of his grand-
children. He's got grandkids like you.

2:09:06.221 --> 2:09:10.796
But this is war time, and it's
nobody's fault, this German says.

2:09:11.263 --> 2:09:13.966
Swine! Dog!

2:09:17.263 --> 2:09:19.136
A typical German!

2:09:20.305 --> 2:09:23.469
Bastard! Shit!

2:09:24.971 --> 2:09:26.844
He's the one...

2:09:28.555 --> 2:09:34.137
He's the one who said: "Leave the children.

2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:41.006
You can come out, but not the children".

2:09:43.471 --> 2:09:46.885
He's a fascist! Executioner!

2:09:48.763 --> 2:09:55.922
Yes, I said that: "Come out
and leave the children".

2:09:58.555 --> 2:09:59.930
Translate it.

2:10:07.596 --> 2:10:10.679
I said that because with the children
it starts all over again.

2:10:13.930 --> 2:10:15.720
You've got no right to be.

2:10:18.971 --> 2:10:23.180
Not every race has a right to exist.

2:10:23.846 --> 2:10:25.589
Listen!

2:10:27.221 --> 2:10:29.012
Everyone, listen!

2:10:40.763 --> 2:10:43.679
Inferior races
spread the contagion of communism.

2:10:45.971 --> 2:10:47.465
You have no right to be.

2:10:52.388 --> 2:10:54.427
And our mission will be accomplished.

2:10:56.805 --> 2:10:58.346
If not today, tomorrow.

2:11:18.263 --> 2:11:21.345
It isn't me. He's the one who said it!

2:11:22.013 --> 2:11:27.051
We're not Germans! We're not Germans!

2:11:27.555 --> 2:11:29.760
We won't do it again! Forgive us!

2:11:29.971 --> 2:11:33.504
We're not Germans!

2:11:35.805 --> 2:11:40.593
Not Germans! You've forgotten
what these dogs did?!

2:11:41.013 --> 2:11:48.504
They're degenerates! They should be
killed! But we're not Germans...

2:11:49.513 --> 2:11:51.552
Then who are you, you filthy slime?

2:11:51.763 --> 2:11:53.802
They made us do it!

2:11:54.013 --> 2:11:57.261
We're not Germans! We're not Germans!

2:11:58.971 --> 2:12:05.585
Death to the fascist bastards!
Make them pay! Kill them!

2:12:08.763 --> 2:12:15.424
You'll do that yourself.
And you'll pay like the Germans.

2:12:26.055 --> 2:12:28.721
Give it to me! Give it!

2:12:29.513 --> 2:12:31.635
I'm one of you!

2:12:33.971 --> 2:12:35.631
Brothers, I'm one of you!

2:12:46.346 --> 2:12:50.756
Comrade, let's light it!
Comrade, let me have a torch!

2:12:50.971 --> 2:12:52.051
Out of the way!

2:14:44.055 --> 2:14:45.335
The new one!

2:15:11.846 --> 2:15:13.755
Come on, we're going!

2:19:38.888 --> 2:19:41.840
626 VILLAGES IN BYELORUSSIA

2:19:42.096 --> 2:19:46.008
WERE BURNT TO THE GROUND
WITH ALL THEIR INHABITANTS

2:20:56.513 --> 2:20:58.588
Move it! Let's go!

2:22:27.096 --> 2:22:29.384
The End
