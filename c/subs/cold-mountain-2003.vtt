'Dear Mr Inman,

00:33.759 --> 00:36.594
'I began by counting the days,

00:36.679 --> 00:39.348
'then the months.

00:39.432 --> 00:44.556
'I don't count on anything anymore
except the hope that you will return,

00:44.645 --> 00:50.351
'and the silent fear that in the years
since we saw each other,

00:50.443 --> 00:57.138
this war, this awful war, will have
changed us both beyond all reckoning.'

01:49.835 --> 01:52.291
This poor boy's from Alabama.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.416
He's a long way from home.
Thank you.

01:59.845 --> 02:02.846
Why don't them Yanks just attack?

02:12.858 --> 02:14.685
Got any shirts, son?

02:15.152 --> 02:21.273
Mm-hm-hm-hm

02:21.367 --> 02:23.609
It's Mo Oakley's boy.

02:24.620 --> 02:27.538
Can't be old enough to fight, can he?

02:33.671 --> 02:36.162
Good morning.
Morning, son.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.497
Got some boots and jackets.
You want one?

02:39.593 --> 02:42.263
Here. You want that?
Thanks.

02:43.681 --> 02:46.136
I hope these boots can hold up
for 400 miles,

02:46.225 --> 02:49.226
'cause they're taking me
back to Cold Mountain.

02:54.191 --> 02:57.145
'I think now
on the fleeting moments between us...

02:57.236 --> 02:59.809
'and wish I could repair them.

03:01.198 --> 03:05.362
My awkward nature,
the things left unsaid.'

03:09.674 --> 03:12.205
All right, that's it.

03:16.672 --> 03:18.997
Enough powder here
to blow a hole in the sky.

03:19.091 --> 03:22.460
Yeah, a real Yankee good mornin'.

03:22.553 --> 03:29.849
Mm-hm-hm-hm

03:36.984 --> 03:40.435
That old book of yours is in shreds.

03:41.572 --> 03:44.608
Same as us. Seen too much war.

03:46.077 --> 03:51.949
Hey, Oakley. Don't worry, son.
Them Yankee boys keep store hours.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.199
They ain't open yet.

04:03.928 --> 04:06.798
Close it up.

04:17.983 --> 04:21.565
Hey, where'd you come from?
Hey, that's fresh breakfast.

04:21.654 --> 04:23.646
He's mine, Butcher,
Hey. Hey. Get away.

04:23.739 --> 04:26.740
Hey, I saw him first.
Come on.

04:26.826 --> 04:30.325
I saw it first.
That's my rabbit. That's my rabbit.

04:33.207 --> 04:36.908
Get your paws off my rabbit.
Get your paws off my rabbit.

05:21.338 --> 05:24.174
'When I came with my father
to the town of Cold Mountain.

05:24.258 --> 05:26.831
'I was so shy of how I looked,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.383
'so out of place.

05:29.472 --> 05:33.801
'But did you know how happy I was
to escape from Charleston,

05:33.893 --> 05:37.641
from a world of slaves
and corsets and cotton?'

05:37.730 --> 05:40.517
What do you fools think
you'll be fightin' for?

05:40.608 --> 05:44.107
The South?
I call this nail Northern Aggression.

05:44.195 --> 05:47.314
Damn right.
I call this nail a Yankee Skull.

05:47.406 --> 05:50.111
Last time I checked,
the South was a direction.

05:50.201 --> 05:52.739
Never figured you
for a Lincoln lover, JT.

05:52.828 --> 05:54.572
I tell you, as soon as
I finish this chapel.

05:54.663 --> 05:56.786
I'm gonna go off
and kill me some Yankees.

05:56.874 --> 05:58.119
Piss and vinegar.

05:58.209 --> 06:00.830
Fightin' for a rich man's
slave, that's what.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.497
Whoa, here comes the minister.

06:02.588 --> 06:05.293
Ben, thank you.
Will you assist my daughter?

06:05.382 --> 06:07.340
Lord have mercy, look at that bonnet.

06:07.426 --> 06:09.134
Look what's in it.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.093
Oakley, hand me the hammer, boy.

06:11.180 --> 06:13.219
That's a true Southern belle.

06:13.307 --> 06:18.218
Mr Swanger. Good morning to you.
Morning, Reverend.

06:18.312 --> 06:21.396
Esco, you remember my daughter, Ada.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.640
Miss Monroe.
Good morning.

06:23.734 --> 06:24.897
Morning.
Morning.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.812
Excellent progress.
Morning.

06:26.904 --> 06:29.573
Mrs Swanger, Mrs Castlereagh.
Morning, Reverend.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.863
Now, if y'all will excuse me.

06:31.951 --> 06:36.696
In Charleston, my congregation would
still be disputing the size of the windows.

06:36.789 --> 06:37.820
It's a chapel.

06:37.915 --> 06:40.869
Miss Monroe, I was just thinkin' about you.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.625
Cold Mountain must feel
like the end of the world.

06:44.713 --> 06:47.287
Not at all.

06:47.383 --> 06:52.045
It's very beautiful.
Well, you put us all to shame.

06:52.138 --> 06:54.973
Men up here had a bearing on
what they thought a woman was,

06:55.057 --> 06:58.426
and then you showed up.
Oh...

06:58.519 --> 07:00.927
No, I doubt that.
Oh, believe me.

07:01.021 --> 07:05.933
If you was to say a word to one of these
fools, I could get my top field cleared.

07:07.445 --> 07:09.900
Any one?
No, um...

07:10.698 --> 07:13.023
Him in particular.

07:13.117 --> 07:15.193
Up in the rafters.

07:15.286 --> 07:17.907
Won't normally say boo to a goose.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.784
He's been pressin' me
since the day you arrived here.

07:28.758 --> 07:31.961
Your top field cleared?
That's right.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.140
Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe.

07:41.103 --> 07:42.895
Inman.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.178
Inman.

07:44.273 --> 07:46.100
WP Inman.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.187
WP Inman.

07:49.278 --> 07:51.983
Repeatin' a thing doesn't improve it.

07:53.866 --> 07:56.487
People call me Inman.

07:58.704 --> 08:00.697
How 'bout that? Inman speaks.

08:00.790 --> 08:04.739
If you were to take a glass of cider,
your friends might stop staring.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.295
Inman.

08:10.883 --> 08:15.924
You're just jealous, I'm gonna
take her for a walk at Bishop's Creek.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.765
Billy, is this frame flush?
Thank you.

08:18.849 --> 08:22.633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, yeah, right.

08:23.395 --> 08:26.562
Richie, I seen your house. There ain't
a square angle anywhere near it.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.891
And what do you do?

08:28.984 --> 08:31.273
I work wood.

08:31.362 --> 08:33.188
Hunt.

08:34.198 --> 08:36.770
Mostly work wood.

08:38.994 --> 08:41.034
Clear fields?

08:45.209 --> 08:47.581
I can clear a field.

08:48.754 --> 08:52.455
Was there something in particular
you wished to say to me?

08:57.054 --> 08:59.889
Not that comes to me.

09:06.021 --> 09:08.892
I'll say thank you... for the cider.

09:23.414 --> 09:29.583

11:04.723 --> 11:09.302
They're trapped in the wrong damn crater.
Whole plan backfired on 'em.

11:09.395 --> 11:11.802
Send them Yanks straight to hell.

11:11.897 --> 11:15.017
Hold it, hold it.
Let's go. Turn it around.

11:17.278 --> 11:20.148
Damn fools dug their own grave.

11:20.239 --> 11:23.026
We've got 'em now, boys.

11:24.660 --> 11:28.278
It's a turkey shoot.
What?

11:28.372 --> 11:31.741
It's a turkey shoot.
They've run themselves into a hole.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.910
Hell's busted.

12:35.356 --> 12:37.395
Oakley.

12:49.453 --> 12:52.324
Oakley.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.871
Oakley.

13:26.866 --> 13:30.282
Inman. Inman.
Oakley.

13:33.539 --> 13:35.247
Oakley.

14:02.985 --> 14:05.227
Inman.
Come on.

14:06.572 --> 14:08.280
Inman.

14:10.868 --> 14:13.822
I've got you.

14:40.898 --> 14:43.471
I got a few.

14:43.567 --> 14:46.058
You saw?
I saw.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.862
Am I gonna die?

14:55.621 --> 14:58.408
Your folks can be real proud of you.

15:11.846 --> 15:16.638
Son, this fellow says
he'll play whatever you want.

15:18.811 --> 15:22.595
What about 'Bonaparte's Retreat'?
That's one I play.

15:27.820 --> 15:31.189
No. Play me somethin' sweet.

15:31.282 --> 15:33.903
Like a girl's waiting for me.

15:35.119 --> 15:39.069
You heard him.
I only know a couple of tunes.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.703
Like when you're at Bishop's Creek...

15:42.501 --> 15:45.419
and you're thirsty...

15:45.504 --> 15:48.422
and the water's so cool.

15:50.134 --> 15:52.292
I don't know what music that is.

16:17.745 --> 16:20.829
I'm reachin' Cold Mountain before you.

16:58.077 --> 17:00.034
Good morning, Sally.

17:04.666 --> 17:07.952
Well, that's a fine sounding thing.
Oh...

17:08.963 --> 17:10.954
My piano.

17:12.508 --> 17:14.584
Oh, I've been missing it.

17:14.676 --> 17:18.817
Thank you, by the way.
Inman's in my top field clearing his debt.

17:19.401 --> 17:21.393
Oh, dear.

17:25.438 --> 17:27.726
And then he had nothing to say.

17:27.815 --> 17:30.353
He was happy.

17:31.652 --> 17:34.024
Really?

17:34.113 --> 17:37.030
Are men so different in Charleston?

17:38.993 --> 17:40.736
Men?

17:42.163 --> 17:44.072
I don't know.

17:44.165 --> 17:49.870
If you're sayin' you might like him,
why not go over and say good mornin'?

17:49.962 --> 17:51.955
I should be gettin' along.

17:52.047 --> 17:54.918
Walk on, quickly.

17:55.009 --> 17:58.129
Come on. Walk on. Slowly.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.260
Walk on.

18:10.316 --> 18:12.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.173
My dear daughter, Ada,

18:47.269 --> 18:53.806
who's given up so much for so long to help
me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely.

18:56.404 --> 19:02.691
Friends, we are both very happy
to have this opportunity tonight...

19:03.869 --> 19:06.787
to thank you from our hearts...

19:07.832 --> 19:12.909
for your kind welcome
and, most of all, such a fine chapel.

19:14.463 --> 19:16.788
So...

19:16.882 --> 19:19.883
...thank you, and God bless you.

19:22.930 --> 19:29.099
Our house is always open
to any of you at any time.

19:29.186 --> 19:31.642
Welcome.

19:31.730 --> 19:32.810
Esco?

19:37.111 --> 19:39.103
That gentleman -
he help build the chapel?

19:39.196 --> 19:42.150
Him? No, that's Teague.

19:42.241 --> 19:46.108
At one time the Teague family
owned the whole of Cold Mountain.

19:46.203 --> 19:50.699
My farm, your farm,
it all belonged to his grandpappy.

19:50.791 --> 19:53.365
Teague wanted this place bad,
and you got it.

19:53.461 --> 19:56.212
And he's here sniffin' out an advantage.

19:58.257 --> 20:03.880
There's no advantage here,
except to celebrate a job well done.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.177
And that is a good thing
in these troubled times,

20:06.265 --> 20:09.349
Miss Monroe.
Thank you,

20:14.106 --> 20:18.982
Were you never planning to come inside?
I'm wetter than a fish.

20:20.446 --> 20:23.649
There's a good fire going.
I'm all right.

20:26.410 --> 20:29.281
You're always carrying a tray.

20:31.582 --> 20:35.165
I was going to take some root beer
over to the Negroes.

20:43.219 --> 20:46.136
Somebody said you were enlisting.

20:46.263 --> 20:50.012
Are you?
If there is a war, we'll all fight.

21:03.739 --> 21:07.073
Did you get a picture made?
Say again?

21:07.159 --> 21:11.655
A tintype, with your musket
and your courage on display.

21:12.998 --> 21:15.536
You're laughin' at me.

21:17.044 --> 21:19.416
I don't know you.

21:23.217 --> 21:26.503
This doesn't come out right.

21:26.595 --> 21:32.135
If it were enough just to stand,
without the words...

21:33.936 --> 21:35.929
It is.

21:38.941 --> 21:40.815
It is.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.736
You... Look.

21:46.824 --> 21:50.240
Look. Look at the sky now.
What color is it?

21:52.413 --> 21:55.330
Or the way... a hawk flies?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.831
Or you wake up...

22:00.921 --> 22:05.418
and your ribs are bruised
thinking so hard on somebody.

22:06.510 --> 22:09.132
What do you call that?

22:17.605 --> 22:19.681
I'll do that.

22:20.900 --> 22:23.735
I can't get much wetter.

22:26.155 --> 22:30.532
'What if you are killed,
and I'll never see you again?

22:30.618 --> 22:35.410
'You said after a few years
I would barely remember your name.

22:35.498 --> 22:38.036
'Oh, Inman.

22:38.125 --> 22:42.834
It is more than three years,
and I remember your name.'

22:43.923 --> 22:46.710
Soldiers. Don't get up.

22:48.677 --> 22:50.884
You are mentioned tonight in my report.

22:50.971 --> 22:55.847
You men from Cold Mountain have
once again been heroes for the cause.

22:55.935 --> 22:59.802
There are Yankees in that stand of trees
between us, stuck there from the retreat.

22:59.897 --> 23:05.188
If they stay there, tomorrow mornin'
they can shoot us down for sport.

23:08.864 --> 23:11.438
Go around.

23:13.411 --> 23:14.869
It's a Reb.

23:14.954 --> 23:16.614
How many of them are there?

23:16.705 --> 23:18.116
I think there's five.

23:18.207 --> 23:21.161
Under the trees.

23:23.003 --> 23:25.126
We got 'em.
Let's go, let's go.

23:25.214 --> 23:27.337
Butcher's down.

23:28.509 --> 23:31.842
Leave him, leave him.
He's gone, Let's go.

23:34.557 --> 23:37.226
Go, go. Go. Run.

23:38.561 --> 23:42.309
Go. Go. Go.
Hold your fire.

23:42.398 --> 23:44.640
What's over by them trees?

23:44.733 --> 23:47.271
It's us. It's us.

23:49.488 --> 23:51.860
I said hold your fire. Hold your fire.

23:59.165 --> 24:02.415
Leave him. Leave him.

24:02.501 --> 24:04.827
Agh.

24:31.781 --> 24:34.651
Inman'll get it.

24:34.742 --> 24:39.036
Supposed to bring good luck,
a bird caught in a room.

24:39.121 --> 24:43.664
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.
She'll just be a few seconds.

25:48.524 --> 25:50.563
Mr Inman.
Reverend.

25:50.651 --> 25:53.486
What can I do for you?
I have some sheet music.

25:53.571 --> 25:57.022
It belonged to my father.
No use to me.

25:57.116 --> 25:58.776
Thank you.

25:58.868 --> 26:01.240
You must come in.
I should probably get along.

26:01.328 --> 26:04.532
Mr Inman is more comfortable outdoors.

26:04.623 --> 26:08.324
Perhaps we might...
perhaps we might take a walk.

26:08.419 --> 26:10.495
A splendid idea.

26:13.257 --> 26:15.795
Let me just get your hat.

26:19.346 --> 26:24.092
I dragged my poor daughter 400 miles
from Charleston to Cold Mountain...

26:24.185 --> 26:28.514
because my doctors,
they've been sayin' my chest is weak.

26:28.606 --> 26:31.393
So the air's supposed to do me good.

26:32.401 --> 26:34.726
But it's the view I think heals.

26:34.820 --> 26:39.447
It's what people say we're fightin' for.
To keep it that way.

26:39.533 --> 26:43.531
I have no plans to preach war
in my church, Mr Inman.

26:45.039 --> 26:50.709
I imagine God is weary of being called
down on both sides of an argument.

26:52.922 --> 26:55.413
I imagine God is.

27:01.347 --> 27:03.505
Thank you.

27:05.017 --> 27:07.888
Now, your father played the piano,
did he?

27:07.978 --> 27:10.220
That's right. He was a teacher.

27:10.314 --> 27:12.722
And is your father living, Mr Inman?

27:12.817 --> 27:15.058
He is not.
And your mother?

27:15.152 --> 27:18.438
No, sir. She died when I was born.

All right.
Inman. Inman.

29:07.139 --> 29:09.630
Ready to fight, son, ready to fight.

29:09.725 --> 29:10.804
Whoo.

29:10.893 --> 29:13.265
We got our war, man.

29:13.354 --> 29:15.845
Well, you have your war.

29:17.024 --> 29:18.187
Ada.

29:19.193 --> 29:21.020
Ada.

29:22.196 --> 29:25.113
It's a great day for North Carolina.

29:25.199 --> 29:29.244
Those who follow Lincoln
or preach abolition...

29:30.079 --> 29:32.237
you best keep one eye open
when you're sleepin'.

29:32.331 --> 29:35.534
Ol' boogeyman might get you.

29:35.626 --> 29:38.912
Are you the law all of a sudden,
Mr Teague?

29:39.004 --> 29:41.163
That's right, son.

29:41.257 --> 29:45.301
Home Guard for Haywood County.
And I'm the law from today.

29:45.386 --> 29:50.214
Y'all go fight now.
We'll watch over your sweethearts.

29:50.307 --> 29:52.633
Hey, Teague. Why ain't you fightin'?

29:52.726 --> 29:55.348
'Cause he's too old.

29:55.438 --> 29:57.596
Yeah.

29:57.690 --> 29:59.564
Whoo.

30:00.484 --> 30:03.402
You might be safer back in Charleston.

30:07.366 --> 30:11.613
But then who'll be waiting for you?
Three cheers for North Carolina.

30:11.704 --> 30:13.827
All right.
Three cheers for the South.

30:13.914 --> 30:15.492
Hip hip hurrah.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.789
Hip hip hurrah.

30:17.877 --> 30:20.000
Hip hip hurrah.

30:31.724 --> 30:34.559
Inman. It belongs to Inman.

30:34.643 --> 30:36.969
I got it. He's here.

30:41.275 --> 30:45.320
They found that book
you been worryin' about, soldier.

31:25.903 --> 31:27.812
Wait.

31:37.623 --> 31:41.455
I found you this book to take with you.

31:41.544 --> 31:43.620
William Bartram.

31:45.047 --> 31:47.372
They tell me it's good.

31:48.509 --> 31:52.459
I think he writes about these parts,
the author, so...

31:53.722 --> 31:55.845
Thank you.

31:57.184 --> 31:59.343
And this.

32:07.486 --> 32:10.191
I'm not smiling in it.

32:12.783 --> 32:15.618
I don't know how to do that,

32:15.703 --> 32:17.612
hold a smile,

32:41.187 --> 32:43.179
Ada.
What?

33:06.003 --> 33:08.494
Whoa.
He'll be back in a month.

33:11.092 --> 33:13.499
Kiss her for me.

33:20.893 --> 33:23.016
Come on, let's go.

33:28.150 --> 33:31.068
I'll be waiting for you.

34:06.439 --> 34:08.063
Lookin' good, Butcher.

34:08.149 --> 34:10.639
Bring home some Yankee scalps,
Swimmer.

34:10.734 --> 34:12.561
Yee-haw.

34:17.032 --> 34:22.193
Look out the window, ladies.
See what these poor fools are dyin' for.

34:22.288 --> 34:26.451
How many would still lose a leg
for the rich man's slave?

34:27.293 --> 34:29.621
Most of these soldiers'll
be dead by morning,

34:29.710 --> 34:32.308
or if they're stubborn,
by nightfall.

34:32.965 --> 34:37.627
I've other men outside
in the courtyard waitin' for beds,

34:37.719 --> 34:40.341
so any kind word will be a blessin'.

34:43.768 --> 34:46.341
It's the heat, I'm sorry. They rot.

34:46.437 --> 34:48.975
Pigeon River...

34:49.063 --> 34:51.734
How are you, son?

34:51.817 --> 34:54.818
Cold... Mountain...

34:57.198 --> 34:59.523
I-I'm sorry.

34:59.617 --> 35:04.029
You want water?
Cold... Mountain.

35:05.915 --> 35:07.991
Cold Mountain?

35:08.918 --> 35:10.910
Cold Mountain.

35:14.256 --> 35:20.129
Do you worry when there's no word
from him? From Mr Inman?

35:21.847 --> 35:23.674
Yes.

35:25.935 --> 35:28.639
But then I've tried countin'
the number of words...

35:28.729 --> 35:33.605
which have passed between Mr Inman
and me... not very many.

35:33.692 --> 35:37.939
But I think about him,
Daddy, all the time.

35:38.030 --> 35:42.242
I lost your mother
after 22 months of marriage.

35:44.203 --> 35:46.694
It was enough to fill a life.

35:52.795 --> 35:54.918
That was the last of the ham.

35:55.005 --> 35:58.421
It was delicious.
I have to learn how to cook.

35:58.509 --> 36:00.917
I was thinking of saying
something in chapel.

36:01.011 --> 36:03.134
Perhaps some of the womenfolk
will volunteer.

36:03.222 --> 36:06.425
I can't have people coming here
and cooking for me.

36:08.394 --> 36:09.805
I so...

36:09.895 --> 36:11.437
I so regret...

36:11.522 --> 36:17.809
I should have raised you less like a
companion and more like a young woman.

36:17.903 --> 36:22.031
I'm sorry, Ada.
And for dragging you here.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.155
I'm not sorry.

36:27.371 --> 36:30.076
I would have followed you anywhere.

36:32.585 --> 36:35.254
To Mongolia.
Mongolia.

36:36.380 --> 36:38.622
But with no one left
to work this place,

36:38.647 --> 36:41.661
nothing to buy, nothing
left to buy it with.

36:43.220 --> 36:47.265
I just don't know how we're gonna
get through another winter.

36:49.977 --> 36:55.731
Will you play me somethin'? Somethin'
peaceful while I look over my sermon.

36:55.816 --> 36:57.856
It's too damp out here.
You should come inside.

36:57.943 --> 36:59.770
No.

36:59.862 --> 37:00.893
I like it.

37:16.587 --> 37:19.588
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in.

37:22.176 --> 37:24.667
Come inside before you drown.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.599
You have a letter.

38:14.687 --> 38:16.726
North Carolina.

38:18.482 --> 38:21.056
It's come a long way.

38:23.946 --> 38:26.235
It's not too recent.

38:26.323 --> 38:28.814
It's written this past winter.

38:31.078 --> 38:33.486
I'm afraid I can't read who it's from.

38:38.335 --> 38:40.494
'Dear Mr Inman...'

38:41.464 --> 38:47.087
'Since you've left, time has been
measured out in bitter chapters.

38:47.178 --> 38:49.847
'Last fall, my poor father died.

38:51.807 --> 38:54.678
'Our farm at Black Cove is abandoned.

38:57.605 --> 39:01.816
'Every house in these mountains
touched by tragedy.

39:04.195 --> 39:08.940
'Each day the dread...
of learning who has fallen...

39:10.201 --> 39:13.202
who will not return from this terrible war.

39:15.206 --> 39:18.242
'And no word from you.

39:18.334 --> 39:20.373
'Are you alive?

39:20.461 --> 39:23.213
'I pray to God you are.

39:24.381 --> 39:26.670
'This war is lost on the battlefield...

39:26.759 --> 39:31.551
and is being lost twice over
by those who stayed behind.'

39:31.639 --> 39:35.008
He ain't comin' back, you know that.

39:39.188 --> 39:41.893
You must know that in your heart.

39:44.485 --> 39:46.608
Look at me.

39:48.364 --> 39:50.736
Look at me.

39:55.454 --> 39:58.028
I'm not nothin'.

40:00.334 --> 40:04.877
'I'm still waiting, as I promised I would.

40:07.383 --> 40:10.918
'But I find myself alone
and at the end of my wits...

40:12.596 --> 40:17.305
too embarrassed to keep taking
from those who can least afford to give.'

40:18.394 --> 40:21.348
Ada. It's Sally.

40:21.439 --> 40:22.637
Ada.

40:22.731 --> 40:24.854
Look at the state of this place.

40:24.942 --> 40:28.607
Well, set it on the porch.

40:30.114 --> 40:33.565
She let them slaves go free, and now...

40:33.659 --> 40:38.451
Poor soul, she's got nobody and nothin',
and waitin' on a ghost.

40:44.837 --> 40:46.711
Shoo.

40:49.341 --> 40:51.251
Go away.

40:56.307 --> 40:57.635
Devil.

41:01.312 --> 41:05.808
'My last thread of courage now
is to put my faith in you...

41:08.277 --> 41:11.029
'and to believe I will see you again.

41:12.198 --> 41:16.658
'So now I say to you, plain as I can...

41:18.120 --> 41:21.370
'if you are fighting, stop fighting.

41:22.625 --> 41:25.958
'If you are marching, stop marching.

41:28.089 --> 41:30.496
'Come back to me.

41:34.053 --> 41:36.378
Come back to me is my request, '

41:44.563 --> 41:47.054
'Come back to me.

41:48.692 --> 41:52.358
Come back to me is my request.'

41:54.573 --> 41:58.523
Wounded men, don't stray
from the hospital grounds.

41:59.203 --> 42:01.243
Hey.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.623
If they send us back to fight...

42:04.708 --> 42:08.623
Hey, get your peanuts now,
from the blind man.

42:10.047 --> 42:13.463
Hey, your hot goobers here.
It's a sad day.

42:17.471 --> 42:20.306
Gettin' better, soldier?

42:20.391 --> 42:23.096
Seems that way.

42:23.185 --> 42:25.142
I wouldn't hurry.

42:25.229 --> 42:29.143
The war's almost done.
Don't need your help to lose it.

42:30.401 --> 42:35.526
You got ten minutes now, boys. Ten
minutes to get your haircuts and shaves.

42:35.614 --> 42:38.485
I've been meanin' to ask you.
Where'd you take your wound?

42:38.576 --> 42:40.817
Oh, before I was born.

42:40.911 --> 42:43.319
Never set eyes on a thing in this world.

42:43.414 --> 42:49.001
Not a tree, a gun or a woman.
Put my hand on all three, though,

42:50.713 --> 42:53.548
What would you give for that?
Hm?

42:53.632 --> 42:58.010
To have your eyeballs for ten minutes,
Ten minutes?

42:58.095 --> 43:00.633
I wouldn't give an Indian head cent,

43:00.723 --> 43:04.851
Might turn me hateful.
That's sure what seein's done to me.

43:04.935 --> 43:07.853
No, that's not the way I meant it.

43:07.938 --> 43:10.429
You said ten minutes.

43:10.524 --> 43:14.937
It's havin' a thing and then
the loss of it I'm talking about.

43:15.029 --> 43:20.734
Then we don't agree. There's not much I
wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace.

43:20.826 --> 43:24.776
Yeah, someplace... or someone.

43:27.833 --> 43:30.834
You watch yourself, now.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.921
They're shootin' men
who take themselves a walk.

44:12.837 --> 44:15.956
By order of Zebulon Vance,

44:16.048 --> 44:19.464
governor of this great state
of North Carolina,

44:19.552 --> 44:24.593
any soldier turned deserter
is guilty of treason,

44:24.682 --> 44:27.517
and should be hunted down like a dog.

44:29.019 --> 44:34.358
Any man who takes in a deserter
is likewise guilty of treason.

44:34.442 --> 44:38.356
The Home Guard is powered
to enter any place it sees fit...

44:38.446 --> 44:41.815
without notice or constraint

44:41.907 --> 44:44.695
Captain Teague needs more volunteers.

44:44.785 --> 44:49.032
Any man whose age or infirmity
prevents him from fightin' shall join us...

44:49.123 --> 44:53.666
to protect this county from Yankee raiders
and traitors to the cause.

44:53.753 --> 44:55.662
Is there a letter for me?
Nothin'.

44:55.755 --> 45:00.547
We've been gettin' no post through at all.
The sooner we lose this war the better.

45:00.634 --> 45:03.801
They say not one boy in ten
is comin' home to these mountains.

45:03.888 --> 45:09.178
Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight
around. They're worse than the Yankees.

45:09.268 --> 45:11.759
Might I speak with you, please?

45:13.355 --> 45:16.191
This was the Reverend Monroe's.

45:18.652 --> 45:21.274
I don't know who would want a watch.

45:23.699 --> 45:26.237
Who can bear to look at the time?

45:29.288 --> 45:32.324
I've got a little salt pork you can have.

45:33.834 --> 45:36.705
Keep your daddy's watch.

45:38.172 --> 45:40.745
Thank you.

45:42.343 --> 45:44.300
I was talkin' to some of
the other womenfolk...

45:44.325 --> 45:47.031
about maybe lookin' in on you
at Black Cove, It's hard right now, but...

45:47.056 --> 45:50.888
Oh, no, I manage very well,
whatever the talk is.

45:53.354 --> 45:55.927
I'm very grateful for the pork.

45:58.234 --> 46:01.353
Which I intend to pay for, of course.

46:09.954 --> 46:12.705
Is everything all right?

46:12.790 --> 46:14.913
Mm-hmm.

46:29.223 --> 46:31.050
Ada.

46:31.142 --> 46:32.968
Ada.

46:34.937 --> 46:38.472
Why, Ada, you are skinny
as a whippet, girl.

46:38.566 --> 46:42.017
You are comin' indoors with me.
No, I can't.

46:42.111 --> 46:44.103
I don't...

46:45.281 --> 46:47.439
I can't keep countin' on your kindness.

46:47.533 --> 46:49.609
Now, come on, I'm makin' a stew.

46:49.702 --> 46:54.530
We'd be proud to have you.
Esco's gonna be wantin' his dinner.

46:55.833 --> 46:59.332
I just wanna stop, I tell you. Yeah.

46:59.420 --> 47:03.833
Sit on the porch with Sal,
watch my boys in the fields,

47:03.924 --> 47:07.839
holler 'Good job' every hour or so.

47:07.928 --> 47:11.712
That'll be a good day,
when our boys get home.

47:11.807 --> 47:14.642
What about your people in Charleston?

47:17.772 --> 47:20.523
There are no people.

47:20.608 --> 47:23.359
And there's no money.

47:23.444 --> 47:27.394
My father had some bonds
and investments.

47:27.490 --> 47:31.190
They're worthless now, of course.
The war...

47:32.787 --> 47:37.698
They're not worth anything.
I don't have anywhere else to go.

47:43.339 --> 47:45.545
I don't wanna go.

47:47.718 --> 47:50.636
You're waiting on a feller.
Oh.

47:53.808 --> 47:55.884
Look down our well...
Esco...

47:55.976 --> 47:57.969
She should.

47:58.729 --> 48:04.020
If you look down our well with a mirror,
you'll see the future. It's what they say.

48:05.569 --> 48:08.321
You do it.
She does it.

48:10.658 --> 48:12.318
What kind of mirror?

48:13.619 --> 48:17.237
We'll hold on to you, Esco, you hold on.
I got her,

48:17.331 --> 48:19.905
We got you.
Mm.

48:21.502 --> 48:23.495
See anything?

48:25.798 --> 48:26.961
Uh...

48:27.758 --> 48:29.252
Uh...

48:29.343 --> 48:32.261
I don't know.
I tried many a time,

48:32.346 --> 48:35.715
lookin' for a sign
my boys were comin' home.

48:35.808 --> 48:38.097
I never saw a dickey bird.

48:53.200 --> 48:56.071
Oh.
Are you all right? Ada?

48:56.162 --> 48:58.913
What? What happened?

49:00.958 --> 49:03.793
What'd you see? What'd you see?

49:04.628 --> 49:07.962
'Yesterday,
I saw you walkin' back to me...

49:08.799 --> 49:10.875
'or thought I did.

49:12.094 --> 49:16.673
'I found myself crouching
over Sally Swanger's well...

49:22.104 --> 49:25.556
'...like a madwoman
staring into its secrets.

49:27.443 --> 49:32.983
'Was it you I saw walking home to me,
or was it your ghost?

49:33.074 --> 49:37.285
'After so long, I know I must learn
to survive on my own...

49:37.369 --> 49:40.489
'and accept you will not return.

49:40.581 --> 49:43.915
And yet I cannot. I cannot.'

49:49.590 --> 49:51.748
Them cows wants milkin'.

49:51.842 --> 49:55.092
If that letter ain't urgent,
them cows is is what I'm sayin'.

49:55.179 --> 49:57.218
I don't know you.

49:57.306 --> 50:00.473
Old lady Swanger says you need help.

50:00.559 --> 50:02.635
Here I am.

50:03.521 --> 50:08.396
I... I need help but... I need...
I do need help, but I need a laborer.

50:08.484 --> 50:13.525
There's... plowing and rough work, I
think there's been a misunderstanding.

50:13.614 --> 50:16.449
What's that rake for?

50:16.474 --> 50:17.329
The rake?

50:17.354 --> 50:19.309
Well, it ain't for
gardenin', that's for sure.

50:19.370 --> 50:22.988
Number one, you got a horse?
I can plough all day, I'm a worker.

50:23.082 --> 50:25.489
Number two, ain't no man better'n me,

50:25.584 --> 50:29.831
'cause there ain't no man around
who ain't old or full of mischief.

50:31.257 --> 50:34.791
I know your plight.
My plight?

50:34.885 --> 50:38.420
Am I hard to hear?
'Cause you keep repeatin' everything.

50:38.514 --> 50:42.179
I ain't lookin' for money, I never cared
for it and now it ain't worth nothin'.

50:42.268 --> 50:45.434
I expect to board and eat,
at the same table.

50:45.521 --> 50:48.688
I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin'.
You're not a servant.

50:48.774 --> 50:53.436
People's gonna have to empty
their own night jars is my point.

50:53.529 --> 50:56.400
And I don't expect to work
whilst you sit around and watch, neither.

50:56.490 --> 50:57.605
Right.

50:57.700 --> 51:00.535
Right. Is that a yes or a no?

51:03.164 --> 51:06.200
There's a rooster.
He's the devil. I'm sure of it.

51:06.292 --> 51:08.865
I go near him
and he is at me with his spurs.

51:08.961 --> 51:11.119
He's Lucifer himself.

51:11.213 --> 51:14.463
I despise a floggin' rooster.

51:15.426 --> 51:17.465
Oh, no, I wouldn't...

51:17.553 --> 51:20.554
My name's Ruby Thewes,
I know your name.

51:29.982 --> 51:32.473
Let's put him in a pot.

51:38.741 --> 51:40.568
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm ♪

51:40.659 --> 51:44.574
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm ♪

51:46.415 --> 51:47.874
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm ♪

51:47.958 --> 51:52.288
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm ♪

51:58.427 --> 52:00.336
Urgh.

52:01.388 --> 52:03.926
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm ♪

52:04.016 --> 52:07.681
♪ Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm ♪

52:09.271 --> 52:15.060
♪ I've gone to find my ain true love ♪

52:35.714 --> 52:39.961
You're my angel, my butterfly.

52:41.512 --> 52:43.837
Come fly away.

52:46.725 --> 52:49.643
My love...

52:49.728 --> 52:52.682
God forgive me for doin' this.

52:52.773 --> 52:55.062
I'm so sorry.

52:55.151 --> 52:57.902
I'm sendin' you to a better place.

52:59.905 --> 53:02.776
You go fly away.

53:02.867 --> 53:04.693
Hey.

53:04.785 --> 53:05.995
Don't do that.

53:06.020 --> 53:09.851
Don't pull that trigger.
I'm a man of God.

53:09.915 --> 53:14.412
I killed several of them.
I mean I'm God's minister.

53:14.503 --> 53:18.548
What part of God's business
is throwin' a woman down a gorge?

53:18.632 --> 53:20.874
A slave woman.

53:20.968 --> 53:24.752
Can you see that in this light?
Black as a bucket of tar,

53:24.847 --> 53:27.764
Is she dead?
No, I drugged her,

53:27.850 --> 53:30.092
like you would a butterfly.

53:30.186 --> 53:33.187
And I care for her.
That's the heartbreak of it.

53:33.981 --> 53:36.899
She's got my bastard in her belly.

53:36.984 --> 53:39.392
Come on. Back up,

53:41.655 --> 53:44.146
I'm beggin' you.
Git.

53:44.241 --> 53:49.912
It's better you blow out my brains
than return me to this place.

53:50.831 --> 53:53.785
You're gonna put her back
where she sleeps.

53:55.002 --> 53:58.169
I do that, the members will lynch me...

53:58.255 --> 54:02.882
for sirin' a bastard while servin' as their
preacher. We're a strict congregation.

54:02.968 --> 54:06.587
We've churched men
for pickin' up a fiddle on the Sabbath.

54:06.680 --> 54:09.516
So you reckon to kill her?
What, because she's a slave?

54:12.144 --> 54:13.852
I... um...

54:13.938 --> 54:16.263
There's a back door. Have pity.

54:18.609 --> 54:20.767
Thank you.

54:20.861 --> 54:23.566
I was gonna do a grievous wrong.

54:26.242 --> 54:29.159
I think I should go back up to my wife.

54:30.746 --> 54:32.822
She wakes at the slightest noise.

54:32.915 --> 54:34.789
Agh. Ohh...

54:34.875 --> 54:36.868
Where's some paper and a pencil?

54:47.555 --> 54:51.255
Hey, Ada. You up?

54:53.394 --> 54:54.722
Yes.

54:54.812 --> 54:57.303
Wha...? It's still dark.

54:57.398 --> 55:00.268
Tell that to the cows. It's late.

55:07.032 --> 55:09.321
You all set?

55:09.410 --> 55:11.486
Oh, I-I just have to eat somethin'.

55:11.579 --> 55:14.496
Well, then, you got to get up earlier.
What's that?

55:16.500 --> 55:18.789
A novel.

55:18.878 --> 55:22.377
You wanna carry a book,
carry one you can write in.

55:23.716 --> 55:30.050
We got our own story.
It's called Black Cove Farm: Catastrophe.

55:31.015 --> 55:35.475
I can spell it, too. Learned it the same
place you did, in the schoolhouse.

55:35.561 --> 55:38.099
One of the first words they taught me.

55:38.189 --> 55:43.479
'Ruby Thewes,
you are a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e, '

55:43.569 --> 55:46.523
Three years I was in school,
before my daddy...

55:46.614 --> 55:49.817
Sayin' God rest his soul is like
wishin' him what he had in life.

55:49.909 --> 55:52.696
He lived to rest. He was born tired.

55:52.787 --> 55:55.278
He decided... better use for me...

55:55.372 --> 55:58.955
than havin' me sat all day
in front of a chalkboard.

56:06.550 --> 56:11.924
Number one, lay out a winter garden
for cool-season crops.

56:12.014 --> 56:15.715
Turnips right there, onions, cabbage.

56:17.895 --> 56:19.058
Collards.

56:19.146 --> 56:22.764
Number two,
patch the shingles on the barn roof.

56:22.858 --> 56:25.147
Have we got a maul and froe?

56:25.236 --> 56:28.936
Maul?
Maul, M-a-u-I.

56:29.031 --> 56:32.198
Number three, clear and turn this field.

56:39.083 --> 56:42.666
No harm done lettin' it go.
Now we'll do well.

56:43.504 --> 56:44.583
Number 15...

56:44.672 --> 56:45.537
16,

56:45.631 --> 56:47.125
Number 16...
Number 16...

56:47.216 --> 56:51.629
Put up some gourds for a martin colony.
Keep away these crows.

56:51.720 --> 56:56.797
One thing in abundance on this farm,
and that's crows. Shut the gate.

57:40.102 --> 57:42.807
I'd pay a dollar for an egg.

57:43.856 --> 57:46.394
I've got no quarrel with you.

57:46.484 --> 57:47.978
Hey.

57:48.986 --> 57:51.987
Am I near the Cape Fear River?

58:23.979 --> 58:27.016
Home Guard. Get back there.

58:27.108 --> 58:28.851
Runaways.

58:34.281 --> 58:36.321
Come on, boys.

58:37.493 --> 58:39.284
Let's get 'em.

58:39.370 --> 58:42.075
They're spreadin' out in the field.

58:46.293 --> 58:48.416
Come back here.
They're in the field.

58:48.504 --> 58:50.627
They're in the field.

59:00.808 --> 59:03.097
I can get you outta here.

59:08.774 --> 59:11.811
I daresay that's Home Guard followin' you.

59:11.902 --> 59:15.734
They're out on the road,
huntin' down deserters.

59:15.823 --> 59:18.112
And I don't recommend that way.

59:18.200 --> 59:22.068
You'll meet half the town comin' after me
with a noose, thanks to you.

59:22.163 --> 59:24.867
I should have shot you
when I had the chance.

59:24.957 --> 59:29.370
I know where there's a ferry crossin'.
Or you can stubborn yourself to death,

59:30.713 --> 59:32.480
If this is a trap...

59:32.505 --> 59:35.822
Please yourself, I'm
just bein' a Christian,

59:36.427 --> 59:39.000
You got any money?
$5.

59:39.096 --> 59:42.679
For $5 I wouldn't give a parched man
a dipper of this river water.

59:42.767 --> 59:44.889
The sign says 'Ferry $5,'

59:44.977 --> 59:49.935
Nobody crosses these waters
unless they're runnin' from someplace.

59:50.858 --> 59:53.314
You wanna wait for your friends?

59:53.402 --> 59:55.561
I can give you $30 Confederate.

59:55.654 --> 59:57.980
Well, all right, let's go.

59:58.074 --> 01:00:00.031
Whatever that's worth.

01:00:05.039 --> 01:00:07.031
They cut off my hair.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:11.039
That was hard.

01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:13.204
I was vain about my hair.

01:00:14.006 --> 01:00:16.497
I had curls.

01:00:17.218 --> 01:00:19.969
But I deserved it.

01:00:20.054 --> 01:00:24.846
I'm the Reverend Veasey.
Have I seen you in church?

01:00:24.934 --> 01:00:27.721
No, Not likely to, neither.

01:00:27.812 --> 01:00:32.141
I'd say these days, the
devil rules the roost.

01:00:34.985 --> 01:00:37.274
30 more dollars,
we can go over to that cabin...

01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:40.483
and I can pull this dress over my head.

01:00:42.701 --> 01:00:44.990
Have we got $30?

01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:50.828
Get down.
I got one.

01:00:59.093 --> 01:01:00.752
Is there any other way to cross?

01:01:00.777 --> 01:01:03.162
Barge or boat. The
water's full of gators.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.633
What's this wood?

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:09.263
I don't know.
In.

01:01:10.104 --> 01:01:11.563
I don't know.
Pine.

01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:15.146
Locust?
Pine. Where's north?

01:01:15.234 --> 01:01:18.270
North? Uh...

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.949
Name me three herbs
that grow wild on this farm.

01:01:22.032 --> 01:01:24.405
I can't, I can't, all right?

01:01:25.828 --> 01:01:29.197
I can talk about farming in Latin.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.872
I can... I can read French.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.795
I know how to lace up a corset,
God knows.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.956
I can name the principal rivers in Europe.

01:01:38.048 --> 01:01:41.667
Just don't ask me
to name one stream in this county.

01:01:41.761 --> 01:01:44.845
I can... I can embroider
but I can't darn.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:49.010
I can arrange cut flowers
but I can't grow them.

01:01:51.228 --> 01:01:54.182
If a thing has a function,
if I might do something with it,

01:01:54.273 --> 01:01:57.642
then it wasn't considered suitable.

01:01:59.987 --> 01:02:02.063
Why?

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:08.446
Ruby, you can ask why about
pretty much everything to do with me.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.870
This fence is about the first thing
that I've ever done...

01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:19.046
that might produce an actual result.

01:02:29.725 --> 01:02:33.260
So you never wrapped your legs
around this Inman?

01:02:34.271 --> 01:02:36.098
Oh.

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:41.728
Come on.

01:03:26.741 --> 01:03:28.283
Fine piano.

01:03:54.185 --> 01:03:57.803
If we're careful,
now we'll get through winter.

01:03:57.897 --> 01:04:00.304
I got old man Roy
to give me ten of them sheep,

01:04:00.399 --> 01:04:02.606
on account of I said they's so small,

01:04:02.693 --> 01:04:06.394
put together they weren't no bigger
than six proper sheep.

01:04:06.489 --> 01:04:09.525
My father always wanted
sheep on this farm.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.528
I cut off my hair
once for money.

01:04:15.623 --> 01:04:21.210
My daddy got $ 2 for it.
Made a wig for some rich feller in Raleigh.

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:26.924
I'm just sayin'
I'm real sorry you had to lose your piano.

01:04:27.009 --> 01:04:28.966
Ruby, it was my idea.

01:04:29.053 --> 01:04:32.137
Stobrod liked to call himself a musician.

01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:36.766
My daddy.
He could play six tunes on a fiddle.

01:04:36.852 --> 01:04:40.387
Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg.

01:04:41.315 --> 01:04:43.936
I was like his goat.

01:04:44.026 --> 01:04:46.482
Or some critter tethered to a post.

01:04:50.324 --> 01:04:53.278
He left me once.
Up in them mountains.

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:55.776
I was eight.
He was gone over two and a half weeks.

01:04:55.871 --> 01:04:58.243
He left you?

01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:03.794
Uh-huh, I was all right.

01:05:03.879 --> 01:05:09.715
My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for liquor
and not 40 inches for kindness.

01:05:11.804 --> 01:05:14.509
I'm so plugged up.

01:05:14.598 --> 01:05:18.263
Used to be as regular as morning prayers.

01:05:18.352 --> 01:05:22.017
Matter of fact,
I could set my watch by my bowels.

01:05:23.566 --> 01:05:30.233
Open my gut now, they'd find turds
stacked up like little black twigs.

01:05:31.323 --> 01:05:33.565
Home Guard.

01:05:47.631 --> 01:05:49.541
Hey,
Shh.

01:05:49.633 --> 01:05:52.587
Look at this.
Keep your voice down.

01:05:53.804 --> 01:05:55.797
Look at this.

01:05:57.683 --> 01:06:00.388
It's a good saw.
And it's not yours.

01:06:01.729 --> 01:06:05.679
You're a Christian.
Don't you know your Commandments?

01:06:06.692 --> 01:06:11.437
You'll find the good Lord
very flexible on the subject of property.

01:06:12.782 --> 01:06:15.486
We could do a lot with this saw.

01:06:15.576 --> 01:06:19.656
Cut down a tree.
Play music with it.

01:06:21.165 --> 01:06:23.490
You're gonna thank me for this saw.

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:27.416
I'll say thank you when I've lost you
and I've found some food.

01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:29.581
You'll see.
You'll thank me.

01:06:41.018 --> 01:06:42.927
Shh.

01:06:47.691 --> 01:06:49.731
Good day to you.

01:06:56.575 --> 01:07:01.818
My old bull... wandered off...
and died in this here creek.

01:07:01.914 --> 01:07:05.449
Poisonin' up our water
is how I found him.

01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:11.369
Thank you.
You are a true Christian,

01:07:12.925 --> 01:07:17.504
That's a rank odor from that animal.
Been dead a good while, I reckon.

01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:20.928
This is a tricky one.

01:07:23.102 --> 01:07:27.396
You fellers help me out,
my woman'll cook you up a good dinner.

01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:29.770
I'm gettin' an idea.

01:07:31.277 --> 01:07:33.602
My saw's the remedy.

01:07:33.696 --> 01:07:37.112
I believe you need two people,
one on either end.

01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:38.693
Yeah.

01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:40.777
Give me that saw.

01:07:46.709 --> 01:07:48.120
Let's do this in chapters.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:49.835
That's right.
Yeah.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.708
Start at the neck.

01:07:53.215 --> 01:07:55.172
Aw...

01:07:57.762 --> 01:08:00.466
Oh, well. That is unpleasant.

01:08:02.183 --> 01:08:04.555
There's my place.

01:08:04.643 --> 01:08:08.226
Hope you can stomach
a yard chock full of female.

01:08:08.314 --> 01:08:11.268
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

01:08:11.358 --> 01:08:12.936
Hallelujah.

01:08:13.027 --> 01:08:18.068
Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
The Israelites.

01:08:18.157 --> 01:08:19.651
What happened?

01:08:19.742 --> 01:08:21.865
He's got a shit comin',
It's overdue.

01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:27.742
The tribes of Israel are about to flee
from the banks of Egypt.

01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:30.459
Good God.

01:08:30.544 --> 01:08:33.379
These boys are stoppin' for supper.

01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:40.970
Brought my woman home,

01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:45.551
she showed up with her three sisters,
so-called, and their brats.

01:08:45.643 --> 01:08:47.885
That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla,

01:08:47.978 --> 01:08:50.814
and the pretty one in
blue is my wife, Lila.

01:08:53.317 --> 01:08:55.523
Those are fine examples of the female.

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:15.207
Oh, I'm about to pass out.

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:20.801
My home brew sneaks up on you.
It curdles your durdles.

01:09:20.886 --> 01:09:23.377
Oh, Oh, look. He's gone now.

01:09:23.471 --> 01:09:25.465
Look, He's gone now.

01:09:26.308 --> 01:09:28.348
His eyes, they've gone,

01:09:28.435 --> 01:09:31.305
His eyes are gone.
What?

01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:35.395
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

01:09:38.946 --> 01:09:42.991
I'm leavin' soon as I'm full.
Y'all havin' too much fun for me.

01:09:43.075 --> 01:09:44.867
Really? Goodbye.

01:09:44.952 --> 01:09:48.569
Well, yeah.
I got a bunch of traps need visitin',

01:09:48.663 --> 01:09:52.282
but I'll be back before...
before dark tomorrow,

01:09:52.376 --> 01:09:55.911
Y'all still be here?
That's my fervent prayer.

01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:59.789
I'll say my goodbyes.
I gotta go.

01:09:59.884 --> 01:10:06.598
I got miles and miles and miles and miles
ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge.

01:10:06.682 --> 01:10:08.924
Blue Ridge? What's the hurry?

01:10:09.018 --> 01:10:12.387
Maybe I will just lie down a moment,
Yeah,

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.142
This house is on a bit of a tilt.
Yeah, it is a bit crooked.

01:10:21.238 --> 01:10:22.898
Lie down.

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:25.066
What about you, Reverend?

01:10:26.577 --> 01:10:29.578
I'm headin' for that smokehouse.

01:10:29.663 --> 01:10:31.989
And I'm ready
to be washed clean of my dirt,

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:35.037
Yeah, Mae, you go tend to him,
Mm-hm.

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.158
All right.

01:10:36.253 --> 01:10:38.827
Y'all get to bed.

01:10:38.923 --> 01:10:41.378
Everybody else got their job.

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:43.460
Come on, get to bed.
Now?

01:10:43.552 --> 01:10:47.087
Everybody to bed.
Lila, you stay with them kids.

01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:49.423
Get on up those stairs.

01:10:49.517 --> 01:10:51.343
I'll be seein' you.

01:10:52.144 --> 01:10:55.181
Look...

01:10:55.272 --> 01:10:59.317
He's mine,
You go rub yourself off on the preacher.

01:10:59.443 --> 01:11:02.978
I'm gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

01:11:03.072 --> 01:11:05.824
He's purty, ain't he?

01:11:06.742 --> 01:11:08.818
Git.

01:11:08.911 --> 01:11:11.912
She ain't even supposed to get a man.

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:16.159
Hey.

01:11:23.592 --> 01:11:25.668
I know, I know.

01:11:27.263 --> 01:11:29.255
I...

01:11:30.516 --> 01:11:32.509
How about that?

01:11:32.601 --> 01:11:35.472
What does that favour?
I...

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:40.309
...gotta go,
Get on.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:44.730
And ride me all the way to China.

01:11:57.585 --> 01:11:58.995
You shy?

01:11:59.086 --> 01:12:01.756
Do you need a hand?
No, Uh...

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:05.089
Let's have a look
and see what we can muster.

01:12:05.885 --> 01:12:08.839
Oh, no,
Look what you made me do.

01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:12.930
Slut.

01:12:13.017 --> 01:12:15.175
Home Guard.

01:12:15.269 --> 01:12:17.012
Cover yourself up.

01:12:17.104 --> 01:12:19.856
I told you, you don't touch the money.

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:28.860
I had a special prayer you'd come visit,

01:12:28.949 --> 01:12:30.907
Get up,
Evenin', Hank.

01:12:30.993 --> 01:12:32.701
Evenin', Hank.

01:12:33.412 --> 01:12:36.449
You took your time,
I said get up.

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:41.540
Get in line.
You fools fall for it every time.

01:12:43.464 --> 01:12:46.631
God will judge you, you Judas,

01:12:46.717 --> 01:12:50.086
Thanks.
God will judge you.

01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:54.841
Move out.
Our lives are on your rotten soul.

01:12:54.934 --> 01:12:56.725
Mister?
Your rotten soul.

01:12:56.811 --> 01:12:58.803
Shut your mouth.

01:13:00.731 --> 01:13:03.602
Pleasure doin' business with you, boys.
Judas.

01:13:03.692 --> 01:13:05.352
Save your breath.

01:13:05.444 --> 01:13:08.231
You got a long walk back to the fightin'.

01:13:13.661 --> 01:13:16.745
Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes,
look at you both.

01:13:16.831 --> 01:13:18.159
Look at us both what?

01:13:18.249 --> 01:13:20.787
Like a couple of scarecrows
after a thunderstorm.

01:13:20.876 --> 01:13:25.088
We need a scarecrow.
Birds done ate up half our winter garden.

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:29.122
For all your kindness, coffee... and a pie.

01:13:29.218 --> 01:13:30.991
Yeah, and that's real coffee.

01:13:31.016 --> 01:13:34.865
It ain't chicory and dirt. Found
a sack hid in the larder.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:37.601
Mmm, Thank you both.

01:13:37.685 --> 01:13:41.683
Ruby, I look forward to this.
We all do.

01:13:41.772 --> 01:13:43.350
Esco and me.

01:13:44.108 --> 01:13:47.192
She made it.
I made it.

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:51.111
Good God in heaven.

01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:53.950
I'm still livin'.

01:13:54.034 --> 01:13:58.447
Well, I know Esco's
gonna be real sorry he missed you.

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:11.331
Yep.

01:14:16.015 --> 01:14:18.932
Strike you as odd?
What?

01:14:19.018 --> 01:14:23.478
Stood at her front door,
I know.

01:14:23.564 --> 01:14:27.644
Number one, I knowed that woman all my
life, I never stood outside her house.

01:14:27.735 --> 01:14:30.938
She'd let a wolf in if
it knocked at the door.

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:32.773
Perhaps...

01:14:32.865 --> 01:14:35.154
I don't know.
Perhaps she was busy.

01:14:35.242 --> 01:14:41.078
Number two, old man Swanger's inside
that house, I could smell his pipe burnin'.

01:14:41.165 --> 01:14:45.743
Number three, look at them fields.
What about them?

01:14:45.836 --> 01:14:50.000
We come by here a week ago
and they was waist-high in hay.

01:14:50.091 --> 01:14:54.302
You tellin' me
that's work for one old man and his dog?

01:15:02.186 --> 01:15:04.344
Yankees. Yankees.

01:15:04.438 --> 01:15:07.060
Cavalry. Federal raiders.

01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:09.189
Just over that hill.

01:15:09.276 --> 01:15:12.277
Get those sacks of shit up that hill.
Come on.

01:15:19.912 --> 01:15:24.491
Get those horses under cover.
If they see us, we're dead.

01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:28.002
Make a move, make a noise...

01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:04.159
I'm gettin' out of this.

01:16:04.248 --> 01:16:08.661
I'm not gettin' shot again
for some cause I don't believe in.

01:16:08.753 --> 01:16:10.496
Come on, let's go.

01:16:10.588 --> 01:16:12.415
Come on, They can't shoot,
Come on.

01:16:16.677 --> 01:16:18.504
Keep goin'. Come on.

01:16:18.596 --> 01:16:20.672
Bayonets.

01:16:22.308 --> 01:16:24.016
Come on.

01:16:53.839 --> 01:16:58.300
Grab their boots and rifles. Let's move on.

01:16:58.385 --> 01:17:00.425
Let's go.

01:17:16.028 --> 01:17:19.777
That scarecrow
ain't gonna frighten off no Yankee.

01:17:19.865 --> 01:17:22.487
Or are you tryin'
to make a man for yourself?

01:17:22.576 --> 01:17:24.154
No.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.078
I come by... a few days.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:32.623
I don't pass by.

01:17:32.711 --> 01:17:35.962
Lookin' out for you.
I know.

01:17:37.716 --> 01:17:39.793
I see you.

01:17:41.095 --> 01:17:44.345
And I don't like it.
Where's your little servant girl?

01:17:44.432 --> 01:17:48.299
Ruby. She tradin' off
more of your daddy's silver?

01:17:48.394 --> 01:17:50.849
Stop it.
Her nose is in the butter.

01:17:50.938 --> 01:17:53.607
Her nose is right in your butter.

01:18:03.451 --> 01:18:05.989
This farm's got my name on it.

01:18:06.078 --> 01:18:09.661
You listenin', woman?
You're gonna need more than a scarecrow.

01:19:38.087 --> 01:19:40.079
Sal.

01:19:50.683 --> 01:19:52.759
Afternoon.

01:19:54.728 --> 01:19:58.180
Don't spread out.
Why are they spreadin' out?

01:19:58.274 --> 01:20:00.895
I never seen a man work a field
with a shotgun before.

01:20:00.985 --> 01:20:02.360
There's a war on.

01:20:02.445 --> 01:20:04.521
Get off my land.

01:20:05.448 --> 01:20:08.899
Your boys come home?
Ain't seen my boys in four years.

01:20:08.993 --> 01:20:11.662
They're out fightin' other boys,
not old men and women.

01:20:11.746 --> 01:20:14.497
So you won't mind if we look around?

01:20:14.582 --> 01:20:16.824
'Cause we think they're here.

01:20:16.917 --> 01:20:19.622
We think you've got 'em
hid up somewhere.

01:20:19.712 --> 01:20:23.875
What I gotta give you?
Chicken? Lamb?

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:26.967
Sure.

01:20:27.052 --> 01:20:30.219
The thing is, you've only got one barrel.

01:20:30.306 --> 01:20:34.054
And there's five of us.
That's not a fair fight.

01:20:37.688 --> 01:20:39.894
King of kings.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.062
Hey.

01:20:43.486 --> 01:20:44.517
What was that?

01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:46.905
Aargh.

01:20:48.574 --> 01:20:52.441
You're harboring deserters. I could
confiscate this farm and everything on it.

01:20:52.536 --> 01:20:55.703
Every plate, every sheep,
every little pellet of chickenshit.

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:58.031
I could confiscate your old lady's asshole.

01:20:58.125 --> 01:20:59.869
So don't you offer me no bird.

01:21:22.608 --> 01:21:25.479
Come on, boys.

01:21:25.569 --> 01:21:27.396
Mama's callin'.

01:21:35.621 --> 01:21:36.617
Mama.

01:21:36.705 --> 01:21:39.541
No.

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:42.163
Mama. Mama.

01:21:43.838 --> 01:21:46.376
No.

01:22:23.169 --> 01:22:25.920
Buggery and shit.

01:22:26.005 --> 01:22:31.628
If I'da known you were this heavy.
I'da left you in those chains.

01:22:50.446 --> 01:22:52.485
Sally.

01:22:53.199 --> 01:22:54.823
No.

01:22:55.659 --> 01:22:57.735
No.

01:22:59.288 --> 01:23:00.747
Oh, God, Sally?

01:23:00.831 --> 01:23:02.160
Ada.

01:23:03.793 --> 01:23:05.785
All right, all right.

01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:10.581
Darlin', what?

01:23:11.425 --> 01:23:14.426
She's sayin' 'Don't bother'. Go.

01:23:18.724 --> 01:23:20.847
Get her neck.

01:23:20.935 --> 01:23:23.508
Sally.
Get her neck.

01:23:27.233 --> 01:23:30.684
This world won't stand long.

01:23:30.778 --> 01:23:32.854
God won't let it...

01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:37.032
stand this way long.

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:48.286
How long have I been sleepin'?
Two days, three days. Not long enough,

01:23:48.379 --> 01:23:52.293
I can't stop here.
Sit down before you fall down.

01:23:52.383 --> 01:23:55.004
I'm a deserter.

01:23:55.094 --> 01:23:58.427
If they find me here,
things could be bad for you.

01:23:58.514 --> 01:24:01.135
What are they gonna do?
Cut short my young life?

01:24:10.025 --> 01:24:13.644
I've learned a person
can pretty much survive off of a goat.

01:24:13.738 --> 01:24:16.608
A goat gives you company,

01:24:16.699 --> 01:24:18.490
and milk,

01:24:18.576 --> 01:24:20.319
and cheese,

01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:23.163
and, when you need it,

01:24:23.247 --> 01:24:25.038
good meat.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.953
That's my beauty.

01:24:30.254 --> 01:24:32.460
There's my beauty.

01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:35.664
So you been fightin'.

01:24:38.429 --> 01:24:41.264
I could be at killin'...

01:24:41.348 --> 01:24:43.008
for days,

01:24:44.185 --> 01:24:47.601
my feet against the feet of my enemy.

01:24:48.689 --> 01:24:50.978
And I always killed him.

01:24:54.695 --> 01:24:56.487
He never killed me.

01:24:56.572 --> 01:25:00.071
I don't know why.

01:25:00.159 --> 01:25:03.195
Gave it a try, to look at ya.

01:25:04.997 --> 01:25:06.990
Yeah, I guess he did.

01:25:07.083 --> 01:25:08.790
See, I think there's a plan.

01:25:08.876 --> 01:25:11.367
There's a design
for each and every one of us.

01:25:11.462 --> 01:25:13.086
You look at nature.

01:25:13.172 --> 01:25:17.917
Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed,
shits the seed out, plant grows.

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.960
Bird's got a job,
shit's got a job, seed's got a job.

01:25:24.809 --> 01:25:27.928
And you've got a job.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.345
You done good, goat.

01:25:31.482 --> 01:25:33.807
You were a real beauty.

01:25:46.038 --> 01:25:49.787
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
when I'm just hungry.

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:54.584
Now drink this,
It eases the pain, and you'll sleep.

01:26:01.887 --> 01:26:05.837
Is she waitin' for ya,
this Ada Monroe?

01:26:05.933 --> 01:26:08.139
She was.

01:26:08.227 --> 01:26:10.979
I don't know.

01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:14.397
Or even if she knows me.

01:26:14.483 --> 01:26:17.235
Lie down.

01:26:17.319 --> 01:26:19.395
I'm like the boy
who goes for wood in winter...

01:26:19.488 --> 01:26:22.655
and comes back in spring with a whistle.

01:26:23.868 --> 01:26:28.197
Like every fool sent off to fight
with a flag and a lie.

01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:35.668
That's the laudanum gettin' to ya.
That's good.

01:26:35.755 --> 01:26:37.794
Say somethin' more.

01:26:42.511 --> 01:26:44.587
She got me a book.

01:26:46.015 --> 01:26:47.972
Ada Monroe.

01:26:50.394 --> 01:26:52.683
A man by the name of Bartram.

01:26:54.690 --> 01:26:56.849
He wrote about his travels.

01:26:57.902 --> 01:27:00.440
Sometimes...

01:27:00.529 --> 01:27:03.614
just readin' the name of a place...

01:27:04.784 --> 01:27:06.860
near home...

01:27:10.956 --> 01:27:13.032
Sorell Cove.

01:27:14.668 --> 01:27:16.791
Bishop's Creek.

01:27:18.339 --> 01:27:21.790
Those places
belonged to people before us.

01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:25.003
To the Cherokee.

01:27:25.096 --> 01:27:29.224
What did he call Cold Mountain?

01:27:31.644 --> 01:27:37.184
How could a name...
not even a real name...

01:27:39.318 --> 01:27:41.690
break your heart?

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:47.817
It's her.

01:27:49.829 --> 01:27:53.529
She's the place I'm headin'.

01:27:55.418 --> 01:27:59.498
And I hardly know her.
I hardly know her.

01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:07.127
And I just can't seem to get back to her.

01:28:11.725 --> 01:28:16.352
'To have traveled so far,
from east to west,

01:28:16.439 --> 01:28:18.727
a thousand terrible miles.'

01:28:18.816 --> 01:28:20.725
I have to close my eyes,

01:28:20.818 --> 01:28:23.772
'My feet treadin' all God's surface -...

01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:28.157
'his ocean, his swamps,
his slopes and ridges -...

01:28:28.242 --> 01:28:34.197
'to find myself, at last,
a mark in the aching snow,

01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:36.911
'from whence I beheld
through a blue haze...

01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:41.045
a world of mountains
piled upon mountains, '

01:28:41.964 --> 01:28:43.957
Ada.

01:28:45.384 --> 01:28:47.377
Ada.

01:28:51.849 --> 01:28:53.842
It's a man.
What is?

01:28:53.934 --> 01:28:58.643
Raidin' our corncrib.
Got him in the trap. That's him yelpin'.

01:29:00.191 --> 01:29:02.895
Help.
Here.

01:29:02.985 --> 01:29:06.603
Help. Damn.

01:29:06.697 --> 01:29:08.773
Listen up.

01:29:08.866 --> 01:29:10.444
You got... Aim.

01:29:10.534 --> 01:29:12.906
You got a barrel trained on your rear end.

01:29:12.995 --> 01:29:16.079
Get me outta this dang thing.
You got a weapon?

01:29:16.165 --> 01:29:21.325
No, ma'am, I'm...
My fists are about to drop off.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:24.623
Unbelievable,

01:29:24.715 --> 01:29:27.835
Stobrod Thewes.
Ruby?

01:29:28.677 --> 01:29:31.513
Agh.

01:29:33.432 --> 01:29:35.508
That's my daddy.

01:29:37.144 --> 01:29:40.015
Just so's you know.
I can eat while she's doin' this.

01:29:40.106 --> 01:29:42.976
Just so's you know,
you ain't eatin' inside.

01:29:43.067 --> 01:29:47.978
Number one, they hang people round here
for takin' in deserters.

01:29:48.072 --> 01:29:52.070
Number two,
even if they was givin' out prizes,

01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:54.829
you'd still eat outside.

01:29:54.912 --> 01:29:57.118
You're scarred.
I'm what?

01:29:57.206 --> 01:30:00.041
Your heart. Scarred,
I did wrong to ya.

01:30:00.126 --> 01:30:01.188
You'd be scarred.

01:30:01.213 --> 01:30:04.397
You'd be real scarred if I hadn't
wrapped them trap teeth in sackin'.

01:30:04.463 --> 01:30:08.081
Which was my idea.
Which was her idea.

01:30:09.135 --> 01:30:12.301
I hurt you.
Good God.

01:30:12.388 --> 01:30:15.591
I made up 50 tunes with you in mind.

01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:18.803
Ruby this, Ruby that,
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.

01:30:18.894 --> 01:30:21.729
Hey. Let's agree.

01:30:21.814 --> 01:30:25.977
You beat me,
you abandoned me, you ignored me,

01:30:26.068 --> 01:30:27.646
then you beat me some more.

01:30:27.737 --> 01:30:32.233
And all of that is better'n
'Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.'

01:30:32.324 --> 01:30:35.160
I'm changed. People change.

01:30:35.244 --> 01:30:37.237
War changes people somethin' terrible.

01:30:37.329 --> 01:30:40.081
Ruby's told you, I've no doubt,
I wasn't always the best.

01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:42.205
You were an asshole.

01:30:42.293 --> 01:30:44.499
I can't disagree with that.
I was.

01:30:45.254 --> 01:30:48.955
Would you get him outta here?
Music's changed me.

01:30:49.049 --> 01:30:51.007
I'm full of music, Ruby.

01:30:51.093 --> 01:30:53.169
I wish I'd brung my fiddle.

01:30:53.262 --> 01:30:55.551
Hey, Ruby, I got a new fiddle.

01:30:55.639 --> 01:31:01.263
Oh, it's a beautiful fiddle. It's full of
tunes, Ruby. I didn't know I had it in me,

01:31:01.353 --> 01:31:04.438
You're all set.
I...

01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:14.813
Bless you both.

01:31:17.536 --> 01:31:19.576
All right, then.

01:31:24.877 --> 01:31:26.953
Ain't you got a proper coat?

01:31:27.922 --> 01:31:29.606
Aw, darlin', I'm fine, you know.

01:31:29.631 --> 01:31:32.524
And you just say the word,
I won't come back neither.

01:31:32.593 --> 01:31:35.428
Don't wanna put you
or your mistress here in any bother.

01:31:35.513 --> 01:31:38.217
I'm not Ruby's employer.

01:31:38.307 --> 01:31:40.216
Oh, Beg pardon.

01:31:40.309 --> 01:31:42.100
Nobody is.

01:31:42.186 --> 01:31:44.262
Oh.

01:31:52.405 --> 01:31:56.188
You know who really needs a coat, darlin'?
My partner, Fat boy name of Pangle.

01:31:56.283 --> 01:31:59.071
We're hidin' up in a cave
with a singer from Georgia,

01:31:59.161 --> 01:32:04.037
and Pangle, he feels the cold like a thin
man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him.

01:32:08.462 --> 01:32:09.743
I love you, Ruby.

01:32:12.591 --> 01:32:16.043
In case the sky falls on our head.

01:32:16.137 --> 01:32:18.806
You always were a good girl.

01:32:29.024 --> 01:32:34.232
Ooh. He's so full of manure, that man.

01:32:34.321 --> 01:32:38.070
We could lay him in the dirt and...
grow another one just like him.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.114
That's medicine, that's goat meat.

01:32:43.456 --> 01:32:45.532
And you're sick of both.

01:32:45.624 --> 01:32:48.993
I have a deal to thank you for.

01:32:49.086 --> 01:32:51.838
That's just for show.

Thank you for my coat.
Thanks for the food.

Git.
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.

01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:14.331
I love my coat.

01:34:26.642 --> 01:34:31.269
'My love for Linton
is like the foliage in the woods.

01:34:31.355 --> 01:34:36.860
'Time will change it, I'm well aware,
as winter changes the trees.

She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she?

01:34:57.798 --> 01:35:02.092
You can't say that about Heathcliff
and then marry Linton.

01:35:02.178 --> 01:35:03.506
Hmm.

01:35:03.596 --> 01:35:06.513
We'll find out.

01:35:09.226 --> 01:35:11.433
Tomorrow.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.854
I'm not waitin' till tomorrow.

01:35:15.608 --> 01:35:17.351
Ruby...

01:35:17.443 --> 01:35:21.986
'A source of... little visible delight,

01:35:29.497 --> 01:35:32.616
I like that.

01:35:59.527 --> 01:36:03.571
I'm a Confederate soldier...
on furlough.

01:36:03.656 --> 01:36:06.740
I need shelter... and food.

01:36:17.461 --> 01:36:19.750
I've got a rifle.

01:36:20.673 --> 01:36:22.547
Fair enough.

01:36:23.884 --> 01:36:26.340
I have some beans and corn pone.

01:36:26.429 --> 01:36:28.587
All I got.

01:36:35.729 --> 01:36:38.018
Thank you.
I'm alone here,

01:36:38.107 --> 01:36:40.645
as you can see, with my baby.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:43.481
I need to believe you mean no harm.

01:36:47.241 --> 01:36:49.068
No.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.366
I don't want it.

01:36:51.454 --> 01:36:55.119
If I had my way, they'd take metal
altogether out of this world.

01:36:55.207 --> 01:36:57.663
Every blade, every gun.

01:37:12.475 --> 01:37:14.348
It's all right.

01:37:14.435 --> 01:37:17.436
You're burnin' up, little man.

01:37:33.913 --> 01:37:35.952
Is your baby sick?

01:37:38.918 --> 01:37:44.160
My man's dead. Took his wound
at Gettysburg and never saw his boy.

01:37:44.256 --> 01:37:45.454
I'm sorry.

01:37:45.549 --> 01:37:49.464
It's pretty much what you'll get
if you knock on any door of this war.

01:37:49.553 --> 01:37:52.340
Man dead, woman left.

01:37:56.769 --> 01:37:58.512
It's mean food, but it's hot.

01:37:58.604 --> 01:38:02.388
There's been no huntin' on the road,
just cress and roots.

01:38:02.483 --> 01:38:05.519
I need to try and feed this man.

01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:09.443
Shh. You gotta eat somethin', baby.

01:38:22.962 --> 01:38:25.535
He won't feed.

01:38:25.631 --> 01:38:29.130
I'm Inman, by the way.
That's my name.

01:38:30.636 --> 01:38:32.712
I'm Sara.

01:38:35.641 --> 01:38:38.677
My baby's Ethan.

01:38:38.769 --> 01:38:40.180
Glad to know you both.

01:38:53.159 --> 01:38:56.278
You look about his size.

01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:59.620
He was another man
straight up and down.

01:38:59.707 --> 01:39:01.699
Thank you.

01:39:28.611 --> 01:39:30.319
Everything fit?

01:39:31.947 --> 01:39:34.154
These boots are good boots.

01:39:41.332 --> 01:39:43.823

Merry Christmas, darlin'.
Don't sleep here,

01:45:04.905 --> 01:45:08.025
We won't,
It's dangerous, Don't sleep here.

01:45:08.117 --> 01:45:12.280
Oh, it's bitter.
They could stop one night.

01:45:12.371 --> 01:45:14.945
They stop one night,
they're gonna wanna stop two.

I'll be all right.
This coat's warm.

01:45:17.501 --> 01:45:20.288
What about next Sunday?
It'll be New Year.

01:45:20.379 --> 01:45:23.499
Maybe.
Gonna be a better one than 1864,

That's what he said a month ago.

01:45:27.636 --> 01:45:30.210
It started off bein' over in a month.

01:45:30.306 --> 01:45:32.927
Night, Miss Sally,
Merry Christmas,

01:45:33.017 --> 01:45:35.768
Night, Miss Ruby.
Night.

01:45:37.021 --> 01:45:38.301
Night, ma'am.
Night.

01:45:38.397 --> 01:45:40.853
You're stayin' with us tonight, Sally,

01:45:40.941 --> 01:45:43.646
That's my Ruby.
She's an original.

01:45:46.697 --> 01:45:52.071
What kind of name's Georgia?
It's where he's from. It's not his name.

01:45:52.161 --> 01:45:57.368
Well, I know it's meant to be
the ugliest state under the heavens.

01:45:57.458 --> 01:46:00.375
Why do you care what his name is?

01:46:01.253 --> 01:46:04.503
Hey, what do you call
that cluster of stars right there?

01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:06.666
Right there.

01:46:06.759 --> 01:46:09.428
Uh... There? That's Orion.

01:46:09.512 --> 01:46:14.754
And that's Gemini,
and that is Orion's big dog.

01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:16.843
Canis Major.

01:46:16.936 --> 01:46:19.094
Listen to her, Sal.

01:46:19.188 --> 01:46:22.438
She's turned into a regular highland girl.

01:46:22.525 --> 01:46:28.148
Nah, I could always name the stars, Ruby.
That was never my problem.

01:46:31.617 --> 01:46:33.693
I love you, darlin',

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:37.740
in case that big old sky
falls on our heads.

01:46:37.832 --> 01:46:39.160
Aw...

01:46:42.461 --> 01:46:46.044
And I love you too, Sally.
I do.

01:46:48.801 --> 01:46:51.339
Get up.

01:46:51.429 --> 01:46:54.880
Get up. Get out of here, quick.
The Yankees are coming.

01:46:54.974 --> 01:46:56.765
The Yankees, they're here.

01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:00.979
If they find you here,
things'll go bad on all of us,

01:47:01.063 --> 01:47:04.562
I can try and fight 'em,
No, My baby, Please, no, just...

01:47:04.650 --> 01:47:06.856
Please, just git.

01:47:18.789 --> 01:47:22.454
We're Union army.
We're lookin' for food.

01:47:22.543 --> 01:47:25.081
Come on, open up. We're hungry.

01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:27.792
I got nothin'. I got nothin'.
We'll see about that.

01:47:30.259 --> 01:47:31.923
There's a baby inside, get it.

01:47:31.948 --> 01:47:34.696
Please, he's sick,
Don't hurt him, please.

01:47:34.764 --> 01:47:36.139
Please, I got nothin'.

01:47:38.893 --> 01:47:43.353
That's right. Take the chickens.
Take the chickens. They're all I got.

01:47:46.525 --> 01:47:48.565
Says she's only got chickens.

01:47:48.652 --> 01:47:52.187
You lyin' Southern trash.

01:47:52.865 --> 01:47:54.941
We're hungry.

01:47:55.034 --> 01:47:56.409
We got all day.

01:47:57.411 --> 01:48:00.365
See, those birds
won't get you through the winter.

01:48:00.456 --> 01:48:02.080
Please cover up my boy.

01:48:02.166 --> 01:48:04.871
Just tell us where the food is,
we'll pick him up.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.582
Please, my baby's sick.

01:48:07.671 --> 01:48:09.747
Please, just cover him up.

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.292
Please, I'm beggin' you.

01:48:13.385 --> 01:48:16.173
Please. Have mercy.

01:48:18.265 --> 01:48:21.017
I got a hog.

01:48:21.102 --> 01:48:22.430
I got a hog.

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.723
He's hid out behind the house.
Take a look.

01:48:27.441 --> 01:48:30.312
Please.

01:48:31.779 --> 01:48:34.317
Please, sir. Please.

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:36.446
He's just a baby.

01:48:38.077 --> 01:48:40.615
He's shaking.

01:48:40.704 --> 01:48:43.278
Please, just cover him up.

01:48:43.374 --> 01:48:47.917
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

01:48:49.547 --> 01:48:52.501
I ain't got nothin' else, I swear,

01:48:52.591 --> 01:48:55.545
That ain't necessarily so.
Yes.

01:48:55.636 --> 01:48:58.388
Take me inside.
We'll do whatever you want.

01:48:58.472 --> 01:49:03.134
Take my baby inside.
Let's all go inside. Please.

01:49:03.227 --> 01:49:06.098
Please. Please.

01:49:06.188 --> 01:49:09.355
You take that hog.
I'm as good as dead.

01:49:09.442 --> 01:49:12.727
Take that hog 'cause I'm as good as dead.

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.978
Shut up.

01:49:20.119 --> 01:49:22.361
No. Agh.

01:49:28.794 --> 01:49:32.128
You know, he's gettin' ready to take a fit.
What do you care?

01:49:46.645 --> 01:49:49.183
Shh... Shh...

01:49:49.273 --> 01:49:51.729
That's better, Shh, That's better.

01:49:55.446 --> 01:49:58.151
Hey, come on,
Leave some for the rest of us.

01:50:09.085 --> 01:50:11.492
Move away from the baby.

01:50:13.255 --> 01:50:15.414
Towards me.

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:18.877
Don't shoot.
We just wanted food.

01:50:18.969 --> 01:50:21.258
Take off your boots.

01:50:22.932 --> 01:50:26.301
Take off your pants.
Take off your shirt.

01:50:33.609 --> 01:50:35.685
Don't shoot me, please.

01:50:37.321 --> 01:50:40.607
We're starvin'.
We haven't eaten in days,

01:50:40.699 --> 01:50:45.243
Come on.
We're starving. We haven't eaten in days.

01:50:45.329 --> 01:50:47.405

Love to.

01:55:18.477 --> 01:55:22.309
We heard there were some deserters up
in these parts hidden out in a big cave.

01:55:22.398 --> 01:55:25.233
Not come to my ears.
So you don't know where this big cave is?

01:55:25.317 --> 01:55:27.310
No, sir.
You do, Stobs. He means...

01:55:27.403 --> 01:55:28.683
No, right. No, no.

01:55:28.779 --> 01:55:32.694
There is a cave right up near Bearpen
Branch. We played some music up there,

01:55:32.783 --> 01:55:37.362
Never occurred to me they were outliers.
It ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch.

01:55:37.455 --> 01:55:39.328

01:55:39.415 --> 01:55:42.167

01:55:42.251 --> 01:55:46.580
I used to freeze up in that cave
till I got gived this new coat.

01:55:46.672 --> 01:55:50.622
Ruby made me this coat.
I like my coat.

01:55:50.718 --> 01:55:54.253
This part belonged to a reverend
and this part belonged to a horse.

01:55:54.346 --> 01:55:58.973
Ruby said... what is it?...
I should pray or neigh, dependin'.

01:55:59.059 --> 01:56:01.301
He don't...
he don't know what he's sayin'.

01:56:01.395 --> 01:56:05.263
He got a mind
no bigger than a pickled walnut.

01:56:05.357 --> 01:56:08.193

01:58:09.023 --> 01:58:12.558
Ruby, she don't know
one end of the war from the other.

01:58:12.651 --> 01:58:15.688
You don't have to worry yourself about her,
is what I'm sayin'.

01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:19.113
Or Ada, neither.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:58:19.742 --> 01:58:22.363
You too.
You stand over there.

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.823
We gonna get our tintype made?

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:36.333
Don't smile.

01:58:36.425 --> 01:58:38.003
What?
Quit smilin'.

01:58:38.094 --> 01:58:40.501
He always smiles,
He don't mean nothin' by it.

01:58:40.596 --> 01:58:43.169
I told him, there ain't nothin'
in this world worth a smile.

01:58:43.265 --> 01:58:45.803
Put your hat over your face.

01:58:52.608 --> 01:58:54.648
Cover your face with your hat.

01:59:03.452 --> 01:59:05.279
Ruby.
What?

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:07.532
Ruby.
What's wrong?

01:59:07.623 --> 01:59:11.074
Teague... The Home Guard...
What?

01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:14.245
They shot your daddy.

01:59:14.338 --> 01:59:16.461
They shot your daddy, and Pangle too.

01:59:22.471 --> 01:59:26.718
I told Georgia he can stop here.
I told him he can sleep in the barn.

01:59:26.809 --> 01:59:30.641
He's got nothin' inside him.
He'll walk out of here and die in the snow.

01:59:30.729 --> 01:59:33.933
He can milk the cows.
I was worried about that.

01:59:36.318 --> 01:59:40.233
It's five hours' climb from here.
He drew a map.

01:59:40.322 --> 01:59:42.315
I'm ready.

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:47.156
You know them fools
stayed the night in the mill?

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:51.326
That's Stobrod Thewes. Can't do
one good thing without addin' the bad.

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:55.878
Left tracks in the snow all the way up
for the Home Guard to follow,

01:59:55.963 --> 01:59:58.288
Sign that says 'Shoot me'.
Ruby...

02:00:01.635 --> 02:00:03.178
Ruby.

02:00:05.473 --> 02:00:07.512
I'm sorry.

02:00:09.518 --> 02:00:12.305
Every piece of this is man's bullshit.

02:00:12.396 --> 02:00:15.018
They call this war a cloud over the land,

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.919
but they made the weather,
and then they stand

02:00:16.944 --> 02:00:19.959
in the rain and say
'Shit, it's rainin'.'

02:00:25.785 --> 02:00:30.992
If I cry one tear for my daddy,
I stole it off a crocodile.

02:00:34.668 --> 02:00:35.748
All right, then.

02:01:25.133 --> 02:01:27.173
All right, then.

02:01:28.431 --> 02:01:31.431
Dear God.

02:01:35.563 --> 02:01:37.721
Oh, dear God.

02:01:43.988 --> 02:01:46.443
He ain't here.

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:50.399
Agh. Teague's probably took him.

02:01:50.494 --> 02:01:54.362
They did that with the Swanger boys,
didn't they?

02:01:54.457 --> 02:01:57.493
Strung 'em up, as a warnin'.

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:04.957
They took his coat.

02:02:05.050 --> 02:02:06.924
Why would they take his coat?

02:02:12.516 --> 02:02:15.683
Daddy? Daddy.

02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:17.727
Daddy.

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:24.934
Daddy?

02:02:25.029 --> 02:02:27.602
He's still breathin'.

02:02:27.698 --> 02:02:30.320
It's Ruby.

02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:32.153
Don't you die on me again.

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:42.462
We gotta get him home,
He won't make it, He'll die first.

02:02:42.546 --> 02:02:45.962
He's got hardly no blood left in him.

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.670
There it is, I feel it.

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:51.842
You got it?
Yep.

02:02:52.723 --> 02:02:57.184
There's a place close.
Old Cherokee, it used to be.

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:59.760
It's got shelter, water.

02:02:59.855 --> 02:03:02.477
I used to hide up there
when he'd get a temper goin'.

02:03:02.566 --> 02:03:04.523
God.

02:03:11.867 --> 02:03:15.995
I'll go look for some food,
Take the shotgun.

02:03:41.939 --> 02:03:43.599
Goddamn.

02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:56.486
Turn around.

02:03:57.997 --> 02:04:00.618
Go back where you came from.

02:04:02.168 --> 02:04:04.540
Go back.

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:10.083
Ada?

02:04:10.843 --> 02:04:12.006
Ada Monroe?

02:04:13.971 --> 02:04:16.758
Turn around or I'll shoot.

02:04:45.252 --> 02:04:46.747
Inman?

02:04:46.837 --> 02:04:48.913
Inman?

02:05:02.103 --> 02:05:04.309
Inman.

02:05:36.429 --> 02:05:38.717
You better come with me.

02:05:51.068 --> 02:05:53.144
Ruby.

02:05:54.071 --> 02:05:55.649
This is Inman.

02:06:00.828 --> 02:06:03.200
Oh. Congratulations.

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:06.824
Oughta send you out with a shotgun
a lot more.

02:06:08.586 --> 02:06:11.752
Looks if he's about to topple over.

02:06:11.839 --> 02:06:14.460
I may need to.
You shot or somethin'?

02:06:16.469 --> 02:06:18.046
Not lately.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:32.607
He's asleep.
I ain't surprised.

02:06:32.693 --> 02:06:36.857
Your man looked tuckered out.
I saw him.

02:06:36.947 --> 02:06:41.360
In Sally Swanger's well.
A man like a black smudge in the snow.

02:06:41.452 --> 02:06:44.488
Well, there you go.
It wasn't the same, what I saw.

02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:46.786
In the well it was as if he were falling.

02:06:46.874 --> 02:06:50.539
You probably just don't remember it right.
I remember it exactly.

02:06:50.628 --> 02:06:52.834
There were crows... black crows.

02:06:52.922 --> 02:06:55.045
They were flyin' towards me.

02:06:55.132 --> 02:06:58.584
Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall.

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:03.931
Instead, I was seein' him come back to me.

02:07:06.435 --> 02:07:09.769
I got big plans for that farm.

02:07:13.776 --> 02:07:16.481
I know.

02:07:16.570 --> 02:07:18.362
I know you have.

02:07:18.447 --> 02:07:22.362
I got a vision in my mind
of how Black Cove oughta be.

02:07:26.497 --> 02:07:28.786
I don't know, Ruby.

02:07:28.874 --> 02:07:33.168
All this while
I've been packin' ice around my heart.

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:38.550
How do I make it melt?

02:07:41.512 --> 02:07:42.971
Hey.

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.891
You about done with my knife?

02:07:46.976 --> 02:07:49.681
We got a bird to cook.

02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:51.562
Just about.

02:07:54.483 --> 02:07:58.267
You're makin' a pig's ear of that job.

02:07:59.739 --> 02:08:01.815
Give it to me.

02:08:07.663 --> 02:08:10.450
Oh, I ain't gonna cut you.

02:08:12.126 --> 02:08:16.337
Can't see that it'd make
a bit of difference if I did.

02:08:27.141 --> 02:08:29.347
You got the right feelings for her?

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:32.685
Don't turn your head. Tsk.

02:08:36.442 --> 02:08:37.770
I do.

02:09:03.344 --> 02:09:06.879
I'm sorry.
I was tryin' to be quiet.

02:09:12.561 --> 02:09:14.933
Did you get my letters?

02:09:16.607 --> 02:09:18.765
I got three letters.

02:09:19.568 --> 02:09:24.361
I carried them.
I carried them in the book you gave me.

02:09:24.448 --> 02:09:25.907
The Bartram.

02:09:27.076 --> 02:09:30.492
I probably sent 103.

02:09:35.167 --> 02:09:37.741
Did you write to me?

02:09:37.837 --> 02:09:39.746
Whenever I could.

02:09:39.839 --> 02:09:42.045
If you never got them, I can summarize,

02:09:42.133 --> 02:09:44.968
No. No, no,
'I pray you are well,

02:09:45.052 --> 02:09:47.341
'I pray I am in your thoughts.

02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:52.672
You are all that keeps me
from slidin' into some dark place.'

02:09:52.768 --> 02:09:55.853
How did I keep you?

02:09:55.938 --> 02:09:58.809
We barely knew each other.
It was a few moments.

02:09:58.899 --> 02:10:00.809
A thousand moments.

02:10:03.612 --> 02:10:07.278
They're like a bag...
of tiny diamonds.

02:10:08.701 --> 02:10:12.319
Don't matter if they're real
or things I made up.

02:10:14.498 --> 02:10:16.705
The shape of your neck.

02:10:18.586 --> 02:10:21.041
That's real.

02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:25.258
The way you felt under my hands
when I pulled you to me.

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:39.225
You were plowing a field.

02:10:40.191 --> 02:10:42.729
You were carrying a tray.

02:10:42.818 --> 02:10:45.605
You wouldn't come in.
No, I wouldn't go in.

02:10:45.696 --> 02:10:50.607
So that's why I had to carry a tray.
So I could come out to see you.

02:10:52.703 --> 02:10:55.787
That kiss.

02:10:55.873 --> 02:10:59.491
Which I kissed every day of my walking.

02:11:01.212 --> 02:11:03.335
Every day I was waiting.

02:11:04.215 --> 02:11:05.625
Longing.

02:11:05.716 --> 02:11:08.800
Longing to see your face.

02:11:15.017 --> 02:11:18.267
If you could see my inside...

02:11:18.354 --> 02:11:23.348
Now, whatever you wanna name it...
my spirit? That's what I fear.

02:11:24.401 --> 02:11:26.359
I think I'm ruined.

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:29.945
They kept tryin' to put me in the ground.

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.869
But I wasn't ready.
Inman...

02:11:33.953 --> 02:11:37.369
But if I had... if I had goodness.
I lost it.

02:11:39.583 --> 02:11:42.833
If I had anything tender in me,
I shot it dead.

02:11:44.505 --> 02:11:48.372
How could I write to you after what I done,

02:11:49.343 --> 02:11:50.422
what I seen?

02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:52.005
Number one,

02:11:52.096 --> 02:11:54.421
shut this door.
It's freezin'.

02:11:54.515 --> 02:11:57.516
Number two, shut that door.
It's freezin'.

02:11:57.601 --> 02:12:00.057
Layin' on my back,
my fingers poked in my ears,

02:12:00.146 --> 02:12:02.850
tryin' to shut out
who's got a bag of diamonds,

02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:05.229
who's carrying a tray...

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:07.690
If you wanna get three
feet up a bull's ass,

02:12:07.778 --> 02:12:11.313
just listen to what sweethearts
whisper to one another.

02:12:11.407 --> 02:12:17.077
In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble
all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him.

02:12:31.886 --> 02:12:34.721
I'll say good night,
No.

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.176
Please...

02:12:41.187 --> 02:12:42.847
don't say good night.

02:13:07.671 --> 02:13:10.459
Wars make some things pointless.

02:13:14.637 --> 02:13:17.009
It's hard to imagine a wedding.

02:13:19.225 --> 02:13:22.594
I think even my father
would recognize that.

02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:25.346
Ada, I wanna marry you.

02:13:27.066 --> 02:13:29.308
If you'll have me.

02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:34.945
Isn't there some religion where you just
have to say 'I marry you' three times,

02:13:35.032 --> 02:13:37.025
and you're man and wife?

02:13:37.993 --> 02:13:40.033
I marry you.

02:13:41.122 --> 02:13:43.328
I marry you, I marry you.

02:13:48.421 --> 02:13:50.460
Why is that funny?

02:13:50.548 --> 02:13:55.174
I think it's 'I divorce you' three times
and you're not married anymore.

02:13:57.179 --> 02:13:58.590
I can wait for you.

02:13:59.223 --> 02:14:04.644
Oh, Inman,
I marry you, I marry you, I marry you.

02:14:04.728 --> 02:14:06.721
I marry you, I marry you.

02:14:14.572 --> 02:14:18.320
I have so...
I have so many buttons, Sorry.

02:14:22.037 --> 02:14:24.825
Will you turn your back?

02:14:36.051 --> 02:14:37.427
No.

02:14:39.722 --> 02:14:42.011
No, I will not.

02:16:27.121 --> 02:16:30.038
I'll lead the horse
at a pace your daddy can tolerate.

02:16:30.124 --> 02:16:33.789
You two go ahead now.
No. I don't wanna do that.

02:16:33.878 --> 02:16:36.629
No. We can all go together.
It's safer this way.

02:16:36.714 --> 02:16:39.039
We're deserters.
No one has a quarrel with you.

02:16:39.133 --> 02:16:41.290
He's right.

02:16:41.385 --> 02:16:45.334
I gather I...
I need permission from you, Ruby,

02:16:45.431 --> 02:16:48.763
if I reckon on livin' at Black Cove.

02:16:57.942 --> 02:16:59.567
All right, then.

02:17:03.531 --> 02:17:05.608
You stay on that horse.

02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:08.737
And don't lose it.
Or sell it.

02:17:09.538 --> 02:17:12.409
Gonna need it back on the farm.

02:17:15.377 --> 02:17:17.454
All right, Daddy.

02:17:21.592 --> 02:17:24.165
I don't wanna let you go.

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:29.379
I'll be with you by nightfall.

02:17:35.064 --> 02:17:36.439
Ugh.

02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:40.477
All right, then.

02:18:11.308 --> 02:18:15.139
Hope that Georgia boy's
been tendin' to the animals.

02:18:15.228 --> 02:18:18.100
I knew you were thinkin' on him.
I was not.

02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:20.598
I was thinkin' on swollen udders.
Oh...

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:24.940
And before you say 'same difference'...
I'm sayin' nothin'.

02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:29.491
Miss Lovey-Dovey.
Miss Lovey-Dovey.

02:18:29.576 --> 02:18:31.616
Hey.

02:18:31.704 --> 02:18:35.832
That was a long funeral for your daddy.
That was a wake.

02:18:35.915 --> 02:18:37.540
That was Irish.

02:18:39.587 --> 02:18:41.495
Now, your friend Georgia here...

02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:45.207
We went down to visit you when
we heard you were harborin' deserters,

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:49.429
and he told us... after some persuasion...
you were up here.

02:18:49.513 --> 02:18:52.384
We were up and down this mountain.

02:18:52.475 --> 02:18:54.266
Up and down.

02:18:54.351 --> 02:18:56.178
There will be a reckoning.

02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:59.306
When this war is over,
there will be a reckoning.

02:19:01.025 --> 02:19:03.101
Did you make this coat?

02:19:03.193 --> 02:19:05.186
Helpin' a deserter... that's treason.

02:19:05.279 --> 02:19:09.858
Now, I know
it's half horse and half reverend.

02:19:11.494 --> 02:19:13.450
A reckonin'?

02:19:15.039 --> 02:19:18.538
The reckoning's for your world.

02:19:18.626 --> 02:19:21.246
It's not mine.

02:19:24.632 --> 02:19:28.048
I'll be damned.
He's a hard bastard to kill.

02:19:30.471 --> 02:19:32.925
No.
Ruby.

02:19:39.772 --> 02:19:41.314
Inman.

02:19:54.995 --> 02:19:56.822
Captain Teague.

02:20:38.956 --> 02:20:42.906
Come down from there.
No, sir. Here is fine.

02:20:43.002 --> 02:20:45.956
I'll just shoot the horse
out from under you.

02:20:46.046 --> 02:20:49.213
You ridin' Captain Teague's animal?
I am.

02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:52.420
He dead?
I hope so.

02:20:52.511 --> 02:20:56.889
Look, give me your gun and ride on home.
I'm done fightin', I'm sick of it.

02:20:56.974 --> 02:20:59.547
I give you my gun,
you're gonna shoot me dead.

02:20:59.643 --> 02:21:02.099
I will not shoot you,
but nor am I goin' down this mountain...

02:21:02.188 --> 02:21:04.346
lookin' over my shoulder for you.

02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.729
That's what they call a conundrum,

02:21:11.238 --> 02:21:15.236
I'll tell you what I got on my side.
What you got on your side?

02:21:22.166 --> 02:21:23.874
The confidence of youth.

02:21:39.266 --> 02:21:41.425
Inman.

02:22:32.778 --> 02:22:34.854
No.

02:23:10.524 --> 02:23:11.722
I...

02:23:12.777 --> 02:23:15.268
came... back.

02:23:24.163 --> 02:23:26.239
I love you.

02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:01.947
Baby.

02:24:27.685 --> 02:24:32.430
What we have lost
will never be returned to us.

02:24:32.523 --> 02:24:35.607
The land will not heal.

02:24:35.693 --> 02:24:38.647
Too much blood.

02:24:38.738 --> 02:24:42.438
The heart will not heal.

02:24:42.533 --> 02:24:46.234
All we can do is make
peace with the past...

02:24:46.328 --> 02:24:48.784
and try to learn from it.

02:24:51.917 --> 02:24:56.247
What are you doing?
He died in the night, love.

02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:59.499
Bring him here.

02:24:59.592 --> 02:25:02.758
Don't kill him,
I'm not gonna kill him.

02:25:02.845 --> 02:25:06.795
We have to try somethin'
or else he's gonna die too.

02:25:06.891 --> 02:25:09.014
It's all right.

02:25:10.478 --> 02:25:13.348
We're gonna try a little trick.

02:25:13.439 --> 02:25:15.894
Shh.

02:25:35.002 --> 02:25:39.249
There are days now
when I manage not to think of you.

02:25:40.508 --> 02:25:45.668
When the needs of the farm
call with more urgency than my heart.

02:25:47.348 --> 02:25:51.346
This time of year
there's so much life everywhere.

02:25:53.229 --> 02:25:55.850
I find you in all of it.

02:25:57.316 --> 02:26:00.934
As if you were still walking home to me.

02:26:03.364 --> 02:26:07.444
If you could see us now
this Easter day at Black Cove,

02:26:07.535 --> 02:26:11.117
you would know
every step of your journey was worth it.
