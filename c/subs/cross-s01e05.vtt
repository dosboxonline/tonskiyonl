he grew up poor.

12:33.378 --> 12:36.505

that he lives now.

When I was 14,
we had this problem in town.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.452
Dead birds popping up all over.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.288
Gutters, churchyards, porches.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.666
All kinds of birds,
but they all had one thing in common.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.169
Their feet had been cut off.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.214
Someone was torturing them.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.591
You think it was Ramsey?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.426
I know it was.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.014

after they took out his tonsils.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.690

13:40.028 --> 13:43.572

13:43.573 --> 13:46.075
- I never told anybody.
- Why not?

13:46.076 --> 13:48.161
Look, the guy's running around
killing birds...

13:49.204 --> 13:51.789
Some of those pics he was always taking?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.416
They were of my dad.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.709
Not with your mother.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.003
If I said anything,
he would've destroyed my family,

13:58.004 --> 13:59.838

13:59.839 --> 14:02.258
Eventually, the bird thing stopped,

14:02.259 --> 14:05.010
so I thought maybe he'd grown out of it
or got scared straight.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.512
- But he didn't, did he?
- I don't know.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.515

you should be talking to.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.564
Ramsey wrote me letters after high school.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.357

He was always talking about

14:18.358 --> 14:21.110
