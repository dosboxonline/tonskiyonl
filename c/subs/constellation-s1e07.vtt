00:46.421 --> 00:47.464
Mamma?

01:02.771 --> 01:03.897
Mamma!

01:59.995 --> 02:01.246
Mamma!

02:02.873 --> 02:03.957
I saw you!

02:18.889 --> 02:20.140
Mamma!

03:05.978 --> 03:08.647
<i>God, this headache, it just--</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:15.487
It's hard. I can't really--
I can't see properly.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.948
Can we play it again?

03:36.592 --> 03:38.010
<i>Jo!</i>

03:42.806 --> 03:44.224
Is that how you remember it?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.561
No.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.774
What's different about it?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.361
We weren't speaking Swedish.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.197
So you don't speak Swedish at all?

03:58.697 --> 04:00.490
I can kind of understand it.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.035
But no, Mummy, I can't speak it.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.120
The way I remember it,
you were speaking English,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.538
and you were talking about the CAL.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.833
The CAL?

04:11.293 --> 04:13.504
You said that they were doing
an experiment.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.797
You told me that--

04:16.882 --> 04:18.800
that Paul was doing an experiment.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.681
Thing is, Alice, I--

04:26.558 --> 04:29.102
I don't remember the CAL
before the accident.

04:30.521 --> 04:34.399
I don't remember anything about it.
I don't--

04:34.399 --> 04:35.859
I don't remember it at all.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.736
What is it?

04:38.820 --> 04:43.742
Henry said it was
something to do with, like, physics.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.664
It's a quantum experiment.

04:50.165 --> 04:54.586
It's supposed to capture
a quantum superposition.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.879
What's that?

04:56.880 --> 05:02.594
Well, it's sort of like when one thing
can exist in two places at the same time.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.619
There's another one with your name on it.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.497
Shall we?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.835
What's the date on it?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.462
"10th of the 15th, 2021."

05:39.131 --> 05:41.842
It's the date after the accident.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.648
<i>Houston, what are the protocols
on dealing with a dead body?</i>

05:56.648 --> 05:58.567
<i>Station, what's your concern?</i>

05:58.567 --> 05:59.776
<i>My concern...</i>

06:00.819 --> 06:01.820
<i>The concern is...</i>

06:03.363 --> 06:05.157
<i>Ericsson is so badly lacerated.</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:08.327
<i>My concern is that
when the body gets out of zero-G--</i>

06:11.455 --> 06:13.040
Maybe we don't need to listen to these.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.293
Maybe I just need to work it out.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.878
Okay.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.131
Mummy?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.883
It's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.261
Just gonna make some pasta for us.
We could just cuddle up, and--

06:26.261 --> 06:27.387
Mummy.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.892
Am I the same to you?

06:38.857 --> 06:39.858
Sorry?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.237
Am I your Alice?

06:51.119 --> 06:54.289
- I...
- Sorry.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.252
Oh, no, you mustn't be sorry, Alice.
It's not--

06:58.252 --> 07:00.212
I just don't feel like you're my mum.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.887
It doesn't feel that way?

07:11.390 --> 07:12.474
No.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.561
But we have to work it out.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.485
We--

07:26.446 --> 07:29.867
We just-- We just need to work it out.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.018
Did you speak to Irena?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.478
She's on her way here.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.232
Why is she on the way here?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.485
Because she's the one
who will take care of your wife.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.575
Jesus Christ.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.290
And sorry, what are you doing here again?

08:18.874 --> 08:21.293
I mean, your machine's no bloody good
to anyone now, is it?

08:22.085 --> 08:26.089
I'm here because
this happened to me as well.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.161
Mamma!

09:06.421 --> 09:08.090
Mamma!

09:11.552 --> 09:13.095
Mamma!

09:46.295 --> 09:47.296
Mamma!

11:28.981 --> 11:30.190
Mamma?

12:21.366 --> 12:22.367
Mamma?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.404
Hey.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.406
Hello?

13:03.659 --> 13:04.952
Mamma!

13:35.816 --> 13:36.817
Help!

13:50.747 --> 13:51.748
Alice?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.041
Mamma.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.879
Alice, baby, talk to me.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.090
Why did you hide in the cupboard?

14:00.757 --> 14:03.010
- Baby?
- I was scared.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.347
Where's Daddy?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.569
You smell like you again.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.989
Who else should I smell like?

14:28.285 --> 14:30.162
This might sting a little bit.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.580
But it's gonna get you warm.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.166
There you go. There you go.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.837
Oh, no. We're out of hot water.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.299
I'm gonna boil you some more.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.550
Don't go.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.845
Don't go.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.421
Mamma. I'm cold.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.434
Mummy?

15:45.779 --> 15:46.780
Mamma?

15:47.990 --> 15:48.991
Mamma!

15:57.583 --> 15:58.584
Mamma?

16:02.254 --> 16:03.463
Mamma!

16:03.463 --> 16:06.341
Alice? I'm here. I'm here.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.679
What happened? Where have you been?

16:10.679 --> 16:11.972
I saw her.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.891
She's there, out in the snow.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.061
Have you been out there in the snow?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.146
I saw Mamma.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.814
She was fine.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.399
She found me.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.276
And now she's gone again.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.907
Honey, if you saw her--
I know you think you did--

16:29.907 --> 16:31.450
It wasn't a dream!

16:32.242 --> 16:33.493
I felt it.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.495
I felt her.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.664
I smelt her.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.125
I felt the snow.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.753
- She was right there.
- She wasn't.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.296
She was. She was right there.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.177
I don't know what to do.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.014
Come on. Let's just get you warm.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.434
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

17:01.939 --> 17:02.940
What?

17:02.940 --> 17:04.691
- Where is she?
- Who?

17:06.068 --> 17:06.902
You.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.445
I don't know what you mean.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.906
Didn't you see yourself?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.992
- In the mirror?
- No! Here.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.744
Mummy, I didn't see anything.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.249
Are you okay?

17:20.249 --> 17:21.959
Get dressed. There's another cabin.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.086
It's like our cabin,
but it's not our cabin.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.420
Is this about the tapes?

17:26.003 --> 17:28.799
Put your snow gear on.
We've got to go across the lake.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.968
Mummy, I'm sorry about what I said.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.054
Get dressed.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.559
Mummy! I didn't mean it!

17:38.559 --> 17:42.062
I'm sorry.
Let's just go back to how we were.

17:45.691 --> 17:48.068
She was hiding in the cupboard upstairs.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.571
Let's go!

17:50.571 --> 17:53.323
It's too cold. She'll freeze.
We gotta find her.

17:54.116 --> 17:54.992
Who?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.703
The other you.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.271
What's this?

18:26.023 --> 18:27.024
Hello there.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.901
The road's completely blocked.

18:31.028 --> 18:33.030
Well, get a digger.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.198
It's coming.

18:35.699 --> 18:36.700
Well, I'm not waiting.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.244
My daughter's stuck out there,
and my wife's crazy.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.295
Mummy, I don't think there is
another cabin.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.005
Come on.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.465
It's this way.

18:51.465 --> 18:52.716
I'm sure it's this way.

18:53.509 --> 18:54.510
Come on.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.304
I think-- I think--

19:00.265 --> 19:01.266
What?

19:02.684 --> 19:07.105
People can see things sometimes
when they're upset.

19:08.941 --> 19:13.362
People who have been to space before
have seen things.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.963
I don't wanna hurt you...

19:32.965 --> 19:38.262
I really don't wanna make you upset,
but I think you're right...

19:42.015 --> 19:43.725
I don't think you're my daughter.

19:46.770 --> 19:50.357
But, if I'm not, then who are you?

19:52.401 --> 19:53.944
What have you done to my mummy?

19:55.988 --> 19:57.447
Let's find out together.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.288
Alice.

20:05.289 --> 20:08.333
You're crazy! I want Daddy!
I want to go home to Daddy!

20:08.333 --> 20:09.751
Alice, wait!

20:13.964 --> 20:15.132
Alice!

20:36.737 --> 20:38.155
Alice, wait!

20:42.743 --> 20:43.911
Alice!

21:07.935 --> 21:08.936
Alice?

21:10.521 --> 21:11.563
Alice?

21:22.241 --> 21:24.117
Oh, Christ. Not again.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.168
Mamma!

21:39.216 --> 21:40.259
Alice!

21:51.395 --> 21:52.396
Alice!

22:48.911 --> 22:49.995
Mamma!

23:09.097 --> 23:10.140
Mummy!

23:11.391 --> 23:13.018
I think I found it.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.941
I've found the other cabin.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.240
Mummy?

24:38.770 --> 24:39.813
Alice?

25:24.650 --> 25:25.651
Alice?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.903
Alice, can you hear this?

25:46.380 --> 25:48.131
<i>Alice, can you hear this?</i>

26:01.436 --> 26:02.271
<i>Alice?</i>

26:04.940 --> 26:07.943
If you can hear this, say something.

26:10.070 --> 26:13.198
<i>If you can hear this, say something.</i>

26:28.172 --> 26:29.006
Hello?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.008
<i>Hello?</i>

26:42.895 --> 26:43.937
What?

26:53.614 --> 26:54.615
Alice!

26:58.577 --> 26:59.828
Alice!

27:02.080 --> 27:03.081
Alice!

27:03.665 --> 27:06.710
Alice, if you're not here,
I'm gonna have to call the police.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.131
Hello, Alice?

27:16.428 --> 27:17.554
<i>Where are you?</i>

27:23.393 --> 27:26.730
At the cabin. Kind of. Upstairs.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.108
Alice, that's enough.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.200
<i>Is it our cabin?</i>

27:39.743 --> 27:41.245
It's like our cabin...

27:43.705 --> 27:46.124
- <i>Are you in the cupboard?</i>
- Yes.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.507
I can't see you.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.643
<i>It's not the same cupboard, I guess.</i>

28:22.119 --> 28:24.454
<i>But we're the same Alice?</i>

28:26.540 --> 28:27.541
<i>Don't know.</i>

28:29.877 --> 28:31.128
<i>Is there a mirror there?</i>

28:33.172 --> 28:34.214
<i>Yes.</i>

28:37.676 --> 28:40.512
If you look in, I will too.

28:49.605 --> 28:52.024
<i>Shit. We've locked ourselves in.</i>

28:53.233 --> 28:54.526
<i>What?</i>

28:54.526 --> 28:55.986
<i>We've locked ourselves in.</i>

29:00.532 --> 29:01.533
<i>Hello?</i>

29:02.576 --> 29:03.869
Do you speak English?

29:05.871 --> 29:07.331
My daughter is missing.

29:08.081 --> 29:11.126
We're in a cabin
on the north side of Älmedalen.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.883
She-She's ten years old.
I need you to come quickly.

29:30.938 --> 29:33.440
She's gone out on the lake. Is that safe?

29:35.567 --> 29:36.818
Well, that's where she's gone.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.200
She thinks she can find her mamma.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.560
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

30:22.614 --> 30:23.657
Is that you?

30:30.455 --> 30:31.874
Are we the same?

30:34.543 --> 30:35.919
What are you doing here?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.214
Looking for my mum.

30:40.257 --> 30:41.425
Have you seen her?

30:42.593 --> 30:43.594
Yeah.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.805
She came and took me out of this cupboard.

30:49.933 --> 30:50.976
<i>This cupboard?</i>

30:52.019 --> 30:53.020
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:55.439 --> 30:57.107
<i>Are you staying at the cabin?</i>

30:58.567 --> 30:59.568
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

31:01.486 --> 31:03.280
<i>Is your mamma staying there with you?</i>

31:07.868 --> 31:08.911
She can't.

31:10.204 --> 31:11.538
Why not?

31:12.998 --> 31:14.333
'Cause she's dead.

31:55.707 --> 31:56.792
Hello?

32:03.799 --> 32:04.675
Sorry.

32:05.592 --> 32:06.760
That's okay.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.390
<i>When did she die?</i>

32:12.975 --> 32:16.353
<i>In space. She's still up there.</i>

32:16.353 --> 32:18.480
<i>Did she speak Swedish with you?</i>

32:20.065 --> 32:21.066
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:23.777 --> 32:25.404
What color is your car?

32:27.739 --> 32:28.574
Red.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.618
<i>Is your mamma dead too?</i>

32:34.705 --> 32:41.587
I think it's your mamma who's alive
and my mummy who died.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.798
I think they swapped places.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.427
Alice?

32:52.431 --> 32:53.932
Can I have her back?

33:22.002 --> 33:23.337
So, what happened?

33:23.337 --> 33:25.339
What was it, like a breakdown?

33:26.048 --> 33:28.217
I was up there on the command module.

33:28.217 --> 33:30.093
Just come back from the moon.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.721
Sixteen hours in,
there was a depressurization.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.432
My crew...

33:36.141 --> 33:38.185
It looked to me like they were dead.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.728
I kinda blacked out.

33:40.395 --> 33:43.357
The miracle happened when I came to,
they were okay again.

33:45.192 --> 33:47.110
When I came back to Earth, I wasn't.

33:48.570 --> 33:51.240
- So, how'd you get better?
- I took the pills...

33:52.783 --> 33:54.535
and I threw myself into my work.

33:55.494 --> 33:56.620
And how long did it take?

33:59.957 --> 34:01.792
We're ready. You coming?

34:08.632 --> 34:09.882
Ready!

34:14.596 --> 34:16.556
- Alice!
- Alice!

35:19.578 --> 35:20.579
Alice!

36:27.020 --> 36:28.188
Alice?

36:42.870 --> 36:43.871
Hello?

36:49.126 --> 36:50.127
It's me.

36:51.170 --> 36:53.005
Not the one who speaks Swedish.

36:56.049 --> 36:56.884
Well, we need to--

36:56.884 --> 36:58.594
<i>Where are you?</i>

37:01.305 --> 37:03.265
I've got Mamma here.

37:03.891 --> 37:04.892
<i>In the cupboard?</i>

37:07.102 --> 37:09.146
No. She's here.

37:11.273 --> 37:12.441
<i>I can't see her.</i>

37:13.650 --> 37:14.860
<i>I can't hear her.</i>

37:17.529 --> 37:18.530
Alice?

37:19.531 --> 37:21.408
I think you have to speak through me.

37:33.462 --> 37:34.630
<i>Shut up.</i>

37:35.881 --> 37:36.882
<i>Shut up!</i>

37:47.226 --> 37:48.644
<i>I'm coming to get you, Henry.</i>

37:50.312 --> 37:51.730
<i>Sooner or later.</i>

37:53.273 --> 37:54.358
<i>I'm comin'.</i>

37:55.526 --> 37:58.904
<i>And boy, am I gonna fuck things up.</i>

38:08.497 --> 38:09.581
Alice!

38:11.208 --> 38:12.209
Alice!

38:15.045 --> 38:16.296
Alice!

38:18.966 --> 38:20.092
Alice!

38:28.684 --> 38:29.685
Alice!

38:43.115 --> 38:44.116
She says...

38:51.832 --> 38:53.625
I love you.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.963
She says she loves you.

38:58.714 --> 39:01.300
<i>I love you too.</i>

39:04.720 --> 39:06.805
<i>Can I see her in the mirror?</i>

39:09.516 --> 39:10.517
Alice?

39:16.523 --> 39:17.566
Alice?

39:18.859 --> 39:21.028
Can you hear me?

39:25.699 --> 39:27.075
She can't.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.334
She says, "When are you coming home?"

39:38.003 --> 39:40.422
I don't know if I can come home.

39:41.590 --> 39:45.052
She says she doesn't know
if she can come home.

39:46.762 --> 39:48.764
<i>Why not?</i>

39:49.348 --> 39:52.309
Becau-- Because I don't--

39:53.310 --> 39:55.479
I don't know how to.

39:56.146 --> 40:00.150
I might-- I just need to work it out.

40:01.652 --> 40:03.987
Tell her I will work it out.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.199
She doesn't know how.

40:07.783 --> 40:09.243
She just needs to work it out.

40:09.243 --> 40:10.744
She'll work it out.

40:35.644 --> 40:36.478
Yeah?

40:36.478 --> 40:38.355
<i>Commander Caldera?</i>

40:38.355 --> 40:39.857
<i>I prefer Bud.</i>

40:39.857 --> 40:41.608
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Henry, listen!

40:42.359 --> 40:43.527
<i>Henry?</i>

40:43.527 --> 40:46.780
<i>I don't use that name.
My name is not Henry.</i>

41:06.758 --> 41:07.801
Mamma.

41:09.261 --> 41:10.179
Alice.

41:10.679 --> 41:12.097
It is cold.

41:13.724 --> 41:14.766
Baby.

41:14.766 --> 41:15.976
I'm sleepy.

41:22.357 --> 41:23.734
I'm scared.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.444
It's gonna be okay.

41:25.986 --> 41:27.279
Mamma.

41:27.279 --> 41:28.488
Alice.

41:31.283 --> 41:34.119
Alice, talk to me.

41:43.295 --> 41:44.296
Come.

42:02.189 --> 42:04.316
- <i>Tell me what happened.</i>
- <i>This is what happened.</i>

42:04.316 --> 42:05.692
- Fucking hands off--
- I'm not taking shit!

42:05.692 --> 42:06.818
<i>You get out!</i>

42:14.368 --> 42:17.996
Commander Caldera,
you tell me why you're here.

42:18.539 --> 42:20.916
- Why the fuck are you here?
- No, wait! Hey!

42:39.184 --> 42:41.603
Henry! Henry!

42:42.980 --> 42:44.982
Here, take her.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.404
I've gotta find my daughter!

43:07.045 --> 43:08.297
Oh, God, no.

43:09.631 --> 43:10.632
Paul.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.135
Paul! It's Henry.

43:13.135 --> 43:14.428
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:14.428 --> 43:17.514
Oh, God. You stay with me.
You stay with me.

43:25.689 --> 43:27.482
Oh, come on.

43:28.901 --> 43:32.362
911? They need an ambulance.
It's a gunshot wound.

43:32.362 --> 43:34.031
<i>Yes, to the stomach.</i>

43:34.531 --> 43:38.327
What? Address. Goddamn address.

43:39.912 --> 43:42.873
Los Angeles.
Los-Los Angeles somewhere. What--

43:44.917 --> 43:46.335
Christ, my glasses.

43:48.253 --> 43:50.714
60-- Stay with me, Paul.

43:50.714 --> 43:54.885
60556 Lexington Avenue.

43:56.094 --> 43:57.095
Yeah.

43:59.139 --> 44:00.182
Caldera.

44:01.558 --> 44:03.977
Bud.

44:11.777 --> 44:13.445
Who the fuck are you, kid?

44:16.490 --> 44:17.991
Oh, my God, it's cold.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.829
I'm just in my underwear.

44:27.543 --> 44:28.544
Help!

44:32.714 --> 44:34.007
Alice?

44:38.053 --> 44:39.054
Alice.

45:29.188 --> 45:30.272
Alice?

45:33.817 --> 45:36.445
Alice. Alice. Baby.

45:38.071 --> 45:38.989
Alice.

45:51.668 --> 45:52.878
Come on.

45:54.338 --> 45:55.422
Baby!

45:55.422 --> 45:57.090
I made you one of these.

46:14.191 --> 46:15.984
I have to save her.

46:21.156 --> 46:22.157
Come on.

46:24.785 --> 46:25.994
Mamma?

46:27.496 --> 46:29.623
- I can't feel her anymore.
- Okay.

46:30.123 --> 46:31.416
I think she's dead.

46:33.210 --> 46:35.379
Come on. Come on!

46:44.054 --> 46:45.055
Alice!

46:45.848 --> 46:47.307
Alice!

46:53.272 --> 46:54.273
It's Daddy.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.698
Go to him.

47:07.703 --> 47:09.288
But I'm your Alice.

47:11.915 --> 47:13.083
Yeah.

47:13.083 --> 47:15.210
Go to Papa. Okay?

47:27.472 --> 47:28.473
Jo?

47:32.895 --> 47:34.771
I love you, Mamma.

47:37.274 --> 47:39.151
I love you too.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.280
Alice! This way!

47:44.156 --> 47:45.157
Alice.

47:57.669 --> 47:58.670
Alice!

48:03.509 --> 48:04.510
Alice.

48:05.969 --> 48:07.262
Are you okay?

48:07.971 --> 48:08.972
Hi, Daddy.

48:10.974 --> 48:11.975
Come on!

48:13.435 --> 48:14.269
Okay.

48:15.854 --> 48:17.564
What the fuck did you do?

48:18.398 --> 48:19.399
Wha--

48:19.399 --> 48:22.361
Who was-- Were you with someone?

48:23.779 --> 48:25.531
I'm so cold.

48:25.531 --> 48:28.450
Come on. Okay.
Come here. I got you. How's that?

48:37.709 --> 48:39.211
It's okay, baby.

48:40.379 --> 48:41.672
Alice?

48:43.590 --> 48:44.758
Alice?

48:51.098 --> 48:52.099
Alice, baby...

48:56.728 --> 49:00.232
Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice!

49:01.900 --> 49:02.901
Alice!

49:46.236 --> 49:49.281
Do not do that to me ever again.

49:50.199 --> 49:51.283
Okay, baby?

49:52.284 --> 49:53.285
Ever.

49:53.285 --> 49:55.370
But I saw Mamma.

49:55.996 --> 49:57.623
She told me to come to you.

49:59.750 --> 50:01.084
Didn't you see her?

50:03.462 --> 50:04.630
Did you see her?

50:06.798 --> 50:07.799
I--

50:11.428 --> 50:12.513
I don't know.

51:04.273 --> 51:05.274
Hello?

51:12.698 --> 51:13.699
Hello?

51:14.449 --> 51:16.869
You want to see your mamma?

51:25.127 --> 51:28.714
Come with me,
and I'll take you to your mamma.

51:29.923 --> 51:31.049
Who are you?

51:31.884 --> 51:33.427
She's not far away.

51:34.928 --> 51:36.305
Where is she?

51:36.805 --> 51:38.640
Come with me, child.

51:42.019 --> 51:43.854
Come away, child.

51:51.528 --> 51:52.529
Daddy?

51:53.864 --> 51:54.865
I'm here, honey.

51:55.490 --> 51:56.533
I'm right here.

52:00.370 --> 52:01.705
Where is she?

52:04.041 --> 52:05.417
She's gone to get help.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.171
Who for?

52:11.215 --> 52:12.216
I'm so sorry.

52:13.884 --> 52:15.844
I should never have let you
be alone with her.

52:17.596 --> 52:19.348
Who did she go away with?

52:21.058 --> 52:23.519
A woman called Irena Lysenko.

52:26.355 --> 52:27.940
A cosmonaut?

52:29.858 --> 52:30.859
I think so.

52:31.777 --> 52:32.778
Once.

52:45.123 --> 52:46.875
We need to get her back.
