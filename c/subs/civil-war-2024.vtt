WEBVTT

00:40.157 --> 00:44.227
We are now
closer than we've ever been.

00:44.329 --> 00:49.298
We are now closer than
we have ever been to victory.

00:50.535 --> 00:52.332
Some...

00:52.434 --> 00:57.135
Some are already
calling it the greatest...

00:57.938 --> 01:02.174
Some are already
calling it the greatest victory

01:02.276 --> 01:06.777
in the history
of mankind.

01:14.959 --> 01:16.754
Some are calling it already...

01:20.331 --> 01:23.232
We are closer than
we have ever been to victory.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.233
Some are already calling it
the greatest victory

01:26.335 --> 01:29.206
in the history
of military campaigns.

01:35.374 --> 01:37.144
Today, I can announce

01:37.246 --> 01:39.914
that the so-called
Western Forces

01:40.016 --> 01:42.082
of Texas and California

01:42.185 --> 01:44.588
have suffered
a great loss.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.651
A very great defeat

01:46.753 --> 01:49.221
<i>at the hands
of the fighting men and women</i>

01:49.324 --> 01:50.854
<i>of the United States military.</i>

01:52.295 --> 01:54.527
<i>The people
of Texas and California</i>

01:54.629 --> 01:57.129
<i>should know that they will be
welcomed back</i>

01:57.231 --> 01:58.897
<i>to these United States</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:03.668
<i>as soon as their illegal
secessionist government
is deposed.</i>

02:03.770 --> 02:07.008
<i>I can also confirm
that the Florida alliance</i>

02:07.110 --> 02:08.639
<i>has failed in its attempt</i>

02:08.742 --> 02:11.815
<i>to force the brave people
of the Carolinas</i>

02:11.918 --> 02:13.613
<i>into joining the insurrection.</i>

02:14.754 --> 02:16.517
<i>Citizens of America,</i>

02:16.619 --> 02:21.125
<i>we are now closer than ever
to a historic victory.</i>

02:21.227 --> 02:24.721
<i>As we eliminate
the final pockets of resistance,</i>

02:24.824 --> 02:28.727
<i>God bless you all
and God Bless America.</i>

03:50.712 --> 03:54.549
Give us some water!
Give us some water!

03:57.122 --> 03:58.920
We've been waiting
for two hours.

04:06.428 --> 04:09.126
PEOPLE
We want water!

04:09.228 --> 04:10.631
My baby!

04:16.940 --> 04:17.902
Lee.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.192
No!

05:03.417 --> 05:04.784
You all right?

05:15.130 --> 05:16.426
Help!

05:19.332 --> 05:20.965
Here, here.

05:22.235 --> 05:23.638
You okay?

05:24.402 --> 05:26.073
I'm fine.

05:26.175 --> 05:27.107
- What?
- What?

05:27.209 --> 05:28.577
You're Lee Smith?

05:29.982 --> 05:32.413
This is crazy.

05:32.515 --> 05:34.852
- Take this.
- Oh, no, I can't do that.

05:34.954 --> 05:37.019
Take it and put it on.

05:38.451 --> 05:39.984
Thank you so much.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.019
Run!

07:02.307 --> 07:04.371
You woke up
in Des Moines, Iowa.

07:04.474 --> 07:06.339
And he's wearing
my wedding ring.

07:06.441 --> 07:08.545
- Hey!

07:14.220 --> 07:17.086
Jesus. The wifi
is fucking slow.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.954
The word I'm getting,

07:19.056 --> 07:20.089
it's July 4th.

07:20.191 --> 07:21.791
The word you're getting.

07:21.893 --> 07:24.487
Like everyone in this room
hasn't already
heard his bullshit.

07:24.589 --> 07:26.426
July 4th, Sam.

07:26.528 --> 07:29.159
The optics
are irresistible.

07:29.261 --> 07:31.962
The Western Forces
are stopped 120 miles from D.C.

07:32.065 --> 07:34.304
The Florida Alliance
aren't far south of that.

07:34.406 --> 07:36.799
The WF wasn't stopped.
They stalled.

07:36.902 --> 07:38.735
They lost
their supply lines.

07:38.837 --> 07:40.170
What is the race to Berlin?

07:40.272 --> 07:43.340
There's no coordination
between the secessionists.

07:43.443 --> 07:44.878
You watch.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.485
As soon as D.C. falls,
they'll turn on each other.

07:50.318 --> 07:51.621
Really?

07:52.522 --> 07:53.589
It's every night
this week.

07:53.691 --> 07:55.751
- Ugh.
-They'll switch
to the generator.

07:55.853 --> 07:57.726
Upload was almost done.

08:02.697 --> 08:05.096
So where you kids
headed tomorrow?

08:07.166 --> 08:09.540
Staying in New York a while
or venturing out?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.106
Fuck you.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.676
- Come on, Joe.
- So you can beat us there?

08:16.778 --> 08:19.176
I couldn't beat you
in a brisk walk.

08:21.385 --> 08:25.017
We're going to
D.C., Sammy.

08:25.819 --> 08:27.751
Tomorrow morning,
first thing.

08:27.853 --> 08:29.291
Yeah, front line, I figured.

08:29.393 --> 08:31.221
No, no,
not the frontline.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.026
D.C.

08:42.006 --> 08:42.933
What?

08:43.035 --> 08:44.938
I'm gonna photograph
the president.

08:46.376 --> 08:48.510
Joe's gonna
interview.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.012
Photograph
and interview the president?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.583
In D.C.?

08:55.020 --> 08:56.048
That's the idea.

08:56.150 --> 08:59.623
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Are you serious?

09:01.694 --> 09:03.691
They shoot journalists
on the side in the capital.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.824
They literally see us
as enemy combatants.

09:05.926 --> 09:09.259
Not a single interview
in 14 months.

09:10.336 --> 09:11.599
And how are you
gonna do this?

09:11.701 --> 09:14.836
We get there
before anyone else does.

09:15.603 --> 09:16.867
You think there's a rush

09:16.969 --> 09:19.539
to get executed
on the soft lawn?

09:19.641 --> 09:21.772
Sam, July 4th,
July 10th.

09:21.874 --> 09:24.414
Westcoast Forces,
fuckin'

09:24.516 --> 09:27.146
Heartland Maoists,
it's all the same.

09:27.248 --> 09:30.885
D.C. is falling
and the President
is dead inside the...

09:32.623 --> 09:34.556
Interviewing him
is the only story left.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.155
It's not a story
if it never gets filed.

09:39.357 --> 09:41.764
Lee, can I please
talk you out of this bullshit?

09:44.328 --> 09:46.136
What do you think
the route's gonna be like?

09:46.238 --> 09:47.631
There's nothing direct.

09:47.733 --> 09:50.773
The interstates have vaporized.
And you can't get
anywhere near Philly.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.838
So you gotta go west,
maybe as far as Pittsburgh.

09:52.940 --> 09:56.273
Then circle in
from West Virginia.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.749
You already had that route
all figured out, huh, Sammy?

10:01.920 --> 10:05.385
Yeah, okay, I was kind of
looking to get
down there myself.

10:05.487 --> 10:07.755
- Knew it.
- Not D.C.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.525
I don't want a piece
of your suicide pact.

10:10.627 --> 10:12.856
I want Charlottsville, frontline.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.464
- Sam.
-Hear me out.

10:14.566 --> 10:15.694
Just 'cause
I'm a rival news outlet...

10:15.797 --> 10:17.327
You're not
a fucking rival.

10:17.429 --> 10:19.532
You think I care if you
fight with whatever's left

10:19.634 --> 10:20.803
of <i>The New York Times?</i>

10:23.771 --> 10:25.742
You're worried
I'm too old.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.942
Can't move quick enough.

10:29.741 --> 10:31.110
Aren't you?

10:32.116 --> 10:33.509
Sure.

10:33.611 --> 10:34.883
Yes.

10:35.614 --> 10:36.819
But...

10:39.451 --> 10:43.723
You're gonna make me
explain why I have to be there?

10:43.825 --> 10:47.426
If it's the frontline you want,
half the press in this room
are gonna be heading there

10:47.528 --> 10:48.999
within 24 hours.

10:49.101 --> 10:52.395
You want me to walk around
this flipping room
begging for a ride?

10:55.434 --> 11:00.171
I'm gonna
finish the upload upstairs
and pass out.

11:00.273 --> 11:02.913
Hopefully it'll be time
by the time I wake up.

11:06.986 --> 11:07.949
My vote,

11:09.016 --> 11:11.320
if Sammy wants a ride,
I'm good with it.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.189
You two figure it out.

11:13.291 --> 11:14.252
Thank you, Lee.

11:15.459 --> 11:16.452
Yeah, thank you, Lee.

11:17.262 --> 11:18.256
Make me the bad guy.

11:21.026 --> 11:22.360
Ma'am, just a warning.

11:22.462 --> 11:24.930
If you take the elevator,
we do sometimes have power cuts

11:25.032 --> 11:26.770
which might mean
a delay in your journey.

11:27.468 --> 11:28.505
A delay?

11:28.607 --> 11:30.202
We offer the option
to use the stairs.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.072
I'm on the tenth floor.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.812
Your choice, ma'am.

11:42.485 --> 11:43.721
Miss Smith?

11:45.322 --> 11:46.889
Hey, it's me.

11:47.889 --> 11:49.656
Do you
remember me from earlier?

11:49.759 --> 11:51.088
Yeah. How did you know
I was...

11:51.190 --> 11:55.126
I didn't mean
to, like, stalk, but, um,

11:55.228 --> 11:57.093
I know a lot of the press
use this hotel.

11:57.195 --> 12:00.800
And, um, I wanted
to say thanks.

12:00.902 --> 12:03.439
And I want
to give you this back.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.670
Oh, no.
It's okay, keep it.

12:05.772 --> 12:06.737
- But...
- Keep it.

12:06.839 --> 12:08.245
And buy
a helmet.

12:08.347 --> 12:09.605
And some Kevlar, okay,

12:09.707 --> 12:11.776
if you're planning
on attending
more stuff like that.

12:11.878 --> 12:13.280
I am, yeah, going to.

12:13.382 --> 12:16.820
I'm a photographer
and I wanna be
a war photographer actually.

12:18.252 --> 12:21.355
By the way, you have
the same name as my hero.

12:21.457 --> 12:22.724
Lee Miller.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.622
She was one of the first
photo journalists

12:24.724 --> 12:25.922
into Dacau.

12:26.024 --> 12:26.991
Do you know her stuff?

12:27.093 --> 12:29.395
Yeah, I know
who Lee Miller is.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.460
Of course.

12:30.562 --> 12:35.197
But I want to say
that you're also
one of my heroes.

12:35.299 --> 12:38.842
And you've got
the same name too.

12:39.473 --> 12:40.477
Wow.

12:40.579 --> 12:42.780
Thank you.
I'm in good company.

12:44.978 --> 12:47.312
- What's your name?
- Jessie.

12:47.879 --> 12:49.183
Jessie Collin.

12:49.285 --> 12:53.252
So, Jessie,
I've gotta walk up
ten flights of stairs.

12:54.658 --> 12:56.925
But, if I ever see you again,

12:57.027 --> 12:59.830
you better be wearing Kevlar
and not fluorescent.

13:01.727 --> 13:02.899
You bet.

15:13.661 --> 15:14.657
A word.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.101
What the fuck
is that girl doing here?

15:19.203 --> 15:22.070
Right. So, she came over
to the table last night

15:22.172 --> 15:24.271
after you went to bed
and we got talking and...

15:24.904 --> 15:26.839
She's very cool.

15:26.941 --> 15:28.143
And wanted to tag along.

15:29.075 --> 15:30.877
So she's coming with us?

15:30.980 --> 15:32.813
Lee, you let Sammy
tag along.

15:32.915 --> 15:37.413
You think he's gonna do well
running for cover with bullets
flying over his head?

15:37.515 --> 15:39.453
She's a kid,
did you notice that?

15:39.822 --> 15:41.223
She's, like, 23,

15:41.325 --> 15:44.489
and she wants to do what we do.
She wants to do what you do.

15:46.224 --> 15:47.723
We had to start one day.

15:48.801 --> 15:50.528
Were you much older
than she is now?

15:59.377 --> 16:02.738
Whatever happens,
she goes no further
than Charlottesville.

16:10.082 --> 16:12.748
All right. Let's go.

16:50.322 --> 16:51.787
You don't want to miss this.

18:11.408 --> 18:14.074
Mr. President, do you regret
any actions implemented

18:14.176 --> 18:16.374
during your third term
in office?

18:16.476 --> 18:18.710
I'm not gonna
softball him, Sammy.

18:18.812 --> 18:22.145
In retrospect, Mr. President,
do you still think it was wise

18:22.247 --> 18:23.718
to disband the FBI?

18:23.820 --> 18:25.381
Passive aggressive.

18:25.483 --> 18:30.089
Sir, how is your policy evolving
in the use of air strikes
against American citizens?

18:30.191 --> 18:31.620
Now we're talking.

18:31.722 --> 18:33.358
Just be sure
you get the words out

18:33.460 --> 18:35.627
before the piano wire
gets too tight.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.698
There's a gas station
up ahead.

18:42.838 --> 18:43.866
Looks open.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.543
We got
over half a tank.

18:58.184 --> 18:59.717
What do you think?

19:02.621 --> 19:05.427
Any chance to refuel,
we should take.

19:05.629 --> 19:06.790
Okay.

19:34.287 --> 19:35.824
Help you, folks?

19:35.926 --> 19:37.491
Just looking for gas.

19:40.227 --> 19:42.595
Y'all look fuel permit.

19:42.697 --> 19:45.763
No, we're...
We're actually just
passing through.

19:47.804 --> 19:48.832
Can't help, sir.

19:50.302 --> 19:52.271
Sir, if we pay.

19:52.373 --> 19:54.544
I was never gonna
give it free.

19:54.646 --> 19:55.745
Over the odds.

19:55.847 --> 19:56.942
What's over the odds?

19:57.044 --> 19:58.574
Three-hundred.

19:58.676 --> 20:00.549
For half a tank
and two cans.

20:02.648 --> 20:04.486
Three hundred buys you
a sandwich.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.455
We got ham or cheese.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.622
Three hundred Canadian.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.792
Okay.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.399
Hey.

20:23.501 --> 20:24.536
Stretching your legs?

20:24.638 --> 20:27.074
Uh, no, I just saw something
from the road.

20:27.177 --> 20:28.542
This isn't going
to take long.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.412
Sure.

20:46.962 --> 20:47.957
Are we good?

20:49.493 --> 20:50.663
Yeah, we're good.

22:04.968 --> 22:08.510
I told her,
I don't mind if she looks.

22:11.477 --> 22:13.614
- Who are they?
- Looters.

22:14.248 --> 22:15.484
I just met him.

22:17.483 --> 22:18.652
I used to know that guy.

22:20.751 --> 22:21.985
Went to high school together.

22:23.962 --> 22:24.988
He didn't talk too much.

22:27.229 --> 22:28.662
Much more talkative now.

22:31.735 --> 22:34.536
We've been debating
what to do with them
for two days now.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.500
We go around in circles.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.477
Tell you what.

22:43.877 --> 22:46.012
Why don't you put us
and them out of our misery

22:46.114 --> 22:47.711
and make a call?

22:47.813 --> 22:49.419
I'll put rounds
in them right now.

22:51.288 --> 22:52.983
Or beat 'em up
a little more.

22:54.993 --> 22:56.754
Strap them to the front.

22:56.856 --> 22:58.494
We'll let them go
after a couple of days.

23:06.697 --> 23:07.899
Flip the coin if you like.

23:11.042 --> 23:13.135
Would you stand with them?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.071
- Stand with them?
- Yeah.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.077
I'd like to take your picture.

23:30.289 --> 23:31.553
Okay.

23:31.655 --> 23:32.825
Stand over there?

23:33.457 --> 23:34.796
Yeah.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.631
Where do you want me?

23:37.331 --> 23:40.030
Uh, between the two.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.604
Got you.

23:47.738 --> 23:49.204
I didn't take a photo.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.212
I didn't take a single photo.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.547
I didn't even remember

23:53.649 --> 23:56.418
a camera's on me.
Like, oh, my God, like,

23:56.520 --> 23:58.815
why didn't I
just tell him not to shoot them?

23:58.917 --> 24:00.288
They're probably
gonna kill them anyway.

24:00.390 --> 24:02.256
- How do you know?
- He doesn't know,

24:02.358 --> 24:04.759
but that's besides the point.

24:04.861 --> 24:08.226
Once you start asking yourself
those questions, you can't stop.

24:08.328 --> 24:09.429
So we don't ask.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.828
We record,
so other people ask.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.102
Wanna be a journalist?
That's the job.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.970
-Hey, Lee.
- What?

24:16.072 --> 24:17.271
Back off.

24:17.374 --> 24:18.837
What am I saying
that's wrong?

24:18.939 --> 24:21.408
I'm not saying it's wrong,
she's just shook up.

24:21.510 --> 24:23.478
Lee doesn't understand
shook up.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.744
Whoa, huh?
I'm not being protective of her?

24:26.846 --> 24:29.717
You're the idiot
who let her in this car.

24:30.885 --> 24:33.551
What happened back there
is nothing in comparison

24:33.653 --> 24:35.024
to what we're heading into.

24:35.126 --> 24:36.724
You need to understand...

24:38.590 --> 24:39.958
Shit, she's crying.

24:41.630 --> 24:44.127
The back seat
is both kindergarten

24:44.795 --> 24:46.602
and an old people's home.

24:47.203 --> 24:48.399
How did this happen?

24:48.501 --> 24:50.499
Lee, what the fuck?

24:50.601 --> 24:52.003
Lee's right.

24:56.314 --> 24:57.976
I won't make
that mistake again.

25:05.749 --> 25:10.218
<i>...on
the so-called peace summit
could only be rejected,</i>

25:10.320 --> 25:13.761
<i>duly rejected by all
free thinking Americans.</i>

25:15.764 --> 25:18.898
<i>To the secessionists,
I say only this.</i>

25:20.233 --> 25:25.135
<i>I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.</i>

25:27.471 --> 25:31.312
<i>We stand ready to fulfill
the promise of our forefathers,</i>

25:31.414 --> 25:34.210
<i>to the flag, to the nation,</i>

25:36.020 --> 25:37.279
<i>and to God.</i>

25:41.323 --> 25:43.056
Stop here a minute.

25:43.925 --> 25:46.159
This feel like a good place
for a toilet break?

25:46.261 --> 25:47.322
Just pull in.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.646
Come with me.

26:08.283 --> 26:09.212
Come with me.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.150
Shoot it.

26:48.657 --> 26:50.253
- Shoot the helicopter?
- Yeah.

26:51.561 --> 26:52.827
It's gonna make
a good image.

27:21.619 --> 27:23.359
FE2s.

27:23.461 --> 27:25.191
You don't see them
around much.

27:25.293 --> 27:26.758
Yeah.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.324
They're my dad's
cameras actually.

27:30.301 --> 27:32.132
No worries,
not dead.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.500
He's...

27:33.603 --> 27:34.999
sitting on his farm in Missouri

27:35.101 --> 27:36.970
pretending like none of this
is happening.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.289
Lee,

27:55.959 --> 27:59.495
I'm sorry for jamming my way
into your ride, okay?

27:59.597 --> 28:01.058
I know
you're really angry about it,

28:01.161 --> 28:03.663
and I know you think
I don't know shit, but...

28:03.765 --> 28:06.095
I'm not angry
about that, Jesse.

28:06.197 --> 28:08.800
I don't care what you do,
or don't know.

28:08.902 --> 28:11.367
Okay, but you are
angry with me.

28:11.469 --> 28:15.305
There is no version of this
that isn't a mistake.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.275
I know, because I'm it.

28:19.009 --> 28:20.409
Joe and Sammy
are it.

28:21.682 --> 28:23.181
- It's my choice.
- Right.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.118
Then I'll remember that

28:26.220 --> 28:29.891
when you lose your shit,
or you get blown up or shot.

28:33.359 --> 28:36.326
Would you photograph
that moment if I get shot?

28:38.897 --> 28:40.033
What do you think?

28:54.619 --> 28:57.316
Every time I survived
a war zone,

28:57.618 --> 28:59.118
and got the photo,

29:00.186 --> 29:02.253
I thought I was sending
a warning home.

29:03.689 --> 29:04.893
"Don't do this."

29:06.362 --> 29:07.489
But here we are.

29:10.598 --> 29:12.065
So it's existential.

29:13.368 --> 29:14.698
What is?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.201
What's eating you.

29:20.137 --> 29:22.207
Don't worry about me, Sammy.

29:25.377 --> 29:28.543
Am I allowed to say
I remember you at her age?

29:30.718 --> 29:31.980
And I wasn't so different?

29:32.082 --> 29:33.720
You weren't so different.

29:33.822 --> 29:34.987
You think
you're being hard on her,

29:35.089 --> 29:37.321
and I think
you're being hard on yourself.

29:38.222 --> 29:40.557
- Okay, Rider.
- Damn it, Lee.

29:40.659 --> 29:42.029
Stop.

29:42.630 --> 29:43.899
I'm speaking truth.

29:44.001 --> 29:46.761
And for the record, sure,
I'm worried about that girl.

29:47.264 --> 29:49.300
And I'm worried
about you too.

29:51.434 --> 29:53.172
What are you worrying
about Lee for?

29:55.308 --> 29:58.276
Lee's lost her faith
in the power of journalism.

29:58.978 --> 30:01.517
State of the nation is QED.

30:01.619 --> 30:03.978
I can't answer
to that, Sammy.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.514
But I can tell you,

30:06.554 --> 30:08.316
this gunfire,

30:08.418 --> 30:11.190
is getting me
extremely fucking hard.

30:12.993 --> 30:15.331
Look at that shit
light up the sky.

30:15.433 --> 30:16.591
It's not our story.

30:17.267 --> 30:18.731
Yeah.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.935
But you know,
bang bang.

30:22.038 --> 30:24.335
We're not going anywhere
near that in the dark.

30:24.968 --> 30:26.172
But sunup?

30:27.944 --> 30:30.143
If they're still at it,
we'll take a look.

30:36.649 --> 30:37.920
Cool.

30:44.921 --> 30:46.126
Thanks.

31:16.756 --> 31:17.993
Action tomorrow.

31:20.498 --> 31:21.491
We're going down there?

31:21.958 --> 31:23.130
Yeah.

31:26.865 --> 31:28.102
But not you.

31:28.769 --> 31:29.933
You're gonna...

31:30.035 --> 31:31.369
You're gonna hang back.

31:33.038 --> 31:34.542
I don't wanna hang back.

31:34.644 --> 31:35.604
You have to hang back.

31:37.174 --> 31:39.377
I'm not hanging back.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.085
You should see your face.

31:45.788 --> 31:47.990
Stomach doing turns. Right.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.324
You don't get
a minute of sleep tonight.

31:53.661 --> 31:54.689
My advice,

31:55.533 --> 31:57.258
don't expect to sleep.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.567
That way if you do, it's a...

31:59.669 --> 32:01.003
It's a nice surprise.

32:05.509 --> 32:06.635
You're gonna sleep?

32:10.174 --> 32:12.014
I got a little bit Ativan.

32:15.348 --> 32:17.151
Got plenty.
I can give you some if you like.

32:17.983 --> 32:19.852
I know, it's okay.

32:19.954 --> 32:22.486
Or, I can stay up with you.

32:23.824 --> 32:24.994
Keep you company.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.657
No, I...

32:29.559 --> 32:33.134
I don't wanna be
a burden or whatever.

32:37.066 --> 32:38.238
You sure?

32:41.973 --> 32:43.342
But seriously,

32:43.444 --> 32:47.379
if you do get freaked out
or something, just wake me up.

32:48.512 --> 32:50.349
It's not nice
being scared alone.

32:54.557 --> 32:55.651
Thanks, Joe.

32:57.186 --> 32:58.390
You bet, doll.

34:05.857 --> 34:07.091
No!

34:07.193 --> 34:08.493
I said surround the building!

34:08.927 --> 34:10.495
No! Fuck!

34:13.065 --> 34:14.702
Come on!

34:18.041 --> 34:20.206
Get me the fuck
out of here!

34:20.308 --> 34:23.070
I said don't slice
the fucking building!

34:23.172 --> 34:24.446
Got it.

34:26.517 --> 34:28.084
Dude, jump in!

34:29.048 --> 34:30.417
Get ready to move.

34:30.519 --> 34:32.253
-Get the smoke.
- I gotta get the fuck
out of here!

34:36.056 --> 34:37.555
- Fuck!
- Slow down!

34:41.899 --> 34:44.633
Count of three.
Three, two, one.

34:44.735 --> 34:45.827
Count of three!

34:58.111 --> 35:00.380
Fuck!
Fuck!

35:01.114 --> 35:02.282
You all right?

35:02.384 --> 35:03.751
-I'm gonna get him!
-Forget him.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.081
- Yeah!
- Yeah, move it!

35:05.183 --> 35:06.518
You gotta move!

35:15.558 --> 35:17.430
You gotta get it right now!

35:23.135 --> 35:24.569
Move back!

35:25.070 --> 35:26.274
Move back!

35:35.184 --> 35:37.417
Got you. Hang in.
Stay over there.

35:40.990 --> 35:42.587
Fuck! Give me gauze.

37:58.696 --> 37:59.955
I need help.

39:51.668 --> 39:55.140
Holy fucking shit!

39:55.242 --> 39:56.775
What a fucking rush!

40:25.671 --> 40:27.201
- You're press?
-Yes, ma'am.

40:28.140 --> 40:29.170
IDs.

40:35.011 --> 40:37.017
Okay. Are you guys
staying the night?

40:37.119 --> 40:38.179
Yeah, just one.

40:40.451 --> 40:41.916
Park over there.

40:42.018 --> 40:43.651
There's a canteen
where you can eat.

40:43.753 --> 40:45.486
And no tents available.

40:45.588 --> 40:46.825
Thanks, ma'am.

41:11.615 --> 41:13.120
You look good.

41:13.222 --> 41:15.518
Eight, nine, ten.

41:15.620 --> 41:16.621
Hey, get in there.

41:16.723 --> 41:17.652
I'm gonna show these kids...

41:17.754 --> 41:19.955
Check this out. Okay!

41:20.058 --> 41:23.026
- Left, right.
-Here you go.

41:23.593 --> 41:24.995
Yeah.

41:25.728 --> 41:27.129
Your turn, son.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.901
Hey, wait up.

41:51.228 --> 41:52.422
Brought you something.

41:52.524 --> 41:53.793
Thanks.

41:57.695 --> 41:58.826
Don't forget to eat.

41:58.928 --> 42:00.129
Yeah, I'm starving.

42:03.966 --> 42:05.838
I'll eat once I handle this.

42:06.771 --> 42:09.510
Developing negs on the road.

42:09.612 --> 42:11.811
Yeah, I got myself
a pretty neat travel kit.

42:12.675 --> 42:14.475
I'm impressed.

42:14.577 --> 42:17.214
Want to know the secret
of getting the developer
just right?

42:17.316 --> 42:18.279
Hmm.

42:21.157 --> 42:22.486
Body temperature.

42:22.588 --> 42:24.120
- Smart.
- Thank you.

42:29.198 --> 42:34.229
So how about you tell me
the story of how you became
a photo journalist?

42:35.633 --> 42:37.372
You don't know?

42:37.474 --> 42:38.838
I thought I was
one of your heroes.

42:41.011 --> 42:43.612
Yeah, I do.

42:43.714 --> 42:46.811
When you were in college,
you took the motherfucking

42:46.913 --> 42:49.585
legendary photo
of the Antifa massacre.

42:51.118 --> 42:55.151
Then you became
the youngest ever
magnum photographer.

42:57.020 --> 42:59.754
That would be
my Wikipedia page.

42:59.856 --> 43:01.124
What's missing
from it?

43:01.824 --> 43:04.094
I don't know. A lot.

43:07.098 --> 43:08.931
Well, that's gotta
sit here for ten minutes.

43:09.033 --> 43:11.002
So you might as well
expand a little.

43:12.341 --> 43:13.807
What about your folks?

43:14.907 --> 43:17.739
Well, actually
they're on a farm too.

43:17.841 --> 43:19.876
- Oh?
- Except, Colorado.

43:19.978 --> 43:22.816
Also pretending
this isn't happening.

43:23.613 --> 43:24.785
No shit.

43:28.851 --> 43:30.285
Hey, these are dry.

43:31.019 --> 43:32.322
You should check them out.

43:32.424 --> 43:34.058
Sure.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.324
Still need a phone even though
you can't get a signal.

43:47.070 --> 43:48.569
I don't want you
to see these.

43:48.671 --> 43:50.039
Um...

43:50.142 --> 43:52.811
They're not even in focus.
Like...

43:52.914 --> 43:55.684
- Exposure is all wrong.
- Just keep looking.

43:56.984 --> 44:00.381
Figure the strike rate
for keepers is 30 to one.

44:26.647 --> 44:29.014
It's a great photo, Jessie.

46:48.792 --> 46:51.222
Did we just
drive through a time portal?

46:52.429 --> 46:53.895
It's a twilight zone.

47:23.492 --> 47:25.525
Hey there. Welcome.

47:25.627 --> 47:27.093
Feel free to look around.

47:41.441 --> 47:42.438
Hey.

47:44.314 --> 47:45.342
Out of interest,

47:47.013 --> 47:48.543
are you guys aware
there's like

47:49.917 --> 47:51.781
a pretty huge civil war
going on

47:51.883 --> 47:53.053
all across America.

47:53.851 --> 47:55.049
Oh, sure, but,

47:55.151 --> 47:57.090
we just try to stay out.

48:01.924 --> 48:03.328
Stay out?

48:03.430 --> 48:06.462
With what we see on the news,
seems like it's for the best.

48:09.536 --> 48:10.564
Yeah.

48:10.666 --> 48:12.567
Well, let me know
if you want to try anything on.

48:13.870 --> 48:15.042
Thanks.

48:16.907 --> 48:18.441
- Lee.
- Mm.

48:22.483 --> 48:23.884
What?

48:23.987 --> 48:26.284
You're so war torn,
you can't try on a dress?

48:43.438 --> 48:44.434
Jesus.

48:45.976 --> 48:47.942
When you haven't
seen yourself in the mirror...

48:48.044 --> 48:50.308
- in a few days.
- Oh, my God.
Shut the fuck up.

48:51.408 --> 48:53.245
Turn around.
I want to take your photo.

48:55.779 --> 48:56.985
No.

48:58.453 --> 48:59.449
Come on.

48:59.915 --> 49:01.121
Yes.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.132
You're gonna
take the photo?

49:18.234 --> 49:19.766
You told me not to rush.

49:19.868 --> 49:22.907
Yeah, but there's a sweet spot,
and you're missing it.

49:23.010 --> 49:24.441
No one will miss
your sweet spot.

49:26.509 --> 49:28.709
Well, no, that was
not the moment.

49:31.046 --> 49:32.319
Okay.

49:32.421 --> 49:33.516
One more.

49:39.859 --> 49:41.355
- Lee.
- Yes.

49:41.457 --> 49:43.531
You're pretty
when you smile.

49:45.996 --> 49:47.233
There you go.

49:48.405 --> 49:49.367
Hey.

49:51.871 --> 49:53.041
How about this?

49:54.708 --> 49:55.703
Yeah, nice.

49:58.011 --> 49:59.377
Not gonna
take a picture?

49:59.943 --> 50:01.478
Right.

50:01.580 --> 50:04.382
You know what, though,
running a little low on film.

50:07.116 --> 50:08.685
You're mean.

50:08.787 --> 50:10.091
I'm out.

50:15.929 --> 50:17.395
I'm gonna go try this on.

50:31.815 --> 50:33.609
You actually
bought something?

50:36.815 --> 50:38.013
She did.

50:38.115 --> 50:39.450
She's paying now.

50:43.151 --> 50:45.058
So weird.

50:45.160 --> 50:47.524
This place is like
everything I'd forgotten.

50:48.398 --> 50:49.527
Funny.

50:49.629 --> 50:52.430
I was thinking
it felt like everything
I remembered.

50:54.398 --> 50:56.236
Look at the tops
of the buildings.

50:56.803 --> 50:57.831
Be subtle.

51:13.990 --> 51:16.223
Wouldn't have suited us
anyway, Lee.

51:17.122 --> 51:18.621
We'd have gotten bored.

51:20.056 --> 51:24.023
<i>I remain ready
to accept the full...</i>

51:24.125 --> 51:28.102
<i>and unconditional surrender
of the secessionist forces.</i>

51:28.204 --> 51:32.270
<i>Deliberate the people
of the subjugated states</i>

51:32.372 --> 51:34.642
<i>and start rebuilding
our great nation.</i>

51:34.744 --> 51:36.441
Enough of this shit.

51:37.506 --> 51:39.474
Words might as well be random.

51:39.576 --> 51:40.948
What do you think
he'll actually say

51:41.050 --> 51:43.076
if I do get a microphone
over to him?

51:43.178 --> 51:44.416
Not much.

51:44.518 --> 51:49.254
The ones that get taken,
Qaddafi, Mussolini, Ceausescu.

51:49.356 --> 51:51.926
they're always lesser men
than you think.

51:52.028 --> 51:54.162
At the end,
they let you down, Joe.

51:54.264 --> 51:56.659
Just as long as he isn't dead
before I get there.

52:08.973 --> 52:10.178
Hold up.

52:39.209 --> 52:41.472
There was a turn off
three or four miles back.

52:41.574 --> 52:43.942
Maybe we should turn around,
take another route.

52:44.044 --> 52:45.478
Can you see anything?

52:45.580 --> 52:47.577
No.

52:47.679 --> 52:50.845
Nothing, no shapes,
no movement, nothing.

52:52.752 --> 52:53.749
No.

52:56.092 --> 52:58.292
Okay. I'm gonna drive forward,
I think.

53:24.919 --> 53:26.080
Should I keep going?

53:28.822 --> 53:29.888
Shit!

53:49.239 --> 53:50.509
Where you going?

53:51.141 --> 53:52.076
Sammy.

53:52.178 --> 53:53.809
Don't be
such a hotshot.

53:55.644 --> 53:57.516
Just keep
your head down.

53:57.983 --> 53:58.946
No shit.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.399
You want to try
drivin' on?

54:13.265 --> 54:14.467
This guy's a good shot.

54:43.962 --> 54:44.893
Hey.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.362
What's going on?

54:47.464 --> 54:48.798
Someone in that house,

54:51.004 --> 54:51.933
they're stuck.

54:53.270 --> 54:54.474
We're stuck.

54:55.340 --> 54:56.575
Who do you think they are?

54:57.679 --> 54:58.676
Hmm.

54:59.308 --> 55:00.546
No idea.

55:04.620 --> 55:05.683
Hey.

55:06.283 --> 55:07.454
We're press.

55:10.253 --> 55:11.425
Cool.

55:12.760 --> 55:15.858
Now I understand
why it's written
on the side of your vehicle.

55:24.867 --> 55:27.702
Are you WF?
Who's givin' you orders?

55:27.804 --> 55:30.939
No one's giving us
orders, man.

55:32.246 --> 55:33.843
Someone's trying to kill us.

55:34.511 --> 55:36.483
We're trying to kill them.

55:38.553 --> 55:40.685
You don't know
what side they're fighting for?

55:41.285 --> 55:42.720
Oh, I get it.

55:43.925 --> 55:44.887
You're retarded.

55:46.229 --> 55:48.429
You don't understand
a word I say.

55:51.194 --> 55:52.330
Yo!

55:52.432 --> 55:54.028
What's over there
in that house?

55:58.006 --> 55:58.967
Someone shooting.

56:02.844 --> 56:03.840
Guys.

56:04.375 --> 56:06.744
Shut the fuck up.

56:39.849 --> 56:40.811
I got good news.

57:17.012 --> 57:19.152
Why don't you
put your head down then?

57:19.254 --> 57:22.253
Thank you, Sammy.
I'm good.

57:22.355 --> 57:24.090
Take it from an old hand.

57:24.192 --> 57:26.055
Sleep any chance you get.

57:26.157 --> 57:28.694
You never know
what's coming
around the next corner.

57:31.560 --> 57:32.896
Yeah, all right.

58:16.241 --> 58:17.239
Sammy.

58:17.341 --> 58:18.345
What?

58:18.447 --> 58:20.680
Got a car
comin' up on us pretty fast.

58:25.483 --> 58:26.684
What do you think?

58:26.787 --> 58:29.656
I don't know.
Maybe they're just in a hurry.

58:35.596 --> 58:37.530
Oh, they're in
a hurry, all right.

58:37.632 --> 58:39.765
He smoked his tires
on the last corner.

58:41.365 --> 58:42.768
Okay.

58:42.870 --> 58:44.633
Well, we're not gonna
outrun anyone in this thing.

58:44.735 --> 58:47.039
So slow down a little, Lee.

58:47.141 --> 58:48.304
Let 'em pass.

58:48.406 --> 58:49.676
Roger that.

59:03.324 --> 59:04.691
Don't look out at 'em.

59:05.326 --> 59:07.023
They just roll on by.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.298
Oh, shit. They keep going.

59:24.310 --> 59:25.778
What the fuck?

59:26.410 --> 59:27.615
Tony?

59:28.350 --> 59:29.479
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck!

59:29.581 --> 59:31.451
How are you guys doing?

59:31.553 --> 59:33.384
You just scared
the shit out of me.

59:33.486 --> 59:35.554
Good. That was
the idea.

59:35.656 --> 59:37.425
What the fuck
are you doing here?

59:37.527 --> 59:40.221
I don't know, Joe.
What are you doing here?

59:41.394 --> 59:42.357
Fuck you!

59:42.459 --> 59:43.631
Fuck you!

59:45.629 --> 59:46.830
God, small world.

59:46.933 --> 59:49.264
Small world, my ass.
They were following us.

59:49.366 --> 59:51.806
Did you tell them
where we were headed
back in New York?

59:51.908 --> 59:53.204
Fuck no.

59:53.306 --> 59:56.971
Hey, Tony, did Joe tell you
where we were going
back in New York?

59:57.073 --> 59:59.340
I don't know, Lee.
He was pretty drunk

59:59.442 --> 01:00:02.045
when he was hitting
on that girl you got
on the back seat.

01:00:03.516 --> 01:00:04.978
- Oh...
- You're a dick.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.286
Look, I must've been
so wasted.

01:00:07.388 --> 01:00:10.150
Lee, I'm done with Bohai.

01:00:10.253 --> 01:00:12.759
He's not good company.
He drives like a maniac.

01:00:18.399 --> 01:00:19.529
Dude, what are you doing?

01:00:19.631 --> 01:00:20.827
I come over to your car.

01:00:20.929 --> 01:00:22.362
-Tony!
- Dude.

01:00:23.306 --> 01:00:24.964
Are you fucking crazy, Tony?

01:00:25.067 --> 01:00:27.039
- Dude...
- Keep the car steady.

01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:28.267
No! Fuck!

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:31.341
Don't worry.
I've done this before.

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:32.973
What the fuck!

01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:36.050
Keep the car
steady, Lee.

01:00:36.152 --> 01:00:37.311
Give me a hand.

01:00:40.048 --> 01:00:42.386
Get out of here.
Fucking mad.

01:00:42.488 --> 01:00:43.818
You're crazy.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.254
No way. That's so fucking...

01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:49.325
I gotta do it.

01:00:49.427 --> 01:00:50.426
What?

01:00:50.528 --> 01:00:51.526
I'm doing it.

01:00:51.628 --> 01:00:52.826
Jesus, Lee.

01:00:52.928 --> 01:00:54.064
Don't turn the wheel.

01:00:58.036 --> 01:01:01.535
My new passenger.
Much better, much better.

01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:02.775
Pull over.

01:01:02.877 --> 01:01:04.978
Bye bye, Tony.
Bye bye. See you in Washington.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.241
Fuck you!

01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:23.929
I told you
he drives like a maniac.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.102
Where did they go?

01:01:42.712 --> 01:01:44.582
This feel funny?

01:01:44.684 --> 01:01:46.314
Where did your guy go, Tony?

01:01:47.623 --> 01:01:49.082
He's just fucking around,
that's all.

01:01:49.184 --> 01:01:50.688
I don't want him
fuckin' around.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.587
I want Jessie
back in this car.

01:01:52.689 --> 01:01:53.692
Relax, Lee.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.060
He's just showing
how fast he can drive.

01:01:55.162 --> 01:01:57.229
- The girl's fine.
- How the fuck do you know
if she's fine?

01:01:57.331 --> 01:01:58.331
Can you see her?

01:01:58.433 --> 01:01:59.800
- Whoa!

01:02:04.272 --> 01:02:05.234
Fuck!

01:02:16.514 --> 01:02:17.851
Oh, fuck.

01:03:00.162 --> 01:03:01.125
Shit.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:36.284
We need to go down there. Now.

01:04:36.387 --> 01:04:38.453
If we go down there,
they're going to kill us.

01:04:39.194 --> 01:04:39.955
No.

01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:41.525
Those aren't government forces.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:42.660
Not up here.

01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:43.791
We got our press passes.

01:04:43.893 --> 01:04:45.230
We're cool.

01:04:45.332 --> 01:04:48.529
Those people do not want to be
seen doing what they're doing.

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:52.072
Tell us, Lee.

01:04:54.035 --> 01:04:55.170
They're talking.

01:04:55.272 --> 01:04:56.943
They're probably
just giving them a scare.

01:04:57.045 --> 01:04:58.910
They killed all the people
in that fucking truck.

01:04:59.012 --> 01:05:00.040
They could've killed
the whole town,

01:05:00.142 --> 01:05:01.143
but they will stop now?

01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:02.675
Who knows
where those bodies are from?

01:05:03.717 --> 01:05:05.249
Are the bodies in uniform?

01:05:05.915 --> 01:05:07.086
No, they're not.

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:10.590
I'm going down.

01:05:10.693 --> 01:05:12.056
- I'm coming with you.
- Me too.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.253
I'm telling you
every instinct in me says

01:05:14.355 --> 01:05:16.261
this is death, okay? Death.

01:05:16.363 --> 01:05:20.000
You stay. You stay
'cause you're old
and you can't run.

01:05:20.863 --> 01:05:22.268
Fuck it.

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:23.434
Shit.

01:05:23.537 --> 01:05:24.664
Fuck this.

01:05:28.973 --> 01:05:30.377
Just doing the talking.

01:05:30.479 --> 01:05:32.045
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:47.390
White,
there's one hung up in there.

01:05:52.896 --> 01:05:54.100
Hey!

01:05:54.766 --> 01:05:56.003
Hey, guys.

01:06:01.103 --> 01:06:02.306
What's happening?

01:06:07.214 --> 01:06:10.317
Guess there's some kind
of misunderstanding here.

01:06:10.419 --> 01:06:11.484
Yeah?

01:06:11.586 --> 01:06:12.547
Yes, sir.

01:06:13.248 --> 01:06:14.752
Those two guys over there,

01:06:14.854 --> 01:06:16.122
they're my colleagues.

01:06:22.994 --> 01:06:24.427
What kind of colleagues?

01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:27.065
Journalists, sir.

01:06:27.168 --> 01:06:29.069
We're actually just...
We're passing through.

01:06:30.738 --> 01:06:31.999
Passing through to where?

01:06:32.101 --> 01:06:33.374
Charlottsville.

01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:34.536
Charlottsville?

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.146
What's in Charlottsville?

01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:42.544
Good hiking.

01:06:43.077 --> 01:06:44.249
I hear.

01:06:48.854 --> 01:06:50.155
Actually we are...

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:53.060
No, we're covering
the university campus there.

01:06:53.795 --> 01:06:55.222
They started the new program.

01:06:55.325 --> 01:06:56.763
They are re-opening the school,

01:06:56.865 --> 01:07:00.333
which is a surreal
feel good story.

01:07:00.435 --> 01:07:01.261
Mm-hmm.

01:07:01.363 --> 01:07:03.963
And I guess we all need that.

01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:05.369
Right?

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:14.576
Yeah.

01:07:18.281 --> 01:07:19.682
This guy
is your colleague?

01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:20.886
Yeah.

01:07:20.988 --> 01:07:22.355
- This guy here?
- Yes, he's my...

01:07:24.118 --> 01:07:25.653
That guy?

01:07:38.032 --> 01:07:39.538
Sir.

01:07:41.674 --> 01:07:42.670
Just...

01:07:43.611 --> 01:07:44.573
Just what?

01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:46.878
- Just what?
- You know what?

01:07:46.981 --> 01:07:48.415
- This... Just, please.
- What?

01:07:48.517 --> 01:07:49.749
Just, please.

01:07:49.852 --> 01:07:50.782
- Sir, please.
- Please. Sure.

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:52.180
- Yes, speak.
- Let us...

01:07:52.282 --> 01:07:53.752
We're American journalists.

01:07:53.854 --> 01:07:55.081
You told me that already.

01:07:55.183 --> 01:07:56.453
Okay, we...

01:07:57.384 --> 01:07:59.122
We work for Reuters.

01:07:59.224 --> 01:08:00.760
Reuters doesn't
sound American.

01:08:00.862 --> 01:08:02.992
It's a news agency.

01:08:03.094 --> 01:08:04.056
I know
what Reuters is.

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:05.229
Sir. Okay.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.029
- I'm just saying...
- Just saying, just what?

01:08:07.131 --> 01:08:08.531
We're American, okay?

01:08:11.506 --> 01:08:12.299
Okay.

01:08:12.402 --> 01:08:14.174
What kind of American
are you?

01:08:18.606 --> 01:08:20.444
Central American,
South American?

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:29.354
What?

01:08:31.526 --> 01:08:32.687
Florida.

01:08:33.429 --> 01:08:34.425
Florida?

01:08:36.157 --> 01:08:37.362
Central?

01:08:48.043 --> 01:08:49.605
What about you?
Where are you from?

01:08:54.276 --> 01:08:55.446
Tell him, Jessie.

01:08:59.048 --> 01:09:00.353
Missouri.

01:09:00.588 --> 01:09:01.551
Missouri?

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:05.489
The "Show-Me" state, right?

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:07.728
Yes.

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:09.196
You know what they call it?

01:09:09.992 --> 01:09:11.031
Yes.

01:09:11.133 --> 01:09:12.628
Why do they call it
the "Show-Me" state?

01:09:15.362 --> 01:09:16.533
I don't know.

01:09:17.299 --> 01:09:18.469
You don't know?

01:09:23.645 --> 01:09:24.706
It's American.

01:09:25.474 --> 01:09:27.544
It is American. 100 percent.

01:09:32.384 --> 01:09:33.814
What about you?
Where are you from?

01:09:35.986 --> 01:09:36.949
Colorado.

01:09:37.889 --> 01:09:38.852
Colorado.

01:09:41.191 --> 01:09:42.724
Colorado, Missouri.

01:09:46.198 --> 01:09:47.465
That's what I'm talking about.

01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:49.434
It's American.

01:09:59.014 --> 01:10:00.577
Who is this guy
hiding over here?

01:10:01.342 --> 01:10:02.612
Hey. Buddy.

01:10:04.515 --> 01:10:06.352
What's your deal?
Where are you from?

01:10:08.886 --> 01:10:10.019
Huh?

01:10:10.121 --> 01:10:11.357
Where are you from?

01:10:13.694 --> 01:10:14.421
What?

01:10:14.524 --> 01:10:15.856
You can't speak?
Are you mute?

01:10:19.362 --> 01:10:21.367
You can't speak English?

01:10:23.137 --> 01:10:24.733
Yes, you can?
Yes, you can.

01:10:26.036 --> 01:10:26.999
Okay.

01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:33.476
You open your mouth
and tell me where you're from.

01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:35.680
Just make sure
it's clear fucking English.

01:10:35.782 --> 01:10:36.745
Okay?

01:10:39.249 --> 01:10:40.452
Where are you from?

01:10:41.419 --> 01:10:43.455
I'm from... I'm from Hong Kong.

01:10:44.726 --> 01:10:45.721
Oh, China?

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.892
China.

01:10:52.198 --> 01:10:53.163
-No!
-What?

01:10:53.265 --> 01:10:54.733
- You stop it, okay?
- Stop?

01:10:54.835 --> 01:10:55.868
No, no, no!

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:57.101
- Who the fuck...
- Stop it!

01:10:57.203 --> 01:10:58.332
Who do you think you are...

01:11:10.984 --> 01:11:12.786
Get in the car!

01:11:12.888 --> 01:11:14.585
Get in the fucking car!

01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:57.089
Go, go, go, go!

01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:58.497
Go!

01:13:00.521 --> 01:13:01.522
We gotta stop.

01:13:01.624 --> 01:13:02.960
What are you talking about?

01:13:03.062 --> 01:13:04.429
I can't drive.

01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:06.096
We can't stop.
You gotta fucking drive.

01:13:06.198 --> 01:13:07.832
- Joe.
- I can't.

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.096
He's been hit. He's bleeding.

01:13:10.764 --> 01:13:12.771
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:12.873 --> 01:13:13.968
Fuck!

01:13:16.406 --> 01:13:18.271
Fuck! Okay, get up.

01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:19.605
Get up.

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:20.947
- Let's go.

01:13:21.049 --> 01:13:22.911
Come on. Let's go, Sammy.

01:13:25.085 --> 01:13:26.178
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:46.134
Fuck!

01:17:51.385 --> 01:17:52.713
We just heard about Sammy.

01:17:52.815 --> 01:17:53.747
And the other two guys.

01:17:53.849 --> 01:17:56.689
Tony. Bohai. Their names.

01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:59.451
Lee, I'm really sorry.
I know what he was to you.

01:18:00.228 --> 01:18:01.458
It's so fucked up.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.028
Oh, it's so fucked up.

01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:05.495
It's so fucked up.

01:18:05.597 --> 01:18:08.999
Now you wait until you hear
what these two embattled
motherfuckers have to say.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.265
Joe, I'm just trying
to talk to Lee
about Sammy.

01:18:11.367 --> 01:18:14.371
I know. Yeah, I heard.
Your condolences means a lot.

01:18:14.473 --> 01:18:17.007
Now just tell her.

01:18:18.105 --> 01:18:20.309
We loved Sammy, everyone did.

01:18:21.842 --> 01:18:23.110
Thank you, Anya.

01:18:23.212 --> 01:18:26.413
Fuck. The Western Forces
are moving to D.C.

01:18:26.515 --> 01:18:30.119
Earlier today, the government,
military, basically surrendered.

01:18:33.327 --> 01:18:35.322
Yeah, that's true.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.995
This is the only protection now.

01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:40.492
Few do or die soldiers,
handful of secret service.

01:18:41.369 --> 01:18:42.929
WF's gonna roll right in.

01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:45.204
So you and I, we're too late.

01:18:45.306 --> 01:18:46.364
We missed the story.

01:18:46.466 --> 01:18:50.007
And Sammy didn't even die
for anything good.

01:19:29.878 --> 01:19:31.246
Where's Joe?

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:33.512
Processing.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.892
Me, too.

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:52.267
Hardly knew Sammy
compared to you, but...

01:19:52.934 --> 01:19:54.137
Yeah, you knew him.

01:19:55.436 --> 01:19:59.010
The man you were with,
that's who he was.

01:20:04.584 --> 01:20:06.314
It may sound fucked up,

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:09.856
but there are so many ways

01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:12.485
that it could've ended for him.

01:20:13.825 --> 01:20:15.158
And a lot of them were worse.

01:20:17.465 --> 01:20:18.898
He didn't want to quit.

01:20:24.999 --> 01:20:26.466
These last few days,

01:20:28.039 --> 01:20:30.877
I've never been scared
like that before.

01:20:32.273 --> 01:20:34.881
And I've never
felt more alive.

01:24:06.186 --> 01:24:07.357
Sniper!

01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:12.230
Man down!

01:24:24.074 --> 01:24:26.779
Move! Move, move, move!

01:24:26.881 --> 01:24:29.247
Danger detection!
Move, move, move!

01:24:56.605 --> 01:24:59.739
-Come here!
-Move, move, move!

01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:20.595
Lee?

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:23.765
Let's go!

01:26:35.342 --> 01:26:37.540
-Go, go, go!
-Come on. Come on.

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:40.312
Got him,
got him, got him.

01:26:42.511 --> 01:26:45.548
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go! Go!

01:26:49.651 --> 01:26:52.852
Get to the back!
In position now! Go! Go!

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.543
Fire!

01:27:25.357 --> 01:27:26.853
Come on, stay down.
Stay down.

01:27:31.732 --> 01:27:32.925
Walk you down.

01:27:35.367 --> 01:27:37.301
We're here to help.
What do you need?

01:27:37.404 --> 01:27:38.930
We got two over
and two on the tower.

01:27:39.032 --> 01:27:41.336
I bet we can send a round
right through that tower.

01:27:41.438 --> 01:27:43.469
Yeah, just fuckin' do it,
do it.

01:27:43.572 --> 01:27:45.910
Get back. On me.
Drop that bitch.

01:27:48.883 --> 01:27:50.514
Lee, get your head down!

01:27:51.281 --> 01:27:53.550
What tower? On whose side?

01:28:18.912 --> 01:28:20.379
Move, move, move!

01:28:24.147 --> 01:28:26.284
Move, move!

01:28:26.386 --> 01:28:29.047
Let's just go,
let's go, let's go!

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:38.759
Lee, you gotta move, okay?

01:28:38.861 --> 01:28:41.928
You have to move.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

01:28:48.539 --> 01:28:49.969
Get down,
get down, get down.

01:28:55.108 --> 01:28:57.781
They'll fall again.
Push it back, push it back.

01:28:57.883 --> 01:28:59.510
Get back!

01:28:59.612 --> 01:29:00.815
Staying clear!

01:29:05.487 --> 01:29:07.190
Move it! Move it!

01:29:07.292 --> 01:29:08.894
Fuck, Lee.
Let's move.

01:29:08.996 --> 01:29:10.462
Move, move, move.

01:29:11.028 --> 01:29:11.991
Move!

01:29:18.266 --> 01:29:20.135
Move!

01:29:20.237 --> 01:29:21.935
Get over here, now!

01:29:23.438 --> 01:29:24.938
Come here!

01:29:25.706 --> 01:29:26.907
Let's go!
Go, go, go.

01:29:28.316 --> 01:29:29.943
Move, move.
Back here, back here.

01:29:36.183 --> 01:29:39.486
Kill on the forehead!
Kill on the forehead!

01:29:39.588 --> 01:29:41.488
I don't...
Keep it going.

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:42.861
Move it. Let's go. Let's go.

01:29:42.963 --> 01:29:44.161
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:29:44.263 --> 01:29:46.932
- Go now, fast.
- Go, go, go!

01:29:47.034 --> 01:29:49.199
You're ready? On my count.

01:29:49.302 --> 01:29:52.570
Oh, my God.
So fucking close.

01:29:54.603 --> 01:29:56.607
Come on, let's go.
Again.

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:59.473
Western Forces have reached
the White House perimeter.

01:29:59.575 --> 01:30:02.010
The president is now surrounded.

01:30:02.113 --> 01:30:03.911
We have...

01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:09.752
Just give me a minute.
We're gonna have to go again.

01:30:10.452 --> 01:30:11.622
You get new shit?

01:30:12.993 --> 01:30:14.053
Lincoln Memorial.

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:15.753
You?

01:30:15.855 --> 01:30:17.658
WF rappelling out of a chopper

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.891
out on the roof
of the fucking Pentagon.

01:30:19.993 --> 01:30:21.830
There's really
only one shot go, huh?

01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:24.198
You know he's in there?

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.999
They got intel
from the generals
that surrendered yesterday.

01:30:27.101 --> 01:30:29.838
The president's right
in that fucking building.

01:30:30.943 --> 01:30:32.311
Fuck.

01:30:32.413 --> 01:30:34.480
What do you hear
they're gonna do with him?

01:30:34.848 --> 01:30:36.045
Kill.

01:30:36.147 --> 01:30:37.679
No capture.

01:30:37.782 --> 01:30:39.749
Whoever gets a fucking gun
to his head first.

01:30:41.547 --> 01:30:42.785
Hey, Lee!

01:30:44.392 --> 01:30:46.052
Don't be mean
about the money shot, huh?

01:30:51.294 --> 01:30:52.296
Got the beast.

01:30:52.398 --> 01:30:53.994
Two support men
right outside.

01:30:55.432 --> 01:30:56.997
President's on the move.

01:30:58.469 --> 01:30:59.970
Fuck yeah.
He's bustin' out.

01:31:16.486 --> 01:31:17.952
Vehicle coming through!

01:31:33.073 --> 01:31:34.606
Beast, beast, beast!

01:31:45.119 --> 01:31:46.112
I'm going to war!

01:31:58.598 --> 01:31:59.730
His vehicle
has been stopped...

01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:01.060
Go!

01:32:01.162 --> 01:32:04.031
...by Western forces
as it attempted to escape.

01:32:08.207 --> 01:32:09.641
He's not in there.

01:32:13.245 --> 01:32:14.646
He's not in there.

01:32:16.279 --> 01:32:17.242
What?

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:20.580
Okay.

01:32:20.682 --> 01:32:21.948
- Let's go.
- But...

01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.483
- Let's go, Jessie.
- What do you mean? What?

01:32:23.585 --> 01:32:24.887
Come on! Now!

01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:37.532
Follow me. Follow me.

01:32:37.634 --> 01:32:39.805
I think POTUS is movin' out.

01:32:40.207 --> 01:32:41.673
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

01:32:51.248 --> 01:32:52.211
Don't...

01:33:52.377 --> 01:33:53.778
This place is empty.

01:34:04.525 --> 01:34:06.153
Just stay the fuck
out of our way.

01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:44.861
Secret Service agent,
Joy Butler.

01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:47.898
- Drop it.
-I'm unarmed.
I'm here to talk.

01:34:48.566 --> 01:34:50.428
- Take it?
- Flood it.

01:34:59.605 --> 01:35:01.906
I'm here to negotiate
the surrender of the president.

01:35:03.282 --> 01:35:04.445
He's here.

01:35:04.547 --> 01:35:05.949
You the WF?

01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:08.853
Take a wild guess.

01:35:08.955 --> 01:35:11.920
Can the president be entrusted
into your safe care?

01:35:12.023 --> 01:35:14.622
Yes, ma'am. We'll take
real good care of him.

01:35:14.724 --> 01:35:16.059
Just bring him out here.

01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:18.027
We're not bringing him anywhere
until we have agreed terms.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.292
You need to guarantee a safe
passage for the president.

01:35:20.394 --> 01:35:23.665
And we need extraction
to a neutral territory.

01:35:23.768 --> 01:35:25.837
We request Greenland or Alaska.

01:35:26.569 --> 01:35:27.733
Nah, no terms.

01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:29.374
Bring him out here.

01:35:29.476 --> 01:35:30.740
We gotta move, sergeant.

01:35:30.842 --> 01:35:32.437
Ma'am, the President
is willing...

01:35:33.777 --> 01:35:36.177
Gunter! Poi! Jack!
Move him!

01:35:42.982 --> 01:35:44.889
Come on, get back!

01:35:51.363 --> 01:35:52.358
Just go. Go!

01:36:04.443 --> 01:36:05.404
Out! Reloading!

01:36:12.881 --> 01:36:13.846
- Get back!
- Get back!

01:36:13.948 --> 01:36:15.384
- Look out!
- I got him!

01:36:15.486 --> 01:36:16.849
Give it up!

01:36:18.589 --> 01:36:20.023
Ready to crash!

01:36:20.753 --> 01:36:21.959
Sir!

01:36:25.796 --> 01:36:28.196
I'm out. Reloading, reloading.

01:36:33.835 --> 01:36:35.038
Press back.

01:36:36.604 --> 01:36:37.669
Sir!

01:36:37.771 --> 01:36:38.943
Crash it!

01:36:42.512 --> 01:36:44.313
Go! Go!

01:36:44.415 --> 01:36:45.477
Move it.

01:36:46.913 --> 01:36:48.579
Wait! Wait!

01:36:51.291 --> 01:36:52.858
Don't move!

01:36:58.024 --> 01:36:59.560
Chief, clear way!

01:36:59.662 --> 01:37:01.291
Roger that!

01:37:01.393 --> 01:37:03.794
Fuck the cross!
Fuck the cross!

01:37:03.896 --> 01:37:05.035
Check.

01:37:05.469 --> 01:37:06.631
Forward.

01:37:06.733 --> 01:37:08.770
Cutter, I'm moving across.
I need you to lead us in fire.

01:37:08.872 --> 01:37:10.138
Charger,
you're going left.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.078
Follow me. I'm going left.
You move when I move.

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.073
Copy you!

01:37:14.175 --> 01:37:15.776
- Guys ready to move?
- Ready, ten!

01:37:15.878 --> 01:37:17.478
Move! Move back!
Move!

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:18.576
Let's go!

01:37:36.698 --> 01:37:37.936
You good?

01:37:39.537 --> 01:37:40.631
Stay down.

01:37:47.347 --> 01:37:48.512
Beacon flare!

01:37:48.614 --> 01:37:50.212
Move! You gotta move on!

01:37:50.747 --> 01:37:51.910
Move, move, go!

01:37:52.012 --> 01:37:53.413
- Move it!
- Moving.

01:37:55.519 --> 01:37:56.515
Ready.

01:37:57.691 --> 01:37:59.221
Break out, break out,
break out.

01:38:06.533 --> 01:38:08.600
Shakir! Shakir! Shakir!

01:38:08.702 --> 01:38:10.969
- I'm out. Reloading.
- Changing.

01:38:12.603 --> 01:38:13.565
Perfect crash!

01:40:02.713 --> 01:40:03.774
Wait!

01:40:05.385 --> 01:40:06.348
Wait!

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:18.228
I need a quote.

01:40:19.592 --> 01:40:22.298
Don't let... Don't let them
kill me.

01:40:25.638 --> 01:40:28.370
Yeah, that will do.
