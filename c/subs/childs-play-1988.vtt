- Yeah, the good guy doll.
- There's a peddler in the alley

11:19.667 --> 11:21.875
behind the store and I think he's got one.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.518
What? What would a peddler be doing
with a doll?

11:23.542 --> 11:26.059
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.

- 50 bucks.
- 10 and not a penny more.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.083
- 30.
- What, are you kidding?

11:56.250 --> 11:57.875
That thing is not worth 30 dollars.

11:58.042 --> 12:00.018
Hey, look. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

12:00.042 --> 12:02.122
- I'll take it.
- [Woman] Karen, it's too much money.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.143
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.018
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second, I'll take over for her.

12:51.042 --> 12:54.875
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.542
You'll just simply have to do it.

12:56.708 --> 12:59.625
Now, you can take off at five
but you'll have to be back at seven.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.417

13:10.750 --> 13:13.476
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Oh, Maggie, you can't do it again.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.375
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

Chucky is alive and
he killed Eddie caputo.

he came in when the batteries fell out.

and talking for days

47:07.042 --> 47:08.417

- How I found out the doll was alive.

to throw him into the fireplace

when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.375

ran out of the apartment.
