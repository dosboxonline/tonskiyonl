23:26.656 --> 23:27.990
Hmm.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.409
- Did you see him on the news?
- Mm-hmm.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.911
It scares me, Nancy.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.539
Maybe I shouldn't have forced them

23:35.540 --> 23:37.290
to go off together like that.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.708
The boy needs his father.

23:38.709 --> 23:42.254
Regina, you raised a good man.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.465
He'll find his way back.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.219
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.887
Look at us.
You know what we need?

23:50.888 --> 23:53.098
- We need to finish that bottle.
- Oh.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.474
- Come on.
- [laughing] Oh, no.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.643
- Refill.
- You.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.062
[Miss Nancy] Drink up.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.865

24:09.866 --> 24:13.368
Well, this is technically
our first fellas road trip.

24:13.369 --> 24:16.413
I'm not gonna have you telling people
all you had to eat was carrots.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.540
All right? [laughs]

24:18.541 --> 24:20.418
Come on.

24:23.838 --> 24:27.257
We got chocolate shake,
vanilla shake, cherry shake.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.592
Which one's mine?

24:28.593 --> 24:31.636
You mean which two are yours.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.472
- Oh...
- Ah.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.350
Don't let me catch you bragging
to Jannie about this, all right?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.436
If Nana Mama finds out,
we're both in trouble.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.397
This right here falls
under the road trip rules.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.024
Do you know what that means?

24:44.025 --> 24:45.400
No.

24:45.401 --> 24:48.112
Only the road knows.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.782
All right.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.785
Dad, can I ask you a question,
and I won't tell anybody?

24:55.786 --> 24:57.455
What's up?

24:58.539 --> 25:00.333
Why did you beat up that man?

25:03.669 --> 25:05.671
Uh...

25:06.672 --> 25:08.506
I w-I was wrong for that, D.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.134
But you had to have a good reason, right?

25:11.135 --> 25:12.844
Like, he was a terrorist or something?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.347
Uh, no.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.141
I... I thought he was bad man,

25:18.142 --> 25:21.186
uh, but he wasn't.

25:21.187 --> 25:24.272
Was just wrong place, wrong time.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.359
I was the bad man that night.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.403
Was it about Mom?

25:30.404 --> 25:32.906
[mournful music playing]

25:32.907 --> 25:35.992
Um... [clears throat]

25:35.993 --> 25:37.494
Ye-Yeah. Yeah.

25:37.495 --> 25:40.413
Uh, you know what?

25:40.414 --> 25:42.707
I-I thought if I could

25:42.708 --> 25:44.626
find the answers I was looking for,

25:44.627 --> 25:46.212
that I-I could, uh...

25:47.380 --> 25:49.089
I-I.. I didn't.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.841
You know, that-that part doesn't matter.
Just--

25:51.842 --> 25:53.134
- Why can't we talk about it?
- You just

25:53.135 --> 25:54.511
need to know it was wrong, okay?

25:54.512 --> 25:56.805
- Just finish your burger.
- I was just trying--

25:56.806 --> 25:58.683
Just leave it, D.
Damn!

26:04.397 --> 26:06.147
[car door opens]

26:06.148 --> 26:07.399
Fuck.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.151
[car door closes]

26:11.696 --> 26:13.196
[Daine] <i>Once we have</i>

26:13.197 --> 26:17.158
straight edges, minimizing swelling
becomes our top priority.

26:17.159 --> 26:20.245
Under normal circumstances,
we would embrace swelling

26:20.246 --> 26:22.580
as part of the natural healing process,

26:22.581 --> 26:23.832
<i>but in this case</i>

26:23.833 --> 26:25.125
we don't have two days,

26:25.126 --> 26:27.794
much less two weeks
to allow for that process.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.462
We must remove tissue.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.923
<i>If we were working with a thigh or a back,</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:33.341
breast or belly,

26:33.342 --> 26:36.511
removing adipose tissue
might be sufficient.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.721
<i>But the musculature</i>

26:37.722 --> 26:40.223
of the face is so prominent

26:40.224 --> 26:42.434
that excising fat is not enough

26:42.435 --> 26:43.935
to restore symmetry.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.272
Now we turn our attention
to our biggest enemy:

26:47.273 --> 26:48.940
lymphatic fluid.

26:48.941 --> 26:53.236
The solution to fluid retention
is a very small shunt

26:53.237 --> 26:55.530
<i>placed just above the gumline.</i>

26:55.531 --> 26:57.490
Like drip irrigation.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.493
Our final procedure--
and one very few can do well--

27:00.494 --> 27:01.911
is subcutaneous stitching.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.538
<i>Ninety percent</i>

27:03.539 --> 27:05.874
of the suture exists under the skin.

27:05.875 --> 27:09.294

27:10.546 --> 27:12.130
<i>Even after all that,</i>

27:12.131 --> 27:14.632

27:21.390 --> 27:24.017
But there is a type of mastic,

27:24.018 --> 27:27.354
commonly referred to as mortician's putty.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.189
<i>And when applied correctly,</i>

27:29.190 --> 27:31.358
it seamlessly smooth over

27:31.359 --> 27:34.737
the ridges and fill the tiny crevices...

27:35.905 --> 27:37.490
...that only a camera would see.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.494
So, you see, in the right hands,
with the right lighting,

27:42.495 --> 27:44.246
anything's possible.

- Yeah.

28:13.609 --> 28:14.859
I'm Susan Kowaleski.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.945
I work with Alex. Is he here?

28:16.946 --> 28:18.363
I'm afraid not.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.281
Did you say Kowaleski?

28:20.282 --> 28:22.117
I-Is this about the Nolan case?

28:22.118 --> 28:23.952
Oh...

28:23.953 --> 28:25.453
I already know about Deirdre.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.914
I'm sorry, I really need
to speak with Alex.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.333
You do understand that I live
in this house, too, don't you?

28:30.334 --> 28:33.044
Along with Alex and his two children.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.589
All of whom I've raised,
all of who are suffering for,

28:36.590 --> 28:39.175
well, whatever's going on
with this Nolan girl.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.428
Look, I don't mean to be rude,

28:41.429 --> 28:43.972
but my grandson is under a lot of stress,

28:43.973 --> 28:46.224
and I-I think I have a right to know

28:46.225 --> 28:48.977
who's coming after us. Don't you?

28:48.978 --> 28:51.521
Alex told me you used to be a teacher.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.231
Nobody got away with anything, did they?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.524
[scoffs]

28:54.525 --> 28:55.775
Not in my classroom, they didn't.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.403
There's a ramp on the side of the house.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.739
Come on in and let me fix something for us

29:01.740 --> 29:04.701
while you walk me through the case.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.327

- I can put on my headphones.
- No, D.

No, you don’t have to...

30:18.484 --> 30:20.693
I'd like to ask you a few questions about

30:20.694 --> 30:22.320
somebody I think you know.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.696
His name's Ed Ramsey.

- Well, if you don’t

Eddie came to all our shows.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.064
I've seen videos of your performances.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.483
It's very dark stuff.

Ramsey-- he was a fan?

31:02.361 --> 31:04.445
[scoffs]

31:04.446 --> 31:07.073
Eddie didn't give a shit about the music.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.200
He loved what I sang about.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.828
Death. Murder.

31:11.829 --> 31:15.666
All that bullshit that I thought
was so cool back then.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.962
- I'm a different guy now.
- Hmm.

31:20.963 --> 31:24.757
We spoke to a childhood friend
of Ramsey's.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.718
Said he made him dig up a knife,

31:26.719 --> 31:29.847
send it to a guy in Philadelphia.

31:45.279 --> 31:46.697
I was like him.

But I was just singing, man.

- but for Eddie--
- The knife. Do you still have it?

32:02.838 --> 32:05.798

Why?

- Fuck no.
- Then why have you

been sitting on it this whole time?

35:23.288 --> 35:24.789
- [White Mike] Sorry, dude!
- Don't be sorry.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.541
This is what you want, Mike. Finish it.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.252
What? No!

35:29.336 --> 35:31.087
Uh, fine, fine.
Uh, let me just get the shot

35:31.088 --> 35:33.089
of you holding it up over his heart, okay?

35:33.090 --> 35:34.173
Fuck that! Let me up!

35:34.174 --> 35:35.424
Listen, you're already cut, dude.

35:35.425 --> 35:36.969
Relax.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.887
It's one more picture, Mike.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.055
It's gnarly.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.306
Come on.

[choking]

36:05.455 --> 36:07.290
You fucking killed him.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.542
No.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.546
- [shuddering, whimpering]
- We killed him.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.599
I know you didn't kill him.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.726
But you also didn't say anything.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.269
I wanted to.

36:28.270 --> 36:31.314
Did it ever occur to you
that he might not stop?

36:31.315 --> 36:33.441
[crying]

36:33.442 --> 36:34.942
He has someone now.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.193
We can stop him.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.029
We can save her.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.532
But we're gonna need your help.

- And one more thing.
- Yeah.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.626
That tape is in bad shape.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.503
John needs to get it digitized
immediately.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.756
That's a long list of things
you want me to remember.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.549
Wouldn't it be better
if you just told him yourself?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.052
I don't think he really wants
to hear from me right now.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.137
Why don't you fix it?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.474
I'm tired of this proxy shit.

- Yeah.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.583
Came and invited me to join.

Of who?

38:37.983 --> 38:40.360
Deirdre Nolan's accomplice.

38:41.445 --> 38:43.405
Uh, what's this about, honey?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.240
It's nothing.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.658
Go in the other room.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.201
[Tippy] Well, if it's nothing,

38:49.202 --> 38:51.370
I don't need to go anywhere, do I?

38:51.371 --> 38:54.290
He just doesn't want you to know
that he messed up.

38:54.291 --> 38:58.419
A prosecutor slipped
one of his case files to me.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.545
They're not supposed to do that.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.339
A young lady named Deirdre Nolan

39:02.340 --> 39:04.008
confessed to murder.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.634
Two witnesses said she had an accomplice.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.762
Even gave a name.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.346
But your husband

39:09.347 --> 39:12.349
buried their statements

39:12.350 --> 39:13.768
and the name.

39:13.769 --> 39:15.436
So...

39:15.437 --> 39:17.855
the accomplice is still out there.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.775
Is that true, Roger?

39:20.817 --> 39:22.651
The girl confessed.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.612
Said she acted alone.

39:24.613 --> 39:27.073
She did not.

39:27.074 --> 39:28.699
And you know that.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.659
You took the easy win

39:30.660 --> 39:32.995
and now you're retired.
Now you're fishing.

is not coming to haunt you,

- [Anderson] No.

40:05.904 --> 40:06.862
Not yet.

40:06.863 --> 40:07.988
[Sampson] You're joking.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.073
We got more than enough.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.033
- So does he.
- What does that mean?

40:11.034 --> 40:14.036
Ramsey's got enough to go scorched-earth
on this entire department

40:14.037 --> 40:16.163
if we don't handle this perfectly.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.250
No. No one touches him
until we get an indictment.

40:19.251 --> 40:22.545
You can't expect us
to pull a grand jury at this hour.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.004
I already made the call.

It's the right move, John.

Don't beat yourself up.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.892
You're doing the right thing.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.977
Okay, so you're saying you have clearance

41:19.978 --> 41:22.354

to the actual Senate floor?

Hell yeah. If you ever want to see it,
I'm your guy.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.277
Wouldn't that get you in trouble, though?

41:28.278 --> 41:30.029

But you don't know nothing about that.
You're too young.
