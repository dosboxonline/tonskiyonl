-Good luck.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.923
We got one shot of this.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.802
If anybody fucked up and those stones
aren't there, it ain't my problem.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.306
-The stones are there.
-Not for long. Later.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.759

05:40.298 --> 05:41.966
Thanks.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.788
Where are the stones?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.541
Who the fuck are you?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.303
Who's getting them for you?

06:28.305 --> 06:29.388
Back off!

06:33.852 --> 06:35.644
I want a name and a number.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.481
Okay.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.483
-Okay, I'll tell you.
-I know.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.986
I hate these things.
Don't you hate these things?

06:44.988 --> 06:46.614
-Just doing my job.
-Oh.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.159
Then again, you never know
who you're gonna meet, right?

06:54.581 --> 06:58.459
I bet you're a lot more fun
than any of those boring people upstairs.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.504
Really, ma'am, l have a job to do.

07:05.634 --> 07:09.762
Right, well, l suppose l should
go see what they're selling.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.102
Tommy.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.938
Change of plans, he's gay. You're up.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.023
-No way.
-Yes, way.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.233
Come on, man!

07:22.400 --> 07:25.111
-All right, Tommy, your turn.
-Hell, no!

07:25.278 --> 07:28.739
This is not a conversation.
Do it! And make it good.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.366
Shit.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.867
Keycard.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.371
So why don't you hold onto my purse.
I shouldn't be too long.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.299
Aloha.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.717
Hi.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.305
I hope you don't take
offense to this...

07:53.640 --> 07:56.308
...but l have such a weakness
for a man in uniform.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.062
-If that's your thing.
-Uniforms are my thing.

08:00.730 --> 08:05.651
I mean, every time l see a sailor,
all l can think about is hmm ... seafood.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.320
I'm actually not supposed to
be talking on duty.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.780
Who's talking?

08:10.282 --> 08:11.907
Baby, this is flirting.

08:14.494 --> 08:19.123
Unless you're one of those big handsome
men letting it go to waste on a woman.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.333
The world is full of fools.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.795
Yahtzee!

08:27.299 --> 08:30.342
-What's it looking like?
-About a six-second rotation.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.015
Tommy.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.352
But you can call me Rachel.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.520
-Douglas.
-Oh.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.570
I just hope l'm not too...

08:49.738 --> 08:50.779
...pretty for you.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.699
-I'm hooked up.
-That bitch.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.791
I like sunsets, puppy dogs....

09:04.294 --> 09:05.628
I'm big in the pants.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.797
I can almost tie it in a knot.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.302
Let's get the table.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.268
Guess one day l'll have to come in here and do
a little shoplifting and let you catch me.

09:21.436 --> 09:25.648
Resist arrest just so you can
wrestle me down...

09:26.775 --> 09:27.816
...and cuff me.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.653
I can be pretty rough.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.989
Don't get me excited now.

10:31.423 --> 10:35.342
Fait.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.768
Holy shit!

10:45.979 --> 10:47.396
Earthquake.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.900
But l bet you can hit a 10
on the Richter scale anytime, Douglas.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.706
Let's do it.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.176
All right. Y'all know what to do.
Let's get it on.

11:43.286 --> 11:47.831
-911, what's your emergency?
-I want to report a robbery in progress.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.209
Robbery in progress.
What's the location?

12:12.941 --> 12:16.193
Man, l love cut stones.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.489
This one blue diamond
is at least two and a half million dollars.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.699
Oh, yeah? So whose stuff we stealing anyway mah?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.494
-Drug dealers, money launderers....
-Works for me.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.038
This....

12:29.833 --> 12:31.083
This I can use.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.172
T.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.216
Check this out.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.845
-This is what we came for.
-Oh.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.597
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.891
Jackpot. The rest is ours.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.021
Yeah.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.692
Your employer betrayed you.
The police are on the way.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.069
-Leave the stones.
-Who is this?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.613
You know the ones l mean.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.283
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.077
Wrap them up.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.886
Let's go, boys.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.638
Better go move my car.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.390
Five-O at the door, gotta go.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.602
-Move now!
-Time to bounce. Leave this shit.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.982
-Is this your car?
-Yeah, it's my car!

13:37.150 --> 13:39.109
-Get it out of here!
-Move your shit--

13:39.277 --> 13:41.570
-I'll move that, you move this.
-All right.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.156
Let's go. Out of here, right now.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.592
They stopped the trains.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.428
We don't have a lot of time.
Daria comes with me.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.890
I can't tell you how to get there,
but you know where to be.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.185
-Faith.
-Faith.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.131
It's clear.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.649
Hold it.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.288
All clear.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.958
Okay.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.693
Nice.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.865
-Train is secure.
-Ok. Get this train out of here.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.158
You got it.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.801
The stones?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.650
Watch out!

16:26.235 --> 16:27.736
The bag!

17:53.698 --> 17:54.740
Fuck.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.493
Enjoying California?

18:39.660 --> 18:42.829
Hope we're not here long.
I hate sunshine.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.375
We may have a problem.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.878
The stones?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.380
The Exchange was just robbed.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.383
Let's hope that was part of the plan.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.917
Who's in charge?

19:29.627 --> 19:30.752
Who wants to know?

19:38.261 --> 19:39.761
Follow me.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.938
Vanessa. What are you still doing up?

19:50.106 --> 19:53.316
-Just a little longer?
-Just a little longer?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.610
Come on sweetheart, you have school tomorrow.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.946
Come on. Time for bed.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.784
-Getting heavy!
-No, I'm not.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.206
Wait a minute.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.792
There's something behind your ear.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.461
Please. That is so lame.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.881
-What you mean?
-It's in your hand.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.468
This hand? Or this hand?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.014
Watch.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.358
-How'd you do that?
-Magic.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.737
-Is it for me?
-Of course it's for you.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.407
A diamond for my princess.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.037
It's beautiful.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.748
-So are you.
-I love you, Daddy.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.541
I love you too.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.918
Let's say our prayers.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.925
Angels east, angels west,
north and south, just do your best...

21:00.092 --> 21:02.510
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.970
-Amen.
-Amen.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.806
-Give me some love.
-Okay.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.228
Can l have another one?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.607
Yeah, you can have another one.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.694
Vanessa's in the bed now.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.531
-She's asleep for the rest of the night.
-She won't listen to me.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.242
I'll talk to her. Go to sleep anytime.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.287
-I'm watching TV if you need me.
-All right. Thank you.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.540
Player, what the hell happened?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.810
Should we be considering
a long vacation...

21:51.978 --> 21:54.354
...in a warm foreign climate
with no extradition?

21:54.522 --> 21:58.316
The cat that called was only interested
in the black stones.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.695
-Christophe sold us out.
-Or something.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.242
-Oh, God, you made it.
-By the skin of my black ass.

22:07.410 --> 22:12.288
Man, some Chinese dude kicked my ass
all around that goddamn train track.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.916
Asshole busted my earpiece too.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.461
-The worst part, he snagged the loot.
-Shit!

22:19.964 --> 22:22.632
So, maybe it's time to rethink
this no-gun policy shit.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.592
A little ass-whupping ain't shit.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.096
At least you didn't have to play
all foxy with the rent-a-cop!

22:30.016 --> 22:32.934
-This all we got.
-So, what do we do now?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.107
-Wait to hear from me.
-So where are you going?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.776
I'm gonna get some answers.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.699
-Hold up, dog. I got your back.
-I got this one.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.577
But if I need you, l'll call you.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.121
-All right.
-All right?

22:54.749 --> 22:56.541
Be careful.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.139
So this is Mr. Christophe.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.017
Apparently we're not
his first visitors today.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.936
Please, Señor Ling, have mercy.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.315
Whatever you're going to say,
make it the truth.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.152
You may not have another opportunity.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.155
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.162
Bang!

23:34.330 --> 23:35.705
You like it?

23:36.999 --> 23:41.044
-It's all right.
-Oh. Think about it.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.380
Hey you want it? I'll make you
a deal on it, ammo included.

23:44.548 --> 23:49.886
It's got reactive armor, Browning
.50-caliber, 7.62 M-60 machine gun.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.971
And that cannon there, that's 90 mm.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.642
Good around the bad areas of town.
Keeps neighborhood kids in line.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.227
-I'll pass.
-How about this?

23:57.394 --> 24:00.730
-A Marine Corps Assault Hovercraft?
-Actually, I'm here on other business.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.483
Hey, Arch! We're out of room
in the storage.

24:03.651 --> 24:07.195
All right, listen put them in my office
and be careful, they're expensive.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.863
Well, not expensive to me.

24:09.031 --> 24:12.700
Hey, listen ah, you weren't by any chance
downtown today, were you, Tony?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.369
Not at all.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.372
I didn't think so.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.876
-Ever see a black diamond?
-I've seen a white diamond, pink...

24:22.044 --> 24:25.463
...yellow, blue ones. I've seen Neil
Diamond. He is awesome in concert.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.090
He's in town in two weeks--

24:33.889 --> 24:35.723
Never seen a black diamond.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.561
Not like this.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.400
-Wow. You got me.
-Find out what they're worth.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.861
-Is there a timetable on this?
-Yesterday.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.155
-That's what I figured.
-I'll be back.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.241
Gonna return a favor to a friend.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.995
Looks dead to me.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.667
-Guess you got to him first.
-Not me, not my style.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.045
You're the one that called me.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.007
The same one that bumped into Miles.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.344
Who the fuck are you?

25:54.511 --> 25:57.472
-My name is Su.
-All right, Su, l'm Sally.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.308
-I want the black stones.
-Make me an offer.

26:02.311 --> 26:06.189
-You can walk out of here alive.
-No deal.

26:16.450 --> 26:17.825
Leave a message.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.162
Mr. Fait, I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.583
We need to talk, now.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.003
Who the fuck is this?

26:29.171 --> 26:32.507
The man for whom Mr Christophe arranged
to have the black stones...

26:32.675 --> 26:36.177
...brought into the country
and deposited at the Jewelry Exchange.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.887
The man who wants them back.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.723
-Now.
-All right, well, how much?

26:41.517 --> 26:45.019
Maybe you didn't understand me.
The stones are already mine.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.229
Yo, check this out?

26:46.397 --> 26:49.357
I got them, I'm selling them,
put the money on the wood!

26:49.900 --> 26:51.442
I don't have time for this.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.569
That's your last offer?

26:53.904 --> 26:56.030
I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.702
I don't get it. Do I look like
the Salvation Army?

27:00.869 --> 27:04.789
I bust my ass all night and got nothing
to show for it. You know what, dog?

27:04.957 --> 27:07.333
It don't even matter
who the fuck you are.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.544
I ain't got nothing for you.

27:55.924 --> 28:16.277
Shit!

29:07.121 --> 29:08.162
Give us the stones.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.040
How many times l got to tell you people?

29:11.208 --> 29:14.836
I'm a businessman.
Make me a fucking offer!

29:16.171 --> 29:18.005
Here's your offer.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.968
That shit ain't gonna work, homes,
because l don't have the stones!

29:22.136 --> 29:23.428
Tell us where they are.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.025
Come on!

31:05.781 --> 31:06.822
The car!

31:19.628 --> 31:21.671
What is it with these fucking stones?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.218
-Yeah.
-It's Archie.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.762
Bad news. We got a problem.

31:30.097 --> 31:33.933
I put word out on the street
to get some info on the stones.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.936
Next thing I know,
the Wu-Tang Clan shows up here.

31:37.104 --> 31:38.729
Three important elements here.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.106
One, I'm outmanned...

31:40.274 --> 31:43.818
...two, they're heavily armed,
and three, they're about to pound me.

31:43.986 --> 31:47.655
-I can't watch anymore. l got a few--
-Let's see the rest.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.324
Did you see my new DVD players?

31:50.492 --> 31:51.534
All right! Okay!

31:51.994 --> 31:54.245
-Give me that!
-I forgot I had them!

31:54.413 --> 31:59.083
I could've resisted more. They could've
beat me into a coma or killed me.

31:59.251 --> 32:03.170
How could I tell you where the stones
are if l'm dead or on life support?

32:03.338 --> 32:06.048
So I threw in the towel,
reluctantly, for your sake.

32:06.216 --> 32:09.010
-So you saved yourself to tell me.
-Right.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.012
-So tell me.
-What?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.514
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.017
-What did they say?
-Well, they said:

32:16.184 --> 32:19.270
"Give me the stones,
you fat cracker motherfucker."

32:19.438 --> 32:21.355
-That sort of thing.
-That's it?

32:21.523 --> 32:24.900
That's pretty bad.
Cracker is kind of racist.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.487
Thanks for keeping yourself alive
long enough to tell me nothing!

32:28.655 --> 32:31.407
-Did you call the police?
-Did l call the police?

32:31.575 --> 32:33.576
Look around here, are you crazy?

32:33.744 --> 32:36.704
Only question now is,
who's behind this jack move?

32:36.872 --> 32:41.626
I don't know, but they got great guns
I can't get. U.S. Special Forces only.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.837
-Chambers.
-Jump Chambers?

32:45.005 --> 32:46.464
I hope not.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.469
Hey, who's Jump Chambers?

32:51.637 --> 32:54.305
This guy's in on everything
that goes down in town.

32:54.473 --> 32:58.351
The only one I know that can get those
weapons. And he has a fucking army.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.062
You're on your own,
I don't need the headache.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.065
And since l'm totally fucked,
who are you?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.400
Yeah, you got an lD?

33:06.568 --> 33:09.111
Buddy? Picture, preferably?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.405
Yeah, all right.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.243
-This means nothing to me.
-Let me see it.

33:17.621 --> 33:21.165
It's Taiwan, Central Security Bureau.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.668
-Taiwanese Intelligence.
-Read Chinese?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.836
No, but l know "cop"
in every language.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.297
What are you?
Some kind of kung fu James Bond?

33:28.465 --> 33:31.676
-The stones belong to Taiwan.
-They belong to Chambers now.

33:33.095 --> 33:36.347
-I'm starting to hate this fucking phone.
-I'll get you a new one.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.433
-Yeah.
-I hope you've reconsidered.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.977
Oh, it's bad-ass! What's up, homes?

33:42.771 --> 33:45.940
You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.
Let me make it easy.

33:46.108 --> 33:48.943
I can't wait to hear this.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.113
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

33:55.367 --> 33:58.786
She's very pretty in her pink pajamas,
aren't you, Vanessa?

33:58.954 --> 34:01.706
-Son of a--
-I want my stones, Mr. Fait.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.208
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.335
Don't you fucking touch her!

34:06.503 --> 34:08.879
The Chinese gentleman, please.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.304
He has my daughter.
He wants to talk to you.

34:19.808 --> 34:20.850
Jesus, Tony.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.998
What happened? What did you just do?

34:45.167 --> 34:48.668
I said l have the stones,
and I won't negotiate for your daughter.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.004
-What?
-That's stupid.

34:50.172 --> 34:53.047
It will confuse him,
buy us time, keep her alive.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.719
What the hell are you talking about?
This motherfucker has my baby!

34:56.887 --> 34:59.263
Look, l know him.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.851
I want the stones, you want your
daughter. We can help each other.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.530
So I'm stuck with you.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.708
Get in.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.886
We gotta see Chambers.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.621
Find a place to put her.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.584
My daddy's gonna come
and kick your butts!

36:15.549 --> 36:17.675
Su says he has the stones.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.763
But why cut me off?
Why not negotiate for the girl?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.391
Doesn't make any sense.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.853
Buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should we stop them?

36:29.229 --> 36:31.480
We'll never regain their confidence.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.776
We need information. Find
the right people, pay whatever it costs.

36:37.404 --> 36:41.574
Something's not right.
Something's happening with the stones.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.868
What about the girl?

36:44.578 --> 36:47.454
We'll need her. She stays alive...

36:47.622 --> 36:49.164
...for now.

36:51.501 --> 36:55.170
I'm on my way to see Chambers
now. No, l don't have a choice.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.632
Get in touch with his people,
let him know l need to see him.

36:58.925 --> 36:59.967
I'll call you back.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.306
I'm sorry about your daughter.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.477
-How old is she?
-Mind your business.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.238
She's 8. She'll be 9 in September.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.158
Mine is 15.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.828
-Boyfriends?
-Never. I'd kill them.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.830
You wish.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.503
-About time you PMD.
-PMD?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.547
Yeah, Put Me down.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.674
What's this all about?

37:41.635 --> 37:45.596
-The stones are not what you think.
-No shit.

37:46.681 --> 37:51.185
-What about this guy who has Vanessa?
-He's exactly what you think he is.

37:51.811 --> 37:54.313
A thief and a killer.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.443
Great.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.862
Fucking great.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.534
I want my daddy!

38:07.994 --> 38:09.036
Keys.

38:11.665 --> 38:13.540
Where'd you get this piece of shit?

38:13.708 --> 38:18.379
Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
have a long walk from the campground.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.465
-You sure you cleaned it out?
-Ohh it's clean, all right.

38:21.675 --> 38:24.510
I want my daddy! l want my daddy!

38:25.220 --> 38:27.471
-Shut up!
-You shut up!

38:28.348 --> 38:29.890
Go to sleep!

38:49.411 --> 38:53.122
Angels east, angels west...

38:53.289 --> 38:56.083
...north and south, just do your best...

38:56.584 --> 38:59.420
...to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.755
Amen.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.368
Who rang that bell?

39:33.538 --> 39:38.459
Here are your visitors, Mr. Chambers.
And the morning mail.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.007
Hey, yo, Vogel.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.843
My DVD's broke.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.429
Get you a new one straight away,
Mr. Chambers.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.848
Well, well, well. Tony Fait.

39:53.016 --> 39:57.352
Come all this way to visit his
old pal Jump. Who's the gook?

39:57.979 --> 40:00.564
-Chinese guy.
-Hmm.

40:02.567 --> 40:03.817
Hey.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.780
No shoes in my crib, man.

40:22.921 --> 40:27.966
-How you doing, Jump?
-Don't waste my fucking time, nigga.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.720
-Look, l got a problem.
-How's Daria?

40:32.347 --> 40:35.390
-Good.
-Yeah, she always was good.

40:35.558 --> 40:40.521
From the moment l saw her to the
moment you took her away from me.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.358
-Problem?
-The black stones.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.860
That bitch brought in too.

40:47.028 --> 40:51.073
I made a lot of money with her, but
that's all stopped. You stopped that.

40:51.241 --> 40:54.118
You decided it was okay
to put an end to that.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.579
-Black stones, what?
-I need them back.

40:57.747 --> 41:01.291
The only smart thing you did
was not pimping her yourself.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.546
See, because then I'd have been real
heated and you'd have been real dead.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.506
But you don't pimp, right?

41:07.674 --> 41:12.302
You're just a thief in the night,
stealing shit that don't belong to you.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.972
Hey.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.481
-What? He don't talk?
-I don't speak Korean.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.736
Yeah, well, l do.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.656
Bought me a little Korean
spot downtown.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.659
Bringing in the soul brothers
24-7, 365.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.620
Black man gouging Koreans.
Ain't that a switch, Chick?

41:40.915 --> 41:46.461
Them motherfuckers got faces like walls,
but love to drink and look at naked girls.

41:46.629 --> 41:49.506
Place ain't no shitbox.
You should see my office.

41:49.674 --> 41:53.427
Got that shit decked out
like a kabuki love palace.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.929
You know what that is, right?

41:56.514 --> 41:59.933
Why don't you roll by sometime?
Check out the poon.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.228
My little girl is mixed up in this.

42:05.273 --> 42:08.192
If I don't get those stones back,
she's dead.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.573
What do you want, man? I mean--

42:18.786 --> 42:22.623
-I'm begging.
-You know, I was thinking.

42:23.625 --> 42:27.961
That was a big heist. Risky heist.

42:28.630 --> 42:34.843
What would make a man go through that
kind of trouble, take that kind of heat?

42:38.056 --> 42:40.140
Gotta be something good.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.645
Something valuable.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.691
Jump...

42:50.777 --> 42:53.153
...it's my little girl.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.656
Make another one.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.991
You mother--

42:58.326 --> 42:59.993
Drama.

43:00.870 --> 43:03.080
I see the slope's no dope.

43:05.166 --> 43:08.585
Got a lot of offspring running
around, brother.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.837
Big score is once in a lifetime.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.507
-Yo, let me at him.
-Go ahead. Shit.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.018
Say hey to Daria for me.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.730
Don't forget your fucking shoes.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.362
Pussy.

43:39.033 --> 43:43.912
I used to really look up to that guy.
Used to want to be just like him.

43:44.080 --> 43:49.209
-In Taiwan, l can make him talk.
-Yeah, well, this ain't Taiwan.

43:49.419 --> 43:53.547
Only thing we can do now is try to find
out where the stones are and get them.

43:53.715 --> 43:56.925
-You make it sound easy.
-It won't be.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.477
-What?
-They're at his club.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.813
How do you know?

44:09.981 --> 44:13.859
I know. I can just feel it.
It's never happened to you?

44:14.027 --> 44:15.569
No.

44:15.737 --> 44:22.117
-Thought you Chinese were all mystical.
-We like to gamble. Not guess.

44:22.744 --> 44:28.749
It's no guess, but I could be wrong.
I'll hit the club, you go see Archie.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.209
Why?

44:31.961 --> 44:35.756
-He has to remember something.
-What if he can't?

44:35.923 --> 44:38.925
Pretend it's Taiwan.
Make him remember.

44:46.934 --> 44:50.270
Hey. Get away from here.
What are you doing?

44:50.438 --> 44:53.190
Relax. l'm just seeing if I can
help with something.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.777
Well, you can't. It's very delicate
equipment, so just stay away.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.988
All right? Stay away from the truck.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.450
-What?
-Stay away from my fucking truck!

45:03.618 --> 45:05.786
Okay, stop it.

45:07.622 --> 45:11.458
Backing away.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.711
Someone give the geek his Ritalin.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.463
At least he's doing his job...

45:16.631 --> 45:20.509
...which is more than l can say for
some people. Tape her up and gag her.

45:20.676 --> 45:22.761
I want my daddy! l want my daddy!

45:22.929 --> 45:27.808
I want my daddy! l want my daddy!

45:27.975 --> 45:30.352
-I want my daddy!
-Let go of me!

45:30.520 --> 45:32.312
-Shut up!
-I want my daddy!

45:32.480 --> 45:34.481
-I want my daddy!
-Waste of time.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.858
I can think of a way of shutting you up.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.655
Yes!

45:41.989 --> 45:44.533
Shit! She's got the key!

46:25.908 --> 46:27.367
Hey, how are you doing?

46:39.464 --> 46:41.256
-Precious Daria.
-What's up?

46:41.424 --> 46:43.216
Long time, no see.

46:43.384 --> 46:47.387
-So, what brings you around here?
-Sometimes you need to see old friends.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.474
-What? You got trouble?
-With a capital T.

46:51.142 --> 46:55.061
Tony Fait? Thought you two
were tight. Bonnie and Clyde.

46:56.147 --> 46:58.106
Yeah, it used to be that way.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.233
Not taking care of me these days.

47:01.319 --> 47:04.654
Kid's all he cares about.
It's a shame, huh?

47:04.822 --> 47:08.658
-So, what you want me to do?
-I don't know.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.745
Probably nothing you can do.
I just thought...

47:11.913 --> 47:13.288
...you know.

47:15.416 --> 47:19.961
This is crazy. I don't even know what l
was thinking. l shouldn't be in here.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.756
No, hold up, hold up. Girls.

47:22.924 --> 47:27.511
-Give us a minute. Champagne?
-Yes.

47:31.265 --> 47:32.807
I got it.

47:33.559 --> 47:37.979
-So you looking for a job?
-I need something.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.191
How about you work here?

47:42.151 --> 47:45.779
How would Jump feel about me
coming back and all?

47:45.947 --> 47:49.199
You let me worry about Jump Chambers.
In the meantime...

47:50.117 --> 47:54.204
...how about we go to my office
and we talk about this a little bit more?

47:55.957 --> 47:59.292
It's not exactly boxing matches,
it's a lot more dangerous.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.628
No gloves or nothing, no rules, period.

48:01.796 --> 48:06.132
It's huge money. It's very illegal.
They hold it during the day to fool cops.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.469
The man you remember,
how do you know he'll be here?

48:09.637 --> 48:13.640
I don't, but this is Chambers' operation,
so it's a damn good place to start.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.725
Here we are.

48:17.728 --> 48:21.022
-This is a private club.
-It's me, Archie.

48:21.190 --> 48:25.110
-Everybody likes me here.
-It's that asshole Archie again.

48:26.362 --> 48:27.988
How can you recognize him?

48:28.155 --> 48:31.491
Well, I didn't see his face,
but they all kind of look the same.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.660
Of course so do you guys.

48:34.036 --> 48:37.747
No offense. But l will remember
that pinky ring because it was awesome.

48:37.915 --> 48:42.294
He's got, like, a 10-carat, round cut,
square setting, good color and clarity.

48:42.461 --> 48:46.256
I remember thinking about the damage
it'd do to my face if he hit me.

48:54.849 --> 48:58.935
I gotta make sure Mr. Pinky Ring doesn't
recognize me, so I got a disguise.

48:59.103 --> 49:02.355
-How do we get in?
-Leave it to me. l'll take care of it.

49:02.523 --> 49:06.860
Hey, buddy. How you doing? How's
that armor-plated Lincoln I sold you?

49:07.028 --> 49:09.362
-Cops stopped me.
-They do that sometimes.

49:09.530 --> 49:11.364
-Car was fucking hot, Archie.
-Hey.

49:11.907 --> 49:15.702
I didn't steal it, but stop by the shop
tomorrow. l'll make it right.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.038
-You know the rules. No guests.
-He's not.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.206
He's a fighter. An unofficial entry.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.709
-Him? ls he any good?
-Is he--?

49:22.877 --> 49:24.919
He'll kick all those chumps' asses!

49:25.087 --> 49:27.213
He'll go Chinese on them!
Teeth will fly.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.050
Blood will splatter!
It'll be awesome! Step aside.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.968
No way, Archie. No more favors.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.638
What? You've got to be shitting me.

49:34.805 --> 49:38.391
Somebody's getting a letter from
the Better Business Bureau.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.393
Excuse us.

49:43.773 --> 49:46.274
You're number 12.
Go get your ass kicked.

49:50.863 --> 49:52.405
I didn't come here to fight.

49:52.573 --> 49:55.492
You don't have to fight,
I just said that to get us in.

50:13.636 --> 50:16.096
-Come on.
-Come on!

50:18.307 --> 50:20.934
Get up! Oh, yeah.

50:21.394 --> 50:22.644
Get up!

50:25.398 --> 50:26.439
Yeah! Yeah!

50:26.607 --> 50:28.441
Tear his eye out!

50:31.529 --> 50:34.989
-On a good day, over a million bucks--
-Just find the ring.

50:35.157 --> 50:38.952
-All right. Okay.
-Knock him out.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.788
-You know...
-Bullshit.

50:41.956 --> 50:46.876
...this could take a little while.
All right, come on. Let's go.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.773
Sit down.

51:22.997 --> 51:25.331
Why don't you put on some music?

51:28.586 --> 51:31.755
Uh-uh. Slower.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.302
Just relax.

51:38.512 --> 51:39.971
And watch.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.992
This looks good.

52:02.703 --> 52:04.913
Set it up, tie it at the bottom.

52:05.080 --> 52:10.919
-Tommy, go.
-Here come the bug man.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.393
Excuse me.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.729
Hey, what's going on, player?

52:32.149 --> 52:35.235
Get the bugs out
Gonna get the bugs out

52:35.402 --> 52:37.111
Gonna get the bugs out

52:37.279 --> 52:40.990
-What the hell are you doing?
-Oh, pest control, player.

52:43.661 --> 52:46.621
-Don't tell me you didn't get the notice.
-What notice?

52:46.789 --> 52:51.251
That's what burn my ass to the bone,
a brother just trying to make a living--

52:51.418 --> 52:53.920
You know what?
That's beside the point.

52:54.088 --> 52:57.632
If you had gotten your notice, you'd
realize the city has a new ordinance...

52:57.800 --> 53:00.677
...saying l gotta spray businesses
catering to foreigners.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.136
How come?

53:02.304 --> 53:06.015
The foreigners are bringing over
them scary-ass foreign bugs, man.

53:06.183 --> 53:10.520
They coming here in their luggage. lt's
my job to prevent possible infestation...

53:10.688 --> 53:14.023
-...and contamination. That's my job.
-We doing business inside.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.110
I can't let you come and hose
the place with bug spray.

53:17.278 --> 53:21.447
Maybe you need to talk to your manager
about that plan because that's my job.

53:21.615 --> 53:24.993
-Manager's busy.
-Okay, that's your call.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.786
That is your call, player.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.706
But just remember this.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.125
First thing tomorrow morning...

53:32.293 --> 53:33.626
...the city...

53:34.295 --> 53:37.046
-...they'll send their quarantine people.
-Quarantine people?

53:37.214 --> 53:40.258
They gonna shut you down.
Non-compliance.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.760
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.805
Hold, man, come here.
Let me talk to you for a minute.

53:49.518 --> 53:51.811
-You ain't fucking with me, are you?
-What?

53:54.356 --> 53:56.482
See that little motherfucker up there?

53:56.650 --> 53:58.359
That's me. That's me.

53:59.153 --> 54:03.823
I am a licensed exterminator, man.
Why l gotta fuck with you?

54:04.366 --> 54:07.827
Look. Come here. Let's do this.

54:07.995 --> 54:11.372
You take me to a small place.
Small room. Office or something.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.875
Someplace upstairs,
away from the customers.

54:14.043 --> 54:18.463
That way when I set these bombs off,
the fumes, they don't go down there.

54:18.631 --> 54:22.091
And then we come back later
and fix the rest. All right?

54:22.968 --> 54:26.512
-Okay. Get a couple bombs. Come on.
-That's what I'm talking about.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.557
You don't wanna be bit by one
of these motherfuckers.

54:29.725 --> 54:34.145
Swell you up all around the neck. Look
like Oprah. Come on, get the door.

56:20.461 --> 56:24.464
You know, some of these bugs
they got E. coli and Mad Cow disease.

56:24.631 --> 56:28.843
Check this shit out.
Is this Jackie Chan's office?

56:29.803 --> 56:32.180
Oh, snap!

56:32.347 --> 56:34.265
Man, you got a Jacuzzi?

56:34.433 --> 56:36.976
Look at the ball.
How many freaks you get in here?

56:37.144 --> 56:40.688
I bet you sit yours right there on
that ball. Sit on the ball, baby.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.941
Sit on the ball. Keep it wet, baby.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.151
-Smack!
-Hey!

56:45.319 --> 56:46.652
-Smack it! Smack it!
-Hey!

56:46.820 --> 56:50.740
-Just do your thing and go, bro.
-Yeah, all right, player.

56:55.996 --> 56:58.831
All right. Look here.
Now you keep the door closed...

56:58.999 --> 57:03.336
...and give this shit a full hour
before anybody steps in here, all right?

57:03.504 --> 57:09.342
Damn.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.513
-You're clear.
-Let's do it.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.348
All right.

57:28.237 --> 57:30.696
-You're crazy.
-I'm a father.

58:07.276 --> 58:11.028
Blow it. Daria, get ready to move.

58:17.077 --> 58:18.786
What was that?

58:19.746 --> 58:21.956
"Sometimes you just need
an old friend?"

58:27.462 --> 58:31.132
-It came from the office.
-Watch her. Don't let her leave.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.435
-They're not here?
-They're here.

58:42.603 --> 58:45.605
-They're just somewhere else.
-What are you talking about?

58:45.772 --> 58:49.150
-He stashed them here somewhere.
-What the hell we gonna do?

58:49.318 --> 58:51.986
-Everybody just go.
-But, T, what about you, man?

58:52.654 --> 58:55.448
I gotta save Vanessa. l gotta find them!

58:55.616 --> 58:57.867
-I'm not leaving you.
-Yes, you are. Now go!

58:58.493 --> 59:01.078
-Right here. Hurry up. Come on.
-Oh, shit.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.289
Come on, dog. They're right outside.

59:03.457 --> 59:05.958
Shut the fuck up and get out of here!

59:13.926 --> 59:16.052
You know, I got the big one.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.888
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

59:24.978 --> 59:26.520
Keep it in your pants.

59:27.022 --> 59:28.397
Who's in there?

59:37.866 --> 59:39.325
Hey, Fait.

59:43.163 --> 59:44.914
You're raw.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.629
-What you want?
-Ah.

59:52.881 --> 59:55.508
-Yeah!
-Move away from him.

59:59.137 --> 01:00:05.184
Nice cubic. Yours are real. Not.
I told you this was gonna take a while.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.437
I was thinking about those diamonds
so I made a few calls.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.024
My Defense Department connection
called me back and he tells me...

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:18.114
...about this rumor out of Taiwan about
these stones. Only they're not jewels.

01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:26.122
-Pretty beat up.
-Fell down the stairs.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.623
Enjoy the jail sex, Fait.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:38.718
7 advances, 11's out!
Next up, 8 versus 12!

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:40.886
8 versus 12!

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.056
Fighters report to the cage!

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:46.934
Let's go.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.776
We're still here, T.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:58.237
Got anything you want us to do?

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:01.365
-Nothing yet.
-What?

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.659
Nothing. Nothing.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.842
Unofficial entry number 12!

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:24.805
-Unofficial entry number 12!
-Hey, 12's right here!

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.932
Kind of small, ain't he?

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:30.936
Let's go, chickenshit.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.147
You're the chickenshit, buddy!

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.316
Not today.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:39.111
I know this wasn't the plan,
but if you don't get in and fight...

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.114
...they'll throw us out
and we'll never find this guy.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.117
-Sorry.
-Just find the ring.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:58.381
-Hey. Two grand on the white guy.
-You got it, Archie.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.299
Let's go! Come on!

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.134
Are you ready? Are you ready?

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.666
You win.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.335
-You suck.
-Shit.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:40.714
No quitting! Get your ass back in there!

01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:52.685
Put me down! Goddamn! Come on!

01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:02.695
-Put me down or l'll kick your ass, Bruce!
-I'm not Bruce.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:17.460
Come on. Get up.
Get out of here. Get out of here.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.045
Kick his ass!

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.881
Come on! Kick his ass!

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.801
Kick him. Take him down.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.766
-Okay. He's all patched up.
-Ready to move.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:36.896
Let's go.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.239
Get the car. Stay close.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.669
Hey! That guy's got my fucking quad!

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.464
I'm gonna get that motherfucker!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.062
Hey! Wait!

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.132
-Five grand on the Chinaman. My friend.
-Got you.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.481
At this very moment, a man
identified as Anthony Fait is leading...

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:06.151
...police on a wild high-speed chase
through downtown Los Angeles.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:09.822
And get this, folks.
He's driving an all-terrain vehicle.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:06:08.922
Yeah!

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.972
Come on! Kick his ass!

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.388
Oh, yeah!

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:26.018
Come on. Come on down.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:35.903
That's the way to get that buck.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.270
-Yo.
-I'm here.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.148
Aboveground parking garage
in Chinatown. Get there.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.067
I know the place.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.810
Hey. Thanks, man.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.816
-Do you like my new ring?
-Where is he?

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.818
Well, open the door.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.364
Glad I brought my stunner.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:06.201
All right, bud. You ready for the q and a?
Where'd you put the stones?

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:10.998
I ain't selling you shit till
I know where the ceiling is.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.042
How much money
do you want for the stones?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.628
-Where's my fucking butter?
-It's almost ready.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:23.176
See, l hate foreplay. Fucking warm-up.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:26.847
A bitch gotta be ready to come off
the bench and score some points.

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:31.810
Just take the rock to the motherfucking
hoop strong. You dig?

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:38.650
Instead of doing this back-and-forth shit,
my idea is you come up with a number.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:42.821
A very high number. You see,
I'm throwing a number so high...

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:48.535
...that when l hear it just....
It just gets me off.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:53.540
And then, bam! Bust a nut,
roll over, go to sleep.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.709
You like that?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.170
Yeah, l like that.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.387
Oh, shit!

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.932
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:13.352
Shit! Okay, okay, okay!

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:17.689
It looks like this garage is
where it will end. Police have sealed...

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.943
...the building and continue
their search inside for the man who...

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.821
...led them on what certainly had to be
the most extreme chase we've seen.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:28.533
-Don't know why these idiots do it.
-They never get away, do they?

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:32.162
They don't, and they just endanger
innocent citizens in the process.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.040
Here's another car exiting the structure.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:38.460
Police talking to the driver,
inspecting the vehicle.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:42.172
Well, the police know they have him
trapped inside the parking structure.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.218
Knowing cops the way I do, I can say
they're PO'd, excuse my language.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:49.554
And they're not about to let this guy
slip through their fingers.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.561
Mr. Chambers is resting.
He says not to bother him.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.828
Hey, baby.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.372
Please don't go.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.541
You want me to stay?

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.419
Yeah, l need someone to stay
and help keep me awake.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:21.795
Wait a minute.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.880
l know that face.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:28.301
A lot of men had that look on their face
when l got married.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.689
I knew the stones were in there.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.275
He was a tough guy,
but when l got close...

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.610
...to his nuts he sang like CÃ©line Dion.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.114
How we gonna
get them out of there?

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.074
That place is always jumping.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.909
Yo, dog, something's not right.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:54.286
I got the same feeling.

01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:55.912
The doorman.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:57.622
Where is he?

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:01.668
Everybody stay put.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:08.133
-Sorry.
-Watch my nuts, all right?

01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.443
No Chambers' guys.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:28.236
Something's wrong.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.924
This guy looks better dead.

01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:52.052
He said they were here in the fountain.

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.514
Where are they?

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:01.019
This can't be fucking happening.
They have to be here!

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:12.906
That's it? One stone?

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:16.535
-Ling. He has the rest.
-How the fuck do you know?

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:18.620
I know.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:27.379
Okay. He has the stones.

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:31.216
I mean, she can't hurt him.
She's just a little girl.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:36.721
She's only 8 years old. He'll let her
go, right? He'll just fucking let her go!

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.397
What am I gonna do?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.358
We have to go.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.451
Now.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.540
-We're back in business.
-Good.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:07.043
-We don't have to babysit much longer.
-I hate kids.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.881
-Is everything else ready?
-Just have to test the device.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.425
It's called the Dimaster Oscillator.

01:15:13.593 --> 01:15:19.097
Not test. Calibrate.
Which l'm now ready to do.

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:23.935
Goggles?

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.168
Here you go, man.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:49.961
Thanks.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:25.622
Please work. Please work.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:27.791
Please work.

01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.887
Daddy, please. Daddy, please.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.434
Please answer, Daddy, answer.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.478
Want me to get that?

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.651
-Yeah?
-Daddy?

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.069
Vanessa?

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.321
Daddy, please, come and get me...

01:16:58.489 --> 01:16:59.906
...I wanna go home!

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:03.326
Calm down, baby. Calm down.
Where are you?

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:04.577
I don't know!

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:07.163
I'm in a van inside a big building.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.457
They painted the windows.
I can't look out!

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.752
You gotta help me, sweetheart.
I have to know where you are.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.213
-I'm scared!
-I know you are, honey.

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:19.092
Just try to stay calm. Concentrate.
Look around. What do you see?

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:22.178
I don't know. I can't see anything.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.265
You gotta try, sweetheart.
Try to see something.

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.893
I'm going. l'm trying.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:38.069
I see chairs and green light.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:40.196
Chairs. Green light.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.073
Where's the light coming from?

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.785
I can't tell. There's a machine.
It's like a laser show.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:48.163
-Laser show?
-Daddy...

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.622
...hurry! l'm scared!

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.000
-I wanna go home!
-Okay, baby. Calm down.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.586
It's gonna be okay.
Daddy's coming!

01:17:58.299 --> 01:17:59.341
Daddy?

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:01.259
-Vanessa?
-Daddy!

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:02.719
Vanessa?

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.388
Vanessa!

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.766
Great!

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:09.309
Shit!

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:13.063
-He's doing it here tonight.
-Doing what?

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:18.193
Selling the stones. The Thai laser emits
green light. He needs it to enrich them.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:21.404
-To show their power.
-What are you talking about?

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:22.947
What are these stones?

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.660
A new form of synthetic plutonium.
Portable, but mega-powerful. Right?

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:31.456
There's a bunch of international
scumbags who'd pay a lot of money...

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.584
...to get their hands on those.
And then, look out world.

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:35.794
Enough of this!

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:38.880
How's it gonna get me
back my daughter?

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.262
We're operational.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:52.143
The buyers will want to arrive
and leave quickly.

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:56.398
Somewhere private,
accessible by aircraft.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.983
Vanessa did say she was inside
of a big building.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.235
Could be a hangar.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:03.154
There's about a dozen
little airports around here.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.573
We ain't gonna never get them all.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.867
-Flight plans.
-Yeah, flight plans.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.496
They gotta list a destination.
Every aircraft that takes off...

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:15.834
...has to file one with the Aviation
Administration or risk getting shot...

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.503
...by the U.S. military.
So you get that list...

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:21.339
...and maybe we can find out where
the sale's going down.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:25.343
Daria, call the aviation people.
Use our L.A.P.D. credentials.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.638
We need flight info on all aircrafts
coming in or going out.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:32.350
Miles, the no-gun policy is
no longer in effect. Break out the heat.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:36.729
Everybody else, get ready to move.
Tommy, create a diversion.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.898
I got just the thing if we can fit in it.

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:58.376
Wick Airfield. Five private choppers
arriving tonight within minutes.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:02.046
-Sounds like our best bet.
-Better be for Vanessa's sake.

01:20:02.715 --> 01:20:04.215
Let's go.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.889
You are the world's foremost
arms dealers.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:15.560
You all know weaponry equals power,
and in the world of weaponry...

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:16.895
...nukes rule.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:21.441
But nuclear material is hard to obtain
and difficult to handle.

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:24.235
But what if it weren't?

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.113
That's the question that brought
you here tonight.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:32.243
And this is the answer.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:37.165
A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.584
Zero radiation...

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.839
...zero volatility.

01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:48.676
One small fragment easily transformed
into a source of immense energy.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:55.099
More powerful than weapons-grade
plutonium 100 times its size.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.609
Goggles on.

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:13.076
So, what the hell does Taiwan
gotta do with this?

01:21:13.244 --> 01:21:15.954
We developed the stones.
They belong to us.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:19.791
What about the guy you're after?
How come you know him so well?

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:23.086
We grew up together. We joined
the government at the same time.

01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:26.172
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You were on the same side?

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.385
He betrayed us. He killed our team.
He tried to kill me too.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:33.471
If you don't take this
motherfucker out, l will.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:36.975
The stones first, then him.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.862
Creating a highly reactive
radioactive isotope...

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:53.449
...requires altering the atomic structure
of the original material.

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:59.831
Normally this is accomplished
by adding neutrons.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:04.335
Here, we're using electromagnetic
distillation to strip away protons.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:10.008
In the process, the fragment's potential
yield is increasing exponentially.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:19.183
We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.145
Enough power to take out a tank.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:33.615
A Tomahawk cruise missile,
enough to destroy a building.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:39.996
Scud.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:43.124
That's a few city blocks gone.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:50.715
Hiroshima.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.721
Two Hiroshimas.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:13.196
New world order.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.588
The purpose of today's sale
is to begin trading...

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:35.134
...a new commodity on the black market
and to determine its value.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.179
There are 50 stones available
in the first sale.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.974
And the opening bid
is $200,000 per stone.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:45.561
Bids, please.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.980
I'll bid one million for five stones.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.568
-I'll bid 1.2 million for five stones.
-1.5 for five stones.

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:55.196
-1.7 million for five stones.
-2 million.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.573
-5 million for six stones!
-5.2!

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.659
-5.7 for six!
-Sold.

01:23:59.827 --> 01:24:02.453
-Seven million for 10 stones!
-8.5 for 10!

01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:06.624
Miles, what do you see?

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:09.877
We got five choppers.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:13.589
Two armed sentries.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:15.967
Checking the perimeter.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.554
Perimeter is clear.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:23.725
I'm moving inside.
They're still doing the deal.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:28.855
There's a camper there.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.525
-And the windows is painted out.
-Vanessa said she was in a van.

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:34.819
Can't see out. It's gotta be it!

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.904
Once we get her,
you two disappear fast.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:38.197
I'll keep her safe.

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:41.743
-8.7 million for 10 stones!
-9 million for 10 stones!

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.995
-9.8 for 10.
-10 million for 10 stones!

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:46.414
-Sold! There are 37 stones.
-16 million!

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.666
Miles! Hit them!

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.504
Done.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:56.799
Tommy and Archie,
watch the van. Punch it!

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.344
-24.5 for 15!
-24 and three quarters--

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:01.846
25 for 15!

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:10.605
Freeze, motherfuckers!

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:13.691
I knew it.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.867
You heard the man. Party's over!

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:24.994
-l knew it.
-Just be cool.

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:27.163
Fucking amateurs.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.125
Come on, man, just be cool!

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:34.212
I said, don't move, motherfucker!

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.724
She's out! She's out!
She's on the move.

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:50.311
Another time.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.949
-There's a guy after her.
-Stay right here. I'll go get her.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:07.161
-Holy shit!
-Come to Papa!

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:15.086
Shit! That motherfucker's shooting!

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.840
-What do we do?
-Shoot him!

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.508
Easy for you to say!

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:44.365
You do him.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.057
Don't let him get away!

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.643
Oh, shit! Shit! Archie, l'm out of ammo!

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:15.187
-Fire the M-60!
-Get me closer!

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:17.940
Give me that!

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.967
How many times do we have to kill you?

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:56.979
Get him! l got this.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:07.031
Go! Go!

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.329
-Go!
-All right!

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.279
-What happened?
-I don't know!

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:48.531
We're out of balance!

01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:00.167
Retract the landing gear! Do it!
Do it now!

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.546
Shoot him down!

01:29:03.714 --> 01:29:05.381
Shit! l'm out of ammo! What now?

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:06.632
Shoot him down!

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.300
-Load the cannon.
-How?

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:11.887
-Put the giant bullet into the hole!
-Oh, shit.

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:13.097
Oh, shit!

01:29:21.732 --> 01:29:25.276
-There he is! There he is! l got him!
-Archie, shoot this motherfucker!

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.781
We're hit!

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:35.619
-Hey! Hey!
-You shot him in the ass!

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:36.954
We got it!

01:30:14.868 --> 01:30:15.910
Shit!

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:19.622
Time to end this my way.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.876
-Let her go!
-Let go! Daddy!

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.587
Daddy!

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.848
Damn! No shot.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:43.521
You were lucky last time.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:48.317
You won't be lucky again.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:26.647
Daddy!

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.000
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:33:35.652 --> 01:33:36.860
Wrong kid!

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.115
Definitely the wrong father!

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:36.045
-My baby!
-Daddy, I knew you'd find me!

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:38.088
So glad the angels kept you safe.

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:44.762
Another one?

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:46.430
You know it.

01:34:51.978 --> 01:34:55.773
Never gonna let you go. Ever.

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:16.752
Guess we both got what we wanted.

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:21.173
So, what happens to the stones now?

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:23.634
They'll be destroyed.

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:29.932
Guess l'll be spending some time in jail.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.642
Jail?

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:36.271
Come on, man. He just saved the planet,
man. Can't he at least get probation?

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:37.648
I'll do what I can.

01:35:37.816 --> 01:35:38.982
-Thanks.
-Great.

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:42.319
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:45.155
You're law enforcement.
But we gotta stick together.

01:35:45.323 --> 01:35:47.491
And a white guy comes in handy.

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:51.453
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:53.872
-So, what percentage are we talking?
-None.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.791
That low, huh?

01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:00.212
It's about time l got my shit together.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:03.841
-About time we all did.
-I'm with you, T.

01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:07.594
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:10.764
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun....

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:17.187
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:27.614
Faith.

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.932
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:37.351
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:39.978
I could do it. I've had straight jobs.
Have you?

01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:43.065
-I've had plenty of straight jobs.
-Really? Name one.

01:37:44.234 --> 01:37:45.776
I sold Avon.

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:49.530
-You were an Avon lady?
-I was an Avon man. All right?

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.949
-You got a problem with that?
-No, it's fair.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:54.201
-Why you looking at me like that?
-It's okay.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.662
All right. All right.

01:37:56.913 --> 01:38:01.833
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. Don't be disrespecting her.

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:04.670
-I know her. Remember the party?
-She whipped your ass.

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:06.380
No, she sucker-punched me.

01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:09.675
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:12.427
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:15.138
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:19.101
No, I said l have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:22.479
-Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
-Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

01:38:22.647 --> 01:38:25.148
You can see it when she's sitting
on your head.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:28.944
I've seen it. l had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

01:38:29.112 --> 01:38:32.364
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:36.243
Yeah. l shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:38.495
-Yeah. You know what?
-What?

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:43.500
I'm gonna write a movie about the shit
we got through. l've been taking notes.

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:46.753
It's gonna make a lot of money.
I'm calling it Sidekicks.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.881
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:52.926
-Who's playing you?
-I've been thinking about that.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.388
I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then l saw him at the gas station--

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:57.931
-Midget.
-He's like 5'6".

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.975
-Midget.
-Got a terrible lisp.

01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:02.686
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

01:39:02.854 --> 01:39:04.563
Right. I see the forehead.

01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:07.024
-Yeah. And you? Guess.
-Denzel!

01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.275
Denzel!

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:11.862
-You noticed l've been cutting it down.
-And he's been beefing up.

01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:16.742
-I try to get down to Denzel's weight.
-Know who'll be your girlfriend? Oprah.

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:18.910
-Big Oprah or little Oprah?
-Medium Oprah.

01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:21.246
That's the one I like.
The eyes are straight.

01:39:21.414 --> 01:39:23.540
-This is about reality.
-Right. Realism.

01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:25.876
-Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
-Who?

01:39:26.044 --> 01:39:29.880
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:32.883
This is an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

01:39:33.176 --> 01:39:34.259
-Uh-huh.
-Also, Fait.

01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:37.888
I've been thinking about
that a lot. l'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

01:39:38.056 --> 01:39:41.350
The most dominating player ever
in the NBA. You saw Kazaam.

01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.644
-Right
-It wasn't the right material.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:47.564
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, l've been thinking about him.

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:50.400
-Remember the movie Sixteen Candles?
-Yeah.

01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:52.903
-Who am l thinking about?
-Molly Ringwald?

01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:55.072
-No, the Donger!
-Oh! Okay!

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.824
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.327
-He waiting tables someplace.
-He was funny!

01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:04.581
-Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
-Daria? Who you got?

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:07.501
-Winona Ryder.
-Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:09.920
-Yeah, she's good.
-She'd play a thief.

01:40:10.088 --> 01:40:13.298
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:16.927
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:20.931
-Electricity went through her body.
-She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

01:40:21.099 --> 01:40:23.350
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.102
You know what?

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:29.606
We should get the dude that directed
Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds.

01:40:29.774 --> 01:40:32.359
-The director, the Pole, Polack.
-The Polack?

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:35.278
Yeah, we'll get him in there.
Exit Wounds, did you see that?

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:37.030
-I saw that.
-The best part--

01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:38.281
-The end.
-The very end.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:42.577
-Over the credits. The rest sucked.
-Can't have the movie without the end.

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:45.831
-There's no movie.
-Whatever happened with those guys?

01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:47.165
I heard they're gay.

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:50.752
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.
