there was a tiny little village
of dairy farmers,

15:20.210 --> 15:22.087
living fat off their milk and cheese.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.132
When the drought came,
they needed water from the river.

-China people, whatever.

The point is, they were laying around
in hammocks waiting for rain.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.310
So a wise man gathered a bunch of twigs

15:36.393 --> 15:38.604
and stuffed it
under the sleeping villagers.

-Lit a fire under them?

Except that hibachis are from Japan,
not China,

historically, or hammocks.

my bullshit to know what I was up to.
