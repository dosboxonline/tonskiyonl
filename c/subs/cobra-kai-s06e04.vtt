WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:15.765
The Sekai Taikai is coming.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.852
It's up to us
to pick our six most badass fighters.

00:18.935 --> 00:23.606
And there are no easy decisions.
We know you all wanna go to Barcelona.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.608
Some of you think you're shoo-ins,

00:26.609 --> 00:30.864
that you're at the top of your game,
that nothing or no one can stop you.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.657
Some of you think you're the underdogs,

00:33.324 --> 00:35.535
and you don't know
if you have what it takes,

00:35.618 --> 00:38.663
and that you feel left out
and left behind.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.208
But it's a level playing field.
Anything can happen.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.836
Each and every one of you
has a shot.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.591
So, as we make our evaluations,
do your best.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.218
Now is not the time to puss out.

00:52.302 --> 00:56.222
Even though we're competing
against each other, we are still one dojo.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.561
And it's time to bring out the best

01:01.644 --> 01:02.854
in all of us.

01:02.937 --> 01:06.900
So, which of you has what it takes
to be in our top six?

01:21.206 --> 01:24.042
Y'all think there's any chance
we don't make it in the top six?

01:24.125 --> 01:25.919
Maybe when hell freezes over.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.755
Let's hope there's not
a tournament category for humility.

01:28.838 --> 01:32.050
Oh, come on. We got two All Valley champs
and two runner-ups.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.551
I mean, you're a no-brainer.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.970
It's really only that sixth spot
that's up for grabs.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.847
Yeah, and it's yours for the taking.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.684
I appreciate the support,
but I ran a statistical analysis.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.063
And while there is
an 18% chance you're right,

01:45.146 --> 01:46.439
the smart money is on Kenny.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.566
I mean, he did beat you
in that head-to-head.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.485
Uh, cheap shot notwithstanding.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.948
Okay, Payne's got power. But so do you.
Don't count yourself out, man.

01:55.031 --> 01:59.452
Hmm. I prefer to focus
on something actually achievable.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.787
Getting into MIT.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.331
Early Action decisions
come out any day now, you know.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.707
Yeah, I know.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.293
Hey, man, come on. Have no fear.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.463
I may not have confidence
about becoming a world karate champion,

02:10.547 --> 02:15.051
but I know that MIT
cannot turn down the Binary Bros.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.970
God, I hope I get to go to Barcelona.

02:17.053 --> 02:20.014
I don't see how they could leave you home.
You got speed and agility.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.726
You've got just as much of a shot as me.
I saw you land that point on Robby.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.979
- Ah, it was a lucky shot.
Sure was.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.441
I wouldn't get your hopes up, LaRusso.
No way you and I are both going.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.154
- And I'm definitely going.
Senseis said it was anyone's game.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.823
- All right. Let's see you bring it.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.171
We've put this off long enough.
It's time we've had the talk.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.714
I agree.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.633
I want a 15% bump
and control of the showroom music.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.760
You just got here.
You're not getting a raise.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.596
I'm talking about the Sekai Taikai.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.890
We have to choose our top six.

03:03.892 --> 03:08.396
Sam, Robby, Miguel, Hawk.
I'd change the order, but yeah, I agree.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.815
Wait, your fifth is Demetri?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.443
The nerd's got reach,
but no way he's in before Tory.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.030
Tory's skills are undeniable, but is she
balanced enough to commit to Miyagi-Do?

03:17.113 --> 03:20.116
The girl's a beast. Miyagi himself
would have ranked her even above you.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.828
The guy wasn't afraid
to knock a few skulls around now and then.

03:23.912 --> 03:24.829
Mine included.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.416
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Anthony?

03:28.499 --> 03:29.334
Come on.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.754
Trying to make the Sekai Taikai
a LaRusso family vacation?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.464
Okay, who would your sixth be?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.423
Lee.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.092
Devon? You only want her
because she's pure Eagle Fang.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.054
Why are you so obsessed with dojo history?
I thought we were all Miyagi-Do.

03:41.137 --> 03:41.971
We are.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.058
Clearly, we have our own biases.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.310
We gotta figure out
some way to get this settled.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.897
Uh, and before you say it,
no, you and I are not fighting.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.232
What about the kids?

03:52.315 --> 03:57.570
Cutthroat, no-holds-barred Battle Royale.
The last six standing go to Barcelona.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.865
Sure, that's all we need. Everyone showing
up with black eyes and broken limbs.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.701
No, we need to find a fair solution.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.705
What we would need is a karate expert
who doesn't know the kids.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.797
I got a bad idea.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.971
Please welcome our guest for the weekend,
Sensei Barnes.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.182
- Isn't that guy at the Silver house fight?
- Silence!

04:28.977 --> 04:29.894
I like this guy.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.605
In order to keep things unbiased,

04:32.689 --> 04:37.026
we brought in Sensei Barnes to observe
then select our top six.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.654
During my years as the Tournament Terror,

04:40.363 --> 04:43.116
all I wanted was
to be in the Sekai Taikai.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.410
But I blew my chance.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.748
I am here to ensure
that you maximize yours.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.877
Everyone I know
who has participated in this

04:54.961 --> 04:56.796
has horror stories.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.673
This thing is intense.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.925
Unpredictable.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.803
People have died. Move!

05:05.471 --> 05:07.265
Who's ready for that?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.518
Wait. Ready for the tournament or to die?

05:10.601 --> 05:14.272
I will do to you
what the Sekai Taikai will do.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.775
I will surprise you with events.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.404
I will push you to your limits.

05:22.905 --> 05:26.993
And if any of you delicate flowers feel
like going to your senseis and crying,

05:27.076 --> 05:28.411
don't.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.622
I've been given full authority
for these eliminations.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.208
Selections. Let's keep this positive.

05:35.793 --> 05:36.794
You came to me.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.756
The deal was my way or the highway.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.428
Get on the sparring deck.

05:46.971 --> 05:47.847
Now!

05:59.317 --> 06:01.527
Uh, Sensei Barnes,
before we start…

06:02.320 --> 06:03.154
Listen, Mike--

06:03.237 --> 06:05.323
This looks different
since the last time I was here.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.496
Yeah. It's good to be back.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.168
And what could possibly go wrong?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.212
To survive the first round,

06:19.295 --> 06:21.339
you will need to show me
excellence and speed.

06:23.674 --> 06:28.304

07:37.665 --> 07:39.459
Congratulations.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.002
You didn't die.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.714
Still, half of you wouldn't last one match
at the Sekai Taikai.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.466
To the 12 who might,

07:47.216 --> 07:49.135
join me up here when I call your name.

07:50.052 --> 07:50.887
Hawk.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.225
Robby.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.395
Miguel.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.231
- Yeah.
- Sam.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.233
Tory.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.486
Muscles.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.571
What?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.326
- Yeah, you.
- I have a new nickname?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.243
Get up here.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.495
I have a new nickname!

08:18.414 --> 08:21.459
What's up, ladies?
Name's Muscles. Nice to meet you.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.418
Okay.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.253
Kenny.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.593
Kenny, good job.
No one ever catches the chicken.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.639
Nate.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.100
- Chris.
- Oh, Chris!

08:39.644 --> 08:40.728
Only three left.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.230
I'm a goner.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.648
Demetri.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.989
Oh, right. Devon.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.495
And the last name.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.372
Anthony.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.373
Yes!

09:02.708 --> 09:04.460
How do you like them apples, huh?

09:05.127 --> 09:09.257
Congratulations, top 12.
Meet me back here tomorrow for round two.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.093
To the rest of you, you're out.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.761
Better luck next time.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.514
You two.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.599
Fierce. Keep it up.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.731
Look at you. Hard work paying off.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.275
Yeah. Yeah.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.777
But no way I make it past this next round.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.822
I won the All Valley with less.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.782
The underdog always has a shot.

09:35.783 --> 09:36.909
Keep it up, Anthony.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.248
Good job, Robby.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.212
Lee, you kicked ass out there.
Why do you look so pissed?

09:48.296 --> 09:52.091
You know,
I won the endurance challenge.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.844
But who does
substitute sensei congratulate?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.598
Kenny, for the chicken.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.142
Sam and Tory for being "fierce."

10:01.225 --> 10:03.603
What about me? I'm fierce too.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.771
He put you through
to the next round, didn't he?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.065
Yeah, but after the power couples
and Hawk,

10:08.149 --> 10:10.276
there's really only one spot up for grabs.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.862
I can't win it
if the judge doesn't see me.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.948
I just don't wanna disappoint you.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.075
Listen, you're not gonna disappoint me.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.745
Don't worry. You're totally getting in.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.663
Okay?

10:54.111 --> 10:56.530
- Is that protein powder?
- Uh, no.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.449
It's laxatives.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.952
I've been a little stressed, so I wasn't
able to poop the last few days.

11:02.536 --> 11:03.412
Want some?

11:04.246 --> 11:05.623
That's gross, Penis Breath.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.334
Hey. It's Muscles now.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.543
Muscles, right.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.715
<i>Cobra Kai</i>
<i>doesn't follow the same rules.</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:18.344
We have to be ready
for any dirty trick they throw at us.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.305
Like when Chong Li threw dirt
into Van Damme's eyes in <i>Bloodsport.</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:22.264
<i>Exactly.</i>

11:23.933 --> 11:25.309
- Yes!
- Winner!

11:29.230 --> 11:30.648
<i>I'm sorry, Sensei.</i>

11:30.731 --> 11:32.400
You apologize for what?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
<i>I didn't win.</i>

11:34.026 --> 11:35.611
And whose fault is that?

11:50.167 --> 11:51.168
Hey!

11:52.378 --> 11:55.172
Can any of you nerds tell me
where I can find my boyfriend?

11:58.634 --> 11:59.468
Thank you.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.180
Nice karate pajamas.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.474
Uh, thank you. Thank you.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.684
Thank you.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.564
Hey.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.065
You ready for our hot date?

12:13.149 --> 12:17.403
I got us the corner booth at Islands.
There is a Bleunami with your name on it.

12:17.903 --> 12:21.532
It's, uh, just a regular hamburger,
but there's blue cheese on it.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.745
I was thinking, if you need to stay
and train, we can reschedule.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.458
Oh, no, no. There's…
there is no need, my golden goddess.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.086
The way I see it,
disappointment is easiest to manage

12:34.170 --> 12:36.380
when you don't expect
too much of yourself to begin with.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.176
I've come as far as I'm gonna go.
I can live with that.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.928
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
They're not gonna hold it all day.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.680
Ew!

12:45.598 --> 12:47.558
"Ew"? "Ew"? What's "ew"? "Ew"?

12:47.641 --> 12:49.268
This whole loser vibe.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.812
It's the opposite of a turn-on.
I don't date losers.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.023
- You're breaking up with me?
- No!

12:54.899 --> 12:56.233
Because you're not a loser.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.527
I believe in you.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.406
But that only matters
if you believe in yourself.

13:05.117 --> 13:05.993
Okay.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.955
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You're right.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.583
- I'm gonna go out there.
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.085
- I'm gonna train as long as it takes.
- Yes, you are.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.171
And I am gonna win
this whole freaking thing.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.215
Oh my God, that is so hot!

13:20.341 --> 13:21.342
Oh!

13:21.425 --> 13:24.261
And even if I don't
actually believe in myself--

13:24.345 --> 13:25.262
Shh.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.105
Thank you.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.315
Ready for the big day?

13:36.398 --> 13:40.277
Oh, I was born ready. Just like MIT,
you're not going to Barcelona without me.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.073
What, bro?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.242
Every time he mentions MIT, you go gray.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.744
I didn't apply.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.539
What? Why?

13:51.622 --> 13:55.417
That frat party we went to made me realize
I never even looked at any other schools.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.586
We picked MIT
before all this karate stuff.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.673
I just wanna see
if there's a better option.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.384
I… I hear you, but MIT is pretty great.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.262
I know. It's all Demetri can talk about.
It's killing me.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.138
You should tell him.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.520
Top 12, get ready.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.607
Today's challenge is a Battle Royale.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.651
The rules are simple.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.653
Protect your flags.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.655
Steal the others.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.699
Lose your flags,

14:27.491 --> 14:28.450
and you're out.

14:29.368 --> 14:33.038
The ones with the most flags at the end
go to Barcelona.

14:33.581 --> 14:37.251
The rest of you
will be judged on performance.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.961
You have two minutes.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.380
Little tip. Keep an eye on Devon today.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.174
Yeah. I'll be watching everyone. Ready?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.268
And fight!

15:25.132 --> 15:26.759
Coming for you, LaRusso!

15:39.605 --> 15:41.065
- Shit!
- Sorry, buddy!

15:47.196 --> 15:48.447
Yes!

15:48.530 --> 15:50.199
Hey, you see that? Badass, right?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.826
How many times
am I gonna have to tell you? Back off.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.620
What's with the attitude, man?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.789
You're talking to a champion.
I know what I'm doing.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.832
Yeah? Well, I'm a champion too.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.918
Of the Valley. I was national.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.670
Don't diss the Valley, man.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.630
Johnny. What are you doing?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.050
Thanks, Lee.

16:09.051 --> 16:09.885
Huh.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.262
Damn it!

16:14.974 --> 16:15.849
Ais!

16:16.558 --> 16:18.602
Okay, man. Two to two.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.313
- Ais!
- Gotcha. That's two to one.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.190
Ah, shit, dude.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.108
Yoink!

16:24.942 --> 16:26.110
One to one.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.028
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Ha!

16:31.657 --> 16:33.409
- Sorry, man.
- Shit!

16:38.163 --> 16:40.666
Underdogs always have a shot.
Underdogs always have a shot.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.088
- Ais!
- This is my shot!

16:47.589 --> 16:49.800
You thought you had a shot. Shit!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.430
All right, that was lucky.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.188
Time! That's it!

17:03.272 --> 17:04.231
Yes!

17:04.314 --> 17:05.649
Anthony!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.236
Oh, sh-shit.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.363
- I'm sorry, LaRusso.
- Are you okay?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.576
If it isn't obvious, LaRusso, you're out.
Nice hit, Kenny.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.579
Seriously? My son is bleeding here.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.247
Well, you better get used to it, Daniel,

17:20.330 --> 17:22.958
because the Sekai Taikai is gonna do
a hell of a lot worse.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.419
What's your deal, man?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.838
It's like you're slipping back
into Bad Boy Barnes.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.382
Maybe that's a good thing.
If I'd been my old self,

17:30.466 --> 17:33.427
maybe Silver wouldn't have burned
my business to the ground.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.931
Let me see those flags.

17:38.766 --> 17:39.850
Come on!

17:48.776 --> 17:50.819
All right, we've clearly got our top four.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.112
Tory.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.280
Robby.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.323
Sam.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.324
Miguel.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.326
You four are going to Barcelona.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
You bottom four are tied.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.916
I'll go back tonight and review my notes,

18:04.416 --> 18:06.126
re-tally the scores.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.836
I'll announce the final two
in the morning.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.714
Unbelievable.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.804
Hey, what's wrong?
Barnes was watching you this whole time.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.932
Yeah, but he missed
all of my good moments.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.602
I… I don't know
what you two were arguing about,

18:23.685 --> 18:26.688
but I'll be shocked
if he chooses me after that shit show.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.528
All right.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.156
Looks like the bleeding stopped.
You're gonna live.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.325
You wanna go back out, see who won?

18:40.160 --> 18:43.497
It's just a bloody nose. You shoulda seen
the time I got spaghetti--

18:43.580 --> 18:46.625
- Why weren't you real with me, Dad?
- What?

18:46.708 --> 18:49.211
I mean, you made me believe
that I actually had a chance,

18:49.294 --> 18:50.712
and now everyone thinks I'm a joke.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.047
That's not true.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.883
No matter what I do, I can't win.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.304
Ant, win, lose, it doesn't matter.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.975
You just keep doing your best,
and you'll have everyone's respect.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.978
I just wanna go home.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.229
Hey. Anthony.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.496
Hey, man. Cool shop.

19:30.002 --> 19:34.381
Hey, man, I came to apologize for,
you know… stepping on your toes earlier.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.466
It's all right. I get it.

19:36.550 --> 19:40.762
I mean, it's gotta be hard for an alpha
like you to battle a bigger one.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.098
Well, I wouldn't put it like that.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.767
You didn't come to apologize.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.562
You came to see if Devon made the cut.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.356
Yeah, well, did she?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.274
No.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.652
As a matter of fact,
she was at the bottom of my list.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.154
Is she new to karate?

19:57.779 --> 20:00.657
They're all new to karate.
But yeah, she's a quick study.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.702
Maybe she's studying the wrong thing.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.623
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

20:09.958 --> 20:14.713
You Miyagi-Dos, you're good at kata,
meditation, that kind of crap.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.008
Doesn't exactly produce
powerhouse students, now, does it?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.469
I could teach you about power.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.846
That's cute, Johnny.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.806
I mean, you know, you've got some skills.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.725
I'm just built different.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.270
Yeah, you're different.
You're nothing but a goon for hire.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.775
- "Goon for hire"?
- Yeah.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.737
Well, I suppose it's better
than being a cream puff.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.412
What did I tell you? Cream puff.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.038
Your karate is a joke.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.665
I own--

21:43.051 --> 21:45.971
Enough. All right. You win. You win.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.558
Sorry.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.394
Sorry about all this, man.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.063
It's my fault.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.943
You know, ever since you guys
brought karate back into my life,

22:00.027 --> 22:02.487
I have been… itching for a fight.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.198
I guess I thought it would help me

22:06.033 --> 22:07.326
recapture some

22:08.618 --> 22:10.746
sense of my power or something.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.248
I know how you feel.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.296
Just do me a solid.

22:19.379 --> 22:23.759
Just check that little diary of yours
and see if you gave Devon a fair shake.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.302
All right?

22:26.386 --> 22:28.513
A favor from one bad boy to another.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.615
Why'd Barnes call us out here?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.784
He could have announced
the final two at the dojo.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.953
- Yeah, why invite us losers?
- Hey.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.331
So you can see
what winning looks like, right?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.335
Good morning.

22:58.418 --> 22:59.419
At least for now.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.338
Gather 'round.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.006
Is everybody here?

23:03.090 --> 23:05.634
- Yeah, this is everyone.
- Good.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.762
Last night, I reviewed my notes.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.182
Made sure the remaining four
got a fair shake.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.269
I've decided

23:16.895 --> 23:18.271
it's too close to call.

23:19.356 --> 23:23.819
So… you're all gonna get
another opportunity to prove yourselves.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.946
Two flags

23:26.738 --> 23:28.323
wait deep in the forest.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.993
Whoever brings them back… wins.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.078
Wait. That's it?

23:33.954 --> 23:36.373
What if two of us find a flag
at the same time?

23:36.957 --> 23:38.166
You fight for it.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.918
Are there refs out there?

23:40.001 --> 23:42.170
No, they're on their own.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.381
- But how--
- It can't get any more objective.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.091
Even Barnes isn't judging this one.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.719
Winning is everything, plain and simple.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.639
Take ten minutes, stretch.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.349
Use the restroom.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.767
Call your mothers.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.352
When you get back,

23:58.728 --> 23:59.688
it's go time.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.612
All right. Great, right?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.697
Another shot.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.991
Yeah, real great.

24:11.074 --> 24:15.537
Kenny's faster, Demetri's bigger,
and Hawk's more experienced.

24:15.620 --> 24:20.125
Hey, you're a natural badass. I knew it
when I first saw you on that debate stage.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.918
No one's more cutthroat than you.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.213
Do whatever you can
with whatever you got. You understand?

24:28.383 --> 24:29.468
Yes, Sensei.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.726
Whoa. Dude, are you seeing this?

24:37.809 --> 24:40.854
MIT is completely revamping
the robotics program.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.231
I mean, this is monumental. This is…

24:44.357 --> 24:47.068
Wait. Are you not signed up
for the RoboTeam email?

24:48.195 --> 24:51.490
The race for the RoboCup begins
the moment we get on campus, Eli.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.908
- We have to--
- I didn't apply.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.204
Whoa. What?

24:57.287 --> 24:59.456
Look, I'm really sorry.
I wanted to tell you sooner--

24:59.539 --> 25:00.373
Sooner?

25:00.457 --> 25:03.001
We've wanted MIT ever since we were kids,

25:03.084 --> 25:04.294
babies, practically.

25:04.377 --> 25:07.464
I just want to keep my options open.
After we went to that frat party, I--

25:07.547 --> 25:08.381
Whoa!

25:09.049 --> 25:11.134
You wanna go to school with Kyler?

25:11.218 --> 25:12.594
What? No, no. God, no.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.431
The party just made me realize
there's a whole wide world out there.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.101
And I still might apply to MIT. Later.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.770
Okay, well, you do realize

25:21.853 --> 25:25.106
that your chances go down
without Early Action, right? You get that?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.317
I don't appreciate the condescension.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.569
And I don't appreciate
you turning into a moron.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.197
At least I'm not
an overbearing control freak.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.617
Your obsession with MIT
is so freaking annoying.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.535
Annoying.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.453
I'm… Okay. All right.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.747
Well, I promise not to annoy you anymore.
How about that?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.707
- No--
- No, it's fine. It's great.

25:46.461 --> 25:47.546
Yeah!

25:48.964 --> 25:50.048
Yeah!

26:01.518 --> 26:02.435
Yeah!

26:04.062 --> 26:09.484
Yeah! Oof, oof, oof, oof!

26:19.494 --> 26:20.579
Come on!

26:22.372 --> 26:23.248
Yeah!

26:24.749 --> 26:27.877
Yeah! Let's go!

26:34.634 --> 26:35.510
Go!

27:24.184 --> 27:27.437
Yesterday… you really had to
handle Anthony like that?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.439
Kick him while he was literally down?

27:30.732 --> 27:32.442
Man, I'm sorry I was a dick.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.738
I mean, Daniel, this whole thing
has really dredged up my demons.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.660
I think I got most of it out of my system
when Johnny and I fought last night.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.453
Wait.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.081
What the hell are you talking about?

27:54.964 --> 27:56.466
Has anyone seen my laxatives?

28:01.680 --> 28:05.141
Oh!

28:12.190 --> 28:15.235
- It's gonna be hard to beat Kenny.
- Devon's got this.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.494
Holy shit. Hey, Kenny won.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.167
Oh!

28:34.713 --> 28:37.048
- No, no, no. Hey!
- I don't think he's gonna make it.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.885
Hey, open up. Open up, please.
Please, I gotta… I gotta go. Please.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.053
Please open up!

28:47.225 --> 28:48.226
Oh man.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.730
- Somebody just got their brown belt.
- Johnny!

28:54.733 --> 28:56.401
- What's that smell?
- Move!

29:00.864 --> 29:03.450
Hey, guys. It's Devon. She won.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.494
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

29:13.877 --> 29:15.086
Where's Kenny?

29:22.719 --> 29:23.845
You chose my path?

29:23.928 --> 29:26.181
I didn't know
you were gonna go down this path.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.224
Maybe if we had coordinated earlier.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.351
Oh, wait. That wouldn't have mattered,
would it?

29:30.435 --> 29:33.146
Great. Now we're not going
to Barcelona together either.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.147
Okay.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.749
How do you like it, huh?

30:01.257 --> 30:03.259
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to hit you that hard.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.554
It's fine. It's fine. I don't wanna go
to Barcelona with you anyways.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.015
Come on, D, you don't mean that.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.800
Demetri.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.816
I give you Miyagi-Do's Team Sekai Taikai.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.192
Miguel.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.071
Yeah, Miguel!

31:05.154 --> 31:05.989
Sam.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.574
Yeah!

31:08.408 --> 31:09.409
Robby.

31:10.785 --> 31:11.703
- Bam.
- Tory.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.915
- Yeah!
- And now, Devon.

31:18.793 --> 31:19.627
And Demetri.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.837
Yeah!

31:32.765 --> 31:33.683
Good luck.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.318
Sorry, bro.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.654
So looks like you're feeling better.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.282
Yeah, well, uh,
after what happened to Kenny,

31:49.365 --> 31:51.826
I mean, my bloody nose
doesn't seem that bad.

32:01.127 --> 32:01.961
Hey, um…

32:03.755 --> 32:06.716
Are you okay?
I heard about your… accident.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.509
It wasn't an accident.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.012
It was LaPusso.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.556
He put Mitch's laxatives in my water.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.478
Why would he do that?

32:18.561 --> 32:20.396
He's still butt-hurt
that I knocked him out.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.024
Are you gonna tell the senseis?

32:25.318 --> 32:27.028
His dad would never believe me anyway.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.076
I'm sorry, Kenny.

32:46.965 --> 32:47.840
Hey.

32:48.841 --> 32:49.717
You did it.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.845
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.806
My ride's here.

32:55.890 --> 32:56.808
See you later.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.232
- Feeling good, Johnny?
- Hell yeah.

33:04.732 --> 33:06.234
Even with the collateral damage?

33:08.319 --> 33:10.154
You and I both know Hawk should be going.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.116
I heard about your fight with Barnes.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.620
You just had to Eagle Fang your way
to what you wanted, huh?

33:17.704 --> 33:19.455
You expect me to just sit back?

33:20.081 --> 33:24.002
Even with the Miyagi-Do patch on my back,
I'm gonna fight for people I care about.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.628
Look where that's gotten us.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.215
Do you honestly believe
we have our strongest team?

33:29.966 --> 33:33.011
- I think they can handle anything.
- Let's hope you're right.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.430
Because we have no idea
what we're up against.
