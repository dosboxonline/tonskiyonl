00:45.253 --> 00:47.255
[intriguing music continues]

00:57.682 --> 00:59.059
[Silver] Sensei Kim Da-Eun.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.354
Welcome to the Valley.
How was your flight?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.773
Last minute.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.817
Is Sensei Kreese not with you?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.445
I'm afraid John Kreese
is no longer with Cobra Kai.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.322
He had some legal troubles.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.282
That is disappointing to hear.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.245
You asked me to bring
the best senseis my dojang had to offer.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.622
I have done so.

01:22.665 --> 01:26.669
You must be exhausted from your trip.
There are refreshments in the limo.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.755
[intriguing music continues]

01:33.343 --> 01:35.136
Limousines and private planes.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.265
This sort of extravagance
might impress your former shareholders,

01:39.891 --> 01:41.851
but it does not hold sway for me.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.937
[intriguing music continues]

01:46.523 --> 01:47.607
That attitude

01:49.150 --> 01:52.779
is exactly why I wanted you
to teach at my dojos.

01:52.862 --> 01:57.200
I need you to see which of my students
are ready to take the next step.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.913
I'm offering you full autonomy
to test my students your way.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.251
Just one of the many perks you'll have
as my business partner in Cobra Kai.

02:06.835 --> 02:11.297
Your offer is very tempting,
but I did not get on the plane for money.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.513
50% is just a number.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.974
What I'm offering you

02:21.724 --> 02:22.892
is legacy.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.856
Your grandfather didn't teach
American soldiers the Way of the Fist

02:27.939 --> 02:29.732
just to use on the battlefield.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.361
We have to share his style with the world.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.283
And you think your American students
are up to the task?

02:38.867 --> 02:39.784
I do.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.371
We shall see.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.082
[intriguing music swells]

02:58.511 --> 02:59.637
[music fades]

02:59.721 --> 03:03.558
-It's been a week. The longer we wait--
-We must let Daniel-san heal.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.604
Chozen's right. I wanna do something too,
but we can't just go after Silver--

03:07.687 --> 03:08.855
Dad.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.193
Johnny? What are you doing here?

03:13.943 --> 03:16.613
Figuring out how to make Silver pay
for what he did to you.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.281
[Amanda] What's with the suit?

03:18.781 --> 03:21.409
[sighs] I can't wear my pajamas
to LaRusso Auto, can I?

03:21.492 --> 03:22.952
You're going into work?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.495
[Chozen] We need to make plans--

03:24.579 --> 03:27.373
Guys, I appreciate the sentiment. I do.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.336
But I'm out of this thing with Silver.
If he wants the Valley, he can have it.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.341
-I'm done with karate.
-What do you mean you're done with karate?

03:36.424 --> 03:37.926
Must not give up.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.677
I am giving up.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.347
Trying to go toe-to-toe with Silver
was a mistake.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.849
It almost cost me my family.
I'm not making that mistake again.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.142
Daniel, we're with you.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.269
You don't have to stop fighting.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.437
Yes. I do.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.317
I became a sensei to help kids.
Instead, I'm making everyone's life worse.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.277
What are you talking about?
You did help kids.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.030
Want me to make list of how many ways
they're hurting because of this,

03:59.113 --> 04:00.114
including my daughter?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.533
Ask Robby how much I've helped him.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.827
[Johnny sighs]

04:06.496 --> 04:10.667
You know, growing up, I never understood
why Mr. Miyagi walked away from a fight.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.502
But I understand now.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.965
It's not our job
to fight the monsters of the world.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.133
Not anymore.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.972
[melancholy music plays]

04:26.557 --> 04:27.558
[door buzzes]

04:28.142 --> 04:30.561
Kreese, your granddaughter's here.

04:33.898 --> 04:34.816
Hi, Grandpa.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.526
Hi, granddaughter.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.866
How'd our little sting pan out?

04:45.576 --> 04:46.953
Not the way we hoped.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.038
Sensei Silver didn't even bat an eye.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.499
He's just been focused
on expanding the dojos.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.709
[Kreese] That's unfortunate.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.003
Is there something else?

04:56.879 --> 04:57.714
Yeah.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.303
Mr. LaRusso got really hurt.
Because of us.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.139
Well, that's one enemy gone.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.768
[chuckles] When I get out of here,
I'll take care of the other.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.353
You don't care about what happened?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
-He was a means to an end.
-Is that what I am?

05:15.273 --> 05:19.277
Of course not. You and I are the only ones
who can trust each other.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.115
How much longer
do I have to stay at the dojo?

05:25.283 --> 05:28.369
I know how difficult it is
to be behind enemy lines.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.122
But I need you there for a little longer.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.081
[door buzzes]

05:34.000 --> 05:35.835
I got a plan to get out of this place.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.628
-You do?
-[Kreese] Yeah.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.049
I'm gonna play the good soldier,
which is what I need you to do.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.345
So do whatever Silver says,
but keep your eyes and your ears open.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.138
[tense music plays]

05:47.221 --> 05:48.222
Now he's smart,

05:49.307 --> 05:50.350
but he'll slip.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.895
And that'll be the opening that we need.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.105
Can you handle that?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.066
[tense music continues]

05:58.149 --> 05:59.067
Yes, Sensei.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.695
Good.

06:08.743 --> 06:09.660
[boy groans]

06:09.744 --> 06:11.621
Please, I didn't hit you that hard.

06:13.039 --> 06:17.293
That was a fabulous kick, Devon.
But remember, we're all friends here.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.005
-So watch that aggression. Okay?
-[Silver] I thought she fought perfectly.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.176
Terry, so good to see you.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.930
Class, gather round, please.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.558
[grunting]

06:32.642 --> 06:33.851
[referee] Point! Winner!

06:33.935 --> 06:35.728
[dramatic music crescendos]

06:35.812 --> 06:39.941
I have a bittersweet announcement to make.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.987
Sensei Terry Silver has made me
a very generous offer,

06:45.071 --> 06:46.489
and I'm proud to say

06:46.572 --> 06:49.992
Topanga Karate is now
under new management.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.829
We're thrilled
to be part of the Cobra Kai family.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.831
Thank you, Sensei Rosenthal.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.999
[tense music plays]

06:57.083 --> 07:00.545
I'm sure you're wondering what this means
for the future of your dojo.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.298
Yes, there will be some changes.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.551
All for the better.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.012
I hope you don't mind
your dues getting cheaper.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.599
You'll be given a new sensei.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.726
For today,

07:16.727 --> 07:19.439
Sensei Kim and Sensei Hyan-woo.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.983
You're replacing me, Terry?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.570
This wasn't the deal
we made at Shabbat services.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.822
[tense music continues]

07:30.074 --> 07:31.409
Topanga Karate

07:32.452 --> 07:37.373
has spent the last few years
taking losses left and right.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.626
That ends today.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.171
My new senseis

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
will be molding you all into winners,

07:46.090 --> 07:50.261
just like our own All Valley
Tournament Champion, Tory Nichols.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.597
If you wanna be taught
by the best of the best,

07:53.764 --> 07:56.267
step up and take a gi from Sensei Odell.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.603
If you wanna quit,

08:00.229 --> 08:04.275
then at least take a complimentary thermos
from Sensei Bacaria,

08:04.358 --> 08:05.568
as my gift to you.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.195
[tense music speeds up]

08:11.949 --> 08:16.954
Well, looks like
your students made their decision.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.581
Shalom, Sensei.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.460
-Class is yours. Nichols, you're with me.
-[Kim] No.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.505
Your champion stays here.

08:27.089 --> 08:27.924
What for?

08:28.633 --> 08:31.302
I need to see
who the best fighters are in this dojo.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.972
You will help me test them.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.265
[tense music plays]

08:43.272 --> 08:44.148
Yes, Sensei.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.485
-[tense music fades]
-I don't get it.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.863
"No be there" is one thing,
but LaRusso letting Silver win?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.199
That walking oil spill
got into Daniel's head

08:53.282 --> 08:55.159
in a way I didn't think was possible.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.787
He'll come around. He just needs time.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.874
Do not have much time.
Silver's empire growing every day.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.378
Sure, but, I mean,
the Valley only has so many kids.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.255
How many new dojos can he open?

09:07.922 --> 09:11.842
He's not just opening new ones.
He's taking over other dojos now too.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.719
I'm here at Topanga Karate,

09:14.637 --> 09:17.014
welcoming them into our Cobra Kai family.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.392
-When did this happen?
-It's live. It's happening now.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.103
Perfect. I'm gonna go down there
and beat his ponytail ass.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.105
You can't march there like a one-man army.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.066
The hell I can't. Guy's whole MO
is hiding in the dark,

09:27.149 --> 09:28.651
waiting for us to fall into his traps.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.613
Right now, we know where he is.
He's not on his home turf.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.908
-Chozen, please say something to him.
-Amanda-san is right.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.161
-One-man army not good.
-Thank you.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.330
-I come with you.
-That's not what I meant.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.291
You know this isn't some kata competition?

09:43.374 --> 09:44.417
Hai.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.836
Is that a yes?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.212
[Chozen sighs]

09:51.549 --> 09:53.801
I don't understand
how this is gonna help Dad.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.553
I don't know, Sam.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.598
At this point, I'm not sure what will.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.820
[suspenseful music plays]

10:20.494 --> 10:21.412
[wolf whistle]

10:22.288 --> 10:23.164
Hey, Sensei.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.709
Oh, wow. Look at you feeding yourself.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.920
I guess the nurse that changes your diaper
has the day off.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.256
[laughter]

10:33.257 --> 10:36.010
-Yeah.
-I love the red ones. Mmm.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.803
You know what?

10:38.638 --> 10:42.016
From here on out, these are my Jell-Os.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.685
What do you think about that, old man?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.771
[tense music plays]

10:51.359 --> 10:53.110
I think that's a fine idea.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.737
[laughter]

10:55.696 --> 10:56.572
[man] Thought so.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.700
See you around, Sensei.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.078
[laughter]

11:03.204 --> 11:05.331
[Kreese] One thing
that really surprised me

11:05.414 --> 11:08.459
was how easy it was
to get along with all the other men.

11:09.752 --> 11:14.173
Is that so? I didn't realize
you were making friends in here.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.509
Yeah, well, I make friends pretty easily.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.804
I find that a little kindness
goes a long way.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.683
Mmm. I'm happy to hear
that you're doing well with the others.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.976
Not all prisoners your age
have the same experience.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.896
They're usually easy targets.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.898
Well, I'm made of stronger stuff.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.902
You could throw me right through a window
and I wouldn't even get a scratch.

11:34.985 --> 11:35.820
[chuckles]

11:36.320 --> 11:38.197
Emotionally speaking, of course.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.365
Of course.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.283
Oh.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.619
Looks like our time is up.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.289
-Oh, we were just getting into a groove.
-[chuckles]

11:47.790 --> 11:48.624
Well…

11:50.418 --> 11:53.129
Thanks, Doc.
I really enjoy our time together.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.171
Me too.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.759
You're not just sweet-talking me
to get a good recommendation, are you?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.511
Oh, of course not.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.141
I just find these sessions
so very helpful.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.104
Pair up.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.315
Show me knife strike,
palm strike, back fist.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.109
Five up, five down.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.235
[in Korean] Begin.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.696
[dramatic drumbeat]

12:21.824 --> 12:22.825
[dramatic drumbeat]

12:25.578 --> 12:27.163
[Devon grunts]

12:28.289 --> 12:30.583
[in English] Keep walking. [grunts]

12:31.375 --> 12:32.209
[Devon grunts]

12:32.293 --> 12:35.129
Fine. But you'll break your hand
if you hit someone like that.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.422
I know what I'm doing.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.757
[grunts]

12:39.216 --> 12:40.301
Then hit me.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.141
Wrong.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
[dramatic drumbeat]

12:52.354 --> 12:54.440
Keep the side of your hand sharp,
like a knife.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.571
Better. Not by much.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.368
Why are you in that gi? Don't think
you have what it takes to join Cobra Kai?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.872
I'm still deciding whether your dojo
has what it takes to earn me.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.416
Guess you forgot
who kicked your ass at the tournament.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.043
Please. That ref was blind.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.378
He gave you a point
when I was out of bounds.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.172
-Why are you here?
-My mom always said…

13:23.344 --> 13:25.554
"The only way you really lose
is by giving up."

13:25.638 --> 13:26.555
Sounds smart.

13:28.974 --> 13:29.809
She was.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.561
I'm sorry.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.356
For what? You didn't do anything.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.901
I'd love to kick cancer's ass though.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.321
Yeah.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.157
I know how you feel.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.450
[tense music plays]

13:47.284 --> 13:50.788
But you have to take all that anger
and put it into your fist.

[Kim in Korean] Stop!

14:02.132 --> 14:03.551
[in English] I have seen enough.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.512
You have used your strength
to train each other.

14:07.221 --> 14:11.183
Now you will use your strength
against each other.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.312
Nichols, get them ready.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.775
You didn't have to come.
I can handle this.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.986
Not likely. Silver very dangerous.

14:22.069 --> 14:22.987
Yeah, I know.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.365
I'm ready for him. I can be dangerous too.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.451
[chuckles] Daniel-san told me
how dangerous you can be.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.288
Did he mention
how I kicked his ass back in high school?

14:33.372 --> 14:38.085
-I robbed him while he was on date.
-Oh yeah? I pushed him down a cliff.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.796
-I fight him to death.
-Oh yeah? What, are you a ghost?

14:40.880 --> 14:44.133
No, Daniel-san showed me mercy.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.676
Yeah, sounds like LaRusso.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.221
-Man, he was such a twerp back then.
-Real pain in ass.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.558
But he always fight for what he believe.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.228
He never backed down from a fight,
even when he should have.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.356
A few months ago,
I saw him take on an entire hockey team.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.900
Five on one. He beat 'em all.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.404
I saw him save young girl from typhoon.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.322
[Johnny sighs]

15:07.114 --> 15:09.783
He took a man down with a single strike
to his pressure point.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.329
Who do you think teach him that?

15:15.831 --> 15:16.916
We're here.

-What are you doing?
-One of my students is in there.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.809
Not here for student. Here for Silver.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.645
Must wait for right time.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.441
Run into den of lions, you will get eaten.

Fine, we'll wait.

Doc!

16:24.400 --> 16:27.569
I… I just got a letter from the…
From the warden.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.864
I think something went wrong
with your recommendation.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.117
Really? It felt accurate to me.

16:33.784 --> 16:38.831
Yeah, but you're recommending
against my petition for early release.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.334
Why? [chuckles] I thought
we were making great strides.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.128
John, cut the crap.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.798
-Excuse me?
-You think this is my first day?

16:47.881 --> 16:48.882
I know the difference

16:48.966 --> 16:51.135
between a breakthrough
and saying what I wanna hear.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.055
I had no other option.

16:56.473 --> 17:00.102
The court assigned me some bullshit
attorney who was in over his head.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.437
If you want to get out early,

17:01.520 --> 17:04.565
you really need to think
about why you're here in the first place.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.193
I'm free all tomorrow morning
if you'd like to chat.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.404
That should be plenty of time
for us to dig deep.

[Kim] Back in Korea,
our students would climb Chiri-san,

the tallest mountain on the mainland,

17:23.709 --> 17:26.587
with heavy packs
filled with nothing but water.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.881
We would train at the peak

17:28.964 --> 17:32.551
long after the sun has set
and the night's turned cold.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.636
I would train among them,

17:35.220 --> 17:37.139
wearing two heavy packs.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.476
My students are determined.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.605
I will see how determined you are.

You two, up.

[suspenseful music plays]

The Way of the Fist means
you do not hold back. You do not go easy.

Or is this what it means in America
to be a champion?

Then act like one.

I believe that deep down
you're a good man.

Whatever it took to save yourself.

Don't judge me

It was war.

Oh, but that violence followed you home.

I read your file.

After Vietnam, you became a sensei,

opened a dojo, taught kids how to fight.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.796
I taught them to be strong.

"Take the anger they feel."

Do you feel angry, John? At who?

None of it is my fault.

Regret?

am I supposed to feel regret for?

What? I'm not Daniel LaRusso.
I look nothing like him.

Miss Lee, why don't you go
check in with the receptionist.

She'll set you up with a pass

Oh. I definitely will.

to learn more from you.

The test was not for her. It was for you.

how much strength you had in your heart

And what's that?

26:29.045 --> 26:31.840
All have trained
under Silver's master, Kim Sun-Yung.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.635
I defeated six senseis
from Valley by myself.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.389
It took two of us
to stand against just one.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.683
Still think we could have taken 'em.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.727
Give me nunchucks, and it's lights out.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.729
Okay, let's just take a breath here

26:45.812 --> 26:48.732
before we start entertaining
assault with deadly weapons.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.734
Chozen, you're still new around here,

26:50.817 --> 26:54.446
and no offense, Johnny,
but strategy isn't exactly your forte.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.532
-You're more of a… blunt instrument.
-Thank you.

26:58.533 --> 27:02.120
If we're gonna mount a resistance,
we're gonna need Daniel to lead it.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.456
You heard him.
He doesn't wanna fight anymore.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.335
I thought I was done fighting too.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.171
But I was wrong.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.881
I thought the same as Dad.

27:13.506 --> 27:17.093
I felt like… karate just made
everything worse for everyone.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.929
I've even got the scars to prove it.

27:21.723 --> 27:25.226
But years from now,
if my scars have faded…

27:27.854 --> 27:29.230
the lessons that I learned,

27:30.398 --> 27:31.941
Mr. Miyagi's lessons,

27:33.902 --> 27:36.404
they'll be more powerful
than the first time I put on a gi.

27:38.698 --> 27:42.160
Dad was right. Mr. Miyagi
avoided a fight whenever possible.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.205
But he also fought when he had to.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.832
And if he were here right now,

27:49.084 --> 27:53.129
I think he would tell Dad that
this is a fight we can't walk away from.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.423
[hopeful music plays]

27:56.675 --> 28:00.303
Well, Daniel may not have Mr. Miyagi
to rely on anymore,

28:00.387 --> 28:02.722
but… he's got us.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.808
[hopeful music continues]

28:07.644 --> 28:08.853
[door buzzes]

28:08.937 --> 28:11.439
[intercom] Cell Block C,
proceed to the commissary.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.525
[man] Lunchtime, boys.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.984
[wolf whistles]

28:15.068 --> 28:16.069
Hey, Sensei!

28:16.986 --> 28:19.114
I'm here for my Jell-O cup today.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.408
[ominous music plays]

28:23.410 --> 28:26.162
What's the matter?
Ears full of shit, old man?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.707
Let me clean them out for ya.

28:28.790 --> 28:29.708
[Kreese groans]

28:30.417 --> 28:33.044
How is this bag of bones
in here for assault?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.587
[laughs]

28:35.171 --> 28:37.173
[ominous music intensifies]

28:40.260 --> 28:41.845
You don't know me very well.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.930
[dramatic music plays]

28:47.475 --> 28:49.144
[prisoner groans]

28:53.314 --> 28:54.524
[prisoner] Come on!

28:56.151 --> 28:58.653
-[Kreese grunts]
-[dramatic music continues]

29:05.827 --> 29:09.247
[yells]

29:10.290 --> 29:11.374
[man] Sensei!

29:12.000 --> 29:12.959
Keep going!

29:13.042 --> 29:14.586
[crowd shouts]

29:15.462 --> 29:18.423
[crowd] Sensei! Sensei! Sensei!

29:18.506 --> 29:19.883
Sensei! Sensei!

29:19.966 --> 29:21.593
Yeah!

29:21.676 --> 29:26.681
[crowd] Sensei! Sensei!
Sensei! Sensei! Sensei!

29:27.307 --> 29:30.143
From now on,
you're gonna give me your Jell-O.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.647
-You got a problem with that?
-No. No.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.566
No, what?

29:36.649 --> 29:38.067
No, Sensei.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.110
[tense music plays]

29:42.447 --> 29:43.531
[man thuds on ground]

29:45.033 --> 29:47.035
[tense music fades]

29:49.829 --> 29:52.165
What are we doing here?
I thought we were heading home.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.959
Uh, we just have to make a quick stop.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.336
Come on.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.381
[sighs]

30:00.465 --> 30:02.467
[gentle music plays]

30:10.350 --> 30:12.519
Amanda, I don't go in there.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.563
Hey. It's okay.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.398
You're hurting right now.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.567
But I want you to heal.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.319
And I'm right here.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.739
[Daniel sighs]

30:24.823 --> 30:26.282
[gentle music continues]

30:28.159 --> 30:29.160
[Daniel exhales]

30:30.578 --> 30:32.539
[gentle music continues]

31:01.442 --> 31:03.444
[gentle music continues]

31:26.259 --> 31:28.052
It's like a time capsule in here.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.138
[gentle music continues]

31:32.891 --> 31:34.601
The night before we got married,

31:35.268 --> 31:36.394
I was so nervous.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.438
I came here to see Mr. Miyagi.

31:39.689 --> 31:43.943
He sat me down,
poured me a cup of tea… and some sake.

31:44.027 --> 31:44.861
[chuckles]

31:45.862 --> 31:47.113
And we talked about you.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.991
He loved you so much, Daniel.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.369
He said to me, "Amanda-san,

31:54.829 --> 31:58.166
in life, always easier
to hide head in sand."

31:59.876 --> 32:03.171
He told me you could be
a bit of a handful sometimes.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.674
That you would always fight
for what you believed in.

32:07.425 --> 32:11.304
And there was nothing you believed in
more than your family and friends.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.264
[sighs]

32:13.348 --> 32:15.350
[Amanda] And what I believe in now

32:15.433 --> 32:17.226
is standing up to Terry Silver.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.105
It's the right thing to do for you,

32:21.189 --> 32:22.857
for me, for our family.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.444
Sorry it took me so long to realize.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.529
[gentle music continues]

32:29.405 --> 32:31.157
That means the world to me, Amanda.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.746
But what if standing up to Silver
just makes things worse again?

32:37.413 --> 32:40.124
Every time I try
to fight for what's right,

32:40.208 --> 32:41.376
somebody gets hurt.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.546
I can't fail these kids again.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.548
[Robby] You didn't fail me.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.764
Sam and my dad told me what was going on.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.310
You know, when you first met me,
I was a messed-up kid.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.437
But you gave me a job.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.107
And a home.

33:06.150 --> 33:06.985
And a purpose.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.029
You can't just give up.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.741
[Daniel] Robby, the things I did,

33:14.367 --> 33:15.284
juvie, I was…

33:16.119 --> 33:18.871
-I was just trying to help you.
-No, I'm… I'm sorry.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.292
I should've listened to you
about Cobra Kai.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.674
But I didn't understand
until I started mentoring someone myself.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.719
Now Silver's got a hold on this kid.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.349
There's some others in there
I care about too, and, uh,

33:40.351 --> 33:41.894
we need to stop Cobra Kai.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.105
But we can't do it without you.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.399
Sensei.

33:46.941 --> 33:47.817
[chuckles]

33:48.317 --> 33:50.820
Dad, not everyone has someone like you

33:50.903 --> 33:53.156
to protect them and teach them.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.201
It's time that all of us join this fight.

33:59.078 --> 33:59.912
All of us?

34:03.124 --> 34:05.126
[uplifting music plays]

34:14.260 --> 34:15.720
[Sam] You're not alone anymore.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.805
So what do you say, Dad?

34:18.639 --> 34:19.766
Will you fight?

34:19.849 --> 34:21.851
[uplifting music continues]

34:35.615 --> 34:37.617
[uplifting music swells]

35:07.271 --> 35:10.233
