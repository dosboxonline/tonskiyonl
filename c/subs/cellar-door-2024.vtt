WEBVTT

00:40.308 --> 00:42.076
The one on the left
is Endless Sun.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.745
-  Mm-hmm.
- It contains grains of sand
from the beaches of Mauritius.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.914
That's what gives it
that, like, nice texture.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.449
- Okay.
- Then the one on the right,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.551
that one's Parisian Gold.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.586
The pigment comes
from a gilding house in France

00:52.586 --> 00:54.255
that supplied
the Palace of Versailles

00:54.255 --> 00:55.656
with cornicing
for the Hall of Mirrors.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.091
- Really?
- I know. I know, yes.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.692
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.628
Hmm.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.930
Is that a hard "no"
on Tahitian Vanilla?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.932
- Yes, because that's
an ice cream flavor.
- Okay.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.501
- No. Baby, this is
our baby's room.
- Okay.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.170
I want it to be perfect.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.871
I know you do.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.440
I'm just gonna say
it'd be easier

01:12.440 --> 01:14.375
if we knew if it was gonna be
a boy or a girl.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.144
And we'll know in a few months.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.512
- Besides, I'm not refusing
to find out.
- Yeah?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
- Just that I can live
with not knowing.
- Hmm.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.683
The fact that you can't is...

01:23.151 --> 01:24.718
Ah, it's so much fun.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.521
- Yeah, I'm getting
that whole vibe over here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.790
What do you think?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.058
Um...

01:31.058 --> 01:32.560
Parisian Gold.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.363
- Oh, I think I like
the Parisian Gold.
- Oh, good.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.365
- Me too.
- Settled.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.373
Oh.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.940
You're next.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.446
You've been pretty incredible
through this whole thing.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.650
With all the doctors
and all the injections

01:56.650 --> 01:58.886
and all that craziness,
you've been amazing.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.391
Well, I didn't do it alone.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.194
No, I did it alone. A couple.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.962
Yep, all by myself.

02:11.765 --> 02:12.766
You ready?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.638
Yeah, I am. I'm ready.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.441
I mean, I'm terrified,
but I'm ready.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.744
You love me.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.447
You love me too.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.857
<i>Logic and statistical
reasoning appear to live</i>

02:36.857 --> 02:41.562
<i>somewhere between exact science
and the infinite unknown.</i>

02:41.562 --> 02:43.797
But nothing could be further
from the truth.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.135
It's really no different
from any other mathematical
field of study.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.303
- And in this way...
- Yep.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.340
<i>There's only one answer.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:55.075
- Okay.
- Guys, check it out.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.114
You know, she and John
used to be a thing.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.850
-  Dude.
- Seriously?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.052
- It was a long time ago.
I'm happily married now.
-  Mm.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.420
Everybody believes you.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.822
- Would you shut up, man?
-  <i>There's no gray area.</i>

03:08.822 --> 03:11.292
You can't agree to disagree.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.563
It's as binary as one and zero.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.131
Hey.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.000
Hey.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.902
You're showing
the Scarsdale house today, right?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.704
Yeah.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.873
You mind if I tag along?

03:27.908 --> 03:30.611
Come on. It's the last project
we worked on together.

03:31.945 --> 03:32.913
Oh.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.115
I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.258
Oh, fuck. John, John,
please pick up, please.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.728
All right, guys.
Appreciate it. Nice to see you.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.795
<i>Hi, you've reached John Winter.</i>

04:21.795 --> 04:23.063
<i>Please leave me a message.</i>

04:26.567 --> 04:28.869
Oh!

04:30.871 --> 04:32.906
<i>Hi, you've reached John Winter.</i>

04:32.906 --> 04:36.109
Oh, fuck, please.
Come on, John.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.067
-  Hey.
- Mm.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.201
Come here.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.777
You love me.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.719
You love me too.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.983
I can't stay here.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.755
I know.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.588
Listen, the right thing's
gonna come along,

08:40.588 --> 08:41.955
and when it does, we'll know it.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.157
It's been over a month.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.594
A-and everything's
either completely
out of our price range

08:46.594 --> 08:47.861
or it's a teardown.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.363
I promise we're gonna find
the perfect house,

08:50.363 --> 08:52.900
- and we're gonna live
the life of our dreams.
- Yeah?

08:52.900 --> 08:56.303
Perhaps you'd be willing
to expand your search area?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.672
Or I could pull a few listings
from the next town over.

08:58.672 --> 09:02.542
No, no. This-this feels right.
This-this feels like home.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.245
Guys, to be honest,
I've sort of run out of options.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.481
But you seem like you really,
really need to live here,

09:08.481 --> 09:11.685
so I'm gonna recommend
you speak to a friend of mine.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.421
<i>Been in this town
for a long time.</i>

09:14.421 --> 09:15.889
<i>He knows everybody,</i>

09:15.889 --> 09:19.026
<i>and he knows
every single piece of property.</i>

09:20.493 --> 09:22.162
<i>If there's anybody
who can help you find</i>

09:22.162 --> 09:24.832
<i>the home you're looking for,
it's him.</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:28.035
Look at this.
It's like the beginning

09:28.035 --> 09:29.302
- of a horror movie.
-  Tsk.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.939
Hey, honey, I got a great idea.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.707
Let's go visit the dude
we don't know

09:33.707 --> 09:35.976
with the big, scary house
out in the middle of nowhere.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.911
What could possibly go wrong?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.780
You know what? At this point,
we're so desperate,

09:39.780 --> 09:40.881
I'll take all the help
we can get.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.382
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Mm-hmm.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.252
Holy shit.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.754
Wow.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.171
Welcome.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.506
I'm so glad you decided to come.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.075
I'm Emmett. Emmett Claymore.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.542
- Yeah, John.
- John.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.944
This is my wife, Sera.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.245
- Sera, lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.714
- Thank you for having us.
- Oh, of course.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.615
Please, let's get you inside.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.158
All right, here we are.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.094
You don't really see
Jacobethan Revival like this

10:27.094 --> 10:28.261
too much anymore.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.830
Well, well, well.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.464
A man who knows
his architecture.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.100
Yeah.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.468
So when was it built?
Early '20s?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.603
1918.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.008
When I first took possession,
she was in sore need of repair.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.543
I spent the better part
of a decade renovating her,

10:43.543 --> 10:46.947
but finally managed
to get her restored.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.283
Oh, it's perfect.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.587
- It is kind of cool, isn't it?
-  It is.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.525
So, Jeannie tells me you guys

10:58.525 --> 11:00.360
are looking to buy in
our neck of the woods?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.530
Uh, yes. "Looking-looking" being
the operative word there, yes.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.599
We really, really love it here,
but we keep striking out.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.936
Doesn't surprise me.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.138
Real estate around here
is tricky business.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.573
Most of the homes,
they get passed down
generationally.

11:13.573 --> 11:17.310
So, you're-you're what?
You're sort of an inside man?
Is that it?

11:17.310 --> 11:18.712
- Something like that.
- Got it.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.280
- Okay.
- No, I have a talent

11:20.280 --> 11:22.315
for pairing the right property
with the right people.

11:23.016 --> 11:27.320
And to do that,
I try to get to know
the people that I'm helping.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.488
Right.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.690
I just recently got my hands
on a '98 Margaux,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.860
and I'd hate to drink it alone.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.864
Okay, might I convince you
to stay for an early dinner?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.267
I thought maybe we could mix
a little business with pleasure.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.671
Yes, yes, we'd love to.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.907
- Terrific.
-  Yes.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.675
The dining room's right in here.

11:55.082 --> 11:58.786
<i>So, an architect
and a mathematician.</i>

11:58.786 --> 12:01.221
- A seeker...
- Yes.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.190
- ...and a solver.
-  Mm-hmm.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.258
Infinite possibilities
on one hand.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.228
A single solution on the other.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.697
What I'd like to know
is how you two work that out.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.767
Well, I'll put it to you
this way.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.668
-  Mm-hmm.
- I'm an impossible
know-it-all...

12:15.668 --> 12:17.570
-  Ah.
- ...and this one here
is always right.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.940
You know,
between the two of us,

12:19.940 --> 12:22.442
- we work it out.
- Got it.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.678
So, why move
all the way out here?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.647
I mean, you're young.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.118
I would assume the city
would have more appeal for you.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.423
Well, we're leaving
one story behind.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.191
We're here to write a new one.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.229
Hmm.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.831
Well, then...

12:43.831 --> 12:46.499
...here's to this next chapter
in all our lives.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.937
-  Cheers. Cheers.
-  Cheers.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.171
Cheers.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.980
What's, uh, what's all this?

13:00.780 --> 13:04.417
When they originally laid
the foundation for the house,

13:04.417 --> 13:07.855
- the workers unearthed
numerous old artifacts.
-  Huh.

13:07.855 --> 13:12.659
Mining tools,
old military weapons,
what have you.

13:12.659 --> 13:17.264
It was all stored in a shed
behind the house
until I moved in.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.533
Once the renovations began,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.136
I myself discovered

13:23.937 --> 13:26.439
numerous other remnants
that had been hidden away

13:26.439 --> 13:28.976
in the chimneys and the walls.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.078
What are we talking about here?
A suitcase full of money?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.547
- Nothing that exciting.
- No? That's too bad.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.584
But I just couldn't bring myself
to throw any of it away,

13:37.584 --> 13:41.221
so I turned it
into this showcase.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.159
I like to think of it
as a living record of the house

13:46.159 --> 13:48.295
and its rich history.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.864
- It's really cool.
-  Yeah.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.734
That's what we're looking for,
you know,
a house with character.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.604
Ah, you know what they say
about old houses.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.272
They're like people.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.877
They all have
their deep, dark secrets.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.078
Mm.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.482
So can I please have
a standing playdate
with this house?

14:09.482 --> 14:12.886
Well, I don't know.
It depends. I mean...

14:12.886 --> 14:14.587
Well, what if the house
were yours?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.057
Should we make an offer?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.092
Yeah, I got, like,
27 bucks on me.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.593
Well, he'd be crazy
not to take it.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.562
- He would be crazy--
- I would, but let's forget

14:22.562 --> 14:26.499
the financial facts for a moment
and just for the sake
of argument...

14:26.499 --> 14:28.201
Yeah?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.203
...what if this house
were yours?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.306
I-I'm sorry, I don't follow.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.010
You just said you were looking
to start a new chapter.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.111
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.314
So, my question is,

14:42.916 --> 14:45.285
can a house make you happy?

14:45.285 --> 14:49.556
Can this house make you happy?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.029
No, no.

14:57.230 --> 15:01.634
It's not the house
that makes you happy.
It's the-- it's the home.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.869
Hmm.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.680
How about you?
Has this house made you happy?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.717
It did. Once.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.454
"It did once"?
What-what happened?
What changed?

15:25.158 --> 15:30.830
I guess my home
has become just a house.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.402
Just a house.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.808
Maybe it'll be different
for the two of you.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.581
You've been incredibly generous,
but we should really get going.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.317
- Yeah.
- What kind of a host would I be

15:50.317 --> 15:52.885
if I didn't let my guests
stay here

15:52.885 --> 15:54.354
after a night of revelry, hm?

15:54.354 --> 15:57.224
-  Well--
- Oh, please, listen.

15:57.224 --> 16:01.428
You must stay. The guest rooms
are already made upstairs.
I insist.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.130
You really shouldn't drive.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.366
- I mean, I probably
shouldn't drive at this point.
- No, you shouldn't.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.401
It's settled.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.403
I'm gonna close up down here.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.505
You two have a restful sleep,

16:12.505 --> 16:14.941
and we continue talking
in the morning

16:14.941 --> 16:19.279
because I think I may know
the perfect house for you guys.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.090
Think about it.
Think about it, okay? Like...

16:31.058 --> 16:34.427
- Oh, having breakfast
in the gazebo.
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.797
- Throwing amazing parties.
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.333
Watching our kids play
in the yard.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.170
- Eh, I mean, maybe a little.
- Shut up.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.573
Do you think
he can really help?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.810
Yeah, maybe he can.

16:53.813 --> 16:54.914
What?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.550
I missed you.

17:41.928 --> 17:42.995
Do you hear that?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.636
Yeah, I don't know.
I think he might have left.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.807
I don't know.

17:54.807 --> 17:55.808
Emmett?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.852
Emmett, we're taking off.
We just want to say goodbye.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.659
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.001
"Dear John and Sera..."

18:22.001 --> 18:25.405
<i>It has been a pleasure
meeting you both,</i>

18:25.405 --> 18:27.640
<i>and in the short time
we spent together,</i>

18:27.640 --> 18:30.042
<i>we've shared
a meaningful connection.</i>

18:30.042 --> 18:34.181
<i>You're a lovely couple
with long, happy lives
ahead of you.</i>

18:34.181 --> 18:37.750
<i>In getting to know you,
it's clear you seek change,</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:40.620
<i>a new beginning,
and I'd like to help.</i>

18:40.620 --> 18:44.191
<i>This house represents a past
I wish to leave behind.</i>

18:44.191 --> 18:48.561
My wife used to sit
on that patio every evening,

18:49.762 --> 18:51.998
just to watch the sun go down.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.834
<i>Since I no longer want it,</i>

18:54.834 --> 18:58.638
<i>I'd like to give the house
and everything in it to you.</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:05.378
<i>I do, however,
have one simple condition.</i>

19:05.378 --> 19:08.114
<i>You must never open
the cellar door.</i>

19:12.852 --> 19:16.556
<i>If you observe that condition,
the house is yours to keep.</i>

19:18.758 --> 19:20.627
<i>If you break the contract,
however,</i>

19:20.627 --> 19:23.463
<i>the house returns to me
immediately.</i>

19:25.398 --> 19:27.367
<i>I'm sure this is
but a small price to pay</i>

19:27.367 --> 19:29.168
<i>for the chapter
you wish to write.</i>

19:30.370 --> 19:32.071
<i>The decision is yours.</i>

19:33.640 --> 19:35.875
"Sincerely, Emmett."

19:50.757 --> 19:52.292
I just, I-I don't understand.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.061
What could be so unimportant,
you just would leave it behind,

19:55.061 --> 19:57.530
but so important,
you wouldn't want us to see it?

19:57.530 --> 19:58.665
Who cares?

19:58.665 --> 20:00.833
- Who cares?
- Yeah, who cares?

20:00.833 --> 20:05.405
This-- Look at this place.
This-this could be ours
for nothing.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.039
Sera, it's not nothing.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.741
- I don't see the big deal.
-  Yoo-hoo!

20:08.741 --> 20:10.009
Morning, neighbors.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.211
Oh, you guys hit the jackpot
or what?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.881
Jeannie, wha-wha--
what is this? Is this a joke?
What's going on?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.649
No, no, no,
it's not a joke at all.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.519
I handle all of Mr. Claymore's
real estate affairs.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.488
I'm here
to collect the paperwork.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.189
- Did you sign?
- No, not yet.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.557
We're discussing it.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.859
- We're discussing this,
actually.
- Oh, well...

20:28.127 --> 20:31.197
- We can handle that.
- Good, because that
is a nonstarter.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.233
- Got it. Can I talk to you
for a second, please?
- Yes.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.204
<i>Oh, come on,
you-you were the one that said</i>

20:38.204 --> 20:40.507
that when the perfect thing
came along, that we would know.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.509
Oh, this is not
what I was talking about.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.943
Sera, come on.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.879
Aren't you just
even a little bit creeped out?

20:46.879 --> 20:49.449
I mean, ask yourself, why?
Why would he give it away?

20:49.449 --> 20:52.285
Let's think about this
logically for a-a second, okay?

20:52.285 --> 20:55.021
If we buy a cheap house
just so we can get out
of our apartment,

20:55.021 --> 20:56.656
we're gonna have to renovate
that house.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.425
That's gonna take, what,
like a year, 18 months?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.127
And then there's
the-the-- the permits
and the construction.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.629
And then where are we?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.465
And then there's this.

21:06.633 --> 21:11.037
We're just in.
We're done.
There's-there's no stress.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.410
Baby, we-we sank
all of our savings into IVF.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.112
If we have any hope
of trying again.

21:21.848 --> 21:26.586
I slept for the first time
in weeks. So did you.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.087
Yeah, I did, but...

21:29.556 --> 21:32.325
it is just--
It doesn't make any sense.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.029
It's always gonna be you and me,
whatever we decide. Together.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.768
But, baby, we can heal here.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.978
- All right, thank you so much.
- You are gonna be
so very happy here.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.246
You are gonna be
happy here. Yes.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.848
<i>And if there's anything
at all you need, call me.</i>

21:55.848 --> 21:56.949
<i>Yes,
I have your number.</i>

21:58.818 --> 22:00.186
Thank you.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.221
-  <i>Emailed, yes.</i>
-  <i>All right.</i>

22:02.221 --> 22:04.056
- Thank you. Oh, good luck
with everything.
- Oh, okay, Jeannie, bye.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.893
- Oh, golly. Good luck. Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.762
This place is ours.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.531
This is ours!

22:13.165 --> 22:16.002
-  Oh, boy...
- Oh, my God.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.075
Oh, my God.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.341
Hmm...

22:56.743 --> 22:59.746
Hey.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.515
Oh, those don't go in here.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.916
- These don't go in here?
- Uh-uh.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.052
They go in the office.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.620
Oh, is that why
they say "office" on them?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.288
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.205
-  So happy
you guys are here.
- The house is great.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.574
-  Oh, thank you. Yeah.
-  Thank you.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.975
Well, if you need a refill,
um, booze is over there.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.543
-  Oh, perfect. Awesome.
- Yes.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.078
-  All right,
see you in a bit.
-  See ya.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.079
-  Yeah, yeah.
- Are you kidding me?

25:13.079 --> 25:14.246
This place is incredible.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.882
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, it's pretty great.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.383
- Uh, you remember
my wife, Sera?
-  Hi.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.118
- Yeah, of course.
- Hi. Good to see you.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.021
Hey, I'm sorry we're late. Uh...

25:22.021 --> 25:23.255
-  Hi.
- Hi.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.425
Hi, I'm Alyssa.
I work with John.

25:26.425 --> 25:30.763
Yes. Sera. Yes, I think
we met at a company party.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.565
I got you a housewarming gift.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.166
It's jasmine. It's my favorite.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.236
Oh, that's very sweet of you.
Thank you.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.440
You guys,
please go grab some drinks.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.409
- After you.
- Mm.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.446
Here, hold it.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.450
- Hey.
-  Hi.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.885
What are you doing here?

25:52.885 --> 25:54.086
Well, Zac invited me.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.155
What was I supposed to do,
turn him down?

25:56.155 --> 25:58.257
Uh, yeah, well...

25:58.257 --> 26:01.027
Well, you told me
I should move on, so...

26:02.995 --> 26:05.865
Besides, I wanted to see you.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.467
I heard about what happened
and I was worried.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.370
I'm okay. I'm okay.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.439
Okay.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.375
Well, you know I'm here for you.

26:17.509 --> 26:18.778
For whatever you might need.

26:19.712 --> 26:23.415
You just have to understand,
the last time,
it was the last time.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.953
And what I need is for you
to leave me alone, okay?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.257
John?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.225
- John?
- Yeah?

26:33.225 --> 26:34.894
You need to come outside
right now.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.737
What's going on?

26:47.473 --> 26:49.175
Who is this?

26:51.678 --> 26:53.079
I-I think
we should call the police.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.513
No, no, no, I got it.

26:58.718 --> 26:59.952
Can I help you, man?

27:01.187 --> 27:03.555
Hey, buddy.
What's going on? You lost?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.093
What's going on?

27:12.899 --> 27:14.100
I'm sorry.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.336
It's okay, it's okay.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.542
You gotta burn it down
before it's too late.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.145
What?

27:27.379 --> 27:30.182
You gotta burn it down
before it's too late.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.985
It's not worth the price.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.620
It will destroy you.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.544
All right, show's over, folks.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.947
Did anyone call the police?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.627
Oh, hey.

28:15.627 --> 28:16.863
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.630
Good morning.

28:18.630 --> 28:19.932
You must be the new neighbor.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.200
- Yes.
- Kathryn Conrad.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.935
- Hi, Sera Winter.
- Nice to meet you.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.003
We're right over there.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.371
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.006
I've been meaning to come by
and say hi in person,

28:27.006 --> 28:29.708
but my husband said
I should let you guys
settle in first.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.344
You both have to come over
for drinks.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.513
- Yeah, yeah, we'd love to.
- Yeah? Okay, great.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.648
- I'm gonna reach out
with some times.
- Okay.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.217
Oh, God, you seem so nice.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.886
I hope you guys stick around.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.087
Yeah.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.857
Hey. Morning.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.442
Hey, John.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.243
Yeah?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.113
HR's waiting for you
in the other conference room.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.048
Great, thank you.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.918
<i>Sexual harassment?
Are you serious?</i>

29:11.918 --> 29:13.552
Goddamn it.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.388
I cannot believe
I'm gonna lose my job over this.

29:16.388 --> 29:19.158
Look, hey, it's just
a temporary suspension, okay?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.226
Just until they complete
their little investigation.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.327
Are you kidding me?

29:21.327 --> 29:22.795
We both know how this goes.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.864
- It's her word against mine.
- I know, I know. I--

29:24.864 --> 29:28.067
I mean, if I'm such a threat,
why is she coming to my house?

29:28.868 --> 29:30.569
Why?

29:30.569 --> 29:33.505
That's all well and true,
but you got a bigger problem.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.308
What are you gonna tell Sera?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.576
- How you doing?
- Good.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.777
What's all this?

30:11.777 --> 30:13.445
I'm going back to work.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.547
You're going back to work?

30:15.547 --> 30:17.383
Wow, that's amazing.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.051
Yeah, it is,
and it's a good thing too,

30:19.051 --> 30:21.353
because if I had to spend
another day
whiling away the hours

30:21.353 --> 30:23.489
in this empty house,
I might kill one of us.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.124
Most likely you.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.328
What about you?
How was your day?

30:32.564 --> 30:35.301
Yeah, it was-it was good.
You know, it was good.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.237
Good.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.561
<i>There's no way I could do it.</i>

31:02.561 --> 31:04.897
<i>Are you kidding me?
For all this?</i>

31:04.897 --> 31:06.332
<i>I wouldn't even question it.</i>

31:06.332 --> 31:09.168
Old man give you a clue
what might be down there?

31:09.168 --> 31:11.137
No, no clue,
but it's probably nothing.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.572
So why can't you look?
It's gotta be something.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.874
- If it's nothing,
why can't you open it?
- Exactly.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.677
'Cause we've just--
We've put it out of our minds.

31:18.677 --> 31:23.149
Look, I've got
a great, new house,
I have an amazing wife.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.551
Life is good. Life is good.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.454
- I don't need to look.
-  I don't believe you.

31:28.454 --> 31:29.688
I think you wanna look.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.459
I think you can't help yourself.

31:55.847 --> 31:57.416
Oh, God, I have to go.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.685
- I'm super late.
- Oh.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.853
-  Love you.
Have a good day at work.
- Love you.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.356
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.309
<i>You still haven't told her?</i>

32:23.309 --> 32:26.112
It's been two weeks, man.
<i>Oh, you don't understand.</i>

32:26.112 --> 32:28.747
She's just so happy
for the first time
in so long. I...

32:30.082 --> 32:31.883
I can't do it.
I just can't do it.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.753
The longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.423
<i>I just know,
if I could talk to her,</i>

32:37.423 --> 32:39.325
I know I could work
this whole thing out. I know it.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.926
<i>Who, Alyssa?</i>

32:40.926 --> 32:43.295
Are you out
of your fucking mind?
You can't talk to her.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.831
Hell, I shouldn't even be
talking to you.

32:45.831 --> 32:46.832
<i>Dude,</i>

32:47.699 --> 32:49.801
<i>we all know the truth, okay?</i>

32:49.801 --> 32:53.339
Yeah, the truth is,
is I'm fucked. That's the truth.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.974
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.484
Ah!

34:12.484 --> 34:15.721
Fuck!

34:15.721 --> 34:16.888
Goddammit.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.427
I was thinking
we could start painting

34:21.427 --> 34:23.061
the upstairs rooms this weekend.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.330
What do you think?

34:24.330 --> 34:25.664
Maybe paint the nursery.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.633
It's a way to manifest
getting pregnant.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.570
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

34:32.671 --> 34:33.639
Sure.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.774
What?

34:35.774 --> 34:38.310
- John, I know you. What is it?
- What?

34:38.310 --> 34:42.581
You've been trying
to tell me something
since you got home, so spill.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.857
How would he know?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.692
How would who know?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.594
Emmett, how would he know?

34:56.695 --> 34:58.197
That's what this is about?

34:58.997 --> 35:02.768
There's got to be something
down there, Sera.
Think about it.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.603
How would he even know
if we looked?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.938
You only want to look because
you're being asked not to.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.441
No, I wanna know
why we're being asked not to.

35:09.441 --> 35:14.112
Because it's the one condition
on which we get to keep
this house.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.847
- And we agreed to it.
- Pfft.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.517
- We can't not discuss it, Sera.
- You don't wanna discuss it,
my love.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.652
You just want me
to agree with you, and I don't.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.988
So we just ignore it?
Is that it?

35:36.001 --> 35:38.470
<i>A butterfly emerges
from its cocoon,</i>

35:38.470 --> 35:40.071
flaps its wings,

35:40.739 --> 35:43.475
and the wind shear
inadvertently sets off a tornado

35:43.475 --> 35:46.345
<i>a thousand miles away.</i>

35:46.345 --> 35:47.779
It's called
the "butterfly effect."

35:48.447 --> 35:51.650
<i>It's a small,
seemingly insignificant
initial condition</i>

35:51.650 --> 35:55.821
<i>which drastically affects
the trajectory of a system.</i>

36:03.429 --> 36:05.163
<i>Hi, it's Alyssa.
Leave a message.</i>

36:06.432 --> 36:07.733
Hey, it's me.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.469
Call me back. We need to talk.

36:10.469 --> 36:14.506
It's also one of the foundations
of our next subject,
chaos theory.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.444
<i>Which attempts
to explain how complex</i>

36:18.444 --> 36:20.246
<i>and seemingly unpredictable
systems</i>

36:20.246 --> 36:24.182
<i>have behaviors that can,
in principle, be predicted.</i>

36:32.424 --> 36:37.596
Because there's always,
always a constant
beneath the chaos.

36:41.933 --> 36:42.901
Here you go.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.171
2424 Cookson Road.

36:46.171 --> 36:50.008
Wow. I really-- I can't believe
you had a set on hand.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.377
Thank you so much.

36:51.377 --> 36:54.212
Well, the prior owner, um...

36:55.447 --> 36:58.016
Paul MacManus,
requested a copy last year.

36:58.016 --> 37:01.086
Called him a bunch of times,
but...

37:01.086 --> 37:02.388
...he never picked it up.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.555
I'm-I'm sorry, Paul MacManus?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.223
I thought
Emmett Claymore lived there.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.727
I haven't heard that name
in a long time. Not since...

37:09.995 --> 37:13.231
- What?
- Must be 25 years ago now.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.302
Had a happy marriage
as far as anyone could tell.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.436
But then his wife...

37:18.537 --> 37:22.173
up and left him. Took their
five-year-old daughter
with her too.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.675
Do you know what happened?

37:23.675 --> 37:27.078
No idea. Ran off
in the middle of the night.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.880
Never saw them again.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.084
Strange business for sure.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.321
Hmm.

37:35.321 --> 37:39.391
Okay. Thank you so much
for your help. I appreciate it.

37:39.391 --> 37:43.395
I know
that this seems theoretical.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.130
Maybe even impenetrable.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.932
I mean,
it's definitely overwhelming.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.073
Knew it.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.076
<i>So let me-let me break it down</i>

37:58.076 --> 38:02.581
<i>into something
a little more relatable,
digestible.</i>

38:02.581 --> 38:04.583
<i>Finite means a set of numbers</i>

38:04.583 --> 38:07.853
<i>where only the start
or the ending is given.</i>

38:07.853 --> 38:10.221
Sort of like life, right?

38:18.464 --> 38:22.167
<i>It's up to you to decide
how you start...</i>

38:22.167 --> 38:24.235
<i>...or how you finish
something.</i>

38:25.303 --> 38:28.874
<i>And then your choices take you
towards that finite value.</i>

38:28.874 --> 38:31.543
<i>And finding
that value in life...</i>

38:32.878 --> 38:35.080
...well, that's entirely
up to you.

38:37.549 --> 38:41.587
Happiness, fulfillment, contentment.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.690
All you have to do
is make the right choice.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.866
But we're gonna have to wait
for that for next week.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.002
So, please, in the meantime,
read chapter two

38:57.002 --> 39:01.306
and email me with any questions,
as always.

40:34.399 --> 40:35.366
John?

40:36.468 --> 40:37.435
John?

40:38.303 --> 40:39.705
Yeah, in here.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.273
- Hey.
- You're home early.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.343
Yeah. Uh, I had
an inspection finish early,

40:45.343 --> 40:47.679
so I got out of there.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.315
- Nice surprise.
- Yeah.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.850
Hi.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.552
Hey, can you help me
with the rest of the stuff
that's in the car?

40:53.552 --> 40:55.020
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.610
Hey.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.011
<i>What do you want?</i>

41:20.612 --> 41:22.380
We need to talk.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.949
So, talk.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.684
No, no, no, not like this.
In person.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.586
<i>I don't think
that's a good idea.</i>

41:27.586 --> 41:29.955
You're a threat to me, remember?

41:29.955 --> 41:32.390
Alyssa, give me
a chance here, okay?

41:32.390 --> 41:33.959
Please? Let me talk to you.

41:35.527 --> 41:36.795
Fine.

41:37.529 --> 41:40.065
Tomorrow, two o'clock.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.199
Where?

41:41.199 --> 41:42.534
You know where.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.670
<i>Our favorite place to park.</i>

42:20.972 --> 42:22.641
What are we doing here?

42:22.641 --> 42:24.209
You tell me. You wanted to meet.

42:24.209 --> 42:27.245
No, no, no,
you know what I mean.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.447
I mean, what are we doing here?
Wha-what?

42:29.447 --> 42:33.284
Well, I-- I just--
I don't understand. Why?

42:33.284 --> 42:36.087
- Why?
- Yeah, why are you doing this
to me?

42:37.355 --> 42:39.024
Because you're a fucking liar,
John.

42:39.024 --> 42:42.127
I know that I hurt you.
I know that I did. I know it.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.929
And I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

42:43.929 --> 42:46.131
But you can't go around
making up stuff about me

42:46.131 --> 42:47.999
that we both know isn't true.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.701
You just can't do that.

42:49.701 --> 42:51.603
We wanted the same thing.

42:52.838 --> 42:53.939
A life together.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.506
- The house, the kids.
- Yeah.

42:55.506 --> 42:56.842
Like we talked about.

42:56.842 --> 42:58.476
Why can't you just admit
that you're unhappy,

42:58.476 --> 43:02.247
and that is why
you make your way back to me
every single time?

43:02.247 --> 43:03.248
Alyssa.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.586
No one makes me feel
the way you do. No one.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.522
What we have is undeniable.
There's no question.

43:12.691 --> 43:14.059
But I love my wife.

43:14.059 --> 43:17.663
I love her.
And that's never gonna change.

43:17.663 --> 43:19.030
You gotta understand that.

43:19.030 --> 43:20.365
You love me too.

43:21.132 --> 43:22.768
You told me you did.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.671
And we fit together, John.
You know we do.

43:25.671 --> 43:27.372
We know each other's secrets.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.407
You're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life
if you don't chance.

43:29.407 --> 43:32.911
I need you to hear me.
I need you to hear me
right now, okay?

43:32.911 --> 43:35.847
I'm never gonna leave Sera
for you. Ever.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.248
It's not gonna happen.

43:37.248 --> 43:39.384
Get it through your head.
It ain't gonna happen.

43:39.384 --> 43:41.219
Was I supposed to get it
through my head

43:41.219 --> 43:44.589
when you were fucking me
behind her back over and over?

43:44.589 --> 43:47.525
Goddamn it.
Will you shut the fuck up?
This is my life here.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.327
This is my fucking life too.

43:51.730 --> 43:52.998
And it's Sera's life.

43:54.599 --> 43:57.135
And I'm gonna make sure
she knows who you really are.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.871
If you go anywhere near my wife,
I will fucking kill you.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.073
Do you understand me?
I will fucking kill you.

44:04.209 --> 44:06.177
Get your hands off me.

44:54.592 --> 44:57.528
Hey, I'm gonna go hit the trails
over in Millbrook.

45:00.265 --> 45:02.633
Why don't you tell me
the real reason you're going?

45:03.735 --> 45:04.702
What's that?

45:08.273 --> 45:10.208
You're trying to skip out
on taping duty.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.211
You caught me.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.113
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.313
That motherfucker.

48:30.208 --> 48:31.609
Oh, shoot.

48:47.092 --> 48:48.259
Hello?

48:54.832 --> 48:55.800
Sera?

50:16.614 --> 50:18.616
Oh, what the hell, John?

51:43.100 --> 51:46.471
What the hell is wrong with you?
All you had to do
was just stay away.

51:46.471 --> 51:47.772
<i>Yeah, I know I messed up.</i>

51:47.772 --> 51:49.574
<i>I messed up.
I thought I could fix it.</i>

51:49.574 --> 51:52.377
Just ever since we moved
into the house,
everything has gone to shit.

51:52.377 --> 51:54.745
Listen to me.
You only have one option.

51:55.313 --> 51:56.347
Let it play out.

52:03.321 --> 52:04.522
John? You still there?

52:04.522 --> 52:06.724
She just left my house.

52:06.724 --> 52:08.693
- <i>Who?</i>
- Alyssa. She just left
my fucking house.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.361
<i>Don't do something stupid.</i>

52:11.429 --> 52:12.963
<i>Hello? John?</i>

52:12.963 --> 52:14.031
<i>John?</i>

52:30.615 --> 52:32.883
Come on, come on, come on.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.046
Where were you?

53:37.715 --> 53:39.550
I was running. I told you.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.752
For four hours?

53:43.321 --> 53:45.823
What's wrong?

53:56.367 --> 53:57.668
I'm pregnant.

54:02.072 --> 54:03.040
Are you serious?

54:04.542 --> 54:06.076
Oh, my God.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.752
There's something else.

54:23.661 --> 54:26.497
- I didn't go in the cellar.
- No, but you tried.

54:27.965 --> 54:30.935
Yeah, I did. I did.
That-that was stupid. I'm sorry.

54:31.769 --> 54:35.873
We made a promise
to each other, John. Right?

54:37.875 --> 54:39.944
Look, I need to know
that we're in this together.

54:41.379 --> 54:42.813
That I can trust you.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.282
It's not just us anymore.

55:38.703 --> 55:40.671
Okay. So, on the left,

55:40.671 --> 55:44.041
there's more of like a deeper,
sagey green.

55:44.041 --> 55:47.111
And then on the right,
it's-it's like minty.
It's lighter.

55:48.245 --> 55:49.246
Which one do you prefer?

55:50.214 --> 55:53.418
Oh. Uh...

55:53.418 --> 55:55.085
Uh, no, I like them both. Um...

55:55.085 --> 55:57.522
- Okay.
- Probably the one on the right.

55:57.522 --> 55:58.823
Yes! Okay, good.

55:58.823 --> 56:01.459
- Um, so, crib over here.
- Yeah.

56:01.459 --> 56:03.594
- Yeah.
- And then changing table,

56:03.594 --> 56:05.563
rocking chair right there.

56:05.563 --> 56:07.031
-  Mm-hmm.
- What?

56:08.365 --> 56:09.500
What?

56:09.500 --> 56:12.236
Uh, I don't know.

56:12.236 --> 56:15.440
This-this feels a bit early.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.974
- Is it too early for all this?
- No.

56:16.974 --> 56:20.077
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

56:21.145 --> 56:23.881
I love you for worrying,
but it's all good.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.349
I'm stronger than I look.

56:27.485 --> 56:28.719
We're gonna be good.

56:30.488 --> 56:31.822
Okay.

56:34.191 --> 56:35.159
Work.

56:39.196 --> 56:40.297
Yeah? This is John.

56:40.297 --> 56:41.699
<i>Yes, it's Mrs. Taylor from HR.</i>

56:41.699 --> 56:43.534
- Yeah?
- <i>I wanted to inform you,</i>

56:43.534 --> 56:45.870
<i>you've been cleared
in the investigation.</i>

56:45.870 --> 56:47.472
- Are you serious?
- <i>Yes.</i>

56:47.472 --> 56:48.973
- <i>Are you able
to start on Monday?</i>
-  Okay.

56:48.973 --> 56:50.975
- Yes, absolutely, yes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

56:50.975 --> 56:52.977
Of course. Thank you. Um...

56:53.711 --> 56:54.979
I'll see you Monday.

56:56.481 --> 56:57.648
Okay.

57:02.853 --> 57:04.021
Sorry about that.

57:04.589 --> 57:05.956
- All okay?
- Yeah, all good.

57:05.956 --> 57:08.726
Just some drama at work,
but all good now.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.060
Oh, okay.

57:10.060 --> 57:12.963
- Um, will you hold this
on that side?
- Sure.

57:13.631 --> 57:14.932
Thank you.

57:18.503 --> 57:22.072
- Hey, hey. Welcome back,
my man.
-  Thank you.

57:22.072 --> 57:23.107
There he is.

57:23.107 --> 57:24.441
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.744
Listen, what'd I tell you?
Trust the process.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.779
I don't know.
I still don't really believe it.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.948
Yeah, well, apparently,

57:30.948 --> 57:33.884
Alyssa's infatuation with you
was an open secret.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.153
No one bought her sob story.

57:37.187 --> 57:38.823
Have you-have you seen her yet?

57:38.823 --> 57:40.024
- No.
- No?

57:40.024 --> 57:42.527
- No, she was out all last week.
- Right.

57:42.527 --> 57:44.995
- "Self-care," they say.
- Right.

57:44.995 --> 57:46.897
I know HR tried to reach her
over the weekend,

57:46.897 --> 57:49.199
but she's-she's ducking
their calls.

57:49.199 --> 57:51.769
I'm guessing she caught wind
of their decision.

57:51.769 --> 57:53.604
But you know who is back?

57:53.604 --> 57:55.405
- You, rock star.
- Me.

57:55.405 --> 57:56.941
- Lunch is on me.
- Okay.

57:56.941 --> 57:58.576
Okay? And we can pretend
all this bullshit
never happened.

57:58.576 --> 58:01.646
- Please.
- All right. Until then,
get back to work.

58:01.646 --> 58:02.947
- Okay.
- All right.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.187
<i>You think
Emmett's gonna care
if we toss his painting?</i>

58:10.187 --> 58:12.356
Uh, remove the painting, please.

58:12.890 --> 58:14.058
Okay.

58:18.462 --> 58:19.429
What?

58:20.097 --> 58:21.398
What the hell is that?

58:22.633 --> 58:24.134
Mmm.

58:36.346 --> 58:37.381
What is it?

58:46.791 --> 58:47.958
Jesus.

58:50.494 --> 58:52.630
- You're overreacting.
- I'm overreacting?

58:52.630 --> 58:55.600
- Yes.
- We just found a bullet hole
in our wall.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.367
Why would we not call
the police?

58:57.367 --> 58:59.904
Because there's probably
a rational explanation

58:59.904 --> 59:02.740
that doesn't require
you going nuclear, John.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.174
Seriously.

59:05.676 --> 59:07.712
Hear me out, okay?
Just hear me out.

59:07.712 --> 59:10.514
I have heard
that Emmett's wife and daughter,

59:10.514 --> 59:11.849
they left him 25 years ago.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.184
No one has seen them since.
No one.

59:14.184 --> 59:15.720
That doesn't strike you as odd?

59:15.720 --> 59:18.088
So you think
that he murdered them

59:18.088 --> 59:20.090
and they're buried
in our basement?

59:21.558 --> 59:22.993
Yes, I think it's possible.

59:22.993 --> 59:26.196
Well, don't you think the police
would have investigated?

59:26.196 --> 59:29.066
- I don't know.
- You-you've gotta drop this.

59:29.066 --> 59:30.400
You know, I'm not doing this.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.836
I'm not going down
the rabbit hole with you.

59:31.836 --> 59:33.170
This is what you do.

59:33.170 --> 59:34.438
- This is what I do?
What do I do?
- Yes.

59:34.438 --> 59:36.506
Instead of seeking
rational explanations,

59:36.506 --> 59:38.042
you-you leap to conclusions.

59:38.042 --> 59:41.178
And-and most of the time,
it's fine because I love you.

59:41.879 --> 59:43.580
But I can't do this.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.916
The next eight months
are gonna be stressful enough,
so please...

59:48.919 --> 59:50.821
Please just drop it.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.433
Okay. It's dropped.

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.036
It's dropped.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.577
Two steps forward,
one step back.
You know how it is.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.046
Yeah, that's how that goes.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.982
-  Uh, hey, Kiah.
-  Yeah.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.818
What's going on?

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:55.452
- You haven't heard?
- No.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:59.824
They found Alyssa's car
abandoned somewhere upstate.

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.992
They think
she may have committed suicide.

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.937
I fell asleep
on the ferry ride home.

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:14.972
-  No.
-  I did.

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:18.809
If it wasn't for some guy
who woke me up,
I'd probably end up in Canada.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:24.414
Okay, I've-I've been meaning
to ask you something.

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:27.852
Um, when we first met,
you-you said something.

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.987
Oh, boy. Me and my big mouth.

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:31.288
I hope I didn't say anything
too offensive.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:32.757
No, no, no. It's the opposite.

01:01:32.757 --> 01:01:36.460
You-you actually said, "I-I hope
you guys stick around."

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.429
- Oh.
- What'd you mean by that?

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:45.269
Just that we didn't wanna lose
you guys, you know,
like the others. I...

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:47.805
What do you mean?
What-what others?

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:49.239
The other families.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:51.241
You know, there's been
a handful of 'em over the years.

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.210
The MacManuses
were the last ones.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.879
Super nice couple.

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:56.947
Oh, fun, fun, fun.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:59.984
And then one day,
they were just gone.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:02.753
No goodbye. No nothing.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:05.856
- Although,
I suspected marital trouble.
- Oh.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:09.359
I did. But you two
seem happy as clams.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:13.430
And I get such a kick
running into John
on my daily runs.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.201
Oh, my God, he must love
working from home. Oh!

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:19.169
- Mm.
- I'm sorry?

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.305
We cross paths
running around lunch,

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.440
but I haven't seen him
in the last few weeks.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.209
Huh.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.715
Is everything all right?

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:42.292
Is something going on with John?

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.062
Uh, no.

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:47.431
No, no. I, uh... I'm sorry.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.400
I-I-- I didn't realize
how much John was running.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.369
Oh.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.438
- It's my yoga instructor.
- Okay.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.307
And he is so fucking hot.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:58.375
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:02:59.576
I'm gonna go namaste him.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:03.413
So good to see you here.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.077
I heard about
that girl you work with.

01:03:33.077 --> 01:03:35.112
The news said she was missing.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.514
Yeah.

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.416
Yeah, we just found out
about it today.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.586
It's terrible.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.423
Do the police know
what happened?

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.893
No, I don't think so. I mean...

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:53.430
they talked
to some people today,
and no one seems to know much.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.866
Yeah, we're hoping she's okay.

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:58.468
Yeah. I bet.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.994
It's the same bullet, Sera.
It's an exact match.

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:31.161
That doesn't worry you?

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:32.896
Uh, okay,
so it's-it's the same brand.

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:34.564
That doesn't mean
that Emmett murdered his family

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.300
or that they're buried
in the basement.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.169
Yeah, but it's pretty damn
compelling, don't you think?

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:42.939
Why would he just leave it
in plain sight?
That makes no sense.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.542
I don't know. I don't know.

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:51.715
- Let's look.
- Fine. You wanna look?

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:53.717
- Yeah, why not? Let's look.
- Why?

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.719
Because we'd lose
the house, John.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.588
We would lose everything.
Do you really want that?

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.202
Mrs. Winter?

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.405
I'm Detective Stark.
This is Detective Weiland.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:19.376
We'd like to speak
with your husband. Is he home?

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.081
Yeah. Uh, hi, I-I'm John Winter.
How can I help you?

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:26.983
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,
if you don't mind.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.386
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:31.955
Please.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:35.959
Uh...

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.296
Please.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:40.864
In here.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.679
Can I get you anything?
A coffee? Water? Tea?

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:57.581
No, ma'am, we're fine.
Thank you.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.384
If you don't mind,
we'd prefer to speak
with your husband alone.

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.688
Oh. Uh, yeah, of course.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:21.471
What's this about?

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:23.340
Looking into
a missing persons report.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.041
Do you know Alyssa Hayes?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.910
Of course.
We work at the same company.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.679
A friend reported
her missing last week.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:32.349
We found her car, but we're
still trying to locate her.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.618
We understand
Miss Hayes recently filed

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.853
a sexual harassment claim
against you.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:37.787
Yeah.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:43.993
We dated a-a while back,
and, uh, when I broke it off,

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.563
she had trouble moving on,
especially after I met Sera.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.966
Last fall,
she made a pass at me,

01:07:49.966 --> 01:07:51.968
and I turned her down.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.070
And, uh, after that, she made up
all this stuff about me.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:58.308
The company did
an investigation,
and I was-I was cleared.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:03.012
Did you have
any contact with Miss Hayes
during the investigation?

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.014
I did. I-I-- I did.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:09.486
I, uh, called her, like,
a week or two ago,
and I left a voicemail.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:12.922
What about the call
on March 18th?

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.959
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I-I don't know.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:18.128
According to Miss Hayes's
cell phone records,

01:08:18.128 --> 01:08:21.365
you spoke with her during
the morning hours of March 18th.

01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:22.599
Is that correct?

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.703
Sure, yeah. I wanted
to straighten things out.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:30.073
It was a 30-second call.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.810
I can't imagine
how much was straightened out.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.747
Yeah, that's true. We, uh,
agreed to meet in person.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.384
And did you?
Meet in person?

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:45.355
I mean, you haven't been
in the office for five weeks, correct?

01:08:45.355 --> 01:08:47.991
So you had plenty of time.

01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:49.726
Yeah.

01:08:49.726 --> 01:08:51.528
Alyssa drove up, and we-we met

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:53.597
in a nearby
underground parking garage.

01:08:53.597 --> 01:08:56.233
And this is Saturday,
March 18th?

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:57.901
That's what it says, yes.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:58.902
What time?

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:01.871
2:00 p.m.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.642
Walk us through
your conversation.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.411
No, like I said,
I just wanted to talk to her.

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:11.915
I wanted to let her know
how this was impacting my life,
my career. Uh...

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:15.452
At one point, she agreed
to drop the allegations

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:16.953
if I went back with her.

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:21.525
I-I refused, and she got
very upset, and she drove off.

01:09:21.525 --> 01:09:24.228
Was that the last time
you saw her?

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:25.429
Yes.

01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:29.799
According to phone records,
her cell pinged a tower

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:31.901
in this neighborhood
the following day.

01:09:32.869 --> 01:09:36.440
Like I said,
the last time I saw her
was when she drove off.

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:38.675
What about you?

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.710
Where were you on March 19th?

01:09:42.346 --> 01:09:43.880
I'm sorry.
Am I-am I a suspect here?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.250
-  It's a simple
question, Mr. Winter.
- Okay.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:50.520
Where were you
during the afternoon hours
of March 19th?

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.622
Here. I was here.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.559
Can anyone corroborate this?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.066
Yep. Yes.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.501
I was with him.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:09.406
We recently found out
we're pregnant,
so, um, he was home.

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:11.608
We're just finishing up
some house projects.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:15.779
Congratulations.

01:10:25.489 --> 01:10:26.690
We'll be in touch.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.507
- Sera--
- Don't.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.777
I didn't tell you
about the allegations
because they weren't true.

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:50.013
So you continued to lie

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:54.884
by pretending to go to work
for a month.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:57.354
Oh, God, yeah.
That was stupid. I'm sorry.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:01.625
Why don't you tell me
the real reason
you kept it a secret?

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:04.093
What do you mean?

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.896
Remember the company party
right after we got engaged?

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:09.366
I had to leave early.

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:14.938
When you came home,
you smelled like sex
and jasmine.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:15.805
It's jasmine.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:17.040
<i>It's my favorite.</i>

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:28.918
I chose to look the other way
because I-I really wanted
to believe

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:30.954
that you were the man
you said you were, but...

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:34.824
you're full of shit, John.

01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:40.364
Nice to see you.

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:49.072
<i>Alyssa was telling the truth.</i>

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:54.611
<i>But it wasn't
sexual harassment.</i>

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.915
<i>It was very consensual.</i>

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:04.954
You were fucking her
all this time, weren't you?

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.795
<i>And worst of all...</i>

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.566
you were fucking her
on the day we lost our baby.

01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:34.217
That's why you didn't pick up
the phone, isn't it?

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:37.954
<i>Isn't it?</i>

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:41.558
Sera, please.

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.859
I just lied to a fucking cop
for you, John.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.561
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- No?

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:47.030
Well, what did you want me
to say?
"Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry, officer.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.065
I have no idea where
my husband was that afternoon."

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:50.734
Well, you know where I was.
I was running.

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:52.201
- I told you that.
- You were running?

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.803
- Yeah, I was.
- You were running.
No, of course.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.972
Yes, you were running.
You think they'd buy that?

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:58.675
I'm trying to protect you.

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:00.376
I don't wanna have to spend
the next 20 years

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.246
explaining to this baby
why their father's in jail
for murder.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:06.850
Wait, you don't think
I had anything
to do with it, do you?

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.685
Doesn't matter
what I think, John.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.354
They think you did.

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:12.856
Ask me.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.526
- I don't wanna ask you, John.
- Ask me.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:19.228
I don't want to ask you.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:30.373
<i>One simple condition.</i>

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.910
<i>You must never open
the cellar door.</i>

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.012
<i>I think you wanna look.</i>

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:37.714
I think you can't help yourself.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.382
-  <i>How would Emmett know?</i>
-  <i>We would lose
everything.</i>

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:40.917
<i>Do you really want that?</i>

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.118
<i>There's got to be
something down there, Sera.</i>

01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.987
We're gonna find
the perfect house,

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:45.689
and we're gonna live
the life of our dreams.

01:13:45.689 --> 01:13:47.724
-  <i>Yeah?</i>
-  <i>You know what
they say about old houses.</i>

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:48.992
<i>They're like people.</i>

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.327
They all have
their deep, dark secrets.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:53.997
You gotta burn it down
before it's too late.

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:56.966
<i>It's not worth the price.
It will destroy you.</i>

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:59.569
-  <i>I'm telling you,
that house is cursed.</i>
-  <i>You only want to look</i>

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:00.737
<i>because you're being asked
not to.</i>

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:02.438
Prior owner, uh, Paul MacManus.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.908
-  Paul MacManus?
-  Paul MacManus.

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:07.644
<i>Called him a bunch of times,
but he never picked it up.</i>

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.090
It is you.

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:56.425
Can I come in?

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.667
I'm sorry.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:06.235
- I'm going through a divorce.
- It's...

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.404
It's hard to concentrate
on anything else.

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:10.840
I'm not gonna take up
too much of your time anyway.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.241
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:14.510
What do you mean?

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.284
I can't tell you
what you wanna know anyways.

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:23.519
Why?

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:30.393
You think you're ready
to listen?

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.999
Oh, I-I don't think I have
too much of a choice anymore.

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:45.241
At first...

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.813
all you see is perfection.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.918
<i>Life you always dreamed of.</i>

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:56.552
<i>Sera.</i>

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:04.193
And like you,
we took our Faustian bargain.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:08.397
Yeah.

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:11.400
Perfect life.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.172
<i>All for the low, low cost
of your soul.</i>

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:24.447
For me, living in the house
flattered my sense
of invincibility.

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:26.315
It enabled me.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.918
Taunted me.

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:31.955
"Oh, you live
in this beautiful place.

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:34.023
Surely you can handle
a drink now."

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:38.061
But I was only deceiving myself,
hiding behind the alcohol.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:41.164
Until I found myself

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:46.602
on the slippery slope
of lies and shame.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:50.940
Ending in a shattered marriage.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:00.750
You came to the house
to warn us, didn't you?

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.852
I came there

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:06.589
to burn the fucker down.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.126
So there is something
in that house.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.427
It's not the house.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.797
It's us.

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:15.799
The things we hide.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:17.166
Our secrets.

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:21.204
<i>We cover it up,
we pretend it doesn't exist,</i>

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:23.206
<i>but it's always there.</i>

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.811
But he killed them, didn't he?
Emmett.

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:30.079
His wife and his daughter.
That's what's down there.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:32.048
No, it's not about Emmett.

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:34.117
It was never about Emmett.

01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:36.085
It's the worst of us.

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.921
Then what's down there?
What's inside? What did you see?

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:39.355
That's my biggest regret.

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.157
What, opening the cellar door?

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.626
No! Not opening it.

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:45.628
You have one choice.

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:47.063
You break the contract.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:50.900
You open the door to see
the truth inside yourself.

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:55.939
It's the only way out.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:07.616
Sera!

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.620
- Sera!
-  Up here.

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:27.103
What are you doing?

01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:30.006
I'm painting the nursery,
like we planned.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.244
We can't do this anymore.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.415
Sera.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:42.218
We can't. We can't stay here.
We gotta get out.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.955
Sera, listen to me.

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:48.224
- I've been a liar.
- John.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.692
No, no, no. Hear me out.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.127
I have been a liar

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:53.129
and a shitty fucking husband,

01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:55.664
and I hope to God
one day, you can forgive me.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.665
Please.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.068
I don't care.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:01.871
I don't care, John.

01:19:01.871 --> 01:19:04.707
I'm trying to protect our life.

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:08.411
The one we deserve.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.579
The one we agreed to.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:14.317
The one we always dreamed of.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:17.153
Look at you. Look at you.

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:18.754
You're just covering it all up.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:20.957
I mean, don't you see?

01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:22.658
It doesn't matter what shade
of green you paint the nursery.

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:25.895
This house will always be
what it is. A fucking cage.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:28.231
- It ends right now.
- No.

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:31.034
John.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.974
No. No, John, stop!

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:40.376
John, please stop.
You'll ruin everything.

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.511
John, just stop.
Just listen to me.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.746
Stop!

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:46.282
Enough!
Enough! It's done!

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.853
- Enough. I'm opening
this fucking door.
- No.

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:53.789
No. Stop it, John!

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:27.390
What?

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:31.527
I couldn't let you open it,
John.

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:33.596
Sera.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.199
You know that.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:40.803
When you open a door,
you have to be prepared
for what you might find.

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:55.451
Alyssa.

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.554
What did you do?

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:01.857
She came to the house that day.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.345
Get out of my house.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:01.884
No.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.156
All of this
was supposed to be mine.

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:08.824
Get out.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:12.395
You don't deserve this.

01:22:12.395 --> 01:22:14.697
You're fucking crazy.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.667
You don't deserve this.

01:22:21.804 --> 01:22:24.207
Ah!

01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:35.318
Help me.

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:39.522
I was defending myself
and our unborn child.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:45.628
I started to call the police,
but there was too much at risk.

01:22:48.531 --> 01:22:50.766
<i>And no one I could trust.</i>

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:51.967
Help me.

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:02.711
- Please.
-  <i>Our perfect life
was at stake.</i>

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.781
Help me. Please.

01:23:05.781 --> 01:23:07.350
I knew what I had to do.

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:36.979
<i>I needed to clear my head.</i>

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.717
<i>To find a path forward.</i>

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.789
<i>I weighed my options,</i>

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.858
<i>considered the causes
and effects.</i>

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:55.698
<i>And from the chaos, clarity.</i>

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:49.585
Alyssa. She just left
my fucking house.

01:24:52.221 --> 01:24:53.722
You were driving her car.

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.630
I couldn't just leave it here.

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:09.605
<i>I managed to lose you
at the turn.</i>

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.947
Come on, come on, come on.

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:23.886
I abandoned it where
no one would find the body.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.660
<i>And then I took her phone,</i>

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.962
<i>and I uploaded
a few last pictures.</i>

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:43.539
And I emailed the firm
asking for some time off.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:46.575
"Self-care," they say.

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:51.680
<i>I got rid of my clothes.</i>

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:56.985
<i>It was all going perfectly.</i>

01:25:58.721 --> 01:26:01.123
<i>Until somehow, I missed.</i>

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.292
<i>One bullet.</i>

01:26:03.292 --> 01:26:05.461
- What the hell is that?
-  <i>Right through
the painting.</i>

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:07.396
<i>It was easy
to predict your reaction.</i>

01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:09.298
<i>There is a bullet
in our wall.</i>

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:12.301
<i>Because there's probably
a rational explanation.</i>

01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:14.337
Please, drop it.

01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:15.404
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

01:26:15.404 --> 01:26:16.639
No!

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:17.873
<i>You just couldn't
leave it alone.</i>

01:26:30.253 --> 01:26:31.454
So, now, you know the truth.

01:26:40.162 --> 01:26:42.731
We're gonna get you
a really good lawyer.

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:50.072
Hey, John.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.515
Don't be stupid.

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:01.484
You don't get it, do you?

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:05.854
If you make that call,
you'll be going to jail
for murder, not me.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.090
Sit.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.261
Sit!

01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:21.970
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:27:27.376 --> 01:27:29.545
You're not seeing
the full picture.

01:27:30.313 --> 01:27:32.781
You lured her to our house,

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:36.785
you murdered her,

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:38.754
<i>and then you hid her body
under the stairs.</i>

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:41.757
<i>You even nailed it shut
so that no one would find her.</i>

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:52.200
I had no idea until the police
started snooping around.

01:27:58.674 --> 01:28:00.743
And then I found
that phone of hers you kept.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.649
And I put the pieces together.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:10.819
I realized
you killed that poor girl.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.658
When I confronted you,
you attacked me,

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:17.926
and I was forced
to do the unthinkable.

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:22.465
I shot my husband
in self-defense.

01:28:25.734 --> 01:28:28.571
When the police arrive,
they find me hysterical.

01:28:29.372 --> 01:28:30.573
I tell them everything I know.

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:32.675
I lead them to Alyssa's body.
"It's...

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:36.011
a terrible tragedy,"
they all say.

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:40.115
And then I raise our baby

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:44.186
in the house
we always dreamed of by myself.

01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:49.558
Or you say nothing.

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:52.528
Nobody's the wiser.

01:28:53.228 --> 01:28:57.800
We stay in this home,
our baby on the way,
our promise kept.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:07.910
What about Alyssa?

01:29:09.912 --> 01:29:12.247
A tragic disappearance.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.950
Most likely suicide.

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.055
Whatever the case,
we'll weather the storm.

01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:23.859
We'll survive this together.

01:29:25.628 --> 01:29:27.195
Or I'll survive it alone.

01:29:30.566 --> 01:29:32.668
There's only one answer, John.

01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:34.737
But the choice is yours.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.741
What's it gonna be?

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:11.640
Oh, my God,
look at this. It's so cute.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.942
St-- A little baby.
Are we dying? I'm...

01:30:13.942 --> 01:30:16.411
You know, old friend,
I'm proud of you.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:17.546
You had a hell of a year.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.315
But you-you came through
to the other side.

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:22.951
- Oh, pictures.
We haven't done pictures.
- Oh, yes!

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.653
Everybody up, everybody up.

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:26.088
By the way, you ever, uh,

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:27.890
you ever find out
what was in the cellar?

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:31.627
Oh, yeah, that's where
all the bodies are buried.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.331
Hey, everybody,
let's get pictures.

01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:38.333
Everybody in. Come on.

01:30:41.504 --> 01:30:42.771
- Sera, I almost forgot.
- Yeah?

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:44.540
Some guy dropped off
a gift for you.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.308
- It's on the piano. Mm.
- Oh, thank you.

01:30:49.845 --> 01:30:51.079
Why are you being
such a sourpuss?

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:52.748
I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

01:30:52.748 --> 01:30:54.182
Smile, okay?

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.718
- Yeah, I'm happy.
- Cheer up.

01:30:55.718 --> 01:30:57.620
Baby, there's something here
for us.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.788
And if we could have
all the attractive people
up front, please,

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.223
that would be great.

01:31:01.223 --> 01:31:02.157
Here we go, lining up.

01:31:02.157 --> 01:31:04.392
Oh, my God, look at this group.

01:31:13.602 --> 01:31:14.837
"Dear John and Sera..."

01:31:15.904 --> 01:31:18.106
<i>Congratulations to you both.</i>

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:21.844
<i>I hope this wonderful news
helps to realize</i>

01:31:21.844 --> 01:31:23.445
<i>the ideal life
you were seeking.</i>

01:31:24.713 --> 01:31:25.881
<i>By starting a family,</i>

01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.850
<i>you have transformed this house</i>

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:30.118
<i>back into a home again.</i>

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:31.887
<i>For this,
I am eternally grateful.</i>

01:31:32.655 --> 01:31:36.759
<i>I understand you both faced
many challenges
to make this happen.</i>

01:31:36.759 --> 01:31:39.562
<i>I trust it's all been worth it.</i>

01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:42.731
<i>My gift to you is the key
to the cellar door.</i>

01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:47.469
<i>Whether you choose to use it
is entirely up to you.</i>

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:50.773
<i>But I believe you already know
what's inside.</i>

01:31:50.773 --> 01:31:52.307
<i>Wishing you both the best</i>

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:55.544
<i>as you continue to write
new chapters in your life.</i>

01:31:55.544 --> 01:31:58.180
<i>Sincerely, Emmett.</i>

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:02.851
Oh, you two,
get in here for photos.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.253
Oh, my God.
I know what they were doing.

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:07.856
Okay, get in the photo.

01:32:09.725 --> 01:32:11.393
Perfect.

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:12.561
That looks great.

01:32:12.561 --> 01:32:14.496
Okay, here we go.

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:15.931
And...

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:17.900
happy, happy.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.368
Big smiles. Cheese!

01:32:21.637 --> 01:32:25.173
I'm dying. I'm dying. Okay.

01:32:26.909 --> 01:32:28.210
Yes, yes, yes, okay.

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.746
Everybody in, everybody in.
