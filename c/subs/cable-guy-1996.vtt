00:22.826 --> 00:27.414
You looked at Ray and said,
"l want him to be my boyfriend, -

00:27.581 --> 00:31.793
- but he's got to change. "
What are you talking about?

00:31.960 --> 00:36.048
One of the things
that initiated a misunderstanding -

00:36.214 --> 00:40.302
- was that one day,
l didn't want to have sex with him.

00:40.469 --> 00:44.931
So he starts talking about
calling somebody else to do it.

00:50.646 --> 00:53.940
Stop at $4,000!

00:54.107 --> 00:58.403
You'd been drinking, and you thought
you were making love to me.

01:02.866 --> 01:06.662
This differs from a normal massage.

01:14.753 --> 01:18.006
- Jamie, l ...
- No!

01:20.842 --> 01:25.931
This television funny-man
killed his brother in cold blood.

01:26.098 --> 01:29.851
My guests have crushes
on food service workers.

01:30.018 --> 01:34.314
Mr. Davis, do you take
cream and sugar in your eye?

01:41.947 --> 01:44.950
Do you want to tell them something?

01:45.117 --> 01:48.870
l'm really a man.

01:58.046 --> 02:02.384
Where's the cable guy?

02:12.394 --> 02:15.314
Rick Legatos, please.

02:19.234 --> 02:23.989
- Hey Rick, phone.
- How's the move going?

02:24.156 --> 02:30.078
The cable guy is missing in action.
l hope he gets here before l die.

02:30.245 --> 02:35.292
- You haven't called Robin?
- No. l'm giving her her space.

02:35.459 --> 02:40.380
- l can't believe she's doing this.
- You shouldn't have proposed.

02:40.547 --> 02:44.676
All she had to do was say no.
She didn't have to kick me out.

02:44.843 --> 02:49.139
- Let's go!
- Just give me a minute!

02:49.306 --> 02:52.476
Listen, a piece of advice ...

02:52.643 --> 02:58.523
Slip the cable guy $50, he'll give
you all the movie channels for free.

02:58.690 --> 03:03.737
l'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no?

03:03.904 --> 03:06.948
None of them say no.

03:07.115 --> 03:11.161
- l've got to go. Talk to you later.
- All right.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.754
Hi, this is Robin Harris.
Steven doesn't live here anymore ...

03:42.317 --> 03:46.947
- Cable guy!
- Oh, great!

03:48.240 --> 03:52.536
- Cable guy!
- Don't leave!

03:56.164 --> 03:59.376
- Wait!
- Cable guy!

03:59.543 --> 04:03.839
- l'm coming!
- Cable guy!

04:06.675 --> 04:08.427
Cable guy!

04:08.427 --> 04:09.386
Cable guy!

04:12.973 --> 04:17.101
Wait! Come back.

04:18.603 --> 04:23.358
- Look who decided to show.
- You should have come hours ago.

04:23.525 --> 04:28.447
Should l?
So, l'm the tardy one?

04:28.613 --> 04:33.160
Yeah. l was going to the
bed-and-bath place. Now it's closed.

04:33.327 --> 04:37.998
Maybe l shouldn't have come at all.
Jerk off!

04:39.458 --> 04:43.337
l'm just joking with you.

04:46.006 --> 04:51.845
The old McNair place! Never thought
they'd get the floors clean ...

04:52.012 --> 04:57.559
- What happened?
- They had a lot of cats.

04:57.726 --> 05:01.813
- Please mail this in when l'm done.
- Does it go to your boss?

05:01.980 --> 05:07.027
No, it goes to me.
l'm kind of a perfectioniss ...

05:07.194 --> 05:10.447
Perfectioniss ... t.

05:12.491 --> 05:15.494
Let's take a look.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.418
This could be a cool pad.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.674
Come on, baby.

05:28.840 --> 05:34.554
Come on, baby.
Talk to me.

05:34.721 --> 05:39.601
Tell me where you like it.

05:45.315 --> 05:49.528
Hello, Mama.

05:50.654 --> 05:56.243
ls this what you want?
ls this where you need it?

06:01.832 --> 06:04.918
How about this?

06:12.718 --> 06:16.054
That's your sweet spot, right there.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.437
Your lady kicked you out.

06:25.272 --> 06:27.399
What?

06:27.566 --> 06:34.614
l noticed you were previously wired
at 1 2681 l2 Chestnut.

06:34.781 --> 06:40.579
Last week, the billing
was transferred to one Robin Harris.

06:40.746 --> 06:45.792
- Smells like heartbreak to me.
- l don't want to discuss that.

06:45.959 --> 06:50.881
- Just install my cable, please.
- Suit yourself.

06:51.048 --> 06:54.384
No sweat off my sack.

06:54.551 --> 06:58.347
You might want to
put on a bathing suit.

06:58.513 --> 07:03.018
You'll be channel surfing
in no time.

07:17.741 --> 07:22.329
So ends day 54 of the trial
of former child star, Sam Sweet, -

07:22.496 --> 07:26.708
- who has been accused of shooting
his brother Stan in cold blood.

07:26.875 --> 07:33.090
The twins were stars of
the hit sitcom, "Double Trouble".

07:33.256 --> 07:37.010
- Who broke this?
- He did it!

07:37.177 --> 07:42.891
Life wasn't sweet
after their programme was cancelled.

07:43.058 --> 07:46.186
Sam turned to petty larceny, -

07:46.353 --> 07:51.775
- while his brother fell in with
the cult "Brotherhood of Friends".

07:54.861 --> 07:58.448
l hope they fry this bastard.

08:05.622 --> 08:09.334
What happened?

08:09.501 --> 08:14.715
Your furniture and appliances were
causing problems with the reception.

08:15.716 --> 08:21.596
- l moved a few things, okay?
- Yeah, l guess.

08:21.763 --> 08:25.851
l just have some paperwork
for you to fill out.

08:26.018 --> 08:32.399
lt's a drag. You just get to know
somebody and then the job is done.

08:32.566 --> 08:36.111
Sign here.

08:46.079 --> 08:50.167
l feel good about this.

08:54.963 --> 08:57.841
Hey, wait!

08:58.008 --> 09:04.014
l have this friend,
and he gave his cable guy $50 ...

09:04.181 --> 09:09.311
He got all the movie channels
for free. Did you ever hear of that?

09:17.319 --> 09:22.866
- You mean illegal cable?
- Yeah ...

09:23.033 --> 09:26.703
- Who told you that?
- Forget it.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.164
You're offering me a bribe.

09:29.331 --> 09:35.212
That's illegal. You could be fined
up to $5,000 or go to jail.

09:35.379 --> 09:39.257
No, l was just making conversation.
Forget it.

09:43.470 --> 09:47.557
l'm just jerking your chain.

09:49.142 --> 09:56.817
You are too easy. Wake up.
Smell the smelling salt.

09:56.984 --> 09:59.361
l'll juice you up.

10:00.195 --> 10:05.367
- One guy doing another guy a solid.
- That is so nice.

10:05.534 --> 10:13.208
Well, you're a nice guy.
Many customers treat me like snot.

10:13.375 --> 10:17.462
Here's my personal pager number.

10:17.629 --> 10:24.386
- The company puts you on hold.
- Thanks. You'll get good marks.

10:24.553 --> 10:29.349
Maybe l'll show you the satellite,
how this whole thing works.

10:29.516 --> 10:34.062
- Sure, we should do that one day.
- How about tomorrow?

10:34.229 --> 10:41.028
- Tomorrow's no good.
- You'll be stewing about your ex?

10:42.571 --> 10:46.325
No.

10:46.491 --> 10:53.665
- l crossed the line. Sorry.
- You didn't cross the line.

10:53.832 --> 10:57.878
Cool! Pick you up at six-thirty.

11:00.339 --> 11:06.011
There are 2 4 classrooms.
Each can be converted into a home.

11:06.178 --> 11:12.601
There's a swimming pool,
tennis courts, a gym and a stage, -

11:12.768 --> 11:16.647
- if the residents decide
they want to perform ''Oklahoma''.

11:16.813 --> 11:22.611
- Oklahoma!
- lt's available in foreclosure.

11:22.778 --> 11:26.323
With a cash bid,
we can steal this thing.

11:37.501 --> 11:41.171
Tough room, but you got them.

11:41.338 --> 11:45.717
Are you having
a little domestic discord?

11:45.884 --> 11:51.139
Robin and l are having difficulties.
l think it's only temporary.

11:51.306 --> 11:57.562
lf you screw this project up,
it's not going to be my ass.

11:57.729 --> 12:00.899
- Do you know what l mean?
- l'm on it.

12:01.066 --> 12:05.237
l'm more patient. l'm more loving.
They tell me this.

12:05.404 --> 12:10.117
There's something in everyone's life
they could improve.

12:10.283 --> 12:16.748
lf they're doing well financially,
maybe their relationships suffer ...

12:16.915 --> 12:23.797
Call now, and you'll be rushed
the "Personal Power Success System. "

12:26.842 --> 12:30.804
Steven!

12:30.971 --> 12:34.308
Stevie, time to leavie!

12:36.518 --> 12:43.025
Come on down!
Are you waiting for an invitation?

12:43.191 --> 12:47.571
lt's the fun bus. Come on!

12:50.824 --> 12:53.952
- How's it going?
- Hey, buddy!

12:54.911 --> 12:58.040
l've had a few drinks,
so buckle up.

12:58.206 --> 13:04.630
That's my humour.
Thanks for coming out.

13:04.796 --> 13:11.011
Most people never take the time
to understand how the cable works.

13:11.178 --> 13:17.476
- Where exactly are we going?
- To ride the information highway.

13:41.958 --> 13:47.297
l come up here to think sometimes.
Clear my head.

13:47.464 --> 13:51.259
Brace yourself.

13:52.552 --> 13:54.513
There she is.

14:02.145 --> 14:06.984
She's sending entertainment and
information to millions of citizens.

14:07.150 --> 14:14.366
- That's pretty impressive.
- l knew you'd appreciate this.

14:20.872 --> 14:23.125
The future is now!

14:23.291 --> 14:27.921
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer.

14:28.088 --> 14:33.093
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

14:33.260 --> 14:38.682
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

14:38.849 --> 14:43.437
There's no end to the possibilities!

14:45.897 --> 14:50.610
When l was a kid, my mom worked
nights. l never met my father.

14:50.777 --> 14:55.449
- But the TV was always there.
- l know what you mean.

14:55.615 --> 14:58.535
My dad might as well have been away.

15:01.663 --> 15:06.335
That's tough. You must have
a lot of abandonment issues.

15:06.501 --> 15:09.755
Reality isn't
''Father Knows Best'' any more.

15:09.921 --> 15:14.259
lt's a kick in the face
with a steel-toe work boot, -

15:14.426 --> 15:20.432
- and a trip to the hospital
for reconstructive surgery.

15:21.475 --> 15:25.771
But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

15:26.480 --> 15:31.360
My brother is a speech therapist.

15:33.070 --> 15:36.281
So?

15:36.448 --> 15:39.493
Never mind.

15:41.662 --> 15:46.625
- You're pretty love-struck, huh?
- l miss her.

15:46.792 --> 15:51.922
- l proposed, and she kicked me out.
- l hate that.

15:52.089 --> 15:59.972
- She said l pressed too hard.
- Women are a labyrinth, my friend.

16:00.138 --> 16:03.225
Can l be frank?

16:03.392 --> 16:09.690
l don't think you listen to her.
You tell her what she wants to hear.

16:09.856 --> 16:14.069
She wants you to thirst
for knowledge about who she is.

16:14.236 --> 16:18.699
All the complicated splendor
that is woman.

16:18.865 --> 16:25.122
When your love is truly giving,
it will come back to you tenfold.

16:25.288 --> 16:29.167
You're right.
That's incredibly insightful.

16:29.334 --> 16:33.588
lt was Jerry Springer's
final thought on Friday's show.

16:40.887 --> 16:46.226
Women love ''Sleepless in Seattle.''
lt's on HBO this month.

16:46.393 --> 16:50.522
- That's your bait.
- Robin loves that movie.

16:50.689 --> 16:58.155
Tell her you're cooking yourself
dinner and watching it by yourself.

16:58.322 --> 17:03.910
- She'll come running.
- Maybe l'll give it a try.

17:04.077 --> 17:08.957
lt's embarrassing,
l don't even know your name.

17:09.124 --> 17:12.419
Do you really want to know my name?

17:12.586 --> 17:15.631
You do?

17:21.261 --> 17:27.726
lt's Ernie Douglas.
But my friends call me Chip.

17:39.154 --> 17:44.159
Goodbye.

17:45.202 --> 17:48.538
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

17:48.705 --> 17:53.877
l don't listen to you.
l pretend to understand.

17:54.044 --> 17:57.422
l'm just saying
what l think you want to hear.

17:57.589 --> 18:05.722
l'm interested in learning about the
complicated splendor that is you.

18:05.889 --> 18:12.688
l can see that taking this time
might be good for us. l'm not mad.

18:14.523 --> 18:20.112
- Sometimes time apart is healthy.
- You're right.

18:21.405 --> 18:25.742
That's what l came here to say.

18:25.909 --> 18:29.287
l have to get back to the office.

18:30.664 --> 18:37.129
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.

18:37.296 --> 18:42.384
- ''Sleepless in Seattle'' is on TV.
- l love that movie.

18:42.551 --> 18:45.846
Why don't you come by?

18:46.013 --> 18:51.018
- Maybe l will.
- Whatever.

18:55.355 --> 18:59.276
l'm Tabitha Soren.
Today in the Sam Sweet case, -

18:59.443 --> 19:04.489
- the prosecution played the call
Sam made on the night of the murder.

19:04.656 --> 19:07.826
Mr. Sweet confessed one month later.

19:07.993 --> 19:12.331
Oh, my God.
My twin brother's been shot.

19:12.497 --> 19:17.586
l think it was
an Asian gang or something!

19:17.753 --> 19:23.800
l saw someone. He was speaking
another language. l'm pretty sure -

19:24.468 --> 19:26.970
- it was Asian.

19:39.024 --> 19:42.110
He had the same injury last year.

19:42.277 --> 19:45.656
You guys play here too?

19:47.783 --> 19:52.120
l thought l'd see if anybody
wanted to play round ball.

19:52.287 --> 19:56.875
- Great. We need another man.
- Chip Douglas, my cable guy.

19:57.042 --> 20:00.879
We met a week ago,
but l feel l've always known him.

20:01.046 --> 20:04.508
That's sweet.

20:05.467 --> 20:09.596
- Chip Douglas, you're on my team.
- No way.

20:09.763 --> 20:15.102
- l'm on Steven's team.
- l'll switch teams. Let's play.

20:15.268 --> 20:19.189
l've got to warm up!
l don't want to pull a hammy.

20:45.132 --> 20:48.927
- Let's get it on .
- You any good?

20:49.094 --> 20:51.680
You'll find out.

20:51.847 --> 20:55.267
Check it.

20:55.434 --> 20:58.312
Looks good.

20:58.478 --> 21:02.899
Let's see what you got,
White Shadow.

21:03.066 --> 21:05.610
Foul!

21:05.777 --> 21:10.282
- That was a travel!
- Whatever you say, Chip!

21:10.449 --> 21:14.411
l see.
We're playing prison rules, huh?

21:53.492 --> 21:55.952
Feed me!

21:59.122 --> 22:06.088
Steven, l'm open!
Feed me the rock!

22:08.090 --> 22:11.510
Chip, over here!

22:44.126 --> 22:48.213
l love this game.

22:50.132 --> 22:55.095
- l guess we're done.
- Thanks for bringing your friend.

22:57.097 --> 23:03.562
l never made a slam dunk before.
Thanks for the boost.

23:06.064 --> 23:09.192
What are you doing?

23:09.359 --> 23:14.156
- l'm just talking trash.
- You ruined the game.

23:14.323 --> 23:17.993
Friends don't speak to each other
like that.

23:18.160 --> 23:22.456
We're not friends.
l don't even know you.

23:22.622 --> 23:28.962
- Let me buy you a Heineken.
- l'm going home.

23:29.129 --> 23:33.717
l guess we'll talk later.
l have to do some stuff anyway.

23:43.852 --> 23:48.148
You have 1 1 new messages.

23:48.315 --> 23:53.320
Steven, it's Mom. Call me.
l'm still your mother, you know.

23:53.487 --> 23:57.282
Steven, call your mother.

23:57.449 --> 24:02.871
Hey, Steven. Give me a ring.
l'm at 555-4329.

24:03.038 --> 24:08.794
l'm at a pay phone.
lf you're there, pick up.

24:08.961 --> 24:12.130
l'll be home later.

24:12.297 --> 24:17.427
Okay, l'm home.
Give me a buzz when you get in.

24:17.594 --> 24:22.641
lt's me again. l was taking a whiz.
Thought you might have called.

24:23.850 --> 24:27.813
We're having ourselves
a game of phone tag here.

24:29.398 --> 24:35.821
l was just blow-drying my hair ...
Thought l heard the phone ring.

24:37.197 --> 24:40.575
l think your machine is ...

24:51.169 --> 24:56.049
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

25:05.434 --> 25:08.687
- So how's work?
- Work's good.

25:08.854 --> 25:15.027
- How's Hal?
- The guy has no vision.

25:15.193 --> 25:21.033
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
And those hair plugs ...

25:21.199 --> 25:28.290
He's just an utterly useless person.
l think l hate him.

25:28.457 --> 25:35.088
- lt's nice to see you doing well.
- lt's nice just to see you.

25:36.298 --> 25:40.719
Hey.
lt should be on now.

25:49.478 --> 25:54.024
Damn it.
The cable's out.

25:54.941 --> 26:00.739
l know what to do.
The cable guy is a friend of mine.

26:00.906 --> 26:06.078
l'm a preferred customer.
All l have to do is page him.

26:20.050 --> 26:26.014
- Hi. ls there a problem?
- My cable's out.

26:27.724 --> 26:32.688
Really?
So you called me.

26:32.854 --> 26:36.441
Funny, how you call
when you need something.

26:36.608 --> 26:42.864
- ls that how you treat people?
- l've been busy. Robin is here.

26:44.408 --> 26:50.288
- This is important.
- But calling me back isn't?

26:50.455 --> 26:54.710
l'm sorry.
Can you help me out?

26:55.794 --> 27:01.216
Why should l help you?
l gave you free cable.

27:01.383 --> 27:05.595
- What have you ever done for me?
- Anything you want.

27:05.762 --> 27:11.393
- Tomorrow night we hang out.
- Fine, anything you want.

27:11.560 --> 27:17.649
God bless you.
You're too good to me.

27:26.742 --> 27:29.786
All set!

27:33.206 --> 27:39.087
- What's with the cut cord?
- That's for effect. Until tomorrow.

27:39.254 --> 27:43.467
She's pretty. Don't kiss her.
Don't even touch her.

27:43.634 --> 27:50.682
Resist the urge at all costs.
lt'll pay off in the end.

27:50.849 --> 27:53.644
See what l'm saying?

27:56.813 --> 28:00.067
Enjoy the flick.

28:02.527 --> 28:06.031
That was fast.

28:06.198 --> 28:10.869
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine. Don't l look fine?

28:11.036 --> 28:16.500
That isn't how it's done.
l'd rather just see somebody l like.

28:16.667 --> 28:22.422
Get a feeling about them,
and ask them if they'd like a drink.

28:22.589 --> 28:26.677
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Does it still work this way?

28:26.843 --> 28:30.973
- lt doesn't. They ask you.
- l'm starting to notice that.

28:31.139 --> 28:35.060
lf you get a new wife,
do you get to have sex with her?

28:35.227 --> 28:40.524
- l certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

28:40.691 --> 28:42.776
What?

28:42.943 --> 28:47.447
ln movies, women always scratch
the man when they're having sex.

28:47.614 --> 28:51.785
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

29:01.336 --> 29:08.260
- Mommy's got to go out now.
- When will l get a brother?

29:08.427 --> 29:11.680
That's why Mommy is going out.

29:11.847 --> 29:17.102
Just sit there with Mr. Babysitter
and he'll take good care of you.

29:17.269 --> 29:22.024
Don't sit so close to that thing.
lt's going to rot your brain.

29:24.526 --> 29:30.073
- Why didn't you take my call?
- l can't always pick up the phone.

29:30.866 --> 29:35.412
Your nostrils flare
when you're mad.

29:43.545 --> 29:48.675
Sorry about yesterday.
How did everything go with you?

29:48.842 --> 29:52.596
- Keep them closed!
- Pretty well. The other night ...

29:52.763 --> 29:56.141
l want this to be a surprise.

29:56.308 --> 30:02.022
- Where are we going?
- The finest restaurant in town.

30:03.523 --> 30:06.693
Open ... sesame.

30:06.860 --> 30:09.738
Medieval Times?

30:11.907 --> 30:16.370
l knew you'd like it.
l come twice a week.

30:16.536 --> 30:23.919
l'm your serving wench, Melinda.
Care for something from the barkeep?

30:24.836 --> 30:27.965
Dost thust have thou a mug of ale?

30:28.131 --> 30:34.805
Me mate here, pitched in battle for
a fortnight, has a king's thirst.

30:36.640 --> 30:42.813
- l'll be right back, My Lord.
- My thanks to ye, fair wench.

30:45.357 --> 30:47.609
Thanks.

30:47.776 --> 30:54.199
- Look, l have to tell you ...
- Hold that thought. Show's on.

30:54.366 --> 31:00.831
Welcome to a magnificent journey ...
into the past.

31:00.998 --> 31:05.043
This is Medieval Times!

31:08.130 --> 31:12.551
Are you prepared for a night
of feasting and sport -

31:12.718 --> 31:16.596
- the likes of which
you'll never forget?

31:17.222 --> 31:22.019
Stand up and cheer
for your section's knight!

31:22.185 --> 31:26.440
Let the games begin!
The blue knight rules!

31:26.606 --> 31:33.822
The red knight sucks the big one!
You're going down, red knight!

31:33.989 --> 31:39.453
Going down, down, down!
Red knight going down!

31:42.748 --> 31:45.125
Smite him!

31:48.629 --> 31:54.092
- Could l get a knife and fork?
- There were none in medieval times.

31:54.259 --> 31:58.263
- More Pepsi?
- There was Pepsi, but no utensils?

31:58.430 --> 32:00.724
l've got a lot of tables.

32:06.063 --> 32:10.359
Can l have your skin?
Check this out.

32:16.865 --> 32:21.453
''Silence of the Lambs.''

32:21.620 --> 32:25.415
Hello, Clarice.
lt's good to see you again.

32:29.962 --> 32:34.007
This has nothing to do with you
as a person ...

32:34.174 --> 32:37.469
We have reached the climax
of our competition.

32:37.636 --> 32:45.102
Two noblemen from our audience
will battle to the death.

32:45.268 --> 32:52.484
Master Steven Kovacs and Lord Chip,
come to the fighting pit!

32:53.360 --> 32:56.655
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

32:56.822 --> 33:00.909
- We're going to do battle.
- ls this a normal part of the show?

33:01.076 --> 33:06.707
No, but l give all the knights
free cable.

33:06.873 --> 33:11.044
- ls it safe?
- Yes! That's what the armour's for!

33:13.005 --> 33:17.467
We have to be careful
not to hurt each other, right?

33:17.634 --> 33:23.890
l cannot listen to you,
for you are my sworn enemy.

33:29.813 --> 33:33.150
Just take it easy, all right?

33:40.699 --> 33:44.161
Nice move.

33:45.078 --> 33:48.749
Necessity ...
is the mother of invention.

33:51.960 --> 33:55.756
Come back ...
so that l may brain thee!

33:59.885 --> 34:04.264
My leg!
l have a cramp!

34:04.431 --> 34:07.476
Are you all right?

34:09.226 --> 34:12.731
l am now.

34:19.780 --> 34:22.074
Oh my God!

34:28.956 --> 34:34.335
That's the spirit!
Let's give them a show!

34:46.974 --> 34:53.188
l'm blinded! My eyes!

34:56.024 --> 34:59.653
l don't believe you.
lt's another trick.

34:59.820 --> 35:05.701
So that's how it's going to be?
You want to play rough?

35:05.867 --> 35:09.246
Daddy can play rough!

35:10.747 --> 35:16.920
This is like when Spock fought Kirk.
Best friends forced to do battle.

35:38.317 --> 35:42.279
Chip, this isn't funny!
Stop it!

35:43.322 --> 35:49.453
The name is Spock. lf we don't fight
to the death, they'll kill us both.

35:49.620 --> 35:52.205
This isn't ''Star Trek''.

35:57.628 --> 36:01.298
Goodbye, Jim.

36:18.231 --> 36:21.568
Good fight.

36:21.735 --> 36:25.238
Keep eating!

36:27.783 --> 36:31.036
Quickly! Muster atop your steed.

36:33.205 --> 36:38.835
Get on the friggin' horse.
l don't think he's kidding.

36:39.002 --> 36:43.882
- Don't do this!
- Good luck to you!

36:44.049 --> 36:48.971
- This is our destiny!
- No, it's not!

36:49.137 --> 36:53.266
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

37:03.110 --> 37:06.154
Are you all right?

37:11.076 --> 37:15.914
Well done, good sir.
You are the victor.

37:16.081 --> 37:19.626
But we will meet again.

37:35.726 --> 37:39.479
Did you hear that?

37:39.646 --> 37:45.360
- You have a warrior's instinct.
- l had a real feeling of power.

37:45.527 --> 37:49.948
lf Robin had seen you,
she'd be begging you to come back.

37:50.115 --> 37:53.493
These knights get laid all the time!

37:53.660 --> 37:57.539
We should go again next week.

37:57.706 --> 38:03.629
- You have no messages.
- Nobody loves you.

38:03.795 --> 38:09.718
l left something in the living room.
Will you check it out for me?

38:09.885 --> 38:13.847
Just a little piece of equipment.

38:19.645 --> 38:25.275
- What do you think?
- What is all this?

38:26.109 --> 38:33.033
lt appears as if someone has updated
your home entertainment system.

38:33.784 --> 38:38.997
l got you the big-screen TV,
deluxe karaoke machine -

38:39.164 --> 38:44.670
- and THX quality sound that would
make George Lucas cream his pants.

38:44.836 --> 38:51.885
- You got in here when l was out?
- How else could l get the stuff in?

38:52.052 --> 38:56.264
- How much did all of this cost?
- Practically nothing.

38:56.431 --> 39:01.561
l have a connection.
l hook him up, he hooks me up.

39:01.728 --> 39:06.358
- l can't accept this.
- Why not?

39:06.525 --> 39:10.612
You give me something more valuable.
Friendship.

39:10.779 --> 39:17.786
You give me friendship. We're even.
You have to take this stuff back.

39:21.540 --> 39:29.131
- Can l leave it here till Saturday.
- Sure. No problem.

39:29.298 --> 39:35.804
Hi, this is Robin Harris. Steven
doesn't live here any more ...

39:35.971 --> 39:41.435
Hey, it's Steven.
l'm still trying to reach you ...

39:41.601 --> 39:45.272
l'm at the office. Call me.

39:46.231 --> 39:49.443
- How's it going?
- Good.

39:49.609 --> 39:54.156
Good.
Keep it up. lt's your ass.

39:54.323 --> 39:57.743
lt's Robin on line two.

39:57.909 --> 40:02.873
l had the best time the other night.
When will l see you again?

40:03.040 --> 40:08.670
- How about tomorrow?
- Chip!

40:08.837 --> 40:12.466
l knew l'd get you
on the phone that way.

40:12.633 --> 40:17.971
Let's break the cherry
on that karaoke machine.

40:18.138 --> 40:22.851
- What does that mean?
- Karaoke jam. No ifs, ands or buts.

40:23.018 --> 40:28.440
Maybe a few buts.
Big ones!

40:49.795 --> 40:52.923
You're going on a date?

40:53.090 --> 41:00.055
We're not officially back together.
And you said time apart is good.

41:00.222 --> 41:05.394
Yes. Time apart from each other,
but not with other people.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.688
That's time with someone else.

41:07.854 --> 41:13.402
- l love you, but l have to go. Bye.
- Bye.

41:21.451 --> 41:25.747
This is just a sign
that you need to live a little.

41:26.999 --> 41:32.754
- She's having fun. You should, too.
- Maybe you're right.

41:33.547 --> 41:40.012
- l got you a little something.
- You said we were even.

41:40.178 --> 41:45.267
You're breaking the rules.
What is it?

41:48.937 --> 41:53.608
LOOSE YOUR LlSP
lN 30 DAYS

41:53.775 --> 41:57.529
My brother thought
it might help you.

41:57.696 --> 42:03.619
- This is ... There's no words ...
- lt's no big deal.

42:03.785 --> 42:08.081
Yes, it is!
lt is to me.

42:08.248 --> 42:13.045
Now l'm on a mission.

42:13.211 --> 42:18.467
This is going to be
the best damn karaoke jam ever.

42:27.934 --> 42:32.105
We're really bopping!

42:33.440 --> 42:38.403
- You have some nice friends.
- They're just preferred customers.

42:38.570 --> 42:43.241
Chick alert, two o'clock.
What a licorice!

42:46.787 --> 42:50.415
- Don't look.
- You're just playing with me.

42:50.582 --> 42:55.587
- She's all over you.
- Shut up.

42:55.754 --> 43:01.718
l'd strike while the iron is hot.
He who hesitates, masturbates.

43:01.885 --> 43:05.013
Go.

43:06.515 --> 43:11.895
- Hey. l'm Steven.
- Heather.

43:12.062 --> 43:17.734
- Can l get you a beer?
- How about a tequila?

43:22.072 --> 43:25.284
Hi, Rick.

43:25.450 --> 43:28.203
That'll be a good one.

43:28.370 --> 43:33.208
- Glad you accepted my invitation.
- Steven invited me.

43:33.375 --> 43:36.586
He's having a super time.

43:38.922 --> 43:44.803
He's changing. You'll have to learn
to live with that.

43:46.763 --> 43:53.145
l don't know what your story is,
but l'm going to find out.

43:53.312 --> 44:00.444
Don't dig too deep. You might
get burned by the molten lava.

44:01.528 --> 44:05.115
l'm out of here.

44:11.663 --> 44:14.708
Thank you.

44:16.585 --> 44:21.673
The soothing sounds of Raoul,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.261
- You had honey in your voice.
- Do a song for us.

44:26.428 --> 44:29.848
No, l couldn't.

44:30.015 --> 44:34.019
All right, already!

44:34.186 --> 44:37.272
l fought the law, and the law won.

44:39.024 --> 44:44.237
Jefferson Airplane performed
this song in ''Gimme Shelter'', -

44:44.404 --> 44:49.618
- a film about how the Hell's Angels
had their way at a Stones concert.

44:49.785 --> 44:53.330
Tonight ... it's my turn.

45:22.609 --> 45:29.825
- What do you do?
- Can we talk in the other room?

46:52.324 --> 46:56.286
We just had a baby born
at the party.

46:56.453 --> 47:00.874
We need an ambulance
over by the scaffolding.

47:01.041 --> 47:04.503
Shut the door!

47:19.643 --> 47:26.149
lt's the summer of love, baby.
Let's leave these two alone.

47:26.316 --> 47:30.362
Smile!
That's going to be a good one.

47:46.128 --> 47:50.549
Good morning,
and how are we today?

47:50.716 --> 47:55.470
l borrowed this sweatshirt.
Bacon and eggs, coming up.

47:55.637 --> 48:01.059
- Where did Heather go?
- She left early this morning.

48:01.226 --> 48:04.354
You cad.

48:05.480 --> 48:11.486
- What a night. Just what l needed.
- l'll tell you something.

48:11.653 --> 48:15.657
You look like a new man.

48:15.824 --> 48:21.997
l was getting so used to rejection.
l really liked her.

48:22.164 --> 48:26.293
lt was my treat.

48:27.169 --> 48:34.551
- What do you mean?
- You can buy next time.

48:36.053 --> 48:42.517
- Don't let your eggs get cold.
- Buy what?

48:42.684 --> 48:48.940
What do you mean, buy what?
The women.

48:49.107 --> 48:53.820
Do you mean
that Heather is a prostitute?

48:53.987 --> 48:58.951
Of course. We couldn't get
a woman like that without paying.

48:59.117 --> 49:02.120
This can't be happening.

49:02.287 --> 49:11.463
lt's okay. She's totally clean.
l checked her out about a week ago.

49:11.630 --> 49:18.470
To make sure she was good. And l'm
healthy as a horse ... Not a drip.

49:19.763 --> 49:26.228
- Would you like some juice?
- You're kidding. She's your friend.

49:26.395 --> 49:31.274
- l wish l had friends like that.
- Get out of my house!

49:31.441 --> 49:36.029
She was a working girl,
but she liked you.

49:36.196 --> 49:39.866
You might even have got a freebie.

49:40.033 --> 49:45.205
l don't ever want to see you again.
Robin will never forgive me.

49:45.372 --> 49:49.167
Don't tell her.
l'll help you get her back.

49:49.334 --> 49:53.547
l want you out of my apartment.
And get this stuff out of here.

49:53.714 --> 49:58.677
Why are you doing this?
You're sabotaging yourself.

49:58.844 --> 50:01.388
Out! Now!

50:01.555 --> 50:05.267
Everything was going so well.

50:05.434 --> 50:09.521
l made you breakfast,
and we were eating ...

50:09.688 --> 50:12.065
Out!

50:12.232 --> 50:17.154
l'll fix this.
l can make it cool again.

50:17.321 --> 50:20.240
This is just a speed bump!

50:24.703 --> 50:28.874
- May l help you?
- No. l'm meeting someone here.

50:41.678 --> 50:45.641
l apologize about last night.
l came home and l just fell asleep.

50:55.859 --> 50:59.321
Most appreciated.

50:59.488 --> 51:04.952
Gail tells me
you're coming out of a relationship.

51:05.118 --> 51:10.666
- We're in a holding pattern.
- A holding pattern?

51:10.832 --> 51:14.920
You need to come down and refuel.

51:16.546 --> 51:18.840
You're sexy.

51:23.971 --> 51:29.059
You've been working hard.
Take a break.

51:35.816 --> 51:39.319
Excuse me.
What's the story with our chicken?

51:39.486 --> 51:46.743
Have the eggs had a chance to hatch?
Maybe you can go check on it for me.

51:47.577 --> 51:50.163
l'm sorry to put you out.

51:50.330 --> 51:52.916
Unbelievable.

51:53.083 --> 51:57.254
l'm hysterical now.
What were we talking about?

51:57.421 --> 52:05.387
- What's your job like?
- lt's a little crazy right now ...

52:05.554 --> 52:12.978
Wait. l need to use the head.
l want to find out about your job.

52:13.145 --> 52:15.731
What's with the chicken?

52:21.820 --> 52:25.198
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

52:25.365 --> 52:28.368
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, stretch.

52:28.535 --> 52:33.874
- Pleasant night, isn't it?
- Yeah, not too bad.

52:34.041 --> 52:41.548
The weather is always nice in here.
The winters are remarkably mild!

52:46.303 --> 52:52.309
- lf you need anything, let me know!
- l got it under control!

52:52.476 --> 52:56.146
- Unbelievable.
- lt's no trouble.

52:56.313 --> 52:59.358
What is your ..?

52:59.316 --> 53:03.904
People rarely take advantage of
my services. l'll help you wash up.

53:04.071 --> 53:06.949
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

53:10.869 --> 53:14.331
You're on a big date.

53:15.165 --> 53:17.876
You'll need to look your best.

53:21.129 --> 53:26.510
That'll take care of the shine.
Now, let's pluck those eyebrows!

53:26.677 --> 53:30.263
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me ...

53:30.430 --> 53:34.267
... she loves me not.

53:34.434 --> 53:38.105
A little Jose Eber ...

53:41.566 --> 53:43.860
A touch of Alfalfa ...

53:44.027 --> 53:47.823
We're ready to dry you off!

53:47.990 --> 53:52.411
Right into the buckle.
That's got to hurt!

53:55.998 --> 53:59.167
Suck the air.

53:59.334 --> 54:02.921
You look just like Dizzy Gillespie.

54:16.351 --> 54:21.565
Don't worry about the tip.
But l've got one for you.

54:21.732 --> 54:26.278
Stay away from Robin.
She's taken.

54:34.036 --> 54:40.042
A man was beaten in a restroom
by a bathroom attendant.

54:40.208 --> 54:48.216
The victim is unable to speak, but
witnesses described the assailant.

54:48.383 --> 54:52.554
Tonight on UPN: The trial
that has captured the nation.

54:52.721 --> 54:58.101
Everyone awaits the verdict,
but we're showing the movie now.

54:58.268 --> 55:02.022
- Cry - baby.
- l love you.

55:02.189 --> 55:07.361
- No, Sammy!
- Look who's crying now.

55:07.527 --> 55:13.617
Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet
in "Brother Sweet Brother".

55:13.784 --> 55:16.203
Parental discretion advised.

55:28.131 --> 55:32.678
- Who is it?
- lt's the cable guy!

55:32.844 --> 55:36.223
My cable's fine.

55:36.390 --> 55:41.937
l have an upgrade order
for one Robin Harris.

55:42.104 --> 55:46.024
l didn't order that.

55:47.609 --> 55:51.113
l guess you have a secret admirer.

55:54.324 --> 55:58.328
- ls it a man named Steven?
- l can't say.

55:58.495 --> 56:03.083
l promised Steven l wouldn't say.
Oh, look what l've done.

56:03.250 --> 56:07.296
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Hold on.

56:27.566 --> 56:32.154
- Male witches are the worst kind.
- He's not a witch.

56:38.660 --> 56:42.789
That about does it.
My work is done.

56:46.627 --> 56:50.589
That was hot up there.

56:53.133 --> 56:57.804
- Are you a friend of Steven's?
- l'm proud to say that l am.

56:57.971 --> 57:02.434
l recently installed his cable
and we just hit it off.

57:02.601 --> 57:07.356
- Are you guys going out a lot?
- Not really.

57:07.522 --> 57:11.068
That guy is devoted to you.

57:11.234 --> 57:14.988
l shouldn't be telling you this ...

57:15.155 --> 57:19.868
... but he thinks
you're the cat's pyjamas.

57:20.035 --> 57:23.288
Did he say that?

57:23.455 --> 57:29.503
Only every five minutes.
Frankly l'm sick of hearing it.

57:29.670 --> 57:32.798
He's a good man.

57:32.965 --> 57:38.512
He mentioned
that you've had some problems.

57:38.679 --> 57:43.225
- lt's a little complicated.
- lt always is.

57:43.392 --> 57:46.937
l asked a woman to marry me once.

57:47.104 --> 57:53.527
She wanted to think about it.
We agreed to take some time apart.

57:53.694 --> 57:58.448
You know ...
give each other space.

58:01.535 --> 58:04.329
She's no longer with us.

58:06.498 --> 58:09.042
l'm sorry.

58:09.209 --> 58:15.173
Sometimes you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

58:16.633 --> 58:23.056
Promise me you'll never
go bungee jumping in Mexico.

58:23.223 --> 58:27.311
- l promise.
- Anyway ...

58:27.477 --> 58:31.315
l've said too much.

58:33.108 --> 58:36.069
Thank you.

58:37.446 --> 58:41.867
Cherish him, Robin.
Every hair on his head.

58:48.165 --> 58:51.126
Excuse me.

58:51.293 --> 58:53.795
- Hello.
- l love you.

58:53.962 --> 58:58.008
Robin?
l love you, too.

58:58.175 --> 59:02.512
That was so sweet of you.

59:02.679 --> 59:06.683
- You didn't have to do that.
- l ... l wanted to.

59:06.850 --> 59:10.937
Giving me free cable. Only you
would do something like that.

59:14.608 --> 59:19.780
l wanted to do something for you,
but you needed space, so ...

59:19.947 --> 59:24.117
Let's not make any more rules.

59:24.284 --> 59:31.166
- Call me later if you're around.
- Sure, as soon as l get home.

59:31.333 --> 59:34.920
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:35.087 --> 59:41.009
- Are you ready to rock?
- The concert. Oh, Jesus.

59:41.176 --> 59:45.222
l think Robin and l
are getting back together.

59:45.389 --> 59:52.479
So you're blowing me off again.
l won't put up with it any more.

59:59.820 --> 01:00:05.951
- Can't you ask someone else to go?
- Maybe l'll take my cable guy.

01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:15.794
l'll call you later ...

01:00:20.507 --> 01:00:25.137
Pretty smooth work.
l set them up, you knock them down.

01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:32.436
- What?
- Robin. l got her back for you.

01:00:32.602 --> 01:00:37.190
- How do you know about us?
- Free cable's an aphrodisiac.

01:00:37.357 --> 01:00:43.447
- Don't mess around with my life.
- l wanted to make things up to you.

01:00:46.366 --> 01:00:49.119
Do you want to catch a flick?

01:00:53.624 --> 01:00:58.378
l appreciate
you helping me out with Robin.

01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:06.178
Now l'll have to work extra hard
not to screw things up again.

01:01:06.345 --> 01:01:14.686
You're a nice guy, but l just
don't have time for a new friend.

01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:24.655
- What are you trying to say?
- l don't want to be your friend.

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:32.162
l appreciate your honesty.
You're a straight shooter.

01:01:33.205 --> 01:01:39.252
- So you're all right?
- l'm a big boy.

01:01:39.419 --> 01:01:43.548
lt's no big deal.
Whatever.

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:53.767
- You're sure?
- Uh-huh. l'm fine.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:16.331
- Robin Harris.
- Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:22.462
- Chip Douglas?
- The cable guy.

01:02:22.629 --> 01:02:30.137
- What's up?
- l'm worried about Steven.

01:02:30.304 --> 01:02:36.935
- What is it?
- He doesn't seem like himself.

01:02:37.102 --> 01:02:42.983
- Have you noticed anything?
- No. Things are going really well.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:49.114
Good.
That makes me feel better.

01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:55.954
- Should l be worried?
- No. Maybe l'm being too nervous.

01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:02.169
Let's just keep our eyes open.

01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:06.423
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:03:07.841 --> 01:03:11.553
Stevie, you did it, man.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.350
You put our cajones on the table
and you slam-dunked it.

01:03:16.516 --> 01:03:19.770
Way to go. Now they'll probably
give him my job.

01:03:19.936 --> 01:03:25.859
- On to the next order of business.
- Steven, l need to talk to you.

01:03:27.527 --> 01:03:31.782
We have to find an architect.

01:03:31.949 --> 01:03:35.786
- l need to talk to you.
- lt shall wait.

01:03:35.953 --> 01:03:42.626
- ls there a Steven Kovacs here?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

01:03:42.793 --> 01:03:46.838
You're under arrest
for receiving stolen property.

01:03:47.005 --> 01:03:52.427
- l don't know anything about this.
- Do not speak until spoken to.

01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:57.557
You have the right to remain silent.

01:03:57.724 --> 01:04:02.104
- You have the right to an attorney.
- l didn't accept any stolen goods.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:06.900
Deluxe karaoke machine.
Big - screen TV ...

01:04:07.067 --> 01:04:09.820
Cream his pants ...

01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:20.289
l can't believe you did this.

01:04:20.455 --> 01:04:26.920
He gave you a big-screen TV
and a hi-fi system as a present?

01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:30.757
- l swear it's true.
- Why would you accept such gifts?

01:04:30.924 --> 01:04:37.014
- l don't know.
- What's going on? Are you on pot?

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.143
l didn't do anything!
Just call my cable guy.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:47.065
Nobody named Chip Douglas
works for the cable company.

01:04:47.232 --> 01:04:51.778
- This can't be happening.
- lt's killing your mother.

01:04:51.945 --> 01:04:57.075
- When can you get me out?
- There'll be no bail hearing today.

01:04:57.242 --> 01:05:00.579
You have to spend the weekend here.

01:05:00.746 --> 01:05:03.832
Look at the pretty boy!

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:12.341
They call me the pumper.
l'll be your friend.

01:05:12.507 --> 01:05:15.636
Lock down!

01:05:24.936 --> 01:05:28.607
You hear anything?

01:05:30.609 --> 01:05:33.528
l came as soon as l could.

01:05:33.695 --> 01:05:38.158
- What's your real name?
- Larry Tate. That's not important.

01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:43.413
We have to get you out of here.
l was watching Court TV.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:48.418
l'll talk to the judge.
l'll put the system on trial!

01:05:48.585 --> 01:05:52.965
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You did this to you.

01:05:53.131 --> 01:05:58.637
- You set me up.
- No. l taught you a lesson.

01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:03.767
l can be your friend or your enemy.
You seem to prefer the latter.

01:06:03.934 --> 01:06:06.269
l'm just here to comfort you.

01:06:08.522 --> 01:06:12.943
Touch it.
You need human contact.

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:16.196
l will not touch it.

01:06:18.198 --> 01:06:22.911
- What are you doing?
- l know how you're feeling!

01:06:23.078 --> 01:06:28.292
- Don't do that.
- l'm here for you!

01:06:29.543 --> 01:06:33.630
Don't do that! You'll get me killed!

01:06:34.006 --> 01:06:37.759
Oh, Billy.

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:47.686
l'm just messing with you.

01:06:47.853 --> 01:06:52.149
Remember ''Midnight Express''?
Oliver Stone won an Academy Award.

01:06:52.316 --> 01:06:54.651
Awesome scene.

01:06:54.818 --> 01:06:58.864
This is the man who framed me!

01:06:59.031 --> 01:07:02.951
Hey Bernie,
how's that sports package?

01:07:06.038 --> 01:07:13.086
Don't worry about Robin.
l'll take care of her.

01:07:13.837 --> 01:07:19.676
- lf you go near her, l'll kill you.
- That's it. Let's go!

01:07:21.803 --> 01:07:27.809
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

01:07:27.976 --> 01:07:32.022
- You've been blowing me off.
- This guy's doing a number on me.

01:07:32.189 --> 01:07:35.859
- l told you to stay away from him.
- You said l could get free cable.

01:07:36.026 --> 01:07:39.863
Did l tell you
to have a karaoke jam with him?

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:43.992
l'm out on bail.

01:07:47.204 --> 01:07:51.625
l'll see if l can track him down.
What was his name?

01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:56.880
Larry Tate. But at first he said
his name was Chip Douglas.

01:07:57.047 --> 01:08:01.134
Chip Douglas?
That sounds familiar.

01:08:02.302 --> 01:08:05.013
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.559
- You're not fine.
- l just want to get this over with.

01:08:09.726 --> 01:08:12.270
l hate visiting my parents.

01:08:14.022 --> 01:08:19.903
ls this guy cool?
Just joking. Come in, you psycho.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:25.492
- What is he doing here?
- l invited him.

01:08:25.658 --> 01:08:28.787
- l invited him at lunch.
- At lunch?

01:08:28.953 --> 01:08:33.542
- You look great.
- And you are a vision.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:39.214
- You look rested.
- Come here.

01:08:39.756 --> 01:08:45.595
- What's wrong? You seem weird.
- You had me sent to jail.

01:08:45.761 --> 01:08:50.850
- l should take you to the police.
- You can if you like.

01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:54.813
But l'd hate
to have to show Robin this.

01:08:55.354 --> 01:09:00.694
- Bastard!
- Let's just have a good time.

01:09:02.654 --> 01:09:08.702
Steven is carrying his battle axe
and chasing me ...

01:09:08.868 --> 01:09:13.457
So l say, ''Hey, it's just a show!''

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:21.965
- He takes things too seriously.
- The guy almost took my head off.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:32.725
Did never played Porno Password?
lt's the adult version of the show.

01:09:32.893 --> 01:09:37.648
Robin, you're on my team.
Steven ... you're with Mom.

01:09:37.814 --> 01:09:40.442
You're the judges.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.236
Pick a word.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:57.292
The password is ...

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:00.337
Vagina.

01:10:00.504 --> 01:10:04.549
- l really don't want to play.
- Come on, Steven.

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:10.597
Woman.

01:10:10.764 --> 01:10:14.101
- Woman.
- Man?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.401
Penis.

01:10:23.902 --> 01:10:27.072
Penis.

01:10:29.199 --> 01:10:32.244
- Penis.
- Vagina.

01:10:35.414 --> 01:10:38.792
She got vagina!

01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:44.339
- l would have said ''schlong''.
- Now we're starting to get this!

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:56.935
The password is ...

01:10:58.478 --> 01:11:01.481
Nipple.

01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:05.152
- Can l pass?
- Don't be a stick in the mud!

01:11:07.613 --> 01:11:10.741
Breast.

01:11:10.907 --> 01:11:13.702
Breast.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:16.913
Tit?

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:23.420
Remember his clue.

01:11:24.087 --> 01:11:27.341
Hard.

01:11:29.926 --> 01:11:34.848
- Erection?
- No. But thanks for noticing.

01:11:37.225 --> 01:11:41.980
- Your turn!
- Center.

01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:47.027
Center.

01:11:48.236 --> 01:11:52.074
- Center!
- Nipple?

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.911
- She got it!
- Mom.

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:05.921
The password is ...

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:10.050
l'm not sure how to say this.

01:12:10.217 --> 01:12:13.470
That little thing ...

01:12:13.637 --> 01:12:17.975
- l can't say that to my mother.
- She can handle it.

01:12:18.141 --> 01:12:21.687
l won't do it. l've had enough!

01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:27.609
- lt's just skin, Steven.
- l don't want to do it any more!

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:32.739
- You're overreacting.
- No! He's fooling you all.

01:12:32.906 --> 01:12:39.413
- He's a lunatic and a felon.
- Everybody just relax.

01:12:39.579 --> 01:12:44.710
- We knew this would happen.
- Nothing is happening!

01:12:44.876 --> 01:12:49.798
This is a safe place.
You're with people who love you.

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:54.886
- We love you.
- l hate you! Get out of my life!

01:12:55.053 --> 01:13:00.267
- He's angry with me. l should go.
- No.

01:13:00.434 --> 01:13:04.855
- You are being an asshole.
- Do you see what's happening?

01:13:05.022 --> 01:13:08.984
- You're hitting bottom.
- Stay away.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:14.156
This is where the healing begins.
Come on.

01:13:15.115 --> 01:13:20.787
Robin showed me her birthmark.
lt's very sexy.

01:13:26.126 --> 01:13:29.421
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:36.845
Thanks for the delightful evening.
l guess l'll be leaving now.

01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:50.943
l forgive you. l only hope
my neurologist will feel the same.

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:01.453
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

01:14:01.453 --> 01:14:05.707
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:12.881
HELLO STEVEN
l'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:22.766
- How's Hal?
- The man has no vision.

01:14:22.933 --> 01:14:29.356
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
lf only someone would dump him.

01:14:29.523 --> 01:14:33.402
And those hair plugs ...

01:14:33.568 --> 01:14:37.948
- Hair plugs. Hair plugs ...
- Oh, shit.

01:14:38.115 --> 01:14:43.745
He's so pathetic.
l think l hate him. Hate him ...

01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:56.008
lf only someone would dump him.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.977
l ... l don't hate you.

01:15:07.144 --> 01:15:11.690
- Those hair plugs.
- Get out!

01:15:38.383 --> 01:15:41.511
Chip!

01:15:42.721 --> 01:15:45.766
This isn't funny!

01:15:47.059 --> 01:15:50.479
Where are you?

01:15:54.232 --> 01:15:58.195
lf you build it, he will come.

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:18.340
- Hello?
- Bingo! ''My Three Sons''.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:24.304
- Chip and Ernie Douglas.
- l have a list of ex-cable men.

01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:26.682
Murray Slaughter.

01:16:26.848 --> 01:16:29.559
George Jetson. Jean Luc Picard.

01:16:29.726 --> 01:16:34.606
- Someone called the Big Ragoo.
- Carmine, from ''Laverne & Shirley''.

01:16:34.773 --> 01:16:42.364
Anyway, the cable company in town
fired a guy six months ago.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:48.870
His boss was Larry Tate,
from a show called ''Bewitched''.

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:53.583
- He's not with the cable company?
- Yahtzee!

01:16:54.543 --> 01:17:01.925
They fired him for stalking
customers. You better lock up tight.

01:17:02.092 --> 01:17:07.514
ln the Sam Sweet Trial,
the jury is close to a verdict.

01:17:07.681 --> 01:17:12.936
They will continue deliberating
into the evening hours.

01:17:13.103 --> 01:17:18.442
The day started real nice,
but now the moisture is increasing.

01:17:18.609 --> 01:17:22.070
We see thunderstorms ...

01:17:27.618 --> 01:17:30.495
Cable guy!

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:35.042
Cable guy!

01:17:48.472 --> 01:17:51.933
Jesucristo!

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:56.104
Cable guy!

01:18:19.836 --> 01:18:23.840
Okay, l'm going!

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.514
See you! Bye.

01:18:46.196 --> 01:18:50.409
l just want to hang out!
No big deal!

01:19:13.724 --> 01:19:17.936
- Hello?
- We could have been blood brothers.

01:19:18.103 --> 01:19:22.941
But you're too needy.
lt's a real turn-off. Ask Robin.

01:19:23.108 --> 01:19:26.737
The cable company fired you.

01:19:26.903 --> 01:19:31.450
Hold on.
l have a call waiting.

01:19:44.921 --> 01:19:48.842
- l know it's you.
- Sorry. Where was l?

01:19:49.009 --> 01:19:52.262
- Can't we work this out?
- l wish we could.

01:19:52.429 --> 01:19:59.436
- l'm just so tired, Steven.
- Where are you?

01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:06.860
l'd love to chat, but l'm
getting together with a lady friend.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:12.950
- You might know her.
- Stay away from her!

01:20:18.622 --> 01:20:26.046
- Robin!
- She just left with the cable guy!

01:20:26.213 --> 01:20:29.216
Where were they going?

01:20:29.383 --> 01:20:35.138
l heard him say they were taking
a ride on the information highway.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.356
The future is now!

01:20:44.523 --> 01:20:49.528
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer!

01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:55.617
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:21:02.499
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

01:21:07.546 --> 01:21:10.882
l want to go home now.
l'm worried about Steven.

01:21:37.868 --> 01:21:41.663
- Help!
- Robin!

01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:45.876
Where are you?

01:21:46.043 --> 01:21:50.380
- Steven!
- l'm coming!

01:21:56.428 --> 01:22:00.390
- Help me!
- Hang on!

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:15.447
- Steven, look out!
- Yes, Steven! Look out!

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.590
''Dry land is not a myth!''
Kevin Costner, ''Waterworld''.

01:22:33.757 --> 01:22:39.721
- Leave him alone!
- l saw that movie six times!

01:22:41.932 --> 01:22:45.644
lsn't it funny
that we ended up like this?

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:58.532
You'll have to do
better than that, Steven.

01:23:03.245 --> 01:23:06.957
My lisp is gone!

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:11.336
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

01:23:13.839 --> 01:23:18.635
- Stop it! Steven!
- l'm coming!

01:23:28.145 --> 01:23:33.859
The trouble with real life is,
there's no danger music.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:49.958
Nice jump, Spiderman!

01:23:53.545 --> 01:23:59.051
Steven called the fuzz!

01:23:59.217 --> 01:24:02.929
Bad boys,
what you gonna do?

01:24:04.264 --> 01:24:08.018
Skooch over just a tad.

01:24:16.026 --> 01:24:18.904
Here comes our hero.

01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:23.617
- lt didn't have to be this way.
- What are you planning to do?

01:24:23.784 --> 01:24:31.416
l don't really have a plan.
l'm going moment to moment now.

01:24:31.583 --> 01:24:35.379
You have to admit,
it's a cool place for an ending.

01:24:35.545 --> 01:24:38.840
- An ending to what?
- lt's like ''Golden Eye''.

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:45.138
This isn't a movie!
This is reality!

01:24:45.305 --> 01:24:50.060
This is the police! You're
trespassing in a restricted area!

01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:00.529
l just wanted to be your friend ...

01:25:00.696 --> 01:25:04.491
... but l screwed it up.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:11.581
- You are in a high - voltage area!
- What's that?

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:16.169
Come again?

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:24.428
You want me to quiet down
and chill out in front of the TV?

01:25:27.973 --> 01:25:31.310
You were never there for me,
were you, Mother?

01:25:35.105 --> 01:25:39.234
You expected Mike and Carol Brady
to raise me.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:46.950
l'm the bastard son of Claire
Huxtable! l'm the lost Cunningham!

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:54.374
l learned the facts of life ...
from watching ''The Facts of Life''!

01:26:05.177 --> 01:26:08.680
That's it.

01:26:11.683 --> 01:26:15.103
That's what l have to do!

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:19.816
No. Don't do that!

01:26:19.983 --> 01:26:24.613
- Let's go out and have a Heineken.
- Yeah!

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.908
l'm not thirsty any more.

01:26:28.492 --> 01:26:31.954
See ya.

01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:43.006
You're not going anywhere!

01:26:43.173 --> 01:26:48.470
lt's okay!
l understand my purpose now!

01:26:48.637 --> 01:26:52.683
Don't do this. You just need help.
We all get lonely.

01:26:52.849 --> 01:26:58.939
But l get really lonely.
Look at me!

01:27:02.401 --> 01:27:10.075
- l'll be your pal. Just come on up!
- No. lt's too late for me.

01:27:10.867 --> 01:27:16.456
But there are a lot of cable boys
and girls who still have a chance!

01:27:17.124 --> 01:27:20.836
Don't you understand, Steven?

01:27:28.385 --> 01:27:33.348
Somebody has to kill the babysitter.

01:27:43.525 --> 01:27:51.408
This is the moment we've been
waiting for. The jury is ready ...

01:27:51.575 --> 01:27:56.038
The jury has notified the judge
that they've reached a verdict.

01:28:07.257 --> 01:28:11.762
- The moment of truth ...
- Jacob Sweet has been found ...

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.948
Help.

01:28:35.202 --> 01:28:38.163
Preferred customer, my ass!

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:28.046
Squad 51 . Man down.
Possible back injury.

01:29:30.674 --> 01:29:35.721
We'll need an lV with D-5-W.

01:29:35.887 --> 01:29:39.391
Check vital signs.

01:29:40.601 --> 01:29:43.812
Prepare to defibrillate!

01:29:53.447 --> 01:29:56.158
Wait!

01:30:01.872 --> 01:30:05.000
You two will be just fine.

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:09.838
Take care of him, Robin.
He's good people.

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:13.884
You never told me your real name.

01:30:14.051 --> 01:30:17.971
You still want to know my name?

01:30:22.726 --> 01:30:27.981
lt's ... Ricardo.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:31.985
Ricky Ricardo.

01:30:42.162 --> 01:30:45.874
l'm just messing with you.

01:31:06.019 --> 01:31:09.356
Let's go home.

01:31:14.987 --> 01:31:19.866
Hang in there, pal!
You're going to make it, buddy!

01:31:37.301 --> 01:31:43.098
- Am l really your buddy?
- Yeah, sure you are!
