01:18.787 --> 01:20.122
-Hey, Jim.
-Good morning.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.086
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.590
That all you're traveling with, honey?

01:31.925 --> 01:32.926
I'm Sharon.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.696
You wear a medium?

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
Okay…

01:58.577 --> 02:02.956
Cell phone is prepaid. Somewhere on here,
it tells you the number.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.460
I was trying to think
what else to get you.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.544
It's always different with each person.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.882
Eye drops, hair spray, whatever…

02:12.382 --> 02:15.260
Last guy, he liked to use
conditioner instead of shaving cream.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.429
You just let me know what you need.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.939
Do you need me to go slower?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.341
Let me help you.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.807
There you go. Good.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.232
Well, I'm sure
you're more of an adventurer.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.695
I can't stand planes.
Don't like being up in the air

03:14.778 --> 03:17.364
and all the people
breathing down your neck.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.576
Good job, honey.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.164
All right.

03:26.665 --> 03:31.920
Now, let's stand up slowly.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.635
Bathrooms can be dangerous.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.348
Here, let me help you.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.671
Frank liked naproxen better than Advil.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.716
He had bursitis in his shoulder.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.053
He worked in the plant,
packing TV dinners.

04:22.137 --> 04:26.558
I wouldn't eat 'em. All that ammonium,
probably what got him sick.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.770
How long ago was that?

04:30.354 --> 04:31.355
Nine years.

04:32.731 --> 04:36.443
I got so good at taking care of him, I
thought, why can't I do that for a living?

04:36.527 --> 04:38.820
So I went back to school and got licensed.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.781
What a miserable life.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.123
I'm so sorry.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.586
It's okay.
People say things they don't mean.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.216
Sometimes they can't remember words.
It'll get easier.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.729
Do you remember this man's name?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.819
John Jones.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.785
Mary Black?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.253
I have no idea.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.924
Okay. And now with the other hand?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.975
You got it.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.605
Good job. It's all right. Going back.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.525
Sharon!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.403
Sharon!

06:47.449 --> 06:49.451
You're okay, honey.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.998
It's okay. Just breathe.

06:55.666 --> 06:56.750
Listen to me.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.548
It's okay. You're okay.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.677
That's it. Just breathe.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.597
In… and out.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.352
In and out.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.862
One more.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.448
You're doing great.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.496
Good. This is a big one.
They won't be like this later.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.841
Are you with me?

08:21.210 --> 08:22.211
Thank you.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.187
You wanna go for a drive
before it gets dark?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.491
Let's take this right into town.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.212
Look at you.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.342
You're ready to go.

09:26.984 --> 09:31.989
Pull over. You need to pull over
just to the side of the road. Right here.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.750
I'm sorry.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.335
It's okay.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.881
I know this is hard.

09:49.882 --> 09:54.595
This isn't hard.
Driving a car shouldn't be a victory.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.767
I mean leaving. Transition can be hard.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.856
If you're not feeling ready,
we can look into extending your stay.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.483
I can't pay for that.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.904
I should be getting back anyway.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.697
Back home.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.367
No, back to work. Redeploy.

10:22.122 --> 10:26.502
You've made a lot of progress, but you're
not ready to go back to work. Not nearly.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.964
Then what the hell was the point
in all of this?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.525
Don't forget what we talked about, okay?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.613
Organize yourself. Prep for memory gaps.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.326
Make lists. Keep your lists.
Put like with like.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.579
Find two of something,
put them together like we worked on.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.789
I'm not gonna forget.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.043
People do.
They can get a little ahead of themselves.

11:09.711 --> 11:13.257
Well, what's your plan for getting home
from the bus? We can write it down.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.178
My mom is gonna pick me up
from the bus station.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.222
Anyone else gonna be around?

11:21.431 --> 11:22.432
Your brother?

11:27.104 --> 11:30.315
I haven't really been home in a while,
and it's not like I'm staying for long.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.985
-So…
-It can help to be with people.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.153
I'm good on my own.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.622
Ativan, Depakote, Cymbalta, Vicodin.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.457
The rehab's not over.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.462
You're gonna have to work hard every day
to do all the things you used to do.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.631
Yep.

11:56.967 --> 11:57.968
I'm gonna be fine.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.568
You think you're so funny, don't you?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.486
I think it's in here. Hold on.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.823
Okay. I'll be right there. Hold on.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.534
Lynsey?

16:35.579 --> 16:38.498
Lynsey, I thought you said
you were coming on Friday.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.542
Mom?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.006
You okay?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.092
I'm fine.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.183
I asked Debbie to get off work
early Friday.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.395
I was gonna get groceries,
clean out the truck for you,

17:01.939 --> 17:05.483
get a cake, pick you up.
It was gonna be a homecoming on Friday.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.694
It's okay.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.740
Hey, you wanna meet Ted?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.367
No. I need to sleep.

17:15.493 --> 17:16.703
We'll keep it down.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.832
I gotta go to work early,
but you sleep in.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.464
Hey, Lyns.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.093
I was worried about you.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.224
You look like you.

18:42.748 --> 18:43.749
Can I help you?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.877
I was wondering if you're still hiring.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.963
-To clean pools?
-Yeah.

18:50.756 --> 18:53.300
You home for the summer? You in college?

18:55.010 --> 18:56.720
I just got back from Afghanistan.

18:57.888 --> 19:01.683
Thank you for your service.
My father was in the Navy. Korean.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.895
But why do you wanna clean pools?

19:06.522 --> 19:09.942
I like the water.
I used to clean the pools over at Newman.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.612
I guess there's not
a lot of swimming pools in Afghanistan.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.572
Not where I was. No.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.075
-Can you drive?
-Yeah.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.744
Great. Start tomorrow?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.454
Sure.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.357
Hey! Get the fuck off the road!

19:57.739 --> 20:00.033
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
Fuck.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.122
Yeah.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.501
What's this, '85 Scottsdale?

20:51.460 --> 20:55.047
Old, old body style right here.
Got you a nice truck.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.049
Yeah. Not anymore.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.301
How long it been doing this?

20:59.384 --> 21:02.304
Just now. I don't know. It's not mine.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.890
When the last time
you changed the oil in it?

21:06.683 --> 21:07.726
I don't know.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.480
All right. It's all right.

21:12.231 --> 21:13.899
Hey, Santiago.

21:15.526 --> 21:16.527
You can wait inside.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.611
We got air in there.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.697
Yeah.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.868
Yesterday, I said
it was the exhaust valve, and I was right.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.973
So-- Well, probably just the carburetor.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.058
And if it is,
I can just get that part on eBay.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.687
It ain't that hard to find. It may
take a while to get here. You in a hurry?

21:52.312 --> 21:53.981
I don't know how long I'll be here.

21:54.940 --> 21:59.486
-How much is it gonna cost?
-Maybe about 350, 400, plus labor.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.656
Maybe more if we get in there
and find it needs some more work.

22:02.739 --> 22:06.118
I don't know if I wanna fix it.
It's not even mine. It's--

22:06.201 --> 22:10.497
Oh, no, now that…
I mean, that's a nice truck.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.458
So…

22:16.503 --> 22:19.089
Okay, how about you just
leave it here with us?

22:19.173 --> 22:21.800
And when I get the part,
I'll call you for an estimate. Yeah?

22:23.302 --> 22:24.553
I don't know my number.

22:25.721 --> 22:26.930
I mean, it's just business.

22:27.681 --> 22:30.893
No. I really don't know my number.

22:36.148 --> 22:39.985
How about you-- How about this?
How about you call me,

22:40.485 --> 22:42.237
and your number will show up. Okay?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.781
Can I see your phone?

22:45.282 --> 22:47.618
So what I'ma do is I'ma call me, right?

22:48.744 --> 22:51.580
And that way, my number will show up,
all right? Simple as that.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.749
It's Aucoin.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.375
Thank you.

23:32.162 --> 23:35.290
Hey, '85 Scottsdale, you okay?

23:36.917 --> 23:37.918
I'm fine.

23:38.919 --> 23:41.046
I mean, it's real hot out.
You want a ride?

23:43.382 --> 23:44.383
Where you headed?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.218
Just down near Tchoup and Bordeaux.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.556
-Gonna get a sno-ball?
-No.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.767
Shit, maybe.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.359
Hey, you wanna play some music?

24:03.694 --> 24:05.112
You can pick whatever CD you like.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.664
My grandma used to play this record. She--

24:16.373 --> 24:18.292
Man, she loved her some Ernie.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.795
He's making a joke
out of the blues though.

24:22.379 --> 24:25.883
-You grew up here?
-Yeah, born and raised. You?

24:27.217 --> 24:28.218
Same.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.596
-Where you go to high school?
-Newman.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.642
I had a scholarship.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.895
I went to De La Salle.

24:39.855 --> 24:40.772
Aucoin, right?

24:41.773 --> 24:43.692
You know, most people,
they just call me James.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.862
I knew a Jess Aucoin
that went to De La Salle.

24:47.571 --> 24:49.031
That would be my sister.

24:49.114 --> 24:52.284
I played against her in basketball.
She was tough.

25:03.712 --> 25:04.922
The weirdest thing about this song

25:05.005 --> 25:07.424
is that he actually got buried
with his mother-in-law.

25:07.508 --> 25:08.800
Down on Claiborne.

25:09.468 --> 25:10.469
That's ironic.

25:14.056 --> 25:14.890
Shoot.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.184
I guess that's why
people don't buy CDs anymore.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.895
Know what? I'm old-school, so…

25:21.813 --> 25:22.814
Yeah.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.655
You know this one, right?

25:31.240 --> 25:34.368
-"Here Come the Girls"?
-That's it.

25:35.410 --> 25:36.411
Okay, Newman.

26:05.649 --> 26:06.650
All right.

26:07.818 --> 26:10.946
First you scrub,
then you use your skimmer.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.240
Get all your flowers and leaves
off the surface.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.367
Then you get your leaf rake.
That's the heavy net.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.995
You get all your rocks, twigs, acorns.

26:18.078 --> 26:20.581
Stuff that'll clog your main drain
and damage your pump.

26:20.664 --> 26:23.792
Hey, you okay? Can you handle all of that?

26:23.876 --> 26:25.752
Yeah. Main drain…

26:25.836 --> 26:29.423
All right, good.
So then you're gonna empty the drains.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.843
And the drains are serious.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.096
You don't know what's in those drains.

26:36.680 --> 26:40.350
You can tell a lot about a person
'cause of what's in their pool drains.

26:43.562 --> 26:46.064
You really gotta give it some more muscle.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.402
There you go.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.488
People treat their pools like shit.

26:54.573 --> 26:57.492
Out of chlorine.
Grabbing some from the truck.

27:06.001 --> 27:08.045
You think you can handle this on your own?

27:08.629 --> 27:09.505
Yes, sir.

27:09.588 --> 27:11.840
Great. Then you can start
with Octavia Street tomorrow.

27:22.559 --> 27:26.396
Just come over after then. Yes, baby.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.358
Okay. I'll see you later.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.988
You're in here. I didn't see the truck.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.074
It's at the shop.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.035
What's wrong with it?
What's it gonna cost?

27:40.118 --> 27:42.412
Don't worry about it. I'll pay for it.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.331
That's not what I meant.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.126
How you feeling?

27:49.419 --> 27:51.797
Good. Okay. I'm good.

27:52.756 --> 27:56.134
Come sit with me awhile?
I could use a drink.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.225
You tired?

28:04.434 --> 28:05.435
Yeah.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.438
Right.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.773
Hello? Anybody home?

28:52.357 --> 28:53.775
I'm back here, James.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.699
Damn, this place is nice.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.494
-I ain't gonna get shot, am I?
-Not today.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.371
Owners are out of town.

29:09.124 --> 29:10.584
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.089
-Do you wanna sit down?
-Yeah.

29:25.974 --> 29:26.975
Do you swim?

29:32.898 --> 29:34.316
Not exactly, no.

29:34.942 --> 29:38.445
-I saw it in your walk.
-I get around okay.

29:39.988 --> 29:40.989
Did you serve?

29:42.324 --> 29:45.410
No. I take it you did?

29:46.578 --> 29:48.914
Something like that. I just got back.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.250
How's it going?

29:55.128 --> 29:56.672
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:59.591 --> 30:01.093
And look straight up.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.433
And now the left.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.272
Very good.

30:15.232 --> 30:21.989
So, Ativan, Cymbalta, Depakote, Vicodin
and a brain injury.

30:23.991 --> 30:26.410
From which you appear to be recovering
extremely well.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.873
With brain injuries,
there are never any guarantees.

30:31.498 --> 30:34.418
I'm feeling pretty good.
In fact, I'd like to know

30:34.501 --> 30:38.630
what would happen
if I stopped taking the medication?

30:38.714 --> 30:43.260
You'd be a high risk of seizure, anxiety,
withdrawal and depression.

30:43.343 --> 30:44.344
I feel fine.

30:45.387 --> 30:48.599
Is it possible you feel fine
because of the Cymbalta?

30:51.351 --> 30:54.313
Could you explain to me
what caused the brain injury?

30:55.856 --> 30:56.982
Doesn't it say in there?

30:57.566 --> 31:00.235
It says, "Cerebral hemorrhage
acquired in Afghanistan

31:00.319 --> 31:02.571
from an explosion
while traveling in a vehicle."

31:03.780 --> 31:04.907
That's what caused it.

31:05.407 --> 31:08.619
But I want to hear
your account of what happened.

31:10.204 --> 31:14.791
I'm just asking to come off these meds.
I've never been medicated before,

31:14.875 --> 31:17.711
and I don't intend to be
for the rest of my life.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.671
Lynsey,
if you're looking for a neurologist

31:19.755 --> 31:23.300
who will give and take prescriptions
like candies, I'm not the guy.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.893
I work for the Army Corps of Engineers.

31:32.976 --> 31:36.647
I specialize in water systems.
I'd been deployed to work on a dam.

31:37.481 --> 31:41.902
Dam is a 20-minute drive from base.
Three-vehicle convoy.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.989
Ten minutes from base,
the lead vehicle explodes.

31:46.865 --> 31:51.286
I see it from the front window.
And then my vehicle explodes.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.958
At first I don't really know
what happened,

31:57.501 --> 32:01.755
but the guy next to me,
a sergeant, is on fire.

32:03.006 --> 32:07.427
Flames up his legs and on his chest,
and he's beating them.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.812
I can't see. I can't breathe.

32:19.147 --> 32:23.527
Eventually,
someone gets the rear door open,

32:25.237 --> 32:26.864
and some guys start getting out.

32:27.489 --> 32:31.493
I see the sunlight,
so I try to move towards it.

32:32.744 --> 32:36.874
But there's gunshots everywhere, and the
guys who are getting out are getting shot.

32:38.125 --> 32:43.297
They're just getting out, falling over.
So I can't get out.

32:45.424 --> 32:50.679
But I need to get out
because the guy next to me is on fire.

32:54.558 --> 32:57.686
Then I black out,
and I wake up in the hospital.

32:57.769 --> 33:02.191
And they told me that the detonation
caused my brain to start bleeding.

33:05.777 --> 33:08.864
Does that help your diagnosis?

33:09.531 --> 33:12.409
It does. Thank you for your candor.

33:17.581 --> 33:19.166
Tell me, how are you sleeping?

33:23.795 --> 33:24.796
Not great.

33:37.017 --> 33:38.018
Hi.

33:39.895 --> 33:40.896
Hi.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.945
You got food.

33:54.201 --> 33:56.328
Do you know how many times
I've refinanced this place?

33:56.411 --> 33:57.412
Three.

34:01.625 --> 34:06.421
I talked to Debbie.
They need someone in the office upstairs.

34:07.673 --> 34:10.634
We could take breaks together.
That might be nice.

34:12.386 --> 34:14.679
I have a job. I'm-- I got a job.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.348
You did? Doing what?

34:16.431 --> 34:17.808
Cleaning pools.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.311
What are you doing?

34:22.187 --> 34:25.148
Pools. I'm cleaning them.

34:25.232 --> 34:28.068
You'd rather work in 109-degree heat

34:28.150 --> 34:30.987
than in an air-conditioned office
in a department store?

34:31.071 --> 34:32.406
I told Debbie you'd meet with her.

34:32.489 --> 34:35.033
I told her all about you.
How smart you are. How beautiful.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.453
I can't work in an office right now.

34:38.536 --> 34:41.956
Of course you can.
It's a good job. Has insurance.

34:44.710 --> 34:47.629
I can't stare at a screen all day.

34:47.713 --> 34:49.882
Just try it.
I know it's not your dream job,

34:49.965 --> 34:51.884
but you don't wanna clean pools
forever either.

34:51.967 --> 34:54.052
It's just temporary until I can go back.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.304
What do you mean "back"?

35:01.810 --> 35:02.811
Are you kidding me?

35:04.646 --> 35:08.150
When were you gonna tell me that?
Wait, will they even take you back?

35:09.860 --> 35:12.029
-I'm gonna try.
-In the shape you're in?

35:14.323 --> 35:15.449
It's not your problem.

35:15.532 --> 35:18.118
It is my problem when I get a call
in the middle of the night

35:18.202 --> 35:21.538
from some doctor in Germany
telling me my kid got blown up.

35:21.622 --> 35:23.540
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.167
Okay, Lynsey.

35:26.710 --> 35:31.089
You're here for a visit, so visit.
How are you?

35:34.384 --> 35:35.761
I'm not feeling very well.

35:59.117 --> 36:00.702
I told you that in confidence.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.208
-Careful of that corner.
-Thanks.

36:49.418 --> 36:50.419
All right.

36:52.713 --> 36:53.714
Now this way.

37:01.889 --> 37:05.350
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.396
Hey, how much you pay for this thing?

37:09.980 --> 37:10.981
Fifty bucks.

37:12.482 --> 37:15.485
It's brutal, but I have to pass a test
to get back to work.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.404
You got to pass a test to clean pools?

37:17.988 --> 37:19.823
No. My old job.

37:22.743 --> 37:23.744
You ever use one?

37:24.620 --> 37:28.498
Went to PT a couple times.
I ain't been to the gym in a while though.

37:28.582 --> 37:29.583
Me either.

37:31.502 --> 37:33.670
-Hey, what's going on with my truck?
-What truck?

37:35.756 --> 37:37.758
Nah, things just get busy.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.928
I got this white lady. She keep calling me

37:41.011 --> 37:43.722
to help her move gym equipment
all the time. You know what I'm saying?

37:44.306 --> 37:45.557
Weird.

37:45.641 --> 37:48.268
What about you?
How the pool business going?

37:49.561 --> 37:50.562
It's cutthroat.

37:51.897 --> 37:54.316
-Really?
-No.

37:56.235 --> 37:57.236
Funny.

37:59.404 --> 38:03.033
-Just putting it right here, right?
-Yeah. That's fine.

38:03.116 --> 38:04.117
All right.

38:04.993 --> 38:07.621
Okay. Don't get all Navy SEAL
and overdo it, all right? It's hot.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.999
-I can handle the heat.
-All right.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.210
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.007
Yeah. All right.

38:21.134 --> 38:24.096
Hey, you wanna get a burger or something?

38:24.179 --> 38:28.141
Absolutely. I was gonna say the same
thing. I just didn't wanna suggest that.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.019
I didn't want to be weird or anything.
So, your treat, right?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.272
-I wasn't thinking that…
-All right.

38:33.355 --> 38:34.481
I mean, I did just move…

38:34.982 --> 38:36.358
a rowing machine for you.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.405
Hey, you tell him I said hey?

38:42.447 --> 38:44.658
Yeah. You know I will.

38:45.951 --> 38:47.119
That's on me, James.

38:47.202 --> 38:48.996
What you talking about, sugar?
It's always on you.

38:49.079 --> 38:50.080
Not always.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.086
-Thanks.
-Yeah. She went to school with my mama.

39:00.799 --> 39:03.218
-So you really don't drink at all?
-Huh?

39:03.927 --> 39:05.470
You really don't drink at all?

39:06.346 --> 39:07.347
I haven't tried.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.224
You ain't never tried a beer?

39:09.308 --> 39:13.020
No. Not since I've been back.
I'm kind of on a lot of medication.

39:15.814 --> 39:16.899
What kind of medication?

39:18.275 --> 39:20.861
Like, "don't-shoot-yourself-in-the-head"
kind of medication.

39:21.737 --> 39:22.738
Okay.

39:24.114 --> 39:27.826
You mean like pain pills?
Crazy pills? Happy pills?

39:28.452 --> 39:30.287
So far, just pain and crazy.

39:31.205 --> 39:32.998
-Hey, can I buy you a beer?
-What?

39:33.081 --> 39:35.584
You are really beautiful.
Can I buy you a beer?

39:36.084 --> 39:38.378
-I'm okay. Thank you.
-Come on. Have a beer with me.

39:38.462 --> 39:40.589
You're in a bar drinking root beer.
We're in New Orleans.

39:40.672 --> 39:42.090
I think she said no, bro.

39:43.759 --> 39:45.469
Hey, I'll buy you a beer too, bro.

39:45.552 --> 39:47.262
Deaf and blind.

39:47.346 --> 39:49.681
No, because I already got a beer.

39:50.182 --> 39:53.477
And, you know, my girl said no.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.605
I'm not picking up that vibe.
Are you his girl?

39:57.231 --> 39:58.941
I'm really sorry. I have a boyfriend.

39:59.441 --> 40:02.069
Wait. So she's your girl,
and she has a boyfriend?

40:02.152 --> 40:06.281
Yeah, that's exactly right. She my girl,
and she got a boyfriend.

40:07.074 --> 40:08.825
That okay with you, bro?

40:10.327 --> 40:13.121
-Don't shoot me for trying.
-Hey, you have a good night.

40:14.540 --> 40:15.541
Stupid.

40:16.416 --> 40:19.127
Look, I know you're not my girl.

40:19.211 --> 40:21.463
-Do you know what I mean? I mean, I--
-It's fine.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.674
All right.

40:26.426 --> 40:27.886
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

40:28.470 --> 40:29.555
I don't have a boyfriend.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.432
Are you with anybody?

40:34.351 --> 40:35.352
Nah.

40:37.104 --> 40:39.523
I was engaged. Once.

40:40.816 --> 40:42.234
What happened?

40:44.528 --> 40:45.529
Lost my leg.

40:54.496 --> 40:56.081
Can I try a sip of your beer?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.752
-You sure?
-Yeah.

41:16.727 --> 41:18.770
-Thanks.
-Yeah. Last one.

41:32.618 --> 41:33.702
I wanted to say

41:33.785 --> 41:36.455
that thing
about me not having a boyfriend--

41:36.538 --> 41:39.583
-Hey. Look. Nah, I just--
-No. Well, let me just--

41:42.336 --> 41:45.339
I don't have boyfriends.
I have girlfriends.

41:46.340 --> 41:51.136
I mean, not right now,
but when I do, that's what I have.

41:52.596 --> 41:55.557
-Okay. I wasn't--
-No, I know what you were doing,

41:55.641 --> 41:57.017
and I really appreciate it.

41:57.518 --> 42:02.523
I'm just telling you that
because now you know that about me.

42:06.401 --> 42:12.032
Okay. Well… Okay. It's cool.

42:15.494 --> 42:18.997
-Thank you?
-You're welcome.

42:20.374 --> 42:22.960
It's all good.

42:34.221 --> 42:36.056
You know, I've never actually tried weed.

42:36.974 --> 42:37.975
Are you serious?

42:38.809 --> 42:40.978
I mean, my brother did enough drugs
for the both of us.

42:41.478 --> 42:42.479
Yeah?

42:44.523 --> 42:47.651
Crack, meth, household detergent.

42:49.319 --> 42:53.198
Some alchemy he read online.
Didn't work. Burned his lung.

42:53.949 --> 42:54.950
Damn.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.624
-What happened to your leg?
-Sheesh.

43:02.708 --> 43:06.211
-I really didn't see that coming.
-Well, what happened to it?

43:12.217 --> 43:13.594
I was in a car accident.

43:17.598 --> 43:20.559
I got in a car accident with Jess…

43:22.561 --> 43:26.398
and her son, my nephew, Antoine.

43:27.357 --> 43:28.442
On the Causeway.

43:31.820 --> 43:35.574
I remember… looking in my rearview mirror,

43:36.074 --> 43:38.493
and I could see Jess's face.

43:40.829 --> 43:43.081
I just remember looking in her eyes.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.503
It was like she was saying bye.

43:48.462 --> 43:49.463
Like,

43:51.173 --> 43:52.341
"See you later."

43:55.093 --> 43:57.471
And then, I kind of wake up.

43:57.554 --> 43:59.806
And I just feel this pressing into me,

43:59.890 --> 44:03.018
like this really hard, hard pressing.
Really hard.

44:03.101 --> 44:06.522
And it turns out
the car was bent out of shape.

44:07.898 --> 44:08.899
And I'm bent with it.

44:10.526 --> 44:11.527
And this leg…

44:12.319 --> 44:18.534
this leg is so fucked up
that I could look down

44:18.617 --> 44:21.245
and the sole of my shoe
is looking right back at me.

44:21.328 --> 44:25.249
And then there's these people
screaming outside the car.

44:29.002 --> 44:30.003
Not inside.

44:32.923 --> 44:33.924
Did Jess die?

44:37.302 --> 44:38.303
Nah.

44:41.348 --> 44:42.599
Nah, not Jess.

44:45.644 --> 44:46.895
I'm so sorry.

44:52.109 --> 44:53.110
Yep.

45:30.689 --> 45:32.274
Hey, you good?

45:40.407 --> 45:44.119
Hey, look, if it get dark,
now, you just ride it. Okay?

45:44.953 --> 45:45.954
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.625
How do I do that?

45:51.376 --> 45:55.380
That's-- All right. What's dark?

45:56.465 --> 45:57.466
Being back here.

45:58.717 --> 46:00.552
So you don't got love for this city?

46:00.636 --> 46:02.221
It's not the city.

46:02.304 --> 46:03.514
Then what is it?

46:06.183 --> 46:07.184
It's that house.

46:08.477 --> 46:11.021
So many nights
sitting at that kitchen table,

46:11.104 --> 46:12.814
and my brother would be nodding off.

46:12.898 --> 46:18.445
And my mom would say,
"Poor thing. He's so tired."

46:19.988 --> 46:20.989
I miss him.

46:24.201 --> 46:26.620
He and I were both trapped in that house.

46:28.789 --> 46:30.541
But I'm the only one that made it out.

46:35.087 --> 46:37.798
Anyway. And then I just
never thought I would come back here.

46:39.174 --> 46:40.634
But then I got blown up.

46:40.717 --> 46:42.719
You got-- What? You got blown up?

46:43.595 --> 46:44.596
IED.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.206
Oh, shit!

47:53.624 --> 47:54.625
Thank you.

48:06.261 --> 48:07.262
Okay. Well…

48:10.641 --> 48:11.642
What's the rush?

48:19.483 --> 48:20.526
You in a rush?

48:21.276 --> 48:22.277
No.

48:23.529 --> 48:24.530
Me neither.

48:25.531 --> 48:26.532
Thanks.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.228
It's a nice house.

48:57.646 --> 48:58.647
Big.

48:59.147 --> 49:02.401
Yeah. It's too big for me. You think?

49:04.278 --> 49:06.071
I got nothing against big houses.

49:08.657 --> 49:10.701
Yeah. It was the family home.

49:11.451 --> 49:12.452
You grew up here?

49:12.536 --> 49:14.037
No.

49:14.872 --> 49:18.208
Me and Jess bought it… after my mama died.

49:19.877 --> 49:22.379
Just… living here together.

49:23.755 --> 49:29.261
Three years of me, her, Antoine.

49:32.556 --> 49:33.557
It was…

49:48.113 --> 49:49.114
Good.

49:54.244 --> 49:55.412
You stayed?

49:56.580 --> 49:58.081
Jess moved out, and I--

50:00.501 --> 50:02.336
Yeah, I did. I stayed.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.637
My mom stayed in the house we all shared.

50:13.096 --> 50:14.515
She's the only one left.

50:14.598 --> 50:16.475
I don't know what you're talking about.

50:19.853 --> 50:22.481
I don't think it's healthy. Staying.

50:23.815 --> 50:26.944
For her? Or for me?

50:31.031 --> 50:32.032
Actually, me.

50:42.042 --> 50:46.421
You know
you don't have to live with your mother.

50:50.133 --> 50:51.385
Could move in here.

50:52.135 --> 50:53.136
What?

50:53.720 --> 50:54.930
Yeah, move in.

50:55.764 --> 50:57.140
You got your own room.

50:57.641 --> 51:00.769
You know how many rooms I got?
I wouldn't even know you was here.

51:04.731 --> 51:05.732
I don't think that's--

51:05.816 --> 51:08.819
I'm not hitting on you
or nothing. I'm just--

51:09.945 --> 51:12.865
I know. But you're drunk.

51:13.907 --> 51:14.908
That's true.

51:20.497 --> 51:23.000
It would just be nice
to have someone around.

51:26.336 --> 51:29.047
Have coffee together in the morning.

51:29.590 --> 51:31.466
You know, smoke in the evening.

51:33.844 --> 51:35.220
Cook together sometimes.

51:39.683 --> 51:41.018
It's what we used to do.

51:54.865 --> 51:55.866
Hey.

51:57.618 --> 51:58.785
It's whatever.

52:04.625 --> 52:05.626
Thank you for the ride.

52:06.251 --> 52:07.252
Sure.

52:42.246 --> 52:43.539
Please don't judge me.

52:44.164 --> 52:45.457
I'm not judging you.

52:48.544 --> 52:49.545
Where you been?

52:50.045 --> 52:51.046
Out with a friend.

52:51.672 --> 52:52.881
Have you been drinking?

52:54.258 --> 52:55.634
A little, maybe.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.261
Lynsey.

52:58.220 --> 53:00.055
I thought you were the responsible one.

53:00.138 --> 53:01.932
I am the responsible one.

53:02.516 --> 53:04.518
Just don't turn into your aunt Leslie.

53:05.018 --> 53:07.646
Or anyone from my family.

53:08.605 --> 53:10.023
Or your father's side.

53:11.358 --> 53:12.359
Okay, Mom.

53:13.026 --> 53:14.278
You hungry?

53:14.361 --> 53:16.113
I just had a burger.

53:16.196 --> 53:17.364
"I just had a burger."

53:20.826 --> 53:25.455
You used to be the funniest little kid,
then you became so serious.

53:32.004 --> 53:33.255
You're probably tired.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.051
You got work tomorrow?

53:41.847 --> 53:42.890
This is luxury.

53:55.402 --> 53:56.778
So, what are your doctors saying?

53:57.279 --> 53:59.072
My next appointment's on the 22nd.

54:01.450 --> 54:02.618
I'll drive you.

54:03.452 --> 54:04.828
You don't have to do that.

54:04.912 --> 54:08.165
No, I wanna. They treat you better
if you have someone with you.

54:08.248 --> 54:11.335
They know somebody cares about you,
so you must not be too awful.

54:12.753 --> 54:16.089
-You sure?
-Yes! Is it that unbelievable?

54:16.173 --> 54:17.174
Sorry.

54:18.509 --> 54:19.510
Thank you.

54:20.552 --> 54:23.388
Aren't your tits sweating?
Get your ass in this pool.

54:24.556 --> 54:26.725
It's good for you. It'll relax you.

54:33.857 --> 54:35.442
Geez, don't get in all at once.

55:09.351 --> 55:10.352
What?

55:12.187 --> 55:13.856
Why did you go so far away?

55:16.900 --> 55:18.235
I don't know. I wanted to.

55:19.444 --> 55:22.489
But why? Why'd you wanna?

55:25.200 --> 55:26.368
A lot of reasons.

55:29.496 --> 55:30.664
Any you want to share?

55:32.833 --> 55:33.834
No.

55:39.548 --> 55:41.049
You just couldn't stand it here?

55:46.388 --> 55:47.639
You can tell me the truth.

55:51.185 --> 55:52.186
No, I couldn't.

56:00.736 --> 56:03.071
When I was your age,
I couldn't stay in one place either.

56:05.365 --> 56:06.366
I get you.

56:11.246 --> 56:12.247
I really do.

56:32.976 --> 56:34.561
Time for a refill.

56:54.706 --> 56:57.042
Hello? Hello, Ted.

56:58.210 --> 57:00.379
Well, that's my voice.
That's what it sounds like.

57:02.548 --> 57:07.094
No. I'm busy.
I'm having a night with my daughter.

57:07.594 --> 57:08.595
How was your night?

57:12.140 --> 57:13.267
Don't be cute.

57:16.353 --> 57:18.856
Well, you're an idiot
'cause I don't want to see you.

57:22.526 --> 57:23.527
Really?

57:25.612 --> 57:27.573
Hold on a minute.
Let me move to the bedroom.

57:29.074 --> 57:30.576
No, I'm not doing anything.

59:47.212 --> 59:50.591
Hey. Thank you. I'm so sorry.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.092
Don't be sorry. It's cool.

59:53.218 --> 59:55.220
Stupid to think I could depend on her.

59:55.304 --> 59:56.972
She let you down a lot?

59:57.055 --> 1:00:00.100
Yeah. Somehow it still surprises me.

1:00:02.603 --> 1:00:05.272
It's all good. Come on, we got time.

1:00:05.856 --> 1:00:08.734
Probably even got time to get you
that sno-ball you ain't get the other day.

1:00:08.817 --> 1:00:09.985
You think?

1:00:10.068 --> 1:00:11.320
It's on me.

1:00:21.830 --> 1:00:22.831
Good.

1:00:25.542 --> 1:00:26.543
Thank you.

1:00:26.627 --> 1:00:27.711
You're welcome.

1:00:28.670 --> 1:00:30.589
-Is that vanilla?
-Oh, yeah.

1:00:31.924 --> 1:00:33.425
What? Something wrong with vanilla?

1:00:33.509 --> 1:00:36.845
I just didn't even know they made vanilla.

1:00:36.929 --> 1:00:38.847
Well, you got a whole rainbow in your cup.

1:00:38.931 --> 1:00:40.432
Yeah, that's the point.

1:00:43.185 --> 1:00:44.811
Hey, it's all right.
I'll get you another one.

1:00:44.895 --> 1:00:46.313
-No, I don't want--
-I got enough--

1:00:46.396 --> 1:00:49.816
No, I don't want another sno-ball.
I wanna not fucking drop shit.

1:00:53.612 --> 1:00:54.613
Sorry.

1:00:56.114 --> 1:00:57.908
So, you drop shit. What's that about?

1:00:57.991 --> 1:01:00.869
I still have a few glitches
from the accident.

1:01:02.246 --> 1:01:04.081
So that's what the doctor for?
Fixing that?

1:01:04.164 --> 1:01:06.124
No. I mean, I'm fixed.

1:01:15.843 --> 1:01:17.052
Okay.

1:01:25.519 --> 1:01:26.520
Say it.

1:01:28.188 --> 1:01:29.189
It's good.

1:01:31.149 --> 1:01:33.277
So, this doctor you going to,
you just going for fun?

1:01:35.279 --> 1:01:37.531
No, I need him to clear me,
so I can go back.

1:01:39.116 --> 1:01:41.326
You got blown up over there,
and you wanna go back?

1:01:42.536 --> 1:01:44.079
I just have to get out of here.

1:01:47.249 --> 1:01:49.793
And all I need is this guy
to sign a piece of paper.

1:02:03.432 --> 1:02:04.975
We'll get you another sno-ball.

1:02:05.517 --> 1:02:08.020
I see you eyeing mine
and I ain't sharing it no more.

1:02:09.563 --> 1:02:12.232
Look, I got enough cash
to cover you for two more.

1:02:12.316 --> 1:02:14.234
After that, you on your own.

1:02:17.613 --> 1:02:19.656
How y'all doing? Aight. That good.

1:02:20.365 --> 1:02:21.783
-Headache?
-No.

1:02:22.451 --> 1:02:23.952
-Sleeping?
-Great.

1:02:24.953 --> 1:02:26.330
Mood?

1:02:27.664 --> 1:02:31.001
Fine. Yeah. I'm good.

1:02:36.048 --> 1:02:39.301
I was actually thinking,
it's time for me to go back.

1:02:40.552 --> 1:02:41.678
To the military?

1:02:42.179 --> 1:02:43.680
Redeploy. Yes.

1:02:44.932 --> 1:02:47.476
You honestly feel
you have a clean bill of health?

1:02:47.559 --> 1:02:50.771
Yes. I have my post-deployment screening,

1:02:51.313 --> 1:02:55.692
my hearing test, my vision test,
my scans from Nebraska.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:57.361
What's left?

1:02:57.444 --> 1:03:01.031
Possible risk of reinjury,
compounding the TBI,

1:03:01.114 --> 1:03:03.242
and, above all, your mental health.

1:03:03.325 --> 1:03:08.247
Well, that's my risk to take,
and I told you, I feel fine.

1:03:09.665 --> 1:03:12.125
Lynsey, smoking is linked to lung cancer.

1:03:12.209 --> 1:03:15.212
Extreme trauma is linked to PTSD
and depression.

1:03:15.295 --> 1:03:16.964
In fact, the link is stronger.

1:03:17.464 --> 1:03:19.758
I'm not ready to sign a waiver.

1:03:20.384 --> 1:03:22.469
I'm the one that has to be ready.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:25.138
It's both of us.

1:03:39.570 --> 1:03:41.113
I really appreciate today.

1:03:42.614 --> 1:03:43.615
Sure.

1:03:45.784 --> 1:03:48.245
I'm not working tomorrow.
Do you wanna come by in the afternoon?

1:03:50.539 --> 1:03:51.623
Tomorrow afternoon?

1:03:52.124 --> 1:03:53.125
You working?

1:03:54.042 --> 1:03:55.961
I make the schedule, so…

1:03:57.254 --> 1:04:01.175
Well, we could go to that pool on Octavia.
The owners are still out of town.

1:04:01.258 --> 1:04:06.180
Well, I'm not much of a swimmer, so…

1:04:07.598 --> 1:04:09.016
We could just get high.

1:04:10.893 --> 1:04:11.894
Yeah, that could work.

1:04:14.563 --> 1:04:15.731
It's on me.

1:04:15.814 --> 1:04:16.982
Okay.

1:05:06.365 --> 1:05:07.366
Okay.

1:05:10.077 --> 1:05:11.453
We're gonna get in this pool now.

1:05:12.913 --> 1:05:15.791
Nah. I'm still cool.

1:05:17.209 --> 1:05:19.002
Come on. We gotta go swimming.

1:05:21.088 --> 1:05:22.506
Owners are back next week.

1:05:40.399 --> 1:05:41.775
Feels so good.

1:05:43.527 --> 1:05:44.528
Come on.

1:05:49.491 --> 1:05:50.659
Yes.

1:06:51.512 --> 1:06:53.138
I can't believe you actually got in.

1:06:53.222 --> 1:06:54.223
Yeah.

1:07:10.072 --> 1:07:12.658
Damn. How long was that?

1:07:13.283 --> 1:07:15.244
I used to practice holding my breath
as a kid.

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:18.038
What's the longest you've ever held it?

1:07:19.164 --> 1:07:20.207
Twenty-six years.

1:07:21.083 --> 1:07:22.793
I got you beat by four years.

1:07:25.587 --> 1:07:27.714
-Challenge me to a race?
-You sure about that?

1:07:27.798 --> 1:07:28.882
You count it off.

1:07:28.966 --> 1:07:31.218
-Three, two, one.
-Two, one.

1:07:31.301 --> 1:07:32.344
What the fuck?

1:07:37.558 --> 1:07:38.559
Oh, shit.

1:07:39.434 --> 1:07:40.435
Michael Phelps!

1:07:42.062 --> 1:07:43.480
You didn't even try.

1:07:43.564 --> 1:07:45.858
Well, it ain't like I got
a propeller on this thing?

1:08:06.962 --> 1:08:08.672
I feel like I lied to you.

1:08:10.674 --> 1:08:11.675
When?

1:08:13.594 --> 1:08:15.262
When I told you about the accident.

1:08:17.723 --> 1:08:20.267
-Lied how?
-Well, not lied.

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:23.520
I left something out.

1:08:25.354 --> 1:08:28.649
I wasn't really clear,
and it's the same thing.

1:08:29.984 --> 1:08:31.987
'Cause you didn't say
that you were driving?

1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:35.741
Yeah.

1:08:38.243 --> 1:08:40.787
You said you saw Jess
in the rearview mirror,

1:08:40.871 --> 1:08:42.581
so I kind of figured.

1:08:50.671 --> 1:08:51.715
Antoine--

1:08:54.676 --> 1:08:56.178
He was sitting next to me.

1:08:58.388 --> 1:09:00.098
He was in the passenger seat.

1:09:01.390 --> 1:09:04.937
Kept saying he wanted to sit next to me
in the front seat, so…

1:09:07.648 --> 1:09:09.149
And Jess said no,

1:09:10.901 --> 1:09:14.696
that he was too small and that he
needed to be in the child seat.

1:09:18.116 --> 1:09:19.451
And I said yes.

1:09:23.412 --> 1:09:24.665
I said yes.

1:09:29.670 --> 1:09:32.171
I thought I was supposed to say yes
to shit like that.

1:09:36.635 --> 1:09:38.095
Give him what he asks for.

1:09:42.099 --> 1:09:43.100
Spoil him.

1:09:43.809 --> 1:09:45.935
-You see--
-I do.

1:09:46.019 --> 1:09:49.606
-No, I--
-No, you don't need to say anything.

1:10:27.895 --> 1:10:29.396
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

1:10:32.149 --> 1:10:33.483
Why'd you do it then?

1:10:36.278 --> 1:10:37.988
I just felt so bad for you.

1:10:44.870 --> 1:10:49.583
No. James, come back.

1:11:00.385 --> 1:11:03.388
James. Don't go.

1:11:07.017 --> 1:11:08.143
You felt bad for me?

1:11:08.852 --> 1:11:12.606
-I'm sorry. I didn't--
-I got enough people feeling bad for me.

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:17.611
That's not how I meant it.

1:11:17.694 --> 1:11:18.946
Then what'd you mean?

1:11:20.822 --> 1:11:23.784
Yeah, you don't know. What is this?

1:11:25.202 --> 1:11:26.453
What is what?

1:11:26.537 --> 1:11:28.705
What are we doing here? Huh?

1:11:31.959 --> 1:11:37.214
I pick you up, I drop you off,
and I buy you sno-balls, huh?

1:11:37.714 --> 1:11:41.009
Tell you something,
you want a driver, call a fucking taxi.

1:11:41.093 --> 1:11:42.177
What you want from me?

1:11:42.845 --> 1:11:45.055
So I don't want to fuck you,
now you don't want to be friends?

1:11:45.138 --> 1:11:46.390
Okay, I want to fuck you.

1:11:46.473 --> 1:11:48.100
I want to fuck you,
but you just kissed me.

1:11:48.183 --> 1:11:50.811
You really need to figure your shit out.
I don't even understand you.

1:11:50.894 --> 1:11:53.856
Actually, I don't know shit about you,
but I tell you what I do know. Facts.

1:11:53.939 --> 1:11:56.859
You blew up in Afghanistan
or Iraq or wherever the fuck it was.

1:11:56.942 --> 1:11:59.319
You played basketball
with my sister. Yeah.

1:11:59.403 --> 1:12:02.489
-And you got a dead brother…
-I don't have a dead brother.

1:12:03.073 --> 1:12:03.991
What'd you say?

1:12:04.074 --> 1:12:05.784
When did I say I have a dead brother?

1:12:06.368 --> 1:12:11.123
He was. You miss him. You had.
Past tense. He always past tense.

1:12:11.206 --> 1:12:12.833
-He's in prison.
-What?

1:12:12.916 --> 1:12:14.835
He's a junkie and a dealer.

1:12:15.460 --> 1:12:17.796
-You made me think he was dead.
-No.

1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:21.008
Yeah, you did. 'Cause you only
talk about him like he dead.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:25.179
Maybe that's how it feels.
Why does it fucking matter to you?

1:12:25.262 --> 1:12:26.471
That is bullshit.

1:12:27.055 --> 1:12:30.184
You want people to think he gone so
they don't know you left his ass for dead.

1:12:30.267 --> 1:12:32.060
You don't know shit about it or about me.

1:12:32.144 --> 1:12:32.978
Okay.

1:12:33.061 --> 1:12:35.564
Did you just assume we were the same,
broken people wallowing in it?

1:12:35.647 --> 1:12:37.107
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you.

1:12:38.734 --> 1:12:40.861
You think I lied about my brother?
What about you?

1:12:41.361 --> 1:12:44.448
You let your nephew ride in the front seat
that night. What else did you leave out?

1:12:46.241 --> 1:12:47.242
Were you drinking?

1:12:49.411 --> 1:12:50.579
Were you drinking?

1:13:04.676 --> 1:13:06.678
I'd had two beers.

1:13:11.808 --> 1:13:13.352
What's your excuse though?

1:13:16.355 --> 1:13:19.942
How you treat your friends, your family--

1:13:20.859 --> 1:13:24.404
Everybody there, just to be escaped from.
Just to be left behind.

1:13:25.113 --> 1:13:27.533
Like they let you down
instead of the other way around.

1:15:35.619 --> 1:15:36.662
And the other.

1:15:46.755 --> 1:15:48.090
I would like to go back.

1:15:50.175 --> 1:15:52.177
It's a very hard judgment call.

1:15:53.428 --> 1:15:55.347
I understand why you would think that.

1:15:55.848 --> 1:16:00.018
Do I still have any trace of my injury?
I'm sure.

1:16:00.686 --> 1:16:05.524
But am I going to be a risk to anybody,
unable to carry out my duties? No.

1:16:06.233 --> 1:16:07.901
I want to go where I'm useful.

1:16:08.610 --> 1:16:11.238
Can you go back? Yes.

1:16:12.281 --> 1:16:16.243
Should you go back?
It's a different question.

1:16:16.827 --> 1:16:19.580
You said the link between trauma
and depression is stronger

1:16:19.663 --> 1:16:21.707
than the link between smoking and cancer.

1:16:21.790 --> 1:16:23.125
Much stronger.

1:16:25.043 --> 1:16:27.254
What if Afghanistan
wasn't the only trauma?

1:16:29.548 --> 1:16:30.549
What then?

1:16:38.932 --> 1:16:42.227
Okay, Lynsey. I'll sign the waiver.

1:17:38.367 --> 1:17:39.993
It's James. Leave a message.

1:18:01.890 --> 1:18:05.018
You're all set. Bring it back
if it gives you any problems.

1:18:05.102 --> 1:18:07.354
Thanks. Is James in?

1:18:07.437 --> 1:18:09.815
Not today. No.

1:18:12.985 --> 1:18:14.695
All right.
Well, how much do I owe you guys?

1:18:15.195 --> 1:18:16.780
Didn't James tell you? It's free.

1:18:17.322 --> 1:18:18.323
What?

1:18:19.074 --> 1:18:21.076
Yeah, he said you were in the Army
or something.

1:19:33.565 --> 1:19:35.692
It's you.

1:19:35.776 --> 1:19:37.361
You're alive.

1:19:38.529 --> 1:19:40.822
Yeah I'm alive.

1:19:42.658 --> 1:19:44.451
It's been a long time.

1:19:46.828 --> 1:19:49.790
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

1:19:52.334 --> 1:19:56.547
Don't worry. Mom hasn't come
to see me since sentencing.

1:19:56.630 --> 1:19:58.006
Really?

1:19:58.590 --> 1:19:59.675
Yeah.

1:20:00.384 --> 1:20:01.468
Is she okay?

1:20:02.886 --> 1:20:04.012
She's fine.

1:20:04.596 --> 1:20:08.141
I worry about her.

1:20:08.225 --> 1:20:10.644
She wrote me a letter.

1:20:12.229 --> 1:20:14.481
Seems like she's having a hard time.

1:20:16.191 --> 1:20:20.821
Mom can take care of herself.

1:20:22.489 --> 1:20:23.907
How are you?

1:20:24.908 --> 1:20:27.035
I'm good.

1:20:27.870 --> 1:20:30.873
You know. I'm comfortable.

1:20:32.249 --> 1:20:34.251
Are you healthy?

1:20:39.047 --> 1:20:41.341
Am I healthy?

1:20:41.884 --> 1:20:44.595
I've been trying to gain some weight.

1:20:45.262 --> 1:20:47.764
I've got some friends in here.

1:20:49.141 --> 1:20:51.643
There's not much to do.

1:20:52.144 --> 1:20:54.521
So I've been trying to go to the gym.

1:21:01.862 --> 1:21:03.572
Honestly…

1:21:05.032 --> 1:21:08.160
I'm better off in here.

1:21:17.878 --> 1:21:20.339
I'm safe here.

1:21:20.422 --> 1:21:24.635
Out there, I don't trust myself.

1:21:31.934 --> 1:21:35.020
Enough about me.

1:21:35.854 --> 1:21:38.106
How are you?

1:21:41.777 --> 1:21:43.904
I'm good.

1:21:46.198 --> 1:21:47.950
I got hurt.

1:21:51.703 --> 1:21:54.122
But…

1:21:57.334 --> 1:21:59.378
I'm okay.

1:22:05.092 --> 1:22:08.595
I'm really sorry.

1:22:13.016 --> 1:22:17.020
I'm not sad for me.

1:22:21.441 --> 1:22:25.487
I'm just sorry too.

1:22:38.292 --> 1:22:40.210
I miss you.

1:22:40.794 --> 1:22:42.379
I miss you.

1:24:44.418 --> 1:24:45.419
What's going on?

1:24:47.337 --> 1:24:48.964
I know that truck ain't break down.

1:24:51.216 --> 1:24:54.970
Truck's fine. Thanks for that.
You didn't have to do that.

1:24:57.055 --> 1:24:58.265
So, what you doing here?

1:25:05.314 --> 1:25:10.569
You asked me if I wanted to move in,
remember?

1:25:13.071 --> 1:25:14.072
No.

1:25:19.578 --> 1:25:20.579
I remember.

1:25:38.263 --> 1:25:39.932
Would you wanna make the offer again?

1:25:47.231 --> 1:25:49.608
It would be good to have someone around.

1:25:50.692 --> 1:25:54.530
Have coffee with in the morning.
Smoke in the evening.

1:25:55.739 --> 1:25:57.241
Cook dinner sometimes.

1:26:00.619 --> 1:26:02.037
And what's that supposed to mean?

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:05.707
They're all things you said.

1:26:11.672 --> 1:26:12.714
So…

1:26:16.677 --> 1:26:17.678
you're not leaving?

1:26:19.847 --> 1:26:23.267
I don't think so. Not now, at least.

1:26:36.321 --> 1:26:37.322
And…

1:26:39.157 --> 1:26:40.617
I'm trying to make a friend.
