02:24.687 --> 02:27.106
<i>You lost your adolescent already?</i>

02:27.898 --> 02:30.317
<i>This will complicate matters...</i>

02:31.569 --> 02:33.779
<i>A young one is on the way,</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:38.534
<i>but the mother will be harder to control
without a nestling around.</i>

03:20.117 --> 03:22.036
Mr. König.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.483
Good afternoon.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.071
Good afternoon, Mr. König.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.570
I'm sorry.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.482
<i>Hello. It's nice to meet you.</i>

05:57.107 --> 05:58.692
The pleasure is all mine.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.031
<i>Yes.</i>
- "Yes", she says!

13:22.469 --> 13:23.553
Can I go now?

13:23.678 --> 13:24.554
No.

13:24.679 --> 13:29.142
You can help me teach Gretchen
how to sell things in the shop.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.016
I'm so sorry.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.851
No problem.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.682
Good luck tonight!

22:29.807 --> 22:33.394
<i>Beatrix, why are you still at the hotel?
I can see the light from...</i>

24:53.159 --> 24:55.661
Yes, okay. Call me back.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.209
Damn it.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.755
Shit.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.844
Where are you?

25:54.345 --> 25:57.682
Where are you? Come here.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.128
<i>Yes?</i>

27:11.172 --> 27:13.132
<i>Yes, yes, I'm coming.</i>

27:29.398 --> 27:31.442
<i>I told you I'm coming!</i>

43:01.413 --> 43:03.873
That's very cool.

43:07.127 --> 43:09.087
No, it's not.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.755
What are you doing here?

45:58.089 --> 45:59.924
What do you think? You imbecile!

46:00.049 --> 46:02.552
We can't, not here.
We're leaving. Now!

46:02.677 --> 46:05.722
Why? I'm cleaning
this fuck-pad all the time!

46:14.189 --> 46:15.565
I beg you!

46:18.234 --> 46:20.737
You'll have to make it up to me.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.073
I promise.

46:27.869 --> 46:29.496
Okay, fine.

46:31.998 --> 46:34.375
Let me dry my hair, then we can go.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.432
I know how you can make it up to me!

47:59.669 --> 48:03.047
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

48:15.602 --> 48:18.980
Erik, I know
how you can make it up to me!

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:41.878
<i>No, no! Stay focused!</i>

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.666
That's enough for today.

01:05:40.312 --> 01:05:41.647
Come here.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:11.134
It is always something of a confirmation
of my dreams and good intentions.

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:53.570
I told him, not in the house.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.218
Stay here.

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:37.614
No!

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:16.111
Everything's fine.

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:20.365
Everything's fine.

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:05.103
We're in the middle of an experiment.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:07.605
<i>What happened? You're bleeding.</i>

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:11.234
The recordings you made
behind my back...

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:14.612
Are they still under the staircase
at your house?

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.873
I'm sorry, Danielle.

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:41.173
Mr. König!

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:53.847
I'm sorry.

01:29:58.352 --> 01:30:05.109
I would never hurt you.

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:17.996
We have to leave now.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.767
My mom called.

01:30:47.276 --> 01:30:52.156
She got your message.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.791
Will she come to visit?
