Master Li is here!

01:10.162 --> 01:13.332
WOMAN: Shu Lien! Shu Lien!

01:16.043 --> 01:18.670
Shu Lien! Li Mu Bai is here!

01:24.217 --> 01:25.969
Welcome back, Master Li.

01:26.386 --> 01:29.264
- LI: How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.195
I can't believed you are here.
It's been too long.

01:43.278 --> 01:44.696
It has.

01:44.780 --> 01:47.115
- How's business?
- Good.

01:47.199 --> 01:49.034
- And how are you?
- Fine.

01:53.705 --> 01:56.249
Monk Zheng said
you were at Wudan Mountain.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.961
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

02:01.213 --> 02:04.800
The mountain must be so peaceful.
I envy you.

02:04.883 --> 02:08.053
My work keeps me so busy,
I hardly get any rest.

02:10.222 --> 02:13.141
I left the training early.

02:14.434 --> 02:17.938
Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
Training is everything.

02:19.022 --> 02:24.736
During my meditation training,
I came to a place of deep silence.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.948
I was surrounded by light.

02:28.657 --> 02:31.576
Time and space disappeared.

02:32.995 --> 02:37.082
I had come to a place my master
had never told me about.

02:39.543 --> 02:41.169
You were enlightened.

02:41.253 --> 02:42.713
No.

02:43.255 --> 02:46.675
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightenment.

02:46.758 --> 02:47.968
Instead...

02:48.927 --> 02:51.096
...I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

02:52.597 --> 02:55.308
I couldn't bear it.

02:56.101 --> 02:59.229
I broke off my meditation.
I couldn't go on.

03:00.564 --> 03:04.026
There was something
pulling me back.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.112
What was it?

03:10.282 --> 03:12.492
Something I can't let go of.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.622
You're leaving soon?

03:19.332 --> 03:23.295
We're preparing a convoy
for a delivery to Peking.

03:24.004 --> 03:28.008
Perhaps I could ask you
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.475
The Green Destiny Sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

03:36.558 --> 03:40.103
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

03:40.187 --> 03:43.148
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

03:43.231 --> 03:45.609
It has always been with you.

03:46.777 --> 03:49.362
Too many men have died at its edge.

03:53.784 --> 03:55.577
It only looks pure

03:55.744 --> 03:58.246
because blood
washes so easily from its blade.

03:58.538 --> 04:02.417
You use it justly. You're worthy of it.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.214
It's time for me to leave it behind.

04:08.256 --> 04:10.675
So, what will you do now?

04:13.804 --> 04:15.806
Come with me to Peking.

04:16.180 --> 04:19.142
You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.894
It'll be just like old times.

04:23.522 --> 04:26.942
First, I must visit my master's grave.

04:27.776 --> 04:29.861
It's been many years...

04:30.153 --> 04:33.490
since Jade Fox murdered him.
I have yet to avenge his death.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.827
And yet I'm thinking of quitting.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.329
I must pray for his forgiveness.

04:39.996 --> 04:44.292
Join me once you have finished.

04:44.626 --> 04:46.962
I can wait for you in Peking.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.381
Perhaps.

04:57.139 --> 04:59.641
- Okay. Pass.
- Thanks.

04:59.724 --> 05:01.518
Let's go into the city.

05:01.601 --> 05:02.602
Let's go!

I'm much obliged.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.827
Just doing my job.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.831
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.752
You're a credit to his memory.

05:28.044 --> 05:31.256
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

personal sword...

06:10.503 --> 06:12.505
...a great hero's weapon.

06:12.589 --> 06:16.134
He is the only one in the world...

06:16.468 --> 06:19.054
...worthy of carrying it.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.265
It's too fine a gift.
I cannot accept it.

06:22.682 --> 06:26.353
Sir Te, it has brought him
as much trouble as glory.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.314
Help him to leave
these troubles behind.

06:29.439 --> 06:31.691
Otherwise, he'll never
be able to start anew.

06:33.109 --> 06:36.154
All right.
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

06:39.241 --> 06:41.243
Governor Yu has arrived.

06:41.326 --> 06:42.911
I must change.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.081
You've always been so good
to Li Mu Bai and me.

06:46.164 --> 06:48.500
Please accept our thanks.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.921
Please do not be such a stranger.
You'll stay the night as my guest.

06:55.006 --> 06:57.425
Now, Shu Lien,

06:57.509 --> 07:01.429
tell me something,
and forgive me for prying.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.975
Your father was a great friend to me...

07:05.058 --> 07:08.186
...and I think of you
as my own daughter.

07:08.478 --> 07:10.689
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

07:11.022 --> 07:15.986
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword
and his warrior days,

07:16.778 --> 07:19.572
maybe he's trying
to tell you something?

07:20.448 --> 07:23.034
- I don't know.
- Don't be coy.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.288
I've always known about
your feelings for each other.

07:26.371 --> 07:28.790
All these years, it's a shame...

07:28.873 --> 07:32.544
...neither of you is brave enough
to admit the truth to the other.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.881
You're both wasting precious time.

07:37.966 --> 07:40.093
I beg your pardon.

07:40.176 --> 07:42.637
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.514
(TE CHUCKLING)

07:44.639 --> 07:50.437
When it comes to emotions,
even great heroes can be idiots.

07:51.646 --> 07:55.817
Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
the next time you see him.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.779
I'll give him an earful!

08:08.621 --> 08:10.915
Sir Te said to leave the sword in here.

08:16.546 --> 08:17.589
Who are you?

08:22.927 --> 08:26.348
I'm your guest today.
I am Governor Yu's daughter.

08:28.266 --> 08:31.186
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to...?

08:31.561 --> 08:35.482
I was just looking
for a quiet corner.

08:36.274 --> 08:40.445
I'm Sir Te's head servant.
And this is another of our guests.

08:53.124 --> 08:56.086
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!

08:56.336 --> 08:59.464
SHU LIEN: The handle is heavy.
And the blade is no ordinary metal.

08:59.964 --> 09:03.218
Still, the sword
is the lightest of weapons.

09:03.593 --> 09:06.262
You're just not used to handling it.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.807
But I have had much practice.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.267
As a child in the West,
a platoon lived with us.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.603
They'd let me play
with their weapons.

09:14.813 --> 09:17.148
The scabbard is so beautiful.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.527
Beautiful but dangerous.

09:20.610 --> 09:24.364
Once you see it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.

09:25.323 --> 09:27.826
It's 400 years old.

09:28.451 --> 09:30.120
Exquisite!

09:31.079 --> 09:33.581
You said it belongs to...?

09:34.165 --> 09:38.128
My friend Li Mu Bai.
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

09:38.711 --> 09:42.090
Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior?

09:42.799 --> 09:44.592
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

09:46.469 --> 09:48.263
You're too young to understand.

09:50.098 --> 09:54.352
- You're a sword fighter too?
- Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete.

09:54.477 --> 09:58.523
Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.776
Really.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.948
It must be exciting to be a fighter,
to be totally free!

10:07.365 --> 10:09.367
Fighters have rules, too.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.996
Friendship, trust, integrity.

10:13.288 --> 10:16.040
Without rules,
we wouldn't survive for long.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.169
I've read all about people like you.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.172
Roaming wild,
beating up anyone who gets in your way!

10:22.255 --> 10:25.216
(CHUCKLES) Writers wouldn't sell
many books if they told how it really is.

10:25.383 --> 10:28.136
But you're just like
the characters in the stories.

10:28.261 --> 10:32.098
SHU LIEN: Sure, no place to bathe for days,
sleeping on flea-infested beds.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.976
They tell you all about that in those books?

10:35.059 --> 10:36.978
You know what I mean.

10:37.395 --> 10:41.399
I'm getting married soon,
but I haven't lived the life I want.

10:42.692 --> 10:45.487
So I heard. Congratulations.

10:49.449 --> 10:53.203
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

10:54.787 --> 10:58.208
- You are not married, are you?
- What do you think?

10:58.750 --> 11:01.169
No. You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

11:02.504 --> 11:04.881
You're probably right.

11:50.552 --> 11:55.223
2 feet 9 inches long, 1.1 inch wide.

11:55.390 --> 11:58.685
The handle is 8 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide,

11:59.018 --> 12:02.313
7/10ths of an inch thick.
1.5 inches from ear to ear of the handle.

12:02.730 --> 12:04.899
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

12:05.733 --> 12:10.154
You can tell the design dates back
to before the Chin era.

12:10.321 --> 12:13.324
Engraved with a technique lost
by the time of the Han Dynasty.

12:13.408 --> 12:16.494
Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

12:18.246 --> 12:20.456
A sword by itself rules nothing.

12:20.665 --> 12:23.167
It comes alive
only through skillful manipulation.

12:24.294 --> 12:27.255
I see your point.
Please continue.

12:27.422 --> 12:30.216
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.429
With royalty and officials everywhere...

12:35.013 --> 12:39.225
...the Royal Guard keeps security tight.

12:39.642 --> 12:41.686
But Peking is not like the West.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.315
Here, you'll find all sorts of characters.

12:46.357 --> 12:49.402
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

12:49.485 --> 12:51.863
Don't depend only on the court.

12:51.946 --> 12:54.907
Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld...

12:55.700 --> 12:57.785
...can ensure your position.

13:02.373 --> 13:05.877
Be strong yet supple.
This is the way to rule.

She's one of those people.

14:03.017 --> 14:06.854
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

It'll be just the same.

Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

There's a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.

- I'll tell her.

Yes, Miss.

I have a guest.

24:21.218 --> 24:22.803
This way, please.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.686
I've missed you.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.813
- How so?
- I'm bored.

24:40.237 --> 24:42.364
You're doing calligraphy?

24:43.407 --> 24:46.577
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

25:13.103 --> 25:15.939
I never realized my name
looks like "sword."

25:16.273 --> 25:20.069
You write gracefully.
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

25:20.903 --> 25:23.155
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

25:24.948 --> 25:26.241
Please.

25:30.621 --> 25:33.832
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

25:34.124 --> 25:36.335
You must be overwhelmed
by the preparations.

25:36.418 --> 25:39.922
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it, the better.

25:40.297 --> 25:45.135
My parents are arranging everything.

25:45.511 --> 25:49.473
The Gous are a very powerful family.

25:49.932 --> 25:53.685
My marrying one will be good
for my father's career.

25:54.103 --> 25:57.439
You are fortunate to marry
into such a noble family.

25:58.315 --> 26:02.486
Am I? I wish I were like the heroes
in the books I read.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.321
Like you and Li Mu Bai.

26:05.989 --> 26:07.699
I guess I'm happy to be marrying.

26:07.866 --> 26:10.244
But to be free to live my own life...

26:10.327 --> 26:12.079
...to choose whom I love...

26:12.162 --> 26:14.498
...and to experience love
in my own way...

26:15.332 --> 26:17.292
...that is true happiness.

26:18.836 --> 26:22.673
- Let me tell you a story.
- About you and Li Mu Bai?

26:22.965 --> 26:26.802
Yes. Did you know I was once engaged
to be married?

26:28.178 --> 26:31.014
- No, really?
- His name was Meng Si Zhao.

26:31.515 --> 26:34.184
He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.

26:34.685 --> 26:36.895
One day, while in battle...

26:36.979 --> 26:40.190
...he was killed by the sword
of Li Mu Bai's enemy.

26:41.150 --> 26:44.695
After, Li Mu Bai and I
went through a lot together.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.864
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

26:46.947 --> 26:51.118
But how could we dishonor
Meng's memory?

26:51.326 --> 26:54.163
So the freedom you talk about,
I, too, desire it.

26:54.496 --> 26:56.373
But I have never tasted it.

26:56.707 --> 26:59.209
Too bad for Meng...

26:59.418 --> 27:02.754
...but it's not your fault,
or Li Mu Bai's.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.759
I am not an aristocrat as you are...

27:08.177 --> 27:12.723

- Why were you spying on the Yus?
- I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

29:26.690 --> 29:30.944
I'm a police inspector
from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

29:31.028 --> 29:35.032
Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

29:35.198 --> 29:38.785
She must have come with them
when they transferred here.

29:39.202 --> 29:43.915
But with Yu's reputation,
I can't just go in and accuse her.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.043
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- Yes.

29:46.126 --> 29:48.337
Then leave her to me.

29:48.629 --> 29:51.214
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.

29:51.798 --> 29:55.844
My wife was quite a martial arts expert.
Jade Fox killed her.

29:55.927 --> 30:00.599

30:36.885 --> 30:40.430
Sir Te believes it's a ploy
to cast suspicion on Governor Yu.

30:40.555 --> 30:44.059
But something is going on
at the Yu household.

30:44.142 --> 30:45.686
What have you discovered?

30:58.407 --> 31:00.784
Jade Fox? Impossible!

31:01.118 --> 31:04.121
You'd always suspected
she'd fled to the west.

31:04.204 --> 31:06.456
I didn't think she'd dare
come back to Peking!

31:06.581 --> 31:10.252

than under the nose of Governor Yu?

31:12.295 --> 31:15.590

my master's death after all.

31:17.634 --> 31:19.136

- Did you see who posted it?
- No.

31:39.614 --> 31:41.742

31:42.159 --> 31:45.078
On the night of the theft,
there was a brawl near Yu's.

31:45.912 --> 31:47.914
Were you involved?

31:48.165 --> 31:50.167
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.919
I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.

31:53.295 --> 31:57.257
- Have you questioned him yet?
- No, not yet--

31:57.340 --> 31:59.760
But your men are watching over
Yu's compound?

32:01.011 --> 32:03.472
No, I'd already sent them home.

that I'll get it back soon...

41:26.242 --> 41:27.785
I doubt that.

41:28.369 --> 41:32.415
This thief is very unusual.

41:32.582 --> 41:35.585
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

41:47.555 --> 41:51.934
- Greetings, Sir Te.
- Hello, Madam Yu.

41:52.226 --> 41:55.605
This is Li Mu Bai,
the renowned swordsman.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.941
Delighted to meet you.

41:59.359 --> 42:01.903
Miss Yu is soon to be married.

42:04.238 --> 42:05.948
Congratulations.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.839

42:22.090 --> 42:26.469

- Come in. It's cold.

Jade Fox if we're together.

44:02.899 --> 44:06.486

when nothing in this world is real?

44:06.569 --> 44:08.654

45:15.513 --> 45:16.722

45:16.806 --> 45:20.726
You need practice. I can teach you
to fight with the Green Destiny.

45:21.102 --> 45:23.854
But first you must learn
to hold it in stillness.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.401
GIRL: Why do you want to teach me?

45:29.986 --> 45:34.824
I've always wanted a disciple
worthy of Wudan secrets.

45:36.993 --> 45:39.203
GIRL: And if I use them to kill you?

45:39.912 --> 45:42.540
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

45:43.291 --> 45:47.169
Deep down, you're good.
Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.

45:49.046 --> 45:52.633
GIRL: Wudan is a whorehouse!
Keep your lessons!

46:11.694 --> 46:14.572
You're home late. Or should I say early?

46:17.491 --> 46:19.910
Why are you still here?
You killed a policeman.

46:20.161 --> 46:21.704
You should leave!

46:22.330 --> 46:25.041
You will ruin my whole family.

46:25.333 --> 46:29.211
They wouldn't have found me
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

46:29.587 --> 46:33.174
Like a little girl,
you thought stealing would be fun?

46:33.507 --> 46:36.677
You, too, are responsible
for that death. Come with me.

46:37.762 --> 46:41.891
You don't want to waste your life
as the wife of some bureaucrat.

46:43.059 --> 46:44.352
Denied your talent.

46:44.935 --> 46:48.731
- As master and disciple, we will rule.
- I'll never live as a thief!

46:48.814 --> 46:50.816
You're already a thief.

46:50.900 --> 46:52.276
That was just for fun.

46:52.485 --> 46:54.195
How can I leave?
Where would I go?

46:55.321 --> 46:58.908
Wherever we want.
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

46:58.991 --> 47:01.160
- Even your father.
- Shut up!

47:01.243 --> 47:05.247
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle.
Kill or be killed.

47:05.331 --> 47:07.917
Exciting, isn't it?

47:12.129 --> 47:16.676
- I owe you nothing.
- Yes, you do!

47:18.427 --> 47:21.764
You are still my disciple.

47:29.271 --> 47:33.567
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

47:34.068 --> 47:36.320
You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

47:38.322 --> 47:40.449
I studied the diagrams.

47:41.075 --> 47:43.119
But you hid the details!

47:43.244 --> 47:47.289
You wouldn't have understood,
even if I had tried to explain.

47:47.456 --> 47:51.127
You know
you've gone as far as you can go.

47:52.128 --> 47:54.964
I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.

47:57.466 --> 48:00.469
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai,

48:01.470 --> 48:04.932
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

48:07.810 --> 48:08.978
Master...

48:10.688 --> 48:14.024
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

48:14.483 --> 48:17.695
You enchanted me
with the world of Giang Hu.

48:17.778 --> 48:21.031
But once I realized I could surpass you,

48:21.532 --> 48:23.409
I became so frightened!

48:24.994 --> 48:28.664
Everything fell apart.
I had no one to guide me...

48:30.499 --> 48:32.376
...no one to learn from.

48:34.503 --> 48:38.340
Believe me.
I've a lesson or two left to teach you!

48:50.603 --> 48:52.980
(ROOSTER CROWING)

49:28.307 --> 49:31.268
(GRUNTING)

49:51.080 --> 49:54.124

49:55.584 --> 49:59.588
I admit, getting it back makes me
realize how much I'd missed it.

50:01.090 --> 50:05.386
But it's not your sword anymore.
You gave it to Sir Te.

50:07.263 --> 50:11.767
True. But I must borrow it
for one last mission.

50:12.643 --> 50:15.062
Jade Fox must die at its edge.

50:18.607 --> 50:23.153
Shu Lien. Did you know what you
were hiding when you covered for that girl?

50:23.946 --> 50:27.408
My job was to get the sword back
without embarrassing anyone.

50:27.992 --> 50:32.788
I wasn't about to ruin her life,
or her father's.

50:33.247 --> 50:36.166
You did your job well.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.961
But this girl...

50:39.712 --> 50:41.130
I saw her last night.

50:43.757 --> 50:45.718
I knew she would intrigue you.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.095
LI: She needs direction

50:48.304 --> 50:50.931
and training.

50:51.640 --> 50:54.810
She's an aristocrat's daughter,
she's not one of us.

50:54.935 --> 51:00.441
In any case, it will all be over soon.
You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.

51:02.651 --> 51:06.655
That's not for her. She should come
to Wudan and become a disciple.

51:08.115 --> 51:09.783
But Wudan doesn't accept women.

51:10.492 --> 51:13.078
For her, they might make an exception.

51:13.162 --> 51:17.124
If not, I'm afraid she'll become
a poisoned dragon.

51:17.708 --> 51:20.252
It's not our concern.

51:20.586 --> 51:24.715
Even if Wudan accepts her,
her husband might object.

51:27.426 --> 51:28.719
(SIGHS)

51:28.802 --> 51:33.265

I could escape the Giang Hu world.

But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

51:38.687 --> 51:42.191

I could do to help you.
