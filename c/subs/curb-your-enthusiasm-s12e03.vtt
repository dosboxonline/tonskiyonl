WEBVTT

00:13.082 --> 00:15.628
- That's a long flight, man.
- Long flight. Yeah.

00:15.628 --> 00:16.796
Brutal.

00:16.796 --> 00:19.924
Hey, Larry, I see you.
Keep fighting for us.

00:21.174 --> 00:23.593
Okay. Huh? How about that?

00:23.593 --> 00:26.221
My people showing you
fucking love, Larry.

00:26.221 --> 00:27.515
Larry David.

00:28.015 --> 00:32.560
Oh my God, it's Larry David.
Sorry, I'm Sienna Miller.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.107
I can't believe I'm seeing you. I've
just been watching you on the news.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.858
- How crazy is this, right?
- It's crazy.

00:38.858 --> 00:42.195
Well, thank you, on behalf
of everybody who has a heart.

00:42.195 --> 00:43.823
Hey, Larry, good job!

00:44.280 --> 00:47.075
Anyway, I cannot believe
that I've bumped into you.

00:47.075 --> 00:49.285
It's bashert.

00:50.121 --> 00:52.790
- Where'd you get that from?
- Pretty good, huh?

00:52.790 --> 00:54.124
Yeah, pretty good.

00:54.124 --> 00:56.669
Bye, Larry.
Keep in touch.

01:03.758 --> 01:05.468
Keep in touch? You saw that?

01:05.468 --> 01:07.721
Sienna Miller, she was flirting
with me, was she not?

01:07.721 --> 01:08.931
Saw that shit.

01:08.931 --> 01:10.683
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,

01:10.683 --> 01:12.892
but because of Irma,
there's nothing I can do.

01:13.476 --> 01:15.479
It's such a waste, really.

01:15.479 --> 01:17.189
Sienna Miller, my God.

01:18.481 --> 01:20.234
- How's that bagel?
- Fucking great, man.

01:20.234 --> 01:22.819
You know what?
I'm not gonna eat this.

01:24.029 --> 01:26.031
Think I'll give it to that guy.
What do you think?

01:26.031 --> 01:28.117
If it's in your heart, you do it.

01:28.117 --> 01:29.868
Hey, you want a bagel?

01:31.328 --> 01:32.412
Yeah.

01:35.124 --> 01:37.960
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop, stop!

01:38.711 --> 01:40.003
Thanks, man.

01:49.929 --> 01:52.183
- Fluke!
- Oh my God.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.560
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

01:54.560 --> 01:58.480
- I got fluke in three.
- Fluke? Who does that?

01:58.480 --> 02:01.399
It's so disrespectful. It's like
sneezing in someone's face.

02:01.399 --> 02:04.360
- You just ruined our day.
- I'm going to an AA meeting.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.654
- This is crazy.
- You would never have gotten it.

02:06.654 --> 02:08.407
- I would've got it.
- I had to help you with vulva.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.992
I know vulva.
That's a great car.

02:10.992 --> 02:13.245
- No, it's not a car.
- It's one of the safest cars.

02:13.245 --> 02:15.164
You never would've gotten fluke.

02:15.164 --> 02:17.875
- Hey, don't do that again.
- You never would've gotten it.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.210
- I would've got it.
- Get over it.

02:19.794 --> 02:23.339
- Such a shitty thing to do.
- She's something else, man.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.804
What the hell? Come on!

02:29.804 --> 02:33.306
I just saw your balls! They're
hanging out with those shorts!

02:33.306 --> 02:35.683
What is that? Just swivel back.

02:35.683 --> 02:37.978
Oh my God.
What's with those shorts?

02:37.978 --> 02:40.648
What is it about my balls
that bother you like this?

02:40.648 --> 02:43.609
Balls are disgusting. It's like the
elephant man under your penis.

02:43.609 --> 02:45.694
I think the brain and the balls
are related.

02:45.694 --> 02:48.572
If you take a magnifying glass
and you put it on your balls,

02:48.572 --> 02:51.075
it's the same pattern as the brain.

02:51.075 --> 02:53.952
That's why people say
you're thinking with your dick.

02:54.577 --> 02:57.373
Every now and then
you say something so stupid,

02:57.373 --> 02:58.707
but it actually makes sense.

02:58.707 --> 03:01.043
- 'Course it makes sense.
- I'm getting out of here.

03:01.043 --> 03:03.253
- Where you going at?
- You know Duane Tubman next door?

03:03.253 --> 03:05.840
- Hell yeah, Tubman.
- His father just died.

03:07.382 --> 03:09.260
Hey, you give him
my deepest condolences.

03:09.260 --> 03:12.972
I feel like I should go over
and pay my respects or something.

03:12.972 --> 03:15.975
It always helps to be on good terms
with your neighbor.

03:15.975 --> 03:19.018
Okay. You know what?
I just got another glimpse.

03:19.018 --> 03:21.104
Honestly, that one was on purpose!

03:35.911 --> 03:39.957
Sorry.

03:40.457 --> 03:43.502
So sorry. Hey.

03:43.502 --> 03:45.044
Larry, thank you so much for coming.

03:45.044 --> 03:47.172
Of course. Hey,
this is what neighbors do, right?

03:47.172 --> 03:49.132
We have each other's backs.
Come on.

03:49.132 --> 03:52.510
By the way, I was really touched
by what you did in Atlanta.

03:52.510 --> 03:55.388
Coming from a Tubman,
I take that as a great compliment.

03:55.723 --> 03:56.766
Okay.

03:56.766 --> 03:59.769
Anyway, very sorry to hear
about your father.

03:59.769 --> 04:02.730
Thank you. Well, father-in-law,
but thank you.

04:03.980 --> 04:06.816
Really?
I thought it was your father.

04:06.816 --> 04:08.694
No, it's Lorraine's.

04:08.694 --> 04:10.111
- Father-in-law?
- Yeah.

04:10.111 --> 04:14.866
That's a little better.

04:15.242 --> 04:17.535
Well, it's my father-in-law.
lt's a loss.

04:17.535 --> 04:21.414
Duane, of course it's a loss,
but you know, it's not your dad.

04:21.414 --> 04:23.958
- Larry, it's a human being.
- Yeah, of course. I know that.

04:23.958 --> 04:26.336
I'm just trying to delineate the
differences between a father

04:26.336 --> 04:27.462
and a father-in-law.

04:27.462 --> 04:31.424
- It's a very sad thing.
- Terrible loss for your wife, but...

04:33.344 --> 04:34.845
- Your dad's still alive?
- Yeah.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.305
- There you go.
- Yeah, that's a gift.

04:37.305 --> 04:40.726
And you know, it's like if you have
a dog and your dog dies...

04:40.726 --> 04:43.854
- I'm sorry, did you say a dog?
- Yeah, a dog. Say your dog dies.

04:43.854 --> 04:45.897
That's one thing. That's terrible.

04:45.897 --> 04:49.068
But if your friend's dog dies,
it's not quite the same.

04:49.902 --> 04:52.071
But anyway, is your wife around?
Lorraine?

04:52.071 --> 04:53.905
Is she here? Can I talk to her?

04:53.905 --> 04:55.281
Maybe we just let her rest.

04:55.281 --> 04:57.868
Will you tell her how sorry
I am about her dad?

04:57.868 --> 05:00.245
Are you?
Because it doesn't really sound like it.

05:00.245 --> 05:01.412
Between you and me,

05:01.412 --> 05:05.084
my condolences aren't quite as deep
as the average person's.

05:05.084 --> 05:06.669
I'm picking that up.

05:06.669 --> 05:09.420
It's like people telling each other
they love them. That kind of thing.

05:09.420 --> 05:12.508
Sorry's in that kind of category.
They're the same.

05:12.508 --> 05:15.343
They're interchangeable, really.
Nobody means it. I love you.

05:15.343 --> 05:17.887
Nobody means it?
Of course people mean it.

05:17.887 --> 05:21.808
Nobody means it. But, anyway,
are you sure Lorraine's not around?

05:21.808 --> 05:23.018
I'm positive.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.477
Got enough food and everything?

05:24.477 --> 05:26.354
Can I get you some bagels
and lox?

05:26.354 --> 05:28.398
- I think we're good.
- Do you like a bagel?

05:28.398 --> 05:30.693
There are a lot of people here,
so I'm gonna...

05:30.693 --> 05:34.363
I'm picking up on that cue. Of course.

05:34.363 --> 05:37.449
Actually, Larry, there's one thing.

05:37.449 --> 05:39.118
I wanted to talk to you
about the lemon tree.

05:39.118 --> 05:41.035
- The lemon tree?
- Yeah. Along the fence.

05:41.035 --> 05:43.455
It's back there. It's given us
so many lemons over the years.

05:43.455 --> 05:45.123
The one that hangs over my yard.

05:45.123 --> 05:47.667
The roots,
they're damaging my pipes,

05:47.667 --> 05:49.878
so we got to do something
about this tree.

05:49.878 --> 05:52.131
Don't worry about the research.
I'll look into it.

05:52.131 --> 05:53.465
I'll get an estimate, we'll sit down,

05:53.465 --> 05:55.468
and we'll split the cost
of the tree maintenance,

05:55.468 --> 05:57.219
and we can keep
enjoying these lemons.

05:57.219 --> 05:59.345
Split the cost of the tree?

05:59.721 --> 06:04.059
Duane. I mean, you know, come on.
It's your tree. It's on your side.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.935
- It's our tree.
- It's not our tree.

06:05.935 --> 06:09.314
Let me get this right. So it's our tree
when you want lemons,

06:09.314 --> 06:12.067
and it's my tree when we have
to take care of it and maintain it.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.903
I want some lemons?
I don't want lemons.

06:13.903 --> 06:15.111
You think I need lemons in my life?

06:15.111 --> 06:17.239
I can go the rest of my life
without touching a lemon.

06:17.239 --> 06:19.658
- No lemons for life.
- I put it on a piece of fish.

06:19.658 --> 06:21.242
What're you gonna substitute
for lemons?

06:21.242 --> 06:24.080
- A grapefruit.
- You're gonna put grapefruit on fish?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.874
- I put grapefruits on fish.
- When?

06:26.874 --> 06:29.584
I haven't actually put it on,
but I've thought about it.

06:29.584 --> 06:30.795
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:30.795 --> 06:33.839
My point is lemons
are a fungible citrus.

06:33.839 --> 06:36.424
Just look around the room.
We've suffered a loss.

06:36.424 --> 06:38.051
You lost your father-in-law.

06:38.051 --> 06:40.763
I'd appreciate you stepping up
and being a neighbor

06:40.763 --> 06:42.515
and paying for half of this tree maintenance.

06:42.515 --> 06:44.182
Thank you for coming out.

06:50.064 --> 06:52.857
Had I known that it was
his father-in-law,

06:52.857 --> 06:54.984
I never would've gone to the house
in the first place.

06:54.984 --> 06:56.278
And this lemon thing.

06:56.278 --> 06:58.823
By the way, you know,
he's a descendant of Harriet Tubman.

06:58.823 --> 07:01.951
Well, you'd think his ancestors would
be ashamed of him.

07:01.951 --> 07:04.161
No, the lemons drop.
What am I supposed to do?

07:04.161 --> 07:06.913
- Throw 'em back over the fence?
- This person's a Tubman in name only.

07:06.913 --> 07:08.540
Maybe he's not even a Tubman.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.127
'Cause I can't imagine
a Tubman behaving like this.

07:11.127 --> 07:14.212
You know the cruel irony of this,
right? You're being railroaded.

07:15.172 --> 07:17.465
- It's nuts.
- Hello!

07:18.175 --> 07:20.593
- Sorry we're late.
- Hi.

07:20.593 --> 07:22.512
Susie, we have something for you.

07:22.512 --> 07:24.432
Since you were away
on your birthday...

07:24.432 --> 07:26.808
- You want me to open it now?
- Are you ready?

07:27.435 --> 07:30.854
Wait a second.
There's other presents here.

07:30.854 --> 07:34.066
I know, but this is really important.
This'll make sense in one minute.

07:34.066 --> 07:37.694
- I'm scared. What is it?
- Happy birthday!

07:37.694 --> 07:38.862
Oh my God!

07:40.114 --> 07:43.325
Isn't he the cutest thing
you've ever seen, Susie?

07:43.325 --> 07:46.454
- He's beautiful.
- He loves you!

07:46.454 --> 07:48.037
Beautiful.

07:48.037 --> 07:51.749
This is the best birthday present
I've ever got. I love you two.

07:51.749 --> 07:53.627
You're the greatest friends.

07:56.588 --> 08:00.718
- You know, we have a present, too.
- Thank you so much.

08:00.718 --> 08:02.302
- What is it?
- Well, look.

08:03.387 --> 08:05.263
- A Theragun.
- What's that?

08:05.263 --> 08:08.267
- Larry got it for you.
- Thank you, Larr.

08:09.434 --> 08:12.812
- You ever use one of these?
- No, I haven't.

08:13.564 --> 08:16.150
- They're good for your health.
- Good. I look forward to it.

08:16.150 --> 08:19.778
- That's a hell of a gift, by the way.
- He's probably thirsty.

08:19.778 --> 08:22.572
- He's been in that box.
- I'd like a Theragun.

08:26.994 --> 08:28.746
So food good? Everybody happy?

08:28.746 --> 08:30.789
The food is amazing, as always.

08:30.789 --> 08:33.250
- Freddy, you're not vegan now, right?
- No, no, I like the chicken.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.502
- You're looking fantastic.
- That's so nice of you.

08:35.502 --> 08:37.922
It's just been a little SoulCycle,
some walking,

08:37.922 --> 08:40.632
and I've been having a lot of sex
with my neighbor's wife.

08:42.301 --> 08:45.429
Yes. My neighbors, the Harringtons,
Lydia and Ron.

08:45.429 --> 08:46.680
She wants to have a baby.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.184
Turns out Ron is not capable.
She can't get pregnant.

08:50.184 --> 08:51.851
Blanks. Shooting blanks.

08:51.851 --> 08:55.730
So they say, "Freddy, we would love it
if you could get Lydia pregnant."

08:55.730 --> 08:58.776
- Get out of here.
- Hold on.

09:00.694 --> 09:03.823
They think the baby's going to be
healthier if there's really a connection

09:03.823 --> 09:05.490
that happens during intercourse.

09:05.490 --> 09:07.368
- I can't even believe it.
- This gets weirder.

09:07.368 --> 09:10.537
So I say, "Yes." They say,
"Terrific. How's tonight work?

09:10.537 --> 09:13.624
"She's ovulating tonight."
And what they say to me is:

09:13.624 --> 09:16.377
"Here's how it's gonna work."
They want boundaries.

09:16.377 --> 09:18.670
Keep it kind of clinical.
But guess what happens?

09:18.670 --> 09:19.880
What happens?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.881
When the shit gets lit up,
there's no goddamn rules.

09:23.049 --> 09:24.801
She comes in the door, and it's on.

09:25.636 --> 09:27.762
And I mean, we do it at my house
on the Funk-O-Matic.

09:28.722 --> 09:31.225
We're biting butts.
We're biting the ears.

09:31.225 --> 09:32.518
This is fucking crazy.

09:32.518 --> 09:34.686
It's some of the best sex
I've ever had in my life.

09:34.686 --> 09:37.397
- And she loves her husband?
- She's 100% in love with her husband.

09:37.397 --> 09:39.607
- Do you give her a climax?
- Well, I don't know.

09:39.607 --> 09:42.027
- How would you not know?
- I don't ask.

09:42.027 --> 09:45.613
Do you smell musk? The sex musk you
release is great for conception.

09:45.613 --> 09:48.451
I release a lot of sex musk.
Don't I, Larry?

09:49.869 --> 09:53.955
Puppy!
Where's my little boy?

09:53.955 --> 09:56.625
I'm gonna make a toast here.
I don't mind I have a mocktail.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.335
- Because I'm sober.
- And cheers to that.

10:00.129 --> 10:02.631
- You want a sip?
- Very funny.

10:05.675 --> 10:07.886
Oh my goodness.

10:07.886 --> 10:09.721
Okay, so I decided what
we're gonna name him.

10:10.930 --> 10:13.766
- Frankie, after Sinatra.
- That's a boy?

10:13.766 --> 10:14.976
It's a little boy.

10:14.976 --> 10:18.188
I got to say, for a male dog,
it looks a tad effeminate.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.982
Oh my God. Come on.

10:19.982 --> 10:22.150
I think you better get that dog
a pronoun.

10:23.693 --> 10:26.238
Okay, Troy, three steps
we're going to work on.

10:26.238 --> 10:31.117
First, rotation on the backswing.
Back to the target. Beautiful.

10:31.117 --> 10:32.745
Okay, that's the first piece.

10:32.745 --> 10:34.788
Second piece, same rotation,
that backswing.

10:34.788 --> 10:37.999
Up to the top and stop. Nice.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.752
Okay, now here's the master move, okay?

10:39.752 --> 10:43.923
Next piece, from there,
we go vertical drop. Okay?

10:44.465 --> 10:48.094
Horizontal tug. Nice. Can you feel it
with the obliques there?

10:48.094 --> 10:50.221
One more time. Up to the top.

10:50.221 --> 10:52.807
Feel the rotation. Vertical drop.

10:56.518 --> 10:58.062
Horizontal tug.

11:00.356 --> 11:02.316
Hey. Can I help you?

11:03.484 --> 11:04.652
Nah, I'm good.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.362
I got a private lesson with Troy here.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.572
Yeah, yeah. Go.

11:08.572 --> 11:10.908
If you want to book a lesson,
just call the golf shop.

11:10.908 --> 11:13.035
They'll be happy to set something up
for you.

11:13.035 --> 11:14.745
Nah, I'm good. I'm just sitting here.

11:14.745 --> 11:18.082
I saw the vertical drop,
horizontal tug.

11:18.082 --> 11:20.334
There's a bench here.
I'm allowed to sit on a bench.

11:20.334 --> 11:22.585
- It's not that kind of bench.
- What kind of bench is it?

11:22.585 --> 11:25.131
It's not a lingering bench, okay?
lt's an aesthetic bench.

11:25.131 --> 11:28.008
An aesthetic bench?
No. Benches are for sitting.

11:28.008 --> 11:30.094
We're gonna get back to the lesson,
if you don't mind.

11:30.094 --> 11:32.430
Let's try it again. The rotation.

11:32.430 --> 11:35.558
Okay, stay in your spine angle.
Now vertical drop, horizontal tuck.

11:35.558 --> 11:39.186
Yeah, there it is. Okay, let's try one.
Altogether, one piece.

11:52.866 --> 11:56.119
I did Wordle again today.
I'm a Wordle wizard, man.

11:56.119 --> 11:58.664
I did it in three tries.
That's three days in a row, man.

11:58.664 --> 12:00.458
Wow, you're really on a good streak.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.418
I'm on a huge streak. That's right.

12:02.418 --> 12:04.920
All right, let's see if I can continue
my streak.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.964
You've been unbelievable. What is this
all about? How are you doing this?

12:07.964 --> 12:11.968
I sat on a bench this morning
and overheard a lesson.

12:11.968 --> 12:14.013
I've had thousands of hours
of lessons.

12:14.013 --> 12:16.681
Two minutes on that bench.
This guy changed my life.

12:16.681 --> 12:18.476
- What kind of tips?
- Vertical drop.

12:19.226 --> 12:23.272
Horizontal tug!
Vertical drop, horizontal tug!

12:23.272 --> 12:25.858
Now, I've dropped before,
but I've never tugged!

12:25.858 --> 12:27.568
- And now I'm tugging!
- Maybe I should tug.

12:27.568 --> 12:30.321
- Can you teach me how to tug?
- I'll teach you how to tug!

12:30.321 --> 12:32.156
- This is fantastic.
- Can I tell you something?

12:32.739 --> 12:34.617
I think this is the happiest
I've ever been in my life!

12:34.617 --> 12:36.367
I don't even know
who I'm looking at right now.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.077
How is something good
happening to me?

12:38.077 --> 12:40.206
No one on the planet would
believe that you're happy.

12:40.206 --> 12:41.415
How is this possible?

12:41.415 --> 12:43.501
I have better news for you.
I'm leaving you in my will.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.877
- I'm tweaking it, and you're in it.
- Don't do that.

12:45.877 --> 12:47.212
It's done. You're in.

12:47.212 --> 12:50.257
I have money. I don't need it.
Give it to someone who needs it.

12:50.257 --> 12:52.593
When I die, I want you to know
how much I cared about you.

12:52.593 --> 12:54.385
I'm not gonna keep it.
I'm gonna give it to charity.

12:54.385 --> 12:55.929
You're my best friend.
You're getting it.

12:55.929 --> 12:58.432
I'm making a Shermanesque statement
about the will right now.

12:58.432 --> 13:00.225
I'm sick of your historical references.

13:00.225 --> 13:03.562
If nominated, I will not run.
If bequeathed, I will not accept.

13:03.562 --> 13:05.397
- Well, I'm bequeathing.
- Well, I'm not accepting.

13:05.397 --> 13:07.358
- Well, you'll have to accept.
- Don't give it to me!

13:07.358 --> 13:09.777
- Don't hurt my feelings.
- I'm not gonna keep a penny of it.

13:09.777 --> 13:11.779
- You're hurting me.
- Thank you, but I don't want it.

13:11.779 --> 13:15.157
- I'm giving it to you anyway, pal.
- Oh my God. Fuck you!

13:19.829 --> 13:21.122
What are you doing?

13:21.704 --> 13:23.207
What do you mean? I'm waiting.

13:23.207 --> 13:24.457
For what?

13:24.457 --> 13:26.085
Troy and Jimmy
are on the fairway.

13:26.085 --> 13:28.378
- You're never gonna hit them.
- You don't think I could hit them?

13:28.378 --> 13:32.132
No! You've never hit the ball
that far in your life. Come on.

13:32.549 --> 13:33.759
Really?

13:33.759 --> 13:35.886
You're never gonna hit it that far.
What, are you nuts?

13:35.886 --> 13:37.179
All right, shut up.

13:37.637 --> 13:38.973
No, you shut up.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.235
- Holy shit!
- You hit him.

13:52.235 --> 13:54.154
- I hit him!
- Troy, you okay?

13:54.946 --> 13:56.656
- Oh my God!
- How did you do that?

13:56.656 --> 13:58.616
Hey! What the fuck?

13:58.616 --> 14:01.537
- I told you I shouldn't fucking...
- Larry!

14:04.832 --> 14:08.085
Troy, are you okay? Slowly.
Take it easy.

14:08.085 --> 14:11.172
Oh my God. Oh God. I'm so sorry.

14:11.172 --> 14:12.297
What in the hell?

14:12.297 --> 14:14.674
I don't know what happened.
I'm so sorry.

14:14.674 --> 14:16.092
Why didn't you yell, "fore"?

14:16.092 --> 14:18.471
I couldn't yell, "fore".
I mean, he can't hear.

14:18.471 --> 14:21.891
And what would be the point?
I waved. I did a lot of waving.

14:21.891 --> 14:23.851
When you talk,
the interpreter can hear you.

14:23.851 --> 14:26.061
I know, but he was too far.
He was in the car.

14:26.061 --> 14:27.855
We could have ran to the trees!

14:27.855 --> 14:30.858
There was no time!
The ball was coming down!

14:30.858 --> 14:33.110
Superman couldn't get there
in time to stop that.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.945
Why didn't you wait?

14:34.945 --> 14:38.114
Because the guys I was playing
with, they said, "go, go, go".

14:38.114 --> 14:40.284
They embarrassed me. They said,
"Oh, you can never hit him."

14:40.284 --> 14:42.453
Did you do the vertical drop,
horizontal tug?

14:42.453 --> 14:45.081
Yeah, I did it. I did the vertical drop
and the horizontal tug.

14:45.081 --> 14:47.917
It really worked. Look how far I hit
the ball. I couldn't even believe it.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.212
- I'm watching you.
- Watching me? Really?

14:51.212 --> 14:54.255
There's not much to watch.
I don't really go anywhere.

14:54.255 --> 14:57.258
I'm home most of the time.
I'll do a crossword puzzle.

14:57.258 --> 14:59.678
Sometimes I'll go out to dinner.
I hate my life.

14:59.678 --> 15:01.554
You don't want to witness it.

15:01.930 --> 15:03.182
You're a real asshole.

15:03.807 --> 15:07.310
I am so deeply and profoundly sorry
for what happened.

15:07.310 --> 15:09.605
I really want to make it
up to you somehow.

15:09.605 --> 15:12.817
Let me get you a Postmates dinner.
I'll send one to your house.

15:12.817 --> 15:16.112
Would you like that? There's some
very good restaurants on Postmates.

15:16.112 --> 15:19.656
I'll have it delivered right
to your door. What did you do?

15:19.656 --> 15:21.491
- Did you tell him what I just said?
- Everything.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.076
Did you tell him about
the Postmates dinner?

15:23.076 --> 15:25.161
You just went like this.
You didn't do anything.

15:25.161 --> 15:27.372
- That's the sign.
- It took two seconds.

15:27.372 --> 15:29.457
- I'm good.
- You didn't tell him.

15:29.457 --> 15:31.918
Don't bullshit me. Why didn't you tell
him about the Postmates dinner?

15:31.918 --> 15:33.753
That's a very nice gesture!

15:33.753 --> 15:37.006
Deeply and profoundly sorry,
and you offer him Postmates?

15:37.006 --> 15:38.884
You know he didn't tell him
about the Postmates!

15:38.884 --> 15:40.761
- He told him.
- Where's my ball?

15:40.761 --> 15:42.012
I don't know.

15:42.012 --> 15:43.472
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

15:43.472 --> 15:45.307
It hit him in the back right over here!

15:45.307 --> 15:47.226
- It's up your ass, Larry!
- Where's the ball?

15:47.226 --> 15:49.894
- You took my ball?
- Go back to the tee, hit another ball!

15:49.894 --> 15:52.772
Two stroke penalty!

15:53.107 --> 15:56.277
I'm gonna just drop it over here.
I'll drop it where the body was.

15:56.277 --> 15:59.655
That's in the rules. I'm not gonna
take a penalty, I'll tell you that.

15:59.655 --> 16:01.781
I'm not taking a penalty.
I hit the ball over here.

16:01.781 --> 16:04.492
I hit one of the great shots of my life.
I'm playing from here.

16:05.995 --> 16:08.080
They threw my ball away.
I got to take a drop.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.332
- No dropping, man.
- You can't take a drop.

16:10.332 --> 16:13.376
- They threw my ball away!
- You hit somebody!

16:13.376 --> 16:16.671
He's okay.
Listen, I'm dropping a ball.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.507
Not on our watch
you're dropping a ball.

16:18.507 --> 16:19.967
I'm not going back to the tee!

16:28.309 --> 16:30.770
- What the fuck was that?
- Holy shit.

16:33.105 --> 16:36.983
- It sounds like a coyote.
- It is a coyote. They're killers, man.

16:36.983 --> 16:38.986
Sounds like he's eating a dog.

16:38.986 --> 16:40.987
Jeff, don't you live around there?

16:40.987 --> 16:43.032
That is my house.

16:43.032 --> 16:46.535
Oh my God!
That could be my puppy!

16:50.331 --> 16:52.583
You know what, Larr?
I got to go home.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.127
- What?
- That could be my dog!

16:55.127 --> 16:57.797
- Does your neighbor have a dog?
- Yeah, there's a few dogs around.

16:57.797 --> 16:59.923
So maybe one of your neighbors' dogs.

16:59.923 --> 17:01.801
That sounded like a puppy.

17:01.801 --> 17:04.804
If he's eaten, there's nothing
you can do about it.

17:04.804 --> 17:07.431
And if he's dead, what are you gonna
do, sit Shiva?

17:07.431 --> 17:09.642
Can't bring the dog back to life.

17:09.642 --> 17:11.226
We're talking about a puppy.

17:11.226 --> 17:14.354
I know, but we're on the golf
course, we're having a nice day.

17:14.354 --> 17:16.649
- You'll see it later.
- You know he's right.

17:16.649 --> 17:19.944
And if it's not, there's nothing to be
gained by going home. Let's just play.

17:19.944 --> 17:22.029
You know what? You're right.

17:22.029 --> 17:24.948
Either my puppy's dead
or it's a neighbor's dog.

17:24.948 --> 17:26.741
Nothing you could do either way.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.743
All right, I'll play.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.579
- Well, I'm dropping.
- You're not dropping.

17:30.579 --> 17:34.707
- I'm dropping.
- You are not dropping the ball!

17:34.707 --> 17:37.795
- Fuck you! I'm dropping the ball.
- You're a cheater!

17:37.795 --> 17:42.173
- No, you're a cheater.
- You're a cheater!

17:44.427 --> 17:48.264
How about the drive on 15?
What about that, huh?

17:51.266 --> 17:53.935
- Frankie!
- Look at this!

17:55.604 --> 17:58.232
- What?
- He's alive!

17:58.232 --> 18:00.441
Of course he's alive.
Why would he not be alive?

18:00.441 --> 18:06.490
We're having the game of our lives,
and we hear a coyote and then a yelp.

18:06.490 --> 18:08.992
- We heard a coyote.
- It was crazy.

18:08.992 --> 18:11.161
We thought the coyote ate the dog!

18:11.161 --> 18:12.538
You thought it was Frankie?

18:12.538 --> 18:14.539
- Yeah!
- So what did you do?

18:17.793 --> 18:21.588
What, you continued to play?

18:22.506 --> 18:25.758
- Yeah.
- You didn't come to see if he was okay?

18:27.428 --> 18:30.055
We just assumed that,
you know, he was...

18:30.055 --> 18:32.432
Dead.
And if he's dead, what can we do?

18:32.432 --> 18:35.436
This little boy, this little beautiful,
little creature is dead,

18:35.436 --> 18:40.149
and you continue to play? What kind
of heartless pieces of shit are you?

18:40.149 --> 18:42.859
We thought about the puppy
and how the puppy was dead,

18:42.859 --> 18:45.946
and we thought about golf,
and golf was there.

18:45.946 --> 18:48.364
What could we do?
There's nothing to do.

18:48.364 --> 18:51.743
Well, what about me? You didn't think
about how I was feeling at home

18:51.743 --> 18:53.578
with the coyote eating my boy?

18:53.578 --> 18:56.290
I must admit,
you didn't come into our heads.

18:56.290 --> 18:59.460
Really? You are about as selfish
as they come.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.088
And you, Larry, you have no heart.

19:02.088 --> 19:06.050
You have no soul. What if I was
maimed by a coyote?

19:06.050 --> 19:08.302
What would you do then, huh?
Would you continue playing?

19:08.302 --> 19:13.890
Certainly, I would give you more
consideration than I gave the dog.

19:13.890 --> 19:17.937
But ultimately,
I think I'd play through.

19:17.937 --> 19:20.146
You know what? Get the fuck out.
You disgust me.

19:20.146 --> 19:23.234
What do you do after
a person's dead? They're dead!

19:23.234 --> 19:27.737
Don't ever touch this dog, think
of this dog, look at this dog!

19:27.737 --> 19:31.950
No loss to me to not be involved
with your dog.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.327
Don't care.
That's no punishment at all.

19:34.327 --> 19:35.870
- Get out!
- Okay, I'll leave.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.582
But in my defense, let me just say
there are very few people I'd leave

19:38.582 --> 19:43.003
the golf course for if I found out
they died. Even you!

19:43.838 --> 19:46.090
- Really?
- Well depends how I'm playing.

19:48.925 --> 19:50.176
Coming!

19:52.804 --> 19:54.223
- Hey, Larry.
- Hello, Duane.

19:54.223 --> 19:56.724
Sorry to barge in but got the estimate
for the tree service.

19:56.724 --> 19:58.936
If you got a minute,
I'd like to talk about it.

19:58.936 --> 20:02.147
- Yeah. Come on in.
- Thanks.

20:04.232 --> 20:06.109
So, how you feeling?

20:06.109 --> 20:08.695
We're healing. Slowly.

20:08.695 --> 20:12.158
Have you had any laughs at all since?

20:12.158 --> 20:15.619
In the last 48 hours? No, not a whole
lot of laughter in the house.

20:15.619 --> 20:18.371
Just curious. I mean,
if somebody told a joke,

20:18.371 --> 20:20.874
do you think you have
the capacity to laugh?

20:20.874 --> 20:23.169
I guess it would depend
on the joke, Larry.

20:23.169 --> 20:25.212
So a funny joke could make you laugh.

20:25.212 --> 20:29.467
And provide some temporary relief
in a very painful time.

20:29.467 --> 20:32.511
Got it. Okay. Just curious.

20:32.511 --> 20:35.973
So the invoice. I got the invoice
from the tree service.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.767
They had to remove the stump too.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.144
If we could just split that
down the middle.

20:40.144 --> 20:42.938
Okay, come on. Duane.

20:42.938 --> 20:45.524
- They had to remove the stump.
- 2,700?

20:45.524 --> 20:48.152
For eating a couple of lemons a month?

20:48.152 --> 20:51.072
And that's how much it costs
to get rid of a tree.

20:51.072 --> 20:53.531
Duane, I got to tell you something, okay?

20:53.531 --> 20:56.202
This is very un-Tubman-like behavior.

20:56.202 --> 20:59.080
That's the second time with Tubmans.
I don't know what you mean.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.751
l don't think that your great
Aunt Harriet would condone this.

21:03.751 --> 21:05.377
So what kind of person was she, Larry?

21:05.377 --> 21:08.047
Well, she was the kind of person
who smuggled slaves from the South

21:08.047 --> 21:10.299
to the North and didn't charge them.

21:10.299 --> 21:11.592
Really?

21:11.592 --> 21:13.301
You know what Harriet Tubman
would have done?

21:13.301 --> 21:17.932
She would have come over to my
house with a big basket of lemons.

21:17.932 --> 21:21.060
"Larry, darling, take as many lemons
as you'd like." I'd go,

21:21.060 --> 21:23.520
"Harriet, they're dropping
into the yard. I don't need it."

21:23.520 --> 21:27.106
This has been a real education
for me on my own ancestry.

21:27.106 --> 21:29.860
This is Leon. You know Duane,
our neighbor?

21:29.860 --> 21:31.904
- What's up, D?
- How you doing, brother?

21:31.904 --> 21:33.739
He gets a "brother" right away, huh?

21:33.739 --> 21:37.159
Every Black person you meet,
you say "brother" to?

21:37.159 --> 21:39.369
You say "brother" and you give him
one of those right there.

21:39.369 --> 21:41.080
- You too?
- Respectful nod.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.082
- A nod is like our "aloha".
- I don't do a Jew nod.

21:44.082 --> 21:46.126
You guys got that song
already, "Hey, Jew".

21:46.126 --> 21:49.171
That's Hey Jude with a D.
J-U-D-E.

21:49.171 --> 21:52.758
Anyway, Duane, let's have a neighborly
adult discussion about this.

21:52.758 --> 21:57.513
I want to do the right thing here.
I can't possibly pay all this.

21:57.513 --> 22:01.100
There's some charges here that
I just can't possibly go along with.

22:01.100 --> 22:06.856
It just seems very excessive.
It's not right. It's not my tree.

22:06.856 --> 22:09.691
I'd like to think I'm a fair man.
Am I a fair man?

22:10.150 --> 22:12.611
- This is a fair man right here.
- l do the right thing, don't I?

22:12.611 --> 22:14.238
What you see is what the fuck you get.

22:15.321 --> 22:17.825
Okay, don't worry about it. I got it.
I'll see myself out.

22:17.825 --> 22:20.118
- You mean I don't have to pay?
- No, you do not.

22:20.118 --> 22:23.539
What the hell was that?
That was amazing.

22:23.539 --> 22:25.624
My boy just ran out of here.

22:27.876 --> 22:30.337
Oh my God! No, no!

22:30.337 --> 22:33.758
There they are! He saw it!

22:33.758 --> 22:37.386
That's why he rushed out of here!
He saw your boys!

22:37.386 --> 22:43.725
Those withered grotesqueries
just saved me 1,350 dollars!

22:43.725 --> 22:46.729
He lost his mind! He left!
I don't have to pay anything!

22:46.729 --> 22:49.106
That's fucked up.
All Black balls are like this.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.858
Thank you. And thank you!

22:51.858 --> 22:53.611
My balls said, "You're welcome."

22:54.986 --> 22:59.657
And he sits on the arm of the couch,
and his balls are hanging out.

23:00.367 --> 23:04.538
And the guy got so discombobulated
and takes off.

23:06.624 --> 23:08.667
My balls showed up
and saved the fucking day.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.961
That reminds me.
Remember that girl Lydia,

23:10.961 --> 23:12.630
the neighbor that I'm helping out?

23:12.630 --> 23:17.218
She is ovulating. And the bad news,
though, is I have to go up to Shasta.

23:17.218 --> 23:20.096
I got a mattress emergency, so I'm
not gonna be able to be in town.

23:20.096 --> 23:22.305
But she's asking if I know anybody.

23:22.305 --> 23:25.643
Any of you guys willing to step in
and help my neighbor out,

23:25.643 --> 23:28.020
being there for her
for her pregnancy needs?

23:28.020 --> 23:29.938
- Seriously?
- You're kidding.

23:29.938 --> 23:31.816
We're on the bench
and you're sending a reliever?

23:31.816 --> 23:33.775
You guys want to see her?
Here she is.

23:33.775 --> 23:38.238
- Beautiful.
- Let me see that. Yeah, I'd hit that.

23:38.238 --> 23:41.992
- She's fabulous. And I'm in.
- What do you got, three sperm?

23:41.992 --> 23:45.204
You can have intercourse with her
for the next 15 years.

23:45.204 --> 23:47.330
There's no way you're ever
going to impregnate her.

23:47.330 --> 23:49.375
I'll bet you 1,000 dollars
I got more sperm than you.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.377
You got more sperm than me?
In your dreams.

23:51.377 --> 23:52.877
And I will bury you with my sperm.

23:52.877 --> 23:56.047
The only problem is you can't get
someone pregnant on old-ass sperm

23:56.047 --> 23:58.133
when it's in powdered milk form.

24:00.135 --> 24:02.388
- I'm out, Leon.
- I'll tap that.

24:02.388 --> 24:06.058
Leon's in. Let me get a video here.
Hold on. I'm gonna send her this.

24:06.058 --> 24:08.853
Make it simple and make it quick.
Here we go. Ready? All right.

24:08.853 --> 24:11.396
I'm Leon Black. You know what it is.

24:11.396 --> 24:13.607
I'm looking forward to tapping
that ass. Hope you ready.

24:13.607 --> 24:16.317
And if you happen to get pregnant,
that's a bonus. How about that?

24:17.152 --> 24:19.321
Yeah, that's what's gonna happen.

24:19.321 --> 24:21.699
All right, there you go.
Let's see what she says.

24:21.699 --> 24:23.701
So just deliver about three
or four mattresses,

24:23.701 --> 24:25.286
put 'em in front of the house.

24:25.286 --> 24:27.371
That way when I wear one out,
open a new mattress,

24:27.371 --> 24:28.580
put that shit down, too.

24:28.580 --> 24:31.250
Yeah, you got to have a lot of runway
to land the plane. I understand.

24:31.916 --> 24:34.544
Okay, she got back to me.
Boy, that was quick.

24:34.544 --> 24:36.671
And she said yes
to Mr. Leon Black.

24:37.506 --> 24:40.676
- Fuck yeah.
- Congratulations.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.553
Hey, funny guy,

24:42.553 --> 24:45.389
when you hit Troy with golf ball,
you didn't say "fore".

24:45.973 --> 24:48.309
- I waved.
- Wave means what?

24:48.309 --> 24:49.518
Hello. Goodbye.

24:49.518 --> 24:52.229
But it doesn't mean "I'm going
to hit you with a golf ball".

24:52.229 --> 24:54.315
But he's deaf. He can't hear.
What was I supposed to do?

24:54.315 --> 24:56.400
And also, why you steal a lesson
from Jimmy?

24:56.400 --> 24:57.902
I didn't steal a lesson from Jimmy.

24:57.902 --> 25:02.323
It's because your golf is so terrible
nothing can help. Huh?

25:02.323 --> 25:05.743
- It's kusai.
- Kusai? What is that?

25:05.743 --> 25:07.495
Stinky.

25:07.495 --> 25:11.165
One more mistake and you're out.

25:12.624 --> 25:14.043
Enjoy.

25:18.338 --> 25:23.343
Sou desu ka.

25:31.769 --> 25:33.019
What?

25:36.982 --> 25:38.317
Baka.

25:48.910 --> 25:51.204
- Hey, what is this?
- What?

25:51.204 --> 25:54.124
Look at this.
They roped off the bench.

25:54.124 --> 25:55.709
- Because of you?
- Yeah.

25:55.709 --> 25:59.672
"Sitting prohibited during lessons"?
What an asshole! I got roped!

25:59.672 --> 26:01.298
You did get roped.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.470
- Oh, do I suck.
- At least you putted out.

26:06.470 --> 26:08.556
So sick of this game.
What a waste of time!

26:08.556 --> 26:11.558
By the way, my will? I'm going to see
an estate attorney this week,

26:11.558 --> 26:13.685
so you'll be covered.
You're set.

26:13.685 --> 26:18.482
You know, it's kind of starting to dawn
on me what's going on.

26:18.482 --> 26:19.817
What are you talking about?

26:19.817 --> 26:23.904
You're putting me in your will 'cause
you want me to put you in my will.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.740
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Is that right?

26:25.740 --> 26:28.533
Would I be that shallow and that
manipulative and clandestine?

26:28.533 --> 26:31.119
- Yes, you would. Yeah.
- That's bullshit.

26:31.119 --> 26:33.663
- This is a low point.
- It never occurred to you?

26:33.663 --> 26:37.834
Now that you mention it,
it sort of makes sense.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.795
I'll give you the same
that you give me. How's that?

26:39.795 --> 26:41.338
I'd say we do percentages.

26:41.338 --> 26:44.049
And by the way, what makes you think
that I'm gonna die before you?

26:44.049 --> 26:46.927
You're a little ragged right now.
I'm in a little better shape than you.

26:47.552 --> 26:50.055
I'm gonna outlive you by 20 years.

26:50.055 --> 26:52.057
My trainer is gonna move in with me.

26:52.057 --> 26:54.935
As soon as I get home, I'm gonna hire
a nutritionist,

26:54.935 --> 26:57.479
I'm gonna get an acupuncturist,
a masseuse.

26:57.479 --> 27:02.066
I will not have a donut for the rest
of my life, 'cause I wanna outlive you.

27:02.066 --> 27:03.861
You know what? Sugar.

27:03.861 --> 27:07.906
You cocksucker. You gave away
Wordle? You fuck. That's so low.

27:07.906 --> 27:09.742
- You deserve it.
- You sicken me.

27:09.742 --> 27:13.036
I'm gonna be waking up at five o'clock
every morning and giving Wordle away.

27:13.036 --> 27:14.913
You'll never do another Wordle
for the rest of your life.

27:14.913 --> 27:17.749
I'll wake up at four every morning
and ruin it for you.

27:17.749 --> 27:20.711
- I'll call my friend in New York!
- I'll call my friend in London!

27:20.711 --> 27:23.004
I got a friend in Israel!
What do you think about that?

27:23.004 --> 27:24.506
My friend lives on the equator!

27:31.764 --> 27:33.849
So what do you feel like's been
the common miss?

27:33.849 --> 27:36.017
I just feel like I'm using all muscle,
no technique.

27:36.017 --> 27:39.854
I'm leading with the hips
like I'm always doing, right?

27:39.854 --> 27:42.023
That's the worst advice ever
to keep your head down.

27:42.023 --> 27:44.527
You got to release the head, okay?
Then the hips.

27:44.527 --> 27:46.362
Everything comes after that,
all right?

27:46.362 --> 27:49.072
Soften it all up,
and we're gonna take it up to the top.

27:52.576 --> 27:55.663
And then with the head.
What are you looking at?

27:55.663 --> 27:58.414
Unbelievable. Larry, I see you in there.

27:58.414 --> 27:59.917
- What?
- Stealing another lesson!

27:59.917 --> 28:02.085
I'm not stealing a lesson,
I'm using the bathroom!

28:02.085 --> 28:04.420
Just a master of deception
and subterfuge.

28:04.420 --> 28:07.716
I was here first! I don't even know
what you're talking about!

28:07.716 --> 28:09.926
Yeah, you're here first 'cause
you're creeping and peeping!

28:09.926 --> 28:11.719
You owe me two lessons.

28:11.719 --> 28:15.015
And that's not even a lesson! What,
are you telling him to pick his head up?

28:15.015 --> 28:16.517
Everybody says
to put their head down.

28:16.517 --> 28:17.934
You got to release the head.

28:17.934 --> 28:19.979
Who doesn't look at the ball,
you fucking idiot

28:19.979 --> 28:21.814
Mr. Takahashi's going to hear
about this one.

28:21.814 --> 28:23.816
Tell him. I don't give a shit.

28:23.816 --> 28:25.024
Let's get out of here.

28:25.024 --> 28:28.695
"Don't look at the ball!"
Give me a break! Moron!

28:29.404 --> 28:30.823
Is he the cutest, Cheryl?

28:32.742 --> 28:35.327
I had it custom made. It's open!

28:35.660 --> 28:37.621
- He's pooping?
- His poops are gorgeous.

28:37.621 --> 28:39.957
I mean, the most beautifully
formed poops.

28:39.957 --> 28:41.666
Hey, Larr. What's up?

28:41.666 --> 28:45.504
Came to use the Theragun. I injured
my groin with this new swing.

28:45.504 --> 28:47.672
- The what?
- The Theragun. My birthday gift?

28:47.672 --> 28:51.134
It's down right where
you left it last time.

28:51.134 --> 28:54.013
So he's some kind of genius
or something, I'm not kidding.

28:54.013 --> 28:57.141
- The dog has such a high IQ.
- He's a regular Einstein.

28:58.391 --> 29:02.520
Auntie Cheryl and Uncle Ted.
He is a smart puppy.

29:04.397 --> 29:09.068
Oh my God, this thing is fantastic.
What a relief.

29:09.068 --> 29:11.613
Isn't that something
you should be doing in private?

29:11.613 --> 29:14.741
I got pants on.
What are you talking about?

29:14.741 --> 29:17.286
Frankie, what's the matter?
That's scaring him.

29:17.286 --> 29:19.704
- Hey, shut the fuck up.
- Don't you talk to my dog that way!

29:19.704 --> 29:22.123
But it's already getting better.
I feel it loosening up.

29:22.123 --> 29:24.543
- All right, good for you.
- You want to try it?

29:24.543 --> 29:26.921
- No. Get that away from me.
- You wanna try it?

29:26.921 --> 29:29.298
You just rubbed it on your balls.
No, thank you.

29:29.298 --> 29:32.550
Hey, an old man like you, you should
be using this. It's really good.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.844
You know, we heard about you
on the golf course,

29:34.844 --> 29:36.889
with the coyote and Frankie thing.

29:36.889 --> 29:41.142
So? It's not my dog. I was playing golf.
I wanted to finish the round.

29:41.142 --> 29:42.311
That's so selfish.

29:42.311 --> 29:45.313
What was I gonna do, give the dog
mouth to mouth resuscitation?

29:45.313 --> 29:48.691
Well, you could stop golfing
and make sure the dog is alive.

29:48.691 --> 29:51.277
That's like what a human being
would do.

29:51.277 --> 29:53.947
What am I supposed to do, go to his
funeral? I mean, I don't understand.

29:53.947 --> 29:58.076
I think you were hoping that Frankie
was dead because you were jealous.

29:58.076 --> 30:00.329
That's lunacy.
"I hope the dog is dead."

30:00.329 --> 30:02.205
What do I give a shit
about a dumb little dog?

30:02.205 --> 30:05.960
You're jealous because we gave Susie
a gift that means something to her,

30:05.960 --> 30:08.838
and you gave that stupid
thigh jackhammer.

30:09.422 --> 30:12.966
- I mean, really?
- Turn that off while we're talking.

30:12.966 --> 30:14.927
Go to the bathroom and do it.

30:14.927 --> 30:17.137
You always have to be the center
of attention, man.

30:17.137 --> 30:19.056
Center of attention?
I don't understand.

30:19.056 --> 30:21.558
Atlanta. Come on. Really?

30:21.558 --> 30:23.143
You know what I think?

30:23.143 --> 30:27.772
I think you're jealous that
I'm the one who got arrested in Atlanta

30:28.773 --> 30:30.859
and I'm getting all this attention.

30:30.859 --> 30:32.694
You know what?
Yeah, I am jealous.

30:32.694 --> 30:34.488
- Yeah, I know you are.
- You know why?

30:34.488 --> 30:35.990
I should have been the one
who was arrested

30:35.990 --> 30:39.284
because I use it as a platform
for the good of the planet.

30:39.284 --> 30:41.245
Use it for the good of your publicist.

30:41.245 --> 30:43.997
He's authentic.
He cares about people.

30:44.582 --> 30:47.083
I'm authentic.
I care about myself.

30:47.083 --> 30:48.461
And only yourself.

30:48.461 --> 30:51.546
There's an authenticity involved
in caring about oneself.

30:51.546 --> 30:54.632
- Oh my God.
- Is that unbelievable?

30:54.632 --> 30:58.137
Hey, you know what, Mr. Danson?
I got one word to say to you.

30:58.137 --> 31:02.057
- Sugar!
- What does that mean?

31:02.057 --> 31:03.183
I got it in two.

31:03.183 --> 31:05.894
That's Wordle?
You gave away todays Wordle?

31:05.894 --> 31:08.063
I didn't do it yet, you fucking
piece of shit!

31:08.063 --> 31:09.648
You've crossed the line now, mister.

31:09.648 --> 31:13.109
Take your crappy, mediocre gift
and get the fuck out of my house!

31:13.109 --> 31:15.071
Cause I'm not going to use
that piece of shit.

31:15.071 --> 31:16.697
Two, Larry. Got it in two.

31:16.697 --> 31:21.327
I'll take my fantastic gift that just
healed an injury in one minute!

31:21.327 --> 31:24.037
And by the way, you didn't get Wordle
in two.

31:24.037 --> 31:28.167
- You're full of shit. Wordle in two.
- Ted is smart.

31:28.167 --> 31:30.126
Wait, let me say goodbye
to your stupid fucking dog.

31:30.126 --> 31:33.213
- Don't you touch that dog.
- Do not touch the dog.

31:33.213 --> 31:36.008
My ass. You never got anything in two!

31:36.008 --> 31:39.010
He didn't have a groin injury.
His groin's perfectly fine.

31:39.761 --> 31:41.805
- Hey, there's no charger.
- Just go!

31:41.805 --> 31:44.308
Let me tell you something,
and this goes for all of you.

31:44.308 --> 31:46.852
You're gonna be injured one day,
probably pretty soon.

31:46.852 --> 31:49.896
Don't ask to use my Theragun.
You're not getting it. Just know that.

31:50.856 --> 31:53.525
Go!
And don't come back!

32:08.915 --> 32:10.584
Hey. You want this?

32:11.877 --> 32:13.712
No, no, no, don't get up!

32:20.010 --> 32:21.262
Fore.

32:23.054 --> 32:25.683
- One!
- Sorry.

32:34.567 --> 32:37.194
Stop flip, flipping.
What are we gonna watch?

32:37.194 --> 32:39.572
Let's just make a decision, you know?

32:42.574 --> 32:44.659
- Sienna Miller.
- Who?

32:44.659 --> 32:45.910
Sienna Miller.

32:45.910 --> 32:48.372
There's a documentary I really want
to watch

32:48.372 --> 32:53.251
about endangered Californian
wildlife, the San Diego fairy shrimp.

32:53.251 --> 32:55.254
Give me five minutes. I just wanna
watch five minutes.

32:55.254 --> 32:57.298
Two minutes. Three minutes.

33:01.677 --> 33:04.471
My hammer toe is getting so bad.

33:05.221 --> 33:08.933
It kind of helps, but I don't want
to have surgery at six weeks.

33:08.933 --> 33:10.435
Got to wear a boot.

33:11.269 --> 33:14.023
And it's time to shave my corns again.

33:14.023 --> 33:15.982
My podiatrist, what an idiot.

33:15.982 --> 33:17.818
Could you push that on for me?

33:17.818 --> 33:21.654
For God's sake, protect my callus.
It's so painful.

33:25.159 --> 33:27.787
- You must be the Harringtons.
- I'm Lydia.

33:27.787 --> 33:29.245
- I'm Ron.
- I'm Larry.

33:29.245 --> 33:32.541
- Larry, nice to meet you.
- Come on in, please.

33:32.541 --> 33:35.586
- It's pretty nasty out.
- It doesn't feel like L.A.

33:36.128 --> 33:38.798
Leon!

33:40.341 --> 33:42.717
- Help yourself to some tea.
- Thank you.

33:42.717 --> 33:44.844
Very kind. Thank you so much.

33:44.844 --> 33:46.721
This is really nice of you to broker
this for us.

33:46.721 --> 33:49.975
- Whatever I can do to help.
- Thank you.

33:49.975 --> 33:52.977
There he is!
This is Leon.

33:52.977 --> 33:54.939
- Hi. I'm Lydia.
- Hey, Lydia.

33:54.939 --> 33:57.065
Hey. Ron. How are you, Leon?

33:57.065 --> 33:59.484
That sounds sexy. I love those
one-syllable names.

33:59.484 --> 34:02.570
Except Lydia has three syllables,
not one.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.197
Now you're doing fucking
math right now?

34:04.197 --> 34:07.368
- I call her Dee sometimes.
- Hey, problem fucking solved.

34:08.202 --> 34:10.287
So you two are interested
in starting a family.

34:10.287 --> 34:13.289
- We want to expand our family.
- We already have a little one.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.168
- We have a small dog.
- Yeah, Mabel.

34:17.168 --> 34:20.046
- It's like she's a person.
- She's not a person. She's a dog.

34:20.046 --> 34:21.631
She's very much like a little person.

34:21.631 --> 34:23.424
And what can she do
that a person does?

34:23.424 --> 34:26.094
What Larry's saying is that a dog
cannot be a person

34:26.094 --> 34:27.972
'cause a dog can't do what people do.

34:27.972 --> 34:31.266
Now, people can do dog-like shit.
Like, a contortionist in the circus?

34:31.266 --> 34:34.478
This motherfucker can bend
his body up and lick his own balls.

34:34.478 --> 34:36.688
Do you think that motherfucker
can't lick his own nuts?

34:36.688 --> 34:37.857
Of course he can.

34:38.857 --> 34:41.610
- Can you excuse us for one second?
- Of course.

34:42.235 --> 34:45.280
If you want to fuck this woman,
I suggest you shut up,

34:45.280 --> 34:48.992
because every time you open your
mouth, you're hurting your chances.

34:48.992 --> 34:52.412
Let me tell you something right now.
I'm the dick salesman right now, right?

34:52.412 --> 34:55.999
My dick is on the market, okay?
Let me sell this motherfucking car.

34:57.292 --> 34:59.837
Well, Leon, thank you
so much for doing this.

34:59.837 --> 35:01.422
We are so excited.

35:01.422 --> 35:04.717
And thank you for giving my dick
the opportunity to serve you.

35:04.717 --> 35:07.010
- So we have a window here.
- I'm ovulating.

35:07.010 --> 35:09.053
Yeah, so if you have any questions
for us...

35:09.053 --> 35:11.307
Do you guys want a girl?
'Cause if you do,

35:11.307 --> 35:13.475
I'ma have to start eating
a lot of mustard.

35:14.602 --> 35:15.978
My fucking sperm is strong.

35:15.978 --> 35:19.398
That little motherfucker gon' come out
with a mustache and bad credit.

35:19.398 --> 35:24.361
I would be remiss if I didn't tell you
that my IQ is 152.

35:24.361 --> 35:25.821
152?

35:26.655 --> 35:28.532
And my mother was Miss Bensonhurst.

35:28.532 --> 35:31.368
That's very impressive, Larry, but
your services won't be necessary.

35:31.368 --> 35:35.956
Just FYI, I don't know if you guys ever
heard of the big Johnson community.

35:35.956 --> 35:38.459
All right. I think we're good here.

35:38.459 --> 35:39.834
Thank you so much, Leon.

35:39.834 --> 35:42.086
- All right, well, so long!
- Nice meeting you.

35:42.086 --> 35:45.715
Can I give you a little tip?
Keep those eyes closed.

35:45.715 --> 35:47.551
Thank you. Bye.

35:48.134 --> 35:50.012
Well, we gotta get home to Mabel,

35:50.012 --> 35:52.098
but I have your number,
and I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah?

35:52.098 --> 35:53.641
Give me a call.
And you get some sleep.

35:53.641 --> 35:56.268
You're gonna need it.
Tap that ass tomorrow.

35:56.268 --> 35:58.728
Thank you.
No masturbating.

35:58.728 --> 36:00.104
Hey, you neither.

36:01.189 --> 36:04.151
- No masturbating.
- Fuck is she, the cum police?

36:05.277 --> 36:08.530
"Mr. Takahashi would like to see you
in his office tomorrow."

36:08.530 --> 36:09.572
Shit!

36:10.282 --> 36:14.244
You know what that means? I'm gonna
get kicked out of the club. This is it.

36:14.744 --> 36:16.205
There's Duane.

36:22.544 --> 36:24.505
Booker, let's go. Come on.

36:25.589 --> 36:28.967
Motherfucker ain't even nod his head.
This fucking guy.

36:28.967 --> 36:30.261
What's his problem?

36:39.269 --> 36:40.436
Come in!

36:41.272 --> 36:43.858
You are in big trouble.

36:44.316 --> 36:47.610
I hear you no longer
the funny guy.

36:47.610 --> 36:50.489
You are the cheap and violent guy.

36:50.489 --> 36:54.909
First you hit Academy Award
winner Troy with golf ball.

36:55.535 --> 36:59.205
And then, you hit him with bagel!
What do you have to say for yourself?

36:59.205 --> 37:02.460
Okay. First of all, the night before

37:02.460 --> 37:04.170
I didn't have a very good night's sleep.

37:04.170 --> 37:07.422
I'm dreaming I'm in a fish tank
with a lot of little guppies around me

37:07.422 --> 37:09.800
and goldfish,
and they're all pecking at me.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.386
Pecking, pecking, pecking.
They weren't hurting me.

37:12.386 --> 37:15.847
And then in the morning, I'm going,
"I wonder why I had that dream."

37:15.847 --> 37:18.601
"Is it because I said
I don't really like salmon?"

37:18.601 --> 37:22.020
I never said anything else about fish.
And so, I'm exhausted.

37:22.020 --> 37:26.232
And I go to the driving range that
morning, and I'm sitting on the bench.

37:26.232 --> 37:28.359
I'm thinking about what I'm going
to have for lunch.

37:28.359 --> 37:29.861
I'm not gonna have fish, I know that.

37:29.861 --> 37:33.448
Then I hear Jimmy. He's giving
a lesson. Vertical drop, horizontal tug.

37:33.448 --> 37:35.409
Okay. Stop! No more!

37:37.036 --> 37:38.203
What's that?

37:40.205 --> 37:43.125
- Get out!
- Can do, Mr. T. Got it.

37:43.541 --> 37:46.796
Go away. I don't want to see
any part of you. Go!

37:46.796 --> 37:48.254
Arigato.

37:49.172 --> 37:50.382
Baka.

38:02.561 --> 38:04.771
What was that?
Was that a coyote?

38:06.607 --> 38:08.734
Mabel? Did you hear a dog?

38:08.734 --> 38:09.819
I didn't hear shit.
