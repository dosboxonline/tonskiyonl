WEBVTT

02:12.791 --> 02:15.583
The shipment is already in transit.

02:18.250 --> 02:22.708
Let's just say that might have
regrettable consequences.

02:32.416 --> 02:35.250
I wouldn't. Open your safe.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.125
I'll pay you a lot of money to walk away.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.583
Shut up. Open the safe.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.333
- Who do you work for? CIA?
- Hurry up.

03:00.458 --> 03:01.708
Kill her!

03:16.541 --> 03:17.708
Someone!

04:02.875 --> 04:04.916
Don't walk! Quick!

04:04.916 --> 04:06.791
The woman's up there!

04:08.416 --> 04:10.833
Up there! Kill her!

04:24.958 --> 04:27.125
Catch that bitch!

06:18.208 --> 06:21.375
Come on.
We both know how long these things take.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.000
We need get it through customs.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.833
Now, I'm working
on getting another shipment.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.625
But without the support
from the consulate at the UN

06:28.625 --> 06:30.916
we have no chance
of that happening on time.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.250
I know, but we don't have time for that.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.125
They're in the middle
of a malaria outbreak.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.875
I'm working on another shipment,

06:38.875 --> 06:41.833
but we have to get
what we have through customs now.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.791
I'm gonna call you back.

06:45.541 --> 06:46.375
Hey, you.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.250
Are you early or am I late?

06:52.458 --> 06:53.333
Hey.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.833
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

06:57.708 --> 07:01.291
Happy anniversary. Come see.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.375
- Wait, that's too much.
- When we went on that wine run,

07:17.375 --> 07:19.958
it was in the shop next door.
I saw you looking at it.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.875
- My turn.
- No, no, no.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.583
I need a redo gift.
I'm embarrassed. No, no, no.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.458
My... My... My gift.

07:29.541 --> 07:31.708
Big in Japan.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.958
I love 'em.
They're my new favourite pant.

07:34.875 --> 07:38.375
Although I do think that year two
is cotton. Three is leather.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.250
Oh, you're so much better
at this than me.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.166
Try this.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.291
Wow. You really cracked out
the good stuff.

07:49.791 --> 07:52.250
You're too good to me,
you know that?

07:54.833 --> 07:58.791
Ain't it great?
And this is the last piece.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.666
- Ah! How cute.
- They need a home.

08:03.666 --> 08:07.708
Think about their little tails wagging.
Their hot breath on you in the morning.

08:07.708 --> 08:12.125
No, no, I can't. I can't be trusted
to keep something alive.

08:12.916 --> 08:15.583
I almost killed the both of us
with that omelette I made.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.916
Well, they only eat kibble,
so you'll be fine.

08:19.125 --> 08:22.291
Don't worry. We'll build up to it.
Let's get you fed.

08:22.291 --> 08:28.291
No. Can I please just take you to
dinner? My treat. I got to redeem myself.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.833
I love the pants.
I'm gonna wear them to dinner.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.166
- Okay.
- Let's go.

08:36.541 --> 08:39.291
Hm. This is an interesting route
to the restaurant.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.625
-  Oh, really?
-  Yeah.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.625
Feels like it's almost intentionally
out of the way.

08:42.625 --> 08:47.375
- That's just in your head.
- Obviously, I have Alzheimer's.

08:48.708 --> 08:54.625
Okay. I'm on to you. Sneaky way
to the proposal spot. Romantic stroll.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.625
You really want that puppy, huh?

08:56.625 --> 08:58.250
I have no idea what you're talking about.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.375
- I resent all these accusations.
- You're the sickest person.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.875
Do you remember that dinner we had

09:02.875 --> 09:05.750
- with that German doctor we met in Iraq?
- Mm-hm.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.916
He and I are going to New York
in a few weeks to raise some funds

09:08.916 --> 09:12.000
and recruit some doctors.
And I thought you could come.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.166
Finally take a proper holiday.

09:14.166 --> 09:18.208
An actual vacation together.
It's been so long. I would love that.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.666
Great.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.916
It'd be great. You could show us
all your old college stomping grounds.

09:23.916 --> 09:27.083
First kiss. Your first everything.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.000
We're gonna need a longer vacation.

09:30.625 --> 09:34.208
Besides my glory days,
what else is on the touristy menu?

09:34.208 --> 09:37.166
Well, I'm still working out
some of the finer details.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.791
-  Which are?
-  Like the Chelsea Hotel,

09:39.791 --> 09:41.666
champagne, clothing optional.

09:41.666 --> 09:44.708
Mm, okay.
Now you're piquing my interest.

09:47.541 --> 09:50.333
-  Babe, is my phone out there?
- Yeah.

09:53.916 --> 09:56.666
- You feeling all right?
- I am tired.

09:57.166 --> 09:59.208
Trip took it out of me a little bit.

10:01.916 --> 10:05.291
Why don't you stay home
from work today? Work from home?

10:05.291 --> 10:09.500
I mean, bed. I mean...
I mean, let's just go back to bed.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.041
That sounds so good.
I'd almost kill for that.

10:15.125 --> 10:18.416
- Do you have plans this weekend?
- Not set in stone.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.625
Okay. Don't make any.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.125
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.208
Hey, how was the trip?

10:50.208 --> 10:53.875
Views were incredible. Some of
the people could have been friendlier.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.083
Hm. And the client?

10:56.083 --> 10:57.833
Oh, I left him speechless.

10:59.083 --> 11:02.083
- Hmm.
- Hmm. Oh.

11:02.708 --> 11:07.791
Hey, a token of my appreciation.
For everything.

11:07.791 --> 11:10.208
Ave, you shouldn't have.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.041
- Oh!
- Don't worry. It's a knock-off.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.708
It's beautiful. Thank you.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.583
Thanks. How's Maggie?

11:19.583 --> 11:23.958
Homesick. Lucky you married
a European. How are you and David?

11:24.958 --> 11:29.500
Great. Except my anniversary gift
was a disaster.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.750
Why didn't you tell me
there was some kind of gift list thing?

11:33.750 --> 11:35.250
There is?

11:36.416 --> 11:38.333
Next year's fruit.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.416
Hey, don't beat yourself up.
You're doing fine.

11:41.416 --> 11:44.291
Every marriage takes effort,
especially in our world.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.625
You got plenty of time
to work out the kinks.

11:46.625 --> 11:51.250
I tell you what. Why don't you let David
and I take you and Maggie for dinner?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.958
Maybe she can share
some marriage pointers with me.

11:53.958 --> 11:57.125
Oh, I'm sure she's got a whole bunch.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.666
I'm proud of you, Ave.

12:00.666 --> 12:02.708
We've come a long way
since Kandahar.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.166
- Blake.
-  Yes, sir.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.166
We have lots to discuss.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.750
Pull up the files Avery got from Japan.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.000
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go private and fire it up.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.666
Pull up the intel in Kenji's black book.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.083
Business firms
used for weapon shipments.

12:29.083 --> 12:33.291
Officials he was paying off.
Terrorist networks he was supplying.

12:33.291 --> 12:38.208
But the drive had a lot more than that
on it. Kali fulfilled a contract for him.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.750
He's been deviating from his M.O.
for the last year.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.458
Pull up the Triad file.

12:43.166 --> 12:48.375
When you were in Japan, this went down
in Krakow, courtesy of the Russian mob.

12:48.375 --> 12:51.708
Looks like the Triads were encroaching
on their customers.

12:52.625 --> 12:53.791
Guess who's responsible?

12:53.791 --> 12:56.416
Kali did another hit for the Russians?

12:56.416 --> 12:59.625
Why is a top assassin solely taking
contracts for the Russian mob?

12:59.625 --> 13:03.541
He also put a bullet in the head of
two undercover agents in South Africa.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.166
Maybe this will help us identify him.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.666
That would be one hell of a coup.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.708
Good work, Agent Graves.

13:13.708 --> 13:16.250
Finish your report,
and take the rest of the day.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.958
Thank you, sir.

13:22.958 --> 13:25.625
- Pull up Kali's file.
-  Yes, ma'am.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.291
Arms dealers, drug runners.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.750
All low grade targets.

13:42.541 --> 13:44.750
Why are you deviating?

13:50.416 --> 13:53.041
- Hi, neighbour.
- Hey, Abby.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.500
Missed you at the gym
the last few days.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.791
- Business trip.
- I'm jealous.

13:57.791 --> 13:59.958
Hey, where did you go?
Someplace fun?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
- Hi, Avery.
- Niklaus.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.583
Missed you at the gym.

14:04.583 --> 14:07.291
Hey, you and David want to come over
for dinner this weekend?

14:08.958 --> 14:10.666
We have plans.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.458
Don't be a stranger.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.291
Hey, I'm home.

14:20.416 --> 14:21.708
Honey?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.333
Hey, I've been thinking
about our New York trip.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.041
I've got a few ideas.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.041
Who is this?

15:14.291 --> 15:16.916
<i>You're home early, Agent Graves.</i>

15:16.916 --> 15:18.291
Where's my husband?

15:18.291 --> 15:21.208
<i>Located in your sister CIA black site</i>

15:21.208 --> 15:26.125
<i>is detainee number 0912749.</i>

15:26.125 --> 15:31.791
Hidden in his fake tooth is a file.
You are going to steal it for me.

15:32.583 --> 15:37.208
<i>You have nine hours to get me what I want
if you want to see your husband alive.</i>

15:37.208 --> 15:39.166
I want proof of life.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.791
<i>Once you have the file.</i>

15:40.791 --> 15:45.958
No. Proof of life or he's already dead.
And this phone call is over.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.666
<i>Avery...</i>

15:49.583 --> 15:51.333
David, listen to me!

15:52.666 --> 15:54.375
<i>There's your proof.</i>

15:55.500 --> 16:00.041
You touch him again, I will break
every bone in your fucking body.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.500
There's a phone booth in an alleyway.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.666
It will ring at midnight.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.875
If you don't answer it
with the Canary Black file in hand,

16:09.875 --> 16:11.750
<i>your husband dies.</i>

16:11.750 --> 16:15.625
<i>Failure to comply, as well as
any involvement from your agency,</i>

16:15.625 --> 16:18.375
<i>will result in his execution.</i>

16:35.583 --> 16:37.958
- Hello?
-  <i>Sorina, it's me.</i>

16:37.958 --> 16:40.708
<i>- I need a favour.</i>
- Fuck your favours.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.458
A favour is a ride to the airport.
Not the usual bullshit you ask me to do.

16:44.458 --> 16:46.125
You're a hacker.

16:46.125 --> 16:49.333
Don't pretend just because you got
a real job, you suddenly have morals.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.458
I'm at work.
Call one of your agency hacks.

16:54.583 --> 16:58.708
No, this needs to be off the books.
Are you gonna do it?

16:58.708 --> 17:02.541
Or am I telling the Russian FSB
about the time you hacked their servers?

17:04.000 --> 17:04.916
<i>Good.</i>

17:05.958 --> 17:09.541
I need you to ping the location of
the last incoming call to this cell phone.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.083
Hang on.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.416
The phone's a burner.
It's on the south side.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.833
But I need more time
to triangulate the exact location.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.333
As soon as I have it,
I'll text you the address.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.583
So, are we good?

17:34.583 --> 17:36.458
<i>Hurry.</i>

17:44.291 --> 17:47.708
I sent you home early so you could
at least pretend to have a life.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.625
You know me.

18:02.541 --> 18:05.333
09... 749.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.708
Come on, please.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.791
Yeah.

19:45.791 --> 19:49.083
<i>You're not following
my instructions, Agent Graves.</i>

19:49.083 --> 19:51.750
Well, that's a character flaw of mine.

19:51.750 --> 19:55.208
You think I didn't know
that you'd try to trace the call?

19:55.208 --> 19:59.041
<i>You just stepped on a pressure
activated explosive device.</i>

19:59.041 --> 20:02.000
<i>Take a step and you lose your life.</i>

20:02.750 --> 20:05.916
- I'm listening.
<i>- Then do exactly as you're told.</i>

20:09.416 --> 20:13.875
Your psych file is quite a read,
Agent Graves. "Psychologically astute.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.000
"Prone to self-reliance,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.750
<i>"she's uniquely suitable as a lone wolf
due to her lack of a family unit</i>

20:19.750 --> 20:23.625
<i>"and comfortability with high pressure
situations and covert identities.</i>

20:23.625 --> 20:27.250
"And a case history
of zero failed missions."

20:27.250 --> 20:30.583
If anyone can get me the file, it's you.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.791
So now that we've bonded, I'm assuming
you're gonna disarm this bomb.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.708
<i>There is a price
for disobeying instructions.</i>

20:37.208 --> 20:38.916
You're expendable.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.833
Show me progress
and get me Canary Black.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.625
Get to work, Agent Graves.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.875
Tick tock.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.833
Bouncing Betty, you asshole.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Can I help you, Agent Graves?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.416
I need to talk to Agent Maxfield.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.875
Service weapon.
Security protocol.

23:42.875 --> 23:44.708
No outside weapons on site.

24:06.666 --> 24:07.958
Maxfield.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.333
What can I do for you, Agent Graves?

24:15.333 --> 24:19.291
I believe detainee CPD0912749

24:19.291 --> 24:22.541
has actionable intel
related to the case I'm assigned to.

24:22.541 --> 24:25.708
I highly doubt that.
He's way above your pay grade.

24:25.708 --> 24:30.458
An arms dealer tried to bargain with intel
he says he received from your detainee.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.416
What intel?

24:32.416 --> 24:34.875
He said it involved
an assassin named Kali.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.041
I need to know what his connection is.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.708
What did this detainee do exactly?

24:44.708 --> 24:49.583
He got his hands on a top secret,
sensitive compartmented information file.

24:49.583 --> 24:52.708
The scope of this breach is deadly.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.333
What's he doing here?

24:54.333 --> 24:57.291
Enjoying fewer rights
than if we took him to Guantanamo.

24:57.291 --> 25:00.500
You don't get answers
by asking politely with a lawyer present.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.458
We renditioned him here after we
caught him trying to get to Odessa.

25:03.916 --> 25:08.500
You guys probably have baggage then.
Might be faster if I go in by myself.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.291
I'll be in the other room... monitoring.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.125
Mr Stoica.

25:24.750 --> 25:28.041
I recently met with
a friend of yours in Japan.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.750
Kenji Nakajima.

25:31.666 --> 25:33.291
I don't know who that is.

25:33.291 --> 25:38.333
Well, he knows you. According to him,
you backchannelled a meeting

25:38.333 --> 25:40.041
because you had something to sell.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.208
<i>He didn't want guns.</i>

25:41.208 --> 25:42.458
Pull up Agent Graves' file.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.791
<i>He wanted cash and lots of it.</i>

25:44.791 --> 25:47.750
I can help you,
but this is a two-way street.

25:50.125 --> 25:52.375
I heard the two of you discussed a file.

25:54.958 --> 25:56.708
Canary Black.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.541
<i>Is this Agent Maxfield's idea?</i>

26:01.541 --> 26:05.125
Look around.
I'm the friendliest face in here.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.166
So why don't you tell me about the file,

26:08.541 --> 26:10.083
and then I can help you.

26:13.708 --> 26:16.166
Fuck you, you American cunt.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.083
Fuck you!

26:19.750 --> 26:20.708
Shit!

26:28.208 --> 26:29.958
I'm taking that file.

26:34.666 --> 26:36.250
Where is it?

26:36.250 --> 26:39.625
What the hell are you doing?
You don't pull that shit on my detainee.

26:39.625 --> 26:40.833
Improvising.

26:45.375 --> 26:46.375
We good?

26:49.708 --> 26:52.625
You just killed your career,
Agent Graves!

26:55.500 --> 26:57.458
Fix him up.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.958
-  <i>Go ahead.</i>
- Get me Station Chief Hedlund.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.458
<i>Okay.</i>

27:08.333 --> 27:10.416
She has the file!
Lock it down!

27:16.041 --> 27:17.583
Hey, stop!

27:21.958 --> 27:23.333
Graves, down...

27:25.833 --> 27:27.791
Don't move! Don't move!

27:27.791 --> 27:31.083
Agent Graves, only way
you're leaving here is on a stretcher.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.625
- Put the knife down.
- Not happening, Maxfield.

27:33.625 --> 27:36.541
Read the room.
Open the door. Open the door.

27:54.625 --> 27:55.750
Fuck!

27:57.041 --> 28:00.208
Hunt her down. She's a threat
to national security.

28:20.541 --> 28:22.625
- Redirect the plane.
-  Yes, sir.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.375
What the...?

28:33.625 --> 28:37.666
Deputy Director Evans.
Yes, sir. Just came over the wire now.

28:39.083 --> 28:40.250
Yes, sir.

28:51.958 --> 28:55.875
<i>Agent Maxfield, I put you in charge
of finding Canary Black,</i>

28:55.875 --> 28:58.250
<i>and it was right under your nose
the whole time.</i>

28:58.250 --> 29:00.916
<i>I need a blow by blow
of what happened. Who is she?</i>

29:00.916 --> 29:04.000
My best, sir.
Her father worked for the agency.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.333
Her mother was from the UK.

29:05.333 --> 29:09.666
Both deceased. She was groomed
since she was 18.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.666
Aced Langley,
passed the Wintertide programme

29:12.666 --> 29:15.416
and pulled the Omar Jaziri job in Iraq.

29:15.416 --> 29:17.666
There's no way that she's a traitor, sir.

29:17.666 --> 29:19.208
That's exactly what she is right now.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.458
You mark my words, Hedlund,
she's going in the ground

29:21.458 --> 29:23.166
and you're the one
that's gonna put her there.

29:24.291 --> 29:27.875
Yes, sir. What file are we after?

29:28.416 --> 29:30.041
<i>Canary Black.</i>

29:30.500 --> 29:35.708
<i>It's a top-secret master list of blackmail
material for all government personnel.</i>

29:35.708 --> 29:38.791
We built it to keep track
of pressure points

29:38.791 --> 29:41.250
foreign governments might use
to flip our people

29:41.250 --> 29:44.458
into spies.
Legal, illegal, everything.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.791
From the highest office
in the land to, uh...

29:48.208 --> 29:49.791
Well, you, Hedlund.

29:50.791 --> 29:54.375
<i>That affair you had four years ago.
It's on the list.</i>

29:56.000 --> 29:57.791
<i>If our enemies get their hands on this,</i>

29:57.791 --> 30:00.458
it will jeopardise
the very office of the president

30:00.458 --> 30:02.916
and every department below it.

30:02.916 --> 30:05.375
<i>You have carte blanche to contain this.</i>

30:34.083 --> 30:35.916
<i>I'm taking that file.</i>

30:35.916 --> 30:37.666
I don't understand.

30:37.666 --> 30:39.375
She played you, Hedlund.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.541
You're just too close to her to see it.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.333
Where would she go?

30:45.916 --> 30:47.875
She's a ghost if she wants to be.

30:47.875 --> 30:51.291
- And her husband?
- Doesn't know who she is.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.250
David Brooks, civilian.

30:53.250 --> 30:56.583
Works in logistics and finance
for Doctors Without Frontiers.

30:56.583 --> 30:59.750
A British national.
He's the only family she's got.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.375
Besides you.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.958
Okay. Bring him in.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.875
Scrape her husband's phone calls, texts,

31:09.875 --> 31:12.333
e-mails, credit cards,
and get me a map of where he's been.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.041
-  Yes, sir.
- She has to trust someone.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.625
Sir, his cell has been
off the grid for hours,

31:36.083 --> 31:38.333
and he has an ATM withdrawal
in Vienna.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.125
There was also a flight
booked this morning

31:40.125 --> 31:42.416
under his name and Miss Olga Mirav.

31:42.416 --> 31:43.583
That's one of her aliases.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.500
It leaves Vienna in three hours for Rome.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.000
He's on the run with her.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.333
- Get me teams stationed at both airports.
-  Yes, sir.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.041
Honey, this isn't the right time.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.541
It's me.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.875
<i>Someone kidnapped David.</i>

31:59.875 --> 32:02.458
They want the Canary Black file.

32:02.458 --> 32:03.916
But there was no file.

32:03.916 --> 32:05.166
<i>This could be Kali.</i>

32:05.166 --> 32:09.208
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I won't be home till late.

32:09.208 --> 32:11.291
If I could know the contents,

32:11.291 --> 32:14.500
<i>maybe I can figure out who has David,
but it's beyond my clearance.</i>

32:15.000 --> 32:18.041
You know,
you really should get some rest.

32:18.916 --> 32:21.708
This file is the only chance I have
of saving him.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.958
Hey, don't worry about the dishes.
I'll do them when I get home.

32:24.958 --> 32:28.125
Go to my house. See for yourself.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.375
Yeah.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.125
I am not a traitor.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.958
Love you, too.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.583
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.458
It's the wife.
A bit under the weather.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.500
It's okay, Maggie.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.875
I'm sure Jarvis will sort it out.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.333
I have a set...

33:33.291 --> 33:34.541
of keys.

33:35.208 --> 33:36.541
Downstairs.

33:57.125 --> 34:00.416
Ever consider the husband
was taken and the file is a ransom?

34:00.416 --> 34:02.291
All this is a setup.

34:02.291 --> 34:05.083
If that were the case,
she would have brought us in.

34:05.083 --> 34:07.541
Rule number one
for a kidnap and ransom.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.416
Tear this place apart.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.291
You weren't answering your phone.

34:47.291 --> 34:49.541
So you show up in person?

34:49.541 --> 34:52.833
I need your help. Please.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.000
I don't conduct business here.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.375
I don't have time for decorum.
I'm fucked.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.791
By who?

35:12.791 --> 35:17.833
By whoever's blackmailing me.
And now my own agency, which is nice.

35:17.833 --> 35:20.833
- And you're looking for safe passage?
- Information.

35:20.833 --> 35:24.083
Get me a list of every foreign agent,
assassin and intel broker

35:24.083 --> 35:26.666
- that's currently in town.
- That's expensive.

35:26.666 --> 35:30.208
I have the cash in my safe house.
I'll pay you when it's done.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.041
Also, I need you to go shopping.

35:34.583 --> 35:40.875
Avery, coming here you're burning
a bridge. I hope it's worth it.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.041
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

37:20.833 --> 37:23.166
I'd ask him,
but there's a hole in his face.

37:23.166 --> 37:28.250
<i>Well, well, well.
Aren't we ambitious, Agent Graves?</i>

37:29.083 --> 37:31.750
<i>Looks like I chose
the right woman for the job.</i>

37:31.750 --> 37:34.083
Just trying to crack that glass ceiling.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.708
<i>I took the liberty
of cashing out your rainy day fund.</i>

37:37.625 --> 37:40.416
<i>Consider it a tax for jerking me around.</i>

37:45.291 --> 37:48.791
<i>- Bring me the file.</i>
- Your intel was wrong. There was no file.

37:48.791 --> 37:51.750
<i>Are you sure
that's the game you want to play?</i>

37:51.750 --> 37:53.708
Look, the tooth was empty.

37:53.708 --> 37:56.375
Either you got it wrong or he ditched it
before they caught him.

37:59.458 --> 38:00.416
Hello?

38:10.333 --> 38:14.708
Listen to me. Listen to me!
I don't have it, but I can get it.

38:14.708 --> 38:16.166
I just need some time.

38:16.166 --> 38:18.958
<i>Stoica had the file,
which means you have the file,</i>

38:18.958 --> 38:23.583
<i>which is why your agency is after you.
It's 8:00 pm. That gives you four hours.</i>

38:25.125 --> 38:27.333
No, I need more...

39:11.500 --> 39:13.666
Jesus Christ, Avery,
this is one hell of a mess.

39:13.666 --> 39:14.958
I couldn't involve you.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.375
You know that's impossible.

39:16.375 --> 39:20.166
I had no choice.
They have my classified psych file.

39:20.166 --> 39:22.250
They know everything about me.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.625
Everyone's looking for you.

39:24.625 --> 39:28.041
Deputy Director himself is flying in
to oversee the hunt.

39:28.041 --> 39:30.708
Your house was clean.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.375
David's made transactions in Vienna.

39:33.375 --> 39:37.375
He bought two tickets, one with
your alias and we can't find him.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.416
- Because he's been kidnapped.
- It's not the way it looks.

39:40.416 --> 39:43.500
Of course, it's not how it looks.
It's how they want it to look.

39:44.416 --> 39:47.833
They're setting me up to take the fall.
What the fuck is Canary Black?

39:48.416 --> 39:50.375
It's a blackmail list.

39:50.375 --> 39:53.458
The kompromat on everyone
in government with security clearance.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.541
I'm on that list, Avery.

39:57.166 --> 39:59.041
Even if you did have the file,

39:59.041 --> 40:01.500
you couldn't make the exchange,
you know that.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.375
- But, David...
- I know.

40:05.541 --> 40:07.958
People like us need people
like David and Maggie.

40:07.958 --> 40:11.416
- I can't lose him, Jarvis.
- We'll find him.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.625
You've just got David killed.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.083
They were gonna kill you.
I won't let that happen.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.750
On the ground, now!

40:25.666 --> 40:26.958
Get the fuck off me.

40:29.208 --> 40:32.458
- Give me the file.
- I never had it.

40:32.458 --> 40:33.708
Let's go.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.916
Did you already make the transfer?

41:03.916 --> 41:05.541
Who were you working with?

41:05.541 --> 41:09.458
Who's the buyer? How did you know
about the file? Answer me!

41:11.958 --> 41:15.000
I'm gonna take pleasure
in breaking you down, traitor.

41:15.916 --> 41:17.750
How patriotic of you.

41:37.791 --> 41:39.416
Shit. Shit.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.333
<i>Maxfield, we got company.</i>

41:44.500 --> 41:47.833
Get us to base camp.
Protect the asset at all cost.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.083
<i>They're boxing us in.</i>

41:58.125 --> 41:59.125
Get us out of here.

42:14.458 --> 42:16.458
-  Don't stop!
-  <i>Car in pursuit.</i>

42:16.458 --> 42:18.583
<i>Requesting immediate backup.</i>

45:10.125 --> 45:11.666
Give me the file.

45:29.375 --> 45:33.875
Niklaus. Where's David?
Niklaus, where is he?

45:36.083 --> 45:39.583
Who are you working for?
Niklaus, give me a name.

45:56.416 --> 45:59.875
<i>Rurik, are you okay? Rurik, answer me.</i>

46:03.916 --> 46:08.041
By carte blanche, I didn't mean
create an international incident.

46:08.041 --> 46:10.875
I have to temper the blowback
on this now with my counterpart.

46:10.875 --> 46:14.708
It's one woman, dammit.
Just find her. We're going to the NSS.

46:20.916 --> 46:23.500
Her husband never showed
at the airport in Vienna.

46:23.500 --> 46:26.000
Like I said,
maybe she's been compromised.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.833
More like her accomplices were worried

46:27.833 --> 46:30.041
we snagged her
and her husband is in hiding.

46:30.958 --> 46:32.541
I'm not buying it.

46:32.541 --> 46:35.875
She betrayed you.
If that's not something you can handle,

46:35.875 --> 46:38.625
then I can talk to Deputy Director Evans
and have you relieved.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.083
Consider the angles.

46:40.083 --> 46:43.083
And consider why the hell
none of these people have files.

46:43.875 --> 46:47.416
Sir, police just found another body.
I'm pulling up the image.

46:51.541 --> 46:53.458
That's Avery's neighbour.

46:54.208 --> 46:56.583
Then we've got a sleeper cell
in our outfit.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.666
Your outfit.

46:59.375 --> 47:02.250
I want to know
who the hell these people are.

47:08.208 --> 47:11.041
Rurik is dead.
I should have been there.

47:12.166 --> 47:16.458
Soldiers die. That's the job.

47:23.083 --> 47:25.541
- You've failed.
- We stopped them from getting her.

47:25.541 --> 47:27.458
And now she's back on the run
with the file.

47:34.416 --> 47:35.833
Once we get the file...

47:37.791 --> 47:39.125
you'll have your revenge.

47:51.375 --> 47:53.833
Thanks for the quick turnaround
and the gear.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.708
Be thankful that I even showed.

47:57.750 --> 48:01.083
I'm told Deputy Director Evans
just flew in to personally deal with you.

48:01.750 --> 48:03.000
Good timing.

48:04.708 --> 48:06.625
Do you have a list of names for me?

48:06.625 --> 48:08.708
What's that? A tip?

48:08.708 --> 48:10.666
My safe house was torched.

48:10.666 --> 48:13.125
I don't go out of pocket for anyone.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.791
They have a knack for dying
before paying the freight.

48:17.791 --> 48:20.208
I can tell you who orchestrated
the assassination attempt

48:20.208 --> 48:21.625
on the French ambassador last month.

48:21.625 --> 48:24.750
I wouldn't be very good at my job
if I didn't already know that, would I?

48:24.750 --> 48:28.583
I can give you access to a drop box for
a Russian cell operating out of the UK.

48:28.583 --> 48:33.125
Give me the Rolls Royce of intel
or find yourself another patron saint.

48:35.208 --> 48:38.291
Kenji Nakajima's dealmaker
on the UN Security Council.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.333
Pierre Delacourt.

48:40.333 --> 48:43.708
His cut is routed through
his wife's Panamanian shell corporation.

48:47.791 --> 48:54.416
The Kruger brothers are here.
Vanya Stover, Stavros the Greek, Kali.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.791
Kali's in town?

48:55.791 --> 48:57.375
That's the rumour.

48:57.375 --> 49:00.291
They say he owes.
The Russians said that.

49:00.291 --> 49:03.458
If anybody's capable of this, it's him.

49:03.458 --> 49:06.375
There's not a debt in the world
this file couldn't pay off.

49:09.416 --> 49:10.416
What about this guy?

49:11.416 --> 49:15.041
He called himself Niklaus,
but his name's Rurik. Austrian.

49:15.041 --> 49:17.833
He and his wife were my neighbours
for the past eight months.

49:18.583 --> 49:22.125
His name is Rurik van Klaus.
Private contractor.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.583
He worked in Chechnya,
Libya, Ukraine.

49:24.583 --> 49:26.708
How does the CIA not have him on file?

49:26.708 --> 49:29.208
Ghosts live longer.

49:30.291 --> 49:32.208
I picked up your shopping list.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.333
Don't call me again.

49:58.416 --> 50:00.666
-  Deputy Director Evans?
- Yeah.

50:00.666 --> 50:03.125
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Director Breznov will see you now.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.208
- Okay, let's go. Wait here.
- Yes, sir.

50:15.541 --> 50:17.666
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.125
As you know, we have an issue
that needs containment.

50:27.208 --> 50:30.583
You have a rogue agent
on foreign soil. My soil.

50:32.166 --> 50:34.625
It's your turf.
We want to handle this diplomatically.

50:34.625 --> 50:37.125
Your agency had a gunfight
in the middle of the city.

50:37.125 --> 50:38.750
I have dead bodies, burned out cars

50:38.750 --> 50:40.958
and zero patience
for your version of events.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.958
You'll find we're very generous
to our friends.

50:46.916 --> 50:49.500
And this agent. What did she do?

50:49.500 --> 50:51.666
She stole top secret information.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.083
What exactly do you have in mind?

50:55.083 --> 50:57.083
We work together to hunt her down.

50:59.083 --> 51:02.041
In the light of bilateral cooperation
and preferential treatment,

51:02.041 --> 51:03.291
I accept your offer.

51:04.291 --> 51:07.541
But when she's caught, I want to be
the first one to interrogate her.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.958
Hello.
I'd like a room for two nights, please.

51:22.958 --> 51:25.666
And preferably
the west side of the third floor.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.375
Can't get enough of that view.

51:27.375 --> 51:31.041
- That shouldn't be a problem. Miss?
- Olivia Oxley.

53:04.958 --> 53:07.625
Stop fucking interrupting me then!

53:11.708 --> 53:12.875
Keep up appearances.

53:12.875 --> 53:15.166
Anyone asks,
it's a pre-scheduled meeting with Breznov

53:15.166 --> 53:17.333
regarding international
intelligence protocols.

53:17.333 --> 53:19.416
- I'll be working from my room.
- Yes, sir.

53:19.416 --> 53:20.416
Goodnight, sir.

53:37.083 --> 53:38.500
You're wearing a mute mask.

53:39.208 --> 53:40.375
Help! Get in here!

53:40.375 --> 53:44.041
Scream, shout. It won't matter.

53:44.916 --> 53:46.958
It controls the decibel level
of your voice.

53:55.875 --> 53:59.875
Stoica didn't have the file.
Nor did I betray my country.

54:03.041 --> 54:04.083
What do you call this?

54:05.000 --> 54:09.041
Last resort. Somebody kidnapped
my husband to get it.

54:09.041 --> 54:12.958
If that's true, then I'm telling you
we can handle this together.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.958
There's more than one life
at stake here.

54:14.958 --> 54:17.625
No one knows what's at stake here
more than I do.

54:17.625 --> 54:19.166
I don't think you do.

54:19.791 --> 54:22.791
You turn over that file,
you're both dead. I promise you.

54:25.583 --> 54:28.750
You have the file
and you're gonna give it to me.

54:28.750 --> 54:33.208
I get my husband back.
You get your little file back.

54:37.708 --> 54:38.708
Password?

54:38.708 --> 54:43.500
Agent Graves,
keep your emotions in check.

54:43.500 --> 54:48.666
Use your goddamn head.
I'm giving you one chance to walk away.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.125
I assume you've heard
of the Wintertide programme.

54:57.125 --> 54:59.125
The PSYOP stress test.
What about it?

54:59.125 --> 55:03.125
I survived it.
You want to know what they found?

55:04.208 --> 55:05.916
That you're a crazy bitch?

55:08.083 --> 55:10.750
We're not really using that word
to describe women anymore,

55:11.625 --> 55:14.250
especially in the workplace.
There's been a whole thing.

55:15.125 --> 55:20.250
What they found is that I have
an extremely high tolerance for pain.

55:20.875 --> 55:25.666
Are you willing to find out how much pain
you can take, Deputy Director Evans?

55:25.666 --> 55:29.708
I'm your goddamn superior.
How dare you threaten me?

55:29.708 --> 55:33.250
I appreciate the bravado
as much as the next girl.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.500
I will hunt you
to the ends of the earth for this.

55:36.166 --> 55:38.416
I'm having kind of a shitty day, sir,

55:38.416 --> 55:42.958
so I'm really gonna need the next words
out of your mouth to be,

55:42.958 --> 55:45.375
"My password is..."

55:45.375 --> 55:47.833
I, Nathan Evans,
do solemnly swear to support,

55:47.833 --> 55:50.416
defend the Constitution
of the United States

55:50.416 --> 55:53.500
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

55:56.583 --> 55:59.083
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:00.333 --> 56:01.458
Password?

56:03.833 --> 56:05.291
Victory, Maker, Charlie,

56:08.333 --> 56:09.958
3-0-9-1.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.041
God!

56:23.041 --> 56:26.791
Keep this up, I'm gonna move on
to something you're really gonna hate.

56:29.166 --> 56:33.833
Archer, Dexter, Travis, 2-2-3-8.

56:37.916 --> 56:40.375
Like I said,
foreign and domestic.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.750
Now you're just pissing me off, sir.

56:49.416 --> 56:51.250
This is a remote detonator.

56:51.250 --> 56:54.291
I'm gonna ask you one more time
for your password.

56:55.916 --> 56:59.375
If you lie to me again, I'm going to
blow your fucking head off.

57:02.875 --> 57:07.125
Canary Black is Armageddon.
You'll destroy the world as we know it.

57:09.166 --> 57:10.125
Password?

57:11.541 --> 57:14.583
Bravo, Delta, Zulu, 5-7-2-3.

57:14.583 --> 57:19.125
It won't do you any good. You can
only access the file on a secure server.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.666
You're a smart one.

57:43.958 --> 57:46.291
- Hello?
- Sorina, I have one more job for you.

57:46.750 --> 57:49.666
<i>I need you to find the nearest
secure server with CIA access.</i>

57:50.708 --> 57:52.000
This is the last time.

57:57.833 --> 57:58.750
Jarvis speaking.

57:59.458 --> 58:01.916
Jarvis, I need your help.
This is gonna put you in a bad spot.

58:03.583 --> 58:09.083
That's gonna be tricky.
The anvil's dropping. About earlier...

58:09.625 --> 58:11.958
I need the blueprints
for PLK Technologies.

58:11.958 --> 58:13.833
The defence contractor.

58:13.833 --> 58:16.291
They have a military contract
with the DOD.

58:16.291 --> 58:18.958
It means they have a secure server
to send top secret material.

58:18.958 --> 58:22.583
You realise what you're asking?
They'll trace it back to me immediately.

58:22.583 --> 58:25.750
- It's treason.
- You're the only one I can ask.

58:25.750 --> 58:27.333
I'll see what I can do.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.750
<i>This could be Kali.</i>

58:28.750 --> 58:33.833
Yep. Yep. That's the deal. Payment
for any intel leading to her capture.

58:33.833 --> 58:37.000
You've always believed in me.
Believe in me now.

58:54.875 --> 58:57.458
Hey. Thanks for showing up.

58:57.458 --> 59:00.958
Like I had a choice.
Let's just get this over with.

59:00.958 --> 59:03.333
What's the plan?
Go in and shoot up the place.

59:03.333 --> 59:06.208
Not if I can help it.
Ten minutes. In and out.

59:08.541 --> 59:11.625
The drone is a prototype.
Autonomy sucks. Still has some glitches.

59:11.625 --> 59:14.083
I'll bring it back.
Just give me a warning.

59:14.083 --> 59:16.625
Are you trying to steal industrial secrets
or something?

59:17.333 --> 59:19.166
I left my purse inside.

59:21.666 --> 59:24.291
Lock decoder. Earpiece.

59:27.208 --> 59:28.791
- Are you ready?
- One minute.

59:31.458 --> 59:34.458
Come on, Jarvis. Come through.

59:45.750 --> 59:47.666
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.333
- Com check.
- Loud and clear. Take me up.

01:00:16.916 --> 01:00:19.666
- You hanging in there?
- Save the jokes.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.291
<i>Come and get me in ten.</i>

01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:13.500
Come on, come on, come on.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:28.583
Shit. Oh, shit.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.458
Oh, Christ. Help!

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.208
Somebody get in here now!

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:38.583
I don't know why he's not answering, sir.
I'm almost at his room. Did he leave?

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:41.083
No, ma'am.

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:43.250
Open the door.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.958
-  Hey!
- Director Evans!

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:47.833
Get the mask. Get the mask.

01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:51.666
- Get this bomb off of me!
-  Fuck.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:56.291
Your badge was just used to access
a secure server at PLK Technologies, sir.

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.166
It's Agent Graves!
She's stealing Canary Black.

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:01.291
Kill access to the server. Inform PLK
Technologies they've been breached.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.166
Server room breach. Lock it down.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:20.875
Change of plan.
Get that drone in the air, now.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:23.583
Uh, okay.
Just... Just give me a second.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:34.875
It's a big building.
Where am I going?

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:36.541
<i>I need that drone on the 34th floor.</i>

01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:37.708
Eastside hallway window.

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.541
Freeze! Don't move!

01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:42.166
I need that drone, now!

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.625
Shit.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.208
Shit.

01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:18.166
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.083
Avery!

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.500
Avery, are you alive?

01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:42.583
Uh... barely.

01:04:52.666 --> 01:04:56.000
Sorina, meet me where we first met.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.083
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'll be there.

01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.375
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- No.

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:04.916
Wait, hey! My car!
Hey, come back here!

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:07.833
Stop, you crazy bitch!

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:11.750
Oh, my God. I'm so fired.

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:17.083
She broke two of my fingers,
strapped a fucking bomb to my neck.

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:19.333
I want her dead.
No, I'm coming to you.

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:24.250
Our girl just broke into secured facility.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.125
I want everyone and everything
in their places standing by.

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:35.875
You're crazy.
You know that, right?

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.833
Get your laptop.
I need to know what's on this.

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.250
Hurry. I'm running out of time.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:44.458
Do you know how much that drone cost?
I'm so fucked.

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:55.208
Holy shit.

01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.000
That's not a blackmail list.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.375
It's a virus. It looks like it corrupts
and encrypts all internet traffic,

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:08.916
locks down all the devices connected to it
and the result will be full system crash.

01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:13.083
No e-mail, credit cards, communication,
military satellites.

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:15.250
It's a doomsday virus.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.083
Is it targeted?

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:20.125
Yeah. One for each country.

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:23.041
It uses country code
top level domain targeting,

01:06:23.041 --> 01:06:27.750
ISP and IP geotargeting
and geofencing.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.000
So could you target a specific country
without it affecting your own?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.750
Looks that way.
But to use that option...

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.208
Would stop the world from spinning.

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:42.458
Can you encrypt it for me?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.541
The people who want this, they'll use it.
I need to be sure they can't.

01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:50.125
I can't guarantee that.

01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.833
Time's up.

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:58.833
- Come on.
- A programme like this, if it's launched,

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.375
there is no way to undo it.

01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:03.375
Forget you saw this.

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:08.083
What the fuck?!
My drone and my laptop?!

01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:09.916
I need your phone.

01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:12.166
This doesn't sound like Kali's MO.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:56.041
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:15.000
-  Are you okay?
- No. Sorry.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.125
I'm sorry.

01:08:31.333 --> 01:08:32.958
I'm here.

01:08:38.958 --> 01:08:40.583
I'm here.

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:49.625
Come on. Please, please, please.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:54.583
I'm here. Please call. Please, please.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.875
I want every agent, private contractor
and informant on the case.

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:17.666
- Tear this city apart and find her.
- We're working on it, sir.

01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:21.166
SIGINT is scraping all mobile
and electronic traffic in the city,

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:23.916
and we're running facial recognition
profiles with CCTV.

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:26.750
Why don't we know
who she's working for, huh?

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.750
Pull up a list of all foreign operatives
in the country.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:33.291
Her investigations for the last year
are all about Kali. Right?

01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.666
Is that who she's working for?

01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:37.041
There's nothing to suggest that, sir.

01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:39.166
Sir, it's the director.

01:09:41.833 --> 01:09:46.666
Sir. No, sir. We are...
That is correct, sir.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.875
-  Ready?
-  Yes, sir.

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:51.833
I've decrypted
the Canary Black files

01:09:51.833 --> 01:09:54.000
and pre-loaded
the requested country file.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:09.375
Let's go live.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.916
As the world becomes more connected
through technology,

01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:19.541
so too comes our need to work together.

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:23.375
Our shared enemies are becoming
increasingly sophisticated

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:27.458
and have a deep understanding
of the blind spots of global policing.

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:32.375
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:35.083
<i>I'm here to ask you
a very simple question.</i>

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.083
<i>Do you want your country to survive?</i>

01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.875
You need to see this.
There's a potential threat.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:41.791
<i>We live in a world
where bullies thrive...</i>

01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:44.750
<i>The weak kneel to survive.</i>

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:49.000
<i>But tonight, you are all equal
and must kneel together.</i>

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:55.291
<i>Care of the United States government,
I have in my possession Canary Black.</i>

01:10:55.291 --> 01:11:00.583
<i>It's a geo-targeted computer virus
that will end internet use as you know it.</i>

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:02.041
We had nothing to do with this.

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:04.750
<i>There's a file
for each and every one of you.</i>

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:08.541
<i>Stock markets will crash.
Government institutions will freeze.</i>

01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.458
<i>Chaos will be inevitable.</i>

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:15.333
<i>The ransom for saving your country
is 1% of your nation's GDP.</i>

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:20.166
<i>The cost of non-compliance,
however, will be far more expensive.</i>

01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:23.541
As an example of my determination,

01:11:24.583 --> 01:11:28.833
please direct your attention
to the country of... Singapore.

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:46.666
You have each been sent an account
in which to pay the required amount.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:52.916
This is non-negotiable.
You have one hour to comply.

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.375
The entire world will be hunting us.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:05.333
Can they really pay in an hour?

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:09.333
The more time
we give them, the more exposed we are.

01:12:10.416 --> 01:12:12.333
Prepare to steal a trillion dollars.

01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:15.833
Pull up the Singapore satellite feeds
and country analytics.

01:12:21.541 --> 01:12:23.333
What's going on?

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:26.083
They just unleashed Canary Black
on Singapore.

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:30.666
If someone doesn't pay, the world
stops turning or he starts World War III.

01:12:30.666 --> 01:12:33.541
That's one hell of a blackmail file.

01:12:34.916 --> 01:12:36.333
It's more than that.

01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:41.583
We built Canary Black
as a pre-emptive first strike weapon

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:43.791
to counter the increasing threat
of cyber warfare.

01:12:43.791 --> 01:12:46.916
It's a digital nuke
in the cyber arms race.

01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:50.916
It's the highest level of clearance.

01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:53.041
Even the president
doesn't know about it.

01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:57.041
We also built a US file inside it,

01:12:57.916 --> 01:13:00.541
in case of a civil war,
a coup or an invasion.

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:03.500
There is no workaround,
you understand?

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.791
We need to find out where the hell
this broadcast is coming from.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.041
Where's Station Chief Hedlund?

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:47.958
<i>♪ Her eyes, there was her eyes
Her eyes, her whole heart...</i>

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.208
Drop your gun... slowly.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.666
We have a tourist.

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:44.875
Station Chief Hedlund.

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.416
This is an unpleasant surprise.

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:52.541
Breznov. You're behind this.

01:14:52.541 --> 01:14:54.750
- Is he alone?
- Yes.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.208
Where's Avery? Is she alive?

01:14:58.208 --> 01:15:00.750
If you're alone,
that means you're helping her,

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:02.250
which means CIA is not aware.

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:05.375
- Is she alive?!
- You should know better, Hedlund.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.750
Don't get attached
to people you can't save.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.166
The agency will hunt you to the grave.

01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:12.541
You've grown old, my friend.

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:16.083
You're stuck in the Cold War,
while I'm fighting a digital one.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:21.333
Cold War. Digital war.
Only the assholes change.

01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.000
Kill his phone and dump his body.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.958
Consider me impressed, Avery Graves.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:42.208
Breznov.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:46.000
I have Canary Black, and now the world
will pay for your weakness.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.125
You've made me a very rich man.

01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:51.708
You're a bleeding-heart nationalist.
This can't just be about money.

01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:54.958
And you are an arrogant American
with a saviour complex.

01:15:56.625 --> 01:15:59.500
The reign of the global superpower
is over.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.166
You all treat the rest of the world
like servants. But for no longer.

01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:08.750
If you release those files,
millions of people will die.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:14.000
Collateral casualties
in a war without bullets.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.708
You're blaming the wrong person, Avery.

01:16:16.708 --> 01:16:21.916
It is the United States who built Canary
Black to be used one day, and it pays.

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:23.791
No, no, it doesn't have to be.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.208
Let me see David. We had a deal.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:30.791
I consider myself a man of my word.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.625
How did you find me?

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.958
By looking in the gutter.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.875
My father was a patriot.

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:46.166
He used this space to interrogate men
sent to kill him.

01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:50.416
This has always been a place
where tyrants come to die.

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:55.500
David.

01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:00.958
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:06.708
No! You don't need him.
We had an agreement.

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:09.250
- We had an ultimatum.
- Fuck you!

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.458
Make it last.

01:17:13.416 --> 01:17:15.125
Shit...

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.000
You have a lot to talk about.

01:17:20.541 --> 01:17:23.291
Your programme is taking us all
to the brink of collapse.

01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:25.291
This is not our programme.

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:29.250
It's an act of sabotage
against my country.

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:31.166
It's an extinction-level event

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:33.791
for our economy.
What do we do?

01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:39.666
They should pay for everyone's ransom.

01:17:39.666 --> 01:17:41.000
...wants an answer.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.708
South Korea paid 10.7 billion dollars.

01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:51.500
10.4 billion dollars from Mexico.
China, too, 180 billion!

01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:54.583
I want total silence!

01:17:58.375 --> 01:18:00.291
Mr President.

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:01.750
I'm working on it.

01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:04.666
Yes, sir. In light of the danger
I have to recommend again that we pay.

01:18:04.666 --> 01:18:07.166
It'll buy us time
to figure out who's behind this.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.625
Mr President.

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:24.541
This is for Rurik.

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:09.750
David Brooks doesn't know
how to do that.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:18.541
I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

01:19:18.541 --> 01:19:20.166
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:23.833
Your husband.

01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:27.250
Tell me the truth or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you myself.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:32.875
Breznov knows about Canary Black
because I told him.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.916
It was the only leverage I had.

01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:40.375
My source said that
Stoica still had the file on him.

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:46.125
We had to make you believe that
I'd been kidnapped so you'd go and get it.

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:48.916
This isn't answering
any of my questions.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:52.416
I botched a job for the Russian mob.

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:57.500
They saddled me with a $20 million debt
and snitched my identity to Breznov.

01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:03.125
But the plan went to shite
because there was no file

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.958
and Breznov said he would kill you.

01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:09.916
You're Kali.

01:20:16.166 --> 01:20:17.375
No, then...

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:22.458
Jesus Christ.
So everything is a lie.

01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:26.541
No. No. Not our marriage.

01:20:26.541 --> 01:20:30.541
Our whole life together was totally real.

01:20:32.458 --> 01:20:34.833
I'm sorry. I was trying to protect us.

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:38.583
I will deal with Breznov
and I will make this right, I promise.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:43.000
Fuck you. Find a way to cut their internet
feed. I'm gonna stop Breznov.

01:20:44.291 --> 01:20:48.375
My Treasury Department made a transfer.
Brazil and Sweden have paid as well.

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:50.875
Same with Italy, Egypt and Greece.

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:52.541
We have no choice.

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:57.875
We have to transfer the money.

01:20:58.416 --> 01:21:03.833
Otherwise, we might not have
a working country in eight minutes!

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:08.083
We can't allow you
to be known as the president

01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:11.625
that destroyed his country.

01:21:12.458 --> 01:21:13.750
Pay it.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:16.333
No matter what happens,

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:18.833
I will not let the US get away with this.

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.875
We must protect
our country at all costs.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:24.458
1.4 billion from Morocco.

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:28.125
Japan is in. 40 billion.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.166
They're ghosting the system.
It could take days to find out

01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.333
- where the source of the feed is.
- You got minutes.

01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:39.208
China and Russia elevated their alert
status. The EU is doing the same.

01:21:39.208 --> 01:21:43.958
Everyone is pointing the finger at us.
Find me Agent Graves! Where's Hedlund?

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:47.333
M.I.A. Phone's off.
We're pinging his cell for a location.

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:49.875
His cell is currently located
in the Gretsch neighbourhood.

01:21:49.875 --> 01:21:51.500
Also, his computer logs show

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.666
he accessed the PLK building blueprints
right before it was broken into.

01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:56.291
This entire station is compromised.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.916
I want a full tactical team
to hit that location, now.

01:21:58.916 --> 01:22:01.208
- Let's move.
- Should we inform Breznov?

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.208
Let's contain this ourselves.

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:54.250
We're at 940 billion.
The EU. The US.

01:22:55.583 --> 01:22:57.125
They all paid.

01:22:57.875 --> 01:23:01.333
Ready the files for China, Russia,
Germany, France, the UK

01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:03.583
and the United States of America.

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.666
It's time to level the playing field.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.500
- What the hell is going on?
-  It must be overloaded.

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.625
Check the breaker.

01:23:33.416 --> 01:23:35.041
Come on, hurry.

01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:36.500
Make it operational. Quick.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.833
Guys, flip the breaker switches!

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:42.666
Has the breaker tripped?

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.583
We need to make sure
the lines are connected.

01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:02.625
How long until it's operational again?

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:03.916
I don't know yet.

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:06.666
- We need to turn on the backup batteries.
-  I'm on it.

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:08.958
What's taking so long? Hurry up.

01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:11.125
How long will this take...? Hurry.

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.291
You go that way.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.291
-  How much longer?
-  Ten seconds.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:37.333
Seal this room.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.750
Launch the files!

01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:58.458
- Launch the files!
- I can't! The routers are down!

01:24:58.458 --> 01:25:01.708
- We need to get upstairs!
- Grab the laptop, move it!

01:25:02.916 --> 01:25:04.916
Somebody kill her!

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:09.541
Go!

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:20.291
Come on!

01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:35.041
Go, go, go!

01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:54.833
I'll cover you. I'll sweep the area.

01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:28.666
Come on, come on.

01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:32.500
Open the door, hurry!

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.041
Move, move, move.

01:26:34.708 --> 01:26:36.666
Come on, come on!

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:07.416
Go! Go!

01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:17.541
Get online.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:30.708
Help me! Breznov!

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.666
Breznov. Please.

01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:39.833
Get to that
computer or I'll shoot you myself.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:46.916
I don't suppose I can bribe you
with billions of dollars.

01:27:48.916 --> 01:27:51.583
You're the only woman in this world
who would turn down that money.

01:27:52.666 --> 01:27:55.416
You're putting up a better fight
than your husband ever did.

01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:21.083
You fucking bitch.

01:29:22.166 --> 01:29:24.541
Will you fucking die?!

01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:26.666
Not my fucking time.

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:07.250
Honey...

01:30:09.333 --> 01:30:10.791
Avery...

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.916
Are you okay?

01:30:14.916 --> 01:30:16.708
I'll live.

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.833
So... where do we even start?

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:25.958
Listen, if I could go back
and undo everything I would,

01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:28.625
except loving you and you letting me.

01:30:28.625 --> 01:30:33.916
We can start over. On our own terms,
with no secrets, no lies.

01:30:33.916 --> 01:30:37.000
We can fix this.
We have each other, just like always.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.666
Do we? I'm not so sure.
I loved you, David.

01:30:49.833 --> 01:30:51.458
Go, go, go!

01:30:55.375 --> 01:30:56.958
What are you...? No.

01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:59.541
-  Some things are beyond fixing.
-  No.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:01.458
This is one of them.

01:31:10.333 --> 01:31:11.791
We can get through this.

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:15.875
Just give me one more chance.

01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:19.125
Avery.

01:31:20.333 --> 01:31:22.916
We don't get a happy ever after, David.

01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:29.041
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:31.166
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

01:31:34.125 --> 01:31:36.750
-  Stay down on your knees.
-  Drop your weapons!

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.000
-  Stay where you are.
-  Don't move!

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.416
I love you.

01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:43.333
- David!
-  Stay down!

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:45.958
Don't move!

01:31:55.041 --> 01:31:58.166
-  Hands, hands!
-  Stay down!

01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:15.083
You know what this is?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Every oath of allegiance you broke.

01:32:19.791 --> 01:32:22.958
The estimated damages caused,
the crimes you committed.

01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:25.375
You got your co-conspirator
mentor killed,

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:28.000
your co-conspirator husband killed.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.375
You took the entire world
to the brink of war.

01:32:31.375 --> 01:32:34.541
A bad luck charm for anyone
that crosses your path.

01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:37.000
And when we dredge up
your husband's body,

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:41.000
he'll be buried in a landfill
like the trash he is.

01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:45.750
You... have no country.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:48.916
You have no rights.

01:32:50.041 --> 01:32:52.250
You do not exist anymore.

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:57.375
I own you. And for the rest
of your miserable life,

01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:01.583
I'm gonna make sure
you remember that. But first...

01:33:03.541 --> 01:33:05.041
I'm gonna return the favour.

01:33:07.083 --> 01:33:09.291
God... Goddamn it.

01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:21.041
Seems you require medical attention.
That will be all, Deputy Director Evans.

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.333
Who the hell are you?

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:26.833
You should be receiving a call
right about now

01:33:26.833 --> 01:33:31.166
that will explain the situation.
Do close the door on your way out.

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:41.041
Mr President? Yes, sir.

01:33:43.083 --> 01:33:45.958
Quite the tempest you've stirred,
Mrs Graves.

01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:47.333
Who are you?

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:49.416
My friends call me Elizabeth.

01:33:51.208 --> 01:33:54.708
I'd like to offer you a job.
You've proven your skills to be exemplary.

01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:59.000
And I hire only the best.
I'd like you to join MC6.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.458
I don't know what that is.

01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:02.833
Well, that's because until tonight,
we didn't exist.

01:34:04.291 --> 01:34:06.625
I suppose I should thank you for that.

01:34:06.625 --> 01:34:09.416
We're tasked with handling
only the most critical missions

01:34:09.416 --> 01:34:12.000
on the highest scale of the threat alert

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.958
beyond the capabilities
of the other agencies.

01:34:14.958 --> 01:34:18.375
Now, I can make all of this
unpleasantness disappear.

01:34:18.375 --> 01:34:21.333
Unless, of course, you'd like to rot
in prison for the rest of your life.

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:27.291
That's assuming they can contain me.

01:34:32.041 --> 01:34:33.750
Is that a yes?

01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:39.208
We could use you.

01:34:43.541 --> 01:34:45.416
The world needs saving.
