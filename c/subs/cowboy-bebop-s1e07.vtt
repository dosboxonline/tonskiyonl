WEBVTT

00:06.756 --> 00:08.925
[rock 'n' roll music playing]

00:21.021 --> 00:22.564
[Faye] You ever double dinner?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.566
Does it involve two dinners?

00:25.275 --> 00:26.443
Or three.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.195
[Spike] Sounds like
one too many dinner guests to me.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.198
[Faye] Life's short.
Why not have a dinner party?

00:32.282 --> 00:33.658
[Spike] I'm but a simple man.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.618
With simple tastes.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.578
[groans]

00:38.371 --> 00:39.789
Still with the migraines?

00:39.873 --> 00:40.874
[shushes]

00:42.333 --> 00:43.668
Eight days and counting.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.755
My head feels like
an Astral Gate explosion.

00:47.797 --> 00:48.840
You know what you need?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.425
[Spike] Less noise?

00:51.676 --> 00:53.636
The big "O."

00:53.720 --> 00:56.473
Nature's cure. I speak from experience.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.433
Recent experience.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.269
And the experts agree.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.273
-Yeah, looks scientific.
-[Faye] Mmm.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.442
You know what I've come to realize

01:07.525 --> 01:09.444
flipping through
all of this fine literature?

01:10.361 --> 01:11.654
Don't care.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.366
I've been spending
way too much time limiting myself.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.534
Life's a buffet.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.661
I thought it was a dinner party.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.414
Yeah, whatever it is, I'm ready to eat.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
Listen, not to upend your, uh…

01:24.709 --> 01:25.585
Your journey.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.506
But, uh, you know
that's not real, right? It's fantasy.

01:29.589 --> 01:35.178
What I can't tell is real is
whether or not I'm into butts or boobs.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.556
I like bubble butts. Hmm…

01:38.640 --> 01:41.976
Bubble butts are nice,
but not as nice as these little rascals.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.437
-[grunts]
-Yeah, yeah, I'm a boob gal, for sure.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.607
-[grunts]
-And what's this position? Blorking?

01:47.690 --> 01:48.525
Yuck!

01:48.608 --> 01:51.319
-[Spike] I'm going back to bed.
-[Faye] Sleep tight!

01:51.402 --> 01:54.197
I'll be reading up
on pontooning and zero grav.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.407
Ooh, I want to pontoon.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.619
Uh, excuse me.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.456
Hello, darlin'.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.417
Miss me?

02:06.960 --> 02:07.794
[grunts]

02:07.877 --> 02:09.045
[laughs]

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
Okay. [sniffles]

02:12.340 --> 02:13.716
You get that one for free.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.888
You've got some brass ovaries
coming in here after everything you did!

02:18.972 --> 02:19.806
I need a lift.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.266
Really? What?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.517
Off planet.

02:23.101 --> 02:27.564
You… [laughs] You want me to be
your interstellar taxi service now?

02:27.647 --> 02:31.151
In exchange for your Identikit?
Absolutely.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.279
Don't even try to pretend
that you don't want it.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.534
-Where?
-Santo City.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.704
In a hurry. I need my go-bag
with extreme prejudice.

02:42.787 --> 02:47.000
Oh. What did you do?
Pretend to be someone else's mother?

02:47.959 --> 02:51.754
Believe it or not, my world doesn't
revolve around my freeze-dried progeny.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.257
But if you help me get to Santo,

02:55.091 --> 02:57.552
you just might find out
what happened to your real parents.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.766
You should know
I've been crewing with cowboys,

03:03.850 --> 03:07.937
and last I remember,
there's a fat-ass bounty on your head.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.564
It is quite a lot.

03:10.565 --> 03:15.153
But why would your cowboy friends even
think to look up your dear old mother?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.655
So you want me to lie to them?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.075
Not lie. Never!

03:23.620 --> 03:26.873
Tell stories. Nice stories.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.710
[sighs]

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
[theme music playing]

05:08.808 --> 05:11.185
Really? You're Faye's mom?

05:11.269 --> 05:13.604
[Faye] Yeah, so she claims. [laughs]

05:13.688 --> 05:16.482
I always thought you were
hatched in a madman's lab.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.443
[Whitney] She is something else,
isn't she?

05:18.943 --> 05:23.156
Aw. I've been so worried about
my baby running around with a gun.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.491
Thank God she has you two for backup.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.952
Backup, huh? [chuckles]

05:29.495 --> 05:30.538
Migraine?

05:30.621 --> 05:31.622
[Spike] Yeah.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.297
What's that? What's…

05:39.380 --> 05:40.715
-[bone cracks]
-Oh!

05:42.550 --> 05:43.551
[groans in relief]

05:46.054 --> 05:47.430
Son of a mother.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.351
-How did you…
-[Whitney] Oh, your posture.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.854
I could tell you had a kink in your neck
and neck pain can lead to migraines.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.359
I used to be a masseuse.
For a Dionysian sulfur spa on Tharsis.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.070
-I think I love you, Miss, uh…
-Whitney.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.905
Whitney. Enchanté.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.784
[Faye clears throat]

06:08.910 --> 06:11.996
Hey, so my mom was wondering
if we could give her a ride to Santo City.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.041
Ah, no can do. Ship's grounded
until after Kimmie's recital.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.542
[Whitney] You have a child?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.379
-How old?
-She just turned eight.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.174
Oh, children are such a gift
and so sweet at that age.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.217
Enjoy it.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.304
Because when the hormones hit,
everything changes.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
[all laughing]

06:35.311 --> 06:36.896
Jet, you know, if we leave now,

06:36.979 --> 06:39.440
we can get to Santo City
in plenty of time for the recital.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.150
No, Faye, it's fine.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.361
I can't ask a father
to miss his daughter's recital

06:43.444 --> 06:46.572
just to help me
with my personal problems. I'll survive.

06:47.865 --> 06:48.783
[sighing] Hopefully.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.369
[Spike] Well, that…

06:52.870 --> 06:54.080
That begs a follow-up.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.290
You see,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.376
I'm on the lam…

07:00.711 --> 07:01.796
from my husband.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.005
[Jet] Faye's dad?

07:03.089 --> 07:06.717
No, he was many husbands ago,
God rest his soul.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.971
I make beautiful babies,
but my taste in men,

07:10.471 --> 07:11.931
[scoffs] not so much.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.144
This one is a womanizer
and degenerate gambler.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.814
He basically turned my life
into a bad country song.

07:19.897 --> 07:20.982
Broken heart,

07:22.024 --> 07:23.234
pocket full of bills.

07:25.736 --> 07:29.323
And, uh, he was just awful to Faye.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.159
Isn't that right, honey?

07:31.868 --> 07:34.954
Oh, yeah.
He made lots of creepy eyes at me.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.626
Jet, Santo does have
the best comms infrastructure of any city.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.589
What? I've got a soft spot for mommies.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.757
You're a sick man, Spike Spiegel.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.552
-Don't be lewd. I'm talking about mothers.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:49.635 --> 07:53.264
Motherhood. It's a lovely calling.
Mommies make the pain go away.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.390
I bet.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.310
[Whitney] Wow. Look at all these peppers.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.104
You know, I have an amazing
roast pepper dumpling recipe.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.608
Got it from a rogue monk
on the far side of Trident.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.777
Faye's favorite growing up.
Isn't that right, darling?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.362
Ah, sure was.

08:08.446 --> 08:12.325
Jet, man, we've got plenty of time
to get to Santo before the recital.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.493
Do it for Faye.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.415
Fine, forget Faye.
Do it for the dumplings.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.583
All right.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.711
I'll take you to Santo,
but I want that recipe.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.754
With pleasure.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.297
[Jet] Fins up in five.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.216
Get us prepped topside.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.593
[Spike] Dumplings for dinner.

08:34.555 --> 08:35.556
See?

08:36.807 --> 08:39.060
Everybody loves a nice story.

08:39.810 --> 08:40.811
[chuckles]

08:42.396 --> 08:44.398
[slow jazz music playing]

08:50.363 --> 08:51.197
[Ana] A theremin?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.782
[Gren] Look,
before you pass any judgment--

08:52.865 --> 08:55.618
We might as well hire a magician
in a bow tie and coattails

08:55.701 --> 08:57.078
to saw a man in half.

08:57.161 --> 09:00.498
Okay, reading that as a hard no
on the theremin--

09:00.581 --> 09:01.707
[Julia] He's alive?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.461
He's alive and you didn't tell me?

09:06.045 --> 09:06.963
Who's alive?

09:07.046 --> 09:08.923
[laughs bitterly] Don't play coy.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.927
When have you ever been nostalgic?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.016
Okay, um… [clears throat]

09:20.226 --> 09:21.686
I'm gonna give you two a moment.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.985
[door opens]

09:29.068 --> 09:30.486
[Julia exhales heavily]

09:31.988 --> 09:32.905
[door closes]

09:32.989 --> 09:35.533
-How long have you known?
-Not long.

09:38.536 --> 09:42.582
-So he's just out there? In the world?
-As far as I know.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.376
-Where?
-Didn't say.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.589
Just that he works as a cowboy.
Goes by Spike Spiegel.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.300
Did he ask about me?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.303
What do you think?

09:57.263 --> 09:58.556
You should have told me.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.350
I could have gone to him.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.643
To what end?

10:03.519 --> 10:06.105
Weren't you the one telling me,
in this very office,

10:06.188 --> 10:07.565
that I should leave Vicious?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.482
Not like this.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.900
That I had a choice?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.153
Vicious knows Spike is alive.

10:12.236 --> 10:16.324
And he is not gonna stop hunting him
until one of the two of them is dead.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.787
If you run to him, you're gonna
spend the rest of your life running,

10:21.871 --> 10:25.458
looking over your shoulder,
wondering when Vicious' blade will come.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.545
Who's to say that won't happen if I stay?

10:33.090 --> 10:33.924
[sighs]

10:45.144 --> 10:47.313
[both laughing] Whoa!

10:47.396 --> 10:48.230
Yeah.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.024
[Whitney] Make sure you have
a super hot wok

10:50.107 --> 10:51.776
with just a dash of fish oil.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.487
Be careful not to overcook. And the key…

10:55.404 --> 10:57.990
The key is to caramelize the peppers.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.950
-A woman after my own heart.
-Please.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.869
-Smells amazing.
-[Spike] Yeah.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.330
-[Jet] Is that ginger?
-[Spike] Let me have a taste.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.085
Oh…

11:09.168 --> 11:10.169
Oh.

11:10.252 --> 11:13.422
-Oh, like heaven in the mouth, isn't it?
-[Jet] God, let me have more of that.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.634
Pretty cheap definition of heaven,
if you ask me.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.760
[Jet] Mmm.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.888
Faye, darling. Um…

11:21.639 --> 11:28.270
Let's see if we can find
that last secret ingredient.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.355
Sure, Mother.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.733
[Jet] You can really taste the ginger.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.151
[Spike] I know. It's spicy.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.613
Do you want your Identikit or not?

11:38.239 --> 11:42.326
Do you even still have it?
I haven't seen you in years.

11:42.410 --> 11:46.080
You know, it's starting to feel
like the con all over again.

11:47.123 --> 11:51.419
[Jet] Something's off.
Look at Faye's body language.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.545
[Spike] Mmm-hmm.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.339
-You know, arms crossed, defensive.
-[Spike] Right.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.508
-Like she's cornered or something.
-[Spike] Mmm-hmm.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.634
What do you think that's about?

12:00.010 --> 12:03.139
Who understands the vagaries and minutiae
of the mother-daughter relationship?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.056
Not me.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.183
Aw. You're jealous.

12:06.934 --> 12:10.438
The boys adore me, and of course they do.
What's not to adore?

12:11.063 --> 12:14.233
That you're a fucking liar
and I should turn you in.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.362
Try these panties on.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.907
If I'm locked up, you can French kiss

12:21.991 --> 12:25.286
all hopes of ever knowing
your past goodbye.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.746
I don't know.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.290
Do they really look related?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.543
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.044
Fine.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.547
The jig is up.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.552
A twist of lemon is what makes the magic.

12:41.635 --> 12:42.845
[laughs]

12:43.763 --> 12:47.057
So, Whitney, what was Faye like as a kid?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.309
[chuckles]

12:48.893 --> 12:51.395
A delight, and a terror.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.940
She ever tell you
about her, uh, one-woman band?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.984
Her botched quinceañera?

12:57.902 --> 13:01.447
When she auditioned
for the Miss Ganymede pageant?

13:01.530 --> 13:04.158
What? You never told me
you were from Ganymede.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.578
I'm a Salter. Ha!

13:08.287 --> 13:09.371
-[Jet chuckles]
-Oh.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.499
I thought you were from Europa.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.293
-No, I moved there for my ex-wife.
-[Faye] Ah.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.586
Where did you go to high school?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.840
-She was homeschooled.
-Explaining much.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.759
[Faye and Whitney chuckle]

13:24.512 --> 13:26.597
And on that note, who wants to eat?

13:27.139 --> 13:27.973
I do!

13:42.780 --> 13:44.114
She's right, you know.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.828
If you go to Fearless,
you'll never be safe.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.915
[whispering] Ana's not
the only one in the building

13:52.998 --> 13:55.584
who listens in
on other people's conversations.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.008
You'll never be safe from Vicious.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.305
At least, not while he's still alive.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.878
[Spike] You could just let it go.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.797
There is bliss in ignorance.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.968
[Jet] Yeah. I'll be happier once I know.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.012
[scanner beeping]

14:51.307 --> 14:52.391
[beeps]

14:57.730 --> 14:59.899
[laughing]

15:01.108 --> 15:02.443
How happy are you now?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.360
Shit!

15:03.444 --> 15:05.321
That is an impressive rap sheet.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.282
I think I might actually
like her even more.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.159
She's a goddamn con artist.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.913
-Either Faye's getting taken or…
-[Spike] Or she's in on it.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.498
[Faye] Ah, shit.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.507
Here's the thing.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.427
I don't know Whitney. Or…

15:29.386 --> 15:31.055
All right, I do know Whitney but…

15:31.764 --> 15:34.475
She got me out of cryo-sleep
pretending to be my mom.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.102
The whole thing was a scam. I swear.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.146
Jesus, Faye. Can the crap.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.148
I really thought that she was my mom.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.901
Uh, how could you not know?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.236
Because I have amnesia.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.533
It can happen if you've been
in cryo-sleep for too long.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.953
Everything that happened before I woke up,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.664
basically my entire life,
I don't remember.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.874
So you have brain damage?

15:59.541 --> 16:00.626
No!

16:00.709 --> 16:01.919
I mean, yes.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.170
I don't know, dick-wad!

16:03.253 --> 16:06.966
All I know is that when I woke up,
I didn't remember who I was,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.760
where I was from, or why I was there.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.638
I didn't even know my own name.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.724
So that's the scam.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.935
Whitney wakes up amnesiacs,

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
pretends to be their family,
steals their benefits.

16:20.854 --> 16:24.566
Why didn't you tell us? Hmm?
You could've been straight with us.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.860
Whitney has my Identikit.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.904
The stuff inside it
should tell me who I am.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.572
So blackmail.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.409
Even more reason
why you should have said something.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.576
We would've had your back.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.787
I know. I…

16:38.122 --> 16:40.791
[hesitates] I don't know, just…
She just needed a ride. So I--

16:40.874 --> 16:41.834
[Jet] You lied!

16:41.917 --> 16:45.754
I brought you on
my goddamn ship, in my home,

16:47.214 --> 16:48.132
and you played me.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.262
I always did have my suspicions.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.638
-Spike!
-Okay.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.348
[Faye sighs]

16:56.432 --> 16:59.810
I'm… I'm sorry. I fucked up.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.395
[comms crackling]

17:01.478 --> 17:08.152
[man] Dobre dien, I believe you have
one of mine aboard your ship.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.903
What the hell?

17:09.987 --> 17:11.989
They're pirate broadcasting
on our systems.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.449
[man over comms] It's fact.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.910
Your security

17:17.703 --> 17:21.832
is, unfortunately for you,

17:22.916 --> 17:24.293
quite garbage.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.753
Holy shit.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.088
It's the Mink.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.091
The Iron Mink.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.968
Who the hell?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.679
The most notorious arms dealer
in the solar system.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.805
-Shit.
-Oh, shit.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.392
It's also fact, you have…

17:40.476 --> 17:41.393
[exhales heavily]

17:42.770 --> 17:45.689
one hour to hand her over.

17:47.149 --> 17:51.236
Or I will explode you and your ship.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.362
-Wait, Mr. Mink.
-What?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.322
You?

17:53.405 --> 17:54.782
You've got the wrong ship.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.034
All right?
We're just cowboys looking for a bounty.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.494
[Whitney] Well, shit.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.290
[Mink] Hello,

18:04.875 --> 18:06.502
lyubov moya.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.589
Did you truly believe
you could run from me?

18:10.672 --> 18:11.840
Do you know this guy?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.342
Minkie.

18:18.806 --> 18:23.227
I thought I very clearly
told you to fuck off.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.436
[sighs]

18:24.520 --> 18:27.523
Yes, was most clear.

18:28.565 --> 18:35.114
And the only reason you aren't sucking
stardust in icy vacuum of space

18:36.281 --> 18:39.034
is because of vows I made.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.578
-Vows?
-He's your husband?

18:41.662 --> 18:42.621
You guys are married?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.331
[Whitney] Allow me to handle this.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.171
You want me,
you must go through my friends first.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.506
-[Jet] The hell he does!
-[Faye] Fuck that.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.715
-[Spike] What?
-[Faye] No.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.342
You

18:56.718 --> 18:58.345
are disgusting.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.181
Shameless.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.600
Ravishing.

19:04.935 --> 19:05.936
Miserable.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.438
Husk. Blyat.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.568
I loved you so much.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.989
It makes me sad to kill you.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.074
[Faye] Ah, shit!

19:20.033 --> 19:21.785
-What are you doing?
-I'll fix it later.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.662
We need to
get off this ship in triple-time.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.792
Jet, please.
We can't turn her in until she's--

19:28.876 --> 19:30.669
We? There is no "we" here.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.464
I'm turning her in. You lied and brought
your con mom aboard my ship.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.675
Now the Iron Mink's all over my ass.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.886
In fairness,
it is a little bit of a "we" problem.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.721
All I wanted to do today

19:40.804 --> 19:44.266
is get a decent signal so I don't miss
my daughter's goddamn recital.

19:44.349 --> 19:49.229
Oh. And all I wanted to do was find out
who I am and who my family are.

19:53.859 --> 19:54.818
-[Jet] Give me that.
-[Whitney] Hey!

19:54.902 --> 19:57.362
That is worth more
than you'll make in a lifetime.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.745
Is that a tracker?

20:04.828 --> 20:07.581
No. Uh… Minkie would never.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.375
Our relationship is based on trust.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.627
Said the scorpion.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.086
Where is Faye's Identikit?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.923
Like I'd tell you.
I may be a natural blond, but I'm not an…

20:16.006 --> 20:17.466
[both] Are you fucking kidding me?

20:17.549 --> 20:18.592
…idiot.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.303
There's only one way she gets the kit.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.931
You take these off. I take her there.

20:30.020 --> 20:30.938
Yes.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.691
Go! But you give her what she's after.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.151
Liking this side of you.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.904
Spike and I will take the tracker
and lead the Mink the other way.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.530
Liking this less.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.531
Jet. [sighs]

20:42.783 --> 20:43.742
Thank you.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.870
You, let's go.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.960
-Why you do me like that?
-Come on.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.796
[operatic music playing]

21:00.425 --> 21:01.343
So rare.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.180
The three of us together.

21:06.223 --> 21:10.435
Calls for something just as rare
to mark the occasion.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.941
Earth stock Pinot Noir.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.986
The 67-2 fields.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.864
Aromas of wild berries and dark chocolate.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.533
Hedonistic body,

21:24.616 --> 21:28.662
and a deep finish
with lingering hints of tobacco.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.043
[swirling wine in mouth]

21:39.923 --> 21:41.383
[sighs in pleasure]

21:41.466 --> 21:43.760
Profoundly luxurious mouthfeel.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.852
-Never tasted the like.
-Mmm.

21:56.690 --> 22:00.902
Shall I come back after the mincing
and preening part of the day is over?

22:08.410 --> 22:09.661
[laughing]

22:10.704 --> 22:12.581
Right to business. Very good.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.125
So,

22:16.918 --> 22:18.628
you two are reaching for an overthrow.

22:19.212 --> 22:23.091
Worth an extra 2% to each of you.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.013
Well, I'm a fan of money.

22:29.264 --> 22:32.976
But not of taking risks
that might get us all killed.

22:33.810 --> 22:34.644
What's the play?

22:36.646 --> 22:38.065
Mao will present the Elders

22:38.148 --> 22:41.485
with incontrovertible proof
I'm planning a coup d'état.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.779
A bloody one at that.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.656
[Santiago tutting]

22:49.534 --> 22:50.452
Go on.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.705
The Elders will swear a death note.

22:54.331 --> 23:00.670
You will catch me and deliver me
to the temple in irons.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.008
The only weapon, aside from the Kobun's,
will be my katana,

23:05.092 --> 23:11.890
which Mao will use per tradition
as my accuser to carry out the execution.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.603
And at that moment,

23:18.271 --> 23:19.773
shall I wonder out loud?

23:20.482 --> 23:24.319
You will miraculously shed your shackles.

23:24.986 --> 23:25.987
He shall.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.533
I liberate Mao of my sword,
kill the Kobun and…

23:31.535 --> 23:33.370
take the Elders' heads.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.038
[Santiago] Hmm.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.602
Mmm.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.659
Let's bump it to 3%.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.496
And you can, uh,

24:18.081 --> 24:20.584
swing your sword as you like.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.921
Consider it settled.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.633
Then let us mince…

24:31.303 --> 24:32.804
and preen!

24:37.893 --> 24:39.227
[indistinct chatter]

24:47.444 --> 24:50.697
We're not moving. Why are we not moving?

24:51.239 --> 24:54.034
Accident? Dead goat? No God?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.995
Whatever it is,
we're sitting ducks on this bus.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.248
It seemed like the fastest way
to put distance between us and the docks.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.541
-Yeah? Does this seem fast?
-Yeah.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.834
Does this seem fast to you?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.252
He must really love you.

25:06.087 --> 25:06.922
Oh.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.299
He did good, huh?

25:10.091 --> 25:11.968
I like to think we make each other happy.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.261
[Jet groans]

25:13.845 --> 25:15.055
[phone ringing]

25:16.473 --> 25:18.892
[groans] No, thank you.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.560
-[Spike] Go easy.
-I trusted her.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.021
She knew that and she still lied.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.317
Maybe that's on you and not her.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.237
-We need to move!
-[bell rings]

25:30.320 --> 25:34.616
Call me back. I want to make sure
you vaginas are still alive or whatever.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.869
Wouldn't get my hopes up.
Minkie's relentless.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.498
What were you doing
with those two minor-leaguers anyway?

25:41.581 --> 25:45.377
Uh, my ship went belly up, so I'm stuck
with them until I get a new one.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.714
Desperate times, desperate measures.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.924
[Faye] What are you doing?

25:51.007 --> 25:53.927
-We need wheels to get where we're going.
-It's a dead end.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.178
[woman] You have my ticket.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.931
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
We're running so late. I'm so sorry.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.266
I'm sure you understand.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.850
Garçon, my car please.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.186
-Ticket?
-Of course, I have it, uh…

26:03.937 --> 26:07.023
-Right, I gave it to you, darling heart.
-What? No, you didn't.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.316
She's always losing things.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.069
My fault, I didn't give her
enough structure as a child.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.823
I handed it to you
when I was doing my lipstick. Remember?

26:16.241 --> 26:19.327
Oh, yes! The ticket. Wow, I, um…

26:19.911 --> 26:20.996
I think I lost it.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.873
Oh, my God, I would lose my head
if it wasn't attached!

26:23.957 --> 26:25.917
Sorry, ma'am. No ticket, no car.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.462
Oh, come on, it's over there,
the, um, puny one.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.840
Puny? Mother,
it's all I got in the divorce.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.926
Issues in the bedroom. Nothing
a good safe word wouldn't have fixed.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.219
Jesus Christ, Mother.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.014
And if you'd done your exercises,
like I told you…

26:39.097 --> 26:41.766
I mean, nobody likes parking
a motorcycle in a two-car garage.

26:41.850 --> 26:44.853
Oh, right, and there's nothing wrong
with my garage.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.605
Quite the opposite, actually.
Tight as a drum.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.648
Ladies, please, I need you to move--

26:48.732 --> 26:51.693
Oh, my God. My…
You just touched my mother's boob!

26:51.776 --> 26:54.654
Did you see what he just did?
He just touched my mother's boob!

26:54.738 --> 26:58.033
I demand to see your manager.
You should be arrested for assault.

26:58.116 --> 26:58.950
Wait. I…

26:59.034 --> 27:01.911
You think because you're a Mr. Man,
the gatekeeper of keys,

27:01.995 --> 27:04.581
you can cop a feel as you please
on my poor mother?

27:04.664 --> 27:07.751
I didn't touch… Just…
[sputtering] Which are your keys?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.631
Wait. Okay.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.468
The least you could do
is pull it up for us.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.555
-[Faye] You heard the lady!
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.310
[chuckles]

27:33.360 --> 27:34.611
[Mao] What are you doing here?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.406
How was the meeting?

27:40.950 --> 27:43.870
Did you really think
Vicious came up with this plan?

27:45.330 --> 27:46.956
It's fair to think he didn't.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.168
He's a shoot-first-fuck-the-consequences
type of guy.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.796
You called him a mad dog.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.423
Said he'd get us all killed.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.634
Do you want me to apologize?

27:59.761 --> 28:00.679
No.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.598
I want you to take his head.

28:06.893 --> 28:11.398
You know, marital strife
rarely inspires good decisions.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.900
I know exactly what I'm asking.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.739
He offered you, what? 2%?

28:21.658 --> 28:24.327
I'm offering you the entire throne.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.709
Then what exactly do you get
with this double cross?

28:32.627 --> 28:34.462
A ticket out of the Syndicate.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.264
[Faye grunting]

28:44.347 --> 28:46.933
Goddamn useless piece of shit.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.729
You know, it's adorable

28:51.563 --> 28:55.400
that people still think valet keys
keep people out of their trunks.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.197
Is there anything you can't do?

29:03.950 --> 29:05.076
[Whitney] Change the tire.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.329
Lug nuts and acrylics aren't friends.

29:09.539 --> 29:13.376
Oh. Wouldn't want to break a nail
trying to protect your own hide.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.628
Certainly not! I just had them done.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.422
There you go.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.050
Admit it,

29:22.135 --> 29:23.052
we have fun.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.806
Yeah, when you're not manipulating me
or trying to steal my identity.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.349
Sure, we have a hoot.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.187
You know, I actually see
a lot of myself in you.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.114
-In what way?
-[Whitney sighs]

29:44.240 --> 29:45.283
The best way.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.245
You're clever, tough,
audacious, suffer no fools.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.580
I can think of one I've suffered.

29:50.663 --> 29:53.500
And when life gives you lemons,
you make a vodka twist.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.503
You're a survivor, Faye.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.588
Like moi.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.635
I'm a survivor because of you.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.428
I have to admit,

30:06.429 --> 30:10.308
leaving you was
one of the hardest things I've ever done.

30:12.101 --> 30:15.021
I actually enjoyed being your mother.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.234
Is that why you up and left?
No forwarding address?

30:20.276 --> 30:23.947
That was because of some moderate debt
I had accrued and…

30:24.823 --> 30:27.116
My lenders had gotten impatient.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.743
Oh. Okay.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.330
I didn't plan on leaving when I did, Faye.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.792
I loved our little life together.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.586
I wasn't ready for it to be over.

30:43.842 --> 30:48.179
Well, a fantasy is just a fantasy.
It wasn't real.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.810
You know what the difference
between reality and fantasy is?

30:55.687 --> 30:56.855
Your perception.

30:58.565 --> 31:02.151
Fantasies can be
as real as you want them to be.

31:04.904 --> 31:05.905
[horn honks]

31:06.406 --> 31:09.242
North is that way,
which means that's west.

31:09.325 --> 31:12.370
[Jet] That way's west?
I thought we just came from west.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.913
I'm totally turned around.

31:15.790 --> 31:17.041
-Shit!
-[Spike] What?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.877
Kimmie's recital's about to start.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.756
-I'm gonna take the call in there.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:23.840 --> 31:26.259
-How long's this gonna take?
-As long as it takes.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.261
What do you want me to do about this?

31:28.344 --> 31:29.345
Figure it out, Spike.

31:29.929 --> 31:33.141
You expect me to deal with the world's
most notorious arms dealer alone,

31:33.224 --> 31:34.475
while you watch your daughter's recital?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.810
She's got the lead.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.521
That's fair.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.109
Why is everybody's family problems
my problems?

31:43.985 --> 31:44.861
I'm the orphan.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.294
[whispers] Sorry I'm late.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.964
Nah. Nick of time, pal.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.258
You won't believe the shit
I went through to get here.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.886
-On a job?
-Something like that.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.014
You went with the peonies?

32:13.097 --> 32:17.185
Yeah, it was, uh… It's more wow
for the woo than the lilies, you know?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.603
[chuckles]

32:18.686 --> 32:20.480
-Thanks.
-Yeah, of course.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.858
[whispers] Those are from Jet?

32:24.442 --> 32:25.276
Yeah.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.445
He's trying.

32:53.888 --> 32:57.183
Cripes, you have done
some damage in the world.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.938
[Whitney] Identikits are
in the back right corner.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.944
Faye.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.657
Are you really ready
to find out who you are?

33:13.574 --> 33:14.993
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.539
You'd been on ice for years, Faye.

33:20.748 --> 33:23.334
No one came for you.
You know what that means.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.337
Either your parents are long dead or…

33:27.338 --> 33:28.464
[sighs]

33:28.548 --> 33:29.966
Or they left you for dead.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.014
-[Jet laughing] Wow.
-[audience cheering]

33:37.140 --> 33:38.057
Look at you.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.108
I'm the sun.
The center of our solar system.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.651
Yes, you are, baby.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.487
I'm gonna move up closer
to get better pictures.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.573
[children singing]

33:54.949 --> 33:56.242
[Alisa sighs]

33:59.912 --> 34:03.583
Would you mind, uh,
sending me some of those pics?

34:04.709 --> 34:05.835
'Course.

34:05.918 --> 34:09.088
I'll, um, make sure we get at least one
of Kimmie with the flowers you got her.

34:10.048 --> 34:10.965
Thanks.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.803
It, um… It really means a lot to her
that you're here.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.513
[men grunting in background]

34:17.597 --> 34:19.807
I'd fight the world
to make sure I showed up.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.397
I have money. Disguises.

34:27.356 --> 34:28.191
A ship.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.779
It's a one-seater, but we'll make it work!

34:33.446 --> 34:35.907
Think of the fun we'd have, partnered up.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.409
Living free,
no one telling us what's what.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.124
[sighs]

34:48.669 --> 34:49.670
I have to know.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.225
[chuckling] She gets that from you!

35:02.308 --> 35:04.018
Oh, yeah, she's got my moves.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.269
[laughs]

35:11.901 --> 35:13.236
[grunting in background]

35:37.135 --> 35:38.553
Okay.

35:40.888 --> 35:41.806
X1.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.517
X1.

35:45.351 --> 35:48.062
G, X1, X1…

35:48.146 --> 35:50.523
X1. X1.

35:50.606 --> 35:53.484
X1, X1, X1…

36:19.886 --> 36:20.887
What the…

36:28.895 --> 36:30.104
The fuck are you?

36:31.564 --> 36:33.858
-[audience cheering]
-Yeah! Kimmie!

36:38.404 --> 36:39.739
Oh, man.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.328
[grunting in background]

36:53.169 --> 36:54.378
Need something, fella?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.130
Uh…

36:56.214 --> 36:59.383
No. I'm good. Good as can be, actually.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.427
-[Spike grunts]
-[exclaims]

37:02.803 --> 37:03.721
Oh!

37:03.804 --> 37:05.431
-I've got to go.
-[Alisa] Good seeing you.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.515
Uh, you too.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.194
-Shit. Thanks for this.
-[Spike] Yeah.

37:19.028 --> 37:19.946
Happy to help.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.740
Oh, hey, how was Kimmie?

37:22.823 --> 37:23.991
-Good, really good.
-Yeah?

37:24.075 --> 37:26.577
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's great. That's great.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.413
-[Jet] Did you get 'em all?
-[Spike] Yeah.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.832
[Jet] And the Mink?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.127
Wait. That's not the Mink.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.298
-Where's the Mink?
-I don't know.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.844
-Was that really the only thing in there?
-That was it.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.308
[Mink] Hello, lyubov moya.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.607
Oh, shit.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.193
How did you find me?

37:59.277 --> 38:02.029
You think I put only one tracker on you?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.364
[laughs]

38:03.447 --> 38:05.783
That's right, my pretty zaika.

38:05.866 --> 38:06.993
[sighs]

38:07.076 --> 38:11.330
If only you hadn't stolen so much from me.

38:12.915 --> 38:17.503
There's no stealing in marriage.

38:17.586 --> 38:19.672
What's yours is mine, and what's mine…

38:21.090 --> 38:23.301
I lock away for safekeeping.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.763
Every time you open
your beautiful lying mouth,

38:29.640 --> 38:32.476
I want to kiss it. [growls]

38:35.229 --> 38:37.898
It breaks my heart but I must kill you.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.277
Must? But why?

38:41.360 --> 38:44.447
Word gets out Iron Mink was conned…

38:46.449 --> 38:48.200
I lose face.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.662
Honor! Reputation.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.457
Iron Mink

38:55.583 --> 38:56.959
must be feared.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.045
Dreaded.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.799
Otherwise, he is just Mink.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.595
Now I kill you.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.974
Whoa, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Mr. Mink.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.100
Mr. Mink, please.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.145
Don't kill her. Or me.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.357
I'm… I'm begging you.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.400
And who are you to beg?

39:25.154 --> 39:25.988
Her daughter.

39:29.075 --> 39:29.950
Whitney…

39:30.659 --> 39:34.121
Whitney is a lying, stealing…

39:35.289 --> 39:36.874
It's how she survives,

39:37.458 --> 39:39.752
and I'm sure that
she didn't mean to hurt you.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.004
Or me.

39:43.589 --> 39:46.884
Oh, darling heart,
I wasn't very good to you.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.345
I'm not proud of that.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.681
[softly] It could have been worse.

39:52.765 --> 39:54.433
[Mink groans]

39:54.517 --> 39:56.185
[groans]

39:56.268 --> 39:58.312
This is really sweet moment,

39:59.897 --> 40:02.274
but deeply unpleasant for me

40:03.984 --> 40:06.028
because now I must kill you too.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.864
-[exhales heavily]
-Dimitri! Davai.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.494
Saddle stitch.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.124
Pizdets.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.544
-What the hell, Minkie?
-Oh, shit!

40:22.086 --> 40:25.631
-Did you really need to off poor Dimitri?
-Yes, sorry.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.011
He heard the safe word.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.222
Like we couldn't come up with another one?

40:33.305 --> 40:34.140
What?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.641
I'm sorry.

40:38.477 --> 40:42.106
But now we make love.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.108
What?

40:44.191 --> 40:47.903
Yes, we will, naughty boy.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.240
-[both moaning]
-What is happening?

40:53.659 --> 40:54.535
Um…

40:57.329 --> 40:58.372
So, uh,

40:59.373 --> 41:02.668
you guys did this
out of some kind of a kink role play?

41:03.711 --> 41:04.712
[Whitney] I told you.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.756
Fantasies can be made real.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.383
[Mink moans loudly]

41:09.467 --> 41:12.970
Oh, my beautiful sladka.
The things I will do to you.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.264
Does baby need the muzzle?

41:15.347 --> 41:16.307
[Mink moans]

41:16.390 --> 41:20.060
Do not promise if you do not do.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.645
You'd better watch it.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.231
I'm getting riled up
and I'm all out of oil.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.692
I don't need…

41:30.112 --> 41:32.198
[breathing heavily] A dry pontoon?

41:32.698 --> 41:33.699
[Mink] Mmm.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.243
Mama likes it.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.328
Now,

41:38.329 --> 41:39.538
to my ship.

41:40.414 --> 41:41.248
[groans]

41:43.501 --> 41:45.044
What about her?

41:45.127 --> 41:46.879
I send Gregor to fetch her.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.924
She is family,
perhaps I put tracker on her too.

41:51.884 --> 41:54.678
You're going to be
an amazing father to her.

41:57.848 --> 41:58.849
[Mink] What?

42:02.686 --> 42:03.604
Bye, Mom!

42:05.981 --> 42:06.899
[Whitney gasps]

42:09.401 --> 42:10.778
That's my girl.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.991
[Faye] I really appreciate it.

42:16.075 --> 42:19.703
Especially after all the shit
that I pulled.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.788
Uh…

42:21.664 --> 42:22.665
Whatever, I…

42:24.124 --> 42:26.502
-I should have trusted you both.
-Yeah.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.338
Well,

42:30.965 --> 42:33.008
I might have been a bit of a…

42:33.092 --> 42:34.009
Of a dick?

42:36.512 --> 42:37.513
At first.

42:38.722 --> 42:39.723
Thank you, guys.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.524
-[Jet] You want to do the honors?
-Uh…

42:48.607 --> 42:51.527
No, you do it. I…
I don't know how to work that thing,

42:51.610 --> 42:53.320
so you can do it.

43:20.472 --> 43:21.640
[piano playing]

43:30.858 --> 43:34.320
[chuckles nervously] Uh,
hi, me, in the future.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.989
-It's, uh, me.
-[laughs]

43:38.073 --> 43:40.576
You from 15 years ago.

43:42.828 --> 43:45.039
How are you? Are you doing all right?

43:48.375 --> 43:53.005
Myself 15 years from now,
it's almost impossible to imagine.

43:55.549 --> 43:56.925
Are… are you alone?

43:57.009 --> 44:01.847
Or… or is there a wonderful person
sitting next to me? To you?

44:03.641 --> 44:07.519
Knowing me, I'm sure you're causing all
kinds of trouble to all kinds of people.

44:07.603 --> 44:08.812
[young Faye chuckles]

44:08.896 --> 44:11.732
Even though you don't mean to, but…

44:12.274 --> 44:13.817
It's gonna be all right.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.863
Today you are who you are today.
You're still me, but a newer version,

44:17.946 --> 44:21.909
and you're not perfect,
but you've got a lot to give.

44:21.992 --> 44:25.871
So always remember,
I'm rooting for you, future self.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.543
You can do it, all right?

44:31.627 --> 44:34.922
Go me! Go me! Go me! Yay!

44:35.589 --> 44:37.591
[piano music continues]

44:50.729 --> 44:51.814
[music stops]

44:52.940 --> 44:55.275
-Did you get it?
-[woman] I got it.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.819
How was it? Did I do okay?

44:56.902 --> 44:59.613
-[woman] You were beautiful, sweetheart.
-Thanks, Mom.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.246
[whispers] Mom.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.673
[piano music playing]
