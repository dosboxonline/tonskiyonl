WEBVTT

03:49.813 --> 03:51.690
What a dick.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.610
I keep saying, let's sell our own fish.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.279
They tried it down the Cape.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.156
That all went to hell.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.074
So keep bitching. That'll work.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.285
I got to go. Love you, Dad.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.162
Don't forget about the doctor.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.873
And the nets.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.666
I know.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.045
Bye, shit-face.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.757
Bye, twat waffle.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
What's wrong?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.991
Turn it down!

06:56.542 --> 06:57.543
It's loud!

06:58.043 --> 07:00.420
You didn't change after fishing.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.339
You stink.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.761
I love rap music.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.598
My whole ass is vibrating.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.352
Just drive!

07:23.277 --> 07:26.572
It's definitely itchy as hell.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.704
My nuts are on fire.

07:38.959 --> 07:43.380
They're like angry hard little beets.

07:44.173 --> 07:48.635
Covered in barnacles.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.554
I got it!

07:51.889 --> 07:54.558
And your mother's got it even worse.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.688
Like a boiled lobster claw.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.326
You guys have jock itch.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.710
You two need clean underwear.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.420
And...

08:23.504 --> 08:25.172
you're not allowed to do it anymore.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.883
What?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.260
For how long?

08:30.344 --> 08:31.970
Never again.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.222
Done for life.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.769
Two weeks.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.604
-Impossible.
-Can't do it.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.925
Take those off. It's rude.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.973
I can't focus.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.977
Go eat.

09:30.821 --> 09:34.366
You know why God made farts smell?

09:36.285 --> 09:39.913
So deaf people could enjoy them too.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.092
Don't slouch. You'll get stuck.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.802
Fifteen bucks, really?

09:53.886 --> 09:56.805
You choose weed, I choose wine.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.435
You don't want her! Swipe left.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.937
None of them smile?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.523
So? She's hot.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.692
When I was modeling...

10:09.943 --> 10:13.530
Yes! Your mother was the best!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.908
First year I met her,
she won the Yankee Miss Pageant.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.703
Beat all those hearing girls.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.664
She was hotter than all of them.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.128
What about her?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.339
So-so.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.762
I thought we said no Tinder at the table!

10:38.263 --> 10:41.350
How is music rude but Tinder's okay?

10:42.976 --> 10:46.855
Because Tinder is something
we can all do as a family.

14:58.524 --> 15:00.692
The card was declined!

15:03.987 --> 15:05.948
I'll move money around tomorrow.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.324
It's embarrassing!

15:07.407 --> 15:08.659
What do you want me to do?

15:08.742 --> 15:12.621
I gotta pay for ice, fuel.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.710
Maybe we should sell the boat?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.129
And then what?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.760
It's the one thing I know how to do!

16:12.598 --> 16:14.808
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.543
$800 a day.

16:42.211 --> 16:45.839
That's more than we make in a day!

16:45.923 --> 16:47.549
Don't tell me. Tell them.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.003
Hi!

19:31.004 --> 19:34.383
Do you have a second to call Grandma?

19:35.092 --> 19:36.593
Use the video relay.

19:37.803 --> 19:40.055
It's awkward to talk to an interpreter.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.310
Leave her alone. She's with a friend.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.706
What's up with Gertie?

21:30.332 --> 21:33.001
She just told me she has herpes.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.404
Dad's out back.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.574
Stop. I got this.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.296
Ruby, get out of here. Out of here!

26:43.437 --> 26:44.938
It's medical.

26:45.480 --> 26:49.401
I don't think being deaf
makes it legal to spark a fatty.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.153
What the hell was that?

26:52.029 --> 26:53.989
I got the price up, didn't I?

26:54.072 --> 26:57.993
I was handling it!
You made me look stupid.

26:58.076 --> 27:01.580
No, you look stupid when Gio throws out
any number he wants

27:01.663 --> 27:03.665
and you can't cross-check it!

27:04.333 --> 27:05.334
Guys!

27:06.710 --> 27:08.295
You want to fight,

27:08.754 --> 27:12.466
go fight those assholes!

27:13.926 --> 27:16.386
Our family sticks together.

27:21.141 --> 27:25.896
I'd give my left nut to tell them
to go screw themselves.

27:28.482 --> 27:29.650
So do it!

27:30.567 --> 27:32.778
Who's gonna sell our fish?

27:33.195 --> 27:34.321
Us!

34:10.050 --> 34:12.094
I joined the choir.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.347
Why?

34:16.389 --> 34:18.766
I like to sing.

34:25.565 --> 34:26.775
What?

34:30.195 --> 34:32.739
You're a teenager.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.788
If I was blind, would you want to paint?

35:16.825 --> 35:18.702
We should do a co-op.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.955
Look, there's empty warehouses everywhere.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.709
We could organize a business.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.253
Get the other boats on board.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.379
How?

35:29.463 --> 35:31.423
Who's gonna support us?

35:31.840 --> 35:34.176
We're the deaf guys!

35:35.761 --> 35:39.097
They look at us like we're a joke.

35:45.229 --> 35:46.271
I'm gonna go with them.

35:46.355 --> 35:48.524
You want me to text Ruby?

35:48.607 --> 35:49.942
No.

35:50.359 --> 35:52.736
I'm a grown man!

43:39.620 --> 43:42.372
We need to discuss this.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.460
We had no idea you were home.

43:47.044 --> 43:49.922
The doctor said you're not even
supposed to have sex!

43:50.339 --> 43:52.382
Look at your mother!

43:52.466 --> 43:54.134
Hot!

43:55.052 --> 43:58.388
How am I supposed to control myself?

44:00.307 --> 44:01.308
Sit.

44:04.228 --> 44:07.523
I want to know what your intentions are.

44:09.191 --> 44:11.485
You two have to use condoms, okay?

44:13.737 --> 44:15.989
Put a helmet on that soldier.

44:41.515 --> 44:43.100
You guys are the worst!

49:23.755 --> 49:25.007
Sorry.

49:25.090 --> 49:26.550
You gotta interpret. I'm lost.

49:49.573 --> 49:50.741
Like hell it is.

51:45.480 --> 51:46.523
Double it?

51:46.982 --> 51:49.276
I have no idea.
It sounded good though, right?

51:52.154 --> 51:53.614
What?

51:56.491 --> 51:58.243
It just came out.

51:58.535 --> 51:59.620
I was in the moment.

51:59.703 --> 52:02.122
How would that even work?

52:02.456 --> 52:06.210
We get customers to sign up.
They buy fish right off the boat.

52:07.920 --> 52:12.299
Do you know how much work that is?
There are so many steps!

52:12.799 --> 52:14.551
I've looked into it.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.971
There's no money for it.

52:18.055 --> 52:20.390
You do our books.

52:20.474 --> 52:22.226
You could work with the other wives.

52:23.477 --> 52:25.771
Those hearing bitches
want nothing to do with me.

52:29.107 --> 52:30.817
And you! You hate people!

52:32.194 --> 52:34.279
We could finally be part
of this community.

52:34.947 --> 52:36.073
We have our community.

52:36.156 --> 52:37.324
Who?

52:37.407 --> 52:38.825
Your deaf friends?

52:38.909 --> 52:40.536
You see them once a month.

52:41.828 --> 52:44.331
What's the problem? It's a great idea!

52:46.792 --> 52:49.294
We can't talk to these people.

57:50.762 --> 57:52.764
I can't fit all these in the car.

57:55.976 --> 57:57.811
Where are you going?

57:58.228 --> 57:59.730
I have my music practice.

58:00.189 --> 58:01.523
You can't go.

58:06.069 --> 58:07.154
What's this?

58:07.237 --> 58:09.072
The news!

58:09.156 --> 58:10.866
They're doing a story on the family!

58:12.201 --> 58:13.202
Now?

58:14.244 --> 58:15.370
I can't.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.041
How are we gonna do the interview?

58:19.124 --> 58:20.459
I can lip read.

58:20.542 --> 58:21.919
You're not going to get all of it!

58:22.002 --> 58:23.003
This is important.

58:24.505 --> 58:25.672
Do it!

58:28.759 --> 58:30.636
You want us to fail?

58:59.665 --> 59:03.335
Basically, the fishermen are
at the mercy of the big guys.

59:14.054 --> 59:16.598
The goal is to sell fish
directly to the people.

1:01:45.747 --> 1:01:47.916
I want to go to college.

1:01:48.584 --> 1:01:49.626
At Berklee.

1:01:52.087 --> 1:01:53.589
Music school.

1:01:55.215 --> 1:01:58.010
My teacher's been helping me
with my audition.

1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:02.806
College? In Boston?

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:05.642
That city is full of assholes.

1:02:07.853 --> 1:02:09.563
You can't go now.

1:02:09.646 --> 1:02:11.231
We just started the business. With you!

1:02:11.315 --> 1:02:13.442
That's all you care about?

1:02:14.193 --> 1:02:16.445
Losing your free interpreter?

1:02:16.528 --> 1:02:20.449
You're an important part of this.

1:02:21.408 --> 1:02:22.826
It's terrible timing.

1:02:29.666 --> 1:02:33.879
Nobody expects that from you.

1:02:34.379 --> 1:02:35.547
I...

1:02:36.048 --> 1:02:39.134
have been interpreting my whole life.

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.722
This is exhausting.

1:02:47.726 --> 1:02:49.937
Singing is what I love.

1:02:51.897 --> 1:02:53.357
It's everything.

1:02:58.987 --> 1:03:00.739
Did you know about this?

1:03:10.707 --> 1:03:12.417
We can't let her go.

1:03:13.752 --> 1:03:15.462
It's college.

1:03:16.004 --> 1:03:17.005
It's not.

1:03:17.089 --> 1:03:18.674
It's music school.

1:03:20.217 --> 1:03:23.512
And what if she can't sing?

1:03:24.555 --> 1:03:26.181
Maybe she's awful.

1:03:26.598 --> 1:03:27.933
She's not awful.

1:03:28.016 --> 1:03:29.351
Really? Have you heard her?

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.315
I'm worried. What if she fails?

1:03:36.358 --> 1:03:37.484
I'm tired.

1:03:37.568 --> 1:03:39.152
I don't wanna talk anymore.

1:03:45.826 --> 1:03:48.370
What do we do if she gets in?

1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:50.956
Then she's gone.

1:03:51.707 --> 1:03:53.417
Our baby's gone!

1:03:54.459 --> 1:03:56.128
She's not a baby.

1:03:56.211 --> 1:03:57.212
She's my baby!

1:03:57.296 --> 1:03:58.714
She was never a baby.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:46.970
Where is Ruby?

1:04:47.846 --> 1:04:48.889
She's pissed.

1:04:48.972 --> 1:04:50.349
Yeah, but today?

1:04:53.435 --> 1:04:55.437
Is that the observer, seriously?

1:04:58.524 --> 1:04:59.942
I should make her jump.

1:05:58.917 --> 1:06:01.545
Should I throw her overboard?

1:12:28.056 --> 1:12:29.057
What happened?

1:12:30.517 --> 1:12:32.644
You didn't come to work.

1:12:32.728 --> 1:12:34.563
We're done fishing.

1:12:34.646 --> 1:12:36.481
They suspended my license.

1:12:37.566 --> 1:12:38.734
Who?

1:12:39.526 --> 1:12:40.527
Coasties.

1:12:40.611 --> 1:12:43.739
The observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off.

1:12:46.116 --> 1:12:47.910
We were just working

1:12:47.993 --> 1:12:50.913
and they came to board us. We didn't know.

1:12:52.206 --> 1:12:53.415
You need a hearing deckhand.

1:12:54.625 --> 1:12:56.084
Yeah, that's you!

1:12:56.168 --> 1:12:57.211
You were that person!

1:12:59.963 --> 1:13:01.840
She's right. We need another guy.

1:13:01.924 --> 1:13:03.091
We can't afford it!

1:13:05.302 --> 1:13:08.305
If you'd told me you weren't coming,

1:13:08.388 --> 1:13:10.766
I'd have figured something out.
But you didn't.

1:13:11.475 --> 1:13:13.393
You're seriously blaming me?

1:13:14.228 --> 1:13:16.230
Your father was counting on you.

1:13:20.317 --> 1:13:23.111
No. Don't put this on me.

1:13:25.447 --> 1:13:27.533
It's not my fault.

1:14:04.695 --> 1:14:09.283
We can't pay that unless
we can get back on the water.

1:14:53.785 --> 1:14:56.038
I'll sell the boat.

1:14:56.121 --> 1:15:00.209
Take the money we can. That'll be that.

1:15:01.168 --> 1:15:02.419
It's fine.

1:15:03.086 --> 1:15:04.546
I'll stay.

1:15:05.714 --> 1:15:07.883
I'll work with you on the boat.

1:15:07.966 --> 1:15:09.510
No!

1:15:09.593 --> 1:15:10.677
Yes.

1:15:10.761 --> 1:15:12.804
We can't afford to pay someone else.

1:15:14.890 --> 1:15:17.809
And there's nobody that's
gonna know how to sign.

1:15:19.478 --> 1:15:20.812
Are you sure?

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.190
School can wait.

1:15:25.234 --> 1:15:27.194
I already decided.

1:15:28.612 --> 1:15:30.072
I'm excited.

1:15:34.952 --> 1:15:37.079
Oh, Saint Ruby!

1:15:37.162 --> 1:15:39.373
We'll make a shrine to you on the boat.

1:15:39.456 --> 1:15:40.415
Wait!

1:15:40.499 --> 1:15:41.500
She's trying to help!

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.669
Well, thank God you have her.

1:16:08.902 --> 1:16:10.821
Don't kill me.

1:16:12.573 --> 1:16:18.495
I bought you a red dress for your concert.

1:16:24.168 --> 1:16:26.837
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

1:16:31.633 --> 1:16:34.386
I'm really glad you're staying.

1:16:37.222 --> 1:16:38.640
Leo isn't.

1:16:39.641 --> 1:16:40.976
It's complicated.

1:16:41.351 --> 1:16:42.686
He feels...

1:16:43.395 --> 1:16:44.521
left out.

1:16:45.564 --> 1:16:46.899
That's crazy.

1:16:48.233 --> 1:16:50.652
It's always the three of you

1:16:50.736 --> 1:16:51.945
and then me.

1:16:55.449 --> 1:16:57.075
I get it.

1:17:07.002 --> 1:17:10.714
Do you ever wish I was deaf?

1:17:24.019 --> 1:17:27.564
When you were born, at the hospital,

1:17:28.774 --> 1:17:31.443
they gave you a hearing test.

1:17:33.070 --> 1:17:37.407
And there you were, so tiny and sweet,

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:42.204
with these electrodes all over you.

1:17:44.164 --> 1:17:46.667
And I...

1:17:47.459 --> 1:17:50.504
prayed that you would be deaf.

1:17:53.048 --> 1:17:55.676
When they told us

1:17:55.759 --> 1:17:57.469
that you were hearing,

1:17:58.679 --> 1:18:00.222
I felt...

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:03.517
My heart sank.

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:04.768
Why?

1:18:05.727 --> 1:18:09.147
I was worried that we wouldn't connect.

1:18:09.731 --> 1:18:11.859
Like me and my mom,

1:18:11.942 --> 1:18:13.485
we're not close.

1:18:14.903 --> 1:18:17.906
I thought I would fail you.

1:18:18.574 --> 1:18:21.451
That being deaf would make me a bad mom.

1:18:26.790 --> 1:18:27.958
Don't worry.

1:18:28.667 --> 1:18:30.252
You are a bad mom

1:18:31.003 --> 1:18:33.130
for so many other reasons.

1:18:36.717 --> 1:18:39.845
I know I drive you crazy

1:18:39.928 --> 1:18:42.598
with the clothes, the makeup.

1:18:49.897 --> 1:18:51.648
But honestly,

1:18:51.732 --> 1:18:55.194
I'm happy that you know who you are.

1:18:57.988 --> 1:18:59.489
You're brave.

1:18:59.948 --> 1:19:01.533
Not like me.

1:19:46.662 --> 1:19:47.746
Get lost.

1:19:48.413 --> 1:19:49.498
You hiding?

1:19:50.499 --> 1:19:52.376
Not very well.

1:19:57.214 --> 1:19:58.215
You still mad at me?

1:20:00.050 --> 1:20:02.052
You can't fish full-time.

1:20:02.135 --> 1:20:03.136
Why not?

1:20:05.556 --> 1:20:07.057
Gertie told me

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:08.976
that you can really sing.

1:20:09.476 --> 1:20:11.311
That's special.

1:20:12.396 --> 1:20:13.981
You can't stay here.

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:17.734
They'll keep looking to you
for everything.

1:20:17.818 --> 1:20:19.820
What else am I supposed to do?

1:20:20.946 --> 1:20:22.114
Let me do this!

1:20:22.197 --> 1:20:23.407
I got this!

1:20:23.490 --> 1:20:25.242
I'm the older brother.

1:20:25.325 --> 1:20:27.244
And I get treated like a baby.

1:20:27.327 --> 1:20:29.872
I haven't been able to do a thing
with Fresh Catch!

1:20:29.955 --> 1:20:31.957
Because it all involves
talking to hearing people!

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:33.917
So what? Who cares!

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:36.962
You're so afraid that we'd look stupid.

1:20:37.045 --> 1:20:39.673
Let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people!

1:20:40.174 --> 1:20:42.885
We're not helpless.

1:20:45.804 --> 1:20:49.474
Our family was fine before you were born.

1:20:53.187 --> 1:20:54.563
Go.

1:21:29.932 --> 1:21:31.350
Ruby.

1:21:45.030 --> 1:21:46.156
Can you read his lips?

1:21:47.783 --> 1:21:48.825
Not really.

1:21:54.248 --> 1:21:55.666
They laughed.

1:22:25.988 --> 1:22:28.407
Ruby looks beautiful.

1:22:30.284 --> 1:22:32.578
You have good taste.

1:22:34.329 --> 1:22:37.541
I like how her red dress
matches the curtains.

1:22:54.474 --> 1:22:55.851
She's good.

1:22:57.561 --> 1:22:59.646
-She's good.
-No idea.

1:22:59.730 --> 1:23:01.857
-No, she said.
-Oh!

1:23:50.906 --> 1:23:51.907
What's wrong?

1:23:52.574 --> 1:23:54.034
My buttons are off.

1:24:01.917 --> 1:24:04.044
What do you want for dinner?

1:24:04.753 --> 1:24:08.215
-Spaghetti.
-I'll have to go to the grocery store.

1:25:19.328 --> 1:25:22.039
First song done, second song done.

1:28:03.033 --> 1:28:08.205
This is my teacher, Mr. V. And his family.

1:28:10.499 --> 1:28:11.667
Nice to fuck you.

1:28:32.479 --> 1:28:33.981
It's fine. I get it.

1:28:35.023 --> 1:28:36.942
Nice to screw you too.

1:28:58.839 --> 1:28:59.840
What is he saying?

1:29:31.371 --> 1:29:34.833
I'm gonna get some air.

1:29:35.334 --> 1:29:36.502
Okay.

1:29:48.889 --> 1:29:50.807
What's up?

1:29:52.392 --> 1:29:54.311
Just thinking.

1:29:58.023 --> 1:30:02.236
The stars here,

1:30:02.319 --> 1:30:07.241
they don't look as good as
they do on the water.

1:30:22.089 --> 1:30:27.469
The song you sang tonight.
What was it about?

1:30:33.934 --> 1:30:35.978
It was about...

1:30:37.688 --> 1:30:41.108
what it is to need another person.

1:30:44.236 --> 1:30:48.282
Can you sing it for me?

1:30:49.283 --> 1:30:50.492
Now?

1:30:50.576 --> 1:30:52.160
Please.

1:31:24.818 --> 1:31:28.947
Louder. More!

1:32:51.071 --> 1:32:52.447
Are we fishing?

1:32:52.531 --> 1:32:53.532
No.

1:33:12.593 --> 1:33:16.597
If we're kicking you out,
we're all doing it as a family.

1:33:40.204 --> 1:33:42.122
Maybe over there?

1:33:59.348 --> 1:34:01.058
I'm gonna park.

1:34:08.774 --> 1:34:10.859
Look how they're dressed.

1:34:10.943 --> 1:34:12.486
It's so different.

1:34:13.070 --> 1:34:15.531
It's fine. You look pretty.

1:34:34.216 --> 1:34:35.592
What did she say?

1:34:36.093 --> 1:34:37.553
You can't go in.

1:35:59.635 --> 1:36:03.263
Let's go upstairs.

1:43:26.999 --> 1:43:29.126
You sure you don't want us to come?

1:43:29.209 --> 1:43:30.919
We can help set up your dorm room?

1:43:37.718 --> 1:43:40.053
Bye-bye, ass monkey.

1:43:40.554 --> 1:43:42.264
Bye, shit nugget.
