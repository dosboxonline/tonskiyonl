Hey, Johnny.

Hey, how's she doing?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.566
[Amanda] No updates yet.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.484
She's still unconscious.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.361
They're monitoring the bleeding.

00:30.822 --> 00:34.325
-I need you to do something for me.
-Of course. Anything.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.078
With Miguel dropping out,
Miyagi-Do is down a fighter.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.331
Find Kenny Payne
and put him on a flight to Barcelona.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.625
Of course. I'll go right now.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.502
-[Johnny] Thanks, Amanda.
-Yeah.

-Your mom's gonna be fine. Don't worry.
-Yeah.

00:49.966 --> 00:50.842
Sorry.

[somber music continues]

01:00.935 --> 01:03.605
Can you maybe do that later
so the rest of us can get on?

Relax, buddy.

Hey, look. Stay calm, okay?

01:09.819 --> 01:12.197
Last thing we need to do
is get kicked off the plane. Please.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.281

01:13.990 --> 01:15.033

"Neat" means "no ice," babe.

-Yeah, but this one's already made.
-Sir, are you gonna be a problem?

01:27.212 --> 01:29.422
Honestly? Probably a little.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.553
Oh man, what a day.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.433
I can't even imagine
what Johnny's going through.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.353
I just wish we could do something.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.562
Yes, of course.

01:45.271 --> 01:49.400
But, uh, we also have
big problem here, Daniel-san.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.779
I knew Kreese hated my guts,
but kidnapping me?

01:53.279 --> 01:54.489
Come on, man.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.784
How did Kreese know you were searching
for answers about Miyagi?

01:57.867 --> 01:58.952
His partner.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.288
She was there when I was asking Gunther
about the headband.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.083
She probably set
his whole scheme in motion,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.627
and now they got this long-haired brute
doing their dirty work.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.047
If Kreese thinks he can pull this shit
and get away with it,

02:11.131 --> 02:12.507
he's got another thing coming.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.676
Looks like we got LaRusso rattled.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.136
Good.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.597
Now the real fun begins.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.974
Dial up the pressure.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.851
Enemy soldiers

02:23.810 --> 02:25.103

02:37.949 --> 02:39.242
[Kim Da-Eun] I don't approve.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.786
Our team should be focused
on the tournament.

02:41.870 --> 02:46.416
I won't have my grandfather's students
risking the shame of disqualification

02:46.499 --> 02:48.710
for petty fights off the mat.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.713
Your grandfather is the one that taught me

02:52.922 --> 02:57.051
that battles aren't reserved
for the battlefield.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.889
The kids will be fine.

Trust me.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.726
[Chozen] Trust me, Daniel-san.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.353
Kreese expects retaliation,

03:07.437 --> 03:09.314
so we must show restraint.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.899
Focus on competition.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.275
[Daniel sighs]

03:12.358 --> 03:14.485
We will take revenge on mat.

I'm sorry I was not there
to help you, Daniel-san.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.955
I was in very bad place.

03:26.956 --> 03:27.999
Feel great shame.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.126
But now I am focused.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.931
But if we're gonna stand down,
we've gotta go into defense mode.

to clear our minds tonight.

Is it cool if we hit the town?

03:53.983 --> 03:56.527
Only if you hit the town hard. [laughs]

03:56.611 --> 03:57.445

Do not worry, Daniel-san.

04:44.909 --> 04:48.830
-Did you talk to Miguel before he left?
-For, like, 30 seconds.

We were so excited about
exploring Barcelona together. And now…

04:53.167 --> 04:54.335
How are you feeling?

04:54.961 --> 04:55.795
Not great.

04:56.587 --> 05:00.300
-Thinking about adding rum to this Coke.
-Yeah, right. You don't drink.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.176
Now might be a good time to start.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.388
I've been screwing everything up
since Tory put us on a break.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.350
And you know what makes it worse
is it's not even affecting her.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.853
She's fighting better than ever.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.688
Tory chose the other side.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.774
And I feel terrible for her.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.611
But we can't keep letting her
get in our heads like this.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.156
It's time to accept that she's against us.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.235
I come bearing great news.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.780
How do you feel about a trip to Spain?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.406
-What?
-[Amanda] I'm sorry.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.658
That sounded like
I was selling a timeshare.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.911
A spot opened up in Miyagi-Do,

06:09.994 --> 06:12.205
and they need you
to compete in the Sekai Taikai.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.458
Yeah, I'm… I'm not doing that.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.213
-Have a good day, Mrs. LaRusso.
-Wait, wait. You don't wanna go?

06:21.130 --> 06:24.384
No offense, but I don't want
any part of Miyagi-Do.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.302
Not after what your son put me through.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.637
This is about Anthony?

I mean, I knew you had your issues,
but I thought everything was fine now.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.894
Fine? He drugged me
and made me crap my pants.

06:35.853 --> 06:36.813
You haven't heard?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.272
Look up "Shit Butt" memes.

-Trying to get us home faster.
-What?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.047
Excuse me, stewardess.
Why is the plane doing this bendy thing?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.926
You mean following the curvature
of the Earth?

07:08.094 --> 07:11.681
Map looks flat to me. Tell the pilot
to fly straight. We're trying to get home.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.479
Hey, man. Listen, everything's
gonna be all right. Don't worry.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.358
How can you tell me that
when my mom might be dying?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.194
-I'm just trying to help.
-Well, you're not. Okay?

07:25.862 --> 07:29.615
You were disregarding me all tournament.
And you're making things worse right now.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.535
You'll probably make things worse
at the hospital too.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.787
Like drinking in the parking lot
when Robby was born.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.956
No wonder Robby's so messed up.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.126
Hey, man, that's a low blow.
Don't bring Robby into this.

you didn't get captain,

07:42.253 --> 07:45.006

-No.

-No.

-Come on.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.991
Need to go inside. Looking for teenagers.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.285
I heard that one before.
All right? Get lost.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.788
See, I told you. No teens inside.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.499
You let her cut the line?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.541
Yeah, she's hot.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.376
What are you doing here?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.213
Looking after my students.
What are you doing here?

08:25.296 --> 08:27.006
Looking after my students.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.176
Or maybe you're looking
to make more trouble for Miyagi-Do.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.386
Not unless you give me a reason to.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.223
No, no, no, no.
Take whatever this is someplace else.

If you're looking for teenagers,
try the beach district.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.618
My sponsors are paying
for this whole trip anyway.

08:56.702 --> 09:00.206
You should take some photos so you can
remember your one trip to the big time.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.001
Maybe I'll take a photo of you
on the mat at the finals.

09:05.753 --> 09:06.754
Knocked out.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.506
Next to all of your teeth.

Thanks for the drink.

-Yeah, so do you.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.861
Oh shit, she's coming over.

We have girlfriends. We love
our girlfriends. Think with that head.

Qué tal, boys? Having fun tonight?

09:37.201 --> 09:38.786
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Fun night.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.372
I like your hair. It's so cute.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.415
Thank you.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.874
I have a girlfriend though.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.378
Well, how about you, tall man?

09:47.461 --> 09:48.796
Do you want to dance?

09:48.879 --> 09:50.256
I thought you'd never ask.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.509
-[Hawk] What…?
-[Demetri] I'm on vacation.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
[upbeat music continues]

10:06.147 --> 10:09.108
Is your boyfriend better at kissing
than he is at fighting?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.484
Stop that.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.862
What? I'm just being friendly.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.866
[bartender] What can I get you?

10:17.783 --> 10:18.618
Uh…

10:19.994 --> 10:21.329
Can I get a rum and Coke?

-Double, please.
-[bartender] Right away.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.918
-[Daniel] Don't think he's gonna make it.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.054
Sorry. Sorry. But come on. That's…

10:38.679 --> 10:39.930
That's objectively funny.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.599
I haven't seen this one. This--

10:42.266 --> 10:43.517
You should be ashamed.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.480
I'm ashamed I have a son
that's capable of that kind of bullying.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.690
You think I did this?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.526
You've done nothing but mess with him
since he's moved here.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.486
This wasn't me.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.696
It is hard enough being a new kid.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.990
Plus, his dad is overseas,
his mom works nights,

10:58.074 --> 11:00.076
and he's gotta
deal with kids being assholes?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.994
He's been just as much of a jerk to me.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.163
We are not keeping score, Anthony.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.541
This beef ends today.
We need to get Kenny on a plane.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.002
The only way that's gonna happen
is if you apologize.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.839
No. No way. No, I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't even do, Mom!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.509
I am not asking.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.635
Get in the car.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.519
Yeah, this isn't making me feel better.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.020
No offense.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.980
[woman] It's not your fault, Pickles.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.945
Well, some people just can't be helped.
Bless his heart.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.574
Sir, you can't be here.

-Miguel.
-Oh my God.

Miguel!

-Come on, man.
-[man] Hey!

11:49.625 --> 11:53.838

He doesn't want to speak to you.
Have a seat.

No, no, I'm… I… I have a boyfriend.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.015
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.

[melancholy music plays]

24:05.986 --> 24:08.113
[Demetri] I cannot believe
you would rat me out to Yas.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.364
She dumped me.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.742
This is not my fault. You were the one
dancing with another girl.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.787
You just can't handle
that she wanted me over you.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.248
[Hawk] What are you talking about?
I turned her down.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.625
[Demetri] No, it's fine.
Obviously, you're jealous.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.044
But to ruin my relationship over it?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.046
That is a new low, even for you.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.132
Okay, no one here is jealous.

Some people cannot take

Accountability.

24:47.986 --> 24:48.987
Sorry for yelling.

There's just a lot going on.

I know you're trying to make things right,

25:09.049 --> 25:10.717
Becoming an elite karate fighter.

Which you did faster than anyone I know.
