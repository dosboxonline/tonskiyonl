00:10.594 --> 00:12.262
Ma-- Magnus?

00:16.975 --> 00:17.976
Magnus?

00:21.146 --> 00:22.481
Magnus!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.191
Magnus?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.073
<i>Hello?</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:34.576
<i>Hello?</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.371
<i>Magnus?</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:39.331
<i>Magnus?</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:41.291
<i>Jo?</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:44.878
<i>We need to get you help.
I'm coming over, okay?</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:54.179
I need an ambulance.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.563
My husband has-- has his-- hit his head.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.274
He's unconscious.
I need an ambulance as soon as possible.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.071
- I don't want you hiding in here anymore.
- I want to go into bed.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.906
It's okay. We're going for a drive.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.201
Why? Where's Daddy?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.203
He just went for a walk.
It's just gonna be you and me.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.955
It's gonna be a little adventure.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.126
Where are we going?

01:25.294 --> 01:26.753
How long are we going for?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.092
What happened to your cheek?

01:32.676 --> 01:33.677
Can we call him?

01:34.845 --> 01:35.971
Alice, I'm your mother.

01:35.971 --> 01:39.516
It's okay for you to go with me in a car.
We'll call him on the way, okay? Uh-huh?

01:43.562 --> 01:44.938
Okay, hop in the car.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.258
I love you.

02:23.352 --> 02:26.063
<i>I didn't remember. I don't remember.</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:29.107
<i>I know you could all hear me
when I was up there!</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:30.692
- <i>Mamma?</i>
- <i>Alice!</i>

02:58.637 --> 02:59.805
What the fuck?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.312
<i>They're doing
something very fiddly at the CAL.</i>

03:07.312 --> 03:10.983
<i>Core temperature: minus 203 degrees.</i>

03:10.983 --> 03:13.944
- <i>Tune lasers. Come on.</i>
- <i>What does it do?</i>

03:13.944 --> 03:16.029
<i>It's looking for a new state of matter.</i>

03:16.822 --> 03:18.156
<i>What's does that mean?</i>

03:20.492 --> 03:22.578
<i>It's looking for a new state of matter.</i>

03:22.578 --> 03:24.580
- <i>What's does that mean?</i>
- <i>Don't know.</i>

03:25.372 --> 03:26.874
<i>Eighty-four days till you're home.</i>

03:26.874 --> 03:28.000
<i>Only 84.</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:30.294
<i>They're doing
something very fiddly at the CAL.</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:55.879
Henry.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.594
Henry.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.723
Shut up.

05:08.851 --> 05:09.935
Shut up!

05:29.913 --> 05:30.914
Hello?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.012
Who's out there?

05:46.180 --> 05:49.516
You identify yourself or fuck off!

06:10.662 --> 06:11.496
Hello?

06:46.823 --> 06:47.824
Yeah?

06:48.617 --> 06:51.203
Henry, are you okay?

06:51.745 --> 06:52.746
Yeah. I--

06:53.580 --> 06:55.123
You're taking your pills?

06:57.835 --> 07:02.631
Listen, they announced the Nobel Prize.
I was thinking of you.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.715
Uh-huh?

07:04.383 --> 07:09.179
"The key focus is how quantum mechanics
allows two or more particles

07:09.179 --> 07:13.016
to exist in what is called
an entangled state.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.937
What happens to one of the particles
in an entangled pair

07:16.937 --> 07:22.067
determines what happens to the other,
even if they are far apart."

07:25.070 --> 07:27.281
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm--

07:27.281 --> 07:28.949
Haven't been better in years.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.123
<i>Henry?</i>

07:39.084 --> 07:40.335
<i>Henry?</i>

08:08.071 --> 08:11.074
- Ilya.
- <i>You got vitamins, right? At Star City.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:13.827
Hello, Jo.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.122
What does it say on the bottle?
On the prescription label?

08:17.706 --> 08:21.043
Do you know the ISS is full of cracks?

08:21.043 --> 08:23.128
It's like an old china teacup.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.713
<i>What does it say on the label?</i>

08:26.215 --> 08:30.135
In my best reading voice,
"Vitamin D, B-12"--

08:30.135 --> 08:32.971
<i>It says, "A," right? Parenthesis A.</i>

08:32.971 --> 08:34.681
Parenthesis A, check.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.184
So mine says "B."

08:38.684 --> 08:42.606
So you, Audrey and Yaz all got A,
and I got B.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.858
Well, maybe you should have worked harder.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.071
<i>Very funny. Mine are different.
Mine are antipsychotics.</i>

08:50.072 --> 08:51.073
<i>Ilya?</i>

08:51.073 --> 08:53.075
Could you go to the beginning on this?

08:53.075 --> 08:57.120
So I went in for my psych evaluation.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.957
They said I had PTSD.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.627
They got me on medication, Pharmolith.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.255
And the pills looked
exactly like my vitamins.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.090
So I checked it, and they are the same.

09:08.090 --> 09:11.260
If they look the same, Jo,
maybe you just mixed them up.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.098
Do you seriously think
that's something I would do?

09:16.849 --> 09:17.850
<i>No.</i>

09:18.475 --> 09:23.355
So I put it through an AAS,
and it's lithium.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.983
It's an isomer of lithium. Lithium-7.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.695
<i>I didn't make a mistake.</i>

09:31.738 --> 09:34.157
Why would they give you lithium
at Star City?

09:34.741 --> 09:39.580
Maybe because I said that I saw something
that nobody wanted me to see.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.877
Ilya, they-- they could hear me
when I was up there.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.797
They could hear me
when I was all alone on ISS and I--

09:48.797 --> 09:50.424
and I thought there was no connection.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.801
No, they couldn't, Jo.
I was there. They couldn't.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.179
They're giving lithium pills
to astronauts.

09:56.722 --> 09:57.556
Why?

09:57.556 --> 09:59.725
- <i>You honestly think--</i>
- Wait a minute.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.853
<i>Hello? Jo?</i>

10:05.606 --> 10:07.274
There's something wrong, Ilya.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.068
- Jo?
- <i>Hold on a second.</i>

10:24.499 --> 10:25.751
What is this?

10:28.670 --> 10:29.963
Ice.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.257
Why?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.761
Ice is not illegal, is it?

10:40.265 --> 10:41.266
I guess not.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.520
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.943
I wanna play you something.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.992
Mum?

11:01.078 --> 11:01.954
<i>Jo?</i>

11:04.122 --> 11:06.166
You know what,
my phone is gonna be off for a while.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.918
So I'm gonna--

11:11.505 --> 11:14.466
Can you please just check your pills
for me? Analyze them.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.969
<i>I'll call you back. Don't speak to anyone.</i>

11:22.391 --> 11:25.227
- Who was that?
- It was just Mummy's colleague.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.563
Are you hungry, love?

12:02.848 --> 12:03.849
Irena.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.726
I need your help.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.937
I'm sorry, you need to come
and pick up the pieces.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.318
<i>Hi, you've reached Constantina Caldera.</i>

12:14.318 --> 12:15.527
<i>Leave a message.</i>

12:15.527 --> 12:17.613
Hey-- Hey, Connie, it's Papa.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.867
I was wondering if--

12:22.701 --> 12:25.370
You know, I've been taking care
of myself and...

12:27.164 --> 12:29.791
And I was wondering if you had
any plans for Thanksgiving.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.753
Yep. Give me a call.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.686
<i>This is Tensy. I'm not here.</i>

12:49.686 --> 12:52.314
Well, if you're not here,
I don't know if I am.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.566
Makes it kind of hard to talk.

12:56.151 --> 13:01.865
Listen, I was wondering, you know,
Thanksgiving, before it's too late?

13:03.492 --> 13:04.493
Love to your mom.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.789
Ask her what the fuck she did
with the money from the Pontiac.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.878
<i>Ask her what the fuck she did
with the money from the Pontiac.</i>

13:35.524 --> 13:36.817
<i>Henrietta Caldera.</i>

13:36.817 --> 13:38.110
<i>Leave your message.</i>

13:43.490 --> 13:46.451
Hey, honey. It's your kind-of father.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.556
Can I ask you something?

14:08.891 --> 14:11.476
- Sure.
- It's about hiding in cupboards.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.313
Why do you do it?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.024
I don't know.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.445
'Cause to me, it looks like something
you would do if you're afraid.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.573
Is there something you're afraid of?

14:33.165 --> 14:36.710
Could we maybe give this fear a name?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.297
Just afraid sometimes. That's all.

14:41.840 --> 14:46.053
But last night you said that you,
you saw Wendy's dad.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.388
A funeral.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.725
You said that you thought I was dead.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.980
But you're here now, so...

14:59.024 --> 15:00.442
But did you really see that?

15:11.328 --> 15:12.704
Valya.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.289
Valya?

15:15.707 --> 15:16.708
The Valya.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.545
The thing that I...

15:21.797 --> 15:23.131
that scares me.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.384
Is "the Valya" a person?

15:28.053 --> 15:30.764
What does "the Valya" do?
Why does it scare you?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.434
She kind of tricks me.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.436
It's a she?

15:36.979 --> 15:38.897
She tricks me into not playing.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.483
Hiding.

15:42.901 --> 15:43.902
What is she?

15:47.030 --> 15:49.408
I don't know. She's a dream.

15:52.327 --> 15:56.290
Do you wanna draw her for me?
Do you wanna draw the Valya for me?

16:01.628 --> 16:02.629
You okay?

16:03.547 --> 16:07.801
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.096
You look worried too. And...

16:18.812 --> 16:21.023
I'll draw you my worry
if you draw me yours.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.193
Okay.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.278
It's a deal?

16:27.112 --> 16:28.238
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.949
Just gonna go and make a quick phone call.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.285
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Yeah.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.453
Yeah.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.510
<i>Laurentz.</i>

16:49.510 --> 16:50.552
Oh, hello.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.221
Who is this?

16:52.721 --> 16:54.806
My name is Johanna Ericsson.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.643
I'm an astronaut attached to ESA.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.520
Why would you be calling me?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.523
<i>Well, I'm on my way to you.</i>

17:03.232 --> 17:04.566
<i>You sent me some tapes.</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:09.905
I don't think you can be
who you say you are.

17:10.489 --> 17:13.700
<i>If you got a tape or something
from my sister,</i>

17:14.242 --> 17:15.577
<i>she's insane.</i>

17:15.577 --> 17:17.454
<i>Laurie, who is it?</i>

17:19.330 --> 17:20.332
Hello?

17:42.813 --> 17:46.191
"Over many years, they faked
these tapes and used them to attempt...

17:46.692 --> 17:49.736
They're not simply cranks.
They're criminals."

18:18.599 --> 18:20.684
- Jo?
- <i>Magnus, I'm so sorry.</i>

18:20.684 --> 18:22.227
<i>Are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>

18:22.895 --> 18:25.063
I'm fine. Where's Alice?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.523
She's here. She's fine.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.609
Jo, you have to come back now.

18:28.609 --> 18:29.693
- Give me the phone.
- Back off.

18:29.693 --> 18:33.739
I'm so sorry. I made a huge mistake. I--
Everything just--

18:33.739 --> 18:36.992
Give me the phone or I dismiss your wife
from her job immediately.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.585
Hi, Jo. We understand
what you're going through. It's fine.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.213
- Just tell me where you are.
- <i>Put Magnus back on.</i>

18:50.339 --> 18:52.966
<i>We both just wanna know
where you are so we can help you.</i>

18:52.966 --> 18:54.426
Is it Daddy?

18:54.426 --> 18:56.553
Can you put Magnus back on, please?

18:56.553 --> 18:59.306
<i>You're going to go with Irena Lysenko.
She's an expert in this.</i>

18:59.306 --> 19:00.390
<i>She can treat you.</i>

19:02.809 --> 19:03.810
<i>Jo?</i>

19:05.229 --> 19:06.396
Where have you seen this?

19:07.606 --> 19:09.149
Have you heard me talk about the accident?

19:10.526 --> 19:11.610
<i>Jo?</i>

19:11.610 --> 19:14.696
How do you know-- When did you see this?

19:14.696 --> 19:15.781
Jo.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.788
<i>Where are you?</i>

19:22.788 --> 19:23.872
We went for a ride.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.415
I can come out to meet you.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.628
<i>I need to ask you something,
and I want you to answer me truthfully.</i>

19:30.128 --> 19:31.129
Of course.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.550
Why was I given antipsychotic medication
at Star City?

19:36.176 --> 19:37.386
You weren't.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.429
<i>After I gave my evidence at the inquiry,</i>

19:39.429 --> 19:42.015
<i>you came up to me
and asked if I was taking my pills.</i>

19:43.600 --> 19:44.643
Why did you do that?

19:45.519 --> 19:47.563
Did you know what they were?
Was that why you asked?

19:47.563 --> 19:49.982
- As far as I know, they're vitamins.
- They're lithium.

19:51.692 --> 19:54.653
- Tell me the truth.
- When you come back, we can discuss it.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.238
Give Magnus back the phone.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.075
Put Magnus back on, please.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.623
Jo, you have to come back now.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.792
I love you. We'll be back soon. Bye.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.588
Jo?

20:39.031 --> 20:40.240
What is your clearance?

21:15.526 --> 21:20.113
These medical documents
are no longer available.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.215
There's a car.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.217
Call the police.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.510
Call the police!

21:48.016 --> 21:50.853
You were looking at medical records. Why?

21:52.437 --> 21:53.355
Why do you ask?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.483
We have a report from the ESA

21:57.025 --> 21:59.027
that Commander Ericsson is missing.

22:00.195 --> 22:01.405
What?

22:01.405 --> 22:04.908
She assaulted her husband
and took away their child.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.287
She has stolen scientific equipment
from the ESA.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.664
Have you heard from her?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.919
She needs to get in touch with me

22:15.919 --> 22:18.046
if she wants help.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.549
If I hear anything, I'll tell you.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.322
What is this?

22:46.325 --> 22:48.493
Mamma just needs to ask
some questions here.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.225
<i>Yes?</i>

23:11.892 --> 23:14.311
I'm Jo Ericsson. You sent me a letter.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.900
Mummy! Look.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.290
Yes?

23:36.792 --> 23:40.587
Hi. I'm Jo Ericsson.
This is my daughter, Alice.

23:42.339 --> 23:43.590
What do you want?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.135
I want to know what you recorded.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.096
You sent me a letter.

23:50.681 --> 23:51.849
I have your tapes.

24:10.993 --> 24:12.911
There is no need to worry.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.540
I am 85, and I have osteoporosis.

24:17.040 --> 24:22.004
So if you give me a good kick in the ass,
I'll fall over and turn to dust.

24:23.463 --> 24:27.801
Welcome to
the Skagerrak Marine Observatory.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.018
Get the police!

24:38.437 --> 24:41.607
Stop squealing like a stupid guinea pig.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.026
This is Johanna Ericsson.

24:44.026 --> 24:48.071
She's not! This woman is a crisis actor.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.240
What's a crisis actor?

24:50.240 --> 24:52.743
This is a setup, Wallie!

24:52.743 --> 24:55.454
They'll send us to prison again!

24:55.454 --> 24:56.914
Chocolate?

24:56.914 --> 25:01.460
That is my brother, Laurentz.
He has dementia.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.711
What?

25:02.711 --> 25:04.254
You're very beautiful.

25:05.255 --> 25:08.926
It's so many years
since we've met a real astronaut.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.011
Would you please tell me
how you got that tape?

25:11.011 --> 25:15.057
It was my dream
that I might one day go into space myself.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.228
She needs to tell us
why she has come here.

25:19.228 --> 25:23.440
People don't usually come here. There.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.234
Well, I came here because--

25:25.234 --> 25:27.528
'cause nobody believes me
about what I saw.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.489
I saw the body of a female cosmonaut.

25:30.489 --> 25:33.075
And that's what caused the collision
on the ISS.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.787
But they're trying
to make me say otherwise.

25:37.454 --> 25:38.997
They're trying to put me somewhere.

25:39.498 --> 25:41.041
They're telling me I'm going mad.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.631
You sent me a tape of a lost cosmonaut.

25:48.757 --> 25:52.427
And a tape of me when I was up there
when no one could hear me.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.097
My brother heard you--

25:55.931 --> 25:57.224
imperfectly, of course--

25:57.850 --> 26:00.978
talking about this dead body
when you were on the ISS.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.897
Bu-- But how?

26:03.897 --> 26:06.066
It's one of our ghost tapes.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.068
Ghost tapes?

26:08.068 --> 26:09.736
You are not to discuss the ghost tapes.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.738
You are not to discuss them.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.740
I am ten minutes older than you!

26:13.740 --> 26:15.826
You're so goddamn naive.

26:15.826 --> 26:19.830
If only you'd shut up,
we would have had easier lives.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.915
And how much longer have we got?

26:23.625 --> 26:30.090
Our father gave us the money
for a listening console, 1949.

26:30.674 --> 26:33.844
There were lots of things left over
from after the war.

26:34.553 --> 26:41.018
And three secondhand recorders
from a US Army surplus auction.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.190
It was like the tracking room
at Cape Kennedy.

26:47.858 --> 26:49.067
This is us.

26:51.486 --> 26:52.487
At the time,

26:53.322 --> 26:56.450
there were six or seven
different individuals

26:56.450 --> 26:58.327
across the world doing the same.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.537
Amateurs.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.581
The brothers in Italy.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.418
Some Australians and Americans.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.462
Doing what?

27:08.462 --> 27:12.174
Taking their own recordings
of what was happening up there.

27:12.883 --> 27:17.137
Sputnik, you know. Laika, the little dog.

27:18.889 --> 27:20.140
That's Star City.

27:21.058 --> 27:23.310
- Oh, yeah. It is.
- You're right.

27:23.310 --> 27:26.438
And at Houston in Texas too.

27:26.939 --> 27:30.817
They invited us out there.
They were impressed with us.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.528
They were watching us.

27:32.528 --> 27:34.238
That's Henry.

27:35.989 --> 27:39.826
- Yeah.
- He came here in 1982.

27:40.744 --> 27:43.372
We had a very bad time
when he came that night.

27:43.372 --> 27:46.500
- What did he do?
- He wanted the tapes of course.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.043
Of Apollo 18?

27:48.043 --> 27:49.294
Ha!

27:51.421 --> 27:54.299
If I remember correct,
there was an accident on Apollo 18.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.469
And Henry Caldera was the only survivor.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.722
He was an alcoholic and a failure.

28:01.473 --> 28:02.933
He wasn't like he is now.

28:08.272 --> 28:11.358
We have to go out on the boat.

28:12.234 --> 28:13.902
I don't wanna go out on the boat.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.655
I wanna know how you got the tapes.

28:16.655 --> 28:20.117
But you can only hear the ghost tapes
when you are out on the water.

28:20.117 --> 28:23.287
Nobody is listening to any ghost tapes!

28:23.287 --> 28:26.373
Laurentz, she's not a crisis actor.

28:27.249 --> 28:31.003
She wants some answers. Just like us.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.926
Come.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.871
The ghost tapes.

29:07.873 --> 29:10.250
She hasn't shown any inclination
to hurt Alice.

29:10.834 --> 29:11.835
She'll be back.

29:14.213 --> 29:15.923
This is a fucking nightmare.

29:17.674 --> 29:18.800
I'm gonna call the police.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.845
I don't know how seriously
the police are going to take it.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.138
They've only been away a few hours.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.140
We've established she's in the middle
of a psychotic episode.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.975
Let's see how seriously
the police take that.

29:28.393 --> 29:31.897
If you go to the police, Magnus,
there's no way that it doesn't leak.

29:31.897 --> 29:34.566
There's no way
it doesn't become a huge story.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.777
She's gonna be the crazy psycho astronaut

29:36.777 --> 29:38.779
who saw a ghost
and kidnapped her daughter.

29:39.363 --> 29:40.489
She'll lose her job.

29:41.532 --> 29:42.908
She'll lose her reputation.

29:44.034 --> 29:45.035
Do we want that?

29:51.166 --> 29:52.793
Did you know this might happen?

29:56.088 --> 29:58.966
Some astronauts come back
with a deterioration in their eyesight.

29:59.466 --> 30:00.676
Happens to most of them.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.846
We don't tend to discuss it.
It's collateral damage.

30:03.846 --> 30:05.138
But this isn't that.

30:07.683 --> 30:09.977
Some of them burn out.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.896
We don't tend to discuss that either.

30:20.487 --> 30:21.780
Things go wrong.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.701
Big things happen that they do not want
to explain or admit to.

30:25.701 --> 30:26.785
Like what?

30:26.785 --> 30:28.453
Well, in 1984,

30:28.453 --> 30:33.584
the USSR was running
a small space station called Salyut 7.

30:33.584 --> 30:37.963
And three cosmonauts saw
an orange glow surrounding the ship.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.339
And they all witnessed

30:39.339 --> 30:43.969
what they described as angels
hovering around them in space.

30:43.969 --> 30:49.892
They watched it for ten minutes
until the whatever-they-were disappeared.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.853
You can call that hallucination,

30:52.853 --> 30:58.483
but ten days later,
another three cosmonauts joined the crew

30:58.483 --> 31:02.279
and all six of them saw the same thing.

31:02.279 --> 31:03.572
Again.

31:03.572 --> 31:05.157
That is a fact.

31:05.699 --> 31:09.036
The transcript of the comms exists.

31:09.036 --> 31:14.082
It was reported in the newspapers
in the USSR.

31:14.082 --> 31:18.504
There was
a detailed official investigation.

31:18.504 --> 31:20.756
You don't think they were angels, right?

31:21.715 --> 31:23.008
Maybe, yes.

31:23.717 --> 31:26.637
Laurentz thinks maybe, yes.

31:26.637 --> 31:28.013
It's just a ghost story.

31:28.013 --> 31:31.725
But what else is your dead cosmonaut
but a ghost story?

31:32.226 --> 31:35.646
Another ghost story
that has been brought back from up there.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.985
Who are they? I think they're nuts.

31:42.486 --> 31:44.655
People see things up there.

31:45.322 --> 31:48.992
They hear dogs barking,
and they hear voices.

31:49.535 --> 31:53.747
And when they get back home,
a lot of people seem to go crazy.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.675
For a long time, we thought it was static.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.177
We caught some seconds of static
every now and again.

32:07.803 --> 32:10.222
The other recordings are crystal clear.

32:11.139 --> 32:14.935
So we just left it on the tapes,
and we forgot all about it.

32:15.602 --> 32:18.021
Until Apollo 18.

32:18.856 --> 32:24.403
The recording we had of Apollo 18
was drenched in that noise.

32:25.195 --> 32:27.656
But Laurentz,
he thought he could hear something.

32:28.490 --> 32:31.785
Do they hear this noise?
At NASA? In Russia?

32:31.785 --> 32:32.870
Yes.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.747
But they can't decode it.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.082
Decode?

32:38.000 --> 32:42.588
You see, we have trained ourselves
to pick out the sounds.

32:42.588 --> 32:44.798
Laurie is much better than me.

32:45.424 --> 32:47.426
He taught himself to understand Russian.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.307
We have to go five miles out.

32:53.307 --> 32:56.518
Five miles out, the sound is clearest.

32:56.518 --> 32:59.563
You need to go to a liminal place.

32:59.563 --> 33:05.277
Somewhere between places,
like out on the water or up in space.

33:05.277 --> 33:08.614
You need to lose yourself
in order to hear.

33:37.809 --> 33:42.856
This was recorded
on the 23rd of November, 1967.

33:43.398 --> 33:45.526
It's a young female cosmonaut

33:45.526 --> 33:49.279
whose capsule is malfunctioning
on her return to Earth.

33:52.574 --> 33:56.286
And if you listen very closely,
you can hear what she's saying.

33:58.163 --> 34:01.208
But you must really want to listen.

34:04.795 --> 34:08.090
- This woman clearly died.
- I-I-I can't--

34:08.090 --> 34:10.259
This woman could be your corpse.

34:14.263 --> 34:15.264
Mummy?

34:15.264 --> 34:16.306
What?

34:16.306 --> 34:17.850
I-It's just noise.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.686
You have to train your ears.

34:22.437 --> 34:24.313
It kind of could be anything.

34:25.023 --> 34:26.024
Wait.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.072
This is just made-up.

34:34.824 --> 34:35.826
Stop it!

34:40.163 --> 34:44.083
The same day,
Irena Lysenko went into space

34:44.083 --> 34:46.712
and supposedly came back again
in one piece.

34:50.007 --> 34:53.092
So, what do you wanna hear next?

34:54.261 --> 34:55.762
You want Apollo 18?

34:56.513 --> 34:58.932
Or you want Paul Lancaster?

35:00.017 --> 35:02.269
- Paul Lancaster died.
- Oh, did he?

35:03.478 --> 35:04.813
Did he die though?

35:04.813 --> 35:06.023
Yes, he did.

35:06.523 --> 35:09.484
Laurentz heard him. And I also heard him.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.278
Sorry, but no, you didn't.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.324
But then you came back instead.

35:16.867 --> 35:19.703
And you, Dr. Ericsson,
you were perfectly fine.

35:19.703 --> 35:22.998
But Commander Lancaster was not.

35:22.998 --> 35:24.208
Do you wanna hear it?

35:24.708 --> 35:25.709
No.

35:36.512 --> 35:38.597
It's just faces in the fire.

35:40.265 --> 35:43.393
500 people have been in space.

35:44.311 --> 35:45.896
Beyond the Kármán line.

35:46.396 --> 35:51.652
And amongst them you have alcoholics,
lunatics, psychotics, kidnappers,

35:51.652 --> 35:55.030
and people who think
that the aliens live amongst us.

35:55.030 --> 35:57.866
As you would
in any random sample of people.

35:58.534 --> 36:00.494
But these are not random samples.

36:01.203 --> 36:04.289
These are the best of the best.
They're vetted. They're trained.

36:04.289 --> 36:06.625
They're not people who randomly crack up.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.001
Can we go in now?

36:08.502 --> 36:12.464
Mum, please. Please.

36:15.384 --> 36:18.971
There's something about space
that is wrong.

36:20.722 --> 36:23.058
Nothing of this is evidence of anything.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.271
- Mummy!
- Listen!

36:27.271 --> 36:28.480
It's enough.

36:33.694 --> 36:34.695
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:36.822 --> 36:37.823
I'm sorry.

36:39.867 --> 36:40.868
We'll go back.

36:42.703 --> 36:43.704
I'm sorry.

36:57.801 --> 36:58.802
Hello?

36:59.303 --> 37:00.387
<i>Daddy?</i>

37:00.387 --> 37:02.723
Oh, God, Alice. Are you okay?

37:02.723 --> 37:04.641
<i>I don't know. She's not really herself.</i>

37:05.434 --> 37:08.103
- <i>She hasn't hurt you or anything?</i>
- No, of course not.

37:08.103 --> 37:09.855
- We're in Denmark.
- You're where? Look, I'm gonna--

37:09.855 --> 37:12.024
- I'm gonna come and get you.
- <i>We'll have gone</i>.

37:12.024 --> 37:14.443
She's taking us up to the cabin
in Vindelälven.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.739
She was worried
that you would put her in hospital.

37:18.739 --> 37:21.074
Alice, will I be able to call you
on this number?

37:21.074 --> 37:22.492
<i>She doesn't know I'm calling you</i>.

37:22.492 --> 37:24.870
I want to take care of her.
I don't want her to go away.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.539
She's not gonna go anywhere. Look, I'm--

37:27.539 --> 37:30.000
- I'll be with you as soon as I can.
- I gotta go.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.084
Ali--

37:37.007 --> 37:40.719
You see,
when you train your mind to listen,

37:40.719 --> 37:42.513
you can hear these things.

37:43.138 --> 37:44.890
It's not just make-believe.

37:46.642 --> 37:47.935
It isn't.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.937
It isn't make-believe, little Alice.

37:51.355 --> 37:54.441
In the book, Alice always tried to believe

37:54.441 --> 37:58.028
six impossible things before breakfast.

37:59.696 --> 38:00.697
I liked your boat.

38:01.198 --> 38:02.366
Thank you.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.744
And thank you that you came.

38:07.329 --> 38:08.664
- These--
- No.

38:08.664 --> 38:10.249
- These are yours.
- No!

38:10.249 --> 38:11.959
- I really don't need to take them.
- Yes.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.585
- They're yours. Take them.
- No!

38:14.127 --> 38:15.128
They're yours.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.184
Do we go home now?

38:36.358 --> 38:37.526
Not quite yet.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.125
I want to come up with you.

38:54.084 --> 38:55.085
That's unnecessary.

38:55.085 --> 38:57.212
It is vital that I do, if she has the CAL.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.173
The CAL can no longer be operational.

39:00.174 --> 39:02.801
- Why do you need it?
- It is my experiment.

39:02.801 --> 39:04.469
Michaela's been in touch with me.

39:04.970 --> 39:09.391
To request that I revoke your access here
and put you and the CAL on a flight home.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.435
No, I need it because I--

39:14.479 --> 39:15.647
What?

39:18.567 --> 39:19.651
Henry.

39:22.196 --> 39:23.447
What?

39:50.849 --> 39:52.226
I am coming with you.

39:54.937 --> 39:56.355
I just need to change.

40:13.747 --> 40:14.915
When are we there?

40:15.415 --> 40:16.416
Soon.

40:17.501 --> 40:18.627
You okay?

40:19.795 --> 40:20.796
I don't know.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.632
I don't really know what's what.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.259
Are you okay?

40:26.969 --> 40:29.429
You gotta be good at putting things
in different boxes

40:30.305 --> 40:31.765
when you're an astronaut.

40:32.891 --> 40:35.269
Put it in a box, shut it,

40:36.228 --> 40:37.813
be able to not worry about it.

40:39.731 --> 40:41.817
And deal with something else
in a different box.

40:41.817 --> 40:43.485
Maybe we should get some boxes.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.904
Some real ones.

40:46.488 --> 40:47.698
Like my beads.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.535
Wait, you need that box.

40:52.744 --> 40:53.745
First box.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.710
Garbage bag.

41:00.544 --> 41:01.545
Garbage bag?

41:02.379 --> 41:05.924
I didn't see a garbage bag
with a smiley skeleton.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.637
It was a woman's body.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.347
The Valya.

41:13.307 --> 41:14.725
That's what hit the ISS.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.023
Second box.

41:22.691 --> 41:23.692
Paul dying.

41:26.069 --> 41:27.446
What was going on up there.

41:27.946 --> 41:30.282
When I was on my own, seeing things.

41:31.909 --> 41:34.203
What I saw since I got home.

41:35.037 --> 41:37.372
- Third box.
- Those tapes.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.084
- Fourth?
- Pills.

41:44.129 --> 41:45.130
Fifth.

41:46.048 --> 41:50.469
You and me and Daddy.
That's the most important box.

41:52.638 --> 41:53.555
What's in it?

41:55.432 --> 41:57.518
Feeling bad that I left you for one year.

41:58.810 --> 41:59.811
Hurting you.

42:01.939 --> 42:03.357
Feeling bad for hurting Daddy.

42:05.150 --> 42:06.318
How did you hurt Daddy?

42:11.031 --> 42:12.032
Alice, I--

42:13.575 --> 42:14.576
Who's the Valya?

42:18.622 --> 42:19.623
This woman.

42:20.582 --> 42:22.167
She's floating around Earth.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.379
She's dead.

42:27.631 --> 42:29.049
She's a dead cosmonaut.

42:34.763 --> 42:38.350
But you didn't hear me talking
about the accident.

42:39.309 --> 42:40.310
No.

42:43.605 --> 42:44.773
Is the Valya me?

42:47.067 --> 42:48.610
She doesn't speak like you.

42:48.610 --> 42:50.112
So she speaks.

42:52.698 --> 42:56.827
- But, I thought she was dead.
- She's a bit alive and a bit dead.

42:57.995 --> 42:59.079
She's kind of like...

43:02.332 --> 43:04.251
I wish that tape was clear.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.128
Which one?

43:06.712 --> 43:09.339
November 23rd, 1967.

43:31.028 --> 43:32.988
See, it doesn't work. It's just noise.

43:34.698 --> 43:37.492
<i>...Fire! Fire! Capsule is on fire!</i>

43:38.160 --> 43:39.369
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

43:39.369 --> 43:41.121
Mummy, that's the Valya.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.041
Mum!

43:45.709 --> 43:46.543
Mum.

43:48.337 --> 43:50.130
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

43:55.636 --> 43:57.221
<i>Forty, forty-two.</i>

43:57.221 --> 43:58.555
<i>I'm hot, I'm hot.</i>

44:03.894 --> 44:06.438
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

44:06.438 --> 44:07.689
<i>I'm hot.</i>

44:07.689 --> 44:09.608
<i>Fire! Capsule is on fire!</i>

44:10.526 --> 44:12.194
<i>Twenty-one. Twenty-one.</i>

44:12.194 --> 44:14.446
Does her voice sound like that?

44:14.446 --> 44:15.447
Y-Yes.

44:15.447 --> 44:20.077
<i>Thirty, forty, forty-two.
I'm hot. I'm hot.</i>

44:20.661 --> 44:23.247
<i>The world is the wrong way around.</i>

44:28.210 --> 44:29.211
Bud?

44:31.129 --> 44:32.130
Bud.

44:35.300 --> 44:36.301
Bud?

44:40.848 --> 44:41.932
Can you hear me?

44:47.396 --> 44:49.314
Loud and clear, Houston.

44:59.533 --> 45:01.702
You stopped taking your pills.

45:05.539 --> 45:06.915
Enough is enough.

45:08.333 --> 45:11.628
I designed a machine, the Cold Atomic Lab.

45:11.628 --> 45:14.173
It was aboard the ISS.

45:14.173 --> 45:15.048
It--

45:17.176 --> 45:18.927
I think it's made everything worse.

45:21.597 --> 45:23.098
I don't take an interest.

45:23.724 --> 45:26.476
Is there an astronaut
called Johanna Ericsson?

45:27.102 --> 45:28.770
I'm coming to get you, Henry.

45:29.897 --> 45:31.106
Sooner or later.

45:31.690 --> 45:34.776
You can't. What's done is done.

45:35.611 --> 45:36.695
Oh, I'm comin'.

45:37.779 --> 45:41.116
And boy, am I gonna fuck things up.

45:42.451 --> 45:44.203
I don't even know if you're there.

45:44.912 --> 45:47.247
How can you possibly touch me?

45:47.247 --> 45:51.835
Well, I made you piss your pants.

45:59.384 --> 46:03.180
<i>...conditions worse. Why don't you answer?</i>

46:04.431 --> 46:07.434
<i>There are flames. Fire! Fire!</i>

46:07.434 --> 46:09.061
<i>Capsule is on fire.</i>

46:10.187 --> 46:11.271
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

46:12.940 --> 46:14.733
<i>Forty, forty-two. I'm hot, I'm hot.</i>

46:14.733 --> 46:17.236
What's she saying? Mummy?

46:17.236 --> 46:19.071
<i>The world is the wrong way around.</i>

46:19.071 --> 46:23.534
She's saying that
the world is the wrong way around.

46:24.034 --> 46:26.078
<i>There are flames. Fire! Fire!</i>

46:26.078 --> 46:27.621
<i>Capsule is on fire.</i>

46:28.705 --> 46:30.082
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

46:54.064 --> 46:54.898
Shit.

46:56.233 --> 46:58.402
- What?
- What's this?

46:58.902 --> 46:59.903
It's the way.

47:03.323 --> 47:06.660
There aren't two roads here.
I've been here, like, a million times.

47:08.579 --> 47:11.164
It's okay. It's that one.

47:16.795 --> 47:18.297
Or we just go across the lake.

47:19.173 --> 47:20.215
Mummy.

47:20.215 --> 47:22.134
It's okay, people do it all the time here.

47:22.134 --> 47:24.678
We've done it before.
Come on, unbuckle your seat belt.

47:42.029 --> 47:43.030
Mummy.

47:49.912 --> 47:50.829
Mummy, I'm scared.

47:50.829 --> 47:52.247
It's okay, baby.

47:52.247 --> 47:53.957
What's that noise?

47:53.957 --> 47:56.126
- It's just the ice.
- What?

47:56.126 --> 47:58.128
Don't worry. It's, like, a meter thick.

48:45.133 --> 48:46.134
Mamma?

49:23.297 --> 49:24.798
<i>Hey, Alice. Good morning.</i>

49:25.966 --> 49:27.259
<i>Have you just woken up?</i>

49:27.259 --> 49:29.469
<i>Did you dream of Earth or space?</i>

49:31.013 --> 49:32.055
<i>Earth.</i>

49:32.806 --> 49:33.932
<i>We have to whisper.</i>

49:34.474 --> 49:35.684
<i>What time is it?</i>

49:35.684 --> 49:38.270
<i>About half an hour till dawn.</i>

49:40.564 --> 49:41.607
<i>I miss you.</i>

49:42.482 --> 49:44.193
<i>Look, there you are.</i>

49:44.943 --> 49:46.945
<i>Wave to yourself.</i>

49:48.655 --> 49:49.698
<i>Mamma?</i>

49:53.118 --> 49:54.119
<i>Mamma?</i>

49:54.828 --> 49:56.538
<i>Jo!</i>

49:56.538 --> 49:57.789
Mummy, who was that?

49:58.707 --> 49:59.917
No one.

49:59.917 --> 50:01.293
That was Wendy's dad.

50:02.252 --> 50:03.253
No.

50:04.505 --> 50:07.299
No, that was you and me.
Right before the accident.

50:08.008 --> 50:09.092
That was not me.

50:14.973 --> 50:16.600
I don't speak Swedish.

50:20.479 --> 50:21.980
I don't call you "Mamma."

50:48.131 --> 50:49.550
Mamma!
