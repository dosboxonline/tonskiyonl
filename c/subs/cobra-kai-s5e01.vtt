00:18.435 --> 00:22.480
[Silver] Within every punch and kick
lies centuries of tradition.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.232
It has a rich past.

[Silver] While our martial arts
date back hundreds of years,

00:34.409 --> 00:38.329
our dojo is committed
to providing state-of-the-art training.

00:38.413 --> 00:42.709
But a dojo is more than mats and machines.
It's about the students.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.379
At Cobra Kai,
we transform kids into champions.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.676
We are proud to be the home of the first
female All Valley Tournament champion,

02:02.205 --> 02:03.540
[Amanda] This is not okay, Daniel.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.583
It is crazy enough you flew him here.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.877
You didn't tell me
he was gonna be living with us.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.505
You definitely didn't say
anything about him being a nudist.

02:10.588 --> 02:14.175
[sighs] He's not a nudist.
He's just a man of routine.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.428
In Okinawa, he'd start every morning
bathing in his local hot spring.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.472
So let's get him a membership to the YMCA.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.433
There are places he can be naked
that aren't our backyard.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.603
-I can't believe this is happening.
-It won't happen again. I--

02:25.687 --> 02:28.356
I'm not talking about the pool.
I'm talking about all of this.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.025
You said the All Valley was the end of it.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.361
Sam and Tory had their match.
Nobody got hurt.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.488
Kreese even went to jail.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.491
It's a karate miracle!
This should be over.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.451
I know, but with Terry Silver in charge

02:40.535 --> 02:43.079
and Cobra Kai expanding,
they're more of a threat than ever.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.123
If I don't do something,
it's only a matter of time

02:45.206 --> 02:47.542
before he's brainwashed
all the kids in the Valley.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.713
I'm not worried about all the kids
in the Valley. I'm worried about our kids.

02:51.796 --> 02:55.633
[sighs] I promise you, Amanda,
I will not put our kids in danger.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.510
How can you keep that promise, Daniel?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.597
Because of Chozen. That's why he's here.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.764
It's summer, Daniel.

03:02.932 --> 03:06.144
Call me crazy, but I thought
we'd be having Mai Tais by the pool,

03:06.227 --> 03:09.647
not watching your Okinawan assassin
use it as his training ground.

and women here

12:53.397 --> 12:55.941
can be part of our championship dojo.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.778
-And--
-This is what we're up against.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.239
Terry Silver.
This is how everyone sees him.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.950
As some kind of philanthropist
out to save the kids of the Valley.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.119
That's why you're here.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.706
I tried to stop Cobra Kai on my own.
Nothing's worked.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.458
There's only one way to end this.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.377
We have to cut the head off the snake.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.422
Hai, Daniel-san. I can do that.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.175
[grunts]

13:21.258 --> 13:25.095
Hey, whoa. No. No, no.
I didn't mean literally cut his head off.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.764
They are not for cutting.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.809
They are for blocking, and stabbing,

13:29.892 --> 13:32.061
and clawing, and gouging.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.605
Still, please, put 'em away
before Amanda sees them.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.403
What I meant was we need
to expose Silver for who he really is.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.988
Then his students will see the light.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.826
The problem is
Silver may be crazy, but he's not dumb.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.955
He always thinks two moves ahead.
You have to be careful with this guy.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.748
No, Daniel-san.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.584
He must be careful with this guy.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.253
[suspenseful music plays]

13:59.880 --> 14:01.632
Take me to Terry Silver.

[cell phone buzzes]

14:52.600 --> 14:54.226
-Miguel?
-Hey, Sam.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.104
Where are you?
Are you okay? I kept calling and, and--

14:57.187 --> 15:01.400
Yeah, look, I-I just didn't want anyone
to know where I was until I found my dad.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.735
Did you find him?

15:02.818 --> 15:05.821
Well, that's… That's actually
why I'm calling right now.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.157
The process has been
harder than I expected--

15:08.240 --> 15:09.575
That's why you're calling?

15:10.075 --> 15:13.370
Your mom is so worried. You left without
telling anyone where you were going.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.998
Well, I knew if I told you,
you'd try to stop me.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.416
Because we care about you.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.210
Miguel, what you're doing
is really dangerous.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.088
Your mom and grandma left Ecuador
to get away from your dad.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.715
They probably did it for a good reason.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.091
I… I…

15:26.926 --> 15:28.010
-I…
-[dumpster lid slams]

15:30.429 --> 15:32.348
[Sam] Gonna ask
what happened at the tournament?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.600
You knew what it meant
for me to face Tory.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.770
You're not gonna ask if I won or lost?

15:38.354 --> 15:41.106
Sam, h-how are you making this
about you right now?

15:41.190 --> 15:44.944
I'm not. I… I just thought
you'd be in my corner.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.030
Okay, well, what about my corner?
You… You have no idea.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.199
There are more important things
than karate.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.909
Yeah, there are.

15:54.078 --> 15:54.995
[sighs]

15:55.079 --> 15:58.958
[in Spanish] Hector!
What are you doing? That's Rogelio's job.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.793
[in English] What?

16:00.876 --> 16:04.546
[in Spanish] He's really tired. He just
had a baby. We have to give him a break.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
Sometimes you're too nice, Hector.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.053
-[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

[emotional music plays]

16:15.432 --> 16:17.393
Where did LaRusso hide the lug wrench?

16:23.440 --> 16:26.360
-I lived in here, remember?
-Of course I remember.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.284
How the hell'd you get this car anyway?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.162
I went looking for you.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.084
After you went missing,
me and LaRusso tried to find you.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.919
We found this hunk of junk instead.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.966
We found some pissant driving it.
We chased him to a chop shop.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.719
Ended up fighting
the douchebags that stole it.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.638
I had no idea.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.641
[sighs]

16:58.475 --> 17:02.396
I know I haven't been there for you,
Robby. More times than I can count.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.025
But I've also failed Miguel.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.863
Hell, I'm the reason
he ran off in the first place.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.995
I'm out here trying to fix my mistakes
so I don't have to live with regret.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.291
If you're serious about making things
right, you can start by helping Miguel.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.836
I know you have regrets
when it comes to him.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.921
[emotional music plays]

17:29.715 --> 17:33.052
I'm gonna call Carmen. I'll be right back.
Finish taking these off.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.143
-Johnny. Are you at the bus station yet?
-[Johnny] Uh…

17:41.935 --> 17:44.229
We had car trouble.
Be there in a few hours.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.814
Any updates? Hear from Miguel?

17:45.898 --> 17:49.526
No, but I did hear from Sam.
Miguel called her. He's okay.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.946
All right. That's great.
Did she say where he's going?

17:53.030 --> 17:56.116
All Sam knows is
that Miguel hasn't found Hector. Yet.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.160
I feel sick to my stomach

17:58.243 --> 18:01.371
with Hector having no idea he has a son
and Miguel not answering my calls.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.123
Maybe I should come down there.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.042
No, there's no reason
to put yourself in danger.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.920
Who knows what Hector could do
if he sees you again.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.130
It's under control.
I'll find him, I promise.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.007
-It's gonna be okay.
-Okay.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.886
[dramatic music plays]

18:15.969 --> 18:17.137
[Daniel] Look at that line.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.890
You'd think he's
giving away Teslas or something.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.935
Picked a good location too.
Lots of foot traffic.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.269
Welcome to Cobra Kai.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.938
This is what I was afraid of.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.899
Cobra Kai's enlisting kids who have
no idea what they're getting into.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.580
What? What is it?

18:43.664 --> 18:46.166
I have seen these moves before.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.168
[Daniel] You have? Where?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.796
Kim Sun-Yung.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.007
Excuse me. My name is Terry Silver.

18:54.800 --> 18:59.138
My master is Kim Sun-Yung of South Korea.
My teacher sends his respects.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.723
Wait. That's a real person?

19:02.558 --> 19:05.269
I thought it was just mumbo-jumbo
Silver came up with.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.604
No. He's very real.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.441
My uncle Sato did not speak much
of Kim Sun-Yung,

19:12.025 --> 19:14.111
but I know he had much anger towards him.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.487
Sounds like Sato.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.115
I don't think I ever remember
Mr. Miyagi mentioning Kim Sun-Yung.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.160
Well, Miyagi-san left Okinawa
before World War II.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.912
Kim Sun-Yung became known
during Korean War.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.582
He taught many American soldiers.

19:26.665 --> 19:30.919
Makes sense. Kreese and Silver
are war buddies. What did he teach them?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.006
Uh, Kim Sun-Yung
was a master of Tang Soo Do,

19:34.590 --> 19:36.341
but that is not what he taught.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.053
His style was, um, controversial.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.680
What was controversial about it?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.391
I will demonstrate.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.112
[clears throat]

19:57.863 --> 20:00.365
Kim Sun-Yung's style
is based on deception.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.743
No honor. No mercy.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.328
You could've just told me.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.540
If Silver is student of Master Kim,
we must be careful.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.211
All direct attacks will be recognized.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.839
I don't want to attack him.
I want to expose him.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.802
To catch serpent,
you must think like serpent.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.556
We will use his style against him.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.600
How will we do that?

in a few hours.

he saw Miguel talking to these surfers.

Slight build, but we're working on that.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.864
-Seen him?
-I gave him directions, yeah.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.866
Great. Can you tell me which way he went?

22:48.992 --> 22:50.452
Might be easier if I show ya.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.412
Got a map.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.041
Here we go. So…

22:56.124 --> 22:57.000
Turn around.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.086

23:12.432 --> 23:13.517
No, the address is real.

I'm gonna end up with it either way,

It was nothing.
I was here at the right time.

-It's… It's nice to meet you too.
-[Hector chuckles]

25:48.880 --> 25:49.714
Oh.

25:51.841 --> 25:52.801
This is strange.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.930
I feel like,
uh, we've met somewhere before.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.393
[chuckles] I don't think we have.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.519
[Hector laughs]

26:02.602 --> 26:06.815
Well, maybe you're a stranger,
but tonight, you're family. Okay?

26:07.816 --> 26:10.318
-Okay. All right.
-Okay. Vamos. Come on.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.486
[Miguel] Vamos. Okay.

26:12.028 --> 26:12.862
Thanks again.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.990
[Miguel] Of course, of course.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.075
[hopeful music plays]

26:25.250 --> 26:27.043
This trip was a disaster from jump.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.630
You're right.
It was a mistake to bring you.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.548
No, it wasn't.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.551
Okay, I mean, some of it was.

26:35.594 --> 26:39.014
Technically, you kidnapped
and transported a minor across the border.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.392
But we got a good story out of it.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
Yeah, we did.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.150
Your bus'll be here soon. You should go.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.737
This is my mess to clean up.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.281
You're right. But…

26:59.034 --> 26:59.993
But I'm gonna stay.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.411
[hopeful music plays]

27:01.494 --> 27:03.496
You're trying to make things right.
I wanna help you.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.668
At least now we know where we're going.
X marks the spot, right?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.255
-All right.
-[both laugh]

27:12.839 --> 27:13.798
[Johnny] All right.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.888
[Silver] Today is a turning point
at Cobra Kai.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.182
[sinister music plays]

27:22.265 --> 27:24.434
[Silver] Our competition
has closed up shop…

27:26.853 --> 27:29.189
and the Valley now looks to us
to lead the way.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.274
[sinister music continues]

27:32.400 --> 27:33.943
[Silver] We have a long road ahead.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.156
This is just the beginning.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.414
Right now, we're strangers.

27:47.040 --> 27:47.999
[laughter]

27:48.792 --> 27:51.878
[Silver] But I can tell you,
we won't be strangers for long.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.508
This is the start of something special.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.593
[sinister music continues]

27:59.552 --> 28:00.720
[Silver] For everyone else,

28:02.055 --> 28:03.390
it's summer vacation.

28:07.018 --> 28:07.894
But for us,

28:08.812 --> 28:10.438
the real work is about to begin.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.524
[sinister music continues]

28:13.066 --> 28:15.902
Cobra Kai now has more students
than ever before.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.657
That means we'll need more senseis.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.993
I'm gonna ask you
to do more than what's expected.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.037
[tense music plays]

28:26.121 --> 28:30.542
Which means I'm going to pay
more than what's expected.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.253
But first,

28:34.587 --> 28:36.923
you must prove yourself
in the way of the fist.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.134
[tense music continues]

28:42.387 --> 28:44.097
It's time to see if you're worthy.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.598
[man] Hai!

28:48.059 --> 28:49.352
Welcome to Cobra Kai.

28:49.436 --> 28:53.231
[tense music crescendos]

28:57.610 --> 29:00.196
