This movie deals with sensitive issues,
including domestic violence and suicide.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.280
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.880
12-06
HIM OR YOU - ONE OF YOU WILL DIE

01:03.680 --> 01:07.400
KNOWING THE DATE OF YOUR DEATH

01:07.480 --> 01:10.880
MEANS YOU ALREADY HAVE STARTED DYING.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.039
Emergency service, how can I help you?

01:13.120 --> 01:17.200
Hello, this is Anna on Prenzlauer Allee,
and there has been an emergency.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.039
And I think somebody died.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.440
It's dark. I don't feel safe.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.000
-Come quickly. There are injured people.
-Help is on the way. Please stay calm.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.000
According to the police,
the Calendar Killer writes

01:29.080 --> 01:31.200
his victim's date of death
in blood on the wall.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.560
-Accident location?
-A person is unconscious.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.160
-Blood everywhere!
-I need help!

01:37.240 --> 01:38.080
Come quickly!

01:38.160 --> 01:40.160
I think I am being followed.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.080
THE CALENDAR KILLER

01:48.160 --> 01:51.600
Walk Me Home Helpline, good evening.
How may I help you?

01:52.840 --> 01:53.720
Yes.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.400
But this is the Walk Me Home Helpline.

01:56.479 --> 01:59.320
We stay on the phone with people
as they walk home.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.560
Between 8:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

02:01.640 --> 02:05.200
For your issue, you need to call 115,
the Citizens' Services Helpline.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.800
But there won't be anyone right now.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.160
Right.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.720
Call them tomorrow morning.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.680
They'll be able to tell you
how to proceed with your complaint.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.160
Thank you for the nice chat, too.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.640
Walk Me Home Helpline, good evening.
How may I help you?

02:55.720 --> 02:57.480
Hi, this is Caro.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.520
Hello, Caro.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.440
I'm at the bus stop at Mexikoplatz and...

03:02.520 --> 03:04.960
There are some guys across the street.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.720
They keep staring.
I'm scared they're going to come over.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.000
Are you waiting for the bus?

03:09.080 --> 03:12.320
Yeah, for the 109.
It should be here by now.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.120
Okay, Caro.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.120
How many guys are there? How old?

03:17.920 --> 03:18.840
Five.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.079
I have no idea how old they are.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.680
Young. They're all wearing hoodies.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.240
Okay. Don't show them your fear.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.480
Stand under a streetlight,
so you're well-lit.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.720
-They're coming over. What do I do?
-Stay calm.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.800
-Are there any parked cars there?
-Yes.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.480
-Go over there and hit the hood.
-Why?

03:38.560 --> 03:39.680
Just do it.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.760
-What are you doing?
-Stupid bitch.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.240
Okay. They ran off.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.079
Well done.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.880
-Here comes my bus.
-Very good.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.560
Stay on the line
until you're on the bus, okay?

03:55.640 --> 03:56.720
Okay.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.800
Are you safe?

03:59.560 --> 04:00.400
Yes.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
Thank you.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.800
Well, have a nice evening.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.520
Have a nice evening.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.040
In the darkest depths of the oceans
where the game of predator and prey...

05:16.120 --> 05:18.320
I think nowadays
you cannot believe anyone anymore.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.080
Then say it. What do you think?

05:20.160 --> 05:24.280
The date of the victim's death was written
on the wall in blood each time.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.640
This is the modus operandi to which
the murderer now owes his name,

05:28.720 --> 05:29.960
Calendar Killer.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.440
So far, this handwriting
is the only lead to the murderer.

05:33.520 --> 05:38.800
Pay attention to the particular squiggle
at the end of the number "2."

05:38.880 --> 05:41.920
Do you recognize this handwriting?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Have you ever seen it--

06:05.120 --> 06:08.080
DAD
INCOMING CALL

06:56.680 --> 06:57.520
Good evening.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.520
Walk Me Home Helpline. How may I help you?

07:06.520 --> 07:09.520
This is the Walk Me Home Helpline.
You just called us.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.520
How can I help you?

07:15.080 --> 07:18.920
As you're not answering, I'll ask...
Are you being harassed or threatened?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.160
Cough if you're being threatened.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.159
-Hello?
-Who's there?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.240
-The Walk Me Home Helpline.
-Why did you call me?

07:37.880 --> 07:40.600
That's not possible.
I don't know who you are.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.800
-I don't have your number until now.
-Then it was probably my phone.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.159
Would you rather speak
to a female colleague?

07:47.240 --> 07:48.840
I can connect you right away.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.000
No. There's no need.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.000
Don't hang up, please.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.200
I can hear that you're in trouble.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.560
-Are you injured?
-It's too late.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.680
What happened? How can I help you?

08:04.760 --> 08:05.880
It's too late.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.040
Too late? Why?

08:09.320 --> 08:11.360
I'm going to be killed tonight.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.360
Killed?

08:16.400 --> 08:19.600
-Why do you think that?
-He announced it.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.400
May I ask your name?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.000
My name is Jules. Jules Tannberg.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
Klara...

08:30.160 --> 08:31.520
Klara Vernet.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.200
All right, Klara.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.919
Who wants to kill you?

08:42.039 --> 08:43.240
I'm very tired.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.760
Nobody will believe me anyway.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.760
Yes, I believe you.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.800
Talking to you is pointless. I'm sorry.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.800
It's too late.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.120
It's too late.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.480
Do you know who wants to kill you?

09:10.240 --> 09:11.480
Yes.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.880
Who?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.400
The Calendar Killer.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.080
You don't believe me, do you?

09:22.640 --> 09:23.640
I do.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.960
Of course, I do.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.080
What makes you think it's him?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.840
He wrote it on the wall...

09:33.680 --> 09:35.200
with a photo of me and my husband.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.680
Underneath, it said...

09:36.760 --> 09:40.720
12-06. One of you will die. Him or you.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.400
DECEMBER 6
21:31

09:43.480 --> 09:46.560
12-06
HIM OR YOU - ONE OF YOU WILL DIE

10:22.280 --> 10:23.400
3 KOSER STREET

10:23.480 --> 10:26.120
27 RENATA STREET

10:38.360 --> 10:40.160
I don't see any other option than...

10:40.280 --> 10:43.360
Klara, if you're being threatened,
you have to tell the police.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.720
I already did. But they didn't believe me.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.360
...that I woke up in a basement
with a death threat on the wall...

10:50.440 --> 10:51.720
I couldn't prove anything.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.120
When was that?

10:56.200 --> 10:57.280
A few weeks ago.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.680
I can't remember properly.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.440
I woke up in a park

11:02.520 --> 11:04.040
and went straight home.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.080
-Are you at home now?
-No.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.200
Why not?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.040
Are you scared that the killer is there?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.400
What about your husband?

11:15.480 --> 11:17.840
-He won't help me.
-Why not?

11:19.040 --> 11:21.440
Because he thinks I imagined it all.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.520
That's also what he told the police.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.320
He was so embarrassed
and I was very ashamed.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.480
But no one makes up something like that.
Isn't your husband worried?

11:30.560 --> 11:31.840
He's being threatened, too.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.440
He just laughed at me.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.680
It's nothing to laugh about.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.280
NO STREET NOISE
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD

11:50.040 --> 11:51.600
Where are you now, Klara?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.200
I shouldn't have told you any of this.
I'm sorry. I...

11:57.440 --> 11:59.280
But at least I've made it this far.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.320
What do you mean "this far"?

12:05.240 --> 12:06.760
Are you in a garage?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.240
Are you driving away?

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
Klara?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.240
What are you going to do?

12:18.920 --> 12:20.080
What are you up to?

12:39.560 --> 12:40.760
Please wait a moment.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.880
Stay on the line for a moment.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.400
Klara...

12:59.240 --> 13:02.800
-Don't do anything hasty, please.
-I'm not. Why do you think that?

13:03.520 --> 13:07.000
I worked at the Berlin Fire Department's
call center for many years.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.960
I know how it sounds
when someone is in major distress.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.400
You've called us three times already...

13:17.680 --> 13:19.840
but not because of the Calendar Killer.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.520
-Why did you call then?
-I was scared to walk home in the dark.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.720
Isn't that what this service is for?

13:25.800 --> 13:26.800
Yes, of course.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.160
Forgive me.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.560
VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
CREDIBLE?

13:34.640 --> 13:36.200
May I ask you a question?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.760
What?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.200
Is everything okay at home?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.480
Yes, absolutely.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.840
Where's your husband now?

13:50.760 --> 13:54.360
-Why are you walking alone at night?
-Why are you asking all these questions?

13:54.440 --> 13:57.960
Because in our notes, it says
there's a suspicion of domestic violence.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.160
-These conversations are recorded?
-Yes, why?

14:02.240 --> 14:06.720
So everything I tell you is documented?

14:06.800 --> 14:10.160
Yes, but only for 48 hours.
And it's covered by data protection.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.640
-Why?
-So...

14:12.640 --> 14:14.600
So if something were
to happen to me tonight,

14:14.680 --> 14:17.200
then the police would find out
about this conversation?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.400
What are you getting at?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.920
A killer is after you.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.360
And you won't go to the police
or home to your husband. Why?

15:18.520 --> 15:20.800
27 RENATA STREET

15:26.920 --> 15:28.400
You don't believe me either.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.760
Are you being abused?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.200
Yes.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.200
I am sorry.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.680
You're afraid.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.040
It's even worse than that.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.640
It's the kind of fear...

16:08.080 --> 16:10.440
that makes you want to tear your skin off,

16:10.520 --> 16:12.600
so that you'll stop
from burning up inside.

16:18.120 --> 16:22.240
Hell's most evil trick is
to disguise itself as paradise.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.000
Good evening.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.880
Thank you.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.280
Good evening, Mr. Gerrich.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.200
Oh, the von Bülows.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.360
They made a big donation
to the election campaign. Nice people.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.800
Thank you for dressing
the way I've asked you to, Klara.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.400
You look fantastic.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
My pleasure.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.720
Klara.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.000
My goodness.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.440
How are you? We never see you anymore.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.000
Wow.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.760
-Martin, congratulations on the new job.
-Thank you.

17:21.839 --> 17:25.480
-How's the air up there?
-Quite thin.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.160
But it can blow right in your face
if you're not careful.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.880
-You look fantastic, Meret.
-Thank you.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.480
May I introduce you?
Dr. Paul Wassmann, our new associate.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.320
-Nice to meet you.
-This is Dr. Martin Vernet.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.560
Our State Secretary of the Interior
for three weeks now.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.720
And this is my traitorous friend, Klara,
one of the best lawyers at our firm,

17:46.800 --> 17:49.440
until she discovered life
as a full-time mom.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.240
-Don't you miss work just a little?
-I do sometimes.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.720
I really hope you'll come back to us.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.080
-Maybe when Amelie starts school--
-If Klara prefers to raise our daughter,

18:00.160 --> 18:01.840
then she should do it.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.080
I miss her.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.840
Let's go for coffee, at least.
And you can bring Amelie.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.480
I promise.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.840
-Martin.
-Enjoy your evening.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.400
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.680
Dear Lord, doesn't she ever stop?

18:23.760 --> 18:26.000
Be glad you don't have
to deal with her anymore.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.040
Actually, it's a shame
I don't see her anymore.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.200
But you have me and Amelie.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.480
That's true.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.200
So... let's celebrate our anniversary.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.080
-Evening.
-Thank you.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.240
Thank you.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.920
So here's to an exciting night.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.960
Enjoy your meal.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.160
I know you don't like seafood,

19:10.360 --> 19:12.560
but you need protein
for what's planned later.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.680
What do we have planned tonight?

19:49.240 --> 19:50.240
I am sorry.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.840
So sorry.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.160
Have you stopped taking your pills?

19:58.360 --> 19:59.520
Damn it, Klara.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.000
Do I need to have you admitted
to the clinic again?

20:03.080 --> 20:05.000
-Martin, I'm fine.
-I'm warning you.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.120
I won't let Amelie have
a mentally deranged mother.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.520
-I can't stomach the pills.
-The doctor can prescribe something else.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.160
-Forgive me.
-So...

20:20.480 --> 20:21.560
Time to eat.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.280
How long is the babysitter staying?

20:47.200 --> 20:48.920
Vigo will stay until we get home.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.240
Give me your phone.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.760
Welcome to our VP Night.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.600
I'm here for you,
whatever you might desire.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.240
What's a VP Night?

22:31.640 --> 22:32.960
Very exclusive.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.520
Martin, please. I'd like to go.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.840
You haven't even finished your drink.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.320
What's the matter? These women are
being paid very well for their services.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.760
The entrance fee is donated
to the Children's Foundation.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.920
It's a good thing.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.200
Martin, please.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.280
It's for a good cause.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.760
He must have put something
in the champagne.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.800
That's horrible.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.960
I only regained consciousness
because of the pain.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.600
Martin, please...

24:46.240 --> 24:48.680
Klara, you must leave your husband.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.080
Yes.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.080
I should have done it
a long time ago. It's just...

24:54.600 --> 24:57.320
I don't want Amelie to find out
what he's done to me.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.680
That's understandable.
You didn't want to hurt her...

25:02.960 --> 25:05.680
-How old is your daughter?
-Amelie is six.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.240
I have a daughter, too.
Her name is Fabienne.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.880
She's six, too.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.200
-Where is your daughter now?
-She's asleep.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.560
And who's looking after her? Is she alone?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.040
Of course not.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.320
We've got a babysitter.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.040
Can you believe that he's a good father?

25:26.280 --> 25:28.000
It's hard to believe, but it's true.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.720
Amelie loves him.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.320
I have to go, now, before he finds me.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.360
Where are you?

25:39.160 --> 25:40.960
You are closing a garage door.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.080
You opened a car door.
What are you planning?

25:45.160 --> 25:47.520
For what I'm planning to do,
it's better if I'm alone.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.480
No.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.200
No, don't do that.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.440
Please don't do it.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.880
Don't tell me what to do.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.520
I'm sorry.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.480
I'm so sorry, but you cannot do this.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.360
Don't do this! Don't do this, please!

26:04.920 --> 26:06.040
I am begging you.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.360
Klara! Klara, please!

26:08.440 --> 26:10.640
MARTIN - I always know where you are!
Brace yourself!

26:10.720 --> 26:13.920
Either the Calendar Killer
or Martin will kill me.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.560
So I'd rather do it myself.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.000
If you do this...

26:21.000 --> 26:22.720
Amelie will never get over it.

26:22.800 --> 26:23.640
Believe me.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.840
I can hear that you're not driving.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.320
I am begging you. Please stop.
We'll find a way.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.240
Klara?

26:39.080 --> 26:40.760
Hello? Klara, please.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.360
Enough!

27:13.440 --> 27:15.200
I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.360
I don't want to have
to take her to the ER.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.240
You did well, darling.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.720
Let's take a little break, okay?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.640
Please take care of my wife.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.480
Come. I'll show you to our powder room.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.080
I'll go get you a stronger painkiller.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.320
Did your wife enjoy it?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.800
You never forget the first time.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.040
Excuse me, please.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.440
-Where's my wife?
-She must still be in the powder room.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.640
Yo, this is Vigo. Feel free to leave
a message after the beep.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.720
Hi, Vigo.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.640
This message is for Amelie.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.800
Hi, sweetie.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.320
Mommy!

30:04.400 --> 30:06.560
I just wanted to tell you
how much I love you.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.120
It wasn't your fault, you hear me?

30:16.040 --> 30:17.400
I love you so much.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.000
CALLING

30:35.560 --> 30:37.320
DAD
INCOMING CALL

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
I have no time right now. Call tomorrow.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.000
How come? What's wrong?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.560
-An emergency.
-An emergency?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.400
I thought you were still on leave?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.920
-I'm not at the emergency switchboard.
-So where are you?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.640
Walk Me Home Helpline. Voluntary.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.880
There's a woman who wants to kill herself.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.120
Then call the police.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.560
I don't know where she is.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.920
-Maybe I can help you?
-That would be a first.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.600
Tell me her name,
and I'll find out where she is.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.080
No, I'm not allowed to.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.040
Jules, you're talking to a woman
who wants to kill herself.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.960
I can imagine what that's doing to you.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.480
-You can?
-Yes. I can.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.640
You want to save her,

31:19.720 --> 31:22.400
-after the incident with Dajana--
-Stop it!

31:24.280 --> 31:26.680
-Where are you?
-At home. Where else?

32:00.600 --> 32:01.560
What?

32:01.640 --> 32:04.240
Jules, I want to help you. Damn it.
I'm your father.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.760
-Congrats on that realization.
-Tell me what you know.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.360
So, what's her name?

32:12.880 --> 32:14.600
All right. It's up to you.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.040
-If it all goes wrong and you haven't--
-Her name is Klara.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.360
-Klara... Klara what?
-Vernet.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.360
That's it?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.440
She was at the Le Zen Hotel today.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.960
There must be
some secret pervert club there.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.880
That's news to me.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.280
But I'll ask around.
I still know someone there.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.040
Stay out of everything else, okay?

33:56.480 --> 33:58.960
Further snow showers
are expected in Berlin tonight.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.480
So please drive carefully,
or make yourself comfortable at home.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.520
It's 10:03 p.m.
The next news will be at 11:00 p.m.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.679
Thank God. How are you feeling?

34:20.760 --> 34:21.800
Shitty.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.040
I feel sick. I threw up.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.400
I can't go on. I am so tired.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.960
Where are you now?

34:30.040 --> 34:32.239
Where the Calendar Killer
will never find me...

34:32.679 --> 34:34.520
Why is this so important to you?

34:34.600 --> 34:36.800
Why can't you just leave me alone?

34:37.760 --> 34:40.280
I'm sure you can't imagine it, but...

34:42.040 --> 34:44.080
I know exactly what you're going through.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.880
I've been on the phone
with women like you for a long time.

34:47.960 --> 34:52.120
Women who were crying because their men
had beaten them half to death.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.880
And were you able to help them?

34:56.520 --> 34:57.720
I tried.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.200
Over and over again.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.040
But as soon as the police arrived,

35:03.040 --> 35:06.240
suddenly everything was only half as bad,
and the men got away with it.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.720
I don't understand it.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.680
Why do women put up with it?

35:12.720 --> 35:14.640
Because they're financially dependent.

35:16.760 --> 35:19.000
Or they don't want
to take the kids from their dad.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.120
Because they're ashamed.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.200
Because they don't know where to go.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.480
Or they think
they're to blame for the beatings.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.280
Because they're terrified it'll only
get worse, and they'll be killed.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.080
Or the husband has some hold
over the woman and is blackmailing her.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.440
Klara, put an end to this misery,
but don't end your life.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.160
Why is it so important to you?
You don't know me at all.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.240
I told you about my daughter. Fabienne?

35:55.480 --> 35:56.520
Yes.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.080
Her mother killed herself.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.680
Ever since that,
Fabienne hasn't been doing--

36:02.760 --> 36:04.280
Why are you telling me all this?

36:05.120 --> 36:06.680
To make me feel guilty?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.440
No.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.440
Her mother was in a clinic.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.680
At first, it seemed things would be okay.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.160
The doctors at Berger Hof...

36:19.240 --> 36:21.520
-That was the clinic she was in.
-Berger Hof?

36:22.040 --> 36:24.640
-I was there, too.
-What? What for?

36:26.280 --> 36:27.840
Dissociative disorders.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.920
Sometimes, I see things that aren't there.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
-Were they able to help you?
-Yes, they did.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.200
But I have to take medication.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.240
And Martin threatens to have me
admitted again for every little thing.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.360
Dajana suffered from severe depression.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.920
I had hoped that they would
be able to help her, but...

36:56.920 --> 36:58.480
It was too late.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.560
You're not the only one
who's been through hell.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.360
Mommy! Please open the door!

37:18.440 --> 37:19.640
Mommy! It's on fire!

37:20.320 --> 37:21.840
Mommy!

37:21.920 --> 37:24.560
Mommy!

37:26.280 --> 37:27.280
Mommy!

37:28.040 --> 37:29.520
We can't get out!

37:36.520 --> 37:39.000
Hurry, there's a fire,
and I hear someone screaming.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.160
It's a child.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.520
The firefighters will be there
in under two minutes.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.160
Do not open the door!

37:44.240 --> 37:46.720
It could cause a back draft,
and you'll be in flames.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.880
-Please leave the building.
-But what about the kid? The screams...

37:49.960 --> 37:52.600
My colleagues will take care of it.
Please get out of there.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.720
Just a moment.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.520
-Yes?
-Incident command vehicle 26. Stelling.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.680
Tannberg, what's going on?
There's nothing here.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.440
-What do you mean?
-There's no fire anywhere here.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.360
Okay.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.080
-Mr. Damelow?
-Yes? Where are you?

38:04.160 --> 38:06.000
There's no fire
in Brandenburgische Street.

38:06.080 --> 38:06.960
What?

38:07.040 --> 38:08.680
-That prank will be expensive.
-Oh, God.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.120
I was in a panic,
and I gave you the wrong address.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.600
-Where are you?
-I am so sorry.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.240
I'm at 24 Prince Regent Street.
Third floor.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.400
-Please repeat that.
-24 Prince Regent Street. Hello?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.600
Let me through! Damn it!

38:44.360 --> 38:45.640
What happened?

39:22.440 --> 39:24.680
Dajana locked up the kids in their rooms.

39:26.160 --> 39:29.640
She wanted to spare them the sight
of their dead mother in the bathtub.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.920
My little ones
tried desperately to get out.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.120
Fabienne managed to hide in the closet.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.480
She was taken to the hospital.

39:46.880 --> 39:51.120
My son was probably playing
with a leftover birthday candle.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.400
She must have noticed the smoke.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.400
But it was too late.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.880
She wanted to unlock the door.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.880
But she had no strength left.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.840
I am sorry.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.520
Look at me.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.800
Just a moment. I need to check something.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.000
Stay on the line.

40:57.880 --> 40:58.720
Turn around!

41:00.240 --> 41:01.520
Come over here.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.480
Show your face.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.280
Klara!

41:11.280 --> 41:14.640
12-06
HIM OR YOU

41:15.280 --> 41:16.880
Look at me. Look at me.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.920
Now... turn around.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.040
Show me your face.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.400
Klara! Look at me!

41:59.680 --> 42:02.320
Look at me! Look at me!

42:02.400 --> 42:03.960
Turn around.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.520
Now show me your face.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.600
Klara!

42:19.680 --> 42:21.120
Look at me!

42:24.040 --> 42:25.000
Mommy?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.520
Klara, I'm back.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.560
Jules... he was here.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.440
-He was here.
-Who?

43:58.880 --> 44:01.240
The Calendar Killer.
He was here in the cabin.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.680
Listen. This is what we'll do.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.480
I'll send a cab to take you straight home.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.680
Give me the address.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.280
I'd rather take my car.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.640
No, wait.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.520
I'll send you something.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.640
12-06
HIM OR YOU

44:37.520 --> 44:38.960
Now they'll have to believe me.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.720
The police and Martin.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.440
He said it was
just another one of my delusions.

44:56.560 --> 45:00.400
He asked how anyone would know
when I was in the parking garage.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.960
Martin wanted to have me
readmitted to Berger Hof.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.080
He has left you completely alone
with your fear.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.440
The more I think about it...

45:15.080 --> 45:16.560
the more I believe...

45:19.280 --> 45:21.080
I believe that Martin's behind it all.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.760
Why?

45:28.600 --> 45:30.960
He's the only one
who always knows where I am.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.320
He knows the cabin.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.800
He's got the videos.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.080
He's using my illness against me.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.120
And on December 6...

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
We got married on December 6.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.560
Please drive home right away
and get your child.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.200
We'll meet in front of your apartment.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.800
I'll help you.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.560
You don't know him.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.080
He always wins.

46:04.840 --> 46:05.920
Not this time.

46:12.920 --> 46:13.960
Jules.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.880
He's here.

46:23.600 --> 46:24.800
Klara, is someone there?

46:25.920 --> 46:27.760
Klara, tell me what's happening?

46:38.080 --> 46:40.080
Klara, is there someone in your house?

46:53.760 --> 46:55.880
Can you hear me? Is someone there?

46:55.960 --> 46:58.040
Can you hear me? Klara, please...

47:08.800 --> 47:10.360
DECEMBER 6

49:27.920 --> 49:30.200
-What?
-Is the woman still on the line?

49:31.200 --> 49:32.280
Where are you?

49:33.640 --> 49:36.640
I'm standing here in front of Le Zen.

49:36.720 --> 49:37.880
And you?

49:37.960 --> 49:41.080
-Did you find out anything?
-The manager was beside himself.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.080
Obviously, he's going to deny it.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.120
He would have told me. Trust me.

49:48.120 --> 49:52.000
-Did you really look everywhere?
-Yes, there's nothing there.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.240
Jules, do you hear me?
The woman lied to you.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.840
Why should I believe you more than her?

50:02.920 --> 50:05.480
-Given all the times you lied to Mom--
-The woman is lying.

50:06.280 --> 50:10.200
And I swear to you.
Her suicide story doesn't add up.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.200
NETWORK NOT AVAILABLE

50:47.960 --> 50:48.920
Klara!

51:04.960 --> 51:08.960
This is Klara Vernet's voicemail.
Please leave a message after the beep.

51:09.720 --> 51:13.720
Klara, please call me back.
Please. I'm begging you.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.360
Hey!

52:08.480 --> 52:10.600
Calm down. Just calm down.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.600
Hey, calm down.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.040
Hey, calm down!

52:14.120 --> 52:15.320
I won't hurt you.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.000
Come on. I'll help you.

52:21.440 --> 52:22.840
I'm Hendrik.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.000
Come on. I'll help you.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.440
Come on.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.160
Come. It's alright.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.040
Klara!

54:53.400 --> 54:54.440
It's Hendrik, right?

54:55.760 --> 54:59.000
Just let me out somewhere
when we get to the city.

54:59.720 --> 55:01.320
It looks like you need a doctor.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.160
I'll get you to the next ER.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.520
It's nice that you're concerned.
But I'm fine.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.000
Just let me out anywhere in the city.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.360
NO NETWORK

55:34.600 --> 55:38.520
How come you're driving around
at night in a Santa costume?

55:39.240 --> 55:40.480
Bachelor's party.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.320
I'm a stripper.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.200
You should see my underpants.

55:46.680 --> 55:49.840
Red with a white pom-pom
in front of the family jewels.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.440
What? It pays the rent.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.360
WALK ME HOME HELPLINE
3 MISSED CALLS

55:58.240 --> 55:59.720
INCOMING CALL

56:01.960 --> 56:04.200
Klara! Are you all right? What happened?

56:04.280 --> 56:05.280
I saw him.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.840
The Calendar Killer was in our cabin.

56:08.640 --> 56:09.720
But I made it out.

56:09.800 --> 56:13.000
-Where are you now?
-On my way to the city. I got a ride.

56:13.080 --> 56:15.000
-Who with?
-Santa Claus.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.560
-Excuse me?
-Don't worry about it.

56:19.160 --> 56:23.240
Listen. Martin must be on his way home.
I have to get to Amelie before him.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.840
Please be careful.

56:26.040 --> 56:28.600
You shouldn't trust anyone tonight.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.440
Daddy!

56:32.520 --> 56:34.840
Please stay on the line.
I need to check on my daughter.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.520
Mommy.

56:38.120 --> 56:38.960
Daddy.

56:40.040 --> 56:41.360
Is everything okay?

56:41.480 --> 56:43.160
No. No, she is burning up.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.800
I need to check if there's
any liquid fever medication left.

56:58.440 --> 56:59.800
Mommy.

57:02.440 --> 57:04.000
Mommy.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.640
Daddy.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.640
Mommy.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.240
Can you sing?

57:42.520 --> 57:44.120
-What?
-Sing?

57:46.800 --> 57:47.840
Well...

57:50.800 --> 57:53.560
Put the phone next to Fabienne's ear.

58:00.400 --> 58:05.160
Behold, the moon has risen

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
The golden stars, they glisten

58:12.920 --> 58:17.080
Upon the heavens bright

58:18.320 --> 58:23.480
The forests rest in shadows

58:24.880 --> 58:30.160
And from the quiet meadows

58:31.240 --> 58:36.400
White haze rises into the night

58:44.680 --> 58:46.880
Dajana used to
always sing that to Fabienne.

58:51.560 --> 58:52.960
Is she calmer now?

58:56.760 --> 58:57.880
Yes, she is.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.760
Thank you.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.520
I can't leave Amelie all alone.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.040
I have to be there for her.

59:13.360 --> 59:15.000
I mustn't destroy her life.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.920
I've let that happen to me
all these years.

59:22.120 --> 59:23.240
I loved Martin.

59:32.920 --> 59:34.240
But I can't do it anymore.

59:37.320 --> 59:39.200
I have to go home to my daughter...

59:40.080 --> 59:41.560
and finally leave Martin.

59:42.320 --> 59:43.920
I'll help you if you want.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.640
I can make sure you and Amelie are safe.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.760
Just tell me where you are and...

59:53.160 --> 59:55.680
-I'll come.
-You've already helped me enough.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.600
I have to do this alone.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.600
And with the photo,
I have proof that the Calendar...

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.760
That I didn't just imagine it all.
Now they have to believe me.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.040
Just another hour
and December 6 will be over.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.840
My offer still stands.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.360
Thank you, Jules.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.880
My pleasure, Klara.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.280
What was that all about?

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.760
The Calendar Killer is after you?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.560
Can I get one of those?

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.120
Sure.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.680
Another pack should be
in the box back there.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.080
My first one in 15 years.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.520
Do you have a light?

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.680
Where is it?

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.360
-Stop the car. Right now!
-Hey, calm down.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.040
I always have the taser with me.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.920
-Calm down!
-Open the door!

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.120
-Take it easy!
-Open!

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.640
I won't hurt you.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.880
Okay?

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.520
Everything is fine. Really.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.000
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.400
Hey, what...

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.040
Martin!

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.400
Stop it!

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.040
It wasn't nice of you to take off earlier.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.200
Get in!

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.200
-We can't just leave him. He'll freeze!
-Get in. Now!

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.240
Let go!

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.200
I'm so sorry.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.920
I'm so sorry.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.000
You must have known I'd find you.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.840
Who was that?

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.920
I saw footprints in front of the house.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.880
Didn't you go into the bedroom?

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.400
The bedroom?

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320
What's that?

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.160
A death threat from the Calendar Killer.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.160
The Calendar Killer?

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.960
Klara, don't start with all that again.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.160
I'll drive back there tomorrow.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.360
If it's really written there,
I'll call the police.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.520
But if you're just making it up again,
I'll take you back to Berger Hof.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.720
I was in the garage. I saw the tube.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.120
Don't ever do that again.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.000
What are you doing?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.240
I'm checking if Vigo texted me.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.520
I was thinking about us.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.680
Last year, after I took you
to the ER in Potsdam...

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.320
When we went back home
and I cooked for you,

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.240
you asked me for the thousandth time
why I don't get therapy.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.920
The truth is, I started therapy.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.560
But the guy just reeled off
the usual spiel.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.680
How I lacked confidence

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.560
because I had an abusive father
and a mother who ran away.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.160
I don't need a therapist for that.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.080
You see?

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.840
I have no problem saying it.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.440
If there was a self-help group like the AA
where you had to introduce yourself,

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.360
I'd do it.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.560
I'd stand up and say,

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.800
"Hello. My name is Martin.
I'm 44 and I beat my wife."

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.840
And that's supposed to justify everything?

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.280
You need to stop provoking me, Klara.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.120
Provoking you?

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.640
-I'm provoking you?
-Yes.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.280
How?

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.880
Why didn't you leave a long time ago?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.600
You just put up with it.
The beatings, the shouting.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.400
You let it all happen, Klara.
Every punch, every kick.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.400
Let it happen?

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.240
I let you...

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.400
drag me to that perverted club?

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.280
Let you offer me up...

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.360
to be whipped like a piece of meat?

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.640
-Are you serious?
-I didn't say that.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.520
But you make me angry so often,
just by being there.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.520
How can I respect you
if you don't even respect yourself?

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.160
You scare the shit out of me
every day, Martin.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.840
I know.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.680
And I'm sorry about that.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.400
Do you believe me?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.000
Do you believe that I love you?

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.000
I'll tell you something.
You won't leave me!

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.920
Do you understand me?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.040
Drive me home.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.000
I want to be with my daughter.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.040
I can help you.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280
So...

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.480
brace yourself for what's coming.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.320
You won't touch me in front of Amelie.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.800
Don't tell me what to do.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.680
Never touch me again.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.480
Klara!

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.760
Klara!

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.280
Vigo?

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.280
Vigo?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.880
Behold, the moon has risen

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.040
The golden stars, they glisten

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.320
Upon the heavens bright

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880
Amelie?

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.920
The forests rest in shadows

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.800
And from the quiet meadows

01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:00.520
White haze rises into the night

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.240
Hello, Klara.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.440
Jules?

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.080
What's wrong with Amelie?

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.680
Don't worry. She's fine.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.280
Just a sleeping pill.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:23.840
Where's Martin?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.760
Where's Vigo?

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.480
Let's leave her bedroom.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.480
Or she'll wake up.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.000
Jules, why are you here?

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.000
Let her sleep.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.720
12-06
HIM OR YOU

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.320
Please don't.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.080
It's time.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.000
Where's your husband?

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.240
Please.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.360
Let me show you something.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.000
I saw everything he did to you.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.520
There are cameras in every room.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.440
What I saw is unbearable.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.440
Drop it.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.400
Don't make it so difficult.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.560
Ten minutes left.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.440
Now it's Klara or Martin.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.400
So, where is he?

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.440
Jules...

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.920
It's close to midnight.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.120
I told you I'm leaving Martin.
Why does he have to die?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.320
I just want to leave him
and take Amelie with me.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.560
Why do you still stand up for him?

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.480
You know he deserves it.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.960
Jules, stop this madness.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.000
The madness is what you let him do to you.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.520
Where is your husband?

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.960
Now it's your chance
to take back control of your life.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.560
It's him or you.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.560
Four more minutes.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.280
You have to kill him.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.200
Stay quiet.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.560
And Fabienne?

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.520
What happened to Fabienne?

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.720
Fabienne is dead. She didn't make it.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.720
She died in the hospital.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.120
You have to get
this bastard out of your life.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.800
And then?

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.600
What happens then?
You can't just let me go.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.760
Trust me.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.720
I have a plan.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.720
I'm on your side.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.440
It's 11.57 p.m.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.120
You will kill him.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.120
Or I will kill you.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.720
Three minutes.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.040
Take it.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.440
-I can't do it. Please.
-Come on.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.600
Jules, please.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.440
Think of everything he did to you.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.640
This man made your life a living hell!

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.640
Do you even realize
the chance I'm giving you?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920
Two minutes.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.920
Jules, please...

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.920
-What?
-Don't you...

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.640
Don't you understand?

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.120
Martin's death won't bring Dajana back.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.200
Well...

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.520
That's true.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.800
You're smart.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.320
So was Dajana.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.480
But what she went through as a child,
her father's abuse,

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.720
a mother who kept quiet
and looked the other way...

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:32.800
It broke her.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.080
And when she took her own life,
she took my children's lives with her.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.480
And she took mine, too.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.240
I do what I do to give women like you

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.040
the chance to fight back.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.080
One minute.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.040
You can do it.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.320
Think of Amelie.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280
She needs you.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.040
But not a father like him.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.200
I'm sorry.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.120
Okay, please...

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.960
Be still.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.880
How? Where?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.240
The carotid artery.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.840
Like this?

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.280
Yes.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.240
Forgive me.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.840
Klara!

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.360
You two deserve each other.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.000
He's my son.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.000
I'm sorry.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.320
I wanted to protect you from him.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.520
But I was too late.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.280
I was too late.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.560
I recognized his handwriting on TV.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.360
-How did he survive that?
-A nightmare.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.520
It must have been a nightmare.

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.760
Yes, you could say that.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.200
My wife and I were incredibly lucky.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.520
It was unimaginable.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.280
And our daughter is still so young.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.080
may I ask you to switch off your phones
and take your seats.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.280
We will now begin with the award
for outstanding achievements in service.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.600
I'm delighted to be representing

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.200
our Senator of the Interior, Dr. Herrmann,

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.920
who, as you know, is still recovering,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.680
in presenting
these special medals of honor

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.320
to ten of our service officers.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.640
Last year, we had...

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.520
Hello. My name is Martin.
I'm 44 and I beat my wife.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.640
You let it all happen, Klara.
Every punch, every kick.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.680
...drag me to that perverted club?

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760
Are you serious?

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.240
You won't leave me!

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.920
Do you understand me?

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.480
You see? I have no problem...

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.360
In view of the fact that we...

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.240
...you make me angry so often
just by being there.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.880
You just put up with it.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.840
Hello. My name is Martin. I'm...

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:35.960
What's going on?

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.040
...if you don't even respect yourself?

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.080
Mr. Vernet.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.720
We are taking you into custody.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.680
Criminal charges have been filed
against you for sexual assault,

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.720
serious bodily harm, coercion,
and insult on a sexual basis.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.640
I would ask you, in your own interest,
to follow us without causing a scene.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.720
What are you doing?

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.240
I'm checking if Vigo texted me.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:27.520
LATEST ISSUE
5 YEARS FOR MARTIN VERNET

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.360
This story is fictional.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.000
Nevertheless, intimate partner violence
is a cruel reality.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.920
In Germany, one in four women
experiences physical or sexual violence

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.080
in their relationship
at least once in their life.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.960
Women from all social classes
are affected.
