So, then, why did you let him
sneak around all that time?

Except they're more like still-deaths.

Yes.

None of the names match.

to Ramsey's birthday party?

23:15.228 --> 23:17.938
Oh, forget the party.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.023
Nah, you and me.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.650
Tomorrow night.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.485
No excuses.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.487
Pick you up after work.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.948
Where we going?

23:27.949 --> 23:30.033
You want me to say right here?

23:30.034 --> 23:32.661
In front of all these people?

23:32.662 --> 23:34.496
I...

23:34.497 --> 23:36.248
I kind of do.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.959
The way you're making it sound.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.963
Well, it's definitely going to feel

23:42.964 --> 23:45.216
even better than it sounds.

23:48.803 --> 23:52.514
[Sampson] You're right.
These quotes must matter to this freak.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.100
But they look random.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.186
Why are these ones red?

23:58.187 --> 24:00.147
A lot of the quotes are public record.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.941
Last words, statements to the press.
Like that.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.610
But there's no record of these red ones.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.363
De Lackner thinks
he made shit up to suit himself.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.073
You don't agree?

24:10.074 --> 24:13.034
One of my dumb-ass cousins
got to trading letters

24:13.035 --> 24:14.953
with a guy doing a nickel for GTA.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.122
Started saying shit like,

24:17.123 --> 24:19.082
"I love him, Amielynn."

24:19.083 --> 24:20.792
Jesus.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.045
So you think the Fanboy
corresponded with these freaks.

24:24.046 --> 24:27.257
[Vega] Well, not everyone has a cousin
to beat some sense into them.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.925
Fuck.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.219
What inspired this?

24:31.220 --> 24:35.308
[De Lackner] This sick motherfucker
has got to go away, ASAP.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.853
[Sampson] All right,
this is everything we have on Emir.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.564
Theme on Shannon.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.484
These two are the other victims.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.612
Couple of blanks here and there, but...

24:48.613 --> 24:51.490
[intriguing music playing]

24:56.495 --> 24:58.121
[Vega] Hey, did we ever figure out

24:58.122 --> 24:59.915
- the name of that--
- Shh.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.876
Doing his thing.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.385
He thinks...

25:12.386 --> 25:14.222
he's an artist.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.266
[keys jingling]

25:23.689 --> 25:26.317
<i>He wants to leave behind a masterwork.</i>

25:28.277 --> 25:30.487
<i>He wants to be adored.</i>

25:30.488 --> 25:34.867
Thank you all for accommodating
this schedule change.

25:35.910 --> 25:39.120
I ran into some
unforeseen circumstances, but

25:39.121 --> 25:41.831
<i>I've addressed them.</i>

25:41.832 --> 25:43.959
[Cross] It's the book.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.420
You know how some people think
a photo can take a part of their soul?

25:47.421 --> 25:49.756
<i>I think that's the book for him.</i>

25:49.757 --> 25:51.008
<i>A way to...</i>

25:52.343 --> 25:55.011
...capture their power for himself.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.221
[Ramsey] [muffled] <i>Everything</i>

25:56.222 --> 25:58.098

25:58.099 --> 26:00.767
I am going to finish on the day,

26:00.768 --> 26:03.562
and the time, as was always the plan.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.607
He won't kill forever.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.026
He has an ultimate moment

26:10.027 --> 26:12.529
he's been working towards for years.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.780
[Ramsey] <i>And I know</i>

26:13.781 --> 26:17.325
that you will all want to be there

26:17.326 --> 26:19.911
to witness the moment

26:19.912 --> 26:22.122
everything changes.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.290
[Cross] <i>And then...</i>

26:23.291 --> 26:26.711
...then he'll be complete.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.046
<i>More.</i>

26:30.047 --> 26:32.883
<i>Transformed.</i>

26:44.020 --> 26:47.063
We have to catch him
before he finishes Shannon.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.898
If we don't find him
before that book is done,

26:48.899 --> 26:50.776
we may never have another chance again.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.571
[Sampson] You wanted Dierdre Nolan?

26:54.572 --> 26:56.824
Ask and you shall receive.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.121
That's the psych eval video you asked for.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.206
Can't believe you found it.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.460
You know, amazing is what I do.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.628
When I'm not being perfect.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.757
You think she gave the stalker away
in the interview?

27:13.758 --> 27:15.675
I don't know.

27:15.676 --> 27:18.219
But this is the last thread I have
to follow with her.

27:18.220 --> 27:21.264

27:21.265 --> 27:22.974

27:22.975 --> 27:24.934
<i>I'm in jail, so...</i>

27:24.935 --> 27:27.354
<i>That's right.</i>

27:27.355 --> 27:28.938
<i>Do you know what you're in jail for?</i>

27:28.939 --> 27:31.107
[Deirdre] <i>Is this a game?</i>

27:31.108 --> 27:33.401
<i>You better be careful. I'm good at games.</i>

27:33.402 --> 27:36.112
<i>It's not a game.</i>

27:36.113 --> 27:37.697
<i>I killed Lance Marion.</i>

27:37.698 --> 27:39.199
[haunting music playing]

27:39.200 --> 27:41.409
<i>Why?</i>

27:41.410 --> 27:42.952
<i>Does it matter?</i>

27:42.953 --> 27:46.956
<i>It does to his friends and family.
They loved him.</i>

27:46.957 --> 27:49.877
<i>What, did they think
he was gonna live forever?</i>

27:53.464 --> 27:55.633
<i>Have you ever lost someone you love?</i>

27:58.844 --> 28:00.929
[Deirdre] <i>Yeah. I had a cat.</i>

28:00.930 --> 28:02.765
<i>She got hit by a car.</i>

28:04.975 --> 28:06.977
<i>I bet you were sad about it.</i>

28:09.855 --> 28:11.607
<i>I found a new cat.</i>

28:12.858 --> 28:14.527
<i>There's always another cat.</i>

28:16.028 --> 28:18.155
<i>Cats are different than people.</i>

28:19.782 --> 28:21.117
<i>You lost your mother.</i>

28:22.201 --> 28:24.495
<i>How did it feel to lose a family member?</i>

28:26.831 --> 28:29.666
<i>- Blood doesn't make you family.
- Hmm.</i>

28:29.667 --> 28:32.252
<i>What makes you family
is how much people love you.</i>

28:32.253 --> 28:35.339
<i>- Your mother didn't love you?
- She wasn't family.</i>

28:39.009 --> 28:40.677
<i>What makes you family</i>

28:40.678 --> 28:43.389
<i>is how much people love you.</i>

28:50.187 --> 28:52.064
Someone out there loved Deirdre.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.983
Enough to set Brenda Leeland up to die.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.444
- Enough to kill Maria.
- We think.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.904
If that's true,
then they got their revenge.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.907
So why won't they leave you alone?

29:05.202 --> 29:07.663
I guess revenge
didn't make the pain go away.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.710
- [indistinct chatter]
- [phones ringing]

29:18.841 --> 29:20.341
We found him!

29:20.342 --> 29:22.010
- [Sampson] What?
- [laughing]

29:22.011 --> 29:23.803
I've got Hardy and Akbar
writing a warrant,

29:23.804 --> 29:26.181
but it's in Virginia,
so it's gonna take some time until we--

29:26.182 --> 29:29.267
Stop, stop, stop. You found who?
The Fanboy?

29:29.268 --> 29:30.810
One of Shannon's friends tells me

29:30.811 --> 29:32.812
that she had some skin condition.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.773
Dermatome, dermatomite--
however the fuck you say it.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.319
Key part is, if it doesn't get treated,
it spreads.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.197
And from the way you talk about Fanboy,

29:42.198 --> 29:44.991
that won't do at all, right?
She needs to be perfect.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.285
But you can't fix it
with over-the-counter medication.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.953
You can't even get it
at a regular pharmacy.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.247
It has to be custom-mixed
at a compounding pharmacy.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.916
There's only three in the DMV,

29:52.917 --> 29:54.542
and only one filled a prescription for it

29:54.543 --> 29:57.045
- two days ago.
- Where?
- [Vega] Kugler's.

29:57.046 --> 29:59.172
Customer picked it up yesterday. Boom.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.424
Please tell me you got a name.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.968
Harry Powers. Couldn't get access

30:03.969 --> 30:06.137
to the customer file, but we worked
that name till we narrowed it down

30:06.138 --> 30:07.388
to one motherfucker in the DMV.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.029
This old Robert Mitchum film.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.533
He, uh, he plays a serial killer named...

30:26.534 --> 30:29.285
Harry Powers? Are you shitting me?

30:29.286 --> 30:31.205
Waste of fucking time!

30:32.289 --> 30:33.957
No. It's not.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.793
Eh, fake person,
but it's not like a catfish profile

30:36.794 --> 30:38.503
on a dating app.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.296
If he can get a prescription in that name,

30:40.297 --> 30:42.715
then it's got to be tied
to something we can track--

30:42.716 --> 30:44.551
a bank account, a driver's license.
He may have even

30:44.552 --> 30:46.386
pinned it to a Social Security number.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.054
[Sampson] Hmm.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.313
[Ramsey] Great.
And I'll take that one, too.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.857
Uh, most people like to leave a key

30:59.858 --> 31:01.693
on the inside if there's no bolt turn.

31:01.694 --> 31:05.154
Just in case-- fire, accident--
this type of thing.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.156
[Ramsey] I'll take my chances.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.243
[sinister music playing]

31:11.287 --> 31:12.996
And tell Lem to see me on the way out.
