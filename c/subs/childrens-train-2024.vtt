BASED ON THE NOVEL
THE CHILDREN'S TRAIN BY VIOLA ARDONE

00:51.125 --> 00:55.458
VIOLIN SOLOIST - AMERIGO BENVENUTI
MARCH 18, 1994 AT 8:30 P.M.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.375
- Good evening, Maestro.
- Good evening.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.250
Hello?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.000
Hi, Mom.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.958
Yes, I just got here.
I still need to get ready.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.666
What is it?

01:34.583 --> 01:35.458
When?

01:39.833 --> 01:40.750
I see.

01:43.958 --> 01:46.125
Yes, of course. I will.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.875
I have to go now.
I'll call you after the concert, Mom.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.166
Bye.

02:01.708 --> 02:02.541
Yes?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.708
Good evening, Maestro.

02:07.291 --> 02:08.166
Are you ready?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.666
There's a lovely turnout tonight.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.958
Did you choose the shoes yet?

02:20.416 --> 02:21.500
What's the matter?

02:24.208 --> 02:25.416
My mother died.

02:26.791 --> 02:28.708
Should we cancel the concert?

02:28.708 --> 02:30.666
No.

02:31.666 --> 02:35.125
- We can, if you don't feel up to it.
- Of course not. Don't worry.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.750
Everything's fine.

03:10.375 --> 03:11.208
Maestro.

03:13.833 --> 03:14.708
Go ahead.

04:55.208 --> 05:00.291
NAPLES 1944

05:10.666 --> 05:13.166
Hey! Get out of your houses!

05:15.333 --> 05:16.833
- Run!
- Faster!

05:19.708 --> 05:20.708
Amerigo!

05:24.333 --> 05:25.250
Amerigo!

05:27.458 --> 05:28.791
- Run!
- Amerigo!

05:29.416 --> 05:30.458
Where's Amerigo?

05:30.458 --> 05:32.750
- I didn't see anyone!
- That's impossible!

05:33.541 --> 05:36.041
- Amerigo! No!
- Just run!

05:36.541 --> 05:37.375
Amerigo!

05:38.541 --> 05:42.166
Did you see Amerigo?
How is it possible? Amerigo!

06:13.458 --> 06:14.625
Amerigo!

06:21.291 --> 06:22.208
Mom?

06:24.250 --> 06:25.208
Mom?

06:27.541 --> 06:28.541
- Ameri...
- Mom?

06:29.416 --> 06:30.625
Amerigo, where are you?

06:31.208 --> 06:32.833
- Mom?
- Where are you?

06:32.833 --> 06:35.500
- Mom?
- Where are you, Amerigo?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.125
- Mom...
- Amerigo.

06:38.750 --> 06:39.875
Are you okay?

06:42.541 --> 06:43.958
Damn you.

07:05.833 --> 07:12.416
THE CHILDREN'S TRAIN

07:13.250 --> 07:16.416
NAPLES 1946

07:17.333 --> 07:19.708
One point. Two points.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.375
Zero points.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.000
One point.

07:23.833 --> 07:24.916
Zero points.

07:24.916 --> 07:26.541
No points.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.000
Star prize!

07:32.000 --> 07:34.375
Enough with the numbers, Amerigo.
Hurry up.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.791
If I get to ten,
something good will happen.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.166
- Where are you taking me?
- This one?

07:43.166 --> 07:44.666
- This one.
- Just the one.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.958
- Here. You want pizza too?
- Come.

07:49.958 --> 07:51.291
Amerigo, come on.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.083
- Hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.541
- Is this where the communists are?
- First floor.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.750
- Zero.
- Russo.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.666
- Zero.
- It's still early.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.708
- Zero.
- It's okay.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.750
Zero.

08:13.666 --> 08:15.333
- Zero--
- You're obsessed.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.750
Desiano.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.125
- Where will they take us?
- Speranza?

08:19.125 --> 08:20.083
That's me!

08:21.375 --> 08:22.250
Go.

08:24.083 --> 08:28.041
You're doing your son a big favor.
You're very brave.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.666
People don't trust us.

08:29.666 --> 08:33.541
Comrades went from house to house.
You understood right away.

08:33.541 --> 08:35.541
Stop it! I'm sorry.

08:35.541 --> 08:36.958
Let him be.

08:37.791 --> 08:40.125
Let him be. Look.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.375
- Do you know what this is?
- No.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.416
No? This is a medal of valor.

08:47.416 --> 08:50.625
The Germans tried to blow up
the Sanità Bridge,

08:50.625 --> 08:52.708
but we saved it.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.083
That's how I got it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.291
They should've given you good shoes.
Yours have holes in them.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.291
Let's go. See what he's like?
He's a punishment from God.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.041
Are you sure you want him?

09:07.708 --> 09:09.458
He's the only one I have left.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.500
- I need to think about it.
- Of course.

09:16.916 --> 09:18.250
Where are you going?

09:23.708 --> 09:25.708
Pork rind and ricotta. Just one.

09:25.708 --> 09:26.750
Sure, ma'am.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.916
Here's your pizza, young man.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.500
Thanks.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.208
Thanks.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.125
You heard her, right?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.041
You're a big boy now. You're eight.

09:48.541 --> 09:49.958
Things here are...

09:51.875 --> 09:53.500
I mean, we need to figure out...

09:54.833 --> 09:57.750
- You know me, Amerigo, words...
- They're not your thing.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.875
Yeah. Look at the state of you.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.291
They're taking all the children
and putting them on a train.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.541
That's 200 children.

10:06.541 --> 10:10.125
Two hundred? There are
way more than that. Poor kids.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.875
- They're going to work in America.
- You got it wrong.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.083
They're Russians, not Americans.

10:15.083 --> 10:19.000
They'll cut their hands and feet off
and throw them in the oven. Poor things.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.375
The Russians, they eat children.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.833
None of this would've happened
if the King was here.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.333
Why are you talking? You don't have kids.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.500
Kids are not for sale.
It's a matter of dignity!

10:30.500 --> 10:34.166
The communists want to help.
They want to give us some hope.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.250
Godless people.
They want to turn the world upside-down.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.833
Let's not exaggerate.

10:38.833 --> 10:43.333
Antonietta, you're selling your son too?
I didn't expect that from you.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.833
Hey. You know my story.

10:45.833 --> 10:49.166
My husband had to go to America
to seek his fortune.

10:49.166 --> 10:52.708
Antonietta, give me a break. America.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.625
Let's go.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.333
The nuns.

11:02.958 --> 11:08.458
Antonietta. You're a good Christian.
The Lord sees everything, you know?

11:08.458 --> 11:13.541
Children don't belong to their mothers
or fathers. They're God's children.

11:13.541 --> 11:16.625
What do you want from me?
I didn't decide anything.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.166
Excuse me.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.500
I really didn't need
a lecture from the nuns.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.500
Where were they when my Luigi got sick?

11:27.500 --> 11:31.208
- You really want to send me to Russia?
- Russia, Amerì?

11:31.208 --> 11:32.791
Don't you start too.

11:32.791 --> 11:35.041
I want to go to America to meet my dad.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.750
- Your father's a great man.
- When's he coming back?

11:41.916 --> 11:42.875
He'll come back.

11:44.583 --> 11:45.458
Sooner or later.

11:58.416 --> 12:01.083
Listen carefully, kids.

12:01.083 --> 12:05.416
Women and wine,
they're one and the same, okay?

12:06.666 --> 12:09.833
You either dominate them,
or they'll dominate you.

12:10.916 --> 12:15.583
Do as Capa 'E Fierro does.
You must always be free men.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.666
- Got it?
- Yes, got it, Capa 'E Fierro.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.583
Here.

12:22.958 --> 12:23.916
Here.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.791
- And this?
- Give it to me!

12:29.791 --> 12:33.958
- And this? It's for whoever catches it.
- Give it to me!

12:33.958 --> 12:36.208
- I caught it!
- I caught it!

12:36.208 --> 12:39.208
- Good morning, Capa 'E Fierro.
- Hello, Don Michele.

12:39.208 --> 12:42.458
- Greetings. Have a nice day.
- You too, ma'am.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.583
Hey, kiddo. Where's your mom?

12:56.250 --> 12:58.416
- Good morning, Capa 'E Fierro.
- Hello.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.500
- Do you need anything?
- Two sacks.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.375
Here you go.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.500
COLOMBIAN COFFEE

13:19.500 --> 13:22.875
And this is for your trouble.

13:25.041 --> 13:27.666
Don't worry. There's room under the bed.

13:27.666 --> 13:30.958
What about on top of the bed?
Is there any room there?

13:34.166 --> 13:36.750
- No coffee for me?
- Of course.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.625
What about you?
When are you going to the Soviets?

13:41.625 --> 13:43.791
- What do you care?
- Show some respect!

13:43.791 --> 13:48.166
Let him be. You'll see,
they'll teach you some manners in Siberia.

13:50.541 --> 13:53.000
- Go. I need to talk to your mother.
- I'm busy.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.166
So stubborn. Go find some rags!

13:56.208 --> 13:57.125
Go.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.416
Don't come back with an empty basket.

14:04.833 --> 14:05.875
Come here.

14:07.166 --> 14:10.458
- I thought you wanted coffee.
- I want you, not coffee.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.083
Keep your voice down!

14:13.083 --> 14:16.958
T-shirts, socks,
undershirts, kitchen towels.

14:16.958 --> 14:20.250
- Old sheets, we'll take anything.
- We'll take anything.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.500
If they had money,
they wouldn't send you to the communists.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.958
Hey, kids, hold on.

14:26.708 --> 14:30.125
- My dad's taking me to Ischia this year.
- Lucky you.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.583
- Hello, Solachianello.
- Hi, Amerigo.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.041
I'll shoot you!

14:39.166 --> 14:41.666
Throw it here.

14:41.666 --> 14:42.791
I'll shoot you!

14:50.833 --> 14:56.833
Smell them. Onions. Garlic.
Hey, get out of here. Don't touch.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.583
How much is this?

14:58.583 --> 15:01.083
It's all good stuff.

15:01.083 --> 15:05.166
Hey, kid. We're working here.
Get out of here.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.541
Not today. Go on.

15:07.541 --> 15:13.000
Hey! I've got the best bread in Naples.
Come and buy some!

15:13.000 --> 15:16.791
Broad beans, chickpeas. Come and get them.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.708
Thief!

15:17.708 --> 15:21.458
- Where?
- Thief! Catch him!

15:22.375 --> 15:25.250
Get your hands off. Get out of here!

15:25.833 --> 15:29.416
Feel it. Huh? It's soft as velvet.

15:29.416 --> 15:33.000
It looks like ermine.
You'll be like a movie star.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.708
- Alida Valli.
- It's beautiful.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.791
Three animals for 250 lire.

15:36.791 --> 15:39.041
You convinced me. I'll take one.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.250
Here you go.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.875
- You know what? I'll take one too.
- Right away. Here you are.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.458
Thank you.

15:50.125 --> 15:51.458
Thank you very much.

15:51.458 --> 15:57.416
<i>But has a sweet fire</i>

15:57.416 --> 16:01.750
<i>Once it enters the heart
They are darker...</i>

16:01.750 --> 16:03.875
Amerigo, you should choose better.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.833
These aren't worth anything.

16:06.500 --> 16:12.458
<i>Who can forget you
Eyes that reason</i>

16:12.458 --> 16:17.708
<i>Without speaking
Without speaking</i>

16:42.125 --> 16:45.083
Get those ice blocks off me.
What am I? Your heater?

16:45.666 --> 16:47.833
- My feet are cold.
- Yeah, I noticed.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.666
Hey, cut it out.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.250
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

17:12.250 --> 17:14.791
You, kill me?
Can't you see I'm stronger than you?

17:14.791 --> 17:17.666
Yeah, sure. You'll end up dead here.

17:17.666 --> 17:18.916
Yeah, right!

17:19.625 --> 17:22.916
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

17:22.916 --> 17:26.750
My beloved creator,
this is all I have to offer you.

17:26.750 --> 17:31.958
I'm a widow with five children.
You're the only one who can help me.

17:32.875 --> 17:36.666
Hey! Boys. You can't play in here.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.333
Show some respect for the dead.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.875
Get out of here.

17:41.875 --> 17:45.708
Dear <i>capuzzella</i>, bring my son back.

17:45.708 --> 17:49.583
He's a prisoner in Greece. I love you.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.333
<i>Capuzzella</i>. My dear <i>capuzzella</i>...

17:54.333 --> 17:57.333
What are you doing?
Stealing from the dead is a sin.

17:57.916 --> 18:01.708
They're dead. They don't need to buy
anything. Better if I keep it.

18:01.708 --> 18:05.583
Look. This one was blinded.

18:06.166 --> 18:10.000
I think a bomb hit him.
This one was a soldier.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.125
Damn you!

18:15.750 --> 18:18.375
Tommasino, what do you make of this rat?

18:18.375 --> 18:21.458
It's just a rat. And it's gross.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.291
No. That's money.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.541
What are you doing?

18:32.833 --> 18:33.833
Gross.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.708
Here. If my dad sees me, he'll kill me.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.041
Thanks, Mariuccia. It's perfect.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.583
What's wrong?

18:51.791 --> 18:54.000
My dad wants to send me
on the communist train.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Why?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.416
Because my brothers work in a warehouse,
but I'm useless.

18:58.416 --> 19:00.458
I can't even heat up a plate of pasta.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.458
Yeah, but nobody's born an expert.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.791
They'll cut my hands off.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.958
No, the communists will put you
in the oven.

19:08.250 --> 19:11.583
Relax, Mariuccia. We'll make money
from these painted rats,

19:11.583 --> 19:13.833
and they won't put us on that train.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.000
What rats?

19:15.583 --> 19:17.375
- These rats.
- Gross.

19:17.375 --> 19:20.916
Get your furs. Fresh, live, new furs.

19:20.916 --> 19:25.208
Look, they're still alive. You won't look
so poor with this around your neck.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.083
Come and get them. Fresh furs.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.000
Two animals for 200 lire.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.458
No, that's too much.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.333
- I only want one.
- Fine.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.416
- I'll give you 100.
- All right.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.833
Here.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.041
Come and get them!

19:42.041 --> 19:46.458
Get a present for your wife.
Two animals for 200 liras.

19:48.791 --> 19:50.625
My God, it's raining! Run!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.625
Pasqualino, stop staring at the rain.

19:55.625 --> 19:59.208
Give me a hand, will you?
What did I bring you here for?

19:59.208 --> 20:04.416
This is a rat. You filthy little cheats!
Call the police!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.416
Call the police.

20:12.291 --> 20:15.000
- Call the police!
- Forget the police!

20:16.125 --> 20:17.916
We don't want the police here.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.583
Get rid of this filth, kid.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.208
I'll deal with you later.

20:29.625 --> 20:34.000
Honey, let's go home.
The kids are getting wet.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.666
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.833
I know your story.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.333
- Mom!
- I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.375
Will he be okay?

21:02.375 --> 21:05.083
Yes! You made the right decision.

21:05.083 --> 21:08.083
You're on your own, Antonietta.
You can't make it.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.708
Look. Here he is. Hey, Amerigo.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.000
Amerigo.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.416
What's wrong? Amerigo.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.291
The train will be fun, you'll see.

21:21.291 --> 21:24.250
Up north, they'll treat you
like their own, okay?

21:24.250 --> 21:28.833
They'll give you food every day,
clothes, new shoes. I'll be waiting.

21:35.916 --> 21:37.291
What do you want to do?

21:38.166 --> 21:41.458
If they give me new shoes,
I'll walk to the communists.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.000
Go and dry off. It's ready.

22:04.541 --> 22:07.458
Here. I'm not hungry.

22:15.583 --> 22:16.416
Thank you.

22:21.875 --> 22:22.750
Eat.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.416
<i>Ma'am, come, sit down.</i>

22:28.416 --> 22:29.458
- Hey.
- Sorry.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.833
Stand straight. That's it.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.958
Fusco? Desk...

22:35.958 --> 22:38.458
- I don't want to go!
- ...four.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.833
- We're here.
- Next.

22:39.833 --> 22:42.083
- Stop scratching.
- It's itchy, Mom.

22:44.791 --> 22:47.041
More to the center. That's it.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.666
- Speranza. Table five.
- Yes. Let's go.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.208
Next.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.458
Don't be afraid. We're here to help you.

23:03.458 --> 23:06.750
- I don't want to end up in the oven.
- Shut up.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.875
- Does he sleep well?
- Yes.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.833
Yes? Are you sure?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.916
I've got trachoma.

23:14.916 --> 23:17.291
Please, take him. Look how red his eye is.

23:17.291 --> 23:20.333
- Does she go to school?
- She used to. She works now.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.875
She can't walk well.
She got hurt while we were running...

23:23.875 --> 23:24.958
When was she born?

23:24.958 --> 23:30.541
May 12th, 1936. Just in time for the war.
A bullet grazed her head.

23:30.541 --> 23:34.208
- Please, take both of them.
- The girl's too young, ma'am.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.750
Do you have a job?

23:35.750 --> 23:38.250
I did, but after the war,
the men took it back.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.791
- The child's last name?
- Speranza.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.250
- First name?
- Amerigo.

23:43.916 --> 23:44.750
Age?

23:45.250 --> 23:46.916
Eight years old. Eight.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.000
Domicile?

23:49.375 --> 23:50.958
- Where do you live?
- In Naples.

23:50.958 --> 23:52.708
- Where?
- The Spanish Quarter.

23:53.958 --> 23:55.541
What time does he go to bed?

23:55.541 --> 23:57.416
When he's tired. Stop it.

23:57.916 --> 24:00.500
- What grade is he in?
- He's too dumb for school.

24:00.500 --> 24:06.208
I'm not dumb. I was supposed to go
to third grade. I can count ten times ten.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.666
- Brothers? Sisters?
- Luigi. He's dead.

24:09.666 --> 24:14.500
He was three. In just a month,
he died of asthma... What's it called?

24:14.500 --> 24:16.291
- Bronchial asthma?
- Yeah.

24:16.291 --> 24:19.083
I won't let it happen to him too. Stop it.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.416
Don't cry. Don't worry.

24:27.416 --> 24:31.500
You'll come back so nice and fat
your moms won't even recognize you.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.583
- Okay? Don't worry.
- Martina, Antonio, come here.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.750
Martina, come here.

24:46.083 --> 24:49.875
Tommasino! Are you waiting
for the ferry to Ischia?

24:54.166 --> 24:59.541
Are we ready? Come on,
the train's waiting. Put your shoes on.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.916
I don't have any shoes.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.375
- You don't?
- No.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.500
Come on, get him some shoes.

25:09.958 --> 25:12.250
Amerigo? Are you sure they fit?

25:12.250 --> 25:14.125
Yeah, they're perfect. They fit.

25:14.125 --> 25:17.250
- Aren't they a bit small?
- No. They're just fine.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.166
All right.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.500
No pushing. Slowly.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.291
Come on, the train's leaving.

25:24.291 --> 25:28.125
Don't sell your children.
They filled your heads with lies.

25:28.125 --> 25:31.625
They're taking them to Siberia.
And you know what they'll do?

25:31.625 --> 25:35.125
They'll boil them in big pots
and make soap!

25:35.125 --> 25:38.583
Listen to her. She's telling the truth.

25:38.583 --> 25:41.666
- It's true!
- She's not telling lies.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.000
It's all true.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.916
All true? No, it's not. Don't believe her.

25:46.916 --> 25:50.625
Yes, it's true.
The ones who came back alive told us.

25:50.625 --> 25:53.833
What are you talking about?
They're all lies! Shut up.

25:53.833 --> 25:56.333
They're not God's children.
They're beasts!

25:56.333 --> 25:59.250
- Beasts.
- Don't listen to her. It's not true.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.791
They even eat the fatter ones.

26:02.791 --> 26:05.958
- What are you... No! Stop!
- Shut up. Stop!

26:05.958 --> 26:07.416
- Mom!
- No.

26:09.333 --> 26:13.500
- Wait! Slow down!
- Stop!

26:13.500 --> 26:14.916
Mom!

26:15.500 --> 26:17.041
- Stop!
- Amerigo!

26:18.333 --> 26:19.250
Mom.

26:20.458 --> 26:23.083
- Get out of here.
- I want Mommy!

26:23.083 --> 26:25.416
- Still going on about this.
- I want Mommy!

26:25.416 --> 26:28.500
- Come on, say goodbye. We need to go.
- Mommy!

26:29.166 --> 26:31.625
- Come on, we need to leave.
- You're so handsome.

26:31.625 --> 26:34.833
I don't care about new shoes anymore.
I don't want to go.

26:36.666 --> 26:43.625
Don't listen to her. They'll be warm.
They'll be fed. Cared for.

26:44.291 --> 26:49.416
How many did trachoma, rheumatism,
cholera take away from us?

26:50.333 --> 26:53.458
Think about them. About their future.

26:53.458 --> 26:56.833
Don't take this opportunity away
from your children.

27:04.291 --> 27:09.666
To get rid of the Germans,
I picked up a gun and shot.

27:09.666 --> 27:15.208
And I saw my 11-year-old nephew
Gennarino lying dead on the ground,

27:15.791 --> 27:19.500
after he threw a hand grenade
at a German truck.

27:20.416 --> 27:26.458
I never want to see that again.
Kids shot dead, never again!

27:26.458 --> 27:29.708
This is another battle, against hunger.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.791
If we women don't think
about our children, nobody will.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.958
I love them just as much as you do.

27:37.958 --> 27:42.208
And I'll bring them back to you.
On my honor!

27:53.250 --> 27:54.833
Go, honey. Go.

28:00.416 --> 28:01.541
Slowly.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.625
Slowly.

28:06.083 --> 28:06.958
Mom.

28:07.750 --> 28:08.625
Hold on.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.041
Here, for the trip.

28:16.333 --> 28:19.416
Amerigo, go! Go on, go!

28:21.791 --> 28:25.208
- Bye, take care of yourself.
- Behave, okay?

28:27.916 --> 28:29.041
Come back soon.

28:32.958 --> 28:36.250
Tommasino! Mariuccia!
We're taking the trip together.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.958
Yeah, we're going together.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.166
I love you, bye!

28:53.541 --> 28:54.916
What's going on?

28:54.916 --> 28:57.375
We're leaving our coats for our siblings.

28:57.375 --> 28:58.708
What about us?

28:58.708 --> 29:02.625
The communists will give us another one.
They're really rich.

29:02.625 --> 29:03.833
Mom!

29:03.833 --> 29:04.916
I love you.

29:09.041 --> 29:12.041
GOODBYE MOM
WE'LL COME BACK STRONG AND HAPPY

29:14.708 --> 29:18.375
THE CHILDREN OF NAPLES
THANK THE MOMS OF MODENA

29:18.958 --> 29:19.958
Amerigo!

29:21.916 --> 29:23.083
Giuseppe!

29:23.083 --> 29:24.000
Amerigo!

29:24.000 --> 29:24.916
Mom!

29:26.583 --> 29:27.750
Mom!

29:27.750 --> 29:29.791
Ame... Amerigo.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.291
Amerigo...

29:32.291 --> 29:33.958
LONG LIVE SOLIDARITY AMONG PEOPLE

30:01.375 --> 30:04.958
I didn't throw my coat,
because my brother doesn't need it.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.916
I'm sure my mom sold mine.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.666
The numbers on our coats!

30:10.666 --> 30:12.541
How will they recognize us?

30:12.541 --> 30:15.125
They did it on purpose,
so they'll never find us again.

30:15.125 --> 30:18.416
- What are you talking about?
- The Russians cut kids' hands off.

30:18.416 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, right. My mom said
we're going up north for a while.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.083
- They said that to convince them.
- I'm afraid they'll cut my hands off.

30:26.083 --> 30:32.375
- We want to get off!
- Let us out!

30:32.375 --> 30:34.208
What's going on? Quiet.

30:34.208 --> 30:38.750
What's going on?
Hey! Enough! What's all the racket?

30:39.541 --> 30:41.458
It's a long trip. Behave.

30:42.041 --> 30:47.000
You'll drive us all crazy.
Sit down and behave. You, sit down.

30:48.083 --> 30:51.541
- Give me your hands.
- No!

30:51.541 --> 30:53.375
- No!
- Are you scared?

30:53.375 --> 30:55.000
You. What's your name?

30:55.583 --> 30:56.791
Tommaso Saporito.

30:59.833 --> 31:00.916
Give me your hand.

31:05.750 --> 31:08.458
- You? What's your name?
- Vincenzo Esposito.

31:12.875 --> 31:15.333
- And what's your name?
- Amerigo Speranza.

31:30.666 --> 31:34.250
What are you doing with that hat?
Put your hat on.

31:34.250 --> 31:36.875
Sit down. Go to your seat.

31:37.458 --> 31:39.333
Stop playing with the door.

31:39.333 --> 31:45.333
Hey! It's a long trip.
Get comfortable and be quiet.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.666
Come on. Get some sleep.

31:47.666 --> 31:50.250
Good thing this one's already asleep.

31:50.250 --> 31:55.583
Amerigo, you too. Take your shoes off
and get comfortable. It's a long journey.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.625
No, thanks, ma'am.
I'm scared someone will steal them.

31:58.625 --> 32:03.750
Who's going to steal them?
Come on. Get some sleep.

32:05.833 --> 32:08.375
- Will we get there?
- Of course.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.958
Look at all that milk.

33:37.208 --> 33:39.458
That's not milk. It's sugar.

33:41.541 --> 33:46.791
What are you two talking about?
That's frozen water. Like Don Mimì's.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.583
Yeah, but without the cherry on top.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.458
That's snow.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.583
WELCOME CHILDREN OF THE SOUTH
WITH THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE

34:04.583 --> 34:05.500
Welcome!

34:05.500 --> 34:08.916
NORTH AND SOUTH ARE BROTHERS
ITALY UNITED, THANKS CHILDREN

34:08.916 --> 34:11.958
BYE MOM
WE'LL COME BACK STRONG AND HAPPY

34:47.708 --> 34:49.791
NO NORTH, NO SOUTH, ONLY ITALY

34:49.791 --> 34:52.833
NORTH AND SOUTH
ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS

35:17.958 --> 35:21.083
Come on, cubs.

35:21.083 --> 35:24.500
Eat up! You sure won't be famished here.

35:25.208 --> 35:30.208
Hey! She's saying this food is for you.

35:30.208 --> 35:33.916
As long as you're here,
you'll never be hungry. Eat up.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.250
Come on, tuck away. It's for you.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.083
Eat.

35:39.583 --> 35:46.291
What's the matter? Huh? You don't talk
anymore? Did someone cut out your tongues?

35:46.291 --> 35:48.250
But Miss, there is...

35:49.166 --> 35:50.041
What?

35:51.583 --> 35:52.500
What?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.083
Mold.

35:55.791 --> 35:56.708
Mold?

35:56.708 --> 35:58.291
They want to poison us.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.250
They want to poison us.

36:04.125 --> 36:07.166
Silence!

36:07.166 --> 36:09.875
- Is there a problem?
- No problem.

36:09.875 --> 36:15.000
Look here. This? This isn't mold.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.291
This is a delicacy.
It's called mortadella.

36:25.833 --> 36:27.958
- It's good.
- It's very good.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.208
Eat up.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.541
- I already have some.
- Nice.

36:31.541 --> 36:33.958
- Who wanted some? No?
- I've got some already.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.541
You do? Does anybody want some milk?

36:36.541 --> 36:38.291
- You can have more.
- It's good.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.250
Go. Let's put it there.

36:41.958 --> 36:43.083
Careful, it's heavy.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.666
They're waiting for you.

36:46.208 --> 36:47.333
That's good.

36:47.333 --> 36:49.833
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, that's right.

36:49.833 --> 36:50.916
- Hello.
- Hello.

36:50.916 --> 36:53.375
- I'm Patrizia Ventura.
- The little girl there.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.625
- Hold on, we'll find her. Over there.
- Okay. Thank you.

36:56.625 --> 36:57.708
You wait there.

37:00.416 --> 37:01.541
Are you Maria?

37:02.791 --> 37:04.416
No, don't be scared.

37:05.500 --> 37:09.166
What a pretty name.
What a pretty little girl you are.

37:10.708 --> 37:11.875
Give me your hand.

37:12.958 --> 37:15.333
You don't have to be scared of us. Look.

37:16.416 --> 37:18.625
Look what I brought you. Take one.

37:23.541 --> 37:29.583
Good girl. Come on, let's go home.
I have all the candy you want. Come on.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.416
Come.

37:40.333 --> 37:44.791
Tommasino, if we tell them we're brothers,
they'll put us together.

37:45.541 --> 37:49.500
Amerigo, these people are from the north,
but they're no fools.

37:51.583 --> 37:53.291
- Amerigo or Tommaso?
- Tommaso.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.541
That one's Tommaso.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.500
- Are you Tommaso?
- Yes.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.666
I'm Libero.

38:03.750 --> 38:05.083
We were liberated too.

38:05.583 --> 38:09.916
Come on, let's go.
We're half an hour away.

38:09.916 --> 38:12.500
Gina already set the table.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.166
Come on, let's go.

38:15.166 --> 38:18.125
Let's hope you're still hungry
after all that mortadella.

38:20.750 --> 38:21.625
Come.

38:23.541 --> 38:26.083
- No. Come on.
- Listen.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.708
You have to make a sacrifice.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.541
You said the Rocchis would come.

38:29.541 --> 38:33.041
Yes, but Agostina's in labor right now.

38:33.041 --> 38:34.458
I don't even have a room.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.750
What do we do? Leave him there?

38:36.750 --> 38:38.416
Of course not, poor thing.

38:38.416 --> 38:41.125
No one else from the party can take him.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.583
- Come on.
- Please.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.458
Hi.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.041
My name's Derna.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.583
Amerigo Speranza.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.333
Go on. The hour grows late.

39:13.875 --> 39:15.833
Get moving. It's getting dark.

39:19.416 --> 39:20.875
Good God.

39:20.875 --> 39:23.458
It's cold up here,
and you don't have a coat.

39:24.541 --> 39:27.208
- Luckily, I have a blanket in the cart.
- Bye, Amerigo.

39:27.208 --> 39:28.166
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.291
Yeah, bye.

39:38.625 --> 39:39.916
It's just me, myself and I.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.041
You probably wanted a family.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.083
Can you understand what I say?

39:46.791 --> 39:50.375
I live alone. Maybe you wanted to be
with a real family.

39:50.375 --> 39:54.291
I don't know. I only wanted to be
with my own mom.

40:06.625 --> 40:09.916
Mom!

40:09.916 --> 40:15.458
There's a monster!

40:15.458 --> 40:16.833
What's the matter?

40:17.333 --> 40:20.333
There's a monster!

40:20.333 --> 40:21.791
Calm down. It's okay.

40:21.791 --> 40:23.291
Where am I?

40:23.291 --> 40:26.333
Don't worry. We're at home.
Are you thirsty?

40:27.083 --> 40:29.166
- Yes.
- Miss, please don't leave.

40:29.166 --> 40:34.375
- Don't leave, Miss!
- I'm coming, I'm here. I'm right here.

40:35.750 --> 40:36.666
I'm here.

40:37.875 --> 40:38.708
Here you are.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.375
Drink slowly.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.041
Did you have a nightmare?

40:46.583 --> 40:47.625
Can you sing?

40:48.333 --> 40:51.625
No, I don't know any lullabies,
so forget that.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.750
Can you read?

40:52.750 --> 40:54.083
Yes, that I can do.

40:55.791 --> 40:57.083
That's not for kids.

40:57.083 --> 41:00.291
- It's not a children's book.
- It's fine. Read, come on.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.625
You'll see it's not for you.

41:05.666 --> 41:06.625
Okay...

41:12.166 --> 41:14.458
"Short history of Italian trade unions."

41:15.291 --> 41:20.750
"The General Labor Confederation,
or CGdL, was founded in 1906,

41:20.750 --> 41:23.416
bringing together all the labor forces."

41:23.416 --> 41:26.125
"The dual structure is confirmed."

41:26.125 --> 41:28.541
"Vertical, with trade federations,

41:28.541 --> 41:31.458
and horizontal, with the Labor Chambers."

41:32.666 --> 41:36.916
"The federations' goal is to address
the interests of the sector,

41:36.916 --> 41:39.291
whereas the individual chambers..."

41:50.250 --> 41:52.583
What happened, Miss? Did a bomb go off?

41:53.666 --> 41:56.000
It's not a bomb. It's fog.

41:58.125 --> 42:02.041
We need to get some fresh milk.
And call me Derna.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.458
Don't be scared. It's a cow.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.666
I'm not scared.

42:11.250 --> 42:13.416
Have you ever seen an animal at home?

42:14.125 --> 42:17.541
Just rats. We ate all the rest, even cats.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.666
There.

42:24.666 --> 42:28.958
Oh. Well... Look at you.

42:28.958 --> 42:32.416
Luzio's clothes fit you just right.
Don't they?

42:36.208 --> 42:37.333
Look at you.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.958
This is Amerigo.

42:42.458 --> 42:43.750
Hi, Amerigo.

42:43.750 --> 42:46.958
That's my brother Alcide.
And these are my nephews.

42:46.958 --> 42:49.333
Go on, tell him your names.

42:49.333 --> 42:52.750
From now on, everyone speak clearly.
So we understand each other.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.125
You hear that? Go on.

42:54.125 --> 42:55.416
My name's Rivo.

42:56.958 --> 43:00.166
And you? Are you being shy? Come on.

43:00.958 --> 43:01.875
This is Luzio.

43:01.875 --> 43:05.333
And this little guy here is Nario.
Rivo, Luzio, and Nario.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.833
See what I came up with? Revolutionary!

43:10.291 --> 43:12.291
That's mine. It's not yours!

43:12.291 --> 43:16.541
How many times do I have to tell you?
Mine and yours don't exist in this house.

43:16.541 --> 43:20.083
We say that things belong to whoever...?
To whoever...?

43:20.083 --> 43:21.000
Needs them!

43:22.166 --> 43:24.416
Rosa, you're raising a fascist, you know?

43:24.416 --> 43:26.625
- Come on.
- And touchy too.

43:27.333 --> 43:30.291
Come on, get moving. Go do your chores.

43:30.291 --> 43:33.208
You should know
that we all keep at it on Sunday.

43:33.208 --> 43:35.541
Everybody works on Sunday.

43:35.541 --> 43:37.416
Rivo will show you, okay?

43:38.333 --> 43:42.541
Hey. Welcome, son. Come on.

43:43.083 --> 43:43.958
Come with me.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.291
Go with Rivo. I...
I'm going to the Party. I'll be back.

43:51.583 --> 43:55.833
Before the war, we had three.
The Germans took the other ones.

43:55.833 --> 44:00.416
Her name's Marta.
Do you like the name? I chose it.

44:00.916 --> 44:02.250
We already crossed paths.

44:02.833 --> 44:03.875
What?

44:03.875 --> 44:07.666
We already crossed paths.

44:07.666 --> 44:08.958
She's pregnant. See?

44:10.458 --> 44:14.208
You can go closer. She's good.
It's the bull that's mean.

44:36.791 --> 44:37.833
Hey, Nario.

44:40.291 --> 44:42.500
Hey, little guy. You okay?

44:43.333 --> 44:44.250
Little boy.

45:14.583 --> 45:16.375
Thief! I saw you!

45:16.375 --> 45:17.291
Ouch!

45:21.666 --> 45:25.541
Quiet. Don't cry. Quiet, please.

45:25.541 --> 45:28.166
Be quiet. Don't cry. Quiet.

46:05.583 --> 46:06.416
Listen.

46:11.125 --> 46:14.666
When Maddalena asked me
to take one of the children, I said no.

46:14.666 --> 46:16.250
I know nothing about kids.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.791
I know about politics,
trade unions, but not kids.

46:18.791 --> 46:20.291
They're not your thing.

46:20.791 --> 46:23.458
- What do you mean?
- That you're not good at it.

46:23.458 --> 46:25.541
That's what I always said to my mom.

46:26.125 --> 46:27.875
Why? What's your mom like?

46:29.208 --> 46:32.208
She's beautiful.
The most beautiful woman in Naples.

46:32.750 --> 46:36.041
I see men look at her,
but she doesn't pay them any attention.

46:36.041 --> 46:38.250
I'm the only man who sleeps in her bed.

46:38.791 --> 46:41.083
She's lucky to have a man like you, then.

46:41.875 --> 46:44.750
Actually, she says
I'm a punishment from God.

46:47.708 --> 46:48.875
Come on, sit down.

46:55.875 --> 46:58.250
Look at that. It's so big.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.500
- Are you going to get some wood?
- Yes.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.541
Good boys.

47:05.375 --> 47:08.125
Why does Derna dress in black
like an old lady?

47:08.625 --> 47:11.375
- Because she's always thinking about Lupo.
- Who's that?

47:12.333 --> 47:18.625
Lupo was a partisan hero.
He blew up the German post in Cavazzona.

47:19.458 --> 47:20.958
He'd hide in the woods,

47:20.958 --> 47:24.791
but one day, while he was coming down
the mountain to go see his grandma,

47:25.500 --> 47:26.916
the fascists caught him,

47:28.208 --> 47:30.458
and they tied him to a truck, alive.

47:31.833 --> 47:33.958
They dragged him all over town.

47:36.333 --> 47:38.125
He was howling like an animal.

47:40.791 --> 47:42.750
Aunt Derna's always thinking about him.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.666
Hey! Where are you going?

48:02.125 --> 48:04.041
Amerigo. Come here.

48:04.041 --> 48:06.166
I'll show you how to make bread. Come.

48:06.166 --> 48:08.875
- Hi, Amerigo!
- Come on!

48:08.875 --> 48:12.375
- Come on.
- Come and see the oven.

48:12.375 --> 48:15.000
- Come on.
- Come on, Amerigo.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.333
- What's wrong?
- Amerigo!

48:17.333 --> 48:19.750
- Amerigo!
- Don't you like it?

48:19.750 --> 48:22.125
- Amerigo.
- He's scared.

48:23.083 --> 48:27.500
I don't want to go in the oven.
They were right.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.791
Amerigo!

48:33.208 --> 48:34.416
Amerigo!

48:41.583 --> 48:42.958
What are you doing here?

48:43.791 --> 48:45.375
I don't want to go in the oven.

48:46.875 --> 48:47.916
In the oven?

48:50.166 --> 48:51.583
What did they tell you?

48:52.458 --> 48:55.375
Come on, son. Let's go home.

48:56.916 --> 48:57.916
Don't worry.

48:58.500 --> 48:59.625
Home is Naples.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.458
Come with me.

49:16.958 --> 49:20.583
When the wheat sprouts,
and the field turns yellow,

49:20.583 --> 49:23.750
that's when you can go
back home to Naples. Okay?

49:25.458 --> 49:26.875
How long will that take?

49:27.625 --> 49:30.500
Not long. You'll see.
Time goes by quickly.

49:38.833 --> 49:41.041
Easy, or it'll break. It's like a bayonet.

49:41.041 --> 49:42.833
I'm not wearing girls' clothes.

49:42.833 --> 49:45.958
Everyone wears a smock.
There are no poor or rich at school.

49:45.958 --> 49:47.750
- I'm not going to school.
- Wait.

49:47.750 --> 49:49.750
Luzio's here too. Aren't you happy?

49:49.750 --> 49:51.208
- Hi, Luzio.
- Hi.

49:51.208 --> 49:52.750
I don't want to see him.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.250
That's enough. You're going to school now.

49:55.250 --> 49:56.500
I don't want to.

49:56.500 --> 49:58.333
You already know everything?

49:58.333 --> 49:59.291
Yes.

50:01.958 --> 50:04.333
Benvenuti and Speranza. That's enough!

50:04.333 --> 50:07.000
- But, Miss...
- Silence. Or I'll send you out.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.166
Benvenuti, it's on you. Speranza is new.

50:09.166 --> 50:11.125
Okay, children.

50:11.125 --> 50:16.250
The war is over, now we're at school.
You have to pay attention. Backs straight.

50:16.250 --> 50:20.750
You can't eat bread. Put it away.
No sleeping on the desk.

50:20.750 --> 50:23.083
- Stop it!
- Sit up. Wake up.

50:23.083 --> 50:28.166
We don't pick our nose
to play jokes on your friends.

50:28.166 --> 50:33.583
Now, who can tell me
what two times seven is?

50:35.083 --> 50:35.958
Speranza.

50:36.541 --> 50:38.083
Two times seven is 14.

50:39.458 --> 50:43.166
Well done, Speranza. Had you already
studied your times tables back home?

50:43.166 --> 50:46.250
No, Miss. In Naples,
I used to count shoes in twos.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.666
Let's go. Slowly.

50:53.666 --> 50:56.041
I'll see you after the break. Slowly.

50:57.458 --> 50:59.666
Can you smell that stink of fish too?

50:59.666 --> 51:01.625
It stinks of fish.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.583
Naples, are you the one
who stinks of fish?

51:04.583 --> 51:05.916
He stinks of fish.

51:05.916 --> 51:08.916
Shut up. Your name's Benito, you fascist!

51:13.500 --> 51:16.250
Whatever, forget it.
Let's go out to the yard.

51:19.250 --> 51:20.208
Thanks.

51:21.166 --> 51:23.333
Anyway, you do stink of fish.

51:37.916 --> 51:41.333
I got you ruled and squared notebooks
and coloring pencils.

51:41.333 --> 51:42.375
Thank you!

51:43.791 --> 51:47.458
I've never had these.
There's even a yellow one.

51:48.291 --> 51:50.916
You still need a pencil sharpener, though.

51:52.041 --> 51:54.000
I can sharpen them with a blade.

51:55.041 --> 51:56.333
With a knife.

51:57.041 --> 51:58.583
Do you need anything else?

52:00.250 --> 52:01.083
Yes.

52:02.041 --> 52:04.875
They say I stink at school.

52:12.166 --> 52:15.375
The kids in your class are ignorant.
Don't listen to them.

52:16.583 --> 52:18.750
Every acorn thinks it'll be an oak tree,

52:19.333 --> 52:22.416
but most of them will be fed to the pigs.
Gramsci's words.

52:29.041 --> 52:31.500
- Want more hot water?
- No, I'm done.

52:37.375 --> 52:38.541
- Here.
- I'm cold.

52:43.750 --> 52:44.875
I'm still cold.

53:05.375 --> 53:07.000
- Better?
- Yes.

53:10.666 --> 53:13.458
I'm the mortadella thief.
Don't send me away.

53:18.291 --> 53:20.166
There are no thieves in this house.

53:34.916 --> 53:36.000
Listen carefully.

53:48.708 --> 53:51.000
Can you hear
how the A string isn't in tune?

53:51.875 --> 53:53.166
- Hi, Luzio.
- Hi.

53:54.291 --> 53:56.791
See these? They're called tuners.

53:56.791 --> 54:01.583
You just have to tighten the string
by turning this little peg clockwise.

54:04.333 --> 54:07.375
Quiet, Luzio, we can't hear a thing.
Come on.

54:09.208 --> 54:11.000
There. Hear the difference?

54:11.000 --> 54:14.541
Music is beautiful. It has the power
of a thousand thoughts.

54:15.375 --> 54:18.166
You think so? My dad was a carpenter.

54:18.166 --> 54:22.000
But his passion was music.
He passed it on to me.

54:23.375 --> 54:25.625
But none of these knuckleheads care.

54:25.625 --> 54:27.083
I don't like music.

54:29.416 --> 54:30.791
Go on, give it a try.

54:32.666 --> 54:35.625
Hold it like this. Good.
Chin on the chin rest.

54:36.125 --> 54:39.041
Hold the bow like I taught you to. There.

54:40.375 --> 54:43.708
- Good morning, Alcide. Hi, Luzio.
- Hi.

54:43.708 --> 54:45.416
I came to get the chair back.

54:45.416 --> 54:49.166
Hello, Mrs. Daniela.
Here it is, as good as new.

54:50.666 --> 54:55.000
Oh, poor things. They made them travel
all the way up here,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.125
then when the vacation's over,
they go back to their misery.

54:58.125 --> 55:00.291
- Right. Come.
- How much do I owe you?

55:00.291 --> 55:02.541
Don't worry. You'll pay me another time.

55:02.541 --> 55:06.625
It's not easy. You're generous,
especially with three kids already.

55:07.375 --> 55:08.625
Hey. No!

55:09.625 --> 55:12.875
Well, at least you had the chance
to learn a trade.

55:13.875 --> 55:17.166
What do you want to do when you
grow up? Repair instruments too?

55:17.166 --> 55:19.166
No! I want to play instruments.

55:23.583 --> 55:25.291
- He wants to play.
- Play.

55:29.125 --> 55:34.291
All right, Benvenuti. Write what you buy
at the butcher's on the blackboard.

55:34.291 --> 55:36.541
BUTCHER?
BANGERS

55:36.541 --> 55:38.708
Benvenuti, what are "bangers"?

55:39.625 --> 55:44.541
Children, please! We speak properly
at school. We say "sausages."

55:44.541 --> 55:46.458
Write, "sausa..."

55:47.166 --> 55:50.291
Since you find it so funny,
tell us what you buy at the butcher's.

55:50.291 --> 55:51.333
What's a butcher?

55:52.875 --> 55:55.000
Children, silence, please.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.458
The butcher is the shop
where you buy meat, Speranza.

55:58.458 --> 56:00.041
Oh, the <i>chianchiere.</i>

56:00.041 --> 56:01.583
What's a <i>chianchiere</i>?

56:01.583 --> 56:02.833
The <i>chianchiere?</i>

56:02.833 --> 56:06.125
At the butcher's,
you can buy '<i>o pere e 'o musso</i>.

56:07.208 --> 56:10.083
<i>Operemus?</i> Did you study Latin, Speranza?

56:10.083 --> 56:14.666
It could be Latin, because <i>'o pere
e 'o musso</i> is an antique delicacy.

56:14.666 --> 56:16.083
What is it in Italian?

56:16.083 --> 56:19.083
<i>'O pere</i> is the pig's foot,
and <i>'o musso</i> is the snout.

56:19.083 --> 56:20.083
Gross.

56:20.083 --> 56:23.708
- Gross.
- Children, please. Silence.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.458
Good morning, headmaster.

56:27.416 --> 56:31.791
This is Rossana Palma. She's from Naples.
Please, treat her well.

56:31.791 --> 56:34.750
Of course, headmaster.
Thank you, headmaster. Goodbye.

56:34.750 --> 56:38.083
- Goodbye.
- Cantarelli, sit next to Speranza.

56:38.083 --> 56:41.291
Rossana, please go sit
where Cantarelli was.

56:41.291 --> 56:45.583
Benvenuti, sit next to Rossana,
so you and Speranza cut it out.

56:45.583 --> 56:49.083
So, back to sausages. What do you
buy at the butcher's? Sausages.

56:49.083 --> 56:50.916
In Italian, we say...

56:50.916 --> 56:53.625
Sausages.

56:53.625 --> 56:54.791
Well done.

56:54.791 --> 56:59.791
On behalf of the party, we're very happy
you're willing to take Rossana in.

56:59.791 --> 57:03.375
Yeah, well, I just hope you communists
don't want to exploit

57:03.375 --> 57:05.291
this simple Christian gesture.

57:05.291 --> 57:09.541
You know our Pope doesn't really agree
with these transfers.

57:09.541 --> 57:10.833
Come on, it's ready.

57:11.541 --> 57:14.291
- Come on. Amerigo, you sit here for today.
- Time to eat.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.625
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

57:17.625 --> 57:19.916
Rosa made the <i>tortelloni</i>.
I made the broth.

57:20.416 --> 57:23.166
Derna's a good unionist,
but she can cook too.

57:23.166 --> 57:24.291
Can she?

57:27.833 --> 57:28.958
Sit down, Rossana.

57:30.958 --> 57:33.750
I don't need your charity.
I don't want it.

57:35.833 --> 57:38.166
This is not charity. We want you here.

57:38.666 --> 57:41.458
My parents are supposed to want me,
not you.

57:47.250 --> 57:51.583
Let her be. I'll talk to her later.
Come on.

57:54.166 --> 57:59.500
"It had gotten so hot..."

58:03.208 --> 58:05.666
Are you doing this for us out of charity?

58:09.083 --> 58:10.916
No, Amerigo. No.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.958
Come on. Bedtime.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.500
The wheat's still green, right?

58:23.500 --> 58:28.333
Yes. We still have time.
It only just sprouted.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.208
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:54.333 --> 58:56.458
Luzio, leave the hen alone.

58:56.458 --> 58:58.333
- It's time for the cake.
- Cake!

58:58.333 --> 59:02.041
- Come here. Look at that.
- Good boy.

59:02.041 --> 59:07.791
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

59:07.791 --> 59:14.875
<i>Happy birthday, Amerigo
Happy birthday to you</i>

59:14.875 --> 59:18.833
Yeah! Many happy returns, son.

59:19.958 --> 59:22.916
This... is for you.

59:24.916 --> 59:27.333
Come on, open it. We don't have all day.

59:30.958 --> 59:33.208
Easy, Luzio!

59:33.208 --> 59:34.458
Come and sit down.

59:34.458 --> 59:39.041
You already had your birthday.
It's Amerigo's turn today.

59:45.833 --> 59:50.375
- Do you like it? Alcide made it.
- Exactly, with these little hands...

59:50.375 --> 59:52.416
Is this for me? It's for me?

59:52.958 --> 59:54.458
Of course it's for you, son.

59:55.791 --> 59:57.833
- What is it?
- I don't know.

59:59.041 --> 01:00:00.958
So... Derna, you?

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:04.666
And you know what? I'll teach you
how to play it too. Pass me the violin.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.500
Here.

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:12.125
But remember, take good care of it
and always keep it with you.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:17.250
This is a special violin.
This is your violin. Look here...

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:21.125
-"Amerigo Speranza."
- Yes.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:23.708
- Come on. Are we eating the cake or what?
- Yeah!

01:00:23.708 --> 01:00:27.625
No. Hold on.
There's another surprise for Amerigo.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.083
This came from Naples.

01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:37.541
Amerigo. Go on.

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:42.625
Read us what your mom says. We're curious.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.000
- He wants to read it alone.
- That's okay.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.125
Who wants cake?

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:53.458
- Me!
- Come on. Pass those plates.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:54.375
Me!

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:59.083
"Dear Amerigo,
I couldn't write to you earlier

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:05.166
because I had lots to do
and I was ashamed to ask Maddalena."

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:08.708
"All the women on our street

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:13.000
are so grateful,
they all turned communist."

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.625
"I'm happy you're eating.
They put Capa 'E Fierro in jail."

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:23.041
Capa 'E Fierro is in jail.
I'm happy. He's gone.

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:28.125
She talks about you too.
She said you can't be very lucky,

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:32.333
because out of all the kids who left,
you ended up with me,

01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:34.708
and I'm a punishment from God.

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:44.208
You're good.

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:48.375
Really good. Had you already played?
It's not your first time.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:51.791
No, I never played the violin.
This is the first time.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:55.333
Someone taught you something about music.
Like your dad, or your mom?

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:58.291
My dad went to America.
That's what Mom says.

01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.500
And your mom?

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.333
My mom sings beautifully.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:05.666
Then you take after her.
You have a good ear, you can tell.

01:02:05.666 --> 01:02:07.166
Your mom taught you.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:09.875
Yeah, right. Mom taught me
how to make smokes.

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:11.208
To make what?

01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:12.916
To make cigarettes.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:18.000
Go on. Keep playing.
But remember, Amerigo,

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:22.333
you need to practice every day.
Every day, okay?

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:31.416
The problem is that these guys think
we'll just go home without saying a word.

01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:33.875
- And they'll go back to work.
- That's how it is.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.250
We rolled up our sleeves and worked
in the factories during the war.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:41.666
That's how it is. When the men come back,
whatever we did doesn't count.

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:44.291
But the union can't stop
representing women...

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.375
- Of course not.
- ...now that the war's over.

01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:48.166
- Now's the time.
- Just a moment.

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:50.375
- Yes, but we can't just...
- We need to...

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.333
Amerigo!

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:57.125
- What are we going to do?
- We gathered the sign-ups...

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.791
We have all the signatures.

01:02:58.791 --> 01:03:01.375
I think you practiced enough for today.

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:04.791
Alcide said I have to practice
all the time, every day.

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:07.375
And you have improved,
but I have a meeting.

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:10.916
- Unity is strength.
- Yeah, unity is strength, but then...

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.291
Yes, I already have some sign-ups.

01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:19.208
- Hi, Amerigo.
- Hi.

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:20.541
But we can't...

01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:24.958
No, it's important that they come,
they speak and tell us about their work.

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:27.250
- Yeah.
- We'll let them speak onstage.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.000
Yes, right. Onstage.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.750
- Go on, write.
- Give some names.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:33.041
- Go on.
- Okay, Albertina Vanotti.

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:34.333
- Albertina...
- Then...

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:35.916
Cesarina Sartor.

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.083
Anna Maria Girone.

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.166
Federica Schiatti.

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:40.333
Girone is the one who was seeing Fausto?

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.208
Of course.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:43.875
- She was.
- Yeah, she was.

01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:44.958
And Edda too.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.000
- Edda too? No way.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.958
- Who isn't seeing Fausto?
- Write.

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:51.666
- We'll call Edda too then.
- Come on.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
WORKERS

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:36.458
Well done!

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:38.791
Take this and go have a look around.

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:42.083
Come on. You can go now.
Rivo, watch your brother.

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:44.416
- Luzio, be good, okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:44.916 --> 01:04:47.916
LONG LIVE MAY 1ST
LABOR DAY

01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:57.791
- Come and dance with us.
- No.

01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:59.083
Come on.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.458
- It's written here.
- Yes, I saw it. May 10...

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:20.208
Amerigo Speranza!

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.625
Tommasino! Long time no see.

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.250
- It's really you.
- Yeah.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.875
Wow, you look great.
You look like a movie star.

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:30.875
You look pretty good yourself.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:33.166
Are you a communist now?

01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:34.750
Yeah.

01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:38.833
- Did you see Mariuccia?
- Mariuccia? Where is she?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:39.833
Come with me.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.583
I'm not giving you my cane!

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:45.708
I'll just take it then, you donkey!
Take this! And this!

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.458
Mariuccia, is it really you?

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.750
Amerigo. Tommasino.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:50.666
How are you?

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.583
It's been ages. How's it going?

01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:57.291
Mom, Dad, these are my friends
from down south.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:58.666
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, kids.

01:05:58.666 --> 01:06:00.333
What a handsome trio.

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:04.750
Mariuccia, did they cut your tongue out
and swap it with one from the north?

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:06.708
Come.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:08.833
Go, Mariuccia. Go with them.

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.250
It's your turn, go on.

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:12.208
Yes, another one.

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:15.458
- Yes.
- Hurry up, Gilda's coming.

01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:19.041
Luzio, Rossana,
these are my friends from down south.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.166
I'm Tommasino.

01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:21.208
Me, I'm Maria.

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:25.083
Children, there are people waiting.
Go play somewhere else.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:26.958
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.458
Rossana's from Naples too.

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:34.083
She took the train after we did.
She goes to my school.

01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:37.000
Yeah, but she's different.
You're not like them.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.833
I want to leave.
They can't force me to stay here.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.625
See? She's not like you.
They can't force you.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.583
I don't mind if you want to stay, though.

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.833
Why don't you go back south
to your mother?

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:52.708
She probably doesn't want you either.
That's why you came here.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.625
- That's not true.
- Nobody wants you.

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:55.916
- Nobody!
- Shut up!

01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:58.416
Stop it, Benvenuti!

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.500
Leave him alone!

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.375
- Enough!
- Stop.

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:05.791
That's enough! Stop it!

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:10.708
- Stop it! Enough. We don't do that.
- Break it off.

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:11.875
Well?

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:15.583
- Behave.
- What are you doing?

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:26.958
The women workers will go onstage,
but let's have the experts talk.

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:28.916
Anyway, we already decided who...

01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:31.125
We know about politics
just as much as you.

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:33.458
We fought the fascists more than you did.

01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:36.041
We fed the soldiers,
we made civilian clothes,

01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:39.166
we used our weapons.
Some of us got a medal of valor.

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:42.208
What do you want?
A medal for hanging a few banners?

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:45.333
I deserve one for being
in the party with people like you.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:48.166
Go.

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:49.791
Go.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:07.250
My mom would've reacted.
She'd have slapped that creep back twice.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.583
I'm not afraid of anything.
I did all sorts of things during the war.

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:11.708
- Yeah, yeah.
- I did!

01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:14.166
I don't know why I didn't react...

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:16.666
- You need to punch him next time.
- Yeah.

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:20.750
Like I did today, with Luzio.
I taught him a lesson.

01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:24.291
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:28.666
There's a limit to one's patience.

01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:39.083
Was your boyfriend really called Lupo?

01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:46.166
They called him Lupo.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.500
But his real name was Giacomo.

01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:14.416
I'm sorry...

01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:18.416
That's enough.

01:09:19.833 --> 01:09:20.750
Come on, eat.

01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:26.791
She asked to go to the bathroom,
and never came back. I'm sorry.

01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:32.083
Don't worry. Let's go back to class.
Let's go.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.333
Come on.

01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:40.750
Luzio, where's Rossana? What's going on?

01:09:42.083 --> 01:09:43.958
Rossana!

01:09:49.416 --> 01:09:51.791
Rivo, we need to look everywhere!

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:53.166
Until we find her!

01:09:53.166 --> 01:09:57.625
Rossana!

01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.708
Be careful! Look everywhere!

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:01.916
Rossana!

01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:04.916
Rossana!

01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:18.666
Luzio, what's the matter?

01:10:18.666 --> 01:10:19.958
Come down.

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:25.708
- What's the matter?
- Rossana's dead. It's my fault.

01:10:25.708 --> 01:10:28.541
I told her which way to go. It's my fault.

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:29.958
What are you talking about?

01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:31.541
She wanted to leave,

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:35.458
so I told her about
the train tracks behind the farm,

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:38.250
and to follow them all the way to Modena.

01:10:38.250 --> 01:10:39.291
Are you crazy?

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:54.708
If we hear the train whistle,
we jump into the ditch.

01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:56.875
If we make it on time.

01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:01.000
Rossana!

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:03.458
Rossana!

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:15.583
Rossana. Is that you?

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:25.541
Are you okay?

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:27.250
Yes.

01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:33.208
Come. Come home.
Everyone's looking for you. Come on.

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:36.500
No, I'm not going anywhere.
There's a dead body.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.583
What are you talking about? Where?

01:11:44.291 --> 01:11:47.875
Don't worry. You stay here,
I'll go take a look.

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:02.333
What did you find? What is it?

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.166
It's just a dead animal.

01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:23.708
Come with me.
We'll walk around the dead animal.

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:34.583
Don't look, okay? Don't look.

01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:54.750
What did you do?

01:12:55.708 --> 01:13:01.250
I put a coin in his eye, like the women do
at the cemetery for our ancestors.

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:04.250
That's how they remember the dead.

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:08.166
It gives them the strength to go on.

01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:32.208
Luzio!

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:37.208
Luzio! Where are you? Luzio!

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.166
Luzio!

01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:48.541
Amerigo!

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.333
Amerigo!

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:52.583
Where are you?

01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:55.250
Amerigo!

01:13:58.083 --> 01:13:59.458
Amerigo!

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:03.875
Come and get me.

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:22.125
- Amerigo. Luzio. Come here.
- Come on.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:33.125
Hold on.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:39.291
There's the tortellini Rosa made for you.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.708
And some bread and mortadella,
to eat during the trip.

01:14:47.208 --> 01:14:50.708
I put some salami too.
Then you can eat it with your mom.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.625
There are your books, your violin,
your clothes, everything.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:14:59.750
I'll write to you.

01:15:01.041 --> 01:15:03.333
You can write back if you want, okay?

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:04.541
Okay.

01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:09.458
Come on, son,
you're going home to your mom!

01:15:10.333 --> 01:15:13.416
- To your city. Aren't you happy?
- Yeah.

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:17.958
Go on, they're waiting for you.

01:15:22.125 --> 01:15:24.000
Are you glad you're going back?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.083
Very. And you? Are you glad I'm leaving?

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:30.041
Of course! But you'll come back, right?

01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:32.083
- Of course he will.
- Yeah.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:36.958
- Now catch me.
- No, Luzio. Come on, stop it.

01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:39.125
- No. Stop.
- Got you!

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:42.541
- Now you catch me!
- Enough.

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.333
Amerigo!

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.208
Thank goodness. I thought you'd stay here.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:49.458
Tommasino!

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:53.833
Remember, son, keep playing
because you're good at it.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:56.791
- And come and visit us, okay?
- Yes.

01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.291
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:03.833
Okay, so...

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:09.166
Bye-bye.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:12.333
Bye!

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:22.958
Be good.

01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:44.375
Hey. You knew he'd have to go back.

01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:46.208
Yeah, I knew, but...

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:50.166
Yeah... We knew.

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:05.125
That's right, eat up.
Do you want anything else?

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:07.333
My northern mom gave this to me.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.333
This is for the train,
so I can come back when I want.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.916
Wait, I'll be right back.

01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:11.916
Piazza Garibaldi... Naples Mergellina!
Naples, Piazza Garibaldi!

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:18.125
ELECTRIC AND OXYGEN WELDING
AFFORDABLE PRICES

01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:18.000
<i>Mom.</i>

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.875
<i>Are you tired, Amerigo?
It was a long trip.</i>

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.375
<i>It was really long.
I thought we'd never arrive.</i>

01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:27.041
<i>They gave me plenty of things
to bring home. Even a salami.</i>

01:19:27.916 --> 01:19:30.041
A calf was born. They named it after me.

01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:35.333
Right, because one animal wasn't enough.
Now there are two with the same name.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.791
Capa 'E Fierro moved to Afragola
with his family.

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:02.833
It's just you and me now.

01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:05.500
You hungry?

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.958
Derna made a sandwich with pink salami.

01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:10.541
Eat it, it's good. It's called mortadella.

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:14.583
What's that?

01:20:15.416 --> 01:20:16.833
Mom, this is a violin.

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:21.166
Oh. They turned you
into a music teacher up north?

01:20:21.166 --> 01:20:23.375
- It's got my name on it.
- I can't read.

01:20:24.916 --> 01:20:26.625
I can play it for you, though.

01:20:28.583 --> 01:20:31.875
Listen to me.
We don't have time for this stuff here.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:37.458
I spoke to Solachianello again.
He'll take you on at his shop.

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:42.916
You can learn a trade, and when
you're good at it, he'll even pay you.

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:44.250
No, don't.

01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.666
- No.
- Amerigo.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:47.500
You don't need it now.

01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:53.833
Where are your manners? Not even a hello.

01:20:53.833 --> 01:20:58.208
Antonietta, you wanted to keep him
all to yourself?

01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:03.083
Can he come with me?

01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:06.125
I want to see if he remembers
how to make onion frittata.

01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:08.416
He forgot. Believe me.

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:11.458
He forgot everything up there,
even his mom.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.208
What are you saying, Antonietta?
He's a kid, he'll get over it.

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:17.375
You never forget your mom.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:40.291
First, she sends me there,
then she gets mad at me.

01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:43.416
I want to go back
where they love me and think about me.

01:21:43.416 --> 01:21:45.333
My mom doesn't love me anymore.

01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:50.791
Kid, your mom never received affection.
That's why she doesn't have any to give.

01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:53.500
She took care of you for a long time.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.166
Now that you've grown,
you need to help her.

01:21:57.958 --> 01:21:58.791
Understand?

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:06.583
Let's go. Come cut the onions with me,
we need to make a frittata.

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:17.000
Come here.

01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:50.500
<i>Every two weeks, my mom picks up
a package from Maddalena.</i>

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.708
They send us cheese, vegetables.
Lots of things.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.166
My northern mom sent us a potato pie.

01:23:01.166 --> 01:23:04.916
She put pink salami in it,
which my southern mom really likes.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:11.208
Too bad all the jam jars broke.
What about you? Nothing?

01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:16.666
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure it'll all get here soon.

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:20.250
It's been three months.
They forgot about me.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:24.458
Thanks.

01:23:32.916 --> 01:23:35.083
Here, eat. You worked all day.

01:23:37.041 --> 01:23:39.666
<i>Without speaking...</i>

01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:44.500
What does Solachianello say?
Are you behaving yourself?

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.583
Did he teach you anything?

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:54.708
Yes. Did you go back to Maddalena
to see if they wrote to me?

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:02.375
I already told you, Amerigo.
There's nothing there.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.375
When will he start paying you?

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:20.041
Amerigo?

01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.875
- When's he paying you?
- When did you go there?

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:26.375
Enough! I told you there's nothing there.

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:35.875
Go home, Amerigo. Let's call it a day.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.958
What's it like up north, Amerigo?

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:45.750
They don't make noise,
and they listen to you when you talk.

01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:48.791
Mariuccia didn't want to come back.

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:51.583
Good choice.

01:26:14.916 --> 01:26:15.875
Where is it?

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:32.750
It has to be here somewhere!

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:43.791
In May, four Sicilian children
were shot dead

01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:48.875
and 11 farmers down on Labor Day
in Portella della Ginestra.

01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:51.291
The left was driven out by the government.

01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:54.458
A new war has begun above our heads.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:57.750
We only had two years of peace in Italy...

01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:01.833
Amerigo.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.500
Excuse me just a moment.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
Amerigo, I've been waiting for you.

01:27:09.833 --> 01:27:13.375
I thought something happened to you.
I didn't think you were like that.

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:19.458
I mean, those people fed you,
took care of you.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:23.125
They treated you like their own.
You could've answered.

01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:29.000
Your mom told me you would've come
to pick everything up. I waited, but...

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Where is it?

01:27:31.708 --> 01:27:32.625
Here it is.

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:34.708
Here you go.

01:27:37.375 --> 01:27:43.333
There were packages full of food too,
but I gave it to those who needed it.

01:27:43.333 --> 01:27:45.125
It was a shame to let it go bad.

01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:54.958
What's the matter?

01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:58.208
Hey.

01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:04.208
Your mom didn't tell you anything?

01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:13.000
Don't worry, it's not a big deal.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.250
Take a seat over there, okay?

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:19.458
Wait for me while I finish my meeting,
then we can write them a nice letter.

01:28:20.041 --> 01:28:22.666
We can tell them
there was a problem with the mail,

01:28:22.666 --> 01:28:25.333
but then you got everything, okay?

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:41.416
Amerigo.

01:28:51.375 --> 01:28:52.375
Amerigo.

01:28:53.708 --> 01:28:55.083
What are you doing there?

01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:57.583
Are you feeling sick?

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.125
Where's my violin?

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:11.416
- I want to know where my violin is.
- Violins are for the rich.

01:29:11.416 --> 01:29:13.208
It was mine! Where is it?

01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:16.625
It's at the pawn shop.

01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:23.541
With that money I bought food,
new shoes for you, and I put some aside,

01:29:23.541 --> 01:29:25.041
because you never know.

01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:27.375
Anything could happen to us.

01:29:29.916 --> 01:29:32.791
You need to wake up from this dream.
Your life is here.

01:29:35.166 --> 01:29:38.166
Your mind's always elsewhere.
Do you want to get sick too?

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.916
It's for your own good.

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:42.750
You're a liar!

01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:13.916
Where are you going?

01:31:13.916 --> 01:31:15.500
Is this train leaving now?

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:18.125
Of course it's leaving now.
Where's your mom?

01:31:18.708 --> 01:31:19.541
Over there.

01:31:33.083 --> 01:31:34.625
Come, sweetie. Sit here.

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:37.666
You sit there. Be good, okay?

01:31:38.541 --> 01:31:39.916
Try to rest a bit.

01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:43.375
- We're about to leave. Are you happy?
- Yes.

01:31:49.125 --> 01:31:51.208
Are you on your own? Where are you going?

01:31:51.916 --> 01:31:53.250
To my aunt in Modena.

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:00.458
I can't read.

01:32:00.958 --> 01:32:03.458
It says I have to go there
and live with her.

01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:05.541
Where's your mom?

01:32:08.541 --> 01:32:09.458
She's dead.

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.916
Did you hear the whistle?

01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:23.625
We're leaving, honey.

if she wanted to.</i>

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:23.791
<i>Otherwise, you had to come straight home.</i>

01:35:25.583 --> 01:35:26.791
<i>I waited for you.</i>

01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.416
<i>You were all I had.</i>

01:35:30.541 --> 01:35:31.500
Are you cold?

01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:33.125
<i>Amerigo.</i>

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.875
<i>- When you ran away...</i>
- How did you get here?

01:35:36.875 --> 01:35:38.416
<i>...I could've come to get you.</i>

01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:41.208
I had your address.

01:35:43.125 --> 01:35:44.166
<i>But I didn't.</i>

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:49.916
<i>Sometimes, those who let you go
love you more...</i>

01:35:49.916 --> 01:35:50.833
Come here.

01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:53.833

<i>Shine brighter than the stars</i>

01:36:21.333 --> 01:36:23.916
<i>They are darker than darkness</i>

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:28.625
<i>Like two sighs</i>

01:36:30.541 --> 01:36:33.083
<i>Each sigh burns</i>

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:37.291
<i>But has a sweet fire</i>

01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:41.250
