07:33.558 --> 07:34.660
There's a lot
of beautiful space.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.029
- Great.
- And I've been talking

07:36.029 --> 07:37.263
to a bunch of people.

07:37.263 --> 07:39.032
- Everybody's got something
to say about you.
- (CHUCKLES)

07:39.032 --> 07:41.670
Although one person
did call you an asshole.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.706
Who? Who called me an asshole?

07:46.706 --> 07:48.307
- Huh?
- Could do it in here.

07:48.307 --> 07:52.511
- What-- Who-- Who called
me an asshole? I'm curious.
- Put a fire in.

07:52.511 --> 07:54.380
Larry, we're not
gonna do this, okay?

07:54.380 --> 07:55.847
I don't give up my sources.

07:55.847 --> 07:57.617
I need you to respect
my journalistic integrity
right now.

07:57.617 --> 07:58.852
Journalistic integrity?

07:58.852 --> 08:00.453
Where's the integrity
of telling me

08:00.453 --> 08:01.587
that somebody
called me an asshole?

08:01.587 --> 08:02.856
Is there integrity there?

08:02.856 --> 08:04.591
It's a small part
of a larger story.

08:04.591 --> 08:06.024
I have to tell the full picture.

08:06.024 --> 08:09.595
But it's a universal fact that
everybody is called an asshole!

08:09.595 --> 08:11.964
I'm sure Mother Teresa was
called an asshole by someone.

08:11.964 --> 08:14.800
- Oh, I doubt that, Larry. No.
- Oh, I know I don't doubt it.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.470
Somebody must have said, "Oh,
she's so good. She's so good.

08:17.470 --> 08:18.670
What an asshole!"

08:18.670 --> 08:20.072
- Somebody must have said that.
- Larry, please.

08:20.072 --> 08:23.042
"Oh, look at Miss Perfect
helping the lepers."

08:23.042 --> 08:23.943
You know, come on.

08:23.943 --> 08:25.544
And I'm not giving
you the source,

08:25.544 --> 08:28.046
so we can just drop it, Larry.
That's it! That's it.

08:28.046 --> 08:30.249
All right, you know what?
You don't have to
give me the source.

08:30.249 --> 08:31.450
- I know who it was.
- You don't know.

08:31.450 --> 08:33.653
- It was Ted Danson.
- (SCOFFS)

08:33.653 --> 08:35.354
I just saw that.
I just saw that.

08:35.354 --> 08:37.084
- No.
- No? That's a tell.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.124
That was a look away. I saw it.

08:38.124 --> 08:39.959
That's not a look away.
That's a let's move along.

08:39.959 --> 08:42.895
That's it. It's not Ted.
That's all I'm gonna say.

08:42.895 --> 08:45.098
Oh, okay. Forget it.
I know who it was.

08:45.098 --> 08:47.401
(LAUGHS) I can't believe it.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.701
Who do you think it is?

08:48.701 --> 08:51.337
It was Troy.
The Deaf actor at the club.

08:51.337 --> 08:54.540
- Troy Kotsur, the guy
who won the Oscar for <i>CODA?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.809
I hit him with a golf ball

08:55.809 --> 08:57.409
- because I couldn't yell "fore."
- What?

08:57.409 --> 08:59.711
And I, I threw a
bagel at him too.

08:59.711 --> 09:02.214
What, do you think he signed
to me that you're an asshole?

09:02.214 --> 09:04.283
- Totally. Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES)

09:04.283 --> 09:05.719
Larry, let me ask you
a question,

09:05.719 --> 09:07.354
as long as we're talking
about the club.

09:07.354 --> 09:08.757
Sure, yeah.

09:09.557 --> 09:10.757
Are you Disgruntled?

09:10.757 --> 09:12.591
(SCOFFS) Disgruntled?

09:12.591 --> 09:14.726
- Yeah.
- You know about Disgruntled?

09:14.726 --> 09:17.496
When a guy puts a note
on the locker room door

09:17.496 --> 09:18.765
and there's a fight
inside the club,

09:18.765 --> 09:20.327
there's something there.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.639
I am most certainly
not Disgruntled...

09:24.172 --> 09:25.705
with a capital D.

09:25.705 --> 09:27.740
I'm disgruntled
with a small D, Willie.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.575
How could you be a human being
and not be small D disgruntled?

09:30.575 --> 09:31.911
Well, you're coming
at me with some

09:31.911 --> 09:34.214
big D Disgruntled
energy right here.

09:34.214 --> 09:35.449
I am not big D.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.286
Little D all the way.

09:38.419 --> 09:39.755
You sure about that, Larry?

09:41.222 --> 09:42.756
Yeah, I'm sure.

- Yes!
- Are you kidding me? What?

10:41.814 --> 10:43.649
I didn't know I was seeing you.

10:43.649 --> 10:45.918
- Oh!
- I thought I was seeing
Melanie Stainback.

10:45.918 --> 10:48.621
Stainback is my maiden name, and
I just kept it professionally

10:48.621 --> 10:49.856
because, you know,
it was too much

10:49.856 --> 10:51.451
to change everything
and confuse everybody.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.793
So Turner's my married name,
Stainback...

10:53.793 --> 10:55.494
- (STAMMERS)
- You know each other.

10:55.494 --> 10:56.962
Her husband was a writer
on <i>Seinfeld.</i>

10:56.962 --> 10:58.432
- MELANIE: Yes.
- Hobie Turner.

10:58.432 --> 10:59.764
Larry and I go way back.

10:59.764 --> 11:02.902
I'm sorry about this.
It's a total misunderstanding.

11:02.902 --> 11:04.370
We'll just--
We'll just take off.

11:04.370 --> 11:07.367
- Oh, why? No, no, no. Let's go.
- IRMA: Oh, come on.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.768
- What?
- MELANIE: Larry, I promise,

11:08.768 --> 11:11.110
everything that happens in here
is 100 percent confidential.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.513
So awkward, though.
Come-- You know.

11:13.513 --> 11:14.946
Let's go! (SNAPS FINGERS)

11:14.946 --> 11:17.249
- (SIGHS) Come on.
- Really, are you sure?
I mean, it's--

11:17.249 --> 11:19.519
- You want a mint?
- MELANIE: No, no, no,
it's gonna be fine.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.354
- You must be Irma.
- I am!

11:21.354 --> 11:23.957
- MELANIE: I love your necklace.
- IRMA: Oh,
what a beautiful office.

11:23.957 --> 11:26.658
Also-- Okay.
There's another thing he does.

11:26.658 --> 11:29.728
He has a thing about
phallic-shaped vegetables.

11:29.728 --> 11:31.330
- Get outta--
- We're in a-- We're in a market.

11:31.330 --> 11:34.433
I see him just stroking,
stroking an eggplant.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.836
- Are you insane?
- I look around,
he's stroking cucumbers.

11:36.836 --> 11:39.171
Yeah, I'd eat a cucumber
if it was square.

11:39.171 --> 11:41.140
- I don't care that
it's phallic shaped.
- Bell peppers.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.042
- All of this thing with food.
- Bell peppers?

11:43.042 --> 11:45.177
- What are you
bringing this up for?
- She doesn't care!

11:45.177 --> 11:47.013
Larry, it's all right.
This is a safe space,

11:47.013 --> 11:48.980
I promise you.
We talked about this.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.652
Yeah. Does your husband have
a very low-hanging scrotal sac?

11:52.652 --> 11:53.753
A lot of guys do.

11:53.753 --> 11:55.287
- LARRY: Oh my God.
- IRMA: How long is it?

11:55.287 --> 11:57.890
When he goes to the bathroom
in the night, can I just say...

11:57.890 --> 11:59.992
- No, you can't just say!
- I hear them

11:59.992 --> 12:01.394
- slapping on his thighs.
- Get--

12:01.394 --> 12:02.694
It sounds like, you know...

12:02.694 --> 12:05.231
- Get the hell outta here.
- ...a flip-flop
in a Mexican resort.

12:05.231 --> 12:07.900
- This is just nonsense.
- Just like a boom, boom.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.335
But that concerns me about you.

12:09.335 --> 12:11.136
- Is this why we're in therapy?
- It drives me crazy. I want--

12:11.136 --> 12:12.905
So you could bring up
long balls? Okay!

12:12.905 --> 12:14.240
I know her husband!

12:14.240 --> 12:16.242
- You know,
you're embarrassing me!
- MELANIE: Oh, no.

12:16.242 --> 12:18.878
In this room,
I am not your friend.

12:18.878 --> 12:20.846
I'm not your coworker's wife.

12:20.846 --> 12:23.349
I am your therapist. Okay?

12:23.349 --> 12:25.619
It looks like our time is up.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.123
We should go to lunch.

12:27.489 --> 12:28.387
Great!

12:28.387 --> 12:29.989
MELANIE: I know Hobie
would love to see you.

12:29.989 --> 12:32.659
It's been such a long time.
We could catch up, and...

12:32.659 --> 12:34.193
- How's this Sunday?
- IRMA: Yes!

12:34.193 --> 12:36.395
You'll come to the club
and be our guests.

12:36.395 --> 12:37.630
- Oh, great.
- IRMA: Yeah.

12:37.630 --> 12:39.165
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Yeah?

12:39.165 --> 12:41.735
- MELANIE: Larry?
- He's always free. (CHUCKLES)

12:41.735 --> 12:43.135
- Wonderful.
- IRMA: It's good for him too.

12:43.135 --> 12:45.037
You know what?
I'll put us all on a text chain.

12:45.037 --> 12:46.806
We'll just, you know,
we'll work out the details.

12:46.806 --> 12:48.107
IRMA: Oh, terrific.

12:48.107 --> 12:49.869
- Wonderful meeting you.
So, next--
- On Tuesday.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.178
- Yeah. Same time next Tuesday.
- Yeah, that's great for us.

12:52.178 --> 12:54.647
- Oh my gosh.
- SUSIE: What are the odds?

12:54.647 --> 12:57.950
- LARRY: Huh?
- IRMA: What? (LAUGHS) Oh my God.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.418
- She's wonderful.
- SUSIE: Good.

12:59.418 --> 13:02.354
I mean, she's not a magician,
what with you two, but you know.

13:02.354 --> 13:05.194
And you two are so good, huh?
What's that dig?

13:08.697 --> 13:10.062
He's never fucking home.

13:10.062 --> 13:12.565
I mean, he is never home.
He's at the club

13:12.565 --> 13:14.633
day and night,
and I don't really mind.

13:14.633 --> 13:17.169
I'm perfectly happy
to have him gone.

13:17.169 --> 13:20.507
But the issue is,
he hates the fucking place.

13:20.507 --> 13:21.841
Can I tell her about the letter?

13:21.841 --> 13:23.342
- He wrote a letter.
- No, no.

13:23.342 --> 13:25.510
- He wrote a whole long list.
- No. What the fuck
are you doing?

13:25.510 --> 13:28.347
- Do not go into my letter.
- This is a place where you talk
talk about what's private, Jeff!

13:28.347 --> 13:30.183
- Yes. This is a...
- SUSIE: He wrote a letter,

13:30.183 --> 13:32.184
and he won't even
sign his own name!

13:32.184 --> 13:35.421
- He signs, "Disgruntled."
- I was disgruntled!

13:35.421 --> 13:37.857
And I don't want to talk
about the letter anymore.

13:37.857 --> 13:39.959
- No more letter.
- Okay. Well, like I said before,

13:39.959 --> 13:41.193
this is a completely safe space,

13:41.193 --> 13:42.728
and if Susie wants
to talk about this,

13:42.728 --> 13:44.000
we need to talk about it.

13:44.599 --> 13:46.365
(DISTANT SNEEZE)

13:46.365 --> 13:49.502
Anyway, I just-- You know,
I'm at my wit's end, because--

13:49.502 --> 13:51.370
What's going on over there?
You guys hear the sneeze?

13:51.370 --> 13:54.373
- Uh, I don't think so.
- JEFF: I just heard a sneeze.

13:54.373 --> 13:56.676
If I heard the sneeze,
they can hear us.

13:56.676 --> 13:58.243
- Who's-- Who's over there?
- No, no.

13:58.243 --> 14:00.212
Um, I think
it's a doctor's office.

14:00.212 --> 14:02.816
And another thing.
I'm all about warmth

14:02.816 --> 14:04.850
and closeness and intimacy.

14:04.850 --> 14:06.919
He's a cold fucking fish.

14:06.919 --> 14:08.387
He never wants to cuddle.

14:08.387 --> 14:10.522
I mean, what kind of person
doesn't want to cuddle with me?

14:10.522 --> 14:13.029
- (DISTANT SNEEZE)
- Oh, wait, I heard that one.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.600
♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

14:24.438 --> 14:26.205
SUSIE: What are you doing?
What are you doing?

14:26.205 --> 14:28.211
JEFF: I don't know-- Velcheck?

14:29.110 --> 14:31.210
- Ugh.
- SUSIE: What? Who is he?

14:31.210 --> 14:34.180

14:34.180 --> 14:36.850
<i>He's best friends
with Takahashi.</i>

14:36.850 --> 14:38.885
He heard everything we said.

14:38.885 --> 14:41.854
- So what?
- I'm gonna be outed
as Disgruntled.

14:41.854 --> 14:44.093
You had to talk
about the letter!

14:44.660 --> 14:45.590
Ah!

14:45.590 --> 14:48.861
I thought the whole session
was very helpful!

14:48.861 --> 14:51.731
Arnold Velcheck,
right there on the board,

14:51.731 --> 14:53.032
next office over.

14:53.032 --> 14:55.134
- Velcheck, from the club?
- Yeah.

14:55.134 --> 14:59.573
And Susie yammered on and on
about the Disgruntled letter.

14:59.573 --> 15:00.539
Wow.

15:00.539 --> 15:02.975
Now I don't know for sure
if he heard that,

15:02.975 --> 15:06.078
but I wish I could get in there

15:06.078 --> 15:08.617
and see how much you can hear
and what it's like.

15:09.685 --> 15:11.284
Hey.

15:11.284 --> 15:14.386
Suppose I make an appointment
for you to go to this urologist.

15:14.386 --> 15:16.188
At the same time,
I'll make an appointment

15:16.188 --> 15:17.824
with my couples therapist,

15:17.824 --> 15:19.191
and see if you can hear
what I'm saying.

15:19.191 --> 15:21.226
I'll do that shit. Of course.

15:21.226 --> 15:23.830
I got one question.
What's a urologist?

15:23.830 --> 15:25.865
Pfft. It's nothing.
You pee in a cup.

15:25.865 --> 15:28.067
- You fill out a few forms.
- Mm-hmm.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.837
But mainly you're seeing if you
can hear what I'm saying

- Because he is a gentleman.

Have you ever had a fresh egg

- Yeah, I wanna tell you a story.
I wanna tell you a story.

Couldn't eat 'em.

right from the ground.
