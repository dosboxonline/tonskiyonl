01:02.400 --> 01:04.233
Hello.

01:05.027 --> 01:06.695
What?

01:07.446 --> 01:10.282
No, I don't work today.

01:10.825 --> 01:12.951
I'm playing hockey at 2:00.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.248
Why don't you call Randal?

01:18.916 --> 01:21.835
Because I'm fucking tired.

01:23.296 --> 01:26.331
I just closed last night.

01:26.431 --> 01:28.458
Don't give me this.

01:28.558 --> 01:32.679
What time do you think
you're gonna come in, 12:00?

01:33.931 --> 01:36.766
Be there by 12:00? Swear.

01:36.893 --> 01:40.353
Swear you'll be there by 12:00
and I'll do it.

01:40.646 --> 01:43.148
Twelve or I walk.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.632
Shit.

05:12.858 --> 05:14.267
Thanks. Have a good one.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.603
- Do you mind if I drink this here?
- Sure, go ahead.

05:16.703 --> 05:19.030
- You open?
- Yeah.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.742
- Pack of cigarettes.
- Are you sure?

05:22.993 --> 05:25.036
- Am I sure?
- Are you sure?

05:25.162 --> 05:26.238
Am I sure about what?

05:26.338 --> 05:28.281
Do you really wanna buy
those cigarettes?

05:28.381 --> 05:31.034
- Are you serious?
- How long have you been smoking?

05:31.134 --> 05:33.878
- What is this? A poll?
- How long have you been a smoker?

05:34.004 --> 05:37.841
- I don't know. Since I was about 13.
- Thirteen.

05:38.050 --> 05:40.927
Let's see.
You are about 19, 20, am I right?

05:41.095 --> 05:44.556
- What in the hell is that?
- That's your lung.

05:44.723 --> 05:47.934
By this time, your lung looks like this.

05:48.102 --> 05:51.479
- You've gotta be shitting me.
- You think I'm shitting you?

05:51.647 --> 05:52.814
Here.

05:52.982 --> 05:54.649
- What's this?
- It is a trach ring.

05:54.817 --> 05:55.934
It's what they install in your throat

05:56.034 --> 05:58.645
when throat cancer
takes your voice box.

05:58.745 --> 06:00.147
This one came out
of a 60-year-old man.

06:00.247 --> 06:02.149
Oh, God.

06:02.249 --> 06:04.651
He smoked until the day he died.

06:04.751 --> 06:07.154
He used to put the cigarette in this
and smoke it that way.

06:07.254 --> 06:09.573
- Could you...
- This is where you're heading.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.325
Cruddy lung,
smoking through a hole in your throat.

06:12.425 --> 06:13.577
Do you really want that?

06:13.677 --> 06:16.538
- Well, if it is already too late, I guess...
- No, it's never too late.

06:16.638 --> 06:20.167
Put the cigarettes back
and try some gum instead.

06:20.267 --> 06:23.211
- Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
- It's not the same.

06:23.311 --> 06:26.681
It's cheaper than cigarettes
and it certainly beats this.

06:26.849 --> 06:30.602
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.554
Keep it.

06:32.654 --> 06:35.307
- I'll just take the gum.
- Fifty-five.

06:35.407 --> 06:39.110
You made a very wise choice.
Keep up the good work.

06:41.488 --> 06:45.025
If you're gonna drink that coffee,
I think you ought to take it outside.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.319
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.

06:47.419 --> 06:49.196
Well, if you're gonna drink it in here,

06:49.296 --> 06:51.656
I appreciate it
if you don't bother the customers.

06:51.756 --> 06:54.042
Okay. I'm sorry about that.

06:56.378 --> 06:58.079
Pack of cigarettes.

06:58.179 --> 07:00.582
- What's that?
- This?

07:00.682 --> 07:02.800
How long you been smoking?

07:18.317 --> 07:20.902
We need some tits and ass. Yeah!

07:29.912 --> 07:33.031
I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We're gonna make some money.

07:33.131 --> 07:35.875
And then we're gonna go to that party
and get some pussy.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.495
I'm gonna fuck this bitch,
I'm gonna fuck this bitch.

07:38.595 --> 07:40.880
I'll fuck anything that moves.

07:42.424 --> 07:45.835
What the fuck you looking at?
I'll kick your fucking ass. Shit, yeah.

07:45.935 --> 07:48.255
Don't that motherfucker
owe me 10 bucks?

07:48.355 --> 07:51.091
You know, tonight,
we're gonna rip off this fucker's head.

07:51.191 --> 07:52.884
Take out his fucking soul.

07:52.984 --> 07:54.302
If he tries to buy something,

07:54.402 --> 07:57.430
I'm gonna shit
in the motherfucker's bag.

07:57.530 --> 08:00.191
Yeah, what's up, baby?
What's up, sluts?

08:02.027 --> 08:04.229
Silent Bob, you're a rude motherfucker,
you know?

08:04.329 --> 08:07.607
But you're cute as hell.
I'd like to go down on you, suck you.

08:07.707 --> 08:10.944
Line up three other guys,
make like a circus seal.

08:11.044 --> 08:16.783
Oh, you fucking faggot, I hate guys.
I love women.

08:16.883 --> 08:18.835
What you want, Grizzly Adams?

08:19.295 --> 08:23.214
You're spending, what, 20, maybe $30
a week on your cigarettes?

08:23.382 --> 08:24.499
- Yeah.
- Forty.

08:24.599 --> 08:25.625
Fifty-three.

08:25.725 --> 08:28.720
Fifty-three dollars
a week on cigarettes? Come on.

08:28.846 --> 08:31.423
Would you give somebody that
much money each week to kill you?

08:31.523 --> 08:33.008
Because that's what you're doing now

08:33.107 --> 08:35.677
by paying for this so-called privilege
to smoke.

08:35.777 --> 08:37.554
Hey, man, we gotta croak sometime.

08:37.654 --> 08:42.475
It's that kind of mentality that allows
the cancer-producing industry to thrive.

08:42.575 --> 08:45.478
Of course we're all gonna die someday.
But do we have to pay for it?

08:45.578 --> 08:46.646
No, no.

08:46.746 --> 08:48.481
Do we have to actually throw
hard-earned dollars

08:48.581 --> 08:49.983
down on a counter and say

08:50.083 --> 08:52.527
"Please, Mr Merchant of Death,
sir, please.

08:52.627 --> 08:55.822
"Sell me something
that will stink up breath and my clothes

08:55.922 --> 08:57.115
"and fry my lungs"?

08:57.215 --> 08:58.658
- Now, wait a second.
- Yeah.

08:58.758 --> 09:01.578
Yeah, here comes the speech
about how he's just doing his job

09:01.678 --> 09:03.663
by following orders.

09:03.763 --> 09:05.665
Let me tell you about
another group of hate mongers

09:05.765 --> 09:07.334
that were following orders.

09:07.434 --> 09:09.344
- They were called Nazis.
- Nazis, that's right.

09:09.511 --> 09:10.845
- Fucking Nazi.
- Yeah.

09:11.013 --> 09:13.673
And they practically wiped
an entire nation of people off the Earth

09:13.773 --> 09:15.550
just like cigarettes are doing now.

09:15.650 --> 09:19.137
- I think you got to leave now.
- You want me to leave? Why?

09:19.237 --> 09:21.056
Because somebody's telling it like it is?

09:21.156 --> 09:24.609
Somebody's giving these fine people
a wake-up call?

09:24.777 --> 09:27.062
No, you're loitering
and causing a disturbance.

09:27.162 --> 09:29.814
I'm a disturbance?
You're the disturbance, pal.

09:29.914 --> 09:33.826
You know? Here. Now I am a customer.
I'm gonna buy some Chewlies Gum.

09:33.952 --> 09:35.195
All right? I'm a customer

09:35.295 --> 09:37.697
engaged in a discussion
with the other customers.

09:37.797 --> 09:40.200
- That's right.
- Yeah, now shut up so he can speak.

09:40.300 --> 09:44.579
Yeah. See, he's scared now.
Because he sees the threat we present.

09:44.679 --> 09:47.332
- He smells the changes coming.
- You can smell it.

09:47.432 --> 09:49.376
You definitely are
the source in this area

09:49.476 --> 09:51.294
and we're gonna shut you down
for good.

09:51.394 --> 09:53.179
For good, cancer merchant.

09:53.389 --> 09:56.474
Cancer merchant, cancer merchant.

10:00.813 --> 10:03.189
Who's leading this mob?

10:05.150 --> 10:07.060
That guy.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.278
Freeze.

10:11.323 --> 10:13.199
What's going on?

10:14.910 --> 10:18.663
Let's see some credentials. Slowly.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.243
You're a Chewlies Gum
representative?

10:23.343 --> 10:24.335
Chewlies?

10:24.435 --> 10:26.913
And you're stirring up all this
antismoking sentiment

10:27.013 --> 10:31.509
to what, sell more gum?
Get out of here.

10:32.094 --> 10:34.254
And you people,
don't you have jobs to go to?

10:34.354 --> 10:36.089
Get out of here. Go commute.

10:36.189 --> 10:37.841
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.059
Bunch of easily led automatons.

10:40.185 --> 10:44.689
Try thinking for yourselves before you
pelt an innocent man with cigarettes.

10:50.529 --> 10:52.530
Pack of cigarettes.

11:00.247 --> 11:03.116
All right. Don't you think
you're taking this a bit too hard?

11:03.216 --> 11:05.827
Too hard?
I have enough indignities in my life

11:05.927 --> 11:07.871
and people start
throwing cigarettes at me.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.790
- Least they weren't lit.
- Oh, I hate this fucking place.

11:10.890 --> 11:13.126
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.

11:13.226 --> 11:15.795
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
at this point is a lecture.

11:15.895 --> 11:18.673
All I'm saying is if you're that unhappy,
you should leave.

11:18.773 --> 11:20.758
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

11:20.858 --> 11:22.635
I know. I stopped by your house.

11:22.735 --> 11:25.096
Your mom told me you left,
like, at 6:00.

11:25.196 --> 11:27.557
The guy got sick. He couldn't come in.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.392
Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?

11:29.492 --> 11:31.769
Yes. And I'm gonna play like shit

11:31.869 --> 11:33.938
because I didn't have
a good night's sleep.

11:34.038 --> 11:35.448
Why'd you agree to come in, then?

11:35.574 --> 11:37.650
Hey, I'm only here until 12:00.
After that, I'm gone.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.860
The boss comes in.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.820
Open the shutters, get sunlight in here.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.823
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.
- You're kidding.

11:43.923 --> 11:46.125
Bunch of savages in this town.

11:51.423 --> 11:53.082
Thanks.

11:53.182 --> 11:54.967
How much money
did you leave up there?

11:55.093 --> 11:57.837
Like, $3 in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

11:57.937 --> 12:00.673
This time in the morning,
people just get paper or coffee.

12:00.773 --> 12:03.343
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that?

12:03.443 --> 12:05.553
How do you know they're taking
the right change?

12:05.653 --> 12:07.347
Or even paying for what they take?

12:07.447 --> 12:10.183
Theoretically, people see money
on the counter and no one around,

12:10.283 --> 12:12.151
they think they're being watched.

12:12.277 --> 12:15.271
Honesty through paranoia.

12:15.371 --> 12:16.856
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

12:16.956 --> 12:19.025
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.619
The smell won't come off.

12:22.788 --> 12:24.697
Do you think anybody
can see us down here?

12:24.797 --> 12:26.741
Why?
Do you wanna have sex or something?

12:26.841 --> 12:28.201
Can we?

12:28.301 --> 12:30.453
- Really?
- I was kidding.

12:30.553 --> 12:33.998
- Like you can't get enough of me.
- Typically male point of view.

12:34.098 --> 12:35.542
How do you figure?

12:35.642 --> 12:38.711
You show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

12:38.811 --> 12:41.214
- What about what we do for you?
- Women?

12:41.314 --> 12:42.882
Women as lovers
are basically the same.

12:42.982 --> 12:44.467
They just have to be there.

12:44.567 --> 12:45.593
Be there?

12:45.693 --> 12:47.929
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

12:48.029 --> 12:52.433
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.394
How flattering.

12:54.494 --> 12:57.564
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

12:57.664 --> 12:59.023
Oh, you think so?

12:59.123 --> 13:02.068
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

13:02.168 --> 13:04.821
A guy makes a woman come, it's talent.

13:04.921 --> 13:07.323
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?

13:07.423 --> 13:09.409
I'm insulted.

13:09.509 --> 13:12.328
Believe me, Don Juan,
it takes more than that to get a guy off.

13:12.428 --> 13:14.956
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

13:15.056 --> 13:16.749
Oh, I've touched a nerve.

13:16.849 --> 13:19.752
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

13:19.852 --> 13:22.255
It wasn't directed at you.
I was making a broad generalisation.

13:22.355 --> 13:24.882
You were making a generalisation
about broads.

13:24.982 --> 13:26.759
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

13:26.859 --> 13:29.429
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

13:29.529 --> 13:31.431
- How many?
- How many what?

13:31.531 --> 13:33.224
How many different girls
have you slept with?

13:33.324 --> 13:36.144
How many different girls?
Didn't we have this discussion once?

13:36.244 --> 13:38.855
We might have, I don't remember.
How many?

13:38.955 --> 13:42.775
- Including you?
- It better be up to and including me.

13:42.875 --> 13:46.362
- Twelve.
- You've slept with 12 different girls?

13:46.462 --> 13:49.198
Including you, yes.

13:49.298 --> 13:50.416
What'd you do that for?

13:50.542 --> 13:51.659
- You're a pig.
- Why'd you hit me?

13:51.759 --> 13:53.369
Know how many men I've had sex with?

13:53.469 --> 13:56.414
- Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.

13:56.514 --> 13:58.791
- Three?
- Three including you.

13:58.891 --> 14:00.460
You've only slept with three people?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.211
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who?

14:02.311 --> 14:05.506
- You.
- No. Who were the three besides me?

14:05.606 --> 14:08.968
John Francin and Rob Stanslik.

14:09.068 --> 14:11.971
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

14:12.071 --> 14:13.806
You'll sleep with anything
that says yes.

14:13.906 --> 14:17.018
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.
- Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

14:17.118 --> 14:19.145
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

14:19.245 --> 14:21.814
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

14:21.914 --> 14:23.399
Name it.

14:23.499 --> 14:25.026
I want you to come with me on Monday.

14:25.126 --> 14:26.944
- Where?
- To school.

14:27.044 --> 14:30.156
There's a seminar about getting back
into a scholastic programme

14:30.256 --> 14:31.949
after a lapse in enrolment.

14:32.049 --> 14:34.160
Can't we ever have a discussion
without that coming up?

14:34.260 --> 14:35.662
It's important to me, Dante.

14:35.762 --> 14:38.498
You have so much potential
that's going to waste in this pit.

14:38.598 --> 14:39.707
I wish you'd go back to school.

14:39.807 --> 14:42.335
Jesus, will you stop it?
You're making my head hurt.

14:42.435 --> 14:43.753
Shit. Why are we getting up?

14:43.853 --> 14:47.014
Unlike you,
I have a class in 45 minutes.

14:47.683 --> 14:52.019
- Willam.
- Oh, hey, Ronni. How you been, man?

14:53.438 --> 14:58.351
- What, do you work here now?
- No, I was visiting my man.

14:58.451 --> 15:02.021
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

15:02.121 --> 15:06.567
- How you doing? Just the soda?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.863
So where you been, man?
Are you still going to Seton Hall?

15:10.963 --> 15:15.159
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

15:15.259 --> 15:17.586
That's beautiful, man.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.707
So you still talk to Silvan?

15:20.807 --> 15:23.801
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

15:24.636 --> 15:26.212
Oh, that's great.

15:26.312 --> 15:29.632
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

15:29.732 --> 15:31.434
Bye. Take it easy.

15:33.103 --> 15:36.647
- That was Snowball.
- Why do you call him that?

15:37.649 --> 15:40.435
Silvan made it up. It's a blowjob thing.

15:40.535 --> 15:42.061
What do you mean?

15:42.161 --> 15:43.438
After he gets a blowjob,

15:43.538 --> 15:46.482
he likes to have it spit back
into his mouth while kissing.

15:46.582 --> 15:47.900
It's called snowballing.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.820
- He requests this?
- He gets off on it.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.072
Silvan can be talked into anything.

15:53.172 --> 15:56.534
- Why do you say that?
- Like you said, she snowballed him.

15:56.634 --> 16:00.913
- Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

16:01.013 --> 16:02.999
I'm serious.

16:03.099 --> 16:05.084
You sucked that guy's dick?

16:05.184 --> 16:07.128
Yeah, how do you think
I knew that he...

16:07.228 --> 16:09.054
But you said you only had sex
with three guys.

16:09.181 --> 16:11.841
- You never mentioned him.
- Because I never had sex with him.

16:11.941 --> 16:13.092
You sucked his dick.

16:13.192 --> 16:14.260
We went out a few times.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.012
We never had sex,
but we fooled around.

16:16.112 --> 16:17.263
Oh, my God.

16:17.363 --> 16:19.390
Why'd you tell me you had sex
with three guys?

16:19.490 --> 16:21.934
Because I did only have sex
with three different guys.

16:22.034 --> 16:23.728
That doesn't mean
I didn't go with people.

16:23.828 --> 16:25.188
Oh, my God, I feel so nauseous.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.774
I'm sorry, Dante.
I thought you understood.

16:27.874 --> 16:29.108
I did understand.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.986
I understood that you had sex with
three guys and that's all you said.

16:32.086 --> 16:33.780
- Please calm down.
- How many?

16:33.880 --> 16:35.740
- Dante...
- How many dicks have you sucked?

16:35.840 --> 16:38.284
- How many?
- All right. Shut up and I'll tell you.

16:38.384 --> 16:41.370
Jesus. I didn't freak out when you
told me how many girls you fucked.

16:41.470 --> 16:44.215
This is different. This is important.
How many?

16:55.018 --> 16:56.811
Well?

16:58.855 --> 17:01.140
Something like 36.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.726
- What? Something like 36?
- Lower your voice.

17:03.826 --> 17:05.853
What is that anyway,
"Something like 36"?

17:05.953 --> 17:08.321
Does that include me?

17:09.825 --> 17:11.651
- Thirty-seven.
- I'm 37?

17:11.751 --> 17:15.154
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

17:15.253 --> 17:17.990
Thirty-seven?
My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.660
- In a row?
- Hey, where are you going?

17:20.760 --> 17:23.663
Until today you never even knew
how many guys I'd slept with

17:23.762 --> 17:25.455
because you never even bothered
to ask.

17:25.556 --> 17:27.666
Then you act all nonchalant
about fucking 12 girls.

17:27.767 --> 17:30.670
- I never had sex with 12 different guys.
- No, but you sucked enough dick.

17:30.770 --> 17:32.713
- Yeah, I went down on a few guys.
- A few?

17:32.813 --> 17:34.006
And one of those guys was you.

17:34.106 --> 17:37.051
The last one, I might add, which,
if you're too stupid to comprehend,

17:37.151 --> 17:39.220
means I've been faithful to you
since we met.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.556
All the other guys I went with
before I met you.

17:41.656 --> 17:43.140
If you wanna have a complex,
go ahead.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.433
But don't look at me like a town whore

17:44.533 --> 17:46.519
because you were busy
before you met me.

17:46.619 --> 17:48.187
Why did you have to suck their dick?

17:48.287 --> 17:50.356
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any decent person?

17:50.456 --> 17:52.191
Because going down isn't a big deal.

17:52.291 --> 17:55.236
I used to like a guy, we'd make out,
and sooner or later, I'd go down on him.

17:55.336 --> 17:57.405
But I only had sex with the guys I loved.

17:57.505 --> 18:00.199
- I feel sick.
- I love you. Don't feel sick.

18:00.299 --> 18:02.702
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

18:02.802 --> 18:05.413
I'm going to school. Maybe later
you'll be a bit more rational.

18:05.513 --> 18:08.507
- Thirty-seven. I just can't...
- Goodbye, Dante.

18:10.844 --> 18:14.881
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on your way through the parking lot.

18:14.981 --> 18:17.224
Hey, hey, you. Get back here.

18:22.564 --> 18:26.058
I thought that place was supposed
to be opened at 11 :00.

18:26.158 --> 18:27.393
It's 11 :20.

18:27.493 --> 18:30.938
I've already called his house twice.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

18:31.038 --> 18:34.525
Hey. It's not like it's a demanding job
over there.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.236
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

18:37.336 --> 18:39.906
I walked in here the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

18:40.006 --> 18:42.950
- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?

18:43.050 --> 18:46.829
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, he was probably resting his eyes.

18:46.929 --> 18:49.165
What the hell is that,
"Resting his eyes"?

18:49.265 --> 18:51.083
What, like he's some
air traffic controller?

18:51.183 --> 18:53.252
Actually, that's his night job.

18:53.352 --> 18:56.839
Wiseass too, huh?
Go ahead, keep cracking wise.

18:56.939 --> 18:59.800
That's why you're jockeying a register
in some local convenience store

18:59.900 --> 19:02.428
instead of working at a steady job.

19:02.528 --> 19:06.515
Look, I've got no time to bullshit around
here waiting for that son of a bitch.

19:06.615 --> 19:08.559
Make sure he gets that.

19:08.659 --> 19:11.520
The number's 812.
My name's Wynarski.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.105
And I wanted a movie tonight.

19:13.205 --> 19:15.650
If you'll tell me the title,
I'm sure he'll hold it for you.

19:15.750 --> 19:19.703
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.627
You forgot your keys.

19:39.224 --> 19:42.176
- Guy ain't here yet.
- You're kidding. It's almost 11 :30.

19:42.276 --> 19:44.470
I know. I've been here since 11 :00.

19:44.570 --> 19:47.014
Man, I hate it when I can't rent videos.

19:47.114 --> 19:48.224
I would've went to Big Choice,

19:48.324 --> 19:50.393
but the tape I want
is right there on that wall.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.478
- Really? Which one?
- Dental School.

19:52.578 --> 19:54.947
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

19:55.073 --> 19:56.983
- I have first dibs.
- Says who?

19:57.083 --> 20:00.194
Says me. I've been here for
half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.

20:00.294 --> 20:02.655
Ain't gonna happen, my friend.
I'm getting that movie.

20:02.755 --> 20:04.031
Like hell you are.

20:04.131 --> 20:06.867
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.494
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.

20:08.594 --> 20:10.838
All right, asshole, you're on.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.058
- You're late.
- What the hell are you doing here?

20:31.158 --> 20:32.309
I thought you were playing hockey.

20:32.409 --> 20:35.229
- Boss called. Arthur fell ill.
- Why the shutters closed?

20:35.329 --> 20:38.065
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

20:38.165 --> 20:39.191
That's what I said.

20:39.291 --> 20:42.528
Shit, if I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

20:42.628 --> 20:45.456
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Go open the store.

20:49.377 --> 20:51.412
Hey, you see a set of keys
around here?

20:51.512 --> 20:53.881
No time for love, Dr Jones.

20:55.467 --> 20:56.967
Fucking kids.

21:19.407 --> 21:21.734
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

21:21.834 --> 21:24.236
He said the store was closed
for two hours yesterday.

21:24.336 --> 21:27.073
- I tore up his membership.
- A shocking abuse of authority.

21:27.173 --> 21:29.909
Hey, I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class.

21:30.009 --> 21:31.335
Especially since I rule.

21:32.045 --> 21:33.913
You want something to drink?
I'm buying.

21:34.013 --> 21:35.414
No, thanks.

21:35.514 --> 21:37.625
Who's on your phone this morning
at 2:30?

21:37.725 --> 21:39.919
- I was trying to call for a half an hour.
- Why?

21:40.019 --> 21:43.305
I wanted to use your car. Snack cake.

21:44.974 --> 21:46.759
- You don't wanna know.
- You called Caitlin again?

21:46.859 --> 21:48.552
- She called me.
- Did you tell Veronica?

21:48.652 --> 21:51.180
One fight a day with Veronica
is all I can stomach. Thanks.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.016
- What do you fight about?
- We don't fight about anything.

21:54.116 --> 21:57.061
She just wants me to leave and go back
to school and get some direction.

21:57.161 --> 21:59.772
I'll bet the most frequent topic
of arguments is Caitlin Bree.

21:59.872 --> 22:02.241
- You win.
- I'm gonna offer you some advice.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.743
Let the past be the past.
Forget Caitlin Bree.

22:04.869 --> 22:07.071
- Been with Veronica how long now?
- Seven months.

22:07.171 --> 22:09.573
Chick's nuts about you.
How long did you date Caitlin?

22:09.673 --> 22:11.742
- Five years.
- Chick only made you nuts, man.

22:11.842 --> 22:14.120
- She cheated on you how many times?
- Eight and a half.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.622
- Eight and a half?
- Party at John Kay's, senior year.

22:16.722 --> 22:18.415
I get blitzed,
passed out in his bedroom.

22:18.515 --> 22:20.000
Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.753
- So that's cheating?
- In the middle, she called me "Brad."

22:22.853 --> 22:24.880
- She called you "Brad"?
- She called me "Brad."

22:24.980 --> 22:27.675
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

22:27.775 --> 22:31.178
- One time, I called this girl "Mom."
- I hit the lights and she freaks.

22:31.278 --> 22:33.472
- She thought I was Brad Michelson.
- What do you mean?

22:33.572 --> 22:35.558
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a bedroom.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.977
She picked the wrong one.
She didn't know I was at the party.

22:38.077 --> 22:39.478
- Oh, my God.
- Great story, huh?

22:39.578 --> 22:42.189
- That girl was vile to you.
- Interesting postscript to that.

22:42.289 --> 22:44.483
Do you know who wound up
in that bedroom with Brad?

22:44.583 --> 22:46.152
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.

22:46.252 --> 22:47.820
Chess team Alan Harris?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.905
The two moved to Idaho together
after graduation.

22:50.005 --> 22:51.740
- They raise sheep.
- That's frightening.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.409
It takes different strokes
to move the world.

22:53.509 --> 22:54.668
In light of this lurid tale,

22:54.794 --> 22:57.496
I don't see how you'd romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

22:57.596 --> 23:00.082
Broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

23:00.182 --> 23:02.084
- There's good in our relationship.
- Oh, yeah?

23:02.184 --> 23:04.136
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

23:04.262 --> 23:06.046
I mean, that's what high school
is about.

23:06.146 --> 23:08.007
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

23:08.107 --> 23:09.884
You think things will be different
this time?

23:09.984 --> 23:12.678
They are. When she calls me now,
she's a different person.

23:12.778 --> 23:14.180
She's frightened, vulnerable.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.891
She's finishing college
and she's about to enter the real world.

23:16.991 --> 23:19.351
- That's scary.
- I've got to place an order.

23:19.451 --> 23:20.519
I'm talking to myself here.

23:20.619 --> 23:22.438
I'm listening.
She's leaving college and...

23:22.538 --> 23:24.106
And she's looking to me for support.

23:24.206 --> 23:26.233
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.568
And what about Veronica?

23:27.668 --> 23:30.571
I think the arguments we are having
are some kind of manifestation

23:30.671 --> 23:32.615
of a subconscious desire
to break up with her

23:32.715 --> 23:34.909
so I can pursue a more meaningful
relationship with Caitlin.

23:35.009 --> 23:37.961
- And Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
- I think it's safe to say yes.

23:38.129 --> 23:40.289
All of you had better sit down
and talk it over.

23:40.389 --> 23:43.083
- All four?
- You, Veronica, Caitlin,

23:43.183 --> 23:44.635
and Caitlin's fiancÃ©.

23:55.271 --> 23:57.431
Excuse me. Do you sell video tapes?

23:57.531 --> 24:00.809
- Yeah. What are you looking for?
- Happy Scrappy, Hero Pup?

24:00.909 --> 24:03.395
One second. I'm on the phone
with the distribution house now.

24:03.495 --> 24:05.231
- Let me make sure they got it.
- Okay.

24:05.331 --> 24:06.440
What's it called again?

24:06.540 --> 24:09.068
- Happy Scrappy, Hero Pup.
- Happy Scrappy.

24:09.168 --> 24:11.161
- She loves it.
- Obviously.

24:12.330 --> 24:16.533
Yeah. Hi, this is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

24:16.633 --> 24:18.710
I'd like to place an order.

24:18.836 --> 24:21.038
Okay.
I need one each of the following tapes,

24:21.138 --> 24:23.290
Whispers in the Wind,
To Each His Own,

24:23.390 --> 24:26.460
Put It Where It Doesn't Belong,
My Pipes Need Cleaning,

24:26.560 --> 24:29.755
All Tit Fucking, Volume 8,
I Need Your Cock,

24:29.855 --> 24:33.350
Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers,
My Cunt and Eight Shafts,

24:33.476 --> 24:37.721
Cum Clean, Cum Gargling
Naked Sluts, Cum Buns III,

24:37.821 --> 24:40.432
Cumming in Socks, Come on Ilene,

24:40.532 --> 24:42.601
Huge Black Cocks
With Pearly White Cum,

24:42.701 --> 24:45.570
Girls Who Crave Cock,
Girls Who Crave Cunt,

24:45.697 --> 24:49.608
Men Alone II, The KY Connection,
Pink Pussy Lips.

24:49.708 --> 24:53.287
Oh, yeah and All Holes Filled
With Hard Cock. Yup.

24:54.205 --> 24:56.665
Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

25:17.520 --> 25:20.472
Yes, I'd like to check
on a misprint in today's edition?

25:20.572 --> 25:22.349
Today's edition.

25:22.449 --> 25:25.444
It says
"Bree to wed Asian design major."

25:26.696 --> 25:28.147
No, no, everything's spelled fine.

25:28.247 --> 25:31.692
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.036
I don't know. Like a typographical error
or something?

25:34.370 --> 25:36.322
I don't know.
Maybe it should say "Caitlin Bray"

25:36.422 --> 25:38.749
or "Caitlin Bre" with one E.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.461
I'm a curious party. A curious party.

25:44.339 --> 25:47.833
I'm an ex-boyfriend and, well,
it's just that I talk to her all the time

25:47.933 --> 25:49.418
and she never mentioned
this engagement.

25:49.518 --> 25:52.429
That's why I'm thinking,
maybe it's a misprint.

25:54.098 --> 25:55.758
Are you sure?

25:55.858 --> 25:59.386
I mean, maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

25:59.486 --> 26:00.721
Meaning, like, I don't know,

26:00.821 --> 26:03.182
someone who asked her out once
and got shot down.

26:03.282 --> 26:06.151
And this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper

26:06.277 --> 26:08.187
when it went to the press.

26:08.287 --> 26:09.905
Hello? Hello?

26:19.540 --> 26:20.824
I don't care if she's my cousin or not,

26:20.924 --> 26:23.369
I'm gonna knock
those boots again tonight.

26:23.469 --> 26:25.621
Well, look who it is,
the fucking human vacuum.

26:25.721 --> 26:26.997
Scumbag, what are you doing?

26:27.097 --> 26:28.874
I'm hanging with Silent Bob
and his cousin.

26:28.974 --> 26:30.084
He's your cousin?

26:30.184 --> 26:33.470
- Yeah, and he's from Russia too.
- No way. What part of Russia?

26:33.596 --> 26:35.964
I don't fucking know.
Do I look like his fucking biographer?

26:36.064 --> 26:39.218
Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?

26:39.318 --> 26:41.720
- Moscow.
- He only speaks Russian?

26:41.820 --> 26:44.431
No, he speaks some English,
but he cannot speak it like we do.

26:44.531 --> 26:45.599
Is he staying here?

26:45.699 --> 26:47.393
No, he's moving
to the big city this week.

26:47.493 --> 26:49.812
- He wants to be a metal singer.
- No way.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.988
I swear. Olaf, metal.

26:52.824 --> 26:56.451
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

26:57.620 --> 27:00.280
- That's fucked up, man.
- What did he say?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.624
I don't know, man,
but this guy's a character.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.034
He really wants to play metal?

27:04.134 --> 27:05.619
Yeah. He's got his own band
in Moscow.

27:05.719 --> 27:07.162
It's called
Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans

27:07.262 --> 27:08.414
or something like that.

27:08.514 --> 27:10.541
- Doesn't sound metal.
- You gotta hear him sing.

27:10.641 --> 27:12.835
Olaf, "Berserker."

27:12.935 --> 27:14.920
Come on, man, "Berserker."

27:15.020 --> 27:16.630
Does he sing in English or Russian?

27:16.730 --> 27:20.851
In English. Come on, "Berserker."
Girls think sexy.

27:22.228 --> 27:25.013
Watch, wait, he's gonna sing it.
Watch, it's too funny.

27:25.113 --> 27:29.643
My love for you is like a truck
Berserker

27:29.743 --> 27:33.772
Would you like some making fuck
Berserker

27:33.872 --> 27:36.867
- That's fucking funny, man.
- Did he sing "Making fuck"?

27:57.597 --> 28:02.134
My love for you is ticking clock
Berserker

28:02.234 --> 28:06.271
Would you like to suck my cock
Berserker

28:07.648 --> 28:09.566
That's beautiful, man.

28:14.447 --> 28:16.899
Hold on to the counter and I'll pull.

28:16.999 --> 28:20.152
Usually I just turn the can upside down.

28:20.252 --> 28:22.488
Maybe we ought to soap your hand up.

28:22.588 --> 28:24.456
They ought to put a warning
on these things.

28:24.582 --> 28:26.833
- Like they do with cigarettes.
- Oh, I think it's coming.

28:31.088 --> 28:34.333
Thanks.
I thought I had to go to the hospital.

28:34.433 --> 28:37.419
I'll throw this out
as a precautionary measure.

28:37.519 --> 28:39.087
It stings a little.

28:39.187 --> 28:40.756
A little word of advice, my friend.

28:40.856 --> 28:44.176
Sometimes you gotta let
those hard to reach chips go.

28:44.276 --> 28:45.602
Thanks.

28:47.271 --> 28:50.516
You know that article's accurate?
Caitlin really is getting married.

28:50.616 --> 28:51.683
Know what I just watched?

28:51.783 --> 28:53.435
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?

28:53.535 --> 28:55.187
Return of the Jedi.

28:55.287 --> 28:58.524
Didn't you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.

28:58.624 --> 29:02.277
Which did you like better,
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?

29:02.377 --> 29:04.454
- Empire.
- Blasphemy.

29:05.581 --> 29:06.865
Empire had the better ending.

29:06.965 --> 29:11.036
I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

29:11.136 --> 29:13.080
Han gets frozen,
taken away by Boba Fett.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.373
It ends on such a down note.

29:14.473 --> 29:18.168
I mean, that's what life is,
a series of down endings.

29:18.268 --> 29:20.420
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.214
There was something else
going on in Jedi.

29:22.314 --> 29:23.966
I never noticed it until today.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.051
- They build another Death Star, right?
- Yeah.

29:26.151 --> 29:28.303
Now, the first one was completed
and fully operational

29:28.403 --> 29:29.763
before the Rebels destroyed it.

29:29.863 --> 29:31.682
Luke blew it up.
Give credit where credit's due.

29:31.782 --> 29:33.976
Second one was still being built
when they blew it up.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.602
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

29:35.702 --> 29:38.397
Something just never sat right with me
that second time around.

29:38.497 --> 29:39.731
I could never put my finger on it.

29:39.831 --> 29:42.401
- But something just wasn't right.
- And you figured it out.

29:42.501 --> 29:45.112
The first Death Star was manned
by the Imperial Army.

29:45.212 --> 29:47.072
The only people onboard
were stormtroopers,

29:47.172 --> 29:49.992
- dignitaries, Imperials.
- Basically.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.744
So when they blew it up,
no problem, evil is punished.

29:52.844 --> 29:53.912
And the second time around?

29:54.012 --> 29:56.290
The second time around,
it wasn't even done being built yet.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.584
- It was still under construction.
- So?

29:58.684 --> 30:01.128
So a construction job of that magnitude
would require

30:01.228 --> 30:04.172
a hell of a lot more manpower
than the Imperial Army had to offer.

30:04.272 --> 30:07.050
I'll bet they brought independent
contractors in on that thing.

30:07.150 --> 30:09.761
- Plumbers, aluminium-siders, roofers...
- Not just Imperialists.

30:09.861 --> 30:11.263
- Is that what you're getting at?
- Exactly.

30:11.363 --> 30:15.100
To get it built quickly and quietly,
they'd hire anybody that can do the job.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.603
Think the average stormtrooper
knows how to install a toilet main?

30:17.703 --> 30:19.896
All they know is killing
and white uniforms.

30:19.996 --> 30:22.399
All right, so they bring in
independent contractors.

30:22.499 --> 30:24.234
Why are you so upset
at its destruction?

30:24.334 --> 30:27.454
All those innocent contractors
brought in to do the job were killed.

30:27.622 --> 30:29.456
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

30:30.416 --> 30:32.284
All right, look. You're a roofer.

30:32.384 --> 30:34.711
Some juicy government contract
comes your way,

30:34.837 --> 30:37.497
you got a wife and kids,
the two-storey in suburbia.

30:37.597 --> 30:40.792
This is a government contract,
which means all sorts of benefits.

30:40.892 --> 30:42.294
Along come these left-wing militants

30:42.394 --> 30:45.130
that blast everything
within a 3-mile radius with their lasers.

30:45.230 --> 30:47.507
You did not ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

30:47.607 --> 30:49.468
You're trying to scrape out a living.

30:49.568 --> 30:51.970
I don't mean to interrupt,
but what are you talking about?

30:52.070 --> 30:53.639
The ending of Return of the Jedi.

30:53.739 --> 30:56.516
My friend is trying to convince me
that any independent contractors

30:56.616 --> 30:58.518
who were working
on the uncompleted Death Star

30:58.618 --> 31:01.104
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed by the Rebels.

31:01.204 --> 31:03.815
Well, I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

31:03.915 --> 31:07.277
Done and Ready Home Improvements.
And speaking as a roofer,

31:07.377 --> 31:11.156
I can tell you a roofer's personal politics
comes into play when choosing jobs.

31:11.256 --> 31:12.324
Like when?

31:12.424 --> 31:14.576
Three weeks ago,
I was offered a job up in the hills.

31:14.676 --> 31:18.747
A beautiful house. Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

31:18.847 --> 31:22.793
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

31:22.893 --> 31:25.712
- Then I realised whose house it was.
- Whose house was it?

31:25.812 --> 31:29.800
- Dominic Bambino's.
- "Baby Face" Bambino? The gangster?

31:29.900 --> 31:33.512
The same. The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

31:33.612 --> 31:37.683
I knew who he was and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend of mine.

31:37.783 --> 31:39.651
Based on personal politics.

31:39.777 --> 31:42.187
Right. And the next week
the Forsie family

31:42.287 --> 31:44.523
put a hit on Baby Face's house.

31:44.623 --> 31:47.984
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

31:48.084 --> 31:49.111
No way.

31:49.211 --> 31:53.281
I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

31:53.381 --> 31:55.367
My friend wasn't so lucky.

31:55.467 --> 31:59.371
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

31:59.471 --> 32:02.457
If they got killed, it's their own fault.

32:02.557 --> 32:05.343
A roofer listens to this, not his wallet.

32:16.522 --> 32:19.649
They say so much,
but they never tell you if it's any good.

32:22.987 --> 32:25.488
Are either one of these any good?

32:26.282 --> 32:28.275
- Sir?
- What?

32:28.375 --> 32:31.703
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don't watch movies.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.532
Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

32:35.632 --> 32:38.785
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

32:38.885 --> 32:42.998
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

32:43.098 --> 32:44.507
Nope.

32:49.096 --> 32:52.015
- Well, what about these two?
- Oh, they suck.

32:53.184 --> 32:57.512
These are the same two movies.
You weren't paying any attention.

32:57.612 --> 32:59.598
No, I wasn't.

32:59.698 --> 33:01.600
I don't think your manager
would appreciate it...

33:01.700 --> 33:04.978
- I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon?

33:05.078 --> 33:07.989
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

33:08.866 --> 33:10.484
I was only pointing out

33:10.584 --> 33:12.944
that you weren't paying any attention
to what I was saying.

33:13.044 --> 33:16.490
- And I hope it feels good.
- You hope what feels good?

33:16.590 --> 33:19.785
I hope it feels so good to be right.
There's nothing more exhilarating

33:19.885 --> 33:23.705
than pointing out the shortcomings
of others, is there?

33:23.805 --> 33:27.375
- Well, this is the last time I rent here.
- You'll be missed.

33:27.475 --> 33:28.927
Screw you.

33:31.472 --> 33:33.548
Hey, you're not allowed
to rent here any more.

33:33.648 --> 33:35.967
Yeah!

33:36.067 --> 33:37.352
Screw me?

33:50.908 --> 33:53.409
You'll never believe
what this unruly customer just said.

33:53.536 --> 33:55.153
- Wait.
- She in here?

33:55.253 --> 33:57.697
This guy is going through all the eggs.
Look.

33:57.797 --> 33:59.491
This has been going on for 20 minutes.

33:59.591 --> 34:00.909
What's he looking for?

34:01.009 --> 34:03.537
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.
- Perfect dozen?

34:03.637 --> 34:05.705
Yeah. Each egg has to be perfect.

34:05.805 --> 34:07.833
- The quest isn't going well, huh?
- Obviously not.

34:07.933 --> 34:09.708
Look at the cartons
that didn't make the grade.

34:09.809 --> 34:11.335
Why doesn't he mix and match?

34:11.436 --> 34:13.964
- I told him and he yelled at me.
- What did he say?

34:14.063 --> 34:15.715
He said it was important
to have standards.

34:15.815 --> 34:19.427
- He said nobody has pride any more.
- It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.

34:19.527 --> 34:22.054
Five minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

34:22.155 --> 34:25.775
I don't need this. I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

34:27.110 --> 34:29.237
Two packs of cigarettes.

34:31.782 --> 34:33.567
I'm as puzzled as you.

34:33.667 --> 34:36.277
- I've actually seen it before.
- You know him?

34:36.378 --> 34:38.237
I don't know him,
but I know the behaviour.

34:38.338 --> 34:41.616
- Looking for the perfect carton of eggs?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

34:41.716 --> 34:44.119
And I'll bet you a million dollars
he's a guidance counsellor.

34:44.219 --> 34:45.370
Why do you say that?

34:45.469 --> 34:48.005
Well, I saw it happen
in Food City, like, last year.

34:48.132 --> 34:49.456
Different guy though.

34:49.556 --> 34:50.625
Stock boy said that he'd been

34:50.725 --> 34:52.385
looking through cartons of eggs
for half an hour,

34:52.511 --> 34:55.130
doing all sorts of endurance tests
and stuff.

34:55.230 --> 34:56.848
I ask them why nobody
ever called the manager,

34:56.974 --> 34:59.809
and he said it happens, like, two,
three times a week, sometimes more.

34:59.935 --> 35:01.811
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.

35:01.979 --> 35:03.388
They call it shell shock.

35:03.488 --> 35:05.473
Seems to only happens
with guidance counsellors.

35:05.573 --> 35:08.268
They used to make a big deal of it,
but they let it go

35:08.368 --> 35:10.061
because they always
pay for whatever they break

35:10.161 --> 35:11.646
and they never bother anybody.

35:11.746 --> 35:13.356
Why guidance counsellors?

35:13.456 --> 35:16.818
Well, if your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

35:16.918 --> 35:19.779
Come to think of it, my guidance
counsellor was kind of worthless.

35:19.879 --> 35:22.741
See? It's important to have a job
that makes a difference, boys.

35:22.841 --> 35:25.201
That's why I manually masturbate
caged animals

35:25.301 --> 35:27.086
for artificial insemination.

36:02.790 --> 36:06.451
You ever notice that all the prices
end in nine?

36:06.551 --> 36:08.453
Damn, that's eerie.

36:08.553 --> 36:11.089
You know how much money the
average jizz-mopper makes per hour?

36:11.215 --> 36:12.499
What's a jizz-mopper?

36:12.599 --> 36:15.627
The guy that cleans out the nudie booth
after each guy jerks off.

36:15.727 --> 36:17.963
- "Nudie booth"?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

36:18.063 --> 36:20.382
- Never been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.800
Oh, man, it's great.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.011
You go to this booth and there's this
glass between you and these chicks

36:25.111 --> 36:27.305
and they put on a show for you for like
for, like, 10 bucks.

36:27.405 --> 36:28.515
What kind of a show?

36:28.615 --> 36:31.559
Think of the weirdest,
craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.

36:31.659 --> 36:32.944
I mean, these chicks do it all.

36:33.070 --> 36:36.564
They insert things into any opening
on their body. Any opening.

36:36.664 --> 36:37.732
Can we not talk about this now?

36:37.832 --> 36:40.902
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

36:41.002 --> 36:44.322
Everybody does it right on the window.
I don't know if you noticed,

36:44.422 --> 36:46.449
but cum leaves streaks
if you don't clean it right away.

36:46.549 --> 36:49.744
- I will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me?

36:49.844 --> 36:51.913
Using filthy language
in front of the customers.

36:52.013 --> 36:53.790
You both should be fired.

36:53.890 --> 36:57.210
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kind of got carried away.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.005
Well, I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

37:00.105 --> 37:02.140
You've highly offended me.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.936
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.389
I think you can see her kidneys.

37:09.489 --> 37:11.057
Why do you do things like that?

37:11.157 --> 37:13.059
You know he's gonna come back
and tell the boss.

37:13.159 --> 37:14.853
Who cares? That guy's an asshole.

37:14.953 --> 37:17.188
Everybody that comes in here
is way too uptight.

37:17.288 --> 37:19.524
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the customers.

37:19.624 --> 37:21.359
I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.

37:21.459 --> 37:22.986
Oh, would you loosen up?

37:23.086 --> 37:24.195
You'd feel a hell of a lot better

37:24.295 --> 37:26.489
if you'd rip into
the occasional customer.

37:26.589 --> 37:29.292
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

37:29.418 --> 37:31.369
Liar. Tell me there aren't customers

37:31.469 --> 37:34.039
that annoy the piss out of you
on a daily basis.

37:34.139 --> 37:36.458
- There aren't.
- How can you lie like that?

37:36.558 --> 37:39.377
Why don't you vent?
Vent your frustrations.

37:39.477 --> 37:42.138
Come on. Who pisses you off?

37:42.598 --> 37:46.384
Well, I guess it isn't customers
in particular.

37:46.484 --> 37:48.678
Maybe just a group of customers.

37:48.778 --> 37:52.482
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the milkmaids.

37:53.484 --> 37:55.359
The milkmaids?

37:55.486 --> 37:59.022
The women that go through every
gallon of milk looking for that later date

37:59.122 --> 38:01.232
as if somewhere beyond
all the other gallons

38:01.332 --> 38:04.869
is a container of milk that won't go bad
for, like, a decade.

38:05.829 --> 38:07.113
You know who I can do without?

38:07.213 --> 38:09.324
I could do without the people
in the video store.

38:09.424 --> 38:11.785
- Which ones?
- All of them.

38:11.885 --> 38:15.171
What would you get for a 6-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

38:15.547 --> 38:17.090
So do you have any new movies in?

38:18.509 --> 38:20.085
Do you have that one with that guy

38:20.185 --> 38:23.054
who was in that movie
that was out last year?

38:23.180 --> 38:24.756
They never rent quality flicks.

38:24.856 --> 38:27.892
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

38:29.019 --> 38:30.929
Navy Seals.

38:31.029 --> 38:34.349
It's like in order to join, they have
to have an IQ less than their shoe size.

38:34.449 --> 38:35.809
Think you get stupid questions?

38:35.909 --> 38:38.353
You should hear the barrage
of stupid questions I get.

38:38.453 --> 38:41.231
What, there's no ice?
I gotta drink this coffee hot?

38:41.331 --> 38:43.032
So how much is this thing anyway?

38:46.745 --> 38:49.280
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

38:49.380 --> 38:51.207
Oh, Mini Truckin' magazine.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.960
See? You vented. Don't you feel better?

38:54.086 --> 38:55.620
- No.
- Why not?

38:55.720 --> 38:57.705
Because my ex-girlfriend's
getting married.

38:57.805 --> 39:01.626
Jesus, you got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

39:01.726 --> 39:03.302
Veronica.

39:05.055 --> 39:07.173
What happened to home by 12:00?

39:07.273 --> 39:09.467
Boss hasn't shown up yet.
How come you're not in class?

39:09.567 --> 39:13.012
Lit 101 got cancelled so I stopped home
and I brought you some lunch.

39:13.112 --> 39:14.305
What is it?

39:14.405 --> 39:16.683
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

39:16.783 --> 39:20.520
- What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
- Really?

39:20.620 --> 39:22.772
Oh, you're the queen.

39:22.872 --> 39:25.775
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

39:25.875 --> 39:27.743
- Thirty-seven.
- Shut up.

39:29.246 --> 39:33.416
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

39:34.334 --> 39:37.086
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

39:41.258 --> 39:42.375
You had to tell him?

39:42.475 --> 39:44.794
I had to tell someone.
He put it into perspective.

39:44.894 --> 39:47.714
- What did he say?
- He said at least he wasn't 36.

39:47.814 --> 39:49.340
And that made you feel better?

39:49.440 --> 39:51.676
And he also said
that most of them were college guys

39:51.776 --> 39:53.094
I've never even seen or met before.

39:53.194 --> 39:56.181
- Ostrich syndrome. If you don't see it...
- It isn't there, yes.

39:56.281 --> 39:59.684
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagne.

39:59.784 --> 40:02.562
- Couldn't get the shutters open?
- No. I called a locksmith.

40:02.662 --> 40:04.731
He said the earliest he could be here's
tomorrow morning.

40:04.831 --> 40:07.525
Bummer. Well, I've gotta
head back for the 1 :30 class.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.152
- What time do you get finished?
- Eight.

40:09.252 --> 40:13.072
But I have a sorority meeting till 9:00,
so I'll see you when you close, then.

40:13.172 --> 40:14.574
- Can we go out for coffee?
- Sure.

40:14.674 --> 40:16.492
Good.

40:16.592 --> 40:19.962
I'll see you when you close, then.
Enjoy the lasagne.

40:36.313 --> 40:38.306
Vermont?

40:38.406 --> 40:41.851
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

40:41.951 --> 40:43.945
He left at what time?

40:44.655 --> 40:46.731
He really went to Vermont?

40:46.831 --> 40:48.775
When the hell
was someone gonna tell me?

40:48.875 --> 40:51.486
He promised me he'd be here by noon.

40:51.586 --> 40:53.738
Jesus. When does he get back?

40:53.838 --> 40:57.200
Tuesday? You gotta be kidding me.
I've got a hockey game at 2:00

40:57.300 --> 40:59.702
and the steel shutters are
jammed closed and he's in Vermont?

40:59.802 --> 41:02.421
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

41:05.842 --> 41:08.336
So I'm stuck here until closing?

41:08.436 --> 41:10.546
Oh, this is just great.

41:10.646 --> 41:13.099
I can't fucking believe this.

41:14.434 --> 41:17.687
No. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell at you.

41:19.106 --> 41:20.606
Yeah, I know.

41:21.984 --> 41:23.859
No, I'll be all right.

41:25.362 --> 41:29.448
Well, that's all I can do, right? Yeah.
All right, thanks. Bye.

41:30.367 --> 41:32.610
- Vermont?
- Can you fucking believe this?

41:32.710 --> 41:33.987
He didn't mention that
to you this morning?

41:34.087 --> 41:36.656
Not a word.
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

41:36.756 --> 41:39.117
- So, what, you're stuck here all day?
- Fuck!

41:39.217 --> 41:40.952
- Why'd you apologise?
- What?

41:41.052 --> 41:42.370
I heard you apologise. Why?

41:42.470 --> 41:44.789
- You have every reason to be mad.
- I know.

41:44.889 --> 41:48.584
Jesus. That seems to be the leitmotif
in your life, ever backing down.

41:48.684 --> 41:50.670
- I don't back down.
- You always back down.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.506
You assume blame that's not yours,
you come in on your day off,

41:53.606 --> 41:54.841
you buckle like a belt.

41:54.941 --> 41:57.719
- Know what pisses me off?
- That I'm right about your buckling?

41:57.819 --> 42:00.263
- That I'm gonna miss the fucking game.
- Because you buckled.

42:00.363 --> 42:03.808
- Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping.
- Don't yell at me, pal.

42:03.908 --> 42:05.935
- I'm sorry.
- See? There you go again.

42:06.035 --> 42:08.104
I can't believe
I'm gonna miss the game.

42:08.204 --> 42:10.023
At least we're stuck here together.

42:10.123 --> 42:11.866
You got a customer.

42:12.576 --> 42:14.535
What? What do you want?

42:19.416 --> 42:21.792
Oh, I can't fucking believe this.

42:22.586 --> 42:24.754
Yeah, hello, Sanford? Dante.

42:25.589 --> 42:28.966
I can't play today. I'm stuck at work.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.304
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled,
but I just... Forget it.

42:33.805 --> 42:37.933
Point is I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

42:39.644 --> 42:42.938
Hey, wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

42:43.732 --> 42:46.150
Hold on. You feeling limber?

42:56.912 --> 42:59.530
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
- I've gotta tell you, my friend.

42:59.630 --> 43:01.949
This is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

43:02.049 --> 43:05.119
I never thought you capable of such
a blatant disregard of store policy.

43:05.219 --> 43:07.080
I told him I had a game today.
It's his own fault.

43:07.180 --> 43:09.040
No arguments here.
Insubordination rules.

43:09.140 --> 43:11.209
I want to play hockey
like I was scheduled to.

43:11.309 --> 43:12.877
Hey, I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

43:12.977 --> 43:14.879
If you grab a Gatorade,
everybody's gonna grab one.

43:14.979 --> 43:16.839
- So?
- So? Who's gonna pay?

43:16.939 --> 43:18.925
What do you care,
shoe-polish-smelling motherfucker?

43:19.025 --> 43:22.261
I have responsibility.
I can't have everybody grab free drinks.

43:22.361 --> 43:24.806
What responsibility? You're closing
the fucking store to play hockey.

43:24.906 --> 43:26.015
He's got a point.

43:26.115 --> 43:28.434
Let me maintain some semblance
of managerial control.

43:28.534 --> 43:31.187
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
might as well go the full nine,

43:31.287 --> 43:32.897
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit to drink.

43:32.997 --> 43:35.316
Right. As if we're gonna have a run
on Gatorade.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.818
- Fucking-A.
- All right.

43:36.918 --> 43:38.569
Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.

43:38.669 --> 43:40.655
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

43:40.755 --> 43:42.407
- Design major.
- Can we not talk about this?

43:42.507 --> 43:46.494
Fine by me. But you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

43:46.594 --> 43:49.205
- You gonna lock the store?
- You gonna lock the video store?

43:49.305 --> 43:51.874
Look who you're asking.
How we gonna block the street?

43:51.974 --> 43:55.678
- We're not playing in the street.
- Then where we gonna play?

44:03.061 --> 44:04.645
Hit him, hit him, hit him.

44:10.652 --> 44:11.861
Hit him.

44:17.451 --> 44:19.743
Dante. Here, here, here.

44:21.872 --> 44:23.747
Now, wait a second...

44:23.915 --> 44:25.374
Hit him.

44:28.086 --> 44:29.503
That's it.

44:30.172 --> 44:33.048
I got him, I got him, I got him.
He's mine, mine, mine.

44:36.928 --> 44:39.722
Over here, back, back, back.
Come on, get it.

44:40.515 --> 44:42.300
- Clear the crease.
- Hit him.

44:42.400 --> 44:43.642
Yeah.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.105
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

44:48.273 --> 44:51.400
- Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up.
- To the left, to the left.

44:53.069 --> 44:54.361
Hit him.

44:56.531 --> 44:59.192
Get him. All right, here we go,
I got, I got it. I'm here.

44:59.292 --> 45:01.319
- When's this period over?
- Eight more minutes.

45:01.419 --> 45:03.404
Are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

45:03.504 --> 45:05.281
If you can just wait
a few minutes, okay?

45:05.381 --> 45:07.658
Fuck that. I'm gonna break
my neck on this ladder.

45:07.758 --> 45:10.620
Now lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.413
- Dante, where are you?
- He's busy.

45:12.513 --> 45:14.624
- In a second.
- Fuck in a second.

45:14.724 --> 45:17.919
- Look at you, you can't even pass.
- I can pass.

45:18.019 --> 45:20.171
How about covering the point?
Man, you suck.

45:20.271 --> 45:23.716
- Who are you to make assessments?
- Hey, I'll assess all I want, pal.

45:23.816 --> 45:26.844
- Hey, Dante, you in or out?
- Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

45:26.944 --> 45:28.596
- You suck.
- Like you're better.

45:28.696 --> 45:31.474
- I'll whip your ass any day, pal.
- That's easy to say from over here.

45:31.574 --> 45:33.184
Give me a stick.

45:33.284 --> 45:35.895
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass.

45:35.995 --> 45:38.648
- Hey, are you open?
- Yeah, are you open?

45:38.748 --> 45:39.990
- No.
- No.

45:41.785 --> 45:44.654
There's a stick over there.
You're shooting up against this goal.

45:44.754 --> 45:46.989
Hey, Redding, come off.
Let this fuck on.

45:47.089 --> 45:48.582
Face-off, right here.

45:59.928 --> 46:01.379
Oh, man. Nice hit.

46:01.479 --> 46:04.173
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, get it.

46:04.273 --> 46:06.976
Come on, come on.
Get him, get him, get him.

46:20.198 --> 46:22.032
Give me another ball.

46:22.492 --> 46:23.859
There are no more.

46:23.959 --> 46:26.070
The fuck you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

46:26.170 --> 46:29.498
I brought the orange one
and the orange one.

46:30.375 --> 46:31.867
Hey, any balls down there?

46:31.967 --> 46:35.337
About the biggest pair
you've ever seen, dingleberry.

46:36.548 --> 46:39.500
- You only brought one ball?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.

46:39.600 --> 46:40.918
Dante had the balls.

46:41.018 --> 46:43.345
- Nobody has another ball?
- Shit.

46:44.097 --> 46:47.592
We get, what, 12 minutes of a game
and then it's over?

46:47.692 --> 46:50.303
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

46:50.403 --> 46:53.022
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

46:54.524 --> 46:56.984
I still get free Gatorade, right?

47:08.246 --> 47:10.873
- Be careful.
- I'm trying.

47:11.458 --> 47:15.044
You know, the insides of those
has got stuff that can give you cancer.

47:15.170 --> 47:17.254
- So I'm told.
- Yeah.

47:17.797 --> 47:20.382
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living.

47:20.508 --> 47:21.709
At the circus.

47:21.809 --> 47:24.086
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent-bulb glass?

47:24.186 --> 47:26.347
No, got hit by a bus.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.183
Can I help you?

47:31.061 --> 47:33.304
Well, that depends.

47:33.404 --> 47:35.731
You got maybe a toilet in here?

47:36.107 --> 47:37.808
Yeah, but it's for employees only.

47:37.908 --> 47:42.154
I understand, but I thought maybe
you would let me use it anyway.

47:42.572 --> 47:43.689
I'm not so young any more.

47:43.789 --> 47:46.651
I am, how do you say,
a little incontinent.

47:46.751 --> 47:48.486
Sure, in the back. Through the cooler.

47:48.586 --> 47:50.412
Thank you, sonny boy.

48:01.049 --> 48:04.593
Say, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

48:05.095 --> 48:07.672
- The white kind.
- I didn't ask about the colour.

48:07.772 --> 48:11.058
I mean is it rough or is it cottony?

48:11.893 --> 48:14.720
- Actually, it's kind of rough.
- Oh, boy.

48:14.820 --> 48:18.015
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my haemorrhoids.

48:18.115 --> 48:21.352
I thought maybe you could let me have
a roll of the soft stuff.

48:21.452 --> 48:23.979
I see you sell the soft stuff back there.

48:24.079 --> 48:26.941
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, what's the difference?

48:27.041 --> 48:30.403
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

48:30.503 --> 48:32.029
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

48:32.129 --> 48:34.832
Thank you, sonny boy.
You're a lifesaver.

48:43.925 --> 48:45.876
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

48:45.976 --> 48:49.422
but maybe I could have
something in the back there.

48:49.522 --> 48:51.807
To read? A paper or something.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.634
Sometimes it takes me a while,

48:53.734 --> 48:57.146
and I like to have something to read
while it's going on.

48:57.981 --> 48:59.481
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

48:59.607 --> 49:01.600
One of the magazines
you got in the back over there.

49:01.700 --> 49:02.768
Behind the counter.

49:02.868 --> 49:05.195
- The porno mags?
- Yeah.

49:06.072 --> 49:08.065
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

49:08.165 --> 49:11.902
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

49:12.002 --> 49:14.989
No, not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

49:15.089 --> 49:17.158
They got bigger titties in there.

49:17.258 --> 49:18.743
Here. Now leave me alone.

49:18.843 --> 49:21.503
Thank you, sonny boy. I appreciate it.

49:25.842 --> 49:28.461
- Hell of a game.
- One ball.

49:28.561 --> 49:29.587
I close the store.

49:29.687 --> 49:31.630
They come all the way here
for one ball.

49:31.730 --> 49:33.758
Hockey's hockey.
At least we got to play.

49:33.858 --> 49:36.802
Twelve minutes is not a game.
Jesus, it's hardly even a warm up.

49:36.902 --> 49:39.096
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
You want something to drink?

49:39.196 --> 49:40.689
Yeah, Gatorade.

49:41.858 --> 49:43.517
Hey, what happened
to all the Gatorade?

49:43.617 --> 49:45.944
Exactly. They drank it all.

49:47.489 --> 49:50.399
- You know what Sanford told me?
- I can't believe Caitlin's getting married.

49:50.499 --> 49:52.109
- Julie Dwyer died.
- Yeah, right.

49:52.209 --> 49:54.570
- No, I'm serious.
- Oh, my God.

49:54.670 --> 49:57.239
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

49:57.339 --> 49:59.492
- How, when?
- Embolism in her brain, yesterday.

49:59.592 --> 50:00.618
Jesus.

50:00.718 --> 50:04.246
She was swimming when it happened.
She died in mid-backstroke.

50:04.346 --> 50:06.957
I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

50:07.057 --> 50:09.835
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wasn't she one of the illustrious 12?

50:09.935 --> 50:13.464
- Yeah, number six.
- You've had sex with a dead person.

50:13.564 --> 50:15.508
- I'm gonna go to her wake.
- No, you're not.

50:15.608 --> 50:16.926
- Why not?
- It's today.

50:17.026 --> 50:18.469
- What?
- Paulson's Funeral Parlour.

50:18.569 --> 50:20.971
- The next show is at 4:00.
- Shit, what about tomorrow?

50:21.071 --> 50:23.098
One night only.
She's buried in the morning.

50:23.198 --> 50:25.309
- Watch the store, I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

50:25.409 --> 50:27.736
Has it ever occurred to you
that I might be bereaved as well?

50:27.862 --> 50:28.979
You hardly knew her.

50:29.079 --> 50:31.398
True, but do you know
how many people are gonna be there?

50:31.498 --> 50:34.443
- All of our old classmates.
- Stop it, this is beneath even you.

50:34.543 --> 50:35.986
I'm not gonna miss
what's probably gonna be

50:36.086 --> 50:37.780
the social event of the season.

50:37.880 --> 50:39.949
- You hate people.
- But I love gatherings.

50:40.049 --> 50:42.326
- Isn't it ironic?
- Stop it. Stop being an asshole.

50:42.426 --> 50:44.787
- Someone's gotta watch the store.
- If you go, I go.

50:44.887 --> 50:46.163
She meant nothing to you.

50:46.263 --> 50:48.541
She meant nothing to you neither
until I told you she died.

50:48.641 --> 50:50.584
- I'm not taking you.
- I'm going with you.

50:50.684 --> 50:51.836
I can't close the store.

50:51.936 --> 50:54.137
You just closed the store
to play hockey on the roof.

50:54.305 --> 50:56.340
Exactly, which means
I can't close it for another hour

50:56.440 --> 50:58.267
so we can both go to a wake.

50:59.060 --> 51:00.511
You were saying?

51:00.611 --> 51:02.388
Thanks for putting me
in such a tough spot.

51:02.488 --> 51:04.314
You're a good friend.

51:05.942 --> 51:09.403
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Twenty-two, just like us.

51:09.737 --> 51:13.240
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.

51:13.366 --> 51:15.659
That's nothing compared
to how my cousin Walter died.

51:15.785 --> 51:18.529
- How did he die?
- He broke his neck.

51:18.629 --> 51:20.030
That's embarrassing?

51:20.130 --> 51:22.783
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

51:22.883 --> 51:25.035
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.

51:25.135 --> 51:27.037
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.

51:27.137 --> 51:28.539
Oh, my God.

51:28.639 --> 51:31.375
Come on, haven't you ever tried
to suck your own dick?

51:31.475 --> 51:33.002
- No.
- Yeah, right.

51:33.102 --> 51:34.378
You're so repressed.

51:34.478 --> 51:36.088
Because I never tried
to suck my own dick?

51:36.188 --> 51:37.548
No, because you won't admit to it.

51:37.648 --> 51:41.051
As if a guy's a fucking pervert because
he tries to get down on himself.

51:41.151 --> 51:44.054
You're as curious as the rest of us, pal.
You've tried it.

51:44.154 --> 51:45.514
Who found him?

51:45.614 --> 51:47.057
My cousin? My aunt found him.

51:47.157 --> 51:48.859
It was a mess. He was on his bed.

51:49.027 --> 51:52.237
His legs doubled over on himself.
Mom freaked out.

51:55.617 --> 51:58.410
- He made it, huh? A dick in his mouth.
- Yeah.

51:59.495 --> 52:01.538
Balls resting on his lips.

52:02.081 --> 52:05.208
- Wow, he really made it.
- Yeah, but at what a price.

52:08.504 --> 52:10.923
- I could never reach.
- Reach what?

52:11.507 --> 52:13.876
- You know.
- What, your dick?

52:13.976 --> 52:15.961
Yeah, like you said,
I guess everybody gets curious

52:16.061 --> 52:18.005
and tries it sometime.

52:18.105 --> 52:19.723
I never tried it.

52:22.185 --> 52:24.061
Fucking pervert.

52:43.289 --> 52:45.157
I knew this was a bad idea
to close the store.

52:45.257 --> 52:47.201
- Listen to you.
- I can't help it.

52:47.301 --> 52:50.412
At least when we were on the roof,
I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

52:50.512 --> 52:52.831
Nobody's there. It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

52:52.931 --> 52:55.342
How many people ever come
to the store at 4:00 on a Saturday?

52:56.844 --> 53:02.057
Let us in.

53:41.496 --> 53:44.490
- I can't fucking believe you.
- I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

53:44.590 --> 53:46.534
You knocked the casket over,
for Christ's sake.

53:46.634 --> 53:48.453
I was just leaning on it.
It was an accident.

53:48.553 --> 53:50.538
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose?

53:50.638 --> 53:52.457
So the casket fell over. Big deal.

53:52.557 --> 53:55.050
- Her fucking body fell out.
- So they'll put her back in it.

53:55.177 --> 53:57.336
It's not like it matters
if she breaks something.

53:57.436 --> 53:59.547
Just go. Just go open the video store.

53:59.647 --> 54:03.142
- Yeah, open the video store.
- Shut the fuck up, junkie.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.307
- Just go open the video store.
- Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

54:09.407 --> 54:12.518
And how many times have I told you
not to be dealing in front of the store?

54:12.618 --> 54:14.353
I'm not dealing, man.
What are you talking about?

54:14.453 --> 54:16.530
- You got anything, man?
- Yeah, man, what you want?

54:19.659 --> 54:22.445
- Hey, let me borrow your car.
- I don't wanna talk to you.

54:22.545 --> 54:24.113
Fine. Just let me borrow your car.

54:24.213 --> 54:27.450
- Why should I loan you my car?
- I wanna rent a movie.

54:27.550 --> 54:29.869
- You wanna rent a movie.
- I wanna rent a movie.

54:29.969 --> 54:32.413
- What's that for?
- You work in a video store.

54:32.513 --> 54:34.415
I work in a shitty video store.

54:34.515 --> 54:38.219
I wanna go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

54:40.055 --> 54:42.215
And a pack of cigarettes.

54:42.315 --> 54:43.883
Cute cat. What is its name?

54:43.983 --> 54:46.852
- Annoying Customer.
- Fucking dickhead.

54:49.940 --> 54:52.642
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers sometimes?

54:52.742 --> 54:53.851
Let me borrow your car.

54:53.951 --> 54:55.895
- May I be blunt with you?
- If you must.

54:55.995 --> 54:58.113
We are employees
of the Quick Stop Convenience

54:58.240 --> 54:59.815
and RST Video, respectively.

54:59.915 --> 55:01.984
As such, we have certain obligations.

55:02.084 --> 55:03.694
Though they may seem
cruel and unusual,

55:03.794 --> 55:05.613
does mean manning the store
until closing.

55:05.713 --> 55:07.823
I see, so playing hockey
and attending wakes,

55:07.923 --> 55:09.951
these practices
are standard operating procedure?

55:10.051 --> 55:11.827
There's a difference.
Those were obligations.

55:11.927 --> 55:14.372
Obligations that couldn't have been met
at any other date.

55:14.472 --> 55:15.915
Now, renting videos,
that's just gratuitous,

55:16.015 --> 55:19.210
not to mention illogical,
being that you work at a video store.

55:19.310 --> 55:21.045
- Are you open?
- Yes.

55:21.145 --> 55:23.297
Know what?
I don't think I care for your rationale.

55:23.397 --> 55:26.008
Well, it's gonna have to do,
being that it's my car up for request.

55:26.108 --> 55:28.427
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.

55:28.527 --> 55:29.720
So, what's your point?

55:29.820 --> 55:32.348
My point is you're a clerk,
paid to do a job.

55:32.448 --> 55:35.393
You can't just do anything you want
while you're working.

55:35.493 --> 55:40.189
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time Warner.

55:40.289 --> 55:42.283
"Reports stock increase."

55:43.451 --> 55:45.778
They print any kind of shit
in these papers.

55:45.878 --> 55:47.363
They certainly do, $3.

55:47.463 --> 55:49.782
So your argument is
that title dictates behaviour?

55:49.882 --> 55:51.659
- What?
- You won't let me use your car

55:51.759 --> 55:53.744
because I have a title
and a job description.

55:53.844 --> 55:56.539
- I'm supposed to follow it, right?
- Exactly.

55:56.639 --> 56:02.128
I saw one, one time that said
the next week the world is ending.

56:02.228 --> 56:04.255
And then in the next week's paper,
they said,

56:04.355 --> 56:07.508
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

56:07.608 --> 56:12.555
"by a koala-fish mutant bird."
Crazy shit.

56:12.655 --> 56:15.357
So I'm no more responsible
for my decisions here than, say,

56:15.483 --> 56:17.184
a death-squad soldier in Bosnia?

56:17.284 --> 56:20.229
Now that's stretching it.
You're not being asked to slay children.

56:20.329 --> 56:21.731
Yeah, not yet.

56:21.831 --> 56:23.783
And I remember one time...

56:25.327 --> 56:27.987
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk-off.

56:28.087 --> 56:29.405
I'm sorry, he meant to hit me.

56:29.505 --> 56:30.740
- Well, he missed.
- Yeah, I know.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.576
Let me refund your money
and we'll call it even, all right?

56:33.676 --> 56:35.453
Yeah, I'll never come in here again.

56:35.553 --> 56:39.506
And if I see you again, I'm gonna
break your fucking head open.

56:43.637 --> 56:45.880
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Two reasons,

56:45.980 --> 56:47.715
one, I hate it
when the people can't shut up

56:47.815 --> 56:49.592
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

56:49.692 --> 56:51.636
- Oh, Jesus.
- And two, to prove a point.

56:51.736 --> 56:53.971
- Title does not dictate behaviour.
- What?

56:54.071 --> 56:56.891
If title dictated my behaviour,
as a clerk serving the public,

56:56.991 --> 56:59.018
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy.

56:59.118 --> 57:02.563
But I did, so my point is
that people dictate their own behaviour.

57:02.663 --> 57:04.065
Even though I work in a video store,

57:04.165 --> 57:06.108
I choose to go rent movies
at Big Choice.

57:06.208 --> 57:07.610
Agreed?

57:07.710 --> 57:09.745
You're a danger
to both the dead and the living.

57:09.871 --> 57:11.947
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

57:12.047 --> 57:15.334
- Please, get the hell out of here.
- I know I'm your hero.

57:21.383 --> 57:23.542
Sounds to me like
somebody needs to hit the gym.

57:23.642 --> 57:24.669
Excuse me?

57:24.769 --> 57:27.963
I heard you strain when you picked up
that milk. Could only weigh 7 pounds.

57:28.063 --> 57:29.465
I didn't strain, I sighed.

57:29.565 --> 57:31.801
I don't think so. That was a grunt.

57:31.901 --> 57:35.638
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

57:35.738 --> 57:37.056
I'm a trainer.

57:37.156 --> 57:39.600
I know what that sound signifies.
You're out of shape.

57:39.700 --> 57:42.019
What are you talking about?
There's no fat on my body.

57:42.119 --> 57:45.314
No fat. No tone, either.
You don't get enough exercise.

57:45.414 --> 57:46.907
- You open?
- Yes.

57:48.201 --> 57:50.319
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

57:50.419 --> 57:54.073
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Do you think this guy's out of shape?

57:54.173 --> 57:56.367
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

57:56.467 --> 57:58.502
- He is.
- I am not.

57:59.295 --> 58:01.455
- How much can you bench?
- I don't know.

58:01.555 --> 58:06.085
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.
- Oh, I know I can bench more than that.

58:06.185 --> 58:09.046
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way.

58:09.146 --> 58:10.472
Feel that.

58:11.266 --> 58:14.176
Hey, that's tight. Solid.

58:14.276 --> 58:15.845
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

58:15.945 --> 58:17.596
Oh, for God's sakes.

58:17.696 --> 58:18.848
See? You're ashamed.

58:18.948 --> 58:22.276
You know you're out of shape.
Here, take my card.

58:22.444 --> 58:25.020
I can get you on
an aerobics free-weights programme.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.689
- Are you open?
- Yes.

58:26.789 --> 58:28.190
I'm not out of shape.

58:28.290 --> 58:29.859
Excuse me,
have you been here all day?

58:29.959 --> 58:32.903
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

58:33.003 --> 58:34.697
I don't have love handles.

58:34.797 --> 58:37.408
- Were you working here about 4:00?
- Yes.

58:37.508 --> 58:39.326
It's probably
from being around all this food.

58:39.426 --> 58:40.418
Oh, I know.

58:40.518 --> 58:44.039
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

58:44.139 --> 58:45.916
I'm not out of shape.

58:46.016 --> 58:47.877
- Can I have your name please?
- Dante Hicks.

58:47.977 --> 58:49.378
Why? What is this all about?

58:49.478 --> 58:51.046
You're Dante Hicks?

58:51.146 --> 58:53.466
Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognise you.

58:53.566 --> 58:56.010
- Because he's out of shape.
- Do I know you?

58:56.110 --> 58:58.763
Yeah, do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out with...

58:58.863 --> 59:00.639
- Caitlin Bree.
- I'm her sister.

59:00.739 --> 59:02.683
- You're Alyssa's sister, Heather?
- Yes.

59:02.783 --> 59:05.319
- Did you say Caitlin Bree?
- Yeah.

59:06.154 --> 59:08.272
Pretty girl, little taller than her.

59:08.372 --> 59:10.065
- Gorgeous body?
- Yeah.

59:10.165 --> 59:11.400
And you're Dante Hicks?

59:11.500 --> 59:13.652
You went to the same school.
You played hockey.

59:13.752 --> 59:16.113
- Yeah, how did you know that?
- You still going out with her?

59:16.213 --> 59:17.573
No, she's getting married.

59:17.673 --> 59:20.409
- To you?
- No, to an Asian design major.

59:20.509 --> 59:21.835
Oh, shit.

59:22.712 --> 59:26.040
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I used to fuck her.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.417
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

59:28.517 --> 59:31.253
While you two were dating,
I drove a black Trans Am.

59:31.353 --> 59:33.464
- You're Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

59:33.564 --> 59:35.466
- You know him?
- Yeah.

59:35.566 --> 59:38.344
- Caitlin talked about him all the time.
- Really?

59:38.444 --> 59:42.139
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

59:42.239 --> 59:44.892
Man, don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

59:44.992 --> 59:47.269
I'm surprised
you didn't know about it, Dante.

59:47.369 --> 59:50.105
Everybody in school knew about it,
even in my class.

59:50.205 --> 59:52.942
Jesus Christ, what next?

59:53.042 --> 59:54.276
- Here you go.
- What's this?

59:54.376 --> 59:56.111
- It's a fine for $500.
- What?

59:56.211 --> 59:57.696
Five hundred bucks? For what?

59:57.796 --> 01:00:02.785
For violation of New Jersey Statute
Section 2A, number 1 70/51.

01:00:02.885 --> 01:00:05.913
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco

01:00:06.013 --> 01:00:09.083
or tobacco-related products
to persons under the age of 18

01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:10.459
is regarded as disorderly.

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:12.169
What are you talking about?

01:00:12.269 --> 01:00:14.839
An angry mother called
the state division of taxation

01:00:14.939 --> 01:00:16.882
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

01:00:16.982 --> 01:00:20.060
sold her 4-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes at 4:00 today.

01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:22.721
The New Jersey division of taxation
called the Board of Health

01:00:22.821 --> 01:00:24.974
and sent me down to issue a fine.

01:00:25.074 --> 01:00:26.851
You claimed
you were working here all day,

01:00:26.951 --> 01:00:28.561
hence the fine is yours.

01:00:28.661 --> 01:00:31.397
The fine is doubled due
to the incredibly young age of the child.

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.566
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids.

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:36.694
You sold cigarettes to a 4-year-old?
What a scumbag.

01:00:36.794 --> 01:00:38.195
That's sick, Dante.

01:00:38.295 --> 01:00:41.115
I didn't sell any cigarettes to any kids.
I swear.

01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:42.624
The due date is on the bottom.

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:45.661
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

01:00:45.761 --> 01:00:47.872
Failure to remit before the due date

01:00:47.972 --> 01:00:49.832
will result in a charge
of criminal negligence

01:00:49.932 --> 01:00:51.750
and a warrant will be issued
for your arrest.

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.135
Have a nice day.

01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:56.847
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids. Hey, wait a minute.

01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:59.433
Forget it.

01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:02.761
I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to 4-year-olds.

01:01:02.861 --> 01:01:06.356
- Can I give you a lift somewhere?
- Sure.

01:01:06.816 --> 01:01:09.526
- How about the beach?
- I like the way you think.

01:01:14.866 --> 01:01:16.658
Jesus, what next?

01:01:16.826 --> 01:01:18.869
- Dante?
- What?

01:01:19.037 --> 01:01:20.245
Caitlin?

01:01:42.894 --> 01:01:44.970
- When did you get home?
- Just now.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.022
I can't believe it. I haven't seen you...

01:01:50.318 --> 01:01:52.152
Dante, you have a customer.

01:01:55.615 --> 01:01:57.858
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.778
- She was with Rick Derris.
- Let's not talk about that.

01:02:00.878 --> 01:02:04.114
- How did you get home?
- Train, it took eight hours.

01:02:04.214 --> 01:02:05.282
I can't believe you're here.

01:02:05.382 --> 01:02:07.326
- Excuse me...
- Yeah, back behind the oil.

01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:09.169
- How long are you staying?
- Until Monday.

01:02:09.337 --> 01:02:11.338
Then I have to take the train back.

01:02:11.506 --> 01:02:12.502
Pack of cigarettes.

01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:13.666
Hey, congratulations.

01:02:13.766 --> 01:02:15.459
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:18.345
- She's marrying an Asian design major.
- So I'm told.

01:02:49.168 --> 01:02:50.711
You're just gonna close the store?

01:02:50.837 --> 01:02:53.038
I wanna talk to you
and I don't wanna be disturbed.

01:02:53.138 --> 01:02:55.457
There's something
I read in the tabloids.

01:02:55.557 --> 01:02:57.793
- You saw it?
- Very dramatic, I thought.

01:02:57.893 --> 01:02:59.795
- It's not what you think.
- It's not what I think.

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:02.506
It's worse? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child?

01:03:02.606 --> 01:03:04.800
- What's going on here?
- I am not pregnant.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.011
Were you gonna tell me
or just send me an invitation?

01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:08.137
I was gonna tell you,

01:03:08.237 --> 01:03:10.472
but we were getting along,
I didn't want to mess it up.

01:03:10.572 --> 01:03:13.600
You could've broken it to me gently
by telling me you had a boyfriend.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.645
- I mean I told you I have a girlfriend.
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:03:16.745 --> 01:03:19.606
But when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

01:03:19.706 --> 01:03:21.191
And he proposed last month.

01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:23.902
- And you said yes?
- Well, kind of, sort of.

01:03:24.002 --> 01:03:26.822
Is that what they teach in that
school of yours? Kind of, sort of?

01:03:26.922 --> 01:03:29.700
Everyone knows about this except me.
Do you know how humiliating that is?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.745
I would've told you, and
you would have stopped calling me.

01:03:32.845 --> 01:03:34.830
- How do you know that?
- Because I know you.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:38.000
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.377
- So you're really getting married?
- No.

01:03:40.477 --> 01:03:42.504
You're not really getting married?

01:03:42.604 --> 01:03:44.089
The story goes like this,

01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:46.967
he proposed to me,
I told him I had to think about it,

01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:48.935
and he insisted I wear the ring anyway.

01:03:49.103 --> 01:03:51.346
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

01:03:51.446 --> 01:03:52.765
How like her.

01:03:52.865 --> 01:03:54.058
Then my mother called me this morning

01:03:54.158 --> 01:03:56.393
to let me know that
the announcement was in the paper.

01:03:56.493 --> 01:03:58.278
That's when I hopped the train
to come back.

01:03:58.404 --> 01:03:59.688
I knew you'd be a wreck.

01:03:59.788 --> 01:04:02.649
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?

01:04:02.749 --> 01:04:04.526
Wreck is a harsh term.

01:04:04.626 --> 01:04:06.945
Disturbed is more like it.
Mildly disturbed, even.

01:04:07.045 --> 01:04:10.532
I love a macho faÃ§ade.
It is such a turn-on.

01:04:10.632 --> 01:04:11.700
What smells like shoe polish?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.244
So you came here to what,
to comfort me?

01:04:14.344 --> 01:04:17.206
The last thing I needed was for you
to think I was hiding something.

01:04:17.306 --> 01:04:18.999
- But you were.
- No, I wasn't.

01:04:19.099 --> 01:04:21.460
Not really.
I told you I'd been seeing other people.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.636
Yeah, but not seriously.

01:04:22.762 --> 01:04:24.338
Christ, you're ready
to walk down the aisle.

01:04:24.438 --> 01:04:26.715
That constitutes something more
than just seeing somebody.

01:04:26.815 --> 01:04:30.135
- I mean, what's going on?
- I'm giving him his ring back.

01:04:30.235 --> 01:04:31.470
What?

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:34.306
I don't wanna marry him.
I don't wanna get married now.

01:04:34.406 --> 01:04:37.059
I'm on the verge of graduation.
I want to go to grad school after this.

01:04:37.159 --> 01:04:39.061
And then I wanna start a career.

01:04:39.161 --> 01:04:40.229
I don't wanna be a wife first,

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:43.190
and then worry about when I'm gonna
fit in all of the other stuff.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.567
I've come way too far
and studied too damn hard

01:04:45.667 --> 01:04:48.703
to let my education go to waste
as a housewife.

01:04:49.455 --> 01:04:51.031
And I know that's what I'd become.

01:04:51.131 --> 01:04:52.491
Sang's just signed with a major firm,

01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:54.910
and he's gonna be pulling in
a huge salary,

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:58.330
which would give me
no reason to work. He's very traditional.

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.083
Wait a minute, his name is Sang?
Past tense?

01:05:01.183 --> 01:05:02.751
Stop it. He's a nice guy.

01:05:02.851 --> 01:05:05.379
Well, if he's so nice,
why aren't you marrying him?

01:05:05.479 --> 01:05:07.005
I just told you.

01:05:07.105 --> 01:05:09.349
There's more to this, isn't there?

01:05:09.475 --> 01:05:11.927
Why, Mr Hicks,
whatever do you mean?

01:05:12.027 --> 01:05:13.387
I don't have something to do with it?

01:05:13.487 --> 01:05:15.389
- You have nothing to do with it.
- Oh, you lie.

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:16.890
Look how full of yourself you are.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.725
I believe in giving credit
where credit's due.

01:05:18.825 --> 01:05:21.395
And I believe I'm the impetus
behind your refusal to wed.

01:05:21.495 --> 01:05:23.063
If I'm so nuts about you,

01:05:23.163 --> 01:05:25.941
then why am I having sex
with an Asian design major?

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:27.909
Jesus, you're so caustic.

01:05:28.035 --> 01:05:30.612
I had to knock you down
from that cloud you were floating on.

01:05:30.712 --> 01:05:32.781
When I say I don't wanna get married,
I mean just that.

01:05:32.881 --> 01:05:36.084
I don't want to marry anybody.
Not for years.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:38.370
Who's asking?
I don't wanna marry you.

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:41.039
Good. Keep in that frame of mind.

01:05:41.139 --> 01:05:42.291
Well, let's date.

01:05:42.391 --> 01:05:46.086
Oh, I think Sang and Veronica,
they'd love that.

01:05:46.186 --> 01:05:48.547
We can introduce the two of them.
They may hit it off.

01:05:48.647 --> 01:05:50.799
You're serious. You wanna date again.

01:05:50.899 --> 01:05:52.634
I wanna be your boyfriend, yes.

01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:55.053
It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years.

01:05:55.153 --> 01:05:58.098
- Believe me, you'll get over it.
- Give me a bit more credit.

01:05:58.198 --> 01:05:59.975
I think it's time we got back together.

01:06:00.075 --> 01:06:02.311
I mean, I'm more mature,
you're more mature,

01:06:02.411 --> 01:06:04.521
you're finishing college,
I'm already in the job market.

01:06:04.621 --> 01:06:06.607
- You work in a market, all right.
- Cute.

01:06:06.707 --> 01:06:09.818
Tell me you wouldn't wanna go out
after the talking we've been doing.

01:06:09.918 --> 01:06:11.820
The key word here is talk, Dante.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.406
I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating

01:06:14.506 --> 01:06:17.576
is a lot more idyllic than what
actually happens when we date.

01:06:17.676 --> 01:06:20.787
So, what, are we supposed to
pretend over the phone we're dating?

01:06:20.887 --> 01:06:23.165
I don't know, maybe we should just see
what happens.

01:06:23.265 --> 01:06:25.584
- Let me take you out tonight.
- On a date?

01:06:25.684 --> 01:06:28.345
Yeah, a real date. Dinner and a movie.

01:06:28.763 --> 01:06:30.505
The Dante Hicks
dinner-and-movie date.

01:06:30.605 --> 01:06:34.851
- I think I've been on that one before.
- You have a better suggestion?

01:06:35.394 --> 01:06:38.096
How about
the Caitlin Bree walk-on-the-boardwalk

01:06:38.196 --> 01:06:40.815
then-get-naked-somewhere
kind-of-private date?

01:06:40.942 --> 01:06:43.352
- I hear that's kind of a popular date.
- Jerk.

01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:46.855
God, here I am, throwing myself at you,
succumbing to your wily charms,

01:06:46.955 --> 01:06:49.316
and you're calling me a slut,
in so many words.

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:50.817
- What about Sing?
- Sang.

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:53.028
- Sang.
- He's not invited.

01:06:53.128 --> 01:06:54.446
He's your fiancÃ©.

01:06:54.546 --> 01:06:57.491
I'm offering you my body
and you're offering me semantics.

01:06:57.591 --> 01:06:59.660
He's just a boyfriend, Dante.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.078
And in case you haven't gotten the drift

01:07:01.178 --> 01:07:04.456
of why I came
all the way here from Ohio,

01:07:04.556 --> 01:07:07.000
I'm about to become single again.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.878
And yes, allow me to placate your ego,

01:07:09.978 --> 01:07:12.965
you are the inspiration for this bold
and momentous decision

01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:16.134
that will probably get me ostracised
from both school and home.

01:07:16.234 --> 01:07:19.813
You ask me who I choose,
I choose you.

01:07:21.232 --> 01:07:23.809
- So, what are you saying?
- You're such an asshole.

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.060
Just kidding.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.396
I can already see
this is not gonna work out.

01:07:27.496 --> 01:07:29.690
I'll ask Randal to close up
when he gets back.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.941
Where is he anyway?

01:07:31.041 --> 01:07:32.901
I thought he'd be at your side,
like a lapdog.

01:07:33.001 --> 01:07:35.028
He went to go rent a movie,
he isn't back yet.

01:07:35.128 --> 01:07:36.905
Screw it,
I'll close up and leave him a note.

01:07:37.005 --> 01:07:38.740
You're too responsible.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.076
But no. I have to go home first.

01:07:41.176 --> 01:07:43.245
They don't even know
I've left school yet.

01:07:43.345 --> 01:07:45.414
And I should break
the disengagement news to my mother,

01:07:45.514 --> 01:07:49.001
which is gonna cause quite a row,
considering she loves Sang.

01:07:49.101 --> 01:07:50.510
Who doesn't?

01:07:50.845 --> 01:07:52.512
Well, me, I guess.

01:07:53.931 --> 01:07:57.134
So I shall take my leave of you,
but I will return in a little while,

01:07:57.234 --> 01:08:00.721
at which time, yes, I would love to go
for dinner and a movie with you.

01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:03.181
Hey, what happened to the walk
and the nakedness?

01:08:03.281 --> 01:08:06.860
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.
See you later, handsome.

01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:14.367
Yes.

01:08:32.678 --> 01:08:35.263
- Get to work.
- Hey, what did you rent?

01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:39.301
- "Best of Both Worlds"?
- Hermaphroditic porn.

01:08:39.401 --> 01:08:41.761
Starlets with both organs.
You should see the box.

01:08:41.862 --> 01:08:43.971
Beautiful chicks with dicks
that put mine to shame.

01:08:44.072 --> 01:08:46.475
- And you rented this?
- Hey, I like to expand my horizons.

01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:48.393
I got fined
for selling cigarettes to a minor.

01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:50.395
- No way.
- Five hundred dollars.

01:08:50.495 --> 01:08:52.906
- You're bullshitting.
- No, I'm not.

01:08:55.743 --> 01:08:57.861
Holy shit,
I didn't even think they enforced this.

01:08:57.961 --> 01:08:59.071
Living proof.

01:08:59.171 --> 01:09:00.572
You never sold cigarettes to kids.

01:09:00.671 --> 01:09:02.783
- I didn't, you did.
- Really?

01:09:02.883 --> 01:09:05.035
Yep. Little girl, maybe 4 years old?

01:09:05.135 --> 01:09:06.620
Holy shit, that girl?

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.497
As opposed
to the hundreds of other children

01:09:08.596 --> 01:09:10.082
you've sold cigarettes
while working here.

01:09:10.182 --> 01:09:12.417
- Then how come you got the fine?
- Because I'm here.

01:09:12.517 --> 01:09:14.294
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

01:09:14.394 --> 01:09:15.837
Then why aren't you screaming at me?

01:09:15.937 --> 01:09:17.381
- Because I'm happy.
- You're happy?

01:09:17.481 --> 01:09:18.965
- I'm happy.
- You're happy to get a fine?

01:09:19.064 --> 01:09:22.010
- I'm happy because Caitlin came.
- I know you're lying.

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:24.095
- I'm not, she just left.
- What did she say?

01:09:24.196 --> 01:09:26.598
She said she's not marrying that guy.
She went home to tell her mom.

01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:28.683
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.

01:09:28.783 --> 01:09:30.977
Wow, you've had quite an evening.

01:09:31.077 --> 01:09:33.438
She went home and
she's getting ready. We're going out.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:35.941
I feel so ineffectual.
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:37.692
Watch the store while I go and change.

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:39.277
What happened
to title dictates behaviour?

01:09:39.377 --> 01:09:42.488
Well, this is my way
of spitting water at life.

01:09:42.589 --> 01:09:45.158
All right, you want me to bring
the VCR over so we can watch this?

01:09:45.258 --> 01:09:47.493
No, I might be leaving early.

01:09:47.594 --> 01:09:49.121
You're gonna have to lock up
the store tonight.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.881
All right, but you're missing out.
Chicks with dicks.

01:10:21.412 --> 01:10:23.079
No.

01:10:24.331 --> 01:10:28.452
Well, Randal Graves,
scourge of the video renter.

01:10:28.552 --> 01:10:29.911
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:32.914
Ms Asian Design Major herself,
Caitlin Bree.

01:10:33.014 --> 01:10:35.417
You saw that article?
God, isn't it awful?

01:10:35.517 --> 01:10:38.086
- My mother sent that in.
- I take it she likes the guy.

01:10:38.186 --> 01:10:40.589
You'd think she's marrying him.

01:10:40.689 --> 01:10:43.425
- What are you watching?
- Children's programming.

01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:46.094
What did your mom say when
you told her you weren't engaged?

01:10:46.194 --> 01:10:48.930
She said not to come home
until after graduation.

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:51.099
Wow, you got thrown out for Dante?

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:53.768
What can I say?
He does weird things to me.

01:10:53.868 --> 01:10:55.937
- Can I watch?
- You can hold me down.

01:10:56.037 --> 01:10:57.564
Can I join in?

01:10:57.664 --> 01:10:59.900
You might be let down.
I'm not a hermaphrodite.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.276
Hey, few are.

01:11:01.376 --> 01:11:03.445
So, what makes you think you can
maintain a relationship with him

01:11:03.545 --> 01:11:05.280
this time around?

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.865
A woman's intuition.

01:11:06.965 --> 01:11:11.211
Something inside me says it's time
to give the old boy a serious try.

01:11:11.462 --> 01:11:13.914
Hey, you know, you and I
have something in common.

01:11:14.014 --> 01:11:15.582
We both eat Chinese.

01:11:15.682 --> 01:11:17.375
- Dick.
- Exactly.

01:11:17.475 --> 01:11:18.627
So where is he?

01:11:18.727 --> 01:11:20.629
He went home
to change for the big date.

01:11:20.729 --> 01:11:24.390
- God, isn't he great?
- No, this is great.

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:26.635
Oh, Lord. Can I use your bathroom?

01:11:26.735 --> 01:11:29.137
- There's no light back there.
- Why aren't there any lights?

01:11:29.237 --> 01:11:32.599
Well, there are, but for some reason,
they stop working at 5:14 every night.

01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:34.684
- You're kidding.
- Nobody can figure it out.

01:11:34.784 --> 01:11:36.811
The boss doesn't wanna pay
the electrician to fix it,

01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:39.314
because the electrician owes money
to the video store.

01:11:39.414 --> 01:11:41.316
Such a sordid state of affairs.

01:11:41.416 --> 01:11:44.486
And I'm caught in the middle,
torn between my loyalty for the boss

01:11:44.586 --> 01:11:47.322
and my desire to piss with the lights on.

01:11:47.422 --> 01:11:49.157
I'll try to manage.

01:11:49.257 --> 01:11:50.617
Oh, hey, Caitlin.

01:11:50.717 --> 01:11:53.078
Break his heart again this time,
and I'll kill you.

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.871
Nothing personal.

01:11:54.971 --> 01:11:58.083
You are very protective of him, Randal.
You always have been.

01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:00.802
Territoriality, he was mine first.

01:12:00.928 --> 01:12:03.054
Oh, that was so cute.

01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:19.445
- Who eats cock?
- A bunch of savages in this town.

01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:20.647
Hey, Caitlin's in the back.

01:12:20.747 --> 01:12:22.732
Check on her,
she's been back there a long time.

01:12:22.832 --> 01:12:25.110
- There are no lights back there.
- I told her that.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.537
She said she didn't need any.

01:12:27.746 --> 01:12:30.365
Why don't you go join her?
Make a little bathroom bam-bam.

01:12:30.465 --> 01:12:32.659
I love your sexy talk.
It's so kindergarten.

01:12:32.759 --> 01:12:34.919
- Poo-poo, wee-wee.
- Fuck you.

01:12:48.934 --> 01:12:52.478
- How did you get here so fast?
- I left like an hour ago.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.850
Do you always talk this weird
after you violate a woman?

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:59.185
Maybe the Asian design major
slipped her some opium.

01:12:59.285 --> 01:13:00.653
Could be.

01:13:00.821 --> 01:13:04.407
- It has never been like that before.
- Like what?

01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:09.162
When you just lay perfectly still
and let me do everything.

01:13:09.496 --> 01:13:11.998
- Am I missing something here?
- Okay.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:15.201
I went back there,
and Dante was already waiting for me.

01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:16.794
He was?

01:13:17.004 --> 01:13:19.756
It was so cool. He didn't say a word.

01:13:19.923 --> 01:13:21.633
He didn't have to.

01:13:22.509 --> 01:13:25.045
He was just ready, you know?

01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:27.631
And, like, we didn't kiss
or talk or anything.

01:13:27.731 --> 01:13:29.716
He just sat there
and let me do all the work.

01:13:29.816 --> 01:13:32.344
You dog.
I didn't even see you go back there.

01:13:32.444 --> 01:13:35.938
And the fact that there weren't
any lights on made it so...

01:13:36.106 --> 01:13:38.024
God, that was so great.

01:13:38.525 --> 01:13:40.526
My legs are still shaking.

01:13:41.987 --> 01:13:43.488
It wasn't me.

01:13:44.448 --> 01:13:46.941
Yeah, right. Who was it then, Randal?

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:48.943
- Was it you?
- No, I was up here the whole time.

01:13:49.043 --> 01:13:51.913
- You two better quit it.
- I'm serious.

01:13:52.498 --> 01:13:54.866
Oh, so we didn't just have sex
in the bathroom?

01:13:54.966 --> 01:13:56.042
No.

01:14:00.047 --> 01:14:01.998
Stop it, this isn't funny.

01:14:02.098 --> 01:14:04.959
I'm not fooling around.
I just came in from outside.

01:14:05.059 --> 01:14:07.504
- This isn't fucking funny, Dante.
- I'm not kidding.

01:14:07.604 --> 01:14:09.631
- Who went back there?
- Nobody, I swear.

01:14:09.731 --> 01:14:10.799
I feel nauseous.

01:14:10.899 --> 01:14:12.175
Are you sure
there was someone there?

01:14:12.275 --> 01:14:14.844
Well, I didn't just fuck myself.
Jesus Christ.

01:14:14.944 --> 01:14:16.054
God, I'm gonna be sick.

01:14:16.154 --> 01:14:18.940
- You just fucked a total stranger?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:14:19.316 --> 01:14:20.642
- Call the police.
- No, don't.

01:14:20.742 --> 01:14:22.977
There's a stranger in our bathroom
and he just raped Caitlin.

01:14:23.077 --> 01:14:25.772
- She said she did all the work.
- Would you shut the fuck up?

01:14:25.872 --> 01:14:28.199
Who the fuck is in our bathroom?

01:14:30.077 --> 01:14:32.153
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

01:14:32.253 --> 01:14:34.656
He just came in
and asked to use the bathroom.

01:14:34.756 --> 01:14:36.449
- What time was this?
- I don't know.

01:14:36.549 --> 01:14:40.412
- What time did hockey end?
- Like 3:00, 3:30.

01:14:40.512 --> 01:14:42.330
And what time did we get back
from the funeral?

01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:44.708
- 4:00, I think.
- Wait, who was working here?

01:14:44.808 --> 01:14:46.042
Just me.

01:14:46.142 --> 01:14:48.670
I thought you said you went
to play hockey and went to a funeral.

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:49.838
Yeah, we did.

01:14:49.938 --> 01:14:51.472
Well, then
who was operating the store?

01:14:51.598 --> 01:14:54.634
- Nobody, it was closed.
- With this guy locked in here?

01:14:54.734 --> 01:14:57.971
Well, everything happened so quickly,
I guess I forgot he was back there.

01:14:58.071 --> 01:15:00.273
- Can we take it now?
- Go ahead.

01:15:06.363 --> 01:15:08.690
Was he alive when Caitlin...

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:11.067
No, I place the time of death
at about 3:20.

01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:13.703
Then how could she, you know?

01:15:14.037 --> 01:15:16.114
The body can maintain an erection
after expiration.

01:15:16.214 --> 01:15:17.574
Sometimes for hours.

01:15:17.674 --> 01:15:19.409
Did he have the magazine
when he came in?

01:15:19.509 --> 01:15:21.377
No, I gave it to him.

01:15:22.254 --> 01:15:24.005
He asked me for it.

01:15:24.506 --> 01:15:26.416
I can't say
until we get him back to the lab,

01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:29.544
but my guess is he was masturbating,
his heart seized and he died.

01:15:29.644 --> 01:15:31.963
That's when the girl found him.

01:15:32.063 --> 01:15:33.548
Something smells like shoe polish.

01:15:33.648 --> 01:15:36.384
This has gotta be the weirdest thing
you've ever been called in on.

01:15:36.484 --> 01:15:38.762
Actually, I once had to tag a kid
that broke his neck

01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:41.481
trying to put his mouth on his penis.

01:15:42.024 --> 01:15:43.558
What about Caitlin?

01:15:43.658 --> 01:15:46.519
Shock trauma, she's gonna need
years of therapy after this.

01:15:46.619 --> 01:15:50.356
My question is, how did she come
to have sex with the dead man?

01:15:50.456 --> 01:15:52.325
She thought it was me.

01:15:52.868 --> 01:15:55.953
What kind of convenience store
do you run here?

01:16:23.357 --> 01:16:24.641
Salsa shark.

01:16:24.741 --> 01:16:27.026
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

01:16:28.862 --> 01:16:32.106
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa,

01:16:32.206 --> 01:16:34.617
shark's in the salsa, our shark.

01:16:35.953 --> 01:16:37.612
Oh, what? What's with you, man?

01:16:37.712 --> 01:16:39.447
You haven't said anything
for like 20 minutes.

01:16:39.547 --> 01:16:41.282
What the hell's your problem?

01:16:41.382 --> 01:16:43.243
- This life.
- This life?

01:16:43.343 --> 01:16:45.411
Why do I have this life?

01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:47.372
Have some chips, you'll feel better.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:51.209
I'm stuck in this pit,
working for less than slave wages,

01:16:51.309 --> 01:16:55.221
working on my day off,
the goddamn steel shutters are closed,

01:16:55.556 --> 01:16:59.968
I deal with every backward-ass fuck
on the planet, I smell like shoe polish,

01:17:00.068 --> 01:17:03.388
my ex-girlfriend is catatonic
after fucking a dead guy,

01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:06.399
and my present girlfriend
has sucked 36 dicks.

01:17:06.525 --> 01:17:07.684
Thirty-seven.

01:17:07.784 --> 01:17:09.811
My life is in the shitter right now
and if you don't mind,

01:17:09.911 --> 01:17:11.271
I'd like to stew a bit.

01:17:11.371 --> 01:17:12.989
- You open?
- Yeah.

01:17:15.659 --> 01:17:16.943
That's all bullshit, man.

01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:18.528
You know what
the real problem here is?

01:17:18.628 --> 01:17:19.863
I was born.

01:17:19.963 --> 01:17:22.907
- You should shit or get off the pot.
- I should shit or get off the pot.

01:17:23.007 --> 01:17:25.743
- You should shit or get off the pot.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:17:25.843 --> 01:17:29.205
I'm talking about this inability
to improve your station in life.

01:17:29.305 --> 01:17:30.665
- Fuck you.
- It's true, man.

01:17:30.765 --> 01:17:33.334
You sit there and blame life
for dealing you a cruddy hand,

01:17:33.434 --> 01:17:36.671
never once accepting the responsibility
for the way your situation is.

01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:38.006
What responsibility?

01:17:38.106 --> 01:17:40.174
All right,
if you hate this job and the people,

01:17:40.274 --> 01:17:43.011
and the fact that you have to come in
on your day off, why don't you quit?

01:17:43.111 --> 01:17:46.014
- Well, like it's that easy.
- It is, you just up and quit.

01:17:46.114 --> 01:17:48.433
There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

01:17:48.533 --> 01:17:50.810
You're bound to be qualified
for at least one of them.

01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:52.770
- So, what's stopping you?
- Leave me alone.

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.188
Oh, you're comfortable, right?

01:17:54.288 --> 01:17:56.691
This is a life of convenience for you.
Any attempt to change it

01:17:56.791 --> 01:18:00.194
would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

01:18:00.294 --> 01:18:01.738
Like your life's any better?

01:18:01.838 --> 01:18:03.865
Hey, I'm satisfied
with my situation for now.

01:18:03.965 --> 01:18:05.199
You don't hear me complaining.

01:18:05.299 --> 01:18:07.452
You, on the other hand,
have been bitching all day.

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:09.370
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.623
- It's the same with Veronica.
- Leave her out of this.

01:18:11.723 --> 01:18:13.541
You date Veronica
because it's convenient,

01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:14.918
and she's low maintenance.

01:18:15.018 --> 01:18:17.378
But meanwhile, all you ever do
is talk about Caitlin.

01:18:17.478 --> 01:18:19.714
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

01:18:19.814 --> 01:18:22.008
In high school, for God's sake.
You're 22.

01:18:22.108 --> 01:18:23.134
Leave me alone.

01:18:23.234 --> 01:18:26.479
If you want Caitlin, then talk to Veronica
and be with Caitlin.

01:18:26.605 --> 01:18:28.556
If you want Veronica,
then be with Veronica.

01:18:28.656 --> 01:18:30.892
But don't pine for one
and fuck the other.

01:18:30.992 --> 01:18:34.312
- If you weren't such a fucking coward...
- If I wasn't such a fucking coward.

01:18:34.412 --> 01:18:37.941
It must be so great to have this ability
to simplify things the way you do.

01:18:38.041 --> 01:18:40.068
- Am I right or what?
- You're wrong.

01:18:40.168 --> 01:18:41.694
Things happened today, all right?

01:18:41.794 --> 01:18:43.738
Things that probably
ruined my chances with Caitlin.

01:18:43.838 --> 01:18:45.239
Oh, what? The dead guy?

01:18:45.339 --> 01:18:47.116
She'll get over fucking a dead guy.

01:18:47.216 --> 01:18:49.994
Shit, my mom's been
fucking a dead guy for 30 years.

01:18:50.094 --> 01:18:51.120
I call him "Dad."

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.581
Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible.

01:18:53.681 --> 01:18:54.874
Melodrama coming from you

01:18:54.974 --> 01:18:56.918
seems about as natural
as an oral bowel movement.

01:18:57.018 --> 01:18:58.419
What do you want me to say,

01:18:58.519 --> 01:19:00.254
some of the things
you're saying are true?

01:19:00.354 --> 01:19:02.423
That's the way things are,
they're not gonna change.

01:19:02.523 --> 01:19:05.259
- Make them change.
- I can't, all right?

01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:06.719
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

01:19:06.819 --> 01:19:08.680
I can't make changes in my life
like that.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.098
If I could, I would.

01:19:10.198 --> 01:19:12.892
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

01:19:12.992 --> 01:19:15.019
on the big money
and the fabulous prizes.

01:19:15.119 --> 01:19:16.479
Who you kidding? You can so.

01:19:16.579 --> 01:19:18.690
Jesus H. Christ, I can't.

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:20.316
You're gonna sit there
and be miserable,

01:19:20.416 --> 01:19:23.444
because you don't have the guts
to face change?

01:19:23.544 --> 01:19:26.948
My mother told me once
that when I was 3 years old,

01:19:27.048 --> 01:19:28.950
my potty lid was closed.

01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:31.995
And instead of me lifting it,
I shit my pants.

01:19:32.095 --> 01:19:33.538
Lovely story.

01:19:33.638 --> 01:19:37.041
The point is I'm not the type of person
who disrupts things

01:19:37.141 --> 01:19:39.427
just so I can shit comfortably.

01:19:52.858 --> 01:19:56.602
Noich, noich, noich
Smoking weed, smoking weed

01:19:56.702 --> 01:19:58.813
Doing coke, drinking beers

01:19:58.913 --> 01:20:00.231
Pack of wraps, my good man.

01:20:00.331 --> 01:20:03.317
Time to kick back, drink some beers,
and smoke some weed.

01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:06.529
- Done poisoning the youth for today?
- Hell yes, whatever that means.

01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:08.740
Now it's time to head over to Atlantic,

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.917
drink some beers, get ripped,
and hopefully get laid.

01:20:12.044 --> 01:20:14.754
- One seventy-nine.
- Pay the good man.

01:20:15.464 --> 01:20:17.915
- Yeah, you close soon?
- In half an hour.

01:20:18.015 --> 01:20:20.376
We get off the same time every day.
We should hang out.

01:20:20.476 --> 01:20:22.295
- You get high?
- I should start.

01:20:22.395 --> 01:20:23.546
Wanna come to this party
with me tonight?

01:20:23.646 --> 01:20:25.506
There's gonna be
some pussy there, man.

01:20:25.606 --> 01:20:27.050
With you? I don't think so.

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:29.677
Oh, look at you.
"I don't hang out with drug dealers."

01:20:29.777 --> 01:20:31.429
Nothing personal.

01:20:31.529 --> 01:20:34.307
- What happened with that old guy?
- He died in the bathroom.

01:20:34.407 --> 01:20:36.392
Well, I heard he was jerking off
or something.

01:20:36.492 --> 01:20:38.144
I don't know, I wasn't watching.

01:20:38.244 --> 01:20:41.689
He probably saw that Caitlin chick.
I felt like beating it when I saw her.

01:20:41.789 --> 01:20:43.941
Come here, bitch. You like this, huh?

01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:45.659
- Is this what you want?
- Knock it off.

01:20:45.786 --> 01:20:49.363
- That used to be my girlfriend, all right?
- You used to go out with her?

01:20:49.463 --> 01:20:51.532
Yeah, well, I thought
we might be starting again.

01:20:51.632 --> 01:20:54.460
- Don't you already have a girlfriend?
- Yeah, Veronica.

01:20:54.586 --> 01:20:57.163
And what, you're gonna dump her
for that Caitlin chick?

01:20:57.263 --> 01:20:58.456
Maybe.

01:20:58.556 --> 01:21:00.208
I don't know, dude.
That Caitlin chick's nice.

01:21:00.308 --> 01:21:03.127
But I see that Veronica girl
doing shit for you all the time.

01:21:03.227 --> 01:21:06.422
I saw her rubbing your back,
fucking comes and brings your food.

01:21:06.522 --> 01:21:07.840
Didn't I see her change your tyre once?

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.592
Hey, hey, I jacked up the car.

01:21:09.692 --> 01:21:12.345
All she did was unloosen the nuts
and put the tyre on.

01:21:12.445 --> 01:21:15.481
- I don't know, she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

01:21:15.857 --> 01:21:17.141
I had some girlfriends too,

01:21:17.241 --> 01:21:19.811
but all they wanted from me
was weed and shit.

01:21:19.911 --> 01:21:21.062
Shit, my grandma used to say,

01:21:21.162 --> 01:21:24.857
"What's better, fucking,
a good plate with nothing on it..."

01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:26.109
No, wait. I fucked up.

01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:28.653
"What's a good plate
with nothing on it?"

01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:30.863
- Meaning?
- I don't know, she was senile and shit.

01:21:30.963 --> 01:21:33.574
She used to fucking piss herself
all the time

01:21:33.674 --> 01:21:35.243
and shit herself.

01:21:35.343 --> 01:21:38.663
Come on, Silent Bob. Let's get
the fuck out of this fucking gyp-joint

01:21:38.763 --> 01:21:42.716
with this fucking faggot, Dante.
You cock-smoker.

01:21:44.219 --> 01:21:46.295
There's a million
fine-looking women in the world,

01:21:46.395 --> 01:21:48.464
but they don't all bring you
lasagne at work.

01:21:48.564 --> 01:21:50.850
Most of them just cheat on you.

01:21:51.434 --> 01:21:53.185
Come on, limp dick.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:57.023 --> 01:21:58.357
He's right.

01:21:59.734 --> 01:22:01.110
I love her.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.479
So that's it.

01:22:03.579 --> 01:22:06.065
He doesn't love you any more.
He loves Caitlin.

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:08.734
- And he told you all of this?
- Pretty much.

01:22:08.834 --> 01:22:10.695
All except
the latent homosexuality part,

01:22:10.795 --> 01:22:12.663
that's just my theory.

01:22:13.373 --> 01:22:15.658
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, don't hold it against him.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:18.411
I mean, he just never
got Caitlin out of his system.

01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:21.297
It's not your fault. It's Dante.

01:22:22.757 --> 01:22:24.709
Look, I don't know thing one
about chicks,

01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:27.753
so if you gotta cry or something,
I can get out of here.

01:22:27.853 --> 01:22:29.555
- I'm not sad.
- You're not?

01:22:31.016 --> 01:22:32.091
What did you do that for?

01:22:32.191 --> 01:22:34.677
If you didn't wanna go out with me,
why didn't you say so?

01:22:34.777 --> 01:22:37.305
Instead, you pussyfoot around
and see that slut behind my back.

01:22:37.405 --> 01:22:40.141
- What are you talking about?
- You've been talking to her.

01:22:40.241 --> 01:22:42.310
- It was only a few times.
- And then you pull that shit.

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:44.520
Freaking out because
I've gone down on a couple guys.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.688
Oh, a couple?

01:22:45.788 --> 01:22:48.316
I'm not the one
trying to patch things up with my ex,

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:49.525
sneaking behind your back.

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:52.403
If you think that 37 dicks are a lot,
then you just wait.

01:22:52.503 --> 01:22:54.197
I'll put the hookers
in Times Square to shame

01:22:54.297 --> 01:22:55.781
with all the guys I go down on now.

01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:57.742
- Will you let me explain.
- Explain what?

01:22:57.842 --> 01:23:01.120
How you've been waiting
and were going to dump me for her?

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.331
- It isn't like that.
- Damn right it isn't like that.

01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:05.875
Because I won't let it be like that.
You want your slut?

01:23:05.975 --> 01:23:07.960
- Fine, the slut is yours.
- I don't want Caitlin.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.545
You don't know what you want,

01:23:09.645 --> 01:23:11.839
but I'm not going to sit here
holding your hand any more

01:23:11.939 --> 01:23:14.926
until you figure it out.
I've tried with you, Dante.

01:23:15.026 --> 01:23:17.053
I've encouraged you
to get out of this fucking dump

01:23:17.153 --> 01:23:20.181
and go back to school, to take charge
of your life and find direction.

01:23:20.281 --> 01:23:22.308
I even transferred
so you would be more inclined

01:23:22.408 --> 01:23:23.809
to go back to college if I was with you.

01:23:23.909 --> 01:23:27.396
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

01:23:27.496 --> 01:23:29.023
and wanted to see you pull yourself

01:23:29.123 --> 01:23:30.691
out of this senseless funk
that you've been in

01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:32.902
since that whore dumped you
so many years ago.

01:23:33.002 --> 01:23:35.780
And now you wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over some more?

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.165
- I don't wanna go...
- Of course not, not now.

01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:40.868
Now you're trying to snake out
of doing what you wanted to do.

01:23:40.968 --> 01:23:43.120
Well, I won't let you.
I want you to follow through,

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.373
so you can find out
what an idiot you are.

01:23:45.473 --> 01:23:48.042
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you that she will.

01:23:48.142 --> 01:23:50.878
When she dumps you again,
I want to laugh at you.

01:23:50.978 --> 01:23:53.881
Just so you realise that that was
what you gave up our relationship for.

01:23:53.981 --> 01:23:56.259
I'm just glad that Randal
had the balls to tell me.

01:23:56.359 --> 01:23:57.468
Randal?

01:23:57.568 --> 01:24:01.013
Having him tell me, that was
the weakest move. You're spineless.

01:24:01.113 --> 01:24:03.357
- Veronica, I love you.
- Fuck you.

01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:21.000
Dante?

01:24:53.283 --> 01:24:54.867
How's your eye?

01:24:55.535 --> 01:24:58.746
The swelling's not that bad,
but the FDS stings.

01:25:00.373 --> 01:25:03.500
- How's your neck?
- It's kind of hard to swallow.

01:25:04.878 --> 01:25:06.787
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

01:25:06.887 --> 01:25:08.247
Why did you tell Veronica

01:25:08.347 --> 01:25:10.166
that I was gonna dump her
to go back with Caitlin?

01:25:10.266 --> 01:25:13.419
- I thought I was doing you a favour.
- Jesus.

01:25:13.519 --> 01:25:16.088
You were always saying
how you can't initiate change yourself.

01:25:16.188 --> 01:25:18.891
- I thought I'd give you a hand.
- Thanks.

01:25:19.893 --> 01:25:21.469
You still didn't have to choke me.

01:25:21.569 --> 01:25:24.513
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

01:25:24.613 --> 01:25:28.100
- Why do you say that?
- Why do I say that? Randal...

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.268
- Forget it.
- No, really.

01:25:29.368 --> 01:25:31.896
- What did I do that was so wrong?
- What don't you do?

01:25:31.996 --> 01:25:35.149
Sometimes I think the reason you come
to work is to make my life miserable.

01:25:35.249 --> 01:25:36.776
How do you figure?

01:25:36.876 --> 01:25:39.779
- What time did you get to work today?
- Like 10:00 or 10 after.

01:25:39.879 --> 01:25:43.240
You were over half an hour late.
Then all you do is come in here.

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.658
Yeah, to talk to you.

01:25:44.758 --> 01:25:46.911
Which means the video store
is ostensibly closed.

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:48.788
Oh, it's not like I'm miles away.

01:25:48.888 --> 01:25:50.831
Unless you're out renting
at other video stores.

01:25:50.931 --> 01:25:54.126
Hermaphrodites.
I rented it so we could watch it together.

01:25:54.226 --> 01:25:55.669
You get me slapped with a fine,

01:25:55.769 --> 01:25:58.381
you argue with the customers
and I have to patch everything up.

01:25:58.481 --> 01:26:00.758
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating a corpse.

01:26:00.858 --> 01:26:03.344
And to top it all off,
you ruin my relationship.

01:26:03.444 --> 01:26:04.770
I mean, what's your encore?

01:26:04.938 --> 01:26:08.774
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

01:26:11.069 --> 01:26:14.522
You know what the real tragedy
about all this is?

01:26:14.622 --> 01:26:16.524
I'm not even supposed
to be here today.

01:26:16.624 --> 01:26:18.192
Oh, fuck you.

01:26:18.292 --> 01:26:19.785
Fuck you, pal.

01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:22.071
Jesus, there you go
trying to pass the buck.

01:26:22.171 --> 01:26:24.073
I'm the source of all your misery.

01:26:24.173 --> 01:26:27.952
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

01:26:28.052 --> 01:26:29.745
Who tried to win back his ex-girlfriend

01:26:29.845 --> 01:26:32.623
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

01:26:32.723 --> 01:26:35.467
You wanna blame somebody,
blame yourself.

01:26:36.052 --> 01:26:39.713
"I'm not even supposed to be here
today." You sound like an asshole.

01:26:39.813 --> 01:26:42.049
Jesus, nobody twisted your arm
to be here.

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:43.884
You're here of your own volition.

01:26:43.984 --> 01:26:46.429
You think the weight of the world
rests on your shoulders,

01:26:46.529 --> 01:26:49.557
like this place would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

01:26:49.657 --> 01:26:53.060
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.645
You push fucking buttons.

01:26:54.745 --> 01:26:57.614
Anybody can waltz in here
and do our jobs.

01:26:58.366 --> 01:27:01.152
You're so obsessed with making it
seem so much more epic,

01:27:01.252 --> 01:27:03.654
so much more important
than it really is.

01:27:03.754 --> 01:27:06.449
Christ, you work
in a convenience store, Dante.

01:27:06.549 --> 01:27:08.242
And badly, I might add.

01:27:08.342 --> 01:27:11.420
I work in a shitty video store.
Badly, as well.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.414
That guy Jay's got it right, man.

01:27:13.514 --> 01:27:15.749
He has no delusions
about what he does.

01:27:15.849 --> 01:27:18.085
Us, we like to make ourselves
seem so much more important

01:27:18.185 --> 01:27:19.879
than the people that come in here
to buy a paper,

01:27:19.979 --> 01:27:21.755
or God forbid, cigarettes.

01:27:21.855 --> 01:27:24.091
We look down on them,
as if we're so advanced.

01:27:24.191 --> 01:27:28.645
Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
then what are we doing working here?

01:27:46.915 --> 01:27:50.584
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I whipped the cat next door.

01:27:50.752 --> 01:27:51.827
Need a ride home?

01:27:51.927 --> 01:27:54.046
No, got one. Just pulled up.

01:27:54.547 --> 01:27:55.706
You working tomorrow?

01:27:55.806 --> 01:27:58.759
- Same time. What about you?
- I'm calling out.

01:27:59.135 --> 01:28:01.378
Going to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

01:28:01.478 --> 01:28:03.797
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

01:28:03.897 --> 01:28:05.216
You wanna grab a bite to eat
or something

01:28:05.316 --> 01:28:08.052
when you're done with that
and I get off work?

01:28:08.152 --> 01:28:09.970
I'll give you a call. Let you know.

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:11.138
All right.

01:28:11.238 --> 01:28:12.932
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

01:28:13.032 --> 01:28:16.018
- If you want, I can talk to her...
- No, thanks.

01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:17.978
I think I can handle it.

01:28:18.078 --> 01:28:20.572
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

01:28:20.949 --> 01:28:23.367
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.

01:28:24.244 --> 01:28:27.196
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

01:28:27.296 --> 01:28:29.990
- Why don't you wrangle for me?
- No.

01:28:30.090 --> 01:28:32.034
- Come on, just wrangle out the door.
- No.

01:28:32.134 --> 01:28:34.086
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

01:28:34.254 --> 01:28:38.689
Here comes Randal
He's a berserker

01:28:45.974 --> 01:28:47.474
You're closed.

01:31:39.272 --> 01:31:41.265
Smoking weed, smoking weed

01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:45.360
Noich, noich, noich
Smoking weed, smoking weed

01:31:46.305 --> 01:31:52.688
