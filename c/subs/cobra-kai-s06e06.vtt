00:06.297 --> 00:08.299
[dramatic music plays]

00:16.933 --> 00:23.355
Welcome, competitors, senseis, sponsors,
and esteemed guests to Barcelona,

00:23.356 --> 00:27.609
this year's home
of the world's greatest karate tournament,

00:27.610 --> 00:30.904
the Sekai Taikai.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.449
[cheering]

00:38.455 --> 00:42.124
The Sekai Taikai boasts
a rich and proud history.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.208
And if you are here,

00:43.209 --> 00:47.504
it's because you embody
all that the Sekai Taikai stands for.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.799
Leadership, respect, sportsmanship.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.761
Captains, step forward
and tie on your headbands.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.847
[dramatic music continues]

01:10.153 --> 01:12.863
[Gunther] Captains, you will have
the honor and privilege

01:12.864 --> 01:16.325
to compete in
our televised tournament of champions.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.826
But that is only

01:17.827 --> 01:21.371
if your dojo does well enough
in our team competitions

01:21.372 --> 01:23.332
to make it to the final four.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.708
Once the tournament is over,

01:24.709 --> 01:28.505
we will then tally
all the points your dojos have earned.

01:29.005 --> 01:33.425
The dojo with the most points
wins the Sekai Taikai.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.427
- Team events begin tomorrow.
- Did you know?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.012
- [Gunther] Each event counts.
- No.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.807
- [Gunther] They will all be a surprise.
- I swear.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.518
[Gunther] But today,
it's about enjoying our host city

01:42.519 --> 01:44.353
and making new friends.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.729
Or enemies.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.899
[tense music plays]

01:50.401 --> 01:53.237
[Gunther] We have a field trip arranged
for our competitors.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.696
And for our senseis,

01:54.697 --> 01:57.616
a cocktail mixer
with our distinguished sponsors,

01:57.617 --> 02:01.078
some of the world's finest
martial arts brands.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.582
It's a beautiful day
to make a first impression.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.377
And I suggest you enjoy it,

02:08.378 --> 02:13.133
because tomorrow,
your lives change forever.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.259
Good luck,

02:15.260 --> 02:19.221
and welcome to the Sekai Taikai!

02:19.222 --> 02:21.181
[cheering]

02:21.182 --> 02:23.268
[dramatic music plays]

02:33.945 --> 02:36.072
[upbeat Spanish music plays]

02:44.414 --> 02:48.208
All right. Listen, go get your room keys.
Get everyone else settled in. All right?

02:48.209 --> 02:50.420
We gotta take care of the driver.
Go ahead.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.384
What a shit show this is, man.
You know, Tory's here 'cause of you.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.636
Wait a second. After what we just saw,
you're coming after me?

02:59.637 --> 03:01.847
Tory's mother just died,
and you wanted her to fight.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.017
All you did was feed her anger.
No wonder she went back to Kreese.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.187
You don't have to worry about that.
Mark my words, Kreese is a dead man.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.105
Oh, that's gonna solve all our problems.

03:10.106 --> 03:13.859
If you pull your typical crap here,
we are gonna get kicked out. Hear me?

03:13.860 --> 03:17.989
Cobra Kai is one dojo out of 16.
It's not us against them anymore.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.532
If Kreese gets in our head,
we've already lost.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.910
We're not losing.
I'm taking him out of commission.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.077
No, you're not.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.663
You are here as a Miyagi-Do sensei,
all right?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.999
We may not like it,
but we're in this together.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.253
No. We're here next to each other,
not together.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.257
Which room do you guys want?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.675
Uh, I'll... I'll... I'll go with you.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.388
- Really? I figured Robby and I would--
- No. I'll bunk with <i>El Serpiente</i>.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.181
You fart in your sleep.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.768
Erroneous. And he who observed it
served it, by the way.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.062
- Whoever said the rhyme did the crime.
- You just rhymed.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.397
- You said the rhyme first.
- But you also rhymed.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.524
- [Hawk] Okay, but...
- Thank God we aren't boys.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.736
[Hawk] So hypocritical!
What are you talking about?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.237
Are you okay?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.324
- [Hawk] You rhymed first.
- How could Tory go back to Cobra Kai?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.492
I thought things had changed.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.744
[ominous music plays]

04:05.620 --> 04:06.913
Whoa.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.208
So you're the famous Miyagi-Do.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.001
We have heard about you,

04:12.710 --> 04:14.379
but I do not know why.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.257
You do not look like much.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.092
Yeah?

04:20.009 --> 04:21.844
You'll see better
when you step on the mat.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.972
Come on, guys. It's not worth it.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.685
Robby's right. Forget about them, okay?
They're just any other dojo here.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.983
[Robby] Tory. Hey, wait.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.194
[ominous music plays]

04:43.074 --> 04:44.616
[speaks Korean]

04:44.617 --> 04:45.952
[Kwon laughs]

04:46.494 --> 04:48.621
- [Hawk] Should we be worried about him?
- [Miguel] No.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.417
- Robby's gonna be fine.
- I wouldn't be fine.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.210
What?

04:55.211 --> 04:57.796
Sounds like
things are a little tense there.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.507
Do I need to come out
and get everything back on track?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.426
Maybe visit a beach or two?

05:02.427 --> 05:05.053
- You'd probably handle it better than us.
- [shower running]

05:05.054 --> 05:06.764
I haven't even gotten hold of Chozen yet.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.308
Hopefully, he meets us
at this cocktail mixer.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.270
Cocktail mixer. Wow!
Things are really terrible there, huh?

05:13.271 --> 05:14.938
<i>No. Hey, this is all business.</i>

05:14.939 --> 05:16.606
Mingling with the sponsors is my chance

05:16.607 --> 05:19.484
to make a good first impression
for Miyagi-Do on the world stage.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.153
Just turn on that salesman charm.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.488
<i>You'll knock 'em dead.</i>

05:23.865 --> 05:25.782
Got more water pressure
out of a damn garden hose.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.576
Your roommate, on the other hand...

05:27.577 --> 05:30.830
Shower's just sneezing on me.
I'm calling the front desk.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.920
Don't touch that. They're on sensors.
If you move them, we're gonna get charged.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.297
Eight dollars for a beer?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.967
- Eight euros. It's nine dollars.
- [Johnny] Nine dollars?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.801
Hello? Uh...

05:44.802 --> 05:49.139
<i>Necesito nuevo cabeza de,</i> uh... shower.
How do you say sh--

05:49.140 --> 05:50.766
Did you just call me a douche?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.643
This is my new favorite show.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.521
[knocking on door]

05:59.317 --> 06:00.400
[ominous drum roll]

06:00.401 --> 06:02.612
Get moving. The buses are leaving.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.863
[Tory exhales]
I'm not here for a field trip.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.783
Your team is waiting.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.826
Yeah, I'm not here for them either.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.206
Let me be clear.
I did not want you on this team.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.873
And I still don't.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.043
Well, I am. Which means
you didn't have a better choice.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.796
Hm. I saw your potential right away.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.673
But I also saw that you're a rat.

06:23.674 --> 06:28.178
Whining, and distracted
by split loyalties, the boyfriend.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.805
And by you breaking my hand.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.391
You broke your own hand.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.310
- I knew you were not a leader.
- [Tory] I don't wanna be.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.397
I only took the captain's spot
so I can be the last one fighting.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.733
And you'll be the last one losing.

06:46.948 --> 06:47.864
[door closes]

06:47.865 --> 06:49.784
I don't have anything to say to you.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.663
I know you're struggling.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.625
But you made the right decision.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.628
You will make your mother proud.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.337
I hope so.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.631
I know so.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.967
You know,
you don't have to like your team.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.764
Sometimes we have to play... nice
to get what we want.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.230
[Johnny] Better be food at this thing.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.108
[Daniel] You just concentrate
on holding it together with Kreese.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.486
[Johnny chuckles] Please. I'm not the one
who punched out Silver at a charity event.

07:26.487 --> 07:30.283
I shoved him, and he flopped. It wasn't...
How do you even know about that?

07:31.075 --> 07:33.618
If you talk to any of the sponsors,
just make sure--

07:33.619 --> 07:36.830
Yeah, I know. Miyagi-Do pride.
Don't be a dumb American. I got it.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.748
All right.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.085
I'll be fine as soon as I get
some Spanish chimichangas in me.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.256
[upbeat Spanish music plays]

07:46.674 --> 07:50.552
The truth is, Miyagi-Do was never
a competitive dojo until recently.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.095
I was my sensei's first student.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.475
It's been my life's honor to spread
his teachings to the next generation.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.903
Hey, man. One per customer.

08:07.904 --> 08:08.945
Excuse me?

08:08.946 --> 08:10.405
You took the last two steaks.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.782
Oh, one is for a friend.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.869
But even if it weren't, I'm entitled
to enjoy as many pieces as I like.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.621
Yeah? Maybe I'm entitled to stop you.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.956
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, sorry about that.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.959
- Excuse me one minute.
- [scoffs]

08:23.920 --> 08:26.213
What happened to literally
everything we talked about?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.924
- The guy's probably a sponsor.
- The guy's a steak stealer.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.550
So let him steal the steak.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.803
This is our moment, Johnny.
Let's not blow it over nothing.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.096
All right, all right.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.183
[ominous music plays]

08:42.438 --> 08:43.481
[camera shutter clicks]

08:44.398 --> 08:47.692
Now, everybody smile and say, "Barcelona."

08:47.693 --> 08:49.486
One, two, three.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.947
[all] Barcelona.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.823
[photographer] Louder. Barcelona!

08:53.824 --> 08:55.283
[all] Barcelona!

08:55.284 --> 08:57.244
[photographer] Sexy. Everybody...

08:57.245 --> 09:00.122
Going out of their way to let us know
how special the captains are.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.791
Yeah, I'm getting that.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.751
[Devon] It seems like
everyone already knows each other.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.505
- [indistinct shouting]
- I'll have you right here!

09:08.422 --> 09:10.216
It's not exactly friendly either.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.841
Maybe it's like prison.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.845
Just punch the toughest guy
square in the jaw on day one.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.724
- Hm.
- Yeah, there are a lot of tough guys.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.644
[photographer speaks Spanish]

09:22.645 --> 09:23.895
Smile. More.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.023
Some of these boys are cute, huh?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.569
[photographer speaks Spanish]

09:30.570 --> 09:32.113
All right, show me the tongue.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.739
One, two, three. Sexier.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.158
Maybe you already got dibs.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.119
And one more.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.163
You there in the back, smile.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.040
Show some emotion.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.417
Okay, let's get one more.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.294
Okay, never mind. We're done.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.380
[in Korean] There she goes again.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.923
Captain, my ass.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.051
[foreboding music plays]

10:03.769 --> 10:06.438
[woman in English] My company
is always looking for new partnerships.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.649
We handle international licensing
for dojo-specific gear

10:09.650 --> 10:12.611
while also providing
official Sekai Taikai apparel.

10:12.612 --> 10:18.742
That reminds me of something.
Do you have... any idea how old this is?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.828
[mysterious music plays]

10:22.288 --> 10:25.416
Based on the design,
it appears to be 1950s era.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.419
- Maybe even 1940s.
- Wow.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.254
Where did you acquire this,
Sensei LaRusso?

10:31.255 --> 10:34.091
These captain bands
don't exactly pop up on eBay.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.885
It belonged to my sensei.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.970
Must be quite a story.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.389
I'm sure it is.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.440
- What are these things made of?
- Yes, uh, those are acrylic.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.696
They don't hurt that bad. You might wanna
go back to the lab on these.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.784
All the Sekai Taikai champions
use and stand by these products.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.578
These your models? I got
way better-looking kids at my dojo.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.665
- Let me show you some photos.
- That's not really the criteria.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.167
The sponsorship opportunities
are for champions.

11:09.168 --> 11:13.047
Oh yeah? What is that? Fifty bucks a day,
opportunity to do some skin flicks?

11:13.631 --> 11:16.299
I went down that modeling road.
It leads to nowhere good.

11:16.300 --> 11:20.638
No. I mean the best-performing dojos
and champions are well taken care of.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.307
Like paying for college?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.810
Yeah. And then some.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.354
I'm Sensei Lawrence, by the way.
Miyagi-Do Karate.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.650
Very deep-rooted dojo. Diversified,
inclusified, all those things.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.945
The kids would make
a great addition to your brand.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.279
Fine craftsmanship here.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.407
[man] Be careful.
That point is very sharp.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.951
Oh, don't worry.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.369
I know how to handle a blade.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.454
I keep my own

11:47.248 --> 11:48.165
very close.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.667
Very impressive <i>eunjangdo.</i>

11:50.668 --> 11:55.463
Yes. There's a lot of sentimental value
here as well as historical value,

11:55.464 --> 11:58.466
but it's still deadly in the wrong hands.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.512
Or the right hands. [chuckles]

12:03.305 --> 12:05.682
One good swing of these
could get the job done just as quick.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.766
[man] Well, uh...

12:06.767 --> 12:09.603
Well, I think most people
would rather be holding the knife.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.604
- What do you think?
- Uh...

12:11.605 --> 12:14.817
It's not about the weapon.
It's about who's using it, right?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.044
Plan on avoiding me the entire tournament?

12:35.629 --> 12:36.464
No.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.509
But I don't know what you want me to say.
I made my decision.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.012
You could have at least told me.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.640
I wanted to, but you...
you would've talked me out of it.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.351
So, when Kreese came to you,
this was what it was about?

12:50.352 --> 12:52.772
He's using you. You know that, right?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.815
He helped you
when you had no other options.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.609
Okay, but you have options, Tory.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.819
Or... had.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.738
What options?

13:01.405 --> 13:04.115
You can't honestly tell me I would've
gotten a fair shake at Miyagi-Do.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.285
Sam was always gonna be the captain.
They were waiting for an excuse.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.288
That is not true. Look.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.832
[gentle music plays]

13:12.833 --> 13:14.543
I know you've made your decision.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.297
And I know it couldn't have been easy.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.550
And I am so sorry about your mom.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.889
You said we'd stick together.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.310
We shouldn't talk about this now.

13:32.061 --> 13:32.895
Tory...

13:40.486 --> 13:44.489
[kids] Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad!

13:44.490 --> 13:45.907
[Hawk] What the hell is this?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.909
[kids] Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, Vlad!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.869
- [Vlad grunts]
- [crowd groans]

13:49.870 --> 13:51.288
[Vlad in Russian] Damn it!

13:55.251 --> 13:57.127
Not even close.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.129
No one beats mine.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.382
Team USA.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.677
Everyone knows
America's best at everything, right?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.971
[laughter]

14:07.972 --> 14:09.264
[Kwon] Let's see! Let's see!

14:09.265 --> 14:11.975
USA! USA!

14:11.976 --> 14:14.561
[crowd] USA! USA!

14:14.562 --> 14:16.271
- [Kwon] Come on!
- [crowd] USA!

14:16.272 --> 14:19.358
- Are you scared? Come on!
- USA! USA! USA!

14:20.526 --> 14:24.237
So this really is a mystery, then.
He never talked to you about it?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.823
No, never.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.199
Is this blood?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.828
[Gunther] The tournaments
were even more brutal back then.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.874
There's one man who might know
something about this.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.041
Master Serrano.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.918
Who... who's that?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.044
[Kim Da-Eun] Serrano.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.755
Legendary champion.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.966
Everybody knows this.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.136
I haven't heard that name in a long time.
Is he even still alive?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.681
He stopped coming to tournaments
a few years back, but he's still with us.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.226
He was even living here in Barcelona
at one point.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.812
I can try and get in touch.
Maybe get a number or address.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.522
That would be incredible.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.650
I would love to speak with him
and just, you know,

15:03.027 --> 15:04.152
try and get some answers.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.071
What the hell
are you doing at this tournament?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.575
Well, I owe some people here
a little payback.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.786
You know, Johnny,
I've always taken it easy on you

15:13.662 --> 15:15.288
because I had a soft spot for you.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.749
But things change.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.836
Now I'm gonna show you
what the true definition of "no mercy" is.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.504
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.757
What if I tell everyone
about your little prison escape?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.593
All the charges were dropped.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.305
I mean, who would go against
a veteran with PTSD,

15:31.972 --> 15:34.807
innocent of the crime
for which he was convicted,

15:34.808 --> 15:37.394
and then he had to escape
to save his life?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.773
Self-defense takes many forms, Johnny.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.774
But you already know that,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.193
because, after all,

15:45.903 --> 15:47.237
you're Miyagi-Do.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.324
Hey. Whatever is going on here,
it stops now.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.329
Well, I was just telling your employee
I would love to speak to his supervisor.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.998
Okay, listen. We don't need
to do this anymore, all right?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.668
We all have too much at stake here.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.505
On the contrary.
Some of us have nothing to lose.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.464
But not you, LaRusso.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.509
You've got a lot to lose.

16:09.301 --> 16:13.179
You've got a lot
that could be taken away from you.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.723
- You wanna level threats, son of a bitch?
- Come on.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.101
- All right, back off.
- [Chozen] Get hands off of me.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.269
- [security guard] I need your badge.
- [speaks Japanese]

16:20.270 --> 16:21.229
[Chozen grunts]

16:21.230 --> 16:22.480
[Chozen chuckles]

16:22.481 --> 16:24.733
I am with Miyagi-Do.

16:25.317 --> 16:29.070
Learn name. Miyagi-Do Karate.
[speaks Japanese]

16:29.071 --> 16:29.988
He's drunk.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.949
Miyagi-Do!

16:32.449 --> 16:34.075
Oh, ho, ho!

16:34.076 --> 16:35.243
My guy.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.122
- [bartender] Yes, sir?
- Long Island iced tea, eh?

16:38.956 --> 16:39.998
Two.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.127
One for this fist, one for this fist.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.546
Double fist! [laughs]

16:48.590 --> 16:49.925
[Miguel] This isn't a good idea.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.260
Hey, toughest guy in prison, right?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.469
You said that.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.180
No. No, I didn't say that.
I don't agree with that idea at all.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.725
You know what? This is dumb.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.559
- I said that.
- [Hawk] Whatever.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.477
[Yoon] Yo.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.814
Are you really
the best your dojo has to offer?

17:04.398 --> 17:09.028
- I'm tough enough to kick your punk ass.
- Please, you are not even captain.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.655
- Where is he?
- [Robby] I'm right here.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.993
Come on, guys. We're leaving.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.955
[Kwon] You always
walk away from challenge?

17:20.622 --> 17:24.209
Or is it because girlfriend
is on our team?

17:24.793 --> 17:26.336
[kids laugh]

17:26.837 --> 17:27.671
Robby.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.507
Hey. You got this.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.175
Show 'em what's up.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.261
[tense music plays]

17:38.640 --> 17:40.100
What, I gotta kick above that line?

17:43.437 --> 17:44.813
[Kwon] What, too easy for you?

17:45.314 --> 17:47.524
Okay, let's make bet, then.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.276
You kick,

17:50.110 --> 17:51.070
then I kick.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.197
You win, you get my room.

17:54.198 --> 17:57.409
I win, I get your room.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.412
You're on.

18:01.121 --> 18:01.955
[Miguel] Robby.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.625
[tense music continues]

18:06.502 --> 18:10.714
Dude, you're gambling our rooms away?
Isn't that, like, a team decision?

18:11.381 --> 18:14.093
I'm not gambling.
I'm getting us an extra room.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.221
That's gambling. He's gambling.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.473
[music stops]

18:20.849 --> 18:22.768
[tranquil music plays]

18:25.729 --> 18:27.898
I get why you did it.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.066
That makes one person.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.026
[chuckles]

18:35.114 --> 18:38.032
So, how are things going over there?
Everyone hates me, right?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.618
They're worried about you.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.994
They're worried about Robby too.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.498
- What do you mean?
- We need him on his game.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.043
And... this

18:49.503 --> 18:52.673
has just... taken him off of it.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.596
I thought... for sure
that this was my only choice.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.599
Now that I'm here,

19:03.892 --> 19:04.726
I don't know.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.896
[Sam] Devon.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.565
Let's go.

19:17.156 --> 19:17.990
Sam, wait.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.626
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.629
I... I didn't want things to be like this.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.717
I don't know what it's like
to lose a parent.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.304
I know you made your decision
under pressure.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.266
Honestly, the only reason
I'm so hurt is because...

19:47.895 --> 19:49.188
I thought we were friends.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.608
I would have helped you.

19:53.817 --> 19:58.070
I just wish you would have come to me,
or to Robby even.

19:58.071 --> 20:02.075
Yeah, I did. I went to Robby
when Kreese first came to me.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.620
But I had to make this decision on my own,

20:05.454 --> 20:07.164
knowing what it would mean to him,

20:08.081 --> 20:09.790
to you, to everyone.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.668
If you wanna own this choice,

20:12.794 --> 20:14.086
then I can respect that,

20:14.087 --> 20:15.589
even if I disagree with it.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.842
But just know
that when we meet on the mat,

20:19.509 --> 20:20.510
whenever that is,

20:21.595 --> 20:22.596
I won't hesitate.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.349
Maybe it won't come to that.

20:27.809 --> 20:28.684
It will.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.771
[tense music plays]

20:36.360 --> 20:38.277
Okay, just give it a good running start.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.613
That Russian guy that went before you
jumped way too early.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.407
- The physics behind--
- I'm telling him. I know the physics.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.243
I'm going to a school
world-renowned for it.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.661
- My God.
- Maybe you've heard of it.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.454
Sure. "I'm going to MIT." I get it.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.458
- Hey, guys, please. Will you quit it?
- Come on.

20:53.961 --> 20:54.835

Please, Chozen. Please.
Let me get you back to the room. Okay?

22:09.578 --> 22:10.537
Come on.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.872
How come no steak?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.790
What kind of place is this?

22:14.791 --> 22:19.837
Isn't it a shame that not everyone
can represent our sport with decorum?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.255
Get off my back.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.757

22:22.758 --> 22:25.009
Where've you been?
Why are you drinking so much?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.554
I went Okinawa.

I can go check.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.152
No! Not necessary.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.862

22:44.863 --> 22:46.948
Shower Man wearing a towel!

22:48.241 --> 22:49.701
- Okay.
- [Chozen] I was ready.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.535
I even bought flower.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.205
Flower? What... what flower?

22:53.789 --> 22:54.664
For Kumiko.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.461
Oh shit. This is about Kukomo.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.922
I bought flower.

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
I bought...

23:05.550 --> 23:06.593
that flower.

Relax. Everything's gonna be okay.

Kumiko!

Yeah. Somebody said
it wasn't gonna be a gamble.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.796
I didn't wanna get involved.

23:43.797 --> 23:47.175
I told you to stay away from Cobra Kai.
It's so simple.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.885
If it's simple,
why don't you follow your own advice?

23:49.886 --> 23:52.639
- What are you talking about?
- We all saw you talking to Tory.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.267
