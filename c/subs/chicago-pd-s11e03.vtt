00:06.131 --> 00:06.715
- OK. I'm headed out.

00:07.590 --> 00:08.800
- With all you've been working,

00:08.842 --> 00:10.176
I can't believe you're
picking up extra shifts.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.136
- Oh,
they need Spanish speakers.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.595
Plus, it's important.

00:12.637 --> 00:13.513
- I know, I know.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.681
I'm actually right behind you.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.224
I got to pick up Mack
from hockey.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.018
- You know, I think her skates
are getting tight again.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.185
- I keep telling her
to stop growing.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.353
Bag?
- Yeah.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.022
I've been, uh,
trying to pick up

00:22.063 --> 00:23.523
extra carpool and stuff

00:23.565 --> 00:24.941
since you've been back at work.
- Oh, stop, stop, stop.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.193
We're in this together.
Rising boats, all that.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.362
Where the hell are my keys?

00:29.404 --> 00:30.655
Thanks.
- Rising tides.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.240
- What?
- Rising tides, that's what--

00:32.282 --> 00:33.450
never mind.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.535
Um, yeah,

00:35.577 --> 00:38.079
Mack can have this
for lunch tomorrow.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.831
I think she left her lunch box
at school.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.915
- Oh, you know what?

00:40.957 --> 00:43.043
I found my old one
in the basement.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.544
- What is it?

00:44.586 --> 00:45.837
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers?

00:45.879 --> 00:48.340
- Yeah, it's cool, like me.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.966
- It's vintage, like you.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.177
Oh, her permission slip.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.553
She lost the few ones.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.929
It's due tomorrow, so--
- OK.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.222
Third time's a charm.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.515
What else you got for me?

01:02.645 --> 01:04.230
- At some point,
we got kind of good at this.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.107
- Indeed we did.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.234
- See you tomorrow morning.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.819
- Yes ma'am. Be safe.

Trudy Platt still drinking
rookies' tears down there?

02:03.873 --> 02:05.417
- Good to the last drop.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.460
- Appreciate you putting in for
this detail.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.921
These illegals--what a mess.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.339

of Venezuela.

- What are you,
the woke police, too?

02:14.759 --> 02:15.927
Danny.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.637
- Yes, sir?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.472
- There's three of you
on this detail tonight.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.476
Burgess, intelligence.
- Hey.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.478
- Danny Alvarado is one of ours

Hi.
- Hi.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.649
- I'll show you the drill.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.568
Between 10:00 p.m.
and 6:00 a.m.,

02:31.609 --> 02:33.319
it's just women and children
in the lobby.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.946
Men, got to stay out here.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.531
Over here is numb nut alley.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.367
You got your weed dealers,
your gang recruiters,

02:39.409 --> 02:42.037
a couple of vatos
who will sell you a green card

02:42.078 --> 02:43.329
if you got the cash.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.206
You're just here
to keep the peace.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.875
There's no yelling,
no fighting.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.836
They use drugs or alcohol
on our property, they're gone.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.465
Relieve themselves
in our lovely shrubbery, gone.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.383
Most of this job tonight
is what you don't do.

If somebody's cold?
Not your job.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.637

Definitely not your job.

these people are decent.

They're law abiding.

They've just been
through hell--

03:16.529 --> 03:18.990
Venezuela, I mean,
they're running out of food.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.868
And I can tell you, he gets
more charming over time.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.371
But there isn't enough time
left on this Earth.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.254
- We came here together.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.590
We were going to live together
when all--

06:22.632 --> 06:25.093
when all this was over.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.514

- Yes.
- OK.

Did you maybe
see the shooter's face,

06:34.853 --> 06:36.146
hear him say anything?

06:36.187 --> 06:40.358
Maybe you saw somebody else
inside the car.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.110
- I was only trying to live.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.492
- I can't get anyone
to talk to me either.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.702
- Where these people came from,

06:50.744 --> 06:52.412
the police
are not their friends.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.330
- No. Voight's here.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.916
- OK, yeah, uh-huh.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.002

24.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.628
She was carrying
her Venezuelan ID.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.880
She caught three bullets.

One cut her femoral,
she died on scene.

probably gonna make it.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.678

07:08.720 --> 07:09.804
- Stolen last night
in Tinley Park.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.097
Kev's on his way there now

07:11.139 --> 07:12.891
to see if any cameras
caught the theft.

07:12.932 --> 07:13.892
- Everybody is looking for it;

07:13.933 --> 07:15.560
Sheriff's, ISP, the whole crew.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.188
- Victims all
Venezuelan nationals?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.565
- A lot of people in this town
are unhappy about this,

07:20.607 --> 07:21.649
this whole situation.

07:21.691 --> 07:22.984
- This feels like a hate crime.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.028
- Yeah, there's gonna be
a lot of eyes on this.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.199
Well, let's work it fast
and clean.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.201
- Sergeant Voight,

07:31.242 --> 07:32.452
uh, Danny Alvarado.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.245
I was on the overnight
with Officer Burgess.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.747
- Yeah?
- Uh...

07:35.789 --> 07:38.208
Look, this is my
assigned district, sir.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.377
And this thing, it's--

07:40.418 --> 07:42.045
it's hit me pretty hard.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.798
I'm just--I'm wondering if
I could join your team on it.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.009
My sergeant's
already signed off,

07:48.051 --> 07:49.135
and it would mean the world
to me.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.387
- Yeah, well,

07:50.428 --> 07:51.805
Burgess will be running point,
take her wing.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.306
- Thank you, sir.
I'll do you right.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.226
- Let's go, Danny.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.769
- OK. What's the story?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.479
- Well, the story is,
we struck out, Sarge.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.398
The only camera we had was
on a doorbell down the block.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.442
So we never caught the
actual theft of the SUV.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.820
- Ballistics ran the groove
pattern from a slug recovered

08:06.861 --> 08:08.279
in one of the victims,
and it's a match

08:08.321 --> 08:09.781
to a weapon
from a gas station robbery

08:09.823 --> 08:10.949
two years ago.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.158
- And the robbery
hooks in with this?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.536
- Uh-huh.
CPD had a person of interest.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.495
Can somebody grab that picture?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.080
- Gotcha.
- Thanks.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.748
Um, CPD had
a person of interest,

08:18.790 --> 08:20.083
but they couldn't get
the charges to stick.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.418
They didn't have
enough evidence.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.752
This is our guy.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.922
Here, James Pleasant,
pride of Rogers Park.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.507
Guy's a real peach.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.925
These are his socials here.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.761
"Mass deportation of vermin."
- Wow.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.388
"You're not welcome
if you're not white."

08:33.430 --> 08:35.598
- "What's the correct way
to stare at a Venezuelan?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.350
Down the barrel of a gun."

08:37.392 --> 08:39.102
- Well, just one problem.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.812
- It's not against the law
to be a jackass.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.439
- We got no reason
to kick this guy's door.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.690
- Mm.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.444
- What do you have, Danny?

08:47.485 --> 08:48.737
- Uh, I mean, maybe it's weak,

08:48.778 --> 08:50.780
but this guy, Pleasant,
lives with his sister.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.574
She's got an outstanding
serviceable warrant

08:52.615 --> 08:53.783
for shoplifting.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.618
- Sounds like
an invitation to me.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.455

08:58.496 --> 08:59.456
- Front door secure.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.415

09:03.335 --> 09:05.170
Chicago PD, open up.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.256
- What do you want?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.550
- Brenda Pleasant, we have
a warrant for her arrest.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.676
- She ain't here.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.719
- Just open the door, man,

09:12.761 --> 09:13.720
or we're gonna open it for you,

09:13.762 --> 09:15.388
and your day does not improve.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.809
[door clicks]

09:19.851 --> 09:21.186
- I'm telling you,
my sister ain't here.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.729
- We can't take your word
for that.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.858
- OK. See for yourself.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.487
What the hell are
they doing back there?

09:30.528 --> 09:31.821
- Oh, no, don't worry
about them, brother.

09:31.863 --> 09:32.739
Worry about us.
- Where is she?

09:32.781 --> 09:34.324
Where's your sister?

09:34.366 --> 09:35.909
- My sister is a middle-aged
woman who sometimes walks out

09:35.950 --> 09:37.827
of CVS with a new curling iron.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.496
Wasn't my turn
to keep tabs on her.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.747
- What's this?

09:40.789 --> 09:41.831
- Hey, man, that's legal.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.750
- About up to 30 grams, right?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.210
- Oh.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.753
This is over.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.213
Got an eye for it.
- Pretty good at it, too.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.631
It's like one of those
Stupid Human Tricks.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.965
- What is this?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.300
You can't come in here
looking for my sister

09:52.342 --> 09:53.593
and then search my house.
- It was in plain view.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.678
- Where were you
this morning, James?

09:54.719 --> 09:55.845
- I thought this
was about weed?

09:55.887 --> 09:57.639
- Where were you
this morning, James?

09:57.681 --> 09:59.099
- At my cabin, bitch.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.725
- Uh-uh.
Call her bitch again--

10:00.767 --> 10:01.893
- Let's go.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.318
Did you see anyone
when you were at your cabin?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.112
Can anyone vouch for you?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.613
- Sure,

10:13.655 --> 10:15.573
two deer and a wild turkey.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.867
- Yeah, that's what I thought

10:17.909 --> 10:20.912
because the evidence
is irrefutable, James.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.498
The gun used to kill
Raquel Bolivar this morning,

10:23.540 --> 10:26.334
same gun used
in the gas station robbery.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.464
- I pawned that gun years ago.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.882
- You got a receipt for that?

10:32.924 --> 10:34.050
- You got a receipt for the tux
you rented for prom?

10:34.092 --> 10:36.511
That many years ago.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.054
Love how you think
there's only one guy in town

10:38.096 --> 10:40.724
who hates these people
enough to do this.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.517
Sure, I'm guilty--

10:42.559 --> 10:44.894
guilty of defending our nation
from these parasites.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.896
[knocking on door]

10:46.938 --> 10:49.190
[door clicks]

10:49.232 --> 10:50.734
- Tollbooth cameras caught
Pleasant going

10:50.775 --> 10:51.943
to and from his cabin.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.737
He also used a credit card
in New Troy

10:53.778 --> 10:54.946
20 minutes before the shooting.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.532
So his alibi's good.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.533
- Thanks.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.492
- Sorry.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.581
- Told you I didn't do it.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.916
Wish I did.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.043
Those people deserve
what they got.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.919
[dark music]

11:09.961 --> 11:11.546
Your people.
- Say it again.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.881
Say it again.
- Danny--

11:12.922 --> 11:13.840
- Say it again.
Say "you people" again, say it.

11:13.882 --> 11:14.883
- Danny, listen to me.
- Say it.

11:14.924 --> 11:15.967
- Danny!
- [laughs]

11:16.009 --> 11:17.052
- Say it. Say it.
- Listen to me!

11:17.093 --> 11:18.470
- Hey, get him out of here.
- Out!

11:18.511 --> 11:20.805
Jesus, out.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.640
[door slams]

11:22.682 --> 11:23.641
- What the hell?

11:23.683 --> 11:24.934
- I'm not--

11:24.976 --> 11:26.144
I'm not normally like that, OK?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.437
I'm never in the box like that.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.482
I just wasn't
expecting him to--

11:30.523 --> 11:31.483
you know?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
Look, it's just this--

11:34.986 --> 11:37.572
this whole goddamn thing, OK?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.783
And I am--I'm sorry.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.745
* *

11:43.787 --> 11:45.622
- OK.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.832
I know. I get it.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.125
What we saw is ugly,

11:49.167 --> 11:53.046
and the world feels
real ugly after that.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.422
I wanted it
to be that guy, too.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.590
It is not.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.926
Now we go find who it is.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.094
That's it.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.889
- Yeah, OK.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.518
[sighs]
Yeah, yeah.

12:15.151 --> 12:15.318
.

12:15.360 --> 12:15.777
- You been home?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.570
- No.

12:17.612 --> 12:18.780
- Did you sleep?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.282
- Uh, a few hours ago,
patrol found the SUV

12:21.324 --> 12:23.868
used in the shooting abandoned
in the Dan Ryan Woods,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.245
fully engulfed in flames.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.788
- So no DNA?
- No.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.581
It was torched by the time
they could get trucks in there.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.459
But our subpoena with
the vehicle's LoJack data

12:31.501 --> 12:32.669
came through.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.004
An hour before the shooting,

12:34.045 --> 12:36.214
the SUV was at a documented
open air drug market

12:36.256 --> 12:37.841
in Riverdale.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.217
- It's thin.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.469
- It's where we are.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.138
- All right,
so go shake the trees.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.514
Take Alvarado with you.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.307
He hanging in?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.684
- Yeah, he's doing fine.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.020
[door shuts]

12:51.187 --> 12:53.231
[tense music]

12:53.273 --> 12:54.733
- Yo, we got to skate.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.734
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.110
Bad idea, gentlemen.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.611
- Whose car is this?

12:58.653 --> 12:59.904
- Never seen it.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.489
- That's not the answer
that I'm looking for.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.368
Oh, look at this,
Danny, plain view.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.661
- That ain't ours.
We ain't into that stuff.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.788
- No?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.166
See, we sent some of my guys
to buy dope for me last night.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.542
Yeah, this is it.
This is our bill.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.377
It's a Hamilton,
should be a Lincoln.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.837
- I don't think that's right.
- Yo, man.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.672
Lincoln's on the five.
This chick's crazy.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.798
- We just met, really.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.675
- So we're getting arrested?
- Depends.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.260
This car was here
night before last.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.762
I know that, so do you.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.180
Who was driving it?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.515
- Do you know the guy or not?

13:27.557 --> 13:30.310
* *

13:30.352 --> 13:32.020
- You, look at me.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.146
Give me a name right now.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.940
* *

13:35.982 --> 13:37.859
Aaron Marshall, 28.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.861
We have every reason to believe
this guy's our shooter.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.988
- He's got a sheet,
but it's all low level stuff.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.281
- These dealers,
they recognized Marshall.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.366
He's a regular.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.492
So when he pulls up in an SUV

13:45.533 --> 13:47.035
right before the shooting,

13:47.077 --> 13:48.620
they know it's not
his usual ride.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.622
They said he bought some dope,
and he was amped.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.374
- All right,
so scoop his ass up.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.375
- Thing is, Sergeant,
Kim and I already checked

13:53.416 --> 13:54.959
his LKA on the way back.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.711
- He cleared out the apartment,
moved out a few weeks ago,

13:56.753 --> 13:58.380
no forwarding.
- Landlord says he's like

13:58.421 --> 14:00.215
a couch-surfer type,
like he's a nomad.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.716
It just--it feels like
a brick wall.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.386
- I got Marshall's finsta,
just sent over the link.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.554
- Uh, I got a post
on January 2nd.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.807
You see this?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.308
- Maserati.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.060
- There can be only so many
Maseratis busted up

14:12.102 --> 14:13.228
around here in January.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.354
- There's exactly one.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.271
I'm sending you
the police report.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.399
2017 Maserati Levante

14:17.440 --> 14:19.693
towed to Wood Dale Salvage
on Green Street.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.069
- It's gotta be
where Marshall works.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.654
- Good, do it.
Move.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.822
- Yeah.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.245
- Hey.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.329
- Oh, sorry.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.455
- How long you been a cop?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.957
- Oh, God, since I was born.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.417
- How's that work?

14:35.458 --> 14:36.876
- Dad's a cop.
- OK.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.254
- You know any cop families?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.755
- I know one, yeah.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.715
Let's go.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.970
- Aaron's somewhere on
the east side of the yard.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.680
Is he in some kind of trouble?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.515
- How many ways
you got out of here, man?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.766
- Two.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.685
The back door is on the
south end on Carter,

14:53.727 --> 14:54.894
locked from the inside.
- All right.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.271
I'm gonna post up there.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.397
- How many workers
you got today?

14:57.439 --> 14:59.441
- Five.
Me, Aaron, three more.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.567
- We gotta get the others
out of here safely

15:00.608 --> 15:02.152
without making a lot of noise.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.862
- Yeah,
we're spread pretty thin.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.572
- All right.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.781
Walk out that way
through the front.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.158
Don't come back
until we tell you.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.617
Let's go.
- Be sure to get out.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.411
- Mm-hmm.

15:11.453 --> 15:12.954
- All right,
we fan out, we clear the place.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.497
If you find one of the workers,
you bring him out safe,

15:14.539 --> 15:15.707
come back, do it again.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.459
No radio traffic
until we find Marshall.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.128
- Copy that.
- Let's do it.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.089
[tense music]

15:23.131 --> 15:30.263
* *

15:34.684 --> 15:36.853
- OK going left?

15:36.895 --> 15:41.733
* *

15:41.775 --> 15:42.984
[metal clattering]

15:43.026 --> 15:49.949
* *

15:53.495 --> 15:55.497
- [quietly]
Hey. Hey, sir.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.207
You all good. Chicago PD.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.708
I just need you
to get out the yard, OK?

15:58.750 --> 15:59.918
There you go.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.252
Hurry up, hurry up.

16:01.294 --> 16:08.343
* *

16:12.889 --> 16:13.973
- I got eyes on Marshall.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.643
Northeast corner,
near Elizabeth Court.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.852
[clattering]

16:17.894 --> 16:19.229
Chicago PD, stop!

16:19.270 --> 16:21.022
He's running, headed north.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.108
[gunshots]

16:23.149 --> 16:25.443
- 10-1, 10-1, shots fired,
Wood Dale Salvage,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.612
800 block of Green.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.155
- I'm not hit,
but I lost eyes.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.865
- I got to be right
on top of him.

16:30.907 --> 16:37.872
* *

16:40.542 --> 16:41.960
Marshall, stop!

16:42.002 --> 16:44.921
[suspenseful music]

16:44.963 --> 16:51.928
* *

16:57.183 --> 16:58.226
Drop your weapon, Marshall!

16:58.268 --> 16:59.352
Get on the ground!

16:59.394 --> 17:01.104
- No, no, no, no, no way, no.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.522
- Marshall, get on the ground!

17:02.564 --> 17:03.481
Do not wave that weapon.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.608
- No, this is--

17:05.650 --> 17:06.901
- Marshall, focus on me.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.153
Marshall!

17:08.194 --> 17:09.487
Marshall, I will shoot you.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.613
Drop your weapon!

17:10.655 --> 17:13.074
- On your six.
- Yeah.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.576
Marshall--

17:14.617 --> 17:17.037
- [coughs]
- I need you to drop it, OK?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.289
- Thank God.

17:22.584 --> 17:26.046
- 1313 King, shots fired by
the police, offender down.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.965
Wood Dale Salvage,
we need an ambo on 20.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.134
- What was that?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.344
What was that?
- What was what?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.595
I just saved your life.
You're welcome.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.929
- Danny, I had him.
He was done.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.264
- Burgess,
the guy took shots at us.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.265
He refused to put his gun down.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.558
He was waving it at you.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.144
- Are you all right?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.520
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.105
Just make sure
the squads find us, OK?

17:44.147 --> 17:45.690
- All right.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.734
- Danny, do you know that guy?

17:47.776 --> 17:49.235
It felt like maybe
he knew you or--

17:49.277 --> 17:50.111
- The hell are you
talking about?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.112
No.

18:01.706 --> 18:01.873
.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.834
[vehicle beeping]

18:07.921 --> 18:09.255
- Hey.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.717
You gave your statement to IRT?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.053
OK, case is clear and closed.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.680
Let's crack off
the closing supps,

18:16.721 --> 18:19.057
make sure the paper's tight.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.353
- Something's not right.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.647
* *

18:25.689 --> 18:26.856
I had Marshall.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.234
Yes, he still had a gun
in his hand.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.527
He wasn't obeying my commands,

18:30.568 --> 18:31.861
but he wasn't gonna hurt me.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.238
You know that feeling, right?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.156
He was done.
- OK. And then?

18:35.198 --> 18:36.491
- And then--

18:36.533 --> 18:38.618
and then Alvarado shows up,

18:38.660 --> 18:41.663
and everything changes.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.499
Marshall's whole
body language changes.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.543
And Alvarado denied it,
but it felt--

18:46.584 --> 18:48.837
it felt like
they knew each other.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.588
If I didn't know any better,
I would say

18:50.630 --> 18:53.508
Alvarado was looking for
a reason to take Marshall out.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.677
Now, if Alvarado knew
the shooter at the 13th--

18:55.719 --> 18:57.053
- Kim, stop talking.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.596
- [exhales]

19:01.391 --> 19:03.893
- You understand

19:03.935 --> 19:07.022
you cannot be wrong about this?

19:11.276 --> 19:12.402
All right, dig in at 21,

19:12.444 --> 19:13.945
just you and Adam.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.071
- Yeah.

19:15.113 --> 19:22.037
* *

19:24.247 --> 19:26.082
- Well, what do you got?

19:26.124 --> 19:28.043
- Alvarado lied to me.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.919
He and Marshall,
they knew each other.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.130
At the very least,
they crossed paths.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.716
So two years ago,
Alvarado busted Marshall,

19:34.758 --> 19:37.927
some trap house on Edison.

19:37.969 --> 19:38.803
Here.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.430
Here's the 13th arrest book.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.765
Here's Alvarado.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.808
Here's Marshall,
6 grams of heroin,

19:43.850 --> 19:48.897
and then nothing, no record of
Marshall ever hitting lockup.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.940
- No 99 confidential?
- No, no, no.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.776
Marshall just walked out
the back door.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.277
- I looked into complaints
at the 13th.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.528
Alvarado, he's pretty clean.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.030
He did catch one beef
a few months back.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.531
- Good. Anything to it?
- There's no way of knowing.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.076
The complaint was retracted,
so the narrative was sealed.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.660
- Huh, so the only way
we're gonna see it

20:02.702 --> 20:04.662
is with a court order,
which takes a lot of time,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.164
makes a lot of noise.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.665
- All right, now all we got
is the complainant's name,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.000
Gabriela Baez.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.585
- Hm.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.630
- You know it?

20:13.672 --> 20:16.800
- Gabriela Baez.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.010
She's a Venezuelan,
a migrant at the 13th.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.971
Gabriela was friends with
our victim, Raquel Bolivar.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.432
- OK, so find out
why this Gabriela

20:24.474 --> 20:26.142
lodged a complaint
against Alvarado.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.769
Let's go.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.337
- Where is everybody?
What happened?

20:54.379 --> 20:55.463
- Bus pulled up last night,

20:55.505 --> 20:57.549
took a bunch of them
to shelters.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.217
- Where?
- Beats me.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.302
There's, like, 60 shelters now
for these people.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.764
All I know is, I'm damn happy
to have my lobby back.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.351
- I need to find
a Gabriela Baez.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.978
- Who?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.688
- Gabriela Baez.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.773
She lived here for,
like, two months.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.528
There's got to be some sort of
list, a manifest, something.

21:18.570 --> 21:19.529
- I tried telling you.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.822
This is chaos.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.907
Nobody knows anything.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.244
- Somebody's got to know
something.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.294
Look, I just need to know
if Gabriela was on that bus,

21:34.336 --> 21:35.420
where she was going.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.380
- I can't help you.

21:37.422 --> 21:41.426
- Did Gabriela and Raquel speak
to you before the shooting?

21:41.468 --> 21:43.053
Talk to me.
- No.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.138
I don't talk to cops
any more than I have to.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.348
If these people see me
talking to you,

21:46.389 --> 21:47.891
they're gonna think
that I'm one of you.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.225
They'll stop talking to me,

21:49.267 --> 21:52.020
and that's not good
for their health.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.230
- You got a albuterol in there?

21:54.272 --> 21:55.523
- Yeah, it's for asthma.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.983
Most of these kids have it
when they get here.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.902
- Abilify?
- It treats depression.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.236
- And those are both
schedule II narcotics.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.405
So on paper, you're a
drug dealer, not a medic.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.074
- I'm doing this for free.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.159
You're really gonna
do that to me, to them?

22:06.201 --> 22:07.702
- Try me.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.121
Was Gabriela Baez on that bus?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.918
- Yeah.
- OK.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.586
- She was the first one
on the bus.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.713
I tried to figure out where
it was going, and I couldn't,

22:18.755 --> 22:20.757
but Gabriela didn't care.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.092
It was gonna be
better than here.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.593
This place has been hell
for her and Raquel.

22:23.635 --> 22:26.262
- What does that mean?

22:26.304 --> 22:27.263
- [sighs]

22:27.305 --> 22:28.848
- Here's what I know.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.725
I know Gabriela filed a
complaint against the police

22:30.767 --> 22:32.769
but then retracted it.

22:32.811 --> 22:35.605
What am I missing?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.232
Please.

22:40.527 --> 22:43.363
- Raquel came to me for these.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.614
- OK, pain relievers.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.116
Why?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.785
- Because...

22:48.827 --> 22:51.413
I think she had been raped.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.747
- What?

22:52.789 --> 22:55.041
- And the wounds
that she told me that she had,

22:55.083 --> 22:56.918
the way that
she and Gabriela talked,

22:56.960 --> 22:58.586
I think she was raped.

22:58.628 --> 22:59.713
And I think Gabriela was there

22:59.754 --> 23:01.214
and saw the whole thing happen.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.008
And she insisted
it was consensual.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.927
But I told her,
you need real care,

23:05.969 --> 23:07.470
more than I can provide.

23:07.512 --> 23:09.305
- And Gabriela tried to report
it and then retracted it.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.099
- Yeah, they were scared.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.434
They don't have
any legal status.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.436
They have no power.
They have no rights.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.272
And...

23:17.313 --> 23:19.816
[sighs]
I suspect whoever raped Raquel

23:19.858 --> 23:23.737
was still at
the police station.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.238
- Because he works there.

23:25.280 --> 23:32.203
* *

23:33.872 --> 23:35.498
- Look, I was going
to get to her,

23:35.540 --> 23:37.542
but we're all jammed up.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.668
Not sure if you noticed,

23:38.710 --> 23:40.086
but this is a tough town
right now.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.921
We get a lot of clients.
- Not like this.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.007
- Exactly like this, Kim.

23:44.049 --> 23:48.178
No real mystery
why Raquel Bolivar died

23:48.219 --> 23:49.637
after being shot three times.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.514
- Oh, my God, just tell me
what you know, Petey.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.016
- [sighs]

23:53.058 --> 23:55.352
I can't confirm sexual assault.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.686
- OK.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.355
- There's some faint traces
of perineal tearing.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.983
But with two months healing,
it's not there.

24:02.025 --> 24:04.027
But she was pregnant.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.445
- Can you tell
who the father is?

24:05.487 --> 24:08.114
- No, I tried. Too early.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.367
If she'd lived maybe
one more week, we could do it.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.868
- Right.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.870
Stop. What is that?

24:13.912 --> 24:15.663
- Somebody put a tourniquet
on her.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.040
- I know somebody
put a tourniquet on her.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.875
It's--it's in the wrong place.
- Yeah.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.960
That tourniquet goes
above the wound,

24:21.002 --> 24:22.545
Raquel might have survived.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.464
We see it all the time;

24:24.506 --> 24:25.715
bystanders try to help out,

24:25.757 --> 24:26.800
only make things worse.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.760
- It wasn't a bystander.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.720
- What? Who was it?

24:30.762 --> 24:32.263
- It was a cop.

24:37.394 --> 24:37.811
.

24:37.852 --> 24:38.645
- This was always about Raquel.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.563
She wasn't a random victim.

24:40.605 --> 24:43.274
She was a target.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.443
Alvarado raped her.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.070
She got pregnant.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.405
That was a real problem
for him.

24:48.446 --> 24:51.116
So he hires Aaron Marshall
to kill her.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.992
And when it looks like
she'll survive the shooting,

24:53.034 --> 24:54.369
well,

24:54.411 --> 24:56.371
Alvarado made sure
that didn't happen.

24:56.413 --> 24:57.747
- Alvarado's an Army vet.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.833
He's got more field medicine
training than any of us.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.543
There's no way
he puts a tourniquet

25:01.584 --> 25:03.086
on the wrong side of a GSW.

25:03.128 --> 25:05.880
- Oh, sure.
Let's talk evidence, though.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.298
- Well, we got no eyewitness
to the rape.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.467
Don't know where it
happened, when, how.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.969
- We have no hard evidence
Alvarado and Raquel

25:11.011 --> 25:12.262
were in the same room.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.681
We have no hard evidence
they ever even met.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.813
- Find Gabriela Baez,
get her to talk.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.898
We don't--

25:23.940 --> 25:25.734
well, we don't,
Alvarado walks.

25:25.775 --> 25:29.696
[dramatic music]

25:29.738 --> 25:31.364

25:31.406 --> 25:33.324
En route to Belmont Cragin
right now.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.660
- No sign of Gabriela at the
shelter in Archer Heights.

Headed to West Beverly.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.856
- Fine.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.316
What are you doing here?

26:06.358 --> 26:08.943
- Oh, I'm just dropping off
some hot chocolate

26:08.985 --> 26:10.862
at the shelter.

26:10.904 --> 26:13.198
You know how important
those migrants are to me.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.913
Hey, so I understand,
your team pulled

26:19.954 --> 26:21.831
every beef logged
against every copper

26:21.873 --> 26:25.085
at the 13th
in the last six months.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.169
- Sure.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.879
You know,
just covering our bases.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.466
- I'm just--I'm curious
the strategy there.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.926
Like, what was that about?

26:32.967 --> 26:35.261
You had to know you were
ruffling some feathers on that.

26:37.013 --> 26:39.224
- You seem to think
that would bother me.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.267
- Honestly,
I'm just looking to learn.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.229
Honestly.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.691
- I'll see you around, Danny.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.901
- Hey, 'cause, Kim,

26:49.943 --> 26:52.529
you know
we found the bad guy, right?

26:52.570 --> 26:55.573
Justice was served.
The case is closed.

Gabriela, it's OK.

I need to talk to you
about Raquel

27:53.131 --> 27:55.300
and Danny Alvarado.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.676
Hey.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.136
Look at me.

Your English is really good.
Did you learn that in school?

- TikTok.

[speaks Spanish]

28:26.873 --> 28:30.043
- Um, when I was a kid,

28:30.085 --> 28:31.670
my parents
didn't really want us around

28:31.711 --> 28:33.213
too much on weekends.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.548
So they sent me and my sister
home with our nanny Silvia,

28:35.590 --> 28:37.425
and she was Colombian.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.346
- And do you still
speak with her?

28:41.388 --> 28:43.139
- Sometimes, yeah,
Christmas and stuff.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.349
She has this great family,

28:44.391 --> 28:46.351
super close,
all I ever wanted.

28:46.393 --> 28:49.020
Anyway, um,

28:49.062 --> 28:50.188
I wouldn't speak
a word of English

28:50.230 --> 28:52.941
till I got to school on Monday.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.363
Silvia was also undocumented,

28:58.405 --> 29:00.323
always looking
over her shoulder,

29:00.365 --> 29:03.451
afraid they'd come for her
and deport her.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.704
Gabriela, I have never
understood the idea

29:05.745 --> 29:07.163
of an illegal human being.

29:07.205 --> 29:10.125
[soft dramatic music]

[speaking Spanish]

29:31.271 --> 29:34.399
- [speaking Spanish]

29:45.952 --> 29:47.912
Papers.

29:47.954 --> 29:54.586
* *

29:54.627 --> 29:57.047
- Kim, there are 11,000
Venezuelans in Chicago

29:57.088 --> 30:00.133
right now, all stuck in limbo,
all seeking asylum,

30:00.175 --> 30:01.301
all trying
to get work permits.

30:01.343 --> 30:03.887
- OK.
- Every case is an emergency.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.889
Call me in three months.
- [sighs]

[indistinct chatter]

30:35.960 --> 30:37.212
- Vale. Vamos.

30:37.253 --> 30:44.386
* *

30:59.693 --> 31:01.319
- Stop.

31:03.238 --> 31:04.906
I'm not here as a cop.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.533
- How does that work?

31:08.868 --> 31:10.704
- I'm here as a customer, OK?

31:12.914 --> 31:15.166
I need a Social Security card,
and I need a work permit,

31:15.208 --> 31:17.252
and I need it to look good.

31:37.605 --> 31:40.567
* *

31:40.608 --> 31:42.527
- No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

31:42.569 --> 31:43.903
Hey, what is this? What is this?
- Step away, ma'am.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.071
- I'm CPD. That's my witness--
- I said step away.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.448
- My witness is on that bus.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.866
My witness is on that bus.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.242
- I don't care if she's
your witness or your sister.

31:49.284 --> 31:51.077
You got no jurisdiction here,
not anymore.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.746
- Can you tell me
what happened?

31:52.787 --> 31:54.539
- [sighs]
The shelter found narcotics

31:54.581 --> 31:56.082
on some of the illegals
in the church.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.585
City's got zero tolerance
in the shelters.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.754
[car door slams]
[engine turns over]

32:00.795 --> 32:02.714
- Where are you taking them?

32:02.756 --> 32:04.549
- Venezuela.

32:04.591 --> 32:11.514
* *

32:17.437 --> 32:17.604
.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.147
- There is no way that Gabriela
was using dope in that church.

32:20.482 --> 32:22.108
It was obviously planted
as a way to get rid of her.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.235
Alvarado's still
covering his tracks.

32:24.277 --> 32:26.071
- OK. You got proof?

32:28.907 --> 32:30.825
On paper, our only witness

32:30.867 --> 32:33.411
is an accused drug user
in federal custody

32:33.453 --> 32:35.372
on her way back to Venezuela.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.835
We have no confirmation
Raquel was sexually assaulted.

32:40.877 --> 32:43.296
- What about the tourniquet?
- "Fog of war."

32:43.338 --> 32:46.549
State's attorney could
never hinge a case on that.

32:46.591 --> 32:47.926
Look, Kim.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.970
I know you want it, so do I.

32:51.012 --> 32:55.433
But right now, everything
we have is circumstantial.

32:55.475 --> 32:56.893
And we just don't have it.

32:56.935 --> 33:01.898
* *

33:01.940 --> 33:05.276
- Wait, so you never actually
saw the drugs at your church?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.489
OK. So you didn't call ICE?
Who did?

33:09.531 --> 33:10.532
I know it's an anonymous tip.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.158
I'm not asking for the name.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.452
I need the number that was used
to call into the tip line.

33:14.494 --> 33:15.412
[sighs]

33:15.453 --> 33:18.123
No, I can't call back tomor--

[sighs]

33:24.963 --> 33:26.715
[sighs]

33:27.966 --> 33:30.635
- Hey,
brought you some coffee.

33:34.472 --> 33:36.558
You know, maybe it's time
to take a little break.

33:39.477 --> 33:42.063
- You had a buddy
that was detailed to ICE.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.273
- Yeah, Paulie Marino.
- Yes.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.150
- You want to call him?
- Yes.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.444
Yeah, of course--
we never talked.

33:47.485 --> 33:49.654
You're the best, Paulie.

33:51.823 --> 33:53.658
- All right.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.368
Here.

33:57.162 --> 34:00.040
All right.
I'll get the tower pings.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.916
- That one.
- Yeah.

34:06.338 --> 34:07.839
[keyboard clacking]

34:11.718 --> 34:13.511
- Oh, my God.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.516
- Alvarado's house
in Mount Greenwood.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.643
- Sent a copy to TACT?
- Already done.

34:20.685 --> 34:22.520
- All right,
tell me something good.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.397
- The tip that came into ICE
that the migrants

34:24.439 --> 34:26.649
were using dope at the church,
it came from a burner.

34:26.691 --> 34:28.651
That burner pinged
to the 13th District.

34:28.693 --> 34:29.861
- Alvarado thought
he was solving a problem

34:29.903 --> 34:31.112
by tipping off ICE.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.655
He actually managed to create
another problem.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.741
We traced that burner
back to a diner.

34:34.783 --> 34:36.034
- This is footage
from the diner.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.453
Here's two days before
the shooting on 13th.

34:38.495 --> 34:39.871
Here's Danny Alvarado.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.499
And there's his hit man,
Aaron Marshall.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.834
- We're on. Nice work.

34:44.876 --> 34:46.294
- Let's go.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.757
[clanking]

34:52.550 --> 34:54.803
- Your wife said
I could come back.

34:54.844 --> 34:56.221
She's lovely.

35:01.184 --> 35:02.686
You raped Raquel Bolivar.

35:04.062 --> 35:05.855
- [sighs]

35:05.897 --> 35:09.442
Jesus.
OK. Look.

35:09.484 --> 35:12.821
I had a relationship
with Raquel Bolivar, OK?

35:14.114 --> 35:15.240
Look, I liked her.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.700
It was nice, all right?

35:16.741 --> 35:18.910
But I couldn't tell anyone,
for obvious reasons.

35:20.078 --> 35:21.371
[sighs]

35:21.413 --> 35:23.331
She wanted to have a baby, OK?

35:23.373 --> 35:24.791
She wanted to have
an anchor baby.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.669
And look, honestly,

35:27.711 --> 35:30.380
she broke my heart
in the process.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.965
And then she died in my arms.

35:32.007 --> 35:33.591
- You raped Raquel Bolivar,

35:33.633 --> 35:35.593
and when she told you
she was gonna keep the baby,

35:35.635 --> 35:39.055
that wasn't gonna be her
decision either, was it?

35:39.097 --> 35:41.891
You think of these people as
different from you, separate.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.059
- Me?

35:43.101 --> 35:45.270
I--I do?

35:45.311 --> 35:48.440
Burgess, do you--you think I
haven't done my homework, too?

35:48.481 --> 35:50.817
I know who you are.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.236
White savior, you--you
found your Black daughter

35:53.278 --> 35:54.738
on the streets.

35:54.779 --> 35:57.907
You checked that box,
good for you.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.034
Now you're just over here

35:59.075 --> 36:01.578
looking for a new field
to plow, man.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.621
So this migrant thing
was just the best thing

36:03.663 --> 36:05.248
that could have happened
to you, right?

36:05.290 --> 36:06.291
Come on.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.209
- We know everything, Danny.

36:08.251 --> 36:09.753
Everything.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.463
- OK.

36:11.504 --> 36:12.839
What is it that you think
that you know?

36:12.881 --> 36:14.174
- Would you like to see
the footage

36:14.215 --> 36:17.594
of you and Aaron Marshall
at the diner on Dearborn?

36:17.635 --> 36:20.430
Stools at the counter,
black coffee--

36:20.472 --> 36:22.599
looked good.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.934
Or the footage of
Aaron Marshall 20 minutes later

36:24.976 --> 36:28.229
opening an envelope of cash
that you gave him,

36:28.271 --> 36:29.981
his payday
for murdering Raquel.

36:35.612 --> 36:37.864
- How many people
do you have outside?

36:37.906 --> 36:38.740
- Five.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.909
Got TACT in the alley, too.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.788
- [exhales]

36:44.829 --> 36:47.332
- You got two ways
to play it, Danny.

36:47.374 --> 36:49.501
You can confess, plead out.

36:49.542 --> 36:53.338
Maybe see your grandkids
one day before you're done.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.675
But if you make me work for it,

36:56.716 --> 37:00.387
that's solitary with
maybe one hour of yard a day

37:00.428 --> 37:02.138
till you die.

37:02.180 --> 37:03.973
- [sighs]

37:04.015 --> 37:06.434
Oh, man.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.229
Well,

37:09.270 --> 37:11.147
there is another way.

37:11.189 --> 37:13.650
* *

37:17.028 --> 37:19.447
- That for me?

37:19.489 --> 37:21.366
- It's for me.

37:24.035 --> 37:25.662
Look...

37:28.373 --> 37:31.501
Burgess,
give me five minutes alone.

37:31.543 --> 37:33.670
OK? Give me five minutes

37:33.712 --> 37:36.172
alone with my family.

37:36.214 --> 37:38.508
Let a man hug his wife
and his children goodbye,

37:38.550 --> 37:41.928
and I promise you...

37:41.970 --> 37:45.724
I'll save you
a bunch of headaches.

37:45.765 --> 37:47.308
OK?

37:50.353 --> 37:53.523
[loud clattering]

37:53.565 --> 37:57.027

take the easy way out?

37:57.068 --> 37:58.319
No.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.144

38:31.186 --> 38:32.645
- No, no.
I want to hear everything.

38:32.687 --> 38:34.647
Just let me put her to bed.

38:39.235 --> 38:41.738
All right, Bumblebee,
come over here.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.366
[sighs]
All right.

38:44.407 --> 38:46.493
So did you find Gabriela?

38:46.534 --> 38:48.620
- Yeah, I got her out
of federal custody.

38:48.661 --> 38:51.081
- All right.
- And she's gonna testify.

38:51.122 --> 38:53.333
I'm trying to get somebody
at the church to sponsor her

38:53.375 --> 38:55.669
so she'll have a place
to stay at least, you know?

38:55.710 --> 38:59.673
- [chuckles] Kim, you are
kind of a walking miracle.

38:59.714 --> 39:03.927
- Adam, I used my own money,
our money,

39:03.968 --> 39:06.930
to buy Gabriela
fake immigration papers today.

39:08.973 --> 39:10.266
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

39:10.308 --> 39:11.643
I just--
- Kim.

39:11.685 --> 39:12.936
- It was never gonna work.
I just--

39:12.977 --> 39:15.814
- Some cases,
you'll do whatever it takes.

39:18.316 --> 39:19.943
- But these women--

39:19.984 --> 39:22.987
Adam, these women--
Gabriela, Raquel, it's just--

39:24.572 --> 39:25.990
They're just fighting
for the same thing

39:26.032 --> 39:28.410
that everybody is fighting for,
you know, a home,

39:28.451 --> 39:30.453
a family.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.038
What we have now.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.790
- Sure.

39:33.832 --> 39:36.251
- And I know that
we fought like hell for it.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.378
- Oh, we bled for it, Kim.
- No, I know, I know, I know,

39:38.420 --> 39:41.715
but it's still--it's just--

39:41.756 --> 39:44.009
it doesn't seem fair.

39:46.177 --> 39:48.054
- No, I suppose not.

39:50.306 --> 39:53.768
- Promise me
we'll keep fighting for this

39:53.810 --> 39:55.061
because I need us, Adam.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.230
I need this family.

40:10.827 --> 40:13.079
Yeah, yeah,
I'll keep fighting for it

40:13.121 --> 40:15.999
for the rest of my life.

- That's nice.

a whole thing here,

40:24.507 --> 40:27.093
this seems better.
