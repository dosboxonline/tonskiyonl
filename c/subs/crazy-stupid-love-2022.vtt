And it's easy to just look
at a 13-year-old and say:

You are wrong."

After, my dad started teasing me
about my first date, the way dads do.

1:46:13.617 --> 1:46:16.452
And I told him, "Dad, it's no big deal.

1:46:16.620 --> 1:46:21.999
I'm gonna be going out with a lot of
different girls on a lot of different dates."

1:46:22.167 --> 1:46:25.669
And that is the first time
that I ever lied to my father.

...and I have loved her
every minute of every day...

1:46:37.265 --> 1:46:41.102
...since I first bought her
that mint chocolate chip cone.

1:46:42.771 --> 1:46:47.525
I have loved her through the birth
of my three perfect children.

1:46:48.652 --> 1:46:50.986
I have loved her
even when I've hated her.
