WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:17.017
Johnny!

00:19.185 --> 00:20.228
Johnny, come on!

00:24.315 --> 00:25.316
Ready to go?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.029
Just gotta say one more goodbye.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.532
- The car's already here.
- Don't worry. I know where she is.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.557
Stop!

01:05.231 --> 01:06.066
Come here.

01:08.777 --> 01:12.530
I told you. You cannot be here.
This is for students only!

01:14.866 --> 01:16.159
What was that?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.286
That's enough!

01:22.665 --> 01:25.126
Respectfully, Master Kim,
you should be training her,

01:25.627 --> 01:27.754
not punishing her for wanting to learn.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.174
You are sensei here?

01:32.050 --> 01:32.884
No?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.054
You go back to America

01:37.263 --> 01:38.515
and be sensei.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.809
Here, you are student.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.561
Not very good student

01:44.145 --> 01:45.814
if you ask for mercy.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.398
I know the lesson.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.277
And when the circumstances called for it,
I didn't show mercy.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.530
Circumstance?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.328
Lesson for whole life.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.457
I will teach you again.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.167
And this time,

02:06.251 --> 02:11.131
you will never forget.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.050
What do you mean?

02:23.518 --> 02:24.769
She should be learning.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.983
She is learning right now.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.196
So you'll teach her then?

02:43.079 --> 02:44.414
My granddaughter.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.332
My lesson.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.298
Hi-yah!

03:03.600 --> 03:05.518
You attack
your own grandfather?

03:06.853 --> 03:07.812
Are you afraid?

03:11.858 --> 03:12.692
Oh yeah?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.320
Then you're finally ready.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.323
You will stop hiding
and begin training tomorrow.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.437
"Not all of us have to
learn how to walk twice in one lifetime."

03:49.520 --> 03:53.483
"But we do all have to learn how
to pick ourselves back up when we're down

03:53.566 --> 03:55.193
and stand firmly on our own two feet."

03:55.276 --> 03:58.780
"In the end, I learned that first steps
are harder the second time around."

03:58.863 --> 04:01.699
"I hope my next step
brings me to Stanford University."

04:03.660 --> 04:05.245
I'm so proud.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.871
I'm gonna cry!

04:06.955 --> 04:08.539
This is brilliant.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.709
It's the greatest story
since <i>Don Juan DeMarco.</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:14.545
Oh, now I'm crying too.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.423
Go more for the jugular
at the end.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.509
- They'll be begging you to go there.
Okay.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.844
What do you think?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.179
It's great.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.515
Even though I'm kind of the bad guy in it.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.350
Uh, I… I'll change your name. I--

04:27.433 --> 04:28.977
No, dude. I'm… I'm kidding.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.480
It's not like I'm applying to Stanford.
Or anywhere, really.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.233
Come on, Robby. You have great futures
ahead of you, both of you.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.987
When we win the Sekai Taikai,
doors will be flying open for all of us.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.325
I… Hey, it's okay.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.286
Hey, hey, easy with the waterworks.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.047
- Rob, the bowls!
- It's a sewage pipe.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.133
Oh, it smells like shit.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.432
Yeah, well, it's unlivable.
When are you gonna fix it?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.767
That's bullshit, Sully.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.983
- He said he's working on it.
We have to look at the big picture.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.527
We're a family of five, almost six.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.904
And now we're down to two bedrooms.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.158
And Miguel wants to go to a college
we don't have the money for.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.286
- How are we going to make this work?
It's like I've been saying.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.288
The tournament will fix this.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.790
All right? It's gonna bring in
students and sponsorships.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.669
The tournament is still months away.
What do we do in the meantime?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.547
I hear you.
I'm gonna take care of it.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.260
I still have
some really good memories here.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.600
Even when your grandfather's idea
of training was more like torture.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.688
But he was true to his word though.
He began training me the day you left.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.358
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
back in the Valley.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.694
- But Silver just--
Silver is gone now.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.739
I did come to America hoping to see you,

06:04.822 --> 06:06.783
but I was blinded by the promise

06:06.866 --> 06:09.118
of bringing Grandfather's karate
to the world.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.412
That promise can still be kept.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.209
With Cobra Kai,
you earned a spot in the Sekai Taikai.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.505
I say we go win it.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.801
I would say yes, but…

06:26.886 --> 06:28.221
it is not up to me.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.527
Master Kim.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.283


06:49.367 --> 06:53.538
<i>Seniors are invited to the student</i>
<i>center for a lunchtime college fair.</i>

06:53.621 --> 06:55.998
<i>Representatives from four-year colleges…</i>

06:56.499 --> 06:59.752
- Hey.
- Hey. Whoa, you got a lot of brochures.

06:59.836 --> 07:03.506
Yeah, okay, but don't be worried.
At least three are close to Stanford.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.842
Oh, come on.
I haven't even gotten in. Please.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.343
- Hey!
- What's up?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.972
All of our trials and tribulations
of nerdom have finally come to this.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.391
- We're the belles of the ball.
- Is that what we are?

07:13.474 --> 07:14.809
Oh, yes, my friend.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.352
They are fumbling around our dresses

07:16.436 --> 07:18.354
trying to cop a feel
of our tantalizing brains.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.898
- Okay, that's where I leave you.
- I'm sorry.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.775
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.653
These vultures are
wasting their time though.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.781
Eli and I have had our sights set
on MIT for years.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.034
Are you applying early decision
to Stanford?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.035
Yeah, definitely.

07:33.119 --> 07:37.540
But I should look into some safety schools
too. Stanford's pretty expensive.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.499
Hey, fam.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.295
You bros looking to post up
at a college a little closer to home,

07:42.378 --> 07:43.838
or what's the word?

07:44.464 --> 07:50.052
Well, Gary, the word is
we'll be taking our brodeo on the roadeo.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.848
But, um, thank you
for all of your bro-vertures.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.351
All right, bet.
But safety schools get a bad rap.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.229
They keep you closer to home,
set you up for a big school later,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.899
and they take that weight
off Mom and Pop's wallet.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.278
Thanks.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.994
Is this a Johnny Lawrence pop-in?

08:15.077 --> 08:18.122
What the hell is a pop-in?
I came to borrow your blow-up mattress.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.207
All right, come in.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.542
We're having an issue with the pipes.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.253
- Carmen's place is flooded.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Johnny.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.672
We're all staying at my house
until it's fixed.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.008
Unless I can find us
someplace better to rent.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.635
Ah, sellers' market.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.261
Not a good time to rent.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.932
I don't need advice from a guy
who's just here on a karate vacation.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.808
How do you know what kind of market it is?

08:37.892 --> 08:40.520
<i>Selling Sunset, Property Brothers,</i>

08:40.603 --> 08:41.938
all my shows.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.315
Maybe take Chozen with you.
Use his expertise.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.525
Yeah, and who knows,

08:45.608 --> 08:49.028
maybe you'll find yourself
a short-term rental, you know?

08:49.695 --> 08:50.530
All right.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.366
You guys throw that air mattress
in the van.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.285
I'm gonna grab one of those
special PB&Js for the road.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.412
- You need anything?
- Diet Dr. Pepper.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.666
Nothing for me. Thanks.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.213
Master Kim.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.800
I'm glad to see
the way of the fist is alive and well.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.385
Just like you.

09:12.885 --> 09:17.431
But the time has come to spread
your teachings to the rest of the world.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.975
With your blessing,

09:20.351 --> 09:23.396
we will take the place
that your granddaughter has earned

09:23.479 --> 09:25.106
in the Sekai Taikai

09:26.023 --> 09:27.108
for Cobra Kai.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.246
No.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.499
Master Kim, maybe you did not understand.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.045
I understand.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.215
My granddaughter went to America.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.885
She made promises.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.179
She failed.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.472
Grandfather.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.016
- It was Silver--
- Excuses!

10:01.058 --> 10:04.312
This is why you will never be master.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.522
Your incompetence is why
I must stay alive.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.942
Success is in our reach.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.154
We will not get another chance.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.781
Fools

10:17.325 --> 10:20.244
always focus on prize.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.539
Never see enemies standing in way.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.500
No one will stand in our way.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.676
Never good student.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.888
Never good sensei.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.681
Such a disappointing sensei.

10:41.932 --> 10:46.187
Did Kim tell you how one of my students
disposed of five of yours?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.904
Ah.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.822
He still has some fight.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.574
Yeah.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.868
I give you chance.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.579
Prove self.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.503
Here, you'll see
our multi-level library,

11:10.586 --> 11:12.338
the fourth largest
in the San Fernando Valley.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.589
What are we doing here?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.634
If the University of Phoenix
wasn't online, it'd be this.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.804
Chillax, okay?
I still need to keep my options open.

11:19.887 --> 11:20.971
Yo, bro, go long!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.766
- The chemistry lab was rebuilt in 1993--
- Got it.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.813
Oh, sick grab, boy!

11:28.896 --> 11:30.064
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

11:30.147 --> 11:31.732
You just got Brucksed!

11:31.816 --> 11:33.234
You're welcome, homey.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.780
- Oh. What's up, guys?
- Kyler, you go to school here?

11:37.863 --> 11:41.659
Nah, it's more like this school
goes to me. You know what I mean?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.994
What's up, Brucks?
You… you look good, man.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.705
Thanks, man. All new teeth.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.332
Swallowed the old ones when you--

11:51.919 --> 11:56.006
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that, dude.
I… I was in a bad place then, and--

11:56.090 --> 11:57.258
It's all good, buddy.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.094
Play karate games,
win karate prizes, you know?

12:01.178 --> 12:02.972
Hey, it helped me get my life on track.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.516
<i>Ad meliora. </i>"Toward better things."

12:05.599 --> 12:06.767
Sick.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.603
- See you at the house?
- Bet.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.272
Yes, sir. Let's go!

12:11.355 --> 12:14.859
Wait, so you and Brucks both go here.
That makes sense.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.153
No, he's just visiting. He goes to MIT.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.280
I'm sorry. Did you say MIT?

12:19.363 --> 12:21.157
Yeah, and he's killing it too.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.286
So what's up, guys?

12:26.287 --> 12:27.621
We hanging out or what?

12:31.333 --> 12:34.462
Shit, this place is perfect.
It's got stairs and everything.

12:34.545 --> 12:38.466
Do not fall in love with first house.
We still have others to see.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.386
Ah, there's agent.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.305
Typical LA asshole.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.723
Big watch.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.475
Dumb haircut.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.226
All lies.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.353
Gentlemen.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.190
- Follow my lead.
- What do we think?

12:54.273 --> 12:55.733
Prime spot, right?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.694
- I'm Baz. And you are?
- Oh, Chozen Toguchi.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.154
So nice to meet you.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.074
Uh, it is my honor
to introduce to you Mr. John Lawrence.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.535
Toguchi? I… I don't know you.
Who are you with?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.496
Uh, independent realtor.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.164
Very select clientele only.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.625
Mr. Lawrence. It's a pleasure.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.127
Uh, can I ask what you do?

13:15.211 --> 13:18.255
Oh, he is partner
in emerging Valley business.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.424
Well, that sounds promising.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.634
So, what do we think?

13:21.717 --> 13:23.886
Four bedrooms. 2,100 square feet.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.096
- Upgraded appliance--
- I'll stop you there.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.432
I'm ready to take this off your hands.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.311
Uh, well, I… I appreciate that,
but it's a pretty competitive situation.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.688
- Is that your car?
- Oh, hell yeah.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.484
Gonna have that parked here day and night.
Let everyone know who's the new king.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.402
Okay, so it would… it would just be you?

13:40.486 --> 13:42.988
Oh, hell no. If it was just me,
I'd be sleeping in the car.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.074
Uh, no. There's my girl.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.951
Haven't made an honest woman of her yet,

13:47.034 --> 13:49.829
but as soon as I can afford a ring,
bam, you know what I'm saying?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
She's knocked up, so baby makes three.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.874
Then there's our boys. And then Rosa.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.336
She's a sweet Ecuadorian lady.
Likes to smoke weed all day. You're gon--

13:57.419 --> 14:00.881
We are prepared to offer $200 over asking.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.716
- Like hell we are.
- I'm sorry.

14:02.800 --> 14:07.221
But my client is looking for a tenant
who's a little bit more stable.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.430
Who are you calling unstable?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.641
I'll knock that dumb haircut
right off your stupid face.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.560
- Show you how unstable I am.
- Johnny.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.646
What? You're the one who said
he had a dumb haircut. I'm just agreeing.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.908
This land was once
under Japanese colonial rule.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.036
<i>When I was just a boy,</i>

14:31.120 --> 14:34.456
<i>invaders try</i>
<i>to conscript me into military,</i>

14:34.540 --> 14:38.586
<i>so I flee into forest</i>
<i>and take shelter in cave.</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:41.171
<i>But invaders find me.</i>

14:41.755 --> 14:44.884
<i>So I fight them</i>
<i>using my father's </i>eunjangdo,

14:45.634 --> 14:47.428
<i>ancient family knife.</i>

14:48.095 --> 14:52.683
<i>I kill a dozen men</i>
<i>before I lose </i>eunjangdo.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.686
<i>You want to prove self,</i>

14:56.437 --> 14:58.147
<i>return knife to me.</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:00.107
<i>But be warned.</i>

15:00.941 --> 15:06.614
<i>In that darkness,</i>
<i>you will find more than just </i>eunjangdo.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.509
<i>Eunjangdo.</i>

15:37.436 --> 15:38.854
Hello, gorgeous.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.608
I'm gonna take that knife,

15:43.484 --> 15:45.110
whether you like it or not.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.184
Whoo! I love college!

16:17.267 --> 16:19.144
Woo-hoo!

16:19.228 --> 16:21.230
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

16:21.313 --> 16:23.273
Bro, you wanna see a party trick?

16:23.816 --> 16:28.070
I can't believe Brucks got into MIT.
And was he speaking Latin earlier?

16:28.153 --> 16:31.532
I don't know. Maybe your fists
unlocked his dormant brain.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.451
Hey, you… you gotta really
come over to my place, man.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.120
I got this, like, snake with…

16:36.203 --> 16:38.789
Even after everything,
Kyler still lands on his feet.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.958
Hey, Shitbreath!

16:44.753 --> 16:46.964
Did I tell you you could drink my beer,
bitch boy?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.298
N-No, sir, Mr. Zenker.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.426
Oh. Ugh.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.219
That shit is stale.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.972
Go make me some jungle juice.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.306
Yes, sir, Mr. Zenker.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.314
Whoo!

17:05.107 --> 17:06.942
Got that happy juice.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.363
- You gonna let him talk to you like that?
- Nah. What?

17:11.447 --> 17:14.241
That's just how they talk around here,
bro. You know, we good.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.327
But once I get done pledging,
I'm gonna run this shit.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.372
- Okay.
- Tell… Hey… Yo, hold up. Hold up.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.877
Taste this, bro.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.378
"Trash juice."

17:26.462 --> 17:27.796
Okay, thanks. Yeah.

17:31.091 --> 17:34.094
My boy! That's what I'm talking about!
That's how you know it's ready.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.557
Spikes! Spikes! Spikes! Spikes!
Spikes! Spikes! Spikes! Spikes! Spikes!

17:38.640 --> 17:41.351
Yeah, chug that shit, Spikes!

17:41.435 --> 17:43.812
Spikes! Spikes! Spikes! Spikes!

17:43.896 --> 17:46.315
Yeah!

17:46.398 --> 17:49.193
♪ <i>I'm gonna get you closer to the… </i>♪

17:49.276 --> 17:51.945
I am seriously considering a new haircut.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.364
Hey, what's up, bro?

17:54.448 --> 17:57.034
- Where's Shitbreath with the jungle juice?
- I don't know.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.953
If he wasn't doing all the bitchwork,
I'd say we just ditch his ass.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.997
We're definitely ditching him
once pledging's over.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.875
He gets into this frat over my dead body.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.836
Yeah! I like it.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.716
Are you blaming me for that clown douche's
attitude back there?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.176
No, not blaming you.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.429
But what happened to embracing Miyagi-Do?

18:17.513 --> 18:19.181
I have embraced Miyagi-Do.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.268
I'm doing all sorts of breathing exercises
and karate yoga bullshit at the dojo.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.395
Miyagi-Do not just for dojo.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.190
Miyagi-Do is a way of life.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.733
Sacred.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.611
Miyagi-Do come from here. Never here.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.404
Understand?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.784
I probably shouldn't have insulted
that guy's haircut.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.286
Was stupid haircut.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.288
Come. Second chance.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.630
Oh man, this place is even better.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.509
Oh crap.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.846
Twice in one day.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.722
Look, man, I was out of line.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.433
Yeah. Yeah, that you were.
There's the door.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.396
- There are other houses.
- Not in South Reseda.

19:07.479 --> 19:12.234
Look, you wanna be a stone's throw away
from Encino without paying Encino prices,

19:12.317 --> 19:13.443
I'm the guy you go through.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.321
And if you think
I'm gonna rent a house to a degenerate

19:16.405 --> 19:19.741
with a weird car and a sketchy family,
I got news for you.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.910
It ain't happening, chief.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.540
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
you can excuse yourselves.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.000
Hey, sorry about that, man.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.885
Hey, guys.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.803
I hope Baz didn't scare you off.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.014
Are you John Lawrence?

19:42.514 --> 19:46.435
Yeah. I haven't kicked your ass before,
have I? 'Cause you got that look.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.772
No. No. I saw you fight
in the All Valley in '83.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.108
I was in middle school.
You probably wouldn't remember me.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.945
Unless you do. Little Stevie.
Jerry's brother's friend.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.031
I used to moonwalk to class.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.033
You were awesome. You had insane skills.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.160
- You catch '84?
- No, I missed that one.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.997
Remember Dutch?
Dutch was so fricking cool.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.666
- Yeah, yeah, he's in prison.
- So cool, dude.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.960
Well, it's a great place
to turn your life around.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.047
So what's an All Valley champ
fricking prom king

20:15.130 --> 20:16.632
doing at Little Stevie's house?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.675
- I am his--
- It's all right. I got this.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.930
Listen, man. I got off on the wrong foot
with your agent.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.975
I'm just a guy looking
to make a better life for his family.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.561
Teenage boys,
pregnant girlfriend, her mom.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.313
I know I may not be the ideal tenant,

20:31.396 --> 20:35.192
but, uh, you know, I can really see
a place like this becoming my home.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.778
You'd wanna rent my house for real?

20:38.612 --> 20:39.738
I… I'd be honored.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.533
How's your credit?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.536
Can't imagine it's any good.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.205
Wealthy relative who died?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.415
- Unfortunately, he's still alive.
- That's a bummer.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.669
Listen, a place like this
is in anybody's reach

20:53.752 --> 20:56.129
with a steady income
and a solid deposit, stuff like that.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.173
I actually own
a couple of houses around here,

20:58.257 --> 21:01.551
so if you get your financials on track,
I'm sure we can work something out.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.761
Yeah?

21:04.304 --> 21:05.222
Hell yeah.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.517
- All right.
- Hell yeah, John Lawrence.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.143
John Lawrence.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.104
John Lawrence!

21:12.187 --> 21:13.272
See?

21:14.064 --> 21:15.148
Good karma.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.253
What is happening to me?

21:38.255 --> 21:39.840
You're all messed up, Johnny.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.844
But you did this to yourself.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.891
You did this to me.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.353
All I ever did was be your friend.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.440
No.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.360
You're the true enemy standing in my way.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.530
You seem to have forgotten.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.533
You're my weakness,

22:07.993 --> 22:09.328
but I'm not yours.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.877
You should be rotting in a cell.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.087
Sorry to disappoint you.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.215
Is that what you think I am? Disappointed?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.718
I think you're misguided.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.595
Now, whose fault is that?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.724
You must really hate me.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.604
Do you even understand
how much that hurts me?

22:36.605 --> 22:37.689
I don't care.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.649
You are the only person

22:40.150 --> 22:41.777
to make me feel this

22:43.195 --> 22:44.029
pain.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.532
And I never feel fear

22:49.284 --> 22:51.036
except when I fear for you.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.248
And I never show mercy.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.461
Except… to you.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.672
But never again.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.552
<i>So you finally understand.</i>

23:07.636 --> 23:11.139
<i>Yes. You are my weakness.</i>

23:24.277 --> 23:27.739
<i>You compromised your teachings.</i>
<i>The teachings of your master.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:30.450
<i>For me. </i>

23:33.578 --> 23:35.414
<i>I thought you were the answer.</i>

23:35.914 --> 23:36.998
<i>My reason.</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:48.093
<i>But all you really are</i>
<i>is just the enemy…</i>

23:50.554 --> 23:52.055
<i>standing in my way.</i>

24:11.408 --> 24:13.493
Uh, excuse me, Brucks.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.370
Hey.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.623
Uh, so we hear that you go to MIT?

24:18.707 --> 24:19.541
Oh yeah.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.960
What did you get on your SATs?

24:22.043 --> 24:23.336
Some ketchup.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.213
Just kidding!

24:25.297 --> 24:27.924
I don't know. I mean, like, 790, 780.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.302
Oh shit!

24:30.385 --> 24:31.595
Freshie!

24:31.678 --> 24:34.681
- Let's go. Load it up.
- 1570 SATs?

24:34.764 --> 24:37.058
- Load it up.
- I have no words.

24:37.809 --> 24:42.731
I don't know nothing about Stanford, Rhea,
but this place is lit!

24:42.814 --> 24:45.525
When you get here next year,
I'm gonna have it on lockdown.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.195
- You sure you're getting into this frat?
- "Sure?"

24:48.278 --> 24:50.780
Bro, does the Pope shit with a funny hat?

24:50.864 --> 24:52.532
Kyler, I gotta tell you something.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.117
Where's my vacuum?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.327
Oh shit.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.038
Yo, vacuum. Clean this up.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.583
- Nah, man, I'm good.
- Hey!

25:04.419 --> 25:05.545
Listen, Shitbreath.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.214
You want in,

25:07.297 --> 25:10.175
get on the ground and be the vacuum.

25:11.384 --> 25:12.385
Is he getting in?

25:12.469 --> 25:13.762
How about you stay out of this?

25:19.059 --> 25:21.228
Suction mode, on.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.111
Oh my God!

25:32.239 --> 25:33.406
Enough!

25:37.077 --> 25:38.578
Why don't you tell him the truth?

25:39.579 --> 25:40.872
The truth about what, man?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.208
Well, we had a good run.

25:44.167 --> 25:49.381
The truth is that you are never,
and I mean never, getting into this frat.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.221
Your loss.

It's time to talk turkey, LaRusso. I know
I just became an official Miyagi-Do sensei

28:19.114 --> 28:20.198
but I'm owed some back pay.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.826
And not entry-level. I want Chozen's rate.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.911
Huh. Deal.

28:24.994 --> 28:28.415
Okay, great. Should I see
your girl out front to cut me a check?

28:28.498 --> 28:30.834
Johnny, Chozen doesn't get paid.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.751
What?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.087
So you're just using free immigrant labor?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.840
That's a scumbag move,
even for a car dealer.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.759
Nobody gets paid.
That's the whole spirit of Miyagi-Do.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.261
No salaries. No dues.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.596
I'm not saying
it's gonna be like that forever.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.433
- I mean, if we win the Sekai Taikai--
- That's not soon enough.

28:47.642 --> 28:51.104
I gotta show ongoing income if I wanna
get my family into a killer house.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.858
Something like that takes time, man.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.696
All right. I'm trying here, man.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.031
I'm working the Miyagi-Do program.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.409
I didn't kick that guy's ass today.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.579
I thought that was
supposed to change things.

29:07.662 --> 29:11.124
I'm glad you didn't beat anybody up.
That's a positive step.

29:11.207 --> 29:14.252
- Asshole totally deserved it.
- Yeah, I'm… I'm sure he did.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.297
Look, Johnny,
Miyagi-Do is not a quick fix.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.426
It's a way of life. I know. I used to say
the same crap about Cobra Kai.

29:21.509 --> 29:22.552
It's not crap.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.305
It actually can help you
become a more centered person.

29:25.805 --> 29:28.349
But that doesn't mean
your problems are gonna go away overnight.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.067
What am I supposed to do, man?

29:38.651 --> 29:39.861
Do what I do.

29:39.944 --> 29:43.948
Maybe it's time you ditch the gig work,
you know, and get a real 9 to 5.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.206
Come on out, you son of a bitch.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.420
Oh.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.130
Round two.

30:01.758 --> 30:02.592
Yeah.

30:08.556 --> 30:11.184
This time, you're not gonna get me

30:11.267 --> 30:13.311
'cause I got my eyes…

30:16.189 --> 30:17.857
on the real prize.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.324
Ais!

30:31.496 --> 30:32.997
Oh. Oh, are you gonna… Oh. Oh!

30:33.081 --> 30:34.332
Oh. Damn!

30:35.083 --> 30:37.085
Man, why are the ghosts so fast?

30:37.585 --> 30:38.628
All right, enough.

30:38.711 --> 30:41.297
You gotta tell us
what is going on with MIT.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.425
I mean, did you cheat on the SATs or what?

30:44.509 --> 30:45.969
Fine. I lied.

30:46.052 --> 30:49.305
I didn't get a 790. I got a 750.

30:49.389 --> 30:53.852
I just wanted to impress you guys
'cause you're smart and stuff.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.854
Five hundred of it was in English though.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.064
Wait. You got 750 total?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.024
Yeah.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.945
What? Why are you guys
so worried about this anyway?

31:04.028 --> 31:06.155
Because we want to go to MIT.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.783
You wanna learn to fix washing machines?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.076
It's not that hard.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.543
"Midwest Industrial Training."

31:18.626 --> 31:22.005
<i>"Ad meliora." </i>Great, man.
That's… That… That's incredible.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.464
I'm stoked.

31:23.548 --> 31:27.051
So, uh, you guys want me
to make a call or something?

31:29.387 --> 31:33.266
Yeah, my dad, he was super pissed
when I didn't get into any schools.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.477
I agree. I slacked off.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.521
I'm a freaking idiot, man.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.648
You know, I had goals.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.526
I had dreams.
I just didn't stick with them.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.863
You know what I mean?

31:46.946 --> 31:47.780
Yeah.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.741
Actually, I… I… I do.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.620
Like, I could have gone
to a great party school,

31:53.703 --> 31:55.246
not a safety party school.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.293
The safety is always gonna be there, bro.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.755
You gotta chase after that damn dream.

32:04.672 --> 32:05.590
Yeah, that's…

32:06.674 --> 32:09.010
that's actually
some great advice, Kyler. Yeah.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.221
You think West Valley High
will let me back in?

32:12.889 --> 32:13.890
Why would you…

32:13.973 --> 32:16.935
Hey, are you the guys that got into
the fight at the Theta Omega house?

32:17.018 --> 32:18.102
Um…

32:18.603 --> 32:21.814
Hey, those guys are assholes.
They deserve it.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.108
Did someone really knock out Zenker?

32:24.609 --> 32:28.071
Yeah, man. Uh, say less, man.
That was me.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.239
Dude. Legend!

32:30.323 --> 32:33.952
Listen, man. If… if you're looking
for another house, you're in.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.036
No hazing.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.414
Just, uh, as long as you can be
that badass all the time.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.086
Yeah? I used to kick this guy's ass
all over the Valley.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.588
- Tell them, Rhea.
- It's… it's true.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.549
- You should come by tomorrow.
- All right.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.467
Hey.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.568
- Excuse me one sec.
- Okay.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.321
Hey, Johnny. What's going on?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.532
I've been thinking
about your offer to work here.

33:13.658 --> 33:17.120
- I decided let's give it a whirl.
- I… I… I… didn't exactly say--

33:17.203 --> 33:20.039
I'm all for playing the slow game.
I fixed the leak at the apartment.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.750
Even though I didn't get that house,
it got rented to someone else,

33:22.834 --> 33:24.669
I'm gonna be ready
to pounce on the next one.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.130
Where do I park my briefcase?

33:27.213 --> 33:29.340
Uh, j-just excuse me. One… one second.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.846
We can give him Robby's old job
filling the popcorn machine.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.306
He thinks I offered him my job.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.891
What do you think's in the briefcase?

33:38.975 --> 33:41.561
My money's on a bologna sandwich
and a pile of junk mail.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.312
Not helpful. Okay?

33:43.396 --> 33:46.524
He's finally embracing Miyagi-Do.
I gotta come up with something.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.401
Ooh!

33:48.985 --> 33:50.028
Someone sold a car.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.866
Congratulations.
You're gonna look so hot in this.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.576
Oh. Thank you.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.161
Hi. I'm Daniel LaRusso.

33:58.244 --> 34:01.414
Oh, I know who you are.

34:01.497 --> 34:06.210
May I just say that your salesperson,
John, is a real treasure.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.212
He made me feel so comfortable.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.883
You know, so many salespeople
just come at you so strong.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.593
Sometimes you have to be aggressive,

34:13.676 --> 34:16.345
but it's important
to listen to the customer.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.222
It's all about balance.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.642
Well, I'm gonna send my whole family here.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.938
Well, John here would be happy
to help all of them.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.401
Welcome to the LaRusso family.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.694
Thanks, man.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.363
What are you waiting for?
Get the lady her bonsai.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.284
You don't--

34:42.789 --> 34:46.709
You sent him to die.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.337
I sent him to face death.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.255
There is a difference.

35:12.985 --> 35:13.986
Mm.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.572
The prize.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.950
It's not about the prize.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.580
It's about eliminating
what stands in the way.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.923
So now you understand.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.554
Then, finally, we are ready.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.937
And nothing will ever
stand in our way again.
