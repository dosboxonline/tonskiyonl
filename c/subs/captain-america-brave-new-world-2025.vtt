WEBVTT

00:52.680 --> 00:54.660
Sir, one minute warning.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.500
Congratulations again.

00:56.530 --> 00:58.660
Heard anything from Betty,
from my daughter?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.670
No, sir.
We tried her several times.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.460
Okay.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.570
Thank you.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.490
All right, New Hampshire,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.530
we are moments away.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.660
Are you ready?

01:11.680 --> 01:14.610
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

01:14.630 --> 01:17.640
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

01:17.660 --> 01:20.680
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

01:21.450 --> 01:22.630
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22.650 --> 01:26.660
the next President of
the United States of America,

01:26.680 --> 01:29.490
Thaddeus Ross!

01:49.570 --> 01:50.630
Thank you.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.550
Tonight, America has spoken

01:56.570 --> 02:01.550
in one of the most important
elections of our lifetimes.

02:01.570 --> 02:05.480
We've recognized the urgency
of this moment.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.650
From the disappearance
of half of mankind

02:09.670 --> 02:12.640
to the emergence
of a celestial mass

02:12.660 --> 02:14.640
in the Indian Ocean,

02:14.660 --> 02:18.660
the threats we face show
no signs of slowing down.

02:18.680 --> 02:24.680
But the only way we can
overcome them is together!

02:26.440 --> 02:27.470
Tonight, President Ross

02:27.490 --> 02:28.660
embraced
the theme of togetherness

02:28.680 --> 02:30.480
in his acceptance speech,

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
but his past
tells a different story,

02:33.530 --> 02:34.570
especially when it comes to
working with heroes

02:34.590 --> 02:35.670
like Captain America.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.550
As two of our nation's
most important leaders,

02:38.570 --> 02:40.560
some question
if they can overcome

02:40.580 --> 02:42.670
their at-times
tumultuous history

02:43.440 --> 02:44.630
to face the challenges ahead.

02:44.650 --> 02:45.630
Here you go, Cap.

02:45.650 --> 02:47.640
During his time as a...

02:48.490 --> 02:50.440
Put your money away.
It's on the house.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.550
Thanks, Charlie.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.490
...leading to Ross

02:54.520 --> 02:56.660
being branded with the moniker
of "the Hulk Hunter."

02:56.680 --> 02:58.610
Following Hulk
and the Abomination's

02:58.630 --> 02:59.680
destruction of Harlem,

03:00.450 --> 03:02.530
Ross was criticized
for what some called

03:02.550 --> 03:05.610
"an unwarranted outburst"
during a press conference.

03:06.530 --> 03:09.520
In fact, many blamed Ross
for the collateral damage,

03:09.540 --> 03:11.480
believing it was his
relentless pursuit

03:11.500 --> 03:13.670
of Banner's Hulk
that led to the rampage.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.480
It also resulted in
the President-elect's

03:16.500 --> 03:17.620
estrangement from
his daughter,

03:17.640 --> 03:21.520
Doctor Betty Ross,
Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend.

03:21.540 --> 03:22.670
But in a surprising turn
of events,

03:23.440 --> 03:24.560
he managed to
shift the narrative,

03:24.580 --> 03:26.560
and silence
his harshest critics

03:26.580 --> 03:28.590
by apprehending
the man responsible

03:28.610 --> 03:29.670
for the Abomination.

03:59.550 --> 04:00.550
How we lookin' down there?

04:00.570 --> 04:01.530
Well, SERPENT mercenaries

04:01.550 --> 04:03.480
entered with a package
about an hour ago.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.550
They're handing it
to the buyer any minute.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.440
We know what they're carrying?

04:07.460 --> 04:08.680
That is classified
per the White House.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.560
Of course it is.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.450
Where's Eagle-One?
We have strike authorization.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.680
Eagle-One is entering
the target airspace now.

04:19.570 --> 04:21.560
Upload the compound's
covert entry points.

04:21.580 --> 04:24.480
Covert? Really?
You must be new.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.650
Wait for it.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.570
Sam, SEAL team
is six minutes out.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.570
Copy that.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.470
How the hell
did he just do that?

05:16.490 --> 05:17.620
Cap's gear was a gift
from the Wakandans

05:17.640 --> 05:18.620
for helping them out.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.580
I heard even the wrapping
paper was made of vibranium.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.560
No, man. I'm kidding. Come on.

05:29.490 --> 05:32.450
Joaquin, Redwing's pickin' up
hostages inside.

05:32.470 --> 05:33.620
-I'm goin' in.
-Negative.

05:33.640 --> 05:34.660
The package is the priority.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.590
Have
the SEALs track the package.

05:36.610 --> 05:38.470
I'm on the hostages.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.620
Redwing, send them a scan
of the building.

05:43.530 --> 05:44.530
What is it?

05:44.550 --> 05:45.560
That's Sidewinder.

05:45.580 --> 05:46.550
He's the head of SERPENT.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.500
He's not supposed to be here.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.620
Ah.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.660
You're praying, Padre.

06:06.610 --> 06:07.680
Padre.

06:13.650 --> 06:17.540
Padre. Padre, Padre, Padre.

06:32.610 --> 06:33.630
Kill them.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.470
- No. No!
- Kill them one at a time.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.650
Silencio!

06:38.670 --> 06:39.670
Captain America is here.

06:40.440 --> 06:40.650
Do you copy?

06:40.670 --> 06:42.610
Move, move, move!

06:42.630 --> 06:45.460
Vámonos, vámonos.

06:47.460 --> 06:48.630
Get the package outta here.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.670
SERPENT's on the move
with the canister, Sam.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.630
I'm kinda busy right now!

07:50.620 --> 07:52.670
Redwing, on my mark.

07:56.470 --> 07:57.470
Stop.

07:59.450 --> 08:00.670
Stay back!
Or we'll shoot them.

08:15.670 --> 08:18.460
SERPENT's gettin' farther away
with the canister, Sam,

08:18.480 --> 08:19.620
and Sidewinder's
headed to the chapel.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.550
I already know
what you're trying to do.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.490
You can't be at two places
at once.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.630
All right, this time.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.460
But don't get yourself killed.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.460
No dying. Copy that.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.650
Buyer didn't show.

08:40.670 --> 08:42.560
Looks like you need
better clients.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.500
You don't need to worry.

08:44.530 --> 08:46.560
I'll find whoever
wasted my time.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.490
You have bigger concerns.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.600
The Captain America
I dreamt of killing

09:15.620 --> 09:16.620
was bigger than you.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.570
I'm happy to disappoint.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.620
I bet you break easy.

09:24.550 --> 09:25.580
Not that easy.

09:38.550 --> 09:39.580
Not that hard.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.530
I heard your rib go.

09:41.550 --> 09:42.520
You need a minute?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.570
Nope. Nope,
let's get this over with.

09:44.590 --> 09:46.550
I got shit to do today.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.620
Whoo-hoo!

10:05.670 --> 10:06.670
Damn.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.540
Nobody saw that.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.470
Sam, package is secured.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.630
I'll add your star
to my collection.

10:31.470 --> 10:32.570
Need a minute?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.500
That's what I thought.

10:53.540 --> 10:54.640
Save some for us, Cap.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.670
He has a fractured arm,
so be gentle.

11:05.550 --> 11:06.550
"Keep your face

11:06.570 --> 11:08.440
always to the sunshine,

11:08.460 --> 11:10.520
and the shadows
will fall behind you."

11:10.540 --> 11:12.660
The quote was Betty's idea.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.660
She's still not speaking
with you?

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
No.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.520
She doesn't believe
I've changed.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.530
Really changed.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.610
I don't think I'm gonna get
another shot.

11:25.670 --> 11:28.580
Comin' up on the end of
my first hundred days, Leila.

11:30.470 --> 11:31.600
They're gonna define me.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.520
This treaty's gotta work.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.450
Hello.

11:41.470 --> 11:43.480
Mr. President,
the mission was a success.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.440
All right, fill me in.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.620
Cap and the
SEAL team saved the hostages.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.680
The package is secure
and en route to the US.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.480
How's your brother?

11:52.500 --> 11:53.640
Oh, wow, you remember.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.560
-He's in the Air Force.
-Yeah.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.450
Probably 'cause of you.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.650
I try not to hold that
against him.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.590
It's a weird place

12:00.610 --> 12:02.460
-for a handoff, right?
-Mm-hmm.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.440
Wide open, soft perimeter.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.650
You think the buyer
ever intended on showin' up?

12:06.670 --> 12:08.530
You think SERPENT got played?

12:08.550 --> 12:09.550
What are they sayin'?

12:09.570 --> 12:11.630
Same thing.
Contract was anonymous.

12:11.650 --> 12:14.680
Fifty mil to steal the
canister en route to Japan.

12:15.450 --> 12:16.620
Then show up here
and meet the buyer.

12:17.490 --> 12:18.490
Hmm.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.460
Let us know if you get a trace
on Sidewinder.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.590
-Good work.
-Thank you.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.660
You'll notice, I did not die,

12:31.680 --> 12:34.440
and people are saying
I did not die in style.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.480
Who is saying that?

12:35.610 --> 12:36.650
-People.
-What people?

12:36.670 --> 12:37.660
Everybody.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.560
Everybody is saying that.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.540
Look, tell me I don't make
your old gear look brand-new.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.660
You've got on the greaves
upside down.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.490
I'm joking.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.630
You look good, man.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.460
All right. Fair enough.

12:49.590 --> 12:50.580
That means that
you're finally gonna

12:50.600 --> 12:51.590
introduce me to Ant-Man?

12:51.610 --> 12:52.640
Nope.

12:53.650 --> 12:54.660
Well, at least
you gotta teach me

12:54.680 --> 12:56.460
your aerial kick, man.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.520
Look, if I'm gonna be Falcon,
I gotta know everything.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.480
In no way
are you ready for that.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.460
But I got a guy who'll
teach you the fundamentals

13:03.480 --> 13:04.470
from the ground up

13:04.490 --> 13:05.490
Absolutely.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.480
Now, he's not a people person.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.450
So you gotta learn
how to keep your mouth shut.

13:09.470 --> 13:10.490
Can you do that?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.540
He's gonna love me, bro!
Are you kidding me?

13:14.560 --> 13:16.640
-That's not the right answer.
-He's gonna love me.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.640
What's up, OG?

13:24.660 --> 13:26.480
Who's the pretty boy?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.680
"Pretty boy"? You didn't
tell gramps about me?

13:28.450 --> 13:29.450
I'm the new Falcon.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.630
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

13:30.650 --> 13:32.600
This is Joaquin Torres.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.550
Been workin' with him
for three years.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.520
I haven't figured out
how to shut him up yet.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.610
So what are we doing here?
Orthopedics? Uh...

13:39.530 --> 13:41.630
How to relearn how to walk
after you break a hip?

13:44.680 --> 13:46.470
Oh, sh--

13:47.630 --> 13:49.470
Oh, shit.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.590
That's Isaiah Bradley.

13:50.610 --> 13:52.650
The-- The Isaiah Bradley?

13:53.570 --> 13:55.440
You brought me to
the forgotten Cap?

13:55.460 --> 13:56.460
Why didn't you say something?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.470
It is a pleasure to meet you.

13:58.490 --> 14:00.640
Your missions in Korea
are legendary.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.530
And what, and after that,
no action?

14:02.550 --> 14:03.640
I mean, a lot's changed
in the world.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.500
We could've used
another super soldier.

14:05.530 --> 14:06.580
The United States government

14:06.600 --> 14:08.640
threw me in prison
for 30 years.

14:08.660 --> 14:11.670
They experimented on me
for decades.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.530
Yikes, that's-- that sucks.

14:14.550 --> 14:15.600
Can we start?

14:15.620 --> 14:16.580
Let's do it.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.490
No vibranium wings,

14:19.540 --> 14:22.560
no shield,
no super soldier serum.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.550
I wanna see
if he's got three in him.

14:26.570 --> 14:28.540
Get those flags, Sam!

14:29.550 --> 14:30.620
Cap v Cap!

14:36.680 --> 14:37.680
That's one.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.480
Let's go!

14:40.660 --> 14:42.460
Orthopedic.

14:46.630 --> 14:47.680
That's two.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.590
I'm sorry.
What were you sayin'?

14:58.460 --> 15:00.450
See? Not a people person.

15:00.470 --> 15:03.470
-In a fight, the last hit...
-Is the only hit that matters.

15:03.490 --> 15:04.670
I know. Shut up, but thanks.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.620
All right, that's it.
Tag me in. I'm ready.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.520
Captain America doesn't
get to take five. Let's go.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.640
I need to take this.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.680
I'm not takin' five.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.460
-You still got the plastic on.
-No! I don't...

15:22.610 --> 15:24.540
Maybe I wanted it on there.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.670
Oh, you want me
to make the text bigger?

15:27.440 --> 15:28.590
So you can read it?

15:28.610 --> 15:30.520
Yeah, I'll hold
for the President.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.440
Where you going?

15:43.520 --> 15:44.540
You wanna talk about it?

15:48.470 --> 15:51.600
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

15:51.620 --> 15:55.500
Captain America,
answering to the President.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.660
The President of the country
who stole your life?

15:57.680 --> 15:59.440
It's not just that.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.660
We're talkin' about
Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.650
Son of a bitch
earned that nickname, too.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.450
Look, I know, Isaiah,
firsthand.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.590
Remember,
Ross threw me in the Raft.

16:09.610 --> 16:12.540
Hounded me, Steve and Natasha
for years.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.530
So why are you
workin' for him?

16:14.530 --> 16:15.620
As long as you do,

16:15.640 --> 16:18.680
Captain America
stands for people like him.

16:19.450 --> 16:21.570
You've got no business
workin' for the government.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.500
You see what's going on
out there?

16:23.680 --> 16:25.640
The country is lost.

16:26.530 --> 16:27.660
Standing next to
the President,

16:27.680 --> 16:29.490
even if it's Ross...

16:30.470 --> 16:31.640
it gives people hope.

16:32.660 --> 16:34.570
Now, come on,
give me some credit.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.580
I have a friend who works
in the White House.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.560
She'll let me know if Ross
starts acting out of turn.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.440
None of this means
I forgot about you.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.600
I see what you're doin'.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.470
What?

16:48.490 --> 16:49.610
Pullin' that counseling
bullshit on me.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.450
Look, trust me.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.550
My eyes are wide open on
this, okay?

16:55.570 --> 16:58.520
I know Ross will never change,

16:59.590 --> 17:01.550
but he is the President.

17:02.590 --> 17:03.650
So you gonna tell me
what he wanted

17:03.670 --> 17:05.610
or are you plannin' on
makin' me guess?

17:07.530 --> 17:09.620
He invited Joaquin and I
to the White House,

17:09.640 --> 17:12.540
and I said
under one condition.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.610
If he extended an invitation
to you as well.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.530
I know you're gonna say no,

17:18.580 --> 17:20.580
but it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

17:21.630 --> 17:22.640
We just...

17:23.590 --> 17:25.500
gotta get you a suit.

17:25.530 --> 17:26.670
I have a damn suit.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.500
For real?

17:28.630 --> 17:29.600
Then why are you
always wearin'

17:29.620 --> 17:31.520
that ratty-ass sweatsuit?

17:33.540 --> 17:35.460
Come on,
you gonna come or what?

17:42.570 --> 17:44.480
See, Isaiah? This is
what I'm talking about.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.660
Now you're going to
the White House. Look at that.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.520
- You look good, OG.
- Wow, man. Damn.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.440
I told you I was gonna get you
out of those sweats.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.620
Look at you now, man.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.470
Yeah, I didn't know
Men's Warehouse
made that size.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.650
Hey, Faith and I
got married in this.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.580
Okay, all right, all right.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
I'm sure she would be proud.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.450
I hope so.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.640
Feels strange to walk right
into the belly of the beast.

18:06.660 --> 18:07.620
Hey, I'm sure
it can't be easy.

18:07.640 --> 18:08.600
It ain't.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.650
Which is why
we gotta celebrate.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.530
I don't care
if it is Ross in charge.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.540
We are guests of honor
at the White House, man!

18:14.560 --> 18:15.660
- When does that ever happen?
- Right.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.540
And they sent us a limo, man.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.610
What?

18:18.630 --> 18:20.550
And we look good.

18:20.570 --> 18:21.530
- Yeah.
- What?

18:21.550 --> 18:23.550
Old school,
you got your smell-good on.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.580
What?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.530
And you got
the houndstooth on.

18:26.590 --> 18:28.650
And we got the good stuff.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.450
It's party time.

18:41.590 --> 18:43.440
Captain America!

18:43.460 --> 18:44.660
Captain, Captain, over here.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.500
- Cap, over here!
- Mr. Bradley.

18:47.530 --> 18:48.530
Over here!

18:48.550 --> 18:49.660
-Hey, Isaiah. Check it out.
-Oh.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.540
Whoa, man, look at this!

19:03.550 --> 19:05.470
Oh, we gotta get a pic.

19:05.490 --> 19:06.490
Let's do it.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.620
Tres amigos on three.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.630
Uno, dos, tres. Ah!

19:13.670 --> 19:15.600
Yeah, that's my
new wallpaper. Look at that.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.630
- Pretty good.
- It's good?

19:16.650 --> 19:17.610
Can you send it to me?

19:17.630 --> 19:19.520
Yeah, I'll AirDrop it to you
right now.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.520
You do know
what AirDrop is, right?

19:21.540 --> 19:23.540
Of course,
I know what AirDrop is.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.500
What's AirDrop?

19:25.640 --> 19:26.640
You see, you should have it.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.520
Just hit "Accept"
and it pops up.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.520
- I did that.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.480
The President
needs Mr. Wilson.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.590
I'll see you guys inside.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.610
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:37.630 --> 19:39.490
Sam, just keep an open mind.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.480
Why? What am I walking into?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.580
Thi-- This is not
the picture you took.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.440
Oh, I sent you
the wrong picture.

19:45.460 --> 19:46.460
Oh, my Lord.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.640
Well, that's
a very good point.

19:48.660 --> 19:49.660
I'll consider it.

19:50.610 --> 19:51.630
Wilson.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.600
Folks, can you give us
the room?

19:56.620 --> 19:57.620
Uh...

19:59.680 --> 20:00.640
Thanks.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.500
Doctor's orders.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.620
Not quite a cigar,
but better than that damn gum.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
Hmm.

20:07.660 --> 20:08.660
Thanks for comin' in.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.570
Welcome to the White House.

20:10.590 --> 20:12.500
Well, thank you
for the invite, sir.

20:12.530 --> 20:15.620
I have to admit, I'm still
gettin' used to the new look.

20:15.640 --> 20:19.620
Yeah, well,
they said lose the mustache

20:19.640 --> 20:21.470
or lose the election.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.490
Thanks for your help
down in Mexico.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.560
Retrieving that canister might
just have saved this treaty.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.550
I was just doing my job, sir.

20:31.570 --> 20:32.630
You and I
haven't always agreed

20:32.650 --> 20:37.470
on how much latitude
enhanced individuals deserve.

20:37.490 --> 20:38.660
But what you've accomplished

20:38.680 --> 20:41.450
has given me reason
to reconsider.

20:42.490 --> 20:46.500
Which is why I want you,
Captain America,

20:46.530 --> 20:49.550
to help me
rebuild the Avengers.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.580
-The Avengers?
-Yes, sir.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.480
Well, with
all due respect, sir,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.620
when you passed
the Sokovia Accords,

21:01.640 --> 21:03.460
you tore the Avengers apart.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.490
Why the change of heart?

21:04.520 --> 21:07.440
I represent all Americans now.

21:08.640 --> 21:12.660
Hell, half of 'em
wouldn't even
be here without the Avengers.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.680
The country needs this.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.600
And when we disagree on
how to manage a situation...

21:21.540 --> 21:22.610
what happens then?

21:23.540 --> 21:24.580
We figure it out together.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.650
Look, you don't have to
give me an answer now.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.670
Just think about it.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.620
Prime Minister Ozaki.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.530
-Great to see you, sir.
-And you.

21:40.550 --> 21:41.600
Thank you for being here.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.570
Here we are.

21:45.590 --> 21:48.480
Sam Wilson,
Prime Minister Ozaki.

21:51.580 --> 21:53.500
Not bad.

21:53.530 --> 21:54.560
Would you like a picture?

21:54.580 --> 21:55.560
Sure.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.630
Sam, please.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.540
Now,
stand a little bit closer.

22:02.550 --> 22:04.460
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.570
Thank you.

22:07.620 --> 22:08.620
Work with me, Sam.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.620
We'll show the world
a better way forward.

22:18.450 --> 22:19.630
That was unexpected.

22:19.650 --> 22:21.560
Maybe it's an opportunity.

22:27.550 --> 22:28.550
So?

22:28.670 --> 22:29.640
How was it?

22:29.660 --> 22:31.670
He asked me
to restart the Avengers.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.470
Wait, what now?

22:34.490 --> 22:35.630
-That's huge, man.
-I don't know.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.530
We'd have to work for him.

22:38.550 --> 22:39.570
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:39.590 --> 22:43.470
the President of the
United States, Thaddeus Ross.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.610
Good evening, everyone.
Good evening.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.660
It's my great privilege
to host you

22:49.680 --> 22:53.490
at the White House
on this historic evening.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.440
When the celestial mass
emerged in the Indian Ocean,

22:58.650 --> 23:01.570
we did what we often do.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.590
We squabbled over it.

23:03.610 --> 23:07.470
Countries rushed in
to claim it as their own,

23:07.490 --> 23:12.450
setting up research facilities
to exploit its resources.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.500
What was found
inside that island

23:15.530 --> 23:18.560
is nothing short of
the discovery
of the millennium.

23:19.540 --> 23:23.440
Its potential applications
in tech, in medicine,

23:23.460 --> 23:25.650
in defense are immeasurable.

23:26.610 --> 23:30.600
It's even more indestructible
than vibranium.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.680
And it's not controlled
by an isolationist nation.

23:36.530 --> 23:37.650
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:37.670 --> 23:39.560
I present to you...

23:40.520 --> 23:41.480
adamantium.

23:45.660 --> 23:49.530
The first and only
refined sample

23:49.550 --> 23:51.620
was stolen from
a Japanese mining site.

23:51.640 --> 23:56.530
But happily,
it's been recovered
and is in a secure location.

23:56.550 --> 24:01.500
And we have two incredibly
brave men to thank for that.

24:01.530 --> 24:05.680
Joaquin Torres and our own
Captain America, Sam Wilson.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.570
What we do next
with this discovery

24:21.440 --> 24:24.480
will determine
how history judges us.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.490
If we ratify this treaty,

24:26.520 --> 24:29.630
together we can produce
enough adamantium

24:29.650 --> 24:32.670
to fairly and equitably
distribute it
around the world.

24:36.590 --> 24:37.660
Sir, you need to sit down.

24:40.550 --> 24:43.440
Isaiah! What are you doing?

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
Sam!

24:59.450 --> 25:00.560
-Sir, are you hit?
-No.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.480
Go, go, go!

25:23.460 --> 25:24.680
Mr. President, come with me.

25:56.650 --> 25:57.650
Shit.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.560
Isaiah!

26:30.650 --> 26:32.650
-Get on the ground now!
-Do not move.

26:37.580 --> 26:38.680
What's happening?

26:39.600 --> 26:42.520
I don't know.
But you gotta stop.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.640
- Stop!
- Don't!

26:50.640 --> 26:53.650
I can't go back inside, Sam.

26:53.670 --> 26:56.530
Run, and it'll be
worse than that.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.440
Please, Isaiah.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.550
Hey, take it easy!

27:18.570 --> 27:20.670
Watch my suit.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.450
Please, watch my suit.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.590
Cap, I can't let you in.

27:40.670 --> 27:42.490
Hey!

27:42.520 --> 27:43.580
Sam!

27:43.600 --> 27:46.470
Sir, you can't-- you can't--

27:47.450 --> 27:47.660
Sir!

27:48.550 --> 27:50.590
- Sorry, Mr. President.
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:50.610 --> 27:51.660
He stays.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.550
Everybody else, out.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.640
Agent Taylor, you too.

28:08.550 --> 28:09.590
Are you okay?

28:10.550 --> 28:12.500
I should be asking
you that, sir.

28:12.530 --> 28:13.680
Not my first time
being shot at.

28:14.450 --> 28:15.560
Look, I know how
this must look, but...

28:18.590 --> 28:19.650
Can we have a minute?

28:21.610 --> 28:22.610
She stays.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.470
Meet Ruth Bat-Seraph,
my security advisor.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.500
Sir, there's no way
Isaiah could have done this.

28:33.530 --> 28:35.450
-Except he did.
-Maybe somebody got to him.

28:35.470 --> 28:36.530
You're really defending a man

28:36.550 --> 28:38.590
who just tried to kill
the President in front...

28:38.610 --> 28:41.590
-We don't know what happened.
-Enough.

28:43.630 --> 28:44.600
What do we know?

28:45.470 --> 28:45.680
There were five shooters.

28:46.450 --> 28:47.640
Isaiah was one of them.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.680
As was Secret Service
and active military.

28:50.450 --> 28:52.590
This was a coordinated
terrorist attack, sir.

28:58.580 --> 28:59.580
What else do you have?

29:00.460 --> 29:01.540
The song
that preceded the shooting,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.480
we think it was a cue
for the attack.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.450
Sir, Isaiah looked like
he wasn't in control.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.620
He had no idea where he was.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.580
So you're suggesting what?

29:08.600 --> 29:09.650
Let me investigate.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.490
Don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

29:13.520 --> 29:15.520
Sir, your inner circle
has been compromised.

29:15.540 --> 29:17.560
There's possibility
of another attack now.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.450
And what exactly
do you have to offer

29:19.470 --> 29:21.670
that our entire intelligence
and defense apparatus can't?

29:22.440 --> 29:23.580
Well, I won't sit around
and let Isaiah...

29:23.600 --> 29:27.490
Look, I know how important
Bradley is to you.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.470
But consider the optics.

29:30.550 --> 29:33.660
Captain America conducts
a personal investigation

29:33.680 --> 29:37.600
of a friend who tried
to assassinate the President.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.610
Isaiah sacrificed everything
for this country.

29:40.630 --> 29:42.680
He's a soldier. A patriot.

29:43.450 --> 29:44.550
He had no reason to do this.

29:44.570 --> 29:46.520
He had every reason.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.610
Bradley was in prison
for rescuing his own men,

29:48.630 --> 29:51.480
experimented on for 30 years.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.650
The things done to him are
enough to make anyone snap.

29:54.590 --> 29:56.590
Sir, you invited me here
to work together.

29:56.610 --> 29:59.560
-So let's work together.
-I'm afraid that offer expired

29:59.580 --> 30:01.530
when your friend tried
to kill me.

30:06.470 --> 30:10.570
Sam, you shouldn't even be
in these situations.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.460
You're not Steve Rogers.

30:16.620 --> 30:17.650
Ruth,

30:17.670 --> 30:20.530
you have my full authority
to put this thing to bed.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.660
Before this treaty
gets compromised any further.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.560
So that's it?

30:29.640 --> 30:30.640
I'm done?

30:31.560 --> 30:32.600
You're done.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.620
This is bullshit,
and you know it.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.480
This is politics.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.660
So you better wise up, son.

30:41.490 --> 30:42.660
"Son." Who you calling "son"?

30:42.680 --> 30:44.650
Sam. What the hell
are you doing?

30:44.670 --> 30:46.460
I'm going to clear Isaiah.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.620
Storming in there
ain't gonna help him.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.630
-You need Ross on your side.
-Ross?

30:50.530 --> 30:51.590
Open your eyes.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.480
I offer to help,
and he sends me packin'.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.680
Ross is on his own side.
He always has been.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.460
Either you can't see that,
or you don't want to.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.440
Hey.

31:00.470 --> 31:01.480
Don't be that guy.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.670
And what guy is that?

31:03.440 --> 31:04.590
The one who has to do it
the hard way.

31:10.670 --> 31:12.610
Looks like I am that guy.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.450
The nation remains
on high alert.

31:38.470 --> 31:41.490
The Justice Department has
signaled a death penalty case

31:41.520 --> 31:43.680
will be pursued
against Isaiah Bradley.

31:44.450 --> 31:45.630
Just five minutes, Cap.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.670
I could be court-martialed
for this.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.490
I appreciate it, Payumo.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.520
Yes, sir.

32:19.650 --> 32:21.550
How you holdin' up?

32:22.500 --> 32:24.470
Not so good, brother Sam.

32:25.530 --> 32:26.530
Isaiah.

32:27.550 --> 32:28.550
Look me in the eye.

32:28.570 --> 32:30.630
Tell me you didn't
conspire to kill Ross.

32:30.650 --> 32:31.670
Of course I didn't.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.460
What in the world happened

32:33.480 --> 32:34.610
to make you shoot
at the President?

32:34.630 --> 32:35.630
I don't know.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.630
You gotta give me more
than "I don't know."

32:38.580 --> 32:40.540
Is there anything
you remember?

32:40.670 --> 32:42.550
I got a haircut,

32:42.570 --> 32:44.640
picked my suit up at
the cleaners and came to you.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.480
We rode in the limo,

32:49.650 --> 32:51.540
took our photo.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.680
But my phone was on the fritz.

32:55.450 --> 32:58.610
And then, we went over
to the East Room.

33:00.490 --> 33:01.630
One moment I'm sittin' there,

33:01.650 --> 33:03.650
the next I'm standin'
in that park.

33:05.630 --> 33:08.550
I should have stayed
in my damn house,

33:08.570 --> 33:09.680
minded my business.

33:10.450 --> 33:11.440
No, this isn't on you.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.590
Someone's behind all this.

33:12.610 --> 33:16.610
Sam, the last thing I want
is for this to touch you.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.650
Besides...

33:30.590 --> 33:33.680
Look, there ain't no escapin'
for me this time.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.610
I'm gonna die in here.

33:37.630 --> 33:39.560
No, you're not.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.640
I'm gonna get you out.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.600
- You wanna help me?
- Of course.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.480
Don't come back.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.520
Guard.

34:15.490 --> 34:17.680
Sergeant Payumo, get me
a copy of that conversation.

34:19.490 --> 34:20.540
I wanna take another look.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.570
Yes, ma'am.

34:21.590 --> 34:23.580
And good work with Wilson.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.440
Let me know
if he pays another visit.

34:26.460 --> 34:27.460
Roger that.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.520
You get in?

34:31.540 --> 34:33.550
I think I committed
treason and espionage,

34:33.570 --> 34:36.630
but I made it into
the White House's CCTV system.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.480
What am I lookin' for?

34:38.500 --> 34:40.450
When Isaiah went off
in the White House,

34:40.470 --> 34:41.680
it made me think
of a friend of mine.

34:42.450 --> 34:44.490
He was being controlled
by trigger words.

34:44.520 --> 34:46.550
Do you see any strangers
talkin' to Isaiah?

34:46.570 --> 34:49.500
No, well,
we got there, took a picture,

34:49.530 --> 34:51.530
I AirDropped it to him,
but nothin' crazy.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.590
Yeah, but he said his phone
was on the fritz.

34:53.610 --> 34:54.630
Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.450
Sam, I think I got something.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.620
What is it?

34:58.640 --> 35:01.450
His phone is like
flashing at him.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.470
Oh, shit, I got
the same thing happening

35:05.490 --> 35:06.570
to one of the other shooters.

35:29.550 --> 35:31.520
What the hell?

35:35.610 --> 35:37.660
Warden Cooper, Ross here.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.620
The prisoner, he's secure?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.650
I can confirm the prisoner
is in his cell.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.560
Do we have eyes
on the bastard?

35:44.580 --> 35:45.570
Personally.

35:45.590 --> 35:47.520
I'm looking at him
right now, sir.

35:47.540 --> 35:48.570
Thank you, Cooper.

35:50.490 --> 35:51.680
Thank you, Mr. President.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.570
I keep goin' back to Mexico.

36:00.590 --> 36:01.620
We were at the White House

36:01.640 --> 36:03.460
because the buyer
never showed.

36:04.470 --> 36:07.620
Why hire SERPENT if you have
no intention on collecting?

36:07.640 --> 36:09.610
Maybe they were expecting
Captain America to come.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.680
What if the buyer wanted
Captain America to come?

36:12.450 --> 36:13.620
And what if they wanted us
at the White House?

36:13.640 --> 36:15.470
But how would
the buyer predict

36:15.490 --> 36:18.650
that we'd get the invite, or
that you would invite Isaiah?

36:18.670 --> 36:20.660
The buyer must be
watching us somehow.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.650
Another thing.

36:22.670 --> 36:26.560
Ruth Bat-Seraph,
Ross's security advisor,

36:27.550 --> 36:28.660
find out what you can
about her.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.460
Copy that.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.550
I'll call you back later.

37:02.610 --> 37:04.450
Target eliminated.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.590
Stand by for proof of death.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.500
Hmm.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.630
No way you came
all the way from Mexico

37:33.650 --> 37:35.500
just to blow up my car.

37:35.530 --> 37:37.530
So you must have made up
with the buyer.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.520
Get him on the phone.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.450
Let me see
if I can resolve this.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.480
"Resolve this"?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.680
The buyer told me everything.

37:48.630 --> 37:52.570
He mentioned that if you
survived the grenade,

37:52.590 --> 37:58.550
there was a 77% chance
you'd try to talk me down.

37:59.460 --> 38:00.440
Hmm.

38:00.460 --> 38:01.500
Look at that.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.660
The buyer told me
a lot actually.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.650
After he didn't show
in Mexico,

38:37.670 --> 38:40.580
he agreed to pay me double
to take you out.

38:40.600 --> 38:45.500
What he doesn't know is that
I would kill you for free.

38:45.620 --> 38:50.550
How often do you get a chance
to kill Captain America?

39:02.500 --> 39:04.530
You're desperate
without your gear.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.530
Nope.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.640
Just a little meaner.

39:21.540 --> 39:22.500
Hello.

39:22.530 --> 39:23.650
Well done, Captain.

39:23.670 --> 39:26.540
But you're not going to like
what's coming next.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.600
Who is this?

39:35.660 --> 39:38.520
How can we trust you to lead

39:38.540 --> 39:41.590
when you can't even keep
your own house in order?

39:43.490 --> 39:45.490
We have the shooters
in custody.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.460
All I'm asking for
is patience.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.620
Patience?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.540
From the Hulk Hunter?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.540
That was a long time ago.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.520
Well, Mr. President,

39:56.540 --> 39:59.670
I was almost killed
in your home yesterday.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.560
And today, you are still
locked in your bunker.

40:03.580 --> 40:06.650
You are not in a position
to be asking for anything.

40:06.670 --> 40:07.670
I agree.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.610
We should continue this
conversation another time.

40:10.630 --> 40:12.600
Gentlemen, wait.

40:12.620 --> 40:13.670
Please.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.620
This treaty is too important
to let it fall apart now.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.560
We made a promise
to our people.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.620
We made a promise
to the world.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.530
We must prevail.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.490
We'll need Japan to proceed.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.500
And
Prime Minister Ozaki's absence

40:32.530 --> 40:33.610
speaks volumes.

40:33.630 --> 40:35.660
I'll get Japan back
to the table.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.470
Ozaki and I go back
a long way.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.630
He's running for re-election.

40:40.650 --> 40:43.670
He needs to assert leadership
on this treaty.

40:44.610 --> 40:48.550
All right, Mr. President,
we'll remain patient

40:48.570 --> 40:51.500
while you try
to get Japan on board.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.470
But if you don't,

40:53.490 --> 40:56.590
we'll have to take
measures into our own hands.

41:01.650 --> 41:03.500
I've gotta get out of here.

41:03.530 --> 41:04.500
Sit down.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.630
Sir, the sweep's not complete.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.560
The longer I stay here,

41:09.490 --> 41:10.630
the weaker I look.

41:21.460 --> 41:22.500
The hell happened to you?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.650
Sidewinder tracked me down.

41:25.670 --> 41:28.470
Well, it looks like
he did a lot more than that.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.650
He's in police custody now.

41:33.590 --> 41:35.570
-Shit, you good?
-I will be.

41:35.590 --> 41:37.550
Last call, trace it.

41:38.620 --> 41:39.620
All right.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.450
Yo, get this.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.540
Ross' advisor,
Ruth Bat-Seraph,

41:49.670 --> 41:52.590
she was born in Israel
and trained in the Red Room.

41:52.610 --> 41:53.600
She's ex-Widow.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.640
That basically means
stay the hell out of her way.

41:55.660 --> 41:56.640
Trust me.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.680
Yep.

42:04.660 --> 42:06.450
Now, this is weird.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.550
Isaiah had Ross
in his crosshairs.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.490
Couldn't miss.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.500
I don't get it.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.610
Why go through all that
trouble just to not kill Ross?

42:15.490 --> 42:16.480
I don't know.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.460
Oh, shit.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.540
I think I located
Sidewinder's last caller.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.610
It's in the middle of nowhere,
West Virginia.

42:22.630 --> 42:25.520
It's just, like,
near some forest.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.530
Database only shows one name.

42:27.550 --> 42:29.440
Camp Echo One.

42:30.550 --> 42:31.680
No satellite imagery.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.530
Away from air traffic.

42:35.540 --> 42:37.610
No infrastructure in the area.

42:38.490 --> 42:39.600
-Do you think it's military?
-Yep.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.670
It's a place they send you
and you never leave.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.600
Ross told me stay out of this.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.600
Eh, he's just the President
of the United States.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.640
You don't have to come
with me.

43:11.640 --> 43:14.470
Duh, I know.
That's what makes it so noble.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.560
Pack as much gear
as you can carry.

43:17.580 --> 43:19.480
I don't know
when we'll be back.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.630
What, you mean like,
"right now" right now?

43:22.650 --> 43:24.440
Yeah.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.460
Oh, shit. Okay.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.580
Well, it's a long-ass drive
to West Virginia,

43:28.600 --> 43:29.670
so we're gonna need
some snacks.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.590
Why did I invite you?

43:31.610 --> 43:33.460
What? Wait, wait, wait.

43:36.460 --> 43:37.460
Wait up!

43:37.600 --> 43:38.670
Ruth Bat-Seraph.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.470
Isaiah Bradley's
in holding cell 14.

43:41.490 --> 43:43.460
-The other shooters are in 15.
-Okay.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.520
Do you need an escort?

43:45.470 --> 43:46.630
Think I'll be just fine.

43:46.650 --> 43:48.470
-Thanks.
-Yes, ma'am.

43:56.470 --> 43:57.600
I'd like to speak to them
one at a time.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.580
Can you... Excuse me?

43:59.600 --> 44:01.680
Payumo.
I'm talking to you. Hey.

44:04.490 --> 44:05.640
Stop! Drop your weapon!

44:07.650 --> 44:09.580
Payumo, what are you doing?

44:10.460 --> 44:11.530
Drop it.

44:32.490 --> 44:33.590
Increase that cadence

44:33.610 --> 44:34.640
and resistance.

44:34.660 --> 44:36.490
Or do whatever the hell
you need to do to get there,

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
all right?

44:37.640 --> 44:40.640
Just stay in your lane.
Stay in your lane. Here we go.

44:41.540 --> 44:42.540
Out to third!

44:42.560 --> 44:44.540
Eye on the prize.
Eye on the target, baby.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.600
- That's enough.
- Don't think about speed now.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.520
Think about direction.
Think about intention.

44:48.670 --> 44:51.460
If Doctor Eccles asks,

44:51.640 --> 44:55.660
you tell her
I did the whole five miles.

44:58.640 --> 45:01.450
That look.

45:01.550 --> 45:03.660
We touch down in Tokyo
at 0600.

45:05.560 --> 45:08.490
You still think
this is a bad idea?

45:08.520 --> 45:09.610
Sir, whoever orchestrated
the attack

45:09.630 --> 45:11.630
on the White House is still
in the wild.

45:11.650 --> 45:13.670
International travel
brings security risks

45:14.440 --> 45:15.490
we can't anticipate.

45:16.490 --> 45:19.460
We barely got Congress
together on this thing.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.500
If we lose
our international partners,

45:23.440 --> 45:24.610
this treaty's toast.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.650
I have to make this work.

45:29.530 --> 45:30.630
Three miles and change.

45:30.650 --> 45:32.560
I'll let Dr. Eccles know.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.440
Five.

45:34.460 --> 45:35.640
-Five.
-Five.

45:35.660 --> 45:37.530
Do we have eyes on Wilson?

45:37.550 --> 45:39.660
He left the base a few hours
ago with Joaquin Torres.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.440
They ditched
their smartphones.

45:41.460 --> 45:42.560
They're off-grid.

45:42.580 --> 45:44.460
Well, I don't want a variable
out there

45:44.480 --> 45:45.620
that I can't control.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.480
Get a team,
pick him up, bring him in.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.600
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

45:50.470 --> 45:51.660
Breaking
news out of Washington,

45:51.680 --> 45:53.630
President Ross is
on his way to Japan

45:53.650 --> 45:55.680
just a day after surviving
an assassination attempt...

45:56.450 --> 45:58.500
Bet you used to play this
old-ass game all the time.

45:58.530 --> 45:59.530
Damn it.
This is hard.

45:59.550 --> 46:00.530
Right.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.630
The high-stakes
diplomatic visit...

46:01.650 --> 46:03.520
How far are we
from Camp Echo One?

46:04.450 --> 46:06.610
...over control
of Celestial Island.

46:06.630 --> 46:09.440
We're about, like,
an hour away.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.500
Sam, shit. They just
shot up Isaiah's prison.

46:17.630 --> 46:19.470
Is he okay?

46:19.490 --> 46:20.660
Yeah, Isaiah's good,
but the others...

46:21.530 --> 46:22.550
they're dead.

46:22.570 --> 46:23.610
Shit.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.650
Should we go back?

46:28.440 --> 46:29.480
No.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.490
We keep going.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.490
The buyer is pretty smart,
but we're not taking the bait.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.530
Only way to help Isaiah is to
figure out who's behind this.

46:36.550 --> 46:37.660
And whoever is behind it,

46:38.570 --> 46:40.560
they do not want
us getting closer.

46:46.490 --> 46:47.470
Cooper.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
What's happening?

46:48.620 --> 46:51.560
Mr. President,
as a precautionary measure,

46:51.580 --> 46:53.450
I have moved the prisoner to--

46:55.440 --> 46:59.480
President Ross,
I miss our little visits.

46:59.610 --> 47:00.650
Tell me something.

47:00.670 --> 47:03.500
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself

47:03.530 --> 47:04.660
who's playing the music?

47:04.680 --> 47:06.480
It's you.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.530
The White House,

47:08.550 --> 47:09.650
the assassination attempt.

47:09.670 --> 47:11.650
That's a way of putting it.

47:11.670 --> 47:14.680
I helped you more
than anyone else.

47:15.450 --> 47:16.590
Only to get what you want.

47:16.610 --> 47:17.610
What do you want?

47:17.630 --> 47:21.540
I wanted my life back, but
it's too late for that now.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.600
You've gotta--

47:22.620 --> 47:24.620
You gotta understand
my position.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.590
-I...
-Oh, I do.

47:27.460 --> 47:30.520
You let me rot in this prison.

47:30.540 --> 47:32.630
And it was my curse
to watch your betrayal

47:32.650 --> 47:34.600
written in probabilities.

47:35.610 --> 47:38.570
I'm making my own choices now.

47:38.590 --> 47:41.440
So many surprises left.

47:41.460 --> 47:42.460
When I'm done,

47:42.480 --> 47:45.470
everyone will know
just who you are,

47:45.490 --> 47:48.490
and Betty will despise you
even more.

47:49.460 --> 47:50.550
Goodbye, Mr. President.

47:54.470 --> 47:55.530
The hell is going on?

47:55.660 --> 47:57.570
I'm putting you in solitary.

47:57.590 --> 47:58.590
Yeah.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.560
Nobody's gonna put me
in solitary ever again.

48:01.580 --> 48:02.660
It's for your protection.

48:03.620 --> 48:06.620
I'll tell you this one more
time for your protection,

48:06.640 --> 48:09.550
I ain't goin'
in a box ever again.

48:10.550 --> 48:12.630
I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

48:12.650 --> 48:14.640
Safety ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

48:16.500 --> 48:17.460
You still think

48:17.480 --> 48:18.590
I had somethin'
to do with all of this?

48:19.590 --> 48:20.570
I don't know.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.600
Mr. President.

48:27.620 --> 48:29.570
I need you
to drop whatever you're doin'.

48:29.590 --> 48:31.490
Camp Echo One's
been compromised.

48:31.650 --> 48:33.440
Yes, Mr. President.

49:00.660 --> 49:01.660
This is it.

49:02.620 --> 49:03.650
Camp Echo One.

49:06.450 --> 49:08.540
Telescopes must be a facade.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.440
We gotta see
what's underneath.

49:13.670 --> 49:15.660
We've got cameras and guards.

49:15.680 --> 49:18.500
Redwing, cut the fence
and go loop the feed.

49:23.590 --> 49:26.660
Yeah, we got a 28-second
window to get past the guards.

49:26.680 --> 49:28.610
We gotta do the door manually.

49:30.590 --> 49:32.650
Three, two, one,

49:33.540 --> 49:34.490
go.

49:48.460 --> 49:48.670
15 seconds.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.590
I'm trying, man!

49:51.570 --> 49:52.580
Shit!

50:40.520 --> 50:41.620
There's no prisoners in here.

51:30.540 --> 51:32.620
Why is there a lab
in this prison?

51:40.650 --> 51:42.520
What the hell is this place?

52:55.460 --> 52:56.570
What the hell?

53:03.580 --> 53:04.580
Ozaki-san,

53:04.600 --> 53:06.460
I want to assure you

53:06.480 --> 53:09.520
America remains committed
to sharing our adamantium

53:09.540 --> 53:11.490
with the rest of the world.

53:11.520 --> 53:14.600
I trust Japan shares
that commitment.

53:15.480 --> 53:17.460
The world needs this treaty.

53:20.570 --> 53:22.550
Diplomacy must be hard
for you

53:23.490 --> 53:24.640
A man in a country

53:24.660 --> 53:27.530
so used to taking
whatever he wants by force.

53:28.440 --> 53:29.550
Excuse me?

53:29.570 --> 53:31.670
How else to explain your theft
of our adamantium,

53:32.440 --> 53:35.460
only to return it to us
in Washington.

53:35.590 --> 53:38.590
What you're accusing us of
is baseless

53:38.610 --> 53:40.630
and insulting.

53:40.650 --> 53:44.560
So, the information
my intelligence team received

53:44.580 --> 53:45.680
and verified

53:46.450 --> 53:47.630
is incorrect?

53:52.660 --> 53:54.460
Wh--

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
I'm a fool.

54:03.540 --> 54:06.650
I'm a fool to negotiate
with someone so naive

54:06.670 --> 54:09.530
they don't realize
they're being played.

54:10.490 --> 54:11.490
Naive?

54:12.600 --> 54:14.540
If I'd stolen the sample,

54:14.670 --> 54:18.630
why would I order Captain
America to retrieve it?

54:18.650 --> 54:21.580
I suppose
we'll never know the truth.

54:27.610 --> 54:30.620
Whatever game you're playing,
Japan wants no part in it.

54:31.580 --> 54:33.490
Don't test us, Mr. President.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.640
He's got optogenetic data
on a lot of people.

54:43.580 --> 54:45.550
Don't make me look up words,
Joaquin.

54:45.570 --> 54:47.490
I think he's figured out a way
to plant commands

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
into people's subconscious

54:48.540 --> 54:50.440
using flashes of light.

54:50.580 --> 54:53.470
This "Mr. Blue" song seems
to be some kind of trigger.

54:53.490 --> 54:54.530
Mind control.

54:55.450 --> 54:56.450
Yeah.

54:56.470 --> 54:57.630
That explains Isaiah.

55:03.660 --> 55:05.640
And that's more important.

55:06.530 --> 55:07.530
Take risks.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.520
Use those incredible brains
of yours.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.560
Wasn't
half bad-looking, was I?

55:18.660 --> 55:20.520
Samuel Sterns.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.460
You know, it takes
an awful lot to surprise me.

55:28.530 --> 55:31.590
There was an 89% chance
you'd turn around

55:31.610 --> 55:33.670
if I put Isaiah Bradley
at risk,

55:34.650 --> 55:36.620
yet here you stand.

55:38.500 --> 55:39.530
You're the buyer.

55:39.550 --> 55:40.550
Indeed.

55:40.570 --> 55:43.450
Hiring SERPENT was
a necessary step

55:43.470 --> 55:46.490
to create a chain
of statistical certainties.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.470
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.470
I am, actually.

55:51.490 --> 55:54.440
My mind sees it all,
every probable outcome.

55:54.660 --> 55:57.640
So you hire SERPENT
to steal the adamantium,

55:57.660 --> 56:00.490
shoot up Ross' summit
announcing it

56:00.520 --> 56:02.540
and now you're just
sitting here, waiting.

56:03.530 --> 56:05.450
Why do you wanna kill Ross?

56:05.470 --> 56:09.440
Why does everyone think that
I wanna kill Ross?

56:09.570 --> 56:13.570
Is it because he imprisoned me
here without a trial

56:13.590 --> 56:16.530
after an infusion of gamma
warped the structure

56:16.550 --> 56:17.550
of my brain?

56:21.570 --> 56:23.500
Damn.

56:23.530 --> 56:26.460
Once Ross discovered
how useful I could be,

56:26.480 --> 56:29.490
he kept me here for 16 years,

56:29.520 --> 56:32.460
turning my mind
to solving his problems.

56:32.570 --> 56:35.680
My solutions brought him the
highest office in the country.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.670
If I wanted Ross dead,
he'd be dead.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.440
Well, whatever you're doing,

56:43.570 --> 56:46.540
you're hurting a lot of
people, including my friend.

56:46.560 --> 56:49.490
So this is the last chance
I'm gonna give you to stop it.

56:49.520 --> 56:51.480
Why are you protecting him?

56:51.590 --> 56:54.520
Ross knows I'm responsible
for the White House,

56:54.540 --> 56:57.500
yet he's still letting Isaiah
sit in prison for it.

56:57.530 --> 56:58.620
You know he'll never change.

56:59.530 --> 57:00.570
Let me finish my work.

57:00.590 --> 57:02.450
I'm afraid I can't do that.

57:07.550 --> 57:10.530
Please don't be boring!

57:17.660 --> 57:19.550
You think they'll stop us?

57:19.570 --> 57:20.660
For long enough.

57:20.680 --> 57:22.600
You're a fascinating problem.

57:23.580 --> 57:25.670
But soon
you'll be off the board,

57:26.440 --> 57:27.680
so you don't
surprise me again.

57:29.530 --> 57:31.540
This is messed up, man.
It's not even their choice.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.480
I know.
Just try and neutralize.

58:40.650 --> 58:41.650
Punk-ass.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.530
Stand down!

59:01.550 --> 59:02.660
I'm taking them in.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.650
I'll deal with these two.

59:06.660 --> 59:08.620
Okay.

59:33.590 --> 59:35.490
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

59:35.520 --> 59:37.520
Well, that's what
I should be asking you.

59:37.620 --> 59:38.640
Where's Sterns?

59:40.550 --> 59:42.620
If Sterns is in the wind,
we need to set a perimeter,

59:42.640 --> 59:44.490
roadblocks, air support.

59:44.520 --> 59:45.610
He can't have gone far.

59:45.630 --> 59:46.680
Why are you helping us?

59:47.600 --> 59:49.640
'Cause you were right.
I thought that was obvious.

59:50.590 --> 59:51.630
- Freeze!
- Oh. It's okay.

59:51.650 --> 59:54.450
We have orders to take
Captain America into custody.

59:54.470 --> 59:55.660
You already have one
Captain America in custody.

59:55.680 --> 59:57.470
You want another?

59:57.490 --> 59:58.600
You're under arrest
for trespassing

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.550
on restricted
government property.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.480
Being right
always go like this?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.560
Most of the time.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.520
I have the clearances.
It's been a long day.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.650
She's ex-Widow.
Just zap the guy.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.470
These orders come
from the President himself.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:15.580
Get them out of here.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.670
Then we'll just call him.

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.570
Ruth, uncuff us now!

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.620
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Not again.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.630
- Run!
- Go, go, go. Come on.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.610
Go!

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600
Mr. President,

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.450
Japan's claim
seems to be true.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.660
We're trying to determine
the point of the breach.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.650
Sir, we have to tell
Ozaki's team something.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.480
We've got to stop
the bleeding.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.610
I need some time alone.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.460
We don't have much time, sir.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.460
Ozaki just decided to advance
his navy on Celestial Island.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.610
He intends to secure
the adamantium for himself.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:00.630
Jesus.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:02.640
France and India are drawing
up occupation strategies...

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.450
Mr. President, I suggest that
we return to DC immediately.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.500
-No, I disagree.
-Immediately.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.640
We are going to lose
our opportunity with Ozaki.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.600
We need to regroup and figure
out a different solution.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.540
We can't do that.
No, absolutely not!

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.570
We need to ask
for another meeting, sir.

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:13.560
If we call on Ozaki now,

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.590
and try to reach out to him,
we can...

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.490
We're not gonna miss
the opportunity.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.680
We have to have
another meeting!

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.550
I want Carrier Strike Group
Five deployed immediately.

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.440
Tell 'em
I'm on my way there now.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.620
Sir, are we seriously
talking about taking control

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.650
of Japan's adamantium?

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:45.600
I'm not going home
empty-handed.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:49.480
If only one country is going
to control adamantium,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.670
it's going to be us.

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.610
Make the call!

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.610
Taylor!

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.650
The President has informed me

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.480
that we need to move
Strike Group Five

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.640
to Celestial Island
immediately.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.650
I want to be en route to the
Indian Ocean within the hour.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:13.560
Mr. President,
this is extremely dangerous.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.580
If a war breaks out...

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.490
I was a wartime general.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.530
Now I'm a wartime president.

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:24.670
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:50.530
What are we doing here?

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.640
You say Ross' orders was
to take us into custody

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.600
so I called in a favor.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.590
Thanks for doing this.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.530
No problem, Cap. Brass never
makes it down here.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.440
Terminal's set up,
ready to go.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:04.440
You sure you can knock out
Sterns' mind control?

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.540
I should be able
to run a program

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.610
that blocks the light signals

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:09.520
that Sterns has been
sending out to control people.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.560
What if
he's already gotten someone?

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.590
That's a good point.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:18.680
Are you crazy?

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.590
We're clear here, at least.

01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:29.490
You have anybody
that you trust

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.530
that can take a look at these
and tell me what's in 'em?

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:32.650
Sure, I got someone.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.440
I'll get on it.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.470
-Thanks. Our guy here?
-Through there.

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:38.470
Listen in.

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.610
I'm amazed
you're still standing. Hmm.

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:47.640
Most men don't survive
an axe to the gut.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.540
Kevlar weave, I presume?

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.610
Perks of the job.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.520
You said you were gonna find
the man who wasted your time.

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:56.450
I wanna know what you learned.

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:57.530
Samuel Sterns.

01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.540
Gruesome fella,
don't you think?

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.440
I've seen worse.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.530
Not without your Avengers.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.680
Full immunity and I'll talk.

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:07.500
You're crazy.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:08.530
Who you kiddin'?

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.450
You're here because
you're all out of options.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:11.650
You heard
what he did to those shooters.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.620
A guy like Sterns doesn't like
loose ends alive.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.640
Reduced sentence,
Allenwood, my own cell.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.480
Lemme hear what you got first.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:27.630
You know, it was my old unit
that found Sterns

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:28.660
in the wreckage of Harlem.

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:32.470
They said he'd been infected
with Bruce Banner's blood,

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.660
but it didn't
give him strength.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.660
What did it give him?

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.450
A mind capable
of impossible calculations.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.620
Ross being Ross,

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.470
he saw an opportunity.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.590
Instead of removing the gamma
from Sterns' blood,

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:47.660
he upped the dose.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:51.600
Made Sterns his own
personal think tank,

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.520
creating technology
and weapons for the state.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.600
Holy shit.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.640
Why did Sterns
go along with it?

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.560
Camp Echo One was the stick.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.520
I imagine
a pardon was the carrot.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:11.560
Ross told Sterns he'd let him
go once he became president.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.680
And yet, here we are.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.620
So Sterns hired you
to steal Japan's adamantium

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.660
knowing it would divide
the two countries.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.680
He paid us
through a CIA black fund.

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:29.610
That could kill the treaty
and start a war.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.570
And Ross would be blamed
for the chaos.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.540
How do you think a man
with Ross' temperament

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.580
will deal with being caught
in a trap?

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.530
If you break out of Allenwood,
I'll find you.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:46.520
When I break out, Captain,

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.600
you won't walk away alive.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.680
-Did you know?
-Of course not.

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.470
But Ross is not
that man anymore.

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:56.560
None of us have to be
defined by our past.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.490
Cap, my guy needs 24 hours
on the pills.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.580
Okay. We need to get to DC

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.560
and tell Ross
what Sterns is planning.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.660
President Ross isn't in DC.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:05.670
He's on the USS Milius.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.630
They just moved
into the Indian Ocean.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:09.640
Japan's warships are also
in proximity.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.480
Shit. Suit up.
We need to move.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.450
May I help you?

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:21.520
Hello, Admiral.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.470
May I use your phone?

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:25.450
Hey, honey.
Who's at the door?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.500
Holy shit.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:32.670
You ever see
anything like this?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.500
No, I haven't.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.480
Let me do the talking
or he'll never listen.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.550
I haven't seen Ross like this
since the army.

01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:06.590
He better snap out of it.

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:09.600
Because whatever Sterns is
planning, it's happening soon.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.640
I want a fleet of F-18s
ready to catapult.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.440
If they turn that ship around,
I want...

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.440
What's he doing here?

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.440
I told you not
to get involved, Wilson.

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.520
I brought him, sir.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.540
I want him outta here!

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.590
Sir, you asked me
to run this investigation,

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.590
-and the situation is--
-Don't bother with excuses.

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.450
You had a simple job
and you failed.

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.470
Mr. President,

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.600
we've uncovered intel
at Camp Echo One

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.500
that could put millions
of lives at risk.

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:40.540
Now, you and I both know
Isaiah's innocent.

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.480
I'm happy to have
this conversation in public,

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.500
if you like.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.480
This is crazy.
Japan's supposed to be our--

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.550
Jackal?

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:58.620
Jackal, do you copy?

01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:05.650
Make it quick, Wilson.

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.580
I've got Japan's fleet
on my ass

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.580
trying to make it to
that island before we do.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.440
That's exactly what he wants.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.440
Sterns has been pulling
the strings on everything.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.670
SERPENT's theft
of the adamantium,

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.570
the attack on the White House.

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:21.520
The CIA leak to Japan.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.530
He's pitting you and Japan
against each other

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:26.530
to ensure that
this moment happens.

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:28.580
How the hell did he do
all that from prison?

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.610
Mind control.
He created a technology

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:33.520
that allowed him
to control the minds

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.650
of anyone he targeted.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:36.640
Including maybe you, sir.

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.640
Have you been feelin'
like yourself lately?

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:52.620
Of course I have.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.630
But he has
your data, sir. Why?

01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:55.660
I don't know.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.480
If he can control minds,
surely he can hack files.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.520
The logs show that you visited
Camp Echo One numerous times.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.650
To ensure a high-value
prisoner was secure.

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:09.490
Yeah, but the scans, the EKG,

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.470
the blood work
was all taken there, sir.

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:12.500
This is ridiculous.

01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.440
Mr. President,
answer the question.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.480
I don't have to answer you!

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.540
Why visit a Black Site,

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.490
-in the middle of nowhere...
-Wilson, stop!

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.570
I order you to stop!

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.470
-...to conduct these tests?
-I order you to stop!

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.560
-Why?
-Because I was dying,

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.620
goddamn it!

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.680
Because my heart was failing!

01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:37.460
No one could figure it out
until he did.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.470
These things
have kept me alive.

01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:49.470
And in return, I gave him hope

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:51.460
that he might get
his life back.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.580
He got a lab to do the work.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.550
I even tried
to get him moved but--

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.490
But you couldn't risk
losing the pills.

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.660
After your friend the Hulk
and the Abomination

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.650
destroyed Harlem,
someone had to take the fall.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.600
Sterns was just...

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:17.530
collateral damage.

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:23.540
I have dedicated
my entire life

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.470
to serving this country.

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:32.470
The one person that matters...

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.650
doesn't seem to understand.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:43.540
Betty never forgave me for
sending the army after Banner.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.450
I had to survive...

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.550
...so that my daughter knew

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:57.660
that there was more
to her father.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.670
That I'm the same man
that used to take her

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.610
to see the cherry blossoms.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.550
She still can, sir.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.560
I know what it's like...

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:15.440
to feel you have
somethin' to prove.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.590
Everyone only seeing
one thing.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.590
But when showing
there's more to you,

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.600
it's not about
when times are easy.

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.680
It's about moments like this.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.460
Now, we're here
because Sterns wants revenge

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.570
and doesn't care
if he incites a war.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.660
We're playing right
into his hand.

01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:41.550
Mr. President,
two of our F-18s

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:43.630
just fired
on the Japanese fleet.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:48.610
Keep hailing those pilots.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.450
Damage
to Japanese fleet minimal.

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:54.520
Ready air defense systems.

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.540
What the hell
are those pilots doing?

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
Call them back in.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.580
We tried, sir.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.460
Jackal and Whiskey
won't respond.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.470
We gotta get our birds
in the air.

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.490
You have two ready
to fly now, sir.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:06.650
Go.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.520
Sterns got to our pilots

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.610
before I shut down the system.

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:27.630
We need to get the Japanese
out of the air.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.500
Stay close
and don't get yourself killed.

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:31.670
No dying, copy that.

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:39.640
Return to your fleet.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.660
Jackal's headed towards
the Japanese fleet.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.440
Shit! He just fired on them.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.470
Mr. President,
do not send more fighters up.

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:08.600
We need Japan to see
we're trying to deescalate.

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.610
Sir,
six Japanese missiles inbound.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.680
Launch intercept missiles.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.550
Damn, two got through.

01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:45.670
Take the one on the right.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.660
Redwing, a little help.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.490
Sir, you need to convince
Japan to ground their planes.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.440
This is what we expected

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.440
from a Ross presidency.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.640
Mr. Prime Minister, two
of our pilots have gone rogue.

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.470
Call off your planes.
We're being manipulated.

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:30.450
Certainly.

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:31.550
By you.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.660
Hiding your assassins
behind Captain America.

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.580
He's trying
to bring them down now, sir.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.600
If those pilots are not
taking orders from you,

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.450
then who gives them
their commands?

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.660
That's what I thought.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:53.640
Mr. President?

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.530
Ah,
now we're getting somewhere.

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:05.440
That fire in the belly.
The rage.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.460
Why don't you just let it out?

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.560
Are you all right, sir?

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.610
I just need a moment.

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.550
Joaquin,
Whiskey's coming at you.

01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:21.680
Copy that.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.520
Sam, once we're done,
you gotta teach me your moves!

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:41.490
Altitude. Altitude.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.650
Altitude.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.670
Whiskey's away.
Send rescue.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.550
Roger, sending rescue.

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.550
You have two Japanese fighters
coming up on your tail.

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.540
Why the hell
are they still chasing us?

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560
We're trying to help them.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.480
Because Ross won't tell
them who's really behind this.

01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:05.470
All that hatred
you try to hide,

01:16:05.610 --> 01:16:09.570
all the ugliness,
it's still there, Ross,

01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:12.640
smoldering behind the eyes.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.560
Joaquin,
I'm goin' after Jackal.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.550
Roger that.
I'll keep these guys busy.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.600
What have you done to me,
you bastard?

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:46.470
What we agreed on.
Maybe a hair more.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.630
You poisoned me!

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:49.670
Stop taking the pills then.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.490
But we both know you won't.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.500
Give me what I want.
Stop fighting it.

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.600
No!

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.590
Sam, Jackal
just fired his last missiles!

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.600
I got one.
Going after the another.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.660
- Back off! I'll get it!
- No, no! I got it.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.500
-Back off!
-I got it.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.660
Joaquin!

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.550
Joaquin's down!
I'm goin' after him.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:56.620
We'll send search and rescue.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.560
You have to stop Jackal.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:59.600
Damn it!

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.680
I'm putting an end
to this now.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.670
Give in to your rage.

01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:07.660
I'm taking your legacy
as we speak.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.550
Come on, Ross.
You're almost there.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.590
You can rip their fleet apart
with your bare hands,

01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:17.500
and kill Captain America.

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:23.620
Oh, shit.

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:32.670
Let the monster
inside you out.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.560
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.610
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.500
Unleash your anger.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:51.450
Unleash your hatred.

01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:52.590
Redwing, stabilize!

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.520
Nothing can stop you, Ross.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.460
You can crush them all.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.530
Mr. President?

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:22.520
Sir. Are you okay?

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.650
Captain America neutralized
the rogue pilots.

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.670
Japan's recalling
their planes.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.580
Get Ozaki back on the line.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.480
We can fix this.

01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:51.520
Where's Joaquin?

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.440
Med-evac just got to him.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.550
Thank God.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.600
A crisis was narrowly avoided

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.530
when a brief dogfight
broke out

01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:08.580
between Japanese
and US military forces

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.560
over Celestial Island.

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.570
US Air Force Lieutenant
Joaquin Torres

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.570
was shot down
during the skirmish,

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:15.640
and is now in surgery at

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.560
Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.580
His condition is critical.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.650
Here, give me that clamp.

01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:23.460
Gonna need to pack this!

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600
The pressure's stable.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.440
Suction!

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:29.520
I can't see anything.
More suction.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.480
Retractors.

01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:37.590
It's a private room.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.680
Go away.

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:48.480
I missed you, too.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:59.600
I hate to admit it,
I'm glad you're here.

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:09.440
You looked good out there
on that six o'clock.

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:11.520
But then I saw this.

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:14.620
The doctors had to
restart his heart.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.440
They don't know if...

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.550
This isn't your fault.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.570
It makes me think of Steve.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.670
How many alien invasions
did he stop again?

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:31.490
Two.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.500
Two.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:35.480
Wow.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.660
What made me think
I could follow that?

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:47.480
I should've took the serum.
Like Steve, like you.

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:49.650
Why?

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.550
Because this is all startin'
to seem much bigger than me.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.480
Ross, he asked me
to restart the Avengers, Buck.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.440
But Joaquin's in here,

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.460
Isaiah's in prison,
and Sterns...

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.500
I had him. I had Sterns
right in my hands.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:15.600
And he got away.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.580
He damn near pushed us
to the brink of war,

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.440
because I wasn't...

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.680
Say what you need to say.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.590
Steve made a mistake.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.490
No, he didn't.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.470
He gave you that shield

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.440
not because
you're the strongest,

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.540
but because you're you.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.580
You think
if you had that serum

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.450
you'd be able to protect
all the people you care about.

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.440
Steve had it, and he couldn't.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.580
You're a human being,
and you're doing your best.

01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:58.600
Steve gave people
something to believe in.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:22:59.620
But you...

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.440
you give 'em
something to aspire to.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.640
Did your speechwriters
help you with that?

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.550
They did, yeah.
The ending, a little bit.

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:11.550
Well, did you like it?

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.600
No, no, it was good.
Solid B-plus.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.680
-Emotional.
-Yeah, very. I felt it.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.480
But just enough.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.470
Yeah.

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.640
Listen, I gotta catch a plane.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.570
I have a campaign fundraiser.
It's so stupid.

01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:31.440
It's gonna be all right, man.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.520
Thanks, Buck.

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.480
I love you, buddy.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.500
-Was that...
-Yep.

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:56.500
Future Congressman
James Buchanan Barnes.

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.500
He's taller in real life,
nice smile too,

01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:05.660
good amount of teeth,
great posture.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.640
He's 110 years old.

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:09.520
I can work with that.

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.610
While the investigation

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:12.640
into the White House
assassination attempt

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:14.500
and the shocking shooting at

01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:17.500
Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling
is still under way,

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.560
Isaiah Bradley is set to go

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.610
before a military judge
tomorrow.

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:21.640
I need some air.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.520
It's a stunning
fall from grace for a man

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.480
brought out from the shadows
by Captain America.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.570
Just two years after
being exonerated

01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:30.650
for unjust charges,

01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:34.470
Bradley now finds himself
held in solitary confinement

01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:37.550
and facing a possible
death sentence.

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:51.560
Okay, reset.
Let's go again.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.590
Talk to me.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.530
Dunphy,
you check out my report?

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:57.570
All right,
what am I looking at?

01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:59.500
Those pills you gave me,

01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:00.580
they're loaded
with gamma radiation,

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.620
engineered to be
absorbed into the blood.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.520
Where the hell
did you get these?

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.470
Shit. I gotta make a call.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.650
This sound is currently
affecting your equilibrium.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.460
When I turn this dial,

01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:22.640
it will disrupt
your heartbeat.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.460
I take no pleasure
in your death,

01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:28.650
but I can't have you
calling the Captain.

01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:31.600
Who are you?

01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:34.550
Isn't it obvious?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.650
I'm the hero.

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:00.530
Sir.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.630
Agent Taylor.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520
Just wanted to let you know

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.580
that every guest
has been screened,

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.600
and we also did three sweeps
of the Rose Garden.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480
Thank you.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:12.630
-See you out there.
-Yes, sir.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.500
Hello?

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.560
Hello. Hi.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.560
I... how are you?

01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:44.490
I'm sorry,
I should have called

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.540
after the attack
at the White House.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.640
Are you okay?

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.660
Oh...

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:50.620
I'm fine.

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.530
It's really good
to hear your voice.

01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.440
I didn't think you'd answer.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.640
Betty, I... I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.590
But I'm trying to change,
to be a better person.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440
Um...

01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:17.580
Maybe we could take a...
a walk sometime?

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:23.560
See the cherry blossoms,
like the old days.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.630
Yeah. That could be nice.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.460
Okay. I love you.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.470
Bye, Dad.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.620
Please.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.490
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:07.450
When I took office,

01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:12.540
I promised we would create
a true, lasting peace.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.600
Today, we begin
to realize that promise.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.620
Captain America...

01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:24.680
would you do me the kindness

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:29.520
of counseling a bitter man
at the end of his rope?

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.460
That's what you do, isn't it?

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.580
Guess we have five minutes

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.610
until the MPs drag your ass
outta here.

01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:39.480
You ruined my grand finale
on the Indian Ocean.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.500
So now I'm forced
to turn myself in

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:42.530
to get what I want.

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.610
Well, if you're waitin'
for an apology,

01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:46.440
we'll be here awhile.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.660
I'm waiting for you to realize

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.680
that we both want
the same thing,

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.640
for the world to see Ross
as he truly is.

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:58.450
I'm proud to say our treaty
will finally be signed.

01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.490
I'll take a couple questions.

01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:02.480
Sir, what do you say
to reports

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.680
that relations with Japan
broke down

01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:05.440
over your handling

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.630
of the White House
assassination attempt?

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:09.600
Despite fabrications
that some have used

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.560
to turn us against each other,

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.590
our bonds have proved strong.

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:17.440
You kept Ross alive for years.

01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:20.580
Didn't kill him when you had
the chance at the White House.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.520
The way I see it,

01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:27.590
the Indian Ocean
wasn't about starting a war.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.640
You wanted to
destroy his legacy.

01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:33.440
Yes.

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.520
But you haven't
figured out how.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:37.670
The pills.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.550
I got somebody on that, too.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.610
Not anymore, you don't.

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.590
Is it true hostilities
in the Indian Ocean

01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:46.590
occurred because
the Japanese discovered

01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:48.490
it was, in fact,
your government

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.470
who paid for the SERPENT
mercenary group

01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:51.640
to steal their adamantium?

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.540
We did not pay them.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.530
Ross turned me into a monster.

01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:59.600
It's only right that I do
the same thing to him.

01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:01.670
Why aren't you smiling?

01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:04.520
-On the ground!
-Hold it!

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.500
You ever use
that big brain of yours

01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.530
to consider that maybe
you're wrong about Ross?

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:15.660
Wanna bet?

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.650
Yeah.

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.530
-Where are you going?
-To stop this.

01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:22.670
Get on the ground, now.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.620
You have the right
to remain silent...

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.680
Captain America!

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:31.560
If I'm right about Ross,
you're going to die.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.570
You're going to die!

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.480
Mr. President,
Dr. Samuel Sterns

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.640
just turned himself in.

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.540
He claims you
promised him a pardon

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.480
if he worked on secret
government projects for you.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.520
That is a lie.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.660
President Ross,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.680
I miss our little visits.

01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:50.610
What do you want?

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:52.480
I wanted my life back,

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.580
but it's too late
for that now.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.610
Sir...

01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:56.440
I helped you
more than anyone.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.560
Well, let me explain.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.620
They have to know.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.580
You gotta
understand my position.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.480
Oh, I do.
You let me rot in this prison.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:05.610
Leave me alone!

01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:07.580
- Leave me! Let me go!
- Sir! Sir!

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.680
I cannot let you.

01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:11.450
-You can't let me? Let me?
-I cannot...

01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:14.660
Everyone will know
just who you are.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.490
And Betty will despise you
even more.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.680
Sir, please.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.630
Sir.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.640
Oh, my God.

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.540
Since when were they red?

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.450
President Ross?

01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:11.630
Agent Taylor, do we fire?

01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:49.660
This is what Sterns wanted.

01:32:59.650 --> 01:33:00.660
Jesus.

01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.570
Sam, I gotta get these people
outta here.

01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:09.630
Set a perimeter
around the White House.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:39.590
No.

01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:41.530
Fall back. Fall back!

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:49.480
Get down!

01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:53.490
Sam, drones incoming.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.470
Ruth, I need you to
clear Hains Point.

01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:41.610
I'll lure Ross there.

01:34:41.630 --> 01:34:43.680
Sam, are you crazy?
He'll kill you.

01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:45.480
Do it!

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.550
You can still fight this,
Ross.

01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:46.450
Do you see where you are?

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.460
You remember this place?

01:35:51.490 --> 01:35:53.460
You used to come here
with Betty.

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:57.570
That didn't work.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.520
Okay.

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:08.560
You want me?

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.470
Come and get me!

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.630
Sam?
Sam, can you hear me?

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.640
Sam, are you okay?

01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:13.440
Please tell me I knocked
that son of a bitch out.

01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:20.670
Shit.

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:28.480
Backup's five minutes away.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500
No, tell them wait.

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:31.600
What?

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.640
Should've taken that serum.

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:44.620
Bucky is full of shit.

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.580
I'm gonna lose that bet.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.650
Ross.

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:01.640
We both know you can
take me out with one punch,

01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:04.480
but I don't think
you wanna do that.

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.670
I know you've done
some terrible things.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.460
Now, I might be crazy...

01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:21.590
but I think you're
trying to change.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.600
Now's the time to prove it
to the world.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.440
Prove it to Betty.

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:25.440
The army is transferring
Sterns to a secure facility.

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.670
We should get you
to the hospital.

01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:31.450
There's somewhere
we gotta go first.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.670
That's three, old man.

01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:48.560
I told you I'd get you out.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.620
Took you so long?

01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:56.500
Thank you, Sam.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.470
I got you.

01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:00.440
I have a few broken bones,
so...

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:05.450
Come on, Mr. Bradley.

01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.460
We got a little paperwork
to fill out,

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.440
and then you're free to go.

01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:17.460
Worldwide talks continue

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:20.490
in the arms race
for the new element

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.580
as we enter the
brave new world of adamantium.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.660
Back in our nation's capital,
ground was broken

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.440
on the restoration
of the White House,

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:30.600
marking a significant step
towards normalcy

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:31.590
for the country.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.500
Right this way.

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:03.480
Mr. President.
How're your digs?

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.640
Intentionally uncomfortable.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.530
I heard the food
hasn't got any better either.

01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:18.520
You heard right.

01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:20.530
Bradley got out?

01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:21.520
Yes, sir.

01:42:21.630 --> 01:42:22.660
That's good.

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.540
Mr. President,
about your blood work.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.670
It seems Sterns raised
the level of gamma

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.670
in those pills over time.

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.570
It built up in your body
over the years.

01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:33.550
That led to your...

01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:35.460
Led to my little tantrum.

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600
Which is why I have to be
in here.

01:42:39.650 --> 01:42:41.670
Good solid walls, these.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.460
Yeah.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:44.670
But I have to say,

01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:46.590
it wasn't nothin' to see you

01:42:46.610 --> 01:42:49.550
take full responsibility
for your actions.

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.450
Give up your office.
Accept your sentence.

01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:56.470
I had to let the country
move on.

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.590
Japan decided to uphold
the treaty, by the way.

01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:00.570
Us too.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.580
The Ozaki-Ross Accords.

01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:05.540
You did it.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.600
Sam, why are you here?

01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:09.630
Sir?

01:43:11.610 --> 01:43:13.570
We were on different sides
of this thing

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:14.660
every step of the way.

01:43:16.630 --> 01:43:18.600
Look, if we can't see
the good in each other,

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.550
we've already lost the fight.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:26.540
Besides, I wanted to make sure
an old soldier was okay.

01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:32.550
I'd love to stay, but looks
like you have another visitor.

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.640
Hi, Dad.

01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:50.450
I guess I have to give you
a raincheck on that walk.

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.600
It's all right.

01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:56.680
We could just sit and talk
for a little while.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.490
I'd like that.

01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.470
Me too.

01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:18.450
How's the kid doin' today?

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:21.480
He's still a little out of it
but doin' better.

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:23.610
I'm gonna let you two
catch up.

01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:25.680
Hey, where you headed?
Back to Baltimore?

01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:27.570
No.

01:44:28.530 --> 01:44:31.570
I got Ruth and me tickets
for tonight's game, courtside.

01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:34.490
It's the least I could do
for gettin' me out.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.650
You know,
I'm happy you found a friend

01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:37.650
as grumpy as you are
to go to games with.

01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:41.490
Say it again.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.470
I'm playing.
Got you.

01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:55.600
The Falcon awakens.

01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:58.630
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.550
I'm sorry I screwed up.

01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:08.530
Screwed up? Get out of here.

01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:09.590
I did.

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.580
You never messed up
like I have.

01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:14.600
You never got
shot out of the sky

01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.610
and nosedived into
the Indian Ocean.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.450
You're always on point.

01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:23.450
Yeah.

01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:26.680
Because if I'm not on point...

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.560
I feel like I let down

01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:35.520
everyone else who was fightin'
for a seat at that table.

01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.450
That's pressure, man.

01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:43.580
It weighs on you.

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.540
Makes you wonder
if you'll ever just be...

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.600
enough.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.440
Where I grew up,

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.600
I only ever got
to see heroes online.

01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:08.560
Or on TV.

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:11.600
It always felt so far away.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.540
And I kept thinkin' maybe
if I get out of Miami,

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.500
you know,
maybe one day I could be...

01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:20.440
Don't say Ant-Man.

01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:24.670
No, man.

01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:30.490
I wanted to be you.

01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:32.590
Well...

01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:34.440
Sam Wilson.

01:46:35.530 --> 01:46:39.540
Because that guy?
That guy won't ever give up.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.450
That pressure,
that responsibility

01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:44.480
you talk about?

01:46:44.650 --> 01:46:46.560
I want that too, man.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.620
You know it's all
about timin', right?

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.560
Control your spin, then hit
your thruster before you kick.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.470
- No.
- Yeah.

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:11.590
No. That's...

01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:13.480
That's it.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.670
I should get shot out
of the sky more often.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.520
Yeah, you will.

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.560
Okay.

01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:22.550
You know, you're gonna
come back from this.

01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:24.450
I know.

01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:29.630
And when that time comes,
make sure the suit's ready,

01:47:29.650 --> 01:47:31.670
'cause Ross was right
about one thing.

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:35.470
The world needs the Avengers.

01:47:35.490 --> 01:47:37.550
-For real?
-Yeah.

01:47:37.570 --> 01:47:39.450
Hell, yeah.

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.460
I wasn't thinking
about it before,

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.660
but now that
you bring it up...

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.640
Oh, boy.

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:46.540
...since the wings
are damaged,

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.440
I was thinking, I'm like,
what could make--

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:49.460
No.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.440
You didn't hear

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.440
-what I was gonna ask you.
-No. Whatever you ask, nope.

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.520
I'm just saying,
maybe you have, like,

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.650
the Wakandans on speed dial

01:47:55.670 --> 01:47:57.480
and could get me some...

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.660
A hookup on an upgrade
on the wings.

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.600
You're gonna ask the Wakandans
for a hookup?

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:05.590
Yeah.

01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:07.530
That is the most Miami thing
in the world.

01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:10.470
Are you kidding? They gonna
hook me up, man. Yo.

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.990
Told you you were gonna
lose that bet.

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.630
You wanna know what's funny?

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:04.550
I'm not in the mood
for your jokes.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.580
You killed a lot of good men
trying to get your revenge.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.540
Trust me, we don't share
the same sense of humor.

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:13.660
We share the same world,
don't we?

01:51:14.290 --> 01:51:16.390
This world you would
die to save?

01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:19.600
It's coming.

01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:22.500
I've seen it
in the probabilities,

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.500
seen it plain as day.

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.490
All you heroes
protecting this world...

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.040
do you think
you're the only ones?

01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:34.460
Do you think
this is the only world?

01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:37.530
We'll see what happens

01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:42.060
when you have to protect
this place from the others.
