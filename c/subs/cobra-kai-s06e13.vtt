00:14.014 --> 00:17.766
<i>The world's most elite
karate tournament is almost here.</i>

00:17.767 --> 00:19.351
<i>It's the Sekai Taikai.</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:23.022
<i>The best under-18 martial artists
from across the globe</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.816
<i>competing for the title of world champion.</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:29.528
<i>Samantha LaRusso of Miyagi-Do
versus Cobra Kai's Tory Nichols.</i>

00:29.529 --> 00:31.739
<i>Winner advances to the girls' final,</i>

00:31.740 --> 00:35.242
<i>where she'll face Iron Dragons' superstar
Zara Malik.</i>

00:35.243 --> 00:36.368
<i>On the boys' side,</i>

00:36.369 --> 00:40.414
<i>it's Miyagi-Do's Robby Keene
versus Iron Dragons' Axel Kovačević.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:42.250
<i>And it all starts today.</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.295
Hi, everyone, and welcome
to our live prefight coverage

00:46.296 --> 00:48.589
of the Sekai Taikai World Championship.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.258
I'm Kevin Burkhardt, joined by Ryan Clark.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.093
Ryan, I gotta tell you,
between the two of us,

00:53.094 --> 00:56.013
we've covered just about
every major sporting event there is,

00:56.014 --> 00:58.057
but karate, now that's new territory.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.060
Karate on the world stage?
What could be better?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.644
<i>And we have the best of the best</i>

01:02.645 --> 01:06.482
<i>when we talk about the three dojos
competing in today's finals...</i>

01:06.483 --> 01:08.108
Robby, you're famous.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.152
You feel good?

01:10.028 --> 01:13.822
Yeah. I mean, I'm a little nervous.
Last time I fought Axel didn't go well.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.866
Gonna be a lot more people
watching this one.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.495
Hey, forget about who's watching
and screw the cameras.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.537
Oh, shit, my interview. Turn it up.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.747
<i>What a story this is.</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:25.627
<i>Two high school rivals from 35 years ago
now teaching together.</i>

01:26.211 --> 01:28.045
- Watch.
- <i>Johnny, you lost a heartbreaker</i>

01:28.046 --> 01:30.380
<i>in this very arena 35 years ago.</i>

01:30.381 --> 01:31.924
<i>Gotta ask, what's it like to be back?</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:35.344
<i>Yeah, well, you know,
listen, uh, nobody likes to lose.</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:36.929
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:38.263
<i>Let's just say</i>

01:38.264 --> 01:40.057
<i>time heals old karate wounds.</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:41.683
- Wait, that's it?
- <i>Johnny's not...</i>

01:41.684 --> 01:44.437
I talked to that dude for an hour.
I rented a whole damn suit.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.730
Maybe they'll come back to you.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.483
<i>The tournament underdog
is Miyagi-Do,</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:53.028
<i>a dojo with a rich family history
going back 400 years</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:57.659
<i>and brought to the United States
by its previous sensei, Nariyoshi Miyagi.</i>

01:58.409 --> 02:01.161
<i>And it's proven to be
an effective tournament style,</i>

02:01.162 --> 02:04.414
<i>even though that's surprising
because, at its core tenet,</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:06.583
<i>Miyagi-Do is about defense only.</i>

02:06.584 --> 02:07.752
We did it, Chozen.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.463
We brought Miyagi-Do to the world.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.091
- It doesn't feel like I thought it would.
- Hmm.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.760
Miyagi and I were good friends.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.556
The most honorable man I ever knew.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.058
<i>We shared a student, actually.</i>

02:23.059 --> 02:26.270
He's just doing what he always
does. Trying to get under your skin.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.187
I know.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.814
<i>And what would you say</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:32.609
<i>to those concerned about your alleged
history of tournament cheating?</i>

02:32.610 --> 02:34.736
One of the ugly truths about our society

02:34.737 --> 02:37.823
is that people find joy
in coming after those on top.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.493
And that's exactly
what my Iron Dragons are.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.912
Undefeated and on top.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.707
<i>The Iron Dragons
are clearly the team to beat.</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:50.502
<i>Based in Hong Kong, led by former
three-time Sekai Taikai champion</i>

02:50.503 --> 02:54.298
<i>Feng Xiao,
better known simply as Sensei Wolf.</i>

02:54.299 --> 02:55.674
And they're phenomenal.

02:55.675 --> 03:00.345
And I love that their girls' captain
and social media darling, Zara Malik,

03:00.346 --> 03:02.598
<i>is such a great role model
for her young followers.</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:05.475
<i>She's a real advocate
for female empowerment.</i>

03:05.476 --> 03:08.145
Look, we all saw
my livestream get hijacked.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.022
<i>Zara's secret is she's a two-faced *****.</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:14.318
Honestly, it just breaks my heart
when women attack other women.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.736
<i>We can compete hard on the mat,</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:18.697
<i>but off of it,
we need to lift each other up</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:21.533
<i>and remember that,
no matter who walks away champion,</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:23.493
we're all winners.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.662
<i>That brings us to Cobra Kai.</i>

03:25.663 --> 03:28.040
Great name for a dojo, by the way.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.041
- Great name.
- Yeah.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.377
But this is the dojo
with the most question marks coming in.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.714
See, after the tragic death
of their star fighter, Kwon Jae-Sung,

03:35.715 --> 03:38.258
is it still possible for Cobra Kai to win?

03:38.259 --> 03:41.136
And their sensei,
Vietnam veteran John Kreese,

03:41.137 --> 03:43.972
he's ignored all
of our interview requests.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.350
And it got me wondering, is he gonna show?

03:46.351 --> 03:49.686
Is Cobra Kai gonna show?
Will we see them at all today?

03:49.687 --> 03:52.231
<i>We all eagerly await
the answer to that.</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:54.942
<i>So stay tuned, folks,
'cause it's almost karate time.</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
What the hell do you want?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.669
Uh, I won't take up much of your time.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.087
I just wanted to apologize.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.009
I failed you as a sensei
back in Barcelona.

04:21.469 --> 04:26.264
I treated you like you were some... soldier
in my own private war.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.687
I regret letting you down.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.066
I regret letting Kwon down.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.532
Is, uh... Is Yoon gonna fight?

04:43.533 --> 04:44.701
No one is.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.747
You're the last of the Cobra Kai.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.583
But you signed off on the tournament.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.877
So you could fight.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.673
So you could be the champion.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.136
I know you don't want me in your corner.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.224
But I have always loved
your guts and passion.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.728
Just know that I will always
be rooting for you.

05:16.065 --> 05:16.983
Goodbye, kid.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.489
Does it have to be?

05:25.658 --> 05:26.491
Goodbye?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.253
I'm afraid so.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.757
I have one last thing to do,

05:42.050 --> 05:43.760
and then it's time for me to

05:45.344 --> 05:46.428
step aside.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.946
The Sekai Taikai boasts
a rich and proud history.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.615
And if you are here,

06:06.616 --> 06:10.244
it's because you embody
all the Sekai Taikai stands for.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.998
Welcome, competitors, senseis,
sponsors, and esteemed guests

06:14.999 --> 06:16.917
to the San Fernando Valley

06:16.918 --> 06:20.379
for the conclusion
of the world's greatest karate tournament,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.715
the Sekai Taikai.

06:36.938 --> 06:37.897
Phew.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.898
Brings back some memories, huh?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.401
Yeah, good ones for you.
You won here.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.987
Hey, guys, go sign in. I'll grab the bags.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.572
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.617
Here we go.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.206
Need a hand?

06:55.998 --> 06:56.833
No...

06:57.333 --> 06:59.210
No more of that. I... I...

07:00.503 --> 07:02.171
I just came by to thank you...

07:04.173 --> 07:06.384
for what you did for me in Barcelona.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.053
Silver just got what he had coming to him.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.513
But when push comes to shove,
Johnny Lawrence

07:11.514 --> 07:13.141
always does the right thing.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.103
Well, now it's my turn.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.814
I don't want anything from you.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.024
I'm sorry that I ruined Cobra Kai.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.697
I was so proud of you
for bringing it back.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.575
Sure, it was different.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.286
But that's what it needed.

07:35.037 --> 07:38.416
For the last few months, I've been
thinking a lot about my failures.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.670
And my biggest failure
happened right here in this parking lot.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.921
<i>I said I did my best.</i>

07:44.922 --> 07:47.215
You're nothing. You lost. You're a loser.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.718
- You're the loser.
- Yeah?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.304
Now who's the loser, huh?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.932
When you lost to LaRusso back in '84...

07:57.185 --> 07:58.518
you handled it like a man.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.813
- Daniel!
- You're all right, LaRusso.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.483
And what I did next was inexcusable.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.151
<i>Come on, who's the loser now?</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:07.194
- You fuck!
- Come on.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.363
- Who's the loser? I don't hear ya!
- Come on!

08:09.864 --> 08:12.158
If it wasn't for me,
you would've kept going.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.869
You could have ended up
in the Sekai Taikai.

08:15.661 --> 08:20.874
Instead, I... left all that garbage
from my life on your doorstep

08:20.875 --> 08:23.669
and made you carry it for 35 years.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.883
I'm sorry for that, Johnny.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.390
I gotta go watch my son fight.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.232
It's my honor to introduce

08:45.233 --> 08:47.068
our guest referee,

08:47.568 --> 08:49.778
local hero

08:49.779 --> 08:54.366
and former All Valley champion,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.578
Darryl Vidal!

09:05.044 --> 09:07.629
- Thank you, Mr. Braun.
- You're welcome.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.257
Are you ready for the world's best karate?

09:15.471 --> 09:16.388
Whoo!

09:16.389 --> 09:17.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.766
Oh, wow. You really went all out, huh?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.643
Oh, well, it's the Sekai Taikai.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.022
It's like the Super Bowl, the World Cup,
and March Madness all under one roof.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.400
Yeah, Robby! Kick some ass! Yeah.

09:28.401 --> 09:33.196
The time has come. We have
two more semifinals to complete. Then...

09:33.197 --> 09:36.908
<i>Terrance, we thought it was gone,
but it's back.</i>

09:37.952 --> 09:38.868
<i>How long?</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:42.123
<i>Six months.</i>

09:53.009 --> 09:55.635
<i>Those sons of bitches
ruined my reputation.</i>

09:55.636 --> 09:59.514
<i>They took the one thing
left in the world I cared about.</i>

09:59.515 --> 10:02.560
<i>If I'm going to hell,
I'm taking them down with me.</i>

10:08.065 --> 10:10.483
Of the world's 16 best dojos,

10:10.484 --> 10:13.194
it's all come down to our final three.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.696
The Iron Dragons...

10:18.159 --> 10:20.327
...Miyagi-Do Karate...

10:20.328 --> 10:22.830
Yeah! Yeah!

10:24.373 --> 10:26.708
...and Cobra Kai.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.091
No Cobra Kai senseis.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.676
The rules are simple.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.762
Each dojo will retain the points

10:38.763 --> 10:41.932
they've earned
in their Barcelona competitions.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.271
Our unfinished boys' semifinal
will reset to zero-zero,

10:48.272 --> 10:53.151
and the remaining girls' semifinal
will be taking place tomorrow.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.195
Eyes on your opponent.

10:55.196 --> 10:59.032
Each match will consist
of three two-minute rounds

10:59.033 --> 11:00.826
with unlimited scoring.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.828
One point for a hit,

11:03.454 --> 11:04.704
ten for a knockdown,

11:04.705 --> 11:07.123
and 20 for a knockout.

11:07.124 --> 11:11.044
The finals will determine
our individual champions,

11:11.045 --> 11:15.507
and the dojo
with the most cumulative points

11:15.508 --> 11:18.677
will be crowned grand champion.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.011
Yeah.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.138
You got the extra cheese and jalapeños?

11:22.139 --> 11:24.432
- Now.
- I'm gonna pretend you didn't ask me that.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.310
Will everyone please stand

11:26.894 --> 11:29.229
and join me in a moment of silence

11:29.230 --> 11:33.192
for our fallen competitor, Kwon Jae-Sung.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.579
Penis Breath!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.501
Thank you.

11:51.752 --> 11:52.753
For our first match,

11:53.921 --> 11:56.590
or should I say rematch,

11:58.300 --> 12:03.722
Axel Kovačević versus Robby Keene.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.566
Robby.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.068
You can do this.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.070
Lock in. Trust your skills.

12:19.071 --> 12:23.199
It doesn't matter what happened last time,
how many people are watching.

12:23.200 --> 12:27.537
It's just you and him on the mat.
You trained for this. You're ready.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.549
They may have picked
the venue and the ref,

12:39.842 --> 12:41.844
but we have the most skilled fighters.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.597
We should win easily.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.727
If it gets any closer than that,

12:51.604 --> 12:52.730
you know what to do.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.275
You have nothing to worry about.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.739
Look at them.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.493
They're scared of you
'cause of what you done in Barcelona.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.334
Make him fear for his life.

13:18.964 --> 13:19.965
Yes, Sensei.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.513
- Come on, Robby!
- Robby!

13:26.263 --> 13:27.807
Robby, you can do it!

13:30.059 --> 13:32.185
Fighters, face me. Bow.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.229
Each other. Bow.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.817
Fighting stance.

13:40.110 --> 13:40.945
Ais!

13:41.987 --> 13:43.029
Fight.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.345
Point!

14:08.597 --> 14:09.514
- Yes!
- Yes!

14:09.515 --> 14:11.266
- Yes!
- That's it. That's it.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.268
Okay, yeah, maybe he can do this.

14:13.269 --> 14:17.313
Robby! Robby! Robby! Robby!

14:17.314 --> 14:20.275
Robby! Robby! Robby!

14:20.276 --> 14:23.152
Robby! Robby!

14:26.365 --> 14:28.533
What... what stance is that?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.375
Point. Point.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.918
Two points.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.006
Dude, he's using moves
we've never seen before.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.015
Point.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.058
Point.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.436
We did not program that.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.356
No point. Block.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.785
No point. Block.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.043
Point.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.646
Why are you smiling?

15:39.355 --> 15:40.230
I--

15:40.981 --> 15:42.899
You let yourself get hit.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.234
Do you want to get hit?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.153
No, Sensei.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.155
He's a machine.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.490
It's like he reprogrammed himself.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.575
He adapted.

15:52.117 --> 15:52.952
Now you adapt.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.578
I don't know if I can.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.830
Robby Keene not knowing how to adapt?

15:57.831 --> 15:59.291
That's a first.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.835
You've never had things easy, Robby.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.880
You've been knocked down every which way
more times than anyone I've ever known.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.634
But you've also gotten back up
more times too.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.887
You stood up to Kreese. To Silver.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.597
Whenever you knew something was wrong,
you stood up.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.808
Even when you had to do it alone.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.185
You turned your rival
into your best friend.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.312
You patched things up with your dad.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.274
No one has adapted more than you.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.694
So tell me.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.196
Can you do it again?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.415
Damn good speech, LaRusso.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, let's just hope it's not too late.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.595
Fight!

16:56.640 --> 16:57.850
No point. Block.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.654
Point.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.909
Point.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.166
Ais!

17:23.333 --> 17:24.376
Point.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.502
No point. Block.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.175
- Point.
- Yes!

17:32.176 --> 17:33.260
Oh yeah!

17:41.643 --> 17:42.644
Come on.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.439
Point.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.067
Point.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.487
No point. Block.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.696
Point, Keene.

17:56.950 --> 17:57.785
Point.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.786
Yeah!

18:11.298 --> 18:12.173
Point.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.520
Ais!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.271
Ais!

18:27.189 --> 18:28.273
Point, Keene.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.245
That's what I'm talking...
That's what I'm talking about!

18:42.246 --> 18:44.163
Yeah! Oh, you see that? Yeah!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.920
That's great. You got five points.

18:51.839 --> 18:52.922
Yeah, but so did he.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.135
Yeah. So what? Now you see
he's not a machine. He's human.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.846
But if you wanna catch up,
you have to get a knockdown.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.555
Oi.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.056
Knock him on his ass.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.725
- Yeah!
- Here we go!

19:04.560 --> 19:06.519
He's adjusted. He's small but fast.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.022
Don't make excuses. That was pathetic.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.827
Are you sure?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.079
Do as I say,

19:25.247 --> 19:26.247
and you'll win.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.641
This is it, gentlemen. Final round.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.812
Fight!

20:04.786 --> 20:06.830
- What happened?
- Hey!

20:13.086 --> 20:15.129
- What's wrong?
- My knee!

20:15.130 --> 20:16.173
- My knee.
- Medic.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.090
Medic.

20:18.091 --> 20:22.179
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Hey! You did it on purpose!

20:22.679 --> 20:24.680
Please remain calm.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.395
Hey, shouldn't that be a disqualification?

20:31.396 --> 20:34.941
From what I saw, they both got tangled up,
and they both hit the mat.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.651
- I mean--
- So no points scored.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.569
He...

20:43.408 --> 20:45.494
We're gonna get you
on your feet. Ready?

20:45.994 --> 20:47.119
Put your weight on us.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.583
Robby Keene has 15 minutes
to return to the mat.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.044
If Keene is unable to return,

20:55.045 --> 20:57.631
Axel Kovačević will be awarded the win.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.890
I'll let the judges know.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.226
You did well out there, young man.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.692
Damn it.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.527
Just like that.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.696
Ch-- Chozen, do you know how to...?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.241
Heat massage not magic, Daniel-san.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.034
Broken bone needs time to heal.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.913
I just can't believe
Silver's gonna get away with this.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.208
Hey, you were awesome.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.002
I'm so proud of you.

21:36.003 --> 21:36.962
Thanks, Mom.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.302
Do you guys mind
if I can have a minute to myself?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.846
Take all the time you need, Robby-san.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.565
That asshole cheated.
I'm gonna murder him and his entire team.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.900
Just worry about winning your fight.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.448
I'm sorry, Robby.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.835
You gonna be all right?

22:19.421 --> 22:20.422
I could have won.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.176
It just sucks
the world will never know that.

22:30.015 --> 22:30.849
But I do.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.185
I did my best.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.520
I fought with honor.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.277
If that lands me in second place,
there's worse places to be.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.447
You're taking this
way better than I ever could.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.618
I guess instead of focusing
on the things that I lost, I just...

22:51.286 --> 22:53.412
I wanna focus on the things that I've won.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.378
Karate's given me
all the best things in my life.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.508
I mean, it's given me my friends.
It's given me my girlfriend.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.428
It's given me my dad.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.937
I'd say that makes you a winner
in anybody's eyes.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.774
Especially mine.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.621
I love you, man.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.207
I love you too.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.835
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.

23:41.711 --> 23:46.258
As Robby Keene cannot continue,
Axel Kovačević moves on to the finals.

23:46.758 --> 23:50.177
And if Cobra Kai does not name
a replacement for Kwon Jae-Sung,

23:50.178 --> 23:53.222
Axel Kovačević will be named
the boys' champion

23:53.223 --> 23:57.685
following the conclusion
of tomorrow's girls' semifinal round.

24:00.397 --> 24:03.899
I hate to be the bearer of math news,
but that fight just set us way back.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.235
Sam would have to score
multiple knockdowns,

24:06.236 --> 24:08.946
and the Iron Dragons
would have to stop scoring altogether.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.615
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
They've been scoring nonstop.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.493
We gotta face the facts. We lost.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.971
Looking Jersey tough.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.765
Mom said you were back here.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.810
Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sleep.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.396
Yeah, I know the feeling.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.941
It doesn't matter if I win tomorrow, Dad.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.819
There's no way I'm gonna make up
enough points to catch the Iron Dragons.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.573
And if I'm not fighting
for Miyagi-Do, then

24:52.657 --> 24:54.075
what am I even fighting for?

24:54.618 --> 24:56.912
A few months ago,
I thought it was for closure.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.788
In Barcelona, it became about
fighting our enemies again.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.584
But now... I'm supposed to fight Tory?

25:03.835 --> 25:06.546
And she has so much more
riding on this than I do, and...

25:07.255 --> 25:08.340
I don't know, I just...

25:11.301 --> 25:13.887
I guess I'm just having a hard time
finding my focus.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.389
I know that feeling too.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.732
For a while now,
I've been pretty off-balance.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.567
I thought restarting the tournament here

25:28.568 --> 25:31.363
would help us close the book
on all this the right way.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.908
But after what happened to Robby,
I... I just don't know.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
I wish I had the answers for you, kiddo,

25:38.870 --> 25:41.705
but I'm still searching
for some of those myself.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.184
Maybe you know how to win this,
Mr. Miyagi.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.061
Just tell me what to do.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.129
There's gotta be a way.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.090
<i>Danny, Danny, Danny,
you're getting in that ring.</i>

26:33.091 --> 26:35.884
<i>It's open season.
On him. And you.</i>

26:35.885 --> 26:38.637
<i>What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress ya?</i>

26:38.638 --> 26:40.514
<i>I'm talking to you, punk.</i>

26:40.515 --> 26:42.933
<i>You couldn't leave
well enough alone.</i>

26:42.934 --> 26:45.477
<i>God, you had to push it.
Well, now you're gonna pay.</i>

26:45.478 --> 26:47.271
<i>Get him a body bag!</i>

26:47.272 --> 26:48.939
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

26:52.569 --> 26:55.571
<i>We do not train to be merciful
here. Mercy is for the weak.</i>

26:55.572 --> 27:00.492
<i>Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.</i>

27:00.493 --> 27:02.786
- <i>The enemy deserves no mercy.</i>
- <i>Right!</i>

27:02.787 --> 27:04.538
- <i>Right!</i>
- <i>Right!</i>

27:17.594 --> 27:18.719
Mr. Miyagi?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.815
<i>Jump. Block. Get him!</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:38.365
Look out!

28:14.359 --> 28:15.443
Daniel-san,

28:16.361 --> 28:17.320
it's okay.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.324
Why didn't you tell me
you fought in the Sekai Taikai?

28:23.201 --> 28:24.577
That you killed someone?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.038
Why did you leave me all alone?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.541
Without any answers?

28:31.584 --> 28:35.296
I've been fighting so hard, Mr. Miyagi,
trying to do what you would do.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.006
But we can't win.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.342
We can't.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.261
We can't win.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.263
Daniel-san.

28:46.099 --> 28:49.477
Answer same place as always.

28:50.812 --> 28:55.066
Remember, Miyagi teach
win, lose, no matter.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.736
No need to fight anymore.

29:08.663 --> 29:11.124
You're up early.
Ready for your big day?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.132
I, um...

29:20.258 --> 29:22.010
I have something that I wanna tell you.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.597
But I don't want you to be disappointed.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.641
You're not fighting today.

29:32.812 --> 29:33.730
Samantha,

29:34.564 --> 29:35.940
I'm not disappointed.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.611
But I just told you I'm giving up.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.909
When I asked Mr. Miyagi to train me,

29:46.701 --> 29:48.244
I thought it was to fight.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.665
Then I learned maybe the most important
lesson he ever taught me.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.294
I was training
so I wouldn't have to fight.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.422
You're not giving up.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.592
You figured out something
that I forget too often.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.512
The greatest victory
karate can bring to you

30:06.387 --> 30:08.598
is not having to fight at all.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.896
I'm so proud of you.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.189
<i>I get Robby, but you and Sam?</i>

30:17.190 --> 30:19.775
Why are all the original Miyagi-Dos
okay with not fighting?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.735
What happened to Robby wasn't an accident.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.737
We're just gonna walk away, let them win?

30:23.738 --> 30:26.698
Believe me, I hate
the thought of that, too, Johnny.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.034
Then what is it?

30:28.618 --> 30:32.580
I entered this tournament to share
Mr. Miyagi's teachings with the world.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.751
That's why I was so upset
when I learned about his past.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.962
But then I realized

30:40.672 --> 30:41.840
none of that matters.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.634
Teachers may seem all-knowing, okay?

30:45.635 --> 30:48.512
But they are just human beings
like the rest of us.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.014
They may have their flaws
and their failures,

30:51.015 --> 30:54.893
but it's not on us to carry that.

30:54.894 --> 30:58.021
Our responsibility is to take
the good lessons that we're taught

30:58.022 --> 30:59.357
and pass those along.

31:00.149 --> 31:03.903
So the fact that Sam
and Robby are okay not fighting

31:04.612 --> 31:06.990
means that Mr. Miyagi's legacy
will live on,

31:07.949 --> 31:09.200
whether we win or lose.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.452
I get that.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.163
And that's great for you. I mean it.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.377
But I don't know how to not fight.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.256
And winning this thing was my last shot.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.181
I'll be right back.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.945
What the hell was that yesterday?

31:47.947 --> 31:49.908
Bringing up all this stuff from the past.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.286
What, you expect me to forgive you?

31:54.704 --> 31:57.832
- I don't deserve forgiveness.
- Yeah, we agree on that.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.043
I'll never forgive you for what you did.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.343
I loved you, man.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.680
Idolized you.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.644
Every good thing about myself... Strength.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.771
Confidence. Karate.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.521
...you taught me.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.485
I only wanted to please you.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.322
So, yeah, that night in the parking lot,

32:30.323 --> 32:34.242
December 19, 1984,
was the single worst moment of my life.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.374
But what hurt even more
than being choked out

32:39.874 --> 32:41.167
was you abandoning me.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.840
You threw me away like trash

32:49.217 --> 32:50.927
right when I needed you most.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.223
You have no idea

32:55.890 --> 32:57.517
what those years were like.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.478
I trusted no one!

33:05.316 --> 33:06.734
Least of all myself!

33:09.237 --> 33:10.904
All because of you!

33:43.938 --> 33:46.357
I'm so sorry, son.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.946
I can't... can't change the past.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.369
I wish there was some way I could...

34:00.705 --> 34:02.040
I could make it up to you.

34:12.008 --> 34:12.925
Maybe there is.

34:14.635 --> 34:18.056
The Sekai Taikai
has always been unpredictable,

34:18.639 --> 34:21.683
but this year has been like no other.

34:21.684 --> 34:26.104
Samantha LaRusso has elected not to fight,

34:26.105 --> 34:31.818
officially ending Miyagi-Do Karate's
impressive underdog run.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.071
Let's give them a round of applause!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.742
Do I still get to fight Nichols?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.036
Either way, we've still won.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.164
This now concludes our semifinal matches.

34:44.165 --> 34:48.835
Cobra Kai not naming a replacement
for their fallen captain

34:48.836 --> 34:50.837
means that Axel Kovačević

34:50.838 --> 34:54.926
automatically becomes
our new male champion.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.558
However,

35:03.142 --> 35:05.561
Cobra Kai has named a replacement.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.940
Joining Tory Nichols on Team Cobra Kai

35:09.941 --> 35:11.149
will be

35:11.150 --> 35:14.402
Miguel Diaz!
