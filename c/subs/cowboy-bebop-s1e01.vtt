20:09.124 --> 20:10.709
I'm only seeing one here.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.961
Thought you were working
a case on Ganymede.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.839
Well, my plans changed
when I heard you were coming in.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.010
Good haul?

20:20.636 --> 20:24.473
Ah, pocket change for hauling
in an anal fissure.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.141
Piece of shit, cowboy.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.352
[screams]

20:29.061 --> 20:30.062
[groans]

20:30.145 --> 20:31.355
One that walks with a limp.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.065
[chuckles] That's pretty funny.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.654
I'd say
it's good to see you again, Chalmers,

20:39.446 --> 20:40.405
but it wasn't.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.074
Yeah.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.410
Ah, shit.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.996
Hey, Jet! Hold up.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.797
Listen, there's a bounty coming up.

20:57.547 --> 21:01.718
It's not on the wire yet.
Some asshole shot up a bar on TJ.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.636
Yeah?

21:03.178 --> 21:04.388
Why are you giving it to me?

21:05.889 --> 21:09.351
Personally, I wouldn't cross the street
to piss on you if you were on fire,

21:09.434 --> 21:13.438
but your ex-wife asked me to throw you
a bone every now and again, so…

21:14.356 --> 21:16.441
While you were throwing her
your own bone, I bet.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.862
[sighs] Take it or leave it, pal.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.407
I could give a shit.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.370
[sighs]

21:34.543 --> 21:35.627
[saxophone music playing]

21:46.972 --> 21:49.224
[grunting]

22:08.869 --> 22:10.078
[motor starts]

22:15.000 --> 22:15.834
[Spike sighs]

22:17.711 --> 22:19.296
-A hundred thousand?
-Yeah.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.341
Barely covers fuel. Never mind food.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.343
I thought you said
this bounty was going to go up?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.346
Well, it did!
Tanaka was worth $1.5 million!

22:27.429 --> 22:29.514
We got charged
for half the goddamn casino

22:29.598 --> 22:30.807
floating out into space!

22:30.891 --> 22:33.977
Hey, it's not our fault
somebody brought a Disruptor to a robbery.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.606
If you would have waited, like I told you,
we could have controlled it!

22:38.273 --> 22:41.485
Just a few of Tanaka's dogs
could have offset the property damage.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.403
But you had to kill them all, Spike.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.864
In my defense,
you tagged the guy with the gold grill,

22:45.947 --> 22:48.492
just as you were telling me
to take him alive, right?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.914
See the look on his face, though?

22:55.582 --> 22:56.666
[chuckles]

22:56.750 --> 22:58.418
He did look pretty shocked. [chuckling]

22:58.502 --> 23:00.253
He was shocked and then he was dead.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.298
[both laugh]

23:06.134 --> 23:08.428
Come on. I got a lead on a bounty.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.014
Asimov Solensan.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.308
Post-Earth refugee.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.811
This is the big lead you got?

23:16.812 --> 23:20.399
Doesn't look like he'll keep the lights on
much less buy me a lobster dinner.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.569
What about the Doleac bounty?
I hear he's still out by the Belt.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.365
I told you. Running after ship-jackers
is a wild goose chase.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.574
And this guy's right in front of us.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.827
Last seen in New Tijuana.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.161
T…

23:33.662 --> 23:35.414
TJ, no. No TJ.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.498
What now?

23:37.582 --> 23:40.168
[sighs] Do you know what I got
the last time I was on TJ?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.711
Herpes? [chuckles]

23:41.795 --> 23:42.629
Stabbed.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.090
You know what I was doing?
Buying a churro.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.300
There's got to be something better, Jet.
Come on.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.718
[Jet] My daughter's turning eight.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.264
And I can't afford to buy her a present
because of you.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.183
I can't afford
a goddamn Walking Sally Doll,

23:55.267 --> 23:58.812
which is apparently all the goddamn rage
in little girls' toys.

23:58.895 --> 23:59.980
Because of you!

24:00.063 --> 24:01.398
Now, this is my ship!

24:01.982 --> 24:03.275
And as long as you're on it,

24:03.358 --> 24:06.111
we're going to go after the bounties
I say we go after.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.573
Do you feel better?

24:11.199 --> 24:12.868
Yeah. A little.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.162
Good.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.498
[sighs] I need this one.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.667
And you owe me, Spike!

24:20.750 --> 24:21.793
Hey, you…

24:27.340 --> 24:28.383
Okay.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.762
All right. [clears throat]

24:34.181 --> 24:35.390
[grunts]

24:35.474 --> 24:36.516
[beeps]

24:41.438 --> 24:42.439
[Spike] Who's she?

24:42.522 --> 24:43.565
Girlfriend, maybe?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.358
Ah, she's pregnant too.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.238
Why do all the pretty ones
end up with psychos?

24:50.322 --> 24:51.531
It's beyond me.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.495
[music playing]

25:19.059 --> 25:21.144
[upbeat music playing]

25:21.228 --> 25:22.229
[indistinct chatter]

25:29.611 --> 25:30.487
[Spike] Excuse me.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.905
Have you seen this man right here?

25:31.988 --> 25:34.658
I ain't seen shit since Earth!

25:36.618 --> 25:38.537
[laughing]

25:38.620 --> 25:39.496
Ooph.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.581
Thank you.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.910
I hate this place. [sighs]

26:20.912 --> 26:21.955
[barkeep] He killed them all.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.249
Some with his bare hands.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.876
I ain't never seen nothing like it.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.837
Then some others, just like them,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.923
they came in
and they, uh, they took away the bodies.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.592
[shudders]

26:34.259 --> 26:35.468
[sighs]

26:35.552 --> 26:36.928
Goddamn Syndicate.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.723
[barkeep] Who else cleans up the dead
like they never died?

26:39.806 --> 26:42.350
[both laugh]

26:42.434 --> 26:43.518
Anything else?

26:46.313 --> 26:47.606
[clears throat]

26:47.689 --> 26:48.523
[scoffs]

26:54.613 --> 26:56.281
-Right before you…
-Mmm-hmm.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.783
someone else came in asking after him.

26:58.867 --> 26:59.743
Who?

26:59.826 --> 27:02.454
Young bird. Purple hair.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.209
That's not what we're here for.
We can't compromise any more.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.502
[Jet] Excuse me, fellas.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.589
Have you, by any chance, seen this man?

27:13.423 --> 27:14.382
I saw him.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.925
Didn't look so good.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.010
Sick maybe.

27:18.011 --> 27:18.845
Really?

27:20.388 --> 27:22.474
Do you know if there's
a clinic or a hospital nearby?

27:25.727 --> 27:28.730
-[sobbing]
-[groaning]

27:34.861 --> 27:35.945
[grunts]

27:43.203 --> 27:44.371
[Spike] May I help you with that?

27:47.290 --> 27:48.166
[woman 1] I'm sorry?

27:49.668 --> 27:50.502
May I?

28:14.025 --> 28:15.694
-It's bad for your health, I hear.
-[scoffs]

28:17.362 --> 28:19.322
Yeah. I've heard that too.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.200
Hey, forgive this for coming off
like a cheap pick-up line,

28:22.283 --> 28:26.705
but what is a nice girl like you doing in
a nasty cesspool of a place like this?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.748
Hmm, I'm just passing through.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.041
Where you headed?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.421
[chuckles] I guess it doesn't matter.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.756
Anywhere's better than this rock,
believe me.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.299
So, why are you here?

28:40.343 --> 28:44.180
Oh, I hear there's, um,
great dancing at The Fox.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.598
[woman 1 chuckling]

28:49.978 --> 28:51.521
Have you ever been to Mars?

28:52.063 --> 28:53.022
I was born there.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.941
I haven't been since I was a little girl.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.068
But I remember it was beautiful.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.195
You know,
a good place to start a new life.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.241
It's never too late to start a new life.

29:05.952 --> 29:06.995
You okay?

29:08.079 --> 29:10.081
Yeah. Never better.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.459
You just…

29:13.084 --> 29:14.002
[somber music playing]

29:16.546 --> 29:18.715
You just remind me of someone.

29:19.674 --> 29:20.508
Really?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.177
[cell phone vibrating]

29:23.678 --> 29:24.596
[beeps]

29:30.351 --> 29:31.227
So, um…

29:33.980 --> 29:35.273
Where's your man?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.151
He's running an errand.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.861
He'll be here shortly.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.739
-Rough trade being a romantic.
-[woman 1] Hmm.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.534
Spoken like a man
who's never been in love.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.660
I was.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.621
Once.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.582
What happened?

29:53.208 --> 29:54.584
I was dreaming.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.420
-It was time to wake up.
-[gun cocks]

29:59.130 --> 30:02.550
[woman 2] Wow. Those are some
real pretty words there, cowboy.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.469
Does that shit work on all the girls?

30:05.261 --> 30:06.429
Can I help you?

30:09.057 --> 30:10.558
Yeah. You can kindly fuck off.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.101
Nothing personal,
your mark's coming with me.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.604
I don't know what you're doing,
but I was here first.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.022
-He's mine.
-The boyfriend?

30:16.105 --> 30:17.774
I don't give a shit about him.
I'm after her.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.275
-What?
-Hi.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.945
One, get that gun off me,
or I'm going to make you eat it.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.030
And two, why would anyone care about her?

30:24.113 --> 30:25.240
There's no bounty on her.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.617
Oh, I care about her
because Ellis Montgomery does.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.828
Pack up your bags,
'cause Daddy wants you home.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.787
No.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.413
-Wait.
-[woman 1] No, no, no.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.583
-She's Katerina Montgomery?
-[woman 2] She is.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.044
Please. Help me, I can't go back there.

30:38.127 --> 30:40.630
[chuckles] I know.
But a whole lot of money says otherwise.

30:40.713 --> 30:41.881
You don't know him!

30:41.965 --> 30:44.342
-You don't know what he's like!
-Everyone knows your dad…

30:44.425 --> 30:47.595
Rich, powerful, total dick.
Get over it and move.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.680
Walk away.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.557
Now.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.185
I don't know if you've noticed, boy toy,
but I'm the one…

30:54.269 --> 30:55.144
Hey! [grunts]

30:55.895 --> 30:56.729
[grunts]

30:56.813 --> 30:58.273
-[gunshot]
-[screams]

30:58.356 --> 30:59.732
[upbeat music playing]

31:01.609 --> 31:02.527
[Asimov] Katerina!

31:03.862 --> 31:05.822
[both grunting]

31:09.450 --> 31:10.368
[woman grunting]

31:19.377 --> 31:20.503
[tires screeching]

31:21.546 --> 31:23.172
[both breathing heavily]

31:23.256 --> 31:25.425
I'll give you one last chance
to stop this shit before I kick you… Ah!

31:26.634 --> 31:28.970
[grunting]

31:39.105 --> 31:40.815
[somber music playing]

31:48.698 --> 31:50.074
[woman grunts]

31:52.994 --> 31:54.662
What the hell, psycho?

31:54.746 --> 31:57.540
The bounty's worth squat
if you put a bullet in them!

31:58.207 --> 32:00.376
-[Spike] How about I put a bullet in you?
-Shit.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.211
-[music playing]
-[knocking at door]

32:02.295 --> 32:03.338
[Jet] Spike!

32:04.714 --> 32:05.548
Spike!

32:07.050 --> 32:08.009
[sighs]

32:08.092 --> 32:08.927
Spike!

32:10.386 --> 32:11.512
Who's in the bathroom?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.432
[woman] Please let me out of here!

32:14.515 --> 32:15.350
[Spike] What?

32:15.433 --> 32:16.684
Who's in the bathroom?

32:17.268 --> 32:20.688
[woman] Hey, dick-hole!
Can you please let me out of here?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.107
-God, does anyone ever clean up in here?
-[buzzer sounds]

32:23.191 --> 32:24.150
Gross!

32:24.233 --> 32:25.693
[scoffs] Finally.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.904
Hey, uh, super cool accommodations,

32:27.987 --> 32:31.908
uh, but do you think you could handcuff me
to an even bigger, more disgusting toilet?

32:31.991 --> 32:33.368
'Cause that would be great.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.370
Who are you supposed to be?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.914
Jet Black, meet Faye Valentine.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.416
Hey… Fuck you!

32:41.209 --> 32:43.127
-[buzzer sounds]
-I'm just kidding. I'm sorry.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.838
We got off on the wrong foot.
Kick the key under the door…

32:45.922 --> 32:47.131
We have a problem.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.467
Apparently, when Asimov showed up
at the bar,

32:49.550 --> 32:51.177
the Syndicate came gunning for him.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.136
The Syndicate?

32:52.220 --> 32:54.639
Yeah, it gets worse.
Asimov is one of them.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.474
He was trying to move Red Eye.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.392
Shit.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.268
[Faye] Are you guys
afraid of the Syndicate?

33:00.019 --> 33:01.145
Okay, who is she?

33:01.229 --> 33:04.524
She's a bounty hunter.
Her mark is Ellis Montgomery's daughter.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.734
Asimov's girl.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.652
God damn it.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.071
[Faye] Yeah, and she's mine,
so don't get any ideas!

33:10.154 --> 33:12.073
They want to escape together
and start a new life

33:12.156 --> 33:14.742
and because Asimov's stupid and in love,
he sees his chance.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.036
So, he stole something from the Syndicate,

33:17.120 --> 33:20.039
trying to make a score on his own,
now they're trying to disappear.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.916
[Faye scoffs] Which they did
thanks to pretty boy.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.960
She said she wanted to go to Mars.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.253
Hmm.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.380
We've got to find Asimov before they do.

33:27.463 --> 33:29.340
And this city is crawling with them.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.551
Okay. Hey, I would agree…

33:32.301 --> 33:34.679
But you always say
that we've got to live by rules,

33:34.762 --> 33:37.682
and the rule is, when it comes
to the Syndicate, we walk away.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.725
Right?

33:38.808 --> 33:40.810
-Suddenly you give a shit about the rules.
-No--

33:40.893 --> 33:43.396
Right when I need to buy my daughter
a birthday present?

33:43.479 --> 33:44.355
Jet!

33:44.439 --> 33:46.024
You don't want my daughter
to have a birthday?

33:46.107 --> 33:47.692
This isn't going to get us paid!

33:47.775 --> 33:49.235
It's going to get us dead.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.280
Hmm.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.700
If Asimov and Katerina
are trying to get to Mars,

33:55.783 --> 33:57.452
-they're going to need a ship.
-[Spike] Oh, no.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.080
And I think I know exactly where
they're going to get it from.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.540
Jet.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.794
Don't appreciate being ignored.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.969
[Faye] All right! Go, team!

34:15.053 --> 34:17.096
We're gonna split this 50-50, right?

34:19.432 --> 34:20.516
Guys?

Okay.

[exhales]

35:41.180 --> 35:42.765
Hey, guys!

35:51.149 --> 35:54.485
Hey, computer, find me
whoever owns this piece of shit boat.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.487
[automated voice] Password required.

36:05.913 --> 36:06.914
Okay.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.292
Fucking idiots.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.088
[tires screeching]

36:27.059 --> 36:28.269
[mechanic] Whoa!

36:28.352 --> 36:30.146
Hey, you guys can't be here!

36:30.855 --> 36:32.523
Spaceport's closed!

36:34.901 --> 36:37.987
You can run, or you can die.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.664
You're going to kill your way to Mars?

36:48.748 --> 36:49.874
You.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.627
-No one has to get hurt here.
-[grunts]

36:52.710 --> 36:53.961
[Katerina shuddering]

36:54.045 --> 36:56.088
You really think
you're going to be safe anywhere?

36:56.172 --> 36:59.258
If the cops and the bounty hunters
don't get you, the Syndicate will.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.635
We'll take our chances.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.929
[Spike] There's no happy ending here
for you, Asimov.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.682
But there can be for her.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.100
What are you doing, Spike?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.519
[Spike] I can help her get away.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.983
You just have to let me.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.740
[somber music playing]

37:36.295 --> 37:37.463
Not interested.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.424

37:41.092 --> 37:42.176
[Katerina] Please don't hurt him!

37:56.816 --> 37:57.942
Asimov!

Kill them all!

38:33.602 --> 38:34.895
You said Asimov was alone!

Who the fuck are these guys?

38:36.480 --> 38:37.523
I don't know!

Come on, we've got to go!

Fearless.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.411
It's not possible.

40:13.494 --> 40:17.248
You're dead. We killed you.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.290
Yeah.

40:18.916 --> 40:19.875
You did.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.545
And I want to keep it that way, Chivo.

Get up, we have to go! Come on.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.934
I'm kind of impressed.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.438
-Daddy's little rich girl can fly.
-[sighs]

41:27.193 --> 41:28.235
Is that my gun?

41:30.154 --> 41:30.988
Give me that.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.159
-You guys are dicks.
-[sighs]

41:38.204 --> 41:39.455
Come on.

Come on.

[chuckles]

41:49.256 --> 41:51.008

41:51.091 --> 41:52.259
Baby, I love you.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.012
I love you, Asimov. [chuckles]

41:55.095 --> 41:56.347
We're going to Mars.

41:56.430 --> 41:57.723
We're going to Mars.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.856
[man over radio] Attention all ships.

42:06.899 --> 42:11.153
This is an ISSP action.
You are ordered to stop.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.279
[sobbing continues]

42:12.947 --> 42:14.532
[warbling]

or you will be fired upon.

[Spike over radio] Katerina, listen to me.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.049
It's over.

42:33.592 --> 42:34.927
There's nowhere to go.

[man] I repeat, turn away from the gate
or you will be fired upon.

Katerina, come on, turn around.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.118
Let me help you.

43:00.619 --> 43:02.121
Just like you said, right?

43:05.499 --> 43:07.418
It's time to wake up.

43:12.631 --> 43:13.966
[engine accelerating]

44:24.870 --> 44:29.333
[man 1] And you will shed
tears of scarlet.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.420
Asimov…

44:35.089 --> 44:36.256
where is he?

44:36.840 --> 44:39.927
I swear, it wasn't our fault.

44:40.886 --> 44:43.430
The place went all to hell,
there were these cowboys and…

44:44.348 --> 44:45.182
they killed him.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.267
[man 1] Cowboys?

44:47.851 --> 44:48.686
[man 2] Yeah.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.562
One of them… [shudders]

44:50.646 --> 44:52.481
he killed Chivo, he killed everyone.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.358
Cowboys

44:55.317 --> 44:57.736
killed a dozen of my men?

44:57.820 --> 44:59.113
[stutters]

44:59.738 --> 45:00.989
I didn't recognize him.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.450
But Chivo, he called him Fearless.

45:03.534 --> 45:04.535
[shuddering]

45:19.591 --> 45:20.467
But…

45:21.969 --> 45:24.847
But that can't be right. Can it?
[scoffs] I mean…

45:26.473 --> 45:27.558
Fearless is dead.

45:30.018 --> 45:30.894
Right?

45:40.529 --> 45:42.114
[groans]

45:44.950 --> 45:47.161
Find this bounty hunter.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.956
If he really is Fearless,

45:52.958 --> 45:54.418
bring me his head.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.365
Is everything okay?
