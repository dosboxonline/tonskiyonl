00:50.053 --> 00:53.264
COCO BEFORE CHANEL

02:04.627 --> 02:08.381
Orphanage Obazine 1893

03:13.571 --> 03:18.243
Girls! Who hopes
to have a visit, come with me.

03:21.454 --> 03:23.623
- Are you coming?
- No.

03:23.623 --> 03:26.542
- It's Daddy!
- I do not want.

04:22.682 --> 04:25.643
I waited for my father one Sunday
after another.

04:25.643 --> 04:28.021
But he never came.

04:27.228 --> 04:29.605
Moulins, 15 years later

04:44.954 --> 04:48.708
<i>I lost my poor Coco,
the dog that I love,</i>

04:48.708 --> 04:52.712
<i>... near the Trocadero
he is so far away.</i>

04:52.712 --> 04:54.547
<i>I recognize
My greatest affliction ...</i>

04:54.547 --> 04:56.507
<i>this loss so cruel ...</i>

04:56.549 --> 04:59.052
<i>... was that while my man
more betrayed me ...</i>

04:59.052 --> 05:02.889
<i>... Coco was more faithful to me.</i>

05:02.889 --> 05:06.893
<i>You have not seen Coco
the Trocadero?</i>

05:07.059 --> 05:09.020
<i>- "Co" in "Tro" -</i>

05:09.061 --> 05:11.606
<i>Coco in the Trocadero?</i>

05:11.606 --> 05:15.568
<i>I wonder who has seen Coco?
Hey! Coco! Hey! Coco!</i>

05:15.568 --> 05:19.572
<i>I wonder who has seen Coco?
Hey! Coco!</i>

05:19.906 --> 05:21.199
To Coco!

05:21.240 --> 05:22.158
Thank you.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.660
- Sit down a little.
- Have open space.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.746
The girls are here.

05:27.663 --> 05:29.749
To Coco!

05:30.500 --> 05:31.667
Thank you.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.753
Excuse me.

05:36.964 --> 05:38.841
Where is it?
I am worth it?

05:38.883 --> 05:40.259
Ah, very nice.

05:40.259 --> 05:42.428
See your Baro there!

05:45.097 --> 05:47.183
- Are you coming?
- No.

05:49.685 --> 05:52.104
Come, please.
Do not be alone.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.402
- Bravo!
- Honey, I present ...

05:58.444 --> 05:59.820
... Etienne Balsan.

05:59.862 --> 06:02.198
- Ah, yes. Great. Pleasure.
- Nice.

06:02.198 --> 06:03.032
Gabrielle ...

06:03.032 --> 06:05.368
- ... sister of Adrienne.
- Pleasure.

06:05.868 --> 06:07.453
Fanny, the queen of the night.

06:07.453 --> 06:09.539
Please.

06:11.123 --> 06:13.376
Sorry if I am indiscreet.

06:13.376 --> 06:14.460
Which
the two is the youngest?

06:14.460 --> 06:15.461
Gabrielle.

06:15.461 --> 06:19.048
The challenge is to guess.
26? 25?

06:19.048 --> 06:21.300
If I'm bored, I'm wrong.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.636
How funny it is!

06:23.636 --> 06:25.513
And tonight?
How old are you?

06:25.555 --> 06:27.640
Tonight, a thousand years.

06:28.057 --> 06:31.060
Nice your sister!
Always says what she thinks?

06:31.060 --> 06:32.019
And you? No?

06:32.061 --> 06:33.145
No.

06:33.145 --> 06:35.898
Where will
  this beauty?

06:36.148 --> 06:38.234
Well, here we are.
Let's drink!

06:38.234 --> 06:39.610
Champagne.
Bottle.

06:39.652 --> 06:41.529
I serve.
Thank you.

06:41.571 --> 06:44.657
Let.
Champagne for Coco.

06:44.657 --> 06:45.741
Gabrielle.

06:45.741 --> 06:47.785
No, no. I do not like.
It looks disgusting.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.912
Prefer Coco.
Coco is more ...

06:49.912 --> 06:51.580
True.
Coco is beautiful!

06:51.580 --> 06:52.665
Is extravagant.

06:52.665 --> 06:54.208
Who
  have bad taste!

06:54.250 --> 06:56.335
But I like it!

06:56.419 --> 06:59.755
You say something nice?

06:59.755 --> 07:02.008
You do not speak that
not unpleasant?

07:02.008 --> 07:05.094
When I speak
I have something to say.

07:05.511 --> 07:08.180
Black eyes.
Black eyes.

07:08.180 --> 07:13.602
<i>... Caroline, Caroline.
Put your patent leather shoes.</i>

07:13.602 --> 07:19.692
<i>Caroline. It's Sunday.
Put your flowered hat.</i>

07:19.692 --> 07:25.865
<i>Caroline, Caroline.
It stops well on the way.</i>

07:25.865 --> 07:32.121
<i>Walk faster, my small
Or you'll make us lose the train.</i>

07:33.956 --> 07:37.710
Ladies! The skirt
is descosturando. It is urgent.

07:46.469 --> 07:49.305
It is the frill of
lining. Take.

07:50.056 --> 07:51.807
  Oh, as if not
had nothing easier!

07:51.807 --> 07:53.893
  Please!

08:19.001 --> 08:21.003
Finished.

08:21.003 --> 08:24.173
- Do not tell me the end.
- Always the same story.

08:24.173 --> 08:27.593
Blanche, the little orphan,
overcomes all obstacles ...

08:27.593 --> 08:30.179
... and marries the prince.

08:30.763 --> 08:34.850
- Come on, the story of my life!
- If you already have, had not thought of.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.644
You're evil.

08:36.685 --> 08:38.229
- Have you been to India?
- No.

08:38.270 --> 08:39.605
Blanche yes, for
demonstrate ...

08:39.605 --> 08:41.857
... who did not want the
Prince for his money.

08:42.441 --> 08:44.151
You want me to go to India?

08:44.193 --> 08:46.529
Expect a lot of money
of your Baron. This is a den.

08:46.529 --> 08:48.614
Will not leave.

08:48.864 --> 08:51.951
He loves me. You see?
He introduced me to his friend.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.869
It is to show to friends
he sleeps ...

08:53.869 --> 08:55.871
... with a young girl.

08:55.871 --> 08:59.959
Love is beautiful only in novels.
It touches the heart.

09:01.293 --> 09:05.548
The only thing that matters
in love is making love.

09:05.548 --> 09:09.051
Too bad for this,
we need a man!

09:24.400 --> 09:26.485
Come on, Cocoric?!

09:39.248 --> 09:41.000
Come, gentlemen.
To Coco.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.251
Grateful!
Thank you.

09:42.251 --> 09:44.044
To Coco!

09:44.086 --> 09:47.006
- You were fabulous!
- Thank you, Mr. Balsan.

09:47.006 --> 09:48.799
- Very nice.
- No, really.

09:48.841 --> 09:51.093
- She liked it back?
- Is it the last time ...

09:51.093 --> 09:53.053
... missed some nuances.
I needed ...

09:53.095 --> 09:55.180
Make me company?

10:00.102 --> 10:03.939
- He said something that bothered?
- No, just wanted to leave us alone.

10:03.939 --> 10:07.276
She believes in love and
I want to convert.

10:08.193 --> 10:10.154
It may be a change
of air.

10:10.195 --> 10:11.989
And then, what I
I have to do?

10:12.031 --> 10:15.034
Blush?
Download the eyes?

10:15.034 --> 10:17.494
Or say
"Please, dear?

10:17.494 --> 10:19.747
... or:
"Yes, my love?"

10:20.539 --> 10:23.042
I like "Yes, my love."
Yes, I like that.

10:23.042 --> 10:24.793
A woman in love ...

10:24.793 --> 10:26.754
... not more than one
submissive bitch.

10:26.754 --> 10:29.798
Yes, with tongue
outward

10:29.798 --> 10:31.759
... a bitch
lame.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.969
A woman in love
is pathetic.

10:34.470 --> 10:35.596
Are you nervous?

10:35.637 --> 10:38.057
- No.
- Yes! You are nervous.

10:39.725 --> 10:42.895
- Something to drink?
- Champagne.

10:43.729 --> 10:46.398
See? I was sure that
I could use you.

10:46.398 --> 10:48.233
He is very friendly
director of the house.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.070
If you speak ill of the hall,
the owner is going to pamper.

10:51.070 --> 10:53.238
Six times a day
can be in Paris!

10:55.657 --> 10:57.910
- And beyond that, it pleases you?
- Balsan?

10:57.910 --> 10:59.995
Are you crazy?
With that face.

10:59.995 --> 11:02.081
Liar! I am sure
is irony.

11:02.081 --> 11:04.041
It's so dopey
as the others.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.168
And he has contacts.

11:06.668 --> 11:08.921
  We have to choose
another song.

11:08.921 --> 11:10.964
- Something more chic.
- I agree.

11:11.006 --> 11:13.425
And we have to get
money for this story.

11:13.759 --> 11:16.095
Okay. Leftover
three bottles.

11:16.095 --> 11:18.013
See how it is
so complicated?

11:18.013 --> 11:19.723
Keep it up and
everybody wins.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.433
But what is the secret?

11:21.433 --> 11:23.769
Make me a whore
to fill their pockets?

11:23.685 --> 11:25.562
Ah, so how?

11:25.604 --> 11:28.273
Violet, you know
Coco's song?

11:28.273 --> 11:30.192
- Yes
- For now, you sing.

11:30.192 --> 11:32.611
And you go to hell.
Do not want to see more.

11:32.611 --> 11:34.696
Not you too.

11:35.197 --> 11:38.617
  And now, as
we buy clothes?

11:44.706 --> 11:46.792
Are you crazy?

11:52.130 --> 11:55.133
... care with the horn! Run!

11:58.303 --> 12:02.558
<i>I am a woman  stingray.
I twist.</i>

12:02.558 --> 12:04.601
<i>When I play,
be careful.</i>

12:04.643 --> 12:06.270
<i>Or
electrocuted.</i>

12:06.311 --> 12:07.938
No, wrong.
When you sing ...

12:07.980 --> 12:09.606
... "I am a woman ray" ...

12:09.648 --> 12:11.108
You have to show
something amazing ...

12:11.149 --> 12:12.985
... as swung
  on the public.

12:12.985 --> 12:15.070
Let. Again.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.082
What are you doing?

12:27.082 --> 12:30.419
Need at least 10 cm
off the back.

12:36.592 --> 12:38.844
Are you crazy? You will open?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.721
You have to be able to
move with the dress.

12:40.762 --> 12:42.848
Are you comfortable?

12:47.603 --> 12:49.688
Sing again.

12:53.942 --> 12:55.152
Think will endure?

12:55.193 --> 12:57.112
It would be amused
money fell.

12:57.112 --> 12:59.781
At least, they would
than they would see.

13:08.123 --> 13:09.916
Hello, Coco.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.044
Good morning.

13:15.714 --> 13:18.133
It's fun to see me
working like crazy?

13:18.216 --> 13:20.135
No.

13:20.135 --> 13:22.012
Very nice
this model!

13:22.054 --> 13:24.723
We talk a moment?
Sorry, Madam.

13:24.723 --> 13:26.808
Is that in a hurry.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.021
I would love to
meet you.

13:31.063 --> 13:34.399
- Still working at night?
- No.

13:34.399 --> 13:37.069
Then you will
time?

13:39.571 --> 13:42.824
Listen, I have an idea.
Do not fret.

13:42.824 --> 13:45.327
Could invite her
dinner?

13:46.078 --> 13:49.081
Better than
converted to the religion of love.

13:49.081 --> 13:50.624
I?

13:50.665 --> 13:52.000
- It's not my type.
- Just as well.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.377
Miss?

13:53.418 --> 13:55.587
You are not paid for
  get chatting.

13:56.004 --> 13:57.381
What do you say?

13:57.422 --> 13:59.508
Okay.

14:00.842 --> 14:04.346
Well, see you soon.
Lady ...

14:04.346 --> 14:06.515
... if I may,
a very lively meeting.

14:06.515 --> 14:08.600
Thank you.

14:12.270 --> 14:15.190
- Do not eat it?
- Not at all.

14:15.190 --> 14:18.110
As a child, we ate
daily, then enjoei.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.694
My family was very rich.

14:19.694 --> 14:21.863
My father was a merchant
wine.

14:22.030 --> 14:24.116
I thought you
was an orphan.

14:24.449 --> 14:26.701
Of course, for you
all the singers are.

14:26.701 --> 14:29.454
I told you so.
Is that his sister told him ...

14:29.454 --> 14:32.791
... die. And she said she
was an orphan. So, I said.

14:33.041 --> 14:36.128
She likes to be the victim.
Do you think it is moving.

14:36.128 --> 14:39.548
In fact, my father
  loved. I was the favorite.

14:39.548 --> 14:42.134
When my mother died,
was to make his fortune in America.

14:42.134 --> 14:44.803
You see? I have a father.
I'm not an orphan.

14:44.803 --> 14:47.139
Is no crime
be an orphan.

14:47.139 --> 14:49.558
If not, I would
rotting in jail ...

14:49.558 --> 14:51.434
... because I am an orphan.

14:51.476 --> 14:54.062
- Oh?
- My parents died 2 years ago.

14:54.312 --> 14:57.482
- Too bad.
- No, it is rather a joy!

14:57.482 --> 14:59.276
It is payback.

14:59.317 --> 15:00.610
We had
relationship indifferent.

15:00.652 --> 15:02.154
It was all a
tricky.

15:02.154 --> 15:04.030
- They hit on you?
- What?

15:04.072 --> 15:05.282
If they beat you up?

15:05.323 --> 15:07.409
No, by God.
For what?

15:07.409 --> 15:10.745
I wish I had had reason
to hate them, but ...

15:12.080 --> 15:14.249
... no! Say
  I saw ...

15:14.249 --> 15:16.334
... course to
  lacked imagination.

15:16.334 --> 15:18.420
It was a real torment.

15:18.670 --> 15:20.171
As for me, my aunts
I have created.

15:20.171 --> 15:22.173
They beat me
and killed me to death.

15:22.173 --> 15:23.383
No!

15:23.425 --> 15:26.511
I always hoped that my father
back too, but ...

15:27.429 --> 15:28.680
Poor Coco!

15:28.680 --> 15:32.601
Why are educated as
you, with so much money,

15:32.601 --> 15:35.270
... children grow
bitter or delayed.

15:35.270 --> 15:38.523
Retarded. Yes I
  agrees.

15:38.523 --> 15:40.775
Looks like I left!
Is unfortunate.

15:40.775 --> 15:42.527
Should have
known you before.

15:42.527 --> 15:44.029
Oh, Etienne!

15:44.029 --> 15:44.905
Excuse me.

15:44.946 --> 15:47.282
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:49.534 --> 15:54.289
The contrary. To her, it should
have known much later.

15:56.958 --> 16:00.211
Plumas too. Makeup
too. Ornaments too.

16:00.211 --> 16:01.504
All others.

16:01.546 --> 16:02.547
And you?
How do you see?

16:02.547 --> 16:04.633
I mean ...

16:05.550 --> 16:08.219
- I look like a whore?
- No.

16:08.386 --> 16:10.472
It's my dress
the show.

16:10.805 --> 16:14.309
Oh, no! The flower is saved
the dress.

16:14.309 --> 16:16.394
Women stingray!

16:56.017 --> 16:58.353
Begin on Tuesday
coming. At 10.

16:58.353 --> 17:00.188
Long before the ballet.

17:00.188 --> 17:02.440
Our own cabaret.
You imagine?

17:02.440 --> 17:06.528
With our name on the door.

17:08.029 --> 17:12.117
The glory and fortune
ahead.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.202
Paris awaits us!

17:15.620 --> 17:16.955
I can not sing
with you.

17:16.955 --> 17:18.373
But you
saying?

17:18.373 --> 17:20.708
Maurice asked me
in marriage.

17:21.459 --> 17:23.795
We will live by
Paris.

17:27.048 --> 17:29.217
I will be a Baroness.

17:29.217 --> 17:31.386
And he does not want
I come to sing.

17:33.388 --> 17:36.307
Listen: Do you think a
Baron is getting married ...

17:36.307 --> 17:38.560
... with someone like you?
See if you agree!

17:39.561 --> 17:41.729
We tested, we
the song, you stay with me.

17:41.729 --> 17:43.815
Not want to sing.

17:46.151 --> 17:47.735
He knows that his mother died
misery?

17:47.735 --> 17:51.072
What is your father marketer, which
you left at nine years?

17:53.032 --> 17:55.368
I hope one day
forgive me.

18:04.669 --> 18:08.256
<i>Maestro, music!
Gentlemen, you pay at the exit.</i>

18:08.256 --> 18:12.177
<i>I am the electric ray.
It's wonderful, is electrifying.</i>

18:12.260 --> 18:15.763
<i>When I play, a discharge.
I have seen young and old ...</i>

18:15.763 --> 18:19.851
<i>... rendered down to my feet ...</i>

18:21.311 --> 18:27.025
<i>... with air deprotection.</i>

18:27.525 --> 18:32.614
<i>I'm the stingray,
I twist.</i>

18:32.447 --> 18:34.407
<i>When I play,
be careful.</i>

18:34.449 --> 18:36.075
<i>Or
electrocuted.</i>

18:36.117 --> 18:38.912
<i>What happiness!</i>

18:38.912 --> 18:40.538
<i>I  electricity</i>

18:40.538 --> 18:42.248
<i>Come, gentlemen,
for little money,</i>

<i>know what
is the fire and more ...</i>

18:47.879 --> 18:49.964
Thank you, miss.

18:55.845 --> 18:57.931
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:59.891 --> 19:01.976
- Allows me?
- Exactly.

19:06.648 --> 19:08.733
Ladies!

19:09.400 --> 19:11.027
Good morning.

19:11.069 --> 19:12.445
How are you, Coco?

19:12.487 --> 19:15.323
Forgot that where you
presented itself was the same?

19:15.323 --> 19:19.494
Look, I know the director
the Rotonde.

19:19.494 --> 19:21.746
Better leave
there.

19:26.584 --> 19:29.253
- I come to say goodbye.
- Where are you?

19:29.253 --> 19:32.006
I said. I will return
home.

19:32.006 --> 19:35.218
- You do not live here?
- No. God forbid.

19:35.218 --> 19:38.012
I'm here when I
I submit to the Army.

19:38.012 --> 19:40.348
I am a genuine
Paris.

19:40.932 --> 19:43.017
- Ah, you live in Paris?
- Yeah.

19:43.017 --> 19:46.521
Not much in Paris. Rather
further. It is in Compi?gne.

19:47.188 --> 19:52.151
Well, the time
to say goodbye.

19:53.444 --> 19:55.655
I was happy to have
known you.

19:56.447 --> 19:57.365
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:57.365 --> 20:00.201
- Good luck, Coco.
- Bye.

22:22.343 --> 22:24.428
Thank you.

22:43.656 --> 22:45.157
Miss?

22:45.199 --> 22:46.492
Come to see Mr. Balsan.

22:46.534 --> 22:49.704
- Who should I advertise?
- Gabrielle. Coco!

22:56.877 --> 22:58.963
Go, go!

23:01.716 --> 23:03.801
Come, come.
Come!

23:05.803 --> 23:08.305
Come!
Come, come.

23:08.806 --> 23:10.891
- Very well, very well.
- Sir?

23:13.310 --> 23:15.396
Coco?

23:17.898 --> 23:19.275
What are you doing here?

23:19.316 --> 23:21.110
My sister lives near here.

23:21.152 --> 23:23.654
I wanted to make a surprise
but she was not at home.

23:23.654 --> 23:26.073
But I remembered that
you lived in the region.

23:26.323 --> 23:28.909
He would not sleep in the station.

23:29.326 --> 23:33.414
Ah, what a fright! Until
I felt that my absence.

23:34.665 --> 23:39.253
Joseph, please install
Mlle. Coco on the fourth of flowers.

23:39.253 --> 23:43.257
Since you're here,
I will not let her on the street.

23:55.269 --> 23:57.354
Between.

25:04.922 --> 25:09.093
Do you like books? Not
bother. I have not read any.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.345
Come, I want to show
thing.

25:14.098 --> 25:17.685
Coco, I present
you my family!

25:17.685 --> 25:22.356
Family, I present
Coco. Reverence.

25:22.773 --> 25:25.943
My grandfather, founder of
Dynasty Balsan.

25:25.943 --> 25:27.152
A great man.

25:27.194 --> 25:30.280
This is the other that Gabrielle
knew before I met you.

25:30.280 --> 25:34.034
Gabrielle Balsan. Married,
had children. Thank God.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.120
It looks like you.

25:37.121 --> 25:39.707
God! What horror
you're right.

25:39.707 --> 25:41.291
Remind me that I took.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.961
This is a De La Patelli?re.
A fraud. My cousin.

25:43.961 --> 25:46.463
Thank God
died destitute.

25:51.218 --> 25:54.888
And this is my fourth.

25:56.140 --> 25:59.226
Come on, do not be shy.
We need not be pretending.

26:15.743 --> 26:17.286
Minuch won!

26:17.327 --> 26:21.165
He made an incredible race,
but had much luck.

26:21.165 --> 26:23.167
Washington
not the President, the horse ...

26:23.167 --> 26:25.669
... burned twice
the start and was disqualified.

26:25.669 --> 26:26.712
But that's not all.

26:26.754 --> 26:30.507
Flight of the Night who was the favorite
off the runway. Off the runway!

26:30.507 --> 26:33.343
And Minuch had to come
the goal.

26:33.343 --> 26:36.180
Something he did not play
soil. In a flash!

26:36.764 --> 26:38.432
I'm speaking Greek, no?

26:38.432 --> 26:40.934
Here, you have to
became interested in horses.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.728
Why do not you
ready? The car awaits you.

26:42.770 --> 26:44.480
I wanted to
here a little longer.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.023
Not have to visit your sister?

26:46.023 --> 26:49.359
- It's not quite know where you live.
- Look, I have to have a lot of wine ...

26:49.359 --> 26:51.445
... because I have guests.

26:51.528 --> 26:54.448
- You have back home.
- I will be very discreet.

26:54.448 --> 26:57.367
Oh, no. Not my style.
Make me Bluebeard ...

26:57.367 --> 26:58.535
... and lock you up
in my room. No.

26:58.535 --> 27:01.205
Relax. No
know I'm here.

27:01.455 --> 27:05.959
Okay.
Two days. No more!

27:11.131 --> 27:15.719
- You should try with a cell.
- Not found.

27:17.304 --> 27:20.891
- You think in 2 days I can?
- Certainly not.

27:23.477 --> 27:25.521
This is impossible!

27:25.562 --> 27:28.065
- Miss, could see it!
- How so?

27:28.065 --> 27:31.068
- I can not let this lot.
- And now? Beat with your foot?

27:31.735 --> 27:34.488
Miss, come back!
Miss, the harness.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.074
Miss! Miss!

28:10.691 --> 28:14.111
Friends! Propose
that sit at the table.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.370
- The blonde nudged up?
- I feel sorry.

28:23.370 --> 28:26.456
I had to be here to
meet one of these girls.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.166
You see the darling
the boss?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.543
What seems to set up?

28:29.543 --> 28:32.546
Come on, come on!
Fast! Hurry!

28:32.713 --> 28:35.048
Joseph, pour the champagne
the cup which I separated.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.134
Yes, sir.

28:38.218 --> 28:41.138
- And some small truffles.
- Yes, sir.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.479
Give me another napkin,
this is dirty.

28:49.479 --> 28:51.440
It's yours.
Is your napkin.

28:51.481 --> 28:55.569
- Save the dirty napkins?
- Yes, miss.

29:01.908 --> 29:07.831
Coco, I am Bluebeard.
Give me a little of what is mine.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.502
To my knowledge, nothing
to say tonight ...

29:12.502 --> 29:15.172
... can be used against
me. Huh?

29:15.672 --> 29:17.841
You behaved optimally.

29:17.841 --> 29:22.512
Charitable as a saint,
neither had seen nor heard.

29:22.512 --> 29:23.680
Let me!

29:23.680 --> 29:25.515
Where was hidden
my pussy?

29:25.515 --> 29:27.142
Was hidden
in my attic?

29:27.184 --> 29:29.686
- In my attic.
- Leave me alone!

29:30.437 --> 29:34.524
You do not know how
I hated! What heat.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.777
I have to get rid of
hair. They were my great-grandfather ...

29:36.777 --> 29:38.445
... and this thing loads
the hair of a dead man.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.530
- Help me.
- No.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.951
Why not? Why not?

29:45.452 --> 29:48.455
Wait. Not usually
about Japan?

29:48.455 --> 29:50.624
- Japan?
- Of course.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.000
For in Japan
are geishas.

29:52.042 --> 29:53.293
You know what
a geisha?

29:53.293 --> 29:56.129
A geisha is a woman who
is revealed by her man.

29:56.129 --> 30:00.383
Wash it, wear it, take the
hair of your clothes. Understand?

30:00.383 --> 30:02.010
In other words,
a slave.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.971
In a way.
Come on, come on. Turn around.

30:05.555 --> 30:07.057
And help me to take
hair.

30:07.057 --> 30:09.142
Go, go, go!
Otherwise ...

30:10.393 --> 30:14.231
... for the season.
Come on, help me.

30:14.481 --> 30:17.901
Ah, my little geisha.

30:18.985 --> 30:22.572
Who left you here so
alone? Long?

30:22.572 --> 30:26.326
And where is this
small grove?

30:30.080 --> 30:34.668
I am terrible
heartless Bluebeard.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.291
Okay.
Soon we are here.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.376
I can not stay with you?

31:16.376 --> 31:18.795
No. I can not take you,
because I have to stay in the gallery.

31:19.212 --> 31:19.796
Do you mind?

31:19.796 --> 31:22.299
Should like. Staying here
below is much better.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.801
So you will not have to
hold talks ...

31:24.801 --> 31:28.388
the cream of the penniless.
I assure you.

31:29.556 --> 31:32.225
Dynamite and Big Dreams.
Horse of the third row.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.311
Can be quiet.
These are my horses.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.396
Sorry.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.957
But ... Oh

32:39.542 --> 32:41.586
I believed
never see you.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.380
You read my letters?
Why did not you say?

32:45.048 --> 32:47.133
I was bored.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.886
- And you, what are you doing here?
- I came with Balsan.

32:49.719 --> 32:52.388
- How? You live with it?
- What do you think?

32:52.388 --> 32:54.974
I live in a castle, have a
bathtub in my room ...

32:54.974 --> 32:57.644
... a king size bed, created
at my disposal.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.395
I have not seen anything like it.
It is a dream.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.315
When I would think
we would be neighbors!

33:03.483 --> 33:05.819
So, what you like
is with your Baron?

33:05.819 --> 33:07.529
Okay. We
very passionate.

33:07.570 --> 33:10.156
- We live half hidden.
- Do you hide?

33:10.156 --> 33:13.743
No! Let's get married.
Like the dress?

33:13.743 --> 33:15.161
It is a gift from Maurice.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.997
You will arrive full of clay
house with that tail.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.083
Do not be silly.
It is a model in Paris!

33:21.000 --> 33:23.336
While you're there,
I will not decompose.

33:24.587 --> 33:27.423
Look at this. Are
dying of boredom.

33:30.009 --> 33:33.012
One day will fight for
sit at our table.

33:43.523 --> 33:46.109
What good is already agreed.
Did not want to go, without saying goodbye.

33:46.109 --> 33:48.945
- Do not forget the white chocolate.
- Are already in the basket.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.030
Great.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.950
I will not be here, but
a driver will take you to the station.

33:56.119 --> 33:58.204
You okay?

33:58.621 --> 34:01.124
I hope you write me
and tell me how it goes.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.294
- He put the raspberry preserves?
- Yes, sir.

34:04.294 --> 34:05.837
They should enjoy.

34:05.878 --> 34:09.632
Make the fruits of the garden.
Is delicious!

34:09.632 --> 34:11.259
Well ...

34:11.301 --> 34:13.386
- ... goodbye.
- Bye.

34:20.977 --> 34:25.231
<i>- Emilienne is jovial.
- Thanks, Etienne.</i>

34:25.231 --> 34:29.902
<i>always so gallant.
I have to talk about my jockey.</i>

34:29.902 --> 34:32.572
<i>- No!
- Yes, absolutely yes.</i>

34:34.741 --> 34:36.826
<i>Come on, friends.
All.</i>

34:40.246 --> 34:43.166
Miss!
Your car waiting.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.022
I will not need
it, thank you.

36:07.583 --> 36:10.503
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy!

36:10.503 --> 36:12.463
Sorry. I wanted
ride it last.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.257
Loose, or caught
  the other horses.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.842
What are you doing,
riding a horse?

36:15.842 --> 36:17.927
Always been my passion.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.847
- They have saved me from suicide.
- Of Suicide?

36:20.847 --> 36:22.473
When my aunts
used to beat me,

36:22.515 --> 36:25.393
... I fled to mount
their horses ranchers.

36:25.268 --> 36:28.855
- Call this ride a horse?
- A does not.

36:28.855 --> 36:30.857
You were
hiding this girl?

36:30.857 --> 36:32.900
I do not do any good.

36:32.942 --> 36:37.780
Come.
I present to you Coco!

36:37.780 --> 36:40.283
A young woman full of surprises
and good.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.119
What a beautiful fantasy!

36:44.370 --> 36:48.332
You left him
a suit Amazon?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.878
I would not be surprised that
this - I do not remember the name ...

36:51.878 --> 36:55.965
... dure. It is a charm
but it is a real problem.

36:55.965 --> 36:58.509
I think I ate too much.

36:58.509 --> 37:01.721
It's always day.
You are a heaven.

37:02.221 --> 37:05.641
- Where's your jock?
- He ran the floor. And it can be.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.602
- Are you done?
- Soon we'll see.

37:07.602 --> 37:11.272
It was upon as a
monkey. Even in my dressing room!

37:11.272 --> 37:14.233
Seriously! And stocky.
A man like that.

37:14.317 --> 37:16.652
It was so well endowed.
What saboteur!

37:16.652 --> 37:19.238
True. Are all
saboteurs, gentlemen!

37:19.238 --> 37:22.491
Saboteurs, yes.
But essential.

37:22.992 --> 37:27.246
That's right. Yet
I prefer men to women.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.414
What a liar!

37:28.456 --> 37:30.916
You at least lie well.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.920
And you, young lady, what do you think?

37:35.004 --> 37:38.674
What are your preferences?
Contact yes, without fear.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.093
- Talk, yes!
- Say something.

37:41.594 --> 37:44.180
Come on, talk!
Cat got your tongue?

37:45.514 --> 37:47.266
The skin does not understand
gender.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.645
- Ah!
- Not bad, huh?

37:50.853 --> 37:52.938
And as you
came to this conclusion?

37:53.481 --> 37:55.566
Deleting the light.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.152
Very good!

37:58.194 --> 38:00.112
True.

38:00.112 --> 38:04.200
So, that said, I propose
something to drink ...

38:04.200 --> 38:06.535
and soon you are playing another game.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.956
How are these practices
clothes! You know you understand.

38:12.249 --> 38:15.378
Your have a lot of line, Miss.
And we, here, assembled ...

38:15.378 --> 38:18.255
... like dolls on top
a cake.

38:18.631 --> 38:20.508
Onward!

38:20.549 --> 38:22.635
- Come on, come on.
- Come on.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.438
Did not give you
the best room!

38:35.731 --> 38:38.401
Even the poor had Mo
the blue room.

38:38.401 --> 38:39.902
You're not even
his type.

38:39.902 --> 38:43.531
Should by a corset.
I would be more feminine.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.575
- Ah! One of the screen.
- Prove it.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.995
Can you help?

38:54.333 --> 38:57.002
Is very
beautiful without the hat.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.088
Thank you.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.595
There it is.

39:08.931 --> 39:10.391
How funny!
I feel naked.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.269
It has front
nose and mouth, right?

39:13.352 --> 39:14.395
<i>Emilienne, where is it?</i>

39:14.436 --> 39:16.772
You can not stay quiet
one minute. How awful!

39:17.106 --> 39:19.775
Yes, but think that
have money for the feathers!

39:19.775 --> 39:21.235
How so?

39:21.277 --> 39:24.864
With this thing in the head, which
I do not know is how you can think.

39:25.114 --> 39:27.783
- Think?
- In your face, I say that dreams have it.

39:28.951 --> 39:32.121
- It Balsan to take?
- What did he tell you?

39:32.371 --> 39:34.540
Is there anything else I
prevents them from thinking?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.877
Come on, tell me. Do not be afraid.
No one bothers me.

39:40.880 --> 39:45.134
Should get rid of it all.
It is a bit carnivalesque.

39:45.217 --> 39:48.554
Oh, no. Let the ornaments.
Otherwise, I would feel poor.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.598
Do not call her.
It's a bit simplistic.

39:50.639 --> 39:53.058
Oh no, I told you.
We will set up Joan of Arc ...

39:53.058 --> 39:56.145
- At the Odeon and gave me the paper.
- And you make the maiden?

39:56.145 --> 39:58.647
- Yes
- Pinch yourself!

40:01.567 --> 40:05.237
<i>has to be good.
Left, right. Left, right.</i>

40:05.237 --> 40:07.907
Understand? Good
Let's gallop a little.

40:07.907 --> 40:10.242
- Close your right eye.
- I can not.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.660
It may be the left.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.996
- Closed or not?
- What else do you give lessons?

40:13.996 --> 40:17.499
No. It is very important that
you can ride with an eye ...

40:17.499 --> 40:21.420
... that, riding, so
can work with others. Understand?

40:21.837 --> 40:24.340
Look. This is what I
revealing to you ...

40:24.340 --> 40:26.175
... is a secret
only forward ...

40:26.175 --> 40:27.718
... from father to son
between Balsan.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.179
I will become the
Amazon's best Royallieu.

40:30.512 --> 40:33.849
No. It would take months,
or perhaps years.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.809
- How so?
- How so?!

40:35.851 --> 40:39.438
I should have understood and
have put it on the train ...

40:39.438 --> 40:41.523
... while still
was time.

41:32.574 --> 41:35.077
But what you
made this thing?

41:35.077 --> 41:37.162
What happened to the
I dress as a gift?

41:37.162 --> 41:39.039
With the filthy window.
It seemed that ...

41:39.081 --> 41:40.582
... I was wearing
your curtains.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.626
Alas! You
almost like a woman.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.671
Disappointed? But
think I'm any.

41:48.257 --> 41:51.844
Not bad.
I offer my respects.

41:51.844 --> 41:55.389
Toma!
That was good.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.350
Would not see the actress, but the
good counselor who helped ...

41:58.350 --> 42:01.437
that helped the so-Conde
such a choice not without looking.

42:01.437 --> 42:04.189
I act very badly, that
has no competition for me.

42:04.273 --> 42:07.609
It's like being a lure
tourism or ...

42:07.609 --> 42:09.153
... movement
art.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.072
- And never get nervous?
- Yes

42:12.072 --> 42:15.284
But less and less.
And this is not a good sign.

42:15.284 --> 42:16.910
You have to see me.
So leave a little.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.704
I work at the Chatelet
every night ...

42:18.704 --> 42:21.456
... and could make me a hat
style of another?

42:21.456 --> 42:23.625
- Do not know the success it did!
- Of course.

42:25.127 --> 42:27.087
Indeed, a good time.

42:27.129 --> 42:29.381
You will get
something remarkable.

42:29.381 --> 42:30.549
How?

42:30.591 --> 42:33.552
I beat my record
stay with Balsan.

42:33.552 --> 42:38.682
My friends! Safra
1882, we will enjoy.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.894
So beautiful!
And I a drunk!

42:41.894 --> 42:44.062
Balsan said he met
you in a cafe-concert.

42:44.229 --> 42:48.317
No. In fact, it was
without a coffee fix!

42:48.650 --> 42:52.237
- It has a beautiful voice.
- Really? I'd love to hear.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.239
- No.
- Yes, Yes, Coco!

42:54.239 --> 42:56.742
You'll sing. It will
be the music of Coco?

42:56.742 --> 42:57.910
- No.
- Yes, you will sing.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.996
Who has seen Coco?
Coco the Trocadero?

43:00.996 --> 43:02.039
Come on, sing!

43:02.080 --> 43:04.333
- Come!
- Sing!

43:08.587 --> 43:09.630
You have to do
effort.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.506
Show a little
enthusiasm and enjoy.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.384
People want to have fun.
You are here to entertain us.

43:14.384 --> 43:15.093
So, sing!

43:15.093 --> 43:18.513
Coco accepted sing
us about their music.

43:18.805 --> 43:21.183
- Do you know Coco? "You saw Coco"?
- Yes Yes

43:21.350 --> 43:25.437
Otherwise, the outside horses.
She has company.

45:28.310 --> 45:30.395
I can see ...

45:34.065 --> 45:35.942
... what are you reading?

45:35.984 --> 45:39.821
Even the most foolish serials
have something interesting to tell.

45:40.655 --> 45:44.159
Imagine what could
teach the other books!

45:45.827 --> 45:50.498
It's funny! I was looking for you
and was sure he was here.

45:50.498 --> 45:53.084
Someone has to read the
his books, is not it?

45:53.084 --> 45:56.338
Before that, it has
ride my horses. Come!

45:57.255 --> 45:59.341
Coco! Dress!

46:11.019 --> 46:13.939
ECONOMIC CONTRADICTIONS
Philosophy of Misery (P. J. Proudhon)

46:14.105 --> 46:16.191
You are elegant.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.785
Go!

46:42.968 --> 46:45.053
You were right!

46:52.227 --> 46:55.063
You do not have
afraid of anything.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.524
Your name?

46:57.565 --> 46:59.359
Gabrielle.

46:59.401 --> 47:01.277
But all I
call Coco.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.071
They call me Boy

47:03.071 --> 47:06.074
But in my land
'm Arthur Capel.

47:09.077 --> 47:12.747
The bad thing is that the last
be sure they do not leave us.

47:13.081 --> 47:15.166
They are for life.

47:15.583 --> 47:18.169
My father was looking
I put the nickname Coco.

47:18.586 --> 47:21.840
Every morning I wake up
Cocoric? singing.

47:21.840 --> 47:28.096
Cocoric? soon turned to Coco,
and it was so.

47:33.435 --> 47:36.187
<i>I wonder who has seen Coco?
My Coco ...</i>

47:36.187 --> 47:38.857
It was his great success when
I took the den where he sang.

47:38.857 --> 47:42.777
You understand, right? Coco
and I, rich. "Coco - Rico."

47:44.529 --> 47:47.449
- I'm bothering you?
- I was congratulating Coco ...

47:47.449 --> 47:49.534
... for his style.
- Ah, for your style? Yes!

47:50.034 --> 47:52.370
Do not praise too, otherwise
'll be without Taylor.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.706
Who is the woman who wears
dresses seamless

47:54.706 --> 47:59.043
the sensible shoes,
hats without feathers,

47:59.043 --> 48:00.920
this is Coco.

48:00.962 --> 48:03.131
You are right to elect
simplicity, miss.

48:03.131 --> 48:04.883
Really? You think?

48:04.883 --> 48:07.385
Cause I like women
if adorn all.

48:07.802 --> 48:11.556
Even so, there's no where to get!
- Stop!

48:12.640 --> 48:14.100
No!

48:14.142 --> 48:16.227
I do not see that.

48:16.227 --> 48:19.481
True. Something
that makes it different.

48:19.731 --> 48:23.401
But you only really understand
the dung of camels ...

48:30.325 --> 48:32.285
- Are you sick?
- No.

48:32.327 --> 48:36.581
Well then please feel free to eat,
dress up and down.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.833
It is impolite to
my friends waiting.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.919
Alas!

48:41.419 --> 48:43.505
What, Coco?
Huh?

48:44.172 --> 48:46.508
I'm sick of playing
a clown for these degenerates.

48:46.508 --> 48:48.218
I tired
their mood swings.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.428
Ah, the lord of the castle
tired. What a novelty!

48:51.930 --> 48:54.432
- Do not tell me with that tone.
- I speak as you want!

48:54.432 --> 48:57.185
No! Shut up!
Understand?

48:57.185 --> 48:59.854
You are a rude!
Imagine if it were not rich!

48:59.854 --> 49:02.690
See how your friends
give you up quickly!

49:03.858 --> 49:05.944
Okay.

49:06.361 --> 49:08.947
Let's forget it.
Go down when you are calm.

49:08.947 --> 49:11.866
I will not calm down.
What do you think?

49:12.867 --> 49:16.287
Goal with their wealth, with
with their gambling and their whores!

49:16.287 --> 49:18.081
Why would I here, knowing
better gallop, ...?

49:18.122 --> 49:19.624
... accommodate me with a drunk?

49:19.624 --> 49:23.127
You know where the door
darling. No one safe.

49:25.463 --> 49:28.466
<i>I know that the
to see us together, people will say ...</i>

49:28.466 --> 49:32.136
<i>How can this woman
Elegant want that good-natured fat?</i>

49:32.971 --> 49:35.056
<i>I'm not a fat
natured. As you can see ...</i>

49:35.056 --> 49:36.266
<i>... I lost weight too.</i>

49:36.307 --> 49:40.645
<i>Yes, but ... Well! Not that
is very beautiful to look at.</i>

49:40.812 --> 49:43.481
<i>- I'm nice!
- Yes, this is clear.</i>

49:43.481 --> 49:46.734
<i>And  kind, talented
and charming.</i>

49:46.734 --> 49:49.570
<i>This is my pen. I
a lover with grades ...</i>

49:49.570 --> 49:51.656
<i>... of a husband.</i>

50:08.339 --> 50:10.925
Well, let me think.

50:10.925 --> 50:14.345
You do not have curves,
but it is attractive and fun.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.265
Such Romain-Ville.
Very good family.

50:17.265 --> 50:19.183
Much cult
that bastard there.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.602
- You will learn more than just horses.
- Who are they?

50:21.602 --> 50:25.023
But it is a little dizzy.
There is also a duke, ...

50:25.023 --> 50:27.692
... a little older,
but not manly.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.569
I want to work.

50:29.610 --> 50:33.364
I want to make a living.
I would like to be an actress.

50:33.448 --> 50:35.700
You're a bit old
to start.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.870
And work.
What a surprise!

50:38.703 --> 50:42.123
But you're famous.
Knows many people.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.750
I'm sure
you can get me something.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.501
Let me see ...

50:45.543 --> 50:47.128
What did you do before
of living with Balsan?

50:47.128 --> 50:49.213
He did nothing.
Sewed.

50:49.464 --> 50:51.799
That you could only
do in Paris.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.470
There is no madness.
You have talent.

50:56.471 --> 50:59.056
I told you that the girls
here love their hats?

50:59.640 --> 51:01.434
You could work
a headgear.

51:01.476 --> 51:03.728
I do not like it!

51:03.978 --> 51:06.230
You want something,
but do not know what.

51:06.230 --> 51:08.316
Emilienne, help me!

51:08.983 --> 51:11.152
You said it would Balsan
away?

51:12.653 --> 51:15.072
Well, come back to the castle.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.825
If he asks you, tell him
I asked you to come.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.328
Invent something, but not
you say you wanted to leave.

51:20.328 --> 51:22.413
'm Telling the story.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.749
Do not judge so, Coco.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.585
Balsan is easy to take.
You're lucky.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.504
Enjoy what you have.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.923
Luck?

52:10.628 --> 52:12.713
Good morning.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.717
Hungry?

52:17.051 --> 52:18.678
<i>Muffins.</i>

52:18.719 --> 52:23.057
Do not know anything, but
for the English is "turn-eyes."

52:23.891 --> 52:26.060
Well, Boy, where are the
five ships of coal ...

52:26.060 --> 52:28.145
that made me buy
last month?

52:27.770 --> 52:31.899
Why, I remember you, if I
remember correctly, we go to war.

52:31.899 --> 52:35.528
Yes, I hope so. Can I resell
them the price of gold.

52:35.528 --> 52:36.612
Negotiates with coal?

52:36.612 --> 52:38.948
I believe that Mr. Capel
what would be,

52:38.948 --> 52:42.952
since that was the greatest man
business in England. Right?

52:43.953 --> 52:46.747
So sell me ships.
For that you paid so much.

52:46.747 --> 52:49.292
Were it not for their advice,
I would be working ...

52:49.292 --> 52:51.335
... today with
my poor wife.

52:51.335 --> 52:54.964
It Moleur! You
enough to climb it!

52:55.006 --> 52:57.049
Work.
What verb so horrible!

52:57.049 --> 52:59.010
It is the worst form of
live life.

52:59.010 --> 53:01.304
Sure, but is most
tiring.

53:01.304 --> 53:03.389
Mr. Parton is here.

53:04.932 --> 53:08.102
The creator of Cardiff arrived.
Do not let us wait.

53:08.102 --> 53:10.062
- Are you coming?
- Coming.

53:10.062 --> 53:10.896
I count on you.

53:10.896 --> 53:12.940
Because my English
is Poorly.

53:12.940 --> 53:16.277
And I want the Heart of
Darkness. I want that horse.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.446
So, not alarmed.

53:18.446 --> 53:24.535
She has an ease
terrible to disappear.

53:48.017 --> 53:51.228
I was afraid
never to see you.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.238
You are not happy here?

54:01.739 --> 54:03.365
You should go.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.951
Balsan is waiting and it seems
you are indispensable.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.703
Why not
answer my question?

54:07.703 --> 54:09.955
If I had to answer
to all who ask me ...

54:12.583 --> 54:14.960
You work even
or just pretending?

54:15.878 --> 54:17.087
What do you think?

54:17.087 --> 54:19.006
Here nobody works.

54:19.006 --> 54:20.925
Maybe I would have liked
pretend, but ...

54:20.925 --> 54:23.552
... the truth is that
I do not have to lie.

54:23.594 --> 54:29.850
My mother was missing something
for my father to marry her.

54:30.476 --> 54:35.189
The aristocratic touch, as
they say in France.

54:36.816 --> 54:39.610
I was not raised by my parents.

54:42.238 --> 54:44.698
Do not make that face!

54:44.698 --> 54:48.953
Did not seem unhappy
have been so? Of ever ...

54:48.953 --> 54:52.957
... have opened or read a book. Neither
have traveled, not knowing anything?

54:54.667 --> 54:57.670
What then perhaps you
liked better.

55:24.238 --> 55:25.364
You are too harsh!

55:25.364 --> 55:28.534
You asked me a
fantasy of an orphan.

55:28.033 --> 55:31.203
What do you mean?
An orphan English to see

55:31.203 --> 55:33.330
... so poor that
is getting undressed.

55:34.248 --> 55:36.166
- Open a little dress.
- No.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.751
Please.

55:37.751 --> 55:40.462
You are a donkey. Would
to show a little ...

55:40.462 --> 55:41.964
... more muscles, breasts.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.550
It is much more
provocative suggest.

55:45.301 --> 55:48.178
- It's stubborn as a mule, eh?
- Gabrielle?

55:53.976 --> 55:55.894
- Que bonita!
- Thank you.

55:55.894 --> 55:58.022
How happy I am
to see you!

55:58.230 --> 56:01.025
- How am I?
- Sober.

56:01.358 --> 56:05.571
I do not want to be sober.
Is a disaster!

56:21.754 --> 56:24.214
- I underestimated you again?
- I did not want to fight back.

56:24.214 --> 56:26.759
Manure continues
the same.

56:29.094 --> 56:30.471
Coco!

56:30.471 --> 56:31.722
Help me. I
walking weird.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.266
No! Is moving
  naturally.

56:34.266 --> 56:37.978
I feel that is falling
everything and I need to be tight.

56:37.978 --> 56:41.106
Why do you want to go with
something that prevents it from breathing?

56:54.411 --> 56:56.622
Its beautiful pirate?

57:09.051 --> 57:11.136
Hello!

57:16.934 --> 57:20.729
Captain John Racker.
What can I do for you?

57:22.314 --> 57:24.399
Nothing.

57:28.737 --> 57:31.031
I do not believe
to be happy.

57:31.448 --> 57:34.034
The only thing that
I lack is a job.

57:35.619 --> 57:38.330
You could offer me
something with so much coal!

57:37.955 --> 57:40.958
And it's not much that can
make a woman?

57:40.999 --> 57:42.459
Yes, nothing to say ...

57:42.459 --> 57:43.877
... that is a man
despite other.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.879
To impress him?

57:45.879 --> 57:48.173
Who do you take me?

57:54.012 --> 57:57.516
Who hid,
the animal ate!

58:05.274 --> 58:08.068
Ah
A girl!

58:19.871 --> 58:21.957
Again!

58:25.127 --> 58:27.212
<i>Marveilleux</i>

58:28.714 --> 58:31.341
  Bravo!

59:03.623 --> 59:06.585
What did you do in the bedroom?
Everything is silent.

59:07.336 --> 59:10.339
You should see all mad
with your dress orphan.

59:12.674 --> 59:17.137
- Have you ever fallen in love?
- Ah, never worked.

59:17.137 --> 59:19.723
But how?

59:19.931 --> 59:23.310
What do you feel? Feels good?
If you feel bad? How?

59:23.852 --> 59:27.147
Where did you leave?

59:28.273 --> 59:30.150
How to fall in love?

59:30.150 --> 59:33.695
It ... It's horrible.
Awful. Awful!

59:37.282 --> 59:39.326
What are you doing?

59:39.326 --> 59:41.119
I'm going.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.205
What nonsense.
Enjoy a little.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.790
I have nothing
what to do here.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.501
Sure.
Balsan account with you.

59:47.501 --> 59:49.711
You know very well
because I'm here.

59:49.878 --> 59:54.883
How? Still midnight.
Wait at least for morning.

59:54.883 --> 59:57.135
Good night, Gabrielle.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:05.644
Stay a while.

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:10.690
Why should I?

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:18.448
Come! Come!
Come! Out!

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:21.368
Let us all!

1:01:24.431 --> 1:01:28.435
I'm not used to
undressing boys.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:16.650
Look who's here!

1:02:20.445 --> 1:02:23.865
C'mon, let
coffee.

1:02:25.367 --> 1:02:29.037
- Where is your eye patch?
- I lost the battle.

1:02:29.037 --> 1:02:33.875
My friend, you do not know
as we well!

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:36.544
Emilienne was furious.
He bit an employee.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:40.048
He saw Coco by chance? Will
who hid too?

1:02:40.048 --> 1:02:41.800
I do not find it.

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:47.055
- It disappears forever?
- There is something recent.

1:02:47.055 --> 1:02:49.182
You feel something for her?

1:02:49.182 --> 1:02:52.185
Since when interest
you what I feel?

1:02:52.185 --> 1:02:54.270
Since yesterday.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:59.150
I tell you that it is a
companion fantastic, lovely.

1:02:59.150 --> 1:03:02.404
Mind you that I
take her for two days?

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:05.115
It pleases him so?

1:03:06.658 --> 1:03:08.743
I like.

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:14.541
- She'll go with you?
- I think so.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:22.090
Then it's quiet.
You can take it.

1:04:11.681 --> 1:04:13.766
Thank you.

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:58.394
I never
seen the sea.

1:05:05.234 --> 1:05:08.196
See? She put
all jewelry.

1:05:11.949 --> 1:05:16.371
You see? Is so tight
it will split in two.

1:05:21.042 --> 1:05:24.420
Look at them! With all these
meringues in the head.

1:05:25.088 --> 1:05:27.590
We seem
a pastry.

1:05:29.676 --> 1:05:33.137
- Sometimes I'm ashamed to speak evil.
- You are an anarchist.

1:05:33.137 --> 1:05:37.433
- I feel a real aversion.
- This phrase is not his.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:39.894
It Jules Renard.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.814
See? I've read other books.

1:05:44.816 --> 1:05:48.236
Tonight we
dance in the Casino.

1:05:49.362 --> 1:05:51.364
Will not bother you
see us?

1:05:51.364 --> 1:05:53.449
- What things do you think!

1:05:54.117 --> 1:05:56.536
I did not bring clothes
appropriate for this.

1:05:56.828 --> 1:06:00.998
Because the rule is to be dressed
to be more elegant.

1:06:00.998 --> 1:06:05.294
What would a color that
escape really a color?

1:06:09.048 --> 1:06:10.633
Are perfect.

1:06:10.633 --> 1:06:14.804
I also have a very mauve
beautiful fabric.

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:16.806
I think it would be better.

1:06:16.806 --> 1:06:19.976
No, only the black
emphasizes the look.

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:28.067
- And I want this income.
- Okay.

1:06:28.067 --> 1:06:31.362
What about the neckline, I want
download the 10 cm.

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:33.239
And, above all, nothing
seams.

1:06:33.239 --> 1:06:35.283
But seamless dress
be released.

1:06:35.283 --> 1:06:38.035
Let him
have at least one belt.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:43.291
- Do as I say.
- Exactly.

1:07:16.073 --> 1:07:18.492
All women
look at you.

1:07:18.492 --> 1:07:20.870
All women
look is for you.

1:08:35.403 --> 1:08:37.488
You're beautiful!

1:09:33.461 --> 1:09:36.964
I have you
when I get back!

1:09:52.563 --> 1:09:55.566
Do not leave without
say hello ...

1:09:57.234 --> 1:09:59.612
Is your car running?
I?

1:09:59.612 --> 1:10:01.697
Yes, of course.

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:13.125
- It's amazing.
- Beware! You'll end up liking.

1:10:20.758 --> 1:10:24.678
How was the trip?
You have fun?

1:10:24.678 --> 1:10:29.892
What did? I thought
you were very busy.

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:33.771
- Worried?
- No, not worried.

1:10:34.396 --> 1:10:38.317
And as for me,
I've been good.

1:10:40.861 --> 1:10:44.531
Although it is not apparent,
is a very fragile.

1:10:44.531 --> 1:10:47.785
So do not mess with it.

1:10:48.410 --> 1:10:50.496
I know.

1:10:51.288 --> 1:10:53.374
I surprised?

1:11:02.132 --> 1:11:04.218
Etienne!

1:11:05.010 --> 1:11:08.639
Am I only have
grow.

1:11:09.056 --> 1:11:11.141
Beautiful fabric
huh?

1:11:12.434 --> 1:11:15.771
You making hats.
I look at you.

1:11:16.230 --> 1:11:19.274
The living image of
a happy couple.

1:11:20.776 --> 1:11:23.988
Who knew that you were
spend two days with another man?

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:28.784
You like the Deauville?

1:11:29.243 --> 1:11:32.496
Yes, especially
sea.

1:11:32.496 --> 1:11:36.667
- What did you do?
- We dance in the Casino.

1:11:36.917 --> 1:11:39.336
And he did not feel
shame on me.

1:11:39.336 --> 1:11:41.672
If you were in England,
I also would have taken you ...

1:11:41.672 --> 1:11:43.632
Buckingham Palace.

1:11:43.632 --> 1:11:46.343
Last night, the beach
were fishing.

1:11:46.343 --> 1:11:50.681
How wonderful those men
blue and the brightness of the fish.

1:11:51.181 --> 1:11:54.935
One day you come with me
see what is real fish.

1:11:54.935 --> 1:11:57.563
What do you know?
He never left his castle.

1:11:57.563 --> 1:11:59.732
You are wrong.
I love the sea.

1:11:59.773 --> 1:12:03.861
Not long ago, fished
a shark ...

1:12:03.861 --> 1:12:06.280
... an old boat
England.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:08.615
No way.

1:12:09.366 --> 1:12:11.452
Oh, no?

1:12:11.702 --> 1:12:15.497
- Ask him.
- When Boy?

1:12:15.497 --> 1:12:18.751
Four years.
Exactly.

1:12:18.751 --> 1:12:20.836
And how was it?

1:12:22.755 --> 1:12:26.133
It was not pretty,
but he had something.

1:12:26.133 --> 1:12:28.635
No. You do not.
Him

1:12:28.635 --> 1:12:31.472
Irresistible!
Course.

1:12:33.056 --> 1:12:35.184
We morriis
of jealousy, because ...

1:12:35.184 --> 1:12:38.479
robbed us of all lovers.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:42.024
But always with great flair.

1:12:42.149 --> 1:12:45.360
That's what disgusts
charm in English.

1:12:45.861 --> 1:12:47.946
Elegance.

1:12:49.114 --> 1:12:52.326
- He came to fall in love?
- No.

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:57.080
But they did.
The emphasis was terrible.

1:12:57.498 --> 1:13:00.125
It was heartbreaking
everywhere.

1:13:00.125 --> 1:13:01.752
France, England.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:04.671
Finally, in all those
places where there March

1:13:06.173 --> 1:13:10.385
Not know why, but
when it moves,

1:13:10.385 --> 1:13:14.056
... he takes them there.

1:13:13.889 --> 1:13:16.475
How strange, no?

1:13:17.476 --> 1:13:22.940
- Are you jealous?
- Terribly.

1:13:49.216 --> 1:13:51.718
Gabrielle?
What are you doing here?

1:13:52.052 --> 1:13:55.222
- I had to see you.
- Enter.

1:14:00.102 --> 1:14:02.896
Well, what you have
to tell me?

1:14:02.896 --> 1:14:04.564
Remember that
the Chambre d'Amour, Blanche, ...

1:14:04.564 --> 1:14:06.775
... legend,
travels the world on foot?

1:14:06.775 --> 1:14:09.027
For love of the prince?

1:14:10.487 --> 1:14:12.572
Exactly.

1:14:12.739 --> 1:14:16.034
- You? Really?
- It's terrible ...

1:14:16.034 --> 1:14:19.538
I do not know what is happening to me.
I am an idiot!

1:14:21.623 --> 1:14:25.168
- I would like to get married.
- Gabrielle!

1:14:27.462 --> 1:14:31.341
- And the parents agree?
- It will be done anyway.

1:14:32.092 --> 1:14:34.177
You're lucky.

1:14:34.511 --> 1:14:36.972
You are more beautiful
than ever.

1:14:39.391 --> 1:14:41.893
For my parents
it even want to know me.

1:14:42.185 --> 1:14:44.271
I am a late life,
live to tell.

1:14:44.354 --> 1:14:46.606
Well, wait to die.

1:14:58.410 --> 1:15:00.579
We're almost there.

1:15:01.371 --> 1:15:03.457
Care.

1:15:07.794 --> 1:15:09.880
It is for you.

1:15:12.007 --> 1:15:14.092
But it is the love of your life.

1:15:14.551 --> 1:15:16.636
Exactly.

1:15:26.605 --> 1:15:28.899
I can not accept
Snow White.

1:15:29.191 --> 1:15:31.443
Oh yes yes.

1:15:32.402 --> 1:15:34.488
I'm leaving.

1:15:38.533 --> 1:15:42.037
Sorry, is that ...
I think free because ...

1:15:42.037 --> 1:15:44.831
... I who put
the fox in the henhouse.

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:46.166
I thought you
was tired of ...

1:15:46.166 --> 1:15:47.793
my mood swings.

1:15:47.793 --> 1:15:49.252
You should not
precipitate.

1:15:49.252 --> 1:15:51.171
What kind of animal bit you?
When I was here ...

1:15:51.171 --> 1:15:53.256
... you kept me
locked.

1:15:55.759 --> 1:15:58.011
A perfect idiot.

1:16:02.599 --> 1:16:08.855
This is your home.
Go live in England?

1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:12.526
I think so.

1:16:12.609 --> 1:16:15.779
- Do not you know?
- There or wherever.

1:16:17.113 --> 1:16:22.369
- In health and disease.
- Yes, more or less.

1:16:22.410 --> 1:16:24.204
It hurts, does not believe?

1:16:24.204 --> 1:16:26.706
It ... normal.

1:16:28.375 --> 1:16:32.879
- This will pass.
- Yes, of course.

1:16:34.714 --> 1:16:36.967
I lie.
No?

1:16:39.678 --> 1:16:42.264
I do not want
you go.

1:16:42.264 --> 1:16:45.559
I'm afraid. Fear
that you are unhappy.

1:16:45.725 --> 1:16:48.395
What you see,
suddenly, nothing.

1:16:48.395 --> 1:16:53.191
- How so?
- It should be the one to tell you.

1:16:53.191 --> 1:16:56.695
Boy is getting married.
With an English.

1:16:56.695 --> 1:16:58.780
That's nonsense.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:03.034
There is a marriage
convenience.

1:17:03.034 --> 1:17:05.870
He is a bastard and she
is very rich. His father has ...

1:17:05.870 --> 1:17:07.789
... half of the mines
coal from England.

1:17:07.789 --> 1:17:09.874
Sorry, Coco.

1:17:12.210 --> 1:17:13.545
I am very puzzled
suddenly ...

1:17:13.545 --> 1:17:16.923
... you had become
a gentleman!

1:17:34.482 --> 1:17:38.737
Coco! Open.

1:17:40.238 --> 1:17:42.782
Open, please.

1:17:44.284 --> 1:17:48.163
Coco, forget what he said.

1:17:50.623 --> 1:17:56.880
Coco, I'm sorry.
Open!

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:35.752
Coco?

1:18:41.716 --> 1:18:45.220
Small mismatches
darling!

1:18:45.345 --> 1:18:47.931
I present Sophie,
works in Poly.

1:18:47.931 --> 1:18:49.390
Hello

1:18:49.390 --> 1:18:51.559
You can not believe that
someone trapped in a castle ...

1:18:51.559 --> 1:18:53.353
... one who makes me
hats.

1:18:53.353 --> 1:18:54.813
She is willing to
spend a fortune ...

1:18:54.813 --> 1:18:55.939
... for you to do one.

1:18:55.939 --> 1:18:58.024
It gave many
hopes.

1:18:58.733 --> 1:19:00.902
We brought some models
just in case.

1:19:00.902 --> 1:19:02.987
Here they are.

1:19:03.571 --> 1:19:05.657
Then.
What do you think?

1:19:12.372 --> 1:19:14.499
We are in the stables.
Come.

1:19:15.208 --> 1:19:17.085
Coming.

1:19:17.085 --> 1:19:19.420
Take your time.

1:20:15.727 --> 1:20:18.980
Good morning, Gabrielle.

1:20:24.610 --> 1:20:26.904
How is your country?

1:20:27.196 --> 1:20:32.076
You could say that's great,
green and gray, and rainy.

1:20:36.497 --> 1:20:38.624
What are you thinking?

1:20:39.250 --> 1:20:41.336
In my sister.

1:20:42.587 --> 1:20:44.756
You are a
very old woman.

1:20:44.756 --> 1:20:46.841
For what purpose?

1:20:47.216 --> 1:20:51.220
She keeps thinking
your going to marry Baron.

1:20:52.013 --> 1:20:57.602
If you wish, you may not
need to get married.

1:21:00.104 --> 1:21:02.940
Yet
everyone home.

1:21:05.068 --> 1:21:08.196
In general, love
has nothing to do with it.

1:21:08.613 --> 1:21:13.034
Marriage is just
a social convention.

1:21:16.954 --> 1:21:19.665
So why believe
Balsan asked me to marry him?

1:21:19.665 --> 1:21:22.418
- Do not take him seriously?
- Why not?

1:21:23.169 --> 1:21:25.880
I have a status.

1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:34.347
If you marry
him ...

1:21:34.347 --> 1:21:36.390
... would give
everything?

1:21:36.390 --> 1:21:40.686
You refer to ride a horse
and entertain the guests?

1:21:41.604 --> 1:21:43.314
No.

1:21:43.314 --> 1:21:46.359
Gabrielle, an exceptional future
waiting for you.

1:21:46.359 --> 1:21:48.277
You and your idioms!

1:21:48.277 --> 1:21:52.240
You're different.
You have to trust yourself.

1:21:54.325 --> 1:21:57.745
Anyway, not
I intend to marry.

1:22:01.624 --> 1:22:04.877
I always knew that
is the wife of one.

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:11.467
Even yours.

1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:17.640
And I am what you see:
oblivion.

1:22:20.184 --> 1:22:22.562
See. My mother was
a fool.

1:22:22.562 --> 1:22:24.689
He married for love.

1:22:27.275 --> 1:22:32.613
She spent her days crying.
My father always mistaken.

1:22:34.866 --> 1:22:38.536
Night after sleepless night.
Waiting for him.

1:22:41.956 --> 1:22:48.087
One morning, when he returned,
found her lying

1:22:51.007 --> 1:22:53.134
... dead.

1:22:56.387 --> 1:22:59.390
Thus, it is better to be lover
the wife.

1:23:01.475 --> 1:23:04.729
The worst wedding
is the couple.

1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:08.065
Are you surprised?

1:23:17.867 --> 1:23:19.952
I'm getting married.

1:23:23.289 --> 1:23:25.374
Congratulations.

1:23:36.927 --> 1:23:39.013
Nothing will change between us.

1:23:40.890 --> 1:23:42.975
Of course yes.

1:24:26.727 --> 1:24:28.813
It will not play?

1:24:46.539 --> 1:24:48.624
Look at her!

1:24:50.167 --> 1:24:52.253
I go to Paris.

1:24:52.461 --> 1:24:54.547
And what will you do in Paris?

1:24:54.630 --> 1:24:56.715
I already told you.
I'll make a fortune.

1:24:57.091 --> 1:25:02.179
And you can know that great
idea will bring rich and famous?

1:25:02.179 --> 1:25:05.307
- I design hats.
- Excellent idea,

1:25:05.307 --> 1:25:09.103
... but that you can do here.
Pay you what you miss.

1:25:09.103 --> 1:25:12.606
If you make a couple of hats for
her friends, I have no fortune.

1:25:12.606 --> 1:25:14.692
You thought seriously
to work, huh?

1:25:14.692 --> 1:25:17.111
It is absurd? What do you think?

1:25:19.363 --> 1:25:22.324
I think is right.

1:25:23.784 --> 1:25:26.829
It may be that in England,
they make the women work.

1:25:26.829 --> 1:25:31.250
But here we still
something gallant.

1:25:32.751 --> 1:25:35.546
- And if you know how to add 2 + 2?
- But you will learn.

1:25:35.546 --> 1:25:38.591
No money. No
thought about it?

1:25:39.466 --> 1:25:42.511
I'll get.
I'll borrow.

1:25:43.721 --> 1:25:45.556
Should not put these
ideas in her head.

1:25:45.556 --> 1:25:48.392
It will not take it
nowhere.

1:25:53.272 --> 1:25:55.649
We could get married.

1:25:55.649 --> 1:25:58.402
Would be the solution
all their problems.

1:25:58.444 --> 1:26:00.195
You could do many
how many hats he wanted.

1:26:00.195 --> 1:26:03.032
I would face even
my family of barbarians.

1:26:12.291 --> 1:26:15.711
I have no intention
I married one.

1:26:22.009 --> 1:26:24.470
At least, you are direct.

1:26:46.492 --> 1:26:50.871
The money you need ...

1:26:51.789 --> 1:26:54.792
Who will give me.

1:26:56.460 --> 1:26:58.587
I'll take you
to ruin.

1:26:59.463 --> 1:27:01.715
I give you.

1:27:23.487 --> 1:27:25.114
Ready.

1:27:25.114 --> 1:27:27.741
You're leaving me.

1:27:30.119 --> 1:27:32.204
You will see me?

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:40.129
I miss you.

1:27:41.964 --> 1:27:44.049
Me too.

1:27:46.385 --> 1:27:48.971
What will I do without you?

1:27:53.016 --> 1:27:55.227
I'm afraid.

1:28:54.202 --> 1:28:56.288
Adrienne!

1:28:58.624 --> 1:29:01.919
Wow! A gentleman!

1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.766
Ahab you.

1:29:54.429 --> 1:29:57.307
How easy undress you!

1:30:21.748 --> 1:30:24.543
- Until now.
- Stay here.

1:30:24.543 --> 1:30:26.753
Hats Part Emilienne
are not finished.

1:30:26.753 --> 1:30:28.922
Small compared
their hats.

1:30:28.964 --> 1:30:31.633
If you were less
I talk more.

1:30:34.261 --> 1:30:36.763
- Oh, no!
- For your place.

1:30:55.449 --> 1:30:57.534
I think I found
home.

1:30:57.784 --> 1:30:59.911
- Where?
- Near here.

1:31:00.162 --> 1:31:03.707
Not far from the sea.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:31:03.707 --> 1:31:05.542
Oysters are to
you?

1:31:05.542 --> 1:31:07.627
Miss.

1:31:11.798 --> 1:31:13.091
We can rent it
for two months.

1:31:13.091 --> 1:31:15.844
Two months?
I can not believe.

1:31:16.678 --> 1:31:19.014
I do not know.
Let's stop.

1:31:19.014 --> 1:31:21.516
I'll take my chances.

1:31:26.188 --> 1:31:28.690
This is your hat?

1:31:35.697 --> 1:31:38.325
I pay
the rent.

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:40.368
I thought you gave
a rocket ...

1:31:40.368 --> 1:31:42.287
and gave you freedom.

1:31:42.287 --> 1:31:45.290
If I had expected, you
married to a celebrity.

1:31:45.415 --> 1:31:48.084
And not with the daughter of the owner
of an old castle.

1:31:48.585 --> 1:31:51.171
And we would have been happy.

1:31:51.463 --> 1:31:54.424
Did not we happy?

1:31:59.387 --> 1:32:01.640
- Come on, you go.
- No, not think.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:03.266
Yes I need
your opinion.

1:32:03.266 --> 1:32:05.352
Come. Take the wheel.

1:32:29.501 --> 1:32:30.669
Freie.

1:32:30.669 --> 1:32:32.754
Freie!

1:32:33.254 --> 1:32:35.340
Freie we beat.

1:32:36.883 --> 1:32:38.218
Not bad!

1:32:38.218 --> 1:32:40.929
You need a well,
but driver.

1:32:40.929 --> 1:32:42.806
I'll buy.

1:32:42.806 --> 1:32:43.890
Wait for the next month.

1:32:43.890 --> 1:32:46.476
I do not know if we will have
enough money in the bank.

1:32:46.726 --> 1:32:47.894
How so?

1:32:47.894 --> 1:32:51.439
Is the money in the account
I won, right? Mine!

1:32:51.439 --> 1:32:52.899
But if the bank lends
the money to you ...

1:32:52.899 --> 1:32:55.026
... is why I endorse.

1:32:55.026 --> 1:32:58.321
- So I depend on you?
- For now.

1:33:08.081 --> 1:33:09.666
Gabrielle.

1:33:09.666 --> 1:33:13.294
Starting tomorrow, I'll take care
accounts and talk to the bank.

1:33:15.463 --> 1:33:18.591
The proud people feed
their own suffering.

1:33:18.591 --> 1:33:20.677
What you want from me?

1:33:21.344 --> 1:33:26.015
You are too proud.
Will suffer.

1:33:28.685 --> 1:33:31.229
The work of the body relieves
the heartaches ...

1:33:31.229 --> 1:33:34.733
... and that is what makes
the poor happy.

1:33:34.691 --> 1:33:38.778
Poor happy! This is
an invention of the rich.

1:33:39.988 --> 1:33:43.908
That's it! You are
  ready to read Nietzsche.

1:33:46.202 --> 1:33:48.705
You wove me
blue shirt?

1:33:50.623 --> 1:33:53.460
Know the difference between
you and me?

1:33:53.460 --> 1:33:56.337
I am a man
and you a woman ...

1:33:56.337 --> 1:33:59.174
... and men and women
not dress the same.

1:34:01.843 --> 1:34:04.012
You had to rob me
not?

1:34:04.554 --> 1:34:05.972
Only found
England.

1:34:05.972 --> 1:34:10.435
- What is done?
- It's a jersey.

1:34:11.769 --> 1:34:13.855
You are impossible!

1:34:19.235 --> 1:34:20.737
Help me!

1:34:20.737 --> 1:34:23.781
If not, I do not
leave more.

1:35:01.027 --> 1:35:04.280
Well, here we are!
Let's go.

1:35:04.322 --> 1:35:06.699
- Seriously, I have to go.
- So, rev.

1:35:06.699 --> 1:35:09.786
I am tired of
see you go.

1:35:09.786 --> 1:35:11.871
Then I go with you.

1:35:11.996 --> 1:35:14.082
This is your
traveling clothes?

1:35:16.459 --> 1:35:19.420
Tomorrow I'm back. Then
have two months.

1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:21.506
Only two of us.

1:35:21.673 --> 1:35:25.468
Sixty days and
sixty nights.

1:35:50.368 --> 1:35:53.746
You will not regret
has not taken me.

1:36:22.442 --> 1:36:25.194
<i>Ah, do not make me spend saliva.
I know what you'll tell me.</i>

1:36:25.194 --> 1:36:26.446
<i>What  I let
wiggle me.</i>

1:36:26.446 --> 1:36:27.530
<i>Well, yes!
Yes</i>

1:36:27.530 --> 1:36:28.740
<i>You left
that wiggle on you.</i>

1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:32.160
<i>See? I knew it! Also
know what's next.</i>

1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:34.120
<i>Now that I'm going
behave as one creates ...</i>

1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:36.289
<i>... 2 minutes and call me
of nasty e. ..</i>

1:36:36.289 --> 1:36:38.332
<i>... 5, will break
something.</i>

1:36:38.332 --> 1:36:41.002
<i>the way, I recommend
this small jug.</i>

1:36:41.002 --> 1:36:43.004
<i>Almost  you dropped there
one and a half ...</i>

1:36:43.004 --> 1:36:44.630
<i>... back to the party
public school.</i>

1:36:44.630 --> 1:36:47.592
<i>But if you do not hang,
can do it in pieces.</i>

1:36:49.677 --> 1:36:53.806
<i>And now, to the end, the better.
So do not fall into monotony.</i>

1:36:53.806 --> 1:36:56.517
<i>... - For a change.
- Enough! Do not get me out of serious</i>

1:36:56.517 --> 1:36:58.853
<i>- Enough! Stop talking.
- Now comes the "disgusting".</i>

1:36:58.853 --> 1:37:00.188
<i>Asquerosa</i>

1:37:00.188 --> 1:37:02.356
<i>- You behaved ...
- ... as one creates.</i>

1:37:02.565 --> 1:37:03.149
<i>Exactly.</i>

1:37:03.149 --> 1:37:07.987
<i>You  denigrated the honorable
surname of my family.</i>

1:37:07.987 --> 1:37:09.947
<i>What a pity!
Instead, ...</i>

1:37:09.947 --> 1:37:12.033
<i>... would
a complaint.</i>

1:37:14.452 --> 1:37:16.329
What's happening?

1:37:16.329 --> 1:37:18.956
You're almost done.
Outside is better.

1:37:19.165 --> 1:37:22.502
<i>... on the container in question,
if not told what to think,</i>

1:37:22.502 --> 1:37:25.630
<i>... is because I was swept along
by certain considerations,</i>

1:37:25.630 --> 1:37:27.298
<i>... you to know you</i>

1:37:27.298 --> 1:37:30.134
Theater bother me too much.

1:37:32.011 --> 1:37:35.014
- Why cut your hair?
- Me bothered.

1:37:35.932 --> 1:37:39.602
You know what they say? What a
woman who cuts hair ...

1:37:39.602 --> 1:37:42.730
... is a woman who is
about to change his life.

1:37:52.323 --> 1:37:55.785
- I would dine with me?
- I would love.

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:58.246
Let.

1:38:02.750 --> 1:38:05.836
Boy had a car accident.

1:38:07.296 --> 1:38:09.382
He is in hospital?

1:45:36.328 --> 1:45:38.497
In 60-year career, Coco Chanel
drew thousands of models that ...

1:45:38.497 --> 1:45:40.874
... defined the modern woman.

1:45:53.929 --> 1:45:56.098
She put the biggest celebrities
of the time.

1:45:56.098 --> 1:45:58.600
It was the first woman who stood out in
world of men, founding ...

1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:00.227
... an empire that still bears
your name.

1:46:00.227 --> 1:46:01.603
She never married.

1:46:01.603 --> 1:46:03.313
She worked until his death,
one night January 1971.

1:46:03.313 --> 1:46:05.774
It was a Sunday, the day
of rest, the day she hated.

1:46:07.859 --> 1:46:12.030
