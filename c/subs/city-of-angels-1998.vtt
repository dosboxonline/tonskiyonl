00:22.731 --> 00:24.023
I don't...

00:24.191 --> 00:25.775
I don't really pray...

00:26.068 --> 00:28.986
...but if you could just
help me out here...

00:29.321 --> 00:30.530
...I promise...

00:33.701 --> 00:35.284
105.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.286
105?

00:37.621 --> 00:39.330
Oh, my God! Okay.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.416
Okay, run a bath, call the doctor.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.043
Just run a bath, get her into the bath.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.379
Dr. Carter, 655...

00:46.630 --> 00:48.089
Oh, he won't be there.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.799
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.594
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.805
Susan. Susie.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.725
Mommy needs you to get up now.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.561
- Cold.
- I know, I know.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.229
Okay, hang on.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.813
Hang on.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.232
Cold!

01:06.400 --> 01:09.026
It just feels cold because you're so hot.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.488
Susan. Susan, stay with me. Susan.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.740
Susan!

01:16.994 --> 01:19.036
Has she been disoriented? Confused?

01:19.204 --> 01:22.665
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.962
Are you cold?

01:30.466 --> 01:32.175
Okay, swing it.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.385
- Move it, people.
- Is Room 2 clear?

01:34.595 --> 01:35.803
Yes, it's clear.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.680
Get her pressure.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.433
- Let's give her O2. Ten liters.
- Yes, doctor.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.143
Tap her right away.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.069
How's her breathing?

02:14.593 --> 02:16.093
No pulse or rhythm.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.096
Are you God?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.308
No.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.684
My name is Seth.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.478
Where are we going?

02:25.687 --> 02:27.230
Home.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.816
Can Mommy come?

02:30.359 --> 02:31.776
No.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.286
She won't understand.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.330
She will...

02:44.498 --> 02:46.123
...someday.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.716
Can I ask you something?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.385
Yes.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.179
What did you like best?

03:01.390 --> 03:03.182
Pajamas.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.003
She definitely knew what she liked.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.715
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.884
Pajamas.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.553
Excellent choice. What else?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.723
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

03:43.891 --> 03:47.685
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

03:47.853 --> 03:50.855
...but it made her turn and look at him
in such a way...

03:52.441 --> 03:54.275
And they?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.861
- Yes.
- Ah.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.946
It was a good day.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.741
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.492
Touch?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.411
No.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.538
Yes, you do.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.626
Occasionally. Yes.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.378
Touch.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.524
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.486
Blue eyes. He's never going to leave her.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.490
Twenty minutes.
Everything in this damn city is 20 minutes.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.408
It's never 20 minutes.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.892
My ass on a stool all day.
She gets the good chair.

05:11.812 --> 05:16.524
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.788
$20,000 at 21 percent.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.000
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.418
Oh, shit!

05:35.669 --> 05:40.089
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.299
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

05:57.441 --> 06:00.776
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.903
They all want wings.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.197
I never know what to say.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.324
Tell them the truth.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.368
Angels aren't human.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.662
We were never human.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.583
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

06:15.751 --> 06:17.710
Tell her the truth.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.879
I told her.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.464
And?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.466
How did she take it?

06:23.967 --> 06:28.554
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

06:54.498 --> 06:57.500
On the 101
through downtown L.A., no delays...

06:58.835 --> 07:00.544
Shit! Jesus!

07:02.714 --> 07:04.757
Get to work!

08:09.573 --> 08:10.906
What do we got?

08:11.074 --> 08:15.286
50-year-old male had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.664
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.416
He's hypertensive.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.959
This diagonal looks tight.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.712
Who cathed him?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.755
Rosenberg.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.050
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.773
He's pretty out of it.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.569
The doctor's here.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.304
- We're just going to cool to 32 today.
- Okay.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.723
Sucker.

09:20.435 --> 09:21.852
Jimi.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.370
Vein.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.886
Kid started walking.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.389
Three unassisted steps.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.226
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.604
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.776
Retrograde on.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.573
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.450
Down to half flow, here's your volume.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.244
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.495
Let's come off.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.955
We're coming down.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.375
We're clamped and off bypass.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.650
Oh, shit.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.361
What are you missing?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.238
Sponge.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.198
Bummer.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.205
Got it!

11:11.296 --> 11:12.713
Thank you, everybody.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.965
Presbyterian's on Line 2.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.426
Watch his rhythm.
It's gonna be irritable.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.058
- She's getting good, huh?
- She's getting that attitude too.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.893
Getting an attitude?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.688
Aw, shit! V-tac!

11:29.898 --> 11:31.398
Christ! Paddles!

11:31.608 --> 11:33.442
Kill the music. Get her back in here.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.944
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.447
- Go, go, go.
- Dr. Rice.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.656
Two hundred.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.910
- Ready.
- Clear.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.330
- Ready.
- Clear!

11:46.498 --> 11:47.831
V-fib, no pressure.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.917
- You give him lidocaine?
- 100's gone in.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.543
Buzz him again at 300.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.712
- Three hundred.
- Clear.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.547
- Nothing.
- Start compression.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.383
Kill the alarm!

12:01.596 --> 12:03.180
Hold up. It's not working.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.974
Gotta open him.
How long to go back on?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.601
It'll take me 10 minutes.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.603
Come on. Nothing.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.188
Knife.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.281
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.409
- Ready.
- Twenty.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.119
Hit it.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.122
- Nada.
- Go to 30.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.998
- Thirty.
- Hit it.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.875
No response.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.836
Tom, I gotta get back on bypass here.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.963
Almost there. Give me 7 more minutes.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.048
Come on. Come on.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.760
Don't do this. Come on.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.138
He's going.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.557
He's not going anywhere.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.735
Come on, don't do this! Come on.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.531
Damn it, come on!

13:04.159 --> 13:05.242
Tom.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.122
Come on! Come on.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.587
Tom. Come on.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.811
Mrs. Balford?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.314
Where's the doctor?

13:36.900 --> 13:39.026
- I'm the doctor.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.362
I operated on your husband.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.281
How is he?

13:46.826 --> 13:47.868
He didn't survive.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.414
What?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.294
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

13:57.462 --> 14:00.923
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia.
We were unable to resuscitate him.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.927
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

14:08.556 --> 14:09.598
I'm sorry.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.852
But... But...

14:14.354 --> 14:15.854
Do you...?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.940
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm...

14:18.149 --> 14:20.359
- What did you say?
- He's...?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.446
What?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.616
Oh, my God.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.418
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.314
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.108
I'm sorry.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.946
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

15:06.114 --> 15:09.074
A graft occlusion? What?

15:10.451 --> 15:13.036
It was textbook. It was textbook.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.670
I'm so sorry.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.716
The room got so big.
I was so small.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.051
How did I get so small?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.596
I should've gone back on.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.973
I should've massaged longer.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.226
I should've gone back on.
I massaged longer. I lost it.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.564
I lost it.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.835
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.503
You're looking at me.

16:04.088 --> 16:08.216
No, not by me,
and not by the dying or the delirious.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.178
Have you ever been seen...

16:11.679 --> 16:13.889
...like you were a man?

16:14.557 --> 16:19.061
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

16:19.228 --> 16:21.730
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.026
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.529
That doctor, in the operating room...

16:31.366 --> 16:33.492
...she looked right at me.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.328
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.498
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.124
And if I want her to?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.752
Why do you want her to?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.339
To help her.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.007
Open it!

16:49.175 --> 16:50.592
Open it now!

16:51.177 --> 16:52.469
Everybody down!

16:52.679 --> 16:53.720
Get down!

16:54.597 --> 16:56.348
Do it! Do it!

16:56.557 --> 16:58.392
Shit! Just give him the money.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.269
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.438
I should have gone to Ralphs.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.483
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

17:07.902 --> 17:09.736
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.530
I'll never see my grandkids again.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.200
What am I doing?

17:15.742 --> 17:17.993
Just be cool. Be cool.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.333
Be cool, man.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.544
Be cool.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.008
Holy shit.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.804
They don't need to see us.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.867
Hey, you're early.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.859
What's going on?

18:31.027 --> 18:33.403
Ferris was looking for you.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.197
Maggie.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.293
- What's going on? I have a mitral valve to do.
- They canceled it.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.087
- Who canceled it?
- Sheffield.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.714
Why are you telling me?

18:52.924 --> 18:53.924
He was busy.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.467
He was chickenshit.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.719
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.554
You're sick and you can't operate.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.516
They've rescheduled for Monday.
It's elective. No big deal.

19:02.683 --> 19:07.020
It is unprofessional and it embarrasses me
in front of my staff.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.068
I saw the chart on Balford.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.654
- What?
- I'm on the committee. It's on review.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.281
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.950
Then what's the problem?

19:24.205 --> 19:25.455
I don't know.

19:25.623 --> 19:29.417
Maggie, you put up a terrific fight.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.711
Yeah.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.755
We fight for people's lives, right?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.674
Uh-huh.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.135
Don't you ever wonder
who it is we're fighting with?

19:43.850 --> 19:47.143
- So I'm crazy and I'm chemically imbalanced.
- You're tired.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.938
You have moments.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.899
Why didn't you call me?

19:55.611 --> 19:57.654
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.906
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.410
You're good.

20:03.578 --> 20:04.870
You know it.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.497
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.166
Doctor?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.425
I'll see you.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.161
"...shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."

20:46.329 --> 20:48.747
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea..."

20:49.040 --> 20:51.666
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

20:51.959 --> 20:54.628
...probably cannot be said."

20:56.797 --> 20:59.090
"Not knowing how to react to
this confinement...

20:59.258 --> 21:02.510
...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once exposed...

21:02.678 --> 21:05.597
...through her recognition
of external realities."

21:07.516 --> 21:09.142
"Commencing search."
Searching my soul.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.354
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.731
She's been looking at me
for the last half-hour.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.316
Maybe if I just hang here...

21:16.484 --> 21:20.862
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense..."

21:21.030 --> 21:25.158
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

21:26.369 --> 21:28.495
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man..."

21:28.663 --> 21:30.580
"I had three chairs in my house..."

21:30.748 --> 21:33.708
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

21:33.876 --> 21:38.421
...as you knew the river would flow again
after it was frozen.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.425
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

21:42.593 --> 21:48.098
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason."

22:23.134 --> 22:26.052
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.595
What happened yesterday?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.431
They had a golf tournament.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.224
Who knows with these people?

22:31.392 --> 22:32.767
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.104
The "G" is soft, like "messenger."

22:38.149 --> 22:39.149
What is on your lip?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.985
What? Am I slobbering here?

22:47.074 --> 22:49.784
- Where did you get that?
- What am I, a prisoner?

22:49.952 --> 22:52.996
You wanna get well
or you want Ben & Jerry's?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.539
This operation is a big deal.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.500
Continue to eat in this manner...

22:57.668 --> 23:00.045
...you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.466
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

23:04.633 --> 23:08.011
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

23:08.763 --> 23:11.389
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

23:11.599 --> 23:15.810
Hey, I ain't "the procedure." My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.528
Miss, can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

23:26.280 --> 23:28.156
Okay, to the left? Yeah, okay.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.064
Hello, hello, hello...

24:45.776 --> 24:48.570
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

24:49.488 --> 24:51.865
Do you know the Muffin Man

24:52.032 --> 24:54.200
The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

25:37.995 --> 25:39.537
Maggie.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.498
- Hi, Anne.
- What are you doing here?

25:43.167 --> 25:44.792
I was on my way up to X-Ray...

25:45.085 --> 25:47.754
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

25:48.422 --> 25:49.505
...hide.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.466
From what?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.261
I should've gone into pediatrics.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.888
Oh, no.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.724
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.770
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.149
Poor little guy.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.736
Yeah, okay.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.821
He never stops crying.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.824
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.828
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.289
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

26:23.457 --> 26:26.292
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.628
May I?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.714
Yeah.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.934
Did you do an ultrasound?

26:43.143 --> 26:44.852
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.062
Yeah.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.274
Okay, baby. Yes.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.028
So, what are you hiding from?

26:56.073 --> 26:57.865
My patient's wife.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.869
She wants me to tell her
that her husband is gonna be okay...

27:02.204 --> 27:04.831
...that I have every confidence...

27:05.666 --> 27:06.874
...and I don't.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.253
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

27:10.462 --> 27:12.839
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

27:14.341 --> 27:17.427
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

27:18.429 --> 27:22.181
And if it isn't...
If it isn't, what do I do with that?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.283
Excuse me.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.501
Are you a visitor?

28:33.253 --> 28:34.253
Yes.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.007
Well, visiting hours have been over
since 8:00.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.593
Why do they have that?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.805
- What?
- Hours.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.016
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

28:49.478 --> 28:51.270
Who are you visiting? Mr. Messinger?

28:51.522 --> 28:53.064
Right now?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.899
Yeah.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.403
You.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.574
I don't need a visitor.

29:03.826 --> 29:04.992
You're not ill?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.244
No.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.248
I'm one of the doctors here.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.627
Are you in despair?

29:19.383 --> 29:21.509
I lost a patient.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.886
You did everything you could?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.890
I was holding his heart in my hand
when he died.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.810
Then he wasn't alone.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.395
Yes, he was.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.813
People die.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.022
Not on my table.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.859
People die when their bodies give out.

29:38.068 --> 29:41.612
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.739
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.575
I wanted him to live.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.910
He is living.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.829
Just not the way you think.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.505
I don't believe in that.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.925
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.179
How did you know my name?

30:10.726 --> 30:11.726
What's yours?

30:14.021 --> 30:18.900
Seth.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.698
You better get out of here, Seth...

30:25.866 --> 30:28.951
...or Security's gonna think
you're a psych patient.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.359
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.403
Suction.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.031
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand

31:49.199 --> 31:51.284
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

31:51.785 --> 31:56.372
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

31:57.207 --> 32:01.752
No dying now, Mr. Messinger.
Not until you give me Seth's phone number.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.881
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand

32:06.049 --> 32:07.925
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

32:35.746 --> 32:38.039
Those eyes.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.041
The way he looked...

32:40.542 --> 32:42.752
...right down into me.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.505
Seth.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.343
What kind of name is "Seth"?

34:49.045 --> 34:50.463
Hey.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.632
I thought you'd be here.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.010
Salty.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.929
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.390
You okay?

35:01.558 --> 35:02.600
Yeah.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.566
You might wanna return this.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.574
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring."

35:18.742 --> 35:20.576
How did you know that?

35:20.786 --> 35:23.662
What are you talking about?
I didn't give you this book.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.083
You didn't?

35:28.585 --> 35:29.919
Where'd you get it?

35:41.765 --> 35:45.017
Hi. I'm a physician and I think
a patient left that in my office.

35:45.268 --> 35:48.270
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.481
I can tell you when.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.235
- Okay.
- All right, give me 5 minutes.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.685
Hello, Maggie.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.355
It's nice to see you again.

36:31.982 --> 36:33.524
It's weird to see you again.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.569
Weird is nice.

36:39.573 --> 36:41.198
You like Hemingway?

36:41.366 --> 36:44.326
Yeah. Yeah, I'm starting to.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.458
- May I?
- Yeah.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.589
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

36:56.798 --> 36:58.924
...and their faint metallic taste...

36:59.467 --> 37:01.802
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

37:02.053 --> 37:05.097
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

37:05.307 --> 37:07.266
...I lost the empty feeling...

37:07.475 --> 37:09.435
...and began to be happy."

37:10.270 --> 37:12.771
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.108
I like that.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.237
Do you come here a lot?

37:20.906 --> 37:22.197
I live here.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.242
What do you do?

37:25.535 --> 37:26.535
Read.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.038
No, I mean, ha, ha, your work.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.749
I'm a messenger.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.003
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

37:36.463 --> 37:38.881
No, I'm a messenger of God.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.217
Got a message for me?

37:43.303 --> 37:44.803
I already gave it to you.

37:45.013 --> 37:49.099
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

37:50.226 --> 37:53.479
You've definitely been beeped.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.900
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.027
The operation went really well.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.780
- It was a good day.
- It was.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.324
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.411
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

38:09.579 --> 38:10.704
I have a feeling.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.248
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.250
Close your eyes.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.630
It's just for a moment.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.944
What am I doing?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.906
You're touching me.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.492
Touch.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.620
How do you know?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.373
Because I feel it.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.342
You should trust that.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.761
You don't trust it enough.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.568
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

39:22.736 --> 39:23.736
I don't care.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.196
What do you want to do?

39:26.990 --> 39:28.532
Anything.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.662
What's that like?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.417
What's it taste like?

40:20.585 --> 40:22.252
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.965
Well, it tastes like, um...

40:27.675 --> 40:28.884
...a pear.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.179
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.973
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.815
Sweet...

40:42.982 --> 40:44.775
...juicy.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.946
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

40:49.155 --> 40:52.407
...like sugary sand
that dissolves in your mouth.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.704
How's that?

41:00.375 --> 41:02.459
It's perfect.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.270
The first time I looked in a microscope...

41:21.437 --> 41:24.064
...that's when I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.111
Okay, let me have your hand.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.988
What for?

41:31.197 --> 41:32.948
We'll take a look at your blood.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.742
Not a possibility.

41:36.786 --> 41:40.289
Oh. Ha, ha. Men.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.875
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

41:43.126 --> 41:45.335
...is nine times higher than a man's.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.637
Okay, take a...

41:56.139 --> 41:58.140
Take a look at that.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.395
That's bright.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.360
That's me.

42:11.154 --> 42:12.154
All those cells.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.365
That's all you are.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.912
That and all the space in between.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.248
If this is all you are...

42:23.499 --> 42:25.250
...these cells...

42:26.169 --> 42:28.420
...then when they die, that's the end.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.965
I don't know. I think so.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.469
How do you explain it?

42:35.637 --> 42:37.054
What?

42:38.223 --> 42:40.390
The enduring myth of heaven.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.856
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.233
But you didn't?

42:49.651 --> 42:54.238
No.

42:56.157 --> 43:00.118
Because something happened.
Something happened in my OR and I got...

43:00.620 --> 43:04.122
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

43:04.582 --> 43:08.126
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...

43:09.754 --> 43:12.047
Does that sound crazy?

43:12.215 --> 43:13.507
No.

43:14.676 --> 43:17.386
Because I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

43:17.637 --> 43:19.888
...and I couldn't fix him.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.849
That's not supposed to happen.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.478
And I...

43:27.105 --> 43:28.605
And you cried.

43:31.693 --> 43:33.110
Yeah.

43:34.904 --> 43:37.990
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

43:38.700 --> 43:41.201
I mean, what happens physically?

43:42.078 --> 43:44.830
Well, um...

43:44.998 --> 43:48.583
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

43:48.835 --> 43:52.129
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.090
Why? Why do they overact?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.552
I don't know.

43:59.429 --> 44:00.846
Maybe...

44:01.306 --> 44:03.307
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

44:03.558 --> 44:05.434
...your body just can't contain it.

44:05.685 --> 44:09.354
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.481
Your body weeps.

44:17.572 --> 44:18.655
I have to go.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.325
I gotta go. Stay right here.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.076
Don't go anywhere.

44:23.286 --> 44:25.370
Stay right there.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.351
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.436
It's because the tube is blocked.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.367
How you feeling?

45:03.534 --> 45:05.369
Ready to hit the waves.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.538
Well, I'm afraid your bodysurfing days are over.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.377
You got a mean tattoo going there.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.796
What does your wife think of that?

45:15.963 --> 45:17.756
That is my wife.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.430
Okay.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.601
Check his vitals every 15.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.204
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.088
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.842
Not yet.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.705
Where have you been?

46:32.415 --> 46:34.791
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.293
Dinner?

46:37.044 --> 46:39.588
- With who?
- Well, he's a...

46:40.131 --> 46:41.673
Uh...

46:41.841 --> 46:44.718
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

46:44.969 --> 46:47.053
Did you pack my backpack?

46:47.638 --> 46:48.763
What else?

46:48.931 --> 46:51.641
Well, we talked...

46:51.809 --> 46:53.810
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.353
Why did you pack my backpack?

46:55.771 --> 46:57.481
Earl, what are you doing?

46:57.732 --> 47:00.484
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

47:00.693 --> 47:01.985
...maybe do a little hiking.

47:03.613 --> 47:04.696
What?

47:07.533 --> 47:09.534
God. Is it?

47:09.744 --> 47:10.994
Maggie, it's just a tick.

47:11.454 --> 47:14.331
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

47:14.582 --> 47:16.541
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

47:16.751 --> 47:19.836
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.087
I don't have any.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.590
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

47:23.758 --> 47:25.467
Well, how about some olive oil?

47:25.635 --> 47:27.802
Okay. All right.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.679
Which kind? JalapeÃ±o or rosemary?

47:30.473 --> 47:31.890
Rosemary.

47:33.142 --> 47:36.895
So, what did you and your friend...?
What did you say his name was?

47:38.564 --> 47:39.564
Seth.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.400
What did you two talk about?

47:43.402 --> 47:44.694
Dying.

47:47.073 --> 47:50.867
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

47:51.077 --> 47:54.871
I hope you're not gonna become
one of those surgeons who prays in the OR.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.172
Can we talk for a minute?

48:04.382 --> 48:05.674
We'll talk while camping.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.301
No, Jordan, I can't go camping now.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.262
We need to spend some time together.

48:10.471 --> 48:14.015
Okay. All right, let's see if we can
just spend five minutes.

48:14.267 --> 48:17.477
Let's see if we can just stand still
for five minutes and be together.

48:18.354 --> 48:19.354
Doing what?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.856
Just being here.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.026
- I'll get the trail map.
- No. No, no.

48:25.194 --> 48:26.319
No, I mean it.

48:26.779 --> 48:28.154
Nothing but us.

48:31.534 --> 48:32.826
What am I supposed to do?

48:34.287 --> 48:35.704
Just look at me.

48:47.800 --> 48:52.512
You can't do it.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.390
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

49:09.864 --> 49:12.991
That old black magic called

49:13.242 --> 49:15.076
Love

49:15.578 --> 49:17.203
Thank you very much.

49:17.455 --> 49:21.207
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.086
You want to watch anything?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.175
Me neither.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.560
How do you know when I'm here?

49:46.275 --> 49:47.567
I know.

49:49.779 --> 49:51.404
Jeez, you look good.

49:52.531 --> 49:56.284
I forgot how good everybody looked.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.622
Thirty years of silence.

50:00.873 --> 50:04.626
You got guts, kid, showing yourself like that.
I appreciate that. I do.

50:04.877 --> 50:06.294
It's gonna make it easier.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.923
I gotta tell you, I feel fine.

50:10.174 --> 50:14.135
You might want to check your orders
because I sure don't feel like I'm dying.

50:14.345 --> 50:15.637
You're not dying.

50:15.846 --> 50:19.265
Oh, right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

50:19.517 --> 50:22.018
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

50:23.312 --> 50:24.813
Unless...

50:28.317 --> 50:29.984
Could it be...

50:31.070 --> 50:32.362
...the doctor?

50:33.906 --> 50:35.281
Sure.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.075
The doctor.

50:37.827 --> 50:39.661
Oh, she's pretty.

50:39.912 --> 50:41.496
A little flat-chested...

50:41.747 --> 50:43.581
...but all you need's a handful.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.959
- Who are you?
- This is good.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.461
This is what they call...

50:48.713 --> 50:50.880
..."serendipitous."

50:51.132 --> 50:54.592
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.762
Thank you. Thank you, okay?

51:00.516 --> 51:01.933
Okay.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.769
You ready to deal?

51:05.271 --> 51:08.106
Because I can answer
all your questions, friend.

51:18.033 --> 51:19.701
How's the French toast this evening?

51:19.869 --> 51:20.869
Fabulous.

51:21.036 --> 51:22.245
Well, set me up.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.881
Guess I should introduce myself.

51:33.549 --> 51:35.049
Come on, give me your hand.

51:36.844 --> 51:39.220
Put it in mine. There you go.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.431
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.224
No, that's too much.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.643
There you go. Good grip.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.104
Nathaniel Messinger.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.148
Glutton, hedonist...

51:50.399 --> 51:54.736
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.283
I don't believe you.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.826
You want proof?

52:02.328 --> 52:04.162
You hang out at a library.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.206
You can speak every language.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.374
You travel with the speed of thought.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.627
And you're reading
my mind right now.

52:11.045 --> 52:12.045
Stop that.

52:12.338 --> 52:13.463
You're doing it.

52:15.216 --> 52:16.382
It's impossible.

52:16.801 --> 52:19.844
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

52:22.389 --> 52:24.098
How?

52:24.266 --> 52:25.558
- You choose.
- Choose?

52:25.810 --> 52:27.435
To fall to Earth.

52:27.686 --> 52:30.647
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.941
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

52:33.192 --> 52:36.110
You just make up your mind to do it
and you do it.

52:39.240 --> 52:42.367
You wake up all smelly
and aching from head to toe...

52:42.576 --> 52:44.410
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

52:44.578 --> 52:48.122
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

52:48.374 --> 52:52.377
...so it's all real confusing and painful,
but very, very good.

52:55.339 --> 52:56.756
Human.

52:58.259 --> 52:59.509
Listen, kid:

53:00.970 --> 53:04.055
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.558
You think he didn't give it to us too?

53:06.767 --> 53:07.767
Which gift?

53:08.352 --> 53:09.978
Free will, brother.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.814
Free will.

53:40.342 --> 53:41.926
Couldn't get a job.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.345
No past, no training.

53:44.597 --> 53:46.097
No ID.

53:46.891 --> 53:50.268
Then one day,
I was walking past a building site.

53:50.519 --> 53:51.936
A skyscraper.

53:52.187 --> 53:54.814
And I thought, "I could do that."

53:55.065 --> 53:56.983
You see, these people down here...

53:57.234 --> 54:00.278
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

54:00.529 --> 54:03.740
That makes me uniquely qualified.

54:04.325 --> 54:08.077
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

54:08.329 --> 54:09.704
And I like what I do.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.122
I'm good at it.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.877
These things'll kill you.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.005
Are there others?

54:19.715 --> 54:21.299
Others like you?

54:21.675 --> 54:23.176
Yeah, they're out there.

54:23.636 --> 54:27.555
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

54:27.973 --> 54:31.768
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

54:32.353 --> 54:34.020
Then why'd you do it?

54:43.405 --> 54:45.031
My daughter, Ruth...

54:45.282 --> 54:47.158
...her stupid husband, Frank...

54:47.743 --> 54:49.202
...and my grandkids.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.955
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

54:55.292 --> 54:58.503
And this is my wife, Teresa.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.548
Did you...

55:03.509 --> 55:05.176
...tell her who you were?

55:06.178 --> 55:08.763
I started to try once or twice.

55:09.181 --> 55:11.099
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

55:11.350 --> 55:12.642
Do what?

55:13.227 --> 55:15.019
It's too much for them.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.731
People don't believe in us anymore.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.535
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

55:31.078 --> 55:32.996
And sunset, yes.

55:34.456 --> 55:36.249
Take me there?

55:47.219 --> 55:49.137
Can you hear it?

55:59.690 --> 56:00.690
No.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.294
I can't hear that!

56:21.503 --> 56:23.921
But you can't feel this!

56:24.423 --> 56:25.757
Nathan!

56:32.931 --> 56:34.223
You have to go back.

56:34.475 --> 56:36.601
Not until I catch the big wave.

56:40.939 --> 56:43.900
Wait.

56:44.151 --> 56:45.610
Wait for what?

56:46.779 --> 56:47.904
Swim!

57:23.690 --> 57:25.691
And then you just...

57:26.151 --> 57:27.276
...fall.

57:27.861 --> 57:29.403
- Fall?
- Dive.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.490
You make up your mind to do it...

57:33.492 --> 57:34.951
...and you do it.

57:35.494 --> 57:37.787
And when you wake up, you're?

57:38.455 --> 57:39.831
Yes.

57:42.126 --> 57:44.001
To smell the air.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.962
Taste water.

57:46.213 --> 57:47.421
Read a newspaper.

57:47.631 --> 57:50.049
- To lie.
- Through your teeth.

57:50.717 --> 57:51.717
To feed the dog.

57:54.638 --> 57:55.972
Touch her hair.

57:58.517 --> 58:00.476
What are you waiting for?

58:05.649 --> 58:08.317
There is so much beauty up here.

58:10.028 --> 58:11.529
Yes.

58:36.430 --> 58:37.638
Here you are again.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.100
We're releasing your friend tomorrow.

58:41.268 --> 58:42.518
That's good.

58:42.769 --> 58:46.147
His family's having
a kind of a welcome-home party.

58:46.607 --> 58:48.024
Are you?

58:49.276 --> 58:52.737
Will you be going?

58:55.574 --> 58:56.574
This is Earl.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.117
He told me.

58:59.244 --> 59:00.494
What else does he tell you?

59:00.704 --> 59:04.665
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

59:05.417 --> 59:08.461
Sometimes I think Earl's
the only one who understands me.

59:08.712 --> 59:09.921
What about your boyfriend?

59:10.380 --> 59:11.714
Do you love him?

59:14.718 --> 59:16.052
Love? I don't know.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.637
What does that mean?

59:18.555 --> 59:20.640
I was hoping you could tell me.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.726
Well, it's a word...

59:23.977 --> 59:26.646
...that describes a chemical react...

59:28.232 --> 59:30.900
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

59:32.819 --> 59:36.197
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

59:36.448 --> 59:38.115
...and I don't even know you.

59:38.617 --> 59:40.368
What do you want to know?

59:42.371 --> 59:44.330
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time?

59:44.498 --> 59:46.540
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

59:47.626 --> 59:48.793
Are you married?

59:49.503 --> 59:50.544
No.

59:51.421 --> 59:52.421
Are you homeless?

59:54.007 --> 59:55.174
No.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.385
Are you a drummer?

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.308
Why don't you ever touch me?

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.398
I don't want to hurt you.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:14.402
You won't hurt me.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.386
Did you feel that?

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.193
If I could make you understand...

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:00.906
I understand.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.204
I'll see you around.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.687
Hey, doc!

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.693
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.404
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.988
You look great.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:25.825
Is this heaven?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.743
Look at this.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.791
Come on, let's meet some people.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.668
You got an appetite?

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.674
Have a beer, Seth.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.509
Where you from?

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.761
Up.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.597
- North. Uh, ahem, Canada.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.856
Listen. Can you hear?

01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:59.275
I'm growing.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:00.985
Smile, Hannah.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.490
Oh, how cute.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.037
How long have you known Seth?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.332
Not very long.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.128
But I feel like I've known him forever.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.214
Honey, that hurts.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.051
You're just like Grandpa.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.305
Come on.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.557
Let's see if the cookies are done.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:32.850
Come on, Seth.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:35.311
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:41.984
How did you two meet?

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.489
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:48.782
I thought he was a messenger.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.911
Yeah, he's one of those...

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.162
..."hyphenates."

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.748
I'll be right back.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.391
Seth, Seth.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.727
Hey.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.289
Here, can you cut this up?

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:47.049
So in what province is it in Canada
were you born?

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.885
I wasn't born in Canada.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:55.849
What are your parents' names?

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:06.026
No parents.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.953
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.705
I'm not a construction worker.

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:20.207
Very pale hands. Let me see.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.547
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.756
No.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:30.843
What's your last name?

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:32.261
You know my last name.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:33.721
No, I don't.

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.057
Plate.

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:38.934
Seth Plate?

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:51.071
I cut you.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:56.785
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.121
Not the way you do.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.249
The way I do?
What does that mean?

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:06.128
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:07.755
The way...

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:10.049
...a human does.

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.969
I have no sense of touch.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.221
You feel that?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:18.182
You don't have to be frightened.

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:19.725
You freak!

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.143
You liar!

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.604
Who... What are you?

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.397
I came to take Mr. Balford...

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:28.692
...and I saw you.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.613
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.282
How you fought for him.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.286
And you looked right at me...

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.622
...like I was a man.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.084
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:49.296
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.757
I was there in the stairwell...

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:54.426
...when you cried for your patient.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:57.596
And I touched you. Remember?

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.641
Why are you doing this?

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.353
Because I'm in love with you.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.904
I don't believe you.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.906
Do you feel that?

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.077
You don't want to believe me.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.705
I cannot conceive of it!

01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:26.125
- Maggie.
- Just get out!

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.378
Get out!

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.429
Doctor?

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.767
Doctor?

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:12.523
Hello?

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.613
Seth?

01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:25.577
Are you here?

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.094
I wanna see you.

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:28.640
Let me see you.

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.755
Just stay.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.635
Just stay until I fall asleep.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.882
Oh, yes!

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.136
Thank you.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:09.116
- Maggie.
- Hey.

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:11.201
- The baby can't sleep.
- What?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.745
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:16.707
I don't know. Let's check him out.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.004
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.050
Choanal atresia.

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.761
There's hardly any air getting through.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:31.388
How did you know?

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.225
I just...

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.186
...knew!

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:05.130
Maggie?

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.423
Yeah.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:08.216
Are you alone?

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.010
Yeah.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.308
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:18.018
Think so?

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.021
I couldn't have done it better.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.024
Well, that's a compliment.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:39.831
What are you doing?

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.625
I'm spending time with you.

01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:46.797
Will you marry me?

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.882
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:50.634
Get married on the Nevada side...

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.136
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.266
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:13:59.726
What do you want me to say?

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.771
We belong together.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.606
We're the same species.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:08.235
- Jordan...
- I'm not...

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:15.117
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.702
...the proverbial heart.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:21.873
Please be my wife.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.584
Just...

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:27.587
Just think about it.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.147
Breathe in.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.193
Breathe in.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.791
I'm good.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:17.095
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.433
He didn't tell you.

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:26.646
Tell me what?

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.565
Maybe you should ask him.

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:31.484
No, I'm asking you.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.456
Seth knows no fear...

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:45.999
...no pain...

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:47.709
...no hunger.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.755
He hears music in the sunrise.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.508
But he'd give it all up.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.177
He loves you that much.

01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:01.932
I don't understand.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:06.728
He can fall.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.689
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:13.026
He can give up eternity and become...

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.361
...one of us.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:17.322
It's up to you.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.450
How do you know this?

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.041
Because I did it.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:17:00.907
Seth?

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.580
Seth, I need to talk to you.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:13.628
Seth, please.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.425
Please be here.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.262
Oh, God, help me through this.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.650
You are so beautiful.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.988
You'll always be that way.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.826
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:47.037
...and get married.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.291
He knows me.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.169
He knows the demands of my work.

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:56.796
You don't love him.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.424
He and I are the same.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.887
And I want that.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:10.894
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.272
But you can feel me.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.274
You felt me.

01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:20.195
I want to say goodbye.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.948
I don't want to see you again.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.382
Yoo-hoo!

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.358
Hey. Hey, buddy.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:29.110
You can't be in here.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:34.741
Do you see me?

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.326
Can you see me?

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:37.744
Oh, yeah. We can see you.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.537
Your invisible drug wore off.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.247
Is this blood?

01:22:41.415 --> 01:22:42.415
This is blood!

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:43.833
Is it red?

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:45.627
Red?

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.545
Is it red?

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:49.964
Color.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.550
What color were the drugs you took?

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:55.136
Better get your butt out of here.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:56.971
You got somewhere to go?

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:08.191
Maggie.

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:17.200
Down and down and down I go

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:19.702
Round and round and round I go

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.080
Round and spin

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:24.499
Loving the spin I'm in

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.335
Loving that old black magic

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:29.587
Called love

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.965
Love!

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.468
Hi!

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:40.181
Hello.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:48.231
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.068
Can I help you, sir?

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.113
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:39.699
Breath!

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:43.536
Maggie Rice.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:46.497
Are you a patient?

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.541
No. I just need to find her, please.

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:51.586
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:53.087
Do you know where she is?

01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.840
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:00.803
You have this computer...

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.348
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.267
Anne!

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.604
Where's Maggie?

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.986
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.781
What happened to you?

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.115
Sorry.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:22.658
It's okay.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:26.996
I fell.

01:25:27.498 --> 01:25:30.166
Evidently. Off a train?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.710
I fell in love.

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:38.466
Anne?

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.677
Please help me find her.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:50.269
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:51.562
Wait!

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.846
Cassiel.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.056
Are you there?

01:26:35.566 --> 01:26:36.816
Hello.

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:33.456
Where you headed?

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:35.666
Tahoe!

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.169
Reno!

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:39.587
Tahoe!

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.631
I'm going to Reno.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.382
I'm going to Tahoe.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:46.302
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.132
Earl?

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.649
Am I too late?

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:07.902
Too late?

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:09.945
Jordan?

01:30:14.367 --> 01:30:16.827
I couldn't marry Jordan.

01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:21.665
I'm in love with you.

01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:31.133
What happened?

01:30:34.096 --> 01:30:35.930
Free will.

01:30:50.654 --> 01:30:52.655
I feel you.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:12.902
Do you feel that?

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.570
Yes.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.907
And that?

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:24.914
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:27.082
I can't.

01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:30.211
Try.

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:33.130
Warm.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.095
Aching.

01:32:57.656 --> 01:32:59.323
It's okay.

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:03.035
We fit together.

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:04.828
I know.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.623
We were made to fit together.

01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:31.689
I always asked the dying
what they liked best about living.

01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:36.485
Wrote it down in my book.

01:33:38.697 --> 01:33:40.281
This is it.

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:43.617
This is what I like best.

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:46.704
You haven't even started yet.

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:49.707
We have our whole lives together.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:51.166
You and me.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:53.585
Mr. And Mrs. Plate.

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:33.102
Hey.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.628
Maggie.

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:29.671
Seth.

01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:31.798
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:34.009
- Stay.
- I should get help.

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.303
Don't go. The driver went.

01:39:36.512 --> 01:39:37.846
Please stay.

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:40.682
Please stay with me.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.309
I'm scared.

01:39:47.023 --> 01:39:49.524
- I screwed up.
- No.

01:39:49.942 --> 01:39:51.818
I wanted to show you everything.

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:53.487
You will.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:40:00.661
You came all this way.

01:40:01.245 --> 01:40:03.038
I'm sorry.

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:05.791
Oh, God, no, Maggie.

01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:08.293
To touch you...

01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:09.628
...and to feel you.

01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:13.840
To be able to hold your hand right now.

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:15.217
You know what that means?

01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:18.679
Do you know how much I love you?

01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:24.976
Keep looking at me, okay?

01:40:26.354 --> 01:40:28.105
Look right in my eyes.

01:40:30.066 --> 01:40:32.901
- Someone's out there.
- Maggie.

01:40:33.778 --> 01:40:37.280
Don't look at them.
Please, Maggie, no, don't you look at them.

01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:39.825
Is this what happens?

01:40:46.124 --> 01:40:47.457
Yes.

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.133
This is what happens.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:01.847
I'm not afraid.

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:07.811
When they ask me...

01:41:09.522 --> 01:41:11.356
...what I liked the best...

01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:14.484
...I'll tell them...

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.653
...it was you.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.934
God!

01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:53.894
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.898
I'm sorry.

01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:02.485
Get out.

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:04.613
Seth.

01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.407
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:09.367
No.

01:44:10.119 --> 01:44:11.369
Why did he do this?

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:12.662
I don't know.

01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:14.080
Because her number was up?

01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:17.000
What do you want me to say?

01:44:24.634 --> 01:44:28.136
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

01:44:29.472 --> 01:44:31.181
That's life.

01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:34.684
You're living now.

01:44:35.978 --> 01:44:37.479
And one day...

01:44:37.647 --> 01:44:39.272
...you'll be dying.

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:46.821
What's it like?

01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:49.366
What?

01:44:50.201 --> 01:44:51.201
Warmth.

01:44:53.496 --> 01:44:55.330
It's wonderful.

01:44:56.999 --> 01:44:59.709
If you'd known this
was going to happen...

01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:02.212
...would you have done it?

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:10.845
I would rather have had...

01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:14.391
...one breath of her hair...

01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:19.854
...one kiss of her mouth...

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:25.026
...one touch of her hand...

01:45:26.696 --> 01:45:29.406
...than an eternity without it.

01:45:31.867 --> 01:45:33.410
One.
