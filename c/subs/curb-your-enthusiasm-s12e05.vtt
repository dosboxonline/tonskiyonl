WEBVTT

00:12.962 --> 00:16.007
So I needed a new lawyer,
and Susie was going on and on

00:16.007 --> 00:17.465
about what a great lawyer you are.

00:17.465 --> 00:19.844
And then, the coup de gras,
she told me your last name.

00:19.844 --> 00:22.263
Mantle. Christopher Mantle.

00:22.263 --> 00:25.765
Oh my God. I mean Mickey Mantle,
he was my idol growing up.

00:25.765 --> 00:28.059
I don't follow baseball, but I know
who Mickey Mantle is.

00:28.059 --> 00:29.520
Oh my God, it's an amazing name.

00:29.895 --> 00:32.106
Susie's great at connecting everybody.
I love her.

00:32.106 --> 00:34.816
By the way, she mentioned
you might be going to the temple

00:34.816 --> 00:36.234
for the reopening of the plaza thing.

00:36.234 --> 00:40.405
I'm being dragged there by this woman
who I'm connected to somehow.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.949
- I'm being dragged there, too.
- Really?

00:42.949 --> 00:44.410
Yeah, my husband is Jewish.

00:44.410 --> 00:47.955
We're both being dragged.
Look at that.

00:47.955 --> 00:50.666
So, I familiarized myself with the case,

00:50.666 --> 00:53.169
like the rest of America,
and listen to me, Larry.

00:53.169 --> 00:56.129
This is the most unconstitutional law
that's ever been passed.

00:56.129 --> 00:58.341
The law should be on trial,
not you.

00:58.341 --> 01:01.676
So I'm confident this will get
cleared up quickly.

01:02.094 --> 01:03.929
And I'll file something by the end
of the week,

01:03.929 --> 01:06.140
which is the cutoff date to file
a motion to dismiss.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.183
So all will be taken care of.
You can rest easy.

01:08.183 --> 01:10.478
Oh my God, that is music to my ears.

01:10.478 --> 01:13.898
We're gonna avoid a trial,
and it's gonna be tossed out.

01:13.898 --> 01:17.817
Mr. Mantle.
You just hit a home run. You know?

01:17.817 --> 01:19.695
That's fantastic.

01:19.695 --> 01:24.158
So the good news is I can still parade
around like I'm a hero of sorts

01:24.657 --> 01:27.702
without having to go to trial,
or prison, or anything.

01:27.702 --> 01:30.538
You will not have to go to trial.
You will not be going to prison.

01:30.538 --> 01:32.208
Mr. Mantle, Denise on line one.

01:32.208 --> 01:33.750
One second. Sorry.

01:34.293 --> 01:35.919
Hello? Yeah.

01:37.170 --> 01:41.842
Really? Oh, that's great.
Can you put that back, Larr?

01:41.842 --> 01:45.136
Yeah, it's great. Thank you so much,
Denise. Okay, bye.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.930
Sorry about that.
That was my surrogate.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.807
My husband and I are having a baby.

01:48.807 --> 01:52.060
Congratulations.
Big news. That's great.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.062
- We're really excited.
- You like the surrogate?

01:54.062 --> 01:55.355
I do. She's really sweet.

01:55.355 --> 01:58.442
She took an IQ test?
You don't want to get a moron, right?

01:58.442 --> 02:01.946
- You're sure she's not a moron?
- Yes. Thank you for your concern.

02:01.946 --> 02:04.656
Let me ask you a question. How does
it work with a gay couple?

02:04.656 --> 02:06.409
Who gets to choose the last name?

02:06.409 --> 02:09.912
We had a discussion,
and we chose my husband's name.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.247
- Which is?
- Zeckelman.

02:15.917 --> 02:19.005
You're going with Zeckelman
over Mantle?

02:19.005 --> 02:21.005
Is there something wrong
with his last name?

02:21.005 --> 02:23.800
It's not the greatest last name
in the world,

02:23.800 --> 02:26.012
but Mantle is one of the great names.

02:26.012 --> 02:30.807
Well, thank you. I personally think
Zeckelman is also a great name.

02:32.726 --> 02:33.894
Is that okay?

02:33.894 --> 02:36.522
It's okay.
It's not so great for the kid.

02:36.522 --> 02:37.981
Why is it not great for the kid?

02:37.981 --> 02:42.028
I don't know any Zeckelman's
who hit 536 home runs.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.821
Yet.

02:43.821 --> 02:46.657
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, Larry.

02:46.657 --> 02:48.617
- Nice to meet you.
- I'll see you at temple.

02:48.617 --> 02:53.080
- Are you going with Zeckelman?
- I'm going with Zeckelman, yeah.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.540
Great. See you there.

02:54.540 --> 02:55.874
Okay.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.543
Let me tell you.
I met the greatest girl.

02:58.543 --> 03:01.005
Her name is Jenna,
and she's pretty incredible.

03:01.005 --> 03:03.841
Been going on for a couple weeks.
She's really funny.

03:03.841 --> 03:06.885
She's smart. She knows music.
She challenges me.

03:06.885 --> 03:08.970
- Great conversationalist.
- What does she do?

03:08.970 --> 03:11.639
She works for Disney.
I think she's an executive.

03:11.639 --> 03:13.309
She always is talking about the film.

03:13.309 --> 03:15.144
She knows all the things
that are coming out.

03:15.144 --> 03:17.729
I mean, she was talking about, like,
the princess costumes

03:17.729 --> 03:19.230
and where they're going and evolving.

03:19.230 --> 03:22.276
Just to be involved in steering
the television and the films is a lot,

03:22.276 --> 03:25.112
but she's got to keep it in her mind,
like, "How do I turn that into a ride?"

03:25.112 --> 03:28.615
That's pretty impressive, yeah.
I've never heard you talk like this.

03:28.615 --> 03:30.493
Well, I've never felt this way before.

03:30.493 --> 03:31.702
Sports. She into sports?

03:31.702 --> 03:33.579
It's too soon.
I haven't gotten into sports yet.

03:33.579 --> 03:36.582
If you get sports here,
it's too much.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.542
If I get sports,
you're my best man.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.586
If she working at Disney,
next time you talk to her,

03:40.586 --> 03:42.213
ask her about that fine-ass Tinkerbell.

03:42.213 --> 03:43.547
You're attracted to Tinkerbell?

03:43.547 --> 03:46.216
Tinkerbell flies her little ass.
She put her little booty out.

03:46.216 --> 03:49.928
With that little booty tooch.
That little booty go out, and bling!

03:49.928 --> 03:52.889
It speaks
of a very unusual perversion.

03:52.889 --> 03:55.850
A man attracted
to a thimble-sized fairy.

03:55.850 --> 03:59.522
Tinkerbell fine as fuck.
I'll put her in my motherfucking pocket.

03:59.522 --> 04:01.440
And I'll just walk
around knowing she home.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.608
And she flies her little ass out there,
give me a little kiss on the cheek

04:03.608 --> 04:04.735
and flies the fuck off.

04:07.530 --> 04:09.657
That's a nice-ass jacket you got, too.

04:09.657 --> 04:11.366
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Looks good on you.

04:11.366 --> 04:12.534
I really like it.

04:12.534 --> 04:14.704
And you wouldn't normally think
suede would be nice.

04:14.704 --> 04:16.372
'Cause it's a darker green.
Isn't it nice?

04:16.372 --> 04:18.749
Look at that fish.
What's up with that fish?

04:19.374 --> 04:22.003
- Looks like it's stuck.
- Look at him struggle.

04:22.003 --> 04:24.672
His little nose is trapped
in that filter.

04:25.505 --> 04:27.800
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.594
That fish, it looks like he's stuck.

04:30.594 --> 04:33.096
No, fish not stuck, fish sick.

04:33.096 --> 04:34.765
No, no, fish stuck.

04:34.765 --> 04:37.726
This time of year is tough for fish,
so fish gets sick easily.

04:37.726 --> 04:40.062
The filter is very warm,
so it make him feel better.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.312
So it's okay. It's normal.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.441
Seriously? Look at that.
That fish is stuck.

04:43.441 --> 04:45.817
See, fish wiggle,
it mean fish sneeze.

04:45.817 --> 04:47.569
Fish don't sneeze.
The fish didn't sneeze.

04:47.569 --> 04:49.529
- No, fish sneeze.
- This guy's stuck.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.198
- Fish sick now.
- Fish stuck.

04:51.198 --> 04:53.034
Well, he's gonna get sick
if he stays stuck.

04:54.118 --> 04:55.994
Can someone go in the tank
and unstuck?

04:55.994 --> 04:57.913
Sir, it's not necessary. Fish sick.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.831
- You're out of your mind.
- You know what?

04:59.831 --> 05:01.751
All this talk about fish,
now I want fish.

05:01.751 --> 05:04.754
- Give me the snapper off the menu.
- Fish delicious. Okay.

05:04.754 --> 05:06.756
- My man.
- No, that's a stuck fish.

05:06.756 --> 05:08.631
I feel so bad for that fish.

05:08.631 --> 05:10.633
At least that motherfucker can't drown.

05:13.679 --> 05:15.847
Great meeting everybody.
Keep coming back.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.183
It works if you work it.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.904
Hey, if it worked for you,
then that's all I care about.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.407
Hey.

05:33.407 --> 05:36.451
You're not supposed to have these.
These are for everybody.

05:36.451 --> 05:40.038
- They count it exactly.
- What? There's tons of 'em.

05:40.038 --> 05:42.041
Hey, Larry.
Thanks for coming.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.000
Hey, good to see ya.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.087
Tell ya what, you alcoholics, you know
your way around a good donut.

05:47.087 --> 05:49.881
- I guess that's true.
- Are you addicted to these now?

05:49.881 --> 05:51.508
Well, as you can tell.

05:52.342 --> 05:55.388
You know, Richard Lewis is here.
He spoke during the meeting.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.348
Well, he took over the meeting.
It was a lot.

05:58.348 --> 05:59.809
It was his turn to share.

05:59.809 --> 06:01.684
'Cause he shared and shared
and shared.

06:01.684 --> 06:04.438
A lot of people find it funny,
but he works so blue.

06:04.438 --> 06:08.900
I heard the word "hell"
like three times.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.655
- Listen...
- Just ask him.

06:12.655 --> 06:15.490
He gets this all the time, trust me.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.660
- I'm embarrassed.
- That's okay. Don't be embarrassed.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.077
Be embarrassed. Don't ask.

06:20.204 --> 06:21.955
If you don't have to, don't.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.874
My daughter, she wants to be a writer.

06:24.874 --> 06:28.963
I just wondered if you had anybody
that maybe could read her stuff?

06:32.966 --> 06:35.885
Sheesh. Let me think about it.

06:35.885 --> 06:38.430
- Really?
- What the hell are you doing, man?

06:38.430 --> 06:40.724
- He hates being hugged.
- There's no touching here.

06:43.393 --> 06:45.104
Really, I appreciate the compliment.

06:45.813 --> 06:48.189
- You should've seen me today.
- You had a good meeting?

06:48.189 --> 06:51.317
I got laughs bigger than I've ever
gotten before at a meeting.

06:51.317 --> 06:53.070
I thought you were supposed
to share here.

06:53.070 --> 06:54.488
It sounds like you're doing stand-up.

06:54.488 --> 06:56.364
- It's not stand-up.
- You're talking like it's stand-up.

06:56.364 --> 06:58.743
I can't divorce my comic self.

06:58.743 --> 07:02.038
Part of me will always be
a comedian and a drunk.

07:02.038 --> 07:04.247
I wish you would come
and see me sometime.

07:04.247 --> 07:05.790
Hey. Excuse me, Larry.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.252
You absolutely murdered it tonight.
Big laughs.

07:09.252 --> 07:12.465
Come back next time.
I'll do new stuff. They love me.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.801
What is going on here? This doesn't
sound like an AA meeting.

07:15.801 --> 07:18.220
- It sounds like a concert.
- I'm doing a service.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.306
But l want people to laugh and enjoy.

07:20.306 --> 07:21.932
Do you let anybody else talk?

07:21.932 --> 07:25.101
There was a sad old lady who opened
for me, but she only did 10 minutes.

07:25.101 --> 07:28.271
The only problem is you're doing
your act, but nobody's drinking.

07:28.271 --> 07:29.565
Imagine if they were drinking.

07:29.565 --> 07:32.360
If they were drinking,
the roof would be blown off.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.944
- You know, forget about it.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

07:34.944 --> 07:38.114
That was just incredible.
I had to thank you.

07:38.114 --> 07:39.824
- A lot of laughs?
- A lot of laughs.

07:39.824 --> 07:42.578
The bartender from hell part,
I was crying.

07:42.578 --> 07:44.245
- Did that work?
- Yeah, it totally worked.

07:44.245 --> 07:46.165
Have a good night.
Thank you.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.416
- I'm here, like, twice a week.
- Okay, good. Thanks.

07:48.416 --> 07:49.752
The bartender from hell.

07:49.752 --> 07:53.923
I do the "from hell" on occasion, but
I'm workshopping a few other things.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.801
I'll tell ya, another couple of meetings
like this, I'll have a special.

07:56.801 --> 07:59.387
That's a fantastic idea.
The AA special.

07:59.387 --> 08:00.971
This is the hook I've been looking for.

08:00.971 --> 08:04.892
Why not talk about being sober,
but get a special with HBO?

08:04.892 --> 08:06.102
There you go.

08:06.102 --> 08:07.769
Thank you.
That's why we're best friends.

08:07.769 --> 08:09.396
The Drunk From Hell concert.

08:14.068 --> 08:16.569
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- I don't think so.

08:16.569 --> 08:19.114
- What is this?
- You're gonna eat that?

08:19.114 --> 08:22.868
I may go get something else, so I need
to build a base with some rice.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.746
- Yeah, go build your rice base.
- You gonna be okay on your own?

08:25.746 --> 08:28.874
- It'll be tough, but yeah.
- Stay right there.

08:34.170 --> 08:37.090
- Hey!
- Good to see ya.

08:37.090 --> 08:39.384
Larry, this is Jenna,
who I told you so much about.

08:39.384 --> 08:41.762
- So nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:42.471 --> 08:45.390
- He talked. He did some talking.
- Did he?

08:45.390 --> 08:49.770
He did. I'm hearing talk.
A lot of talk.

08:49.770 --> 08:53.523
It's kind of fortuitous
that I ran into you, because...

08:53.983 --> 08:55.943
All right, here we go, okay?

08:55.943 --> 09:00.114
First of all, I hate asking for favors
almost as much as I hate doing favors.

09:00.114 --> 09:02.742
And so, I have a friend whose
daughter wrote a script,

09:02.742 --> 09:07.788
and the guy asked me if l knew
anybody who could read the script,

09:07.788 --> 09:11.541
and Freddy told me all about you,
and would you mind reading it?

09:11.541 --> 09:16.672
- You want me to read the script?
- I'm sure you're really busy.

09:16.672 --> 09:19.050
- l would love to read the script.
- You're kidding.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.301
No, I'd be excited.

09:20.301 --> 09:24.221
Maybe if you had any notes,
you know, feel free, you know.

09:24.221 --> 09:26.682
- Totally.
- I'm sure she would love that.

09:26.682 --> 09:29.768
- I can give her notes.
- Where did you find her?

09:29.768 --> 09:32.395
- Where's the planet?
- Did I oversell?

09:32.395 --> 09:35.691
- There's no more.
- Stop. I'm blushing.

09:35.691 --> 09:37.026
I'll get you guys set up.

09:37.026 --> 09:39.362
We got to run along
and meet a couple other people.

09:39.362 --> 09:41.822
- So nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:42.822 --> 09:44.408
- This is the guy?
- Yes, that's him.

09:44.408 --> 09:47.536
- Right here?
- But we don't have to make a thing.

09:47.536 --> 09:50.497
Just give me a second.
Hey. Larry?

09:50.497 --> 09:54.627
Abe Zeckelman. You have a problem
with the name of our child?

09:56.252 --> 09:58.673
- I wouldn't say it's a problem.
- Well, what is it?

09:58.673 --> 10:02.134
I thought that given the choice
of Mantle and Zeckelman

10:02.134 --> 10:04.552
that Mantle was a better name.

10:04.552 --> 10:05.805
Based on what exactly?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.430
Let's be honest,
it's not a great name.

10:07.430 --> 10:09.475
- What's wrong with it?
- Zeckelman? Come on.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.435
You seem really worked up
over my last name.

10:11.435 --> 10:14.104
If you think that's a great name,
then what's a bad name?

10:14.104 --> 10:16.314
I'd rather have a bad last name
than no last name.

10:16.314 --> 10:19.110
My name's Larry. I don't think it's
a great name. I'm honest about it.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.903
Would I rather be a Dash, or a Dazzy,
or a Dan?

10:21.903 --> 10:24.740
Well, the good thing about an opinion
is that you can keep it to yourself.

10:24.740 --> 10:27.201
But then everybody would walk
around not saying anything.

10:27.201 --> 10:29.619
- You're not keeping this to yourself.
- No, I couldn't keep this to myself.

10:29.619 --> 10:31.330
I couldn't keep that to myself.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.665
It's a deeply inappropriate
conversation to be having.

10:33.665 --> 10:36.668
Just think about the playground.
He's in a unique situation.

10:37.128 --> 10:38.629
What's that supposed to mean?

10:38.629 --> 10:41.089
Well, you know, the two dads.

10:41.089 --> 10:43.384
Yeah, it's not that unique
of a situation.

10:43.384 --> 10:46.052
- Maybe it's not unique. Different.
- Different?

10:46.803 --> 10:49.724
- Slightly different?
- To us, it's normal.

10:49.724 --> 10:51.474
Yeah...

10:51.474 --> 10:54.644
Let me ask you this question. How did
you decide on the last name anyway?

10:54.644 --> 10:56.772
I assume it's your semen, right?

10:57.605 --> 10:59.983
- What did you just say?
- We're talking about semen now.

10:59.983 --> 11:02.653
I assume it's your semen?
That's how you got Zeckelman?

11:02.653 --> 11:05.864
- We're having this conversation?
- I'm just wondering how you got there.

11:05.864 --> 11:09.452
- It's my semen.
- If you must know, it's his semen.

11:09.452 --> 11:11.537
- It's your semen?
- What's the problem with that?

11:11.537 --> 11:16.709
I mean, you would think
that the donor would get the name.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.211
Well, we had a conversation
at home about it.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.462
Because it's a private thing.

11:20.462 --> 11:24.258
I don't know if you've chosen a first
name, but if you need any help,

11:24.632 --> 11:25.675
I'm your guy.

11:25.675 --> 11:29.638
- 'Cause you got two first names.
- Off the top of my head, Ziggy.

11:29.638 --> 11:32.391
- Ziggy Zeckelman.
- You think that's a great name?

11:32.391 --> 11:34.060
I do. Scooter Zeckelman?

11:34.060 --> 11:36.227
They're all good names.
We'll put 'em both in the hat.

11:36.227 --> 11:39.064
- We're not putting that in the hat.
- How 'bout Foots?

11:39.064 --> 11:41.441
Is our family a joke to you, Larry?

11:41.441 --> 11:43.902
No! Zeckelman needs
a cool first name!

11:43.902 --> 11:46.780
I think I've had enough
of this conversation.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.823
- Great to meet you, Larry.
- Doc Zeckelman.

11:48.823 --> 11:51.034
- Doc Zeckelman is a joke.
- Ace.

11:51.034 --> 11:52.869
- I'm gonna go get some food.
- Ace Zeckelman?

11:52.869 --> 11:55.372
- That's not a great name?
- We're gonna talk about it at home.

11:55.372 --> 11:59.752
Dewey, Duncan, Deegan. Deegan.
After the Major Deegan Expressway.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.128
- We got plenty of options.
- I'm giving you gold here.

12:02.128 --> 12:05.716
Chris. Forget it.

12:05.716 --> 12:07.134
- What?
- Don't bother.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.136
I got to go.

12:09.719 --> 12:12.055
Babe, come on. Come back.

12:28.656 --> 12:30.031
What the fuck?

12:33.785 --> 12:36.998
Excuse me. Rabbi Adelman?
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:36.998 --> 12:39.250
- Sorry to interrupt.
- I'm glad you're here today.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.168
- Who's in charge of the bricks?
- I am.

12:41.168 --> 12:43.671
You are? You know there's a brick
that says,

12:43.671 --> 12:46.757
"L. David is disrespectful to women"?
You allowed that to be up there?

12:46.757 --> 12:48.467
We don't really edit the bricks.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.928
The donor gets to express what
thoughts and feelings they have.

12:51.928 --> 12:53.973
So anybody can write anything
they want on a brick?

12:53.973 --> 12:57.309
- Well, we would not like hate speech.
- That's hate speech.

12:57.309 --> 13:00.770
- I think it's strong dislike speech.
- I want that taken down.

13:00.770 --> 13:03.022
We only add bricks.
We don't take them away.

13:03.022 --> 13:07.403
You don't remove bricks? That brick
is gonna be up there forever.

13:07.986 --> 13:09.071
Posterity.

13:09.071 --> 13:13.033
There's nothing in the Old Testament
about defamatory bricks?

13:13.033 --> 13:15.785
You think if Isaac chiseled something
defamatory about Jedediah,

13:15.785 --> 13:17.370
you think it wouldn't be taken down?

13:17.370 --> 13:19.999
There's nothing in the Torah
about defamatory bricks.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.294
You know what this is, Rabbi?
This is a shanda.

13:23.294 --> 13:25.712
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

13:27.715 --> 13:28.923
Larry?

13:29.508 --> 13:32.594
Oh my God! This is crazy.

13:33.054 --> 13:35.972
Hi, again. What a treat.

13:35.972 --> 13:38.642
Usually most people you don't
really want to run into either,

13:38.642 --> 13:40.770
but l'm not minding this at all.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.189
- Me neither. Likewise.
- So what are you doing here?

13:43.189 --> 13:46.941
I'm actually in the process
of converting to Judaism.

13:46.941 --> 13:50.987
- Yeah, that's my rabbi.
- Get the hell out of here. What?

13:50.987 --> 13:53.240
- You're joining the team?
- I am.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.328
We are so happy to have you.
Are you prepared to complain a lot?

13:57.328 --> 13:59.954
Please, I can kvetch
with the best of them. Come on.

14:00.665 --> 14:05.210
Very impressive.
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask, why?

14:05.210 --> 14:08.798
I like the whole thing. I like the food
and the community,

14:09.464 --> 14:11.800
and truth be told, you know,
I like the men.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.011
Aside from the obvious,
you know, reasons.

14:14.011 --> 14:18.015
These obvious reasons escape me.
What are they?

14:18.015 --> 14:22.603
I mean, you know, their...
Can't deal with the alternative.

14:25.815 --> 14:28.483
- Yeah. It's so good to see you.
- Very good to see you, too.

14:28.483 --> 14:31.111
I have one question for you.
What is this wall?

14:31.111 --> 14:36.158
This is for tennis. They put the winners
of the tournament up.

14:36.158 --> 14:39.994
You guys do a temple tennis
tournament? I am obsessed with tennis.

14:39.994 --> 14:42.205
I know, but it's just a wall.

14:42.205 --> 14:45.001
You should enter the tournament
next year.

14:45.001 --> 14:48.336
They have a temple tournament?
Mixed doubles?

14:48.336 --> 14:49.754
Mixed doubles, yeah.

14:49.754 --> 14:53.884
Amazing. How's everything?
How's the whole court case?

14:53.884 --> 14:55.845
It's scary, yeah.
It's a frightening prospect.

14:55.845 --> 15:00.598
I could plead guilty and just get off,
but I'm not gonna do that.

15:01.474 --> 15:04.270
- And I don't think it's a big deal.
- That's so sweet.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.148
Listen, I'm having a dinner party
next week.

15:08.148 --> 15:11.819
I don't know if you're around,
but I'd love you to come.

15:13.069 --> 15:15.990
Really. There are so many people that
would love to meet you and talk to you,

15:15.990 --> 15:17.907
and I would love to see you again.

15:17.907 --> 15:21.203
So, maybe?
Next week sometime?

15:21.746 --> 15:25.874
If you're here. It would be an honor
for all of us. What do you say?

15:27.917 --> 15:31.588
I don't think I can make it.

15:32.715 --> 15:37.636
Okay. Well, let's just hope we can
run into each other again.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.264
- Yeah, hope so.
- Yeah. I got to schmeitz.

15:40.264 --> 15:42.767
You what? What's that one?

15:42.767 --> 15:46.103
Got to go. It's Yiddish.

15:46.103 --> 15:48.521
- That's a new one to me.
- There you go.

15:53.402 --> 15:56.655
I'm running a little late,
so you can just drop me off here.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.115
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I work right there.

15:59.115 --> 16:01.911
I don't mind taking you
a little further if it's...

16:01.911 --> 16:04.789
No, this is great. I work right there.

16:04.789 --> 16:08.458
Do you work above the Disney store?
They have an office or something?

16:08.458 --> 16:10.920
No, I work at the Disney store.

16:11.461 --> 16:14.131
So you're managing
the different stores or...

16:14.131 --> 16:16.716
Oh, God no.
I don't have the head for numbers.

16:16.716 --> 16:19.595
I'm so sorry.
What do you do here?

16:19.595 --> 16:22.098
I'm a greeter,
and I talk to the guests.

16:22.098 --> 16:25.308
I put on a costume,
like a princess,

16:25.308 --> 16:28.561
like Snow White or Elsa
or Ariel.

16:28.561 --> 16:32.650
My favorite is Mickey's favorite,

16:33.442 --> 16:37.028
Minnie Mouse.
It's the best.

16:37.028 --> 16:39.198
- And you do all of that...
- Right there.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.866
At the Disney store?

16:40.866 --> 16:43.660
You know what would be so helpful
with that is the "store" part.

16:43.660 --> 16:47.455
"Hello. Come in. The most
magical store in the mall."

16:47.455 --> 16:51.626
You don't have any managerial or
developmental role at Disney at all?

16:51.626 --> 16:53.754
No. I mean,
I'm a senior character.

16:53.754 --> 16:58.217
- What's a junior character?
- I would say, like, Doc McStuffins.

16:59.135 --> 17:01.636
But listen, I got to go.
I had so much fun last night.

17:02.096 --> 17:04.724
- It was a great evening.
- I'll see you later. Bye.

17:05.598 --> 17:09.562
Oh boy! Bye.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.856
All right. Save it for in there.
Don't drain the tank with me.

17:20.614 --> 17:22.700
- How did you not know that?
- How would I know?

17:22.700 --> 17:25.660
We're talking about movies and music,
and she tells me she works for Disney.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.955
You never asked her about her job?
What about Disney?

17:27.955 --> 17:29.164
What department?

17:29.164 --> 17:33.377
She lives in Glendale. I just assumed
she's like animation or something.

17:33.377 --> 17:35.420
I didn't know she was working
at the fucking Americana.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.590
I feel like I've been living a lie,
I got to be honest.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.633
I had this whole great thing in my head
that I was excited about,

17:40.633 --> 17:42.136
and now I just feel crushed.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.221
Well, you had somebody
who's accomplished.

17:44.221 --> 17:47.057
She had a status,
and the status is gone.

17:47.057 --> 17:48.641
So what is that saying about you?

17:48.641 --> 17:51.519
You're right.
It does say something about me.

17:51.519 --> 17:55.148
The problem is this makes you
reflect on who you are,

17:55.148 --> 17:57.192
because she's the same person.

17:57.192 --> 17:59.653
It's the same great stories.
It's the same sense of humor.

17:59.653 --> 18:02.113
It's the same likes and dislikes,
but it feels so different.

18:02.113 --> 18:04.824
I think there's a lesson
to be learned here.

18:04.824 --> 18:07.702
Questions. Women like questions.

18:07.702 --> 18:11.165
When you have a date with someone,
you've got to ask a ton of questions.

18:11.165 --> 18:12.874
Otherwise, they're going back
to their friends,

18:12.874 --> 18:15.210
and you know what they're saying?
"He didn't ask me one question."

18:15.210 --> 18:17.837
- They love questions.
- What would you do? Honestly.

18:17.837 --> 18:20.215
I'm so superficial,
I'd probably break up.

18:20.215 --> 18:21.424
Right away?

18:21.424 --> 18:23.636
Yeah. I'm not gonna date
Minnie Mouse.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.096
I think the thing I got to do
is at least kind of try.

18:26.096 --> 18:28.223
You know, spend some time
with her and bridge the gap.

18:28.223 --> 18:30.308
- Oh my God.
- What is it?

18:31.769 --> 18:34.437
I gave her a script to read.
She said she'd be happy to!

18:34.437 --> 18:36.732
Why didn't you ask her what kind
of development she did?

18:36.732 --> 18:38.983
- Why is she taking a script?
- Are you gonna listen to the notes?

18:38.983 --> 18:41.319
I'm gonna listen to the notes
from Minnie Mouse!

18:41.319 --> 18:47.910
The callback to the Corona ad on the
beach? So, so good. I loved that part.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.370
Thank you.

18:50.370 --> 18:55.041
Honestly, Dana, it's really refreshing
to see a comedic, apocalyptic show.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.878
- So you're buying the whole premise?
- Totally.

18:57.878 --> 18:59.588
'Cause it's out there.

18:59.588 --> 19:03.216
And when it comes to questions,
one last thing. Meg.

19:03.216 --> 19:05.802
- I didn't understand.
- You didn't understand?

19:05.802 --> 19:09.306
Like, what she wanted?
Yeah. I struggled with that.

19:09.306 --> 19:11.934
She's a little one dimensional.
I had more in there.

19:11.934 --> 19:14.644
Like, her backstory, what she went
to school for, all that stuff.

19:14.644 --> 19:18.815
I think you should put it back.
Does it feel long?

19:20.150 --> 19:22.694
Yes. And I almost trimmed it.

19:22.694 --> 19:26.198
I'm so embarrassed.
I just need to tighten it up.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.950
Dana, I think you have
such a good script here.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.828
- Thank you so much.
- You're getting me so, so excited.

19:31.828 --> 19:34.748
And I just want to thank you
for letting me read it.

19:34.748 --> 19:37.209
Are you kidding me? Thank you
for reading it.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.337
And if there's anything else
you want me to read...

19:39.337 --> 19:40.920
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.800
I'm so excited for you and your future.
And oh my God, oh my God.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.719
We're coming out with a new line
of Little Mermaid sleepwear,

19:47.719 --> 19:49.972
and I get a discount,
so if you text me your sizes,

19:49.972 --> 19:51.431
I can hook you up.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.852
Hey, you want some of this?

19:54.852 --> 19:56.437
- You wash your hands?
- No.

19:56.437 --> 19:57.813
'Cause you're making it for yourself,

19:57.813 --> 19:59.899
so you're doing all this stuff
like a third base coach. No.

19:59.899 --> 20:04.110
- What you guys talking about?
- Look at this. I come bearing gifts.

20:04.110 --> 20:06.529
- Shit, man. Don't do this.
- What do we think it is?

20:06.529 --> 20:08.281
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

20:08.949 --> 20:11.242
You said you liked it,
and so I'm giving it to you.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.328
- I did say that.
- Come on, do us the honors.

20:13.328 --> 20:14.955
I'ma put this shit on, man.

20:15.663 --> 20:17.375
- Looking sharp.
- Holy cow.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.708
I think it looks incredible.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.877
Anybody want to get Chinese food
for lunch today?

20:20.877 --> 20:22.004
Nah. Fuck that.

20:22.004 --> 20:23.839
I can't 'cause I got to see
Minnie Mouse.

20:23.839 --> 20:26.676
I'm gonna have a better attitude about
it. She's the same person, right?

20:26.676 --> 20:29.719
I got a date, and I'm gonna keep it,
and I'm gonna make it work.

20:29.719 --> 20:31.889
- Thank you for everything.
- Appreciate it too, man.

20:31.889 --> 20:35.101
- I appreciate you.
- Appreciate you, Secret Santa.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.603
Jesus, that's amazing he gave
you that jacket. That was so nice.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.938
It's the "I like it" gambit.

20:39.938 --> 20:42.440
All you got to do is compliment people
on what the fuck they're wearing,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.025
and they gonna give you one.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.278
You know what?
It's not a bad idea.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.654
It's a fucking great idea.

20:47.654 --> 20:50.073
I'll bet that works
like 50% of the time.

20:50.073 --> 20:53.244
Wish I had a suede durag to go
with this motherfucker.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.042
Fuck you, Larry.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.962
Fuck you, Larry!

21:04.505 --> 21:05.714
So what's going on?

21:05.714 --> 21:09.218
You know, not that much.
What is this material?

21:09.218 --> 21:11.012
- What do you call this material?
- Cotton.

21:11.345 --> 21:13.555
- You think this is cotton?
- Why are you here?

21:14.223 --> 21:16.475
Well, it's very simple, really.

21:16.850 --> 21:19.311
So they renovated the temple,
and they have this plaza,

21:19.311 --> 21:21.230
and they were selling these bricks
for charity.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.900
And Hobie Turner wrote something
very defamatory about me,

21:24.900 --> 21:26.317
and it's there for everyone to see.

21:26.317 --> 21:28.487
It says, "Larry David
is disrespectful to women."

21:28.487 --> 21:30.739
Come on, Cheryl.
I love women.

21:30.739 --> 21:33.659
Who loves women more than me?
I love having sex with them.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.287
I love talking to them.
I'm a champion of women.

21:36.287 --> 21:39.498
Being a champion to women
is saying that you love...

21:39.498 --> 21:41.292
Well, it means I'm attracted to women.
I like them.

21:41.292 --> 21:42.751
There's a difference.

21:42.751 --> 21:45.045
So I'd like to refute his brick

21:45.045 --> 21:48.715
by having somebody who I know
write something nice about me.

21:48.715 --> 21:49.842
- On the brick?
- Yes.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.635
"I was married to Larry David
for many years,"

21:52.635 --> 21:55.806
"and he's a veritable champion
of women." Something like that.

21:55.806 --> 21:58.434
Right next to it. They'll read his
first. They'll read yours second.

21:58.434 --> 21:59.893
You buy a brick.

22:01.645 --> 22:03.563
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

22:03.563 --> 22:06.900
- It doesn't feel right.
- What's not right?

22:06.900 --> 22:10.111
- Because it sounds bullshitty.
- You don't have to say that exactly.

22:10.111 --> 22:14.532
Say something nice. You think you
could come up with something nice?

22:14.532 --> 22:17.369
- Hey, Cheryl?
- Hi.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.373
Hi, Larry.
Can we run lines when he goes?

22:20.373 --> 22:25.378
Well, Larry has a defamatory brick,
and he wants me to buy more bricks.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.963
Yeah, somebody wrote a defamatory
brick about me.

22:27.963 --> 22:30.049
It says, "Larry David
is disrespectful to women."

22:30.049 --> 22:32.927
Terrible, terrible thing to say.
And I love women, Ted.

22:32.927 --> 22:34.886
Well, he loves having sex with women,

22:34.886 --> 22:38.807
and he thinks that that proves
that he respects women.

22:38.807 --> 22:40.476
And there are other things, too.

22:40.476 --> 22:46.022
Larry, completely understand. The deal
is we already bought a brick, right?

22:46.022 --> 22:47.899
Yeah, we already bought a brick.

22:47.899 --> 22:51.070
You didn't even know what I was talking
about when I brought up the brick.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.739
You probably told me, and I forgot
or something. I don't know.

22:53.739 --> 22:58.661
Maybe I forgot to tell you. I'm sorry.
But we did. We bought a brick.

22:58.661 --> 23:00.662
Ted does a lot of things.
He's very charitable.

23:00.662 --> 23:04.082
You bought a brick, huh?
And what does your brick say, Ted?

23:04.082 --> 23:05.751
Nothing. We left it blank.

23:06.502 --> 23:09.088
- The brick says nothing?
- Yeah. You know, we're raising money.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.673
We're not trying to advertise.

23:10.673 --> 23:13.174
I don't think you bought a brick.
What do you think about that?

23:13.174 --> 23:15.552
Look, the point is we bought
a fucking brick, Larry.

23:15.552 --> 23:17.972
I'll tell you what.
I'll make it very easy for you.

23:17.972 --> 23:20.391
I'll buy the brick.
I'll write something nice.

23:20.391 --> 23:22.351
All you got to do
is put your name on it.

23:22.351 --> 23:23.519
I don't feel comfortable.

23:23.519 --> 23:26.980
What if it just said, "I was married to
Larry David, and he's a decent guy"?

23:26.980 --> 23:29.858
- Who writes that on a brick?
- It's dishonest.

23:29.858 --> 23:31.151
Well, then you write it.

23:31.151 --> 23:32.820
I don't have anything to say on a brick.

23:33.571 --> 23:35.906
You can't think of one nice thing
to say about me on a brick?

23:35.906 --> 23:37.115
No, not on a brick.

23:37.115 --> 23:38.658
All right, so just for argument's sake,

23:38.658 --> 23:41.954
is there anything nice you could say
about me that's not on a brick?

23:41.954 --> 23:43.455
Yes.

23:44.540 --> 23:49.085
Something on a cake.
"Congratulations, good job".

23:49.085 --> 23:52.340
- "Happy birthday."
- "He's a good golfer sometimes."

23:52.340 --> 23:55.675
- You want some more tea?
- I'd love some more tea.

23:55.675 --> 23:58.429
How much longer do you think
you'll be staying, Larry?

23:59.054 --> 24:00.681
I'm leaving right now.

24:00.681 --> 24:03.351
I just need to learn these lines,
that's all.

24:03.351 --> 24:07.313
Nice pen. Good pen. Look at that pen.
That's some pen.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.273
- Thank you.
- How do you get a pen like that?

24:10.273 --> 24:12.777
- Do you want the pen, Larry?
- I'm not gonna take your pen.

24:12.777 --> 24:14.236
- Take the pen.
- Really?

24:14.236 --> 24:16.488
- Yes, take the pen.
- You're giving me your pen?

24:16.488 --> 24:18.031
Good luck with the brick.

24:19.908 --> 24:21.369
Okay. How's this?

24:21.369 --> 24:25.830
"He's an amiable fellow
and a big supporter of Title Nine."

24:25.830 --> 24:27.041
Bullshit.

24:27.541 --> 24:33.381
"He's an amiable fellow
who's attended two WNBA games."

24:33.381 --> 24:34.714
- Is that true?
- No.

24:34.714 --> 24:37.342
And besides, you never went
to one of Sammy's softball games.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.095
I invited you so many times.

24:39.095 --> 24:41.180
The kid couldn't even lift up a pencil.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.265
Stop it. She's very talented!

24:43.265 --> 24:44.725
How 'bout this?

24:44.725 --> 24:47.186
"Any woman who Larry David
impregnated"

24:47.186 --> 24:49.438
"he not only paid for the abortion,"

24:49.438 --> 24:53.359
"but accompanied her
to the procedure". That's true.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.736
- You're wasting my time. Leave.
- You're not gonna buy a brick?

24:55.736 --> 24:56.945
Apparently not.

25:22.137 --> 25:23.639
- Hello?
- Hey, Larry.

25:23.639 --> 25:26.434
- It's Cyrus, Irma's sponsor.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

25:26.434 --> 25:28.768
I just wanted to call you because
my daughter met

25:28.768 --> 25:31.230
with that woman you recommended,
Jenna.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.481
Yeah, look...

25:33.566 --> 25:36.444
- She was great.
- What?

25:36.444 --> 25:39.904
My daughter said she gave great notes.
She made the script better.

25:39.904 --> 25:41.239
- She was amazing.
- Seriously?

25:41.239 --> 25:43.616
Yeah! I thought she wouldn't
even give her the time of day.

25:43.616 --> 25:46.494
Yeah, for a high-powered executive,
she's very down to Earth, isn't she?

25:46.494 --> 25:49.247
Yeah. Right?
They even met at a coffee shop.

25:49.247 --> 25:51.166
You'd think she's just a regular person.

25:51.166 --> 25:54.670
Anyway, Dana wanted to send her
some flowers to her office at Disney.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.629
So if you could shoot me her address.

25:56.629 --> 25:59.050
I don't think you need to do that.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.926
Well, I live by the Americana
in Glendale.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.554
I could just go over and get a gift card
and send it over.

26:03.554 --> 26:05.014
- How about that?
- No, not necessary.

26:05.014 --> 26:08.058
I'll just pass on your enthusiasm.

26:08.058 --> 26:11.604
Larry!
Larry, where are my sleep brassieres?

26:12.063 --> 26:13.855
How the fuck do I know?

26:15.106 --> 26:16.609
I owe you one. I really do.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.485
If there's anything I can do for you...

26:18.485 --> 26:20.780
- Larry!
- What?

26:22.155 --> 26:24.825
Never mind. They were in the hamper.
They're not that dirty.

26:24.825 --> 26:27.369
If you need anything from me,
you just say the word, okay?

26:27.995 --> 26:31.331
You know, now that you mention it,
there actually is something you can do.

26:31.331 --> 26:32.458
Yeah, say the word.

26:33.709 --> 26:39.173
According to your timeline, I have
eight weeks left with Irma.

26:39.173 --> 26:45.262
I'm wondering if there's any possible
way that we can move that up.

26:45.721 --> 26:49.516
Wait. You're saying you want
to break up with her early?

26:49.516 --> 26:51.435
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.644
Is there any reason?

26:52.644 --> 26:55.398
Yeah, I hate her.
That's the reason. How's that?

26:55.398 --> 26:57.023
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

26:57.023 --> 27:00.903
I'm: struggling here, Cyrus,
and Sienna Miller is interested in me.

27:02.405 --> 27:03.990
- I'm not joking.
- Really?

27:04.406 --> 27:06.117
When is this gonna happen again?
Never.

27:06.117 --> 27:10.705
So come on. Help a brother out.
Is there anything we can do?

27:10.705 --> 27:12.455
Larry, I appreciate everything
you've done for us,

27:12.455 --> 27:15.542
but a breakup would just set her back,
and I can't allow that to happen.

27:15.542 --> 27:18.004
Is that better than murder?
Who benefits from murder?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.422
She's dead, and I'm in prison.

27:19.422 --> 27:21.798
Larry, I think you're saying a lot
of things you don't mean right now.

27:21.798 --> 27:24.051
No, no, I mean it. Come on.
There's got to be a way.

27:24.051 --> 27:28.054
If she were to break up with you,
I guess that would be okay.

27:28.054 --> 27:29.265
Her idea?

27:29.265 --> 27:32.601
Then that would give her the power,
give her her own agency.

27:32.601 --> 27:35.437
like it's gonna be her idea. On what
planet? That's never gonna happen.

27:35.437 --> 27:37.648
I'm sorry. But thank you.

27:38.399 --> 27:41.109
Larry, where are my bunion splints?

27:41.109 --> 27:43.987
Today was amazing, though.
'Cause you know Penny?

27:43.987 --> 27:45.864
She's normally a chipmunk,
Chip or Dale,

27:45.864 --> 27:48.326
and she's in, like,
what we call fur all the time.

27:48.326 --> 27:51.327
She got to be Tinkerbell this week,
and it was unbelievable,

27:51.327 --> 27:54.164
and we were so happy for her.
And she was so good with the kids.

27:54.164 --> 27:56.417
And she was just having
the best time ever,

27:56.417 --> 27:58.419
because she's never a face character.

27:58.419 --> 28:02.797
She's a little tall to be a pixie,
but she was incredible.

28:02.797 --> 28:05.383
And we had a Peter Pan.
Ian was being Peter Pan that day.

28:08.011 --> 28:09.554
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thank you.

28:09.554 --> 28:12.016
I'd like a table for two
by the aquarium.

28:12.016 --> 28:13.559
That table is reserved.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.978
But we have nice table
over here by window.

28:15.978 --> 28:17.687
- It's reserved?
- Yes.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.397
Okay, we'll go over there.

28:19.397 --> 28:22.651
- You follow me, sir. This way.
- All right. Okay.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.829
Sir, can I help you? Excuse me, sir.

28:35.206 --> 28:36.873
Your table that way.

28:36.873 --> 28:40.169
Yeah, what happened to the orange
fish that was stuck?

28:40.169 --> 28:42.755
Fish sad,
so we changed new location.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.756
Change of scenery
make much happy fish.

28:44.756 --> 28:46.549
- So, you moved the fish?
- Yes.

28:46.549 --> 28:49.219
Fish living best life in downtown.
Very happy there.

28:49.219 --> 28:50.596
That was so nice of you.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.847
You can go visit your new friend,
orange fish.

28:52.847 --> 28:55.141
I can handle the death of the fish.
Just tell me.

28:55.141 --> 28:57.603
Fish fine. Fish thriving.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.022
No, no, fish stuck. Fish dead.

29:00.022 --> 29:02.566
No. Fish sick. Fish gone.

29:02.566 --> 29:06.779
- Stuck. Dead.
- Sick, gone!

29:07.863 --> 29:12.409
- Fish not your problem anymore.
- I will not forget fish.

29:15.286 --> 29:17.164
Okay, I bring your table some water.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.042
- How's your fish?
- Fish dead.

29:21.043 --> 29:24.547
Listen to me. You should've heard
Irma today at the AA meeting.

29:24.547 --> 29:27.133
You would've been blown away.
She shared for a half hour.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.593
- Well, what did she say?
- First of all, I would never tell you.

29:30.593 --> 29:32.805
In AA, there's principles,
there's guidelines.

29:32.805 --> 29:36.641
So any wino in Santa Monica can hear
what she's saying, but I can't?

29:36.641 --> 29:39.854
- AA is private, man. That's it.
- I'm not gonna tell anybody.

29:39.854 --> 29:42.273
- I just won't do it.
- But we're good friends.

29:42.273 --> 29:44.066
- I'm not telling you.
- So you're not gonna tell me?

29:44.066 --> 29:47.445
- No.
- Suppose I put you in my will?

29:47.445 --> 29:50.072
Her first husband, horrible accident,

29:50.072 --> 29:52.741
and she was with him 24/7,
like a caregiver.

29:52.741 --> 29:54.952
- Was he in a wheelchair?
- Worse.

29:54.952 --> 29:57.079
- Diapers?
- He had diapers everywhere.

29:57.746 --> 30:00.750
He was like the fucking mummy.
He lost some of his toes.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.377
His spine was sticking out.

30:03.377 --> 30:05.253
He couldn't move. He couldn't walk.

30:05.253 --> 30:07.256
And she started
to drink more and more,

30:07.256 --> 30:09.215
and then she became
an alcoholic over this.

30:09.215 --> 30:10.676
And then one day she woke up,
she went,

30:10.676 --> 30:12.802
"You know, this is not the way
I envisioned my life."

30:12.802 --> 30:14.387
So, she just left the guy high
and dry.

30:14.387 --> 30:17.475
- She didn't want to take care of him?
- She wanted to think about her life.

30:17.475 --> 30:19.893
Selfish. That's her husband.

30:19.893 --> 30:22.270
- She never wanted to see him again.
- It was the diapers.

30:22.270 --> 30:25.857
She said she wasn't proud of it,
but if the situation happened again,

30:26.525 --> 30:28.693
she would do the same thing.
She would still split.

30:29.111 --> 30:32.655
She knows what she wants in life.
Let me ask you something.

30:33.740 --> 30:35.825
How much were you thinking
about leaving me?

30:36.410 --> 30:39.246
- No, nothing. Yeah.
- What?

30:39.246 --> 30:42.040
It was a trick to get you to talk
about it. Which you did.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.709
In three minutes,
I lost all that money?

30:43.709 --> 30:47.504
That's all it took to get it out
of you, your solemn AA oath?

30:47.504 --> 30:49.589
- They should kick you out of there.
- I have weaknesses.

30:49.589 --> 30:51.884
- I got a good mind to squeal on you.
- Let's eat.

31:04.979 --> 31:06.190
Hey, Larry.

31:06.606 --> 31:10.027
Oh my God.
What's going on here?

31:10.027 --> 31:14.281
I was working late last night.
I got kicked out of my house.

31:15.198 --> 31:18.034
- You got kicked out of your house?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

31:18.661 --> 31:21.413
- Did we have a meeting or something?
- Why'd you get kicked out?

31:21.413 --> 31:25.875
Quite frankly, you stuck this thing
in my head about naming babies,

31:25.875 --> 31:28.128
and we got in a big fight,
and things were thrown,

31:28.128 --> 31:29.963
and you got in the middle of everything,

31:29.963 --> 31:32.550
and now we don't know what
we're gonna name the baby.

31:32.550 --> 31:34.926
- So it's my fault.
- You planted this thing in our head.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.261
And then you brought up semen.

31:36.261 --> 31:39.557
That's none of your business about
what I do with my own semen.

31:39.557 --> 31:41.474
Are you telling me
that if it's your semen,

31:41.474 --> 31:43.560
you shouldn't have the right
to name the baby?

31:43.560 --> 31:46.063
But it's my business. I don't tell you
what to do with your semen.

31:46.063 --> 31:47.565
What am I gonna do with semen?

31:47.565 --> 31:49.524
A normal man knows
what to do with semen.

31:49.524 --> 31:53.236
I do normal things with semen. I wipe
it up and throw it away. What else?

31:53.236 --> 31:56.030
Well, you could impregnate
somebody else and have a baby.

31:56.030 --> 31:59.409
Okay. If I did do that and my partner's
name was Papalopadopalous,

31:59.409 --> 32:01.077
I would use David as the last name.

32:01.077 --> 32:02.912
That would be your prerogative.

32:02.912 --> 32:06.834
And I wouldn't come to you and say
you should name it this or that.

32:06.834 --> 32:09.754
Yes, but you knew deep down
that I was right.

32:09.754 --> 32:12.173
And that's why you brought it up.
That's why you had a fight.

32:12.173 --> 32:14.258
That's why you got kicked out.
Isn't that so?

32:14.841 --> 32:18.762
Larry, you're out of order. Let me name
my own baby with my husband.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.013
End of story.

32:20.013 --> 32:22.348
I'm kind of surprised
you're sloughing off the blame on me.

32:22.348 --> 32:24.768
And I'm equally surprised
you won't accept the blame.

32:24.768 --> 32:28.688
I think I'm way more surprised than you
about the sloughing of the blame.

32:28.688 --> 32:32.485
And I'm really wildly surprised
that you aren't accepting.

32:32.485 --> 32:37.030
I am so incredulous that you think
I am more to blame than you.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.657
- What are you doing here, Larr?
- Can I sue a temple?

32:40.242 --> 32:41.285
For what?

32:41.285 --> 32:43.578
There's a defamatory brick
at that temple.

32:43.578 --> 32:45.164
- Yeah, I saw that.
- You saw that?

32:45.539 --> 32:47.083
What was your reaction
when you saw that?

32:47.083 --> 32:49.000
They can do anything they want.
It's freedom of religion.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.335
Freedom of religion?

32:50.335 --> 32:51.962
You just go around calling people
assholes,

32:51.962 --> 32:54.131
and you put it on a temple,
that's not slander?

32:54.131 --> 32:56.175
Anything else I can help you with?

32:57.592 --> 32:59.719
How'd the filing go? Are we good?

33:03.140 --> 33:05.892
Oh God!
Oh my God!

33:05.892 --> 33:10.022
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait!
- Don't even say it.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.482
- I forgot to file it.
- You forgot to file it?

33:12.482 --> 33:14.317
How could you forget to file it?

33:14.317 --> 33:16.696
I forgot to file it because of the shit
you put me through, Larry!

33:16.696 --> 33:19.197
- It's my fault you forgot to file?
- Yes!

33:19.197 --> 33:21.366
And if you accepted it,
then this wouldn't have happened.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.035
Why did you get involved in my stuff?

33:23.035 --> 33:25.162
- Well, can you file it now?
- No, I can't file it now.

33:25.162 --> 33:27.164
- It's past the deadline.
- It's past the deadline?

33:27.164 --> 33:29.792
It's past the deadline. I missed it.

33:31.251 --> 33:32.794
Look, it's going to trial.

33:32.794 --> 33:35.880
- I can go to jail for a year!
- We're gonna win the trial.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.135
I'm confident we're going to win.
Don't worry about a thing, okay?

33:39.135 --> 33:40.803
I'm gonna make this priority.

33:41.428 --> 33:44.098
I know you don't want to hear it,
but I have to say it anyway.

33:44.098 --> 33:45.224
What is it?

33:45.224 --> 33:47.142
I think a great compromise

33:48.685 --> 33:50.520
is Ziggy Zeckelman.

33:50.520 --> 33:55.860
Can you leave please?
Do you want to win this trial?

33:55.860 --> 33:57.819
- Yes.
- Stop naming my baby.

33:59.739 --> 34:00.905
Okay.

34:01.657 --> 34:03.241
And you didn't like Foots?

34:14.670 --> 34:16.379
Tell me you got something good.

34:16.838 --> 34:18.673
- I got the goods.
- Yeah?

34:19.258 --> 34:22.219
Got something that's gonna
get us out of this mess.

34:22.219 --> 34:24.013
All right, I'm all ears.

34:24.013 --> 34:28.099
By the way, the fish is dead. FYI.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.727
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:30.393 --> 34:31.854
You know, in a weird way,

34:34.148 --> 34:36.941
I kind of feel like
me and you are that little fish.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.362
We just want to swim and enjoy
our day, but we're stuck in that filter.

34:41.989 --> 34:44.240
That's true.
We're like the fish.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.575
We're stuck fish.

34:45.575 --> 34:48.870
Squirming, screaming for help,
but trapped.

34:49.246 --> 34:51.247
Not sick. Stuck.

34:51.247 --> 34:52.416
Just stuck.

34:52.416 --> 34:55.294
But if you stay stuck too long,
you're gonna get sick,

34:55.294 --> 34:57.462
and then you're gonna die.

34:57.462 --> 35:02.885
Maybe in some small way the fish
lives on through us being free.

35:03.678 --> 35:05.804
Guess what?
We're getting out of that filter.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.431
- Are you ready?
- Can you make us unstuck?

35:08.431 --> 35:10.726
Oh yeah. So here's the deal.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.442
I've got something to tell you.

35:21.821 --> 35:24.281
I got something
that I got to tell you.

35:24.949 --> 35:26.367
What, Freddy?

35:26.367 --> 35:27.784
It's medical.

35:31.205 --> 35:33.332
It's a medical thing,
and it's getting worse.

35:34.708 --> 35:35.960
Don't do that.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.004
Freddy, your hand.

35:38.004 --> 35:40.755
It's called Groat's disease.

35:40.755 --> 35:42.216
I have Groat's disease.

35:42.717 --> 35:44.719
It affects the nervous system

35:44.719 --> 35:49.222
and eventually I become incontinent,
and you can't even sit.

35:49.222 --> 35:51.559
The shaking is the tip of the iceberg.

35:51.559 --> 35:56.020
I have to sleep on my knees,
and I need 24-hour care.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.481
And you'll have to hold my penis
when I pee.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.657
I just can't.

36:06.657 --> 36:08.908
The stents and the shunts
and the ports,

36:08.908 --> 36:10.911
and I hear the word hospice...

36:10.911 --> 36:14.289
- I can't.
- I'm distraught, but I understand.

36:14.289 --> 36:17.792
- I'm so glad you do.
- Go live your beautiful life.

36:17.792 --> 36:21.255
Thank you. I can't. I just couldn't
do it again, you know?

36:21.255 --> 36:25.717
Okay, okay.
So take off. Yeah, you should go.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.219
Oh, you know what?
I really like that scarf.

36:28.219 --> 36:30.972
- What, this?
- I's got a button, and it heats up?

36:30.972 --> 36:32.850
- It keeps your neck warm.
- You like it?

36:32.850 --> 36:35.101
- Yeah, it's nice.
- Please, take it.

36:35.101 --> 36:38.229
- Please, no.
- You got to charge it.

36:38.229 --> 36:41.150
- What? Really? Oh my gosh.
- It's the least I can do.

36:41.150 --> 36:44.944
You press the little button there.
Yeah, that's gonna comfort you.

36:44.944 --> 36:49.032
Keep your thyroid warm.
I feel so bad, but...

36:50.283 --> 36:53.286
- Yeah, so go.
- Anal leak... I can't do it.

36:53.286 --> 36:59.542
I'm sorry. It's latex gloves.
It's secretions. It's anal leakage.

36:59.542 --> 37:03.671
- Yeah, just go.
- You're better off without me. Sorry.

37:03.671 --> 37:08.426
Yeah, get the hell out of here.
Go! Please, go!

37:08.426 --> 37:12.848
Go. Going. Going!

37:13.974 --> 37:16.351
Gone!

37:20.064 --> 37:22.482
Yeah!

37:26.111 --> 37:29.906
<i>I have a structured settlement,
and I need cash now,</i>

37:29.906 --> 37:33.993
<i>Call J.G. Wentworth,
877-CASH-NOW!</i>

37:43.087 --> 37:46.923
Hello there. Welcome to the most
magical store at the mall.

37:47.383 --> 37:52.637
Goodbye. They can't order you
to stop dreaming. Thank you.

37:52.637 --> 37:55.016
- Hello, princess!
- Hi, sweetheart.

37:55.016 --> 37:58.017
Do you have the Mickey Mouse
oven gloves?

37:58.017 --> 38:01.563
You put your hands in the mitts,
and then he's got his little hands on...

38:01.563 --> 38:03.106
I'm not sure.
Do you want me to check?

38:03.106 --> 38:06.192
That'd be good. I just left mine
at my boyfriend's house.

38:06.192 --> 38:08.654
We just broke up,
and I don't want to go back there.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.405
I'm so sorry to hear that.

38:10.405 --> 38:14.534
Well, it seems we're both the same.
My happily ever after has ended, too.

38:14.534 --> 38:16.912
- Sucks, right?
- It's awful.

38:16.912 --> 38:18.581
Well, mine was sick.

38:18.581 --> 38:21.792
Well, my Prince Charming was sick.
What a small world.

38:21.792 --> 38:23.084
Yeah. It's a small world.

38:23.084 --> 38:26.546
I don't want to go through the thing
with the degenerative disease he had.

38:26.546 --> 38:30.134
I didn't want to stay by.
I'm too young to deal with all that.

38:30.134 --> 38:32.385
It's a terrible thing,
this Groat's disease.

38:32.802 --> 38:35.013
Wait, what?
Did you say Groat's disease?

38:35.013 --> 38:38.725
That's what my boyfriend, Freddy,
that's what he has. Groat's disease.

38:38.725 --> 38:40.978
- What? Freddy?
- Yeah.

38:41.311 --> 38:43.730
- Freddy who?
- Freddy Funkhauser.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.857
Larry David.

38:46.192 --> 38:48.610
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:48.610 --> 38:51.989
- Can we get some lunch, please?
- I want a sandwich or something.

38:51.989 --> 38:55.701
- They lied to us.
- Oh my God.

38:55.701 --> 38:59.288
- Jenna?
- Hey. Dana. Hello!

39:00.790 --> 39:03.041
You work at the Disney store?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.377
Yeah, I work here.

39:04.835 --> 39:07.505
Then why did you give me notes
on my script?

39:07.505 --> 39:08.838
'Cause Larry David asked me to.

39:08.838 --> 39:12.218
I used them. I got kicked out
of my writers' group.

39:12.802 --> 39:15.178
- Bastards.
- Larry David.

39:15.637 --> 39:17.431
Larry fucking David.

39:17.431 --> 39:19.558
Those fucking pricks.
