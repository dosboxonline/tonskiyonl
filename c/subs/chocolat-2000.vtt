01:45.000 --> 01:46.960
Once upon a time...

01:46.960 --> 01:47.920
there was
a quiet little village...

01:47.920 --> 01:49.880
in the French countryside...

01:50.673 --> 01:53.175
whose people believed
in tranquilite.

01:55.511 --> 01:57.012
Tranquility.

02:00.308 --> 02:01.309
Come Holy Ghost

02:01.308 --> 02:03.518
Creator come

02:04.185 --> 02:06.479
From Thy bright
heavenly throne

02:09.065 --> 02:11.401
Come take possession
of our souls

02:14.904 --> 02:16.989
And make them all Thine own

02:22.662 --> 02:24.622
Far from us drive our...

02:24.914 --> 02:27.084
If you lived in this village...

02:27.125 --> 02:29.878
you understood
what was expected of you.

02:35.883 --> 02:39.136
You knew your
place in the scheme of things.

02:40.679 --> 02:44.141
And if you happened to forget,
someone would help remind you.

02:57.071 --> 02:59.323
The season of Lent is upon us.

02:59.907 --> 03:02.619
This is, of course,
a time of abstinence.

03:03.536 --> 03:06.038
Hopefully,
also a time of reflection.

03:07.914 --> 03:10.501
Above all,
let this be for us a time...

03:12.336 --> 03:14.713
a time of sincere penitence.

03:16.715 --> 03:18.384
it is a time
to stand up and be counted.

03:18.634 --> 03:19.635
In this village...

03:19.760 --> 03:22.804
if you saw something
you weren't supposed to see...

03:24.640 --> 03:26.558
you learned
to look the other way.

03:27.851 --> 03:29.811
This is a time for Christ.

03:29.811 --> 03:32.731
When you reflect,
he knows what you reflect on.

03:31.438 --> 03:32.398
If by chance...

03:32.398 --> 03:34.858
your hopes
had been disappointed...

03:35.816 --> 03:38.236
you learned
never to ask for more.

03:39.195 --> 03:42.032
He knows for what
you must be forgiven.

03:42.615 --> 03:45.410
So in this Year of Our Lord,
1959, things...

03:47.412 --> 03:50.290
So,
through good times and bad...

03:50.290 --> 03:52.083
famine and feast...

03:52.500 --> 03:55.295
the villagers held fast
to their traditions.

03:56.546 --> 03:57.881
Until...

03:57.964 --> 04:01.051
one winter day...

04:00.050 --> 04:02.468
a sly wind
blew in from the north.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.436
Where will we find truth?

04:13.979 --> 04:16.065
Where do we start looking?

04:18.358 --> 04:20.861
We will find it...

05:20.962 --> 05:22.839
Who the hell are you?

05:22.881 --> 05:24.298
Oh, uh...

05:25.133 --> 05:27.427
We're here about the patisserie.

05:28.803 --> 05:30.764
We'd like to rent it...

05:30.764 --> 05:32.682
and the apartment above.

05:33.016 --> 05:34.809
Where are you from?

05:34.851 --> 05:37.479
Well, we lived in Andalucia
for a while.

05:38.855 --> 05:41.275
Let me see.
Before that, Vienna...

05:42.650 --> 05:44.943
and before that...

05:46.945 --> 05:48.656
-Athens.
-Pavia.

05:48.697 --> 05:51.033
Pantoufle hated it there.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.077
Pantoufle is her kangaroo.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.619
But he can't hop.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.580
Bad leg. War injury, huh?

06:14.389 --> 06:17.225
I'll expect you to keep it
in good condition.

06:35.368 --> 06:37.705
What a nice town this is.

06:37.788 --> 06:38.747
Don't you think so, Mama?

06:39.247 --> 06:41.041
It's a lovely town.

06:42.751 --> 06:45.671
Mama, Pantoufle wants to know
how long we can stay.

06:47.004 --> 06:49.632
Oh, tell Pantoufle
not to worry.

06:50.883 --> 06:53.261
Time for bed.
What story tonight?

06:54.387 --> 06:57.599
Pantoufle wants to hear
about grandmere and grandpere.

06:58.683 --> 07:00.560
Not tonight, Anouska.

07:01.144 --> 07:03.230
You always say that.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.233
Tell about
grandmere and grandpere.

07:06.899 --> 07:08.401
Not tonight.

07:08.986 --> 07:11.613
How about the princess
and the pirates?

07:12.030 --> 07:13.323
OK.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.743
Prepare to fire!

07:17.743 --> 07:19.495
All hands on deck!

07:19.703 --> 07:21.497
Ready, aim...

07:22.623 --> 07:23.833
fire!

07:25.793 --> 07:28.045
Forgive the intrusion.

07:28.713 --> 07:30.672
it's a pleasure.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.219
Sorry, monsieur.

07:35.219 --> 07:37.388
-Pirate attack.
-Of course.

07:38.139 --> 07:39.140
What is your name?

07:39.140 --> 07:40.933
Anouk. What's yours?

07:41.851 --> 07:44.562
I am the Comte de Reynaud
at your service.

07:44.937 --> 07:46.689
A real one?

07:46.898 --> 07:48.858
Like the Comte de Monte Cristo?

07:48.857 --> 07:51.109
Ah-ah !
He was not a real one.

07:51.192 --> 07:54.195
To what do we owe
the honor of your visit?

07:54.070 --> 07:56.031
Well, as mayor of Lansquenet...

07:56.031 --> 07:57.949
I want to welcome you
to the community...

07:57.949 --> 08:01.202
and to invite you to worship
with us at mass on Sunday.

08:02.663 --> 08:05.832
That's very kind of you,
but actually we don't attend.

08:08.669 --> 08:10.587
We're glad to be
so near the church, though.

08:10.587 --> 08:13.048
We'll enjoy
singing with the bells.

08:13.799 --> 08:16.718
The bells are not intended
as an entertainment, Madame.

08:17.636 --> 08:19.596
They are a solemn call
to worship for-

08:18.387 --> 08:20.264
Mademoiselle.

08:20.305 --> 08:22.057
I beg your pardon?

08:22.765 --> 08:23.724
Mademoiselle.
I've never been married...

08:23.724 --> 08:27.103
but feel free to call me Vianne.

08:29.605 --> 08:32.900
I hope you'll stop by when
I open for business next week.

08:31.983 --> 08:33.193
Yes.

08:34.861 --> 08:38.030
Yes, opening a patisserie
during the holy Lenten fast.

08:39.323 --> 08:41.241
I could imagine better timing.

08:41.241 --> 08:43.995
Oh, but it's not going
to be a patisserie.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.831
Then what do you intend to-

08:45.831 --> 08:46.790
It's a surprise.

08:47.373 --> 08:49.626
It was sweet of you to drop by.

08:57.883 --> 08:58.843
The Comte de Reynaud...

08:58.968 --> 09:03.473
was a student of history,
and therefore a patient man.

09:05.099 --> 09:07.810
He trusted the wisdom
of generations past.

09:09.144 --> 09:12.482
Like his ancestors, he watched
over the little village...

09:13.107 --> 09:15.235
and led by his own example-

09:15.860 --> 09:17.695
hard work, modesty...

09:19.864 --> 09:21.491
self discipline.

09:34.128 --> 09:36.546
I have completed
the 18th Century.

09:39.008 --> 09:40.717
Madame Clairmont.

09:42.802 --> 09:45.639
Your letter to the editor,
Monsieur le Comte.

09:45.597 --> 09:48.517
This paragraph about family
and tradition, it's...

09:49.518 --> 09:51.145
it's beautiful.

09:50.019 --> 09:51.520
Oh ! Ha ha.

09:51.979 --> 09:53.647
Well, thank you.

09:55.398 --> 09:57.275
I value your opinion.

10:04.616 --> 10:05.617
May I ask...

10:05.617 --> 10:08.662
have you been in contact
with your mother recently?

10:10.079 --> 10:11.080
Why?

10:12.457 --> 10:14.375
She seems to have
rented out the patisserie.

10:14.501 --> 10:16.044
Oh.

10:16.711 --> 10:20.799
I haven't talked to my mother
in quite a while.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.051
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to pry.

10:23.051 --> 10:24.844
Oh, don't be silly.

10:25.969 --> 10:28.055
I have no secrets from you.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.935
How is the comtesse
enjoying Venice?

10:33.977 --> 10:36.605
The comtesse?
Oh, she's fine, thank you.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.857
Yes,
she's enjoying it very much.

10:40.568 --> 10:41.902
Venice.

10:52.997 --> 10:55.749
I heard she was
some kind of radical.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.651
I heard she's an atheist.

11:23.151 --> 11:24.152
What's that?

11:24.236 --> 11:25.696
Don't know.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.039
Come on, Charly.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.336
Come on.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.474
You should be more careful!

12:37.474 --> 12:39.726
-So sorry, Madame.
-I'm sorry.

12:39.976 --> 12:40.936
Are you all right?

12:40.936 --> 12:42.854
I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:42.854 --> 12:45.774
I'm sorry. Do you want
to come in and sit down?

12:45.774 --> 12:47.734
Please don't
trouble yourself. I'm fine.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.654
No, it's no trouble.
I'm Vianne Rocher.

12:50.654 --> 12:51.613
Caroline Clairmont.

12:51.613 --> 12:52.573
I'm the daughter
of your landlady.

12:52.573 --> 12:53.574
This is my son Luc.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.827
Hello.
And this is my Anouk.

12:56.785 --> 12:58.704
Come in, please,
where it's warm.

12:59.413 --> 13:00.831
Try this.

13:01.332 --> 13:02.291
I bet you've never
had hot chocolate...

13:02.290 --> 13:04.709
made from
a 2,000-year-old recipe.

13:05.626 --> 13:07.587
Thank you, but no. Luc.

13:07.170 --> 13:08.713
No.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.759
What's this?

13:13.801 --> 13:15.720
What do you see, Madame,
in this?

13:15.720 --> 13:16.721
Sorry?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.848
What does it look like to you?

13:17.848 --> 13:20.934
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.188
Um...

13:26.356 --> 13:28.274
A woman riding a wild horse?

13:28.358 --> 13:29.359
Ha !

13:30.651 --> 13:32.570
-Ooh !
-Oh, silly answer.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.530
Oh, no.
There are no silly answers.

13:33.238 --> 13:35.156
The pepper triangle,
that's for you.

13:36.156 --> 13:38.117
A tiny hint of chili pepper...

13:38.117 --> 13:40.703
to play against the sweetness.

13:41.036 --> 13:42.830
Tangy, adventurous.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.299
What do you see?

13:57.303 --> 13:58.804
I see teeth.

14:00.222 --> 14:02.016
I see blood...

14:02.558 --> 14:04.101
and a skull.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.438
Very dark.

14:09.856 --> 14:11.775
Bitter chocolate.
That's your favorite.

14:12.276 --> 14:14.236
Which will
have to wait five weeks more.

14:14.236 --> 14:15.904
Lent. Thank you.

14:17.406 --> 14:20.284
We must run along.
It's been nice to meet you.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.162
My pleasure.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.331
Pantoufle, come on!
Pirate attack!

14:26.874 --> 14:29.793
How much are
those chili things, please?

14:29.168 --> 14:30.961
4.50 a box.

14:31.128 --> 14:33.047
Could you put a ribbon on it?

14:33.047 --> 14:34.048
Mm-hmm.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.799
Then I can pretend
they are from my husband.

14:34.799 --> 14:36.216
Of course.

14:42.513 --> 14:44.473
Josephine Muscat.

14:44.974 --> 14:47.101
She waltzes to her own tune.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.355
And these are for your husband-

14:52.691 --> 14:55.151
unrefined coco nips
from Guatemala-

14:55.610 --> 14:57.529
to awaken the passions.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.450
You've obviously
never met my husband.

15:02.116 --> 15:04.369
You've obviously
never tried these.

15:26.515 --> 15:28.267
Don't be pathetic.

15:54.417 --> 15:55.377
Luc.

15:55.377 --> 15:58.130
You've got a tiny error
in problem six-Oh!

15:58.296 --> 15:59.673
Luc! Oh.

16:01.341 --> 16:02.885
It's nothing.

16:05.804 --> 16:07.598
It already stopped.

16:08.056 --> 16:10.100
Mother, the new teacher...

16:10.975 --> 16:12.894
wants us to correct
our own mistakes.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.689
I didn't tell you
how to correct the mistake...

16:16.689 --> 16:19.108
I just told you
that you made one.

17:37.978 --> 17:38.979
Not hungry, Monsieur le Comte?

17:38.979 --> 17:41.190
The Lenten fast, Madame Rivet.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.735
Are you not supposed
to eat something?

17:47.027 --> 17:49.072
It's all right. Leave it.

18:45.961 --> 18:47.547
Hello.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.590
May I help you?

18:52.509 --> 18:54.969
It's expensive.
I don't waste money.

18:55.804 --> 18:58.723
I have a knack for
guessing people's favorites.

19:00.850 --> 19:03.395
These are your favorites.
Am I right?

19:04.854 --> 19:06.856
On the house.

19:18.035 --> 19:20.329
I think I'd better-

19:20.787 --> 19:22.371
Well...

19:22.455 --> 19:25.166
This certainly is different.

19:23.832 --> 19:24.791
Yes. Very different.

19:24.874 --> 19:26.710
Look at that.

19:29.838 --> 19:30.797
Oh !

19:30.797 --> 19:32.506
Oh. I'm so sorry.

19:34.008 --> 19:35.009
Bonjour, Monsieur Blerot.

19:35.009 --> 19:36.886
Bonjour, Madame Audel.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.236
No. Not that way, Charly.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.154
Come on.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.781
Come in ! Please.

19:57.865 --> 19:58.824
Come on, boy.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.035
I've got something for you.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.709
What's your name?

20:08.709 --> 20:11.462
Charly.
He's fourteen years old.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.839
That's ninety-eight
in human years.

20:14.298 --> 20:16.217
No, I meant your name.

20:16.259 --> 20:18.177
Oh ! Guillaume Blerot.

20:19.262 --> 20:20.972
You're very kind.

20:21.222 --> 20:23.391
He has so few pleasures left.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.309
Would you care...

20:26.643 --> 20:27.644
Would you care to buy...

20:29.938 --> 20:32.524
something special
for your lady friend?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.859
Lady friend?

20:34.067 --> 20:37.070
The lovely woman
your dog was so fond of,

20:37.946 --> 20:38.947
Oh.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.949
Her favorite
is chocolate seashells.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.950
That's my guess.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.994
Oh, no. I mustn't.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.998
Madame Audel is in mourning
for her husband.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.167
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.419
When did he pass away?

20:52.044 --> 20:54.004
The war. German grenade.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.255
Hmm.

20:56.964 --> 21:00.009
Well, it's been fifteen years
since the war, so...

21:00.385 --> 21:02.970
Not that war.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.890
Monsieur Audel was killed
on January 12, 1917.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.935
It was quite a blow
to Madame Audel.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.229
Apparently so.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.148
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.235
Bonjour, Mesdames!

21:17.402 --> 21:19.696
Bonjour, Monsieur le Comte.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.536
I wish all my tenants...

21:26.535 --> 21:29.038
were as reliable as you,
Madame Drou.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.583
How is the comtesse
enjoying ltaly?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.964
Uh...She may be
extending her trip.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.799
Ah, very nice.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.847
Have either of you seen
the new shop across the square?

21:46.347 --> 21:48.265
The chocolaterie? Yes.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.685
Shameless, isn't it?

21:52.770 --> 21:54.689
The sheer nerve of the woman...

21:56.107 --> 21:58.943
opening a chocolaterie
just in time for Lent.

22:01.444 --> 22:03.363
The woman is brazen.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.908
My heart
goes out to that poor...

22:07.451 --> 22:09.536
illegitimate child of hers.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.287
Mmm.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.292
Bonjour.

22:19.045 --> 22:21.798
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

22:22.924 --> 22:24.718
Cryin' all the time

22:26.803 --> 22:28.764
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog

22:28.763 --> 22:30.556
Cryin' all the time

22:30.681 --> 22:32.642
Well, you ain't never
caught no rabbit

22:32.642 --> 22:34.560
You ain't no friend of mine

22:34.477 --> 22:35.978
Ooh, yeah !

22:36.437 --> 22:39.065
A new addition to the liturgy?

22:40.984 --> 22:42.944
I have a weakness
for American music...

22:42.944 --> 22:44.695
Monsieur le Comte.

22:44.904 --> 22:46.822
How long have you been with us,
Pere Henri?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.993
It will be five weeks.

22:50.368 --> 22:54.998
Your predecessor, Pere Michel,
he was with us for five decades.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.417
Yes, well...

22:57.834 --> 23:00.921
I only pray I can live up
to Pere Michel's example.

23:01.045 --> 23:02.963
Yes, that's my prayer also.

23:04.256 --> 23:06.967
I looked at your sermon,
as you requested.

23:07.176 --> 23:09.261
I've made one or two notes.

23:13.307 --> 23:15.017
You're very kind.

23:15.475 --> 23:16.936
Not at all.

23:17.311 --> 23:19.104
Oh, one more thing.

23:20.397 --> 23:23.150
If you haven't seen
the new chocolaterie...

23:23.526 --> 23:25.486
perhaps you might
like to take a look.

23:25.486 --> 23:27.905
It's important
to know one's enemy.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.990
Don't you think?

23:32.867 --> 23:35.036
Hey, where's my kiss?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.170
Watch where you're going !
Excuse me!

23:43.462 --> 23:45.089
Hello. Morning.

23:46.548 --> 23:50.135
What's the decor,
Early Mexican Brothel?

24:01.021 --> 24:03.523
No! If I need help,
I'll ask for it.

24:11.781 --> 24:13.700
What do you see in it?

24:13.742 --> 24:15.451
Not a damn thing.

24:15.243 --> 24:17.120
Come on. It's a game.

24:17.203 --> 24:19.163
What do you see?

24:19.623 --> 24:22.541
I see a cranky old woman
too tired to play games.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.796
Hmm. I've got
just the thing for you.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.800
That little girl
of yours, does she mind it?

24:31.926 --> 24:33.386
Mind what?

24:33.887 --> 24:36.556
The way you move her
from place to place.

24:35.388 --> 24:39.433
Oh. She's doing fine.
I think it's good for her.

24:41.143 --> 24:43.937
Seeing new places,
meeting new people.

24:47.483 --> 24:49.568
Your cinnamon looks rancid.

24:50.278 --> 24:51.237
Well, it's not cinnamon.

24:51.237 --> 24:53.739
It's a special kind
of chili pepper.

24:53.781 --> 24:54.740
Chili pepper in hot chocolate?

24:56.242 --> 24:58.827
Mm-hmm.
it'll give you a lift .

25:19.472 --> 25:21.183
It tastes like...

25:23.185 --> 25:24.728
I don't know.

25:35.322 --> 25:37.282
Hop, hop, hop!
I'm your kangaroo now!

25:39.200 --> 25:40.577
Stop it!

25:41.160 --> 25:42.745
Stop it! Unh !

25:45.081 --> 25:46.999
Anouk! In this school,
we are civilized.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.960
We do not strike one another!

25:49.877 --> 25:51.838
But they insulted Pantoufle!

25:51.838 --> 25:54.757
I don't care.
Didi, Dedou, come along !

25:57.218 --> 25:59.136
And be quiet.

26:01.138 --> 26:02.890
Where's Pantoufle?

26:06.394 --> 26:09.021
My mother says
you don't have a father.

26:10.106 --> 26:11.523
Sure I do.

26:12.149 --> 26:14.318
We just don't know who he is.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.653
I was out all night with him.

26:16.653 --> 26:18.822
We swam naked in the Tannes.

26:21.783 --> 26:24.703
At dawn, when I returned
to my house in my bed...

26:24.912 --> 26:27.498
my mother poked her head
in and said...

26:27.789 --> 26:29.750
"Wake up sleepyhead."

26:30.918 --> 26:32.879
She had no idea I'd been gone.

26:50.436 --> 26:52.898
Sure you didn't
put booze in there?

26:53.439 --> 26:55.358
Nah. Something better.

26:56.401 --> 26:59.112
Perhaps you should
give it to my daughter.

26:58.945 --> 27:01.782
Melt that chilly
disposition of hers.

27:01.865 --> 27:03.784
You and Caroline have a problem?

27:03.784 --> 27:05.661
Do we have a problem?

27:08.038 --> 27:10.416
She won't let me
see my grandson.

27:10.957 --> 27:12.793
I'm cut off from him.

27:14.084 --> 27:15.920
Why is that?

27:16.629 --> 27:18.506
Armande, why is that?

27:19.715 --> 27:21.676
Oh, I'm a bad influence.

27:22.093 --> 27:25.471
'Cause I don't like her treating
him like a trained poodle.

27:26.431 --> 27:29.642
I swear, that boy doesn't piss
without her permission.

27:33.229 --> 27:35.190
Ever since her husband died...

27:35.190 --> 27:36.858
she's been so...

27:42.197 --> 27:44.950
The way she frets
and fusses over that boy.

27:45.490 --> 27:47.451
If only she'd let him run,
let him breathe...

27:47.451 --> 27:48.994
let him live.

27:50.037 --> 27:52.957
But she worries
that he will overexert himself.

27:55.209 --> 27:57.211
Not much danger of that.

27:57.294 --> 28:00.214
She won't even let
the poor kid ride a bicycle.

28:01.591 --> 28:04.009
Do you think
he'd like to see you?

28:07.304 --> 28:10.224
Do you have more of
those bean thingies, please?

28:10.057 --> 28:11.434
Oh, sure.

28:13.644 --> 28:15.605
How many do you want?

28:15.604 --> 28:17.522
How many have you got?

28:21.526 --> 28:23.487
Jack of hearts is a better
hunter than you, eh?

28:23.487 --> 28:26.406
Shoots the trump
from right out under your nose.

28:39.044 --> 28:40.920
Are you Serge Muscat?

28:41.005 --> 28:42.923
The one and only.
What's your pleasure?

28:43.507 --> 28:45.800
-Is your wife here?
-Josephine?

28:46.926 --> 28:49.762
Well, it depends what
you want with Josephine.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.765
Oh, she left this at my shop.

28:54.308 --> 28:57.020
Well, let me have it.
I'll give it to her.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.857
Oh, no. I'll give it
to her myself, thanks.

29:04.694 --> 29:07.321
But the game's not over yet.

29:08.197 --> 29:10.033
Do you want to play?

29:10.659 --> 29:12.326
You know Belote?

29:12.577 --> 29:14.203
Of course I do.

29:14.746 --> 29:16.164
Sit down.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.042
Josephine.

29:22.127 --> 29:23.837
What do you want?

29:25.047 --> 29:26.006
You forgot this.

29:26.424 --> 29:28.133
What do you want?

29:29.677 --> 29:31.429
To be your friend.

29:31.929 --> 29:34.973
I don't have friends.
Does Serge know you're here?

29:35.724 --> 29:37.351
Does it matter?

29:38.352 --> 29:41.147
Do me a favor.
Try one of these rose creams.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.484
Tell me if you think it's
a little heavy on the Cointreau.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.042
Josephine!

30:09.883 --> 30:11.384
I'm coming !

30:12.510 --> 30:14.722
He talks about you.

30:15.097 --> 30:16.098
He says you're indecent.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.140
He says you're an influence.

30:18.475 --> 30:21.269
You're a bad influence
for someone like me-

30:19.977 --> 30:22.896
I don't have to listen to a word
your husband has to say.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.607
No, not Serge.

30:26.107 --> 30:27.484
Not him.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.319
Reynaud, the mayor.

30:31.237 --> 30:33.239
He...he talks about you.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.831
Time to go.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.542
Look what I won.

30:45.335 --> 30:47.212
That's good. Come on.

31:18.450 --> 31:20.536
Luc, mind if I take a peek?

31:20.661 --> 31:22.830
Oh, um...
It's not really...

31:23.580 --> 31:24.540
Show me.

31:27.542 --> 31:30.253
Well, I exaggerated
the angle of the head.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.505
You draw beautifully.

31:32.881 --> 31:34.841
What's your going rate?

31:34.966 --> 31:35.926
What?

31:35.634 --> 31:37.343
To do a portrait.

31:37.594 --> 31:39.513
How much would you charge?

31:39.513 --> 31:40.514
Oh, I...

31:41.473 --> 31:43.767
I couldn't.
I'm not really a...

31:45.143 --> 31:47.438
Fifty francs?
Sound reasonable?

31:48.772 --> 31:49.731
lt'd be great.

31:51.191 --> 31:53.444
When could you come by my shop?

31:55.362 --> 31:57.281
I'm-I'm really sorry, but...

31:57.363 --> 31:59.240
the comte forbids it.

32:04.829 --> 32:06.789
He spoke to Mama this morning...

32:06.789 --> 32:08.583
and a lot of others.

32:12.128 --> 32:13.838
Whatever you say.

32:14.255 --> 32:16.382
I wish I could. I really do.

32:19.094 --> 32:21.554
Thanks for showing me
your drawing.

32:27.601 --> 32:28.811
Wait.

32:47.329 --> 32:49.248
Am I breaking any laws?

32:50.332 --> 32:52.543
Tell me?
Am I hurting anyone?

32:53.919 --> 32:55.838
You're asking me my opinion?

32:56.255 --> 32:59.342
What exactly have you been
telling people about me?

32:59.758 --> 33:01.926
Only the truth, mademoiselle.

33:02.051 --> 33:03.387
Well...

33:04.012 --> 33:05.972
if you're expecting me...

33:05.972 --> 33:08.392
to just shrivel up
and blow away...

33:10.352 --> 33:12.937
you're going to be
highly disappointed.

33:19.403 --> 33:22.322
Let me try and put this
into perspective for you.

33:23.032 --> 33:25.617
The first Comte de Reynaud...

33:25.950 --> 33:29.121
expelled all the radical
Huguenots from this village.

33:29.038 --> 33:32.207
You and your truffles
present a far lesser challenge.

33:35.376 --> 33:38.171
You'll be
out of business by Easter.

33:38.963 --> 33:40.756
I promise you that.

34:08.992 --> 34:11.829
How long have you
been standing here?

34:13.664 --> 34:16.583
I forgot to pay you
for something the other day.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.585
I'm sorry.
No, it was a gift.

34:18.835 --> 34:20.545
No. People talk.

34:22.547 --> 34:24.757
No, people would lie about me.

34:26.302 --> 34:27.886
I don't steal.

34:28.221 --> 34:30.013
Not on purpose. I-

34:31.556 --> 34:33.391
Yes, I know.

34:34.559 --> 34:36.436
It's nice to see you.

34:37.353 --> 34:40.190
Would you like to come in
for some chocolate?

34:52.409 --> 34:54.079
This is for you.

34:54.329 --> 34:55.330
How sweet of you.

34:56.831 --> 34:58.583
Thank you.

35:02.295 --> 35:04.006
Hmm, it's lovely.

35:08.593 --> 35:10.845
I heard you don't go to church.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.723
That's right.

35:15.391 --> 35:17.393
You won't last long here.

35:19.270 --> 35:21.188
People talk.

35:23.733 --> 35:25.192
Oh, sorry.

35:25.693 --> 35:27.654
I'm behaving badly, aren't I?

35:27.654 --> 35:28.613
No, it's OK.

35:28.988 --> 35:31.449
You don't misbehave here.

35:31.908 --> 35:34.452
It's just not done,
did you know that?

35:35.036 --> 35:36.954
If you don't go to Confession...

35:38.747 --> 35:41.375
or if you don't
dig your flower beds...

35:41.667 --> 35:43.752
or if you don't pretend...

35:45.546 --> 35:48.257
that you want nothing
more in your life...

35:48.465 --> 35:50.384
than to serve your husband
three meals a day...

35:50.509 --> 35:53.429
and give him children
and vacuum under his ass...

35:54.430 --> 35:56.432
then-then you're crazy.

36:04.315 --> 36:07.068
You must think I'm stupid
to stay with him.

36:10.528 --> 36:12.823
No, I don't think you're stupid.

36:13.699 --> 36:15.575
Well, I am. I'm weak.

36:16.743 --> 36:19.162
I don't love my husband,
and I lie.

36:22.583 --> 36:25.418
Things could be different
for you, Josephine.

36:26.377 --> 36:28.505
Serge doesn't run the world.

36:29.881 --> 36:32.133
He might as well.

36:32.426 --> 36:34.345
Is that what you believe?

36:34.345 --> 36:35.804
I know it.

36:38.849 --> 36:40.726
Then it must be true.

36:42.059 --> 36:43.519
My mistake.

36:49.066 --> 36:51.652
You make the most
wonderful chocolate.

36:58.701 --> 37:00.661
Pantoufle wants
to hear the story...

37:00.661 --> 37:01.621
of grandmere and grandpere.

37:01.621 --> 37:02.872
Ohh !

37:03.206 --> 37:06.626
Don't say, "Not tonight."
You always say, "Not tonight."

37:07.752 --> 37:09.629
All right, all right.

37:14.258 --> 37:16.051
Your grandfather...

37:16.218 --> 37:17.887
George Rocher...

37:19.346 --> 37:22.599
was the young apothecary
of the town of Aulus-les-Bains.

37:23.976 --> 37:28.272
it was Anouk's favorite story.
Always told in the same words.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.817
George was honest,
prosperous...

37:33.193 --> 37:35.362
and trusted by his customers.

37:36.113 --> 37:38.198
But George was not content.

37:38.616 --> 37:40.535
He felt there
should be more to life...

37:40.535 --> 37:42.620
than dispensing liver oil.

37:45.038 --> 37:47.040
In the spring of 1927...

37:47.957 --> 37:49.918
the Societe Pharmeceutique...

37:49.918 --> 37:52.587
formed an expedition
to Central America...

37:52.837 --> 37:54.798
to study
the medicinal properties...

37:54.798 --> 37:56.925
of certain natural compounds.

37:59.344 --> 38:02.347
George was the expedition's
most eager volunteer.

38:05.975 --> 38:08.937
But his adventure
took a turn he did not expect.

38:12.774 --> 38:15.902
One night, he was invited
to drink unrefined cacao...

38:16.652 --> 38:18.529
with a pinch of chili.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.782
The very same drink
the ancient Maya...

38:22.491 --> 38:24.828
used in their sacred
ceremonies.

38:27.121 --> 38:29.833
The Maya believed
cacao held the power...

38:30.041 --> 38:32.251
to unlock hidden yearnings...

38:34.879 --> 38:36.715
and reveal destinies.

38:40.343 --> 38:44.222
And so it was
that George first saw Chitza.

38:49.602 --> 38:52.480
Now, George had been raised
a good Catholic...

38:53.731 --> 38:56.108
but in his romance
with Chitza...

38:57.610 --> 38:59.570
he was willing
to slightly bend the rules...

38:59.570 --> 39:01.489
of Christian courtship.

39:02.531 --> 39:05.451
The tribal elders
tried to warn George about her.

39:06.076 --> 39:08.204
She was one of the wanderers.

39:08.787 --> 39:10.706
Her people moved
with the North Wind...

39:10.706 --> 39:12.666
from village to village...

39:13.083 --> 39:15.294
dispensing ancient remedies...

39:16.003 --> 39:17.838
never settling down.

39:18.255 --> 39:20.465
Not a good choice for a bride.

39:21.841 --> 39:24.302
George did not
heed their warning...

39:25.845 --> 39:27.764
and for a while,
it seemed that he and Chitza...

39:27.764 --> 39:30.517
might lead a happy life
together in France.

39:32.602 --> 39:36.148
Alas, the clever North Wind
had ot her plans.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.617
One morning,
George awoke to discover...

39:48.660 --> 39:51.328
that Chitza
and the little girl Vianne...

39:51.578 --> 39:53.164
had gone away.

39:57.126 --> 39:59.045
Mother and daughter...

40:00.379 --> 40:03.299
were fated to wander
from village to village...

40:03.299 --> 40:05.802
dispensing
ancient cacao remedies...

40:05.968 --> 40:07.970
traveling with the wind.

40:09.556 --> 40:11.516
Just as Chitza's people
had done...

40:11.516 --> 40:12.475
for generations.

40:12.475 --> 40:14.894
Just as Chitza's people...

40:15.395 --> 40:17.439
had done for generations.

40:20.191 --> 40:22.276
Will it just go on forever?

40:28.532 --> 40:31.034
Night, Mama.

40:47.676 --> 40:49.595
I appreciate your coming in,
Armande.

40:50.304 --> 40:53.349
What's so important
that I had to postpone my nap?

40:54.557 --> 40:56.727
I've got some chocolate cake.

41:07.821 --> 41:08.780
Grandmother.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.699
Grandmother...bonjour.

41:14.410 --> 41:15.787
May I...

41:19.082 --> 41:21.042
Would you like a cup of...?

41:20.959 --> 41:22.544
No, thank you.

41:22.877 --> 41:25.129
I'm just here to do a portrait.

41:26.464 --> 41:27.465
Mm-hmm.

41:27.465 --> 41:28.716
Whose?

41:29.300 --> 41:30.968
Yours, actually.

41:32.177 --> 41:34.972
Is the light OK
where she's sitting?

41:39.727 --> 41:41.937
I have something for you, boy.

41:43.106 --> 41:46.317
I've been carrying it around
since your last birthday.

41:49.612 --> 41:51.531
It's a book of poetry.

41:54.992 --> 41:56.160
Oh.

41:56.952 --> 41:58.370
Thank you.

41:59.246 --> 42:01.165
You don't like poetry?

42:02.166 --> 42:04.126
Oh, no. Of course I do.

42:04.126 --> 42:05.335
Yes.

42:05.544 --> 42:07.129
Neither do I.

42:08.463 --> 42:10.632
It's not that kind of poetry.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.931
And in a moment of weakness...

42:17.640 --> 42:19.600
I prayed to the Virgin Mother...

42:19.600 --> 42:22.477
to soothe Charly's soul
in his hour of suffering.

42:23.688 --> 42:27.733
You understand an animal
has no immortal soul.

42:28.775 --> 42:30.735
I understand, mon pere.

42:30.819 --> 42:32.779
Yet you flout God's law.

42:33.905 --> 42:36.282
I'm weak and a sinner.

42:36.616 --> 42:38.285
What else?

42:40.579 --> 42:42.247
lmpure thoughts.

42:43.915 --> 42:45.834
The woman
who runs the chocolaterie.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.461
Vianne Rocher?

42:47.794 --> 42:49.754
She suggested
I buy chocolate seashells...

42:49.838 --> 42:52.299
for the widow Audel.

42:53.007 --> 42:55.052
And, well...

42:55.052 --> 42:57.971
I guess that got me to thinking
about the widow Audel.

42:58.762 --> 43:00.764
At her age? At your age?

43:02.600 --> 43:04.143
Yes. And yes.

43:06.854 --> 43:10.274
And just what were you doing
in a chocolaterie during Lent?

43:11.442 --> 43:13.194
It was for Charly.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.405
Again you flout God's law.

43:19.117 --> 43:21.535
Well, but if Charly
has no soul...

43:24.080 --> 43:26.791
then there's no harm
in him breaking Lent.

43:28.250 --> 43:30.711
Isn't that so, mon pere?

43:32.045 --> 43:34.507
Ten Hail Marys,
twenty Our Fathers.

43:36.509 --> 43:38.427
"Will she never have done,
then...

43:38.844 --> 43:42.347
"that ghoul queen of
a million dead bodies?

43:43.599 --> 43:45.518
"I see myseIf again...

43:46.143 --> 43:48.562
"skin rotten
with mud and pest...

43:49.355 --> 43:52.733
"worms in my armpits
and in my hair."

43:54.277 --> 43:56.237
It's perfectly wretched,
isn't it?

43:56.237 --> 43:57.655
Perfectly.

44:01.699 --> 44:04.077
Would you like some cake?

44:05.995 --> 44:08.081
Ahem. I'm not supposed to.

44:08.915 --> 44:11.626
Don't worry so much
about not supposed to.

44:18.633 --> 44:20.177
Hmm?

44:20.010 --> 44:21.594
Live a little.

44:24.890 --> 44:27.475
Oh, her hair appointment's
almost done.

44:28.936 --> 44:29.937
I have to go.

44:29.937 --> 44:32.355
-What about my picture?
-Next time.

44:35.274 --> 44:37.443
Thank you for the cake.

44:40.655 --> 44:43.616
Don't look so damn pleased
with yourself.

44:52.041 --> 44:53.501
Stay here.

45:01.384 --> 45:03.595
I did it.

45:04.678 --> 45:06.305
I did it. He...

45:07.889 --> 45:09.558
He was so drunk.

45:12.144 --> 45:14.020
He woke up.

45:14.313 --> 45:16.815
He woke up.
He saw me packing, but...

45:17.358 --> 45:19.276
So he tried to come after me...

45:19.276 --> 45:22.196
but I had already tied his feet
with his belt, and...

45:22.196 --> 45:23.822
Ha ha ha ha ha.

45:27.076 --> 45:29.078
Boom ! Right on his face.

45:31.038 --> 45:33.415
Right there
on his big, red face.

45:45.260 --> 45:47.345
It is so stupid, isn't it?

45:49.305 --> 45:51.057
I never blame him.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.186
Sometimes I even forget
what really happened.

46:00.150 --> 46:02.027
Now, now, now.

46:06.947 --> 46:08.449
Shh.

46:09.158 --> 46:10.117
I saved her!

46:10.410 --> 46:13.329
You remember her father
collaborated with the Germans?

46:14.455 --> 46:17.166
Nobody wanted to touch her.
Except for me.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.919
And this is the way
she repays me?!

46:20.170 --> 46:22.087
Your anger is understandable.

46:21.796 --> 46:23.756
Anger?
Everybody's laughing at me!

46:23.756 --> 46:25.716
That is not your concern.

46:26.301 --> 46:29.011
Your concern is
the sacrament of marriage.

46:30.012 --> 46:32.557
Yeah, of course.
The sacrament.

46:32.932 --> 46:35.893
Dip the ganshbe
into the white chocolate.

46:37.020 --> 46:37.979
Like this?

46:37.978 --> 46:40.230
Good.
Yes, shake it, a little.

46:41.856 --> 46:42.858
Good.

46:42.858 --> 46:44.776
Put it on the parchment sheet.

46:45.945 --> 46:47.737
You're doing great.

46:50.324 --> 46:52.284
Oh. I'll be right back.

47:00.042 --> 47:01.752
Oh. Good morning.

47:01.501 --> 47:04.296
Can I interest you
in some Nipples of Venus?

47:05.380 --> 47:08.300
Rumor has it that you are
harboring Madame Muscat.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.219
Is that true?

47:10.259 --> 47:12.428
You make her sound
like a fugitive.

47:12.178 --> 47:14.388
She is a fugitive,
from her marriage vows...

47:14.639 --> 47:17.058
which have been
sanctified by God.

47:18.727 --> 47:20.144
Josephine?

47:20.645 --> 47:22.939
Come out here a minute.

47:26.109 --> 47:28.778
Let His Radiance
have a look at you, hmm?

47:34.075 --> 47:36.745
Is that sanctified
enough for you?

47:36.995 --> 47:37.954
it's not the first time.

47:38.163 --> 47:39.831
I'm truly sorry.

47:41.957 --> 47:44.460
You should have come to me.

47:45.044 --> 47:47.880
Your husband will be made
to repent for this.

47:48.381 --> 47:51.885
Tell him to repent
on someone else's head.

47:52.176 --> 47:53.177
Come on. In !

47:54.095 --> 47:55.054
Monsieur le Comte!

47:55.054 --> 47:57.556
I'm going to make
an example of you.

48:00.476 --> 48:02.353
In there. He's ready.

48:02.061 --> 48:03.980
Well, but confession
must be made...

48:03.897 --> 48:06.065
in the spirit of contrition.

48:06.107 --> 48:08.067
Have you come
in the spirit of contrition?

48:08.067 --> 48:09.027
Contrition, yes.

48:10.153 --> 48:11.655
He's ready.

48:14.531 --> 48:17.409
Licentiousness,
idolatry, sorcery...

48:18.410 --> 48:20.328
gluttony, and drunkenness.

48:20.913 --> 48:22.289
Correct.

48:23.081 --> 48:26.084
And what are the three
conditions for mortal sin?

48:26.960 --> 48:28.253
Serge?

48:29.337 --> 48:30.881
Mortal sin...

48:32.716 --> 48:36.219
is sin whose object is...

48:37.888 --> 48:39.515
committed by...

48:39.848 --> 48:41.850
deliberate...consequence.

48:42.726 --> 48:44.395
Incorrect. Didi?

48:45.520 --> 48:48.440
Mortal sin is sin
whose object is grave matter...

48:51.025 --> 48:52.985
which is committed
with full knowledge...

48:52.985 --> 48:54.904
and deliberate consent.

48:54.404 --> 48:55.363
Correct.

49:05.498 --> 49:06.458
So, how do you know...

49:06.458 --> 49:08.418
if the coverture
is properly tempered?

49:09.211 --> 49:12.464
You check to see
if it's at body temperature.

49:14.757 --> 49:16.675
Then you dip
the palette knife...

49:17.176 --> 49:20.096
to see that the coverture
hardens on it evenly.

49:20.096 --> 49:21.472
Correct.

49:22.724 --> 49:24.058
Closer.

49:28.229 --> 49:30.940
In the village, time passed.

49:36.153 --> 49:39.073
And the chocolaterie
did not go out of business.

49:58.592 --> 50:00.511
The Comte de Reynaud...

50:00.511 --> 50:03.430
felt himself being drawn
into a strange crusade.

50:07.476 --> 50:10.562
His struggle to transform Serge
into a gentleman...

50:11.438 --> 50:13.941
became more
than an act of good will.

50:15.276 --> 50:17.069
it became a test...

50:17.777 --> 50:19.946
a holy war between chateau...

50:22.615 --> 50:24.325
and chocolaterie.

50:46.723 --> 50:48.559
Each time, I...

50:48.684 --> 50:50.602
I tell myself
it's the last time.

50:51.018 --> 50:52.603
But then I...

50:52.978 --> 50:55.356
I get a whiff
of a hot chocolate.

50:55.981 --> 50:57.858
Or those moon things.

50:58.901 --> 50:59.860
Chocolate seashells.

51:00.653 --> 51:02.947
So small, so plain, so innocent.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.701
I thought,
just one little taste...

51:07.160 --> 51:09.036
it can't do any harm.

51:08.619 --> 51:09.579
But it turned out
that they were filled...

51:09.579 --> 51:11.414
with rich, sinful...

51:12.498 --> 51:13.458
Buttery filling...

51:13.166 --> 51:15.126
and it melts,
God forgive me...

51:16.127 --> 51:18.796
it melts ever-so-slowly
on your tongue...

51:19.047 --> 51:21.299
and tortures you with pleasure.

51:21.840 --> 51:23.758
Against You alone,
have I sinned...

51:23.758 --> 51:26.261
and done what is evil
in Your sight.

51:30.307 --> 51:32.434
Indeed I was born guilty...

51:33.227 --> 51:35.771
a sinner when my mother
conceived me.

51:36.271 --> 51:38.899
You desire truth
in the inward being...

51:39.191 --> 51:42.027
therefore teach me wisdom
in my secret heart.

51:45.197 --> 51:47.867
Now, the comte was no fool.

51:47.908 --> 51:49.869
Though he hoped
to redeem Serge...

51:50.244 --> 51:52.162
he knew that
this redemption alone...

51:52.161 --> 51:54.080
would not be enough...

51:54.122 --> 51:56.082
to regain control
over the village.

51:55.915 --> 51:58.543
He understood
that some larger lesson...

51:58.543 --> 52:00.378
needed to be taught.

52:05.258 --> 52:07.176
Some greater problem...

52:07.176 --> 52:10.597
needed to be identified
and solved.

52:14.017 --> 52:17.229
Little did the comte suspect
that his greater problem...

52:17.896 --> 52:19.814
would arrive
one quiet afternoon...

52:20.023 --> 52:22.817
in the dull green waters
of the river Tannes.

52:26.529 --> 52:27.988
You're it!

52:29.448 --> 52:30.908
You're it!

52:31.409 --> 52:32.826
Hey, look!

52:36.289 --> 52:38.041
I'm over here!

52:48.717 --> 52:51.637
You've never really
told me what the problem is...

52:51.637 --> 52:53.597
between you and Caroline.

52:53.014 --> 52:55.599
'Cause it's none of
your damn business.

52:59.144 --> 53:01.689
I'm an embarrassment to her.

53:03.023 --> 53:06.694
I swear, I read dirty books.

53:08.195 --> 53:10.322
I eat and drink what I like.

53:12.533 --> 53:13.534
And sin of sins...

53:13.534 --> 53:17.204
I refuse to go to Les Mimosas.

53:18.414 --> 53:21.542
When I was a kid,
we called it Le Mortoir.

53:22.418 --> 53:24.628
it's a nursing home for old...

53:26.171 --> 53:27.881
It's in Toulouse.

53:29.090 --> 53:30.091
Mmm.

53:29.716 --> 53:31.634
Caroline loves
the thought of a nurse...

53:31.634 --> 53:34.512
with a clipboard
recording my bowel movements.

53:36.598 --> 53:38.850
Mama, Mama, come quick!

53:39.226 --> 53:41.186
They're here!
They've come to Lansquenet!

53:41.186 --> 53:43.813
-Slow down, Anouk. Who's here?
-Pirates!

53:43.396 --> 53:45.648
-Why can't we stay?
-Come on !

53:46.316 --> 53:48.235
But why can't we stay?

53:48.235 --> 53:49.236
OK, enough.

53:49.236 --> 53:51.613
But, Mama,
just a little bit.

53:53.115 --> 53:54.699
Come on.

53:55.617 --> 53:57.744
Hello. How are you?

53:59.661 --> 54:01.580
Anybody got a sweet tooth?

54:21.518 --> 54:23.478
I bet he's the captain.

54:27.399 --> 54:29.609
Anouk, don't do that.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.361
Anouk, don't do that, please.

54:33.153 --> 54:35.113
-How do you do?
-Sorry.

54:35.071 --> 54:36.990
I'd like to apologize.

54:36.407 --> 54:38.450
For all of us. Sincerely.

54:38.909 --> 54:39.910
What for?

54:39.910 --> 54:42.829
For whatever it is
you're here to accuse us of.

54:43.664 --> 54:45.457
Why would I do that?

54:45.707 --> 54:48.877
Well, because we river rats
are the dregs of society.

54:50.129 --> 54:52.964
With horrible diseases
and criminal impulses.

54:53.965 --> 54:55.884
Sounds terrifying.

54:55.884 --> 54:57.386
Is it true?

54:57.428 --> 55:00.722
It's what you townspeople
always seem to think, isn't it?

55:00.806 --> 55:02.766
This is not my town.
Sorry.

55:03.474 --> 55:05.894
Well, then,
what do you want?

55:06.186 --> 55:08.104
Are you here to save us?

55:08.604 --> 55:10.982
Are you
the Catholic Aid Society?

55:10.816 --> 55:13.443
French Family League?
Communist Workers?

55:13.443 --> 55:15.361
Which idea are you selling?

55:14.235 --> 55:15.696
Chocolate.

55:16.112 --> 55:17.072
I'm sorry, chocolate?

55:17.864 --> 55:19.825
What's a river rat?

55:19.825 --> 55:21.660
Is it like a pirate?

55:22.035 --> 55:22.994
Yeah, you could say that.

55:22.994 --> 55:24.454
You could.

55:25.664 --> 55:28.041
Have a look
at my treasure chest.

55:28.584 --> 55:30.043
Oh.

55:30.502 --> 55:32.463
Let me guess, they're for sale.

55:32.462 --> 55:34.379
As a matter of fact,
they are.

55:34.505 --> 55:36.466
For a mere thirty francs apiece.

55:36.466 --> 55:39.301
You laugh? I can get fifty
for them in Paris.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.971
Then go to Paris.

55:49.895 --> 55:51.856
We'll take two, please.

55:51.731 --> 55:52.690
You'll take two?

55:52.690 --> 55:54.609
Yes, please, absolutely.

55:54.609 --> 55:56.026
OK.

55:56.361 --> 55:59.280
I don't know
if I have the right change.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.240
Just a minute.

56:00.865 --> 56:02.617
They're beautiful.

56:02.825 --> 56:04.744
Ireland's finest.

56:04.743 --> 56:04.743
Thanks.

56:04.743 --> 56:06.578
Thank you. Listen...

56:08.163 --> 56:10.082
I should probably warn you.

56:10.374 --> 56:13.668
You make friends with us,
you'll make enemies of others.

56:14.461 --> 56:16.130
That a promise?

56:19.174 --> 56:20.885
It's a guarantee.

56:34.314 --> 56:36.233
What's he up to?

56:36.858 --> 56:39.485
Maybe he's joining the circus.

56:44.032 --> 56:45.867
Sorry, we're closed !

57:00.006 --> 57:02.217
Josephine, you look different.

57:04.178 --> 57:05.637
So do you.

57:08.264 --> 57:11.016
I just want to tell you
that I am so sorry.

57:12.268 --> 57:14.145
For everything.

57:15.188 --> 57:16.897
But I've changed.

57:16.605 --> 57:19.067
You see,
God has made me a new man.

57:21.819 --> 57:23.737
I ask you, I beg you...

57:24.072 --> 57:26.074
please accept my apology.

57:39.461 --> 57:40.879
I accept.

57:44.132 --> 57:47.302
I promise, from now on,
everything will be different.

57:50.263 --> 57:52.891
Everything already
is different, Serge.

57:54.477 --> 57:56.854
Well, I mean,
when you come home.

57:57.395 --> 57:58.606
Home?

58:01.066 --> 58:03.986
Thanks for the apology.
The flowers are lovely.

58:05.529 --> 58:07.490
No, please don't, Josephine.

58:07.490 --> 58:10.117
We are still married
in the eyes of God.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.119
Then he must be blind.

58:19.542 --> 58:22.462
The council
has no legal authority...

58:22.462 --> 58:24.381
to force them to move.

58:24.214 --> 58:26.133
The riverbank is public land.

58:30.845 --> 58:33.306
The mayor wishes
to say a few words.

58:34.432 --> 58:36.268
If I may...

58:36.393 --> 58:38.896
ladies and gentlemen
of the council.

58:38.937 --> 58:43.233
These people are
rootless, godless drifters.

58:44.942 --> 58:46.861
Theirs is the way
of slovenly pleasure.

58:48.445 --> 58:51.573
They would contaminate
the spirit of our quiet town.

58:52.909 --> 58:55.494
The innocence of our children.

58:56.203 --> 58:59.165
Now, the chairman of the council
is quite right.

58:59.081 --> 59:01.292
We cannot force them to leave.

59:03.294 --> 59:05.838
But we can help them
to understand...

59:07.131 --> 59:09.091
that they are not welcome.

59:16.390 --> 59:17.849
Josephine?

59:20.852 --> 59:23.855
Josephine, you think
you can just walk out on me?

59:24.773 --> 59:26.692
You stupid woman!

59:27.318 --> 59:29.986
Worthless cow!
You're nothing without me.

59:30.487 --> 59:32.698
You can't even use a skillet!

59:34.325 --> 59:37.078
Can't even put
a goddamn meal on the table.

59:38.079 --> 59:39.621
He's inside.

59:40.247 --> 59:42.208
He's here. Oh, God.

59:42.208 --> 59:44.418
I need to talk to you.

59:45.126 --> 59:47.378
Please open the door.
I know-

59:47.295 --> 59:49.214
-Mama!
-Come help me!

59:50.173 --> 59:52.050
Open the door.

59:52.133 --> 59:54.803
Open the door.
I just want to talk to you.

59:55.887 --> 59:57.806
Go sleep it off, Serge!

59:57.806 --> 01:00:00.225
Ah, you shut up,
you bitch!

01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:02.602
You've caused enough
trouble already!

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:04.855
You-

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:08.692
Open this door!

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:09.901
Mama !

01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:11.402
Aah ! Aah !

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:12.821
Oh, my God!

01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.533
Stay away from me.

01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:21.161
-Come here now!
-Aah !

01:00:24.415 --> 01:00:26.417
Why, you meddling bitch !

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.591
You-

01:00:46.937 --> 01:00:49.190
Who says I can't use a skillet?

01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:00.492
Bonjour, monsieur.

01:01:00.492 --> 01:01:02.202
Bonjour, monsieur.

01:01:09.209 --> 01:01:10.585
Bonjour.

01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:16.008
Wonderful.

01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:16.676
Come on.

01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:18.928
Up. Come on. Up.

01:01:20.178 --> 01:01:21.512
Come on.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:28.186
His skull can't be
as thick as we thought.

01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:32.857
it was like swatting a fly.

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:41.450
Ohh. The worst is over.

01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:44.786
He found out
what you're made of.

01:01:44.328 --> 01:01:46.079
So did I.

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:50.584
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.629
How long have we got?

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:58.257
She's at the hairdresser
for an hour.

01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:00.634
Fuffi?
Fuffi.

01:02:01.594 --> 01:02:03.471
I'm so sorry, but I have
to break the appointment.

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:04.513
Is something wrong?

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.682
No. I volunteered
to distribute these.

01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:09.602
I promised the comte I'd have
them out by the end of the day.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.354
Count me in.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.482
Not that I expect any of them
to stop by for a hairstyle.

01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:15.566
it's not just that.

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:16.525
The comte feels
we must stand firm.

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:18.486
We cannot trust these people.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.990
Before you know it,
they'll be doing jobs for food.

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:22.948
They'll be begging
at our doors.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.408
Not at this door.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.452
Good, Fuffi, good.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.538
Rub, rub.
Rub harder. Rub.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.209
Rub. Rub.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.965
Rub it. Hard.
Keep your head still.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.595
-Aha!
-Bravo!

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.938
Hello, Caroline.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.530
If you want to
blame someone, blame me-

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.573
corrupting him with cocoa.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.450
Oh, how dare you, Mother.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.537
He's happy. He's fine.
Look at him.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:11.913
Mama, I-

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.498
Well, what about you, Mother?

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.751
Are you fine?

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.255
I bet she has conveniently
forgotten to tell you.

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:21.214
Carol.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.758
Why don't you show them,
Mother?

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.303
Are you afraid to?
Why don't you show?

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:34.977
Insulin shots.

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.938
She has diabetes-
very advanced.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.065
She could be blind
within a year.

01:03:39.481 --> 01:03:41.442
Yeah. Couldn't you
call me a drug addict?

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:43.402
It sounds a lot more glamorous.

01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:45.988
And you-
you sit here feeding her sweets.

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:50.201
There are worse ways to die.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.161
Why don't you
just give her rat poison?

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.120
it would be faster.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.748
Carol has a flair for drama.

01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:58.334
She needs to be in a place
where she can be taken care of.

01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:00.544
Le Mortoir?

01:04:01.002 --> 01:04:02.879
I'd rather be in Hell.

01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:04.881
Ah.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.133
You may get there, Mother.

01:04:08.093 --> 01:04:09.845
Luc, come with me.

01:04:10.053 --> 01:04:11.722
I don't want to.

01:04:12.097 --> 01:04:14.057
He's happy here.
It's good for him.

01:04:14.933 --> 01:04:18.061
I will decide what is good
for my son, Madame Muscat.

01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:30.281
Give me another.

01:04:30.448 --> 01:04:32.367
It's my life.
Let me enjoy what's left of it.

01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:33.368
Fill 'er up.

01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:36.579
Armande, why didn't you tell me?

01:04:36.621 --> 01:04:39.582
Is this a chocolaterie,
or is it a confessional?

01:04:44.087 --> 01:04:46.006
Don't you dare pity me.

01:05:12.907 --> 01:05:14.992
Sorry, we're closed.

01:05:16.076 --> 01:05:18.245
She just wants a soda water.

01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.166
I don't serve animals.

01:05:30.216 --> 01:05:31.467
Right.

01:05:48.859 --> 01:05:50.444
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:05:50.694 --> 01:05:52.654
I just made a fresh
batch of monduon.

01:05:52.654 --> 01:05:54.406
Anybody interested?

01:05:54.573 --> 01:05:55.574
My tummy hurts.

01:05:57.492 --> 01:05:59.453
I've got just the thing
for that. Come in.

01:05:59.453 --> 01:06:02.289
What about boycotting
immorality, then?

01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:04.623
Come in.

01:06:10.004 --> 01:06:11.881
An old remedy.

01:06:12.591 --> 01:06:13.550
From the cocoa tree.

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.426
Tastes strange.

01:06:16.135 --> 01:06:18.054
Mmm. Maybe your daddy
would like a taste.

01:06:18.304 --> 01:06:20.640
He's not my daddy.
He's my pony.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.103
Here. it's a lot
better than those leaves.

01:06:27.564 --> 01:06:29.107
Tastes good.
-Come on.

01:06:30.108 --> 01:06:32.569
Pantoufle wants to meet you.

01:06:33.403 --> 01:06:35.405
He's my kangaroo.

01:06:40.201 --> 01:06:42.370
Go ahead. It's your favorite.

01:06:46.165 --> 01:06:48.126
What makes you so sure?

01:06:48.126 --> 01:06:49.793
Go on. Taste it.

01:06:54.923 --> 01:06:56.134
Hmm.

01:06:56.425 --> 01:06:57.426
That's fantastic.

01:06:57.426 --> 01:06:59.345
Oh, thanks.
I have a knack for guessing.

01:06:59.345 --> 01:07:01.514
It's good-
not my favorite.

01:07:03.391 --> 01:07:04.350
Sorry?

01:07:08.896 --> 01:07:09.855
All right.

01:07:09.855 --> 01:07:11.564
Thanks very much.

01:07:18.488 --> 01:07:20.407
You know, I could fix that,
if you like.

01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:22.325
Not with glass, but...

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.286
I can make you a nice
strong one out of wood.

01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:26.371
That's nice of you...

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.041
but I insist on paying you
for your work.

01:07:29.332 --> 01:07:31.418
That makes two of us, then.

01:07:34.422 --> 01:07:35.881
Bye.

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.551
Thanks again.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.722
She's laughing at us.

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.643
Now she's got one of those
river people working for her.

01:07:49.477 --> 01:07:51.438
Is that a problem?
Christ teaches us-

01:07:51.438 --> 01:07:52.980
Look at this.

01:07:53.773 --> 01:07:56.693
She's soliciting for stalls
and street performers...

01:07:56.693 --> 01:07:59.529
for a fertility celebration
on Easter Sunday.

01:07:59.612 --> 01:08:01.489
She's cackling at us.

01:08:01.573 --> 01:08:04.367
When are you going to do
something about it?

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:06.119
Oh, there.

01:08:08.454 --> 01:08:10.414
What part of Australia
is Pantoufle from?

01:08:10.414 --> 01:08:12.917
A small town
outside of Sydney.

01:08:15.086 --> 01:08:17.004
What does he eat?

01:08:17.212 --> 01:08:19.131
Leaves, bugs...

01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:22.009
and worms, of course.

01:08:22.343 --> 01:08:24.220
What about chocolate?

01:08:24.136 --> 01:08:26.055
Kangaroos don't eat chocolate.

01:08:26.723 --> 01:08:28.599
Has he ever tried it?

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:32.394
Have you ever tried chocolate?

01:08:33.395 --> 01:08:35.189
He's not interested.

01:08:36.691 --> 01:08:39.861
Not interested?
Mr. Pantoufle, you surprise me.

01:08:39.486 --> 01:08:40.487
A world traveler
such as yourself...

01:08:40.486 --> 01:08:42.403
not interested in new flavors?

01:08:42.403 --> 01:08:44.322
You should be ashamed.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.073
I have a very nice
truffle here...

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:48.033
if he wants to try it.

01:08:48.535 --> 01:08:50.578
You're wasting your time.

01:08:51.455 --> 01:08:52.413
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.417
How do you know
you don't like chocolate...

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:57.377
if you refuse to try it?

01:08:57.586 --> 01:08:59.337
Do you like worms?

01:08:59.505 --> 01:09:00.756
What?

01:09:01.673 --> 01:09:03.634
How do you know
if you've never tasted one?

01:09:04.843 --> 01:09:06.136
Ha ha !

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.849
Ah.

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.446
Ew.

01:09:26.197 --> 01:09:27.532
Subtle.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.160
Zesty.

01:09:33.872 --> 01:09:34.831
Disgusting.

01:09:41.837 --> 01:09:43.840
Go on, my little friend.

01:09:44.756 --> 01:09:44.756
Be free.

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:46.676
You tricked me.

01:09:47.968 --> 01:09:49.554
Satan...

01:09:49.554 --> 01:09:51.263
wears many guises.

01:09:52.807 --> 01:09:55.768
At times, Satan is
the singer of a lurid song...

01:09:56.727 --> 01:09:58.646
you hear on the radio.

01:09:58.938 --> 01:10:01.649
At times, the author
of a salacious novel.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:06.153
At times, the quiet man
lurking in the schoolyard...

01:10:06.946 --> 01:10:09.865
asking your children
if he might join their game.

01:10:11.701 --> 01:10:14.370
And at times,
the maker of sweet things-

01:10:15.995 --> 01:10:17.539
mere trifles.

01:10:18.498 --> 01:10:20.417
For what could seem
more harmless...

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.127
more innocent...

01:10:23.087 --> 01:10:24.713
than chocolate?

01:10:29.384 --> 01:10:31.136
A bit of a squeak.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.892
Hey, Guillaume!

01:10:37.184 --> 01:10:40.062
I've got something new
Charly's going to love.

01:10:44.984 --> 01:10:46.986
Come on, Charly. Come on.

01:10:47.526 --> 01:10:49.362
It's me. I should go.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.322
No, it's not you. It's-

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:53.908
Where have you been?

01:10:53.908 --> 01:10:55.534
I was worried.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:58.747
Hey! I'm talking to you.

01:10:58.747 --> 01:11:01.415
it's just like
all the other towns.

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:04.628
Anouk.

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:05.879
Anouk.

01:11:06.838 --> 01:11:07.839
Just tell me what happened.

01:11:07.839 --> 01:11:09.758
Are you Satan's helper?

01:11:12.344 --> 01:11:15.138
Well, it's not
easy being different.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.850
Why can't we go to church?

01:11:20.183 --> 01:11:23.562
Well, you can if you want,
but it won't make things easier.

01:11:24.772 --> 01:11:27.525
Why can't you wear black shoes
like the other mothers?

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:35.741
He's a fine piece of work,
our little nobleman.

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:39.495
No wonder his wife
goes gallivanting off.

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:42.415
She's been in ltaly for months.
Did you know that?

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.791
Armande...

01:11:44.292 --> 01:11:46.210
the whole town's against me.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.338
What can I do?

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.548
Throw me a party.

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:54.551
Ha ha ha ! What?

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.429
Wednesday's my 70th.

01:11:56.929 --> 01:12:00.182
Let's show the bastards
we're ready to go down dancing.

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:06.814
But a party?

01:12:09.357 --> 01:12:11.318
You're not well.
You have to face it.

01:12:11.318 --> 01:12:12.861
OK, OK, OK...

01:12:14.655 --> 01:12:17.282
But you do this for me,
and I promise...

01:12:17.783 --> 01:12:19.702
I'll check into Le Mortoir
the very next morning...

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.870
without a care in the world.

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:30.127
If I threw a party in this town,
no one would come.

01:12:32.004 --> 01:12:34.757
They don't need to know
who's throwing it.

01:12:35.925 --> 01:12:37.760
Armande, listen, I-

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:39.846
No, no, no.
You listen.

01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:43.391
I need this.

01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:51.858
When I need help, I ask for it.

01:13:12.461 --> 01:13:15.006
Boys,
bring me some more wood.

01:13:26.057 --> 01:13:28.018
My mother
used to sing that song...

01:13:28.018 --> 01:13:29.936
when I couldn't sleep.

01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:32.313
And did it help?

01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:37.736
I still didn't sleep,
but, yes, it helped.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.867
How's the door?

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.661
It squeaks.

01:13:46.119 --> 01:13:47.913
-Does it?
-Ha ha !

01:13:47.954 --> 01:13:49.915
How's Anouk? Is she well?

01:13:50.541 --> 01:13:52.459
Oh, she's better. She's fine.

01:13:52.459 --> 01:13:54.461
Good. How are you?

01:13:55.836 --> 01:13:57.797
I'm throwing a party...

01:13:59.549 --> 01:14:00.550
If anyone shows up.

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:01.842
Thanks.

01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:05.138
Who's invited?

01:14:05.471 --> 01:14:07.432
A bunch of townspeople.

01:14:09.267 --> 01:14:11.227
Tell me something.
Why do you give a damn about...

01:14:11.227 --> 01:14:13.897
what these narrow-minded
villagers think?

01:14:14.647 --> 01:14:17.108
You're not scared of them,
are you?

01:14:18.026 --> 01:14:20.111
Coming to the party or not?

01:14:22.405 --> 01:14:23.782
I can't.

01:14:24.449 --> 01:14:27.285
There's a boycott
against immorality...

01:14:27.367 --> 01:14:29.286
and I must respect that.

01:14:29.286 --> 01:14:30.287
That is a problem.

01:14:30.996 --> 01:14:34.249
Then, I'll leave you with
this test of your convictions.

01:14:34.959 --> 01:14:36.502
What is that?

01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:38.504
Your favorite.

01:14:37.962 --> 01:14:40.089
My favorite?
Is that right?

01:14:41.424 --> 01:14:43.634
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:14:52.059 --> 01:14:53.603
I'm undone-

01:14:54.103 --> 01:14:55.938
but not my favorite.

01:14:57.232 --> 01:14:58.441
Hmm.

01:15:03.069 --> 01:15:04.028
I'll come round sometime...

01:15:04.028 --> 01:15:06.406
get that squeak
out of your door.

01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:27.445
A lot for you.

01:16:28.779 --> 01:16:29.738
You see? It's perfect.

01:16:42.584 --> 01:16:43.585
Bon appetit, everyone.

01:16:44.544 --> 01:16:46.004
Oh!

01:16:55.222 --> 01:16:56.431
Ahh.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.646
If the comte finds out...

01:17:02.395 --> 01:17:05.398
The comte isn't here.
He wasn't invited.

01:17:06.608 --> 01:17:08.443
Is Luc coming?

01:17:11.153 --> 01:17:13.406
I'm sure they have other plans.

01:17:14.866 --> 01:17:16.075
Luc?

01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:19.329
Why are you sleeping?

01:17:19.912 --> 01:17:21.122
Hmm?

01:17:27.712 --> 01:17:29.714
Are you not feeling well?

01:17:47.648 --> 01:17:49.691
Happy birthday, Grandmama.

01:17:52.904 --> 01:17:55.322
The invitation said 5:00.

01:17:55.614 --> 01:17:58.284
I should have read it
more closely.

01:17:58.826 --> 01:18:02.121
If you had, you'd know there
was supposed to be no gifts.

01:18:03.998 --> 01:18:06.876
Don't worry so much
about the "supposed to."

01:18:09.628 --> 01:18:11.171
Like it?

01:18:20.346 --> 01:18:22.140
You made me younger.

01:18:23.224 --> 01:18:24.935
Very diplomatic.

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:37.323
Mmm.

01:19:17.612 --> 01:19:19.572
I have two announcements.

01:19:19.572 --> 01:19:21.073
Shh!

01:19:21.281 --> 01:19:23.242
Number one-if you like
what you tasted here...

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:27.287
you're going to love
my chocolate festival on Sunday.

01:19:27.622 --> 01:19:29.582
Advertise on your own time.

01:19:29.582 --> 01:19:31.376
What's for dessert?

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:33.836
That brings me to number two.

01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:36.589
It is my duty to announce...

01:19:37.798 --> 01:19:40.343
that there is no dessert
here tonight.

01:19:40.718 --> 01:19:41.677
Oh !

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.428
No dessert?

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:44.804
Because it's on Roux's boat.

01:19:47.974 --> 01:19:49.934
Any complaints, see me.

01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:11.932
Monsieur le Comte?

01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:12.891
Who's there?

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:16.187
I must speak to you.

01:21:32.369 --> 01:21:34.830
You see, Monsieur le Comte?
You see?

01:21:35.664 --> 01:21:38.125
There's Josephine,
that stupid cow.

01:21:41.503 --> 01:21:43.714
Something must be done, Serge.

01:21:45.549 --> 01:21:47.510
Something must be done.

01:22:17.205 --> 01:22:19.166
-You done yet?
-Almost.

01:22:20.374 --> 01:22:22.001
-Almost?
-Hmm?

01:22:24.586 --> 01:22:25.587
Come on, leave it.
You're done.

01:22:25.587 --> 01:22:27.131
Come with me.

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:29.841
Come on.

01:22:34.138 --> 01:22:36.307
I have chocolates everywhere.

01:22:36.557 --> 01:22:38.475
What? You're all right.

01:22:44.315 --> 01:22:46.275
Do you think everyone
had a good time?

01:23:55.342 --> 01:23:56.761
I'm tired.

01:23:57.386 --> 01:23:58.929
Vianne, Roux.

01:24:01.515 --> 01:24:02.850
Thanks.

01:24:03.475 --> 01:24:04.935
This was...

01:24:07.312 --> 01:24:08.731
Thank you.

01:24:14.111 --> 01:24:15.070
I'll take you home.

01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:17.364
Oh, for God's sake,
don't fuss.

01:24:17.865 --> 01:24:20.535
You'll ruin
a perfectly decadent evening.

01:24:21.201 --> 01:24:23.120
I'm not partial
to big, sloppy good-byes.

01:24:25.079 --> 01:24:26.456
Armande.

01:24:35.674 --> 01:24:37.634
I'll take care
of the dishes.

01:24:38.218 --> 01:24:41.180
I think I'll sleep
in my chair tonight.

01:25:21.511 --> 01:25:23.472
Do you like it?

01:25:23.722 --> 01:25:26.433
Taking your home with you
wherever you go?

01:25:27.433 --> 01:25:29.017
Yeah. Why not?

01:25:30.268 --> 01:25:32.187
Your way must be harder-

01:25:32.771 --> 01:25:35.774
each time having to make
a new home from scratch.

01:25:37.276 --> 01:25:39.903
Well, maybe this time
I'll get it right.

01:25:40.738 --> 01:25:41.697
What do you mean?

01:25:41.697 --> 01:25:43.366
Maybe I'll stay.

01:25:45.909 --> 01:25:47.453
What?

01:25:53.876 --> 01:25:56.795
Don't you ever think
about belonging somewhere?

01:26:00.423 --> 01:26:02.300
The price is too high.

01:26:03.051 --> 01:26:04.970
You end up caring what
people expect of you.

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:06.138
No.

01:26:07.014 --> 01:26:08.849
Is that so terrible?

01:26:09.933 --> 01:26:12.477
Having people
expect something of you?

01:26:16.732 --> 01:26:18.901
How does Anouk feel about it?

01:26:20.568 --> 01:26:21.820
What?

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:24.489
All the moving around.

01:26:25.908 --> 01:26:27.534
No, she's fine.

01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:29.787
She handles it beautifully.

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:32.872
She makes friends easily.

01:26:34.248 --> 01:26:36.292
She has such an unusual...

01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:44.133
She hates it.

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.068
Vianne.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.155
Vianne, come on.

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:32.949
Come on.

01:28:54.887 --> 01:28:56.847
We need more! Hurry up!

01:28:56.847 --> 01:28:58.140
Anouk!

01:29:02.978 --> 01:29:04.564
Mommy!

01:29:11.736 --> 01:29:12.696
Aah!

01:29:12.696 --> 01:29:13.697
Anouk!

01:29:27.419 --> 01:29:28.587
No!

01:29:30.339 --> 01:29:31.631
Jesus!

01:29:37.137 --> 01:29:38.805
Come back!

01:29:40.848 --> 01:29:42.433
Anouk!

01:29:42.808 --> 01:29:44.727
Come back, Vianne!

01:29:48.606 --> 01:29:50.233
Anouk!

01:29:51.275 --> 01:29:52.777
-Stop!
-No!

01:29:53.111 --> 01:29:54.112
-No!
-Stop it!

01:29:55.404 --> 01:29:57.115
Stop it! Stop it!

01:29:59.325 --> 01:30:00.284
-Come back!
-No!

01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:17.300
No!

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.678
Come on !

01:30:48.331 --> 01:30:50.167
Why did you stop me?

01:30:50.292 --> 01:30:51.960
It was too late.

01:30:55.422 --> 01:30:57.299
Mom!

01:31:01.261 --> 01:31:02.846
There she is.

01:31:04.181 --> 01:31:05.140
Oh, my God, there she is!

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.433
Mama !

01:31:07.475 --> 01:31:09.394
Anouska ! I'm coming !

01:31:09.436 --> 01:31:10.896
Oh, my God.

01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:19.654
You're hurting me.

01:32:28.972 --> 01:32:31.600
I just wanted
to make sure that...

01:32:32.183 --> 01:32:33.769
Yes, we're OK.

01:32:35.729 --> 01:32:36.897
You?

01:32:40.859 --> 01:32:42.694
And I came to say...

01:32:44.446 --> 01:32:46.657
To say good-bye.
Yes, I know.

01:32:53.996 --> 01:32:55.248
What?

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.458
Your boat.

01:32:59.627 --> 01:33:01.504
You've lost your home.

01:33:03.173 --> 01:33:04.340
No.

01:33:05.383 --> 01:33:08.261
Just a way to get
from place to place, really.

01:33:11.514 --> 01:33:13.308
So, how will you...

01:33:13.474 --> 01:33:14.976
I'll manage.

01:33:26.278 --> 01:33:27.612
Well...

01:33:33.577 --> 01:33:35.204
Well...

01:33:37.957 --> 01:33:39.374
Vianne...

01:33:41.836 --> 01:33:43.378
Listen, I...

01:33:43.671 --> 01:33:45.715
I know. I'm sorry.

01:33:48.175 --> 01:33:49.594
I'm sorry.

01:34:03.523 --> 01:34:06.735
Your papa used to ride this bike
every single morning.

01:34:09.154 --> 01:34:10.114
He would have wanted you
to have it.

01:34:12.031 --> 01:34:15.160
Just you promise me
you'll never run away again, OK?

01:34:14.909 --> 01:34:16.620
Mama, she...

01:34:17.829 --> 01:34:19.498
What?

01:34:20.749 --> 01:34:22.501
What's wrong, Luc?

01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:28.422
Though we cannot know...

01:34:28.422 --> 01:34:30.799
Armande Voizin's
last thoughts...

01:34:31.843 --> 01:34:34.595
we can hope they were
thoughts of penitence.

01:34:37.098 --> 01:34:39.058
We can hope she asked God...

01:34:39.058 --> 01:34:41.394
to forgive
the self indulgence...

01:34:41.269 --> 01:34:44.188
that aggravated her illness
and caused her death...

01:34:45.690 --> 01:34:48.484
and we can pause
to reexamine our own lives.

01:34:50.028 --> 01:34:51.946
We can resist those...

01:34:51.988 --> 01:34:54.365
who would lead us
into temptation.

01:35:06.335 --> 01:35:08.295
Blessed is the one
who endures temptation...

01:35:08.295 --> 01:35:10.673
for when he has stood
the test...

01:35:32.277 --> 01:35:33.861
Mama...

01:35:34.988 --> 01:35:37.490
Can we go home now?

01:35:59.637 --> 01:36:01.055
Of course.

01:36:01.806 --> 01:36:03.224
Of course.

01:36:07.186 --> 01:36:09.188
Whatever you like, Mama.

01:36:10.815 --> 01:36:11.816
Vianne, did you want me...

01:36:11.816 --> 01:36:14.360
to start the ganache
for the festival?

01:36:14.736 --> 01:36:16.028
Vianne?

01:36:16.654 --> 01:36:18.072
Did you-

01:36:20.617 --> 01:36:22.410
What are you doing?

01:36:22.994 --> 01:36:25.788
Leaving.
First thing in the morning.

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.553
Is it because of Armande?

01:36:41.553 --> 01:36:43.514
That was not your fault.

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:46.642
It's time, that's all.

01:36:47.684 --> 01:36:49.395
This is who I am.

01:36:58.237 --> 01:37:00.740
Did you believe
anything you told me?

01:37:02.198 --> 01:37:05.035
Did you believe
I could be better?

01:37:05.994 --> 01:37:07.746
Was it all a joke?

01:37:17.463 --> 01:37:19.215
I have to pack now.

01:37:23.386 --> 01:37:25.346
If you leave,
everything will go back...

01:37:25.346 --> 01:37:27.265
to the way it always was.

01:37:27.391 --> 01:37:29.560
It is the way it always was.

01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:33.729
Not for me.

01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:41.571
I know how you feel.

01:37:42.071 --> 01:37:44.073
Beg your pardon?

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.368
I suppose it can't be easy...

01:37:49.079 --> 01:37:50.746
having her gone.

01:37:54.125 --> 01:37:57.337
Can't seem to get used to it,
no matter how much time.

01:38:01.925 --> 01:38:05.929
Ahem. But I...
look forward to her return.

01:38:09.014 --> 01:38:13.018
I don't believe anyone
would think less of you...

01:38:15.813 --> 01:38:19.024
if you were to say
she was never coming back.

01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:24.154
Good night, Paul.

01:38:37.584 --> 01:38:38.960
Caroline!

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:41.838
I'm sorry.

01:38:44.215 --> 01:38:46.092
I need to talk to you.

01:38:54.268 --> 01:38:55.602
Come in.

01:38:56.645 --> 01:38:58.397
Monsieur le Comte.

01:38:59.398 --> 01:39:01.024
It's all right.

01:39:02.484 --> 01:39:05.112
Sorry to bother you,
Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:05.404 --> 01:39:07.197
All right.

01:39:10.866 --> 01:39:13.494
It was the right thing to do,
wasn't it?

01:39:14.495 --> 01:39:17.040
Of course it was.
I know it was.

01:39:17.581 --> 01:39:19.834
it's everything with Josephine.

01:39:21.002 --> 01:39:22.711
Serge...

01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:23.922
What are you talking about?

01:39:24.005 --> 01:39:24.964
The fire,
Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:24.964 --> 01:39:26.883
I know it was
the right thing to do...

01:39:28.592 --> 01:39:31.595
but I can't get rid of
the faces and the screams.

01:39:33.014 --> 01:39:34.515
The fire...

01:39:36.142 --> 01:39:38.227
The fire was an act of God.

01:39:39.812 --> 01:39:42.022
It was me, Monsieur le Comte.

01:39:44.942 --> 01:39:46.485
What?

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.779
You told me. Remember?

01:39:51.407 --> 01:39:54.201
"Something
has to be done, Serge. "

01:39:56.036 --> 01:39:57.871
You did, didn't you?

01:40:07.465 --> 01:40:09.383
People could have died.

01:40:10.342 --> 01:40:13.178
You want
their blood on your hands?

01:40:13.886 --> 01:40:15.555
On-on my hands?

01:40:17.015 --> 01:40:20.018
Should I go to Pere Henri
and ask for forgiveness?

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.855
Listen to me, Serge.

01:40:25.148 --> 01:40:27.067
Listen very carefully.

01:40:28.526 --> 01:40:31.446
You must leave
this village at once...

01:40:32.906 --> 01:40:34.616
and never return.

01:40:35.492 --> 01:40:38.036
Why would I leave
my home and my cafe?

01:40:38.203 --> 01:40:40.706
Because I'm evicting you,
that's why!

01:40:41.789 --> 01:40:43.750
What you have done
puts you beyond anyone's help...

01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:45.668
beyond my help, anybody's help!

01:40:46.335 --> 01:40:47.879
Now get out!

01:40:48.295 --> 01:40:50.214
Unless you will tell the police
what you've done!

01:40:50.339 --> 01:40:53.551
Get out! Get out! Get out!

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.654
Time to go.

01:41:13.654 --> 01:41:14.863
Hmm?

01:41:15.447 --> 01:41:16.407
Oh, no.

01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.991
I'm not going.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.119
Well, it's hard for me, too.

01:41:20.286 --> 01:41:21.245
Pantoufle hates this.

01:41:21.245 --> 01:41:22.788
Stop that.

01:41:22.996 --> 01:41:23.955
Please put it on.

01:41:23.872 --> 01:41:25.374
I hate you.

01:41:26.958 --> 01:41:29.378
You're entitled.
I said put it on.

01:41:34.383 --> 01:41:35.384
Well, then, do it yourself!

01:41:35.384 --> 01:41:36.718
I can't!

01:41:37.428 --> 01:41:38.762
Get up.

01:41:38.971 --> 01:41:40.890
I have a bad leg like Pantoufle.

01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:41.891
Stop that. Get up.

01:41:42.308 --> 01:41:45.019
Pantoufle can't walk.
I can't walk.

01:41:45.435 --> 01:41:46.394
Walk. Walk!

01:41:46.394 --> 01:41:47.353
You're hurting me.

01:41:47.437 --> 01:41:49.230
Well, stop being...

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.738
Let me go!

01:41:58.073 --> 01:41:59.240
No!

01:42:00.366 --> 01:42:01.952
It's not fair!

01:42:02.327 --> 01:42:03.662
Stop it!

01:42:04.454 --> 01:42:05.455
I'm not going !

01:42:05.455 --> 01:42:07.040
It's-Stop it!

01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:27.810
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:42:28.102 --> 01:42:29.812
I'm sorry.

01:42:33.941 --> 01:42:35.985
Don't worry, Mama.

01:42:46.495 --> 01:42:49.331
The next time will be better,
won't it, Mama?

01:42:53.002 --> 01:42:54.378
It will.

01:42:54.962 --> 01:42:57.131
it will be wonderful.

01:42:59.008 --> 01:43:01.010
I'm ready to go now, OK?

01:43:36.127 --> 01:43:37.128
Like this, Mama?

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.047
That's right.

01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:42.967
Is this right?

01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:45.887
No, no, you've got to cut
on the corners like this.

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:47.639
So, just stop them.

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.435
Higher.

01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:10.078
How do you like these almonds?

01:44:13.539 --> 01:44:16.167
Are they chopped fine enough?

01:44:22.464 --> 01:44:24.800
Are they OK, Vianne?

01:44:39.147 --> 01:44:41.066
Christ is risen.

01:44:41.024 --> 01:44:44.362
My friends, let this Easter Day
be for us, too, a rebirth.

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:45.779
Let us strive-

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:47.698
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.075
No, don't bury
the word "rebirth."

01:44:50.075 --> 01:44:51.744
Let it ring out.

01:44:52.077 --> 01:44:54.747
Let this day be
for us, too, a rebirth !

01:44:54.912 --> 01:44:56.873
You see, we are extolling
our-our parishioners...

01:44:56.873 --> 01:44:59.459
to-to resurrect
their moral awareness.

01:45:00.502 --> 01:45:02.420
Hmm? OK, good, good.
T-try again.

01:45:02.712 --> 01:45:03.713
I think we've
gone over this enough.

01:45:03.755 --> 01:45:04.756
Let's call it a day.

01:45:04.756 --> 01:45:05.715
What?

01:45:06.049 --> 01:45:07.009
I'm very tired.

01:45:07.092 --> 01:45:08.051
Fine, fine.
Well, leave it with me.

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:09.261
I may have one
or two suggestions.

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:10.220
Thank you, Monsieur le Comte-

01:45:10.428 --> 01:45:11.596
Just a couple of suggestions.

01:45:11.763 --> 01:45:12.764
A revision here and there.

01:45:12.931 --> 01:45:15.725
We want it to be perfect
tomorrow, don't we?

01:45:17.394 --> 01:45:18.896
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:27.361
We must resist the shallow,
worldly temptations...

01:45:27.403 --> 01:45:29.280
of our mortal-No, no.

01:45:29.321 --> 01:45:32.241
We must renounce shallow,
worldly temptations...

01:45:32.241 --> 01:45:33.200
of our mortal flesh.

01:45:42.043 --> 01:45:43.419
Caroline.

01:45:48.925 --> 01:45:51.428
All my efforts
have been for nothing.

01:45:52.554 --> 01:45:54.514
I've suffered willingly.

01:45:55.306 --> 01:45:56.848
I've fasted.

01:45:57.266 --> 01:45:59.226
I've hardly eaten for weeks now.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.977
I'm sorry.

01:46:02.271 --> 01:46:04.190
I'm sorry,
my suffering is nothing.

01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:06.650
It's just that I...
I feel so lost.

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.362
I don't know what to do.

01:46:12.531 --> 01:46:14.325
Tell me what to do.

01:49:43.196 --> 01:49:44.989
Drink this.

01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:52.872
Drink this.

01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:55.292
lt'll refresh you.

01:49:55.375 --> 01:49:56.334
I promise.

01:49:57.002 --> 01:49:58.670
Go ahead, drink.

01:50:11.098 --> 01:50:12.684
I'm so sorry.

01:50:14.143 --> 01:50:15.978
I won't tell a soul.

01:50:20.399 --> 01:50:22.777
Hmm.
Better get cleaned up.

01:50:22.985 --> 01:50:24.571
Easter Sunday.

01:50:26.322 --> 01:50:27.782
The sermon.

01:50:32.454 --> 01:50:34.205
I didn't finish it.

01:50:35.707 --> 01:50:38.209
I'lI think of something.

01:50:50.053 --> 01:50:53.432
I'm not sure what the theme
of my homily today ought to be.

01:50:58.145 --> 01:51:00.814
Do I want to speak
of the miracle...

01:51:01.065 --> 01:51:03.525
of our Lord's
divine transformation?

01:51:04.443 --> 01:51:06.070
Not really, no.

01:51:07.238 --> 01:51:10.116
I don't want
to talk about His divinity.

01:51:13.076 --> 01:51:15.536
I'd rather talk about
His humanity.

01:51:16.997 --> 01:51:20.166
I mean, you know, how he
lived his life here on Earth.

01:51:21.667 --> 01:51:23.211
His kindness.

01:51:23.628 --> 01:51:25.213
His tolerance.

01:51:26.547 --> 01:51:28.466
Listen, here's what I think.

01:51:29.425 --> 01:51:31.595
I think we can't go around...

01:51:32.345 --> 01:51:35.098
measuring our goodness
by what we don't do.

01:51:35.849 --> 01:51:38.268
By what we
deny ourselves...

01:51:38.476 --> 01:51:39.435
what we resist...

01:51:39.435 --> 01:51:41.229
and who we exclude.

01:51:44.148 --> 01:51:46.776
I think we've got
to measure goodness...

01:51:47.067 --> 01:51:48.903
by what we embrace...

01:51:49.695 --> 01:51:51.406
what we create...

01:51:52.948 --> 01:51:54.742
and who we include.

01:52:00.998 --> 01:52:02.917
it was certainly not...

01:52:02.917 --> 01:52:06.045
the most fiery sermon
Pere Henri would ever preach...

01:52:07.797 --> 01:52:09.715
nor the most eloquent.

01:52:11.967 --> 01:52:15.055
But the parishioners
felt a new sensation that day.

01:52:17.056 --> 01:52:19.099
A lightening of the spirit.

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:24.729
A freedom
from the old tranquilite.

01:52:52.757 --> 01:52:54.468
Whoa ! Fantastic!

01:52:57.596 --> 01:53:00.098
Monsieur le Comte,
try one of these.

01:53:00.515 --> 01:53:01.475
Thank you.

01:53:02.058 --> 01:53:04.018
Even the Comte de Reynaud...

01:53:04.018 --> 01:53:05.729
felt strangely...

01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:08.106
released.

01:53:13.445 --> 01:53:15.364
Although, it would take
another six months...

01:53:16.739 --> 01:53:20.159
before he'd work up the nerve
to ask Caroline out to dinner.

01:53:39.095 --> 01:53:40.847
As for Josephine...

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:44.600
she took over the lease
at the old cafe...

01:53:45.935 --> 01:53:47.854
and gave it a new name.

01:54:03.827 --> 01:54:05.788
But still
the clever North Wind...

01:54:05.788 --> 01:54:07.498
was not satisfied.

01:54:20.718 --> 01:54:22.679
The Wind spoke to Vianne...

01:54:22.679 --> 01:54:24.722
of towns yet to be visited.

01:54:27.184 --> 01:54:29.769
Friends in need,
yet to be discovered.

01:54:33.106 --> 01:54:35.108
Battles yet to be fought.

01:54:42.365 --> 01:54:44.492
By someone else...next time.

01:54:58.881 --> 01:55:01.633
And so it was,
the North Wind grew weary...

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.595
and went on its way.

01:55:05.763 --> 01:55:07.724
When summer came
to the little village...

01:55:08.432 --> 01:55:11.310
a new breeze from the south
blew soft and warm.

01:55:17.650 --> 01:55:19.569
Just needed an adjustment.

01:55:19.569 --> 01:55:21.613
Hope it'll be better now.

01:55:22.488 --> 01:55:23.989
Roux!

01:55:24.072 --> 01:55:25.366
My mother
knew Roux's return...

01:55:25.616 --> 01:55:28.243
had nothing to do
with a silly old door.

01:55:32.248 --> 01:55:33.624
So did I.

01:55:36.377 --> 01:55:38.337
I thought you'd never guess.

01:55:38.337 --> 01:55:40.422
My favorite, hot chocolate.

01:55:43.675 --> 01:55:45.219
I knew that.

01:55:54.185 --> 01:55:56.437
As for Pantoufle?

01:55:58.314 --> 01:56:00.942
Well, his bad leg
miraculously healed...

01:56:03.153 --> 01:56:05.989
and he hopped off
in search of new adventures.

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.952
I didn't miss him.
