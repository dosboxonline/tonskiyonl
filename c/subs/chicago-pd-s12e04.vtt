WEBVTT

00:05.238 --> 00:05.405
.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.373
- And many fans
are still reeling from that

00:07.073 --> 00:09.109
historically terrible season.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.677
It's just a dismal time
to be a fan

00:10.710 --> 00:13.747
of the Chicago White Sox,
but the good news is

00:13.780 --> 00:17.450
there's no place to go but up.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.486
Assuming that ownership
can acknowledge the severity

00:19.519 --> 00:21.221
of the problem,
because this offseason,

00:21.254 --> 00:23.623
they need to be making
drastic changes.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.559
And, yes, a rebuilding year
will be painful

00:26.593 --> 00:28.728
for the organization,
no doubt, but worth it.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.664
- [grunting]

00:35.869 --> 00:36.836
[equipment clattering]

00:36.870 --> 00:40.206
[panting]

00:41.541 --> 00:44.477
[breathes deeply]

00:54.688 --> 00:56.690
[water dripping]

00:56.723 --> 00:58.591
No.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.793
[water dripping]

00:59.826 --> 01:03.730
Damn it.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.231
[grunts]

01:12.672 --> 01:15.575
[grunts]

01:15.608 --> 01:16.609
[car horn honks]

01:16.643 --> 01:19.179
[sighs]

01:24.250 --> 01:26.486
Oh, hey.
- Hey, I was just calling you.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.589
- Yeah, I know I'm late.
Where are you going?

01:29.622 --> 01:31.358
- Well, Defense asked
for a continuance.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.760
We're not up.
- Oh.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.362
- You all right?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.197
- There's a leak
in my basement.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.932
- Oh, OK.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.533
Well, we're gonna
be pushed months,

01:40.567 --> 01:42.502
but we should review once
while it's still fresh.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.704
Can you do breakfast?
- Yeah, sure.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.339
I'll drive.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.479
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:53.480 --> 01:57.717
- So a leaky pipe?
That's all?

01:57.751 --> 01:59.519
By the way, if you need
approval for a warrant

01:59.552 --> 02:00.854
anytime soon,
you're gonna have

02:00.887 --> 02:02.689
to bug someone else.
- Hmm?

02:02.722 --> 02:05.625
- I got pulled into a federal
RICO case out of Denver.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.361
Starts next week.
- That cartel thing?

02:08.395 --> 02:11.197
- Kid got pulled over
with expired registration.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.933
Got caught with six keys
of dope in his car.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.902
He's only 18,
but he looks affiliated.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.671
It's gonna be a long one.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.407
- 5021, squad,
repeat that description.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.275
- Female, white,
balaclava duct-taped

02:22.308 --> 02:23.410
around her neck,
arms bound.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.512
[engine revs,
tires squealing]

02:25.545 --> 02:29.449
- 5021, hold me down
responding.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.951
- [sighs]

02:31.985 --> 02:34.220
[siren wailing]

02:34.254 --> 02:37.223
[tense music]

02:37.257 --> 02:39.292
* *

02:39.325 --> 02:41.494
- Hey.
Voight, Intelligence.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.329
Where's the victim?
- Inside.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.432
She keeps panicking every time
we try to approach.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.267
- Well...
- She's gonna hurt herself.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.704
I've got an ambo coming.
- Good, good.

02:50.737 --> 02:55.241
* *

02:55.275 --> 02:56.509
- Hey.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.744
She won't let me get closer.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.446
I--I don't know what to do.
- OK.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.580
Through here?
- Yeah, through there.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.850
- Just wait outside.
- All right.

03:03.883 --> 03:10.757
* *

03:12.625 --> 03:14.461
- [sobbing]

03:14.494 --> 03:15.995
- Miss?
I'm police.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.464
- No, no, no, no.
- It's OK.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.466
- No, get away from me.
- OK.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.934
- No.
- I'm not coming any closer.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.769
- No, no.

03:22.802 --> 03:25.405
[sobbing]

03:25.438 --> 03:27.040
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.810
I'm just here to help.
- [sobbing]

03:30.844 --> 03:32.012
- Now, take it easy.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.848
- Miss, I'm Nina.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.616
I know this police officer.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.987
OK, I trust the police here.
They are not gonna hurt you.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.390
We're just here to help.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.625
Is that OK?
Can we help you?

03:45.658 --> 03:47.827
- [sobbing]

03:47.861 --> 03:48.628
- OK, I'm gonna come closer,

03:48.661 --> 03:50.697
but only if
you're OK with that.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.334
- [sobbing]

03:54.367 --> 03:57.704
- OK. OK.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.607
OK. I got you.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.742
You're safe. OK.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.512
Now, I can take your mask off,
but, um,

04:05.545 --> 04:07.547
gonna have to touch you.
Is that OK?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.949
- [sobs]
- Can you say OK?

04:09.983 --> 04:13.286
Because I won't touch you
unless you say it's OK.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.924
- OK.
- OK.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.894
- [crying softly]

04:22.562 --> 04:24.330
- All right, I'm gonna
get this mask off now.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.067
I'm just gonna touch your neck
so I can take the tape off.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.536
It's OK.
Just me.

04:29.569 --> 04:33.340
You're safe.
- [gasping]

04:33.373 --> 04:37.877
[coughing]
- OK. OK. OK.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.846
I'm peeling off the tape.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.615
Yeah.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.618
Yeah, OK.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.721
OK.

04:47.754 --> 04:54.694
* *

05:11.878 --> 05:12.379
.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.179
- No, no, no,
please don't touch me.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.749
Please stop, I don't want
to be touched anymore.

05:15.782 --> 05:16.850
- I know, but we
have to examine you.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.651
- Jamie, I'm just gonna
ask you one more question.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.086
Do you know the man
who hurt you?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.722
- No, I said I don't know.
- OK.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.424
- Please tell them
to stop touching me.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.459
- OK, I know.
They know.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.095
- Ah! Ugh!
- Are you hurt there?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.930
Draw 2 milligrams lorazepam.
- Drawing 2 of lorazepam.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.599
- No, no, no! Please! Please!

05:32.632 --> 05:37.437
I just wanna go home.
Please!

05:37.470 --> 05:40.874
[sobbing and groaning]

05:40.907 --> 05:43.977
- Anybody got ears in?

05:44.010 --> 05:48.648
- Why did you respond
to that radio call?

05:48.682 --> 05:53.620
- I worked a version of
this case before, 15 years ago.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.623
You need a lift back to court?

05:56.656 --> 06:00.093
- No, no, I'm gonna stay here
so she won't be alone.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.561
- Copy, Sarge, I'm here.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.430
- Listen, I need everything
you can get me

06:03.463 --> 06:05.065
on a Jamie Mackinson.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.967
Mid-30s, female, white,
brown hair, brown eyes.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.803
I'm en route now.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.939
Trudy.

06:12.972 --> 06:15.709
- Hey, all the '09 case files
are getting pulled now.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.444
Do you think it's the same?
- I don't know yet.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.712
We gotta work it.
- All right.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.013
Hard copies will be here soon.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.014
- Thank you.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.916
[keypad beeping]

06:22.949 --> 06:25.151
[lock clicks]

06:25.185 --> 06:27.187
All right.
What do we got?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.555
- Patrol's doing a grid search,

06:28.588 --> 06:29.823
canvassing the area
you found Jamie.

06:29.856 --> 06:30.790
Nothing yet.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.660
- Victim is
Jamie Danielle Mackinson, 35.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.228
She's an aspiring artist
who works nights

06:35.261 --> 06:37.063
as a cocktail waitress,
lives alone,

06:37.097 --> 06:38.798
rents a house in Ravenswood.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.701
- No 911 calls, no reports
from any neighbors.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.870
No clue as to what
actually happened to her.

06:43.903 --> 06:44.971
- Huh.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.473
- She didn't give you
anything else?

06:46.506 --> 06:48.508
- No, just her name.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.144
She was beaten, likely raped.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.879
All right,
let's find some evidence.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.681
Hit Jamie's house,
pull PODs, cams.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.516
Talk to her friends,
neighbors, associates.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.018
- Hey.
Here.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.220
- Oh, thank you.
- There's more on the way.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.958
- Listen,
the way Jamie was bound,

07:04.991 --> 07:07.260
it's very similar to a spree
of unsolved rapes

07:07.293 --> 07:08.561
I worked 15 years ago.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.830
Never had a suspect.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.799
All right, we're not jumping
to any conclusions.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.234
We just go where
the evidence takes us.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.169
- Copy that.
- All right.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.671
I pulled
all of Jamie's socials.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.906
She's got a string of DMs
from a Mikey Gonzalez.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.975
He's 40 years old.
He's Jamie's ex.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.810
Looks like they broke up
about a week ago.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.979
He doesn't seem
too happy about it.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.781
"You're making a big mistake.
Trust me."

07:27.814 --> 07:29.215
"Stupid bitch, you're gonna get
what's coming."

07:29.249 --> 07:31.551
"Deadass, bad things happen
to people like you."

07:31.584 --> 07:33.086
The last two
were sent yesterday.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.187
- Mikey got a sheet?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.556
[keyboard clacking]
- Yeah.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.291
Prior arrest
for sexual assault.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.993
He works at the same bar
as Jamie.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.961
Just spoke to the manager.
He's there now.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.863
- OK, let's you and me hit it,
Torres.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.066
The rest of you,
work Jamie's house.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.969
Pull her cell records,
start building.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.604
[glass shattering]
- Stop! Get out of my bar!

07:51.638 --> 07:53.807
- Get off my ass!
You don't want this.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.042
- Ow!
- There's Mikey.

07:56.076 --> 07:56.810
- [grunting]

07:56.843 --> 07:58.745
- Wanna try that again?
- Oh!

07:58.778 --> 08:02.315
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop! Police.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.017
Stop! Stop fighting.
Stop.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.118
- Come on.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.619
- Back.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.021
- Get the hell off me.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.723
- Get him out of here!
- [laughs]

08:09.756 --> 08:11.624
Oh, you called the cops
on me, you fat clown?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.826
You kidding me, huh?
- Get him out of here.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.160
- That's not why we're here.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.895
- Yeah?
Why you here?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.298
- We're here because of Jamie.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
- What? Jamie?
[laughs]

08:20.333 --> 08:21.768
What are you talking about?

08:21.801 --> 08:23.303
- When's the last time
you saw Jamie?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.171
- [panting]
I--

08:25.205 --> 08:27.640
- When?
- Two nights ago.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.142
She was with her new man,
so I bounced.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.211
- Where?
Where were you?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.846
- Outside her place.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.982
Some guy in a van came through,
so I left.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.651
- Some guy in a van?
That's the best you got?

08:38.685 --> 08:39.652
- Yeah, that's the best
I got, bro.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.754
What do you got?

08:40.787 --> 08:42.956
- [grunts]
OK?

08:42.989 --> 08:46.793
- Oh, yeah.

08:46.826 --> 08:47.927
[handcuffs clicking]
- Shut up.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.262
- [chuckles]
- Stand up.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.197
- Whoa.
Oh.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.667
Oh.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.136
[grunting]
- Hey, hey.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.004
Stop fighting.
- Hank?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.106
- Stop.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.308
- See you up there.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.943
What's up?

09:03.977 --> 09:07.013
- Jamie Mackinson
just died at Med.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.048
- What?

09:08.081 --> 09:10.350
- Doctors believe
she's been bleeding internally

09:10.383 --> 09:11.951
for the last 24 hours.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.953
She was hemorrhaging blood
from trauma to her spleen,

09:13.987 --> 09:16.990
so she must have been beaten.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.359
Postmortem, doctors
were able to disclose

09:19.392 --> 09:21.828
that she had been raped,
and her body

09:21.861 --> 09:24.931
was drenched with a, um--
- Chemical hair remover?

09:24.964 --> 09:27.667
Bleach agents,
internal and external?

09:27.701 --> 09:30.136
- Yes, exactly.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.739
- It's the same.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.174
It's all the same.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.677
He's back.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.716
- I'm telling you everything.
Why would I hurt her?

09:42.749 --> 09:43.983
She's the love of my life.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.118
- Love of your life
who you called a bitch?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.386
Who you threatened?

09:46.419 --> 09:47.487
- Because she broke
my damn heart.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.956
- What about the other women?
- What other women?

09:49.989 --> 09:53.126
- Cathy Ward, Megan Cobb,
Alexis Fogerty, Suzanne Hall...

09:53.159 --> 09:54.427
- Who the hell are they?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.062
- Claire Ballard,
Sara Marie Larsen.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.098
- I don't know
those other women!

10:06.039 --> 10:07.974
[door slams]
- His alibi checks out.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.743
Mikey's cell records
put him with his cousins

10:09.776 --> 10:11.077
in Kenosha all weekend
on a bender.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.312
- What, for 48?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.714
- Yeah, we've got witnesses
and half a dozen bar cameras.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.182
- And the prior rapes?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.251
- Mikey was living in Tampa
15 years ago,

10:18.284 --> 10:19.753
moved back to Chicago in 2020.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.788
He doesn't look good for this.
- All right.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.123
We get anything
at Jamie's house?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.991
- No.
No signs of a struggle.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.826
Neighbors didn't see anything.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.795
Kim's got forensics doing
a full sweep of her place.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.264
- OK, what about the van
Mikey claims he saw?

10:31.297 --> 10:32.699
- I can't confirm it.

10:32.732 --> 10:33.933
There's no PODs
on Jamie's block.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.736
I can't confirm
the van he saw either.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.371
'Cause, you know,
"Large and wearing a hoodie"

10:38.405 --> 10:39.906
is not a great description.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.408
- The only thing
we can confirm, Sarge,

10:41.441 --> 10:44.144
is that Jamie left work
at 1:00 a.m. two days ago.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.913
She returned home.
Phone was completely shut off.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.949
Nobody's seen her
until you found her.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.184
- OK.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.454
Back in '09, there was
a string of six rapes,

10:54.487 --> 10:56.189
one every two months.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.192
Victims all had brown hair,
were in their 30s.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.828
They were abducted late
at night from their homes,

11:01.861 --> 11:04.064
held for 48 hours,

11:04.097 --> 11:07.200
and when they resurfaced,
they had a balaclava

11:07.233 --> 11:10.070
taped around their neck.
Their arms were bound.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.172
They were doused in bleach,
chemical agents.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.040
- Rendering rape kits
worthless.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.508
- Yeah, I never got
a shred of DNA.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.477
Victims never saw the offender.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.212
He used a voice modulator.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.014
After a year,
the rapes just stopped.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.449
- What was your theory?

11:22.482 --> 11:23.883
- The offender died,
skipped town,

11:23.917 --> 11:25.852
or was jailed
on another offense.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.821
- So he's active again,
or this is a copycat.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.389
- Yeah, but none
of this information

11:29.422 --> 11:30.957
was ever made public.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.425
- 15 years is a long break.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.495
- Look, I'm gonna press Mikey
for a better description

11:35.528 --> 11:37.364
of that man
and the van he saw.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.965
Rest of you, just grab a box.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.334
Let's look into the past
until a lead pops.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.183
.

11:57.217 --> 11:57.550
- Find anything?

11:58.885 --> 12:02.455
- Uh, no, not yet.

12:02.489 --> 12:06.493
- Mm.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.962
You remember
all your old cases?

12:11.264 --> 12:15.435
- The unsolved ones, yeah.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.537
- Well, I was thinking
I'd help you build this one

12:17.570 --> 12:21.107
from the ground up, work here.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.410
- Appreciate that.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.211
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.946
- Found something strange.
- OK.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.481
- About four years ago,
one of the original victims,

12:28.515 --> 12:31.418
Suzanne Hall, she called 911
and told the dispatcher

12:31.451 --> 12:34.020
that he sent another one.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.588
- He sent another one?
- Yeah.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.723
She got flustered, hung up.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.859
They sent a car, but officers
couldn't make contact.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.895
- Hmm.
- Job was coded out 19-Paul.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.029
Could be nothing, but--

12:43.063 --> 12:44.964
- No, that sounds strange.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.334
Yeah, I'll check it out.
Thanks.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.835
Huh.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.037
- You want help?

12:51.071 --> 12:53.907
I helped with Jamie.
It might be worth your while.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.344
- Yeah, sure.
Come on.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.378
[doorbell rings]

12:58.411 --> 13:02.415
[dogs barking]

13:02.449 --> 13:04.551
- Who is it?

13:04.584 --> 13:07.487
- Chicago Police.
It's Sergeant Voight.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.824
[lock clicks]

13:14.227 --> 13:17.030
- Voight.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.099
Please.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.500
- Thanks.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.570
- You look different,
better.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.873
Looks like you found
a way through all that--

13:26.906 --> 13:29.175
I don't know what
we're supposed to call it--

13:29.209 --> 13:32.078
pain?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.913
- Hmm.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.916
- At least better
than me anyhow.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.918
[dog panting]

13:38.952 --> 13:40.487
He's my second.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.088
Still new on the job.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.025
- Well, he seems good at it.
- Mm.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.495
- Suzanne, we're here
to follow up on a call

13:48.528 --> 13:50.563
you placed a few years ago.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.366
Do you remember calling 911?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.207
- Oh, that, yeah.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.642
That was nothing.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.312
Just paranoia,
one of those things.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.148
A mistake is all.

14:08.181 --> 14:12.252
- Well, you said,
"He sent another one."

14:12.285 --> 14:14.387
Hmm?

14:14.421 --> 14:17.590
- Did I?
- Mm-hmm.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.626
- I don't know what that means.

14:24.964 --> 14:25.965
You know, I'm--I'm sorry.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.068
I'm really not interested
in dredging up the past,

14:28.101 --> 14:29.135
if that's why you came.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.305
- Another woman was taken.

14:32.339 --> 14:36.509
She was held, abused,
same as before.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.180
Only this time, she died.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.016
- If you know anything
that could help.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.619
- [whimpers]
No.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.021
- Suzanne, what did you mean

14:48.054 --> 14:50.957
when you said,
"He sent another one"?

14:50.990 --> 14:54.961
[somber music]

14:54.994 --> 14:57.330
- I was the last victim.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.065
He--he--stopped.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.002
I--I didn't think
it would help.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.503
- What would help?

15:03.536 --> 15:07.474
* *

15:07.507 --> 15:10.377
- Stay here.

15:10.410 --> 15:15.582
* *

15:15.615 --> 15:17.517
- [sighs]

15:17.550 --> 15:19.652
* *

15:19.686 --> 15:21.755
- [sighs]

15:21.788 --> 15:24.524
* *

15:24.557 --> 15:25.658
I'm sorry.

15:25.692 --> 15:30.030
I--I believed what he wrote,

15:30.063 --> 15:33.166
so--so I never said--

15:36.302 --> 15:38.638
- [sighs]

15:38.672 --> 15:45.211
* *

15:45.245 --> 15:47.547
[exhales]

15:47.580 --> 15:49.015
Yes, photos each year.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.684
So put a trap and trace
on Jamie's phone,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.218
get Tact on her house.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.087
Offender doesn't know
she's dead.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.290
Might send her a photo.

15:57.323 --> 16:00.460
Get a protection detail
at Suzanne Hall's.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.062
- On it, boss.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.431
- What did she mean, your pain?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.199
She said you found a way
through your pain?

16:06.232 --> 16:08.101
- Yeah, I know what she said.

16:08.134 --> 16:14.441
I, uh--this was the first case
I worked after my wife--

16:14.474 --> 16:19.312
my wife, Camille, died,
and I was, uh--

16:19.346 --> 16:21.147
I wasn't OK.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.051
Here.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.262
- You were right.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.697
Offender sent a photo to
Jamie's phone 20 minutes ago.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.200
Came from a prepaid burner,
which we're now tracking,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.668
along with a single word text--

16:41.701 --> 16:43.169
"Sufforing."

16:43.203 --> 16:44.404
- The word was misspelled
like that?

16:44.437 --> 16:45.238
- Yeah.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.239
- We're enhancing
the background now

16:46.272 --> 16:48.074
and running it through
any system we've got.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.176
CPIC's on it too.
- Previous victims?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.344
- Still tracking them down.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.479
I'll confirm
if they got Polaroids sent.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.481
- Hold up.
Wait, I got something.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.516
The burner that sent
Jamie's photo is actually on.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.651
It's moving west
through West Englewood.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.819
- Let's go.
Nina.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.621
- I'll be here.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.157
[suspenseful music]

17:04.190 --> 17:05.358
- All right, Kev,
offender just turned.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.862
He's heading north on Essex.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.398
The 3800 block of Essex.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.134
* *

17:14.167 --> 17:18.171
Just turned off Essex,
now heading west on Caro.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.472
Wait, wait.
I lost him.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.242
- What?
- Burner went dark.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.644
Got last seen on
the 8200 block of Caro.

17:24.678 --> 17:31.818
* *

17:44.431 --> 17:46.700
- All right.
We step light.

17:46.733 --> 17:53.840
* *

18:25.605 --> 18:27.707
Kev, Adam, I got blood
in the alley.

18:27.741 --> 18:30.844
Lock it down now!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.912
Chicago PD!
- I don't work here, man.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.714
- Chicago PD!
- He the only one.

18:34.748 --> 18:37.183
- Hey, I need to see
your security footage

18:37.217 --> 18:38.418
from the side entrance
right now.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.186
- It's right here.
- OK, let's go.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.321
- What's going on?

18:41.354 --> 18:42.255
- Just show me
the last 10 minutes.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.257
Come on.
Come on!

18:44.290 --> 18:48.561
There.
Rewind it.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.430
Keep--right there.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.865
Play it.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.868
[tense music]

18:54.901 --> 19:01.641
* *

19:22.395 --> 19:22.529
.

19:22.562 --> 19:22.996
- Get some tape up.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.999
Don't let anybody
step on my scene. Kev?

19:26.032 --> 19:27.634
- Yeah, the ID was confirmed
in the purse.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.904
The woman in the footage
is Ellie Miller, age 22.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.505
Her phone was in the purse.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.740
I got an investigative alert
going out right now

19:33.773 --> 19:35.241
to track down that van.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.010
- All right,
get a rush on all of it.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.479
Blood, cigarette, keys, purse.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.481
We got stats now on
our offender off that video.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.849
- Alrighty.
I'm on it, Sarge.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.284
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, you get plates?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.752
- Nah, nothing on the front
of the van.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.787
No chance for facial rec,
but there's a handicap pass

19:47.821 --> 19:49.656
on the rearview.
- OK.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.758
- The city only has nine
red Dodge vans

19:51.791 --> 19:53.293
assigned handicap passes.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.594
Six of them are owned
by one company,

19:54.627 --> 19:55.862
Home Wellness Aides.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.731
Company website has pictures
of every one of their employees

19:57.764 --> 19:59.532
in red polos,
just like our offender.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.900
- Beautiful.
I'll hit it now.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.869
Hey, run the scene.
Find me that van.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.371
- Hey, boss.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.639
Only thing is,
the original victims,

20:06.673 --> 20:08.842
they were taken from
their homes late at night.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.377
Organized, meticulous.
This--

20:10.410 --> 20:12.045
- I know it doesn't fit.
It doesn't matter.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.513
A girl was abducted.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.716
Let's find her.
- You got it.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.952
- No, I can't just give
that information out.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.488
Do you have a warrant?

20:21.521 --> 20:25.291
- 37 minutes ago,
a man in a red polo shirt

20:25.325 --> 20:27.060
violently abducted
a woman off the street.

20:27.093 --> 20:30.597
He dragged her
into one of your vans.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.799
Now, he's a white male,
brown hair,

20:32.832 --> 20:34.601
6'5", 280 pounds.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.969
Who could that be?
- Oh, my God.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.904
That's Kyle.
- Kyle who?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.040
- Kyle Hogan.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.908
- Kim, are you there?
- Go for Kim.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.810
- Name is Kyle Hogan.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.378
Can you track your vans?
- Yes.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.846
Yes.
- All right.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.048
I got his address.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.550
It is 3277 Boardman Avenue.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.819
Get a team over there
right now.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.789
Here's his plate--
9, Frank, 14, X-ray, 5.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.824
- Copy, putting it out now.
- Oh, no.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.925
- "Oh, no" what?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.427
- Normally we can track them,

21:00.460 --> 21:02.062
but Kyle's GPS
isn't showing up.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.630
Maybe he turned it off?

21:03.663 --> 21:05.065
He's due at a client's
in five minutes.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.700
- OK, where?

21:06.733 --> 21:09.069
[engine rumbles]

21:09.102 --> 21:12.939
[tense music]

21:12.972 --> 21:14.941
- We got the van, Sarge.
It's empty.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.043
There's fresh blood
on the door.

21:17.077 --> 21:19.679
* *

21:19.713 --> 21:21.348
- All right, Torres,
you cover the back.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.483
Kev, you're with me.
Grab a bar.

21:23.516 --> 21:27.387
OK, we're quiet till we're not.

21:27.420 --> 21:33.760
* *

21:33.793 --> 21:35.662
- In position.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.864
[doorbell rings]

21:37.897 --> 21:41.468
* *

21:41.501 --> 21:43.737
- Hey, good afternoon,
Chicago Police.

21:43.770 --> 21:44.904
- What's going on?

21:44.938 --> 21:47.374
- Oh, we got a call about
a noise complaint in the area.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.609
You hear anything?
- No.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.745
I was running the bath.
- Oh, is this your home?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.613
- No, I'm a health aide.
- Oh, good for you.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.081
How long you been here today?

21:55.115 --> 21:57.384
- Just started, 10 minutes ago.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.918
- Mind if I come in,
take a look around?

21:58.952 --> 22:00.620
- Mm.
This isn't my house.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.522
- I'll just be a minute.
What's your name?

22:04.791 --> 22:06.059
[door slams]

22:06.092 --> 22:08.128
Breaching front!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.396
- [grunts]

22:09.429 --> 22:10.630
[metal clattering]

22:10.663 --> 22:12.599
- Chicago PD!
All right.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.767
Clear left.
I got upstairs.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.001
- Mm-hmm.

22:15.035 --> 22:18.672
- Where's Ellie?
Where's Hogan?

22:18.705 --> 22:25.679
* *

22:34.854 --> 22:36.189
- Hey!
Slow down.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.526
[grunting]

22:42.962 --> 22:44.531
[desk clattering]

22:44.564 --> 22:47.067
[both shouting and grunting]

22:47.100 --> 22:48.702
[glass shatters]

22:48.735 --> 22:49.736
- Kev?

22:49.769 --> 22:50.670
[muffled shouting]

22:50.704 --> 22:53.640
Kev, talk to me!
- [grunting]

22:55.709 --> 22:57.844
[groans]

22:58.578 --> 23:00.814
- Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.949
[grunts]

23:02.982 --> 23:04.651
[groans]
Torres!

23:04.684 --> 23:06.019
Breach!

23:06.052 --> 23:07.587
[crashing]

23:07.620 --> 23:09.889
- Atwater!
- [spits]

23:09.923 --> 23:12.992
[wheezes]
Go! Go, go!

23:13.026 --> 23:15.829
- [grunting]

23:15.862 --> 23:21.634
* *

23:21.668 --> 23:22.869
- Hey!

23:24.804 --> 23:27.974
[both grunting]

23:28.008 --> 23:34.914
* *

23:43.890 --> 23:45.759
- Hey, enough!

23:45.792 --> 23:46.826
Stop fighting.

23:49.129 --> 23:51.698
- [laughs]

23:51.731 --> 23:52.732
[spits]

23:52.766 --> 23:57.504
* *

24:00.907 --> 24:02.909
- We recovered Ellie's blood
from Hogan's van,

24:02.942 --> 24:05.011
as well as hair and prints.

24:05.045 --> 24:06.646
- And the client's house?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.982
- No signs of Ellie.
No visible blood.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.950
Forensics is still scrubbing,
but it doesn't seem

24:10.984 --> 24:12.152
like she was ever there.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.787
- So we have
a one-hour timeline

24:13.820 --> 24:16.022
between Ellie's disappearance
and Hogan's arrival

24:16.056 --> 24:17.624
at the client's house.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.293
He must have
dropped her somewhere.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.228
- Right, how old is Hogan?

24:22.262 --> 24:24.097
- 29.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.934
- So he would have been 14
during the '09 rapes?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.169
- That's right.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.837
- Hmm.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.649
Where's Ellie?

24:47.087 --> 24:49.689
Jamie Mackinson.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.098
Her boyfriend saw you
abduct her from her home.

24:58.131 --> 25:02.002
She ended up dying from
the injuries you gave her.

25:02.035 --> 25:04.204
That's murder one.

25:04.237 --> 25:06.573
Life in a box.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.709
Now, where's Ellie?

25:11.911 --> 25:13.613
OK.

25:13.646 --> 25:17.217
That's you abducting Ellie
into your van.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.152
[tapping]

25:19.185 --> 25:21.921
We have it on video.

25:21.955 --> 25:25.158
Hey!
You getting the trend here?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.293
I have you.

25:27.327 --> 25:31.297
Now, where is she?

25:31.331 --> 25:35.001
This is your one shot to make
things better for yourself.

25:35.035 --> 25:37.370
You talk to me, I help you.

25:37.404 --> 25:39.706
Now, where is Ellie?

25:42.042 --> 25:44.678
[sighs]
OK.

25:48.148 --> 25:49.616
[ominous music]

25:49.649 --> 25:52.018
[sighs]
Let me ask you this.

25:52.052 --> 25:56.389
* *

25:56.423 --> 25:59.225
She doesn't match the others.

25:59.259 --> 26:00.994
All the other women,
they're brunette,

26:01.027 --> 26:05.231
in their 30s, taken from
their home late at night.

26:05.265 --> 26:06.800
Ellie's blonde.

26:06.833 --> 26:10.136
She's 22,
taken in broad daylight.

26:10.170 --> 26:14.374
It was bold.
Why?

26:14.407 --> 26:17.043
I mean, why did you change?
Why her?

26:19.312 --> 26:23.283
- She was begging for it.
- Mm.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.385
She caused you anguish?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.153
- What?

26:27.187 --> 26:30.390
Caused me English?
What the hell are you saying?

26:32.092 --> 26:34.060
- I'm saying you changed
your pattern.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.962
It wasn't smart.

26:37.731 --> 26:41.034
I mean, you've always taken
your women at night.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.371
It was planned, intelligent,
and sophisticated, even.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.740
Yet you took Ellie--

26:46.773 --> 26:48.775
it was broad daylight.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.444
I'm asking you why.

26:51.478 --> 26:54.047
Why?
Why did it change?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.815
Hmm?

26:57.817 --> 27:00.053
- Because I can make
decisions too.

27:00.086 --> 27:05.025
* *

27:05.058 --> 27:07.327
- You know,
I never said you couldn't.

27:07.360 --> 27:11.464
* *

27:11.498 --> 27:15.702
Someone else did, though.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.339
He said
you're just muscle, dumb,

27:19.372 --> 27:22.342
like a dog who takes orders.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.311
That's what your partner said.

27:25.345 --> 27:27.147
Nice, huh?

27:27.180 --> 27:29.849
* *

27:29.883 --> 27:32.085
He said you're his dog.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.287
He makes you fetch.
Then he feeds you treats.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.023
[chair thuds]
- Hmm.

27:37.057 --> 27:40.827
[laughs]
You trying to trick me?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.229
It won't work.
I want my lawyer.

27:43.263 --> 27:47.267
* *

27:47.300 --> 27:49.235
I know you're a liar.

27:49.269 --> 27:51.237
He would never say any of that.

27:51.271 --> 27:54.074
* *

27:54.107 --> 27:55.809
- Is that right?

28:01.981 --> 28:02.148
.

28:02.182 --> 28:02.982
- Hey, Hogan admitted
he has a partner.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.453
It could be
the original offender.

28:06.486 --> 28:09.923
It tracks, would explain
the change in MOs.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.158
- Could explain Hogan's age.
- Yes!

28:12.192 --> 28:14.060
All right,
so tell me we got a way to ID

28:14.094 --> 28:16.096
this partner,
a way to find Ellie.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.964
- We tracked Hogan's van
from the laundromat,

28:17.997 --> 28:20.033
but it entered a dead zone.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.469
We lost eyes from PODs
on this area right here.

28:22.502 --> 28:24.204
- OK, so what connects Hogan
to that area?

28:24.237 --> 28:25.772
- It's hard to say.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.374
He doesn't have any family
or friends over there,

28:27.407 --> 28:30.810
according to his phone
or socials.

28:30.844 --> 28:32.278
- What about clients?

28:32.312 --> 28:35.315
- Huh.
Let me see.

28:35.348 --> 28:38.885
So from McKinley Road
to Franklin and Boylston,

28:38.918 --> 28:41.788
he's got one client.

28:41.821 --> 28:46.059
Edgar Penn, 55,
retired mechanical engineer.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.029
His brother is Stuart Penn,
the defense attorney.

28:49.062 --> 28:52.032
- Oh, I know Stuart.
He's a shameless prick.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.034
- He got popped
for solicitation in the '90s.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.468
He got rough,
strangled a prostitute.

28:55.502 --> 28:58.171
She called the police.
Bad victim.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.106
His brother took care
of the whole thing.

29:00.140 --> 29:02.275
According to the health agency,
he was diagnosed

29:02.308 --> 29:06.046
with MS 15 years ago.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.915
- Well, that would explain
why the rapes stopped.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.817
Penn became
physically incapable.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.585
- And Hogan's been
his aide for six months.

29:12.619 --> 29:15.055
- Ah, now it all makes sense.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.123
Penn found someone with
the same appetites as him,

29:17.157 --> 29:19.092
someone physically able
to abduct women.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.161
- Penn's house is
in that dead zone.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.063
Hogan could have easily
dropped Ellie off there

29:23.096 --> 29:24.998
and got into his client's home
by the time we met him.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.534
- [sighs]
This is it.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.973
- And you believe Ellie
is being held

29:34.007 --> 29:36.076
at this Edgar Penn's home?
- Yes.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.210
- We understand
this isn't enough

29:37.243 --> 29:38.511
for an arrest warrant,
Your Honor.

29:38.545 --> 29:39.913
We're hoping
for a search warrant

29:39.946 --> 29:41.414
under exigent circumstances.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.451
- And so you pulled me from
my grandson's school recital?

29:44.484 --> 29:47.153
[applause]
- Yes, Your Honor.

29:47.187 --> 29:49.089
We believe this is
a life-or-death situation.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.357
- Well,
you're entitled to believe

29:50.390 --> 29:51.891
in pink unicorns, Ms. Chapman,

29:51.925 --> 29:53.393
but as an assistant
state's attorney,

29:53.426 --> 29:55.395
it is your duty to meet
the burden of proof.

29:55.428 --> 29:56.596
I can't do anything with this.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.498
- We're asking
for exigent circumstances.

29:58.531 --> 29:59.566
We meet that burden.

29:59.599 --> 30:01.868
- You do not.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.604
- Penn has a documented history
of sexual assault.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.239
15 years ago, he got sick.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.109
That's why he stopped
until he met Hogan.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.044
Penn taught Hogan everything.

30:11.077 --> 30:14.247
But Hogan went off book
and abducted Ellie Miller.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.982
Then he stashed her
at Penn's house,

30:16.016 --> 30:17.650
where she's being held
right now.

30:17.684 --> 30:19.085
- On what evidence?

30:19.119 --> 30:22.255
Can you put the van
at Penn's house today?

30:22.288 --> 30:23.623
Any electronic communication
between them?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.892
A statement from Hogan?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.660
This is Stuart Penn's brother.

30:27.694 --> 30:29.329
He would have me impeached.

30:29.362 --> 30:30.663
- That's your concern here?

30:30.697 --> 30:34.367
- My concern is probable cause.

30:36.036 --> 30:39.272
- So you--you're just going
back to your evening?

30:39.305 --> 30:42.575
- I signed 26 of your warrants
in the past month,

30:42.609 --> 30:44.177
Sergeant Voight.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.013
26, that's an insane number.
Yet I signed them.

30:47.047 --> 30:48.682
- A woman is being raped!

30:48.715 --> 30:52.152
- Do not do that.
I'm doing my job.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.487
- It doesn't
look like it to me.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.524
- You haven't
done your job yet.

30:57.557 --> 30:59.025
Go do it.

30:59.059 --> 31:01.494
[soft dramatic music]

31:01.528 --> 31:04.097
- OK, you don't have
to hold me back.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.999
I'm not a pet.
- Jesus.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.168
You really thought snapping
with him would work?

31:08.201 --> 31:09.369
- You know,
I don't care about him.

31:09.402 --> 31:11.438
I just care about
not failing them again.

31:11.471 --> 31:12.706
- Again?

31:12.739 --> 31:14.674
You didn't fail them
the first time.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.277
Hank, I read the files.
I read the cases.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.379
There wasn't evidence.
Your police work was flawless.

31:19.412 --> 31:20.947
- Oh, really?

31:20.980 --> 31:24.284
Then why isn't Penn
rotting in a jail cell?

31:24.317 --> 31:26.119
Why is there a woman
being held right now,

31:26.152 --> 31:27.387
and I can't get to her?

31:27.420 --> 31:30.990
- Because you can't win
every case.

31:31.024 --> 31:34.527
- I took that case five days
after I buried my wife,

31:34.561 --> 31:38.231
because I needed the work.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.600
I wasn't OK.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.970
So I don't know what I missed,

31:44.004 --> 31:47.207
but I am not missing
anything this time.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.175
* *

31:49.209 --> 31:52.479
- OK, then let's go find more.

31:52.512 --> 31:59.452
* *

32:02.422 --> 32:05.358
- In position.

32:05.392 --> 32:07.394
- All right, cut it.

[indistinct radio chatter]

32:23.309 --> 32:25.211
- He's got every window shade
down in front.

32:25.245 --> 32:27.514
We can't see a thing, Sarge.

32:27.547 --> 32:29.416
- We got nothing in the yard.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.017
- Pulling trash now.

32:31.051 --> 32:37.223
* *

32:37.257 --> 32:40.293
- All back windows are dark.
Shades are drawn here too.

32:40.326 --> 32:45.432
* *

32:45.465 --> 32:48.435
- What was she like?

32:48.468 --> 32:50.670
- What?

32:50.704 --> 32:52.672
- Your wife, Camille.

32:52.706 --> 32:57.210
* *

32:57.243 --> 32:59.045
- Warm.

32:59.079 --> 33:03.183
* *

33:03.216 --> 33:06.052
- It's hard to picture you
like that.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.621
- What?
Domesticated?

33:08.655 --> 33:10.423
- [chuckles]

33:10.457 --> 33:12.659
No, belonging to someone.

33:12.692 --> 33:17.297
* *

33:17.330 --> 33:20.500
- Trash is secure.
Moving out.

33:20.533 --> 33:21.801
- House is clean.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.671
It's all real clean,
too clean.

33:24.704 --> 33:30.176
* *

33:30.210 --> 33:32.278
I mean, literally,
every single piece of trash,

33:32.312 --> 33:33.079
bleached.

33:33.113 --> 33:34.147
Burgess is still
working the boxes,

33:34.180 --> 33:36.383
but every piece that
we recovered is wiped clean.

33:36.416 --> 33:37.817
- There's no DNA,
no prints on nothing.

33:37.851 --> 33:39.386
We can't put Ellie there.

33:39.419 --> 33:41.421
- Well, you know,
that is suspicious behavior.

33:41.454 --> 33:42.856
We can put that
in front of a judge.

33:42.889 --> 33:45.225
- We already tried.
Noes all across the board.

33:45.258 --> 33:46.626
- And the sneak-and-peek
brought up nothing.

33:46.659 --> 33:48.128
- So did the cell tower dump.

33:48.161 --> 33:50.597
- All right,
previous victims, then.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.432
What's the connect
between Jamie and Penn,

33:52.465 --> 33:54.668
Penn and the '09 victims?
- We don't know yet.

33:54.701 --> 33:55.835
- This man seems to be smart.

33:55.869 --> 33:58.505
It appears that every woman
he selected was at random.

33:58.538 --> 34:01.408
- Well, Hogan is not smart.
What do we have on him?

34:01.441 --> 34:02.876
- I've proffered
everything I can.

34:02.909 --> 34:05.612
He's not biting,
won't say a word.

34:05.645 --> 34:07.180
- OK, Suzanne?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.115
- She can't ID Penn.

34:09.149 --> 34:10.517
He kept a mask on her
the whole time,

34:10.550 --> 34:11.851
modulated his voice.

34:11.885 --> 34:13.586
We got nothing
on the Polaroids or notes.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.622
Same with our past victims.

34:15.655 --> 34:16.856
- Handwriting?
- Mm-mm.

34:16.890 --> 34:18.591
Because of the progression
of Penn's MS,

34:18.625 --> 34:20.226
experts couldn't make a match.

34:20.260 --> 34:21.828
- Penn's neighbors?
- We contacted them.

34:21.861 --> 34:23.329
We might get more answers
in the morning,

34:23.363 --> 34:25.231
but so far, we got nothing.
- Come on.

34:25.265 --> 34:26.766
Somebody had to see
or hear something.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.502
- You'd think.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.438
- Listen to me.

34:31.471 --> 34:33.807
There has got to be a connect.
There's gotta be one.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.241
OK?

34:35.275 --> 34:37.744
Penn made a mistake,
believe me.

34:37.777 --> 34:40.146
It's either now
or 15 years ago.

34:40.180 --> 34:42.482
So we go through it all again.

35:01.835 --> 35:03.803
I got a search warrant.

35:03.837 --> 35:05.805
Different judge, Judge Reyes.

35:05.839 --> 35:07.640
I found precedents,
emergency aid exceptions.

35:07.674 --> 35:09.209
- What?

35:09.242 --> 35:10.210
- You can move on Penn's house.
We're good.

35:10.243 --> 35:12.212
- Let's go.

35:16.916 --> 35:19.786

I'm police.

36:37.063 --> 36:38.698
I got you.
I'm gonna cut you free.

36:38.732 --> 36:39.833
You're safe now.

I got you.

It's OK.
Can I help you?

36:53.046 --> 36:54.814
Can I--
- No!

36:54.848 --> 36:56.850

OK.

Gonna be OK.
OK? You're safe.

You're OK.

Well, you invited me here.

to our warrant?

You could have ended
your career,

39:31.237 --> 39:32.772
probably taken mine down
with it.

39:32.806 --> 39:34.040

And if they do,
I won't ever let it get--

39:35.508 --> 39:37.610
- No, that is not how it works.

39:37.644 --> 39:41.548
You don't lie for me.
You don't protect me.

39:41.581 --> 39:42.849
- Why not?

39:42.882 --> 39:44.584
- Because that's
not how it works!

What do you mean?

I'm not in your unit, Hank.

- Yes.

If I want to care about you,
if I want to protect you,

to risk what I want to risk,
to make my own choices,

40:48.848 --> 40:50.950
