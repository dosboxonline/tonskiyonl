[announcer in Japanese] And now,
the moment you have all been waiting for.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.771
The final match of the Sekai Taikai!

[dramatic music plays]

00:47.881 --> 00:49.424
[man in English] Kill him, Miyagi-san!

00:50.008 --> 00:50.925
Mr. Miyagi?

00:51.968 --> 00:52.802
What is this?

What are you doing?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.252
[in English] Enough. Just talk to me.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.212
There's so much you never told me.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.673
I just need to understand why.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.883
That was always your problem, Daniel-san.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
So eager to understand,

02:16.052 --> 02:18.596
but not willing to accept. [yells]

02:39.868 --> 02:42.662
Miyagi never tell you everything,
Daniel-san,

02:42.745 --> 02:44.706
because you were never strong enough

02:44.789 --> 02:47.125
to accept truth. [yells]

02:47.208 --> 02:51.087
[breathes shakily]

03:01.681 --> 03:03.433
[Gunther] This is the traditional seal.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.478
The names of the officials
match our records.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.398
These are the authentic
Sekai Taikai results.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.066
No question.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.404
Sadly, the rare death
did occur in that era.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.533
It was a… different time.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.619
[somber music plays]

03:22.702 --> 03:23.828
[woman whispers]

03:23.912 --> 03:26.623
[Gunther] Hmm. I see. Okay.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.835
Senseis, you'll have to excuse me.
Something has come up.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.921
[somber music continues]

03:34.380 --> 03:37.258
-[Chozen] Sorry, Daniel-san.
-Yeah, it really sucks, man.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.261
But you heard. People died
in fights sometimes back then.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.555
Maybe it was just some freak accident.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.642
But right now, Miyagi-Do's in the finals,
and Cobra Kai's out.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.435
Doesn't get much better than that.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.479
Except winning the whole thing.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.065
Right.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.109
We should get back to the kids.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.455
I don't know.
And then that's it, probably.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.748
-[Sam] Oh man.
-[Miguel] I know.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.084
Are you kidding me? Another one?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.254
Two sponsors dropped me already.
Three more are threatening.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.217
That bitch is lucky she's eliminated,
or I'd wipe the mat with her face.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.178
[Sam] I wonder what kinda sightseeing
we can get in before the fight.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.013
I mean, I know we saw…

04:24.097 --> 04:25.765
Okay, what is this guy's problem?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.939
The night that you flew home,

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
I ended up running into him on the beach.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.235
And we got talking,

04:37.318 --> 04:40.488
and I guess he got the wrong idea

04:40.571 --> 04:42.573
and tried to kiss me.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.701
I mean, I… I shut it down.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.411
And nothing happened.

04:47.870 --> 04:52.125
He knows I have a boyfriend. I guess
he's just… not taking it super well.

04:53.084 --> 04:53.918
[Miguel] Yeah.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.462
I get it, but clearly he doesn't.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.302
[somber music plays]

05:08.891 --> 05:09.767
Hey.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.312
You going back home already?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.231
You okay?

05:16.065 --> 05:17.942
Pretty far from it.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.402
Look. I, um…

05:20.778 --> 05:22.196
I owe you an apology.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.449
I should've never let Kwon
get into my head.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.660
I know better than that.
I know you better than that.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.288
Pressure of the tournament
got to me, and--

05:30.371 --> 05:31.497
I can't do this right now.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.209
This whole thing just turned to shit.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.462
Like everything always does.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.798
I never should've let myself
believe in any of it.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.511
Does "any of it" include me?

05:46.929 --> 05:48.139
[Kwon] Not your team.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.309
[speaks Korean]

05:52.101 --> 05:53.353
It means, uh…

05:53.436 --> 05:56.105
[inhales] How would you say in American?

05:56.981 --> 05:59.233
Lucky bastard.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.278
What happened in match yesterday

06:02.779 --> 06:04.197
will never

06:05.239 --> 06:06.199
happen

06:06.866 --> 06:07.825
again.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.911
[tense music plays]

06:19.295 --> 06:21.339
It's a good thing
I don't have to find out.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.425
Lucky me.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.306
Get home safe.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.058
Please.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.226
See you there.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.977
[tense music continues]

06:39.273 --> 06:41.692
[Kwon] Byung-Shin does not deserve
to be in next round.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.820
That is my spot.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.155
I guess you shouldn't have
let him kick your ass.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.242
What did you say?

06:49.325 --> 06:50.326
[Tory] You heard me.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.994
You cost me my spot.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.122
And what would you have done with it?

06:54.205 --> 06:56.666
Zara would destroy you,

06:56.749 --> 06:58.960
then celebrate with your boyfriend.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.045
[tense music continues]

07:01.587 --> 07:02.505
Say that again.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.673
You heard me.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.425
[tense music continues]

07:06.717 --> 07:08.344
-[speaks Korean]
-[Kim Da-Eun] Enough!

07:10.096 --> 07:14.016
We are already returning
to my grandfather in disgrace.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.270
Are you trying to add to our shame?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.648
[in Korean] Get your mind right.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.532
-[in English] Hey, bro. How'd it go?
-[sighs] Pretty much how you'd expect it.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.743
Once all the craziness dies down,
you guys are gonna figure it out.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.873
Maybe. Not much I can do until then
but give her room. So…

07:38.499 --> 07:41.085
In the meantime,
we got a tournament to win.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.920
Yeah, we do. [chuckles]

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
And look, I… I gotta say,
all things being equal,

07:45.548 --> 07:48.843
it's pretty sweet knowing
that Cobra Kai's not a threat anymore.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.222
[ominous music plays]

07:53.931 --> 07:55.975
[police officer] John Kreese,
you're under arrest.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.268
What did you do?

07:58.936 --> 08:00.771
[Silver] You look a little tense, John.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.691
Just like the old days.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.905
Why couldn't you let sleeping dogs lie?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.448
[elevator dings]

08:11.491 --> 08:15.369
-[man 1] Yes. Thank you so much.
-[Silver] Great to meet you.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.830
[Master Kim] Always focus on prize.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.415
[ominous music plays]

08:19.499 --> 08:21.542
Never see enemies standing in way.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.628
[ominous music continues]

08:25.254 --> 08:26.255
[Silver] Talk to me.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.759
[Master Kim] Now you understand…

08:32.011 --> 08:32.845
[Silver] All right.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.724
[Master Kim] …that nothing
will ever stand in our way

08:37.725 --> 08:38.726
again.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.353
[ominous music continues]

08:42.939 --> 08:43.773
[Silver] Perfect.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.441
Yes.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.402
Just make sure
they blast it out to the world.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.156
[Wolf] Who was that?

08:52.698 --> 08:53.658
[Silver] My media team.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.369
I wanna make sure
press around the world covers this.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.205
-Are your fighters ready?
-[Wolf] Zara and Axel are always ready.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.333
Miyagi-Do will be humiliated
in front of everyone.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.835
[Silver] Too bad
we can't humiliate Cobra Kai.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.505
-They already did that to themselves.
-[Wolf laughs]

09:07.588 --> 09:09.090
[Silver] Yeah. [laughs]

09:12.843 --> 09:15.429
[announcer over PA] Attention,
Sekai Taikai competitors.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.849
All dojos convene immediately
in the main lobby,

09:18.933 --> 09:21.435
including those who have been eliminated.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.859
[Gunther] My apologies
for summoning you all like this.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.488
But under the circumstances,
it was necessary.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.032
The Sekai Taikai has a long

09:35.116 --> 09:36.617
and honorable tradition.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.744
We fight hard,

09:39.453 --> 09:40.538
but we fight fair.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.706
That's why

09:42.290 --> 09:43.916
I'm saddened to announce

09:44.000 --> 09:45.960
that one of the dojos here

09:46.043 --> 09:48.713
has tarnished that tradition by cheating.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.922
-[man 1] Whoa.
-[woman] Who?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.090
Cheating?

09:52.508 --> 09:53.342
[man 2] What?!

09:53.843 --> 09:55.553
[tense music plays]

09:56.429 --> 09:57.430
Sensei Ivanov.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.390
[tense music continues]

10:01.100 --> 10:05.646
Four of your students have tested positive
for performance-enhancing drugs.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.692
-[man 3] That's just not right.
-[man 4] I knew it!

10:09.775 --> 10:12.820
-You are hereby eliminated.
-What the hell are you talking about?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.489
-You're hereby removed from our finalists.
-Bullshit!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.285
Why don't you come over here
and remove me yourself?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.328
Sensei Ivanov!

10:20.411 --> 10:21.829
[dramatic music plays]

10:21.912 --> 10:25.207
Consider yourself fortunate
that your dojo wasn't banned forever.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.918
Continue this behavior,

10:29.378 --> 10:32.465
and that could be arranged easily!

10:32.548 --> 10:33.799
[dramatic music continues]

10:40.431 --> 10:42.350
Replacing Udar Tigra

10:42.433 --> 10:45.519
will be the dojo
with the next highest point total.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.437
Wait.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.105
That means…

10:48.189 --> 10:49.315
Cobra Kai.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.692
[dramatic music plays]

10:51.776 --> 10:53.444
-Yeah! Yes!
-[Yoon] Yes!

10:54.111 --> 10:55.196
Of course.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.368
[Gunther] And on a more positive note,

11:00.451 --> 11:03.663
we'll now announce
the draws for our semifinals.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.998
[tense music plays]

11:08.250 --> 11:09.752
In our girls' bracket,

11:09.835 --> 11:11.921
the first semifinal will be

11:12.546 --> 11:13.964
Maria Àlvarez

11:14.548 --> 11:17.593
versus Zara Malik.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.763
And in the second match,

11:21.472 --> 11:23.849
that will pit Tory Nichols…

11:25.851 --> 11:28.813
against Samantha LaRusso.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.898
[tense music continues]

11:32.775 --> 11:36.362
[Gunther] In our boys' bracket,
our first semifinal match

11:36.445 --> 11:37.446
will be

11:37.988 --> 11:39.949
Diego Aguilar

11:40.616 --> 11:42.410
versus Kwon Jae-Sung.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.497
And our second semifinal match will pit

11:46.580 --> 11:48.999
Axel Kovačević

11:49.083 --> 11:51.460
against Robby Keene.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.461
[Robby grunts]

11:52.545 --> 11:54.213
[tense music continues]

11:54.922 --> 11:57.717
[Gunther] Good luck
to all our semifinalists.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.428
We look forward
to seeing you tomorrow at the venue.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.596
[tense music continues]

12:07.852 --> 12:11.063
Axel the Invincible,
and Sam-Tory chapter a billion.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.149
It's less than ideal.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.569
You got this.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.241
[Johnny] Screw this horseshit, man.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.536
How many times
do we have to kill that son of a bitch?

12:25.619 --> 12:27.496
Kreese is like a cockroach.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.749
But he is not one fighting on mat.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.669
Sensei Chozen's right. We have the rest
of the day to tune up for tomorrow.

12:34.962 --> 12:35.921
What's the plan?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.299
Knock Kreese's head off his neck,
for starters.

12:41.010 --> 12:41.927
[Sam] Dad?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.222
-Dad?
-What?

12:46.640 --> 12:47.475
Training?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.810
For our final fights?

12:50.519 --> 12:52.188
We'll run through the usual stuff.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.193
Senseis need time to discuss.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.738
Go get changed. Uh, meet me at gym, hmm.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.001
Must pull heads out of asses.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.336
Forget Kreese.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.504
Forget Miyagi-san.

13:16.587 --> 13:19.840
Sam and Robby face strong opponents.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.008
Great pressure.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.093
They need guidance.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.428
Need senseis.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.972
They need their fathers.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.477
I will warm them up

13:31.560 --> 13:34.355
while you think of one last lesson.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.106
But think quickly,

13:36.190 --> 13:38.984
or I will pull heads from asses for you.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.203
Maybe we need to smack 'em around a bit.

13:50.037 --> 13:50.996
Not actually us.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.249
Get eight to ten locals.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.458
Give 'em some pesos.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.003
Line 'em up,
and let Sam and Robby run the gauntlet.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.632
Terrific. As long as the kids are out
of the hospital in time for their matches.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.426
[Johnny] Toguchi's right, man.
This is our last kick at the can.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.637
Got any better ideas, let me know.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.307
How about not endangering our captains
before they even step on the mat?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.142
-Come on.
-News flash, LaRusso.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.436
The world's a dangerous place.
They can handle it.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.355
What the hell you think
we've been teaching 'em?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.525
I'm beginning
to wonder that myself these days.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.820
I opened up Miyagi-Do
to help these kids defend themselves.

14:22.903 --> 14:26.532
And now it's just been
one fight after another.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.158
Maybe defense only is just

14:29.368 --> 14:30.286
bullshit.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.538
Maybe we're not supposed to be here.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.874
Wanna doubt everything
Miyagi taught you? Go nuts.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.085
Don't tell me you're thinking
of backing out at the finish line.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.504
Look, Miyagi-Do
was never about tournaments.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.172
Unbelievable.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.343
I should've known, as soon as the shit
hit the fan, you'd pussy out.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.679
Oh. There's the asshole I know.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.140
Kreese never fails
to bring him out, does he?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.684
To guys like you and him,
everyone's a pussy.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.853
No, not everyone. Just you.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.646
Biggest pussy I ever met.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.732
Call me pussy again, see what happens.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.859
I've called you pussy 1,000 times.
You don't do shit.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.195
Well, you've caught me
on a pretty shitty day.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.947
[Miguel] Hey, hey, hey!

15:08.365 --> 15:09.992
What the hell are you two doing?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.835
[Kreese] Second chances
don't come very often.

15:20.711 --> 15:24.506
But I will be damned
if we don't make the best of this one.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.966
[tense music plays]

15:26.050 --> 15:28.594
We will return home with honor.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.399
The two of you have been chosen
as my champions.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.359
[Kwon exclaims]

15:45.402 --> 15:48.447
Because both of you
have that fight inside you.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.451
-[Tory grunts]
-Now it is time to let it all out.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.079
Harness your pain.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.207
-Focus that rage.
-[Kwon grunts]

15:59.124 --> 16:00.584
And target your enemy.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.504
And then,

16:05.339 --> 16:06.465
and only then…

[Kreese] Nichols.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.230
[music fades]

16:22.064 --> 16:22.982
With me.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.779
[Kim Da-Eun speaks Korean]

16:30.155 --> 16:31.699
Sorry, I don't know what's wrong.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.742
-I'll get there.
-When?

16:35.035 --> 16:36.412
-What?
-When?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.374
Nichols, this is war.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.209
In war,

16:42.292 --> 16:43.752
you destroy your enemy,

16:44.294 --> 16:46.005
or your enemy destroys you.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.965
They're not my enemies.
They're my friends.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.800
Friends won't make you a champion.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.677
They'll let you down.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.637
[somber music plays]

16:53.721 --> 16:54.722
Betray you.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.517
And they certainly won't
help you out on that mat.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.354
Every one of us is alone in this world.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.442
You know that better than most.

17:08.110 --> 17:12.114
But if you go out there thinking
that Samantha LaRusso is your friend,

17:12.197 --> 17:17.119
then you can kiss your victory
and your future goodbye.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.204
[somber music continues]

17:20.998 --> 17:22.541
Do you understand?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.294
Yes, Sensei.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.547
I can't hear you.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.049
Yes, Sensei!

17:31.633 --> 17:32.468
Good.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.970
[somber music continues]

17:44.104 --> 17:44.938
[music fades]

17:45.898 --> 17:48.776
[Miguel] I'm not leaving until
the two of you tell me what's going on.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.819
It's fine with me. It's a topless beach.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.864
I'm serious. I thought
you guys were done with this shit.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.076
We were. But we never really are, I guess.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.329
LaRusso just found out
his sensei isn't who he thought he was.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.706
And I found out
mine is exactly who I thought he was.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.000
-And I'm never getting rid of him.
-[Miguel] It sucks.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.378
But it doesn't change the fact
that you turned a bunch of bullied kids

18:08.462 --> 18:12.007
into one of the most badass dojos
this world has ever seen. Okay?

18:12.091 --> 18:15.302
Sure, you taught us some things
that your senseis taught you,

18:15.385 --> 18:17.429
but you guys added
something new on top of it.

18:17.513 --> 18:18.388
I mean, shit.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.975
Did Kreese turn
a… a wimpy, skinny little kid

18:22.059 --> 18:24.228
into one of the All-Valley champs
in six months?

18:24.311 --> 18:27.022
-Did he fix me when I was broken?
-Not a chance.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.148
No way.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.691
And Mr. Miyagi, I mean,

18:29.775 --> 18:33.570
did he take every single one of those kids
from the Valley when Cobra Kai came back?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.448
Did he crane-kick Silver
out of the Valley for good?

18:37.616 --> 18:38.450
Okay!

18:38.534 --> 18:41.328
So are you two gonna let
your issues with your senseis

18:41.411 --> 18:43.288
keep you from doing
what you need to be doing?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.750
Going in there and being the senseis that
we need to win this world tournament?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.378
-Hell no.
-You make a good point.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.171
Damn right he does.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.091
What do you say we hit the gym
and get Sam and Robby ready to win this?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.176
[rock music plays]

you've all been waiting for.

20:34.942 --> 20:39.404
The Sekai Taikai Tournament of Champions.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.490
[dramatic music plays]

20:58.382 --> 21:01.718
Welcome, competitors,
to the semifinal round

21:01.802 --> 21:04.972
of the Sekai Taikai.

21:05.889 --> 21:09.851
Each dojo will retain the points
they have accumulated thus far.

21:11.311 --> 21:15.399
Each match will consist of
three two-minute rounds

21:15.482 --> 21:17.985
with unlimited scoring

21:18.068 --> 21:20.988
and no stoppages.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.156
One point for a hit.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.409
Ten for a knockdown.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.661
And should anyone score a knockout,

21:28.203 --> 21:29.454
that's worth 20.

21:30.414 --> 21:34.209
So it's still anyone's tournament to win.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.672
Because at this stage of the tournament,

21:39.298 --> 21:43.218
no deficit is too large to overcome.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.179
Best of luck to you all.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.474
And may the best dojo win.

It would be nice to step out on the mat
just once without any drama.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.410
There's always gonna be some kinda drama.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.997
You can't control that.
You can only control how you handle it.

you risk defeat.

I guess I've been wondering,
is it worth it?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.391
Is what worth it?

25:18.475 --> 25:19.559
Winning.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.936
Over everything else.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.147
That's what your grandfather's karate's
all about, right?
