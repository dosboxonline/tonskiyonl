- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, good evening.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.413
You realize you made
an illegal U-turn back there?

35:21.413 --> 35:24.582
(CHUCKLES) Honestly, officer,
had I known it was illegal,

35:24.582 --> 35:26.626
would I have done it?
Of course, not.

35:26.626 --> 35:28.920
Is there any reason that you
weren't paying attention?

35:28.920 --> 35:30.714
You see that billboard up there

35:30.714 --> 35:31.923
with Sienna Miller?

35:31.923 --> 35:33.425
You see what's going on
up there?

35:33.425 --> 35:36.594
You do know we've had a rash
of these penises on billboards

35:36.594 --> 35:38.221
- all over this neighborhood?
- Terrible. Terrible.

35:38.221 --> 35:39.305
(CHUCKLING) The thing is,

35:39.305 --> 35:41.349
I saw that billboard,
and I went,

35:41.349 --> 35:43.435
"Oh, my God, I got to get
a picture of this.

35:43.435 --> 35:45.603
It's Sienna Miller."
I had a date with her.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.230
- We had a-- Yeah.
- OFFICER: You?

35:47.230 --> 35:48.481
Sir, you're--
you're like 50 years

35:48.481 --> 35:49.774
- older than she is.
- Yes, yes,

35:49.774 --> 35:52.360
I am considerably older,
but she pursued me, actually.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.195
To tell you the truth.
I know it's hard to believe,

35:54.195 --> 35:55.321
- but she did.
- (SCOFFS)

35:55.321 --> 35:57.115
By the way, that movie's
gonna do gangbusters

35:57.115 --> 35:59.325
- with those penises up there.
- Sir, that's sick.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.785
No, my friend's wife
had a caftan business,

36:00.785 --> 36:02.537
and she had a billboard,
and somebody drew dicks

36:02.537 --> 36:03.997
in her mouth
and business took off.

36:03.997 --> 36:05.373
OFFICER: Uh, Mr. David,

36:05.373 --> 36:07.834
can you explain to me why
you have a box of spray paint

36:07.834 --> 36:08.752
in the back of your car?

36:08.752 --> 36:10.337
I'm gonna be perfectly honest
with you.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.172
My friend and I went to this
all-you-can-eat restaurant.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.591
He ate too many crabs,
and they banned us.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.718
And so we went back
and spray painted,

36:16.718 --> 36:17.594
"Not all you can eat."

36:17.594 --> 36:19.012
You just admitted
to another crime.

36:19.012 --> 36:21.348
- Step out of the car, sir. Sir.
- But it's not all you can eat.

36:21.348 --> 36:22.557
- It's bullshit.
- OFFICER: Now.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.476
- It's not all you can eat.
- Out of the car now.

36:24.476 --> 36:26.436
- Oh, I didn't do that.
- That's disgusting.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.313
You think I drew those dicks
up there?

36:28.313 --> 36:29.814
- Yeah.
- I can't even draw a dick.

36:29.814 --> 36:30.690
I don't know how to draw.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.317
I can draw--
I can draw a breast maybe.

36:32.317 --> 36:33.401
- Yeah.
- I can't draw a dick.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.611
- That-- that's--
- Yeah.

36:34.611 --> 36:35.987
- I would never draw a dick.
- Still disgusting.
