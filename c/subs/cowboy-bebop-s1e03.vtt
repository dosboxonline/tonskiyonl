[man] Next customer!

00:36.995 --> 00:38.663
[music continues over headphones]

00:38.747 --> 00:43.334
I'll, uh…
I'll take the special. Extra tobiko.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.590
You know, I hear the sake here
on Mars is only good when it rains.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.508

[rooster crows in distance]

[clears throat]

01:25.585 --> 01:27.253
When you pick up your next order,

01:28.254 --> 01:30.423
I need to know whether
he still does his business from there.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.593
-Ana said there wouldn't be trouble.
-No trouble.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.846
Just information.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.563
I'll pick up a fresh supply
in a few hours.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.149
-How will I find you?
-You don't.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.528
Stay in the city, and I'll find you.

[theme music playing]

[lively music playing]

03:31.085 --> 03:32.462
[over TV] I'm Walking Sally.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.424
I walk and talk
and I'm every little girl's favorite toy.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.009
And we can be friends.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.678
For only 10,000 woolongs.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.390
But you have to act fast,
because I'm selling out everywhere.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.809
[male announcer] Supplies are limited,
so check with your local retailers.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.937
Don't miss out
on this extraordinary offer.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.856
-[Walking Sally] Come and get me!
-I swear, this doll, she's mocking me.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.109
[Walking Sally] Come and get me!
Come and get me! Come and get me!

03:55.693 --> 03:58.488
-Come and get me!
-[Jet] I can't shut this damn thing off!

03:58.571 --> 03:59.447
Come and get…

03:59.948 --> 04:02.492
You know how many toy stores
there are in Tharsis City?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.119
-Mm-mm.
-Seventy.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.998
Seventy toy stores and this goddamn doll
is sold out in every one of 'em.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.834
Now I'm doomed to show up
at Kimmie's birthday

04:11.918 --> 04:13.586
without the one thing she wanted.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.921
[grunts with frustration]

04:15.505 --> 04:17.966
Screw it.
Let's get the hell out of this city.

04:20.134 --> 04:23.554
Hey, slow your roll, big guy.
No reason to ditch out of Tharsis so fast.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.099
I'm sure we could find it
here on the black market.

04:26.182 --> 04:31.104
Sure, and already found a hookup. Chad.
Says he knows a guy who knows a guy.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.898
He also said it's going to cost me
more woos than retail.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.401
Barely 45 Gs in the kitty.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.028
It means we'll be choosing
between food and fuel.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.031
-You could sell your arm.
-I could put my fist up your ass.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.909
True. And it would feel really good,
but would it solve anything?

04:45.493 --> 04:47.203
Let's get off this rock.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.248
Buddy, there's no reason
to give up on Kimmie's happiness.

04:50.331 --> 04:53.918
I mean, you need some dough for a doll.
Let's just do what we do.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.920
-[Jet] I just want to get out of here.
-[Spike] Hang on.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.301
Look here, first hit. Fifteen million.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.887
"Wow, that is a lot of money, Spike."

05:04.971 --> 05:06.597
I know, Jet. It is.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.020
Look at this lowlife.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.064
He's going to be thrilled
to be your ticket to Kimmie's joy.

05:15.773 --> 05:16.983
[Jet sighs]

05:17.984 --> 05:21.404
I don't know.
Cops are already all over this one.

05:21.487 --> 05:25.408
Yeah, because the victims are wealthy.
ISSP lives to cater to the rich.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.909
Doesn't that make you wanna

05:26.993 --> 05:28.536
-grab him before they do?
-Hmm.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.664
-Come on, this is right up your alley.
-It is a big chunk of dough.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.499
It's right here in Tharsis.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.752
You hate Tharsis.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.297
I do. But you haven't seen
your daughter in years,

05:39.380 --> 05:42.925
which, I'm not going to lie to you,
affords me the right to contradict myself.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.928
What do you think?

05:47.138 --> 05:50.767
I think this image
is from a security camera.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.310
Which means we need Woodcock.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.604
I'm praying that's a person.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.855
[line ringing]

05:56.314 --> 05:58.566
-[beeps]
-[soft whirring]

05:59.275 --> 06:05.531
Well, well, well, look who comes a-calling
after all these years.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.908
Jet Black.

06:06.991 --> 06:07.825
[laughs]

06:07.909 --> 06:09.160
How are you, Woodcock?

06:09.243 --> 06:14.165
Better now there's a tall glass of creamy
chocolate milk standing in my eye-line.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.416
This is my partner.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.044
Pleasure. Seriously.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.129
You got a name, junior?

06:20.922 --> 06:23.049
Spike. Spike Spiegel.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.634
Hmm.

06:24.717 --> 06:28.388
You a good guy or a bad guy,
Shpike Shpiegel?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.516
Depends on who you ask.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.768
[chuckles]

06:33.851 --> 06:35.645
I like you, kitty-cat.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.938
[laughs]

06:37.021 --> 06:40.608
You know, Jet and I go way back,
and I mean way back.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.985
Used to call him "The Black Dog."
You wanna know why?

06:43.069 --> 06:46.614
-Oh, yes. God yes, please tell--
-Look. We're a little strapped for time.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.243
Yeah, don't get your slacks in a swivel.
I already know about this guy.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.954
I've had clients crawling up
my crack for days about him.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.372
But it's like I told them.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.083
If you're not from Earth,
you've got nothing to worry about.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.919
-What do you mean?
-Victims were all Earthers.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.588
We're talking
straight off the escape pods.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.882
Not sure how I can help though.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.553
I already handed
the security-cam footage over to the ISSP.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.431
But I'm guessing
you didn't hand them the raw footage.

07:11.514 --> 07:15.893
Don't you just know me so well.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.770
[sultry music playing]

07:17.854 --> 07:21.858
And suppose I give it to you,
what do I get in return?

07:22.859 --> 07:26.904
A big, fat thank you.
And we'll cut you in on the bounty, yeah?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.031
I was thinking
less along the lines of cash,

07:29.115 --> 07:32.368
more along the lines of… dinner.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.955
Me. You. A bottle of Chianti.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.375
Two bottles if we're feeling dangerous.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.255
Sounds to me like blackmail.

07:44.338 --> 07:48.593
Hmm, damn right it is because, Jet,
you are Black and you are male.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.388
-Seriously, favorite person ever.
-Fine.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.559
You do this for me
and we can talk about dinner.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.519
-How's that?
-Mm.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.813
That's a big fat RTC.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.149
-Reason to continue.
-[Spike chuckles]

08:06.944 --> 08:09.572
Transferring the footage
to you now, sweetness.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.951
-See you on the Chianti side.
-[chimes]

08:14.035 --> 08:15.453
[soft whirring]

08:19.457 --> 08:21.459
-[laughs]
-[Jet sighs]

08:22.877 --> 08:24.045
[Jet] Oh, my God.

08:26.964 --> 08:27.965
[clears throat]

08:33.429 --> 08:35.473
-Did you two-- Okay.
-Spike.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.851
-Seriously though--
-Spike, keep your eye on the ball.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
Hey. I'm not Woodcock, pal.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.147
-[laughing]
-Okay? [laughing]

08:51.531 --> 08:53.157
Wish we had the audio.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.620
He said, uh, "I'm gonna
make your little girl pay

08:57.703 --> 09:00.498
for what you rich assholes
did to me and my family."

09:00.581 --> 09:02.792
-You read lips?
-Yeah.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.836
Three years of us working together
and I'm just learning this now?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.296
Didn't come up a lot.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.589
Hmm.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.884
Well, if you're right,
this isn't just a robbery-homicide.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.427
It's a kidnapping.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.805
[Spike] And explains why
ISSP called in the cavalry.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.806
[Jet] Mm-hmm

09:16.889 --> 09:19.684
Which means there's a reward
on top of the bounty.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.854
So how do you want to play it?
I say we hit the last house.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.731
See if Sticky Fingers
left anything behind,

09:25.815 --> 09:28.025
like the diamond thief
we bagged down in Alba City.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.112
Diamond thief was sloppy.
This guy's a pro.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.530
[Spike] And he's cocky.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.617
Yeah, look at him. He's staring at
the camera like he wants to be seen.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.328
[Jet] Jesus. You're right.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.496
Wow.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.916
-Say it again.
-What?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.209
Say what you just said.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.253
-What, that you're right?
-Yes.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.546
Whoa. [laughs]

09:49.505 --> 09:50.423
Was that…

09:50.506 --> 09:53.926
I just needed to hear it one more time.
You know, to ceremonialize it.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.511
-[groans]
-God!

09:55.595 --> 09:58.097
-What am I right about again?
-He wants to be seen.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.015
Oh.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.350
Which means the cops
are looking for the wrong guy.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.435
Right.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.233
[Jet] Huh.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.444
You see that scar on his wrist?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.570
[Spike] Mm-hmm.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.324
Pretend I don't know what that means.

10:17.658 --> 10:22.163
It's a scar from a face-changer.
A totally obsolete tech these days.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.874
Now they're used
for hookers in peeler bars.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.127
You know, guy wants a blond,
but the girl's a brunette…

10:28.753 --> 10:29.587
Ah!

10:29.670 --> 10:31.088
Knew I had it.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.632
Yay.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.259
I was buddies with the guy
who figured that out, back in the day.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.345
What was his name? Um, Doc Holiday.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.514
Really? That was his name?
His name was actually Doc Holiday?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.684
No, it was Bill something.
But he figured out some bank thieves

10:43.768 --> 10:45.853
were using face-changers
to give us the slip.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.356
So Doc created a frequency scrambler.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.399
Yeah, but why'd you call him Doc Holiday?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.193
I didn't. Some guys on the force did.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.944
-Why did they?
-Hell if I know.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.447
-Was he a doctor?
-What? No!

10:56.530 --> 10:57.698
There's gotta be a reason.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.909
I don't know,
maybe he liked vacations, Spike.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.412
The point is, we use
the scrambler to glitch the bounty.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.623
Force him to go to
whatever low-rent brothel

11:05.706 --> 11:07.792
he got the thing from and get it fixed.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.294
If you had started
this conversation with "brothel,"

11:10.378 --> 11:12.546
we would have
saved ourselves a whole lot of time.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.215
Which one?

11:14.298 --> 11:15.591
[sighs]

11:15.675 --> 11:17.927
There's only two
low-rent brothels in Tharsis.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.388
Betty's Boop,

11:22.264 --> 11:23.724
and Betty's Bottom.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.059
[Jet] What's the difference?

11:25.142 --> 11:27.895
[Spike] One's on the Quimby side
of the red-light district,

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
the other's on the Cypress side.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.607
I'll take Cypress.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.984
-Actually, take Quimby.
-Why?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.820
'Cause if this doll thing
doesn't work out,

11:35.903 --> 11:38.114
they've got a really nice gift shop.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.367
[Jet] You know
what they don't have, smart guy?

11:41.450 --> 11:44.412
A frequency scrambler
that piggybacks on local signals.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.705
[Spike] Uh-huh.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.998
[Jet] Once I trigger,
it should cover the entire city.

11:48.082 --> 11:52.294
And send our guy running to whichever
brothel he bought it from to fix his face.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.379
Yeah, I got it.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.715
God damn.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.509
It's rough-trade central out here.
You getting hit on your end?

11:58.592 --> 12:00.928
Yep. Swimming in prosexuals.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.390
All right. Here goes everything.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.943
Oh, my. Your face.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.487
You're that killer!

12:19.196 --> 12:20.656
Shit!

12:21.490 --> 12:22.450
[grunts]

12:22.533 --> 12:24.118
Goddamn Betty!

12:24.201 --> 12:25.286

[upbeat music playing]

12:33.169 --> 12:35.004
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

12:37.006 --> 12:38.299
He's in for a surprise.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.427
[device beeping]

12:42.636 --> 12:43.929
[Jet] All right. Good news.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.807
Maybe Kimmie's birthday
won't be a total disaster after all.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.643
You'd settle for a partial disaster?

12:49.727 --> 12:51.896
Well, Chalmers will be there.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.148
With his smiley fucking face.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.235
Did I ever tell you that about him?
He's always smiling.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.489
You first meet the guy
and think he's had a stroke or something.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.824
Then you realize
he's just one happy asshole.

13:03.908 --> 13:07.203
-You guys were pretty close, huh?
-Yeah. Fought side by side.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.122
Saved each other's life once or twice.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.834
Homicide's a brotherhood.

-Ja, that's what I said. A hund.
-[man groans]

31:57.749 --> 32:00.335
[imitates dog barking]

32:00.418 --> 32:04.047
It's crazy, right? He must make a fortune
at the atmo farm to buy a hund.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.425
Yet he won't even pay for the pinky end

32:07.508 --> 32:11.012
of a double-sided dildo.
He's a cheap bastard.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.805
Yes, you keep saying that.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.182
Um…

32:14.265 --> 32:15.975
-Thank you for your time.
-[Greta] Mm.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.185
All right, thank you.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.228
[Greta] Uh-uh.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.189
Are you a cheap bastard?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.609
[sighs] Not by choice, Mistress.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.235
-[Greta moans]
-[Jet] Spike.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.987
-[Spike] Hmm?
-[Jet] Let's go.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.614
-Oh.
-Hey.

32:31.824 --> 32:32.825
Okay.

32:32.909 --> 32:33.743
Oh.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.579
-[grunts]
-[man imitates barking]

32:40.541 --> 32:42.585
Hey! Hey.

32:42.669 --> 32:46.047
Aren't you glad we didn't give up on this?
That dom was onto something, yeah?

32:46.130 --> 32:48.758
No shit she's onto something.
Check this out.

32:51.511 --> 32:55.390
It's not a B&amp;E-turned-murder.
Hakim was kidnapping their dogs.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.934
That's what these
rich people have in common.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.435
They all have dogs.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.273
Psycho kills 12 people
to steal their dogs. Well, that's…

33:05.066 --> 33:06.317
That's a first.

33:06.401 --> 33:09.654
-And a stupid play. I mean, dogs bark.
-Yeah.

33:10.571 --> 33:13.658
Where can you keep that many dogs
without someone noticing?

33:15.910 --> 33:19.622
The fine Mistress did say
Hakim has a job at the atmo farms.

33:34.470 --> 33:37.348
This is the only atmo farm
on Tharsis that isn't active.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.642
[Spike] Yeah, but why steal dogs?

33:39.726 --> 33:42.311
Those things are harder to move
on the black market than diamonds.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.355
Yeah, normally I'd give a shit
about motive and all,

33:44.439 --> 33:46.524
but right now, we're short on time.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.734
-What?
-Jet.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.695
A dog.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.197
Do you see that?

33:54.824 --> 33:57.410
Can't remember
the last time I saw a real dog.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.132
I think he wants us to follow him.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.069
-[man speaking indistinctly]
-[dogs barking]

34:35.281 --> 34:37.450
Nice to meet you. Thank you. Hello!

34:37.533 --> 34:40.119
Are you a good boy? Who's a good boy?

34:40.203 --> 34:45.249
Ein, what are you doing down there?
Hello. Good boy.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.959
What the hell are you doing?

34:47.043 --> 34:48.753
Put it down, Hakim.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.297
There's two of us and one of you.
You can't win.

34:52.381 --> 34:53.758
What's with all the dogs, anyway?

34:53.841 --> 34:56.094
Don't you know how hard
those things are to sell?

34:56.177 --> 34:57.178
Sell 'em?

34:58.262 --> 35:00.681
-I was gonna kill 'em.
-Why the hell would you do that?

35:00.765 --> 35:03.267
That's just it. I couldn't do it.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.520
It wasn't fair. They didn't do anything.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.815
-No shit, they're just dogs.
-Not to those rich assholes.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.691
To them, they're like kids.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.778
Yeah, yeah. Children are like dogs,
dogs are like children.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.114
Look, Hakim,
I've got a toy store to get to.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.533
My family worked for them.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.495
And when the Earth Gate blew,
they left us behind!

35:23.412 --> 35:26.499
They put their dogs
in escape pods instead of us.

35:26.582 --> 35:27.834
And my parents…

35:29.001 --> 35:29.919
They didn't make it.

35:30.503 --> 35:35.299
For years I've dreamed of paying
those entitled shitheels back.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.427
Of taking away the things that they loved!

35:39.971 --> 35:42.598
And I couldn't even do that right!

35:47.019 --> 35:49.230
It's like you said, they're just dogs.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.819
It's like… It's like being mad at water
for being wet.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.405
And they've got these adorable faces.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.367
I mean, they're so adorable.
They don't deserve to die.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.119
You're right, they don't.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.790
But I do.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.085
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
-Easy.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.795
My life is not worth living!

36:12.879 --> 36:16.257
Look, it's worth plenty.
Fifteen million woolongs to be exact.

36:16.883 --> 36:17.884
That's pretty good.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.054
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:23.097 --> 36:23.973
That's good?

36:24.056 --> 36:26.684
-Well, it's not our biggest haul ever--
-Spike.

36:26.767 --> 36:29.020
You're the biggest bounty
that we've ever seen.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.856
-Huge. Huge, Hakim.
-Huge.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.360
-Okay.
-All right.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.198
Okay, that's a good deal. And you guys…

36:40.823 --> 36:42.366
You guys get some kale

36:42.450 --> 36:45.494
and I go away
for the piece of shit that I am.

36:46.245 --> 36:48.122
Gotta do something about your self-esteem.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.290
Yeah, I know.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.625
[gunshot]

36:52.168 --> 36:53.711
-[sirens chirp]
-[Jet] Son of a bitch!

36:54.879 --> 36:55.880
What the hell?

36:59.175 --> 37:00.509
We had it under control!

37:00.593 --> 37:02.303
Oh, it didn't look like that to me.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.599
-Hakim here, well, he had a gun on you.
-Bullshit!

37:06.682 --> 37:09.644
Come on, this guy wasn't
a threat to anybody. You know that.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.897
You didn't want
to pay out the bounty, did you?

37:12.980 --> 37:14.815
Yeah. There's that too.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.610
Better luck next time, cow-spittle.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.572
-Hey, walrus 'stache!
-Forget it, Spike.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.658
That money was ours. That money was ours!

37:23.741 --> 37:24.951
Let's go. Let's go.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.787
I don't understand
how you can be so calm, man.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.122
-Let's go.
-[sighs] Hey.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.458
They stole our bounty,
which means you don't get your doll,

37:32.541 --> 37:35.086
which was the whole point
of this carnival of fuck-up-ery!

37:35.169 --> 37:37.088
Spike, if you shut your face
for 17 seconds,

37:37.171 --> 37:39.799
you'll see we're gonna end up
with something better than a doll.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.100
[engine revving]

37:49.684 --> 37:51.102
[brakes screech]

38:05.324 --> 38:07.159
[exclaiming playfully]

38:07.243 --> 38:08.327
[giggles]

38:16.252 --> 38:18.254
[chuckling]

38:18.337 --> 38:21.090
Hi, bean. Sorry I missed the party.

38:21.173 --> 38:22.383
Hi.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.136
Look at you.
I can't believe how big you've gotten.

38:25.219 --> 38:26.595
[chuckles softly]

38:26.679 --> 38:29.557
Happy birthday. I got you a present.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.434
Is it a Walking Sally doll?

38:31.517 --> 38:34.687
No, sweetie. It's something better.

38:36.897 --> 38:38.899
[upbeat music playing]

39:02.882 --> 39:06.969
[squealing]

39:08.554 --> 39:10.848
-[Kimmie] Does he have a name?
-[Jet] Uh-huh.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.184
[Kimmie] "E-I-N."

39:14.226 --> 39:15.102
Ein.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.021
That's right, baby. His name is Ein.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.357
I love him so much!

39:19.440 --> 39:20.649
[laughs]

39:21.192 --> 39:22.193
Jet.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.823
Hey, Alisa.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.117
[beeps]

39:30.201 --> 39:31.619
[phone rings]

39:32.578 --> 39:33.579
Moshi moshi.

39:33.662 --> 39:34.789
Hello, Vicious.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.339
[in English] Fearless.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.257
Look how cute he is.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.509
Pretty great, right?

39:46.592 --> 39:48.552
No, Jet. Not great.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.470
[barks]

39:49.553 --> 39:50.971
[Kimmie laughs]

39:51.639 --> 39:54.100
[Kimmie] Come back, Ein! Come here!

39:54.183 --> 39:55.142
[Alisa] A dog?

39:55.226 --> 39:57.978
You know what the taxes are
to keep a dog. I can't afford that.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.939
-I know, I'll… I'll chip in.
-Jet.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.942
I'm just trying to be a part of her life.
I mean, she deserves--

40:03.025 --> 40:05.820
She deserves to not fall in love
with something she can't keep.

40:07.947 --> 40:12.243
-So this is what a dead man sounds like.
-[Spike] That's right.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.870
And I'm giving you a chance
to keep it that way.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.706
You're giving me a chance?
How generous of you.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.875
I had decided to put a bullet in your head

40:19.959 --> 40:22.962
after you sent that assassin
to kill me on Venus, but…

40:24.296 --> 40:26.382
I had a change of heart.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.009
You're Vicious.

40:30.302 --> 40:31.512
It's who you are.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.723
It's like being mad at water
for being wet.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.727
You were in my business
and you had to be dealt with.

40:39.311 --> 40:42.356
That's how business works.
It's nothing personal.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.524
Or is it?

40:44.567 --> 40:45.526
Brother.

40:47.361 --> 40:51.824
Well, I'll be damned. Jet.
Didn't think you were going to make it.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.034
Here I am.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.204
Oh, hey, where, uh,
where did you get that dog?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.123
-What are you suggesting?
-[Alisa] All right.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.207
Stop.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.711
[Chalmers] Yeah.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.008
-Alisa, hear me out. He's a--
-No.

41:09.717 --> 41:10.801
Jet, no.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.679
Just go.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.891
And take that dog
back to wherever you found it.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.193
[Kimmie] Can I call him sometime?

41:29.445 --> 41:33.282
Ein. I mean, he's yours, right?

41:34.283 --> 41:35.576
Yeah, of course he is.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.037
And of course you can.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.039
Whenever you want. Okay, bean?

41:44.877 --> 41:46.962
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.508
-End this now.
-[Vicious] Or what?

41:51.091 --> 41:52.218
Or I end you.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.761
You're one man.

41:55.387 --> 41:58.432
I have the power
of the Syndicate behind me.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.935
I'm untouchable.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.479
I see you got yourself
a new set of wheels.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.776
You're still hiding behind
bulletproof glass?

42:15.032 --> 42:16.450
[gunshot]

42:16.534 --> 42:18.536
[dramatic music continues]

42:28.629 --> 42:29.463
[gasps]

42:50.526 --> 42:52.444
-He's on the silo.
-[Lin] Who?

42:53.654 --> 42:54.655
Fearless.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.199
[breathing heavily]

42:57.283 --> 43:01.328
Fearless!
