it's time for dinner,

Mr. Bobinsky
has invited you

to come see
the jumping mice
perform after dinner.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.549
Really?
That know-it-all Wybie

36:17.675 --> 36:19.676
said it was all
in Mr. B's head.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.969
I knew he was wrong.

right in this world, kiddo.

CORALINE: Hello!

36:41.574 --> 36:45.952
I thought you'd like him more
if he spoke a little less.
So I fixed him.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.164
So he can't talk at all?

36:49.290 --> 36:50.957
Nope.
Hmm.

36:51.584 --> 36:52.876
I like it.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.629
Now, run along,
you two, and have fun.

You're awful cheerful
considering you
can't say anything.

At least they'll
love my chapters.

I did not call
him crazy, Coraline.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.415

My other mother
would get them.

Maybe she should
buy all your clothes.

is in the other apartment?

you'd feel safer.

And cut your knee.

1:26:33.438 --> 1:26:36.064
Coraline, I asked you
to count all the windows,

1:26:36.149 --> 1:26:37.691
not put your knee
through them.

1:26:37.775 --> 1:26:38.859

1:27:13.811 --> 1:27:15.395
For the garden party?

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.981
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:27:18.066 --> 1:27:21.902

You still mad?

1:27:59.524 --> 1:28:03.360
I'm really sorry
I threw you at her,
the other mother.

1:28:04.570 --> 1:28:06.822
It was all I could think of.

1:28:20.837 --> 1:28:23.463

It's a fine, fine thing
you did for us, miss.

Well, I'm glad
it's finally over.

1:28:57.081 --> 1:29:00.500

1:29:04.756 --> 1:29:07.341
But how? I locked the door!

1:29:07.425 --> 1:29:09.009
It's the key, miss.

1:29:09.093 --> 1:29:11.386
