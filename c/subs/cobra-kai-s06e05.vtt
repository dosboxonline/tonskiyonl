WEBVTT

00:16.766 --> 00:19.811
Since the spread has stopped,
and it looks like it's regressing,

00:19.894 --> 00:23.565
I'm dropping your mother
to ten milligrams of Tamoxifen twice a day

00:23.648 --> 00:27.110
and starting her
on an 80 milligram IV of Doxorubicin.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.155
Are you sure she still needs all that?

00:30.822 --> 00:32.741
She's walking. She's laughing.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.952
Uh, she made me and my little brother
dinner the other night.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.664
I can't remember
the last time that she did that.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.084
Mm. She's headed in the right direction.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.795
Tapering off her dosage
makes sure it stays that way.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.674
You're doing a great job
taking care of your mom, Tory.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.842
Keep it up.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.373
Glad to see you're still training.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.169
What are you doing here?
Aren't the police looking for you?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.546
Oh, I'm not that easy to catch.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.216
I just came to check up on my champion.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.927
- How are you holding up?
- Oh, so now you care?

01:34.010 --> 01:37.055
Last time I saw you, I needed your help.
And you know what you said to me?

01:37.138 --> 01:40.600
The best thing you can do right now
is look after yourself.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.770
I went back for you.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.940
You left me to deal with Silver
and his psycho-bitch sidekick alone.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.192
You have every right to be angry.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.070
But I could not involve you in my plan

01:52.153 --> 01:54.989
to… liberate myself.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.741
I know it seemed cold.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.410
But I was only trying to protect you.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.747
And now that I'm out,
we have an opportunity to dominate--

02:02.831 --> 02:04.082
No. There is no "we."

02:07.335 --> 02:09.295
Oh, I see now.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.923
You know, I never thought
I'd see the day when

02:13.174 --> 02:15.426
the Queen Cobra would join the enemy.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.388
- They're my friends.
- Darling, don't be naive.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.850
They'll invite you in,
but you'll never belong there.

02:21.933 --> 02:26.020
When push comes to shove,
they'll always figure out a reason

02:26.813 --> 02:29.858
to keep you second fiddle
to LaRusso's kid.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.442
Go crawl back under your rock.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.737
I may not be calling the police,
but if my senseis see you, they will.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.615
<i>I </i>am your sensei,

02:38.575 --> 02:39.868
and you

02:40.577 --> 02:41.828
are my champion.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.039
I may be a champion,

02:45.790 --> 02:47.208
but I'm not yours.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.261
I heard Aisha got into UC Santa Cruz.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.181
- You heard anything from Stanford?
- No.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.851
I've been checking my emails,
like, every day, but nothing.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.644
Don't stress. It'll come.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.813
I mean, Demetri hasn't heard
from MIT yet, so…

03:08.897 --> 03:09.898
Yeah, I did.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.984
- I got in.
- What?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.486
Well, yeah. Why are you all so surprised?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.780
I worked my ass off and earned that spot.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.117
That would be like LeBron James
getting turned down by the Lakers.

03:21.826 --> 03:25.205
Congratulations, Demetri.
It's a really hard school to get into.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.123
Yeah, it certainly is.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.500
Especially when you don't apply.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.835
Right, Eli?

03:32.086 --> 03:33.046
Real subtle.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.341
Hey, man, I'm just saying you miss
100% of the shots you don't take.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.262
I still can't believe you told Kreese off.
I've never seen anybody do that before.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.388
He had it coming.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.684
Keep that between us. I don't want
anyone thinking I'm in contact with him.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.186
Yeah. I won't say a word.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.648
- I'm just happy that you're here.
- Yeah, well, this is all we have.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.901
Everyone else is worried about college,

03:54.984 --> 03:58.112
but for us,
this is our last chance to win big.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.991
Yeah, I mean,
you've already done something big.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.160
- You won the All Valley.
- Yeah? It doesn't count.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.162
Silver paid off the ref.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.374
It's still better
than always coming in second.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.416
Hey.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.961
This is bigger than the All Valley.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.505
It's gonna be televised
all over the world.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.924
If we win,
that's all anyone's gonna remember.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.759
It would be nice to stand on that podium.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.930
And side by side
for the entire world to see.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.101
Let's make a deal.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.855
No matter what, we stick together,

04:33.439 --> 04:34.857
and we win the Sekai Taikai.

04:35.942 --> 04:36.943
Just you and me.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.488
Yeah?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.996
All right. Circle up.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.542
Hey, ha-have you seen Kenny?

04:52.625 --> 04:58.464
- Uh, no. Not since the shittening.
- Probably still trying to clean his pants.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.759
The Sekai Taikai
needs our final roster in three days.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.053
And now that we know who's going,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.931
it's time for us to name
our male and female captains.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.392
The captains are not just
the leaders of the team.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.853
They're the ones
that will be fighting in the finals

05:11.936 --> 05:13.229
if we can make it that far.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.357
Plus, they get to fight on live TV.
Who knows what comes after that?

05:16.441 --> 05:20.528
Wheaties boxes, chop-socky flicks,
ZZ Top videos. Sky's the limit.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.697
You'll all get the glory if we win,

05:22.780 --> 05:25.283
but, yes, the captains
will be in the spotlight.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.870
They need to represent
the best that Miyagi-Do has to offer.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.497
And Sensei Lawrence and I
want to assure you

05:31.581 --> 05:35.293
that the decision
will be completely unbiased.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.837
That's right. In two days,

05:37.920 --> 05:40.465
Sam will face Tory
for the female captain spot,

05:40.548 --> 05:42.759
Robby and Miguel will fight
for male captain.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.553
We all know
you fought plenty of times before,

05:45.636 --> 05:47.180
but now that we're on the same side,

05:47.263 --> 05:50.850
this is still the best way for us
to see who's progressed the most.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.102
All right, enough talking.
It's time to train.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.064
You four, get inside.
I'm gonna whip your butts into shape.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.529
I thought I was
supposed to train them today.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.324
Ah, you go tomorrow.
Got some moves I wanna teach.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.326
Can you tell me that ahead of time?

06:08.409 --> 06:11.537
We gotta stay on the same page. Otherwise,
we're gonna be sending mixed messages.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.916
Don't get your panties in a bunch,
all right? We are on the same page.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.378
Look. Miyagi-Do, remember?
I even came up with my own kata.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.881
Big circle.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.009
Big circle.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.303
Breathe in.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.347
Breathe out.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.268
Elbow to the face. Punch to the throat.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.646
Lift his ass up.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.855
And dump him.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.274
The key to Miyagi-Do is balance.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.444
You gotta stay on your feet
no matter what life throws at you.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.659
<i>♪ The battle ain't… ♪</i>

06:49.742 --> 06:52.995
Mr. Miyagi fought for America.
You're gonna have to do the same.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.581
♪ <i>We'll never surrender… </i>♪

06:55.665 --> 06:57.291
<i>Foreign kids don't speak English.</i>

06:58.584 --> 06:59.669
<i>But they do speak karate.</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:01.170
Ais!

07:01.254 --> 07:03.798
- <i>Gonna have to kick higher.</i>
<i>- </i>Ais!

07:03.881 --> 07:06.217
<i>And harder… than ever before.</i>

07:06.300 --> 07:09.095
- The Soviet Union doesn't even exist any--
- Quiet!

07:09.178 --> 07:10.638
<i>♪ Raise the flag ♪</i>

07:11.597 --> 07:12.807
Good job, Nichols.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.059
That's it, Robby.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.147
Breathe and clear your minds.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.983
Focus. Open your eyes.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.486
Watch closely. Watch closely.
Here comes the good part right here.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.446
Right here.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.156
Hell yeah.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.366
Kick to the stomach. Block his attack.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.409
Grab his nuts.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.161
Twist, twist, twist.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.747
Alex Grady is the character he's playing.
Lost his shoulder in the first movie.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.083
In the second movie,
it's miraculously healed.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.752
If you believe in yourselves,
you could be like Eric Roberts too.

07:45.006 --> 07:45.965
Yes, Nichols!

07:46.674 --> 07:49.969
Dodge, not catch. Get up, Diaz.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.556
LaRusso, keep your feet.
Balance, balance! Come on!

07:54.599 --> 07:55.516
Sam!

07:56.893 --> 07:59.854
I'm at the end of my rope. First,
he goes behind my back with Barnes.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.149
Now he's shoehorning
his old macho crap into the lessons.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.402
He took over
the entire training session today.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.946
But isn't that where we're heading?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.283
You know, Johnny taking over
once you step aside.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.995
I mean, you said this tournament
was your karate swan song.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.872
Okay, I remember.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.459
I also remember Johnny saying
he was gonna fully embrace Miyagi-Do too.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.960
Well, he is, isn't he?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.087
In name only at this point.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.257
Ever since we found out
there's only six slots and two captains,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.801
all his worst impulses are rushing back.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.802
Trust me,

08:31.886 --> 08:35.181
Mr. Miyagi would not be happy
with this version of Johnny

08:35.264 --> 08:37.517
as the face of his family's karate,
I'll tell you that.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.978
Well, maybe you're right,
but how do you know?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.692
I mean, after what we learned
about Mr. Miyagi, anything is possible.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.237
Amanda, I don't care what's in that box.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.448
I know who Mr. Miyagi was,
and this is not what he would've wanted.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.201
Okay, I didn't mean to rile you up.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.163
I'm sorry.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.166
Just having a bad day.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.128
<i>Today was a great day</i>
<i>at Miyagi-Do.</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:09.131
Kids are tougher than they've ever been.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.259
- That's great.
- They're ready to fight the best.

09:11.342 --> 09:16.138
I just hope this fight doesn't create
a rift between Miguel and Robby, you know?

09:16.931 --> 09:17.932
They've come so far.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.518
Don't worry. They're all good.
I've been watching 'em.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.231
- Oh.
- What is it? What's wrong? You okay?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.316
Yeah.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.235
She's kicking.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.286
- Damn. Girl's got power.
- Yeah.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.289
- We should bring her to the tournament.
- Mm.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.167
- Oh, Miggy.
- Hey.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.669
What's wrong?

09:47.461 --> 09:49.880
- I got deferred.
- You got deferred? What's deferred?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.341
From Stanford. It means "not yes."

09:52.967 --> 09:55.761
But it's not a no either, right?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.598
They'll re-review your application
with the other kids in the spring.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.558
- You're still in the fight.
- Yeah.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.768
Doesn't matter how you start.
It's how you finish.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.687
Exactly. Oh!

10:11.902 --> 10:13.195
Well, thanks, Mrs. Parton.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.073
You sure it's okay
for Brandon to stay both nights?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.367
You're the best.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.204
Please make sure
he brushes his teeth. Okay.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.590
Mom, I'm home.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.968
Dr. Judith lowered all your prescriptions.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.928
She said you're doing so much better.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.228
No.

10:48.105 --> 10:48.939
Mom.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.566
Mom.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.860
Mom. Mom!

10:54.153 --> 10:55.446
Mom! Mom!

10:57.156 --> 10:58.324
Mom, wake up!

10:59.325 --> 11:00.534
Mom, please wake up.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.619
Wake up, Mom!

11:02.495 --> 11:04.955
Mom! Mom! Mom!

11:05.915 --> 11:07.708
Mom! Mom!

11:19.553 --> 11:21.389
I've been checking
Stanford's websites,

11:21.472 --> 11:23.599
and they only accept
15% of the people they defer.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.975
Fifteen!

11:25.059 --> 11:28.396
Anything you can do between now and April
is only gonna help your chances.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.189
Extracurriculars are huge.

11:30.272 --> 11:34.402
They didn't care about the All Valley. Why
would they care about the Sekai Taikai?

11:34.485 --> 11:35.528
Because it's international.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.782
It's one thing to be the best in town.
It's another to be the best in the world.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.326
Yeah.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.249
It just means
I'm gonna have to beat Robby again.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.584
Hey.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.714
Uh, have you guys seen Tory?
We're supposed to train at the park later.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.758
No, but I thought you were coming
to the dojo to train with us.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.094
Well, we figured
since we're fighting each other,

12:00.177 --> 12:02.221
it would be best
not to show each other our moves.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.848
Yeah, I mean, makes sense.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.560
You better watch out.
You're going down this time, El Serpiente.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.693
If they're training together,

12:16.318 --> 12:17.319
then so are we.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.699
LaRusso.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.994
You put me on the test drive schedule?
What the hell?

12:25.077 --> 12:27.163
You're always
on the test drive schedule Thursday.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.166
But the captains' tests are tomorrow.
I figured you'd get someone else.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.668
There is no one else.
Mendez went home sick.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.881
So get Louie to cover. You're just gonna
train the kids without me?

12:36.964 --> 12:40.634
Yeah, kind of like how you trained them
yesterday without me, right?

12:40.718 --> 12:43.637
I see what's going on. You're pissed
Nichols kicked ass in my lesson

12:43.721 --> 12:46.140
and Sam didn't,
so you're sidelining me to tip the scales.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.808
No, I'm not tipping anything.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.478
It's business, Johnny.
You just can't leave when you want.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.355
- Well, you're leaving.
- Well, it is my business.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.191
Someone's gotta train the kids.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.653
I'll run through exercises at the dojo.
Make sure they're ready for tomorrow.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.781
It'll be good.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.014
Tory.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.393
Tory?

13:34.396 --> 13:35.231
Tory.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.901
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.994
You said she was getting better.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.413
Your mom had a pulmonary embolism.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.041
We had no idea
she was developing a blood clot.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.835
And when it broke up--

13:57.920 --> 13:59.255
You should have caught it.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.466
Uh, you have every right to be upset.
You're grieving.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.886
Just try to remember
the last five years were a gift.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.513
Your mom was--

14:07.596 --> 14:08.472
I have to go.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.642
Is there anyone we can call?

14:13.310 --> 14:14.270
There's no one.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.156
Sensei, how am I doing?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.492
Your form is great.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.953
Just remember
to clear your mind and breathe.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.918
Kid's dialed in.
He really wants that male captain slot.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.712
It's his best shot at Stanford.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.838
What about you?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.923
We know Tory's gonna
give you a good fight.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.758
But what are you fighting for?

14:50.347 --> 14:51.223
Closure.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.644
Tory beat me at the All Valley,
but it was tainted.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.104
For both of us.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.939
I wanna prove how good I really am.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.941
To myself.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.276
Closure's good.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.778
It means the outcome isn't what matters.

15:04.862 --> 15:08.115
If you wanna find your closure,
you just have to give it your all.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.367
Just lay it out there.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.707
All right.

15:24.006 --> 15:24.965
Handles pretty well.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.009
Just give it some gas. Don't be a pussy.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.140
- Are we allowed to go this fast?
- Test drive. It doesn't count.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.852
The question you should be asking is,
"Can I beat every other car on the road?"

15:36.936 --> 15:40.147
- I assume it's got Bluetooth.
- It's got all the teeth you'll ever need.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.108
When you're driving
down Ventura Boulevard,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.110
all the babes are gonna drop their…

15:46.737 --> 15:47.947
Son of a bitch.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.411
Anti-lock brakes. Comes standard.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.627
Hup.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.212
Hup.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.047
Hup.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.261
Uh, you guys keep going, okay?
I'll… I'll be right back.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.763
Hup.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.810
- What the hell, man?
- What are you doing here?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.853
Basic training at the dojo, huh?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.689
You kept me at work
to get me out of the way.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.565
No. That was not the intent.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.651
Save it, all right. Some partnership.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.071
I don't have to defend how I train
these kids. I'm reviewing kata.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.531
Who's that?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.201
Ah hell!

16:35.536 --> 16:36.412
My test drive.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.666
- Don't change the subject.
- That is beyond unprofessional.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.836
Please go back to the car
and finish the test drive.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.589
I got a better idea. How about you finish
the test drive, and I'll train the kids.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.216
You've had your day of training, okay?

16:49.299 --> 16:51.468
And forcing a client
to hike through the woods

16:51.552 --> 16:55.139
so you could swear at your boss
is bad for business.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.223
So take him back.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.475
Now.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.477
You're the boss.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.188
Yeah, I am.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.068
Move it or lose it, dude. I'm driving.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.826
Attention, everyone!

17:17.202 --> 17:19.163
Can I have your attention, please?

17:19.246 --> 17:22.082
I'm leaving LaRusso Auto
to start my own dealership.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.753
So if you're like me and you're tired
of the way Daniel runs shit around here,

17:26.253 --> 17:28.714
we'll walk away right now.
No questions asked.

17:29.631 --> 17:30.716
Who's with me?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.217
Who is that guy?

17:33.218 --> 17:36.722
- Anoush, grab your shit. Let's go.
- I'm, uh… I'm on an important call.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.349
Yeah, I know, it's got a lot of torque.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.684
Johnny, get down.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.895
- Can we talk for a second?
- Louie.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.439
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.
What do you say?

17:45.522 --> 17:47.024
Ready to join Team Lawrence?

17:47.107 --> 17:50.944
Oh, I would, but it's family, man,
and I got a good thing going here.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.656
But just out of curiosity,
what kind of 401are you working with?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.075
Come on, let's go.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.826
Grab a bunch of cars
from the trade-in lot.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
Meet me at Art's Deli
to discuss your future.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.330
Okay, get… Just get in there.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.295
- Okay. What happened?
- Why don't you ask Daniel?

18:08.378 --> 18:12.299
I'm asking you because you're the one
pulling the dime store Jerry Maguire.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.177
Your damn husband has a bug
up his brown hole. That's one thing.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.472
Number two, I joined Miyagi-Do
thinking we were in this together,

18:18.555 --> 18:20.265
and meanwhile he's pushing me
out of the way.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.310
I'm sure he's not pushing you
out of the way. Daniel's just…

18:24.019 --> 18:27.564
He hasn't been himself lately.
He's… been going through something.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.109
You're finally leaving him, huh?

18:30.192 --> 18:34.196
Oh, damn. He's gonna shit when he
finds out you're working for me and Louie.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.698
I'm not leaving him.
And you're not quitting.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.536
But you are acting like an idiot.
So just cool your jets.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.746
And give Daniel some grace.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.084
He found this… old box of Mr. Miyagi's,

18:47.167 --> 18:50.045
and it just brought up
a lot of difficult emotions for him.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.005
Oh yeah?

18:54.341 --> 18:55.467
What was in the box?

19:04.101 --> 19:05.477
Ais! Ais!

19:11.150 --> 19:12.025
<i>Second place.</i>

19:12.109 --> 19:14.194
Ais! Ais! Ais! Ais!

19:15.988 --> 19:16.947
<i>Second place.</i>

19:17.030 --> 19:18.532
- Yeah!
- <i>Second place.</i>

19:18.615 --> 19:20.909
<i>Second place. Second. Second place.</i>

19:20.993 --> 19:22.077
<i>Second place.</i>

19:23.620 --> 19:24.830
<i>Second place.</i>

19:27.499 --> 19:28.834
Oh, you're still training.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.713
Yeah. What about you?
You get some work in?

19:32.796 --> 19:33.630
Ah, a little.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.467
Look, Robby, I just wanted to say

19:37.551 --> 19:40.304
no matter what happens on the mat,
I don't have any beef with you, okay?

19:40.888 --> 19:41.722
Yeah.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.015
I just really need this.

19:44.808 --> 19:45.642
And I don't?

19:46.268 --> 19:49.438
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just, uh…
I'm thinking about Stanford.

19:49.521 --> 19:53.066
They look at my application again, and
this could be really life-changing for me.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.778
So because I'm not going to college,
my life isn't worth changing?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.489
- That's--
- Hey, boys.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.869
I, um, made hamburgers.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.496
Thanks, Ms. Diaz. I'm not hungry.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.335
See you tomorrow.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.336
Yeah.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.512
<i>Tory.</i>

21:07.724 --> 21:08.600
Tory?

21:18.568 --> 21:19.987
What are you drawing, sweetie?

21:27.160 --> 21:27.995
Wow.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.290
Is that a queen and her princess?

21:31.373 --> 21:32.791
Mermaid princess.

21:32.874 --> 21:36.670
Oh, yeah, of course.
I can see her little tail right there.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.298
- And who is this?
- The prince.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.718
He's gonna fight
anyone who tries to hurt them.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.553
Well, it's beautiful.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.097
But why do they need
a prince to fight for them?

21:47.597 --> 21:49.891
How about the queen
and the mermaid princess

21:49.975 --> 21:51.476
learn to fight for themselves?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.021
But they don't know how.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.105
Well, not yet.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.732
<i>But maybe they can learn.</i>

21:57.524 --> 21:58.400
<i>Together.</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:00.235
<i>How does that sound?</i>

22:06.825 --> 22:07.826
It's okay, sweetie.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.911
Life dealt us a bad hand.

22:11.371 --> 22:14.374
But we can change that.
'Cause we're fighters now.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.265
Until we learn how,

22:30.766 --> 22:33.060
this magic jewel will protect you.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.398
<i>You're a pretty amazing little girl.</i>

22:41.818 --> 22:43.653
<i>And Mommy loves you so much.</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:11.181
Look, you have to find
a way of making this work.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.102
I tried, Amanda. I really did.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.312
If a guy can't work a shift
without undermining me,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.064
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.273
You're right.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.693
He was out of line at the dealership,

23:23.777 --> 23:27.155
but at the dojo,
you two are supposed to be partners.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.242
You could've given
Anoush or Louie the shift.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.036
Why not just include him in the training?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.038
I told you. He is--

23:35.122 --> 23:36.790
Not embracing Miyagi-Do. I get it.

23:36.873 --> 23:41.670
Look, far be it from me to tell you
anything about Mr. Miyagi's karate,

23:41.753 --> 23:44.881
but if there is one word
that I've heard a lot,

23:44.965 --> 23:46.299
it is "balance."

23:46.383 --> 23:48.760
It seems like
ever since you opened that box,

23:48.844 --> 23:51.012
you have been off balance.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.597
Yeah, I know.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.978
It was hard enough
not having Mr. Miyagi in my life anymore.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.855
The thing that bothers me now is

24:01.398 --> 24:03.400
knowing there was
a part of his life I didn't know.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.445
A part that he was keeping from me.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.574
I just have this… scary feeling
deep down in my heart

24:10.657 --> 24:12.409
that there's a reason why, and I'm…

24:14.494 --> 24:15.912
afraid to know what that is.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.207
Well, maybe it's a good thing
that you'll never know.

24:19.916 --> 24:24.796
That way, you can stop worrying
about the past and focus on the present.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.964
And right now,

24:26.548 --> 24:29.551
your students need you and Johnny.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.396
Hey.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.442
Just give it your all. Whether you win
or lose, I believe in you. Okay?

24:45.525 --> 24:46.359
Thank you.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.237
Hey.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.239
Just give it your all.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.201
Whether you win or lose,
I believe in you. Okay?

24:56.036 --> 24:58.455
Sensei Lawrence, a word, please?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.921
Hey, Johnny, listen. About yesterday--

25:06.004 --> 25:10.175
It's fine. I get it. You're the boss. And
I know you've been dealing with some shit.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.635
No, it's not fine, okay?

25:11.718 --> 25:15.722
I may be your boss at the dealership,
but I am your partner in karate.

25:16.306 --> 25:19.809
So, I was thinking,
what if I refereed Robby and Miguel?

25:19.893 --> 25:23.855
Keep you out of the middle of your boys.
And you ref Sam and Tory.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.107
Sounds fair.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.152
It's gonna be a rough day for these kids.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.571
We just need to be there for 'em.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.202
Hey, where's Tory?

25:38.328 --> 25:40.705
I don't know. I've been calling her.
She should be here.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.040
Oh.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.379
Miguel, Robby, you're up first.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.933
First to three points wins.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.104
Face each other. Bow.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.109
Fighting positions.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.736
- Ais!
- Ais!

26:13.280 --> 26:14.197
Ready?

26:15.365 --> 26:16.241
Fight.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.589
Point, Diaz.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.055
One point, Diaz.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.557
Zero points, Keene.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.434
Ready?

26:43.101 --> 26:43.935
Fight.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.206
Point, Diaz. Two points.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.336
One more, and he wins.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.890
That's two points to zero.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.396
Tory.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.316
It's 2-0. Diaz in the lead.

27:32.025 --> 27:32.859
Hey.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.653
Are you okay?

27:35.403 --> 27:37.906
Yeah. Just ready to fight.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.449
Ready?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.450
Ais!

27:41.076 --> 27:41.993
Fight.

27:50.627 --> 27:51.461
Ais!

27:53.004 --> 27:53.838
Ais!

28:07.394 --> 28:08.311
Ais!

28:10.313 --> 28:11.523
Point, Keene.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.067
Yeah! Nice!

28:20.740 --> 28:22.659
Two to one.

28:22.742 --> 28:23.910
Ready?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.289
Fight.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.225
Point, Keene.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.144
Don't worry, Miguel.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.312
No matter what happens,
everything's gonna be okay.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.815
No, I need this.

28:58.945 --> 28:59.988
All right.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.239
Two to two.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.241
Next point wins.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.452
Ready?

29:06.244 --> 29:07.078
Fight.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.133
Ais.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.881
Point. Winner.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.266
No hard feelings?

30:11.184 --> 30:12.060
No, man.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.399
Congratulations, Robby.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.193
Thanks, Mr. LaRusso.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.739
Your male captain.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.241
Robby Keene.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.035
Good job, Robby. Sorry, Miguel.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.546
Hey, you were a badass out there.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.714
Today just wasn't your day.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.551
Thanks, Sensei.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.180
- Hey.
- Sorry I was late.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.765
You came just in time.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.100
LaRusso, Nichols.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.395
You and me on the podium, right?

30:56.646 --> 30:57.605
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.651
Break a leg. Not literally. Don't…

31:09.242 --> 31:10.159
Bow to me.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.912
Bow to each other.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.166
May the best woman win.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.181
Fighting positions.

31:33.975 --> 31:37.729
<i>It's okay, sweetie.</i>
<i>Life dealt us a bad hand.</i>

31:38.855 --> 31:40.356
But we can change that.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.609
<i>'Cause we're fighters now.</i>

31:47.906 --> 31:49.449
Ready? Fight.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.541
Point, LaRusso.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.918
That's my girl.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.132
Fighting positions.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.259
Ready?

32:17.769 --> 32:18.728
Point, Nichols.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.367
Hey, Ref.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.702
That's a little overkill.
That should be no point.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.037
Yeah, yeah, I'm handling it.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.622
I'm… I'm fine. I'm fine.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.960
Listen, that's a warning.
Next one's a deduction.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.130
It's one to one. Fighting positions.

32:46.714 --> 32:47.548
Ready?

32:48.132 --> 32:48.967
Fight.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.232
Point, LaRusso.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.317
Two to one.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.117
Hello?

33:15.451 --> 33:16.995
Fighting positions.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.086
Ready?

33:26.170 --> 33:27.005
Fight.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.012
We need to stop the fight.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.457
The fight's over.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.835
That's not fair.
That could have been a point.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.588
What the hell? I'm the ref.
I'll decide when the fight's over.

34:08.671 --> 34:11.132
- I'll explain. I promise.
- Don't stop the fight. Please.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.968
- We can't do it in front of everybody.
- I'm fine, Dad. Really.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.679
No, Sam. It's not that. It's not that.
Come on. Please, girls.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.972
Off the deck. Let's go.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.932
Don't tell them what to do.
I'm their sensei too.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.768
Well, then, end the fight.

34:21.851 --> 34:22.894
Why?

34:23.478 --> 34:24.812
Because my mother died.

34:29.776 --> 34:30.651
Tory.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.612
I'm… I'm so sorry for your loss.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.489
But we can't continue this fight.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.158
- This is not the time.
- Yes, it is.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.868
Yes, it is.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.369
I have to fight now.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.871
No. Tory.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.039
I wanna fight, too,

34:43.122 --> 34:46.000
but this is not right.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.294
Sensei Lawrence, some help here, please.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.463
It's not up to us.

34:50.546 --> 34:52.673
- If Nichols wants to fight, she should.
- Johnny.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.344
We'll find another way
to appoint the captain.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.137
Find a way? No.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.556
No! You do not understand.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.642
None of you understand!

35:03.518 --> 35:04.852
My mom would have wanted this.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.145
If I don't fight…

35:06.729 --> 35:09.524
I have to do this.
I have to do this for her.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.443
- I have to fight.
- Tory, let's just take a second and--

35:12.527 --> 35:13.528
- Robby, no.
- Just breathe.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.696
Tory, I know what you're feeling, okay?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.449
I also know that you're not
in the right headspace to decide.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.576
- You don't want me to beat your daughter.
- No.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.079
When push comes to shove,
you're gonna choose her over me.

35:23.162 --> 35:26.082
- No, it's not that, Tory.
- Hey, we're not taking sides.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.209
- You sure about that?
- Johnny.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.338
You want this fight to be over?

35:33.005 --> 35:34.799
Fine. It's over.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.137
- Tory, where are you going?
- I'm done!

35:45.226 --> 35:47.520
Great work, LaRusso.
You just lost one of our best fighters.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.189
- Why the hell didn't you back me up?
- Because she wanted to fight!

35:50.273 --> 35:52.400
Her mother just died.
What's the matter with you?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.818
She was working through it!

35:54.569 --> 35:57.655
When my mom died, all I wanted to do
was get on a mat for three rounds.

35:57.738 --> 36:00.032
It would have helped me then.
It would have helped her now.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.201
We don't teach these kids
to fight with anger.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.495
That's… that's not the Miyagi-Do way.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.665
Oh, please.
I'm so sick of hearing that name.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.835
You act so high and mighty,
like Miyagi was some perfect angel.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.003
But he wasn't.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.131
I heard about
his dirty little box of secrets.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.925
Mr. Miyagi was a liar and a thief.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.928
Shit. Johnny, I…

36:22.305 --> 36:23.389
- I'm sorry.
- Quiet!

36:26.142 --> 36:29.020
I'm gonna coach the tournament with you.
For the kids.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.022
Not for you.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.648
Not for this dojo.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.025
For them.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.110
But once we win,

36:37.820 --> 36:38.863
you and I are done.

36:40.698 --> 36:41.574
For good.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.790
<i>Training for the Sekai Taikai</i>
<i>has been hard on all of us.</i>

36:50.291 --> 36:51.584
But now training is over.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.213
While most of you
won't be going to Barcelona,

36:56.214 --> 36:58.341
we know you'll be there with us in spirit.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.886
Since Tory
won't be going with us,

37:02.970 --> 37:04.931
we've decided Hawk will take her spot.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.694
You six
will be fighting for Miyagi-Do.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.906
It will be the toughest challenge
you've faced yet.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.993
And to win, we're all gonna need
to be there for each other.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.995
All of us.

37:28.871 --> 37:29.747
As a team.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.584
Captains, step forward.

37:36.879 --> 37:40.383
Chris, bring up the official
Sekai Taikai captain headbands.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.546
Dad, what's wrong?

38:35.771 --> 38:38.190
Mr. Miyagi fought in the Sekai Taikai?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.390
Let the games begin.
