<i>People once believed
that when someone dies...</i>

01:01.691 --> 01:05.194
<i>A crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.</i>

01:06.112 --> 01:09.490
<i>But sometimes,
something so bad happens...</i>

01:09.574 --> 01:12.076
<i>That a terrible sadness
is carried with it...</i>

01:12.160 --> 01:13.953
<i>And the soul can't rest.</i>

01:14.954 --> 01:17.874
<i>Then sometimes- just sometimes-</i>

01:17.957 --> 01:22.378
<i>the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.</i>

01:45.735 --> 01:47.487
I got one here!

02:12.887 --> 02:15.014
Hey, sarge.

02:15.098 --> 02:17.308
Yeah.

02:17.392 --> 02:21.938
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

02:22.021 --> 02:25.608
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

02:25.692 --> 02:27.276
Nobody.

02:29.862 --> 02:32.782
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

02:32.865 --> 02:35.118
All right, guys, let's do it.

02:35.201 --> 02:38.454
Devil's-fuckin'-night.
What's the count so far?

02:38.538 --> 02:39.872
143 fires.

02:39.956 --> 02:41.749
They're slacking off from last year.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.627
Three hours to go.
Maybe they're just slow starters.

02:44.711 --> 02:46.295
Corning through!

02:50.675 --> 02:54.012
I really empathize, but you guys just can't
come in here and take her away like this.

02:54.095 --> 02:55.555
There are procedures to stick by.

02:55.638 --> 02:58.224
You guys should have
cleared this with me first.

02:58.725 --> 03:01.144
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia earhart.

03:01.227 --> 03:02.979
We found her, detective,
and you missed it.

03:03.062 --> 03:06.858
I don't care what her name is.
I didn't give the order to move her.

03:06.941 --> 03:09.569
Jesus, Albrecht. I can see
why they took away your gold shield.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.738
I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.533
All right, clear outta here.

03:16.868 --> 03:19.162
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

03:21.664 --> 03:24.625
- Where's Eric?
-Just don't worry about him.

03:26.878 --> 03:28.963
Tell him to take care of Sarah.

03:29.047 --> 03:32.258
Look, I will.
You just lie back. Come on.

03:42.602 --> 03:44.937
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

03:45.021 --> 03:48.983
Look, your sister- she's gonna be okay.

03:49.067 --> 03:53.404
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

03:53.488 --> 03:54.906
She's my friend.

03:54.989 --> 03:56.991
Her and Eric.

03:59.368 --> 04:01.162
You lied to her about Eric.

04:01.245 --> 04:02.830
I had to.

04:03.664 --> 04:05.666
And you're lying to me about Shelly.

04:07.168 --> 04:09.087
She's gonna die, isn't she?

04:18.096 --> 04:20.223
Now, come on. Come on.

04:20.973 --> 04:22.600
Come on. Lt's okay.

04:25.978 --> 04:27.480
She's gonna be fine.

04:46.332 --> 04:50.253
<i>A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.</i>

04:50.962 --> 04:53.172
<i>I used to think that was true
about everything-</i>

04:53.256 --> 04:57.176
<i>families, friends, feelings.</i>

04:57.927 --> 05:01.681
<i>But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...</i>

05:01.764 --> 05:06.185
<i>Two people who are meant to be together-
nothing can keep them apart.</i>

05:33.838 --> 05:35.047
Later.

05:44.473 --> 05:46.392
What are you, like, the night watchman?

06:08.998 --> 06:14.462
You know, what this place needs
is a good natural catastrophe.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.924
Earthquake, tornado, you know.

06:18.007 --> 06:19.258
No, no, no, no. Mickey.

06:19.342 --> 06:22.303
Come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

06:22.386 --> 06:24.680
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.724
Hey, let me do it.

06:27.892 --> 06:31.938
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

06:33.439 --> 06:35.274
Don't cheap out on me.
Lots of onions.

06:35.358 --> 06:36.442
Here you go.

06:36.525 --> 06:38.903
There you go. All right.

06:38.986 --> 06:40.488
Now we're talkin'.

06:41.697 --> 06:44.700
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

06:46.244 --> 06:47.912
How do you steer that on a wet street?

06:47.995 --> 06:50.081
Pure talent. Hi.

06:50.164 --> 06:54.085
Sarah, she's a genuine “hot dogger.”
you hungry?

06:54.168 --> 06:55.962
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.

06:56.045 --> 06:58.214
No onions though, okay?

06:58.297 --> 06:59.757
No onions?

06:59.840 --> 07:01.425
They make you fart big time.

07:09.350 --> 07:12.019
You know, lake erie
actually caught on fire once...

07:12.103 --> 07:14.814
From all the crap
floating around in it.

07:15.982 --> 07:17.733
I wish I could have seen that.

08:19.837 --> 08:21.422
Fire it up!

09:03.589 --> 09:05.049
Fire it up!

09:05.132 --> 09:07.551
- We busted their machines!
- Boom!

09:30.491 --> 09:33.911
Oh, shit, guys.
T-bird, cop car. Cop car.

09:41.752 --> 09:43.754
Bad people out on the street tonight.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.388
- Damn it!
- What was that?

09:52.471 --> 09:53.472
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

09:54.473 --> 09:56.225
Mickey, call it in for me!

11:19.683 --> 11:21.018
Gabriel.

11:31.695 --> 11:33.531
Eric?

11:33.614 --> 11:34.782
Department of housing!

11:34.865 --> 11:36.951
Code violations?

11:37.034 --> 11:39.411
Safety hazards?

11:39.495 --> 11:41.664
Place looks fine to me.

11:41.747 --> 11:43.707
Let's redecorate.

11:48.254 --> 11:53.968
“Abashed, the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is...

11:54.051 --> 11:57.471
Saw virtue in her shape how lovely.”

11:57.555 --> 11:58.639
lt's pornography.

11:59.807 --> 12:01.475
<i>Virtue?</i>

12:04.895 --> 12:05.980
Shelly?

12:08.691 --> 12:09.984
See ya!

12:11.819 --> 12:13.946
No, me first.

12:16.907 --> 12:17.908
Please.

12:20.452 --> 12:22.246
- Shelly.
- Eric.

13:02.328 --> 13:03.704
That's good.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.670
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

13:13.005 --> 13:14.715
Look at that. Look at that.

13:16.091 --> 13:20.596
Here's to devil's night,
my new favorite holiday.

13:20.679 --> 13:22.181
To devil's night.

13:24.183 --> 13:26.185
You go over there and tell your pals-

13:27.561 --> 13:29.355
you sick fuck.

13:30.356 --> 13:33.150
You're out of your
motherfuckin' mind, man.

13:39.365 --> 13:40.741
Look at that!

13:42.368 --> 13:44.036
Pussies drink last, man.

13:45.871 --> 13:47.873
Fuck you, tin tin.

13:50.084 --> 13:52.586
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

13:52.670 --> 13:53.754
This one is.

13:54.880 --> 14:00.719
Which of you motor city motherfuckers
wants to bet me this one isn't?

14:02.304 --> 14:06.225
Hey! Fire it up! Fire it up!

14:13.816 --> 14:15.609
Here's your shooters.

14:15.693 --> 14:17.444
Put your guns away, huh, guys?

14:17.528 --> 14:19.238
How ya doin', pussycat?

14:41.301 --> 14:42.553
Boo.

14:52.855 --> 14:55.023
I love you.

14:55.107 --> 14:56.358
Say that again.

14:56.442 --> 14:57.609
I love you.

14:58.736 --> 15:00.279
Oh, boy.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.449
Restaurant.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.498
<i>Wow, you look great.</i>

15:16.420 --> 15:18.130
Yeah.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.926
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

17:00.941 --> 17:03.569
Couple more rings. That's 24k.

17:03.652 --> 17:05.654
24k, huh? Lt's 18k.

17:05.737 --> 17:07.656
It's crap. Lt's probably fake.

17:07.739 --> 17:10.075
Leather purse. Leather.

17:11.326 --> 17:13.453
Geez.

17:13.537 --> 17:16.330
What is this, tin tin-
a bloodstain that's on here?

17:19.417 --> 17:22.003
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

17:22.087 --> 17:24.923
Now, you take it or leave it.

17:26.049 --> 17:27.759
Right there for ya.

17:29.303 --> 17:31.847
Decisions, decisions. Yes, right.

17:33.765 --> 17:36.935
You cheap-ass, chrome-dome...

17:37.019 --> 17:40.981
Child-molestin', saprophyte motherfucker.

17:41.064 --> 17:42.441
Close the gate when you go out!

17:42.524 --> 17:45.152
I closes up for you real good, massa.

17:45.235 --> 17:46.945
Fuck you.

17:49.114 --> 17:51.283
Yeah, sit on it and twirl, you dirty scum.

17:55.996 --> 17:58.582
Lucky I don't stab your fat ass.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.899
What the fuck
you all painted up for, crackhead, huh?

19:53.071 --> 19:55.240
Halloween ain't till manana.

19:58.827 --> 19:59.911
Come on.

20:25.896 --> 20:28.482
I'll kill you! You better go!

20:38.116 --> 20:40.243
Fuck you, murderer!

20:40.952 --> 20:43.789
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

20:43.872 --> 20:45.332
What the fuck you want, man?

20:45.415 --> 20:47.876
I want you to tell me a story.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.170
A man and a woman
in aloft a year ago.

20:51.296 --> 20:53.924
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Listen!

20:54.007 --> 20:56.218
L'm sure you'll remember.

20:56.301 --> 20:58.970
You killed them on Halloween.

20:59.054 --> 21:01.056
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Halloween, yeah.

21:01.139 --> 21:03.725
Some dude, some bitch.
Whatever, man.

21:03.809 --> 21:05.644
Her name was Shelly.

21:06.436 --> 21:09.397
You cut her. You raped her.

21:09.481 --> 21:10.524
Shelly, yeah.

21:10.607 --> 21:14.486
I shanked her pink ass,
and she loved it!

21:24.579 --> 21:26.665
Murderer? Murderer?

21:26.748 --> 21:29.459
Let me tell you about murder.
Lt's fun!

21:29.543 --> 21:31.336
It's easy.

21:31.419 --> 21:34.172
You gonna learn all about it.

21:39.010 --> 21:41.471
I'd like you to meet two buddies of mine.

21:43.348 --> 21:45.183
We never miss.

21:54.234 --> 21:56.444
Try harder. Try again!

22:03.410 --> 22:06.329
Victims. Aren't we all?

22:18.258 --> 22:23.597
<i>Sometimes it rains inside my head</i>

22:23.680 --> 22:28.143
<i>when the words run dry</i>

22:28.226 --> 22:31.438
<i>the walls are breathing</i>

22:31.521 --> 22:34.482
look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?

22:34.566 --> 22:35.859
Yeah, it's a mess.

22:41.031 --> 22:43.116
<i>No, they don't have to take you</i>

22:43.200 --> 22:45.994
I gotta go upstairs.
Report from the front.

22:46.077 --> 22:50.624
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

22:50.707 --> 22:54.044
get out of my way, you worms!

22:55.587 --> 22:57.088
Give me some of that over there!

22:59.341 --> 23:02.844
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

23:02.928 --> 23:04.679
Hey, guess what.

23:04.763 --> 23:07.849
Arcade games fell down, went boom.

23:07.933 --> 23:09.059
Boom.

23:09.142 --> 23:11.770
Can you imagine that? Lt's tragic.

23:12.646 --> 23:16.816
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

23:16.900 --> 23:20.153
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

23:50.225 --> 23:51.643
You're thinking about the past.

23:56.898 --> 23:58.775
Dad gave me this.

23:58.858 --> 24:00.860
Fifth birthday.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.950
He said. “childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.”

24:21.673 --> 24:23.174
ls she asleep?

24:30.515 --> 24:32.267
I think we broke her.

24:37.689 --> 24:41.276
I love her eyes. Pretty.

24:45.572 --> 24:50.201
<i>No, they don't have to take you away</i>

24:57.709 --> 25:00.545
hey, kid, get the hell outta the road!

25:18.730 --> 25:20.065
Don't fuck with me.

25:23.568 --> 25:25.779
I told you to stay out of here.

25:25.862 --> 25:29.366
Sol guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

25:29.449 --> 25:31.368
She's busy.

25:31.451 --> 25:33.453
Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

25:33.536 --> 25:34.913
I don't have any dolls.

25:37.957 --> 25:39.292
Get some food, huh?

25:39.376 --> 25:42.420
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

25:48.009 --> 25:51.012
“Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.”

26:01.773 --> 26:05.026
thirty, forty dollars.

26:06.778 --> 26:09.197
Who the fuck is this now?

26:09.280 --> 26:13.451
Hey! Piss off! We're closed!

26:16.246 --> 26:20.125
Go sleep it off somewhere else, dust-head,
unless you want to get mutilated.

26:24.963 --> 26:27.215
L'm gonna blow this guy's dick off.

26:28.174 --> 26:31.177
Goddamn creatures of the night.
They never learn.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.181
Hey! Hey!

26:40.478 --> 26:45.525
“Suddenly I heard a tapping,
as if someone gently rapping...

26:45.608 --> 26:47.986
Rapping at my chamber door.”

26:50.029 --> 26:52.323
what are you talking about?

26:52.407 --> 26:55.034
You heard me rapping, right?

26:55.118 --> 26:59.289
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!

27:01.666 --> 27:04.669
L'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

27:04.752 --> 27:05.920
Gold.

27:06.004 --> 27:08.506
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

27:12.844 --> 27:16.598
Oh, shit. Oh, shit on me!

27:17.974 --> 27:20.518
Shit on me. Shit on me!

27:27.609 --> 27:29.903
Mr. Gideon. You're not paying attention.

27:35.116 --> 27:36.367
No! My hand!

27:37.952 --> 27:41.873
I repeat. A gold engagement ring, yes?

27:43.333 --> 27:46.836
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named tin tin.

27:50.757 --> 27:53.092
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

27:58.473 --> 28:00.308
Who's this sack of shit?

28:00.391 --> 28:03.520
That's tin tin,
one of t-bird's little helpers.

28:03.603 --> 28:06.648
I think you can rule out accidental death.

28:06.731 --> 28:09.526
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

28:09.609 --> 28:13.780
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

28:13.863 --> 28:18.576
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.578
L'm supposed to thank you for that, right?

28:20.662 --> 28:24.415
Word to the wise. Watch your fuckin' mouth.

28:25.625 --> 28:28.044
What the hell do you call that?

28:30.046 --> 28:31.673
I call it blood, detective.

28:31.756 --> 28:35.510
I suppose you'll write it up as graffiti.

28:35.593 --> 28:38.388
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

28:46.479 --> 28:48.022
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

28:48.106 --> 28:50.775
- Don't you know this game?
- What game are you talkin' about?

28:51.693 --> 28:53.695
Okay, I'll tell you about the rings!

28:53.778 --> 28:56.781
They're in that metal box!
Lt's under the shelf there!

28:58.866 --> 29:00.785
Take 'em! Take your fucking rings!

29:02.036 --> 29:03.788
And you can choke on them,
you son of a bitch!

29:07.375 --> 29:09.961
- Look, it goes up to the attic.
- Okay.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.806
No. No. No.

29:28.730 --> 29:31.024
It's beautiful. I don't believe it.

29:34.944 --> 29:36.321
<i>Shelly.</i>

29:45.496 --> 29:46.831
I love you.

29:54.922 --> 29:57.842
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

29:57.925 --> 29:59.344
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

30:02.305 --> 30:06.643
Now you're gonna tell me where to find
the rest of tin tin's little party pals.

30:06.726 --> 30:08.353
The pit. They all hang out at the pit.

30:08.436 --> 30:10.897
All of t-bird's little potato-heads
hang out there.

30:10.980 --> 30:14.275
Funboy- he lives there upstairs, all right?

30:14.359 --> 30:15.401
Funboy.

30:15.485 --> 30:17.362
Oh, baby.

30:19.197 --> 30:21.783
- A whole jolly club-
- stop! Please!

30:21.866 --> 30:24.035
With jolly pirate nicknames!

30:24.118 --> 30:26.746
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

30:28.456 --> 30:34.420
Each one of these is a life-
a life you helped destroy.

30:34.504 --> 30:37.090
L'm begging you. Don't kill me.

30:38.883 --> 30:41.010
L'm not gonna kill you.

30:41.094 --> 30:45.098
Your job will be to tell the rest of them
that death is coming for them-

30:45.181 --> 30:46.891
tonight.

30:53.815 --> 30:56.567
Tell them Eric Draven sends his regards.

30:59.904 --> 31:04.033
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

31:04.117 --> 31:05.785
You're nothing but street grease!
You hear that?

31:05.868 --> 31:08.246
Street grease, you motherfucker!

31:08.329 --> 31:09.872
Is that gasoline I smell?

31:09.956 --> 31:11.457
No, man, no!

31:32.103 --> 31:34.939
It's on the house, kiddo.
You know that.

31:35.648 --> 31:37.942
One root beer.

31:40.111 --> 31:42.655
I can't do anything.

31:42.739 --> 31:47.201
Your mom, technically, she's off right now.

31:47.285 --> 31:49.328
Yeah, way off.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.085
Police! Don't move!

31:56.169 --> 31:58.296
I said, “don't move!”

32:00.131 --> 32:02.008
I thought the police always said “freeze!”

32:02.091 --> 32:04.427
lam the police
and I say don't move, snow white.

32:04.510 --> 32:06.012
You move, you're dead.

32:07.638 --> 32:11.309
And I say I'm dead and I move.

32:12.185 --> 32:14.645
Not one more step. I'm serious.

32:14.729 --> 32:19.066
Then shoot, if you will, officer Albrecht.

32:19.150 --> 32:22.278
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

32:22.361 --> 32:24.071
You high?

32:24.155 --> 32:27.366
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

32:27.450 --> 32:31.412
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

32:31.496 --> 32:34.207
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

32:34.290 --> 32:37.752
I want you to move over to the curb.
Real nice and easy.

32:37.835 --> 32:38.836
Move it!

32:41.923 --> 32:43.591
We're gonna wait here for backup.

32:43.674 --> 32:45.676
It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.

32:47.094 --> 32:48.262
Oh, it gets better.

32:48.346 --> 32:50.848
Do you know someone named t-bird?

32:50.932 --> 32:54.143
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives.

32:54.227 --> 32:55.436
Like the coat?

32:55.520 --> 32:58.773
- You're the guy that murdered tin tin.
- Hey, check it out!

33:00.233 --> 33:01.692
He was already dead.

33:02.652 --> 33:05.363
He died a year ago-
the moment he touched her.

33:07.865 --> 33:10.868
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

33:12.203 --> 33:13.371
Get away from there!

33:13.454 --> 33:16.123
Cops! Get outta here!

33:17.875 --> 33:19.877
Leave it! Leave it! Run!

33:25.424 --> 33:28.511
Oh, great. Great.

33:29.804 --> 33:32.515
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

33:32.598 --> 33:34.976
And you lose him
right out in the open.

33:35.059 --> 33:39.939
Well, at least he didn't do that
“walking against the wind” shit.

33:40.022 --> 33:42.316
- I hate that.
- Little early for devil's night.

33:43.401 --> 33:44.735
What the hell is going on there?

33:46.320 --> 33:49.156
You are very restless.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.326
Just wish I was a little hungry again.
That's all.

33:52.410 --> 33:54.078
Be careful of what you ask for.

33:54.161 --> 33:56.038
Yeah, you may get it. I know.

34:08.050 --> 34:11.137
There are energies aligning against you.

34:11.219 --> 34:13.681
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

34:25.775 --> 34:27.485
Yummy.

34:32.867 --> 34:36.746
Gideon's pawn shop just burned down
to the foundation.

34:36.829 --> 34:39.290
Nobody cleared this little event with me.

34:39.373 --> 34:41.958
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

34:42.043 --> 34:44.670
- L'm sure you must be awful disappointed.
- I got trouble.

34:44.754 --> 34:48.090
One of my crew got himself perished.

34:48.174 --> 34:50.467
- Who might that be?
- Tin tin.

34:50.551 --> 34:55.097
Somebody stuck his blades in all
his major organs in alphabetical order.

34:55.181 --> 34:58.517
Gentlemen, I think we ought to have
an introspective moment of silence...

34:58.601 --> 35:01.020
For poor old tin tin.

35:03.981 --> 35:06.233
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

35:06.317 --> 35:09.111
- Whatever you say. I can do.
- Good.

35:09.195 --> 35:11.280
That's very reassuring.

35:11.364 --> 35:14.951
I still ain't heard the story
on why Gideon's burned down.

35:16.160 --> 35:20.665
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of god or something?

35:21.499 --> 35:23.376
Call it my need to know.

35:55.324 --> 35:57.493
Hey! Let me go, you creep!

36:03.916 --> 36:07.211
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

36:09.672 --> 36:12.008
- He couldn't have stopped.
- He was a butt-face.

36:12.091 --> 36:13.718
I could have made it.

36:15.636 --> 36:17.722
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

36:19.140 --> 36:20.599
Sometimes.

36:22.727 --> 36:24.854
It's more like surfing than skating.

36:24.937 --> 36:27.398
I wish the rain would stop,just once.

36:28.566 --> 36:30.026
It can't rain all the time.

36:30.109 --> 36:32.069
Eric?

36:49.045 --> 36:53.632
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

36:53.716 --> 36:56.177
Double homicide a year ago.

36:56.260 --> 36:58.095
No convictions.

36:58.179 --> 37:01.599
Annie, look at that.

37:02.600 --> 37:06.937
“We, the undersigned tenants
of 1929 caulderon court apartments”-

37:07.021 --> 37:08.522
what is this, a petition?

37:08.606 --> 37:10.941
A big “kick me” sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

37:11.025 --> 37:12.526
The cause got her killed.

37:12.610 --> 37:15.112
She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

37:15.196 --> 37:21.077
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.705
The last time you snooping on a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

37:24.789 --> 37:28.793
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

37:36.759 --> 37:39.512
You're gonna wind up
working a school crosswalk.

37:39.595 --> 37:41.722
L'm cool.

37:41.806 --> 37:45.935
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

37:47.603 --> 37:49.105
I owe you one.

37:49.188 --> 37:51.190
Yeah, right.

37:51.273 --> 37:53.484
Damn.

38:18.884 --> 38:22.596
Tomorrow night we can get high...

38:22.680 --> 38:26.308
And watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

38:51.834 --> 38:54.044
There's a big fuckin' bird over there.

38:58.382 --> 38:59.383
It's a squab.

39:01.385 --> 39:04.972
Come here, bird.
Hey, bird. Hey, bird.

39:05.055 --> 39:07.391
Bird. Birdie.

39:07.474 --> 39:10.060
Here, birdie, birdie.

39:10.144 --> 39:13.105
Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie.

39:19.069 --> 39:21.655
Here, funboy.

39:23.949 --> 39:25.910
What the fuck?

39:32.333 --> 39:36.754
Man, don't do that!
You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack!

39:36.837 --> 39:39.089
Look at the guy.

39:39.173 --> 39:40.758
Don't sweat it.

39:43.719 --> 39:46.764
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

39:55.648 --> 39:59.485
Take your shot, funboy.
You got me dead bang.

40:01.528 --> 40:06.450
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

40:06.533 --> 40:10.079
You need professional help.

40:12.873 --> 40:14.333
Bingo!

40:14.416 --> 40:17.127
He shoots! He scores!

40:27.263 --> 40:29.932
Jesus Christ!

40:30.015 --> 40:33.769
Jesus Christ?
Stop me if you heard this one.

40:33.852 --> 40:36.105
Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.

40:42.194 --> 40:44.989
He hands the innkeeper
three nails, and he asks-

40:46.198 --> 40:48.575
don't you ever fuckin' die?

40:48.659 --> 40:50.494
“Can you put me up for the night?”

40:56.417 --> 41:01.005
- does that hurt?
- Fuck, yes, it fuckin' hurts!

41:02.006 --> 41:03.173
Oh, god.

41:03.924 --> 41:07.303
Look what you've done to my sheets.

41:31.535 --> 41:33.537
L've got a gun in my pocket.

41:36.373 --> 41:39.251
You're happy to see me, aren't you?

41:57.061 --> 42:00.898
Stay away! Stay away from me!

42:08.781 --> 42:10.366
Look.

42:12.576 --> 42:17.122
“Mother” is the name for god
on the lips and hearts of all children.

42:17.206 --> 42:21.960
Do you understand?
Morphine is bad for you.

42:33.597 --> 42:37.184
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

43:09.216 --> 43:12.970
If l wanted ice, I would have asked for ice!
Now fill it up!

43:15.389 --> 43:17.433
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

43:17.516 --> 43:19.184
I really need this.

43:27.401 --> 43:28.694
All right.

43:30.696 --> 43:32.698
You burn yourself playing with matches?

43:32.781 --> 43:35.367
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

43:35.451 --> 43:37.911
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

43:37.995 --> 43:40.914
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

43:40.998 --> 43:43.834
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

43:45.627 --> 43:48.839
- Hey, hon!
- Good night, Darla.

43:52.718 --> 43:56.388
You stay put right there.

44:05.772 --> 44:07.983
Get away, steam-head.

44:40.474 --> 44:44.019
<i>You can see I'm here on the corner
of 27th street and east Washington place...</i>

44:44.102 --> 44:47.397
<i>The site of last year's
biggest devil's night conflagration.</i>

44:47.481 --> 44:49.650
<i>It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...</i>

44:49.733 --> 44:53.362
<i>Across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.</i>

44:53.445 --> 44:56.073
<i>The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...</i>

44:56.156 --> 44:58.200
<i>And cost the lives of two firefighters.</i>

44:58.909 --> 45:03.163
<i>In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police precinct-</i>

45:03.247 --> 45:05.791
freeze!

45:05.874 --> 45:08.293
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

45:10.128 --> 45:11.588
Fuck.

45:14.508 --> 45:15.759
Good likeness.

45:15.842 --> 45:19.555
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

45:20.722 --> 45:21.890
You still have your hat on.

45:25.769 --> 45:27.896
I gotta sit down.

45:30.691 --> 45:32.484
Holy shit.

45:34.987 --> 45:36.405
<i>Say...</i>

45:37.739 --> 45:41.994
Are you some kind of... ghost?

45:42.077 --> 45:42.911
Boo.

45:51.628 --> 45:53.547
I don't know what I am.

45:53.630 --> 45:56.174
I need you to tell me what happened to us.

45:58.260 --> 46:02.264
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

46:02.347 --> 46:05.434
She was beaten and raped.

46:05.517 --> 46:10.105
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

46:10.188 --> 46:12.608
Come on. Read the file.

46:12.691 --> 46:17.237
Shelly Webster held on for 30 hours
in intensive care.

46:17.321 --> 46:20.365
Her body finally just gave it up.

46:20.449 --> 46:23.327
I saw it. I couldn't do Jack for her.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.298
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

46:43.388 --> 46:44.556
You okay?

46:44.640 --> 46:46.558
I saw her.

46:49.019 --> 46:52.189
I saw her through your eyes.

46:52.272 --> 46:54.441
You stayed with her the whole time.

46:54.524 --> 46:58.695
Well, you gotta understand
something, all right?

47:00.030 --> 47:04.785
I was hoping she'd come out of it,
you know...

47:04.868 --> 47:07.788
Give me something I could work with.

47:07.871 --> 47:09.456
Yeah.

47:11.333 --> 47:12.584
Look, i-

47:12.668 --> 47:15.170
why didn't you do something about it?

47:15.253 --> 47:18.548
You think any of those people in that building-
even the ones who signed the petition-

47:18.632 --> 47:20.384
would talk after what happened to you?

47:22.177 --> 47:24.346
I kept asking questions...

47:25.555 --> 47:28.183
And finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

47:32.229 --> 47:34.106
This your wife?

47:34.189 --> 47:38.735
Yeah, we- well, not anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

47:40.529 --> 47:41.738
It's funny.

47:43.532 --> 47:47.244
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

47:47.327 --> 47:49.663
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

47:49.746 --> 47:53.041
Believe me, nothing is trivial.

48:03.719 --> 48:08.306
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

48:13.395 --> 48:16.231
Are you gonna vanish
into thin air again?

48:20.277 --> 48:22.571
I thought I'd use your front door.

48:25.574 --> 48:27.075
Look, man...

48:28.660 --> 48:31.455
I'm sorry as hell for what happened
to you and your girlfriend.

48:32.956 --> 48:34.332
Yeah.

48:40.964 --> 48:42.340
Yeah.

48:43.467 --> 48:46.386
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

48:46.470 --> 48:49.222
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

48:49.306 --> 48:52.392
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

48:52.476 --> 48:55.479
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

48:55.562 --> 48:58.273
I saw him too. He had a guitar.

48:58.356 --> 49:02.778
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

49:02.861 --> 49:06.531
He winked at ya? Musicians.

49:07.991 --> 49:09.493
What else did you see?

49:09.576 --> 49:12.496
So far I haven't heard shit about what
you're gonna do about all this crap!

49:12.579 --> 49:17.375
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed away and went swirling.

49:19.669 --> 49:21.421
You ain't lost everything.

49:21.505 --> 49:26.635
Yeah? And maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Jesus!

49:27.511 --> 49:30.305
Fair enough. Catch.

49:32.599 --> 49:33.809
Jesus.

49:33.892 --> 49:36.311
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

49:36.394 --> 49:38.230
Are you tellin' me this thing is real?

49:38.313 --> 49:41.983
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

49:42.067 --> 49:46.154
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

49:46.238 --> 49:50.367
You're directly out of your fucking mind!
You know that?

49:52.369 --> 49:55.288
Yeah. Eyes see.

49:55.372 --> 49:58.333
It's one of the most important things
i learned from my sister.

49:58.416 --> 50:00.043
Sister? She's supposed to be your sister?

50:01.753 --> 50:05.090
My father's daughter. That's right.

50:05.173 --> 50:06.883
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

50:08.677 --> 50:10.679
Now, let's take it from the top, friend.

50:10.762 --> 50:14.182
With a lot of detail. What do you say?

50:14.266 --> 50:17.811
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

50:17.894 --> 50:21.314
He told me to tell t-bird
that death was on its way.

50:21.398 --> 50:23.608
Whatever the fuck that means.

50:24.526 --> 50:27.445
Draven. He said his name was Eric Draven.

50:28.530 --> 50:30.615
You wanna relax that thing now?

50:30.699 --> 50:35.370
This bird man, he just happened
to let you live, huh?

50:35.453 --> 50:39.666
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

50:39.749 --> 50:42.544
I ain't makin' all this up.

50:42.627 --> 50:45.797
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

50:48.967 --> 50:51.094
All right.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.267
A boy and his bird.

50:58.810 --> 51:00.770
Awful touching.

51:11.031 --> 51:13.992
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

51:20.957 --> 51:21.958
Thanks.

51:23.335 --> 51:25.629
Funboy said he saw a black bird too.

51:25.712 --> 51:28.089
A big one.

51:28.173 --> 51:30.508
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

51:32.177 --> 51:34.930
<i>L'll have thejanitor come on up.</i>

52:39.494 --> 52:43.707
You again. Are you lost or hungry?

52:43.790 --> 52:45.417
Hi.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.839
<i>It can't rain all the time</i>

52:50.922 --> 52:52.924
<i>can't rain all the time</i>

53:04.561 --> 53:07.272
I mean, how many times I gotta tell you?
We're in this together, or we ain't!

53:07.355 --> 53:09.357
If one part falls, it all falls!

53:11.109 --> 53:13.778
You know how long it took us
to put this together.

53:13.862 --> 53:16.448
Then that piece of rat shit made tin tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll!

53:16.531 --> 53:18.241
Tin tin was a dick.

53:19.034 --> 53:20.535
Tin tin.

53:21.745 --> 53:25.957
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

53:26.041 --> 53:27.917
Fire it up!

53:31.755 --> 53:33.506
No funboy.

53:33.590 --> 53:36.593
Probably still bangin' away on Darla.

53:41.973 --> 53:45.060
Smokes and road beers. Be quick.

53:45.143 --> 53:47.145
L'm on it.

54:18.259 --> 54:21.429
What the fuck
are you supposed to be, man?

54:23.223 --> 54:25.350
L'm your passenger.

54:33.441 --> 54:35.151
Drive.

54:40.240 --> 54:42.033
What's all this happy horseshit?

54:43.034 --> 54:45.245
Hey, t-bird! T-bird!

54:49.666 --> 54:52.919
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

54:53.002 --> 54:57.006
Stupid ass-hair! You hit my car!

55:03.972 --> 55:08.393
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

55:10.019 --> 55:12.897
We could use you.
You did tin tin.

55:12.981 --> 55:16.067
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

55:19.028 --> 55:20.864
You got that cream stuff?

55:23.283 --> 55:25.702
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

55:27.287 --> 55:29.247
What in the crap-

55:33.751 --> 55:36.462
oh, look. Makin' us popular.

55:36.546 --> 55:39.382
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

55:44.929 --> 55:47.849
<i>This is vehicle 48.
We got us a big old red hot rod.</i>

55:50.435 --> 55:52.604
Turn.

55:53.938 --> 55:56.691
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

55:56.774 --> 55:57.942
Right?

56:03.239 --> 56:05.200
Damn! Dead end!

56:10.580 --> 56:12.040
Look out!

56:16.336 --> 56:17.962
Dumb ass! Get outta the way!

56:30.808 --> 56:33.937
Holy shit! Goddamn foreign cars!

56:38.775 --> 56:40.109
Shit! Shit!

56:48.785 --> 56:50.912
I hate this. This ain't good.

56:52.330 --> 56:55.833
T-bird! I got you, man!

56:55.917 --> 56:57.126
Shit!

57:12.058 --> 57:13.393
Remember? Yeah.
I remember everything.

57:13.476 --> 57:15.812
But I don't know- what? What?

57:17.063 --> 57:19.065
What? What are you talkin' about?

57:19.148 --> 57:20.400
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

57:20.483 --> 57:23.403
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

57:23.486 --> 57:25.488
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

57:25.571 --> 57:28.866
She wasn't going along
with our tenant relocation program.

57:28.950 --> 57:32.412
Then her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear...

57:32.495 --> 57:34.872
Into a total cluster fuck!

57:34.956 --> 57:37.792
Who gives a shit?
Lt's ancient history!

57:37.875 --> 57:41.212
What? What do you want?
What is it? What?

57:41.296 --> 57:44.340
Speak to me! Speak!

57:45.925 --> 57:47.844
Did you send us these complaints?

57:49.512 --> 57:52.807
Come here!
“abashed, the devil stood”-

57:52.890 --> 57:55.310
does it get you sweaty?

57:56.019 --> 58:00.732
I know you. I know you.
I knew I knew you.

58:00.815 --> 58:04.652
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

58:04.736 --> 58:07.280
You can't be you.
We put you through the window.

58:07.363 --> 58:09.157
There ain't no coming back.

58:09.240 --> 58:12.410
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

58:12.493 --> 58:14.746
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

58:19.375 --> 58:22.378
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

58:29.177 --> 58:32.472
“Abashed, the devil stood...

58:32.555 --> 58:35.433
And felt how awful goodness is.”

58:35.516 --> 58:38.519
“and felt how awful goodness is.”

58:40.980 --> 58:41.939
“and felt”-

58:53.659 --> 58:55.119
t-bird!

59:45.461 --> 59:47.755
<i>This is the 7:00 A.M. edition of action news.</i>

59:47.839 --> 59:50.216
<i>For over a decade,
the night before Halloween...</i>

59:50.299 --> 59:54.595
<i>Has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city- “devil's night”...</i>

59:54.679 --> 59:58.141
<i>The name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.</i>

59:58.224 --> 01:00:03.563
<i>Last year, 200 individual blazes were reported,

01:00:03.646 --> 01:00:08.776
<i>Tonight, we'ii be keying on what may become

<i>The mayor has firefighters

01:00:12.572 --> 01:00:16.367
do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:21.122
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:24.000
Wait, you loved eggs.

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:26.627
Yeah, when I was five.

01:00:26.711 --> 01:00:30.339
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

01:00:30.423 --> 01:00:33.801
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

01:00:34.719 --> 01:00:38.931
It wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:40.516
Who?

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.812
It was nuts.

01:00:45.813 --> 01:00:50.067
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:56.866
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

01:00:57.909 --> 01:00:59.202
Over easy.

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:05.416
I like 'em over easy, morn.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:18.304
Hey, Albrecht.

01:01:22.183 --> 01:01:24.810
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:27.813
We just fished this out of the river.
He was fused to his own car.

01:01:27.897 --> 01:01:30.149
We're gonna have to ID his teeth.

01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:33.319
His name is t-bird.
Arson was his specialty.

01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:36.155
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

01:01:36.239 --> 01:01:40.660
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.

01:01:40.743 --> 01:01:42.370
Come here.

01:01:46.749 --> 01:01:48.251
You're holding out on me.

01:01:49.627 --> 01:01:52.338
I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:55.216
And you're covering up for somebody.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:57.635
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

01:01:57.718 --> 01:02:00.596
You're the detective.
Why don't you tell me?

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.724
Okay. Gideon's blows to hell, and you're
having a chitchat with some weirdo...

01:02:03.808 --> 01:02:06.769
Who winds up in t-bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

01:02:06.852 --> 01:02:09.397
Then you steal
one of my case files from homicide...

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.816
And you're saying this is just
a fuckin' automobile accident?

01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:14.569
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

01:02:14.652 --> 01:02:16.279
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:18.364
You gotta write that shit down.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.324
All right, smart-ass.

01:02:20.408 --> 01:02:23.452
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

01:02:23.536 --> 01:02:26.372
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your suspension.

01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:28.833
Suspension? For what?

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:31.294
Misconduct.

01:02:33.629 --> 01:02:35.298
Yeah, give me the lab.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.435
<i>One for sorrow, two for joy...</i>

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:31.646
<i>Three for a girl, four for a boy.</i>

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:45.493
<i>You know how most people talk a lot
and never say a word?</i>

01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:13.229
Eric?

01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:19.235
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

01:04:21.028 --> 01:04:22.196
Gabriel.

01:04:23.948 --> 01:04:26.784
I thought you were dead.

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:28.869
You're not dead, are you?

01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:56.939
I knew it was you.

01:04:59.734 --> 01:05:01.736
Even with the makeup.

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:09.827
I remembered your song.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.539
You said,
“can't rain all the time.”

01:05:13.622 --> 01:05:15.750
that is from your song, right?

01:05:27.428 --> 01:05:29.930
Come on, Eric.
I know you're here.

01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:35.603
I miss you and Shelly.

01:05:39.982 --> 01:05:42.860
Gets so lonely all by myself.

01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:49.366
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

01:05:50.493 --> 01:05:53.162
Sarah, I do care.

01:06:03.714 --> 01:06:05.925
That's him. That's him!

01:06:06.008 --> 01:06:09.386
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.723
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

01:06:12.807 --> 01:06:15.309
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:18.229
And he flash-fried t-bird
to his fuckin' car!

01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:21.774
T-bird! Here's to you, buddy.

01:06:21.857 --> 01:06:25.861
Maybe we oughta just videotape this,
play it back in slow motion.

01:06:27.404 --> 01:06:31.742
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:33.077
Empty-

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:36.372
grave? What grave?

01:06:36.455 --> 01:06:40.084
- What about my fuckin' grave?
- Three out of four.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:43.420
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

01:06:43.504 --> 01:06:46.131
It's not fair. Lt's funboy's fault.

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:49.426
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he said...

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.763
“Waste them both.” and now this ghost
gonna kill my ass next!

01:06:57.268 --> 01:07:00.020
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

01:07:01.021 --> 01:07:03.232
- This ghost gonna kill-
- hey!

01:07:03.816 --> 01:07:05.776
It ain't no ghost.

01:07:07.695 --> 01:07:09.446
They have all arrived.

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.908
Watch him. We might need him.

01:07:14.577 --> 01:07:16.871
Ghost gonna kill my-

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:31.969
he like his plain or with onions?

01:07:34.305 --> 01:07:37.474
Fine. Don't talk to me.

01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:40.644
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

01:07:42.104 --> 01:07:44.356
That's what I thought.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.692
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?

01:07:46.775 --> 01:07:49.320
You'll just think I'm nuts.

01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:51.447
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

01:07:53.282 --> 01:07:55.576
You see him too?

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:58.162
I saw somebody.

01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:00.998
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.169
Eric didn't come back for me.

01:08:05.252 --> 01:08:09.590
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.468
You want a friend to walk you home?

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:05.729
<i>You things, things
things of the flesh</i>

01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:08.482
<i>do it slow</i>

01:09:08.564 --> 01:09:12.861
<i>down avenues, cut me</i>

01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:16.615
<i>lust in my eyes</i>

01:09:16.698 --> 01:09:19.660
<i>licking lips encouraging</i>

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:23.580
<i>Mr. careworn</i>

01:09:23.663 --> 01:09:29.127
<i>to gaze upon the screen, mask on</i>

01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:31.337
<i>after the flesh</i>

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.522
<i>boys.</i>

01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:53.484
It seems our friend t-bird
won't be joining us this evening...

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.613
On account of a slight case of death.

01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:58.699
You wanna sit down?

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:06.123
Well, well, well.
Devil's night is upon us again.

01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:08.167
I thought we'd throw a little party...

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:11.545
Start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:13.797
I like the pretty lights.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.679
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

01:10:20.763 --> 01:10:22.389
That's no reason to quit.

01:10:22.473 --> 01:10:25.976
Wrong. Best reason to quit.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.437
Only reason to quit.

01:10:29.772 --> 01:10:32.608
A man has an idea.

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:37.863
The idea attracts others...
Like-minded.

01:10:39.114 --> 01:10:44.453
The idea expands.
The idea becomes an institution.

01:10:45.746 --> 01:10:47.164
What was the idea?

01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:51.001
That's what's been bothering me, boys.

01:10:51.085 --> 01:10:53.879
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:56.465
It'd put a big old smile on my face.

01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:00.052
You see, gentlemen...

01:11:00.135 --> 01:11:03.263
Greed is for amateurs.

01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:09.895
Disorder, chaos, anarchy-

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:11.688
now that's fun!

01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:14.691
- What about devil's night?
- What about it?

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:18.195
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:21.323
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shit-heel was imitating me.

01:11:21.406 --> 01:11:24.827
Do you know what they got now?

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.996
Devil's night greeting cards.

01:11:29.665 --> 01:11:32.251
Isn't that precious?

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:33.961
Yeah.

01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:39.383
The idea has become
the institution, boys.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.260
Time to move along.

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:43.762
You don't want us to do “light my fire” time
for the whole city?

01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:46.306
No.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.727
I want you to set a fire so goddamn big,
the gods will notice us again.

01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:53.438
That's what I'm saying.
I want all you boys...

01:11:53.522 --> 01:11:56.900
To be able to look me straight
in the eye one more time and say...

01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.611
“Are we having fun or what?”

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:03.532
hey, you! What's your name?
Skank, you don't feel that?

01:12:03.615 --> 01:12:05.534
I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.

01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:09.496
“L feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.”

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.876
well, boy, your mama
must be damn proud of you!

01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:19.006
How the hell did
that thing get in here?

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:21.717
Gentlemen.

01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:27.598
There he is! Let me go!
Let me go! I gotta go!

01:12:32.853 --> 01:12:35.939
You're him, huh? The avenger.

01:12:36.023 --> 01:12:38.483
The killer of killers.

01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:41.445
Nice outfit.

01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:43.572
L'm not sure about the face though.

01:12:44.573 --> 01:12:46.950
L just want him.

01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:49.161
Well, you can't have him.

01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:50.871
<i>Well...</i>

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.460
I see you have made your decision.

01:12:58.086 --> 01:13:00.005
Now let's see you enforce it.

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:03.759
This is already
boring the shit out of me. Kill him!

01:13:11.308 --> 01:13:13.602
That had to hurt.

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.438
Well, that's that.

01:13:17.648 --> 01:13:19.733
That guy was crazy.

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:28.116
He's gone.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.334
Get him!

01:13:56.853 --> 01:13:59.064
Help me! He's gonna kill me!

01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:03.986
Jesus Christ!

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:57.205
You're all going to die.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.930
Get the fuck outta here!

01:15:50.842 --> 01:15:53.762
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, skank?

01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:58.141
L'm not skank.
There's skank right there.

01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:00.977
- Skank''s dead.
- That's right.

01:16:09.736 --> 01:16:11.238
What in the crap-

01:16:12.531 --> 01:16:15.158
- freeze!
- Hold it!

01:16:15.242 --> 01:16:18.662
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:30.632
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

01:16:34.094 --> 01:16:36.012
Stop running immediately.

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.639
Holy shit!

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:50.318
Repeat. Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs.

01:17:33.528 --> 01:17:35.530
Come on! Move it!

01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:43.079
My advice? Next time, duck.

01:17:45.123 --> 01:17:47.501
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away doughnuts.

01:17:50.962 --> 01:17:52.547
Shit!

01:17:58.011 --> 01:17:59.846
I knew you were gonna do that.

01:18:01.097 --> 01:18:05.393
Look at that out there.
The whole city oughta be in flames by now.

01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:08.647
Sky oughta be red.

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:13.068
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:18.823
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:20.784
I like him already.

01:18:20.867 --> 01:18:23.828
The crow is his link...

01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:26.456
Between the land of the living...

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.833
And the realm of the dead.

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:33.463
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:01.658
L'm coming home, Shelly.

01:19:49.706 --> 01:19:54.252
You're gonna say I shouldn't be in the cemetery
in the middle of the night, right?

01:19:54.336 --> 01:19:56.880
Safest place in the world to be.

01:19:56.963 --> 01:20:00.967
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

01:20:02.677 --> 01:20:05.180
It's really late, Sarah.

01:20:05.263 --> 01:20:07.974
You didn't say good-bye.

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:10.685
You're just gonna have
to forgive me for that.

01:20:12.187 --> 01:20:14.189
And you're never coming back.

01:20:23.031 --> 01:20:26.034
I gave this to Shelly once.

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:32.707
I think she'd like you to have it.

01:20:36.711 --> 01:20:39.005
This way, you'll always remember her.

01:20:39.839 --> 01:20:41.675
I'll never take it off.

01:21:00.985 --> 01:21:03.613
I better go sneak back in the house.

01:21:10.286 --> 01:21:11.746
Bye.

01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:38.815
Take it easy, sweetheart.

01:21:46.072 --> 01:21:48.283
Come on. Come on.

01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:05.633
What is that? Some sort of
souvenir there from your pal?

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.346
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say?

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:20.148
Her eyes are so innocent.

01:22:32.118 --> 01:22:33.369
Eric!

01:22:33.453 --> 01:22:34.954
Eric, help!

01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:20.291
Quick impression for ya.

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:23.837
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.257
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.

01:23:29.509 --> 01:23:33.263
Well, well. Why don't you just give me
a minute to think about that, huh?

01:23:42.897 --> 01:23:44.524
Nah, fuck it.

01:23:53.908 --> 01:23:55.076
Aw, fuck.

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:04.043
Well, well, well.

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:06.838
It does seem to me that
our little life has undergone...

01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:09.382
A rather significant change
in the past few minutes now.

01:24:09.465 --> 01:24:10.800
Wouldn't you agree?

01:24:15.096 --> 01:24:18.558
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

01:24:22.061 --> 01:24:24.314
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:27.901
Bye-bye, birdie.

01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:51.466
It's mine.

01:25:14.072 --> 01:25:15.406
Shit.

01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:19.619
Well,just came by to pay my respects,
and here you are getting all shot up again.

01:25:19.702 --> 01:25:22.288
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:23.915
Two more.

01:25:24.999 --> 01:25:26.417
I can handle it. Don't worry.

01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:29.379
L'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

01:25:29.462 --> 01:25:31.923
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

01:25:32.006 --> 01:25:35.677
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

01:25:38.346 --> 01:25:41.849
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

01:25:41.933 --> 01:25:43.977
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:47.522
I was. I'm not anymore.

01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:51.818
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

01:25:51.901 --> 01:25:52.902
Come on.

01:25:57.907 --> 01:25:59.534
You take that.

01:26:29.605 --> 01:26:31.190
You were supposed to stay behind me.

01:26:31.274 --> 01:26:33.067
I think I messed up.

01:26:57.175 --> 01:27:00.720
This is all the power you ever had.

01:27:00.803 --> 01:27:02.597
Now it is mine.

01:27:03.389 --> 01:27:07.477
Pity there's not more time...

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.103
For us.

01:27:27.246 --> 01:27:30.083
Help, Eric! I'm scared!

01:27:32.835 --> 01:27:34.462
Let me go!

01:27:44.472 --> 01:27:46.015
Let her go!

01:27:48.935 --> 01:27:52.021
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

01:27:53.606 --> 01:27:55.525
- All right.
- No!

01:29:03.384 --> 01:29:05.011
Sarah?

01:29:05.094 --> 01:29:06.053
Look out!

01:29:11.934 --> 01:29:13.102
Eric!

01:29:21.444 --> 01:29:25.823
You know, my daddy used to say,
“every man's got a devil...

01:29:25.907 --> 01:29:28.075
And you can't rest
till you find him.”

01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:30.703
what happened back there
with you and your girlfriend-

01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:34.040
I cleared that building.

01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:37.627
Hell, nothing in this town happens
without my say-so.

01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:39.962
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

01:29:41.088 --> 01:29:44.008
But if it's any consolation to you...

01:29:44.091 --> 01:29:46.552
You have put a smile on my face.

01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:49.263
You got a lot of spirit, son.

01:29:50.264 --> 01:29:52.558
Lam gonna miss you.

01:29:52.642 --> 01:29:54.518
I have something to give you.

01:29:54.602 --> 01:29:57.063
I don't want it anymore.

01:30:01.484 --> 01:30:03.444
Thirty hours of pain!

01:30:06.864 --> 01:30:08.574
All at once!

01:30:11.452 --> 01:30:13.454
All for you.

01:30:48.614 --> 01:30:50.199
Go help him.

01:30:54.495 --> 01:30:56.706
Are you alive?

01:31:00.668 --> 01:31:02.712
God, I need a cigarette.

01:31:08.676 --> 01:31:10.720
Everybody else dead?

01:31:10.803 --> 01:31:13.264
You helped me.

01:31:13.347 --> 01:31:15.599
What you kept in here saved me.

01:31:15.683 --> 01:31:18.811
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

01:31:18.894 --> 01:31:20.896
L've been meaning
to come to church anyway.

01:31:26.902 --> 01:31:28.529
Oh, yuck.

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:34.744
L'm quitting as of now- if I live.

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:46.630
Stay with him until help comes.

01:31:46.714 --> 01:31:50.217
He'll be okay, right?

01:31:51.177 --> 01:31:52.511
Eric?

01:31:55.556 --> 01:31:57.558
He does that a lot.

01:32:14.158 --> 01:32:15.659
Shelly.

01:32:28.464 --> 01:32:33.302
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicide.

01:32:34.553 --> 01:32:37.515
- At least it stopped raining, huh?
- It can't rain all the time.

01:32:37.598 --> 01:32:40.976
I don't believe it.
This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:44.730
Look, you go on home.
I'm okay.

01:32:44.814 --> 01:32:48.275
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

01:32:50.486 --> 01:32:51.737
You missed it.

01:32:52.571 --> 01:32:54.490
Get him outta here!

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.806
Thanks.

01:34:06.479 --> 01:34:09.482
<i>If the people we love
are stolen from us...</i>

01:34:09.565 --> 01:34:14.153
<i>The way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.</i>

01:34:14.236 --> 01:34:19.533
<i>Buildings burn, people die,
