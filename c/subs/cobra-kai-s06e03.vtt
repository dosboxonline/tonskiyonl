00:14.014 --> 00:17.767
<i>♪ Sweet baby, that's my baby ♪</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:20.770
<i>♪ He's about as sweet as it gets ♪</i>

00:22.313 --> 00:26.484
You better hope for a boy.
Raising girls is a nightmare.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.486
Wow. Thanks, Mama.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.780
Here. Let me help you.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.990
Oh, thanks.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.951
I don't think
I'm ever gonna get used to that.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.203
Better than trying
to tear each other's faces off.

00:37.287 --> 00:41.916
Anthony, get down here!
That little shit ate every last cannoli.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.295
Sorry, Amanda-san. Had midnight snack.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.838
You ate a dozen cannolis?

00:46.921 --> 00:50.175
They were mini.
Very small. Uh, bite-sized.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.634
Yeah, I know what mini is.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.263
You know, just…
take this to the living room.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.558
Feel free to keep walking from there.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.561
The guy flies in for the weekend
to kill Terry Silver,

01:01.644 --> 01:03.063
stays for another three months.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.439
That's normal, right?

01:07.275 --> 01:09.069
Hey. Hey, those are for the party.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.028
It's just one.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.780
Since when do you drink just one?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.908
You hoping for a boy or a girl?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.743
Ah, either way, I'm good.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.788
Took me a bit, but I'm a pro with boys,
and girls are easy.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.207
I wouldn't be
so sure about that, Johnny.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.833
Whatever. Chicks dig me.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.251
Good luck.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.213
Who's 30 minutes early?

01:39.307 --> 01:40.225
Who was it?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.018
Nobody there. Just this.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.021
Wait. You hear that?

01:46.856 --> 01:48.441
Is it… ticking?

01:51.486 --> 01:52.320
Kreese.

01:53.279 --> 01:57.117
Come on. You think Kreese would walk
into a FedEx Kinko's with a bomb?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.202
He did let a live cobra loose
in your dealership.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.454
I heard you never caught the damn thing.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.998
The wrangler said that was prob--
That's not the point.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.794
What about Silver? I can see him
pulling a Unabomber move like this.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.296
Don't move it!
It could have a dead man's switch.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.049
Remember Murtaugh on the crapper
in <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>?

02:13.133 --> 02:17.220
The key is staying completely
and totally… still.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.600
I have rearranged pastries.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.894
Tray is now balanced.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.611
The package came early.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.490
- Guess it's a girl.
- I can't wait to meet her.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.952
And for her to meet her dad.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.370
It's a girl!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.748
- Ow.
- I'm a girl dad. You're a girl brother.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.376
Where's Daniel?

02:48.459 --> 02:49.711
Oh, yeah, uh…

02:57.927 --> 02:59.512
I told him not to move.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.016
I'm too old for this shit.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.519


03:06.603 --> 03:08.271


03:08.354 --> 03:11.733
My students' abilities
far exceed what you had in America.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.694
Our training here is more intense.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.155
- More precise.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.490
- And more demanding.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.413
What do you call that combo?

03:25.496 --> 03:27.040


03:28.791 --> 03:29.792
Viper attack.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.631
It is designed to penetrate
even the most advanced defense.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.717
And when executed correctly,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.094
it will leave
the opponent's head vulnerable.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.139
Yoon Do-Jin.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.851
His family has trained
in our <i>dojang </i>for generations.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.897
He wears the <i>geum baeji</i>
because he is our best student.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.732
Whatever you ask of Yoon,

03:53.900 --> 03:55.735
he will execute to perfection.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.946
Impressive.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.282


04:12.835 --> 04:13.753


04:16.965 --> 04:18.174


04:18.800 --> 04:22.011
That's how you do it!

04:22.095 --> 04:25.265
Kwon Jae-Sung!
You did not follow the lesson.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.307


04:27.308 --> 04:28.851
It's a waste of time.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.229
Just go straight for head.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.189
No head, no fight.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.524
No shortcuts.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.276
And for your defiance,

04:36.359 --> 04:38.278
you will have a new assignment.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.948
Whatever it is, I can do.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.825
I am sure you can.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.245
Go and clean my grandfather's toilet.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.913


04:49.539 --> 04:50.790


04:51.291 --> 04:52.417
Back to work!

04:55.253 --> 04:57.588


04:57.672 --> 04:59.465

Kwon has always been a troublemaker.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.386
His rebelliousness is a distraction.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.724
A team is only as strong
as its best fighter.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.394
Master Kim has challenged me
to bring out the best.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.605
I will handle your distraction.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.945


05:24.741 --> 05:27.744
All right, all right. You got
the kata down. Let's see you use it.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.038
Fighting positions.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.624
Ready?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.335
Fight!

05:35.418 --> 05:36.836


05:43.468 --> 05:44.677
Come on, fight.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.138


05:47.221 --> 05:50.183
What is this, Ice Capades?
That's enough. Fighting stance.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.144
- Twenty-five reverse punches. Ready?
Yes, Sensei.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.729
- Begin.
Hai!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.023
Your girlfriends are broken.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.816
What the hell did you guys do?

05:59.692 --> 06:02.070
We didn't do anything.
They're just friends now.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.447
Yeah, they went from war
to Cold War to peace.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.908
Yeah, piece of crap fighting.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.659
Hai! Hai!

06:09.619 --> 06:12.872
Sensei, I get that Miyagi-Do
is about avoiding conflict,

06:12.955 --> 06:15.625
but if they're not gonna go hard
during training,

06:15.708 --> 06:18.294
how are they gonna lead us to victory
at the tournament?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.046
They're not.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.590
They're gonna get their asses kicked.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.218
All right, tomorrow's the big day, boys.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.804
Finally gonna find out
which country's hosting the Sekai Taikai.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.515
Germany would be cool. My dad's
getting stationed there next month.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.682
Oh, sick.

06:31.766 --> 06:35.269
My money's on Taiwan.
Gonna get my Din Tai Fung on.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.855
- There's a Din Tai Fung in Glendale.
Word?

06:37.939 --> 06:39.524
Hai! Hai!

06:41.943 --> 06:44.695
Love the smell of karate in the afternoon.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.614
- I think that's pond scum.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.866
- Hey.
Hey.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.411
Your daughter's a pussy now.
So is Nichols.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.913
Last I checked, Miyagi-Do doesn't mean
fighting like girls.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.958
- You know what I'm saying.
- Sure.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.877
- I thought you said girls were easy.
- They are.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.587
Okay, then, girl dad.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.381
Work your magic.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.969
This should go well.

07:09.887 --> 07:14.183
Lee. Call your dad. Tell him
you're having people over tonight.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.814
I wish you could see this, Mr. Miyagi.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.776
A whole dojo
full of kids learning your lessons.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.989
Need new mattress.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.867
Tempur-Pedic. Very comfy.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.035
Almost finished?

07:33.119 --> 07:37.707
Yeah. Still feels weird
to box up Mr. Miyagi's stuff, but

07:39.167 --> 07:41.461
if anyone's gonna move in,
I'm glad it's Chozen.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.088
Uh, cellular signal not good.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.009
Uh, did Miyagi-san
run fiber optic Internet?

07:48.092 --> 07:51.095
It's a little rustic, sure,
but it's just temporary

07:51.179 --> 07:53.389
till you go back to Okinawa
after the tournament, right?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.600
Uh, not going back to Okinawa.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.729
Come. Help me move bed.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.773
Okay. Go.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.445
What's that?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.889
This belonged to Miyagi-san?

08:35.973 --> 08:39.435
It must be his. He… he built the place.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.447
I'm sure you are all curious
to who our visitor is.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.076
Sensei Kreese is one
of the strongest senseis

08:55.159 --> 08:56.827
to ever train at this <i>dojang</i>.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.996
He brings an invitation

08:59.080 --> 09:03.251
for us to test our strength
against the best fighters in the world.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.296
You will give him
your full respect and attention.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
Is that understood?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.466
Yes, Sensei!

09:13.469 --> 09:15.763
A long time ago, I had a student.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.809
I trained him to be the best of the best.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.272
He dominated every opponent he ever faced.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.651
He was destined
to become a world champion.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.989
And then, one day…

09:35.032 --> 09:36.117
it all changed.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.369
He lost

09:39.120 --> 09:42.665
to an insignificant, scrawny little runt

09:44.500 --> 09:46.586
with maybe six weeks of training.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.255
And why did he lose?

09:50.047 --> 09:52.550
Because this opponent had more heart.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.471
So, class…

10:00.641 --> 10:04.645
how do we defeat
an opponent who has more heart?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.189
- More practice, Sensei.
- No.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.400
- More offense, Sensei.
- Wrong.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.820
Have heart yourself, Sensei.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.201
Or kill their heart
with strong kick to ribs.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.370
You do not speak!

10:30.046 --> 10:31.172
Kwon, is it?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.217
It seems you don't take me seriously.

10:38.429 --> 10:43.643
Perhaps… I need to show you
just how serious I am.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.569
Does Devon have a home dojo?

10:54.403 --> 10:56.572
No idea. But I am wearing waterproof shoes

10:56.656 --> 10:59.533
in case Johnny throws us
in a creek or quicksand.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.244
You made it.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.538
We're in the basement.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.421
Welcome to Miyagi-Do After Dark.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.592
- I don't think you should call it that.
- Miyagi-Do Nights?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.551
No.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.178
Dark Nights?

11:19.261 --> 11:21.430
Wait. Is this a slumber party?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.476
I've never had one before.

11:26.268 --> 11:30.064
I didn't know what color nail polish
you guys like, so I just got them all.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.401
Since you two are friends now,
we can have a girls' night.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.779
- With you?
- Hell yeah. I'm a girl dad now.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.031
I brought cookies
and tampons and everything.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.950
Come on inside. Grab a sleeping bag.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.743
The Mr. T one's mine.

11:46.831 --> 11:51.377
Sensei, this isn't me complaining,
and I know you love a good theme, but

11:52.837 --> 11:56.757
I'm not sure how a sleepover
is gonna help them get their edge back.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.468
Their friendship's caused them
to lose the eye of the tiger.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.720
They need conflict.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.930
I used to hear about
Ali's slumber parties.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.849
Nonstop drama.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.228
Put a bunch of high-school girls
in a basement, mix in a little gossip,

12:09.979 --> 12:12.606
pretty soon you got something
that makes <i>Scarface </i>look like <i>Bambi</i>.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.569
Mr. Miyagi kept this hidden,

12:16.652 --> 12:19.280
so opening it
would be an invasion of privacy. Right?

12:19.780 --> 12:22.408
Are you kidding? We have to open it.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.202
The curiosity might actually kill me.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.246
Sometimes better not to have answer.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.583
Right now, anything is still possible.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.169
If we open, we face truth.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.005
Guys, this is Mr. Miyagi
we're talking about.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.340
Possibly the greatest man who ever lived.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.218
How could you not wanna open
his buried treasure?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.816
Mr. Miyagi was a boxer?

12:57.651 --> 12:58.486
From China.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.823
There must be some amazing stories
behind all of this stuff.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.659
Well, May 3rd, 1947.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.747
"Police are searching for the culprit
in a violent robbery and assault."

13:09.830 --> 13:12.416
"Jim Watkins of Lodi was hospitalized

13:12.500 --> 13:15.586
after a severe beating
and the theft of a valuable necklace."

13:15.669 --> 13:19.423
"He identified his attacker
as Keisuke Miyagi."

13:19.507 --> 13:21.175
Keisuke Miyagi?

13:21.258 --> 13:22.676
Miyagi-san had brother?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.346
Not that I know of.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.682
Look.

13:28.766 --> 13:29.892
That's Mr. Miyagi,

13:30.559 --> 13:31.644
but the name is wrong.

13:31.727 --> 13:36.148
And he was born in 1924, not 1918.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.943
My mom says she's 71, but she's really 73.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.153
People lie about their age all the time.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.073
691 Hill Street.

13:44.615 --> 13:49.453
If Mr. Miyagi did live there,
maybe we can go find some answers.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.837
- Are your lungs bursting yet?
- Yes, Sensei!

13:57.920 --> 14:00.673
Good. You can thank Mr. Kwon for that.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.717
I do not wish to question your methods,

14:03.801 --> 14:07.221
but is it really worth
wasting an entire day of training

14:07.304 --> 14:08.639
just to punish Kwon?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.307
This is not a punishment.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.351
It is a lesson.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.270
And they all will learn.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.029
We're tired
of your disrespect.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.992
You want my respect? Earn it.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.703
We are here to train.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.915
I will teach you to keep your mouth shut.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.715
I have nothing to learn from you.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.757
Oh.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.052
Have it your way.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.350
That's enough for today.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.186
Come back tomorrow at sunrise.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.069
You said you would
bring out the best in my students,

15:04.153 --> 15:06.405
that you could handle Kwon's distractions.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.824
And now my top student is distracted.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.702
Only through pain

15:12.745 --> 15:14.830
does a champion reveal himself.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.710
<i>Who's ready to have some fun?</i>

15:26.717 --> 15:28.427
Ready? Fight.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.180
♪ <i>I come home in the morning light </i>♪

15:31.263 --> 15:35.517

15:43.275 --> 15:47.947
<i>♪ Oh, girls just wanna have fun… ♪</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:52.201
Will Mitch ever win the All Valley?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.119
- Who the hell's Mitch?
- Penis Breath.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.080

16:06.924 --> 16:10.761
Does Tory want Sam
to fall down a flight of stairs,

16:10.844 --> 16:13.389
breaking every single bone
in her little body?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.431
What?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.058
Well, let's see what it says.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.561
<i>♪ Some fun ♪</i>

16:19.645 --> 16:21.355
<i>♪ When the working… ♪</i>

16:21.438 --> 16:23.273

<i>♪ Oh, girls, they wanna have fun ♪</i>

16:27.152 --> 16:32.491
<i>♪ Oh, girls just wanna have fun… ♪</i>

16:33.742 --> 16:37.287
If Sam could describe Tory in one word,

16:37.371 --> 16:38.998
what would that word be?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.917
<i>♪ They just wanna… ♪</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:44.461

16:46.672 --> 16:48.298

16:49.174 --> 16:50.968
What? It could've said "bitching."

16:51.051 --> 16:55.514
<i>♪ Just wanna have fun ♪</i>

16:55.597 --> 16:57.433
I feel like an old-time PI.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.728
- Wish I had a fedora.
- I have trench coat.

17:01.228 --> 17:05.190
All we have is an address
on a fake ID from, like, 70 years ago.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.026
No one around here is gonna know anything.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.237
Internet said this business
has been around since the 1940s.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.407
If there's anyone alive
who might be able to explain all this,

17:13.490 --> 17:14.950
it's worth the tank of gas.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.745
Unless Miyagi-san buried secrets
for a reason.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.832
Would it help if I said we could get
sandwiches at Philippe's when we're done?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.292
Oh, that is big help.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.963
Spot. Take your fist.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.507
Nice.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.973
Hey, we're looking for the owner.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.141
Fuck off.

17:39.975 --> 17:40.851
Awesome.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.894
Friendly place.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.189
I go get answers.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.861
You know, I don't think it was
such a good idea bringing him along.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.906
He's been such a wild card
since Kumiko didn't call him back.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.117
Based on the welcoming committee,
maybe it's good that we have a wild card.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.331
Hey, excuse me.

18:02.414 --> 18:07.044
Listen, I know I have the right address,
but we figured if anyone knew anything…

18:11.715 --> 18:14.134
Oi, Daniel-san, we have runner. Let's go.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.096
Wh-wh-why are we chasing? Chozen?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.642
Yeah, this one's my fault.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.440
We just wanna talk!

18:28.524 --> 18:31.026
I will cut across Hill Street
and outflank.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.237
What? We're running plays now?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.656
Slow down!

18:35.739 --> 18:37.825
Make me, cop.
You can't prove a goddamn thing.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.243
About what?

18:47.501 --> 18:49.002
Police brutality, man.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.713
You do not know meaning of brutality.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.924
All right. Chozen, ease up.
We're not the police.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.803
Hey, hey, hey. I don't know
what you're up to, and we don't care.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.848
- We just have some questions.
- Yeah, right, Officers.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.101
I'm only here because my mentor might
have had some connection to your gym.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.103
I know this is a long shot,

19:07.771 --> 19:10.732
but have you ever heard any stories about
or… or know the name--

19:10.816 --> 19:11.692
Miyagi.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.613
Miyagi.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.369
Have you seen this one?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.913
It looks like the dog's actually talking.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.584
This night
really took a turn for the worse.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.128
Literally, there's no drama.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.504
Have faith, Lee.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.299
I know how girls think.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.426
It just takes one little spark.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.556
Why's Robby calling you?

19:43.223 --> 19:44.975
I don't know.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.354
What did you do?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.898
Stole Robby's phone.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.482
It's a nuclear option.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.693
Probably just a butt dial.

20:00.115 --> 20:00.949
What is it?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.035
It's a text from Miguel.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.453
What does it say?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.079
"Hola, Mamacita."

20:06.163 --> 20:08.749
"How about you drop the zero and…"

20:08.832 --> 20:10.167
"…get with the hero?"

20:12.586 --> 20:15.881
Robby's a zero. Miguel's a hero.
I'm not saying that as me.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.800
I'm saying that as Miguel.
I stole his phone too.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.094
Yeah, it's not that hard to follow.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.805
- Hey, hey, what's going on?
- What's behind your back?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.308
My hands. Nothing. Just my hands.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.395
Lee, your phone's ringing.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.318
Oh, wow, multiple lines. I didn't know
you were such a social butterfly.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.611
You're catfishing us.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.571
I don't know what that is,
but catfish is gross.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.699
You've been messing with us. Now
you're trying to get us to start fighting.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.952
We just wanted
to help you get your edge back

20:45.035 --> 20:47.621
so things can go back
to the way they used to be.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.040
You think things were better
when we hated each other's guts?

20:50.123 --> 20:53.293
No. Maybe just south of that,
like a really strong dislike.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.004
- I thought you were Miyagi-Do now.
- I am Miyagi-do.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.174
Look, we're inside with pillows,
chocolates, and air conditioning.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.760
I want you to hate each other,
but in a friendly way.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.138
- I'm calling an Uber.
- Same.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.184
I can't believe that didn't work.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.235
Hey.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.446
You try to get students angry at me?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.117
You think I'm afraid of them?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.452
No, I don't.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.372
I don't think you're afraid of anybody.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.375
I think you're cocky and disrespectful.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.045
But you combine that
with your skills and strength,

21:37.129 --> 21:39.631
I think you can be
one of the most terrifying fighters

21:39.715 --> 21:40.882
in the Sekai Taikai.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.845
I don't understand.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.764
Just take all that anger inside you

21:49.182 --> 21:50.809
and give it purpose.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.611
<i>Prove to the others that you are</i>
<i>the best fighter in the class.</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:04.656
<i>And there's only one way to do that.</i>

22:09.161 --> 22:11.955
What's the matter, Kwon?
Haven't had enough?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.458
I have had enough. Of you.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.509
You only know what you've been taught.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.928
You can't think for yourself.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.014
It makes you formidable.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.640
But also predictable.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.855
Where are you going?

22:37.856 --> 22:38.940
Come on.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.736
Come on! Hurry up!

23:12.099 --> 23:15.977
Oh, the teacher's pet is back.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.855
Keep talking, bitch.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.352
It's mine.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.622
You got me good there, guy.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.624
A cheap shot to my blind side.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.126
Don't be baby.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.004
I thought you were the IRS.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.884
Uh, I have a difference of opinion
with Uncle Sam on the gym's finances.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.343
I'm still just trying to understand

24:30.427 --> 24:33.346
why Mr. Miyagi would be
a silent partner in a boxing gym.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.849
He and my grandfather were bros.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.059
The way my pop-pop used to tell it, um,

24:38.143 --> 24:40.437
this gym wouldn't have been possible
without Miyagi.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.816
But why use this as a home address?
And what's with the different first name?

24:44.900 --> 24:48.195
When people have fake documents, it's
usually 'cause they're hiding something.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.280
At least that's what I've heard.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.365
Mr. Miyagi had nothing to hide.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.785
- Then why did he flee the country?
- Your information is wrong.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.331
Miyagi-san flee Okinawa for America.

24:59.414 --> 25:03.502
No. Miyagi definitely flee America.
Heard something about a robbery.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.587
Beat the shit out of some mope.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.840
Needed my pop-pop to help him get lost,
if you know what I mean.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.012
Whoa. This is it.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.098
I heard he stole some pricey necklace.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.309
- Wow.
- I never knew this side of him.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.689
Look.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.194
Your guy messed up.
But don't we all sometimes?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.531
Pop-Pop said
he trusted Miyagi with his life.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.952
He didn't throw around that kinda praise.
He was a tough old SOB.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.038
I wish I had more I could tell you.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.969
- My Uber's five minutes away.
- Yeah, mine too.

25:54.052 --> 25:57.430
My guy's got, like, a 4.99 rating.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.933
That's gotta be double Sensei Lawrence's.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.477
And three times his rating
for hosting a slumber party.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.483
Can't believe he stole their phones.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.902
He actually thought
we would fall for that.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.030
It's not like you haven't tried
to steal my boyfriend before.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.076
I was drinking.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.998
And regardless, I…
I know that was a huge mistake.

26:23.623 --> 26:26.543
But it was, like, over a year ago.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.963
- So, what, that makes it okay?
- The shit you pulled after wasn't.

26:30.046 --> 26:32.757
Oh, yeah, here it comes.
Little Miss Perfect LaRusso.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.969
- You attacked me at school.
- You attacked me at prom.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.345
You broke into my house.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.431
- You put me in the hospital.
- It's happening.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.058
I tried to make things right,
and you attacked me again.

26:42.142 --> 26:45.020
- No, you started this whole thing.
- Here we go.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.063
I did? Because the first time we ever met,

26:47.147 --> 26:48.857
you accused me
of stealing your mom's wallet.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.277
And even after you learned
that it wasn't me, you never apologized.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.822
I was already the new kid with no friends.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.492
And then as soon as I connected with
someone, you had to come in and ruin that.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.539
You… you're right.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.083
I'm sorry.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.460
Oh, come on.

27:09.085 --> 27:11.504
I was jealous and distrustful, and

27:13.173 --> 27:15.008
I made a really shitty call, and

27:16.801 --> 27:18.219
I should have apologized.

27:19.679 --> 27:20.513
Long before now.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.598
Yeah, well…

27:24.100 --> 27:24.934
I'm sorry too.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.980
Things went too far.
And if I'm being honest, it was my fault.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.901
I can't believe what I did to your arm.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.112
It's not that bad, actually.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.281
It's pretty much faded.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.577
A lot like this thing between us. Right?

27:44.037 --> 27:44.871
Yeah.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.581
I really am sorry.

27:49.125 --> 27:49.959
Me too.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.259
No.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.012
Could this night get any worse?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.347
Cheer up, Sensei.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.058
Maybe tonight didn't go as planned, but

28:06.393 --> 28:08.061
that could be for the best.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.110
I don't know what's worse.
Finding out he hurt someone or…

28:17.487 --> 28:19.197
never knowing the full story.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.158
Man at gym said Miyagi-san was good man.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.869
He was good man, Daniel-san.

28:24.953 --> 28:29.833
Yeah, a good man who…
committed robbery and assault.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.796
That's one story out of a million.

28:35.588 --> 28:39.718
It's one that he kept from me,
just like everything else in that box.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.179
We keep things from our kids, don't we?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.975
Are we ever gonna tell Sam
and Anthony about Cancun?

28:48.393 --> 28:49.519
Definitely not.

28:49.602 --> 28:52.063
Uh, what happened in Cancun?

28:52.981 --> 28:54.482
You're never gonna find out, Toguchi.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.156
Look, the best we can do

29:01.239 --> 29:04.451
is make the most of the time we have with
the people we love while they're here.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.913
Yeah, I know. I know.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.418
Good night, Chozen.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.587
Good night.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.222
Make most of time.

29:27.891 --> 29:28.725
Hmm.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.528
There is only one way

29:41.237 --> 29:44.616
to defeat an opponent
who fights with heart.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.661
By being heartless.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.499
Skill will only go so far.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.211
To pierce the heart

29:57.295 --> 29:58.296
of your enemy…

30:00.673 --> 30:02.133
you need to harness

30:03.092 --> 30:06.346
all that hate inside you.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.479
Are you ready?

30:14.562 --> 30:15.897
Yes, Sensei.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.733
Good.

30:19.609 --> 30:24.155
Because your opponents
will throw everything they've got at you.

30:24.239 --> 30:27.242
Then we give them no mercy, Sensei.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.118
Good.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.457
Warm them up.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.378
Viper attack. Begin!

30:41.297 --> 30:42.674
No more distractions.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.884
Very impressive.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.303
With Kwon in line,

30:47.929 --> 30:50.473
no dojo stands a chance against us.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.937
But there's still
one more piece of the puzzle left.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.445
Fight!

31:12.829 --> 31:16.124
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
What the hell got into them?

31:16.749 --> 31:18.418
I guess their breakthrough last night

31:18.501 --> 31:21.129
took care of
whatever was holding them back.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.137
Remind me
to never doubt you again, Sensei.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.222
It's like I always say.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.891
Girls are easy.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.153
I know there must be more to this story.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.532
And I know whatever you did,
you had your reasons.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.703
But why didn't you tell me the truth?

31:56.289 --> 31:57.749
Hey, everybody. Gather 'round!

32:07.133 --> 32:08.718
The announcement just came out.

32:09.594 --> 32:13.306
All right. Who's ready to find out
where we're going for the Sekai Taikai?

32:14.098 --> 32:17.101
<i>Congratulations on your admission</i>
<i>to the Sekai Taikai.</i>

32:17.185 --> 32:20.939
<i>We're excited to finally announce</i>
<i>the host city for this year's competition.</i>

32:21.022 --> 32:24.567
<i>Martial arts has always had</i>
<i>a rich history in the East.</i>

32:24.651 --> 32:28.112
<i>And the Sekai Taikai has held</i>
<i>many tournaments throughout Asia.</i>

32:28.613 --> 32:30.698
Soup dumplings, baby.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.075
<i>But in recent years,</i>

32:32.158 --> 32:35.912
<i>European teams have shaken up</i>
<i>the competitive landscape,</i>

32:35.995 --> 32:38.790
<i>bringing a whole new style to the event.</i>

32:38.873 --> 32:39.791
I'm feeling Germany.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.084
<i>Within that region,</i>

32:41.167 --> 32:45.505
<i>there's one nation that has continued</i>
<i>to stand tall amongst the pack</i>

32:45.588 --> 32:50.301
<i>for its growth and dominance</i>
<i>in both junior and senior competitions.</i>

32:51.511 --> 32:53.554
<i>It gives me great pleasure to announce</i>

32:53.638 --> 32:55.306
<i>this year's Sekai Taikai</i>

32:55.932 --> 32:58.101
<i>will be held in Barcelona, Spain.</i>

32:59.852 --> 33:01.354
Sick!

33:01.437 --> 33:02.438
- All right.
- Yes!

33:04.399 --> 33:05.441
That's awesome.

33:05.525 --> 33:09.821
<i>As you prepare for your journey, we'll</i>
<i>also present the rules of registration.</i>

33:09.904 --> 33:13.491
<i>We intend to test your dojo's quality,</i>
<i>not quantity,</i>

33:13.574 --> 33:16.703
<i>and each dojo must select</i>
<i>six fighters to compete.</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:18.162
Wait, six?

33:18.246 --> 33:22.000
<i>These six fighters</i>
<i>will participate in team events,</i>

33:22.583 --> 33:25.211
<i>with one boy and one girl</i>
<i>serving as captains</i>

33:25.294 --> 33:28.089
<i>to enter into the individual competitions,</i>

33:28.172 --> 33:30.800
<i>which will be televised around the world.</i>

33:31.300 --> 33:34.637
<i>We wish a hearty </i>bona sort
<i>to all competitors,</i>

33:34.721 --> 33:37.348
<i>and we look forward</i>
<i>to seeing you in Barcelona.</i>

33:37.974 --> 33:39.392
What exactly does that mean?

33:41.811 --> 33:43.187
It means we don't all get to go.
