00:15.807 --> 00:16.808
<i>Alice.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:20.020
<i>Even if I'm not here...</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:23.941
<i>I'm always with you.</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:27.236
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

00:28.612 --> 00:33.116
<i>my eyes are always on you.</i>

03:09.731 --> 03:12.025
<i>Houston. This is Birdsong.</i>

03:14.069 --> 03:15.445
<i>They are alive.</i>

03:19.825 --> 03:21.159
<i>I must've passed out.</i>

03:21.952 --> 03:23.203
<i>They're breathing.</i>

03:23.954 --> 03:26.206
<i>I can see their breath!</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:29.543
<i>But they were dead... Christ!</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:32.379
<i>I can see their breath.</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:34.548
<i>They are alive.</i>

03:36.091 --> 03:38.802
<i>They are alive.</i>

03:46.560 --> 03:47.644
<i>...passed out.</i>

03:48.145 --> 03:49.146
<i>They're breathing.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:52.274
<i>I can see their breath!</i>

04:00.532 --> 04:01.783
<i>They are alive.</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:03.285
<i>They're breathing.</i>

04:03.285 --> 04:06.371
<i>I can see their breath.</i>

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
Daddy, sit down.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.624
Sit down.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.258
Listen.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.719
Mummy died.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.097
I'm sorry.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.017
She died in the accident.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.935
Excuse me?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.563
Her body's still up there.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.358
You just spent two days with her
at the cabin.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.110
I heard it.

06:00.736 --> 06:01.904
Mummy's alive.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.489
She's just not with us.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.492
We lost our mummy.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.537
And there's another Alice.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.958
It's her mummy who came back.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.420
There's somewhere else.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.006
Something to do with the CAL.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.010
Alice.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.263
Mummy has a mental illness.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.392
Whatever she's told you, it's not true.

06:34.770 --> 06:35.979
Mummy's alive.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.693
You're wrong, Daddy.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.043
There's something wrong
with the machine. The image is corrupted.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.128
Show me.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.053
<i>The charges are</i>

07:50.053 --> 07:54.224
<i>that Mr. Caldera shot
Commander Paul Lancaster</i>

07:54.224 --> 07:58.061
<i>at 60556 Lexington Avenue</i>

07:58.061 --> 08:03.025
<i>at approximately 21:05 on Monday
the 8th of November, 2021.</i>

08:03.734 --> 08:07.571
<i>Furthermore,
that Mr. Caldera threw Mr. Ian Rogers</i>

08:07.571 --> 08:10.282
from the stern of the <i>SS Bernice</i>,

08:10.282 --> 08:12.075
off the coast of Santa Barbara

08:12.075 --> 08:17.539
at 23:35 on Sunday
the 17th of October, 2021,

08:17.539 --> 08:21.084
causing the death by drowning
of said Mr. Rogers.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.629
Go on.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.882
Mr. Caldera says he's not the person
who committed these crimes.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.759
Furthermore,

08:29.259 --> 08:31.678
he requests a polygraph test

08:31.678 --> 08:33.722
in order to establish his identity,

08:33.722 --> 08:36.099
and the memory of these things.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.352
I need you to compare my DNA

08:39.352 --> 08:42.813
with the inhabitant
of Bud Caldera's apartment.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.567
But you don't deny
that you are Henry Caldera.

08:45.567 --> 08:51.782
I think we already established that who
I am not is Bud Caldera, so-called.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.035
What I would suggest

08:55.035 --> 08:58.539
is that these two gentlemen
are one and the same person.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.207
With all respect, they are not.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.794
I need you to establish
where Bud Caldera lives,

09:03.794 --> 09:07.297
what his personal
and economic circumstances are.

09:08.131 --> 09:12.511
In short,
I need help knowing what his life is.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.934
Read this.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.730
I didn't write this.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.742
Well, Christ knows how much it cost.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.869
Probably millions.

09:37.870 --> 09:42.624
But she's taken a fucking axe
and given it 40 fucking whacks.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.714
I'm sorry.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.385
On behalf of the European Space Agency.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.475
She's being treated.
We're going to dismiss her.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.686
- Really?
- Yes.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.772
I remember, back in '64,

10:05.772 --> 10:10.152
first intake of lady astronauts.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.404
They just finished their physical, right?

10:12.404 --> 10:15.866
And Steven Winderuss,
the head of ops at the time,

10:15.866 --> 10:19.453
he wrote a report discussing
the problem of women in space

10:19.453 --> 10:25.501
and the intricacies of matching a
temperamental psychophysiological object,

10:25.501 --> 10:26.919
i.e. a woman,

10:26.919 --> 10:30.506
to a complicated machine,
i.e. a spacecraft.

10:32.382 --> 10:36.261
It is a problem we never solved.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.681
Henry, you're not concerned about this?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.308
No.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.311
No. What? It's a thing.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.104
We got lives to live.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.820
Alice?

12:28.123 --> 12:29.458
What is happening?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.293
Why am I locked in?

12:31.293 --> 12:33.003
Why am I here?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.464
You speak English? You speak Russian?

12:35.464 --> 12:37.174
Wait. Wait, wait. Please!

12:37.174 --> 12:39.968
Please. Wait, wait, wait. Please! Hello?

12:39.968 --> 12:42.930
Just please come back! Please!

12:54.525 --> 12:55.734
Has she got her phone?

12:57.569 --> 12:58.570
I don't know.

12:59.238 --> 13:00.322
Why don't you know?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.617
I have to talk to her about some things.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.538
I thought you thought she was dead.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.838
Alice. Eat your breakfast.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.590
- It tastes like shit.
- It does not taste like shit.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.175
You've never tasted shit.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.302
Look, you can't see your mother

13:22.302 --> 13:24.680
if you keep believing all this rubbish
that she tells you.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.517
<i>This isn't PTSD.</i>

13:29.351 --> 13:30.894
<i>It's not psychosis.</i>

13:32.229 --> 13:33.730
<i>It's not schizophrenia.</i>

13:34.523 --> 13:37.234
<i>That's what all schizophrenics
and psychotics say.</i>

13:39.486 --> 13:41.822
I need to get back to my daughter.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.283
You play the piano, correct?

13:47.411 --> 13:48.453
Play.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.415
There was a fire at my cabin.

13:54.543 --> 13:55.544
Before that...

13:58.005 --> 13:59.381
I saw my daughter.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.008
The real one.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.971
I haven't seen her
since before I went into space.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.055
Play.

14:07.723 --> 14:08.974
Are you a mother?

14:12.644 --> 14:14.730
You were traveling with your daughter.

14:16.732 --> 14:20.861
She was very sick after the fire,
but now she's fine.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.446
She's with her father.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.906
I could smell her.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.659
The real Alice.

14:30.996 --> 14:34.374
I could smell my daughter. I could.

14:34.374 --> 14:39.630
If this condition is not treated,
believe me, it will get worse.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.508
Why would you stop me from seeing her?

14:43.175 --> 14:44.384
Please.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.511
She's my baby.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.599
She's my baby and I lost her.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.060
You're pregnant.

14:55.646 --> 14:59.650
You know we have to perform pregnancy test
before administering lithium.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.487
It can be very toxic for the fetus.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.571
What?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.407
- Normally, we would give you...
- Oh, no.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.994
...1,800 milligram of lithium-7
to calm your symptoms,

15:10.994 --> 15:14.957
but you're in the early stages
of pregnancy.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.625
Four weeks.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.509
We have designed
an alternative drug therapy to treat you,

15:26.218 --> 15:28.387
but you must commit to it.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.806
Otherwise we need to shock you again.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.266
I can't have this child.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.185
If I have this child,
how will I get back to her?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.270
Please.

15:37.980 --> 15:38.981
Take these pills.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.566
I can see you are in pain.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.276
I can handle pain!

15:44.778 --> 15:46.530
This isn't madness.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.827
I need to go back to her.
Do you understand? I can't be here.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.295
What the fuck is that noise?

16:03.589 --> 16:04.923
There is another guest.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.259
You won't see this person.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.095
Incurable.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.556
Please don't go--

16:21.565 --> 16:23.650
It's you.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.697
There are flames...

16:30.657 --> 16:32.576
Fire! Fire!

16:33.535 --> 16:34.620
Capsule is on fire.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.538
Forty. Forty-two.

16:36.914 --> 16:38.040
I'm hot.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.918
The world is the wrong way round.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.736
Yeah?

17:08.819 --> 17:09.820
<i>Henry?</i>

17:10.364 --> 17:11.365
Yeah.

17:11.865 --> 17:15.868
<i>It's Irena.
I need to see you. It's urgent.</i>

17:17.287 --> 17:19.498
Have you ever met Ian Rogers?

17:19.498 --> 17:21.250
I don't know who that is.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.461
Have you ever been aboard the <i>SS Bernice</i>?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.003
Not to my knowledge.

17:26.630 --> 17:30.050
Did you meet with Paul Lancaster
at your home in East Hollywood?

17:30.050 --> 17:32.177
I do not have a home in East Hollywood,

17:32.177 --> 17:34.429
therefore I didn't meet
with Paul Lancaster.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.059
Have you ever met Paul Lancaster?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.143
Many times.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.230
What were the circumstances
of your meeting him?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.941
I don't recall the original circumstances,

17:45.941 --> 17:50.070
but we were both employed by NASA,
doing the ISS program:

17:50.571 --> 17:54.074
I as Chief Technician
on the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory,

17:54.074 --> 17:56.952
he as an astronaut and mission commander.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.584
Did you shoot Paul Lancaster?

18:03.584 --> 18:04.668
No.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.339
But I believe I may have killed him.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.133
How?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.137
I invented a machine that caused,

18:15.929 --> 18:20.392
or rather allowed for, the circumstance
of a fatal accident in space.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.618
I would love to hear you play.

18:38.869 --> 18:39.870
Hello!

18:39.870 --> 18:40.954
Ilya!

18:41.747 --> 18:43.415
Did they ask you to come?

18:44.249 --> 18:47.169
D-- Have you spoken to Magnus?
Did you see Alice?

18:52.466 --> 18:56.470
I've been asking a lot of questions
about this condition.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.307
Why don't you play?
I never heard you play the piano before.

19:00.891 --> 19:05.145
Ilya, this might sound crazy,
but it's not a condition.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.065
Listen, I've been reading
about Henry's work.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.025
Do you know where Henry Caldera is?

19:10.025 --> 19:12.486
What he's doing?
Maybe I could talk to him.

19:14.029 --> 19:16.156
They call it "astronaut burnout."

19:18.742 --> 19:21.328
Sense of dissociation. Paranoia.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.541
Feeling that familiar places
and people are impostors.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.793
It's happened many times.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.839
Good news is they can medicate it.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.884
Why did you come here?

19:38.762 --> 19:39.930
Irena is sick.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.474
She's hoping I take over.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.647
There needs to be someone here
who can look after people.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.148
Ilya,

19:51.483 --> 19:52.901
I've heard recordings

19:53.569 --> 19:55.696
of the radio transmissions
from her capsule.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.156
It broke up in space.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.033
She died.

20:00.868 --> 20:03.579
Irena was the body that hit the ISS.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.039
Paul didn't die. It was me.

20:06.999 --> 20:12.504
Jo, if she was the body that hit the ISS,
how is it that she's here?

20:13.088 --> 20:14.590
The same way as I'm here.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.594
We came from somewhere else.

20:18.594 --> 20:22.181
The most straightforward explanation
for the fact that you're both here

20:22.890 --> 20:24.516
is that you both returned alive.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.226
I don't remember her.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.105
She's the head of Roscosmos,
and I don't remember her.

20:30.606 --> 20:32.232
I don't remember the CAL.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.485
I don't remember Henry Caldera.
I don't remember my daughter.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.654
So there's something wrong
with your memory.

20:41.783 --> 20:42.784
Go away.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.833
There is so much for you here, Jo.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.177
Stop grieving and get better.

21:01.762 --> 21:02.763
Please.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.976
If you don't get better,
you will only get worse.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.041
I thought I saw her.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.002
In the snow.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.006
And for a moment, I was...

21:41.093 --> 21:42.719
I was so happy to see her again.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.516
I felt how much I missed her

21:48.183 --> 21:49.518
and how much I loved her...

21:52.729 --> 21:53.981
and how sorry I was.

21:58.777 --> 21:59.987
And then she was gone.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.700
I'm stuck in the middle.

22:06.577 --> 22:11.415
And they're both going through things
that I have absolutely no idea about.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.210
They've got secrets
that I'm not a part of.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.212
I don't know how to move on from that.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.634
And I don't know
how to move Alice on from that.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.849
How do we get back together again?

22:30.976 --> 22:33.270
Do you wanna get back together again?

22:35.856 --> 22:38.192
Feels like we're all floating in space.

22:39.151 --> 22:44.114
It just feels like
we're all floating in space.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.977
Boy, I'll tell ya,

23:15.354 --> 23:17.814
- this is better than what I'm used to.
- Henry.

23:19.775 --> 23:23.403
You make me feel obscurely better.

23:30.244 --> 23:31.245
What?

23:33.497 --> 23:34.706
What's different?

23:35.916 --> 23:36.917
Come on.

23:43.215 --> 23:46.969
You know, a long time ago,
when I was in training,

23:48.220 --> 23:50.556
Irena Lysenko, she went up to space.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.099
And...

23:53.392 --> 23:56.311
And she came back down in one piece.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.604
And oh, my.

23:59.189 --> 24:02.651
What a fine-looking girl she was.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.367
I never met her.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.203
But then I went away.

24:13.954 --> 24:16.415
For a long time, I wasn't myself.

24:16.415 --> 24:19.626
But that's when I recall hearing
that there was an accident up there

24:19.626 --> 24:21.003
and, in fact,

24:21.003 --> 24:25.007
Irena Valentina Lysenko suffocated
to death.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.886
That's the illness
that makes you think that.

24:28.886 --> 24:32.556
Henry, we both went through an accident.

24:33.390 --> 24:34.558
Felt strange to come back.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.893
It sure as hell was.

24:35.893 --> 24:38.478
You said you felt another person
walking alongside you.

24:38.478 --> 24:42.149
Someone has been sleeping in my bed

24:42.149 --> 24:46.737
and wearing my clothes
and eating my fucking porridge.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.240
Now, you're the expert.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.826
Now, if I start taking these again,

24:52.826 --> 24:56.246
is that going to smooth out
my little personality disorder?

24:57.122 --> 25:00.626
Henry, what's the matter?

25:01.210 --> 25:02.336
I'm not Henry.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.968
Henry is gone.

25:09.968 --> 25:14.389
And knock on wood, if I'm lucky,
he'll never be around again.

25:14.389 --> 25:19.645
But he will remember who he was
and he will live my old age,

25:19.645 --> 25:22.397
my addictions and my fucking failures.

25:22.397 --> 25:25.359
You need to come back with me
to St. Sergius. I can help you.

25:25.359 --> 25:26.610
No, I don't need help.

25:26.610 --> 25:29.571
I am the guy who won the Nobel Prize.

25:29.571 --> 25:33.492
I had my photo taken
with Reagan and Muhammad fucking Ali.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.160
That's me.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.747
And you can keep on denying it
and covering it up,

25:38.747 --> 25:40.457
just like you always have.

28:21.869 --> 28:23.245
<i>Do you believe in ghosts?</i>

28:24.746 --> 28:25.747
I don't know.

28:27.082 --> 28:29.877
<i>Sometimes I think my dad is here.</i>

28:30.419 --> 28:34.590
<i>I know he died,
but sometimes I think he's here.</i>

28:36.592 --> 28:39.511
Wendy, I think my mum's dead

28:40.554 --> 28:43.432
and there's another one here who's alive.

28:43.432 --> 28:45.684
<i>I'd trade places with you.</i>

28:45.684 --> 28:49.438
<i>Half alive and half dead
is better than all dead.</i>

28:49.438 --> 28:53.775
<i>Maybe some people can be there
and not there.</i>

28:59.698 --> 29:01.325
What happened to your dad?

29:01.325 --> 29:04.328
He was a bit crazy
at Mamma's funeral, whatever.

29:05.746 --> 29:06.997
<i>I don't know.</i>

29:07.748 --> 29:11.335
<i>He went to see an astronaut and got shot.</i>

29:13.295 --> 29:15.130
<i>He's in the hospital now.</i>

29:16.340 --> 29:17.716
<i>I'm kind of sad.</i>

29:18.217 --> 29:20.052
I'm still sad about my mamma.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.930
I think I saw her ghost.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.848
<i>Your dad's cool though.</i>

29:25.516 --> 29:26.517
He's grumpy.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.144
<i>He's a nice dad.</i>

29:30.854 --> 29:33.857
Yeah. I guess he is.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.299
Daddy, I know it's all make-believe...

30:01.301 --> 30:02.302
what she said.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.389
I know she didn't die.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.225
I'm very glad to hear you say that.

30:08.225 --> 30:10.519
So, can we go see her?

30:13.689 --> 30:14.690
Okay.

30:17.234 --> 30:19.319
- Do you want the stuff in this box?
- What is it?

30:19.987 --> 30:21.947
It's some things they found
outside the cabin.

30:22.823 --> 30:23.907
Yeah.

31:09.161 --> 31:10.871
That stuff's all marked "sitting room."

31:10.871 --> 31:12.164
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good. Okay.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.210
Alice, last chance.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.086
You wanna check upstairs
so you haven't left anything?

32:19.731 --> 32:20.732
Alice?

32:24.570 --> 32:25.571
<i>Alice?</i>

32:27.614 --> 32:28.824
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

32:48.177 --> 32:49.678
You wanna play a game?

32:53.724 --> 32:55.017
Is Mamma there?

32:56.810 --> 32:59.062
<i>I wanna know
if I really saw her at the cabin.</i>

33:02.858 --> 33:03.901
<i>Please?</i>

33:17.539 --> 33:20.876
<i>I wanna talk to her. Please.</i>

33:28.342 --> 33:29.885
Well, we're going now.

33:32.429 --> 33:33.430
Alice.

33:34.598 --> 33:35.641
<i>Alice.</i>

33:41.313 --> 33:42.231
Bye.

34:15.848 --> 34:16.849
There.

34:21.895 --> 34:24.188
I'm not going to look for Mamma anymore.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.192
Okay.

34:28.150 --> 34:33.991
There is another Alice.
She's somewhere else.

34:35.826 --> 34:38.203
She got Mamma instead of me.

34:39.496 --> 34:41.373
Well, that's a great way to look at it.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.003
I can't be angry at the other Alice
just for being luckier.

34:47.462 --> 34:48.797
I'm very proud of you.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.382
Am I brave?

34:58.765 --> 35:00.184
You're incredibly brave.

35:22.164 --> 35:23.665
My baby.

35:51.777 --> 35:53.320
And the polygraph?

35:54.571 --> 35:55.989
Passed with flying colors.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.075
And the DNA?

35:58.075 --> 36:01.912
If I am right,
mine twist in a different direction

36:01.912 --> 36:04.748
from which you found at Bud Caldera's.

36:09.211 --> 36:11.630
Nope. The DNA is exactly the same.

36:12.422 --> 36:16.343
And the polygraph only proves that
you think that what you're saying is true.

36:17.261 --> 36:18.262
It is true.

36:18.262 --> 36:20.681
The truth is a rare commodity these days.

36:21.390 --> 36:22.599
Has that passed you by?

36:25.561 --> 36:28.230
Henry, also known as Bud Caldera,

36:28.230 --> 36:31.775
I am formally charging you
for the murder of Ian Rogers

36:31.775 --> 36:35.195
and the attempted murder
of Commander Paul Lancaster.

36:35.195 --> 36:36.530
You do not have to say anything,

36:36.530 --> 36:39.658
though it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned

36:39.658 --> 36:41.660
something which you later
rely on in court.

36:41.660 --> 36:46.290
And so we move on to the night
of the so-called "double event."

36:48.083 --> 36:50.544
Three weeks after
the murder of Annie Chapman,

36:50.544 --> 36:54.464
September the 30th, 1888.

36:55.465 --> 36:59.428
And it was a wet, miserable evening.

37:00.512 --> 37:03.140
And extremely dark.

37:07.603 --> 37:08.687
At 1:00 a.m...

37:10.772 --> 37:15.402
the steward of the club steered his pony
and barrow through that arch,

37:16.737 --> 37:18.322
into the passageway.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.824
The pony shied to the left,

37:20.824 --> 37:26.121
spooked by something lurking
in the shadows of the alley.

37:27.915 --> 37:30.542
Jack the Ripper.

37:32.878 --> 37:36.882
If we move on to the next location,
I can show you where.

38:05.911 --> 38:06.912
What the fuck?

38:11.625 --> 38:13.126
I'm a retired police officer.

38:15.254 --> 38:16.255
I know.

38:25.138 --> 38:27.599
Live your best life, Ian Rogers.

38:49.246 --> 38:50.414
How are you?

38:55.210 --> 38:56.587
Who are the men upstairs?

38:57.129 --> 38:58.630
There is only one man.

38:59.965 --> 39:00.966
Who is he?

39:11.810 --> 39:13.937
The first man in space.

39:14.897 --> 39:16.857
- What?
- Take your medication.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.650
Play the piano.

39:19.735 --> 39:22.070
Do things your body is familiar with.

39:22.571 --> 39:23.780
It helps.

39:24.656 --> 39:27.784
Otherwise, trust me,
you will break in two.

39:32.289 --> 39:33.665
Did I die up there?

39:38.712 --> 39:39.922
Can I get back?

39:40.839 --> 39:42.341
Can I ever get back?

39:45.010 --> 39:46.345
Are there two of you?

39:48.597 --> 39:52.059
One dead, one alive?

39:55.896 --> 39:57.314
Are there two of me?

39:59.274 --> 40:03.070
How does that improve
our knowledge of ourselves?

40:03.695 --> 40:05.531
But if this is what happens up there--

40:05.531 --> 40:06.865
Enough.

40:08.575 --> 40:11.995
You have a child here to be mother to.

40:17.334 --> 40:20.671
And another, maybe, on the way.

40:20.671 --> 40:24.633
Accept this and let go.

40:29.346 --> 40:30.430
How could I?

40:30.430 --> 40:33.350
I can't.

40:33.350 --> 40:38.355
Because whatever it is,
it cannot be undone.

40:39.064 --> 40:41.066
You cannot change it.

40:43.235 --> 40:44.236
Ever.

40:47.197 --> 40:48.448
It's done.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.829
Live.

41:01.044 --> 41:02.212
Live.

41:39.791 --> 41:41.710
I've been thinking about the other Alice.

41:42.252 --> 41:43.253
Uh-huh.

41:44.630 --> 41:46.381
I think she feels that it's okay

41:48.175 --> 41:49.635
and that you're here with me.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.012
I feel that she thinks it's okay.

41:53.680 --> 41:58.227
We both lost someone,
but we found someone too.

41:59.311 --> 42:01.313
Doesn't mean we have to forget
the other one.

42:03.857 --> 42:05.609
Just means we have to accept it.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.409
Do we accept it?

42:18.747 --> 42:21.083
You're a remarkable young person, Alice.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.463
Your mother would be
incredibly proud of you.

42:26.964 --> 42:27.965
Are you proud of me?

42:29.967 --> 42:30.968
Yeah.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.263
I need a mummy.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.559
I need an Alice.

42:41.228 --> 42:44.273
That's me. Mummy, that can be me.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.576
This is what I saw.

42:57.077 --> 42:59.037
This is what collided with the ISS.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.292
Alice drew this.

43:07.296 --> 43:09.840
Well, she probably heard you talking
about it.

43:13.552 --> 43:15.470
I'm trying to be rational, Magnus.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.055
My husband is here.

43:17.556 --> 43:19.183
My daughter is here.

43:19.892 --> 43:22.102
It's obviously the same world that I left.

43:25.689 --> 43:26.690
But what?

43:29.860 --> 43:34.656
I'm gonna start taking the pills
if it means that I--

43:35.782 --> 43:38.160
I won't be living on this knife edge.

43:38.744 --> 43:42.623
If it means that I can come home
and be with you guys.

43:43.999 --> 43:45.250
And what about this baby?

43:46.502 --> 43:47.586
You always wanted another,

43:47.586 --> 43:51.381
but we haven't talked about it
since before you went into space.

43:54.301 --> 43:58.805
Are we in any fit state to have it?

44:03.560 --> 44:05.354
Do you want to have it?

44:10.651 --> 44:11.652
Do you?

44:44.560 --> 44:48.146
<i>My name is Irena Valentina Lysenko.</i>

44:48.730 --> 44:51.942
<i>I'm Executive Controller of Roscosmos.</i>

44:52.985 --> 44:57.573
<i>In 1967,
I became the second woman in space.</i>

44:58.282 --> 45:03.954
<i>Since that time under the USSR,
and since the fall of Communism,</i>

45:03.954 --> 45:07.791
<i>it has been my burden
and my responsibility</i>

45:08.292 --> 45:12.087
<i>to conceal a basic fact
about space travel.</i>

45:13.005 --> 45:15.883
<i>That it drives people mad.</i>

45:16.925 --> 45:18.844
<i>We know this.</i>

45:19.636 --> 45:21.221
<i>You know this.</i>

45:23.307 --> 45:25.517
<i>We pretend it's not true,</i>

45:26.852 --> 45:33.859
<i>but very many of us see and hear things
that cannot be explained...</i>

45:38.488 --> 45:41.825
<i>perhaps not even by calling it "madness."</i>

45:42.784 --> 45:46.496
<i>I'm asking whether you might be willing</i>

45:46.496 --> 45:52.503
<i>to report any of your own issues
anonymously to me.</i>

46:12.648 --> 46:15.192
Paul. Paul.

46:15.776 --> 46:16.944
Paul, let go.

46:16.944 --> 46:18.570
- I've seen something!
- Let go!

46:47.391 --> 46:48.642
I am sorry.

46:59.611 --> 47:00.779
Things are different.

47:05.534 --> 47:08.620
Magnus, do I seem like your Jo?

47:14.334 --> 47:15.335
No.

47:23.927 --> 47:24.970
I love you.

47:26.972 --> 47:30.350
I love you,
and I want you more than I did.

47:31.018 --> 47:32.311
Me too.

47:43.655 --> 47:44.656
Can I sit with you?

47:45.157 --> 47:46.158
Sure.

47:47.993 --> 47:49.828
Thank you for taking care of her.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.083
Here.

47:58.879 --> 47:59.755
What's your name?

47:59.755 --> 48:02.049
Irena Valentina Lysenko.

48:03.217 --> 48:05.928
But my friends call me Valya.

48:13.519 --> 48:15.729
Down the rabbit hole with you, Alice.

48:28.116 --> 48:29.117
Alice!

48:31.495 --> 48:33.330
To infinity and beyond!

48:33.330 --> 48:34.915
Just give me a minute, yeah?

49:00.524 --> 49:01.525
Mamma?

49:02.025 --> 49:03.026
Yeah?

49:03.819 --> 49:05.237
Can I ask you a question?

49:08.532 --> 49:12.327
If what happened happened--

49:13.495 --> 49:20.252
If I'm from here and Daddy's from here
and you're from there...

49:22.296 --> 49:24.089
where's the baby gonna be from?

49:35.142 --> 49:38.937
<i>Alice, even if I'm not here...</i>

49:41.940 --> 49:43.233
<i>I'm always with you...</i>
