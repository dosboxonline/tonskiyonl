05:38.422 --> 05:40.089
Mommy!

05:43.135 --> 05:44.969
Bad dreams?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.304
- Mommy.
- It's all over.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.348
Come here.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.934
It was in my closet.
Something's in my closet.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.978
Oh, too much junk food.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.689
Too much of the tube, guys.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.482
He's in there.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.736
Tad, now, there's nothing in this house
that's going to hurt you.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.530
Look what I see in the closet here.
I see clothing.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.782
I see a pile of blankets on a chair...

06:06.867 --> 06:09.326
a lot oftoys
that weren't put away...

06:09.411 --> 06:13.414
and your favorite
over-the-hill teddy bear...

06:13.498 --> 06:15.833
who would probably be
a lot happier-

06:19.838 --> 06:22.381
Who would probably be
a lot happier in bed with you.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.216
And that's it.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.219
- Nothing else.
- I saw him, really.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.971
He's in the closet.

06:29.056 --> 06:33.726
He has yellow eyes,
and his mouth is about this long...

06:33.810 --> 06:37.438
and he has teeth,
and they're curled like this...

06:37.522 --> 06:39.356
and he made sounds.

06:39.441 --> 06:44.070
What kind of sounds?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.948
Come on, try.
What kind of sounds? Like what?

06:53.288 --> 06:55.956
- That would scare me pretty good.
- Really.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.875
But he's all gone now,
champ, see?

06:57.959 --> 07:02.338
He's in there. I saw him. Really.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.964
Tad, you saw him in
your dreams—

07:04.049 --> 07:05.591
in your head, nowhere else.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.134
See, Tad,
there aren't any real—

07:07.219 --> 07:10.805
Tad, listen to me,
there's no such thing as real monsters...

07:10.889 --> 07:12.348
only in stories.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.600
There's no real monsters.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.145
- Really?
- Really.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.730
Really.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.943
Okay, over, done with,
gone, right?

07:24.027 --> 07:25.528
Over, done with, gone.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.905
What a guy.
Okay, snuggle in.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.743
Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.291
- You have good dreams now, okay?
- I will.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.550
There aren't any monsters, Tad.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.189
Except for the one in my closet.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.068
Please.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.197
Please. Please.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.683
Hey, Tadder.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.561
You know, it looks like someone
was moving furniture around...

08:40.645 --> 08:42.395
up in your bedroom last night.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.481
Any idea who that might have been?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.321
- Do you know, Donna?
- It wasn't me.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.907
It wasn't me, either.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.491
Wasn't me.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.204
Yeah, come on in, Steve.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.831
Morning!

09:00.916 --> 09:03.542
- Mrs. Trenton.
- Morning.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.295
Here you go, Tadpole.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.089
Just like I promised—
Brought your horse back.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.674
Looks pretty good stripped,
doesn't it?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.594
- Do we have a check for him?
- Listen.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.055
Why don't you just wait
until I bring your table back?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.641
Thanks.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.227
I can't stay for a cup
of coffee anyway.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.438
Sorry. Would you like a cup?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.023
Just teasing.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.943
Hey Tad, maybe it was Mr. Kemp
who moved all your furniture around, huh?

09:30.654 --> 09:34.531
Okay, what did I do now, huh?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.450
No, the monster did it.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.118
The monster?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.204
Oh, no. Come on,
remember what I said.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.290
There aren't
no such things as monsters.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.126
There aren't any
such things as monsters.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.045
Not in the daytime anyway.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.633
Come here, you!
Not in the daytime?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.677
I'll show you what a monster
would do in the daytime.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.304
He's grab your knee
is what he'd—

09:57.389 --> 09:59.807
- I know a lot about cereal.
- Daddy! Daddy! Look!

09:59.891 --> 10:03.060
Because I'm
the Sharp Cereal Professor.

10:03.144 --> 10:08.148
Sharp cereals: Twinkles,
Cocoa Bears, Brand 1 6.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.900
My daddy invented that.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.319
He made them all up.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.989
- Who?
- The professor.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.574
And they're good for you.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.828
Well, your daddy's
real smart, isn't he?

10:20.912 --> 10:23.247
As well as being a hell
of a tennis player.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.207
Ready for a rematch
any time you are.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.543
- Sure, sure.
- Gotta go.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.128
Bye.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.713
Thanks.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.011
Nothing wrong here.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.560
That's game, set, and match.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.520
- Good game.
- Oh, yeah, what was the score?

10:46.604 --> 10:48.897
- 6-love, 6-1 ?
- Yeah.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.236
You're not getting tired
ofthis, are you?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.780
What, are you kidding me?
Getting my ass handed to me every week.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.782
No, I love it, I'm a masochist.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.118
- Well, whatever turns you on.
- Yeah.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.652
...the onlyjeans that-

12:16.736 --> 12:18.946
Turn that off, please.
It's dinner.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.864
Turn it off, Tad.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.333
This marriage is definitely
running out of conversation, isn't it?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.885
Maybe we should talk
about having another baby.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.395
I got you!

12:53.440 --> 12:55.691
Oh, no, he's got me.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.276
He's got me!

12:57.360 --> 12:58.735
Watch my chair!

13:19.841 --> 13:21.842
Hi.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.385
Excuse me.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.722
I have a problem with my front wheel.
I wonder ifyou could look at it.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.725
Park it next to the Datsun.
Leave the keys in it.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.521
Well, I was kind of hoping
I could wait for it today.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.817
You're kidding.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.153
See you later, Harry.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.914
Joe Camber will do it for you.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.375
What's that?

13:55.460 --> 13:56.960
Joe Camber.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.713
Do a real good job,
and he won't rob you blind.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.677
Where's Joe Camber?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.971
You take 1 1 7 here
straight out of town...

14:08.056 --> 14:10.057
6 mile, give or take.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.726
All the way out to the end.
You'll see Camber's mailbox.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.311
You can't miss it.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.981
Thanks.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.319
See you later, Harry.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.863
Hi.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.742
Pa!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.673
Tough time finding this place.
How are you?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.968
My name is Victor Trenton.
You're Mr. Camber, right?

15:42.358 --> 15:43.859
Afternoon.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.032
You folks want anything to drink?

15:50.908 --> 15:53.327
No, thank you. Thanks.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.641
Vic?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.769
Come on, Cujo.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.354
Come on, boy. Come on.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.357
Get going. That dog.
Look at that dog.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.108
Don't worry about it, ma'am.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.527
Cujo won't hurt him.
He likes kids.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.157
- He's safe.
- Run me down the hill.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.618
- I want to have a listen to her.
- Yeah, okay.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.287
- Vic?
- It's all right.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.206
Yeah, it's all right.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.251
Don't worry, Mr. Trenton.
Your boy will be all right.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.101
Gently.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.895
Cujo. His name's Cujo.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.772
Cujo?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.898
How you doing, Cujo?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.608
Hey, boy.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.277
What kind of dog is he?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.904
St. Bernard.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.489
He's a great dog.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.200
Yeah, he's a pretty smart one, too.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.207
Monsters, stay out ofTad's room.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.959
You have no business here.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.753
No monsters in Tad's closet.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.506
It's too small for you in there.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.635
Where else?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.220
Under the bed.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.013
Under the bed? Okay.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.226
All right, no monsters under Tad's bed.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.855
You cannot fit under there.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.816
No monsters outside Tad's window.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.402
Can't hold on out there.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.738
Nothing will touch Tad.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.740
Nothing will hurt Tad...

17:54.824 --> 17:57.200
all through this night.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.785
Okay?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.664
They have no business here.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.379
Okay?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.101
Oh, my God, 1 :30?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.113
What?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.699
You're just really good
with him, that's all.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.745
How am I with you?

18:41.829 --> 18:43.330
Wonderful.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.667
Good night.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.018
Nothing wrong here.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.521
Well, that's not entirely true.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.023
This morning, thousands of
people across the country...

19:10.107 --> 19:13.068
reported internal hemorrhaging
after eating Sharp Cereal products.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.695
The scare, however,
proved to be a false alarm.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.239
- Hi!
- Hi.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.949
- Hi, Tad.
- Hi, Dad.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.410
Despite that fact, the scare
has reached alarming proportions.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.831
Sharp Cereal has been
unavailable for comment.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.667
Nope, nothing wrong here, folks.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.252
Cute.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.047
That's our ad campaign.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.007
They've recalled
the whole goddamn cereal.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.968
- There's no harm done, is there?
- No harm done?

19:38.052 --> 19:40.262
Donna, that guy comes into
America's living room...

19:40.346 --> 19:42.264
and he says to kids, "Trust me!"

19:42.348 --> 19:44.266
- Yes, I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.017
We created that guy-
Roger and me.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.270
- He's our brainchild.
- I understand.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.480
These kids, they go out,
and they buy the cereal.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.732
All the Sharp cereals.
All of them.

19:52.817 --> 19:56.862
Brand 1 6, All-Grain,
Cocoa Bears, Twinkles.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.239
And now, kids
all over the country...

19:59.323 --> 20:01.449
are peeing
and puking red dye...

20:01.534 --> 20:04.035
and scaring the hell
out oftheir parents...

20:04.120 --> 20:05.787
and we told them to buy it.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.706
The Sharp Professor is us!

20:07.790 --> 20:09.541
That's our ass, Roger's and mine.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.043
You'll work it out.
You always have before.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.753
Look, I appreciate
this isn't a world crisis—

20:13.838 --> 20:16.423
- This is not a mass suicide.
- That'll be Roger.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.966
Hello.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.801
Yeah, sure, Roger, hold on.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.386
It's Roger.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.018
Hi, Rog.

20:28.102 --> 20:31.897
Roger! Rog, calm down.
Calm down.

20:31.981 --> 20:35.066
We'll work it out.
We always have before.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.068
Well then nobody got hurt, right?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.613
What we're talking about here
is a lot of scared people.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.865
We're talking about recalling
the whole goddamn cereal.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.910
Well, that's not too bad.
I mean, it certainly could be worse.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.870
Hey, buddy, don't yell at me.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.622
- It's your dye, not my-
- Roger!

20:48.706 --> 20:51.124
...like there's
nothing wrong here!

20:51.208 --> 20:52.834
Look, no harm was done...

20:52.919 --> 20:56.796
and I'm sure, given time,
this whole thing will blow over.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.673
We're having a special
board meeting next week, okay?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.425
Special board meeting?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.510
We're going to reassess our
position re the Professor.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.512
- Sure, we can be there.
- You better be there.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.890
You better start taking this
a little more seriously, too.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.850
- I'm not kidding!
- Right.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.896
To reassess our position
re the Professor.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.359
We lost the Sharp account.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.743
Brett!

22:33.227 --> 22:35.854
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.064
Come here.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.317
I can't see you anymore, Steve.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.115
Well, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

22:47.199 --> 22:49.034
Just came by to tell you that.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.957
Okay.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.709
Can you tell me why?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.504
Jesus, I don't know.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.840
I got this terrific husband
and this terrific kid...

23:03.924 --> 23:06.926
and here I am, screwing
around with the local stud.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.887
No offense intended.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.764
None taken.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.474
What the hell's the matter?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.810
It's just over, that's all.
I want it over.

23:15.895 --> 23:20.565
It's not your fault.
It was just a stupid mistake.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.695
Okay.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.280
Whatever you want.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.371
Sorry.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.505
Hi, Punkin'.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.048
Hi! Look what I made.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.426
Hey, that's really nice.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.137
What happened to you?

25:14.221 --> 25:17.891
- Nothin'.
- Yeah? It doesn't look like nothing.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.684
I got hit by a swing.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.687
Come here. Let me make it better.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.109
Well, over, done with, gone, right?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.279
- Over, done with, gone.
- Okay, strap in.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.587
Oh, you like this, huh?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.172
It's fun!

25:52.885 --> 25:54.719
Bum, bum, bum, bum

25:54.803 --> 25:56.763
I see your heinie

25:56.847 --> 25:59.098
It's nice and shiny

25:59.183 --> 26:01.100
Ifyou don't hide it

26:01.185 --> 26:03.311
I think I'll bite it

26:04.897 --> 26:06.397
Daddy's home.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.191
Yeah, so I see.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.527
Okay, everybody out.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.115
- Hi.
- Daddy!

26:16.200 --> 26:17.700
My big guy.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.871
- Home early, huh?
- Yeah.

26:21.956 --> 26:24.624
- What happened to your head?
- Fell off the swing.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.501
Pinto's doing that thing again.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.461
I'll have to take it up to Camber's.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.630
- Yeah, I've heard that one before.
- Come here.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.340
- Would you like to play some baseball?
- Yeah.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.050
- Would you?
- There's a load of groceries here, Tad.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.386
That's yourjob.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.179
No. Not today.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.516
Go on. Go get your mitt.
You left it on the front lawn again.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.559
- Go on.
- Okay.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.730
So what did you do today?

26:48.899 --> 26:52.318
Oh, you know, the usual.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.404
Groceries, errands.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.407
Yeah?

26:57.491 --> 26:59.325
Roger come in today?

26:59.410 --> 27:01.577
No, he's still in mourning
for the account.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.638
What the hell is that?

28:02.723 --> 28:04.307
It's an engine hoist.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.560
You wanted one.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.438
It's the new hydraulic hoist
you wanted.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.523
You kept telling me you need one.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.193
You tell me what the fuck
is up here, Charity.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.029
Sit down and eat, and I will.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.614
Can't you use it?

28:22.326 --> 28:24.369
Damn well can't afford it.

28:43.097 --> 28:44.764
I won the lottery.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.733
$5,000.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.697
When do we get it?

29:02.950 --> 29:05.034
Two weeks. A little less.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.374
Thanks.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.794
I got you a present.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.506
You give me one, Joe. Okay?

29:22.970 --> 29:26.347
I want to go away
for a week with Brett...

29:27.391 --> 29:29.475
to see my sister in Connecticut.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.482
Boston?

29:36.567 --> 29:39.569
What the hell
are you gonna do in Boston?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.905
What makes you think
I could afford to go anyway?

29:43.699 --> 29:46.075
Shit! You're rollin' in it.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.454
You might have to dig out something
from the mattress is all.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.957
You're kicking up your heels a little,
aren't you, Joey?

29:53.041 --> 29:54.917
You're go right
to the Combat Zone...

29:55.002 --> 29:57.420
see a couple of dirty movies
and try to get the clap.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.174
You better look out, pervert,
or I'll sic my dog on you.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.717
That dog?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.385
You couldn't sic that dog on me...

30:04.470 --> 30:07.722
if I was coming at you
with a straight razor in each hand.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.809
What does your wife say about it?

30:11.894 --> 30:14.061
She don't know.
She don't have to know.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.646
Sure.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.608
She's going to take the boy to visit
her sister. Gonna be gone a week.

30:23.947 --> 30:27.700
You're going to spend the lump
ofthat lottery money, eh?

30:27.784 --> 30:31.871
- Shit.
- Broads, booze, baseball.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.790
I don't want to do it alone.
It's no fun. Come on!

30:38.295 --> 30:41.130
I don't give a shit if I do.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.301
Now you're talking.
Now you're talking!

31:22.047 --> 31:25.174
You've come to get me!
You've come to get me!

31:25.259 --> 31:28.427
How's my boy? You having
a good time at summer camp?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.179
It's yucky.

31:30.264 --> 31:33.558
Your mom said
you were having fun.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.601
Well, you want
to go home, then?

31:35.686 --> 31:38.646
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go. Over the shoulder.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.773
Yeah. Home we go.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.733
Think you can beat me
to the Jaguar?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.443
Think you can beat me?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.028
Come on.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.441
God, you scared
the shit out of me.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.026
I'm sorry.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.237
How'd you get
in here anyway?

32:28.322 --> 32:30.323
Finished with your table.
I brought it back.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.950
It's all stripped, and it's
a beautiful piece ofwork.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.911
Leave it on the back porch.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.580
I already did.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.833
Where's Tadpole?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.710
He's upstairs sleeping.

32:46.423 --> 32:47.423
Steve—

32:47.507 --> 32:49.842
I miss you, okay?

32:49.926 --> 32:51.510
You know, I miss touching you.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.971
Please, Steve. Please.

32:54.056 --> 32:55.556
Quit it!

33:03.398 --> 33:04.899
Steve?

33:11.365 --> 33:13.115
- God, it's my home!
- Stop it! What?

33:13.200 --> 33:16.535
It's my goddamn home,
you bastard!

33:16.620 --> 33:19.038
Bastard, it's my home!

33:19.122 --> 33:20.748
What the hell
are you doing?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.750
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

33:23.460 --> 33:25.670
Just get out of here, okay?

33:27.422 --> 33:28.923
Mommy! Mom—

33:31.343 --> 33:34.428
- What happened?
- The milk spilled.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.393
- Go out and ride your bike.
- Are you okay, Mommy?

33:40.477 --> 33:43.145
- Go on.
- Yeah, honey, I'm okay. Go ride your bike.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.525
I brought your table,
but I spilled some—

33:47.609 --> 33:49.610
Steve.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.129
Yes or no?

34:13.844 --> 34:15.344
Yes.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.922
Don't, you son of a—

34:58.180 --> 34:59.972
What is it, Tad?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.932
I don't want you to go.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.101
Well, I'll be back.
I'll be back in ten days.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.230
But I don't want
to go to day camp.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.941
Well, why don't you give
that another day or two, all right?

35:12.152 --> 35:14.153
Who's going to say
the monster words?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.946
Mommy don't know them.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.080
Come here.

35:32.297 --> 35:36.801
See, Tad, the thing
about the monster words...

35:36.885 --> 35:38.761
is they're written down.

35:38.845 --> 35:41.263
That's the only way
your dad can know them...

35:41.348 --> 35:44.433
so what I'll do
is copy them for you...

35:44.518 --> 35:46.310
and then I'll tack them
on your bedroom wall...

35:46.394 --> 35:51.357
and that way, your mom
can read them to you every night.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.818
- Will you?
- I will.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.945
I promise I'll do it
for you tonight.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.616
Okay, Tad,
time for your nap.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.119
I love you, sport.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.665
Come on.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.169
Did you fix it?

36:12.254 --> 36:13.838
No, I don't have the tools.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.216
Take it up to Joe Camber's.
It's only 7 miles.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.884
Yeah, maybe.

36:18.969 --> 36:21.136
I'll try and run it up Saturday
if I can get the time.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.013
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.062
Cujo?

38:21.549 --> 38:23.384
Cujo, what's the matter?

38:26.012 --> 38:27.638
Cujo, it's me, Brett.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.059
Take it easy, boy.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.021
I'm not gonna hurt you.

39:13.643 --> 39:17.312
I don't want you to go for ten days.
I don't want you to go for one day.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.815
Tad, I'll be back before you know it.
Now give me a kiss.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.700
I forgot to take
the Pinto into Camber's.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.829
I'll take care of it.

39:39.919 --> 39:42.379
Well, I'll see you.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.844
Vic! Stay there!

40:03.651 --> 40:05.569
I just wanted you
to know it was over.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.946
I just wanted to be
sure that you knew that.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.950
I can't make that it
never happened, Vic.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.037
I can't make like it never
happened either, Donna.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.705
I know. I know that.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.875
So I don't know what
I'm going to do yet.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.300
I don't know.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.782
Get the rest
ofthe bags, Brett.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.670
Mom?

41:04.754 --> 41:07.548
Mom, I'm worried about Cujo.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.633
I saw him this
morning in the fog.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.343
He was all bloody.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.387
He was dripping foam
at the mouth.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.014
Think I better tell Dad.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.641
No, you do no such thing.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.936
Your father would just jump
on something like that.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.272
You just leave him be, and he'll
come mooching around your dad...

41:23.356 --> 41:25.566
and your dad will take care of him.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.442
He loves Cujo.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.612
- Yeah. I guess he would.
- Tell you what.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.365
We'll call your
father tonight.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.450
When you talk
to him, you say...

41:36.494 --> 41:37.995
sort of casually...

41:39.747 --> 41:41.915
"You feeding my dog, Daddy?"

41:43.001 --> 41:45.377
- Then you'll know.
- Yeah.

41:45.461 --> 41:46.962
Brett!

42:50.860 --> 42:52.361
Cujo.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.155
What are you growling at?

43:19.347 --> 43:20.764
Come on!

43:20.848 --> 43:23.684
Come on!
I don't give a shit!

43:23.768 --> 43:26.770
Hear me?
I don't give a shit!

43:35.780 --> 43:39.324
You ought to be dead,
you stupid son of a bitch.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.842
Cujo!

44:52.231 --> 44:53.732
Shit.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.345
Gary!

45:27.308 --> 45:28.809
Hey, Gary!

45:48.913 --> 45:50.414
Gary?

45:59.382 --> 46:00.882
Gary!

46:14.981 --> 46:16.398
Oh, shit!

46:19.068 --> 46:20.569
Gary.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.131
Cujo.

47:26.219 --> 47:27.844
Oh, my God, you're rabid.

47:32.141 --> 47:34.226
Easy, boy. Easy, Cujo.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.616
One rolled over

47:49.700 --> 47:51.493
And the other one said

47:51.577 --> 47:53.078
Bum, bum, bum, bum

47:53.162 --> 47:54.913
I see a heinie

47:54.997 --> 47:57.666
It's nice and shiny

47:57.750 --> 47:59.584
Ifyou don't hide it

47:59.669 --> 48:01.753
I think I'll bite it

48:03.089 --> 48:06.508
Alice stepped in the bathtub

48:06.592 --> 48:08.677
Pulled out the plug, and then

48:08.761 --> 48:10.595
Oh my goodness!
Oh, my soul!

48:10.680 --> 48:12.389
There goes Alice
down the hole!

48:12.473 --> 48:14.808
Glub, glub, glub

48:21.607 --> 48:23.108
Come on, baby.

48:23.192 --> 48:24.985
Just a little more to go.

49:04.358 --> 49:06.901
Well, I think
we've arrived, Tadder.

49:06.986 --> 49:09.321
Yeah, but is anybody home?

49:10.364 --> 49:12.407
I don't know. We'll see.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.205
Hello?

49:23.878 --> 49:26.379
- I can't get my seat belt off.
- Hello!

49:32.053 --> 49:34.554
Just great. This is great.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.644
I can't get my damn
old seat belt off.

49:40.728 --> 49:42.646
All right. I'm coming.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.316
You're so impatient.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.736
Damn button's stuck again.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.655
Everything in this car is broken.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.991
I wish Daddy'd get a new car.

49:55.076 --> 49:56.743
Well, sounds good to me.

49:59.163 --> 50:00.705
Damn this car.

50:00.790 --> 50:02.457
You pull while I push.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.962
Oh, I can't get it.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.547
Pull!

50:48.170 --> 50:50.630
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

50:55.010 --> 50:58.012
It's the monster
from out of my closet!

50:58.097 --> 51:00.348
Oh, there's no monster.

51:00.433 --> 51:02.600
He got out of my closet!

51:02.685 --> 51:04.436
Oh, baby.

51:04.520 --> 51:07.105
How'd the monster
get out of my closet?

51:07.189 --> 51:09.232
Listen to me. It's not a monster.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.817
It's just a doggy.

51:35.301 --> 51:36.801
Okay.

51:38.471 --> 51:39.971
Okay, the doggy's gone.

51:40.055 --> 51:41.556
See, the doggy's gone.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.517
All right, we're going
to go home right now.

51:44.602 --> 51:47.520
- I want to go home!
- We're going right now.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.065
Oh, God.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.817
Damn this car!

51:56.238 --> 51:58.656
- Oh, I want to go home!
- Okay, listen to me!

51:58.741 --> 52:01.868
We can't go home
right now, okay?

52:01.952 --> 52:04.621
- We have to wait—
- I want to go home!

52:04.705 --> 52:07.415
Tad, we have to let— Okay.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.501
We have to let the engine—

52:09.585 --> 52:11.169
I want to go home!

52:11.253 --> 52:14.255
Okay. We'll go home.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.717
Okay, we're going to go
home in a few minutes.

52:22.264 --> 52:24.307
We'll go home
in a few minutes.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.364
Mom, aren't we going?

53:22.867 --> 53:24.367
Ma!

53:26.537 --> 53:28.246
Yeah, okay. We'll try it.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.041
Cross your fingers.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.544
Come on, baby. One more time.

53:40.509 --> 53:44.178
Great! It's fixed!
We're gonna go home!

53:56.692 --> 53:58.359
Fuck you, dog.

54:20.549 --> 54:22.550
Come on, damn it, turn over.

54:25.054 --> 54:27.680
God damn you! Come on!

54:29.224 --> 54:31.559
God, why didn't you
get this car fixed!

54:39.735 --> 54:42.403
Mommy, are you okay?

54:45.741 --> 54:47.700
Yeah.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.535
I thought you were mad at me.

54:52.665 --> 54:54.457
No, baby, never at you.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.966
Can he get us in here?

55:10.349 --> 55:12.475
Can he eat his way in here?

55:12.559 --> 55:14.060
Can he?

55:18.440 --> 55:20.108
I wish he would die.

55:22.027 --> 55:23.528
Me, too.

56:37.686 --> 56:39.187
Mommy?

56:39.271 --> 56:40.772
What?

56:40.856 --> 56:42.356
I gotta go pee.

56:43.525 --> 56:47.653
- Yeah? Tadder, you gotta go bad?
- Yes.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.238
Real bad?

56:52.451 --> 56:56.120
Okay, look. We're going to open
this doorjust a little crack, okay?

56:56.205 --> 56:58.206
You pee right outside here.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.836
- Why can't we go outside?
- Because it's too cold.

57:03.921 --> 57:06.547
Get your pants down. Ready?

57:06.632 --> 57:08.132
Okay.

57:08.217 --> 57:09.717
Okay, go quick.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.073
Zip up your pants, Tad.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.517
Don't open the window.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.978
Just gonna open a little
bit for some air.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:13.859
What's that?

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.444
The monster words.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.655
Oh, let me see.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.198
Please?

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.075
I'll give them right back.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:26.080
- Is there any more drink?
- Oh, baby.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:30.626
We gotjust a little bit left,
and I think we ought to save it, okay?

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:32.753
Can you wait? Just for a while?

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.589
- Yeah.
- Good. Thank you.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.343
Can I have my
monster words back?

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:41.929
Okay.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.518
"You have no business here.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.854
No monsters under Tad's bed.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:53.149
You can't fit under there.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.777
No monsters hiding
in Tad's closet.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.946
It's too small in there.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:02.658
No monsters outside
ofTad's window.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.536
You can't hold on out there.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.122
No vampires, no werewolves...

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.749
nothing that bites.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.709
You have no business here."

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.422
Maybe it will start now.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:21.427
I'm afraid to try it
because the battery is so weak.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:26.057
What does it matter
ifthe battery's weak or not?

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.808
We're just sitting here.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.186
Try it.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.771
Please?

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:34.482
Okay.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.082
Told you.

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:58.547
Don't worry. When the mailman comes,
we'll go home.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.144
Just lay them out like this.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.729
Okay.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.233
- George.
- Yeah?

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.611
Hold mail until notified.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.406
The Cambers.
Remember, George?

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.574
My mind's going.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:27.993
Thanks, Roger.
You saved me a trip.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.265
Get back in that barn, damn you.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.262
Oh, my God.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.800
It makes him angry.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:28.322
Baby.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.115
Quiet. Please be quiet.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.918
I want to go home.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:45.005
Oh, Mom wants to go
home very much, too.

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.177
I know, baby.

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.433
Nothing wrong here.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.319
This is ridiculous.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.113
We need a whole new campaign.

01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:11.198
Start from scratch, huh, Vic?

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.619
What? I'm sorry.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:18.205
Cut it, Frank.
We're wasting our time.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.749
Where are you going?

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.501
I need some sugar.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.186
Tadder?

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:56.887
Oh, shit.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.479
Mommy! Mommy!

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:56.984
Let me see!

01:09:58.069 --> 01:09:59.570
Mommy!

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:03.907
Okay, baby.

01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:05.576
I want to go home.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.661
Listen.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.246
Listen, Tad.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.959
- Tad, listen.
- I want to go home.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.919
Don't get out of the car.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.369
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
-Just wanted you to know.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:52.581
- Roger, I have to go back.
- Go back? Go home?

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.708
You can't do that.
This whole damn thing was your idea.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.460
- You can't do that to me.
- I know, Roger.

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.421
- I'm sorry. But I can't stay.
- Look, Vic, I understand.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.089
I know what you're going through.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:03.133
- You do?
- Of course.

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:05.260
You think I'm so wrapped up
in my own problems...

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:08.305
I can't see what's happening to you?
I see it, believe me.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.474
- It happens to everyone.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:12.976
Oh, you can't come up with an
answer to the Sharp account...

01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:14.561
so you think you're through.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.813
You think the creative juice is gone.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:19.399
It's panic, that's all, just panic.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.280
Hey, what did I say?

01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:27.324
Vic, what is eating you?

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:33.246
Donna's been having an affair.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.918
Before I left, she told
me she had quit it.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:40.379
Roger, she hasn't answered
the phone in two days.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.006
Shit.

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:45.217
I'm going back.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.969
I'm sorry.

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:50.931
Look, maybe she's spending
the night with a friend.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:52.599
Oh, I can't believe I said that.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.309
Call someone. Call the police.

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:57.688
- Have them go over and take a look.
- That's not the point.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:01.525
Goddamn it, Vic, you can't
run out on the Sharp account.

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:03.110
Wanna bet?

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:12.012
Please, God, get me out of here.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.434
Please get me out of here.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:57.390
Tad.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.812
Tadder, wake up.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:15.575
Oh, my God.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.160
Tad, wake up.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:21.456
Oh, my God.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.842
Now breathe. Breathe!

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.594
Give me your tongue.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.728
Come on, breathe. Breathe!

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.647
Breathe! Come on!

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:49.109
Tad, talk to me!

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.944
I want to go home.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.364
Tad, talk.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.199
Four little monkeys

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:57.784
Laying on a bed

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.121
One rolled over
and the other one said

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:05.041
I see your heinie
Nice and shiny

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.626
Right?

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:10.088
Then I think I'll bite

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:11.673
Okay.

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:28.648
Is anybody home?

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:37.407
Donna?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:42.389
We got two of everybody on that list,
didn't we, Bannerman?

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:45.225
Did we ever reach Missus—
What was her name?

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.895
- Her friend in Reardon.
- I said yes.

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.314
I am telling you, it was Kemp.
All right?

01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:53.900
This was Kemp who did this.

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:56.987
Where's your wife's car,
Mr. Trenton?

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.571
Her what?

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.824
Bothers me.
Kemp came here, right?

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.742
He grabs your wife and son.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:07.163
Why? Well, he's crazy,
which is reason enough.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:08.832
Where's her car?

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.334
It's in the shop at Camber's.
The needle valve is sticking.

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:13.253
-Joe Camber's?
- Yes. Joe Camber.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.588
- She was going to take it in.
- When would that have been?

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.674
- I don't know.
- I'll check it out.

01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:23.013
Wait. What are you
going to do about Kemp?

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.015
We've got an MV alert out on him.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:26.766
We'll pick him
up soon enough.

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.518
Kemp is taken care of.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.372
Oh, Tad.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:37.916
Not now!

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.959
Oh, please, not now.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.753
Please. Please.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.216
Breathe!

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.800
Not now!

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.722
I want my daddy.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:55.099
- Okay. Okay.
- I want my daddy.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.310
I'll get your daddy.
Oh, my God.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.771
I want my daddy!

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:08.321
I want my daddy.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:11.074
I want my daddy!

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:13.368
All right, I'll get your daddy!

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.684
Mr. Trenton?

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:39.936
They picked up Kemp.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.479
Are they all right?

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:43.606
Well, your wife and son
weren't with him.

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.775
He claims that he
never even saw them.

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:48.027
Oh, bullshit.
You don't believe that, do you?

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.113
Not after what he
did to the house.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:52.198
Well, that's the thing.

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:54.284
He admits that he
trashed the house...

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:55.994
and his story checks.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:58.580
Tell you the truth,
I believe him.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.960
What did Bannerman say?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.670
Well, he—

01:22:06.714 --> 01:22:09.549
He's probably following up some lead.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:12.051
We'll be hearing
from him any time now.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.597
Wait a minute.
You haven't heard from him yet?

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:17.473
He hasn't even called in?

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.414
Tad, baby.

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:29.420
Oh, baby, wake up.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:55.154
Dear God, save my baby.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.534
I'm losing my baby.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.584
Well, come on, then!

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:25.406
Oh, my God.

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:05.404
Oh, breathe!

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:28.469
Oh, yes!

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.429
Yes, baby!

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:36.060
Yes, my baby!

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:35.578
Donna?

01:29:36.455 --> 01:29:37.955
Donna!

01:29:38.305 --> 01:29:44.264
