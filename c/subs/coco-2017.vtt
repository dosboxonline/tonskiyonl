01:09.736 --> 01:11.773
<i>Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.</i>

01:11.947 --> 01:14.735
<i>Because of something that happened
before I was even born.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:18.780
<i>See, a long time ago,
there was this family.</i>

01:20.122 --> 01:21.988
<i>The papá, he was a musician.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:26.619
<i>He and his family would sing
and dance and count their blessings.</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:31.673
<i>But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:40.640
<i>And one day, he left with his guitar
and never returned.</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:50.684
<i>And the mamá...</i>

01:51.028 --> 01:53.611
<i>She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.</i>

01:56.199 --> 02:00.944
<i>After banishing all music from her life
she found a way...</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:02.532
<i>to provide for her daughter.</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:09.877
<i>She rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes.</i>

02:15.218 --> 02:20.555
<i>She could have made candy,
or fireworks, or sparkly underwear...</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:25.685
<i>for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes.</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:30.560
<i>Then she taught her daughter
to make shoes.</i>

02:32.152 --> 02:34.485
<i>And later, she taught her son-in-law.</i>

02:35.864 --> 02:37.730
<i>Then her grandkids got roped in.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:42.072
<i>As her family grew,
so did the business.</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:46.410
<i>Music had torn her family apart.</i>

02:47.501 --> 02:49.538
<i>But shoes held them all together.</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:55.415
<i>You see, that woman was my great-
great-grandmother, MamáImelda.</i>

02:56.760 --> 02:59.047
<i>She died way before I was born.</i>

02:59.596 --> 03:04.091
<i>But my family still tells her story
every year on Día de los Muertos...</i>

03:04.267 --> 03:05.599
<i>the Day of the Dead.</i>

03:05.727 --> 03:09.767
<i>And her little girl, she's my
great-grandmother, MamáCoco.</i>

03:10.941 --> 03:12.227
<i>Hola, MamáCoco.</i>

03:12.776 --> 03:14.938
How are you, Julio?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.270
<i>Actually, my name is Miguel.</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:21.025
<i>MamáCoco has trouble
remembering things.</i>

03:21.201 --> 03:25.195
<i>But it's good to talk to her anyway.
So, I tell her pretty much everything.</i>

03:25.414 --> 03:29.499
I used to run like this. But now
I run like this which is way faster.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.953
<i>And the winner is Luchadora Coco!</i>

03:34.214 --> 03:36.376
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.332
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.544
Miguel, eat your food.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.088
<i>My abuelita, she's
MamáCoco's daughter.</i>

03:43.265 --> 03:46.258
<i>Oh, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.</i>

03:46.435 --> 03:47.425
<i>No, gracias.</i>

03:47.602 --> 03:50.720
I asked if you would like more tamales!

03:50.897 --> 03:51.933
<i>Sí?</i>

03:52.107 --> 03:54.440
That's what I thought you said!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.902
<i>Abuelita runs our house
just like MamáImelda did.</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:01.905
No music!

04:03.493 --> 04:04.609
No music!

04:04.786 --> 04:07.904
<i>- Y aunque la vida
- No music!</i>

04:08.248 --> 04:11.537
<i>I think we're the only family in México
who hates music.</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:15.086
<i>And my family's fine with that. But me...</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:17.338
<i>- Be back by lunch, mijo.
- Love you, Mamá.</i>

04:18.675 --> 04:21.007
<i>I am not like the rest of my family!</i>

04:22.220 --> 04:23.677
<i>- Hola, Miguel!
- Hola!</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:31.848
<i>- Muchas gracias.
- De nada, Miguel.</i>

04:36.777 --> 04:38.268
Hey! Dante!

04:39.780 --> 04:43.490
Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.445
Fist bump!

04:45.619 --> 04:47.485
Good boy, Dante!

04:51.458 --> 04:53.950
<i>I know I'm not supposed to love music.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:57.461
<i>But it's not my fault! It's his!</i>

04:57.631 --> 05:02.217
<i>Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.</i>

05:02.385 --> 05:07.881
Right here in this very plaza,
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

05:08.058 --> 05:11.426
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in Méxican history.

05:12.187 --> 05:16.056
<i>He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:21.235
<i>But when he played music,
he made people fall in love with him.</i>

05:22.155 --> 05:23.896
<i>He starred in movies.</i>

05:24.574 --> 05:28.238
<i>He had the coolest guitar! He could fly!</i>

05:28.787 --> 05:31.120
<i>And he wrote the best songs.</i>

05:31.206 --> 05:33.072
<i>But my all-time favorite, it's...</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:36.910
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:38.749
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:40.542
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:44.425
<i>Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away</i>

05:44.594 --> 05:46.256
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

05:48.223 --> 05:51.057
<i>Each night we are apart
Remember me</i>

05:51.226 --> 05:53.183
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

05:53.270 --> 05:54.932
<i>- Remember me
- Remember me</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:57.267
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

05:57.399 --> 06:01.564
<i>Know that I'm with you
the only way that I can be</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:05.609
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:07.774
<i>He lived the kind of life
you dream about.</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.954
<i>Until 1942.</i>

06:15.959 --> 06:18.997
<i>When he was crushed by a giant bell.</i>

06:19.963 --> 06:22.376
<i>I want to be just like him.</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:34.222
<i>Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
I get this feeling like we're connected.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:39.643
<i>Like if he could play music,
maybe someday, I could too.</i>

06:40.650 --> 06:42.482
If it wasn't for my family.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.944
<i>- Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.
- Huh?</i>

06:45.113 --> 06:47.230
I asked for a shoe shine
not your life story.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.818
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.656
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home. So...

06:52.829 --> 06:55.822
If I were you, I'd march
right up to my family and say...

06:55.999 --> 06:58.332
"Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it."

06:58.501 --> 07:01.869
- I could never say that.
- You are a musician, no?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.832
I don't know.
I mean, I only really play for myself.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.841
Did de la Cruz become the world's
best musician by hiding his skills?

07:11.014 --> 07:15.975
No! He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.931
<i>Mira, mira, they're
setting up for tonight!</i>

07:18.480 --> 07:20.893
<i>The music competition
for Día de Muertos.</i>

07:21.024 --> 07:23.516
You want to be like your hero?
You should sign up!

07:23.693 --> 07:25.935
Uh-uh. My family would freak!

07:26.529 --> 07:29.988
Look, if you're too scared
then, well, have fun making shoes.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.609
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?

07:34.204 --> 07:35.695
Seize your moment?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.952
<i>Show me what you got, muchacho.</i>

07:40.543 --> 07:42.125
I'll be your first audience.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.383
Miguel!

07:52.472 --> 07:53.883
<i>- Abuelita!
- What are you doing here?</i>

07:56.393 --> 07:58.009
You leave my grandson alone.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.101
<i>Doña, please! I was just getting a shine.</i>

08:00.188 --> 08:03.306
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.936
He was just showing me his guitar.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.187
Shame on you.

08:06.945 --> 08:12.065
<i>My grandson is a sweet little
angelito querido cielito.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:16.160
He wants no part of your music,
mariachi. You keep away from him.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.250
<i>Ay, pobrecito. Oh, estás bien, mijo.</i>

08:25.547 --> 08:27.664
You know better than to
be here in this place!

08:27.841 --> 08:30.925
You will come home. Now.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.272
How many times have we told you?
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.769
<i>Yes, Tío Berto.</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:50.403
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Go away, you. Go!

08:50.572 --> 08:51.733
It's just Dante.

08:51.906 --> 08:56.947
Never name a street dog. They'll follow
you forever. Now, go get my shoe.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.872
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.203
<i>Ay, Miguel!</i>

09:07.297 --> 09:09.414
<i>You know how Abuelita feels
about the plaza.</i>

09:09.591 --> 09:12.299
- I was just shining shoes.
- A musician's shoes!

09:14.471 --> 09:16.463
But the plaza's where
all the foot traffic is.

09:16.639 --> 09:20.258
<i>If Abuelita says no more plaza,
then no more plaza.</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:22.476
- But what about tonight?
- What's tonight?

09:22.645 --> 09:27.106
Well, they're having this talent show.
And I thought I might...

09:27.734 --> 09:30.226
- Sign up?
- Well, maybe?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.528
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.323
What are you gonna do? Shine shoes?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.071
<i>It's Día de los Muertos.</i>

09:38.161 --> 09:41.325
No one's going anywhere.
Tonight is about family.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.285
<i>Ofrenda room. Vámonos.</i>

09:55.136 --> 09:56.798
Don't give me that look.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.634
<i>Día de los Muertos is
the one night of the year</i>

09:59.808 --> 10:01.640
our ancestors can come visit us.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.804
<i>We've put their photos on the ofrenda
so their spirits can cross over.</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.767
That is very important.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.687
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.104
<i>We made all this food, set out
the things they loved in life, mijo.</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:18.365
All this work to bring
the family together.

10:18.493 --> 10:23.659
I don't want you sneaking off to who
knows where. Where are you going?

10:23.748 --> 10:24.784
I thought we were done.

10:24.874 --> 10:29.619
<i>Ay, Dios mio. Being part of this family
means being here for this family.</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:33.456
<i>- I don't want to see you end up like...
- Like MamáCoco's papá?</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:36.629
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.709
But you're the one who...

10:37.804 --> 10:38.920
I was just...

10:39.013 --> 10:40.299
But... I...

10:40.390 --> 10:43.554
<i>Papá? Papáis home?</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:46.477
<i>Mamá, cálmese, cálmese.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:47.974
<i>Papáis coming home?</i>

10:48.064 --> 10:51.398
<i>No, Mamá. It's okay. I'm here.</i>

10:52.569 --> 10:54.151
Who are you?

10:55.738 --> 10:56.899
<i>Rest, Mamá.</i>

10:57.824 --> 11:02.819
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.
Miguel? Miguel?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.081
What are we going to do with that boy?

11:09.836 --> 11:13.045
You're right. That's just what he needs.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.648
It's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

11:42.243 --> 11:45.532
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.
Someone could hear me.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.292
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.501
Other than you. Ew. Okay.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.084
<i>Perfecto!</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:35.828
<i>I have to sing. I have to play!</i>

12:36.464 --> 12:40.754
<i>The music, it's not just in me, it is me.</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:45.633
<i>When life gets me down,
I play my guitar.</i>

12:46.933 --> 12:51.678
<i>The rest of the world may follow
the rules, but I must follow my heart.</i>

12:53.690 --> 12:56.683
<i>You know that feeling
like there's a song in the air and...</i>

12:56.859 --> 12:58.191
<i>it's playingjust for you?</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:05.282
<i>A feeling so close...</i>

13:05.368 --> 13:10.238
<i>you could reach out and touch it</i>

13:10.331 --> 13:15.952
<i>I never knew I could want
something so much, but it's true</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:18.663
<i>You must have faith, sister.</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:21.165
<i>Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:23.004
<i>He will listen. To music.</i>

13:23.386 --> 13:29.383
<i>Only a song, only a song
has the power to change a heart</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:36.556
<i>Never underestimate
the power of music.</i>

13:41.154 --> 13:44.397
<i>But my father,
he will never give his permission.</i>

13:44.574 --> 13:46.190
<i>I am done asking permission.</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:49.155
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

13:49.329 --> 13:51.070
<i>You must seize it!</i>

13:51.205 --> 13:55.165
<i>Señor de la Cruz, what did it take
for you to seize your moment?</i>

13:57.086 --> 14:01.706
<i>I had to have faith in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.</i>

14:01.841 --> 14:04.049
<i>It was up to me to reach for that dream.</i>

14:04.218 --> 14:07.586
<i>- Grab it tight and make it come true.
- ...and make it come true.</i>

14:12.352 --> 14:15.720
No more hiding, Dante.
I got to seize my moment!

14:17.106 --> 14:20.144
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.526
<i>Día de los Muertos has begun!</i>

14:27.200 --> 14:30.364
No, no. We have to make a clear path.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.951
The petals guide our ancestors home.
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

14:35.124 --> 14:39.118
<i>We want them to come and enjoy
all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.</i>

14:40.630 --> 14:43.122
<i>Mamá! Where should we put this table?</i>

14:43.299 --> 14:44.790
<i>In the courtyard, mijos.</i>

14:44.967 --> 14:48.085
<i>- You want it down by the kitchen?
- Sí. Next to the other one.</i>

14:51.099 --> 14:54.092
- Get under! Get under!
- Miguel?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.595
<i>Nothing! Mamá, Papá. I...</i>

14:57.730 --> 15:02.191
<i>Miguel, your abuelita had
the most wonderful idea.</i>

15:02.610 --> 15:06.399
We've all decided.
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

15:06.489 --> 15:07.570
What?

15:07.657 --> 15:08.989
No more shining shoes.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.909
You'll be making them every day
after school.

15:11.994 --> 15:17.615
Oh! Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
the family tradition.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.711
<i>And on Día de los Muertos!
Your ancestors will be so proud.</i>

15:22.839 --> 15:26.423
<i>You'll craft huaraches
just like your Tía Victoria.</i>

15:26.509 --> 15:29.172
<i>And wingtips like your PapáJulio.</i>

15:29.345 --> 15:31.678
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?

15:31.764 --> 15:35.348
Ah, Miguel.
You have your family here to guide you.

15:35.977 --> 15:40.312
You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...

15:41.357 --> 15:44.020
A shoemaker. Through and through.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.020
That's my boy! Berto!

15:47.196 --> 15:49.939
Break out the good stuff.
I want to make a toast.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.376
Dante! No, Dante. Stop!

16:14.056 --> 16:17.265
No, no, no, no, no! No.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.400
De la Cruz's guitar?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.738
<i>Papá? Papá?</i>

16:36.078 --> 16:39.867
<i>MamáCoco,
is your papáErnesto de la Cruz?</i>

16:40.041 --> 16:42.408
<i>Papá! Papá!</i>

16:54.138 --> 16:56.095
<i>Papá! Papá! It's him!</i>

16:56.224 --> 16:58.181
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.925
Miguel, get down from there.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.974
<i>MamáCoco's father was
Ernesto de la Cruz!</i>

17:03.064 --> 17:06.773
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna be a musician!

17:08.361 --> 17:12.025
What is all this?
You keep secrets from your own family?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.945
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.901
- Fills his head with crazy fantasies.
- It's not a fantasy.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.913
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
The greatest musician of all time!

17:20.998 --> 17:22.785
We've never known anything
about this man!

17:22.875 --> 17:26.164
But whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.911
This is no future for my son.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.588
<i>But, Papá, you said
my family would guide me.</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:33.088
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.634
I'm supposed to play music.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.881
Never! That man's music was a curse.
I will not allow it.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.637
- If you would just let...
- Miguel...

17:40.810 --> 17:43.518
You will listen to your family.
No more music.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.810
- Just listen to me play!
- End of argument.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.981
You want to end up like that man?
Forgotten?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.486
<i>Left off your family's ofrenda?</i>

17:53.656 --> 17:56.148
<i>I don't care if I'm on
some stupid ofrenda.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:00.364
<i>- No!
- Mamá!</i>

18:05.501 --> 18:08.710
There. No guitar. No music.

18:11.424 --> 18:16.419
Oh, come. You'll feel better after you eat
with your family.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.469
I don't want to be in this family!

18:19.181 --> 18:20.763
Miguel! Miguel!

18:39.535 --> 18:43.495
I want to play in the plaza,
like de la Cruz. Can I still sign up?

18:43.664 --> 18:44.700
You got an instrument?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.575
No. But if I can borrow a guitar...

18:47.710 --> 18:49.372
Musicians got to bring
their own instruments.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.960
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.131
<i>- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Sorry, muchacho.</i>

18:58.220 --> 19:00.633
- You guys have a spare guitar?
- No.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.888
- I need a guitar just for a little bit.
- Get out of here, kid.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.072
Great-great-grandfather,
what am I supposed to do?

20:00.533 --> 20:04.152
<i>No, no, no, no. Dante, stop! Cállate! Sh!</i>

20:25.808 --> 20:27.049
I'm sorry.

21:03.512 --> 21:08.724
<i>Señor de la Cruz, please don't be mad.
I'm Miguel.</i>

21:09.018 --> 21:13.513
Your great-great grandson.
I need to borrow this.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.934
Our family thinks music is a curse.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.525
None of them understand
but I know you would have.

21:22.865 --> 21:26.825
You would have told me to follow
my heart. To seize my moment!

21:28.329 --> 21:33.791
So, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna
play in the plaza. Just like you did!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.505
The guitar! It's gone!

21:44.845 --> 21:46.711
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

21:47.223 --> 21:48.714
The window's broken. Look!

21:53.854 --> 21:55.186
All right, who's in there?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.352
I'm sorry. It's not what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my...

22:00.611 --> 22:02.227
There's nobody here.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.039
<i>- Miguel!
- Mamá!</i>

22:19.129 --> 22:24.090
Miguel, come home.
Where are you, Miguel?

22:27.012 --> 22:31.757
<i>Dios mio! Little boy. Are you okay?
Here. Let me help you.</i>

22:33.269 --> 22:35.010
Thanks. I...

22:45.281 --> 22:46.943
Do you mind? Whoa!

23:07.845 --> 23:10.588
Look how big she's getting.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.258
Dante!

23:15.811 --> 23:21.478
You can see me? Wait!
What's going on? Dante!

23:23.444 --> 23:25.151
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:25.321 --> 23:25.902
Miguel?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.900
- Miguel?
- Miguel?

23:31.285 --> 23:34.778
You're here? Here, here.
And you can see us?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.413
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

23:37.499 --> 23:38.990
Remind me how I know you.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.992
<i>We're your family, mijo.</i>

23:42.922 --> 23:45.380
<i>- Tía Rosita?
- Sí.</i>

23:47.676 --> 23:49.668
<i>- PapáJulio?
- Hola.</i>

23:50.679 --> 23:52.011
<i>Tía Victoria?</i>

23:52.181 --> 23:54.468
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.350
He's not quite alive either.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.136
<i>We need MamáImelda.
She'll know how to fix this.</i>

24:00.314 --> 24:03.853
<i>Oye! It's MamáImelda.</i>

24:03.943 --> 24:05.650
She couldn't cross over.

24:05.736 --> 24:08.194
- She's stuck!
- On the other side!

24:08.405 --> 24:10.772
<i>Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?</i>

24:10.866 --> 24:11.982
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.284
I have a feeling
this has something to do with you.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.408
<i>But if MamáImelda can't come to us...</i>

24:17.498 --> 24:19.785
<i>Then we are going to her. Vámonos!</i>

24:35.391 --> 24:37.633
Come on, Miguel. It's okay.

24:50.906 --> 24:55.150
Dante? Dante! Dante, wait up!

24:57.579 --> 25:02.244
You got to stay with me, boy.
We don't know... where...

25:22.855 --> 25:26.269
This isn't a dream then.
You're all really out there.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.104
- You thought we weren't?
- Well, I don't know.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.899
I thought it might've been one of those
made up things that adults tell kids.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.698
- Like vitamins.
- Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.366
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.371
<i>Mija, it's not nice to stare at...
Ay! Santa Maria!</i>

25:49.465 --> 25:53.550
Are those... Alebrijes! But those are...

25:53.719 --> 25:56.382
Real alebrijes. Spirit creatures.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.134
They guide souls on their journey.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.972
<i>Watch your step.
They make caquitas everywhere.</i>

26:00.601 --> 26:02.638
<i>Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.</i>

26:02.811 --> 26:05.474
<i>Please have all offerings ready
for re-entry.</i>

26:05.647 --> 26:07.730
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.311
Some churros. From my family.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.317
How wonderful. Next.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.821
<i>If you are experiencing travel issues,
agents at the Department of Family...</i>

26:14.990 --> 26:17.482
<i>Reunions are available to assist you.</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:18.654
Next family, please.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.499
<i>Oh! Your photos are on your son's
ofrenda. Have a great visit.</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:27.408
<i>Gracias.</i>

26:27.544 --> 26:30.662
<i>And remember to return
before sunrise. Enjoy your visit.</i>

26:30.798 --> 26:36.669
<i>Next. Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda. Enjoy your visit.</i>

26:36.762 --> 26:38.344
<i>- Gracias.
- Next?</i>

26:40.849 --> 26:42.886
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.725
Shall we skip the scanner?

26:44.853 --> 26:48.187
<i>I'm on so many ofrendas
it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.</i>

26:50.109 --> 26:54.444
Well, shoot, looks like
no one put up your photo, Frida.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.823
Okay, when I said I was Frida, just now,
that was a lie.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.199
And I apologize for doing that.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.195
<i>No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.</i>

27:03.288 --> 27:06.656
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.329
Hey!

27:15.676 --> 27:19.295
Almost... there. Just a little further.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.512
Upsy-daisy...

27:25.686 --> 27:29.475
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!

27:29.648 --> 27:33.562
Aw. I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.818
<i>- Next?
- Oh! Come, mijo. It's our turn.</i>

27:36.071 --> 27:38.984
<i>Welcome back, amigos.
Anything to declare?</i>

27:39.074 --> 27:41.532
As a matter of fact, yes.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.234
<i>Hola.</i>

27:51.044 --> 27:55.709
<i>Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos.
Please report to Level Seven.</i>

28:05.350 --> 28:07.012
I miss my nose.

28:16.445 --> 28:20.029
<i>Come on, help us out, amigo. We got
to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.</i>

28:20.115 --> 28:23.608
<i>We are not visiting your ex-wife's family
for Día de Muertos!</i>

28:23.785 --> 28:26.493
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

28:26.580 --> 28:29.288
<i>I'm sorry, señora,
it says here no one put up your photo.</i>

28:29.458 --> 28:33.793
<i>My family always puts my photo
on the ofrenda.</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:36.921
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

28:37.090 --> 28:41.630
<i>- MamáImelda?
- Oh, mi familia!</i>

28:41.803 --> 28:43.294
They wouldn't let me cross the bridge.

28:43.472 --> 28:48.433
<i>Tell this woman and her devil box
that my photo is on the ofrenda.</i>

28:48.602 --> 28:51.766
<i>Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.</i>

28:51.939 --> 28:53.771
- What?
- We ran into...

28:58.820 --> 29:01.358
<i>- Miguel?
- MamáImelda.</i>

29:01.823 --> 29:03.985
What is going on?

29:04.159 --> 29:05.821
You the Rivera family?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.663
- Well, you're cursed.
- What?

29:10.749 --> 29:14.618
<i>Día de los Muertos is the night to give
to the dead. You stole from the dead!</i>

29:14.753 --> 29:17.086
- But I wasn't stealing the guitar.
- Guitar?

29:17.172 --> 29:20.631
It was my great-great-grandfather's.
He would have wanted me to have it.

29:20.717 --> 29:25.052
We do not speak of that musician.
He is dead to this family.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.130
You're all dead.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.721
I am sorry. Whose alebrije is that?

29:30.811 --> 29:31.927
That's just Dante.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.057
He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.683
He just looks like a plain old dog.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.773
Or a sausage someone dropped
in a barbershop.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.603
Whatever he is, I am terribly allergic.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.438
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.899
And I don't have a nose,
and yet, here we are.

29:48.078 --> 29:51.116
But none of this explains why
I couldn't cross over.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.196
Oh!

29:54.209 --> 29:56.826
<i>You took my photo off the ofrenda?</i>

29:56.920 --> 29:59.082
- It was an accident!
- How do we send him back?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.751
Well, since it's a family matter...

30:01.842 --> 30:06.052
the way to undo a family curse
is to get your family's blessing.

30:06.138 --> 30:06.753
That's it?

30:06.888 --> 30:10.973
Get your family's blessing and
everything should go back to normal.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.800
But you got to do it by sunrise.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.635
What happens at sunrise?

30:14.771 --> 30:16.728
<i>Híjole! Your hand!</i>

30:22.112 --> 30:24.729
Whoa, Miguel,
can't have you fainting on us.

30:25.365 --> 30:29.405
But not to worry. Your family's here.
You can get your blessing right now.

30:29.578 --> 30:34.494
<i>Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.
Aha! Perdón, señora.</i>

30:35.959 --> 30:38.246
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.210
Miguel.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.631
Nailed it.
Now say, "I give you my blessing."

30:43.717 --> 30:45.925
I give you my blessing.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.055
I give you my blessing to go home...

30:51.558 --> 30:56.519
<i>to put my photo back on the ofrenda,
and to never play music again.</i>

30:56.605 --> 30:58.813
What? She can't do that!

30:58.899 --> 31:01.733
Well, technically,
she can add any condition she wants.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.692
- Fine.
- Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.000
No skeletons!

31:24.633 --> 31:26.750
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.176
Two seconds
and you already break your promise.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.304
This isn't fair. It's my life.
You already had yours.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.096
<i>PapáJulio, I ask for your blessing.</i>

31:39.773 --> 31:42.140
<i>Tía Rosita? Oscar?</i>

31:42.442 --> 31:45.025
<i>Felipe? Tía Victoria?</i>

31:45.153 --> 31:49.113
<i>Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way or no way.</i>

31:49.199 --> 31:51.236
You really hate music that much?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.943
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.079
The same path he did. He's family.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.037
<i>- Listen to your MamáImelda.
- She's just looking out for you.</i>

32:04.131 --> 32:05.121
Be reasonable.

32:05.215 --> 32:10.176
<i>Con permiso, I need to visit
the restroom. Be right back.</i>

32:11.972 --> 32:14.464
Should we tell him there are no
restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

32:27.904 --> 32:28.940
<i>Vámonos.</i>

32:29.030 --> 32:31.488
We got a family looking for a living boy.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.067
If I want to be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.110
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.536
<i>Hold it, muchacho.</i>

32:41.751 --> 32:45.495
I found that living boy! Oh, whoa,
excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.666
Excuse me.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.470
No, no. Dante!

32:55.182 --> 32:59.893
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer. Falsifying a unibrow.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.223
- That's illegal?
- Very illegal.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.389
<i>You need to clean up your act, amigo.</i>

33:04.566 --> 33:09.778
<i>Amigo? Oh, that's so nice to hear you
say that because I have just had a...</i>

33:09.946 --> 33:14.065
<i>really hard Día de Muertos and
I could really use an amigo right now.</i>

33:14.242 --> 33:16.655
<i>And amigos, they help their amigos.</i>

33:16.786 --> 33:20.746
You get me across that bridge tonight,
and I'll make it worth your while.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.617
Oh! You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.

33:23.752 --> 33:27.416
I can get you front row seats
to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.459
I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.207
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

33:31.384 --> 33:33.421
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.634
But my shift's almost up
and I want to visit my living family.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.932
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

33:41.311 --> 33:45.055
- Can I at least get my costume back?
- No.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.099
<i>Some amigo.</i>

33:50.153 --> 33:53.612
Hey! Hey! You really know de la Cruz?

33:53.782 --> 33:56.115
<i>Who wants to... Ay! You're alive!</i>

33:56.326 --> 33:59.865
Sh! Yeah, I'm alive. And if I want to
get back to the Land of the Living...

33:59.996 --> 34:01.407
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.913
That's weirdly specific.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.824
He's my great-great-grandfather.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.955
He's your Gr... What?

34:09.672 --> 34:12.165
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.293
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait.

34:16.471 --> 34:20.465
Wait! Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!

34:20.600 --> 34:22.466
You know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good...

34:22.643 --> 34:24.976
<i>No, no, niño! Niño, niño, I can help you.
You can help me.</i>

34:25.146 --> 34:28.059
We can help each other.
But most importantly, you can help me.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.764
- Miguel!
- I'm Héctor.

34:29.900 --> 34:30.766
That's nice.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.360
<i>Espérame, chamaco!</i>

34:45.542 --> 34:50.788
<i>Ay, he is going to get himself killed.
I need my spirit guide... Pepita.</i>

35:03.393 --> 35:05.305
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

35:05.478 --> 35:08.221
Here. Nice alebrije.

35:21.202 --> 35:25.742
<i>Ay, ay, hold still. Look up. A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up.</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:32.166
<i>Aqui arriba, eso... Eh, la rayita.</i>

35:32.339 --> 35:34.706
Okay. Hey! Ta-da!

35:35.717 --> 35:37.083
Dead as a doorknob.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.387
So listen, Miguel,
this place runs on memories.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.549
When you're well remembered, people
put up your photo and you get to...

35:44.726 --> 35:48.595
<i>cross the bridge and visit the living
on Día de Muertos. Unless you're me.</i>

35:48.772 --> 35:50.354
You don't get to cross over?

35:50.523 --> 35:53.231
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!

35:54.277 --> 35:55.484
This is you?

35:55.570 --> 35:56.936
<i>Eh, muy guapo, eh?</i>

35:57.113 --> 36:00.072
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...

36:00.241 --> 36:02.949
then I put up your photo
when I get home?

36:03.119 --> 36:06.783
Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup.

36:06.956 --> 36:10.449
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.415
Like, tonight. So, you got
any other family here, you know?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.671
Someone a bit more accessible?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.540
Mm... Nope.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.384
<i>Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You got to have some other family.</i>

36:20.470 --> 36:23.884
Only de la Cruz. If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.

36:25.225 --> 36:29.219
Oh! Okay. Okay, kid. Fine! Fine!
I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

36:31.231 --> 36:35.817
It's not gonna be easy, you know?
He's a busy man. What are you doing?

36:35.985 --> 36:38.443
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.149
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.782
- It's how you walk.
- No, I don't! Stop it!

36:44.452 --> 36:49.447
<i>Whoa! Ernesto de la Cruz's
Sunrise Spectacular? Qué padre!</i>

36:50.083 --> 36:53.121
Every year your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show...

36:53.294 --> 36:54.626
<i>to mark the end of Día de Muertos.</i>

36:54.921 --> 36:56.378
And you can get us in!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.544
Hey, you said you have
front row tickets!

36:59.634 --> 37:02.422
That... was a lie. I apologize for that.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.088
<i>Cool off, chamaco.
Come on. I'll get you to him.</i>

37:05.265 --> 37:05.971
How?

37:06.141 --> 37:07.973
Because I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.

37:18.862 --> 37:22.731
<i>Remember me
Don't let it make you cry</i>

37:24.117 --> 37:26.279
You better have my dress, Héctor.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.534
<i>Hola, Ceci.</i>

37:33.710 --> 37:38.205
<i>- Hola.
- Ceci, I lost the dress.</i>

37:38.339 --> 37:39.375
<i>Ya lo sabía!</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:41.840
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.344
Thanks to you, I'm one Frida
short of an opening number!

37:45.889 --> 37:49.599
Dante! We shouldn't be in here.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.861
<i>No, no, Dante! Ven acá!</i>

38:15.710 --> 38:17.747
You! How did you get in here?

38:17.837 --> 38:22.002
- I just followed my...
- Oh! The mighty Xolo dog!

38:22.133 --> 38:27.925
Guider of wandering spirits. And
whose spirit have you guided to me?

38:28.056 --> 38:30.389
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.306
The alebrijes of this world
can take many forms.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.354
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.731
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come, I need your eyes.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.952
You are the audience. Darkness.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.449
And from the darkness, a giant papaya.

38:57.794 --> 39:03.916
Dancers emerge from the papaya,
and the dancers are all me.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.587
And they go to drink from the milk
of their mother, who is a cactus.

39:08.805 --> 39:14.472
But who is also me.
And her milk is not milk but tears.

39:15.812 --> 39:16.893
Is it too obvious?

39:17.021 --> 39:20.435
I think it's just
the right amount of obvious?

39:20.608 --> 39:23.817
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...

39:27.448 --> 39:28.780
Oh! And then it could go...

39:34.497 --> 39:36.454
And what if everything was on fire?

39:37.292 --> 39:39.329
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

39:39.586 --> 39:43.751
Inspired!
You have the spirit of an artist.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.418
The dancers exit.
The music fades, the lights go out.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.804
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage!

39:55.894 --> 39:56.930
Huh?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.178
He does a couple of songs,
the sun rises, everyone cheers...

39:59.314 --> 40:01.806
Excuse me,
where's the real de la Cruz?

40:01.983 --> 40:03.975
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

40:04.152 --> 40:07.611
He's too busy hosting that fancy party
at the top of his tower.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.327
<i>Chamaco, you can't run off on me
like that. Stop pestering the celebrities.</i>

40:15.455 --> 40:17.367
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here!

40:17.540 --> 40:20.203
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.789
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?

40:22.879 --> 40:25.622
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.506
He's your great-great-grandpa,
how come he didn't invite you?

40:28.676 --> 40:31.669
Hey, Gustavo!
You know anything about this party?

40:31.804 --> 40:33.090
It's the hot ticket!

40:33.181 --> 40:37.050
<i>But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never getting in, Chorizo.</i>

40:37.226 --> 40:39.468
<i>Hey! It's Chorizo! Choricito!</i>

40:39.604 --> 40:42.938
<i>- A-ha. Very funny, guys. Very funny.
- Chorizo?</i>

40:43.066 --> 40:47.060
Oh, this guy's famous!
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.527
I don't want to talk about it.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.439
<i>He choked on some chorizo!</i>

40:54.035 --> 40:57.528
I didn't choke, okay? I got food
poisoning which is a big difference.

40:58.873 --> 41:02.037
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.785
- Hey! I'm a musician!
- You are?

41:04.921 --> 41:08.790
If you really want to get to Ernesto,
there is that music competition...

41:08.883 --> 41:12.752
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.014
<i>No, no. Chamaco,
you're loco if you think...</i>

41:17.183 --> 41:19.175
I need to get
my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

41:19.352 --> 41:21.059
You know where I can get a guitar?

41:23.064 --> 41:24.896
I know a guy.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.703
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?

41:40.748 --> 41:43.411
- A footprint!
- It's a Rivera boot.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.660
- Size seven!
- And a half.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.415
- Pronated.
- Miguel.

41:57.765 --> 41:59.472
Why the heck
would you want to be a musician?

41:59.559 --> 42:01.676
My great-great-grandpa
was a musician!

42:01.811 --> 42:05.521
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.230
<i>No thank you. No! Guácala!</i>

42:07.316 --> 42:11.276
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.311
We're almost there.

42:17.660 --> 42:18.992
<i>Keep up, chamaco. Come on.</i>

42:27.962 --> 42:32.457
<i>- Cousin Héctor!
- Hey! These guys! Hey, Tío!</i>

42:32.633 --> 42:35.296
<i>- ¿Qué onda?
- These people are all your family?</i>

42:36.512 --> 42:39.801
<i>In a way. We're all the ones
with no photos or ofrendas.</i>

42:39.974 --> 42:42.591
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?

42:43.144 --> 42:47.388
<i>So, we all call each other cousin,
or tío, or whatever.</i>

42:51.652 --> 42:53.860
<i>- Héctor!
- Tía Chelo!</i>

42:55.740 --> 42:57.652
<i>Muchas gracias!</i>

42:58.117 --> 43:00.325
Hey! Save some for me!
Is Chicharrón around?

43:00.536 --> 43:04.280
Eh, in the bungalow. I don't know
if he's in the mood for visitors.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.374
Who doesn't like
a visit from Cousin Héctor?

43:16.677 --> 43:18.339
<i>Buenas noches, Chicharrón!</i>

43:18.513 --> 43:20.971
I don't want to see
your stupid face, Héctor.

43:21.099 --> 43:24.513
<i>Come on. It's Día de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.</i>

43:24.644 --> 43:26.226
- Get out of here.
- I would, Cheech.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.267
But the thing is,
me and my friend, Miguel...

43:30.441 --> 43:32.228
We really need to borrow your guitar.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.976
- My guitar?
- Yes.

43:34.112 --> 43:37.856
- My prized beloved guitar?
- I promise we'll bring it right back.

43:38.032 --> 43:41.901
Like the time you promised to bring
back my van? Or my mini-fridge?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.777
- Ah, you see...
- Or my good napkins?

43:43.871 --> 43:45.487
My lasso? My femur?

43:45.665 --> 43:48.157
- Well, no, not like those times.
- Where is my femur? You...

43:51.295 --> 43:54.788
<i>- You okay, amigo?
- I'm fading, Héctor.</i>

43:55.716 --> 44:01.257
I can feel it. I couldn't even play
that thing if I wanted to.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.721
You play me something.

44:06.894 --> 44:10.558
No. You know I don't play anymore,
Cheech. The guitar is for the kid.

44:11.190 --> 44:14.558
You want it, you got to earn it.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.896
<i>Ay, only for you, amigo.</i>

44:21.742 --> 44:23.074
Any requests?

44:24.412 --> 44:26.904
You know my favorite, Héctor.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.883
<i>Well, everyone knows Juanita</i>

44:49.770 --> 44:52.763
<i>Her eyes each a different color</i>

44:54.609 --> 44:59.070
<i>Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in</i>

45:00.406 --> 45:02.614
<i>And her...</i>

45:03.743 --> 45:06.781
<i>Knuckles they drag on the floor</i>

45:07.121 --> 45:09.454
- Those aren't the words.
- There are children present.

45:09.624 --> 45:13.163
<i>Her hair is like a briar</i>

45:14.503 --> 45:18.122
<i>She stands in a bow-legged stance</i>

45:20.134 --> 45:24.128
<i>And if I weren't so ugly</i>

45:26.140 --> 45:31.352
<i>She'd possibly give me a chance</i>

45:37.360 --> 45:39.647
Brings back memories.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.816
<i>Gracias.</i>

46:17.066 --> 46:18.807
Wait. What happened?

46:19.485 --> 46:20.851
He's been forgotten.

46:21.529 --> 46:24.237
When there's no one left in
the living world who remembers you...

46:24.407 --> 46:29.368
you disappear from this world.
We call it the final death.

46:30.079 --> 46:32.162
Where did he go?

46:32.331 --> 46:33.663
No one knows.

46:33.833 --> 46:37.497
But I've met him.
I could remember him when I go back!

46:37.670 --> 46:39.252
<i>No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.</i>

46:40.089 --> 46:44.709
Our memories, they have to be passed
down by those who knew us in life...

46:44.885 --> 46:47.377
in the stories they tell about us.

46:48.431 --> 46:51.094
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.931
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

46:56.105 --> 46:58.722
Come on, de la Cruzcito,
you've got a contest to win.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.863
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.907
How do you think
I knew your great-great-grandpa?

47:17.084 --> 47:19.667
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.

47:20.338 --> 47:23.502
<i>No manches!
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz...</i>

47:23.674 --> 47:25.381
the greatest musician of all time?

47:25.551 --> 47:29.090
Ah, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.925
But his music? Eh, not so much.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.889
You don't know
what you're talking about.

47:35.436 --> 47:40.272
<i>Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
Showtime, chamaco!</i>

47:46.614 --> 47:49.197
<i>Llévelo! T-shirts! Bobbleheads!</i>

47:55.998 --> 47:59.332
<i>Bienvenidos a todos!</i>

48:01.921 --> 48:05.289
<i>Who's ready for some música?</i>

48:06.384 --> 48:08.751
<i>It's a battle of the bands, amigos.</i>

48:09.136 --> 48:14.131
The winner gets to play for the maestro
himself, Ernesto de la Cruz...

48:14.308 --> 48:16.641
<i>at his fiesta tonight!</i>

48:17.061 --> 48:18.597
<i>That's our ticket, muchacho.</i>

48:20.606 --> 48:23.440
Let the competition begin!

48:40.167 --> 48:42.079
So, what's the plan?
What are you gonna play?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.585
<i>Definitely Remember Me.</i>

48:43.754 --> 48:46.918
- No! Not that one. No.
- Come on. It's his most popular song!

48:47.091 --> 48:48.332
It's too popular.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.421
<i>Remember me
Though I have to travel far</i>

48:50.594 --> 48:53.678
<i>- Remember me...
- Don't let it make you cry...</i>

48:58.352 --> 49:01.686
<i>- What about Poco Loco?
- Epa! Now that's a song!</i>

49:01.856 --> 49:05.349
De la Cruzcito? You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.689
Los Chachalacos!

49:19.957 --> 49:21.789
You always this nervous
before a performance?

49:21.959 --> 49:24.952
I don't know.
I've never performed before.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.086
What? You said you were a musician!

49:27.173 --> 49:28.755
I am! I mean, I will be.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.215
<i>- Ay!
- Once I win.</i>

49:30.551 --> 49:34.545
That's your plan? No. You have to win.
Your life literally depends on...

49:34.722 --> 49:37.214
you winning. And you've never
done this before! I'll go up there.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.633
- No! I need to do this.
- Why?

49:39.810 --> 49:43.850
If I can't go out and play one song,
how can I call myself a musician?

49:44.023 --> 49:44.979
What does that matter?

49:45.107 --> 49:47.190
Because I don't just want to get
de la Cruz's blessing...

49:47.401 --> 49:51.236
I need to prove that I'm worthy of it.

49:51.989 --> 49:56.609
Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment
at such a bad time!

49:59.580 --> 50:03.199
Okay! Okay. You want to perform?
Then you got to perform!

50:03.334 --> 50:06.418
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.382
<i>Now give me your best grito.</i>

50:12.468 --> 50:15.006
<i>- My best grito?
- Come on, yell! Belt it out.</i>

50:18.224 --> 50:21.308
Ah, it feels good. Okay, now you.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.436
Oh, come on, kid.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.027
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

50:41.121 --> 50:44.865
Miguel, look at me. Hey, look at me.
You can do this.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.791
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.461
<i>Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.</i>

50:49.630 --> 50:51.747
De la Cruzcito!

51:00.641 --> 51:02.633
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

51:03.394 --> 51:05.636
Bring back the singing dogs!

51:17.408 --> 51:20.196
<i>Qué bien! Vámonos! Whoo!</i>

51:28.294 --> 51:31.787
<i>What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:31.964 --> 51:35.583
<i>You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:35.759 --> 51:39.127
<i>Where should I put my shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:39.263 --> 51:44.099
<i>You say put them on your head
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor</i>

51:44.226 --> 51:48.687
<i>You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco</i>

51:49.023 --> 51:52.061
<i>The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yes-ing</i>

51:52.651 --> 51:55.109
<i>I'll count it as a blessing</i>

51:55.237 --> 51:59.151
<i>That I'm only un poco loco</i>

52:00.701 --> 52:02.192
No! No! No!

52:08.876 --> 52:12.870
<i>- Not bad for a dead guy!
- Not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso!</i>

52:20.220 --> 52:21.756
He's close! Find him!

52:21.889 --> 52:25.553
<i>The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy</i>

52:25.851 --> 52:27.513
<i>The sense that you're not making</i>

52:27.686 --> 52:29.552
<i>The liberties you're taking</i>

52:29.688 --> 52:35.650
<i>Leaves my cabeza shaking
You're just un poco loco</i>

52:45.162 --> 52:47.779
- We're looking for a living kid.
- About twelve?

52:47.915 --> 52:49.656
Have you seen a living boy?

52:50.584 --> 52:55.921
<i>Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-to
loco</i>

53:04.056 --> 53:08.892
<i>Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you. Eso!</i>

53:09.895 --> 53:12.933
<i>Otra! Otra! Otra!</i>

53:18.404 --> 53:20.612
- Hey! Where are you going?
- We got to get out of here!

53:20.698 --> 53:22.906
What? Are you crazy?
We're about to win this thing.

53:24.284 --> 53:27.777
<i>Damas y caballeros,
I have an emergency announcement.</i>

53:27.955 --> 53:33.292
Please be on the lookout for a living
boy. Answers to the name of Miguel.

53:33.460 --> 53:36.953
Earlier tonight
he ran away from his family.

53:37.089 --> 53:39.797
They just want to send him back
to the Land of the Living.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.043
Wait, wait. You said de la Cruz
was your only family.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.961
The only person
who could send you home.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.380
I do have other family, but...

53:46.557 --> 53:48.219
You could have taken my photo back
this whole time?

53:48.350 --> 53:51.218
But they hate music!
I need a musician's blessing.

53:51.311 --> 53:53.303
- You lied to me!
- You're one to talk.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.726
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.603
I don't even know
if I'm gonna last the night.

53:57.776 --> 54:00.314
I'm not gonna miss my one chance
to cross that bridge because...

54:00.487 --> 54:03.230
you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.569
- It's not stupid!
- I'm taking you to your family.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.154
- Let go of me!
- You'll thank me later.

54:07.327 --> 54:09.740
You don't want to help me.
You only care about yourself!

54:10.414 --> 54:13.327
Keep your dumb photo.
Stay away from me!

54:13.500 --> 54:14.490
No!

54:16.170 --> 54:18.958
<i>Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?</i>

54:20.340 --> 54:23.708
<i>Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!</i>

54:33.687 --> 54:38.102
<i>Dante, cállate! No! Dante, stop it.</i>

54:38.275 --> 54:43.020
He can't help me. Dante! Stop!

54:43.155 --> 54:45.067
Stop it! Leave me alone!

54:45.532 --> 54:49.651
You're not a spirit guide. You're just
a dumb dog! Now get out of here!

54:49.953 --> 54:52.536
- It's him!
- It's that living boy!

54:52.706 --> 54:54.197
- I heard about him. Look!
- He's alive!

54:54.333 --> 54:55.699
- He's alive.
- The boy is alive!

55:06.220 --> 55:08.633
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

55:08.806 --> 55:11.469
I am giving you my blessing
and you are going home.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.053
I don't want your blessing!

55:14.394 --> 55:16.226
Miguel, stop!

55:18.232 --> 55:22.192
Come back! Miguel!

55:27.074 --> 55:28.815
I am trying to save your life!

55:28.951 --> 55:30.908
- You're ruining my life!
- What?

55:31.203 --> 55:35.573
Music's the only thing that makes me
happy. And you want to take it away.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.907
You'll never understand.

55:41.171 --> 55:45.836
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

55:46.009 --> 55:49.753
<i>No dejaré de quererte...</i>

55:51.265 --> 55:52.927
I thought you hated music.

55:53.058 --> 55:58.053
I loved it! I remember that feeling...

55:58.772 --> 56:04.769
when my husband would play, and
I would sing and nothing else mattered.

56:06.196 --> 56:10.941
But when we had Coco, suddenly
there was something in my life that...

56:11.118 --> 56:16.204
mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down roots.

56:17.249 --> 56:19.912
He wanted to play for the world.

56:21.253 --> 56:24.462
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.873
Now you must make a choice.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.793
But I don't want to pick sides!

56:29.970 --> 56:34.305
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's supposed to do.

56:34.474 --> 56:39.094
Support you. But you never will.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.078
- Have a good time.
- Oh, how exciting!

57:02.753 --> 57:07.339
Oh, El Santo. I'm a big fan!
You mind if I...

57:12.512 --> 57:14.344
<i>Gracias, Señor.</i>

57:17.851 --> 57:19.638
- Invitation?
- It's okay.

57:19.811 --> 57:21.677
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

57:33.283 --> 57:36.526
<i>- Disculpen, señores...
- Hey, guys! It's poco loco!</i>

57:36.703 --> 57:39.036
- You were on fire tonight!
- You too!

57:39.206 --> 57:42.699
Hey, musician to musician...
I need a favor.

57:45.379 --> 57:49.043
<i>The competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.</i>

57:59.851 --> 58:00.887
Thanks, guys!

58:13.490 --> 58:16.528
<i>- Hey! Enjoy the party, little músico!
- Gracias!</i>

58:21.081 --> 58:21.787
Oh!

58:31.883 --> 58:33.590
Look! It's Ernesto!

58:35.345 --> 58:36.301
De la Cruz!

58:37.764 --> 58:39.221
<i>Señor de la Cruz!</i>

58:41.476 --> 58:45.390
<i>Pardon me!
Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la...</i>

58:50.944 --> 58:53.937
<i>When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.</i>

58:54.114 --> 58:55.776
<i>You must seize it.</i>

58:55.949 --> 58:57.941
<i>This one has a wise spirit.</i>

59:12.758 --> 59:14.465
<i>We're almost there, Dante.</i>

59:18.472 --> 59:21.089
<i>Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la...</i>

59:26.980 --> 59:29.393
<i>But what can we do? It is hopeless...</i>

59:29.483 --> 59:33.147
<i>- You must have faith, sister.
- But Padre, he will never listen.</i>

59:33.320 --> 59:35.858
<i>He will listen... to music.</i>

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:04.967
<i>Señoras y señores, buenas tardes,
buenas noches</i>

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.891
<i>Buenas tardes, buenas noches
Señoritas y señores</i>

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:13.357
<i>To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy! Qué alegría</i>

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:18.147
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:24.198
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:30.955
<i>For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia</i>

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.744
<i>For this music is my lang...</i>

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.716
<i>Are you all right, niño?</i>

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:55.892
It's you! You are that boy! The one
who came from the Land of the Living.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.026
You... know about me?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:02.900
You are all anyone has been talking
about. Why have you come here?

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:07.867
I'm Miguel. Your great-great-grandson.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:11.741
I... have a great-great-grandson?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:15.666
I need your blessing so I can go
back home and be a musician.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:20.671
Just like you. The rest of our family,
they wouldn't listen.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.007
But I hoped you would.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:30.556
My boy, with a talent like yours,
how could I not listen?

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:36.019
I have a great-great-grandson!

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:46.025
- Look! It's Frida!
- Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.245
<i>- It is an honor, Señora.
- Gracias.</i>

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.124
Hey, Negrete! Infante! Have you
met my great-great-grandson?

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.376
My great-great-grandson.

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:01.794
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.793
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:04.965
No dimple!

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.382
<i>To our friendship.</i>

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:10.474
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!</i>

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.306
Poison!

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.597
You know, I did all my own stunts.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:19.396
<i>Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me...</i>

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:24.777
All of this came from my amazing fans
in the Land of the Living.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.944
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with!

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.953
Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.334
- No! It's all great!
- But?

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:41.581
It's just... I have been looking up to you
my whole life.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:45.468
You're the guy who actually did it!

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:51.930
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music over everything else?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:58.224
It was hard. Saying goodbye to
my hometown. Heading off on my own...

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:00.687
Leaving your family?

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:05.860
<i>Sí. But I could not have
done it differently.</i>

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.367
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:14.155
And you, my great-great-grandson,
are meant to be a musician!

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:21.205
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.706
The world is our family.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.960
The fireworks have begun!

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:42.058
Soon the party will move across town
for my Sunrise Spectacular.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:47.731
Miguel, you must come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor!

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.990
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:56.656
I can't.
I have to get home before sunrise.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.825
Oh! I really do need to get you home.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:07.751
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.919
I hope you die very soon.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:14.135
You know what I mean.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:20.896
<i>- Miguel, I give you my bless...
- We had a deal, chamaco.</i>

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.267
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.437
Frida! I thought you couldn't make it.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.282
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:33.275
You know this man?

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:36.662
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.198
Héctor?

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.706
Please, Miguel. Put my photo up.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:48.257
My friend, you're being forgotten.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.630
- And whose fault is that?
- Héctor, please...

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.508
Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.380
What?

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:57.638
If I'm being forgotten, it's because
you never told anyone that I wrote them!

01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:00.853
That's crazy!
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.097
You want to tell him or should I?

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:08.979
Héctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but you died...

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:13.988
and I only sang your songs because
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.617
How generous!

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.904
You really did play together.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:22.121
I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:25.957
Miguel can put my photo up,
and I can cross over the bridge.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:31.547
I can see my girl.
Ernesto, remember the night I left?

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.044
That was a long time ago.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:36.513
We drank together and you told me
you would move Heaven and Earth...

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:40.472
<i>for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.</i>

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.145
Heaven and Earth? Like in the movie?

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.731
- What?
- That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.143
<i>In the de la Cruz movie,
El Camino a Casa.</i>

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:52.113
- I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
- No! It's in there. Look!

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.860
<i>Never were truer words spoken.
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!</i>

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.620
<i>I would move Heaven
and Earth for you, mi amigo.</i>

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:02.785
But in the movie,
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.876
<i>- Salud!
- Poison!</i>

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:11.548
That night, Ernesto. The night I left...

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.467
<i>We'd been performing on the road
for months. I got homesick...</i>

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.217
<i>and I packed up my songs.</i>

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:22.426
You want to give up now when
we're this close to reaching our dream?

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.394
This was your dream. You'll manage.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:26.229
I can't do this
without your songs, Héctor.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:30.021
I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me
if you want, but my mind is made up.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:39.494
I could never hate you. If you must go,
then I'm sending you off with a toast.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:44.577
To our friendship.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:48.916
<i>I would move Heaven and Earth for you,
mi amigo. Salud!</i>

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.754
<i>You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.</i>

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.263
<i>I thought
it must have been something I ate.</i>

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.265
<i>Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.</i>

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.144
<i>Or something I drank.</i>

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.516
<i>I woke up dead.</i>

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.607
You poisoned me.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.024
You're confusing movies
with reality, Héctor.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.444
All this time,
I thought it was just bad luck.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.784
<i>I never thought that you might have...
That you...</i>

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.337
- How could you?
- Héctor!

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.421
Security! Security!

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:38.420
You took everything away from me!
You rat!

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.347
Have him taken care of. He's not well.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.681
I just wanted to go back home. No! No!

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:52.274
I apologize. Where were we?

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:54.769
You were going to
give me your blessing.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.108
<i>Yes. Sí.</i>

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:03.152
Miguel, my reputation...

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:09.458
It is very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:13.000
That you murdered
Héctor for his songs?

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.042
You don't think that. Do you?

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:22.763
I... No.
Everyone knows you're the good guy.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.180
<i>PapáErnesto, my blessing?</i>

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:39.322
Security? Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.782
What? But I'm your family!

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.026
And Héctor was my best friend.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:48.197
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:53.124
You have to be willing to do
whatever it takes to seize your moment.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.875
I know you understand.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.041
No! No!

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.087
Let go! No!

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:32.075
Help! Can anyone hear me?
I want to go home.

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.428
- Héctor?
- Kid?

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:58.272
Héctor! You were right.
I should have gone back to my family.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:02.688
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,
but I didn't listen.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.616
I told them
I didn't care if they remembered me.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:08.778
<i>I didn't care if I was
on their stupid ofrenda.</i>

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:11.656
<i>Hey, chamaco. It's okay. It's okay.</i>

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.249
I told them I didn't care.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:21.131
Héctor! Héctor?

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.793
She's forgetting me.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.635
- Who?
- My daughter.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:35.016
She's the reason
you wanted to cross the bridge.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:41.314
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.779
I wish I could apologize.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:48.151
<i>I wish I could tell her that
her papáwas trying to come home.</i>

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:51.279
That he loved her so much.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.077
My Coco...

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.248
Coco?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.809
Where did you get this?

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:22.480
<i>That's my MamáCoco.
That's my MamáImelda.</i>

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.317
Is that you?

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:33.492
We're... family?

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:50.547
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:54.888
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.515
You know the worst part?

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.727
Even if I never got to see Coco
in the living world...

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.816
I thought at least one day I'd see
her here. Give her the biggest hug.

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.615
But she's the last person
who remembers me.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.781
The moment she's gone
from the living world...

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:19.834
You disappear... from this one.
You'll never get to see her.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.584
Ever again.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:27.374
You know, I wrote her a song once.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:31.508
We used to sing it every night
at the same time.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.423
No matter how far apart we were.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:41.105
What I wouldn't give to sing it to her
one... last... time.

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:46.273
<i>Remember me</i>

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:51.114
<i>Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me</i>

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:55.865
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

01:12:55.955 --> 01:13:01.121
<i>For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart</i>

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:06.543
<i>I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart</i>

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.459
<i>Remember me</i>

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.089
<i>Papá!</i>

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:16.306
<i>Though I have to travel far
Remember me</i>

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.811
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.226
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:33.782
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:42.333
<i>Remember me</i>

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:51.675
He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:56.004
You should be the one the world
remembers, not de la Cruz!

01:13:56.182 --> 01:14:00.347
<i>I didn't write Remember Me
for the world. I wrote it for Coco.</i>

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.680
I'm a pretty sorry excuse
for a great-great-grandpa.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.726
Are you kidding? A minute ago
I thought I was related to a murderer.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:13.652
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life, there's been something...

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:17.363
that made me different.
And I never knew where it came from.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:20.696
But now I know. It comes from you.

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:26.998
I'm proud we're family!
I'm proud to be his family!

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:37.091
I'm proud to be his family!

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.069
Dante?

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.448
Dante!

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.360
It's Dante!

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.420
- Imelda!
- Héctor.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.634
You look good.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:31.271
<i>Dante! You knew he was my
PapáHéctor the whole time!</i>

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.356
You are a real spirit guide.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.942
Who's the good spirit guide? You are!

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.338
Dante!

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:21.988
There they are!

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:26.781
Miguel! Miguelito! Look, it's Miguel!
He's all right.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.788
<i>Gracias, Dios mío.
Qué bueno.</i>

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:49.227
<i>Mijo, I was so worried!
Thank goodness we found you in time.</i>

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:54.016
And you... How many times
must I turn you away?

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:54.899
Imelda.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:58.361
I want nothing to do with you!
Not in life, not in death!

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:01.990
I spent decades protecting my family
from your mistakes.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:05.532
He spends five minutes with you
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.320
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:11.871
He was in there because of me.
He was just trying to get me home!

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:16.038
I didn't want to listen, but he was right.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.540
Nothing's more important than family.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.882
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:27.049
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.384
To get Héctor's photo.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:30.894
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.348
<i>Héctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.</i>

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:35.602
He left this family!

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:39.193
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him!

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.400
- It's true, Imelda.
- And so what if it's true?

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.739
You leave me alone
with a child to raise...

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.904
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.071
Imelda, I...

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.282
Héctor!

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:58.414
I'm running out of time. It's Coco.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.174
She's forgetting you.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:07.302
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:12.139
I wanted to forget you.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:16.182
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.941
This is my fault. Not yours.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.150
I'm sorry, Imelda.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:32.573
Miguel, if we help you get his photo,
you will return home?

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.115
No more music?

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.748
Family comes first.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:43.250
I can't forgive you.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.965
But I will help you.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.341
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.761
I might know a way.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.614
<i>- Good luck, muchacho.
- Gracias, Frida.</i>

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.366
- Here, let me help you with...
- Don't touch me!

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.623
- Everyone clear on the plan?
- Find Héctor's photo.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.629
- Give it to Miguel.
- Send Miguel home.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:04.998
Got your petals?

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.381
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:09.294
Yes?

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.300
Don't I know you?

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.512
That's for murdering the love of my life!

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.977
- Who... Who the...
- She's talking about me!

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.890
- I'm the love of your life?
- I don't know. I'm still angry at you.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.436
Héctor! How did you...

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.356
And that's for trying to
murder my grandson.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:27.312
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me!

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:31.820
You! Wait. You're related to Héctor?

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.072
The photo!

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:38.699
After him!

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.915
<i>Security! Ayúdenme!</i>

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.960
- You said love of your life.
- I don't know what I said.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.207
That's what I heard.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.098
<i>Places, Señor.
You're on in thirty seconds.</i>

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:12.365
<i>Ay! Miguel! I have it!</i>

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.711
Hurry! Come on!

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.136
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:39.222
<i>the one... the only...
Ernesto de la Cruz!</i>

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.561
Get her off the stage.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.492
Sing! Sing!

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:11.838
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:17.555
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.892
<i>Ay, de mi Llorona</i>

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:29.355
<i>Llorona de azul celeste</i>

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:36.032
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:44.830
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:50.709
<i>Me subí al pino más alto, Llorona</i>

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:53.296
<i>A ver si te divisaba</i>

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:57.383
<i>Como el pino era tierno, Llorona</i>

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.133
<i>Al verme llorar, lloraba</i>

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:07.932
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:15.151
<i>Ay de mí Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul celeste</i>

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:19.326
<i>Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.454
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:26.245
<i>- Let go of me!
- Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona</i>

01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:36.876
<i>No dejaré de quererte</i>

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:41.256
<i>Ay, ay, ay</i>

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.107
I forgot what that felt like.

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:54.936
You still got it.

01:24:01.078 --> 01:24:03.786
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:10.953
To go home, to put up our photos
and to never...

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.836
Never play music again.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:19.219
To never forget
how much your family loves you.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.426
You're going home.

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:28.599
You're not going anywhere.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:31.647
Imelda!

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:37.275
Stay back! Stay back! All of you,
stay back. Not one more step.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.781
Dante!

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:46.200
Ernesto, stop! Leave the boy alone.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:50.450
I've worked too hard, Héctor.
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.669
He's a living child, Ernesto.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:54.170
He's a threat!

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:57.832
<i>You think I'd let him go back to
the Land of the Living with your photo?</i>

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:01.006
To keep your memory alive? No.

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.551
- You're a coward!
- I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.674
The greatest musician of all time!

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.641
Héctor's the real musician.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:10.261
<i>You're just the guy who murdered him
and stole his songs!</i>

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:11.266
Murdered?

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:15.312
I am the one who's willing to do
what it takes to seize my moment.

01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:17.484
Whatever it takes.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.113
No!

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.492
Miguel!

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.704
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:13.658
<i>Please, please, mi familia.</i>

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:15.626
Murderer!

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:18.087
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one...

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:24.590
<i>Remember me
Though I have to s...Hey!</i>

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:27.551
Look!

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.611
Nice kitty.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:58.544
Put me down! No, please! I beg of you!
Stop! Stop! No!

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.421
No! No!

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:21.525
What did I miss?

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.277
Good boy, Dante!

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:24.779
Miguel!

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:30.155
Héctor! The photo... I lost it!

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.738
<i>It's okay, mijo. It's o...</i>

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:36.074
Héctor! Héctor?

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:38.284
Coco.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.332
No! We can still find the photo.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.538
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.333
No, no. I can't leave you.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:50.096
I promised I'd put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.257
<i>We're both out of time, mijo.</i>

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.849
Oh no! No! She can't forget you!

01:27:57.022 --> 01:28:00.857
I just wanted her to know
that I loved her.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.812
- Héctor!
- You have our blessing, Miguel.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.188
No conditions.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:11.074
<i>No! PapáHéctor, please!</i>

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:16.368
No!

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.794
- Go home.
- I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:50.239
There he is!

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.613
Miguel! Stop!

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.584
<i>- Where have you been?
- I need to see MamáCoco, please.</i>

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:04.416
What are you doing with that...
Give it to me!

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:09.425
Miguel, stop! Miguel! Miguel!

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:14.551
<i>MamáCoco?
Can you hear me? It's Miguel.</i>

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:18.718
<i>I saw your papá. Remember? Papá?</i>

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:25.559
Please! If you forget him,
he'll be gone. Forever.

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:27.435
Miguel, open this door!

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:32.027
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:40.782
<i>See? There he is! Papá!
Remember? Papá?</i>

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:48.297
<i>- Miguel!
- MamáCoco, please! Don't forget him.</i>

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.844
<i>What are you doing to that poor
woman? It's okay, Mamita. It's okay.</i>

01:29:57.976 --> 01:29:59.467
What's gotten into you?

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.980
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:09.564
<i>I'm sorry, Papá.</i>

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:12.776
We're all together now.
That's what matters.

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:14.941
Not all of us.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:20.242
<i>It's okay, Mamita. Miguel,
you apologize to your MamáCoco.</i>

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.079
<i>MamáCoco?</i>

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.582
Well? Apologize!

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:41.764
<i>MamáCoco?
Your papá, he wanted you to have this.</i>

01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:45.475
<i>Mamá, wait!</i>

01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:49.484
<i>Remember me</i>

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.608
<i>Though I have to say goodbye</i>

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.365
<i>Remember me</i>

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.698
<i>Don't let it make you cry</i>

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:03.364
<i>For even if I'm far away</i>

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:09.378
<i>I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you</i>

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.715
<i>Each night we are apart</i>

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.802
<i>Remember me</i>

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:20.806
<i>Though I have to travel far</i>

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:23.597
<i>Remember me</i>

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:27.392
<i>Each time you hear a sad guitar</i>

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:34.570
<i>Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be</i>

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:40.864
<i>Until you're in my arms again</i>

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:48.456
<i>Remember me</i>

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:59.212
<i>Elena? What's wrong, mija?</i>

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:04.221
<i>Nothing, Mamá. Nothing at all.</i>

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:08.604
<i>My papáused to sing me that song.</i>

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.391
<i>He loved you, MamáCoco.</i>

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:15.687
<i>Your papáloved you so much.</i>

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:37.633
I kept his letters.

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:42.547
Poems he wrote me. And...

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.660
<i>Papáwas a musician.</i>

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.071
When I was a little girl...

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:12.998
<i>he and Mamá
would sing such beautiful songs.</i>

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:29.852
And right over here, one of
Santa Cecilia's greatest treasures.

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:33.689
The home of the esteemed song writer,
Héctor Rivera.

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:38.103
The letters Héctor wrote home for
his daughter, Coco, contain the lyrics...

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.818
<i>for all of your favorite songs.
Not just Remember Me.</i>

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:47.870
<i>And that man is your PapáJulio.</i>

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:51.203
<i>And there's Tía Rosita
and your Tía Victoria.</i>

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:54.210
And those two are Oscar and Felipe.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:57.337
These aren't just old pictures,
they're our family...

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:59.544
and they're counting on us
to remember them.

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:22.648
<i>Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool</i>

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:28.698
Enjoy your visit, Héctor.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:33.416
<i>But last night it seemed that
I dreamed about you</i>

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:39.751
<i>- Papá!
- Coco!</i>

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:44.589
<i>When I opened my mouth
what came out was a song</i>

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:50.429
<i>And you know every word
and we all sang along</i>

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:57.724
<i>To a melody played
on the strings of our souls</i>

01:34:57.901 --> 01:35:02.692
<i>And a rhythm that rattled us
down to the bone</i>

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:07.609
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:14.120
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:18.787
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:24.717
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:32.179
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

01:35:32.602 --> 01:35:36.437
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:40.270
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:44.437
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:49.067
<i>Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente</i>

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:52.866
<i>Canten a coro
Let it be known</i>

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:55.034
<i>Our love for each other
will live on forever</i>

01:35:57.001 --> 01:36:01.462
<i>In every beat of my proud corazón</i>
