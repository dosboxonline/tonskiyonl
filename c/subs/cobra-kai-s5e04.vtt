And I would be honored if every one of you

23:02.255 --> 23:06.676

to continue assisting those in need.

-Well, they do sound like a lot of work.

Well, well, well, you finally brought me
something I actually want.

It'll make you feel better.

I already took one. It didn't help.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.224
This job sucks ass, man.
All anyone does is complain.

23:54.307 --> 23:57.352
I drove them to the wrong place,
brought the wrong order,

24:00.814 --> 24:03.358
So… quit?

24:03.442 --> 24:07.612
I want to, but there's a kid on the way.
I got another one I wanna take care of.

24:07.696 --> 24:11.741
-Then there's Miguel.
-Okay. I don't need the whole family tree.

You know, not everybody
gets to do their dream job.

in a pawn shop, let alone own three?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.545
Dealing with the likes of you
is the worst part of my day.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.213
Really? Why don't you quit?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.007
Because it pays the bills.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.093
But most of all,

24:30.177 --> 24:32.596
it allows me time for what matters most.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.181
My family.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.728
-You have a family?
-Three kids. You'll never meet them.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.979
The point is,

24:41.062 --> 24:43.398
once you figure out what matters most,

24:43.482 --> 24:45.525
doing that other stuff
gets a little easier

24:45.609 --> 24:48.487
because you know you're doing it for them.

such an asshole after all.
