Bubbly?

03:37.657 --> 03:39.963
- Lover 650.
- What's that?

03:40.050 --> 03:41.487
Oh.

03:43.619 --> 03:45.186
Fabulous range, yes?

03:45.273 --> 03:47.797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:47.884 --> 03:49.538
What do you think, darling?

03:49.625 --> 03:51.148
Let's get a drink and
see what else they have.

03:51.236 --> 03:52.889
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:52.976 --> 03:53.977
- Thank you.
- Bye.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.590
Small, isn't it?

03:57.677 --> 03:59.548
Here you go, ma'am.
One glass of champagne.

03:59.635 --> 04:01.028
Thanks so much.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.335
Anybody else want
something to drink?

04:03.422 --> 04:05.250
Hmm.

04:05.337 --> 04:07.077
Glad you're enjoying it, ma'am.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.601
Allow me, sir.

04:08.688 --> 04:11.386
- Oh, thank you.
- Pleasure.

04:13.345 --> 04:15.738
It's a nice day out.

04:15.825 --> 04:18.611
There's a whole lot of fine jets
and luxury vehicles out here.

04:18.698 --> 04:20.221
Mm-hmm.

04:20.308 --> 04:21.744
You know, these rich folks like

04:21.831 --> 04:22.702
to leave their keys
in the consoles

04:22.789 --> 04:26.619
for anybody to take 'em.

04:26.706 --> 04:28.098
Very interesting.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.404
I didn't know that.

04:29.491 --> 04:31.580
Very interesting.

04:36.716 --> 04:38.892
Then what happens?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.808
Then there's caviar
and champagne.

04:41.895 --> 04:43.984
Oh, I love this.

04:44.071 --> 04:45.464
Continue.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.727
Well, then I guess, eventually,

04:47.814 --> 04:50.773
we'll just have to
pack up our things

04:50.860 --> 04:53.733
and head off to our
own private island.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.213
Oh, yes, the one
with the fishing dock.

04:56.301 --> 04:58.607
No, no, darling.
The other one.

04:58.694 --> 05:00.479
The one with the garden.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.610
Oh, the herb garden.

05:01.697 --> 05:03.656
Yes, the herb garden.

05:03.743 --> 05:05.397
- Yes, yes.
- It has strawberries.

05:05.484 --> 05:06.528
Yeah, strawberries.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.138
Why we still here?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.662
Let's go.
Mr. Carson.

05:09.749 --> 05:12.273
Oh, Mr. Perez.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.754
It's lovely to
see you in person.

05:14.841 --> 05:16.190
And I just firstly
wanted to thank you

05:16.277 --> 05:18.061
for inviting us.

05:18.148 --> 05:20.325
And also to tell you
that my colleagues

05:20.412 --> 05:22.196
and I are very happy.

05:22.283 --> 05:23.371
Glad to hear it.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.894
- Yes, and this is my--
- Wife.

05:24.981 --> 05:26.722
- Wife.
- Hello.

05:26.809 --> 05:27.897
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

05:27.984 --> 05:29.725
Good to meet you.

05:29.812 --> 05:34.948
So you came all this way you're
not checking out the jets?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.384
Oh, well...

05:36.471 --> 05:39.474
The jets are very nice,
but to be candid,

05:39.561 --> 05:42.521
we're here for the, well,
to see the <i>collezione.</i>

05:42.608 --> 05:46.263
The collection.
The car collection.

05:46.351 --> 05:48.918
Oh. You've heard about that, eh?

05:49.005 --> 05:51.356
- Oh, yes, definitely.
- Oh, yes, we have.

05:51.443 --> 05:53.183
Is it possible?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.751
What do you think?

05:55.838 --> 06:01.148
Well, I suppose since you
did come all this way.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.151
- Ah.
- Wonderful.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.251
Mr. Carson, madame, this
is just a small selection

06:17.338 --> 06:18.687
from my private collection.

06:18.774 --> 06:20.646
Oh.

06:20.733 --> 06:23.779
I find that the most discerning
admirers of private jets

06:23.866 --> 06:27.174
also tend to appreciate
the finest automobiles.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.393
Yes. Oh, look, darling,
a Lamborghini.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.829
Aw.

06:29.916 --> 06:33.398
Yeah, this one is
the SVJ prototype.

06:33.485 --> 06:35.400
- Prototype?
- Look!

06:35.487 --> 06:40.622
It's the Mercedes
SLR 722S Roadster.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.929
Mrs. Carson, I'm impressed.
You know your vehicles.

06:43.016 --> 06:45.061
Yes, she does.

06:45.148 --> 06:47.586
Of course, none of
these are for sale.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.065
Bugatti.
Ooh.

06:49.152 --> 06:50.371
Yes.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.156
The Bugatti Veyron.

06:53.243 --> 06:54.593
Take a wild guess.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.377
Well, guess, darling.
Go ahead.

06:56.464 --> 06:58.292
Mmm, more than a million?

06:58.379 --> 06:59.206
More than a million.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.426
Close, 2.5.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.036
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ooh.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.560
Well, it's
a lovely collection.

07:05.647 --> 07:06.909
Is it true?

07:06.996 --> 07:08.345
Huh?

07:08.433 --> 07:11.218
You know, about the Pagani?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.133
Oh.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.527
Do you have it?

07:15.614 --> 07:18.051
Let's find out, shall we?

07:20.619 --> 07:24.361
Ah.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.235
This one is priceless.

07:28.322 --> 07:32.282
This Saudi gentleman
offered me 20 million.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.806
Did he really?
Ooh.

07:33.893 --> 07:35.024
I didn't
take it, of course.

07:35.111 --> 07:36.939
Uh.

07:37.026 --> 07:40.639
Well, can I ask you
a personal question?

07:40.726 --> 07:43.076
Do you ever drive
these amazing machines?

07:44.469 --> 07:46.209
Well, do you?

07:46.296 --> 07:48.908
That would make them
only depreciate in value.

07:48.995 --> 07:51.476
Ah, I see, I see.

07:51.563 --> 07:53.478
You know, I start
'em up every now and then

07:53.565 --> 07:54.609
to hear their engine.

07:54.696 --> 07:56.829
Ah.

07:56.916 --> 07:59.701
Would you two like to sit in it?

07:59.788 --> 08:02.704
- Could we?
- I adore that.

08:02.791 --> 08:03.879
My heart is racing.

08:03.966 --> 08:05.272
- So exciting!
- Okay, yes, you could.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.795
- You wanna, Yes, you wanna.
- Yes!

08:06.882 --> 08:07.666
I just can't
believe I'm doing this.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.232
Ah.

08:09.319 --> 08:10.625
- You're very special.
- Uh, do you mind?

08:10.712 --> 08:12.409
- All right.
- Go ahead.

08:12.497 --> 08:14.411
Let's see. Oh.

08:14.499 --> 08:15.282
Be careful.

08:18.328 --> 08:20.069
Wow, yes.

08:25.727 --> 08:26.728
Comms out.

08:27.903 --> 08:29.339
<i>Comms out.</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:31.907
Would you mind terribly
if we started the engine

08:31.994 --> 08:34.823
- just to hear it?
- No, I...

08:34.910 --> 08:36.608
Of course.
Just for a second then?

08:36.695 --> 08:39.175
Okay. Yes, thank you.

08:41.134 --> 08:42.483
Wow.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.964
- Feels good, right?
- Yes, yes.

08:45.051 --> 08:46.313
Oh.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.576
Okay, go ahead.
You can turn it off now.

08:48.663 --> 08:49.577
Go ahead, turn it off.

08:49.664 --> 08:50.883
I can't hear you.

08:50.970 --> 08:52.319
I said, you can turn
off the ignition.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.234
I can't hear you.

08:54.321 --> 08:55.670
Turn. Turn off the ignition.
Hit it, Link.

08:55.757 --> 08:57.542
Lights out.
Starting now.

Our fishing dock, strawberries.

Yeah.

10:47.782 --> 10:49.523
- You excited?
- Yeah.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.351

10:51.438 --> 10:52.352
Nothing.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.751
I'm not trying to rain
on any parades here,

10:59.838 --> 11:03.015
but I'm detecting unusual
activity at exit point.

11:03.102 --> 11:04.407
What?

11:04.494 --> 11:06.496
Well, what kind of
unusual activity, Link?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.411
<i>We got company.</i>

11:08.498 --> 11:12.285
We got a helicopter
and it's unlicensed.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.379
That's FBI.

11:19.466 --> 11:21.207
That's FBI.

11:21.294 --> 11:22.774
Shit, um...

11:22.861 --> 11:24.210
<i>It's not looking so good.</i>

11:24.297 --> 11:25.472
<i>Multiple vehicles

11:25.559 --> 11:27.779
- Right.
- Mason.

11:27.866 --> 11:29.476
No, Anton's got this.
Don't worry about it.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.607
I know him.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.671
Mason.

11:50.758 --> 11:52.586
No, Anton will take care
of this, I promise you.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.377
Let's take these boys
for a quick spin, Shawn.

12:10.778 --> 12:12.911
You ready?

12:12.998 --> 12:14.521
Here we go.

12:20.179 --> 12:23.051
Whoa!

12:25.706 --> 12:27.403
Oh, my God!

12:30.624 --> 12:32.321
Hold position.

12:32.408 --> 12:33.496
Watch this.

12:33.583 --> 12:34.497
Go, go, go!

12:34.584 --> 12:36.586
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:36.673 --> 12:39.285
Oh, no!

12:39.372 --> 12:40.590
Damn!

12:45.204 --> 12:47.119
How did they know?

12:47.206 --> 12:48.990
How would the fucking FBI know?

12:49.077 --> 12:50.513
What do you put...

12:59.958 --> 13:01.742
How long?

13:01.829 --> 13:03.352
- Two years?
- Yeah.

13:03.439 --> 13:05.528
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

13:05.615 --> 13:07.661
You could have
busted me any time.

13:07.748 --> 13:09.794
I never had the proper
evidence before.

13:09.881 --> 13:12.492
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

13:12.579 --> 13:14.755
<i>Mason, are you there?</i>

13:14.842 --> 13:18.715
- Yeah.
- Mason, we're going to plan B?

13:18.803 --> 13:20.369
Don't do it, Mason.

13:20.456 --> 13:23.198
- So everything's just--
- Yeah.

13:23.285 --> 13:24.591
All this time.

13:28.638 --> 13:32.033
Man, this helicopter's
all over this bitch.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.687
<i>What's up, Chief?</i>

13:33.774 --> 13:35.210
Wow, you were good.

13:35.297 --> 13:36.342
You were...

13:36.429 --> 13:38.300
What a pro.

13:38.387 --> 13:39.824
I bought it hook,
line, and sinker.

13:39.911 --> 13:42.261
<i>Mason, are you there?</i>

13:42.348 --> 13:44.785
- It's over.
- All right.

13:44.872 --> 13:46.439
Well, you're gonna have
to pull that trigger,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.354
'cause I'm not leaving my team.

13:48.441 --> 13:50.617
I'm not.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.140
We're doing plan B.

13:52.227 --> 13:53.402
Plan B is on.

13:53.489 --> 13:54.795
Fuck.

13:54.882 --> 13:56.579
We're going to plan B.

13:56.666 --> 14:00.148
Plan B? Plan B, all right,
all right, all right.

14:00.235 --> 14:01.628
- Plan B.
- We gotta go to plan B, bro.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.977
We can't go to fucking plan B.

14:03.064 --> 14:04.849
Damn, this shit was going good.

14:04.936 --> 14:06.894
But we've never
done plan B ever.

14:06.981 --> 14:09.027
Mason, you know,
I'm not a great swimmer.

14:18.645 --> 14:20.734
You ready?

14:46.325 --> 14:47.717
Plan B fucking sucks.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.425
I'm good.

14:59.512 --> 15:00.730
I'm okay.

15:03.951 --> 15:05.561
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.964
Come on, Mason, we gotta go.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.014
Link and Hector.

15:23.101 --> 15:25.364
They'll be here in a minute.

15:33.546 --> 15:38.377
Damn! I knew this whole
thing was fucked up.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.640
I can't believe it.

15:40.727 --> 15:43.034
How do you think I feel?

15:44.470 --> 15:45.210
I bought it.

16:00.703 --> 16:07.841
<i>♪ Forever and ever,

16:07.928 --> 16:14.239

16:14.326 --> 16:20.419

16:27.513 --> 16:29.428
Shawn.

16:29.515 --> 16:31.560
What the hell are
you doing here?

16:31.647 --> 16:34.085
You know, I was, uh,
I was in the neighborhood.

16:34.172 --> 16:36.870
Oh, yeah?

16:36.957 --> 16:38.698
How you been?
I missed you.

16:38.785 --> 16:40.787
Okay.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.180
You catch anything?

16:42.267 --> 16:45.661
Yeah, some bass
and some snapper.

16:51.841 --> 16:55.845
What kind of beer
are you drinking?

16:55.932 --> 16:58.848
Now you did not
come all this way

16:58.935 --> 17:01.895
to ask me what kind
of beer I'm drinking.

17:01.982 --> 17:03.853
If you'd check your
messages once in a while.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.465
Well, I'd have to have a
phone to do that, wouldn't I?

17:06.552 --> 17:07.901
Here, hydrate.

17:20.131 --> 17:21.523
Okay, what is it?

17:22.524 --> 17:23.438
Hmm?

17:25.049 --> 17:26.963
Look at you, you're a mess.

17:27.051 --> 17:29.618
Yes, I resemble that remark.

17:30.706 --> 17:32.491
So?

17:32.578 --> 17:34.493
I can't believe you let
a woman do this to you.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.712
She broke you, man.

17:36.799 --> 17:40.020
Your lucky Dad's not
here to see this.

17:40.107 --> 17:41.195
You don't have to
worry about me.

17:41.282 --> 17:42.196
I'm living the life.

17:42.283 --> 17:44.416
Don't you worry.

17:44.503 --> 17:46.722
You're my brother.

17:46.809 --> 17:49.638
Of course, I worry about you.

17:49.725 --> 17:52.641
Okay, so, uh, what is it?
What do you need?

17:52.728 --> 17:54.426
Spit it out.

17:54.513 --> 17:56.080
Hmm?

17:56.167 --> 17:57.472
I might have another
job lined up.

17:57.559 --> 18:00.562
Oh, no,
out of the question.

18:00.649 --> 18:01.824
You gotta get back
in the game, man.

18:01.911 --> 18:03.565
Okay, is it cash?

18:03.652 --> 18:04.827
You know, I have stash.
I'd give it to you.

18:04.914 --> 18:06.742
Just tell me what--

18:06.829 --> 18:09.136
I can't watch you
wither away like this.

18:09.223 --> 18:10.224
We can't let her
get away with this.

18:10.311 --> 18:12.879
It's breaking my heart, okay?

18:12.966 --> 18:14.054
We're the best team
in the business.

18:14.141 --> 18:15.708
We gotta get back in there.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.710
We can't do it without you.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.191
You need to get back to work.

18:20.278 --> 18:21.540
That's what Dad would
say if he was still here.

18:21.627 --> 18:23.629
Dad?

18:23.716 --> 18:26.545
Dad died in an orange jumpsuit.

18:26.632 --> 18:29.809
Old, broken, alone.

18:29.896 --> 18:31.898
No, no, no, no, no.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.247
I'd rather fish.

18:35.075 --> 18:36.468
What about the team?

18:39.427 --> 18:41.081
Anton has a daughter
to put through school.

18:41.168 --> 18:43.344
Link's drowning in crazy debt.

18:45.781 --> 18:47.261
Where you going?

18:47.348 --> 18:49.133
We all knew the risks.

18:51.309 --> 18:53.180
The tide's-- tide's come up.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.098
Here.

18:58.185 --> 19:00.927
In case you change your mind.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.277
Don't worry, it's untraceable.

19:06.889 --> 19:08.674
<i>They never found
the bodies in Miami.</i>

19:08.761 --> 19:09.675
He's out there somewhere.

19:09.762 --> 19:11.677
He means nothing to me.

19:11.764 --> 19:13.374
It was a mistake, okay?

19:16.551 --> 19:20.207
What if I told you we picked up
white chatter in Mason's crew?

19:22.253 --> 19:23.732
You think they're
planning something?

19:36.354 --> 19:39.226
I told you I'm not interested.

19:39.313 --> 19:40.706
<i>Oof, you sound rough.</i>

19:40.793 --> 19:41.707
<i>Everything okay?</i>

19:41.794 --> 19:43.056
Link.

19:43.143 --> 19:44.579
Hey.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.929
What's up?

19:47.016 --> 19:48.148
<i>That's cute.</i>

19:48.235 --> 19:50.324
<i>You're a funny guy.</i>

19:50.411 --> 19:51.369
<i>Wait.</i>

19:51.456 --> 19:53.762
<i>Shawn didn't tell you?</i>

19:53.849 --> 19:54.850
Tell me what?

19:54.937 --> 19:56.939
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

19:57.026 --> 19:58.724
That bad?

19:58.811 --> 20:00.552
<i>It's get
your-ass-on-a-plane bad.</i>

20:00.639 --> 20:02.423
Oh, God.

20:33.846 --> 20:36.414
<i>♪ You're so far away ♪</i>

20:36.501 --> 20:42.637
<i>♪ Like a bright light flashing
through the cloudy skies ♪</i>

20:42.724 --> 20:45.423
<i>♪ I can feel it too ♪</i>

20:48.991 --> 20:50.471
We know each other?

20:50.558 --> 20:52.386
I'm gonna need your finger.

20:54.867 --> 20:56.651
Not that one, your thumb.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.436
I'm waiting for the punch line.

21:00.002 --> 21:03.005
You know that place you manage?

21:03.092 --> 21:05.312
I'm gonna need your
help robbing it.

21:05.399 --> 21:09.316
Oh, you
can't be serious.

21:13.755 --> 21:15.191
I am serious.

21:15.279 --> 21:17.106
And so is my crew.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.326
They're inside ready to gun
down everybody in the bank

21:19.413 --> 21:22.721
unless you do exactly as I say.

21:22.808 --> 21:26.290
So either you give me
your thumb or I take it.

21:37.039 --> 21:38.519
Really, Shawn?

21:38.606 --> 21:40.782
You're late.
I thought you'd be here sooner.

21:40.869 --> 21:43.568
Stop looking around, hide
your gun, and who is this?

21:44.960 --> 21:46.266
It's the bank manager.

21:46.353 --> 21:47.702
- Oh, God.
- Don't worry.

21:47.789 --> 21:49.269
It's an easy one,
it's cut and dry.

21:49.356 --> 21:51.706
If it looks cut and dry,
it's not.

21:51.793 --> 21:53.317
Look, I came to you first,
you said no.

21:53.404 --> 21:54.840
What am I supposed to do?

21:54.927 --> 21:55.754
You brought the crew
in here, didn't you?

21:55.841 --> 21:57.843
- Yeah.
- Okay, where are they?

21:57.930 --> 21:59.323
They're inside.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.628
Look, you can still
turn this around.

22:00.715 --> 22:02.369
- I won't say anything, I swear.
- Liar.

22:02.456 --> 22:05.329
Okay, we're probably being
clocked by 14 cameras right now.

22:05.416 --> 22:06.765
Do you have a plan B?

22:06.852 --> 22:08.332
Don't need a plan B when
plan A is this good.

22:08.419 --> 22:10.072
Okay, this is it, this is it.

22:10.159 --> 22:12.205
Okay. This is the plan.

22:12.292 --> 22:14.250
You and Mr. Manager
are gonna wait outside

22:14.338 --> 22:15.121
while I go get the crew.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.688
What?

22:16.775 --> 22:18.777
Just 'cause it's my plan
and not yours, it's bad?

22:18.864 --> 22:20.387
Stop it. It's not debatable.

22:23.085 --> 22:24.435
Stay here.

22:58.860 --> 23:00.819
I thought you were
slowing him down.

23:00.906 --> 23:02.429
I tried.
You know how you it gets?

23:02.516 --> 23:04.126
Yeah, and why did you
let it get this far?

23:04.213 --> 23:06.128
First, I didn't let it get
this far. It just happened.

23:06.215 --> 23:08.087
And second, I was waiting
for you to stop it.

23:08.174 --> 23:09.828
Yeah, well, we're gonna 86
this thing right now.

23:09.915 --> 23:12.352
There's no reason
why you and Anton

23:12.439 --> 23:14.528
should go down with
my idiot brother.

23:14.615 --> 23:17.313
It might be too late.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.452
You should really
listen to your friend.

23:25.539 --> 23:27.628
Trying to stop you from doing
something really stupid.

23:27.715 --> 23:29.456
Yeah, yeah, whatever, bro.

23:29.543 --> 23:30.849
Just use your fucking thumb.

23:30.936 --> 23:32.067
Come on.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.289
Sorry. Forgot about the retinol.

23:36.376 --> 23:37.464
Hands in the air!

23:37.551 --> 23:38.422
Chill, bro.

23:38.509 --> 23:40.249
Ah!

23:40.336 --> 23:42.208
I said hands in the air!

23:50.346 --> 23:52.305
Fucking drop it.
Get down!

23:53.262 --> 23:56.178
Get on the floor.

23:56.265 --> 23:58.398
Zip-tie his ass up.

24:00.922 --> 24:04.230
Hector, check the doors.
Nobody comes in or out.

24:08.756 --> 24:11.237
Link, cameras.
Anton, crowd control.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.325
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

24:22.117 --> 24:23.510
Ah, fuck.

24:26.252 --> 24:27.645
Go, go, go!

24:27.732 --> 24:30.909
All right, everybody listen up.
Eyes on me.

24:30.996 --> 24:32.476
I ain't come here to play,

24:32.563 --> 24:35.043
and I'm damn sure
ain't bullshitting.

24:35.130 --> 24:38.917
I go by the name of Anton
and that's my dog Hec.

24:39.004 --> 24:40.440
And we the best of the
best at what we do.

24:40.527 --> 24:42.660
Fucking piece of shit.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.010
So if we all cooperate
and act like a team,

24:45.097 --> 24:46.664
this shit will be
over within no time.

24:46.751 --> 24:49.884
Hell, you might even have
a good story to tell.

24:49.971 --> 24:51.451
Ma'am, I need you to sit down.

24:51.538 --> 24:53.540
I can't. I have a bad back.

24:53.627 --> 24:55.499
It's okay, ma'am.
Let me help you.

24:56.891 --> 25:00.329
You know what?

25:04.116 --> 25:06.466
That was uncalled for.

25:06.553 --> 25:08.599
I understand you in a
messed up situation,

25:08.686 --> 25:09.948
but I'ma let it slide,
Miss Lady.

25:12.037 --> 25:15.562
Grandma, sit down.

25:18.478 --> 25:20.872
You pull this bullshit again,
I'll fucking kill you.

25:20.959 --> 25:22.134
Link, where we at?

25:22.221 --> 25:25.616
Going dark in 3, 2, 1.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.445
Move!

25:29.533 --> 25:30.925
Go, go!

25:31.012 --> 25:33.798
What part of it did you
not understand, Shawn?

25:33.885 --> 25:35.756
I told you to
fucking stay outside.

25:35.843 --> 25:37.541
Now what, what are
we looking for?

25:37.628 --> 25:39.368
I'm looking for a
safety deposit box.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.631
One, two, how many?

25:40.718 --> 25:41.457
Just one, that's it.

25:41.545 --> 25:42.502
But what's in it?

25:42.589 --> 25:43.982
A wallet.

25:44.069 --> 25:46.375
- A wallet? A wallet.
- A crypto wallet.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.508
I've been telling you
about crypto forever.

25:48.595 --> 25:49.683
Trust me. This is a big one.

25:49.770 --> 25:51.293
How big?

25:51.380 --> 25:53.208
The biggest
one we've ever done.

25:55.646 --> 25:57.125
Okay, get in.

25:57.212 --> 25:58.692
Okay,
I'm going, I'm going.

25:58.779 --> 26:00.607
I'm looking for 1140.

26:03.175 --> 26:04.959
<i>1140, we're looking for 1140.</i>

26:11.575 --> 26:13.098
Come on. Help us.

26:13.185 --> 26:14.752
I'm looking. I--
This isn't my department.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.449
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:18.407 --> 26:19.583
Go ahead, go, go!

26:24.196 --> 26:26.328
- 1140.
- Okay.

26:26.415 --> 26:27.895
Let's open it.
Come on, come on, guys.

26:27.982 --> 26:30.158
Well, you do have
your keys, don't you?

26:30.245 --> 26:31.856
Shawn?

26:31.943 --> 26:33.379
W-- Why would I need
another key?

26:33.466 --> 26:36.774
You need two keys,
mine and the owners.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.951
Okay. Hey, Link, where are you?

26:40.038 --> 26:41.474
Link.

26:41.561 --> 26:44.477
Could you do a bypass on
the safety deposit box?

26:44.564 --> 26:46.784
<i>It's 1-1-4-0.
Working on it.</i>

26:46.871 --> 26:47.872
I thought we weren't
playing games.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.656
I'm, there's not,
you need two keys.

26:49.743 --> 26:51.397
- I can't do anything about it.
- How are we doing?

26:51.484 --> 26:52.267
<i>Almost there.</i>

27:06.455 --> 27:10.285
You seem pretty calm about this.
You done this before?

27:10.372 --> 27:13.549
Yeah, a few times.
Four to be exact.

27:13.637 --> 27:16.291
Got any interesting stories?

27:16.378 --> 27:17.815
Not really, same ending.

27:18.816 --> 27:20.905
Same ending?

27:20.992 --> 27:24.038
Jail. A few would-be thieves
were shot to death.

27:24.125 --> 27:25.605
About two years ago,
a guy actually made it

27:25.692 --> 27:27.651
out the front door
before they shot him.

27:27.738 --> 27:29.522
Now, that was exciting.

27:40.054 --> 27:41.665
West side.

27:45.059 --> 27:47.453
Affirmative! Check it.

27:49.847 --> 27:54.329
Over to the
west side, all the way.

27:54.416 --> 27:56.984
Guys on the front, two men up.

27:57.071 --> 27:59.639
Two subjects on the move!

28:02.163 --> 28:03.991
Shawn, I gotta ask you.

28:04.078 --> 28:06.472
What, what were you going
to do without a second key?

28:06.559 --> 28:07.778
I brought my drill.

28:07.865 --> 28:10.998
Okay, well that's good. And?

28:11.085 --> 28:13.305
And I-- I learned about
this special Cobalt bit

28:13.392 --> 28:15.350
that drills through anything.

28:15.437 --> 28:19.441
And how did you learn how
to do that, on YouTube?

28:19.528 --> 28:20.878
All your search
history is pretty much

28:20.965 --> 28:22.749
public knowledge these days.

28:22.836 --> 28:24.185
I had it on private mode.

28:24.272 --> 28:26.797
No, there is no
private mode, Shawn.

28:26.884 --> 28:30.365
Okay, what
else is in the bag?

28:30.452 --> 28:33.368
My stethoscope, my goggles,
my C4, all my usual gear.

28:45.380 --> 28:46.860
Okay, what do you got?

28:46.947 --> 28:48.993
<i>We got company.</i>

28:49.080 --> 28:51.996
Holy shit.
They're here early.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.564
They're expecting this.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.871
Okay, what else haven't you
told me? Tell me everything.

28:57.958 --> 28:59.264
Did everything by the book.

28:59.351 --> 29:00.613
Well, they wouldn't
be here early

29:00.700 --> 29:03.181
if you did everything
by the book.

29:03.268 --> 29:05.487
Dammit, Shawn.

29:05.574 --> 29:08.534
You wipe that fucking
grin off your face.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.188
<i>What else? Tell me what
else haven't you told me?</i>

29:10.275 --> 29:13.321
<i>I did
everything by the book.</i>

29:13.408 --> 29:15.715
Override code 1140.

29:15.802 --> 29:17.717
<i>Here we go.</i>

29:17.804 --> 29:20.285
This better be a lot
of fucking crypto.

29:20.372 --> 29:22.504
Trust me. It'll be worth it.

29:28.162 --> 29:29.903
Looks like a little thumb drive.

29:31.296 --> 29:32.950
What the fuck?

29:33.037 --> 29:34.342
Is this the right box?

29:37.041 --> 29:38.738
Fuck!

29:38.825 --> 29:41.132
Fuck, it's supposed to...
Where the fuck is it?

30:16.863 --> 30:18.473
Special Agent Decker, FBI.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.433
This is a local situation.
I didn't request FBI.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.913
I have this handled.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.262
It's a situation
involving criminals

30:24.349 --> 30:26.351
at the top of our
most wanted list.

30:26.438 --> 30:27.961
We didn't even ID anyone yet.

30:28.048 --> 30:29.702
Where you getting this info?

30:29.789 --> 30:30.790
Look, I'm here to help.

30:30.877 --> 30:31.965
- Help?
- Mm-hmm.

30:32.052 --> 30:33.488
In what way?

30:33.575 --> 30:34.402
I'm your negotiator.

30:34.489 --> 30:36.230
Uh, no.

30:36.317 --> 30:37.753
If you wanna look over
my negotiator's shoulder

30:37.841 --> 30:39.190
you're more than welcome.

30:39.277 --> 30:42.497
But I'm in charge here.
I call the shots.

30:42.584 --> 30:44.978
You might wanna check in with
your supervisor about that.

30:49.896 --> 30:51.245
All right, where
are we at, team?

30:51.332 --> 30:52.420
Hey.

30:52.507 --> 30:54.074
Yeah, they just showed up.

30:55.075 --> 30:56.294
Yep.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.458
I don't understand.
This is the box.

31:30.545 --> 31:31.590
It's supposed to
fucking be here!

31:31.677 --> 31:33.505
Calm down.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.507
There-- there's supposed to
be a password and a wallet

31:35.594 --> 31:36.987
- in there worth $600 million.
- Come here, come here.

31:37.074 --> 31:38.553
Come here. Get over here.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.642
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

31:40.729 --> 31:42.383
This is very important.

31:42.470 --> 31:44.820
How did you find out about
this box, this crypto?

31:44.908 --> 31:46.648
How do you think I found it?

31:46.735 --> 31:49.086
I did my research,
I did everything by the book.

31:49.173 --> 31:50.783
I did everything
that we always do.

31:50.870 --> 31:54.352
Who did this crypto belong to?

31:54.439 --> 31:57.268
Yeah, some lady, some like
crazy, rich socialite lady.

31:57.355 --> 31:58.834
Okay, do you remember her name?

32:01.185 --> 32:03.143
Pharaoh, Pharaoh,
Isabelle Pharaoh.

32:03.230 --> 32:04.536
Isabelle Pharaoh.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.755
Now you know
Isabelle Pharaoh, yes?

32:06.842 --> 32:09.149
- No, it doesn't ring a bell.
- Don't fucking lie to me!

32:11.151 --> 32:12.370
Hey, Link, are you listening?

32:12.457 --> 32:13.893
Unfortunately.

32:13.980 --> 32:15.460
Okay, do a background check on--

32:15.547 --> 32:17.505
- what the fuck was her name?
- Isabelle Pharaoh.

32:17.592 --> 32:20.117
Isabelle Pharaoh.
Do the whole gamut.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.728
I just, I don't understand.
It's gotta be in here.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.513
Shawn, it's a decoy box.

32:31.955 --> 32:34.958
Bank robbers are us.
<i>Hey, Link.</i>

32:37.003 --> 32:39.571
- Amy, is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.138
<i>Oh, my God,
it's been forever!</i>

32:41.225 --> 32:44.010
Yeah, I know, right?
How are you?

32:44.097 --> 32:47.361
I've been okay.
How about you, still jogging?

32:47.448 --> 32:49.363
No, I pulled my hip
out a couple weeks back

32:49.450 --> 32:50.408
doing some fieldwork.

32:50.495 --> 32:53.280
Ugh, hate when that happens.

32:53.367 --> 32:54.803
On point for this one?

32:55.587 --> 32:56.675
Sure am.

32:59.373 --> 33:01.723
It just doesn't seem like Mason.

33:04.291 --> 33:05.336
Shawn?

33:07.207 --> 33:09.296
Can I talk to Mason?

33:09.383 --> 33:12.604
<i>Sure, no problem.
One sec.</i>

33:19.219 --> 33:21.526
Uh, Chief?
<i>Yeah?</i>

33:21.613 --> 33:23.832
I got the negotiator
on the line.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.313
Okay. I have to go.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.011
If he moves, you shoot him.

33:40.501 --> 33:42.155
You should probably be
sitting down for this.

33:42.242 --> 33:43.678
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

33:48.466 --> 33:50.033
Go ahead.

33:51.121 --> 33:52.209
<i>Hi, Mason.</i>

33:59.520 --> 34:02.567
- Amy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34:02.654 --> 34:04.438
How are you?

34:04.525 --> 34:07.485
Doing pretty good,
you know, considering.

34:09.530 --> 34:11.271
No, that's a lie.

34:11.358 --> 34:14.100
It's, it's, you know,
pretty crappy to be honest.

34:14.187 --> 34:16.885
But now that I hear
your voice not, not bad.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.150
- Y-you sound really good.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

34:20.237 --> 34:23.109
I-- I've been busting my
ass with this fieldwork.

34:23.196 --> 34:25.459
Oh, yeah?
How's that going?

34:25.546 --> 34:28.419
Good, they promoted me
to the special unit.

34:28.506 --> 34:30.551
<i>Really? Well, that's good.</i>

34:30.638 --> 34:34.338
I'm happy for you.
Couldn't happen
to a better person.

34:34.425 --> 34:38.211
So, uh, I gotta ask,
FBI throwing this party?

34:38.298 --> 34:40.083
Yeah, you're not wrong.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.824
Of course they got you.
Cars were here quick, huh?

34:42.911 --> 34:44.522
You had a head start.

34:44.609 --> 34:45.436
<i>Yeah, we picked up
on the white chatter</i>

34:45.523 --> 34:47.090
<i>a couple weeks back.</i>

34:47.177 --> 34:50.615
Oh, of course, Shawn.
Sloppy.

34:50.702 --> 34:51.616
<i>I, I'm sure
he was just trying</i>

34:51.703 --> 34:54.532
<i>to help you in his own way.</i>

34:54.619 --> 34:59.667
Hey, Amy, I'm,
I'm happy it's you.

34:59.754 --> 35:01.539
Uh, I couldn't help but notice

35:01.626 --> 35:03.584
that your inside
surveillance is dark.

35:03.671 --> 35:04.933
<i>Link did an excellent
job controlling</i>

35:05.020 --> 35:06.457
<i>the seats on your perimeter.</i>

35:06.544 --> 35:09.851
Well, she's the best, isn't she?

35:09.938 --> 35:13.725
Um, I guess we should
get down to business.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.379
<i>Well, okay.</i>

35:15.466 --> 35:17.816
All right, so this is
the part where you say

35:17.903 --> 35:19.209
<i>that, uh, you've got
everything covered.</i>

35:19.296 --> 35:21.385
The entrance, the exits,
you've got tactical,

35:21.472 --> 35:24.214
you've got snipers, you've
got electronic surveillance.

35:24.301 --> 35:28.131
And I in turn tell you that
I've got a bunch of hostages,

35:28.218 --> 35:29.306
and I don't wanna hurt them.

35:29.393 --> 35:30.916
But, you know, if you bust in,

35:31.003 --> 35:32.657
I gotta do blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah

35:32.744 --> 35:35.529
to each and every one
of them, and what's new?

35:35.616 --> 35:37.749
How many hostages?

35:37.836 --> 35:40.708
<i>Twenty-three, if you
include staff and security.</i>

35:40.795 --> 35:43.320
Okay, well, if Anton
is on crowd control,

35:43.407 --> 35:45.583
<i>I'm sure they're in good hands.</i>

35:45.670 --> 35:49.239
Okay, so, uh, I have
a special request.

35:51.415 --> 35:52.938
<i>Okay, shoot.
I'll do my best.</i>

35:53.025 --> 35:55.114
I need 50 feet.

35:55.201 --> 35:57.464
- 50 feet?
- 50 feet.

35:57.551 --> 35:59.031
Why 50 feet?

35:59.118 --> 36:01.033
I mean, that's new.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.730
Oh, I don't know, Amy.

36:02.817 --> 36:05.255
I guess I'm feeling
kind of claustrophobic.

36:05.342 --> 36:07.257
<i>Sides, front of the
building, everyone back,</i>

36:07.344 --> 36:10.521
<i>cops, tacticals, everyone.</i>

36:10.608 --> 36:12.653
<i>Oh, and include the sidewalk.</i>

36:16.570 --> 36:18.616
<i>You know how I get
when I'm in a corner.</i>

36:18.703 --> 36:20.487
<i>What do you
think she's doing?</i>

36:20.574 --> 36:24.143
She's trying
to figure out 50 feet.

36:26.406 --> 36:28.321
<i>She doesn't look that
comfortable in that suit.</i>

36:28.408 --> 36:30.149
<i>It's not her.</i>

36:30.236 --> 36:32.934
<i>Nah, it's not bad.
I kinda like it.</i>

36:33.021 --> 36:34.197
Oh, she looks good.

36:34.284 --> 36:37.025
Oh, she looks great.

36:37.112 --> 36:41.204
And she's got that little
confidence bump in her voice.

36:41.291 --> 36:43.380
Like when she beats you at pool?

36:43.467 --> 36:45.425
No, she never beat me a pool.

36:45.512 --> 36:49.690
But [sighs] she's really doing
well for herself, isn't she?

36:50.735 --> 36:53.520
Wow.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.309
Captain, I'm gonna need a
360 sweep of the perimeter.

36:59.396 --> 37:01.006
All right,
I'll let you negotiate,

37:01.093 --> 37:04.052
but I'm still in charge
of this operation.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.532
And I will let you
keep that narrative

37:05.619 --> 37:07.230
as long as you do what I say.

37:14.411 --> 37:17.544
Sniper 3 in position. 52 feet.

37:24.725 --> 37:29.252
So nothing
in the 50-foot range.

37:29.339 --> 37:31.341
Not nothing.

37:31.428 --> 37:32.864
There's gotta be something or
he wouldn't have asked for it.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.648
All right, there's a
protocol that we follow here,

37:34.735 --> 37:36.607
trade-offs, escalation,
sweat equity.

37:36.694 --> 37:38.130
We make one hour feel like 10.

37:38.217 --> 37:39.740
Then when the sun drops,
we drill hard.

37:39.827 --> 37:43.309
I am aware of the
protocol and so is he.

37:43.396 --> 37:45.268
If you don't think that Mason
is one step ahead of us,

37:45.355 --> 37:46.617
you're a fool.

37:46.704 --> 37:48.532
<i>Mason is a wolf.</i>

37:48.619 --> 37:52.013
<i>He will chew his leg off
to get out of a trap.</i>

37:52.100 --> 37:54.494
Yeah, you and him are
pretty intimate, yeah?

37:54.581 --> 37:56.148
How do I know you're
not helping him?

37:56.235 --> 37:57.541
Why should I trust you?

37:57.628 --> 38:00.544
It is not important
if you trust me.

38:00.631 --> 38:03.068
It's important that
you're superiors do.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.504
Turn that up, please.

38:06.637 --> 38:08.552
<i>I've exclusively
learned the identity</i>

38:08.639 --> 38:10.945
<i>of one of the
alleged bank robbers,</i>

38:11.032 --> 38:13.731
<i>and it's none other than
Mason Andrew Goddard.</i>

38:13.818 --> 38:15.646
<i>My sources confirm
he is the notorious</i>

38:15.733 --> 38:19.258
<i>international criminal,
the Ace of Spades.</i>

38:19.345 --> 38:22.174
Okay, we got black
coffee with ice.

38:22.261 --> 38:24.045
Would you like a, uh,
creamer with that?

38:24.132 --> 38:25.699
We got hazelnut.
We've got vanilla.

38:25.786 --> 38:27.701
Ugh, gross.
That's a joke, right?

38:29.224 --> 38:30.182
What's happening?

38:30.269 --> 38:31.923
The tactical team looks serious.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.492
- Oh, yeah.
- You're not worried?

38:35.579 --> 38:38.364
Nah, that's what
she wants us to be,

38:38.451 --> 38:41.846
worried so we make a
mistake and slip up.

38:41.933 --> 38:45.980
Okay. If there's a decoy box,
there's a hidden account.

38:46.067 --> 38:47.765
I need you to find it.

38:47.852 --> 38:49.419
And what we should
be doing is looking

38:49.506 --> 38:50.942
for our escape route.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.858
No, no, no. That's
what she wants, okay?

38:53.945 --> 38:55.947
We just have to keep
one step ahead of her.

39:00.647 --> 39:02.345
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I'll be right there.

39:02.432 --> 39:04.303
Now listen,
don't overthink this.

39:04.390 --> 39:06.436
Okay? I'll buy you as
much time as you need.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.745
Whoo!

39:11.832 --> 39:14.444
That's it.
Everybody on me, on me.

39:15.836 --> 39:17.838
Look down. Stay to the
right of that wall.

39:17.925 --> 39:20.145
Let's pick
up the pace, people!

39:20.232 --> 39:21.973
Come on. Let's move!

39:22.930 --> 39:24.454
Let's go!

39:24.541 --> 39:26.456
Face down.
Don't look at me, man.

39:26.543 --> 39:28.022
Keep your eyes forward!

39:36.335 --> 39:37.380
Yeah, we're clear here.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.215
Everybody
get comfortable.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.393
We gonna figure out some
food and drinks in a minute.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.873
Get to know each other, relax.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.267
Consider this a vacation
from your busy lives, folks.

39:57.704 --> 40:00.054
- What do you need?
- Food and drinks.

40:00.141 --> 40:01.839
All right.

40:01.926 --> 40:03.971
Me and Hector got this
whole room under control.

40:04.058 --> 40:06.496
- Ain't that right, Hec?
- Yes, sir!

40:08.454 --> 40:11.065
All right, just so you know,
there is a plan.

40:11.152 --> 40:12.502
You the boss.

40:17.158 --> 40:18.464
Are you sure we can't
find something visual?

40:18.551 --> 40:21.032
Just maybe an old security
camera in the lobby?

40:21.119 --> 40:22.468
I mean, anything.

40:22.555 --> 40:23.774
She locked it all down tight.

40:23.861 --> 40:26.341
Landlines, feeds, everything.
She's a pro.

40:26.429 --> 40:27.604
Yeah, I know.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.867
Mossad outsourced her.

40:29.954 --> 40:30.955
All right.

40:31.042 --> 40:33.871
There's 23 hostages.

40:33.958 --> 40:36.961
All of them were smart devices.

40:37.048 --> 40:39.485
But you know, Anton didn't
let them keep any of them on.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.967
But a tech with your skills

40:43.054 --> 40:45.665
could probably turn
one back on remotely.

40:46.666 --> 40:48.189
Yes?

40:48.276 --> 40:51.018
Uh, okay.

40:51.105 --> 40:53.760
Got something here.
One second.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.591
Wait, is that spa music?

40:59.897 --> 41:01.246
Wow.

41:03.857 --> 41:04.771
Brilliant.

41:11.256 --> 41:12.518
Command trailer.

41:14.477 --> 41:15.695
It's for you.

41:18.655 --> 41:20.700
That spa music was a nice touch.

41:20.787 --> 41:23.529
So you can remotely control
someone's personal device.

41:23.616 --> 41:24.704
<i>Isn't that illegal, Amy?</i>

41:24.791 --> 41:26.924
It's a gray area.

41:27.011 --> 41:29.970
Hmm. Can't help but
notice the buildup.

41:30.057 --> 41:32.016
<i>Yeah, the
troops are getting antsy.</i>

41:32.103 --> 41:34.322
Hmm. Yeah, well, we're
antsy in here, too.

41:35.498 --> 41:37.587
Okay, I got a request for you.

41:37.674 --> 41:39.632
That's not fair.
I gave you 50 feet,

41:39.719 --> 41:40.633
you haven't
given me anything.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.548
Nobody's hurt, that's fair.

41:43.767 --> 41:45.029
What do you want?

41:45.116 --> 41:48.467
I want two dozen pizzas.
A mixed variety.

41:48.554 --> 41:50.338
And a Hawaiian for Shawn.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.559
And then for drinks,
let's just do a mix of sodas,

41:53.646 --> 41:58.608
some water, maybe an
apple juice for the kid,

41:58.695 --> 42:00.479
and beer for me.

42:00.566 --> 42:01.872
<i>In under 30 minutes.</i>

42:01.959 --> 42:04.396
- Anything else?
- Yes.

42:06.050 --> 42:09.053
I want you to deliver it.
Alone.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.054
On the steps.

42:10.141 --> 42:12.360
Timer started.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.232
And don't forget the beer.

42:14.319 --> 42:17.365
Beer? Don't you think that's
a little premature?

42:17.452 --> 42:18.845
Have some faith in me, will you?

42:18.932 --> 42:20.760
And I'll see you in
under 30 minutes.

42:39.692 --> 42:41.738
Hey, Shawn.
<i>Yeah?</i>

42:41.825 --> 42:44.218
Check the decoy box, would you?

42:44.305 --> 42:46.786
Look through all the
personal things, like rings,

42:46.873 --> 42:48.179
lockets, whatever.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.397
Just give me any
numbers you find.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.182
Like, any numbers at all.

42:57.188 --> 42:59.973
You knew this was
a decoy box, didn't you?

43:00.060 --> 43:02.062
We got thousands of customers.

43:02.149 --> 43:03.890
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

43:03.977 --> 43:04.848
Yeah, right.

43:10.418 --> 43:13.900
I sense a little tension
between you and your brother.

43:13.987 --> 43:15.032
How do you know he's my brother?

43:15.119 --> 43:17.034
Hey, step back.

43:17.121 --> 43:19.514
- Get back.
- I guessed.

43:19.602 --> 43:21.908
You confirmed it.

43:21.995 --> 43:23.127
You know, I got an
older brother, too.

43:23.214 --> 43:25.520
Bossy.

43:25.608 --> 43:27.914
I simply detest the holiday
get-togethers, because of it.

43:28.001 --> 43:29.786
Yeah, no matter
what I say or do,

43:29.873 --> 43:31.265
he's always got a one-up me.

43:32.745 --> 43:33.659
Yeah, Mason's not like that.

43:35.226 --> 43:38.098
Treats you like a child.

43:38.185 --> 43:39.970
I mean, this was supposed
to be your big score.

43:40.057 --> 43:41.624
Now look, you're
relegated to holding

43:41.711 --> 43:43.756
the bank manager hostage.

43:43.843 --> 43:46.063
I fucked up, I deserve it.

43:46.150 --> 43:48.718
Well, is that what
he makes you think?

43:48.805 --> 43:51.242
Enough! You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about,

43:51.329 --> 43:52.722
all right, bro?

43:52.809 --> 43:53.897
Step the fuck back.

43:57.465 --> 43:58.379
Hey, Link?

43:58.466 --> 44:00.599
<i>Have anything yet?</i>

44:00.686 --> 44:02.383
I think I found your number.

44:03.863 --> 44:07.084
About 24 hostages at this time,

44:07.171 --> 44:10.696
and we're still waiting
for the initial hostages

44:10.783 --> 44:12.611
to be released,
but at this point,

44:12.698 --> 44:14.657
we don't know how
long it's gonna take.

44:19.618 --> 44:22.273
Oop. Here she comes.

44:56.002 --> 44:56.960
Hi there.

44:57.874 --> 44:59.310
Hi.

45:02.879 --> 45:06.709
I'd invite you in, but uh,
a lot of people watching.

45:06.796 --> 45:09.494
There's that, yeah.

45:09.581 --> 45:13.498
Uh, how many crosshairs
am I in right now?

45:13.585 --> 45:16.631
Uh, I'd say about 12.

45:16.719 --> 45:18.677
Hmm, big turnout.

45:18.764 --> 45:19.722
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

45:19.809 --> 45:22.333
You're a popular guy.

45:22.420 --> 45:23.726
Hey, I'm sorry about turning you

45:23.813 --> 45:25.553
into the pizza delivery girl,

45:25.640 --> 45:30.123
but it's the only way
I could do a face-to-face,

45:30.210 --> 45:33.170
you know, just you
and me and of course,

45:33.257 --> 45:35.172
everybody else, but...

45:35.259 --> 45:39.567
So, um, I'm gonna
need two hostages,

45:39.654 --> 45:41.265
non-negotiable, give to get.

45:41.352 --> 45:43.223
Okay.

45:43.310 --> 45:45.399
And then after that,
two every hour.

45:45.486 --> 45:46.661
All right, fine.

45:47.924 --> 45:50.317
You're not even gonna counter?

45:50.404 --> 45:52.363
Why? It's a good, fair deal.

45:53.538 --> 45:55.888
You working out?

45:55.975 --> 45:59.544
Uh, uh, I mean, a, a little bit.

45:59.631 --> 46:01.328
I-- I think it's
just the fieldwork.

46:03.591 --> 46:05.724
You know what would be cool?

46:05.811 --> 46:08.945
If, um, after all this is over,

46:09.032 --> 46:12.252
we went to our
private little island

46:12.339 --> 46:15.995
and you know, the one with the
fishing dock and the garden?

46:20.608 --> 46:23.524
I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

46:23.611 --> 46:26.179
No, you don't have
to worry about that.

46:26.266 --> 46:28.660
But this isn't gonna end well.

46:28.747 --> 46:31.402
Well, maybe, maybe not.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.447
Look, at some point, the
gloves are gonna come off,

46:33.534 --> 46:35.449
and people are gonna get hurt.

46:35.536 --> 46:37.582
Okay, well, first of
all, I did not plan this.

46:37.669 --> 46:38.975
This is Shawn, okay?

46:39.062 --> 46:40.933
And I'm just here
to bail him out.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.195
After what happened with us,

46:42.282 --> 46:44.937
I-- I retired, just so you know.

46:45.024 --> 46:48.027
So just turn yourself in now.

46:48.114 --> 46:49.899
I can't do that.
We'd all go to prison.

46:49.986 --> 46:52.423
Well, it beats dying in
a hailstorm of bullets.

46:52.510 --> 46:53.641
I know about that.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.252
My dad died in prison.

46:55.339 --> 46:57.645
I think he would've
chosen the hailstorm.

46:58.864 --> 47:00.692
I need my two hostages.

47:02.650 --> 47:04.522
And I need my pizza.

47:21.974 --> 47:23.628
All right, pizzas, pizza, man.
Let's go.

47:23.715 --> 47:25.630
Cold or hot, eat it.

47:25.717 --> 47:27.545
Just put it in your damn
stomach and shut up.

47:51.047 --> 47:54.311
Honey, you wanna go home?
Please.

48:05.583 --> 48:09.456
<i>...that two of the
hostages have been released.</i>

48:09.543 --> 48:11.719
<i>Two hostages
have been released.</i>

48:11.806 --> 48:14.722
<i>Negotiators are...</i>

48:14.809 --> 48:16.289
Okay, what do you got?

48:16.376 --> 48:18.770
So, I threw 2-1-3-4
into the algorithm,

48:18.857 --> 48:20.337
and you're never
gonna believe this.

48:20.424 --> 48:21.860
Oh, you gotta match.

48:21.947 --> 48:23.731
Yes, to Isabelle Pharoah.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.996
Of course, it's dark,
standard web security stuff,

48:27.083 --> 48:28.432
but you know, without the
number, you won't find the name.

48:28.519 --> 48:30.347
- Yeah, yeah, this is good.
- Yeah.

48:30.434 --> 48:31.870
Shawn, this is good.

48:31.957 --> 48:34.786
Just, just find the box 2-1-3-4.

48:34.873 --> 48:37.354
<i>I'm telling you,
there is no 2-1-3-4 here.</i>

48:37.441 --> 48:38.703
<i>All the boxes begin with one.</i>

48:40.835 --> 48:41.924
Okay, you know what?

48:42.011 --> 48:43.360
I-- I think it's time for me

48:43.447 --> 48:45.144
to have a little talk
with Mr. Manager.

48:45.231 --> 48:47.233
Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep.

49:04.990 --> 49:07.166
<i>Boss, we got a
problem in the vault.</i>

49:19.483 --> 49:20.571
Shawn?

49:23.052 --> 49:24.140
What the fuck's going on?

49:24.227 --> 49:25.706
Where did he go?

49:25.793 --> 49:27.273
He bolted.

49:27.360 --> 49:31.408
- Where's your gun?
- He took it.

49:31.495 --> 49:33.149
When have I ever
shot anybody, Mason?

49:33.236 --> 49:34.411
Well, I'm not talking
about in the head.

49:34.498 --> 49:35.934
Oh, get up.

49:36.021 --> 49:38.371
The leg or the arm or something.

49:42.897 --> 49:43.898
<i>Link, heads up.</i>

49:43.986 --> 49:45.639
<i>We need a full lockdown.</i>

49:45.726 --> 49:48.860
<i>Roll back the
surveillance on the vault.</i>

49:48.947 --> 49:50.253
I'm already on it.

49:54.300 --> 49:55.780
Lost him in the free elevator.

49:55.867 --> 49:57.651
He's heading to the
roof and he's armed.

49:57.738 --> 50:00.002
Proceed with caution.

50:20.370 --> 50:22.067
You're gonna hold this
against me, aren't you?

50:24.548 --> 50:27.029
I'm not saying anything.

50:28.421 --> 50:30.032
That's a yes.

51:09.375 --> 51:11.812
<i>Link, lights on.</i>

51:50.808 --> 51:55.508
Shawn.

52:06.215 --> 52:08.478
Link, southeast door, lock it.

52:19.184 --> 52:20.359
Well, that was invigorating.

52:23.667 --> 52:24.494
Drop the gun.

52:25.843 --> 52:28.106
Drop the fucking gun.

52:28.193 --> 52:29.412
I'm not Shawn, are you sure?

52:41.859 --> 52:43.904
All right.

52:43.991 --> 52:47.517
Take us to security box 2-1-3-4.

52:47.604 --> 52:50.215
It's not a box.

52:52.696 --> 52:54.263
Very few people know that
the building next door

52:54.350 --> 52:55.742
is part of the bank.

52:55.829 --> 52:58.528
It's for our special accounts.

52:58.615 --> 53:00.051
It's location is a secret

53:00.138 --> 53:01.835
even to the account
holders themselves,

53:01.922 --> 53:04.447
so they can't be blackmailed.

53:04.534 --> 53:06.753
Okay, so how do
we get over there?

53:06.840 --> 53:08.625
You walk down the sidewalk.

53:08.712 --> 53:11.367
Okay.

53:11.454 --> 53:13.369
You're gonna find another
way for us to get there.

53:15.022 --> 53:17.460
Please, I'm begging you.

53:17.547 --> 53:18.765
Abandon this now
while you still can.

53:18.852 --> 53:21.768
I-- I got a family.

53:21.855 --> 53:23.770
We-- we don't want to hurt you.

53:23.857 --> 53:26.077
All we want is this
woman's crypto account.

53:26.164 --> 53:27.557
That's it.

53:27.644 --> 53:29.776
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

53:29.863 --> 53:31.822
When he finds out
what's happening,

53:31.909 --> 53:33.606
he's gonna kill everybody
in this building

53:33.693 --> 53:34.868
to protect that account.

53:34.955 --> 53:36.305
Who?

53:37.610 --> 53:39.525
Abel Salazar.

53:41.484 --> 53:42.963
Really?

53:43.050 --> 53:45.879
The-- the Abel Salazar?

53:45.966 --> 53:47.577
The billionaire who
funded all those coups,

53:47.664 --> 53:48.969
toppled three governments?

53:49.056 --> 53:50.797
Yeah.

53:50.884 --> 53:53.452
And his mistress
is Isabelle Pharoah.

54:01.591 --> 54:03.636
We're dead.
I'm not following.

54:03.723 --> 54:05.638
It's a dirt box.

54:05.725 --> 54:07.597
It's-- it's-- it's the most
powerful people in the world

54:07.684 --> 54:10.208
have their dirty little
secrets in there.

54:10.295 --> 54:11.818
And I'm telling you,

54:11.905 --> 54:14.299
it's the most serious
leverage imaginable.

54:16.345 --> 54:17.868
How do you know there's
real dirt in there?

54:17.955 --> 54:20.653
Because nobody bothers
to go to this level

54:20.740 --> 54:23.526
of hiding things unless
it's all fucked up.

54:23.613 --> 54:27.094
And that-that decoy
with the mistress,

54:27.181 --> 54:28.705
I don't know why the fuck
they trusted this guy with it,

54:28.792 --> 54:30.620
for God's sakes.
And look at this.

54:30.707 --> 54:33.710
Our fan base is big,
but not that big.

54:33.797 --> 54:38.497
Oh, man.
If, if I'm wrong, we're dead.

54:38.584 --> 54:41.718
And if I'm right,
we call the shots.

54:43.023 --> 54:44.677
And we get the crypto.

54:44.764 --> 54:46.505
We're gonna
need the schematics.

54:46.592 --> 54:47.767
Schematics?
You have the schematics.

54:47.854 --> 54:49.595
You do.

54:49.682 --> 54:53.033
Yes, in our system, we do.

55:32.203 --> 55:34.727
Agent Decker.
- Who's asking?

55:34.814 --> 55:36.555
I'd like to speak with you.

55:36.642 --> 55:38.209
So talk.

55:38.296 --> 55:39.471
Alone, please.

55:42.605 --> 55:43.562
I'll be back.

55:45.347 --> 55:46.957
Remind me again.
You are?

55:48.045 --> 55:50.395
Mr. Flowers.

55:50.482 --> 55:51.788
My client has a
personal interest

55:51.875 --> 55:54.530
in this particular
establishment and uh, well,

55:54.617 --> 55:56.793
he's concerned.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.664
Who's your client?

55:58.751 --> 56:00.840
Your superior knows who he is.

56:00.927 --> 56:02.799
Well, there's no
need to be concerned.

56:02.886 --> 56:04.757
I have everything under control.

56:04.844 --> 56:08.021
Is there some reason you haven't
breached the building yet?

56:08.108 --> 56:10.807
Yeah, they've been returning
hostages on schedule.

56:10.894 --> 56:13.331
No one's been hurt.
I have no reason to.

56:13.418 --> 56:16.029
My client's only concern is
the security of his property.

56:16.116 --> 56:18.771
No one is getting
out of that building

56:18.858 --> 56:20.947
with your client's property.

56:21.034 --> 56:23.385
Perhaps you don't get
my gist, Agent Decker.

56:23.472 --> 56:25.212
Secure this establishment now

56:25.299 --> 56:27.780
or there will be an avalanche.

56:27.867 --> 56:31.262
And as you're aware,
avalanches are about gravity.

56:31.349 --> 56:34.787
You either get outta the
way or you get buried alive.

56:34.874 --> 56:36.920
Why don't you make a call to
Agent Richter if you have to?

56:37.007 --> 56:39.270
Have him provide you
a little more context.

56:39.357 --> 56:42.534
But please, for your sake,
don't take too long.

56:48.932 --> 56:52.457
Let's go.

56:52.544 --> 56:54.807
Link, speak up.
Where, where do we go?

56:54.894 --> 56:57.680
- Straight ahead.
- Straight ahead, go.

56:57.767 --> 56:59.638
Then what?
<i>Second pole,
take a left.</i>

56:59.725 --> 57:01.510
Second pole, make a left.
Go ahead.

57:01.597 --> 57:03.468
<i>All right.</i>

57:03.555 --> 57:05.862
On the far wall that's your end
to the neighboring building,

57:05.949 --> 57:07.385
X marks the spot.

57:07.472 --> 57:08.517
- This it?
- Yeah.

57:08.604 --> 57:09.953
- Link?
- Yeah.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.737
Okay, it's plastic.
What do you got?

57:11.824 --> 57:13.870
- It's drywall. I got my mallet.
- Good.

57:13.957 --> 57:15.654
See, I bet you're glad I
brought my equipment now, huh?

57:15.741 --> 57:17.656
I'm very, very proud of you now.
Now, let's go.

57:17.743 --> 57:18.831
- Okay, stand back.
- Okay.

57:18.918 --> 57:20.267
I won't let you down, I promise.

57:20.354 --> 57:21.660
I know, I know.
Just do it.

57:40.287 --> 57:41.506
Get in.
Go ahead.

57:45.118 --> 57:46.685
You're next.

57:46.772 --> 57:49.340
- Come on.
- Yeah, coming.

57:55.085 --> 57:56.478
Shit.

57:56.565 --> 57:57.653
It's a fucking brick wall.

57:57.740 --> 58:00.569
Link, what do we do with this?

58:00.656 --> 58:02.614
<i>Yo, boss,
it's time for the hostages.</i>

58:06.444 --> 58:08.707
Shawn, get your gun out.

58:08.794 --> 58:10.927
You get in the corner.
Right now.

58:11.014 --> 58:12.929
Now listen, he moves,
you fucking shoot him.

58:13.016 --> 58:14.365
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

58:14.452 --> 58:16.454
I'm not kidding.
I'll be right back.

58:16.541 --> 58:18.195
Hostage coming out!

58:18.282 --> 58:19.413
Go ahead. Go.

58:19.501 --> 58:20.719
Go.

58:25.071 --> 58:26.595
Anton.

58:26.682 --> 58:27.639
- Yeah, Chief.
- I need two more.

58:27.726 --> 58:29.293
Who are the medication people?

58:30.337 --> 58:31.382
You, come. Now.

58:31.469 --> 58:32.905
Let's go, let's go.

58:32.992 --> 58:34.733
- Yo, get up, get up, get up.
- Come on.

58:34.820 --> 58:36.300
Quick, quick.

58:40.173 --> 58:41.610
Okay, who's next on the list?

58:41.697 --> 58:43.873
Two college girls
with the final exams.

58:43.960 --> 58:45.135
Okay, bring
'em, bring 'em.

58:45.222 --> 58:45.962
- Get 'em.
- Let's go. Come on.

58:48.617 --> 58:49.661
Quicker, move.

58:55.232 --> 58:57.060
Two more coming out!
Hold your fire.

58:57.147 --> 58:58.278
Two more coming out.

59:01.455 --> 59:03.327
Through this way.
Let's go, let's go.

59:03.414 --> 59:05.547
DRD in position.
Get 'em over to medical.

59:05.634 --> 59:06.896
Eyes on the engine.
Coming through.

59:23.608 --> 59:24.566
Okay.

59:46.762 --> 59:49.591
Let's go.
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

59:58.121 --> 59:58.991
Ah.

01:00:00.036 --> 01:00:00.863
Ah.

01:00:02.038 --> 01:00:03.256
Woo.

01:00:07.086 --> 01:00:11.264
Look, you gotta
tell me something.

01:00:11.351 --> 01:00:13.658
Who else have you ever
talked to about this?

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.358
<i>Who told you about this job?</i>

01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:21.057
You remember my
friend Al from L.A.?

01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:23.581
He's a good guy.
You met him before.

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:27.629
Yeah, Al's the one who was in
San Quentin for 10 years, yes?

01:00:27.716 --> 01:00:30.719
Yeah, hey, he must have got out.

01:00:30.806 --> 01:00:32.721
Why are you interrogating
me about this?

01:00:32.808 --> 01:00:36.420
<i>Oh, God, I gotta
make a call, keep digging.</i>

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:38.727
Hey, are you Decker?
- Yeah.

01:00:38.814 --> 01:00:39.597
Um, he asked me to
give this to you.

01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:41.338
He-- he said it was plan B.

01:00:41.425 --> 01:00:42.861
Thank you.

01:00:42.948 --> 01:00:47.387
Hey.

01:00:47.474 --> 01:00:50.739
Amy, I knew you were ruthless,
but not this ruthless.

01:00:50.826 --> 01:00:52.262
What are you talking about?

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.525
<i>You used Al to
get to my brother.</i>

01:00:54.612 --> 01:00:55.918
Al?

01:00:56.005 --> 01:00:57.484
Yes, you got him
outta prison early.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:59.443
Then he talked my
brother into this gig.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.401
<i>That is not
what's happening.</i>

01:01:01.488 --> 01:01:04.230
Then why this box?
Amy, this box.

01:01:04.317 --> 01:01:05.405
<i>You want to get us all killed?</i>

01:01:05.492 --> 01:01:07.930
No, of course not.

01:01:08.017 --> 01:01:10.759
Mason, I've been honest
with you this entire time.

01:01:10.846 --> 01:01:12.630
Oh, really, how about Miami?

01:01:12.717 --> 01:01:14.588
Was it, was that real?

01:01:14.676 --> 01:01:16.460
Yes, I mean, most of it.

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:18.984
Obviously not the job part,
but the rest of it, yes.

01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:20.725
<i>And how about now?</i>

01:01:20.812 --> 01:01:23.119
Mason, I swear to you,

01:01:23.206 --> 01:01:26.122
I don't know anything
about this box.

01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:27.993
<i>Oh, you don't know that,</i>

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.778
that this was Salazar's
mistress' box?

01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:31.214
You didn't know that?

01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:34.913
Abel Salazar?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.525
Yes, yes, you directed it
right to, right to his dirt box.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.397
<i>Okay, I'm gonna have
to call you right back.</i>

01:01:42.878 --> 01:01:44.531
Oh, fuck.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.273
Decker.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.059
You set them up and
you used me to do it.

01:01:50.146 --> 01:01:51.930
If I had told you everything,

01:01:52.017 --> 01:01:53.497
<i>would you have gone
through with it?</i>

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:55.455
No, no, of course not.

01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:57.806
Exactly, my point has been made.

01:01:57.893 --> 01:01:59.285
What is in the box?

01:02:01.244 --> 01:02:02.071
Hold on.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.340
I am not at liberty to
divulge that information

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:12.603
at this point in time,
but what I can tell you

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:15.084
<i>is that it's much bigger
than you can imagine.</i>

01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:16.563
Okay, if this is so big,

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.175
then why didn't we
just confiscate it?

01:02:19.262 --> 01:02:21.177
<i>Salazar's lawyers
are the best.</i>

01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:22.787
As soon as they would've
found out that we knew,

01:02:22.874 --> 01:02:24.093
they would've blocked
all legal channels,

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.617
and the box would've
magically disappeared.

01:02:26.704 --> 01:02:30.752
Vern, Salazar's liaison
contacted me, Mr. Flowers.

01:02:30.839 --> 01:02:33.711
They are not messing around.
They wanna kill all of them.

01:02:33.798 --> 01:02:35.974
<i>Let's just hope
it doesn't get to that.</i>

01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:37.889
But can you just shorten
his leash a little?

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:39.586
Give me some time!

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.501
Unfortunately, that
time's already passed.

01:02:41.588 --> 01:02:43.286
Mr. Salazar's already
already gone over my head.

01:02:43.373 --> 01:02:44.983
How can that be?

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:46.550
The fucking corrupt CIA.

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:48.770
They've activated joint
special operations.

01:02:48.857 --> 01:02:51.511
This will be under military
jurisdiction by nightfall.

01:03:11.096 --> 01:03:13.185
Link, where we going?

01:03:13.272 --> 01:03:15.753
<i>Straight ahead,
follow the corridor 20 meters.</i>

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.537
Go straight.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.455
Now we checked up
the road here, Sarge!

01:03:28.635 --> 01:03:29.723
Right.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.917
Okay, straight, straight.

01:03:49.004 --> 01:03:49.918
Come on, come on.

01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:52.529
This is the wall. Here.

01:04:16.161 --> 01:04:17.510
That's right.

01:04:22.385 --> 01:04:24.430
All right, keep going,
keep going.

01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:32.612
What do we got?

01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:34.440
It's a steel plate
in the middle.

01:04:34.527 --> 01:04:35.441
It's gonna take
a while to drill.

01:04:35.528 --> 01:04:36.965
Can we use a C4?

01:04:37.052 --> 01:04:38.618
No, no, that's too
much attention.

01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:39.968
You got the cobalt drill?

01:04:40.055 --> 01:04:41.883
- Yeah.
- Use that.

01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:06.690
What do you got?

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:08.648
They're taking over, JSOC.

01:05:08.735 --> 01:05:10.172
I can try to stall them,

01:05:10.259 --> 01:05:12.174
but Salazar went over
everybody's head.

01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:15.003
Special Ops, huh?

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.527
<i>Yes, but it is not worth
losing your life over.</i>

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:19.137
I mean, turn yourself in

01:05:19.224 --> 01:05:21.009
while I still have
power to protect you.

01:05:21.096 --> 01:05:24.795
Let me be your plan B, be smart.

01:05:24.882 --> 01:05:27.319
When have I ever been smart?

01:05:27.406 --> 01:05:30.714
Just let me know
how I can help you.

01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:35.240
You can contact all your
media buddies, make 'em sweat.

01:05:35.327 --> 01:05:37.460
I can try. I mean, it's gonna
take some time.

01:05:37.547 --> 01:05:39.462
I-- I can't make any promises.

01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:41.203
Oh, I believe in you.

01:06:03.616 --> 01:06:04.878
Um, Mason?

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.973
Commander Cyrus, JSOC.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.410
Commander Cyrus, they are
still releasing hostages.

01:06:14.497 --> 01:06:16.194
This has been a
peaceful transaction.

01:06:16.281 --> 01:06:18.022
The FBI has conceded
their authority,

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:21.983
and this operation is
under my jurisdiction now.

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:25.595
Sit tight, I should have this
wrapped up inside the hour.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:26.944
Connect me to the
bank's main line.

01:06:27.031 --> 01:06:29.033
You got it, sir.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.861
You're welcome to stay,
but just get out of our way.

01:06:39.478 --> 01:06:40.784
Go.

01:06:46.355 --> 01:06:49.314
Whoever you are,
you're too damn close.

01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:53.057
My name is Cyrus,
Commander Special Ops.

01:06:53.144 --> 01:06:55.755
Conciliation is no
longer an option,

01:06:55.842 --> 01:06:59.542
and negotiations are over.
Am I making myself clear?

01:06:59.629 --> 01:07:03.198
Special Ops, whoa, we really
hit a nerve here, didn't we?

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.765
You're going to release
the remaining hostages.

01:07:05.852 --> 01:07:07.767
They will exit the
bank in a single file.

01:07:07.854 --> 01:07:09.726
And whenever I give the signal,

01:07:09.813 --> 01:07:13.599
<i>you and your crew will follow,
hands in the air.</i>

01:07:13.686 --> 01:07:15.427
Hands in the air?

01:07:15.514 --> 01:07:18.256
Well, how are we supposed
to put hands in the air,

01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:20.737
<i>and-- and push a--
a wheelbarrow?</i>

01:07:20.824 --> 01:07:22.652
Wheelbarrow?

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.262
<i>Yeah, a wheelbarrow
full of all the--</i>

01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:27.483
<i>the dirt that we found.</i>

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.137
<i>That's why you're here,
aren't you,</i>

01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:31.965
because Salazar
pulled some strings?

01:07:32.053 --> 01:07:36.100
Leave everything inside the bank

01:07:36.187 --> 01:07:38.233
exactly where you found it.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.236
In precisely 15 minutes from
the second that this call ends,

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:44.630
we are coming in with
extreme prejudice.

01:07:44.717 --> 01:07:46.458
Okay, I'm not the
smartest guy in the world,

01:07:46.545 --> 01:07:50.114
but I know a threat
when I hear one.

01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:52.029
So this is my counter to you.

01:07:52.116 --> 01:07:54.466
Okay, do you have a pen?

01:07:54.553 --> 01:07:56.860
Okay, good, are,
are you listening?

01:07:56.947 --> 01:07:59.819
Good, okay, first word, fuck.

01:07:59.906 --> 01:08:01.299
<i>Second word, you.</i>

01:08:02.605 --> 01:08:04.302
You'll regret that.

01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:07.088
<i>Not as much as Salazar.
Check your six o'clock.</i>

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.615
Well, there you have it, folks.

01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:16.619
This is Jennifer Tish with the
Channel 13 News, stay tuned.

01:08:19.578 --> 01:08:21.276
Hello, folks,
we're live downtown.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.713
There has been an escalation
of police presence.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.583
Tensions are growing.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:31.634
<i>Wow, wow, boy, old
Sal won't like that.</i>

01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:35.507
I hope you brought
enough popcorn for all of us.

01:08:35.594 --> 01:08:36.769
The timer begins now.

01:08:37.553 --> 01:08:39.468
Okay.

01:08:52.959 --> 01:08:54.439
Look at this.

01:09:01.664 --> 01:09:04.493
Wow [chuckles], amazing.

01:09:08.584 --> 01:09:10.107
Wow.

01:09:13.676 --> 01:09:15.025
Wow.

01:09:17.506 --> 01:09:20.335
Link, we need you
down here right away.

01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:25.514
So proud of you.

01:09:25.601 --> 01:09:27.298
Yeah, right.
- I really am.

01:09:28.473 --> 01:09:29.735
Come on, let's go.

01:09:34.262 --> 01:09:35.785
One more thing before y'all go.

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.962
Seriously, you guys
has been the best,

01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:41.486
I mean, the best hostages

01:09:41.573 --> 01:09:44.402
I ever had the pleasure
of working with.

01:09:44.489 --> 01:09:45.969
It's been a honor.

01:09:46.056 --> 01:09:48.189
I'd like to say thank you.

01:09:48.276 --> 01:09:49.581
Anything you wanna add, Hec?

01:09:49.668 --> 01:09:51.322
Nah, you covered it, homeboy.

01:09:51.409 --> 01:09:52.541
Let's get 'em out.

01:09:53.672 --> 01:09:54.847
Let's go, come on!

01:09:54.934 --> 01:09:57.415
Two at a time!

01:09:57.502 --> 01:09:59.112
Clear it out!
Hostages coming out!

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.592
We got more coming out.

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:01.637
Let's go, come on, come on!

01:10:01.724 --> 01:10:02.899
Keep it moving!

01:10:04.422 --> 01:10:05.336
Let's go!

01:10:05.423 --> 01:10:06.772
Two more coming out.

01:10:06.859 --> 01:10:07.817
Come on, get your
little midget ass

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.253
out here, motherfucker!

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.428
Let's go, Jheri Curl,
motherfucker!

01:10:10.515 --> 01:10:11.429
Got two more coming out!

01:10:11.516 --> 01:10:13.605
Move, move!

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:16.042
Last two rent-a-cops,
last two rent-a-cops!

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:18.131
Let's go, come on!

01:10:18.219 --> 01:10:19.785
Atta girl, there you go.

01:10:19.872 --> 01:10:22.658
- There you go.
- Hold fire!

01:10:25.965 --> 01:10:27.315
81.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:31.797
Ah, 81, 81, 81, 81, 81.

01:10:31.884 --> 01:10:33.146
There it is.

01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:37.455
It's a hard drive.

01:10:38.543 --> 01:10:40.632
That's it?

01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:43.244
This is Mr. Salazar's
personal drive, correct.

01:10:43.331 --> 01:10:44.984
Is the crypto wallet in there?

01:10:46.595 --> 01:10:47.335
No, Shawn, this is a
private server farm,

01:10:47.422 --> 01:10:49.337
a private cloud for the elite.

01:10:49.424 --> 01:10:50.381
Okay, we gotta upload
this right away.

01:10:50.468 --> 01:10:52.905
- How long will it take?
- Um, 10 minutes.

01:10:52.992 --> 01:10:54.690
We don't have 10 minutes.
Let's go, let's do it.

01:10:54.777 --> 01:10:55.778
I'm on it.

01:10:58.694 --> 01:11:01.262
My family's lives are
in your hands now.

01:11:16.451 --> 01:11:18.148
<i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:21.369
Hey, listen, um,
I got one last request.

01:11:21.456 --> 01:11:23.022
<i>I'm listening.</i>

01:11:23.109 --> 01:11:26.025
When this is all over,
take care of my crew.

01:11:26.112 --> 01:11:27.897
Make sure that they're
in FBI custody.

01:11:29.768 --> 01:11:34.643
I'm sorry, I-- I can't.
I can't do that.

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:36.514
They've
leapfrogged my authority.

01:11:38.473 --> 01:11:40.301
Come on, you're smarter than me.

01:11:40.388 --> 01:11:41.563
You'll think of something.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.741
You said... "my crew."

01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:50.920
What about you?

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:53.923
I'm just gonna wait for you
and meet you at the island,

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.882
share a bucket of beer,
talk about nothing.

01:11:58.928 --> 01:12:00.408
Yeah, I'd really like that.

01:12:04.325 --> 01:12:05.717
I need the name of that--

01:12:05.804 --> 01:12:07.763
that man who approached
you from Salazar.

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:09.242
What was his name?

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:10.766
Mr. Flowers.

01:12:10.853 --> 01:12:12.202
Oh, that's a cute name.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.945
That's what he gave me.

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:21.167
Okay, Amy, take care of my
crew and take care of yourself.

01:12:46.323 --> 01:12:48.586
Standby, all clear,
resuming operations.

01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:58.161
That's it, you the last one,
Mr. Caras, you ready?

01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:08.911
Hostage coming out, last one!

01:13:08.998 --> 01:13:10.347
Let's go.

01:13:15.483 --> 01:13:17.485
Hold your fire!
Hostage coming out!

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:19.400
He's coming out, move, move!

01:13:30.193 --> 01:13:31.934
About five minutes.

01:13:32.021 --> 01:13:32.978
<i>Just give me a minute.</i>

01:13:35.241 --> 01:13:38.375
Okay, we're gonna do
this one at a time.

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:40.508
You know the dance,
your hands up in the air.

01:13:40.595 --> 01:13:43.902
Don't do any sudden movements.
And play the cameras,

01:13:43.989 --> 01:13:45.295
'cause I need all
the time I can get.

01:13:45.382 --> 01:13:46.688
Stretch it out.

01:13:48.516 --> 01:13:52.215
Okay, so who wants to be first?

01:14:00.615 --> 01:14:01.703
I'll go.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:03.661
Okay.

01:14:08.492 --> 01:14:09.580
All right, brother.

01:14:21.287 --> 01:14:22.811
Be safe out there, Hec.

01:14:22.898 --> 01:14:24.465
You're a real one.

01:14:26.249 --> 01:14:28.120
I'll be all right.

01:14:28.207 --> 01:14:30.383
All right, fellas.

01:14:33.952 --> 01:14:36.651
Coming out!

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.087
Both hands, both hands!

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:41.220
Let me see your hands,
both of 'em!

01:14:41.307 --> 01:14:43.571
Turn around and
face the building!

01:14:43.658 --> 01:14:46.791
Face the building!

01:14:46.878 --> 01:14:48.663
Start walking backwards
to the sound of my voice!

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.055
Keep coming!

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.233
Get on your knees now!

01:15:12.338 --> 01:15:13.775
Guess I'm next.

01:15:18.823 --> 01:15:19.650
Shawn.

01:15:22.914 --> 01:15:23.698
This is it.

01:15:27.919 --> 01:15:30.095
It's been a hell
of a ride, Chief.

01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:32.184
Proud to be in this gang.

01:15:32.271 --> 01:15:33.969
You take care of
yourself, Anton.

01:15:34.056 --> 01:15:35.623
You know it.

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:39.365
Damn.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.106
Coming out,
don't shoot me, man!

01:15:42.368 --> 01:15:43.935
Coming out!

01:15:44.022 --> 01:15:45.633
Let's see your hands!

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.330
Both of 'em, both hands!
All right!

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:49.985
Step out, face the building!

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.643
Keep coming,
go down to your knees!

01:15:56.513 --> 01:15:58.080
Down to your knees!

01:16:14.662 --> 01:16:17.795
I'm so sorry about all of this.

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:19.971
I know.

01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:22.626
I can't believe I
got played so bad.

01:16:22.713 --> 01:16:25.237
Well, happens to the best of us.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.807
Hmm, ever since Dad went
away, you're all I have.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.462
You're the world to me.

01:16:34.638 --> 01:16:38.120
I hated seeing you so down.

01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:40.644
This is the most alive I've
seen you in a long time.

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:46.476
- I love you, bro.
- I love you, too.

01:16:53.222 --> 01:16:57.705
Okay, all right,
you take care of yourself.

01:16:57.792 --> 01:16:59.184
You hear me?
Mm-hmm.

01:16:59.271 --> 01:17:00.490
I'll see you on the other side.

01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:03.449
Coming out!

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:07.715
- Coming out!
- Both hands!

01:17:07.802 --> 01:17:10.195
Both hands, both of 'em!

01:17:10.282 --> 01:17:11.806
Both hands!

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.068
Turn around and
face the building!

01:17:13.155 --> 01:17:14.373
Do it now!

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.645
Walk back to the
sound of my voice!

01:17:24.732 --> 01:17:25.776
Keep walking!

01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:28.083
Keep walking!

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:32.174
Take two steps to your right!

01:17:32.261 --> 01:17:34.306
Keep coming, keep coming!

01:17:36.308 --> 01:17:38.571
Stop, go down to your knees!

01:17:40.748 --> 01:17:42.532
Do not move!
Cuff him!

01:17:42.619 --> 01:17:45.535
Link.

Oh, no.

01:20:33.224 --> 01:20:35.487
I need to speak to Mr. Flowers.

01:20:37.663 --> 01:20:38.751
This is your last warning.

01:20:44.148 --> 01:20:46.585

01:20:50.328 --> 01:20:52.026

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:54.637

Well, you called
me in here for some reason.

The dirt box,
they never found it.

01:21:26.538 --> 01:21:28.062
Hmm.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:31.152

Also never found.

01:21:32.109 --> 01:21:34.416
His brother Shawn,

01:21:34.503 --> 01:21:37.898
and Anton and Hector, can't seem
to find them in the system.

01:21:37.985 --> 01:21:39.508

Thanks.
Want a beer?

01:22:48.272 --> 01:22:49.360
Love one.

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.191
Hmm.

01:22:57.325 --> 01:22:59.109
How long are you gonna
keep me in suspense?

01:23:02.504 --> 01:23:04.375
What do you want to know?

01:23:04.462 --> 01:23:05.724
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

01:23:05.811 --> 01:23:08.771
Maybe...
the part where you died.

01:23:10.512 --> 01:23:12.122
Okay.
Hmm.

01:23:12.209 --> 01:23:14.255
Ah.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:16.779
Whoa.

01:23:20.652 --> 01:23:22.306
Mr. Flowers.

01:23:22.393 --> 01:23:24.134
I love the name.

01:23:24.221 --> 01:23:26.528
Okay, you know how this works.

01:23:26.615 --> 01:23:29.052
You have to meet our demands

01:23:29.139 --> 01:23:30.880
or the whole content
of that hard drive

01:23:30.967 --> 01:23:33.187
gets released immediately.

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.450
Doesn't matter if
we're dead or in jail.

01:23:35.537 --> 01:23:37.191
Same thing.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:40.063
- What are your demands?
- Okay, good.

01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:44.067
So the first is I want my
crew released immediately.

01:23:44.154 --> 01:23:47.375
Um, I want identities
for all of us, new ones.

01:23:47.462 --> 01:23:51.205
And $10 million in
each of our accounts.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.337
I'll get you those details.

01:23:53.424 --> 01:23:55.339
A million dollars for Mr. Caras

01:23:55.426 --> 01:23:58.038
and maybe 1 million for
each of the hostages.

01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:02.433
That's it.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.914
What's our guarantee that
the dirt box stays buried?

01:24:05.001 --> 01:24:07.047
Oh, uh, [scoffs] my word.

01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:10.050
You don't have a choice.

01:24:21.931 --> 01:24:24.412
Oh, good man.

01:24:24.499 --> 01:24:26.240
How should we proceed?

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.851
Well, I think first we
should blow up that C4

01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:30.809
and uh, fake our deaths,

01:24:30.896 --> 01:24:32.202
and take it from there.

01:24:39.253 --> 01:24:41.168
Wow.

01:24:41.255 --> 01:24:43.257
And I thought I was ruthless.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:45.520
Well, guy's got to do his job.

01:24:45.607 --> 01:24:48.479
So where does that leave us?

01:24:48.566 --> 01:24:49.915
Right back at the beginning.

01:24:54.181 --> 01:24:56.618
See, I told you she'd come.

01:24:59.447 --> 01:25:01.057
Hi, Shawn.
Great to see you.

01:25:01.144 --> 01:25:02.972
Hey, Amy.

01:25:03.059 --> 01:25:06.062
Yeah, Shawn, uh, Shawn bought
the property next door.

01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:08.499
I'm working on my swimming.

01:25:08.586 --> 01:25:10.371
Yes, I-- I can see that.

01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:13.591
- Want to join me?
- Uh, maybe later.

01:25:19.293 --> 01:25:22.644
Isn't it funny that
greatest score ever

01:25:22.731 --> 01:25:26.865
was as a result of my kid
brother's incompetence?

01:25:26.952 --> 01:25:28.867
I think it's perfect.

01:25:28.954 --> 01:25:30.042
I do, too.

01:25:32.349 --> 01:25:34.917
You know what this place needs?

01:25:35.874 --> 01:25:38.094

01:25:38.181 --> 01:25:41.053
