WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.050
<i>Previously on</i> The Continental...

00:09.135 --> 00:10.803
We don't have much time.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.225
In this neighborhood,

00:16.225 --> 00:17.852
everyone gets
a cigarette machine.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.437
You think you can just
break into my house,

00:19.437 --> 00:20.604
drop off some file,

00:20.604 --> 00:21.731
and everything
just goes back to normal?

00:21.731 --> 00:22.815
I'm trying to help you

00:22.815 --> 00:23.816
with your little
investigation here.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.360
I'm going to kill Cormac,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.112
and I need all of you.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.989
The mess
your people made last night

00:29.989 --> 00:31.741
has brought
the missing coin press

00:31.741 --> 00:34.201
to the attention
of the High Table.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.703
You have three days.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.955
Most folks don't like
to tell every little old thing.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.374
Is there anything else
my brother knows that I don't?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.959
We're trying
to put together a crew.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.336
It might just be
a suicide mission.

00:44.336 --> 00:48.799
Why are you the man
who's going to kill Cormac?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.301
Right there.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.302
The armory?

00:51.302 --> 00:52.762
There's your holy grail.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.305
Perhaps you
could come with me.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.891
I-I could never do that.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.351
Everyone's gonna miss
your music.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.774
No, this is about justice.

01:04.774 --> 01:07.943
I'm offering you a chance
to decide who you want to be,

01:07.943 --> 01:09.320
before it's too late.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.448
I am sick and tired
of people stealing from me.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.117
What was it that Thomas
was trying to steal?

01:16.494 --> 01:17.578
You.

01:27.254 --> 01:31.091
Sleep tight, and no fidgeting.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.843
Why are we sleeping in here?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.637
Is someone coming after us?

01:34.637 --> 01:37.848
They might if they
saw you through the window.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.767
I'll be back in the morning
with breakfast.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.603
Where are you going, Mama?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.854
I'm going to work.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.397
Just go to bed, pumpkin.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.737
Just in case.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.286
It won't always be like this.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.038
Promise?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.123
I promise.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.000
Sweet dreams.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.060
Get the fuck away from me!

02:26.814 --> 02:31.485
I was in the war!

02:33.988 --> 02:36.407
I was in the war!

Oh, my God, Lemmy, would you
please take it seriously?

04:40.656 --> 04:41.991
What?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.575
My character is a Brazilian
soldier of fortune

04:43.575 --> 04:44.827
with early signs of dementia.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.870
Couple stabs in the back
ain't gonna stop him.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.247
Motherfucker's firing blanks.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.624
What? I'm committing.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.376
What, you got a fucking
problem with me?

04:52.376 --> 04:54.503
No, I ain't got
no problem with you.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.047
Imagination's crucial
in our line of work.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.882
All right,
let's just assume, then,

04:58.882 --> 05:01.051
that you two make it
to the armory.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.721
It's only a matter of minutes
before I show up with the key.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.264
- All right?
- Assume?

05:05.264 --> 05:07.641
Oh, we're gonna make it
up to the armory.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.269
It's you getting that key
that really worries us.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.812
And you're absolutely sure

05:11.812 --> 05:13.188
Cormac has this armory key?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.649
Yep, like all
despots, he's too paranoid

05:15.649 --> 05:16.900
to trust anybody else,

05:16.900 --> 05:19.778
so he absolutely has
the key on his person.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.322
What about that kid
on the inside, Charon?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.407
No, no, no, no, no.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.242
Let's just focus on this plan.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.077
We thought
that was the plan.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.162
Hey.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.705
All these killers,
I mean,

05:29.705 --> 05:31.331
don't they bring
their own guns to the party?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.583
Yeah, they all carry
a little something

05:32.583 --> 05:33.709
for personal protection.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.210
But in case
of an all-out assault,

05:35.210 --> 05:37.046
Cormac opens up the armory,

05:37.046 --> 05:40.007
and his guests have full
military-grade firepower

05:40.007 --> 05:42.134
at their disposal.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.844
In this case, for our disposal.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.847
Yeah, but even if we make it
up to the armory before them,

05:46.847 --> 05:49.516
all that firepower is gonna
be useless without an army,

05:49.516 --> 05:51.101
- like Mazie's.
- No, don't worry.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.770
Mazie's on board.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.064
What?
Since when?

05:55.064 --> 05:56.982
Since a few hours from now.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.567
From now?

05:58.567 --> 06:01.403
What the... what the fuck
is going on with you, Winston?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.655
What the fuck
is going on with me, Miles?

06:03.655 --> 06:06.283
I'll tell you.
You all want guarantees.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.661
There are no guarantees!

06:09.661 --> 06:13.665
So, if you want to back out,
now's your chance.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.585
But I am going to kill Cormac
and take his precious

06:16.585 --> 06:19.046
fucking hotel
with or without you.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.300
I'll see you all
at the grand reopening.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.456
So we're still doing this?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.416
Till I'm told otherwise.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.918
By who?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.295
I don't know.
By your brother.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.755
You don't have
your own opinion?

Afternoon.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.984
I'm looking
for Winston Scott.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.694
It's not a name I know.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.321
Sounds like a pedophile.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.074
- He's a person of interest.
- And who are you?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.369
What's in the crate, Lemmy?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.455
That's right.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.166
I know your name.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.417
I know all about this place.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.793
All right.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.254
So then why don't you tell me
what's in the crate?

07:42.254 --> 07:44.673
You really want
to play it like that?

out of this place.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.360
And, honestly,
I don't give a shit.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.655
You're protecting your brother.
I get it.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.075
I had a brother.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.540
I'm just looking
for Winston Scott.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.668
If you know

08:21.668 --> 08:23.754

you'd be dropping by.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.134
Shh.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.177
You hear that?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.428
Hear what?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.561
Do you have roommates?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.022
No.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.565
Well, you do now.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.402
Behind this stove is quite
the variation of feces

09:28.402 --> 09:30.696
- but of the same species...
- Feces?

09:30.696 --> 09:33.156
Which means I have
located the nest.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.533
Nest?

09:34.533 --> 09:35.951
Oh, look.
Look-a here.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.494
Look-a here.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.662
No, no, no, no.
No, no.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.080
He's... he's kicked the bucket.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.498
Oh!

09:41.498 --> 09:43.083
Long ago.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.043
Anyway, don't worry.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.299
Management's agreed to put
you up at a very nice hotel

09:50.299 --> 09:54.261
while I tend to my grisly task.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.807
Oh, but you're... you're no
stranger to nice hotels, I see.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.977
I was, uh... I was there
during the war, Tuscany.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.230
I-I hope you don't
mind me saying,

10:05.230 --> 10:08.400
but a-at first, I thought
you were Lana Turner.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.527
I-I truly did.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.530
Well...

10:15.240 --> 10:16.700
Mm.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.745
Please know how much
I appreciate what you're doing.

10:19.745 --> 10:23.623
No. Pooh.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.002
One thing I know
about rats, they, uh...

10:27.002 --> 10:30.922
they hate the sunlight.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.133
Oh.

10:33.133 --> 10:37.054
Now, there's a view
I'd kill for.

10:39.848 --> 10:43.560
Jenkins is gonna need
something stronger.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.146
Hey.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.732
Where the fuck is Winston?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.650
Very good question.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.652
Are we even doing this?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.866
I don't know.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.118
Let us know
when you find out.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.128
Hey, I need
some armor-piercing rounds.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.756
Can you make a run
to Jersey for me?

11:14.424 --> 11:15.967
What's up?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.178
Maybe I'm just tripping,
but I've been getting

11:18.178 --> 11:21.515
this feeling that something
just ain't right.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.724
I'm going through it.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.309
Like Winston said,
there's no guarantees.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.977
That's not what
I'm talking about.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.605
What are you
talking about, then?

11:28.605 --> 11:31.900
Did Dad know that Jenkins
had a room in that place?

11:33.902 --> 11:35.487
I guess.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.030
Mm-hmm.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.366
And what about this new
Chen motherfucker

11:39.366 --> 11:41.410
forcing us to put
a cigarette machine up in here?

11:41.410 --> 11:44.204
Why you putting me
on the stand?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.997
- For some truth.
- You don't want that.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.541
Trust me, you don't.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.793
You want to know
what I think?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.795
I think you jumped
at the opportunity

11:51.795 --> 11:53.630
to go to that hotel

11:53.630 --> 11:57.134
because you would do anything
just to be different than him,

11:57.134 --> 12:00.303
anything to be the opposite
of what he stood for.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.180
How's that for some truth?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.188
It's all lies.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.608
Let me know
if you can make that run

12:13.608 --> 12:14.818
to Jersey for me, okay?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.778
We're running out of time.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.967
Done with service for today.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.679
Please disembark
the vehicle.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.805
I said get the fuck...

12:43.805 --> 12:46.308
Hey!

12:50.270 --> 12:53.732
Sorry to disturb you,
but do you recall

12:53.732 --> 12:57.277
the man that paid you to have
a private meeting with me?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.571
We need to know
where you dropped him off.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.282
Look, I make
a few dozen stops a day.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.575
I don't know
where I dropped him...

13:05.243 --> 13:09.206
Uh, some hotel near the park.
I'm not sure where.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.875
I suggest you be
more specific.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.793
Okay, okay, okay.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.295
I-I'm telling you
everything I know.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.380
Please.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.090
Like I said,
there's too many people.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.675
No, I don't know.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.513
I dropped him off
at the Rhodes Hotel.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.890
That's all I know.
Please. Please.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.372
You came.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.750
You have five minutes.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.502
Please.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.634
You know, I couldn't
get it out of my head

14:02.634 --> 14:05.971
that you didn't want my money.

14:05.971 --> 14:09.808
And here we are, at a bank.

14:09.808 --> 14:13.770
Yeah, it's a bit ironic,
isn't it?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.773
You see, when I was a kid,
my mother, she worked nights,

14:16.773 --> 14:21.403
made about $16 a week
polishing and scrubbing floors

14:21.403 --> 14:24.364
at a bank a lot like this one.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.408
I remember her
coming home one night

14:26.408 --> 14:29.869
to find an eviction notice
nailed to our front door

14:29.869 --> 14:34.332
and our drunk,
useless old man crying.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.129
Well, Mother, she had pride.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.590
So the next morning,
she marched over to the bank,

14:41.590 --> 14:43.133
me and Frankie in tow,

14:43.133 --> 14:45.677
and she found
the loan department.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.304
All we could do is sit
and watch, though,

14:47.304 --> 14:51.766
as all that pride vanished
as this man in his suit

14:51.766 --> 14:55.103
told her to take her dirty kids
and their homemade clothes

14:55.103 --> 14:56.521
and get the hell out.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.817
And then my mother
did something

15:00.817 --> 15:04.070
that I've never seen
her do before.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.824
She got on her knees,
and she begged for money.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.997
She submitted
to a man in a suit.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.791
And he just snarled at her.

15:16.791 --> 15:20.253
"Don't you know
what this place is?

15:20.253 --> 15:24.382
Who the hell do you think
you are, coming in here?"

15:26.426 --> 15:29.638
And my mother, she looked up
from her knees...

15:31.640 --> 15:34.726
And she said, "I'm the person
who cleans these floors."

15:38.897 --> 15:42.067
You asked for my story, Mazie.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.236
Banks have always made it
their business

15:45.236 --> 15:47.781
to break the poor.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.659
Now, even an empty one
like this,

15:50.659 --> 15:53.203
it sits as a symbol,

15:53.203 --> 15:57.332
casting a shadow
over the less fortunate...

15:57.332 --> 15:59.459
which is why I felt
it was only right

15:59.459 --> 16:02.671
that in your neighborhood,
you should own this one.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.343
Put it to better use.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.850
You bought me this bank?

16:15.850 --> 16:18.269
Oh, but I have
more gifts to bear.

16:21.398 --> 16:25.944
I'm not a big believer
in the suit makes the man.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.906
Well, then think of them
as work clothes.

16:31.282 --> 16:35.745
With your permission,
I'll put your men to work.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.085
Besides, I think
we both can agree it's, uh...

16:42.085 --> 16:44.295
not the suit.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.507
It's what's inside
the suit that counts.

Ah, shit!

Mr. Scott, you have

18:43.456 --> 18:45.291
- Urgent message?
- Mm-hmm.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.838
Thank you.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.761
We found him.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.346
And the coin press?

18:58.346 --> 19:00.640
We'll know shortly.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.893

- Who is it?
- It's Lou.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.672
- You get my message?
- Yeah.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.674
What are you doing here?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.718
Is there something
you're not telling me?

19:36.718 --> 19:38.094
What?
What are you talking about?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.304
I'm talking about cops.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.472
Earlier this pig
comes poking around,

19:41.472 --> 19:43.391
asking about you,
some chick.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.935
And tonight
another one follows me.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.187
How are we even
on their radar?

19:49.856 --> 19:53.067
I have no idea.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.831
Things are getting dicey.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.586
It's getting a little hard
for me to trust here.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.005
Didn't I put enough
in the plate?

20:14.005 --> 20:17.091
Too few mea culpas?

20:17.091 --> 20:21.387
Return this prodigal son to me,

20:21.387 --> 20:25.558
and I promise I will rain
Your justice down upon him.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.227
I scratch Your back,
You scratch mine.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.897
- Can I get an amen, Charon?
- Amen.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.025
You truly are
a man of the cloth.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.321
Oh.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.990
Yeah.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.288
Ah, mother's milk.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.876
The High Table wants to send me
to the glue factory.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.419
This is my house.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.088
It was ordained.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.091
Absolutely. No one will ever
take it from you, sir.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.093
From us, Charon, from us.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.557
And the audacity
of that Adjudicator

21:06.557 --> 21:09.519
to mark me
with an expiration date.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.896
That fucking rat-chewed mutant.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.773
She comes from the rib

21:13.773 --> 21:16.859
and I from the marrow
of the Almighty!

21:16.859 --> 21:18.277
She's an afterthought.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.863
She can take her apple
and fuck off.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.157
That press will find
its way back to me.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.910
You know why? Because those
are my people down there.

21:29.372 --> 21:33.209
It took David
five smooth stones

21:33.209 --> 21:35.670
to topple the giant.

21:35.670 --> 21:39.215
Me, I got a big-ass boulder
up my sleeve.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.885
I hold one sweet secret

21:42.885 --> 21:46.848
that can bring down this entire
empire and swallow it whole.

21:46.848 --> 21:51.436
I can make all their secrets
and all their souls vanish.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.606

21:55.606 --> 21:58.317
- Defensio...
- Shut up.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.488
One trigger is my palm,
and the other

22:02.488 --> 22:05.491
is the palm of Orson,
the bloated freak

22:05.491 --> 22:07.535
that lives in the floor.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.537
Yeah.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.874
I'll take them all
with me if I have to.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.418

28:22.743 --> 28:26.914

almost 20 years ago...

29:20.384 --> 29:21.677

29:22.845 --> 29:25.681

the violin,

29:25.681 --> 29:27.266

29:27.266 --> 29:29.852

29:29.852 --> 29:32.354
Yeah.

29:32.354 --> 29:36.859
You know,
there's one singular note.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.487
It's hardly ever heard.

29:39.487 --> 29:43.782
But it's...
it's the glorious crescendo

29:43.782 --> 29:46.368
of human vocal cords igniting.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.831
I could never quite
get that note.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.880
Your brother confessed
to me one time that...

29:57.880 --> 30:02.384
he was haunted by the screams
of that unfortunate family.

I'd say it's Frankie
who's haunting you.

30:14.813 --> 30:19.777
Charon, our guest
needs a breath of fresh.

30:19.777 --> 30:22.446

30:39.338 --> 30:42.383
Before this goes any further,

30:42.383 --> 30:45.094
I'd like you to get something
through your thick skulls.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.350
Phase one is a go.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.524
Son of a bitch.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.192
Where's my fucking shotgun?

31:04.947 --> 31:08.742
No. No.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.578
Oh, come on.

31:10.578 --> 31:14.248
I took you in,
you fucking ingrate.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.583
I trusted you.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.419
Sir, give me the key
to the armory.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.338
Oh.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.007
Oh, that's your plan.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.050
Well, that's a tall order.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.260
All right.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.970
Keep your shorts on.
I'll give it to you.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.346
Here.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.849
I carry it on my person,
if I can find it here.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.393
Okay, I'm a little nervous.
You want it? Come get it.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.103
Now's your chance, Charon.
Shoot him.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.980
You better shoot me,
'cause if you don't,

31:37.980 --> 31:40.399
I'm gonna send you back
to Zimbabwe a piece at a time.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.109
It's Nigeria.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.527
- Charon, shoot him.
- Yeah, that too.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.070
- Come on, shoot him!
- He can't do it.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.697
My fucking hands
are tied. Shoot him!

31:46.697 --> 31:48.574
- Fuck off.
- No!

31:52.703 --> 31:54.913
You faithless cocksucker.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.624
You'll wish
you were never born.

31:56.624 --> 31:58.208
You'll wish you crawled
back in...

31:58.208 --> 32:00.127
Where the fuck am I?

33:11.198 --> 33:13.242
Twins, where?

33:13.242 --> 33:14.827
What is this?

33:16.370 --> 33:18.080
What are you doing?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.665
Twins.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.125
Never.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.753
We need to stick to the plan.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.881
I'll find them myself.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.944
Is this how you get
to the, uh, gift shop?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.126
Cormac is in the wind.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.128
He's headed to the armory
with the key.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.755
Thank you, Charon.

34:07.755 --> 34:11.592
Go to phase two,
rendezvous at the armory.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.469
What about that shoulder,
Winston?

34:13.469 --> 34:14.762
I've done worse shaving.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.853
- Come with me.
- Okay.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.660
You can't be down here.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.291
Put that down.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.668
Sorry.
Some objects speak to me.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.462
Well, I'm speaking to you.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.339
These are not toys.

34:50.339 --> 34:51.882
Master's coming for you.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.760
Oh, yeah?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.553
Well, let him come.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.679
No.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.474
He's coming for you now.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.083
You son of a...

35:34.633 --> 35:37.636
I should have
taken your legs, too.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.431
You sure you want to do this?

35:41.431 --> 35:43.559
This will get very messy
if you force me to bring out

35:43.559 --> 35:45.060
my brother and his friends.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.228
That's just it.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.063
They're not here.

35:48.063 --> 35:52.150
From what I'm hearing,
they won't be back, ever.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.861
As of now,
this place is shut down.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.612
Bullshit.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.447
My father built this place.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.449
He chose to die here,
and I'm not going nowhere.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.826
Hieronymus Burton

36:00.826 --> 36:02.744
killed the family
that built this place.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.956
Without blinking an eye,
he moved right in.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.417
He was allowed to
by the powers that be,

36:08.417 --> 36:11.086
as long as he continued
to work for them.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.921
That's not true.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.631
Those are facts.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.426
He was a gun for hire.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.845
Killing is in your DNA.

36:22.973 --> 36:26.310
He always claimed
he never used a gun.

36:26.310 --> 36:30.522
Truth is, this one...

36:30.522 --> 36:33.692
this one was special to him.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.361
It's loaded.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.864
Nobody knows the story
better than your brother.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.908
This is why
he kept it from you.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.744
You're sensitive.

36:43.744 --> 36:47.289
Too bad you'll never get
a chance to ask him about it.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.958
Get inside.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.418
Don't let him take me.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.714
Always a beggar.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.846
What is this stuff?

37:44.846 --> 37:47.975
A proprietary drug,
quite popular at this hotel.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.064
Oh, my God.
That's incredible.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.028
I'm sorry
I didn't shoot Cormac.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.531
Yeah, so am I.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.574
Let's hope we get
a second chance.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.705
And away we go.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.510
Red light active.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.930
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

38:26.930 --> 38:29.599
<i>Red light has been activated.</i>

38:29.599 --> 38:31.810
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

38:32.936 --> 38:35.897
<i>Red light has been activated.</i>

38:35.897 --> 38:39.401
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

38:39.401 --> 38:42.654
<i>Red light has been activated.</i>

38:42.654 --> 38:46.241
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

38:47.284 --> 38:49.911
<i>Red light has been activated.</i>

38:49.911 --> 38:53.206
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

38:55.250 --> 38:58.462
<i>Red light has been activated.</i>

38:58.462 --> 39:01.715
<i>Inimicus on Continental ground.</i>

39:10.265 --> 39:12.517
Red light, everyone.
Stick to the plan.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.061
By now, he may have
assembled a team

39:14.061 --> 39:15.771
and made it to the armory.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.606
Well, good.
Then they can let us in.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.869
<i>Up and at 'em.
Shake a leg.</i>

39:30.869 --> 39:31.953
<i>Open up.
Come on.</i>

39:31.953 --> 39:33.914
<i>Come on out.
Hurry up.</i>

39:33.914 --> 39:35.415
<i>Get a move on.
Come on.</i>

39:35.415 --> 39:36.958
<i>What are we waiting for?</i>

39:36.958 --> 39:39.377
<i>It's open season
on Winston Scott.</i>

39:39.377 --> 39:40.879
Proceed to the nearest

39:40.879 --> 39:42.255
<i>pneumatic canister.</i>

39:42.255 --> 39:44.883
<i>Proceed to the nearest
pneumatic canister.</i>

40:13.703 --> 40:15.539
Hey!

40:16.873 --> 40:19.084
Hey, I know you.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.710
You're a cop.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.343
What the...?

40:35.475 --> 40:37.185
No.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.271
I was a cop.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.138
Hi.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.392
Hi.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.935
Please don't hurt me.

41:18.935 --> 41:19.936
I'm Lemmy.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.439
No, I'm a... I'm a...
I'm a good guy.

41:24.274 --> 41:27.110
Nice guy.
Yeah, I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.613
Is that a...
is that a worm tattoo?

41:29.613 --> 41:31.615
I don't want trouble.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.617
No, no.
You don't have to call anybody.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.452
Just... just...
Oh, it's a snake.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.204
And when I get closer,
I see it's an octopus.

41:37.204 --> 41:38.205
That's cool.

41:38.205 --> 41:41.333
Again?

41:41.333 --> 41:44.544
Christ, why does everybody keep
hitting me in the fucking neck?

41:46.171 --> 41:47.339
Why are we fighting?

41:47.339 --> 41:49.216
I don't want to do this.

41:54.888 --> 41:56.348
Jesus.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.902
Jesus, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

42:18.662 --> 42:20.538
Throat-chopping bitch.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.353
We're at the armory.
What's everyone's 20?

42:43.353 --> 42:44.437
Yen is AWOL.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.147
Lemmy's MIA.

42:50.193 --> 42:52.487
I'm pinned down.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.003
Thanks, Gene.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.629
We aim to please.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.548
Come on, cottontail.

43:11.548 --> 43:13.174
Stick your head out, now.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.718
You can do it.

43:14.718 --> 43:16.594
Rookie-ass motherfucker.

43:21.224 --> 43:24.436
Uno más, señor,
<i>you little jive turkey.</i>

43:24.436 --> 43:27.564
<i>Come on, boy.
Where you at?</i>

43:30.650 --> 43:32.986
Come on out, wherever you are.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.620
Yen is AWOL.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.039
<i>Ronnie, what's your status?</i>

43:44.039 --> 43:45.457
I can't tap in.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.125
Got to figure out
how to override that grid.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.085
<i>It's a goddamn zoo
in there, Winston.</i>

43:49.085 --> 43:51.755
All right,
just stick with the plan.

43:51.755 --> 43:53.506
Do you think
he's in there?

43:53.506 --> 43:56.634
There's only one way
to find out.

44:05.477 --> 44:07.062
Hand over the gun.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.438
Up against the wall.

44:08.438 --> 44:09.731
Move.

44:14.069 --> 44:16.404
Nice suits.

44:16.404 --> 44:20.408
Ah, Charon,
this was just too easy.

44:22.410 --> 44:27.165
All of this because
of that bug-eyed cellist?

44:27.165 --> 44:29.376
All he did
was play music.

44:29.376 --> 44:32.921
Well, he sure was a virtuoso.

44:32.921 --> 44:34.381
Too bad you weren't there

44:34.381 --> 44:36.883
for his last
impactful performance.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.593
You know, I told him
to choose the song.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.303
You know what he picked?

44:40.303 --> 44:44.182
"Loyalty to the Master"
from <i>Don Giovanni.</i>

44:44.182 --> 44:46.893
The cellist did know
his audience.

44:46.893 --> 44:49.229
But "Loyalty to the Master,"

44:49.229 --> 44:51.856
that's what he told you
it was about?

44:51.856 --> 44:55.777
That's funny, really funny.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.570
He chose it just for me.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.030
He did.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.324
But what it is about
is damnation.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.910
The central idea is that fate
will catch up to you

45:03.910 --> 45:05.745
and the actions you commit.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.872
You thought
he was playing for you.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.960
But really,
he was just playing you.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.920
Somebody, anybody,
just drop the hammer

45:13.920 --> 45:15.380
on this treasonous puke.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.466
I got a better idea.

45:18.466 --> 45:20.844
Why don't we play
some five-on-five?

45:22.262 --> 45:24.097
Oh.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.403
Surprise.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.612
Cormac's being a gentleman

45:39.612 --> 45:41.614
and has agreed
to open the armory for us.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.327
<i>You see, you're not
the only one with an army.</i>

45:46.327 --> 45:47.829
<i>Now, open the door.</i>

45:47.829 --> 45:50.039
<i>I knew something
smelled rotten here...</i>

45:50.039 --> 45:51.833
<i>Mazie's homeless men</i>

45:51.833 --> 45:53.460
and one woman.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.044
I'm hobo-phobic.

45:55.044 --> 45:58.047
But rounding up a bunch
of homeless derelicts

45:58.047 --> 46:00.925
off the street
isn't gonna help you.

46:00.925 --> 46:04.345
You can dress up a pig,
but you can't make him jig.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.728
Nobody's getting
in this armory!

46:11.728 --> 46:13.897
Kill all these cocksuckers!

46:17.358 --> 46:19.569
Die, motherfucker!

47:04.906 --> 47:06.616
You want to see
how that works?

47:48.283 --> 47:49.867
Winston.

47:56.082 --> 47:59.085
Winston.

48:08.928 --> 48:11.180
Where's Cormac?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.682
Bloody footprints.

48:15.268 --> 48:18.313
Armory entry unsuccessful.

48:18.313 --> 48:22.400
Next phase, kill them.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.193
Kill them all.

48:25.778 --> 48:27.405
Back off, bellboy.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.034
But, sir...

48:31.034 --> 48:33.786
if you want to go to that
floor, you must be announced.

48:33.786 --> 48:35.997
Of course.
What was I thinking?

48:35.997 --> 48:37.248
Be my guest.

48:57.268 --> 49:00.271
You're not supposed
to be here till Wednesday.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.065
I forgot my medication.

49:04.359 --> 49:07.528
I'm gonna need you
to lock that front door.

49:17.497 --> 49:18.915
Edwin.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.588
Shit.

49:30.677 --> 49:32.887
The elevator car is gone.

49:32.887 --> 49:34.889
An elevator car
can't just vanish.

49:34.889 --> 49:38.017
Yeah, I know that.
So where the hell did it go?

49:38.017 --> 49:40.978
Edwin, we need
to find Mr. O'Connor.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.439
Can you help us?

49:45.233 --> 49:46.651
Hmm?

49:49.278 --> 49:51.489
What's he saying?

49:51.489 --> 49:53.282
- Thirteen.
- What?

49:53.282 --> 49:56.285
What the hell does that mean?

49:56.285 --> 49:58.329
Drop the guns.

49:58.329 --> 49:59.914
Okay.

50:03.292 --> 50:06.462
Get out of here, kid.

50:06.462 --> 50:09.340
This is between me and him.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.925
I said go.

50:10.925 --> 50:14.095
Do what she says, Charon.

50:21.561 --> 50:25.022
<i>♪ One

Mr. O'Connor, I...

50:54.594 --> 50:55.970
- Move.
- I didn't get an announcement.

50:55.970 --> 50:57.013
T-this is highly irregular.

50:57.013 --> 50:59.766
Put a sock in it,
dough boy.

50:59.766 --> 51:01.642
All right.

51:01.642 --> 51:04.437

51:16.324 --> 51:18.367

51:22.121 --> 51:23.790
Oh!

51:23.790 --> 51:25.917
<i>You worked too
hard, and you ate too much...</i>

51:25.917 --> 51:27.418
No, no.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.378
Just... just...
just trying to make you

51:29.378 --> 51:30.505
a little more comfortable.

51:30.505 --> 51:33.132
Just lean back.
That's right. That's right.

51:33.132 --> 51:34.801

51:34.801 --> 51:37.178

51:44.602 --> 51:46.145
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

51:46.145 --> 51:47.980
Excuse me.

51:47.980 --> 51:51.025
It's you.

51:51.025 --> 51:54.028
You're the little girl.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.197
Your brother...

51:56.197 --> 51:59.659
lit my family on fire.

51:59.659 --> 52:03.621
But you know that, right?
'Cause you were there.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.414
And both of you
ran like cowards,

52:05.414 --> 52:07.041
leaving us to die.

52:10.044 --> 52:12.255
Now you're gonna feel
what they felt.

52:12.255 --> 52:13.589
No.
No, no, no, no.

52:13.589 --> 52:14.966
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Wait, wait, wait.

52:14.966 --> 52:16.342
Just wait.
Just give me a second, okay?

52:16.342 --> 52:17.635
We were kids, okay?

52:17.635 --> 52:19.679
We had no... we had no idea
there was family...

52:19.679 --> 52:20.930
we had no idea
there was a family in there.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.056
We were just kids,
just like...

52:22.056 --> 52:23.766
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

52:23.766 --> 52:26.477
Please.
Please.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.687
I know you hate me.

52:27.687 --> 52:30.439
But trust me,
I hate myself even more.

52:31.774 --> 52:33.234
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.238
You have no idea
what it's like

52:37.238 --> 52:40.616
to watch your family
burn and die before your eyes.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.578
Actually, I do.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.204
Your brother got his.

52:48.749 --> 52:51.377
Now it's your turn.

52:51.377 --> 52:53.963
Okay, bef...
before you do this,

52:53.963 --> 52:55.965
you need to know
just one thing.

52:57.592 --> 53:00.344
I started the fire...

53:00.344 --> 53:02.763
not Frankie.

53:02.763 --> 53:04.473
And I'm sorry.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.059
I'm so sorry.

53:09.312 --> 53:10.479
You're sorry?

53:10.479 --> 53:11.898
Yes.

53:11.898 --> 53:13.816
You're fucking sorry?

53:22.700 --> 53:25.620
You're sorry?

53:28.164 --> 53:29.332
Shit. No.

53:29.332 --> 53:30.708
No, no, no!

53:30.708 --> 53:32.668
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

53:34.629 --> 53:36.464
Look, here.

53:36.464 --> 53:37.924
Here, here, here, here, here.

53:37.924 --> 53:39.717
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

53:39.717 --> 53:42.219
It's okay. It's okay.
It's medicine.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.638
Trust me.
It's okay.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.309
Here, here, here, here.

53:48.309 --> 53:51.228
Just keep pressure
on it, all right?

53:51.228 --> 53:54.106
I'm gonna come back
for you, all right?

53:54.106 --> 53:55.608
You're gonna be okay.

54:30.977 --> 54:32.979
This way.

54:41.112 --> 54:45.366
<i>Let's all lament
a life ill-spent</i>

54:45.366 --> 54:48.369
<i>as if our hearts might burst.</i>

54:48.369 --> 54:51.872
I'll pour good whiskey
on your grave,

54:51.872 --> 54:55.584
passed through
my kidneys first.

54:55.584 --> 54:58.295
Hello, Continental shoppers.

54:58.295 --> 55:02.216
I'd like to call your attention
to today's red-light specials,

55:02.216 --> 55:04.468
Winston Scott
and his orchestra.

55:04.468 --> 55:05.886
<i>If you haven't met him yet,</i>

55:05.886 --> 55:08.014
<i>I encourage you
to go seek him out.</i>

55:08.014 --> 55:11.308
<i>Anyone who brings me the head
of this honored guest</i>

55:11.308 --> 55:14.979
will receive
a two-million-dollar bounty

55:14.979 --> 55:17.481
and a million
for each member of his band.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.983
Kill Winston Scott?

55:18.983 --> 55:20.443
That's the idea.

55:20.443 --> 55:22.611
Isn't he the only one that
knows where the coin press is?

55:22.611 --> 55:25.031
I'm beyond the coin press.

55:25.031 --> 55:26.907
Where's Cormac
broadcasting from?

55:26.907 --> 55:28.325
The operations room.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.286
Operations room?
Where's that?

55:30.286 --> 55:33.664
Nobody knows...
manager's privilege.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.041
Wait.

55:35.041 --> 55:38.627
Edwin, he said, uh, 13.
You think he meant 13th floor?

55:38.627 --> 55:40.629
But there's no 13th floor.

55:42.465 --> 55:44.550
Hmm, nice.

55:44.550 --> 55:45.843
Yeah.

55:45.843 --> 55:48.012
It was a birthday gift
from Frankie.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.056
From Frankie?

55:50.056 --> 55:51.640
How well
did you know Frankie?

55:51.640 --> 55:53.392
Very well.

55:53.392 --> 55:56.854
Wait, but w-when
I asked you to help...

55:56.854 --> 55:59.648
You assumed, and I let you.

55:59.648 --> 56:02.276
Truth is, I agreed to help
because of your brother.

56:02.276 --> 56:03.944
Frankie talked to me often,

56:03.944 --> 56:06.655
made an effort,
got to know me.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.783
Nobody else did that.

56:08.783 --> 56:11.911
He watched over me
like a big brother.

56:11.911 --> 56:14.288
He encouraged me
to go back home.

56:14.288 --> 56:16.248
He even gave me the means.

56:16.248 --> 56:17.416
The means?

56:34.350 --> 56:36.977
Let's find
that operations room

56:36.977 --> 56:40.689
and make him sing
at his own funeral, huh?

56:40.689 --> 56:43.067
You're gonna see
your father again.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.485
You have my word.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.198
Let's take this house.

56:49.198 --> 56:53.327
<i>And while we're all going
after Cormac's head, remember,</i>

56:53.327 --> 56:56.831
<i>this is more than vengeance.</i>

56:56.831 --> 56:58.749
<i>This is justice.</i>

58:02.062 --> 58:05.774
You mind if I give you
some friendly advice?

58:05.774 --> 58:09.236
I don't mean to criticize,
but, uh, you really do need

58:09.236 --> 58:11.864
to take better care
of these plants.

58:11.864 --> 58:15.451
Too much water is almost
as bad as too little.

58:15.451 --> 58:18.287
I know plants
better than most...

58:18.287 --> 58:19.788
most people.

58:19.788 --> 58:21.332
Excuse me.

58:23.751 --> 58:25.669
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

58:27.129 --> 58:31.217
Last year, I went
to a breathtaking exhibit

58:31.217 --> 58:33.052
at the Brooklyn
Botanical Gardens.

58:33.052 --> 58:38.015
And anyway,
if, in the future,

58:38.015 --> 58:42.603
you'd like to take advantage
of my horticultural expertise,

58:42.603 --> 58:44.230
I'd be, uh...

58:44.230 --> 58:47.816
I'd be happy to come back,
free of charge, of course.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.154
Thank you. Thank you.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.366
I'm so sorry.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.037
How presumptuous.

59:13.467 --> 59:14.802
Down.

59:24.520 --> 59:26.021
Guns.

59:32.861 --> 59:35.864
You take from me,

59:35.864 --> 59:37.950
I take from you.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.749
We all go now.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.341
Yen, no.

59:56.010 --> 59:58.679
I want to kill them both.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:01.098
This whole operation is
about finding a future,

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:03.517
not ending it.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.602
It's time for me
to be with Frankie.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.854
Frankie is dead.

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.856
You're alive.

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:11.984
You have something to live for.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.168
What is that?

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:34.340
An algorithm charting
the statistical probability

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.050
of the enemy's success.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.304
Whose side are you on?

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.514
Numbers are impartial.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.355
Hey!

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.777
Lem, if you can hear this...

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.571
...I got you into this mess.

01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:45.119
Not the first,
but looks like the last.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.995
I ain't proud
of everything we done,

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.664
but I want you to know...

01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:50.541
I got no regrets.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.292
Hope you don't either.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.840
<i>And, uh...
and if you've already gone...</i>

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:02.970
<i>Hope you saved
a fucking seat for me in hell.</i>

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.099
"Seat for me in hell"?

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:09.017
That was embarrassing.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.310
There you go!

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:15.357
But in all seriousness,

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:18.110
I want to thank you
for this, uh...

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.737
new personal low.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.197
What's your 20?

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.283
The speakeasy.

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:25.784
Hostiles up my six-hole.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.411
<i>What's your 20?</i>

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.790
Remember how I got us out
of that thing in On Loc?

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.502
I got some new mail to deliver.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.020
I did not see that coming.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.361
Oh, yes!

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.324
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:07.784
I need you
to hold this for me...

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.077
and watch him.

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:12.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who... who... who...

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.791
Just...

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:18.629
Hi, kid.

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:19.880
Don't let the kid
touch anything.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.215
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.050
Hey, w-here you going?

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.758
No. No!

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.260
No, no, no!

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.761
No!

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.346
Lem! Lem!

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.806
Get out! Get out!

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.978
What the fuck
is he talking about?

01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:17.896
<i>Come in...</i>

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.773
<i>Abort! Abort! Abort!</i>

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.358
<i>He's sending one back
through to the tube!</i>

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.359
<i>Get out of there!</i>

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.569
Where's the mail room?

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:24.695
Lemmy!

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.161
No. Lem!

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.626
Hey!

01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:39.032
Sometimes objects
speak to me.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.419
Yeah.

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.296
We'll talk about that later.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:58.927
Lemmy! Lemmy.

01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:01.513
Oh, shit.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.476
Oh.

01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:08.687
Hey, man.

01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:11.940
Hey, man, you... you look...
you look great.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.775
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.153
What?

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.155
- C-4.
- Yeah?

01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:20.532
It's in my bag.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:23.034
Okay.

01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:25.662
Okay.
It's all right.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.999
- And also...
- What? What? What is it?

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:34.087
I actually love an ascot.

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:41.052
I-I'm just...

01:09:41.052 --> 01:09:43.013
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:07.162
Godspeed, Lemmy.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:14.711
These go everywhere
in the hotel?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.088
They do.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:18.423
All right.

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:20.592
- Ronnie, you tapped in?
<i>- I have eyes.</i>

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:22.385
Good.
Call all locations.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:23.803
Everybody take cover.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.764
Roger that.

01:10:25.764 --> 01:10:27.724
<i>How about we start
with an appetizer</i>

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.935
and serve it to them
in the dining room?

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:37.067
Lobby.

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:37.901
Kitchen.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.530
Do you see a tube

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.741
for the operations room
anywhere?

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.578
Here.
But it's been destroyed.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.539
Of course it has.

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.041
Wait.
You're right.

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:55.168
The OR tube must go
to the 13th floor.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.962
Okay.
So how do we get there?

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:59.381
I worked in the kitchen
when I first started.

01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:00.966
There's a dumbwaiter.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:03.760
Even
hidden floors need service.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.053
Yes.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.016
The dumbwaiter is there.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:14.187
Now we're even.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.438
It's right here.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.277
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:25.490
This is gonna hurt.

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.950
Ah.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.952
Oh.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.829
- Mm.
- You all right?

01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:33.540
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.712
Oh.
This was a really dumb idea.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:39.713
Come on.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:48.596
The insurgents
have now achieved

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:49.973
competitive advantage.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.393
Oh.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.645
I asked for assistance.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.731
I asked them for resources.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.607
But they...
oh, those motherfuckers...

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:02.235
they put it back on me.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.486
The High Table?

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.784
I warned them.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:12.620
Orson...

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.123
I could use a hand here.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.251
Defensionem protocol
does not apply

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.045
- under present conditions.
- Oh.

01:12:20.045 --> 01:12:21.379
What was I thinking?

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:55.570
A monumental conclusion.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.826
I'll give you one better.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.331
Turgid lackey.

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.150
Orson?

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:38.154
He's, uh, got his mind
on other things right now.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.947
I see.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.575
And I presume you wish
the High Table to intervene.

01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:46.746
Yesterday.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:51.084
Do you have the coin press?

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:53.961
If I had it, I wouldn't need
your help, now, would I?

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.256
I always liked Orson.

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:06.474
You would.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.823
You want to play games, huh?

01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:25.284
Let's play some hardball.
Come here, pretty boy.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:31.874
There you go.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:39.882
We're all going to hell anyway.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:35.224
A self-destruction switch.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:37.935
It will take the entire
building to the ground,

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:40.146
all of its secrets,
all of its souls.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:43.983
How do we stop it?

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:46.235

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:54.160
Yes.
Northeast corner.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.786
He's running.

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.830
I can take us.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.833
No, no, no, no.
We don't have time.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.585

Now I'm gonna get a kick
out of watching you and yours

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:49.757

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:13.322
tell him I sent you boys
to torch that building

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.491
'cause I wanted you
to do something

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.660

doesn't make a man.</i>

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.546
<i>No, it's what's inside
the suit that counts.</i>

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.632
<i>But a wolf in sheep's clothing
can't rely</i>

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:35.842
<i>on killer instinct alone.</i>

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:40.305
<i>It's his resourcefulness
and perhaps an open heart</i>

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:44.226
<i>that can turn garbage
into gold...</i>

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.728
<i>and enemies into allies.</i>

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:55.445
Well, that's lovely.

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:58.991
But regrettably, the hotel
wasn't yours to take.

01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:00.534
Let me be transparent.

01:33:00.534 --> 01:33:05.831
Despite what you may think,
you did not stop Defensionem.

01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.165
I did.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.542
If your brother
would have just done

01:33:08.542 --> 01:33:10.711
what he was instructed to do
with the coin press,

01:33:10.711 --> 01:33:13.088
you would not be in this
very unfortunate situation.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:18.051
You know,
where from I'm standing,

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:22.472
seems to me you're the one
in the unfortunate situation...

01:33:22.472 --> 01:33:26.143
'cause if Cormac taught me
one thing, it's leverage.

01:33:26.143 --> 01:33:29.730
I not only beat him at his
own game, but I took his house.

01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:31.690
And now I'm in control
of the one thing

01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:34.901
that you people
seem to need.

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:37.446
Oh, but don't worry.
I can assure you...

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:40.073
the coin press
is in a very safe place.

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:48.040
<i>You know, in business,
I've never been one</i>

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.125
for dealing with middlemen.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:53.045
And I've never killed
a messenger before.

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:56.590
There are rules
at play here, silly boy.

01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.550
You have no idea
who you're dealing with,

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.469
but you soon will.

01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:03.013
No, I know the rules.

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:06.266
And what do you imagine I'm
going to tell the High Table?

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:08.685
You don't even
register to them.

01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:11.146
They won't speak to you.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:12.856
Hmm.

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:17.819
They will now.

01:34:34.795 --> 01:34:36.254
