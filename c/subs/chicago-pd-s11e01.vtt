[police radio chatter]

01:04.606 --> 01:07.025
- OK, let the record show
I'm tracking you down.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.109
I'm trying here.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
Hank, it's been six months.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.114
- Why am I having to fight for
a parking spot in my own lot?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.157
- Are you kidding me?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.283
It's pilot day.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.910
I told you this.

01:16.951 --> 01:20.538
Brass is having a shadow,
13 new pilot programs today.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.293
It's called "New Possibilities
in Policing."

01:25.335 --> 01:26.544
We talked about this.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.089
I'm taking your team
for the day.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.466
- I didn't forget.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.221
I'm on my way there now.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.016
- It's been six months, Hank.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.310
- I know.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.690
- Your team can't go with
a vacancy for this long.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.983
You've already got Torres
out on his furlough

01:49.025 --> 01:50.527
helping with his ma.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.780
I get that you don't want
to fill Adam's spot.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.870
- Um, what program
am I shadowing?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.205
- You see what my day is.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.916
You see why all my
sympathy is gone.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.376
- Excuse me.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.670
- The chief needs to know
that your team is moving on.

02:08.712 --> 02:09.963
- I know.

02:10.005 --> 02:17.178
* *

02:21.683 --> 02:25.603
- You're gonna have
to give me a name.

[door beeps]

02:34.237 --> 02:38.950
- [panting]
What was it?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.745
What was the time?
- 14:51.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.121
- Damn it.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.832
- It's all right.
How your lungs feel?

02:45.874 --> 02:48.001
- I'm fine.
I just--rehab cleared me.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.544
It's my ego that's hurting.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.672
I fail the power test again
tomorrow, I'm not--

02:52.714 --> 02:54.507
- Voight will find a way
to hold your spot.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.593
You got shot, doc.
We'll figure it out.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.595
- Hey.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.221
When you're at the test, your
adrenaline will be pumping,

03:00.263 --> 03:01.806
and you will pass
this time, OK?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.308
Kev, we got to go.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.476
If we're late today,
Platt will kill us.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.354
- Mm-hmm. All right.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.898
- Be safe.
- Yep.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.900
Program's called "CPU."

03:11.941 --> 03:14.569
Basically, think of it
as a new approach

03:14.611 --> 03:16.363
to handling
mental health-related calls.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.073
- Crisis intervention team.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.240
- Exactly.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.034
The way we operate is simple.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.119
Van here allows us to
respond to calls as a team.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.413
Team always includes
a mental health clinician.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.873
Today, that's me.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.250
Uh, paramedic,
that's Tinny over there,

03:29.292 --> 03:31.544
and a crisis-trained
police officer.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.672
- Hey, nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.965
- Now, instead of solo police
with little mental health

03:36.007 --> 03:39.260
awareness arriving to a
mental health incident alone,

03:39.302 --> 03:40.637
an entire team arrives.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.722
Our team's trained
70 hours in psych

03:42.764 --> 03:44.516
and specialized
de-escalation tactics,

03:44.557 --> 03:46.810
which allows for a lessened
likelihood of violence

03:46.851 --> 03:50.230
and less police killings
of the mentally ill.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.606
- Sounds simple.

03:53.441 --> 03:57.028
How do you determine
lead on scene?

03:57.070 --> 04:00.281
- By whoever connects best.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.075
[chuckles]

04:02.117 --> 04:05.078
- Attempted burglary in
progress, 5535 South Leavitt.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.831
Caller states a male white,
20s, gray hoodie, jeans,

04:07.872 --> 04:09.958
incoherent,
nonresponsive, angry.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.960
He's attempting to break
into an apartment building.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.128
- Hey, that sounds good.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.754
- I'm in.
- Let's take it.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.549
Oh, we decide our calls by
an all-hands-on-deck vote.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.175
You're with us today,
so I guess you get a vote.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.011
What do you say?

04:21.052 --> 04:22.929
- Sure.
Let's do it.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.108
- Hey, Mo, what do you got?

04:35.150 --> 04:36.735
- OK, so we just got here
a minute ago, right?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.319
Now, this man
doesn't look armed.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.487
He hasn't really been
responding to us.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.780
Don't really know
if he's able to.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.365
Also, don't know if
he lives here either.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.450
- OK.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.411
We got it.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.787
[banging on door]

04:47.829 --> 04:48.830
Hey.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.206
Morning, sir.
How you doing?

04:50.248 --> 04:51.332
- Got to get inside.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.625
Got to get inside to check.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.002
- You got to get inside?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.086
OK.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.965
I can help you with that.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.967
[banging]

05:01.009 --> 05:02.469
Well, my name's Mitchell.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.845
I'm a doctor.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.680
A couple of neighbors
across the street called.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.140
They wanted to make sure
you got help getting

05:07.182 --> 05:08.892
wherever it is you need to go.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.477
Can you tell me
if you live here?

05:10.518 --> 05:11.895
- They don't understand.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.605
They don't understand,
but I got to get inside.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.983
- What--I don't understand yet,
but I'd like to.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.277
[banging]

05:19.319 --> 05:20.945
Don't worry, sir.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.906
Everyone here is gonna
stay back while you and I talk.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.783
- They don't understand,
but I--

05:24.824 --> 05:26.117
- What do I need to understand?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.827
- [stammering]
I might need to get inside

05:27.869 --> 05:29.662
so that I can check
to make sure that he's OK

05:29.704 --> 05:31.331
because it might not be done!

05:31.373 --> 05:33.792
It might not be done!

05:35.919 --> 05:37.253
- Hey.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.297
- Hailey, we're good.
Go on and step back for me.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.882
- Don't let them, I can't let--
- Hey, look at me.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.467
- Hailey, let's remember,
you're a shadow here today.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.260
You're observing.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.428
- Hey.
- Don't let--

05:45.470 --> 05:47.013
Don't let them in.
- Detective Upton.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.515
- Don't let them inside.
Don't let them inside.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.766
- Detective Upton.
- Can't let them inside.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.184
- Hey. It's OK.
Turn around and look at me.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.519
- Let me in!
- Detective!

- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

05:55.522 --> 05:57.524
Keep your hands up
and look at me. It's OK.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.858
Turn around.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.026
No!

06:00.068 --> 06:01.194
- It's OK. Put your hands
behind your back.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.654
- What are you doing?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.364
- It's OK. It's OK.
- No, please.

No!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.705
- Stay back!
Officer, get in here.

- No, no, no, no!

06:15.750 --> 06:17.919
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.212
It's gonna be OK.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.588
Stop resisting.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.465
You're gonna be OK.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.219
[tense music]

06:26.261 --> 06:28.221

- It's OK.

- 5021 Henry, emergency.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.994
I need additional units
and CFD.

06:51.036 --> 06:55.498
I got a strong gas smell
at 5535 South Leavitt.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.293
- Copy, 5021 Henry.

- 5021, I've got two bodies,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.444
heavy blunt trauma,
one still breathing.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.904
I've got an active fire.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.615
I need CFD to evacuate
the building.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.743
- Copy, 5021 Henry.
CFD en route.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.914
- [grunting]
I got you.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.004

07:49.511 --> 07:51.638
OK. OK.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.785
- She was conscious for
at least a minute inside.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.830
- One, two, three.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.082
- I had to move her.
I had no choice.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.583
- It's OK.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.835
We got her.
You're all right.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.503
- All right.
I got the door.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.092
[engine turns over]

[indistinct chatter]

08:33.263 --> 08:36.349
[siren wailing]

08:39.269 --> 08:40.687
- What the hell happened?

08:40.729 --> 08:42.147
You OK?
- Yeah.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.607
Got one DOA, one critical.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.443
Scene looked like one offender.
It looked personal.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.028
Both victims were beaten
with a baseball bat.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.946
Offender beat them so hard,
they broke the bat.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.614
- Jesus.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.991
- Fire was set
to destroy evidence.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.451
- Yeah, that's my guess too.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.077
Got one in custody
at the scene.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.787
Looked like he was having
some sort of mental break.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.122
He was trying to
get back inside.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.582
- I should be able to
take you inside soon

09:00.623 --> 09:02.625
as long as you wear
safety equipment.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.210
- We'll follow you.
You good?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.670
- You all right?
- Yeah, go. I'm good. I'm good.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.630
Yeah, go.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.631
Hey!

09:09.424 --> 09:11.676
Hey!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.553
I told you to check him out
at the curb.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.180
- He's got to be gone by now.
He's got to be gone.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.640
- Dr. Mitchell said to route
him to a nearby hospital.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.476
- No, this man is being
arrested for murder.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.311
Intelligence is taking it.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.771
Is he medically cleared?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.606
- There's no physical injuries.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.399
- Yes or no.
Is he medically cleared?

09:26.441 --> 09:27.442
- Yes, he's clear.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.818
- OK, grab him.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.153
- Come on.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.155
- You. You.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.907
You didn't let me in.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.658
Is he gone?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.869
He's got to be gone now, right?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.037
Gone--he's--

09:39.079 --> 09:40.038
he's gone.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.331
- Shoes.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.041
- He's got to be gone
right now.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.334
He's got to be.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.502
He's got to be gone.
- Stand up.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.920
- So I did good.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.921
- Get up.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.172
- OK.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.507
- Move to the wall.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.758
- It's OK, I'm here.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.426
- Face forward,
toes on the line.

- It's OK...

Put these on.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.696
[camera shutter clicking]

10:12.737 --> 10:14.531
- After this, get close-ups
of the injuries.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.450
- Turn to the right.
Arms up.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.035
Turn to the left.

Matches with the
victims fighting back.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.968
He's got blood inside
and outside his shoes.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.512
I'm gonna ask forensics
to rush the testing on that.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.888
- His clothes?

10:38.930 --> 10:40.598
- He's clean,
but he showered recently.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.891
His hair is wet.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.852
He's got soap residue
all over his skin.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.894
He beat them,
and then he went home

10:44.936 --> 10:46.104
to shower, change his clothes.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.189
He just didn't clean
his shoes very well.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.899
Afterward, he had some
sort of mental break,

10:49.941 --> 10:51.234
returned to the scene
to make sure

10:51.276 --> 10:52.569
all the evidence was gone.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.237
- I ran the ID you sent me.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.948
Suspect's name is Cam Boyd,
23, has a juvie record

10:56.990 --> 10:59.409
and a couple of stays
at level 4 treatments

10:59.451 --> 11:01.411
for behavioral
and mental issues.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.246
He's got an older brother
named Derrick.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.041
It's his only family.
And Cam lives alone.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.542
- He's local.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.085
- Yeah, lives five blocks
from where you found him.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.503
Could have walked there.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.630
I just--I don't have any
cameras to confirm any of it,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.424
and I don't have PODs
to confirm timeline.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.759
- All right.
And our victims?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.927
- The victims are
Aaron and Jess Turner.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.596
Aaron actually lived
at that apartment,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.348
had a few priors
for possession.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.891
His sister is Jess.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.477
She's clean as a whistle,
worked at a school in Indiana.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.686
Just here visiting
for the weekend.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.772
Wrong place, real wrong time.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.565
- We've got evidence that
Cam knew both of them.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.192
He went to grade school
with Aaron.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.527
I'm still digging into
Cam's social media,

11:34.569 --> 11:38.156
but I already found beef
between them.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.658
OK, so Aaron calls Cam
"bitch boy."

11:40.700 --> 11:43.411
Cam responds, "Keep on talking,
bitch, you'll pay.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.621
I'll make sure
you're gonna pay."

11:44.662 --> 11:45.622
- We have enough to press him.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.999
- Yeah.
Go take him.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.463
- Hey.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.715
You got to talk to me.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.053
Hey!

12:00.095 --> 12:01.721
- It's OK.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.015
[tense music]

12:04.057 --> 12:05.308
It's OK.
You don't have to tell her.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.643
It's OK.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.937
- It's not OK,
and you do have to tell me.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.522
What happened to
Aaron and Jess?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.191
- She doesn't understand,
but he's gone.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.611
- Yeah, Aaron's dead,
and Jess is barely hanging on.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.698
You have to tell me
what happened, Cam.

12:19.739 --> 12:26.204
* *

12:27.414 --> 12:29.874
- Aaron's not...

12:29.916 --> 12:31.543
good.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.756
He's not nice, you understand?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.717
I'm not sorry he's dead.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.968
I hate Aaron.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.053
I--I'm--I'm glad he's gone.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.681
- You're glad that
he's dead, hmm?

12:44.723 --> 12:46.975
Are you glad that
you killed him,

12:47.017 --> 12:48.685
that you beat both of them
with a bat

12:48.727 --> 12:50.228
until they couldn't move?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.396
- No.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.689
- Are you proud?
- No.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.898
- OK, so tell me why
you're glad.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.567
- No, you don't understand.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.901
- Then make me understand.
What happened?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.528
- He's gone.
- I know he's gone.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
Why did you go to
that apartment, huh?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.698
- He's gone.
She doesn't understand.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.616
She's not listening.
- I am listening. I am.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.744
What, Jess was there too, huh?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.328
And then what?
They--they got angry?

13:07.370 --> 13:08.997
- I did good.
- And they fought back?

13:09.039 --> 13:10.331
And then, what,
you chased them?

13:10.373 --> 13:11.624
- I did good.
He's gone.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.834
He's safe.
- Dead is not safe.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.044
- No, I handled it.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.295
- You handled it
by beating them?

13:15.337 --> 13:17.839
I could see her brain.
- Stop. Stop.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.424
- I'm not gonna stop until
you tell me what happened.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.675
- No, no. No, no.
- What happened?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.969
[tapping on window]

13:23.011 --> 13:24.012
- Hey.
- I'm glad.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.263
- Just tell me what happened.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.057
- He's gone. He's gone.
I'm glad he's gone.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.767
- OK, so I know you're glad.
- I'm glad he's gone!

13:28.808 --> 13:30.435
- I just need
a few more minutes.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.895
- You can't have them.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.607
- Sarge--
- I'm not repeating myself.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.697
- I have him.
He's gonna break.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.407
Whoa.
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.909
I offered, he declined.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.119
- Dr. Mitchell
called Cam a lawyer.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.120
- What?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.622
- Cam's exhibiting
every symptom

13:50.663 --> 13:52.248
of an undiagnosed
mental illness.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.250
He's being placed on a medical
hold for his own protection.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.211
- That man in there
is gloating,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.171
and he's about to confess--
you're not doing that.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.756
- I am.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.132
Look, you're allowed
to take over this case,

14:01.174 --> 14:03.426
but I don't answer to you--
neither does his lawyer.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.054
You're done.

14:12.102 --> 14:12.310
.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.728
- It's completely within my
purview to call Cam a lawyer

14:15.105 --> 14:16.690
and to recommend a psychiatric
hold for his protection.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.024
- Protection from what?
From me?

14:18.066 --> 14:19.275
What do you think I'm gonna do?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.361
I'm following
police procedure protocol.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.239
- And that protocol is a threat
to him in his mental state.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.199
- My client's protection
is crucial--

14:26.241 --> 14:28.368
- What about the protection
of Aaron and Jess,

14:28.410 --> 14:32.539
the ones whose skulls were
bashed in with a baseball bat?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.249
Protecting them?
- No.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.584
It's my job to protect the man
having a mental crisis,

14:36.626 --> 14:42.424
to protect him when police
passions overtake his safety.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.801
Would you like me to list
the mentally-ill suspects

14:44.843 --> 14:46.302
who have died
in police custody?

14:46.344 --> 14:50.223
- OK, you made your point
real loud and clear.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.064
- This is absurd.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.817
- Is there anything we can do?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.402
- Short answer, no.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.362
Look, you don't actually
have any evidence.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.905
It's all circumstantial.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.408
Judge is not gonna sign
a search warrant on this.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.119
- There's no loopholes
in his little program?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.328
- No.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.415
Program's new,
but psychiatric hold isn't.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.792
He had a right to call
the lawyer to place the hold,

15:17.834 --> 15:19.127
and you know the rest.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.712
It could take up to 72 hours.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.047
Police can't talk to him.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.673
He's gonna walk
when the hold's up.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.300
- Hmm.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.969
- I'm sorry.
It is what it is.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.311
- Wait, not you.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.312
Close the door.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.980
- I don't need to
close the door.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.482
And I don't need you to
tell me to calm down.

15:40.523 --> 15:45.111
I had their blood on my hands,
and Cam is good for it.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.406
- Jay signed
the divorce papers?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.824
- What?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.744
- Hailey, you left them on
your desk out in the open.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.913
So now, I got to ask,
are you OK?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
Look, you need time off?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.167
- No, I don't need time off.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.002
- OK.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.421
- Jay's been gone for a year.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.715
The papers are signed.
I just need to mail them.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.217
- Hmm.

16:07.258 --> 16:11.346
- One thing doesn't
equate to the other, OK?

16:11.388 --> 16:13.264
I can be upset when
a case is screwed.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.141
- Yeah.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.060
OK.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.065
Go find some evidence then.

16:22.107 --> 16:25.026
[soft dramatic music]

16:25.068 --> 16:32.200
* *

16:42.877 --> 16:44.170
- Tell me you have something.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.588
- They put Cam in a hold?

16:45.630 --> 16:47.132
- Yep, for up to 72 hours.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.883
- Well, the DNA and
blood comparisons

16:48.925 --> 16:51.136
came back from Cam's
shoes and socks.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.804
Turns out,
it was Cam's own blood.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.097
- Wait, what?

16:54.139 --> 16:55.223
Not the victims?
- No.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.892
I mean, there was
victim DNA on there.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.061
It wasn't blood.
But Aaron's DNA was on them.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.146
- Samples must have
been corrupted then.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.772
- Maybe.
I'm having them retest,

17:02.814 --> 17:04.315
but the judge says
it's not enough.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.067
- What about the
social media threats?

17:06.109 --> 17:08.319
- Too vague.
Too circumstantial.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.488
Fire and water destroyed
any DNA in that apartment.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.282
Now, I'm having
the phone provider

17:12.323 --> 17:14.701
send Cam's phone logs because
his cell wasn't on him.

17:14.743 --> 17:16.119
- Here we go.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.996
We got something new on
Aaron's social media.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.165
He posted a video
24 hours ago

17:20.206 --> 17:21.708
and then deleted it
20 minutes after that.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.669
Dumbass must have realized
it was a dumb post.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.212
[keyboard clacking]

17:26.254 --> 17:29.883
OCD was able to recover it,
and this ain't nothing nice.

17:29.924 --> 17:33.803
- [grunting, shouting]

17:33.845 --> 17:34.804
- Is that Cam?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.348
- Yeah, that's Cam.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.766
This was shot on Aaron's phone.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.434
I'm pretty sure he was
the one holding the camera.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.227
- What, little bitch boy,
you want to say something?

17:41.269 --> 17:42.979
- Aaron, no, I--
[grunts]

17:43.021 --> 17:44.356
- Go ahead.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.858
Your crazy ass
can't even talk, can you?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.526
What you want to say?
Say it.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.695
- That ain't vague.
That's motive.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.238
That's retribution.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.490
Aaron beat the hell
out of Cam.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.241
Cam returned
to repay the favor.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.452
There's enough there
for a warrant.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.204
- [sighs]

17:59.245 --> 18:00.872
- Chicago PD!
Search warrant!

18:00.914 --> 18:03.875
[dramatic music]

18:03.917 --> 18:06.753
* *

18:06.795 --> 18:08.046
I got blood.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.173
- I'll check the basement.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.470
- Clear here.

18:15.512 --> 18:22.185
* *

18:22.227 --> 18:24.854
- I've got more blood here.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.982
Looks like he was pacing.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.567
I'm gonna go check
the backyard.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.944
- Copy that.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.384
- [gasps]

18:54.426 --> 18:57.345
[grunting]

19:06.980 --> 19:10.358
[choking]

19:15.655 --> 19:16.990
- Hailey!

19:17.032 --> 19:19.909
- [coughs]
He's got a gun!

19:19.951 --> 19:21.411
- Hey!

19:21.453 --> 19:23.204
Chicago PD!
Stop!

19:23.246 --> 19:25.290
[gunshots]
Ah!

19:25.331 --> 19:28.001
5021 David,
shots fired at the police.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.295
Offender fleeing eastbound
from the alley off Bronson.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.213
White male, 30's.
- Help!

19:32.255 --> 19:33.381
Somebody help!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.841
- White t-shirt, light jeans.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.594
I need cars, please!

19:37.635 --> 19:39.137
[woman crying]

19:39.179 --> 19:40.305
- Help!
Oh, please.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.182
- Chicago PD!
- Help!

19:42.223 --> 19:43.475
Help me.
Help.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.934
[screams]
- I'm here to help.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.519
Are you OK?
- Help him!

19:46.561 --> 19:47.645
[crying]

19:47.687 --> 19:49.105
Help him, please.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.440
- I need you to grab a towel.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.691
I need to apply
pressure right now.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.068
- I don't know what happened.
[crying]

19:53.109 --> 19:54.152
- Up here.
- I can't even--

19:54.194 --> 19:55.445
- Hold that right there, ma'am.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.488
Hold that right there ma'am!

19:56.529 --> 19:58.031
Hold that right there, ma'am.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.324
5021 David, rolling in--
- [coughing]

19:59.366 --> 20:00.784
- The back alley off Bronson.

20:00.825 --> 20:04.079
I got a GSW to the neck
of a victim down.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.164
- On my way, Kev.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.376
- [coughing]

20:16.591 --> 20:18.635
Jesus.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.978
[suspenseful music]

20:29.020 --> 20:35.694
* *

20:38.905 --> 20:40.115
- Hailey?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.783
- That was Cam's brother.

20:41.825 --> 20:42.951
- What? What?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.537
- Cam's brother, he was here.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.374
He--he had blood splatter
all over him.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.793
The clothes inside.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.129
This is his car.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.801
He's our offender.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.262
I think I got it wrong.

21:07.642 --> 21:07.851
.

21:07.892 --> 21:08.268
- [sobbing]

21:09.686 --> 21:12.605
- [whispering]

21:16.067 --> 21:18.069
- What do we got?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.030
- Uh--
[clears throat]

21:20.071 --> 21:22.407
Offender is Derrick Boyd,
Cam's brother.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.700
Derrick was in the garage.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.077
He, um, was looking
for Cam, I think.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.496
He fled after he jumped me.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.707
Fired three shots at Atwater,

21:30.749 --> 21:33.793
and one of the bullets
hit the homeowner next door.

21:33.835 --> 21:36.254
Homeowner is on his way
to Med right now, but, um...

21:36.296 --> 21:37.881
- OK, and Derrick?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.257
- He's in the wind.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.718
Got BOLOs out,
mile radius closed down--

21:41.760 --> 21:46.556
um, patrol searching,
but got nothing so far.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.016
- Kim?

21:48.058 --> 21:50.393
- All the blood's consolidated
to the driver's seat.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.145
I don't think Derrick
had a passenger with him.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.480
- Huh.

21:53.521 --> 21:54.856
- Derrick had blood
all over him.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.900
T-shirt and sweatshirt
inside had blood on them

21:56.941 --> 21:58.151
and wood splinters.

21:58.193 --> 22:01.529
Think it was wood
from the--the bat.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.573
- Recovered Cam's phone
from his house.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.783
It was open.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.701
An hour before
the Garfield Park incident,

22:06.743 --> 22:08.703
he called his brother three
times and then texted him,

22:08.745 --> 22:11.206
"Don't do this.
Please don't do this."

22:11.247 --> 22:12.540
- OK, any evidence
Cam might have been

22:12.582 --> 22:14.334
at the scene with him?
- No.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.710
I mean, there's no blood
on his clothes,

22:15.752 --> 22:17.337
no blood in his bedroom--
we can luminol the shower,

22:17.379 --> 22:19.255
but there's no visible signs
of blood.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.091
- That's because Cam was
never in that apartment.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.133
I got it wrong.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.551
- We all got it wrong, Hailey.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.388
- Cam's bruises,
the blood inside of his shoes,

22:26.429 --> 22:28.348
that was all from his earlier
beatdown with Aaron.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.766
Cam kept telling me
that he was safe.

22:29.808 --> 22:30.809
He was gone.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.102
He was glad he was gone.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.269
He was talking
about his brother.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.939
He was glad that he was safe.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.691
Derrick must have found out
about the beatdown

22:37.732 --> 22:39.359
with Aaron, snapped.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.277
Cam then figured out
what his brother was gonna do.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.779
He was trying to stop him.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.406
He probably showed up
at that apartment

22:44.447 --> 22:46.616
minutes after his brother left.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.827
It was all right there,
and I missed it.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.788
And I don't know how,
but I missed it.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.498
- Well, it doesn't matter
right now.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.417
All that matters
is that we find Derrick.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.876
OK, we got an LKA?

22:56.918 --> 22:58.878
- Tact's en route.
They're gonna sit on it now.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.338
- OK, hit it with them.

23:00.380 --> 23:03.049
Hailey, you go back to 21,
man the digital search.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.552
Let's find Derrick now.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.890
- No, not a single hit on
Derrick's credit cards.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.142
That man's not using those.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.685
- Nothing on
previous addresses.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.311
He's got no other vehicles
registered in his name.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.980
- Uh, what about CTA?

23:17.022 --> 23:18.023
What about the bus?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.482
- Nothing yet.

23:19.524 --> 23:20.984
Transit teams are up.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.068
- Guy is laying low.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.653
- Derrick's house is clear.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.364
I have UCs sitting on it
in case he comes home, but--

23:26.406 --> 23:27.991
we've checked
all known associates.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.117
- Yes, we have.

23:29.159 --> 23:30.493
He does not have
many associates.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.162
He's got a strong history
of violence,

23:32.203 --> 23:33.872
and he did time
for assault twice.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.081
Doesn't have many friends.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.499
He never kept up
with his cellies.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.085
The only family
that he has is Cam.

23:39.127 --> 23:42.672
- Derrick's finances are like
a love letter to his brother.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.674
He paid for his credit cards,
his loans.

23:44.716 --> 23:48.845
He's paid for programming,
meds, schooling.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.305
He spent his whole life
taking care of his brother.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.806
[phone buzzing]

23:51.848 --> 23:53.058
Probably not the first
beating Cam endured.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.185
Probably couldn't take it.

23:55.226 --> 23:59.564
- Homeowner just bled out.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.859
- Hey, talk to my contact
at Birchfield.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.861
Cam's psych hold is up.
They're letting him go.

24:04.903 --> 24:05.987
- What? Already?

24:06.029 --> 24:08.740
- Yeah, so if you
want to talk to him...

24:17.540 --> 24:19.459
- Cam's cleared?
It's only been 12 hours.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.461
- Well, the hospital
is in overflow.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.921
Pushed him out fast.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.631
Deemed him no longer a danger
to himself or others.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.549
- So he's mentally fit.

24:26.591 --> 24:30.303
- I can't give you any of
his medical information.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.889
But I also can't stop you
from talking to him now.

24:32.931 --> 24:37.894
He fired his lawyer, refused
any additional care, so...

24:37.936 --> 24:41.523
Is he still a suspect?

24:41.564 --> 24:44.984
- No, he's not.

24:45.026 --> 24:48.154
I'm not a bad cop.

24:48.196 --> 24:50.865
- I never once said you were.

24:50.907 --> 24:54.744
Would be real simple
if the problem was bad cops.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.372
It ain't.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.421
[soft dramatic music]

25:04.462 --> 25:11.344
* *

25:11.386 --> 25:14.305
- Cam?

25:14.347 --> 25:16.766
- No, I'm not talking to you.

25:16.808 --> 25:19.936
- I just have a few questions.
- No, I'm--

25:19.978 --> 25:22.230
I told them that
I'm done with treatments.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.149
I'm done with hospitals.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.192
I fired that lawyer.
I'm done.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.444
All right?
I'm going home.

25:27.485 --> 25:29.571
- I get that.

25:29.612 --> 25:30.613
You get to go home.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.615
- Yeah, I know
I get to go home.

25:32.657 --> 25:38.121
- But Cam, your brother
won't be there.

25:38.163 --> 25:40.874
I know it was Derrick
who beat Aaron and Jess.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.417
He found out what
Aaron did to you.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.793
- No, no, no.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.337
I'm not--I'm not
listening to this.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.339
- And he went there
to pay Aaron back,

25:47.380 --> 25:49.883
but he lost control
of his anger.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.885
He killed Aaron.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.512
He beat Jess,
an innocent person.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.764
- I'm going home.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.766
- And then he shot
at the police.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.225
He killed an
innocent bystander,

25:59.267 --> 26:03.063
and now, he's running.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.982
We are gonna find him, Cam.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.567
And what do you think's
gonna happen

26:07.609 --> 26:10.153
if he shoots
at the police again?

26:10.195 --> 26:13.782
Please.

26:13.823 --> 26:14.908
- Move.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.409
- I know I got it wrong.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.995
Cam, I see that now.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.121
I know you were
trying to stop him,

26:20.163 --> 26:21.956
and he was just
trying to protect you.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.500
- Because he always
protects me.

26:23.541 --> 26:26.336
He always does,
so leave, please.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.671
Please!

26:27.712 --> 26:30.173
- He killed two people, Cam.

26:30.215 --> 26:33.093
And he's running.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.720
This is not gonna end well.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.434
- So then what the hell
do you want from me?

26:41.476 --> 26:48.608
* *

26:50.735 --> 26:55.448
- I want you to
protect him now.

26:55.490 --> 26:59.411
I want you to help me
find him...

26:59.452 --> 27:03.081
so no one else gets hurt,
and we fix this.

27:11.756 --> 27:11.923
.

27:11.965 --> 27:12.966
- The brothers have
always had a plan.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.301
If either of them were
to ever get into trouble,

27:15.343 --> 27:16.594
they meet at Humboldt Park.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.887
- It was their favorite place
to go as kids.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.015
Derrick used to repeat it
to Cam like a refrain.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.933
If there's trouble,
meet at the lagoon.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.226
- Hmm.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.561
- But Cam doesn't even
have a way to contact him

27:24.602 --> 27:26.104
or confirm the location,
does he?

27:26.146 --> 27:27.522
- No, but he doesn't think
his brother

27:27.564 --> 27:28.898
would ever leave town
without him.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.233
He'll be there
at the park hiding,

27:30.275 --> 27:31.401
waiting for Cam to show up.

27:31.443 --> 27:32.736
- That park's 200 acres.

27:32.777 --> 27:35.864
That's a lot of space
to shut down clean.

27:35.905 --> 27:39.909
- Not necessarily,
not if we put Cam in.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.911
We bring Cam with us.
We put him at the lagoon.

27:41.953 --> 27:44.039
We secure the area
with undercovers.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.458
When Derrick shows up,
we take him quickly--

27:46.499 --> 27:48.418
nice and quiet, no chaos.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.211
- And Cam is fit to do this?

27:50.253 --> 27:51.421
- He agreed.

27:51.463 --> 27:53.048
- That's not what I asked.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.759
- He's medically cleared,
and he wants to do this.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.802
He wants to make it right.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.432
- All right, put him in play.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.267
But I want Tact teams
around the corner

28:04.309 --> 28:07.187
ready to crash if it flips.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.406
[suspenseful music]

28:18.448 --> 28:25.580
* *

28:34.839 --> 28:36.841
- Possible eyes on Derrick.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.552
West side, ground level,
near the boathouse.

28:49.688 --> 28:51.272
- Derrick, run!
Police!

28:51.314 --> 28:52.482
Run!

28:52.524 --> 28:54.984
[dramatic music]

28:55.026 --> 28:57.195
- Got eyes on the target
moving eastbound

28:57.237 --> 28:59.072
toward the boathouse,
black jacket, jeans.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.615
All units move in.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.879
- Derrick!

29:20.969 --> 29:23.013
[gunshots]

29:24.556 --> 29:26.599
Derrick!
Drop your weapon!

29:26.641 --> 29:28.810
Get your hands up
and drop your weapon now.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.104
The whole place is
surrounded here.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.313
Cam, stop!

29:32.355 --> 29:33.690
Roll!

29:33.732 --> 29:36.317
[gunshots]

29:39.237 --> 29:42.449
Derrick, every inch of this
place is surrounded by police.

29:42.490 --> 29:46.578
The only path through is coming
out with your hands held high.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.663
You and your brother
both know that.

29:48.705 --> 29:52.459
We don't want to hurt you.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.377
Cam?

29:54.419 --> 29:58.173
Cam, please talk to me.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.301
I'm gonna need one of you
to talk to me.

30:01.343 --> 30:05.805
Tell me what you need
to walk out of here.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.061
Thanks.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.313
They're barricaded in.
They're not responding.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.357
I can hear them talking,
but I can't make out

30:15.398 --> 30:16.524
what they're saying.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.234
And I don't think
anybody else is in there.

30:18.276 --> 30:20.653
- We got every exit locked up,
and there ain't no way out.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.822
- We could create a diversion,
make some noise at the slips,

30:22.864 --> 30:24.199
crash through the back.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.284
- We crash now, one of them's
gonna end up dead.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.536
- They're not responding.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.997
Look, the only other option
is call in a negotiator,

30:31.039 --> 30:32.665
hope to hell they connect,

30:32.707 --> 30:35.835
but that'll draw
this thing way out.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.755
- I think I may know
somebody that'll connect,

30:38.797 --> 30:41.925
somebody he'll talk to.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.301
This is just a precaution.

30:43.343 --> 30:44.761
I'll be right beside you
the whole time

30:44.803 --> 30:46.262
and will be covered.

30:46.304 --> 30:47.722
But you don't move
unless I tell you to, OK?

30:47.764 --> 30:49.724
- Yeah.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.102
- Goal is to get
Derrick and Cam talking.

30:52.143 --> 30:55.605
Keep them calm, connect,
empathize, and talk them out.

30:55.647 --> 30:57.941
Cam trusted you, I think.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.402
Hopefully, Derrick will too.

31:00.443 --> 31:02.570
Are you OK?
You good?

31:02.612 --> 31:04.280
- Yeah.
Just tell me where to go.

31:04.322 --> 31:06.116
Let's go.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.080
- Derrick Boyd?

31:14.749 --> 31:16.876
My name is Dr. Mitchell.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.421
I'm here to help you.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.550
Derrick, I'm gonna
need a response from you

31:23.591 --> 31:28.388
so I know that you can hear me,
that you're safe.

31:28.430 --> 31:32.350
Can you hear me, Derrick?

31:32.392 --> 31:33.852
Cam?

31:33.893 --> 31:35.895
How about you, Cam?

31:35.937 --> 31:39.149
I'm the same doctor you met
outside those apartments.

31:39.190 --> 31:42.235
We spoke at the hospital.
I know you remember me.

31:44.362 --> 31:49.451
And, uh, I know this isn't
where either of you want to be.

31:49.492 --> 31:51.244
You don't want to talk to me.

31:51.286 --> 31:54.497
But let me be clear,
I'm not police.

31:54.539 --> 31:57.250
I'm here for your physical
and mental well-being,

31:57.292 --> 31:59.711
nothing else.

32:03.381 --> 32:05.175
Look, I need to know
you're both safe in there.

32:05.216 --> 32:08.845
Can you tell me
that you're safe?

32:08.887 --> 32:10.180
Cam?
- We're fine.

32:10.221 --> 32:13.141
We just want to be alone.

32:13.183 --> 32:16.895
So we don't need any help.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.897
- Hey, hey, Cam.

32:18.938 --> 32:22.567
Good. Good.
I'm glad that you're good.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.361
Tell me what you need, Cam.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.071
- I--I--I don't
need anything.

32:26.112 --> 32:29.157
I just--I--I want
everyone to leave.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.284
- Man. [chuckles]
I get that.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.286
And I wish the police
could leave too,

32:33.328 --> 32:36.498
but that one,
I can't do for you.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.875
Here's what I can do.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.877
I know that if you and Derrick
walk out of there

32:40.919 --> 32:42.295
with your hands raised,

32:42.337 --> 32:43.630
the police here
are gonna let you leave

32:43.672 --> 32:46.216
this boathouse safely.
- No, no, no, no! No!

32:46.257 --> 32:48.468
We need--we need to go home!

32:48.510 --> 32:51.388
Make them--make them
let us go home.

32:51.429 --> 32:56.768
- Ah, I wish I could guarantee
you that, but I can't.

33:00.188 --> 33:04.067
I can't control what the
police do and neither can you.

33:04.109 --> 33:07.112
But we can control
what you and I do.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.073
And I know I can protect you
and your brother's safety

33:10.115 --> 33:12.534
right now and once you
leave this boathouse.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.577
I will help you.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.079
I will help you get care.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.331
I will help you get well.

33:18.373 --> 33:21.710
I promise you that.

33:21.751 --> 33:28.883
* *

33:31.344 --> 33:33.471
- OK.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.851
We're coming out now.

33:41.479 --> 33:43.106
- OK, Cam.

33:43.148 --> 33:46.276
Come out with your
hands first, OK?

33:48.028 --> 33:50.864
Nice and slow.

33:50.905 --> 33:52.282
That's great.

33:52.323 --> 33:55.952
That's great.
Let me see your hands.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.370
That's great.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.539
OK.
Step out.

33:59.581 --> 34:01.332
Step out towards me.

34:01.374 --> 34:03.168
OK.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.627
It's OK.

34:04.669 --> 34:07.130
It's OK.

34:07.172 --> 34:11.343
It's OK.
Just come towards me.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.303
OK.
It's OK.

34:13.345 --> 34:14.846
Come on.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.473
It's OK.

34:19.142 --> 34:23.688
Derrick, let me see your hands.

34:23.730 --> 34:27.901
Derrick, hands first.

34:27.942 --> 34:29.486
Let's see your hands.
Derrick.

34:29.527 --> 34:31.196
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Derrick, put the gun down.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.615
[gunshot]
No! Derrick!

34:33.656 --> 34:36.534
[Cam screaming and sobbing]

34:43.166 --> 34:47.170
- He said--he said--he said
it was the only way.

34:47.212 --> 34:48.672
He said it was.
He said it was.

34:48.713 --> 34:53.343
He said he couldn't protect,
that he can't help me.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.095
[whimpering]

34:55.136 --> 34:56.971
Please, he said
that you'd help me.

34:57.013 --> 34:58.223
Please.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.517
He said you'd help me.

35:00.558 --> 35:02.310
[crying]

35:23.456 --> 35:23.623
.

35:23.665 --> 35:24.290
- Just got word from Med.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.129
Jess is still holding on.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.715
Dr. Mitchell got Cam to admit
himself as an inpatient,

35:31.756 --> 35:35.885
so he's gonna get the
help that he needs.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.805
- That's good.
For how long?

35:38.847 --> 35:40.557
- It's actually hard to say
because the hospital

35:40.598 --> 35:42.308
is overcrowded,
Cam doesn't have insurance.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.936
But Dr. Mitchell said
he's gonna do his best.

35:44.978 --> 35:47.439
I think his best
is pretty good.

35:49.774 --> 35:52.068
Also, Burge and I are
down to stay and help you

35:52.110 --> 35:54.070
with that paperwork.

35:54.112 --> 35:55.905
I mean, maybe we can get
some drinks afterwards,

35:55.947 --> 35:57.449
unwind a little bit.

36:00.243 --> 36:02.954
- Uh, I got it.
It's OK. Thanks.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.330
I won't take that long.
- I know.

36:04.372 --> 36:07.208
But you know, we got you.
We down to stay.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.877
- That's all right.

36:08.918 --> 36:10.670
Thank you though.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.589
Have a good night.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.133
- You too.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.515
- Long day.

36:22.557 --> 36:24.017
- [chuckles]

36:24.059 --> 36:26.644
- How about you stay one more
minute and give me a name?

36:26.686 --> 36:28.188
Look--
- [sighs]

36:28.229 --> 36:30.732
- It's just to show
we're moving on for now.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.068
I need a name, Hank.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.652
- Adam.

36:34.694 --> 36:37.280
It's the only name you're
gonna get from me, Trudy.

36:40.075 --> 36:42.619
It's Adam's spot.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.163
[sighs]

37:03.598 --> 37:06.518
[pensive music]

37:06.559 --> 37:13.525
* *

37:26.121 --> 37:29.332
[objects clatter]

37:29.374 --> 37:32.210
- [shaky breathing]

37:51.563 --> 37:53.773
Oh!

37:53.815 --> 37:55.692
[knocking on door]

37:55.734 --> 37:58.737
Yeah. One sec.

38:03.074 --> 38:04.784
Hey.
- Hey.

38:04.826 --> 38:07.203
- What are you doing here?

38:07.245 --> 38:10.457
Sorry, were you
trying to call me?

38:10.498 --> 38:11.791
- Nope.

38:11.833 --> 38:15.045
- Oh, uh--it's OK, I got that.

38:15.086 --> 38:19.299
- No, it's fine.

38:19.341 --> 38:20.759
Here we go.
- I got it. I got it.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.093
You're not cleaning up
my apartment.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.429
I got it.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.897
- You've been here six months?

38:33.938 --> 38:36.691
- Yeah.

38:36.733 --> 38:39.903
Um, I'll get you
something to drink.

38:39.944 --> 38:43.823
I think I--I only have
whatever this thing is, but--

38:43.865 --> 38:46.201
- I don't need one.

38:49.371 --> 38:52.457
What happened to the lamp?

38:54.209 --> 38:57.128
- [sighs]

39:00.548 --> 39:02.926
We don't have to do all this.

39:02.967 --> 39:04.761
- Yeah, I know we don't.

39:04.803 --> 39:08.139
I know.

39:08.181 --> 39:12.227
- I'm--I'm good.

39:12.268 --> 39:14.938
I'll be good.
Just had a moment.

39:14.979 --> 39:17.023
I'm always the calmest
person in the room.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.608
I'll get that back.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.694
- Hailey...

39:20.735 --> 39:22.278
[clicks tongue]

39:22.320 --> 39:24.656
We all miss things.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.075
- I don't.

39:27.117 --> 39:30.995
Not like that.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.748
I wasn't calm with Cam.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.251
It was all right there
in front of me.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.795
He was telling me
in the interview room,

39:38.837 --> 39:40.338
and I missed it.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.841
- And it might have
ended the same.

39:42.882 --> 39:45.176
- Or it might not have.

39:45.218 --> 39:47.387
- Hmm.

39:47.429 --> 39:50.974
- I was angry at him.

39:51.016 --> 39:54.978
He seemed proud,
and I got angry.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.521
And lately, I--

39:56.563 --> 39:58.648
I don't know if
I'm not shutting down.

39:58.690 --> 40:02.068
I'm angry,
and I don't know why.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.738
I'm not mad at Jay.

40:04.779 --> 40:07.532
[chuckles]
I'm really not.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.577
I just--I should be good.

40:10.618 --> 40:14.581
I don't--should be
moving on by now.

40:14.622 --> 40:17.584
We all should be
moving on, right?

40:17.625 --> 40:20.712
But I'm not,
and I don't know why.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.548
And I--pff.

40:26.551 --> 40:30.263
I wasn't paying attention
with Cam.

40:30.305 --> 40:34.351
And I can't be a good cop
if I'm angry.

40:34.392 --> 40:36.728
I don't know what to do.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.232
- [sighs]

40:41.274 --> 40:43.860
- Tell me what to do.

40:46.613 --> 40:48.990
That's why you're here, right?

40:51.201 --> 40:52.535
I'm serious.

40:52.577 --> 40:55.205
Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

40:55.246 --> 40:56.289
Anything.

40:56.331 --> 40:59.876
- [sighs]

40:59.918 --> 41:01.753
- How do I fix it?

41:01.795 --> 41:08.760
* *

41:10.261 --> 41:12.931
- I don't know.

41:57.392 --> 42:00.520
[wolf howls]
