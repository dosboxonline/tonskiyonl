01:28.671 --> 01:30.256
<i>♪ Dress yourself to kill ♪</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:57.700
I talked Zarkarian down
to a reasonable rate.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.202
In your name.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.204
You did?

02:02.664 --> 02:03.664
Why?

02:03.665 --> 02:06.959
Because you're Cobra Kai again.
And what better way to kick things off

02:06.960 --> 02:09.336
than by training Miguel and Tory
for their final matches

02:09.337 --> 02:10.839
right back where it all began?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.970
You know, first time I saw that logo here,

02:17.679 --> 02:20.890
it brought up
some pretty visceral emotions.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.893
I know this style of karate
will always exist.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.896
And even though I don't believe in it,

02:28.189 --> 02:29.315
I do believe in you.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.569
Means a lot, man.

02:34.737 --> 02:38.449
Just putting that snake on my back again
so Tory and Miguel can have their shot

02:39.159 --> 02:40.034
is one thing,

02:41.035 --> 02:42.996
but bringing Cobra Kai back all the way

02:43.538 --> 02:45.623
after what Kreese and Silver
turned it into...

02:47.125 --> 02:48.418
They did a lot of damage.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.922
But if you could lead Tory and Miguel
to victory tomorrow,

02:54.299 --> 02:57.718
your Cobra Kai will be
Sekai Taikai champions.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.305
That's what it'll be known for.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.975
And you'll be the sensei
who made it happen.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.769
Clean slate.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.444
This feeling like a yes?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.030
It's a hell yeah.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.082
They think they can pull this stunt
at the eleventh hour.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.125
They'd lost!

03:30.126 --> 03:31.501
This thing was over.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.337
That title was ours.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.089
The title is still ours.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.759
Losing should be
the least of their concerns.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.719
Ais!

03:42.388 --> 03:44.014
Axel, Wing.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.314
<i>Kai shi!</i>

04:06.454 --> 04:07.372
Hold.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.583
What was that?

04:11.334 --> 04:12.960
A... a point, Sensei.

04:12.961 --> 04:17.714
A point that your opponent
can now recover to regain

04:17.715 --> 04:20.635
when you could have
ended the fight for good.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.471
I... I don't want to win that way.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.735
<i>Kai shi.</i>

04:41.030 --> 04:42.991
There is no way.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.412
There is only winning or not.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.329
This isn't a sport.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.957
It's a fight.

04:51.541 --> 04:57.463
Your opponents refuse to accept defeat,
so you will not give them a choice.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.507
Eyes on me!

05:01.009 --> 05:02.427
You will not hold back.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.262
Not out of empathy.

05:05.263 --> 05:10.684
Or out of concern
for Samantha LaRusso's opinion of you.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.150
You think I don't see
the way you look at her?

05:17.817 --> 05:20.737
The Miyagi-Do captain

05:21.487 --> 05:24.991
who disgraced her dojo
by refusing to fight?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.201
Look me in the eye.

05:29.162 --> 05:33.666
Does this girl
mean more to you than victory?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.503
Because if the answer is yes...

05:41.215 --> 05:42.467
you've already lost.

05:43.926 --> 05:47.387
We do not seek the approval of the weak.

05:52.894 --> 05:53.978
They should fear you.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.272
And if they don't...

05:59.067 --> 06:00.568
make them.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.402
Yes, Sensei.

06:05.114 --> 06:05.948
Again!

06:13.956 --> 06:15.458
This is where it all started.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.836
Diaz, you were my first student.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.049
Nichols, I was your first sensei.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.551
I taught you the style of karate
that was taught to me.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.389
We've been through a lot
of Cobra Kai bullshit since then.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.723
But none of that matters.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.102
Because this is our Cobra Kai.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.311
And tomorrow,

06:36.312 --> 06:39.356
we're gonna show the world
that nobody strikes harder than us.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.524
Is that understood?

06:40.525 --> 06:41.817
Yes, Sensei!

06:41.818 --> 06:42.735
Good.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.364
Now let's show
these international assholes

06:47.365 --> 06:48.616
how we do things in the Valley.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.163
Imagine your opponent's face.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.960
Keep going. Fifty more. Fifty more!

07:02.171 --> 07:03.840
Ais!

07:05.091 --> 07:06.801
Come on, don't be pussies. Let's go!

07:07.343 --> 07:09.345
Oh, hell yeah. Now we're talking.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.723
Nice, Diaz!

07:13.724 --> 07:14.683
Attagirl!

07:18.563 --> 07:20.481
All right, it's time to lay some wood!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.086
That's nice, nice.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.503
Hands up!

08:09.280 --> 08:10.530
Thanks, Sensei. I'm good.

08:10.531 --> 08:14.994
Hey, you worked your ass off. Build
those muscles back up. Get some protein.

08:15.578 --> 08:20.166
I guess there is some protein in that,
but... I don't have much of an appetite.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.254
Don't tell me you're getting the prefight
jitters. You've never looked better.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.718
Too much adrenaline. I guess I just...

08:32.637 --> 08:34.972
can't wait to pay back Axel
for what he did to Robby.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.642
I get it.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.480
But you can't go into this fight
thinking like that.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.734
I should know.
I go into every fight thinking like that.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.530
It's also how I lost to LaRusso in '84.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.032
I was a way better fighter.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.869
Yeah, sure, maybe he's caught up
since then. Almost.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.958
But he only trained for six weeks.
I should have destroyed him.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.127
I was too hellbent on revenge
for all the shit he pulled.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.507
Even though I pulled a lot of shit on him,
too, he didn't fight for revenge.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.094
He fought to honor
everything he'd learned.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.223
To show guys like me
we couldn't get the best of him.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.935
Understood, Sensei.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.189
I'm gonna fight to honor
everything you taught me.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.738
Being your sensei
is the best thing I've ever done.

09:35.866 --> 09:36.909
Do me a favor.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.453
Fight for yourself too.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.417
To honor how far you've come.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.214
The day we met, you were wearing
Pepto-Bismol as a hat. Right over there.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.969
A few months later,
you're All-Valley champ.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.431
Now you're on the verge of a world title.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.767
You're Miguel fucking Diaz.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.312
You earned this.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.149
You understand?

10:10.610 --> 10:11.444
Got it.

10:12.987 --> 10:13.821
Good.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.034
- Now give me one of those slices.
- Attaboy.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.621
<i>My dad learned this in Okinawa.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:24.332
It's sort of a last resort.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.166
Is there a counter to it?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.543
Ask the drum.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.546
Haven't you two
gotten your fill of training for the day?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.925
Hey, if you love karate,
you can never get too much of it.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.136
Unless, of course,
it's the night before a title fight.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.639
You want us to give you a lift home?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.681
Uh, no, that's okay.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.601
Sensei Lawrence and Robby
are gonna give me a ride. But thanks.

10:44.602 --> 10:48.189
Okay. It's a big day tomorrow,
so try to get your rest.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.443
Everything okay?

10:53.444 --> 10:54.362
Yeah.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.741
I was just thinking
about the first time I came in here.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.827
Sparred with Miguel
and made friends with Aisha.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.664
Then met Sam at the beach club.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.250
It's been a strange couple of years.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.170
The toughest in my life.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.131
But also kind of the best.

11:15.549 --> 11:20.553
And when I think about the good parts,
a lot of them are because of you guys.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.102
You helped me get back into school
after all the shit that I pulled on Sam.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.064
And you let me join Miyagi-Do,
no questions asked.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.233
And then I bailed on you
right before the tournament

11:33.234 --> 11:34.317
to fight for Kreese.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.279
And now Sam's teaching me
the advanced moves of Miyagi-Do.

11:38.614 --> 11:42.867
No one besides my mom
has ever shown me that much kindness.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.829
So... thank you.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.624
I don't know what I did to deserve it.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.293
Well, I'll tell you what you did.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.881
You took every punch that life threw you,
and you kept fighting.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.427
Sure, I didn't always agree
with the way that you fought,

12:00.428 --> 12:03.305
but... we all make mistakes.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.225
Even me, some would argue.

12:08.018 --> 12:12.063
What matters is how willing we are
to acknowledge those mistakes

12:12.064 --> 12:13.733
and how we move on from them.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.361
And you've done that
better than most people.

12:17.903 --> 12:18.904
You both have.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.449
So,

12:22.491 --> 12:25.411
yes, you absolutely deserve
some good in your life.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.706
Just like you deserve to win.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.635
We just rolled in to the Sekai Taikai.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.972
Ignore her bullshit.
Keep your head in the game.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.729
<i>All dojo representatives</i>...

12:52.730 --> 12:56.775
Hey, hey. Sorry I'm late.
I was changing my number for next year.

12:56.776 --> 13:01.237
As much as I'll miss dear old 818,
626 has a much better ring to it.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.198
Wait, 626 is Pasadena.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.075
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I not tell you?

13:05.701 --> 13:06.618
I got into Caltech.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.328
Dude, what? Are you serious?

13:08.329 --> 13:12.081
As the cancer we may very well cure
one day via nanobot technology.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.459
But what about TMI?

13:14.043 --> 13:16.753
Oh. Oh, sweet, sweet Moon.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.380
It's MIT.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.131
No shit.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.509
We've just been calling it TMI
behind your back all year

13:22.510 --> 13:24.302
because you wouldn't shut up about it.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.262
Fair.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.807
And I told MIT thanks, but no thanks.

13:28.808 --> 13:33.020
At the end of the day, Caltech's
robotics program is a notch above.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.314
Plus, my best friend is going there.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.983
Binary Brothers for life.

13:39.026 --> 13:43.321
Ladies and gentlemen,
please find your seats.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.868
The girls' final match
will begin momentarily.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.872
Just focus on what you need to do
out there and nothing else. Both of you.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.167
Don't worry about overall points.
Just win your fight.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.544
- Okay?
- No.

13:58.754 --> 14:02.091
There's no way in hell we're letting
Silver buy himself another title.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.094
He's right. We can close the gap.

14:06.053 --> 14:06.887
Badass.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.599
Who is ready for karate?

14:12.810 --> 14:17.272
Our championship bout will follow
the same structure as our semifinals.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.481
Three rounds,

14:18.482 --> 14:21.818
two minutes each, with unlimited scoring.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.070
Knockdowns are worth ten points,

14:24.071 --> 14:29.784
and if a downed fighter
cannot reengage within ten seconds,

14:29.785 --> 14:32.537
they will be considered knocked out

14:32.538 --> 14:36.416
and their opponent awarded 20 points.

14:36.417 --> 14:40.086
She cannot match your speed or your skill.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.924
And don't let her forget how much
real estate you own in her head either.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.594
The individual title
goes to the competitor

14:47.595 --> 14:51.139
who scores the most points
over these three rounds.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.515
Nichols, it's go time.

14:52.516 --> 14:57.061
And now, the final match
to determine our female world champion.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.983
Please come to the mat,
Tory Nichols of Cobra Kai.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.859
Let's go, Tory!

15:02.860 --> 15:05.029
And Zara Malik
of the Iron Dragons.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.323
Good luck to you both.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.455
Just wanted to say thanks

15:15.456 --> 15:18.542
for that little stunt
you pulled on my social back in Spain.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.379
Played the slut shaming card,
doubled my followers.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.797
What an achievement.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.674
Play it cool all you want,

15:26.675 --> 15:30.261
but we both know it eats you up
that, no matter what happens,

15:30.262 --> 15:31.722
everyone still loves me,

15:33.057 --> 15:34.433
and they'll never love you.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.435
Don't let her push your buttons.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.645
Look around.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.188
You've got home field advantage,

15:40.189 --> 15:43.566
but most of these sad little people
from your sad little Valley

15:43.567 --> 15:44.777
are cheering for me.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.820
So enjoy the last
of your 15 minutes of fame

15:47.821 --> 15:52.076
because all you'll be after this
is just another notch on my black belt.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.078
Kind of like Robby.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.210
Fighters, face me. Bow.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.712
Each other, bow.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.590
Fighting stances.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.341
Ready?

16:08.342 --> 16:10.093
Let's go, Nichols. She's all yours.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.973
Fight!

16:22.439 --> 16:23.816
Point!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.527
You have to try harder than that.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.618
No point.
That's a kick to the back.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.633
- Shit.
- No point. Block.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.926
Focus, Nichols.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.137
Zara got in her head.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.897
Point!

17:06.900 --> 17:08.276
Point!

17:11.321 --> 17:16.325
Point!

17:16.326 --> 17:17.494
Damn it!

17:20.247 --> 17:23.459
- She's playing right into her hands.
- Tory will calm down and figure it out.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.172
Right?

17:28.672 --> 17:29.964
Shake it off. Shake it off.

17:29.965 --> 17:33.010
You're only down five, all right?
That's not even a touchdown.

17:34.344 --> 17:38.598
Plenty of time to come back. She's baiting
you. All right? Making you gas out.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.518
You gotta flip the script.
Let her come to you.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.896
Zara! Zara! Zara!

17:44.897 --> 17:48.941
When she's airborne, she's vulnerable.
And she loves to show that shit off.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.903
Make her pay for it. Be ready for it.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.530
Hey, Dad, can I have a second?

17:54.990 --> 17:55.866
Yeah.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.203
You gonna tell me to stay centered
and find my balance?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.370
Because I would if I could,

18:01.371 --> 18:04.415
but I need her to stay still so I can
give her the beating she's got coming.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.001
- I wasn't gonna say any of that.
- So what, then?

18:07.002 --> 18:09.712
You got some genius strategy
for how to hit a human tornado

18:09.713 --> 18:12.006
who blows kisses to her fans
while kicking me in the face?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.717
- No, I don't.
- Then what?

18:17.805 --> 18:18.846
I love you, Tory.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.813
That's all I was gonna tell you.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.675
That's it?

18:55.801 --> 18:56.677
Yeah.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.264
And no fucking mercy.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.228
Come on!

19:10.232 --> 19:11.899
- Let's go, Tory.
- Come on!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.656
Fighting stances.

19:19.032 --> 19:19.867
Ready!

19:25.289 --> 19:26.664
Fight!

19:52.107 --> 19:53.608
- Point!
- Yes!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.368
Point!

20:17.966 --> 20:19.342
Knockdown. Ten points.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.468
- Yes!
- Yes, Tory!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.896
Another point!

20:36.151 --> 20:37.652
- Knockdown. Ten points.
- Yeah!

20:37.653 --> 20:39.403
Get up!

21:01.635 --> 21:03.010
Knockout. Winner!

21:03.011 --> 21:04.762
She did it!

21:04.763 --> 21:07.473
Yeah! Let's go!

21:10.352 --> 21:11.602
Welcome to the Valley.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.273
Bitch.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.567
Come on, up.
Let's get you off to the side.

21:34.126 --> 21:40.590
Congratulations
to our new Sekai Taikai girls' champion,

21:41.091 --> 21:43.760
Tory Nichols.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.221
Yeah!

21:47.222 --> 21:54.478
Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory!

21:54.479 --> 21:55.731
With her win,

21:56.273 --> 22:00.526
Cobra Kai is closing the gap
on the Iron Dragons.

22:00.527 --> 22:04.489
We'll take a short intermission
before our final event,

22:05.323 --> 22:07.158
the boys' championship.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.244
- All right! Whoo!
- Yeah!

22:15.292 --> 22:16.168
Okay.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.100
Okinawa?

22:47.491 --> 22:48.742
That was some match.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.996
Underdog looks down and out
but comes back to win decisively.

22:53.997 --> 22:54.831
Congratulations.

22:55.916 --> 22:56.875
Oh, w-- wait.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.294
That wasn't your victory.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.922
One of your captains
got carried off the mat.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.633
The other one didn't even show up.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.303
That's how Miyagi-Do will be remembered.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.388
I'd love to see the look
on your sensei's face

23:11.389 --> 23:15.894
if he were alive to see me destroy
everything you've worked for.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.146
It ain't over yet.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.899
Might as well be.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.109
Axel's a machine.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.152
You saw how he dominated Keene,

23:25.153 --> 23:28.490
and he is going to decimate Diaz.

23:29.074 --> 23:33.161
But let's just say you're right,
and by some miracle, he pulls it off.

23:34.496 --> 23:38.290
That'll be Cobra Kai on that podium.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.628
The dojo you thought you'd killed
once and for all.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.966
That's gotta hurt, Danny boy.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.010
Actually,

23:50.053 --> 23:51.221
it doesn't hurt at all.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.598
Haven't you heard?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.435
Cobra Kai

23:57.644 --> 23:58.853
never dies.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.241
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.619
- You okay?
- Yeah. Um...

24:17.205 --> 24:19.332
Honestly, I just don't know
how else to say it. Uh...

24:19.833 --> 24:22.669
I saw your acceptance letter
to the exchange program in Okinawa.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.503
- Shit.
- And, um--

24:24.504 --> 24:28.299
Miguel, I... I just didn't wanna
say anything until after.

24:28.300 --> 24:32.553
It's fine. We didn't promise we were gonna
be in the same place after high school.

24:32.554 --> 24:36.057
It just, uh... seemed like
it might end up that way.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.562
Even though Okinawa's a bit further
of a commute than Stanford, but...

24:42.606 --> 24:43.982
It sounds super cool.

24:44.566 --> 24:48.611
And you must be so pumped.
I mean, I'm happy for you.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.696
I'm really happy.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.116
More than anything,
I just want what's best for you.

24:54.326 --> 24:58.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
please return to your seats.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.540
I wanna hear all about it, okay,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.168
right after I'm done kicking some ass.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.182
And now...

25:19.142 --> 25:21.227
...our final match

25:21.228 --> 25:27.234
of this year's Sekai Taikai!

25:28.276 --> 25:33.240
Representing the Iron Dragons,
Axel Kovačević!

25:35.200 --> 25:41.038
And representing Cobra Kai, Miguel Diaz.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.541
This is what it's all about.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.042
Savor the moment.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.045
And knock his block off.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259
No matter what <i>gi</i> he has on,

25:53.176 --> 25:54.719
he's trained in Miyagi-Do.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.517
And after what you've done to his friend,
he'll be on the defense.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.480
But there is no defense
for what you are about to do.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.150
Would the fighters
please come to the mat.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.658
Good luck to both of you.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.201
Go, Miguel!

26:26.793 --> 26:28.377
Fighters, face me.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.379
Bow.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.299
Face each other. Bow.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.427
Fighting stances.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.511
Ais!

26:41.600 --> 26:42.683
Fight!

26:46.688 --> 26:47.855
- Point!
- Nice, Diaz!

26:47.856 --> 26:49.690
- Come on, Miguel!
- Ais!

26:56.531 --> 26:57.364
Point!

26:57.365 --> 26:58.449
Go, Miggy!

27:07.292 --> 27:09.044
Ais! Ais! Ais!

27:09.919 --> 27:11.295
Ais!

27:18.637 --> 27:21.055
Point!

27:35.570 --> 27:36.904
- Point!
- Yeah, Miguel!

27:36.905 --> 27:39.156
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

27:39.157 --> 27:40.450
Good job, Miguel!

27:45.705 --> 27:47.665
- Holy shit, Diaz. You're on fire.
- Thanks.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.583
All right.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.880
First Malik, now Kovačević?

27:55.298 --> 27:56.716
What the hell's wrong with them?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.929
Flip his switch before he loses us
the whole goddamn tournament.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.192
You've been trained since you could walk.

28:15.193 --> 28:21.032
With every advantage
in size, strength, speed, and skill.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.913
Are you telling me
you can't beat a weak nobody

28:27.914 --> 28:29.457
from a nothing dojo?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.712
If you waste this opportunity,

28:34.629 --> 28:36.756
everything I've given you

28:37.882 --> 28:38.882
will be for nothing.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.388
If you let him win,

28:44.222 --> 28:47.142
you will be less than nothing.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.022
Come on, Miguel. You got this!

28:57.861 --> 28:58.987
Fighting stances.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.906
Ready? Fight!

29:15.211 --> 29:16.588
Point!

29:23.595 --> 29:24.429
Point!

29:24.929 --> 29:26.597
Point! Point!

29:32.604 --> 29:33.605
Another point!

29:42.989 --> 29:44.823
Boo!

29:47.535 --> 29:49.496
Knockdown. Ten points!

30:12.977 --> 30:14.646
- It's okay, man.
- It's okay.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.606
I'm so sorry, Sensei.
I... I thought I had him.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.567
- You did have him.
- Yeah.

30:20.568 --> 30:23.238
And then he had you. That's how fights go.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.407
That's how life goes.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.993
We all get our asses
handed to us sometimes.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.329
There's gonna be more
where that came from, I guarantee it.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.498
On and off the mat.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.959
But I've never known anyone
who could take a shit-kicking

30:36.960 --> 30:38.377
and fight back harder like you.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.465
Thanks, Sensei, but...

30:44.551 --> 30:47.803
I'm further behind on points. I don't know
if I can make it back in one round.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.556
Who gives a shit about the score?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.473
Points are for pussies.

30:51.474 --> 30:55.061
Just go out there and give them
the best two minutes of karate you got.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.271
Everything you learned.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.273
Every lesson.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.025
Every win. Every loss.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.111
Leave it all on the mat.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.779
Go all in!

31:05.488 --> 31:08.115
You go all in.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.452
Got it?

31:12.745 --> 31:13.580
Yeah.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.039
Yes, Sensei.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.207
Screw this headband.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.137
You're Cobra Kai.

31:38.104 --> 31:40.398
Kick his ass, Miggy!

31:45.403 --> 31:48.031
- Yeah, Miguel! You can do it!
- Come on!

31:53.620 --> 31:54.495
End this.

31:55.663 --> 31:56.705
Definitively.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.048
His spine has been injured once before.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.216
If targeted correctly,

32:07.884 --> 32:09.093
it can be broken.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.680
He leaves himself open for the roundhouse
when he pivots.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.058
I can beat him, Sensei. I don't need--

32:16.059 --> 32:18.185
What... was that?

32:23.024 --> 32:23.900
Yes, Sensei.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.166
Fighting stance.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.003
Ready?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.214
Fight!

32:56.182 --> 32:57.809
Point!

33:00.436 --> 33:01.353
I'm drowning.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.983
Drowning is for pussies, all right?
Don't be a pussy. Use your legs.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.276
Ais!

33:08.277 --> 33:10.279
Come on, princess.

33:11.447 --> 33:12.740
Harder!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.284
Point!

33:16.285 --> 33:17.828
- That's it. That's it!
- Come on!

33:24.043 --> 33:25.086
Let's go, Diaz!

33:25.753 --> 33:27.714
- Point!
- Good, good, good! Good!

33:31.843 --> 33:33.176
There it is!

33:33.177 --> 33:36.054
<i>He leaves himself open
for the roundhouse when he pivots.</i>

33:36.055 --> 33:38.932
<i>If targeted correctly, it can be broken.</i>

33:38.933 --> 33:40.892
Now! Now, now!

33:58.619 --> 34:00.245
- Ais!
- Point!

34:00.246 --> 34:01.204
- Yes!
- Let's go!

34:13.801 --> 34:14.676
Point!

34:25.605 --> 34:26.898
That's a point!

34:44.457 --> 34:45.541
Point!

34:46.459 --> 34:47.293
Point!

34:48.920 --> 34:49.795
Point!

34:49.796 --> 34:50.838
- That's right!
- Come on!

34:52.507 --> 34:53.341
Yeah!

34:55.218 --> 34:57.011
- Miguel?
- What?

34:59.347 --> 35:00.264
Am I doing it?

35:01.140 --> 35:01.974
You're doing it.

35:15.571 --> 35:17.072
Knockdown. Winner!

35:20.535 --> 35:21.452
Yes!

35:22.453 --> 35:23.412
Yeah!

35:24.914 --> 35:25.748
You did it!

35:26.374 --> 35:27.541
You did it, man.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.543
Hell yeah!

35:29.544 --> 35:31.878
You did it!

35:46.102 --> 35:47.353
Fantastic!

35:47.854 --> 35:48.813
Thank you, Sensei.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.941
I knew you could do it.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.277
- May I have your attention?
- Yeah!

35:55.278 --> 35:57.947
What an absolutely thrilling conclusion.

35:59.323 --> 36:04.620
Please join me in congratulating
our girls' and boys' champions,

36:05.413 --> 36:09.833
Tory Nichols and Miguel Diaz

36:09.834 --> 36:12.043
of Cobra Kai!

36:13.963 --> 36:16.340
- Yeah!
- Yes!

36:16.924 --> 36:18.342
- Whoo!
- Yes!

36:25.975 --> 36:28.811
I am ashamed to be your sensei.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.396
Go, Miguel!

36:30.897 --> 36:32.273
<i>You</i> are ashamed?

36:33.691 --> 36:35.318
I'm ashamed to be your student.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.821
But I never have to feel
that shame ever again.

36:44.827 --> 36:50.207
This leaves us only
to declare our overall dojo champion.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.336
But we cannot do that.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.381
Because, for the first time

36:58.424 --> 37:01.176
in our long and storied history,

37:01.177 --> 37:06.765
the Sekai Taikai has ended in a tie!

37:11.687 --> 37:12.604
What does that mean?

37:12.605 --> 37:17.652
Fortunately, we have a protocol in place
for just such an occasion.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.528
A winner must be proclaimed.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.323
Per tradition, our overall champion

37:23.324 --> 37:27.869
will be determined by one final match

37:27.870 --> 37:29.705
between the dojos.

37:31.165 --> 37:35.168
To be fought by their senseis!

37:43.052 --> 37:45.846
They've just given you your last chance.

37:48.015 --> 37:48.890
Don't blow it.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.318
Oh, I won't.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.072
- Whoa. Well, that was a twist.
- Hey.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.324
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.828
You worried?

38:09.412 --> 38:11.872
No. I know what I signed up for.

38:12.873 --> 38:15.334
- But are you?
- Why should he be worried?

38:16.919 --> 38:20.506
It's just karate.
What's the worst that could happen?

38:22.925 --> 38:24.635
Oh!

38:25.219 --> 38:26.721
Hey, little one.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.098
Beautiful.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.933
Congrats to both of you.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.143
And best of luck tomorrow.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.645
I bet you didn't expect
it all to be on your shoulders

38:35.646 --> 38:37.647
when you put that <i>gi</i> back on.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.026
But hey, that's life, isn't it?

38:41.777 --> 38:43.863
Full of unintended consequences.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.744
Aw. Bye-bye, sweetheart.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.293
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.592
Well, here we go again.

39:05.301 --> 39:06.469
Yeah.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.638
Never thought I'd be back on this mat.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.850
Listen, I know you just hung up your <i>gi,</i>

39:14.435 --> 39:16.228
but how about putting it on one more time?

39:17.188 --> 39:18.397
Be my sensei.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.776
I thought you'd never ask.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.336
I'm not leaving anything to chance.

39:42.421 --> 39:44.465
Lawrence doesn't have a prayer
in this fight.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.134
But neither did Diaz or Nichols.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.060
Johnny's built
a nice little family for himself.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.481
I suppose he'd do
just about anything for them.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.985
Especially if they were
to come under threat.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.658
Let's have you pay
his wife and daughter a little visit.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.285
Get us an insurance policy.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.497
Furniture stores are one thing.
Sure you wanna go there?

40:20.417 --> 40:21.669
Do as I ask,

40:22.711 --> 40:26.549
and this yacht's all yours
when I shuffle off this mortal coil.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.718
That's very generous of you, sir.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.055
- Sensei.
- My car's at the dock.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.890
Take the dinghy. Get it done.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.320
Watch the deck, Dennis.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.365
It's not yours yet.

41:17.766 --> 41:19.685
You should've stayed gone, John.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.023
And miss seeing your rent-a-dojo

41:24.857 --> 41:26.858
get beaten by Cobra Kai?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.652
You were there.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.448
I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.743
You always did love
lurking in the shadows.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.162
I hope it was worth it.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.707
'Cause you're not making it back to shore.

41:42.708 --> 41:43.834
Well, one of us isn't.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.213
I saw you talking to Johnny
on the way out.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.007
I recognize that look.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.385
So whatever it is that you got planned,

41:54.762 --> 41:56.179
it ain't gonna happen.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.516
Isn't that noble?

41:59.099 --> 42:00.726
And pathetic!

42:01.602 --> 42:03.228
After all this time,

42:03.229 --> 42:07.483
after he rejected you
over and over and over,

42:08.150 --> 42:11.861
you still can't shed that weakness.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.072
On the contrary.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.740
He's a source of strength.
He always has been.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.369
A student worthy of my dedication

42:19.870 --> 42:22.081
who has since surpassed his teacher.

42:22.831 --> 42:24.458
That's a low bar, John.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.045
His teacher isn't what he used to be.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.257
Let's find out.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.053
Yeah, let's.

42:37.304 --> 42:38.305
Really, Terry?

42:39.181 --> 42:40.683
I thought we were warriors.

42:41.183 --> 42:42.976
And warriors fight with honor.

42:42.977 --> 42:45.980
Warriors fight with whatever they have.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.151
Come on. Let's do this.

42:51.735 --> 42:52.736
So be it.

43:21.223 --> 43:22.808
Get up! Come on!

43:45.205 --> 43:49.460
Ah, yeah, this is how
it was always supposed to end, John.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.503
You've been fighting your whole life.

43:52.504 --> 43:55.381
It's only fitting
you go out on your shield.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.359
Don't worry. It'll all be over soon.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.535
No!

44:24.536 --> 44:26.246
Mercy!
