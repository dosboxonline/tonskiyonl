00:13.430 --> 00:15.432
[bebop music playing]

00:25.525 --> 00:26.609
[Jet] You hear that?

00:26.693 --> 00:29.320
He's playing triplets,
eighths and sixteenths.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.364
All in a single phrase. Whoo!

00:31.448 --> 00:34.909
All I hear is a bunch of random notes
that don't go with the melody.

00:34.993 --> 00:35.869
[Jet] It's the same melody.

00:35.952 --> 00:39.456
Bird's just playing it double time
and then throwing in a bluesy lick.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.459
-That's what makes the song genius.
-[Fad] It is genius.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.546
Until all that shameless,
squawking bullshit.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.591
Bird is composing on the spot. [scoffs]

00:50.216 --> 00:52.385
I got your Bird right here.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.182
Udai Taxim. Low-rent thug.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.517
There's surveillance of him
talking to our mark.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.395
[Jet] I, I know that shadow.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.397
And you know it because it's Duero.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.066
It's not Duero.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.817
[Fad] Duero's just bought a lake house.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.779
Can you afford a lake house
on your lieutenant's salary?

01:10.862 --> 01:11.905
[Jet] You know I can't.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.823
And Duero is a Cub Scout.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.034
All right. Who do you like? Phillips?

01:16.117 --> 01:18.536
No, it's not Phillips or Duero.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.413
[Fad] All right then, Sherlock,
give it to me.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.749
Chalmers.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.335
[scoffs, laughs] Chalmers?

01:25.418 --> 01:26.836
He's too perfect.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.006
I mean, nobody closes that many cases
without an inside line.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.427
This is Chalmers talking to Udai.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.097
I'm going to stick with my primary, Duero.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.432
I'd put money on it.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.517
Yeah?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.352
[laughs]

01:43.645 --> 01:44.854
I'll take your money.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.778
I've got a hard 2K says
Chalmers is our dirty cop.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.054
[gun cocks]

02:21.599 --> 02:24.102
[Fad] Getting Udai to name the actor
could get messy.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.147
Sure. But maybe he goes down easy.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.900
Speaking of names, Alisa and I picked one.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.861
Yeah? Uh. Give it to me.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.571
[Jet] Kimmie.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.448
[Fad] Kimmie, that's a great name.
Short for what?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.742
Kimberley? Kimbra? Kimble?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.287
-No, just Kimmie.
-Just Kimmie.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.748
[couple shouting indistinctly in distance]

03:00.013 --> 03:00.889
[door opening]

03:00.972 --> 03:02.724
-Police! Stay inside, ma'am.
-[woman gasps]

03:06.227 --> 03:08.855

-[growls softly]

03:25.038 --> 03:25.955

03:26.664 --> 03:27.498
[Jet groans]

03:31.169 --> 03:32.170
-[Fad groans]
-You all right?

03:32.253 --> 03:33.546
Yeah, good, go, go get him!

03:34.380 --> 03:35.381
Get him!

03:35.465 --> 03:36.883
[upbeat music playing]

03:57.153 --> 03:58.279
[grunts]

04:03.952 --> 04:05.036
[Jet grunts]

04:20.426 --> 04:21.261
Stop!

04:22.553 --> 04:23.554
It's over! [panting]

04:26.933 --> 04:28.184
Drop the iron, Udai!

04:33.356 --> 04:36.067
It's confession time.
Who are you working for?

04:37.193 --> 04:38.111
Who's the dirty cop?

04:48.079 --> 04:48.955
[groans]

04:59.215 --> 05:01.217
[somber music playing]

05:08.808 --> 05:10.810
[siren wailing in distance]

05:21.321 --> 05:23.323
[theme music playing]

06:55.415 --> 06:56.916
-[bebop music playing]
-[Jet groans]

06:56.999 --> 06:59.293
The entire movement
was a reaction to swing,

06:59.377 --> 07:01.504
which was dominated by propulsive rhythms.

07:01.587 --> 07:06.592
But in bebop, though, the emphasis
went from bass drum to hi-hat.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.096
Like in Parker's "Ko Ko,"
starts with a simple sax and trumpet,

07:10.179 --> 07:14.016
Bird and Dizz trading eight-bar phrases
and then bang!

07:14.809 --> 07:17.228
-Bird does a solo that just--
-[Spike] Jet.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.731
Is the thermal regulator down again?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.150
Not that I know of.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.611
There's not a drop of hot water
in those pipes.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.529
Ah, shit.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.489
[Faye] Sorry, guys. That's on me.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.451
I like my shower-bath-shower
scalding hot, so…

07:32.201 --> 07:33.202
[both] What?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.872
Shower-bath-shower.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.041
It's how you clean yourself.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.210
Seriously?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.087
Okay.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.882
Baths are great. But gross.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.802
Who wants to be in a tub full of hot water
stewing in their own filth?

07:49.886 --> 07:53.097
So you start by taking a shower
and wash all the grime off.

07:53.181 --> 07:58.019
And then you get in the tub,
at which point you shave, soap, exfoliate…

07:58.102 --> 07:59.979
-How long is she going to be here?
-I…

08:00.062 --> 08:02.190
By the way,
you two should really invest in a loofah.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.775
Now, after the deliciousness of the bath,

08:04.859 --> 08:08.029
you get back in the shower, rinse off,
ergo, shower-bath-shower.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.534
[inhales sharply] Were you two
raised by wolves?

08:16.078 --> 08:17.747
All right, here we go.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.374
[Ein whimpers]

08:21.083 --> 08:23.085
-[gunshot over TV]
-[peppy music playing]

08:23.169 --> 08:26.589
It's the big one, cowboys.
A prison ship has--

08:26.672 --> 08:29.800
A prison transport ship
has just crashed on Europa. So--

08:29.884 --> 08:32.345
[Judy] Prisoners are fleeing
in every direction.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.556
Well, you know what that means!
It's time for…

08:35.640 --> 08:37.099
-the leaderboard!
-[both] Leaderboard!

08:37.975 --> 08:39.519
[bell dings]

08:39.602 --> 08:41.020
Oh, there's gonna be
a lot of red meat out there.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.980
-Ah, it's a good day for the Bebop.
-Yeah.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.440
[Punch] These are hardened criminals

08:44.524 --> 08:46.651
straight from the prison colony
on Pluto, Judy.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.696
[Judy] And all the best cowboys
in the solar system are headed for Europa.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.948
How far is Europa?

08:52.031 --> 08:52.990
[sighs] Uh…

08:53.074 --> 08:57.703
Gate-to-Moon, we can get to Europa's
air space in 20, give or take.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.791
We have a laundry list of robbers,
drug dealers and killers. Judy?

09:01.874 --> 09:02.917
[Judy] The Sutherland Twins…

09:03.000 --> 09:06.087
Ah, The Sutherland arsonists,
we could take a run at them.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.171
Twins creep me out.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.799
[Judy] Fat Elvis,
a whopping 32 million woo.

09:09.882 --> 09:10.716
Good get.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.010
-[Judy] That really is a fat catch.
-[bell dings]

09:13.094 --> 09:15.888
-Tony the Chop. Forty million woolong.
-[both] Urgh.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.349
-[Jet] Ugly.
-Udai Taxim.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.434
Forty-five million woo.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.728
[echoing] Udai Taxim.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.398
Udai Taxim.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.067
Udai Taxim.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.069
[Jet exhales]

09:30.903 --> 09:32.655
-But the day is still young, Punch!
-[Spike] What is it?

09:32.738 --> 09:35.449
-[Punch] The day is still young, Judy…
-Where are you going?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.118
Hey! Where are you going?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.494
Out.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.163
You two, team up. Go grab some bounties.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.582
-With her?
-Team up?

09:42.665 --> 09:43.958
Yeah, team up.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.710
Every gun-toting cowboy's
gonna be looking to get

09:45.793 --> 09:46.877
a piece of this turkey shoot.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.589
Be a perfect storm
to catch a bullet in your ass.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.550
So pairing will be the best way
to cover your asses.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.260
Well, who's covering yours?

09:54.343 --> 09:55.386
[Jet] Don't worry about me.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.512
Yeah, but--

09:56.596 --> 09:58.639
I said team up.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.391
Now team up, God damn it!

10:01.767 --> 10:02.768
Okay.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.314
-What's up with your boy?
-I don't know.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.065
But he's got his cop face on.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.734
Meaning?

10:09.817 --> 10:12.903
Meaning when he gets like this,
it's just best to do what he says.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.489
[Judy and Punch] The Universal Cuff.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.909
Keeping bounties and cowboys together
across the universe!

10:18.993 --> 10:19.827
[Faye] Yeah.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.913
[upbeat music playing]

11:09.085 --> 11:10.378
[Jet] Udai's out.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.755
A-hole was on the prison transport ship
that crashed.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.050
Meet me at the place
near the thing we went to that time.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.177
I'll bring Udai's file.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.954
[car approaching]

12:02.763 --> 12:05.182
-What's with you and that tie?
-Ha!

12:05.266 --> 12:06.225
[laughs]

12:09.979 --> 12:12.273
-Ah.
-Ah, you look good. Fit.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.400
Guess cow-boying keeps you trim.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.402
Yeah. You got fat.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.946
-Oh.
-Maybe lay off of Connie's baked ziti?

12:19.029 --> 12:22.450
Hey, speaking of which,
she left two slices in my cooler for you.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.869
[Jet] That bet still on?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.413
Have we met?

12:27.997 --> 12:28.831
Good.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.417
Udai doesn't have
many friends in this city

12:31.500 --> 12:34.086
so I figure he's gonna try
and jump planet as fast as he can.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.296
How's he gonna do that?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.090
Spaceport's locked down
tighter than two coats of paint.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.175
Not with a new name.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.552
You remember that case
we worked in Salt City?

12:41.635 --> 12:45.556
Yeah, yeah, the White Tigers paper guy.
Uh, Donny? Danny?

12:45.639 --> 12:47.016
Yeah, Dagmar.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.477
Dagmar! You know what I remember?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.104
That guy broke his teeth
falling down a flight of stairs.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.774
I remember you
pushing him down said stairs.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.026
[both laugh]

12:57.109 --> 13:00.488
A bounty I nabbed a while back
said Dagmar got paroled and jumped here.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.449
Word on the street is
he's running an opium den in mid-town,

13:03.532 --> 13:04.825
but still doing papers in the back.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.745
-By the hummus place?
-Yeah.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.872
Want to go get some tzatziki?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.629
[jazz music playing]

13:18.380 --> 13:19.507
[laughs]

13:20.341 --> 13:23.344
Bird and Dizz at the Savoy
was the best record they ever made.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.846
That's because
Dizz played trumpet on every track.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.140
Bird playing the sax
is what made the damn record.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.851
I think that facial hair's
messing up your hearing.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.603
[Jet laughs] Ah…

13:33.187 --> 13:36.232
Look, all bullshitting aside,

13:36.816 --> 13:39.235
I've had a lot of time to think.
From all angles.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.487
Here's what I know.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.699
Chalmers pulled the trigger that night.
He set me up.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.660
He was the first on the scene

13:47.743 --> 13:49.662
and the one who made
the case that put me away.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.457
-And he's dating your ex?
-This isn't about that.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.336
It took me years
to earn my reputation as a good cop.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.548
And that smiling jackhole took it away.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.342
I want it back.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.263
For my daughter.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.809
Well, then let's go get it.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.769
[engine starts]

14:16.230 --> 14:17.439
[ship horn blowing]

14:19.191 --> 14:20.025
[gunshot on tv]

14:20.109 --> 14:22.319
[Spike] I think Ponzi Pete
is a solid choice.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.237
[blows raspberry]

14:23.320 --> 14:26.574
Please, I couldn't afford
a can of cat food with his reward money.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.993
Now T-Bone Wilson, I can get behind.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.828
-T-Bone eats people.
-So?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.372
So it took seven guys
to take him down the last time,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.791
-and he ate the faces off two of them.
-[whimpers]

14:35.875 --> 14:37.251
Yeah, but he's worth the most money.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
I like my face.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.713
So do many others.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.383
Hey, how about Jimmy Two-Shits?

14:44.466 --> 14:46.802
[Faye scoffs] We're chasing juvies now?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.804
[Spike] And you object on what grounds?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.348
Because I'm trying
to make some fat stacks.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.808
Oh. What about School Girl 5?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.560
[indistinct shouting on TV]

14:54.643 --> 14:55.978
Afraid the Ural beat you to it.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.022
[Judy] That's another 35 million woo
for Terpsichore.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.025
Jesus Christ.
They're snaking all the good ones.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.027
That's some bullshit.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.486
What are you doing?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.239
Uh, I'll tell you what I'm not gonna do

15:07.323 --> 15:09.783
is stick around here
with my thumb up my ass!

15:09.867 --> 15:12.161
-I'm going out.
-Hold on, hold on!

15:14.330 --> 15:15.247
Jet's right.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.042
It's gonna be
a shooting gallery out there.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.126
So let's just…

15:20.127 --> 15:22.129
Let's hunker down and we'll pick one.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.342
Fine.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.511
-[Punch] That's right, Judy.
-[Faye sighs]

15:29.595 --> 15:33.390
[Punch] In this here solar system,
coppers only pay out for live heads!

15:33.474 --> 15:35.017
[Faye] All right, let's go with…

15:35.100 --> 15:36.435
-Kangaroo Kid!
-Stoner Stu!

[Punch and Judy continue
speaking indistinctly on TV]

15:42.232 --> 15:43.275
I've got an idea.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.404
We shoot for it. Winner picks the bounty.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.369
[Vicious] Mao doesn't get
to set the terms.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.954
It's my goddamn meeting.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.124
Ana said Mao just wanted me there
for insurance.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.084
[Vicious sighs]

16:00.751 --> 16:02.169
Like she's afraid

16:03.170 --> 16:05.798
that I won't be able control myself.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.174
[Julia] She's just baiting you.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.096
Don't let her win.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.558
It hurts me

16:18.477 --> 16:21.021
to see you worry,

16:22.022 --> 16:24.775
like I'm incapable of keeping you safe.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.487
No, it's not that.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.536
It's just that
we only get one shot at Mao.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.999
So what we're about to do,

16:41.709 --> 16:43.669
it has to go our way.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.214
I'll kill that bitch.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.843
With kindness.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.806
-Three, two, one. Shoot.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.437
That is a crossbow, because I'm a hunter.
Hunter, bear, ninja?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.188
Say what?

17:04.690 --> 17:05.774
Hunter, bear, ninja?

17:06.316 --> 17:10.571
Bear eats ninja. [growls]
Ninja kills hunter. Ninja.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.407
Hunter shoots bear. Got it?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.035
No. What? A bear eat… What?

17:16.118 --> 17:17.995
Okay, fine, we'll do a different one.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.830
Um, foot, cockroach, atomic bomb.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.167
All right, three, two, one. Shoot!

17:23.250 --> 17:24.376
Yeah, I don't know that one either.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.836
Foot, cockroach, atomic bomb?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.297
Foot kills cockroach.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.133
Atomic bomb blows up foot. Cockroach…

17:33.677 --> 17:34.720
survives atomic bomb.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.888
You just made that up.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.222
No, I didn't just make that up.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.350
Let's just go old school.
Rock, paper, scissors.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.520
-Okay?
-Okay, grandma.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.194
Three, two, one.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.237
Shit.

Sweet. Spoils go to the victor.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.827
-What?
-What, what?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.705
What? What's the little
[imitates chuckling] smirk on your face?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.457
What is that? What's that shit?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.377
You're predictable.
You always throw the third choice.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.755
[laughs] I do not.

18:11.048 --> 18:16.178
Hunter, atomic bomb, scissors.
Every time, third choice.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.642
-Well played.
-Hmm.

Now let's go get your chump-change bounty.
Our cat food awaits.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.773
-[Spike] Cat food's better than no food.
-Is it?

Stoner Stu has been captured!

is having a hell of a day.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.448
I fucking hate that blockhead.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.076
Can't help but notice
that T-Bone is still in play.

18:40.119 --> 18:44.289
Oh, no, it looks like T-Bone Wilson
has just killed six,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.208
count them six, bounty hunters.

with his new therapist.

It was great.

Did you get his card?

larger than you can chew.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.589
You don't think I can do this.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.050
That's why you keep
recommending pussy bounties.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.011

of Suzie Creamcheese or something.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.723
No. Of course not.

never heard of you.

as I'm turning him in.

the Cunningham Sisters. Yeah.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.726
That's not a birthmark?

24:39.227 --> 24:43.023

Bohdan the Bison. [clicks tongue]

No family to reach out to.

So what's Udai's next move?

26:01.935 --> 26:03.395
Go to ground maybe?

26:03.979 --> 26:04.813
Nah.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.857
He's been in a 3-by-6
for the last nine years.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.953
Yeah. I'm here with Jet now.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.955
Yeah. Oh, yeah?

Cons will make you tiramisu.

-You come to the house.
-Yeah, sure.

Udai wouldn't hide in a hole,
but he'd hide in a box.

26:45.729 --> 26:49.024
Like that Captain Saturday, the dealer
who hid in his own shipping container?

26:49.107 --> 26:52.736
Exactly. The only way
Udai gets off Europa without papers

26:52.819 --> 26:55.280
is if he stows away in
an interplanetary container freighter.

26:55.363 --> 26:58.325
And where would he slip
into one of those unseen?

27:35.737 --> 27:39.074
First words out of that pretty mouth
better be an apology.

27:40.367 --> 27:43.370
You asked me for Gunther,
my best hit man, I sent him to you.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.829
No questions asked.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.582
As a show of good faith between us.

27:47.666 --> 27:51.044
But I get him back in a box.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.005
It was unfortunate.
