WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[clock ticking]

00:26.943 --> 00:32.073
A toast to my ascension
as new head of the Syndicate.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.746
You don't look happy, Julia.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.415
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.668
To be free of the Elders.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.295
[sighs in exasperation]

00:45.378 --> 00:46.755
-Vicious--
-[Vicious] Don't worry.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.215
Everything went to plan.

00:50.967 --> 00:57.057
Just not the plan
you and Mao came up with.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.099
[inhales sharply]

00:59.059 --> 01:00.894
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.689
There is nothing
in this world to believe in.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.859
Least of all people.

01:10.028 --> 01:14.074
Even the people
who are supposed to love you.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.367
I do love you. [grunts]

01:17.243 --> 01:18.244
[sobbing]

01:19.954 --> 01:24.417
I always wondered,
how many times did you fuck Fearless?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.170
[yells] How many?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.298
It was him, wasn't it?

01:30.381 --> 01:34.469
You found out Fearless is alive.
That's why you betrayed me. Isn't it?

01:38.556 --> 01:40.558
[laughing]

01:44.854 --> 01:46.397
It wasn't Fearless.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.733
It was you!

01:51.820 --> 01:52.821
[grunts]

01:53.613 --> 01:54.948
All of this time,

01:56.282 --> 01:58.535
I convinced myself
you couldn't have known.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.496
Because what kind of a man

02:02.330 --> 02:05.458
stays with a woman
who's slept with his best friend?

02:07.961 --> 02:11.464
Oh, but of course you knew.
And you stayed.

02:13.508 --> 02:18.388
Because you are no man at all.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.735
I am gonna hurt you, Julia.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.073
In ways that haven't been invented yet.

02:37.699 --> 02:43.413
Until you beg me to kill you,
and then I'm gonna hurt you some more.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.248
Though…

02:47.417 --> 02:48.668
you won't be alone.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.841
You'll have Fearless' head
to keep you company.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.225
[theme music playing]

03:09.272 --> 03:11.065
I think it's time to blow this scene

03:11.149 --> 03:13.193
Get everybody and the stuff together

03:13.276 --> 03:15.778
Okay, three, two, one, let's jam!

04:49.080 --> 04:51.291
[distorted laughter]

04:52.333 --> 04:53.751
-[laughs maniacally]
-[Spike grunts]

05:00.341 --> 05:01.634
[screams]

05:02.593 --> 05:03.428
[panting]

05:10.018 --> 05:12.061
[Jet] Spike! Spike!

05:19.944 --> 05:20.945
Spike!

05:22.655 --> 05:23.656
Where the hell are you?

05:24.699 --> 05:27.910
-Any sign of him on your end?
-[Faye sighs] I've got jack.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.289
And for the record,
this place is creepy as shit.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.417
[Jet] He's here somewhere, God damn it.
Keep looking for him.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.711
Spike!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.109
Yeah!

06:03.196 --> 06:05.031
Oh, shit.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.784
[Jet] Faye, I got something.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.329
There was a ship here. Someone took Spike.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.998
Whoever it was,
we need to find the bastards.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.667
Come on. Let's get outta here.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.490
[grunts]

06:48.366 --> 06:49.283
[groans]

06:51.202 --> 06:52.078
[moans]

06:55.248 --> 06:57.083
[breathing heavily]

06:58.626 --> 07:00.920
[jazz music playing]

07:10.138 --> 07:13.266
-Rough night?
-About the usual these days.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.519
How did I get here?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.897
-Gren brought you in.
-With pleasure.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.942
[Spike] How did you find me?

07:23.568 --> 07:26.237
Lin and Shin still come in
from time to time.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.073
I bugged Lin. A few weeks back.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.159
He always was the stupider of the two.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.786
I thought you had rules
about getting involved.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.038
I do.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.503
But you'd be dead otherwise.
And I couldn't let that happen.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.839
Again.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.595
Again?

07:53.556 --> 07:57.393
Truth is, I've been involved
since the night they tried to kill you.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.312
And this…

08:01.439 --> 08:03.649
This is not from getting old.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.915
[young Faye] You can do it, all right?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.918
Go me! Go me! Go me! Yay!

08:22.001 --> 08:24.212
[melancholic music playing]

08:58.329 --> 09:00.331
[beeping]

09:02.667 --> 09:03.501
Yes!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.173
-Jet. I think I found something.
-I found something.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.466
Oh.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.467
You first.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.221
The ship that took Spike.
A friend at Astral Gate Security,

09:15.304 --> 09:17.723
he matched the time stamp
and vessel registration.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.769
It just landed in Tharsis two hours ago,
next to a nightclub called "Ana's."

09:21.852 --> 09:22.979
What've you got?

09:23.896 --> 09:25.898
I think I might know where I grew up.

09:25.982 --> 09:26.983
Can it keep?

09:30.736 --> 09:33.656
Because I need you on this.
Spike needs you on this.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.702
Once we get him back, we can help you
track your shit down. All of it.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.955
We'll figure it out. Together.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.752
Let's go get Spike.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.838
-[woman on PA] Bebop clearing hyperspace.
-Deal.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.381
[woman on PA] Arriving gateway…

09:53.634 --> 09:54.927
Bebop cleared.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.471
They were coming after me.
You can't blame yourself.

09:58.055 --> 10:01.475
I signed your death warrant that night.
Yours and Julia's.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.394
You said Vicious put a sword
through your leg.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.521
The best of us would have broken.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.568
Hey. I'm gonna find him.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.321
And I'm gonna kill him.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.574
You putting that miserable piece of shit
in the ground for good…

10:17.325 --> 10:18.951
I'll second that motion.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.369
Find Julia first.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.663
She still loves you.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.252
Does she know?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.212
[Gren] That you're alive?

10:31.505 --> 10:32.965
She figured it out.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.259
And knowing is gonna get her killed.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.138
I'll make sure she's safe.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.393
It's a long overdue promise
I need to make good on.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.398
Then you're gonna need this.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.400
-[Jet] Don't move!
-Put the gun down.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.986
[Jet] I said drop it. Now!

10:54.654 --> 10:55.988
Same goes for you, lovelies.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.283
Hey, hey, hey. Nobody needs to be
pointing any weapons right now.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.410
Okay? Hey. Easy.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.039
They're with me. So are they.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.750
Faye, come on.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.504
Faye? Come on, put the weapon down.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.717
What the hell? We thought you were dead.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.678
Yeah, I get that a lot.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.475
Jet, come on.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.905
Hey, listen, I…

11:38.572 --> 11:39.782
[grunts]

11:39.865 --> 11:41.742
Hurt… hurting me.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.413
I'm sorry. Thought I'd lost you, partner.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.747
Yeah. [chuckles]

11:46.831 --> 11:48.416
Glad to see you're still kicking.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.252
Hey, whatever happened to
that unkillable super assassin?

11:51.335 --> 11:52.169
Um…

11:52.962 --> 11:53.921
Yeah, I killed him.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.548
Oh. Nice.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.591
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Shit. Give me a minute.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.260
It's Kimmie.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.222
Hey, bean. I can't talk right now, but…

12:04.056 --> 12:06.934
Is this an open bar, by chance?

12:07.017 --> 12:08.936
Oh, you're a fun one, aren't you?

12:09.895 --> 12:11.147
The fucking funnest.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.106
[laughs]

12:18.821 --> 12:19.864
Jet?

12:22.032 --> 12:22.867
Jet?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.746
-Who the fuck are you?
-[grunts]

12:28.789 --> 12:29.874
Jet!

12:29.957 --> 12:31.208
Oh, I thought we'd moved beyond this.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.752
-They took her.
-Who?

12:32.835 --> 12:33.836
Kimmie!

12:34.920 --> 12:37.131
Goddamn Syndicate kidnapped her
from Europa.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.217
Took her right out of school.
They want to exchange her for him.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.929
Except they didn't call him Spike.
They called you Fearless.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.140
Who are you?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.851
And why does the Syndicate want
to use my daughter to get to you, huh?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.896
The man who took Kimmie…

12:53.689 --> 12:56.692
His name is Vicious. He was my partner.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.281
Back when I killed people
for the Syndicate.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.701
-What?
-You son of a…

13:06.368 --> 13:07.912
You're a goddamn hit man?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.664
All this shit about ex-military?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.333
-I never said that.
-[Jet] You never…

13:12.416 --> 13:13.793
You let me believe it.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.755
God damn. You're a Syndicate hit man.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.509
Was. They've been trying to kill me
ever since they found out I'm still alive.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.261
I'm gonna save them the trouble
and kill you myself.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.346
You could.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.808
Yeah. You'd be right to.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.351
But you need me.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.646
To barter for Kimmie's life.

13:35.731 --> 13:36.565
[clicks]

13:36.649 --> 13:37.858
[breath trembling]

13:39.777 --> 13:41.403
You don't hand me over to Vicious,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.448
he's gonna kill her.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.042
Fine. Let's get this over with.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.462
Spike, if you should
find your way out of this…

13:58.546 --> 13:59.713
I wouldn't count on it.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.881
Julia needs you.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.842
Time to clear out.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.552
-[Jet] Let's go.
-It's not safe anymore.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.470
I'll survive.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.806
I always do.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.901
[Jet] You try and run,
it's gonna be bad for you.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.361
[Spike] I'm done running.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.488
He told you
the fish factory for the exchange, right?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.573
Yeah.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.616
-I know that place.
-I'll bet you do.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.911
Listen, we can get around the guards,
if we can manage--

14:30.995 --> 14:33.873
-[grunts]
-Jet! What are you doing?

14:34.748 --> 14:36.125
There's a better way!

14:39.461 --> 14:40.462
You can't turn him in.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.631
Don't kid yourself. This is happening.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.759
You know we can get her back
if we work together.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.137
You think I'm gonna
risk my daughter's life

14:48.220 --> 14:51.599
on the word of Spike Spiegel, or Fearless,
or whatever the hell his name is?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.893
-You can't.
-I will.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.228
I won't.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.859
You know, he might be a dick,
but he risked his life for mine.

15:01.942 --> 15:05.404
Risked his life for yours.
Many times over, I'm sure of it.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.948
He knew the rules. No lies.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.993
He could have come clean with me.
He could have walked away from me.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.037
He could have done
a million things he didn't.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.455
What did he do?

15:14.538 --> 15:16.624
He put my daughter's life
in a killer's hands.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.584
By my math, the slate is clean.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.211
It's his life for Kimmie's.
That's the play.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.923
Well, that fucked-up math doesn't add up.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.302
I won't carry that weight.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.096
[soulful music playing]

16:00.876 --> 16:04.630
[whispers] You know he's not gonna
let you live after this, right?

16:06.548 --> 16:10.636
You're the only one who knows
why Vicious really tried to kill Fearless.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.442
[song ends]

17:09.862 --> 17:11.488
Did you ever love Vicious?

17:14.783 --> 17:15.993
I thought I did.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.498
And then I realized
I didn't know what love was.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.917
Until it was too late.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.256
Until Fearless.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.555
Then you should be with him.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.224
[choking]

17:40.684 --> 17:41.852
[tires screech]

17:43.645 --> 17:44.772
[Julia screams]

18:13.675 --> 18:15.010
Evening, Officer.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.180
It's going to be okay, honey. I'm here.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.101
[breathing shakily]

18:22.184 --> 18:23.936
Everything's gonna be okay.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.522
Do you have him?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.399
He's in the trunk.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.070
He didn't exactly come willingly.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.614
Look, if he's not there,

18:36.740 --> 18:39.535
you've got enough guys here
to show me the error of my ways.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.306
Spike!

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
Now!

19:23.662 --> 19:24.663
No.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.207
Shit.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.837
See you soon, Spike.

19:55.777 --> 19:56.987
[metal creaking]

20:02.451 --> 20:03.410
[sputtering]

20:07.456 --> 20:08.749
[Julia breathing heavily]

21:13.313 --> 21:14.648

21:21.571 --> 21:22.739
[Spike] Oh, good, you're up.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.871
I was getting worried you were gonna
sleep through my execution.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.124
I wouldn't want to miss that.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.960
How long have I been out?

21:36.670 --> 21:37.796
[Spike] A couple of hours.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.964
[panting]

21:42.592 --> 21:43.635
Where are we?

21:46.555 --> 21:47.889
[Spike] Ninth ring of Hell.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.270
[groans, pants]

21:55.147 --> 21:56.148
Hey.

21:58.984 --> 21:59.901
Thank you.

22:00.902 --> 22:01.737
For what?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.907
Prolonging your lousy life
a few more miserable minutes?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.493
For changing your mind on me.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.288
[scoffs]

22:13.123 --> 22:15.459
For giving me a chance
to make right on my wrongs.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.377
Yeah, didn't work out so good.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.339
For either of us.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.008
We've seen worse.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.053
Have we?

22:26.762 --> 22:27.971
[door opens]

22:36.396 --> 22:39.483
When angels are forced out of Heaven,

22:40.442 --> 22:41.902
they become devils.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.157
You agree, don't you? Spike?

22:47.741 --> 22:50.077
Where's Kimmie?
If you hurt her, I swear before God--

22:50.160 --> 22:51.036
[Vicious] Hurt her?

22:51.119 --> 22:52.120
[laughs]

22:53.330 --> 22:54.706
I would never hurt a kid.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.834
No kids.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.462
Isn't that right?

23:02.297 --> 23:07.010
And everyone fancied you… the angel.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.639
[softly] Only when standing at your side.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.975
I'm the Devil?

23:16.353 --> 23:17.813
Stop me when I'm wrong.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.941
Spike is a liar. A betrayer.

23:21.024 --> 23:25.570
He cares only about himself
and death follows him wherever he goes.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.155
Sound like an angel to you?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.907
I just want my daughter.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.036
[Vicious breathing heavily]

23:36.832 --> 23:40.001
I gave you a space in my family's crypt.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.379
Did you know that?

23:42.462 --> 23:46.341
I used to come down here
after you betrayed me

23:46.425 --> 23:47.884
to mourn what I'd lost.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.596
To mourn you.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.393
But I found I had no tears to weep.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.442
Bring the girl.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.779
Thank you. Thank you.

24:07.863 --> 24:08.989
[Vicious laughing]

24:10.282 --> 24:11.783
Oh, how delightful.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.829
You actually think I'm letting her go?

24:15.912 --> 24:16.830
[grunts]

24:16.913 --> 24:20.375
See, Spike and I are both devils.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.919
The difference is, I'm honest about it.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.380
-You said you wouldn't hurt her.
-I won't.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.717
-I'll kill her.
-God damn, you piece of shit!

[yells]

24:30.469 --> 24:31.803
[groaning]

24:38.727 --> 24:40.937
Ever since I learned you're alive,

24:41.021 --> 24:45.358
all I could think about
was putting you in that empty hole.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.402
[Jet breathing heavily]

24:47.486 --> 24:49.196
You should have just died that night.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.656
Or you should have
killed yourself for what you did!

24:51.740 --> 24:52.824
Look at me!

24:55.285 --> 24:57.078
You were supposed to be my brother.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.749
You were supposed to love me!

25:00.832 --> 25:03.460
I was supposed to end you.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.005
I will not make that mistake again.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.134
[Kimmie crying]

25:12.135 --> 25:13.094
[Jet] Kimmie!

25:13.845 --> 25:16.097
I've got you, bean. I've got you.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.892
-I'm scared.
-I know, baby. I know.

[grunting]

25:23.647 --> 25:25.315
[yells, groans]

25:29.945 --> 25:32.822
This is where you die… for the last time.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.491
[breathing heavily]

25:36.117 --> 25:41.122
But you're gonna watch
your partner and his brat die first.

25:42.624 --> 25:46.169
Look at me. Look at me.
It's gonna be okay.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.922
[Kimmie crying] Dad, I wanna go home.

25:49.005 --> 25:52.300
Okay, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.098
It's okay, baby.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.643
It's gonna be okay, baby. Okay?

I'll be all right.

27:38.823 --> 27:39.658

I got you. I got you.

-Here you go, sweetheart.
-[Faye] Come on, kiddo.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.298
Thought you didn't like the math.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.676
You're both idiots.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.513
But I couldn't get good on you
knuckledusters dying a dipshit death.

Okay. Come on.

I'm not finished here.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.777
-What? Are you stupid?
-Let him go.

Get them outta here.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.581
Shoot them before they shoot you, huh?

You should see yourself.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.201
Do you have any idea what you look like
right at this moment, Spike?

32:33.701 --> 32:34.535
What?

32:34.619 --> 32:35.995
A ravenous beast.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.707
The same blood runs through both of us.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.836
The blood of a beast who wanders,
hunting for the blood of others.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.047
I've bled all that kind of blood away.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.548

It's true.

Are you okay?

33:45.481 --> 33:46.607
I am now.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.778
I've dreamt of you.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.739
Have you?

33:55.116 --> 33:56.117
Endlessly.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.080
Then why didn't you come for me?

34:05.376 --> 34:07.837
All these years, you…
you knew where I was.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.924
Yet you let me languish with him.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.178
Why?

34:15.261 --> 34:17.055
[Vicious laughs, groans]

34:17.722 --> 34:21.559
Because I told him you chose me.

34:21.642 --> 34:22.643
[laughs]

34:24.687 --> 34:26.272
And you believed him?

34:28.107 --> 34:29.108
I shouldn't have.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.320
I'm sorry.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.530
But now we can make it right.

34:35.323 --> 34:37.533
We can be free of all of this.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.202
Of him. The Syndicate, we can--

34:39.285 --> 34:40.703
[Julia] Why would I want to be free of it?

Right at the moment
when I've captured the throne.

of controlling the Syndicate is him.

And the rule will be ours.

No.

That life, I told you…

I don't want it anymore.

What about what I want?

35:31.003 --> 35:32.380
This isn't you.

You made me who I am.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.467
No. No, Julia--

Leaving me with him to fend for myself.

I never stopped loving you.

That may be.

But it's clear now.
