01:02.462 --> 01:05.495
Last night,
I dreamt of a steady,

01:05.498 --> 01:08.401
cool rain falling out
of the African sky,

01:09.436 --> 01:11.701
soaking me to my bones.

01:14.740 --> 01:18.208
I watched as my filth
pooled at my feet,

01:18.210 --> 01:21.180
the raindrops washing
away my stories.

01:22.748 --> 01:23.816
That I was free.

01:29.188 --> 01:34.193
But then I awoke, choking on
the dust of this dry place.

01:36.328 --> 01:38.529
And I wondered if
hope does exist

01:38.531 --> 01:40.198
for people who are desperate

01:40.200 --> 01:42.201
and have nothing
else to cling to.

01:44.837 --> 01:46.105
I have to know.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.542
Because if hope is stupid,

01:52.879 --> 01:54.514
why would anything matter?

02:02.287 --> 02:04.689
Balls, it is so
effin' hot out here.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.823
Yeah?

02:05.825 --> 02:07.859
Hell of an experience though.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.128
Feels so good to be
making a difference.

02:15.835 --> 02:16.703
Oh.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.374
Shit, I had the total runs for
the first two days straight.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.244
I seriously thought I was
gonna perish out here.

02:26.612 --> 02:27.644
My parents wanted me
to fly back early,

02:27.646 --> 02:30.382
but I was like WWJD?

02:33.453 --> 02:34.319
Oh, whoa!

02:35.722 --> 02:37.321
That feels right.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.655
You've been here longer
than I have though.

02:38.657 --> 02:40.393
Bet you can't wait to get home?

02:41.760 --> 02:44.229
Do you have any
Jamba Juice, dude?

02:45.298 --> 02:46.366
Come, come.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.233
Come here.

02:49.235 --> 02:50.901
You need to move it.

02:50.903 --> 02:52.570
Twist it tight.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.204
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

02:54.206 --> 02:57.543
College boy,
we have to work, please.

03:04.283 --> 03:05.816
That sign, you can mix it.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.620
All right, all right.

03:45.824 --> 03:48.560
That is the fourth
child that she will bury.

03:50.295 --> 03:52.596
This droughts,
they devastate us.

03:52.598 --> 03:54.698
This one seems
longer than the last.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.703
We pray to God to help but,

03:59.004 --> 03:59.871
He's silent.

04:55.627 --> 04:56.495
Sorry.

04:58.697 --> 05:00.764
Where the hell is he?

05:00.766 --> 05:02.466
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.901
Hey, what's up Kelley?

05:03.903 --> 05:05.603
I'm looking for
your idiot roommate.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.003
Why? Did you guys
break up again?

05:07.005 --> 05:07.873
No, why?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.384
Are you Stu's roommate?

05:28.394 --> 05:29.461
Yo, broski.

05:30.529 --> 05:32.529
Is it the 14th already, man?

05:32.531 --> 05:34.531
I was gonna have this place
all spiffed and shined for ya.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.401
Come here.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.469
Oh yeah, man.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.471
I am totally getting
the bad ass vibe

05:40.473 --> 05:42.707
off you with the
beard and the tan.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.108
How was Somalia?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.608
Kenya.

05:45.610 --> 05:46.776
Kenya, right.

05:46.778 --> 05:48.646
Hey, you need to come join us.

05:48.648 --> 05:52.550
Lots of inebriated females
making bad decisions.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.483
Let's party.

05:53.485 --> 05:54.452
Let's party.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.586
I would but-

05:55.588 --> 05:58.124
- All right, see you out there.

06:10.970 --> 06:11.836
Oh, shit.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.704
Look who's here.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.841
Hey, welcome back.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.509
- How are you?
- I can't believe it.

06:25.016 --> 06:26.552
How was Africa?

06:40.932 --> 06:42.500
I'll talk to you in a minute.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.668
We've got some really
good news today.

06:52.778 --> 06:54.512
Working along with
many other organizations

06:54.514 --> 06:56.947
to raise money for relief help,

06:56.949 --> 06:58.949
and to build wells
in communities

06:58.951 --> 07:00.753
with no access to clean water.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.464
No, no, no, no. Just hold.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.865
What are you doing? Stop.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.534
Okay. What, what lens are...

07:16.536 --> 07:18.902
You're using a 50 millimeter.

07:18.904 --> 07:20.738
You've got like the
bridge of the Queen Mary,

07:20.740 --> 07:22.606
between you and her.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.041
You know what? We're gonna
Photoshop a little baby there.

07:24.043 --> 07:27.010
What an adorable, next
Fredericks of Hollywood.

07:27.012 --> 07:28.745
I think that if
I would, maybe..

07:28.747 --> 07:30.113
I'll just try a couple.

07:30.115 --> 07:31.748
I'll just try a couple on my own

07:31.750 --> 07:33.117
and we'll see how,
if it turns out

07:33.119 --> 07:34.551
and then we can go from there.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.656
No, her neck is fine.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.156
It's gonna look
good in the lens.

07:40.158 --> 07:43.726
You're seeing in
3D with two eyes,

07:43.728 --> 07:45.031
the lens sees with 1D.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.033
I want you to learn this.

07:49.035 --> 07:52.469
Watch, watch with your
two-dimensional eyes.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.603
I see.

07:53.605 --> 07:54.605
And learn. Freeze don't...

07:54.607 --> 07:56.173
No, no, no, no, no.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.541
That, if she moves half an inch

07:58.543 --> 08:00.913
is gonna shatter
the beauty of the...

08:07.119 --> 08:07.987
It's better.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.861
Seriously, could my
day get any crappier?

08:50.863 --> 08:51.731
Okay, bye.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.733
I loved painting that one.

08:56.735 --> 08:57.903
It's beautiful.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.072
What's it about?

09:01.139 --> 09:02.641
That beauty surrounds us.

09:06.144 --> 09:07.112
How much is it?

09:13.085 --> 09:13.953
You any good?

09:14.986 --> 09:16.587
Oh.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.256
Nah.

09:18.823 --> 09:20.190
My dad volunteers
teaching an art class

09:20.192 --> 09:21.658
at a homeless shelter.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.728
He's obsessed with photography.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.233
So why was your day so bad?

09:30.235 --> 09:31.102
What?

09:31.971 --> 09:33.603
Oh yeah.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.672
I have a flat tire and
I don't have a car jack

09:35.674 --> 09:37.676
and just some
other stupid stuff.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.846
I don't wanna bore you with my
life's insignificant details.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.214
But it's your life.

09:45.216 --> 09:47.084
How could the details
be insignificant?

09:52.958 --> 09:53.825
Thanks.

10:09.674 --> 10:11.610
I have a car jack you could use.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.648
I can't believe
I don't even have a spare.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.849
I think I have one
in my car that'll fit.

10:19.851 --> 10:22.752
No, no, no, I don't
wanna take your tire.

10:22.754 --> 10:24.189
It's okay. I'll be right back

10:30.096 --> 10:32.061
You
from around here?

10:32.063 --> 10:33.397
Yep. You?

10:33.399 --> 10:35.331
Yep.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.202
I graduate from the U this
spring with an art degree.

10:38.236 --> 10:39.169
Oh.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.972
Everything okay?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.406
Yeah.

10:43.408 --> 10:46.276
So what do you wanna
do after you graduate?

10:46.278 --> 10:47.379
I don't know.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.280
Teach, I guess.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.150
You guess?

10:53.019 --> 10:54.419
I wanna teach, just...

11:07.066 --> 11:08.934
- Vanessa.
- It's nothing. I'm sorry.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.435
I had a meeting with
my advisor yesterday.

11:12.437 --> 11:15.204
He completely tore my
senior project to shreds.

11:15.206 --> 11:18.342
He said that it
lacked distinction

11:18.344 --> 11:21.681
or originality or whatever.

11:23.048 --> 11:24.681
I always wanted
to have, you know,

11:24.683 --> 11:25.949
like an art gallery
or something some day.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.952
Nothing big or fancy, I just...

11:29.955 --> 11:31.754
I feel really stupid right now.

11:31.756 --> 11:33.158
I don't know why I'm
telling you this. I'm sorry.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.063
Just paint whatever
pulls you out of bed

11:39.065 --> 11:40.199
in the middle of the night,

11:41.866 --> 11:44.302
and people will stand
in line to see that.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.431
And then kind of,.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.900
Just wait.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.770
Move over.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.071
Watch this, watch this.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.440
Dutch angle candid.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.242
Just slightly over.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.343
Yes.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.945
- Perfect.
- That's good.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.012
- Do you see that?
- That's good.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.448
That's the magic.

12:45.397 --> 12:49.199
I just don't know.
They're all so good.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.136
Yes, Steve did a great job.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.936
You're very photogenic.

12:53.938 --> 12:56.873
You are so sweet.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.108
And who knew I
could look 25 again?

12:59.979 --> 13:01.878
Hey, Eric.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.016
Some chick holding a tire
is out front asking for you.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.892
So, what do you think?

13:13.826 --> 13:15.526
I'm thinking...

13:15.528 --> 13:16.560
I'm thinking you should
get a 24 by 36 of that.

13:16.562 --> 13:17.895
Of this one.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.329
I think we should do 36 wallets.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.565
What do you think
about that one?

13:21.567 --> 13:23.032
Genius.

13:25.571 --> 13:26.437
Hey.

13:29.174 --> 13:32.142
I never got your number.
I gave you mine but...

13:32.144 --> 13:34.011
And I couldn't remember
where you worked.

13:34.013 --> 13:37.046
So I checked every store
with a photo studio attached

13:37.048 --> 13:38.515
like a stalker,

13:38.517 --> 13:40.917
but I promised you that
I'd get your tire back.

13:40.919 --> 13:41.586
So here it is.

13:45.557 --> 13:48.124
Some of these photos
are really something.

13:48.126 --> 13:52.128
Yeah, those were
mostly taken by Steve.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.296
My boss.

13:53.298 --> 13:54.998
I love that one.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.868
Oh yeah.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.002
That kid did not wanna be here.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.438
Took about an hour
to calm him down.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.942
You must be very patient.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.447
Hey, I was gonna...

14:13.586 --> 14:15.484
And I was
at a complete loss.

14:15.486 --> 14:17.387
Oh, dude. I'm so
glad you're still here.

14:17.389 --> 14:18.988
Stu, what are you doing here?

14:18.990 --> 14:20.456
I dropped by
the old port stude

14:20.458 --> 14:22.092
to see if you wanted
to grab some dinner,

14:22.094 --> 14:24.026
but I overheard
you making plans.

14:24.028 --> 14:25.929
And it's a good thing that I
was eavesdropping this time

14:25.931 --> 14:27.129
because I locked myself
out of the apartment again.

14:27.131 --> 14:30.066
And you turned off your phone.

14:30.068 --> 14:31.468
- Hey.
- Hey

14:31.470 --> 14:32.636
Vanessa. This is my-

14:32.638 --> 14:34.240
- Stuart Halcombe.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.940
I'm Eric's closest confidante.

14:37.942 --> 14:39.877
Just don't lock
me out this time.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.277
Absolutely, dude.

14:41.279 --> 14:42.546
- All right. Cool.
- Nice to see you, Stu.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.180
Bye.

14:44.182 --> 14:45.348
He's...

14:45.350 --> 14:47.917
What is that?

14:47.919 --> 14:50.320
Hey, Vanessa. How're you doing?

14:50.322 --> 14:53.589
So has Eric been telling
you about all the marathons

14:53.591 --> 14:55.224
that he runs to raise money

14:55.226 --> 14:56.660
for his charity
work in Ethiopia?

14:56.662 --> 14:58.462
Hey, can we get some
more chips and salsa?

14:58.464 --> 15:00.329
- You've been to Africa?
- Well, yeah.

15:00.331 --> 15:02.232
- I mean, a little bit.
- Oh yeah. He's so modest.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.367
You should totally get him
to show you the pictures

15:03.369 --> 15:07.070
of him holding the sick babies.

15:07.072 --> 15:07.940
It's just...

15:14.046 --> 15:17.915
All right, so you know,
I've gotta go somewhere.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.951
You need that back?

15:20.318 --> 15:21.651
Okay, bye.

15:21.653 --> 15:23.954
How long have you known him?

15:23.956 --> 15:26.024
I met him two years
ago at a laundromat.

15:28.192 --> 15:29.325
Oh my God.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.031
I love the rain.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.232
Well, that's fortunate.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.168
You ready to run?

15:37.068 --> 15:38.200
You first.

15:38.202 --> 15:39.268
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.123
Take my jacket.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.160
It's wet. It's all wet.

16:15.139 --> 16:16.008
Come on.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.110
What are you...

16:25.250 --> 16:26.384
Go in there.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.089
Greetings, my dear child.

16:33.091 --> 16:35.461
How long has it been since
your last confession?

16:36.761 --> 16:38.663
So tell me about your mother.

16:39.597 --> 16:41.198
Why?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.368
I'm just kidding.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.167
Oh.

16:45.169 --> 16:46.169
Besides I
don't think priests ask

16:46.171 --> 16:47.337
about that anyway.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.440
Right, shrinks do.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.143
Okay.

16:54.145 --> 16:56.381
Let's ask each other deep and
invasive personal questions.

16:57.482 --> 16:59.248
Why would we do that?

16:59.250 --> 17:00.586
Because it's fun.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.222
Tell me your biggest regret.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.060
Okay. The biggest regret.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.632
Do you routinely corner
people in confessional booths

17:15.634 --> 17:17.601
to ask them personal questions?

17:17.603 --> 17:19.268
No.

17:19.270 --> 17:22.104
But since we are in one,
it seems fitting, right?

17:22.106 --> 17:24.608
How about, have you
ever been in love?

17:28.180 --> 17:30.080
No, not in the
way that you mean.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.248
Which way is that?

17:31.250 --> 17:32.116
The real way.

17:34.185 --> 17:37.787
Okay, who is the most
influential person in your life?

17:37.789 --> 17:39.555
Definitely my parents.

17:39.557 --> 17:41.091
It's a tie.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.294
Are you close with yours?

17:44.395 --> 17:46.430
I never really knew my dad.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.565
Why not?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.066
He left before I was born.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.367
Isn't that two questions?

17:51.369 --> 17:52.303
And your mom?

17:56.508 --> 17:58.110
She's not around anymore.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.478
Did she die?

18:03.147 --> 18:03.815
Yeah.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.153
Oh Eric, I'm so sorry.

18:09.454 --> 18:13.155
Holy shit.

18:13.157 --> 18:15.659
I thought I was
gonna pee my pants.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.693
How did he not see you?

18:17.695 --> 18:19.328
I don't know.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.463
When he started
praying with you,

18:20.465 --> 18:22.298
I hightailed it out of there.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.601
And just ran as fast as I can.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.244
Oh, yeah.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.680
Since when do you iron?

18:37.682 --> 18:39.382
I got a fellowship
interview today.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.384
So, what's the deal with her?

18:42.386 --> 18:43.385
What?

18:43.387 --> 18:45.287
Oh, come on, man.

18:45.289 --> 18:46.722
You've been like a monk
for the last three years.

18:46.724 --> 18:48.557
The least you can
do is rollick me

18:48.559 --> 18:51.527
with a few self-indulgent
superficial details.

18:51.529 --> 18:52.396
I don't know.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.132
She invited me to her
parents' place Thursday

18:55.134 --> 18:55.800
for Thanksgiving.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.503
Let me get this straight.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.238
On your first date,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.206
she wants to spend
like 14 hours with you.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.208
Then she invites you
to her folks' house

19:05.210 --> 19:06.377
for a major holiday?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.312
And all this time,

19:09.314 --> 19:11.180
I thought you needed
remedial help with women.

19:11.182 --> 19:12.615
So are you going?

19:12.617 --> 19:14.250
Nah, I got too
much stuff to do.

19:14.252 --> 19:15.785
Come to Chicago with me.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.720
You know my mom likes
you better anyway.

19:17.722 --> 19:19.322
I'll be back by Friday night.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.624
I can't. I gotta work
Friday at 5:00 a.m.

19:21.626 --> 19:22.926
Pictures with Santa, remember?

19:22.928 --> 19:24.594
Yay.

19:24.596 --> 19:25.564
Have fun with that.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.731
And my goal in
running this marathon

19:28.733 --> 19:31.601
is to raise money for
one, maybe even two wells.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.803
Huge tax deduction
for your organization.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.404
Okay, sure. No.

19:35.406 --> 19:36.773
Even a small amount
would be great.

19:36.775 --> 19:37.707
Hey, nice job.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.710
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.712
Hi Vanessa. This is...

20:16.949 --> 20:18.847
I am.

20:18.849 --> 20:20.718
Yeah, thanks. It must've
been like a 24-hour thing.

20:22.887 --> 20:26.623
I really appreciated dinner.

20:26.625 --> 20:30.259
It was really kind of you.

20:30.261 --> 20:31.762
So thanks.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.968
Oh

20:41.339 --> 20:42.905
Yes.

20:42.907 --> 20:43.875
- Okay.
- Awesome.

20:44.809 --> 20:46.375
Let's try another one.

20:46.377 --> 20:47.443
Brian, look alive.

20:47.445 --> 20:48.911
Oh, right.

20:48.913 --> 20:50.247
Three, two...

20:50.249 --> 20:51.450
Intelligent, look intelligent.

20:54.486 --> 20:55.619
Great.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.420
Brian, tilt and Tricia tilt.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.622
And three, two, One.

20:58.624 --> 20:59.490
Perfect.

21:00.558 --> 21:02.324
Try to think of some thoughts.

21:02.326 --> 21:04.663
Just take one more.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.802
Edward Whitney.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.504
What are you doing?

21:14.506 --> 21:15.939
You said he's a
philosophy professor

21:15.941 --> 21:17.841
at my place of education.

21:17.843 --> 21:18.975
He wrote a book called

21:18.977 --> 21:21.344
"Finding Jesus in the Dark Room:

21:21.346 --> 21:23.347
Snapshots of Faith and Doubt".

21:24.915 --> 21:26.815
Why would you take a
leak off the Berlin wall?

21:26.817 --> 21:29.318
Well, my sergeant and I
actually just wanted pictures

21:29.320 --> 21:30.687
of us standing on the wall.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.389
I still don't know why we peed.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.757
The good news is that our names

21:33.759 --> 21:35.292
weren't on the
ambassador's apology

21:35.294 --> 21:36.660
to the East German people.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.064
So you teach philosophy?

21:43.999 --> 21:45.468
Don't miss the donut by
looking through the hole.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.571
A thousand men cannot
undress one naked man.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.639
Sorry.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.543
Yes, I teach philosophy.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.378
Vanessa says that you
are a photographer?

21:55.380 --> 21:56.813
Yes, sir.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.914
Just most family
portraits, mostly.

21:58.916 --> 22:00.784
Just?

22:00.786 --> 22:02.852
My family portraits are the
most mysterious and fascinating.

22:02.854 --> 22:05.721
Just think if those
photos could speak up.

22:05.723 --> 22:06.724
Yeah, that's true.

22:08.026 --> 22:08.994
Are you Lutheran?

22:10.028 --> 22:11.661
Lutheran...

22:11.663 --> 22:14.698
Were you at least
baptized as an infant,

22:14.700 --> 22:16.333
or were you dipped?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.834
Mama, could you come
with me in the kitchen?

22:18.836 --> 22:22.338
I was just getting to know
Vanessa's new little friend.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.341
My grandma has been
trying to set me up

22:24.343 --> 22:26.976
with her church organist
for like three years.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.611
And?

22:28.613 --> 22:30.846
Well, he's 40
and really creepy.

22:30.848 --> 22:33.382
Hey, but at least
he's a Lutheran.

22:33.384 --> 22:34.385
Yeah, that's true.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.357
Whatever.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.759
That is JP, my
parents' foster kid,

22:43.761 --> 22:45.496
and he is such a jerk.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.797
Says a lot about your parents.

22:48.799 --> 22:51.668
Yeah. Well my dad, his
mom died when he was 15.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.772
He was basically
alone from then on.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.641
You're putting too
much on the plate.

22:58.643 --> 23:00.709
You're doing a great job.

23:00.711 --> 23:02.010
- They'll fall off.
- Mama, come on.

23:02.012 --> 23:06.048
- Come on, mama.
- Oh, grandma, grandma.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.851
Put this right there.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.486
You do such a good
job with that.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.388
Eric, darling, can you
take the punch bowl

23:11.390 --> 23:12.855
and put it on the table and
then come back in and finish?

23:12.857 --> 23:14.524
You're doing a great job.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.426
Mom, oh my God.
These are so cute.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.559
You made every single one

23:17.561 --> 23:18.663
and you made the walnut ones?

23:20.565 --> 23:22.067
- I'm so sorry.
- There you go.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.469
You know what? I
think you missed a spot.

23:26.471 --> 23:27.970
Shut up.

23:27.972 --> 23:29.538
Here, I grabbed one
of my dad's shirts.

23:29.540 --> 23:30.873
You wanna give me
yours and I'll wash it?

23:30.875 --> 23:32.741
No, thanks. It'll dry.

23:32.743 --> 23:34.677
You're covered in punch
and it's gonna stain.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.078
It's just an old shirt.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.713
Eric, just change
your damn shirt.

23:37.715 --> 23:39.850
I don't need to,
so just drop it.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.126
Quieter out here, isn't it?

23:51.128 --> 23:53.062
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:53.064 --> 23:54.197
I didn't mean to scare you.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.132
No, I just got this new camera

23:56.134 --> 23:58.470
and I was experimenting
with the low light.

23:59.904 --> 24:00.771
Nice.

24:01.772 --> 24:03.172
Hey, come here.

24:03.174 --> 24:05.107
Let me show you something.

24:05.109 --> 24:10.115
Come on.

24:19.590 --> 24:20.590
Voila!

24:20.592 --> 24:22.191
Wow. This is great.

24:22.193 --> 24:24.494
Ed, I
need you for a sec.

24:24.496 --> 24:25.929
Oh yeah, Bonnie. Be right up.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.030
Here, make yourself at home.

24:28.032 --> 24:28.899
Okay.

24:42.513 --> 24:43.979
Where's Ed?

24:43.981 --> 24:46.149
I think he'll be
back in a minute.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.519
I'm Eric, Vanessa's friend.

24:57.828 --> 24:58.696
No.

25:00.164 --> 25:01.965
So, are you into art too?

25:01.967 --> 25:04.566
I think it's
exceedingly lame actually.

25:04.568 --> 25:06.070
Except for photography, right?

25:08.205 --> 25:10.773
Here, let me show you
something pretty cool.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.711
This was a couple of weeks ago.

25:17.214 --> 25:18.082
JP.

25:19.884 --> 25:22.151
What have I told you
about smoking in here?

25:22.153 --> 25:23.688
We'll talk about this later.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.792
Sorry about that.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.661
JP's been a tough nut to crack,

25:31.663 --> 25:34.530
and today he disrespected
Bonnie and I snapped.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.533
I said some things to him I
probably shouldn't have said

25:36.535 --> 25:39.768
knowing his history,
and tried to apologize,

25:39.770 --> 25:41.938
but I don't really
think it was enough.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.940
Oh, it's enough.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.174
He's probably more
impressed with you now.

25:46.176 --> 25:47.776
Why is that?

25:47.778 --> 25:50.013
Because you made a
mistake and apologized.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.680
Sometimes that's even better

25:51.682 --> 25:53.183
than never making
a mistake at all.

25:59.257 --> 26:02.824
Got my first camera when
I was stationed in Korea.

26:02.826 --> 26:04.095
I just couldn't put it down.

26:05.864 --> 26:06.996
These are great.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.631
I do love art because I think

26:08.633 --> 26:10.333
it's one of the
few things in life

26:10.335 --> 26:13.201
that you really don't have
to understand to create.

26:13.203 --> 26:15.337
I mean, you can
have contradictions

26:15.339 --> 26:17.741
and doubts, insecurities.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.177
Vanna showed me some
of your photographs.

26:21.179 --> 26:22.245
They're exquisite.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.215
You have quite a talent.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.815
Thanks.

26:26.817 --> 26:28.817
Stu says you're
saving for college.

26:28.819 --> 26:31.254
You know, the US National Press

26:31.256 --> 26:34.692
has a scholarship
contest for photography.

26:36.327 --> 26:38.797
You should really consider
entering one of your photos.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.931
No, I'm serious.

26:42.933 --> 26:43.801
You should.

27:31.415 --> 27:33.315
I see the sun
struggling for attention

27:33.317 --> 27:34.985
through the trembling branches.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.856
And the cold wind whispers
our approaching fate.

27:40.290 --> 27:42.424
I've pushed the
envelope of propriety

27:42.426 --> 27:44.895
standing so close to her canvas.

27:46.263 --> 27:48.930
I'm captivated by
her colorful layers,

27:48.932 --> 27:52.701
her deep strokes are miniature
mountains reaching out to me,

27:52.703 --> 27:55.373
making valleys shadow
in the cool lights.

27:58.308 --> 28:01.411
But I'm a shadow too,
sewn to her feet,

28:01.413 --> 28:03.114
with her as she walks.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.784
And she talks to
me as if I'm real.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.419
Are you warm enough?

28:09.421 --> 28:10.452
- Yes.
- You're sure.

28:10.454 --> 28:11.787
Yes.

28:11.789 --> 28:13.221
But it's really cold up here.

28:13.223 --> 28:14.425
I just don't want
you to get sick.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.197
But my awkwardness protects me.

28:25.336 --> 28:27.003
And like her shadow,

28:27.005 --> 28:30.141
I fade and wish the
sun would never set.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.280
But if I confessed,

28:38.282 --> 28:40.951
there'd be no reason
to wait for a reply,

28:42.319 --> 28:45.123
knowing full well
this thing will die.

29:02.507 --> 29:03.472
Hey dude.

29:03.474 --> 29:04.341
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.176
I'm done.

29:07.178 --> 29:08.844
You've written four sentences.

29:08.846 --> 29:10.113
That was hard.

29:10.115 --> 29:10.981
I need candy.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.486
Hey, you know, most guys

29:16.488 --> 29:18.353
that are trying to
avoid a relationship

29:18.355 --> 29:19.354
just ignore the chick.

29:19.356 --> 29:21.324
You know, stop calling.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.325
They don't run off to
a third world country.

29:23.327 --> 29:25.327
It is a bit drastic.

29:25.329 --> 29:26.929
It's not what I'm doing.

29:26.931 --> 29:27.930
And you need to stop
reading my mail.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.231
I thought it was mine.

29:29.233 --> 29:31.033
From Africa Water Venture?

29:31.035 --> 29:33.068
I care about
Africa too, you know?

29:33.070 --> 29:34.237
Shut up.

29:34.239 --> 29:35.105
What?

29:37.509 --> 29:38.910
So you leaving again?

29:53.525 --> 29:58.496
You okay?

30:12.277 --> 30:15.246
Do you actually
think these look good?

30:17.949 --> 30:19.915
What is the matter with you?

30:19.917 --> 30:23.385
I took a chance on you when
you didn't even have an address

30:23.387 --> 30:26.189
or a phone number to
put on an application.

30:26.191 --> 30:27.959
And I have been good to you.

30:29.827 --> 30:32.995
I gave you some amazingly
fashionable work clothes.

30:32.997 --> 30:36.565
I gave you 32 bucks
of my own money

30:36.567 --> 30:38.301
to sponsor you in that marathon

30:38.303 --> 30:40.536
for your little Africa thing.

30:40.538 --> 30:41.405
And why?

30:44.209 --> 30:45.076
Why Eric?

30:46.944 --> 30:47.611
Don't speak.

30:49.446 --> 30:52.480
Because you were one of the
best damned photographers

30:52.482 --> 30:54.517
I had ever seen.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.151
But lately, you are late.

30:56.153 --> 30:58.854
Your work has been
subpar at best.

30:58.856 --> 31:00.021
I mean, where is the art?

31:00.023 --> 31:01.324
Where is the craft?

31:01.326 --> 31:02.892
Steve, are you serious?

31:02.894 --> 31:04.594
You take pictures in a mall.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.362
Of people sitting in
front of fake backdrops

31:06.364 --> 31:08.029
like the grand Canyon,

31:08.031 --> 31:10.632
that we then Photoshop
the hell out of.

31:10.634 --> 31:13.436
What did you say?

31:13.438 --> 31:14.305
I'm sorry.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.274
I'll redo the session
on my own time.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.143
I'm sorry.

31:26.183 --> 31:27.050
I'm sorry, kid.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.385
You're fired.

31:30.387 --> 31:32.020
What?

31:32.022 --> 31:32.889
Yeah.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.259
F-R-I-E-D.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.151
There's a problem
with the well we built.

32:03.153 --> 32:05.153
It's contaminated.

32:05.155 --> 32:07.055
They had to shut it down.

32:07.057 --> 32:08.457
What?

32:08.459 --> 32:10.359
They can't do
that. They need it.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.361
It's contaminated by
some form of arsenic.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.162
That's impossible.
We tested it.

32:14.164 --> 32:16.632
Yeah, but Eric, contaminants
can migrate for miles.

32:16.634 --> 32:17.967
We need to fix it.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.604
There's no money to fix it.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.472
Donations are down.

32:24.308 --> 32:25.975
I can hardly even pay the
lease to keep our door open.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.046
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

32:31.982 --> 32:35.217
They're depriving communities
of clean water because donors,

32:35.219 --> 32:37.219
governments and
nongovernmental organizations

32:37.221 --> 32:39.087
have built infrastructure

32:39.089 --> 32:40.724
and then just ignored the
need to maintain them.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.997
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

32:48.665 --> 32:50.134
Okay. All right.

32:51.501 --> 32:52.971
Yeah, thank you.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.173
I'm sorry.

33:12.222 --> 33:13.090
Eric.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.193
Eric.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.228
Hey, buddy.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.398
I'm back from Chicago.

33:24.134 --> 33:25.236
How'd the marathon go?

33:26.503 --> 33:29.171
Dude, you look like hell.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.375
- Are you sick?
- What?

33:34.378 --> 33:37.313
Hey, aren't you
going with Vanessa

33:37.315 --> 33:38.583
to an art party tonight?

33:40.351 --> 33:41.584
And you are a little musty.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.520
You might wanna shower it up.

34:02.773 --> 34:04.574
You look beautiful.

34:05.509 --> 34:07.709
Where have you been?

34:07.711 --> 34:09.710
I'm sorry I'm late.

34:09.713 --> 34:11.713
I've been calling
you for days.

34:11.715 --> 34:13.681
I misplaced my phone.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.382
And I came by, are you okay?

34:15.385 --> 34:17.385
- You don't look good.
- I'm fine.

34:17.387 --> 34:19.389
Sorry I didn't call you.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.496
I'll be right back.

35:57.755 --> 35:58.623
Hey...

36:05.596 --> 36:06.597
What are you doing?

36:09.599 --> 36:10.865
You smoke?

36:10.867 --> 36:11.735
No.

36:12.802 --> 36:13.735
Then why are you smoking?

36:13.737 --> 36:14.869
I don't smoke.

36:14.871 --> 36:16.572
It was just one cigarette.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.309
Okay Eric, what's going on?

36:21.244 --> 36:22.744
I'm leaving.

36:22.746 --> 36:24.579
Okay. Well, wait
I'll go with you.

36:24.581 --> 36:25.449
No, Vanessa.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.318
I'm going back to
Kenya, I leave Monday.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.188
What?

36:32.289 --> 36:33.356
When will you be back?

36:34.891 --> 36:36.726
I'm not coming back.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.394
You're kidding, right?

36:39.396 --> 36:41.329
I always said
I was going back.

36:41.331 --> 36:42.597
Yeah, for like a little
mission trip or something.

36:42.599 --> 36:44.233
Not to go there indefinitely.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.702
And what, you're
going in two days?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.639
- Where's the fire?
- It hasn't rained.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.340
There's no water.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.275
The villages are waste
and full of disease-

36:53.277 --> 36:54.709
- So I'm a horrible person
for not wanting you to go?

36:54.711 --> 36:56.746
'cause I thought
that you and I...

36:59.282 --> 37:00.749
So what? This it, huh?

37:00.751 --> 37:02.351
I'm just gonna get like
a Christmas form letter

37:02.353 --> 37:03.251
from you once a
year, and that's it?

37:03.253 --> 37:04.286
Vanessa...

37:04.288 --> 37:05.954
No.

37:05.956 --> 37:07.590
Have I been huffing spray
paint this entire time

37:07.592 --> 37:08.757
or have you almost
been pretending

37:08.759 --> 37:10.358
like there's not something

37:10.360 --> 37:13.830
not going on between
us, on purpose?

37:18.369 --> 37:22.271
Just because I'm leaving
doesn't mean that I don't...

37:22.273 --> 37:23.271
This isn't easy.

37:23.273 --> 37:24.706
What it isn't easy?

37:24.708 --> 37:25.609
Tell me the truth.

37:33.684 --> 37:35.553
It never would've
worked between us.

38:33.443 --> 38:35.846
What if we're longing
for day to break

38:37.581 --> 38:40.617
but night has already
strangled the dawn in her bed?

38:43.086 --> 38:46.389
What if hope is just a
tale we tell ourselves

38:47.791 --> 38:49.626
and there's nothing
else to hold on to?

38:52.530 --> 38:54.765
I came to this place
to feel normal,

38:56.634 --> 38:59.637
but someone is still
pressing me down on my back.

39:02.639 --> 39:04.442
My mind is throbbing,

39:05.809 --> 39:07.110
my hands weakening,

39:09.512 --> 39:11.614
and my pictures
are slipping away.

39:42.545 --> 39:44.445
Hey, Eric.

39:44.447 --> 39:47.148
You know I'm surprised to
see you sleeping on the job.

39:47.150 --> 39:48.818
Eric, are you okay?

39:49.753 --> 39:51.820
Eric, are you okay?

39:51.822 --> 39:52.688
Come, can you get up?

39:52.690 --> 39:53.824
Yeah.

39:56.159 --> 39:58.092
Okay, just lie back.

39:59.697 --> 40:00.829
I can't
move. I can't move.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.463
Okay Eric, don't worry.

40:02.465 --> 40:03.898
We're going to get
you to a doctor.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.833
It's okay. We're going
to get you to a doctor.

40:17.947 --> 40:19.182
How are you feeling?

40:20.684 --> 40:21.552
Better.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.653
Thank you.

40:26.891 --> 40:29.992
Eric, arrangements
have been made for you

40:29.994 --> 40:32.661
to be sent home.

40:32.663 --> 40:33.664
No, no, no.

40:34.898 --> 40:35.833
I'll be fine here.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.635
Look, I will be very
sorry to see you go,

40:39.637 --> 40:42.003
but our doctor is very concerned

40:42.005 --> 40:43.871
at how weak you still are.

40:43.873 --> 40:46.175
American hospitals can help
you much more than we can here.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.675
No, no, Matua.

40:47.677 --> 40:48.545
Please.

40:50.447 --> 40:51.114
I need to stay.

40:53.617 --> 40:58.622
I'm begging you.

41:14.103 --> 41:16.804
You clicked like,
and then all of a sudden,

41:16.806 --> 41:18.740
you was talking about
some matters of the heart

41:18.742 --> 41:20.175
on his status.

41:20.177 --> 41:21.876
What, you aren't fucking
lying to me right now.

41:21.878 --> 41:23.144
No, this bitch.

41:23.146 --> 41:25.682
She's got too much respect...

41:42.833 --> 41:44.034
I don't understand.

41:46.637 --> 41:49.003
Basically, your
immune system thinks

41:49.005 --> 41:52.076
your spinal cord has an
infection, even though it doesn't.

41:53.510 --> 41:55.177
So it's making antibodies

41:55.179 --> 41:58.112
that are attacking the myelin
cells of your optic nerve

41:58.114 --> 42:00.016
and your healthy spinal cord.

42:01.985 --> 42:05.052
Eric, we don't know
exactly what causes this

42:05.054 --> 42:06.623
and it's very rare,

42:08.224 --> 42:10.760
but there's nothing you
could've done to prevent it.

42:15.164 --> 42:16.699
What's gonna happen to me?

43:06.884 --> 43:08.717
A household water heater

43:08.719 --> 43:10.818
can boil hundreds of gallons
of water a day, right?

43:10.820 --> 43:12.854
But this wouldn't be an
ordinary gravity filter.

43:12.856 --> 43:13.991
I mean, this would...

43:15.259 --> 43:16.624
Hello.

43:16.626 --> 43:18.025
I'm sorry.

43:18.027 --> 43:19.760
This wouldn't be an
ordinary gravity filter.

43:19.762 --> 43:21.195
You could use the pumps

43:21.197 --> 43:22.966
to force the water
through the filter.

43:24.934 --> 43:28.202
I know, but I'm
not a scientist...

43:28.204 --> 43:29.873
Okay, I understand.

44:21.992 --> 44:22.858
Oh God.

44:22.860 --> 44:24.092
Oh God, help me.

44:24.094 --> 44:25.362
Oh God, help me.

44:50.086 --> 44:51.853
This episode
was much more severe

44:51.855 --> 44:53.454
than the mild ones he's had

44:53.456 --> 44:56.958
and caused irreversible
inflammation of his spinal cord.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.793
Optica is progressing...

44:58.795 --> 45:00.996
He has some left arm paralysis
and right leg weakness.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.298
Optic nerve damage causing
significantly blurred division.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.766
Of a chronic pain and
become more disabled

45:05.768 --> 45:07.202
throughout his life.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.105
I'm so sorry.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.023
Hey.

45:27.724 --> 45:28.391
How you doing?

45:30.827 --> 45:34.095
The doctor said that
you've responded great

45:34.097 --> 45:35.030
to the medication.

45:35.032 --> 45:39.001
So that's great.

45:42.972 --> 45:46.210
I made some new
playlists for you.

45:47.777 --> 45:51.179
I'll just put 'em
on your table there.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.882
You know, you don't
need to feel weird

45:53.884 --> 45:55.383
or anything around me.

45:55.385 --> 45:58.820
Not that you would or
should for that matter.

45:58.822 --> 46:01.856
Besides, my mom already
bought you all this new crap

46:01.858 --> 46:03.358
from Ikea that she
made me put together.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.096
So you can't really
decide to move now.

46:09.900 --> 46:10.768
All right.

46:12.135 --> 46:15.170
Well, hey, I gotta
get going to class,

46:15.172 --> 46:18.442
but I'll stop by afterwards.

46:19.476 --> 46:20.344
Okay?

46:22.012 --> 46:23.144
Okay.

46:23.146 --> 46:26.884
Well, yeah, I'll see you later.

46:43.065 --> 46:44.065
Be careful.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.016
Okay.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.821
That's cool.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.363
I got you.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.130
Easy.

47:16.132 --> 47:17.201
Easy does it.

47:56.273 --> 47:57.173
Any change?

48:02.211 --> 48:03.644
I've been concerned

48:03.646 --> 48:05.012
because you skipped
several appointments.

48:05.014 --> 48:05.949
I'm sorry.

48:07.617 --> 48:09.251
I've just been really busy
with the holidays and all.

48:09.253 --> 48:10.918
I see.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.487
And how have you been adjusting?

48:12.489 --> 48:13.523
Just peachy.

48:15.358 --> 48:18.994
Eric, I would encourage
you to utilize the services

48:18.996 --> 48:20.631
that are available
to assist you.

48:24.568 --> 48:28.302
Now, it's a little trickier
with the blurry vision

48:28.304 --> 48:32.643
and the leg weakness
and the arm immobility.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.177
Thank you for that
comprehensive recap.

48:36.179 --> 48:37.345
Sure thing.

48:37.347 --> 48:38.348
Here you go.

48:45.489 --> 48:47.554
Okay. That's where we are today.

48:47.556 --> 48:51.492
Now, it's very important
for you to learn

48:51.494 --> 48:53.994
to do things for yourself,

48:53.996 --> 48:57.164
so you don't have to depend
on other people all the time.

48:57.166 --> 48:58.199
Wow.

48:58.201 --> 49:00.101
That was beautiful.

49:00.103 --> 49:02.539
I think I'll needlepoint that
and put it above the mantle.

49:08.177 --> 49:09.045
Shit.

49:10.313 --> 49:11.248
I'm reaching him.

49:24.728 --> 49:29.229
I truly believe that
I have the favor of God.

49:29.231 --> 49:34.101
And the good news is that
the Lord wants all of us

49:34.103 --> 49:36.739
to have thriving
and abundant lives.

49:38.608 --> 49:43.046
He wants everyone of us to
be healthy and successful.

49:44.681 --> 49:48.652
I have a vibrant life filled
with blessing I don't deserve.

49:50.454 --> 49:52.019
Blessing after blessing after
blessing after blessing...

49:52.021 --> 49:52.688
Hey.

49:54.557 --> 49:56.257
It sounds like God
is your trophy wife.

49:57.693 --> 49:58.561
Eric.

50:00.364 --> 50:04.365
Been a while since you stopped
by here to argue with me.

50:04.367 --> 50:06.266
Everything all right?

50:06.268 --> 50:07.769
Oh, you know, other than
having a fucked spinal cord,

50:07.771 --> 50:09.506
just living the dream.

50:10.606 --> 50:12.139
Spinal cord?

50:12.141 --> 50:13.009
I'm sorry.

50:15.478 --> 50:16.346
That's it?

50:18.248 --> 50:21.016
And if you need
His healing powers,

50:21.018 --> 50:23.017
just call on Him
and He'll be there.

50:25.355 --> 50:26.523
Amen and hallelujah.

50:30.659 --> 50:31.527
Oh my God.

50:33.063 --> 50:33.730
It's a miracle.

50:36.266 --> 50:37.200
Are you serious?

50:42.639 --> 50:44.041
How's it feel to get out?

50:47.510 --> 50:49.278
Well, feels good to me.

50:51.481 --> 50:53.380
Oh, hey.

50:53.382 --> 50:54.349
Do you mind if I say hi to
a buddy of mine from school?

50:54.351 --> 50:55.215
Go.

50:55.217 --> 50:56.383
Cool.

50:56.385 --> 50:57.385
What's up?

50:57.387 --> 50:58.519
Hey, Stu. How are you?

50:58.521 --> 50:59.521
How are you doin', man.

50:59.523 --> 51:00.356
Good to see you, buddy.

51:05.327 --> 51:06.262
How was Africa?

51:11.835 --> 51:13.135
I love your tan.

51:17.740 --> 51:18.840
Oh my God.

51:18.842 --> 51:19.709
Vanessa.

51:20.710 --> 51:22.209
Hey.

51:22.211 --> 51:24.545
How the hell are you?

51:24.547 --> 51:26.113
You know what?

51:26.115 --> 51:27.414
I would totally
invite you to join us,

51:27.416 --> 51:29.717
but we were just about to leave.

51:29.719 --> 51:31.788
No, I'm not
staying. I'm just...

51:33.690 --> 51:36.090
My roommate thought
she saw you here

51:36.092 --> 51:37.624
and I didn't believe her.

51:37.626 --> 51:39.661
What's happened to
you? You look awful.

51:39.663 --> 51:40.530
Thanks.

51:41.797 --> 51:43.130
I'm fine.

51:43.132 --> 51:44.132
How long have you been back?

51:44.134 --> 51:44.701
It didn't work out?

51:46.802 --> 51:49.336
Did you get my drawing?

51:49.338 --> 51:50.838
Oh, you know
what? That's my bad.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.173
Dude, I'm sorry.

51:52.175 --> 51:53.173
I totally forgot to give it...

51:53.175 --> 51:54.374
You gave it to me.

51:54.376 --> 51:56.110
No, I'm pretty
sure I forgot...

51:56.112 --> 51:57.547
No, you didn't forget.

51:58.681 --> 51:59.548
It was great.

52:01.117 --> 52:02.249
Yeah, well you
said you never had

52:02.251 --> 52:03.353
your portrait made before, so...

52:05.521 --> 52:07.690
Congratulations on
winning that scholarship.

52:09.726 --> 52:12.260
Your story and your
picture were really moving.

52:12.262 --> 52:14.896
Can you believe they called
him an idealist though?

52:14.898 --> 52:16.764
- This guy?
- My dad said

52:16.766 --> 52:18.635
it might open up some new
doors for you for photography.

52:20.170 --> 52:21.505
I'm doing some
new things instead.

52:22.672 --> 52:23.773
Yeah, I can see that.

52:26.208 --> 52:28.711
Basically you quit everything
when you get tired of it.

52:32.148 --> 52:32.815
Well,

52:35.784 --> 52:37.851
I never lied to you, Eric.

52:37.853 --> 52:40.256
And I really hope I
never see you again.

52:49.666 --> 52:51.499
I'm sorry, man.

52:51.501 --> 52:52.369
Are you okay?

52:55.838 --> 52:57.740
You told me she drew a circus.

53:00.409 --> 53:01.543
I'm sorry.

53:01.545 --> 53:02.646
I thought it would upset you.

53:23.833 --> 53:26.266
What the hell
did you do in here?

53:26.268 --> 53:27.969
She never wants
to see me again.

53:27.971 --> 53:31.305
And you, you wouldn't
want to either

53:31.307 --> 53:32.673
if you knew who I really am.

53:32.675 --> 53:34.275
All right, you're
talking smack.

53:34.277 --> 53:35.943
Shut up. I can't
even see shit.

53:35.945 --> 53:37.413
Hey, hey, hey.

53:39.983 --> 53:43.253
Do you know there are
millions of people

53:44.588 --> 53:49.226
who are at risk of death
because of drought?

53:51.628 --> 53:53.494
Good segue, buddy.

53:53.496 --> 53:55.599
But yeah, I think I heard
something about that.

53:57.266 --> 53:59.266
See, here's the thing.

53:59.268 --> 54:03.637
If I was God and I was gonna
drop a drought on some folks

54:03.639 --> 54:08.612
for the hell of it, I
personally would at least try

54:09.980 --> 54:11.845
to drop it on people
that could handle it.

54:11.847 --> 54:16.583
Not people that are
hardly surviving as it is.

54:16.585 --> 54:18.487
No, drunk man.

54:19.889 --> 54:21.021
Area's just prone
to more droughts.

54:21.023 --> 54:23.559
There's no cosmic conspiracy.

54:25.795 --> 54:28.262
And seriously, why do you
keep trying to believe

54:28.264 --> 54:31.634
in some supposedly omnipotent
being you don't even like?

54:34.471 --> 54:37.507
I was just trying
to be a good person.

54:56.293 --> 54:59.927
You're saying you want me
to record a message for Eric?

54:59.929 --> 55:02.429
Yeah, it's this new
thing that Eric's doing.

55:02.431 --> 55:03.930
He thinks that recorded messages

55:03.932 --> 55:05.867
are more personal
than written ones.

55:05.869 --> 55:06.800
Stu, what's going on?

55:06.802 --> 55:08.735
Nothing.

55:08.737 --> 55:10.606
Look, you said you didn't
ever wanna see him again.

55:11.675 --> 55:13.307
He looked terrible when I saw-

55:13.309 --> 55:14.508
- You know, well, time's
kinder to some of us.

55:14.510 --> 55:15.642
So I'll have him
give you a call.

55:15.644 --> 55:16.911
Stu.

55:16.913 --> 55:17.912
Yeah.

55:17.914 --> 55:19.646
Don't you have class?

55:19.648 --> 55:20.516
You know what?

55:21.583 --> 55:22.751
Seriously, what are the odds?

55:24.621 --> 55:25.619
You know...

55:25.621 --> 55:27.021
What are you doing?

55:27.023 --> 55:27.891
Nothing.

55:29.925 --> 55:31.559
Please stop leaving
your crap on the floor?

55:31.561 --> 55:32.793
Yeah, you're right.

55:32.795 --> 55:33.663
I'm sorry.

55:35.030 --> 55:37.030
And even if
you're on a diet,

55:37.032 --> 55:39.700
look at just some of the
great foods you can prepare

55:39.702 --> 55:42.003
in your new Showtime rotisserie.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.403
Hey, man.

55:43.405 --> 55:45.106
Hey.

55:45.108 --> 55:46.474
Anything good on?

55:46.476 --> 55:48.376
No.

55:48.378 --> 55:50.912
An eight-pound
mouthwatering pork loin roast-

55:50.914 --> 55:54.048
- So there's this thing
I need to tell you,

55:54.050 --> 55:56.450
but I'm not really
sure how to say it.

55:56.452 --> 55:57.851
You could just say it.

55:57.853 --> 55:59.686
Okay, brilliant.

55:59.688 --> 56:01.857
Just promise me you're not
gonna try to kill the messenger.

56:08.864 --> 56:10.399
Broski, you okay?

56:14.471 --> 56:15.670
She freaked, man.

56:15.672 --> 56:17.104
I didn't know what to do.

56:17.106 --> 56:18.438
You should have
told me right away.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.907
I tried, but she took off

56:19.909 --> 56:21.541
and I had to make
sure she was okay.

56:21.543 --> 56:23.411
What happened? Is she okay?

56:23.413 --> 56:26.012
I chased her down the street
and we went out to coffee.

56:26.014 --> 56:27.749
She was a total mess.

56:27.751 --> 56:29.717
I missed my class
because she was sobbing

56:29.719 --> 56:32.153
- for like two hours.
- I don't wanna hear this.

56:32.155 --> 56:34.054
No, no, no. It's a good thing.

56:34.056 --> 56:35.655
I think I helped her like
process it a little bit.

56:35.657 --> 56:38.793
I gave her like the
basic Wikipedia version,

56:38.795 --> 56:41.729
with maybe just a
little added commentary.

56:41.731 --> 56:43.664
You promised me you would
never talk to her about this.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.032
Dude, I promised that
like six months ago.

56:46.034 --> 56:47.635
Besides, I kind of
figured the jig was up

56:47.637 --> 56:48.936
when she was standing
at our front door

56:48.938 --> 56:50.539
and you didn't even notice.

56:51.907 --> 56:53.508
Shit man, I'm sorry.

56:53.510 --> 56:54.778
She wants you to call her.

56:56.980 --> 56:58.845
This does not go here.

56:58.847 --> 57:00.483
I had to change a light bulb.

57:13.195 --> 57:14.795
Whoopsie.

57:14.797 --> 57:15.731
I got it. I got it.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.666
I got a surprise for you before
I head off to the airport

57:19.668 --> 57:22.570
that might cheer
you up a little bit.

57:22.572 --> 57:26.675
So, I want to do our Christmas
gift exchange a little early.

57:27.876 --> 57:29.142
You're kidding, right?

57:29.144 --> 57:30.478
No, come on.

57:30.480 --> 57:32.447
I know that you're still pissed

57:32.449 --> 57:34.684
about the whole
Vanessa thing, but...

57:36.985 --> 57:37.985
What is that?

57:37.987 --> 57:39.122
It's a dog, homie.

57:41.056 --> 57:42.657
Chill out.

57:42.659 --> 57:44.592
That's not a dog.
It's a fricking hamster.

57:44.594 --> 57:45.927
No, it's a teacup poodle.

57:45.929 --> 57:47.461
Merry Christmas.

57:47.463 --> 57:48.896
Do you wanna hold him?

57:48.898 --> 57:50.764
Why the hell would
you give me a poodle?

57:50.766 --> 57:52.233
What do you mean? They're
like the smartest breed.

57:52.235 --> 57:53.633
Check it out. I already
taught them how to sit.

57:53.635 --> 57:54.635
Sit.

57:54.637 --> 57:55.670
Sit.

57:55.672 --> 57:57.472
Oh, look at that, huh?

57:57.474 --> 57:58.905
And his uncle's cousin's brother

57:58.907 --> 58:00.041
was like a poodle
state champion.

58:00.043 --> 58:01.943
I can't believe you did this.

58:01.945 --> 58:02.943
Don't worry about the
apartment's no dog policy.

58:02.945 --> 58:04.845
I talked to the manager.

58:04.847 --> 58:05.713
I told him you needed him
and he said it was okay.

58:05.715 --> 58:08.117
So I got you

58:09.552 --> 58:11.985
a bed and some food,

58:11.987 --> 58:12.855
and a bowl.

58:14.523 --> 58:15.557
I don't want a dog.

58:16.659 --> 58:17.527
Take him back.

58:24.967 --> 58:26.969
You made him feel bad.

58:29.606 --> 58:31.037
Hey man, it's cool.

58:31.039 --> 58:32.840
I never asked if you
were a dog person.

58:32.842 --> 58:34.010
I just thought that...

58:36.278 --> 58:38.679
Well, I'm sure I can find
a nice geriatric couple

58:38.681 --> 58:40.113
that'll take him or...

58:40.115 --> 58:42.016
I appreciate you
thinking of me.

58:42.018 --> 58:45.019
You know I'm only gonna
be in Aspen for a few days.

58:45.021 --> 58:46.987
My parents still
want you to come.

58:46.989 --> 58:48.523
That's nice.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.559
Thank them for me.

58:51.628 --> 58:54.831
You know, between my
classes and my internship,

58:56.632 --> 58:58.967
I'm not really gonna be around
a whole lot next semester.

59:01.871 --> 59:03.871
I should get going
to the airport.

59:03.873 --> 59:06.641
So what do you want me
to do with tiny Tim here?

59:06.643 --> 59:09.644
I mean, I'll take him
as soon as I get back.

59:09.646 --> 59:10.313
Fine.

59:11.914 --> 59:12.782
Okay.

59:14.182 --> 59:15.184
What's that smell?

59:17.286 --> 59:18.920
He took a dump in
my bed, didn't he?

59:18.922 --> 59:20.657
It's a good
thing he's small.

59:58.795 --> 59:59.662
Jeffrey.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.767
I can't believe it.

01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:10.271
I know I shouldn't be surprised
you're all grown up but...

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.938
How'd you find me?

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.143
The lady at the
library helped me.

01:00:15.978 --> 01:00:17.378
It was a little bit tricky
using your middle name,

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.648
but I'd recognize these
baby blues anywhere.

01:00:20.983 --> 01:00:23.016
And aren't you the
good little Samaritan?

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:24.686
And winning 10 grand to boot.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.220
It's just a scholarship.

01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:28.991
Who knew I'd raise
such a smarty pants.

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:33.661
It's freezing out here.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.896
Are you gonna invite
me in or what?

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.130
Fuck.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.905
Oh, look at the puppy.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.141
He's so cute.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:05.928
I don't...

01:01:08.297 --> 01:01:09.898
I never heard of that before.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.767
You're not...

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:14.434
It's not...

01:01:14.436 --> 01:01:15.304
Fatal?

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.208
No, unfortunately not.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:27.882
Well, no big deal. Shit happens.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.018
Yeah, it does.

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.170
Here, let me.

01:02:02.117 --> 01:02:03.786
Nice place you got here.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:06.422
Live alone?

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.092
No.

01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:12.929
You get a girlfriend?

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:14.730
No.

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:20.836
You get by okay?

01:02:22.304 --> 01:02:23.172
Yup.

01:02:28.143 --> 01:02:29.244
So are you clean?

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:35.751
Yeah.

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.420
A long time now.

01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:45.327
Well, I'm surprised
to see you here.

01:02:47.195 --> 01:02:48.297
Surprised?

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.802
That a mother would wanna see
her only child after 10 years?

01:02:54.836 --> 01:02:55.505
It's 12.

01:02:57.072 --> 01:02:59.940
It's the day after my
13th birthday, remember?

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.142
You got me a lottery ticket.

01:03:02.144 --> 01:03:03.278
Of course I remember.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.150
You just took off and I didn't
even know if you were alive.

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:13.222
Anyway,

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:16.458
I have to be somewhere.

01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:23.132
I'll come by again and
lend a hand or something.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.474
I remember being so sure

01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:37.078
that I had picked the
winning numbers for you too.

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.293
Are you done?

01:04:30.532 --> 01:04:32.599
Hey, you stupid
dog, where are you?

01:04:32.601 --> 01:04:33.969
Come on, where'd you go?

01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:52.254
Get out of the road, you bum.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.905
Rough night?

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.537
Oh my God.

01:05:11.539 --> 01:05:12.675
Where the hell am I?

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.943
Hell's about right.

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:16.612
Hey.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:18.681
What's your name?

01:05:20.181 --> 01:05:21.049
Amy.

01:05:24.686 --> 01:05:26.586
What's wrong with you?

01:05:26.588 --> 01:05:27.456
Several things.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.133
What?

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:43.103
I was just looking at all
the religious books you've got.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.206
Yeah, it was a phase.

01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.141
You want 'em?

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.544
Phase?

01:05:50.278 --> 01:05:52.681
So you're like an
atheist now or something?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.551
I wish.

01:05:59.454 --> 01:06:01.188
It's complicated.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.191
How can it not be?

01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:12.268
As for me, I definitely
believe in God.

01:06:13.068 --> 01:06:13.635
You do?

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:17.606
Oh yes.

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:23.545
I love him.

01:06:34.356 --> 01:06:35.224
No.

01:08:10.418 --> 01:08:12.251
Just a second.

01:08:12.253 --> 01:08:13.521
Eric, it's Ed.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.345
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.317
Hey, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:45.118
How much I miss
having you around?

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.721
And not just 'cause you fix
things for me on the house.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:51.191
JP and I were thinking about
doing a little fishing.

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:53.729
I thought I'd see
what you're up to.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:57.464
Oh, come on. I'll take
you out for an hour.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.799
I'll bring you back.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.667
That's it.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:04.571
I'm not really
feeling up to it today.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.540
I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.808
Come on. You know, I
don't pull that crap.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.578
I just want to hang out
a little bit, come on.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.551
Who's your little friend?

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:17.617
I'm watching him for Stu.

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:19.318
Oh, bring him along.

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:20.421
We'll use him for bait.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.871
Want some coffee?

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:38.238
No, thanks.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.408
Ed, I'm sorry I never
called you back.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.544
I meant to. I just-

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:44.712
- You had your reasons.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.215
Christmas is such a
dichotomy, ain't it?

01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:52.585
Happy for some, sad for others.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:53.520
It's just a day.

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.463
I used to spend
every Christmas

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:06.200
waiting for my dad to come home.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:06.869
Where was he?

01:10:07.869 --> 01:10:09.503
Don't know.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.873
Sometimes he'd be
gone for months,

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:16.843
but no matter what,
for whatever reason,

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:20.382
he'd always come
home for Christmas.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:26.956
Christmas when I was 14, first
time that he never showed.

01:10:29.324 --> 01:10:31.260
I had stayed up all night

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.663
like a little kid
waiting around for Santa.

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.532
When did he come back?

01:10:39.534 --> 01:10:40.802
Never saw him again.

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:47.408
I hated that I kept hoping
that he'd show up every year.

01:10:53.548 --> 01:10:55.951
Hell, I'm almost 70 years old.

01:10:57.485 --> 01:10:59.320
I'm still hoping
he'll show up today.

01:11:00.521 --> 01:11:01.556
It's crazy.

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:06.261
That's not crazy.

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.011
Vanna, what are
you doing here?

01:11:23.578 --> 01:11:25.044
Mom told grandma
that Eric's with you

01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:26.847
and grandma told me.

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:28.684
That big busybody.

01:11:29.784 --> 01:11:30.918
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey.

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:35.022
Can I talk to you?

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:37.359
Actually, your dad was
just about to take me home.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:39.762
Please?

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:51.937
You're kinda freaking me
out there being so quiet.

01:11:51.939 --> 01:11:53.341
It's not really like you.

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:56.543
I'm sorry.

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.411
No, it's fine.

01:11:58.413 --> 01:12:01.015
I just expected you to
hit me with 20 questions.

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:03.983
Well, yeah, I mean
I have questions-

01:12:03.985 --> 01:12:05.953
- So your dad says
you're in grad school.

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:08.988
- Yeah.
- That's great.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.858
That's great.

01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:14.460
Eric, I want you to
come over to the house.

01:12:14.462 --> 01:12:15.331
What?

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.464
- No.
- No, no, it's okay.

01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:19.499
I mean, it's just my
grandparents there

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.634
and it's nothing big.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.971
Just for a little while, please.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:27.876
Please.

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:47.460
How about some of Ethel's
cranberry gelatin relish, Eric?

01:12:47.462 --> 01:12:48.130
No, thank you.

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.062
Dad.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:51.397
Here. That enough?

01:12:51.399 --> 01:12:52.833
He said he didn't want any.

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.668
The boy's gotta
eat. He looks awful.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.035
- Grandpa.
- Give him a ham.

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:57.670
He needs protein.

01:12:57.672 --> 01:12:58.839
Dad, how are you
feeling these days?

01:12:58.841 --> 01:12:59.973
Not good at all?

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:01.641
Eric, I still don't understand

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.410
what really happened to you.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:04.710
Mama, let the boy eat.

01:13:04.712 --> 01:13:06.112
No, no. It's okay.

01:13:06.114 --> 01:13:09.449
I told you Ethel about
this wacky business

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.819
with his spinal column
eating away at itself.

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:15.688
It's so interesting that
it affects so many things.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:17.691
I know. It's crazy, huh?

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:20.160
Well, don't you worry
about a thing, Eric.

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:24.097
I have many friends over
at the Lutheran Manor

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:25.866
who have problems
with their eyes,

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:29.870
or legs or their arms.

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:32.539
They're getting along just fine.

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:33.641
That's good to know.

01:13:48.055 --> 01:13:50.589
I was in
there in the hospital

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:53.994
a couple of months ago
for the colon thing.

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.728
The oscopy.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.063
They took out a
couple of polyps.

01:13:58.065 --> 01:14:00.166
Uncle Howard
thinks Eric's problem

01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:02.501
can be caused by glaucoma.

01:14:02.503 --> 01:14:03.637
Glaucoma?

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.037
I have some glaucoma.

01:14:05.039 --> 01:14:07.808
Poor
Eric. Such a shame.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:09.809
And he was so handsome.

01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:11.445
Now, he
looks like something

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.446
that crawled out of a trash bag.

01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:23.692
He didn't look good,
I can tell you that.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.187
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:56.089
Merry Christmas.

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:58.090
Oh, sorry.

01:14:58.092 --> 01:14:59.625
You called Stu?

01:14:59.627 --> 01:15:00.828
Yeah, I gotta get back.

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.268
Thursday
night into Friday,

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.936
those will be the worst
travel conditions.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.071
This is a powerful winter storm.

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.705
There's the low pressure area.

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:13.839
Let's put this in the most-

01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:15.008
- What the hell are you doing?

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:17.913
Why would you bring him here?

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:24.284
Bro, I'm sorry.

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:26.753
But it's nasty out there and
they even shut down the airport

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.120
right after I arrived.

01:15:28.122 --> 01:15:29.257
It took me two
hours to drive here.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.858
We're not gonna make
it back tonight.

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.727
It's a nightmare.

01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:36.161
Corn relish comes shooting
out of me like bullets.

01:15:36.163 --> 01:15:37.198
Maybe it'll be fun.

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.968
Some nice hot tea.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.602
I'm so glad you
guys are staying.

01:15:43.604 --> 01:15:45.706
It will be so much more
festive with you here.

01:15:46.641 --> 01:15:47.542
Here we go.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.675
Here you go, sweetie.

01:15:49.677 --> 01:15:51.143
- No, thank you.
- Okay, sweetie.

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:52.812
I'm gonna put you
in Vanessa's room.

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:55.147
I hope you don't mind
sharing Vanessa's bed.

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:56.683
No.

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.754
We're both mature adults.

01:15:59.787 --> 01:16:00.655
Good.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:08.894
Do you wanna know
what I'm wearing?

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:10.930
Stu, jeez no.

01:16:10.932 --> 01:16:12.831
Sorry.

01:16:12.833 --> 01:16:15.770
I just know how you feel about
full disclosure these days.

01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:20.141
Take your dog.

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:30.817
Hey, could I ask you something?

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:32.054
Yeah, shoot.

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.955
I mean, I can mostly tell,

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.960
but Vanessa looks the
same to you, right?

01:16:40.895 --> 01:16:43.097
Yeah, I'd say so.

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:52.339
She was wearing this top thing

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.008
that you could totally see
her bra straps through,

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.309
and some jeans
that if I might add

01:16:57.311 --> 01:16:59.280
were rather tight in the ass.

01:17:01.115 --> 01:17:02.915
I never thought she
was particularly hot,

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:05.753
but she was pretty
smoking in 'em.

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.630
Well, I'm beat.

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:18.833
You don't snore, do you?

01:18:11.185 --> 01:18:12.420
Stu, go back to sleep.

01:18:14.088 --> 01:18:14.956
It's Ed.

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.857
Sorry, I heard a noise.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.861
I thought I'd come see
if everything was okay.

01:18:21.195 --> 01:18:23.830
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:25.197
That's okay.

01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:26.068
No problem.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.269
Well, goodnight.

01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:31.838
Hey, Ed.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.708
Yeah.

01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:36.076
Do you remember
that woman from Kenya

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.245
I was telling you about?

01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:40.082
Yeah.

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.349
Her entire life
has been nothing

01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:46.121
but hunger and thirst, pain.

01:18:49.323 --> 01:18:50.991
Suffering from day one.

01:18:52.293 --> 01:18:53.327
It's heartbreaking.

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:59.734
Most people wouldn't even
give it a second thought.

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:02.104
But you do.

01:19:05.172 --> 01:19:06.505
Do you think that
there are people

01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:08.777
that are just doomed or cursed?

01:19:14.882 --> 01:19:17.483
There's an old Navajo
proverb that I love.

01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:22.490
It says you can't wake a man
who's pretending to be asleep.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.893
Now, you can pretend that
you've thrown the towel in

01:19:27.895 --> 01:19:31.966
and like, you're so pissed,
you can't even think straight,

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:37.105
but you're still wide
awake, aren't you?

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.016
- You wanna sit down?
- No.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.288
You all right?

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.321
Hurt my ankle.

01:19:56.323 --> 01:19:57.358
Oh man. How?

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.360
I went home last weekend.

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.997
Got in a fight with my stepdad.

01:20:03.364 --> 01:20:04.429
Who won.

01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:05.300
I did.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.336
So the asshole pushed
me down the stairs.

01:20:10.204 --> 01:20:11.305
It didn't hurt though.

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.943
Well, you're
tougher than I was.

01:20:18.846 --> 01:20:23.117
Here, I wanted to give you this.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.387
I'm not gonna
take your camera.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:29.022
Right, 'cause I'm
really gonna be using it.

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.159
Here, I want you to have it.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.527
What am I gonna do with it?

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.398
Probably just sell it.

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.266
That's all right.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.136
Just before you sell
it, mess around with it.

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:44.072
Best way to learn.

01:20:53.914 --> 01:20:54.582
Hey.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.352
Hey.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.419
Stu, ready?

01:21:00.421 --> 01:21:02.321
Yeah, just about.

01:21:02.323 --> 01:21:04.590
He's getting lectured by
my grandpa in Lutheranism

01:21:04.592 --> 01:21:06.862
and the light bulb crisis.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:12.065
Whoa, there's a trash can.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:13.400
- Do you need help?
- No.

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:19.039
I've been praying
really hard for you.

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.107
You're going through
so much right now,

01:21:22.109 --> 01:21:23.242
but if you just hang in there,

01:21:23.244 --> 01:21:24.211
things are gonna get better.

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:27.246
Look, I'm just trying to...

01:21:27.248 --> 01:21:29.050
Well, I don't need you to.

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:30.919
Fine.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.420
You know, it must be so
awesome going through life

01:21:35.422 --> 01:21:37.357
not needing anything or anyone.

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:38.223
I'm gonna go find Stu.

01:21:38.225 --> 01:21:39.358
Okay. Yeah.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.362
Let's see you go find Stu.

01:21:41.962 --> 01:21:42.629
What do you want
from me, Vanessa?

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:43.265
Nothing.

01:21:44.632 --> 01:21:46.501
You know, I used
to want you though.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.168
Not that that matters now.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.937
I would have been
there for you though.

01:21:51.939 --> 01:21:53.572
Why?

01:21:53.574 --> 01:21:54.907
To tell me stuff like
things are gonna get better?

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:55.642
Is that wrong?

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.976
Yes.

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.413
Because sometimes they don't.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.446
Or is that just foreign
to someone like you?

01:22:01.448 --> 01:22:03.516
What is your problem with me?

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:07.152
Is my life not tragic
enough for you or something?

01:22:07.154 --> 01:22:08.588
Like how much crap do
I have to go through

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.156
for you to sanction me

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.223
into your elite
little suffering club?

01:22:11.225 --> 01:22:12.357
Just stop it.

01:22:12.359 --> 01:22:13.960
Do I have to lose my parents

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.661
or have my face ripped
off by barbed wire

01:22:15.663 --> 01:22:17.965
or be starving with malaria?

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.036
Would any of that
be enough for you?

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.102
- What?
- What?

01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:26.173
What did you just
say about barbed wire?

01:22:30.177 --> 01:22:32.010
I don't know.

01:22:32.012 --> 01:22:33.446
I read about a woman
whose face got ripped off

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:36.084
by barbed wire when she
was climbing a fence.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.519
It's not funny. It's horrible.

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:42.455
I know.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:46.227
Having your face ripped off
by barbed wire sounds awful.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:51.697
I just don't think I
ever want something bad

01:22:51.699 --> 01:22:52.567
to happen to you.

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.705
What?

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:00.005
What's going on, Eric?

01:23:00.007 --> 01:23:01.406
What's going on?

01:23:01.408 --> 01:23:02.308
It's my fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:03.175
What, what?

01:23:03.177 --> 01:23:04.509
Sit down.

01:23:04.511 --> 01:23:05.380
It's my leg.

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.679
It's fine. It's normal.

01:23:07.681 --> 01:23:08.982
It's fine.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:09.517
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.253
This was a mistake coming here.

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.187
Eric.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.155
Wait.

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.555
Shit.

01:23:50.557 --> 01:23:51.691
You know, I used to
stare at your paintings

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.427
trying to figure you out?

01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:55.495
They only told me
what I already knew

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.062
after talking to you
for five minutes.

01:23:57.064 --> 01:23:58.464
I know what
you're trying to do.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.598
You're just scared
of facing things

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.233
you don't have the answers for.

01:24:01.235 --> 01:24:02.668
You're scared of
opening your eyes

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:02.804
and seeing things
as they really are.

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.645
V, I'm sorry.

01:24:11.712 --> 01:24:13.414
Just so you know, I don't...

01:24:32.266 --> 01:24:34.200
Crap. Kelley's here.

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:35.567
Where have you been?

01:24:35.569 --> 01:24:38.504
At Vanessa's
house. I texted you.

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:39.371
You texted me?

01:24:39.373 --> 01:24:40.807
Yeah.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.442
It's Christmas
day, you schlarb.

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:44.343
I know. I drove
as fast as I could.

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:45.745
What are you talking about?

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.813
Do you know how
long I was waiting?

01:24:47.815 --> 01:24:49.415
You do this every time.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.817
I was sitting there
with my parents.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.454
They were wondering
where you were.

01:24:54.288 --> 01:24:56.222
Someone has got
to say something.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:59.525
Eric, are you aware that
every time we go out,

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.794
Stu insists on coming
back here to check on you?

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.629
That is not true.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.464
Look, I know that
you got a raw deal,

01:25:05.466 --> 01:25:09.269
but you have got to stop
relying on Stu for everything.

01:25:10.204 --> 01:25:11.204
I don't need Stu.

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:12.671
See, I told you.

01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:14.639
So Eric
has nothing to do

01:25:14.641 --> 01:25:17.144
with you turning down
that fellowship in Belize?

01:25:22.516 --> 01:25:23.417
What fellowship?

01:25:25.886 --> 01:25:27.285
You know?

01:25:27.287 --> 01:25:28.620
I told you.

01:25:28.622 --> 01:25:29.621
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

01:25:29.623 --> 01:25:30.524
I thought that...

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:33.326
It's nothing.

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.729
I decided not to take it anyway.

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:38.900
Why not?

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:41.302
Come on.

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.137
Who wants to live in Belize?

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.671
Besides, you know I hate
moving, and the ocean.

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:48.374
It was a great opportunity,

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:50.576
and he was handpicked
out of 1000 applicants.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.245
I didn't wanna take it.

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:53.646
So drop it.

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:55.147
- You are such a liar.
- Shut up, Kelley.

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.848
No, you know what?

01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:58.451
I am not gonna sit back and
watch you trash your life

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.288
because someone else
chooses to trash theirs.

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:09.928
If I find out that
I had anything to do

01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:11.865
with you not taking
that fellowship...

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:25.277
Why would you do that?

01:26:25.279 --> 01:26:26.678
Why did you have
to do that today?

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.281
Because somebody
had to say something.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.415
No, I would have told
him if you would...

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:31.416
When were you gonna tell him?

01:26:31.418 --> 01:26:32.852
It doesn't matter.

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.586
I don't need your
help with this.

01:26:34.588 --> 01:26:36.188
- You don't need my help?
- No, I don't.

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:36.356
- Okay.
- Goodbye. Merry Christmas.

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:45.533
Hey, man.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.601
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.535
She's pissed, because I
won't move in with her.

01:26:50.537 --> 01:26:52.639
Yeah, well, she's
right about one thing.

01:26:54.841 --> 01:26:55.710
You're a liar.

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.778
Go to Belize.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.513
What if I did go?

01:27:01.515 --> 01:27:02.583
And what would you do?

01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:05.585
You spend all the money
Uncle Sam gives you

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.887
on nothing but booze,
cigarettes and cereal.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.789
Wear the same two disgusting
shirts all the time

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.656
and you generally look like
complete and utter shit.

01:27:11.658 --> 01:27:13.558
So yeah, man. Yeah.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.928
You're the poster child
of self sufficiency.

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.530
- Absolutely.
- It's my life.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:18.964
Yup. It is.

01:27:18.966 --> 01:27:20.833
What's all this shit of
indeterminate origin?

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.835
You're doing drugs now?

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:23.902
How about your scholarship?

01:27:23.904 --> 01:27:24.805
Plan on using it?

01:27:26.506 --> 01:27:27.906
- No.
- Yeah.

01:27:27.908 --> 01:27:29.442
I guess it's kinda
hard to go to college

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:30.979
if you haven't finished
high school yet.

01:27:33.347 --> 01:27:36.415
You got a letter from the
department of education

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:38.453
asking when you're
gonna start your GED.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.655
Can't just cease to
exist, so how about it?

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.290
Did you even finish high school?

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.290
Why do you care?

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:46.826
I don't even know.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.427
God.

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.263
In the few years
of living together,

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:51.599
you'd figure it's something
that might've come up.

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.567
The least you can do is
let some sunlight in here.

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.001
What the hell for, you moron.

01:27:56.003 --> 01:27:57.836
For vitamin fucking
D man. I don't know.

01:27:57.838 --> 01:27:59.472
You know what? You're just
pissed 'cause you're stuck here.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:02.441
I'm not stuck here.
I'm going back to Kenya.

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.442
Oh my God. That's ludicrous.

01:28:04.444 --> 01:28:06.611
God, man. You're screwed
up, you know that?

01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:08.046
Man, I don't even think
you care about Kenya.

01:28:08.048 --> 01:28:09.514
I think you just use
them as an excuse

01:28:09.516 --> 01:28:11.452
so you can get out of here.

01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:18.023
Get off me.

01:28:18.025 --> 01:28:18.960
Get off me.

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.518
Not now, JP.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.587
Take a 'lude, Vanna.

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.487
Eric gave me his camera.

01:28:49.489 --> 01:28:50.358
He did?

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:54.761
And I threw all of his
pictures on your dad's computer.

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:58.566
Thought you might like to see
them before I delete them.

01:29:40.073 --> 01:29:41.639
Stay right there.

01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:42.676
I'm gonna grab a camera.

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.821
Matua, I'll be able to get
around on my own, I promise.

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:57.757
You won't have to
do anything for me.

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:59.993
I'll live in the village.
I'll sleep anywhere.

01:30:01.061 --> 01:30:02.462
All I want is to come back.

01:30:11.905 --> 01:30:13.774
Come here, little guy.

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.481
Jeffrey.

01:30:22.449 --> 01:30:23.616
It's mom.

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:24.485
Open up.

01:30:27.454 --> 01:30:28.454
Jeffrey.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.089
Honey, I need your help.

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.790
I lost my job and I just
need to borrow a little cash.

01:30:31.792 --> 01:30:33.425
- You're strung out.
- No, no, I promise.

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:34.125
I can smell the
drugs all over you.

01:30:34.127 --> 01:30:35.460
No, I'm not.

01:30:35.462 --> 01:30:36.594
I was with some people that use,

01:30:36.596 --> 01:30:38.496
but it's all behind me, I swear.

01:30:38.498 --> 01:30:40.132
Listen honey, I need you.

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:42.034
No, stop it, stop it.

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.939
Listen. I need you to please
show me that you love me.

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.110
Who are you?

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:51.943
- Vanessa.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:51.945 --> 01:30:53.545
I didn't mean interrupt
you. I just...

01:30:53.547 --> 01:30:55.447
Vanessa, what
are you doing here?

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.882
I tried to call you, but
you never answer your phone.

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.517
V, just please go.
I will call you later.

01:30:58.519 --> 01:30:59.852
I know all about
girls like you.

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:00.986
- I shouldn't have come.
- You're in love

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:02.120
with my Jeffrey, aren't you?

01:31:02.122 --> 01:31:03.121
- Stop it.
- No.

01:31:03.123 --> 01:31:04.757
Vanessa, please go.

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.126
Mothers can always
tell these things.

01:31:10.163 --> 01:31:12.031
I just came to
return your sweatshirt

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:14.602
that you left at our
house and here, take it.

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.937
And to tell you that...

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:19.707
All I wanted was
to know you too.

01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:25.076
Vanessa, wait.

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.181
Vanessa.

01:31:28.949 --> 01:31:29.817
Vanessa.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.156
I'll be damned.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.590
You remember Buzz?

01:31:38.592 --> 01:31:40.159
He still takes good care of me.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.826
What the hell
happened to you, kid?

01:31:41.828 --> 01:31:42.995
This is why you want
me to stay outside?

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:43.995
Leave him alone.

01:31:43.997 --> 01:31:45.030
Leave him alone.

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:45.930
He's sick, okay Buzz.

01:31:45.932 --> 01:31:47.532
He's sick.

01:31:47.534 --> 01:31:48.534
Come on, obviously
you could use some help.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.201
Don't touch me.

01:31:50.203 --> 01:31:51.070
Oh my God.

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:52.670
Oh my God.

01:31:52.672 --> 01:31:53.839
God, that son of yours
just broke my nose.

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:54.940
Don't worry about it.

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:55.810
Come on.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.079
Just come on.

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:04.050
Stay away from me.

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:07.221
Buzz, come on. Stop it.

01:32:09.856 --> 01:32:11.223
Be quiet.

01:32:12.659 --> 01:32:15.193
Where do you think you're going?

01:32:15.195 --> 01:32:17.595
I told you what would
happen if you ran away,

01:32:17.597 --> 01:32:19.598
you little faggot.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.535
You owe me.

01:32:21.868 --> 01:32:23.802
I swear to God,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.605
Your mom still
needs you, Jeffy.

01:32:27.641 --> 01:32:30.142
I still have a lot of
customers that'd be into you,

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.811
pretty little face like yours.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.879
You got yourself all worked up.

01:32:34.881 --> 01:32:36.982
You could still make a
good little hooker, I bet.

01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.250
- Oh God, help me.
- I'm gonna take care of you.

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:41.152
Please get off me.

01:32:41.154 --> 01:32:42.556
Please get off.

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:50.696
Oh God, I missed you.

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:53.132
Look what we have here.

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:55.202
You better look out, kid.

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:08.114
Mom.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:20.927
Eric.

01:33:26.199 --> 01:33:27.068
Eric.

01:33:31.104 --> 01:33:31.972
Eric.

01:33:34.774 --> 01:33:35.773
Oh my God, man.

01:33:35.775 --> 01:33:37.742
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:33:37.744 --> 01:33:39.644
I'm so sorry.

01:33:39.646 --> 01:33:42.113
I lost the dog.

01:33:42.115 --> 01:33:43.816
I can't find him.

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:44.849
We will find him.

01:33:44.851 --> 01:33:46.018
I lost the dog.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.018
I lost the dog.

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:47.885
It's okay, man.

01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:49.254
It's okay.

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:51.255
I swear, we'll find him.

01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:52.891
Come on, man.

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:54.026
You can't stay in here
like this, come on.

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.126
I don't know, you know.

01:33:55.128 --> 01:33:57.362
You know I don't know.

01:33:57.364 --> 01:33:58.763
But what is to know?

01:33:58.765 --> 01:34:00.766
Do you know?

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:02.701
- You know-
- Here you go, hun.

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:03.337
Thanks.

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:12.413
I write poems,
did you know that?

01:34:13.713 --> 01:34:15.082
No. Like what?

01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:19.854
Roses are red,
violets are blue.

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:24.358
If you needed a kidney,
I'd give one to you.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:27.328
Funny.

01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:33.667
Here, sign me up.
I'll go up there.

01:34:36.302 --> 01:34:37.438
Wait, are you serious?

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:05.731
I've never done this before,

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.802
but what the hell, right?

01:37:26.306 --> 01:37:28.474
Hi. You're
Jeffrey, right?

01:37:32.145 --> 01:37:33.277
I don't know. I don't know.

01:37:33.279 --> 01:37:35.112
He's not in the apartment.

01:37:35.114 --> 01:37:36.548
I looked like five blocks
away from the house.

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:37.883
I can't find him anywhere.

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:38.953
I don't know where he is.

01:37:40.186 --> 01:37:41.622
I didn't know who else to call.

01:37:47.293 --> 01:37:48.962
Hey, here you go.

01:38:00.039 --> 01:38:01.440
Why did you come back here?

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.141
Yeah, you maybe
have some rough times,

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.110
but you got outta here.

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:06.180
You had a life, man.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:10.551
I had a lie.

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:25.664
Ed.

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:26.999
Yeah.

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:27.501
This is your old camera.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.038
What would it be doing here?

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.311
I thought teaching an art
class to a bunch of people

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:43.214
that didn't have a place
to live was so stupid.

01:38:43.216 --> 01:38:44.585
I was just trying to survive.

01:38:46.619 --> 01:38:48.253
I'm Ed.

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:49.590
That's my daughter, Vanessa.

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:52.459
I knew it was her.

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:54.927
You're hungry?

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.361
Oh, maybe later.

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.562
I teach philosophy.
That's my day job.

01:38:58.564 --> 01:39:00.500
It's either that or
write fortune cookies.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:06.037
Wow.

01:39:06.039 --> 01:39:07.106
Look at this.

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:14.478
Here. Keep capturing
this monumental moment.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.113
I don't know how to use this.

01:39:16.115 --> 01:39:17.984
Experiment. That's
the way to learn.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.254
Always impressed when
I see a photographer

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:26.023
with the bravery to take
a shot up at close range.

01:39:26.025 --> 01:39:27.027
No, no, no. Keep it.

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:29.961
- What?
- No, I want you to have it.

01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:31.631
I have no idea
why he gave it to me

01:39:32.699 --> 01:39:34.233
and I never even thanked him.

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.504
I never intended to lie to them.

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:41.608
It's just somewhere
along the way

01:39:43.176 --> 01:39:45.179
it was nice not having
a history for a change.

01:39:50.016 --> 01:39:50.684
I'm tired.

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:16.743
Jeff.

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.512
Jeff.

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:21.382
Hey, wait.

01:40:36.596 --> 01:40:37.463
Wait.

01:40:38.498 --> 01:40:39.731
Wait.

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:42.168
Jeff, where are you going?

01:40:48.341 --> 01:40:49.208
Stop.

01:40:53.146 --> 01:40:53.814
Stop.

01:40:57.717 --> 01:41:00.384
I've never done this before,

01:41:00.386 --> 01:41:01.587
but what the hell, right?

01:41:04.757 --> 01:41:07.260
Have you ever wondered
on your daily commute

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.695
while you take in the
sights and the smells

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:12.330
of the world around you

01:41:12.332 --> 01:41:13.734
through a tempered glass
and air conditioning,

01:41:15.301 --> 01:41:17.369
if there's less
to life than this?

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:20.371
Less than your job and your
house, your hot girlfriend,

01:41:20.373 --> 01:41:21.673
the sex you're having,

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:24.144
the sex you wish
you were having?

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:28.546
I'm not gonna spew a
courageous story of survival

01:41:28.548 --> 01:41:30.315
to restore anyone's
hope in mankind

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:33.119
'cause it doesn't exist.

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.420
I'm just a bug in a jar

01:41:36.422 --> 01:41:39.391
straining to squeeze my
contorted, splitting flesh

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.561
through a nail-poked
hole in the lid.

01:41:44.597 --> 01:41:48.335
At night, I still see her
emaciated form pleading.

01:41:49.869 --> 01:41:51.535
Her starving body
feeding itself with grief

01:41:51.537 --> 01:41:53.705
as she sobs dry tears
over her lifeless baby

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:55.507
stiffening in her arms.

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:57.108
She's locked her eyes to mine

01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:58.576
and I desperately
seek some callousness

01:41:58.578 --> 01:42:00.812
to force my eyes away,
but everywhere I turn,

01:42:00.814 --> 01:42:03.650
she's there and I curse her.

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.884
Because the shit I've seen

01:42:06.886 --> 01:42:08.320
has burned a hole
so deep inside of me

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:10.354
that everything blurs,

01:42:10.356 --> 01:42:12.391
and the only thing
that I can see clearly

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.759
is some almighty son of a bitch,

01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:18.398
hell bent on making a
sick believer out of me.

01:42:25.204 --> 01:42:27.608
I would love to be an atheist,

01:42:28.908 --> 01:42:31.209
but when you are sitting there

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:33.180
sucking down on your
peppermint latte,

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.185
and she's digging a grave in
the dry dirt for her dead baby,

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.256
I simply can't
escape the obvious

01:42:44.757 --> 01:42:49.395
that somebody up there is
just fucking with all of us.

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:12.719
Where have you been?

01:43:28.801 --> 01:43:29.670
Fuck you.

01:44:35.868 --> 01:44:37.804
You have been so thirsty,

01:44:41.841 --> 01:44:43.876
but your cries are heard.

01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:05.359
Hurry.

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:07.561
Come on.

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:16.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:19.637
Here you go.

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:20.571
- Thank you.
- You okay?

01:46:20.573 --> 01:46:22.374
Yeah.

01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:23.775
You want me to hang around?
I can wait downstairs.

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:25.078
No, you should
be home with Vanna.

01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:28.414
I love you.

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:36.823
Eric.

01:46:37.890 --> 01:46:38.757
It's okay, hey.

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:39.626
It's me.

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:42.396
It's Ed.

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.769
I think this belongs to you.

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:07.953
I'm sorry.

01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:12.492
It's okay.

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:14.694
Son,

01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:19.998
I don't know why
some people suffer

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.469
through drought
longer than others,

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:26.106
but the rain always
comes eventually.

01:47:27.807 --> 01:47:30.942
And when it does, the
desperate, barren, thirsty earth

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:35.513
quenches itself in a way
that the lush, green earth

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:39.017
could never imagine
or understand.

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:42.853
And I have to live
in this tension

01:47:42.855 --> 01:47:45.925
because that is
where the fire is.

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.730
I think he's pooping.

01:49:11.110 --> 01:49:12.610
Hey, hey, hey, slow down.

01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:13.745
Here's your camera, dad.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:14.745
Get anything good, buddy?

01:49:14.747 --> 01:49:16.315
Yeah, a caterpillar.

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.250
Hey, Eric,
you almost done in there?

01:49:19.252 --> 01:49:20.250
Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:27.925
Come
on, help mommy out.

01:49:27.927 --> 01:49:29.928
Grab us some plates.

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:32.229
Mom, do you want
us to feed him?

01:49:32.231 --> 01:49:34.165
No, no,
your brother first.

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:35.098
- Yes.
- No.

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.034
- Yes.
- No.

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.168
- Yes.
- No.

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.769
We caught a caterpillar,

01:49:38.771 --> 01:49:40.204
then it pooped, and then
it fell off the leaf

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.673
and then we took
tons of pictures.

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:43.308
Really?

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:45.175
Walked down the
path, and we had dad's camera

01:49:45.177 --> 01:49:49.147
and we took pictures of
trees and interesting rocks

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.915
and a big fish was in the creek.

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:51.982
Oh wow.
