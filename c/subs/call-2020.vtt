SUNG-HO'S STRAWBERRIES

01:36.221 --> 01:38.389
Hey. Why did you only show up now?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.020
Did you go see your mom at the hospital?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.398
Sung-ho.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.945
Can I borrow your phone?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.200
No answer?

01:58.409 --> 01:59.494
No.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.663
Do you have any idea where you left it?

02:02.413 --> 02:04.666
I think I left it on the train.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.794
You can use mine for the day.
I'm not expecting calls anyway.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.588
It's okay.
I'm sure there's a phone at home.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.674
At home?

02:15.885 --> 02:19.764
This house is still the best one
in the village.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.624
<i>Hello?</i>

03:28.625 --> 03:31.586
Hello. You found this phone, right?

03:31.669 --> 03:32.629
<i>Yes.</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:38.468
I'm the owner of that phone.
Did I leave it on the train?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.094
<i>Yes.</i>

03:42.263 --> 03:44.599
Where are you?
I'll come and pick it up from you.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.560
<i>-Maybe she'll give us some money. Ask her.</i>
<i>-You ask her.</i>

03:48.144 --> 03:49.145
<i>Is there a reward?</i>

03:50.146 --> 03:50.980
Sorry?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.441
<i>This is a Galaxy Note 9, right?</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:55.777
<i>We'll call you back.</i>

03:56.736 --> 03:57.570
Hello?

04:01.324 --> 04:05.203
<i>The number you have called is currently</i>
<i>unavailable. Please leave a message…</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:08.748
<i>The number you have called…</i>

04:09.832 --> 04:11.709
FIND MY DEVICE

04:18.925 --> 04:20.301
LOOKING FOR MY DEVICE

04:22.095 --> 04:23.304
Hello?

04:26.724 --> 04:27.934
<i>You were right.</i>

04:28.559 --> 04:30.395
<i>My mom's insane.</i>

04:31.062 --> 04:33.189
<i>I'm totally locked up in the house.</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:36.234
I'm sorry,
but who were you trying to call?

04:37.735 --> 04:39.153
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee's number?</i>

04:41.656 --> 04:43.574
No, I think you have the wrong number…

04:53.251 --> 04:55.837
Do you see this film
covering the right side of the brain?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.464
This surgery requires us to make
an incision on the skin,

04:58.548 --> 05:02.510
then we must split the skull
in order to remove the tumor.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.971
We can't perform the surgery here.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.141
It's a complicated procedure,
so she'll need to go to a bigger hospital.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.478
A one or two millimeter difference
can lead to a coma or a paralysis.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.653
You're cutting away all the fruit.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
Do you remember Young-mi?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.204
No.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.541
You know,
my friend who works in insurance.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.710
She has fair skin and a high nose bridge.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.712
What about her?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.258
She'll take care of it.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.885
Take care of what?

05:43.968 --> 05:46.054
What do you think? The insurance payout.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.807
It's impossible to save up 100 million won
working at a convenience store.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.311
You should…

05:54.645 --> 05:56.773
go visit Dad's grave tomorrow.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.443
Ask the manager there

06:02.070 --> 06:03.738
if I should be buried beside him,

06:04.238 --> 06:06.199
or if we should be buried together.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.080
Mom, how can you even say that?

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
What?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.004
Do you think you have the right
to be buried next to Dad?

06:22.173 --> 06:23.132
What?

06:23.674 --> 06:25.385
Am I wrong?

06:27.887 --> 06:30.181
You shouldn't talk like that.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.823
Do you still feel like painting your nails
in this situation?

06:55.540 --> 06:58.418
FEBRUARY 24, 1965 – NOVEMBER 27, 1999

07:17.353 --> 07:18.354
Hello?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.732
<i>Sun-hee! I think Mom's trying to kill me.</i>

07:21.816 --> 07:22.692
I'm sorry?

07:22.775 --> 07:27.738
<i>Come over now. You know my address, right?</i>
<i>4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup!</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:31.075
Who are you? You keep calling me.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.703
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee's store?</i>

07:34.495 --> 07:35.913
No, it's not.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.417
<i>Bullshit. Are you doing this on purpose?</i>

07:40.042 --> 07:40.877
What?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.772
22 YEONGCHEON-GIL,

11:43.327 --> 11:45.496
FIRE FLOODING REPELS GHOSTS
BY BURNING THEM

11:45.579 --> 11:48.624
THE PLAGUED BATHROOM SHALL BE BURNT DOWN
IN SECRET AND MOTHER SETS ME ON FIRE

12:08.394 --> 12:09.520
Do you know her?

12:10.604 --> 12:11.856
Young-sook…

12:13.315 --> 12:14.150
Young-sook?

12:18.612 --> 12:20.030
Was she a shaman?

12:21.824 --> 12:25.077
No, not Young-sook. But her mother was.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.789
Did our house used to belong to a shaman?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.083
No, I wouldn't say that.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.044
You just said her mother was a shaman.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.550
Well, that was ages ago.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.136
It was back in the '90s,
so I hardly remember anything.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.306
-But you knew her name--
-Strawberry, what's this?

12:45.389 --> 12:46.599
I told you not to do this.

12:46.682 --> 12:50.186
How many times do I have to tell you?
Come here. Come.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.312
Come here.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.354
Come on! Come here.

SUN-HEE'S STORE

13:41.862 --> 13:44.365
<i>Sun-hee, please come help me! Hurry!</i>

13:44.448 --> 13:45.282
What?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.619
<i>Mom's trying to set me on fire now!</i>

13:48.702 --> 13:50.204
<i>My mom is trying to…</i>

13:53.332 --> 13:54.250
Hello?

14:00.464 --> 14:01.465
<i>Hello?</i>

14:33.289 --> 14:34.665
Give it here.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.460
<i>Hello?</i>

15:24.506 --> 15:26.008
<i>Why didn't you come yesterday?</i>

15:27.426 --> 15:28.802
<i>How can you do this to me?</i>

15:30.095 --> 15:34.350
Is your address really
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.687
<i>Isn't this Sun-hee?</i>

15:41.899 --> 15:43.651
I saw your picture, Ms. Oh Young-sook.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.405
The one that was taken
on November 26, 1999.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.282
<i>What?</i>

15:52.576 --> 15:54.495
But it's the 18th today.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.082
<i>Did you write this</i>
<i>in your diary yesterday?</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:04.213
<i>"New life was born,</i>
<i>and the parents began to oppress again"?</i>

16:16.684 --> 16:18.852
NEW LIFE WAS BORN,
AND THE PARENTS BEGAN TO OPPRESS AGAIN

16:24.441 --> 16:26.151
Are you watching me right now?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.742
<i>This is going to be hard to believe,</i>

16:34.576 --> 16:35.953
but I think…

16:39.164 --> 16:40.874
we're in the same house right now.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.015
I'm sorry.
I must've called the wrong number.

16:56.098 --> 16:56.932
<i>Wait.</i>

16:59.601 --> 17:02.896
NOVEMBER 18, 1999

17:05.274 --> 17:07.860
PLANE CRASHES NEAR GIMPO AIRPORT,
136 PASSENGERS INJURED

17:08.694 --> 17:11.405
There will be a plane crash
near Gimpo Airport tonight.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.211
<i>Pelicana Chicken is here</i>

17:26.295 --> 17:30.340
<i>Delicious chicken is here</i>

17:31.967 --> 17:34.720
<i>I want fried chicken!</i>
<i>I want spicy chicken!</i>

17:34.803 --> 17:36.263
<i>Golly, that looks delicious!</i>

17:36.346 --> 17:37.431
<i>Peli Peli</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:39.892
<i>Pelicana</i>

17:40.809 --> 17:42.102
Hurry up and eat.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.821
Do you want to starve?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.916
Do you call this food? Damn it.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.210
What?

18:08.295 --> 18:10.089
Does this even work?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.887
Do you want to go back
to the mental hospital?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.932
Do you want to end up like your mom?

18:31.985 --> 18:32.986
Oh Young-sook.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.409
Oh Young-sook.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.387
This is happening
because of bad feng shui.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.474
-You'll feel better as soon as we move.
-<i>Breaking news.</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:04.685
<i>There's been a domestic airline accident.</i>

19:04.768 --> 19:07.980

PLANE CRASH AT GIMPO AIRPORT

19:23.203 --> 19:24.246
Hello?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.669
<i>How did you know?</i>

19:40.554 --> 19:42.681
<i>How old are you, Young-sook?</i>

19:46.226 --> 19:48.520
I'm 28.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.900
I'm also 28.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.735
I was…

19:57.487 --> 19:58.488
I was born in 1972.

20:00.115 --> 20:00.949
Oh.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.121
You like Seo Taiji, don't you?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.472
This is Seo Taiji's song?

20:25.182 --> 20:27.684
He'll return from the States
and make a comeback in 2000.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.731
It sounds like him, but…

20:47.537 --> 20:49.915
So there's a computer inside the phone?

20:49.998 --> 20:50.832
<i>Yes.</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:53.919
It's called a smartphone.
You can do almost anything with it.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.338
<i>What about music?</i>

20:57.297 --> 20:58.382
Do you have Walkmans?

21:00.509 --> 21:01.468
"Walkmans"?

21:01.551 --> 21:02.552
Yes.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.722
Don't you know what they are?

21:05.806 --> 21:07.015
<i>They play music.</i>

21:07.099 --> 21:08.183
Oh, music?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.685
Of course you can.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.147
You can take pictures, watch movies,
and even shop on your phone.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.525
Sounds like you're lying to me.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.820
<i>I can understand. When I was young,</i>

21:19.903 --> 21:22.614
I never imagined
we'd be able to make video calls.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.573
<i>Video calls?</i>

21:24.866 --> 21:27.661
Yes, you can see the other person
while talking on the phone.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.454
That's possible?

21:31.206 --> 21:32.666
Are you curious about anything else?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.004
I wonder what I'll be like.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.759
Oh, good question.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.220
You want me to find out?

21:45.721 --> 21:46.555
OH YOUNG

21:46.638 --> 21:47.472
<i>No.</i>

21:51.351 --> 21:53.937
Why not?
Finding you would be a piece of cake.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.482
My mom told me
that I'm cursed with a wretched fortune.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.237
<i>She said I was born</i>
<i>with a brutal, atrocious fate.</i>

22:04.448 --> 22:05.782
<i>Anyway, she's crazy.</i>

22:06.283 --> 22:08.869
<i>She locks me up at home</i>
<i>and doesn't let me see anyone.</i>

22:10.412 --> 22:13.081
Do you not get along with your mother?

22:13.582 --> 22:14.416
<i>With my mom?</i>

22:14.499 --> 22:16.043
That woman is not my real mom.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.462
My real mom is dead.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.426
I'm sorry.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.677
<i>Why are you sorry?</i>

22:25.761 --> 22:27.095
It's not like you killed her.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.434
Actually, I also lost my dad
when I was young.

22:33.060 --> 22:33.894
<i>Really?</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:36.355
<i>How?</i>

22:36.438 --> 22:38.231
There was a fire at our place.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.942
My mom forgot to turn off the gas valve.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.205
Hey, Young-sook.

22:54.164 --> 22:54.998
Yes?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.627
<i>What did you say the date was over there?</i>

23:08.178 --> 23:09.888
Seo-yeon, I think my mom's coming.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.932
<i>I'll call you back in a bit.</i>

23:12.015 --> 23:13.100
Hey, wait.

23:49.719 --> 23:53.557
NOVEMBER 21, 1999

24:09.614 --> 24:10.657
We're here!

24:11.741 --> 24:13.410
Wow! Chickens!

24:14.494 --> 24:17.080
Hey, be careful. Don't run.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.792
What a nice house! Isn't the air so clean?

24:22.711 --> 24:26.089
A missionary used to live here.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.301
It's a luxurious mansion,
which is hard to come by in this area.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.635
I see.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.555
You shouldn't touch that.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.559
It's a nice location with good feng shui.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.686
You know what our elders always say.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.772
You've got to live on a good lot
to improve your health and wealth.

24:44.107 --> 24:47.277
You said it's about 100 pyeong
both floors combined, right?

24:47.360 --> 24:48.361
That's right.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.905
It's pretty big.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.657
Oh, they have fish.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.284
Hey, don't run.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.078
Look, it's spacious enough
for your kid to run around.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.417
Could we see upstairs too?

25:22.395 --> 25:23.313
Seo-yeon.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.066
Seo-yeon?

25:27.442 --> 25:30.529
Stop poking around in someone else's home.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.368
What's that room for?

25:38.370 --> 25:39.913
That's my daughter's room.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.168
Just a moment.

25:54.928 --> 25:55.762
Open the door.

26:02.102 --> 26:02.936
Hello.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.359
Dad.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.152
That girl is scary.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.195
Seo-yeon.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.117
I'm so sorry.
She's too young to know better.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.169
Is your name Seo-yeon?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.180
Hello?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.725
<i>Hey! Wake up. Now!</i>

26:42.225 --> 26:44.227

26:47.522 --> 26:49.816
<i>I guess you're planning</i>
<i>to run a farm or something?</i>

26:49.899 --> 26:53.361
<i>Yes. We want to live</i>
<i>in a quiet and peaceful place now.</i>

26:53.862 --> 26:56.573
<i>And it'd be nice for my daughter</i>
<i>to grow up close to nature.</i>

26:56.656 --> 26:59.868
<i>Oh, yeah? This is the best place for that.</i>

27:00.785 --> 27:02.704
<i>I'm thinking of starting a flower farm.</i>

27:03.288 --> 27:06.082
<i>Well, it won't be easy</i>

27:10.545 --> 27:11.713
<i>Yes, I sure am.</i>

27:11.796 --> 27:14.007
Dad, come on. Chickens.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.759
All right, let's go.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.011
-Did you see them in the yard?
-Yes.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.596
When did you see them?

27:24.851 --> 27:25.769
Did you hear them?

27:26.519 --> 27:27.562
What do you think?

27:29.731 --> 27:30.690

27:42.160 --> 27:43.161

27:46.998 --> 27:50.752
You know what? I have a fun idea.

Look. It's a frog.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.656
He probably snuck in
since it's cold outside.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.574
How adorable.

33:54.657 --> 33:58.536
He has such grumpy eyes.
He looks just like you.

These look especially good.

51:30.962 --> 51:32.172
-Wash these.
-These are for you.

51:32.255 --> 51:33.965
-Strawberries spoil fast.
-I'll do it.

51:34.049 --> 51:34.883
No, it's fine.

-Sure. Let's do that.

Is it a special day?

51:56.947 --> 51:57.864
Do I look pretty?

52:08.416 --> 52:10.210
I brought some strawberries.

52:10.710 --> 52:12.003
Strawberries?

52:54.171 --> 52:56.173
This one or this one?

52:57.257 --> 52:59.176
I'm not sure. They both look good.

53:00.343 --> 53:02.470
I don't know much about these things.

53:02.554 --> 53:03.430
Really?

53:05.182 --> 53:06.266
Hold on.

53:48.558 --> 53:49.392
What is this?

53:59.402 --> 54:01.279
Why did you open that?

54:02.530 --> 54:03.657

54:21.424 --> 54:23.843
I don't care for marriage.
I'm fine being single.

54:25.053 --> 54:27.973
You should still get married.
Aren't you lonely?

54:28.056 --> 54:30.684
No, I don't feel lonely at all.

54:34.020 --> 54:36.731
Bark, bark. Is that so?

54:40.902 --> 54:41.736

54:59.170 --> 55:02.090
<i>Shit. I just bought these clothes.</i>

55:07.512 --> 55:08.888
What was that?

55:26.448 --> 55:27.657
Did Sung-ho leave?

55:29.826 --> 55:30.660
Who?

55:30.744 --> 55:31.578

56:38.019 --> 56:39.854
The strawberry farm
beside the green tea field.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.358
A strawberry farm?
Did we ever have one around here?

56:45.235 --> 56:46.111
What about it?

56:46.903 --> 56:47.737
Pardon?

56:48.988 --> 56:51.032
Why are you looking for someone
who died ages ago?

56:52.283 --> 56:53.535
What do you mean he died?

I see.

58:20.830 --> 58:21.706
All right.

58:24.417 --> 58:25.627
Aren't those strawberries?

58:27.128 --> 58:29.964
Mr. Park was handing them out
to his neighbors yesterday.

58:32.509 --> 58:33.343
Oh.

58:35.970 --> 58:36.846
You're right.

58:44.103 --> 58:45.688
I guess my mom got them from him.

When will she be back?

58:59.118 --> 58:59.953
Not sure.

59:00.036 --> 59:01.663
She went somewhere far.

59:02.664 --> 59:03.706
When did she leave?

59:04.541 --> 59:05.375
Two days ago.

59:05.458 --> 59:07.001
MOM, OUT, TWO DAYS AGO

59:07.627 --> 59:09.337
Didn't your mother get those yesterday?

59:12.757 --> 59:16.636
Right. It must've been yesterday then.

59:25.019 --> 59:26.145
YESTERDAY

59:28.356 --> 59:30.567
BAEK MIN-HYUN

59:33.861 --> 59:36.155
I guess there was a murder in the village.

59:39.367 --> 59:40.535
Did someone die?

59:49.127 --> 59:50.420
Welcome.

59:50.920 --> 59:51.921
Hello.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.173
Hello. What are you looking for?

59:54.674 --> 59:56.009
Well…

59:58.344 --> 1:00:00.805
Do you happen to know
someone named Oh Young-sook?

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:12.317
<i>I thought she was a good-natured girl.</i>

1:00:14.402 --> 1:00:17.030
She'd listen to me
complain about my alcoholic dad,

1:00:17.113 --> 1:00:21.034
and I'd sometimes sneak her snacks.

1:00:32.295 --> 1:00:34.130
If it wasn't for her mom…

1:00:35.340 --> 1:00:36.924
I'd be dead now.

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:51.689
<i>It's me.</i>

1:00:53.358 --> 1:00:55.568
I have something to ask you.

1:00:56.069 --> 1:00:57.236
Was it you?

1:01:00.114 --> 1:01:00.990
What?

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:03.326
Your mom and Sung-ho.

1:01:05.453 --> 1:01:06.537
Did you kill them?

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:20.176
What are you talking about?

1:01:27.975 --> 1:01:31.437
"Serial killer Oh Young-sook
sentenced to life imprisonment."

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:37.985
Life imprisonment?

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:45.576
So it really was you.

1:01:47.328 --> 1:01:50.415
Are you saying I'll rot in jail
for the rest of my fucking life?

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:53.793
<i>But I finally feel like I'm alive.</i>

1:01:57.004 --> 1:01:58.798
How can you say that right now?

1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.137
How did the cops figure it out?

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:08.725
Sung-ho didn't even do anything wrong.

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:16.941
Find out what kind of evidence
the police found.

1:02:22.572 --> 1:02:24.240
You didn't forget, did you?

1:02:25.950 --> 1:02:27.410
I saved your dad.

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:53.311
<i>You fucking bitch.</i>

1:02:54.562 --> 1:02:58.191
How dare you hang up on me, fucker?

1:02:59.692 --> 1:03:02.153
Did you forget
that I saved your dad's life, you bitch?

1:03:02.236 --> 1:03:04.697
I ask you to help me,
and this is what you fucking do?

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:06.616
Hey!

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:09.702
<i>Where did you learn</i>
<i>to be so ungrateful, you bitch?</i>

1:03:12.955 --> 1:03:13.873
Hello?

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:17.752
Hello?

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:22.048
Fuck.

1:03:25.802 --> 1:03:27.553

Oh, you're home.

1:05:40.186 --> 1:05:42.730
We were waiting
for your mother to show up.

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:46.317
We were supposed to meet her
at the realtor's office at 11.

1:05:47.151 --> 1:05:49.070
-Oh.
-Is she not at home?

1:05:54.116 --> 1:05:55.201
Mom!

1:05:58.537 --> 1:05:59.664
Mom!

1:06:06.504 --> 1:06:08.547
I think she fell asleep.

1:06:10.257 --> 1:06:11.550
You can wait inside.

1:06:14.512 --> 1:06:15.429
Come wait inside.

1:06:29.151 --> 1:06:30.111
Seo-yeon.

1:06:31.570 --> 1:06:32.530
Yes?

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:34.115
Did something happen?

1:06:35.408 --> 1:06:37.201
No, of course not.

1:06:49.338 --> 1:06:50.214
Get out.

1:06:50.297 --> 1:06:51.257
Why?

1:06:52.758 --> 1:06:53.801
Just get out.

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:57.346
Wow!

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:00.057
Stay put.

1:07:00.766 --> 1:07:01.600
Okay.

1:07:02.935 --> 1:07:03.894
Hey, strawberries!

1:07:12.403 --> 1:07:14.113
Jeez! Hey.

1:07:14.196 --> 1:07:16.198
Don't step on it so briskly.

1:07:16.282 --> 1:07:19.410
Relax your foot and just tilt your ankle.

1:07:26.876 --> 1:07:29.587
If you don't spill the coffee
when you brake, you pass.

1:07:38.137 --> 1:07:39.346
Is the strawberry good?

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:53.694
Hey, you're a good driver.

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.154
Can you see?

1:07:56.572 --> 1:07:59.742
You should have a good view
of the rear window. Yes, that's it.

1:08:08.667 --> 1:08:09.502
Dad.

1:08:15.132 --> 1:08:16.050
Dad?

1:08:23.015 --> 1:08:24.350

1:08:24.433 --> 1:08:25.768

Dad!

1:08:57.758 --> 1:08:58.759
No!

1:09:43.679 --> 1:09:45.514
It's your fault
for not picking up the phone.

1:09:49.351 --> 1:09:50.227
Right?

1:09:51.812 --> 1:09:53.898
Look at the mess you've made.

1:11:05.177 --> 1:11:06.011

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:08.013
Jeez. You're finally picking up.

1:11:08.639 --> 1:11:10.933
Why is it so hard to get through?

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:13.894
What did you do to my dad?

1:11:14.853 --> 1:11:18.065
<i>I warned you not to disconnect the phone.</i>

1:11:20.359 --> 1:11:21.235
What?

1:11:21.735 --> 1:11:22.987
Do you know what?

1:11:24.238 --> 1:11:26.824
Chickens still run around
even after their heads are cut off.

1:11:27.783 --> 1:11:29.410
<i>Your dad was kind of like that.</i>

1:11:29.910 --> 1:11:31.412
You fucking bitch!

1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:36.000
Fuck you.
I'm going to find you and kill you.

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:38.210
I'll kill you
just like how you killed him!

1:11:38.294 --> 1:11:39.128

1:11:39.628 --> 1:11:41.088
How do you plan on doing that?

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:43.799
You can't even come here.

1:11:45.592 --> 1:11:48.262
<i>Wait, no.</i>

1:11:48.887 --> 1:11:50.597
You're already here.

1:11:51.974 --> 1:11:53.183
With me.

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:57.563
I'll give you an hour.

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:02.067
Find out exactly how
the police will arrest me.

1:12:11.243 --> 1:12:12.328
Oh, right.

1:12:14.747 --> 1:12:19.251
Now that I think about it,
didn't you say you hate your mom too?

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:25.090

Hey, Young-sook. I…

1:21:17.914 --> 1:21:20.458
I wonder if you'll be able
to hear this over the phone.

1:21:20.959 --> 1:21:21.793
Tell me, okay?

1:21:30.594 --> 1:21:31.803
Oh Young-sook.

Young-sook, listen to me. Please?

1:21:35.891 --> 1:21:38.894
Fuck! Just listen to me, bitch!

1:21:39.561 --> 1:21:44.357
My mom told me that peach wood
is very good for warding off evil spirits.

1:21:45.066 --> 1:21:46.776
Hey! Fuck…

1:21:47.986 --> 1:21:51.281
I think you're possessed by the devil
that makes you lie.

1:21:51.364 --> 1:21:53.992
She didn't do anything wrong.

1:21:56.161 --> 1:21:57.913

<i>Why won't you pick up your phone?</i>

1:22:55.762 --> 1:22:58.056

1:23:18.410 --> 1:23:20.453
<i>I'm sure you're dying to know.</i>

1:23:24.332 --> 1:23:30.088
I thought very hard
whether I should tell you this or not,

1:23:32.716 --> 1:23:34.884
but I think you should know.

1:23:38.805 --> 1:23:40.432
<i>You know how your dad died in a fire?</i>

1:23:47.063 --> 1:23:48.440
It wasn't your mom's fault.

Oh, you.

1:24:04.622 --> 1:24:06.708
<i>What did I tell you to do</i>
<i>when you turn on the gas?</i>

1:24:06.791 --> 1:24:07.959
<i>Keep your face away.</i>

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:10.462
<i>That's right.Let's turn it on.</i>

<i>You know, I'm an expert in this field.</i>

1:24:25.226 --> 1:24:26.811
Aren't you a pathological liar?

1:24:28.313 --> 1:24:30.523
<i>I mean, I know you hated your mom, but…</i>

1:24:33.151 --> 1:24:34.569

but it can change a person's life.

Hello?

1:29:28.279 --> 1:29:29.614
The phone.

1:30:01.521 --> 1:30:04.023
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1:30:07.068 --> 1:30:08.319
What time did they leave?

1:30:10.154 --> 1:30:11.447
I'm not sure.

1:30:13.157 --> 1:30:14.742
Maybe around noon?

1:30:21.124 --> 1:30:22.959
This is my daughter's.

1:30:55.283 --> 1:30:57.994
Can we check upstairs too?

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:01.831
Sure. Go ahead.

1:31:19.974 --> 1:31:20.933
Check over there.

1:32:23.371 --> 1:32:24.664
I don't think she's here.

1:32:30.545 --> 1:32:33.965
Let me try calling my husband again.

1:32:38.928 --> 1:32:41.013
I'm sorry, but could we use your phone?

1:32:41.097 --> 1:32:41.931
The phone?

1:32:42.014 --> 1:32:42.848
Yes.

1:32:43.891 --> 1:32:45.268
It's broken.

1:32:50.022 --> 1:32:51.107
It sounds fine.

1:32:51.732 --> 1:32:54.485
She says it works. Let's lower the volume.

<i>Mom, get out of that house right now.</i>

1:33:26.267 --> 1:33:29.186
Oh Young-sook will kill you!
Get out right now!

1:33:29.270 --> 1:33:30.229
Hello?

1:33:31.230 --> 1:33:32.732
-Was it your husband?
-No.

1:33:33.899 --> 1:33:35.526
Some woman picked up.

1:33:36.193 --> 1:33:37.236
What woman?

1:33:38.195 --> 1:33:41.073
She called me Mom,

1:33:42.992 --> 1:33:45.077
and told me to get out
of this house at once.

1:33:45.161 --> 1:33:46.454
I'm sorry?

1:33:58.924 --> 1:34:00.217
Give me the phone.

1:34:06.015 --> 1:34:07.391
What's the matter with you?

1:34:09.769 --> 1:34:12.772
Didn't you want your mom dead?

1:34:20.237 --> 1:34:22.365
You don't have to tell me. I already know.

1:34:26.619 --> 1:34:28.120
Because you and I are alike.

1:35:11.497 --> 1:35:12.665
You bitch!

1:36:16.979 --> 1:36:18.647
Hey! Open the door!

1:36:18.731 --> 1:36:20.232
Open up, damn it!

1:36:40.044 --> 1:36:43.214
I'm calling from
4, Yeongcheon-ri, Bosung-eup.

1:36:43.297 --> 1:36:46.217
<i>She's trying to get</i>
<i>into this room, please…</i>

1:36:46.300 --> 1:36:47.134
Mom?

1:36:48.511 --> 1:36:50.221
Are you okay, Mom?

1:36:50.304 --> 1:36:51.555
<i>She's holding a knife.</i>

1:36:51.639 --> 1:36:53.766
Why are you still there?

1:36:53.849 --> 1:36:55.267
Please hurry!

1:37:00.481 --> 1:37:03.442
Mom, you need to calm down.

1:37:05.653 --> 1:37:07.988
Do you see anything in the room
you can use as a weapon?

1:37:09.198 --> 1:37:11.826
<i>Anything sharp</i>
<i>or heavy enough to strike her with?</i>

1:37:14.495 --> 1:37:16.288
I see a fire extinguisher.

1:37:16.372 --> 1:37:17.832
<i>Hurry up and grab it.</i>

1:37:20.626 --> 1:37:21.877
Stay focused!

1:37:23.337 --> 1:37:24.964
<i>Grab the fire extinguisher, now!</i>

1:37:31.887 --> 1:37:35.432
Remove the safety pin and wait.

1:37:37.184 --> 1:37:39.645
Spray it at her face
when she opens the door.

1:37:54.118 --> 1:37:55.452
Help!

1:37:58.289 --> 1:37:59.707

-Seo-yeon, it's okay.

1:38:29.361 --> 1:38:32.156
It's okay, sweetie.
Mom's here, so you're safe now.

1:38:40.039 --> 1:38:41.665
Mom, answer me.

Gosh, do you know how many times
I called you?

Jeez.

Why are you crying?

1:43:14.271 --> 1:43:15.105
What's wrong?

1:43:18.108 --> 1:43:20.569
Oh, dear. Why are you dressed like this?

1:43:21.945 --> 1:43:23.488
Goodness gracious.

1:43:23.989 --> 1:43:28.243
I still have to feed you and dress you.

1:43:28.327 --> 1:43:30.787
Isn't it chilly?
You'll catch a cold dressed like this.

1:43:31.788 --> 1:43:33.665
My goodness, your hands are ice-cold.

1:43:34.499 --> 1:43:36.043
What am I gonna do with you?

1:43:39.421 --> 1:43:42.841
If your dad saw you,
he'd say you're still a baby.
