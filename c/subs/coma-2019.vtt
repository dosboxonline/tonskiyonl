04:12.900 --> 04:14.440
Sorry, something is happening here ...

04:15.320 --> 04:16.360
What the ...

07:00.070 --> 07:01.240
He is!

07:02.610 --> 07:05.070
Help him up! Why are you so weak damn

07:06.030 --> 07:08.490
Pilot, take him to the stairs! - Come on!

07:38.360 --> 07:39.400
Hurry!

07:43.990 --> 07:45.190
Move your feet!

07:45.400 --> 07:47.030
He's still dazed from the explosion!

08:11.070 --> 08:13.240
Damn link, it's impossible to understand.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.400
Come on!

08:15.110 --> 08:16.070
Hurry!

08:17.150 --> 08:18.780
Just follow us, okay?

08:25.780 --> 08:27.110
Come on, jump!

09:04.150 --> 09:05.110
Hurry!

09:17.780 --> 09:19.110
Away from here!

09:44.190 --> 09:45.440
Come on.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.440
That’s it.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.400
We are done.

09:56.610 --> 09:58.780
I told you. I said it!

10:10.360 --> 10:11.320
Not!

10:28.400 --> 10:30.110
We have no more time!

10:33.240 --> 10:34.440
Get out of here!

10:35.740 --> 10:37.610
I can't take care of you

11:01.990 --> 11:02.940
Wait!

11:04.030 --> 11:05.490
Who the hell are you?

11:07.490 --> 11:08.740
Where are we going?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.820
Do you want to stay?

11:46.110 --> 11:48.780
What happened to me - How do I know?

11:49.570 --> 11:51.690
A car accident or maybe an overdose.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.490
Am I dead?

11:55.070 --> 11:56.150
In a coma.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.780
Is it all just a dream?

11:59.780 --> 12:00.860
Memories.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.990
From whom? - Of all who are in a coma.

12:05.990 --> 12:09.190
Everyone who is in a coma comes to the same place, here.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
Our brain creates a field full of memories.

12:11.610 --> 12:14.150
It switches off in a coma and adapts to this field.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.030
Like the way a radio receives a signal. Look!

12:19.110 --> 12:23.860
Buildings, things, people ... Everything we remember is here.

12:24.070 --> 12:26.570
What we do not remember does not exist here.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.820
So there you have it.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.070
Memories.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.940
That makes no sense.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.360
What about the people who ...

13:00.570 --> 13:03.280
They are not people. I told you these are memories.

13:03.490 --> 13:07.070
Okay, are these black creatures memories too?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.240
Stop!

13:11.440 --> 13:12.400
Hold still.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.780
Soldier Fly!

13:28.820 --> 13:31.610
Are you protecting the environment or should I do it?

13:31.820 --> 13:33.030
I've already.

13:33.530 --> 13:35.150
Then do it again.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.440
Where are we going anyway?

14:04.690 --> 14:06.820
Can it fly? - Get on board!

14:22.900 --> 14:24.570
That is a hole. It happens sometimes.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.650
One of them has the bus on the building, the other in the field.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.570
The memories mix.

14:38.650 --> 14:40.570
Where is he? Where's pilot

14:43.440 --> 14:45.530
He had to distract the Reaper with a pipe.

14:45.740 --> 14:47.440
Otherwise we would not have escaped.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.190
You have ... you allowed that?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.900
Didn't I tell you how dangerous this district is?

14:56.110 --> 14:57.690
And this card was nonsense.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.530
It wasn't enough time. I said you rushed me!

15:00.740 --> 15:03.650
Everything changed there. - Why did we have to go there at all?

15:08.690 --> 15:10.530
I am absolutely sure

15:12.440 --> 15:13.990
that it was worth it.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.400
Fly, lead him around.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.740
He should make himself comfortable upstairs.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.240
Let's go.

15:32.070 --> 15:33.900
The show is over. Get to work!

15:34.110 --> 15:37.990
Tank, what about the path? Are you waiting for the reaper

15:38.190 --> 15:41.150
Finally blow him up! - But we're running out of explosives.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.150
We have to ration. - Ration on the ass!

15:43.360 --> 15:45.440
Haven't you seen how they can jump?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.940
We break all the paths that arise around the building.

15:53.150 --> 15:56.150
But someone always remembers them and they come back up.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.530
To stop the Reaper, we need to be on high alert.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.150
We take turns keeping watch.

16:03.070 --> 16:06.610
Yan says there is an entire island without a reaper in a coma.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.360
We are always looking for people who can help us find them.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.650
For some reason, he's very safe with you.

16:13.860 --> 16:16.940
You have to eat and drink here. Hunger and cold are memories,

16:17.150 --> 16:20.320
but everything here is like reality, so we have to go outside.

16:20.530 --> 16:22.940
Those from the group with special skills go there.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.650
I don't remember my name. - Nobody does that.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.240
Better give yourself a nickname before someone else does.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.690
It is just a dream. - Let's go.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.070
Waking up in a room ...

16:34.030 --> 16:36.740
someone just died to save you.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.570
You can't just wake up. Do you understand that?

16:39.780 --> 16:43.190
Your body is in a coma there. You are here. You can't change that.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.650
And what is that?

17:02.030 --> 17:02.990
Dreams.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.150
They arise when we sleep.

17:06.569 --> 17:09.109
So we can remember something from reality.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.030
You get used to it.

17:13.530 --> 17:17.690
Gnome lives there, Tank, then Spirit, Link, me and Phantom.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.650
The rest live below. Tank gives you clothes and ammunition.

17:20.859 --> 17:22.900
Are you and phantom together?

17:23.490 --> 17:24.530
What?

17:35.860 --> 17:36.820
It is empty.

17:38.110 --> 17:40.940
Spend a few weeks here and it will take shape.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.150
This is yours. Go inside.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.360
Usually a newbie has to go through an initiation rite,

17:50.570 --> 17:53.150
but Yan has decided to take you on the team immediately.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.440
Ah, the man on the balcony. Is he the leader?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.440
It has been here the longest of all.

18:01.030 --> 18:04.570
He woke up from the coma once. That's why we know what this world is like.

18:04.780 --> 18:08.530
He showed us how to survive here. We owe our life to him.

18:08.740 --> 18:10.240
Including you.

18:12.820 --> 18:13.780
Rest.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.280
Tomorrow we'll see what you can do,

18:21.530 --> 18:23.320
Phantom and I are not together.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.820
I didn't want to ... - Even if he thinks so.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.440
It's not like that.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.030
THERE IS A WAY OUT!

20:41.820 --> 20:43.740
You seem to be really a phenomenon.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.570
Don't even think about going there.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.940
Dreams are tricky. You can get lost in it.

20:53.030 --> 20:55.030
You can't get out of there.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.900
So how are you? Do you get used to it well?

20:58.940 --> 21:00.990
I guess so. - Do not rip me off.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.320
Everyone is going crazy in here.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.400
Listen. I was a little strict with you earlier.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.610
No offense, okay? - Yes everything allright.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.030
Peace?

21:17.740 --> 21:18.690
Peace.

21:20.030 --> 21:20.990
You know,

21:22.280 --> 21:25.150
Yan is trying to find this island.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.610
He points out some chosen ones.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.150
It's actually none of my business. I am not against it.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.400
There are people I have to take care of.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.820
Discipline, submission ...

21:37.360 --> 21:39.030
I understand. All right.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.690
Great.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.030
I liked you from the start.

21:46.860 --> 21:48.650
You are smarter than the others.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.690
So stay away from my girl.

21:52.530 --> 21:53.650
I like her.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.150
She plays something up.

21:57.990 --> 22:00.900
But that's okay. We are almost there.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.150
I wouldn't say that.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.650
Yan may see something in you.

22:13.110 --> 22:16.990
But he has made mistakes in the past.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.860
And again:

22:22.070 --> 22:23.860
I lead the team.

22:24.490 --> 22:25.690
Not him.

22:26.610 --> 22:29.900
We should be friends and you are rude.

22:30.690 --> 22:33.650
No, I just wanted to say that she should decide for herself.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.820
You haven't got it yet.

22:43.030 --> 22:44.570
Stand up. - Why?

22:48.780 --> 22:50.070
Get up, soldier!

22:52.240 --> 22:53.190
Quickly!

22:54.280 --> 22:57.320
Everyone is tired of waiting for you.

23:16.030 --> 23:19.320
In a coma, some people develop special, unique skills.

23:19.530 --> 23:23.610
It all depends on their way of thinking and their inclinations.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.490
Spirit, for example,

23:25.690 --> 23:29.070
can feel Reaper from afar and summons the spirits.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.150
Link draws the routes.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.740
Pilot can locate living people in a coma.

23:33.940 --> 23:37.440
To discover his ability, you need a little push.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.490
You have to be put in danger.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.990
Let's see why you are so special.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.820
Gnome, light a half.

24:23.570 --> 24:25.490
Hey Pull yourself together!

24:25.690 --> 24:26.940
Do something!

24:42.360 --> 24:43.940
So far, so bad.

24:45.650 --> 24:50.740
But you know, skills often thrive in real combat.

24:50.940 --> 24:53.400
Out there. For example, it was with me.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.530
But we are not animals that immediately expose you to a real fight.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.940
Gnome built me ​​...

25:01.070 --> 25:02.860
a training machine.

25:03.070 --> 25:04.490
Bring the doll here, gnome!

25:10.650 --> 25:12.240
I said bring her here!

26:00.900 --> 26:02.860
That is an enemy! Attack!

26:10.110 --> 26:11.320
Fight!

26:13.610 --> 26:15.780
Fight! You can do it!

26:48.190 --> 26:49.940
So you can't do anything?

26:59.900 --> 27:01.900
What did you work as?

27:02.650 --> 27:04.780
I think I was an architect.

27:06.490 --> 27:07.610
Cable!

27:07.820 --> 27:09.610
Take care of the beginner.

27:10.530 --> 27:12.570
We didn't have an architect yet.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.320
THERE IS A WAY OUT!

28:27.240 --> 28:29.860
Afternoon shift! Wake up!

28:30.570 --> 28:33.900
Afternoon shift! Let's go to work!

28:56.860 --> 28:58.190
Higher!

28:59.190 --> 29:01.360
Okay, tie it up.

29:07.490 --> 29:11.530
Cable, we go to your submarine and get the explosives.

29:11.740 --> 29:14.440
Seems we have clarified everything here. Get ready.

29:14.650 --> 29:16.110
Yes, commander!

29:19.610 --> 29:21.820
Nice to continue working, architect.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.610
We don't need parasites.

29:41.940 --> 29:44.320
Stop sitting around! Who else should work?

29:47.530 --> 29:49.150
Why are you angry?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.820
You should be glad you idiot. You're lucky!

29:53.190 --> 29:54.690
Why am I lucky?

29:56.820 --> 30:00.440
You may not have valuable super powers, so what?

30:01.070 --> 30:02.190
Look here.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.110
Many of us have failed this test.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.240
We were wrong.

30:08.860 --> 30:11.240
At least we don't have to go outside.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.240
It's safer here!

30:14.900 --> 30:16.280
Live your life!

30:16.820 --> 30:22.150
And you will wake up from the coma and continue on your way.

30:24.570 --> 30:26.740
But you will have to wait a while.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.820
Time passes differently here.

30:31.490 --> 30:34.360
We don't know exactly yet, but it seems ...

30:34.990 --> 30:37.400
not less than 1 in 100.

30:38.610 --> 30:41.240
A day in reality corresponds to many months in a coma.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.860
I have been here for 15 years and you can live here for up to 1000 years.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.650
The question is:

30:48.900 --> 30:51.070
how do you want to spend these 1000 years?

30:51.280 --> 30:54.070
You saved me. Tell me what my job is here

30:54.740 --> 30:55.940
It is not important.

30:56.530 --> 30:59.240
You have to decide yourself who you want to be.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.570
You can drag iron parts all your life

31:01.780 --> 31:04.280
or develop your skills.

31:04.490 --> 31:05.740
But sometimes ...

31:06.360 --> 31:10.190
Sometimes real skills are not recognized immediately.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.820
A person may then have the feeling that he is failing.

31:16.280 --> 31:20.780
I think I built this building in the city,

31:20.990 --> 31:22.610
but I don't know how.

31:22.820 --> 31:25.900
I tried to build something here, but it didn't work.

31:30.030 --> 31:32.030
Phantom didn't lie.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.070
Skills can develop out there.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.320
We don't let newcomers out, it's too dangerous.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.610
But it is your decision. In his case ...

31:43.440 --> 31:44.820
it worked:

31:45.690 --> 31:47.940
superhuman strength, speed ...

31:48.150 --> 31:49.740
He became the leader here.

31:49.940 --> 31:51.940
I've seen a lot of people get through here.

31:52.150 --> 31:54.650
And I think we're here for a reason.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.280
Everyone who is here has not made it in reality.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.400
They had no future there.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.570
I can hardly remember anything.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.440
Just a few scraps.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.650
Maybe it's the best.

32:10.860 --> 32:11.990
How so?

32:12.190 --> 32:15.650
Without the burden of memories, we can start from scratch here.

32:16.650 --> 32:19.400
Nobody except you can say who you are.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.570
This world was created from our thoughts.

32:23.530 --> 32:25.570
The rules are a little different here.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.610
And here, unlike in reality,

32:29.320 --> 32:31.610
you can achieve what you want.

32:38.740 --> 32:42.530
But that doesn't mean you don't have to do anything.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.690
The rear sight and front sight do not move, right?

32:48.900 --> 32:51.320
Yes. - Get your palm closer.

32:53.820 --> 32:54.990
What do you want?

32:55.820 --> 32:57.150
I go with you.

32:57.740 --> 33:00.820
What? Do you want to join us?

33:01.030 --> 33:02.360
Take it with you!

33:05.490 --> 33:06.740
Why, damn it?

33:07.190 --> 33:08.990
Because I said it.

33:10.860 --> 33:12.440
He will die.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.070
Than it's so.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.440
We have enough people to haul iron.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.320
Let's see.

33:25.150 --> 33:26.740
Already understood, thanks.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.190
Excuse me, can someone give me a gun?

34:39.610 --> 34:41.900
There is Gnome's tunnel. We go there.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.780
Yes, there is my tunnel.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.739
Sorry, but why is it "Gnomes Tunnel"?

34:51.940 --> 34:54.070
Because I remember it.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.820
And I remember that beauty that we'll see soon.

34:58.030 --> 35:00.190
This world is made up of memories.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.900
Sometimes it's easy to find out who they belong to.

35:03.110 --> 35:05.320
Link has a complete theory about it.

35:05.530 --> 35:07.190
Ask him. It is crazy.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.740
Tell me, Link.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.240
I heard you have many. - Dreams?

35:12.440 --> 35:14.400
Yes, in your room. - Oh well.

35:15.990 --> 35:19.440
Because the coma separates our consciousness from our body,

35:19.650 --> 35:21.650
we lose our memories here.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.150
We lose ourselves. Okay?

35:24.690 --> 35:26.900
So ... - But in our dreams

35:27.110 --> 35:30.940
there is all the information about what we remembered in life.

35:31.150 --> 35:35.150
Even the place where we are now exists there.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.900
You can find yourself dreaming there.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.690
So can you wake up from a coma this way?

35:40.900 --> 35:42.530
What are you talking about?

35:42.740 --> 35:44.070
Yan said it:

35:44.280 --> 35:46.490
If you try to enter dreams, you won't make it.

35:46.690 --> 35:49.610
What's so hard to understand? - It does not mean that it is impossible.

35:49.820 --> 35:51.240
Who asked you

35:51.440 --> 35:52.440
Reaper!

36:00.030 --> 36:02.320
No no no. It is save.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.530
It's a two-day trip from there.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.900
Can you see us - You can feel us.

36:10.110 --> 36:12.860
We give a signal, a frequency.

36:14.030 --> 36:16.240
That's why I built the pipe. - What pipe?

36:16.440 --> 36:19.440
So that we don't all fly in the air.

36:19.650 --> 36:21.610
But only one. - As with pilot.

36:21.820 --> 36:25.030
You activate the pipe and that distracts the Reaper.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.150
Then you blow yourself up with dynamite.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.990
If this world is made of memories,

36:33.190 --> 36:34.440
where do they come from?

36:34.650 --> 36:35.690
From us.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.740
How?

36:42.610 --> 36:43.860
Coma patients.

36:44.690 --> 36:48.280
Your brain is dead, but the life-supporting devices are still running.

36:48.490 --> 36:50.610
The relatives don't want to switch it off.

36:50.820 --> 36:53.030
The dead brain creates them.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.150
They die ...

36:56.030 --> 36:58.070
and crumble all the time.

36:59.110 --> 37:02.070
But they can transform the living into the same black substance that

37:02.280 --> 37:03.650
they are made of.

37:03.860 --> 37:06.070
Better switch off the machines than end up like this.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.990
Doesn't look like that! Let's go!

37:21.690 --> 37:23.780
There is our main attraction!

37:37.360 --> 37:40.030
Architect, did you bring clean underpants?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.690
Yes, they're pretty gun-fired with their weapons.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.150
Who? - The guards.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.820
Memories. - Why should they shoot us?

37:47.030 --> 37:50.190
You shoot strangers. That's how I remembered.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.820
Okay, take that.

37:52.650 --> 37:55.990
Turn here and your bio signal will be amplified.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.650
It attracts the reapers like honey the bees.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.400
Roger that. - Do not worry. There are no reapers here.

38:03.030 --> 38:06.240
But don't give it a shit for no reason. - Link, you are so boring!

38:06.440 --> 38:09.360
We're more likely to die of boredom than of the Reaper.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.650
Enough! I'll go ahead!

38:12.440 --> 38:14.360
Tank, stay behind me and cover me.

38:14.570 --> 38:16.860
Spirit, distract them.

38:17.650 --> 38:18.940
The rest are holding back.

38:19.150 --> 38:21.190
Stay behind, for your own safety.

38:21.990 --> 38:24.150
Any questions? No questions.

38:24.650 --> 38:25.690
Let's start!

38:44.150 --> 38:45.150
Freeze!

39:17.740 --> 39:19.400
Did you work here

39:19.610 --> 39:22.280
What kind of place is it - A mix of many factories.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.360
Shared memories from many people.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.530
There!

39:26.190 --> 39:27.360
There is the barn!

39:27.570 --> 39:30.440
I remember again! There is a secret door there.

39:31.490 --> 39:33.150
You are going away.

39:33.780 --> 39:36.530
We have 30 seconds to get in there.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.320
Not yet, phantom! Phantom!

39:50.190 --> 39:51.150
Come on!

40:13.280 --> 40:15.030
Come on! - Stand still!

40:26.860 --> 40:28.820
Tank, throw a grenade!

40:29.030 --> 40:31.900
It's too far, I can't do it! - You can do it! Throw!

41:02.820 --> 41:03.990
Tank!

41:04.190 --> 41:05.820
Cover me!

41:07.650 --> 41:09.240
Stay back, tank!

42:03.400 --> 42:04.360
Get down!

42:11.860 --> 42:12.820
Spirit!

42:28.190 --> 42:29.150
Here ...

43:17.400 --> 43:19.690
What the hell was that?

43:20.650 --> 43:22.360
You still kill us all!

43:24.900 --> 43:26.490
What do you know?

43:28.150 --> 43:31.610
Quiet. - We summoned the Reaper!

43:32.650 --> 43:34.900
Spirit? - I can't feel it yet.

43:40.110 --> 43:41.070
Do you see?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.690
Nothing is happening to you.

43:49.190 --> 43:52.110
If you ever yell at me again,

43:52.320 --> 43:53.940
I'll make little wood out of you.

43:55.690 --> 43:57.690
I'm in charge here!

43:59.780 --> 44:01.780
Do you disagree?

44:01.990 --> 44:03.690
I can not hear you!

44:08.990 --> 44:09.940
Yup!

44:10.400 --> 44:11.940
I did it!

44:16.900 --> 44:18.110
Are you all right?

44:35.860 --> 44:38.490
I certainly don't remember that.

44:44.360 --> 44:47.900
Each torpedo is equipped with explosives. That'll be enough for a month.

44:48.740 --> 44:49.780
Get to work.

44:50.990 --> 44:52.150
At it.

44:59.690 --> 45:01.240
Come on, come on!

45:01.740 --> 45:03.820
Come on! Quiet, calm!

45:05.400 --> 45:06.610
Calm!

45:06.820 --> 45:09.900
Slower! Come on, come on.

45:19.400 --> 45:20.900
Let me heal that

45:22.110 --> 45:23.110
There is nothing.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.740
Come on. I want to look at your hand too.

45:26.570 --> 45:28.150
I said it's nothing!

45:33.860 --> 45:34.820
Thanks.

45:36.570 --> 45:37.530
Attention!

45:38.280 --> 45:40.070
Attention! Hold tight!

45:41.240 --> 45:45.150
Just a slight wiggle and everything blows up!

45:52.070 --> 45:53.490
Damn coma !!

45:54.940 --> 45:56.530
I recognize this here.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.280
Any country.

45:59.150 --> 46:01.610
But I can't remember which one.

46:12.940 --> 46:13.900
What's happening?

46:19.610 --> 46:21.820
All of this is like a dream, isn't it?

46:24.320 --> 46:25.490
A dream.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.440
You think you understand ...

46:39.070 --> 46:41.530
Reaper! - I told you.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.030
How far?

46:46.490 --> 46:48.940
Maybe 500 meters! - Get them down!

46:49.780 --> 46:51.190
I can not!

46:52.190 --> 46:53.940
I need another minute!

46:54.150 --> 46:56.320
Get down now! - I said one minute!

46:56.530 --> 46:57.860
Damn commander!

46:58.400 --> 47:00.780
I'll finish this alone. - Okay.

47:15.150 --> 47:18.400
He won't make it. - Are you happy now?

47:26.190 --> 47:28.820
Hold that as long as you can. Roger that?

47:32.320 --> 47:34.280
Gnome stays here, the rest follow me!

47:34.490 --> 47:37.240
He can't do it alone! - Cable is up there!

47:37.440 --> 47:39.900
No discussion, follow the command!

47:40.110 --> 47:42.570
On three: one, two,

47:43.150 --> 47:44.530
three. Run!

47:55.280 --> 47:56.990
Stop! Stands still!

48:05.820 --> 48:07.610
I said you should wait!

48:08.400 --> 48:09.360
Run!

48:11.360 --> 48:12.400
Come back!

48:12.990 --> 48:14.860
Come on! - Come back!

48:20.320 --> 48:21.400
Come back now!

48:38.610 --> 48:39.570
Wanker!

48:41.240 --> 48:42.240
Don't you dare!

49:09.610 --> 49:11.110
Take him to the exit.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.530
Come on!

49:43.320 --> 49:44.280
So,

49:44.490 --> 49:46.990
I look down, you're all running,

49:47.190 --> 49:49.440
the stupid thing starts sliding down and pulls me with it.

49:49.650 --> 49:53.320
As I crouch on it, I think, "That's it."

49:53.530 --> 49:56.900
But then sparks fly and this carrier ... boom!

49:57.530 --> 50:02.280
My first thought was: "I'm dead, it exploded."

50:02.490 --> 50:06.110
Who knows what it is like to die in a coma.

50:06.320 --> 50:10.070
Architect, you idiot! Why didn't you run with the others?

50:10.280 --> 50:11.690
This was an order.

50:14.490 --> 50:16.280
It makes me think ...

50:28.400 --> 50:29.360
that is,

50:29.570 --> 50:32.530
can you create a wall during a fight?

50:33.690 --> 50:34.690
Yes.

50:36.820 --> 50:38.900
Maybe a bridge too?

50:42.530 --> 50:44.280
I guess a bridge too.

50:51.780 --> 50:52.860
Great!

50:54.650 --> 50:56.740
You will be very useful for the team, architect!

50:59.030 --> 51:02.400
We'll get to places we never even thought of before.

51:02.610 --> 51:03.740
And I think

51:05.360 --> 51:08.530
there's a better way to use your skills.

51:12.110 --> 51:15.490
We searched for a hiding place from the reapers for a long time.

51:15.690 --> 51:17.070
An isolated place.

51:17.690 --> 51:20.820
But we couldn't, because people don't just remember a place,

51:21.030 --> 51:24.190
they also remember how to get there.

51:25.400 --> 51:26.860
That's right, Link.

51:27.650 --> 51:32.280
But what if a place

51:32.490 --> 51:34.650
arises not from memories but from imagination?

51:34.860 --> 51:36.440
When will it be created?

51:36.650 --> 51:39.860
Built like this carrier from which Cable fell.

51:40.690 --> 51:44.320
Then it is not intertwined with other memories.

51:44.990 --> 51:46.610
And that's why it's safe.

51:49.110 --> 51:50.650
I told you

51:50.860 --> 51:53.190
that I will bring you to this island.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.650
And he will create them for us.

52:02.490 --> 52:04.990
Do you think he can do it? An entire island?

52:07.360 --> 52:08.650
Can you do that?

52:18.860 --> 52:19.820
Yes.

52:20.650 --> 52:22.070
I can do it.

52:25.610 --> 52:28.070
Now is the best time to go.

52:29.860 --> 52:32.490
Yan, don't you want to discuss this with me first?

52:33.070 --> 52:36.440
We need time to prepare. - Link, what do you think?

52:38.530 --> 52:42.360
If we leave with the civilians,

52:42.570 --> 52:45.190
we have to choose the safest route.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.610
And we haven't had one like this for a long time. - Hey, theorist!

52:49.820 --> 52:52.280
It's all on paper, Yan. - Didn't we get everything ...

52:52.490 --> 52:54.990
explosives from the area?

52:55.190 --> 52:58.030
Where should we go when all is used up?

52:58.240 --> 53:00.320
Sooner or later the Reaper ... will

53:00.530 --> 53:03.070
see people through the bus. So what?

53:03.280 --> 53:04.900
We're leaving tomorrow.

53:06.610 --> 53:08.650
Link will lead the team.

53:15.110 --> 53:16.070
Yan.

53:16.280 --> 53:19.860
Yan, I may have gone too far today, but ...

53:20.070 --> 53:21.990
You were ruthless.

53:23.690 --> 53:26.780
You put the Reaper on. - That was not agreed.

53:27.780 --> 53:29.490
This is my place!

53:31.990 --> 53:33.740
The mission is too important.

53:35.490 --> 53:36.780
Important mission?

53:37.690 --> 53:40.360
Maybe they deserve to learn a little more?

53:40.570 --> 53:42.110
We talk about this later!

54:05.320 --> 54:06.940
Why don't we drink?

54:13.150 --> 54:16.570
Tomorrow is an important day. Isn't it an architect?

54:58.860 --> 55:00.360
Damn it!

55:00.860 --> 55:02.110
What are you doing there?

55:02.740 --> 55:05.650
You scared me. Nothing, I'm just trying something.

55:08.860 --> 55:10.190
To create something?

55:11.400 --> 55:12.780
Well, I'm trying.

55:15.190 --> 55:16.400
May I watch?

55:16.780 --> 55:18.940
I'm almost done.

55:23.030 --> 55:24.360
Doesn't it work?

55:26.190 --> 55:27.860
No, not in the slightest.

55:30.690 --> 55:33.990
Why did you tell everyone you were going to create this island?

55:40.030 --> 55:42.690
At the submarine, you yelled at everyone to come back.

55:42.900 --> 55:45.240
You weren't sure if it would work.

55:46.150 --> 55:47.440
You could have killed everyone.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.490
But it worked.

55:51.690 --> 55:55.110
So far you have managed without me. - Find out what went wrong.

55:55.320 --> 55:56.990
Wait! You were focused.

55:57.190 --> 55:59.490
You did something with your hands and then something appeared.

55:59.690 --> 56:02.240
Yes, this carrier has appeared. What are you saying that for now?

56:02.440 --> 56:04.400
No, the design has surfaced.

56:15.190 --> 56:17.150
The design has surfaced.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.280
The design has surfaced.

56:22.610 --> 56:25.860
Yes. I have to imagine the complete blueprint.

56:26.690 --> 56:28.650
The complete blueprint.

56:58.070 --> 57:00.740
So which city should I build for you on my island?

57:31.610 --> 57:34.610
They say you have a lot of memories in your room.

57:35.570 --> 57:36.650
Oh well.

57:37.280 --> 57:39.150
I want to see her. Are you showing them to me

57:45.400 --> 57:48.610
How many there are. I have almost none.

57:48.820 --> 57:50.940
That means you don't remember anything?

57:51.150 --> 57:52.400
Just a feeling.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.110
Did you have a car accident?

57:55.320 --> 57:58.320
Yes, I was on my way to an important meeting

57:59.110 --> 58:01.110
but it turned out to be a trap.

58:01.940 --> 58:03.400
An architect trap?

58:03.610 --> 58:05.490
Yes, admittedly, that sounds crazy.

58:09.240 --> 58:11.190
And this woman? Were you close?

58:11.400 --> 58:14.030
I don't remember, and it doesn't matter anymore.

58:14.240 --> 58:17.320
My life is here now. - But you wanted to wake up so much.

58:17.530 --> 58:20.400
Yes, yes, I know. But ...

58:22.690 --> 58:26.360
here I met you and here I can become myself.

58:26.570 --> 58:28.320
I think Yan is right.

58:28.530 --> 58:32.110
If we don't remember anything, we can start a new life.

58:35.400 --> 58:38.030
And to be who we always wanted to be.

58:38.240 --> 58:40.150
Sounds stupid, doesn't it? - No.

58:44.440 --> 58:45.990
I see that too.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.400
Then you remember something.

58:50.990 --> 58:51.940
I do.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.940
I couldn't be with who I wanted to be with.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.740
And here I can.

59:48.110 --> 59:51.740
During the mission, everyone should strictly follow the leader.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.860
Do not deviate, keep your distance.

59:55.070 --> 59:58.110
Do we get weapons? - You don't need weapons.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.650
There are no reactors on this route.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.570
This is where we build an island.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.650
We go through the mountains.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.070
You won't even notice us.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.570
What if you missed one of them?

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.820
I know them all. I've considered everyone. Spirit?

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:17.530
Seems to be right. I usually feel it ...

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.940
Phantom, listen.

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.280
Shall we take these explosive safety wires with us?

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.740
Link leads the team.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.320
He is now the commander. - Okay I got it.

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.780
So, I have a question: What should I build on this island?

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:01.740
You are the architect, it is up to you. - There is a project. It's not mine,

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.110
and the customer wouldn't be happy if I borrowed it.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.400
Oh, I think you can send him to hell now.

01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:11.190
Well ... - I don't know what the project is,

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.070
but you, architect, should build my own hut for me.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.150
With a workshop, you know? - And with a whirlpool for me!

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.320
A shooting range for me! - Okay, come on down!

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.240
Forms a snake.

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:26.240
Reaper!

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.320
That's impossible.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.610
I checked everything! Are you sure?

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.150
I only say what I feel. - Damn it.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.360
It's always the same with the reapers.

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:53.610
With so much ballast, we won't make it far, if at all.

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:55.570
Shall we turn back?

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:01.990
We won't get that chance again so quickly. It depends on you.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.570
Phantom.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.150
You have more experience. What do you think?

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.400
We should split up, check all directions,

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.690
then come back here and choose a new route.

01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:19.030
Reasonable.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.360
Two should stay to protect the others.

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:25.190
The architect and I stay. - He won't be able to help you.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:29.740
He cannot shoot and is inexperienced. You'd better stay here with a tank.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.190
Or I stay if you want. - No.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.940
Nothing will happen to him!

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:35.940
We're just peeking, but there are a lot of civilians here.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.400
No!

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.320
I can do it. Is okay.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:45.990
Tank stays here. Architect, go up this hill.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.860
If you see a plane, come back right away, understand?

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.190
The rest go in the respective directions. Swarm out!

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.240
Tank, what are you doing here

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:28.360
Yan sent me. As if he sensed it.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.490
Hurry!

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.650
Reaper! About 300 meters away!

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.070
Let's go!

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.150
What ... - Give me that!

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.190
What do you do? - I said give it to me!

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.400
Let go!

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.940
Let him go!

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.570
Where did you get that?

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:11.820
You cheered him on! - You set us all up!

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.070
I did not want. We have to go.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.070
Hey Wait!

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.320
It's not what you think. You are not in the picture.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.940
It's ... He's the one who ...

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.400
We have to get out. We all have to get out of here immediately.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.940
Reaper!

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.110
Link, lead everyone out of here!

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:56.780
Listen everyone! Get rid of the heavy equipment!

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:02.900
Cable!

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:08.190
On your right!

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.400
We're leaving!

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:31.740
Architect! To the bus! Hurry! Link, take it with you!

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:41.609
You reacted to the Reaper pipe. - Behind you!

01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:43.899
That’s it, folks.

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:46.109
There!

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:57.149
Architect!

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.900
THERE IS A WAY OUT!

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:25.400
We are nearly there.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.030
Did you get a prepayment? - What prepayment?

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.490
Do not you see? Unlike other idiots, they accepted me

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.780
and my projects! - Clear. They think you are cool

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:38.570
and your projects great, and that's it? Have you lost your mind

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.190
Are you watching TV? Do you have any idea what they're saying about your customers?

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.610
They only use you, they won't pay you.

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.780
Or worse, I don't know.

01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:01.690
Read what the teacher says about you! - Damn it!

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.990
The way to a new life will open up for you!

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.780
Is that him? - I dont know.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.820
You don't know what he looks like? - We only spoke once.

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.990
Be quiet!

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.820
It was said that you would come alone.

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.360
But he's not alone. - Chill out!

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.650
We can only let you in on your own.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.690
I'm very sorry, we have strict rules.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.150
Are you the customer? - Oh, no, of course not.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.780
I am just a simple assistant.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.900
It was I who sent you the offer.

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:44.150
The teacher is waiting for you inside.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.490
You won't ... - Please, wait for me here.

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:49.860
Wait. - What?

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:51.570
Here, take this with you.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:04.240
What is that? A hospital?

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.190
A former. We just took it over.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.990
Brilliant. How long have you had this idea?

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.110
Since university.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.440
And people just keep building these ugly structures.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.530
Yes, you are absolutely right, it is crazy.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.360
I sent them around to various competitions, but ...

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:55.650
pointless, it's just pointless. Pearls before swine.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.360
This world could never see anything unusual

01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:01.440
even if it were a hundred times better.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.030
Would you really be able to build what I suggest?

01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:09.990
Follow me, I'll show you something.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.320
Excuse me, but what exactly is your organization doing?

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:27.490
You know, there are many rumors.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.110
We give people the light of new life.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.780
You saw the board.

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:37.530
You will see it yourself.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.150
I studied the cerebral physiology of the brain

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.940
and discovered that people who are in a deep coma have

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:56.610
access to a whole world that nobody knows about.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.440
This world is so much better than the known reality.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.610
Do you mean dreams?

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.650
It is impossible to explain. Do you want to see it?

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:07.940
I'm in a hurry, I still have to do something.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.690
It will not take long.

01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:13.190
I am sure you will like it.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.110
Let go! Stay away from me!

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:35.190
What happened? - Go ahead! Get going!

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.990
I ran over someone!

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.740
Drive! - I told you they were lying!

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.690
Why don't you listen to me Why don't you ever listen to me

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.690
She was in a coma just a few hours ahead of you.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.110
But months have passed there.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.900
Fascinating, isn't it?

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.110
Who the hell are you?

01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:37.530
A group of scientists who

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.650
want to give people a new world.

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.940
And what about these spiritual teachings?

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:46.860
They help finance the project.

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:50.940
My studies were announced unsuccessfully, so I had to find a way.

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:54.940
And a wise man said, "If you want to get rich

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.860
, start your own religion."

01:15:57.070 --> 01:16:00.440
Incidentally, it was much easier than I thought.

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:04.070
So is my city project a lie? - Of course not!

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:06.900
The city is real.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:11.280
I put together a group of people

01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.990
with special brain pathologies that

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:16.280
can survive in a coma.

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.110
I found an artist

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320
with amazing memory and imagination

01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:22.900
so that he could work on a worthy project

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.690
and realize it there.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:25.990
But for what?

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.650
Do not you understand? To be able to live there.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.860
In dreams?

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:36.820
The coma world was known to people long before our time.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.150
Old rulers from many cultures went there.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.440
But modern technology

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.110
paved them with the walking corpses, the reapers.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.070
And all these people found a new meaning, a new life.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.570
Even you were almost happy there.

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.030
There you were the great architect.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.320
And what is waiting for you here?

01:16:58.530 --> 01:16:59.990
Country houses.

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.780
If you are lucky.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.400
Did you get the same injection as me?

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:08.860
It is faster and better for them.

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:10.990
You should have asked her first!

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.990
You know, Phantom's memory was completely restored.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.990
He remembered how he got here and who he was.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.440
But he didn't want to wake up.

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:28.610
A reaper caught him later.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:32.150
At the physiological level, this is necrosis of the brain tissue.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.240
He panicked and threatened to tell everyone the truth.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.900
In the end, he killed a lot of people and ruined almost everything.

01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:41.740
It took a lot of effort to get you out of there.

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.280
So, the more you know, the more problems arise.

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:51.610
And will you put all of your followers into a coma?

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.860
You need people to create a new life.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.440
Slaves.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:58.940
But you won't know you're going to be in a coma, will you?

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.490
In return, I will give people infinite life full of meaning.

01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:03.900
What's wrong with it?

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:06.400
Everyone can have what they want in a coma.

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:09.570
One has the task of being a commander or spiritual leader,

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:11.900
the other a great architect.

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:15.360
You are crazy! Don't you understand that these are all just dreams?

01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.240
That does not matter. See ...

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.940
that's it, I'm out of here. Let us go. Please, it's enough.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.070
Knowledge is the source of all problems.

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:33.280
You will still achieve what is necessary.

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.740
I'm not going there again.

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.780
You know, if the Reaper catches someone,

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.360
their brain dies in a matter of minutes.

01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:48.650
Did you leave her in a field?

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.440
Strange. At the moment everything looks normal.

01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:55.570
But it is impossible to see everything. - That's enough!

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:58.360
Let her go, she has nothing to do with it!

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:01.820
I invited you alone. You caused the accident.

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:04.530
You did this to yourself. You too.

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:08.360
Anyway, you will build this island and your city on it,

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.530
then I will let you both go.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.570
You will let us all go!

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.940
I give you my word that I won't stop anyone.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.820
You will wake up in your house again.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.940
Your brain captures the strongest memories.

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:50.150
This time, your memory will recover much faster.

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:52.320
You have to find link.

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:55.070
The coordinates for the city you are supposed to build are on his map.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.990
What if I can't reach him?

01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:58.280
You'll.

01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:03.440
This stimulation makes your brain work much more intensely.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.690
Sure, it harms your health,

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.070
but you'll be a superhero for a while.

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:13.150
Moment. How will they know we have to get out of the coma?

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.440
Not at all.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:18.780
So yes, there is a way. From the inside out.

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:21.570
A back door, if you will.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.110
When you've done everything, I'll show you.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.240
Think about it. I came out too.

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:29.070
Now sleep.

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.070
Get down!

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.190
That's it, that's the last one!

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.780
Leave it to us.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.820
Yes ...

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.860
It's not what you think.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.150
We have to go.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.690
As quickly as possible.

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.070
Many people don't accept it in the beginning.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.740
Maybe we should give him time.

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:00.650
No.

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:03.900
Do what i say

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.360
Here it is.

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:29.030
Yan chose this location himself.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.320
He said he's majestic.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.820
What's happening?

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.860
Did you hurt yourself

01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:41.650
It's nothing, I'm just exhausted.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.990
I will live on this island for some time.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.320
Very soon.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.030
I can not believe it.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.690
Yan was right after all. - Don't you understand that?

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.570
We are all in the basement of this madman!

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.320
This island will not exist, it is just a dream!

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.150
I know it's difficult to understand.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.240
But if you see with your own eyes how you are lying there ...

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.570
So you really told them.

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:17.150
You've been through so much, that's not fair.

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:20.360
Where should i build

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.360
The bridge should start right here.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:38.280
"And God looked at everything he had done,

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.740
and behold, it was very good."

01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:42.820
What do you need reality for now?

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.780
Yan, I built everything. Let's go.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.360
Spirit.

01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:03.650
In your life you saw dead people around you

01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:07.570
and had several seizures a day.

01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:11.940
You had no relatives and you lost your only child.

01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:17.320
I saved you from the institution where you would have rotted to your death.

01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:19.610
Tank.

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.610
You lost your family in an accident.

01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.070
You became an angry alcoholic.

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.440
Started shooting at your neighbors.

01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:29.820
You would have ended up in a mental asylum

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.440
or in prison.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.440
Link, you are autistic.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.780
You can't even go out.

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:40.490
Your poor old parents.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.070
What will happen if they die?

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.990
And you have an even more serious illness, architect.

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:54.400
Your ideas are beautiful, but they're too futuristic.

01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:58.280
That means that nobody needs them. Everyone left you, even she who was

01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:02.150
by your side until the end. He's nothing out there.

01:28:02.690 --> 01:28:04.610
A childish, undetected genius who

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.900
takes out all his anger around the world.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.400
I bet you thought of suicide

01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:15.610
long before you got that envelope.

01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:22.860
This project has given you meaning in your life again.

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.900
Did you get a prepayment? - What prepayment?

01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:35.110
Do not you see? Unlike other idiots, they accepted me

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.030
and my projects!

01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:41.780
Just keep laughing. After that everything will change for us, I'm sure.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.940
For us? There is no "us".

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.940
That's why you're sitting here in this car.

01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:48.240
My goodness!

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:53.360
They think you're cool and your projects are great, and that's it?

01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:56.740
Have you lost your mind - You once believed in me more.

01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.150
They only use you, they won't pay you.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.820
Or worse, I don't know. - Do you have a guilty conscience?

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.820
It's a great car. It is certainly a gift

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:10.190
considering that you are only a nurse. But okay.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.280
I'll buy you a new one when I'm famous.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.360
This is the last time that I help you.

01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:25.150
We stay.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.650
Stay here.

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.070
But now I won't leave you anymore.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.940
I can not. You would give up everything.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.940
And who should believe us? - My followers.

01:29:57.650 --> 01:29:59.530
You can't hide that forever.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.650
And there is no place in heaven for those who

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.280
know the secret of its creation.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.150
That affects you too.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.900
Now that you know everything, I can no longer let you live with the others.

01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:13.740
We won't tell anyone.

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.360
It's over.

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.780
You suffer out there.

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:27.030
The lack of oxygen in the brain has started

01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.190
and you will soon feel it.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.530
AIR SUPPLY INTERRUPTED

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:39.530
I don't know in what order you were turned off.

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:43.530
It's seconds there, but here we have about 15 minutes

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.400
to say goodbye.

01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.740
Wait!

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400
I was a little unsure.

01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:01.740
Stimulating the brain can be harmful,

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.150
but in this case it was worth it.

01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:07.280
I have a lot to do.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.360
Damn it!

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.940
You warned me that they would only use me!

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.610
What? - We have to wake up.

01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:41.740
We'll wake up and switch it off.

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.030
The back door!

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:44.780
Link!

01:31:47.150 --> 01:31:50.360
How did he get out when the Reaper attacked? - Dreams.

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:53.570
Each of us has dreams WHERE we are right now.

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:55.990
If you find yourself in that dream, then ...

01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:59.150
That's why he said that dreams are dangerous!

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.650
You are dangerous! It's not that easy! - We do not have much time! Link, let's go!

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.070
Spirit, let's go!

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:49.780
INTERRUPTED AIR SUPPLY

01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:01.530
Come on

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:04.150
Link, we have to go to Yan's room. Go ahead

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.110
You are already there.

01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:16.440
We can't do it! - Crap.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.240
I have an idea!

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.280
Come on! More quickly!

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.360
THERE IS A WAY OUT

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.990
What is? - I don't remember that.

01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:08.650
These are dreams, I told you that.

01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:12.780
We have to work harder to find this place, everything is mixed up here!

01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:16.070
Then there, I think.

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.070
There was a door and stairs. That is not the same!

01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:28.570
Link?

01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:31.900
Everything in here is connected by association.

01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:34.690
Try not to look for the layout of the rooms.

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.070
How does it work?

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:38.900
Details!

01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:42.860
Look for details that remind you of this room!

01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:44.610
One detail ...

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.610
yes, here it is.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.650
That was a painting from the room.

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.820
Right!

01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.530
I was right!

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.650
Of course you were right.

01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:25.650
Despite everything, Link is a genius. Where would we be without him?

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:29.280
Memory always has the most interesting things for us.

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.690
And of all things, you remember a temple in this picture.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.030
A true architect.

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.610
You know, I really hoped that you were smarter than the rest.

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.360
You reminded me of myself when I was young.

01:37:49.150 --> 01:37:50.400
Medicine continues to struggle to

01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:52.820
extend a human life by five years,

01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:55.070
but I can extend it by a thousand years.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.530
And you know what?

01:37:57.150 --> 01:37:59.190
My department was closed to

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.570
fund the development of a new cellulite remedy.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.530
I never understood how to live in such a stupid

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.360
and ugly world,

01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:11.820
but then I realized it: there is another world.

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:13.900
I discovered it.

01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:21.150
Run!

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.490
But I had my doubts, just like you.

01:38:26.690 --> 01:38:28.780
It's just an illusion.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.240
I thought so until I made a discovery.

01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:34.690
Everything we live for,

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:40.320
all our emotions, joy, happiness, anger, amazement, sadness

01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:43.990
are just electrical impulses from our brains.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.860
We measured them in reality and in a coma.

01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:49.440
And do you know what?

01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:51.900
They were absolutely identical.

01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:56.360
Life in a coma is as real as it can be.

01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.490
That's the way it is.

01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:02.070
It's that simple.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.150
We found it, Fly.

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.320
INTERRUPTED AIR SUPPLY

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.570
Come on!

01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:12.740
Come on!

01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:14.940
Calm.

01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:20.280
Calm.

01:42:20.490 --> 01:42:22.190
Breathe.

01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:24.610
Breathe.

01:42:25.190 --> 01:42:28.400
Breathe. Calm.

01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:51.240
What ...

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.780
we're going home.

01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:16.440
Everything will be fine. We're going home, okay?

01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:19.110
We go. Stand up.

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.740
So, I'm almost done, but I need a break.

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.440
Let's go for a walk with Torik.

01:44:34.650 --> 01:44:36.240
All right, let's go.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.240
What about your projects Did someone answer?

01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:40.780
No.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.490
This is definitely due to the wrong presentation.

01:44:44.690 --> 01:44:47.650
Come on, no, everything's great. You just have to be realistic.

01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:50.610
My projects are really worthless. But at least ...

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.690
will be financially better this year. We won the tender.

01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:57.530
Is that a joke? - No.

01:44:59.110 --> 01:45:00.610
Congratulations.

01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:03.820
It looks like the scandal about the "Foundation of Eternal Life"

01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:05.900
will end without results.

01:45:06.110 --> 01:45:10.490
All charges have been dropped for lack of evidence

01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:12.110
since it was found

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.440
that all subjects were legally accommodated.

01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:21.030
The organization continues to successfully recruit its followers ...

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.860
A BRILLIANT, NEW LIFE

01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:31.110
IS A WAY OUT

01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:35.400
Do you think they will come to us?

01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:37.940
We have nothing to fear. Get dressed.

01:45:53.490 --> 01:45:56.530
By the way, the post came in the morning. An envelope addressed to you.

01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.530
Yes I saw it. - What is inside?

01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:08.440
Nothing special, just documents for an old project.
