00:05.296 --> 00:05.505
.

00:05.547 --> 00:06.297
- Morning, my little retreads.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.592
Good news, bad news.

00:09.634 --> 00:13.346
Good news, you all passed
the power and range test,

00:13.388 --> 00:16.599
so you're one step
away from reinstatement

00:16.641 --> 00:18.518
in Chicago's finest.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.730
Bad news, you need to requalify

00:21.771 --> 00:24.566
in all current laws, rules,
and regs.

00:24.607 --> 00:29.195
You pass this test,
and you're back to full duty.

00:29.237 --> 00:33.158
Officer..."Russ-ek."

00:33.199 --> 00:35.660
Am I boring you?

00:35.702 --> 00:38.079
- No, Officer. No.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.165
- Now, where were you assigned

00:40.206 --> 00:43.793
when you had
your little misstep?

00:43.835 --> 00:46.129
- Intelligence.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.173
- Well, let's hope
you've got some.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.091
Good luck.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.427
- Thanks.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.722
[apprehensive music]

00:55.764 --> 01:02.812
* *

01:03.229 --> 01:06.149
[muttering under breath]

01:28.171 --> 01:30.924
[crunching]

01:30.965 --> 01:37.847
* *

01:42.727 --> 01:43.687
[sighs]

01:48.108 --> 01:51.277
[sirens wailing]

02:00.995 --> 02:02.747
[clears throat]

02:05.041 --> 02:06.292
- Did she get him?
- Mm-mm.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.711
Well, she turns to me,
and she goes,

02:07.752 --> 02:10.296
"Kim, there's a scary dog
in the backyard.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.715
We have to find another way."

02:11.756 --> 02:12.966
So I go and I look.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.426
Guess what kind of dog it was.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.469
- A pit bull?
- A chihuahua.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.388
It was the size of a football.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.306
I mean, it was growling,
but it was making a little...

02:20.348 --> 02:22.183
[high-pitched barking]

02:22.225 --> 02:23.643
- Police aren't
releasing names,

02:23.685 --> 02:25.562
but we can confirm
two have been arrested

02:25.603 --> 02:27.147
and two offenders are wanted.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.690
Chicago Police are on site.

02:28.732 --> 02:35.697
* *

02:49.210 --> 02:51.129
- Hey, sorry.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.589
- Hold'em with the boys again?

02:52.630 --> 02:55.508
- [sighs] Last minute game
at the cop bar.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.348
- It's all good.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.142
Just remember,
no river, no fish.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
- You got it.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.937
Get some sleep.
- Okay.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.359
[door clicks]

03:12.400 --> 03:15.320
[mellow music playing
over radio]

03:15.362 --> 03:22.494
* *

03:26.373 --> 03:28.208
- Tick, tock, AJ.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.584
Two Gs to you.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.711
- I heard you
the first five times, Wes.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.422
- Yeah, come on.
Let the man think, all right?

03:35.590 --> 03:38.677
On you.
Can you grab me another beer?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.390
- You know what, boys?

03:43.431 --> 03:44.432
I'm all in.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.435
[tense music]

03:47.477 --> 03:51.815
* *

03:51.856 --> 03:53.900
- Same.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.779
- [exhales]
Lotta money on the table.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.411
Oh, it just got real.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.249
Here we go.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.709
All right.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.043
Oh, God.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.921
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.464
Whoo!

04:16.506 --> 04:18.216
- All in? Dude.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.467
Two-eight off suit.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.760
You're crazy, AJ.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.345
- I'm not crazy.
I'm just alive, Zaco.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.222
Now, give me a snowman, baby.
Come on.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.807
All right.
Put down that eight.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.105
[laughs]
Ask and you shall receive.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.274
- All right. All right. Hey.
[Ruzek claps]

04:34.315 --> 04:36.568
All right.
1 in 42 odds. 1 in 42.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.861
You're a dead man walking.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.446
- All right,
just put the card down.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.239
- I'll try.
- [chuckles]

04:41.281 --> 04:45.452
* *

04:45.493 --> 04:49.289
- [laughing]
[indistinct chatter]

04:49.330 --> 04:50.540
- Come on, bro.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.666
- Is that a full house?
- Yep. Yep.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.959
- Is that a full house?

04:53.001 --> 04:54.627
Winner, winner, chicken dinner,
baby. Oh!

04:54.669 --> 04:56.046
You wanna tell me
the odds against that?

04:56.087 --> 04:57.213
Come on.
- You lucky prick.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.798
- Boys, I'm sorry--
[gunshots]

04:58.840 --> 05:00.342
- All right!
Everybody get on the ground!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.301
Everybody get down
on the ground!

05:01.343 --> 05:02.802
Hands on the table!

05:02.844 --> 05:04.262
Put your hands on the table!

05:04.304 --> 05:05.680
Nice and slow!

05:05.722 --> 05:08.183
Do it or I will
fill you with holes.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.476
Now! Hands!

05:09.517 --> 05:10.643
Where's the cash?

05:13.355 --> 05:14.981
- Do you know who I am?

05:15.023 --> 05:15.940
- Shut up!

05:17.859 --> 05:18.943
Rolex!

05:18.985 --> 05:21.696
Let's have it.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.114
Now!
- All right.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.324
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:24.366 --> 05:28.703
* *

05:28.745 --> 05:29.871
- [yells]

05:29.913 --> 05:31.790
[gunshots]

05:37.712 --> 05:39.839
- Zaco, you dial 911.

05:39.881 --> 05:46.805
* *

05:52.977 --> 05:54.396
- Adam?

05:54.437 --> 05:56.815
- Boss, I'm at a poker game
that just got ripped.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.150
Two people shot, one dead.
Offenders are in the wind.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.361
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, yeah.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.154
- Okay, where are you?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.490
- [clears throat]
Oasis Bar on Sumac.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.616
- I know it.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.576
It's been raided
a couple times for dope.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.371
[stammers] Vice and Narcotics
got that place

06:11.413 --> 06:13.039
all over their radar, Adam.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.874
- Yeah, I know.
I know I shouldn't be here.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.459
- All right.
Do they know you're police?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.211
- No, I'm under.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.379
Ex-CI invited me.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.548
I was just playing poker,

06:21.589 --> 06:22.841
grabbing intel,
that sort of thing.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.217
I'm just going crazy
sitting at home.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.969
- Did you return fire?

06:26.011 --> 06:28.555
- Two rounds from my UC gun.
Missed.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.057
Boss, my CI Zaco,
he called 911.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.893
Ambos and Patrol
are arriving right now.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.062
- Adam, if you stay there,
the only thing you're doing

06:36.104 --> 06:38.064
is ending your career.
You understand?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.358
- Yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.484
- Now just stand down.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.528
Get the hell out of there now.

06:43.570 --> 06:49.451
* *

06:54.122 --> 06:54.497
.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.999
- Alexandria Cook, arrested a
couple times for prostitution.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.126
No other priors.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.295
19.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.421
- Med called.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.006
Male victim didn't make it.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.758
Uh, looks like we're
looking at a double now.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.552
- Who was he?
- Mark Gargano. Long sheet.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.304
Agg assault.
Two armed robberies.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.472
- All right.
Any witnesses talk?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.015
- Most took off,
but Patrol grabbed

07:12.057 --> 07:13.808
two of the poker players.
They're outside in the alley.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.643
We got a Wes Arben.
He owns the joint.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.979
Did two years
in Danville on distro.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.523
Word is he runs half the coke
between here and Bridgeport.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.525
The other guy is Zachary Munn.
Goes by Zaco.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.570
Just did a six-month stint
in Sheridan for burglary.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.072
- Why we taking this, Sarge?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.367
Rip of an illegal poker game?

07:30.408 --> 07:31.868
Feels like Robbery/Homicide.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.455
- Hailey,
get Arben's statement.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.082
Kev, pods and cam.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.167
Kim, come on, you and me,
we'll take the burglar.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.377
Let's go.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.507
- Where do you keep the cash?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.050
- In a red duffel bag.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.928
I know the law.
The game was legit.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.347
- We got two dead bodies,
and one's 19.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.807
It's not legit.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
But we don't give
a rat's ass about poker.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.061
What did you see?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.854
- Whole lot of nothing.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.315
A couple of pricks
in masks with guns.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.526
- What'd they look like?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.985
- I don't know.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.279
I was busy grabbing
my hands on the floor.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.907
- How many people
were at the table?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.033
- Six, maybe.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.244
- Okay, great.
We're gonna need names.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.372
- Oh, I don't know names.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.000
Look, I'm the new guy,
all right?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.001
It's my cousin's game.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.335
- You sat at the table
for hours,

08:22.377 --> 08:24.629
you didn't get anybody's name?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.548
- Real quiet bunch.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.883
- You sticking with that story?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.010
- I might, yeah.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.179
- You.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.057
Come.
- Excuse me.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.351
Hello, who are you?
- The dumbo's sister.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.477
- Let her in.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.939
Were you at the bar tonight?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.233
- Hell no.
I got a three-month-old.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.945
Are you through with him?
'Cause he's got work early.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.405
- Yeah.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.574
I gotta get up early for work.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.034
- Oh, yeah?
Where do you work?

08:55.618 --> 08:57.495
- He's a carpenter.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.206
Yeah, he's got
a repair job in Cicero.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.624
- Yeah, a carpenter.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.752
- Are you done with him?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.295
- Yeah, you're good.

09:05.337 --> 09:09.257
Just leave your contact info
with that officer over there.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.300
- All right.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.468
- Thanks.
- Thanks, guys.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.635
- Uh-huh.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.313
All right. What do we got?

09:23.355 --> 09:25.607
- Techs found fresh blood
leading out the rear door,

09:25.648 --> 09:26.941
and Arvin said one
of the offenders

09:26.983 --> 09:28.360
got winged in the shoulder,
so it could be his.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.778
They're running it.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.863
- The Chevy Malibu was
caught five minutes away

09:31.905 --> 09:34.449
on a red light cam
two blocks from the robbery

09:34.491 --> 09:35.867
going 70 miles an hour.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.744
Wisconsin plates came back hot.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.330
I have a BOLO out. No hits yet.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.124
- And our owner, Arben,
what do we know about him?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.876
- Really just
old school, Sarge.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.629
Lives big, likes to flash his
drug money and throw parties.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.047
It's a big cash game.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
Honestly sounds
like an inside job.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.133
- Agreed. Let's chase that.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.928
Who knew about the poker game?
Who knew it was so fat?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.596
Let's dig into Arben's crew,

09:56.638 --> 09:58.223
see if he was beefing
with anyone.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.557
Let's move quick.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.060
- Sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.019
Sergeant Voight.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.354
- Sir.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.272
- David Frume, IAD.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.816
Do you have a minute?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.567
- Sure. We're good?
- We're on it, Sarge.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
- Come on in.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.572
[soft suspenseful music]

10:14.614 --> 10:21.705
* *

10:46.896 --> 10:51.901
- It's not my place, but IAD.

10:51.943 --> 10:55.572
If there's something I should
know, you can let me know.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.784
- I was just about
to call Adam.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.204
- How bad is it?

11:03.246 --> 11:10.211
* *

11:18.136 --> 11:20.764
- Hey.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.058
You all right?

11:23.099 --> 11:25.852
- Yeah. Are you?

11:32.734 --> 11:36.112
- I was there.
I was at the game.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.530
- I know.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.574
I thought I recognized Zaco.
You pinched him, right?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.201
- Yeah, two years ago.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.244
I-99, confidential to me.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.746
He is a good CI.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.748
Been staying on the up and up.
Is he okay?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.041
Practically saved my life--

11:48.083 --> 11:50.043
- He's fine,
he covered for you.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.212
Adam, IAD talked to Voight.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.757
They found your slugs
in the wall at the poker room.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.676
He's gonna backdate
a stolen weapons report.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.219
You gotta get rid
of your UC gun,

11:59.260 --> 12:00.679
and he's not gonna
loop in anybody else.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.763
- I gotta call him.
- Adam. Adam.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.098
- I think I should be
working off book

12:03.139 --> 12:04.766
on this thing with you guys.
- Honey, just--stop.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.226
This is exactly
what you should not be doing.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.352
- I do not like this.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.229
I cannot have everybody
protecting me.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.773
- You can,
because that is what you need.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.941
You've got the team.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.609
They will find
the offenders fast

12:14.651 --> 12:16.611
and will keep you out of it.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.281
[pensive music]

12:20.323 --> 12:22.992
So this is your
weekly poker game.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.246
It's not with the old timers
at the cop bar.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.664
- Sometimes.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
Zaco invited me.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.419
I was covert.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.421
I was--you know, I was
listening for information.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.136
I just miss it, Kim.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.596
Chasing defenders
into yards with crazy dogs

12:43.638 --> 12:46.766
and split second
decisions and the,

12:46.808 --> 12:49.352
you know, adrenaline,
feeling alive.

12:53.356 --> 12:56.609
The poker game, it just
gave me that for a second.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.612
- These are the things
we tell each other now, right?

12:59.654 --> 13:01.906
When you're in it, you tell me.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.700
And I know that it's hard
because you nearly died.

13:03.742 --> 13:04.993
But I get that.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.494
I get it, too,
because I've been through it.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.831
But you have to tell me
so I can help you.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.878
Look at me.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.673
I've got you.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.342
- Of course.

13:20.383 --> 13:24.846
* *

13:32.562 --> 13:32.771
.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.647
- [knocks on door]

13:37.484 --> 13:39.569
- All right, what do we got?
- These are our offenders.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.820
Techs just reached out.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.572
Blood trail DNA
from the poker rip

13:42.614 --> 13:43.907
came back to this guy,
Troy Bala.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.992
That's his brother Clay Bala.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.869
They live around the corner.
Kev's taking a peek right now.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.995
- Okay.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.330
- The Bala brothers
like to rob banks.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.956
Modern Frank and Jesse James.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.708
No cowboy boots,
but they like their guns.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.752
- A year ago, they hit
Beacon Bank and Trust.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.337
Killed a security guard.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.714
Case was dropped when
the only eyewitness recanted.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.132
- How did they know
about the poker game?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.468
- We figure Arben
sold them the score.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.095
- Definite inside job.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.680
The brothers grew up
with Arben.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.931
They're tight.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.724
We got a hold
of Clay's cell phone.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.935
He made three calls to Arben
the night of the rip.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.770
The last one was
ten minutes before the rip.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.522
No way that was a coincidence.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.815
- Go ahead, Kev.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.191
- The house is quiet
right now.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.069
Got a black Camaro
sitting out front.

14:21.111 --> 14:25.824
Illinois tag.
Nora Tom Zebra 3581.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.826
- Camaro's registered
to Clay Bala.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.411
- We got paper on the house?

14:29.452 --> 14:30.495
- Signed and ready to go.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.663
- Let's hit it.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.041
[dramatic music]

14:35.083 --> 14:39.254
* *

14:39.295 --> 14:40.213
[knocking on door]

14:42.799 --> 14:45.635
[mellow music playing
over speakers]

14:45.677 --> 14:52.809
* *

14:53.560 --> 14:55.228
[line ringing]

14:55.270 --> 14:57.063
[phone buzzes]

14:57.105 --> 14:58.815
- [sighs]

14:58.857 --> 15:01.317
No, I don't have
your test results.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.777
- That's not what
I'm calling about.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.988
- Okay, what's up?
- I have a small favor to ask.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.281
Intelligence was
out chasing a lead.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.323
They back yet?

15:07.365 --> 15:08.950
- Nope.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.036
- Could we maybe elaborate
on that just a little bit?

15:11.077 --> 15:13.496
- According to the log,
an arrest warrant

15:13.538 --> 15:16.207
was served on Troy
and Clay Bala minutes ago...

15:16.249 --> 15:17.709
- Kay.
- But their place was empty.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.210
They're in the wind.
- All right.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.920
Well, when they get back,
if they need anything--

15:20.962 --> 15:22.005
- Not gonna happen.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.631
Adam, just ride the bench.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.716
I'll see you soon.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.884
[line beeps]

15:29.262 --> 15:32.182
[muffled music playing]

15:32.223 --> 15:39.147
* *

15:41.733 --> 15:43.610
[footsteps approaching]

15:44.611 --> 15:46.237
- Hey, Marla.
How are you doing?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.530
Zaco home?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.740
- No.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.241
[baby crying]

15:50.283 --> 15:51.701
He's done his time.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.995
He's paid his debts to you.
Leave him alone.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.580
- Look, I'm not trying
to drag him into anything.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.831
I just need to talk to him.
Zaco.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.625
- He's not home, so...

16:00.669 --> 16:02.462
- Right.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.130
You got a second, bro?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.132
- Yeah. Of course.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.553
- All right.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.097
Come on.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.474
Thanks, Marla.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.767
- I didn't tell them anything.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.435
- Yeah, no, I never thought
you would, Z.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.604
But thank you.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.147
Gotta put the stickup guys
away fast.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.858
You seen Troy Bala
or his brother?

16:23.900 --> 16:25.694
- I can't get involved.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.113
You know that.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.616
My sister's letting me
stay here for free.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.118
I'm not gonna throw that away.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.245
I mean, all she's
having me do is watch the kid.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.413
- Yeah, I know.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.956
I'm not jamming you
up here, all right?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.499
It's just me asking.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.792
- Shouldn't you be staying low?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.377
- Not if I wanna
fix this thing.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.254
- Fix what?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.131
We got ambushed.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.258
- Zaco, I swear to you,
I'm not trying to pull you in,

16:48.299 --> 16:49.426
I promise you.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.428
I'm just trying
to make this thing right.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.930
I gotta make it right.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.640
Do you know where Troy
and Clay would hide?

16:55.682 --> 16:56.850
Please.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.272
I'm begging you here.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.278
Please.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.988
- Yeah. Uh...

17:12.032 --> 17:15.035
Troy, his girl's Gigi.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.579
- Okay.
- Gigi Balducci.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.999
She's over on South Laurel.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.793
- Good man. Thank you.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.755
[suspenseful music]

17:26.796 --> 17:33.928
* *

17:36.056 --> 17:37.849
- I got eyes
on the Bala brothers.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
- What? Where?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.686
- Troy Bala's
girlfriend's house.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.147
Gigi Balducci, 6100 Laurel.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.940
I'm parked down the street.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.734
- Adam.
- Zaco told me off record.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.069
I'm not gonna hit it.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.029
Just hold anchor here
until the team arrives,

17:51.071 --> 17:53.031
then I'll pull away, I promise.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.366
Boss, they're right here.
Just come take 'em.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.744
- All right, we'll be en route.
ETA five minutes.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.540
- Hold on. Sarge?
- Yeah?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.459
- I got a car in Gigi's alley.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.589
Someone's approaching
the house.

18:09.631 --> 18:10.757
- Anyone we know?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.884
- No, it's too dark.
I can't tell.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.181
Walking up to the door now.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.476
He's knocking.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.435
All right.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.942
They let him inside.
Should be a friend.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.237
[gunshots]

18:32.278 --> 18:34.114
I got shots fired.
I'm going in.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.241
- Adam, Adam! Wait!

18:36.282 --> 18:37.033
Adam!

18:37.075 --> 18:40.245
[dramatic music]

18:40.286 --> 18:47.210
* *

19:10.483 --> 19:12.444
- [whimpers]

19:12.485 --> 19:13.778
- You just hold on.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.779
I'm gonna be with you
in two seconds, all right?

19:14.821 --> 19:15.947
You just hold on.

19:15.989 --> 19:16.865
Why don't you
tell me your name?

19:16.906 --> 19:17.991
What's your name?

19:19.784 --> 19:21.077
- Clay.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.204
- Clay Bala. Yeah?

19:23.246 --> 19:24.914
All right, Clay Bala,
I'm police.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.458
I want you to tell me
who did this to you.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.460
Can you do that for me?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.795
- Wes.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.297
Wes Arben.
- Wes Arben.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.214
Okay, good.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.716
I can hear that.
I can hear that.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.800
Now you hold on.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.135
The ambulance is on the way.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.636
They're gonna
be here any minute.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.804
Tell me that again.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.306
Tell me who did this
to you, Clay.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.223
Can you tell me?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.476
Who did this to you, Clay?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.603
Clay. Clay.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.605
Clay. Come on, man.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.981
Who did this to you?

19:53.568 --> 19:56.112
God damn it!

19:56.154 --> 19:58.782
[car tires screech]
[dog barking]

19:58.823 --> 20:05.955
* *

20:11.711 --> 20:13.213
- Come on, let's go!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.216
I got bodies.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.225
- I'll clear the house.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.697
House is clear.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.907
- Yeah, they're all dead.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.204
All right, 50-21, roll the
crime lab to 6100 South Laurel.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.872
Got a triple homicide.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.124
Right, call the team.

20:49.165 --> 20:53.920
* *

20:58.633 --> 20:59.009
.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.135
- Techs recovered five
9-mil shell casings.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.262
- Recovered this
from a ceiling tile.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.014
Matches the bag
from the poker rip.

21:04.055 --> 21:05.849
It's gotta be
the Bala brothers' cut.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.267
- Right, so Arben gets nervous.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.686
No one's supposed
to die at the rip.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.021
Covers his tracks.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.647
- Yo, so I got one guy to talk.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.191
Witness said that he heard
the gunshots, looks outside,

21:15.233 --> 21:17.235
and he saw a bearded
white male, about 6'1",

21:17.277 --> 21:18.528
run into the house.

21:18.570 --> 21:19.904
- Wait, after the shots?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.614
- Yeah.
That's what the man said.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.616
- All right,
so stay on PODs and camp.

21:23.658 --> 21:24.909
Dig up more witnesses.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.454
Got a real good idea
who wanted these men dead.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.455
Let's go.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.096
- It was Arben.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.973
Clay Bala gave me
a dying confession.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.433
All right, so we can say
I was driving by.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.311
I heard the shots, I went in--
- No. No.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.854
- Boss, if we say that,
we can use this--

21:52.896 --> 21:54.356
- We can't.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.316
Adam, look,
we bring you into this,

21:56.358 --> 21:58.943
Arben'll put you
at the poker game.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.528
Look, what is this?

22:00.570 --> 22:03.073
You go crazy at home, you need
a poker game for a buzz.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.741
Yeah, I get that.

22:04.783 --> 22:08.453
But this, this I don't get.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.372
Whatever's going on in your
head 'cause you got shot--

22:10.413 --> 22:12.165
- No, my head is fine, sir.
- It's clearly not.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.209
- No, no. It is.
I don't have PTSD.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.211
I'm not traumatized.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.253
I just miss the job.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.005
[pensive music]

22:19.047 --> 22:20.882
I need the job.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.593
I can't keep sitting at home,
what, becoming my father?

22:23.635 --> 22:25.053
This is what happened
to him, boss.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.763
He took disability leave
because he tripped

22:26.805 --> 22:28.973
down some pimp's fire escape.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.102
He got back on the job,
but he was never the same.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.688
- You're not him.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.148
You're gonna be back
in a couple of days.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.650
- What if I'm not?

22:38.692 --> 22:40.568
- You still won't be.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.950
All right?
You need to back off.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.035
Back off, you understand?

22:49.077 --> 22:50.745
- Understood.

22:50.787 --> 22:54.541
* *

22:54.582 --> 22:56.292
- Evidence at the house
suggests a lone shooter.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.169
All the slugs,
all the shell casings,

22:58.211 --> 22:59.713
they come back
to one stolen gun.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.840
- Also, Sarge, a new witness
came forward and said

23:01.881 --> 23:03.758
that they saw the same
bearded white male

23:03.800 --> 23:05.051
running away from the house

23:05.093 --> 23:06.845
five minutes
after the gunshots.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.430
And hopped into a gray Jeep.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.891
- I saw that Jeep
leaving the scene

23:11.933 --> 23:13.143
when we showed up, Sarge.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.894
- Okay, you get the tags?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.354
- No, it was dark,

23:16.396 --> 23:18.231
but I'm pretty sure
it was a Jeep Wrangler.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.608
We all saw Clay's
gunshot wound, right?

23:20.650 --> 23:21.735
The towel.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.319
Somebody was trying
to save his life.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.988
Somebody who knew
exactly what to do.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.573
Someone like a cop.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.450
- You got something
to say, say it.

23:31.745 --> 23:35.331
- Adam drives a Jeep Wrangler.
He fits the description.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.083
You don't have to protect us.
You can just loop us in.

23:37.125 --> 23:40.170
- I already handled it.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.588
- Adam found the Bala brothers.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.882
How? And what else
does he know?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.842
- Nothing that can help.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.096
Look, anybody has a problem
working this case,

23:50.138 --> 23:51.806
they can walk.

23:51.848 --> 23:54.059
No repercussions.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.477
Good.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.146
So find some evidence
or some leverage on Arben.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.939
Let's bury this prick.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.649
Now.

24:01.691 --> 24:07.489
* *

24:07.530 --> 24:09.991
- So Wes Arben,
this guy's real smart.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.744
Everything's in his wife's name
and she's clean as a whistle.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.287
Properties, cars.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.081
Even got a 40-foot yacht
docked at Burnham Harbor,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.166
so business must be real good.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.460
- Oh, hey.
I got something too.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.920
- Yeah?
- Yep.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.132
- Zaco from the poker game?

24:26.174 --> 24:27.467
- Yeah.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.718
Been pinched
for coke possession

24:28.760 --> 24:30.053
on the corner
of Polk and Kilpatrick

24:30.095 --> 24:32.305
three different times.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.598
He ain't that smart.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.184
Every time, Arben posted bond.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.396
- Okay.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.731
- Okay, so these guys
are obviously tight.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.275
That's our leverage
right there, Burgess.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.571
What's the problem?

24:51.324 --> 24:52.909
- Nothing.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.202
You're right.

24:54.244 --> 24:57.247
Zaco's all we've got.
Let's go get him.

24:57.288 --> 25:04.421
* *

25:23.815 --> 25:25.442
- Okay, that's him.

25:25.483 --> 25:26.568
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.373
- Come on.
- Chicago PD.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.624
- Come on, bro.
I didn't do nothing.

25:41.666 --> 25:42.834
- You didn't do nothing?
- I didn't do nothing.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.419
- Oh, really?
- That's our guy.

25:44.461 --> 25:45.545
- I didn't do nothing.
- I'm just gonna check this.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.963
Just in case.
- Then that's on us.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.257
- Come on. That's nothing.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.968
- That coke buy
was a parole violation.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.887
- Don't you guys got
bigger fish to fry?

25:53.928 --> 25:55.764
- Yeah. We do, actually.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.061
[lock clicks]
- The hell is this?

26:01.102 --> 26:03.480
- Phone records between
Wes Arben and Troy Bala

26:03.521 --> 26:05.065
the night of the poker rip.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.359
Arben orchestrated the robbery.
Were you tipped off?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.526
- Was I tipped off?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.445
No.
- Hmm.

26:10.487 --> 26:11.946
- I almost got shot.

26:11.988 --> 26:15.950
- Then let's talk about
the Bala brothers.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.244
- Oh.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.579
Why are you showing me that?

26:22.540 --> 26:25.460
You--you think I whacked 'em?

26:25.502 --> 26:27.379
- No, you were home.
We talked to your neighbors.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.588
We think Arben's good for it.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.382
We don't have enough evidence,
though.

26:34.469 --> 26:38.056
- So this is what
Ruzek's promises look like.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.646
- What promises?

26:46.981 --> 26:51.403
- Yeah, that I wasn't gonna be
dragged into this.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.904
That he'd protect me.

26:55.073 --> 26:58.284
That's why I'm in this cage
right now, right?

26:58.326 --> 26:59.703
It's 'cause of him?

27:01.538 --> 27:03.623
It's 'cause
you're protecting him.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.083
That's why we're here.

27:05.125 --> 27:08.336
That's why none of this
is being recorded.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.838
[scoffs]

27:09.879 --> 27:11.881
I know he wasn't supposed
to be at that game.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.383
He wasn't supposed
to be begging me

27:13.425 --> 27:16.136
to take him, either.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.972
All right, that comes out,
and his ass is fired.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.473
I know that.

27:20.515 --> 27:27.647
* *

27:29.399 --> 27:34.237
- If I protect Adam, means
I'm also protecting you, Zaco.

27:34.279 --> 27:35.739
Tell me about Arben.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.991
- [laughs]

27:38.033 --> 27:39.576
Uh-uh.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.953
You're lying again.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.539
Okay, you don't want me
to tell you about him.

27:44.581 --> 27:48.126
You want me to give him to you.

27:48.168 --> 27:51.129
You want me to work for you.
I know what that looks like.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.547
- Zaco, you don't talk,

27:52.589 --> 27:53.965
you get five years
in prison for the drugs.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.384
I don't know what else
to tell you.

28:00.597 --> 28:03.391
- If you want me,
there's a price.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.522
- Okay.

28:09.564 --> 28:12.901
- I want the drug charges
dropped.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.862
I wanna get paid good CI money.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.533
And I want you
to help my sister.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.452
- Your sister?

28:22.494 --> 28:24.537
- Yeah, she's in line

28:24.579 --> 28:27.499
for the new public housing
unit in Hyde Park.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.295
Okay, she goes to the front
of that line,

28:32.337 --> 28:33.838
or you can kiss my ass goodbye,

28:33.880 --> 28:35.882
and I'll expose Ruzek
for all of this.

28:35.924 --> 28:38.551
- CPD has nothing to do with--
- It's Chicago.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.053
Bribe someone.

28:40.095 --> 28:44.808
* *

28:49.646 --> 28:49.854
.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.398
- Goal is to get Arben talking.
We need a confession on tape.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.359
- I got it.
This ain't my first barbecue.

28:54.401 --> 28:55.944
All right, I know
how to get him tripping.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.405
- And try and stay face to face
with him so we can see him.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.948
Don't switch locations.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.950
Don't fiddle with the camera.
- Look, I got it. I got it.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.868
- Okay.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.995
- How we doing
on Marla's housing?

29:06.037 --> 29:08.206
- All it took was
10 grand, but she's in.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.249
- Serious?

29:09.290 --> 29:11.001
- About the 10 grand?

29:11.042 --> 29:12.002
No, come on.

29:15.005 --> 29:17.090
But she's in.
Top floor view of the lake.

29:23.013 --> 29:25.682
- You know,
I take zero pleasure

29:25.724 --> 29:27.851
in using them like this,
really.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.605
Is he doing okay?

29:35.025 --> 29:36.568
- You don't need to worry
about that.

29:36.609 --> 29:39.237
You just worry about
Arben, all right?

29:39.279 --> 29:41.031
We're set. Let's go.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.921
- You see anything, Kim?

30:00.425 --> 30:01.801
- Nothing yet.

30:09.476 --> 30:13.146
[phone buzzes]

30:13.188 --> 30:14.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.024
Just checking in.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.193
- All is good over here
with Mr. Fixit.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.944
It's a thrill a minute.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.491
- Adam, you know it's all
gonna be okay, right?

30:24.532 --> 30:25.825
- Mm-hm.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.035
- I've been trying
to be positive

30:27.077 --> 30:28.536
because I know
that you're gonna pass,

30:28.578 --> 30:29.788
and I know
you're gonna be back.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.874
But if you don't,
it's gonna be okay.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.001
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.420
- Kim, it--

30:37.462 --> 30:38.588
Kim?
- Yeah?

30:38.630 --> 30:40.590
- It won't, okay?

30:40.632 --> 30:42.258
I'm no good without
the job, you know that.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.135
I'll find something
to fill this thing in me.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.679
It'll probably be
something wrong.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.347
You know, I'll lose you,
lose Mak.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.307
- I have to go, I'm sorry.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.309
- Why, what's going on?

30:51.351 --> 30:52.727
- We're going after Arben.

30:52.769 --> 30:54.437
[tense music]

30:54.479 --> 30:56.106
- How?

30:56.147 --> 30:57.732
- Using Zaco.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.442
- No, wait, I promised him
I wouldn't--

30:59.484 --> 31:01.611
- I didn't have another way,
and Zaco compromised himself.

31:01.653 --> 31:02.779
That is on him.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.614
I have to go.

31:04.656 --> 31:07.659
- Son of a bitch, man.

31:07.701 --> 31:14.165
* *

31:14.207 --> 31:15.625
- Yo.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.586
- What's up, hotshot?

31:18.628 --> 31:20.839
- What's up?
You wanna grab a bite?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.841
- No, first some errands.
Let's go.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.011
- Oh.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.679
Man, you sure?

31:27.721 --> 31:29.139
- Let's go.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.057
- They got a killer
chili burger here.

31:31.099 --> 31:32.976
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten all day.

31:33.018 --> 31:36.271
- Just shut up
and get in the car.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.773
- Don't get in, Zaco.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.652
- Come on.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.112
- All right.

31:44.154 --> 31:46.281
- No, no, no, no.

31:46.322 --> 31:53.246
* *

31:55.331 --> 31:56.499
- He's mobile.

31:56.541 --> 31:58.043
I got him.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.169
- Where are we--
where are we going?

31:59.210 --> 32:00.128
- You'll see.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.254
- Headed for the Hellcat,
Sarge.

32:01.296 --> 32:02.464
I'll catch up.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.716
- Copy, Kev.
Head over to 22nd.

32:04.758 --> 32:07.719
Kim, run parallel on 13.

32:07.761 --> 32:09.929
- Copy you, Sarge.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.728
- After all we been through,
you'd think I'd get a taste.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.480
- Taste of what?
- The rip.

32:18.521 --> 32:20.065
Troy told me you ordered it.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.399
- Yeah?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.568
- Is that why
you took care of him?

32:23.610 --> 32:25.278
He's talking too much?

32:27.614 --> 32:29.199
[tires screech]

32:31.451 --> 32:33.286
- Son of a bitch.

32:33.328 --> 32:34.704
- We lost eyes.

32:34.746 --> 32:36.873
We think they're
headed south on Wabash.

32:36.915 --> 32:38.750
- Copy. I'll head that way.

32:38.792 --> 32:45.924

32:50.804 --> 32:53.473
- Where were you yesterday, Z?

32:53.515 --> 32:54.766
- Yesterday.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.309
Um...
[static crackling]

32:56.351 --> 32:57.560
I was at home.

32:57.602 --> 32:59.270
[voice cutting out]
In the garage, uh--

32:59.312 --> 33:01.731
I got these new clips
and cylinders for the Harley.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.275
- That's weird,
'cause I swung by twice.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.152
You weren't there.

33:06.194 --> 33:07.779
- Oh, yeah.

33:07.821 --> 33:08.947
I was in the garage.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.448
- Yeah, I checked the garage.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.825
Why are you lying?

33:11.866 --> 33:13.410
- Yo, I'm--
[static crackling]

33:15.495 --> 33:17.080
- I lost him.

33:17.122 --> 33:19.124
Kim, you still got your feed?

33:21.167 --> 33:23.003
- I'm dark.
They must be out of range.

33:23.044 --> 33:25.505
- Just ping Zaco's phone.

33:25.547 --> 33:28.925
- This is Detective Hailey
Upton, badge number 55055.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.927
Requesting an emergency ping.

33:30.969 --> 33:34.097
[phone buzzing]

33:41.438 --> 33:43.314
- I'm sorry, I was
in and out all day.

33:43.356 --> 33:46.693
I don't know when you were--
when you were there.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.696
- So it was just bad timing.

33:49.738 --> 33:51.656
- Yo, why are we
at the old place?

33:51.698 --> 33:52.824

[phone buzzes]

33:59.539 --> 34:00.707
- Adam?

34:00.749 --> 34:02.334
- Hey, what the hell
is going on?

34:02.375 --> 34:04.419
Zaco just dialed me.
Is he driving?

34:04.461 --> 34:05.837
- Yeah, we lost his signal.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.047
We're trying to get
a ping on his phone.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.298
- Why'd he go mobile?

34:08.340 --> 34:09.674
- Arben made him
get in his car.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.551
We lost him going south
on Wabash.

34:11.593 --> 34:13.386
- All right, okay, so they're
headed right towards me.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.847
He must have known
he was out of range.

34:15.889 --> 34:19.684
So I'm gonna see
if I can tap in here.

34:19.726 --> 34:26.858
* *

34:32.405 --> 34:34.282
Okay, I got a signal.
- Is he okay?

34:34.324 --> 34:36.576
- I don't know.
Give me a second.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.204
- Take off your jacket.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.373
Do it.

34:41.414 --> 34:43.416
- All right, dude.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.293
[chuckles]

34:46.920 --> 34:49.214
Did I tell you, I got--
I got--

34:49.255 --> 34:51.132
I got two tickets
to the Bears game on Sunday.

34:51.174 --> 34:54.177
- Tickets, Adam.
Tickets, that is his safe word.

34:57.472 --> 34:59.057
- Old place.
Uh...

34:59.099 --> 35:01.017
He mentioned the old place.

35:01.059 --> 35:02.519
The poker game,
it used to be held

35:02.560 --> 35:04.437
at an old abandoned furniture
factory his dad owns.

35:04.479 --> 35:06.231
He knew I'd know that.
- Where is it?

35:06.272 --> 35:09.275
- It's, like, right by us.
Like, 44th and Wallace.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.402
I'm heading there.

35:10.443 --> 35:12.112
- No, Adam,
you have to wait for us.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.905
You can't be there.
Arben can't see you.

35:13.947 --> 35:15.198
You can't be on record.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.033
- Well, I'm not letting
Zaco die, so...

35:17.075 --> 35:18.410
- All right.
I'll loop in Voight.

35:18.451 --> 35:20.245
We'll roll your way.

35:26.501 --> 35:26.876

you rat bitch!

35:51.234 --> 35:53.069
[gunshot]

35:53.737 --> 35:55.989
- Chicago PD!

35:56.031 --> 35:57.824
You point that at him again,
I'll put you down.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.702
- AJ?

36:00.744 --> 36:02.412
- Drop the gun, Arben.

36:03.496 --> 36:06.124
- Mm-mm.
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.876
- Ruze.

36:10.253 --> 36:11.921
- Hold on, Zaco.

36:14.257 --> 36:15.216
Kim?

36:15.258 --> 36:16.259
Arben shot Zaco.

36:16.301 --> 36:17.677
He fled out the back
of the building.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.387
I need an ambo right now.

36:19.429 --> 36:20.513
- On it.

36:20.555 --> 36:21.723
- All right.

36:21.765 --> 36:24.017
[somber music]

36:24.059 --> 36:25.602
Just hold on, man.

36:25.643 --> 36:27.020
Hold on. I got you.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.063
- Where you been, bro?

36:28.104 --> 36:29.230
- I'm right here, man.

36:29.272 --> 36:30.982
I'm right here, okay?
You just hold on.

36:31.024 --> 36:33.360
The ambulance is on the way.

36:33.401 --> 36:35.820
Just hold on.

36:35.862 --> 36:37.906
Okay?

36:37.947 --> 36:40.450
I got you.

36:46.414 --> 36:47.916
[tires screech]

36:49.501 --> 36:52.045
- Chicago PD! Arben, stop!

36:55.465 --> 36:57.258
Sarge, I've got Arben
running into a gangway.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.260
Red and yellow brick building,
corner of Wallace.

36:59.302 --> 37:00.637

38:36.483 --> 38:38.360
- BP's strong.
Bleeding stopped.

38:38.401 --> 38:39.819
It was a through and through.

38:39.861 --> 38:41.780
Looks like
nothing major was hit.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.114
- All right.

38:44.949 --> 38:47.035
- Really?

38:47.077 --> 38:49.496
Hear that, Ruze?

38:49.537 --> 38:51.581
I'm gonna be okay.
She's not--she's not lying?

38:51.623 --> 38:54.250
- No, see, you got lucky.

38:58.463 --> 38:59.714
- Full blow, man.

38:59.756 --> 39:02.008
- [chuckles]
- Come on.

Right?

Jesus.

39:06.638 --> 39:09.557
Hey, that was fun as hell.

39:09.599 --> 39:12.644
Hey, we should
do that again, huh?

39:12.686 --> 39:14.354
- You're crazy, Z.

Hey, dude, look, uh...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I jammed you.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.233
Matches the weapon used
in the Bala murders.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.902
EMTs didn't put you
in the report.

40:02.944 --> 40:04.446
Case is closed.
- Okay.

40:04.487 --> 40:07.407
- Voight says IAD
is backing off.

40:07.449 --> 40:10.076
Stolen weapons report
went through.

40:10.118 --> 40:11.911
- So I'm in the clear.

40:11.953 --> 40:13.038
- Yeah.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.206
- All right.

40:18.752 --> 40:20.420

We weren't able to revive him.

I was just talking to him.

40:33.725 --> 40:35.769
He was fine.
He was completely coherent.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.312
- I'm sorry, bullet fragments
lodged in his heart.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.563
There was nothing we could do.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.440
- Hold on, though.

40:40.482 --> 40:41.775
That doesn't make any sense.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.779
- This is on you.

40:48.114 --> 40:50.158
No.
