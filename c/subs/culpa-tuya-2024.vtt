01:03.280 --> 01:06.600
Your Fault

01:19.040 --> 01:21.160
- Thank you for coming.
- Ciao.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.720
Eh-eh-eh! Those glasses stay here.
Thank you.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.360
Hey, it's not
an aphrodisiac cocktail, is it?

01:37.440 --> 01:39.840
When you go up to the room,
you'll see it's not.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.160
- Ciao, Noah.
- Ciao.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.400
Hey, I didn't see Nick!

01:43.480 --> 01:44.960
Yeah, he couldn't come.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.800
He's doing an internship
at a law firm in San Francisco.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.200
And I keep telling his father
not to give him too much work, but...

01:51.280 --> 01:53.200
- chuckles]
- The glasses.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.320
- What a shame.
- Anyway...

01:55.400 --> 01:56.760
- Ciao, María.
- Have fun.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.560
- Your mother's cocktail is disgusting.
- Yeah, it tastes like melted candy.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.520
Look, come with me.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.280
The party starts now.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.000
- There you go.
- But only one, okay?

02:15.080 --> 02:17.880
Tomorrow I have to help
Morti and Petra clean up.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.960
For God's sake, let them do their job.
Don't complicate it for the rest of us.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.240
Besides, tomorrow is a holiday!
It's the end of high school.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.920
Oh...

02:28.480 --> 02:30.800
I don't know if I'll go.
I don't feel like it.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.560
Hey.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.800
What's wrong?

02:36.440 --> 02:41.040
It will soon be a year
since my father's death.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.880
Look at me.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.760
I don't want to see you cry, okay?

02:46.480 --> 02:47.560
He had it coming.

02:48.880 --> 02:49.960
Yeah, I know.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.360
You must stand before him
and say goodbye to him once and for all.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.200
Someday. I promise.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.280
What a shitty year, huh?

02:59.360 --> 03:01.640
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.840
But I'm not enough for you, am I?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.640
I have hardly seen Nick
all these months, damn it.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.640
I don't even know why I'm taking this.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.080
Because when you do
see each other, all you do is fuck.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.080
You don't waste time.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.000
It's squeezing the most out of time.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.960
You're sure squeezing
the most out of him, right, sweetie?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.400
You extract all his juice.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.600
Come on.
Here's to finally being legal age.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.800
When you can finally do whatever you want,

03:26.880 --> 03:29.080
but you keep doing
what everybody else wants.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.920
You have just invented
the 18-year-old crisis.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.120
The magic pill.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.520
I knew you'd come.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.840
I missed touching you.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.760
I can't tell.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.400
You can't?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Mm. You taste like candy.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.120
- I prepared a special cocktail.
- You did?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.280
It's called Noah. Care to try it? Huh?

05:04.400 --> 05:07.200
I thought it couldn't get better.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.000
I have been rehearsing a lot. Mentally.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.360
I think you'll be very happy
being 18, Freckles.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.520
Here. Your gift.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.640
What is this?

05:25.320 --> 05:27.240
Nick, it's beautiful.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.080
Here.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.160
I'll wear it forever.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.360
Always.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.720
I just gave you my heart, Freckles.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.080
Please don't break it.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.200
Never.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.520
Hey!

06:24.400 --> 06:25.480
Yours, Noah!

07:45.960 --> 07:47.960
Noah!

07:48.520 --> 07:50.080
The party has already started!

07:53.080 --> 07:55.320
Goodbye, high school!

07:55.400 --> 07:57.880
Come on, girls!
Let's take off our uniforms.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.960
What are you doing here all alone?

08:16.520 --> 08:18.080
We used to burn books.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.600
The guys now are smarter.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.080
They'll invent anything
to get them butt naked.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.840
It's been five years and it shows, huh?

08:27.400 --> 08:28.440
You think?

08:29.160 --> 08:32.200
The other day I asked Jenna
what she wanted for her birthday.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.440
You know what she told me?

08:34.520 --> 08:35.600
That she didn't care,

08:35.680 --> 08:39.480
as long as it's nice outside so that
she can record an unboxing.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.240
When did the wrapping
start being cooler than the gift?

08:43.320 --> 08:44.880
We're getting old, man.

08:45.520 --> 08:49.600
They're unboxing their life
while we are just crumpled wrapping paper.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.640
Don't talk bullshit.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.000
They're going to college.

08:53.080 --> 08:57.040
While we work,
they'll only be thinking about having fun.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.000
We are number one at having fun.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.480
They're off to a dorm
full of people their age.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.560
Don't worry.
Those NPCs are not worth shit.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.280
I mean distance, man.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.560
Noah is staying here while you do
an internship across the pond.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.960
Jenna is going away to medical school,
and I cannot leave the garage.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.880
They're going to fly solo, Nick.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.080
Distance will ruin everything.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.720
Thomas Green.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.720
Noah Morán.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.040
Jenna Tavish.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.560
How are you, bro?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.080
Never better.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.000
Did you meet up with the insurer?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.240
Nope. Impossible.
They won't be sending any more cars.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.960
Sons of bitches.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.760
I am not good, Luca. I can't do this.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.520
- Don't even fucking say that.
- They all ask about you.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.320
When you're not there,
they take their cars elsewhere.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.720
Stay strong, brother.
I'll be out in a year.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.400
I try, but...

10:07.480 --> 10:10.000
I don't think
the garage will last that long.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.160
Actually, I'm not sure
it will even last a month.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.520
Not even a month?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.640
The rent has gone up again.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.480
I screwed up, man. I screwed up.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.480
Listen, asshole.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.040
I screwed up. You didn't, okay?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.600
If we stop sending money,
Mom will start worrying.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.080
Maybe a transfer of ownership--

10:32.160 --> 10:35.760
We're not going to close the garage.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.040
You hear me?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.320
Never.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.800
I don't understand how they can give
those supercars to 18-year-old girls.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.360
These parents have gone crazy.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.800
Stupid spoiled brats.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.440
Wow, looks like
you've spoiled the surprise.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.680
- No.
- Yes.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.200
Oh, my God!

11:08.880 --> 11:11.600
I can't believe it!

11:11.680 --> 11:12.920
Congratulations, nerd.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's beautiful. This is crazy! But...

11:15.080 --> 11:17.520
No, no, no. No, no. I shouldn't. No way.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.080
Dude, 18-inch alloy wheels.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.840
LED lights! I love it!

11:24.360 --> 11:25.360
I love it.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
Wow.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.880
I want to tell you something.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.240
Tell me.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.360
I have been thinking about it for a while.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.920
Fuck, don't go so fast, please.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.040
Don't be a pussy.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.080
We have been hiding for almost a year.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.840
I am sick of tiptoeing down the hall,
and doing it in the garden.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.920
On top of everything, your mother
has assigned Martín to spy on us.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.560
- It was your father.
- No, sorry.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.440
She's the one controlling us all day.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.720
Your father asked. Morti told me.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.320
Fine.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.360
- It's all the same.
- It's not the same. But go on.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.840
Fuck, can you stop? You'll get us killed.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.520
You've become such a bore when you drive.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.080
I want to show you something.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.120
So? What do you think?

12:33.200 --> 12:35.800
Well, it's amazing.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.760
The rent has to be obscene, right?

12:38.840 --> 12:41.560
I don't know.
It's a gift from my grandfather.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.680
- Nick, you can't accept it.
- And you can't accept that car.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.200
I know.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.000
It's a bitch to live
with contradictions, isn't it?

12:52.080 --> 12:53.440
Especially if you're rich.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.600
I'm not going back to San Francisco.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.920
That's going to kill my mother.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.960
To be an intern, I'd rather stay here.
I hate being away from you, Freckles.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.040
Plus, look at this light.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.360
It's perfect for us.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
Us?

13:13.960 --> 13:14.920
Yes.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.520
And it's close to the university.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.920
Isn't it a bit empty?

13:19.000 --> 13:24.080
Well, there are some things missing.
A pull-up bar, a safe...

13:24.880 --> 13:26.000
There is only one bed.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.160
Well... that's all we need.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.360
Just to kiss.

13:41.640 --> 13:42.720
Lower.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Lower.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.080
The perfect kiss...
in our perfect apartment.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.320
Well, we can decorate it.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.520
Though it seems a bit risky.
I'm not sure my mother will allow it.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.680
- She doesn't have to find out.
- How won't she find out?

14:06.760 --> 14:09.440
If I don't take the campus dorm,
where will I tell her I live?

14:10.640 --> 14:11.840
Live?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.760
That's not what you meant.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.360
This is so embarrassing.
Fuck, I'm an idiot.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.400
I am barely 18. What was I thinking?

14:25.480 --> 14:28.640
I don't know what I was thinking.
Please don't look at me.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.120
I don't know what I wanted.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.800
I've already accepted a car and that's
enough contradictions for one day.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.320
I am an asshole, man.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.720
You stressed me out
with the flying solo thing,

14:45.800 --> 14:47.520
and I wanted to keep her close.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.760
But I'm not sure
I'm ready to live together.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.640
I was so happy. I lost it.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.400
Girl, I swear romantic love
is a dangerous trap.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.160
I'm telling you.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.320
Look at my Prince Charming
tossing back Black Russians.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.960
And with no remorse
for bailing out on me at my graduation.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.760
I really want to live with her.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.120
But, if I think twice,
I get stressed as shit.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.640
- Want to talk about stress?
- Living with contradictions is fucked up.

15:11.720 --> 15:16.760
How much does her outfit cost?
The dress, the shoes, the accessories...

15:18.560 --> 15:19.640
Three thousand euros?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.640
How can you think about that
while she makes out with someone else?

15:25.320 --> 15:26.720
In your face.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.920
That's for bailing out on me.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.160
What was I thinking?

15:30.240 --> 15:33.040
My mother has always taught me
not to depend on any man.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.920
Yeah, well, and for me not to depend
on certain men.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.360
Similar.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.520
I cannot offer her a future
with that standard of living, man.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.040
- Money isn't important.
- Until you don't have it.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.520
But, anyway, you wouldn't know.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.200
- I'm in no mood for your crap right now.
- Nor am I for yours.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.120
Asshole.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.040
My father just bought a private jet,

15:52.120 --> 15:54.560
and he won't even let me
take him out for dinner.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.600
He makes me feel as if I were rubbing
the money in his face.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.360
Well, maybe instead of taking him
to posh restaurants,

16:00.440 --> 16:02.760
you could bring dinner over to the garage.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.120
Are you shitting me?

16:04.680 --> 16:08.560
Girl, you grew up with Nick.
You're like his sister.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.280
But I respect him, unlike you.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.960
Please help me understand him.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.240
I swear I saw fear in his eyes yesterday.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.160
It's the whole thing
about his mother abandoning him.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.600
He's that simple.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.720
Listen, he's crazy about you,

16:25.640 --> 16:28.920
but it'll always be hard for him to commit
because he's afraid of being abandoned.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.160
That's really deep, dude.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.680
Thanks.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.280
MOM

16:45.400 --> 16:47.200
Well, it seems like Jenna is bi now.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.720
It's the Black Russians.
She won't remember tomorrow.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.320
Why? What's in them?

16:53.400 --> 16:54.480
No one knows.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.840
Nobody has managed
to remember the ingredients.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.280
Well, then...

17:01.000 --> 17:02.040
to oblivion.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.880
To oblivion.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.440
Look, you each have a study.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.480
- This one and this one.
- How cool.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.280
And look at your bedroom.
It is so big. Wow.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.920
What do you think?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.640
With that amount,
I could rent four for myself, Mom.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.760
Well, yes.
But, at your age, it is better to share.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.920
Wow, this is lavish, isn't it?
What do you think?

17:38.760 --> 17:41.040
- Hi. Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.080
I thought summer was never going to end.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.600
Me neither.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.640
- What school are you coming from?
- Saint Marie.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.560
- Ah. So are we.
- Really?

17:52.640 --> 17:53.560
Yes. Well, her.

17:55.960 --> 17:56.840
Have you met?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.880
Uh... What? I don't think so.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.600
Well, we got here last year.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.720
We weren't here last year.
We took a sabbatical year.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.080
It was two.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.040
Yeah, two.

18:09.120 --> 18:12.320
She never liked humanities,
and now she wants to study philology.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.240
It's perfect,
isn't it? Shall we keep it?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.080
I love it.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.920
I'm Noah. Pleased to meet you.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.720
Briar. My name is Briar.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.440
Did you want to see me?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.520
Come in, please. Nick, look.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.680
This is Sofía Zabala.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.640
She'll help you with your internship.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.720
She is our new junior recruit,
fresh out of Harvard.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.760
Zabala. Are you the minister's daughter?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.200
I am here on my own merits. How about you?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.240
You were at one of her birthdays
when you were little.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.400
- I don't know if you remember her.
- Uh, no.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.680
I remember her sister
with eyes... like...

19:03.760 --> 19:04.760
Strabismal?

19:04.840 --> 19:07.120
Yes. And one of those old braces, right?

19:07.200 --> 19:08.880
- Yes.
- I don't have any sisters.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.000
She was you.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.440
Two direct hits.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.440
Be careful with her.
She's going to be a great lawyer.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.640
You won't hold it against me, right, Sof?

19:24.480 --> 19:27.600
First, my name is Sofía, not Sof.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.920
Second, I know your reputation,
so don't stare at my ass.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.680
Stuck up.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.720
Hello, Freckles.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.480
So Nick finally has
an apartment, doesn't he?

20:06.640 --> 20:07.960
Yes, so I've heard.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.920
Is it nice?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.520
I wouldn't know. I haven't been there.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.760
Listen.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.960
I know this year was hard for you.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.240
- What Dad did was awful.
- I'm getting burned.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.080
You're leaving for college in two weeks.
I think it's time for you and me to talk.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.360
- I don't want to talk about that.
- But I do.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.800
You know how hard it's been
for me to fit into this family.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.800
You can't imagine the comments
I have to hear 'cause I married Will.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.160
- Sure, Mom.
- They think I'm only after his money.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.440
And now you do this.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.320
Have you been spying on me?

20:43.400 --> 20:46.240
Not me. Some paparazzi.
Thank God Will managed to stop it.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.640
Can you imagine the headlines?

20:47.720 --> 20:50.520
"First the mother, now the daughter,
after the Leisters' money."

20:50.600 --> 20:52.360
And that could make
the holding's stock plummet, right?

20:56.240 --> 20:58.960
I'll be more careful.
But I'm 18. Okay, Mom?

20:59.520 --> 21:01.920
Yes. I was also of age
when I met your father,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.280
when I thought
he was the right person for me.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.640
Nick is not like Dad.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.320
Yeah. I know.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.400
But I think he could hurt you too.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.240
Do you really think he's given up
the illegal fights and races?

21:14.320 --> 21:16.160
- I trust him.
- Oh.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.360
- Because I know he loves me.
- Hmm.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.160
Does he? Are you sure?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.320
And I love him.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.080
Not under my roof.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.440
- Hi.
- It's done.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.800
I told my father
I'm not going back to San Francisco.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.040
- What did he say?
- I think he was expecting it.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.000
Are you sure?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.440
I just don't want you to take
a step backward for me.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.760
Absolutely not.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.440
The only thing is I have to share
my office with another intern.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.920
Is she nice?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.360
Well...

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
And pretty?

22:07.080 --> 22:09.520
No way.
She is crossed-eyed and her feet stink.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.920
Hey, we'll see each other later?

22:13.880 --> 22:15.480
Um, later?

22:15.560 --> 22:18.080
I am busy later. I have to...

22:18.600 --> 22:19.760
I don't think I can.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.000
I have... I have to work.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.480
I have to split up the work.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.560
I'll switch to voice call.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.000
Hey, I miss you.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.400
I miss you too.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.160
My sister.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
I love you.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
Me too.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.160
We are a very close-knit family.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
Noah.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.440
Come on! Everyone out. The party's over!

23:26.520 --> 23:28.280
Scram! Come on! Everybody out!

23:28.360 --> 23:29.640
Here, let me take it.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.880
Leave the glasses here, okay?

23:31.960 --> 23:33.120
Come on! Out!

23:33.640 --> 23:34.560
I'm so sorry.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.320
I didn't have your contact info
to ask for permission.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.360
- It's okay.
- I'm really sorry, okay?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.600
Hey! Off you go. Go fuck in your own home.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.240
Get out. Come on!

23:44.320 --> 23:46.160
I'll pick everything up.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.400
I know this is no excuse, but they told me
you weren't coming until next week.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.920
I know. It's just...

23:56.600 --> 23:58.400
Things have been a bit rushed.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.520
Come on. It's okay.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.040
There you go. Tequila.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.520
I can't see people suffer.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.080
Because life is too wonderful
to waste it on sorrow.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.000
You see,
I have not always thought that way.

24:24.360 --> 24:28.360
Sometimes you find assholes
that make you do crazy stuff.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.520
But, anyway, that was a long time ago,
and it's forgotten now.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.480
Sorry.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.920
Uh... I was looking for my jacket.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.400
- This one?
- Yes.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.560
Thank you.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.520
Are you okay?

24:49.600 --> 24:52.760
Ignore him. He's the neighbor.
He's studying psychology.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.680
I'll just pretend I didn't see that.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.680
Michael.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.560
Noah. Pleased to meet you.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.160
And he's doing
an internship in our college.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.200
As a counselor.
So if you ever need anything...

25:04.800 --> 25:05.840
He's really nice.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.120
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.360
And he looks really nice.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.520
Here. Cheers.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.880
Excuse me. Your ex-wife called again.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.120
It's the fifth time this week.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.840
Today, she asked for Nick.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.280
Don't put her through. You know. Hmm?

25:31.360 --> 25:33.000
- Please.
- All right.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.280
I've reconsidered it.
I'll help with the Ortega case.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.320
Hmm. Too bad. Templeton for me.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.760
Hi, Freckles.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.760
How was the night with the intern?

25:54.840 --> 25:57.320
Well, she's really a tough nut to crack.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.320
And are her feet really stinky?

25:59.400 --> 26:00.520
And her breath.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.240
It seems like you were right.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.880
There is chemistry between them.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.320
You had a really good idea.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.240
- Talk to me, Luca.
- Listen carefully.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.800
There might be an opportunity
to save the garage.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.520
Run! Pass it! Amazing! And now...

26:48.560 --> 26:49.600
Wow! You can do it!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.520
Whoa! Can't you tackle me?

26:51.600 --> 26:54.000
You go right, and I go left, okay?
And that's it.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.520
Ready.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.000
- Sister sandwich!
- Yay!

27:04.280 --> 27:07.320
Tickles! Tickles!

27:17.680 --> 27:19.440
- Bye, my love.
- Bye.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.640
Bye, sweetie.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.920
Go in, sweetie.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
Hi, son.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.080
Let's go.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.560
I need to talk to you.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.880
How dare you use Maggie
to get close to me?

27:38.960 --> 27:41.320
You won't answer my calls.
I have no other option.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.640
- We've nothing to talk about.
- Just a minute.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
"A minute."

27:45.280 --> 27:48.120
That is 60 seconds more
than what you have ever given me.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.800
It's not what you think.
Listen to me, please.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.440
Relax.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.120
I hadn't seen her in years.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.040
How can a mother disappear like that?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.960
Maybe there is something we don't know.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.320
Is it so easy
to forget someone you have loved?

28:24.880 --> 28:26.000
My love.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.880
Where are you going?

29:22.200 --> 29:24.200
I still owe you that kiss, don't I?

29:24.840 --> 29:26.480
You mean--

29:56.440 --> 29:57.960
What is happening here?

29:58.040 --> 30:00.160
Wasn't I supposed
to be taking care of you?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.160
If you want, it's your turn next time.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.120
Hey. No pressure, okay?

30:05.200 --> 30:07.120
I still need to pass the written exam.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.840
I didn't know the masculine G-spot
was called H-spot.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.600
- Do you know why they call it G-spot?
- It's G for "Goddamn." Fuck!

30:13.680 --> 30:16.520
Nicholas Leister,
you know I don't like hickeys.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.720
You have a hickey? Where?

30:18.800 --> 30:22.360
Listen, it's not funny, okay?
I hate being marked. I am not a cow, Nick.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.320
You aren't?

30:23.400 --> 30:26.560
This specimen is property
of Leister Ranch. No way, all right?

30:26.640 --> 30:29.120
Aren't you exaggerating
just a tiny little bit?

30:29.200 --> 30:30.240
You think?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.640
Would you like to be marked?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.880
- You're going to freak out.
- No, okay?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.680
No. No. No. No.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.160
You're going to stay still.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.560
YES, FRECKLES

31:27.920 --> 31:30.560
And this one with permanent marker. Yes.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.240
YOU ARE MINE

31:47.000 --> 31:47.960
Ta-da!

31:49.320 --> 31:50.680
So this is your mansion.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.160
Hey, what's up?
It is not to your liking, milord?

31:53.960 --> 31:56.560
Listen, Lion.
Yes, you have to come see this.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.520
It doesn't smell like posh perfume.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.600
It smells more like a sweaty sock.
I'm about to puke.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.680
I haven't eaten anything the whole trip.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.360
I bet these students don't even
have a sandwich in the fridge.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.840
Exactly what I said,
not even a damn sandwich.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.280
Oh, hi.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.320
Uh, this is my roommate, Briar.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.520
Rick, right?

32:33.640 --> 32:35.440
- Nick.
- That's it. Nick.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.200
It's so late, so...

32:43.280 --> 32:45.080
- Leaving already?
- Yes.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.080
It's your first day of college tomorrow.
You need to sleep.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.240
Okay. Do you want me to call you a cab?

32:50.320 --> 32:52.760
Esteban is picking me up. He's on his way.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.920
Uh, uh...

33:10.440 --> 33:12.440
Something troubling you, sir?

33:15.440 --> 33:16.840
Do you remember Briar?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.040
Briar? Yes, of course.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.320
Poor girl. That wasn't okay.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.280
Where did she end up?

33:26.040 --> 33:28.320
I know, Jenna, but I'm not going
to answer to my mom.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.520
I'll call her later.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.280
It's Lion, sir.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.880
- Fuck, my phone.
- Here.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.480
I have been calling for an hour.
Where are you, bro?

33:49.560 --> 33:50.720
What's wrong?

33:51.280 --> 33:54.880
I fucked up, man. I fucked up, man!

34:06.040 --> 34:07.400
Thank you. You can go home.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.200
- You're bleeding!
- No, it's nothing, Nick.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.520
I cut myself opening this fucking package.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.760
What's this?

34:18.840 --> 34:22.160
My brother told me not to open it
and to bring it to that spot.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.320
But you opened it.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.080
I wanted to make sure that it was
something else.

34:26.160 --> 34:29.280
I don't know,
a package with phones, with caviar--

34:29.360 --> 34:31.480
Caviar? How can you be so dumb?

34:31.560 --> 34:32.560
Give it to me.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.120
No! Don't touch it.

34:34.200 --> 34:35.840
Easy. Nobody will know.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.160
Cocaine.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.920
Shit, I knew it. I fucking knew it!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.280
You're an asshole!

34:44.360 --> 34:46.200
If you needed bread,
why didn't you ask me?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.240
Because I don't want
your charity. I told you.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.360
I have no other option, right?

34:55.400 --> 34:57.520
I have to go in there and deliver it.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.800
Those guys are real gangsters.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.840
I may never come out.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.800
I promised Noah I'd stay out of trouble.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.040
Okay.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.680
See you, bro.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.840
Hi, handsome.
Why don't you buy me a drink?

36:11.400 --> 36:12.560
I'm sorry.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.320
Hey, what are you doing, man?

36:14.920 --> 36:17.720
If my girlfriend wants a drink,
you buy her one. Period.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.240
Okay. I'm not looking for trouble.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.680
Here. Order whatever you want.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.520
I'm going to the bathroom.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.080
He says he's with him.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.720
Hello, bro.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.120
Any other family members or...

36:49.480 --> 36:51.960
Um, excuse me.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.440
I couldn't find you, dude.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.800
Look who we have here.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.160
Nicholas Leister himself
and his little bitch.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
Ronnie?

37:11.480 --> 37:13.600
Sorry, I thought you were the bastard--

37:13.680 --> 37:15.880
- It's his brother.
- What a coincidence.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.440
When I tell Ronnie,
he's going to really enjoy it.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.480
Yeah, I also enjoy remembering him.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
Because he's still in jail, correct?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.560
Maybe you can enjoy his company soon.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.160
They reduced his sentence.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.520
It seems the poor guy was gagged.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.000
He was just another one
of your father's victims.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.560
Like you.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.920
Anyway, if they don't bring him to trial
before a year has passed,

37:40.640 --> 37:42.040
they'll have to let him go.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.200
I'll be here.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.360
In the meantime, let's do business, right?

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
It's open.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
Seriously?

37:55.680 --> 37:57.080
Didn't they tell you not to open it?

37:57.160 --> 37:59.120
The guy who gave it to me
was not a big talker.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.200
There are 100 grams missing.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.560
That's normal.
If everyone wants a taste, in the end...

38:11.640 --> 38:13.760
One hundred grams
was just an example, huh?

38:14.600 --> 38:16.360
Are you saying
we're trying to swindle you?

38:16.440 --> 38:17.800
Depends on the price.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.840
100 grams, 10,000 euros.

38:20.920 --> 38:24.440
- I thought it was coke, not plutonium.
- It's uncut, sunshine.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.120
Wait, what's happening?
I'm not going to get paid?

38:27.200 --> 38:29.520
- I won't leave without my money, okay?
- Relax.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.280
- You will get what you deserve.
- Let's all calm down, okay?

38:34.360 --> 38:37.280
- The ATM will only give me 3,000.
- I don't want your money.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.280
But I do. Three from you...

38:40.640 --> 38:41.600
and three from her.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.960
March, ladies.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.640
Who can take care of them for 6,000 euros?

38:51.720 --> 38:55.000
Dude, for that bread, I'll do it myself.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.080
Go.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.160
Hey, handsome. Where were you?
I ordered you a gin and tonic.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.880
So you see my girl is legit.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.280
Um... It doesn't have cucumber.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.480
It doesn't have cucumber.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.080
No. It was for me,
and I want it with cucumber.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.000
She wants it with cucumber.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.680
I won't allow you to hurt my man.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.640
Much less call me a bitch.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.640
No way, Sof. We cannot accept that.

41:02.720 --> 41:06.240
They didn't find the drugs.
So, if you don't talk, neither will they.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.560
- They wanted to fucking kill us.
- Let it be.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.840
If it's just a fight, I'll get you out
this afternoon. I promise.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.000
- Good morning, Sofía.
- Good morning, boss.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.640
Don't let my father find out, please.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.520
You owe me one.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.040
Thank you, Sof. For real.

41:26.560 --> 41:28.040
- Hey, coming up?
- Yes.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.160
Yes?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.800
The police were really nice.
They brought us to our car.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.800
Juan Luis and Paula. Right?

41:40.840 --> 41:41.880
Come on, Freckles.

41:42.360 --> 41:45.200
Nick's gang
against Ronnie's gang. Seriously?

41:45.280 --> 41:46.760
I told you this was Luca's doing.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.960
So that's how you make the money
for your races.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.240
I'm not a fool. I don't need the money.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.480
No, you do it for the fun of it.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.520
- That was low.
- I am really fucking pissed.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.560
I missed my first day of college.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.920
You do realize
you started the fight, don't you?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.080
- Did you have a better plan?
- No, no. I'm just surprised.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.520
I collect contradictions.

42:11.120 --> 42:14.960
Do you think it doesn't fucking hurt me?
They could have killed you, Nick.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.080
They can't get me away
from you that easily.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.600
Loving you is
the hardest thing I've ever done.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.960
Loving you is the most beautiful thing
I've ever done.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.800
You're a brownnoser.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.760
Why did you bring me here?

42:38.840 --> 42:41.320
Because now it's your turn
to save someone's life.

42:43.160 --> 42:47.240
ANIMAL SHELTER

42:48.640 --> 42:52.280
Do you really think this is a good idea?
I'm more a dog person than a cat person.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.360
- Don't say that in front of N.
- N?

42:55.120 --> 42:57.640
Yes. N from Noah, N from Nick.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.120
- That's so cheesy.
- Tough luck.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.640
- Ciao, Michael.
- Ciao, Noah.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.440
He's Briar's friend.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.040
Listen, does this Briar
know about the cat?

43:10.120 --> 43:11.920
Yes, she loves animals.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.400
- She doesn't look like it.
- So what's your issue with her?

43:15.480 --> 43:18.800
- Nothing. She just gives me bad vibes.
- Sure.

43:18.880 --> 43:22.040
Because she's the first girl who doesn't
make eyes at you, and you can't stand it?

43:23.080 --> 43:25.960
No, that's not it.
We just don't know her and...

43:26.760 --> 43:28.120
Why? Did she say something?

43:28.200 --> 43:31.080
She just told me she had
a car accident with her boyfriend

43:31.160 --> 43:33.320
in an illegal race, so maybe you know him.

43:33.400 --> 43:36.280
No. No, it must have been
when I lived in Mexico.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.560
He was driving.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.560
She was in the hospital for two months

43:40.640 --> 43:42.760
and, when she got out,
he had another girl.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.800
Can you imagine? What a douche.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.760
Now that you mention it,
it does sound familiar.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.600
Like she went crazy
and started to stalk him.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.480
Uh, she didn't tell me that.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.360
What I do know is that he disappeared,
as if the earth had swallowed him up.

44:06.760 --> 44:07.840
I'm not coming in.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.520
She's not here, okay?
She's at a Pilates class.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.200
Which means we have an hour
for just the two of us.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.760
I don't want to fuck, really.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.800
You use a lot of swear words, you know?

44:19.880 --> 44:22.640
- Because I'm an ex-convict now.
- Ah, really?

44:22.720 --> 44:23.840
Yes.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.280
And when was the last time
you touched a woman?

44:27.880 --> 44:29.080
No, no. no, no.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.520
Do you know I was in France?

44:35.360 --> 44:38.360
Hmm. Do you want to know
what I learned there?

44:39.960 --> 44:44.680
Mm, Mr. Nick Leister.
I love you, my love.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.600
I love you too.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.440
Show me your baguette.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.560
Yes. Yes.

45:44.880 --> 45:46.520
Don't stop on my account, okay?

45:46.600 --> 45:49.400
I bought this shirt
and wanted to cut the label.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.600
Christ, that was scary.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.920
- Hey, what she had on her wrist was...
- Yes.

46:00.960 --> 46:04.360
That guy must have done something more
than just dump her because...

46:04.440 --> 46:05.840
Fuck!

46:05.920 --> 46:07.320
Careful. Damn it.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.320
Little one.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.520
Listen.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.640
Why don't you help me
find furniture for my apartment?

46:13.720 --> 46:18.400
You can come with N and stay until...
I mean, as long as you need.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.000
As long as I need.

46:21.080 --> 46:24.440
Okay, fine. You can stay for the whole
school year. I really don't mind.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.760
Thank God you don't mind.

46:27.440 --> 46:32.320
Nick, I haven't yet gathered the strength
to go home and grab all my stuff,

46:32.400 --> 46:35.720
and I wanted to do it this week,
so don't mess with my plans, okay?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.240
You're really something, Freckles.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.880
Nick.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.560
The cat.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.360
There you go.

46:50.600 --> 46:51.600
He's so mean.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.880
First, he hurts your paw,
and then he forgets you even exist.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.320
I'm so glad you're with me in linguistics.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.000
I cannot stand the professor!

47:04.520 --> 47:06.200
I don't know. I like him.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.480
Do you know what major you'll choose?

47:09.560 --> 47:12.160
Uh, no, not yet. I have doubts.

47:12.720 --> 47:14.160
Michael is fully booked,

47:15.400 --> 47:17.400
but I'm sure he'll find a spot for you

47:19.080 --> 47:22.760
Anyway, think it through and let me know.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.640
- This is your chance.
- See you next week.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.520
Hi. Can I help you?

47:29.600 --> 47:31.320
- Um, no.
- Only her.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.040
I'll see you later at home.

47:34.600 --> 47:35.600
Come in.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.680
Jenna?

47:42.760 --> 47:45.040
I thought you'd take longer
to recognize me.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.360
Noah let me borrow her clothes.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.080
- What are you doing here?
- Do you like my new look?

47:50.800 --> 47:52.320
I'm not wearing anything underneath.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.760
You're not wearing underwear?

47:54.480 --> 47:57.920
Yes, but I'm not wearing anything
under my underwear.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.800
I really wanted to say that.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.720
Since they let you go,
you haven't left the garage.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.440
Jenna, forgive me for... I'm sorry.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.520
I know.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.800
I know, but promise you won't do
any more dumb stuff for money.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.000
- Okay.
- Please.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.080
Mm-hmm.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.120
- No races either.
- No, none.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.080
Lion, I don't want to lose you.

48:32.040 --> 48:35.240
Wait. Let's do that later.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.160
I brought a romantic dinner.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.680
Caviar for starters.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.320
And, to finish up, oysters

48:47.400 --> 48:51.800
and an Olivier,
the best French champagne.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.240
Your mother has a sister
who looks just like her.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.360
Hi, Noah!

48:58.440 --> 49:00.760
Hey, do you have a visitor?
I won't bother you.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.160
No, she came to see you.

49:08.040 --> 49:11.240
- Anabel, it's been a pleasure to meet you.
- Same thing, sweetie.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.960
You have my phone if you need me.

49:13.880 --> 49:14.920
Ciao.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.880
It's a small world.
I actually know her parents and then--

49:17.960 --> 49:19.200
What are you doing here?

49:20.640 --> 49:22.680
Maggie tells me great things about you.

49:22.760 --> 49:26.360
Listen, if this is about Nick,
just talk to him, all right?

49:27.920 --> 49:30.640
I have tried everything, Noah.
You're my last chance.

49:34.280 --> 49:35.480
Let's do one thing.

49:35.560 --> 49:39.360
As proof of good faith, I'll let Maggie
spend a whole week with Nick.

49:39.440 --> 49:41.000
That's blackmail.

49:41.080 --> 49:44.600
Sweetie, you had better pray
you don't have to see me blackmail anyone.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.280
Now it's a threat.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.840
You're clever, Noah. Think about it.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.120
Nick needs help.

49:51.160 --> 49:53.480
Are you sure
you don't want to know the truth?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.600
I only care about Nick's truth.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.600
Because the Leisters never lie, right?

49:58.240 --> 50:01.920
By the way, do you know how long your mom
and Will have known each other?

50:05.960 --> 50:07.720
Call me when you're ready.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.760
Hi, Morti, you're very elegant
for a Tuesday, aren't you?

50:19.840 --> 50:23.360
- Can you help me with the boxes?
- I'm sorry, Noah. I can't right now.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.480
Noah.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.680
Hi, Noah! Come in.

50:48.760 --> 50:53.320
Look, this is Alejo Zabala, his wife,
Maite, and their daughter, Sofía,

50:55.280 --> 50:56.760
Nick's office mate.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.360
Pleased to meet you.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.880
So you're the one with stinky feet.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.280
And breath.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.320
I can see you also have sweaty hands.

51:12.400 --> 51:13.480
A pleasure.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.920
I'm sorry. She got us out of trouble.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.160
I had to return the favor.

51:21.240 --> 51:23.960
You're not staying for dinner,
are you, darling?

51:25.680 --> 51:28.600
And then Nick chose the Ortega case

51:28.680 --> 51:30.760
because he thought
it was the Ortegas in A Coruña.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.000
Seriously.

51:32.080 --> 51:35.000
Sofía had the advantage, didn't she?

51:35.080 --> 51:37.880
No, Sofía,
tell them about the arsonist, please.

51:37.960 --> 51:41.960
We decided to build a small scale model
of the explosive device.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.560
Sofía thought that,
instead of us having to prove

51:44.640 --> 51:47.360
that the device worked,
they had to prove that it didn't.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.440
In legal jargon, it's known
as shifting the burden of proof.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.440
Precisely.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.040
And Sofía whispers, "Shift the burden."
And, of course, what did I do?

51:57.080 --> 52:01.160
He changed the terminals
in the battery and it exploded.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.720
He shifted the burden!

52:04.720 --> 52:06.560
I was very nervous. It was our first case.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.440
The day they work together
on something serious,

52:09.520 --> 52:11.160
they're going to be unstoppable.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.840
Work together or whatever else happens.

52:16.800 --> 52:17.760
Sorry.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.880
Uh, hey, Will, can you imagine?

52:20.960 --> 52:23.680
- What would that make us? In-laws, right?
- Yes.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.400
- In-laws!
- Precisely.

52:26.960 --> 52:30.080
Well, come on. There's no hurry.
Let's not pressure them, okay?

52:30.160 --> 52:31.760
Let them go at their own pace.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.880
And you, Noah, how's school?

52:34.520 --> 52:37.040
- College. I'm in college now.
- Ah.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.400
How is it to work for the city council?

52:40.480 --> 52:42.840
He's the Minister of Justice now, my dear.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.280
Oh, congratulations.

52:46.440 --> 52:48.920
Do you remember
the university dorms?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.960
The good old times.

52:51.040 --> 52:54.040
No, back then...

52:54.120 --> 52:55.200
Shut up!

52:55.280 --> 52:57.160
I'm living in a university apartment,

52:57.240 --> 52:59.360
but Nick wants me to go live with him.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.280
What do you think about that, Mom?

53:14.480 --> 53:16.680
What the hell is wrong with your daughter?

53:17.520 --> 53:19.160
The kidnapping was a year ago.

53:22.240 --> 53:26.040
Excuse her,
her father died a year ago today.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.160
Wow, shit.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.080
Yes, and she hasn't stopped
having nightmares ever since.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.360
Nightmares?

53:32.040 --> 53:33.440
I've never noticed anything.

53:33.520 --> 53:36.240
Do you sleep with her?

53:41.040 --> 53:42.760
They're a very close-knit family.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.640
I'm so dumb.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
I forgot.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.200
It's okay.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.120
You had
other things on your mind.

54:07.880 --> 54:10.120
Noah, that's not true.
It really isn't true.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.800
Our parents have set us up.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.160
You think this is normal?

54:14.240 --> 54:16.360
Sofía is just an obnoxious social climber.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.080
Yeah, I saw her climb
all the way to nibble your ear.

54:19.160 --> 54:21.680
She was telling me
how good you and I are together.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.040
- Sure.
- Why don't you trust me?

54:24.120 --> 54:25.280
I trust you.

54:25.360 --> 54:28.840
I don't doubt that she was cross-eyed
and knock-kneed when she was 12.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.760
I wanted to spare you the jealousy.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.560
Thank you so much, huh? Thank God.

54:32.640 --> 54:35.920
You make me look like a baby in front
of her, as if I needed protection.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.160
No, it doesn't matter. They're right.
You make a great couple.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.680
There's nothing between us.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.760
Listen, I really mean it, Nick Leister.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.200
One more lie, and it's over.

54:46.680 --> 54:49.680
So, if you have anything to confess to me,
the moment is now.

54:52.320 --> 54:53.480
There is nothing else.

54:58.880 --> 54:59.920
You know?

55:00.000 --> 55:03.800
With every lie you just prove to me
that you're the one who doesn't trust me.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.560
It's as if you always needed an excuse
to keep your distance.

55:11.680 --> 55:14.280
Deep inside, you don't want me
to come live with you.

55:14.360 --> 55:16.040
- Noah, you know I love you.
- Yeah.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.680
My father also loved me once.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.920
YOUR ABSENCE WILL FOLLOW ME WHILE I SLEEP

55:29.440 --> 55:32.040
You got the tattoo
with the knot because of him?

55:32.800 --> 55:33.800
Why?

55:33.880 --> 55:35.080
He tried to kill you.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.200
You did it for your mother, didn't you?

55:39.200 --> 55:40.600
Why, if she abandoned you?

55:42.600 --> 55:44.000
You know?

55:46.440 --> 55:48.520
When you tie someone up too tight,

55:49.440 --> 55:53.080
they either get hurt trying to break free
or remain trapped forever.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.560
What are we doing, Nick?

56:02.120 --> 56:04.160
Do we stay tied up in our knots

56:04.240 --> 56:07.720
or do we face the truth
even though it might hurt us?

56:12.080 --> 56:14.560
I'm fed up
with having other people decide for me.

56:16.120 --> 56:17.240
It's over.

56:18.520 --> 56:22.240
I'm going to be brave
and find out what is happening to us.

56:48.200 --> 56:51.000
- Relax. There's nobody here.
- So many works of art.

56:52.360 --> 56:55.520
Thor! My dear! Did you miss me?

56:55.600 --> 56:57.960
Do they have you
taking care of the museum?

56:58.040 --> 56:59.600
It might be better if I go.

57:00.360 --> 57:01.840
Don't worry. I'll wait here.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.760
The drawer in the middle
has a false bottom.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.600
You'll see the lawsuit
where I asked for Nick's custody.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.360
ANABEL GRASON SEEKS CUSTODY
OF NICHOLAS LEISTER

57:21.440 --> 57:26.320
And the withdrawal they made me sign
after the blackmail, of course.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.240
You don't know Grandpa Andrew
and his legion of lawyers.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.800
He hates his son, Will,
because he's not like him,

57:31.880 --> 57:33.800
but his grandson is a different story.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.000
He's his heir.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.360
He would never
have allowed me to take him.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.200
Yes, I was unfaithful
to Will and my new husband.

57:41.280 --> 57:44.760
Grandpa found out
and used it to take Nick away from me.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.040
It's unfair...

57:46.800 --> 57:50.440
because before that, Will was already
having an affair with your mother.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.840
It's such a shame
I didn't find out earlier.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.920
"Anti-wrinkle," so cheap.

58:45.640 --> 58:48.640
Pink toothbrush. White toothbrush.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.360
PHOTO

59:31.680 --> 59:32.960
Ready?

59:37.600 --> 59:39.080
Did you find everything?

59:41.080 --> 59:42.440
The truth always hurts.

59:43.160 --> 59:46.240
Believe me, I fought
for Nick's custody with all I had.

59:47.240 --> 59:50.760
I just want you to give him this letter.
Everything is explained there.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.760
I don't know what's worse,

59:52.840 --> 59:55.160
that he hates you
or that he hates his family.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.200
That is his decision to make.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.120
If he finds out I helped you,
he will never forgive me.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.160
You don't have to give it to him, Noah.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.480
Just make sure he finds it and reads it.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.360
What ice cream do you want?

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.320
Her parents.
Do you know they're getting a divorce?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
What?

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.240
Her father has hired Roca as his lawyer.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.880
He told me.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.680
They're going to crush Anabel.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.640
Be careful. I'm sure she's scheming. Hmm?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.360
Sofía! Today is your lucky day.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.200
- Jenkins is in surgery. Peritonitis.
- Poor thing.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.920
The Rogers case is lost,
but it will teach you a lot.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.120
The black one, please.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.320
- When is the hearing?
- Day after tomorrow.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.120
You have 48 hours to prepare.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.240
- But it's in London?
- Yes.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.200
It would be your first big case.
What do you say?

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.760
You can count on me.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.960
Hello.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.120
Hi, Freckles.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.680
How are you? What are you doing here?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.240
Nothing. I wanted to see Maggie
before she left.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.800
She went out for ice cream with Esteban.
Can you give me five minutes?

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.600
What is that?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.760
It's my mother's handwriting.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.920
Who brought this?

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.560
- Uh...
- A messenger just gave it to me.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.840
I left it on the table.
It must have fallen.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.600
Do you want me to read it?

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.480
It must be important, Nick.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.040
Do me a favor.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.880
Get rid of it.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.680
You look very pretty.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.040
I didn't know blue roses existed.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.600
- It wasn't necessary.
- Yes, it was.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.400
After the ambush the other day
with the minister,

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.960
I owed you a romantic dinner.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.240
As long as no confetti falls from the sky.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.320
There is a surprise, but it's not that.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.040
What is it?

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.280
YOU ARE MINE

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.120
- No.
- Yes.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.400
- Don't fuck with me.
- What is it? You don't like it?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.160
You thought I was going to like it?

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.400
I wasn't letting
your love letter disappear.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.720
Well, that and that it was
a permanent pen.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.400
But a tattoo is for life, Nick.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.760
It's crazy, really.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.320
- You'll be sorry.
- I didn't do anything new, Noah.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.240
I've had you tattooed on my skin
for a long time.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.720
I want to be honest with you.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.680
We're going to London for a few days.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.960
"We?"

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.280
Sofía and I.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.360
Everyone thinks
the case is lost, but if we win,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.200
it might open up many doors for us.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.800
I'm really happy for both of you.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.840
I have been thinking and...
maybe honesty is overrated.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.000
Some truths are just too complicated.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.680
I agree with you.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.040
You think being an adult
is doing whatever you want,

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.360
but it actually means
to know what you have to do.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.200
Promise you'll stay here
until I come back.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.240
You know? I have a weird feeling.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.800
As if this were a goodbye.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.320
I'm only going for a few days.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040
Yeah.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.720
So, why did you tear up the letter?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.480
Because I don't want to know anything.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:27.640
I thought you were going to accompany me
in untying our knots.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.800
It's my decision,
and you have to respect it.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.200
I guess it's for the best.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.640
Hi, Mom.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.160
So this is the apartment.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.800
Will always says that all a Leister needs
is a safe and a pull-up bar.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.520
I was only staying for a few days.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.960
At the dinner with the minister,
you crossed a red line I won't tolerate.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.000
You don't know how hard it is
to manage emotions

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080
when you have to hide them from others.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.480
Or do you?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.360
I've tried not to meddle
in your relationship with Nick--

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.480
Bullshit!

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.160
You sent him to San Francisco
for a whole year to keep us apart.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.120
That's not true.
It was just a coincidence.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.320
Sure, as coincidental
as the trip we took to Europe

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.440
when Nick was coming home
for a few days, right?

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.120
You even sent him to London
with Sofía. Well played.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.960
Maybe this time it will work.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.720
I don't care. I won't let you live
with someone at 18.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.760
I didn't say I would,
but it's my life, Mom.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.520
You have to let me make my own mistakes.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.520
Perfect. But if you do,
forget about university.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.440
Now you're the manager
of William's money.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.880
And you will sacrifice your future?
Do you think he'd do the same for you?

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.440
I don't know.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.040
Noah, I have always believed in you,
since you were a child,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.920
since I took you in my arms
to that hospital

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.240
while you were bleeding out.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.520
I saw strength in your eyes.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.560
That will to live told me you'd always
achieve everything you wanted.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.000
I only had to give you opportunities.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.320
Tell me where I've failed you,
what I've done wrong.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.880
- Can you explain it to me?
- Can you explain to me where you were...

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.200
that night while my father
was stabbing me with a knife?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.120
Who were you sleeping with
at a luxury hotel, Mom?

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.800
I know how much you suffered with Dad.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.000
That's why I've never wanted to hurt you.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.120
But now that I know this,
I feel free to love whoever I want.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.440
Unconditionally.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.880
Some paparazzi took photos of you?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.920
Yes, Granddad. It sucks.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.560
Noah prefers to avoid public places.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.880
In the end, you end up meeting less often.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.800
I love it when you tell me things.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.040
That woman is perfect.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.880
And you wouldn't have to hide.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.600
Granddad, I wanted to talk to you
about one thing.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.880
Do you remember Briar?

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.880
I took care of her,
so she wouldn't bother you again.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.400
- Forget her.
- Something else happened, didn't it?

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.480
Why did you ask me
to disappear for a while?

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.680
Look, Nick, one day,
when you are in charge of the corporation,

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.080
you'll have to deal with all the trouble.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.600
But, until then, let me take care of this.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.400
If there's anything else, I want to know.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.400
Briar was committed for two years.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.440
She wasn't well before she met you.
So don't torture yourself.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.160
It has nothing to do with you.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.760
Are you still in the apartme

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.680
Still in my grandfather's apartment?

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.000
Yes

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.720
Take care of N

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.800
Noah! I'm cooking a stew.
Would you like some?

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.720
No, thanks. I already ate.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.120
- Great. I'll leave some in a Tupperware.
- Okay.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.000
Wow.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.480
It looks like Nick has her
wrapped around his finger,

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.200
doesn't he, little one?

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.680
That's how he is.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.760
One word and he puts you on cloud nine...

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.600
or buried five meters underground.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.120
But we won't let him win. Right, Briar?

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.840
It's us who ought to bury him
five meters underground.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.920
No, please.
Not another dinner with our parents.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.440
- Poor Noah.
- She was so jealous.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.360
Hey, is it true you asked her to live
with you even though she's only 18?

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.640
Maybe you're the one who's jealous.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.600
Come on, Sof. I'm not
your typical controlling boyfriend.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.240
I'm just saying that having you
as a boyfriend would be last on my list.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.360
Yeah, because you're an iceberg,
pretty girl.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.760
The only thing you're capable of loving
is your job.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.040
You're an idiot.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.000
- Sorry, I just wanted to mess with you.
- Sure.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.440
I know that's not how you are.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.480
Listen, Nick, do you love Noah?

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.440
Madly.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.080
Look, Nick, a piece of advice.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.360
At least with Noah,
try not to do things without thinking.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.640
In my experience,
when you have a relationship

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.440
that so many people want to destroy,
it usually doesn't end up well.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.960
The sentence.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.120
- No.
- Yes!

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.920
- Yes?
- Yes!

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.840
Where's the champagne?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:09.880
Noah!

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.800
Come on! Go.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.360
Three! The boys win.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.120
Very good. Then the boys get to drink.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.400
- Not him.
- No?

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.320
- No.
- He's underage.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.560
Yes.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.400
- Listen.
- He wants to.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.160
Oh, my God. Everything is spinning.
Well, I'm going to bed.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.520
- No.
- I can't believe you.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.520
I'm exhausted.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.560
- N holds up better than you.
- Ciao.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.680
- Do you know how to get there?
- Hey, shut up.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.680
- Don't get lost.
- Hey, screw you.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.800
She's going to get lost.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.840
She's really drunk, my goodness.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.320
Well, she'll find her way.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.840
Oh, God.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.440
Everything is spinning for me too.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.440
Oof.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.640
If I close my eyes, I get really dizzy...

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.240
So, let's leave it
for another day.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.720
- Sure.
- All right.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.320
It was fun.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.640
Yes. You and Briar
are a very funny pair.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.440
I laughed a lot. And I needed it.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.640
I'm glad.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.680
See you on Tuesday.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.200
All right.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.320
Are you Nick?

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.600
Michael. Pleased to meet you.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.240
Excuse me.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.600
What was that moment?

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.600
- What moment?
- That moment.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.760
There was no moment.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.440
You'll see him on Tuesday?

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.160
He's the school counselor,
and he's helping me to find an internship.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.800
I want to quit the restaurant.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.560
So what were you doing? Updating your CV?

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.560
Lower your voice. Briar is sleeping.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.440
You promised you'd stay in the apartment.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.800
I argued with my mother,
and I didn't feel comfortable.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.200
And I find you with this guy.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.280
I argued with my mother!
Do you give a shit?

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.280
We won the case. Do you give a shit?

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.520
- I argue with my father too, okay?
- About business.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.120
I'm the one who is
under pressure for us not to be together.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.480
They treat you like a god, including
offering you Sofía on a silver platter.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.080
"Silver platter."

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.400
Sof is going to laugh.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.320
You laugh a lot together, right?
You and Sof.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.880
Look, Nick, I have been thinking,
and I think we should take a break.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.360
Let's see if I understand
this space-time loop.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.360
That moment earlier
has turned into a break now?

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.480
We are constantly lying to each other.
You don't trust me, and I don't trust you.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.880
And we don't even have fun anymore.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.280
You have been drinking. Sleep it off.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.720
Yeah, right?
It's better to ignore what I'm saying.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.760
Do you want me to write it down for you
or will you tear that up too?

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.080
Nick, I mean it.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.160
This is not working. We're growing apart.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.520
I have been offered a position in London.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.520
In London.
Congratulations.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.080
I have a week to answer.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.440
So you have a week to make up your mind.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
An ultimatum.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.200
Awesome.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.360
The annual company gala is in a week,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.440
so if you decide to come this time,
we'll talk there.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.160
We'll talk there.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.760
What are you wearing, dude?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.640
What's wrong? You've never seen me
in my work clothes before?

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.800
These are what my work clothes look like.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.240
What brings you here?

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.600
I'm not sleeping very well lately.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.520
- What's wrong? Rich kid problems?
- Hey, I'm here, all right?

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.080
Thank you for honoring me
with your presence. Thanks.

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.840
And you got Noah and me in that mess.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.920
That's why the young master
doesn't answer my calls?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.280
I'm not in a good place with Noah,
and I don't want any trouble.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.160
Am I a bad influence on you?

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.280
Go back to your bubble then.
I wouldn't want to get it dirty.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.480
This is Italian.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.080
What's wrong? The garage is sinking.
I can't make ends meet.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.360
And I have to keep up
with my millionaire girlfriend.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.160
I can't take it anymore!

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.000
When I was in Mexico without
a fucking cent, you helped me out.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.000
- Why don't you let me help you now?
- No, bro.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.800
I helped you get back on your feet.
You did the rest.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.800
And that is what I want to do too.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320
Hey. Hey.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.440
Ooh!

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.360
- Hey, bro?
- Not another race.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.920
Come on, brother.
It will be the last one. I swear to you.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.960
- Jenna will kill you.
- No, because I have it all figured out.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.880
The race is the night of the gala, right?

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.640
So, while Noah and Jenna get ready,
primp, put on their make-up,

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.720
we get ready and leave with some excuse.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.160
We race, and we get back there
before the photocall, bro. Flawless.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160
We?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.240
Me and my best friend.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.360
No fucking way.
Besides, I don't have a car.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.440
- Ask Mikel to lend it to you.
- I'll pass.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.400
I heard Ronnie is running too.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.800
He's getting out that same day.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:41.360
You haven't seen that son of a bitch
since he kidnapped Noah.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.080
Tell me you don't want
to send him back to prison.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.720
The sketch with the distribution
of the tables... Don't forget it.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.440
Can you help me with this, please?

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.440
- Yes, come in.
- Hey, ma'am. Ma'am.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.920
There is no way
to make this wrinkle go away.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.920
No, one more wrinkle makes no difference.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.480
I didn't mean you, all right?

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.680
Hi.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.800
Wow. What's with that tuxedo?

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.080
Ooh.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.480
Uh, I borrowed it from Nick.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.120
So you do accept gifts from him?

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.440
You look very nice.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.120
So do you.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.120
Hey, we're going to head out.
We have to stop by Nick's apartment.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.840
Yeah, I forgot my wallet.
See you at the gala, okay?

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.680
Ciao.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.640
I missed you at the pool hall.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.360
- It didn't work out well for you.
- What are you dealing in now?

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.840
Tuxedos?

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.240
He doesn't make enough at the garage
to bring his mom over from Mexico.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.320
And business is
going great for you.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.120
Where is the money
Noah's father promised you

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.680
if you helped him kidnap her?

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.800
Nick, you don't mind if I race
with your old car, do you?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.240
- Enjoy it.
- Hmm?

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.520
It might be the last time
you use it in years.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.240
Chill, okay? We came here to race.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.920
As soon as we're all here,
we'll set the rules.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.360
We're all here.
The sooner this is over, the better.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.800
We're missing a racer.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.400
No fucking way.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.120
Look at them. Asshole number one
and asshole number two.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.880
Well, you know the circuit.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.080
- You know how this works.
- Hi, guys.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.640
The winner will take
15,000 euros plus bets.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.400
Would you like to bet again, Ronnie?

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.880
With you, always.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.880
You must make a complete circuit
and return to the finish line.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.040
It's very dangerous.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.680
And you love danger, don't you, Nick?
You're always playing with fire.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.360
We are ready
to cut off the streets,

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.440
but remember, if the police show up,
you're on your own.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.400
And there is only money
if you finish the race.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.080
Good luck and may the best one win.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.320
Hi, sweetie pie.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.560
How did you find out about the race?

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.360
I put my naked butt on that hood.
Did you think I wouldn't realize?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.840
Do you know how many months
I have to work in the garage

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.720
to make what I'll make here?

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.560
Sorry, asshole number two.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.600
But if someone
is going to win the race, it's us.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.360
Leave that there.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.040
- What's up? How are you?
- Fine. They're about to start.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.320
Shit.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.080
Accelerate! Accelerate!

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.040
All right, girls.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.920
Girls! The joke was fun,
but that's enough.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.760
Do you think we're here for you guys?

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.240
Please don't fuck this up.
I need Lion to win.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.160
I'm sorry. I'm very competitive.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.920
And me, as a capitalist copilot,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.360
I don't want to lose the 1,000 euros
from the entry fee.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.000
They told me you don't know
the difference between coke and caviar.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.880
I'll just leave you to your things, boys.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.520
Police? There are some crazy people
racing illegally.

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.200
- Shit. Someone snitched on us.
- Fuck.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.720
Police. Open all the roadblocks. Open.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.360
15,000 plus the bets, right?
Is that what our relationship is worth?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.800
- Fucking proud brat.
- I'm losing my focus, Jenna!

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.360
That too?

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.680
What the fuck are you doing?

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.600
Shit!

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.400
Reject - Message - Accept

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.640
The streets are meant to be cut off.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.360
Leave before there's an accident.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.240
Would it be your first accident, Nick?

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.360
Freckles

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.680
He and a redhead
had a car crash years ago.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.160
I'll tell you the story one day.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.040
Yeah.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.680
Units two and four,
cut through the next street.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.920
You're in control, huh, blondie?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.240
You owe me a foot massage.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.680
Damn, girl. Shit.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.200
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.040
Fuck!

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.760
Fuck! Fuck!

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.080
Let's go.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.440
I'm coming for you, blondie.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
- Are you okay?
- Yes, just chilling.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.480
Really?

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400
Stop, police. Stop the car!

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.040
You're not angry
with me anymore, right?

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.400
No. Angry. Why?

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.480
Well, can you move? I need to pass. Huh?

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.600
- No fucking way.
- He's nuts.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.240
Stop! Stop the car.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.280
- Nothing. They don't fucking listen. Go.
- I'm using the nitro.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.520
Come on, ladies, please. Stop the vehicle.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.640
Come on. Drop it, please.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240
Fuck, the nitro.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.560
Let's go!

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.760
INCOMING CALL
FRECKLES

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.160
Asshole number one,
you know why we're here, don't you?

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800
We'll never have
an opportunity like this one.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.320
Let's make the best of it then,
little sister.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.680
Sister sandwich!

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.320
Hey! What are you doing?

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.160
What are they doing?

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.240
Hey! Hey!

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.280
Get off, fucker.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.360
Fuck, my car.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.120
No! No!

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.880
Slow down!

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.440
We must leave
before the rest of the police arrive.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.520
- Everybody out! Out! Everyone!
- Move! Move!

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.720
Nice one, brother.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.760
Out you go. Come on!

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.560
Get up!

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.000
Better to have it towed away.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.480
- Welcome, Greg.
- Thank you.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:35.760
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.280
Mr. Tavish.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.680
How are you, Lion?
Have you thought about my offer?

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.360
Let's go, Dad.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.840
Thank you for inviting me.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.280
Smile for the cameras.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.160
There's a bastard out there who's going
to really suffer if he sees you.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.400
I hope so.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.200
Nick, over here!

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.720
Sofía, please.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.600
A smile, please.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.760
- Jenna, listen to me.
- Leave me alone. I've been a fool.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.560
You have always made me feel guilty
for having money.

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.280
- You and your stupid inferiority complex.
- You're right.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.760
But something really weird
happened in that race.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.440
I won, and I didn't feel anything, Jenna.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.880
Do you know what I feel, Lion?

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.400
That you don't love me for who I am.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.080
You cannot separate my money
from the person I am.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.120
You're not listening, Jenna.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.640
I won 15,000 euros, and I felt nothing.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.960
I don't feel anything either.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.760
It's over, Lion.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.000
We're done.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.960
When you do things
like that, that's what happens.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.920
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.120
I never actually thanked you
for the letter in the office.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.120
I didn't even remember.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.560
- Congratulations on the Rogers case.
- Thank you.

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.120
I still can't believe it.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.560
And you're going to London?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.800
Yes. I am.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.120
Enjoy it, okay?

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.000
What the hell are you doing here?

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.440
I always wanted you
to bring me to the gala, love.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.040
Hey, Nick. How are you?

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.880
Why didn't you?

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.000
We only dated for a few months
three years ago.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.680
It's pointless for you to chase me.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.960
You are so charming.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.240
It will be a pleasure, Mr. Tavish.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.960
I hope so.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.400
I knew you'd come with her.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.840
I couldn't say no. Her father asked me.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.520
I didn't expect you'd come with Briar.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.560
I couldn't say no either.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.640
The week is already over.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.360
- The day doesn't end until midnight.
- Yeah.

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.880
Are you going to London with Sofía?

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.560
I have until 12:00 to decide.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.120
You also have time to catch up with Briar.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.000
That's why I brought her along.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.720
You're old friends, aren't you?

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.960
By the way, she told me
how the story ended with that boy.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.720
Really heavy stuff.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.360
I'll reserve a dance for you at midnight.

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.600
I'm going to leave the garage
to my brother.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.440
Jenna's father offered me
a position at the oil company.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.320
And, so, I will have to start
from the bottom.

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.680
Welcome to the Contradiction Club.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.880
If I have to swim in a pool of money
in order to be with Jenna...

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.760
I'll make the sacrifice.

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.400
Good evening, everyone.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.320
Welcome to this year's gala.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.080
Who would have thought?

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.120
Fifty years since Grandpa Andrew
founded his first law firm in London,

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.160
then came the insurance company,
the consultancy, and the rest is history.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.160
So we can go sit down,

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.600
and I advise you
not to move from your seat

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.800
because tonight
is going to be full of surprises.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.040
Isn't that Briar?

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.920
What is she doing here?

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.720
Stop. I can do it by myself.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600
Ah, my favorite granddaughter.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.680
Hey, excuse me, aren't you--

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.840
To the right, man.
It's always through the door on the right.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.120
So where's your friend?

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.400
Surprise!

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.480
Call security.

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.120
I'll leave you alone.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.440
You didn't want to listen to me
the easy way.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.000
Get out.

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.600
Nick, calm down. Calm down.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.680
Calm down.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.200
Say whatever you have to
through our lawyers.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.920
I know your game,
and I won't leave you time to plot

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.640
and hide everything from Nick again.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.640
Let's go to the garden. You and I alone.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.800
It's either all of us or no one.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.400
Don't even dream about it.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.800
Then let's talk here.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.120
Nick, you need to know
I didn't leave your father.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.800
There was another woman then.
Wasn't there, Rafaella?

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800
You had already met?

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.280
Nick! Nick!

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.400
I wanted you to stay with me,
but your grandfather prevented it.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.240
- Don't listen to her!
- Enough.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.640
What do you want?

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.760
What's that?

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.640
A paternity test.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.080
What is it, Will?

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.920
It's Maggie.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.200
What's happening with Maggie?

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.920
She's my daughter.

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.960
Yes. My daughter is a Leister.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.640
That's a lie. Isn't it, Dad?

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.160
I always had my doubts about Maggie.

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.560
You say this now
that your husband's kicking you out.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.680
I'm not doing this for me.
The swine asked for a paternity test.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.560
And I won't leave my daughter defenseless.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.000
Can it be?

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.760
Maybe. In the Bahamas.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.920
Before the divorce.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.920
I loved that vacation.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.760
Get out of here! Get out of here! Out!

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.120
How did you get my DNA?

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.560
Pink toothbrush.

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.760
White toothbrush.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.880
Did you sneak into the mansion?

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.160
It was me.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:33.720
What?

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.000
I let her in.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.520
How could you?

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.520
What the letter said was real, Nick.
She didn't abandon you.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.360
You brought the letter?

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.920
I thought the truth would help you.

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.760
Help me do what?

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.360
To find out that
my grandfather is a monster?

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.720
That my father
has been fooling me my whole life?

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.320
That my mother still doesn't love me

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.080
and only wants to protect
her daughter's future?

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.680
I believed her!
I thought she wanted to win you back.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.000
You helped her, Noah.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.320
Do you know what you've unleashed?

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.560
You have ruined all our lives!

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.560
Our family's.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.160
Us.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.280
No, not us.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.880
All of this is your fault.

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.520
Wait, please.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.440
You knew what I was going to say
at the gala, about Briar, the races.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.280
I didn't mind.
I just wanted us to be brave.

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.000
This is your chance to be brave.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.760
And if you don't,
it doesn't really matter.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.680
I love you more than my life,
and I could never abandon you.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.760
This is worse than abandoning.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.240
You stabbed me in the back.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.040
Nick!

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.160
Nick.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.320
Nick.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:40:59.720
Nick.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.480
Are you all right, Miss Noah?
Can I help you?

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.880
Everything is over.

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.200
Everything is over.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.920
Nick, you don't know
how much you're screwing shit up.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.120
Maybe.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.280
But it's my shit.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.440
Nick!

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.040
Wait up, brother.

01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.640
I knew you'd end up finding out.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.520
I didn't want to tell you, but...
they've been hooking up for a while.

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.800
You're wrong if you think this hurts me.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.040
You're so dumb, bro!
Why did you kiss Sofía?

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.440
Noah fucked things up with my mother.
She deserves it.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.080
Your mother. Always your mother.
You really have a problem, dude.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.840
- You have to grow up.
- Don't lecture me. What about you?

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.240
Me? I couldn't even stay angry
at Jenna for half an hour.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.800
I preferred to swallow my pride.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:41.000
Good for you.
I hope you live happily ever after.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.880
Remember when I told you
they were kids and they would fly away?

01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:48.400
Well, they did.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.120
And they've shown us that
they are way more mature than us.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320
You know?

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.560
When Jenna said we were over, I felt...

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.640
as if...

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.600
as if a huge wave swallowed me up.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.360
Tell me that's not what you felt
when you ended things with Noah.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.440
Why are you doing all this?

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.000
Don't waste all your tears, my dear.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.800
You'll have plenty of time to miss him.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:55.640
Where's Noah?

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.600
You're too late, Romeo.

01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.520
- What did you tell her?
- What do you think?

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.360
How wonderful you are.

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.600
I'm really sorry about the accident.
I really am.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.120
You didn't even wait for me
to leave the hospital.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.880
You just left me there
with more than 20 fractures.

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.360
And you knew how I was.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.080
What do you mean?

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.320
Pregnant.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.680
I swear I had no idea.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.760
Don't play dumb.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.560
They told me I lost it in the accident.

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.000
But I know it was you.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.640
Your family! The hospital was yours!

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.640
Listen, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense, Briar.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.040
But, if you really lost it,
believe me, I'm truly sorry.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.760
Guilt makes you feel better.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.000
Not me.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.120
I need you to pay.

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.560
Tell me where the fuck Noah is.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.000
She must be on her way to the apartment.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.320
To slit her wrists. I hope.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.840
Damn.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.840
Noah! Noah!

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.120
Noah!

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.960
Here. Dry off a bit.

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.680
Give me the handbag.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.720
I lost my keys.

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.800
Don't worry.

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.560
I couldn't sleep.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.120
Forgive me.
I know you only wanted to help me.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.040
I love you

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.000
SLIDE TO TURN OFF

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.280
Are you okay?

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.600
Did something happen?

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.960
My God, you're freezing.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.240
I can't talk. Just hug me.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.560
No, thank you.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.080
That's still wet.

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.320
Here, put this on.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200
Ciao.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.760
What have we done, Will?

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.760
We ruined everything.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.440
You know that, right?

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.760
Whatever happens to them from now on
will be our fault.

01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.520
YOUR ABSENCE WILL FOLLOW ME WHILE I SLEEP

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.960
Goodbye, Dad.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.120
ALWAYS

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.000
NOAH, I WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.480
NOAH, I WILL ALWAYS BE
YOUR LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS - NICK
