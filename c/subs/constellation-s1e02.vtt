00:19.811 --> 00:22.064
Alice, baby, talk to me.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.775
You gotta stay awake.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.611
Can't fall asleep. Alice!

00:28.278 --> 00:29.655
How did you get there?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.806
Alice? Baby?

00:55.806 --> 00:56.890
My baby.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.520
Are you a ghost?

01:05.774 --> 01:07.818
Mummy's gonna be right back, okay?

01:10.988 --> 01:11.989
Okay.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.962
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.547
Mummy's gonna take care of you.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.591
My love.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.433
You smell like you again.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.312
Who else should I smell like?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.700
This might sting a little bit.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.118
But it's gonna get you warm.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.371
Mamma...

02:02.831 --> 02:03.957
I missed you.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.128
I missed you too.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.222
Oh, no. We're out of hot water.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.182
I'm gonna boil you some more.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.351
Don't go.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.164
Mamma. I'm cold.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.798
Mummy?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.194
Alice?

03:56.111 --> 03:56.945
Alice?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.406
Where are you?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.657
- Where's--
- I'm here.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.640
What's the matter?

04:26.558 --> 04:27.601
Where is she?

04:29.353 --> 04:30.354
Who?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.914
TsUP, this is Station. Do you copy?

04:55.671 --> 04:56.797
Can you hear me?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.886
I've lost time.

05:03.887 --> 05:04.972
I've lost hours.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.560
I think my blood oxygen is low.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.062
I passed out in--

05:21.154 --> 05:25.826
Remaining life support,
six hours 45 minutes.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.073
Major Lysenko.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.451
Commander Caldera.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.540
You make me feel obscurely better.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.375
You always say that,

06:15.918 --> 06:17.753
but I never know if it's true.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.380
I have equipment here
that immediately needs to go

06:20.380 --> 06:22.716
with search and rescue for Soyuz 1.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.719
It is not certain that there will be
a search and rescue for Soyuz 1.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.304
Why?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.098
There is no sign of life.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.060
Let's go.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.214
Okay. Do it.

07:09.847 --> 07:10.931
It's gonna work.

07:13.684 --> 07:14.726
Nice and steady.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.644
Nice and ste--

07:20.190 --> 07:21.024
Yes.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.794
I don't know if you can hear me
in the blind.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.588
This is Station.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.008
That's battery two transferred to Soyuz.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.890
It's taken approximately 55 minutes
to switch one battery.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.601
I have four left.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.312
And then 90 minutes undocking procedure.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.648
Oh, shit.

09:36.869 --> 09:37.870
Hello?

09:39.788 --> 09:40.914
Can anyone hear me?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.001
This is Station.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.924
I'm afraid of the dark.

09:55.721 --> 09:58.015
There are other rockets, right?

09:59.057 --> 10:03.187
I mean, there's all those
insane billionaires. StarCosm. Yes?

10:03.187 --> 10:05.522
Even if StarCosm went crazy, there--

10:05.522 --> 10:07.482
there's no way they'd launch
in under a day.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.903
And she doesn't have a day.
She has a few hours.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.238
There must be a way for her to get back.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.449
I mean, that has to be possible.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.826
They didn't manage to send her
the deorbit parameters in time.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.620
I don't know--
What is a deorbit parameter, Frederic?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.914
Meaning even if she fixes the capsule,

10:22.664 --> 10:25.209
she's going to have to calculate
her own reentry.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.420
This is very dangerous.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.383
But this is what she's trained for.

10:34.885 --> 10:40.098
I mean, you trained her for four years.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.144
Yes?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.442
Oh, for God's sake, don't you cry.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.238
Don't you sit there crying,
for fuck's sake.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.205
- Wendy!
- Coming!

11:03.205 --> 11:04.873
- Bye, Alice.
- See you later.

11:10.712 --> 11:11.839
Alice...

11:13.924 --> 11:14.925
You done?

11:16.635 --> 11:19.471
I just need to talk to the others
before they leave.

11:21.723 --> 11:22.850
Is she dead?

11:24.560 --> 11:25.394
No.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.402
She doesn't have a lot of time though.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.363
She's not dead
until we know that she's dead, is she?

11:38.949 --> 11:39.867
No.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.164
I love you, kiddo.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.960
Hey, baby. Hey, Magnus.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.298
I thought I'd record something
since I can't talk to you guys.

11:56.175 --> 12:00.554
Okay, so I gotta fix all this stuff
so I can get home.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.439
It's nice to hear a voice...

12:11.815 --> 12:13.317
even if it's just my own.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.365
Yes.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.828
This is the third.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.583
Kind of need to hurry up.

12:49.645 --> 12:53.440
<i>...is the third. Kind of need to hurry up.</i>

13:03.825 --> 13:05.285
<i>...is the third.</i>

13:06.620 --> 13:13.335
<i>Kind of need to hurry up.</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:23.136
<i>You gotta stop breathing.</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:25.889
<i>Stop breathing, Jo.</i>

13:26.974 --> 13:28.350
<i>You stay in Destiny.</i>

13:32.855 --> 13:33.856
Paul?

15:40.274 --> 15:42.484
What the hell are StarCosm doing?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.903
<i>We're talking to Alyanna.
They are scrambling,</i>

15:44.903 --> 15:46.947
but, Henry, she'll be dead by then.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.825
That's a third of a billion dollars
to retrieve two dead bodies

15:49.825 --> 15:51.535
<i>and some experimental equipment.</i>

15:52.661 --> 15:55.706
Some experimental equipment, Michaela?

15:55.706 --> 15:58.000
It's a highly significant
piece of research.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.170
<i>Not only for our understanding
of the theoretical universe,</i>

16:01.170 --> 16:05.257
but also for about a thousand
different practical applications

16:05.257 --> 16:08.677
that can make a fundamental
difference to life on this planet.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.471
The science cannot trump
the people, Henry.

16:13.682 --> 16:14.516
Yeah.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.119
Okay.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.955
<i>Station, this is TsUP.</i>

16:39.458 --> 16:40.375
Okay.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.795
Hi. Read loud and clear.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.382
Any chance
for a chat with my family today?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.677
<i>Station, this is TsUP.</i>

16:51.637 --> 16:53.680
<i>This is a recorded message.</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:56.016
<i>We have S-band failure
and cannot hear you.</i>

16:56.934 --> 16:59.353
- <i>Open all bands for local transmission.</i>
- Christ.

16:59.895 --> 17:03.273
<i>We're attempting
to upload your deorbit parameters.</i>

17:03.273 --> 17:06.568
<i>RPL requests
that you retrieve CAL data core.</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:09.363
<i>Restore full power to Soyuz 1.</i>

17:09.905 --> 17:12.866
<i>Initiate undock as soon as possible.</i>

17:12.866 --> 17:17.079
<i>You have approximately two hours
and 30 minutes of life support</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:21.124
<i>as of 9:38 on 10/15.</i>

17:28.464 --> 17:30.008
Come on.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.929
Station, this is TsUP.
This is a recorded message.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.849
- You open on loops one and four?
- Sure we did.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.184
There is nothing near her, not from us.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.979
We don't put satellites
in the vicinity of the ISS.

17:41.979 --> 17:46.149
Between you and me,
the US Air Force has moveable satellites.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.193
I've requested that they put them higher.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.444
We know that, Henry,

17:49.444 --> 17:52.239
but moving them closer
isn't going to help reach her.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.909
If the damage is too significant,
she may not be able to hear anyone.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.621
Commander Caldera, you have a call
from Skagerrak Marine Observatory.

17:59.621 --> 18:00.789
Oh, Christ.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.291
Skagerrak?

18:04.793 --> 18:06.587
Don't look at me like that.

18:06.587 --> 18:09.423
I'm not losing the CAL.
I am not losing her.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.341
That is not what happens.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.052
Station, TsUP. This is a recorded message.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.638
We have S-band failure
and cannot hear you.

18:18.682 --> 18:19.725
You heard from your sister?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.896
I think you know that she has passed away.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.025
Have you heard from your brother?

18:28.859 --> 18:30.360
Not in many years.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.155
Thank God.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.448
<i>...as we wait to find out</i>

18:34.448 --> 18:38.035
<i>what's become of the astronaut still left
on the International Space Station</i>

18:38.035 --> 18:41.413
<i>now literally the loneliest person
in the universe.</i>

18:41.413 --> 18:43.624
<i>With me is retired astronaut Bud Caldera.</i>

18:43.624 --> 18:48.003
<i>Commander, what happens when the structure
of the ISS is damaged in such a way?</i>

18:48.003 --> 18:50.380
That would lead to
what is called a "depress."

18:50.380 --> 18:53.967
Depressurization of the various modules
on the ISS.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.803
That's pretty much
the most serious thing that can happen.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.098
<i>Just talk through
what would be taking place up there</i>

19:00.098 --> 19:01.683
<i>with the astronaut that's left.</i>

19:01.683 --> 19:03.185
Well, it goes by protocol.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.646
We have these flip-books with checklists,

19:05.646 --> 19:08.899
and we prepare pretty much every scenario
during training.

19:08.899 --> 19:13.487
So even if it's an unusual situation,
they'll be working according to a scheme.

19:13.487 --> 19:17.699
<i>But you have experience of what can happen
if something goes wrong up there.</i>

19:17.699 --> 19:19.034
Sure.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.119
<i>It must bring back some memories for you.</i>

19:23.163 --> 19:24.873
No, I'm not looking for--

19:24.873 --> 19:27.668
I don't spend my time
bringing up memories.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.044
<i>But you do have experience</i>

19:29.044 --> 19:31.255
<i>on what it's like
to bring bodies back home.</i>

19:31.255 --> 19:33.549
That's not a question.
That's an observation.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.175
<i>Can you maybe just tell me a little</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:37.594
<i>about what you imagine
they must be feeling right now?</i>

19:37.594 --> 19:39.763
Yeah, and why the hell should I do that?

19:39.763 --> 19:42.641
And you instruct me on what's "a little"?

19:42.641 --> 19:46.061
I don't get paid
to use my goddamn imagination.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.939
<i>Henry Caldera, many thanks.</i>

19:48.939 --> 19:53.735
It's Bud! Bud Caldera, for Christ's sakes!

19:56.613 --> 19:57.614
Fuck.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.721
TsUP, this is Station. Come in.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.310
Okay.

21:08.894 --> 21:12.231
So that is power fully restored
to Soyuz 1.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.151
- <i>Station, this is TsUP.</i>
- This is Station. Come in.

21:16.735 --> 21:18.487
<i>This is a recorded message.</i>

21:18.487 --> 21:19.738
<i>You have approximately</i>

21:19.738 --> 21:24.701
- <i>98 minutes of life support as of 10:48.</i>
- Of course.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.538
<i>Minimum undock time is 90 minutes.</i>

21:27.538 --> 21:28.455
Fuck.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.333
<i>RPL requests you retrieve CAL data core.</i>

21:31.333 --> 21:32.251
You're kidding me.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.962
<i>We're attempting
to upload your deorbit parameters.</i>

21:36.338 --> 21:37.631
I can't wait for you.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.092
Okay.

21:41.677 --> 21:43.929
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.098
Okay.

21:47.683 --> 21:48.725
What the--

21:49.601 --> 21:51.353
"Oxygen, 19%."

21:52.354 --> 21:53.355
I gotta go.

21:56.650 --> 21:57.651
In the blind.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.946
Initiating undocking procedure, Soyuz 1.

22:04.908 --> 22:05.826
Go.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.495
"Input deorbit parameters."

22:08.495 --> 22:11.957
So I'm gonna use yesterday's figures
'cause that's all I got.

22:12.958 --> 22:15.002
"Deorbit parameters outdated."

22:15.919 --> 22:17.796
Yeah, I know, but you gotta work with me.

22:19.756 --> 22:20.757
Oh, come on.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.304
Come on, come on. Please come on.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.640
"Undock initiated."

22:29.933 --> 22:31.560
"Ninety minutes to launch."

22:36.064 --> 22:38.483
Station, this is TsUP.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.277
This is a recorded message.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.030
We have S-band failure
and cannot hear you.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.742
Please open all bands

22:47.534 --> 22:50.078
We are attempting
to upload deorbit parameters.

22:51.622 --> 22:54.541
Daddy, what are deorbit parameters?

22:59.296 --> 23:02.216
Well, as I understand it,

23:02.216 --> 23:04.468
it's the place on the edge of the Earth

23:04.468 --> 23:07.638
that you have to hit
if you wanna come home.

23:08.931 --> 23:10.682
Does Mummy know what they are?

23:12.809 --> 23:13.810
I don't know.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.356
I'm sure she does.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.401
She's very clever.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.046
Fuck...

23:43.632 --> 23:45.843
- <i>Station, it's TsUP.</i>
- Shut up.

23:45.843 --> 23:48.595
<i>We have S-band failure

23:51.849 --> 23:54.810
<i>Please calculate

24:00.732 --> 24:03.402
- <i>Don't endanger yourself.</i>
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.693
Hey, Magnus.

24:45.861 --> 24:49.072
I'm going to put in
the deorbit parameters.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.741
My own calculations.

24:50.741 --> 24:54.411
Let's just hope it takes me back.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.125
Forty-one...

25:10.719 --> 25:13.180
Magnus, I know you.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.683
And you know why I had to do this.

25:17.809 --> 25:21.438
And I am so grateful for your love
and your trust.

25:22.356 --> 25:26.026
I know it hasn't been easy.
You've sacrificed a lot...

25:27.861 --> 25:29.112
I'm sorry I--

25:30.489 --> 25:33.825
I left you alone with all this...

25:37.621 --> 25:38.664
I love you.

25:43.043 --> 25:43.961
Alice...

25:50.759 --> 25:52.094
You're everything to me.

25:53.762 --> 25:54.847
And I wanted to--

25:57.057 --> 25:58.725
I wanted to make you proud.

26:00.435 --> 26:01.436
You.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.189
And I wanted to show you that...

26:11.363 --> 26:12.781
Even if I'm not here...

26:14.992 --> 26:17.870
I'm always with you and Daddy.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.583
I don't think you understand how much I--

26:23.417 --> 26:27.087
I just wanted to be around
and see you grow up

26:27.087 --> 26:29.173
and go to high school

26:30.549 --> 26:33.427
and have your first boyfriend and...

26:35.429 --> 26:37.306
then go out dancing with you

26:38.265 --> 26:42.936
when you get old and just--
just be around to see you grow up.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.820
No matter what happens,

26:53.197 --> 26:56.783
my eyes are always on you.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.288
And--

27:05.876 --> 27:10.923
And my heart beats with you, baby.

27:14.718 --> 27:19.598
I love you so much,
more than you can ever imagine.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.939
Okay. So, I've only got 12 minutes left,

27:27.523 --> 27:28.857
and I kind of gotta--

27:32.528 --> 27:34.446
I just hope I got my sums right.

29:00.908 --> 29:01.909
Okay.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.937
"Bolt malfunction"?

29:30.562 --> 29:34.483
What? What the fuck?

29:36.109 --> 29:37.861
Arm bolts are fine. Can't be the data.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.576
"In the event of bolt system malfunction,

29:45.077 --> 29:48.580
bolts to be armed and fired
from entry dock of ISS

29:49.164 --> 29:50.749
on the other side of the hatch.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.335
Requires two crew."

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
Fuck.

30:04.721 --> 30:05.722
Come on.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.101
Come on, please.

30:09.726 --> 30:12.646
<i>Forty-one, 40, 39,</i>

30:12.646 --> 30:17.025
<i>thirty-eight, 37, 36, 35...</i>

30:17.025 --> 30:19.361
Anything on triangulation?

30:19.361 --> 30:21.280
Nothing. Still nothing.

30:21.280 --> 30:25.742
<i>...thirty, 29, 28, 27, 26,</i>

30:25.742 --> 30:29.663
<i>twenty-five, 24, 23, 22,</i>

30:29.663 --> 30:33.709
<i>twenty-one, 20, 19, 18</i>

30:33.709 --> 30:36.920
<i>seventeen, 16, 15,</i>

30:36.920 --> 30:41.133
<i>fourteen, 13, 12, 11,</i>

30:41.133 --> 30:45.220
<i>ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

30:45.220 --> 30:50.809
<i>six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

31:18.212 --> 31:19.254
Listen.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.679
Close your eyes.

31:30.307 --> 31:35.604
When the names of those who have
fallen asleep are remembered in prayers,

31:35.604 --> 31:41.068
what can be more beneficial for them
than this?

31:41.652 --> 31:48.408
We who live believe that the dead
are not deprived of existence,

31:48.909 --> 31:51.036
but live with God.

31:53.121 --> 31:58.252
As we pray for our brothers and sisters

31:58.252 --> 32:01.839
who with faith and hope are traveling

32:02.422 --> 32:08.637
so we pray for those who have departed
from this world.

32:33.579 --> 32:34.997
Jo, this is TsUP.

32:36.540 --> 32:37.666
Do you copy?

32:59.271 --> 33:00.272
Okay.

33:31.428 --> 33:32.763
Detached from ISS.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.856
Three hours and 20 minutes to reentry...

33:45.234 --> 33:46.318
I think.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.957
Thought you might not want to be alone.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.167
I'm quite happy to be alone.

34:03.544 --> 34:08.507
So, how much you guys charging
for a return trip on Soyuz these days?

34:08.507 --> 34:10.634
75 million, up and back?

34:10.634 --> 34:12.261
That is coming to an end.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.847
Unless you start sending tourists.

34:14.847 --> 34:17.558
Tourists? Oh, please.

34:18.851 --> 34:19.851
Cheers.

34:21.353 --> 34:22.353
Jo and Paul.

34:26.275 --> 34:27.442
Jo and Paul.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.741
Okay.

34:39.329 --> 34:40.330
Okay.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.467
Fire in...

34:53.177 --> 34:57.472
five, four, three,

34:57.472 --> 34:59.349
two, one.

35:06.481 --> 35:10.402
The ISS was not designed
to run more than 20 years.

35:10.402 --> 35:12.696
It's been running nearly 30.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.072
And it's full of holes.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.450
Your own president says
another seven years max.

35:16.450 --> 35:19.995
My own president is wrong.
I'm working on my own president.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.623
We are going to withdraw from the program.

35:23.582 --> 35:25.375
Just abandon things

35:26.126 --> 35:28.754
because something went wrong,
because someone dies?

35:29.379 --> 35:32.424
NASA abandoned the moon after Apollo 18.

35:32.424 --> 35:34.426
So that's what this is all about, huh?

35:35.010 --> 35:37.304
You know what I've been doing
all these years.

35:39.306 --> 35:41.600
Perhaps for me, it is about that.

35:42.351 --> 35:46.146
For Roscosmos, it's about taking advantage
of a natural stop.

35:47.689 --> 35:52.569
You are not the least bit curious about
the illness of which you are an expert?

35:55.030 --> 35:59.785
There was a fatal accident
after years of warning about debris.

35:59.785 --> 36:02.329
This will happen again, Henry.

36:04.206 --> 36:07.835
And there are a whole lot of answers
we are never going to get.

36:08.377 --> 36:12.214
Agreed. We will designate the ISS
as an international grave,

36:12.214 --> 36:14.675
and leave space to the people with money.

36:21.223 --> 36:23.892
Soyuz 1, this is TsUP. Can you hear me?

36:25.811 --> 36:30.357
TsUP, this is Soyuz 1 reentry.
Are you receiving?

36:31.066 --> 36:34.111
This is Soyuz 1. Come in, please.

36:39.825 --> 36:42.870
Soyuz 1 has reentered Earth atmosphere.
She is not responding.

36:42.870 --> 36:43.996
It's in ballistic entry.

36:43.996 --> 36:46.331
- Where's she gonna hit?
- Anywhere within 300 kilometers.

36:46.331 --> 36:49.376
Get your ham radio guys and get her.
We need to know where the hell she is.

36:49.376 --> 36:52.045
- This is a needle in a haystack.
- Can't you call NORAD?

36:52.045 --> 36:54.047
Call your fucking guy in Egypt.

36:54.047 --> 36:57.301
Roscosmos Control, this is Soyuz 1.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.428
Do you read me?

36:59.428 --> 37:02.097
Roscosmos Control, this is Soyuz 1.

37:02.097 --> 37:03.182
Do you read me?

37:16.945 --> 37:17.946
Soyuz 1...

37:19.907 --> 37:23.076
Soyuz 1, this is TsUP. Do you copy?

37:26.496 --> 37:28.290
<i>Soyuz 1, this is TsUP.</i>

37:28.290 --> 37:29.249
- <i>We can't...</i>
- Oh, shit.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.211
- <i>Open all VHF bands.</i>
- I need to--

37:36.548 --> 37:41.053
Soyuz 1, this is TsUP. Repeat.
Open all VHF bands.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.055
There's a-- I'm trying! I'm trying!

37:53.857 --> 37:54.900
TsUP!

37:59.446 --> 38:01.281
Soyuz 1, we hear you.

38:01.281 --> 38:05.035
You've hit 6.5 degrees off optimal,
you need to correct.

38:05.619 --> 38:08.038
I'm on ballistic approach, I can't.

38:08.956 --> 38:11.291
Ask her if she retrieved the data core.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.627
- Oh, Henry, for Christ's sake.
- Ask her.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.712
Do you have the CAL phase four data core?

38:16.922 --> 38:17.840
Yes.

38:18.423 --> 38:19.967
Jo? Jo?

38:22.344 --> 38:23.679
Do you have her? Where is she?

38:23.679 --> 38:26.223
You're going
in ballistic at a very steep angle.

38:26.223 --> 38:27.933
You've got 8G coming up.

38:27.933 --> 38:29.184
<i>Understood.</i>

38:29.685 --> 38:31.186
Jo! Jo?

38:31.687 --> 38:33.939
Hi. Hi.

38:33.939 --> 38:36.191
Jo, you're going into the black.

38:37.359 --> 38:39.111
It's gonna take us some time to find you.

38:39.820 --> 38:40.821
Good luck.

38:58.922 --> 39:01.675
Hi. Guess what?

39:02.384 --> 39:03.719
What?

39:17.149 --> 39:19.318
It's marked with RPL flashes.

39:19.318 --> 39:22.237
It goes on
Search and Rescue helicopter number 1.

39:22.237 --> 39:24.740
- Now, goddamn it, let's move it.
- Will do.

39:37.002 --> 39:40.797
She's got a super short time.
It's gonna be very tough to locate her.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.466
Don't bloody do this to me, Frederic.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.384
I've just told my daughter
it's gonna be all right!

40:29.429 --> 40:32.391
Heading north east,
can't see anything from the helicopters.

40:47.072 --> 40:50.701
<i>Helicopter 5,
check south east above the mountain.</i>

40:50.701 --> 40:53.704
<i>Helicopter 2, north west 22 degrees.</i>

41:10.929 --> 41:11.972
<i>What can you see?</i>

41:13.390 --> 41:16.268
<i>Still nothing, Team 1.</i>

46:26.328 --> 46:27.329
Mummy!

46:30.541 --> 46:32.084
That's my baby.

46:32.084 --> 46:34.503
Put me down. Put me down. That's my baby.

46:36.255 --> 46:37.089
Mummy!

46:57.359 --> 46:58.360
I love you.

47:03.323 --> 47:04.700
I love you so much.

47:12.791 --> 47:14.126
Hi, Jo.

47:16.837 --> 47:17.880
You all right? You okay?

47:20.674 --> 47:24.845
I'm so h-- I'm so happy to be--
I'm so happy to be here.

47:29.057 --> 47:30.434
I love you guys so much.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.604
I love you guys so much.

47:39.276 --> 47:42.487
I-- Welcome back.

47:44.489 --> 47:45.574
Thank you.

47:57.878 --> 47:59.546
Give it to me, please.

48:03.509 --> 48:04.676
Open the case.

48:04.676 --> 48:07.095
The canisters should be prepped.

48:07.095 --> 48:09.223
This is my baby.

48:09.765 --> 48:10.807
Give me the iPad.

48:12.893 --> 48:14.436
Give me some space.

48:23.445 --> 48:24.613
Is that Wendy's dad?

48:24.613 --> 48:27.908
You don't have to look, my love.
Don't look.

48:31.286 --> 48:35.290
So, how are things?

48:36.667 --> 48:37.793
I don't know.

48:38.377 --> 48:40.087
Wow. You look great.

48:43.340 --> 48:46.635
I'm back. I made it back, right?

48:47.886 --> 48:48.887
Yeah.

48:58.397 --> 48:59.398
Hey.

49:00.482 --> 49:04.278
- Hi. Jo, I--
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

49:04.278 --> 49:05.487
Go, guys! Go!

49:06.864 --> 49:08.282
I'll be right back, baby.

49:09.032 --> 49:10.826
- I'm back now.
- She's home.

49:13.078 --> 49:14.955
We'll take you directly to Star City.

49:15.581 --> 49:16.582
Excuse me.

49:23.255 --> 49:24.756
Put that fucking camera away.

49:28.677 --> 49:30.929
Holy shit. It's there.

49:31.889 --> 49:33.307
Goddamn it.

49:36.059 --> 49:37.269
It can't be there.

49:41.148 --> 49:43.108
What is Russian for "eureka"?

50:33.700 --> 50:34.701
Mummy?

50:44.753 --> 50:46.004
Mummy?

50:58.225 --> 50:59.268
Alice?

51:14.825 --> 51:16.243
Are you okay?

51:20.581 --> 51:21.582
Okay.

51:29.464 --> 51:30.465
What?

51:33.051 --> 51:35.053
You forget how Earth smells.

51:53.030 --> 51:54.198
<i>Where is she?</i>

51:54.781 --> 51:55.824
Who?

51:55.824 --> 51:59.411
Where's my baby? Alice!

52:02.664 --> 52:04.333
- What?
- Where is she?

52:04.333 --> 52:07.085
- Who?
- You.

52:07.085 --> 52:08.837
I don't know what you mean.

52:10.589 --> 52:12.007
Didn't you see yourself?

52:13.258 --> 52:15.886
- In the mirror?
- No! Here.

52:15.886 --> 52:17.888
Mummy, I didn't see anything.

52:21.308 --> 52:22.601
Get dressed.

52:27.272 --> 52:28.357
Mummy!

52:30.943 --> 52:31.944
Get ready.

52:45.624 --> 52:47.000
Come on, we gotta go!

52:49.002 --> 52:53.131
It's too cold. She'll freeze to death.
We gotta find her.

52:53.131 --> 52:54.383
Who?

52:55.676 --> 52:56.677
The other you.
