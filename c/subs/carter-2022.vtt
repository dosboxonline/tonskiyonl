00:38.163 --> 00:39.748
[reporter] A mutant virus has emerged

00:39.831 --> 00:42.959
in which patients begin
to exhibit symptoms within five minutes

00:43.043 --> 00:44.544
in low-pressured environments.

00:44.627 --> 00:49.174
A much faster pace compared
to previous incubation period of 24 hours.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.635
Raising even greater concerns
in regards to containment.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.887
After the outbreak,

00:53.970 --> 00:56.931
the increase of symptoms
like abnormal physical ability

00:57.015 --> 00:58.266
and violent tendencies

00:58.349 --> 01:01.603
has led the infected
to display animal-like behaviors,

01:01.686 --> 01:04.898
making it difficult
to secure quarantine facilities.

01:04.981 --> 01:09.652
In the United States, more than
150,000 people have been infected,

01:09.736 --> 01:13.114
mostly by US forces
returning home from serving in Korea,

01:13.198 --> 01:15.867
and more than 30,000 have died.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.869
North Korea is on the verge of collapse

01:17.952 --> 01:20.705
with over eight and a half million
reported infected people,

01:20.789 --> 01:23.583
representing a third
of the country's total population.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.377
By contrast,
South Korea has just been declared

01:26.461 --> 01:29.756
a DMZ Virus-free zone
by the World Health Organization today

01:29.839 --> 01:32.801
when the last known infected person
known only as "Choi"

01:32.884 --> 01:34.761
died after a thirteen-day illness.

01:34.844 --> 01:39.557

The cause of the DMZ Virus

03:03.057 --> 03:05.852
which was allegedly
first detected in the DMZ,

03:05.935 --> 03:09.981
a symbol of the ceasefire between
North and South Korea, ten months ago,

03:10.064 --> 03:11.941
has not yet been identified.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.361
It has been 19 days since Dr. Jung
and his daughter have disappeared

03:15.445 --> 03:16.946
while on their way to North Korea,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.866
and there is no information
about their whereabouts.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.743
Dr. Jung became quite famous,

03:21.826 --> 03:25.455
after curing his daughter Ha-na
of the DMZ virus,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.082
drawing the attention
of academics worldwide.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.420
Dr. Jung had been en route
to the Sinuiju Chemical Weapons Institute

03:32.503 --> 03:35.131
in order to mass produce
the antibody treatment,

03:35.215 --> 03:38.551
as was agreed upon
by both North and South Korea,

03:38.635 --> 03:41.137
when he disappeared
along with his daughter.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.722
Some organizations accused

03:42.805 --> 03:44.933
the South Korean government
of putting on a show

03:45.016 --> 03:47.769
in order to cripple
the North Korean infrastructure,

03:47.852 --> 03:51.981
and warned that demonstrations
demanding the whereabouts of Dr. Jung

03:52.065 --> 03:55.443
and his daughter,
as well as their return to North Korea,

03:55.526 --> 03:57.654

labeling them as pro-North Korean,

04:03.534 --> 04:06.746
accusing them of working
for the North Korean government,

04:06.829 --> 04:09.207
and warned of a counter demonstration.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.417
As a result, police are on high alert

Please, please, come on, hurry.

-Come on, hurry. Please.
-What do I say?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.730
[women gasping]

18:27.272 --> 18:28.857
Yes, I'm at a clothing store.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.527
A strange man…

18:34.404 --> 18:35.489
[gasps]

18:40.244 --> 18:41.870
[woman on earpiece]
You'll find a staircase

18:41.954 --> 18:44.164
at the end of the left passage.
Go upstairs.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.583
[Carter] How do you know all this?

18:46.667 --> 18:48.544
[woman] I can get
the security camera information

18:48.627 --> 18:50.129
and the blind spots from your earpiece,

18:50.212 --> 18:52.756
which can detect heat signatures
in your fifty-meter radius.

A target with a CIA frequency
is approaching.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.481
[coughing]

19:09.565 --> 19:12.359
[woman] Eliminate him
and secure his device.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.897
[woman] The CIA is all over the place.
Hide somewhere, now.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.107
[grunting]

19:55.736 --> 19:57.446
[woman] Secure the device on his wrist.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.489
We're going to backtrace their hideout.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.202
"Backtrace"?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.537
[woman] There's a car approaching
at the end of the alley.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.623
Get in the car and hand over the device.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.875
Tell me why the CIA is chasing me.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.127
[woman] There's a lethal bomb
planted in your mouth.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.630
It has blast radius of ten meters.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.886
If you refuse to work with us,
it will activate.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.639
License plate 4566.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.099
Your questions will be answered
once you get into the car.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.185
And why would I get in that car?

20:28.268 --> 20:29.228
Tell me, now.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.396
[woman] Then you give us no choice.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.315
You must be terminated.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.819
I have the detonator here in my hand.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.074
[Carter panting]

20:43.492 --> 20:46.495
[woman] The car is approaching.
Move it. And hurry.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.580
[tense music playing]

20:57.130 --> 20:58.757
[woman] Is Hye-won doing well in class?

20:58.840 --> 21:01.134

21:25.659 --> 21:28.245

-Right. I'll start tracing them.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.833
Choi Yu-jin, NIS.
Strategic relations with North Korea.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.629
And the woman talking in my ear,
she on your side?

21:37.713 --> 21:38.880
I'm Han Jung Hee.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.757
I work for
the International Liaison Department

21:40.841 --> 21:42.259
of the Labor Party in North Korea.

21:42.342 --> 21:46.471
We are currently working with South Korea
to create a treatment for the DMZ Virus.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.270
[Yu-jin] These are North Koreans
who have been infected by the DMZ Virus.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.356
The infected
are overwhelmingly strong and violent.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.985
Some have been discovered
to even be able to use tools or weapons.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.947
All of South Korea's army is at the DMZ,
holding off the infected,

22:04.031 --> 22:05.991
but every day is precarious.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.660
[Jung Hee] In North Korea, we have secured

22:08.744 --> 22:11.747
a hundred million anthrax vaccines
needed to produce the treatment,

22:11.830 --> 22:13.790
as well as a large scale assembly line,

22:13.874 --> 22:16.960
so that Dr. Jung's research
can be carried out smoothly.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.879
That's the reason we tried to bring

22:18.962 --> 22:20.589
Dr. Jung and his daughter, Jung Ha-na,

22:20.672 --> 22:23.008
to the North
for the completion of the project.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.510
Daughter?

22:25.594 --> 22:27.346
Dr. Jung's daughter was infected

22:27.429 --> 22:29.931
by a field rat
while they were living out in Paju.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.184
He was able to cure his own daughter,

22:32.267 --> 22:35.187
and started studying her antibodies
to find a treatment.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.901
However, due to an abnormal increase
in thromboplastin,

22:40.984 --> 22:43.612
an enzyme that coagulates blood
once it leaves the body,

22:43.695 --> 22:45.655
her antibodies were destroyed in seconds.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.533
That's why we were heading to
the Sinuiju Chemical Weapons Institute,

22:48.617 --> 22:49.785
for Ha-na's blood.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.371
[Jung Hee] However, Ha-na was kidnapped
on her way to North Korea

22:52.454 --> 22:55.624
by an agent from A9,
a secret organization in the CIA,.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.668
Your mission is to find Ha-na
and bring her to North Korea.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.879
You're the one who suggested this mission.

23:00.962 --> 23:01.963
It was your idea.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.424
Why would I?

23:04.508 --> 23:07.803
[Jung Hee] You commanded us
to block the memory center in your brain.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.221
Am I your commander?

23:09.304 --> 23:11.264
[Jung Hee] I suppose you'll return
to your position

23:11.348 --> 23:12.766
after the mission is finished.

23:13.308 --> 23:17.813
Why would I erase my memory,
and give up my rank?

23:17.896 --> 23:20.440
[Jung Hee] You used to be
a CIA agent from South Korea,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.568
but you disguised yourself as a reporter
and entered North Korea.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.489
You became a hero to our people.
You were a hero to South Korea.

23:28.073 --> 23:32.119
However, the North Korean government was
suspicious that you were an American spy

23:32.202 --> 23:34.871
and assigned a woman
to keep a close eye on you.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.625
The two of you fell in love,
and even got married.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.836
And then, you had a daughter.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.505
This woman and I?

23:43.588 --> 23:46.299
[Yu-jin] But your wife died
from the DMZ Virus,

23:46.383 --> 23:48.635
and your daughter, Yoon Hee,
also got infected

23:48.718 --> 23:51.847
and is now imprisoned
in the research facility in Sinuiju.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.974
[beeps]

23:56.309 --> 23:57.853
[Carter on video] This is a good shot.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.688
Look over here.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.440
Yoon Hee.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.525
[somber music playing]

24:10.657 --> 24:11.491
Yoon Hee!

24:13.910 --> 24:15.662
[Yoon Hee] Dad? Dad?

24:16.163 --> 24:18.165
Dad… [sobbing]

24:18.665 --> 24:20.667
-[sobbing] …Dad.
-[Carter] Yoon Hee.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.462
[Yoon Hee sobbing]

24:25.213 --> 24:27.048
[Jung Hee] That scar
on the back of your hand

24:27.132 --> 24:29.301
is from the burn that you got that night.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.972
The weapons you need
for the infiltration are in here.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.101
Now you can do what Han Jung Hee says
until the assignment is complete.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.853
[Jung Hee] You need to save Ha-na

24:40.353 --> 24:42.022
so that your daughter,

24:42.105 --> 24:43.523
Lee Yun Hui, might live.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.609
-[engine revving]

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
[contemplative music playing]

24:52.240 --> 24:53.700
[Jung Hee] Go to the rooftop.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.078
Ha-na is being held in the building
across from this one.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.164
[music continues]

25:00.582 --> 25:02.584
[tires screeching]

25:05.504 --> 25:07.797
Check the weapons in the bag
and put them on.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.511
[unzipping]

25:18.975 --> 25:22.187
We must move Ha-na today
if we want to save your daughter's life.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
She doesn't have much time left.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.611
The majority of those infected
die just under 13 days.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.990
Today is the 13th day
since your daughter was infected.

25:39.829 --> 25:43.124
How do I know
that child is really my daughter?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.876
[Jung Hee] When you get your memory back,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.670
and your daughter is dead,

25:48.004 --> 25:49.339
who will you blame?

25:52.092 --> 25:54.094
[action music playing]

25:57.472 --> 26:00.225
[panting]

26:11.570 --> 26:14.739
Go through the door to your right
and move to the edge of the rooftop.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.706
I've hacked the communication channels
of the CIA agents in the building.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.499
I'm getting their whereabouts now.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.835
[agent 1 on radio] Negative, sir.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.546
We're still working on
establishing the identity of the subject.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.174
[agent 2] Bullshit! Get the geeks
at Langley on it if you have to.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.092
I can't do shit

26:34.175 --> 26:36.886
until we have actual evidence
that the North is on the move.

26:37.554 --> 26:41.016
[Jung Hee] The agents are gathered in
the motel you were in. Now is the chance.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.101

[Jung Hee] The elevator control room is
through the door in front of you.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.807
Move toward it.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.893
[action music continues]

27:35.862 --> 27:37.781
I'm detecting the heat signature
of one adult

27:37.864 --> 27:41.368
near the elevator on the ninth floor
and two on the seventh floor.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.036
This mall looks out of business.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.997
[Jung Hee] It's the perfect place
for the CIA to set up a temporary base.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.209
The agents that were sent to the motel
are on their way back. Hurry.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.585
And Ha-na?

27:50.669 --> 27:52.587
[Jung Hee] I'm detecting
the heat signature.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.048
I'm detecting her on the sixth floor.

once you go through the emergency exit.

What should I do?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.423
[Jung Hee] Hand her the phone.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.508
[Carter panting]

29:30.602 --> 29:32.020
Here, answer it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

[light flickering]

32:14.599 --> 32:16.601
[Carter panting]

32:19.354 --> 32:21.356
[breathing deeply]

32:21.439 --> 32:23.441
[tense music playing]

32:32.700 --> 32:36.412
You are a hard man to find, Mr. Lee.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.333
Carter Lee.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.503
That is your name, isn't it?

32:46.923 --> 32:49.509
Oh, we're playing that game now.

32:50.677 --> 32:51.636
That's fine.

32:52.470 --> 32:56.182
Fortunately for us, I have a shit-ton
of computer geeks back at Langley

32:56.265 --> 32:59.769
who get a boner whenever I ask
them to dig up some shit on people.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.312
[chuckles]

33:01.396 --> 33:02.605
Between you and me,

33:02.689 --> 33:06.109
they're probably a bunch
of introverted perverts who

33:06.651 --> 33:09.320
couldn't do four push-ups
to save their life. But, uh,

33:09.904 --> 33:12.156
they get the job done. So, you know,

33:13.032 --> 33:14.283
what are you gonna to do?

33:18.413 --> 33:19.956
All right, let's see here.

33:20.623 --> 33:26.045
"Carter Lee. Born in 1986.
Jamsil, South Korea."

33:26.838 --> 33:29.590
"Immigrated to New York at age 11."

33:30.258 --> 33:32.468
Blah, blah, blah.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.804
Some more boring shit.

33:36.764 --> 33:37.682
Oh, damn!

33:39.267 --> 33:40.476
You went to Sornell?

33:41.519 --> 33:42.770
My cousin went there!

33:43.479 --> 33:45.064
Yeah! [chuckles]

33:45.148 --> 33:46.691
He was a real piece of shit.

33:46.774 --> 33:47.859
[chuckles softly]

33:48.735 --> 33:50.153
Oh, okay, here we go.

33:50.695 --> 33:55.283
2014, you traveled to North Korea
as a journalist and, uh…

33:56.284 --> 33:57.160
What?

33:58.494 --> 34:01.164
You become
a naturalized citizen of the DPRK?

34:02.623 --> 34:04.208
[gasps] Oh!

34:04.709 --> 34:06.794
I bet it was
all of that socialist bullshit

34:06.878 --> 34:08.796
they taught you back at Sornell.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.548
Am I right? Huh?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.843
A real hero of the people.

34:13.926 --> 34:14.761
Yeah.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.473
[inhales deeply] So,
here's the thing I don't understand,

34:18.556 --> 34:21.184
and, uh, maybe you can help me out this.

34:22.727 --> 34:26.647
What the fuck
are you doing back in South Korea?

34:27.690 --> 34:28.941
And more importantly,

34:29.776 --> 34:33.571
why are you fucking up my shit?

34:33.654 --> 34:35.656
[light flickering]

34:38.576 --> 34:40.411
All right. [chuckles, inhales]

34:41.120 --> 34:43.039
So check this out, man. I…

34:43.790 --> 34:47.168
I actually don't give a fuck about you.
I-- I really don't.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.838
Just tell me who you're working for.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.342
And, uh… we'll call it a day.

34:54.967 --> 34:55.885
Huh?

34:57.303 --> 34:58.262
Is it the North?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.432
Is it the South?

35:03.643 --> 35:06.395
Come on. You can tell Smith Hyeong.

35:08.648 --> 35:12.193
The North or the South.
What does it matter?

35:13.444 --> 35:14.987
[Smith] Oh, shit.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.532
[laughing] You can talk!

35:17.615 --> 35:20.159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, continue.

35:21.410 --> 35:24.622
At least they aren't the ones
watching people die from the virus.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.707
And treating it as an opportunity.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.294
[Smith] So you're saying
the United States…

35:31.879 --> 35:35.174
You think those 300,000
pissed off Koreans out there,

35:35.258 --> 35:36.634
feel the same way?

35:37.426 --> 35:39.470
I don't know,
I think they're pretty convinced

35:39.554 --> 35:43.599
that this is all a fabricated scheme
formed by the South Korean government!

35:43.683 --> 35:44.725
"Fabricated"?

35:45.476 --> 35:47.895
Didn't you create that rumor
to incite a riot?

35:48.771 --> 35:49.605
"Rumor"?

35:50.439 --> 35:52.233
[scoffs] Us?

35:53.276 --> 35:55.278
[laughs]

35:56.154 --> 35:58.739
[inhales deeply] Oh, wow.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.117
Carter.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.829
The things they led you to believe…

36:06.539 --> 36:08.791
Have you ever considered the possibility

36:10.084 --> 36:11.043
that it could be

36:12.753 --> 36:14.130
even more blinding

36:14.964 --> 36:15.882
of the truth?

36:16.841 --> 36:17.842
The real truth?

36:19.510 --> 36:20.428
[agent] Sir!

36:22.346 --> 36:23.431
What is it?

36:23.514 --> 36:25.558
The CCTV results came in.

36:25.641 --> 36:29.270
The movement of Carter Lee matches
that of former CIA Agent Michael Bane

36:29.353 --> 36:30.813
by 87%.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.274
Michael Bane…

36:35.359 --> 36:38.237
Wasn't he KIA in Syria
in your last deployment together?

36:39.071 --> 36:39.989
Yes, sir.

36:40.656 --> 36:41.908
They told us he was dead,

36:41.991 --> 36:44.452
but none of us had
actual eyes on his remains.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.874
[suspenseful music playing]

37:00.801 --> 37:02.929
[groans] The fuck are you doing?

37:04.680 --> 37:05.890
BD-7…

37:07.266 --> 37:09.560
That's how
they successfully wiped his memory.

37:11.479 --> 37:12.313
Maybe.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.193
But I don't think they fully reconstructed
the new one quite yet.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.446
The eyes…

37:21.739 --> 37:23.241
You can change the face,

37:24.283 --> 37:25.451
but not the eyes.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.496
And they never lie.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.794
Is this why you rushed back to Korea?

37:38.089 --> 37:41.050
We'll have the answers
once we've run the DNA lab, sir.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.095
[inhales deeply]

37:44.178 --> 37:46.305
The commies are getting cute. [sighs]

37:47.682 --> 37:48.516
Run it.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.184
Sir.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.605
What the hell's going on?

37:55.773 --> 37:56.857
Hang tight, hero.

37:57.775 --> 37:58.609
Who knows?

37:59.485 --> 38:03.698
Maybe the results will tell me
that you're not as useless as I thought.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.034
[agent 2 on radio] Sir! There's a signal
coming from the subject's body.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.120
Scan it.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.997
[Jung Hee] Carter!
I need to cut communication

38:11.080 --> 38:12.373
from your ear piece for a moment

38:12.456 --> 38:14.250
and use the signal in your molar
as a decoy.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.335
[device whirring]

38:18.045 --> 38:20.673
Picking up a strange signal
coming from his molar, sir.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.884
What the fuck are you waiting on?
Take it out!

38:25.386 --> 38:27.638
[grunts] Get off me! Get off!

38:27.722 --> 38:28.556
[grunts]

38:29.640 --> 38:31.350
[Jung Hee] Just open your mouth.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.351
[grunting]

38:34.979 --> 38:36.147
[groans]

38:36.230 --> 38:38.065

39:11.849 --> 39:13.851

39:16.854 --> 39:18.105
Hold tightly onto me.

Are you okay?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.759
Yes, I'm okay.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.387
Hey, are you all right?

40:33.097 --> 40:35.182

[tires screeching]

41:57.848 --> 42:01.977
[man] Repatriate Dr. Jung to North Korea!

42:02.561 --> 42:04.563
[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

42:05.814 --> 42:09.610

[man] Repatriate Dr. Jung to North Korea!

42:27.920 --> 42:30.047
[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

42:30.130 --> 42:32.383
Ha-na, what's wrong?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.469
[demonstrators] We know! We know!

42:35.553 --> 42:37.179
[Carter] Ha-na! Ha-na!

42:37.263 --> 42:38.180
[Ha-na] Dad.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.558
Dad!

42:40.641 --> 42:43.352
[demonstrators] To North Korea!
To North Korea!

42:57.449 --> 42:58.367
[Dr. Jung] Ha-na.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.869
Do you know how worried I've been?

43:00.953 --> 43:02.246
[panting]

43:02.329 --> 43:03.914
[Dr. Jung] Where have you been?

43:20.806 --> 43:23.017
-Huh?
-[Carter] Ha-na. What's wrong?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.644
[demonstrators] We know! We know!

43:25.728 --> 43:27.062
My dad is over there…

43:28.022 --> 43:30.357
But that's not me.
He's with some other girl…

43:30.441 --> 43:32.443
[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

43:32.526 --> 43:35.696
[woman] We know the US is behind all this!

43:35.779 --> 43:37.573
[demonstrators] We know! We know!

43:37.656 --> 43:40.701
But why are people wearing masks
of me and my dad?

43:42.202 --> 43:44.413
[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

43:45.080 --> 43:47.333
Well, it's because
they want you to stay safe.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.960
[demonstrators] We know! We know!

43:52.171 --> 43:53.631
[Carter] Should we put them on too?

43:54.673 --> 43:57.217
[demonstrators] Repatriate! Repatriate!

43:57.301 --> 44:00.596
[woman] We know the US is behind all this!

44:00.679 --> 44:02.848
We know! We know!

44:02.931 --> 44:04.933
[thunder rumbling]

44:09.980 --> 44:11.815
[newscaster] We bring you breaking news.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.318
Dr. Jung, who had been missing until now,

44:14.401 --> 44:16.904
has been confirmed to be in Sinuiju.

44:16.987 --> 44:20.491
We've just received a video
showing Dr. Jung himself.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.701
Let us take a look.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.789
[Dr. Jung] Hello. I am Jung Byeong-ho.

44:26.872 --> 44:30.125
And I have arrived safely to Sinuiju,

44:30.709 --> 44:33.379
thanks to the North
and South Korean governments.

44:33.879 --> 44:37.007
I have also spoken to my daughter
on the phone moments ago

44:37.591 --> 44:40.803
and I plan to start developing a cure
as soon as possible…

44:40.886 --> 44:42.471
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH JUNG BYEONG-HO

44:42.554 --> 44:45.182
once I make it to
the Sinuiju Institute as planned.

44:45.265 --> 44:49.687
Also, I have heard rumors
that the South Korean government

44:50.479 --> 44:52.690
is attempting to destroy the North
right now.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.402
However, I assure you it is not true.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.029
Please do not be misled.

44:59.780 --> 45:03.200
[newscaster] That was a video of Dr. Jung
sent directly from Sinuiju.

45:03.283 --> 45:07.413
We will be reporting the rest
on our regular scheduled news. Thank you.

45:19.341 --> 45:21.343
[thunder rumbling]

45:24.430 --> 45:26.932
[thunder crashing]

45:46.785 --> 45:48.412
This should be good enough.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.498
One year anniversary song.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.792
Three, two, one.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.335
-No! He can't.
-What?

45:55.419 --> 45:57.880
-You're terrible at writing songs.
-Yeah, I can't. [laughs]

45:57.963 --> 45:58.797
Wait, try again…

45:58.881 --> 46:01.300
[Jung Hee] Carter, why did you stop?

46:02.926 --> 46:04.386
Ha-na is a little tired.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.721
-I'm fine--
-Shh.

46:05.804 --> 46:09.183
[Jung Hee] The van is approaching
across the street. Hurry.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.268
[suspenseful music playing]

46:32.623 --> 46:34.625

DAEHAN TAEKWONDO

47:07.825 --> 47:08.700
[Yu-jin] What?

47:09.576 --> 47:11.912
Carter is heading towards the bus
with Ha-na!

47:11.995 --> 47:14.581
[Jung Hee] Carter. Where are you going?

47:15.123 --> 47:16.708
Follow my instructions.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.419
I'm detecting the movements
of CIA agents nearby.

47:20.045 --> 47:22.506
Carter! Why are you getting on a bus
all of a sudden?

47:22.589 --> 47:25.843
Get off the bus!
Listen to my instructions. Carter!

47:26.343 --> 47:28.846
I think the CIA has caught on to your van.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.807
[Jung Hee] If you don't follow my orders,
you and your daughter will both-

47:31.890 --> 47:34.977
-[electronic warble and whine]
-[groans]

47:35.769 --> 47:36.603
[grunts]

47:36.687 --> 47:38.689
[panting]

47:40.774 --> 47:43.277
I've blocked the signal
to the device in your ear, Mich…

47:43.360 --> 47:44.403
Agent Bane.

47:44.486 --> 47:46.613
Why are you calling me Michael Bane?

47:46.697 --> 47:49.157
It's time you tell me who you really are.

47:49.241 --> 47:52.119
Someone who knows you better
than that voice in your ear.

47:52.619 --> 47:55.038
Yeah? What makes you so sure?

47:56.248 --> 47:57.207
[exhales sharply]

47:57.291 --> 48:02.963
There was a time
where we faced life and death, together.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.467
I'm on your side, Mike. I always was.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.678
My side?

48:10.554 --> 48:12.723
Your men just tried to kill me back there.

48:13.849 --> 48:16.894
And you expect me
to believe that you're on my side?

48:19.146 --> 48:20.856
You really don't remember us?

48:22.900 --> 48:24.109
[scoffs]

48:24.192 --> 48:25.485
I still see you…

48:27.696 --> 48:29.239
In your eyes, I…

48:30.115 --> 48:32.200
I just know you're still there.

48:34.661 --> 48:36.246
I just know it's you.

48:37.372 --> 48:38.707
[breathes deeply]

48:40.334 --> 48:41.418
[scoffs] Never mind.

48:41.501 --> 48:42.753
[sniffles]

48:42.836 --> 48:45.130
It doesn't matter
if you remember me or not.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.424
The DNA test will prove
that you're Michael Bane.

48:47.507 --> 48:51.094
And until then,
our agency will continue to hunt you down.

48:51.595 --> 48:54.306
You have to trust me
if you want to survive.

48:55.599 --> 48:56.433
Yeah?

48:57.309 --> 48:59.353
I've been hearing that a lot lately.

49:00.479 --> 49:03.607
Fine. It's time you know
who they really are.

49:04.399 --> 49:07.235
[man on earpiece] What's going on?
You still can't get a signal to Carter?

49:07.319 --> 49:09.488
[Jung Hee] Someone's blocking
the communications channel.

49:09.571 --> 49:11.865
First, let me identify the woman
who approached Carter.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.951
[man 2] The South is manipulating
the traffic lights.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.078
The bus will stop 50 meters ahead
for one minute.

49:16.161 --> 49:18.789
-Then we will be in range for the shot.
-[man] Take her down.

49:18.872 --> 49:21.833
[Jung Hee] We can identify her first,
there'll be time to take her out after.

49:21.917 --> 49:23.043
[man] Fire!

49:23.126 --> 49:24.169
[gun fires]

49:25.170 --> 49:27.422
[grunts, gasps]

49:28.715 --> 49:31.134
Run, Mike. Run before my men get here.

49:34.471 --> 49:36.139
[passenger 1] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

49:36.223 --> 49:37.307
[passenger 2] She got shot!

49:37.391 --> 49:40.394
[whimpering] Call an ambulance!

Hold your fire!

52:42.576 --> 52:43.869
That's Michael Bane!

52:43.952 --> 52:46.496
[agent] It doesn't matter who he is.
He's gone rogue.

52:46.580 --> 52:47.706
We have to take him out.

52:47.789 --> 52:49.291
[female agent] It's not his fault.

52:49.374 --> 52:52.836
He's just being used by the people
that are really pulling the strings.

52:52.919 --> 52:55.130
[agent] Yeah, well, that puppet
is about to kill Paul!

52:55.213 --> 52:57.048
Requesting permission to engage.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.551
[female agent] Please, sir, don't do this.

57:27.485 --> 57:30.321
[Jung Hee] There is an emergency
military airstrip at the end of the road.

57:30.405 --> 57:33.116
A plane is waiting there
to take you to North Korea.

57:55.305 --> 57:59.559
My name is Kim Dong-gyu, Director
of North Korean Relations at the NIS.

57:59.642 --> 58:02.103
I am responsible
for getting you to North Korea safely.

58:02.187 --> 58:05.565
[Jung Hee] We opened a communications
channel in the South as well.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.525
You've done well.

58:11.237 --> 58:12.363
Hey, Jung Hee?

58:13.281 --> 58:15.825
I don't think he trusts me. [chuckles]

58:16.493 --> 58:19.787
[Jung Hee] Director Kim will be
ensuring your safety during the flight.

58:21.498 --> 58:22.665
Come on. Let's board.

58:27.253 --> 58:28.796
The reporters will hassle you.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.215
Don't say a thing.

58:31.007 --> 58:33.593
Don't look at them either.
Keep looking forward.

58:34.594 --> 58:37.347
Even your slightest movement, Agent Lee,
may put this country

58:37.430 --> 58:40.141
could put Dr. Jung and South Korea
in a dangerous spot.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.520
[reporters clamoring]

58:43.603 --> 58:44.979
[reporter] Is it true that Ha-na's…

58:45.063 --> 58:47.315
We'll be flying with US reporters.

58:47.815 --> 58:49.234
Reporters will be on board?

58:49.317 --> 58:52.820
Yes, that way,
the entire world will be watching us.

58:52.904 --> 58:55.323
It'll keep the US government
from acting so reckless.

58:55.406 --> 58:56.699
[reporter] How did you find her?

58:56.783 --> 58:59.869
Please cooperate, as this was a choice
to ensure our safe arrival.

58:59.953 --> 59:03.289
Jung Ha-na,
kidnapped daughter of Dr. Jung Byeong-ho,

59:03.373 --> 59:04.666
reappeared today.

59:04.749 --> 59:06.876
Now, the South Korean government
gave no statement

59:06.960 --> 59:08.294
regarding the kidnapping itself,

59:08.378 --> 59:11.214
merely making a statement that reuniting
the doctor with his daughter

59:11.297 --> 59:13.174
is of the utmost priority.

59:13.258 --> 59:16.094
We will keep you updated
on further developments in this story,

59:16.177 --> 59:19.639
which will hopefully result
in Ha-na's safe return to North Korea.

59:24.477 --> 59:27.480
[Director Kim] Hey now,
you shouldn't smoke with a child on board.

59:28.439 --> 59:30.775
[official] Hey, look,
there's no need to be so uptight.

59:30.858 --> 59:32.110
[laughs]

59:32.193 --> 59:36.406
[inhales deeply] You will be staying here
as we make our way to North Korea.

59:37.407 --> 59:38.741
Here, this way.

59:40.368 --> 59:42.370
[tense music playing]

59:43.121 --> 59:45.790
Hey, you gotta be Ha-na.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.126
Ha-na.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.510
Come on, all right?

59:59.679 --> 1:00:02.223
To start, you should both see our medic.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:03.766
TREATMENT ROOM

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:08.187
Hello. Welcome.

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:18.239
If you'll remove that,
we can start the treatment.

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:25.413
You can take that seat.
The plane is taking off soon.

1:00:34.464 --> 1:00:36.382
[reporter] Excuse me,
we have an interview.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:39.052
-[agent] After the treatment.
-Well, we'll do the interview later.

1:00:39.135 --> 1:00:40.345
[Director Kim] Sorry, later.

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:46.100
You both can change
once your injuries are mended.

1:00:46.184 --> 1:00:47.644
Okay. Disinfect it.

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:53.566
Don't worry. It won't hurt anymore, okay?

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:00.907
Mister, are you okay?

1:01:02.950 --> 1:01:03.868
I'm okay.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.245
Are you okay?

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.122
I'm okay too.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:09.666
[Carter] Hmm.

1:01:14.379 --> 1:01:16.089
Why is your hand like that?

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:23.721
I can't remember.

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:27.308
I think I was with my daughter.

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:32.146
Well, um, aren't you remembering now?

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:36.401
When I see this scar on my hand,

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.529
it's as if I can hear a child crying.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:45.284
Though, she might not
make it through today.

1:01:46.744 --> 1:01:48.204
My daughter, that is.

1:01:50.623 --> 1:01:52.291
What's your daughter's name?

1:01:55.086 --> 1:01:55.920
Yoon Hee.

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:58.214
"Yoon Hee."

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:02.093
But I'm here, so it'll work out.

1:02:03.553 --> 1:02:06.264
I'm the cure, right? A human cure.

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:08.975
[laughs]

1:02:09.058 --> 1:02:11.686
[man] All right, the treatment is done.

1:02:12.270 --> 1:02:14.021
Excellent. Thank you.

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:17.442
All right. Why don't you put these on?

1:02:21.487 --> 1:02:24.866
Ha-na, you should get changed as well,

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:27.034
after Mr. Carter is done. [chuckles]

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:31.873
Once you arrive in North Korea,
your mission will be finished.

1:02:31.956 --> 1:02:35.042
I sincerely hope
that the cure is completed in time,

1:02:35.126 --> 1:02:37.587
so that your child can be saved.

1:02:39.714 --> 1:02:41.549
Was this mission really my choice?

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:44.510
So that I could save my daughter?

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:46.596
[Director Kim] You'll get an answer
to that question

1:02:46.679 --> 1:02:48.347
once your mission is complete.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:50.516
Until then, don't let down your guard.

1:02:51.267 --> 1:02:52.351
Remember this.

1:02:53.144 --> 1:02:57.774
there may even be individuals
on this plane who are after Ha-na.

1:02:58.441 --> 1:03:01.402
[Carter] Didn't you say
that the US can't interfere anymore?

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:03.696
[Jung Hee] We have reason to believe

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:07.158
that the CIA may have ordered
other forces to move in on Ha-na.

1:03:07.241 --> 1:03:11.245
It's possible North-Korean personnel
may be involved, wanting to start a coup.

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:15.082
[Carter sighs] The CIA contacting
the spy organization makes sense,

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:18.002
but what do you mean
by a coup within North Korea?

1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:22.632
Well, we suspect
the virus may have been spread,

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:26.636
by those who want
the current regime to collapse.

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:33.434
Until Ha-na is safely reunited
with her father Dr. Jung,

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:36.062
don't trust anybody.

1:03:38.397 --> 1:03:40.233
Don't even trust me. [scoffs]

-[Carter] What's going on?
-Don't worry. I'll go investigate.

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.494
[breathes deeply]

1:03:54.205 --> 1:03:56.707
-What's going on?
-We've lost contact with the cockpit.

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:58.084
What?

1:03:58.876 --> 1:04:00.503
[frantic music playing]

1:04:01.254 --> 1:04:03.965
-[agent] Director Kim, what's going on?
-[reporter] Is there a problem?

1:04:06.384 --> 1:04:07.885
Hurry, we need a medic!

1:04:11.764 --> 1:04:12.890
What happened?

1:04:12.974 --> 1:04:15.935
They both just collapsed.
But they just drank coffee.

1:04:20.565 --> 1:04:21.524
Coffee?

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:23.651
Sir, I didn't do it.

1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:26.529
Look, I brought the coffee
but that was it.

1:04:26.612 --> 1:04:28.614
[suspenseful music playing]

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:45.506
No, you can't! Who else can fly the plane?

1:04:46.007 --> 1:04:47.758
Look at his bloodshot eyes.

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:51.137
This plane's going down in ten minutes
if it's a mutated variant.

1:04:52.430 --> 1:04:53.848
What do you think you're doing?

1:04:53.931 --> 1:04:57.727
Director Kim tried to kill
Comrade Pilot and Comrade Assistant Pilot.

1:04:58.561 --> 1:05:01.606
If we don't kill them, we will all die!

1:05:01.689 --> 1:05:03.190
Everyone, calm down.

1:05:03.274 --> 1:05:05.151
First we'll confirm they're infected.

1:05:05.234 --> 1:05:06.068
Medic!

[device beeps]

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:25.630
[official] How does it look?

1:05:26.130 --> 1:05:26.964
Technically,

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:31.510
in normal situations, this level
wouldn't be considered high enough,

1:05:31.594 --> 1:05:33.930
but considering
the altitude and cabin pressure,

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:35.598
technically, this is an infection.

1:05:35.681 --> 1:05:37.808
[Director Kim]
So, are they infected or not?

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:40.102
Give us more time to observe it.

1:05:40.186 --> 1:05:43.356
At least give us five minutes
to get a proper reading.

1:05:43.439 --> 1:05:45.900
What's the difference
in killing them now or then?

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:50.196
Hang on. But his hair roots are strong.

1:05:50.279 --> 1:05:52.782
Don't you know it's too late
once the hair starts falling out?

1:05:52.865 --> 1:05:55.576
The protocol states that
reading times are to be observed.

1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:58.746
If anything happens in the meantime,
they will instantly be shot.

1:06:04.919 --> 1:06:06.712
The blinds, they aren't working.

1:06:08.714 --> 1:06:11.092
Why is the medical room
emergency lights off?

1:06:12.718 --> 1:06:13.761
Out of my way.

1:06:14.887 --> 1:06:16.555
-Move!
-[official] Director Kim!

1:06:16.639 --> 1:06:18.516
Director Kim, what's the situation?

1:06:18.599 --> 1:06:20.768
Due to what felt like extreme turbulence,

1:06:20.851 --> 1:06:23.062
we appear to have lost power on board.

1:06:23.145 --> 1:06:24.772
Now, that is an extremely…

Only you can hear what I'm saying.

1:06:28.818 --> 1:06:31.278
In the cargo compartment,
I am sensing the heat signatures

1:06:31.362 --> 1:06:33.239
of what appear to be an adult and Ha-na.

1:06:33.906 --> 1:06:36.701
-The cargo compartment?
-[Jung Hee] You need to head there.

1:06:36.784 --> 1:06:39.120
-[agent] Let's go.
-[man] This is why South Korean bastards…

1:06:39.203 --> 1:06:40.746
-You can never trust them.
-[agent] Ha-na!

Ri Cheol Ju, you son of a bitch!

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:49.231

[Cheol Ju gasps]

Who is it?
Who's the head of the North Korean coup?

1:07:55.863 --> 1:07:58.866
Who spread this virus? Who created it!?

1:07:58.949 --> 1:08:01.327
[laughs]

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:04.872
Do you really think North Korea would
make this mess just to die

1:08:05.414 --> 1:08:08.084
and when we don't even have a vaccine yet?

1:08:08.167 --> 1:08:09.585
[laughs]

1:08:09.668 --> 1:08:11.712
But have you considered that maybe,

1:08:12.630 --> 1:08:16.467
it's the South that wanted the coup?

1:08:16.550 --> 1:08:18.928
[laughs]

1:08:19.011 --> 1:08:20.387
I guess you,

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:24.600
are just another facet of this
to make it more interesting.

1:08:24.683 --> 1:08:27.686
Now that's enough of your bullshit.
Just answer me.

1:08:27.770 --> 1:08:28.604

You're embarrassing yourself,

1:08:42.785 --> 1:08:46.831
You believe those stereotypes, huh?
You think I have loyalty to the North?

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:51.460
What, 'cause I'm from North Korea?
Is that it then?

1:08:51.544 --> 1:08:53.295
[laughs]

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:54.213
What?

1:08:55.506 --> 1:08:58.259
Do you think there's only one spy
like him in the North?

-Ri Cheol Ju, you asshole!

Up there in the North,

1:09:13.816 --> 1:09:17.528
the people call South Korea
an American colony.

1:09:18.487 --> 1:09:19.572
The thing is,

1:09:20.948 --> 1:09:23.325
after having met these Americans,

1:09:24.410 --> 1:09:26.579
it looks like being on their side,

1:09:27.663 --> 1:09:29.665
is more than worth it for me.

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:32.001
America.

Listen, Director Kim was just a CIA spy
that was planted here.

1:12:29.762 --> 1:12:31.847
He was trying to take Ha-na away.

American imperialist bastards,

1:33:18.634 --> 1:33:20.970
can be destroyed in one strike.

1:34:57.400 --> 1:34:59.402
[vehicle beeping]

1:35:23.134 --> 1:35:25.886
Enjoy that breath. It'll be your last.

1:35:26.429 --> 1:35:27.388
Who knows, huh?

1:35:27.888 --> 1:35:32.059
You might walk away a North Korean hero
and ex spy agent,

1:35:32.810 --> 1:35:35.146
or you might become barbecue in this fire.

1:35:35.229 --> 1:35:37.940
Don't worry though, it'll be decided soon.

1:35:38.691 --> 1:35:39.608
Comrade hero,

1:35:40.109 --> 1:35:42.862
if you've been good to your wife,
you might live.

1:35:42.945 --> 1:35:44.947

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:45.382
[soldier panting]

1:36:47.051 --> 1:36:48.260
Please let me live.

1:36:49.053 --> 1:36:51.055
[phone ringing]

1:36:52.765 --> 1:36:54.141
[Carter] Pick up the phone.

1:36:54.225 --> 1:36:55.684
[ringing continues]

1:37:01.315 --> 1:37:02.525
Put it on speaker.

1:37:06.111 --> 1:37:07.196
Yeah.

1:37:07.279 --> 1:37:08.781
[Jong Hyeok on phone] Where is Carter?

1:37:09.490 --> 1:37:11.909
[panting] Waiting to be thrown
into the pit.

1:37:12.576 --> 1:37:15.246
-What's the order?
-[Jong Hyeok] Wait a bit longer.

1:37:15.871 --> 1:37:16.997
[soldier] Yes, sir.

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:21.335
Kim Jong Hyeok, tell me where he is.

1:37:22.837 --> 1:37:27.174
[soldier] He's at, uh, the Sinuiju
Chemical Factory's biochemical facilities

1:37:27.258 --> 1:37:29.969
about 1.5 kilometers to the north--

[solemn music playing]

1:38:59.683 --> 1:39:00.684
[grunts softly]

1:39:11.987 --> 1:39:13.989
[solemn music continues]

1:39:52.194 --> 1:39:58.117
I'M GOING TO CALL YOU
KEEP ME ON THE PHONE - CARTER

1:40:01.954 --> 1:40:03.956
[line ringing]

1:40:14.299 --> 1:40:16.552
[Jong Hyeok] You look like
you still haven't decided.

1:40:17.636 --> 1:40:19.096
Don't overthink it.

1:40:27.062 --> 1:40:29.064
You need to save your family,

1:40:30.649 --> 1:40:32.651
Carter, yourself, and your daughter.

1:40:34.194 --> 1:40:35.904
I can guarantee their safety.

1:40:37.573 --> 1:40:40.075
Let us go, like the party had promised.

1:40:41.368 --> 1:40:43.537
I don't care what you do here,

1:40:44.747 --> 1:40:46.206
what you do with North Korea.

1:40:48.667 --> 1:40:50.294
Well, maybe you should care.

1:40:52.004 --> 1:40:53.130
For instance,

1:40:54.256 --> 1:40:55.758
if you two work with the Americans

1:40:55.841 --> 1:40:59.053
and were to say all sorts of bullshit
to the entire world,

1:41:00.554 --> 1:41:01.638
how will I look?

1:41:04.516 --> 1:41:06.518
I'll most likely get furious

1:41:07.561 --> 1:41:09.772
and drag you all here again

1:41:11.732 --> 1:41:15.235
to bury you all deep within
that anthrax incinerator

1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:19.406
But then again… [sighs]

1:41:20.032 --> 1:41:23.368
…if Carter Lee,
who saved the North from the virus,

1:41:24.244 --> 1:41:26.038
were to stand with me and my men,

1:41:26.914 --> 1:41:29.625
your husband will become a new idol

1:41:30.501 --> 1:41:32.419
in uniting all of North Korea.

1:41:32.503 --> 1:41:33.504
[scoffs]

1:41:34.671 --> 1:41:35.672
Idol, huh?

1:41:38.634 --> 1:41:42.513
You just want a puppet, don't you,
who will do as you please?

1:41:43.305 --> 1:41:47.726
Look, if it means he survives
then being a puppet is a small price.

1:41:48.477 --> 1:41:49.478
Am I wrong?

1:41:52.356 --> 1:41:53.607
Lieutenant General.

1:41:56.110 --> 1:42:00.239
As I'm looking at you, threatening me
that you'll kill my husband,

1:42:01.949 --> 1:42:03.200
I'm not seeing

1:42:03.826 --> 1:42:05.035
any new world

1:42:06.161 --> 1:42:08.122
for the North Korean people.

1:42:14.419 --> 1:42:17.297
I was certain you'd been blinded by a man,

1:42:19.299 --> 1:42:22.177
but you've been blinded
to your immediate future as well.

1:42:33.564 --> 1:42:35.107
I can't plan the future

1:42:37.109 --> 1:42:38.902
of the People's Republic

1:42:39.903 --> 1:42:42.114
with someone who's as blind as you are.

1:42:43.448 --> 1:42:45.450

This is the room. Yoon Hee is in here.

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:52.226
-[Carter] Where is she?
-Huh? No, where is she?

1:43:52.309 --> 1:43:54.311
This has to be the right room.

-[Carter] This child…
-She's our daughter!

1:44:03.987 --> 1:44:06.114

Ha-na.

1:44:33.308 --> 1:44:34.476
It's all right.

1:44:34.559 --> 1:44:36.353
These people are just researchers.

1:44:36.436 --> 1:44:38.522
[Jung Hee] Doctor, our daughter…

1:44:43.902 --> 1:44:45.779
[Dr. Jung] You've been infected as well.

1:44:45.862 --> 1:44:48.323

Seven minutes ago, a train operated
by the… the Chinese government

1:48:28.126 --> 1:48:31.004
left Ryung Gye for Dandong,
carrying the infected.

1:48:31.671 --> 1:48:34.257
Not even the North Korean government
can interfere with that train,

1:48:34.341 --> 1:48:36.468
so we need to stop it.

1:48:37.302 --> 1:48:40.138
But we need to get your memory back first.

1:48:41.348 --> 1:48:42.182
Doctor.

1:48:42.724 --> 1:48:44.893
If you open his stitches,
you'll see a device.

1:48:44.976 --> 1:48:47.646
If you plug this into it,
his memories will return.

1:48:53.068 --> 1:48:54.236
"BD-7."

-[Carter] Yoon Hee!

1:49:36.653 --> 1:49:38.738
-[Yoon Hee] Dad…
-[Carter] I'll get Ha-na to the North.

1:49:38.822 --> 1:49:40.699
Dr. Jung is with me at the moment.

1:49:40.782 --> 1:49:42.367
[Jong Hyeok] Yoon Hee's been infected.

1:49:42.450 --> 1:49:45.579
Just a bit longer. We're almost there.

1:49:58.883 --> 1:50:00.176
[vehicle doors slamming]

1:50:06.683 --> 1:50:10.020
The country is falling into ruins
because of the virus.

1:50:11.104 --> 1:50:14.232
So do you think it wise
that our Comrade hero of the Republic

1:50:14.316 --> 1:50:17.235
is abandoning the country
during a time such as this?

1:50:18.778 --> 1:50:20.405
Let us go. I beg you.

1:50:21.906 --> 1:50:23.283
Lieutenant General, please.

1:50:23.867 --> 1:50:25.243
Just let us go, please.

1:50:26.620 --> 1:50:29.164
So you still haven't come
to your senses, Comrade.

1:50:30.373 --> 1:50:31.625
Have you forgotten

1:50:32.459 --> 1:50:35.211
that having your child
was the party's decision?

1:50:37.255 --> 1:50:38.882
Please tell your superiors

1:50:39.591 --> 1:50:43.261
if you… if you swear
to release our family,

1:50:44.471 --> 1:50:45.930
I'll get Ha-na to the North.

1:50:47.515 --> 1:50:48.975
Do you know what you've said?

1:50:49.643 --> 1:50:50.685
What it will do

1:50:52.020 --> 1:50:54.439
to you, your daughter, and your wife?

1:50:55.690 --> 1:50:59.110
No one knows specifically
if the CIA moved Ha-na out already,

1:50:59.778 --> 1:51:02.989
or if she's still hidden somewhere
in South Korea.

1:51:03.948 --> 1:51:07.410
I can find her if I become bait
and approach the CIA on my own.

1:51:08.328 --> 1:51:10.455
I don't side with the North or America,

1:51:10.538 --> 1:51:12.624
so it won't be an international conflict.

1:51:17.003 --> 1:51:18.880
How can I trust you'll do it though,

1:51:20.215 --> 1:51:23.051
an agent who got plastic surgery

1:51:25.011 --> 1:51:26.262
to spy for seven years?

1:51:27.764 --> 1:51:30.809
If you run, and abandon
your wife and your daughter,

1:51:31.726 --> 1:51:36.272
that will only mean exposure
of our entire operation.

1:51:39.275 --> 1:51:40.151
Then, um…

1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:44.364
BD-7 can erase everything that I know.

1:51:46.282 --> 1:51:47.826
Use it and send me South.

1:51:47.909 --> 1:51:49.744
Carter. [breathing shakily]
