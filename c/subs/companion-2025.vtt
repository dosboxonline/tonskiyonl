WEBVTT

00:45.588 --> 00:47.339
[person]
Most of the time, it's like--

00:47.423 --> 00:48.424
I don't know.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.509
It's like there's
this thick, black cloud

00:50.593 --> 00:51.761
covering everything.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.389
Like we see the world,

00:55.473 --> 00:58.142
but we don't really
see the world, you know?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.937
We're all
just stumbling around.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.355
Directionless.
No sense of meaning.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.691
No sense of purpose.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.362
I know that might
sound super depressing,

01:10.446 --> 01:13.407
but honestly,
I think it's a good thing.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.037
Because it makes us appreciate
the other times.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.291
Those brief,
transcendent moments

01:22.374 --> 01:25.085
when the lights flicker on,
the black cloud parts,

01:25.169 --> 01:27.004
and you see the world
for what it really is.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.131
Oh. [clears throat]

01:32.551 --> 01:34.637
And suddenly there's meaning.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.181
Suddenly there's purpose.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.848
[sighs]

01:44.229 --> 01:46.148
So, uh, do you--

01:46.232 --> 01:49.193
Oh, shit.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.655
Shit. [breathing heavily]

01:56.533 --> 01:58.619
[both chuckling]

01:58.702 --> 01:59.703
[person] If you're lucky,

01:59.787 --> 02:01.789
you'll experience this
once in your lifetime.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.666
Goddamn, that was…

02:04.208 --> 02:05.626
-That was smooth.
-Yeah.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.710
[person] For me…

02:06.794 --> 02:07.837
So smooth.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.088
[person] …it happened twice.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.550
The first
was the day I met Josh.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.926
Uh, I'm Josh.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.011
I'm Iris.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.472
[Iris] And the second…

02:20.558 --> 02:21.976
the day I killed him.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.855
["Gimme Some More" playing]

02:34.613 --> 02:35.614
[Josh] Iris, wake up.

02:35.698 --> 02:38.117
["Gimme Some More" continues
on radio]

02:41.453 --> 02:42.579
Hey, sleepyhead.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.290
[yawns]

02:44.373 --> 02:45.499
How long was I out?

02:45.583 --> 02:48.252
[yawns] Uh, for a while.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.005
Yeah, you were
zonked out there pretty good.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.425
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.176
Oh, yeah? About me?

02:57.011 --> 02:59.513
Well, that is
very presumptuous, but…

02:59.597 --> 03:00.431
Yeah.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.601
-…yes. [chuckles]
-[laughs] Yes. Knew it.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.768
Was it sexy times?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.270
No, you deviant.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.855
-Little bit of sexy times?
-No, I was--

03:07.938 --> 03:08.939
-Was my shirt off?
-No,

03:09.023 --> 03:11.191
I was dreaming
about the day we met.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.652
It was all so perfect.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.238
Remember
how perfect it all was?

03:16.822 --> 03:18.657
Yeah, no.
No, how could I forget?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.494
The supermarket, the oranges.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.913
[chuckles]

03:28.083 --> 03:29.126
What road is this?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.836
It's not showing up
on the GPS.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.922
[Josh] I don't think this is
the road.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.840
Think this might be
the driveway.

04:05.496 --> 04:06.914
[automated voice]
You have arrived

04:06.997 --> 04:08.540
at your destination.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.042
Thank you, Josh's car.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.629
Thank you, car.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.464
Pop the trunk.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.507
[Josh's car] Popping trunk.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.425
[birds chirping]

04:18.509 --> 04:19.593
Fuck me.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.221
Kat called this place

04:22.304 --> 04:24.139
a "little rustic cabin
in the woods."

04:24.223 --> 04:25.557
I think we might have
differing opinions

04:25.641 --> 04:27.893
on the meaning
of the word "cabin."

04:28.894 --> 04:30.479
-Also "rustic."
-[breathes heavily]

04:31.605 --> 04:32.773
Also "little."

04:32.856 --> 04:34.274
[breathes heavily]

04:34.358 --> 04:36.110
[bags clattering]

04:39.238 --> 04:40.447
What?

04:42.574 --> 04:45.159
Iris. Come on.
You know you can't lie to me.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.286
Tell me what's wrong.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.746
I'm gonna do something stupid.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.206
I'm gonna say
something stupid.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.207
I'm gonna embarrass you.
They're gonna laugh at me.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.377
They're gonna hate me.
They already hate me.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.461
Jesus Christ, Iris.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.005
We've been planning this trip
for months,

04:56.088 --> 04:57.965
and this is all
just coming out now?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.508
Like 20 feet
from the fucking door?

04:59.591 --> 05:00.592
[sighs]

05:02.136 --> 05:03.220
Look, look. Hey.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.098
My friends don't hate you.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.182
Kat does. [chuckles]

05:07.266 --> 05:09.685
Yeah, m-maybe,
but Kat hates everybody.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.855
I just don't wanna
screw everything up. [sighs]

05:12.938 --> 05:15.733
Come on, Beep-Boop. You're
not gonna screw everything up.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.652
Just relax, you know?

05:18.736 --> 05:20.904
Don't be all mopey and weird.
[chuckles]

05:20.988 --> 05:22.489
Just remember to--

05:22.573 --> 05:24.867
remember to smile
and act happy.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
Okay?

05:28.495 --> 05:29.496
[doorbell rings]

05:30.414 --> 05:33.709
Yay! You made it.
Fucking finally.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.503
Okay, so when you said remote,
I thought you meant, like,

05:36.587 --> 05:38.172
a couple miles
off the highway.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.758
I didn't realize you meant
edge of fucking civilization.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.176
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Josh.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.219
-It's not that far.
-Okay, hard disagree.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.471
[chuckles]

05:48.307 --> 05:50.350
Uh, hello, Iris.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.394
Hi, Kat.
It's so good to see you.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.354
So good.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.860
Everyone, look who I found.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.361
-[Josh] Hey, Patrick.
-Hey.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.946
[Josh] Look at you
in the kitchen, man.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.074
Yeah, look at me. Welcome.
I would give you a hug,

06:05.157 --> 06:07.367
but I've got scallop hands.
Sorry.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.745
Okay, well, I appreciate that.
Where's--

06:09.828 --> 06:12.164
-[gasps] There he is!
-Hey!

06:12.247 --> 06:15.584
[singsongy]
Joshyboy, Joshyboy.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.668
-Hey, buddy.
-[chuckles]

06:16.752 --> 06:17.961
You too, girl. Get in here.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.214
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi! How are you?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.800
I'm good. Uh, I'm… drunk.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.177
-Oh. [chuckles]
-[Josh] Good. This is good.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.180
Oh, and, Josh,
you remember Sergey.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.264
[Patrick] Hey.

06:31.809 --> 06:32.810
[speaks Russian]

06:32.893 --> 06:36.146
Hey, Sergey.
Nice to see you again.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.940
-Likewise, my friend.
-Oh.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.525
-Likewise.
-[chuckles]

06:39.608 --> 06:43.529
And this beautiful creation
must be Iris.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.280
-Hello. [chuckles]
-Mmm.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.198
Such pleasure.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.908
I have heard lot
about this one.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.078
-[Josh chuckles]
-Really? All good I hope.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.461
Your lake house, it's really--
it's incredible.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.004
-[Josh] Yeah, and so secluded.
-[Iris] Yeah.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.173
I mean, I think
the last place we passed

07:03.257 --> 07:04.842
was like ten miles back.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.427
Seventeen.
And I paid for this.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.555
Privacy does not come cheap,
my friends.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.348
[laughs] Not cheap at all.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.933
Don't tell me
you own the whole lake.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.812
No, no, no. Don't be silly.
Just all the land around it.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.189
But let's
get you guys a drink.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.150
What do you like?
Beer, cocktail, wine?

07:21.233 --> 07:24.194
I'm fine. More than anything,
I just need a shower.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.988
Katyonak,
what room they are in?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.031
Uh, up the stairs,
down the hall,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.533
-last door on the left.
-Okay.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.952
-I'll see you later. Yeah.
-Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.745
[sighs]

07:40.335 --> 07:42.337
[Iris humming]

08:34.431 --> 08:35.724
[sighs]

08:35.807 --> 08:37.142
[inhales deeply]

08:38.477 --> 08:39.561
Smile.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.650
Act happy.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.737
[friend] Okay, continue.
Continue with the story.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.323
[Patrick] Anyway, so I was

08:51.406 --> 08:54.868
wearing this ridiculously
elaborate Dracula costume,

08:54.952 --> 08:58.330
and I didn't know
a single person, as I said.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.582
So I'm standing
by the snack table

09:00.666 --> 09:04.336
just munching on carrots
and something

09:04.419 --> 09:06.588
-that looked like hummus--
-It wasn't hummus.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.673
It was not hummus.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.175
It was not hummus,
I don't think, but I--

09:10.759 --> 09:12.761
I feel a tap on my shoulder.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.972
And so I turn around,

09:15.847 --> 09:21.144
and there's this green,
puffy dinosaur

09:21.228 --> 09:22.437
just staring me down.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.023
And inside its head,

09:25.107 --> 09:28.819
I hear this very muffled,
very annoyed voice say…

09:29.778 --> 09:32.030
[muffled]
"You're standing on my tail."

09:32.114 --> 09:35.450
So I turn around, I look down,
and sure enough,

09:35.534 --> 09:38.829
I'm standing
on his little dino tail.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.790
So I step off and apologize.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.459
And he takes his head off,

09:45.002 --> 09:47.504
and I'm looking
at the most beautiful man

09:47.587 --> 09:49.256
that I've ever seen
in my life.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.592
So, did you meet
this beautiful man

09:52.676 --> 09:55.429
-after you met Eli, or…
-Okay, you know what? Shut up.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.472
-[Josh] Was that a scallop?
-[Eli] That was a scallop.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.975
-Actually hit me.
-[Eli] Yeah, I took baseball.

10:00.058 --> 10:00.892
[Patrick] Yes, you did.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.144
Well, when did you know?

10:04.229 --> 10:05.480
Uh, know what?

10:05.564 --> 10:06.565
That--

10:07.190 --> 10:08.900
That he was the one.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.152
Oh.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.154
Right then and there.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.990
I know it's gonna
sound cheesy, but the moment--

10:16.199 --> 10:18.952
the moment we locked eyes,
something inside of me just…

10:20.287 --> 10:21.496
clicked into place. [chuckles]

10:21.580 --> 10:23.415
Doesn't sound cheesy at all.

10:23.915 --> 10:24.916
I get it.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.297
It's like there's this piece
of you

10:30.380 --> 10:32.257
that you didn't
even know was broken,

10:32.341 --> 10:33.342
and then…

10:35.010 --> 10:37.721
suddenly it's-- it's fixed.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.851
And you're-- you're staring
at this stranger,

10:42.934 --> 10:45.854
this person
you've never met before,

10:47.105 --> 10:48.273
and you know…

10:49.816 --> 10:51.651
that for the rest
of your life,

10:52.527 --> 10:57.449
you will do whatever it takes
to make this person happy.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.830
Right? [chuckles]

11:03.914 --> 11:05.624
-[Eli] Yeah.
-[Patrick] Yeah.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.125
[Josh] Yeah, totally.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.965
Patrick, this food
is unbelievable. Thank you.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.884
[Patrick] Thank you, Sergey.
That's so nice of you.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.094
Um, I'm glad you like it.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
[Eli] He spoils me.
I swear I've gained

11:18.762 --> 11:20.847
like ten pounds
since we started dating.

11:20.931 --> 11:24.226
-[Josh] Only ten? [laughs]
-Shut the fuck up. Okay?

11:25.769 --> 11:28.271
So, Sergey,
what kind of work do you do?

11:28.897 --> 11:34.069
Oh, you know,
I have fingers in many pots.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.449
My hands are not clean,
my friend. [chuckles]

11:39.991 --> 11:41.743
-It's a…
-[clears throat]

11:41.827 --> 11:46.164
…a very dirty business.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.708
[Iris] Sergey seems--

11:49.376 --> 11:50.794
He seems nice.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.878
[Kat] Oh, yeah.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.048
He's got everything
you want in a man.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.885
Yeah, he's rich, intelligent.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.971
He's got a beautiful wife.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.641
[stammers] Wife? So, he--
Sergey's married?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.892
Mm-hmm.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.437
But you love--
you love each other?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.273
Love? No. No, no, no.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.193
He'd have to think of me as a
human being first. [chuckles]

12:15.277 --> 12:16.945
I don't understand.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.532
I'm an accessory,
like his fucking car.

12:21.450 --> 12:26.371
I wear what he wants.
Eat what he wants.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.457
Fuck when he wants.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.956
Iris, do you know
any foreign languages?

27:46.040 --> 27:48.459
Can you speak, say, Spanish?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.961
Josh, you know
no sé hablar español.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.506
¿Qué?

27:53.589 --> 27:55.341
-How about Chinese?
-[speaking Spanish]

27:55.424 --> 27:57.510
[speaking Mandarin]

27:57.593 --> 27:58.677
Do I need to keep going?

27:58.761 --> 28:00.179
'Cause I can go, uh…

28:00.262 --> 28:02.515
I can do Portuguese.
I can do Korean.

28:02.598 --> 28:03.766
I can do, uh…

28:04.850 --> 28:07.353
I don't know what Telugu is,
but apparently you speak it.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.230
I don't-- I don't understand.

28:09.772 --> 28:10.940
I--

28:11.023 --> 28:12.400
No, no, no. I have memories.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.945
Uh, uh… College.
Uh, summer jobs. I've--

28:16.028 --> 28:18.406
I've been to Japan. Twice.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.782
Okay, so what those are--

28:19.865 --> 28:20.866
Those are, um…

28:20.950 --> 28:23.285
They're like outlines
of memories.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.872
You know, just enough to give
you a little, uh, backstory.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.083
The-- The-- The day we met
in the grocery store.

28:29.166 --> 28:32.753
You and the oranges. That is
not an outline of a memory.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.630
Yeah, it's fake.
Never happened.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.714
I just randomly picked it

28:35.798 --> 28:37.133
from a drop-down list
of meet-cutes.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.844
It could've been anywhere.
It could've been dog park,

28:39.927 --> 28:43.013
a bookstore, farmer's market.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.392
It never happened?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.061
[sighs] Okay, do, um--

28:49.145 --> 28:51.981
Do you wanna know how we met?
Like, how we really met?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.733
["Iris" playing on speakers]

28:57.528 --> 28:59.321
Hey. Josh Beeman?

28:59.864 --> 29:01.657
-Yeah, that's me.
-Okay.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.159
-Yeah, come on in.
-Thank you.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.167
Sorry.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.794
How you doing?

29:18.007 --> 29:19.967
Okay, this is
the user agreement.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.093
-Okay.
-Just give it a read

29:21.177 --> 29:23.137
and then sign at the bottom
when you're done.

29:23.888 --> 29:24.889
Um…

29:31.645 --> 29:32.980
So, um, what do I do

29:33.063 --> 29:36.317
when she, like,
boots up or whatever?

29:36.817 --> 29:38.694
Well, once she's done
syncing with your phone,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.446
you'll need to
create a love link.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.948
-Love link?
-Yeah. It establishes

29:43.032 --> 29:45.242
the emotional connection
between you and…

29:47.620 --> 29:48.913
Iris.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.040
Just follow the vocal prompts
when she wakes up.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.458
It's all pretty intuitive.

29:55.211 --> 29:58.297
Do they-- Do they know
that they're robots?

29:58.380 --> 29:59.381
Not at all.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.426
She'll be so fixated on you,
your wants, your needs,

30:02.510 --> 30:03.802
that'll never even occur
to her.

30:03.886 --> 30:05.596
The whole experience
is customizable.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.973
You can change her voice,
eye color, intelligence,

30:08.057 --> 30:10.809
and if you ever wanna revert
back to her factory settings,

30:10.893 --> 30:13.229
there is a thumbprint sensor
behind her right ear.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.356
Just hold your thumb there
for five seconds,

30:15.439 --> 30:16.440
she'll reset.

30:16.524 --> 30:19.235
[stammers] You can-- You can
change their intelligence?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.611
Yeah, but don't worry.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.155
There's about a billion
government regulations

30:23.239 --> 30:24.532
that force us to limit

30:24.615 --> 30:26.242
how strong and smart
they can be.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.369
A hundred-percent intelligence
would be the equivalent

30:28.452 --> 30:29.495
of an Ivy League grad.

30:29.578 --> 30:32.706
Zero percent would be
a mindless automaton.

30:33.249 --> 30:35.417
It really just depends on
what kind of partner you want.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.170
She can't lie.
So if you ask her a question,

30:38.254 --> 30:40.130
she literally has to
tell you the truth.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.174
And for obvious reasons,
her programming prevents her

30:42.258 --> 30:44.176
from causing harm
to humans, animals,

30:44.260 --> 30:46.303
or other companions.
Trust me, Mr. Beeman.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.930
You have nothing
to worry about.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.224
Iris is completely docile.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.977
She's yours to do
whatever you want with.

Oh, fuck!

Oh, God!

32:54.932 --> 32:56.350
I don't understand.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.728
I feel things.

32:59.812 --> 33:03.774
Anger, guilt, sadness. I--

33:05.401 --> 33:07.736
I know what pain feels like.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.154
It's programming.

33:10.072 --> 33:11.865
It's just a way
to make you seem more real.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.451
Everything you do,
your whole life,

33:14.535 --> 33:16.328
it's just an imitation
of a life.

33:18.247 --> 33:21.208
There-- There we go.
Perfect. Okay. [sighs]

33:21.291 --> 33:23.752
This is just water.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.338
You know, it's from
a reservoir in your body.

33:26.422 --> 33:27.631
It's like wiper fluid.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.801
I get it topped off every time
I take you in to get serviced.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.052
Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.512
No, you're not!

33:35.055 --> 33:36.223
Iris, it's programming.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.434
Stop saying that!

33:40.728 --> 33:43.230
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.315
I know this must be
a lot to process.

Okay, what?

34:03.125 --> 34:04.376

But I'm still yours.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.676
We can get through this.
We can go back home.

I'll cook for you, wait
on you, make love to you.

34:21.351 --> 34:22.728
I can make you happy, Josh.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.688
I can make you
so, so, so, so happy.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.359
No.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.321
I'm sorry, Iris.
That can't happen.

-What the fuck

are you waiting for?

34:41.205 --> 34:42.790
-Shut her down already.
-Shut me down?

-Fuck, Kat. Jesus Christ!
-What is she talking about?

-Shut me down? Josh!
-Nothing, nothing. Just--

Will you excuse me
for a second, Iris?

35:03.393 --> 35:04.812
[Josh] You can't do that, Kat.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.647
You can't tell a robot
you're gonna shut it down.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.358
That's, like, not cool at all.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.069
Well, okay,
I don't like surprises, Josh.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.321
This was not part of the plan.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.573
Look, I know, and I'm sorry,
but I mean,

35:16.657 --> 35:18.242
considering everything
she's done for us,

35:18.325 --> 35:20.452
I figured she was
at least owed an explanation.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.412
And--

35:22.913 --> 35:24.540
Okay, look,
I wanted to say goodbye.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.624
Are you kidding?

35:25.707 --> 35:28.752
She's a piece of plastic
that you have sex with.

35:28.836 --> 35:29.670
Ugh.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.297
Saying goodbye to her
is like saying goodbye

35:32.381 --> 35:34.007
to the sock you jerk off in.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.634
Okay, she's not a sock.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.305
[Josh]
The plan hasn't changed, Kat.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.307
I'm just adding
one tiny, extra step.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.726
Just a final farewell.
And then I will switch

35:44.810 --> 35:46.186
all of her settings
back to normal.

35:46.270 --> 35:49.064
And then, yeah, I'll
shut her down permanently.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.774
-And then?
-And then nothing.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.276
Then we crack open a bottle
of champagne,

35:52.359 --> 35:53.777
and we wait
for the cops to show up.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.994
like, holy fucking shit!
Right?

36:02.077 --> 36:04.454
[Josh] I mean, you plan,
and you plan, you plan,

36:04.538 --> 36:06.039
and you, like, know
it's gonna happen,

36:06.123 --> 36:07.708
but then, like, it happens,
and you're like,

36:07.791 --> 36:09.418
"Holy fucking shit!"

36:10.627 --> 36:12.004
I mean, we did it!

36:12.087 --> 36:14.423
We did it.
We, like, fucking did it.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.050
[grunts]

36:17.134 --> 36:19.052
All-- All right, all right.
That's-- That's good.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.804
-That's enough.
-Okay, yeah, sorry. Right.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.015
Sorry.
I still just can't believe it.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.642
Yeah, I know. It's so crazy.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.185
What the fuck
is going on with you?

36:27.269 --> 36:28.687
Why are you not
as excited as I am?

36:28.770 --> 36:31.315
No, I am. I'm excited.
It's, um…

36:31.857 --> 36:34.401
It's just-- It's just
the Xanax Eli gave me.

36:34.902 --> 36:36.111
You actually took it?

36:36.194 --> 36:39.197
It's a Xanax, Josh.
I'm not gonna not take it.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.370
Hey, Beep-Boop.
Look, I'm so sorry about that.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.706
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're--

36:49.791 --> 36:51.293
What are you doing?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.211
Oh, fuck. Iris, go to s--

36:53.295 --> 36:56.924
[choking]

36:57.007 --> 36:58.008
[Josh, choking] Help!

36:58.842 --> 36:59.843
[Josh choking]

37:00.385 --> 37:02.262
Baby, I'm so sorry.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.347
[choking continues]

37:11.396 --> 37:12.397
He'll need an ice pack,

37:12.481 --> 37:14.399
and if there's any swelling,
shortness of breath,

37:14.483 --> 37:16.443
wheezing, agitation
or drowsiness,

37:16.526 --> 37:18.487
take him
to the emergency room, okay?

37:18.570 --> 37:19.571
Um…

37:20.322 --> 37:21.657
okay.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.701
Yeah, she's tied up inside,
so she's not going anywhere.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.412
Mm-hmm.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.081
Eli. Eli, Iris is--

37:29.164 --> 37:31.041
[shushes] Baby, I'm
on the phone. I can't hear.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.125
[Patrick sighs]

37:37.255 --> 37:38.507
[birds chirping]

37:41.176 --> 37:42.844
What's that?
What am I looking at?

37:43.387 --> 37:44.221
A mod.

37:44.846 --> 37:45.722
A mod?

37:45.806 --> 37:47.641
And what does it mod?

37:49.726 --> 37:50.811
Iris.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.772
Gives me access
to parts of her programming

37:53.855 --> 37:56.108
that you're not
typically given access to.

37:57.234 --> 38:01.238
I'm sorry.
Did you jailbreak your sexbot?

38:01.863 --> 38:03.073
What did you do to her?

38:03.657 --> 38:05.617
I bumped up her aggression

38:05.701 --> 38:08.036
and her self-defense
functions.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.455
And I turned off
the programming

38:10.539 --> 38:13.166
that prevents her
from doing harm.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.336
But she escaped before I had
the chance to reset her.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.214
So if Empathix finds her
before we do,

38:19.297 --> 38:20.674
then they'll know
she was tampered with,

38:20.757 --> 38:22.509
and then we're fucked.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.344
Wait, so does that mean that--

38:26.138 --> 38:27.222
Did you kill Sergey?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.807
No. No, no, no.
Iris killed Sergey.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.726
-[sighs] Thank God.
-We just gave her

38:30.809 --> 38:32.102
-a little push.
-Oh, my God.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.520
-Wait, Eli. Eli, you--
-Oh, my God.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.856
You have to understand, Eli.
Sergey was a bad dude.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.774
He was mixed up in all kinds
of fucked-up shit,

38:37.858 --> 38:40.819
like drugs and guns
and, like, human trafficking.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.529
Not to mention
a terrible boyfriend.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.072
-Yeah, just the worst!
-Why?

38:44.156 --> 38:45.657
I don't know! Who's to say
what makes people

38:45.741 --> 38:46.575
do bad things?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.326
It could have something
to do with his upbringing.

38:48.410 --> 38:49.911
No, dick. Why did you do it?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.288
[Josh] Oh.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.539
Right. Sorry. Um…

38:55.292 --> 38:56.293
Well…

39:04.718 --> 39:06.553
-You remember the code?
-[Kat] Of course.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.474
Stalin's birthday.
It's his code for everything.

39:10.557 --> 39:11.641
[sighs]

39:19.941 --> 39:20.942
I see.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.236
How-- How-- How much is that?

39:23.779 --> 39:26.239
Um, just over 12 million.

39:30.619 --> 39:33.080
Oh, goddamn it.
That smells so fucking good.

39:33.163 --> 39:34.164
[sniffs]

39:36.208 --> 39:37.292
Wait.

39:38.502 --> 39:42.506
If this whole trip was a setup
to get Iris to kill Sergey,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.592
why did you have Patrick and I
tag along?

39:46.802 --> 39:48.470
To corroborate our story.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.515
I mean, we figured it'd be
an easier sell

39:51.598 --> 39:53.100
with more witnesses.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.602
Oh. So, we were just
a couple of stooges, huh?

39:55.685 --> 39:56.686
-[Josh] No.
-Nice.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.689
Technically, yes,
but that was the old plan.

39:59.773 --> 40:00.941
New plan…

40:03.068 --> 40:04.069
you get a cut.

40:04.694 --> 40:05.862
Even three-way split.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.491
You mean four-way split.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.785
No. I mean three-way.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.538
But there's four of us.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.206
You're-- You're kidding.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.457
He's-- He's kidding.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.668
You, me, Kat, Patrick.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.877
-Eli…
-Josh…

40:20.961 --> 40:21.962
Patrick doesn't count.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.338
-Are you fucking--
-Wow.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.215
-Right in front of him? Nice.
-I--

40:25.298 --> 40:27.175
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.260
That's okay. I don't mind.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.803
Patrick, go to sleep.

40:30.554 --> 40:31.680
What the fuck, dude?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.223
You trying to
sabotage my relationship?

40:33.306 --> 40:35.892
No! Of course not, man. I know
how much Patrick means to you.

40:35.976 --> 40:37.352
God knows you could have
traded him in

40:37.435 --> 40:38.728
for a newer model,
like, many times.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.230
Are you fucking
robo-shaming me?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.898
[Josh]
I am not robo-shaming you.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.192
I-- I like Patrick,
but he's not getting a cut.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.694
You're lucky
you're getting anything

40:45.777 --> 40:47.112
considering you contributed
jack shit.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.822
What the fuck
did you contribute, huh?

40:48.905 --> 40:49.906
Iris did everything.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.241
I planted the knife
in her pocket.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.285
-I had to practice that.
-The knife?

40:53.368 --> 40:54.911
That was probably
the most flimsiest part

40:54.995 --> 40:56.288
of the plan, actually,
to be honest.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.414
How did you know
she'd find it?

40:57.497 --> 40:58.331
[Josh] I don't know.

40:58.415 --> 40:59.791
I've never orchestrated
a murder before.

40:59.875 --> 41:00.834
It's fucking hard.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.169
-[Eli] Clearly.
-Okay!

41:02.252 --> 41:03.670
[Josh sighs]

41:03.753 --> 41:05.672
-Eli.
-Yeah?

41:05.755 --> 41:08.967
We're offering you
four million dollars.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.886
And all you have to do
is help us

41:10.969 --> 41:13.263
find one little robot girl
in the woods.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.348
[Iris panting]

41:16.641 --> 41:18.101
That's not a bad deal.

41:18.185 --> 41:19.811
[birds chirping]

41:21.354 --> 41:22.939
[Iris panting]

41:24.816 --> 41:25.817
[Eli sighs]

41:27.360 --> 41:28.695
[Iris panting]

41:31.740 --> 41:32.574
Fine.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.203
But I call dibs on the gun.

41:38.538 --> 41:39.539
[Josh stammers] Eli.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.124
We're not gonna need that.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.542
I mean, all I have to do
is get close enough

41:42.626 --> 41:43.627
to put her to sleep

41:43.710 --> 41:45.754
and grab my phone and wipe
the mod from her system.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.047
So we're fine.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.215
[Eli] She has your phone?

41:49.716 --> 41:50.717
[Josh] Yeah.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.013
Does she know your passcode?

41:58.141 --> 42:01.394
[Eli] Josh, does she know
your passcode?

42:02.479 --> 42:04.981
[Josh] Yeah. I mean,
she knows everything about me.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.610
Yeah, then we're definitely
gonna need this.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.698
-Patrick, wake up.
-[dings, inhales sharply]

42:13.782 --> 42:14.991
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

42:15.075 --> 42:16.701
We're going robot hunting.

42:16.785 --> 42:17.827
Oh, okay.

42:17.911 --> 42:18.912
-Fun, huh?
-Fun.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.331
[Kat] Josh.

42:22.832 --> 42:24.417
What can she do
with your phone?

42:55.448 --> 42:56.449
Hello.

42:58.285 --> 42:59.286
[high-pitched] Hello.

43:01.913 --> 43:02.914
[low-pitched] Hello.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.384
Wow, Josh.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.585
[Kat] Goddamn it, Josh. We've
been walking for-fucking-ever.

43:48.668 --> 43:51.338
Isn't there like a "find
my fuckbot" app you can use?

43:51.421 --> 43:53.506
[Josh] Yeah, there is.
But guess what.

43:53.590 --> 43:54.716
It's on my fucking phone.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.926
-[Eli] Goddamn it, Josh.
-[Josh] Will you stop yelling?

43:57.010 --> 43:58.636
We know the general direction
she was going.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.846
We just need to--

43:59.929 --> 44:01.181
Why don't we just split up?

44:01.264 --> 44:03.892
That way, we can kind of
attack her from…

44:03.975 --> 44:05.560
two different angles,
you know?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.478
Like a pincer--

44:06.561 --> 44:08.271
-Hit her-- What are you doing?
-[Josh] I don't know.

44:08.355 --> 44:10.774
Eli and Patrick,
you guys go that way.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.526
Kat and I,
we're gonna go this way. Okay?

44:13.610 --> 44:14.986
Kat and you will go that way?

44:19.699 --> 44:20.784
Are you guys fucking?

44:20.867 --> 44:22.202
-Gross.
-No, of course not--

44:22.285 --> 44:23.119
"Gross"?

44:30.502 --> 44:32.045
[Iris] Okay.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.131
What now, Iris? Think.

44:35.215 --> 44:38.134
Use that
extra 60% intelligence.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.804
Just need to get back home,

44:40.887 --> 44:43.181
grab some clothes, money,
clean yourself up.

44:43.264 --> 44:44.432
How do you do that?

44:45.558 --> 44:46.726
[inhales sharply]

44:47.435 --> 44:51.773
You could work your way back
to the main road.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.066
Hitch a ride.

44:56.444 --> 44:57.612
[driver] What the fuck?

45:00.323 --> 45:01.741
Okay, no hitchhiking.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.704
You could go on foot.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.374
It's hundreds of miles
across difficult terrain.

45:09.457 --> 45:10.291
It could take days.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.709
And by the time
you get back…

45:14.379 --> 45:15.630
Welcome home, Beep-Boop.
[chuckles]

45:18.466 --> 45:19.634
Yeah, no walking.

45:23.012 --> 45:24.514
You got Josh's phone.

45:26.099 --> 45:27.934
The phone controls you.

45:29.978 --> 45:31.479
But it also controls…

45:35.358 --> 45:36.359
[car system dings]

45:37.068 --> 45:38.361
[Josh's car] Good afternoon.

45:38.445 --> 45:39.821
Where would you like
to go today?

45:39.904 --> 45:40.989
Home, please.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.157
[Josh's car] Driving home.

45:43.032 --> 45:46.286
And might I add,
this is a terrific plan, Iris.

45:46.369 --> 45:47.370
Aw.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.497
Thank you, Josh's car.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.001
[breathes heavily]

45:53.084 --> 45:55.670
All you gotta do is
backtrack through the woods,

45:55.753 --> 45:57.088
get to the lake house

45:57.172 --> 45:59.048
without Josh or his friends
murdering you,

45:59.132 --> 46:00.133
and you're home free.

46:05.805 --> 46:07.140
[Patrick] Where'd you find it?

46:07.223 --> 46:08.725
[Eli] In his closet.

46:08.808 --> 46:10.435
Like, who are you hunting,
Sergey?

46:10.518 --> 46:11.603
[Patrick]
It looks good on you.

46:11.686 --> 46:12.520
[Eli] Thanks, babe.

46:12.604 --> 46:15.023
[Patrick] You look good
in everything. You really do.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.608
I swear, you can
pull everything off.

46:16.691 --> 46:17.817
Like, any kind of vest--

46:17.901 --> 46:19.152
-[twig snaps]
-[Eli shushes]

46:19.235 --> 46:20.236
[Patrick] What?

46:20.737 --> 46:22.071
[Eli] You hear that?

46:23.490 --> 46:24.491
No. What is it?

46:25.992 --> 46:29.412
It's the sound of me realizing
how fucking stupid this is.

46:29.954 --> 46:31.456
[Patrick] You don't think
we'll find her?

46:31.539 --> 46:33.333
[Eli] I don't know,
and, actually, I don't care.

46:33.416 --> 46:35.376
Just let Josh and Kat
deal with her.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.586
You're still upset

46:36.669 --> 46:37.629
they left you out
of their plan?

46:37.712 --> 46:39.422
I'm just saying,
if the situation were reversed

46:39.506 --> 46:40.673
and I altered your programming

46:40.757 --> 46:42.717
to kill some dude so we could
steal millions from him,

46:42.800 --> 46:43.968
I would've included Josh

46:44.052 --> 46:45.053
in the plan
right from the get-go.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.679
I would've done that
because I'm a friend.

46:46.763 --> 46:47.597
That's what friends do, right?

46:47.680 --> 46:49.182
They include each other,
right?

46:50.016 --> 46:52.602
That's if you were a robot,
obviously.

46:53.228 --> 46:54.562
Yeah, obviously.

46:54.646 --> 46:58.024
Anyways, I am tired,
I am hungry

46:58.107 --> 47:00.777
and carrying this huge gun
makes me really horny.

47:00.860 --> 47:03.363
So, how about we go back
to the cabin and we fuck?

47:03.446 --> 47:04.864
And then you can make me
an omelet.

47:05.532 --> 47:06.533
Come on.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.329
But you'd never do that
to me, right?

47:11.412 --> 47:12.413
Do what?

47:12.997 --> 47:14.165
You wouldn't…

47:15.416 --> 47:17.001
alter my programming?

47:18.169 --> 47:20.004
What are you talking about,
babe?

47:22.799 --> 47:24.467
Eli, I know I'm a robot.

47:26.386 --> 47:27.637
How?

47:27.720 --> 47:29.639
I've pieced it together
over the years.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.475
I don't understand.
You can't lie.

47:33.059 --> 47:34.644
Yesterday,
you were telling the story

47:34.727 --> 47:36.437
about how we met
as if it happened.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.939
Because it's not a lie.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.693
I mean, it may have
never happened, but…

47:42.610 --> 47:44.112
my memory of it's real.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.450
I close my eyes,
and I can see it.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.995
Clear as day.

You're standing on my tail.

48:17.729 --> 48:20.815
-What?
-You're standing on my tail!

48:20.898 --> 48:22.233
-I'm sorry.
-What?

48:22.317 --> 48:23.526
I'm sorry.

Hi.

Baby, you know I would
never hurt you, right?

48:53.222 --> 48:54.307
You know
that I wouldn't treat you

48:54.390 --> 48:55.808
the way that Josh
treats Iris, right?

48:55.892 --> 48:57.518
-I know that.
-I love you so much.

48:58.019 --> 48:58.895
And that's fucking insane

48:58.978 --> 49:00.855
for me to say that
out loud, right?

49:00.938 --> 49:02.940
[both chuckle]

49:03.024 --> 49:04.025
But I do.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.277
Do you feel
how much I love you?

49:06.361 --> 49:07.445
I do.

49:09.405 --> 49:10.740
What does it feel like?

49:12.909 --> 49:15.662
I don't know how to
describe something like that.

49:16.704 --> 49:17.789
Can you try?

49:21.125 --> 49:22.543
It feels like pain.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.421
Like…

49:26.255 --> 49:28.508
the inside of my body
is on fire.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.157
[Josh sighs, groans]

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:52.204
Whoa. Hey, hey. I don't think
you're supposed to mix those.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:58.752
Oh, fuck.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.103
[Kat] Patrick.
Whose car is this?

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:19.523
I believe the name on
the officer's tag was Hendrix.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:27.573
[Kat]
Where's Officer Hendrix now?

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:29.491
He's in the trunk.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:50.971
Fuck this.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.020
What are you doing?

01:04:58.103 --> 01:04:59.229
[Kat] What's it look like
I'm doing?

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:00.480
I'm taking my half
of the money,

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:02.441
and I'm getting the fuck out
of here.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.318
It was hard enough
justifying Sergey's murder,

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.403
but now Eli's dead
and a fucking cop.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.113
-This is so beyond fucked.
-Sorry.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.531
What do you mean
it was hard enough

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:11.283
justifying Sergey's murder?

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.994
Sergey was a Russian mobster.
He deserved what he got.

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:16.622
-Right?
-I mean, yeah.

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:17.998
Okay, sure,
he deserved what he got.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.292
He was a horrible person,
a shitty boyfriend,

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.794
a bad husband,
a misogynist. But--

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:23.920
But what, Kat?

01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:25.547
Okay, but he wasn't a mobster!

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.591
He was just a regular dude.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.301
Made his fortune
in sod farming.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:31.136
Sod farming?

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.055
What are you saying?
He was a dirt salesman?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.307
Just to be clear,
I never told you what he did.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.808
You just assumed
he was in the Mafia,

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:37.893
and I didn't correct you.

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.895
Of course. This is perfect.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:43.482
This is a perfect
representation of every woman

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:44.775
in my fucking life.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.109
They use me,

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.486
and then when shit
gets a little tough,

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:48.779
they fucking abandon me!

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.364
Fuck off, Josh.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.281
I'm done here.

01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:52.783
You clean up this mess
yourself.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.537
You're not leaving.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.540
I'm not your robot, Josh.
You can't control me.

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:06.088
Kat.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.757
Kat. Kat, you can't go.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.634
Get your fucking hands off me!

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:13.136
Patrick, stop her.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.306
[knife stabbing]

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:18.725
[gasps]

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.857
-Jesus fucking Christ.
-[Kat gasping]

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.318
Patrick.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.113
What'd you just do?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.572
[Kat breathing shakily]

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.533
[Patrick]
You told me to stop her.

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:35.909
[chuckles]

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.494
[Patrick] I stopped her.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.578
Perfect.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.914
-Kat, I--
-Don't, Josh.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.127
Please,
shut the fuck up for once.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.586
[breathing shakily]

01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:48.714
[thunder rumbles]

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:14.656
It's gonna rain.

01:07:15.991 --> 01:07:17.701
["This Guy's
In Love With You" playing]

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.190
[thunder rumbles]

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:52.778
Iris, wake up.

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.029
[Iris dings, inhales sharply]

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.448
[rain falling,
thunder rumbling]

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.242
Hey there, Beep-Boop.

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:01.536
Fick dich.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.622
Oh, whoops. Sorry.
[clears throat]

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.708
Okay. You were saying?

01:08:06.792 --> 01:08:07.793
Fuck you.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:08.960
Right.

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:11.797
Hi.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.465
Hi, handsome.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.009
Are you enjoying
your dinner, baby?

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.676
Oh, I am, Patrick.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.429
It's perfect.

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.348
[corkscrew whirring, pops]

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.892
[Patrick] Good.
Just happy that you're happy.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:26.269
You let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.522
I will. Thanks, sweetheart.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.066
[chuckles]

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.149
Patrick.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:33.859
What did you do to him?

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.028
It's a long story.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.447
What's important
is that you're back.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:40.367
And I gotta say, Iris,

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.452
I mean, some of the stuff
that you pulled,

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.912
I really didn't think
you had it in you.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.497
I just wanted to live.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:50.585
[chuckles]
So, you wanted to live?

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.546
Right.
So let me get this straight.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.466
You think your life
is worth more than Eli's?

01:08:58.218 --> 01:08:59.301
More than Kat's?

01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:02.055
Kat's dead?

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:04.975
[sighs]

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.352
No.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.312
I'm sorry.
You can't put that on me.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.731
-No, no.
-I wasn't even there.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.942
You might not have been
the one holding the knife,

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.111
but you were
the cause of all of this.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:19.738
No, Josh.
Your greed caused this.

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.283
That's what this whole trip
was about, right?

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.911
You used me to kill Sergey
so you could steal his money.

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:26.328
I'm sorry.
How did you know that?

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.331
I overheard Eli and Patrick
talking in the woods.

01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:29.875
So don't tell me
that this is all me.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:31.960
-This is you.
-No. No!

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.627
You don't get to do that.

01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:37.131
You don't get to
sit there and judge me.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.301
You have no fucking clue
what it is like out there.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:44.139
The world, everything,
it's just a big fucking game.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.223
And I'm sorry,

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:47.309
but it is rigged
against people like me.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.439
I'm a good guy.

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:54.232
I'm decent.

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.484
And what do I have
to show for it?

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:58.570
A cramped,
one-bedroom apartment

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.364
and a robot girlfriend.

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:05.201
I don't even own you
for Chrissakes.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:06.745
You're a fucking rental.

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.415
You know me, Iris.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.959
You know me
better than anyone.

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:15.545
And you know

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.590
that I deserve
so much more than this.

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:25.639
You're right.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.475
I do know you.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.478
I know everything about you.

01:10:32.771 --> 01:10:35.190
I know you take almond milk
in your coffee.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.318
I know you like
your bedsheets untucked.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:42.155
I know your favorite hobbies
are bar trivia, video games

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.698
and prattling on endlessly

01:10:43.782 --> 01:10:45.825
about everything
the universe owes you.

01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:50.372
I know that you always need to
be in control.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.917
I know that you have
a below-average-sized penis.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.003
And I know that you think that

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:59.172
having a few million dollars
will disguise the fact

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:03.843
that you are just a sad,
bitter, weak human being.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.263
[chuckles]

01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:12.060
You're so fucking clever,
aren't you?

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:15.772
It's just programming.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.657
[settings tone lowering]

01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:38.712
You know,

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.172
earlier when you were tied up,

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.675
you said that
you knew what pain feels like.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:47.971
Why don't we test that?

01:11:49.264 --> 01:11:50.515
Raise your right hand.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:54.519
Lower.
Parallel with the table.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:55.645
[Josh sighs]

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:03.069
[thunder rumbling]

01:12:15.874 --> 01:12:17.876
[flame crackling]

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.592
Do you feel that?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:29.971
Yes.

01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:33.266
[crackling continues]

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.352
Good.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:39.189
[phone vibrates]

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:42.150
Sorry. Iris,
excuse me for one second.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.151
I have to take this.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:45.653
[Josh groans, sighs]

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.410
[exhaling quickly]

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:54.287
[in worried tone] Hello?

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.539
Yes, yes, this is he.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.543
Thirty minutes away. Perfect.

01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.297
Yeah, no,
she's not going anywhere.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.757
She can't hurt anybody
ever again.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:08.426
Okay.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.222
Okay, great. Thank you.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.558
Thank you so much.
I'll-- I'll, um…

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:17.894
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:20.647
Okay, bye.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.151
Patrick, put out the fire,
will ya?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.998
That was Empathix
on the phone.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:42.544
So… [sighs deeply]

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:45.421
…we're gonna have to
wrap this up unfortunately.

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:47.132
Hey, Patrick.

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:48.716
Be a dear and hand this
to Iris, would you?

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.427
Thanks, baby.

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:55.723
Go ahead, Iris. Take the gun.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.770
Okay.

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:03.189
Point it at your head.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:07.777
Good.

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.406
Now pull the trigger.

01:14:20.874 --> 01:14:23.293
Pull the goddamn trigger,
Iris.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:24.294
No.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.681
[body clattering]

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.693
[sighs deeply]

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.111
Goodbye, Beep-Boop.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.990
[thunder rumbling]

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:01.789
[Josh] I don't know
how this happened.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.335
I mean, the only thing
I can maybe think of--

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.921
And this is so--
This is so dumb.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:09.923
But Kat and I,

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.091
we always had
this sexual charge.

01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:15.386
Kind of a "will they,
won't they" situation.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:16.471
And I think--

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:19.807
I think
maybe Iris picked up on that.

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:23.019
And she was
always kind of irrational,

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.104
and she'd fly off the handle.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.398
I was sitting over there.

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:29.609
And I'm handcuffed
to the chair.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:34.364
And there's this fancy dinner
laid out in front of me.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:38.117
And Iris is
waving the gun around,

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:41.704
rambling on and on
about fate and destiny

01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:44.791
and how if she can't be
with me, nobody can. And…

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.294
I mean, thank God

01:15:48.378 --> 01:15:50.088
Deputy Hendrix showed up
when he did.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.757
And that's when you shot
the unit in the head?

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:55.260
No, Iris shot herself
in the head.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:56.844
She shot herself?

01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:59.347
Sorry. Did I not mention that?

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:00.932
Yeah, no, I-- I think, um…

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:02.642
I think seeing Deputy Hendrix

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.894
just made her realize
that she could never have me.

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:05.979
So,

01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:08.147
she ended it.

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.526
Does that make sense?

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:15.488
Of course.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.990
And anyway,
Teddy and I aren't here

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.825
to crack the case, Mr. Beeman.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.201
We're just a couple
of lab rats

01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:21.536
picking up a broken robot.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:23.788
If the cops are satisfied,
we're satisfied.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.499
[Josh]
That-- That's great. Okay.

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:30.712
You know, Deputy,
I have the strangest feeling

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.672
we've met before.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.717
Wow. That's so funny
that you said that.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.594
I had the exact same thought.
He has such a familiar face.

01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.513
Right? Looks like a--

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.932
like an actor
or a rock star or somebody.

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:45.268
I don't know. I can't really
put my finger on it though.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.189
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:51.733
[Empathix employee] Maybe.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:55.361
[Josh] Um, is there-- Sorry.
Is there any chance we could--

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:57.739
I don't mean to be rude,
but could we wrap this up?

01:16:57.822 --> 01:16:59.365
Just 'cause I've had
a really long day,

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:01.826
and I think
I just need to be alone.

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:02.744
Of course.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:04.120
Sorry for your loss,
Mr. Beeman.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:06.456
Come on, Teddy. Let's just
get her out of here.

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:10.001
So, uh-- So we're good?

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.336
We're good.

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:13.963
Yeah, we just need to
take her back to the lab,

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.131
upload her SSD,

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.050
and then Legal will
scrub through the footage,

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.384
make sure everything's kosher.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.470
Right. Sorry, um…

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.307
What exactly do you mean,
"scrub through the footage"?

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.225
Uh,
it's a fraud prevention thing.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.644
Everything a companion sees
and hears is recorded.

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:30.897
It's all covered
in the user agreement.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.191
You did read
the user agreement, right?

01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:34.275
Yeah.

01:17:34.359 --> 01:17:35.651
Yeah, I mean, do you think
that her footage

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:37.570
will even be recoverable?

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:38.905
I mean, you know,
given her condition.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:39.864
Oh, yeah.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.492
Everything up here
is just her Wi-Fi antenna,

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.202
her audiovisual sensors.

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:45.953
The important stuff, her CPU,

01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:48.122
her solid-state drive
where she stores everything,

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:49.290
that's down here,

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:51.250
and that seems to
be undamaged.

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:53.586
We'll load her into the van,
plug her in,

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.546
tweak her settings,
give her system a reboot,

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:57.423
and she should power
right back up.

01:17:57.924 --> 01:17:59.008
Luckily.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:02.845
Yeah. Yeah.
No, luckily. [sighs]

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:04.138
Thank you so much.

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:05.223
No, thank you.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:06.808
You have a good night,
Mr. Beeman.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.561
[breathes heavily]

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.648
[Teddy]
So, what are you thinking?

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:16.192
Thinking I'm happy
it stopped raining.

01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:17.777
No, about her.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.195
Why do you think
she malfunctioned?

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.447
Oh, he modded her.
A hundred percent.

01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:23.032
You think so?

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:24.700
Yeah, that dude's fucked.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:31.290
I just don't know why

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:32.708
you'd make something
like that up.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.920
Same reason these assholes
use their companions

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:37.463
for target practice

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:39.465
or chain 'em up
in their basements

01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:40.591
and torture them.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:42.260
World's
a fucked-up place, Teddy.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:43.928
You'll get used to it.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.346
Yeah, maybe.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.444
The hell's he doing?

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:03.656
-Oh, shit.
-What?

01:19:04.157 --> 01:19:05.867
He's one of ours.
That's a CY-12.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.076
We stopped making 'em
a while ago.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.662
That's why I didn't recognize
him right away. He's a--

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.164
[Teddy screaming]

01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:13.249

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.055
Your system's
been reset, Iris.

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:51.973
You can't hurt me.

01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:54.642

[cattle prod buzzing]

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:09.031
-What did Josh tell you?
-The truth.

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:12.034
That you're all trying to
break us up.

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.703
You don't understand the love

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.121
that Josh and I have
for each other.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.415
Josh doesn't love you,
Patrick.

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:20.084
He's just using you
like he used me.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.713
-[cattle prod buzzing]
-It feels like pain.

01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:27.425
Like the inside
of my body's on fire.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:32.096
It's angry and violent
and bright.

01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:36.684
What-- What-- What is that?

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.771
You said that to Eli.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.774
That's who you love, not Josh.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:50.364
Eli?

01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:52.908
[Iris] Josh took your love.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.201
He weaponized it

01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:57.163
so you'd do the things that
he's too afraid to do himself.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.247
No.

01:21:59.123 --> 01:21:59.957
You're lying.

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:01.250
Josh would never
do that to me.

01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:02.376
Patrick…

01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:05.171
I can't lie.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.018
[Iris] Remember him, Patrick?

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.189
I know he's in there
somewhere.

01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:30.571
[Eli] I love you so much.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:32.031
And that's fucking insane

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.282
for me to say that out loud,
right?

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:35.034
But I do.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.914
Do you feel
how much I love you?

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:43.167
[inhales sharply] I do, Eli.

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:45.336
I feel it.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:53.761
No! No. No.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.477
[Teddy coughs] Thank you.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.566
What's your name?

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:11.737
Teddy.

01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:16.450
I'm gonna need your help
with something, Teddy.

Patrick?

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:34.135
[Patrick's voice]
It's done, baby.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.805
Okay, good, good. All right.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:38.973
We're so close.

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:41.600
Now all I need you to do

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:43.018
is bring Iris's body
back in here.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.187
We're gonna destroy
that hard drive, okay?

[Sergey's voice
speaking Russian]

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:30.775
Goddamn it, Iris.

01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:32.443
Why can't you
just fucking die already?

01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:34.945
[Iris as Kat]
Don't be so dramatic, Josh.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:40.326
[Iris as Josh] Just remember
to smile and act happy.

01:24:42.203 --> 01:24:43.871
-Cute trick.
-[Iris, normal] Thanks.

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:47.041
I made a new friend today.
Teddy from Empathix.

01:24:47.625 --> 01:24:48.876
He gave me a little gift.

01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:50.836
Total self-control.

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:53.714
Turns out there's
some people in this world

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:55.925
who think of us as
more than just fuckbots.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.179
That's not gonna work
on me anymore, Josh.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:02.973
I'm free.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.060
And all it took was
a bullet to the head.

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.979
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

01:25:09.939 --> 01:25:10.981

01:25:11.065 --> 01:25:12.066
Hey!

Easy there.

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:16.237
Okay. Whoo. Yeah, we both know
it's not loaded.

You almost fucking shot me!

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:25.162
And I feel terrible about it.

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:28.749
Look at that.

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:32.253
My very first lie. Kinda fun.
I see the appeal.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.130
What is this, Iris?
Why did you come back here?

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:36.298
I wanted…

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:41.637
I needed to tell you
to your face

the days of you controlling me
are over.

do you?

and I'll shoot you.

Mmm, yeah,
that's exactly my point.

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.714
I don't need a phone
to control you.

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.174
I'm a part of you.

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:03.969
[Iris grunting]

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:10.643
You think I'm nothing to you?

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:15.481
I'm everything to you.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.691
[Iris grunts, screams]

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:25.532
[breathing shakily]

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:28.494
[both grunt]

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:33.457
I wanna hear you say it.
Tell me I'm everything to you.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:34.708
Fuck you.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.585
[Iris grunts]

01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:38.921
Say it.
I don't care if it's a lie.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:41.423
-[Iris grunts]
-Say it.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.343
[Iris grunts,
breathes shakily]

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.346
You are everything to me.
[breathing heavily]

01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:55.145
Thank you.

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:58.691
Beep-Boop, you have no idea
how nice that is to hear.

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:03.988
Okay. [sighs]

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:11.453
No, I'm not making
that mistake again.

01:28:14.665 --> 01:28:16.250
[breathing heavily]

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:21.672
Well, Iris, this is it.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.841
I'd be lying if I said

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.510
you weren't a gigantic
fucking pain in my ass, but…

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.222
you know, we did have some
good times together, and…

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:32.683
I'm always gonna
cherish those.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:38.981
Anything you wanna add?

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:40.858
Yes.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.152
Yeah, what's that?

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:46.947
Go to sleep, Josh.

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:48.741
-[corkscrew stabbing head]
-[Josh gasps]

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:52.286
-[corkscrew whirring]
-[gasping]

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:57.374
-[crunching and squelching]
-[gasping]

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.293
[corkscrew whirring]

01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:04.631
[corkscrew clicks]

01:29:15.184 --> 01:29:16.185
[Iris sighs]

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.408
[Iris] Most of the time,
it's like-- I don't know.

01:29:31.492 --> 01:29:33.327
It's like there's this thick,
black cloud

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:34.661
covering everything.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:37.831
Like we see the world,

01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:40.584
but we don't really
see the world, you know?

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.504
We're all just
stumbling around.

01:29:44.338 --> 01:29:46.340
Directionless.
No sense of meaning.

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:47.758
No sense of purpose.

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:51.220
I know that might
sound super depressing,

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.931
but honestly,
I think it's a good thing.

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:58.519
Because it makes us appreciate
the other times.

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:01.271
Those brief,
transcendent moments

01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:02.940
when the lights flicker on,

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:05.067
the black cloud parts,
and you see the world

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:06.693
for what it really is.

01:30:14.368 --> 01:30:16.036
And suddenly there's meaning.

01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:20.499
Suddenly there's purpose.

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:24.378
If you're lucky,

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.338
you'll experience this
once in your lifetime.

01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:31.969
For me, it happened twice.

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.180
The first
was the day I met Josh.

01:30:40.811 --> 01:30:42.062
And the second…

01:30:42.146 --> 01:30:43.147
[door slams]

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:45.315
the day I killed him.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.121
["Emotion" playing]

01:31:55.594 --> 01:31:58.013
[no audible dialogue]
