a simple flick of the wrist…

[exhales heavily]

00:42.375 --> 00:43.501
It's ecstasy.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.504
Let me get this straight, you let a woman

00:46.588 --> 00:48.590
shave your balls with a straight razor.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.009
-I wasn't gonna let a man do it.
-It wasn't my point but--

00:51.092 --> 00:52.844
You have to use a straight razor.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.597
Electrics are like bloody chainsaws.
Who shaves you?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.806
This'll come as a shock to you,

00:56.890 --> 00:59.726
but most people don't like
sharp blades near their dicks.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.187
Tell me you trim, at least.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.564

-Oh, you savage.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.648
[Spike laughs]

01:05.732 --> 01:07.859
I prefer a more natural situation.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.362
That's just uncivilized.
At the very least, you could braid it.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.656
-[chuckling] Braid it!
-Although they're not long enough.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.616

01:14.699 --> 01:16.493

01:16.576 --> 01:18.661

01:19.204 --> 01:21.039
Yeah, it's actually happening.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.626
We're taking down The Syndicate.
Can you-- [choking]

01:28.713 --> 01:30.090
[woman over phone] Lee, are you okay?

01:30.173 --> 01:31.549

01:31.633 --> 01:32.884

Look at me.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.686
Look at me!

01:46.272 --> 01:47.690
How does it feel?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.901
[Spike] Pretty sure
it doesn't feel like ecstasy.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.029
Hard to tell, frankly.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.073
Look at this mess.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.492
This is why I was using a garrote.

01:57.575 --> 02:01.496
Well, you looked like you were struggling.
Besides, I, I felt inspired.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.706
[Spike] Clean up the blood.
Find something to--

02:03.790 --> 02:05.500
Why should I clean up? I did all the work.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.459
Are you kidding me?

02:06.543 --> 02:08.753
I am not cleaning up any blood.
You are doing all--

02:08.837 --> 02:10.463
It'll only be a minute, sweetie.
I just left some…

02:10.547 --> 02:12.006
-[gasps]
-[Spike] Don't.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.801
Come back.

-You didn't see anything here.
-[Brenda shudders]

02:27.814 --> 02:29.357
[Spike] Nod if you understand me.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.071
Run!

02:35.864 --> 02:38.199
What is the matter with you?
She could ID us.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.829
No kids. That's the code.

[Stax] You take care of our little problem
at the courthouse?

04:57.505 --> 04:58.423
Can you believe it?

04:58.506 --> 05:01.050
Turns out the judge never got
the paperwork from the DA.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.636
You'd think something that important
you'd follow through.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.138
-It's just lazy.
-[Vicious] Mm.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.306
[Stax] Good.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.057
So…

05:08.725 --> 05:11.811
Come on, you stupid piece of…

05:13.521 --> 05:14.897

05:15.940 --> 05:19.110
I mean, seriously, how hard would it be
to breed a couple of cows?

Everything is so goddamn phony these days.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.076
I've got another job for you two.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.662
If you want us to breed cows,
it's gonna take some time, sir.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.707
Sit down, wise guys.
You're making people nervous.

05:38.046 --> 05:38.921
[grunts]

05:39.964 --> 05:44.427
So, the Elders are looking
to negotiate a deal

05:45.928 --> 05:48.639
-with the Neptune cartel.
-Those animals?

05:49.891 --> 05:50.808
For what?

05:50.892 --> 05:55.355
For the fact that it rains diamonds
on Neptune, you believe that shit?

05:56.856 --> 06:00.026
The Syndicate wants a piece
in exchange for distribution.

06:00.109 --> 06:04.238
And you two are gonna
broker the deal with their man Ka-Ching.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.240
Us?

06:06.908 --> 06:07.867
Well, him, really.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.744
Isn't that more your job?

06:10.328 --> 06:11.871
Damn straight it's my job.

06:14.123 --> 06:18.002
Then again, it's also my job
to groom the likes of you.

06:20.671 --> 06:24.092
Brokering a deal of this magnitude
is what Capos do.

06:24.175 --> 06:28.721
And the sooner you learn how,
the sooner I get to pass the torch.

06:30.306 --> 06:34.519

on a fucking boat somewhere.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.899

is a real goddamn steak as God intended.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.153
So, don't fuck this up.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.824
Your future and mine hinge on it.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.285
Here's what you do…

06:52.078 --> 06:53.579
You open at 40%,

06:54.872 --> 06:55.832
you settle…

06:57.417 --> 06:58.459

This is a Capo's table.

He's all right.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.599
[Stax] That's only
'cause you clean up after him.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.352
This Neptune thing is a ripe deal.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.314
That's why they want you on it too,

08:01.814 --> 08:05.318

to make dead bang sure he doesn't blow it.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.630
You speak Russian?

16:04.713 --> 16:08.801
I learned a little,
knowing it was your native tongue.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.934
[racy music playing]

16:45.087 --> 16:45.963
[dings]

16:50.884 --> 16:51.802
Wait.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.139
-[Vicious clears throat]
-So, it's serious.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.558
It's evolving.

16:57.641 --> 17:01.562
Evolving? A dozen dates
and more on the horizon, that's serious.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.148
Fine. I stipulate to serious.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.693
And to think she's seen
parts of the real you

17:07.776 --> 17:10.362
and she's eager for more.
That's mind-boggling.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.409
[Vicious] We're going out later,
you should join.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.162
Uh… [chuckling] Why would I do that?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.748
She finds you funny somehow.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.000
You talk about me on dates?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.753
-During sex, actually.
-[laughs] Of course.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.712
[Stax] Come.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.805
Neptune Cartel's papers
just kicked up at the Martian Gate.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.098
It's time to deal.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.228
They do have rules of negotiation though.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.857
[Vicious] Which are?

17:46.940 --> 17:48.233
No iron.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.945
[Vicious] Are you joking?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.573
Not even.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.536
Take the team for backup,
but you two go in naked.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.331
-That's the plan.
-[Vicious exhales]

18:04.208 --> 18:05.209
That's great.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.294
We were born nudists.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.590
[ominous music playing]

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
[upbeat music playing]

18:30.192 --> 18:31.318
[Spike] He said no iron.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.613
We don't answer to Stax.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.156
I do.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.408
You worry too much.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.244
You don't worry enough.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.328
Hang on to this.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.503
It's absolutely stunning.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.798
I know, right?
He gave it to me on Saturday.

18:52.881 --> 18:57.094
Julia. I am so sorry. I just heard.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.179
-Heard what?
-Ana.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.598
She fired you.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.892
What? Where is she?

19:04.434 --> 19:05.394
She's backstage.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.650
Gren just told me I was fired.

19:11.733 --> 19:15.237
You know, there is one thing
I cannot abide by.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.447
Ana, is this about my seeing--

19:17.531 --> 19:20.117
People disobeying my rules.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.872
Congratulations.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.250
-[gasps]
-[Ana chuckles]

19:28.333 --> 19:30.544
Wait, what? I thought you really fired me.

19:30.627 --> 19:33.714
She did when I pointed out
that you were double-dipping.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.425
No more collecting the check
for doing hair and makeup.

19:36.508 --> 19:41.513
As of today, you only collect
as our new headliner.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.850
[gasps]

19:44.933 --> 19:46.476
[all cheering]

19:58.447 --> 19:59.865
[chuckles softly] Oh, wow.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.954
-You tried to cut off his fucking hand?
-[laughing]

20:06.038 --> 20:09.875
That inbred animal insulted me,
insulted The Syndicate.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.045
Did you think
this was just about diamonds?

20:14.504 --> 20:15.797
You did, didn't you?

20:15.881 --> 20:20.385
This was about The Syndicate
getting a foothold in the outer planets.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.804
-We can fix this, sir.
-I haven't even started with you!

20:22.888 --> 20:25.891
You're lug nuts!
The both of you are fucking lug nuts!

20:27.893 --> 20:29.853
The fix will come down from the Elders.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.188
You two will do nothing,

20:31.271 --> 20:35.108
you will sit on your fucking hands
and wait until they tell me what to do,

20:35.192 --> 20:39.238
then I will tell you what to do
and you will goddamn do it!

20:43.992 --> 20:45.244
[Vicious sighs]

20:45.327 --> 20:46.495
To hell with Stax.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.664
To hell with all of them.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.374
The Elders will see.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.626
They'll say I've done the right thing.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.837
We need to put the fear
into those Neptune savages.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.091
Whatever happens, happens.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.926
[Vicious] For you, maybe.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.970
For me, there are…

21:04.930 --> 21:06.056
expectations.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.558
Fucking Ka-Ching!

21:09.851 --> 21:11.812
[Julia] Hey! I made it.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.315
Where were you?

21:15.399 --> 21:19.319
Ah, there was a ship jam at the gate.
Took forever to clear.

21:22.739 --> 21:23.782
Everything okay?

21:24.574 --> 21:26.410
Yeah, just tough day at the office.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.122
-This place is amazing, by the way.
-[Vicious scoffs]

21:30.205 --> 21:31.832
Sarcasm doesn't suit you.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.125
[Spike] Hey, I was being serious.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.752
Everybody loves a dive bar.
How you doing tonight?

21:36.336 --> 21:37.629
-Excellent, thank you.
-[Spike] Yeah.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.631
[sighs]

21:39.715 --> 21:41.550
Ana made me a headliner.

21:43.093 --> 21:43.927
[Julia chuckles]

21:45.804 --> 21:48.015
Well, celebrations are in order. Cheers!

21:49.016 --> 21:50.809
-Cheers. Thank you.
-[Spike] Yeah

21:52.644 --> 21:53.729
Congratulations.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.897
-[upbeat music playing]
-[people cheering]

21:56.648 --> 21:58.150
[Julia] I love the Jupiter jig.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.238
Hey. Come on, dance with me.

22:04.072 --> 22:04.990
I don't think so.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.870
Dance with your girl. It'll cheer you up.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.580
You go, if you like this place so much.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.582
[Spike] I love places like this
for getting shit-faced.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.169
Which I prefer doing over dancing.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.174
All right, I guess it's on you.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.300
[chuckling] It's on me?

22:23.383 --> 22:24.634
[chuckles]

22:24.718 --> 22:25.635
All right.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.221
Just to be clear, I'm no dancer.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.349
You have feet, you can dance.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.184
I do have feet. [chuckles]

22:34.186 --> 22:35.604
-All right.
-Hey.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.564
Is he okay?

22:37.647 --> 22:40.609
I've never seen him so intense.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.403
Him? Oh, I've seen him intense,
that's not intense.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.405
That's… That's almost playful.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.698
[chuckles]

22:49.159 --> 22:50.827
So, how did you two end up partners?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.080
We met when we were kids.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.290
He saved me.

22:55.957 --> 23:00.045
He convinced his father to take me in,
build a life for me.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.173
We became brothers that day.

23:04.966 --> 23:10.097
I grew up on the streets, no family,
no prospects, no chance for survival. So…

23:10.972 --> 23:11.973
I'm sorry.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.226
Don't be. Don't be.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.645
Never thought there was any use
in denying the past.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.943
-You sure about this?
-Yeah. It's easy. Come on.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.153
Okay.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.573
-What do I do?
-Keep your eyes on me.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.075
-Excuse me, I'm sorry.
-[laughing]

23:31.368 --> 23:32.327
[Spike] Switch side.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.413
Tricky.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.040
[Julia chuckles]

23:37.124 --> 23:38.333
[Spike] Don't say I didn't warn you.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.294
Yep. Switching sides again.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.879
Getting the hang of it.
Getting the hang of it.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.387
-[Julia] Hey!
-[Spike] Hey!

23:59.604 --> 24:01.231
-Ooh!
-Oh.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.694
[camera flashes]

24:05.777 --> 24:06.820
[camera whirring]

24:06.903 --> 24:09.448
[photographer] Huh. Fun memories.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.409
[Julia clears throat]

24:13.285 --> 24:15.078
-Wanna get out of here? Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.290
I know a nightclub in Tharsis
where he'll be much happier.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.333
You're a good friend.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.087
[Spike and Julia laughing]

24:24.171 --> 24:25.881
[Julia] And then what happened?

24:25.964 --> 24:30.677
I go to shake the guy's hand
and that's when I see he's got no arms.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.762
-No.
-[Spike] I don't want to be rude.

24:32.846 --> 24:36.600
My hands are already out.
So I shook his head.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.602
-No, you didn't.
-[Spike] I did.

24:38.685 --> 24:41.396
-[Vicious] He did, that he did.
-Oh, my God! What did he do?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.814
He kicked the shit out of me.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.316
-You let him kick the shit out of you.
-[laughing]

24:44.399 --> 24:46.151
Of course I let him kick
the shit out of me.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.445
It was the least I could do!
The guy had no arms!

24:49.779 --> 24:51.156
Son of a bitch.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.240
-What?
-[indistinct chatter]

24:53.283 --> 24:56.620
-What is it?
-It's Ka-Ching. That Neptune scum.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.371
Vicious, wait.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.791
-Vicious, Stop!
-Vicious, what are you doing? Stop!

25:01.875 --> 25:03.585
-Vicious, stop! Stop!
-[Julia] Vicious, stop!

25:03.668 --> 25:04.836
[Julia gasps]

25:04.920 --> 25:07.047
Don't. Vicious!

25:07.797 --> 25:09.049
-[Vicious] You wanna fuck with me?
-[Ka-Ching screams]

25:09.883 --> 25:11.343
[sobbing]

25:13.011 --> 25:14.721
You wanna fuck with The Syndicate?

25:16.598 --> 25:18.475
[Spike] Stop! You're gonna kill him.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.684
[Vicious grunts]

25:19.768 --> 25:20.685
[Spike] Vicious, stop.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.856
[crying]

25:26.316 --> 25:28.777
Take her home. I'll deal with him.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.861
[breathing heavily]

25:30.612 --> 25:32.239
[breathing heavily]

25:33.114 --> 25:34.866
-[Vicious grunts]
-[crying]

25:45.043 --> 25:47.045
[car engine rumbling]

25:55.136 --> 25:56.304
[sighs]

25:57.639 --> 25:58.473
[exhales]

26:00.267 --> 26:01.309
My hands.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.562
They're shaking.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.647
I can't make it stop.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.107
[breathing heavily]

26:07.190 --> 26:09.192
[slow jazz music playing]

26:14.322 --> 26:15.407
[Ka-Ching groans]

26:15.490 --> 26:17.117
[coughs]

26:23.206 --> 26:24.165
Look at me.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.127
You're safe now.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.091
You're safe with me.

26:34.759 --> 26:35.760
[Julia] I know.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.901
[Ka-Ching] Please, no! Please!

26:52.694 --> 26:54.946
[both grunting]

26:59.117 --> 27:00.118
[Ka-Ching panting]

27:00.201 --> 27:01.244
[grunting]

27:02.329 --> 27:03.330
[sobbing]

27:17.552 --> 27:18.720
Yes.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.836
[music tempo increases]

28:22.283 --> 28:24.285
[music tempo decreases]

28:46.224 --> 28:47.851
[music fades]

28:56.317 --> 28:57.318
[chuckles]

28:57.944 --> 28:58.820
What?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.657
All my life…

29:05.243 --> 29:06.953
I've tried not to feel anything,

29:08.496 --> 29:10.165
to not care about anything…

29:12.292 --> 29:13.293
'cause if I did,

29:14.335 --> 29:15.587
I'd have something to lose.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.257
Something to be afraid of.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.386
And right now…

29:26.389 --> 29:28.850
all I'm afraid of is losing you.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.150
Is this a dream?

29:44.282 --> 29:45.784
[cell phone vibrating]

29:49.454 --> 29:50.538
Is that him?

29:53.124 --> 29:54.042
Worse.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.554
Were you with him?

30:08.890 --> 30:10.058
What are you talking about?

30:12.101 --> 30:15.104
I call you at 3:00 in the morning
and you're gonna fuck with me?

30:15.188 --> 30:17.941
Were you with your partner
when he killed Ka-Ching?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.901
It wasn't him. It was me. We ran--

30:19.984 --> 30:22.779
Spare me. He did it in the goddam street!

30:22.862 --> 30:25.031
As if nobody was gonna see.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.327
I know you think you owe him.

30:30.954 --> 30:35.375
But a sane person would wonder,
"How long are you gonna pay that debt?"

30:40.296 --> 30:42.382
I can fix it, sir. You just give me 24--

30:42.465 --> 30:45.093
No. No, no, no, it's over!
Vicious crossed the line.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.681
There are consequences!
The Neptune cartel wants him dead.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.478
-And if we don't comply--
-It's gonna be war.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.773
It's worse, it's last man standing.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.529
Everybody fucking knows…

31:06.114 --> 31:07.824
if there are survivors…

31:10.493 --> 31:12.120
the war never ends.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.708
His father, he's not gonna allow it.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.085
You'd think.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.300
Actually,

31:26.593 --> 31:28.261
Caliban sanctioned it.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.806
And he wants you to do it.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.478
-What?
-He wants you to do it.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.816
No, I won't.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.110
[Stax] Whatever. You don't want to?

31:44.694 --> 31:45.820
Somebody else will.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.574
He figured at least

31:51.200 --> 31:52.702
you'd make it quick.

32:24.901 --> 32:25.944
All my life…

32:28.780 --> 32:30.531
whatever trouble I got myself into…

32:32.408 --> 32:35.411
if I couldn't buy my way out,
you'd talk us out.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.999
If I failed my father's name…

32:41.209 --> 32:42.168
[sighs]

32:45.463 --> 32:46.798
My fucking father.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.052
[sighs]

32:53.596 --> 32:56.307
You know, he made me watch
the night my mother jumped.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.187
Nine years old.

33:03.439 --> 33:08.736
I watched as she contemplated
her mortality while standing on the roof.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.198
I could barely comprehend it.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.579
My father, my fucking…

33:20.081 --> 33:21.082
father…

33:24.335 --> 33:26.254
didn't move a muscle to help her.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.342
He just kept whispering in my ear…

33:32.885 --> 33:34.220
how weak she was.

33:36.639 --> 33:37.765
Over and over.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.978
And then… [laughs]

33:44.689 --> 33:45.815
when I cried…

33:47.942 --> 33:51.654
as I saw her step off that ledge… [laughs]

33:54.741 --> 33:57.952
he started telling me
how weak I was for shedding a tear.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.377
He's right.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.007
He's always been right.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.260
Like her…

34:17.764 --> 34:18.890
I am weak.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.144
Killing that animal…

34:28.107 --> 34:29.233
It was weakness.

34:38.034 --> 34:38.868
[sighs]

34:39.994 --> 34:41.162
You shouldn't be here.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.083
Any second they'll be coming for me.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.232
I'm not gonna let that happen.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.449
[somber music playing]

35:18.533 --> 35:19.742

35:27.917 --> 35:29.752

36:50.750 --> 36:52.084

-[man 3 screaming]
-[gunshots]

36:58.090 --> 36:59.383
[man 4] What the fuck?

37:01.093 --> 37:02.720
[man 5] Don't shoot me, please!

37:06.515 --> 37:08.184
[men screaming]

-[Spike grunts]

[girl shudders]

38:15.793 --> 38:17.044
You didn't see anything here.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.840
This never happened, do you understand me?

38:22.925 --> 38:24.051
Run.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.930
Run!

38:49.410 --> 38:50.411
[body thuds]

38:51.537 --> 38:53.539
[ominous music playing]

39:03.215 --> 39:04.675
[Spike] I can't keep doing this.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.010
This life.

39:06.802 --> 39:07.970
This madness.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.057
I don't want this to be who I am anymore.

39:15.811 --> 39:16.771
I'm leaving.

39:17.730 --> 39:18.856
Tonight.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.237
Run away with me.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.824
We, we can't.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.659
Yes, we can.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.328
-We can.
-No.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.163
We can go someplace
where we can just be us.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.332
He'll never stop looking for us.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.876
I'll make sure he never finds us.
I promise you.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.669
-Fearless--
-[Spike] Julia…

39:42.338 --> 39:43.339
I love you.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.219
I have since the moment I saw you.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.400
Yes. [sniffles]

40:03.359 --> 40:04.276
Yes.

40:10.866 --> 40:11.867
[sniffles]

40:15.204 --> 40:16.080
Midnight.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.459
Tonight. Under the bridge.

40:22.711 --> 40:23.838
I'll be there.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.513
I need your help.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.851
I need new papers, a new name.
New everything.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.602
You know you can't run.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.315
-Nobody can outrun The Syndicate.
-I need papers for Julia, too.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.275
No.

40:45.317 --> 40:49.071
No, no, no, no, no, don't do this!
Not with her.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.782
Her chances with me
are better than with Vicious.

40:51.866 --> 40:52.950
You know that.

40:55.828 --> 40:59.081
Promise me you will keep her safe.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.167
You have my word.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.211
I wish I could say I was happy for you,

41:04.837 --> 41:05.921
but I'm not.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.345
[Spike] Mmm.

41:14.221 --> 41:15.181
Beautiful.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.311
May I?

41:27.693 --> 41:29.028
Where did you get these?

41:29.695 --> 41:32.323
You think you're the only ones
that can fall in love?

41:36.619 --> 41:38.621
Gren'll make good on the papers.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.878
Thank you.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.062
[door opens]

42:04.355 --> 42:05.356
[door closes]

42:12.488 --> 42:13.447
[snoring]

42:23.332 --> 42:25.000
[Caliban] Quite the celebration
you've had.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.043
[groaning]

42:28.587 --> 42:29.588
[inhales]

42:34.426 --> 42:35.594
Father.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.139
I should've come to you. I apologize.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.266
Apologize?

42:40.933 --> 42:41.934
No.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.812
I've come to congratulate you.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.815
What you and Fearless did…

42:49.066 --> 42:50.276
Who thought it possible?

42:51.652 --> 42:54.488
Two men against an entire cartel.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.325
I may have underestimated you, boy.

43:00.452 --> 43:01.495
I'm proud of you.

43:04.456 --> 43:06.709
Well, they disrespected The Syndicate.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.420
They disrespected you,
I couldn't let that--

43:09.503 --> 43:10.462
-That's enough!
-[grunts]

43:13.549 --> 43:14.675
[Caliban] Worthless!

43:14.758 --> 43:18.178
And worse, you are a fucking liar!

43:18.262 --> 43:19.847
You're an embarrassment.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.433
-A meaningless slug!
-[Vicious groaning]

43:22.516 --> 43:25.811
Whose only achievements
come from the doings of others.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.859
Oh, how I dreamt that one day you would
prove yourself to be man enough.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.278
But alas.

43:36.238 --> 43:39.158
I should've ended you long ago.

43:39.867 --> 43:43.203
But here you still are by some miracle.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.999
-Fearless--
-Yes, Fearless.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.711
Fearless is a wild card in the deck.

43:51.378 --> 43:55.007
I'd anticipated his loyalty
to be singular to The Syndicate,

43:55.090 --> 43:56.842
but you believed it was to you!

43:57.593 --> 44:00.929
And the irony for both of us
was that he was only ever

44:01.639 --> 44:03.140
loyal to himself.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.727
While you were neck-deep in the bottle,

44:06.810 --> 44:10.147
your brother was stepping out
with your whore!

44:11.649 --> 44:13.442
-He wouldn't.
-He did.

44:14.526 --> 44:16.111
And papers were processed.

44:16.904 --> 44:20.491
They're not just running around on you,

44:20.574 --> 44:22.910
they're running away from you.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.203
[Caliban grunts]

44:24.286 --> 44:25.579
Where are they?

[exhales]

44:29.333 --> 44:30.250
[Caliban sighs]

44:34.630 --> 44:36.006
You want to be a capo?

44:37.675 --> 44:40.302
Capos don't ask questions.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.222
They find answers.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.069
[door closes]

45:01.782 --> 45:03.200
[grunting]

45:07.287 --> 45:08.622
Hello, Ana.

45:08.706 --> 45:09.623
What do you want?

45:10.791 --> 45:12.459
Where is Fearless taking her?

45:13.669 --> 45:14.795
I don't know what you're talk--

45:17.256 --> 45:19.925
How would you like
these next few moments to go?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.680
Piss off, cunt.

45:26.473 --> 45:27.391
[exhales]

45:29.893 --> 45:34.148
Everyone thinks they're so strong.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.153
Until they're not.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.742
-[grunts]
-[Ana screaming]

45:44.825 --> 45:48.620
[Vicious] Where is he?

46:12.644 --> 46:15.189
Vicious wants me
to bring you to his penthouse.

46:15.898 --> 46:16.774
What?

46:17.566 --> 46:19.777
-No, I-I'm--
-The streets are dangerous tonight

46:19.860 --> 46:21.195
and he wants to keep you safe.

46:21.278 --> 46:24.072
So, please just leave that here
and come with me.

[ominous music playing]

47:15.999 --> 47:17.292
Well, she's not coming.

47:19.837 --> 47:20.921
Not tonight.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.965
Not ever.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.636
She chose me.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.279
Think you're fast enough?
