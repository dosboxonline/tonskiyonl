[grunting]

00:16.516 --> 00:18.101
-[grunting]
-[young Sato] Again!

00:18.184 --> 00:19.102
[grunting]

00:20.145 --> 00:21.396
Again!

00:22.605 --> 00:23.606
[grunting]

00:24.274 --> 00:26.443
Army training is not enough!

00:27.152 --> 00:29.654
[grunting]

00:29.738 --> 00:33.116
Your head… must forget pain.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.868
[grunting]

00:34.951 --> 00:36.536
To succeed,

00:37.412 --> 00:39.539
you must overcome!

00:41.374 --> 00:43.293
[grunting]

00:43.376 --> 00:45.086
[young Sato] Train mind!

00:45.879 --> 00:48.465
-[grunting]
-Train body!

00:49.090 --> 00:53.678
[grunting]

00:54.304 --> 00:55.430
[in Japanese] Stop!

00:56.681 --> 00:58.767
-Show me your hands.
-[young Chozen] Uncle?

00:58.850 --> 01:01.227
[tense music plays]

01:02.312 --> 01:04.689
Is this a pillow to soften the blow?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.318
Only a coward would use such a thing!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.071
A man without honor

01:11.738 --> 01:13.198
is no man.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.077
Do you want to be a man, Chozen?

01:18.328 --> 01:20.080
Or do you want to be a coward?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.874
[tense music continues]

01:25.251 --> 01:27.378
-[young Sato] Continue!
-[grunting]

01:28.046 --> 01:29.297
[grunting]

01:29.380 --> 01:31.508
-[grunting]
-Again!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.176
-[young Sato] Again!
-[grunting]

01:34.010 --> 01:36.638
-[grunting]
-[young Sato] Again!

01:36.721 --> 01:41.810
[grunting]

01:43.103 --> 01:46.689
[in English] When I look around today,
I see the future.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.276
Now it's no secret
our past has been flawed.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.571
Sensei Kreese fell victim to his demons.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.200
But John Kreese is not Cobra Kai.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.410
We are.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
We've already shown we're champions.

02:03.164 --> 02:07.710
But that championship
is merely a springboard to new heights.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.589
That's why I've brought in
some of the finest senseis in the Valley.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.093
Consider this their job interview.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.805
Let's all give it up.
Champ is in the house.

02:18.888 --> 02:24.936
[applause and cheering]

02:26.104 --> 02:28.439
She's allowed to be a little late. Today.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.399
[laughter]

02:30.358 --> 02:32.610
-When you gonna bring your trophy in?
-Not today.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.404
[Silver] All right, warm up.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.824
The senseis will instruct you.
Let's see what they know.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.743
[man] All right. Let's go.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.913
-[man] Circle round.
-Hey.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.916
[tense music plays]

02:47.750 --> 02:50.170
So you are champion, eh?

02:50.753 --> 02:52.922
Yeah. I guess.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.882
Good.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.177
Then I will not go easy on you.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679
[tense music continues]

03:00.638 --> 03:01.639
[music fades]

03:02.640 --> 03:03.725
[Johnny] All right. Gracias.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.685
[woman speaks Spanish]

03:05.768 --> 03:07.896
[cheerful music plays]

03:07.979 --> 03:11.733
-All right. How we looking?
-I think I got it matched up to my phone.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.402
Only a few miles to go.
Looks like a lot of bars and restaurants.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.866
Here, let's ask this guy. Hola.

03:19.949 --> 03:20.992
[in Spanish] Speak Spanish?

03:21.075 --> 03:21.910
[in English] What?

03:21.993 --> 03:22.827
[In Spanish] Spanish?

03:22.911 --> 03:24.245
-[in English] No, America.
-Mexico.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.998
[in Spanish] You're in a tow zone.
I need you to move the van.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.334
[in English] Gracias. It's custom decal.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.336
[in Spanish] I want man.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.795
Hector the Salazar.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.965
I don't know a Hector Salazar.
You have to move the van, please.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.675
[in English] He wants money.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.302
[in Spanish] No, no money.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.762
Move the van.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.806
[in English] No, you cannot have the van.
It's very special.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.143
You tell me, donde Hector Salazar,
I give you dineros, sí?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.102
[in Spanish] Money?

03:48.186 --> 03:49.020
Sí.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.191
-[man speaks Spanish]
-[in English] All right. [laughs]

03:53.274 --> 03:55.401
Can you believe this guy? What?

03:56.527 --> 03:59.989
If Hector is so dangerous, I don't think
we should be throwing his name around.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.991
We gotta shake the tree to get the apples.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.788
-Or we could climb the tree ourselves.
-What does that mean? What tree?

04:06.871 --> 04:09.832
The apple tree.
You just said you wanted-- Wait!

04:09.916 --> 04:11.751
-[Johnny] Hey, hey! Hey!
-[Robby] Hey!

04:11.834 --> 04:13.836
[upbeat music plays]

04:14.671 --> 04:15.505
[music stops]

04:20.385 --> 04:21.636
Hey!

04:22.845 --> 04:24.055
There he is.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.517
-You must have been wiped out, right?
-Yeah, a little bit.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.977
What are you… What are you making?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.729
Ah, we're making my famous churrasco.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.731
Churrasco. Okay.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.818
Yeah. Get in there.
Let me see those quick reflexes.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.820
Tell me where you learned
to move like that.

04:38.903 --> 04:42.031
[Miguel] Okay. Uh, well,
I studied martial arts.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.826
Karate. I won a championship back home.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.704
A champion in California? Wow! [chuckles]

04:48.288 --> 04:49.914
I'm surprised I never heard of you.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.709
Well, actually, you… You might have.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.753
Uh, it's… It's kind of why I'm here.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.672
[Luis laughs]

04:57.755 --> 04:59.966
Oh, sorry, it can get hectic here.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.135
The little guy is a real handful.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.804
[chuckles] You ever think
of having any more or…

05:05.722 --> 05:07.223
Oh, no. No.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.435
He's not mine.
He's from her previous marriage.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.353
Never had any kids of my own.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.314
Oh.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.941
I was almost a family man once.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.944
Yeah. Even got married.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.738
[soft music plays]

05:21.821 --> 05:24.073
We started talking about having kids.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.036
But she left.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.538
[soft music continues]

05:31.664 --> 05:34.000
That's… That's too bad.

05:34.083 --> 05:34.917
Hmm.

05:36.044 --> 05:36.878
Hey!

05:38.212 --> 05:39.547
I got a great idea.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.383
I'm going to El Hoyo Verde later.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.512
You gotta come out with me.
You'll love it.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.805
Uh…

05:48.514 --> 05:52.685
Please, come on. You can't leave Mexico
without a few stories, right?

05:53.770 --> 05:54.604
Please.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.064
[in Spanish] You're gonna enjoy it.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.316
[in English] I owe you.
Let me show you a good time.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.525
[soft music fades]

06:03.237 --> 06:04.405
[Tory grunts quietly]

06:05.948 --> 06:09.702
-[scoffs] You are better than this.
-[Tory] How would you know?

06:09.786 --> 06:13.623
-You've never seen me fight.
-It is obvious. You are troubled.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.627
Maybe you do not want to train anymore
now that you are champion.

06:17.710 --> 06:21.547
I don't just fight for a trophy.
I wanna be strong, to defend what's mine.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.133
-Good reasons.
-What about you?

06:25.718 --> 06:26.594
Why be a sensei?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.430
Honor.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.435
-That's it?
-That is everything.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.855
I thought I had lost my honor.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.858
Eventually, I understood.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.612
No one can take honor from you.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.366
Only you can take honor from yourself.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.620
How's it going here, Sensei…

06:52.703 --> 06:53.913
Jokichi Tatsuya.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.249
Everyone calls me Joe.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.253
Sensei Joe. What are you working on
with our champion?

07:00.878 --> 07:03.840
First train mind. Then train body.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.093
Don't let me interrupt.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.348
[Chozen] If you want
to break free of troubles,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.809
you must face them directly.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.103
[soft music plays]

07:19.689 --> 07:21.274
[Chozen] Now, focus.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.234
Center.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.112
-Breathe.
-[Tory inhales]

07:27.780 --> 07:29.991
-[grunts] Attack! Yes!
-[Tory grunts]

07:31.492 --> 07:33.077
Nice work, Nichols.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.122
Now like this.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.044
[grunts fiercely]

07:44.881 --> 07:46.549
You know Tang Soo Do.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.633
Hmm.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.802
Where are you from exactly, Sensei Joe?

07:49.886 --> 07:50.761
Kyoto.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.263
Ah, beautiful.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.016
I've always loved
the Fushimi Inari Shrine.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.476
[Chozen] Too many tourists.

07:56.559 --> 08:00.688
Nanzen-ji Temple,
much better for your next visit.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.524
Hmm?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.652
[tense music plays]

08:10.656 --> 08:11.741
[tense music fades]

08:11.824 --> 08:14.619
Guy at the impound lot
said we need 4,000 pesos.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.287
That's, like, a million dollars.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.499
It's $200. But still,
we only have about half that.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.251
We're not gonna find Miguel
without the van.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.545
[man 1 in Spanish] Place your bets!

08:24.629 --> 08:26.464
[loud indistinct chatter]

08:28.633 --> 08:31.719
[in English] That's a Red Savina. That
thing'll burn a hole right through you.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.181
Mom and I watch Hot Ones on YouTube.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.641
-[man 2 retches]
-[laughter]

08:36.724 --> 08:39.685
[loud indistinct chatter]

08:39.769 --> 08:41.646
This is our shot to get back on track.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.941
If you see me about to choke,
cover my mouth so I don't spit it out.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.609
Wait.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.528
I'll do it.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.279
No. Robby, I got us into this.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.322
Like you said,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.491
this is our best shot.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.368
I know I can win.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.120
[tense music plays]

09:19.976 --> 09:21.269
That's my boy!

09:22.937 --> 09:25.022
[in Spanish] Look at the gringo
sweating like a pig.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.400
He'll be dead before the second round.

09:30.778 --> 09:31.612
One more.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.324
[in English] The hottest pepper.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.993
[tense music continues]

09:38.452 --> 09:39.453
El dragón!

09:40.413 --> 09:43.040
[tense music crescendos]

09:54.051 --> 09:56.596
-Miggy. Oh my God. Are you okay?
-[Miguel] You lied to me.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.055
He doesn't even know I exist.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.058
Mijo, I had to.
You don't understand how dangerous he is.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.894
He's nothing like you said.
Y-You were wrong about him.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.732
He's smart, he's generous. He's respected.
He… He has his own business.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.443
All of these things
I missed out on because of you.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.278
[tense music plays]

10:12.945 --> 10:15.531
Miggy, no. Please listen to me.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.283
-[Hector] Vamonos, Miguel.
-I…

10:17.366 --> 10:19.160
-[Hector] El Hoyo Verde is calling.
-Don't--

10:20.286 --> 10:21.621
[Hector] Come on, let's go.

10:22.121 --> 10:22.955
Hey.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.832
[sighs]

10:24.915 --> 10:26.917
[tense music plays]

10:29.795 --> 10:31.797
[crowd chatters and shouts]

10:36.552 --> 10:38.471
[tense music continues]

10:41.349 --> 10:43.684
We're going all in. Todo.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.730
[man 1 in Spanish] Place your bets!

10:49.357 --> 10:51.942
[in English] You got this.
I'd bet on you any day of the week.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.028
[tense music continues]

11:07.375 --> 11:09.251
[dramatic music plays]

11:22.181 --> 11:23.974
[cheering]

11:28.270 --> 11:30.272
[dramatic music continues]

11:45.329 --> 11:46.831
Yes!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.168
[pepper-eating man coughs]

11:52.336 --> 11:55.506
Sensei Joe. What are you doing tonight?

11:55.589 --> 11:59.009
I'd love to hear more how
a Japanese master ended up in the Valley.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.429
I am happy to tell you story.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.140
Great. Dinner and drinks at my house.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.643
Amber, will you make sure
Sensei Joe gets all my info?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.645
I'll see you tonight.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.398
[pensive music plays]

12:19.697 --> 12:23.159
-I need to talk to you.
-Nichols, what's on your mind?

12:23.868 --> 12:26.120
Excited to take things to the next level?

12:26.203 --> 12:29.415
What's the point? You'll just pay
to make me champion again.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.500
[quiet tense music plays]

12:32.084 --> 12:33.419
So you know about the ref.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.716
Told anyone else?

12:39.508 --> 12:40.342
Not yet.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.971
-So you don't deny it?
-Not at all.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.641
I paid him off to make sure Cobra Kai won.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.437
It was an insurance policy.
You still won the fight.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.272
-Did I?
-[Silver] Of course you did.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.025
You're the champion. I know it.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.569
LaRusso knows it.
The whole Valley knows it.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.573
If you don't believe it,
you're the only person who doesn't.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.700
What am I supposed to do?
Just go back to normal?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.076
Act like nothing happened?

13:06.869 --> 13:07.703
Listen.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.999
I'm not Sensei Kreese.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.920
I don't have the connection you two had.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.673
I never had to scrape and claw
my whole life, like you.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.008
But what I do know

13:22.092 --> 13:25.179
is how to use every advantage
to ensure victory.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.556
You mean cheating.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.476
The tournament was a matter
of Cobra Kai's survival.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.854
If a person steals food to survive,
are they cheating?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.066
Or are they doing what must be done?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.109
I want you to be here.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.946
And I want you to be you.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.117
If you choose to leave,
I won't hold it against you.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.120
But if you come back tomorrow,

13:50.204 --> 13:52.414
I will make you the future of this dojo.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.503
The decision is yours.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.588
[pensive music plays]

14:05.010 --> 14:07.012
[pensive music fades]

14:10.975 --> 14:12.977
[upbeat pop music plays]

14:15.604 --> 14:19.066
-[Johnny] You sure you're all right?
-[clears throat] Ugh.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.109
Never better.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.197
I still don't know
how you managed to eat that last chili.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.867
I didn't.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.580
[suspenseful music plays]

14:32.663 --> 14:33.873
What were you chewing on?

14:36.458 --> 14:39.169
[both laugh]

14:39.253 --> 14:41.088
That's gonna make for a hell of a story.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.632
That's about the most badass thing
I've ever seen.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.093
[phone rings]

14:47.761 --> 14:49.847
-Carmen?
-[Carmen] Miguel is with his dad.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.684
He doesn't understand he's in danger.
He doesn't know the kind of man Hector is.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.185
-He say anything?
-[Carmen] Nothing.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.230
I think I heard Hector say
they were going someplace. El Hoyo Verde.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.024
They're going to El Hoyo Verde.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.570
Back the way we came.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.405
We're on our way.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.283
[man] Hey, Hector.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.076
[Hector] Hey, brother.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.245
-[in Spanish] Can we skip the line?
-Of course, Hector!

15:14.038 --> 15:15.581
Ah, welcome.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.458
[crowd cheering]

15:17.541 --> 15:19.543
[upbeat music plays]

15:24.506 --> 15:26.050
[in English] Hey. This way.

15:28.844 --> 15:29.678
This is awesome!

15:29.762 --> 15:32.306
[chuckles] I knew you'd love it.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.141
Hey.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.601
[in Spanish] Fortaleza. Two.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.355
Vicente.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.940
[Vicente] Hector!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.149
How you doing, man?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.985
[in Spanish] Let me introduce
my friend here. We just met.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.613
He helped me
avoid an accident the other day.

15:47.696 --> 15:51.116
[in English] This is Vicente.
He's the headline fight tonight. Huh?

15:51.700 --> 15:52.576
Nice to meet you.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.579
-[in Spanish] All right.
-My buddy is a martial arts champion.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.499
And he can take your job away like that.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.168
[Vicente] Hmm. All right, I gotta warm up.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.837
[in English] Second round. Max.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.632
You're kind of like the mayor, huh?

16:07.299 --> 16:10.469
Well, I made a lot of money
back in the day,

16:11.178 --> 16:13.389
but not in the restaurant business.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.060
The kind of business where
you make a lot of friends in high places.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.229
Enemies too.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.897
[crowd cheers]

16:23.065 --> 16:23.941
[fighter grunts]

16:25.693 --> 16:26.819
But I put the past away.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.614
Ah, tequila.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.575
So, uh,

16:34.410 --> 16:35.577
putting the past away.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.038
Salud.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.124
[upbeat music continues]

16:40.666 --> 16:41.625
[fighters grunt]

16:42.251 --> 16:44.003
[announcer] Impresionante!

16:45.462 --> 16:47.631
This is better
than we could have hoped for.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.425
You connected with him.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.469
Now we can dig deeper,
figure out what his plan is,

16:52.553 --> 16:55.055
and if he gives us anything,
we can pounce on it.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.557
Too small.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.434
Yeah. You know what?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.478
I think I have a gray one
in my other closet that's a size up.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
Just let me, uh…

17:02.646 --> 17:04.732
[sighs] You are nervous, Daniel-san.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.859
[quiet tense music plays]

17:06.942 --> 17:09.528
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.782
Remember, everything Silver does
has a purpose.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.826
He is a man without honor.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.163
My uncle tried to teach me about honor.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.540
But I was not ready to learn.

17:22.541 --> 17:26.086
I thought shortcuts, cheating,
would get me through faster.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.921
Make my life easier.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.676
My cowardice was exposed for all to see.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.473
We will find his weakness.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.059
We'll push him to his limit.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.103
He will reveal his true colors.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.189
For all to see.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.815
[tense operatic music plays]

17:46.899 --> 17:50.235
[Daniel] You'll have to play his game.
But don't let your guard down.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.989
If he sees a weakness,
you may not even know until it's too late.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.826
He'll do things to make you feel special.

17:59.119 --> 18:02.664
He got me on his side once.
He'll try to do the same thing with you.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.626
This plan has an expiration date.
Silver's too smart.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.710
Please.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.755
[Daniel] Eventually, he'll figure us out.
And when he does,

18:11.381 --> 18:12.549
be ready to fight.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.427
Yamazaki,

18:16.011 --> 18:17.012
50-year-old.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.682
I promise that'll be
the best whiskey you ever have.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.694
You are correct.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.739
A taste of home. Filleted hamo.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.910
-How long you been in the Valley?
-[Chozen] One year.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.705
I was planning to retire
when I saw your advertisement.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.082
Why do you want the job?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.251
You assume I want the job.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.629
I am not yet sure.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.257
The other applicants
would kill to work for me.

18:53.340 --> 18:56.260
But you said there were issues
with your former partner.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.848
We've had our bumps in the road, sure.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.725
Dealt with some disloyalty.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.978
But we're back on track now.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.813
[Chozen] Your success
does not surprise me.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.399
Your students are well-trained.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.609
Especially your champion.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.363
Well, our students are our legacy.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.158
And whose legacy do you carry?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.285
My master was Kim Sun-Yung.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.036
Among others.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.455
And you? Your father?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.332
I was raised by my uncle.

19:28.041 --> 19:28.917
My father

19:30.294 --> 19:31.795
died when I was young.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.547
Hmm. What killed him?

19:34.673 --> 19:35.507
Cowardice.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.802
I struggled with my own cowardice.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.345
I lost a fight.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.016
A fight I should have won.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.852
Rivalries die slow deaths,

19:47.519 --> 19:48.812
especially in Japan.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.859
I can relate.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.488
I have a rival
in this dojo business, in fact.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.740
This guy, LaRusso.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.076
But it's never too late

20:03.702 --> 20:05.412
to get the last laugh, right?

20:05.495 --> 20:06.330
Mmm.

20:08.957 --> 20:09.958
Grab your drink.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.002
I wanna show you something.

20:21.178 --> 20:25.182
Look at this MMA grab-ass bullshit.
Hector the Salazar, you know him?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.475
[man replies in Spanish]

20:28.435 --> 20:30.187
[in Spanish] I need man.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.563
Hector the Salazar.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.940
[man grunts]

20:40.322 --> 20:42.616
[crowd cheers]

20:46.495 --> 20:47.496
What's up?

20:47.579 --> 20:50.207
[man] Hector, there are some gringos here
asking about you.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.124
Gringos?

20:51.917 --> 20:55.295
-What gringos? Who'd they come with?
-I think they're with the FBI.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.756
Son of a bitch.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.424
[man] Get downstairs.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.135
Listen. They don't have jurisdiction here.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.221
So keep them busy.

21:08.558 --> 21:09.685
[in English] Everything okay?

21:15.315 --> 21:17.651
Who were you on the phone with earlier?

21:19.736 --> 21:20.862
Uh…

21:21.697 --> 21:24.283
-Just my mom. Checking up on her.
-Right, right, right.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.453
So you came to Mexico all alone?

21:29.997 --> 21:30.914
Yeah.

21:30.998 --> 21:34.126
-I was, uh, backpacking like I said.
-I know what you said.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.171
-Were you following me?
-What? No.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.340
-Are you with the feds?
-No. Absolutely not.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.968
-What… Hey, watch--
-Hey!

21:43.051 --> 21:45.053
[tense music plays]

21:48.140 --> 21:50.350
-Give me your phone.
-I got nothing on my phone.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.186
-I mean, I'm a nice--
-Don't make me ask again.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.980
[tense music continues]

22:22.341 --> 22:26.511
[crowd cheers]

22:27.220 --> 22:28.388
[tense music fades]

22:28.472 --> 22:29.348
[sighs]

22:30.098 --> 22:32.184
Sorry about that, kid. Sorry.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.397
People are not always what they seem, hmm?

22:38.774 --> 22:39.941
You can never be too sure.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.612
[dramatic music plays]

22:45.947 --> 22:49.743
-[crowd cheers and yells]
-[dramatic music continues]

22:52.496 --> 22:55.540
Hey, let's get out of here. Come on.

22:56.917 --> 23:01.088
-[announcer in Spanish] …headline fight!
-The assholes are here. There are two.

23:01.171 --> 23:05.592
Vicente "The Wolf" Gonzales!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.511
[Johnny] Miguel!

23:07.594 --> 23:09.638
[announcer] You won't wanna miss this!

23:09.721 --> 23:10.972
Look! Over there!

23:11.056 --> 23:12.933
Show those feds how we fight.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.227
[in English] Move.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.020
[in Spanish] You're not
getting near Hector.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.271
[announcer] One minute.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.233
Looks like the Wolf is having
trouble getting in the ring.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.692
-[Johnny grunts]
-[Vicente groans]

23:22.776 --> 23:24.569
[dramatic music plays]

23:25.612 --> 23:27.989
[announcer] The Wolf grabs a hold
of this crazy white man!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.408
[dramatic music continues]

23:29.491 --> 23:31.451
[Vicente grunts]

23:31.535 --> 23:33.453
But he escapes! [laughs]

23:33.537 --> 23:35.997
[in English] No, Robby.
I got this. Just stay there.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.374
[dramatic music continues]

23:37.958 --> 23:39.960
[announcer in Spanish]
Crazy guy's on the offensive!

23:40.544 --> 23:41.670
[grunting]

23:41.753 --> 23:43.505
[announcer] He's doing karate!

23:44.131 --> 23:46.258
It's karate versus MMA!

23:46.341 --> 23:49.094
He kicks as fast as lightning!

23:49.177 --> 23:50.887
[grunting]

23:51.596 --> 23:52.764
Oh my God!

23:53.432 --> 23:56.309
It looks like MMA is kicking karate's ass!

23:56.393 --> 23:59.146
[grunting]

23:59.229 --> 24:00.730
[dramatic music continues]

24:07.154 --> 24:10.407
[announcer] Things don't look good
for White Lightning!

24:11.491 --> 24:12.868
[in English] Dad!

24:14.661 --> 24:15.537
Catch!

24:17.372 --> 24:18.915
[Vicente groans]

24:19.958 --> 24:21.585
[Vicente yells]

24:21.668 --> 24:22.752
[in Spanish] My eyes!

24:22.836 --> 24:23.670
[Vicente groans]

24:24.463 --> 24:25.338
[Vicente groans]

24:25.922 --> 24:27.340
Spectacular!

24:28.425 --> 24:29.843
What a fight!

24:29.926 --> 24:32.053
[crowd chant in Spanish]

24:32.137 --> 24:33.430
Where's Hector?

24:35.390 --> 24:36.600
[Silver] Check this out.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.936
Some of the finest swords in the world.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.106
I figured you'd appreciate them.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.566
Very much.

24:46.985 --> 24:47.861
This one?

24:55.827 --> 24:59.206
This was wielded by Uesugi Kenshin himself

24:59.789 --> 25:02.083
at the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.921
It's called Meiyo aru kyodai.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.756
"Honored brother."

25:09.299 --> 25:11.134
[Silver] That's what the auction house
told me.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.387
Might all be bullshit, right? [laughs]

25:14.971 --> 25:15.805
But, hey,

25:15.889 --> 25:20.018
there are few things more valuable
than a great story. Don't you think?

25:20.101 --> 25:21.645
A story is only words.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.272
Belief in story much more valuable.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.194
You're still not sold on Cobra Kai then?

25:29.903 --> 25:32.822
[Chozen] I am not here
because you want me to teach karate.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.075
You aspire to something far greater.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.036
What is your true ambition?

25:41.998 --> 25:43.542
I never had any children.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.962
My only legacy is Cobra Kai.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.007
We're already
the number one dojo in the Valley, but

25:52.133 --> 25:54.970
I'm thinking a lot bigger
than just the Valley.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.930
The lessons we teach

25:57.597 --> 26:01.434
are the tools
that kids all over the world need

26:01.518 --> 26:04.271
to become stronger, better.

26:05.689 --> 26:10.026
I have a plan that will make Cobra Kai
and karate as synonymous as…

26:11.194 --> 26:12.737
Starbucks and coffee.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.115
And what is this plan?

26:16.866 --> 26:20.537
That's something I might feel comfortable
confiding in my right-hand man.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.958
If you're willing to take the job.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.045
Yosh.

26:32.966 --> 26:33.800
A toast, then.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.427
To…

26:37.512 --> 26:39.347
righting the wrongs of the past

26:40.098 --> 26:41.516
and coming back on top.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.268
Karii!

26:44.853 --> 26:45.729
Karii.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.814
[ominous music plays]

26:50.317 --> 26:51.526
[ominous music fades]

27:11.796 --> 27:14.883
You know, we should probably get you home.
I could drive you--

27:14.966 --> 27:18.345
No, no, no. We gotta lay low a few days.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.555
Maybe a week or two.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.101
What about Maria and Luis?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.603
Ah, they'll be fine.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.898
She's only after my money
in the first place.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.235
Why would you say that?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.367
You know about Icarus, kid?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.745
My dad used to tell me
all the greatest stories.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.164
That was his favorite.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.459
"Fly too close to the sun, chiquito,

27:50.502 --> 27:52.462
you'll burn your wings right off."

27:55.382 --> 27:59.636
What you don't learn till you get older
is that the sun is the government,

27:59.719 --> 28:01.012
it's women.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.808
You fly too high, they come and… [hisses]

28:06.267 --> 28:07.185
…bring you down.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.318
People will always
come after what's yours.

28:17.737 --> 28:21.282
[sighs] They want you to sleep
with one eye open.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.994
I can't even go
back to my home in Ecuador.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.788
Can you imagine?

28:28.081 --> 28:29.582
What happened in Ecuador?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.668
[quiet tense music plays]

28:33.461 --> 28:34.295
Success.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.716
Success happened.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.844
That woman I told you about?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.263
I was practically your age
when we got married.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.181
Hey, hey.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.684
Don't ever make that mistake.

28:48.727 --> 28:52.480
She couldn't stand me doing my business.
And her mother? Even worse.

28:53.481 --> 28:56.359
[in Spanish] They tried to fuck with me,
a successful man!

28:56.985 --> 29:00.822
The corrupt sons of bitches in Ecuador,
they did the same!

29:00.905 --> 29:02.907
[quiet tense music continues]

29:05.994 --> 29:07.537
[in English] And you know what I regret?

29:10.999 --> 29:12.041
Nothing.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.127
[tense music continues]

29:16.671 --> 29:19.340
-Nothing?
-That is the cost of doing business.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.217
That is the cost.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.766
[exhales] Sorry.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.812
I got myself all worked up.
I know what we need.

29:34.355 --> 29:35.440
You want chicharron?

29:37.358 --> 29:38.193
No.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.569
Um…

29:41.112 --> 29:42.113
I'm not hungry.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.243
I should probably get going actually.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.914
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.294
All right.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.213
Chicharron for one.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.342
[melancholy music plays]

30:03.802 --> 30:06.137
[Hector in Spanish]
Take care of yourself, kid.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.809
[melancholy music continues]

30:26.032 --> 30:27.492

30:28.576 --> 30:29.410

30:30.954 --> 30:31.955
Hey, Ma.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.040
[melancholy music continues]

30:36.793 --> 30:39.212
[Miguel cries] I'm sorry.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.091
You were right.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.051
Please, tell me you're okay, Miggy.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.345
[Miguel cries] I don't know, but…

30:48.471 --> 30:49.305
[Johnny] Miguel!

30:53.101 --> 30:55.103
[hopeful music plays]

30:55.812 --> 30:56.646

Miggy?

31:02.819 --> 31:03.736
[sighs]

31:04.863 --> 31:05.905
I'm okay, Ma.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.409
I'm coming home.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.494

31:23.214 --> 31:26.467

31:29.971 --> 31:31.055
[Johnny] All right.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.768
[melancholy music plays]

31:40.273 --> 31:43.026
All right. All right. Hey.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.073
[melancholy music fades]

31:49.157 --> 31:51.576
Nichols. So you've made your decision.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.330
I'm back.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.751
-Where's everyone else?
-No class today.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.630
There's some business
I need to take care of.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.477
Am I early?

32:18.603 --> 32:21.230
On the contrary. Right on time.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.149
Fall in!

32:35.620 --> 32:38.957
It seems you weren't entirely honest
with me, were you,

32:39.457 --> 32:40.833
Chozen?

32:40.917 --> 32:42.543
[ominous music plays]

32:42.627 --> 32:43.753
How did you know?

32:45.880 --> 32:49.676
Have you ever heard of a man,
Masataka Taketsuru?

32:51.177 --> 32:55.556
About a hundred years ago,
he moved from Hiroshima to Scotland.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.017
He studied organic chemistry.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.687
Then he returned to Japan

33:00.770 --> 33:03.314
with the secret of great whiskey.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.151
He built up his own distillery
just outside of Kyoto.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.569
His brand, Suntory,

33:09.570 --> 33:10.905
the whiskey we drank last night,

33:12.323 --> 33:13.992
considered the best in the world.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.578
I've had the pleasure of drinking it
right where it's made.

33:18.079 --> 33:22.500
And every time I raise a glass
with one of my old friends from Kyoto,

33:22.583 --> 33:24.335
we toast kanpai.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.006
So imagine my surprise…

33:30.008 --> 33:32.343
when my new friend from Kyoto

33:33.094 --> 33:34.595
raises a glass,

33:35.179 --> 33:37.974
and says something they would only say

33:38.599 --> 33:39.600
in Okinawa.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.646
Karii.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.815
Karii.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.362
Anyone who takes this man down

33:52.447 --> 33:53.448
gets the job,

33:54.198 --> 33:56.034
and I will pay triple

33:56.576 --> 33:57.660
what I promised!
