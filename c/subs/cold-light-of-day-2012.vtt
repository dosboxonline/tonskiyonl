are trying to eliminate witnesses,

CARRACK: All right! That's it!

01:20:14.635 --> 01:20:17.678
I'm getting sick of this. Come on.

01:20:18.722 --> 01:20:20.556
LUCIA: She's coming! She's coming!

01:20:21.558 --> 01:20:22.683
Come on!

[GUNSHOTS]

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:26.938
God damn!

01:21:05.352 --> 01:21:06.936
Carrack, you bitch!

Oh, Will. [SIGHS]

[CLICKING TONGUE]

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.399
What a mess.

01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:40.029
Looks like you're gonna need
some more stitches.

01:22:40.864 --> 01:22:43.240
And your little dead friend, too.

01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:46.035
Your mother's gonna freak out.

01:22:47.204 --> 01:22:50.665
Aw! Is that your father's gun? [CHUCKLING]

01:22:52.876 --> 01:22:54.251
I'm sorry.

01:22:58.465 --> 01:23:00.174
You looking for something like this?

[SIREN APPROACHING]

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:01.026
My sister. She's hurt back there.

01:24:01.319 --> 01:24:04.280
Relax. She's halfway to the hospital.

01:24:09.536 --> 01:24:12.747
Your father, for all the hell he caused us,

01:24:14.958 --> 01:24:16.876
would be proud of you.

01:24:20.464 --> 01:24:22.339
What about my family?

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:41.942
Oh, my God!

01:24:42.402 --> 01:24:44.153
[INDISTINCT]

01:25:17.187 --> 01:25:20.314
You handled yourself pretty well out there
for a kid who knows shit.

01:25:20.565 --> 01:25:22.441
I have to tell you, I was impressed.

01:25:24.778 --> 01:25:27.738
Thanks for helping us
clean up our own mess.

01:25:29.115 --> 01:25:30.616
Does this mean I can go home now?

01:25:30.742 --> 01:25:32.201
Sure. Whatever.

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:34.870
But I think you should really consider
another line of work.

01:25:36.456 --> 01:25:40.042
You know, your father was an honest man.

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.628
I'm sorry he's gone.

01:25:44.464 --> 01:25:45.840
Thank you.

01:25:46.591 --> 01:25:48.551
Could I ask you something?

01:25:49.219 --> 01:25:50.427
Shoot.

01:25:51.638 --> 01:25:53.639
What the hell was in the briefcase?

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:55.474
There's only one way I can answer that.

01:26:01.648 --> 01:26:03.649
I've gotta go see my family.

01:26:13.994 --> 01:26:14.952
Hey.

01:26:16.246 --> 01:26:17.580
Thank you.

01:26:25.672 --> 01:26:27.840
You told her about me, right?

01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:32.261
It didn't really seem important.

01:26:33.179 --> 01:26:34.972
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:43.480
You should go and introduce yourself.

01:26:43.523 --> 01:26:45.274
She is your sister.

01:26:46.902 --> 01:26:48.527
