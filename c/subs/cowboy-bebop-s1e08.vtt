[Godard] Please, you don't understand.
He's an experiment gone wrong.

[Godard crying] You can't let him out.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.547
He says we can. So we will.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.966
[Godard] This isn't someone
you put in the world.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.094
We hooked him on Red-Eye to control him.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.681
It's why we invented the stuff,
but it scrambled his brain.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.560
That, and the time
he spent fighting on Titan.

01:00.643 --> 01:05.398
He's a violent, homicidal loose cannon.

01:06.357 --> 01:10.904

When it's your turn.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.879
But you already hit the things.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.881
Pretty sure you get two throws per turn.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.053
Why are we here?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.305
Because it's family time.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.099
And during family time
we do fun things together.

I can really see
how this helps you find your inner Zen.

someone sent him after us?

I mean, I've pissed off
plenty of scumbags in my time,

10:52.693 --> 10:53.819

11:27.186 --> 11:28.020
Might?

in your mouth instead.

he was way less banged up than you
and he got one of these chem treatments,

Where are you going?

12:10.938 --> 12:13.941
To talk to someone,
to help me figure out who this maniac is.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.694
Let him sit
in the solution for 15 minutes,

12:16.777 --> 12:18.654

we'd be meeting some place more, um…

Candlelit.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.605
[chuckles]

12:53.230 --> 12:55.441
But after doing the digging you asked,

12:56.275 --> 12:58.110
can't say it got my whistle wet.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.280
Must be bad. You usually
get a kick out of this kind of stuff.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.742
No. This is dry-mouth, cold-sweats bad.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.292
-Are you joking?
-Making a point.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.880
Your boy here is a phantom.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.092
Scrubbed cleaner
than my bikini line in the summertime.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.096
No sign of him ever existing.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.015
Anywhere.

13:28.682 --> 13:34.522
Now, who has that kind of access
or money for this level of invisibility?

13:34.605 --> 13:38.025
Special forces, black-bag outfits,

13:39.109 --> 13:40.027
Syndicate.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.739
Since when did you
have that kind of heat on you?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.698
Never.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.868
Yeah, well, I had a feeling
you're into clean living,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.870
even in your dirty business.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.456
But what about your partner?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.124
What about him?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.418
You ever run a search on the guy?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.881
I mean, saving my life
was his job interview.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.175
You know,
he pulls my bacon out of the fire,

14:03.259 --> 14:04.844
I don't question his integrity.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.847
Yeah, well, I took the liberty.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.017
And your partner, Spike Spiegel,

14:13.143 --> 14:15.896
he's even less conspicuous
than the Phantom.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.110
You've got issues.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.530
I got all sorts of 'em,
but not my partner.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.157
Yeah. Okay.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.286
[sighs]

14:34.039 --> 14:34.999
Thanks, Woody.

14:36.083 --> 14:36.917
I owe you.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.214
The greater the tab,
the greater the payback.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.426
So protect that ass of yours, Jet.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.095
I'm going to want what's mine.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.764
[Jet] See you, Woody.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.923
How you doing?

15:24.882 --> 15:25.758
I'm all right.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.637
Those blue balls are worse than the fire.

[both chuckle]

15:31.513 --> 15:32.514
Oh, man…

15:32.598 --> 15:34.767
Good thing I brought
something for the pain.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.143
-Is that…
-Yes, it is.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.562
From the secret-secret stash.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.439
Monkey Punchy Jamaican rum.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.775
Distilled on Old Earth, before The Fall.

15:45.527 --> 15:49.406
I thought all you had
on this ship was whisky.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.868
This is for medicinal purposes only.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.161
[Spike chuckling] Right.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.457
-[Jet clicks tongue]
-[Spike] Mm.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.213
Easy, Ace. It's a sipping rum.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.006
[sighs]

16:06.090 --> 16:06.966
I was sipping.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.509
Uh-huh.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.428
What are we toasting?
Getting our asses whooped?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.472
I'm toasting you being alive

16:13.555 --> 16:16.475
after throwing yourself
at that maniac when he came at you. Ha.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.439
What did he say to you?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.485
-[Spike] Who?
-[Jet] The maniac.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.404
I saw him talking to you.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
-Now I'm friends with him?
-You're my friend.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.575
No need to keep secrets.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.121

of the Monkey Punchy, pal.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.041

16:41.125 --> 16:42.209

16:48.716 --> 16:49.591
Oh.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.417
I need to figure out
who that hit man was in the alley.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.294
-Hmm.
-What are you doing?

18:07.377 --> 18:09.505
Making a list
of everyone I've ever pissed off.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.757
[Jet] Come on, Spike.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.593
The guy said something to you.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.430
-Who is he?
-That's what I'm trying to find out.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.250
you're going to come up empty.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.501
[Spike] And what makes you so sure?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.503
[Jet] Because I've already researched him.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.214
[Spike] Yeah? You did research
into why this guy hates dogs?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.007
[Jet] Enough with
the bullshitting already.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.717
You can tell me if you know this guy.

I will kill your friends.

you're going to go at him alone?

from explosives and fast-moving bursts.

I kind of like the dog.
It's fuzzy, cute, but…

It shoots video from its eyes.

through this a dozen times,

a nearly unstoppable assassin here--

25:53.718 --> 25:56.054
-We don't know if he's unstoppable.
-We know.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.641
There's one of him and three of us.
That gives us a tactical advantage.

26:03.853 --> 26:07.065

Spike takes the ship from the bay.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.788
flies it down to the park,
walks the rest of the way.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.291
Then Spike does like the killer says

26:24.374 --> 26:27.210
and faces him down
like a man with no dread.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.546
Which leads to Phase Two.

in her Red Tail thriller,

in a dazzling first strike.

-Paving the way for Phase Three.
-What's with all the rhyming?

26:45.520 --> 26:48.523
It helps to retain the plan.
I saw it in an old Lee Marvin picture.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.526
Paving the way for Phase Three.

26:52.193 --> 26:56.072

the Bebop into the atmosphere,

26:56.156 --> 26:59.242
and fires a grapnel
like a man with no fear,

26:59.326 --> 27:02.037
puts the bad man into the sinkhole,

27:02.120 --> 27:06.207
and puts in some gas
to finish our big goal.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.546
I feel like we need
more phases to get the meter going.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.882
I like the meter just fine, smart guy.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.761
I didn't come up with this plan to fail.
Or to lose either one of you.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.765
I want to hear it again, with feeling.

Can I say something?

32:57.058 --> 32:58.101
Yeah.

Poisonous gas feels a little intense.

So you're a pacifist now?

What else am I supposed
to do with a canister of poison gas, hmm?

34:31.319 --> 34:34.238
[Faye] Did what I think just happened,
really happen?

34:34.322 --> 34:36.741
[Jet] If you think that every one
of our ship's systems

34:36.824 --> 34:40.411
got knocked out by a multipartite
fractal cascade virus. Yes.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.997
-[groans softly]
-[Faye] We got rid of the dog!

34:43.081 --> 34:45.208
How did the assassin
break into our system?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.961
[sighs]

34:49.045 --> 34:50.671
It wasn't the assassin.

34:58.721 --> 34:59.931
Spike did it?

35:01.182 --> 35:03.976
-He really didn't want us to go, did he?
-No, he didn't.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.022
He fried the fusion module
and lame-ducked us.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.567
Son of a bitch! It's going to take
at least an hour to replace.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.577
[Vicious] Did you truly believe

35:22.870 --> 35:24.872
I would trust you with my life?

35:31.379 --> 35:33.339
[breathing heavily]

35:33.923 --> 35:35.675
That I didn't have a plan?

35:39.387 --> 35:41.097
Tell Julia I'm sorry.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.267
For making her sing?

35:44.851 --> 35:45.893
For failing…

35:48.396 --> 35:49.939
to deliver your head

35:51.649 --> 35:52.692
to her.

It hurts, Mommy.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.597
It hurts, Mommy!

39:56.477 --> 39:58.145
It hurts, Mommy.
