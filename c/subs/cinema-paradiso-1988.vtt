WEBVTT

02:06.752 --> 02:10.339
Yes, Salvatore di Vita.

02:14.385 --> 02:17.847
You mean you don't know him, Miss?

02:17.972 --> 02:21.600
That's right, and I'm his mother.

02:21.725 --> 02:26.856
I've been calling from Sicily,
all day long.

02:29.275 --> 02:32.319
I see … he's not there.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.700
Could you please give me
his number?

02:40.244 --> 02:44.665
656 22 056.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.876
Thank you. Goodbye.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.757
It's useless to call.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.760
He's busy.
God knows where he is.

02:56.886 --> 02:59.138
He won't even remember.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.766
Forget it.

03:02.892 --> 03:05.895
He hasn't been here for 30 years.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.273
You know what he's like.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.486
He'll remember.

03:14.612 --> 03:18.407
I'm sure he will.
I know him better than you do.

03:18.532 --> 03:22.745
If he finds out we didn't tell him,
he'll be angry.

03:24.246 --> 03:30.044
I'd like to talk to Signor Salvatore di Vita.
I'm his mother.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.666
What the fuck are you looking at?

04:58.757 --> 05:02.928
Salvatore … what time is it?

05:04.930 --> 05:06.974
It's late.

05:09.685 --> 05:14.440
Sorry, I couldn't phone
to say I'd be late.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.944
Go back to sleep.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.366
Your mother phoned.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.995
She thought I was someone else.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.248
What did you tell her?

05:31.373 --> 05:36.503
Nothing, I didn't want to disappoint her.
We had a long chat.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.300
She said you've not visited her
for 30 years.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.927
She must come to see you.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.056
She called just to say that?

05:51.685 --> 05:57.816
No, she said someone's died.
Someone called Alfredo.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.903
The funeral is tomorrow.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.907
Who is he? A relative?

06:07.076 --> 06:10.871
No … go back to sleep.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.614
How can I say Mass with this boy?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.422
Toto!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.644
Thank God for that!

07:58.312 --> 07:59.688
How do I have to tell you?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.524
Without the bell,
I don't know where I am.

08:02.649 --> 08:07.029
Always asleep!
What do you do at night? Eat?

08:07.154 --> 08:11.408
Father Adelfio, at home
we don't even eat at lunchtime.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.037
The vet says that's why I'm tired.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.749
I'll tell you why you're tired.
Think I don't know?

08:18.874 --> 08:22.169
Run along now,
I've something to do.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.379
- Can I come with you?
- No, you can't.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.342
Toto, go away!

08:40.687 --> 08:42.397
Alfredo!

08:47.819 --> 08:49.613
You can start.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.336
Here we go again.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.524
The frame!

09:35.659 --> 09:38.453
THE LOWER DEPTHS

09:56.930 --> 09:59.850
<i>One day, everything will be ours.</i>

10:00.767 --> 10:03.437
<i>We'll go away together.</i>

10:04.396 --> 10:06.565
<i>To live the good life …</i>

10:07.357 --> 10:09.192
<i>… where no one knows us.</i>

10:09.735 --> 10:11.945
<i>Stop dreaming.</i>

10:12.696 --> 10:15.115
<i>You don't love me any more.</i>

10:16.241 --> 10:18.035
<i>Why?</i>

10:33.425 --> 10:36.845
<i>I'd have preferred a good word.</i>

10:36.970 --> 10:39.931
<i>- I can't.
- Oh, well.</i>

12:26.747 --> 12:29.583
100 lire! Pure nylon!

12:46.183 --> 12:48.685
You mustn't come here.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.979
How many times
do I have to tell you?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.522
You're only little.

12:52.647 --> 12:57.444
If there's a fire,
you'll go up in smoke.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.489
"And turn into a piece of charcoal."

13:03.116 --> 13:05.368
You've got a big mouth.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.413
One of these days I'll cut it off.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.334
Like that.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.724
Can I have it?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.894
Please can I have it?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.898
Well, can I or not?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.069
Are you deaf or something?

13:39.194 --> 13:41.988
I have to splice it back
before I return the film.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.075
You're such a pest!

13:46.076 --> 13:51.331
Then why didn't you splice these
before you returned the films?

13:53.500 --> 13:58.171
Well, sometimes I can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.215
They kiss too much, anyway.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.929
- Then I can have these.
- Now you listen to me.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.977
Let's make a deal,
before I kick you up the arse.

14:12.102 --> 14:16.356
- All these are yours, a present.
- Thank you.

14:16.481 --> 14:20.944
But first, you don't come here again.
Second, I keep them here. Get it?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.823
OK, so we're agreed.
Now, scram!

14:37.168 --> 14:39.421
What kind of deal is that?

14:39.546 --> 14:42.757
If they're mine,
how come you keep them?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.723
Don't come back
or I'll thrash you!

14:59.149 --> 15:00.442
"Shoot first, think later.

15:01.151 --> 15:05.989
"This is no job for weaklings,
cuckolds and traitors.

15:10.243 --> 15:14.998
"Hey, you bastard!
Hands off that gold!

15:18.627 --> 15:22.172
"Stay away from me,
you dirty swine …

15:23.089 --> 15:26.009
"… or I'll smash your face in!"

15:44.653 --> 15:48.031
If the war's over,
why doesn't Dad come back?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.577
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

15:54.037 --> 15:58.166
I don't remember him anymore.
Where is Russia?

15:59.000 --> 16:04.005
It takes years to get there …
and years to come back.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.259
Go to bed, Toto. It's late.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.632
You can fool your mother,
but not me.

16:48.717 --> 16:53.722
Get your piece of paper and join
the police, you little wretch!

17:02.772 --> 17:04.607
Come on!

17:17.704 --> 17:20.832
Well? How much is 5 x 5?

17:23.960 --> 17:24.878
30.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.681
Quiet! The five times table,
you dimwit!

17:36.806 --> 17:38.850
1 x 5 = 5.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.686
2 x 5 = 10.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.397
3 x 5 = 15.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.150
4 x 5 = 20.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.694
5 x 5?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.030
40.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.501
Quiet! Quiet!

18:05.043 --> 18:06.336
Boccia!

18:07.712 --> 18:09.547
25.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.930
For the last time …

18:17.055 --> 18:20.475
- 5 x 5?
- Christmas!

19:00.682 --> 19:04.185
I've a ticket,
I want to see the film.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.438
Get down. You can't stay here.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.649
Go back to your seat!

19:09.774 --> 19:13.736
They're all over the place,
like rabbits.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.751
<i>I must go to Oregon.
Wait for me at my ranch.</i>

19:29.961 --> 19:31.838
<i>Wait for a dead man?</i>

19:32.463 --> 19:35.508
<i>A star-studded cast</i>

19:35.633 --> 19:39.262
<i>featuring John Wayne,
Claire Trevor …</i>

19:51.649 --> 19:55.486
Good evening, everyone!
Can't I say hello?

19:55.612 --> 19:59.949
- Double-bill today.
- So what? I come here to sleep.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.209
Cut the news, Alfredo!

20:12.503 --> 20:14.714
ITALY DOESN'T FORGET.
RESISTANCE RALLY.

20:15.506 --> 20:18.092
Quiet! This is important.

20:18.218 --> 20:23.723
<i>The men and women who fought
in the Resistance</i>

20:23.848 --> 20:27.518
<i>are reunited in Rome
for the First Resistance Rally</i>

20:27.644 --> 20:32.899
<i>organised by CVL.
Prime Minister Parri …</i>

20:48.248 --> 20:50.500
Hello, everybody!

20:52.293 --> 20:56.798
- Can we watch the film or what?
- You shut up, then.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.717
THE EARTH TREMBLES —
EPISODE OF THE SEA

20:59.842 --> 21:02.178
Featuring
SICILIAN FISHERMEN

21:20.822 --> 21:21.948
What does it say?

21:22.073 --> 21:25.451
- Who knows? I'm illiterate.
- You too?

21:30.873 --> 21:35.044
The Italian language is not spoken
by the poor in Sicily.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.464
<i>12 hours of blood and sweat</i>

21:38.589 --> 21:43.636
<i>to take home the bare minimum
required not to die of hunger.</i>

21:44.595 --> 21:47.265
<i>And yet, their nets</i>

21:47.390 --> 21:50.977
<i>were full when they
pulled them up.</i>

21:51.102 --> 21:55.690
<i>All day fishing, and what do
we have to show for it?</i>

21:55.815 --> 21:57.525
<i>That may be so</i>

21:57.650 --> 22:03.239
<i>but what can we do?</i>

22:31.434 --> 22:32.894
I knew it!

22:34.812 --> 22:38.483
20 years going to the cinema,
and I've never seen a kiss!

22:39.317 --> 22:41.652
Will we ever?

22:45.156 --> 22:47.075
Son of a bitch!

22:53.081 --> 22:55.792
THE END

23:47.301 --> 23:50.221
- You and you, to work.
- What about me, Don Vincenzo?

23:50.346 --> 23:53.891
You? Get a job from Stalin.

23:54.016 --> 23:58.729
Don't you worry,
his day will come.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.231
I always get left out.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.861
Nice film.
That young man worked ever so hard.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.612
Pity he was so unlucky.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.782
Why did he go and buy that boat?

24:09.907 --> 24:12.827
Idiot!
You didn't understand anything.

24:14.495 --> 24:19.584
Right, boys. Here you work
from dawn to dusk.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.211
And no questions about pay.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.618
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you buy the milk?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.289
And the money?

24:59.207 --> 25:00.458
Stolen.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.420
You went to the cinema?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.342
The cinema!

25:13.012 --> 25:17.767
- Signora Maria, wait!
- Leave him alone, you're hurting him.

25:17.892 --> 25:23.564
And you, why do you tell lies?
You know you got in free.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.942
Go on, tell your mother.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.820
Maybe he lost it inside.
How much?

25:29.946 --> 25:31.531
50 lire.

25:33.366 --> 25:36.827
What did you find under
the seats tonight?

25:41.541 --> 25:42.959
A comb …

25:46.837 --> 25:48.506
two heels …

25:51.634 --> 25:52.843
a tobacco pouch …

25:52.969 --> 25:54.262
And …

25:54.887 --> 25:57.348
50 lire.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.731
See?

26:06.524 --> 26:10.778
Thank you, Alfredo.
Good night.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.447
- Good morning.
- Good night.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.666
I understood right away.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.919
The square is mine!

26:30.881 --> 26:37.013
It's midnight! Out!
I must close the square.

28:05.393 --> 28:08.062
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

28:08.938 --> 28:12.191
Going, it's downhill
and all the saints help you.

28:12.316 --> 28:16.028
Coming back,
the saints just watch.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.572
If it is God's will …

28:19.448 --> 28:21.242
See you tonight.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.375
What's wrong?
Your foot this time?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.794
Always something.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.589
Oh dear, what can we do?

28:39.760 --> 28:42.680
Did you know my father, Alfredo?

28:42.805 --> 28:45.516
Of course I knew him.

28:45.641 --> 28:50.438
Tall, thin, good-tempered,
with a moustache like mine.

28:50.563 --> 28:54.108
He always smiled.
He looked like Clark Gable.

28:54.233 --> 28:58.988
Now I'm older, Alfredo,
and I'm in the fifth year,

28:59.113 --> 29:05.119
I'm not asking to go into the booth,
but couldn't we at least be friends?

29:05.745 --> 29:10.750
"I choose my friends for their looks,
and my enemies for their intelligence."

29:10.875 --> 29:14.003
You're too clever to be my friend.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.839
I always tell my children

29:16.964 --> 29:20.176
to be careful how they
choose their friends.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.845
But you don't have any children.

29:25.014 --> 29:27.641
But when I do, I'll tell them.

29:32.563 --> 29:36.942
Don't cry.
It's all right, I'm here.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.653
The fire's out.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.073
Mum, what happened?

29:43.199 --> 29:44.992
You scoundrel!

29:45.117 --> 29:50.498
Your sister could have burned
to death because of you!

29:50.623 --> 29:54.418
You'll be the end of me!

29:55.252 --> 29:58.964
I told you not to keep
your films near the fire.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.884
You even burned my photos.

30:11.018 --> 30:14.730
- You and your films!
- He was burning down the house.

30:20.236 --> 30:24.114
Aren't you ashamed of playing
games with him at your age?

30:24.240 --> 30:28.619
- What have I done?
- Who gave him the films?

30:30.788 --> 30:33.749
You shouldn't give them to him,
he's mad!

30:33.874 --> 30:37.545
All he talks about is you
and the cinema.

30:39.046 --> 30:42.174
Swear you won't let him in again.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.554
I give you my word.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.936
May God send your father home,
he'll deal with you.

30:54.728 --> 30:59.525
Dad is not coming back,
and I know why. He's dead.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.027
No, it's not true!

31:04.488 --> 31:06.699
He'll be back, you'll see.

31:37.396 --> 31:43.402
<i>"And so the good and evil of men comes
and goes, and time is like a flowing river."</i>

31:47.281 --> 31:51.869
THE END

32:04.965 --> 32:07.509
They smoke like chimneys.

32:15.643 --> 32:18.604
Go and buy a ticket!

32:41.877 --> 32:45.130
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

32:59.603 --> 33:01.730
Signora Anna!

33:23.168 --> 33:26.964
Don't blame me, your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

33:27.089 --> 33:29.883
- Give it to me.
- I told Mum

33:30.009 --> 33:34.346
you didn't give me the film.
It wasn't your fault.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.807
I thought you were joking
when you said

33:36.932 --> 33:39.393
the film could catch fire.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.563
I just wanted to tell you.
Now I'll go.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.901
Toto … come here.

33:50.237 --> 33:53.115
Come and sit down.

33:55.868 --> 33:59.872
Now, listen.
I started this job when I was ten.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.751
We didn't have these
modern machines then.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.713
Films were silent.

34:07.838 --> 34:11.925
You turned the projector by hand
with a crank.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.428
All day long!

34:14.553 --> 34:17.139
And it was hard,
this damned crank.

34:18.015 --> 34:21.935
If you got tired,
and slowed down a bit …

34:22.978 --> 34:26.607
everything was burned,
in a flash.

34:29.068 --> 34:34.573
So why don't you teach me,
now there's no crank and it's easy?

34:35.365 --> 34:37.326
Because I don't want to, Toto.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.330
This is no job for you.

34:41.455 --> 34:45.667
You work like a slave,
always alone.

34:45.793 --> 34:49.296
You watch the same film 100 times.
Nothing else to do.

34:49.421 --> 34:53.509
You end up talking to Greta Garbo
and Tyrone Power.

34:53.634 --> 34:58.806
Always working.
Every holiday, Easter, Christmas …

34:59.973 --> 35:02.184
You only get Good Friday off.

35:02.309 --> 35:08.273
And if they hadn't put Christ on a cross,
we'd work even then.

35:08.398 --> 35:11.193
So why don't you change jobs?

35:18.700 --> 35:20.285
Because I'm stupid.

35:22.538 --> 35:27.709
Who else around here would
be a projectionist? No one.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.921
It takes an imbecile like me.

35:32.256 --> 35:34.424
It's my luck.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.137
When I was little,
there was the war.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.850
When I grew up,
there was another war.

35:45.227 --> 35:49.523
So, you want to be
a stick-in-the-mud like me?

35:51.984 --> 35:55.696
Good boy.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.448
It's for your own good.

35:58.574 --> 35:59.908
Always stuck in here.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.162
Boiling hot in summer,
freezing cold in winter.

36:03.287 --> 36:07.833
Breathing in fumes,
and earning a pittance.

36:08.959 --> 36:12.087
Is it all bad?

36:12.212 --> 36:15.757
You get used to it.
And then, from up here

36:15.883 --> 36:17.718
when the cinema is full,

36:17.843 --> 36:22.848
you hear people laughing,
and that makes you happy.

36:22.973 --> 36:25.017
It makes you feel good.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.478
Like you're the one
who makes them laugh

36:29.354 --> 36:32.649
and makes them forget
their troubles.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.485
That, I like.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.918
You didn't hear a word I said.
What are you up to?

36:52.085 --> 36:54.922
I can't turn my back for a minute.

36:55.047 --> 36:58.926
Your mother is right.
You're mad!

36:59.927 --> 37:03.847
How on earth did he do it?
He watches and learns.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.646
I'll tell the manager not to let you in.
Did you hear?

37:11.355 --> 37:13.148
And I'll tell Father Adelfio.

37:13.273 --> 37:17.402
No more altar boy,
you understand?

37:17.527 --> 37:19.154
Alfredo!

37:19.279 --> 37:21.073
Get stuffed!

37:29.248 --> 37:33.377
I've won! I've won the pools!

37:40.467 --> 37:44.346
Ciccio from Naples
has won the pools!

37:45.430 --> 37:51.144
The Neapolitan has won the pools!
Come along, quick.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.564
These Northerners have
all the luck!

38:29.266 --> 38:31.476
The square is mine!

38:35.147 --> 38:39.484
Keep still! Are the horse-flies
bothering you?

38:40.152 --> 38:43.822
You've a louse factory up here.
Off you go.

38:59.504 --> 39:03.342
What do you want?
Off you go.

39:12.893 --> 39:17.647
A shopkeeper owns two shops.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.361
In one, he sells fruit …

39:24.029 --> 39:25.113
Be seated.

39:26.031 --> 39:31.370
Here are the external candidates
for the School Certificate.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.586
Quiet!

39:43.215 --> 39:44.841
Quiet!

41:32.199 --> 41:34.743
Rotten little stinker!

41:35.327 --> 41:38.038
- Help me, Toto.
- Quiet!

41:39.664 --> 41:42.959
- I haven't got a clue!
- Quiet!

43:03.873 --> 43:05.709
<i>Francesco Messana.</i>

43:05.834 --> 43:07.794
<i>In the name of the law,
you're under arrest.</i>

43:23.893 --> 43:26.980
Son of a bitch! Pencil-pusher!

43:27.105 --> 43:29.983
This is where it can catch fire.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.902
If it does, you cut here and there

43:33.028 --> 43:36.948
or the whole reel will burn.
Got it?

43:41.328 --> 43:45.415
I won't stand for this sort of thing!

43:45.540 --> 43:48.418
Which side is the gelatine on?

43:49.961 --> 43:51.921
It tastes good.

44:01.765 --> 44:06.144
These are the invoices.
Always keep them safe.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.564
- Yes, Alfredo.
- Don't ever forget.

44:28.291 --> 44:32.837
This is for you.
Today you can load the reels.

44:34.005 --> 44:37.676
- It's so high up.
- Now you can do it alone.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.303
Stay still.

44:44.265 --> 44:46.101
What a woman!

44:47.185 --> 44:50.939
Children, say goodbye to Peppino.
He's going to Germany.

45:00.115 --> 45:02.701
Why won't you say goodbye
to your friend?

45:02.826 --> 45:06.079
My father says he's a Communist.

45:06.913 --> 45:08.248
God bless you, Mum.

45:08.373 --> 45:11.793
- Will he find work in Germany?
- Who knows?

45:12.335 --> 45:15.964
It's like an adventure.
You live in hope.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.551
Screw this country!

45:20.802 --> 45:24.222
Go and work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

45:28.226 --> 45:31.730
Goodbye, Peppino!
Come back soon.

45:39.779 --> 45:43.450
At least Germany is closer
than Russia.

45:47.412 --> 45:50.957
<i>After six years,
the return of spring fashion.</i>

45:51.082 --> 45:53.460
<i>A fresh new look</i>

45:53.585 --> 45:56.004
<i>unlike the pompous styles
of wartime.</i>

46:14.063 --> 46:16.691
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

46:36.878 --> 46:39.672
LOOKING FOR NEWS,
WRITE TO US

46:40.548 --> 46:44.469
<i>Another sad page in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.</i>

46:45.303 --> 46:50.058
<i>The Ministry of Defence has released
a new list of Italian dead</i>

46:50.183 --> 46:53.019
<i>until now considered missing.</i>

46:53.144 --> 46:57.941
<i>The names will be posted
by the military authorities.</i>

46:58.066 --> 47:02.278
<i>All the families concerned
will be notified.</i>

47:06.324 --> 47:10.203
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he's buried.

47:10.328 --> 47:13.748
Here is the pension form
for you to sign.

47:55.081 --> 47:58.585
<i>Hadn't I told you?
He's courting me.</i>

47:59.210 --> 48:01.337
<i>Well, he's no oil painting …</i>

49:53.074 --> 49:55.660
Go home, we can't have
another show.

49:55.785 --> 50:01.040
It's late, can't you understand?

50:02.917 --> 50:05.461
Some people have seen it twice.

50:08.506 --> 50:11.634
We've been waiting an hour.

50:16.764 --> 50:20.351
Tomorrow we'll show another film.

50:20.476 --> 50:24.397
A Western, I promise!
Go to bed.

50:25.231 --> 50:31.779
Close the doors.
They'll wreck the Paradiso. Hell, even.

50:35.491 --> 50:38.411
Alfredo, you let us in!

50:38.536 --> 50:41.372
What do you want me to do?

50:41.998 --> 50:44.834
We've been waiting for hours.

50:45.877 --> 50:48.171
"The mob doesn't think.

50:49.047 --> 50:51.132
"It has no mind of its own."

50:52.550 --> 50:56.429
The great Spencer Tracy
said it in "Fury".

50:56.554 --> 50:58.389
Well, what do you say?

50:59.891 --> 51:03.269
Shall we let the poor devils
see the film?

51:04.812 --> 51:08.191
I wish we could, but how?

51:10.151 --> 51:14.989
"If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see."

51:15.114 --> 51:18.201
So, get your arse off that stool.

51:21.954 --> 51:23.873
Pay attention.

51:30.004 --> 51:32.090
Now we pass through these walls.

52:07.375 --> 52:10.128
Look out of the window, kid.

52:14.757 --> 52:17.385
It's beautiful, Alfredo!

52:18.427 --> 52:21.931
Over there! Look, the cinema!

52:31.107 --> 52:33.526
Thank you, Alfredo!

52:40.533 --> 52:43.077
What on earth is going on?

52:44.871 --> 52:46.998
It's the cinema.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.335
Go to hell!

52:58.092 --> 53:00.678
There's no sound, Alfredo.

53:00.803 --> 53:02.513
Shall we keep them happy?

53:37.089 --> 53:39.091
Want to go down?

53:57.985 --> 53:59.612
- Come. Look at this.
- Oh, my God!

54:06.327 --> 54:11.040
- Ah, Nunzio! Half price will do.
- As you wish.

54:21.384 --> 54:23.678
You must buy tickets, folks.

54:27.723 --> 54:28.975
Half price.

54:29.100 --> 54:32.061
Get stuffed! The square
belongs to everyone.

54:34.438 --> 54:38.985
The square is mine!
Don't joke about it, it makes me mad.

56:24.006 --> 56:25.674
Run!

56:51.659 --> 56:56.288
Oh, my God, what's happened?
I can't believe it.

57:32.867 --> 57:35.161
Help!

57:40.583 --> 57:41.709
Help!

57:53.762 --> 57:56.432
Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.810
It's all burned down.

58:04.690 --> 58:07.151
All burned down!

58:24.001 --> 58:25.586
What do we do now?

58:25.711 --> 58:29.840
No more entertainment
in the village, nothing.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.843
How can we rebuild all this?

58:35.012 --> 58:39.099
Look at Ciccio from Naples.
You'd hardly know him.

58:39.225 --> 58:41.810
Who has that kind of money?

58:50.819 --> 58:52.821
The New Cinema Paradiso!

59:29.358 --> 59:32.486
This cinema is for you!

59:40.244 --> 59:43.581
He's just a boy. What about
the child labour laws?

59:43.706 --> 59:47.918
I got a licence through
my connections.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.129
But don't ask me how it works.

59:50.254 --> 59:54.091
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

59:54.800 --> 59:59.096
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No falling asleep.

59:59.221 --> 1:00:01.140
No more disasters.

1:00:01.265 --> 1:00:04.393
Do as poor Alfredo taught you.

1:00:04.518 --> 1:00:06.228
And God bless you, son.

1:00:07.521 --> 1:00:09.273
Thank you, Father.

1:00:09.398 --> 1:00:14.737
What's this? A funeral?
Life goes on. Music!

1:01:30.062 --> 1:01:32.272
<i>You've fallen in love
with that peasant?</i>

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:34.858
<i>Maybe.</i>

1:01:37.611 --> 1:01:40.072
<i>And he's asked you to marry him?</i>

1:01:45.828 --> 1:01:47.955
<i>Then it's all over between us?</i>

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:56.922
What a dish!

1:02:21.405 --> 1:02:23.699
My God, they're kissing!

1:02:28.454 --> 1:02:31.123
I shall not watch pornographic films.

1:02:36.754 --> 1:02:38.589
Bravo, Don Ciccio!

1:03:09.578 --> 1:03:12.039
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

1:03:17.669 --> 1:03:21.924
Bring him home afterwards, Toto.
I'm going now, Alfredo.

1:03:22.633 --> 1:03:24.718
I'm so glad you're here.

1:03:28.388 --> 1:03:30.516
How is school?

1:03:30.641 --> 1:03:34.102
Fine, but now I'm working

1:03:34.228 --> 1:03:36.188
maybe I won't go any more.

1:03:39.525 --> 1:03:45.155
Don't do that, Toto.
You'll end up with egg on your face.

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.324
What does that mean?

1:03:47.908 --> 1:03:49.618
It means …

1:03:51.245 --> 1:03:55.666
that this is no job for you.

1:03:55.791 --> 1:03:57.960
Now the Paradiso needs you

1:03:58.085 --> 1:04:01.463
and you need the Paradiso.
But it won't last.

1:04:03.799 --> 1:04:07.052
One day you'll move on
to other things.

1:04:08.095 --> 1:04:09.888
Other things.

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:13.600
More important things.

1:04:13.725 --> 1:04:15.352
Much more important.

1:04:18.939 --> 1:04:22.359
I know. Now I've lost my sight …

1:04:22.901 --> 1:04:24.319
I see better.

1:04:25.445 --> 1:04:27.281
Things I never saw before.

1:04:27.948 --> 1:04:32.870
Thanks to you, who saved my life,
I'll never forget.

1:04:34.371 --> 1:04:36.373
Don't look so gloomy.

1:04:37.124 --> 1:04:40.460
I'm not gaga yet. Want proof?

1:04:41.336 --> 1:04:45.257
Let's see.
Right now, for instance …

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:50.637
the film is out of focus.
Check it.

1:04:54.892 --> 1:04:59.521
You're right, it's out of focus.
How did you do?

1:04:59.646 --> 1:05:03.400
It's difficult to explain.

1:05:13.702 --> 1:05:17.748
Only two days? I don't give a shit
about other cinemas.

1:05:17.873 --> 1:05:21.501
I'll be crucified if I can't show
the film for more than two days.

1:05:22.544 --> 1:05:27.299
Even if we open at 8 in the morning,
we still can't do it.

1:05:27.424 --> 1:05:29.801
It's a big place and you know it.

1:05:29.927 --> 1:05:34.765
I could make life very difficult
for you by writing to Rome.

1:05:34.890 --> 1:05:39.019
I'm warning you.
Don't mess with me or you'll regret it.

1:05:39.519 --> 1:05:41.647
I have an idea, Don Ciccio.

1:05:41.772 --> 1:05:45.067
Remember the old cinema
in the next village?

1:05:46.234 --> 1:05:51.239
The projector's gone rusty
but I could easily fix it.

1:05:51.365 --> 1:05:56.078
Get the cinema cleaned up,
hire a projectionist

1:05:56.203 --> 1:05:58.246
and we show the film
in both places.

1:05:58.372 --> 1:06:02.167
Don't be stupid.
You should know better, Toto.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.545
I'm lucky that they send me
the one copy.

1:06:05.671 --> 1:06:07.047
Imagine if I asked for two.

1:06:07.172 --> 1:06:11.009
They'd chop my head off
and play ball with it.

1:06:12.010 --> 1:06:14.930
- Who says we need two copies?
- You mean we don't?

1:06:51.091 --> 1:06:53.969
<i>I swore on the Virgin Mary
to my son.</i>

1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:57.723
We see a child asleep in her bed.

1:07:17.951 --> 1:07:19.161
<i>Get something, hurry.</i>

1:07:22.998 --> 1:07:26.251
"The lawyer told me.
Now I know."

1:07:26.376 --> 1:07:29.421
<i>The lawyer told me.
Now I know.</i>

1:07:30.172 --> 1:07:35.093
"Everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know."

1:07:35.552 --> 1:07:36.928
<i>Everyone must know.</i>

1:07:39.264 --> 1:07:41.933
"Do you … believe me?"

1:07:42.059 --> 1:07:43.268
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

1:07:44.519 --> 1:07:46.396
"Yes. I believe you."

1:07:46.521 --> 1:07:49.816
<i>Yes. I believe you.</i>

1:07:58.408 --> 1:08:01.286
"Our own home.
How I've dreamt of it!"

1:08:01.411 --> 1:08:04.331
<i>- Our own home.
- How I've dreamt of it!</i>

1:08:11.838 --> 1:08:12.881
"Tonino!"

1:08:13.006 --> 1:08:17.010
<i>Tonino! Mamma! My son!</i>

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:41.576
The End.

1:08:41.701 --> 1:08:45.622
THE END

1:08:50.877 --> 1:08:54.381
I don't like it! I don't like it!

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:02.514
I cut the end credits
to go faster.

1:09:04.141 --> 1:09:07.477
Bring me Part One,
while I show a newsreel

1:09:07.602 --> 1:09:14.317
I'll call the police. Take him, he's
seen it ten times. One moment!

1:09:36.131 --> 1:09:38.675
Here's Part One, Boccia.

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:42.137
Hurry!
The house is packed.

1:09:44.139 --> 1:09:48.435
What are you doing?
Get the bloody thing rolling.

1:09:49.352 --> 1:09:51.313
People are getting restless.

1:09:58.987 --> 1:10:02.282
Bunch of animals! Shut up!

1:10:24.429 --> 1:10:26.348
To hell with it!

1:10:32.729 --> 1:10:36.900
When is it starting, Toto?
We've got work to do tomorrow.

1:10:40.153 --> 1:10:42.781
Toto, what's going on?
They're furious.

1:10:42.906 --> 1:10:44.991
It's been half an hour.

1:10:45.116 --> 1:10:46.868
And what do you want me to do?

1:10:49.329 --> 1:10:53.333
Where's that son of a bitch?
I'll be ruined.

1:11:00.048 --> 1:11:06.429
I'll have you know I left my wife sick
in bed in order to watch this film.

1:11:06.554 --> 1:11:08.723
And I still haven't seen a thing.

1:11:08.848 --> 1:11:14.646
If it doesn't start in 10 minutes,
we want our money back.

1:11:14.771 --> 1:11:17.190
Or I'll give you a taste
of my cane.

1:11:23.947 --> 1:11:26.658
Calm down.
Can I say something?

1:11:26.783 --> 1:11:29.786
I'll show you Part One again.

1:11:29.911 --> 1:11:35.417
- We've seen Part One.
- We want to know how it ends.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:39.671
Quiet!

1:11:39.796 --> 1:11:43.800
I've already seen it.
I'll tell you how it ends.

1:12:15.332 --> 1:12:17.500
Boccia, what's wrong?

1:12:24.382 --> 1:12:27.260
- You idiot!
- This is good.

1:12:27.385 --> 1:12:29.387
Go away! Go.

1:13:04.547 --> 1:13:08.259
What are you doing?
Watch the screen, you pigs.

1:13:19.854 --> 1:13:20.980
Behave yourself.

1:14:18.079 --> 1:14:19.914
I told you, it doesn't catch fire.

1:14:23.835 --> 1:14:26.129
Progress always comes too late.

1:14:26.254 --> 1:14:29.799
SEVEN BRIDES
FOR SEVEN BROTHERS

1:14:29.924 --> 1:14:31.384
AND SEVEN
UNFORGETTABLE SONGS

1:14:46.774 --> 1:14:48.568
<i>Workers of the world …</i>

1:15:22.936 --> 1:15:25.522
Go on, stick it in.

1:15:25.647 --> 1:15:27.273
Don't be afraid.

1:15:27.398 --> 1:15:30.318
Is it true that if I bleed I should
squeeze lemon on it?

1:15:34.197 --> 1:15:37.492
Where did you get that from,
you silly boy?

1:15:39.577 --> 1:15:42.539
Go on, stick it in. Don't worry.

1:15:43.665 --> 1:15:46.709
Like this, you see?

1:15:47.168 --> 1:15:51.839
See? Nothing happens.
Good boy.

1:16:04.936 --> 1:16:06.646
Now you're a man.

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:11.067
What am I saying? A young bull,
that's what you are.

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:56.613
She's new.

1:16:57.739 --> 1:16:59.282
Not bad.

1:16:59.824 --> 1:17:01.159
She's nice.

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:04.954
Her father's a bank manager,
a big shot.

1:17:05.079 --> 1:17:08.708
Jerks it off with his shirt,
not to get his hands dirty.

1:17:13.546 --> 1:17:15.506
Faster, faster.

1:17:17.508 --> 1:17:19.761
Last one's a sissy.

1:17:32.023 --> 1:17:33.524
Excuse me.

1:17:39.572 --> 1:17:41.574
You dropped this.

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:44.452
Thanks. I hadn't noticed.

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:52.251
- I'm Salvatore. And you?
- Elena. My name is Elena.

1:17:53.086 --> 1:17:57.674
I wanted to tell you the other day,
at the station …

1:18:02.679 --> 1:18:06.557
Charles Chaplin's "Modern Times".
Right, Toto?

1:18:08.559 --> 1:18:11.896
I know it by heart.

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:16.150
I showed it in 1940, on the Sunday
my first wife died.

1:18:16.275 --> 1:18:20.822
They kept it from me all day so they
wouldn't have to close the cinema.

1:18:20.947 --> 1:18:23.449
I only found out at the end.

1:18:25.576 --> 1:18:27.704
It's stuck in my mind.

1:18:30.748 --> 1:18:32.709
I'll never forget.

1:18:34.877 --> 1:18:37.755
What is it? Is it your footage?

1:18:38.464 --> 1:18:39.632
What do you see?

1:18:40.091 --> 1:18:43.428
A young bull being slaughtered.

1:18:44.178 --> 1:18:48.057
A big pool of blood
on the ground.

1:18:48.182 --> 1:18:50.601
Another young bull steps
over the blood …

1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:52.979
on its way to its death.

1:18:59.819 --> 1:19:02.780
What do you see now?
Tell me.

1:19:02.905 --> 1:19:06.242
Nothing, it's out of focus.

1:19:09.537 --> 1:19:11.038
A woman.

1:19:12.915 --> 1:19:14.625
It's a woman!

1:19:17.378 --> 1:19:19.589
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

1:19:19.714 --> 1:19:22.008
What's she like?

1:19:22.592 --> 1:19:24.135
She's very nice.

1:19:25.136 --> 1:19:29.432
My age, slim,
with long brown hair.

1:19:30.391 --> 1:19:33.686
She has big blue eyes
and a clear gaze.

1:19:33.811 --> 1:19:36.147
A beauty spot on her lip.

1:19:36.272 --> 1:19:39.150
Tiny one, you only see it close.

1:19:39.942 --> 1:19:43.738
And when she smiles, you feel …
I don't know.

1:19:46.657 --> 1:19:48.618
Love.

1:19:55.082 --> 1:19:57.627
I know how it is, Toto.

1:19:57.752 --> 1:20:00.797
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

1:20:00.922 --> 1:20:06.302
You can never get close to them,
whatever you do.

1:20:06.427 --> 1:20:10.348
"The bigger the man,
the deeper the imprint.

1:20:10.473 --> 1:20:15.853
"And when he's in love, he suffers
knowing it's a dead end."

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:19.607
It's nice what you say, but sad.

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:23.361
I didn't say it.

1:20:23.486 --> 1:20:26.405
It was John Wayne in
"The Shepherd of the Hills".

1:20:27.281 --> 1:20:29.408
You old sneak!

1:21:10.908 --> 1:21:14.537
- Hello, Elena.
- Hi! Why are you running?

1:21:16.122 --> 1:21:17.582
Because …

1:21:19.292 --> 1:21:22.753
I wanted to tell you …

1:21:22.879 --> 1:21:25.339
You remember when …?

1:21:27.842 --> 1:21:29.677
Nice day, isn't it?

1:21:34.682 --> 1:21:36.809
Yes, beautiful day.

1:21:39.478 --> 1:21:42.398
Excuse me, I must go.
Bye, Salvatore.

1:21:46.777 --> 1:21:50.615
What a jerk!

1:21:51.866 --> 1:21:54.702
"Nice day, isn't it?"
How stupid!

1:22:06.088 --> 1:22:07.423
You don't believe me.

1:22:07.548 --> 1:22:09.842
But I'll be the man in your life.

1:22:10.676 --> 1:22:12.970
I'm not Marlon Brando, I know.

1:22:13.095 --> 1:22:17.099
But take a good look at me.
I'm not that bad, am I?

1:22:20.937 --> 1:22:25.441
Shall I try again?
Maybe this time I'll succeed.

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.577
Please may I speak to Elena?

1:22:37.536 --> 1:22:39.538
Is that you, Elena?

1:22:39.664 --> 1:22:43.709
Sorry, I didn't recognise you.
I'm Salvatore, remember?

1:22:45.002 --> 1:22:51.175
I know I sound like an idiot whenever
we meet, but I'm not like that.

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:55.471
I can't find the words to say it,
but I can't stop thinking about you.

1:22:57.390 --> 1:23:02.937
I think of you night and day.
I dream of you every night.

1:23:03.062 --> 1:23:05.481
Sounds silly on the phone,
but I love you.

1:23:05.606 --> 1:23:07.942
<i>Stop this,
or I'll call the police.</i>

1:23:08.067 --> 1:23:11.654
- Who's that?
<i>- Elena's mother, you cretin.</i>

1:23:11.779 --> 1:23:15.658
I'm sorry, madam.
I really didn't know …

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.160
Bloody hell!

1:23:18.995 --> 1:23:23.332
I told you.
You thought I was kidding you.

1:23:23.457 --> 1:23:28.879
Take it from me.
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

1:23:29.005 --> 1:23:32.258
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

1:23:32.383 --> 1:23:38.180
Forget it, Toto.
Feelings can never be understood.

1:23:38.305 --> 1:23:43.352
- You can't explain them.
- Oh, you made the world!

1:23:43.477 --> 1:23:48.607
Hey, don't get angry with me.
What's come over you?

1:23:50.359 --> 1:23:51.861
Where are you?

1:23:51.986 --> 1:23:55.197
- Out of the way. You mad?
- Toto, come here!

1:23:59.785 --> 1:24:01.620
Can't see where I'm going.

1:24:12.465 --> 1:24:15.801
How dare you talk to me like that?

1:24:15.926 --> 1:24:18.679
With all due respect to the Lord,

1:24:18.804 --> 1:24:21.390
who made the world in three days.

1:24:21.515 --> 1:24:23.893
I'd have taken longer,

1:24:24.018 --> 1:24:27.063
but certain things
I could have done better.

1:24:27.188 --> 1:24:30.941
Like I said,
you have all the answers.

1:24:33.444 --> 1:24:37.948
I'll tell you a story.
Just for you, Toto.

1:24:38.074 --> 1:24:42.453
Let's sit down. God Almighty!

1:24:43.913 --> 1:24:45.706
Once upon a time …

1:24:47.041 --> 1:24:49.418
a king gave a feast.

1:24:49.543 --> 1:24:53.214
The most beautiful princesses
were there.

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:57.384
A soldier who was standing guard

1:24:57.510 --> 1:25:00.096
saw the king's daughter go by.

1:25:00.221 --> 1:25:04.850
She was the loveliest one,
and he fell instantly in love.

1:25:04.975 --> 1:25:11.607
But what is a simple soldier
next to the daughter of a king?

1:25:12.525 --> 1:25:15.986
One day he managed to meet her

1:25:16.112 --> 1:25:20.908
and told her he could no longer
live without her.

1:25:21.867 --> 1:25:26.497
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling

1:25:26.622 --> 1:25:29.125
that she said to the soldier,

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:34.130
"If you can wait for 100 days

1:25:34.255 --> 1:25:38.300
"and 100 nights under my balcony

1:25:38.425 --> 1:25:40.344
"I shall be yours."

1:25:43.389 --> 1:25:48.644
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day, two days

1:25:48.769 --> 1:25:50.896
then ten, twenty.

1:25:51.021 --> 1:25:56.318
Each evening the princess looked out,
and he never moved!

1:25:56.443 --> 1:26:00.281
Always there, come rain,
come thunder.

1:26:00.406 --> 1:26:05.661
Birds shat on his head,
bees stung him, but he didn't budge.

1:26:07.329 --> 1:26:12.168
After 90 nights …

1:26:14.211 --> 1:26:16.380
he had become …

1:26:18.632 --> 1:26:20.676
all dry and pale.

1:26:21.802 --> 1:26:25.556
Tears streamed from his eyes.

1:26:25.681 --> 1:26:27.725
He couldn't hold them back.

1:26:27.850 --> 1:26:32.271
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

1:26:32.396 --> 1:26:36.984
And all that time,
the princess watched him.

1:26:39.153 --> 1:26:42.198
When the 99th night came

1:26:42.323 --> 1:26:45.367
the soldier stood up,

1:26:45.492 --> 1:26:48.829
took his chair, and left.

1:26:48.954 --> 1:26:50.956
How come? Right at the end?

1:26:52.833 --> 1:26:54.835
Right at the end, Toto.

1:26:55.419 --> 1:26:58.339
Don't ask me what it means,
I don't know.

1:27:00.841 --> 1:27:03.677
If you can figure it out,
you tell me.

1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:05.531
Please, don't ask me why.

1:28:26.802 --> 1:28:31.265
What is it, Alfredo? Not now,
I must administer the sacrament.

1:28:31.390 --> 1:28:35.144
Father Adelfio,
I need you urgently.

1:28:35.269 --> 1:28:40.107
I have terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:50.242
- Father, I have sinned.
- Do that later.

1:28:51.618 --> 1:28:53.704
Please, don't turn around.

1:28:53.829 --> 1:28:57.458
- Just act normal. It's Salvatore.
- How did you get in here?

1:29:01.837 --> 1:29:06.050
- That's a terrible thing to say.
- I know.

1:29:06.175 --> 1:29:10.346
Take the miracle of
the loaves and fishes.

1:29:12.014 --> 1:29:15.976
I've often wondered.
How is it possible?

1:29:16.101 --> 1:29:22.483
It's terrible. Mum told Dad.
How could you mistake her voice?

1:29:22.608 --> 1:29:24.860
Sorry, Elena, I was stupid.

1:29:25.361 --> 1:29:27.654
But I had to talk to you.

1:29:36.872 --> 1:29:38.916
You're beautiful, Elena.

1:29:39.041 --> 1:29:40.751
That's what I wanted to say.

1:29:42.211 --> 1:29:45.214
I can never find the words
when I see you.

1:29:46.423 --> 1:29:48.467
I get the shivers.

1:29:49.885 --> 1:29:52.971
I don't know how other people do it.

1:29:53.097 --> 1:29:55.349
It's my first time.

1:29:57.768 --> 1:29:59.561
But I'm in love with you.

1:29:59.686 --> 1:30:01.688
Father, I have sinned.

1:30:02.481 --> 1:30:03.607
I absolve you from your sins

1:30:03.732 --> 1:30:07.611
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1:30:12.908 --> 1:30:15.369
You're even prettier
when you laugh.

1:30:22.584 --> 1:30:27.506
You're very sweet,
and I like you.

1:30:27.631 --> 1:30:29.925
But I'm not in love with you.

1:30:34.721 --> 1:30:37.975
- It's OK. I'll wait.
- For what?

1:30:38.475 --> 1:30:42.271
For you to love me.
Listen to me.

1:30:44.189 --> 1:30:46.817
Every night, after work

1:30:46.942 --> 1:30:50.279
I'll wait outside your house.
Every night.

1:30:51.363 --> 1:30:57.119
When you change your mind,
open your window. I'll understand.

1:30:57.244 --> 1:30:58.537
You understand now?

1:30:58.662 --> 1:31:03.750
Yes … finally, I see the light.

1:31:07.629 --> 1:31:11.383
Next time, don't talk heresy.

1:31:11.508 --> 1:31:13.343
You survived the fire
in the cinema.

1:31:13.469 --> 1:31:17.973
But from the eternal fire,
no one can save you.

1:32:48.313 --> 1:32:50.524
What's Toto doing?

1:32:51.567 --> 1:32:54.403
The cinema is closed at this hour.

1:33:11.795 --> 1:33:13.505
Attention, please!

1:33:14.089 --> 1:33:17.759
15 seconds to the New Year!

1:33:19.219 --> 1:33:22.848
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve,

1:33:22.973 --> 1:33:27.477
eleven, ten, nine, eight,

1:33:27.603 --> 1:33:32.482
seven, six, five, four,

1:33:32.608 --> 1:33:35.986
three, two, one!

1:33:37.487 --> 1:33:40.949
Don't worry, he must be
with his friends.

1:33:41.074 --> 1:33:44.620
- Cheers!
- Happy New Year!

1:33:47.539 --> 1:33:50.125
Happy New Year.

1:33:50.834 --> 1:33:52.711
Let's drink to Toto.

1:36:09.931 --> 1:36:12.309
Turn the lights on, Toto!

1:36:58.647 --> 1:37:01.274
Look, the car's still running in.

1:37:06.530 --> 1:37:08.657
How will we get home?

1:37:10.534 --> 1:37:12.327
Stop!

1:37:14.037 --> 1:37:16.039
Oh, my God! It's my father.

1:37:18.667 --> 1:37:20.001
Good evening.

1:37:35.183 --> 1:37:36.560
<i>Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.</i>

1:37:36.685 --> 1:37:42.107
<i>From Milan, we present
"Double or Quit".</i>

1:37:42.232 --> 1:37:44.150
<i>With Mike Bongiorno.</i>

1:37:51.032 --> 1:37:54.244
<i>I've forgotten what I had to say …</i>

1:37:54.953 --> 1:37:56.663
You pulling my leg?

1:37:56.788 --> 1:37:59.541
How can you watch TV
without a film?

1:38:00.125 --> 1:38:02.294
You just can, Alfredo.

1:38:03.044 --> 1:38:06.882
You can even buy a TV set
and watch it at home.

1:38:07.007 --> 1:38:11.761
This may be so, but I don't like it.
I can smell a rat.

1:38:11.887 --> 1:38:14.306
<i>- From Massa …
- Macinaia.</i>

1:38:15.515 --> 1:38:18.143
<i>I guess it's a village
near Massa Carrara?</i>

1:38:18.268 --> 1:38:20.103
<i>No, it's near Lucca …</i>

1:38:21.563 --> 1:38:23.940
Great idea, don't you think?

1:38:24.065 --> 1:38:29.404
Couldn't have bought the equipment
without a loan from your bank.

1:38:29.529 --> 1:38:32.282
Times have changed.

1:38:32.407 --> 1:38:35.744
It's a new machine.
A teleprojector.

1:38:40.665 --> 1:38:43.835
<i>- So, you are a landowner.
- Yes, I am.</i>

1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:46.296
<i>What's your area of expertise?</i>

1:38:46.421 --> 1:38:50.091
<i>- "The Divine Comedy".
- Very well.</i>

1:38:50.884 --> 1:38:55.972
Maybe your father doesn't like
what I do. He thinks I'm poor.

1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:02.479
We're going to Tuscany
in the summer.

1:39:03.438 --> 1:39:06.566
If you came,
we could meet in secret.

1:39:06.691 --> 1:39:10.695
I'm working at the outdoor cinema.
I'll miss you.

1:39:10.820 --> 1:39:14.115
Don't be sad.
I'll write every day.

1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:17.702
I'll be back at the end
of summer.

1:39:41.851 --> 1:39:45.522
Outdoor cinema tonight
at the Imperia.

1:39:46.690 --> 1:39:49.734
<i>Last one's a sissy!</i>

1:39:57.242 --> 1:39:59.244
Standing room only!

1:39:59.828 --> 1:40:02.956
You get in free and pay to leave.

1:40:11.631 --> 1:40:16.511
Come on in, the show's just started.
Have your tickets ready.

1:40:48.752 --> 1:40:52.255
<i>Salvatore, my love.
The days are never-ending here.</i>

1:40:52.380 --> 1:40:57.969
<i>I see your name everywhere,
in books, crosswords, newspapers.</i>

1:40:58.094 --> 1:41:00.263
<i>You're always before my eyes.</i>

1:41:00.388 --> 1:41:02.724
<i>Sadly, I have bad news.</i>

1:41:02.849 --> 1:41:06.352
<i>We're moving to Palermo,
because of university.</i>

1:41:06.478 --> 1:41:10.273
<i>It'll be difficult to see each other,
but don't worry.</i>

1:41:10.398 --> 1:41:14.569
<i>I'll come and see you
at the Paradiso.</i>

1:41:20.325 --> 1:41:24.370
<i>If only I'd have known, I'd have
changed my pants this morning.</i>

1:41:24.496 --> 1:41:26.372
<i>- Are you ready?
- Of course.</i>

1:41:26.498 --> 1:41:30.627
<i>I knew she was easy.</i>

1:41:32.754 --> 1:41:35.590
<i>- Guys, who's going to help me out?
- Coming!</i>

1:41:45.391 --> 1:41:48.853
Hey, I caught an octopus!

1:42:06.955 --> 1:42:12.752
Post for di Vita.
Every blessed day. Here!

1:42:13.628 --> 1:42:16.089
Hey, don't mess around.

1:42:47.203 --> 1:42:50.456
<i>Remember us and the wine
we produced in your cave!</i>

1:42:50.582 --> 1:42:54.961
<i>- Ulysses, he'll know where we are.
- Stop it, don't be scared.</i>

1:42:55.086 --> 1:42:56.462
<i>Who is the boss now?</i>

1:42:56.588 --> 1:43:00.175
<i>God with His might,
or man with his wit?</i>

1:43:28.536 --> 1:43:30.997
When will this bloody summer end?

1:43:32.207 --> 1:43:34.584
In a film, it'd already be over.

1:43:34.709 --> 1:43:38.671
Cut, and there's a storm.
Great!

1:43:53.144 --> 1:43:55.521
<i>Tell them I'm Ulysses!</i>

1:44:07.659 --> 1:44:09.827
Elena! But when …?

1:44:09.953 --> 1:44:14.749
Today. You can't imagine
the excuses I made up.

1:44:47.657 --> 1:44:50.785
Sophia Loren is always
Sophia Loren.

1:44:50.910 --> 1:44:54.247
Long legs and great boobs.

1:44:54.372 --> 1:44:57.875
- Like Lana Turner.
- More beautiful.

1:44:58.001 --> 1:45:02.922
- For Toto. You give it to him.
- What is it?

1:45:04.549 --> 1:45:08.636
The devil take me!
What will I do now?

1:45:13.141 --> 1:45:14.976
What did they say?

1:45:15.101 --> 1:45:19.105
That as a war orphan,
I'm exempt from military service.

1:45:19.230 --> 1:45:22.400
But nothing doing —
clerical error.

1:45:22.525 --> 1:45:28.156
Must go to Rome on Friday.
They say I'll be discharged in ten days.

1:45:28.281 --> 1:45:34.454
- You should go. My father's here.
- Good, I'll talk to him.

1:45:34.579 --> 1:45:36.289
This time I'll convince him.

1:45:36.414 --> 1:45:40.126
No, Salvatore.
He has other plans for me.

1:45:41.753 --> 1:45:43.087
Who?

1:45:43.212 --> 1:45:45.340
The son of a colleague of his.

1:45:45.465 --> 1:45:49.719
We'll talk about it on Thursday.
Wait for me at the Paradiso.

1:45:49.844 --> 1:45:52.680
I'll get the 5 o'clock bus.
I love you.

1:46:32.095 --> 1:46:34.806
It's a good film, Toto.

1:46:34.931 --> 1:46:37.558
But people here don't understand it.

1:46:37.683 --> 1:46:42.271
Tonight, load tomorrow's reels,
ready for the new man.

1:46:44.232 --> 1:46:49.487
Hey, cheer up!
I'll wait for you, don't worry.

1:46:49.612 --> 1:46:51.489
No one's taking your job.

1:46:51.614 --> 1:46:54.700
It'll be waiting for you.
Don't look so gloomy.

1:47:59.390 --> 1:48:01.559
You were expecting someone else?

1:48:02.393 --> 1:48:05.521
No, Alfredo.
I came down to help you.

1:48:05.646 --> 1:48:07.982
No, you were waiting for her.

1:48:09.233 --> 1:48:13.529
Not nice waiting alone.
I'll keep you company.

1:48:15.198 --> 1:48:17.074
Maybe you'd rather I went.

1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:21.120
No, don't go.
In fact, I need your help.

1:48:46.187 --> 1:48:48.856
I can't hear this.

1:49:15.550 --> 1:49:16.801
Open up!

1:49:33.651 --> 1:49:35.861
Open up! Elena!

1:49:50.793 --> 1:49:54.505
THE END

1:50:00.595 --> 1:50:01.887
I like it!

1:50:23.659 --> 1:50:24.910
I'm here.

1:50:25.036 --> 1:50:29.332
Where were you?
Where did you go?

1:50:29.457 --> 1:50:33.419
Calm down. Here, sit down.

1:50:37.673 --> 1:50:39.383
Did she come?

1:50:40.176 --> 1:50:42.511
No one came.

1:51:02.782 --> 1:51:06.494
Salvatore di Vita reporting for duty.

1:51:13.292 --> 1:51:15.836
I wish to know when
I'll be discharged, sir.

1:51:15.961 --> 1:51:19.382
No news as yet. Dismissed.

1:51:26.430 --> 1:51:31.477
Her father's been transferred
and no one knows where to?

1:51:31.602 --> 1:51:34.980
Sod you, bastard! You won't
bloody well tell me, will you?

1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:47.326
NOT KNOWN AT THIS ADDRESS

1:51:57.420 --> 1:52:01.924
I should have done ten days
and it's been a year, sir.

1:52:02.049 --> 1:52:04.093
Without a day's leave.

1:52:28.951 --> 1:52:32.288
Di Vita, you've been discharged.

1:54:11.303 --> 1:54:13.848
You've lost weight.

1:54:13.973 --> 1:54:16.267
They didn't treat you
very well, did they?

1:54:16.392 --> 1:54:21.897
They say you never go out
or talk to anyone. Why?

1:54:23.357 --> 1:54:25.192
You know how it is.

1:54:26.527 --> 1:54:29.405
Sooner or later, the time comes

1:54:29.530 --> 1:54:34.285
when it makes no difference
whether you talk or not.

1:54:36.579 --> 1:54:38.998
So you might as well shut up.

1:54:46.046 --> 1:54:47.381
It's hot in here.

1:54:49.383 --> 1:54:50.968
Take me to the sea.

1:54:51.093 --> 1:54:54.763
At Christmas, this lieutenant
pinches a girl's bum.

1:54:54.889 --> 1:54:58.601
She turns round.
It's the colonel's daughter.

1:54:58.726 --> 1:55:00.311
Terrified, he says,

1:55:00.436 --> 1:55:05.065
"If your heart is as hard as what
I've just felt, I'm a dead man."

1:55:11.780 --> 1:55:13.616
Have you seen her?

1:55:17.328 --> 1:55:19.121
No one knows where she is.

1:55:21.415 --> 1:55:24.919
It was probably meant
to be like this.

1:55:25.669 --> 1:55:30.132
Each of us has a star to follow.

1:55:30.257 --> 1:55:34.386
And now … what are you
planning to do?

1:55:44.563 --> 1:55:46.857
Listen to this one.

1:55:46.982 --> 1:55:49.526
The commander says
to the sergeant,

1:55:49.652 --> 1:55:53.948
"Remember when there was
a windmill there?"

1:55:55.199 --> 1:55:58.243
"Yes, sir. I remember.

1:55:58.369 --> 1:56:02.915
"The windmill's gone,
but the wind's still there."

1:56:11.924 --> 1:56:15.970
Remember the story about
the soldier and the princess?

1:56:27.481 --> 1:56:31.026
Now I understand why the soldier left
right at the end.

1:56:36.365 --> 1:56:39.994
One more night and the princess
would have been his.

1:56:40.119 --> 1:56:43.664
But she might not have
kept her promise.

1:56:43.789 --> 1:56:47.626
That would have been too cruel.
It would have killed him.

1:56:48.711 --> 1:56:55.009
This way, at least, for 99 nights
he lived in hope that she'd be his.

1:56:56.969 --> 1:57:00.556
Do as the soldier, Toto.
Go away from here.

1:57:01.849 --> 1:57:03.892
This land is cursed.

1:57:04.893 --> 1:57:10.024
Living here every day,
you think it's the centre of the world.

1:57:11.191 --> 1:57:14.945
That nothing will ever change.

1:57:15.070 --> 1:57:18.157
Then you leave, for a year or two.

1:57:19.199 --> 1:57:21.410
And when you return
everything's changed.

1:57:21.535 --> 1:57:23.412
The thread is broken.

1:57:24.538 --> 1:57:28.751
You don't find what you were looking for.
What was yours is gone.

1:57:30.210 --> 1:57:35.299
You need to go away for a long time,
for many years

1:57:35.424 --> 1:57:39.136
before you can come back
and find your people …

1:57:40.721 --> 1:57:43.474
the land where you were born.

1:57:44.308 --> 1:57:46.268
But not now. It's impossible.

1:57:47.227 --> 1:57:49.438
Now you're blinder than I am.

1:57:49.563 --> 1:57:53.275
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

1:57:54.318 --> 1:57:56.278
No, Toto.

1:57:57.988 --> 1:58:00.407
No one said it.

1:58:01.867 --> 1:58:03.744
This time, I'm saying it.

1:58:05.245 --> 1:58:09.208
Life is not what you see
in films.

1:58:09.333 --> 1:58:12.961
Life is much harder.

1:58:15.172 --> 1:58:17.132
Go away!

1:58:17.257 --> 1:58:20.636
Go back to Rome. You're young.

1:58:20.761 --> 1:58:22.554
The world's your oyster.

1:58:23.931 --> 1:58:25.557
I'm old.

1:58:26.850 --> 1:58:28.894
I don't want to hear you
any more.

1:58:29.978 --> 1:58:32.356
I want to hear about you.

2:00:04.865 --> 2:00:06.700
Don't come back.

2:00:07.951 --> 2:00:11.872
Don't think about us.
Don't look back, don't write.

2:00:13.081 --> 2:00:16.919
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget about us.

2:00:18.712 --> 2:00:22.090
If you come back,
don't come and see me.

2:00:22.216 --> 2:00:25.761
I won't let you in,
you understand?

2:00:32.976 --> 2:00:34.937
Thank you …

2:00:35.729 --> 2:00:37.898
for everything you've done.

2:00:40.651 --> 2:00:43.737
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

2:00:45.572 --> 2:00:47.991
The way you loved
the projection booth

2:00:49.534 --> 2:00:51.578
when you were a little boy.

2:01:00.462 --> 2:01:04.633
Is he already gone?
Toto, farewell!

2:01:11.348 --> 2:01:13.350
I'm too late, what a pity!

2:02:13.535 --> 2:02:16.163
It's Toto. I knew it.

2:02:48.236 --> 2:02:53.241
Your sister Lia will be so happy
to see you. And the children.

2:02:53.367 --> 2:02:56.578
You won't recognise them.

2:02:56.703 --> 2:02:58.747
When are they coming to Rome?

2:02:58.872 --> 2:03:01.583
See how nice the house is?

2:03:01.708 --> 2:03:05.379
We've had it all redone,
thanks to you.

2:03:05.504 --> 2:03:09.132
Come, I've a surprise for you.

2:03:11.009 --> 2:03:13.303
Are you tired?

2:03:13.428 --> 2:03:16.348
You've time to rest
before the funeral.

2:03:16.473 --> 2:03:19.101
No, Mum.
The flight is only an hour.

2:03:20.394 --> 2:03:24.064
Don't say that,
after all these years.

2:03:24.189 --> 2:03:27.859
Come, I've put all your things
in here.

2:05:15.717 --> 2:05:18.887
He must be glad you came, Toto.

2:05:20.722 --> 2:05:23.850
He always talked about you,
always.

2:05:25.310 --> 2:05:27.020
Right up to the end.

2:05:33.235 --> 2:05:35.487
He really loved you.

2:05:49.167 --> 2:05:51.419
He left something for you.

2:05:52.879 --> 2:05:55.131
Before you leave

2:05:55.257 --> 2:05:57.050
come and see me.

2:07:42.489 --> 2:07:45.283
When did you close it down?

2:07:45.408 --> 2:07:48.703
Six years ago in May.
No one ever came.

2:07:49.954 --> 2:07:54.918
You know it better than I do.
The recession, TV, videos …

2:07:55.752 --> 2:07:58.630
The cinema has become a memory.

2:08:00.173 --> 2:08:04.386
The city has purchased the site
for a public car park.

2:08:04.511 --> 2:08:08.390
They're pulling down on Saturday,
Signor di Vita. Pity!

2:08:10.392 --> 2:08:12.102
Why "Signor di Vita?"

2:08:13.561 --> 2:08:15.480
It didn't use to be like that.

2:08:15.605 --> 2:08:20.360
It's awkward to be casual
with an important person.

2:08:20.485 --> 2:08:24.030
However, if you insist … Toto.

2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:28.743
Excuse me.

2:08:34.082 --> 2:08:36.751
Who would have believed it?
Toto.

2:09:09.909 --> 2:09:13.621
Uncle, next time grandma goes
to Rome, I'll go with her.

2:09:13.747 --> 2:09:16.166
I want to see where you work.

2:09:16.291 --> 2:09:19.294
OK, but there's not much to see.

2:09:19.419 --> 2:09:22.088
My job is much ado about nothing.

2:09:24.257 --> 2:09:27.886
Careful, Salvatore.

2:09:28.011 --> 2:09:31.181
They're worse than cannibals,
they'll take advantage of you.

2:09:33.933 --> 2:09:35.268
Are you off tomorrow?

2:09:39.564 --> 2:09:43.067
I don't know.
I really don't know, Filippo.

2:10:03.671 --> 2:10:05.089
Must be for you.

2:10:05.715 --> 2:10:10.261
They've been ringing all day
asking when you'll be back.

2:13:30.670 --> 2:13:32.588
Double whisky, please.

2:13:43.016 --> 2:13:48.271
Excuse me, aren't you Dr Lénera?
I'm a fan of yours.

2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:55.445
Thank you.

2:15:10.478 --> 2:15:13.689
I'm so sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

2:16:35.855 --> 2:16:37.648
It's always me ringing.

2:16:37.773 --> 2:16:41.611
I asked you to pick me up
at lunchtime.

2:16:41.736 --> 2:16:44.655
Forget it, I'm not going.

2:16:44.780 --> 2:16:47.575
In fact, I'll go on my own.

2:17:35.081 --> 2:17:37.333
What are you thinking, Toto?

2:17:40.795 --> 2:17:44.840
We've never really talked, Mum.

2:17:48.469 --> 2:17:51.681
When I was little, I saw you …

2:17:53.474 --> 2:17:55.476
as an old woman already.

2:17:56.852 --> 2:17:59.105
Maybe all kids are like that,
who knows?

2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:11.409
It's taken me all this time …

2:18:13.286 --> 2:18:17.415
to realise that you were young then,
and beautiful.

2:18:19.125 --> 2:18:21.377
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

2:18:23.379 --> 2:18:27.758
Why, then?
Why did you stay on your own?

2:18:28.843 --> 2:18:31.137
Without anyone to look after you.

2:18:32.805 --> 2:18:36.517
You could have remarried.
Why didn't you?

2:18:39.895 --> 2:18:42.565
I might not have understood
at the time.

2:18:44.025 --> 2:18:46.485
But later … yes.

2:18:48.279 --> 2:18:51.240
There was never anyone, if that's
what you're thinking.

2:18:52.325 --> 2:18:54.452
I didn't want to.

2:18:54.577 --> 2:18:57.747
I remained faithful,
first to your father

2:18:57.872 --> 2:19:00.958
and then to you and Lia.

2:19:01.083 --> 2:19:04.754
It's the way I am, what can I do?

2:19:04.879 --> 2:19:06.756
And you're like me.

2:19:08.007 --> 2:19:11.385
You're too attached to the past.

2:19:11.510 --> 2:19:14.889
I'm not sure it's a good thing.

2:19:15.014 --> 2:19:19.018
Being faithful has its drawbacks.

2:19:19.143 --> 2:19:22.104
Fidelity brings loneliness.

2:19:29.695 --> 2:19:31.364
I shouldn't have called you.

2:19:33.741 --> 2:19:36.035
It's not your fault, Mum.

2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:38.454
I've always been afraid
to come back.

2:19:42.166 --> 2:19:44.502
Now, after all these years …

2:19:45.711 --> 2:19:50.132
I thought I was stronger
and had forgotten many things.

2:19:52.176 --> 2:19:56.889
But it's all right there
in front of me …

2:19:58.140 --> 2:20:00.184
as if I'd never gone away.

2:20:02.436 --> 2:20:05.272
And yet, I hardly know Lia.

2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:11.320
And you, Mum …

2:20:12.571 --> 2:20:14.573
I deserted you.

2:20:15.783 --> 2:20:17.827
I ran away like a criminal.

2:20:17.952 --> 2:20:19.829
Without an explanation.

2:20:19.954 --> 2:20:24.125
I never asked for one.
You don't have to explain.

2:20:24.250 --> 2:20:27.795
I always thought you were doing
the right thing.

2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:30.214
Don't dwell on it.

2:20:30.339 --> 2:20:32.842
Only one thing bothered me.

2:20:32.967 --> 2:20:37.638
At night, before I went to bed,

2:20:37.763 --> 2:20:39.265
I'd lock the door.

2:20:40.933 --> 2:20:43.269
- You never used to.
- I know.

2:20:44.770 --> 2:20:48.315
When you worked in the cinema,
late at night,

2:20:48.441 --> 2:20:53.487
I could never sleep
till you got home.

2:20:54.905 --> 2:20:57.908
Then, when you got back,

2:20:58.033 --> 2:21:00.786
I pretended to be asleep.

2:21:00.911 --> 2:21:03.456
But I was aware
of all your movements.

2:21:03.581 --> 2:21:08.085
Then, when you were asleep,
I'd get up

2:21:08.210 --> 2:21:10.838
and lock the door.

2:21:12.756 --> 2:21:16.427
After you'd gone …

2:21:17.261 --> 2:21:19.805
whenever I did that

2:21:19.930 --> 2:21:23.267
I felt as though I was
locking someone out.

2:21:24.768 --> 2:21:26.604
Shutting him off.

2:21:27.855 --> 2:21:30.191
You were right to leave.

2:21:30.316 --> 2:21:32.860
It allowed you to do
what you wanted.

2:21:35.279 --> 2:21:39.742
When I phone you,
it's a different woman every time.

2:21:39.867 --> 2:21:42.495
I pretend that I know them

2:21:42.620 --> 2:21:47.041
to avoid embarrassing introductions.

2:21:47.166 --> 2:21:51.212
I bet they take me
for a dotty old woman.

2:21:53.672 --> 2:21:59.512
But I haven't yet heard the voice
of someone who really loves you.

2:21:59.637 --> 2:22:02.515
I can tell, you know.

2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:07.686
All the same,
I'd like to see you settling down.

2:22:08.646 --> 2:22:10.356
In love with someone.

2:22:11.941 --> 2:22:14.318
But your life is there.

2:22:14.443 --> 2:22:16.487
Here, there are only ghosts.

2:22:17.446 --> 2:22:18.906
Let go, Toto.

2:23:23.095 --> 2:23:24.805
Boccia!

2:23:31.770 --> 2:23:33.689
His name was Lo Meo.

2:24:33.499 --> 2:24:35.668
<i>Hello! Who is it?</i>

2:24:39.171 --> 2:24:42.591
- May I speak to Signora Elena?
<i>- Speaking.</i>

2:24:44.468 --> 2:24:46.136
<i>Who is it?</i>

2:24:48.222 --> 2:24:49.848
Salvatore.

2:24:57.064 --> 2:24:58.565
<i>Who?</i>

2:25:00.234 --> 2:25:03.779
Di Vita. I'm Salvatore di Vita.

2:25:06.532 --> 2:25:08.701
Remember me?

2:25:09.201 --> 2:25:14.206
I'm ringing from the bar
across the road, Elena.

2:25:26.427 --> 2:25:28.554
<i>Of course I remember you.</i>

2:25:32.599 --> 2:25:36.562
I'd like to see you, Elena.
Let's meet.

2:25:38.439 --> 2:25:40.190
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

2:25:41.108 --> 2:25:43.110
<i>Why should we meet?</i>

2:25:44.403 --> 2:25:46.321
<i>What good would it do?</i>

2:25:47.114 --> 2:25:48.907
Please, don't say no.

2:25:50.117 --> 2:25:54.121
<i>I'm old, Salvatore.
And so are you.</i>

2:25:54.246 --> 2:25:56.081
<i>It's best not to see each other.</i>

2:28:07.838 --> 2:28:09.423
How did you know I'd be here?

2:28:11.466 --> 2:28:15.178
It's been a long time, but I haven't
forgotten certain things.

2:28:16.597 --> 2:28:19.433
There aren't many places
you'd go to.

2:28:22.311 --> 2:28:23.896
I did the rounds.

2:28:42.915 --> 2:28:44.666
You're still beautiful.

2:28:48.712 --> 2:28:52.215
What are you saying? I'm old.

2:28:57.346 --> 2:28:59.348
Don't look at me like that.

2:29:03.435 --> 2:29:05.270
Why have you come back?

2:29:07.147 --> 2:29:11.109
Alfredo's dead.
Remember him?

2:29:12.778 --> 2:29:16.782
Of course I remember him.
I'm sorry.

2:29:20.077 --> 2:29:21.954
You were very fond of him.

2:29:24.790 --> 2:29:26.416
I saw your daughter.

2:29:27.751 --> 2:29:29.461
She's very beautiful.

2:29:32.005 --> 2:29:34.174
God knows how many Salvatores
she's got in tow.

2:29:36.468 --> 2:29:38.095
A few.

2:29:39.554 --> 2:29:42.474
But there are not many Salvatores.

2:29:46.395 --> 2:29:49.523
I've a son, too. He's older.

2:29:52.484 --> 2:29:53.527
And you?

2:29:53.652 --> 2:29:56.488
No children. I never married.

2:30:01.201 --> 2:30:02.911
You happy?

2:30:03.036 --> 2:30:04.913
I am, all things considered.

2:30:07.249 --> 2:30:09.751
Though it's not what I dreamt of.

2:30:13.338 --> 2:30:15.590
You know my husband, don't you?

2:30:18.677 --> 2:30:21.096
Boccia, I remember him well.

2:30:23.348 --> 2:30:26.768
What does he do?
What's his job?

2:30:28.353 --> 2:30:32.733
He's a politician.
A local councillor.

2:30:35.485 --> 2:30:38.196
We met again at Pisa University.

2:30:41.241 --> 2:30:44.411
How come you didn't marry
your father's …?

2:30:44.536 --> 2:30:48.165
I didn't want to.
I got my own way in the end.

2:30:54.087 --> 2:30:56.882
I was still waiting for you
at the time.

2:31:02.846 --> 2:31:06.808
I never forgot you.
Never.

2:31:07.350 --> 2:31:09.019
Neither did I.

2:31:11.063 --> 2:31:13.356
Even though you'd disappeared.

2:31:17.944 --> 2:31:19.988
But why talk about it now?

2:31:26.161 --> 2:31:31.792
It's pathetic, and absurd.
You still live in Rome?

2:31:31.917 --> 2:31:33.877
What are you saying?

2:31:34.628 --> 2:31:37.964
We'd arranged to meet
at the Paradiso.

2:31:38.090 --> 2:31:42.177
But you never showed up.
Not a word, nothing.

2:31:42.969 --> 2:31:45.972
How long ago was it?
Over 30 years.

2:31:50.936 --> 2:31:52.854
But I …

2:31:52.979 --> 2:31:55.107
I did show up.

2:32:03.949 --> 2:32:05.992
But I was late.

2:32:08.036 --> 2:32:10.622
I'd quarrelled with my parents.

2:32:13.125 --> 2:32:17.129
Trying to convince them
not to come between us.

2:32:18.964 --> 2:32:21.049
But it was no use.

2:32:23.468 --> 2:32:29.516
They'd made up their minds
to leave Sicily once and for all.

2:32:31.852 --> 2:32:33.895
And that's what we did.

2:32:35.313 --> 2:32:38.984
I didn't know what do,
what to say.

2:32:41.319 --> 2:32:46.116
So I agreed to do what
they wanted.

2:32:48.910 --> 2:32:54.207
But I convinced my father to let me
see you one last time.

2:32:56.168 --> 2:32:58.003
I was hoping …

2:32:59.171 --> 2:33:04.092
we'd take a decision
when we met.

2:33:05.927 --> 2:33:08.013
I thought maybe …

2:33:09.848 --> 2:33:11.975
we'd run away together.

2:33:18.231 --> 2:33:23.445
My father took me to the cinema.
But Alfredo was there, not you.

2:33:26.740 --> 2:33:30.243
And I couldn't wait
for you to come back.

2:33:32.954 --> 2:33:34.456
Hurry up, Elena.

2:33:34.581 --> 2:33:37.792
I told Alfredo what was happening.

2:33:37.918 --> 2:33:42.464
I said we were going away
and asked him to let you know.

2:33:45.717 --> 2:33:47.594
He was very nice to me.

2:33:48.678 --> 2:33:52.265
He listened to me patiently.

2:33:54.601 --> 2:33:58.355
Calm down, don't get upset.

2:34:00.190 --> 2:34:02.776
Listen to what I have to say.

2:34:02.901 --> 2:34:07.072
If you want me to tell Toto,
I will.

2:34:08.031 --> 2:34:12.577
But if you want my advice,
let it be.

2:34:12.702 --> 2:34:15.163
It's best for you two
to stay apart.

2:34:16.665 --> 2:34:18.416
My dear child …

2:34:20.335 --> 2:34:23.129
Out of the fire of love
come ashes.

2:34:23.255 --> 2:34:27.008
Even the greatest love
eventually fizzles out.

2:34:27.133 --> 2:34:31.554
You'll meet other people,
plenty of them.

2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:34.474
But there's only one future
for Toto.

2:34:35.100 --> 2:34:39.521
He doesn't know it yet,
and wouldn't believe me if I told him.

2:34:39.646 --> 2:34:42.023
He'd kill me if I did.

2:34:43.817 --> 2:34:47.988
But you, my dear …
you can understand.

2:34:48.113 --> 2:34:51.741
You must understand.
Do it for him.

2:35:10.510 --> 2:35:14.055
I never wanted anyone to know
my secret, not even you.

2:35:21.980 --> 2:35:23.815
Bloody Alfredo!

2:35:26.609 --> 2:35:28.737
He charmed everyone, even you.

2:35:31.072 --> 2:35:33.700
I said I'd follow his advice.

2:35:33.825 --> 2:35:36.411
But I left a note for you
before I left.

2:35:48.340 --> 2:35:50.175
I was on my way down.

2:35:52.344 --> 2:35:55.347
I knew Alfredo couldn't see me.

2:35:57.432 --> 2:35:59.309
So I went back up.

2:36:01.811 --> 2:36:05.523
I saw him sitting there,
by the projector.

2:36:07.484 --> 2:36:10.195
I took one of those bits of paper
on the wall.

2:36:12.405 --> 2:36:14.866
And wrote a note saying
where to find me.

2:36:17.535 --> 2:36:19.537
And that I'd wait for you.

2:36:23.958 --> 2:36:26.336
But you disappeared all the same.

2:36:37.138 --> 2:36:39.766
If you knew how I searched
for you.

2:36:42.477 --> 2:36:44.229
You can't imagine.

2:36:45.897 --> 2:36:48.191
I wrote, I phoned … nothing.

2:36:50.777 --> 2:36:52.654
No one ever replied.

2:36:57.158 --> 2:36:59.077
That's why I left …

2:37:03.248 --> 2:37:05.750
and never came back.

2:37:08.128 --> 2:37:10.171
But for years I dreamt of you.

2:37:22.350 --> 2:37:24.727
Time went by.

2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:30.859
Yet I looked for you in
every woman I ever met.

2:37:32.652 --> 2:37:36.990
I was lucky in my career.
Very lucky, it's true.

2:37:40.952 --> 2:37:43.621
But something was missing.

2:37:46.749 --> 2:37:53.006
I could never have imagined
it would be the fault

2:37:53.131 --> 2:37:55.758
of the man who was like
a father to me.

2:37:57.594 --> 2:37:59.345
A mad man!

2:38:00.054 --> 2:38:03.433
He wasn't mad.
I hated him at first.

2:38:04.559 --> 2:38:06.352
But as time went by …

2:38:07.854 --> 2:38:09.731
I understood his advice.

2:38:11.941 --> 2:38:14.319
And I understood your silence.

2:38:15.987 --> 2:38:18.239
But I never found that note.

2:38:20.783 --> 2:38:22.994
I covered it with my own hands.

2:38:24.954 --> 2:38:28.583
I didn't see it,
there's no other explanation.

2:38:28.708 --> 2:38:31.669
No point explaining any more.

2:38:33.254 --> 2:38:35.006
That's how it was.

2:38:36.424 --> 2:38:38.801
But Alfredo didn't betray you.

2:38:38.927 --> 2:38:41.387
He knew you better than anyone.

2:38:45.433 --> 2:38:48.144
If you'd chosen to stay with me,
you'd never have made any films.

2:38:48.269 --> 2:38:50.355
And that would have been
a great pity.

2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:54.400
They're such beautiful films.
I've seen them all.

2:38:57.654 --> 2:39:00.323
But you shouldn't have
changed your name.

2:39:01.908 --> 2:39:03.743
What's wrong with your name?

2:40:19.068 --> 2:40:21.613
He left this for you.

2:40:36.711 --> 2:40:43.301
When they showed your films
on television, he was happy.

2:40:45.386 --> 2:40:49.766
He just sat in front of the TV
and forgot all his ailments.

2:40:52.727 --> 2:40:56.314
He knew every single word
by heart.

2:40:56.439 --> 2:41:00.193
And I told him what
the images were.

2:41:00.318 --> 2:41:05.865
And when you were in the papers,
he'd make me read it again and again.

2:41:10.662 --> 2:41:12.246
He never asked to see me?

2:41:12.372 --> 2:41:15.249
No. Never.

2:41:16.876 --> 2:41:18.878
Your mother once said

2:41:19.837 --> 2:41:23.132
you'd come if he wanted you to.

2:41:24.759 --> 2:41:27.428
He was furious. He said,

2:41:27.553 --> 2:41:32.016
"No. Toto must never
return to Giancaldo."

2:41:34.936 --> 2:41:37.522
He wasn't being mean.

2:41:37.647 --> 2:41:39.357
He was a good man.

2:41:40.817 --> 2:41:43.444
Who knows what went through
his head?

2:41:44.987 --> 2:41:49.075
He started saying strange things
towards the end.

2:41:51.828 --> 2:41:54.622
Just before he closed his eyes …

2:41:55.873 --> 2:41:59.711
he told your mother
not to let you know.

2:42:13.975 --> 2:42:18.938
1977, 1976, 1968 …

2:42:43.337 --> 2:42:45.173
Moby Dick.

2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:49.927
Dreams in a Drawer.

2:42:50.762 --> 2:42:52.430
The Challenge.

2:42:53.264 --> 2:42:55.266
The Searchers.

2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:00.980
Magnificent Obsession.

2:43:03.441 --> 2:43:05.359
Il Grido.

2:43:17.622 --> 2:43:21.751
"Forgive me, Salvatore.

2:43:24.212 --> 2:43:26.672
"One day I'll tell you
what happened.

2:43:27.673 --> 2:43:30.802
"I'm so sorry I couldn't see you.

2:43:30.927 --> 2:43:34.764
"Unfortunately, I'm leaving
with my mother tonight.

2:43:35.848 --> 2:43:39.393
"We're moving to Tuscany.

2:43:41.145 --> 2:43:44.357
"But I love only you.

2:43:45.107 --> 2:43:48.277
"I'll never love anyone else,
I swear.

2:43:50.404 --> 2:43:55.076
"I'm giving you the address
of a friend for you to write.

2:43:57.328 --> 2:43:59.163
"Don't ever leave me.

2:44:02.083 --> 2:44:04.502
"I love you.

2:44:05.795 --> 2:44:07.755
"Elena"

2:44:11.801 --> 2:44:12.927
<i>When do you leave?</i>

2:44:15.346 --> 2:44:17.223
This afternoon.

2:44:18.558 --> 2:44:22.311
Elena, maybe in future we can …

2:44:22.436 --> 2:44:27.233
There is no future, Salvatore.
Only the past.

2:44:29.151 --> 2:44:32.238
Even what happened yesterday
is only a dream.

2:44:32.363 --> 2:44:34.073
A marvellous dream.

2:44:36.701 --> 2:44:38.828
We never did it when we were young.

2:44:40.413 --> 2:44:41.581
Remember?

2:44:44.709 --> 2:44:47.920
<i>I couldn't have hoped for
a better ending.</i>

2:44:55.094 --> 2:44:57.305
I'll never agree with you.

2:44:58.890 --> 2:45:00.766
Never, Elena.

2:46:43.744 --> 2:46:46.247
The square is mine!

2:47:11.981 --> 2:47:14.817
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

2:47:14.942 --> 2:47:18.529
OK. Congratulations,
I loved your film.

2:47:20.197 --> 2:47:23.743
- Well?
- The film's being distributed.

2:47:23.868 --> 2:47:28.622
There'll be a press conference
with the actors, producer …

2:47:28.748 --> 2:47:33.919
The prize has just been announced and
the telegrams are already mounting.

2:47:34.587 --> 2:47:37.298
Aren't you happy?

2:47:37.423 --> 2:47:40.009
Yes, of course. We'll talk later.

2:51:00.709 --> 2:51:05.005
THE END
