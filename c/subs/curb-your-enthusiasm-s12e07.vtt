WEBVTT

00:13.719 --> 00:16.759
Huh?

00:26.801 --> 00:27.732
Hello?

00:27.732 --> 00:30.069
<i>Larry,
it's Gina Grossbard.</i>

00:30.069 --> 00:32.838
<i>- Stu had a stroke.</i>
- Who?

00:32.838 --> 00:34.410
<i>Stu Grossbard.</i>

00:35.477 --> 00:36.645
<i>From the club.</i>

00:37.579 --> 00:38.377
What?

00:38.377 --> 00:40.112
<i>I thought
you'd want to know.</i>

00:44.352 --> 00:46.189
Why the fuck'd she call me?

00:49.690 --> 00:51.791
<i>Yeah, it's like at three o'clock
in the morning.</i>

00:51.791 --> 00:53.292
I don't even know
the guy hardly.

00:53.292 --> 00:55.294
- It's ridiculous.
- So crazy. It's nuts.

00:55.294 --> 00:58.865
What am I doing on that list
of middle-of-the-night calls?

00:58.865 --> 00:59.965
I don't understand it.

00:59.965 --> 01:02.501
Better you than me.
That's insane.

01:02.501 --> 01:03.835
- The worst part?
- Yeah?

01:03.835 --> 01:07.306
Now I'm on a text chain
with his wife and the family.

01:07.306 --> 01:08.574
Those chains. I've been on 'em.

01:08.574 --> 01:10.370
They're the worst thing ever.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.744
Wait a second. I bet this
is another one. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:12.744 --> 01:15.014
- The chain? That's crazy.
- It's--
It's the chain.

01:15.014 --> 01:16.348
"Hope you're feeling
better today.

01:16.348 --> 01:19.018
My niece just drew this
for Stu."

01:19.018 --> 01:20.219
- Yeah.
- Look.

01:20.219 --> 01:21.720
Look. Look at the picture.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.823
You gotta heart that.
Just heart it.

01:23.823 --> 01:25.657
Oh, another one. Holy cow.

01:25.657 --> 01:27.226
- It's a nuisance.
- It's never gonna stop.

01:27.226 --> 01:29.562
And I can't just
drop out, they'll see I left.

01:29.562 --> 01:30.729
Listen to this.

01:30.729 --> 01:33.332
"My family and I are here
whenever anyone needs anything.

01:33.332 --> 01:35.935
Martha's beef stew
is absolute perfection

01:35.935 --> 01:37.669
and really heals all wounds."

01:37.669 --> 01:40.439
It's really, honestly,
like, the lowest form
of human communication.

01:40.439 --> 01:42.241
Hey, guess what?
I got a date tonight.

01:42.241 --> 01:44.010
- Wow.
- With an artist.

01:44.010 --> 01:45.578
- Really?
- Yeah. She's painting me

01:45.578 --> 01:47.681
as part of a series
of old Jewish comedians

01:47.681 --> 01:48.914
called <i>Wisenheimers.</i>

01:48.914 --> 01:50.983
- I think Richard sat for that.
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

01:50.983 --> 01:53.152
Yeah, he said she was cute.
He asked her out, but he said
it didn't go anywhere.

01:53.152 --> 01:55.421
Oh, well, you know.

01:55.421 --> 01:57.423
- Maybe he should've...
- Some of us have it.

01:57.423 --> 01:59.658
...gone to Atlanta
and given some water to someone

01:59.658 --> 02:03.062
- in the voting line, maybe. Huh?
- Perhaps he should've
given some water.

02:03.062 --> 02:05.430
Dig this.

02:05.430 --> 02:08.935
Susie has got
a textile convention

02:08.935 --> 02:10.236
in North Carolina,

02:10.236 --> 02:12.972
- and she wants me
to go with her.
- What?

02:12.972 --> 02:14.774
Yep.
What's a textile convention?

02:14.774 --> 02:16.242
You're not going to that.
That's ridiculous.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.642
- No, she already bought tickets.
- What?

02:17.642 --> 02:19.678
And dig this.
Because it's last minute,

02:19.678 --> 02:22.014
- middle fucking seats.
- Oh, you can't go.

02:22.014 --> 02:23.182
How am I gonna get out?

02:23.182 --> 02:24.820
- Guys, can I do this here?
- Oh, so sorry.

02:27.884 --> 02:29.789
- Ugh. The whole day.
- Eh.

02:29.789 --> 02:31.457
- You're not having
the greatest game.
- No.

02:31.457 --> 02:34.197
- All right, I'm gonna
give you that. Pick it up.
- No cigar.

02:34.796 --> 02:35.762
She's insane.

02:35.762 --> 02:37.934
No, you gotta
get out of that thing.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.300
What? What the hell?

02:41.300 --> 02:42.434
- The fuck's he doing?
- What?

02:42.434 --> 02:43.936
- Are you drinking?
- What is that?

02:43.936 --> 02:45.037
Just a little swing juice.

02:45.037 --> 02:46.605
- Swing juice?
- Yeah.

02:46.605 --> 02:49.008
- What's in it?
- I go with iced tea
and a little bit of just vodka.

02:49.008 --> 02:50.609
You look like a derelict
with that thing.

02:50.609 --> 02:53.012
You mean a gentleman.
Here's looking up your address.

02:53.012 --> 02:54.780
That's bizarre.

02:54.780 --> 02:56.143
Hey, you know what?

02:56.143 --> 02:58.183
I think I got a way
to get out of this trip for you.

02:58.183 --> 03:00.285
- How? Yeah.
- You have this dream, okay?

03:00.285 --> 03:02.554
And it's like a nightmare
about the plane.

03:02.554 --> 03:04.290
And in the dream,
you're thinking,

03:04.290 --> 03:05.624
"Oh, I'm on a-- the middle seat.

03:05.624 --> 03:07.927
Can't breathe.
It's too tight. No room."

03:07.927 --> 03:08.862
She'll wake up,

03:08.862 --> 03:10.195
and you'll tell her
what the dream's about,

03:10.195 --> 03:11.630
and she'll be
very concerned about you,

03:11.630 --> 03:13.299
and she'll say,
"Eh, okay, don't go."

03:13.299 --> 03:14.800
- I like it. That's good.
- Huh? Is that good?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.997
- That's pretty great. Yeah.
- It's a dream scheme. Let--

03:16.997 --> 03:19.708
- Let's see you do it.
- All right. Uh...

03:26.379 --> 03:29.181
Middle seat! Can't breathe.
Oh, they're squeezing me!

03:29.181 --> 03:30.382
Wake up! Wake up!

03:30.382 --> 03:31.517
Wake up!

03:31.517 --> 03:33.586
- Jeffrey, wake up! Wake up!
- What? What? Oh.

03:33.586 --> 03:35.588
You were having a bad dream.
What's going on?

03:35.588 --> 03:38.190
I was having
a panic attack. I...

03:38.190 --> 03:41.561
You're not going on the trip.
I'm gonna go. You stay home.

03:41.561 --> 03:43.123
- Do you like that?
- I love it.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.464
- It's worth a shot.
- It's worth a shot.

03:45.464 --> 03:47.366
All right.
Pretty good so far, huh?

03:47.366 --> 03:49.368
- So far.
- You wanna be on my talk show?

03:49.368 --> 03:51.438
- Of course.
- All right, we're back.

03:52.471 --> 03:55.408
Our next guest is a young artist
from Los Angeles.

03:55.408 --> 03:57.037
Her name's Renee Holcomb.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.778
Please give her
a nice round of applause.

03:58.778 --> 03:59.979
Yeah.

03:59.979 --> 04:01.713
- Renee, welcome.
- Thank you.

04:01.713 --> 04:04.283
I understand you have
an art show coming up soon.

04:04.283 --> 04:06.586
I do.
It's my <i>Wisenheimer</i> series.

04:06.586 --> 04:08.453
Now, did you paint Larry David?

04:08.453 --> 04:09.755
I did. I did.

04:09.755 --> 04:12.258
I heard he's just
an incredible person.

04:12.258 --> 04:13.492
And an incredible face.

04:13.492 --> 04:17.363
You know? It's Picasso-esque.
You know, a little asymmetrical.

04:17.363 --> 04:20.432
- Asymmetrical?
- Well, you know, just slightly.

04:20.432 --> 04:23.202
All right. Thank you
for being on our show tonight.

04:23.202 --> 04:24.603
And our next guest...

04:24.603 --> 04:29.042
Okay, I've got the key lime pie
and the herbal tea.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.109
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

04:30.109 --> 04:31.572
Well, thanks
for being on my show.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.848
It's a pleasure.

04:33.849 --> 04:34.850
Mm.

04:38.019 --> 04:39.622
- Mm. Hold on.
- No good?

04:42.256 --> 04:44.460
- Oh, God. Mm. Mm-mm.
- Let me taste it.

04:46.795 --> 04:47.594
What do you think?

04:47.594 --> 04:49.828
- Ugh! Ugh!
- Yeah. Right?

04:49.828 --> 04:52.631
- Oh, it's disgusting. Excuse me.
- It's terrible. Tart.

04:52.631 --> 04:55.368
- Hi. Yeah.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

04:55.368 --> 04:57.336
- This pie.
- You don't like it?

04:57.336 --> 04:58.904
- It's really awful. Yeah.
- Oh. It really--

04:58.904 --> 05:01.340
- Inedible. Really.
- It looked like
you were both enjoying it.

05:01.340 --> 05:03.308
The grimace looked like
we were enjoying it?

05:03.308 --> 05:04.510
I'm gonna get this
off the bill for you.

05:04.510 --> 05:05.912
- Thank you.
- Perfect. Thank you.

05:05.912 --> 05:07.146
Everything else has been lovely.

05:07.146 --> 05:08.513
Looked like we were enjoying it?

05:08.513 --> 05:11.083
I'll show you what it looks like
when I enjoy something.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.848
What do you wanna do
after this, by the way?

05:13.848 --> 05:14.849
- Hi, there.
- Oh.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.050
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.556
- This is yours, correct?
- It is.

05:17.556 --> 05:20.092
Well, unfortunately,
a little bad news.

05:20.092 --> 05:21.427
I'm not gonna be able
to take this

05:21.427 --> 05:23.730
- off of your bill tonight.
- Why?

05:23.730 --> 05:24.796
It's halfway gone.

05:24.796 --> 05:26.666
- You guys ate a lot of pie.
- Is this a joke?

05:26.666 --> 05:28.267
It's not a joke. What you ate

05:28.267 --> 05:30.436
went past the threshold
of returnability.

05:30.436 --> 05:33.272
Okay,
I took a robust bite initially

05:33.272 --> 05:34.673
because it's dessert.

05:34.673 --> 05:37.576
Then I took a tentative bite
to confirm that it was gross,

05:37.576 --> 05:38.978
- and then he took a bite.
- Three bites.

05:38.978 --> 05:42.114
She took one bite.
She said, "This tastes awful."

05:42.114 --> 05:44.383
A second bite,
"Yes, it is awful."

05:44.383 --> 05:46.452
And you take a large bite
at that point?

05:46.452 --> 05:47.886
That's the part
that doesn't make sense.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.522
You have to take a large bite.
How else do you confirm?

05:50.522 --> 05:52.291
You can't confirm
on a small bite.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.558
- Right.
- You don't get enough taste.

05:53.558 --> 05:56.262
- That's three huge bites.
- You know what?

05:56.262 --> 05:58.064
- Charge me double for it.
- I don't need to.

05:58.064 --> 05:59.359
She's an artist.
She's a libertine.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.295
We're going back to my house.
We're gonna have sex.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.969
We're gonna forget
about this horrible experience.

06:02.969 --> 06:03.903
- Exactly.
- Okay?

06:03.903 --> 06:05.337
- We're gonna have great sex.
- So there. Yeah.

06:05.337 --> 06:07.173
- You two are gonna have sex?
- Yes.

06:07.173 --> 06:08.407
Yeah, you got a problem
with that?

06:08.407 --> 06:11.210
- No. No problem.
- Let me ask you a question.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.447
- Who made this pie?
- Chef made the pie.

06:13.447 --> 06:14.681
- No wonder.
- No wonder?

06:14.681 --> 06:16.148
- No wonder.
- Hmm.

06:16.148 --> 06:17.216
Would you like me
to go grab Chef,

06:17.216 --> 06:18.451
and you can give him
your thoughts?

06:18.451 --> 06:19.986
Yeah, go get Chef.
You think I'm afraid of Chef?

06:19.986 --> 06:21.787
I don't know if you are,
but I think you should be.

06:21.787 --> 06:25.156
- Oh. Oh, I'm so scared of Chef.
- Yeah, get Chef. We don't care.

06:25.156 --> 06:27.459
I think when you meet Chef,
you're gonna change your tune
a little bit.

06:27.459 --> 06:29.095
- Oh, you think so?
You think so?
- Yeah.

06:29.095 --> 06:30.662
Go get Chef. Go get Chef.

06:30.662 --> 06:31.764
You're gonna regret
this choice.

06:31.764 --> 06:33.332
I'm the nice one
of the two of us.

06:33.332 --> 06:35.201
Okay. Yeah, get-- Oh, get Chef.

06:35.201 --> 06:37.806
Let's get the fuck out of here.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.747
How'd you sleep?

06:45.513 --> 06:47.113
- Not good.
- Really?

06:47.113 --> 06:48.751
- Yeah.
- Why?

06:50.417 --> 06:52.652
- Oh, yeah. New person.
- Yeah.

06:52.652 --> 06:54.687
- Mm-hmm. It's weird.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:54.687 --> 06:57.390
Well, aside from the insomnia,

06:57.390 --> 06:59.893
- everything else was amazing.
- Really?

06:59.893 --> 07:01.860
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

07:01.860 --> 07:06.532
Are you suggesting an encore?

07:06.532 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right there. Right there.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.435
- Yes!
- Huh? Oh. Huh? Huh?

07:10.435 --> 07:11.971
Huh?
Uh-huh.

07:13.505 --> 07:16.442
What?

07:16.442 --> 07:17.644
No, no.

07:22.614 --> 07:24.650
- What the hell?
- Larry, who the fuck is that?

07:24.650 --> 07:26.485
- It's the housekeeper!
- Why didn't she knock?

07:26.485 --> 07:27.886
She's not supposed to be here!
It's her day off!

07:27.886 --> 07:29.688
- She should've knocked.
- She should've knocked!

07:29.688 --> 07:32.125
You knock! You knock!
Hey, you always knock!

07:32.125 --> 07:33.692
You always knock. It's true.

07:33.692 --> 07:35.827
- Ah, she seems freaked out.
- Oh, yeah?

07:35.827 --> 07:38.530
- What gave you that impression?
- I mean, I don't get it.

07:38.530 --> 07:39.899
It's not like you don't have
one of your own. It's--

07:39.899 --> 07:41.768
- Think I better go talk to her.
- I'm gonna get dressed.

07:41.768 --> 07:43.068
Call me later.
Let me know how it goes.

07:43.068 --> 07:46.272
Oh, I can't wait for this.

07:46.272 --> 07:47.740
It was great, until it wasn't.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.141
If I don't see you, goodbye.

07:49.141 --> 07:51.276
Goodbye, Larry.

08:00.254 --> 08:02.956
Hey. Um...

08:02.956 --> 08:06.562
I thought--
I thought it was your day off.

08:07.061 --> 08:08.795
No, it wasn't.

08:08.795 --> 08:14.494
Anyway, uh, I--
I know what you saw, and, uh...

08:14.494 --> 08:18.137
You know, I don't know
the nature of your experiences,

08:18.137 --> 08:22.274
but, uh, a lot of women seem
to find pleasure in that.

08:22.274 --> 08:24.577
You know, go figure.

08:24.577 --> 08:26.512
I don't know.
I didn't wanna do it.

08:26.512 --> 08:29.509
I-- She asked me.
Oh, she practically begged me.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.117
"Oh, I want-- I like this,
I like this, I like this,

08:32.117 --> 08:34.220
I like this, I like this."
What am I supposed to do?

08:34.220 --> 08:36.422
I didn't wanna be rude.
You know, I'm a gentleman.

08:36.422 --> 08:37.990
It's a chivalrous thing to do.

08:37.990 --> 08:40.593
You know, it's like a gentleman
holds the door open for women,

08:40.593 --> 08:42.394
a gentleman puts
the toilet seat down,

08:42.394 --> 08:46.031
and a gentleman, eh...

08:49.335 --> 08:50.870
Whoo! Dahlia!

08:50.870 --> 08:52.939
What's going down, girl?

08:52.939 --> 08:54.538
Um, I gotta work.

08:55.211 --> 08:56.212
Bye.

08:56.978 --> 08:59.949
- What's wrong with her?
- Incident.

09:00.382 --> 09:01.617
Incident?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.516
Come out.

09:03.516 --> 09:06.318
- You got her pregnant?
- No. No.

09:06.318 --> 09:07.887
- It's not that.
- Give it to me.

09:07.887 --> 09:10.189
Well, Renee, the artist
I was telling you about.

09:10.189 --> 09:12.725
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, we were upstairs.

09:12.725 --> 09:16.195
Dahlia walked in on us
when I was downtown.

09:16.195 --> 09:19.331
- Oh. And yo ass--
- Yeah, she didn't take it well.

09:19.331 --> 09:20.834
What the fuck
you doing downtown?

09:20.834 --> 09:22.701
- You don't need to be downtown.
- Yeah.

09:22.701 --> 09:24.436
Downtown is fucking dangerous,
you understand?

09:24.436 --> 09:25.938
- Mm.
- You more of an uptown person.

09:25.938 --> 09:27.534
Don't get me wrong,
I love it uptown,

09:27.534 --> 09:30.476
but I will venture downtown,
you know, on occasion.

09:30.476 --> 09:32.077
What about you?
Are you a downtown guy?

09:32.077 --> 09:33.112
Yeah, I'm good.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.781
I can fuck around
and do a TED Talk to that shit.

09:34.781 --> 09:36.315
I'll have a pussy TED Talk.

09:36.315 --> 09:38.617
Get all the guys in one room,
get a little microphone,

09:38.617 --> 09:40.147
get a little laser pointer
and shit.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.987
Like, "This is a pussy. See?"

09:41.987 --> 09:44.523
Yeah, I'm good at that shit.

09:44.523 --> 09:45.825
I go through all
the fucking zones.

09:45.825 --> 09:47.426
- Uh-huh.
- All the eromenous zones.

09:47.426 --> 09:49.362
- Yeah. Erogenous.
- Eronenous zones.

09:49.362 --> 09:51.030
- Erogenous.
- Erotenous.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.032
- Erogenous zones, yeah.
- Erogenous zones.

09:53.032 --> 09:54.567
I know all the fucking zones
and shit.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.402
Gotta know where to lick at
and where to tickle.

09:56.402 --> 09:58.772
No caller ID.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.540
Hate that shit. Hey, do you.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.811
- Hello.
- <i>Larry, it's Gina.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:05.779
- Who?
- <i>Stu's wife.</i>

10:05.779 --> 10:08.381
<i>- He had a stroke.</i>
- Oh!

10:08.381 --> 10:10.319
Yeah, right, right.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.353
- How's he doing?
- <i>Not great, Larry.</i>

10:13.353 --> 10:14.520
<i>Touch and go.</i>

10:14.520 --> 10:17.088
<i>- I'd love to have lunch
with you tomorrow.</i>
- Lunch?

10:17.088 --> 10:19.759
<i>There's something very important
I need to talk to you about.</i>

10:19.759 --> 10:21.121
- Me?
- <i>Yes.</i>

10:21.121 --> 10:22.461
<i>Thank you so much, Larry.</i>

10:22.461 --> 10:26.265
<i>I'll send you the information.
You're on the text chain, right?</i>

10:26.265 --> 10:27.867
Oh, yeah, yeah, the text chain.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.535
<i>That text chain
is a blessing.</i>

10:29.535 --> 10:30.804
<i>I'm so glad you're on it.</i>

10:30.804 --> 10:32.366
Yeah, I read that quote

10:32.366 --> 10:34.173
about resilience
that your cousin sent.

10:34.173 --> 10:36.376
- It was very moving.
- <i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

10:36.376 --> 10:37.443
All right.

10:56.297 --> 11:01.067
Claustrophobic. The middle seat.
No room. No room!

11:01.067 --> 11:03.936
Ah! I can't breathe.
Middle seat! Can't breathe!

11:03.936 --> 11:06.138
Hey, Jeff. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

11:06.138 --> 11:08.540
Get me out of the middle!
Get me out!

11:08.540 --> 11:10.042
Jeff, wake up!

11:10.042 --> 11:12.679
Wake up!
You were having a nightmare.

11:12.679 --> 11:14.180
I think it was about the flight.

11:14.180 --> 11:16.015
You're really bent out of shape

11:16.015 --> 11:17.849
about this flying
to Raleigh, huh?

11:17.849 --> 11:20.419
- I guess I am. I--
- Yeah.
You know what, honey?

11:20.419 --> 11:21.987
If you're so worked up
about this

11:21.987 --> 11:25.291
that you're having nightmares,
it's a sign you should not come.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.593
- You really think so?
- Yeah, I really think so.

11:27.593 --> 11:30.797
Take a deep breath
and get some sleep, okay?

11:30.797 --> 11:33.466
- Yeah.
- I've got a busy day tomorrow.

11:33.466 --> 11:35.738
Busy day with the Caftans.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.510
<i>I just saw Stu
at the hospital,</i>

11:43.510 --> 11:45.110
and I'm very worried.

11:45.110 --> 11:48.914
I mean, how could Stu
have a stroke, of all people?

11:48.914 --> 11:51.250
You know Stu.
You know Stu, Larry.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.721
You know, I...
...I really don't know him.

11:54.721 --> 11:56.990
Oh, Larry.
You mean the world to him.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.591
I can't possibly mean anything
to him.

11:58.591 --> 12:00.059
I've never even
had lunch with the guy.

12:00.059 --> 12:02.595
But let me tell you,
I blame Susie Greene

12:02.595 --> 12:04.496
for this situation.

12:04.496 --> 12:06.132
- Susie Greene?
- Oh, yeah.

12:06.132 --> 12:10.870
The other day, she brought over
this massive tub of foie gras,

12:10.870 --> 12:14.340
but she knows I'm dieting
and watching my weight.

12:14.340 --> 12:16.108
- What a bitch.
- She brought it over

12:16.108 --> 12:17.877
just so you'd eat it
and get fat?

12:17.877 --> 12:20.980
Here's the thing.
Stu ate the entire tub himself.

12:20.980 --> 12:24.350
It seems like he was trying
to fill a hole somehow.

12:24.350 --> 12:26.652
Everybody has an Achilles' heel.

12:26.652 --> 12:28.888
An entire tub sounds
like an Achilles' foot.

12:28.888 --> 12:31.023
Well, anyway, let me talk to you

12:31.023 --> 12:33.693
about why I wanted
to meet today.

12:33.693 --> 12:36.528
- Mm-hmm.
- In case Stu doesn't make it,

12:36.528 --> 12:40.066
- he has some requests.
- What do you mean, "requests"?

12:40.066 --> 12:44.536
He wants you to keep
an eye on Olivia.

12:44.536 --> 12:47.176
- Who?
- Our 11-year-old daughter.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.547
Me, keep an eye
on your 11-year-old daughter?

12:53.547 --> 12:54.714
You gotta be kidding.

12:54.714 --> 12:56.548
I don't know anything
about children.

12:56.548 --> 13:01.054
Who better to step up
at this time than you, Larry?

13:01.054 --> 13:02.421
Anybody in the world.
Go out in the stre--

13:02.421 --> 13:04.791
A homeless person
would do a better job than me.

13:04.791 --> 13:06.620
I'm telling you what he told me.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.061
Well, this is crazy.
I don't like children.

13:09.061 --> 13:10.930
- I've never spoken to a child...
- Oh!

13:10.930 --> 13:13.299
...without contempt in my voice
in my life!

13:13.299 --> 13:16.335
- So, are you sure?
- It's Stu's wish.

13:16.335 --> 13:20.640
- Is this a financial thing?
- No, it's soccer,

13:20.640 --> 13:22.341
homework, boy stuff.

13:22.341 --> 13:28.347
You know, Olivia this week said
she's now identifying as a cat,

13:28.347 --> 13:31.751
and I'm sure you could really
help her with that, Larry.

13:31.751 --> 13:33.853
Well...
Like what? Buy her a litter box?

13:33.853 --> 13:35.689
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.657
I think you underestimate
yourself.

13:37.657 --> 13:39.191
Did anybody else
get any requests?

13:39.191 --> 13:41.627
Well,
he wants Freddy Funkhouser

13:41.627 --> 13:44.363
to take care
of his antique violin.

13:44.363 --> 13:46.065
- What?
- And to sell it.

13:46.065 --> 13:49.002
It was once played
by Jascha Heifetz

13:49.002 --> 13:51.070
- at Carnegie Hall.
- Are you kidding?

13:51.070 --> 13:53.072
Freddy Funkhouser gets
to sell a violin,

13:53.072 --> 13:54.941
and I get
to take care of Catwoman?

13:54.941 --> 13:57.710
- Why didn't I get the violin?
- Oh, they're early!

13:57.710 --> 14:00.379
Hi, sweetie. Aw.

14:00.379 --> 14:01.981
- How did it go today?
- Hi.

14:01.981 --> 14:03.116
It was okay today.

14:03.116 --> 14:05.785
We were a cat,
so lots of scratches,

14:05.785 --> 14:07.287
- but she didn't break the skin.
- Good.

14:07.287 --> 14:08.821
- Uh-huh.
- Olivia,

14:08.821 --> 14:11.857
- I want you to meet Larry.
- Hey! Yeah.

14:11.857 --> 14:13.860
Hello, pussycat.

14:13.860 --> 14:17.963
- Ooh! Hello.
- And this is Katie, our nanny.

14:17.963 --> 14:20.099
- Uh-huh. Hey. Hmm.
- Hi.

14:20.099 --> 14:22.234
- Do you like hockey?
- No.

14:22.234 --> 14:25.204
Do you think Puerto Rico
should become a state?

14:25.204 --> 14:28.207
- Who cares?
- Have you ever tasted a beer?

14:28.207 --> 14:32.145
- Gross. I like your sweatshirt.
- Really? Yes, I like it too.

14:32.145 --> 14:34.280
Yeah, but there's something
on the string.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.182
Hey! What are you doing?

14:36.182 --> 14:38.017
What was that?
What'd you do that for?

14:38.017 --> 14:39.285
'Cause cats like string.

14:39.285 --> 14:41.220
It's okay. You'll just wear it
without the string.

14:41.220 --> 14:43.155
You can't wear a sweatshirt
without the string.

14:43.155 --> 14:44.957
You ruined
my sweatshirt, Mittens.

14:51.130 --> 14:53.298
Oh, come on. This is impossible.

14:53.298 --> 14:55.267
- It's impossible.
- Yeah. That shit's hard.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.036
It's like trying to put
toothpaste back in the tube.

14:57.036 --> 14:58.437
But dumb motherfuckers
try to put the shit back

14:58.437 --> 15:00.272
in the same little hole
you squeeze it out of.

15:00.272 --> 15:02.842
- Can't go back in the same hole.
- That's what I'm saying.

15:02.842 --> 15:04.310
You cut the bottom
of that bitch open

15:04.310 --> 15:06.478
and put the shit inside
then reseal the bottom.

15:06.478 --> 15:09.382
- This is harder than toothpaste.
- Know what you gotta do
with that?

15:09.382 --> 15:11.283
You gotta moisten
that motherfucker.

15:11.283 --> 15:13.185
Yeah. Like trying
to thread a needle.

15:13.185 --> 15:15.121
Yeah, yeah, lick that shit good.

15:15.121 --> 15:16.623
You gotta get
that bitch in that hole.

15:18.558 --> 15:20.660
Ah!

15:20.660 --> 15:22.662
- Ugh.
- Huh!

15:22.662 --> 15:24.792
Ah. No, no, no, no.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.365
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.

15:26.365 --> 15:29.168
I'm just trying to get
this string in the hole here.

15:29.168 --> 15:32.171
Uh, do you have any tricks?
Any housekeeping tricks?

15:32.171 --> 15:34.073
- No?
- No. No housekeeper tricks.

15:34.073 --> 15:35.875
- Sorry. No. No.
- You know tricks? Huh.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.010
Also, one more thing.

15:37.010 --> 15:39.640
I noticed when you put
new toilet paper on,

15:39.640 --> 15:40.980
you always put it on
from the bottom,

15:40.980 --> 15:42.548
so I have to go to the bottom.

15:42.548 --> 15:45.217
I like it from the top.
Rolls out a lot easier.

15:45.217 --> 15:46.519
You can rip it off like that.

15:46.519 --> 15:48.254
Yep, there's people
who do it from the top.

15:48.254 --> 15:49.722
You know, you roll like this.

15:49.722 --> 15:51.457
And people who do it
from the bottom,

15:51.457 --> 15:52.859
you do it like this,

15:52.859 --> 15:55.161
it's almost as if
you're un-wiping your ass.

15:55.161 --> 15:56.596
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:56.596 --> 15:57.764
- Okay.
- Can I go now?

15:57.764 --> 15:59.566
- Yeah.
- Bye.

15:59.566 --> 16:00.669
Okay.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.803
This is--
This is unbelievable.

16:03.803 --> 16:05.337
- Yeah.
- It's just so awkward.

16:05.337 --> 16:08.173
You know, sometimes
when you have sex with somebody,

16:08.173 --> 16:09.809
you become
a different person afterwards?

16:09.809 --> 16:11.343
- Yeah.
- Well, we didn't have sex.

16:11.343 --> 16:14.146
- She just caught me having sex.
- Yeah. She's uncomfortable,

16:14.146 --> 16:15.447
but now it's making
you uncomfortable.

16:15.447 --> 16:17.684
She's not cleaning.
She's not doing anything.

16:17.684 --> 16:19.185
I'd like to fire her
but I can't.

16:19.185 --> 16:20.553
I got a trial coming up.

16:20.553 --> 16:23.022
It doesn't look good
that I fired the housekeeper

16:23.022 --> 16:24.756
who saw me having cunnilingus.

16:24.756 --> 16:26.926
Can't get rid of her ass
'cause you got no basis.

16:26.926 --> 16:29.362
Getting caught eating pussy
is not a basis.

16:29.362 --> 16:31.130
So, you fucked.

16:31.130 --> 16:33.232
Yeah.

16:33.232 --> 16:37.704
Oh, my God. This text chain.
This text chain.

16:37.704 --> 16:39.371
"Stay strong everybody."

16:39.371 --> 16:42.041
"Remember, after the rain
comes the rainbow.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.343
"Be the reason
someone smiles today."

16:44.343 --> 16:47.079
Oh, fuck you.
Ridiculous.

16:50.049 --> 16:53.686
Okay, we go for a walk.
Oh, hi. Jeff's not home.

16:53.686 --> 16:55.020
- Huh?
- He just ran out for--

16:55.020 --> 16:56.723
He'll be back in,
like, eh, ten minutes.

16:56.723 --> 16:57.990
What the hell's this?

16:57.990 --> 16:59.892
It's a coyote vest.

16:59.892 --> 17:01.426
They're all over
the fucking neighborhood.

17:01.426 --> 17:03.095
I gotta protect him.
Some people care

17:03.095 --> 17:04.998
if he gets eaten
by a coyote, Larry.

17:04.998 --> 17:07.601
By the way, I just had lunch
with Gina Grossbard.

17:07.601 --> 17:09.035
Oy. That <i>farbissina punim.</i>

17:09.035 --> 17:11.837
She blames you for Stu's stroke.

17:11.837 --> 17:14.206
She thinks-- What, 'cause
I brought over the foie gras?

17:14.206 --> 17:16.375
- Yeah.
- She is so transparent.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.077
Every time she comes here, Larr,

17:18.077 --> 17:21.246
she brings something
from that new French patisserie.

17:21.246 --> 17:23.016
- Eclairs and Napole--
- Yeah.

17:23.016 --> 17:24.383
She's trying to get me fat.

17:24.383 --> 17:27.253
- She wants you to be fat?
- Yes, she does. So I retaliated.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.388
- You retaliated?
- Yeah. Because she's jealous

17:29.388 --> 17:31.090
- that I'm thinner than her...
- Really?

17:31.090 --> 17:32.858
...and I have more style
than her.

17:32.858 --> 17:34.961
- You know, he ate the whole tub.
That night, had a stroke.
- That's his problem.

17:34.961 --> 17:36.428
Because he's a fucking pig.

17:36.428 --> 17:38.197
- It's not my problem.
- Really?

17:38.197 --> 17:40.165
Oh, by the way,
you can play golf

17:40.165 --> 17:41.533
with your boyfriend
this weekend.

17:41.533 --> 17:43.302
Why? I thought he was going
to North Carolina.

17:43.302 --> 17:45.471
He is not coming with me.
I can't have it.

17:45.471 --> 17:47.339
He had a dream last night,
Larry.

17:47.339 --> 17:49.242
- A nightmare about the trip.
- What?

17:49.242 --> 17:51.643
And I thought, "If he's having
this much anxiety

17:51.643 --> 17:53.912
over that flight,
better he should stay home."

17:53.912 --> 17:56.515
- I don't need him
having a stroke. I don't--
- He had a dream?

17:56.515 --> 17:59.552
- Yeah, he had a dream, and--
- Just a-- a nightmare?

17:59.552 --> 18:01.520
He was thrashing around.
It's something like that.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.823
- Oh, the poor guy.
- I believe in respecting
the unconscious.

18:04.823 --> 18:07.593
Yeah, well, that's just
a surprising turn of events.

18:07.593 --> 18:10.863
- Good for you. Oh.
- Yeah. We're going for a walk.

18:10.863 --> 18:12.999
- Yes.
- Is your outfit anti-coyote?

18:12.999 --> 18:15.334
Very funny, Larry.
Go fuck yourself.

18:15.334 --> 18:17.169
You don't know anything
about fashion.

18:17.169 --> 18:19.205
Let's go, buddy.

18:24.112 --> 18:26.779
Oh, hey.
Is this Stu Grossbard's room?

18:26.779 --> 18:28.648
- Yes, it is.
- How's he doing?

18:28.648 --> 18:29.681
It's too early to tell.

18:29.681 --> 18:31.984
- Can I see him?
- Yes, but don't stay long.

18:31.984 --> 18:33.856
- He needs his rest.
- Okay.

18:39.528 --> 18:41.460
Stu. Hey.

18:41.460 --> 18:44.597
- Larr-- Larry.
- Hey, hey! Stuey!

18:44.597 --> 18:46.198
Oh, jeez.

18:46.198 --> 18:49.002
Look at you. What a man
will do for attention, huh?

18:50.336 --> 18:52.538
- Did you talk to Gina?
- I did talk to Gina.

18:52.538 --> 18:55.002
She invited me to lunch,
and, uh, I paid,

18:55.002 --> 18:57.076
which is a little odd
because she invited me.

18:57.076 --> 18:59.178
I'm the invitee.
She's the inviter.

18:59.178 --> 19:01.046
Usually, the inviter pays.

19:01.046 --> 19:02.749
I kind of waited.
I gave her some time,

19:02.749 --> 19:04.918
but it was not forthcoming,
and, you know,

19:04.918 --> 19:06.218
I don't wanna make
a big deal of it.

19:06.218 --> 19:09.355
I don't care, really.
It means nothing to me,

19:09.355 --> 19:11.490
but it's a matter
of common courtesy.

19:11.490 --> 19:12.725
You would think the inviter

19:12.725 --> 19:15.228
should be the one picking it up.
I-- Listen, again,

19:15.228 --> 19:16.729
I didn't care.
It doesn't matter to me.

19:16.729 --> 19:19.198
But she did bring up
something at the lunch

19:19.198 --> 19:20.867
that I wanted to call
to your attention,

19:20.867 --> 19:23.302
which is in the event that...

19:23.302 --> 19:25.937
you know, God forbid,
the worst transpires...

19:25.937 --> 19:30.076
...do I have this right,
that you want me to keep an...

19:30.076 --> 19:32.845
"an eye"
on your 11-year-old daughter?

19:32.845 --> 19:33.880
Yes, Larry.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.414
And, you know, I met
your daughter at the lunch,

19:35.414 --> 19:38.717
and she pulled the string
on my sweatshirt,

19:38.717 --> 19:41.449
and it was all I could do
to restrain myself from yelling,

19:41.449 --> 19:42.688
"You fuck!"

19:42.688 --> 19:44.423
- That's what I wanted
to say to your daughter.
- Uh, right.

19:44.423 --> 19:46.325
She pulled the string out.
The sweatshirt's ruined.

19:46.325 --> 19:49.062
She's curious.
You're passionate.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.997
It's all right.
It's a good combination.

19:51.997 --> 19:53.232
I'm not being modest

19:53.232 --> 19:55.167
when I tell you
that I don't really think

19:55.167 --> 19:56.902
I'm the right person
for this job.

19:56.902 --> 19:59.606
- You are, Larry. You are.
- You know who would be
perfect for this?

19:59.606 --> 20:01.569
Freddy Funkhouser.

20:01.569 --> 20:02.876
- No.
- Oh, yes.

20:02.876 --> 20:06.112
Freddy Funkhouser,
who loves prepubescent girls.

20:06.112 --> 20:07.413
And I mean that in a good way.

20:07.413 --> 20:09.415
He's very excited
to be around them.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.516
And, of course, again,
I mean that in a good way.

20:11.516 --> 20:13.353
This has got Freddy written
all over it.

20:13.353 --> 20:14.721
Freddy's the violin man.

20:14.721 --> 20:16.322
I don't know why
I'm not the violin man.

20:16.322 --> 20:18.224
I grew up taking violin lessons.

20:18.224 --> 20:20.426
Larry, I just know

20:20.426 --> 20:23.596
that you're the right man
for the job.

20:23.596 --> 20:26.265
You must have me confused
with a normal person.

20:26.265 --> 20:29.635
You are the person for Olivia.
You understand?

20:29.635 --> 20:32.339
Okay, Stu. I...

20:32.339 --> 20:33.977
I respect your decision.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.804
Okay.

20:36.804 --> 20:39.648
That puts me at ease.

20:45.151 --> 20:46.653
You're carrying a flask now?

20:46.653 --> 20:48.453
Eh, you know,
I take a couple of nips.

20:48.453 --> 20:50.522
I take a nip here,
a nip there, you know.

20:50.522 --> 20:52.491
I nip away at it,
and then, hopefully,

20:52.491 --> 20:53.758
I won't have
to drink again tonight.

20:53.758 --> 20:56.195
But I feel good. I like it.
So what? You know.

20:56.195 --> 20:57.997
Excuse me.

21:00.299 --> 21:02.367
Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.203
Will you look at the tuchus
on this one?

21:04.203 --> 21:06.100
Hey, you know what?
Is she coming in here?

21:06.100 --> 21:07.539
She giving you sponge baths,
this one? Huh?

21:07.539 --> 21:09.408
Yeah,
she takes care of me, Larry.

21:09.408 --> 21:11.144
I'm not even sure
if she's wearing a bra.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.782
- Am I right, Stu?
- Um...

21:17.252 --> 21:18.484
- Maybe you're--
- Oh, boy.

21:18.484 --> 21:20.252
Maybe you're right, Larr.

21:20.252 --> 21:22.421
Freddy's the right person...

21:22.421 --> 21:23.890
- ...for Olivia.
- Yeah.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.492
And you're-- you're
the right person for the violin.

21:26.492 --> 21:27.726
So, yeah, yeah,
you wanna flop us?

21:27.726 --> 21:29.765
- Yes, I'm gonna flop you, Larry.
- Okay.

21:30.364 --> 21:31.630
I got that violin covered.

21:31.630 --> 21:34.300
The violin
is the least of your worries.

21:34.300 --> 21:35.968
You're my friend, Larry.

21:35.968 --> 21:39.473
Good decision, Stu. I gotta run.
I got a violin to sell.

21:57.926 --> 22:00.325
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:00.325 --> 22:01.861
Just got out
of the shower

22:01.861 --> 22:04.100
and, uh...

22:04.933 --> 22:06.498
...there are no towels.

22:06.498 --> 22:08.972
It's because I can't deal
with the towels right now.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.569
And why is that?

22:10.569 --> 22:13.376
Because I was holding
the towels...

22:14.476 --> 22:17.113
when you and her were...

22:18.346 --> 22:19.445
Ah.

22:19.445 --> 22:22.114
- They remind me of the trauma.
- Oh. The trauma?

22:22.114 --> 22:23.215
Yeah, the trauma.

22:23.215 --> 22:25.284
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

22:25.284 --> 22:27.423
Why don't I get
some new towels?

22:28.155 --> 22:29.455
I think I couldn't.

22:29.455 --> 22:31.858
Like, any--
any sort of towels would be--

22:31.858 --> 22:33.727
- You can't even go near towels?
- No, no, I can't.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.928
So, cleaning any towels
in this house

22:35.928 --> 22:37.897
- is traumatic?
- Yeah.

22:37.897 --> 22:39.932
How 'bout when you take
a shower at home and, uh,

22:39.932 --> 22:42.467
- you use your towels?
- Well, those are my towels.

22:42.467 --> 22:43.868
- Oh, so it's just my towels?
- Yeah.

22:43.868 --> 22:46.671
And even the new towels would
be a reminder of the trauma?

22:46.671 --> 22:50.309
But I also noticed that
my clothing hasn't been washed.

22:50.309 --> 22:52.377
That's also a trauma?

22:52.377 --> 22:53.813
You don't believe me
I have a trauma?

22:53.813 --> 22:56.249
Can we get over the trauma
by tomorrow?

22:56.249 --> 22:58.985
I do my best.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.394
Look at all this shit.

23:08.394 --> 23:10.529
This fucking mess.

23:10.529 --> 23:12.766
Dahlia can't work
because of the trauma.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.734
Wow. This trauma
is out of control right now.

23:14.734 --> 23:16.702
Yeah. Look at this. No towels.

23:16.702 --> 23:18.437
- I'm wet.
- I took a shower this morning.

23:18.437 --> 23:19.772
I had to dry off
with paper towels.

23:19.772 --> 23:21.441
- This is fucking insane.
- She won't do anything.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.508
She's taking advantage

23:22.508 --> 23:23.710
of the whole situation
right now.

23:23.710 --> 23:26.345
Oh, yes. Completely. Completely.

23:26.345 --> 23:27.612
I get she saw you
eating pussy,

23:27.612 --> 23:29.949
but it should not affect
your fucking work.

23:29.949 --> 23:32.418
Yeah. I caught my aunt giving
my Uncle Moishe a--

23:32.418 --> 23:34.386
a blowjob
in the back of a Pontiac,

23:34.386 --> 23:35.687
but if they asked me
to go to the movies,

23:35.687 --> 23:37.256
- I just hopped in the car.
- Fuck yeah, you did.

23:37.256 --> 23:38.857
- Same back seat!
- Yeah, same back seat.

23:38.857 --> 23:41.827
You know, I can still remember
those gabardine slacks unzipped!

23:41.827 --> 23:43.496
Yeah. You might even
have got a lollipop that day,

23:43.496 --> 23:44.629
and it still didn't affect you.

23:44.629 --> 23:45.931
Know what I'm saying?
It still didn't--

23:45.931 --> 23:47.666
- Still didn't affect me.
- It still didn't fuck with you.

23:47.666 --> 23:49.634
I did have a crush
on my aunt, though, after that.

23:49.634 --> 23:51.231
I don't get it, man.
Trauma did that?

23:51.231 --> 23:52.839
Maybe it's some kind
of religious thing.

23:52.839 --> 23:54.506
Is there any mention
of cunnilingus in the Bible?

23:54.506 --> 23:55.707
I don't think
it's in the Old Testament.

23:55.707 --> 23:57.443
Hmm. I don't think
that shit was invented yet.

23:57.443 --> 23:59.746
- That shit didn't start
till the early 1900s, at least.
- No, I don't think so.

23:59.746 --> 24:00.980
Columbus got it
from the Indians,

24:00.980 --> 24:03.182
brought it back
to Spain with grapefruit.

24:03.182 --> 24:04.316
Somebody had to be the first.

24:04.316 --> 24:06.185
There was a cunnilingus pioneer
out there.

24:06.185 --> 24:07.253
We don't know who it was.

24:07.253 --> 24:08.554
They should get some credit
for that.

24:08.554 --> 24:10.323
Put that motherfucker on--
on the Mount Rushmore

24:10.323 --> 24:11.557
of-- of pussy eaters.

24:11.557 --> 24:13.426
They all got their tongue out
and shit. You know what I mean?

24:13.426 --> 24:14.726
That's how the fuck you do it.

24:14.726 --> 24:16.295
- Honor these motherfuckers,
right?
- I'll get it.

24:16.295 --> 24:17.700
Somebody had to start it.

24:20.034 --> 24:21.366
Nah, fuck that.

24:21.366 --> 24:23.436
- Who is it?
- It's Freddy!

24:26.373 --> 24:27.741
Hey! There's my guy.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.641
- Okay if I come in?
- Uh... Yeah.

24:29.641 --> 24:31.444
Great to see you,
old friend.

24:31.444 --> 24:34.547
Boy, it does my heart good
to see an honest face.

24:34.547 --> 24:36.449
I think it comes down
to just loyalty

24:36.449 --> 24:39.351
and someone who's genuine,
who you can count on.

24:39.351 --> 24:40.720
Because that's what
makes a friend.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.055
Anyway, anything on your mind?

24:42.055 --> 24:44.358
Anything you wanna tell a friend
to his face?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.992
- No. I don't...
- No?

24:45.992 --> 24:47.192
Mm.

24:47.192 --> 24:49.898
I gave you a chance to address
the fact that you fucked me.

24:50.832 --> 24:52.531
Yeah.
You took me off the violin,

24:52.531 --> 24:53.966
and you shoved the kid
down my throat,

24:53.966 --> 24:56.563
- and you fucked me, L.D.
- I couldn't do it.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.004
You know what the worst thing
about this whole thing is?

24:58.004 --> 25:00.106
Is that you did it
with my own flask.

25:00.106 --> 25:01.073
You took something elegant,

25:01.073 --> 25:04.177
something classy
and sophisticated like my flask,

25:04.177 --> 25:06.445
and you shoved it up my ass,
and you reamed me with it.

25:06.445 --> 25:08.548
- It was a good idea, though.
- What you did
is terrible.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.715
But it was a good idea.

25:09.715 --> 25:12.251
This is a first-degree,
premeditated fucking.

25:12.251 --> 25:13.519
You know what makes it
even worse?

25:13.519 --> 25:15.888
Is you don't have any remorse.
You're a sociopath.

25:15.888 --> 25:18.625
You fucked me in cold blood,
and you're a monster.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.459
And now I have
to accept the fact

25:20.459 --> 25:22.394
that you're wired
like a fucking lunatic.

25:22.394 --> 25:24.391
I can't take care of kids!
I hate kids!

25:24.391 --> 25:26.798
I'd rather have roaches
in my bathtub as pets

25:26.798 --> 25:29.368
- than take care of a kid!
- And I'm fucking Mary Poppins?

25:29.368 --> 25:31.137
You're a very affable
and genial fella!

25:31.137 --> 25:32.805
You could do a much better job
than I can!

25:32.805 --> 25:34.140
- You have a knack!
- What? No!

25:34.140 --> 25:35.707
My humor's way
too sophisticated for a child!

25:35.707 --> 25:37.376
Yes, you are.
You always take time for people!

25:37.376 --> 25:39.845
- No, I don't! I make no time!
- You're completely courteous!

25:39.845 --> 25:41.347
I can't even believe
the way people talk

25:41.347 --> 25:42.647
about you behind your back!

25:42.647 --> 25:43.783
-"Oh, that Freddy Funkhouser!"
- You know what?

25:43.783 --> 25:45.317
"He's the nicest guy
I've ever met!"

25:45.317 --> 25:46.452
Oh, my God! I'm the nicest guy?

25:46.452 --> 25:47.886
People always say
how lovely you are!

25:47.886 --> 25:49.489
- Nobody says that!
Nobody says that!
-"Oh, he's so funny!

25:49.489 --> 25:50.756
Larry brightens the party!"

25:50.756 --> 25:52.252
Nobody's said a decent word
about me my entire life!

25:52.252 --> 25:53.492
What, are you crazy?
People love you!

25:53.492 --> 25:54.727
I don't even say
decent words about me!

25:54.727 --> 25:55.895
Yes, I do!
I say it all the time!

25:55.895 --> 25:57.330
I say,
"He's honest, he's loyal!"

25:57.330 --> 25:58.801
I won't say it anymore!

26:00.001 --> 26:01.467
It was a terrible thing
that you did.

26:01.467 --> 26:04.098
My one regret
is that I had to use your flask.

26:04.098 --> 26:05.038
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:05.038 --> 26:07.334
That may be your first regret,
but that's--

26:07.334 --> 26:09.474
that's not gonna be
your only regret.

26:09.474 --> 26:11.043
There's gonna be
a series of regrets,

26:11.043 --> 26:14.013
because if you think
I'm gonna take a nap

26:14.013 --> 26:17.116
while you fuck me, you're crazy.
I'm awake.

26:17.116 --> 26:19.052
- This thing's only just begun.
- Oh, really?

26:19.052 --> 26:21.386
And I'm about to roll over
and do some fucking myself.

26:21.386 --> 26:22.487
That guy could be dead
any second.

26:22.487 --> 26:23.622
You're getting fucked
pretty soon.

26:23.622 --> 26:24.791
I don't know what you think
you're gonna do.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.158
I'm gonna roll over
and fuck you.

26:26.158 --> 26:28.728
That guy thinks
I'm an alcoholic!

26:28.728 --> 26:30.934
Freddy? What are you gonna do?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.172
Oh, for God's sake.

26:36.972 --> 26:41.710
Ah, this chain! This chain!

26:45.077 --> 26:46.315
Stu, you all right?

26:47.581 --> 26:49.315
I came full throttle
from Cabazon,

26:49.315 --> 26:50.510
from the outlet store.

26:50.510 --> 26:51.951
- I'm glad to be with you.
- My friend, Freddy.

26:51.951 --> 26:53.753
Can I cheer you up
with some pretty good news?

26:53.753 --> 26:56.122
I think I got a couple leads
on the violin.

26:56.122 --> 26:57.423
Uh, you talked to Gina?

26:57.423 --> 26:58.925
No, no,
I'm getting a bidding war going.

26:58.925 --> 27:01.293
I can't do it, Freddy.
I gotta switch it up.

27:01.293 --> 27:04.391
You gotta take Olivia.
Larry's gonna sell the violin.

27:04.391 --> 27:06.298
You wanna have a nest egg
for Olivia,

27:06.298 --> 27:08.134
you need me moving that violin.

27:08.134 --> 27:10.970
- And Larry's great with kids.
- I don't know about that.

27:10.970 --> 27:12.972
He's super comfortable
with really young girls.

27:12.972 --> 27:15.274
Not in a bad way, but nice,
like laughing and joking.

27:15.274 --> 27:16.409
He's like a porcupine.

27:16.409 --> 27:17.910
He puts those things out
and is prickly

27:17.910 --> 27:19.444
'cause he wants
to keep people away,

27:19.444 --> 27:20.912
but he puts 'em down
for the kids,

27:20.912 --> 27:23.850
and he brings those kids in,
he gives 'em a nice, snug hug.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.052
He holds on to 'em super tight.
Not in a bad way.

27:26.052 --> 27:28.120
They love to cuddle with him
because he smells good,

27:28.120 --> 27:30.256
and he's always got
a clever line he whispers.

27:30.256 --> 27:31.691
He's playful. The girls love it.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.959
They sit and laugh,
and, you know,

27:32.959 --> 27:34.527
it's a little push,
a little pull, and...

27:34.527 --> 27:36.129
Not in a bad way,
but they connect.

27:36.129 --> 27:38.097
I appreciate everything
you're saying.

27:38.097 --> 27:40.333
If I was gonna pick someone,
I'd pick Larry David.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.633
I made up my mind.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.269
I think you're missing
the big picture here.

27:43.269 --> 27:45.872
Larry is selling the violin,

27:45.872 --> 27:48.841
and you are keeping an eye
on Olivia.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.677
And that's my final word,
Freddy.

27:51.677 --> 27:54.213
If that's what you want,
then I'll honor that.

27:54.213 --> 27:56.882
It is.

27:56.882 --> 28:00.052
I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.
I've had the, uh, sun in my eyes

28:00.052 --> 28:01.320
since I've been driving
from the outlets.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.222
- You mind if I take a seat?
- No. Go ahead, Freddy.

28:03.222 --> 28:05.692
- It just hit me.
- I want you to stick around.

28:05.692 --> 28:06.893
I'm so tired.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.863
I think I'm about
to fall asleep on my feet.

28:09.863 --> 28:11.063
You mind if I rest my eyes?

28:11.063 --> 28:14.233
No. I think I'm gonna go
to sleep too, Freddy.

28:22.541 --> 28:24.447
You don't need
to finish high school.

28:25.346 --> 28:26.545
You need to pay your dues

28:26.545 --> 28:28.547
at the mattress store
in Temecula.

28:30.484 --> 28:31.683
You want a book?

28:31.683 --> 28:34.019
Next thing is
you're gonna be wanting socks.

28:34.019 --> 28:38.157
And take off that skirt,
you look like a whore.

28:38.157 --> 28:39.659
I said take it off!

28:39.659 --> 28:44.163
It's not hard
to make friends.

28:44.163 --> 28:47.767
It's just nobody likes you.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.902
It's a pocketknife.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.408
You're supposed
to cut yourself sometimes.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.410
That's how you learn.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.844
You shit in the bucket,
you clean the bucket.

28:58.844 --> 29:00.316
Those are the house rules.

29:01.115 --> 29:03.049
Who cares
if it's your birthday?

29:03.049 --> 29:06.118
We go to cockfights.
That's what this family does.

29:06.118 --> 29:10.422
- It's tradition.
- Freddy.

29:10.422 --> 29:12.926
You'll come out of the basement
when I'm good and ready.

29:12.926 --> 29:15.431
- Freddy.
- Hey, you're fat.

29:16.031 --> 29:17.497
- You're fat!
- Freddy!

29:17.497 --> 29:19.432
Freddy.

29:19.432 --> 29:21.233
Hey. Ah. What's going on?

29:21.233 --> 29:24.003
So sorry.
I was having the craziest dream.

29:24.003 --> 29:25.271
Yeah, I know.

29:25.271 --> 29:27.506
- I was exhausted.
- I've changed my mind.

29:27.506 --> 29:29.508
You're back on the violin.

29:29.508 --> 29:31.144
- You're flopping?
- I'm flopping.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.707
All right, well,
that's what you want,

29:33.707 --> 29:35.381
that's what it is.
I'll be sure to let Larry know.

29:35.381 --> 29:37.617
I'd love to stay,
but I got a Zoom in Vacaville

29:37.617 --> 29:38.752
with one
of my mattress shops, okay?

29:38.752 --> 29:39.953
You're the best, Freddy.

29:39.953 --> 29:41.454
And, um,
don't worry about that violin.

29:41.454 --> 29:43.389
- I'm moving it.
- Bye.

29:43.389 --> 29:47.931
Very busy tongue.

29:49.064 --> 29:50.066
Ah!

29:55.903 --> 29:57.306
Awful.

29:57.805 --> 29:59.572
Head and legs.

29:59.572 --> 30:03.477
Bald head, moving up and down.

30:07.714 --> 30:09.448
I must have fallen asleep.

30:09.448 --> 30:11.617
- Oh, what happened?
- I was having a nightmare.

30:11.617 --> 30:14.987
Oh, yeah, sounds like it.
You poor thing. Are you okay?

30:14.987 --> 30:17.056
Maybe bec--
because of the trauma.

30:17.056 --> 30:19.158
Okay. Let me tell you something.

30:19.158 --> 30:21.561
You're using the dream scheme
on the wrong guy.

30:21.561 --> 30:22.795
I invented it.

30:22.795 --> 30:24.130
I can't forget what I saw.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.399
This is over.
I don't wanna fire anybody,

30:26.399 --> 30:27.833
but I will fire,

30:27.833 --> 30:29.268
and I'll hate myself
for doing it.

30:29.268 --> 30:31.771
But if you don't
come in tomorrow and work,

30:31.771 --> 30:33.172
I'm gonna do it. Okay?

30:33.172 --> 30:34.841
And take your feet
off the couch.

30:34.841 --> 30:36.509
Hey, Leon!

30:36.509 --> 30:38.247
I'm gonna go get that violin!

30:42.216 --> 30:44.320
Take care.

30:47.456 --> 30:48.955
- Larry.
- Yeah.

30:48.955 --> 30:51.123
Waylan Grossbard.

30:51.123 --> 30:53.092
- Do I know you?
- I'm Stu's cousin

30:53.092 --> 30:54.894
from the family text chain.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.096
Oh. Oh, yeah, the text chain.

30:57.096 --> 30:58.730
Yeah,
we love that you're on there.

30:58.730 --> 31:02.502
- I noticed you haven't
really been very active on it.
- Yeah.

31:02.502 --> 31:03.603
- No.
- Barely replying

31:03.603 --> 31:06.138
- at all, actually.
- Yeah, uh...

31:06.138 --> 31:08.975
Well, we're noticing it's really
been helpful for everybody,

31:08.975 --> 31:10.910
- keeping us in the loop...
- Has it? Is it? Really? Is it?

31:10.910 --> 31:12.679
...and sort of positive spirits.

31:12.679 --> 31:13.980
- Is it helpful?
- Yeah.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.015
- Yeah, you think so?
- Yeah. I don't know if you saw.

31:16.015 --> 31:17.644
My niece sent a great photo

31:17.644 --> 31:19.753
- of Stu and her by the lake.
- Oh, yeah.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.591
Uh-huh, yeah.
That was really, uh...

31:23.058 --> 31:24.591
- cute.
- Cute.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.058
Yeah.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.160
You think you're too good
for the chain?

31:28.160 --> 31:31.298
You know what? Waylan?
Is that your name?

31:31.298 --> 31:33.132
- Yeah.
- I do.

31:33.132 --> 31:35.068
I think I'm too good
for the chain.

31:35.068 --> 31:36.730
Oh. I'm sorry you don't wanna
help your friend.

31:36.730 --> 31:38.538
- Help?
- You know,
it takes minimal effort

31:38.538 --> 31:39.672
just to reply.

31:39.672 --> 31:42.041
Even a "ha-ha" or a thumbs up--

31:42.041 --> 31:44.210
Oh, really?
Are there funny things on there

31:44.210 --> 31:45.878
- that require a ha-ha?
- I mean--

31:45.878 --> 31:48.013
If you read through it,
there's a lot of--

31:48.013 --> 31:49.682
- Can I be honest with you?
- Please.

31:49.682 --> 31:51.551
I'm overwhelmed by this chain.

31:51.551 --> 31:53.452
Every two minutes it's, "Ding!"

31:53.452 --> 31:55.187
I'm getting a ding.
I'm getting a ding.

31:55.187 --> 31:58.424
Too many dings! And what is it?
It's just these ridiculous,

31:58.424 --> 32:01.694
inspirational sentiments
that amount to nothing.

32:01.694 --> 32:03.062
They're all trite.

32:03.062 --> 32:05.931
I don't even know why
people bother to write them!

32:05.931 --> 32:08.801
- It's been a really hard time
for the family, so--
- You want me to give it a ha-ha?

32:08.801 --> 32:10.637
- A ha-ha?
- Or a heart.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.937
That's also an option.

32:11.937 --> 32:13.806
But it seems like
that's too much for you.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.140
You know what's too much for me?

32:15.140 --> 32:17.443
This chain is too much for me.
I want off this chain.

32:17.443 --> 32:19.378
Once you're off the chain,
you can't get back on the chain.

32:19.378 --> 32:21.313
Oh, don't.
Don't say that. Really?

32:21.313 --> 32:23.115
I would text this to you,
but I know you won't read it,

32:23.115 --> 32:24.450
so here's the real-life emoji.

32:24.450 --> 32:26.753
- There you go.
- Oh! I'll give that a ha-ha!

32:26.753 --> 32:28.454
- No, ha-ha to you.
- Ha! Ha-ha!

32:28.454 --> 32:30.518
- Ha-ha to you, sir.
- Ah, ha-ha!

32:30.518 --> 32:31.323
You know, you're a real asshole.

32:31.323 --> 32:32.925
- Oh, I'm an asshole?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:32.925 --> 32:34.227
- Oh, I'm an asshole.
- Yeah.

32:34.227 --> 32:36.695
I'm the one writing--
I'm the one writing,

32:36.695 --> 32:40.795
"Tough times remind us
that our spirits are strong!"

32:40.795 --> 32:42.702
- Yeah, I wrote that!
- Yeah, I know you did!

32:42.702 --> 32:44.536
Well, heart it if you like it!

32:44.536 --> 32:46.505
- Yeah, I'll heart it.
- Oh, is that an emoji?

32:46.505 --> 32:48.207
- Smiley--
- That's a nice smiley face.

32:48.207 --> 32:49.942
- Yeah. Oh, oh, oh.
- Oh. Oh, the praise hands.

32:49.942 --> 32:52.779
- So you know the emojis,
you just won't use them.
- Praise-- Praise hands.

32:52.779 --> 32:54.079
Oh, nice. A thumbs-up.

32:54.079 --> 32:56.015
- Well, ha-ha to you, sir.
- Ha-ha!

32:56.015 --> 32:58.017
Ha-ha to you. Yeah, yeah.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.186
- Thank you. Fuck you.
- Oh, ho-ho!

33:05.191 --> 33:07.827
Larry! What a surprise.

33:07.827 --> 33:10.930
Hi. Um, you know,
I thought I'd come over

33:10.930 --> 33:14.033
and, uh, pick up the violin.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.002
You know, I don't want
to appear insensitive,

33:16.002 --> 33:18.170
- but, you know, just in case.
- Oh. No.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.905
I'll get--
I'll get a head start on things.

33:19.905 --> 33:21.974
No, there's no need.
Freddy's here.

33:21.974 --> 33:24.077
- What?
- Stu made a change.

33:24.077 --> 33:26.012
Freddy's taking the violin.

33:26.012 --> 33:28.151
- Are you-- What?
- Yeah.

33:29.084 --> 33:31.550
Hey! Hey!

33:31.550 --> 33:33.285
What are you--
What are you doing?

33:33.285 --> 33:35.120
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

33:35.120 --> 33:36.522
I'm fulfilling my obligation
to Stu.

33:36.522 --> 33:38.123
- You don't get the violin.
- Listen to me--

33:38.123 --> 33:39.291
- I get the violin.
- Listen. No, no, no, no.

33:39.291 --> 33:40.827
Stu put me
in charge of the violin.

33:40.827 --> 33:42.161
No,
I think you're mistaken.

33:42.161 --> 33:43.296
- What's going on?
- Doesn't Stu want me--

33:43.296 --> 33:45.965
Freddy went to see Stu
at the hospital,

33:45.965 --> 33:48.134
and he got tired,
he fell asleep,

33:48.134 --> 33:51.971
and he had these nightmares
about raising Olivia.

33:51.971 --> 33:55.207
Oh! Really?

33:55.207 --> 33:57.143
I wonder
where you got that from!

33:57.143 --> 33:59.713
He was having nightmares!
It's all bullshit!

33:59.713 --> 34:00.980
There's no nightmares!

34:00.980 --> 34:02.514
It's a nightmare con!

34:02.514 --> 34:04.784
And I know,
'cause I invented it!

34:04.784 --> 34:07.186
- It's a scam!
- What! A scam?

34:07.186 --> 34:09.388
You invented the nightmare con?

34:09.388 --> 34:11.891
Jeff's dream
was all a fucking lie?

34:11.891 --> 34:14.260
- No, but he-- I--
- Oh, I am so on to you

34:14.260 --> 34:15.623
and your little friend Jeff.

34:15.623 --> 34:17.163
Well, I didn't put him up to it.

34:17.163 --> 34:19.026
Oh, man, I'm gonna kill
that fat motherfucker!

34:19.026 --> 34:21.467
Oh, I brought you a kale salad
as a peace offering.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.269
You know,
it hardly has any calories.

34:23.269 --> 34:25.104
And I'm gonna
fucking kill him, Larry!

34:25.104 --> 34:27.706
And it's gonna be your fault!
Enjoy.

34:32.546 --> 34:34.080
No, no, no!
Don't even think about it!

34:34.080 --> 34:35.448
- I move the Heifetz!
- Don't! No, no, no, no!

34:35.448 --> 34:37.149
- They want me to have it!
- Give me the fucking thing!

34:37.149 --> 34:38.450
- Give it to me!
- Stop it!

34:38.450 --> 34:42.188
Stop it! Put it back!
Put it back and get out!

34:44.558 --> 34:45.628
All right.

34:52.595 --> 34:54.170
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

35:03.345 --> 35:04.543
Get out!

35:04.543 --> 35:08.317
I don't want either one of you
taking care of anything!

35:10.786 --> 35:12.116
You have a lovely home.

35:14.923 --> 35:16.159
We'll, uh...

35:17.091 --> 35:18.627
We'll talk on the text chain.

35:24.533 --> 35:25.431
Okay.

35:32.641 --> 35:34.907
- Not bad. Yeah?
- Eh.

35:34.907 --> 35:36.708
- You know what?
- Hmm?

35:36.708 --> 35:39.077
I think you would've been
a much better dad.

35:39.077 --> 35:41.347
- Are we talking
in all seriousness?
- In all seriousness.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.749
You would've been
a hell of a father.

35:42.749 --> 35:43.715
Are you kidding?

35:43.715 --> 35:45.852
Social workers would've
descended on the house

35:45.852 --> 35:47.220
within two weeks.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.893
Oh. Hi.

35:53.893 --> 35:55.729
- I'm Renee.
- Yeah.

35:55.729 --> 35:58.097
- We met.
- I remember.

35:58.097 --> 36:00.199
Hey, listen.
About the other day,

36:00.199 --> 36:02.134
I know it was really awkward,

36:02.134 --> 36:03.836
but it's not even
really my thing.

36:03.836 --> 36:05.004
You know? It's Larry's thing.

36:05.004 --> 36:07.807
- He really likes that. I mean--
- Yeah.

36:07.807 --> 36:10.009
Anyway, uh, where's Larry?

36:10.009 --> 36:11.610
- He's not here.
- Got it.

36:11.610 --> 36:13.245
Well, I'm gonna leave this here
for him,

36:13.245 --> 36:15.048
because someone from the gallery
is gonna be by later

36:15.048 --> 36:18.951
to box it up before the showing,
but I-- I wanted him to see it.

36:18.951 --> 36:20.389
I take it.

36:21.389 --> 36:22.959
Okay. Do you need some help?

36:24.558 --> 36:26.963
Guess not.

36:48.181 --> 36:51.215
Excuse me.
Could I have a-- a water?

36:52.586 --> 36:53.919
<i>This is your pilot speaking.</i>

36:53.919 --> 36:56.456
<i>I'm sorry to report that due
to some inclement weather</i>

36:56.456 --> 36:57.623
<i>in the Raleigh-Durham area,</i>

36:57.623 --> 36:59.592
<i>this flight is being diverted
to Greensboro.</i>

36:59.592 --> 37:01.321
<i>Ground control
has informed me</i>

37:01.321 --> 37:03.997
<i>that we'll be able to bus you
to your final destinations.</i>

37:16.144 --> 37:18.710
So he jumped
right into Sheepshead Bay.

37:18.710 --> 37:22.681
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, no, that's crazy.

37:27.889 --> 37:29.292
What the fuck?
