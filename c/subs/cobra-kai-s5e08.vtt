00:28.278 --> 00:30.572
Distinguished members of the Sekai Taikai,

00:31.281 --> 00:33.658
I thank you for gracing us
with your presence.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.830
Sensei Silver. I'm Gunther Braun.
I speak for the Sekai Taikai.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.375
As you know,
our admission process is quite rigorous.

00:42.459 --> 00:45.920
Despite your overtures,
we cannot guarantee admission.

00:46.004 --> 00:46.880
Understood.

00:46.963 --> 00:50.008
But I assure you,
Cobra Kai is worthy of entry.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.095
As you can see,
our dojo is state-of-the-art.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.973

01:00.643 --> 01:01.811

in the world.

It's a shame
more people haven't heard of them.

help each other out.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.784

Until now.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.505
[Gunther chuckles]

01:28.588 --> 01:33.259
Karate gave my life structure,
function, purpose,

01:33.343 --> 01:35.345
and it's doing the same for my students.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.099

to learn and grow through karate.

just as much as Cobra Kai.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.213
Looks like you're gonna have
a rematch against LaRusso.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.465
You ready?

11:57.591 --> 11:58.551
Yes, Sensei.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.136
Good.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.555
Payne.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.434
Ready to take on
whomever they pick as their top fighter?

12:06.934 --> 12:08.853
-Yes, Sensei.
-[Silver] You better be.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.440
Because the fate of this dojo
rests in your fists.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.532
[Tory] They're expecting me to fight,
but if I win, it helps Cobra Kai.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.367
So what do I do?

12:25.619 --> 12:27.037
You do what's right for you.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.082
-What's that supposed to mean?
-[Kreese] You said it.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.501
Winning gives you new opportunities.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.129
What the hell are you talking about?

12:35.629 --> 12:37.798
The plan was to stop Silver
and get you out.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.009
We're not doing
anything like that anymore.

12:41.218 --> 12:45.139
Nothing we do is gonna get me out of here.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.141
I've been helping you this whole time.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.353
Keeping secrets from everyone I know.
And what? Now you're just done?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.481
I've put you through enough.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.651
The best thing you can do right now
is look after yourself.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.655
[exhales]

13:03.032 --> 13:03.908
Screw this.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.746
This is what I get
for putting my trust in anyone.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.750
I'm always the one
picking up the pieces. [sighs]

13:12.833 --> 13:14.835
[somber music plays]

13:23.761 --> 13:25.721
Okay, who's ready for round two?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.431
Okay. Jesus Christ…

13:28.057 --> 13:31.811
-Wow, you guys can take down a pizza.
-The honeys love a man that can eat.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.356
What honeys? Our dojo has more sausage
than this pizza.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.859
-We not enough for you, penis breath?
-Definitely not.

13:38.943 --> 13:39.944
[laughter]

13:40.027 --> 13:42.655
We have a choice to make,
and it's not gonna be easy.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.742
You're all badass fighters, but only
one of you can get on the mat tomorrow.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.246
Hawk's the current All Valley champ.
But it could've gone either way.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.706
Diaz is last year's champ.
That could've gone either way too.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.708
Even though Hawk injured Robby
in the semis,

13:54.792 --> 13:57.670
Hawk didn't have to fight in the semis
this year. Diaz booked it to Mexico.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.673
Point being you're all deserving.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.424
LaRusso, Chozen and I
are having a hard time

14:02.508 --> 14:04.593
deciding which of you
should go up against Cobra Kai.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.262
Maybe we should flip a coin.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.475
-How would that work? There's three of us.
-So we'll flip three coins.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.478
We don't need to flip any coins.
We already made up our minds.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.982
Yeah. We talked about it,
and there's only one choice.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.068
-It should be Hawk.
-He beat me fair and square.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.905
I bowed out of the last tournament.
He deserves to represent us.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.991
[gentle music plays]

14:27.074 --> 14:31.662
Wow. It's an honor I don't take lightly.
I'm prepared for the challenge.

14:31.745 --> 14:32.997
All right. We'll train tonight.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.125
Uh, what about Sam? Where's she?

14:36.208 --> 14:39.336
-[grunting]
-[Chozen] Yes.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.504
[Sam grunts]

14:40.588 --> 14:43.966
Looking unbeatable. Let's not overdo it.
That's enough for tonight.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.050
Are you sure?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.260
I-I can go again.

14:46.343 --> 14:49.305
Must rest. Save for tomorrow. Hm?

14:53.934 --> 14:54.768
Sam.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.732
You're sharper than ever. Okay?
The student is surpassing the teacher.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.027
You got this.
Tory won't know what hit her.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.530
Thanks. But, uh,

15:08.073 --> 15:09.658
that's not really the problem.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.078
I guess I wasn't expecting
to be back so soon.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.206
After the tournament,
when you closed the dojo,

15:17.207 --> 15:18.125
I was angry.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.422
But then I started to think
that maybe it was for the best.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.674
That I needed a break.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.179
And now being back here and training
with everybody has been so great.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.057
I just…

15:34.558 --> 15:36.560
I'm back in this winner-takes-all match.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.188
It feels like I'm right where I started.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.190
Me against Tory.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.401
Samantha-san,

15:45.611 --> 15:47.821
fight not against opponent.

15:49.698 --> 15:53.452
Many years ago,
your father and I had big fight.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.246
You know story.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.582
I wanted to prove

15:59.667 --> 16:00.584
I was better.

16:01.085 --> 16:01.961
Better fighter.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.129
Better man.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.133
He was definitely one hell of a fighter.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.970
But I was fighting against.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.306
Your father was fighting for.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.850
Fighting for friends.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.519
For village. For…

16:19.770 --> 16:20.813
For Miyagi-san.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.608
For my senseis.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.443
And for you, Sam.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.278
For you.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.364
[inspiring music plays]

16:32.491 --> 16:35.494
Go on. You're missing the pizza party.
We'll see you at home.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.581
[inspiring music continues]

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
[music fades]

17:04.690 --> 17:08.360
[grunting]

17:08.444 --> 17:09.945
[Silver] Burning the midnight oil?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.365
I don't think
I'll be able to sleep tonight.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.951
Figured I might as well
get some extra practice in.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.454
You've got pre-fight jitters.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.832
Whoever they put up, I'll be fighting
someone with way more experience.

17:22.332 --> 17:26.378
-He'll be bigger, stronger than me.
-Hey. Don't count yourself out.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.340
Before I started training
in the Way of the Fist,

17:30.424 --> 17:31.967
know what they used to called me?

17:32.968 --> 17:33.802
Twig.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.473
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.766
Didn't let it stop me.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.727
You're on your way
to becoming one of the best.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.563
LaRusso, Lawrence,

17:45.397 --> 17:46.440
Diaz, Keene,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
they've all had their time in the sun.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.278
Now it's your turn.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.948
Let me show you something.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.535
My master taught me this years ago.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.372
I've made a few tweaks.
I call it the Silver bullet.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.625
-That's good.
-You like that, huh?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.754
If you strike
with the right speed and trajectory,

18:08.837 --> 18:10.214
right between the ribs,

18:10.714 --> 18:13.050
you can cause your opponent
significant damage.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.094
Literally take their breath away.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.515
[Silver inhales deeply]

18:19.598 --> 18:21.600
[tense music plays]

18:24.812 --> 18:26.605
[tense music crescendos]

18:26.688 --> 18:27.606
[Silver grunts]

18:30.234 --> 18:33.403
But, Sensei, you already get a point
for hitting the chest.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.989
Why go for extra damage?

18:36.573 --> 18:39.118
Because the shortest distance
to victory in a fight

18:40.035 --> 18:41.954
is to take out your opponent
with one shot.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
[ominous music plays]

18:46.083 --> 18:47.292
[exhales]

18:48.001 --> 18:49.253
Show me again.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.338
[suspenseful music plays]

18:59.888 --> 19:00.889
Look at this place.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.766
Whoa!

19:03.642 --> 19:06.103
Whoa. It's like a Cobra starship.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.523
They even got a smoothie bar. No fair!

19:19.867 --> 19:21.994

19:33.589 --> 19:34.423
[Kim] Nichols.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.049
Come here.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.553
You beat the LaRusso girl before.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.471
Make this fight quick.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.936
[tense music plays]

19:52.691 --> 19:53.525
[scoffs]

19:58.447 --> 20:00.199
-Keene!
-[tense music continues]

20:01.742 --> 20:05.120
That's some messed up shit.
You training the kid who bullied me.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.124
-Heard you're doing the bullying now.
-He deserves everything that comes to him.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.375
Don't think you believe that.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.712
I know how things can start from nothing

20:13.795 --> 20:16.006
and get bigger and bigger
until all you feel is hate.

20:16.089 --> 20:16.924
I've been there.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.889
But I'm telling you,
it is so much better to let that hate go.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.559
You and Anthony might actually get along
if you got to know each other.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.770
Yeah, right.
He made my life a living hell.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.731
He's the reason
I came to you in the first place.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.528
You know what?
You're lucky you're not on the mat today.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.114
Guess Hawk will have to do.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.665
Don't worry. I'll shut him up.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.083
Don't go too hard on him.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.211
You remember what it's like to be
in Cobra Kai. It's not Kenny talking.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.296
It's Silver.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.924
Yeah.

20:59.007 --> 21:02.135
Thank you, Sensei Silver, for offering
to host these matches in your dojo

21:02.219 --> 21:03.470
on such short notice.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.764
Offering or demanding?

21:05.847 --> 21:08.767
We do have actual
tournament regulation mats here,

21:08.850 --> 21:11.186
so it really was the only option.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.355
[Gunther] We'll begin with the boys.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.817
We have invited a local referee
to ensure impartiality.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.529
First to three points wins.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.322
[tense music plays]

21:24.157 --> 21:25.075
Time to begin.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.871
Eli Moskowitz and Kenny Payne,

21:30.747 --> 21:31.748
please take the mat.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.545

21:36.628 --> 21:37.462
Face me.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.464
Bow.

21:40.007 --> 21:40.841
Face each other.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.301

21:42.384 --> 21:43.218

-[referee] Out of bounds.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.377
-No point.
-What? What, are you serious?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.880
Ref, that's horseshit.
He made contact in bounds!

22:19.963 --> 22:21.715
No point. Back on the line.

-[Hawk groans]

22:46.907 --> 22:47.908
[referee] Illegal strike.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.535
That's a warning.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.413
-Turn and kneel.
-Warning? He should be disqualified.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.290
It's fine. He just caught me off-guard.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.416
Are you sure, Eli?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.293
No more Eli.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.754
It's time to uncage the Hawk.

-[referee] Get back on the line.

Hawk. What's wrong?

23:45.132 --> 23:47.342
I can't… Can't… Can't breathe.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.469
Can you continue?

23:53.974 --> 23:54.933
Where's the medic?

23:55.976 --> 23:59.104
That's a forfeit. Winner, Payne.

23:59.938 --> 24:00.814
What?

[cheering]

24:06.236 --> 24:07.446
[medic] Can you breathe?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.907
I think he's okay.
Just got the wind knocked out of him.
