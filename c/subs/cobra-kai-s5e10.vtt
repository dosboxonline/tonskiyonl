I should be able to bypass it.

Spoken like a man that's done this before.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.937
Karate wasn't my first hobby.
I fractured a law or two before we met.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.730
Or we could just scan my key card.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.568

keep from, you know, violating it.

[Hawk] What's happening?

11:35.695 --> 11:39.573

-It's fine. She's with us.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.624
-For what we're about to do at least.
-So what are we doing?

11:48.708 --> 11:52.712
All your text says is that we're gonna
take down Cobra Kai. But how exactly?

11:52.795 --> 11:56.340
Gonna show them who their sensei is.
We think we have proof he's a criminal.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.802
We're going upstairs to Silver's office.
We need you downstairs as lookout.

-Yeah.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.394
[Hawk] We upload the clip
to the YouTube channel,

12:08.477 --> 12:10.104
and Cobra Kai is out of business.

12:10.187 --> 12:14.608
Okay. Stingray's assault happened
the morning after prom.

It was supposed to be yours, but, uh--

40:30.261 --> 40:33.055
But I broke up with you
before you could give it to me.

So you weren't really fine
with breaking up?

40:38.144 --> 40:39.937
