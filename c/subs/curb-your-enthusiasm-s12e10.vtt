WEBVTT

00:13.698 --> 00:16.265
Seat backs up,
fasten your seatbelts.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.533
Let me get your seat back.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.301
This needs to go up.
And fasten your seatbelt, sir.

00:19.301 --> 00:20.535
- Seatbelt?
- Yeah.

00:20.535 --> 00:22.438
Just more government
interference.

00:22.438 --> 00:24.206
Next thing you know,
they won't let me have

00:24.206 --> 00:25.274
an abortion on the plane.

00:25.274 --> 00:27.076
Oh, okay. I'm glad I could help.

00:27.076 --> 00:28.411
Um, and, sir, if you just wanna

00:28.411 --> 00:30.278
- close your laptop there.
- Oh, yeah.

00:30.278 --> 00:32.213
- And then if you just wanna
turn your phone off. Thanks.
- Sure. Yeah. Okay. Got it.

00:32.213 --> 00:33.981
<i>At this time we ask you
to fasten all seatbelts</i>

00:33.981 --> 00:36.113
<i>and turn off
all electronic devices
as we prepare for takeoff.</i>

00:36.113 --> 00:37.486
Hey, Larr.
What's up with Lewis?

00:37.486 --> 00:39.255
I thought he was coming to
Atlanta with us for the trial.

00:39.255 --> 00:40.822
Oh, no.
He left two days earlier.

00:40.822 --> 00:42.157
- So he's there now?
- Yeah.

00:42.157 --> 00:43.625
He went out with this woman
30 years ago.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.327
They broke up.
She lives in Atlanta now,

00:45.327 --> 00:46.462
so he's gonna see her.

00:46.462 --> 00:48.164
- Rekindling?
- Rekindling.

00:48.164 --> 00:49.631
I hope it works out for him.

00:49.631 --> 00:51.769
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure it's gonna work out.

00:52.536 --> 00:53.869
Larry, when we get in the air,

00:53.869 --> 00:55.838
I'm gonna watch
your little show <i>Seinfeld.</i>

00:55.838 --> 00:58.202
- Never seen it.
- Oh, yeah? It's about time.

00:58.202 --> 01:00.475
I'm gonna watch that shit.
I'll tell you how it is.

01:00.475 --> 01:02.445
I'm not really interested
in your opinion.

01:02.445 --> 01:05.147
- What do you mean?
- I don't consider you a person.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.216
We'll see.

01:13.391 --> 01:14.789
- Excuse me, sir?
- Oh.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.991
Someone let me know
that your phone is still on.

01:16.991 --> 01:19.595
We need to put that on
airplane mode or stow it away.

01:19.595 --> 01:20.862
Who would do
something like that?

01:20.862 --> 01:22.898
I'm not gonna disclose that.
And your seatbelt's off.

01:22.898 --> 01:25.034
- But why won't you tell me?
- Why would I tell you?

01:25.034 --> 01:26.302
Because I'd like to know

01:26.302 --> 01:27.871
if there's a squealer
on this plane.

01:27.871 --> 01:28.770
I'd like to know who it is.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.439
I'm not comfortable flying
with a squealer.

01:30.439 --> 01:32.208
Sir, you're not comfortable
with a squealer

01:32.208 --> 01:33.442
yet you're asking me to squeal?

01:33.442 --> 01:34.878
That's a different
kind of squealing.

01:34.878 --> 01:36.279
It seems very hypocritical.

01:36.279 --> 01:37.412
I could see on its face that

01:37.412 --> 01:38.547
- it does seem that way.
- Okay.

01:38.547 --> 01:39.847
But if you examine it,
it's really not.

01:39.847 --> 01:42.017
I'm not gonna squeal
on the squealer, okay?

01:42.017 --> 01:44.353
- And let's keep that phone off.
- Okay. Sure. Yeah.

01:44.353 --> 01:46.522
- Thank you. Good job. Thank you.
- I got it. Yeah.

01:46.522 --> 01:48.322
Okay.

01:48.322 --> 01:50.359
<i>We apologize for the delay.
We are next in line for takeoff.</i>

01:50.359 --> 01:51.694
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.</i>

01:51.694 --> 01:53.595
Sir? Sir, we need you
to buckle up.

01:53.595 --> 01:55.163
- Huh? What? Huh?
- We need you to buckle up.

01:55.163 --> 01:57.099
- Oh, yeah. No, no.
I was just-- Yeah.
- I know what you were doing.

01:57.099 --> 01:59.501
- Okay. Just gonna stay seated.
Okay?
- Okay.

01:59.501 --> 02:01.570
Hey, you told her
that I was on the phone?

02:01.570 --> 02:03.839
- How dare you
accuse me of squealing?
- Huh? Just asking.

02:03.839 --> 02:05.874
I'm schlepping all the way
to fuckin' Atlanta

02:05.874 --> 02:08.677
to support you,
on my anniversary, no less.

02:08.677 --> 02:10.340
It still doesn't mean
you couldn't have done it,

02:10.340 --> 02:11.680
- even if you are coming
to support me.
- Oh, please.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.215
I have better things to do
than squeal on you.

02:13.215 --> 02:15.518
Well, it's about plane safety.
I'm sure you're interested
in that.

02:15.518 --> 02:16.652
I don't give a shit.

02:16.652 --> 02:18.687
You tell her about my phone?
Was that you?

02:18.687 --> 02:20.723
- You think I did that shit?
- Everyone's a suspect.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.725
- You think I'm a fuckin' snitch?
- I don't think you're above it.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.194
- Oh. It's like that?
- Yeah. It's like that.

02:25.194 --> 02:26.362
Why would I draw attention

02:26.362 --> 02:28.930
when I got
my own fucking phone on?

02:28.930 --> 02:31.066
- Your phone's on?
- Fuck yeah, my phone is on.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.035
- His phone's on.
- His phone, sir?

02:33.035 --> 02:35.471
- Check it out. Check it out.
- Come on. Really?

02:35.471 --> 02:36.638
Look at his phone.
Look at his phone.

02:36.638 --> 02:38.207
You're squealing on someone now?

02:38.207 --> 02:41.444
Yeah, he's endangering the rest
of the passengers. He is.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.044
Okay. Okay.
Look, it came back on by itself.

02:43.044 --> 02:45.380
- Please turn that off.
- No. He left-- he left it on.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.919
And is your phone now off?

02:47.586 --> 02:48.583
Yes.

02:48.583 --> 02:51.757
Show her. Show your phone.
Show it to her.

02:52.156 --> 02:53.555
Oh, my God. Oh.

02:53.555 --> 02:55.424
- I thought I turned it off.
- That's on.

02:55.424 --> 02:56.592
Can you turn that
onto airplane mode?

02:56.592 --> 02:58.460
- Sure. Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

02:58.460 --> 02:59.729
Larry. Larry.

02:59.729 --> 03:00.866
Yeah?

03:03.134 --> 03:04.233
This guy back here.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.869
What?

03:05.869 --> 03:07.236
Oh, it-- it flipped on.

03:07.236 --> 03:08.470
Why would you do that to me?

03:08.470 --> 03:09.838
Passenger safety.

03:09.838 --> 03:12.608
You're dealing with three
very disturbed individuals here.

03:12.608 --> 03:14.877
Thank you. Everyone,
the plane is taxiing, okay?

03:14.877 --> 03:16.880
I need your phones
to be off or stowed

03:16.880 --> 03:18.247
and seatbelts fastened.

03:18.247 --> 03:19.885
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:22.418 --> 03:24.253
- That's bullshit.
- That's some bullshit.

03:24.253 --> 03:25.958
That's that bullshit.

03:30.394 --> 03:31.426
<i>I watched a few, uh,</i>

03:31.426 --> 03:32.961
Seinfeld <i>episodes
on the plane and shit.</i>

03:32.961 --> 03:36.465
You never told me
it was a show about weekly ass.

03:36.465 --> 03:37.933
It's not a show
about weekly ass.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.835
Jerry just constantly
got ass every week.

03:39.835 --> 03:41.503
You know what I thought it was
from the beginning?

03:41.503 --> 03:43.306
I said, "This ain't a fucking,
uh, TV show."

03:43.306 --> 03:44.941
"This is more
of a fuck documentary."

03:44.941 --> 03:46.475
That's what it felt like.

03:46.475 --> 03:48.644
Yeah, man. And how do you
fuck that much, man?

03:48.644 --> 03:50.679
It's like you need--
you need, like, extra dicks.

03:50.679 --> 03:52.581
Like-- Like you got
your own dick,

03:52.581 --> 03:54.316
but then you gotta have
a backup dick.

03:54.316 --> 03:55.584
A dick should be
interchangeable.

03:55.584 --> 03:56.951
Yeah. Like a pair of glasses.

03:56.951 --> 03:58.620
- It should be like
a pair of glasses.
- Yeah!

03:58.620 --> 04:00.322
You could put one on
in the morning.

04:00.322 --> 04:01.657
Yeah. Quick,
put that motherfucker on.

04:01.657 --> 04:03.392
That way, you ain't wearing out
your original dick.

04:03.392 --> 04:05.494
Like when a lady say,
"Oh, more, more."

04:05.494 --> 04:06.629
"Oh, you want more?

04:06.629 --> 04:07.763
Oh, I-- I'm-- I'mma take
my other dick

04:07.763 --> 04:09.665
out my back pocket."

04:09.665 --> 04:11.667
- See that?
- Right.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.536
Oh. Oh. There's our exit.

04:15.771 --> 04:17.740
Hey, she's not--
She won't let me in.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.508
Hey, let me in. Let me in!

04:19.508 --> 04:20.943
Can we get over?

04:20.943 --> 04:25.214
Hey! Can we get in?
Hey! What's wrong with you?

04:25.214 --> 04:26.548
We're trying to get in!

04:26.548 --> 04:27.750
She's speeding up!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.352
We wanna get off the highway!

04:29.352 --> 04:32.154
Are you kidding me?
What is with this woman?

04:32.154 --> 04:33.559
Won't let us in!

04:35.822 --> 04:38.631
Oh, shit!

04:39.030 --> 04:40.529
Fuck you too!

04:40.529 --> 04:42.531
What?
I just wanna get in!

04:42.531 --> 04:44.270
What kind of person
does something like that?

04:44.736 --> 04:46.038
Fuck you!

04:49.872 --> 04:52.309
Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

04:52.309 --> 04:53.743
Whoo!

04:53.743 --> 04:56.745
Mr. David, pulling for you, man.

04:56.745 --> 04:58.876
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- You got it, brother.

04:58.876 --> 04:59.848
Look at you, man.

04:59.848 --> 05:01.684
Most popular White man
in America right now.

05:01.684 --> 05:03.352
You don't have to buy
a pack of Kools

05:03.352 --> 05:05.121
for the rest of your life.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.323
- Excellent.
- I'll be back.

05:07.623 --> 05:09.424
Oh, my gosh.

05:09.424 --> 05:10.659
Preston, come here.

05:10.659 --> 05:13.662
- I am so sorry, sir. No--
- Hey, that's fine.

05:13.662 --> 05:14.996
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:14.996 --> 05:18.367
Okay. Preston, what do we say
when we hurt somebody?

05:18.367 --> 05:19.668
It-- it's okay.
It didn't hurt me at all.

05:19.668 --> 05:21.102
No, no, no.
Just one more second. No, no.

05:21.102 --> 05:22.938
- Come on.
We just talked about this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:22.938 --> 05:25.241
- Okay? We say I'm... s...
- Okay, I-- I--

05:25.241 --> 05:26.308
Uh...

05:26.308 --> 05:28.377
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- I'm...

05:28.377 --> 05:30.979
Please don't help him out.
I want him to learn this. Okay?

05:30.979 --> 05:33.416
- All right. We're good.
Thank you.
- No, no, no. We're not done yet.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.749
We're gonna learn
this lesson here,

05:34.749 --> 05:36.119
'cause this is a really
important lesson.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.121
Hey, hey. We don't have
to learn the lesson,

05:38.121 --> 05:39.555
but I'll tell you what.

05:39.555 --> 05:40.990
If you want me to participate
in this lesson...

05:40.990 --> 05:43.120
- Yeah.
- Okay. Here's my two cents.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.094
Okay. Great. Listen to the man.

05:45.094 --> 05:50.099
I'm 76 years old and I have
never learned a lesson

05:50.099 --> 05:52.835
in my entire life.

05:52.835 --> 05:53.870
Oh-ho!

05:53.870 --> 05:55.370
- Do you think that's helping?
- I do.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.677
That's who we don't wanna be
like, okay? Come on. Let's go.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.844
<i>The trial of
the State of Georgia</i>

06:01.844 --> 06:04.007
<i>versus Larry David
is underway...</i>

06:04.007 --> 06:06.781
- You're kidding me.
<i>- ...with jury selection
beginning tomorrow.</i>

06:06.781 --> 06:09.519
Could you do me a favor?
Could you put on ESPN please?

06:09.519 --> 06:10.585
Thank you.

06:10.585 --> 06:11.886
So why don't you
wanna come with us?

06:11.886 --> 06:13.222
We're going
to Auntie Rae's restaurant.

06:13.222 --> 06:15.024
- It's supposed to be great.
- I know. Send her my love.

06:15.024 --> 06:17.693
But I'm here to see,
you know, Cynthia.

06:17.693 --> 06:19.362
We're getting along great.

06:19.362 --> 06:20.729
In bed, everything is cool.

06:20.729 --> 06:22.131
- We're still great lovers.
- Ugh.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.866
What are you--
Why are you annoyed?

06:23.866 --> 06:25.434
- You can't-- Why can't you--
- That's TMI.

06:25.434 --> 06:26.635
- We don't wanna hear that.
- Why? What is--

06:26.635 --> 06:28.870
'Cause it's a--
It's a picture of you, uh...

06:28.870 --> 06:31.073
- No, no!
- You don't have to picture me.
Picture her!

06:31.073 --> 06:32.441
We don't wanna picture that.

06:32.441 --> 06:33.742
- Why can't I--
- No. Please, no.

06:33.742 --> 06:36.078
I'd rather picture my parents
naked than you naked.

06:36.078 --> 06:38.081
- Don't mention
intercourse anymore.
- Really.

06:38.081 --> 06:39.352
A little bit nauseous.

06:40.285 --> 06:41.585
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what's up?

06:41.585 --> 06:42.918
Hey, man.

06:42.918 --> 06:44.087
- Scotch.
- So you guys--

06:44.087 --> 06:46.788
It sounds like you were,
like, madly in love.

06:46.788 --> 06:49.258
We were deeply in love.
- Wow.

06:49.258 --> 06:52.394
In fact, so much in love
that when I broke up with her,

06:52.394 --> 06:54.333
- she attempted suicide.
- Ooh.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.665
- Really?
- What?

06:56.665 --> 06:58.868
You're telling me
that if she can't have you,

06:58.868 --> 07:01.169
- she'd rather be dead?
- I guess so.

07:01.169 --> 07:02.971
You know, sometimes
when you break up with someone,

07:02.971 --> 07:06.142
to get pity, they say
they attempted suicide

07:06.142 --> 07:07.643
so the person
will go back with them.

07:07.643 --> 07:09.145
- It's manipulative.
- It's manipulative. Yeah.

07:09.145 --> 07:11.013
Wait a minute. You're doubting
her suicide attempt?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.581
You think
you're suicide material?

07:12.581 --> 07:14.050
- Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
- Really?

07:14.050 --> 07:15.852
- Richard.
- Hi, beautiful.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.253
- Hi.
- Good to see you, baby.

07:17.253 --> 07:19.255
- Good to see you, too.
- This must be Cynthia.

07:19.255 --> 07:20.389
- It sure is.
- Yes.

07:20.389 --> 07:21.557
- Hi.
- Hi. Susie.

07:21.557 --> 07:23.558
- Susie, nice to meet you.
- My husband, Jeff.

07:23.558 --> 07:25.261
- Hi, Jeff.
- Pleasure.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.762
- Hey.
- It's a pleasure
to meet you.

07:26.762 --> 07:27.763
And Larry. You know Larry.

07:27.763 --> 07:29.030
- It's her.
- Yeah.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.833
Yeah, Larry's over here.
Big shot Larry on the news.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.734
- Larry. Yes.
- Hello.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.236
- And his friend Leon.
- Hi. Yeah.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.438
- Hey, how you doin'?
- I'm good. How are you?

07:36.438 --> 07:37.473
Nice to meet you.

07:37.473 --> 07:40.575
I think we met
earlier today, actually.

07:40.575 --> 07:42.778
On I-85.
I was trying to get over

07:42.778 --> 07:44.113
to the exit.
Yeah.

07:44.113 --> 07:47.916
And, uh, you wouldn't--
you wouldn't let me in.

07:47.916 --> 07:51.054
What-- I don't think I--
Doesn't sound like me.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.823
- Do you have a blue Mercedes?
- I do.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.624
- Huh.
- But it wasn't me.

07:55.624 --> 07:58.628
I wasn't even on I-85 today.
So you just--

07:58.628 --> 08:00.697
You weren't on I-85 today?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.431
I was not on I-85 today.

08:02.431 --> 08:05.334
You know, this is exciting to
hear this <i>Highway Patrol</i> story,

08:05.334 --> 08:07.468
but we're gonna go eat dinner
and have some time...

08:07.468 --> 08:10.606
That's right. Enjoy dinner.

08:10.606 --> 08:13.141
- Say hello to Auntie Rae.
- Enjoy your evening.
It was very nice to meet you.

08:13.141 --> 08:16.145
Thanks for everything.
Both of you.

08:16.145 --> 08:18.013
All right, guys. We gotta go.
We have a reservation.

08:18.013 --> 08:20.082
I know the <i>Highway Patrol</i> theme.
I was singing it.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.583
Go.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.052
That's wonderful, Larr.

08:23.052 --> 08:24.553
If you need anything else,
let me know.

08:24.553 --> 08:25.788
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:25.788 --> 08:27.022
- Hi, guys.
- Hello, Cheryl.

08:27.022 --> 08:28.623
How's it going?

08:28.623 --> 08:29.792
- You just got here?
- Yeah.

08:29.792 --> 08:31.059
Wanna come to dinner with us?

08:31.059 --> 08:33.095
We're going to Auntie Rae's.
It's gonna be delicious.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.897
- Oh. No, I'm waiting for Ted.
- Oh.

08:34.897 --> 08:36.132
He's finishing up an interview

08:36.132 --> 08:37.934
because he's protesting
tomorrow.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.969
- Oh, okay.
- On your behalf.

08:39.969 --> 08:42.371
No, he's protesting
on his behalf.

08:42.371 --> 08:45.908
He's not gonna stand by
and let people be mistreated.

08:45.908 --> 08:47.844
He's not gonna stand by
off camera

08:47.844 --> 08:49.045
and let people be mistreated.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.780
Okay. Anyway, we're gonna go
to dinner after.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.949
Do you know
of any good places around here?

08:53.949 --> 08:56.152
Oh, oh. The Mexican place.

08:56.152 --> 08:57.653
Oh, that place is good,
La Conde.

08:57.653 --> 08:58.955
No, no.
She doesn't like Mexican food.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.555
- No?
- No.

09:00.555 --> 09:02.457
Well, you go to the left
and there's like
a million restaurants.

09:02.457 --> 09:04.493
- We better go, guys,
because you know Auntie Rae.
- All right. Let's go.

09:04.493 --> 09:05.761
You cannot be late
for Auntie Rae.

09:05.761 --> 09:08.066
- See you later, Cher.
- Okay. Yeah. Hey. Excuse me.

09:08.934 --> 09:10.336
Why would you say that?

09:10.802 --> 09:11.967
Huh? Say what?

09:11.967 --> 09:14.236
That I don't like...
...Mexican food.

09:14.236 --> 09:15.938
Well, you don't like
Mexican food.

09:15.938 --> 09:18.241
Don't say it in front of people.

09:18.241 --> 09:20.944
- I told you that in confidence.
- What? Confidence?

09:20.944 --> 09:23.412
I don't know
what your problem with it is.

09:23.412 --> 09:24.213
Because it's personal to me.

09:24.213 --> 09:25.847
- No, that's not personal.
- It is.

09:25.847 --> 09:28.618
Telling people
what sexual positions you like,

09:28.618 --> 09:29.952
that would be personal.

09:29.952 --> 09:32.855
- Just keep it to yourself.
- You don't like funnel cake.

09:32.855 --> 09:34.623
Is it okay
if I tell people that?

09:34.623 --> 09:35.790
- Yes.
- You didn't like the remake

09:35.790 --> 09:37.426
of <i>The Fugitive</i>
with Harrison Ford.

09:37.426 --> 09:38.931
- Can I tell people that?
- Yes.

09:39.263 --> 09:40.262
Okay.

09:40.262 --> 09:42.397
- I won't tell anybody else...
- Thank you.

09:42.397 --> 09:45.268
...that you don't
like Mexican food.

09:45.268 --> 09:46.769
Thank you.

09:46.769 --> 09:49.438
- Are you okay?
- I am.

09:49.438 --> 09:51.344
- I'm not so sure.
- Okay.

09:59.982 --> 10:01.951
She won't let us in.
She sped up.

10:01.951 --> 10:04.420
And no doubt that it was her.
Was it not?

10:04.420 --> 10:06.222
- It was her.
- Huh? She gave us the finger.

10:06.222 --> 10:08.990
We gave her the finger.
Terrible, terrible person.

10:08.990 --> 10:11.394
You know what? I'm--
I'm gonna say something to him.

10:11.394 --> 10:13.663
Oh, don't tell--
Larry, don't be a buttinski

10:13.663 --> 10:15.030
and start telling Richard.

10:15.030 --> 10:16.900
Let him have his illusions,
whatever they are.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.167
You never learn your lesson.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.736
- I don't learn my lesson?
- No, you do not.

10:20.736 --> 10:22.438
When have you ever
learned a lesson?

10:22.438 --> 10:23.538
Okay, I'll tell you when. Okay.

10:23.538 --> 10:26.409
When I was 19 years old,
I was in a bar. I had a drink.

10:26.409 --> 10:28.944
And I looked at the bartender
and I said to him,

10:28.944 --> 10:30.346
"Hey, Captain,
I'll have another,"

10:30.346 --> 10:32.948
and he gave me
like the dirtiest look.

10:32.948 --> 10:35.412
And I've never called
anybody captain since.

10:35.412 --> 10:36.652
Why would you call him captain?

10:36.652 --> 10:38.987
What do you mean why?
You've never called
anybody captain?

10:38.987 --> 10:40.923
Not captain, but I did call
a motherfucker chief,

10:40.923 --> 10:42.791
and then realized
he was a real Indian and shit.

10:42.791 --> 10:47.429
All right. We've got
four Rae's Special Salads.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.397
- Here you go.
- Whoo!

10:48.397 --> 10:49.965
- Thank you.
- Oh, I also brought y'all

10:49.965 --> 10:52.101
some extra salad dressing,
because y'all are gonna love it.

10:52.101 --> 10:53.368
- Hoowee!
- Y'all need anything else?

10:53.368 --> 10:54.731
I think we're good.
Thank you very much.

10:54.731 --> 10:56.038
- All right.
- Good. Thank you.

10:56.038 --> 10:57.606
- Oh, my God.
- You're welcome.

10:57.606 --> 10:58.775
Oh, my God.
This is so delicious.

10:58.775 --> 11:00.241
What is in this that's so good?

11:00.241 --> 11:02.745
- It's great.
- This is the best dressing
I've ever had.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.346
It's really good.
I agree with you.

11:04.346 --> 11:06.048
Oh, my God.
If I had this recipe,

11:06.048 --> 11:09.351
I would make salads every day,
I'd be losing weight like crazy.

11:09.351 --> 11:11.354
- Mm, really good.
- Auntie Rae!

11:11.354 --> 11:12.449
- Hey!
- Hey!

11:12.449 --> 11:13.589
I hope y'all having a good time.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.191
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me tell you something,
Auntie Rae,

11:15.191 --> 11:18.227
this is the best salad dressing
I've ever had in my life.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.362
I'm happy
that you like it, baby.

11:20.362 --> 11:23.098
And I would love to be able
to make it back in LA.

11:23.098 --> 11:24.500
So what's the deal?
What's in it?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.202
Well, you know, baby,
I'm glad you're enjoying it,

11:27.202 --> 11:30.539
but that's one recipe
that they can't pull out of me.

11:30.539 --> 11:31.907
- Oh, come on.
- No.

11:31.907 --> 11:34.176
- Even for you, baby, I don't do.
- Oh, damn.

11:34.176 --> 11:37.046
Mm-mm.
That's just the way it is.

11:37.046 --> 11:39.948
Mic drop!

11:39.948 --> 11:41.350
So, I'll see y'all
in a little bit, all right?

11:41.350 --> 11:44.153
What is in this?
It's so fucking good.

11:47.793 --> 11:48.924
Well, well, well.

11:48.924 --> 11:51.493
I feel like I won
the jury lottery today.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.996
I look around here and I see
nothing but good people.

11:54.996 --> 11:57.767
I can envision having y'all over
on a Sunday after church

11:57.767 --> 12:00.135
for a little barbecue sometime.

12:00.135 --> 12:02.938
Earl Mack. He's good.
He's really good.

12:02.938 --> 12:06.175
But the circumstances today
call for this question.

12:06.175 --> 12:10.847
Who here could see themselves
stealing a loaf of bread

12:10.847 --> 12:13.419
in order to feed
a hungry stranger?

12:13.785 --> 12:15.484
Yeah?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.523
I ask they're all dismissed
for cause.

12:18.524 --> 12:19.658
Dismissed.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.090
Damn it.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.928
- I wanted some of those jurors.
- Yeah. No, she was good.

12:24.928 --> 12:26.195
Defense,
you're up.

12:26.195 --> 12:28.962
- Thank you, Judge.
- Oh, wait. I have some thoughts.

12:29.634 --> 12:30.599
What?

12:30.599 --> 12:32.267
All right.

12:32.267 --> 12:34.336
That guy's got a string tie him.
Let's get rid of him.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.706
No liberal would be caught dead
in a string tie.

12:36.706 --> 12:38.941
Juror number 20, thank you.

12:38.941 --> 12:40.076
Dismissed.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.711
Not loving 22. Big hair.

12:42.711 --> 12:45.447
Shades of Kellyanne Conway.
No good.

12:45.447 --> 12:46.815
Juror 22, dismissed.

12:46.815 --> 12:49.885
- Forty.
That's a Fox watcher.
- Dismissed.

12:49.885 --> 12:51.186
Twenty-three.

12:51.186 --> 12:53.522
You see that comb over?
He's a self-loathing bald man!

12:53.522 --> 12:55.758
He hates himself
and he hates other bald men.

12:55.758 --> 12:58.027
- He's gotta go.
- Okay.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.597
Juror 23, dismissed.

13:02.498 --> 13:04.300
Uh, members of the jury,

13:04.300 --> 13:06.802
as you know, there's lots
of publicity around this case.

13:06.802 --> 13:11.310
As you see the cameras outside,
there's intense media scrutiny.

13:12.343 --> 13:14.110
So we're gonna have
to sequester you.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.578
I know, I know.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.748
We'll give you a nice hotel,
try to make you comfortable.

13:18.748 --> 13:20.082
Oh, sequestering. That's awful.

13:20.082 --> 13:21.317
No watching TV,
no listening to the radio...

13:21.317 --> 13:22.584
I would hate to be
cooped up like that.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.586
I don't think I could take it,
you know?

13:24.586 --> 13:26.522
And I'll bet a lot of them
cheat on it too.

13:26.522 --> 13:28.523
There's probably
a bad sequesterer among them.

13:28.523 --> 13:31.060
- Don't you think?
- Larry, I wouldn't worry
about the jury.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.261
You're the defendant.

13:32.261 --> 13:34.931
And if you get convicted,
you'll be a felon.

13:39.536 --> 13:40.836
<i>Dragnet.</i>

13:40.836 --> 13:43.036
Tomorrow,
the lawyers will give
their opening arguments.

13:43.775 --> 13:46.108
Court adjourned.

13:46.108 --> 13:49.045
<i>It is day one of the trial
of Larry David,</i>

13:49.045 --> 13:51.213
<i>the</i> Seinfeld <i>co-creator
who's run afoul...</i>

13:51.213 --> 13:53.843
- Is that for Larry?
<i>- ...of the new Georgia

13:53.843 --> 13:56.319
<i>that he views

13:56.319 --> 13:58.287
<i>- and unconstitutional.</i>
- Thank you very much.

13:58.287 --> 14:01.658
<i>How this plays out
could have major ramifications</i>

14:01.658 --> 14:03.092
<i>for the next election.</i>

14:03.092 --> 14:04.628
- Keep it close.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:04.628 --> 14:05.798
Thank you.

14:06.998 --> 14:09.699
- Hi.
- Hi, Larry.

14:09.699 --> 14:11.467
You got that blue Mercedes, huh?

14:11.467 --> 14:14.036
- Yeah. Nice car.
- Oh, very nice.

14:14.036 --> 14:16.138
That's the exact model
of the car

14:16.138 --> 14:18.374
that wouldn't let me
into the lane.

14:18.374 --> 14:21.210
- That's right. I remember...
- And a woman was driving.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.112
- Huh!
- But it wasn't me.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.384
- What a crazy coincidence.
- Yeah.

14:25.984 --> 14:28.745
So, um, Richard told me

14:28.745 --> 14:31.921
that you once
contemplated, uh,

14:31.921 --> 14:36.520
dare I say, attempted suicide?

14:36.520 --> 14:37.827
Richard told you that?

14:37.827 --> 14:39.128
Yes. Yes.
We're very close.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.064
I tell him everything.
He tells me everything. Yeah.

14:42.064 --> 14:43.766
Yes, I did, Larry.

14:43.766 --> 14:45.134
Why did you do it?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.370
Oh, it was the whole...
the breakup?

14:47.370 --> 14:49.672
It was a very
emotional time for me.

14:49.672 --> 14:50.873
- I was...
- Hmm.

14:50.873 --> 14:52.175
...very much in love with him

14:52.175 --> 14:54.076
- and--
- Him?

14:54.076 --> 14:56.412
- You're Richard's friend?
- Yeah.

14:56.412 --> 14:59.483
And you don't believe anyone
could be in love with him?

14:59.483 --> 15:00.950
No.

15:00.950 --> 15:03.218
Have you ever known love, Larry?

15:03.218 --> 15:05.354
Have you ever known
the loss of a great love?

15:05.354 --> 15:07.722
Oh, I've known love
and I've known loss.

15:07.722 --> 15:12.028
2004, Yankees lost the last
four games to the hated Red Sox.

15:12.028 --> 15:13.496
Devastated for weeks.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.732
Felt like killing myself, actually.

15:15.732 --> 15:17.166
Different kind of love, Larry.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.504
And in 1994, of course,
when the Rangers won the Cup.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.040
Come on. Doesn't get
any better than that.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.342
When Messier
lofted that trophy,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.144
I thought my heart
was gonna burst.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.213
Larry, I was in love
with Richard. I made a choice.

15:31.213 --> 15:34.316
I'm-- I-- I was emotionally
distraught.

15:34.316 --> 15:36.653
And, yes, I did attempt suicide.

15:36.653 --> 15:37.854
How did you do it?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.221
I think you're the first person

15:39.221 --> 15:41.124
who has ever asked me
that question, Larry.

15:41.124 --> 15:42.658
- Really?
- So inappropriate.

15:42.658 --> 15:44.627
You know, you're right.
It would be inappropriate,

15:44.627 --> 15:47.696
if in fact the person actually
attempted suicide.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.366
Oh, so you're saying you don't
believe I attempted suicide?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.734
- How'd you do it?
- I don't remember.

15:51.734 --> 15:53.672
- It was long time ago.
- You don't remember?

15:54.205 --> 15:56.205
Pills, okay?

15:56.205 --> 15:57.543
What kind of pills?

15:58.710 --> 16:01.175
Pink pills.

16:01.913 --> 16:04.680
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

16:16.795 --> 16:17.796
Okay.

16:18.858 --> 16:21.500
Tell Richard I'll be in the car.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.838
Hey, what are you doing sitting
with your back to the door?

16:29.838 --> 16:32.907
Because of my fans.
They just swarm all over me.

16:32.907 --> 16:35.511
Really? You're kind of like
a Beatle in a way, aren't you?

16:35.511 --> 16:36.879
- Can you spread that around?
- Yeah.

16:36.879 --> 16:39.915
Hey, Cynthia, she's waiting
in the car for you.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.717
What do you mean? No,
she's gonna meet me in here.

16:41.717 --> 16:44.487
No, no. I had a little...
I had a little thing with her.

16:44.487 --> 16:46.322
What do you mean?

16:46.322 --> 16:49.720
You know, I asked her
about the, uh, the suicide.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.060
Oh, Jesus Christ.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.631
The woman tried to hang herself.

16:53.431 --> 16:55.197
- Oh, she did?
- Yes.

16:55.197 --> 16:56.966
Well, isn't that curious.

16:56.966 --> 17:00.103
'Cause she told me
she took pills.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.803
Well, what's the difference,
pills, hanging?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.272
What's the difference?
What's the difference?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.573
You think somebody
would remember

17:04.573 --> 17:06.141
how they tried
to kill themselves.

17:06.141 --> 17:08.077
Why are you doing this
to me again?

17:08.077 --> 17:09.545
Ruining my potential wives,

17:09.545 --> 17:11.480
ruining my chance
to have children.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.682
- Jeez. Yeah. What?
- I want family.

17:13.682 --> 17:15.684
- How are you gonna do that?
- We'll adopt.

17:15.684 --> 17:17.587
What are you gonna adopt,
a 40-year-old?

17:17.587 --> 17:18.654
Yeah. A doctor.

17:18.654 --> 17:20.623
A doctor?
- A doctor or a lawyer.

17:20.623 --> 17:21.825
Good. Good idea.

17:21.825 --> 17:22.858
- Why not?
- Yeah. Why not?

17:22.858 --> 17:25.061
Well, you better go out.
She's waiting in the car.

17:25.061 --> 17:26.365
You better go out.

17:26.998 --> 17:28.031
Oh, God.

17:31.736 --> 17:33.936
Okay. You ready?

17:33.936 --> 17:35.671
No.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.609
Justice for Larry!

17:40.609 --> 17:43.048
Stop suppressing the vote!

17:44.148 --> 17:45.381
Stop suppressing the vote!

17:45.381 --> 17:47.716
Larry, care to comment
on the trial?

17:47.716 --> 17:49.885
- Can you hear the crowd? Yeah.
- Yes.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.186
Any comment? Larry.

17:51.186 --> 17:53.322
Stop suppressing the vote.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.790
Stop voter suppression!

17:55.790 --> 17:59.395
Stop-- Hold on.
Stop suppressing the vote.

17:59.395 --> 18:00.762
Stop voter suppression!

18:00.762 --> 18:02.331
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean
what am I doing?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.699
What are you doing?

18:03.699 --> 18:06.435
- I can't sit
this one out, Larry.
- Oh, really?

18:06.435 --> 18:09.205
Election Integrity Act?
It's bullshit.

18:09.205 --> 18:10.806
They're stealing votes.

18:10.806 --> 18:14.577
Yeah. You're stealing
the spotlight.

18:14.577 --> 18:16.712
By the way,
why are you telling everybody

18:16.712 --> 18:19.881
that Cheryl
doesn't like Mexican food?

18:19.881 --> 18:22.151
Telling everybody?
What, are you kidding?

18:22.151 --> 18:23.752
I told one person, and so what?

18:23.752 --> 18:25.288
It's not your story
to tell, Larry.

18:25.288 --> 18:27.122
There's no story.
It's not a story.

18:27.122 --> 18:29.425
- What's the shame
in not liking Mexican food?
- Just keep--

18:29.425 --> 18:31.627
- Keep your voice down.
- Why is that bad?

18:31.627 --> 18:33.795
Larry, we gotta go. We gotta go.

18:33.795 --> 18:35.097
- Good luck in there.
- Yeah.

18:35.097 --> 18:36.199
Hi, Mr. Danson.

18:37.599 --> 18:41.006
- Stop suppressing the vote.
- Stop voter suppression!

18:42.240 --> 18:44.040
- Earl.
- Morning, Counsel.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.110
Captain.

18:46.443 --> 18:48.177
Oh, my God.
Will you look at this?

18:48.177 --> 18:51.546
No coasters.

18:51.546 --> 18:53.515
They want you
to respect the law,

18:53.515 --> 18:56.352
but the law
doesn't respect wood.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.391
You see the irony there?

18:58.990 --> 19:00.155
Hey.

19:00.155 --> 19:01.490
Oh, hey.

19:01.490 --> 19:05.531
All rise. The honorable
Judge Whittaker presiding.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.362
Take your seats.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.233
Ready for
your opening statements?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.434
I am, Your Honor.

19:12.434 --> 19:14.203
Counselor, you may proceed.

19:14.203 --> 19:16.108
My grandfather...

19:17.241 --> 19:19.208
told me we are
a country of laws.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.343
That's all we are.

19:20.343 --> 19:23.278
You may not like
the Election Integrity Act,

19:23.278 --> 19:24.950
but that's not the point.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.317
Larry David broke the law.

19:28.317 --> 19:29.518
He's gonna admit that to you

19:29.518 --> 19:31.553
and I'm gonna bring up
a number of witnesses

19:31.553 --> 19:33.792
who are gonna show you
a pattern.

19:35.626 --> 19:37.393
It's not a very nice pattern.

19:37.393 --> 19:40.897
Because Larry David
doesn't respect the law.

19:40.897 --> 19:41.930
He lives outside.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.600
Unrestrained by the guardrails
of human decency.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.370
If we lived
by Larry David's code,

19:47.370 --> 19:48.403
you know what we'd have?

19:48.403 --> 19:50.709
Anarchy.
Who'd like anarchy here?

19:52.309 --> 19:53.376
He'd love it.

19:53.376 --> 19:56.345
Because that man wants
to burn it all down.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.012
I don't know
where he gets that from.

19:58.012 --> 20:01.550
Now, we have to dig deep
and ask ourselves today

20:01.550 --> 20:06.020
whether or not this man
deserves the right

20:06.020 --> 20:10.721
to walk freely among good,
decent, respectable people

20:10.721 --> 20:13.599
like you and me.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.432
Thank you, Counselor.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.234
Larry, you fucked!

20:18.234 --> 20:19.434
Shut the fuck up.

20:19.434 --> 20:21.270
- This motherfucker's good.
- Ms. Sanders?

20:21.270 --> 20:22.675
Yes, Judge.

20:24.175 --> 20:27.742
Did Larry David break the law?
Of course, he did.

20:27.742 --> 20:31.680
And yes, Larry is the one
who's on trial here.

20:31.680 --> 20:36.318
But Larry David is not the one
who should be on trial.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.921
It is this unconscionable,

20:38.921 --> 20:42.624
inhumane law
that should be on trial.

20:42.624 --> 20:45.461
You can't give
another human being water

20:45.461 --> 20:46.962
on a hot day?

20:46.962 --> 20:50.233
The district attorney will say
he broke the law.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.401
Case closed. Simple as that.

20:53.602 --> 20:57.772
But what if the law said
that Black people

20:57.772 --> 20:59.308
have to ride
in the back of the bus

20:59.308 --> 21:02.978
or that Jewish people have
to wear stars on their clothes?

21:02.978 --> 21:06.982
We know this law
is wrong.

21:06.982 --> 21:10.219
Its only purpose is
to scare people off from voting.

21:11.154 --> 21:14.090
It is an insult
to democracy

21:14.090 --> 21:19.062
and it goes against everything
the Bible tells us,

21:19.062 --> 21:20.799
what our parents taught us.

21:21.565 --> 21:22.968
Ask yourself this...

21:25.469 --> 21:26.802
what would Jesus do

21:26.802 --> 21:30.640
if he saw a line of people
sweltering in the heat,

21:30.640 --> 21:33.709
crying out for water?

21:33.709 --> 21:36.011
Would you convict Jesus?

21:36.011 --> 21:38.347
I think we all know
the answer to that.

21:39.482 --> 21:43.185
And if you
wouldn't convict Jesus...

21:43.185 --> 21:44.253
Ha!

21:44.253 --> 21:47.389
...then you can't convict Larry.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.626
Thank you.

21:50.626 --> 21:52.328
Thank you, Ms. Sanders.

21:52.328 --> 21:54.063
- Hey.
- We got 'em.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.931
Good job.

21:56.931 --> 21:59.268
<i>Is the state ready
to call its first witness?</i>

21:59.268 --> 22:01.804
The state calls Joe Boccabella.

22:01.804 --> 22:04.173
Who's Joe Boccabella?

22:04.173 --> 22:05.141
Oh, my God.

22:05.141 --> 22:08.510
That's not Joe Boccabella.
That's Mocha Joe.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.512
Mr. Boccabella,
I understand at one point,

22:10.512 --> 22:11.948
you were in the coffee business?

22:11.948 --> 22:14.117
Yes, I was.
It was called Mocha Joe's.

22:14.117 --> 22:14.951
Maybe you heard of it.

22:14.951 --> 22:16.451
Ever have
a problem with anybody?

22:16.451 --> 22:17.686
Not really. Normal stuff.

22:17.686 --> 22:21.390
Until one day
Larry David came in.

22:21.390 --> 22:22.626
Could you tell us what happened?

22:22.626 --> 22:23.725
He started complaining,

22:23.725 --> 22:25.594
my scones were like muffins,
too soft...

22:25.594 --> 22:26.929
Yeah. They were soft.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.165
...my tables were wobbly,
and that my coffee was cold,

22:29.165 --> 22:30.499
which it was not.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.101
- Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.
- No. Which it was. It was cold.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.737
- Goes to motivation, Your Honor.
- I'll allow it.

22:34.737 --> 22:36.070
And it ended there?

22:36.070 --> 22:39.075
I wish. He came back in
and he said he was opening up

22:39.075 --> 22:41.110
- what he called The Spite Store.
- Oh, here we go.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.073
A coffee shop, right next door

22:43.073 --> 22:44.580
to my store, Mocha Joe's.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.682
He was trying to put me
out of business.

22:46.682 --> 22:48.718
This almost
sounds fantastical.

22:48.718 --> 22:49.585
It got even worse.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.253
I got a call
in the middle of the night

22:51.253 --> 22:52.921
that Mocha Joe's was on fire.

22:52.921 --> 22:55.190
<i>And when I got there,
he was standing there,</i>

22:55.190 --> 22:56.359
<i>watching my beans burn.</i>

22:56.359 --> 22:58.693
What did you do?

22:58.693 --> 23:01.063
- He burned my beans!
- I didn't burn your beans!

23:01.063 --> 23:01.864
You burned my beans.

23:01.864 --> 23:03.432
Joey Funkhouser started
that fire

23:03.432 --> 23:04.466
with his big new penis.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.369
Mr. David, shut your mouth

23:06.369 --> 23:08.337
or I'll have my bailiff
do it for you.

23:08.337 --> 23:10.706
What's he gonna do?
Hit me?

23:10.706 --> 23:12.708
What are you gonna do?

23:12.708 --> 23:15.914
State would like to call
Matsue Takahashi.

23:18.549 --> 23:21.785
Mr. Takahashi,
could you please tell the jury

23:21.785 --> 23:23.385
what your occupation is?

23:23.385 --> 23:24.686
I own the golf club.

23:24.686 --> 23:26.288
How were Larry David's
interactions

23:26.288 --> 23:29.125
- with the other members?
- Oh, he's always disgruntled.

23:29.125 --> 23:32.694
And, also, he never say fore
when he hit the ball.

23:32.694 --> 23:34.663
<i>One time,
he hit a member in the back</i>

23:34.663 --> 23:36.765
<i>with a golf ball.</i>

23:36.765 --> 23:39.402
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, what the fuck?

23:39.402 --> 23:42.905
And I understand
there was an incident

23:42.905 --> 23:45.241
involving some wildlife
at the club?

23:45.241 --> 23:46.775
Oh, yes.

23:46.775 --> 23:48.210
<i>He killed...</i>

23:48.210 --> 23:51.346
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
<i>- ...my beautiful black swan,
Yoko.</i>

23:51.346 --> 23:53.249
Hey!

23:53.249 --> 23:55.417
The swan attacked me!

23:55.417 --> 23:56.918
It was kill or be killed.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.621
- You're a murderer. Murderer!
- It was self-defense.

23:58.621 --> 24:00.193
Order!

24:04.460 --> 24:06.295
The state is honored

24:06.295 --> 24:09.435
to call Lieutenant Colonel
Alexander Vindman.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.636
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,
I understand you have

24:14.636 --> 24:16.705
a long history
of uncovering corruption.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.273
I reported
President Donald Trump

24:18.273 --> 24:21.777
when he was sitting president
and he attempted to extort,

24:21.777 --> 24:23.845
in a quid pro quo,
President Zelenskyy,

24:23.845 --> 24:25.347
who's now fighting
a war against Russia,

24:25.347 --> 24:27.683
and President Trump
ended up being impeached.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.719
I continue to expose corruption
wherever I find it,

24:30.719 --> 24:32.621
and I will not tolerate
corruption

24:32.621 --> 24:35.257
from Trump, Putin,
or Larry David.

24:35.257 --> 24:36.658
Come on.

24:36.658 --> 24:39.896
Trump, Putin, and Larry David?

24:39.896 --> 24:41.998
That's an unusual combination.

24:41.998 --> 24:44.600
I overheard Larry David
attempting to bribe

24:44.600 --> 24:46.235
a Santa Monica
city councilwoman.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.402
It was a perfect call.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.471
A perfect call.

24:51.675 --> 24:52.941
<i>Vindman, Takahashi,</i>

24:52.941 --> 24:55.244
<i>they fly all the way out here
to do that?</i>

24:55.244 --> 24:56.679
They fly to Atlanta?

24:56.679 --> 24:58.213
I don't know.
What are we gonna do?

24:58.213 --> 25:00.349
What am I gonna do?
This is looking bad.

25:00.349 --> 25:02.485
Well, if I think of something,
I'll let you know.

25:02.485 --> 25:03.686
I gotta get going.

25:03.686 --> 25:05.254
Tomorrow's my anniversary

25:05.254 --> 25:08.591
and Susie made these
big dinner plans for us tonight,

25:08.591 --> 25:09.891
fancy restaurant.

25:09.891 --> 25:11.994
And you know what?
I gotta get her a gift.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.295
I don't even know
what the fuck to get her.

25:13.295 --> 25:15.031
Another one? You just got her
a birthday gift.

25:15.031 --> 25:17.131
I know. Yes.

25:17.131 --> 25:20.569
She loved that--
She loved that salad dressing.

25:20.569 --> 25:22.471
Couldn't get the recipe
from Auntie Rae.

25:22.471 --> 25:25.074
- That'd be a good gift.
- Yeah. That's a great gift.

25:25.074 --> 25:26.676
I know,
but she's not gonna give it out.

25:26.676 --> 25:27.776
She said no.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.245
I'm gonna give it
a little bit of a try.

25:29.245 --> 25:31.817
What are you talking about?
- Watch a man in action.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.385
Hey, there. It's Rae's.
How may I help you?

25:36.385 --> 25:38.453
My name is Journey Gunderson.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.590
My wife is in the hospital

25:41.590 --> 25:43.993
because of the dressing
on your salad.

25:43.993 --> 25:45.327
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

25:45.327 --> 25:46.929
There are numerous doctors

25:46.929 --> 25:49.231
<i>and we need to know
what's in that dressing.</i>

25:49.231 --> 25:52.001
Mr. Gunderson, we never give
that recipe out, sir.

25:52.001 --> 25:53.903
You need to let us know.

25:53.903 --> 25:55.871
Oh, that's her.
She's in so much pain.

25:55.871 --> 25:57.239
Ah!
Journey!

25:57.239 --> 25:59.942
The doctors need to know
the specific ingredients.

25:59.942 --> 26:01.710
<i>Journey!</i>
- I'm-- I'm-- I'm--

26:01.710 --> 26:04.546
I'm sorry. Mr. McGunderman,
is that your wife?

26:04.546 --> 26:05.982
<i>That was Karen Gunderson.</i>

26:05.982 --> 26:07.516
She's all catawampus.

26:07.516 --> 26:10.119
- I'm sorry. All kind of what?
- <i>Catawampus.</i>

26:10.119 --> 26:13.822
Wampus? What the heck is wampus,
Mr. Gurney Manunderson?

26:13.822 --> 26:16.186
<i>Hang in there.</i>

26:16.186 --> 26:17.126
Uh, Karen Gunderson,

26:17.126 --> 26:19.395
honey, me and your husband,
Gurney Germerny,

26:19.395 --> 26:20.724
we gon' get you better, baby.

26:20.724 --> 26:22.832
Now, listen here.
It's a tablespoon of vinegar.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.433
One tablespoon vinegar.

26:24.433 --> 26:27.003
And I use, yeah, three teaspoons

26:27.003 --> 26:28.938
<i>- of the olive oil.</i>
- Yeah.

26:28.938 --> 26:30.339
<i>And some clove garlic.</i>

26:30.339 --> 26:33.442
<i>And I use a half a teaspoon
of Dijon mustard, a dollop...</i>

26:33.442 --> 26:37.450
What is this?

26:39.347 --> 26:41.350
Auntie Rae's salad dressing.
Auntie Rae's salad dressing.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.487
Aw, that is so thoughtful.
How'd you get this?

26:44.487 --> 26:46.355
Love finds a way.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.391
Oh, baby doll.

26:48.391 --> 26:50.893
But, wait. There's more.

26:50.893 --> 26:52.294
- More? More?
- Oh, more.

26:52.294 --> 26:54.797
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Happy anniversary.

26:54.797 --> 26:56.766
- What is this?
- What? What-- What is this?

26:56.766 --> 26:58.233
It's a recipe.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.868
- Oh, the recipe!
- It's the recipe
for the salad dressing.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.603
- You got the recipe.
- Oh, my God.

27:01.603 --> 27:04.739
- How did you get
the fucking recipe?
- It's the recipe.

27:04.739 --> 27:07.343
This is the best gift
you've ever given.

27:07.343 --> 27:10.146
Better than any kind
of poem or sonnet.

27:10.146 --> 27:12.514
You're the best husband
in the whole world.

27:12.514 --> 27:14.349
What about this young man

27:14.349 --> 27:17.619
- from Chicago, huh?
- Mm-hmm. Oh, I love this.

27:17.619 --> 27:18.820
Look at this.

27:18.820 --> 27:21.023
- Oh. Hi, Leon.
- Oh, boy.
Look who's here.

27:21.023 --> 27:22.791
- You know what it is.
- Yeah, what?

27:22.791 --> 27:24.027
That motherfucking <i>Seinfeld,</i>
man.

27:24.027 --> 27:25.160
I've been catching up
on that shit.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.795
Binge watching
that bullshit, man.

27:26.795 --> 27:29.064
Oh, yeah? What do you--
What do you think?

27:29.064 --> 27:31.233
Man, this goddamn Kramer, man,
he's too much, man.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.635
Walk into your fucking house
unannounced and shit.

27:33.635 --> 27:35.732
- Yeah.
- You might as well take off
the fucking door

27:35.732 --> 27:37.106
and put a fucking saloon door
on that bitch.

27:37.106 --> 27:38.341
You know what I'm saying?

27:38.341 --> 27:40.075
This motherfucker
just walking in when he want to.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.278
So what's gonna happen today?

27:42.278 --> 27:43.579
Is it gonna be better
than yesterday?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.647
'Cause yesterday was a disaster.

27:45.647 --> 27:47.516
- I mean, a disaster.
- Yeah.

27:47.516 --> 27:49.719
I think this judge really
has it in for me.

27:49.719 --> 27:51.086
He really does.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.056
- What's it gonna be?
- I don't know.

27:53.056 --> 27:55.619
Anything you could do about it?
What? What?

27:55.619 --> 27:57.930
- I don't know.
- You know what you need?

27:59.163 --> 28:01.363
- Sympathy.
- Oh, really?

28:01.363 --> 28:04.266
Let me tell you a little story
about Horsecock Williams.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.869
This motherfucker's always
in trouble.

28:05.869 --> 28:07.573
Always in fucking court.

28:08.172 --> 28:09.838
Know what he fucking does?

28:09.838 --> 28:12.308
He'll come in the courtroom
in a wheelchair.

28:12.308 --> 28:15.510
And he rolls in there slow
and fucking shaking and shit.

28:15.510 --> 28:18.347
Everybody's like,
"Oh, my God. That poor man."

28:18.347 --> 28:21.750
The judge is touched.
The bailiff is touched.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.986
Sketch artist
is fucking bawling so bad

28:23.986 --> 28:25.887
that the sketch is blurry.

28:25.887 --> 28:29.593
And that motherfucker wins
every fucking time.

28:29.593 --> 28:31.460
This motherfucker wins.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.597
He is a sympathy snatcher.

28:33.597 --> 28:34.430
Wow.

28:34.430 --> 28:36.031
Horsecock is fucking amazing.

28:36.031 --> 28:39.100
He had an idea about
getting wheelchair hookers,

28:39.100 --> 28:40.735
put 'em out on the street
and shit. You know what I mean?

28:40.735 --> 28:43.439
Have you ever had sex
with a woman in a wheelchair?
'Cause I have.

28:43.439 --> 28:46.042
Have you ever tapped some ass
on crutches?

28:46.042 --> 28:48.277
You ever crutch fuck?

28:48.277 --> 28:50.279
That's like fucking an animal

28:50.279 --> 28:52.381
'cause the crutches
are an extra set of legs.

28:52.381 --> 28:55.417
Shit. Break that ass off, huh?

28:55.417 --> 28:57.220
Wheelchair hookers,

28:57.220 --> 28:59.723
there's a market
for every fucking thing.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.091
He always had great ideas
and shit.

29:03.091 --> 29:06.428
Motherfucker's innovative.
Horsecock is fucking amazing.

29:06.428 --> 29:09.498
Day two of the trial is underway
and it's up to the jury

29:09.498 --> 29:12.201
to decide
what kind of man Larry David is.

29:12.201 --> 29:15.504
We're expecting even more
witnesses from the prosecution.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.173
Free Larry. Free Larry.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.703
Jurors, I wanna remind you

29:19.703 --> 29:21.811
not to discuss
this case with anyone

29:21.811 --> 29:23.478
until deliberations begin.

29:23.478 --> 29:26.249
You'll have an opportunity
to deliberate--

29:26.249 --> 29:28.484
Get your fucking hands off me.

29:28.484 --> 29:32.986
I got it. I got it.
I'm fine. I'm not helpless.

29:34.656 --> 29:38.227
Oh, my God. Look at this.
She came, she came.

29:38.227 --> 29:41.296
- Oh, you're here.
- What is going on?

29:41.296 --> 29:43.099
- Honey. You came.
- Yeah.

29:43.099 --> 29:45.201
- I'm here.
- Look, look, look, look.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.369
Honey's here.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.139
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've carried you
up the steps.

29:50.139 --> 29:53.443
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Oh.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.178
Oh, oh, oh.

29:56.178 --> 29:59.616
Such a brave girl.
Oh, my God, what a surprise.

29:59.616 --> 30:00.850
Who is that?

30:00.850 --> 30:01.984
Just go with it.

30:01.984 --> 30:03.352
Are you through?
May we continue?

30:03.352 --> 30:05.921
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
My sweetheart just arrived.

30:05.921 --> 30:07.589
She got hit by a bus
a few months ago

30:07.589 --> 30:10.025
and she was lying on the ground,
I rushed over.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.128
I gave her
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

30:12.128 --> 30:15.430
And I carried her to my car.
Not that easy.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.800
Took her to the hospital,
we fell in love

30:17.800 --> 30:19.235
and I moved to Pacoima
to be with her.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.436
And look at her, the poor thing.

30:20.436 --> 30:22.304
I saved her life.
Tell-- Tell him I saved--

30:22.304 --> 30:24.473
You just told him.

30:24.473 --> 30:26.009
- Yeah, we're in love.
- Yeah.

30:26.009 --> 30:28.711
He's great.
He's a... He's a wonderful man.

30:28.711 --> 30:30.046
And the... the animals...

30:30.046 --> 30:31.480
- Oh, oh! Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.317
- He works in an animal shelter.
- The animal shelter. Yeah, yeah.

30:34.317 --> 30:36.551
- And the kids...
- And, uh-- Oh, the disable--

30:36.551 --> 30:38.254
- He works with disabled kids.
- Disabled kids.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.222
Oh, he walks in, "Larry's here!"

30:40.222 --> 30:42.258
They'd all jump up
if they could jump.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.293
All right, enough. Uh, please.

30:44.293 --> 30:46.729
Uh, prosecution, you got
any more witnesses to call?

30:46.729 --> 30:48.998
Yes. We would like to call, uh,

30:48.998 --> 30:51.167
witness Rachel Heineman, please.

30:54.203 --> 30:56.372
Could you please state
your name for the record?

30:56.372 --> 30:59.441
Rachel Raheli Shuli
Hamda Sarala Heineman.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.204
And how do you know
the defendant?

31:01.204 --> 31:05.014
I was unfortunate enough to be
on a ski lift with the accused.

31:05.014 --> 31:06.115
And for some reason,

31:06.115 --> 31:08.551
Hashem decided
to stop the ski lift

31:08.551 --> 31:10.152
as <i>shkiyat hachamah,</i>
that's sundown,

31:10.152 --> 31:11.653
was approaching,
and as a woman,

31:11.653 --> 31:13.556
I'm not allowed
to be with a man after sundown.

31:13.556 --> 31:15.792
<i>So I informed him...</i>

31:15.792 --> 31:17.053
Somebody's gonna have to jump.

31:17.053 --> 31:19.461
<i>- To which he said...</i>
- What, are you fucking nuts?

31:19.461 --> 31:20.897
<i>And so I was forced...</i>

31:21.730 --> 31:23.866
<i>...to jump 45 feet.</i>

31:23.866 --> 31:26.703
I broke both my knees,
my ankles.

31:26.703 --> 31:28.070
I put together a little diagram.

31:28.070 --> 31:29.972
I'm still traumatized.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.806
Yeah.

31:31.806 --> 31:36.713
Larry David pissed on a portrait
of Jesus Christ in my home.

31:36.713 --> 31:38.012
What?

31:38.012 --> 31:39.716
<i>He tinkled on it.</i>

31:39.716 --> 31:40.883
<i>- He sprayed Jesus.</i>
- Oh!

31:40.883 --> 31:43.352
<i>And not just a little.</i>

31:43.352 --> 31:46.120
He came to our restaurant.
He screamed.

31:59.102 --> 32:02.800
Larry David is a sad senior

32:02.800 --> 32:04.940
with long balls
and mental issues.

32:04.940 --> 32:08.211
<i>You've seen the big piles
of shoes in a Holocaust museum.</i>

32:08.211 --> 32:10.780
<i>What kind of monster
takes some of those shoes</i>

32:10.780 --> 32:12.647
<i>out of there and wears them?</i>

32:12.647 --> 32:14.416
Who can do that?

32:14.416 --> 32:16.051
<i>What kind of guy is Larry David?</i>

32:16.051 --> 32:18.421
<i>He's the kind of man
who carelessly,</i>

32:18.421 --> 32:21.957
<i>maybe even maliciously,
had me drink from his glass</i>

32:21.957 --> 32:23.225
<i>and gave me COVID.</i>

32:23.225 --> 32:25.060
He gave me COVID.

32:25.060 --> 32:27.196
- Bullshit.
<i>- Ruining the biggest night of my</i>

32:27.196 --> 32:28.898
<i>and some of my fans' lives.</i>

32:28.898 --> 32:30.166
<i>And he doesn't give a damn.</i>

32:30.166 --> 32:32.768
<i>And I still can't smell
a fucking thing.</i>

32:32.768 --> 32:35.137
State would like to call

32:35.137 --> 32:37.406
- Tara Michaelson.
- Who's that?

32:37.406 --> 32:39.074
- I don't know.
- Ms. Michaelson,

32:39.074 --> 32:42.377
how many years of therapy
have you had?

32:42.377 --> 32:44.947
I started therapy
when I was about nine.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.615
So, um, 21 years.

32:46.615 --> 32:49.485
And is there
one particular incident?

32:49.485 --> 32:51.620
When I was
about eight years old,

32:51.620 --> 32:53.555
I went with my parents
to a movie premiere.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.358
And right before
the movie started,

32:55.358 --> 32:58.995
I went by myself
to the women's restroom.

32:58.995 --> 33:01.364
<i>And I found
Larry standing there.</i>

33:01.364 --> 33:03.733
- Hello.
- Thank you
for fixing Judy's hair.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.067
Oh, you're welcome.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.872
<i>He gave me a hug.</i>

33:08.372 --> 33:10.639
Mommy! Mommy!
That bald man's in the bathroom

33:10.639 --> 33:13.142
and there's something hard
in his pants.

33:14.977 --> 33:16.379
Thank you, Ms. Michaelson.

33:16.379 --> 33:19.482
I believe the prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

33:19.482 --> 33:21.550
The defense will now call
their first witness, please.

33:21.550 --> 33:24.020
Yes, Your Honor,
I'd like to call Rae Black.

33:26.655 --> 33:27.923
That's my auntie right there.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.425
She carries candy in her bra.
If we're all lucky,

33:30.425 --> 33:31.993
we're gonna get
some of that titty-taffy.

33:31.993 --> 33:35.298
I'm so glad she's here.
So far, it's been a disaster.

33:35.298 --> 33:37.466
It was supposed to be so easy.

33:37.466 --> 33:39.705
Now, it's all gone catawampus.

33:47.746 --> 33:49.382
- What was that?
- Ah!

33:50.514 --> 33:51.850
What is happening?

33:56.418 --> 33:58.588
Mrs. Black,
Larry David gave you water

33:58.588 --> 33:59.622
on that hot day.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.523
But it's not the first time
he took care of you.

34:01.523 --> 34:04.126
He took you and your family
in after Hurricane Katrina.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.561
Well, his wife did.

34:06.561 --> 34:09.265
But you did live with him
for quite some time.

34:09.265 --> 34:10.299
It's true.

34:10.299 --> 34:14.503
Long enough for him
to use the N-word around me.

34:14.503 --> 34:16.906
He did that shit.

34:16.906 --> 34:18.307
- What?
- And long enough for him

34:18.307 --> 34:22.177
to hug me and have a hard-on,
an erection that he

34:22.177 --> 34:24.279
- was rubbing all up against me.
- We don't need
to talk about that.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.149
And the last time I saw him,

34:26.149 --> 34:28.583
he was carting around
a Black lawn jockey.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.051
- Move to strike, Your Honor.
- No, no, no.

34:30.051 --> 34:32.521
- That's her witness, Your Honor.
- Denied. It's your witness,

34:32.521 --> 34:33.789
you're stuck
with the answers she give.

34:33.789 --> 34:35.828
Why is she doing this
to you, Larr?

34:36.494 --> 34:37.626
And another thing.

34:37.626 --> 34:40.196
No, no, no.
No further questions.

34:40.196 --> 34:41.592
Thank you, Ms. Sanders.

34:41.592 --> 34:42.801
What the hell?

34:44.002 --> 34:47.236
You sons of bitches. It was you!

34:47.236 --> 34:50.205
I know it was you,
Bernie Bonderman,

34:50.205 --> 34:52.607
and you, Karen Bonderman,

34:52.607 --> 34:55.610
trying to steal my recipe.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.380
- How could you?
- You stole that recipe, Jeff?

34:58.380 --> 35:00.044
No.

35:00.044 --> 35:01.750
- You stole the recipe?
- No, I didn't--

35:01.750 --> 35:03.485
Fuck you, Larry David.

35:03.485 --> 35:05.754
- Ms. Black--
- And fuck
your monkey ass-friend...

35:05.754 --> 35:07.623
- Miss--
- ...Bashiba Munderman.

35:07.623 --> 35:09.859
Ms. Black, I will have order
in this court.

35:09.859 --> 35:12.228
You know what, fuck it!

35:12.228 --> 35:14.630
You lying piece of shit, Jeff.

35:14.630 --> 35:18.633
That is the lowest form
of anything I've ever heard.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.037
Stealing a fucking
anniversary gift.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.471
Take that recipe, Jeff,

35:22.471 --> 35:25.069
and shove it up
your fat fucking ass.

35:26.575 --> 35:29.779
Oh, my God. She's walking.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.880
She's walking!

35:31.880 --> 35:35.717
It's a miracle. It's a--
Look, it's just a miracle.

35:35.717 --> 35:39.088
How did she do it?
I can't even believe it.

35:39.088 --> 35:40.322
- Walking.
- Order.

35:40.322 --> 35:42.658
- She's walking. Oh. Oh.
- Mr. David.

35:42.658 --> 35:44.593
- Mr. David.
- Oh. She's walking.

35:44.593 --> 35:46.957
That's enough,
Mr. David.

35:49.098 --> 35:50.266
Pick this up tomorrow.

35:50.266 --> 35:52.433
This day is over.

35:52.433 --> 35:55.603
<i>Massive protests outside
the Atlanta courthouse today,</i>

35:55.603 --> 35:59.374
<i>- including multiple
Emmy-winning actor Ted Danson.
- Stop voter suppression!</i>

35:59.374 --> 36:00.942
<i>These are a little tight.</i>

36:00.942 --> 36:05.017
<i>There you go. Freedom to vote.</i>

36:06.584 --> 36:09.485
<i>-Maybe Ted Danson gives a damn
about democracy...
- Yeah.</i>

36:09.485 --> 36:11.586
<i>...that's why people love him.</i>

36:11.586 --> 36:14.523
<i>That's why people respect him.
Mika...</i>

36:14.523 --> 36:15.957
<i>-I know.
- That's why the guy's my hero.</i>

36:15.957 --> 36:18.694
<i>-Yeah. He's an amazing actor.
- Oh, I love you, guys.</i>

36:18.694 --> 36:20.995
<i>No, no, don't,
don't touch the hair.</i>

36:20.995 --> 36:25.534
<i>What if Ted Danson had given
that woman in the line water,</i>

36:25.534 --> 36:27.002
<i>instead of Larry David?</i>

36:27.002 --> 36:28.904
<i>I think everything
would be different, right?</i>

36:28.904 --> 36:30.467
Larr!
<i>Yeah.
Likability, certainly...</i>

36:30.467 --> 36:33.176
- Hey, you made it. Oh!
- Look at you. Oh, my God.

36:33.176 --> 36:35.511
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

36:35.511 --> 36:37.979
It's a bottle of water.
I mean, it's not your fault.

36:37.979 --> 36:40.717
- Exactly. I didn't do anything.
- Pure, decent human being

36:40.717 --> 36:41.983
is all you're trying to be.

36:41.983 --> 36:43.652
- Let that be a lesson to me.
- Right.

36:43.652 --> 36:45.554
So, how are you getting
through this?

36:45.554 --> 36:47.423
You're sitting in court all day?

36:47.423 --> 36:49.325
- Yeah.
- Well, what do you think about?

36:49.325 --> 36:51.793
- Let me give you a hypothetical.
- Okay.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.463
Suppose you're friends
with someone

36:54.463 --> 36:55.797
- who's in the circus.
- Sure.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.732
- He knows
the bearded lady very well.
- Okay.

36:57.732 --> 36:59.702
And you go to the performance
at the Garden, he says,

36:59.702 --> 37:02.971
"Hey, the bearded lady's having
a little shindig,

37:02.971 --> 37:04.706
- why don't you join us?"
- A little get-together.

37:04.706 --> 37:06.742
You go to
the bearded lady's apartment.

37:06.742 --> 37:08.944
- It's a normal apartment.
- Nothing freakish.

37:08.944 --> 37:10.374
- No, nothing freakish at all.
- Yeah.

37:10.374 --> 37:11.915
You wouldn't know you were
in a freak's apartment.

37:11.915 --> 37:12.943
- No.
- Okay.

37:12.943 --> 37:15.150
Now, you see this picture.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.153
- This gorgeous woman.
- Yeah.

37:17.153 --> 37:20.589
And your friend says to you,
"That's the bearded lady."

37:20.589 --> 37:22.991
- She has no beard.
- Clean-shaven bearded lady.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.695
She's quitting the circus.
She's got a big crush on you.

37:26.695 --> 37:28.864
- Really?
- She'd love to go out with you.

37:28.864 --> 37:30.432
- She's gonna start shaving.
- Really?

37:30.432 --> 37:32.734
- But at the party
when we're there...
- At the party.

37:32.734 --> 37:34.570
- ...she's got the beard on.
- She's got the beard on.

37:34.570 --> 37:36.239
- Rabbinical?
- Very rabbinical.

37:36.239 --> 37:37.940
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Wow.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.809
Yeah. Any interest?

37:39.809 --> 37:41.576
- She's sexy.
- Everything.

37:41.576 --> 37:43.146
- Charming.
- Got it all.

37:43.146 --> 37:44.380
- Wow.
- The kind of woman

37:44.380 --> 37:45.714
- you used to dream about...
- Yeah.

37:45.714 --> 37:47.816
- ...when you were a teenager.
- Yeah.

37:47.816 --> 37:50.619
- Fly in the ointment, though.
- Yeah.

37:50.619 --> 37:53.489
And this is a big fly,
and he's alive.

37:53.489 --> 37:54.823
What's the worst
that could happen?

37:54.823 --> 37:57.360
The worst that could happen
is it's a paper napkin...

37:57.360 --> 37:58.860
...and she wipes her mouth,

37:58.860 --> 38:01.597
and, uh, there's some--
part of it snags.

38:01.597 --> 38:03.699
Is there
a Fred Flintstone kind of line?

38:03.699 --> 38:05.001
- No, there's no line.
- No line?

38:05.001 --> 38:06.935
No, there's no line.
She gets a good shave.

38:06.935 --> 38:09.037
- Electric or blade?
- Blade. She shaves every day.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.573
But at the end of the day,
she's five o'clock shadow lady.

38:11.573 --> 38:13.203
She'll shave twice a day
for you.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.210
What if I happen
to be home at 4:30?

38:15.210 --> 38:16.445
Guess who's on the ledge.

38:20.749 --> 38:22.885
Today, Larry David
will take the stand,

38:22.885 --> 38:24.821
and he will get a chance
to explain

38:24.821 --> 38:26.588
his motivations on election day.

38:26.588 --> 38:28.823
And defend himself
from the accusations

38:28.823 --> 38:31.127
hurled at him
by yesterday's witnesses.

38:31.127 --> 38:36.798
Larry David...

38:36.798 --> 38:38.800
Mr. David has got
his work cut out for him,

38:38.800 --> 38:41.703
<i>the picture that's been painted
by the prosecution so far</i>

38:41.703 --> 38:44.839
<i>is that of a petty, conniving,
and, frankly,</i>

38:44.839 --> 38:46.709
<i>spiteful man.</i>

38:46.709 --> 38:49.073
And how hot was it
that day?

38:49.073 --> 38:50.246
- It was a scorcher.
- Mm.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.748
Even I was sweating,
and let me tell you something,

38:52.748 --> 38:54.517
I don't sweat,
it's the craziest thing.

38:54.517 --> 38:56.847
Like I could be playing
basketball in the summer,

38:56.847 --> 38:57.786
I won't sweat.

38:57.786 --> 39:00.589
You know,
occasionally for some reason,

39:00.589 --> 39:02.757
I'll sweat during intercourse
sometimes, which is odd.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.828
- You know, all of a sudden,
"Oh, I'm sweating!" You know?
- He needs to stop talking.

39:05.828 --> 39:09.431
And how long
was the line to vote?

39:09.431 --> 39:10.899
It was really long.

39:10.899 --> 39:15.704
All those people
having to wait in the hot sun.

39:15.704 --> 39:18.408
No trees.

39:18.408 --> 39:19.609
No grass.

39:19.609 --> 39:21.577
And was there any shade?

39:21.577 --> 39:23.949
No shade.

39:28.086 --> 39:32.821
I know I speak
for Ms. Black and all of us

39:32.821 --> 39:35.191
when I say thank you
for your actions.

39:35.191 --> 39:37.860
Oh, God bless you.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.665
And may God bless us all.

39:46.570 --> 39:48.102
- Yes. Yes.
- Thank you, Ms. Sanders.

39:48.102 --> 39:51.308
- Prosecution, you got a cross?
- Yes, Your Honor.

39:51.308 --> 39:52.341
Proceed.

39:52.341 --> 39:54.009
Let's talk about laws,
Mr. David.

39:54.009 --> 39:55.645
Do you ever remember
taking anything

39:55.645 --> 39:56.946
that didn't belong to you?

39:56.946 --> 39:58.681
You ever remember
stealing anything?

39:58.681 --> 40:00.549
- No. No.
- No?

40:00.549 --> 40:02.752
- You don't remember
taking flowers...
- No.

40:02.752 --> 40:04.320
- ...from a dead woman's...
- No.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.724
...memorial?

40:08.625 --> 40:12.060
<i>Oh, that? Well...</i>

40:12.060 --> 40:16.269
Do you remember taking
a golf club out of a coffin?

40:18.135 --> 40:19.768
<i>It was my 5-wood.</i>

40:19.768 --> 40:22.004
<i>You pried the club
out of a dead man's hand?</i>

40:22.004 --> 40:24.634
<i>Okay. So you know
when you get attached to a club,</i>

40:24.634 --> 40:27.476
<i>you don't wanna give it up
even if it's in a coffin?</i>

40:27.476 --> 40:29.412
Well, that was that 5-wood
for me.

40:29.412 --> 40:31.717
Did you ever bribe
a city councilman?

40:32.650 --> 40:35.251
<i>Do you remember breaking in
to the house</i>

40:35.251 --> 40:36.752
<i>of the head of the city council</i>

40:36.752 --> 40:39.955
<i>in order to take a letter
from Mr. Vindman</i>

40:39.955 --> 40:42.024
<i>that incriminated you?</i>

40:42.024 --> 40:44.593
Ladies and gentlemen,
Larry David undermines

40:44.593 --> 40:46.195
our free and fair elections.

40:46.195 --> 40:49.365
He is exactly
who the Election Integrity Act

40:49.365 --> 40:51.066
was built to protect us from.

40:51.066 --> 40:53.998
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

40:53.998 --> 40:55.404
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:55.404 --> 40:57.807
Let's go back
to the year 2000,

40:57.807 --> 40:58.841
if we could, please.

40:58.841 --> 41:01.744
Larry David, this is
from the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

41:01.744 --> 41:03.878
It's an obituary written by you.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.749
Could you read it
to the jury please, sir?

41:06.749 --> 41:09.351
"Devoted sister, beloved cunt."

41:09.351 --> 41:10.453
Huh?

41:10.453 --> 41:12.758
It's a typo. Don't you see?

41:13.492 --> 41:14.690
It's a typo.

41:14.690 --> 41:15.991
The fact is...

41:15.991 --> 41:18.093
...I've heard that she actually
was a bit of a cunt.

41:18.093 --> 41:20.296
But that's still no excuse

41:20.296 --> 41:21.831
to put that in a newspaper.

41:21.831 --> 41:24.400
I have no further questions.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.235
Thank you, Counselor.

41:26.235 --> 41:28.604
- I've talked to Larry
about <i>Seinfeld</i> and shit.
- Mm-hmm.

41:28.604 --> 41:30.339
So...

41:30.339 --> 41:32.676
my question is,
where the fuck are the tapes at?

41:32.676 --> 41:33.808
- Tapes?
- Larr-- The tapes.

41:33.808 --> 41:35.477
Larry won't give that shit up.
The tapes.

41:35.477 --> 41:36.778
- What tapes?
- The fuck tapes.

41:36.778 --> 41:37.947
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

41:37.947 --> 41:39.615
- No, I don't.
- Every week,

41:39.615 --> 41:40.850
you getting new ass, right?

41:40.850 --> 41:42.117
Every fucking show...

41:42.117 --> 41:43.886
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you meet some new chick.

41:43.886 --> 41:45.889
- Well.
- And I know you fucking.

41:45.889 --> 41:47.456
- You probably fucking people.
- Mm-hmm.

41:47.456 --> 41:49.892
I did. I did. I had 'em all.

41:49.892 --> 41:50.960
- Of course, man.
- Yeah.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.728
- Come on.
- And it's all on tape.

41:52.728 --> 41:53.795
I don't know how you knew.

41:53.795 --> 41:54.863
I figured that shit out,
that's why.

41:54.863 --> 41:57.366
Yeah. Yeah.
But they're on laser disc.

41:57.366 --> 41:58.868
- Oh!
- Do you have a player?

41:58.868 --> 42:00.569
- Fuck me, man.
- Yeah, sorry.

42:00.569 --> 42:02.771
- No way to convert that shit
to something else?
- Yeah. No.

42:02.771 --> 42:06.108
That's a shame.
It's 13 unbelievable hours.

42:06.108 --> 42:08.011
- What a fucking waste, man.
- Yeah.

42:08.011 --> 42:09.482
I might sell it to Netflix.

42:10.315 --> 42:11.847
<i>But it doesn't change the fact</i>

42:11.847 --> 42:14.649
that this law
is unconstitutional.

42:14.649 --> 42:18.824
Yes, Larry David
did a lot of things wrong.

42:20.158 --> 42:23.860
But this time,
he did something right.

42:23.860 --> 42:25.961
And now,

42:25.961 --> 42:29.535
you have the opportunity
to do something right too.

42:31.570 --> 42:32.766
Thank you.

42:33.972 --> 42:35.538
- Look at her.
- Terrific.

42:35.538 --> 42:37.140
Thank you, Counselor.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.273
Mr. Mack.

42:38.273 --> 42:40.279
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Wow. That was great.

42:41.378 --> 42:44.550
I know some of you
may not like this law.

42:45.783 --> 42:47.049
But he broke it.

42:47.049 --> 42:49.218
And this is
an incredible opportunity

42:49.218 --> 42:53.856
to put away somebody before
they hurt other good people.

42:53.856 --> 42:57.827
We are just scratching
the surface of the depths

42:57.827 --> 43:00.262
that this monster will go to.

43:00.262 --> 43:02.131
There's a police report
that exists

43:02.131 --> 43:04.800
stating that Larry David
would not give candy

43:04.800 --> 43:06.569
<i>- to children on Halloween.</i>
- Trick or treat.

43:06.569 --> 43:07.869
I don't-- I don't think so.

43:07.869 --> 43:10.239
- God, asshole! Fuck you.
- Thanks for nothing, asshole.

43:10.239 --> 43:14.513
He broke into a graveyard
to move his mother's body.

43:15.413 --> 43:16.579
- This is nice.
- Oh, yeah?

43:16.579 --> 43:19.648
<i>He brought a sex offender
to a Passover seder.</i>

43:19.648 --> 43:22.886
<i>He ate a dying dog's last meal.</i>

43:22.886 --> 43:25.288
Oh, that is really good.

43:25.288 --> 43:26.889
<i>And he fornicated...</i>

43:26.889 --> 43:29.559
<i>...with a blowup doll
in broad daylight.</i>

43:29.559 --> 43:31.330
Oh, my God.

43:31.929 --> 43:33.495
I made you a pillow sham.

43:33.495 --> 43:36.032
- <i>He taught a child
how to make a swastika.</i>
- What the...

43:36.032 --> 43:37.700
What was his name again,
Larry?

43:37.700 --> 43:38.667
Hitler?

43:38.667 --> 43:40.869
- Get in the car.
- <i>He hired a prostitute</i>

43:40.869 --> 43:44.007
<i>so that he could drive
in the carpool lane.</i>

43:44.007 --> 43:46.275
I had sex with my uncle.

43:46.275 --> 43:51.384
And he pretended
to be an incest survivor...

43:52.450 --> 43:54.349
named Todd.

43:54.349 --> 43:58.721
This man was asked to go
to a dinner and just be cordial

43:58.721 --> 44:00.089
and he couldn't even do that, folks.

44:00.089 --> 44:02.191
He couldn't even be cordial.

44:02.191 --> 44:06.095
Good people,
you have one decision to make.

44:06.095 --> 44:08.097
I trust you'll make
the right one.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.968
Thank you, Mr. Mack.

44:12.968 --> 44:15.004
Jury will now begin
their deliberations.

44:15.004 --> 44:17.773
All rise.

44:17.773 --> 44:19.278
Court is adjourned.

44:19.944 --> 44:21.247
How you feeling?

44:22.814 --> 44:24.016
Confident.

44:31.420 --> 44:32.921
Jerry. Jerry Seinfeld.

44:32.921 --> 44:34.823
- Oh, my word. Sorry, man.
- Hey, how you doing?

44:34.823 --> 44:36.291
Can I have two seconds
of your time, please?

44:36.291 --> 44:39.061
I can't. I'm having dinner
with my friends.

44:39.061 --> 44:40.229
My name's Michael Fouchay.

44:40.229 --> 44:41.964
I'm actually
a legitimate businessman.

44:41.964 --> 44:43.933
- I run Fouchay Enterprises.
- All right.

44:43.933 --> 44:45.468
You might have heard of us.

44:45.468 --> 44:47.469
- We own several businesses.
- I have not,
but I like the accent.

44:47.469 --> 44:48.637
- South African?
- Yes.

44:48.637 --> 44:50.405
- Yeah, I like that accent.
- I'm amazed you recognize it.

44:50.405 --> 44:51.768
- Yeah, I do.
- Thank you.

44:51.768 --> 44:54.176
I mean, I think accents
in general are moronic.

44:54.176 --> 44:55.945
- Right.
- Why don't you talk the way
we talk?

44:55.945 --> 44:57.046
You're here. You can hear it.

44:57.046 --> 44:59.215
Listen, my brother's
having a birthday.

44:59.215 --> 45:01.250
He's turning 40.
I've got a lovely house.

45:01.250 --> 45:03.752
No one ever turned 40 before.
Yeah, go ahead.

45:03.752 --> 45:06.055
You come, you smile,
take a few photos,

45:06.055 --> 45:07.990
shake a few hands,
just be cordial.

45:07.990 --> 45:09.425
Yeah. Can't do it.

45:09.425 --> 45:11.364
- Why not?
- Can't be cordial.

45:12.096 --> 45:15.163
Um... Uh...

45:15.163 --> 45:17.098
- Uh, excuse me. No, I'm sorry.
- Oh. Excuse me. Pardon me.

45:17.098 --> 45:18.600
- No, go ahead. No, I'm so sorry.
- So sorry. No, you go.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.669
- No, go ahead.
- Hey, you know,
you look a lot like Joe Pesci.

45:20.669 --> 45:22.038
- Anybody ever tell you that?
- Really?

45:22.038 --> 45:23.506
- Yeah.
- You think I'm fucking funny?

45:23.506 --> 45:25.008
- You think I'm a clown?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:25.008 --> 45:26.209
Am I here
to make you fucking laugh?

45:26.209 --> 45:28.981
Yeah, that's what he says
in the...

45:39.324 --> 45:40.489
<i>The jury has reached a verdict</i>

45:40.489 --> 45:42.992
in the trial of the people
of the state of Georgia

45:42.992 --> 45:44.393
versus Larry David.

45:44.393 --> 45:46.895
It's not about what this man
has done or the poor decisions

45:46.895 --> 45:50.232
he's made in the past,
it is about this heinous

45:50.232 --> 45:52.401
<i>and needlessly cruel law.</i>

46:01.778 --> 46:03.079
Huh?

46:03.079 --> 46:04.980
- You're here?
- Hey, LD.

46:04.980 --> 46:06.849
Don't worry.
I broke up with Cynthia.

46:06.849 --> 46:09.151
Oh, jeez. Really?
That's too bad.

46:09.151 --> 46:10.486
Yeah, well,
I'm a little worried.

46:10.486 --> 46:12.655
- She bought a gun.
- She's gonna kill herself?

46:12.655 --> 46:14.523
No. You.

46:14.523 --> 46:16.529
That's funny.

46:17.061 --> 46:18.464
It's not a joke.

46:19.665 --> 46:20.462
Hey, man.

46:20.462 --> 46:22.799
I binged
all those <i>Seinfeld</i> episodes.

46:22.799 --> 46:23.900
Oh, yeah?

46:23.900 --> 46:25.902
All I got left
is the fucking finale.

46:25.902 --> 46:26.930
Wow.

46:26.930 --> 46:28.804
Although, I heard
some terrible things about it.

46:28.804 --> 46:30.939
I heard you fucked it up.

46:30.939 --> 46:33.646
- All rise.
- Good luck today, man.

46:41.085 --> 46:42.418
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

46:42.418 --> 46:45.187
- have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.

46:51.395 --> 46:52.795
I don't understand,
why does the judge

46:52.795 --> 46:54.162
have to peek at it?

46:54.162 --> 46:57.132
Yeah, and I gotta see it,
and then ma-- then you go back.

46:57.132 --> 46:58.200
This makes no sense.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.339
Yeah.
They can't make two copies?

47:06.544 --> 47:10.312
On the charge of violating
the Election Integrity Act,

47:10.312 --> 47:12.251
how do you find the defendant?

47:15.419 --> 47:17.920
We find the defendant guilty.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.088
- What?
- Oh, come on.

47:19.088 --> 47:20.957
- This is a travesty of justice.
- Come on.

47:20.957 --> 47:24.193
Oh, my God.

47:24.193 --> 47:26.923
Mr. David,
seems you have a history

47:26.923 --> 47:30.666
of doing the same things wrong
over and over.

47:30.666 --> 47:34.570
And I truly hope this time
you finally learned your lesson.

47:34.570 --> 47:36.172
And to make sure of that,
I'm gonna sentence you

47:36.172 --> 47:38.007
to the maximum the law allows.

47:38.007 --> 47:39.208
One year in prison.

47:39.208 --> 47:43.245
- What? Come on. Seriously?
- Larry, look.

47:43.245 --> 47:45.347
When you get there,
get a job at the library.

47:45.347 --> 47:46.983
No, I think the infirmary.

47:46.983 --> 47:48.150
Maybe something
in reception.

47:48.150 --> 47:50.052
"Hello, jail. Can I help you?"

47:50.052 --> 47:51.320
Bailiff.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.089
Take Mr. David into custody.

47:53.089 --> 47:54.456
Hey, Larry. Don't worry.

47:54.456 --> 47:57.360
I'm gonna take real, real
good care of that house of ours.

47:57.360 --> 47:59.896
- Oh, my God.
- Bye, Larr.

47:59.896 --> 48:01.064
Hey,
let me ask you something.

48:01.064 --> 48:03.332
What do you do about,
you know, toothpaste

48:03.332 --> 48:06.068
and shaving cream and Q-tips?

48:06.068 --> 48:08.871
Is-- Is there a store
or is it like a hotel

48:08.871 --> 48:10.139
where they just leave it out
for you?

48:10.139 --> 48:11.974
And can I bring
my own toilet paper?

48:11.974 --> 48:13.342
Oh, and my phone charger.

48:13.342 --> 48:15.077
Leon, Leon,
I need my phone charger.

48:15.077 --> 48:16.712
- You don't got a charger.
- I loaned it to you.

48:16.712 --> 48:19.683
- I gave it back.
- Bullshit! That's my charger!

48:21.150 --> 48:23.352
I should probably go do
some interviews.

48:23.352 --> 48:25.358
Where should we eat?

48:31.195 --> 48:32.929
Hey. Look at this.

48:32.929 --> 48:34.597
That happens to me too.

48:34.597 --> 48:37.099
- What do you call that?
- It's a pants tent.

48:37.099 --> 48:38.467
- Pants tent.
- Yeah.

48:38.467 --> 48:40.804
I got a five-inch bunch up here.

48:40.804 --> 48:42.005
You know something,

48:42.005 --> 48:44.206
I stopped wearing corduroys
because of that.

48:44.206 --> 48:46.108
Yeah, I'm wearing corduroys now.

48:46.108 --> 48:48.144
Yeah, and women,

48:48.144 --> 48:49.445
they don't know
what a pants tent is.

48:49.445 --> 48:51.748
They-- It could lead
to misunderstandings.

48:51.748 --> 48:53.182
They get confused.

48:53.182 --> 48:55.151
Hey.

48:55.151 --> 48:56.855
Somebody's here to see you.

48:59.856 --> 49:02.258
All right, Chuckles.
Let's get you out of here.

49:02.258 --> 49:03.658
- What? Wait.
- Yeah.

49:03.658 --> 49:05.562
What are you-- What are you--
What are you talking about?

49:05.562 --> 49:06.963
It's over.

49:06.963 --> 49:09.065
- It's over?
- You're a free man.

49:09.065 --> 49:10.466
- I'm a free man?
- That's right.

49:10.466 --> 49:12.701
- How am I a free man?
- I'll tell you how.

49:12.701 --> 49:14.937
You know that Mexican restaurant
near the hotel?

49:14.937 --> 49:16.205
I go there
to get something to eat.

49:16.205 --> 49:17.572
I don't even like Mexican food.

49:17.572 --> 49:19.275
That's okay.
I won't tell anybody.

49:19.275 --> 49:21.410
- What do I care?
- Well, some people care.

49:21.410 --> 49:22.911
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:22.911 --> 49:26.048
Anyway, there's this guy there,
looks like Joe Pesci.

49:26.048 --> 49:27.884
So I go up to him,
talking to him.

49:27.884 --> 49:29.285
I go you really look like Pesci

49:29.285 --> 49:30.685
- from <i>Goodfellas.</i>
- Yeah.

49:30.685 --> 49:32.388
He goes, "Oh, what am I,
a clown for you?"

49:32.388 --> 49:33.589
I go, "Ah, that's a Pesci line."

49:33.589 --> 49:34.756
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know?

49:34.756 --> 49:36.691
- He doesn't like that too much.
- Uh-huh.

49:36.691 --> 49:40.295
Anyway, today in the courtroom,
I look in the jury box.

49:40.295 --> 49:42.865
<i>That's that guy. Same guy.</i>

49:42.865 --> 49:44.099
The hair, Pesci.

49:44.099 --> 49:45.234
Yeah, yeah,
that's the guy in the jury.

49:45.234 --> 49:46.802
- The juror. I know that guy.
- Yeah.

49:46.802 --> 49:48.570
- The big pompadour. Yeah, yeah.
- With the hair.
Yeah, yeah.

49:48.570 --> 49:50.339
He's not supposed to be
in a Mexican restaurant

49:50.339 --> 49:51.707
because he's under sequester.

49:51.707 --> 49:53.609
- He broke his sequester?
- Broke his sequester.

49:53.609 --> 49:55.677
- He's supposed to sequester.
- He's supposed to sequester.

49:55.677 --> 49:57.646
- He's a bad sequesterer.
- You can't not sequester

49:57.646 --> 49:59.648
- when you're supposed
to sequester, right?
- You should be sequestering.

49:59.648 --> 50:02.351
Yeah. I tell the judge,
judge calls the restaurant,

50:02.351 --> 50:04.320
they look
at the security footage.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.560
Mistrial declared.
Sentence thrown out.

50:08.226 --> 50:09.358
You're done.

50:09.358 --> 50:12.861
How about that, sport fans?

50:12.861 --> 50:17.133
Uh-- I-- Well, you know...
Come on.

50:17.133 --> 50:18.896
- Ah!
- I mean, crazy.

50:18.896 --> 50:20.369
You don't wanna end up
like this.

50:20.369 --> 50:21.807
Nobody wants to see it.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.442
Trust me.

50:24.375 --> 50:25.574
Wow.

50:25.574 --> 50:27.243
Breathe the free air, young man.

50:27.243 --> 50:29.478
Yes.

50:32.014 --> 50:33.319
Oh, my God.

50:35.420 --> 50:37.887
This is how
we should've ended the finale.

50:37.887 --> 50:39.588
Oh, my God, you're right.

50:39.588 --> 50:41.519
How did we not think of that?

50:46.797 --> 50:48.765
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our cruising...</i>

50:48.765 --> 50:49.565
Wow.

50:49.565 --> 50:50.800
- Yeah.
- Try that one.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.168
- You know what?
- Yeah.

50:52.168 --> 50:53.369
Handcuffs look tight
on that one.

50:53.369 --> 50:54.870
They do. Did they hurt?

50:54.870 --> 50:56.272
- Uh-uh.
- No?

50:56.272 --> 50:57.841
Montgomery Clift.

51:02.346 --> 51:04.045
- Whoo! Hey.
- Hey, what is that?

51:04.045 --> 51:06.348
- I need it for the light.
I need it to read.
- The what? I'm--

51:06.348 --> 51:08.317
I'm trying to read.
I can't see. You're blinding me.

51:08.317 --> 51:09.518
Well, I need it to read.
I need--

51:09.518 --> 51:11.553
Why don't you use
the overhead light?

51:11.553 --> 51:12.988
Just let her keep the shade up.

51:12.988 --> 51:15.324
I'm trying to watch a movie,
all I see is glare.

51:15.324 --> 51:17.126
It's like I'm watching
a fucking radio right now.

51:17.126 --> 51:18.594
My retinas are burning.

51:18.594 --> 51:20.329
This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

51:20.329 --> 51:21.763
Cheryl and I want it open.

51:21.763 --> 51:24.367
It's a community shade.
She doesn't own that shade.

51:24.367 --> 51:26.435
- Go fuck yourself, Larr.
- We'll take a vote.

51:26.435 --> 51:28.603
Go back to fucking jail, Larry.

51:28.603 --> 51:30.839
- Oh, nice. That's nice.
- I vote with them.

51:30.839 --> 51:33.008
- I vote with them.
- It's not your window.
