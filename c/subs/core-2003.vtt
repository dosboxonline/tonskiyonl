[distorted sounds]

[ticking stops]

01:11.614 --> 01:13.282
[scoffs]

01:13.449 --> 01:15.993
- It stopped.
- What's that, Dave?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.037
Nothing. How we doing?

01:18.204 --> 01:19.330
Oh, we're ready.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.708
- You, uh, feeling the magic?
- Oh, I'm feeling the magic, all right.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.502
- Let's hit 'em.
- Yeah.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.879
- Let's do it.
- Here we go.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.591
- Let's hit 'em.
- Let's go make $30 million.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.098
[Dave] Good morning.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.684
Before I begin, let me...

01:47.066 --> 01:48.943
[all murmuring]

01:49.110 --> 01:51.195
- David?
- I'll go get help.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.781
- [horns honking, brakes screeching]
- Jesus. Jesus, David.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.491
- [cars crashing]
- Phone 911. Phone 911!

01:55.658 --> 01:57.076
[woman] David?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.621
[crashing continues]

02:00.788 --> 02:02.998
[people screaming]

02:05.751 --> 02:07.920
[man] Nick? Nicky?!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.505
N icky!

02:09.672 --> 02:11.799
[screams continue]

02:24.603 --> 02:26.355
[sirens approaching]

02:33.154 --> 02:34.864
[man 1] OK.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.533
[man 2] It's OK, it's OK.
You'll be OK.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.326
Get everybody else off the bus.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.454
[ticking continues]

02:45.541 --> 02:48.252
[man 3] Sound waves.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.130
So...

02:51.297 --> 02:55.259
...if we know that sound waves
gain wavelength...

02:55.426 --> 02:56.552
[writing on chalkboard]

02:56.719 --> 02:59.263
...and lose frequency

02:59.430 --> 03:02.266
as they travel
through more dense materials...

03:04.143 --> 03:06.562
...then the anomalies in these waves...

03:08.355 --> 03:11.025
...are the means
by which we can surmise

03:11.192 --> 03:12.610
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

03:16.155 --> 03:19.074
- How are the nails coming, Christine?
- [laughter]

03:20.117 --> 03:24.038
Good. All right,
let's have a demonstration.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.541
Mr. Acker, Veronica.
Thank you very much.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.211
[blows loud note]

03:30.377 --> 03:34.632
All right. Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

03:34.798 --> 03:37.801
loves walks in the park, bedtime
stories, big romantic. Loves Chet.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.012
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.848
Watch the oscilloscope, all right?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.600
Here we go.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.394
[playing off-key]

03:49.146 --> 03:50.356
[clears throat]

03:52.775 --> 03:55.611
- Dr. Joshua Keyes?
- Maybe.

03:55.778 --> 03:59.281
- Yes or no, sir?
- The first one.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.033
Please come with us, sir.

04:04.662 --> 04:08.249
- [stammers] Guys, what's going on?
- We don't know, sir.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.334
What do you mean, you don't know?

04:10.501 --> 04:13.170
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.922
I have security clearance?

04:15.089 --> 04:18.132
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.343
I have a jet?

04:31.355 --> 04:33.440
[man speaking French]

04:36.402 --> 04:38.153
Hey, Serge.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.197
Serge. Serge.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.368
Damn! It's about time.
You're always late.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.204
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.708
What am I doing here? They wouldn't
brief me until you got here.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.712
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military. I hate them.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.548
When are you going to meet a nice girl
and bring her for dinner?

04:57.715 --> 05:00.175
- I'm married to my work.
- So am I.

05:00.342 --> 05:04.430
Which makes my wife my mistress.
That's why I'm still in love with her.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.142
- You were always a romantic.
- I love my wife.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.145
- Yeah, I know. I love your wife, too.
- I know.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.230
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.398
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.358
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.235
- Ah, the cheese.
- [both laugh]

05:18.402 --> 05:22.156
- You're... you're teasing me, right?
- Oh, my...!

05:22.323 --> 05:23.991
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.784
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.412
- Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
- [man] No.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.165
If you were in the wrong place,
you would've already been shot.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.918
- That's a hell of a greeting.
- Serge.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.504
- Serge.
- Serge. Yes. Always a pleasure.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.673
Same here, Thomas.
Dr. Keyes.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.343
I know. Tom Purcell.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.012
Gentlemen, you do realise
that everything here

05:45.179 --> 05:47.389
is totally classified, OK?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.644
At 10.30 a.m. local time,

05:52.811 --> 05:55.773
32 civilians,
all within a ten-block radius...

05:56.648 --> 05:57.858
...died.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.693
They didn't get sick first.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.447
- They simply hit the ground dead.
- Nerve agent?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.699
- [Tom] Our first guess. No.
- They all died at the same time?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.077
[Tom] As far as we can tell,
to the second.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.621
This hits CNN in one hour.
I need a reason.

06:10.788 --> 06:13.332
[Serge] Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

06:13.499 --> 06:15.167
They all had pacemakers.

06:15.918 --> 06:19.380
Under a minute.
Your reputation is well-deserved.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.258
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Tom] How did you guess,

06:23.425 --> 06:25.719
- without any clues from the victims?
- No, that's...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.262
Serge and I are the clues.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.557
I mean, he specialises in high energy
weapons. I do geomagnetics.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.269
So calling us means you suspect
an electromagnetic pulse weapon.

06:34.436 --> 06:38.148
If these are the only fatalities,
they must be people susceptible to...

06:38.315 --> 06:41.026
- ...electronic interference.
- QED pacemakers.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.779
- You're spooky sometimes?
- [Tom] Now, I need to know,

06:44.363 --> 06:46.156
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

06:46.323 --> 06:49.034
The power that you would need
to create an EM pulse strong enough...

06:49.201 --> 06:51.120
I mean, that's... that's not a weapon
that I've ever heard of.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.123
- No.
- OK, we're done.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.669
We're not done, sir. There's nothing
on the other side of the equal sign.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.712
- I agree with Joshua...
- Thank you.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.965
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

07:03.132 --> 07:06.844
but since it's not, I think we can all
breathe a little easier, can't we?

07:08.178 --> 07:09.763
[door opens]

07:13.475 --> 07:14.935
[cooing]

07:25.612 --> 07:27.906
- Look at my hat.
- [child squeals]

07:33.454 --> 07:35.789
What is it, sweetheart?

07:36.582 --> 07:38.417
[pained cooing]

07:43.088 --> 07:45.841
It's OK, son. These things
happen all the time...

07:46.008 --> 07:47.509
[birds squawking]

07:56.059 --> 07:57.352
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

08:04.276 --> 08:06.278

08:06.445 --> 08:08.989

08:14.077 --> 08:14.912
Justin!

08:18.248 --> 08:20.501
You bloody idiot!

08:25.547 --> 08:27.925
- [boy] Hurry! Run!
- [screaming continues]

08:33.054 --> 08:35.307
- [grunts]
- [tires screech]

08:36.975 --> 08:38.393

08:52.824 --> 08:53.951
[all screaming]

09:08.674 --> 09:10.717
[Child] Daddy!

09:18.892 --> 09:20.602
[sobs]

09:22.229 --> 09:24.565
<i>[man on TV] The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:26.984
<i>but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.</i>

09:27.150 --> 09:29.820
<i>Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds</i>

09:29.987 --> 09:31.697
<i>were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...</i>

09:31.863 --> 09:34.533
And it's not just this time.
No,no,no,no,no,no.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.494
The Fortean <i>Times</i> reported
violent bird swarms

09:37.661 --> 09:40.914
twice last month in Australia and Japan.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.793
<i>...this bizarre and terrifying incident
in London's historic Trafalgar Square.</i>

09:44.960 --> 09:46.044
- Weird.
- Mm-hm.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.463
- Quite strange, also.
- Mm. Strange, indeed.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.221
- How do birds navigate?
- [woman] By sight?

09:56.388 --> 09:59.725
- No, no, no, the long range stuff.
- [woman] Magnetic fields.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.228
Little ions in their brains align
with the magnetic field of the Earth.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.690
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

10:06.857 --> 10:11.153
Acker. Hit the Net, do a search for,
oh, two years ought to do it.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.364
Any and all, like, "weird news,"
you know, bizarre animal migrations,

10:14.531 --> 10:17.284
specifically birds.
Whale and dolphin beachings.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.287
Uh, unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

10:20.454 --> 10:23.206
- you know, just use your imagination.
- That is a huge search.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.418
You can use our T-1 line to look up
Sailor Moon crap. You're up to this.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.213
Danni, Danni, get me the brightest kids
from the Field Theory class

10:30.380 --> 10:32.382
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.718
- What are we doing?
- I need a 3-D computer model

10:34.885 --> 10:36.845
- of the Earth to lay the field over.
- Whoa, the planet Earth?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.514
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

10:40.223 --> 10:43.393
Map out the anomalies that Acker finds
and grunt out the equations.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.314
And... grab those smelly kids
from the Non-Linear Diff class, too.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.982
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.401
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.695
- [Danni] Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded. Do not pass Go.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.906
Go directly to PhD.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.539
Be wrong. Be wrong.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.716
[typing on keyboard]

12:00.512 --> 12:03.306
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.
Give me some drag, will you?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.766
Roger that.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.146
[clears throat]

12:13.817 --> 12:16.653
We are in attitude and ready
for entry interface.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.447
Nice work, Major.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.866
I have the controls now for E.I.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.160
I could take us in.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.662
You could... but you won't.

12:25.829 --> 12:29.666
- I'm ready for this, Bob.
- Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.628
You're trained, and you're certified.
Doesn't make you the commander.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.173
And the commander lands the bird.
You got to be the youngest person

12:36.339 --> 12:39.342
ever in space. You should say,
thank you, be happy. Now.

12:40.886 --> 12:44.473
[man] Endeavour, Houston, at this time
we show you go for re-entry.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.058
<i>[Beck] Houston, Endeavour descending
through 400,000 feet</i>

12:47.225 --> 12:50.771
<i>- coming upon entry interface.
- Endeavour, this is Flight.</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:53.565
Weren't able to annoy the commander
into letting you bring her in this time?

12:53.732 --> 12:55.859
That's a negative, Stick. I'll
have to be more annoying next time.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.694
- Is that even possible?
- [laughs]

12:57.861 --> 13:00.489
[man] Endeavour, we see you
in good entry config.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.865
<i>[Beck] Roger, Houston.</i>

13:05.869 --> 13:06.870
<i>[Tim] Advise.</i>

13:07.037 --> 13:09.039
<i>[Bob] I'm seeing
those plasma trails now.</i>

13:09.206 --> 13:11.875
<i>- [Tim] All right, mark 24 and a 1/2.
- [Bob] So, a minute to air.</i>

13:12.042 --> 13:13.710
<i>[Beck] I don't believe in belts.</i>

13:17.839 --> 13:20.675
<i>Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.</i>

13:20.842 --> 13:23.970
- [beeping]
- Com dropout.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.610
<i>- [Tim] Start the I Com.
- [Bob] Let's wait till the, uh...</i>

13:39.361 --> 13:40.487
Com restored.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.116
[alarm beeping]

13:48.495 --> 13:51.081
- [chattering]
- Quiet!

13:57.254 --> 13:58.755
We are out of position here.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.632
Guidance shows us on energy
and on course.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.468
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.345
- We're not where we should be.
- Where the hell are we?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.349
[Stick] Endeavour, guidance is bad.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.102
You are now 1-2-niner miles off course.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.437
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed. Is that...?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.523
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.025
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.069
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.280
Doesn't make sense. The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

14:23.446 --> 14:26.032
We're heading straight for downtown.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.742
We're not gonna crash
into Los Angeles.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.328
They're going to hit
downtown LA at 300 knots.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.000
Bob, you know LA?
Because I have an idea.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.127
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.589
- Can you clear a freeway?
- OK, thank you.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.132
Come on. Come on.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.261
It's rush hour, Commander,
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.474
Sir, I have an alternate.
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

14:51.641 --> 14:53.059
It's Houston's call. Houston?

14:55.645 --> 14:58.440
- Computers are still plotting.
- Come on.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.451
[rumbling]

15:09.618 --> 15:10.911
[crowd murmuring]

15:18.293 --> 15:19.961
Houston, we are running
out of time here.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.130
- Sir, I have an alternate.
- All right, Beck, what do you got?

15:22.297 --> 15:25.258
Houston, I have coordinates for an
alternate landing site. Can you confirm?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.677
<i>- Endeavour, give them to me.
- I show possible touchdown</i>

15:27.844 --> 15:30.889
<i>at 33-55 north, 1-18-10 west.</i>

15:33.183 --> 15:36.102
- [Stick] Bill?
- It's theoretically possible.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.021
<i>Endeavour, that is confirmed.</i>

15:38.188 --> 15:42.192
<i>Turn right, heading 1-7-5.
Expect visual contact</i>

15:42.359 --> 15:44.611
<i>with Los Angeles River in five seconds.</i>

15:49.866 --> 15:52.869
No, that will not work, Houston.
We got bridges every few hundred yards.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.663
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.456
I've figured the "L" over "D" max.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.166
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.417
We're coming in high and hot.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.384
Two-ninety feet, 320.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.135
- Two-seventy, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
- [Tim] Gear on.
- Gear down. Now.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.305
[Tim] Gear in transition.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.938
Two-forty feet, 290.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.232
[Bob] Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.487
Two-ten feet, 265.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.407
Get out of the way! Move!

16:33.994 --> 16:34.995
- Derotate.
- [Bob] Inward.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.461
- 230... 210...
- Speed brakes!

16:44.921 --> 16:46.589
- One hundred per cent.
- [Bob] We're way too fast.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.049
- Deploy the chute.
- No. We'd snag the bridge.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.217
We'll tear the tail off.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.805
Banking right.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.312
[Beck] Commander, that next bridge!

17:01.479 --> 17:03.273
Watch it! We're way too high
for that one!

17:04.065 --> 17:06.026
- Suck up the gear!
- Not yet. We'll lose all steering.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.944
We hit, it's over!

17:11.614 --> 17:13.657
And... gear up now!

17:19.789 --> 17:21.624
Lock your harnesses.
It's out of my hands.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.885
[all shouting]

17:38.308 --> 17:41.853
- Let's get out of here!
- Run! Let's get out!

17:46.274 --> 17:47.984
[grinder buzzing]

17:52.906 --> 17:54.908
' [grinder off]
' [gasps]

17:55.075 --> 17:56.951
- [Endeavour powering down]
- [exhales]

18:01.247 --> 18:02.916
[breathing deeply]

18:07.712 --> 18:09.923
[sirens approaching]

18:25.522 --> 18:26.773
[man] Dr. Zimsky?!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.566
Will you make sure my assistant
has your number, darling?

18:28.733 --> 18:29.692
Sure.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.278
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello. No, it's all right.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.239
- Hello.
- Thank you, sir.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.824
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

18:35.990 --> 18:37.283
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.411
No, sir, I don't need you to sign it.
I need you to read that.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.955
[laughs] I'm sorry, I don't have time.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.290
- I'm late for the White House, please.
- Sir...

18:44.457 --> 18:46.251
I need you to confirm my results, sir.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.628
Young man, do you have
any idea who I am?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.880
Yes, I do, sir. Please read this.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.882
[camera clicking]

18:53.049 --> 18:55.093
What's it about?

18:55.844 --> 18:57.428
It's the end of the world.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.724
[papers rustling]

19:20.493 --> 19:21.953
[sighs]

19:23.246 --> 19:26.583
No, I... this is impossible. I'm sorry.
[laughs]

19:26.749 --> 19:30.253
I... I can't have missed this.
You... You have to be wrong.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.006
I mean, look, I'm sure with careful
comparison to my own work,

19:33.173 --> 19:35.884
we'll find that you are mistaken.
No offence, but...

19:36.050 --> 19:37.844
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.931
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.658
[beeping]

20:42.116 --> 20:45.620
- Rebecca?
- Only you and Dad ever call me that.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.455
Right, Beck.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.375
So, what brings you to sunny D.C.?

20:50.541 --> 20:52.043
The Board of Review is next week.

20:54.045 --> 20:57.215
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

20:57.382 --> 21:01.094
- How bad is it?
- Your crew crashed the space shuttle.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.013
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.182
- Sir, this is my life.
- Well...

21:06.349 --> 21:08.893
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.187
It still is and has
always been my life.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.106
It's over.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.276
It's over, Rebecca.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.027
I'm sorry.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.488
- [elevator dings]
- [chattering]

21:20.655 --> 21:22.198
- [man] Really?
- It's like the 4th of July.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.826
- What the hell's the hurry here?
- [cell phone rings]

21:26.744 --> 21:30.665
Rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
Excuse me.

21:34.210 --> 21:38.423
- Purcell.
- Thomas, um, look...

21:40.383 --> 21:43.386
...it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

22:02.947 --> 22:06.242
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.247
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.916
Conrad Zimsky. Herr Zimsky.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.002
Superstar.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.922
Ahh. [exhales]

22:22.008 --> 22:24.260
I think I skipped drunk.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.512
Went right to hangover.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.890
[low-tempo music plays]

22:30.767 --> 22:32.643
I spoke with the kids.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.937
They don't sleep at night.

22:35.104 --> 22:39.817
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.572
- Is there any chance you're wrong?
- No. The sky, man.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.282
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

22:46.449 --> 22:50.286
- That's high-altitude static discharge.
- I know.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.497
[man] Dr. Keyes...

22:54.540 --> 22:56.667
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.713
Ahh! It's my best buddies. Hey!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.673
Why don't you join us for a drink?

23:02.840 --> 23:05.259
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.136
And if I were to say no?

23:07.303 --> 23:08.596
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

23:08.763 --> 23:12.058
- Well, we have no sense of humour.
- That's true.

23:13.351 --> 23:16.396
- Oh.
- And we're armed.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.025
Thank you.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.656
- [Tom] Dr. Keyes, welcome.
- Thank you.

23:26.823 --> 23:30.076
Dr. Zimsky informs us
that you made a useful contribution

23:30.243 --> 23:33.663
to his investigations, so he wanted you
to assist him with the briefing.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.165
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.168
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

23:39.335 --> 23:43.673
Now, why don't you begin,
and I'll fill in all the difficult bits.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.426
[clears throat]

23:47.009 --> 23:50.012
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.057
[sighs] Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.644
And let me explain why.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.523
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.359
It's made up of
electricity and magnetism,

24:03.526 --> 24:06.821
so it's called, creatively enough,
the electromagnetic field.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.240
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

24:09.407 --> 24:12.410
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

24:12.577 --> 24:16.205
- So this EM field is our friend.
- But now...?

24:16.372 --> 24:19.292
But now, that field is falling apart.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.211
- Why?
- [scoffs] Why?

24:24.005 --> 24:25.756
This here.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.720
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

24:34.098 --> 24:36.309
Uh... Quick and dirty.

24:37.727 --> 24:41.355
The thin skin, that's the Earth's crust.
That's what we live on.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.357
It's 30 miles thick.

24:43.524 --> 24:46.486
The meat here, call it the mantle.

24:46.652 --> 24:50.907
And forgetting all the funky
transitions, it's 2,000 miles thick.

24:52.575 --> 24:56.287
The core, the peach pit
in the centre, that's a tricky one.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.248
There's two parts:
the inner core and the outer core.

24:59.415 --> 25:03.586
Are you following me?
The inner core is...

25:03.753 --> 25:06.756
Well, it's a big solid chunk of iron,
we think.

25:06.923 --> 25:10.259
And that's surrounded by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.054
Yes, but, most importantly,

25:13.221 --> 25:16.098
this liquid is constantly spinning
in one direction.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.559
So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal

25:18.726 --> 25:22.021
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

25:22.188 --> 25:23.231
Right, so, Physics 101:

25:23.397 --> 25:25.942
Hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

25:26.108 --> 25:30.363
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine that drives the EM Field.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.616
And that's where we have our problem.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.618
This engine has stalled.

25:35.785 --> 25:39.288
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.959
- How could this have happened?
- [people murmuring]

25:44.669 --> 25:46.337
We don't know.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.550
What's the timeline here?

25:51.551 --> 25:53.427
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

25:53.594 --> 25:55.263
we'll start seeing isolated incidents.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.057
One plane will fall from the sky,
and then two, and then...

25:58.224 --> 26:01.477
...in a few months, anything,
everything electronic will be fried.

26:01.644 --> 26:04.981
Static discharges in the atmosphere
will create superstorms

26:05.147 --> 26:07.567
with hundreds of lightning strikes
per square mile.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.485
After that, it gets bad.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.865
The Earth's EM Field
shields us from the solar winds,

26:15.032 --> 26:19.495
which are a lethal blend of radioactive
particles and microwaves.

26:19.662 --> 26:22.999
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

26:23.165 --> 26:27.545
will literally cook our planet.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.171
Dr. Zimsky.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.967
- [clears throat]
- This is the sun.

26:34.051 --> 26:37.972
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

26:38.139 --> 26:39.599
- Would you?
- Mm-hm.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.862
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

26:53.029 --> 26:56.198
A full year, the field collapses...

26:56.365 --> 26:57.700
...and that.

27:02.872 --> 27:03.873
May I?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.960
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

27:09.253 --> 27:12.089
So... how do we fix it?

27:12.256 --> 27:14.175
- We can't.
- Not in my vocabulary.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.551
Then you might want
to get one of those

27:15.718 --> 27:18.220
word-a-day calendars, General,
because it's impossible.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.140
The core is the size of Mars. You're
talking about jumpstarting a planet.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.392
This is a superheated hyper-fluid

27:23.559 --> 27:26.103
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

27:26.270 --> 27:29.231
2,000 miles down, 1,000 miles thick.

27:29.398 --> 27:33.194
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

27:33.361 --> 27:35.613
- with a two-inch drill bit.
- If we can go into space,

27:35.780 --> 27:38.240
- we certainly...
- Well, space is easy. It's empty.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.077
We're talking about millions of pounds
of pressure per square inch.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.996
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

27:44.163 --> 27:47.375
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.169
[Zimsky] Yes, but...

27:55.758 --> 27:57.176
...what if we could?

28:49.019 --> 28:51.147
Hello, Braz.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.401
Why the hell aren't you dead yet?

28:56.819 --> 28:58.112
OK, this way.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.117
Oh. That went better than I expected.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.619
Dr. Brazzelton,
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

29:05.786 --> 29:09.415
Yeah. Twenty years ago,
he stole my research. [laughs]

29:09.582 --> 29:13.794
- After that, we kind of lost touch.
- Research that was equally mine.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.005
That's funny, I don't remember a cheque
from any of the patents.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.923
[sighing] All right, Braz,

29:18.090 --> 29:21.969
20 years in the desert
makes you a prophet and a martyr.

29:22.136 --> 29:24.555
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

29:24.722 --> 29:29.226
OK, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

29:29.393 --> 29:31.395
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

29:31.562 --> 29:34.440
If you've ever seen ultrasonic waves
break up a kidney stone

29:34.607 --> 29:36.942
on the Discovery Channel,
it's the same deal here.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.738
- Uh, you can put your helmets on now.
- [motor starting]

29:41.614 --> 29:43.365
- Firing.
- [powering up]

30:00.257 --> 30:01.884
[shouting]

30:06.013 --> 30:08.265
[shouting]

30:10.851 --> 30:12.895
[engine powering down]

30:15.189 --> 30:17.858
[Braz] Yeah. Oh.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.488
[coughing]

30:26.408 --> 30:27.910
[Spits]

30:30.788 --> 30:34.083
OK, I'm officially impressed.

30:41.465 --> 30:42.800
[Zimsky] Well, all right.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.679
So you've made some progress
with the engine, I will grant you.

30:47.596 --> 30:50.182
Uh, have you begun
to think about a shell?

30:50.349 --> 30:53.853
OK, this is Alex.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.521
OK, Alex. Good.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.649
OK, here we have a concrete block,

30:59.275 --> 31:03.237
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.951
- [engine powering up]
- OK. We're ready.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.376
And we are... firing.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.099
[engine powering down]

31:37.187 --> 31:39.690
- Voilà!
- That's...

31:41.317 --> 31:44.236
- That's impossible.
- [Braz] I combined the crystals

31:44.403 --> 31:47.948
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

31:48.574 --> 31:50.659
and that's what did the trick.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.120
The applications for this are just...

31:53.287 --> 31:55.497
What do you call this material?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.334
Well, its real name has 37 syllables.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.128
I call it Unobtanium.

32:01.295 --> 32:02.922
- Unobtanium?
- Mm-hm.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.383
The Unobtanium will take
the heat and the pressure

32:06.550 --> 32:07.927
and transform it to energy,

32:08.093 --> 32:10.220
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

32:10.387 --> 32:13.891
So the hotter and the deeper she gets,
the stronger she gets, theoretically.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.936
- [Zimsky] Theoretically?
- Theoretically, yes.

32:17.102 --> 32:20.773
This... is Johnson, don't mind him.

32:20.940 --> 32:24.318
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

32:24.485 --> 32:27.738
Excuse me, Dr. Brazzelton, when do you
think the ship will be operational?

32:27.905 --> 32:31.367
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.037
Twelve... ten years, ten years.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.831
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

32:40.292 --> 32:43.087
[laughing] Fifteen billion dollars. I...

32:45.798 --> 32:47.549
Will you take a cheque?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.594
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.137
Mm.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.808
[pounding]

32:56.934 --> 32:59.812
- [man 1] Shit!
- [man 2] Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.356
- We have a warrant.
- [pounding continues]

33:06.235 --> 33:07.987
- [Finch] Purge!
- [Computers beeping]

33:10.739 --> 33:12.116
Come on, purge!

33:25.170 --> 33:27.131
FBI! Freeze!

33:28.966 --> 33:29.967
[dings]

33:35.347 --> 33:36.974
[clattering]

33:37.141 --> 33:39.101
OK.

33:39.268 --> 33:43.647
I know these look like computers.
Totally not.

33:43.814 --> 33:47.943
Theodore Donald Finch.
Carnegie Mellon University. MIT.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.112
Worked at Sun, Lucent, RAND Corp.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.489
My handle's "Rat". Call me Rat.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.408
Sixty-three computer fraud indictments.

33:54.575 --> 33:56.285
Sixty-four.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.371
Two convictions.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.707
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.125
Wait a second.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.544
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

34:05.711 --> 34:09.590
Because I was really, really hoping
to have sex before that happened.

34:09.757 --> 34:14.803
Yeah. I've been told by the FBI,
whose database you crippled last year,

34:14.969 --> 34:18.306
that you are the best in the business.
So you're about to be given a choice.

34:18.474 --> 34:21.643
- What if I say no?
- Excuse me, but

34:21.810 --> 34:24.688
is this really the best we could do?
I mean...

34:24.855 --> 34:28.400
- How many languages do you speak?
- Five, actually.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.487
Well, I speak one.
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

34:32.654 --> 34:36.492
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

34:36.658 --> 34:38.994
your sexual fantasies, your whole life,

34:39.161 --> 34:43.456
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.000
We multitask like you breathe.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.212
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.092
- Do you have any idea...?
- OK, hey. Hey!

34:54.259 --> 34:56.929
Let's just, let's give the kid a break.

34:59.223 --> 35:02.434
OK, it's a phone. It's just a phone.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.230
Rat...

35:06.396 --> 35:09.900
...we got a big... problem.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.069
A lot of people are going to die.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.196
- We need your help.
- What kind of help?

35:14.363 --> 35:15.697
- [blows on wrapper]
- Information control.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.408
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.911
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the Net.

35:21.078 --> 35:24.790
Could you... with unlimited resources?

35:25.666 --> 35:27.417
You want me to hack the planet?

35:27.584 --> 35:29.086
[chuckles]

35:29.545 --> 35:31.380
- [dialing phone]
- He wants me to hack the planet.

35:31.547 --> 35:32.840
[blowing sounds]

35:33.006 --> 35:35.759
[phone dialing]

35:37.469 --> 35:41.181
You've got free long distance
on that phone... forever.

35:42.766 --> 35:46.520
OK. If I decide to do this,

35:46.687 --> 35:49.273
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

35:49.439 --> 35:52.025
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.821
- Hot Pockets?
- They help me concentrate.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.323
Sounds fair.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.701
[shoes squeaking]

36:05.581 --> 36:07.207
[door opens]

36:07.791 --> 36:10.085
[man] Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.006
[swallows]

36:14.173 --> 36:17.718
Major Childs, a clarification:

36:17.885 --> 36:19.219
You and you alone were responsible

36:19.386 --> 36:21.722
for proposing the descent vectors
for the shuttle, correct?

36:22.931 --> 36:24.308
Yes, General.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.727
[General] We have determined
that the Class "A" landing mishap

36:26.894 --> 36:28.228
experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour

36:28.395 --> 36:31.982
was caused by biased navigational data
from the ground

36:32.149 --> 36:34.735
due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.237
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

36:37.404 --> 36:39.114
in determining
the descent vectors proved

36:39.281 --> 36:42.868
that you have exceptional
navigational skills.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.953
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

36:45.120 --> 36:48.165
the space programme
and the United States Air Force.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.042
Congratulations, Major.

36:50.959 --> 36:54.630
You are reassigned with Commander
Iverson and Flight Director Stickley

36:54.796 --> 36:57.216
to a new mission, effective immediately.

36:57.382 --> 37:02.095
Transportation is waiting outside.
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.664
[chattering]

37:28.830 --> 37:30.499
[Serge] Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

37:30.666 --> 37:32.000
- [Josh] Why?
- [Serge] I don't know.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.919
I mean, you look so nervous about it.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.838
- You look so...
- So, how are you holding up?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.840
- Oh, hi.
- I'm good, I'm good.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.677
I'm about to tell a couple hundred
people the world is going to end.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.679
- Well...
- I've had better days.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.681
You look good.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.391
Well, no, you don't look good.

37:47.557 --> 37:49.518
Why did he touch his tie like that?

37:50.185 --> 37:52.312
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.147
Listen, wouldn't you rather I did this?

37:54.314 --> 37:55.732
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

37:55.899 --> 37:57.526
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

37:57.693 --> 38:01.196
Yes. Thomas, this is the most important
scientific operation in history.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.032
And given my status,
I feel that it's my job to present...

38:04.199 --> 38:06.535
Project Destiny was your job, Zimsky.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.537
And you went way beyond
authorised limits.

38:08.704 --> 38:10.038
And let me tell... let me tell you,

38:10.205 --> 38:14.209
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

38:14.376 --> 38:17.587
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.173
- Now, I have not finished checking...
- Excuse me.

38:22.134 --> 38:26.096
Rebecca... I'm so glad I was wrong.

38:26.263 --> 38:29.141
Right over left...
No, the other left, the other left.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.475
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

38:30.642 --> 38:31.852
Gentlemen.

38:32.019 --> 38:36.481
Commander Iverson, Major Childs,
this is your crew:

38:36.648 --> 38:39.359
- Dr. Brazzelton knows the ship.
- Hello.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.487
- [Tom] Dr. Zimsky knows the planet.
- Doctor.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.448
Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system.

38:44.614 --> 38:48.577
- Excuse me, ladies first. Hi.
- [Tom] And Dr. Keyes... [clears throat]

38:48.744 --> 38:50.871
Dr. Keyes built the navigation system.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.165
- So...
- Hi. Rebecca Childs.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.374
Bob Iverson.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.294
These are your fellow... fellow what?

38:57.461 --> 38:59.921
- Terranauts?
- [Stick] Hello.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.340
All this brain power over here

39:01.506 --> 39:03.050
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.802
- Y'all better come and join in.
- Yeah.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.431
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

39:09.598 --> 39:13.602
Yeah. It's official. I'm the
least-qualified person on this base.

39:13.769 --> 39:16.605
Dr. Keyes, I'm sure the people in charge
have every confidence in you.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.607
Well, the problem is that I'm in charge.

39:18.774 --> 39:21.610
- [chuckles] Yeah, I know.
- Can I help you?

39:21.777 --> 39:23.362
Yes, please.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.821
[clears throat]

39:25.447 --> 39:27.657
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

39:27.824 --> 39:29.159
Mm-hm.

39:29.326 --> 39:33.789
- Is there anything you can't do?
- Not that I'm aware of.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.042
I find that incredibly intimidating.

39:37.209 --> 39:40.128
Yep. Most people do.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.381
Here.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:47.052 --> 39:51.223
[Tom] Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.934
[Josh] Thank you, thank you.

39:54.101 --> 39:57.646
Good evening. Good evening.

39:57.813 --> 40:02.984
Wow. This looks like a meeting
for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.987
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

40:06.154 --> 40:08.365
and have come a long way to be here.

40:08.532 --> 40:12.869
So, I'll outline our programme
over the next three months.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.876
<i>Dr. Brazzelton will supervise
the building of a ship</i>

40:20.043 --> 40:22.546
<i>which is capable of reaching
the centre of our planet.</i>

40:22.712 --> 40:24.798
<i>Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge</i>

40:24.965 --> 40:27.384
<i>large enough to restart its core.</i>

40:29.469 --> 40:33.432
<i>Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale
of the explosion needed.</i>

40:33.598 --> 40:35.934
[Zimsky] This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

40:36.101 --> 40:39.020
of nuclear detonations on the core.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.357
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

40:42.524 --> 40:44.276
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.902
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

40:46.069 --> 40:48.738
- A thousand megatons, give or take?
- [Zimsky] Tops.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.324
Because any more than that
would create a core instability.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.202
[Serge] We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.622
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

40:57.789 --> 40:58.748
Yeah.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.001
- I can enlarge the ejection pod...
- [Bob] Forgive me,

41:01.168 --> 41:04.212
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

41:04.379 --> 41:07.007
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

41:07.174 --> 41:09.009
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

41:09.176 --> 41:11.052
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

41:11.219 --> 41:15.765
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
And what if the core is made of cheese?

41:15.932 --> 41:20.437
This is all best guess, Commander.
That's all science is, is best guess.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.732
So my best guess is you don't know.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.860
<i>[Josh] With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,</i>

41:27.027 --> 41:28.862
<i>and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction</i>

41:29.029 --> 41:30.655
<i>will help save the world.</i>

41:30.822 --> 41:34.701
<i>The ship will be powered by a small
experimental nuclear reactor.</i>

41:34.868 --> 41:38.413
<i>It will be divided into six compartments
like cars on a train:</i>

41:38.580 --> 41:40.624
<i>the locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,</i>

41:40.790 --> 41:43.835
<i>living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:46.338
<i>and finally the weapons-control module.</i>

41:47.214 --> 41:50.467
Up to a 45-degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

41:50.634 --> 41:54.888
by these gyro control gimbals.
But if we do breach a section,

41:56.056 --> 41:57.933
bulkhead doors engage automatically,

41:58.099 --> 42:01.269
seal off the section in red, and eject.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.940
- Is ejection really the best option?
- Only option.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.318
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.779
<i>[Josh] The objective is simple.</i>

42:10.946 --> 42:12.864
<i>The obstacles are gigantic.</i>

42:13.031 --> 42:15.283
<i>We're going to need
all the help in the world,</i>

42:15.450 --> 42:17.953
<i>but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,</i>

42:18.119 --> 42:20.872
<i>the world at large can never
know what's happening here.</i>

42:21.039 --> 42:23.083
<i>Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.</i>

42:23.250 --> 42:26.503
[Rat] It's called Virus-bot. It's a
computer virus that will seek out files

42:26.670 --> 42:29.464
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

42:29.631 --> 42:34.386
and wipes them out.
This is my kung fu, and it is strong.

42:34.553 --> 42:38.181
<i>[Josh] Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,</i>

42:38.348 --> 42:39.432
<i>and we have three months
to solve them.</i>

42:39.599 --> 42:41.685
<i>We have a committed
and ingenious team.</i>

42:41.851 --> 42:45.230
<i>We have every resource
available to us, and we have the best</i>

42:45.397 --> 42:47.691
<i>of the world's scientific
and technical talents on our side.</i>

42:47.857 --> 42:52.112
<i>With your help we can,
we must... succeed.</i>

42:52.696 --> 42:55.156
[indistinct conversations]

42:56.825 --> 42:58.910
- Feedback in the resonance tube.
- Talk to me, gentlemen.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.870
[Serge] We are losing
structural integrity.

43:01.037 --> 43:03.748
No, it's not feedback.
It's an impeller malfunction, I believe.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.417
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

43:05.584 --> 43:07.627
For God's sakes, Braz, make the call!

43:07.794 --> 43:09.546
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

43:09.713 --> 43:11.464
[Beck] Sixty-five knots!

43:11.631 --> 43:13.383
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

43:13.550 --> 43:14.676
L0ok,guys...

43:18.513 --> 43:19.556
It's a disaster!

43:19.723 --> 43:20.724
[laughing]

43:21.433 --> 43:23.560
[alarm blaring]

43:24.811 --> 43:27.689
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

43:27.856 --> 43:31.318
For the 22nd time in a row,
everyone on Earth is dead.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.237
Let's take a little quiet time,

43:34.404 --> 43:36.364
and you all are going
to try this again.

43:41.077 --> 43:44.789
- Hey
- Hi.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.084
What is this?

43:48.251 --> 43:51.880
Uh, well, it's... I invented it.

43:52.047 --> 43:55.008
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

43:55.175 --> 43:58.386
It's... not very good reception.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.180
[Josh] Well, uh, you're looking

44:00.347 --> 44:03.391
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

44:03.558 --> 44:04.809
...it ain't bad.

44:06.186 --> 44:10.899
It's like a CAT scan at a hospital,
but it's, uh, it's souped-up.

44:11.941 --> 44:13.485
I invented it
for deep earth surveying.

44:13.652 --> 44:15.904
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

44:16.071 --> 44:18.573
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

44:18.740 --> 44:22.702
I'm sorry, this is really delicate.
And I have it just the way I want it.

44:22.869 --> 44:26.790
So... excuse me.

44:26.956 --> 44:29.417
Uh... Yeah. Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

44:29.584 --> 44:32.587
and... boom, you know,
I'm Apocalypse Boy.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.090
Apocalypse Boy?

44:35.256 --> 44:38.677
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts made up.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.929
Well, hats sell better.

44:41.680 --> 44:46.101
You know, it's funny, because
that is right where it should be.

44:46.267 --> 44:47.310
Well...

44:47.477 --> 44:48.853
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.522
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

44:50.689 --> 44:54.234
- This is cool, but can I just...?
- Well... Mm-hm.

45:04.494 --> 45:08.123
It's better. It's better. Ah...

45:28.476 --> 45:30.729
[electrical zapping]

45:35.150 --> 45:37.652
God, I hate this sky.

46:10.018 --> 46:12.520

- [alarm blaring]

46:17.817 --> 46:19.360
[sighs]

46:20.111 --> 46:22.906
[Bob] Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

46:23.072 --> 46:24.699
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

46:26.576 --> 46:27.535
You can practise all you like.

46:27.702 --> 46:28.953
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit on that seat.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.873
So you keep reminding me, sir.

46:33.082 --> 46:34.793
You know, I doubt
you're even going to listen to this,

46:34.959 --> 46:36.044
but I'm going to give it a shot.

46:38.880 --> 46:43.092
Being a leader isn't about ability.
It's about responsibility.

46:44.219 --> 46:45.887
- Got it, sir.
- No, you don't, Beck.

46:46.054 --> 46:48.681
I mean, you're not just responsible
for making good decisions.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.226
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

46:52.268 --> 46:55.021
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

46:55.188 --> 46:57.398
- What makes you think I'm not?
- Because you're so good.

46:58.608 --> 47:01.569
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.988
I mean, hell, you were the one who
figured out how to save the shuttle.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.616
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

47:08.493 --> 47:11.412
It's just that
you're used to winning...

47:15.166 --> 47:17.836
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.425
<i>[Braz] $20 billion has been spent
developing this system...</i>

47:24.592 --> 47:26.594
<i>[Josh] Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...</i>

47:26.970 --> 47:29.639
- I wouldn't call them chefs.
- [all arguing]

47:29.806 --> 47:30.932
I want wine! I need wine!

47:31.099 --> 47:33.601
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

47:33.768 --> 47:35.395
- Whoa!
- [Zapping]

47:37.772 --> 47:40.108
That's high-level static discharge.

47:43.194 --> 47:46.823
I think we should check this out.
This doesn't look so good.

47:49.242 --> 47:51.661
[rapid chattering]

47:55.123 --> 47:56.374
[Josh] It's a lightning superstorm.

47:56.541 --> 48:00.712
- Popping up all over the world.
- Got 'em. Tracking.

48:02.922 --> 48:05.967
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

48:07.010 --> 48:09.012

This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

49:59.956 --> 50:01.582
It's just the start.

50:01.749 --> 50:04.419
Soon they'll be EM spikes and microwaves
will break through the weak spots and...

50:04.627 --> 50:08.297
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

50:20.768 --> 50:22.228

50:42.457 --> 50:44.250
Yeah, the world is inside out.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.900
[Serge] I was saving this
for later, but...

51:09.817 --> 51:12.403
- ...this is the time for...
- [laughs]

51:12.570 --> 51:14.947
- Josh, do you mind?
- No, not at all. Yeah.

51:16.157 --> 51:17.617
We should have a name
for this baby.

51:17.784 --> 51:19.660
- Oh, she's called Virgil, actually.
- Virgil,

51:19.827 --> 51:21.788
the poet that led our man
into the depths of hell?

51:21.954 --> 51:23.206
- That's it.
- That's appropriate, I guess.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.083
Well, here's to <i>Virgil.</i>

51:26.459 --> 51:28.336
To the planet.

51:28.503 --> 51:29.504
<i>[all] To Virgil.</i>

51:36.761 --> 51:41.182
No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering. It's... weird.

51:44.143 --> 51:45.186
Let's go.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.587

52:11.754 --> 52:14.257
- Check.
- Fluid dump valve.

52:14.423 --> 52:18.344
We are about to begin our journey
into the heart of the cosmos...

52:18.511 --> 52:21.264
- [Bob] Close.
- ...Into the core of our own planet.

52:21.430 --> 52:23.432
- Where we find therein...
- [Beck] Check.

- [Bob] And signal.
- Deep Earth Control, this is <i>Virgil.</i>

52:35.987 --> 52:39.157
- Signal check.
- This is Deep Earth Control.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.951
I have thumbs-up across the board.

52:42.118 --> 52:44.245
You are clear to initiate power-up.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.256
Reactor power confirmed.

<i>[Stick] At 1,000 rpm, we will

<i>All right, Virgil.</i>

53:07.268 --> 53:11.105
- Mark.
- Gantry count. Ten, nine,

53:16.360 --> 53:20.198
...three, two, one... launch.

53:53.814 --> 53:57.109
- Five hundred feet.
- Leveling out.

54:08.871 --> 54:11.958
OK, guys, let's swing forward.

54:17.672 --> 54:21.217
- Eight hundred feet.
- Light 'em up, Beck.

54:24.345 --> 54:25.596
[beeping]

54:25.763 --> 54:28.933
- Gyro leveling operational.
- Hull integrity holding.

55:00.006 --> 55:02.883
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

55:03.050 --> 55:06.053
- [whale sounds]
- Oh, my goodness.

55:28.909 --> 55:29.994
They're singing to us.

55:30.161 --> 55:33.789
Virgil's resonance tubes are powered up,
so they're vibrating subsonically.

55:33.956 --> 55:36.375
Actually, we're singing to them.

55:36.542 --> 55:38.711
[hull creaking]

55:49.889 --> 55:50.973
What's our depth?

55:51.140 --> 55:53.726
Sixteen hundred feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

55:53.893 --> 55:56.270
- Hull integrity is good.
- You sure?

55:56.437 --> 55:59.231
Let's increase impeller speed. I think
we'll be needing additional control.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.570
- [beeping]
- Stick, I'm getting a seismic reading.

56:04.737 --> 56:08.616

- T-phase. Underwater earthquake.

56:08.783 --> 56:10.409
[rumbling]

56:15.039 --> 56:16.499
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

56:16.665 --> 56:19.543
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

56:19.710 --> 56:22.338
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

56:22.505 --> 56:23.547
Four thousand feet.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.928
You see that rock?
That is not good.

56:36.727 --> 56:39.271
We're losing steering here.
There's some kind of crosscurrent.

56:41.315 --> 56:42.483
Fourteen thousand feet.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.874
OK, guys, fasten your seat belts.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.835
We're turning into the skid.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.347
Eighteen thousand.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.725
- Eighteen-five.
- They're going way too fast.

57:16.892 --> 57:18.686

57:31.574 --> 57:33.367
- Twenty-one thousand feet.
- We hit the wall,

57:33.534 --> 57:34.785
we're rabbits on the highway.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.162
[Braz] Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

57:36.328 --> 57:38.664
What do you mean, pressure? I thought
you said this thing was indestructible!

57:38.831 --> 57:41.375
I said the pressure makes us stronger.
We just don't have enough of it yet.

57:43.419 --> 57:45.296
We're at 25,000 feet. Pull out, sir.

57:45.463 --> 57:46.797
- Can't.
- What?

57:46.964 --> 57:48.549
- We're locked in.
- Go to full throttle.

57:50.509 --> 57:53.387
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.724
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

57:56.891 --> 57:59.977
Just give it a couple of more seconds.
The lasers will fire.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.441
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.280
Twenty-seven thousand feet.

58:11.447 --> 58:13.199
[Braz] The lasers will deploy.

58:15.993 --> 58:17.161
Twenty-nine thousand feet.

58:17.328 --> 58:18.996
- Do it!
- And...

58:20.539 --> 58:21.957
- Do it!
- Now.

58:35.596 --> 58:37.014
[monitor beeps]

- Speed is 60 knots.

59:33.821 --> 59:35.781
[laughs] Hot damn.

59:35.948 --> 59:39.243
All right, we'll be through the crust
in 15 minutes and into the mantle.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.787
Twenty-four hours to the core,
and then assuming we survive...

59:41.954 --> 59:44.123
- Assuming?
- Yes, assuming.

59:44.290 --> 59:47.418
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

59:47.585 --> 59:48.419
[beeping]

59:48.586 --> 59:52.047
- They're doing well.
- The crust is just rock.

59:52.548 --> 59:54.049
Now, it gets interesting.

59:54.216 --> 59:55.593
<i>Virgil, can we get a status check?</i>

59:55.759 --> 59:57.970
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

- Come on, come on.

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:44.516
[exhales]

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:48.646
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds per square inch.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.482
And hull integrity is 100 per cent.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:55.486
It's as if we we're diving
through the memories of the planet.

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:59.990
But we are about to pass
from memory into madness.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.201
Are you going to be doing

01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:04.745
that Carl Sagan narration
all the way to the core?

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:07.289
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.583
[stammers] I have an obligation
to my students...

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.210
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:12.836
[Zimsky] Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.547
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:17.508
[Zimsky] Oh, really? Really?
When did you learn how to read?

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:18.509
[Braz] You amaze me.

01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:39.446
[Bob] People.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:42.950
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.871
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.373
What do you make of this?

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.002
The mantle is a chemical hodgepodge
of... a variety of elements...

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:57.881
Say it with me: "I don't know."

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:02.219
Well, Commander, wise men say,
"When in doubt, you should go around."

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.055
No. It's too big. We turn too slow.

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.725
Anything that we can't go through
displays as black.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.812
- So, what's... what's static?
- It's nothing.

01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:16.316
- What do you mean?
- It's nothing.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.319
It's empty space.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.989
L.-

I never taught the computer how
to read empty space.

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:26.785
And I never taught <i>Virgil</i>
how to fly.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.413
Oh, God!

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.347
[all grunting]

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.479
Oh, no, man!

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.285
[Bob] Oh, dear God.

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:17.836
[grunts]

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.137
[shouts]

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.188
[groaning]

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:42.861
Ah!

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:44.530
[screams]

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.460
[all grunting, panting]

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.296
Serge, you all right?

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.466
Yeah.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:14.518
- Anybody hurt?
- No. You OK?

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.686
- Yeah.
- [craft hissing]

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.145
What's that? What is that?

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.691
From the cooling system.
Shut that down. Shut it down.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:23.777
I told you to go around her.
Nobody listens to me.

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:25.112
Where in God's name are we?

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:28.574
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers. Shut 'em down.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.829
We're not going anywhere.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.793
Powering down.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.212
[ship powers down]

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.135
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:52.973
Nope. Whatever it is,
it's also inside our MRI cameras.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.685
- We have to go outside.
- [Serge] What?

01:04:56.852 --> 01:05:00.063
Believe me, I hate to admit it,
but I think he's right.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:02.149
- I'm coming. I want to collect samples.
- [Bob] Wait, hang on, hang on.

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:04.276
The first problem is,
the only way out of the ship

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:07.446
is the way we came in,
which is through the impeller outlet...

01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:10.157
- Which is still at 5,000 degrees.
- Exactly, I mean...

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:13.827
I'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen
from the cooling system.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:17.831
Wait. The cooling system that's keeping
us from roasting to death in this ship?

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:21.460
Well, just a small part of it.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:28.258
Alternatives? Anybody.

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.606
[heavy breathing]

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.192
[Bob] Whoa, whoa, that's it.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:48.862
[Josh] It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:51.865
- [Zimsky] Where the hell are we?
- [Bob] Well, the good news is,

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.951
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:57.871
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:00.374
We just... we got to hope,
if we can cut it loose,

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.667
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:03.752
OK.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:05.712
Got it.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:09.424
- Beck, try the lights, will you?
- Lighting up.

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:17.099
- Oh, it's magnificent.
- [Zimsky] Oh, my God.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:20.268
[Braz] Aladdin's cave.

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:23.730
[Zimsky] It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.080
I think it's a geode.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:44.167
But I don't understand
how it could have survived down here.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.170
- Cobalt shell, maybe?
- [Zimsky] Well, I mean,

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.756
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.634
Something would have to protect it.
Unbelievable.

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:54.886
- Zimsky.
- Yeah?

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:58.265
We're inside a giant gem bubble,

01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:00.976
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.021
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.401
- Hell of a day.
- [Zimsky laughing]

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.403
Yes, it is.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:12.946
- [Braz] I'll start cutting.
- [Bob] OK, Braz.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:15.198
I'm going to check the hull.
Call me if you need me.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.867
- OK.
- [tool powering up]

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.620
[Zapping]

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:22.247
[hissing]

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.751
Oh, no.

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:27.961
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:30.589
- Zimsky...
- Look! It's an amethyst.

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.301
[Zimsky] Oh, God,
we've breached the shell.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:42.809
[shouts]

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.479
- [gasps]
- [all shouting]

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:53.528
Guys, you don't have to be here!
I want you back inside!

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:57.074
Well, I think that means me.
Orders are orders.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.042
Wait, Josh.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:09.503
The problem is I'm losing oxygen.

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:12.172
- Braz, what can I do?
- Check the feeds for me.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.675
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:20.305
Quick!

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:21.640
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:25.227
Hey, guys, at this rate we have three
minutes before the lava gets to us.

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.187
Come on, guys. Come on.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:32.943
[beeps]

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.736
[Braz] It's not going to work
without oxygen!

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.863
We're losing oxygen!

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.907
[air hissing]

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.082
I fixed it. Now cut!

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:50.127
[Braz] That's good. It's working now.
It's working well now!

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.002
That's good, Josh!

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:06.225
- Josh's vital signs are dropping.
- What?

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.647
[exhales]

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.567
Serge!

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:20.823
[Braz] You're almost there.
You're almost there, Josh.

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:34.587
- [grunts]
- Josh!

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.884
[grunting]

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.519
[grunts]

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:54.774
- Joshua!
- OK, guys, connect the oxygen.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.985
- [Bob] Braz, you got that?
- [Braz] Yes. Connected!

01:09:57.152 --> 01:09:59.154
<i>[Bob] Good. I got to check these lasers.</i>

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.908
OK, Beck, turn 'em over.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.493
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.786
Initiating.

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:12.083
This better work.
The tide's really coming in.

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:14.920
Yes!

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.548
We got lucky! I think we're going
to swim right out of this one.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.844
Bob?

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:24.763
[gasps]

01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:35.774
[long beep]

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:40.278
Bob?

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.494
Bob...

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.916
Braz, come on, it's over.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.502
OK. OK.

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:57.337
Beck! Beck!

01:10:57.963 --> 01:10:59.631
<i>We're coming in.</i>

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:02.509
<i>[panting] Initiate start sequence.</i>

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:04.135
Beck!

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:06.554
- Beck, do you hear me?
- [Serge] Careful.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:08.974
<i>Start the impellers!</i>

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:13.979
The door, open the door.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.690
<i>Activate bulkhead doors!</i>

01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:19.234
<i>Now, Beck!</i>

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:55.478
[gasps]

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:02.193
You OK? You're going to be weak.
You're OK.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.695
Good job, good job. Good man.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.905
- Well done, well done.
- [Josh] I'm fine. Thank you.

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:11.244
So... we have some good news, and...

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:12.620
...and we have some bad news.

01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:14.331
Good news.
I'll take good news.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:18.376
- All right.
- Well, we're alive and we're moving.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.712
That's g... that's good news.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.381
Oh, it is hot in here.

01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:26.760
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the
cooling system, it's causing things

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.804
just to heat up a little. I'm going
to go back and make some adjustments.

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.891
- I'll lend you a hand.
- I'm fine.

01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:35.268
[Beck] I'm going to check
your heartbeat, OK?

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.729
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:42.067
So, that's the bad news?
That's not too bad.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:45.779
No. Commander Iverson died.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:51.576
But... we're living,
and he would want to...

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:53.036
He'd want us to
complete our mission,

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:56.498
so I think that it's
important that we all...

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:04.214
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:06.633
I'm sorry.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:13.848
Let's give him a second, OK?
He deserves that.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.649
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.528
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:29.489
You were trying
to save the world, and...

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:32.117
...it's overwhelming.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.161
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:39.999
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:44.254
I just hope I'm smart enough
and brave enough to save three.

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:48.925
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:51.886
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Well, maybe, maybe.

01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:05.942
Hey... who's steering the ship?

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:10.196
- Video screen autopilot.
- I hope he knows the way.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:12.240
You and me both.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:19.330
So... you're really
a college professor?

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:24.335
You're not from the CIA or the NSA
or any of those three-letter places?

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:27.714
No. I am a boring college professor.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:30.884
Wrong place, wrong place.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:35.472
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:39.851
Well, I just, I just...
Listen, the lack of oxygen

01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:41.978
kept me from weeping
like a little girl,

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:45.315
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:57.327
[Beck] Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.453
Where are you?

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.247
[Serge] Key's in, Dr. Brazzelton.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:04.542
- Ready.
- [Josh] We are in the

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.169
- luxurious, beautiful...
- [Serge] OK, the code...

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:10.131
...weapons control
checking the controls on the nukes.

01:15:10.298 --> 01:15:11.758
[Serge] This is
the birthday of my daughter.

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:14.177
[Braz] O-3-1-9-9-5.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:18.598
- Ready? Three, two and one.
- Yeah.

01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:21.309
Thank you.

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:22.477
Green. All green.

01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:26.105
Great. So we have
to synchronise the babies now.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.487
Just a second.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.364
- There.
- Mm-hm.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.658
All right, now let's
put them to bed.

01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:40.995
Zimsky, could you please come up
here for a second?

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.331
- Yes?
- We're not supposed

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:46.376
- to go through anything black.
- Yes, so please don't.

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:47.961
What is this?

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:51.381
[Zimsky] They're scattered everywhere.

01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:56.553
Oh, my God! They're diamonds!

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:59.013
[Beck] Great.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:03.142
You might want to sit down and buckle
up. We're on a collision course here.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.651
Alrighty. Careful.

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:19.742
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.619
Not exactly nimble here.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:24.330
- Diamonds? I want some.
- Can I help?

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.438
Oh!

01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:52.984
- [thudding]
- OK. It's OK.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.989
[Beck] OK, it looks like
we're in the clear.

01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.662
- [scraping]
- [alarm beeping]

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:05.788
Breach!

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.792
Guys! Weapons control, get out!
Get out now!

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.429
[Josh] Serge!

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:28.227
Serge! What the hell are you doing?
Come on!

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:31.064
[$6rge] My notebook!

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:35.860
Serge!

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:44.285
Take the time reg, Joshua!

01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:48.206
- Come on Serge! Come on!
- My notes! You'll need them!

01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:51.125
No! God, no, Serge!

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:54.337
- It's OK.
- Serge, come on! No!

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.631
Serge!

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.883
We need the box!

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.551
[Braz shouting]

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:02.345
We can get him!
We can get him!

01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:04.847
Hold on, Serge!

01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:22.949
Beck! Beck!
Override the ejection system!

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.328
Beck, no! One damaged compartment
threatens the whole ship!

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.498
Beck! Beck!

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.627
<i>Override the ejection system!</i>

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:43.052
Serge, we're right here. We're not
going to forget about you, man.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.762
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:47.056
Hey, buddy, look in your monitor
right now. Serge, look in your monitor.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:51.394
<i>- I'm right here. Serge...
- Josh, I can't see you.</i>

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:53.855
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, OK?

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.482
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:59.569
Going as fast as I can,
fast as I can.

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.738
- OK, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.365
- Shouldn't be two seconds, all right?
- <i>Josh!</i>

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:07.034
Beck, override
the ejection systems, OK?

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.662
<i>Damn it. I don't think
Beck can hear me.</i>

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:11.748
<i>Serge, look at me now. Serge!</i>

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:14.459
Serge, we're right here, OK? We're not
going to forget about you, man.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:18.045
I'm going to get you out of here.
We're working on it, all right?

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:22.633
- Stay with me here. OK?
- [sobs] I don't know what to do.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.635
You can hear me now?
All right, here I am.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:28.806
I'm not going to let you go, man. I'm
not going to let you go, all right?

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:31.100
<i>Stay with me here, OK?</i>

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:35.521
I'm going to come to Paris
and we'll go out, all right? After this.

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:37.231
After this is all
said and done, all right?

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:39.025
- <i>Josh!</i>
- Serge!

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:44.030
- Serge! Serge! Serge!
- [Serge screaming]

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:46.199
<i>Serge _/</i>

01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:07.595
[sighs]

01:20:09.764 --> 01:20:12.225
- [inhales sharply]
- [kicking console]

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.087
Did you reset the overrides?

01:20:44.215 --> 01:20:46.050
I never pushed them.

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:48.761
You let him die.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:54.183
Actually, you really want to know?
I killed him twice.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.894
First when I hit the diamond, and then
when I didn't hit the override.

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:59.272
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:00.439
It's not possible.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.899
Why are you being so smug about that?

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.901
- Could you have made the decision?
- [Josh] Yes.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:05.236
- Could you?
- Yes, I could've.

01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:07.613
If you would've hit that switch,
I could've got him outta there!

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.490
I was yelling for you!

01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:15.288
Take it and look at it!

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:18.666
I was two inches from him!

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:22.253
I was two inches, and I told you
to put the door up and you didn't!

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:26.257
I was screaming for you!
Why didn't you do it?!

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:31.012
Because I had to make that decision.
Fate or God...

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:33.973
No! Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.309
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:37.935
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:42.481
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:33.157
- [monitor beeping]
- [quiet chattering]

01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:37.078
Virgil, you are approaching
core interface. Are you good to go?

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:39.038
[Braz] Josh?

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:40.831
Josh, can you hear me?

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:45.461
Josh, can you hear me?

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:52.468
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.387
Dr. Keyes.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.348
Right here.

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.396
Deep Earth, we are green
and good to go.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:46.689
We just got a huge speed jump.
We're at 95 knots...

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:47.815
...110...

01:23:47.982 --> 01:23:50.484
...13O... 140.

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:53.946
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:56.532
is different than our estimates.
It's lighter than we thought.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.617
- So much for best guesses.
- [Beck] I'm fine with this.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.037
At this rate, we'll,
what, hit the inner core

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:04.498
in a little over five hours.
I think we finally bought some luck.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.042
- Braz.
- Yeah.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.918
Would you please punch
the new core density into the equations

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:10.129
for the nuclear detonation?

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.011
Please tell me this is enough.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:24.769
- Failure.
- [Beck] You're telling me

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:26.687
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:28.647
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:32.151
No. This core material is too thin.

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:33.652
- What?
- [Zimsky] The energy waves from

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:34.904
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:36.405
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:41.535
[exhales, stammers]

01:24:42.203 --> 01:24:43.204
That's it.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:47.500
- We go home. We go home.
- [Josh] Home?

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:51.003
Our commander is dead.
Our weapons specialist is dead.

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.880
Our weapons control systems are gone.

01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:55.591
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:59.220
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So... we have failed.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:00.429
We have not failed.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:05.184
We have failed, and we go home,
and we go to the alternative.

01:25:05.351 --> 01:25:06.685
What alternative?
What are you talking about?

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:09.522
General, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:10.606
Destiny is a go.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:13.275
<i>Repeat. Destiny is a go.</i>

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:14.860
[sighs] Damn.

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:22.493
I need to know
everything to do my job.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.870
You don't have to know this.

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:29.583
General, it is my job
to ensure the safety of this mission.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:33.379
Anything that affects it is my business.
Now what the hell is Destiny?

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:35.422
It's a device.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:41.137
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:45.558
We had reason to believe that our
enemies were building a weapon

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.977
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:53.274
They would be able to create massive
earthquakes under our territory.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.067
- No way of telling who did it.
- So?

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.027
So... we built one, too.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:01.490
M.A.D. Mutually Assured Destruction.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.534
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

01:26:03.701 --> 01:26:05.411
- Beautiful.
- They built it first.

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:07.788
I built it better.
I beamed high-powered

01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:10.624
electromagnetic energy waves
down Deep Earth fault lines,

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.460
- and, you know.
- Zimsky, what makes you think

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:17.089
- that Destiny would touch the core?
- [Josh] 'Cause it already did.

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:22.761
This isn't a fluke.
We killed the planet.

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:24.847
[Beck] You keep saying
that the core is too big

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.682
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.642
- So...
- The core is an engine.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.395
Throw a small wrench into a big engine,
you can still stall it.

01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:35.691
<i>Deep Earth, this is Virgil.</i>

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:40.154
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:43.991
- Why weren't we notified of this, sir?
- Because you didn't need to know.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:47.953
<i>Now you may not like this.
I may not like it either.</i>

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.623
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:53.417
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

01:26:53.584 --> 01:26:56.462
and they will use them against us.
But you have my word.

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:59.506
No one in this
administration, no one,

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:01.967
had any idea
that this could happen.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:05.512
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:09.850
An electric shock can stop a heart.
It can certainly restart one.

01:27:10.017 --> 01:27:13.812
- Destiny will work. It has to.
- No, it won't work.

01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:16.190
If you fire that thing again
with the core already stalled,

01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:18.108
- it'll terminally destabilise it.
- Yes, granted,

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:20.903
there is a marginal risk involved,
but given the circumstances,

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:23.280
- I hardly see that as an alternative.
- No, Zimsky, listen to me.

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:24.907
Every volcano on the planet will blow.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:27.034
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:28.577
- <i>[Tom] Dr. Keyes.</i>
- What?

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.455
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

01:27:31.622 --> 01:27:34.917
Now, I have orders from the president.
Come home, <i>Virgil.</i> We go to plan B.

01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.628
- Well, what about plan C?
- What? What?

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.549
Well, plan C. We continue on.
We restart the core... somehow.

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:45.261
We don't do it, you fire Destiny.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:46.720
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:49.974
- Then don't. We fail, fire Destiny.
- Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.017
- What choice do we have, Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.520
If they set that thing off,
the shock waves will wipe us out!

01:27:54.687 --> 01:27:56.814
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

01:27:56.981 --> 01:28:00.150
Virgil, I'm telling you right now,
we will fire Destiny,

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.236
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

01:28:02.403 --> 01:28:05.572
and if you're still there,
you will be destroyed.

01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:07.366
<i>Rebecca ?</i>

01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:09.868
Please don't make me
have to do this.

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:17.626
Plan C.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:21.964
It's your call, Commander.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.139
Majority decision.

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:32.808
We're going in.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:34.226
I'm sorry, sir.

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:40.441
Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal
morons! What are you, crazy?

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.068
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.821
Oh, that's a great idea!
That's a brilliant idea!

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:48.490
I can't believe I'm stuck in this
floating septic tank with you lunatics!

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.993
You may have nothing to lose.
You may have nothing to lose!

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.078
You may have nothing to lose,
but I have my life to lose,

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:55.414
thank you very much,
while you're up! Now turn it around!

01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:57.124
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

01:28:57.291 --> 01:28:59.001
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

01:28:59.168 --> 01:29:00.878
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.671
- Thank you! Turn it around!
- No!

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:03.881
- Zimsky.
- I'm not gonna die like this!

01:29:04.048 --> 01:29:06.675
- I don't wanna die!
- Zimsky, it's not about you!

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:08.969
- If you wanna die like this...
- ...three people...

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:10.846
Shut up!

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:16.268
[panting]

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.228
It's not a stupid ship.

01:29:20.064 --> 01:29:21.398
I had to.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:27.821
- It had to happen sometime.
- Yeah.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.454
- [computer beeping]
- Um...

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:38.332
- Status! What is that?
- [Rat] It's the EM monitoring station.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.459
It's the one that tracks EM pulses.

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:43.087
God, no.

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:45.422
[sighs]

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.217
- Just talk, Mr. Rat.
- [Rat] No.

01:29:48.384 --> 01:29:51.011
- That's a good boy.
- Um...

01:29:51.178 --> 01:29:54.640
Remember those invisible microwaves
that Josh was talking about?

01:29:54.807 --> 01:29:57.810
Well, they just found a hole.

01:30:15.869 --> 01:30:17.913
[water boiling]

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.435
No, it's a parking lot out here...

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.186
- [sizzling sound]
- [screams]

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:49.027
[sizzling sounds continue]

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.367
Oh, my God.

01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:01.582
[rumbling]

01:31:04.585 --> 01:31:07.004
- [sizzling sounds continue]
- [gasps]

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.343
[screams]

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:18.390
[people screaming]

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:31.904
<i>[woman on TV] And now with this
horrific breaking news,</i>

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.532
<i>we go live to San Francisco,

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:37.659

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:40.120

<i>Thousands are dead.

01:31:50.547 --> 01:31:53.675

- [typing]
- [computer beeping]

01:31:57.054 --> 01:31:59.056
The whole West Coast is out.

01:32:01.308 --> 01:32:03.852
That means we're going to have
to suck up just about every drop

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:06.772
of juice east of the Rockies
to fire Destiny.

01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:09.942
Another EM spike, we're not
going to have enough power.

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:13.570
General, you have got
to give them more time.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:17.032
[Tom] There is no more time.
Colonel, call Destiny.

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:19.243
I am launching
a formal complaint against you

01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:21.286
- with the Department of Defense.
- Rat to Josh.

01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:22.538
Go, Rat.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:26.792
Hey, here's the EM field data
that you're primed for.

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:29.294
Digging that, Rat.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:31.713
Primed for. Primed for.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.591
Prime numbers...

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:36.969
One, two, three, five,

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:39.137
seven, 11, 13, 17...

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.523
[typing]

01:33:00.951 --> 01:33:02.369
[typing]

01:33:03.829 --> 01:33:04.663
Here we go.

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:17.050
[electrical zapping]

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.351
[telephone ringing]

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.354
[man] James.

01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:35.944
[exhales]

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:37.696
Yes, sir.

01:33:39.698 --> 01:33:41.033
Yes, sir.

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:42.868
Here we go, folks.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.370
[Josh] OK, this time it's going to work.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:47.789
Here you go... beautiful. Yeah. Mm-hm.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:51.918
Come on, baby. Come on,
Daddy wants to see the sky again.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:57.549
OK, OK, OK. Let's try again.

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:00.969
- Your torque is R, cross F...
- No, your R is too small, Josh.

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:02.971
- Right.
- Wait, hold on.

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:04.139
[Zimsky laughing]

01:34:04.306 --> 01:34:06.308
- What are you laughing at?
- No, I mean,

01:34:06.475 --> 01:34:08.560
it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:10.646
- to come up with the first plan.
- You want to help?

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:13.357
No. I want to turn around and go home.

01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:16.777
- It's not going to happen.
- Well, then we're going to die.

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:19.404
- True.
- All right, look

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.073
- let's start from square one.
- OK.

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:25.243
Let's start from square one. The bulk
modules... depends on density.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:30.832
Your torque is R cross F,
but you have to integrate volume...

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:35.045
But here, here...
just consider this.

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:39.049
Now, we got this...

01:34:39.216 --> 01:34:43.178
OK, now, R cross F,
we're putting put in pi. What's V?

01:34:44.888 --> 01:34:47.724
- Oh, for God's sake!
- All right. I'm hitting him again.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:50.894
No, no, no!
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:54.022
- Are you interested?
- Yes. We're interested.

01:34:54.815 --> 01:34:57.067
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.037
- Oh, thank God.
- [Braz whistles]

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:13.625
Hm? All right, fine, look. Look,
we have to use wave interference, OK?

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:16.586
Because one explosion won't do it.
Think about stones in a pond.

01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:19.798
You drop a large stone into a pond,
you get a big splash,

01:35:19.965 --> 01:35:21.425
and then that's it, it's over.

01:35:21.591 --> 01:35:25.303
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:28.098
and drop another and another,
and another,

01:35:28.265 --> 01:35:30.642
and fluid dynamics 101.

01:35:31.435 --> 01:35:34.312
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:36.231
[Braz] The whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

01:35:36.398 --> 01:35:39.484
Then we'll have five
200 megaton explosions...

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.069
Instead of one big bang.

01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:44.698
- [Josh] So, we hotwire the nukes.
- Yes.

01:35:44.865 --> 01:35:47.033
As one does.
We seed them through the core

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.078
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:52.998
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:54.416
to the millisecond,

01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:58.837
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:01.381
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:04.801
I mean, that should be fairly simple.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:07.888
[alarm blaring]

01:36:12.434 --> 01:36:15.020
[man 1] ...should now be
diverting to the central...

01:36:15.187 --> 01:36:18.023
[man 2] Final calibration
on both transmission systems...

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:19.191
[indistinct chatter]

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:25.280
[computer beeps]

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:30.118
Cut the... cut the rouge.
The red wire above the circuit.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:32.204
- OK. OK.
- No, no, wait, hold it!

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:33.538
I'm sorry, cut it below.

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:39.711
- [computer beeps]
- I don't know what that means.

01:36:44.049 --> 01:36:45.550
[man 1] Extensions A, B.

01:36:45.717 --> 01:36:48.887
- [man 2] Here we go.
- [man 1] F, check. Increase power

01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:51.014
- to reactors ten through 15.
- We're almost there, folks.

01:36:51.181 --> 01:36:52.599
[typing]

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:11.785
[computer beeping]

01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:23.255
- [typing]
- [beeping continues]

01:37:44.317 --> 01:37:46.111
[Beck] OK, guys we're closing
on the inner core.

01:37:46.278 --> 01:37:47.946
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.

01:37:49.573 --> 01:37:52.742
- Great. Let's start dropping them.
- No. The bombs are not built

01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:55.078
for these pressures.
That's why they were in that pod.

01:37:55.245 --> 01:37:56.413
If you send them out now,

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.290
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:01.459
- I'm assuming we have a Plan D.
- Plan D is Virgil's compartments.

01:38:01.626 --> 01:38:03.461
We put a nuke in
each section of Virgil,

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:06.506
and then eject the individual sections
one at a time. They should stay intact

01:38:06.673 --> 01:38:08.758
- long enough for the nuke to go off.
- [groans]

01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:12.804
- What?
- Virgil's not designed

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.056
to eject undamaged compartments.

01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:19.436
OK, these are the ejection mechanisms
holding each compartment in place, um...

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:23.815
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear, um,

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:25.442
kind of like keys on a key ring.

01:38:25.609 --> 01:38:28.278
What we have to do,
we have to unlock the piston.

01:38:28.445 --> 01:38:31.948
That will release the compartments
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:33.325
Where's the master gear?

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:36.202
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:37.495
Well, what the hell is it doing there?

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:39.164
I built the ship
in three damn months.

01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:41.875
I didn't think I'd be intentionally
sabotaging it. I'm sorry!

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.710
So one of us has to go in there.

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:45.337
- Correct.
- Into the crawl space

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:47.881
- that has core fluid at 9,000 degrees.
- [Braz] Yes.

01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:49.299
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

01:38:49.466 --> 01:38:50.800
[Braz] We don't have
enough at this point.

01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:54.137
9,000 degrees.
And our suits are built to withstand...?

01:38:54.763 --> 01:38:56.765
- Half that, probably.
- Right. Half that.

01:38:56.932 --> 01:38:58.516
So, what you're saying
is whoever goes into that crawl space,

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:00.477
is not coming back.

01:39:10.737 --> 01:39:13.198
- Together.
- Yes, thank you.

01:39:13.365 --> 01:39:14.658
Wait.

01:39:14.824 --> 01:39:15.951
- On three.
- OK.

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:19.371
One... two... three.

01:39:28.922 --> 01:39:30.382
Huh.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:36.054
Well, I better go on, get myself ready.

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.849
No, Braz, wait.
No, Braz. Excuse me.

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:41.059
Just a moment, may I see that?

01:39:41.226 --> 01:39:42.852
- No.
- May I? May I?

01:39:43.019 --> 01:39:45.230
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:49.943
- Magic.
- I mean, Braz,

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.779
three straws of equal length.

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:55.782
I mean, this is childish.
Let's do it again.

01:39:55.949 --> 01:39:59.494
No, we will not do it again. [laughs]
I thought you'd be happy.

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:02.580
No. Not at the expense
of you making us look like fools.

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:04.290
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:06.626
- Because it's my damn ship.
- Oh, that makes perfect sense.

01:40:06.793 --> 01:40:11.006
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but Virgil, 20 years.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:14.175
<i>Virgil</i> belongs to me,
and I will not let her fail.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:19.597
I will not. Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for... this ship.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:22.642
Building it instead of imagining it.

01:40:22.809 --> 01:40:26.187
If <i>Virgil</i> needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

01:40:27.939 --> 01:40:29.858
Now I am going to go and get ready.

01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:42.954
Good to go.

01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:51.629
Beck. Josh.

01:40:54.049 --> 01:40:56.551
It's a hell of a boat you built, Braz.

01:40:56.718 --> 01:41:00.930
I am really proud to
have known you guys.

01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:03.141
[Josh] Thank you.

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:27.332
Braz. Edward.

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:31.211
Yes, Conrad?

01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:34.672
You're right. It is your ship.

01:41:36.508 --> 01:41:38.718
But I wish to God it had been ours.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:56.236
[whooshing]

01:41:56.402 --> 01:41:58.196
[beeping]

01:42:02.408 --> 01:42:04.786
The chamber's sealed, Beck.

01:42:04.953 --> 01:42:06.913
Ready.

01:42:10.208 --> 01:42:12.127
<i>Open the hatch.</i>

01:42:16.089 --> 01:42:17.298
[grunts]

01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:33.481
[Braz grunting]

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:35.441
[screams]

01:42:37.569 --> 01:42:39.112
[sizzling]

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:51.875
Hang on, Braz.

01:42:53.001 --> 01:42:54.085
Come on, hang on.

01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:38.713
[glass shattering]

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:48.431
[computer beeping]

01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:51.017
Manual override is complete!
Braz, we can still get you out of there.

01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:58.483
No... Start... start the impeller.

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:02.946
No.

01:44:10.954 --> 01:44:12.747
[panting]

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:33.810
We got a job to do. Let's do it.

01:44:35.144 --> 01:44:36.396
Let's go.

01:44:38.564 --> 01:44:40.483
[man] Magnetic shielding systems are up.

01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:42.360
- Power level's 85 per cent.
- [computers beeping]

01:44:42.527 --> 01:44:45.822
- Increase power to Reactor ten.
- All personnel should be clear.

01:44:45.989 --> 01:44:47.657
- [typing]
- [computer beeps]

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.587

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:04.382
[Zimsky] Oh, God! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:10.596
- [both grunting]
- OK, she's down.

01:45:11.848 --> 01:45:13.308
<i>[Beck] Approaching the first
drop-off point.</i>

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.310
We got to be accurate
to the second here, boys.

01:45:17.353 --> 01:45:19.772
And drop in three-five seconds.

01:45:19.939 --> 01:45:22.942
And... timer on.

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:24.652
- Pull it.
- [timer beeping]

01:45:29.324 --> 01:45:32.452
Clear... and... ejecting.

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.248
[telephone ringing]

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:42.920
- All right. Initiate firing sequence.
- Sir...

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:45.173
It's our last shot, Stick.

01:45:46.799 --> 01:45:49.719
- Damn you.
- Damn me? Too late.

01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:53.306
<i>[man] Ten, nine, eight...</i>

01:45:54.766 --> 01:45:56.851
[Rat] What's that?

01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:02.231
Gotcha!

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:06.402
- [man 1] ...four, three, two...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:09.989
Someone's diverted our energy.
Where the hell's it gone?!

01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:11.366
It looks like...

01:46:13.451 --> 01:46:15.119
Coney Island.

01:46:17.497 --> 01:46:19.874
Your kung fu is not strong.

01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:22.460
Well, how long will it take
to get it back online?

01:46:23.086 --> 01:46:25.296
Well, then get to it!

01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:36.641
Oh, hey, General.
Is there something I can do for you?

01:46:36.808 --> 01:46:38.684
- Mm.
- [computer game beeping]

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:43.856
- Timer on.
- [timer beeping]

01:46:44.816 --> 01:46:46.484
Clear... ejecting.

01:46:54.033 --> 01:46:55.034
Ejecting.

01:46:58.287 --> 01:47:00.498
Pull it.

01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:01.916
All right.

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:05.545
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.

01:47:05.711 --> 01:47:07.672
I always wanted to make a splash
in nuclear physics.

01:47:07.839 --> 01:47:09.674
You know, that energy propagation stuff
you were talking about...

01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:11.175
- Oh, that was high school physics.
- Yeah, it's not exactly...

01:47:11.342 --> 01:47:13.511
I just took the wavelengths from the
core fluid off the MRI readings.

01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:16.139
- Yeah, and multiplied by 800...
- Six hundred.

01:47:16.973 --> 01:47:21.436
Surely you compensated
for the MRI bias.

01:47:21.602 --> 01:47:22.979
We got to reset the timers!

01:47:24.981 --> 01:47:26.566
[Zimsky] It's not the timers!
No! It just won't work.

01:47:26.732 --> 01:47:28.484
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:30.695
- What's not enough?
- The last bomb is not enough.

01:47:30.862 --> 01:47:32.155
- To complete the wave form.
- Yeah. No.

01:47:32.321 --> 01:47:34.157
The last bomb has
to be 30 per cent larger.

01:47:34.323 --> 01:47:36.200
That's six or seven pounds
of plutonium.

01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:38.286
Where are we going to get six
or seven pounds of plutonium?

01:47:43.082 --> 01:47:44.459
Ahh!

01:47:45.835 --> 01:47:49.714
Guys, we got hit by an energy flare.
I can't keep us on course.

01:47:51.757 --> 01:47:55.261

01:47:55.428 --> 01:47:57.138
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.

01:47:59.265 --> 01:48:01.893
- It's got my shoulder! Ahh!
- Push!

01:48:02.059 --> 01:48:03.978
<i>Guys! Clear!</i>

01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:05.688
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?

01:48:05.855 --> 01:48:07.356
<i>I think the flare
has knocked the come out.</i>

01:48:07.523 --> 01:48:10.151
- I can't get it, Josh. I can't get it.
- Go...

01:48:10.318 --> 01:48:12.904
- I can't.
- OK.

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:17.700
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Can you hear me?

01:48:17.867 --> 01:48:19.952

Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:33.234

to eject this one. Beck!

01:51:37.233 --> 01:51:40.277
- Oh, my God.
- Please.

01:51:40.444 --> 01:51:41.821
[both wincing]

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:44.073
I had to build the blast.

01:51:45.032 --> 01:51:46.951
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on, let me get...

01:51:47.118 --> 01:51:49.662
No. Stay here for one second.

01:51:49.829 --> 01:51:52.123
I was trying to call you.

01:51:52.289 --> 01:51:55.751
- I know. The coms were down.
- Right.

01:51:57.002 --> 01:51:59.714
- I know what you did.
- We don't have enough energy...

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.133
- I know.
- ...to get back.

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:03.634
You did good.

01:52:03.801 --> 01:52:06.303
I would've done the same thing.

You did good.

01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:20.818

[exhales] One minute
to the first detonation.

01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:39.336
And 12 until the blast hits us.

01:52:43.966 --> 01:52:46.761

suffocate to death first.

01:53:23.839 --> 01:53:26.008
Beck, Beck.

01:53:27.218 --> 01:53:30.429
What could you do if I got you enough
power to fire the impeller?

01:53:30.596 --> 01:53:31.931
Maybe not the laser, but the impeller.

01:53:32.097 --> 01:53:35.309
- What? From where?
- The heat of the core.

01:53:35.476 --> 01:53:39.271
It's 9,000 degrees.
Unobtanium converts heat to energy.

01:53:39.438 --> 01:53:42.608
So this whole damn ship
is like a big old solar panel.

01:53:42.775 --> 01:53:44.485
Come on, I need your help.

01:53:51.992 --> 01:53:55.913
- Number two's going!
- Come on, come on.

01:54:12.638 --> 01:54:17.309
For here in the
great infinite unknowable...

01:54:17.476 --> 01:54:21.897

important thing of all:

01:54:22.064 --> 01:54:24.942
Himself.

01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:26.861
He can understand...

01:54:28.779 --> 01:54:31.490
What the fuck am I doing?

01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:34.577
[chuckles]

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.614

01:55:20.456 --> 01:55:22.082
All right!

[cheering continues]

01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:32.384
[Josh] Come on, Beck, where is it?

01:55:34.011 --> 01:55:37.348
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
Is that the last one?

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:39.767
Yeah.

01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:48.275
Give it a couple seconds.

01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:50.569
- [zap]
- [beeping]

01:55:58.535 --> 01:56:00.704
It worked!

Get ready to pull a few G's.

01:56:34.113 --> 01:56:36.782
- Four hundred twenty knots.
- Now, this is more like it.

01:56:36.949 --> 01:56:37.825
Four-forty.

01:56:45.457 --> 01:56:47.835
Mr. Rat, what's the
centre of this quake?

01:56:48.002 --> 01:56:50.337
It's everywhere!
It's one giant shock wave!

01:56:50.504 --> 01:56:52.381
The planet's healing itself.

01:56:55.259 --> 01:56:58.429
At this speed, we're going to be home
in a third of the time.

01:57:30.044 --> 01:57:32.212
As long as we can surf
these magma flows, we'll be OK.

01:57:32.379 --> 01:57:34.673
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.593
or we're going to miss those lasers.

01:57:40.304 --> 01:57:42.973
OK, navigator, which way?

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.558
We've got greater
flow density on the left.

01:57:44.725 --> 01:57:46.310
Go with the flow.

01:58:07.956 --> 01:58:10.542
- [beeping]
- Bill, where are they headed?

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:11.835
Looks like she found
a space between

01:58:12.002 --> 01:58:15.047
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:22.012
- Josh...
- Yeah?

01:58:22.179 --> 01:58:23.263
They're closing in on us too fast.

01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:26.391
- I don't know if I can...
- Beck, you got it.

01:58:37.361 --> 01:58:39.238
[beeping]

01:58:41.573 --> 01:58:43.742
Um... [stammers]

01:58:43.909 --> 01:58:47.162
We lost them, Stick, and I...

01:59:07.933 --> 01:59:09.810
[Beck] Where'd our power go?

01:59:11.228 --> 01:59:13.772
[Josh] We were powered by the heat.

01:59:13.939 --> 01:59:15.607
It's stone cold down here.

01:59:18.152 --> 01:59:19.778
Well...

01:59:19.945 --> 01:59:21.905
Look on the bright side.

01:59:23.657 --> 01:59:25.784
At least we're not
going to boil to death.

01:59:25.951 --> 01:59:28.745
- You always look on the bright side?
- Always.

01:59:30.956 --> 01:59:32.291
OK, let's assess:

01:59:35.294 --> 01:59:39.756
We've got no communications,
we're probably 800 feet down,

01:59:39.923 --> 01:59:41.842
but we might as well be 800 miles.

01:59:42.843 --> 01:59:44.636
We're in an Unobtanium

01:59:44.803 --> 01:59:47.347
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

01:59:47.514 --> 01:59:50.684
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

01:59:50.851 --> 01:59:54.229
but no one's listening
on those frequencies anyway, and...

01:59:55.230 --> 01:59:56.899
...nobody even knows we're alive.

02:00:02.654 --> 02:00:04.823
OK.

02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:07.201
Give me a minute on this one.

02:00:23.967 --> 02:00:25.427
This is hopeless.

02:00:25.594 --> 02:00:27.971
Come on, General, we've got to be
getting close. We can't...

02:00:28.138 --> 02:00:31.808
Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive,
there's no way they could contact us.

02:00:31.975 --> 02:00:33.143

02:00:35.729 --> 02:00:37.814
Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

02:00:37.981 --> 02:00:40.400
- Where do they think?
- Bill, put it up on the hydrophone.

02:00:42.277 --> 02:00:44.321
[whale sounds]

02:00:45.989 --> 02:00:46.990
Whales, sir.

02:00:47.157 --> 02:00:50.577
They're a long way off their usual path,
but that's not uncommon since that...

02:00:50.744 --> 02:00:52.829
What are they calling it?
Orbital wobble?

02:00:52.996 --> 02:00:55.207
Yeah, that's what they call it.

02:00:55.374 --> 02:00:59.461
Well, thank you very much, Captain,
but I think we're done here.

02:00:59.628 --> 02:01:01.004
General.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:08.011
J.O., this is the captain.
Stand down from SAR Operations.

02:01:39.543 --> 02:01:42.379
It's whales! It's whales!

02:01:42.546 --> 02:01:46.383
Hey! General! Stick!

02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:49.428
It's whales! The ultrasonics!

02:01:49.594 --> 02:01:53.307
They're singing to them!
You gotta find the whales!

02:02:11.616 --> 02:02:14.161
[man] Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

02:02:14.328 --> 02:02:17.831
I'm changing...
Hold on, I'm seeing those whales now.

02:02:17.998 --> 02:02:20.834
Whoa! OK, ball's in the water.

02:02:21.001 --> 02:02:23.628
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

02:02:23.795 --> 02:02:26.256
Hold on, hold on.
We have a strong echo here.

02:02:26.423 --> 02:02:28.925
Depth, 800 feet.
There's something down there.

02:02:29.092 --> 02:02:31.011
There's definitely
something down there.

02:03:14.638 --> 02:03:17.140
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

02:03:17.307 --> 02:03:19.518
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

02:03:20.519 --> 02:03:22.229
Yes.

02:03:22.979 --> 02:03:25.148
So, what's next for you?

02:03:25.816 --> 02:03:28.235
- A shower.
- [laughs]

02:03:28.985 --> 02:03:32.155
Then back to NASA, I guess.

02:03:32.322 --> 02:03:33.782
You?

02:03:33.949 --> 02:03:37.494
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

02:03:37.661 --> 02:03:40.205
- extra mushrooms, then a shower...
- Mmm.

02:03:40.372 --> 02:03:42.874
...and then back to the classroom.

02:03:43.792 --> 02:03:46.169
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

02:03:48.839 --> 02:03:53.427
Yeah. Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

02:03:58.348 --> 02:04:02.144
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:05.814
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

02:04:05.981 --> 02:04:08.984
No one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

02:04:12.112 --> 02:04:16.450
Unless... it all got out somehow.

02:04:19.536 --> 02:04:23.665
- That's unthinkable.
- Yeah.

02:04:27.919 --> 02:04:29.921
[chattering]

02:04:58.617 --> 02:05:01.620
[cracks knuckles] OK, here we go.

02:05:02.370 --> 02:05:04.706
[beeping]

02:05:04.873 --> 02:05:07.125
- [all computers beeping]
- [people murmuring]

02:05:10.795 --> 02:05:12.839
Sweet.

02:05:25.435 --> 02:05:28.438
<i>[woman] It is now emerging that
the world owes its survival</i>

02:05:28.605 --> 02:05:31.733
<i>to the heroism of six
remarkable individuals:</i>

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:33.777
<i>- Shuttle Commander Robert Iverson...
- [man 1] This extraordinary craft...</i>

02:05:33.944 --> 02:05:35.278
<i>[woman] ...French Scientist,
Dr. Serge...</i>

02:05:35.445 --> 02:05:37.948
<i>[man 1] ...was captained
by NASA astronaut Dr. Bob Iverson.</i>

02:05:38.114 --> 02:05:39.533
<i>[man 2] Edward Brazzelton is a name...</i>

02:05:39.699 --> 02:05:42.285
<i>[man 3] ...Dr. Conrad Zimsky
will be best remembered...</i>

02:05:42.452 --> 02:05:45.455
<i>[man 4] On Capitol Hill today,
everyone's asking the same question:</i>

02:05:45.622 --> 02:05:48.166
<i>What is Project Destiny?</i>

02:05:48.333 --> 02:05:50.961
<i>[reporters overlapping]</i>

02:05:51.127 --> 02:05:53.338
Destiny, meet world.

02:05:53.505 --> 02:05:56.007
World, meet Destiny.

02:05:57.133 --> 02:06:00.220
<i>[man] Dr. Brazzelton, Dr. Zimsky...</i>

02:06:00.387 --> 02:06:03.056
<i>[reporters fade]</i>
