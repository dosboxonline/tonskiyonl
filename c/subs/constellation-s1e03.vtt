WEBVTT

00:15.599 --> 00:18.101
Mummy, where are we going?

00:18.769 --> 00:21.063
There's another cabin over the lake.
Come on.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.402
Honey, what are you doing?
We gotta keep moving.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.739
I'm making a trail like Hansel and Gretel.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.535
You remember?
You used to read me <i>Hansel and Gretel</i>.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.953
There's another cabin.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.038
It's like our cabin,
but it's not our cabin.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.414
We're not gonna get lost. Come.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.713
Mummy?

00:47.714 --> 00:48.715
Mummy!

00:53.178 --> 00:54.179
Mummy!

01:25.294 --> 01:27.379
<i>She doesn't look too much like herself.</i>

01:27.379 --> 01:29.047
She's still your mum.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.259
She looks like she's dead.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.146
Hey, Alice.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.397
What if she doesn't come out?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.066
I'd like to take a moment

02:29.942 --> 02:35.948
and remember our colleague and friend
Commander Paul Lancaster.

02:35.948 --> 02:41.870
He was the most amazing,
funny, dedicated, smart person,

02:41.870 --> 02:45.707
a loving husband and father,
a great leader.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.585
And no words can describe
how much we miss him.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.129
Your questions, please.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.716
What do you personally think
caused the accident?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.385
It was a collision.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.345
Yes, but with what?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.180
Probably something very small.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.475
There are systems
on board the ISS that scan for debris.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.269
There was an alarm.
We just didn't have time--

03:05.269 --> 03:06.770
We're in the middle
of a joint investigation

03:06.770 --> 03:08.897
and we don't wanna anticipate the inquiry.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.858
- Sorry for interrupting you, Jo.
- It's okay.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.401
Is your mission over?

03:12.401 --> 03:14.444
Do you get to spend some time
with your family?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.030
We-- No, my mission is not over.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.866
I have nine months of...

03:20.742 --> 03:24.371
experiments and data collections that I--

03:25.831 --> 03:28.041
My specific mission has been to monitor

03:28.041 --> 03:31.920
the physical and neurological effects
of long-term space travel and...

03:33.046 --> 03:35.215
And are you feeling
those effects currently?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.261
Well, I feel...

03:41.471 --> 03:44.725
I feel a lot better than I did
a couple of days ago.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.729
But you know...

03:51.398 --> 03:54.109
you forget how Earth smells.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.821
There is no weather in space.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.199
There's no seasons.

04:01.658 --> 04:06.163
So it's really nice
to feel the autumn and to smell the rain.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.291
I'm very happy to be back home.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.048
Are you guys okay?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.091
Great.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.638
Look, there are three of us again.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.691
- Where will they bury him?
- I don't know, honey.

04:36.151 --> 04:36.985
Arlington?

04:36.985 --> 04:42.699
That's where they bury people like
Neil Armstrong, President John Kennedy.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.409
People from the olden days?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.411
People who come from America

04:46.411 --> 04:49.164
who have done something really brave
and important.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.627
Heroes like your daddy.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.215
Erica,

04:59.842 --> 05:02.386
he was a great man. I'm so sorry.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.681
Frida is my name.

05:15.566 --> 05:18.694
We brought the machine learning stuff,
the stuff we could carry.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.153
It's not ideal, but--

05:20.153 --> 05:21.488
Doesn't matter.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.573
Look.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.912
This is what we got...

05:31.206 --> 05:32.541
just before the collision.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.420
There's an interference effect.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.634
I got the same thing when I extracted
the data down here at Baikonur.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.094
- What?
- The exact same.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.180
How? It can only run in space.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.807
- Okay, show me.
- I didn't record it.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.394
I mean, it faded away,
but it was there. I saw it.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.646
I know it was there on the ISS,

05:55.189 --> 05:57.149
but it can't possibly
have survived on Earth.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.610
- It's impossible.
- Well, exactly, Eryn.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.863
And that's why we'll run it again
with all this.

06:41.151 --> 06:45.113
<i>Welcome to Berni-Con IV.</i>

06:50.786 --> 06:53.497
Hey, Bud. Bud?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.332
- Hey.
- What's your per diem?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.459
Not e-fucking-nough.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.463
Ten days on a ship,
talking to fucking lunatics.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.633
And look at this guy.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.806
I walked on the fucking moon,
and this is how the journey ends.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.309
Making me sit and debate that asshole.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.978
- Hi.
- Can I get you a glass of water?

07:15.978 --> 07:18.397
I got 250. Twenty bucks per autograph.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.440
And in the middle of a space tragedy.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.943
I tell you, it's bad taste.
It's bad timing.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.779
And all the supposed bullshit
that happened with me

07:25.779 --> 07:26.989
and those other guys--

07:28.240 --> 07:29.324
Damn it.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.703
The convention circuit's
much better than acting.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.955
Lot more sex in it, for a start.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.415
I'm sick of hearing it.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.375
This is the way it is now.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.752
I am sick of the status quo.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.337
Things are gonna change.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.508
- Hi.
- Here come the aliens.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.052
- Can you sign this to Sophie Space...
- Yeah.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.522
We have to whisper.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.191
<i>Why is that?</i>

08:02.691 --> 08:05.235
'Cause they're doing
something very fiddly at the CAL.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.906
- Hey, Alice.
- <i>Hi, Paul.</i>

08:09.823 --> 08:11.241
<i>Your mama's big day today.</i>

08:12.284 --> 08:14.286
<i>RPL. CAL data:</i>

08:14.286 --> 08:20.292
<i>Core signals green, magnets aligned, 25.5.</i>

08:20.292 --> 08:22.211
- <i>Copy, phase six.</i>
- <i>Copy.</i>

08:22.211 --> 08:24.963
- <i>Core temperature.</i>
- <i>I miss you so much.</i>

08:24.963 --> 08:28.133
<i>I miss you too, Mummy.
Will you be careful when you go out there?</i>

08:28.133 --> 08:29.343
<i>Always.</i>

08:40.229 --> 08:44.566
I find it strange
that there isn't an MMOD alarm,

08:45.567 --> 08:47.694
'cause I remember hearing it
quite clearly.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.823
That's important to know,
if the collision was signaled.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.159
What about your colleagues?

08:58.914 --> 09:00.249
I don't recall it.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.962
There wasn't an MMOD data report.
There was no alarm. I checked.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.843
I was asleep.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.803
So there was no alarm.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.388
NASA's responsibility.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.849
And NASA's financial liability.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.616
What's that sound? I've heard that sound.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.535
Not just once, but several times.

09:36.535 --> 09:37.536
Static.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.997
<i>All comms are open.</i>

09:39.997 --> 09:44.793
<i>Crew gather in Soyuz 1 evacuation capsule.
Initiate pre-evacuation protocols.</i>

09:44.793 --> 09:46.545
<i>Fire and fog in Zarya.</i>

09:46.545 --> 09:48.380
- <i>Power down.</i>
- <i>Houston,</i>

09:48.380 --> 09:50.716
<i>there's a fire between us and Soyuz 1.</i>

09:50.716 --> 09:53.010
<i>Let's gather in Rassvet instead.</i>

09:53.010 --> 09:54.761
- <i>Ericsson.</i>
- <i>Andreev.</i>

09:54.761 --> 09:56.555
- <i>Brostin.</i>
- <i>Suri.</i>

09:56.555 --> 09:58.724
- <i>I'm stuck.</i>
- <i>Ericsson, Brostin,</i>

09:58.724 --> 10:00.100
<i>air is clear.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:02.436
The collision object was shown
as an obstruction

10:02.436 --> 10:04.605
on the electrical node on the trusses.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.899
It isn't a known piece of orbital debris.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.484
Bring up the footage of the space walk.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.655
<i>Jo, medical team is working on Paul.
Continue with EVA.</i>

10:13.655 --> 10:17.993
<i>Copy. Keep me posted.
Where am I heading now?</i>

10:17.993 --> 10:19.620
<i>Tell her to head to the truss.</i>

10:19.620 --> 10:22.581
<i>It's critical they fix
secondary life support systems.</i>

10:24.917 --> 10:27.961
<i>Jo, we can't see what you see.
Check camera.</i>

10:27.961 --> 10:32.216
<i>Understood. I got a red light.
It's a fault. Sorry.</i>

10:32.925 --> 10:34.092
We lost video here.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.428
We don't have a full transcript
of what went on next.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.014
NASA/ESA are responsible
for the exterior cameras.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.058
There was collision damage.

10:41.058 --> 10:45.229
So there can be no conclusion
about the collision object.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.731
It was a body.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.566
A human body.

10:53.028 --> 10:58.825
It was the body of a woman
wearing a USSR flight suit and helmet.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.746
The body inside was desiccated,

11:03.747 --> 11:04.748
mummified.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.418
I reached out to touch it.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.880
It came free and continued its orbit.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.760
Commander,

11:17.803 --> 11:23.308
you realize how unlikely it is
that a body has been preserved in space

11:23.308 --> 11:27.688
for at least 32 years,
at least since the fall of the USSR?

11:28.522 --> 11:32.401
And that such an object
could have impacted ISS?

11:32.401 --> 11:33.485
Yes.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.612
Obviously, I do realize--

11:35.612 --> 11:38.866
We have a note here
in our recovered transcripts.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.411
"06:55:48. Ericsson.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.831
'Can you check oxygen mix?'"

11:46.623 --> 11:49.168
What was your reason for asking
for the oxygen check?

11:51.044 --> 11:54.006
There was no issue with the oxygen mix
in my EVA suit.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.424
The test shows that I--

11:55.424 --> 11:57.259
That was not my question.

11:58.969 --> 12:02.306
What was your reason for asking
for the oxygen check?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.232
I was concerned that I was...

12:13.984 --> 12:14.985
hypoxic.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.113
That you were getting insufficient oxygen
to your brain?

12:18.864 --> 12:20.407
- Yes.
- Because?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.660
Because just like you,

12:24.286 --> 12:27.080
I found it hard to believe
what I was seeing.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.920
No cosmonaut or astronaut
has ever been reported dead or missing

12:32.920 --> 12:34.129
above the Kármán line.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.214
Isn't that true?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.884
- Yes.
- So what's your explanation?

12:39.635 --> 12:42.012
I think we should start
to look at space debris.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.681
Did you ever have any other
such instances?

12:45.724 --> 12:46.725
I beg your pardon?

12:47.267 --> 12:51.396
Did you feel
that you were experiencing hypoxia,

12:51.396 --> 12:52.940
symptoms of lack of oxygen,

12:52.940 --> 12:57.361
at any other point in your mission,
before or after?

13:00.739 --> 13:03.116
Symptoms of hypoxia include memory loss...

13:05.536 --> 13:06.537
confusion...

13:08.205 --> 13:09.456
hallucinations.

13:16.797 --> 13:17.798
No.

13:18.674 --> 13:19.675
I didn't.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.394
Watch your step down here.

14:16.106 --> 14:20.611
You are to take one
of these pills daily until further notice.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.197
What is it?

14:23.947 --> 14:28.202
Folic acid, vitamins D and B-12.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.340
There's no condensate, only the residue.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.549
It was there.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.387
Henry, come on. It can't have lived
more than a millionth of a second.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.097
"Henry, come on"?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.266
What, do you think I'm seeing a ghost?

14:51.266 --> 14:53.644
Don't speak to me like I'm stupid.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.646
And don't speak to me like I'm your PA.

14:55.646 --> 15:00.192
And how do you explain the fact that
when I extracted the data yesterday,

15:00.192 --> 15:04.488
it was the same image that we saw
when the experiment ran on the ISS?

15:04.488 --> 15:05.822
It's a glitch.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.076
- This is Russian machinery.
- All right. Enough of this.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.746
Apologies for being short with you, Eryn.

15:12.746 --> 15:16.250
But it was damn well there,
even if it isn't now.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.335
There's an interference effect.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.171
There's a connection,
and we need to know what that is.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.513
I like your hair like that.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.560
I don't give a lot of consideration
to my hair.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.772
The older you get, the better you look.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.280
Well, dagnabbit.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.201
I think I just got a compliment.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.496
I've missed you.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.376
I missed you too, Jo.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.593
It kind of felt like I was drowning...

16:09.678 --> 16:10.679
you know?

16:11.930 --> 16:12.931
Uh-huh.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.477
I'm sorry I put you through that--

16:17.477 --> 16:18.979
No, no, no, no.

16:20.397 --> 16:23.233
That's what we shook hands on. Right?

16:34.995 --> 16:36.246
Wine.

16:37.456 --> 16:38.582
I forgot the wine.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.628
Daddy?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.174
How about Mummy?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.511
Mummy's home. Don't know if you heard.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.311
Has she forgotten all her Swedish?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.146
Daddy?

17:07.903 --> 17:09.154
What's up, honey?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.682
<i>One year before Apollo 11,</i>

17:36.682 --> 17:40.227
there were over 10,000 recorded faults
in the command capsule,

17:40.227 --> 17:44.898
including 500 critical reports
in the life support systems.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.526
The Apollo 9 fire
was caused by one of these.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.986
Three people died.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.904
There was no time to fix these problems

17:50.904 --> 17:53.907
before Armstrong,
Aldrin and Collins set off.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.869
Except, as you've said,
there was one year.

17:57.369 --> 18:01.331
Now, do you think NASA spent that
whole year scratching their hemorrhoids?

18:01.331 --> 18:03.834
You know, I do wanna say,

18:03.834 --> 18:06.128
we just lost someone up there,

18:07.004 --> 18:08.130
an astronaut.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.176
That is a real person with a real family--

18:12.176 --> 18:15.387
- Point four, the Van Allen radiation belt.
- There's a basic standard

18:15.387 --> 18:19.600
of human respect, sir. We just lost
the whole International Space Station--

18:19.600 --> 18:22.019
With the levels of radiation
between the Earth and the moon,

18:22.019 --> 18:24.897
and the relative thinness
of the command module,

18:24.897 --> 18:27.733
the astronauts would have had
serious radiation sickness.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.818
You would have all died
of leukemia by now.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.904
When you leave the Earth's atmosphere,

18:31.904 --> 18:34.740
your exit velocity is
about 10,000 miles an hour.

18:34.740 --> 18:37.534
You pass through the Van Allen belt
in a blink of an eye.

18:37.534 --> 18:41.872
There's no time for radioactive particles
to interact with the body.

18:41.872 --> 18:44.917
There. I engaged.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.544
I shouldn't have engaged, but I engaged.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.506
What I should have done
is thrown you in the goddamn sea.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.592
Let me ask you something.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.344
You think we're up there,

18:57.012 --> 18:59.556
or do you think we're just playacting, huh?

19:00.516 --> 19:02.017
How about you, sir?

19:02.017 --> 19:04.478
You think the ISS is a fairy story?

19:05.062 --> 19:07.064
Nope. I believe it exists.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.361
You know, I wasn't on Apollo 11,
so I don't know if they went to the moon.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.363
But I was on Apollo 18,

19:15.155 --> 19:17.074
and I know I sure as hell did.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.451
Yeah. I read your book.

19:19.451 --> 19:22.788
There you go, kids.
Book available at the door.

19:22.788 --> 19:25.582
It's so full of inaccuracies
as to be completely worthless.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.750
Excuse me?

19:26.750 --> 19:29.461
It's full of things
that are factually incorrect.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.547
You don't even get the name
of your first dog right.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.466
- I mean, who wrote it?
- Me.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.179
You don't think I know
the name of my first dog?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.598
I don't know.
You don't get things right, sir.

19:41.598 --> 19:46.019
I think you've been fed a story.
Or you have a very unreliable memory.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.940
I would be very careful
before you call me a liar.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.820
I think perhaps you did get to the moon.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.282
I think maybe by then,
they'd solved some issues.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.450
But there was a near disaster
on Apollo 13.

20:00.450 --> 20:04.454
And on your mission six years later,
two men died.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.125
I think you're telling a story

20:08.125 --> 20:11.503
or you've been fed a story
that does not make sense.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.367
Hello, baby!

20:47.998 --> 20:48.999
Christ.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.212
Come on. Jesus Christ!

21:04.181 --> 21:05.098
No!

21:05.098 --> 21:06.683
Where the hell are you going?

21:23.992 --> 21:24.910
<i>You okay?</i>

21:25.953 --> 21:27.996
Don't know. A bit weird.

21:28.539 --> 21:29.998
You wanna talk about it?

21:31.083 --> 21:32.918
- It's okay.
- Are you sure?

21:34.044 --> 21:35.337
Yeah, sure.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.922
My legs are so swollen.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.090
When you're up in space,

21:38.090 --> 21:40.133
all your fluids kind of races up
to your head.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.760
And now they splash down.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.512
I've got you.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.013
You sure?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.349
Okay. You gotta hold tightly, okay?

21:47.349 --> 21:48.767
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.399
- You okay?
- Yeah. Careful. I'm good.

21:55.399 --> 21:58.193
I think you need to go and get Daddy.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.736
I'm sorry.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.447
- You'll be okay?
- I'm okay. Just get Daddy, okay?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.824
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.560
Hello?

22:46.909 --> 22:47.910
Alice?

22:51.538 --> 22:53.207
Here.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.543
You all right? You fell. Yep, I got you.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.046
That's it.

23:02.925 --> 23:04.760
I'm okay. It's okay.

23:06.595 --> 23:07.596
It's okay.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.103
<i>A glove lost by Ed White
on the first American EVA.</i>

23:15.604 --> 23:18.649
<i>A camera lost by Michael Collins
near Gemini 10.</i>

23:19.149 --> 23:22.402
A thermal blanket lost during STS-88.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.696
And these garbage bags

23:25.948 --> 23:30.118
jettisoned by astronauts from Skylab
over the period of '73/'74.

23:30.994 --> 23:33.205
I think garbage bag is a good candidate.

23:34.915 --> 23:38.043
You think it was a garbage bag
that caused the accident?

23:41.505 --> 23:43.924
No, I don't think it was a garbage bag.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.178
The size and shape of a garbage bag?

23:48.971 --> 23:52.224
If I would have seen a garbage bag,
I would have said it was a garbage bag,

23:52.224 --> 23:53.392
for Christ's sake!

23:53.392 --> 23:55.269
Please moderate your tone, Commander.

23:55.769 --> 23:58.188
It's not anybody's job here
to take your word for it.

23:59.398 --> 24:04.862
...eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15,

24:04.862 --> 24:10.325
16, 17, 18, 19, 20!

24:10.993 --> 24:12.870
Coming, ready or not!

24:15.789 --> 24:19.251
We're not replicating it,
however much we might want to.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.253
Replicating?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.175
I replicated this.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.052
It's a drawing, Henry.

24:30.721 --> 24:33.223
You don't win a Nobel Prize
with just a drawing.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.725
Oh, Eryn, I know.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.727
I already won a Nobel Prize.

24:39.438 --> 24:41.481
Yeah. In, like, 1981.

24:50.324 --> 24:51.783
Can't you just help me out?

24:53.327 --> 24:57.122
Damn thing's been my life's work
for the last 35 years.

24:57.122 --> 25:00.209
Well, why do you see it and I don't?

25:01.210 --> 25:03.003
The goddamn observer effect.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.506
It's the only explanation I can think of...

25:11.428 --> 25:13.138
short of me seeing things.

25:39.998 --> 25:40.999
Hey!

25:43.627 --> 25:44.670
Hey!

26:07.025 --> 26:07.860
Found!

26:10.779 --> 26:13.365
What did you do to my rabbit?
That's my rabbit.

26:13.365 --> 26:16.118
- I didn't do anything to your rabbit.
- Why are you being horrible?

26:16.118 --> 26:18.370
You can't be evil
to somebody else's rabbit.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.914
- I've got your stupid rabbit.
- But why did you do it?

26:20.914 --> 26:23.041
You can't just do anything
just because your dad's dead.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.711
It should've been your mama.

26:25.711 --> 26:27.504
Your mom's a crazy bitch.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.339
That's what my mom said.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.799
Your mum's a bitch too.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.857
We just take a look at this slide.

26:46.857 --> 26:51.778
This is a garbage bag jettisoned
from Mir by Soviet cosmonauts.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.992
NASA estimates about 350 of these are--

26:59.369 --> 27:04.666
Commander, nobody has anything
but respect for you and for what you did.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.794
But the entire history
of the Soviet space program

27:07.794 --> 27:09.296
has been declassified,

27:09.296 --> 27:13.842
and there are dozens of memoirs
of cosmonauts, engineers, controllers

27:13.842 --> 27:17.346
who have gone on the record
even after the fall of the USSR.

27:17.346 --> 27:22.309
We know who was on the cosmonaut teams,
who flew, who didn't fly, when they flew.

27:22.309 --> 27:25.812
There isn't a single unaccounted-for man
or woman in any of them.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.485
You saw something that was not there.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.571
You were under enormous stress.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.366
It happens.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.743
Let's adjourn for today.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.997
Come on. Let's go talk in my office.

27:46.583 --> 27:47.584
Henry.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.893
Look, I'm sticking my neck out for you.

28:05.644 --> 28:07.646
It's not gonna be good for us
if this whole thing devolves

28:07.646 --> 28:10.107
on whether you were getting
enough oxygen to your brain.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.527
They're gonna keep on trying
to make you look unreliable,

28:13.527 --> 28:15.279
because they don't wanna admit
the possibility

28:15.279 --> 28:17.948
that any of their debris is responsible
for the collision.

28:17.948 --> 28:19.783
I saw what I fucking saw.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.459
Are you taking your vitamins?

28:32.087 --> 28:33.297
What are you doing?

28:38.093 --> 28:40.470
I don't know what the fuck is the matter
with you, Jo.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.014
Just sort out your story.

29:11.502 --> 29:12.503
Magnus!

29:13.629 --> 29:15.797
Magnus!

29:18.217 --> 29:19.301
I've got you.

29:19.968 --> 29:23.305
I don't know what's going on.
I don't feel like myself anymore.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.099
Okay. All right,
let's just get you inside.

29:28.894 --> 29:29.937
- Wha--
- Here. Sit down.

29:29.937 --> 29:32.481
It just feels like
they're attacking me all the time.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.149
Okay.

29:35.901 --> 29:37.444
- I just wanna go home.
- Okay.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.529
I know.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.614
Let's just take this really easy.

29:40.614 --> 29:41.865
Okay?

29:41.865 --> 29:43.450
You wanna take your shoes off?

29:43.450 --> 29:44.701
Okay.

29:46.119 --> 29:49.831
There you go. Okay? That's one.

29:50.666 --> 29:51.750
I love you.

29:55.504 --> 29:56.588
I love you too.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.301
Would you stand up?

30:01.301 --> 30:03.136
Just-- There we go.

30:05.389 --> 30:08.058
Okay. You okay there?

30:09.977 --> 30:12.855
Lift that arm. There we go.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.518
There you are.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.563
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:56.523 --> 30:57.900
How are you, Alice?

30:58.525 --> 30:59.526
I don't know.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.696
Anything on your mind?

31:04.656 --> 31:05.866
Did you go to the moon?

31:06.992 --> 31:09.912
Once. 1977.

31:11.830 --> 31:12.831
What was it like?

31:16.877 --> 31:17.878
Pretty good.

31:20.756 --> 31:22.090
What are you doing here?

31:26.762 --> 31:27.763
Science stuff.

31:28.472 --> 31:29.473
Like what?

31:30.349 --> 31:32.017
Have you ever heard of quantum physics?

31:32.518 --> 31:35.479
Yes. I don't know what they are.

31:35.479 --> 31:37.773
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

31:38.524 --> 31:41.610
For a long time,
the way that we understood the world

31:41.610 --> 31:44.905
was governed by
what is called classical physics.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.990
- You know what that is?
- Kind of.

31:47.491 --> 31:50.911
It is a basic way
of measuring and predicting things.

31:52.412 --> 31:56.041
Then along came people,
people like Albert Einstein.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.751
- Have you heard of him?
- Yeah.

31:57.751 --> 32:00.587
Yeah. He started
to look into really small things

32:00.587 --> 32:03.882
like atoms, subatomic particles, waveforms.

32:04.883 --> 32:08.720
And it began to look like
classical physics didn't apply anymore,

32:08.720 --> 32:10.180
which is mysterious.

32:11.014 --> 32:13.809
It's not predictable
in ways we currently understand.

32:13.809 --> 32:19.690
For example, the same thing can be
in two different states at the same time.

32:19.690 --> 32:24.278
You could have a particle, for instance,
the exact same particle.

32:24.778 --> 32:27.030
There's a world
in which that particle is black

32:27.030 --> 32:30.284
and a world
in which that particle is white.

32:31.076 --> 32:35.163
And there's a kind of point
of liminal space between those worlds,

32:35.163 --> 32:39.877
where the particle is black and white
at the same time.

32:40.377 --> 32:43.380
And they don't seem to want to decide
which state they'll be

32:44.965 --> 32:46.842
until someone looks at them.

32:49.970 --> 32:51.138
That's nuts.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.265
Well, that's nuts.

32:55.392 --> 32:56.810
But it's real.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.607
I invented a machine
that we took up into space

33:02.524 --> 33:05.694
- and I was hoping to get some answers to--
- Did it work?

33:07.988 --> 33:08.989
I don't know.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.368
I kind of think I saw something...

33:15.662 --> 33:17.915
but it seems
like it doesn't want to be seen.

33:20.459 --> 33:21.543
Like hide-and-seek.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.506
Just like hide-and-seek.

33:39.478 --> 33:40.479
<i>Alice.</i>

33:44.733 --> 33:45.817
<i>I'm sorry I--</i>

33:47.361 --> 33:48.654
<i>I left you alone.</i>

33:50.531 --> 33:52.199
Do I seem the same to you?

33:55.244 --> 33:56.703
Not entirely.

34:00.749 --> 34:01.750
Why?

34:03.710 --> 34:05.420
You look at me a bit differently.

34:07.714 --> 34:08.799
How do I look at you?

34:11.134 --> 34:12.386
As though you like me.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.014
Okay.

34:23.313 --> 34:25.858
- I brought you something home.
- Hello.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.027
And I'd like to thank you
for bringing my baby home.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.156
The CAL wasn't an ESA experiment.

34:33.156 --> 34:35.534
You didn't need to help. I appreciate it.

34:36.618 --> 34:38.954
- Jo Ericsson.
- Henry Caldera.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.333
We've met.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
Yeah.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.884
You're the-- Apollo program.

34:51.884 --> 34:52.967
Man and boy.

34:54.719 --> 34:58.098
The CAL, this experiment,
it's a-- it's important?

34:58.682 --> 34:59.683
It is to me.

35:00.726 --> 35:04.938
Listen, there are big bureaucracies
at play here, Commander.

35:04.938 --> 35:08.442
They all have their agendas.
Not just the Russians, everybody.

35:08.984 --> 35:11.570
It's easy to get ground up in the gears.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.781
Those people
who have actually been up there,

35:15.949 --> 35:18.285
they need to watch out for themselves.

35:22.039 --> 35:23.457
If you ever want to talk...

35:23.457 --> 35:24.541
Thank you.

35:40.641 --> 35:43.393
- I thought you were at Wendy's.
- We had a fight.

35:44.019 --> 35:46.355
- About what?
- She said her mum--

35:47.022 --> 35:48.732
She said her mum thinks you're crazy.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.202
I found the flight suit
that I think it was.

36:02.538 --> 36:03.664
The one that I saw.

36:04.998 --> 36:05.999
That hit us.

36:07.209 --> 36:08.210
Look, it...

36:11.880 --> 36:14.967
It's an early-'60s Star City life suit.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.761
Salyut 7 and onwards.

36:18.345 --> 36:19.513
You know who that is?

36:20.681 --> 36:21.515
Who?

36:23.183 --> 36:24.184
Irena.

36:28.647 --> 36:30.274
Well, I'm not saying it was her.

36:32.317 --> 36:35.112
But if it was a failed Soviet mission,

36:35.112 --> 36:36.655
they would've covered it up.

36:37.865 --> 36:42.578
You know, I heard from a guy
that Gagarin was not first in space.

36:42.578 --> 36:46.373
It was-- No, really.
It was Vladimir Ilyushin.

36:46.373 --> 36:47.541
But he crashed in China,

36:47.541 --> 36:51.712
so they brought him back home
and locked him up.

36:51.712 --> 36:55.883
That's a conspiracy theory.
We can't start on conspiracy theories.

36:55.883 --> 36:58.927
Guys, this is not a conspiracy theory.
This is what I saw.

37:00.304 --> 37:02.723
What's the least reliable form
of evidence?

37:03.223 --> 37:04.558
Audrey.

37:04.558 --> 37:08.312
What is the least reliable form
of evidence, Jo?

37:09.605 --> 37:11.106
Eyewitness testimony.

37:11.106 --> 37:13.025
You're a scientist. You know this.

37:13.984 --> 37:14.985
Guys, it's here.

37:20.574 --> 37:22.159
Looks like it's dead.

37:23.202 --> 37:24.912
It'll be okay in the spring.

37:25.913 --> 37:26.914
Here.

37:52.981 --> 37:54.816
Could I get a moment alone, please?

37:55.651 --> 37:56.818
Sure.

37:57.444 --> 37:58.362
Yeah.

38:27.099 --> 38:29.226
Somewhere in space hangs my heart.

38:32.104 --> 38:33.856
From it stream sparks...

38:36.024 --> 38:37.568
into other intemperate hearts.

38:51.164 --> 38:55.544
There you have one
of the Mir garbage bags for medical waste,

38:55.544 --> 38:57.588
which they were using in the 1980s.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.716
There are several hundred
of them still in orbit.

39:03.427 --> 39:06.889
To be fair, it's a very close match.
We can accept this.

39:06.889 --> 39:09.892
USSR debris, not our financial liability.

39:09.892 --> 39:13.645
You have to consider the extreme trauma
you were all experiencing.

39:13.645 --> 39:14.730
Fine.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.026
Repeat that.

39:24.656 --> 39:25.657
Fine.

39:27.826 --> 39:30.454
You withdraw your claim
that you saw a space suit?

39:33.832 --> 39:34.833
Yes.

39:40.005 --> 39:42.966
We're very happy that we have consensus.

39:43.675 --> 39:46.303
Great, Jo. Good job.

39:50.849 --> 39:51.975
Can we go home?

40:52.619 --> 40:54.246
Did we get a new car?

40:55.080 --> 40:55.914
What?

41:01.837 --> 41:03.338
What did you do that for?

41:05.007 --> 41:06.008
I thought it'd float.

41:06.008 --> 41:08.927
You literally just dropped that
on the floor like a complete doofus.

41:08.927 --> 41:11.138
Alice, do you wanna take
your bag upstairs?

41:16.435 --> 41:18.478
- You all right?
- Yeah.

41:20.731 --> 41:22.065
We got a new car?

41:23.150 --> 41:25.110
- What?
- It's blue.

41:26.570 --> 41:27.571
It is.

41:28.906 --> 41:30.115
Bu-- It's not red...

41:33.368 --> 41:35.245
I'm pretty sure we had a red car.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.291
No, it's blue.

42:30.592 --> 42:32.261
When's the last time we do this?

42:35.222 --> 42:37.516
It makes me feel obscurely better.

42:38.016 --> 42:39.226
As you said.

42:40.644 --> 42:42.563
You dreaming of the Earth or of space?

42:43.188 --> 42:46.441
I am always dreaming of space.

42:47.693 --> 42:51.196
I'm dreaming
of endlessly circling the Earth.

42:53.156 --> 42:54.658
You wonder why that's the case?

42:56.451 --> 42:57.911
You're covering, Irena.

42:59.121 --> 43:02.249
Why is it such an issue
that there wasn't a dead cosmonaut?

43:05.544 --> 43:08.839
Because there was no dead cosmonaut.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.132
Maybe there was.

43:15.304 --> 43:16.597
I'm dying...

43:19.975 --> 43:23.437
I have lymphoma. Stage four.

43:27.024 --> 43:31.361
So this is the last time.

43:38.202 --> 43:39.995
Are you really dying, Valya?

43:41.121 --> 43:44.249
Music. You choose.

44:18.909 --> 44:21.286
You feel obscurely worse?

44:21.286 --> 44:22.371
Seriously?

44:23.455 --> 44:26.416
- Since the accident?
- Of course I feel worse.

44:28.252 --> 44:30.254
I don't know what's going to happen to me.

44:31.296 --> 44:36.051
I'm worried there won't be any heaven
or there won't be any hell.

44:55.821 --> 44:57.281
So what was the deal?

44:59.575 --> 45:00.868
Excuse me.

45:01.952 --> 45:03.662
- You wanna join us?
- No.

45:03.662 --> 45:06.039
I need you to come take a walk with me.

45:22.472 --> 45:24.266
None of
the other return flights had landed

45:24.266 --> 45:26.685
within a thousand miles
of their intended site,

45:27.477 --> 45:29.479
yet you managed
to land an unpiloted module

45:29.479 --> 45:33.275
within 500 yards of where the USS
<i>Franklin Roosevelt</i> was waiting for it.

45:33.275 --> 45:36.028
Yeah, me and two dead bodies.

45:36.028 --> 45:38.363
Let me ask you,
do you think I killed those guys?

45:38.363 --> 45:41.158
Is this part of the whole thing?
Make me a murderer?

45:41.783 --> 45:42.826
Of course not.

45:44.912 --> 45:47.706
But you very conveniently blacked out
during the depressurization.

45:47.706 --> 45:50.167
You tell me how fucking convenient it is

45:50.167 --> 45:52.586
to wake up with the corpses
of your friends.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.047
Listen, we're going round in circles.

45:57.299 --> 45:59.176
I take an evidence-based approach.

46:00.010 --> 46:02.346
- Thirty years a senior police officer.
- Please.

46:02.346 --> 46:04.515
Sixty years military pilot.

46:04.515 --> 46:06.225
Theoretical physicist.

46:06.225 --> 46:09.353
- Astronaut.
- Depressive. Alcoholic.

46:22.282 --> 46:23.408
Can you help me?

46:23.408 --> 46:24.493
What?

46:25.035 --> 46:26.286
'Cause you're right.

46:26.286 --> 46:29.081
There are black holes.
There are things I don't recall.

46:30.791 --> 46:32.876
- Like what?
- I fixed it...

46:35.879 --> 46:38.340
I fixed everything on Apollo 18.

46:39.007 --> 46:42.094
Those guys were alive,
and then suddenly they were dead.

46:43.136 --> 46:44.763
I'm sorry, how can you have fixed it?

46:49.142 --> 46:50.143
I fixed it.

46:58.861 --> 47:02.573
We went all the way to the fucking moon,
and I didn't fuck up once.

47:03.615 --> 47:05.993
- It was Henry's fault.
- What?

47:05.993 --> 47:09.663
Fifty years of brandy and pills.
Henry Caldera.

47:11.748 --> 47:13.000
Henry?

47:18.213 --> 47:20.007
- You wanna help me?
- You wanna take a step back?

47:20.007 --> 47:22.509
'Cause I should not be standing here

47:22.509 --> 47:25.637
talking to a fucking ugly asshole
like you.

47:26.305 --> 47:28.307
You wanna know how I know I was there?

47:28.307 --> 47:31.685
Because I got a fucking hole in my head.

47:31.685 --> 47:34.605
You don't know,
because you didn't live it.

47:35.814 --> 47:36.815
Neither did you.

47:40.152 --> 47:42.070
- Moron.
- Failure.

47:42.070 --> 47:44.114
- No, no, no.
- Fraud.

47:50.746 --> 47:54.291
You know-- I'm just not a fucking fraud!

48:20.192 --> 48:23.403
Mummy, I don't think there is
another cabin.

48:23.904 --> 48:24.905
I think...

48:26.782 --> 48:27.616
What?

48:29.618 --> 48:34.748
People can see things sometimes
when they're upset.

48:36.166 --> 48:40.462
And people who have been to space,

48:41.255 --> 48:42.589
they've seen things.

48:50.722 --> 48:51.890
I don't wanna hurt you...

48:54.935 --> 49:00.524
I really don't wanna make you upset,
but I think you're right...

49:04.152 --> 49:05.696
I don't think you're my daughter.

49:08.448 --> 49:11.660
But if I'm not, then who are you?

49:16.206 --> 49:17.875
What have you done to my mummy?
