00:34.800 --> 00:36.903
<i> Something strange is happening.</i>

00:39.071 --> 00:43.109
<i> We are living through the most
extraordinary moment in human history.</i>

00:44.910 --> 00:47.346
<i> After decades of
denial and ridicule,</i>

00:47.379 --> 00:50.116
<i> government officials
and the mainstream media</i>

00:50.149 --> 00:55.555
<i> are admitting that extraterrestrial
civilizations are visiting Earth.</i>

00:55.588 --> 00:58.624
<i> But, there's a twist.</i>

00:58.657 --> 01:02.295
<i> The same people and institutions
who lied about ETs,</i>

01:02.328 --> 01:04.030
<i> and just about
everything else,</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:08.267
<i> are now framing the extraterrestrial
presence as a threat.</i>

01:08.300 --> 01:12.371
And we are seriously thinking
of the Space Force.

01:12.404 --> 01:16.909
<i> One man has been trying
to warn us about this for decades.</i>

01:16.942 --> 01:19.745
<i> If you're seeing this,
it's because I'm either dead,</i>

01:19.778 --> 01:23.149
<i> or have been entrapped,
or have disappeared.</i>

01:23.182 --> 01:25.284
<i> Most of us are ill-prepared</i>

01:25.317 --> 01:29.422
<i> for open contact with
an advanced ET civilization.</i>

01:29.455 --> 01:34.560
<i> As our expanding cosmology
outgrows our theological institutions,</i>

01:34.593 --> 01:38.998
<i> modern human society
is spiraling into decadence,</i>

01:39.031 --> 01:42.768
<i> narcissism, depravity,
and nihilism.</i>

01:42.801 --> 01:45.138
Catch me outside.
How about that?

01:45.171 --> 01:48.407
<i> If we want to truly
understand ETs,</i>

01:48.440 --> 01:51.577
<i> their technology
and their intentions,</i>

01:51.610 --> 01:55.815
<i> we have to readdress our assumptions
about the nature of reality</i>

01:55.848 --> 01:58.952
<i> and our relationship
with the physical universe.</i>

02:05.724 --> 02:07.827
On the surface,
"Oh, UFOs are real.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.297
"They are these machines
zipping through the sky."

02:11.330 --> 02:13.966
But one of the things
I've always said is,

02:13.999 --> 02:17.036
"Well, that's interesting
and it's cool,

02:17.069 --> 02:19.438
"and it's great to see them.
But what's really interesting

02:19.471 --> 02:22.108
"are the people on board
those spacecraft.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.377
"They're intelligent.
They're conscious.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.212
"They're here.
They're interested.

02:26.245 --> 02:28.347
"Why are they here,
otherwise?"

02:28.380 --> 02:30.483
But no one has
made the question,

02:30.516 --> 02:33.152
"How do we develop
that relationship

02:33.185 --> 02:37.456
"with the occupants
of the UFOs?"

02:37.489 --> 02:39.358
That's what this is about.

02:39.391 --> 02:42.228
It's going from just sort of
a materialistic view,

02:42.261 --> 02:46.632
there' s a machine flying around the sky,
and sort of a superficial view of it,

02:46.665 --> 02:49.468
<i> to a deeper truth of,
"Who's on board?</i>

02:49.501 --> 02:51.470
"Why are they here?

02:51.503 --> 02:53.973
"What is their relationship
to humanity?"

02:54.006 --> 02:57.376
Perhaps the origins
of the human race.

02:57.409 --> 03:01.080
What are we to do to create
a relationship with them?

03:01.113 --> 03:02.915
And how do we do that?

03:02.948 --> 03:08.321
What is the foundation of a relationship
between humans, at this stage

03:08.354 --> 03:12.592
of our evolution, and civilizations that
are hundreds of thousands

03:12.625 --> 03:16.195
to millions of years more developed,
technologically

03:16.228 --> 03:18.764
and socially and perhaps
in consciousness.

03:18.797 --> 03:22.034
We have to find where that point
of commonality is.

03:22.067 --> 03:25.271
<i> I have put a briefing together
for every president since Bill Clinton,</i>

03:25.304 --> 03:27.740
<i> and, to the extent
that they know anything,</i>

03:27.773 --> 03:30.710
<i> it doesn't mean they have control
over these covert programs.</i>

03:30.743 --> 03:35.681
<i> The unacknowledged special access projects
are run in a way that they are outside</i>

03:35.714 --> 03:39.719
<i> the purview and control of the president
or the Congress.</i>

03:39.752 --> 03:41.587
<i> And for that reason,</i>

03:41.620 --> 03:44.590
<i> our elected representatives are unlikely
to resolve this problem.</i>

03:44.623 --> 03:48.894
But we can resolve it, by going directly
to these civilizations and saying,

03:48.927 --> 03:50.529
<i> "We're here.</i>

03:50.562 --> 03:54.600
<i> "You can make contact with us.
We're unarmed. We're friendly."</i>

03:54.633 --> 03:56.302
<i> Since 1990,</i>

03:56.335 --> 04:00.706
<i> a network of freethinkers and renegades
had been bypassing</i>

04:00.739 --> 04:04.410
<i> the National Security State
to make direct contact</i>

04:04.443 --> 04:08.047
<i> with advanced
extraterrestrial civilizations,</i>

04:08.080 --> 04:11.484
<i> using the Close Encounters
of the Fifth Kind protocols,</i>

04:11.517 --> 04:15.821
<i> or CE5, developed
by Dr. Greer.</i>

04:15.854 --> 04:20.392
<i> This has proven to be the most
subversive and dangerous information</i>

04:20.426 --> 04:22.328
<i> he has released
to the public.</i>

04:23.962 --> 04:26.732
<i> Oh, my gosh!</i>

04:28.000 --> 04:29.802
<i> What the fuck?</i>
<i> Look at this.</i>

04:36.842 --> 04:39.345
<i> These three lights,
they keep coming together,</i>

04:39.378 --> 04:41.114
<i> and they fucking blow apart.
Watch this.</i>

04:42.281 --> 04:43.816
<i> Look at them.
Look at 'em.</i>

04:51.357 --> 04:53.993
<i> There goes one. Now the two lights.
There it goes.</i>

04:55.394 --> 04:56.762
<i> Boom.</i>

04:56.795 --> 04:58.698
<i> Close Encounters
of the First Kind</i>

04:58.731 --> 05:00.800
<i> consist of visual sightings</i>

05:00.833 --> 05:02.869
<i> of an unidentified
flying object.</i>

05:05.571 --> 05:07.807
<i> Close Encounters of
the Second Kind,</i>

05:07.840 --> 05:12.278
<i>some physical trace is present,
like impressions in the ground</i>

05:12.311 --> 05:14.013
<i> or scorched vegetation.</i>

05:15.514 --> 05:17.149
<i> Close Encounters of
the Third Kind,</i>

05:17.182 --> 05:21.887
<i> the occupants or pilots
of an ET craft are witnessed.</i>

05:21.920 --> 05:24.623
<i> Close Encounters of
the Fourth Kind,</i>

05:24.656 --> 05:27.894
<i> a human is brought on board
an ET craft.</i>

05:29.361 --> 05:32.565
<i> Close Encounters of
the Fifth Kind,</i>

05:32.598 --> 05:38.004
<i> proactive, human-initiated communication
with extraterrestrial beings.</i>

05:49.448 --> 05:53.186
<i> For thousands of people,
contact has begun.</i>

05:54.219 --> 05:56.255
<i> This is their story.</i>

06:49.675 --> 06:53.245
Look, there's four!
There's four!

06:53.278 --> 06:55.915
Holy damn hot shit!

07:05.457 --> 07:06.859
<i> Come on, baby.
Don't go away.</i>

07:16.935 --> 07:19.138
This got on the radar
of the intelligence community,

07:19.171 --> 07:21.474
<i> and they knew that
we had come across</i>

07:21.507 --> 07:23.976
<i> the Rosetta Stone
of contacting</i>

07:24.009 --> 07:27.847
and communicating with interstellar
civilizations, and it worked.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.916
<i> That is what started
the intelligence community</i>

07:30.949 --> 07:35.287
<i> coming after what we were saying
and doing and trying to intercept it.</i>

07:35.320 --> 07:39.825
This is, in fact, cosmic
disobedience on a grand scale.

07:39.858 --> 07:44.830
<i> We're gonna bypass the sociopaths
in these covert programs,</i>

07:44.863 --> 07:46.499
<i> and do this directly.</i>

07:46.532 --> 07:48.267
<i> It's the same thing with
The Civil Rights Movement.</i>

07:48.300 --> 07:51.804
The Civil Rights Movement would have
never happened from the top down.

07:51.837 --> 07:55.207
<i> Even the Kennedy brothers did not
want to step into that mess.</i>

07:55.240 --> 07:57.676
<i> It took a mass of people,</i>

07:57.709 --> 07:59.879
<i> not just Martin Luther King,
but millions of people,</i>

07:59.912 --> 08:03.782
<i> all over the country doing sit-ins
and lunch counter sit-ins,</i>

08:03.815 --> 08:07.786
<i> and buses and what have you
to change that direction</i>

08:07.819 --> 08:12.291
of our civilization out of Jim Crow,
onto a society that is,

08:12.324 --> 08:16.195
while not perfect, is more open
and inclusive than it was.

08:16.228 --> 08:18.297
The same has
to happen here.

08:18.330 --> 08:22.134
<i> And to do that, we have to understand
what cosmic consciousness is,</i>

08:22.167 --> 08:24.370
<i> what the nature
of the cosmic mind is,</i>

08:24.403 --> 08:28.073
<i> that is resonating within every
single human being,</i>

08:28.106 --> 08:31.844
<i> because that's the foundation
for the relationship between humans</i>

08:31.877 --> 08:33.812
<i> and these civilizations.</i>

08:33.845 --> 08:37.850
<i> By doing it directly, all of us
are going to know what the truth is.</i>

08:37.883 --> 08:41.687
<i> You don't have to go through a proxy
or someone who's telling you second hand.</i>

08:41.720 --> 08:44.557
But it also creates
a movement globally,

08:44.590 --> 08:48.894
<i> to show these civilizations
that there are people on this planet</i>

08:48.927 --> 08:52.831
<i> who are enlightened and conscious
and peaceful,</i>

08:52.864 --> 08:54.867
<i> which is the majority
of humans.</i>

08:54.900 --> 08:59.705
Because real disclosure is humans making
contact with these civilizations directly.

08:59.738 --> 09:02.107
And these civilizations
are waiting for us to do it,

09:02.140 --> 09:05.177
so this is our opportunity.
This is our moment.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.281
And it really is we the people
that have to do it.

09:13.318 --> 09:16.755
For decades, only crackpots
and crazy people

09:16.788 --> 09:19.191
believed in UFOs. That's what
I thought, anyway.

09:19.224 --> 09:22.227
And then in recent years,
it turns out,

09:22.260 --> 09:25.931
that governments have been
taking them seriously all along,

09:25.964 --> 09:27.366
very seriously.

12:20.305 --> 12:22.741
<i> The question
is often asked,</i>

12:22.774 --> 12:25.811
<i> "When will UFO
disclosure happen?"</i>

12:25.844 --> 12:29.782
<i> The answer is, "It has
already happened."</i>

12:29.815 --> 12:35.220
<i> It happened in 2001, at the National
Press Club in Washington, D.C.,</i>

12:35.253 --> 12:39.391
<i> where military, NASA and Intelligence
Agency whistleblowers</i>

12:39.424 --> 12:43.228
<i>testified to their involvement
in the UFO cover-up,</i>

12:43.261 --> 12:46.999
<i> and the back engineering
of extraterrestrial technologies.</i>

12:48.133 --> 12:50.936
<i> It happened again,
in 2017,</i>

12:50.969 --> 12:53.472
<i> with the release
of the film,</i> Unacknowledged,

12:53.505 --> 12:57.442
<i> in the anticipation of which,
the CIA and the FBI</i>

12:57.475 --> 13:01.680
<i> published millions of UFO
documents on their websites.</i>

13:03.682 --> 13:06.151
<i> Despite all this,</i>

13:06.184 --> 13:08.520
<i> nothing has really changed.</i>

13:08.553 --> 13:10.789
<i> Life goes on as before,</i>

13:10.822 --> 13:15.761
<i> except there is a new narrative
unfolding in the mainstream media.</i>

13:15.794 --> 13:19.431
<i> One that is designed
to subvert true disclosure</i>

13:19.464 --> 13:23.802
<i>and extinguish the opportunity
for transformation available to us</i>

13:23.835 --> 13:25.771
<i> through these revelations.</i>

13:25.804 --> 13:28.774
Earlier this week, the <i> New York Times</i>
and <i>Politico</i> revealed

13:28.807 --> 13:31.443
the existence of a secret
government program

13:31.476 --> 13:33.679
to investigate
UFO sightings.

13:33.712 --> 13:37.516
It was especially focused on encounters
by members of the military,

13:37.549 --> 13:41.687
like this one experienced by a US Navy pilot,
off the coast of California.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.571
Average people see UFOs
on the news, right?

13:59.604 --> 14:03.342
All of a sudden, it's real. UFOs,
we've been tracking them in the sky.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.912
And they go, "Okay, well,
were the tin foil hat people right?"

14:06.945 --> 14:10.716
It took a long time for the mainstream
media to finally admit that,

14:10.749 --> 14:12.918
<i> "Yeah, they are,
in fact, real."</i>

14:12.951 --> 14:16.188
<i> Why did we wait that long?
Why did we wait for the mainstream media</i>

14:16.221 --> 14:19.324
<i> to tell us before we finally believed,
"Hey, this is actually happening?"</i>

14:19.357 --> 14:23.562
And the challenge is, if there's
potentially multiple narratives,

14:23.595 --> 14:26.265
how do you decide
which one to go with?

14:26.298 --> 14:29.735
Back in the 1990s,
I was read into or briefed

14:29.768 --> 14:33.906
on a project that involved
an inter-agency group,

14:33.939 --> 14:39.444
<i> that had the ability to disclose
the ET presence in a way</i>

14:39.477 --> 14:43.882
that would frighten everyone on Earth
and convince the public that there was

14:43.915 --> 14:45.584
"an alien threat,"

14:45.617 --> 14:48.253
which is completely false.
It's all a lie.

14:48.286 --> 14:51.223
<i> And that this had been developed
in the '50s.</i>

14:51.256 --> 14:55.594
<i> And they had been developing
the means and the psychological warfare</i>

14:55.627 --> 14:57.529
to make that happen.

14:57.562 --> 15:01.433
So, in the 1990s, I wrote a paper called
"When Disclosure Serves Secrecy."

15:02.300 --> 15:03.769
<i> What that means is,</i>

15:03.802 --> 15:06.271
there are two kinds of disclosures
that might happen,

15:06.304 --> 15:09.274
a truthful one that is
also a hopeful one,

15:09.307 --> 15:13.545
<i> which is what I gave up my medical
career to try to actuate to do.</i>

15:13.578 --> 15:15.814
And then, there's the one
that is spun

15:15.847 --> 15:18.417
<i> by the spinmeisters
in Washington,</i>

15:18.450 --> 15:21.787
and at The Pentagon and CIA,
which runs like this.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.889
<i> "It's true
the UFOs are real.</i>

15:23.922 --> 15:27.893
<i> "They are here as a threat.
They're violating our airspace.</i>

15:27.926 --> 15:32.230
<i> "They're a National Security threat,
and a threat to our sovereignty."</i>

15:32.263 --> 15:33.298
I'm quoting.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.833
The purpose
of the program,

15:34.866 --> 15:38.236
advanced aerospace threat
identification program,

15:38.269 --> 15:41.273
was really designed
to do just that.

15:41.306 --> 15:43.642
From a national
security perspective,

15:43.675 --> 15:46.778
identify those
things that we see

15:46.811 --> 15:50.849
and try to ascertain and determine
if that information is a potential threat

15:50.882 --> 15:52.084
to national security.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.019
And we knew this was
going to happen,

15:54.052 --> 15:55.954
because I had met
with people

15:55.987 --> 16:00.425
who were in these classified projects
who were on inter-agency committees

16:00.458 --> 16:02.761
that had everything set
to roll this out,

16:02.794 --> 16:04.496
and they were just
waiting for the right time.

16:04.529 --> 16:08.200
<i> The Soviet Union has ended.
We have the global terrorism.</i>

16:08.233 --> 16:11.036
<i> While it's still there,
it's not like it was around 9/11.</i>

16:11.069 --> 16:15.474
This is the next "big thing" that they
want the public to be afraid of.

16:15.507 --> 16:19.111
When a pickpocket meets a saint,
all he sees are his pockets.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.614
Or if you're a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

16:22.647 --> 16:26.218
It's not that this isn't a genuine
perception on their part,

16:26.251 --> 16:30.489
because they've been raised, their entire
political and professional career

16:30.522 --> 16:35.694
<i> has been designed to have this
kind of artificial construct of this...</i>

16:35.727 --> 16:39.531
<i> There's this national airspace
and nobody can come into the airspace</i>

16:39.564 --> 16:41.066
<i> unless we say so.</i>

16:41.099 --> 16:44.169
<i> And they've got this super control
mechanism going.</i>

16:44.202 --> 16:46.805
<i> And they're right at this really
important place right now</i>

16:46.838 --> 16:48.540
<i> where they're attempting
to establish</i>

16:48.573 --> 16:50.642
a kind of
one-world government.

16:50.675 --> 16:52.844
They've got the communications
systems up.

16:52.877 --> 16:54.713
<i> The transportation
systems are up.</i>

16:54.746 --> 16:57.015
<i> They want to establish
a planetary government.</i>

16:57.048 --> 17:00.585
And there is nothing that is going
to motivate the creation

17:00.618 --> 17:04.423
of a one-world government, like the
discovery of an ultimate other.

17:04.455 --> 17:09.560
Ronald Reagan was standing in front of
the United Nations just said it, right out.

17:09.594 --> 17:13.065
Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat.

17:13.098 --> 17:18.036
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences, worldwide,

17:18.069 --> 17:24.041
would vanish, if we were facing
an alien threat from outside this world.

17:24.075 --> 17:27.579
He was silly enough to say it.
That's part of his naivete.

17:27.612 --> 17:29.748
But the fact is,
that is their agenda.

17:29.781 --> 17:32.684
<i> Legendary civil rights attorney
Daniel Sheehan</i>

17:32.717 --> 17:34.553
<i> has spent over 50 years</i>

17:34.586 --> 17:36.788
<i> fighting the National
Security State.</i>

17:36.821 --> 17:40.192
<i> The Pentagon Papers
and the Iran Contra scandals</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:43.095
<i> are but two of his many
landmark cases,</i>

17:43.128 --> 17:46.098
<i> before becoming a whistleblower
and legal counsel</i>

17:46.131 --> 17:48.934
<i> for the Disclosure Project
in 2001.</i>

17:48.967 --> 17:53.038
It's helpful, of course, for them to say,
"Oh, UFOs are real."

17:53.071 --> 17:54.539
<i> That's quite helpful.</i>

17:54.573 --> 17:55.774
<i> We've been trying to get people
to understand that now</i>

17:55.807 --> 17:57.409
<i> for the last 30 years.</i>

17:57.442 --> 18:00.078
<i> But it's all immediately
wedded to</i>

18:00.111 --> 18:02.047
<i> this fact that they're
this horrible threat.</i>

18:02.080 --> 18:05.750
And so we have to come forward
with a positive set of programs,

18:05.783 --> 18:07.619
a positive vision for this,

18:07.652 --> 18:10.222
and that's what I'm trying to help
get the Vatican and the Jesuit order

18:10.255 --> 18:13.992
<i> to become involved in,
in putting forth a discussion</i>

18:14.025 --> 18:16.728
<i> about the theological
and philosophical challenges</i>

18:16.761 --> 18:19.932
that this presents to us,
but it's not a national security threat.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.267
It's not a threat
to our species.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.635
It's not a threat
to our planet.

18:23.668 --> 18:25.770
<i> It's a threat to our view
as ourselves,</i>

18:25.803 --> 18:30.242
<i> as the be-all and end-all,
that the entire universe was created</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:34.179
<i> as a stage on which to play out
the human drama for one single species.</i>

18:35.180 --> 18:36.515
That ain't so.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.150
But let's get used to it.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.819
And let's figure out
what the new story is.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.254
<i> What is the new story?</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:44.756
<i> There's a positive story.
What is our role in it?</i>

18:44.789 --> 18:47.592
<i> We may not be
the star of it,</i>

18:47.625 --> 18:52.164
<i> but we're a good supporting character
in the unfolding of our universe.</i>

18:52.197 --> 18:54.633
<i> And let's figure out
what that story is.</i>

18:54.666 --> 18:57.936
The success of <i> Unacknowledged,</i>
which has been seen by

18:57.969 --> 18:59.671
hundreds of millions
of people now...

18:59.704 --> 19:01.206
Have you not
watched <i> Unacknowledged?</i>

19:01.239 --> 19:02.641
What is <i>Unacknowledged?</i>

19:02.674 --> 19:04.476
-You gotta watch <i> Unacknowledged.</i>
-What is that one?

19:04.509 --> 19:07.145
-Okay. You gotta watch <i> Unacknowledged.</i>
-What is it?

19:07.178 --> 19:08.847
You gotta watch
<i> Unacknowledged.</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:10.649
Is that that
Steven Greer movie?

19:10.682 --> 19:13.318
<i> It caused a reaction within
the intelligence community</i>

19:13.351 --> 19:17.689
<i> of the United States. And so,
what the major media has begun to do</i>

19:17.722 --> 19:21.159
<i> is to cooperate with the intelligence
community in reporting</i>

19:21.192 --> 19:22.861
<i> all this information out,</i>

19:22.894 --> 19:27.832
<i> but with this peculiar spin,
very subliminal at this stage,</i>

19:27.865 --> 19:29.568
that it's a threat.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.970
<i> The project was called
the Advanced Aviation Threat</i>

19:32.003 --> 19:33.505
<i> Identification Program,</i>

19:33.538 --> 19:36.041
<i> run by an official
named Luis Elizondo.</i>

19:36.074 --> 19:38.510
I think this is a national
security imperative.

19:38.543 --> 19:43.248
<i> We have clear things that we
do not understand how they work,</i>

19:43.281 --> 19:46.685
<i> operating in areas
that we can't control.</i>

19:46.718 --> 19:49.087
One of my first cases,
coming out of law school,

19:49.587 --> 19:51.590
<i> was for NBC,</i>

19:51.623 --> 19:54.693
to establish the right of journalists
to protect their confidential news sources.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.028
<i> I did the Amicus briefs for</i>
The New York Times

19:57.061 --> 19:58.496
<i> and</i> The Washington Post

19:58.529 --> 20:00.732
<i> and also for CBS and ABC.</i>

20:00.765 --> 20:03.235
<i> And it was at that time
that I began to realize</i>

20:03.268 --> 20:06.071
that there was this close
working relationship

20:06.104 --> 20:08.340
between the board of editors
of <i> The New York Times</i>

20:08.373 --> 20:10.041
and the national security
community.

20:10.074 --> 20:12.244
<i> That there's conversations
going on all the time</i>

20:12.277 --> 20:15.413
<i> between the Board of Editors
and the national security people.</i>

20:15.446 --> 20:19.217
And we actually got an affidavit
from Teddy Sorenson saying,

20:19.250 --> 20:23.288
<i> "Oh, yes, the National Security
State and CIA and everybody consult</i>

20:23.321 --> 20:26.858
<i> "regularly with </i> The New York Times <i>
to get them not to tell</i>

20:26.891 --> 20:30.195
<i> "information about covert operations
that we're engaged in."</i>

20:30.228 --> 20:34.232
I was surprised to find that out
at that point.

20:34.265 --> 20:36.534
<i> I began to do
an investigation about this,</i>

20:36.567 --> 20:40.038
<i> as a lawyer for</i>
The Times <i> and for NBC,</i>

20:40.071 --> 20:44.576
<i> and found out that there were 42
full-time Central Intelligence Agency</i>

20:44.609 --> 20:48.880
<i> or NSA people employed
by the major national news media.</i>

20:48.913 --> 20:52.083
<i>And they had an entire project
called Project Mockingbird,</i>

20:52.116 --> 20:56.087
<i> and that they were deeply embedded
with the major national news media.</i>

20:56.120 --> 20:59.591
And they were constantly, from their
point of view, safeguarding

20:59.624 --> 21:02.394
the information that was going
to be allowed to get out.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.729
And it was quite clear
that they viewed themselves

21:04.762 --> 21:08.099
as all part of the same
basic fraternity.

21:08.132 --> 21:12.971
<i> They all shared in the patriotic vision
of the Central Intelligence Agency</i>

21:13.004 --> 21:14.506
<i> being able to
go around the world.</i>

21:14.539 --> 21:16.675
<i> The biggest
challenge with them,</i>

21:16.708 --> 21:20.445
<i> the Pentagon Papers case, is they didn't
want to reveal the fact that there was</i>

21:20.478 --> 21:22.847
<i> a massive assassination
program going on.</i>

21:22.880 --> 21:25.684
<i> And it was being funded
by heroin trafficking,</i>

21:25.717 --> 21:29.688
<i> to keep it away from the congressional
funding investigations.</i>

21:29.721 --> 21:32.857
I thought this was a terribly
newsworthy thing to tell about,

21:32.890 --> 21:34.759
but it was
beyond the pale.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.961
That was not to be
talked about here.

21:36.994 --> 21:39.431
<i> You can talk about how bad
the Vietnam War was,</i>

21:39.464 --> 21:43.201
<i> and even the fact that they lied
about the Bay of Tonkin incident.</i>

21:43.234 --> 21:44.803
<i> But not this.</i>

21:44.836 --> 21:47.706
Even the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations officer,

21:47.739 --> 21:51.676
Richard Doty, admitted
that he would bring bags of cash

21:51.709 --> 21:54.612
to national security editors
in the major media

21:54.645 --> 21:57.883
to get their cooperation
in this narrative.

21:58.549 --> 22:02.987
So every news agency,

22:03.020 --> 22:05.323
every television,
radio station,

22:05.356 --> 22:07.826
in the Albuquerque
or Santa Fe area,

22:07.859 --> 22:10.795
had our snitches in there.

22:10.828 --> 22:13.331
So we knew.
And we paid 'em.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.233
We paid 'em good money.

22:15.266 --> 22:18.503
One of the reasons you get
the people, is you pay 'em.

22:18.536 --> 22:20.672
And that was controversial.

22:20.705 --> 22:22.874
That was
somewhat controversial.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.979
Oh, yes. I'm not going
to name them.

22:28.012 --> 22:31.583
What you have now
is a concerted effort

22:31.616 --> 22:33.885
between mainstream media
and social media platforms

22:33.918 --> 22:37.555
and tech giants to say, "Let's gain
control back of the narratives

22:37.588 --> 22:40.825
<i> "that we require to make sure
that we can control</i>

22:40.858 --> 22:42.694
<i> "how people think
about certain topics."</i>

22:42.727 --> 22:45.063
<i> So, now you have
this fear driven,</i>

22:45.096 --> 22:50.168
you have this tight little box of what
the UFO and extraterrestrial

22:50.201 --> 22:51.736
subject is really about.

22:51.769 --> 22:55.206
How it relates to military,
government spending, weapons,

22:55.239 --> 22:59.177
all this sort of conversations that are
very common in the mainstream

22:59.210 --> 23:00.678
that people are
going to relate to.

23:00.711 --> 23:02.881
That they,
"Okay, I can piece

23:02.914 --> 23:05.216
"the typical dots together."

23:05.249 --> 23:07.752
Let me give you
a great example.

23:07.785 --> 23:10.789
<i> If you look at a lot of
the Disclosure Project materials,</i>

23:10.822 --> 23:12.857
<i> which is beyond
the scope of this film,</i>

23:12.890 --> 23:16.461
<i>we identified dozens of people who
were at intercontinental ballistic missile,</i>

23:16.494 --> 23:21.299
<i> nuclear silos, nuclear weapons areas,
who had had UFOs come in</i>

23:21.332 --> 23:23.701
<i> to those areas, surveilling them.
But in some cases,</i>

23:23.734 --> 23:26.070
<i> rendering those missiles
unlaunchable.</i>

23:26.103 --> 23:28.773
Now, most of the men
that were in those silos

23:28.806 --> 23:32.644
have said to me, personally, they
felt that these ETs were saying,

23:32.677 --> 23:36.281
<i> "Please don't blow up this
beautiful planet. But if you do,</i>

23:36.314 --> 23:38.917
<i> "if you go to mutual assured
destruction,</i>

23:38.950 --> 23:43.054
<i> "the full launch of nuclear weapons,
globally, we can intercept a lot of them,</i>

23:43.087 --> 23:46.124
<i> "so that you don't go to a full
extinction-level event."</i>

23:46.157 --> 23:49.961
They felt that it was actually
a very hopeful thing that happened.

23:49.994 --> 23:54.299
Meanwhile, people came along,
took the same data, the same cases,

23:54.332 --> 23:56.935
and spun it into
a national security threat.

23:56.968 --> 23:59.737
One set of facts,
two narratives.

23:59.770 --> 24:02.273
Diametrically opposed.
Opposite.

24:02.306 --> 24:06.010
When I got involved in
the issue of the UFO issue,

24:06.043 --> 24:11.349
and the ET issue, that started in 1977,
with President Carter, I realized

24:11.382 --> 24:15.086
that the work that I was doing
was characterized

24:15.119 --> 24:16.921
by the National Security State

24:16.954 --> 24:19.757
as a target for
counterintelligence activities.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.595
<i>When I see this thing happening
with the To The Stars Academy,</i>

24:23.628 --> 24:27.198
<i> where they suddenly appear on the
front page of </i> The New York Times,

24:27.231 --> 24:30.268
and the CNN, all of a sudden,
wants to talk with them,

24:30.301 --> 24:32.937
and they're on MSNBC,
and all this kind of stuff,

24:32.970 --> 24:36.674
I immediately realized,
"Wait a second.

24:36.707 --> 24:39.477
"This is part of what I've been worried
about coming out,"

24:39.510 --> 24:44.182
because they were constantly spinning
that story that this is a threat.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.018
My name is Tom Delonge.
A lot of people know me

24:47.051 --> 24:51.389
from my band Blink 182.
I started that band when I was 16.

24:51.422 --> 24:54.325
<i> Through a series of meetings,
I was soon connected to a large group</i>

24:54.358 --> 24:56.027
<i> of US government officials,</i>

24:56.060 --> 24:58.563
<i> from the CIA,
the Department of Defense</i>

24:58.596 --> 25:00.565
<i> and Lockheed Martin
Skunk Works.</i>

25:00.598 --> 25:04.335
<i> These guys were the ones involved
in the secretive US government programs</i>

25:04.368 --> 25:06.037
<i> that dealt with
these subjects.</i>

25:06.070 --> 25:08.373
<i> What's happening is that
To The Stars Academy people,</i>

25:08.406 --> 25:10.442
were all... You know,
Jim Semivan who's there,

25:12.109 --> 25:15.313
the Chief of Covert Operations
Domestic for CIA,

25:15.346 --> 25:17.582
which in and of itself
is totally against the law.

25:17.615 --> 25:21.019
You know, the National Security
Act from 1947, completely, clearly

25:21.052 --> 25:24.422
and unequivocally prohibits any kind
of covert operations stateside.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.058
That's who he is.

25:27.091 --> 25:30.194
There he is there, and you got
guys from the DIA,

25:30.227 --> 25:32.897
<i> and the Defense Department
and Hal Puthoff and stuff.</i>

25:32.930 --> 25:37.368
<i> And they're all there, and what
they're doing is they're putting</i>

25:37.401 --> 25:41.072
<i> this intense spin, every single
thing they talk about,</i>

25:41.105 --> 25:45.009
all has this kind of gestalt to it
that this is a threat.

25:45.042 --> 25:47.078
And it very well
could be a threat.

25:47.111 --> 25:50.081
It's a threat to
our national security.

25:50.114 --> 25:52.517
It's a threat to
our air space.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.852
It's a threat to
our sovereignty.

25:54.885 --> 25:59.791
What it is, it's a threat to our
dominion over our own planet.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.794
And, of course
they think that's their job.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.964
Our job is to assert
full spectrum dominance

26:05.997 --> 26:08.366
<i> over the entire planet.
We actually have the documents</i>

26:08.399 --> 26:10.702
<i> from the 1992
United States Defense</i>

26:10.735 --> 26:12.804
<i> Department Policy
Planning Guidance document,</i>

26:12.837 --> 26:16.441
<i> where they said that right
at the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</i>

26:16.474 --> 26:19.444
<i> They said, "Oh, we gotta not cut
back on our military spending.</i>

26:19.477 --> 26:22.447
<i> "We have to increase it,
so we can establish full-spectrum</i>

26:22.480 --> 26:24.148
"dominance over the planet."

26:24.181 --> 26:27.085
So you know what their agenda is,
the National Security State.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.387
It's not for the defense
of our sovereignty.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.223
The danger of this,
of course, is that this is exactly

26:32.256 --> 26:37.662
what all fascistic demagogues
do to an innocent target,

26:37.695 --> 26:39.430
<i> whether it be
Jews in Germany,</i>

26:39.463 --> 26:41.599
<i> or African-Americans
in this country.</i>

26:41.632 --> 26:45.136
They will create
a boogeyman effect

26:45.169 --> 26:47.939
<i> to try to get people
mobilized against it.</i>

26:47.972 --> 26:51.142
You're one
ugly motherfucker.

26:53.778 --> 26:57.281
And as one member
of the royal family told me,

26:57.314 --> 27:00.251
"We need to do things
so that the public will accept

27:00.284 --> 27:04.455
"in blood and treasure
the sacrifices needed

27:04.488 --> 27:07.992
"to have an interplanetary war."
I'm quoting.

27:08.025 --> 27:10.194
<i> Bombshell CIA documents,</i>

27:10.227 --> 27:12.797
<i> previously published
by The Disclosure Project,</i>

27:12.830 --> 27:17.101
<i> reveal a decades-long
psychological warfare campaign</i>

27:17.134 --> 27:21.439
<i>to cultivate a culture of fear
towards extraterrestrials.</i>

27:21.472 --> 27:25.309
It's interesting that Hollywood
and the clandestine services

27:25.342 --> 27:27.979
both spend most of their time
convincing people that something

27:28.012 --> 27:29.947
that's not true
is in fact, true.

27:29.980 --> 27:33.518
I think, probably Hollywood is full
of CIA agents and we just don't know it.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.220
And I wouldn't be surprised
at all to discover that.

27:36.253 --> 27:38.322
<i> This is extremely common.</i>

27:38.355 --> 27:40.191
<i> Intelligence assets

27:40.224 --> 27:42.026
<i> have made
billions of dollars</i>

27:42.059 --> 27:46.064
<i> popularizing the narrative that
humanity's first encounter with ETs</i>

27:46.097 --> 27:49.067
<i> will be a devastating
bloodbath.</i>

27:49.100 --> 27:52.370
Mr. Chambers,
don't get on that ship!

27:52.403 --> 27:57.241
The rest of the book,
"To Serve Man..." It's a cookbook.

28:37.114 --> 28:41.285
Let's go out into space and look
at our planet over the last 100 years.

28:41.318 --> 28:44.722
<i> World wars. Hundreds of millions
of people killed in war,</i>

28:44.755 --> 28:47.091
<i> the advent of weapons
of mass destruction,</i>

28:47.124 --> 28:51.095
<i> our going into space in a
competitive way with the Soviet Union</i>

28:51.128 --> 28:52.964
<i> for the Apollo projects
and others.</i>

28:52.997 --> 28:55.733
<i> The degradation and destruction
of our environment,</i>

28:55.766 --> 29:00.471
our targeting of extraterrestrial assets
around the Earth and in space,

29:00.504 --> 29:04.909
and successfully killing many ETs
and downing their spacecraft.

29:04.942 --> 29:06.811
Out here in Fort Huachuca
in Arizona,

29:06.844 --> 29:09.380
<i>there's an underground facility
where there are nine different</i>

29:09.413 --> 29:12.283
<i> ET craft that are there
with all the autopsied bodies.</i>

29:12.316 --> 29:15.086
<i> There's a man on my team
who used to work in that facility,</i>

29:15.119 --> 29:18.556
near Tombstone, Arizona,
not coincidentally, perhaps.

29:18.589 --> 29:22.293
<i> This footage, captured by NASA's</i>
Discovery <i> space shuttle</i>

29:22.326 --> 29:25.129
<i> on September 15th, 1991,</i>

29:25.162 --> 29:29.500
<i> shows an extraterrestrial vehicle
dodge an electronic weapon</i>

29:29.533 --> 29:31.169
<i> fired from Earth.</i>

29:31.202 --> 29:35.239
<i> Here, we see the craft
slowly crossing the frame.</i>

29:35.272 --> 29:39.410
<i> There's a bright flash and then
it makes an abrupt right angle turn</i>

29:39.443 --> 29:42.180
<i> and flies off.
Moments after the turn,</i>

29:42.213 --> 29:46.551
<i> we see the shot fired across space,
where the craft had just been.</i>

29:49.186 --> 29:51.022
Knowing all that,

29:51.055 --> 29:55.493
if they were hostile, in the way we
think of an invading hostile force,

29:55.526 --> 29:57.829
that would have been made
abundantly clear to us

29:57.862 --> 30:00.531
the day we detonated
the first atomic bomb.

30:00.564 --> 30:03.801
The fact is, they have shown
remarkable restraint.

30:03.834 --> 30:07.305
Almost the level of
a Gandhian pacifism,

30:07.338 --> 30:09.373
not to have
pushed back.

30:09.406 --> 30:13.177
So the threat isn't extraterrestrial,
the threat is covert human.

30:13.210 --> 30:16.948
These secret projects are
an existential threat to Earth,

30:16.981 --> 30:19.817
the environment,
and to our peace in space

30:19.850 --> 30:21.719
in relationship with
these civilizations.

30:21.752 --> 30:24.021
<i> I remember being at Wright
Patterson Air Force Base,</i>

30:24.054 --> 30:26.157
<i> where a lot of
the Roswell stuff ended up,</i>

30:26.190 --> 30:28.793
and it was the foreign technology
division of the Air Force,

30:28.826 --> 30:31.863
and I was there to do a briefing
and the colonel said, "Well,

30:31.896 --> 30:34.498
<i> "what if these civilizations
are a threat?"</i>

30:34.531 --> 30:39.737
He was trying to bring me into that view.
And I said, "Sir, with all due respect,

30:39.770 --> 30:43.541
"given the galactically stupid
things you have been doing,

30:43.574 --> 30:46.143
"if they were a threat,
you would know it by now,

30:46.176 --> 30:48.913
"and we would not be having
this conversation and breathing

30:48.946 --> 30:50.581
"the free air of Earth.

30:50.614 --> 30:53.384
"It would have been point,
set, match, over."

30:53.417 --> 30:58.522
<i> What are the technologies that would
permit an interstellar civilization</i>

30:58.555 --> 31:00.892
<i> to go from one star system
to another?</i>

31:00.925 --> 31:04.195
We're not talking
about Elon Musk's SpaceX

31:04.228 --> 31:05.663
<i> or the Apollo rocket.</i>

31:05.696 --> 31:07.665
We're talking
technologically,

31:07.698 --> 31:10.568
advances that are in
the hundreds of thousands

31:10.601 --> 31:14.672
to millions of years past what we
have operating on this planet.

31:14.705 --> 31:16.908
Those technological
breakthroughs,

31:16.941 --> 31:21.212
if they were weaponized and in the
possession of a hostile force,

31:21.245 --> 31:25.082
would be so devastating
that you could target a planet

31:25.115 --> 31:28.119
and turn it into a pink mist,
floating through the cosmos,

31:28.152 --> 31:31.923
if you were
a hostile entity.

31:31.956 --> 31:36.694
<i> What I have discovered
in our contact with these civilizations,</i>

31:36.727 --> 31:40.531
<i> and we have had many
hundreds of contact experiences</i>

31:40.564 --> 31:44.402
<i> with our CE5 teams around
the world over the last 30 years,</i>

31:44.435 --> 31:46.270
<i> is that none of them
are hostile,</i>

31:46.303 --> 31:49.874
<i> but quite a few of them are
very concerned about our hostility,</i>

31:49.907 --> 31:52.877
and are doing things
to try to contain that.

31:52.910 --> 31:59.283
But our destiny beyond the Earth
is not only a matter of national identity

31:59.316 --> 32:02.453
but a matter of
national security.

32:02.486 --> 32:06.991
It is not enough to merely have
an American presence in space,

32:07.024 --> 32:11.829
we must have American
dominance in space.

32:11.862 --> 32:16.901
They want to project out into the stars,
their dominion.

32:16.934 --> 32:21.005
Our job is to get people to understand
that that is not what our mission is

32:21.038 --> 32:23.007
as a human species.

32:23.040 --> 32:27.111
We need to lay back, participate with
all other sentient life in the universe,

32:27.144 --> 32:30.348
and merit a proper position

32:30.381 --> 32:32.984
in the galactic federation.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.920
Not be the big bully
on the block.

32:35.953 --> 32:39.623
<i> Counterintelligence efforts
reach a new level of absurdity</i>

32:39.656 --> 32:43.260
<i> with the staging of host
events like cattle mutilations</i>

32:43.293 --> 32:44.896
<i> and alien abductions.</i>

32:46.830 --> 32:51.135
<i> In 2017, retired Air Force
intelligence officer</i>

32:51.168 --> 32:55.339
<i> Richard Doty made history
when he admitted on camera</i>

32:55.372 --> 32:58.342
<i> that unacknowledged
special access projects</i>

32:58.375 --> 33:01.979
<i> within the military,
do indeed</i>

33:02.012 --> 33:06.450
<i> stage alien abductions to lay
the psychological foundation</i>

33:06.483 --> 33:10.822
<i>for an inter planetary conflict
sometime in the near future.</i>

33:11.989 --> 33:14.291
We did do that, yes.

33:14.324 --> 33:15.993
OSI did that.

33:16.026 --> 33:21.899
There was a special group
out of the 7602nd intel wing

33:21.932 --> 33:25.136
at Fort Belvoir that
came out and did that.

33:25.169 --> 33:32.009
They had these people that
had maybe some sort of defects,

33:32.042 --> 33:37.982
anatomical defects
that were brought in

33:38.015 --> 33:41.752
to fool people into thinking
they were aliens.

33:41.785 --> 33:46.223
I can't give you any specifics
because the program is still classified.

33:46.256 --> 33:50.895
They're probably still doing it.
I wouldn't doubt they're still doing it.

33:50.928 --> 33:55.266
<i>This corroborates what dozens
of other insiders have disclosed</i>

33:55.299 --> 34:00.504
<i> to Dr. Greer, but they're too
afraid to testify on camera.</i>

34:00.537 --> 34:04.775
Colonel, you're about to find out
who your alien really is.

34:04.808 --> 34:06.577
General Stall?

34:06.610 --> 34:10.281
Some years ago, I had a meeting
with the crown prince of Liechtenstein,

34:10.313 --> 34:11.949
<i> Hans Adam Von Liechtenstein.</i>

34:11.982 --> 34:15.119
He had reached out to me
through some of his contacts.

34:15.152 --> 34:19.290
He said, "Look, Dr. Greer, we have to meet,
but we can't talk about this on the phone.

34:19.322 --> 34:23.793
"Your efforts to effect disclosure
are noble, but they will not

34:23.827 --> 34:25.728
"be able to be permitted.

34:25.762 --> 34:27.931
"And not for the reasons
you think."

34:27.965 --> 34:29.900
I said,
"Oh, this is interesting."

34:29.933 --> 34:33.637
<i> Finally, we got together
in New York City in July of 1994.</i>

34:33.670 --> 34:36.306
He said to me, "In 1989,

34:36.340 --> 34:39.810
"a group of us were trying
to do disclosure.

34:39.842 --> 34:43.813
<i> "And it involved Gorbachev,
President Bush, Senior, himself,</i>

34:43.847 --> 34:46.784
<i>"and the UN Secretary General,
Perez de Cuellar.</i>

34:46.817 --> 34:49.286
<i> "And in the course of us
putting together</i>

34:49.319 --> 34:53.157
<i> "the high-level planning meetings
to do this, Perez de Cuellar,</i>

34:53.190 --> 34:55.592
"the UN Secretary General
was abducted,

34:55.626 --> 34:58.262
<i> "out of his limousine
in Manhattan."</i>

34:58.295 --> 35:01.298
He was told by the "aliens"

35:01.331 --> 35:05.603
that if they did not cease and desist from
their plans to disclose this information,

35:05.636 --> 35:07.304
that every
world leader involved,

35:07.337 --> 35:10.341
including the President of the
United States, would be abducted.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.744
<i> This blew up like an atomic bomb
in the Bush White House,</i>

35:13.777 --> 35:15.913
and it did not go forward.

35:15.946 --> 35:17.681
I said,
"Okay, well, tell me more."

35:17.714 --> 35:23.120
He says, "Well, we've concluded
that we have to prepare the public

35:23.153 --> 35:25.256
"for an interplanetary war.

35:25.289 --> 35:30.494
"And in doing so, we can then also force
the return of Christ." I'm quoting.

35:30.527 --> 35:32.630
And I just listened.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.331
He didn't know
that I knew

35:34.364 --> 35:37.368
<i> that the means for that abduction
for Perez de Cuellar</i>

35:37.401 --> 35:39.970
<i> were run by
a counterintelligence unit</i>

35:40.003 --> 35:42.373
<i> out of the National
Security State,</i>

35:42.406 --> 35:47.545
that had the technologies
to simulate an alien craft and aliens,

35:47.578 --> 35:49.813
run completely
by military assets.

35:49.846 --> 35:52.016
And that there
was a deeper part

35:52.049 --> 35:54.285
of these unacknowledged
special access projects

35:54.318 --> 35:57.154
that were zooming
even people like Bush Senior,

35:57.187 --> 35:58.822
who was on the committee,

35:58.855 --> 36:01.692
but had lost control of some
of these renegade factions.

36:01.725 --> 36:03.561
It's a very complicated story.

36:03.594 --> 36:08.165
<i> Perez de Cuellar being abducted
caused them to stop that process.</i>

36:08.198 --> 36:13.304
It manipulated these leaders
into going onto a war footing.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.207
<i> And he confessed to me
that the reason he was funding</i>

36:16.240 --> 36:18.375
the work of
the abduction groups

36:18.408 --> 36:21.879
was because they wanted
to put information out to the public,

36:21.912 --> 36:23.681
<i> that would scare the public</i>

36:23.714 --> 36:27.318
so the people would make the sacrifice
in blood and treasure to have

36:27.351 --> 36:28.852
an interplanetary war.

36:28.885 --> 36:31.522
Now this is 25 years ago.

36:31.555 --> 36:33.524
It was not a happy
meeting for me.

36:33.557 --> 36:37.328
If there's any one thing
that is gonna mobilize people

36:37.361 --> 36:40.998
to allow the National Security State
to establish full-spectrum dominance

36:41.031 --> 36:43.334
over our planet,
it is this.

36:43.367 --> 36:47.271
<i> The beings themselves,
interestingly and very importantly,</i>

36:47.304 --> 36:50.074
<i> aren't putting out
their own story.</i>

36:50.107 --> 36:51.875
<i> They're not doing that yet.</i>

36:51.908 --> 36:54.245
<i> They're trying to
get us to understand it.</i>

36:54.278 --> 36:57.781
<i> They're trying to give us warnings
or help raise our consciousness,</i>

36:57.814 --> 37:00.784
<i> which is a critical part of
this entire operation going on.</i>

37:00.817 --> 37:03.287
And trying to get us
to do this for ourselves.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.422
That's what
this is all about.

37:05.455 --> 37:09.193
<i> But the National Security State
realizes that that's a slower process,</i>

37:09.226 --> 37:11.295
<i> so they're now trying to
hurry this up.</i>

37:11.328 --> 37:14.932
<i> There's kind of an emergency process
under way right now.</i>

37:14.965 --> 37:16.934
Make no mistake about that.

37:16.967 --> 37:20.871
When I was briefing the director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

37:20.904 --> 37:24.375
the very first thing he asked
wasn't about this subject.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.910
He looked at me,
he says, "Dr. Greer,

37:26.943 --> 37:31.081
"what we don't understand is why
you haven't killed yourself yet."

37:31.114 --> 37:35.486
He said, "Well, my dad knew about
some of this way back in the '60s.

37:35.519 --> 37:37.821
"No one would do
anything about it.

37:37.854 --> 37:41.725
"So he took his revolver and ate
his gun and blew his head off."

37:41.758 --> 37:43.827
Now this is
a three-star general

37:43.860 --> 37:47.564
telling me this story in the first ten
minutes we're together. I said, "Well,

37:47.597 --> 37:50.601
"I'm sorry that happened to you.

37:50.634 --> 37:53.604
"But I understand where your dad
was coming from."

37:53.637 --> 37:55.639
Because it's sort of this...

37:55.672 --> 37:57.007
Um...

38:01.445 --> 38:02.613
Anyway.

38:15.058 --> 38:16.394
Now, the truth is,

38:18.295 --> 38:21.332
there are lot of people
who've been on my team,

38:21.365 --> 38:23.867
who are military,
who have killed themselves.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.969
Others who have
been assassinated.

38:26.002 --> 38:29.206
So the other thing that keeps me up is,
you know...

38:34.177 --> 38:35.680
Survivor guilt.

38:46.757 --> 38:48.826
Sorry.

38:48.859 --> 38:50.527
<i> This National Security State</i>

38:50.560 --> 38:55.165
<i> is the bane of our human
existence right now.</i>

38:55.198 --> 38:59.370
<i> So we have to start disassembling
that National Security State.</i>

38:59.403 --> 39:05.709
Now, even say, Bernie Sanders,
hypothetically, were to become president.

39:05.742 --> 39:09.380
The National Security State isn't even
going to tell him where the washrooms are.

39:09.413 --> 39:13.050
That whole group is gonna
descend upon him

39:13.083 --> 39:16.520
and they're gonna give him at least
as much trouble as they've given Trump.

39:16.553 --> 39:19.156
If you got into the office

39:19.189 --> 39:22.659
and you found out
something about aliens,

39:22.692 --> 39:25.729
you found out something
about UFOs, would you let us know?

39:25.762 --> 39:28.999
Well, I'll tell you, my wife
would demand that I let you know.

39:29.032 --> 39:32.403
So that's why they want Joe Biden
and Kamala Harris to come in

39:32.436 --> 39:35.572
and kind of get things
"back to normal,"

39:35.605 --> 39:38.742
where the National Security State
is functioning. They're all operational.

39:38.775 --> 39:41.912
<i> They're all going to
brief Goldman Sachs.</i>

39:41.945 --> 39:44.948
<i> And they're putting people from Goldman
Sachs in charge of the economy.</i>

39:44.981 --> 39:46.617
That kind of thing.

39:46.650 --> 39:51.889
<i> We have to rise above
those kind of dialectical politics</i>

39:51.922 --> 39:55.526
<i> to bring the people up, raise
the consciousness of the people,</i>

39:55.559 --> 39:58.128
<i> and have this function
through democracy.</i>

39:58.161 --> 40:01.598
I mean, we've got the tools here.
They're in front of us.

40:01.631 --> 40:03.567
And we've got access
to the Internet, still.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.202
They haven't taken that
away from us yet.

40:05.235 --> 40:07.805
But there's
a short window here.

40:07.838 --> 40:12.242
<i>One exception to the almost universal
failure of world governments</i>

40:12.275 --> 40:16.547
<i>to initiate peaceful diplomacy
with ET civilizations</i>

40:16.580 --> 40:20.617
<i> took place in France,
in 2007.</i>

40:20.650 --> 40:24.488
<i> Then President Sarkozy's
Ministry of Defense reached out</i>

40:24.521 --> 40:28.225
<i> to Dr. Greer to train
its senior officials</i>

40:28.258 --> 40:32.062
<i> in the Close Encounters
of the Fifth Kind protocols.</i>

40:32.095 --> 40:35.265
<i> During a covert test run
in the French countryside,</i>

40:35.298 --> 40:41.972
<i> ET craft were tracked overhead
going 200,000 kilometers per hour.</i>

40:42.005 --> 40:44.241
<i> And this massive
mauve-colored craft</i>

40:44.274 --> 40:47.311
<i>partially materialized
a few meters from the group.</i>

40:51.548 --> 40:56.119
<i> Since the operation was swiftly halted
by National Security State interests,</i>

40:56.152 --> 41:00.924
<i> it remains the duty of we, the people,
to become peaceful ambassadors</i>

41:00.957 --> 41:02.926
<i> to the universe.</i>

41:02.959 --> 41:07.798
<i> Much like a denial of service cyber
attack can bottleneck and bring down</i>

41:07.831 --> 41:09.633
<i> a computer network,</i>

41:09.666 --> 41:14.471
<i> millions of people initiating contact
would completely overwhelm</i>

41:14.504 --> 41:19.977
<i> the National Security State's
ability to subvert disclosure.</i>

41:20.010 --> 41:24.014
The National Security State people,
potentially working with and through

41:24.047 --> 41:28.018
<i> the To The Stars Academy,
are going to be pitching this problem,</i>

41:28.051 --> 41:32.556
saying "Well, we can't just let
our whole civilization know

41:32.589 --> 41:36.527
<i> "that there's this highly advanced,
technologically superior</i>

41:36.560 --> 41:40.831
<i> "society out there and..."
Because our whole culture will collapse.</i>

41:40.864 --> 41:46.136
<i> Whereas, in fact, it's quite clear
that it's their defense of the elite,</i>

41:46.169 --> 41:48.739
<i> this 1% of the human family,</i>

41:48.772 --> 41:53.343
<i> that basically ends up controlling
over 40% of all the wealth on the planet,</i>

41:53.376 --> 41:55.412
<i> that they're
really defending.</i>

41:55.445 --> 41:58.048
It is their world that they're trying
to defend.

41:58.081 --> 42:02.052
<i> So that you see that this is a subset
of a larger question,</i>

42:02.085 --> 42:06.924
<i> about how spiritual consciousness
and the evolution of consciousness</i>

42:06.957 --> 42:11.895
<i>of understanding what we really are
in the makeup of the universe</i>

42:11.928 --> 42:15.265
is a threat in itself
to this elite.

42:15.298 --> 42:18.035
<i> Because that is
the dissolving away</i>

42:18.068 --> 42:20.604
<i> of these kind of differences
among ourselves,</i>

42:20.637 --> 42:23.840
<i> and this coming
into a full ownership</i>

42:23.873 --> 42:25.909
<i> of our proper place
in the universe</i>

42:25.942 --> 42:30.013
puts these people out of business
as the ruling elite.

42:30.046 --> 42:35.552
And so that the raising of consciousness
of our human family is so closely

42:35.585 --> 42:40.390
related on to the opening on to
the extraterrestrial experience,

42:40.423 --> 42:43.427
<i> that both of them together
are viewed as a threat</i>

42:43.460 --> 42:45.028
<i> by the elite.</i>

42:45.061 --> 42:47.531
What they're afraid of is that this
is such an accelerator

42:47.564 --> 42:51.268
<i> as people have these repeated
contacts with the extraterrestrials,</i>

42:51.301 --> 42:53.370
<i> their whole consciousness
starts to rise.</i>

42:53.403 --> 42:56.640
<i> They start becoming aware of the fact
that we're damaging our environment.</i>

42:56.673 --> 42:58.308
<i> They can become
aware of the fact</i>

42:58.341 --> 43:00.777
<i> that nuclear weapons are kind
of an insane thing to have.</i>

43:00.810 --> 43:02.879
<i> War is a really bad idea.</i>

43:02.912 --> 43:05.215
This is
a spiritual experience.

43:05.248 --> 43:08.885
It's a spiritual stimulation
that's coming.

43:08.918 --> 43:13.123
<i>If you take someone from Italy
and someone from Japan,</i>

43:13.156 --> 43:15.425
<i> very different cultures,
very different people,</i>

43:15.458 --> 43:17.661
<i> personalities, backgrounds,</i>

43:17.694 --> 43:21.164
and emotional temperament.
Now, extrapolate that out across

43:21.197 --> 43:25.068
the cosmos and think of the vast
differences there are going to be.

43:25.101 --> 43:26.670
How do we make
any sense of that

43:26.703 --> 43:29.239
if we aren't anchored
into something deeper?

43:29.272 --> 43:33.010
And that point of commonality
has been folded within each of us.

43:33.043 --> 43:35.679
And that is, we are awake,
conscious beings.

43:35.712 --> 43:37.648
They are awake,
we are awake.

43:37.681 --> 43:41.585
That faculty of being aware
of awareness, the consciousness,

43:41.618 --> 43:45.088
not what you're conscious of,
what it means to be awake,

43:45.121 --> 43:46.990
that is a singularity.

43:47.023 --> 43:49.826
And once we're anchored into
that state of consciousness,

43:49.859 --> 43:53.530
the unitive state,
then there aren't any aliens.

43:53.563 --> 43:56.133
There are just other people
who are a little different from us.

43:56.166 --> 44:00.304
This is the point where
we can make contact most easily.

44:21.991 --> 44:24.695
<i>When I looked at </i> Close Encounters
of the Third Kind, <i>I said,</i>

44:24.728 --> 44:28.198
"Well, somebody knows
what's going on here."

44:28.231 --> 44:32.969
<i> Because it had a lot to do with telepathy,
the sort of dreams people had</i>

44:33.002 --> 44:36.006
<i> that led them to the Devil's Tower
in Wyoming and all this.</i>

44:36.039 --> 44:39.309
And I then found out that Spielberg
had actually had a man,

44:39.342 --> 44:42.879
<i> J. Allen Hynek, who was
the head of Project Blue Book</i>

44:42.912 --> 44:45.515
<i> for the Air Force,
who was the chief consultant,</i>

44:45.548 --> 44:48.885
<i> who opened up files for him,
so he could make that movie</i>

44:48.918 --> 44:50.287
<i> almost like a docu-drama.</i>

44:53.923 --> 44:58.562
<i> In 2011, a CE5 group
at Joshua Tree National Park</i>

44:58.595 --> 45:03.934
<i> successfully contacted
an entire flotilla of ET craft.</i>

45:03.967 --> 45:06.603
<i> In the unprocessed
night vision footage,</i>

45:06.636 --> 45:09.573
<i> we see what appears
to be two distinct craft,</i>

45:09.606 --> 45:13.443
<i> but image enhancements reveal
that these are two parts</i>

45:13.476 --> 45:15.946
<i> of a super structure
or mother ship</i>

45:15.979 --> 45:20.050
<i> surrounded by an entire
fleet of ET vehicles.</i>

45:24.621 --> 45:26.423
<i> How is this possible?</i>

45:26.456 --> 45:30.861
<i> It is not possible
to simply crowbar extraterrestrials</i>

45:30.894 --> 45:35.732
<i> into our traditional,
relatively primitive view of reality.</i>

45:35.765 --> 45:37.768
<i> In order to make
sense of things,</i>

45:37.801 --> 45:41.071
<i> and indeed,
in order to make contact,</i>

45:41.104 --> 45:43.540
<i> we have to pause
and readdress</i>

45:43.573 --> 45:46.977
<i> our assumptions about
the very nature of reality.</i>

45:47.010 --> 45:50.947
<i>This is an essential reflection
which reveals that the mystery</i>

45:50.980 --> 45:54.618
<i> of extraterrestrials is but
a sign post that points to</i>

45:54.651 --> 45:57.988
<i> a far more profound
and intimate secret,</i>

45:58.021 --> 46:02.993
<i>one with the power to transform us
and the cosmos forever.</i>

46:03.026 --> 46:05.729
One day, I opened my mailbox
and I got out a little flyer,

46:05.762 --> 46:08.999
and it said, "We're inviting you
to a meeting with Ben Rich,

46:09.032 --> 46:11.568
<i> "the chairman and CEO
of Lockheed Skunk Works,</i>

46:11.601 --> 46:14.004
<i> "former UCLA alumni.</i>

46:14.037 --> 46:16.306
<i> "He'll be speaking to
the engineering alumni group</i>

46:16.339 --> 46:18.842
<i> "about his time at
the Skunk Works."</i>

46:18.875 --> 46:22.445
So, as he was finishing his talk
after about 45 minutes,

46:22.478 --> 46:25.816
his last slide was a black disc,
zipping off into outer space,

46:25.849 --> 46:27.684
and he ended
the talk by saying,

46:27.717 --> 46:30.854
"We now have the technology
to take ET home."

46:30.887 --> 46:32.856
And the whole room
burst out laughing.

46:32.889 --> 46:34.457
We said,
"Did he just say that?"

46:34.490 --> 46:36.960
And as he was walking away,
I followed him,

46:36.993 --> 46:39.596
and I said, "Ben, Ben." He turned
around and looked at me,

46:39.629 --> 46:43.200
and I said, "Ben, I'm really fascinated
with what you had to say today,"

46:43.233 --> 46:46.503
and I said, "I would really love to know
how we would do that.

46:46.536 --> 46:49.339
"What would we use
to get to the stars?"

46:49.372 --> 46:52.042
He looked at me, trying to figure out
who I was, I think,

46:52.075 --> 46:53.577
and he said,
"Let me ask you a question.

46:54.811 --> 46:56.479
"How does ESP work?"

46:56.512 --> 46:59.049
And I was really taken aback,
because I was asking a question,

46:59.082 --> 47:00.784
I wasn't expecting
to get a question back.

47:00.817 --> 47:02.552
So the first thing
that popped in my mind was,

47:02.585 --> 47:04.521
all points in space
and time are connected.

47:04.554 --> 47:05.789
So I fired that answer
back to him.

47:05.822 --> 47:07.657
"I don't know. All points in space
and time are connected."

47:07.690 --> 47:08.959
He said,
"That's how it works."

47:08.992 --> 47:10.627
He turned around
and he walked away.

47:10.660 --> 47:12.696
<i> This astonishing admission</i>

47:12.729 --> 47:15.565
<i> from a top military
industrial complex insider</i>

47:15.598 --> 47:19.369
<i> proves to be much more
than a simple analogy.</i>

47:19.402 --> 47:21.238
<i> The physics of UFOs,</i>

47:21.271 --> 47:24.808
<i> how they travel and communicate
through interstellar distances,</i>

47:24.841 --> 47:28.044
<i> how they generate power,
how they're manufactured</i>

47:28.077 --> 47:33.350
<i> is beyond the grasp of
unclassified mainstream science.</i>

47:33.383 --> 47:37.320
<i> Instead, a model of reality
that accounts for ESP</i>

47:37.353 --> 47:43.560
<i> is the only model in which we can
begin to comprehend ET technology.</i>

47:43.593 --> 47:46.062
If you're traveling
beyond the speed of light,

47:46.095 --> 47:49.733
<i> I call it the crossing point of light,
it's beyond the sound barrier.</i>

47:49.766 --> 47:52.269
<i> Well, there's something
beyond the light barrier.</i>

47:52.302 --> 47:55.205
<i> And you're going from, say,
the Andromeda Galaxy,</i>

47:55.238 --> 47:57.207
<i> that's two and a half million
light years away.</i>

47:57.240 --> 47:59.009
<i> So, at the speed of light,</i>

47:59.042 --> 48:01.011
<i> it would take two-and-a-half
million years for them to get here.</i>

48:01.044 --> 48:02.545
The speed of light's
too slow.

48:02.578 --> 48:05.282
<i> You cannot go from point
A to B through the cosmos</i>

48:05.315 --> 48:09.052
<i> through a linear system
of transportation.</i>

48:09.085 --> 48:13.857
Moreover, you cannot communicate
through those distances

48:13.890 --> 48:16.593
with something at the speed of light,
which is what your cellphone

48:16.626 --> 48:21.464
<i> and all these radio frequency
electromagnetic communication devices</i>

48:21.497 --> 48:23.633
<i> we use now on Earth
are using.</i>

48:23.666 --> 48:26.202
Any civilization
that is here,

48:26.235 --> 48:28.571
<i> that is interstellar,
by definition,</i>

48:28.604 --> 48:30.307
<i> is trans-dimensional.</i>

48:30.340 --> 48:32.943
<i> They're passing through
other dimensions</i>

48:32.976 --> 48:35.045
<i> and dropping out
of linearity</i>

48:35.078 --> 48:37.480
<i> going from A to B, boom,</i>

48:37.513 --> 48:40.917
<i> almost like a teleportation,
where it's that resonant effect</i>

48:40.950 --> 48:42.252
<i> from point A to B.</i>

48:44.120 --> 48:48.458
Any communications systems
that these ETs have

48:48.491 --> 48:53.396
are also going at the speed,
of not light, but of thought.

48:53.429 --> 48:55.398
Quanta of thought.

48:55.431 --> 49:00.170
We think of consciousness and thought
as this sort of amorphous, irrelevant,

49:00.203 --> 49:03.840
interesting but mystical thing.
But the central operating system

49:03.873 --> 49:07.744
and communication system
for all interstellar civilizations

49:07.777 --> 49:09.512
is consciousness
and thought,

49:09.545 --> 49:13.416
<i> and technologies that
interface with them.</i>

49:13.449 --> 49:20.023
<i> God, prana,
chi, magic, consciousness.</i>

49:20.056 --> 49:22.425
<i> Every culture
throughout history</i>

49:22.458 --> 49:25.929
<i> has had a word to describe
this intangible energy</i>

49:25.962 --> 49:28.031
<i> that connects everyone
and everything.</i>

49:29.632 --> 49:32.168
<i> Decades of laboratory studies</i>

49:32.201 --> 49:35.472
<i> show that our minds have
a mysterious ordering effect</i>

49:35.505 --> 49:37.841
<i> on quantum-level
phenomena.</i>

49:37.874 --> 49:40.643
<i> Despite overwhelming
scientific evidence,</i>

49:40.676 --> 49:43.646
<i> most people would still
be shocked to learn</i>

49:43.679 --> 49:47.884
<i> that certain scientists
have known that the force is real</i>

49:47.917 --> 49:49.986
<i> for a very long time.</i>

49:50.019 --> 49:51.888
One of the people
that I met

49:51.921 --> 49:55.125
in the course of doing this work
was astronaut Edgar Mitchell,

49:55.158 --> 49:57.660
<i> who was the sixth man
to walk on the Moon.</i>

49:57.693 --> 49:59.996
We had sightings
of all sorts.

50:00.029 --> 50:03.199
<i> There seems to have been
a great deal of secrecy</i>

50:03.232 --> 50:06.236
<i> surrounding the so-called
UFO event.</i>

50:06.269 --> 50:08.471
<i>He had an experience in space,</i>

50:08.504 --> 50:10.807
<i> an expanded
state of consciousness</i>

50:10.840 --> 50:13.009
that led him to form

50:13.042 --> 50:15.178
<i> the Institute of
Noetic Sciences,</i>

50:15.211 --> 50:17.347
<i> to study
the science of consciousness.</i>

50:17.380 --> 50:21.851
I also brought him
to the briefing I did in 1997,

50:21.884 --> 50:24.754
<i> with the head of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,</i>

50:24.787 --> 50:28.358
<i> Admiral Tom Wilson.
The data on that has since leaked out.</i>

50:28.391 --> 50:31.995
<i> Edgar Mitchell realized there was
this connection between space</i>

50:32.028 --> 50:34.831
<i> and these
extraterrestrial lifeforms</i>

50:34.864 --> 50:38.234
<i> in the science of consciousness
that was very integral to the study.</i>

50:38.267 --> 50:42.672
Most of the people that I had
met with in senior science,

50:42.705 --> 50:46.342
<i> NASA, aerospace and
intelligence community figures,</i>

50:46.375 --> 50:49.045
know that the key
missing ingredient

50:49.078 --> 50:53.183
to most people's understanding
of the whole UFO phenomenon

50:53.216 --> 50:55.085
is the science
of consciousness.

50:55.118 --> 50:59.389
The ETs are trying to encourage people
to understand higher consciousness

50:59.422 --> 51:04.527
and the universal mind, to be able
to have a relationship with them,

51:04.560 --> 51:07.263
<i> but that's going forward
into the future.</i>

51:07.296 --> 51:09.933
<i> And Edgar Mitchell
realized that quite early on</i>

51:09.966 --> 51:12.068
<i> because of his own personal
experience out in space,</i>

51:12.101 --> 51:14.404
<i> as the sixth man
to walk on the Moon.</i>

51:14.437 --> 51:16.539
What's the nature
of the universe we live in?

51:16.572 --> 51:19.909
What is our relationship
to the larger reality?

51:19.942 --> 51:23.280
<i> If that's a part of the larger reality,
and we're denying it,</i>

51:25.014 --> 51:26.483
<i> that, to me,
is unconscionable.</i>

51:55.378 --> 51:58.181
We've thought for a long time
that the closer we could look

51:58.214 --> 52:01.317
<i> at the operations of cells
in our body and in our brains,</i>

52:01.350 --> 52:04.654
<i> the closer we'd come
to finding the location of consciousness.</i>

52:04.687 --> 52:08.191
<i> While there's been fantastic work
at mapping neural connections</i>

52:08.224 --> 52:10.527
<i>and understanding more and more
about the brain and memory,</i>

52:10.560 --> 52:14.664
what we find is that we still
don't know where "consciousness" is.

52:14.697 --> 52:17.767
<i> Adam Michael Curry is an inventor
and entrepreneur</i>

52:17.800 --> 52:20.203
<i> whose groundbreaking
work as a teenager</i>

52:20.236 --> 52:24.541
<i> caught the eye of Princeton's Dean
of Engineering, Dr. Robert Jahn.</i>

52:24.574 --> 52:29.779
<i> Dr. Jahn recruited Adam into the Princeton
engineering anomalies research lab</i>

52:29.812 --> 52:33.283
<i> where they studied the mysterious
ordering effect of consciousness</i>

52:33.316 --> 52:34.984
<i> on quantum systems,</i>

52:35.017 --> 52:40.056
<i> an effect they called
mind-matter interaction.</i>

52:40.089 --> 52:43.159
A non-localized picture
is the picture of consciousness

52:43.192 --> 52:44.894
on which we're
converging now.

52:44.927 --> 52:48.398
Which is to say that consciousness
does not seem to be

52:48.431 --> 52:51.734
strictly produced by the brain.
It involves the brain,

52:51.767 --> 52:54.204
but there's something much
deeper going on here.

52:54.237 --> 52:57.373
<i> Consciousness may not
be localized to our bodies,</i>

52:57.406 --> 53:01.711
<i> but may be a fundamental feature
of the physical world in which we live.</i>

53:14.757 --> 53:19.729
Consciousness, this faculty
of being sentient, awake,

53:19.762 --> 53:22.832
is not limited to our
brainwaves or our bodies,

53:22.865 --> 53:26.236
but in fact, transcends
the limits of spacetime,

53:26.269 --> 53:28.938
<i> as it unbounded field
of awareness.</i>

53:28.971 --> 53:32.208
And that is true whether you
recognize it or not.

53:32.241 --> 53:35.378
Interestingly, it doesn't matter
if you intellectualize it.

53:35.411 --> 53:39.249
That is the reality of it that has
been proven through scientific studies,

53:39.282 --> 53:43.052
such as Dr. Jahn's work at Princeton,
where they would have people

53:43.085 --> 53:45.255
<i> put their awareness on
a random number generator</i>

53:45.288 --> 53:48.458
<i> that's spitting out zeros
and ones, randomly,</i>

53:48.491 --> 53:52.028
and would intend to shift it,
say, towards zeros, and it would shift,

53:52.061 --> 53:54.931
without any linear wires,
just their thought.

53:54.964 --> 53:57.200
Essentially what a random number
generator does,

53:57.233 --> 54:00.270
is it looks at something intrinsically
random in the physical world,

54:00.303 --> 54:03.439
<i> typically a quantum process,
and it converts those into a string</i>

54:03.472 --> 54:05.642
<i> of ones and zeros.</i>

54:05.675 --> 54:09.612
<i> So you can think of it like a coin flipper
where heads is one and tails is zero.</i>

54:09.645 --> 54:12.548
<i> Now, if you collected a large
enough sample size, you'll find</i>

54:12.581 --> 54:15.618
<i> a 50-50 distribution
of these ones and zeros.</i>

54:15.651 --> 54:18.921
Meaning, physical reality is behaving
the way it should.

54:18.954 --> 54:23.760
<i> If you get somebody in front of a machine
and you ask them to use their intention</i>

54:23.793 --> 54:27.063
<i> to mean shift the thing
to more ones or more zeros,</i>

54:27.096 --> 54:29.966
<i>what you find is that there's,
not all the time, but often,</i>

54:29.999 --> 54:33.236
<i> a significant mean shift
in the direction of their intention.</i>

54:33.269 --> 54:35.805
<i> Now, that's a very
simple experiment,</i>

54:35.838 --> 54:38.574
but the implications
are absolutely profound.

54:38.607 --> 54:43.479
That suggests that, in fact, consciousness
does not seem to be just an illusion

54:43.512 --> 54:46.649
or just
a localized phenomenon,

54:46.682 --> 54:50.153
but that it does have some sort
of capabilities to affect

54:50.186 --> 54:54.857
the probabilities at the deepest layer
of reality down in the basement layer

54:54.890 --> 54:56.293
of the quantum world, somehow.

55:12.842 --> 55:14.977
The best way to
understand nonlocality

55:15.010 --> 55:19.182
is to understand that, in both
physics and in consciousness,

55:19.215 --> 55:24.220
there is a connection that exists
amongst all things,

55:24.253 --> 55:27.323
<i> from photons, to people,
to awareness,</i>

55:27.356 --> 55:31.728
that isn't limited
by space and time per se.

55:31.761 --> 55:33.629
That are woven
within each other.

55:33.662 --> 55:36.065
<i> Dr. Emoto,
the Japanese scientist,</i>

55:36.098 --> 55:41.571
began to experiment with water and people
putting their intent on the water.

55:41.604 --> 55:43.806
<i> And he did photography
that would show</i>

55:43.839 --> 55:46.309
<i> these different
crystalline structures.</i>

55:46.342 --> 55:48.678
<i> If it was
a very negative emotion,</i>

55:48.711 --> 55:51.247
<i> the crystals would be
all dissonant,</i>

55:51.280 --> 55:54.817
<i> but when it was
highly-ordered conscious or love,</i>

55:54.850 --> 55:57.353
<i> the structures were
these beautiful</i>

55:57.386 --> 55:59.989
<i> ordered structures
that he would photograph.</i>

56:00.022 --> 56:02.392
<i> And this was repeated
by other scientists.</i>

56:02.425 --> 56:05.194
<i> Water has
a crystalline component.</i>

56:05.227 --> 56:09.866
<i> But it's also tied into, like all matter
in space and time in the universe,</i>

56:09.899 --> 56:12.101
<i> to this consciousness
force field.</i>

56:12.134 --> 56:16.506
<i> If you enter into just a quiet state
of consciousness and intend</i>

56:16.539 --> 56:20.076
something very positive,
it literally altered the structure

56:20.109 --> 56:21.611
of the water itself.

56:21.644 --> 56:25.548
Nonlocality is au courant
with modern physics.

56:25.581 --> 56:32.021
Schrodinger talked about nonlocality
and entanglement in the 1920s,

56:32.054 --> 56:36.392
but it really wasn't
until 1970

56:36.425 --> 56:42.198
<i> that Freedman and Clauser
at Berkeley discovered that photons</i>

56:42.231 --> 56:45.635
<i> born together,
like identical twins,</i>

56:45.668 --> 56:48.971
<i> can move off into the distance
from one another</i>

56:49.004 --> 56:53.609
<i> and you grab one twin and you change
the polarization of the other,</i>

56:53.642 --> 56:56.712
<i> even though they're
very, very far apart.</i>

56:56.745 --> 57:00.416
And the lingo, describing this
in modern physics,

57:00.449 --> 57:03.886
as we would say, they're entangled
with one another.

57:03.919 --> 57:07.890
There was an unpublished experiment
that we did at the para lab

57:07.923 --> 57:09.759
which we called
Plant R and G.

57:09.792 --> 57:13.629
<i>You have a room with no windows
and you have a house plant</i>

57:13.662 --> 57:15.465
<i> that needs light to grow.</i>

57:15.498 --> 57:18.568
<i> And you have a single growing light,
up on the roof.</i>

57:18.601 --> 57:21.904
<i> The growing light can turn
in one of four quadrants,</i>

57:21.937 --> 57:25.908
<i> and which quadrant that light is showing
is controlled by a random number generator.</i>

57:25.941 --> 57:28.778
<i> So you put the plant
in one corner of the room.</i>

57:28.811 --> 57:32.782
<i> The light has an equal chance
of shining in all four quadrants.</i>

57:32.815 --> 57:35.151
<i> But you give it enough time,
what you find is the light</i>

57:35.184 --> 57:37.587
<i> actually shines far more
often on the plant</i>

57:37.620 --> 57:39.355
<i> than on
the other coordinates.</i>

57:39.388 --> 57:44.126
<i> It's as though life itself,
even life or consciousness in it,</i>

57:44.159 --> 57:45.795
<i> in something as simple
as a house plant,</i>

57:45.828 --> 57:48.097
<i> bends probabilities
in the physical world</i>

57:48.130 --> 57:51.000
<i> in the direction of what it needs,
in the direction of its growth</i>

57:51.033 --> 57:52.468
<i> and its evolution.</i>

57:52.501 --> 57:55.505
I see that experiment as profound
because it shows to me

57:55.538 --> 57:57.707
what consciousness
does in the world.

57:57.740 --> 58:01.811
How could ESP work?
Does ESP violate any physics?

58:01.844 --> 58:04.480
First of all, you can't violate
the laws of physics.

58:04.513 --> 58:06.249
<i> It's not like going through
a stop sign.</i>

58:07.049 --> 58:09.151
If you have a phenomenon,

58:09.184 --> 58:12.522
physics has to change to agree
with your phenomena.

58:12.555 --> 58:17.627
The biggest interest
in classified intelligence projects

58:17.660 --> 58:20.162
has to do with the science
of consciousness,

58:20.195 --> 58:24.333
because even during the Cold War,
before World War II,

58:24.366 --> 58:27.703
<i> they realized that there were people
on the other side</i>

58:27.736 --> 58:31.908
of some of those conflicts that were very
adept at what's now called remote viewing,

58:31.941 --> 58:36.212
<i> the ability to use consciousness
to spy on a remote place.</i>

58:36.245 --> 58:39.982
These programs began
to be studied, scientifically,

58:40.015 --> 58:42.985
and then routinized,
made routine,

58:43.018 --> 58:47.056
in the intelligence community
back in '40s, '50s, '60s.

58:47.089 --> 58:51.093
You can say my spiritual development
was paid for by the CIA,

58:51.126 --> 58:53.529
which is
a very unusual situation.

58:53.562 --> 58:57.099
<i> In 1972, Dr. Russell Targ,
a laser physicist</i>

58:57.132 --> 58:59.435
<i> at the Lockheed
Missile and Space Company,</i>

58:59.468 --> 59:03.606
<i> joined the Stanford Research
Institute to begin a CIA-funded</i>

59:03.639 --> 59:07.610
<i> psychic espionage program,
using remote viewing</i>

59:07.643 --> 59:10.446
<i> to gather intelligence
on distant targets.</i>

59:11.480 --> 59:14.083
We had a 20-year program
at Stanford,

59:15.084 --> 59:18.220
in which we worked
with the CIA

59:18.253 --> 59:21.857
<i>to describe what the Russians,
what the Chinese were doing.</i>

59:21.890 --> 59:24.427
<i> And we were forecasting
on a Monday</i>

59:24.460 --> 59:28.698
whether the market would go up
or down the following Friday.

59:28.731 --> 59:33.803
<i> And we made nine forecasts like that,
nine weeks in a row,</i>

59:33.836 --> 59:35.771
<i> and they were all correct.</i>

59:35.804 --> 59:40.776
We made $120,000, and we were on the
front page of <i> The Wall Street Journal.</i>

59:40.809 --> 59:44.447
So, back in 1982,

59:44.480 --> 59:48.484
when we were making money
on Wall Street, ESP was real.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.807
We didn't invent
remote viewing.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.144
It was known
since Biblical times.

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:20.916
<i> The Buddha spoke in very great detail
about how to quiet your mind,</i>

01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:22.485
<i> look into the future.</i>

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:25.321
<i> And if you're
an accomplished meditator,</i>

01:00:25.354 --> 01:00:29.525
<i> you were expected to be
able to see into the distance,</i>

01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:30.993
<i> see into the future,</i>

01:00:31.026 --> 01:00:34.964
heal the sick
and diagnose illnesses.

01:00:34.997 --> 01:00:38.934
And various times
during the next millennia,

01:00:38.967 --> 01:00:40.603
people would discover

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:43.706
that, yes, indeed,
you can look into the future,

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:45.641
you can look
into the distance.

01:00:45.674 --> 01:00:50.780
And, our operation,
from 1972 to 1995,

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:54.150
23 years,
our venture into this

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:57.853
<i> was a rediscovery
or recapitulation</i>

01:00:57.886 --> 01:01:01.023
<i> of what people
had known and forgotten</i>

01:01:01.056 --> 01:01:04.126
<i>during the previous millennia.</i>

01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:08.531
<i> Religious traditions and the emerging
scientific paradigm</i>

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:13.335
<i> are converging on this personal
experience of universal consciousness.</i>

01:01:13.368 --> 01:01:16.205
<i> Dr. Greer first glimpsed
this reality</i>

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:20.142
<i>during a near-death experience
when he was only 17 years old.</i>

01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:23.679
You know, if you've died
and you know there is no death,

01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:25.681
then you have
no fear of it.

01:01:25.714 --> 01:01:28.651
And until you have no fear of death,
you really can't live.

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:32.354
I realize that the consciousness
whereby I was awake,

01:01:32.387 --> 01:01:34.557
that drop of
my individual awareness

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:39.061
<i> could merge with the ocean
of unbounded cosmic mind.</i>

01:01:39.094 --> 01:01:43.599
So that experience taught me
that there's nothing to be afraid of

01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:46.168
and there's nowhere to go
'cause you're already there.

01:01:46.201 --> 01:01:49.205
You just have to open
to what's already there within you.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:53.409
This liberated me in a way
that I can't even imagine.

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:56.011
It is true liberation.

01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:58.948
Now, you don't have to drop dead
like I did to have that happen.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.516
I think you can
experience that

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:03.185
through this deeper experience
in meditation.

01:02:03.218 --> 01:02:06.856
And that's why, after I had that
near-death experience,

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.092
I thought, "How do I get back to there
without being deathly ill?"

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:12.728
<i> And so I began to learn
how to do meditation,</i>

01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:14.430
<i> 'cause the whole universe
is actually</i>

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:16.932
<i> folded within every
single conscious being.</i>

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:19.268
<i> It's like
a quantum hologram.</i>

01:02:19.301 --> 01:02:20.603
<i> But if you look at it,</i>

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:24.039
<i> every single sentient being
in the cosmos</i>

01:02:24.072 --> 01:02:25.875
<i> has folded
within the structure</i>

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:30.312
of their consciousness,
the entirety of the cosmos.

01:02:30.345 --> 01:02:31.814
Everything.

01:02:31.847 --> 01:02:34.950
Which is why within these deep,
quiet meditative states

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:36.619
<i> you can obtain knowledge,</i>

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:40.055
<i> see places, know things,
communicate,</i>

01:02:40.088 --> 01:02:43.058
<i> because in reality,
it's always there.</i>

01:02:43.091 --> 01:02:46.829
<i> You just have to get into a quiet state
of consciousness where it opens to you.</i>

01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:03.479
And so I began to be a student
of the ancient Vedas.

01:03:03.512 --> 01:03:05.247
<i> What I learned was</i>

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.685
<i> that they had a really excellent
articulation, explanation</i>

01:03:09.718 --> 01:03:13.122
<i> of consciousness,
the science of consciousness,</i>

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:17.193
higher states of consciousness,
and their effect.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:21.831
Now, their effect were known
as <i>siddhis,</i> S-I-D-D-H-I-S.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:25.534
For example,
the ability to levitate

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:29.638
<i> or teleport, dematerialize,
rematerialize,</i>

01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:32.041
<i> bilocate, trilocate,</i>

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.043
go through solid objects.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:37.646
These were all things
that develop spontaneously

01:03:37.679 --> 01:03:41.183
<i> as you enter into deeper and deeper
and higher states of consciousness,</i>

01:03:41.216 --> 01:03:43.452
<i> precognition, telepathy.</i>

01:03:43.485 --> 01:03:47.189
<i> These were not considered
exotic phenomena.</i>

01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:51.560
<i> These were considered
abilities that were available</i>

01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:53.562
<i> to the experienced meditators</i>

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:57.700
as part of quieting your mind,
part of the practice.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.902
And it's all available.

01:03:59.935 --> 01:04:03.706
We have to participate
in consciously evolving

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.975
these faculties that we have

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:10.246
that can directly experience
dimensions of reality

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:15.651
that, at the present time, are beyond
our direct, immediate sensorial system.

01:04:15.684 --> 01:04:18.554
That's what we're engaged in.
That's what this is all about.

01:04:18.587 --> 01:04:19.989
<i> And that's
what these beings are.</i>

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:22.691
<i> These beings, obviously,
probably come from like,</i>

01:04:22.724 --> 01:04:25.094
<i> a red dwarf star,
some of them,</i>

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:28.197
<i> where they've been around
10 billion years longer than we have.</i>

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:30.833
<i> So they've evolved these
other faculties</i>

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:35.204
<i>in addition to being able to see and touch and
taste and do the things they do, you know.</i>

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:38.607
And so people are saying,
"What is our relationship to these beings?"

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.211
<i> Why is it that they even look
as much as they do like us</i>

01:04:42.244 --> 01:04:44.013
<i> or why we look like them?</i>

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:47.549
<i> These are all profoundly
important questions of our relationship</i>

01:04:47.582 --> 01:04:50.519
<i> with other sentient life
in the universe</i>

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:53.555
<i> and to understand our place
in the order of things.</i>

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:57.059
<i>When you accept what this science
is showing us,</i>

01:04:57.092 --> 01:04:58.627
<i> that we are all connected,</i>

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.729
<i> and you then say,
"Well, hold on a second.</i>

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:03.399
<i> "If we're not just connected
with human beings,</i>

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:05.801
<i> "but we're also connected
with the plant life,</i>

01:05:05.834 --> 01:05:09.104
<i> "with the planet itself,
with the entire animal kingdom,</i>

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:12.775
<i> "and you begin to develop that deeper
sense of empathy with all that,</i>

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:15.644
<i> "who's to say that
that interconnectedness</i>

01:05:15.677 --> 01:05:19.782
<i> "doesn't extend to all the other
planets, to the cosmos?</i>

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:22.151
<i> "If we share that
with extraterrestrials,</i>

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.786
"what does that world
look like?"

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:26.622
If consciousness and thought

01:05:26.655 --> 01:05:29.959
can affect something at a distance
and at a very great distance,

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:33.762
even many miles or thousands
of miles away, instantaneously,

01:05:33.795 --> 01:05:37.633
what does that mean for us
communicating with this civilization

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.669
that is centered
in the science of consciousness?

01:05:40.702 --> 01:05:44.740
<i> And that is their chief operating system,
it's not electromagnetic.</i>

01:05:44.773 --> 01:05:47.409
<i> They use it,
but it's beyond that.</i>

01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:49.778
<i> So, now, add to everything
we know about the Internet</i>

01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:51.780
<i> and communications
and telecom</i>

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:55.451
<i> and then add a deeper level
of transdimensional physics</i>

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:58.253
<i> that involve
electronic devices</i>

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:01.924
<i> very clearly picking up
intended, coherent thought.</i>

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.425
That's what
you're dealing with.

01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:07.629
It's like Dr. Jahn's random
number generator experiment

01:06:07.662 --> 01:06:09.264
on a cosmic scale,

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:12.768
but at a level of perfection
where there is precision

01:06:12.801 --> 01:06:15.337
with the thought that
you project to it,

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.706
its reception
and then its activity.

01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:23.379
<i>Interstellar civilizations are using
consciousness-assisting technologies</i>

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.881
<i> and technologies that assist
their own consciousness,</i>

01:06:25.914 --> 01:06:30.152
<i> both, in all their travel
and communication systems.</i>

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:32.187
The central operating system

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.724
for any interstellar
competent civilization

01:06:35.757 --> 01:06:37.993
is the science
of consciousness

01:06:38.026 --> 01:06:40.295
and all the physics
that go with that.

01:06:40.328 --> 01:06:43.899
<i> We can see an early example
of consciousness technology</i>

01:06:43.932 --> 01:06:47.503
<i> in the Mind Lamp
developed by Psyleron.</i>

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:50.906
<i> This prototype integrates
a random number generator</i>

01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:52.875
<i> into a color-changing light.</i>

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.878
<i> Think of a color and the lamp
turns that color.</i>

01:07:00.782 --> 01:07:02.751
Oh, that's what
I actually was doing.

01:07:02.784 --> 01:07:04.586
First, I was doing sunset.

01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:06.188
Oh, cool.

01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:08.690
<i> This basic interface
between mind and machine</i>

01:07:08.723 --> 01:07:10.993
<i> points to
a deep interconnection</i>

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:15.664
<i> between all things that science
is only beginning to recognize.</i>

01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:17.399
<i> It's the means for us</i>

01:07:17.432 --> 01:07:20.602
<i> as a civilization to be anchored
in something more profound</i>

01:07:20.635 --> 01:07:24.940
<i> than the superficial aspects
of being, say, human.</i>

01:07:24.973 --> 01:07:26.442
Because humanism isn't enough

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.911
because we're dealing with
non-human life forms.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:31.914
Now we have to transcend
even humanism

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:35.617
and our common humanity
into this idea

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:39.755
that there has to be something
more universal within us

01:07:39.788 --> 01:07:42.524
that's also within these
extraterrestrial civilizations

01:07:42.557 --> 01:07:44.259
that bind us together.

01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:45.928
And luckily, there is.

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:50.365
It's this field of consciousness
that is cosmic and universal.

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:52.534
And that's what's
inside everyone.

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:56.038
Doesn't matter if it's a homeless
person on the street,

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.573
or an MIT professor.

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.374
If they are conscious
and awake,

01:07:59.407 --> 01:08:01.643
the entirety of the cosmos

01:08:01.676 --> 01:08:05.280
is folded within them like a
conscious quantum hologram.

01:08:05.313 --> 01:08:08.584
Because consciousness isn't
limited by space and time.

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:10.486
People say,
"Where do I have to go?"

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.387
Well, first, you have to
go within yourself.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.623
But you have to understand
what "yourself" is.

01:08:14.656 --> 01:08:17.059
And there's your
individual ego in self.

01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:19.328
But there's this deeper aspect
of ourselves

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:22.296
that is
simultaneously interwoven.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:25.767
And when we go deep in meditation
and connect to that,

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.237
then we have reached the point
that we can be

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.104
an ambassador
to the universe,

01:08:30.138 --> 01:08:33.108
because we have
become universal.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:59.667
Once this question mark
is introduced into your brain,

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:01.937
you start
searching out answers.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.640
It was like, kinda the Dreyfuss character
in <i>Close Encounters.</i>

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:08.511
<i> You wanna know
what's really behind the screen.</i>

01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:11.947
And because
we're not being told this

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:13.782
and, you know,

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:16.852
we do have the ability to change life
for the better on this planet,

01:09:16.885 --> 01:09:20.455
but we're being suppressed
and we're being stopped from doing it

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.823
for a variety of reasons,

01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:25.761
most of which are
greed-motivated.

01:09:26.928 --> 01:09:28.997
So, we went out to Oracle

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:31.466
and, sure enough, I mean,
we did these protocols

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:33.135
and we got into meditation,

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:35.636
which is something
I wanna learn about more.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.506
And, you know,
things started to appear.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.590
Well, oh, no.

01:09:57.859 --> 01:09:59.161
Oh, and it's fading out.

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.762
-Yeah, it just went away.
-It just faded out.

01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:27.256
-Oh, it's back. Yeah.
-It's back.

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.457
Right here.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.092
It just went out again.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:59.254
The steps of this are that you sit
in quiet consciousness.

01:10:59.287 --> 01:11:02.557
And you don't have to have
a full-on <i> samadhi</i> or whatever,

01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:04.293
but just in
quiet consciousness,

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:06.995
connect to that aspect
of your mind

01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:09.831
that is... unbounded.

01:11:09.864 --> 01:11:13.235
And then intend
to sense, feel, see,

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.437
know where
the ET craft is.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.306
It could be
in another galaxy.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:19.841
Connect to those beings,

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:23.445
politely invite them
to come and visit you.

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:26.748
And then you connect
to their communication systems

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:28.750
and their consciousness,
which are integrated,

01:11:28.783 --> 01:11:30.819
and you show them
where you are.

01:11:30.852 --> 01:11:32.754
So you kinda zoom in.

01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:34.823
<i> It's almost
like a vectoring,</i>

01:11:34.856 --> 01:11:37.459
<i> a zooming in from
wherever they are</i>

01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:41.096
<i> to where you are. Let's say,
if you're in North Carolina,</i>

01:11:41.129 --> 01:11:43.165
<i> you're coming in to Earth,</i>

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:46.702
<i> you're coming in to North America,
the East Coast,</i>

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:50.872
the mountains, the Blue Ridge,
zoom down to a few square meters

01:11:50.905 --> 01:11:54.009
around where you are, where you
clearly show them where you are.

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:57.045
And you do this in a coherent
thought sequence

01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:58.480
that is continuous.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.517
-Look at that!
-I got it.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:03.585
Oh, my gosh.

01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:05.721
Oh.

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:09.191
What the hell?

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:12.461
It's very easy to do once
you practice it for a while.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:17.199
The key thing is to first take
about half an hour to meditate,

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:20.535
go into quiet mind,
then sense where they are

01:12:20.568 --> 01:12:21.870
and then invite them.

01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:23.305
<i> People say we were calling them.
I said,</i>

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.840
<i> "Wait, no.
It's not like that."</i>

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:28.143
<i>You're actually making contact
in consciousness and thought</i>

01:12:28.176 --> 01:12:30.579
<i> before they arrive
in their craft</i>

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:32.981
<i> or transdimensionally
around you.</i>

01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:36.351
<i> And when the ETs
approach us most profoundly,</i>

01:12:36.384 --> 01:12:40.589
<i>it's when everyone in the team is
in a coherent state of consciousness</i>

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.225
<i> and are clearly doing this
with the intent.</i>

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:45.427
This cohesion
with the group,

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:48.830
this meditation being part
of making contact,

01:12:48.863 --> 01:12:50.098
which I had no idea.

01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.601
Even though I'm looking at
your YouTube videos,

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.503
that component
didn't resonate.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.905
It was my scientific brain saying,

01:12:56.938 --> 01:12:58.440
"I wanna go look at UFOs."

01:12:58.473 --> 01:13:01.376
What happens in these groups
is a coherence between a bond

01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:04.546
between the group. And when there's
a love and a connection there,

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:07.849
it enhances the part
of making contact

01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:09.217
<i> because we're together,
we're one.</i>

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:12.454
There's like a fine love there
between all of us.

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:15.590
The second or third night
we had the twin ships come,

01:13:15.623 --> 01:13:17.926
<i> you know, from Atlantic Ocean
at 9:00, 10:00 at night.</i>

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:20.529
<i> Then all of a sudden
this ship comes in,</i>

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.764
<i> and it's like
the size of the sun,</i>

01:13:22.797 --> 01:13:24.366
and it's pulsing.

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:27.235
<i> And Dr. Greer... you'd signal it
with your laser</i>

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:30.806
<i> and then a second one manifests,
and they're both pulsing.</i>

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.408
<i> At that point,
my hair is standing up,</i>

01:13:33.441 --> 01:13:35.610
<i> I have the chills.
I'm going,</i>

01:13:35.643 --> 01:13:37.446
<i> "This is amazing!"
I'm like...</i>

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.082
To actually witness
something firsthand

01:13:41.115 --> 01:13:44.453
as opposed to seeing
in television or seeing photographs,

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.054
it's mind-blowing.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:49.391
<i> For me, it was so profound,
I couldn't sleep that night.</i>

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:52.427
<i> I was just amazed,
but the amazement was that,</i>

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.895
<i> not that I saw it,</i>

01:13:53.928 --> 01:13:56.998
and actually I needed that
because I have that mindset.

01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.433
But the feeling you got...

01:13:58.466 --> 01:14:00.335
<i>I got this incredible feeling.</i>

01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:03.238
<i> You had these two ships
and then...</i>

01:14:03.271 --> 01:14:04.573
<i> I can't explain it. My...</i>

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.942
<i> It's just
an emotional state.</i>

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:09.144
<i> I was so taken by it.</i>

01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:12.314
<i> Once you see something,
you can't unsee it.</i>

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:16.284
It sort of shattered
my small view of the world

01:14:16.317 --> 01:14:18.687
and I became aware.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.423
Running the protocols
and making this kind of contact

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:24.426
has really helped me
move up a notch, spiritually.

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.861
<i> I really feel that</i>

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:28.797
<i> it's helped me to really
see the oneness in all things.</i>

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:31.266
<i> When you're sitting
under a blanket of stars,</i>

01:14:31.299 --> 01:14:33.101
<i> you're really part of it.
I mean, it's...</i>

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:38.273
You feel you're a little drop
in that huge ocean.

01:14:38.306 --> 01:14:40.475
Sorry, it's emotional.

01:14:40.508 --> 01:14:42.010
You have to experience it,

01:14:42.043 --> 01:14:45.047
but I wish for everybody
to have that opportunity.

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:56.858
When I first started out,
it was shocking.

01:14:56.891 --> 01:14:59.528
The first few orbs I saw,
the phenomena I saw

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.663
changed my
entire paradigm.

01:15:01.696 --> 01:15:05.033
<i> The first sighting was an incredible
triangle formation</i>

01:15:05.066 --> 01:15:07.903
<i> of three golden spheres
over my apartment</i>

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.471
<i> in Newport Beach, California.</i>

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.039
I ran outside

01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:14.376
and saw this formation right
above my house at close range

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.645
<i> and I managed
to capture it on film.</i>

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.046
<i> As I put the lens on,</i>

01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:20.849
<i> I saw they were
three perfect golden spheres,</i>

01:15:20.882 --> 01:15:24.185
<i> all holding this incredible
formation over my apartment.</i>

01:15:24.218 --> 01:15:25.554
The longer I filmed,

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.522
the more maneuvers
they demonstrated.

01:15:27.555 --> 01:15:30.459
<i> And it was clear the objects
were under intelligent control.</i>

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:38.099
It was Christmas morning,
December 2016.

01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:40.168
I was on my porch
having coffee

01:15:40.201 --> 01:15:43.371
when I saw this incredible
double-staged orb

01:15:43.404 --> 01:15:44.673
<i> flying through the air.</i>

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.741
<i> I was following
this object upward</i>

01:15:46.774 --> 01:15:50.178
<i> and it went right up like it was
gonna pass out of my line of sight</i>

01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:53.248
<i> when I asked the object,
"Please, turn back around."</i>

01:15:53.281 --> 01:15:54.916
<i> I didn't want
the experience to end.</i>

01:15:54.949 --> 01:15:56.551
<i> Amazingly, it stopped,</i>

01:15:56.584 --> 01:15:59.287
<i> changed direction
and headed back downward.</i>

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.189
<i> That was truly profound
to me</i>

01:16:01.222 --> 01:16:04.392
<i> that I could meditate,
send my thought into the universe,</i>

01:16:04.425 --> 01:16:06.962
<i> and then have a visual
response in the sky</i>

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:10.198
<i> to confirm that we are
interacting with each other.</i>

01:16:10.231 --> 01:16:12.801
That says something
about the nature of mind,

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:15.070
<i> the nature of
the phenomenon itself</i>

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:18.607
<i> and the power of our own
consciousness to interact.</i>

01:16:21.342 --> 01:16:23.111
In October 2018,

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:26.548
we had the biggest sighting
I've seen yet in Long Beach, California.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.617
<i> My girlfriend and I were
in the backyard</i>

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.453
<i> when we saw this huge
white object in the sky.</i>

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:34.289
<i> This was different than most
of the normal orbs I have filmed.</i>

01:16:34.322 --> 01:16:35.957
<i> This object was elongated</i>

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.994
<i> and almost looked
like a moving portal in the sky.</i>

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.396
<i> Amazingly, once I got
the camera on it,</i>

01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:43.999
<i> and incredible triangle
formation of orbs</i>

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.067
<i> shot out of
this main object</i>

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.802
<i> and I captured it on film.</i>

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:51.272
<i> You can hear how excited
I am in the film to see this again,</i>

01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:53.842
<i> this triangle formation
for the third time.</i>

01:16:55.343 --> 01:16:57.846
Wow! What the fuck
is that thing?

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.682
Wow!

01:17:03.284 --> 01:17:05.053
Holy shit.

01:17:07.321 --> 01:17:10.659
Continued to film the object
as it traversed across the sky

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.627
<i> when suddenly
it started ejecting</i>

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.863
<i> a series of these
smaller orbs.</i>

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:17.532
<i> Fifty smaller objects
and counting.</i>

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:19.701
<i> Strangely, I could only see
the small orbs</i>

01:17:19.734 --> 01:17:21.136
<i> on my infrared camera.</i>

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:23.505
<i> They were not visible
to the naked eye.</i>

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:26.141
<i> It goes to show you how much
is flying around in the sky</i>

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.509
<i> that we can't see.</i>

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:37.886
<i> About six months after I had
the near-death experience,</i>

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.688
<i> and I began
learning meditation,</i>

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:42.457
<i>I was sitting up on a mountain
up in North Carolina.</i>

01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:44.325
And right before sunset,

01:17:44.358 --> 01:17:46.161
I looked over
towards the southwest

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:49.998
<i> and I saw a beautiful
silver disc, seamless,</i>

01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:51.733
<i> Close Encounter
of the First Kind.</i>

01:17:51.766 --> 01:17:54.669
It looked exactly
like the ET craft I had seen

01:17:54.702 --> 01:17:57.672
<i> when I was eight or nine
when I was a child in North Carolina,</i>

01:17:57.705 --> 01:18:00.875
which actually ignited
my interest in all of this.

01:18:00.908 --> 01:18:02.744
So, I said, "Oh, well.
They're back."

01:18:02.777 --> 01:18:04.546
I didn't think
much more about it.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:06.881
<i> So I sat to meditate and I went
to this very deep meditation.</i>

01:18:06.914 --> 01:18:08.717
<i> By the time I came out of
the meditation,</i>

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:12.487
<i> it was very pitch dark and there was
the whole Milky Way galaxy.</i>

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.492
It was above my head,
and a thought was sent in to me.

01:18:17.525 --> 01:18:18.893
It was very clear.

01:18:18.926 --> 01:18:22.497
It wasn't my random thought
or a hallucination at all.

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:25.767
And it said, "Behold, what a beautiful
universe God has made."

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.738
<i> And with that, I went right
into the state of consciousness</i>

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.272
<i> that I was in
in the near-death experience,</i>

01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:33.642
<i> except now I'm awake
and standing on the mountain.</i>

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.177
<i> And at that instant,</i>

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:39.414
I became aware that there was
sort of a glow...

01:18:39.447 --> 01:18:43.451
An energy field right below
the peak and through the forest.

01:18:43.484 --> 01:18:46.521
I thought it was a deer
standing on its hind legs.

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:49.224
And it had these
beautiful deer-like eyes.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.293
And I went, "What is that
doing here?" You know.

01:18:52.326 --> 01:18:53.862
And I realized
it wasn't a deer,

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:58.032
and it actually appeared
and then dematerialized,

01:18:58.065 --> 01:19:00.368
came over and touched me
on the right shoulder.

01:19:00.401 --> 01:19:02.370
But I could sense
its energy field

01:19:02.403 --> 01:19:05.306
was still there. It was phasing
in and out of 3D

01:19:05.339 --> 01:19:10.311
and the near dimension
of astral energy.

01:19:10.344 --> 01:19:13.114
And when it
touched my right shoulder,

01:19:13.147 --> 01:19:15.784
I could actually see
my ski jacket indent.

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:19.754
And all my hair stood on end.
It was like this electromagnetic pulse.

01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:21.623
And I had long hair,
and it sort of... Ding!

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.057
At that instant,

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.794
<i> I vanished off the mountain top
on to the ship</i>

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:29.464
<i> and then we were, bang,
almost instantly out in space.</i>

01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:33.067
So, at that point, I stayed
in this meditative state

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.970
and was teaching
the ETs

01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:39.007
what it was like to be
in that state of consciousness

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.010
but also be a boy,
a young man, on Earth.

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.145
They were very
interested in this.

01:19:44.178 --> 01:19:48.283
And then we kinda merged
together in our meditation

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:53.488
and I created with them this protocol
for making contact with them.

01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:56.357
<i>Two years later,</i>

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:59.627
<i> Dr. Greer attempted
to recreate the experience</i>

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.096
<i> during a meditation
teacher training course</i>

01:20:02.129 --> 01:20:03.331
<i> in the French Alps,</i>

01:20:03.364 --> 01:20:08.269
<i> resulting in the first mass
witness CE5.</i>

01:20:08.302 --> 01:20:11.873
What we experienced in France
was really life-changing for me.

01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:16.611
<i> It was the summer of 1975,
and that was the year we both turned 20.</i>

01:20:16.644 --> 01:20:19.447
When we were in teacher training,
it was very intensive.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.516
<i> We were meditating,
doing yoga,</i>

01:20:21.549 --> 01:20:25.286
<i> listening to endless tapes
of Maharishi.</i>

01:20:25.319 --> 01:20:29.390
<i> So I did a deep meditation,
went into the state</i>

01:20:29.423 --> 01:20:33.862
<i> and could sense
where in space these ET craft were,</i>

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.231
<i> connected to them,
introduced myself by name</i>

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.466
<i> and then vectored them
like you would vector a jet</i>

01:20:38.499 --> 01:20:40.335
<i> into JFK Airport.</i>

01:20:42.203 --> 01:20:45.173
All of a sudden,
right out of nowhere,

01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:50.511
appeared a metallic, silent,
tetrahedron-shaped

01:20:50.544 --> 01:20:52.680
<i> silver ship.</i>

01:20:52.713 --> 01:20:54.415
It just appeared.

01:20:54.448 --> 01:20:56.651
And I said,
"What is that, Steve?"

01:20:56.684 --> 01:20:59.187
<i> There was no sound.</i>

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.190
And it was just suspended
in the air and then gone.

01:21:02.223 --> 01:21:03.859
<i> And it was just
the blue sky again.</i>

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.527
<i> It will happen</i>

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.731
<i> if you do it with just a pure
state of innocence about it.</i>

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.566
<i> And that's when I realized</i>

01:21:11.599 --> 01:21:14.435
<i>that this can actually be done
with groups of people.</i>

01:21:14.468 --> 01:21:16.905
<i> And I just filed that away.</i>

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:45.900
<i> In 1977, Dr. Greer discovered
how precisely he could vector ETs</i>

01:21:45.933 --> 01:21:48.236
<i> to a specific location.</i>

01:21:48.269 --> 01:21:50.471
<i> Upon reconnecting
with those beings</i>

01:21:50.504 --> 01:21:52.573
<i> using the CE5 protocols,</i>

01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:55.810
<i> he showed them his location
in the Blue Ridge Mountains,</i>

01:21:55.843 --> 01:21:59.580
<i> but first directed them
to where he was born and raised,</i>

01:21:59.613 --> 01:22:01.816
<i> in Charlotte, North Carolina.</i>

01:22:01.849 --> 01:22:03.351
<i> Then he went to sleep.</i>

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:24.272
<i> Unbeknownst to him, that
attempt to initiate contact</i>

01:22:24.305 --> 01:22:27.308
<i> precipitated a major sighting
over Charlotte</i>

01:22:27.341 --> 01:22:29.844
<i> involving pilots
and air traffic control.</i>

01:22:29.877 --> 01:22:33.848
<i> An insider has leaked
the FAA traffic control tapes</i>

01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:35.483
<i> that corroborated
the encounter.</i>

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.864
<i> What I experienced
was that I'm awakened</i>

01:22:49.897 --> 01:22:53.434
<i> and there is this kind of
beautiful cobalt blue ship,</i>

01:22:53.467 --> 01:22:58.439
<i> maybe 20 feet above the ground
outside my window. The bedroom window.</i>

01:22:58.472 --> 01:23:03.277
<i> This wakes up my housemate,
who's in the bedroom adjacent to mine.</i>

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:06.447
<i> He comes running out,
he says, "What did you do?"</i>

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.020
<i> And the lesson from that
was the specificity of the vector.</i>

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.788
<i> In other words,
I was very specific.</i>

01:23:13.821 --> 01:23:15.723
<i> I vectored them first
to Charlotte,</i>

01:23:15.756 --> 01:23:17.792
<i> showed them
where Charlotte was,</i>

01:23:17.825 --> 01:23:19.394
<i> the epicenter where all this
was going on,</i>

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:22.163
<i>was over the part of Charlotte
where I was born and all that.</i>

01:23:22.196 --> 01:23:24.866
<i> And then guided them
from there up here.</i>

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.401
<i> I think what they
were saying to me is,</i>

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:28.403
<i> "We can be very specific
with instructions.</i>

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:29.904
<i> "And we'll show you that."</i>

01:23:29.937 --> 01:23:31.739
<i> It was
a teachable moment.</i>

01:23:31.772 --> 01:23:34.242
<i> And I sort of felt like
I really shouldn't do this</i>

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:36.544
<i> unless I have
some higher purpose to.</i>

01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:48.589
<i> In 1990,</i>

01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:52.160
<i> he formed the Center for the Study
of Extraterrestrial Intelligence</i>

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:55.163
<i> to disseminate
the CE5 protocols</i>

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:58.933
<i> and establish peaceful
and sustainable relations</i>

01:23:58.966 --> 01:24:00.802
<i> with ET lifeforms.</i>

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.572
<i> Two years later,
Dr. Greer and his team</i>

01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:07.675
<i> went up to Woodborough Hill
in Wiltshire, England.</i>

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:11.245
<i> There, they visualized
and thought a geometric pattern</i>

01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:14.415
<i> symbolizing the trilogy
of components</i>

01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:16.617
<i> that make up
the CE5 protocols.</i>

01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:19.754
<i> Thought, light and sound.</i>

01:24:19.787 --> 01:24:24.392
<i> Immediately, this crop circle
appeared in the field nearby.</i>

01:24:40.174 --> 01:24:44.378
So, some of these civilizations
that we're interacting with on our teams

01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:46.647
are in the order
of a billion years

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.382
<i> beyond our development.</i>

01:24:48.415 --> 01:24:51.486
<i> And all those beings
in that civilization</i>

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:54.388
<i> are in a state
of unity consciousness</i>

01:24:54.421 --> 01:24:55.756
<i> that is so enlightened</i>

01:24:55.789 --> 01:24:57.592
<i> that they could
be confused</i>

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.727
<i> with, say, an angel
or something.</i>

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.229
<i> But they're not.
They're not from...</i>

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:04.966
<i> They're ETs with star systems
and planets and bodies,</i>

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:06.501
<i> but their level
of consciousness</i>

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:10.138
would be at the level of, say,
the highest spiritual realm.

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:15.176
<i> There's a precise correlation
to the kind of technology</i>

01:25:15.209 --> 01:25:18.146
<i> that you will observe
and the level of consciousness</i>

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.814
<i> that civilization
has attained.</i>

01:25:19.847 --> 01:25:21.415
<i> Let's take
our own civilization.</i>

01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:24.018
<i> We're mostly
still separate people.</i>

01:25:24.051 --> 01:25:27.688
<i> And we're operating through
a reductionist separate paradigm.</i>

01:25:27.721 --> 01:25:30.191
<i> We're also still very violent
and destructive.</i>

01:25:30.224 --> 01:25:31.859
So let's look at
our technologies.

01:25:31.892 --> 01:25:35.029
<i> Oil, we're burning something
and destroying the air.</i>

01:25:35.062 --> 01:25:36.764
<i> Nuclear power,</i>

01:25:36.797 --> 01:25:39.600
<i> we're splitting and tearing apart
an atom to create heat,</i>

01:25:39.633 --> 01:25:42.770
<i> to turn a turbine,
to create electricity.</i>

01:25:42.803 --> 01:25:45.673
<i> Coal, we're digging stuff up
and destroying mountains</i>

01:25:45.706 --> 01:25:48.876
<i> and then burning the stuff
in a fiery furnace.</i>

01:25:48.909 --> 01:25:51.512
It's all very destructive.

01:25:51.545 --> 01:25:53.848
And so our technologies

01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:57.118
are a corollary to our inner
state of consciousness.

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:58.986
<i> In 1964,</i>

01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:01.355
<i> Soviet astronomer
Nikolai Kardashev</i>

01:26:01.388 --> 01:26:03.324
<i> proposed
a hypothetical scale</i>

01:26:03.357 --> 01:26:07.562
<i> of measuring a civilization's level
of technological advancement</i>

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:12.867
<i> based on the amount of energy
they're able to utilize.</i>

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.371
<i> A level 1 civilization,
also called a planetary civilization,</i>

01:26:17.404 --> 01:26:21.175
<i> can use and store all the energy
available on this planet.</i>

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:22.743
At that point,

01:26:22.776 --> 01:26:24.478
their main focus becomes

01:26:24.511 --> 01:26:27.014
the development of higher states
of consciousness,

01:26:27.047 --> 01:26:29.550
<i> because they have
all the technologies</i>

01:26:29.583 --> 01:26:32.587
<i> to meet everyone's needs.
There's no shortage.</i>

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.090
<i> Their economic system
is non-economic</i>

01:26:36.123 --> 01:26:39.227
<i> in the sense that there is
infinite abundance for everyone</i>

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.062
<i> because of
these technologies.</i>

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:45.399
<i> They can materialize things
out of the substrate of spacetime,</i>

01:26:45.432 --> 01:26:48.069
<i> the elementals
of spacetime.</i>

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:51.672
<i> So, at that point,
a civilization becomes</i>

01:26:51.705 --> 01:26:55.943
really focused on the development
of higher states of consciousness.

01:26:55.976 --> 01:27:00.414
<i> And as they evolve in consciousness,
their technologies evolve with them.</i>

01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:04.018
<i> They will begin
to then unfurl</i>

01:27:04.051 --> 01:27:07.088
<i> the mysteries of consciousness
and these</i> siddhis

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.789
<i> I mentioned earlier
in the Vedas,</i>

01:27:08.822 --> 01:27:10.391
<i> but those get applied
technologically,</i>

01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:14.028
<i> which include levitation,
teleportation,</i>

01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:16.264
<i> dematerialization,
bilocation,</i>

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:19.900
where the same object can be
instantly, resonantly created

01:27:19.933 --> 01:27:21.369
and be in two places
at once.

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:22.670
We've had this happen
on our team.

01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:46.661
I like this story of this
Lockheed Skunk Works

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.963
<i> top secret witness
who defected.</i>

01:27:48.996 --> 01:27:51.065
He was trying to
learn a technique

01:27:51.098 --> 01:27:54.068
to go into meditation,
but then astrally project.

01:27:54.101 --> 01:27:56.304
And he did. And he went up
out of his body

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:58.673
<i> with his astral
body of light,</i>

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.141
<i> went up into the air</i>

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:03.177
and slammed right into the side
of an ET spacecraft.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.079
But what he couldn't understand
was that

01:28:05.112 --> 01:28:08.649
when he bumped up
against the ET spacecraft

01:28:08.682 --> 01:28:10.251
with his astral body,

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.019
<i> the body all of you...</i>

01:28:12.052 --> 01:28:14.522
<i> When you have a lucid dream
and you're flying over the water</i>

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.957
<i> or flying over...
That is your body of light.</i>

01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:18.492
<i> The same thing when you have
a near-death experience.</i>

01:28:18.525 --> 01:28:19.827
<i> You go in
your body of light.</i>

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.996
Well, his astral body

01:28:22.029 --> 01:28:24.465
hit the side of this craft
and it rocked it.

01:28:24.498 --> 01:28:25.933
And then
he popped inside,

01:28:25.966 --> 01:28:28.102
the ETs were looking at him
like, "My God.

01:28:28.135 --> 01:28:30.705
"Why don't you watch where you're going?
Cosmic faux pas."

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.306
But he moved the ship.

01:28:32.339 --> 01:28:36.177
He says, "How did my astral body
move that ET spacecraft?"

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:38.646
I said, "Because the density
of that spacecraft

01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:42.283
"resonantly, energetically,
was identical to your astral body

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:45.953
<i> "because with the naked eye,
it was shifted out of 3D</i>

01:28:45.986 --> 01:28:51.859
<i> "into this dimension that is increasingly
conscious energy and conscious forms.</i>

01:28:51.892 --> 01:28:56.330
<i> "And since like
can interface with like,</i>

01:28:56.363 --> 01:28:59.233
<i> "your density of your own astral body
and that craft,</i>

01:28:59.266 --> 01:29:03.137
<i> "because it was shifted
to that level, it could interact with it."</i>

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:07.141
Now, had it been a 3D craft
that had stepped down

01:29:07.174 --> 01:29:10.211
<i> like a transformer,
stepped down into full 3D,</i>

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:11.712
he would have gone
straight through it

01:29:11.745 --> 01:29:13.481
because the density
would have been different.

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:17.385
The resonant field interface
would have been different.

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.320
And when I explained
that to him,

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:22.823
he said, "Now I understand
so many things that have happened

01:29:22.856 --> 01:29:24.392
"between me and ETs"

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:26.494
The great thing
about CE5 is

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.729
it's anything but remote.

01:29:28.762 --> 01:29:30.765
<i> It is true contact.</i>

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:32.767
Steve, look!

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.368
Oh, my God!

01:29:34.401 --> 01:29:36.270
That was great!

01:29:37.571 --> 01:29:40.207
Whoa!

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.411
<i> During a CE5 expedition
of Mount Shasta,</i>

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:46.514
<i> Dr. Greer and his team
were in contact</i>

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:49.383
<i> with an interstellar object
and its occupants</i>

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:51.218
<i> in the field
in front of them.</i>

01:29:51.251 --> 01:29:55.389
<i> Suddenly, this light ship
lifted off from the ground</i>

01:29:55.422 --> 01:29:57.291
<i> and turned left,</i>

01:29:57.324 --> 01:30:03.030
<i> phasing in and out of 3D spacetime
before vanishing in clear skies.</i>

01:30:03.063 --> 01:30:08.903
<i> This was visible to the naked
eye for everyone present.</i>

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.805
You know, Dr. Greer says
our first interest

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.206
is an academic interest

01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:14.675
and in my case, that was how
I got into this.

01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:17.778
But very quickly
after that,

01:30:17.811 --> 01:30:19.713
<i> it changes to</i>

01:30:19.746 --> 01:30:24.051
<i> a heart, mind,
and soul connection</i>

01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:29.156
<i>that is really a very powerful
driving force in your life.</i>

01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:33.160
<i> And it's important to go
from the academic interest</i>

01:30:33.193 --> 01:30:35.496
<i> to the experience level.</i>

01:30:35.529 --> 01:30:37.498
<i> And that's what
happens very quickly.</i>

01:30:37.531 --> 01:30:42.470
<i> You make this transition to an experience
of this new lifestyle,</i>

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:46.107
<i> this new understanding
of our place in the universe.</i>

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.642
<i> We wanted to take action</i>

01:30:48.675 --> 01:30:51.846
because it's important to not only learn
about this academically

01:30:51.879 --> 01:30:53.614
but then to take
action on it.

01:30:53.647 --> 01:30:55.783
It was very
empowering for me,

01:30:55.816 --> 01:30:59.186
because I felt like
they helped to let us know

01:30:59.219 --> 01:31:00.421
<i> that we are on the right path</i>

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:02.857
and then we have the power
to make a change.

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:06.293
It changes you completely.
It changes your heart,

01:31:06.326 --> 01:31:10.498
and then
your entire life changes.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:13.901
All things from that point
forward are possible.

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.473
<i> I have a friend in Holland.</i>

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.975
Her name's Linda

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:25.846
and she has some very amazing
footage that she's captured.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.004
<i> This is amazing.
It'll stop, turn left,</i>

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:53.407
<i> turn right, move around
at all kinds of angles,</i>

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.877
<i> and she said multiple
events like this happened.</i>

01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:58.646
What would be evident
in that footage

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:01.815
is what she has actually
asked for them to do.

01:32:01.848 --> 01:32:03.517
So, I know this one case

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:06.220
where she has
told me herself that

01:32:06.253 --> 01:32:08.322
they have produced
a "V" shape,

01:32:08.355 --> 01:32:10.724
and she requested that
in consciousness.

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.841
<i> We see this
quite often,</i>

01:32:27.874 --> 01:32:29.944
<i> but it's very unusual
to get it on video.</i>

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:32.746
<i> And this is why
it's a fantastic example,</i>

01:32:32.779 --> 01:32:36.750
<i> the kind of maneuverability
that these spacecraft can make.</i>

01:32:36.783 --> 01:32:39.787
I really do love it when people
get things like that

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.122
and they can show people
that are new to the subject

01:32:42.155 --> 01:32:44.725
because it's
really inspiring.

because it was uncomfortable
not to be able to hear it.

01:36:26.613 --> 01:36:30.317
<i> I got to my room and I felt this draw
to go back out there.</i>

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:32.152
So, I got up
and walked out

01:36:32.185 --> 01:36:35.455
and I saw this red light
out in the middle of the desert,

01:36:35.488 --> 01:36:37.491
about 300 feet away or so.

01:36:37.524 --> 01:36:39.526
<i> I connected with it
right away.</i>

01:36:39.559 --> 01:36:41.695
I could feel it and knew
that it was aware of me

01:36:41.728 --> 01:36:44.765
and then it was indeed the thing
that was calling me.

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:49.536
So I invited it to come
and hang out.

01:36:49.569 --> 01:36:53.040
At one point, Daniel heard me
talking to this red orb

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.942
and he couldn't
believe it either.

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:57.811
He went and got his camera
and took a short video clip

01:36:57.844 --> 01:36:59.313
of this red orb.

01:37:00.647 --> 01:37:02.616
He said that for
the next 45 minutes

01:37:02.649 --> 01:37:05.052
he had a communication
with them,

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:08.856
and at the end of
the conversation, he said,

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:11.192
"Do you think you can do
something about my hearing?"

01:37:12.559 --> 01:37:14.962
<i> I got some sleep
and when I woke up,</i>

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.965
<i> I went out to breakfast
with some of the people in the group.</i>

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:21.335
<i> I had hearing aids, and they weren't
with me at breakfast.</i>

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:25.038
And it was a very emotional
event for me to discover

01:37:25.071 --> 01:37:29.142
that I could hear everything
everyone was saying at the table,

01:37:29.175 --> 01:37:33.046
and not only at my table,
but at tables away from me.

01:37:33.079 --> 01:37:36.149
<i> And I haven't
worn my hearing aids since.</i>

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:38.886
I had a hard time finding them
to bring them here.

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:43.323
They do a very good job,
but not as good as the ETs did.

01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:45.759
<i> It's changed my life.
You know, it really has.</i>

01:37:45.792 --> 01:37:48.428
And that's the part...

01:37:48.461 --> 01:37:50.197
that gets me.

01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:51.765
<i> I didn't know
this happened to him</i>

01:37:51.798 --> 01:37:54.501
until I saw him the next day
on the hammock.

01:37:54.534 --> 01:37:57.504
And he was
just relating this story,

01:37:57.537 --> 01:37:59.673
<i> and he was
crying like a baby.</i>

01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:02.109
<i> Just to watch the emotion
coming out of him</i>

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:05.913
was very moving, and he's had
perfect hearing since then.

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:09.049
<i> My takeaway from the event</i>

01:38:09.082 --> 01:38:11.919
and from my experience
with the ETs is that

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:14.021
they've been in my life
a long time

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:15.956
and I just didn't know it.

01:38:15.989 --> 01:38:19.093
<i> It's such a beautiful world
waiting for us.</i>

01:38:22.495 --> 01:38:24.765
It's useful for us to think
about our own experience

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.266
over the last couple
hundred years.

01:38:26.299 --> 01:38:28.368
<i> If you go back 200
and some years</i>

01:38:28.401 --> 01:38:31.138
<i> and show Thomas Jefferson
a modern smartphone,</i>

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:32.739
to anyone of that period,

01:38:32.772 --> 01:38:34.775
it would look like
something that was magic.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.385
<i> We're dealing
with civilizations</i>

01:38:45.418 --> 01:38:48.422
<i> where almost every aspect
of how they appear</i>

01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:51.725
<i> in our time space
would look like magic to us.</i>

01:38:51.758 --> 01:38:56.063
<i> And in the CIA, this is actually
called WSFM.</i>

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.165
<i> Sounds like a radio station.
It stands for</i>

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.500
<i> Weird Science
and Frickin' Magic.</i>

01:39:00.533 --> 01:39:03.170
<i> A space craft can be
completely 3D</i>

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.973
<i> like you see
a solid aircraft.</i>

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:08.475
<i> It can be partially
in this dimension,</i>

01:39:08.508 --> 01:39:11.745
<i> but shifted mostly
into another dimension.</i>

01:39:11.778 --> 01:39:13.580
<i> So I liken this to, like,</i>

01:39:13.613 --> 01:39:16.416
<i> when you're turning a dial
on an old AM radio</i>

01:39:16.449 --> 01:39:18.452
and you can move it across

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.921
and you suddenly pick up Chicago
and New York

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.956
at the same time.
They're bleeding together.

01:39:22.989 --> 01:39:24.624
Dimensional bleeding.

01:39:24.657 --> 01:39:27.194
And so,
often these ET craft

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:29.629
will be partially
in this dimension

01:39:29.662 --> 01:39:31.331
<i> but mostly out.</i>

01:39:31.364 --> 01:39:33.767
<i> And all that we will detect
in this dimension</i>

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.535
<i> might be
an electronic signature,</i>

01:39:35.568 --> 01:39:38.705
<i> orb or an object that appears
and flashes in and out,</i>

01:39:38.738 --> 01:39:41.875
a scintillation of light
that then vanishes,

01:39:41.908 --> 01:39:47.214
<i> or an object that comes in
where it looks almost like a hologram</i>

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:50.450
<i> of an ET being that would be
standing amongst us,</i>

01:39:50.483 --> 01:39:53.787
<i> but it's an electronically
teleported version</i>

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.522
<i> of that conscious being.</i>

01:39:55.555 --> 01:39:58.191
I love this one.
His name is Bijoux.

01:39:58.224 --> 01:39:59.659
<i> It's pronounced Bijoux.</i>

01:39:59.692 --> 01:40:02.863
<i> He's an interstellar being
from Andromeda.</i>

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.698
<i> And he has a very
bright-looking nose</i>

01:40:04.731 --> 01:40:09.136
<i> 'cause there is an orb here
that teleported him on to the site.</i>

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.571
<i> With the naked eye,
the only thing that was seen</i>

01:40:11.604 --> 01:40:14.508
was this sphere that came up
right beside my shoulder.

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:18.645
What was amazing is there was
a light kind of illuminating this being.

01:40:18.678 --> 01:40:21.882
He was just floating
in sort of this energetic space

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:24.251
and it looked like
he was waving at me.

01:40:24.284 --> 01:40:25.685
He started doing
this, floating.

01:40:25.718 --> 01:40:27.487
<i> He's in the air,
maybe five feet up.</i>

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.257
<i> When I asked him
where he was from,</i>

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:33.260
<i> he said he's from
Andromeda galaxy.</i>

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:35.262
Sometimes I have
to pinch myself

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.998
and make sure, you know,
I do a little self-check

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:40.734
to make sure I'm just really
seeing something

01:40:40.767 --> 01:40:42.169
or it's not my imagination.

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:45.739
But that was a huge confirmation
that, you know,

01:40:45.772 --> 01:40:48.708
we are really on to something
with what we're doing.

01:40:48.741 --> 01:40:50.677
That we are
really making contact.

01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:54.114
The ETs are participants
in the whole story,

01:40:54.147 --> 01:40:55.582
in this whole unfoldment.

01:40:55.615 --> 01:40:57.350
So it's really amazing

01:40:57.383 --> 01:41:00.520
that you're communicating
with someone from, you know,

01:41:00.553 --> 01:41:02.522
an entirely different world

01:41:02.555 --> 01:41:06.626
and, you know,
it's mind-boggling, really.

01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:08.028
Now, this is beautiful.

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:10.030
We were on the beach
and this appears.

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:12.532
Right on the sand
in front of me.

01:41:12.565 --> 01:41:14.901
<i> And you can see the eyes
very faintly.</i>

01:41:14.934 --> 01:41:16.803
<i> It's barely
in this dimension,</i>

01:41:16.836 --> 01:41:19.473
<i> it's very crystalline.</i>

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:22.109
<i> It's pitch black
on this beach.</i>

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:24.644
This being,
highly intelligent,

01:41:24.677 --> 01:41:29.116
an extraterrestrial civilization
at the level of the celestial.

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:32.219
So, visualize
humanity evolving

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.920
<i> to the point that
everyone on Earth</i>

01:41:33.953 --> 01:41:37.090
<i> were in cosmic consciousness
and enlightenment.</i>

01:41:37.123 --> 01:41:38.725
That's what
we're talking about.

01:41:38.758 --> 01:41:42.062
Half a million to a billion years
ahead of us.

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.163
Get a load of this.

01:41:43.196 --> 01:41:44.831
We're in a deep meditation
I'm leading,

01:41:44.864 --> 01:41:46.566
we're in
cosmic consciousness.

01:41:46.599 --> 01:41:48.835
<i> This is a Peruvian doctor.
Medical doctor.</i>

01:41:48.868 --> 01:41:51.171
<i> I call it
the cosmic spermatozoa.</i>

01:41:51.204 --> 01:41:53.440
<i> -It looks...</i>
<i> And it comes in</i>

01:41:53.473 --> 01:41:54.841
<i> and it wraps around her</i>

01:41:54.874 --> 01:41:57.310
<i> and she begins to have
the</i> kundalini

01:41:57.343 --> 01:42:00.180
<i>and an enlightenment experience
like she's never had.</i>

01:42:00.213 --> 01:42:03.650
<i> And, of course, this happens
a lot on these expeditions,</i>

01:42:03.683 --> 01:42:06.520
<i> but we got it on photograph.
Isn't that cool?</i>

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:08.522
I love this one.

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:12.092
<i> This was off the edge of the hill,
and you can see people turning to look.</i>

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:15.662
<i> And it was this object
that materialized into this dimension</i>

01:42:15.695 --> 01:42:18.031
<i> and lit up and then
dematerialized.</i>

01:42:18.064 --> 01:42:20.433
What I saw
in my remote view

01:42:20.466 --> 01:42:24.804
<i> was a very large craft filled with ETs
from different civilizations</i>

01:42:24.837 --> 01:42:26.973
<i> that were joining us
in the meditation.</i>

01:42:27.006 --> 01:42:28.542
'Cause that's what
they're interested in.

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:31.478
They're interested if you have
a pure heart, a clear intent

01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:34.181
and you're wanting to join them
in universal peace.

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.850
That's it. They don't care
about your degrees,

01:42:36.883 --> 01:42:39.019
they don't care about...

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:41.555
This is what the Prince
of Liechtenstein said,

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:44.024
"You know, I have gone all over
the world where these UFOs are seen,

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:46.026
"and they're seen
before I'm there and after,

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:48.361
but when I'm there, they're not around.
Maybe it's my attitude."

01:42:48.394 --> 01:42:50.030
I said, "Bingo!"

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:52.966
Every experience that could be...
That was described,

01:42:52.999 --> 01:42:55.802
no matter how unbelievable,
in Dr. Greer's books

01:42:55.835 --> 01:42:58.471
or the manuals, we've
experienced them ourselves.

01:42:58.504 --> 01:43:00.974
<i> And someone snapped a photo
with their iPad.</i>

01:43:01.007 --> 01:43:04.377
<i> Beams of energy in...
With arrowheads on them</i>

01:43:04.410 --> 01:43:06.246
<i> coming out of
members' third eye</i>

01:43:06.279 --> 01:43:07.547
and the heart's center.

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.416
<i> When we looked closer
at the photo here,</i>

01:43:09.449 --> 01:43:11.551
<i> there was this silhouette,
and they were standing...</i>

01:43:11.584 --> 01:43:12.886
<i> Before we had
broken the circle,</i>

01:43:12.919 --> 01:43:15.188
<i> they were standing
under the hands of people</i>

01:43:15.221 --> 01:43:16.723
<i> as we had held
hands there.</i>

01:43:16.756 --> 01:43:19.559
<i> So, you could see
a bald being with a long robe,</i>

01:43:19.592 --> 01:43:20.860
<i> about four feet tall.</i>

01:43:20.893 --> 01:43:22.429
So that was an amazing shot.

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:24.164
What I began to understand

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:27.167
is that there's this whole
spectrum of phenomena

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.603
that involves 3D matter,

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:32.539
light, sounds that emerge,

01:43:32.572 --> 01:43:35.508
tonality,
electromagnetic interface.

01:43:35.541 --> 01:43:39.546
<i> For example, we have electronic devices
we'll have out, like a radar detector,</i>

01:43:39.579 --> 01:43:42.716
<i> magnetometers that pick up
the magnetic field shift.</i>

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:47.254
Those will all start being activated
when a craft is approaching.

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:49.022
<i> And we're out in the middle
of the wilderness</i>

01:43:49.055 --> 01:43:51.925
<i> where there's no source of this
electromagnetic radiation,</i>

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:55.762
<i>but they'll start communicating
in a specific cadence</i>

01:43:55.795 --> 01:43:57.697
<i> and a repeatable cadence.</i>

01:43:57.730 --> 01:44:00.867
And I call this transdimensional
electronic communication.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.603
And they will actually
take over the circuitry

01:44:03.636 --> 01:44:07.540
<i> of these electronic devices
we have out in the desert</i>

01:44:07.573 --> 01:44:11.478
and begin to do
a specific communication.

01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:13.413
Now, you have to decode it,

01:44:13.446 --> 01:44:16.449
but it's reproducible.
And their different civilizations

01:44:16.482 --> 01:44:18.318
will have a different pattern.

01:44:18.351 --> 01:44:23.056
So this is an electronic version
of them making contact.

01:44:23.089 --> 01:44:25.925
<i> On the shores of the Outer Banks
in North Carolina,</i>

01:44:25.958 --> 01:44:29.663
<i> ETs produce these tones
via the team's radar detector.</i>

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:39.105
<i> An enormous
golden object appeared,</i>

01:44:39.138 --> 01:44:40.707
<i> illuminating the ocean.</i>

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.544
Yes.

01:44:47.613 --> 01:44:51.484
<i> Another object appeared
and made a 180-degree turn,</i>

01:44:51.517 --> 01:44:53.953
<i> a maneuver that
no satellite could make,</i>

01:44:53.986 --> 01:44:58.458
<i> then dematerialized
in clear skies.</i>

01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:02.028
What comes up
in the context of CE5

01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:03.763
is, "Something's happening."

01:45:04.897 --> 01:45:06.633
"What is it?

01:45:06.666 --> 01:45:09.102
"How's it gonna affect me?

01:45:09.135 --> 01:45:12.138
"Is it..." And all the drama
comes up.

01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:14.040
The <i> Independence Day</i> images,

01:45:14.073 --> 01:45:17.711
the... The drama
that's all through YouTube.

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:22.882
All of the programming that is out there
comes up because we're saturated in it.

01:45:22.915 --> 01:45:26.720
What I would suggest to people,
if they are experiencing fear

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.822
or if they feel apprehensive
about doing it,

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:30.857
<i> make sure you
do it in a group.</i>

01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:35.862
<i> Make sure you set up
the parameters of unity,</i>

01:45:35.895 --> 01:45:41.034
<i> of peace. This is a frequency that is
far out of the spectrum of fear.</i>

01:45:41.067 --> 01:45:43.303
<i> So, there's
an incompatibility there.</i>

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:46.806
<i> In a scientific perspective,
if you think about resonant waves,</i>

01:45:46.839 --> 01:45:51.144
<i> the energy, the gratitude,
love, joy, peace, all of that...</i>

01:45:51.177 --> 01:45:53.713
<i> This is a frequency
that we establish first</i>

01:45:53.746 --> 01:45:55.815
<i> through whichever practice
appeals to you</i>

01:45:55.848 --> 01:45:58.585
and then extend your connection
from there.

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:00.720
<i> Researchers have discovered</i>

01:46:00.753 --> 01:46:04.557
<i> that remote viewing and
meditation are most effective</i>

01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:09.262
<i> when the participant enters a state
called heart-mind coherence.</i>

01:46:09.295 --> 01:46:12.665
<i> A human heart
contains 40,000 neurons</i>

01:46:12.698 --> 01:46:16.836
<i> that can sense, feel,
learn and remember.</i>

01:46:16.869 --> 01:46:20.673
<i> You can bring your mind and heart
into this coherent state</i>

01:46:20.706 --> 01:46:23.510
<i> and have more access
to intuitive knowing</i>

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:27.080
<i> by consciously focusing
on positive emotions</i>

01:46:27.113 --> 01:46:29.215
<i> during your meditation.</i>

01:46:29.248 --> 01:46:32.419
<i> These beings can... They respond
to our thought.</i>

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:36.689
<i> They respond to our thought,
so they will not be invasive.</i>

01:46:36.722 --> 01:46:39.392
<i> And if you're feeling
like you want to continue</i>

01:46:39.425 --> 01:46:42.729
whatever contact experience
that is happening,

01:46:42.762 --> 01:46:45.031
but there may be a bit of
residual fear

01:46:45.064 --> 01:46:47.634
that you're trying
to work through, tell them.

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:50.470
Say, "Look, I'd love
to carry on doing this,

01:46:50.503 --> 01:46:52.739
"but I feel a bit scared
right now.

01:46:52.772 --> 01:46:54.574
"Can you help me with that?"
You know?

01:46:54.607 --> 01:46:56.109
And they will.

01:46:56.142 --> 01:46:58.311
And that's the other evidence.
I know they're not hostile.

01:46:58.344 --> 01:47:00.146
We've been all over the world,

01:47:00.179 --> 01:47:03.716
thousands of hours
with thousands of people,

01:47:03.749 --> 01:47:05.819
have had all manner of contact,

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.954
at a distance,
and intimately.

01:47:07.987 --> 01:47:10.957
Beings... ET beings
appearing in our rooms.

01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:13.460
All kinds of things.
No one has ever been harmed.

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:15.128
No one has ever
been harmed at all.

01:47:15.161 --> 01:47:19.098
This is an unofficial document
on the FBI website

01:47:19.131 --> 01:47:20.633
sort of hidden
in plain sight.

01:47:20.666 --> 01:47:23.670
But it really confirms everything
that we're explaining

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:25.405
but also the experience
we've had.

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:29.642
And this is from 1947,
so this is 72 years old.

01:47:29.675 --> 01:47:31.144
<i> He goes through
and describes</i>

01:47:31.177 --> 01:47:33.079
<i> that they are
peaceful people,</i>

01:47:33.112 --> 01:47:34.981
<i> they traverse
these dimensions,</i>

01:47:35.014 --> 01:47:37.317
<i>that they have these abilities
and consciousness.</i>

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:40.753
<i> He even relates to
some of the Vedic terms</i>

01:47:40.786 --> 01:47:44.324
<i> of the kind of capabilities
witnessed from these beings.</i>

01:48:08.481 --> 01:48:12.318
Even though what I'm doing
with CE5 is what I'm most ridiculed for,

01:48:12.351 --> 01:48:16.723
it was the project that got
the most respect and attention

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:19.692
from the intelligence community
'cause they knew it was real.

01:48:19.725 --> 01:48:21.961
They knew the science of
consciousness is real.

01:48:21.994 --> 01:48:26.633
They knew that these ET civilizations
utilize communication technologies

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:29.836
that interface with thought,
telepathy and consciousness.

01:48:29.869 --> 01:48:33.873
They all know this. This is an open secret
in the intelligence community.

01:48:33.906 --> 01:48:40.213
<i>We all think that power is derived from
your weapons system, your financial clout,</i>

01:48:40.246 --> 01:48:42.515
the usual
materialistic paradigm.

01:48:42.548 --> 01:48:44.217
The reason that
the deeper elements

01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:47.020
of the intelligence community have
this intense interest in it

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.655
and don't want
the public to know

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:53.426
is that, first of all,
it is extremely efficient spy craft

01:48:53.459 --> 01:48:55.094
which they don't want
others to have.

01:48:55.127 --> 01:49:00.199
<i> Secondly, they know that
if people understood the power</i>

01:49:00.232 --> 01:49:03.102
<i> of consciousness and of
mass consciousness,</i>

01:49:03.135 --> 01:49:08.207
<i> they would be able to completely change
the direction of the planet.</i>

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.276
That is, to me,
the big secret.

01:49:10.309 --> 01:49:13.046
Most people have heard of the random
number generator studies

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.681
through the Global
Consciousness Project.

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:17.083
A question tonight,
can you actually measure

01:49:17.116 --> 01:49:19.719
the emotional outpouring
in a worldwide crisis?

01:49:19.752 --> 01:49:22.288
Sometimes scientists think
that they have done just that.

01:49:22.321 --> 01:49:25.024
Their machines and computers
found a bizarre pattern

01:49:25.057 --> 01:49:27.193
right after several
global disasters.

01:49:27.226 --> 01:49:28.962
<i> This was an experiment</i>

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:32.065
<i> in which researchers placed dozens
of random number generators</i>

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:35.101
<i> around the world
and analyzed their data</i>

01:49:35.134 --> 01:49:37.537
<i> to see if they could
discover anything</i>

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:40.073
<i> about global
or collective consciousness.</i>

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:41.708
On September 11th,

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:44.143
<i> a few hours before
the first plane struck,</i>

01:49:44.176 --> 01:49:48.448
<i> this network of random number generators
became more coherent,</i>

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:50.116
<i> less random
and more coherent.</i>

01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:53.052
MAN: <i> It may sound bizarre,
but Dr. Nelson and his team</i>

01:49:53.085 --> 01:49:55.488
<i> have been at this for the better part
of a decade.</i>

01:49:55.521 --> 01:49:59.959
<i> The first spike showed up in 1997
with the death of Princess Diana.</i>

01:49:59.992 --> 01:50:02.161
<i> Other events like
the Concorde crash,</i>

01:50:02.194 --> 01:50:04.664
<i> the Madrid train bombing
and the Pope's funeral,</i>

01:50:04.697 --> 01:50:07.433
<i> all registered on those
random number generators.</i>

01:50:07.466 --> 01:50:10.169
<i> But early on the morning
of September 11th,</i>

01:50:10.202 --> 01:50:12.839
<i> the data went
off the charts</i>

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:19.812
<i> The odds of this being a coincidence
is less than one in 100 billion.</i>

01:50:19.845 --> 01:50:23.149
<i> This shows there is
a deep relationship</i>

01:50:23.182 --> 01:50:27.453
<i> between collective consciousness
and the physical world.</i>

01:50:27.486 --> 01:50:30.423
Sociology studies
of meditators,

01:50:30.456 --> 01:50:35.428
<i> where they go into a community, say,
you have a town of 200,000 people,</i>

01:50:35.461 --> 01:50:38.698
<i> and they would send in 1%
of the population equivalent,</i>

01:50:38.731 --> 01:50:41.768
<i> 2,000 people,
to go into deep meditation.</i>

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:45.138
<i> And they found that
emergency room visits declined,</i>

01:50:45.171 --> 01:50:47.173
<i> violent crimes declined,</i>

01:50:47.206 --> 01:50:50.677
<i> robberies... All kinds of
negative behaviors declined.</i>

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:53.513
Even though those people didn't
even know they were in the city.

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:56.549
Because there is
this resonant effect

01:50:56.582 --> 01:50:58.951
through the force, if you want
to look at it that way.

01:50:58.984 --> 01:51:03.956
Through this entangled,
interwoven consciousness field,

01:51:03.989 --> 01:51:07.060
and people who didn't even know
these meditators were there

01:51:07.093 --> 01:51:09.162
became more ordered,
more peaceful,

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:11.130
more happy,
et cetera, and so on.

01:51:11.163 --> 01:51:12.732
<i> This was actually based on</i>

01:51:12.765 --> 01:51:14.534
<i> the studies done
in quantum physics</i>

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:16.469
<i> in which a container
of helium</i>

01:51:16.502 --> 01:51:18.805
<i> was cooled down
to absolute zero.</i>

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:22.241
<i> When only 1% of the helium
became aligned to coherent,</i>

01:51:22.274 --> 01:51:26.012
<i> the entire container went through
a phase transition,</i>

01:51:26.045 --> 01:51:31.851
<i> instantly shifting into coherence
and taking on almost magical properties,</i>

01:51:31.884 --> 01:51:35.254
<i>a state called super fluidity.</i>

01:51:35.287 --> 01:51:39.926
So there was this transformation
at that 1% point.

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:42.028
When a critical
mass of people,

01:51:42.061 --> 01:51:44.230
whether it's 1%
or a fraction of that

01:51:44.263 --> 01:51:46.499
depends on the state
of consciousness

01:51:46.532 --> 01:51:49.435
of those who are
practicing the meditation

01:51:49.468 --> 01:51:52.004
or a prayer or coherence.

01:51:52.037 --> 01:51:56.175
But at that point, you can shift
an entire civilization.

01:51:56.208 --> 01:51:58.111
If we all become coherent,

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:01.080
just 1% of us,
like a molecule of helium,

01:52:01.113 --> 01:52:04.617
and we become aligned and coherent
and move in the right direction,

01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:08.054
it will transform
the other 99%,

01:52:08.087 --> 01:52:09.956
even though they don't know
that we're doing it.

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:13.593
And that's the beauty and the power
of the structure

01:52:13.626 --> 01:52:16.028
of non-locality
in consciousness

01:52:16.061 --> 01:52:18.131
is that it's all interwoven.

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:20.032
But there is enormous power

01:52:20.065 --> 01:52:23.536
when you're operating at that deeper level
of consciousness.

01:52:23.569 --> 01:52:26.806
And that, the intelligence community
is very much afraid of

01:52:26.839 --> 01:52:30.076
because that's something,
A, they cannot control

01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:35.081
and, B, it would transcend their ability
to alter the outcome.

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:51.631
I'll tell you
a really funny story.

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:55.935
In '92, the head of army intelligence
and a few of his minions

01:52:55.968 --> 01:52:59.572
intercepted me and took me
to a hotel room, very threatening.

01:52:59.605 --> 01:53:02.408
There was a national security
agency person there, CIA people.

01:53:02.441 --> 01:53:04.677
They were saying, "What the hell
do you think you're doing,

01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:09.482
<i> "teaching people to bypass our systems
and contact these civilizations?"</i>

01:53:09.515 --> 01:53:13.419
<i> I said, "I don't recognize
your authority over this matter."</i>

01:53:13.452 --> 01:53:17.089
<i> And then I looked him in the eyes
and I said, "I'm not afraid of you,</i>

01:53:17.122 --> 01:53:20.860
<i> "because I died when I was 17,
and I know there is no death.</i>

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:23.362
"I don't care
about your money,

01:53:23.395 --> 01:53:25.832
<i> "and I've had direct contact
with these civilizations,</i>

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:29.936
<i> "so you can't deceive me about who
they are and why they're here."</i>

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:31.771
And the General
just sat back like this

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.707
and went, "We know exactly
who this son of a bitch is."

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:37.944
And I said, "Yes. So, this is
what we're gonna do."

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:40.880
It was very frustrating
for them, but later,

01:53:40.913 --> 01:53:44.550
a member of one of the European
royal families, who I don't wanna name,

01:53:44.583 --> 01:53:48.621
who was involved with that crowd
came up to me and she said,

01:53:48.654 --> 01:53:51.624
"You know, they're very jealous of what you
and your team are doing."

01:53:51.657 --> 01:53:53.226
I said, "Jealous of what?"

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:54.627
These are the most powerful
people in the...

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:56.495
She says, "No.

01:53:56.528 --> 01:54:01.234
<i> "They know that you guys actually,
collectively have all the power.</i>

01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:04.003
"And they wish they could
do what you're doing

01:54:04.036 --> 01:54:08.507
<i> "but they're in the box
of this National Security State program</i>

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.844
<i>"that they cannot escape from,
and you're free.</i>

01:54:11.877 --> 01:54:13.312
"You're a free agent.

01:54:13.345 --> 01:54:16.148
<i> "You're free to do wonderful
things and they're not.</i>

01:54:16.181 --> 01:54:19.085
"And they're really jealous
of what you guys are doing."

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:22.421
It was a real insight
into the sad psychology

01:54:22.454 --> 01:54:26.726
of the people who are in this
pinched, small world.

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:29.095
So I say to the public,

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:32.565
you should be happy that you are
not part of all that.

01:54:32.598 --> 01:54:36.369
You have the freedom to do
things they can never do.

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:37.703
So let's do it.

01:54:37.736 --> 01:54:41.741
It's good to know that we have
the tools we need

01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:44.277
when we apply CE5 protocols.

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:47.246
So anybody can do it no matter
where you're from,

01:54:47.279 --> 01:54:48.648
you know,
what background...

01:54:49.648 --> 01:54:51.217
You can just learn
the protocols.

01:54:51.250 --> 01:54:53.185
We have a lot of friends
from around the world

01:54:53.218 --> 01:54:55.121
who have never been
on one of these expeditions,

01:54:55.154 --> 01:54:57.757
and they just go online
and use the protocols

01:54:57.790 --> 01:55:01.627
and apply them and have
wonderful experiences.

01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:05.564
I'm practicing CE5 in Cambridgeshire,
United Kingdom.

01:55:05.597 --> 01:55:06.632
Colorado Springs.

01:55:06.665 --> 01:55:08.567
Creston, British Columbia,
Canada.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.269

We are doing a CE5 in Hong Kong
and making history.

01:55:58.150 --> 01:56:00.619
<i> People from all walks of life</i>

01:56:00.652 --> 01:56:02.922
<i> are becoming
interstellar ambassadors</i>

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:06.592
<i> and experiencing transcendent states
of consciousness</i>

01:56:06.625 --> 01:56:09.462
<i> in union with these beings.</i>

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:12.164
<i> Thousands are making contact</i>

01:56:12.197 --> 01:56:17.970
<i> by simply using the guided meditation
in the CE5 Contact app.</i>

01:56:18.003 --> 01:56:21.640
<i> It's up to the children of Earth
to become active participants</i>

01:56:21.673 --> 01:56:27.013
<i> in the unfolding of our universe,
and not leave it to the power elite.</i>

01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:29.448
<i> Once we reach a critical mass
of people,</i>

01:56:29.481 --> 01:56:32.018
<i> a coherent and
enlightened minority</i>

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:37.156
<i> can transform the rest
of humanity, instantly.</i>

01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:40.659
It's more about
what your intent is.

01:56:40.692 --> 01:56:43.696
If you have a pure heart
for lack of a better word,

01:56:43.729 --> 01:56:46.999
you have a clearness in your mind
and in your heart,

01:56:47.032 --> 01:56:50.536
can you bring your mind and heart
into resonance together

01:56:50.569 --> 01:56:53.506
and invite these civilizations
to connect with you

01:56:53.539 --> 01:56:56.809
in this great purpose,
this great journey

01:56:56.842 --> 01:56:59.211
that we're launching on
as a civilization

01:56:59.244 --> 01:57:01.380
where we are going to
become interstellar.

01:57:01.413 --> 01:57:05.384
Interestingly, there was a colonel,
the name of Philip Corso.

01:57:05.417 --> 01:57:08.020
<i> And Colonel Corso wrote a book,</i>
The Day After Roswell,

01:57:08.053 --> 01:57:10.089
<i> and one of the events
that wasn't known</i>

01:57:10.122 --> 01:57:15.161
was this encounter he had with an ET
at White Sands Missile Range.

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:18.898
<i> It was right... Not far from where
the first atomic bomb was dropped.</i>

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:24.603
And this was 1956, and an interstellar
vehicle came in and it landed.

01:57:24.636 --> 01:57:29.208
So he gets in his Jeep, rushes out there,
this young, brash colonel,

01:57:29.241 --> 01:57:32.445
and has a meeting,
an encounter with this ET.

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:36.348
<i> At this point, the ET asked
the colonel to switch off</i>

01:57:36.381 --> 01:57:39.452
these radar systems that had
piggybacked on them

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:43.556
electronic warfare systems that were
knocking these spacecrafts down

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:46.192
and the colonel leaned in
and said,

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:47.794
"What's in it for me?"

01:57:50.429 --> 01:57:52.398
And the ET looked at him
and said,

01:57:52.431 --> 01:57:54.801
"A new world,
if you can take it."
