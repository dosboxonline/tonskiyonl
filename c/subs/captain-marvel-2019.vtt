WEBVTT

02:13.720 --> 02:14.920
Do you know what time it is?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.560
Can't sleep.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.600
There are tabs for that.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.800
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.880
Dreams again?

02:27.320 --> 02:28.720
Wanna fight?

02:32.280 --> 02:33.280
I slipped.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.520
Right, you slipped

02:34.600 --> 02:36.240
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
I was already slipping

02:37.440 --> 02:38.480
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.080
The two events
were not related.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.800
Tell me about this dream.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.840
-Anything new?
-No.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.640
You have to let go
of the past.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.960
I don't remember my past.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.640
It's causing you doubt,

02:55.720 --> 02:57.480
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.720
Control it.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.480
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

03:10.560 --> 03:12.000
with the Supreme Intelligence.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.000
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.120
Humor is a distraction.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.280
-And anger?
-

03:24.360 --> 03:25.920
Anger only serves the enemy.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.640
One hundred twenty days

03:38.720 --> 03:40.600
since the last Skrull attack.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.080
VERS: Has anyone ever seen

03:42.160 --> 03:43.800
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

03:43.960 --> 03:46.600
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

03:46.680 --> 03:48.000
in its true form.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.320
You know that.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.640
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.080
So it's sacred. It's personal.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.080
No Kree divulges it, ever.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
VERS: Who do you see?

04:01.440 --> 04:02.440
-Your brother?
-No.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.800
-Father?
-No.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.000
-Your old commander?
-Vers.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.400
It's me you see, isn't it?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.240
I see
what you're trying to do.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.840
Is it working?
-Yes.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.680
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.160
What is the point of
giving me these...

04:16.320 --> 04:18.040
if you don't want me
to use them?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.880
I want you to use them.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.760
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

04:21.920 --> 04:23.720
of showing you
how to use them.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.880
I know how.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

04:26.080 --> 04:27.120
knock me down without them.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.840
Control your impulses.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.280
Stop using this,
start using this.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.040
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.240
Vers.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.840
Intelligence.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.120
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.320
I am.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.840
You struggle
with your emotions...

05:32.360 --> 05:34.840
with your past,
which fuels them.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.600
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

05:39.760 --> 05:42.840
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.920
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

05:46.080 --> 05:48.080
then take over our planets.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.560
Horrors that you remember...

05:51.720 --> 05:54.280
and so much that you do not.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.600
It's all blank.
My life.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.320
You're supposed
to take the form

06:03.400 --> 06:05.080
of who I most admire...

06:05.240 --> 06:09.600
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.800
Perhaps this is a mercy

06:11.880 --> 06:14.200
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.680
Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...

06:18.680 --> 06:21.000
put your people's needs
before your own.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.560
We've given you a great gift.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.240
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.840
I want to serve.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.960
Then master yourself.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.720
What was given
can be taken away.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.160
I won't let you down.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.360
We'll know soon enough.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.440
You have a mission.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.280
Serve well, and with honor.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.640
This can't be good.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.640
Must be another Skrull attack.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.280
Whatever it is, it's big.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.520
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

07:15.680 --> 07:16.720
KORATH: Once.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.080
-It was deeply disturbing.
-Why?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.440
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

07:21.600 --> 07:23.480
and the face staring back
was my own.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.080
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

07:25.160 --> 07:26.520
then it would be
less disturbing.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.640
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

07:28.840 --> 07:29.960
You never laugh.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.600
I laugh on the inside.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.280
I'm not doing that now.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.600
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

07:35.680 --> 07:36.760
you're quite handsome.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.000
Well, thank you.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.240
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.720
All right.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.560
Prepare for...

07:45.560 --> 07:48.240
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.640
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.600
This time, Torfa.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.280
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.640
The Skrull general, Talos,

08:01.720 --> 08:03.400
has sent kill units
to find him.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.120
Should they reach him
before we do...

08:05.280 --> 08:06.440
the intelligence he's acquired

08:06.520 --> 08:08.240
over three years
is as good as theirs.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.080
The Accusers will bomb

08:11.160 --> 08:13.120
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.040
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

08:16.640 --> 08:19.640
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.360
The Torfan populace.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.440
We are not to interfere
with them,

08:23.520 --> 08:24.560
nor them with us.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.000
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.840
Proceed with caution.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.400
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.560
This is a dangerous mission.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.560
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

08:38.640 --> 08:40.080
if that is our fate today.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.240
For the good of all Kree.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
ALL: For the good of all Kree!

09:52.640 --> 09:55.120
YON-ROGG:
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.920
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.280
MINN-ERVA:
Locals on the periphery.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.360
Maybe a dozen.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.960
-YON-ROGG: Minn-Erva?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.240
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
Repeat.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.800
-

10:41.920 --> 10:43.760
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.720
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.000
Only one way in,
only one way out.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.680
BRON-CHAR:
We can get past the locals.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.440
We don't know
if they are locals. Too risky.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.680
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.880
No, you won't.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.880
Right. We keep a close radius.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.080
We lose comms,
we meet back at the Helion.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.360
Come on.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.960
Att-Lass, you getting this?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.520
Copy. I see them.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.720
KORATH: Get back!

11:33.440 --> 11:34.440
Commander?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.280
-Get back! Back!
-

11:44.960 --> 11:47.680
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.320
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.720
-Does anybody copy?
-

11:56.840 --> 11:58.160
I don't wanna hurt you.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.960
Keep back!

12:05.480 --> 12:06.480
Stay back!

12:10.640 --> 12:13.040
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
They're just starving.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.880
HGX-78.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.800
TRT79-VVX6.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.320
-Get back.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
YON-ROGG: Skrulls!

13:16.280 --> 13:17.280
Vers!

13:17.480 --> 13:19.560
Vers? Skrulls.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.560
It's an ambush.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.560
Incoming!

13:46.840 --> 13:48.200
Back to the Helion.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.760
Vers. Do you copy?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.320
Back to the Helion.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.640
Come in. Vers.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.440
How did you know the code?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.520
How about
I tell you my secret...

14:00.160 --> 14:02.560
when you've told me yours?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.600
Let's open her up.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.000
Where are we?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.560
NOREX: Stand by.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.560
Where's your head at?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.800
In the clouds. Where's yours?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.520
On my shoulders.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.240
About to show these boys
how we do it.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.800
You ready?

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
Higher, further, faster, baby.

14:35.960 --> 14:36.960
That's right.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.360
TALOS: This can't be right.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.600
Go back even further.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.280
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

15:11.880 --> 15:14.320
TALOS: Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?

15:14.440 --> 15:15.520
What the hell
are you thinking?

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
You don't belong out here!

15:16.840 --> 15:18.120
NOREX: I think
we went back too far.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.640
You let him drive.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.160
NOREX: Let me try something.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.760
CADET OFFICER:
Give up already!

15:24.920 --> 15:26.560
You don't belong out here!

15:28.440 --> 15:31.040
-You're not strong enough.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.560
You'll kill yourself.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.920
They'll never let you fly.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.440
TALOS: Am I the only one
that's confused here?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.720
You're a decent pilot.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.920
But you're too emotional.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.800
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

15:56.320 --> 15:59.520
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

15:59.680 --> 16:02.640
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.840
And so,

16:03.920 --> 16:05.680
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.560
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.080
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.440
VERS: Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.720
TALOS: Charming memory.

16:15.880 --> 16:16.880
NOREX: Hang on.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.440
I think I've got it.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.560
Goose likes you.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.120
She doesn't typically
take to people.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.600
Early start to your morning.

16:27.760 --> 16:28.920
Uh, late night, actually.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.000
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.160
Sound familiar?

16:32.320 --> 16:33.840
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.800
LAWSON:
Wonderful view, isn't it?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.800
I prefer the view
from up there.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.120
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.360
TALOS: Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.160
NOREX: Stand by.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.000
LAWSON: Sound familiar?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.680
Wonderful view, isn't it?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.560
I prefer the view
from up there.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.840
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.040
TALOS:
What's that on her shirt?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.400
I couldn't read it.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.760
LAWSON:
Wonderful view, isn't it?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.120
I prefer the view
from up there.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.040
-TALOS: Focus.
-Excuse me?

17:09.200 --> 17:10.880
TALOS: Look down.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.920
Focus.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.760
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
Do you hear that, too?

17:17.080 --> 17:18.400
TALOS: Do we have
her location?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.520
NOREX: Got it.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.480
TALOS: Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.440
Interesting.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.000
Huh. Hold on.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.320
Go back right before this.
Go back.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.600
That's no MiG, Lawson.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.120
TALOS: This is it. Now let me
see where you're headed.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.760
That's right.
Look at the coordinates.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.840
Focus.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.040
Open, please.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.680
That's it. That's it.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.080
You're almost there.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.800
You're almost there.
Don't fight it.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.720
Focus!

18:00.520 --> 18:02.080
Get her back!
Get her back now!

18:06.840 --> 18:08.080
This doesn't make any sense.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.640
Do we have any information
we can act on?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.040
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
We're on our way.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.120
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.400
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

18:38.720 --> 18:40.040
And everything we're after.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.760
Oh!

18:49.720 --> 18:50.920
That did something.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.400
Try that again.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.040
Not yet!

19:14.560 --> 19:15.960
What did you do to me?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.480
Now we're just after
a little information.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.120
What did you put in my head?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.160
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.120
But those aren't my memories.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.800
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.160
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.400
They really did
a number on you.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.640
Enough of your mind games.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.280
-What do you want?
-

19:37.400 --> 19:39.840
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.560
and her light-speed engine.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.400
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

19:43.560 --> 19:47.120
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.120
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

20:19.200 --> 20:20.240
how these things come off,
would ya?

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
No?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.280
Fine.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.120
Hmm.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
Hey.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.640
You do
know why they call it a...

22:20.680 --> 22:21.960
TALOS: You leaving so soon?

22:22.960 --> 22:24.400
We're just getting to know
each other.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.840
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.680
Hello? Do you copy?

24:25.200 --> 24:27.040
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.400
Is this C-53?

24:30.960 --> 24:33.520
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.680
Yeah. I understand you.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.200
Oh, good.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.160
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

24:40.880 --> 24:43.720
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater
has its own guy.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.080
Where can I find
communications equipment?

24:54.200 --> 24:55.320
Thank you.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.360
Track the pod. Find the girl.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.920
She knows more than she knows.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.320
Hey.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.960
This one's taken.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.760
Come on.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.360
YON-ROGG: Vers?

25:53.520 --> 25:54.600
Vers?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.280
Verify. CTC-39.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.600
GRXV-1600.

25:58.760 --> 25:59.960
And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.480
Is everyone okay?
What happened?

26:02.640 --> 26:04.440
Skrull ambush.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.160
I thought we'd lost you.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.360
Did you find Soh-Larr?

26:07.520 --> 26:08.720
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.800
Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.120
That's impossible.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.120
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.560
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.760
The machine that they used...

26:17.920 --> 26:19.800
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.360
Vers, where are you?

26:21.520 --> 26:23.000
I'm on planet C-53.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.120
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.640
Who?

26:27.800 --> 26:30.920
She's who I see.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.720
She's what?

26:33.440 --> 26:34.720
Vers?

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
Vers, what?

26:38.240 --> 26:39.440
She's a scientist.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.440
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.200
I have to get to her
before they do...

26:43.360 --> 26:44.800
or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.720
No. You've been
caught once already.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.480
How far is C-53?

26:50.200 --> 26:52.640
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.800
YON-ROGG: Vers, hold your
position until we get there.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.920
Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.960
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

26:59.040 --> 27:00.080
-AUTOMATED VOICE: We're sorry.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.200
A long-distance
company access code

27:01.280 --> 27:02.280
is required for the number
you have dialed.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.000
-Yon-Rogg?
-Vers?

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400
Vers?

27:06.600 --> 27:07.880
Please dial your call
with the access code.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
Vers?

27:10.160 --> 27:12.800
KORATH: If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.960
She's stronger than you think.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.760
Ever been to C-53?

27:18.440 --> 27:19.520
Once.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.400
It's a real shithole.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.760
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.400
Did you call this in?

27:59.080 --> 28:00.080
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Beacon activated.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.880
Excuse me, miss.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.440
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

28:07.600 --> 28:10.760
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

28:10.960 --> 28:13.560
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.080
Oh.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.400
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.120
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

28:22.440 --> 28:26.280
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.440
Could I see
some identification, please?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.360
Vers. Kree Starforce.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.520
We don't carry
our identification

28:31.600 --> 28:32.600
on little cards.

28:32.680 --> 28:33.680
Vers?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.320
Starforce?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.080
How long you plan
to be in town?

28:39.280 --> 28:40.320
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

28:40.480 --> 28:41.720
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

28:41.800 --> 28:43.520
that are infiltrating
your planet.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.720
Skrulls?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.320
Shapeshifters?

28:47.480 --> 28:50.520
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.600
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

28:54.120 --> 28:56.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.280
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

29:02.440 --> 29:04.240
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.320
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.440
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.720
You're under arrest.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.760
Rook!

29:21.640 --> 29:22.880
Rook, let's roll!

29:32.600 --> 29:33.720
Did you see her weapon?

29:33.880 --> 29:36.120
-I did not.
-

29:44.960 --> 29:46.080
MAN: Watch it!

30:18.680 --> 30:21.120
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.920
STAN LEE: "Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

30:49.840 --> 30:52.080
"Trust me, true believer."

31:38.240 --> 31:39.240
MAN: Get off!

32:34.960 --> 32:36.720
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.720
Let's greet them
at the station.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.280
Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.320
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.640
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

33:02.160 --> 33:04.160
I finished
collecting evidence...

34:32.400 --> 34:33.640
MAN: We need an ambulance!

34:33.840 --> 34:35.000
MAN 2: Someone call 911!

34:35.160 --> 34:36.640
MAN 3: Hey! You all right?

34:36.840 --> 34:38.640
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

34:38.840 --> 34:39.840
Anyone else see that?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.920
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.280
MAN: Nice scuba suit.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.640
Lighten up, honey, huh?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.640
Got a smile for me?

35:46.880 --> 35:48.080
Freak.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.840
EXAMINER: All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.640
Whatever he runs on,

36:13.720 --> 36:15.000
it's not
on the periodic table.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.760
You're saying
he's not from around here?

36:18.760 --> 36:19.840
Hey, how's your eye?

36:20.840 --> 36:23.000
Well, I'd say fine...

36:23.240 --> 36:25.600
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

36:28.240 --> 36:33.280
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

36:33.400 --> 36:35.280
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.160
And the woman said
that there were more?

36:38.320 --> 36:40.240
The word she used
was "infiltration."

36:40.400 --> 36:41.440
You believe her?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.160
Not till I saw this.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.440
What's your plan?

36:47.080 --> 36:48.880
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.200
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

36:51.280 --> 36:52.640
that fits her description.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.520
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

36:56.120 --> 36:58.240
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.440
Good.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.200
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.360
Not even our own men.

37:06.520 --> 37:07.760
Yes, sir.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.000
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

37:25.320 --> 37:28.960
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.240
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.080
I will finish what we started.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.680
EXAMINER: I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.400
No one in or out.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.240
Boom!

38:57.560 --> 38:58.640
What can I get ya?

38:59.080 --> 39:00.560
Where was
this photograph taken?

39:01.520 --> 39:02.600
An airport.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.000
Where's Pegasus?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.760
FURY: That's classified.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.480
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.680
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.480
Grunge is a good look for you.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.160
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

39:17.320 --> 39:18.760
It was cool, you know?

39:18.960 --> 39:21.720
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.360
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.400
Typical nine-to-five.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
So you saw one?

39:28.760 --> 39:31.480
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

39:32.440 --> 39:34.400
but I can't unsee that.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.200
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.680
You think I'm one of those
green things.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.120
Can't be too careful.

39:41.280 --> 39:46.040
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.520
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.640
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

39:49.800 --> 39:51.520
No. The DNA would match.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.760
Want my AOL password?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.920
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

39:55.040 --> 39:57.040
-of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.720
You wanna get personal.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.840
-Where were you born?
-Huntsville, Alabama.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.400
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.000
-Name of your first pet?
-Mr. Snoofers.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.440
-Mr. Snoofers?
-That's what I said.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
Do I pass?

40:07.600 --> 40:08.960
Not yet. First job?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.880
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.120
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.320
-Then?
-Spy.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.560
-Where?
-It was the Cold War.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.800
We were everywhere.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.640
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.280
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.600
-Now?
-Been riding a desk

40:21.680 --> 40:22.680
for the past six years...

40:22.800 --> 40:23.840
trying to figure out
where our

40:23.920 --> 40:24.920
future enemies
are coming from.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.160
Never occurred to me

40:26.240 --> 40:28.520
they would be coming
from above.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.000
Name a detail so bizarre

40:30.080 --> 40:31.400
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.480
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.840
You didn't need that, did you?

40:41.040 --> 40:42.680
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.960
Okay. Your turn.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.800
Prove you're not a Skrull.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.920
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

40:58.000 --> 40:59.200
you're not a Skrull?

40:59.360 --> 41:00.640
That's a photon blast.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.080
And?

41:02.160 --> 41:03.160
A Skrull can't do that.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.440
So, a full bird colonel

41:05.520 --> 41:06.640
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

41:06.840 --> 41:09.280
must have pretty high
security clearance.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.920
Where's Pegasus?

41:16.600 --> 41:19.520
FURY: Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

41:19.600 --> 41:21.360
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

41:21.520 --> 41:25.560
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

41:25.720 --> 41:28.240
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

41:28.400 --> 41:32.000
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

41:33.280 --> 41:35.120
They believe
that she developed

41:35.200 --> 41:37.040
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.760
Light-speed engine?

41:39.840 --> 41:41.160
Gotta admit, that's not

41:41.240 --> 41:42.560
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.280
Well, it's still early.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.400
And you, what do you want?

41:46.560 --> 41:48.840
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.920
And?

41:54.080 --> 41:57.400
Look, war is
a universal language.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.280
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.680
You got a personal stake
in this.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.480
This is government property.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.400
-Turn your vehicle around.
-

42:16.560 --> 42:19.600
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.960
Place your thumb on the pad.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.280
One moment.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.400
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

42:29.040 --> 42:30.560
Everybody calls me Fury.

42:30.720 --> 42:34.600
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.160
-What does your mom call you?
-Fury.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.840
-What do you call her?
-Fury.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.040
What about your kids?

42:39.240 --> 42:40.960
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.360
GUARD:
You are cleared for access.

42:42.440 --> 42:43.440
Thank you.

43:13.480 --> 43:14.680
Oh, hold up.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.880
You look like
somebody's disaffected niece.

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
Put that on.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.320
-What is it?
-It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.160
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

43:27.240 --> 43:28.720
help with
the covert part of your job?

43:28.880 --> 43:31.160
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.400
Lose the flannel.

43:44.480 --> 43:45.840
SECURITY CHIEF:
How can I help you?

43:46.560 --> 43:48.560
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.920
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.360
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.400
Do you know her?

44:02.680 --> 44:03.920
Follow me.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.600
VERS: Hmm.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.560
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
No.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.160
Well, this ain't it.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.400
-

44:24.440 --> 44:25.520
Is that a communicator?

44:25.720 --> 44:29.000
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.240
Who are you paging?

44:30.400 --> 44:34.080
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

45:12.720 --> 45:13.720
After you.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.520
Impressive.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.400
Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.360
FURY: Hey, there. How are you?

45:33.200 --> 45:36.000
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.560
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.960
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
What's your name?

45:42.200 --> 45:45.000
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.080
Fury?

45:46.400 --> 45:47.400
Hmm?

45:49.600 --> 45:50.880
I'll be back.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.320
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.000
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.600
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
When all you had to do was...

46:05.920 --> 46:07.440
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.640
Huh. Lawson.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.800
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.600
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

46:43.360 --> 46:47.720
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.480
Kree glyphs?

46:51.920 --> 46:53.040
FURY: Hmm?

46:54.360 --> 46:56.000
Lawson is not cuckoo.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.960
She's Kree.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.520
Well, she's dead.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.160
What?

47:04.320 --> 47:06.000
She crashed the Asis aircraft

47:06.080 --> 47:07.960
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.120
Took a pilot down with her.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.440
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.680
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.960
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.000
When did this crash happen?

47:25.800 --> 47:28.840
FURY: Six years ago. 1989.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.440
Who was the pilot?

47:32.280 --> 47:35.440
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

47:35.600 --> 47:39.720
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.000
Last person to see them alive.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.480
You okay?

47:50.280 --> 47:51.440
Mm-hmm.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.320
Back in a minute.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.280
LAWSON: This isn't about
fighting wars.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.200
It's about ending them.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.760
VERS: I know Lawson was Kree.

48:35.960 --> 48:38.840
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

48:39.040 --> 48:41.680
Do you know anything
about this?

48:41.840 --> 48:43.440
I just discovered
a mission report

48:43.520 --> 48:45.120
sent from C-53.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.320
There's only so much

48:46.440 --> 48:49.040
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

48:52.800 --> 48:56.880
Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.640
She was working
on a unique energy core.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.120
Experimenting with tech

49:02.200 --> 49:05.040
that apparently could help us
win the war.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.040
She still here?

49:13.200 --> 49:15.680
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.800
-You men stay here.
-AGENT: Yes, sir.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.840
I want to question her alone.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.800
Excellent work, Nicholas.

49:27.520 --> 49:29.360
Does it say anything about me?

49:29.520 --> 49:31.200
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.360
Why would it?

49:32.520 --> 49:35.640
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.440
On C-53?

49:39.840 --> 49:41.240
Mar-Vell is who I see

49:41.320 --> 49:42.680
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

49:42.840 --> 49:46.040
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.440
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.400
No, it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.320
Stop. Remember your training.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.760
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

49:54.920 --> 49:58.240
Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.400
FURY: She's on sublevel six.

50:01.600 --> 50:02.960
I'll get off on five...

50:03.120 --> 50:05.240
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.280
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.480
Right. Like we did in Havana.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.520
YON-ROGG: We're nearing
the jump point.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.240
Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.160
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.960
Together.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.840
Okay.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.000
Vers!

50:55.720 --> 50:56.960
Vers!

51:13.840 --> 51:15.440
Fury's colluding
with the target.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.880
Then why would he call us in?

51:17.040 --> 51:19.480
All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.960
Dead or alive?

51:35.800 --> 51:37.080
AGENT: Go. Go, go!

51:49.560 --> 51:51.680
Was it something I said?

52:09.720 --> 52:10.760
Mmm-mmm.

52:30.360 --> 52:34.240
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

52:34.880 --> 52:38.880
but they do
kinda complete the look.

52:39.520 --> 52:40.800
Don't you think?

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
VERS: You called them in?

52:59.520 --> 53:00.920
My bad.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.000
AGENT: Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

53:17.160 --> 53:18.840
They're not down here.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.280
Let's try up there.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.800
-What?
-Your communicator.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.720
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.240
FURY: Do you know
how to fly this thing?

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
Uh, we'll see.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.080
That's a yes or no question.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
Yes.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.200
That's what I'm talking about!

54:46.520 --> 54:47.800
We got a stowaway.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.000
VERS: Hang on, Goose.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.200
Goose.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.440
No, Goose.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.920
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

55:08.400 --> 55:10.080
Yes, that's right.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.080
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

55:12.440 --> 55:13.720
You the good kitty,
that's right.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.960
VERS: See anyone you know?

55:16.800 --> 55:18.240
Funny story.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.080
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.040
That was six years ago.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.360
So, you think you're the pilot

55:26.440 --> 55:27.600
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

55:27.880 --> 55:30.200
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

55:30.280 --> 55:31.280
could probably tell us.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.040
-Maria Rambeau?
-Mm-hmm.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.960
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

55:35.840 --> 55:38.400
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.840
That agent...

55:42.000 --> 55:43.920
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

55:44.080 --> 55:46.000
Coulson. The new guy.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.440
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.360
Yeah, well, give him time.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.960
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

55:53.200 --> 55:55.320
Went with his gut
against orders.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.800
That's a really
hard thing to do.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.880
But it's what keeps us human.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.400
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.680
Oh, I can see that about you.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.000
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

56:08.160 --> 56:09.360
I'm guessing that's not

56:09.440 --> 56:11.040
standard
Kree operating procedure.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.360
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

56:21.640 --> 56:22.640
Ronan.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.680
The Accusers completed
their operation...

56:24.840 --> 56:26.240
but the greater mission
was a failure,

56:26.360 --> 56:27.440
thanks to your team.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.080
It was a trap

56:29.200 --> 56:31.800
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.240
Give us their location.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.760
We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.240
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

56:37.880 --> 56:39.920
No, we'll handle this.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.200
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

56:42.280 --> 56:44.240
is a threat
to Kree everywhere.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.440
Where are they?

56:45.520 --> 56:47.240
-They are...
-Lost.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.560
They are lost for now.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.400
But we will find them.

56:52.640 --> 56:56.120
Do so, or we will.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.680
Maintain the course for C-53.

57:21.920 --> 57:24.160
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.600
Auntie Carol?

57:27.760 --> 57:29.680
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

57:30.920 --> 57:33.400
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

57:33.560 --> 57:35.680
But we knew they were lying.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.920
I'm not really
who you think I am.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.080
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.280
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

57:54.440 --> 57:55.960
FURY: You are
absolutely right, young lady.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.560
There is no such thing.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.120
'Cause if there were,

57:59.200 --> 58:01.640
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

58:01.800 --> 58:02.880
You don't believe me?

58:10.920 --> 58:12.120
No way!

58:12.560 --> 58:14.440
That's so cool!

58:14.640 --> 58:16.120
FURY: Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

58:16.200 --> 58:17.320
with those hands.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.560
Like what? Show us.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.000
Maybe later.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.480
I kept all your stuff.

58:22.680 --> 58:23.840
I'll go get it.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.400
You want to give her
a hand with that?

58:26.720 --> 58:27.800
Hmm?

58:42.800 --> 58:44.720
You don't remember anything?

58:46.200 --> 58:49.480
I see flashes.

58:50.640 --> 58:52.040
Little moments.

58:53.040 --> 58:54.520
But I can't tell what's real.

58:56.840 --> 59:00.120
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

59:00.680 --> 59:02.960
maybe it'll all make sense.

59:05.600 --> 59:09.280
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.000
Your usual move.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.160
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

59:14.680 --> 59:17.200
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

59:17.360 --> 59:19.880
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

59:19.960 --> 59:21.200
at doing something
that mattered.

59:21.360 --> 59:24.120
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

59:24.240 --> 59:25.240
and I wasn't about to argue,

59:25.320 --> 59:27.120
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.400
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.120
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

59:31.280 --> 59:32.320
Since it violates
the predetermined

59:32.400 --> 59:33.400
rules of engagement.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.720
I definitely
don't remember those.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.520
Hmm. Of course you don't.

59:41.400 --> 59:46.720
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

59:46.880 --> 59:49.920
She said
she had lives to save.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.320
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

59:52.400 --> 59:53.440
but you said that...

59:53.600 --> 59:57.120
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

59:57.320 --> 1:00:01.560
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.160
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:09.640
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:14.480
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:17.760
I know
this must be hard for you.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:19.840
Oh, what?
This part right here?

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:23.000
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:29.800
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:31.640
in a mission so secret

1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:33.800
they act
like it never even happened.

1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:39.400
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:41.360
too damn stubborn to die.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:45.440
And now you come up in here
after six years...

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.480
with your supercharged
fire hands...

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.040
and you expect me
to call you...

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.440
I don't even know what. Vers?

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.160
Is that really
who you are now?

1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:59.200
I don't know.

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:05.840
MONICA: Come look!

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:13.840
This is me
and you on Halloween.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.280
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:18.960
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:20.920
You didn't get along
with your parents...

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:22.640
so Mom said
we became your real family.

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:24.360
This is us on Christmas.

1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:25.680
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:27.440
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:28.600
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:29.760
And this is right after
you graduated.

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:31.440
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.280
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.600
And this is you with Mom

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:35.840
right after a good day
of training.

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:37.320
These were
your three favorite guys.

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:40.920
Oh, wait. I forgot.

1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.480
Your jacket.

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.040
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:45.760
after I spilled ketchup on it.

1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:01.400
MARIA: That was all
that survived the crash.

1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:04.360
Or so we thought.

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:10.720
Don't answer that.

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.520
It's just my neighbor.

1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:14.360
They can change into anyone.

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:20.680
Hi there.

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:22.080
What do you want?

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:25.200
-Uh...
-Hey, Tom.

1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:26.800
This is my friend, Carol.

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.240
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:31.640
-Yowzers.

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:34.000
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:37.480
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:38.640
and I was just wondering...

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:39.920
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.080
to get a closer look-see?

1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:43.520
-A closer look-see?
-Yeah.

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:46.800
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:48.160
Mmm.

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:49.680
You're really working overtime

1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:52.240
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.800
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.400
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:59.600
-Uh...
-Okay.

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:05.160
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:07.000
You never know
when you're gonna need

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:08.720
to borrow some sugar.

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.600
Now, hang on a second.

1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:17.200
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.320
making a mess
of your friend's house...

1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:22.400
It's a lovely home, miss.

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:23.720
Oh, my God!

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.800
What the hell?

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:31.000
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:34.080
Just don't kill me.

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.040
That would really complicate
the situation.

1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:38.880
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:40.240
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:41.960
TALOS: I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.760
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:46.920
Without deception.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:48.400
And who is that out there?

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:51.600
Okay, that's a fair point...

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:53.520
but I'm sure
that you understand

1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:55.720
I had to take
some precautions.

1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:59.040
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:00.160
with your hands bound.

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:01.480
I just wanna talk.

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:02.640
Last time we talked,

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:03.840
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.480
That was before I knew
who you were.

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.760
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:12.920
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:16.080
of your voice
from a plane crash

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:17.560
six years ago...

1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:21.960
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:25.080
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:26.240
How'd you get it?

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:27.400
She don't understand.

1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:28.880
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:30.480
that kind of allows me

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.640
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:33.840
Call me "young lady" again...

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.280
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:36.800
it's not supposed to be.

1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.200
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:42.960
BOTH: Your ass.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:45.600
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.640
But, look,
I just need your help

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:48.920
decoding some coordinates.

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:50.920
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:54.280
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

1:04:56.960 --> 1:04:59.200
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:00.800
Deal.

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:03.920
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:05.400
How'd that get in here?

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:06.600
Hmm?

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.000
-The cat?
-

1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:10.240
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:11.880
That's not a cat.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:15.040
-That's a Flerken.
-FURY: A Flerken?

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:16.760
-MONICA: Mom?

1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:25.240
MARIA: Monica.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:26.960
-Why can't I listen, too?
-Shh!

1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:56.200
What's happening?

1:05:56.360 --> 1:05:57.960
It's loading.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:03.080
Punch in the coordinates

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:07.560
5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:09.680
VERS: Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:11.200
LAWSON: My laboratory.

1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:13.600
VERS: Your laboratory?
What do you mean?

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:14.880
LAWSON: Oh, no.

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:17.040
VERS: Is that...
Wait, what is that?

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:18.560
It's not showing up
on my radar.

1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:20.280
LAWSON: Go, Carol. Fly!

1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:22.840
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:25.040
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:26.120
Yes, ma'am.

1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.320
-What do they want?
-Me. My work.

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.040
I never should have
brought you along.

1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:42.240
Here come some G's.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.520
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.200
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:21.240
Stay with me, Lawson!

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:40.840
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.440
VERS: Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:45.160
MARIA: Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:47.480
Yeah! I copy.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.240
Doc?

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:53.680
Your blood.

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:56.160
-It's blue.

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:59.520
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.360
Help me out, will ya?

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:09.480
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:10.720
VERS: Lawson?

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:14.880
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.120
To end wars?

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:20.920
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:23.600
Damn it!

1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:26.200
My name is not Lawson.

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:29.680
My real name is Mar-Vell,

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.560
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:35.960
I would say
that you're delusional...

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:37.760
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:39.320
and your blood is blue.

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:44.040
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.040
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:47.320
any more regrets.

1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:49.600
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:51.760
You gotta save 'em without me.

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:52.960
Save who? How?

1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:56.000
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:57.480
What are you doing?

1:08:58.400 --> 1:08:59.640
-

1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:19.480
We have no interest
in hurting you.

1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.200
No?

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:24.040
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.040
The energy core.

1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:29.120
Where is it?

1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:31.000
Pararescue's on the way.

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:33.720
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:36.680
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:37.880
VERS: No, wait!

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:45.680
You mean that energy core?

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:51.360
No!

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.360
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:39.520
Hold your fire.

1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.400
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.240
The core has been destroyed.

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.840
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:08.880
She's coming with us.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.120
He lied to me.

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.720
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:38.400
Now, you understand.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:41.040
What?
What do I understand now?

1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:43.080
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:44.400
He killed her...

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.040
'cause she found out
that she was

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:50.360
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:51.480
VERS: No.

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:54.200
Your people are terrorists.

1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:55.840
They kill innocents.

1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:57.760
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:01.200
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:04.880
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:08.640
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:10.800
and they destroyed our planet.

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.560
And the handful of us
that are left

1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.680
will be slaughtered next...

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:20.840
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:23.560
The core that she found

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.160
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:27.120
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:31.280
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:35.120
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:36.440
wasn't to fight wars...

1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:37.600
but to end them.

1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:43.760
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:45.840
Well, I already destroyed it.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.520
No, you destroyed the engine.

1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:50.720
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:55.160
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:56.880
we can find it.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:00.280
You'll use it to destroy us.

1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:05.560
We just want a home.

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:15.040
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:17.040
Can't you see it now?

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:18.560
You're not one of them.

1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:23.120
You don't know me.

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.960
You have no idea who I am.

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:31.320
I don't even know who I am!

1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.920
You are Carol Danvers.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.280
You are the woman
on that black box

1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:40.920
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1:13:42.720 --> 1:13:44.480
My best friend...

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:47.560
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:49.080
when no one else did.

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:54.800
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:58.240
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.480
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:03.640
You hear me?

1:14:05.080 --> 1:14:06.880
Do you hear me?

1:14:14.120 --> 1:14:16.120
Come here. Come here, girl.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.200
I got you.

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.480
TALOS: I know
I don't deserve your trust...

1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.840
but you were our only lead.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.240
We discovered
that your energy signature

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:33.080
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:35.760
Now we know why.

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:41.560
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.400
I just need your help

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:48.040
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:51.760
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.880
For orbital position
and velocity.

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:55.760
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:57.080
'cause it's not on Earth.

1:14:57.240 --> 1:14:58.320
VERS: That was the location

1:14:58.400 --> 1:14:59.480
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:01.040
If we track its course,

1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:03.440
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:05.280
It's just basic physics.

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:08.760
In orbit?

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:12.240
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:14.640
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:17.840
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.600
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:22.480
Mmm. We're going to space?

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:23.640
In what?

1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:25.440
NOREX: A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:27.720
I can handle
the modifications.

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:29.560
Mmm. Your science guy.

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:38.040
VERS:
Well, I could use a copilot.

1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:41.800
No. No, I can't.

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:43.840
I can't leave Monica.

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.800
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:49.440
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.520
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:52.720
and you used to do that.

1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:56.400
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1:15:56.480 --> 1:15:57.880
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.640
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:00.880
with
a technologically-superior

1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:01.960
foreign enemy.

1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:03.800
Correct?

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:04.960
That's what I'm saying.

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.320
-You have to go!
-Monica!

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:07.560
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:08.760
in the history of missions...

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.680
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:12.040
and watch Fresh Prince
with me?

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:13.760
What?

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:15.000
I just think
you should consider...

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:18.440
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:27.360
MARIA'S MOM:
What's going on around here?

1:16:27.560 --> 1:16:28.560
MARIA: I know, I know.

1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.120
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:37.400
Your mom's lucky.

1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:38.840
When they were
handing out kids,

1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:40.600
they gave her
the toughest one.

1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:42.200
Lieutenant Trouble.

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:44.720
You remembered.

1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:47.520
Is that mine?

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:49.840
No, no.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:52.760
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:55.840
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:58.640
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:01.880
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.800
with any sense of style...

1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:06.160
Hmm?

1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:09.320
Whoa.

1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:13.080
No.

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:16.440
Uh-uh.

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:19.480
Definitely not.

1:17:22.520 --> 1:17:24.800
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:37.080
Hmm.

1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:40.040
How do I look?

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:44.880
Fresh.

1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:06.000
What took you so long?

1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:09.120
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:12.160
-PRY46-B...
-No, no codes.

1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:14.080
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:16.800
Okay, then let's do this.

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.720
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:23.560
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:24.960
But you would never
tell me who.

1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:29.600
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:31.240
The transfusion.

1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:33.520
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:34.680
Whose blood?

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:38.480
Hmm.

1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:49.840
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:55.840
What have you done with her?

1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:58.000
You're too late.

1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:15.640
She knows?

1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:33.600
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:34.760
Come at once.

1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:37.040
For the good of all Kree,
Commander...

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:40.040
the infestation
will be eradicated.

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.040
Passing 500 and climbing.

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:50.400
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:53.760
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:56.640
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

1:19:56.800 --> 1:19:57.960
like that...

1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:00.560
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:03.480
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:05.200
Can I ask you something?

1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:07.480
Do you just
turn into anything you want?

1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:09.320
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:10.560
Can you all do it?

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.760
Physiologically? Yeah.

1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:15.120
But, uh, it takes practice...

1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:19.000
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:21.640
-Can you turn into a cat?
-What's a cat?

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:22.920
What about a filing cabinet?

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:26.400
Why would I
turn into a filing cabinet?

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:27.680
A Venus flytrap?

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:28.840
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:30.120
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.880
-VERS: Switching engines

1:20:31.960 --> 1:20:34.240
from Scramjet to Fusion.
Buckle up, folks.

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:44.440
Hey.

1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:47.080
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:48.160
Pretty much.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:23.920
VERS: Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:25.720
Where is it?

1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:31.960
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:37.400
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:44.960
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Decloaking activated.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.720
Is that it? The core?

1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:52.160
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1:22:58.320 --> 1:22:59.400
Whoa.

1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:03.200
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:18.160
We're not alone.

1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:42.640
SOREN: Talos!

1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:55.440
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.240
It's okay.

1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:25.800
We didn't know what to do.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.280
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:30.720
or the Kree would find us.

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.280
You did the right thing.

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:44.120
TALOS: It's okay, it's okay.

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:46.760
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:50.440
I am not gonna hurt you.

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:52.600
She led me to you.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:54.840
I'm so sorry.

1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:57.800
I didn't know.

1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.000
TALOS: Carol.

1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:01.800
This is war.

1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:06.000
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:08.560
But we're here now.

1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.040
You found my family.

1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:16.240
This is just the beginning.

1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:19.920
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:23.760
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:43.720
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:45.800
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:50.720
-Fraternizing with the enemy?

1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:51.960
MINN-ERVA: Uh-uh.

1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.000
What did you do
to your uniform?

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.160
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:10.000
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:11.560
TALOS: You can see
they're not soldiers.

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:14.040
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:15.400
And the core?

1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:17.200
You lied to me.

1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:21.320
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:27.680
What's given
can be taken away.

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:42.520
KREE SOLIDER:
Back here! Move, move!

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:45.120
-Get over here. Get down!
-

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:48.320
Let's go! Go, move!

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:28.760
There she is.

1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:32.960
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.040
This jacket.

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:37.680
It's killer, by the way.

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:40.560
Oh.

1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:42.680
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.600
Let me out.

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:46.160
No can do.

1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.400
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:52.320
With what exactly?

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:53.800
Your power comes from us.

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.720
You didn't give me
these powers.

1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:56.960
The blast did.

1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:58.360
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1:27:58.440 --> 1:27:59.560
to control them on your own.

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:02.080
-

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Species: Flerken.

1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:14.280
Threat: high.

1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:21.520
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:26.640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Species: human male.

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:29.040
Threat: low to none.

1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:31.520
That thing's clearly busted.

1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:33.800
Load the Flerken
onto the Helion.

1:28:34.600 --> 1:28:36.560
Eject the others into space.

1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:41.480
You did good, Ace.

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:44.120
Thanks to you...

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:46.240
those insidious shapeshifters

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:47.880
will threaten
our borders no more.

1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:50.280
I used to believe your lies...

1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:53.080
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:54.800
You're talking
about destroying them

1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:56.480
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:57.760
And neither will I.

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:01.080
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:02.720
You stole me.

1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:05.600
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.560
It's cute how hard you try.

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:19.360
But remember...

1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:21.920
without us...

1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:23.160
STEVE: Give it up, Carol.

1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.080
Stay down!

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:27.320
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
...you're weak.

1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:29.560
STEVE: You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:31.080
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
You're flawed.

1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:32.440
CADET OFFICER: Are you trying
to kill yourself?

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:34.400
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
Helpless.

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:35.600
BRET: You're too emotional
and so weak.

1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:37.400
CAROL'S FATHER:
You don't belong out here!

1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:39.520
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
We saved you.

1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:41.200
YON-ROGG: Control it.
CAROL'S FATHER: I told you,

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:42.280
-Carol.
-CADET OFFICER: They'll never

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:43.360
-let you fly.
-CAROL'S FATHER: This ain't

1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:44.560
-a game for little girls.
-BOY: You kiss like a horse.

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:45.640
CADET OFFICER: You won't last
a week, Danvers.

1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:51.920
Without us, you're only human.

1:29:53.400 --> 1:29:54.640
You're right.

1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:58.000
I'm only human.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:35.320
On Hala, you were reborn...

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:36.840
Vers.

1:30:41.840 --> 1:30:44.760
My name is Carol.

1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:01.120
She's trying to break out.

1:31:45.440 --> 1:31:48.760
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.280
But what happens when...

1:31:54.440 --> 1:31:56.480
I'm finally set free?

1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:39.520
You know you're glowing,
right?

1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:40.680
VERS: I'll explain it later.

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:44.560
Take the Tesseract.

1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:45.840
Leave the lunchbox.

1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:47.520
-Me?
-Yes.

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:49.040
I'm not touching that thing.

1:32:49.200 --> 1:32:50.280
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:57.320
Whoa!

1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:06.480
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:08.760
Take the Flerken with you.

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:11.160
-What about you?
-I'll buy you some time!

1:33:13.080 --> 1:33:14.920
I'm picking you up now.

1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:20.560
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:26.760
Oh, hey, guys.

1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:32.320
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:37.320
I used to find you amusing.

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:39.040
Let's put an end to this.

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:46.800
-

1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:15.440
Okay.

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:17.120
Good kitty.

1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:28.360
-

1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:05.360
You knew all along.

1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:07.640
Is that why we never hung out?

1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:08.920
No, I just never liked you.

1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:14.000
-

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:17.160
Incoming!

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:26.680
GUARD: Hey, in a hurry?

1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:30.680
Don't make me do this.

1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:31.920
Okay.

1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:48.800
Come on, do your thing!

1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:51.080
Come on!

1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:54.840
Come on!

1:35:57.960 --> 1:35:59.360
-Damn it, Goose.
-

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:00.560
Pick a side.

1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:03.320
-

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.640
Take them to the hangar, too.

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:08.600
We'll blast them all
into space.

1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:11.680
Play it cool.

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:14.520
Just like Havana.

1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:18.440
Do you have the thing?

1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:20.160
Flerken kitty ate it.

1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:34.920
GUARD: Come on, move!

1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:36.240
Move!

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.120
Follow my lead.

1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:43.120
Cover her eyes.

1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:53.160
-Onto the ship!

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.080
Let's go! Let's go!

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:11.880
-

1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:19.920
Nice diversion.

1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:22.040
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:46.280
-

1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:21.160
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:22.400
On it.

1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:28.200
You all right, friend?

1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.200
Never better.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.800
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1:40:17.680 --> 1:40:19.320
Yes! Boom!

1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:36.520
Whoo!

1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:41.200
What the hell was that?

1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:06.720
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:00.400
RONAN: That's impossible.

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.960
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:05.680
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:09.640
ACCUSER: That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:15.280
Take her down.

1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:36.240
Whoo!

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:27.760
Return to the jump point.

1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:30.920
We'll be back for the weapon.

1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:33.680
The core?

1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:36.800
The woman.

1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:26.400
I'm so proud of you.

1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:29.760
You've come a long way

1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:31.800
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:34.480
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:36.760
long enough to take me on?

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:39.600
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:42.840
I always told you...

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.280
you'll be ready

1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:46.720
the day you can knock me down
as yourself.

1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:48.320
This is that moment.

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.000
This is that moment, Vers!

1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:52.240
Turn off the light show...

1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:55.760
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:13.280
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:31.160
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Destination: Hala.

1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:32.960
I can't go back empty-handed.

1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:34.880
You won't be empty-handed.

1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:37.320
I'm sending you
with a message.

1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:40.680
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:43.600
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:46.840
You can't do this.

1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:09.320
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:10.400
-

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:11.880
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.040
-Ow!

1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:14.360
Mother Flerken!

1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:15.640
-You okay?
-FURY: Yeah.

1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:17.640
It's just a scratch.

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.280
No.

1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:28.680
-VERS: I can't believe

1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:30.160
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:31.640
and I missed it.

1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:33.400
MARIA: I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.600
FURY: Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:37.760
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:39.640
I'll consider it...

1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:42.800
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.160
How's your eye?

1:46:44.240 --> 1:46:46.360
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:47.760
Just so I'm clear...

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:49.280
you were Soh-Larr...

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:51.480
-and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
-FURY: Keller.

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.320
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:57.320
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1:46:57.520 --> 1:46:58.760
It is a little like stealing.

1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:00.200
Whose side are you on here?

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.040
FURY: You're good to go here
until you recover...

1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:05.240
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:07.000
I could go back
to being your boss.

1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:08.160
Uh, please don't.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:11.200
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:13.680
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.840
Don't ever change your eyes.

1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:17.400
TALOS: She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:19.160
MONICA: I was trying
not to panic...

1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:20.760
I'll help you find a home.

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:23.000
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:27.240
MONICA: They can stay here
with us.

1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:29.000
Can't they, Mom?

1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:31.080
They won't be safe here, baby.

1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:33.240
Auntie Carol's right.

1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:34.400
They need their own home.

1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.400
I'll be back
before you know it.

1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:41.160
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:44.120
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:45.680
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:47.520
-You don't know.
-He doesn't.

1:47:57.280 --> 1:47:59.680
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:01.400
Hidden.

1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:03.600
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:05.360
Mar-Vell.

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:06.800
That's what I said.

1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.320
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:10.840
Mar-Vell.

1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:12.080
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:13.440
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:28.440
Not ringing any bells?

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.400
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:47.240
I upgraded it.

1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:50.320
Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:55.160
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:58.880
For emergencies only, okay?

1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:05.640
Well...

1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:08.600
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:10.800
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:14.840
-Oh!

1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:29.600
MONICA: We got
the ketchup stain off.

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:36.840
VERS: Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:48.720
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:03.560
Go on.

1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:13.360
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:19.520
So, is it true?

1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:21.800
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.400
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:29.040
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:30.360
Understood.

1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:32.880
I'm sorry to report

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.000
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:36.360
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:39.680
I'll let you know
when it does.

1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:41.240
Then what?

1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:42.800
Sir?

1:51:43.160 --> 1:51:44.280
We have no idea

1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:47.400
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:49.600
And our one-woman
security force

1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:50.920
had a prior commitment...

1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:52.840
on the other side
of the universe.

1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:57.720
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1:51:59.480 --> 1:52:01.000
We need to find more.

1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:02.320
More weapons?

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:04.080
More heroes.

1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:05.880
You think you can find
others like her?

1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:08.960
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:11.360
Get some rest, sir.

1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:14.280
You got
a big decision to make.

1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:15.080
This is a nightmare.

1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:19.000
I've had better nightmares.

1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:22.200
RHODES: Hey.

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:25.400
So, that thing just stopped

1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:27.160
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.880
What do we got?

1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:34.080
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1:55:34.320 --> 1:55:35.360
STEVE: I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:36.440
RHODES: We did.

1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:39.440
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.120
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:43.680
We don't even know
what this is.

1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.240
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:49.040
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:51.680
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:56.040
Where's Fury?
