WEBVTT

01:09.120 --> 01:10.480
Longing

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Rusted

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
Seventeen

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Daybreak

01:17.240 --> 01:18.360
Furnace

01:19.720 --> 01:20.720
Nine

01:21.200 --> 01:22.680
Benign

01:23.760 --> 01:25.520
Homecoming

01:26.480 --> 01:27.560
One

01:29.480 --> 01:31.560
Freight car

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
Good morning, Soldier.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.960
Ready to comply.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.720
I have a mission for you.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.240
Sanction and extract.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.440
No witnesses.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.840
Well done Soldier.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.120
All right, what do you see?

03:22.280 --> 03:24.280
Standard beat cops.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.000
Small station.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.280
Quiet street.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.240
It's a good target.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.560
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?

03:34.720 --> 03:35.760
Cameras.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.600
Both cross streets
are one-way.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.360
So, compromised escape routes.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.920
STEVE: Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.040
He isn't afraid
to make a mess
on the way out.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.080
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?

03:46.280 --> 03:48.200
Yeah, the red one?
It's cute.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.440
It's also bulletproof,

03:49.520 --> 03:50.760
which means
private security...

03:50.840 --> 03:52.240
which means more guns...

03:52.400 --> 03:54.880
which means more headaches
for somebody. Probably us.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.520
You guys know
I can move things
with my mind, right?

03:57.680 --> 04:00.200
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.200
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.600
NATASHA: Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?

04:05.720 --> 04:06.960
STEVE: Eyes on target, folks.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.720
This is the best lead
we've had on Rumlow

04:08.800 --> 04:10.080
in six months.
I don't want to lose him.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.480
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.000
He kind of hates us.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.720
Sam...

04:18.880 --> 04:20.320
see that garbage truck?

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
Tag it.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.320
Give me X-ray.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.160
That truck's loaded
for max weight.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.320
And the driver's armed.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.560
It's a battering ram.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
STEVE: Go now.
What?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.080
He's not hitting the police.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.240
Body armor, AR-15s.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.960
I make seven hostiles.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.160
I make five.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.720
Sam.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.280
Four.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.080
Rumlow's on the third floor.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.640
Wanda, just like
we practiced.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.800
WANDA: What about the gas?

06:31.920 --> 06:32.960
Get it out.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.000
CROSSBONES: Pack it up.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.600
CROSSBONES: He's here.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.840
Rumlow has
a biological weapon.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.280
I'm on it.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.320
I don't work
like that no more.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
Fire in the hole.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.240
MERC: No!

08:48.080 --> 08:49.120
Sam.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.400
He's in an AFV
heading north.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.120
Take this to
the airstrip.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.320
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.760
Where are you
going to meet us?

09:08.920 --> 09:10.400
I'm not.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.480
I've got four,
they're splitting up.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.000
I got the two on the left.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.680
They ditched their gear.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.600
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.600
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.920
I've been waiting for this.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.480
He doesn't have it.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.080
I'm empty!

10:12.160 --> 10:13.480
Out of the way!

10:52.800 --> 10:54.080
Drop it.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
Or I'll drop this.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.040
Drop it!
He'll do it!

11:06.280 --> 11:08.200
Payload secure.
Thanks, Sam.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
Don't thank me.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.160
I'm not thanking that thing.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
His name is Redwing.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
I'm still not thanking it.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.920
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.760
Come on!

11:30.960 --> 11:33.040
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.320
Ahh!

11:55.280 --> 11:57.120
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.320
Who's your buyer?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.440
You know, he knew you.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.720
Your pal, your buddy,
your Bucky.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.240
What did you say?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.200
He remembered you.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.200
I was there.
He got all weepy about it.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.520
Till they put his brain
back in a blender.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.120
He wanted you
to know something.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.320
He said to me...

12:17.720 --> 12:19.840
"Please tell Rogers.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.760
"When you gotta go...

12:21.920 --> 12:23.680
"you gotta go."

12:25.960 --> 12:27.120
And you're coming with me.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.720
Oh, my...

12:48.440 --> 12:49.760
Sam...

12:51.640 --> 12:52.960
we need Fire and Rescue

12:53.040 --> 12:54.640
on the south side
of the building.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.720
We gotta get up there.

13:03.480 --> 13:10.240
the kind of September

13:15.080 --> 13:17.480
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye
to your father.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.280
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

13:20.760 --> 13:22.800
This is why
I love coming home
for Christmas...

13:22.960 --> 13:24.240
right before
you leave town.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.680
Be nice, dear,
he's been studying abroad.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.640
Really? Which broad?
What's her name?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.160
Candice.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.760
Do me a favor?

13:31.840 --> 13:33.360
Try not to burn
the house down
before Monday.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.680
Okay, so it's Monday.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.040
That is good to know,

13:36.120 --> 13:38.000
I will plan my toga party
accordingly.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.840
Where you going?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.080
Your father's flying us

13:41.160 --> 13:42.520
to the Bahamas
for a little getaway.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.200
We might have to make
a quick stop.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.440
At the Pentagon. Right?

13:46.520 --> 13:47.920
Don't worry,
you're gonna love

13:48.000 --> 13:49.600
the holiday menu
at the commissary.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.440
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.440
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.960
I'll get the bags.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.800
He does miss you
when you're not here.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.840
And frankly,
you're going to miss us.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.280
Because this is
the last time

14:08.360 --> 14:09.960
we're all going
to be together.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.280
You know
what's about to happen.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.240
Say something.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.360
If you don't,
you'll regret it.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.560
I love you, Dad.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.000
And I know you did
the best you could.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.800
That's how I wish
it happened.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.840
Binarily Augmented
Retro-Framing...

14:48.920 --> 14:50.040
or BARF.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.920
God, I gotta work
on that acronym.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.400
An extremely
costly method

14:54.480 --> 14:56.720
of hijacking
the hippocampus...

14:56.800 --> 15:00.880
clear traumatic memories.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.680
Huh.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.000
It doesn't change the fact

15:06.080 --> 15:07.920
that they never
made it to the airport...

15:08.560 --> 15:09.840
or all the things
I did to avoid

15:09.920 --> 15:11.680
processing my grief, but...

15:13.600 --> 15:17.920
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.680
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.520
Help me out, what's the
MIT mission statement?

15:26.680 --> 15:27.920
"To generate, disseminate...

15:29.320 --> 15:30.760
"and preserve knowledge.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.000
"And work with others...

15:33.120 --> 15:35.960
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."

15:36.920 --> 15:39.800
Well, you are the others.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.320
And, quiet as it's kept...

15:42.400 --> 15:44.080
the challenges facing you

15:44.160 --> 15:45.560
are the greatest
mankind's ever known.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.120
Plus, most of you are broke.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.400
Oh, I'm sorry.
Rather, you were.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.800
As of this moment...

15:51.960 --> 15:54.240
every student has been made
an equal recipient...

15:54.320 --> 15:57.320
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.920
As in...

15:59.320 --> 16:01.920
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.760
No strings, no taxes...

16:07.920 --> 16:10.080
just reframe the future!

16:10.240 --> 16:11.920
Starting now.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
Go break some eggs.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.240
Wow. Wow.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.040
That took my breath away.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.600
Oh, Tony!
So generous.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.960
So much money! Wow!

16:40.120 --> 16:41.880
Out of curiosity...

16:42.040 --> 16:44.840
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.280
I know, "Ooh, gross,"
but hear me out.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.600
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.760
Basically,
chemical detonator embedded...

16:49.840 --> 16:50.840
Restroom's this way, yeah?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.040
Yeah. Embedded
in the meat shaft.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.480
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.960
I didn't know Miss Potts
had canceled.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.800
They didn't have time
to fix it.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.360
It's fine.
I'll be right back.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.960
We'll catch up later.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.920
That was nice,
what you did for
those young people.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.080
Ah, they deserve it.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.400
Plus, it helps ease
my conscience.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.600
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.240
But if you've got the money...

17:38.160 --> 17:40.240
break as many eggs
as you like.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.400
Right?

17:51.160 --> 17:52.160
Are you going up?

17:52.560 --> 17:54.720
I'm right where
I want to be.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.320
Okay. Hey.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.560
Sorry,
it's an occupational hazard.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.360
I work for
the State Department.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.800
Human Resources.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.720
I know it's boring...

18:09.360 --> 18:12.640
but it enabled me
to raise a son.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.440
I'm very proud
of what he grew up to be.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.920
His name was Charlie Spencer.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.520
You murdered him.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.720
In Sokovia.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.280
Not that that matters
in the least to you.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.440
You think you fight for us?

18:37.560 --> 18:39.840
You just fight for yourself.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.560
Who's going to
avenge my son, Stark?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.760
He's dead...

18:47.920 --> 18:49.960
and I blame you.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.760
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
11 Wakandans were

18:59.840 --> 19:01.960
among those killed
during a confrontation...

19:02.040 --> 19:04.280
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...

19:04.360 --> 19:06.400
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.880
The traditionally reclusive
Wakandans

19:08.000 --> 19:09.320
were on an outreach mission...

19:09.400 --> 19:11.200
in Lagos,
when the attack occurred.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.600
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...

19:15.320 --> 19:18.360
not only because of
the actions of criminals...

19:18.520 --> 19:22.360
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.400
Victory at the expense
of the innocent...

19:25.680 --> 19:28.000
is no victory at all.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.640
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: The
Wakandan king went on to...

19:29.880 --> 19:31.320
They are operating outside

19:31.440 --> 19:33.160
and above
the international law.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.440
Because that's the reality,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.120
if we don't respond
to acts like these.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.240
What legal authority
does an enhanced

19:38.360 --> 19:40.120
individual like
Wanda Maximoff have...

19:40.240 --> 19:41.560
to operate in Nigeri...?

19:46.320 --> 19:47.640
It's my fault.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.800
That's not true.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.000
Turn the TV back on.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.160
They're being very specific.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.800
I should've clocked
that bomb vest

19:53.920 --> 19:55.840
long before you had
to deal with it.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.600
Rumlow said "Bucky"...

20:00.120 --> 20:01.920
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.080
in Brooklyn.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.920
And people died.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
It's on me.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.400
It's on both of us.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.840
This job...

20:19.920 --> 20:21.840
We try to save
as many people as we can.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.520
Sometimes that doesn't
mean everybody.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.600
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...

20:26.760 --> 20:28.680
then next time...

20:30.000 --> 20:31.800
maybe nobody gets saved.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.840
Vis! We talked about this.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.640
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...

20:42.360 --> 20:45.360
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr. Stark was arriving.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.040
Thank you.
We'll be right down.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.720
I'll use the door.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.040
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.880
STEVE: We know who it is?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.880
The Secretary of State.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.720
SECRETARY ROSS:
Five years ago...

21:02.120 --> 21:04.000
I had a heart attack...

21:04.160 --> 21:07.320
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.400
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...

21:10.560 --> 21:12.720
because after
13 hours of surgery

21:12.800 --> 21:14.560
and a triple bypass...

21:15.520 --> 21:17.400
I found something 40 years

21:17.480 --> 21:19.360
in the Army
had never taught me.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.240
Perspective.

21:23.360 --> 21:27.240
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.080
You have fought for us...

21:31.240 --> 21:34.240
protected us,
risked your lives...

21:34.400 --> 21:38.520
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...

21:38.680 --> 21:40.240
there are some...

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
who would prefer
the word "vigilantes."

21:44.240 --> 21:46.520
What word would you use,
Mr. Secretary?

21:46.680 --> 21:47.880
How about "dangerous"?

21:48.560 --> 21:51.280
What would you call
a group of US-based,

21:51.360 --> 21:53.440
enhanced individuals...

21:53.600 --> 21:56.600
who routinely ignore
sovereign borders...

21:56.760 --> 22:00.400
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...

22:00.560 --> 22:02.680
and who, frankly,
seem unconcerned

22:02.800 --> 22:04.120
about what they leave behind?

22:09.040 --> 22:10.640
New York.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.240
Washington, D.C.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.800
Sokovia.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.640
Lagos.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.680
Okay. That's enough.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.920
For the past four years,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.360
you've operated with
unlimited power...

23:03.520 --> 23:05.360
and no supervision.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.280
That's an arrangement
the governments of the world

23:07.360 --> 23:09.360
can no longer tolerate.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.280
But I think
we have a solution.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.360
The Sokovia Accords.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.640
Approved by 117 countries...

23:23.840 --> 23:26.680
it states that the Avengers

23:26.800 --> 23:29.360
shall no longer be
a private organization.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.720
Instead...

23:30.880 --> 23:33.040
they'll operate
under the supervision

23:33.120 --> 23:35.040
of a United Nations panel...

23:35.200 --> 23:39.680
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.720
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.400
I feel we've done that.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.640
Tell me, Captain,
do you know

23:47.720 --> 23:49.680
where Thor and Banner
are right now?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.520
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

23:53.680 --> 23:56.000
you can bet
there'd be consequences.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.680
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.720
Believe me,
this is the middle ground.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.480
So, there are contingencies.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.480
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

24:10.640 --> 24:12.640
to ratify the Accords.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.400
Talk it over.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.760
And if we come
to a decision
you don't like?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.440
Then you retire.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
MAN: Hello?

24:51.400 --> 24:53.440
Is this your car
out front?

24:55.080 --> 24:56.880
I jumped the curb.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.520
Maybe we could...

25:00.080 --> 25:01.640
take care of it ourselves.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...

25:03.960 --> 25:05.440
I guess.
No.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.880
No cops.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
Thank you.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.840
You have kept
your looks, Colonel.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
Congratulations.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.600
"Mission report.
December 16, 1991."

25:59.760 --> 26:01.200
Who are you?

26:02.440 --> 26:04.280
My name is Zemo.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.640
I will repeat my question.

26:08.280 --> 26:13.160
Mission report,
December 16, 1991.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.120
How did you find me?

26:15.280 --> 26:17.200
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...

26:17.360 --> 26:20.880
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.720
Millions of pages.
Much of it encrypted.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.520
Not easy to decipher.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.720
But, I have experience.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.200
And patience.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.680
A man can do anything
if he has those.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.960
What do you want?

26:40.160 --> 26:42.000
Mission report.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.000
December 16.

26:44.200 --> 26:45.720
1991.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.720
Go... to... hell!

27:03.920 --> 27:06.320
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ash heap.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.360
So your death
would not bother me.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.920
But I'd have to use
this book...

27:12.440 --> 27:15.600
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.960
I don't look forward to that.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.760
You'd only be dying for...

27:21.920 --> 27:23.400
your pride.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.600
Hail HYDRA.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.040
Secretary Ross has

27:53.120 --> 27:54.480
a Congressional
Medal of Honor...

27:54.560 --> 27:55.720
which is one more
than you have.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.560
SAM: So let's say
we agree to this thing.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.560
How long is it gonna be
before they LoJack us

27:59.640 --> 28:00.920
like a bunch
of common criminals?

28:01.080 --> 28:03.120
117 countries
want to sign this.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.840
117, Sam,
and you're just like,

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
"No, that's cool.
We got it."

28:06.000 --> 28:07.120
How long are you going
to play both sides?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.400
I have an equation.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
Oh, this will
clear it up.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.560
In the eight years
since Mr. Stark

28:12.640 --> 28:14.080
announced himself
as Iron Man...

28:14.160 --> 28:16.320
the number of known
enhanced persons

28:16.440 --> 28:17.760
has grown exponentially.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.640
During the same period...

28:20.840 --> 28:22.920
the number of potentially
world-ending events

28:23.000 --> 28:24.640
has risen
at a commensurate rate.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.080
Are you saying
it's our fault?

28:26.440 --> 28:28.920
I'm saying there may be
a causality.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.680
Our very strength
invites challenge.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.320
Challenge incites conflict.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.320
And conflict...

28:39.840 --> 28:42.080
breeds catastrophe.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.680
Oversight...

28:46.040 --> 28:49.200
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.360
Boom.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.360
NATASHA: Tony.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.840
You are being
uncharacteristically

28:54.000 --> 28:55.160
non-hyperverbal.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.520
It's because he's already
made up his mind.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.520
Boy, you know me so well.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.200
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.720
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.400
It's discomfort.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.640
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

29:11.320 --> 29:13.960
Am I running a bed and
breakfast for a biker gang?

29:20.200 --> 29:21.800
Oh, that's Charles Spencer,
by the way.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.360
He's a great kid.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.880
Computer engineering degree,
3.6 GPA...

29:27.040 --> 29:29.720
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.400
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...

29:32.560 --> 29:35.080
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.720
Maybe be of service.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.960
Charlie didn't want
to go to Vegas or

29:39.040 --> 29:40.480
Fort Lauderdale,
which is what I would do.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.240
He didn't go to
Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.360
He decided to
spend his summer

29:45.440 --> 29:47.000
building sustainable housing
for the poor.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.640
Guess where. Sokovia.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.760
He wanted to make
a difference, I suppose.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.200
We won't know
because we dropped

29:55.280 --> 29:57.560
a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.360
There's no decision-making
process here.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.360
We need to be put in check!

30:11.520 --> 30:13.880
Whatever form that takes,
I'm game.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.120
If we can't accept
limitations,

30:15.200 --> 30:16.200
if we're boundary-less...

30:16.280 --> 30:18.440
we're no better
than the bad guys.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.040
Tony, someone dies
on your watch,
you don't give up.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
Who said we're giving up?

30:22.200 --> 30:24.600
We are if we're not
taking responsibility
for our actions.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.600
This document
just shifts the blame.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.440
I'm sorry, Steve.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.280
That is dangerously arrogant.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.480
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.880
It's not the
World Security Council,

30:34.960 --> 30:36.200
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D.,
it's not HYDRA.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.640
No, but it's run by people

30:37.760 --> 30:39.120
with agendas,
and agendas change.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.080
That's good.
That's why I'm here.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.400
When I realized
what my weapons

30:42.480 --> 30:43.760
were capable of
in the wrong hands...

30:43.840 --> 30:45.520
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.920
Tony, you chose to do that.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.960
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.040
What if this panel
sends us somewhere

30:53.160 --> 30:54.320
we don't think we should go?

30:54.480 --> 30:55.760
What if there is somewhere
we need to go

30:55.840 --> 30:56.960
and they don't let us?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.640
We may not be perfect,

30:58.720 --> 31:00.440
but the safest hands
are still our own.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.000
If we don't do this now,

31:03.120 --> 31:04.800
it's gonna be
done to us later.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.840
That's the fact.
That won't be pretty.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.160
You're saying
they'll come for me.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.560
We would protect you.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.680
NATASHA: Maybe Tony's right.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.160
If we have one hand
on the wheel,

31:15.280 --> 31:17.360
we can still steer.
If we take it off...

31:17.440 --> 31:19.160
Aren't you the same woman
who told the government

31:19.240 --> 31:20.760
to kiss her ass
a few years ago?

31:20.840 --> 31:23.280
I'm just reading the terrain.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.640
We have made some
very public mistakes.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.840
We need to win
their trust back.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.120
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...

31:31.320 --> 31:33.280
or did you agree with me?
I want to take it back now.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.440
No, you can't retract it.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.480
Thank you.
Unprecedented.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.840
Okay. Case closed. I win.

31:41.280 --> 31:42.520
I have to go.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.160
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter

32:28.240 --> 32:30.000
to come up
and say a few words.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.160
Margaret Carter
was known to most

32:45.240 --> 32:46.760
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...

32:47.720 --> 32:49.880
but I just knew her
as Aunt Peggy.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.080
She had a photograph
in her office.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.280
Aunt Peggy
standing next to JFK.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.120
As a kid,
that was pretty cool.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.720
But it was a lot
to live up to.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.280
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.680
I asked her once
how she managed

33:08.800 --> 33:10.680
to master diplomacy
and espionage...

33:10.880 --> 33:13.320
in a time when
no one wanted to see

33:13.400 --> 33:15.200
a woman succeed at either.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.600
She said,
compromise where you can.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.640
But where you can't, don't.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.840
Even if everyone
is telling you

33:24.920 --> 33:28.080
that something wrong
is something right.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.520
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...

33:31.600 --> 33:35.320
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...

33:35.520 --> 33:39.960
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."

33:51.640 --> 33:53.840
When I came
out of the ice,

33:53.920 --> 33:56.320
I thought everyone
I had known was gone.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.280
Then I found out
she was alive.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.800
I was just lucky
to have her.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.760
She had you back, too.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.680
Who else signed?

34:08.520 --> 34:11.280
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.160
Clint?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.600
Says he's retired.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.520
Wanda?
TBD.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.000
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing
of the Accords.

34:22.200 --> 34:23.800
There's plenty of room
on the jet.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.520
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...

34:30.600 --> 34:32.880
doesn't mean
it's the wrong path.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.400
Staying together
is more important

34:34.480 --> 34:36.000
than how we stay together.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.880
What are we
giving up to do it?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.360
I'm sorry, Nat.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.200
I can't sign it.

34:47.680 --> 34:48.680
I know.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.560
Then what are
you doing here?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.680
I didn't want you
to be alone.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.560
Come here.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.080
MALE NEWS ANCHOR: At a special
United Nations conference...

35:14.160 --> 35:16.720
117 countries
have come together

35:16.800 --> 35:19.480
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.960
UN STAFFER: Excuse me,
Ms. Romanoff?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.640
NATASHA: Yes?
These need your signature.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.680
Thank you.
Thanks.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.320
T'CHALLA: I suppose
neither of us

35:32.440 --> 35:34.160
is used to the spotlight.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.600
Oh, well, it's not always
so flattering.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.080
You seem to be doing
all right so far.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.600
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...

35:43.120 --> 35:44.680
I wouldn't think
you'd be particularly

35:44.760 --> 35:46.600
comfortable in this company.

35:46.680 --> 35:47.800
Well, I'm not.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.720
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms. Romanoff.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.680
Why? You don't approve
of all this?

35:52.760 --> 35:56.200
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.120
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.560
Unless you need
to move a piano.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.120
Ms. Romanoff.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.280
King T'Chaka.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.200
Please, allow me to apologize
for what happened in Nigeria.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.920
Thank you.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.440
Thank you for agreeing
to all of this.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.200
I'm sad to hear
that Captain Rogers

36:16.320 --> 36:17.720
will not be joining us today.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.120
Yes, so am I.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.800
If everyone could
please be seated.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.640
This assembly
is now in session.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.760
That is the future calling.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.760
Such a pleasure.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.240
Thank you.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.840
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,

36:34.520 --> 36:36.440
you're getting quite good at it.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.600
I'm happy, Father.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.640
Thank you.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
Thank you.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.760
KING T'CHAKA: When stolen
Wakandan vibranium

36:49.840 --> 36:52.760
was used to make
a terrible weapon...

36:52.840 --> 36:56.800
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.680
Those men and women
killed in Nigeria...

36:59.840 --> 37:01.760
were part of
a goodwill mission

37:01.840 --> 37:04.000
from a country too long
in the shadows.

37:05.200 --> 37:09.440
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

37:09.520 --> 37:13.200
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.960
I am grateful
to the Avengers

37:16.040 --> 37:17.600
for supporting
this initiative.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.680
Wakanda is proud

37:21.840 --> 37:23.680
to extend its hand in peace.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
Everybody get down!

38:00.080 --> 38:02.800
SHARON: My mom tried to
talk me out of enlisting...

38:02.960 --> 38:04.400
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.760
She bought me
my first thigh holster.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.560
Very practical.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.280
And stylish.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.240
CIA has you stationed
over here now?

38:18.400 --> 38:20.160
Berlin.
Joint Terrorism Task Force.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.600
Right. Right.
Sounds fun.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.680
I know, right?

38:27.200 --> 38:29.480
I've been meaning
to ask you.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.800
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

38:32.960 --> 38:34.280
You mean when I was
doing my job.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.440
Did Peggy know?

38:40.880 --> 38:42.800
She kept so many secrets.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.280
I didn't want her
to have one from you.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.120
Thanks for walking me back.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.640
Sure.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.320
SAM: Steve.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.280
There's something
you gotta see.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.160
MALE NEWS ANCHOR:
A bomb hidden
in a news van...

39:01.360 --> 39:02.400
SHARON: Who's coordinating?

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.600
Good. They're solid.
Forensics?

39:04.680 --> 39:05.680
More than 70 people
have been injured.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.280
At least 12 are dead,

39:07.360 --> 39:09.640
including Wakanda's
King T'Chaka.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.640
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...

39:11.800 --> 39:14.240
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...

39:14.400 --> 39:15.800
the Winter Soldier.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.360
The infamous HYDRA agent...

39:17.520 --> 39:19.040
linked to numerous
acts of terrorism

39:19.160 --> 39:20.560
and political assassinations.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.240
I have to go to work.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.560
Call MI6, see
if we can get

39:29.680 --> 39:31.160
Micro Forensics
to hurry this up.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.560
We need the whole team
here in two hours

39:32.680 --> 39:33.760
or it's not worth it.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.360
I'm very sorry.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.720
T'CHALLA: In my culture...

39:54.080 --> 39:56.920
death is not the end.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.720
It's more of
a stepping-off point.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.320
You reach out
with both hands...

40:04.400 --> 40:06.640
and Bast and Sekhmet,

40:06.720 --> 40:09.360
they lead you
into the green veldt...

40:10.240 --> 40:12.080
where you can run forever.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.080
That sounds very peaceful.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.720
My father thought so.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.400
I am not my father.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.080
T'Challa...

40:24.240 --> 40:27.040
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.400
Don't bother, Ms. Romanoff.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.000
I'll kill him myself.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.400
Yeah?

40:41.480 --> 40:42.720
You all right?

40:42.880 --> 40:45.720
Uh, yeah, thanks.
I got lucky.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.120
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.

40:56.240 --> 40:59.320
Stay home.
You'll only make this worse.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.840
For all of us.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.000
Please.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.160
Are you saying
you'll arrest me?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.800
No.

41:05.920 --> 41:06.960
Someone will.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.440
If you interfere.
That's how it works now.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.040
If he's this far gone, Nat,

41:11.120 --> 41:12.640
I should be the one
to bring him in.

41:12.760 --> 41:13.800
Why?

41:13.920 --> 41:16.680
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.520
Shit.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.840
She tell you
to stay out of it?

41:27.600 --> 41:28.600
Might have a point.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.960
He'd do it for me.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.600
1945, maybe.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.480
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.040
The people that shoot at you

41:36.120 --> 41:37.840
usually wind up
shooting at me.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.440
Tips have been pouring in

41:41.520 --> 41:42.960
since that footage
went public.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.000
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier
goes to their gym.

41:45.480 --> 41:46.960
Most of it's noise.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.480
Except for this.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.720
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...

41:52.880 --> 41:55.000
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.160
Thank you.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.000
SHARON: You're
gonna have to hurry.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.680
We have orders
to shoot on sight.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.480
Homecoming

42:11.160 --> 42:12.240
One

42:12.800 --> 42:13.760
One

42:18.840 --> 42:20.960
Freight car

42:32.520 --> 42:34.120
I have your breakfast.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.960
I could smell it before I opened the door.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.000
Side of bacon and black coffee.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.280
Again.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.240
I can make you something different, if you like.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.480
This is wonderful...

42:46.720 --> 42:47.920
I will just put this on your...

42:48.000 --> 42:49.560
It's okay, I can manage!

44:23.160 --> 44:24.200
Heads up, Cap.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.680
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.680
Understood.

44:37.640 --> 44:38.640
Do you know me?

44:41.640 --> 44:43.040
You're Steve.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.240
I read about you in a museum.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.480
SAM: They've set
the perimeter.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.040
I know you're nervous,

44:51.160 --> 44:52.800
and you have
plenty of reason to be.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.240
But you're lying.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.320
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.640
They're entering
the building.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.240
Well, the people
who think you did
are coming here now.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.160
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.840
That's smart.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.160
Good strategy.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.200
They're on the roof.
I'm compromised.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.160
This doesn't have to
end in a fight, Buck.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.200
It always ends
in a fight.
Five seconds.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.840
You pulled me
from the river.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.360
Why?

45:28.240 --> 45:30.000
I don't know.
Three seconds.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.880
Yes, you do.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.280
Breach! Breach! Breach!

45:54.720 --> 45:55.800
Buck, stop!

45:56.400 --> 45:57.640
You're gonna kill someone.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.640
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.120
Suspect has broken containment!

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
...he's headed down the east stairwell!

47:01.960 --> 47:03.040
Come on, man.

47:24.960 --> 47:25.960
Ahhh!

48:08.000 --> 48:09.440
Sam, southwest rooftop.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.880
SAM: Who the hell's
the other guy?

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
About to find out.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.680
Sam.
Got him.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
Stand down!

49:12.480 --> 49:13.480
Stand down!

49:42.440 --> 49:43.920
Sam, I can't shake this guy.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.360
Right behind you.

51:20.240 --> 51:22.560
Stand down, now.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.280
Congratulations, Cap.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.040
You're a criminal.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.240
Your Highness.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.600
"A pinch of paprika."

52:05.760 --> 52:06.760
A pinch.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.480
Is that paprikash?

52:12.640 --> 52:15.920
I thought it might
lift your spirits.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.160
Spirits lifted.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.640
In my defense,

52:34.800 --> 52:37.680
I haven't actually ever eaten
anything before, so...

52:37.760 --> 52:39.040
May I?

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
Please.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.560
Wanda?
Hmm.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.640
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.040
Thanks.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.160
Oh, you're welcome.

52:55.280 --> 52:58.640
No, it's a involuntary
response in their amygdala.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.800
They can't help
but be afraid of you.

53:00.960 --> 53:01.960
Are you?

53:02.040 --> 53:04.040
My amygdala
is synthetic, so...

53:07.520 --> 53:10.120
I used to think
of myself one way.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.320
But after this...

53:14.720 --> 53:16.880
I am something else.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.840
I'm still me,
I think, but...

53:22.840 --> 53:25.480
that's not what
everyone else sees.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.240
Do you know,
I don't know what this is?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.840
Not really.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.920
I know it's not
of this world...

53:35.000 --> 53:36.440
that it powered Loki's staff,

53:36.520 --> 53:38.760
gave you your abilities,
but...

53:40.160 --> 53:43.520
its true nature is a mystery.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.760
And yet, it is part of me.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.040
Are you afraid of it?

53:47.720 --> 53:50.080
I wish to understand it.

53:50.240 --> 53:52.400
The more I do,
the less it controls me.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.520
One day... who knows?

53:55.680 --> 53:57.120
I may even control it.

53:59.880 --> 54:03.680
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.560
I'm gonna go
to the store.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.200
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

54:09.360 --> 54:12.120
Alternatively,
we could order a pizza?

54:13.600 --> 54:16.560
Vision, are you not
letting me leave?

54:18.440 --> 54:19.960
It is a question of safety.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.080
I can protect myself.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.880
Not yours.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.160
Mr. Stark would like to
avoid the possibility

54:29.240 --> 54:31.040
of another public incident.

54:31.560 --> 54:35.640
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.

54:38.120 --> 54:40.160
And what do you want?

54:41.240 --> 54:42.720
For people to see you...

54:43.600 --> 54:45.120
as I do.

55:18.120 --> 55:19.120
So, you like cats?

55:19.280 --> 55:21.120
Sam.
SAM: What?

55:21.280 --> 55:22.400
Dude shows up
dressed like a cat,

55:22.480 --> 55:23.760
you don't wanna know more?

55:26.080 --> 55:27.800
Your suit...
it's vibranium?

55:31.320 --> 55:33.520
The Black Panther
has been the protector

55:33.640 --> 55:35.600
of Wakanda for generations.

55:36.640 --> 55:39.800
A mantle, passed from
warrior to warrior.

55:41.600 --> 55:44.360
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

55:45.480 --> 55:47.840
I also wear
the mantle of king.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.000
So, I ask you...

55:50.080 --> 55:53.120
as both warrior and king...

55:54.320 --> 55:58.040
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

56:17.840 --> 56:19.160
What's gonna
happen to him?

56:19.320 --> 56:21.520
Same thing that ought
to happen to you.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.840
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.840
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.

56:26.520 --> 56:27.560
What about a lawyer?

56:27.720 --> 56:29.400
Lawyer. That's funny.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.520
See their weapons
are placed in lockup.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.560
We'll write you a receipt.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.280
I better not
look out the window

56:35.360 --> 56:37.400
and see anybody
flying around in that.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.680
EVERETT: You'll be
provided with an office

56:44.800 --> 56:46.160
instead of a cell.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.360
Now, do me a favor,
stay in it?

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
I don't intend
on going anywhere.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.040
For the record,
this is what

56:53.120 --> 56:55.040
making things worse
looks like.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.360
He's alive.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.040
TONY: No.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.400
Romania was not
Accords-sanctioned.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.200
Colonel Rhodes is
supervising cleanup.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.320
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

57:04.520 --> 57:06.880
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.640
Obviously you can
quote me on that,

57:08.720 --> 57:10.280
because I just said it.
Anything else?

57:10.440 --> 57:11.520
Thank you, sir.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.000
"Consequences"?

57:14.200 --> 57:15.400
Secretary Ross
wants you both prosecuted.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.760
Had to give him something.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.400
I'm not getting
that shield back, am I?

57:18.880 --> 57:20.120
Technically, it's the
government's property.

57:20.240 --> 57:21.440
Wings, too.

57:21.720 --> 57:22.760
That's cold.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.240
Warmer than jail.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.040
TONY: Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

57:54.800 --> 57:56.960
I pulled something
from Dad's archives.

57:58.440 --> 57:59.800
Felt timely.

58:04.080 --> 58:07.640
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

58:08.120 --> 58:11.000
Provided support
to the Allies when
they needed it most.

58:11.160 --> 58:13.320
Some would say it
brought our country
closer to war.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.400
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

58:19.080 --> 58:21.600
I'm trying to...
What do you call it?

58:21.760 --> 58:23.680
That's an olive branch.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.000
Is that what you call it?

58:27.480 --> 58:29.920
Is Pepper here?
I didn't see her.

58:31.120 --> 58:33.480
We're kinda...

58:34.120 --> 58:35.800
Well, not kinda...
Pregnant?

58:36.160 --> 58:37.640
No. Definitely not.

58:37.800 --> 58:39.640
We're taking a break.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.200
It's nobody's fault.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.280
I'm so sorry, Tony.
I didn't know.

58:44.960 --> 58:46.440
A few years ago,
I almost lost her,

58:46.520 --> 58:48.000
so I trashed all my suits.

58:48.960 --> 58:50.800
Then, we had to mop up
HYDRA...

58:51.000 --> 58:53.320
and then Ultron. My fault.

58:53.480 --> 58:56.640
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

58:56.840 --> 58:59.320
Because the truth is
I don't wanna stop.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.680
I don't wanna lose her.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.640
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.200
In her defense,
I'm a handful.

59:12.480 --> 59:14.880
Yet, Dad was
a pain in the ass,

59:15.000 --> 59:16.800
but he and Mom
always made it work.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.400
STEVE: I'm glad
Howard got married.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.040
I only knew him
when he was young
and single.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.160
Oh, really?
You two knew each other?

59:23.240 --> 59:24.640
He never mentioned that.

59:24.800 --> 59:27.400
Maybe only a
thousand times.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.560
God, I hated you.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.040
I don't mean to
make things difficult.

59:33.200 --> 59:35.520
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.400
If I see a situation
pointed south...

59:39.240 --> 59:40.840
I can't ignore it.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.360
Sometimes I wish I could.

59:42.560 --> 59:43.600
No, you don't.

59:46.560 --> 59:48.040
No, I don't.

59:48.760 --> 59:49.760
Sometimes...

59:49.920 --> 59:53.000
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your
perfect teeth.

59:53.720 --> 59:55.160
But I don't wanna
see you gone.

59:55.760 --> 59:57.560
We need you, Cap.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.040
So far, nothing's happened

59:59.120 --> 1:00:01.040
that can't be undone,
if you sign.

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:03.720
We can make
the last 24 hours legit.

1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:06.200
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-center...

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.240
instead of a Wakandan prison.

1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:21.600
I'm not saying
it's impossible...

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:23.720
but there would
have to be safeguards.

1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:24.920
Sure.

1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:26.720
Once we put out the PR fire,

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.800
those documents
can be amended.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:30.880
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:32.880
Wanda? What about Wanda?

1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:34.600
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:35.920
Vision's keeping her company.

1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:37.280
Oh, God, Tony.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:39.600
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:40.800
It's 100 acres
with a lap pool.

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:41.880
It's got a screening room.

1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:43.120
There's worse ways
to protect people.

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:44.280
Protection?

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.080
Is that how
you see this?

1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:48.240
This is protection?
It's internment, Tony.

1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:49.680
She's not a US citizen.
Oh, come on, Tony.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.320
And they don't grant
visas to weapons of
mass destruction.

1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:52.360
She's a kid!

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.000
Give me a break!

1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:57.120
I'm doing what
has to be done.

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.080
To stave off
something worse.

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.120
You keep
telling yourself that.

1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:08.600
Hate to break up the set.

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.800
HELMUT ZEMO:
Hello, Mr. Barnes.

1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.840
I've been sent by
the United Nations
to evaluate you.

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.320
Do you mind if I sit?

1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:29.840
Your first name is James?

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:33.280
The receipt
for your gear.

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:36.800
"Bird costume"?
Come on.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.640
I didn't write it.

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:46.320
HELMUT ZEMO:
I'm not here to judge you.

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:48.200
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:52.200
Do you know
where you are, James?

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:58.160
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.

1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:00.680
My name is Bucky.

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:11.160
Hello?

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:19.320
Hey!

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:40.880
Why would the Task Force

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:42.520
release this photo
to begin with?

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:45.200
Get the word out, involve
as many eyes as we can?

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:48.240
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.400
Set off a bomb,
get your picture taken.

1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:51.600
Get seven billion people
looking

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:52.680
for the Winter Soldier.

1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:54.600
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?

1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:55.760
Steve, we looked
for the guy for two years

1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:56.880
and found nothing.

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.040
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:00.440
SHARON: Yeah,
but that doesn't guarantee

1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:01.680
that whoever
framed him would get him.

1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.600
It guarantees that we would.

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:10.800
Yeah.

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:14.960
HELMUT ZEMO:
Tell me, Bucky.

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:17.600
You've seen a great deal,
haven't you?

1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:21.040
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:24.360
You fear that if you
open your mouth,

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:26.240
the horrors
might never stop.

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:30.960
Don't worry.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.440
We only have
to talk about one.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.640
Come on, guys,
get me eyes on Barnes.

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:06.000
Friday,
get me a source
on that outage.

1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:09.440
Sub-level five,
East Wing.

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:14.320
What the hell is this?

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.160
Why don't we
discuss your home?

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:19.320
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:23.880
I mean your real home.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:31.400
Longing

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:33.000
No.

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:34.720
Rusted

1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:36.320
Stop.

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:37.640
Seventeen

1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:41.280
Stop.

1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:44.320
Daybreak

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:51.600
Furnace

1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:55.160
Nine

1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.400
Benign

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:04.440
Homecoming

1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:06.200
One

1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:08.640
Freight car

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.320
Soldier?

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:30.560
Ready to comply.

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:37.120
Mission report.
December 16, 1991.

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:49.120
HELMUT ZEMO: Help me.

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:50.720
Help.

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:54.880
Get up.

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.080
Who are you?
What do you want?

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:03.560
To see an empire fall.

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:36.560
Hey.

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:44.680
EVERETT: Evac all civilians.

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:45.920
Get me a perimeter
around the building,

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.120
and gunships in the air.

1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:48.800
Please tell me
you brought a suit.

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.000
Sure did.
It's a lovely Tom Ford,

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:51.440
three-piece,
two-button.

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:53.120
I'm an active-duty
non-combatant.

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:55.120
Follow me.

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:12.840
We're in position.

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:47.400
You could at least
recognize me.

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:41.760
Damn it.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.200
WOMAN: He asked me again
if you were going to be there.

1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:23.280
I said I wasn't sure.

1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:26.200
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:28.560
I'm going to bed.

1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.160
I love you.

1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:37.720
James Barnes the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing...

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:39.320
...escaped custody today.

1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:42.520
...also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:43.640
and Sam Wilson.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.040
SAM: Hey, Cap!

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:22.920
Steve.

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:26.160
Which Bucky am I
talking to?

1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:29.840
Your mom's name was Sarah.

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:37.200
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:39.840
Can't read that
in a museum.

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.720
Just like that,
we're supposed to be cool?

1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:43.400
What did I do?

1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:44.480
Enough.

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:46.360
Oh, God,
I knew this would happen.

1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.800
Everything HYDRA
put inside me
is still there.

1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:50.920
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.

1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:52.720
Who was he?
I don't know.

1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:54.960
People are dead.
The bombing, the setup...

1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:57.400
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.

1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.360
I need you to
do better than
"I don't know."

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:05.760
He wanted to know
about Siberia.

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:10.120
Where I was kept.

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:13.680
He wanted to know
exactly where.

1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:16.160
Why would he need
to know that?

1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:20.560
Because I'm not
the only Winter Soldier.

1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:15.880
It hurts!

1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:55.680
Good work.

1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:07.440
Get me out of here.

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:22.360
Who were they?

1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:24.120
BUCKY: Their most
elite death squad.

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:26.400
More kills than anyone
in HYDRA history.

1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:27.840
And that was
before the serum.

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.120
They all turn out
like you?

1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:30.440
Worse.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.840
The doctor,
could he control them?

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:35.200
Enough.

1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:37.200
Said he wanted
to see an empire fall.

1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:39.040
BUCKY: With these guys,
he could do it.

1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:41.600
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:44.000
infiltrate, assassinate,
destabilize.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:45.600
They can take
a whole country down

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:47.160
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:51.920
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:54.640
If we call Tony...
No, he won't believe us.

1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:55.720
Even if he did...

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.600
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:00.040
We're on our own.

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.480
Maybe not.

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:05.960
I know a guy.

1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:09.840
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:10.920
TONY: We will.

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.680
GSG 9's got
the borders covered.

1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.560
Recon's flying 24/7.

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:16.160
They'll get a hit.
We'll handle it.

1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:18.080
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:20.640
It's clear
you can't be objective.

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:22.320
I'm putting
Special Ops on this.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.640
What happens when
the shooting starts?

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:25.040
What, do you kill
Steve Rogers?

1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:26.440
SECRETARY ROSS:
If we're provoked.

1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:28.240
Barnes would've been
eliminated

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:29.920
in Romania
if it wasn't for Rogers.

1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:33.880
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:36.760
Feel free to check my math.

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:38.320
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:39.680
with boys and bullets, Ross.

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:40.960
You gotta let us
bring them in.

1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:43.040
How would that end any
differently than last time?

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:44.240
Because this time,

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:46.080
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.160
72 hours, guaranteed.

1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:51.160
36 hours.

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:54.000
Barnes.

1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:56.840
Rogers.

1:15:57.560 --> 1:15:58.560
Wilson.

1:15:58.640 --> 1:15:59.840
Thank you, sir.

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:06.040
My left arm is numb.
Is that normal?

1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:10.520
You all right?

1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:11.760
Always.

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:18.120
36 hours. Jeez.

1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:20.320
We're seriously understaffed.

1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:21.680
Oh, yeah.

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:24.880
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now.
Any shot?

1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:29.360
You really think
he'd be on our side?

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:30.600
No.

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:31.960
I have an idea.

1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:34.560
Me, too. Where's yours?

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:36.520
Downstairs.

1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:37.840
Where's yours?

1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:02.520
MAY: Mmm. Hey.

1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:06.400
How was school today?

1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:07.840
PETER: It was okay.

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.280
This crazy car
parked outside.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:15.520
Oh, Mr. Parker.
Um...

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:19.800
What are you doing...

1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:21.760
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.

1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:23.200
Tony.

1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:25.240
What are you doing here?

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:26.680
It's about time we met.

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:28.480
You've been getting
my emails, right?

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.280
Yeah. Yeah.
Right?

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:31.480
Regarding the...

1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:32.560
You didn't even tell me
about the grant.

1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:34.200
About the grant.
The September Foundation.

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:35.360
Right.
Yeah.

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:36.440
Remember when
you applied?

1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:37.560
Yeah.

1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:40.200
I approved,
so now we're
in business.

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:42.880
But you didn't
tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:44.120
You keeping secrets
from me now?

1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:46.160
I just know how much
you love surprises

1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:48.080
so I thought I would
let you know...

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:50.240
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:51.320
That's what I'm here
to hash out.

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:52.880
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:55.680
It's so hard for me
to believe that she's
someone's aunt.

1:17:55.840 --> 1:17:58.160
Yeah, well,
we come in all shapes
and sizes, you know?

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:00.720
This walnut date loaf
is exceptional.

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.280
Let me just stop you there.
Yeah.

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:06.240
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:07.640
TONY: Yeah,
it's pretty well funded.

1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:08.880
Yeah? Wow.

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:10.600
Look who you're
talking to.

1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:11.760
Can I have five minutes
with him?

1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:12.880
Sure.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:22.040
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:26.120
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.000
Thrift store?
Salvation Army?

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.080
Uh, the garbage, actually.
You're a dumpster diver?

1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:31.360
Yeah, I was...

1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:33.000
Anyway, look, um,

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:34.640
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.440
Ah-ah! Me first.
Okay.

1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:39.000
Quick question of
the rhetorical variety.

1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.320
That's you, right?

1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:43.680
Um, no.

1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:45.400
What do you mean?
Yeah.

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:47.920
Look at you go.

1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:51.240
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds,
40 miles an hour.

1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:54.160
That's not easy.
You got mad skills.

1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:56.240
That's all on YouTube,
though, right?

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:57.840
That's where you found that?

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.040
Because you know
that's all fake.

1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:00.160
It's all done
on the computer.

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:01.400
Mmm-hmm.

1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:03.560
It's like that video.
What is it?

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:05.520
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:06.840
Exactly.

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:08.240
Oh, what have we here?

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.400
Uh...

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:19.280
You're the Spider-ling.

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.360
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:25.760
Spider-Man.

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:27.960
Not in that onesie,
you're not.

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:30.440
It's not a onesie.

1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:33.160
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.040
a really good day today,
Mr. Stark.

1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:36.560
Didn't miss my train,
this perfectly good

1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:38.360
DVD player
was just sitting there...

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.600
and Algebra test,
nailed it.

1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:43.960
Who else knows? Anybody?

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:46.560
Nobody.

1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:48.960
Not even your unusually
attractive aunt?

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:50.400
No. No.

1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:53.160
No! If she knew,
she would freak out.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:55.040
And when she freaks out,
I freak out.

1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:57.320
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:01.000
That tensile strength
is off the charts.

1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:02.480
Who manufactured that?

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:03.960
I did.

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:06.640
Climbing walls,
how you doing that?

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:08.040
Adhesive gloves?

1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:09.520
It's a long story. I was...

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:12.360
Lordy! Can you even
see in these?

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:13.520
Yes, I can.

1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:14.840
I'm blind!

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:17.400
I can see in those.

1:20:17.480 --> 1:20:18.480
Okay?

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:20.920
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.280
it's like my senses
have been dialed to 11.

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:26.040
There's way too much input,

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:28.120
so they just kinda
help me focus.

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:30.640
You're in dire need
of an upgrade.

1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:33.200
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:34.280
That's why I'm here.

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:38.400
Why you doing this?

1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:41.000
I gotta know,
what's your MO?

1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:42.440
What gets you
outta that twin bed
in the morning?

1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:44.840
Because...

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.840
Because I've been me
my whole life,

1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:52.600
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:54.240
Mmm-hmm.

1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:56.680
I read books,
I build computers.

1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:00.560
Yeah, I would love
to play football,

1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:02.200
but I couldn't then,
so I shouldn't now.

1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:03.960
Sure,
because you're different.

1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:06.560
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:15.040
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.360
and then the bad things
happen...

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:22.000
they happen because of you.

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:27.920
So you wanna look out
for the little guy,

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:29.200
you wanna do your part?

1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:31.600
Make the world
a better place,
all that, right?

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:34.320
Yeah, just looking out
for the little guy.

1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:36.960
That's what it is.

1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:46.400
I'm gonna sit here,
so you move the leg.

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.560
You got a passport?

1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.000
No, I don't even have
a driver's license.

1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.560
You ever been to Germany?
No.

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:00.760
Oh, you'll love it.

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:02.840
I can't go to Germany.
Why?

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:06.560
I got homework.

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:09.080
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.280
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop
out of school.

1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:12.520
Might be
a little dangerous.

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.480
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm
taking you on a field trip.

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.160
Don't tell Aunt May.

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:21.120
All right,
Spider-Man.

1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:25.920
Get me out of this.

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.200
Sorry. I'll get the...

1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:41.280
What is it?

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:42.880
Stay here, please.

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:51.000
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:54.600
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.320
Disappointing my kids.

1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:02.360
I'm supposed to go
waterskiing.

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:04.640
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.000
Clint!

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:09.240
You should not be here.

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:12.840
Really?

1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:15.080
I retire for, what,
like five minutes,

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.200
and it all
goes to shit.

1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.760
Please consider
the consequences
of your actions.

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:19.960
Okay, they're considered.

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.800
Okay, we gotta go.

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:28.560
It's this way.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.920
I've caused
enough problems.

1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:36.960
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:38.840
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.160
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:43.240
Shit.

1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:51.400
I knew I should've stretched.

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.520
VISION: Clint,
you can't overpower me.

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:09.520
I know I can't.

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.680
But she can.

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:16.280
Vision, that's enough.
Let him go.

1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:18.160
I'm leaving.

1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:19.480
I can't let you.

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:25.840
I'm sorry.

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.200
If you do this...

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:34.640
they will never stop
being afraid of you.

1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:39.520
I can't control their fear,
only my own.

1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:52.920
CLINT: Oh...

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:57.200
Come on. We got
one more stop.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.760
ATTACHE: It's just
a matter of time.

1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:02.680
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:04.400
and behavioral pattern scans.

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.120
Move or you will be moved.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:15.080
As entertaining
as that would be...

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.400
You really think
you can find him?

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:19.560
My resources are
considerable.

1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:22.120
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:24.720
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:27.600
You know where they are.

1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:29.840
I know someone who does.

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:35.040
Not sure you
understand the concept
of a getaway car.

1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:36.240
It's low profile.

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:39.600
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.920
Can you move
your seat up?

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.160
No.

1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:45.560
I owe you again.

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:47.720
Keeping a list.

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:52.640
You know, he kinda
tried to kill me.

1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.240
Sorry. I'll put it
on the list, too.

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.840
They're going to come
looking for you.

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.040
I know.

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:07.040
Thank you, Sharon.

1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:23.600
That was...

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:24.760
Late.

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:25.920
Damn right.

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:31.280
I should go.

1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:32.440
Okay.

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.160
Cap.

1:26:58.320 --> 1:26:59.400
You know I wouldn't
have called

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:00.560
if I had any other choice.

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:02.000
Hey, man,
you're doing me a favor.

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:04.520
Besides, I owe a debt.

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:06.240
Thanks for having
my back.

1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:07.920
It was time to
get off my ass.

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.120
How about our
other recruit?

1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:11.840
He's rarin' to go.

1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:13.840
Had to put a little
coffee in him...

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:16.360
but he should be good.

1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:21.200
What time zone is this?

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.200
Come on. Come on.

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:28.240
Captain America!
Mr. Lang.

1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:30.400
It's an honor.

1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.600
I'm shaking
your hand too long.

1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:34.000
Wow! This is awesome!

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:36.800
Captain America.
I know you, too.
You're great!

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:41.560
Jeez.

1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:43.520
Ah, look, I wanna say,

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:45.680
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:48.480
thinks for thanking of me.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:50.520
Hey, man!
What's up, Tic Tac?

1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:51.680
Uh, good to see you.

1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:53.200
Look, what happened
last time when I...

1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:56.600
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

1:27:56.960 --> 1:27:59.040
They tell you what
we're up against?

1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:02.400
Something about
some psycho-assassins?

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:04.720
We're outside the law
on this one.

1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.840
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:08.800
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:10.000
We should get moving.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:11.880
We got a chopper lined up.

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:18.200
They're evacuating
the airport.

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:19.480
Stark.

1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:20.640
Stark?

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.600
Suit up.

1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:45.240
IRON MAN: Wow, it's so weird

1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:46.320
how you run
into people at the airport.

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.040
Don't you think that's weird?
Definitely weird.

1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:49.400
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Hear me out, Tony.

1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:52.440
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:57.000
Captain.

1:28:57.160 --> 1:28:58.200
Your Highness.

1:28:58.680 --> 1:28:59.680
IRON MAN: Anyway...

1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:02.120
Ross gave me 36 hours
to bring you in.

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:05.200
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:06.720
You're after
the wrong guy.

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.960
Your judgment is askew.

1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:11.520
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:14.520
And there are five
more super soldiers
just like him.

1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:17.160
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony.
I can't.

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:18.400
BLACK WIDOW: Steve...

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:21.480
you know what's
about to happen.

1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:24.000
Do you really wanna punch
your way out of this one?

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000
All right, I've run out
of patience.

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:31.160
Underoos!

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.840
Nice job, kid.
Thanks.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.840
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.840
New suit.
It's nothing, Mr. Stark.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.160
It's perfect. Thank you.

1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:46.000
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:47.200
Okay. Cap. Captain.

1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:49.720
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.

1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:51.000
Yeah, we'll talk
about it later.

1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:52.760
Hey, everyone.
Good job.

1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:54.240
You've been busy.

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:56.440
And you've been
a complete idiot.

1:29:56.520 --> 1:29:57.560
Dragging in Clint...

1:29:57.680 --> 1:29:59.120
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place

1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:01.360
she doesn't even want
to leave, a safe place.

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:02.720
I'm trying to keep...

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:07.120
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:09.880
You did that
when you signed.

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.040
All right, we're done.

1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:14.200
You're gonna turn Barnes over,

1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:16.560
you're gonna come with us,
now, because it's us...

1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:18.360
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:21.200
with no compunction
about being impolite.

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:24.400
Come on.

1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:27.080
FALCON: We found it.

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:30.560
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:35.720
All right, Lang.

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.320
Hey, guys, something...

1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:40.200
What the hell was that?

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:42.400
I believe this is yours,
Captain America.

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:43.560
Oh, great.

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:44.960
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:46.400
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.

1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:47.960
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?

1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:50.160
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.

1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:51.320
Barnes is mine.

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:54.120
Hey, Mr. Stark,
what should I do?

1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:55.200
What we discussed.

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:56.280
Keep your distance,
web them up.

1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:57.600
Okay, copy that.

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:03.960
Move, Captain.

1:31:04.120 --> 1:31:05.920
I won't ask a second time.

1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:09.680
Look, I really don't
want to hurt you.

1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:11.680
I wouldn't stress about it.

1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:25.280
What the hell
is that?

1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:27.480
Everyone's got
a gimmick now.

1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:35.440
You have a metal arm?

1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:37.120
That is awesome, dude.

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:40.280
You have the right
to remain silent!

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:56.320
Sorry, Cap,
this won't kill you...

1:31:56.480 --> 1:31:57.720
but it ain't gonna
tickle either.

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:05.040
Wanda, I think you hurt
Vision's feelings.

1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:06.560
You locked me
in my room.

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:08.160
Okay, first,
that's an exaggeration.

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:10.640
Second, I did it
to protect you.

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:12.160
Hey, Clint.
Hey, man.

1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:14.040
Clearly,
retirement doesn't suit you.

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.680
You got tired of
shooting golf?

1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:18.200
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:20.320
Just can't seem to miss.

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:24.240
First time for everything.

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:25.520
Made you look.

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.680
FRIDAY: Multiple
contusions detected.

1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:39.520
Yeah, I detected that, too.

1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:48.400
Oh, God!

1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:51.360
Hey, buddy,
I think you lost this!

1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:58.040
Ahh!

1:33:03.400 --> 1:33:04.720
Those wings carbon fiber?

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:06.200
Is this stuff
coming out of you?

1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:07.960
That would explain the
rigidity-flexibility ratio,

1:33:08.040 --> 1:33:09.480
which, gotta say,
that's awesome, man.

1:33:09.640 --> 1:33:11.200
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...

1:33:11.360 --> 1:33:12.880
but there's usually
not this much talking.

1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:14.040
All right, sorry.
My bad.

1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:20.880
Guys, look,
I'd love to
keep this up,

1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:22.600
but I've only got
one job here today...

1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:25.720
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.

1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:31.400
You couldn't have
done that earlier?

1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:33.160
I hate you.

1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:40.640
Great.

1:33:40.840 --> 1:33:42.400
Hey, Cap, heads-up!

1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:45.320
Throw it at this.

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:46.960
Now!

1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:51.760
Oh, come on!

1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:57.520
Oh, man,
I thought it was
a water truck.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:33:59.600
Uh, sorry.

1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:03.000
All right,
now I'm pissed.

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:05.200
Is this part
of the plan?

1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:06.880
Well, my plan was
go easy on them.

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:08.200
You wanna switch it up?

1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:11.760
There's our ride.

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:15.000
Come on!

1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:25.120
Captain Rogers...

1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:29.120
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:31.720
But for the collective good...

1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:34.200
you must surrender now.

1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:53.000
FALCON: What do we do, Cap?

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.200
We fight.

1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:58.640
This is gonna end well.

1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:06.720
They're not stopping.

1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:07.920
Neither are we.

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:40.080
We're still friends, right?

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:41.760
Depends on how hard
you hit me.

1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:52.560
You were pulling
your punches.

1:35:56.880 --> 1:35:58.200
I didn't kill
your father.

1:35:58.400 --> 1:35:59.680
Then why did you run?

1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:20.280
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:21.360
Look, kid, there's
a lot going on here

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:22.440
that you don't understand.

1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:24.240
Mr. Stark said
you'd say that. Wow.

1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:35.640
He also said to go
for your legs.

1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:44.080
Ahhh!

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:48.760
Clint, can you get him off me?

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.080
Buckled in?

1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:51.640
ANT-MAN: Yeah.
No, I'm good.

1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:53.840
I'm good, Arrow Guy.
Let's go!

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:16.960
Stark tell you
anything else?

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:19.800
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:21.880
That makes you dangerous.

1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:28.360
Guess he had a point.

1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:35.480
You got heart, kid.
Where you from?

1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:37.520
Queens.

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:40.000
Brooklyn.

1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:46.960
Friday?

1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:48.240
FRIDAY: We have some
weapon systems offline.

1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:49.320
What?

1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:52.040
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.

1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:53.520
Who's speaking?

1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:57.400
It's your conscience. We don't
talk a lot these days.

1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:58.640
Friday?

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:00.000
FRIDAY: Deploying fire
suppression system.

1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:02.160
Uh-oh.

1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:05.160
Oh, boy!

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:08.840
Whoa!

1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:16.560
We gotta go.
That guy's probably
in Siberia by now.

1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:18.120
We gotta draw out the flyers.

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:20.040
I'll take Vision,
you get to the jet.

1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:21.840
No, you get to the jet!

1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:23.200
Both of you!

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:26.680
The rest of us
aren't getting out of here.

1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:28.040
As much as I hate
to admit it...

1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:29.600
if we're gonna win this one,

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.280
some of us
might have to lose it.

1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:33.520
FALCON: This isn't
the real fight, Steve.

1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:35.200
All right, Sam.
What's the play?

1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:37.600
We need a diversion.
Something big.

1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:40.880
ANT-MAN:
I got something kinda big.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.400
But I can't hold it very long.

1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:44.760
On my signal,
run like hell.

1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:46.240
And if I tear myself
in half...

1:38:46.440 --> 1:38:47.560
don't come back for me.

1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:48.680
He's gonna tear
himself in half?

1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:50.240
You sure about this, Scott?

1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:51.760
ANT-MAN: I do it all the time.

1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:53.760
I mean, once. In a lab.

1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:55.560
Then I passed out.

1:38:55.720 --> 1:38:57.640
I'm the boss, I'm the boss,
I'm the boss.

1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:15.280
Holy shit!

1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:21.440
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:24.600
I guess that's the signal.

1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:26.240
Way to go, Tic Tac!

1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:29.600
Give me back my Rhodey.

1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:34.440
I got him.

1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:59.640
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking

1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:01.440
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:02.720
I'm open to suggestions.

1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:12.480
ANT-MAN:
You wanna get to them...

1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.400
you gotta go through me.

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:25.840
Uh-huh.

1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:42.240
We haven't met yet.

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.560
I'm Clint.
I don't care.

1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:01.720
Whoa!

1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:07.760
Ahhh!

1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:15.360
Get off!

1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:32.040
Something just flew in me!

1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:57.320
You're not gonna stop.

1:41:57.920 --> 1:41:58.920
You know I can't.

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:00.960
I'm gonna regret this.

1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:05.920
Go.

1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.640
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:15.760
Empire Strikes Back?

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:17.280
WAR MACHINE: Jesus, Tony,
how old is this guy?

1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:18.480
I don't know,
I didn't carbon-date him.

1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:19.680
He's on the young side.

1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.760
You know that part where
they're on the snow planet...

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.520
with the walking thingies?

1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:30.960
Maybe the kid's
onto something.

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:32.120
High now, Tony. Go high.

1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:41.600
SPIDER-MAN: Yes!

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:43.800
That was awesome!

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:01.520
Does anyone have
any orange slices?

1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:08.000
Kid, you all right?

1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:09.240
Whoa!

1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:13.240
Same side. Guess who.
Hi. It's me.

1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:14.480
Hey, man.
Yeah.

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:15.840
That was scary.
Yeah.

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:17.640
You're done, all right?

1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:18.800
What? I'm good, I'm fine.

1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:19.920
You did a good job.
Stay down.

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:21.160
No, it's good.
I gotta get him back.

1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:22.320
You're going home
or I'll call Aunt May!

1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:23.680
Dude.
You're done!

1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:24.880
Wait.

1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:28.040
I'm not done. I'm not...

1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:32.520
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1:43:48.680 --> 1:43:50.880
BLACK WIDOW: I said I'd help
you find him, not catch him.

1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:53.040
There's a difference.

1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:00.720
I'm sorry.

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:02.520
Me, too.

1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:04.440
It's as I said.

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.640
Catastrophe.

1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:21.400
Vision, I got a bandit
on my six.

1:44:26.160 --> 1:44:27.120
Vision! You copy?

1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:29.320
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.

1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:45.600
Rhodey!

1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:49.200
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:58.400
Rhodes!

1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:12.600
Read vitals.

1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:14.000
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected.

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.200
Emergency medical
is on its way.

1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.360
I'm sorry.

1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.600
- this is room 201...

1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:48.600
Bacon and black coffee again today?

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:51.480
You know me so well...

1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:55.840
Hello? Your breakfast is here.

1:45:55.920 --> 1:45:56.960
May I let myself in?

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:24.000
What's gonna happen
to your friends?

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:33.960
Whatever it is...

1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:36.440
I'll deal with it.

1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:41.360
I don't know if
I'm worth all this, Steve.

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:50.480
What you did
all those years...

1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:52.960
It wasn't you.

1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:55.520
You didn't have a choice.

1:46:56.720 --> 1:46:58.360
I know.

1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:03.280
But I did it.

1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:19.520
How did this happen?

1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:21.720
I became distracted.

1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:26.160
I didn't think
that was possible.

1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:29.240
Neither did I.

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:48.760
TONY: The doctors say
he shattered L4 through S1.

1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:51.720
Extreme laceration
to the spinal cord.

1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:54.520
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.

1:47:57.840 --> 1:47:59.400
NATASHA:
Steve's not gonna stop.

1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:01.200
If you don't either,

1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:02.480
Rhodey's gonna be
the best case scenario.

1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:03.920
You let them go, Nat.

1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:05.120
We played this wrong.

1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:06.520
"We"?

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:08.040
Boy, it must be hard to

1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:09.200
shake the whole
double agent thing, huh?

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:11.400
It sticks
in the DNA.

1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:15.520
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...

1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:17.760
for one goddamn second?

1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:24.200
T'Challa told Ross
what you did, so...

1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:27.120
they're coming for you.

1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:30.600
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.

1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:40.880
What am I looking at, Friday?

1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:43.440
FRIDAY: Priority upload
from Berlin police.

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:47.840
Fire up the chopper.

1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:55.760
FRIDAY: The Task Force
called for a psychiatrist

1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:57.560
as soon as Barnes
was captured.

1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.000
The UN dispatched
Doctor Theo Broussard

1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:01.520
from Geneva within the hour.

1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:03.320
He was met by this man.

1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:04.480
TONY: Did you run
facial recognition yet?

1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:05.680
FRIDAY: What do I look like?

1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:07.840
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing
a redhead.

1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:09.600
You must be thinking
of someone else.

1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:10.760
Must be.

1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:13.680
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.

1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:17.000
Sokovian Intelligence.

1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:20.000
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...

1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:22.680
a Sokovian covert kill squad.

1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:26.320
What happened to
the real Broussard?

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.360
He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.

1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:31.200
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...

1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.440
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.

1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:38.280
Son of a bitch.

1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:42.200
Get this to Ross.
Yes, boss.

1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:17.760
This is Raft Prison Control.

1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:20.360
You're cleared
for landing, Mr. Stark.

1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:54.840
So? You got the files?

1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.160
Let's reroute the satellites,

1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:58.240
start facial scanning
for this Zemo guy.

1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:00.520
You seriously think
I'm gonna listen to you

1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:02.760
after that fiasco
in Leipzig?

1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:05.360
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.

1:52:36.040 --> 1:52:38.680
CLINT: The Futurist,
gentlemen!

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.280
The Futurist is here!

1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:42.800
He sees all!

1:52:43.720 --> 1:52:46.880
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.

1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:48.520
Give me a break, Barton.

1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:51.240
I had no idea they'd
put you here. Come on.

1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:54.480
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.

1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:57.800
Yeah, but not some super-max
floating ocean pokey.

1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.400
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:01.840
CLINT: Criminals?

1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.720
Criminals, Tony.

1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:07.560
Think that's the word
you're looking for.

1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:10.040
Right?

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:12.320
That didn't used
to mean me.

1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:14.320
Or Sam, or Wanda.

1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:16.040
But here we are.

1:53:16.200 --> 1:53:17.880
Because you broke the law.
Yeah.

1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:19.080
I didn't make you.

1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:22.040
La, la, la, la, la...
You read it, you broke it.

1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:25.920
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.

1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:27.240
I don't understand,
why didn't you

1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:29.240
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:32.280
You gotta watch your back
with this guy.

1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:35.720
There's a chance
he's gonna break it.

1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:40.440
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.

1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:42.680
Who are you?

1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:45.200
Come on, man.

1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:47.600
SAM: How's Rhodes?

1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:50.640
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...

1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:51.960
so fingers crossed.

1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:55.200
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

1:53:57.240 --> 1:53:58.800
You're the good cop, now?

1:53:59.480 --> 1:54:01.240
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.

1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:02.960
Well, you better go
get a bad cop...

1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:05.200
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...

1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:07.320
to get information
out of me.

1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:09.480
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.

1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:10.800
We got about
30 seconds before

1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:12.480
they realize
it's not their equipment.

1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:14.480
SECRETARY ROSS:
What'd you do?

1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:16.240
Get it back up!

1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:17.920
Just look.

1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:20.720
Because that...

1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:23.000
is the fellow
who was supposed to
interrogate Barnes.

1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:27.160
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:28.800
That's a first.

1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:30.560
Cap is definitely
off the reservation...

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:32.160
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.

1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:33.760
We don't know
each other very well.

1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:34.920
You don't have to...

1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.400
Hey, it's all right.

1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:46.760
Look, I'll tell you...

1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:50.000
but you have to go alone
and as a friend.

1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:52.600
Easy.

1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:56.600
SECRETARY ROSS: Stark?

1:54:57.200 --> 1:54:58.840
Did he give you anything
on Rogers?

1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:00.040
Nope. Told me to go to hell.

1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:02.040
I'm going back
to the compound instead,

1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:04.120
but you can call me anytime.

1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:05.880
I'll put you on hold. I like
to watch the line blink.

1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:16.920
You remember that time
we had to ride back

1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:19.360
from Rockaway Beach in the
back of that freezer truck?

1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:21.560
Was that the time
we used our train money

1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:22.760
to buy hot dogs?

1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:24.520
You blew three bucks
trying to win

1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:26.120
that stuffed bear
for a redhead.

1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:27.760
What was her name, again?

1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:29.760
Dolores.
You called her Dot.

1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:31.960
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.

1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:33.280
So are we, pal.

1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:45.120
STEVE: He can't have
been here more than
a few hours.

1:56:45.280 --> 1:56:47.280
BUCKY: Long enough
to wake them up.

1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:30.480
You ready?

1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:31.640
Yeah.

1:57:45.200 --> 1:57:47.280
You seem a little defensive.

1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:49.680
It's been a long day.

1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:52.360
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.

1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:53.760
Then why are you here?

1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:57.440
Could be your story's
not so crazy.

1:57:57.520 --> 1:57:58.520
Maybe.

1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:03.040
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.160
Otherwise, I gotta
arrest myself.

1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:09.040
Well, that sounds like
a lot of paperwork.

1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:14.040
It's good to see you, Tony.

1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:15.160
You too, Cap.

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:18.640
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.

1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:20.720
There's a truce here.
You can drop...

1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:42.040
IRON MAN:
I got heat signatures.

1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:43.680
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
How many?

1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:46.600
Uh, one.

1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:07.440
If it's any comfort,

1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:09.120
they died in their sleep.

1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:19.240
Did you really think
I wanted more of you?

1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:22.120
What the hell?

1:59:22.920 --> 1:59:24.720
I'm grateful to them, though.

1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:27.280
They brought you here.

1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:33.760
Please, Captain.

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:35.720
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand

1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:38.400
the launch blast of
UR-100 rockets.

1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:40.320
IRON MAN: I'm betting
I could beat that.

1:59:40.480 --> 1:59:42.280
HELMUT ZEMO: Oh, I'm sure
you could, Mr. Stark.

1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:44.280
Given time.

1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:46.400
But then you'd never know
why you came.

1:59:46.560 --> 1:59:49.120
You killed innocent
people in Vienna just
to bring us here?

1:59:55.840 --> 1:59:59.440
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.

2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:01.960
I studied you.

2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:03.840
I followed you.

2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:06.160
But now that
you're standing here...

2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:08.440
I just realized...

2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:13.080
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.

2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:17.960
How nice to find a flaw.

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:20.080
You're Sokovian.

2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:22.800
Is that what
this is about?

2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:24.600
Sokovia was a failed state

2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:26.440
long before
you blew it to hell.

2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520
No.

2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:32.040
I'm here because
I made a promise.

2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:36.360
You lost someone?

2:00:40.280 --> 2:00:42.320
I lost everyone.

2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:45.760
And so will you.

2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:55.680
An empire toppled by
its enemies can rise again.

2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:58.880
But one which crumbles
from within?

2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:02.000
That's dead.

2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:04.160
Forever.

2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:14.680
I know that road.

2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:18.080
What is this?

2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:42.880
Help my wife.

2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.280
Please. Help.

2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:53.040
Sergeant Barnes?

2:01:54.720 --> 2:01:56.080
MARIA: Howard!

2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:04.720
Howard!

2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:43.720
No, Tony.

2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:54.160
Did you know?

2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:57.840
I didn't know
it was him.

2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.520
Don't bullshit me, Rogers.
Did you know?

2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:05.360
Yes.

2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:03.760
Get out of here!

2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:16.040
It wasn't him, Tony.

2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:17.120
HYDRA had control of his mind!

2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:18.200
Move!

2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:19.280
It wasn't him!

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:29.760
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing.

2:04:30.520 --> 2:04:32.600
Flight systems compromised.

2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:34.280
Ah, crap.

2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.840
He's not gonna stop. Go.

2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:13.840
Come on, come on.

2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:15.640
FRIDAY: Targeting system's
knackered, boss.

2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:16.800
I'm eyeballing it.

2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:37.000
Do you even remember them?

2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:38.920
I remember
all of them.

2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:03.680
This isn't gonna change
what happened.

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:05.360
I don't care.

2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:07.400
He killed my mom.

2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:10.400
WOMAN: You should have
seen his little face.

2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:12.080
Just try, okay?

2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:14.120
I'm going to bed.

2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:15.920
I love you.

2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:26.480
T'CHALLA: I almost
killed the wrong man.

2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:29.480
Hardly an innocent one.

2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:31.280
T'CHALLA:
This is all you wanted?

2:07:32.280 --> 2:07:34.800
To see them
rip each other apart.

2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:41.400
My father lived
outside the city.

2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:44.680
I thought
we would be safe there.

2:07:45.280 --> 2:07:47.120
My son was excited.

2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:50.120
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:54.400
I told my wife,
"Don't worry.

2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:58.480
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:03.200
When the dust cleared...

2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.400
and the screaming stopped...

2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:11.080
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:15.000
My father...

2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:19.320
still holding my wife
and son in his arms.

2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:25.840
And the Avengers?

2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:28.600
They went home.

2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:32.720
I knew I couldn't
kill them.

2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:35.360
More powerful men
than me have tried.

2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:39.920
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...

2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:47.200
I'm sorry about
your father.

2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:49.440
He seemed a good man.

2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:52.840
With a dutiful son.

2:08:57.440 --> 2:08:59.360
Vengeance has consumed you.

2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:04.360
It's consuming them.

2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:10.440
I am done letting it
consume me.

2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:16.400
Justice will come
soon enough.

2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:21.600
Tell that to the dead.

2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:28.800
The living are
not done with you, yet.

2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:34.080
FRIDAY: You can't beat him
hand-to-hand.

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:36.440
Analyze his fight pattern.

2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:37.920
Scanning.

2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:43.760
Countermeasures ready.

2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:46.800
Let's kick his ass.

2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:01.920
He's my friend.

2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:03.680
So was I.

2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:12.760
Stay down. Final warning.

2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:28.720
I could do this all day.

2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:38.000
That shield
doesn't belong to you.

2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:41.200
You don't deserve it.

2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:43.360
My father made that shield!

2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:20.880
Meals at 8 and 5.

2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:22.720
Toilet privileges
twice a day.

2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:27.240
Raise your voice, zap.

2:12:27.960 --> 2:12:30.080
Touch the glass, zap.

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:32.280
You step out of line,
you deal with me.

2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:34.800
Please, step out of line, hmm?

2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:38.320
So how does it feel?

2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:41.640
To spend all that time,
all that effort...

2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:48.840
to see it fail
so spectacularly?

2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:53.960
Did it?

2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:20.480
TONY: It's just
the first pass.

2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:21.600
JAMES RHODES: Yeah.

2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:23.720
TONY: Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.

2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:26.560
Shock absorption,
lateral movement.

2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:28.160
Cup holder?

2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:30.040
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...

2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:31.200
Ow.

2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:35.000
Let's go.
I'll give you a hand.

2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:36.840
No. Don't help me.

2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:41.040
Ah.

2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:54.320
138.

2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:57.680
138 combat missions.

2:13:57.840 --> 2:13:59.600
That's how many
I've flown, Tony.

2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:02.840
Every one of them
could've been my last,
but I flew them.

2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:06.400
Because the fight
needed to be fought.

2:14:06.920 --> 2:14:08.560
It's the same with
these Accords.

2:14:09.080 --> 2:14:12.600
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.

2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:16.600
And yeah, this sucks.
This is, uh...

2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:19.680
This is a bad beat.

2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:23.440
But it hasn't
changed my mind.

2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:26.440
I don't think.

2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.280
You okay?
Oh, yeah.

2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.560
Are you Tony Stank?

2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:49.040
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.

2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:50.880
Thank you for that!

2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:52.920
Never dropping that,
by the way.

2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:55.080
"Table for one, Mr. Stank.

2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:56.400
"Please, by the bathroom."

2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:03.800
STEVE: Tony...

2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:06.960
I'm glad you're
back at the compound.

2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:08.120
I don't like the idea of you

2:15:08.200 --> 2:15:09.920
rattling around
a mansion by yourself.

2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:11.760
We all need family.

2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:17.080
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.

2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:20.240
I've been on my own
since I was 18.

2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:23.760
I never really
fit in anywhere,

2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:25.680
even in the Army.

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:30.480
My faith's in people, I guess.

2:15:30.640 --> 2:15:31.840
Individuals.

2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:35.840
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...

2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:37.600
they haven't let me down.

2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:42.160
Which is why I can't
let them down either.

2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:49.440
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:53.480
I know I hurt you, Tony.

2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:55.400
I guess I thought
by not telling you

2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:56.680
about your parents...

2:15:56.800 --> 2:15:59.160
I was sparing you...

2:15:59.320 --> 2:16:01.960
but I can see now that I was
really sparing myself.

2:16:02.480 --> 2:16:04.440
And I'm sorry.

2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:06.240
Hopefully one day
you can understand.

2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:09.440
I wish we agreed
on the Accords.

2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:11.120
I really do.

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:12.800
I know you're doing
what you believe in,

2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:14.440
and that's all
any of us can do.

2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:15.880
That's all any of us should.

2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:17.960
FRIDAY: Priority call from
Secretary Ross.

2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:19.880
There's been a breach
at the Raft prison.

2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:23.400
Yeah, put him through.

2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:25.880
SECRETARY ROSS:
Tony, we have a problem.

2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:28.080
Uh, please hold.
No, don't.

2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:32.320
STEVE: So no matter what...

2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:34.720
I promise you...

2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:36.640
if you need us...

2:16:37.320 --> 2:16:38.880
if you need me...

2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:45.000
I'll be there.

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:45.320
You sure about this?

2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:49.200
I can't trust
my own mind.

2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:53.120
So, until they figure out

2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:54.720
how to get this stuff
out of my head...

2:18:54.880 --> 2:18:57.280
I think going back under
is the best thing.

2:18:58.040 --> 2:18:59.560
For everybody.
