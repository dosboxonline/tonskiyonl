WEBVTT

01:47.316 --> 01:49.557
Idiots.

01:53.322 --> 01:57.406
Take the captain beyond the reef till
we get permission to bring him ashore.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.407
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

02:02.414 --> 02:06.874
Fernand Mondego does not abandon his friends
in the face of stupid, suicidal danger.

02:06.877 --> 02:11.621
However, as Monsieur Morell's official
representative on this voyage, Edmond,

02:11.715 --> 02:14.752
I must officially tell you you have
overstepped your bounds as second mate.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.550
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.261
If we don't get him to a doctor,
he will die. Do you understand?

02:20.265 --> 02:23.257
Of course I understand. Just
don't expect me to do this sober.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.259
Right.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.603
English dragoons.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.393
Hello!

02:32.235 --> 02:34.726
Dantes, don't.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.774
- A little careless, don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.401
Well, I know, but...

02:42.412 --> 02:43.777
We're French sailors!

02:43.872 --> 02:46.329
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.951
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.244
We mean no harm!

02:52.339 --> 02:54.250
Edmond!

02:59.262 --> 03:02.095
Come on! Climb!

03:12.234 --> 03:14.270
Look out!

03:37.801 --> 03:39.462
Fernand!

03:44.516 --> 03:47.974
Good. You finally
hit something.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.648
Lieutenant Graypool.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.359
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

03:58.363 --> 04:00.524
then by all means
shoot them.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.652
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.821
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.575
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

04:09.666 --> 04:13.329
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

04:13.420 --> 04:18.540
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

04:18.550 --> 04:21.212
son of the Count Mondego.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.841
Our captain has contracted brain
fever, so we put in here for help.

04:28.018 --> 04:32.682
If his coma is genuine, he won't
feel my knife point, will he?

04:35.233 --> 04:38.020
Only a scratch.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.026
Edmond!

04:48.038 --> 04:50.529
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

04:50.624 --> 04:55.209
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.929
It has been an eventful evening.

05:16.233 --> 05:21.068
If I hadn't have shot those dragoons, you
might by lying in pieces on the beach right now.

05:21.071 --> 05:25.405
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.780
Yet... we survive.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.112
# Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin #

05:32.123 --> 05:34.114
Whoo-hoo!

05:34.125 --> 05:38.619
# Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin ##

05:38.630 --> 05:40.916
King's to you, Mondego.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.587
Being your friend
is always an adventure.

05:44.594 --> 05:48.086
Yes, it is, isn't it?

05:48.098 --> 05:50.430
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.969
What?

05:52.060 --> 05:55.302
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

05:55.397 --> 05:59.640
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

05:59.734 --> 06:03.602
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.609
I think you'll find
the 1: The finer vintage.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.529
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

06:10.620 --> 06:12.952
if I might have
a word with you.

06:15.292 --> 06:19.786
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

06:19.796 --> 06:23.789
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.169
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.465
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

06:30.473 --> 06:35.388
In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.812
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.313
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.815
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.485
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.656
I have written a rather sentimental
letter to an old comrade in Marseilles.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.329
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.408
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

06:59.502 --> 07:03.370
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.542
Oh, I-I don't...

07:05.634 --> 07:08.546
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.549
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.014
But more important, it is the price
I demand for the use of my physician.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.016
Then I agree.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.015
Good.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.234
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

07:26.321 --> 07:30.564
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion. How will I find him?

07:30.659 --> 07:33.571
Oh, he will find you.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.405
Now, I do not wish this letter's
existence to be known to anyone else.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.787
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.243
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.997
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.431
What did he want?

08:04.442 --> 08:09.527
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

08:29.092 --> 08:33.085
Time you were on your way. Your
captain has been dead for half an hour.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.133
Are you sure?

08:39.144 --> 08:42.761
When you have walked as many
battlefields as I, young Dantes,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.767
you can feel death.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.984
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.488
Emperors... and fools.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.961
Come about!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.518
Drive faster.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.987
Danglars, what's happened?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.540
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

09:45.543 --> 09:48.000
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.997
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.842
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me, Monsieur Morell?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.005
Go.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.845
Mercedes.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.852
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.183
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.856
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.899
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.072
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.408
Is this true?

10:20.411 --> 10:22.868
I accept
all responsibility.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.410
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

10:26.417 --> 10:30.251
It should have
been your idea.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.747
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.921
- I was protectin' the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

10:37.011 --> 10:40.799
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

10:40.890 --> 10:46.385
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.599
You presume to demote me?

10:52.694 --> 10:54.605
There is no demotion.

10:54.696 --> 10:58.780
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.234
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.960
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

11:15.967 --> 11:19.255
who will want
to hear this news.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.761
Thank you.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.147
Monsieur Morell?

11:36.154 --> 11:41.649
- I understand you had a ship
just returned from Elba, monsieur. - Yes.

11:41.659 --> 11:46.449
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

11:46.456 --> 11:50.074
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.288
Thank you, monsieur.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.958
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.791
The name is Clarion.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.342
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.973
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.392
So would I.

12:13.483 --> 12:17.317
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

12:17.320 --> 12:22.155
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.484
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

12:25.578 --> 12:30.368
Remember when we were kids and Edmond got that
whistle for his birthday, and you got a pony?

12:30.375 --> 12:34.163
You were so mad Edmond was happier with
his whistle than you were with your pony.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.997
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.877
How long do you think it's going
to be before he can afford a wife?

12:43.972 --> 12:48.011
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.093
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

12:51.187 --> 12:55.226
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

12:55.233 --> 12:57.474
particularly
a bride like you.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.689
Hey!

13:00.697 --> 13:02.858
- There he is.
- Hey!

13:02.949 --> 13:05.156
- Whoo!
- Mercedes!

13:11.040 --> 13:14.373
I missed you so.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.872
The missing is over now.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.872
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.213
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.886
Edmond!

13:30.893 --> 13:33.054
King's to me.

13:33.062 --> 13:38.102
Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.771
Come on.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.074
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.193
Come on!

14:18.608 --> 14:21.941
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.158
Do you keep secrets from me?

14:30.244 --> 14:34.283
Secrets? No.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.246
Why?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.958
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.295
We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

14:50.306 --> 14:55.846
- As soon as I can afford the ring,
we'll wed... - I don't need a ring. I don't.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.519
This will be my ring.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.569
And no matter what happens,

15:09.659 --> 15:14.028
you will never see it
off my finger.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.994
Ever.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.339
Hello, my fine young gentleman.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.382
Care to join me?

15:37.478 --> 15:40.140
So tell me, Mondego,

15:42.358 --> 15:45.566
how did you ever
become friends...

15:45.653 --> 15:48.861
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

15:51.033 --> 15:53.820
He claims to be my friend,

15:55.538 --> 15:58.530
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.990
What secrets?

16:17.268 --> 16:21.762
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

16:23.065 --> 16:27.024
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.234
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

16:32.325 --> 16:37.240
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.912
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.083
Edmond Dantes, you are under arrest by
order of the magistrate of Marseilles.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.459
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

16:49.467 --> 16:52.300
That information is
privileged. Take him.

16:52.303 --> 16:56.797
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

16:56.891 --> 17:00.975
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.269
Mon Dieu.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.492
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.950
Traitor?

17:21.958 --> 17:25.496
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.170
Did you have any personal contact
with Napoleon when you were on Elba?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.459
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

17:31.467 --> 17:36.302
I was with the Count Mondego's son,
Fernand, almost the entire time.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.638
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.809
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.478
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

17:49.277 --> 17:54.647
Except for when Napoleon asked me to deliver
a personal letter to a friend in Marseilles.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.824
Well, Dantes, it is for accepting
that treasonous correspondence...

17:58.828 --> 18:02.662
that you have been denounced by your
own first mate, a Monsieur Danglars.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.490
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.327
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

18:08.337 --> 18:11.500
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.899
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

18:34.989 --> 18:39.858
Well, Dantes, this is a letter
to one of Napoleon's agents.

18:39.952 --> 18:44.696
It gives the times and the locations
of the British beach patrols on Elba.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.533
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.535
He swore its contents
were innocent.

18:57.637 --> 19:02.757
No, it's you
that's innocent.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.429
Foolish and innocent.

19:05.436 --> 19:09.054
I believe these are the worst charges
that could be leveled against you.

19:09.148 --> 19:14.734
Fortunately, as I've intercepted
this document, there's no harm done.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.233
God knows how you're going to
survive in this world, Edmond Dantes.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.232
But you are no traitor.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.859
You may go.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.326
Thank you, sir.

19:30.586 --> 19:36.126
Wait, uh, did Napoleon tell you
who's supposed to pick up the letter?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.294
Monsieur Clarion.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.377
What name did you say?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.467
Monsieur Clarion.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.100
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.473
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

19:50.481 --> 19:55.692
No, sir, in fact, Monsieur Mondego
knows nothing of this letter.

20:00.658 --> 20:05.652
This is very
dangerous information.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.621
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.825
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.293
Mm-hmm.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.834
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.713
I wonder if, by way of an apology,
I could offer you my carriage home.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.591
It's just through here.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.850
Thank you.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.833
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

20:54.837 --> 20:57.044
Monsieur Villefort!

21:18.611 --> 21:20.476
Whoa. Whoa!

21:24.492 --> 21:27.234
Where are you taking me?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.698
This is a mistake.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.533
- I'm allowed to go home. - From now on,
your home is the prison Chateau d'If.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.539
No! No! No!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.837
Hey!

21:46.347 --> 21:49.965
Shoot him now!

21:50.059 --> 21:53.392
Mount up!
Get after him!

22:09.662 --> 22:14.281
Fernand! Fernand!

22:14.291 --> 22:17.283
- Monsieur?
- It's all right. He's right here. Fernand!

22:17.378 --> 22:21.291
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.914
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.625
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.631
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.304
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.924
It was to one of his agents.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.848
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.975
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.146
All right.
We just have to think.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.147
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.320
I was hoping your father
could help me.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.609
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.659
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.282
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.989
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.117
Good.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.620
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.342
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.297
It was you?

23:12.308 --> 23:15.015
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.344
Why didn't you
come to me first?

23:18.439 --> 23:21.146
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.358
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

23:24.361 --> 23:27.353
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.285
You... You read...

23:39.084 --> 23:41.200
Why are you doing this?

23:41.211 --> 23:45.875
Oh, it's complicated.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.837
Complicated.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.047
Don't be ridiculous.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.554
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.244
Get away from the window.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.367
Don't make me
take off your hand!

24:50.364 --> 24:54.403
Why? In God's name, why?

24:54.410 --> 24:58.244
Because you're the son of a clerk!

24:58.247 --> 25:00.579
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.620
- In here!
- In here!

25:13.220 --> 25:15.302
- Get!
- Wait.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.927
Hold it. Hold it.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.434
To remember better days.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.732
Come on!

25:32.114 --> 25:34.947
I told you it wasn't always
going to be this way, Edmond.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.625
Father! Where is he?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.674
The study.
What's he done now?

25:53.761 --> 25:58.004
Now, you listen to me, Father. I am the chief
magistrate, an official of the new regime.

25:58.098 --> 26:02.933
I cannot afford to have my own
father mixed up in treasonous affairs!

26:04.021 --> 26:06.979
You know...

26:07.066 --> 26:11.810
In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

26:11.820 --> 26:16.860
I shall be the patriot, and you the
traitor, when the emperor returns.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.153
Stop it. Stop it,
you old ruin.

26:19.244 --> 26:24.159
Those days are over. Napoleon Bonaparte
is no longer the emperor of anything.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.329
If you continue to dabble in this
lunacy, you run an excellent chance...

26:27.336 --> 26:30.828
of being arrested and ruining our entire
family all because of your idiotic sympathies.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.579
At least I have sympathies.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.837
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

26:35.928 --> 26:38.510
is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.510
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

26:42.601 --> 26:45.559
I'm an old ruin.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.680
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.195
Move it.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.078
Move.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.167
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.595
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'If.

28:03.682 --> 28:08.767
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

28:08.854 --> 28:13.439
but I assure you I am innocent.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.149
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.940
- Innocent.
- Yes.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.939
I know. I really do know.

28:23.160 --> 28:27.494
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

28:27.497 --> 28:32.833
I know perfectly well that you are
innocent. Why else would you be here?

28:32.836 --> 28:36.374
If you were truly guilty,

28:36.465 --> 28:40.959
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

28:41.053 --> 28:46.468
but Chateau d'If is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.936
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

29:09.039 --> 29:13.373
"God will give me justice."

29:13.460 --> 29:16.918
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

29:17.005 --> 29:22.170
Or they keep calendars, but soon
they lose interest or they die.

29:22.177 --> 29:26.216
- There's a window. - All I'm left
with is a rather unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.845
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.889
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

29:33.897 --> 29:36.058
we hurt them.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.728
Usually just
a simple beating really.

29:38.819 --> 29:43.688
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

29:43.782 --> 29:46.239
I like to do
something rather special.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.530
And if you're
thinking just now,

29:52.624 --> 29:55.411
"Why me, O God?"

29:55.419 --> 30:00.288
- The answer is, God has
nothing to do with it. - All right?

30:00.382 --> 30:03.749
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

30:03.760 --> 30:09.050
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.682
All right.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.811
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

30:16.898 --> 30:22.564
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.795
Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

30:41.882 --> 30:43.998
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

30:44.092 --> 30:47.835
Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

30:50.349 --> 30:55.309
Pack all my files. And tell that
idiot clerk to find the ledger!

30:55.312 --> 30:59.646
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.310
Not now! Dantes?

31:01.401 --> 31:06.816
We have not met, monsieur. I am Fernand
Mondego, the son of Count Mondego.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.024
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

31:10.118 --> 31:15.283
This is his employer, Monsieur Morell,
his father, and his fiancee, Mercedes.

31:18.919 --> 31:22.161
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.629
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.637
What if I was to tell you that
Dantes is also charged with murder?

31:32.724 --> 31:36.558
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.512
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.517
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.350
No, if you knew him, monsieur, you
would know that was not possible.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.355
Have mercy, please.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.028
You have proof
of this treason?

31:49.032 --> 31:51.023
That is government business.

31:51.034 --> 31:55.027
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

31:55.038 --> 31:58.326
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.541
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

32:01.628 --> 32:06.713
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

32:06.800 --> 32:08.836
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.553
Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

32:12.639 --> 32:17.724
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.719
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.061
My son is no traitor!

32:22.149 --> 32:24.356
I will try to reason with him.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.692
- Let's leave this to Fernand. He can
plead the case. - It's impossible. Never.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.270
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

32:30.365 --> 32:33.072
I will never
forget your kindness.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.698
And I shall never
cease to give it.

32:42.043 --> 32:46.582
Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

32:46.673 --> 32:48.584
but still, murder?

32:48.675 --> 32:51.542
It's quite simple really.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.877
When you reported Dantes's
receiving the letter to me,

32:53.889 --> 32:56.255
I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

32:56.349 --> 33:00.433
but now having seen his exquisite
fiancee, I understand completely.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.058
What prompts you to be
so accommodating?

33:06.359 --> 33:08.270
Sit down, Mondego.

33:16.203 --> 33:20.071
Come back!

33:20.081 --> 33:22.072
Come back!

33:22.167 --> 33:26.581
What's my crime?
What's my crime?

33:26.671 --> 33:29.287
I'm innocent!

34:54.342 --> 34:56.503
Happy anniversary, Dantes.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.222
Until next year.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.808
Has it really been
four years, Delius?

35:46.895 --> 35:50.433
Or Danton? What is his name again?

37:46.055 --> 37:48.011
Forgive my intrusion.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.931
But I was under
the impression that I...

37:54.022 --> 37:57.890
I was digging
toward the outer wall.

38:01.237 --> 38:04.070
Parlez-vous anglais?

38:04.157 --> 38:07.695
Italiano?

38:07.702 --> 38:13.242
I am Abbe Faria. I have been a prisoner
in Chateau d'If for 11 years.

38:13.333 --> 38:16.200
Five which
have been spent...

38:16.211 --> 38:19.874
digging this tunnel.

38:24.260 --> 38:29.254
There are 72,519 stones...

38:29.265 --> 38:31.756
in my walls.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.059
I've counted them many times.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.556
But have you
named them yet?

38:41.069 --> 38:44.277
Shh, shh.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.568
Shh, shh.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.775
Once I was as you are now.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.278
But I promise, it will pass.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.078
I promise, I promise.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.623
Now, may I stand
on your shoulders?

39:08.805 --> 39:12.798
Take me down.

39:12.809 --> 39:15.471
Please, take me down now.
Take me down.

39:21.276 --> 39:26.987
I have not seen the sky
these 11 years. Thank you.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.938
Thank you, God.

39:28.950 --> 39:32.613
There is no talk of God
in here, priest.

39:32.704 --> 39:36.492
What about
the... inscription?

39:36.499 --> 39:41.163
It's faded, just as God
has faded from my heart.

39:41.170 --> 39:46.665
- And what has replaced it?
- Revenge.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.885
Hold these.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.133
Follow me.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.304
Perhaps your thoughts
of revenge...

39:56.394 --> 39:59.557
are serving God's purpose
of keeping you alive...

39:59.647 --> 40:02.013
these seven years.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.233
- To what end?
- Escape.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.614
There we go.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.233
You spoke of escape.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.615
Yeah.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.944
There are only two possibilities
of reaching the outer wall...

40:58.039 --> 41:00.280
and finally the sea.

41:00.375 --> 41:04.709
I simply...
I simply chose the wrong one.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.754
Now, of course,
with two of us,

41:07.840 --> 41:10.547
we could dig in
the opposite direction.

41:10.551 --> 41:16.046
With both of us together, then, of course,
we could possibly do it in, oh, eight years.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.269
Oh, does something else
demand your time?

41:24.357 --> 41:27.690
Some pressing appointment,
perhaps?

41:29.862 --> 41:33.070
In return... for your help,

41:33.157 --> 41:35.398
I offer something priceless.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.233
My freedom?

41:37.245 --> 41:39.952
No, freedom
can be taken away,

41:40.039 --> 41:42.746
as you well know.

41:42.750 --> 41:47.119
I offer knowledge,
everything I have learned.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.751
I will teach you, oh,
economics, mathematics,

41:50.758 --> 41:53.921
- philosophy, science.
- To read and write?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.719
Of course.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.434
When do we start?

42:04.772 --> 42:06.808
I got it. I got it.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.983
Lights out. Lights.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.442
Let's have 'em. Come on.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.611
The slot opens twice a day.

42:17.618 --> 42:23.284
Once for your toilet bucket,
which is where we hide the dirt.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.289
Come on.

42:27.754 --> 42:31.167
And once in the evening
for your plate.

42:32.842 --> 42:35.458
Lights out. Out.

42:35.470 --> 42:38.553
Come on, priest.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.800
Thank you.

42:40.808 --> 42:44.050
Between those times we can work all day
without fear of discovery.

42:44.145 --> 42:47.637
"So neglect becomes...

42:47.648 --> 42:50.185
our ally."

42:50.193 --> 42:52.149
Excellent.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.860
So you were in
Napoleon's army.

42:58.951 --> 43:02.034
We had such dreams then.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.033
However, one night...

43:05.041 --> 43:08.499
my regiment ran down...

43:08.586 --> 43:10.702
a band of guerrillas,

43:10.797 --> 43:14.039
who ran into a church
for sanctuary.

43:14.133 --> 43:19.548
I was ordered to burn...
down the church...

43:19.555 --> 43:22.888
with them inside it.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.848
Did you?

43:27.146 --> 43:31.936
To my everlasting shame, I did.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.062
I did.

43:34.153 --> 43:36.235
How did you come to be here?

43:36.239 --> 43:39.447
The following day
I deserted...

43:39.534 --> 43:42.401
to devote my life
to repentance...

43:42.411 --> 43:44.527
and to God.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.284
I worked as
private secretary to...

43:47.375 --> 43:52.244
the enormously wealthy
Count Enrique Spada.

43:52.255 --> 43:56.089
Spada was
a righteous man.

43:56.092 --> 44:00.961
Sadly, a couple
of years later, he died...

44:01.055 --> 44:06.925
amidst rumors that he had
hidden his limitless fortune.

44:09.063 --> 44:12.555
- Two weeks later, I was arrested.
- Why?

44:12.567 --> 44:16.560
Napoleon wanted
Spada's treasure.

44:16.571 --> 44:21.440
He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

44:21.534 --> 44:26.654
So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

44:26.747 --> 44:31.286
And so here I've remained
with only God...

44:31.294 --> 44:34.627
for company
until he sent me you.

44:34.714 --> 44:37.126
God is no more real
than your treasure, priest.

44:37.216 --> 44:39.377
Perhaps.

44:51.397 --> 44:54.605
Ooh! Hurry. Get it.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.149
Compute this.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.949
2,500 cubic centimeters
of rock and dust a day...

45:05.036 --> 45:08.824
for 365 days.

45:09.916 --> 45:12.328
Equals three-and-a-half
meters a year,

45:12.418 --> 45:15.000
12 feet, a foot a month.

45:15.087 --> 45:18.329
Three inches a week.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.460
In Italian.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.887
Do not waste the light.

45:36.984 --> 45:40.397
You were a soldier, priest.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.442
So you know weaponry.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.325
Teach me.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.826
Or dig alone.

45:59.840 --> 46:05.176
You force me to walk
a fine line, Dantes.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.516
This is ridiculous.

46:16.607 --> 46:21.897
The stronger swordsman
does not necessarily win.

46:21.988 --> 46:23.899
It is speed!

46:25.199 --> 46:27.690
Speed of hand.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.026
Speed of mind.

46:30.121 --> 46:34.535
Now, sweep your hand
through the drops...

46:34.542 --> 46:36.999
without getting wet.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.083
Like this.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.592
How long must I keep this up?

46:50.391 --> 46:53.383
I am going down the tunnel.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.780
Parry. Up.

47:11.871 --> 47:13.577
Like that.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.788
Time to study.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.332
Define economics.

47:19.420 --> 47:21.786
Economics is the science
that deals with the production,

47:21.881 --> 47:23.997
distribution and
consumption of commodities.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.002
Translation.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.210
Dig first, money later.

47:46.113 --> 47:49.981
Thank you.
Happy Christmas, Edmond.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.950
Give or take a month or so.

47:57.333 --> 48:00.325
Good. Whom are you fighting?
Danglars? Mondego?

48:00.419 --> 48:02.410
Who do you think?

48:10.262 --> 48:13.504
Good! Too good.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.466
We have Newton's third law.

48:16.477 --> 48:20.811
There is a reaction
to every action...

48:20.815 --> 48:23.352
in physics... and in man.

48:23.359 --> 48:28.979
Thus my quest for vengeance is a reaction
to the actions of Danglars and Mondego.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.655
Up, up.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.825
I want that seat.

48:34.829 --> 48:40.699
You once told me that Villefort
had you rearrested just after...

48:40.709 --> 48:43.496
he had cleared you
of all the charges.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.327
You may go.

48:45.339 --> 48:48.046
Yes, that's true.

48:48.050 --> 48:52.339
Then why would he go
through that charade...

48:52.346 --> 48:57.886
unless he had reason to change his mind
about letting you go?

48:57.977 --> 49:01.014
- Think, Edmond.
- I'm trying.

49:01.021 --> 49:04.184
- What happened?
- He asked me...

49:04.191 --> 49:06.398
Did Napoleon tell you who was
supposed to pick up this letter?

49:06.402 --> 49:08.563
- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

49:08.654 --> 49:12.738
- And nothing more? - Nothing.
He burnt the letter and said I could go.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.948
Ah.

49:15.035 --> 49:19.825
He burned... the letter.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.752
Yes.

49:26.755 --> 49:30.418
Strange that a chief magistrate
would burn evidence...

49:30.426 --> 49:33.384
of a treasonous conspiracy...

49:33.387 --> 49:38.381
and then imprison
the only man...

49:38.476 --> 49:42.719
who was aware of
Monsieur Clarion's connection...

49:42.730 --> 49:44.686
to that conspiracy.

49:48.486 --> 49:52.399
- He was protecting someone.
- Ah.

49:52.490 --> 49:57.154
- A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.951
A politician like Villefort would
have rid himself of such friends.

50:00.039 --> 50:02.746
Clarion could be a relative.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.957
A close relative, possibly...

50:09.089 --> 50:11.045
No!

50:13.761 --> 50:16.969
Villefort's father was
a colonel in Napoleon's army.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.805
Villefort wasn't
protecting Clarion.

50:19.808 --> 50:23.175
He was protecting himself.

50:23.270 --> 50:27.309
Danglars, who falsely said he saw
Napoleon give me that letter.

50:27.399 --> 50:30.311
Mondego, who told
Villefort I had it.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.651
And Villefort himself,
who sent me here.

50:34.281 --> 50:38.991
Bravo, Edmond, bravo.

51:19.577 --> 51:24.037
Oh, my God. Oh, oh.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.371
Oh.

51:26.458 --> 51:29.916
Edmond, light. Light.
Quick. Light.

51:30.004 --> 51:33.041
Oh, please, God.
What is that? Look.

51:33.132 --> 51:37.501
Look. Look!
Roots. Plant roots.

51:37.511 --> 51:41.880
If these are plant roots,
then we are only months away.

51:41.890 --> 51:46.384
Yes. Well done, priest.
I'll get my chisel.

51:46.478 --> 51:49.561
Good. Good.

51:59.074 --> 52:00.860
Priest!

52:17.426 --> 52:20.964
In God's name, go on.

52:21.055 --> 52:24.218
Go on. Go on!

52:48.791 --> 52:51.703
Lungs...
are punctured.

52:51.794 --> 52:53.705
- Don't talk. Don't talk.
- Listen.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.707
There's not much time.

52:57.174 --> 52:59.460
Under th-those books,

52:59.551 --> 53:01.462
there's loose rocks.

53:01.553 --> 53:03.714
Bring me what you find.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.717
Quickly, quickly.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.676
Open it.

53:10.771 --> 53:13.137
When I told them
I did not know...

53:13.232 --> 53:16.190
where the treasure
of Spada was, I lied.

53:16.276 --> 53:18.483
You lied?

53:18.570 --> 53:21.687
I'm a priest,
not a saint.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.693
There,

53:23.784 --> 53:26.321
on that island
off the Italian coast.

53:26.328 --> 53:28.489
- Monte Cristo?
- Yes, yes.

53:28.580 --> 53:32.323
Use... Use your head.

53:32.334 --> 53:35.667
- Follow the clues.
- The tunnel's blocked. I can't escape.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.665
No, keep digging.

53:37.756 --> 53:41.340
When you escape, use it for good,
only for good.

53:41.343 --> 53:44.335
No, I will surely
use it for my revenge.

53:45.764 --> 53:48.847
Here now
is your final lesson.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.845
Do not commit...

53:52.604 --> 53:55.687
Oh. Do not commit
the crime...

53:55.774 --> 53:58.436
for which you now
serve the sentence.

53:59.528 --> 54:01.860
God said,
"Vengeance is mine."

54:01.947 --> 54:03.858
I don't believe in God.

54:03.949 --> 54:06.691
That doesn't matter.

54:06.785 --> 54:09.197
He believes in you.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.747
Priest?

54:26.472 --> 54:28.713
Plates out.

54:38.233 --> 54:40.189
Let's have it.

54:46.033 --> 54:47.944
Oh.

54:48.035 --> 54:49.946
Oh, God.

55:01.173 --> 55:04.336
He's always awake.

55:16.605 --> 55:19.722
First time in 12 years
he hasn't said "thank you."

55:24.446 --> 55:26.858
- Dead.
- How?

55:26.949 --> 55:28.860
Fell off his bed,
didn't he?

55:28.951 --> 55:32.660
- He's a bit dirty, isn't he?
- They all are.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.658
Well,
let's sew him up...

55:35.749 --> 55:38.331
and then see Dorleac.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.921
One, two, three.

55:56.144 --> 55:59.511
Right, let's get Dorleac.

56:04.111 --> 56:07.023
Why'd you lock it?
He's not going anywhere.

56:07.114 --> 56:10.026
I don't know. Habit, I suppose.

56:27.843 --> 56:29.834
Good-bye, priest.

56:29.845 --> 56:31.801
You're free now,

56:33.557 --> 56:36.048
as I will never be.

56:57.706 --> 57:00.869
So the old pope has finally gone
to St. Peter's.

57:02.044 --> 57:04.581
Well, bring him along.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.912
- Let's bury him, then.
- You ready?

57:06.924 --> 57:09.085
One. That's it.

57:13.722 --> 57:17.260
- Keep going.
- Come on, come on. I haven't got all day.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.058
Actually, I do.

57:22.731 --> 57:25.939
I've got...

57:26.026 --> 57:30.269
I've got all the time
in the world!

57:45.087 --> 57:46.998
Come on.

57:48.757 --> 57:50.668
Come on.

58:04.940 --> 58:06.976
Monsieur Dorleac!

58:06.984 --> 58:10.351
Heavenly Father,
we bequeath to you...

58:10.445 --> 58:13.687
these remains
of your humble servant.

58:14.908 --> 58:17.445
Whatever his name was.

58:17.536 --> 58:19.447
God, I'm so bored.

58:19.538 --> 58:22.371
Monsieur Dorleac!

58:30.924 --> 58:33.165
Did he, in fact,
have a map?

58:33.260 --> 58:35.467
No, gov.

58:35.554 --> 58:37.715
Where's the, uh...

58:39.891 --> 58:42.473
Stop!

58:42.477 --> 58:44.468
Monsieur Dorleac!

58:44.479 --> 58:46.970
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

58:46.982 --> 58:50.474
After three.

58:50.569 --> 58:53.356
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- And th...

58:53.447 --> 58:56.530
- Don't, Mr. Dorleac!
- One...

58:56.616 --> 59:00.234
- two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!

59:00.328 --> 59:02.740
- Aah!
- Three!

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:42.256
We could have handled that
a bit better.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.039
Thank you, priest.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.292
Thank you.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.079
So, mi amice,

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.537
I would ask who you are, but in
view of your shredded clothes...

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.999
and the fact that
the Chateau d'If is two miles away,

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:03.841
what's the point?

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:08.719
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa,
a smuggler and a thief.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:12.175
My men and I have come to this island
to bury alive one of our number...

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:15.054
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.351
instead of, uh, sharing it
with his comrades.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:20.897
Interestingly enough, there are some
of his more loyal friends...

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.020
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy,

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:25.067
which, of course,
I cannot do,

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.567
for I would quickly lose control
of the whole crew.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:33.076
- That's why you are such a fortunate find.
- Why is that?

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:36.579
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy to Jacopo,

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.918
that maggot you see
tied up over there,

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:42.122
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:45.880
And as a special treat, the lads will
get to see a little sport as well.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:48.053
How do I accomplish
all this?

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:51.427
We watch you and Jacopo
fight to the death.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:54.430
If Jacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.395
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live,

01:02:57.482 --> 01:03:00.394
even if he did not
take advantage of it,

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:03.443
and you can take his place
on the boat.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.937
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:09.399
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.286
I find that smuggling
is the life for me...

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:16.115
and would be delighted
to kill your friend, the maggot.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:20.836
Oh, uh, by the way, Jacopo is the
best knife fighter I've ever seen.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.879
Perhaps you should
get out more.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.587
Release Jacopo
and give him back his knife.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.638
Then we let
the games begin.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:36.093
Get up, maggot.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.651
Come on, come on!

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:08.375
As you hope to live,
do not move an eyelash.

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:13.380
Senor Vampa,
allow Jacopo to live.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:17.388
He's already suffered enough
with the prospect of being buried alive.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.642
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.731
Those who wanted mercy
for Jacopo will get it.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.400
And by keeping me
and Jacopo,

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:29.821
you will have yet another skilled sailor
and fighter for your crew.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.653
It's a deal.

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:39.160
- What is his name?
- You've got the devil, Jacopo!

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:43.334
His name?
We shall call him Zatarra.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:47.581
- Sounds fearsome.
- It means driftwood.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.006
I swear
on my dead relatives,

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:55.339
even on the ones
that are not feeling too good,

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.970
I am your man forever.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.185
I know.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:27.045
Eyes in the back of your head.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.838
Have you never seen
Marseilles before?

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.888
It was my home.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:40.383
But you do not join
the others ashore.

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:44.266
- Over here!
- Listen to me, Zatarra.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:48.566
Whatever happened to you, you cannot make
it right by staying here on this boat.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.986
Go. It's up to you.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.408
"We are kings or pawns,"
a man once said.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.576
Si.
Who told you this?

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:03.031
Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:07.414
Bonaparte?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:12.999
Oh, Zatarra,
the stories you tell.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.297
Someday I may come
to find you.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:22.384
A man is always in need
of a good friend.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.727
Truly.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.616
Danglars, what's happened?

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:47.201
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,
and Edmond Dantes disobeyed my orders.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:14.060
Zatarra,
are you all right?

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.066
Everything's changed.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.868
I want you to buy a boat,
just something the two of us can handle.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:26.449
Wait for me to return.
I make my next visit alone.

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.831
Is... Is this the home
of Monsieur Morell?

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:38.209
My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.679
Even if he were, he would not receive
visitors at 11:00 in the evening.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:44.049
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.722
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:51.390
I apologize
for the hour.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:53.896
Old people never sleep.
Sit down, sit down.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:57.942
Julianne, some sherry.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:01.069
So, Monsieur Zatarra,

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.534
you were a friend
of Edmond?

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:05.950
- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:20.301
You knew... Edmond also?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.299
Like a son.

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:29.595
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.643
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.477
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:38.937
I see.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.939
I see.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.906
And...

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:48.662
this...
treason you speak of...

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.582
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:55.249
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.002
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.082
of chief prosecutor.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:03.426
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.095
may also have spurred
his departure.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.765
They were strange times.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:14.981
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.693
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:22.193
One of my captains.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.649
And then one day,
Danglars forced me out.

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:30.654
My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:35.705
Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:42.129
I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.336
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.303
- Countess?
- Yes.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:52.305
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.604
Mercedes wed
his best friend.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.315
- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:01.315
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:04.318
Fernand became Count Mondego.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.987
They live in Paris now.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:10.494
Count and Countess Mondego.

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.205
Are you all right?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.878
Yes. I must go.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:26.052
- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.596
You told me
what I needed to know.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:32.808
Edmond Dantes is dead.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:46.197
Zatarra.
Zatarra, you will be so proud of me.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:49.196
I found a nice little skiff.
We couldn't afford a sloop.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.699
Got a really good deal.
Za-Zatarra?

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.537
Zatarra.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:41.076
Whoo-hoo!

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.086
Zatarra, the boat
cannot hold no more,

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.010
and there are at least
eight more boatloads down there!

01:13:57.308 --> 01:14:00.095
Do you not understand?

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:04.391
You are wealthier than any man
I have ever heard of.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:09.814
Whatever your problems were,
they are over.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:13.317
What do you want to buy?

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.318
Revenge.

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:18.401
Okay, revenge. Who?

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.449
Danglars, Villefort,

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:23.448
Fernand and Mercedes.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:25.453
Right.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.331
We kill these people,
then we spend the treasure.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:32.335
No, we will study them,
learn their weaknesses.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.838
Why not just kill them?
I'll do it.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:37.671
I'll run up to Paris...
bam, bam, bam, bam!

01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:40.507
I'm back before week's end.
We spend the treasure.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.512
How is this a bad plan?

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:45.686
Death is too good for them.

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:48.606
They must suffer
as I suffered.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.355
They must see their world,
all they hold dear,

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.936
ripped from them
as it was ripped from me.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:02.741
You will need a better name than Zatarra
if you are to accomplish that.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.162
Then I shall
become a count.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.734
I bid you
good afternoon, sir.

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.904
I'm here to purchase
your lovely home.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:42.827
The very cheek!
I shall have you horsewhipped!

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.663
Now, get off my property,
you vagabond,

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.537
before I set the dogs on you,
you hear?

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.712
Thank you.

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.909
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:16.495
it is with great honor
that I present to you His Grace,

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.582
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.439
It's so beautiful.

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:46.168
Greetings.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:56.221
My dear count, allow me to introduce
to you my husband,

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.439
Monsieur Villefort,
Chief Prosecutor.

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:00.436
Very kind of you
to think of us.

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.394
Oh, I am the one honored
with your presence.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.693
Now, please,
enjoy yourselves tonight.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.863
What do we know about him?

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.862
Not enough.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:15.239
Where are they?
Are you sure you invited them?

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:17.245
Yes, Your Grace.

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:21.420
But I just learned that Count Mondego
has retired for the evening.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.789
He has a morning appointment
he cannot miss.

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:04.372
You're up early, my dear.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:07.417
Is the Viscount Tourville dead?

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:11.637
Unless his heart is situated somewhere
other than the left side of his chest,

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.722
I suspect he is.

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:18.428
God grant him peace.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:21.264
He did no more than defend
his family's honor.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:24.691
Much good it did him.

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:29.021
His wife and I were happy in our
passion. You were happy in your ignorance.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.858
Now comes the viscount's
valiant defense of his honor,

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.863
and you are pained.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:37.037
- She is ruined, and he is dead.
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:41.618
I was neither happy
nor ignorant,

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:45.455
having known about the last three women
before Madame Tourville.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:48.461
I'm sorry you
are humiliated.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:53.971
The combination of Paris
and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity.

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:57.341
And since my attempts at discretion
have evidently failed,

01:20:57.353 --> 01:21:00.470
there seems little point
in keeping up pretenses.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:06.016
It's actually quite...
liberating.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:07.984
Wouldn't you say?

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:12.318
His finances?

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.650
He's losing money
at the other casinos.

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.656
They're not even
cheating him.

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:18.658
Have you looked
into his shipping?

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.536
He got a bank loan for his own boat
several years ago.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:24.994
- Doesn't use Danglars.
- Make sure we own that bank by tomorrow.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:29.002
Tell the other shipping
companies to stay away from Mondego.

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:31.675
I want to give him no choice
but to crawl back to Danglars.

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:36.131
Now, tell the dealers...
take it all.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.681
Do try to understand.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:44.680
I have a very large
consignment of cotton ready to be sent,

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:48.275
and I shall make my payment on the ship
as soon as it is delivered.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:52.355
So obviously I need the vessel
in order to deliver it.

01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:56.951
Unfortunately, the bank can offer
no further extensions, Count Mondego.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:00.495
I suggest you find
alternate means of shipping.

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:13.084
Well, well. To what do I owe the honor,
Count Mondego?

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:17.012
Can't imagine why you've been
avoiding me after all these years.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.762
I'm prepared
to overlook your faults...

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.764
and perhaps resume
our dealings.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.477
Business not going
so well these days?

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.703
Zatarra?

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.421
Jacopo.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.594
Did you fall off the bed?

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:02.342
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:05.519
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.099
Did you come here
for a reason?

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:12.647
Mondego has a son.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:23.112
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.785
Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:28.784
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:32.663
I don't recall hearing your complaints when
I elevated you from a fishmonger's daughter.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.999
Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:38.005
May I remind you, my love, that in
Paris there are mistresses aplenty,

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.554
but you have
only one son.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.553
Come in, Albert.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:48.680
- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:52.813
Several of my friends are going to
Rome for two weeks during Carnival.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.980
- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:58.690
- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.196
Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.322
- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:06.822
Of course he can go. I could do with
some peace and quiet around here.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.661
Rome!

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:33.019
Albert! Albert!

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.567
- Over here! Over here!
- Over here!

01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.410
Milady?

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:31.247
Can't hide forever.

01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:33.246
Milady?

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.337
Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:44.340
- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:48.845
Not anymore. Besides, it's not
your money we're interested in.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:51.847
You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:54.850
Ransom?
Send your note and be damned.

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:58.854
I wish it were that easy, but a note
won't reach your father for two weeks,

01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:02.312
and then there's the endless debates
about whether we killed you already.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:07.819
No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:10.495
Yes. My ring bears
the Mondego crest.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.621
While still attached to your finger?

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:19.166
Listen to me, vermin.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.964
I am Albert, son of Fernand,
Count Mondego,

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:26.052
and you have had your last laugh
at my expense.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:30.132
- Do your worst.
- If you insist. Peppone, the knife.

01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:50.823
Cut this boy's ropes,

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:54.406
or I will be forced to start cutting
your miserable corpses.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.412
Now!

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:02.710
Follow me, young man.
You see the surface? Wait for me there.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:05.668
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Go. We'll talk later.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.342
Well done, gentlemen.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:20.433
Many thanks, Your Grace.

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.438
Albert.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.691
Are you all right?

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:28.364
Sir, I owe you my life.

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.450
You've had quite an ordeal.

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:33.153
You're an extraordinary young man.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.200
I insist, you must come to my estate
for breakfast tomorrow.

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.918
Agreed?

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.917
Agreed.

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.716
May I ask
who you are, sir?

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.053
For the present, your friend.
Tomorrow, your host.

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:52.889
For the short time
formality stands between us,

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:55.183
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:30.135
He's out in the waiting room.

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:33.805
He showed courage
in the tunnels.

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:36.304
He's a means to an end.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.890
Yes, Your Grace.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.776
Young man.

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:52.028
Albert, come in. Come, come.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:55.281
Come on.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.704
- You've had quite a night.
- Yes.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.952
What an adventure.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.702
Everything's an adventure
when you're young.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:05.333
- One thing puzzles me, sir.
- Hmm.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:07.835
How did you come to know
of my kidnapping?

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.292
I have many connections,

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:13.170
some of which
are less than reputable.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:17.850
I pay well to be informed of anything
of note in any city in which I stay.

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:20.473
And the kidnapping
of a count's son is of note.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.561
But why risk your life
rescuing me?

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:28.018
The son
of a fellow noble.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.024
It was the least
I could do.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:34.074
Judging by your character,
I'm sure you would have done the same.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.993
Your father will
be proud of you.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:53.210
You must come to Paris and meet my
parents so they may thank you in person.

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:57.048
Unfortunately, I cannot.
Business, you see.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:59.724
Please, it is
a matter of honor.

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:05.851
- Jacopo?
- Yes, Your Grace?

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:08.183
The Spada matter...
where do we stand?

01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:11.020
- Even now, the gold...
- The shipment?

01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:14.694
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Your Grace.
The shipment is in transit,

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:17.696
uh, bound for Marseilles.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:21.700
- And it arrives?
- Not for another three weeks, Your Grace.

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.871
Three weeks? That's more
than enough time to visit in Paris.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.629
- Very well.
- Excellent.

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:33.379
- And you'll be there just in time.
- In time for?

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:54.229
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:59.489
The Count of Monte Cristo.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.162
Count!

01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:20.513
- Albert.
- Your Grace. Father!

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.637
May I present
the Count of Monte Cristo.

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:26.765
- 'Tis a pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine, Count Mondego.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:30.189
I've been looking forward
to this moment for some time.

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:32.858
You do me much honor,
when it is I who are indebted to you...

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:35.688
for the rescue of my son.

01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:41.151
May I present
the Countess Mondego.

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.707
Mercedes.

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.675
Countess.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:08.312
You would have to be a mother
to truly appreciate the service...

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:11.140
you've done
for my son and me.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:13.816
Monsieur, I shall never forget you.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.402
Please, madame,

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.400
it was nothing.

01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:22.234
I am sure that within a month,
you will not even remember my name.

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:25.070
Hmm?

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.247
May I steal your wife?

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:30.370
- I'm sorry?
- For the waltz.

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.623
Of course.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:39.672
Isn't he wonderful, Father?

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:56.526
- What's the matter?
- Uh, nothing.

01:32:56.613 --> 01:33:00.481
You just remind me
of someone from long ago,

01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:05.235
someone who was
very dear to me.

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:08.534
I'm flattered.
What happened to him?

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:11.248
He died.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.203
But I'm not that man.

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:18.290
Monsieur and Madame Villefort.

01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:23.298
What are they doing here?

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:36.645
Prosecutor Villefort.

01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:40.069
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Madame Villefort, monsieur.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:43.065
I'm so glad you could come to see me
while I'm still in town.

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.443
- We were delightfully surprised
to get your note. - Thank you.

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:50.201
Would you be so kind as to excuse
your husband and I for a moment?

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:56.082
I'm told you are an expert in
the interpretation of the law.

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:59.627
I have a certain matter that
perhaps you could help me with.

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:09.549
Excuse me.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:14.513
Fernand. Fernand!
The toast!

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:17.599
Not right now.
I have state business to attend to.

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.773
Our guests expect it.
Albert expects it.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.192
You give it, my dear.
I'm sure it'll be splendid.

01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:25.615
You are his father!

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:29.531
It is the least you can do.
You know how he admires you.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.613
Then he will forgive
my absence.

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:33.455
But...

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.877
I thought we agreed
not to meet socially.

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:42.920
How could I pass up
the Count of Monte Cristo?

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:47.177
Quite.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:50.382
- What do you know of him?
- He's foreign,

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:52.842
rich.

01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:55.144
I hear he aided
your son.

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:58.811
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:02.520
When my son
returned from Rome,

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:05.981
he mentioned he'd heard Monte Cristo
saying he was expecting a shipment.

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:08.657
He also heard the words "gold"...

01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:10.531
and "Spada."

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.407
- Hmm.
- You don't believe...

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:17.992
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:21.170
Not an hour ago, he asked me to help
him avoid troublesome inspections...

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:23.714
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:26.258
- Hmm.
- I could have him arrested.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:30.214
Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:33.926
- How do you propose... - I have an
acquaintance who deals in these matters.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.602
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:39.726
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:43.522
I shall have it removed and taken
to my old family estate in Bouchon,

01:35:43.529 --> 01:35:46.066
where we shall meet
the following day.

01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:51.947
I require 70 percent.

01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:54.199
And yet you'll only get 50.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:56.201
Done.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:07.045
Yes, it is, isn't it?

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:19.308
Yes, well, I know. Yes.

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:26.311
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:29.739
unfortunately, my husband has been
detained by business.

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:35.662
And so it is
left up to me to...

01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:37.909
To introduce you...

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:40.413
to the Count of Monte Cristo
yet again.

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:44.254
You see, I had the audacity
to beg the count...

01:36:44.257 --> 01:36:47.090
to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:50.919
I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:53.763
that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:56.091
in order to accommodate a guest,

01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:58.096
even one as boorish
as myself.

01:36:58.187 --> 01:37:00.849
Ahh.

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.976
Young Albert
has made far too much...

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:05.649
of the assistance
I gave him in Rome.

01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:07.648
When I arrived
in the catacombs,

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:10.776
I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:13.529
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:15.530
as evidence
of his abduction.

01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:17.452
Goodness!

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.783
The boy's reply to all this was...
"Do your worst."

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:27.130
Life is a storm,
my young friend.

01:37:27.133 --> 01:37:29.374
You will bask
in the sunlight one moment,

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:32.131
be shattered on the rocks
the next.

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:34.299
What makes you a man...

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:37.803
is what you do
when that storm comes.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:41.682
You must look into that storm
and shout, as you did in Rome,

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:44.021
"Do your worst...

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.019
for I will do mine."

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:49.978
Then the fates will know you
as we know you,

01:37:50.073 --> 01:37:53.657
as Albert Mondego,
the man.

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:36.900
Giddap!

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:59.013
Edmond, Villefort told me
that you were executed.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.592
- Did he?
- Oh, God.

01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:05.144
- Countess, you are mistaken.
Back to the Mondegos'. - No!

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:07.605
- Madame, I'm only thinking
of your reputation. - I beg you, Edmond.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:09.599
- I don't care how you returned.
- I am not this Edmond.

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:13.858
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:23.871
So, what are you?

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:29.203
A spirit?
Some ghost sent to torment me?

01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:34.294
This Edmond,
you loved him?

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:36.293
Yes.

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.628
For how long?

01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:41.465
For all of my life.

01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:45.768
And how long after he died
before you married the count?

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.305
That isn't fair.

01:39:53.738 --> 01:39:57.230
We've reached your home,
Countess.

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:18.343
You're right.
You cannot be my Edmond.

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:21.592
Well, there you are.
You said it yourself.

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.843
Edmond Dantes is dead.
Good night.

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:30.058
Countess.

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:37.729
If you ever again presume
to interfere in my affairs,

01:40:37.823 --> 01:40:41.361
I will, I promise, finish the job
I started the day we met.

01:40:41.369 --> 01:40:44.532
Do you understand?

01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:46.954
- I understand you are mad.
- Mad?

01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:50.078
My enemies are falling
into my traps perfectly.

01:40:50.086 --> 01:40:52.077
Mad, Your Grace,
for ignoring this:

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:55.709
You have a fortune,
a beautiful woman who loves you.

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:58.879
Take the money,
take the woman and live your life.

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:01.302
Stop this plan.
Take what you have won.

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:05.382
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.937
I am still your man, Zatarra.

01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:19.938
I swore an oath.
I will protect you.

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:25.243
Even if it means I must
protect you from yourself.

01:41:25.246 --> 01:41:28.909
I'll drive you home now.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.992
I'll walk.

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:14.455
Put two chests
on the Pharaon for our cut.

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:16.953
Mondego will never notice.

01:42:38.235 --> 01:42:40.726
Come on.
Get aboard.

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:51.162
- Philippe Danglars?
- Yeah?

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:56.117
You are charged with the theft of goods
from a certain merchant ship.

01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:00.254
This is absurd.

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:02.332
We can resolve
this matter easily.

01:43:02.426 --> 01:43:05.964
These men will perform
a search of your vessel.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:14.848
Count Mondego set me up.

01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:18.932
But I'll not hang for him.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:37.704
Who are you?

01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:42.414
I'm the Count of Monte Cristo.
But my friends call me Edmond Dantes.

01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:45.041
Dantes?

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:53.132
Cut him down before
he can't talk.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.582
Boy, don't do that.
That's... That's too much.

01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:20.751
My dear Villefort.

01:44:20.838 --> 01:44:23.454
I hope you don't mind
if I join you for a short while.

01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:27.425
Your Grace,
I was not expecting you.

01:44:27.511 --> 01:44:31.345
I want to thank you in person
for helping me with my shipment.

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:34.469
That, yes. I-I made all
the arrangements earlier.

01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:37.139
I can promise you there'll be
no more problems from our end.

01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:42.940
Excellent. I think this could be the
start of a long and fruitful relationship.

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:47.437
Speaking of which,
may I pose a question?

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:49.692
Yes, of course.
Anything in the world.

01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:55.361
I was just curious.

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:59.324
Why did you tell
Countess Mondego 16 years ago...

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:02.623
that Edmond Dantes
had been executed?

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:04.624
Hmm?

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:08.458
Uh, I don't understand.
Wh-What on earth are you talking about?

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:11.669
It's a perfectly
simple question.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.466
How do you know these things?

01:45:15.267 --> 01:45:18.134
That's, uh...

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:20.636
That's quite enough.

01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:24.064
Whew! You don't understand. Dantes
was accepting a letter from Napoleon.

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:27.188
- That was clearly treason.
- But we both know he never delivered it.

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:30.563
Packing a man off to prison with such
knowledge is bad enough. But to tell...

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:33.491
Your Grace, I have no idea what is
provoking this perverse discussion.

01:45:33.494 --> 01:45:37.988
Now I ask myself, "What did my old
friend Villefort stand to gain...

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:41.415
by telling Mercedes
that Edmond Dantes is dead?"

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:46.662
The answer is...
absolutely nothing.

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:49.256
Just as you say, nothing.
So why...

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:51.880
But if my old friend,
now chief prosecutor of France,

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:54.503
doesn't gain from this lie,
well, who does?

01:45:56.684 --> 01:45:59.676
My dear Count, it's far too hot in here
and you're fully dressed.

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:02.557
- It's time we both left.
- I think the clearest beneficiary...

01:46:02.565 --> 01:46:04.601
is Fernand, Count Mondego.

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.696
I don't understand what this inquisition
has to do with our business relationship.

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:14.031
I'm about to tell you.

01:46:17.079 --> 01:46:19.035
Sit down, Mondego.

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:23.408
I'm an ambitious man.
And I have furthered these ambitions...

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:25.660
by scooping up Bonapartists.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:29.038
But now with Napoleon
on the loose, I have,

01:46:29.133 --> 01:46:31.624
shall I say,
a thorn in my side.

01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:34.756
Once merely an irritation,
now potentially lethal.

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:37.596
- Be lethal in turn.
- Well, the problem is such...

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:40.091
that I, myself,
cannot attend to it.

01:46:40.185 --> 01:46:42.392
So I have a proposition
for you.

01:46:47.026 --> 01:46:49.267
How is your father?

01:46:49.278 --> 01:46:51.894
Alive, unfortunately.

01:46:51.906 --> 01:46:55.069
We share the same misfortune.

01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:01.366
You remember?

01:47:13.344 --> 01:47:15.801
Why is this door locked?

01:47:15.804 --> 01:47:18.420
I demand that you release me
from this room at once.

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:20.423
You've proved yourself
no friend of mine.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:23.426
Your father was a loyal supporter
of Napoleon, wasn't he?

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.432
Possibly involved in plotting
Napoleon's escape from Elba.

01:47:26.523 --> 01:47:29.356
The emperor arrives soon!

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:32.435
An inconvenient
parent for an ambitious civil servant.

01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:36.940
But then he died, suddenly and opportunely
murdered, again some 16 years ago.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:40.535
The Emperor Napoleon.

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:46.491
The murderer never apprehended.
How hard did you look for him?

01:47:46.502 --> 01:47:49.164
You have no proof,
no witnesses.

01:47:49.254 --> 01:47:52.496
You just have theories.
J-Just conjectures.

01:47:52.508 --> 01:47:54.965
On the contrary.
I have Count Mondego.

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:59.844
Young Mondego. Why?

01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.339
Because your son
lacked the courage.

01:48:04.979 --> 01:48:07.345
Mondego is the one
who pulled the trigger!

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.517
He'd never confess
in a million years!

01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:12.141
You're right,
he wouldn't.

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:16.441
But you just have.

01:48:18.742 --> 01:48:23.486
Monsieur Villefort, you are under
arrest for conspiracy to murder.

01:48:23.497 --> 01:48:26.989
You remember?

01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:34.288
Dantes?

01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:58.608
A courtesy for a gentleman.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.807
You didn't think
I'd make it that easy, did you?

01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:29.806
Hyah!

01:49:47.039 --> 01:49:49.200
Edmond?

01:49:55.547 --> 01:49:58.960
I thought we had finished our
conversation in the carriage.

01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:01.800
So did I.

01:50:03.138 --> 01:50:05.971
Until I realized...

01:50:07.059 --> 01:50:11.268
you said the name "Dantes."

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:14.855
A name that
I had never mentioned.

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:22.442
What do you want of me?

01:50:22.533 --> 01:50:25.366
I want to be free of you,

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:28.444
the way you obviously
are free of me.

01:50:30.666 --> 01:50:34.158
Just a few answers from you,
and I shall be gone forever.

01:50:36.672 --> 01:50:39.505
Ask your questions.

01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:49.715
Where have you been?

01:50:52.396 --> 01:50:55.888
Thirteen years in
the Chateau d'If...

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:57.939
and everywhere else
you can imagine.

01:51:00.654 --> 01:51:03.987
The Chateau d'If
for 13 years.

01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:09.822
Did you suffer?

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:14.995
Are you finished now?
I have a good deal on my mind.

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:17.246
- What happened afterward?
- Much.

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:19.703
- Why did you not come to me?
- Why did you not wait?

01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:22.252
You married the very man
who betrayed...

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:28.178
I told you that night
on the rocks, remember?

01:51:28.182 --> 01:51:33.677
That it would never leave my finger.
And it never has.

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:37.763
- Why?
- You know why.

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:42.901
If you ever loved me,

01:51:42.905 --> 01:51:45.396
don't...
don't rob me of my hate.

01:51:45.407 --> 01:51:47.398
It's all I have.

01:51:47.409 --> 01:51:52.073
Let it go, Edmond.
Let it go.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.368
I don't know what dark plan
lies within you.

01:51:55.459 --> 01:51:57.950
Nor do I know by what design
we were asked...

01:51:58.045 --> 01:52:00.411
to live without
each other these 16 years.

01:52:00.422 --> 01:52:03.414
- But God has offered us a new beginning...
- God?

01:52:03.508 --> 01:52:06.375
Don't slap His hand away.

01:52:06.386 --> 01:52:08.377
Can I never escape Him?

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:13.382
No. He is in everything.

01:52:15.479 --> 01:52:19.142
Even in a kiss.

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.527
My lady?

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.328
Where's the count?

01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:20.495
Um, the count would like
for you to join him this afternoon.

01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:23.622
- Join him?
- Uh, yes,

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:27.964
in, uh, leaving the country
with your son.

01:53:30.887 --> 01:53:34.129
Mmm, uh, I'll have someone
bring you to your house...

01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:35.839
and you just
wait there for me.

01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:38.183
- And we just...
- Thank you!

01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:40.807
- Yes, yes, but...
- I need to go home and pack.

01:53:40.897 --> 01:53:42.808
Yes, yes. My lady...

01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:49.987
- Where's the count?
- Upstairs, my lady.

01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:00.663
What's wrong?

01:54:00.751 --> 01:54:06.087
I'm bankrupt.
All my debts have been called in.

01:54:06.173 --> 01:54:09.040
- Also, I'm to be arrested.
- For what?

01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:12.043
Piracy, corruption
and murder.

01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:15.675
- Did you do all these things?
- Yes.

01:54:15.766 --> 01:54:18.348
There is simply not time to talk.
The gendarmes are on the way,

01:54:18.435 --> 01:54:21.017
apparently, so hurry up
and pack something.

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:23.512
I'm not going
with you, Fernand.

01:54:32.449 --> 01:54:35.612
You are my wife.

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:38.739
I have made
arrangements for us.

01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:41.739
We shall be very well
taken care of.

01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:44.950
Now go and find my son.

01:54:45.045 --> 01:54:48.458
- He's not your son.
- I beg your pardon?

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:53.383
Albert Mondego is the son
of Edmond Dantes.

01:54:57.933 --> 01:55:03.178
Why do you think I rushed off so quickly
to marry you after Edmond was taken away?

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:16.073
Premature.

01:55:32.968 --> 01:55:36.301
Well, aren't you
a piece of work.

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:41.424
So he's the bastard son
of a dead traitor.

01:55:41.435 --> 01:55:43.426
He always was disappointing.

01:55:56.116 --> 01:56:00.951
Good-bye, Mercedes.
You did please me some of the time.

01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:08.784
You never pleased me.

01:56:59.262 --> 01:57:01.594
What is this?

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:18.027
Monte Cristo.

01:57:21.284 --> 01:57:23.866
King's to you, Fernand.

01:57:31.545 --> 01:57:34.537
Edmond?

01:57:36.299 --> 01:57:38.585
But how...

01:57:38.593 --> 01:57:43.087
How did I escape?
With difficulty.

01:57:43.181 --> 01:57:48.096
How did I plan this moment?
With pleasure.

01:57:48.103 --> 01:57:51.391
So you've taken Mercedes?

01:57:51.398 --> 01:57:53.810
And everything else...

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.856
except your life.

01:57:58.029 --> 01:58:00.065
Why are you doing this?

01:58:00.156 --> 01:58:02.818
It's complicated.

01:58:04.286 --> 01:58:08.575
Let's just say it's vengeance
for the life you stole from me.

01:58:18.967 --> 01:58:21.834
Well, I see someone
has taught you the sword.

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:24.761
How did you ever
call yourself my friend?

01:58:24.848 --> 01:58:28.261
We were friends, Edmond.

01:58:28.268 --> 01:58:31.101
You sent me to hell!

01:58:31.104 --> 01:58:33.095
Why?

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:37.311
Take your vengeance.

01:58:37.402 --> 01:58:40.109
But know the blood
you spill is noble.

01:58:42.032 --> 01:58:44.023
Blood that will never
run through your veins.

01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:46.108
You're no more a count
than I am a commoner!

01:58:54.502 --> 01:58:57.289
You don't have it in you.

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:06.553
- Touch him, and I'll kill you.
- Boy, let me explain.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:10.303
It's been explained. I spoke to
Madame Villefort on the street.

01:59:10.393 --> 01:59:13.180
She told me how I was a silly,
trusting dupe that my friend,

01:59:13.188 --> 01:59:15.645
the Count of Monte Cristo,
used to get into our lives.

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:17.643
- Albert, listen to me.
- I will not!

01:59:17.734 --> 01:59:20.851
Forgive me for being
such a fool, Father.

01:59:20.945 --> 01:59:22.981
You were betrayed.
Of course you're forgiven.

01:59:23.073 --> 01:59:25.234
You were my friend.
I looked up to you.

01:59:25.325 --> 01:59:27.361
There's a history here
you know nothing about.

01:59:27.369 --> 01:59:30.236
He loved your mother,
and yet she chose me.

01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:32.787
- Now he intends to steal her away.
- Lie. Get out of my way!

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:39.327
Boy, if I have to,
I will kill you.

01:59:39.339 --> 01:59:41.500
I will not stop now.

01:59:41.591 --> 01:59:44.333
- Nor will I.
- So be it.

01:59:44.427 --> 01:59:46.634
No!

02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:07.777
Albert,

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:11.735
I found the note you left
explaining where you'd gone.

02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:16.911
But now I must
explain something to you.

02:00:17.001 --> 02:00:19.708
Where you really come from.

02:00:19.713 --> 02:00:23.797
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:33.553
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.898
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:53.485
You are the walking proof that your
mother was as much of a whore...

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.117
in her younger years
as she is today.

02:00:56.124 --> 02:00:58.240
You...

02:01:01.463 --> 02:01:03.499
You let me fight him?

02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:06.423
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

02:01:06.426 --> 02:01:09.133
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

02:01:09.137 --> 02:01:11.093
I want no more of this.

02:01:12.432 --> 02:01:17.096
Just go.
Call it mercy.

02:01:17.187 --> 02:01:19.178
Mercy, Fernand.

02:01:25.445 --> 02:01:30.781
You've only got one shot, and it
will take more than that to stop me.

02:01:30.867 --> 02:01:34.451
Well, then I'd best put it
where it will do the most damage.

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:38.488
No!

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:40.957
Mother! Mother!

02:01:41.044 --> 02:01:44.753
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

02:01:48.468 --> 02:01:50.379
Hyah!

02:01:55.225 --> 02:01:57.341
Once again, Zatarra,

02:01:57.352 --> 02:01:59.684
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

02:01:59.771 --> 02:02:01.636
She'll live.

02:02:34.681 --> 02:02:37.218
Edmond!

02:02:37.225 --> 02:02:40.262
Edmond!

02:02:40.353 --> 02:02:44.096
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:46.272
Edmond, don't go.

02:02:46.359 --> 02:02:49.943
You try.
Don't ever quit.

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.520
Zatarra,

02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:55.695
you must end this.

02:02:57.370 --> 02:03:00.862
Even the priest
will understand that.

02:03:00.874 --> 02:03:04.992
- Edmond!
- Please don't leave.

02:03:07.255 --> 02:03:10.042
Watch over your mother.

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:35.026
Now, I couldn't live in a world where
you have everything and I have nothing.

02:05:15.842 --> 02:05:18.504
What happened
to your mercy?

02:05:18.594 --> 02:05:23.554
I'm a count,
not a saint.

02:06:04.182 --> 02:06:08.676
You were right, priest.
You were right.

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:12.728
This I promise you...

02:06:12.815 --> 02:06:17.229
and God:

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:20.399
All that was used
for vengeance...

02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:24.733
will now be used for good.

02:06:24.827 --> 02:06:29.116
So rest in peace, my friend.

02:06:29.123 --> 02:06:32.411
So, Zatarra,

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:34.579
painful, huh?

02:06:34.670 --> 02:06:37.503
No.

02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:48.135
I bought this place, thinking
one day I would tear it down.

02:06:48.226 --> 02:06:50.933
But now the only things
I care about...

02:06:50.937 --> 02:06:55.431
are walking off
this island with me.

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:58.274
Let's go home.
