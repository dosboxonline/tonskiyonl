01:54.583 --> 01:57.791
[in English] It was not as easy
as we anticipated getting this Novichok.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.125
Custom inspector doubled his price.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.916
Which means harbormaster doubled his.

I just woke up.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.833
What?

04:28.208 --> 04:29.916
When do you think the bump comes?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.750
- Well, I googled a lot last night.
- Mmm.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.916
I did not google that.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.500
I hope soon.

I love a baby bump.

Okay, up.

- Okay.
- It's gonna be a busy one.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.374
Go make coffee.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.875
I hate to tell you this,

Not in the Christmas spirit?

05:14.958 --> 05:17.374
Historically? Never.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.707
But this Christmas is an exception.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.832
This Christmas
is a full-tank Merry Christmas.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.333
It's a happy Christmas
like they have in England.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.333

06:08.208 --> 06:09.541
You know, like, in life.

06:10.916 --> 06:15.166
Have a plan, have a career, have a dog.

You want a dog?

You don't?

Getting closer, Walter.
Almost killed me that time.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.000
Why the academy all of a sudden?

07:35.625 --> 07:38.208
Because it was the last time
you were excited about your life.

07:40.375 --> 07:43.249
You checked the mail so many times,
you knew the mailman by name.

07:43.250 --> 07:46.374
I always knew Harry. We're like that.

07:46.375 --> 07:50.665
It was like you could see a future
and you couldn't wait for it.

07:50.666 --> 07:53.374
And the second that you didn't get in,
that guy checked out.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.541
You miss him?

07:56.333 --> 07:57.457
You miss him.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.290
Well, they rejected me.

07:59.291 --> 08:00.333
Once.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.666
You applied once.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.250
How many times did you ask me out?

08:08.583 --> 08:11.291
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:12.416 --> 08:14.916
You followed me to LA
when I got a job here.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.875
And then you took a job at the same place
so we could have lunch together.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.500
- That was three years ago.
- I like having lunch with you.

08:31.916 --> 08:33.333
You asked me out.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.291
Just, you know, saying.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.750
Just do me a favor and think about it.

09:08.125 --> 09:09.333

since you told me.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.582
Yeah, it's gonna have to be on the move.

but it feels kind of stupid now.

Um, I've been thinking
about my career trajectory.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.624
Your career trajectory?
All right. I think it's a flat line.

but I'd like to do better,

14:05.916 --> 14:07.291

and you're asking for a promotion.

You're growing
a real set of balls there, young man.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.541
So you decided to participate in life.
Great. Welcome to the shitshow.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.082
I'm not giving you a promotion, okay?

14:45.083 --> 14:47.124
I need guys that give me
more than bare minimum,

14:47.125 --> 14:48.707

14:48.708 --> 14:50.374
- I want to be here.
- No, you don't.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.000
Nice speech though.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.166
And congrats on the kid.

15:02.916 --> 15:05.333
You're right. I haven't shown initiative.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.208
Uh...

15:09.875 --> 15:13.540
And I'm... I came in late today,
like I sometimes do.

15:13.541 --> 15:16.499
But I ranked top level
in threat assessment.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.290
I've never had a complaint and I can
spot a fake better than the LEOs.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.208
What?

15:21.791 --> 15:26.250
I want to be here. I know I do
because I thought about quitting today.

15:27.458 --> 15:31.374
But then I realized that'd be quitting
before I'd even tried, and that's on me.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.958
I've been coasting, but I can do better.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.374
Put me on a machine.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.541
I'll show you I'm more than you think.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.583
- Leads are screening today.
- [sighs]

15:48.291 --> 15:49.958
Then give him my spot.

15:51.541 --> 15:54.166
Yeah, that'll free up

15:55.208 --> 15:59.291

it'll keep us from bottlenecking.

There's someone else at the scanner.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.999
[Traveler] Let me see him.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.916
[Watcher] Sending it to you now.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.000
[Traveler] Stay calm. Pull his file.

19:33.416 --> 19:34.416
[Watcher] Kopek.

19:39.291 --> 19:43.041
Ethan Kopek. 30.
Born in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

19:43.958 --> 19:45.583
<i>Ran high school track.</i>

19:46.416 --> 19:49.833
He's been with the TSA for three years.
No commendations.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.332
No promotions.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.999
[crook] <i>The family is about to leave.</i>

19:54.000 --> 19:56.457
<i>I say we bag 'em
and force the target to resume his post.</i>

19:56.458 --> 20:00.083
[Traveler] That could attract attention.
Show me the alternates.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.583
[Watcher] Lanes one and two
face the LAXPD,

20:04.291 --> 20:06.250
and Ronald Dunn is former military.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.332
[Traveler] Three years
and still entry-level. I know this guy.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.541
[crook] <i>The window's closing.
I need a call. Do I take the family?</i>

20:15.875 --> 20:18.458
[Watcher] He lives on Fifth and Rose.
You're five minutes away.

20:19.125 --> 20:22.457
[Traveler] Okay, let's pivot.
Go to his place, fill in some blanks.

20:22.458 --> 20:25.208
No matter what, this gets done today.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.000
[Jason] No belts, no liquids.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.791
Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.583
This isn't mine.

20:53.666 --> 20:54.666
Uh...

20:57.541 --> 20:58.375
[buzzes]

21:01.625 --> 21:05.000
[security officer] Remove your shoes
and place them in the bin.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.833
I'll add it to the lost and found.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.250
[cell phone chimes]

21:24.291 --> 21:26.291
- [woman] Over there.
- [cell phone chimes]

21:39.708 --> 21:42.790
[Traveler] <i>Ethan, today is a day
that you're going to remember</i>

21:42.791 --> 21:43.957
<i>for a very long time.</i>

21:43.958 --> 21:47.207
<i>But if you handle it right,
you'll have a chance to forget it.</i>

21:47.208 --> 21:48.207
Hello?

21:48.208 --> 21:50.290
<i>One bag for one life.</i>

21:50.291 --> 21:51.374
Excuse me?

21:51.375 --> 21:53.874
<i>That's the deal.
That's what's going to happen.</i>

21:53.875 --> 21:56.332
Mmm. Yeah, nice try, Eddie.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.332
I hope you rap better than you prank
or I'm out two bucks.

21:59.333 --> 22:02.166
<i>Eddie's in lane one,
driving his first Maybach.</i>

22:03.916 --> 22:07.291
[Eddie] Come on, lanes.
See how many bins I got over here...

22:09.083 --> 22:12.500
Pay stubs, bills, family photos.
Anything we can use.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.125
[Traveler] <i>Just relax, okay?</i>

22:22.541 --> 22:25.540
<i>This is how it goes, Ethan.
Soon an associate of mine</i>

22:25.541 --> 22:27.582
<i>is gonna step into your line
with a boarding pass</i>

22:27.583 --> 22:30.874
<i>for Northwind Flight 1850
non-stop to JFK.</i>

22:30.875 --> 22:35.040
<i>You are gonna make sure
that his bag clears the machine.</i>

22:35.041 --> 22:36.540
This is a joke, right?

22:36.541 --> 22:39.374
<i>Is anything I just said funny?</i>

22:39.375 --> 22:40.458
No.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.999
<i>If it's any consolation,
you were not my first choice.</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:46.415
<i>You're not where
you're supposed to be today,</i>

22:46.416 --> 22:49.666
<i>but that is okay. To be honest,
it makes my day a little easier.</i>

22:50.208 --> 22:52.749
Okay. I'll play along.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.499
- What's in the bag?
<i>- Diamonds out of Papua New Guinea.</i>

22:55.500 --> 22:57.082
- Bullshit.
<i>- Okay.</i>

22:57.083 --> 22:58.457
You answered too quickly.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.999
<i>Yeah, maybe because knowing
won't change anything</i>

23:01.000 --> 23:04.583
<i>and I hope I don't have to execute
someone close to you to prove it.</i>

23:05.958 --> 23:09.083
<i>Jason's house is right nearby,
a nice rental on Sixth Street.</i>

23:10.416 --> 23:12.791
<i>Rochelle is home with the twins.</i>

23:14.041 --> 23:16.166
<i>Why don't you ask me
if I know their names?</i>

23:17.333 --> 23:18.374
Who are you?

23:18.375 --> 23:21.957
<i>I'm just a traveler headed home
for the holidays, like everyone else.</i>

23:21.958 --> 23:23.540
<i>Probably a lot like you.</i>

23:23.541 --> 23:25.957
<i>If we met on the softball field,
I bet we'd be buddies.</i>

23:25.958 --> 23:28.957
<i>We'd go out for beers after.
But we're meeting like this.</i>

23:28.958 --> 23:31.457
<i>And I'm telling you how this goes.</i>

23:31.458 --> 23:34.332
<i>Now, keep your voice down
and do exactly as I say.</i>

23:34.333 --> 23:37.166
- And you're watching me right now?
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>

23:37.875 --> 23:39.000
And what am I doing?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.500
You should put that down
before Sarkowski sees it.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.957
I like this kid.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.665
[crook] <i>Okay. I found something.</i>

23:53.666 --> 23:56.749
<i>I've got a pay stub, girlfriend maybe.</i>

23:56.750 --> 23:58.250
<i>Sending it now.</i>

24:03.375 --> 24:05.958
[Watcher] Nora Parisi. Twenty-seven,

24:06.875 --> 24:10.124
recently promoted to manager
of Northwind Operations.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.541
[crook] <i>Wait. I found something else.</i>

24:15.500 --> 24:17.583
Listen, asshole.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.832
I work for
the Department of Homeland Security.

24:21.833 --> 24:25.124
[Traveler] <i>That's like the janitor at NASA
calling himself an astronaut.</i>

24:25.125 --> 24:26.957
<i>You're a low-level TSO,</i>

24:26.958 --> 24:29.624
<i>you're going nowhere,

24:29.625 --> 24:31.250
He's putting a call through.

- [Traveler] <i>Hang up now or Nora dies.</i>
- [line ringing]

24:38.833 --> 24:40.290
What did you just say?

24:40.291 --> 24:43.124
<i>My people have
a Barrett M82 sniper rifle at her head.</i>

24:43.125 --> 24:44.290
<i>Hang up the call...</i>

24:44.291 --> 24:47.416
- [operator] <i>911, what's your emergency?
- ...or we execute your girlfriend.</i>

24:50.125 --> 24:53.624
<i>Your pregnant girlfriend
over at Northwind Operations.</i>

24:53.625 --> 24:55.082
[operator] <i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

24:55.083 --> 24:57.332
[Traveler] <i>I told you this is how it goes.</i>

24:57.333 --> 24:58.500
[operator] <i>Hello?</i>

24:59.875 --> 25:00.874
<i>Hello?</i>

25:00.875 --> 25:03.082
[Traveler] <i>Get up and lock it
in the lost and found.</i>

25:03.083 --> 25:04.166
Okay.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.415
<i>I said lock it.</i>

25:18.416 --> 25:21.832
<i>The quicker you accept this,
Ethan, the safer you and Nora will be.</i>

25:21.833 --> 25:24.125
I accept it. Just be cool, okay?

25:24.875 --> 25:26.915
[passengers clamoring]

25:26.916 --> 25:29.124
[Traveler] <i>Today won't be easy,
but it'll be simple.</i>

25:29.125 --> 25:32.540
<i>When the plane departs at 5:40,
you and Nora are free to live your lives.</i>

25:32.541 --> 25:36.207
<i>If the bag gets flagged, she dies.
If you talk to the police, she dies.</i>

25:36.208 --> 25:37.790
<i>If anyone opens the bag--</i>

25:37.791 --> 25:39.082
Okay. I get it.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.665
<i>Good because I'm watching.</i>

25:40.666 --> 25:43.582
<i>Now, you were a runner.
Pick a track, stay in your lane.</i>

25:43.583 --> 25:46.540
<i>You've never made waves before, Ethan.
You're not going to start now.</i>

25:46.541 --> 25:48.457
<i>One bag for one life.</i>

25:48.458 --> 25:51.458
<i>All you have to do is nothing.</i>

[man on radio] <i>Congresswoman Grace Turner

What the hell?

26:08.166 --> 26:11.165
<i>It's a topic that touches the core

26:11.166 --> 26:13.957
- Sorry.
<i>- ...and national security.</i>

Texting and driving.

26:17.666 --> 26:18.666
Sorry.

26:28.375 --> 26:29.916
What do you got, Detective?

26:30.541 --> 26:34.749
Olek Vedenyapin and his nephew
Yuri Balakin. Olek was Bratva.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.333
Yeah, he ran the port.

26:37.416 --> 26:41.040
We've been trying to connect him to that
double homicide on Hawthorne last year.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.124
Burn pattern suggests
some type of accelerant.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.124
Nephew was shot dead before the fire.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.625
Did you dig up a bullet yet?

26:49.625 --> 26:53.332
Hydra-Shok. Bougie. Same COD as Olek?

26:53.333 --> 26:56.458
We haven't found any other rounds.
ME will have to autopsy.

27:11.583 --> 27:12.708
It's a cricket.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.250
ATF bug. Standalone.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.415
Bugs that broadcast can be easily detected

27:18.416 --> 27:21.999
but this little guy
can record up to 72 hours.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.708
Too bad it's cooked.
It probably recorded the murder.

27:25.666 --> 27:28.000
I know somebody
who might be able to uncook it.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.249
Everyone, the TSA would like to
personally congratulate you

27:36.250 --> 27:37.999

27:44.458 --> 27:46.290
I'm not going through that machine

27:46.291 --> 27:48.790
so you and your perv buddies
can take naked photos.

27:48.791 --> 27:50.707
They always do this.
I'm late for my flight.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.875
I have my student ID. Is that okay?

27:53.625 --> 27:55.457
- Do you have a passport?
- No.

27:55.458 --> 27:59.332
I will not bow to a repressive government
that wants to violate my human rights.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.999
Keys, wallets, personal items.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.082
Put it in a bin!

28:03.083 --> 28:05.290
- Is this 'cause I'm Muslim?
- Is this 'cause I'm Black?

28:05.291 --> 28:06.624
Is this 'cause I'm white?

28:06.625 --> 28:09.999
You're putting on a show down here
so the cameras up there can profile us.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.457
Do I look like a problem to you?

[Traveler] <i>Hey, you seem very tense.</i>

28:27.000 --> 28:28.207
I wonder why.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.707
<i>Well, when travelers see guys like you
get tense, they get tense.</i>

28:31.708 --> 28:35.415
<i>And that's bad for me, which means
it's bad for Nora. Okay? So calm down.</i>

28:35.416 --> 28:38.457
You want me to be calm

out of your mind. Okay?</i>

28:42.125 --> 28:43.874

Yeah, okay.

<i>I sense maybe you're not
a fan of Christmas, right?</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:57.707
It's a holiday that makes
everyone feel they're not doing it right

28:57.708 --> 28:59.165
no matter what they do.

28:59.166 --> 29:04.332
They're never happy enough,
never rich enough, never enough enough.

29:04.333 --> 29:07.957
<i>Bah humbug.
To me, Christmas is all about family.</i>

29:07.958 --> 29:10.707
Really? The anonymous criminal
threatening my pregnant girlfriend's

29:10.708 --> 29:13.708

<i>- That's a fair point.</i>

<i>Attaboy. Now, stand up
and walk over to the drawer</i>

30:26.416 --> 30:28.791
<i>and put the watch in there
next to your phone.</i>

30:32.000 --> 30:33.957
<i>We're off to a real bad start here.</i>

30:33.958 --> 30:36.582
<i>This won't work if I can't trust you.
Understand?</i>

30:36.583 --> 30:37.582
You can trust me.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.874
<i>You sure? 'Cause you've been
lying to me since we met.</i>

30:39.875 --> 30:42.165

<i>I'm the guy you listen to.</i>

The bag stays shut.

Well, you wanted a rush on your cricket
and I wanted peppermint Ho Hos.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.166
They're delicious

31:35.750 --> 31:37.874
and Shira won't buy Christmas flavors.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.125
[Elena] Mmm-hmm.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.500
[exclaims softly]

31:47.250 --> 31:49.875
Oh, my gosh. That is so good.

31:50.583 --> 31:54.040
I'm usually the only one here
on Christmas Eve. Get caught up.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.624
- Shouldn't you be with family?
- Dinner's at 5:00.

31:56.625 --> 31:59.000
Or 4:00, whatev...
What's up with the cricket?

31:59.583 --> 32:00.582
You were right.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.832
ATF's been surveilling this guy
for a while.

32:02.833 --> 32:06.124
Mostly sells arms to Russians.
You think they're behind this?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.332
[Elena] Could be.

32:07.333 --> 32:08.625
But something feels off.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.916
Olek's been steady for years,
reliable for them.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.791
Why would his Russian buddies
kill him now?

32:15.625 --> 32:17.165
You got anything off the bug?

32:17.166 --> 32:20.958
Not much. I took what I could restore,
isolated highs and lows.

32:21.541 --> 32:22.750
Here's what I got.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.750
[imperceptible distorted audio]

32:34.416 --> 32:35.625
[man] <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

32:36.500 --> 32:37.500
That's it.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.332
You don't deserve Ho Hos.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.499
It was in a fire.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.458
This is a Christmas miracle.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.291
Hallelujah.

32:52.875 --> 32:53.750
[girl giggling]

32:56.791 --> 32:58.540
[Ethan] You said you have a family?

32:58.541 --> 33:00.999
[Traveler] <i>No,
I said Christmas is about family.</i>

33:01.000 --> 33:04.290
<i>- But I do have a son.</i>
- Does he know what you do for a living?

33:04.291 --> 33:06.290
<i>- He thinks I'm in insurance.
-</i> [scoffs]

33:06.291 --> 33:09.041
<i>But that's not what
you really want to ask, is it?</i>

33:12.458 --> 33:13.457
Are you a terrorist?

33:13.458 --> 33:14.832
<i>No, Ethan, I'm not.</i>

33:14.833 --> 33:18.207
<i>I consider myself
more of a freelance facilitator. Okay?</i>

33:18.208 --> 33:19.374
What does that mean?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.832
<i>Clients hire me
to facilitate a specific result.</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:23.249
<i>It varies from job to job.</i>

33:23.250 --> 33:25.332
And what's the result you're after now?

33:25.333 --> 33:27.041
<i>Get a bag on a plane.</i>

33:28.708 --> 33:29.540
Right.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.457
<i>What about you?</i>

33:30.458 --> 33:33.624
<i>You've been on autopilot
for a while now. Why don't you quit?</i>

33:33.625 --> 33:34.957
I will if you will.

33:34.958 --> 33:38.790
<i>No, I'm serious. A smart guy like you
had to have aspirations at some point.</i>

33:38.791 --> 33:41.207
<i>What'd you have pinned up
on that vision board?</i>

33:41.208 --> 33:45.041
Well, you're the one who knows everything.
Why don't you tell me? Huh?

33:45.791 --> 33:46.624
<i>All right.</i>

33:46.625 --> 33:49.457
<i>You're a son of a security guard,
you're observant.</i>

33:49.458 --> 33:51.000
<i>How about... cop?</i>

33:53.875 --> 33:55.083
<i>I'm right, aren't I?</i>

33:55.958 --> 33:57.583
<i>Yeah, tell me what happened.</i>

33:59.375 --> 34:00.790
I didn't make the cut.

34:00.791 --> 34:03.000
They kicked me out right before placement.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.832
<i>Oh. Why would they
go and do a thing like that?</i>

34:05.833 --> 34:07.124
<i>- What'd you do?</i>
- Next question.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.582
[chuckles] <i>A nerve hit. Okay.</i>

34:09.583 --> 34:11.874
<i>You tell me when you're ready.
Was that it?</i>

34:11.875 --> 34:15.041
<i>Did you ever reapply
or is that a touchy story too?</i>

34:16.750 --> 34:18.499
My dad wanted to be a cop.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.291
Applied so many times
they flat out stopped responding.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.374
You know what he does now?
Of course you do.

34:26.375 --> 34:27.875
<i>He drives an Uber.</i>

34:28.666 --> 34:29.582
Yeah.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.999
<i>So the world kicks him down,
you lie down next to him. Why is that?</i>

34:33.000 --> 34:34.916
Dreams have an expiration date.

34:36.791 --> 34:39.624
<i>I bet it's started to
eat at your relationship with Nora.</i>

34:39.625 --> 34:42.290
<i>I bet she loves all the cynicism.</i>
[munching]

34:42.291 --> 34:44.499
She has a different outlook.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.249
<i>I'm not saying chase your dreams.</i>

34:46.250 --> 34:48.457
<i>- That's not a very honest thing to say...</i>
- [baby crying]

34:48.458 --> 34:51.915
<i>...but there is no need to hate
every minute of waking life.</i>

34:51.916 --> 34:53.999
<i>Your generation is just so taken</i>

34:54.000 --> 34:56.624
<i>- with the concept of authenticity...
-</i> [hip-hop music playing]

34:56.625 --> 34:58.624
<i>...that you will not take a bite</i>

34:58.625 --> 35:01.750
<i>unless you know
it's the perfect hashtag real thing.</i>

35:02.333 --> 35:05.832
<i>Real coffee, real pizza, real bagel.</i>

35:05.833 --> 35:09.665
<i>The thing you kids haven't
come around to is that there's no real.</i>

35:09.666 --> 35:13.540
<i>Fulfillment is a lie
that they use to sell paper towels.</i>

35:13.541 --> 35:14.790
Hey, now who's cynical?

35:14.791 --> 35:17.457
<i>No, I'm just experienced enough
to know life's disappointing,</i>

35:17.458 --> 35:19.332
<i>and it's short and if you're smart,</i>

35:19.333 --> 35:21.999
<i>you can steal
what happiness you can when you can.</i>

35:22.000 --> 35:25.165
<i>Or just stay on autopilot
the rest of your life. Your call.</i>

35:25.166 --> 35:27.125
[crockery breaking]

35:30.125 --> 35:31.458
[buzzes]

35:32.208 --> 35:33.166
[baby crying]

35:34.833 --> 35:36.166
[Traveler munching]

35:37.500 --> 35:40.915
<i>You know, the lucky ones find a job
that pays the most money...</i>

35:40.916 --> 35:42.082
[arcade game beeping]

35:42.083 --> 35:43.708
<i>...for the least amount of work.</i>

35:45.125 --> 35:48.582
<i>And they spend the rest of their time
doing whatever makes them happy.</i>

35:48.583 --> 35:51.041
[Traveler munching]

35:52.416 --> 35:53.416
Like you.

35:54.291 --> 35:57.083
[Traveler] You'd be surprised
how well I live.

35:58.583 --> 36:01.625
Does it take a doctorate
to read a computer screen? Let's go.

36:04.750 --> 36:07.458
- I need a LEO on four. Bag check.
- This is unreal.

36:11.125 --> 36:14.457
It's called a book. You might read one
when you get your GED.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.665
Buddy, relax. Let the guy work.

36:16.666 --> 36:19.291
Sir, could I see
your boarding pass, please?

36:20.875 --> 36:23.290
Mr. Herter, I need to conduct
a quick inspection.

36:23.291 --> 36:25.374
If you prefer,
we can use a private room.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.540
No, do it here.
I'm already late to board.

36:27.541 --> 36:30.290
In that case,
I'll have a law enforcement officer

36:30.291 --> 36:33.375
run your boarding pass while I search.

36:35.625 --> 36:36.790
It'll save time.

36:36.791 --> 36:38.499
I don't think this is necessary.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.750
New fraud alert from SFO.

36:41.750 --> 36:42.750
Yeah.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.541
[Traveler munching]

36:59.291 --> 37:00.291
Okay.

37:01.083 --> 37:04.291
You're all clear.
Probably just an imaging glitch.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.208
You TSA guys are a joke.

37:08.250 --> 37:11.000
- You know that, right?
- Thank you for your patience.

37:11.916 --> 37:14.250
You can wait over there
for your boarding pass.

37:19.416 --> 37:22.375
[Traveler] <i>There's a story I once heard
about a tribe in the Serengeti.</i>

37:25.666 --> 37:27.207
<i>Every summer when the game was sparse,</i>

37:27.208 --> 37:30.040
<i>the tribe would depend on a single
apple tree for most of its food.</i>

37:30.041 --> 37:33.290
<i>Then one day they learned
that the tree had been plucked bare.</i>

37:33.291 --> 37:36.250
<i>The apples had been stolen
by one of their own.</i>

37:37.083 --> 37:38.582
<i>"I'm sorry," the thief pled.</i>

37:38.583 --> 37:41.582
<i>"I needed those apples
to feed my children."</i>

37:41.583 --> 37:46.249
<i>The tribe forgave him and made do
until the tree bore fruit once more.</i>

37:46.250 --> 37:49.541
<i>They returned, and lo and behold,
what'd they see?</i>

37:50.208 --> 37:53.125
<i>The apples were gone again.
Pilfered by the same thief.</i>

37:54.166 --> 37:55.665
<i>"I'm sorry," the thief begged.</i>

37:55.666 --> 37:57.916
<i>"I needed those apples
to feed my children."</i>

37:58.583 --> 38:02.166
<i>Even though the tribe was
without food yet again, they forgave him.</i>

38:03.083 --> 38:05.290
<i>When the apples grew back,</i>

38:05.291 --> 38:08.707
<i>the tribe's elders knew
the thief would return.</i>

38:08.708 --> 38:09.708
<i>Excuse me.</i>

38:14.500 --> 38:16.666
<i>So, when night fell,</i>

38:17.458 --> 38:19.374
<i>they crept into the man's hut</i>

38:19.375 --> 38:21.666
<i>and slit the throats
of all three children.</i>

38:23.416 --> 38:25.416
<i>You want to know why, Ethan?</i>

38:29.000 --> 38:32.415
<i>Because they learned that there can be
no lesson without consequence.</i>

38:32.416 --> 38:34.458
[women screaming]

38:35.791 --> 38:37.500
[Traveler] Somebody call a doctor!

38:41.333 --> 38:43.457
- [man] Call a paramedic!
- [Sarkowski] Get a doctor!

38:43.458 --> 38:44.582
Officer down.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.707
Back up! Everybody, back up!

38:46.708 --> 38:47.833
Back up!

38:55.625 --> 38:56.790
Hey, Nora.

38:56.791 --> 38:59.499
Did you hear about the officer
at the TSO checkpoint?

38:59.500 --> 39:00.874
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

39:00.875 --> 39:02.624
Lionel. Sweet man.

39:02.625 --> 39:03.957
I'm so sorry.

39:03.958 --> 39:07.332
I've been trying to get a hold of Ethan.
He was with the guy.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.875
- I don't know why he's not picking up.
- Go for it.

39:22.916 --> 39:25.250
[Traveler] He was a friend of yours,
wasn't he?

39:28.458 --> 39:29.540
It's a shame.

39:29.541 --> 39:32.500
Family man like that
having a heart attack.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.166
You killed him.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.457
I don't know about that.
I gave you some simple rules.

39:38.458 --> 39:40.958
You got cute. I'd say you killed him.

39:42.791 --> 39:44.666
You feel like killing someone else?

39:47.250 --> 39:48.250
Nora?

39:54.083 --> 39:54.916
I told you.

39:57.208 --> 40:00.290
I'm not some cartoon villain.
I'm just a regular guy like you

40:00.291 --> 40:04.290
except with goals
and a clear plan to achieve them.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.333
You, I see,

40:06.250 --> 40:07.999
like to improvise.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.415
"Active threat, not drugs, get Nora out,

40:12.416 --> 40:14.790
find smuggler near bar arcade."

40:14.791 --> 40:17.415
"Caucasian from New Jersey."

40:17.416 --> 40:19.625
That's good. How'd you get all that?

40:21.041 --> 40:24.916
You weren't worried about the dogs.
Whatever you're smuggling, it's not drugs.

40:25.916 --> 40:29.083
Bagel, pizza references
and you call Manhattan "the city".

40:29.416 --> 40:30.333
Hmm.

40:30.791 --> 40:34.625
Only people from New York
or Jersey call it that.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.582
Kept saying we're a lot alike.
I took a shot.

40:38.583 --> 40:42.499
Plus, I've played <i>Area 51</i>
every day for two years.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.416
I know that sound in my sleep.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.833
You said I wasn't your first choice.

40:47.416 --> 40:49.165
Supposed to be Jason, wasn't it?

40:49.166 --> 40:50.250
Yep.

40:51.625 --> 40:53.625
His twins are three.

40:56.625 --> 40:57.625
You would have...

41:00.291 --> 41:02.290
That would have been up to Jason.

41:02.291 --> 41:05.290
But if I had to, without hesitation.

41:05.291 --> 41:06.999
That's what you're dealing with.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.166
I want you to think about that,
and I want you to think about Nora.

41:11.416 --> 41:13.250
Then I want you to stop thinking.

41:18.458 --> 41:20.374
Now, this is the way the world works.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.083
There's people in control

41:22.791 --> 41:24.625
and there's people that listen.

41:26.041 --> 41:27.250
You listening?

41:29.958 --> 41:31.415
Ethan, are you listening?

41:31.416 --> 41:32.500
Yeah.

41:34.416 --> 41:36.749
In a few minutes,
a guy with a red baseball cap

41:36.750 --> 41:38.665
is gonna walk into your lane.

41:38.666 --> 41:40.208
What do you have to do?

41:41.958 --> 41:43.041
Nothing.

41:44.375 --> 41:45.375
That's right.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.875
Tell me there isn't something horrible
in that bag.

41:55.250 --> 41:56.250
No.

42:16.958 --> 42:18.041
[Jason] Lionel.

42:20.791 --> 42:23.125
It's messed up, man. You okay?

42:24.416 --> 42:25.415
Yeah.

42:25.416 --> 42:29.125
Nora called me, like, three times
trying to reach you. Call her back yet?

42:29.791 --> 42:33.458
I will, thanks.
And thanks for covering for me.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.416
I got it now.

42:39.750 --> 42:40.958
It's all right, man.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.707
Hey. Uh, you benching me?

42:45.708 --> 42:47.791
No, putting you back on metal detectors.

42:48.416 --> 42:50.374
Lionel's passing, this place is packed.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.957
Today is not the day to experiment.
I'll give you another shot.

42:52.958 --> 42:55.040
We'll talk about your future later.
But right now,

42:55.041 --> 42:57.333
Jason's back on the machine
and that's final.

42:58.500 --> 43:01.415
[Traveler] <i>If you're not on that machine
by the time our man gets there,</i>

43:01.416 --> 43:02.415
<i>you're in breach.</i>

43:02.416 --> 43:04.290
<i>Then maybe I don't start with Nora.</i>

43:04.291 --> 43:06.290
Yeah, I don't care what you do to me.

43:06.291 --> 43:07.791
<i>Who said anything about you?</i>

43:09.500 --> 43:11.665
<i>Your friend there
is coming off the machine.</i>

43:11.666 --> 43:14.041
<i>You can decide
if it happens your way or mine.</i>

43:15.333 --> 43:16.250
Look, I...

43:16.958 --> 43:20.208
My supervisor reassigned me.
What do you want me to do?

43:20.875 --> 43:22.958
<i>You're a smart kid, you'll figure it out.</i>

44:28.833 --> 44:30.540
<i>Whatever you're doing, do it fast.</i>

44:30.541 --> 44:32.000
Not helping.

44:38.125 --> 44:40.665
Hey, Ethan, I wanted to check on you.

44:40.666 --> 44:43.499
What happened to Lionel,
it's tragic, so sad.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.124
Yeah. I know.

44:45.125 --> 44:47.915
I thought we could start
a GoFundMe for his family.

44:47.916 --> 44:51.041
His wife and kids
I'm sure could use the help. Yeah?

44:51.708 --> 44:53.250
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

44:54.625 --> 44:58.124
You know, I think I heard
Samir talking about the same thing.

44:58.125 --> 45:00.332
- You should hit him up. Join forces.
- Yeah.

45:00.333 --> 45:01.500
Good idea.

45:15.916 --> 45:17.082
[Jason] What's up, man?

45:17.083 --> 45:20.249
I think I left my phone
down the side there.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.208
Do you see it? Down the bottom.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.749
- There's nothing there.
- No?

45:26.750 --> 45:29.166
Ah, I put it in the lost and found.

45:30.083 --> 45:32.916
- You okay?
- Sorry. Yeah, just a bit out of it today.

45:33.708 --> 45:35.916
[Traveler] <i>That's not bad. Allow me.</i>

46:00.083 --> 46:01.708
Step forward please, sir.

46:03.541 --> 46:06.041
All right, hold the line. Hold the line.

46:06.666 --> 46:09.083
- [machine buzzes]
- Raise your arms for me please.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.375
Man, really?

46:17.458 --> 46:19.083
Turn around for me please, sir.

46:20.791 --> 46:21.790
This isn't mine.

46:21.791 --> 46:24.041
- People's safety depends on you.
- I said it's not mine.

46:24.666 --> 46:26.957
I don't care what problems you have.
Don't bring 'em here.

46:26.958 --> 46:29.041
- It's not--
- Let's go. You're going home.

46:32.750 --> 46:34.125
Ethan, you're back on four.

46:35.458 --> 46:37.625
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it.

46:41.708 --> 46:43.415
[Traveler] <i>Hey, you did good.</i>

46:43.416 --> 46:44.333
Go to hell.

46:45.541 --> 46:47.041
I didn't say anything.

46:59.708 --> 47:01.333
You know, it's pretty weird.

47:02.250 --> 47:03.250
What?

47:03.916 --> 47:06.957
How your buddy, who's our
designated driver every bar night,

47:06.958 --> 47:09.333
gets himself fired
for drinking on the job.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.541
I thought I met assholes before...

47:14.500 --> 47:16.624
[Traveler] <i>Okay, Ethan,
it's time to save Nora's life.</i>

47:16.625 --> 47:19.540
<i>Red baseball cap,
three o'clock, by the bins.</i>

47:19.541 --> 47:20.625
<i>That's our guy.</i>

47:25.875 --> 47:27.541
[machine buzzes]

47:33.500 --> 47:35.500
[distorted voices on recording]

47:40.833 --> 47:42.041
[distorted] <i>Nov... chuck.</i>

48:51.708 --> 48:53.708
[beeping]

49:37.416 --> 49:38.916
Yeah. Get me Homeland.

49:50.875 --> 49:51.875
Hey!

49:54.041 --> 49:55.250
[Traveler] <i>Ethan.</i>

50:08.750 --> 50:09.958
Thank you.

50:11.791 --> 50:12.916
[Traveler] <i>Let him go.</i>

50:22.750 --> 50:23.833
<i>Proud of you.</i>

50:24.583 --> 50:25.666
[cell phone chimes]

50:28.083 --> 50:30.875
Asset says the locals
put out a call to Homeland.

50:31.708 --> 50:35.374
[Traveler] <i>That's fine. This is why
we have options. Where's the kid?</i>

50:35.375 --> 50:36.916
[retching]

50:39.166 --> 50:41.750
[woman on PA] <i>Last call for Flight 1237...</i>

50:44.458 --> 50:45.458
[door closes]

50:52.500 --> 50:54.875
There are 250 people on that flight.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.750
- You gonna kill 250 people?
- Mmm-hmm.

50:59.500 --> 51:01.707
I thought you said
you weren't a terrorist.

51:01.708 --> 51:06.208
I'm not. Terrorists kill for religious
or political or social objectives.

51:07.583 --> 51:09.415
Then why are you doing this?

51:09.416 --> 51:11.290
I'm not the doer either, Ethan.

51:11.291 --> 51:13.665
I'm just the one
that makes sure it gets done.

51:13.666 --> 51:14.790
[urinating]

51:14.791 --> 51:16.082
Then I get paid.

51:16.083 --> 51:19.332
We're trained to identify explosives.
I've never seen anything like that.

51:19.333 --> 51:22.415
Well, it's an A 234 nerve agent
called Novichok 7.

51:22.416 --> 51:26.499
Causes instant cholinergic crisis,
followed by massive internal bleeding.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.999
Russians love it.
Body breaks down, organ by organ,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.874
until eventually you drown
in your own blood.

51:32.875 --> 51:36.541
I'll take that phone, by the way.
Just put it right here on the counter.

51:42.458 --> 51:43.666
Thank you.

51:44.583 --> 51:46.083
There are kids on that flight.

51:47.291 --> 51:51.125
Yeah. The people paying me
want to send a message.

51:52.125 --> 51:54.249
One a busy world will have to hear.

51:54.250 --> 51:56.583
What message? Who's paying you?

52:00.750 --> 52:02.249
Ethan, the bigger the job is,

52:02.250 --> 52:04.957
the fewer people there are
that can do it, okay?

52:04.958 --> 52:08.124
And there are jobs happening all around

52:08.125 --> 52:11.790
that most people can't see
and they all have casualties.

52:11.791 --> 52:15.457
Fortunately, I'm the guy who can keep
those casualties to a minimum.

52:15.458 --> 52:17.374
250 people is a minimum?

52:17.375 --> 52:19.290
There are much larger numbers.

52:19.291 --> 52:22.124
Why make me an accomplice?
Why not just check the bag?

52:22.125 --> 52:25.332
Every checked bag is sorted through
automated CTX machines, you know that.

52:25.333 --> 52:27.040
Our best odds are with carry-on.

52:27.041 --> 52:30.166
We just needed a little fix
at the machine. Thank you.

52:31.208 --> 52:33.958
Okay. It's through the machine.
You got what you wanted.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.082
You can let us go.

52:36.083 --> 52:38.125
Soon as that plane takes off.

52:42.416 --> 52:43.583
[retching]

52:47.291 --> 52:52.332
Look, the hard part's already over.
A couple hours, you'll get your life back,

52:52.333 --> 52:54.332
Nora's gonna be safe. You do love her?

52:54.333 --> 52:56.415
Yeah, of course I love her.

52:56.416 --> 52:58.082
Yeah? A lot of people say that.

52:58.083 --> 53:00.582
I'm giving you
the opportunity to prove it.

53:00.583 --> 53:02.583
Here's some gum. You want any?

53:05.958 --> 53:09.582
Now, your shift's lunch break
is coming up. What are you gonna do?

53:09.583 --> 53:11.333
I usually eat with Nora.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.249
Great. I was hoping to get to know Nora.

53:14.250 --> 53:18.249
Chew that gum, take her out to lunch.
I'll be listening. You guys brown-bag it?

53:18.250 --> 53:21.749
No. Wait. I can't. I can't just sit
and act like everything's normal.

53:21.750 --> 53:23.040
- It won't work--
- Ethan.

53:23.041 --> 53:25.500
You break routine, you attract attention.

53:26.291 --> 53:27.291
Almost done.

53:28.666 --> 53:29.750
[door opens]

53:31.375 --> 53:32.458
[door closes]

53:40.041 --> 53:44.291
Agent John Alcott, DHS.
I'm looking for a Detective Cole.

53:44.916 --> 53:47.165
- Down the hall on the left.
- Happy holidays.

53:47.166 --> 53:49.415
[Conley] <i>You called Homeland
behind my back?</i>

53:49.416 --> 53:52.499
[Elena] We're dealing with a potential
live threat. I made a judgment call.

53:52.500 --> 53:57.124
Oh, by all means. Let's involve federal
agencies based on potential threats.

53:57.125 --> 53:59.582
Elena, it's Christmas Eve. Go home.

53:59.583 --> 54:02.332
Excuse me, since she already called,
I'm already here,

54:02.333 --> 54:04.082
and I don't want to make the drive twice.

54:04.083 --> 54:06.999
We take every threat seriously,
but your captain's right.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.790
We cannot declare martial law
over a soft lead.

54:09.791 --> 54:11.499
And how is this a soft lead?

54:11.500 --> 54:14.499
An old-school Bratva underboss

54:14.500 --> 54:18.665
maybe says the word Novichok
on a damaged ATF wiretap. I mean, come on.

54:18.666 --> 54:20.540
Has there been
any chatter about an attack?

54:20.541 --> 54:22.499
Always, but there's nothing credible.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.249
There's no talk
about chemical weapons in Los Angeles.

54:25.250 --> 54:29.249
Elena, you're reaching. Now, I'm going
home to enjoy dinner with my family.

54:29.250 --> 54:31.666
- I suggest you do the same.
- Cap!

54:34.541 --> 54:36.082
Hey, you know what?

54:36.083 --> 54:39.040
Let me call my guy
at the Office of Bioweapons Affairs,

54:39.041 --> 54:41.624
but I'm telling you,
he's gonna say the same thing.

54:41.625 --> 54:46.374
EMS had a 911 call placed at 10:04
this morning from inside LAX.

54:46.375 --> 54:50.499
Line is registered to a TSA officer,
guy named Ethan Kopek.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.625
Told you.

54:58.750 --> 55:02.041
[Nora] <i>I mean, Jason doesn't even
drink anymore. Like, ever.</i>

55:04.416 --> 55:05.874
Not since they had kids.

55:05.875 --> 55:08.457
Rochelle would have told me
if he needed help.

55:08.458 --> 55:10.250
Or I thought she would.

55:11.416 --> 55:13.250
Maybe Lionel dying just...

55:15.500 --> 55:17.875
- hit him hard.
- Oh. Mmm.

55:20.416 --> 55:22.875
You know, we should actually go to Tahiti.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.916
Never wait to celebrate, right?

55:27.708 --> 55:29.874
[Traveler] <i>Get more attentive, buddy.</i>

55:29.875 --> 55:32.083
You know, I wish we were there right now.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.750
So, tell me.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.416
What was your news?

55:39.166 --> 55:41.207
I... It doesn't matter.

55:41.208 --> 55:42.500
Of course it does.

55:43.458 --> 55:44.458
Tell me.

55:45.833 --> 55:48.250
[Traveler] <i>Normal, Ethan. Keep it normal.</i>

55:49.916 --> 55:52.625
So I went to speak to Sarkowski.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.750
About a promotion.

55:57.583 --> 55:59.708
And he's going to give me a trial run.

56:01.041 --> 56:04.583
Okay. And would that make you happy?

56:05.750 --> 56:09.458
Well, I just thought, you know,
we're going to need things.

56:10.666 --> 56:15.457
Doctors, car seats, cribs, clothes,
and, you know, those things cost money so...

56:15.458 --> 56:17.666
Well, we can figure out money.

56:19.833 --> 56:22.625
I only brought up the academy
because it was your dream.

56:23.625 --> 56:25.124
It was what you always wanted.

56:25.125 --> 56:27.624
Well, what if I don't know
what I want anymore?

56:27.625 --> 56:32.499
- [Traveler] <i>That is just sad.</i>
- Well, then we'll figure it out... together.

56:32.500 --> 56:33.415
Yeah.

56:33.416 --> 56:36.458
[Traveler] <i>Not the reaction
you were hoping for, huh, buddy?</i>

56:37.375 --> 56:39.208
I thought this was good news.

56:46.125 --> 56:49.250
What would you tell our kid
if they got knocked down?

56:50.375 --> 56:51.749
[Traveler] <i>Oh, that's good.</i>

56:51.750 --> 56:53.541
[Nora] You'd say, "Give it another shot."

56:55.458 --> 56:56.874
Don't be afraid to fail.

56:56.875 --> 56:59.290
[Traveler] <i>That's a smart woman.
You should listen to her.</i>

56:59.291 --> 57:01.208
<i>Tell her she's right. Go on.</i>

57:02.208 --> 57:04.040
<i>- Tell her.</i>
- Take a risk, Ethan.

57:04.041 --> 57:06.750
<i>- Tell her.</i>
- Stop telling me what to do.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.874
[Traveler] <i>Oopsie-daisy.
Hope you got her a good present.</i>

57:10.875 --> 57:13.915
Hey, I... Hey, I'm... I'm sorry.

57:13.916 --> 57:16.415
That was too much.
You're just trying to help me.

57:16.416 --> 57:20.250
Forget it. It's fine.
It's been a really hard day.

57:21.958 --> 57:23.207
Yeah.

57:23.208 --> 57:25.833
- We can just talk tonight, okay?
- Okay.

57:26.458 --> 57:31.625
I, um... I gotta get back,
but call me end of shift.

57:32.500 --> 57:34.665
<i>Oh, you're gonna need
a big couch to sleep on tonight.</i>

57:34.666 --> 57:36.374
- Shut up.
<i>- Well, I'm just saying.</i>

57:36.375 --> 57:37.791
[Nora] Hi, beautiful girl.

57:39.541 --> 57:41.958
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

57:44.333 --> 57:45.541
Nora?

57:49.208 --> 57:50.958
You're the best thing in my life.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.790
You too.

57:54.791 --> 57:56.500
<i>Hey, you're back in the bed.</i>

58:02.250 --> 58:04.040
No one ran this down?

58:04.041 --> 58:07.457
They did. Kopek's phone was off,
so they called LAXPD

58:07.458 --> 58:10.665
and an Officer Lionel Williams
gave the all clear.

58:10.666 --> 58:12.374
So it was logged as an error.

58:12.375 --> 58:15.665
Officer Williams died
less than two hours ago. Heart attack.

58:15.666 --> 58:19.124
- [Agent Alcott] You don't buy it?
- And you do? Too many things.

58:19.125 --> 58:23.041
- That's not a category of threat.
- What 30-year-old turns off his phone?

58:25.083 --> 58:26.415
I need to talk to Kopek.

58:26.416 --> 58:28.040
Okay, I'll go with you.

58:28.041 --> 58:29.499
Thought it was a soft lead.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.374
Spirit of Christmas.
Plus, I can call my guy on the way.

58:32.375 --> 58:34.499
Rush order a tox screen
on Officer Williams.

58:34.500 --> 58:37.457
Let's put an alert out,
conduct random passenger searches.

58:37.458 --> 58:40.290
Kopek works the Northwind terminal.
Let's start there.

58:40.291 --> 58:42.082
I'll get the ball rolling with airport PD.

58:42.083 --> 58:45.540
They could use a head start given the
shitstorm we're about to drop on them.

58:45.541 --> 58:48.541
You drive.
Texting and driving is how I kill people.

58:49.416 --> 58:52.874
You're ordering a random sweep
of Terminal 7, middle of Christmas Eve,

58:52.875 --> 58:56.458
the busiest travel day of the year,
and you're not gonna tell me why?

58:57.875 --> 59:00.874
No, it's great.
People love missing their flights.

59:00.875 --> 59:03.208
They come to the airport for the sushi.

59:06.416 --> 59:10.082
[woman on PA] <i>Attention. To ensure
the safety of those traveling today,</i>

59:10.083 --> 59:12.749
<i>the TSA will be performing
random bag checks.</i>

59:12.750 --> 59:15.499
<i>If you are selected,
please accompany the officer.</i>

59:15.500 --> 59:18.249
<i>Thank you for your cooperation,
and happy holidays.</i>

59:18.250 --> 59:21.124
- [Traveler] <i>What's happening?</i>
- How should I know?

59:21.125 --> 59:24.582
We got a situation. I'm gonna
need you to shut down all the lines.

59:24.583 --> 59:26.333
- All the lines?
- Yes. All of them.

59:27.708 --> 59:29.249
[buzzes]

59:29.250 --> 59:31.707
[passengers clamoring]

59:31.708 --> 59:35.499
All right, listen up.
All lines are officially on hold.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.541
<i>Everyone meet in the office. Right now.</i>

59:45.791 --> 59:46.958
Just one second.

59:53.875 --> 59:57.083
Except you, Samir.
You deal with that. Good luck.

01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:05.082
[all yelling]

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:07.707
Y'all heard the call.
We're doing random sweeps.

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:09.999
- How many?
- I got a list of 50 passengers.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.374
- Fifty?
- [Sarkowski] Yeah.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.375
When we're done,
I'll have it sent to your MDTs, okay?

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:19.999
Work with the LEOs, find these people,
and bring them in for inspection, okay?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.749
Gonna really slow things down.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:23.624
- [Sarkowski] No shit.
- I didn't see an alert.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:27.207
[Sarkowski] Didn't get an official alert.
I just got a heads-up from the LAPD.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:29.874
- So let's go over some protocols.
- [device chimes]

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:33.791
Lance, you and Samir are gonna be working
crowd control. Keep the lanes open.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.082
The rest of us, we divide and conquer.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:41.291
Okay, Ron? Need you to open up
the back rooms for inspection.

01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:44.041
[Traveler] <i>Do you have eyes on him?</i>

01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:47.083
No. The whole room is a blind spot.

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:50.499
[Sarkowski] Some of these passengers
won't be happy.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.499
They give you shit,
you send them to me.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.290
- Yep.
- [Eddie] This shit sounds serious.

01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:58.207
- Is it weird I'm excited?
- [Sarkowski] Guys, don't get excited.

01:00:58.208 --> 01:00:59.707
Just our buddies at the LAPD

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:01.749
- justifying their budget.
- [man] This sucks.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:03.540
[Sarkowski] Look, I know it sucks.

01:01:03.541 --> 01:01:06.249
We can either waste our time
saying how much it sucks

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.915
or we get out and do our job
and find these people.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.708
- So, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:13.666
[Sarkowski] Hey, uh, Ethan.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:18.290
I know it's been
a particularly stressful day for you,

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:19.832
what with Jason and Lionel,

01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:21.541
so appreciate you digging in.

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:25.625
I can see you want to be here.

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:30.375
[closet door closes]

01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:39.875
[sighs] I know what you did.

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.958
And I know why you did it.

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:46.333
Just didn't think
you'd be that kind of guy, bro.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.625
Good luck with your promotion.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.625
Jason, I can fix this.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.416
Don't ever talk to me again.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:04.708
[Traveler] <i>You alone?</i>

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:06.290
Yeah.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:07.875
<i>Good, get back to work.</i>

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.499
[woman on PA] <i>Attention. To ensure
the safety of those traveling today,</i>

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.499
<i>the TSA will be performing
random bag checks.</i>

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.790
<i>The following passengers
are to report to a TSA officer.</i>

01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:22.165
<i>Carrie Pierce. Cameron Figgs.
Mateo Flores. Alison Mallory.</i>

01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:24.875
<i>Ethan, what did you do?</i>

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:27.915
Nothing, I didn't move.

01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:30.374
Why'd they pull my guy?

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.041
It's a lottery system.

01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:36.416
Right in here.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:42.208
You're lying. I don't know
how you did this, but this is you.

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:49.375
Sit right back down.
You leave that post, you're in breach.

01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:51.749
There's nothing I can do.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:52.957
Hey.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:54.249
This is over.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:55.541
<i>Hey, Ethan--</i>

01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:08.791
He's on his way down. Change his mind.

01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:10.208
Copy that.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.166
Let's go for a ride.

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:38.875
Hey!

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:53.666
Hey!

01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:55.707
We gotta go.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:56.958
What? Why?

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.665
- Rochelle texted me.
- No...

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:11.374
- She said you got Jason fired.
- I can explain but we have to move.

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:12.833
- So it's true?
- I had to!

01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:14.833
I don't understand.

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.207
To get a promotion?

01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:20.916
Why would you do that?

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:29.165
[Traveler] <i>You speak one word,
and she dies.</i>

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.290
<i>You have three seconds to back away</i>

01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:33.790
<i>or a 30-caliber round
will travel 3,000 feet per second</i>

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:36.082
<i>and paint the wall with her brain. Three...</i>

01:04:36.083 --> 01:04:38.165
Ethan, I need you to talk to me.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:39.458
<i>Two...</i>

01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:42.083
This isn't you.

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:45.583
<i>Not one word.</i>

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:48.000
So you're just walking away?

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:03.041
[woman on PA]
<i>Departure gate for Flight 3678...</i>

01:05:05.291 --> 01:05:06.790
[door opens]

01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:09.500
I was patient with you
because I thought I liked you.

01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:12.666
Come here.

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:19.290
People tell you who they are
long before they open up their mouths.

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:22.957
You know what you told me?
That you're pathetic and you're asleep.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.040
You're someone that's
so afraid to make a mistake,

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:27.207
you're willing to let
the whole world pass you by.

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:29.458
- That's how I knew you were my guy.
- I lied.

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:32.207
What's that?

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:36.499
I lied on the polygraph.
That's why I didn't get into the academy.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.415
- Yeah? What'd you lie about?
- Well, I told him that...

01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.416
Speak up.

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:44.957
Come here.

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:47.540
You think you can take control? Huh?

01:05:47.541 --> 01:05:51.124
You haven't been in control since you were
on that shitty track team in high school.

01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:53.750
So proud of the way
you can run fast in circles?

01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:57.207
High school was as good
as your life would get,

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.125
so this will be a mercy kill.

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:04.832
Okay, okay, all right, all right.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:08.000
That's great.
Well, at least this is interesting.

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.249
What now?

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.874
First, you're gonna call your sniper

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:16.999
and when I confirm Nora's okay,
then I am walking you out to the police.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.250
What if I do none of that
'cause the odds of you pulling that--

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.708
Let's do it your way.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.375
- Okay. Slowly.
- Yep.

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:29.458
Then we're gonna do the phone.

01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:34.166
All right? Let's take care of it.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.000
Here we go.

01:06:45.541 --> 01:06:46.541
What's the code?

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.041
The code?

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:53.500
You got ten minutes
before everybody in this airport dies.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.415
- Shut it down.
- Payload will spread through all the ducts

01:06:56.416 --> 01:06:58.790
in all the terminals in this airport
with 100% lethality--

01:06:58.791 --> 01:07:00.207
I said shut it down!

01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:03.374
I can't from here, buddy, okay?

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:06.207
Even if I wanted to, and I do want to
since I'm in this building.

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.915
I'll have to put my hands on it.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:11.957
Okay, come on, you're not gonna
shoot me, Ethan. Think about it.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:15.124
What happens after that?
I can disarm it in a minute-thirty,

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:16.790
I know what I'm doing. Do you?

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:20.165
Or maybe your Explosives Disposal Unit
can get there in time? I doubt it.

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:23.749
Would you rather kill 250 people
on a plane or 5,000 in an airport?

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.874
On Christmas Eve
it's probably closer to 10,000.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.749
That's the thing with numbers.
They all get larger.

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.207
Okay, go.

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.624
No, you go. Go to the case

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:34.707
and I'll walk you through
how to turn off that timer, okay?

01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:37.165
But don't talk to anybody.
Open up that mouth, I close mine.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:39.999
- Why are you making me do it?
- 'Cause you're not in control, Ethan,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.707
and you never will be.
Clock's ticking. So, go.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:44.333
Take the gun. Maybe run.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.291
And the other side, same thing?

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:01.291
No, sorry. That's the...
I made a mistake on the first side.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.375
Three.

01:08:09.833 --> 01:08:11.041
[Traveler] <i>Is he alone?</i>

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:15.082
- Doesn't seem to be working.
- I think my boss is in there with him.

01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:17.125
That's fine.
Walk in and shoot the boss.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:19.915
- What?
<i>- Nothing fancy.</i>

01:08:19.916 --> 01:08:22.249
One in the head, two max.
It's a plastic gun.

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.249
Each shot generates heat.
If it melts, it'll explode in your hands.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.249
No, I can't do that.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.749
Really? You seemed ready
to kill me a minute ago.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.207
- I can knock him out.
<i>- No. We don't have time to experiment.</i>

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:35.457
They're gonna die along with everyone else
in this airport if the bomb explodes.

01:08:35.458 --> 01:08:36.540
You make the choice.

01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:38.958
And look, Nora finally stopped crying.

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:48.665
- Back away.
- What are you doing?

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:49.624
<i>Do it. Shoot him.</i>

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.999
- I said back away from the case, please.
- All right. Backing away.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.790
Don't know what this is about,
but I know you don't want to do this.

01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.957
<i>If you don't do this,
a lot of people are gonna die.</i>

01:08:57.958 --> 01:08:59.332
I have to.

01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:00.500
About to be a father.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:04.458
Do you want your kid
growing up with this in his life?

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:09.624
Put the gun down and we can talk.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.999
He's done enough talking.
You're wasting time.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.915
Shoot him now or everyone dies.

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.999
Please, don't make me do this.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.416
<i>- Shoot him.</i>
- Who are you talking to?

01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:20.416
God damn it, do it now!

01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:40.874
Okay, and you're sure?
Okay. All right. Thanks, Marty.

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.457
It's my partner.
He just pulled the FAA manifest.

01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.915
There's no high-value targets
leaving LAX today.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.582
That's fine.

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:50.749
We'll just talk to the Kopek guy.
He knows something.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.915
[panting] Oh, God.

01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:55.625
[Sarkowski gurgling]

01:09:57.541 --> 01:09:58.874
I need a first aid kit.

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.249
<i>No. Sounds like
your boss is past an ice pack.</i>

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.457
Just get to the package
or everyone dies with him.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:05.333
I didn't have a choice.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.875
No, no, no! Please don't kill Jesse!

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:18.082
I don't know who that is.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:21.750
My husband. He took him from my house
and he gave me that case.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.416
You're not with them?

01:10:27.916 --> 01:10:28.833
I'm like you.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.165
Give me the codes.

01:10:32.166 --> 01:10:36.375
Left 109, right 083.

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.624
- Oh, God.
- What is that?

01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:47.708
Be quiet. Lock the door.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:54.165
Okay, what do I do?

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:56.374
<i>Do you see the two switches
on either side?</i>

01:10:56.375 --> 01:11:00.208
<i>I want you to unlock those and then
lift it out of the case by the frame.</i>

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.040
Okay, done.

01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:11.582
<i>There are two holes next to the timer.</i>

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:15.040
<i>Use them to turn
the circular plate clockwise,</i>

01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:16.333
<i>then pull up.</i>

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:21.582
<i>Okay, now, disconnect the remote relay.</i>

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:24.040
The button under the circular plate,

01:11:24.041 --> 01:11:27.166
<i>press it once to put it in manual mode.</i>

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:31.915
Good, good.

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:34.125
<i>Breathe if you haven't.</i>

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.500
<i>And then pull up on the handles
on the side of the cage slowly.</i>

01:11:48.958 --> 01:11:51.040
There are two clusters.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:52.582
<i>Grab the one on the right.</i>

01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:53.749
<i>Pull it up slowly.</i>

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:56.833
<i>Once it's out,
you'll be able to see the reset button.</i>

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:02.125
[bangs on door]

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:04.583
[Ron] Hey! Why is this door locked?

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.875
Just a minute.

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:12.500
[Ron] Kopek? Why are you in there?

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.624
<i>There's a button that should be visible
between the brackets.</i>

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.250
<i>That'll reset the device.</i>

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:22.875
- I can't reach it.
- [Ron] Let me in.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.165
What are you doing?

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:30.707
- Put it down.
- I won't let Jesse die!

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:31.875
Open the door.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.875
Look at me. Look at me!

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:37.125
I can do it.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.165
Please. Trust me.

01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:41.083
- Kopek!
- [Traveler] <i>Thirty seconds.</i>

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:02.583
Kopek, open this door.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.415
I'm not playing around.
Open the goddamn door right now.

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:14.957
[cell phone ringing]

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.457
- Yeah.
- [Herschel] <i>You were right.</i>

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.582
My three favorite words. What about?

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:20.249
Officer Williams.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:23.915
The ME found a scratch on the back
of his hand with traces of aconite.

01:13:23.916 --> 01:13:26.540
A cardiotoxin
that causes ventricular arrhythmia.

01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:27.915
Heart attack was induced.

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:30.249
Homeland's in play now too, by the way.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:33.665
They finally decided to check
the FAA passenger manifest

01:13:33.666 --> 01:13:36.457
to see if any high-value targets
were flying through Los Angeles.

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.458
- Uh-huh.
<i>- How about four of them?</i>

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:43.125
The hell is wrong with you,
leaving me outside like that?

01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:48.375
I was just... finishing up a bag check.

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:50.958
The room's all yours.

01:13:53.541 --> 01:13:55.540
We have four Marines coming from Arifjan

01:13:55.541 --> 01:13:58.165
to testify before Congress
on that Aleppo incident.

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.790
- Did we get their flight info?
<i>- No. It's redacted.</i>

01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:03.165
<i>But Homeland is sending
someone over with the raw data.</i>

01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:05.666
Okay. Give me his name. I'll bring him.

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:08.583
<i>Agent John Alcott.</i>

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:12.708
Okay.

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:15.457
That's great. Do me a favor.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:19.957
Brief Conley. Tell him I'm en route to LAX
with Agent John Alcott right now.

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:22.374
But that doesn't make any sense.
What are you--

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.875
- [line disconnects]
- Elena?

01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:28.832
You carried out a search
without a lead or a LEO present?

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:30.915
[Ethan] Sarkowski got called away
to ticketing.

01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:33.250
Just trying to, you know,
speed things along.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.458
Something's going on with you.

01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:43.250
And I'm gonna figure out what it is.

01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:50.208
[sighing in relief]

01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:53.583
I'm Ethan.

01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:56.290
- Mateo.
- [Traveler] <i>No, no.</i>

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:59.457
Get acquainted later. You need to
dispose of that body and get moving.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:00.957
Boarding time is in a half an hour.

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:03.000
- Everything all good?
- Yeah.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:07.040
You know, the world
trying to make you feel like shit

01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:10.415
because you go a whole five minutes
without checking your email

01:15:10.416 --> 01:15:12.625
to enjoy a conversation.

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:17.375
- Who are you?
- Whoa.

01:15:18.166 --> 01:15:20.582
Whoa, whoa.
John Alcott, okay? Homeland Security.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.832
- I'm the guy who just backed your play.
- Mmm-mmm.

01:15:22.833 --> 01:15:24.499
I offered to drive.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.583
Agent John Alcott is on his way
to the station right now.

01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:33.083
You intercepted my call to DHS.

01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:36.707
Yeah, we've had a network
around your station for the last 72 hours.

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:40.000
Who's "we"?
And what do you want with the Novichok?

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:45.790
So what are you gonna do?

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.500
You're gonna shoot me
doing 70 down the highway?

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:53.207
- [tires screech]
- [horns honking]

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:55.082
["Last Christmas" by Wham! playing]

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.500

- [gunshot]
- [gasps loudly]

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:07.541
We'll take him to sorting.
It's automated, no one will be there.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.416
How'd you get involved?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.333
I asked for a raise.

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.583
- [cell phone ringing]
- [panting]

01:17:19.291 --> 01:17:20.957
- Herschel... No.
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:24.249
No, not all right. Ping my phone.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.957
Send somebody to ID the body.

01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:27.000
<i>- A body?</i>
- Yeah.

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:30.165
Alcott... wasn't Alcott.

01:17:30.166 --> 01:17:33.915
<i>What the hell does that mean?
Elena? Elena?</i>

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.208
Police.

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.665
- Oh, my God!
- Police.

01:17:37.666 --> 01:17:40.165
- Are you okay? Okay.
- I'm police, I need the car.

01:17:40.166 --> 01:17:42.083
I'm not playing, I need the car.

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:47.915
My man Ethan.
They spring you for Christmas?

01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:51.082
No, not yet.
I gotta run this to sorting first.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.915
I can take it. Let's get you home.

01:17:52.916 --> 01:17:54.499
No, it's okay. I got it.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.415
It's no problem. I could take this--

01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:57.708
I said I got it.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.125
Merry Christmas.

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:06.874
<i>Sorry, I'm eating.</i>

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:10.374
Mateo, I'm speaking just to you now.
Cough if you understand.

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:11.665

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:15.125
Okay. I want you to listen,
but do not speak. Hold on.

<i>Okay, put him through.</i>

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.915
Mateo, it's me.

01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:27.166

01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:12.250

Where's the security director?

01:23:39.166 --> 01:23:42.082
Sarkowski? I think he's in ticketing.
Can I help you?

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:45.833
I need a line to LAX Security Tower
and I need to talk to Ethan Kopek.

Do you have eyes on Kopek?

What is he doing down there?
The guy's been acting wiggly all day.

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:03.499
Shut this checkpoint down now

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.790
and put Tower on notice
for all Northwind flights.

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.040
You take me down there?

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.332

Terminal 7. We have an active threat.

Shut down 7 and all of Northwind.

let me go, I have to get to my girlfriend.

No. You are coming with me

the nerve gas. Now, where is it?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.040
He still has it. Listen. Listen!

He's trying to take out Northwind 1850.
All passengers.

01:29:32.458 --> 01:29:34.540
- I don't know if there's a target--
- You been shot?

01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:37.040
I've been trying to stop them.
They threatened my girlfriend.

01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:39.458
- There's someone after her.
- You're coming with me.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.332
I'm sorry. He's getting on Northwind 1850.

01:29:44.333 --> 01:29:48.665
White male. American. Fifties. Black hat,
black case with a red ribbon on it.

01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:51.582
He's got ground support
and he's tapped into the cameras.

- I'm sorry.
- Where's Nora?

01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.250
I saw her go downstairs.

01:30:23.083 --> 01:30:24.291
Get out of the way!

01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:48.833
Help!

01:30:57.833 --> 01:30:59.416
[silenced gunshot]

01:31:12.916 --> 01:31:13.832
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:14.875
They hurt you?

01:31:29.375 --> 01:31:30.625
You're Jesse?

01:31:32.458 --> 01:31:35.333
My husband, Mateo Flores, is he...

01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:44.375
He did everything he could to save you.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:46.916
They said everything would be fine.

01:31:47.416 --> 01:31:50.499
If he did what they wanted, they'd let him
fly back from DC tomorrow.

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.583
DC?

01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:55.249
He's not supposed to be
on the New York flight?

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.166
They gave him two tickets.

01:32:02.666 --> 01:32:06.249
[man on TV] <i>Turner doesn't have the votes

[Grace] <i>To ensure global stability

01:32:18.291 --> 01:32:20.249
Look who's on TV.

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.207
[Traveler] Well,
she's everywhere these days.

01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:24.457
<i>...to defend threatened democracies

01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:25.374
Yeah.

<i>...and keeps conflict from our borders.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.249
LAXPD is aware

01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:47.040
Everything coming into Terminal 7
is rerouted to Burbank or Long Beach.

01:32:47.041 --> 01:32:49.957
But I have 60,000 passengers
in the rest of this airport.

01:32:49.958 --> 01:32:51.540
<i>And I gotta keep them moving.</i>

01:32:51.541 --> 01:32:54.582
Send me everything you got.
I'll let you know what we find.

01:32:54.583 --> 01:32:55.790
[cell phone ringing]

01:32:55.791 --> 01:32:56.707
Herschel?

01:32:56.708 --> 01:32:59.290
Perfect timing. This just got super weird.

01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:00.999
You can't surprise me today.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.082
<i>I'll try.</i>

01:33:02.083 --> 01:33:04.290
Fake Alcott is former Intelligence.

01:33:04.291 --> 01:33:06.207
Any relationship with the Russians?

01:33:06.208 --> 01:33:10.540
Not that I can find. He was discharged
under some heavily redacted circumstances,

01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:13.332
then went freelance
for defense contractors.

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:16.249
Highest bidder types. They bid high.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:20.124
Kopek said these guys are spread wide
and tapped in. Even painted a suspect.

01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:21.832
Kopek? The guy who called us?

01:33:21.833 --> 01:33:24.540
<i>- You trust him?</i>
- Keep looking for possible targets.

01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:26.957
Start with Flight 1850,
and then widen the net.

01:33:26.958 --> 01:33:29.249
Everybody with a flight today,
anybody with a profile.

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.374
Yeah, on it.

White male, fifties, black hat,

01:33:38.875 --> 01:33:41.333
Find him and do not let him board.

01:33:43.125 --> 01:33:45.666
[Grace] Oh, sweetie. Are you ready to fly?

01:33:46.375 --> 01:33:48.833
[flight attendant] Hello! He's so cute.

01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:51.957
- How old is he?
- Eleven months old today.

01:33:51.958 --> 01:33:54.625
- Have a safe flight, Congresswoman. Bye.
- Thank you.

01:33:59.958 --> 01:34:01.958
[sirens wailing]

01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:06.457
I got an album coming out in two days.
You know what I'm saying?

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:09.833
It's on SoundCloud. [groans] Patreon.

01:34:10.458 --> 01:34:12.041
[Ethan] We gotta find this bag.

01:34:12.541 --> 01:34:13.625
[Nora] I got this.

01:34:17.416 --> 01:34:19.375
Nora Parisi, Airport Operations.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:30.708
[woman] What's your seat number?

01:34:36.208 --> 01:34:38.750
If the bag is scanned,
then I can find it anywhere.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:41.375
Sorry.

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:45.790
Sir, I'm afraid that's too big to fit
as a carry-on. I can check it for you.

01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:49.375
- No, I promise you I measured it myself.
- See, it's already been flagged.

01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:55.540
I'll take it to cargo myself.
It'll be there when we land.

01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:58.833
I promise. Would you like
to take anything out of it now?

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:01.833
No.

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.165
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:10.500
Ready? Five, five, two, six, eight,
four, four, zero, three, five.

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:27.165
I got it. It's on Trans Global 0610
to Washington, DC.

01:35:27.166 --> 01:35:29.707
They boarded.
I'll call Tower and stop the flight.

01:35:29.708 --> 01:35:33.540
No. Wait, wait. If we stop the flight,
he'll just trigger it on the ground.

01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:35.000
It'll kill everyone anyway.

01:35:35.666 --> 01:35:38.708
I diffused it once. I can do it again.

01:35:41.666 --> 01:35:43.125
I know what to do.

01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:46.124
There's an LAPD detective
trying to stop the bomb.

01:35:46.125 --> 01:35:49.000
Find her, tell her
she has to let that plane take off.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.458
[cell phone ringing]

01:35:58.333 --> 01:35:59.415
- Hey.
- [Herschel] <i>Hey.</i>

01:35:59.416 --> 01:36:01.915
That Aleppo case, it was a dead end.

01:36:01.916 --> 01:36:05.249
Marines say the confession scrapped
the need to testify. Anything?

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:08.290
Maybe. Found someone traveling
with a small security detail,

01:36:08.291 --> 01:36:09.790
but in a different terminal.

01:36:09.791 --> 01:36:12.791
Name is Grace Suarez.

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:14.999
Wait. Hang on. That's Grace Turner.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.415
<i>The Congresswoman.</i>

01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:18.499
Her office has her flying under
her maiden name.

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.874
<i>That's why she wasn't flagged.</i>

01:36:19.875 --> 01:36:22.124
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain.</i>

01:36:22.125 --> 01:36:25.790
<i>Merry Christmas and welcome aboard
Trans Global Air Flight 0610</i>

01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:28.207
<i>with nonstop service to Washington, DC.</i>

01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:30.707
She has been the face of DTD,

01:36:30.708 --> 01:36:34.124
a huge spend for threatened democracies
around the globe.

01:36:34.125 --> 01:36:38.083
Weapons manufacturers are all over this
thing, but she doesn't have the votes.

01:36:38.833 --> 01:36:40.540
Think the Russians want to take her out?

01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:42.540
Kopek said these guys are American.

01:36:42.541 --> 01:36:45.291
Fake Alcott, a hired gun
for defense contractors.

01:36:46.208 --> 01:36:49.207
It's a set-up. Plane full of people,

01:36:49.208 --> 01:36:53.207
Congresswoman, all killed
by Russian nerve toxin on Christmas Eve.

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:56.207
Everyone blames the Russians for killing
the one who stood up to them.

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:59.707
<i>Congress would rally around her bill,
open up a firehose of funding.</i>

01:36:59.708 --> 01:37:01.832
Private contractors
get more than they ever dreamed.

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:05.290
All they had to do was kill one of their
own and everybody on board with her.

01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:08.374
- What flight is she on?
<i>- Trans Global 610.</i>

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:10.583
Tower needs to ground that plane now.

01:37:48.083 --> 01:37:49.749
Where's Trans Global 610 now?

01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:53.165
Taxiing to the runway,
preparing for departure.

01:37:53.166 --> 01:37:55.415
You need to stall it.
Keep it on the ground.

01:37:55.416 --> 01:37:56.499
Is this your guy?

01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:00.249
It's a delicate situation. We can't do
anything to spook anybody on board.

01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:02.290
Tell them it's a mechanical issue,
a delay.

01:38:02.291 --> 01:38:03.790
Why? What am I dealing with?

01:38:03.791 --> 01:38:05.208
[Nora] Are you with LAPD?

01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:06.916
You can't ground 610.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.624
And who are you?

01:38:08.625 --> 01:38:10.624
Nora Parisi, Northwind Operations.

01:38:10.625 --> 01:38:13.540
You just tried to arrest
my boyfriend Ethan Kopek.

01:38:13.541 --> 01:38:15.040
You can't ground that plane.

01:38:15.041 --> 01:38:17.124
[Marm] <i>Detective, we have 610 on the line.</i>

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:18.832
Yeah. Tell them to hold on.

01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:22.082
[woman on radio] <i>Trans Global 610,
you are not yet cleared for takeoff.</i>

01:38:22.083 --> 01:38:24.374
<i>Please stand by for further instructions.</i>

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.874
I know what's on it.
Tell your boyfriend to stay out of it.

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:29.124
We've got a trained killer
on board with a bomb.

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:31.499
And the moment he sees
anyone coming, he will set it off.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.833
Ethan can disarm it without him knowing.
It's the only way.

01:38:39.541 --> 01:38:42.207
So you expect me
to risk a plane full of people

01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:46.124
because your boyfriend who decked me
says he can defuse a bomb mid-flight?

01:38:46.125 --> 01:38:48.125
He did it before, he can do it again.

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:52.166
Detective, we have 610 holding.
What am I doing here?

01:39:00.791 --> 01:39:02.208
It's the only way.

01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:07.166
LA Tower,
what's the reason for the holdup?

01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:12.874
[woman] <i>Trans Global 0610,
we have a Code 4 on the ground.</i>

01:39:12.875 --> 01:39:14.625
<i>We're trying to assess with local PD.</i>

01:39:15.208 --> 01:39:16.208
[Marm] <i>Detective?</i>

01:39:17.333 --> 01:39:18.208
Tower...

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.249
Allow 0610 to take off.

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.208
You sure?

01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:25.958
You heard me.

01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.832
Good news, folks.
We've received the all clear.

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:35.333
<i>Flight attendants,

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.500
[Traveler] Ethan!

01:42:06.166 --> 01:42:08.415
This stopped being funny
the last time I shot you.

01:42:08.416 --> 01:42:11.707
Nice touch switching out the bags.
Put that down and step away from it.

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:14.166
I'm dead anyway
if I let you set this thing off.

01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:16.250
Might as well shoot me again.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Okay.

01:42:20.708 --> 01:42:22.375
Movement in cargo hold, checking.

01:42:29.458 --> 01:42:31.457
It's over, pal.
It was over the minute I met you.

01:42:31.458 --> 01:42:33.457
You don't know shit about me.

01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:36.540
LA Tower, we have
two armed individuals aboard the aircraft.

01:42:36.541 --> 01:42:37.833
We're declaring an emergency.

01:42:39.375 --> 01:42:41.874
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.</i>

01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:44.040
<i>For your safety, we are returning to LAX.</i>

01:42:44.041 --> 01:42:46.415
<i>Flight attendants,
please prepare for landing.</i>

01:42:46.416 --> 01:42:48.332
Talk all you want while you can.

01:42:48.333 --> 01:42:51.207
You're about to die
with everyone else on this plane.

01:42:51.208 --> 01:42:53.290
I don't even have to shoot you again.

01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:54.875
All I have to do...

01:42:58.958 --> 01:43:00.166
is nothing.

01:43:12.291 --> 01:43:13.750
You think bombs spoil?

01:43:14.666 --> 01:43:15.708
Nice work.

01:43:18.291 --> 01:43:20.540
Still wanna know
why I flunked that polygraph?

01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:25.750
No, thanks. I'm gonna be busy
setting up my parachute and my bomb.

01:43:27.208 --> 01:43:30.207
They asked if I ever saw a crime
that you didn't report.

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:31.999
Let me guess. Your dad, right?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.082
Yeah.

01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:36.874
Lifted a few bucks from the till?
You lied for sad old Dad, huh?

01:43:36.875 --> 01:43:39.082
I was just trying to protect him.

01:43:39.083 --> 01:43:41.040
I never was much of a liar.

01:43:41.041 --> 01:43:43.999
Yeah? Well, you protected him
and then they threw you out

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.375
and you've been like him
ever since, right?

01:43:47.375 --> 01:43:50.791
A loser, a waste, and asleep.

01:43:58.833 --> 01:44:00.375
I guess I woke up.

01:44:05.291 --> 01:44:06.540

01:45:44.583 --> 01:45:46.790
- Set up a perimeter.

- Set up triage over there!
<i>- Intercept in 30 seconds.</i>

01:45:53.208 --> 01:45:55.082
Vacuum-sealed in a fridge.

01:45:55.083 --> 01:45:56.457
And the guy?

01:45:56.458 --> 01:45:57.375
Same fridge.

01:45:59.416 --> 01:46:01.165
We've got a dispersed nerve agent.

01:46:01.166 --> 01:46:04.124
Send in Hazmat,
get all these passengers out of here now.

01:46:04.125 --> 01:46:06.333
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get him to a medic.

01:46:11.416 --> 01:46:12.624
- No, ma'am.
- Ethan!

01:46:12.625 --> 01:46:14.999
- No, we can't have you go in right now.
- Hey.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.416
- Nobody's going any further.
- Let her through.

01:46:22.666 --> 01:46:24.207
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:25.624
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:27.625
[Elena] Set up a perimeter over there.

01:46:28.708 --> 01:46:30.333
I knew you could do it.

01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:33.625
[Elena] Hazmat.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.958
Watch your steps coming down, folks.

01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.583
I love you.

01:46:45.250 --> 01:46:46.458
I love you.

01:46:57.833 --> 01:46:59.249
Yeah, I'm sorry I hit you.

01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:01.916
Mmm-hmm. You got good instincts, Kopek.

01:47:03.833 --> 01:47:05.875
Call me when you get that stitched up.

01:47:42.250 --> 01:47:44.416
- Yeah.
- [machine buzzes]

01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:56.207
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.707
Tahiti today?

01:47:57.708 --> 01:47:59.000
About time.

01:47:59.833 --> 01:48:02.665
Ooh, so cute. But maybe we can do this
on the other side.

01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:05.165
- Yes, sir.
- This line is ridiculous.

01:48:05.166 --> 01:48:07.832
How long does it take you
to wave a wand over an old lady?

01:48:07.833 --> 01:48:09.041
Hey!

01:48:09.625 --> 01:48:11.208
She's just doing her job.

01:48:13.125 --> 01:48:14.208
Happy Christmas.

01:48:18.916 --> 01:48:20.375
All right. Let's go.

01:48:20.833 --> 01:48:23.666
[Jason] Yo, left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot...

01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:25.791
Oh...
