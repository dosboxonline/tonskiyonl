- Thank you so much!
- You're welcome.

My first autograph.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.650
Mine too.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.986
Something tells me it won't be your last.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.323
Hi. I'm Julia with Icon Branding.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.826
We represent a select group of athletes

13:10.873 --> 13:11.831
Is this a job offer?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.541
A career offer.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.419
And a very cool one at that.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.004
We travel you to tournaments

13:18.005 --> 13:21.341
put on demonstrations,
take photos, post on social.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.384
That sort of thing.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.346
That's just the base salary.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.931
Tory, th-that's...

13:27.515 --> 13:28.431
Life-changing.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.268
You don't have to give me an answer now.
Show that to your lawyer.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.229
Both of you.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.232
Are you serious?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.901
Absolutely. We saw what you did out there.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.487
- [chuckles]
- [Julia] Injuries heal.

[Robby laughing] Oh my God!

13:51.872 --> 13:52.790
[music fades]

13:53.833 --> 13:55.834
The red mats do look good.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.963
- Look.
- [gasps] Hey.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.339
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.758
I think it was your right foot.
Almost cracked my jaw.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.803
I'm sorry about that.
But after what happened in Barcelona,

14:06.804 --> 14:11.559
I wanted to make sure that the tournament
resumed without any issues.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.395
But I'd like to make it up to you.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.022
[exciting music plays]

14:18.023 --> 14:19.400

[Demetri] Whoa! Ooh!

14:33.205 --> 14:34.290
Is this seat taken?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.249
It... Yeah.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.542
Yeah. Uh, no! No! I...

14:37.543 --> 14:39.503
It's... It's not taken at all.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.089
Unless you're saying
you'd like to reclaim it.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.385
Yes, Demetri. Since my hand was on it,
that is what I'm saying.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.637
Right. Yes.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.683
So my apology's accepted?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.311
Yes, all billions of them.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.187
The flowers and the candy
were appreciated too.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.148
You definitely got
a little full of yourself.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.066
Mm-hmm.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.611
But I've been there, so I get it.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.864
You did the crime.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.074
You've done your time.

15:10.075 --> 15:10.993

- You hear that sound?

That's the sound of your hometown crowd.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.864
Everyone you know

15:49.615 --> 15:51.325
is here to watch this match.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.788
Hey, if you think you came here
to psych me out before the fight,

15:56.288 --> 15:57.622
you got another thing coming.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.540
[scoffs]

15:59.208 --> 16:00.793
I'm not here to psych you out.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.003
This is going to be easy.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.217
I'm not gonna make it easy.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.014
You know, I do admire your confidence,

16:14.765 --> 16:18.060

of a humiliating defeat.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.657
Well, that's half true.

After this fight,
your family will be there for you.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.621
To console you.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.290
To tell you
everything's gonna be all right.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.459
To hold your hand

16:43.002 --> 16:45.546
when you are carried out of here
on a stretcher.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.508
But what they don't know

16:50.759 --> 16:53.344
is how it actually feels

16:53.345 --> 16:56.140
to lose a fight of this magnitude.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.600
But you do.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.478
'Cause you've been there.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.231
You know what it's like on the other side.

17:05.149 --> 17:08.068
And you know it's going to haunt you
for the rest of your life.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.196
And with the cameras
and the coverage that this fight brings,

17:12.197 --> 17:13.741
your family and friends,

17:14.658 --> 17:16.034
well, they'll never forget.

She might not be aware now,

17:24.418 --> 17:27.337
but the kids at school
will call her a loser.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.507
Just like her father.

You think Lawrence stands a shot
against this guy?

18:24.394 --> 18:26.605
Nah. He's fucked. [chuckles]

18:27.856 --> 18:28.982
You're probably right.

And this time,

18:36.782 --> 18:40.326
we're playing by the traditional rules
you know from the All Valley,

18:40.327 --> 18:42.203
where three points wins.

18:42.204 --> 18:46.375
First, we have the defending champions,
hailing from Hong Kong,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.835
led by their sensei,

18:48.836 --> 18:52.421
the youngest fighter
to ever win the Sekai Taikai.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.550
He's undefeated in seven karate circuits.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.594
He was born Feng Xiao,

18:58.428 --> 19:00.681
but you might know him better
by another name.

Afraid.

[Vidal] Ready?

22:38.648 --> 22:40.192
[tense music continues]

22:43.028 --> 22:44.403

Hey.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.380
No point. Illegal contact
to the back of the head.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.980
Oh, come on. That's bullshit.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.524
That's gotta be illegal, right?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.776
No point. Direct elbow to the mouth.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.362
[tense music continues]

23:27.864 --> 23:29.949
Next time, it's gonna be
a one-point deduction.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.160
Well, I'll be more careful
next time, then.

23:33.078 --> 23:33.954
I promise.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.541
Time.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.459

Oi. You must control the fight.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.469
Use angles to counter his attack.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.471
I'm trying.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.558
He's too fast. He's too strong.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.436
Since when have you cared about that?
Let go of the pressure.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.773
I told you. It doesn't matter if you win.
You just do your best.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.525
Yeah, yeah.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.545
[Vidal] Point.

24:24.546 --> 24:28.633
[in Spanish] Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.011
[in English] Wolf, 2-0.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.137
[Daryl] One more point,

24:33.138 --> 24:36.725
and the Iron Dragons
will be crowned Sekai Taikai champions.

[man] Come on, Johnny. Get up, man.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.231
[Daniel] He's way off balance.
I'm not sure Miyagi-Do is gonna help.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.733
Then try something else.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.444

39:17.480 --> 39:20.065
is gonna be teaching
a weekend class for beginners.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.108
So start stretching, little man.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.736
Hey. Hey, Baby Red. Eyes up here.

39:24.737 --> 39:25.779
[rock music plays]

39:25.780 --> 39:28.531
I know right now
you are the portrait of dejection,

39:28.532 --> 39:30.076
but let me tell you something.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.286
It's not gonna fly here at Cobra Kai.
You gotta be tough.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.413
You gotta be able to persevere.

39:35.414 --> 39:38.500
You have to be able
to look into the eyes of a dragon,

39:38.501 --> 39:40.502
and with no weapon in hand,

39:40.503 --> 39:43.421
with only your heart and your own will,
you have to--

39:43.422 --> 39:46.008
[cell phone rings]

39:47.134 --> 39:49.177
- Hey, Mom.
- [boy] Come on!

39:49.178 --> 39:51.597
It is a bad time. I'm in the middle of--

39:53.849 --> 39:56.601
Okay. Well, I'll get the dry cleaning
on the way home.

39:56.602 --> 40:00.438
Can this wait a couple of hours? I'm--
Okay, fine. Stop yelling. I'm going.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.440
[rock music continues]

40:02.441 --> 40:03.359
[groans]

40:03.859 --> 40:05.319
Mothers are not the enemy.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.156
All right. Uh, I gotta go.
Official dojo business.

40:10.157 --> 40:13.160
While you're waiting,
think about your life choices.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.789
And do a hundred jumping jacks.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.249
Wow.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.001
They're listening to me.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.170
[music stops]

40:37.810 --> 40:39.603
I know for most of you,
this is your first day.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.607
Honestly, it's been a while
since I taught here too.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.027
The last time I was here,

40:47.987 --> 40:50.531
I was trying to come to terms
with the words on this wall.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.077
I learned firsthand,

40:56.078 --> 40:57.955
if you live your whole life this way,

40:58.831 --> 41:00.249
you'll turn into an asshole.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.043
So I rejected it.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.590
But what I found out later

41:08.299 --> 41:09.633
is there is no one way.

41:11.218 --> 41:13.720
If you wanna conquer life's obstacles
and be the best you can be,

41:13.721 --> 41:15.723
you need to learn
more than one discipline.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.850
<i>That's why, in addition to Cobra Kai...</i>

41:18.851 --> 41:21.060
That's it. Side. Side.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.063
[Johnny] <i>...you're all gonna
learn Miyagi-Do.</i>

41:23.564 --> 41:26.149
<i>- You're gonna be taught defense.</i>
- Left circle.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.901
- [Johnny] <i>And inner strength.</i>
- Right circle.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.236
[Johnny] <i>From one of the best senseis
in the world.</i>

41:30.237 --> 41:32.323
<i>Because aggression
isn't always the answer.</i>

41:33.199 --> 41:37.536
<i>Sometimes, patience and defense
are the keys to winning.</i>

41:41.540 --> 41:42.917
But I can't teach you that.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.753
'Cause my specialty is offense.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.630
[rock music plays]

41:48.631 --> 41:49.632
"Strike first."

41:51.175 --> 41:52.468
It means be aggressive.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.971
"Strike hard." It means give it your all.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.599
"No mercy."

41:59.558 --> 42:01.351
It means not being Mr. Nice Guy.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.019
[rock music continues]

42:03.020 --> 42:04.855
It's the hardest one to understand.

42:05.606 --> 42:09.068
But the fact is, if you're too nice,
the world's gonna walk all over you.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.365
A lot of you have been told
your whole life that you're special.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.033
Well, that's about to change.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.327
[rock music continues]

42:20.788 --> 42:22.622
I'm talking to you, four-eyes. Good God.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.208
Take those glasses off.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.669
Get a cooler pair or get some contacts,

42:27.670 --> 42:30.213
but I never want to see those
in this dojo again. Understand?

42:30.214 --> 42:31.130
Yes.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.424
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Sensei!

42:33.425 --> 42:35.802
[rock music continues]

42:35.803 --> 42:37.763
We do not train to be merciful here.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.809
But I will bring out the best in you.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.896
Miguel Diaz may be a world champion,

42:46.939 --> 42:49.817
but when he first stepped foot
in this dojo, he was a total dork.

42:51.443 --> 42:52.945
He was like this kid right here.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.448
All right, maybe not as bad,
but the fact is,

42:57.366 --> 43:01.703
Cobra Kai turned Miguel
from a beta duckling into an alpha swan.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.998
So it doesn't matter
how much of a loser you are right now.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.084
Give it time,
and I'll make a champion out of you.

43:07.751 --> 43:11.087
All that matters
is you stop being weak little crybabies

43:11.088 --> 43:14.007
and start being
the strongest versions of yourselves.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.092
- Can you do that?
- [all] Yes, Sensei.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.177
- What was that?
- [all] Yes, Sensei!

43:18.178 --> 43:19.721
I can't hear you!

43:19.722 --> 43:21.556
[all] Yes, Sensei!

43:21.557 --> 43:23.642
[rock music continues]

43:26.395 --> 43:27.354
[music stops]

43:33.193 --> 43:34.444
[man 1] All right, lay it on me.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.655
So the show would be set in Hill Valley,
alternate 1985.

43:37.656 --> 43:40.367
We need Wilson, Thompson, and Zane,
and we got the green light.

43:40.868 --> 43:41.826
Billy's a friend.

43:41.827 --> 43:44.287
Did an art piece for my foyer.
It's an easy call to make.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.664
I feel like why not get Crispin too?
Maybe Mike to direct?

43:46.665 --> 43:48.916
- We can blow this up.
- [man 2] This is gonna be amazing.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.753
- [waitress] Here you are.
- Gracias.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.547
[upbeat music plays in background]

43:54.256 --> 43:56.174
Kids are chomping at the bit
for the All Valley.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.218
Yeah, it'll be here before you know it.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.303
That... That reminds me.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.847
I was thinking that

44:02.973 --> 44:06.100
maybe it'll be good for Anthony
to enter as Cobra Kai, you know?

44:06.101 --> 44:08.853
It'll be probably good for him
to have a neutral sensei.

44:08.854 --> 44:12.733
Hell yeah. Works for me.
The kid's really coming into his own.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.568
And I was thinking
that Devon could fight for Miyagi-Do.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.321
She could use a little more defense.

44:17.905 --> 44:18.946
[Daniel] You got it.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.616
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you.

44:22.284 --> 44:23.619
Ever get one of these in the mail?

44:25.871 --> 44:27.163
Yeah. It's a property tax bill.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.123
Didn't I already pay taxes when I bought?

44:29.124 --> 44:31.459
Yeah, you did, and you're gonna have
to pay that bill too.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.502
Are you serious?

44:32.503 --> 44:35.756
Yeah. It's no different than your
business tax that you pay for the dojo.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.176
I'm gonna introduce you to my accountant.

44:40.177 --> 44:43.472
- What, is he gonna send me a bill too?
- Yeah.

44:44.765 --> 44:48.102
I'm gonna go drain the main vein.
Don't order without me.

44:51.105 --> 44:54.274
[fly buzzes]

44:57.277 --> 44:59.279
[poignant music plays]

45:03.450 --> 45:05.243
Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

45:05.244 --> 45:07.704
Man who catch fly with chopstick...

45:07.705 --> 45:08.621
[fly buzzes]

45:08.622 --> 45:10.289
...accomplish anything.

45:10.290 --> 45:12.334
[poignant music continues]

45:16.380 --> 45:18.382
Hey. Hey, hey! Mr. Miyagi, look!

45:19.299 --> 45:20.134
Look.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.135
[chopsticks clatter]

45:22.136 --> 45:23.052
[Mr. Miyagi scoffs]

45:23.053 --> 45:25.179
[Mr. Miyagi] <i>You beginner luck.</i>

45:25.180 --> 45:28.015
- [buzzing continues]
- [poignant music continues]

45:28.016 --> 45:29.852
We'll always have the memories.

45:32.312 --> 45:34.314
[buzzing continues]

45:35.649 --> 45:37.651

[upbeat background music resumes]

45:45.451 --> 45:46.410
Got him.

45:47.745 --> 45:48.620
No mercy.
