WEBVTT

00:13.727 --> 00:15.938
Be honest with you,

00:15.938 --> 00:18.106
it don't bother me so much
in the daytime.

00:18.106 --> 00:20.692
It's at night when I lay down
and go to bed. I can't sleep.

00:20.692 --> 00:22.862
I toss and I turn. It's hell.

00:22.862 --> 00:26.948
Do you eat a lot of dairy? Milk,
cottage cheese, sour cream?

00:26.948 --> 00:28.450
Yes, all of it.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.119
I'm not a doctor, but it sounds to me

00:31.119 --> 00:36.082
like you might have a lactose allergy
or a lactose intolerance.

00:36.082 --> 00:37.209
Really?

00:37.209 --> 00:41.629
My suggestion is that you cut out
dairy from your diet completely.

00:41.629 --> 00:43.507
It's gonna be tough. I love cheese.

00:43.507 --> 00:46.969
Hey, who doesn't love a delicious
Camembert on a cracker? Come on.

00:46.969 --> 00:49.054
Camembert? What the fuck is that?

00:49.054 --> 00:52.141
- It's a soft cheese.
- I ain't ever heard of that shit.

00:52.141 --> 00:53.309
It's very good.

00:53.309 --> 00:56.687
I don't know how I'm gonna do it, man.
It's gonna be tough. That's all I eat.

00:56.687 --> 00:59.731
I know it's hard. I had to give up
Marcona almonds.

00:59.731 --> 01:01.149
Is that like a nut?

01:01.149 --> 01:04.361
Yeah, delicious. That with
some truffle oil and sea salt.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.655
Tremendous.

01:07.363 --> 01:09.616
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

01:09.616 --> 01:11.202
Okay.

01:11.202 --> 01:13.119
Larry David! You're free to go.

01:14.205 --> 01:17.333
- Look at you.
- Lawyer's here.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.292
Stay in touch, buddy.
Good to meet you.

01:19.292 --> 01:22.128
Mr. David, I'm Joe D'Angelo.
I'm an attorney.

01:22.128 --> 01:23.838
Your manager Jeff sent me.

01:23.838 --> 01:25.591
Hey, Larry, let me give you
my number, man.

01:26.175 --> 01:28.134
We can stay in touch, you know?

01:28.719 --> 01:30.762
- Hey, you got a phone on you?
- Sure.

01:30.762 --> 01:32.723
- You mind taking his number down?
- His number?

01:32.723 --> 01:39.103
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 404-892-8042.

01:39.103 --> 01:40.522
Yeah, I got it.

01:41.732 --> 01:44.276
Hit me up sometime, Larry.
Take it easy, buddy.

01:44.276 --> 01:46.570
- Thanks, fellas. Let's go.
- All yours.

01:47.654 --> 01:49.906
Listen, Larry, may I call you Larry?

01:49.906 --> 01:51.908
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Okay, listen to me, Larry.

01:51.908 --> 01:54.245
I got you out on an R.O.R.

01:54.245 --> 01:56.746
They're releasing you
on your own recognizance, okay?

01:57.915 --> 01:59.791
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

01:59.791 --> 02:00.960
Nothing.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.586
I didn't know it was against the law
to give someone a glass of water.

02:03.586 --> 02:05.380
Welcome to Georgia, my friend.

02:05.380 --> 02:10.093
Look, all I wanna do, all I wanna
do is plead guilty and go home.

02:10.093 --> 02:11.303
I wanna get the hell out of here.

02:11.303 --> 02:14.181
That's the plan. You plead guilty.
I get you out of here by Monday

02:14.181 --> 02:16.433
with the slap on the wrist. Okay?

02:16.433 --> 02:18.352
Let me ask you this.

02:18.352 --> 02:20.812
So this guy flies me out of here
to make an appearance

02:20.812 --> 02:23.523
at his birthday party,
and now he's not paying me.

02:23.523 --> 02:25.401
Let's stick with this
criminal case, okay?

02:25.401 --> 02:28.570
And then we can sit down
and maybe talk about the other thing.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.239
Yeah, Larry! You're my hero!

02:32.448 --> 02:34.493
- I love you, Larry!
- Look at this!

02:40.623 --> 02:43.459
Looks like you're some kind
of liberal darling.

02:46.170 --> 02:49.132
- Get the hell out of here. Come on.
- That's right.

02:49.132 --> 02:51.135
- Look at you.
- How could I not be here for you?

02:51.135 --> 02:52.511
What a pal.

02:53.011 --> 02:58.851
I got an Airbnb for us. I got all your
luggage there. You are all set.

02:58.851 --> 03:01.352
Hey, this is Joe D'Angelo.

03:01.352 --> 03:02.979
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.
How are you?

03:02.979 --> 03:05.441
- Joe?
- Nice to finally meet you.

03:05.441 --> 03:09.737
Nice meeting you, too. A pleasure.
Thank you for helping us out.

03:09.737 --> 03:13.281
Sure. Listen, I'll tell you what
I tell all my clients.

03:13.281 --> 03:16.285
Don't worry. You're in good hands.
Nice meeting you, Jeff.

03:21.207 --> 03:24.751
- Weird.
- lt's unbelievable. It's insane.

03:24.751 --> 03:26.420
He looks just like Mocha Joe.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.672
Have you ever seen an uncanny
resemblance like that in your life?

03:29.672 --> 03:32.885
I never saw him. I only talked to him.
He was recommended.

03:32.885 --> 03:34.135
He was, like, the best.

03:34.135 --> 03:37.598
But I have a natural antipathy towards
him because of Mocha Joe.

03:37.598 --> 03:40.058
Yeah. I'm so sorry that I hired him.

03:42.102 --> 03:44.772
Still the hair dye?
Still going with it, huh?

03:44.772 --> 03:46.606
Come on. I like it. I do.

03:46.606 --> 03:48.192
- I don't think you do.
- I like it.

03:48.192 --> 03:53.113
I know you don't.
You're not being honest with your pal.

03:53.113 --> 03:55.616
That's okay.
Let's go greet my public.

03:55.616 --> 03:57.284
Larry!

03:59.410 --> 04:02.039
Thank you! So nice of you.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.132
- So this is our rental?
- Yep.

04:12.174 --> 04:13.968
This is interesting.

04:13.968 --> 04:18.264
I actually read this in jail last night
in the Scientific American

04:18.264 --> 04:22.225
that for thousands of years humans
have been putting on their shoes

04:22.893 --> 04:25.896
using their index finger
as a shoehorn.

04:25.896 --> 04:29.524
And in some kind of Darwinian way
we've adapted

04:29.983 --> 04:32.527
and the index finger in a couple
of thousand years,

04:32.527 --> 04:34.487
it's gonna look like a shoehorn.

04:34.487 --> 04:37.365
The fuck are you talking about?
Shoehorn?

04:37.365 --> 04:40.244
No, look! You can see
it's getting flatter.

04:40.244 --> 04:43.872
They look like the other fingers.
What are you talking about?

04:43.872 --> 04:46.416
I think it's "Bullshit American".

04:46.416 --> 04:47.877
Looks like a shoehorn.

04:50.128 --> 04:52.672
What? What is this doing on the lawn?

04:52.672 --> 04:55.592
It came with the house.
You think I put it on the lawn?

04:55.592 --> 04:57.760
We didn't know it was there
until we moved in.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.181
- That's awful.
- Terrible.

05:00.181 --> 05:03.976
That's awful. I can't stay in a house
with that thing there.

05:04.310 --> 05:08.022
- A bottle of water. What?
- It's an outrageous law, Willie.

05:08.022 --> 05:11.774
But come on, you got to take
your hat off to Larry David.

05:11.774 --> 05:14.862
It had to be done.
And dammit, he did it.

05:14.862 --> 05:16.113
Hey!

05:16.113 --> 05:19.574
What's with that thing out there?
The lawn jockey.

05:19.574 --> 05:23.537
I know. We're in the south.
That's what they have.

05:23.537 --> 05:26.707
- We got to get rid of that thing.
- You're not getting rid of it.

05:26.707 --> 05:28.708
I can't stay in this house
with that thing outside.

05:28.708 --> 05:31.337
- I'm not comfortable.
- This is an Airbnb.

05:31.337 --> 05:34.964
I gave a security deposit.
Just leave it the fuck alone.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.509
You see what's going on here?

05:36.509 --> 05:37.884
It's a courageous stand.

05:37.884 --> 05:40.596
I mean, you know, maybe
it's not Rosa Parks on the bus,

05:40.596 --> 05:42.890
but you know, this is pretty important.

05:42.890 --> 05:44.140
This is amazing.

05:44.140 --> 05:47.727
I don't wanna get all preachy about
this, but what did Jesus say?

05:47.727 --> 05:50.146
"I was thirsty
and you gave me water."

05:50.146 --> 05:51.607
That's what Larry did here.

05:51.607 --> 05:55.109
And I'm just wondering, are
Republicans, like, really gonna push

05:55.109 --> 05:57.445
getting this guy into jail?

05:58.072 --> 06:00.074
The story gaining momentum, too.

06:00.074 --> 06:03.410
Political figures, celebrities across
the country reacting

06:03.410 --> 06:05.578
to Larry David's brave stand.

06:05.578 --> 06:08.290
Larry David is about action,
not words.

06:08.706 --> 06:12.752
He saw an injustice and he did
what he could to right it.

06:12.752 --> 06:14.587
And that's what we need today
in America.

06:14.587 --> 06:17.091
- It's a cause celeb.
- Larry David took a big risk.

06:17.091 --> 06:20.928
He put his name
and his body on the line.

06:20.928 --> 06:22.429
You're like a hero or something.

06:23.222 --> 06:26.225
"Involvement".
That's Larry David's middle name.

06:26.809 --> 06:29.103
Larry "Involvement" David.

06:29.103 --> 06:30.521
Can you believe that?

06:30.521 --> 06:33.399
This Larry David they're talking
about seems like quite a fellow.

06:33.399 --> 06:35.900
- He is.
- But we know better.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.903
You must be exhausted. Do you want
a cup of coffee? I got coffee made.

06:38.903 --> 06:41.698
That would be great.
Thank you very much.

06:41.698 --> 06:44.158
Hey, what's going on with Hulu?

06:44.158 --> 06:46.370
11:00 tomorrow morning,
we got a Zoom call.

06:48.162 --> 06:51.291
Tomorrow you have a Zoom call?
I don't think so, Jeff.

06:51.291 --> 06:54.170
You're gonna have to change that.
What the hell's the matter with you?

06:54.170 --> 06:55.503
Shit. It's your birthday.

06:55.503 --> 06:58.506
Yes, exactly.
No Zooming on my birthday.

06:58.506 --> 07:03.220
- No work on my birthday.
- What is that, a national holiday?

07:03.220 --> 07:05.805
It's a sacred day for Jeff and me.

07:05.805 --> 07:07.891
Is he allowed to go to the bathroom?

07:07.891 --> 07:09.685
Yes, he can go to the bathroom, Larry.

07:09.685 --> 07:14.690
And you could do whatever the fuck
you want, but Jeff is mine all day.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.482
What are you, ten years old?
Come on.

07:16.482 --> 07:19.569
You know, if I wasn't born, think
the whole world would be shit.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.448
If this was that movie
with the Jimmy Stewart...

07:22.448 --> 07:23.949
It's a Wonderful Life.

07:23.949 --> 07:27.536
Yeah, and the angel was taking you
around. Nobody would give a fuck.

07:28.329 --> 07:31.373
Very funny. Getting you coffee.

07:33.124 --> 07:36.753
This is just insanity.
And you know what?

07:37.505 --> 07:40.882
I got to get her a gift. I don't know
where to go, what to get her.

07:40.882 --> 07:42.718
It's always a disappointment,

07:42.718 --> 07:45.512
and I don't wanna break the bank.
It's so frustrating.

07:45.512 --> 07:48.516
What a thing to go through. You have
to think about another person.

07:48.516 --> 07:49.933
It's just terrible.

07:51.977 --> 07:53.645
This is a possibility for you.

07:54.271 --> 07:56.523
You don't wanna spend
too much money, right?

07:57.191 --> 07:59.151
And yet you wanna make her happy.

07:59.151 --> 08:02.195
You get two gifts,
but you only give her one

08:02.195 --> 08:04.365
and see how she reacts to the one.

08:04.365 --> 08:07.450
If you see she's a little disappointed
'cause it's just one,

08:07.450 --> 08:09.245
then you bring out the second.

08:09.245 --> 08:12.498
And if she's happy with the one,
then you return the second.

08:12.498 --> 08:15.667
How did I not think of that?
So simple. Look at that.

08:16.584 --> 08:18.587
- Thanks.
- What the fuck?

08:23.633 --> 08:26.177
- What is that, man?
- Yeah, I know. It's terrible.

08:26.177 --> 08:28.806
You know? You guys have
to walk by him when you came in?

08:28.806 --> 08:32.518
I don't know. I just saw it
for the first time two minutes ago.

08:32.518 --> 08:35.312
- You fist bumped this motherfucker?
- No, we don't fist bump.

08:35.312 --> 08:36.521
Hey, what's up?

08:36.521 --> 08:39.190
You know what? Let's put it
in the garage. This is crazy.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.359
- You want to?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:41.359 --> 08:43.361
Jeez. Get him the fuck out of here.

08:45.406 --> 08:48.783
This is heavy, man. What the fuck?
Are you guys doing anything?

08:48.783 --> 08:52.705
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
- Are you okay?

08:53.497 --> 08:54.790
Shit!

08:56.625 --> 08:58.126
- Oh man!
- Come on!

09:00.504 --> 09:01.629
Look what you did.

09:01.629 --> 09:03.965
What I did? I knew
you would say that shit.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.092
I had the heaviest part.

09:05.092 --> 09:07.845
You got the heaviest part? You
volunteered for the heaviest part.

09:07.845 --> 09:09.513
You said you wanted to stay
in the back.

09:10.431 --> 09:14.559
What the hell happened?
What did you guys do?

09:14.559 --> 09:15.977
We had an accident.

09:16.395 --> 09:19.606
Why did you even move the fucking
thing? This is not our house.

09:20.065 --> 09:22.276
Well, you're gonna have
to just find another one.

09:22.276 --> 09:25.154
Cause I am not eating the security
deposit. You hear me?

09:25.154 --> 09:29.200
Go buy a new one right now.
The exact same one!

09:29.657 --> 09:31.367
Can we do it on your birthday?

09:32.410 --> 09:33.746
Jesus.

09:34.914 --> 09:37.291
I'm gonna take a shower
and then we'll...

09:37.291 --> 09:39.042
How am I gonna find one
of these things?

09:39.042 --> 09:41.377
Don't forget, we got to get
Susie's gift. All right?

09:42.880 --> 09:46.634
This is so damn overwhelming.
I don't know what to get her.

09:46.634 --> 09:50.094
I don't envy you.
This is impossible.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.096
Hey, you're the guy
that gave that lady the water.

09:52.096 --> 09:54.182
Right! I'm the guy.

09:55.017 --> 09:56.852
And you're the guy that's wearing
a sweater

09:56.852 --> 09:59.354
tied around his motherfucking neck.
How about that?

09:59.354 --> 10:02.232
Hey, right there.
Look at this place.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.399
Let's do it.

10:06.445 --> 10:09.615
This really looks like a Susie store.
Look at this stuff.

10:09.615 --> 10:11.908
It's pretty horrible.
What about this thing?

10:12.743 --> 10:14.578
That looks fucking perfect.

10:14.578 --> 10:18.082
I'm going over to Sunglass Hut.
I'm getting gift number one.

10:18.082 --> 10:21.417
You two scout for gift number two.
All right. I'll see you in a minute.

10:21.793 --> 10:25.839
This is so stupid. I'm looking to shop
for Susie? This is insane.

10:25.839 --> 10:29.759
What do you buy a person who
already has bullshit like this bullshit?

10:29.759 --> 10:34.598
Hey, you know what?
I got a big job.

10:35.641 --> 10:36.808
Okay.

10:36.808 --> 10:41.772
I gotta drop the kids off at the pool.
You think they have a bathroom here?

10:41.772 --> 10:45.442
They have a bathroom.
But you can't use the bathroom

10:45.442 --> 10:48.070
unless you buy something.
That's how they do it.

10:49.196 --> 10:52.867
Hello, gentlemen.
May I help you find something?

10:52.867 --> 10:55.077
No. You know, we're just browsing.

10:55.077 --> 10:57.288
We just got some gorgeous
wide brimmed hats in.

10:57.288 --> 11:01.165
- Fedoras? I love a Fedora.
- Would you like to see any?

11:02.251 --> 11:05.504
I'm wondering, do you have
a restroom l could use?

11:05.504 --> 11:07.465
- You have to use the restroom?
- Yeah.

11:08.089 --> 11:11.385
- Right now?
- Kinda, yeah.

11:11.886 --> 11:14.138
Yeah. Right this way.

11:42.081 --> 11:45.169
- Look who showed up. Susie.
- Let's go.

11:46.212 --> 11:49.255
Excuse me. Is there anything else
I can help you with?

11:49.255 --> 11:51.883
I know you were interested
in the fedoras. I can show you those.

11:51.883 --> 11:56.347
You know, on second thought,
I don't think so.

11:56.347 --> 11:59.725
Well, the restroom is
for paying customers only.

11:59.725 --> 12:02.519
Well, I browsed with intent to buy,

12:02.519 --> 12:06.357
but unfortunately, I didn't really see
anything that was of interest to me.

12:06.814 --> 12:08.359
In your previous condition,

12:09.026 --> 12:11.362
how much would you have paid
to use the restroom?

12:13.155 --> 12:15.698
- 500.
- 500?

12:17.076 --> 12:21.539
I cannot believe I found a pair, but
I found the perfect pair for her.

12:21.539 --> 12:22.747
Fantastic.

12:22.747 --> 12:24.500
I got mine. What'd you guys
come up with?

12:24.917 --> 12:27.585
What did we come up...

12:27.585 --> 12:31.132
Well, we've been browsing

12:31.132 --> 12:36.512
and we've come up with that purse.

12:36.512 --> 12:41.058
That purse. That's perfect.
Thank you both. Great call.

12:41.058 --> 12:46.104
Yes, we found that in the store.
See, I'm a customer.

12:46.104 --> 12:50.067
No, he's a customer. You're just
his friend who pooped in our toilet.

13:19.638 --> 13:21.681
Can I help you find anything?

13:22.266 --> 13:23.684
- Hey there.
- How you doing?

13:23.684 --> 13:30.273
Good. Interested in buying...
A lawn jockey they're called, right?

13:30.273 --> 13:33.776
- Yeah, that's exactly what they are.
- Yeah. A lawn jockey.

13:33.776 --> 13:39.325
I noticed that they're all pretty much
the same, you know, ethnicity.

13:42.578 --> 13:47.291
Wondering if perhaps you had
any darker ones.

13:48.374 --> 13:49.542
Darker how?

13:51.170 --> 13:52.463
Black?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.173
You want a Black one?

13:55.716 --> 14:00.345
It's not what you think.
It's a long story.

14:00.345 --> 14:03.974
Yeah, it's like 400 years long.
Starts in Nigeria.

14:03.974 --> 14:08.270
Believe me, I have the same aversion
to them as you do.

14:09.438 --> 14:10.856
But you're looking for one.

14:10.856 --> 14:13.317
Again, it's a long story.

14:13.317 --> 14:16.445
I have nothing to do with it.
I just have to replace it, really.

14:16.445 --> 14:18.280
So you already had one.

14:20.156 --> 14:23.744
You know this one? This one looks
very similar to the...

14:25.370 --> 14:26.955
The Black one.

14:27.372 --> 14:33.045
Let me ask you this question.
Do you sell black paint?

14:33.878 --> 14:36.173
No, we don't have black paint here.

14:37.091 --> 14:38.259
Shoe polish?

14:38.259 --> 14:41.135
No, we don't have any shoe polish.
We don't have any tar.

14:42.971 --> 14:45.098
Okay. You know what?

14:45.974 --> 14:49.061
I think I'm gonna get that one,
and l think I can work with that.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.569
- It's White.
- Yeah, I know.

14:58.154 --> 15:01.198
Something about him, too.
I can't put my finger on it.

15:01.198 --> 15:02.907
Why didn't you go to a paint store?

15:02.907 --> 15:05.202
I looked. I couldn't find a paint store
that was open.

15:05.202 --> 15:08.288
Susie will be here any minute.
What are we gonna do?

15:08.288 --> 15:10.206
Got any shoe polish?

15:11.083 --> 15:12.709
I don't have shoe polish.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.176
What are you looking at?

15:31.437 --> 15:32.605
Pretty good.

15:32.605 --> 15:35.941
This is great. Great idea.
Susie's here. Let's go!

15:38.944 --> 15:40.112
Fuck!

15:41.822 --> 15:45.700
Oh, hey! Hey, hey.

15:46.451 --> 15:48.036
Let's see.

15:49.788 --> 15:54.084
- Okay. It's the same?
- I brought the head with me. Yeah.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.628
You brought the head with you?

16:03.176 --> 16:05.304
- All right, you're off the hook.
- We are off the hook.

16:05.304 --> 16:07.847
Don't do any more stupid shit,
the three of you.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.475
No more stupid shit.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.726
Wasn't eating that security deposit.

16:12.478 --> 16:13.686
Okay.

16:15.813 --> 16:19.401
How about that?
How about them apples? Great!

16:20.360 --> 16:21.570
Let's clean this shit up.

16:23.447 --> 16:27.451
So for thousands of years, humans
have been putting on their shoes

16:27.451 --> 16:30.495
using their index finger as a shoehorn.

16:30.495 --> 16:33.833
And in time, our index fingers
have been...

16:35.583 --> 16:37.753
- Happy birthday!
- For me?

16:39.504 --> 16:43.049
Oh, baby doll. Oh, baby.

16:44.050 --> 16:47.763
- Sunglasses.
- Fantastic.

16:48.597 --> 16:50.056
You like 'em?

16:50.056 --> 16:53.309
- I like 'em. Let me look.
- She likes them.

16:53.309 --> 16:56.021
- I do like 'em.
- Let me see.

16:56.021 --> 16:59.607
As many women from Long Island
would say, to die for.

16:59.607 --> 17:03.696
That's true. And you know what? It's
a nice memento of our trip to Atlanta.

17:03.696 --> 17:06.614
I love them. You did good, babe.

17:06.614 --> 17:08.575
I did good.

17:09.909 --> 17:13.037
The texts just keep coming in.
The birthday wishes.

17:13.037 --> 17:16.041
- Oh, boy. Oh, jeez.
- What's the matter?

17:16.041 --> 17:20.420
I hate to bring this up, but I got this
meeting with my lawyer now.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.255
Well, go.
We'll see you later.

17:22.255 --> 17:24.675
I mean, the problem is
I can't really go alone

17:24.675 --> 17:28.011
'cause I don't know what the hell
I'm doing, and if I could bring Jeff...

17:28.011 --> 17:32.140
l know it's your birthday. I'm sorry
to ask, but this is important,

17:32.140 --> 17:34.727
and I just need him there for support.

17:34.727 --> 17:37.395
- You do realize it's her birthday?
- Well, I know it's her birthday.

17:37.395 --> 17:39.105
I tried to change it to another day,

17:39.105 --> 17:41.274
but he said the papers
had to be filed by today.

17:41.274 --> 17:43.319
All right. You know what?

17:44.361 --> 17:49.490
This is real life. This is important.
You go. Come right back.

17:49.490 --> 17:51.868
- Back before you know it.
- An hour, hour and a half?

17:51.868 --> 17:54.287
It's not gonna take long at all,
I promise.

17:54.287 --> 17:55.747
Sammy just called.

17:57.373 --> 18:01.086
By the way, the upshot
of the article?

18:01.086 --> 18:06.257
That in thousands of years, our index
fingers are gonna resemble shoehorns.

18:06.257 --> 18:11.429
Check it out. You can see it.
You see the shape of it? Look. Flat.

18:16.601 --> 18:18.646
- Unbelievable, right?
- Look at this.

18:19.438 --> 18:21.482
- This is expensive too, huh?
- Yeah.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.442
Hey, you were right. Thank you.

18:24.442 --> 18:25.611
Let's go return it.

18:30.282 --> 18:35.538
Another fucking gift?
You two sneaky cock suckers.

18:35.871 --> 18:38.874
What are they doing with that?
Fucking idiots.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.754
Excuse me, I'd like to return this.

18:47.131 --> 18:49.759
- You wanna return it?
- Yes, please. Here.

18:49.759 --> 18:53.556
- You feel comfortable with this?
- What are you talking about?

18:53.556 --> 18:56.850
- After what you did.
- What did I do? I didn't do anything.

18:56.850 --> 18:59.228
I used the bathroom.
What a crime I committed.

18:59.228 --> 19:01.397
I used the precious bathroom.

19:01.397 --> 19:03.899
Hey, this isn't even mine.
I'm not even the customer.

19:03.899 --> 19:05.400
He's the customer. I didn't buy it.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.485
Yeah, exactly. You weren't a customer,

19:07.485 --> 19:09.529
and you had no intention of ever being
a customer.

19:09.529 --> 19:12.198
You just go into random stores and
use them as your public restroom.

19:12.198 --> 19:14.660
All right. Okay. It's enough!

19:14.660 --> 19:18.204
Okay, I'll buy something.
Will that make you happy?

19:18.204 --> 19:21.208
- Yes.
- What? What can I buy in this store?

19:21.208 --> 19:22.751
I have just the thing.

19:25.211 --> 19:28.089
I think this would bring out your eyes.

19:29.717 --> 19:32.260
- Does bring out your eyes.
- Really?

19:35.346 --> 19:36.973
- Fabulous.
- This is amazing.

19:36.973 --> 19:39.435
It's not the kind of thing I would
generally wear, but...

19:39.435 --> 19:41.311
- No, it works.
- I'll ring it up.

19:41.311 --> 19:44.106
- A Southern gentleman.
- I'll take it.

19:44.106 --> 19:47.026
- Brings out my eyes.
- That'll be 650.

19:56.701 --> 20:01.081
All right. This won't be long.
I'll text you when I'm done.

20:01.081 --> 20:04.834
All right. Well, good luck to you.
Tell the lawyer I said hey.

20:06.961 --> 20:11.509
I thought I was gon' faint, you know?
And when I told him how thirsty I was,

20:11.509 --> 20:14.345
he just went to the car and got me
a bottle of water

20:14.345 --> 20:17.138
and it really made me feel
so much better.

20:17.138 --> 20:18.808
See? Thank you, baby.

20:18.808 --> 20:20.975
And how long would you say
you were on line?

20:20.975 --> 20:23.938
At the voting?
It was over two and a half hours.

20:23.938 --> 20:25.396
What a disgrace.

20:25.396 --> 20:28.984
Okay, so look, as your attorney,
I just wanna be above board.

20:28.984 --> 20:32.779
When we get in front of the judge,
you're going to plead guilty, correct?

20:32.779 --> 20:34.280
- Yeah.
- Wait!

20:34.280 --> 20:38.493
Larry. I thought that you was
gonna help us fight this evil law.

20:38.493 --> 20:40.454
You gon' plead guilty?

20:40.454 --> 20:42.706
What you mean
you're gon' plead guilty, Larry?

20:42.706 --> 20:43.957
He has to plead guilty.

20:43.957 --> 20:47.503
Larry is here to help us fight
for our cause.

20:47.503 --> 20:50.798
I am gonna fight.
I'll fight it in my own way.

20:50.798 --> 20:56.469
So what you mean is you're gonna
do it no way. Larry...

20:56.469 --> 20:57.596
I don't wanna go to jail!

20:57.596 --> 21:01.683
Larry, people are thinking you a hero.
I thought you were better than that.

21:01.683 --> 21:06.730
I really did.
Leon, I smell something burning.

21:06.730 --> 21:10.151
You better not be throwing
no spaghetti up in my ceiling.

21:10.151 --> 21:12.486
We ran out of spaghetti sauce,
so I had to use ketchup.

21:12.486 --> 21:14.153
Boy, what are you cooking over here?

21:14.153 --> 21:16.990
I'm doing the best I can with just
Heinz Ketchup and spaghetti.

21:16.990 --> 21:19.994
- You're still pleading guilty, right?
- Oh, yeah.

21:19.994 --> 21:21.287
Good.

21:23.037 --> 21:27.458
Man. This woman's coffee.
Have you had this woman's coffee?

21:27.458 --> 21:32.298
It's amazing. You know, I wanted to ask
her where she got the beans.

21:33.799 --> 21:35.926
It's got to be the beans, you know?

21:35.926 --> 21:37.803
It's the beans,
like my old man used to say.

21:39.137 --> 21:42.391
All about the beans. You don't have
the beans, you don't have the coffee.

21:43.308 --> 21:45.019
You like coffee, Larry?

21:45.019 --> 21:47.146
Try this coffee. Have a sip
of this coffee, Larry.

21:47.146 --> 21:49.105
Good coffee is all about the beans.

21:49.105 --> 21:52.151
I'm gonna ask her where
she get these beans.

21:52.483 --> 21:56.489
Have you had this coffee, Larry?
You like coffee, Larry?

22:00.493 --> 22:03.621
- Can't do this anymore.
- What's wrong?

22:04.288 --> 22:08.584
You remind me of someone I detest.

22:10.501 --> 22:11.629
Sorry.

22:17.176 --> 22:18.385
How'd it go?

22:20.054 --> 22:22.180
- Fired the lawyer.
- Mocha Joe?

22:23.306 --> 22:24.433
Mocha Joe.

22:25.850 --> 22:28.312
Is it a million degrees
or is it my imagination?

22:28.312 --> 22:31.524
It's unbelievable. It's scorching.

22:37.738 --> 22:42.033
I cannot believe this weather.
Is it hot here? Crazy.

22:42.033 --> 22:44.118
It's like nothing I've ever experienced.

22:46.996 --> 22:49.082
Something you wanna tell me, huh?

22:52.336 --> 22:53.879
Where have you been?

22:54.546 --> 22:56.297
Well, I went to the lawyer.

22:56.297 --> 22:59.343
The lawyer?
You went to the lawyer?

23:00.427 --> 23:04.430
With a gift box?
You went to the fucking lawyer?

23:04.430 --> 23:06.851
Well, it was just to show
my appreciation.

23:06.851 --> 23:10.354
Oh, really? And how did
Perry Mason like his gift?

23:11.397 --> 23:13.482
- Liked it.
- Yeah, he liked it.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.650
You were so full of shit, both of you.

23:15.650 --> 23:19.612
'Cause I saw you on the video
up in the tree house,

23:19.612 --> 23:21.906
taking that box out. What do you got?

23:21.906 --> 23:25.911
Like a Georgia whore
who you're giving gifts to?

23:25.911 --> 23:27.370
No Georgia whore.

23:27.370 --> 23:29.163
Well, who the fuck was that gift for?

23:29.163 --> 23:32.918
I saw you all taking it out and all,
"look, I got it. I'm all excited."

23:32.918 --> 23:35.503
And you two high fiving.
Who was the gift for you?

23:36.088 --> 23:37.255
You.

23:37.255 --> 23:40.091
You think I got to believe
that bullshit? Then where is it?

23:40.801 --> 23:41.926
I returned it.

23:42.802 --> 23:45.222
- You returned it?
- It was expensive.

23:45.222 --> 23:46.890
So what?

23:47.390 --> 23:50.351
You liked the first one,
so the second one was unnecessary.

23:50.351 --> 23:52.896
You couldn't give me two fucking
gifts. What was it?

23:53.522 --> 23:54.815
A purse.

23:54.815 --> 24:00.905
So on my birthday, you spend
your day returning my birthday gift.

24:00.905 --> 24:03.949
That's a wonderful use of time,
both of you.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.037
Oh my God.

24:09.455 --> 24:10.914
What's going on here?

24:14.752 --> 24:16.586
What the fuck is this?

24:18.631 --> 24:20.006
Hair dye.

24:20.966 --> 24:24.345
All right, you two. You have really gone
too far this time.

24:24.345 --> 24:28.808
Go out and get me a Black jockey
right now! You better fucking find one.

24:28.808 --> 24:31.435
And I want that purse back, too.

24:31.435 --> 24:34.814
It's Giuliani. No wonder I thought
he looked like an asshole.

24:34.814 --> 24:36.565
- Just go!
- Giuliani!

24:36.565 --> 24:41.570
Go! Now! It's my fucking birthday.
You're ruining it.

24:48.035 --> 24:49.662
All right, Leon. Where do we go?

24:49.662 --> 24:51.997
You got to ride a little further out
if you wanna find one.

24:51.997 --> 24:53.873
Well, direct us.
What should we do?

24:53.873 --> 24:56.251
Just keep fucking driving.
I'll tell you where to fucking turn.

24:58.378 --> 25:01.841
Look, this whole Black lawn jockey shit
is bullshit anyway.

25:01.841 --> 25:04.133
You know, it should be
something more respectable.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.011
Like a fucking Black lawn doctor

25:06.011 --> 25:08.221
with a stethoscope
around his fucking neck.

25:08.221 --> 25:10.182
Giving motherfuckers
checkups and shit.

25:10.182 --> 25:14.269
Or a fucking lawyer holding
a briefcase and shit.

25:16.104 --> 25:19.983
- Look, right there.
- That's good.

25:19.983 --> 25:22.068
Hey, good afternoon. I'm wondering

25:22.068 --> 25:24.613
if you might be interested
in selling your lawn jockey.

25:24.613 --> 25:25.738
No.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.409
No!

25:29.075 --> 25:30.410
Get out of here!

25:33.164 --> 25:34.289
Yeah?

25:34.289 --> 25:37.042
Good afternoon.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

25:37.042 --> 25:38.793
I recognize you.

25:38.793 --> 25:43.673
You're the wing nut that came down
here is messing with our elections.

25:43.673 --> 25:45.092
Yep. That's me.

25:45.092 --> 25:47.470
What the hell you want
with my lawn jockey?

25:47.470 --> 25:50.681
My sister's an avowed racist,
and she's very sick.

25:50.681 --> 25:52.348
I thought this might cheer her up.

25:53.933 --> 25:57.228
- That sounds familiar.
- Nothing. No luck.

25:58.230 --> 26:03.110
Well, what are we gonna do?
We got to do something.

26:05.154 --> 26:06.530
Who are you calling?

26:07.865 --> 26:11.075
Hell! Larry!
What are you doing, big guy?

26:11.075 --> 26:12.244
Hey, Emmett.

26:12.244 --> 26:16.165
Listen, I got to tell you something.
I cut out dairy like you said,

26:16.165 --> 26:20.501
and everything is better in my life.
I feel like a million damn dollars.

26:20.501 --> 26:22.129
That's fantastic.

26:22.129 --> 26:23.923
It's all 'cause of you, Larry.

26:23.923 --> 26:25.465
I just can't thank you enough.

26:25.465 --> 26:28.427
I wish there was a way
I could repay you somehow.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.428
Actually...

26:31.764 --> 26:33.973
Be careful, it's fragile.

26:33.973 --> 26:36.268
Got it. Now slide it that way.
Pull the bottom down that way.

26:36.268 --> 26:38.478
It's bottom heavy.
It should be fine like that.

26:38.478 --> 26:40.855
- Thank you, Emmett.
- Yeah, no problem.

26:40.855 --> 26:43.025
- Thanks so much.
- Hey, my pleasure, Larry.

26:43.025 --> 26:46.362
I'll tell you, ever since l quit
this lactose business,

26:46.362 --> 26:49.573
I'm turning over a new leaf. That little
statue I got from the church?

26:49.573 --> 26:52.451
That's the last thing I'm ever stealing.

26:52.451 --> 26:54.619
- Stay right there.
- What?

26:54.619 --> 26:55.996
Don't you move.

26:57.705 --> 27:02.336
The hell's this?
What the hell is...

27:02.336 --> 27:04.088
- Go ahead.
- This for me?

27:04.088 --> 27:05.714
Try it on.

27:05.714 --> 27:08.050
- Oh shit!
- There you go.

27:08.050 --> 27:10.009
Good Lord.

27:10.009 --> 27:12.972
You do Larry David a solid,
that's what you get in return.

27:12.972 --> 27:14.849
God almighty, man.

27:17.058 --> 27:19.186
You are a real Southern gentleman.

27:19.186 --> 27:21.313
- Fits perfect.
- Great to meet you.

27:21.313 --> 27:22.690
Pleasure meetin' you.

27:23.983 --> 27:28.278
Y'all drive safe, all right?
You come back to Atlanta any time.

27:30.990 --> 27:33.199
Pastor, y'all having a good time?

27:33.199 --> 27:34.450
Yes, Miss Rae.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.662
Listen here now. I want y'all to eat
as much as you can, all right?

27:38.330 --> 27:41.499
Chester, you better put
some more ribs on this plate.

27:41.499 --> 27:45.546
- One rib. What do you thinking, boy?
- Yes, ma'am, I got ya.

27:45.546 --> 27:48.298
- God. Look at all these people.
- Yeah. Church barbecue.

27:50.801 --> 27:52.678
- See you later.
- Hey, Leon.

27:52.678 --> 27:54.638
Is Larry with you?

27:54.638 --> 27:59.309
- Larry's right there.
- Come on, Larry. Get out the car.

27:59.309 --> 28:03.438
Everybody, this is Larry David.
Give him a big round of applause, y'all.

28:03.438 --> 28:06.692
- Say, "Hi, Larry".
- Hello, everyone.

28:06.692 --> 28:08.651
See all these people? They love you.

28:08.651 --> 28:10.613
I know you're not gonna
disappoint them.

28:10.613 --> 28:13.741
So come on. Get out that car
and get you something to eat, boy.

28:13.741 --> 28:16.242
Okay, I'm coming.

28:16.242 --> 28:19.788
Give him another big round
of applause, y'all. Larry David.

28:21.499 --> 28:24.919
- Least I could do.
- Jeff, right?

28:24.919 --> 28:26.836
- Yeah.
- Come on and get you some, too.

28:26.836 --> 28:28.922
I want you to meet
Pastor Sherman, okay?

28:28.922 --> 28:31.175
Hey, would it be okay
if I use the bathroom?

28:31.175 --> 28:32.634
Right through there.
Go ahead.

28:38.224 --> 28:40.059
Hey, you see this guy right here?

28:40.643 --> 28:43.895
That does not look like his jacket.
Let's light him up.

28:49.485 --> 28:52.195
What the hell is this?
You gotta be kidding me.

28:52.822 --> 28:54.572
Where you get this jacket, sir?

28:54.572 --> 28:56.742
It was a gift.

28:56.742 --> 28:59.744
A gift? Why is the tag
still on there, sir?

29:00.663 --> 29:02.330
Honestly, I didn't know it was on there.

29:02.330 --> 29:04.123
Let me see your driver's license.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.251
Shit.

29:14.634 --> 29:16.762
Come with me.
You're under arrest.

29:16.762 --> 29:21.767
This is bullshit, man. What the fuck?
I didn't fucking steal it!

29:21.767 --> 29:23.811
It was from my friend Larry.

29:23.811 --> 29:28.731
Some crazy old man I met in jail talking
about almonds. Come on. Fuck.

29:28.731 --> 29:31.986
Hey, Jeff.
How you enjoying them ribs?

29:31.986 --> 29:33.862
They got a kick to 'em.
You know that?

29:33.862 --> 29:36.239
- Man, they're delightful.
- I'm glad you loving them.

29:36.239 --> 29:39.617
Chester. I need you to box up
some more of those ribs

29:39.617 --> 29:41.871
so that Jeff can take them home
with him.

29:41.871 --> 29:43.080
Coming up.

29:44.831 --> 29:49.502
Larry David. I'm Pastor Sherman.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

29:49.502 --> 29:50.713
Nice to meet you.

29:50.713 --> 29:52.338
Let me introduce you
to the congregation.

29:52.338 --> 29:55.049
Saints, listen!

29:55.926 --> 30:00.722
This man is an inspiration.

30:01.806 --> 30:03.434
lt's gone a little overboard.

30:03.434 --> 30:07.354
You see, Larry David... Or should
I call you Larry Daniel?

30:07.354 --> 30:09.814
Okay. Because just like Daniel,

30:09.814 --> 30:13.735
he walked into the lion's den
without fear.

30:13.735 --> 30:17.363
I like the sound of that. Larry Daniel.
Maybe I'll change my last name.

30:18.574 --> 30:23.829
Larry is that powerful man today for
the Black community here in Atlanta.

30:26.497 --> 30:29.793
No, no, no!

30:32.337 --> 30:33.923
What the fuck?

30:34.256 --> 30:36.216
Are you shitting me, Larry?

30:38.009 --> 30:43.057
- Motherfucker's got a lawn jockey!
- What is wrong with you, man?

30:43.057 --> 30:45.350
- It makes me sick!
- No, no!

30:48.686 --> 30:49.939
Get out of here, man.

30:52.525 --> 30:55.735
- Hey, hey! It's not mine!
- Bye, Larry!

30:56.654 --> 30:58.613
Mr. David, you've been charged

30:58.613 --> 31:02.742
with obstruction of the election
process in the state of Georgia.

31:02.742 --> 31:05.454
And if you're found guilty at trial,
you'll be subject to a fine

31:05.454 --> 31:07.997
of 10 000 dollars
and up to a year in prison.

31:08.748 --> 31:10.167
How do you plead, sir?

31:17.258 --> 31:18.509
Not guilty.

31:19.217 --> 31:21.594
Now, that's the Larry David I know.

31:21.594 --> 31:24.807
Trial set for 90 days hence.
Next case!

31:24.807 --> 31:27.351
That's why I already made a big
ole pot

31:27.351 --> 31:29.228
of those put your foot in it greens.

31:35.025 --> 31:36.569
We going back to the house!
