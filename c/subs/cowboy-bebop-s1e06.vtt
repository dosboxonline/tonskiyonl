[jazz music playing]

00:14.723 --> 00:17.142
[Mel] It's a miracle
that you were ever airborne

00:17.225 --> 00:18.476
with all the chewing gum and duct tape.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.938
I mean, you've got [grunts]
actual duct tape.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.984
Find the last person who wrenched in here
and put a bullet in him.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.610
Yeah. You know what? Put two.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.904
I was the last person
who wrenched around in there.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.281
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.615
You do your own dental work too?

00:32.699 --> 00:35.326
It was working just fine
until last night, thank you.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.705
All right, let's open her up.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.174
Please tell me you didn't plug the g-line
straight into the pin port.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.009
Well, it ups the drag.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.469
Yeah, while over-stressing the converters.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.804
And when they fail,
you're crushed in a heartburn.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.972
[cell phone beeping]

00:56.806 --> 00:59.851
And you've got copper soldering
all over the connectors.

00:59.934 --> 01:00.769
[cell phone beeps]

01:00.852 --> 01:03.688
Look, I know what you're trying to do,
and it's not going to work.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.606
What?

01:05.231 --> 01:08.151
Oh, you think I'm feeding you bullshit
so I can gouge you on parts and labor?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.069
[cell phone beeps]

01:09.152 --> 01:11.321
Way to perpetuate the mechanic stereotype.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.115
Just because it's a stereotype
doesn't mean it's not true.

01:14.949 --> 01:19.913
What you need is a J92 stabilizing coil.
I've got a brand new one in the truck.

01:19.996 --> 01:23.041
15K installed,
and your problems are solved.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.294
Hmm. I bet I could grab one refurbished
down in the street

01:26.377 --> 01:27.545
for half my ham sandwich.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.339
I bet you could,
but the reason that you're grounded

01:29.422 --> 01:31.382
is because
you probably salvaged this one, right?

01:31.466 --> 01:32.425
For a ham sandwich.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.010
Or the ham.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.386
Look,

01:36.971 --> 01:39.724
just do yourself and your crew a favor.
Buy the new one off me.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.892
Not for that price.

01:40.975 --> 01:44.145
Look, just get her serviced, right?
And prep for install.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.438
[cell phone beeps]

01:45.522 --> 01:46.981
Jesus Christ!

01:49.609 --> 01:50.443
Asshole.

[jazz music playing]

02:39.409 --> 02:40.368
[knock at door]

02:41.327 --> 02:42.162
Yep.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.790
-The mechanic has us by the sack-hairs.
-Uh-huh.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.084
-Says we need a new stabilizing coil.
-Mm.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.336
Which is going to
seriously drain the kitty.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.880
-There's always something.
-Yeah.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.674
Since we're going to be grounded
for a few more hours,

02:54.757 --> 02:55.842
maybe you can make yourself useful.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.303
-More useful than normal?
-That'd be a win.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.515
Maybe you could rustle us up some scratch.
I've got a lead from Radical Ed.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
-The hacker?
-That's right.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.229
-Making it super reliable.
-It's new information on an old bounty.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
[exhales]

03:10.273 --> 03:11.107
All right.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.027
Fine. [exhales]

03:16.196 --> 03:17.614
-Hit me.
-Cy-Baba.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.450
The "Let Go" Guru?

03:21.659 --> 03:24.329
No. Wait, what was his shit again?

03:25.121 --> 03:28.583
The "Free your mind
and the rest will follow"?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.960
His shit killed 3,000 people

03:31.044 --> 03:34.255
and the spit is this,
he's going by a new cover name now.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.090
Dr. Londes.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.010
-It's a rich bounty.
-It's the Bigfoot of bounties.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.970
Rabbit hole to nowhere. It's a pipe dream.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.933
It's a lead.
With a 90-million Woo price tag.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.435
-Jet, come on. That--
-It doesn't hurt to check it out.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.394
[cell phone beeps]

03:49.854 --> 03:51.147
-You got the info.
-[phone beeps]

03:52.899 --> 03:55.360
And they found Bigfoot, smart guy.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.779
I saw it in a documentary.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.657
No.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.624
[Exclaims]

04:14.295 --> 04:15.296
[Jet] What have you got there?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.757
-Check it out.
-A railgun?

04:17.840 --> 04:18.800
Yeah.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.885
-[chuckles] I hope you kept the receipt.
-What?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.387
Those things are a total scam.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.806
-It's not a scam. [snorts]
-Mm-hmm.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.891
Listen, I'm heading out to grab a part.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.436
While I'm gone, check in on the mechanic,
make sure they're not dicking around.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.604
[Faye] Mm-hmm.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.106
All right.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.359
-It's not a scam!
-[Jet] It is.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.945
What's not a scam?

04:39.779 --> 04:40.780
This bad boy.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.241
[vocalizes]

04:43.324 --> 04:45.451
-Is that a railgun?
-Yeah.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.704
-Total scam.
-It's not a scam.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.832
This thing can shoot a paperclip
through a human skull at 2,000 meters.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.167
Making it the worst gun ever
for a bounty hunter.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.711
[Faye] Not if you shoot him in the foot.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.628
[Spike] Right.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.173
-Where are you going?
-To chase down a pipe dream.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.428
[theme music playing]

06:44.779 --> 06:48.199
[Faye] Hey, I'm supposed to make sure
you're not dicking around.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.786
-Your boss is a proper prick.
-Oh, he's not my boss.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.539
Is that a railgun?

06:55.790 --> 06:58.292
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.463
It's a beast. It shoots metal alloy
using magnetic fields. Cool, right?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.757
I heard they were a total scam.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.802
Why does everybody keep saying that?

07:07.885 --> 07:08.845
[chuckles]

07:08.928 --> 07:10.388
It's not like this iron here.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.557
This is more my speed.

07:13.808 --> 07:14.725
Oh.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.687
That's… Yeah.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.523
May I?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.113
Whenever I see a good-looking piece,
I just have to touch it.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.991
Yeah. Touch away.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.618
[exhales]

07:33.828 --> 07:34.745
Wow.

07:35.955 --> 07:36.956
You shoot her yet?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.792
I haven't found anything small enough

07:39.876 --> 07:41.627
-to fit the chamber.
-To fit the chamber. [chuckles]

07:42.753 --> 07:44.130
Mmm.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.465
It's still very cool.

07:47.967 --> 07:48.968
Thanks.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.889
Well, I should let you get back to work.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.515
I'm about done with her.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.685
I'm waiting for the part
your boyfriend's out scrounging for.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.479
No. Not my boyfriend.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.773
Just a guy
that thinks you're ripping him off.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.609
-[chuckles]
-[scoffs]

08:04.692 --> 08:06.402
Yeah, there's nothing here worth taking.

08:08.946 --> 08:09.989
Except maybe you.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.409
Sorry?

-[TV switches on]
-Well, would you look at that?

09:01.624 --> 09:05.711
Hello, friend, I'm Beatrice.
Welcome to the Londes Center.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.548
Uh, hi. I want to see Dr. Londes.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
And Dr. Londes wants to see you.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.764
We're so happy you're here.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.600
Please, come with me, friend.

09:23.312 --> 09:29.777
At the Londes Center, we are all searchers
on a quest for freedom and harmony.

09:29.860 --> 09:34.115
-Sure, yeah. Where's, uh… Where's Londes?
-Dr. Londes will be with you soon.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.741
But first…

09:38.995 --> 09:41.289
Are you ready to let go, friend?

09:43.624 --> 09:44.625
Let go of what?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.421
Of whatever holds you back
from being your best self.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.221
We all carry ghosts. What's yours, friend?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.599
Regret? Guilt?

09:59.682 --> 10:03.811
-A lost love?
-Gee. [chuckles] Where do I start?

10:08.482 --> 10:12.445
Dr. Londes says your past
is what keeps you from being present.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.906
[Beatrice] Are you ready for your journey
to find your greater self?

10:16.407 --> 10:20.578
-To let go of what ails you?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh, ready to let go.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.413
Wonderful.

10:22.496 --> 10:26.250
Have a seat, friend.
And place the goggles over your eyes.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.086
Uh, I just want to meet Dr. Londes.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.634
And Dr. Londes wants to meet you.
But first, a brief orientation.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.180
-And then Londes?
-Have a seat, friend.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.100
[Spike sighs]

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
[sighs]

10:56.656 --> 11:00.951
[Beatrice] Congratulations, friend.
Dr. Londes awaits you.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.038
But first, let me take you on a journey.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.041
A journey, as Dr. Londes will teach you,

11:07.124 --> 11:10.294
if you free your mind,
the rest will follow.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.505
All right, here we go. Come on, Londes.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.050
[Beatrice] But first,
let us take the next 90 minutes

11:16.133 --> 11:19.053
to examine the origin of our consciousness

11:19.136 --> 11:23.224
as it relates to the primordial animal
unique to each of us.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.935
That'll be bullshit.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
You hiding back there, Londes?

11:30.314 --> 11:32.650
I'm going to free your mind with my foot.

[Julia] Fearless?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.239
[chuckling] Shit.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.326
I found you.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.790
Julia.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.709
Hi.

12:33.002 --> 12:33.836
Hi.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.756
Look at you.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.216
Your hair.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.135
-How did you--
-Ana.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.096
She said you went by to see her.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.848
That you asked about me.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.102
I miss you so much.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.272
I begged Ana to tell me how to find you
so that I could warn you.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.065
Warn me?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.319
They're coming for you. Today.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.196
Vicious?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.657
Not just him. An entire army of them.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.744
You have to run, Fearless.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.622
Run so far they'll never find you.

13:11.123 --> 13:11.957
-Then come with me.
-No.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.377
I didn't come here to be with you.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.797
I came to save you.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.174
I already lost you once,
I'm not losing you again.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.592
I wish things were different.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.845
Nothing's changed between us.
It's just lost time, that's all.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.432
They'll be here any minute.
You have to run.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.350
No.

13:29.850 --> 13:30.935
Fearless…

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
Please.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.522
You have to let me go.

13:35.606 --> 13:36.941
I tried, Julia.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.528
I tried for three years to let you go.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.990
-I can't.
-[gunshot]

14:03.133 --> 14:04.051

All right, Londes.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.711
[chuckles]

16:44.712 --> 16:45.963
-How did you--
-Ana.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.924
She said you went by to see her.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.676
-That you asked about me.
-Asked about you.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.227
You need to tell me
that it's not safe for me here.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.395
Vicious' men…

17:02.646 --> 17:03.647
I know.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.232
How?

17:05.315 --> 17:06.859
I don't know.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.029
But I know that Ana told you
that I was alive.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.573
She told you where to find me.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.369
-Come with me.
-Fearless!

17:17.453 --> 17:19.329
There isn't much time,
they'll be here any moment.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.373
Fearless, I came here--

17:21.457 --> 17:23.834
Only to warn me.
But I'm not leaving here without you.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.295
[beeping]

17:30.090 --> 17:32.009
-You're going to get us both killed.
-I won't.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.470
I know a way off planet.
I've got a friend who can help.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.221
-I just… I need to buy us some time.
-[sighs]

17:37.306 --> 17:39.683
You need to let me go.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.186
You want me to go, I will go.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.438
But only if you can tell me
that you've never thought about me.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.232
That you've never thought about us.
Can you tell me that?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.984
If you can, then I will go.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.616
Come with me,
just one hour, that's all I ask.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.326
Please.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.454
[beeping]

18:03.540 --> 18:04.541
To talk.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.670
Just to talk so you understand
why we can't be together.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.589
I'll take it.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.299
[Julia sighs]

18:12.382 --> 18:14.384
[upbeat music playing]

18:16.220 --> 18:18.180
[engine starts]

19:00.180 --> 19:01.348
[digital beeping]

19:05.394 --> 19:06.395
Spike!

19:08.313 --> 19:09.314
What the hell?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.484
-You okay, buddy?
-Don't do that.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.072
You take off the goggles,
you fry his brain.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.075
-What are you doing to my partner?
-I'm attempting to save him.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.743
Are you Londes?

19:23.203 --> 19:24.037
No.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.208
-Radical Ed sent me an alert.
-Me too.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.586
I'm looking for Londes. Cy-Baba really.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.921
There's a nice piece of change
on his head.

19:33.005 --> 19:33.839
Oh.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.176
-That's a check you'll never cash.
-Huh?

19:37.259 --> 19:40.012
Cy-Baba, there, there is no Cy-Baba.
There never was.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.140
That was a cover story that we cooked up.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.350
Cover story? For what exactly?

19:46.435 --> 19:47.978
An AI I created.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.480
One that went psychotic.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.691
I shut it down immediately.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.986
But not before
thousands of test subjects were killed.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.946
-What's happening to him?
-[sighs]

19:58.030 --> 19:58.906
[Doctor Kaypack] The AI,

19:58.989 --> 20:02.784
it's got him in a VR loop,
attempting to capture his consciousness.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.869
Can you stop it?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.496
Well, once I rewire the system.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.956
-It should--
-Well, keep wiring!

20:08.707 --> 20:09.541
Yeah.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.256
[chuckling]

20:21.678 --> 20:22.679
[Mel] You're kidding.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.350
You're not kidding.

20:28.101 --> 20:28.936
I don't know.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.479
Maybe?

20:31.146 --> 20:32.356
So I was your first?

20:34.983 --> 20:36.818
Okay, yeah. You're the first.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.070
Wow.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.990
[chuckles] First orgasm ever.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.159
Good on me.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.080
At least that I can remember.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.043
Well, if you'd had one before,
trust me, you would have remembered.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.129
Mmm…

20:56.838 --> 20:58.257
No, not exactly.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.554
I had fallout from an epic cryo nap.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.057
Total amnesia.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.102
Everything that happened before I woke,

21:11.645 --> 21:12.479
it's gone.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.608
How long you been awake?

21:19.152 --> 21:20.237
Over two years.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.909
That's still a really long time
to go without having an orgasm.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.663
I'm discovering that.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.499
I don't mean to make light of it.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.168
It can't be easy.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.338
It hasn't been.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.717
You don't know where to turn.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.844
Who to trust.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.973
You have no frame of reference.

21:49.182 --> 21:53.061
The first time you touched a hot kettle,
or skinned your knee.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.023
Because you're already a grown up.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.651
No one to lean on.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.029
No one to be loved by.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.158
I don't know who you were,

22:07.326 --> 22:09.161
and what you forgot,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.332
but I don't think that changes the soul.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.294
And I can see

22:19.212 --> 22:20.505
you've got a really,

22:21.715 --> 22:23.008
really good soul.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.484
[Spike] I was in a bad way.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.904
-So you're a bounty hunter?
-Partnered with an ex-cop no less.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.074
-Took me in. Gave me a roof.
-[line ringing]

22:48.158 --> 22:48.992
Purpose.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.327
[lock beeps, clicks]

22:51.036 --> 22:53.580
Jet. It's me.
Call me the second you get this.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.748
I'll explain then.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.795
Does he know what you used to do?

23:00.670 --> 23:01.671
Who you used to be?

23:03.382 --> 23:04.216
No.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.053
He's probably going to kill me
when he finds out.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.309
But it was inevitable
the truth was going to land one day.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.687
-Fearless.
-It's Spike now.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.523
Spike.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.234
I'm not coming with you.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.822
I can't let you risk losing what you have.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.533
I would risk everything for you.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.955
Julia, I waited for you that night.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.082
But you never came.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.462
I was told you, uh, chose somebody else.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.008
I was afraid.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.177
[Jet] What's it doing to him?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.513
[Doctor Kaypack]
It's exploiting his emotional tether

23:51.596 --> 23:54.558
so it can detach his consciousness
from his neural network.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.269
If the AI can get him
to give up his emotional tether,

23:57.352 --> 23:59.020
then it'll devour his consciousness.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.230
And then what?

24:00.313 --> 24:03.483
If that happens, he's game over.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.822
I could have kept us safe.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.449
You couldn't.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.951
Not then and not now.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.705
-Jet's going to get my message--
-You have to go.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.207
[beeping]

24:20.208 --> 24:21.460
You have to leave me.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.211
Forget me.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.339
It's the only way you'll ever be safe.

24:26.923 --> 24:27.924
Forget you?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.052
That's not going to happen.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.144
Hey! Hey! The numbers are going down.
That's good, right?

24:39.227 --> 24:43.315
Yeah, the longer he fights back,
the longer we have to shut it down.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.533
[Spike sighs]

24:53.617 --> 24:55.285
I'm not losing you again, Julia.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.500
I've traveled all across the solar system
and I have never,

25:02.334 --> 25:05.212
ever found anyone
who makes me feel the way that you do.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.422
[chuckles]

25:07.506 --> 25:09.049
[beeping]

25:10.884 --> 25:13.178
Then Vicious will hunt us down,

25:13.929 --> 25:14.930
he'll kill us.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.806
That will not change.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.892
He's a psychopath.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.270
You'll never be safe with him.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.567
Let me protect you.

-I can't shut it down from here.

25:35.283 --> 25:36.826
You'll have to cut the power
from the mainframe.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.911
Where's the mainframe?

25:38.787 --> 25:40.580
-Earth.
-Fucking Earth?

25:40.664 --> 25:41.790
Pick up, pick up!

-[horn honks]

25:44.626 --> 25:45.544
Come on.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.338
No. You have to go without me.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.967
I tried, God damn it.
I tried for three years to let you go.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.802
But I can't.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.012
[groans]

26:00.475 --> 26:01.601
You killed me.

[upbeat music playing]

26:26.251 --> 26:27.127

26:34.884 --> 26:37.178
-Julia.
-Fearless?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.639
We have to get out of here,
there's no time.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.142
-But--
-I know, you came here to warn me.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.019
We have to go. Now.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.520
Fearless, I can't.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.155
What the fuck?

26:56.156 --> 26:57.657
Oh, my God! Do you knock?

Just get that new coil installed.

-Hey, can we turn on the sprinkler system?
-Yes, yes, we can.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.227
If I re-route the coolant line.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.312
[alarm beeping]

30:57.313 --> 30:58.982
[grunts]

31:01.067 --> 31:02.110
Okay, now!

31:20.753 --> 31:22.755
Vicious isn't the villain, you are.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.049
You never loved me.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.427
You just loved
taking your best friend's girl.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.304
And now you're going to get me killed.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.557
Brace for impact.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.060
[both scream]

31:41.816 --> 31:42.775
[laughs in relief]

31:50.533 --> 31:52.577
I don't love you.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.788
I could never love a monster like you.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.876
[groans, screams]

32:02.712 --> 32:05.423
You've got to hurry. 92% and rising.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.717
[Jet] Wait. I see it!

32:07.800 --> 32:10.470
He's giving up his tether. He's dying.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.263
[Jet] No, he's not! What do I do?

32:12.347 --> 32:14.015
[Doctor Kaypack] Cut the power source.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.392
There's a panel
in the back of the mainframe.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.478
-[Faye] It's, it's completely sealed up.
-[growls]

32:18.561 --> 32:19.479
[Faye] There's no way to get in.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.564
[Jet] Stand back!

32:28.029 --> 32:29.447
[beeping]

32:29.530 --> 32:33.326
Who are you kidding?
Everything you touch, dies.

32:36.871 --> 32:37.914
Damn it.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.624
[Faye] Shoot!

32:39.707 --> 32:40.667
[grunts]

32:40.750 --> 32:42.627
[Mel] There's got to be something
around here.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.214
So for once in your life,
do something right.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.968
[grunting]

32:50.051 --> 32:50.885
[Mel] Hey, hey.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.595
Will this work?

32:59.686 --> 33:02.689
And just let me go.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.023
[Jet grunting]

33:08.152 --> 33:09.278
[gunshot]

33:14.534 --> 33:15.368
Okay.

33:18.871 --> 33:19.914
I'll go.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.467
[beeping]

33:37.724 --> 33:38.558
[beeps off]

33:39.350 --> 33:41.352
[instrumental music playing]

33:45.982 --> 33:47.608
[gasps]

33:49.027 --> 33:50.194
[Jet] Doc! Talk to me.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.363
He's okay. He's alive.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.407
-[laughs]
-[Mel] Oh, my God.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.616
-Yes, yes, yes!
-[Mel] Oh, my God.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.701
[screams, laughs]

34:02.874 --> 34:03.916
[groans]

34:11.299 --> 34:13.134
[hissing]

34:13.217 --> 34:15.428
[object clinking]

34:20.016 --> 34:21.184
[groans softly]

34:30.318 --> 34:31.569
[Jet] Good. You're awake?

34:34.530 --> 34:36.949
Too loud. Too loud.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.035
[Jet] What, your head hurt?

34:40.828 --> 34:41.704
[groans]

34:42.789 --> 34:44.040
My hair hurts.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.250
[Jet laughs]

34:48.461 --> 34:50.171
-[thuds]
-[exhales]

34:57.428 --> 34:59.222
Did we at least find Londes?

34:59.305 --> 35:02.141
Nah, not in a way that gets us paid.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.106
-[Spike groans]
-[Jet] There he is.

35:09.023 --> 35:12.235
Bigfoot revealed.
We pulled that off the mainframe.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.486
I don't get it.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.114
What does the first letter
of every word spell?

35:18.449 --> 35:22.161
-L-O-N-D-E-S.
-Yeah.

35:22.245 --> 35:27.291
Kaypack thinks that the AI restarted
itself and created the Dr. Londes identity

35:27.375 --> 35:29.544
to lure people in.
And before you say anything, just--

35:29.627 --> 35:31.796
I told you that lead was horse hockey.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.965
And you're right. I admit it.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.343
When I find
that son of a bitch Radical Ed,

35:37.426 --> 35:38.636
I'm going to rip off his fingers.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.265
One by one. Nice and slow.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.059
-Good luck with that. [grunts]
-Yeah.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.270
I am going to

35:48.354 --> 35:51.983
[straining] go back to bed.
For the next 17 days.

35:52.066 --> 35:52.900
[Jet] Hey.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.194
I'm glad you're okay.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.530
Yeah.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.492
-Me too.
-So…

36:03.327 --> 36:06.122
Those goggle things,
what did you see in there, anyway?

36:09.458 --> 36:10.918
I don't remember.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.379
Hmm.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.299
[smooth jazz music playing]

36:23.514 --> 36:26.350
So, you're just gonna zip and dip.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.645
[chuckles] Well, you know.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.607
-Unless we're moving in together.
-We're not?

36:33.441 --> 36:35.860
You're cute. Very cute.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.989
-Can I call you some time?
-Yeah.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.410
But first you've got to figure out
who the real you is.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.585
-Hey.
-Mm.

36:54.670 --> 36:55.504
Take it.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.758
It's a terrible gun
for a bounty hunter, anyway.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.510
Something to remember me by.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.643
She's yours whenever you want her back.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.814
See you, Faye Valentine.

37:40.091 --> 37:40.925
Okay.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.053
I'll go.

37:45.888 --> 37:47.014
But not without you.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.169
[melancholy jazz music playing]

38:29.724 --> 38:31.225
I'll never let you go.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.822
[rock music playing]
