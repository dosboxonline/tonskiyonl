11:59.844 --> 12:01.887
Seeing how you're throwing money around.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.431
New apartment. New car.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.224
Ninja-level gaming station.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.811
Oh, I wish. Ninja's setup is just beyond.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.691
And my finances
are between me and TurboTax.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.819
You know what I think?
I think you lied about Kreese.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.822
Silver paid you to do it
so he could have Cobra Kai to himself.

12:19.905 --> 12:24.285
[scoffs] That's… I don't know how you…
You gotta really leap to--

12:24.368 --> 12:27.413
Why would someone
leave this in my mailbox?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.374
Uh, look, I…

12:30.458 --> 12:34.712
No. You know what? I don't know why
someone left that in your mailbox. Okay?

12:34.795 --> 12:38.132
A-All I know is that Sensei Silver
is an honorable man.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.633
He felt terrible for what happened.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.012
Sensei Silver came after my family.
That's the kind of man he is.

12:43.095 --> 12:48.142
Well, if that is true, then you must have
done something to deserve it.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.686
You're gonna give me
a goddamn straight answer!

12:52.772 --> 12:54.231
[Stingray] Oh no.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.651
[groans] My PlayStation.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.238
-Who gives a shit about your PlayStation?
-Daniel-san. Enough.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.365
You are not yourself.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.868
[speaks Japanese]

13:05.951 --> 13:07.912
[somber music plays]

13:14.335 --> 13:16.587
-He's obviously full of shit.
-[Chozen] Hai.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.380
He's also no stingray.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.673
He is turtle.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.468
If pressed,
he will retreat further into shell.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.514
You're right. He's bought and paid for.
This guy's never gonna help us.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.556
Mmm.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.642
[breathes deeply]

13:30.518 --> 13:31.894
But I know someone who can.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.647
[tense music crescendos]

13:35.648 --> 13:36.565
[rock music plays]

13:36.649 --> 13:39.819
-[Jessica] Oh.
-Oh, wow. This place never changes.

13:39.902 --> 13:44.323
You literally say that every time.
Oh, check it out! Vintage.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.743
Right, yeah. They're, um,
remaking old stuff from the '80s.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.204
[laughs] Sweet, sweet boy.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.248
This is no cheap remake.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.624
That's the original.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.628
Your mom used to play it for hours.
Till she got into underage drinking.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.089
She even had top score at one point.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.258
Who knows? She might even still have it.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.052
Only way to find out
is to get on that leaderboard.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.720
[Anthony] Sure, yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.639
How hard can it be?

14:09.139 --> 14:11.141
[rock music continues]

14:13.853 --> 14:16.480
Okay. What's new? Catch me up.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.399
Oh, same ol', same ol'.

14:18.482 --> 14:23.028
Just got back from climbing in the Gorge.
The girls are both working out that way.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.198
But we didn't siphon off the kids
to talk about me.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.243
What's the real reason
Daniel didn't make the trip?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.370
So you saw through that one, did ya?

14:31.453 --> 14:33.372
[woman] Jessica Andrews!

14:34.373 --> 14:35.833
I see you, girl.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.126
Oh God.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.088
Hey. [chuckles awkwardly]

14:41.171 --> 14:42.089
Christ sakes.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.426
Amanda Steiner.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.677
Hey, Lizzie-Anne.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.889
Remember she beat up that car
with the baseball bat?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.683
What was that nickname
that we gave you after that?

14:52.766 --> 14:54.018
God, it was so good.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.354
Good God, I wish I could remember,
you know. It was so long ago.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.857
We're gonna catch up. It was a good talk.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.192
Yeah.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.361
Uh-huh.

15:05.070 --> 15:05.946
Have fun.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.078
I commit one act of vehicular vandalism.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.373
Never mind the middle-aged mean girls
with faded lower back tattoos.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.543
Spill the beans.
What's going on with you and Daniel?

15:19.627 --> 15:22.671
I guess it all started
when he got back into karate.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.217
[knocking on door]

15:28.010 --> 15:29.762
You have to open it from out there.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.767
-Hey.
-[Johnny] LaRusso?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.520
-Oh, you look like shit.
-[Daniel] I need your help.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.565
I think Silver paid Stingray
to lie about Kreese's attack.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.069
-He's driving your old Cobra Kai mobile.
-What?

15:45.152 --> 15:48.197
He joined Cobra Kai
back when it was still your dojo, right?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.241
You get him to flip,
we might take Silver down for good.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.912
-Time to get back in the game.
-Sorry. I'm dealing with family stuff.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.374
I washed my hands of Cobra Kai
when we lost the tournament.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.293
What? Y-You started
the whole Cobra Kai thing.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.253
If you hadn't,
none of this would be happening.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.631
You opened Pandora's Box, not me.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.134
Listen, I don't know
who Pandora is or what's in her box,

16:09.218 --> 16:11.762
but I got Robby out of there
and Kreese is in jail.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.890
That's two wins as far as I'm concerned.
Best to leave well enough alone.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.392
What about the other kids?

16:16.475 --> 16:19.728
And since when
do you ever leave well enough alone?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.522
What happened
to the "strike first badass"?

16:21.605 --> 16:23.399
Do I need to kick his ass to wake him up

16:23.482 --> 16:27.069
or was just one tournament loss
all it took to turn you into a pussy?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.529
[tense music plays]

16:32.241 --> 16:34.118
[tense music crescendos]

16:35.160 --> 16:36.120
What are you doing?

16:36.704 --> 16:40.541
You show up out of the blue,
raving like a lunatic, you reek of booze,

16:40.624 --> 16:42.084
and now you wanna fight me

16:42.167 --> 16:44.586
'cause I don't wanna get pulled
back into this rivalry?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.549
What's going on with you?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.385
[sighs]

16:51.969 --> 16:53.971
[calm music plays]

16:54.680 --> 16:56.015
What the hell am I doing?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.267
[sighs]

16:59.685 --> 17:01.311
If you think I'm off the rails…

17:01.812 --> 17:04.440
Way off. Look at ya.
Your shirt's not even tucked in.

17:05.024 --> 17:05.858
[sighs]

17:07.526 --> 17:09.903
Amanda let you leave the house like that?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.489
She wasn't there to stop me.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.160
Finally pushed her past her limit.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.329
She's at her mother's in Ohio.
She took the kids with her.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.842
Damn it. The space lobsters
have tractor beams?

17:31.925 --> 17:33.177
This game is bullshit.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.387
Is this you?

17:36.221 --> 17:37.556
-[boy shouts]
-[Kenny grunts]

17:37.639 --> 17:39.141
[boy] Oh!

17:39.224 --> 17:40.642
[laughter]

17:40.726 --> 17:42.144
[Sam] This went Valley-viral.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.771
I was there. Why didn't you get me?

17:43.854 --> 17:47.316
I don't know. Something tells me
getting my sister to beat up my bully

17:47.399 --> 17:50.486
was not the best solution long-term.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.280
And besides, I, uh… I kind of deserved it.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.364
Your bully?

17:55.949 --> 17:57.409
How long has this been going on?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.414
Apparently, there is no end.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.208
Whoa, that is a lot.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.709
Every time I think it's over,

18:05.793 --> 18:10.506
another enemy emerges from Daniel's past
like some twisted game of whack-a-mole.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.800
His latest one, Terry Silver?

18:12.883 --> 18:14.968
-He was hosting a charity--
-[chokes] Sorry.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.847
Terry Silver is back?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.557
You know Terry Silver?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.725
How?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.813
Um, okay, when I…

18:26.313 --> 18:27.773
When I met Daniel,

18:27.856 --> 18:30.984
he was going through some things,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.695
and Silver was the cause.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.825
-You never thought of mentioning it?
-I never thought he would come back.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.952
By the time you were moving to LA

18:40.035 --> 18:43.789
and I put you in touch with Daniel,
he was way past all of that.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.291
Silver did a real number
on Daniel back then.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.254
-Yeah, I've heard the headlines.
-I'm not sure the headlines do it justice.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.049
-[tense music plays]
-[Jessica] He pretended to be his friend.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.970
-Then his mentor.
-[young Daniel] Hey, come on--

18:58.053 --> 19:01.598
[Jessica] While his goons
wrecked his Bonsai shop, beat him up.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.226
They assaulted me.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.896
They terrorized Daniel
at every opportunity.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.231
[tense music continues]

19:09.815 --> 19:13.193
All to drive a wedge
between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.361
And it worked.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.447
At least for a while.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.076
-I didn't know it got so intense.
-[Jessica] Yeah.

19:21.827 --> 19:26.498
But he got past it back then,
so he can get past it now, right?

19:26.582 --> 19:30.586
Yeah. Except he didn't really
get past it then, did he?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.674
I left her a bunch
of bourbon-soaked messages last night,

19:35.757 --> 19:37.843
but she hasn't called me back yet.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.642
We both know I'm not the guy
you come to for advice on this stuff.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.022
Family's never been my strong suit.
But it is yours.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.608
Always annoyed me.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.988
I'm sure you and Amanda have your hiccups,
but you always get over 'em.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.742
No reason to think
you're not gonna get through this,

20:01.825 --> 20:03.619
as long as you keep your head
out of your ass.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.374
That's… a valid point.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.087
Do I wanna ask what's going on here or…

20:14.838 --> 20:18.175
Robby moved in. Him and Miguel
are at each other's throats again.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.427
This is my dumb idea
to get them to iron it out.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.637
It crashed and burned.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.600
[chuckles] So much for "Goggle's" advice
on conflict resolution.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.313
Hmm. Surprised you know how to "goggle,"
or the phrase "conflict resolution."

20:34.233 --> 20:38.737
Obviously, you care a lot about them both,
so I have a pretty good feeling

20:39.696 --> 20:41.156
you're gonna work it out too.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.202
Whether it be with the computer savvy,
new Johnny approach

20:45.285 --> 20:48.664
or something a little more…
Johnny Classic.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.332
Johnny Classic, huh?

20:51.917 --> 20:56.463
-I didn't think you were a fan of his.
-Yeah, well, he's starting to grow on me.

20:57.422 --> 21:00.050
Tell anyone I said that,
we really are gonna fight again.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.468
I'm not talking tournament rules.

21:03.303 --> 21:06.723
Maybe that's how we should have done it
all those years ago.

21:06.807 --> 21:11.061
If we hadn't had to stop at three points,
we might've got this out of our systems.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.730
I might have.
Three points is all you had in you.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.648
[laughs]

21:16.525 --> 21:17.609
There he is.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.570
All right. On that note,

21:21.405 --> 21:23.573
thanks for the banquet. [sighs]

21:23.657 --> 21:24.992
And, um…

21:26.285 --> 21:27.619
And the perspective.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.663
That's what I'm here for.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.331
All right.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.417
[gentle music plays]

21:37.504 --> 21:38.922
[gentle music fades]

21:39.006 --> 21:43.677
So I tried to apologize at the tournament,
but, you know, I just pissed him off more.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.804
-If Robby didn't show up--
-Robby?

21:45.887 --> 21:50.892
He came in as I was getting my ass kicked,
and stopped it from getting kicked worse.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.937
I'm starting to see
why Dad hates Cobra Kai.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.983
Oh my God. Babe Ruthless!

22:00.902 --> 22:02.112
Babe Ruthless.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.114
That's what we used to call you.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.492
That's right.
Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.036
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

22:09.119 --> 22:13.123
Does Miss Coastal Elite not like
to be reminded of where she came from?

22:13.206 --> 22:15.250
-Blow it out your ass, Rooney.
-[Amanda giggles]

22:15.751 --> 22:18.253
Why don't you make me, Andrews?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.091
Oh, look at the tough chick.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.094
[Jessica] You need to back off, Elizabeth.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.096
Oh yeah? Or what?

22:28.180 --> 22:31.350
-Keep it up and you'll find out.
-Stay in your lane, Steiner.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.935
This is a bar, not a yoga class.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.980
So unless you've got a bat
hiding behind that bony butt--

22:37.064 --> 22:39.274
I don't need a bat for you, tramp stamp.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.818
-[grunting]
-[glass smashing]

22:42.611 --> 22:45.489
[grunting]

22:46.198 --> 22:47.491
[grunting]

22:48.116 --> 22:50.452
[Amanda] Let go of me! [strains]

22:53.538 --> 22:56.541
-You asked for it, bitch.
-[Amanda gasps]

22:57.584 --> 22:58.543
[Sam grunts]

22:59.711 --> 23:01.922
-[Amanda] Holy shit!
-[dramatic music plays]

23:02.631 --> 23:03.924
-Go!
-Where? Where?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.513
[music fades]

23:10.347 --> 23:11.723
[Daniel] You almost packed?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.935
Daniel-san, we must not give up.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.479
I understand how you feel.

23:17.562 --> 23:21.358
As much as I can't stomach
the thought of letting Silver win,

23:22.776 --> 23:24.820
it's not worth losing my family over.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.114
Nothing is.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.242
I have failed you.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.910
[sighs] No.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.662
[emotional music plays]

23:33.745 --> 23:34.621
The opposite.

23:36.039 --> 23:40.001
You have gone above and beyond.
Any failures were mine alone.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.506
I'm only sorry I wasted your time.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.677
Defending honor of Miyagi-Do

23:49.302 --> 23:50.846
never a waste of time.

I won't be able to sleep tonight
unless I make amends with Raymond.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.407
I'm gonna go take care of that
while you finish packing.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.408
Hmm.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.326
Then we'll head to the airport.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.788
Maybe start planning
a LaRusso family trip to come visit you.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.959
Assuming I can make amends
with them too. [sighs]

24:21.835 --> 24:23.753
I know you will, Daniel-san.

-Mind your business. Beat it.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.398
-Stay put.
-Are you kidding?

-I don't know how many times--
-Quiet!

You wanna hang on to your grudge? Fine.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.449
At least be men about it.
Put your fists where your mouths are.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.243
You want us to do what?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.120
Fight it out.

[dramatic music continues]

24:58.914 --> 25:00.332
No points. No mats.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.502

out of your systems.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.878
What, here? Now?

25:06.254 --> 25:07.714
It's a time, this is a place.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.675
Unless that was just talk?

25:11.468 --> 25:12.302
Not for me.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.430
Or me.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.308
All right. Let's get on with it.

[both breathing heavily]

27:30.440 --> 27:31.775
Why'd you hold back?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.903
I didn't get into karate to hurt people.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.782
I did it to be a badass and find balance.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.618
Yeah, I understand that.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.373
Last time we fought like this,
uh, how come you didn't hold back?

27:47.457 --> 27:48.875
I wanted to finish the fight.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.087
I mean, not like that. I just… I…

27:52.671 --> 27:55.340
I had tunnel vision
and I got so angry that I just…

27:55.924 --> 27:57.842
I mean, I barely knew where we were.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.637
I'd take it back in a second if I could.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.057
I was the cause
of the worst moment in your life.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.770
If it's any consolation,
it was the worst moment in my life too.

28:10.271 --> 28:12.273
[gentle music plays]

28:13.316 --> 28:14.526
Yeah, I'll take it.

[Johnny] So?

28:17.195 --> 28:18.029
Is it over?

Are you guys good?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.158
[gentle music continues]

28:22.242 --> 28:25.161
Thank God. If you still hated each other
when the baby gets here…

[gentle music stops]

28:27.706 --> 28:28.540
The baby?

28:29.541 --> 28:30.458
Wait, what?

28:31.042 --> 28:32.127
You and my mom?

28:32.210 --> 28:35.296
[sighs] Yeah, we're, uh, having a baby.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.258
We were supposed to tell you together,
so act surprised.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.468
-Holy shit!
-Yeah, like that.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.554
Dad, that's… That's awesome.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.305
That's awesome.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.391
[upbeat music plays]

28:48.435 --> 28:52.147
That was like an action movie.
You were like Jean-Claude Van Sam.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.982
[giggles] I can teach you if you want.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.985
-I thought you were done with karate?
-[Sam] Yeah, me too.

28:57.986 --> 29:02.157
I don't know. I guess I just… wanted
things to go back to the way they were

29:02.240 --> 29:04.325
before karate overtook everything.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.330
But the reality is there'll always be
assholes and bullies in the world.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.459
Sometimes it's nice
to know how to fight back against them.

29:17.046 --> 29:23.011
I know chores aren't really your thing,
but we could fast-forward past them.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.556
-Don't tell Dad.
-No problem. Been lying to him for years.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.099

29:28.183 --> 29:31.269
[Jessica] A couple of good eggs there.
But Sam?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.146
Woo! Girl's got skills.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.483
-It's in her blood, I guess.
-[Jessica] I'll say.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.111
So is, uh, protecting her loved ones.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.031
That one she gets from the both of you.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.868
Mm-hmm. And the larger point
you're clearly trying to make is?

29:48.244 --> 29:49.871
We just got into a bar fight.

29:49.954 --> 29:53.124
-[both laugh]
-Over nothing. Okay?

29:53.208 --> 29:54.250
[giggles]

29:54.751 --> 29:56.628
Daniel, on the other hand,

29:57.462 --> 29:58.755
has every reason

29:59.255 --> 30:01.841
to hate Terry Silver
after what he put him through.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.303
I still have nightmares myself sometimes.

30:06.262 --> 30:09.849
So you're saying
I should cut him some slack?

30:09.933 --> 30:12.727
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.065
[Johnny] All right. Dig in.

Wow. You weren't kidding
about these breadsticks, Dad.

30:23.988 --> 30:28.034
I wouldn't lie to you.
Three times in the same day.

-Hi.
-Hi, Ms. Diaz.

I hope it's cool I'm here.

It's very cool.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.015
These guys are getting along now?
How did you manage that?

30:52.141 --> 30:56.229
Don't tell me the bruises on their faces
mean you beat them into submission?

30:56.312 --> 30:59.190
No, of course not.
They beat each other into submission.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.110
Don't worry. It was all supervised.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.445
It was actually LaRusso's idea.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.866
I didn't know you and Daniel
were working together again.

31:07.949 --> 31:08.950
We weren't.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.121
But I think we might need to.

Hello?

I left you a message. I, um…

I got you a new PlayStation.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.187
Hello?

to turn on me?

you wanna surrender?

I'm becoming someone I don't wanna be.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.795
I'm hiding the truth
from someone I care about.
