WEBVTT

00:55.013 --> 00:56.264
There it is.

00:56.432 --> 00:59.434
My house
at good old Cleveland Street.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.811
How could I ever forget it?

01:01.979 --> 01:04.688
And there I am,
with that dumb, round face...

01:04.857 --> 01:07.817
. . .and that stupid stocking cap.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.778
But no matter.
Christmas was on its way.

01:10.946 --> 01:17.452
Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas,
around which the entire kid year revolved.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.936
Downtown Hohman was prepared
for its yearly bacchanalia. . .

01:44.104 --> 01:47.356
. . .of peace on Earth
and goodwill to men.

02:36.949 --> 02:40.660
Higbees' corner window
was traditionally a high-water mark. . .

02:40.828 --> 02:43.830
...of the pre-Christmas season.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.958
First-nighters,
packed earmuff to earmuff. . .

02:47.125 --> 02:52.338
. . .jostled in wonderment
before a golden, tinkling display. . .

02:52.506 --> 02:57.593
. . .of mechanized, electronic joy.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.972
There it is.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.308
The holy grail of Christmas gifts.

03:45.475 --> 03:50.396
The Red Ryder 200-shot range
model air rifle.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.982
And there he is.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.151
Red Ryder himself.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.486
In his hand was the knurled stock. . .

03:57.654 --> 04:04.160
. . .of as coolly, deadly looking a piece
of weaponry as ever I had laid eyes on.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.208
For weeks, I had been scheming
to get my mitts. . .

04:11.376 --> 04:15.171
. . .on one of these fearsome
blue-steel beauties.

04:15.339 --> 04:19.175
My fevered brain seethed
with the effort of trying to come up...

04:19.343 --> 04:22.637
...with the infinitely
subtle devices necessary...

04:22.804 --> 04:26.849
...to implant the Red Ryder
range model air rifle indelibly...

04:27.017 --> 04:29.393
. . .into my parents' subconscious.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.146
Ralphie! Randy!

04:32.314 --> 04:34.315
Down here in two minutes.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.359
And I mean two minutes.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.321
Come on, Ralphie! I got here first!

04:45.243 --> 04:47.036
Cut it out.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.731
My mother, grabbing for her copy
of Look magazine...

05:15.899 --> 05:21.153
...would find herself cleverly trapped
into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.117
They traded Bullfrog.
I don't believe it.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.576
What's that?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.329
Well, for chrissakes,
the Sox traded Bullfrog. . .

05:30.497 --> 05:32.748
. . .the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.584
Four Eyes Shottenhoffer,
utility infielder.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.838
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.256
That's nice.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.467
Ralphie, on the double!

05:44.094 --> 05:46.345
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?

05:46.513 --> 05:47.888
Swallowed a yo-yo?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.265
Yeah, on a bet.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.518
Some clodhopper
down in Griffith, Indiana.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.022
Boy, they write the silliest things
in the newspapers.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.440
What do you mean silly?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.816
I mean, that's real news.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.902
That's not like that politics slop.

06:02.070 --> 06:07.283
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

06:07.451 --> 06:09.452
Victor. His name is Victor.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.037
How the hell did you know that?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
Everybody knows that.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.959
Is that another
one of your silly puzzles?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.295
Yeah, it's another
one of my silly puzzles.

06:19.463 --> 06:23.883
Could be worth 50,000 bucks.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.010
What kind is it this time?

06:26.178 --> 06:29.555
Name the great characters
in American literature.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.348
-Victor?
-Yeah.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.768
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?

06:33.935 --> 06:37.104
Meanwhile, I struggled
for exactly the right BB gun hint.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.647
It had to be firm, but subtle.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.984
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.952
They looked at me as if
I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.999
I could tell I was in imminent danger
of overplaying my hand.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.710
Casually, I switched tactics.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.378
Hey, Dad.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.132
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got for you for Christmas.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.594
A new furnace.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.806
That's a good one, Dad.

07:13.266 --> 07:18.687
My old man was one of the most feared
furnace fighters in Northern Indiana.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.524
Hurry up,
you're gonna be late for school.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.026
Yeah, yeah. I'm running late already.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.487
Round one was over.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.282
Parents, one. Kids, zip.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.577
I could feel the Christmas noose
beginning to tighten.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.539
Maybe what happened next
was inevitable.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.291
Ralphie,
what would you like for Christmas?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.627
Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.

07:41.795 --> 07:46.382
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine action 200-range model air rifle.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.135
No. Shoot your eye out.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.888
Oh, no, it was the classic
mother BB gun block:

07:53.223 --> 07:54.974
"You'll shoot your eye out."

07:55.142 --> 07:57.935
That deadly phrase
uttered many times before...

07:58.103 --> 08:00.688
...by hundreds of mothers
was not surmountable. . .

08:00.856 --> 08:02.815
...by any means known to Kid-dom.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.944
But such was my mania,
my desire for a Red Ryder carbine. . .

08:07.112 --> 08:11.198
. . .that I immediately began
to rebuild the dike.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.741
I was just kidding.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.910
Even though Flick is getting one.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.871
I guess I'd just like some Tinkertoys.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.123
I couldn't believe my own ears.
Tinkertoys?

08:19.291 --> 08:20.833
She'd never buy it.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.960
BB guns are dangerous.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.795
I don't want anybody
shooting his eye out.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.052
Randy, will you eat?

08:32.220 --> 08:35.054
There are starving people in China.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.400
Mothers know nothing
about creeping marauders. . .

08:46.568 --> 08:48.903
. . .burrowing through the snow
toward the kitchen. . .

08:49.070 --> 08:50.654
. . .where only you and you alone...

08:50.822 --> 08:55.618
...stand between your tiny,
huddled family and insensate evil.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.623
Save us.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.126
Save us, Ralphie.

09:04.294 --> 09:09.423
I just knowed those bad guys
would be coming for us in the end.

09:09.591 --> 09:13.052
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got Ol' Blue.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.974
Well, now,
what have we got here, folks?

09:19.142 --> 09:22.228
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.106
Well, just me and my trusty
old Red Ryder carbine action. . .

09:26.274 --> 09:28.651
. . .200-shot range model air rifle.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.487
Lucky I got a compass in the stock.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.032
-Well, I think I better have a look here.
-Don't worry, son.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.882
-Oh, no, it's Ol' Blue.
-Ol' Blue.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.926
Oh, no.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.680
Seize him, boys! The jig is up!

10:08.108 --> 10:10.693
Killed another one.
Oh, he's a deadeye, ain't he?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.782
He's getting him.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.119
Okay, Ralphie.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.790
You win this time, but we'll be back.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.462
AdiÃ³s, Bart.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.049
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.141
-And don't you forget it.
-Well, son, you saved us.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.559
We were goners for sure.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.102
And you saved us.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.604
Hallelujah!

10:47.772 --> 10:50.232
Go on ! Beat it!

10:52.277 --> 10:57.698
The Olds. Nothing but Oldsmobile.
That pile of junk.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.451
That goddamned Olds
has froze up again.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.078
Some men are Baptists,
others Catholics.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.581
My father was an Oldsmobile man.

11:05.749 --> 11:10.127
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the equator.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.672
-Little pitchers.
-And hold it!

11:26.394 --> 11:29.605
It's a clinker!

11:29.773 --> 11:31.815
That blasted stupid furnace.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.109
Goddamn it.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.699
Damn skates.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.953
Oh, for chrissake,
open up the damper, will you?

11:45.121 --> 11:48.248
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?!

11:48.416 --> 11:50.542
Oh, blast it!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.961
Blurred rattle crash camel flirt!

11:53.129 --> 11:56.632
You block-head battled piece
jerk off trash !

11:59.302 --> 12:04.306
In the heat of battle, my father
wove a tapestry of obscenity. . .

12:04.474 --> 12:05.808
. . .that, as far as we know...

12:05.975 --> 12:08.769
. . .is still hanging in space
over Lake Michigan.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.775
Gollywop-dopter-crop-dop-
fratenhouse-stickelfeiffer!

12:19.864 --> 12:21.865
Well, preparing to go to school...

12:22.033 --> 12:25.035
. . .was like getting ready
for extended deep-sea diving.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.390
Come on, Mom, we're gonna be late.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.350
All right, Ralph.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.271
My kid brother
looked like a tick about to pop.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.064
What?

12:54.441 --> 12:57.818
What is it?

13:02.031 --> 13:05.868
-What is it?
-I can't put my arms down.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.548
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.

13:23.678 --> 13:29.183
Goddamn it! You. . . .

13:49.329 --> 13:51.914
Hey, Flick, wait up. Wait up.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.999
So, what are you doing?

13:54.167 --> 13:57.002
What does it look like I'm doing,
picking goobers?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.754
Hey, listen, smartass.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.799
I asked my old man about sticking
your tongue to metal light poles in winter.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.428
And he says it will freeze
right to the pole, just like I told you.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.389
Baloney. What would your old man
know about anything?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.225
He knows
because he once saw a guy. . .

14:11.392 --> 14:13.936
. . .stick his tongue
to a railroad track on a bet.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.606
And the fire department had to come
to get the guy's tongue off the track.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.399
Because he couldn't get it off.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.401
Come on, guys, wait up!

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
Come on, guys!

14:23.404 --> 14:26.990
-Come on, guys, wait up.
-Out of the way, kid.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.493
Hey, kid.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.579
I can't get up.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
I can't get up!

14:35.416 --> 14:37.626
Ralph ! Hey!

14:37.794 --> 14:41.380
I can't get up, Ralphie!

14:41.548 --> 14:43.131
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.093
I can't get up!

14:46.261 --> 14:48.428
Ralph ! Hey!

14:48.596 --> 14:51.848
-Come on, get up. Sit up. Come on.
-I can't get up.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.187
You're okay. Come on, let's go.
Come on, you're all right.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.945
Miss Shields.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.364
Miss Shields, Miss Shields.

15:07.532 --> 15:11.285
All right, everyone,
take your seats, please.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.252
Good morning, class.

15:20.420 --> 15:24.298
Good morning, Miss Shields.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.834
Open your books to page 32.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.338
And as you'll remember,
Silas Marner--

16:14.515 --> 16:16.558
You're full of beans
and so is your old man.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.934
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah !

16:18.102 --> 16:19.436
-Says who?
-Says me.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.854
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah !

16:21.022 --> 16:22.564
Well, I double-dare you.

16:22.732 --> 16:28.278
The exact exchange and nuance
of phrase in this ritual is very important.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.696
Are you kidding?

16:29.864 --> 16:32.282
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?
That's dumb.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.409
That's because you know it will stick.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.411
-You're full of it.
-Oh, yeah?

16:36.579 --> 16:39.081
-Yeah.
-Well, I double-dog dare you !

16:39.666 --> 16:43.210
Now it was serious.
A double-dog dare.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.253
What else was left
but a triple dare you?

16:45.421 --> 16:47.881
And finally, the coup de grÃ¢ce
of all dares:

16:48.049 --> 16:50.759
-The sinister triple-dog dare.
-You guys are really dumb.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.179
I triple-dog dare you !

16:54.722 --> 16:57.057
Schwartz created a slight breach
of etiquette...

16:57.225 --> 17:00.644
. . .by skipping the triple dare
and going right for the throat.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.063
All right, all right.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.273
Come on, kid.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.949
Well, go on, smartass, and do it.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.784
I'm going, I'm going.

17:15.952 --> 17:20.079
Flick's spine stiffened,
his lips curled in a defiant sneer.

17:20.248 --> 17:23.541
There was no going back now.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.587
This is no--

17:31.634 --> 17:34.136
Stuck? Stuck? Stuck!

17:34.303 --> 17:37.556
Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!

17:37.724 --> 17:39.433
Stuck!

17:40.977 --> 17:43.603
-Stuck! Stuck!
-Geez. It really works.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.064
-Look at him.
-It's stuck!

17:47.024 --> 17:48.650
Hey, what have I done?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.451
Don't leave, come back.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.912
-Come back. Don't leave me. Come back.
-But the bell rang.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.330
What are we gonna do?!

18:02.498 --> 18:04.833
-I don't know. The bell rang.
-Yeah.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.295
Hey, don't leave me. Come back!

18:08.463 --> 18:11.339
Come back! Come back.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.219
Where's Flick?

18:17.638 --> 18:19.014
Has anyone seen Flick?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.807
Flick? Flick who?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.643
He was at recess, wasn't he?

18:24.812 --> 18:28.023
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?

18:32.820 --> 18:37.699
I said, has anyone seen Flick?

18:38.701 --> 18:40.368
Yes, Esther Jane?

18:46.417 --> 18:49.044
Oh, my God.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.358
Holy cow, it's the fire department.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.360
Oh, no.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.908
Wow, it's the cops.

20:12.545 --> 20:18.300
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.137
But he has refused to say who.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.267
But those who did it
know their blame.

20:29.353 --> 20:33.607
And I'm sure that the guilt you feel
is far worse. . .

20:33.774 --> 20:36.735
. . .than any punishment
you might receive.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.658
Now, don't you feel terrible?

20:43.993 --> 20:47.495
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?

20:47.997 --> 20:52.751
Well, that's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.506
Adults love to say things like that,
but kids know better.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.344
We knew darn well it was always better
not to get caught.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.931
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.769
I want you to write a theme.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.942
"What I Want for Christmas."

21:18.277 --> 21:19.861
The clouds lifted.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.364
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning. . . .

21:22.823 --> 21:24.866
I saw a faint gleam of light. . .

21:25.034 --> 21:27.911
. . .at the other end
of the black cave of doom.

21:28.079 --> 21:32.207
I knew that when Miss Shields read
my magnificent, eloquent theme. . .

21:32.375 --> 21:34.876
. . .that she would sympathize
with my plight. . .

21:35.044 --> 21:38.338
. . .and everything
would work out somehow.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.272
Boy, did you see how it stuck?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.691
Did it hurt, Flick?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.567
No. I never felt a thing.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.236
It just caught me off-guard.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.821
You sure were bawling.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.531
I never bawled.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.617
Baloney.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.089
Scut Farkus.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.425
Scut Farkus. What a rotten name.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.843
We were trapped.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.053
There he stood,
between us and the alley.

22:27.388 --> 22:31.099
Scut Farkus, staring out at us
with his yellow eyes.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.475
He had yellow eyes.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.936
So help me, God, yellow eyes.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.620
Grover Dill,
Farkus' crummy little toady.

22:52.788 --> 22:57.125
Mean, rotten.
His lips curled over his green teeth.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.960
Randy lay there like a slug.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.587
It was his only defense.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.844
-Say uncle.
-Uncle.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.805
-Uncle.
-Uncle!

23:10.973 --> 23:13.141
-Louder!
-Come on, get up. Now.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.935
-Louder!
-Uncle!

23:16.103 --> 23:18.772
-Louder.
-Uncle!

23:18.939 --> 23:21.566
In our world,
you were either a bully, a toady. . .

23:21.734 --> 23:24.611
...or one of the nameless rabble
of victims.

23:24.779 --> 23:28.281
All right, who's next?

23:49.595 --> 23:50.887
Man.

23:51.055 --> 23:55.016
In the jungles of Kid-dom,
the mind switches gears rapidly.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.518
Weeks ago, I had sent away...

23:56.685 --> 23:59.854
...for my Little Orphan Annie
secret society decoder pin.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.023
Oh, skunked again.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.776
No matter.
Today, I had serious work to do.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.570
"What I want for Christmas.

24:07.738 --> 24:10.031
What I want for Christmas
is a Red Ryder BB gun. . .

24:10.199 --> 24:13.159
. . .with a compass in the stock,
and this thing which tells time."

24:13.327 --> 24:14.536
Wow, that's great.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.288
"I think that everybody
should have a Red Ryder BB gun.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.707
They're very good for Christmas.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.419
I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present."

24:24.380 --> 24:27.298
Rarely had the words poured
from my penny pencil. . .

24:27.466 --> 24:29.843
...with such feverish fluidity.

24:35.057 --> 24:39.144
I've won, I've won, I've won !
Hey, go on now.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.562
Get out of here, you--!

24:46.193 --> 24:47.777
I've won, I've won.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.155
The Bumpus hounds.

24:50.531 --> 24:55.326
Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,
had at least 785 smelly hound dogs.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.705
And they ignored every other
human being on earth but my old man.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.332
Dumb dogs. Get.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.501
I won. I won.

25:03.669 --> 25:07.755
-I won, I won, I won !
-What? What is it? What?

25:07.923 --> 25:10.967
A major prize, a major prize.
I won, I won, I won !

25:11.135 --> 25:14.304
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.682
Tonight tonight is gonna be the night
Tonight tonight hot damn tonight

25:17.850 --> 25:21.352
-What does this mean here?
-It means it's coming tonight!

25:21.520 --> 25:23.563
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.

25:23.731 --> 25:28.359
He said that the telegram was late,
the prize was there, he'll send it on tonight.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.405
Come on, have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.

25:32.865 --> 25:38.286
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down Coral Gate--

25:41.540 --> 25:44.042
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.211
Or it could be a bowling alley.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.963
You know, a guy on Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.

25:49.131 --> 25:52.258
How are they gonna deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?

25:52.426 --> 25:54.552
They could send the deed
for chrissake.

25:54.720 --> 25:59.265
I mean, I didn't expect they were gonna
send the whole damn bowling alley.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.435
Yeah, well, how about eating, huh?
I'm starving to death.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.563
Getting rich is hard work, kid.
Come on.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.615
Every family has a kid who won't eat.

26:15.783 --> 26:20.787
My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily
in over three years.

26:21.121 --> 26:25.541
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.835
Gee.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.338
Starving people
would be happy to have that.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.715
Can I have some more red cabbage?

26:39.306 --> 26:42.976
You stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.

26:43.185 --> 26:46.521
You better stop fooling around
with that and eat it, or you'll be sorry.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.694
Can I please have some more?

26:52.861 --> 26:57.699
My mother had not had a hot meal
for herself in 15 years.

26:57.866 --> 27:02.036
Meat loaf, smeetloaf, double beetloaf.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.789
I hate meat loaf.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.834
All right.
All right, I'll get that kid to eat.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.752
Where's my screwdriver
and my plumber's helper?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.630
-I'll open up his mouth and shove it in.
-Randy.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.882
My mother was more subtle.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.926
How do the little piggies go?

27:18.012 --> 27:20.555
That's right:

27:20.723 --> 27:23.891
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.

27:24.059 --> 27:27.353
Show me how the piggies eat.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.231
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.132
Oh, my God.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.430
Mommy's little piggy.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.286
It is here.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.752
-Yeah.
-Are you Parker?

28:32.920 --> 28:34.670
-Yeah.
-All right, sign here, will you?

28:34.838 --> 28:36.923
-Well, what is it?
-I don't know.

28:37.091 --> 28:38.591
What's in it?

28:38.759 --> 28:40.468
Here. Bring it in, huh?

28:40.636 --> 28:42.929
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.

28:43.097 --> 28:44.972
Yeah. Bring it right on in. Right here.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.267
Bring it ahead.
Straight ahead. That's right.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.312
-Right.
-Here, bring it right, right on in, fellas.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.897
That's it. Here we go.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.315
A little more.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.859
A little more. That's it.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.030
Watch the lady.

29:08.664 --> 29:12.458
-That's it.
-Thanks a lot, guys. Merry Christmas.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.878
-Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
-Okay.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.173
"Fragile."

29:19.341 --> 29:22.760
-It must be Italian.
-I think that says fragile, honey.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.679
Oh, yeah.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.765
Here we go.

29:30.436 --> 29:35.690
Jeez, they really did a job on this,
you know?

29:41.405 --> 29:43.865
No, here, Ralph, hold that.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.034
Here we go.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.957
Honey, there could be
anything in there.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.667
Jesus.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.629
Maybe they forgot.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.841
No, it's in there.
It's gotta be in there.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.347
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

30:08.515 --> 30:14.270
-What?
-Would you look at that?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.690
What is it?

30:17.858 --> 30:19.984
Well, it's a leg.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.527
But what is it?

30:21.695 --> 30:25.364
Well, it's a leg.
You know, like in a statue.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.075
-Statue?
-Yeah, statue.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.745
Yeah, statue.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.205
Ralphie. . . .

30:32.372 --> 30:34.373
My mother was trying
to insinuate herself. . .

30:34.541 --> 30:36.417
. . .between us and the statue.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.586
Holy smoke, would you. . .?

30:38.754 --> 30:40.171
Do you know what this is?

30:40.756 --> 30:44.258
This is a lamp.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.094
-It was indeed a lamp.
-Isn't that great?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.555
What a great lamp.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.057
Well, I don't know.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.686
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.648
The old man's eyes boggled...

30:59.441 --> 31:00.775
...overcome by art.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.944
And I know just the place for it.

31:03.111 --> 31:07.323
Right in the middle
of our front-room window.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.334
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

31:18.961 --> 31:20.294
Watch it.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.755
Yeah, let's see.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.218
Oh, Jesus, God.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.890
-Oh, honey?
-No. It's all right. It's all right.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.475
It's all right.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.561
Let's see. . . .

31:36.728 --> 31:39.480
This goes to the radio. . .

31:39.648 --> 31:41.983
. . .and this goes to, and this goes--

31:42.150 --> 31:45.611
-Well, it's just one too many.
-One is tough, yeah.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.740
Well, let's see.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.827
The snap of a few sparks,
a quick whiff of ozone...

31:52.995 --> 31:56.539
. . .and the lamp blazed forth
in unparalleled glory.

31:56.707 --> 32:01.836
Oh, look at that. Will you look at that?
Isn't that glorious?

32:02.004 --> 32:04.922
It's indescribably beautiful.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.467
It reminds me of the Fourth of July.
Turn off all the lights.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.761
I wanna see
what it looks like from the street.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.348
-I'll go get the dining room.
-Couldn't we talk this over?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.519
Honey. . . .

32:34.286 --> 32:36.203
Move it a little bit to the right.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.955
Yeah. A little that way.

32:38.123 --> 32:42.668
Just a little more to the right.

32:42.836 --> 32:47.048
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop.
Right there. That's wonderful.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.966
Hey, Parker, what is that?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.052
Don't bother me now, Swede.
I'm busy.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.180
-Yeah, but what is that?
-It's a major award.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.183
A major award?

32:57.351 --> 33:00.019
Shucks, I wouldn't have knowed that.
It looks like a lamp.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.979
Well, it is a lamp, you nincompoop.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.024
But it's a major award. I won it.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.735
-Damn, hell, you say you won it?
-Yeah.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.655
Yeah, mind power, Swede, mind power.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.324
The entire neighborhood
was turned on.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.410
Oh, you should see what it looks like
from out here.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.246
It could be seen up and down
Cleveland Street.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.582
The symbol of the old man's victory.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.709
Yeah, he won that.
It's a major award.

33:23.877 --> 33:28.089
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.507
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.425
Holy smokes, it was 6:45.

33:31.593 --> 33:33.594
Only one thing
could've dragged me away. . .

33:33.762 --> 33:38.265
. . .from the soft glow of electric sex
gleaming in the window.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.269
Who's the little chatter box

33:42.437 --> 33:45.898
The one with pretty auburn locks?

33:46.066 --> 33:50.111
Whom do you see?
It's Little Orphan Annie

33:50.278 --> 33:52.321
Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.741
Brought to you by rich,
chocolatey Ovaltine.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.202
I could still taste it.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.705
Hey, you turned the light off.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.166
It's Little Orphan Annie

34:10.632 --> 34:12.425
Come on, you guys, wait up.

34:17.472 --> 34:21.141
I knew I was handing Miss Shields
a masterpiece.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.976
Maybe Miss Shields in her ecstasy. . .

34:23.145 --> 34:27.481
. . .would excuse me from theme writing
for the rest of my natural life.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.321
F!

34:35.157 --> 34:40.327
You call this a paragraph?
Margins, margins, margins.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.996
F!

34:42.289 --> 34:45.291
My life's work down the drain.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.835
A semicolon, you dolt. A period.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.504
Oh, F.

34:50.672 --> 34:56.010
I should weep
if I have to read one more F.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.512
Ralphie Parker.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.363
The theme I've been waiting
for all my life.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.365
Listen to this sentence.

35:18.533 --> 35:23.913
"A Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock. . .

35:24.080 --> 35:28.125
. . .and this thing which tells time."

35:28.752 --> 35:31.879
Poetry. Sheer poetry.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.549
Ralph, an A plus.

35:35.717 --> 35:41.388
My Ralph. Oh, Ralphie,
you've made me well.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.725
A plus.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.003
Ralph.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.007
Ralphie.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.135
Ralph.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.515
Is there something you want, Ralph?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.934
I'm just turning in my theme.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.063
Oh, well, you can take your seat now.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.818
Take your seat.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.574
You're a genius.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.459
Come on, you guys. Wait up.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.462
Okay. Come on. Come on.

36:59.301 --> 37:00.759
Come on.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.971
-Get in the car. Get in the car.
-Yeah.

37:04.139 --> 37:08.017
If we don't hurry,
we're gonna miss all the good trees!

37:08.184 --> 37:09.435
Go on, go on.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.646
My mother was about to make
another brilliant maneuver. . .

37:12.814 --> 37:15.649
. . .in the legendary battle of the lamp.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.027
The epic struggle which follows. . .

37:18.194 --> 37:21.989
. . .lives in the folklore
of Cleveland Street to this very day.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.158
Don't wanna waste electricity.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.994
-Don't--
-Don't wanna waste electricity.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.330
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.630
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees here.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.841
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.637
Now you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.722
This here tree is built to last.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.391
Ain't no needles coming off
this here tree.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.981
Okay. Now, here's a tree.
This here is a tree.

37:56.149 --> 38:00.527
-That's a little skimpy in the front there.
-Well, you just put it in the corner.

38:00.695 --> 38:04.740
-Haven't you got a big tree?
-Yeah. Hell, this ain't no tree.

38:04.908 --> 38:08.160
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.

38:08.578 --> 38:12.206
-Well, did I choose that one, huh?
-Well, don't you think it's a little large?

38:12.374 --> 38:15.542
No. What the hell. Listen, Christmas
only comes once a year. Why not?

38:15.710 --> 38:17.169
-Why not?
-Yeah, well, how much?

38:17.337 --> 38:20.089
I'll knock off $2 because
you're a man who knows his trees.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.884
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.552
No, that's them balsams.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.347
The old man loved bargaining
as much as an Arab trader. . .

38:28.515 --> 38:30.140
. . .and he was twice as shrewd.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.687
You know, Dew Lock just bought one
of those brand-new, green plastic trees.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.563
Oh, no.

38:36.731 --> 38:40.901
Darn thing looks like it was made
out of green pipe cleaners.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.530
This is a very nice tree.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.117
-I'll throw in a rope and tie it to your car.
-You got a deal.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.618
Deal.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.806
Damn it, blow out.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.358
Not again.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.154
Four minutes. Time me.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.450
Actually, my old man loved it.
He always saw himself in the pits. . .

39:29.617 --> 39:33.245
. . .at the Indianapolis Speedway
in the 500.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.997
Yeah.

39:37.459 --> 39:41.670
My old man's spare tires were actually
only tires in the academic sense.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.381
They were round,
they had once been made of rubber.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.300
Here we go.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.222
Ralphie.
Why don't you go help your father?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.433
-Really? Can I?
-Yes.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.144
-Watch the traffic there.
-Okay.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.938
It was the first time
that it had been suggested. . .

40:00.106 --> 40:03.484
. . .that I go help my father
with anything.

40:06.488 --> 40:09.448
-What are you doing here?
-Mom said I should help.

40:09.616 --> 40:10.824
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.785
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.579
Yeah, that's it. Now we've got it.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.332
-Here you are. Hold this. Here.
-Okay.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.338
No, not that way. Go on.
Come on, rat-trap, hold it like this. See?

40:24.506 --> 40:26.799
-How?
-Like this. I want to put the nuts in it.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.468
-Okay.
-See, there we are. There's four of them.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.845
And we got it!

40:33.348 --> 40:35.808
There it is. Oh, that son of a gun.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.393
I'm gonna get that dirty. . . .

40:38.686 --> 40:40.354
There we go. And--

40:40.522 --> 40:42.523
For one brief moment,
I saw all the bolts. . .

40:42.690 --> 40:46.485
. . .silhouetted against the lights
of the traffic, and then they were gone.

40:47.028 --> 40:52.950
Oh, fudge.

40:53.118 --> 40:57.037
Only I didn't say fudge.
I said the word.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.666
The big one.
The queen mother of dirty words.

41:00.834 --> 41:03.127
The F-dash-dash-dash word.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.711
What did you say?

41:08.174 --> 41:11.468
That's what I thought you said.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.972
Get in the car.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.893
-Go on.
-It was all over.

41:20.061 --> 41:24.231
I was dead. What would it be?
The guillotine? Hanging?

41:24.399 --> 41:27.776
The chair? The rack?
The Chinese water torture?

41:27.944 --> 41:31.655
Mere child's play compared
to what surely awaited me.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.910
Everything go all right?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.760
Eight minutes.

41:55.597 --> 41:59.391
-You know what your son just said?
-No. What?

41:59.601 --> 42:02.144
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!

42:05.607 --> 42:07.482
Ralphie!

42:08.526 --> 42:11.278
Over the years,
I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.238
My personal preference is for Lux...

42:13.406 --> 42:17.826
...but I found Palmolive had a nice,
piquant, after-dinner flavor.

42:17.994 --> 42:21.914
Heady, but with just a touch
of mellow smoothness.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.627
Lifebuoy, on the other hand. . . .

42:29.214 --> 42:30.464
You ready to tell me?

42:35.929 --> 42:38.805
All right.
Where did you hear that word?

42:38.973 --> 42:42.559
Now, I had heard that word at least
10 times a day from my old man.

42:42.727 --> 42:47.481
My father worked in profanity the way
other artists might work in oils or clay.

42:47.649 --> 42:50.442
It was his true medium. A master.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.860
But I chickened out.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.529
And I blurted out the first name
that came to mind.

42:54.697 --> 42:55.989
Schwartz.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.910
I see.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.299
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.

43:14.467 --> 43:18.470
Mrs. Schwartz, do you know
what Ralph just said?

43:19.722 --> 43:22.724
No. He said:

43:23.935 --> 43:26.019
No, not that!

43:26.187 --> 43:28.855
Yes, that.
Do you know where he heard it?

43:29.023 --> 43:30.440
Probably from his father.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.528
-No. He heard it from your son.
-What?! What?!

43:34.696 --> 43:37.197
What?!

43:42.203 --> 43:45.789
What did I do, Mom?
Why, I didn't do nothing.

43:51.379 --> 43:55.507
Another shot of mysterious,
inexorable, official justice.

43:55.675 --> 43:57.718
Rinse out and go to bed.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.429
Am I glad you finished your homework
this afternoon.

44:00.596 --> 44:03.390
I want you getting into bed.
I don't wanna see any lights on.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.393
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.562
I'm gonna come in.
If there are lights on--

44:08.730 --> 44:12.274
Don't you give me that look.
You're gonna get it.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.945
Kids.

44:33.254 --> 44:37.174
Three blocks away,
Schwartz was getting his.

44:37.717 --> 44:40.218
There has never been a kid
who didn't believe. . .

44:40.386 --> 44:42.387
. . .vaguely but insistently. . .

44:42.555 --> 44:45.640
. . .that he would be stricken blind
before he reached 21 .

44:45.808 --> 44:47.642
And then, they'd be sorry.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.697
Why, it's Ralph.

45:00.865 --> 45:04.493
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where you been?

45:08.498 --> 45:10.832
Why, he's carrying a cane.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.876
Yeah. What is it, Ralph?
What happened?

45:13.044 --> 45:17.381
-Why, he's blind !
-Blind?! Oh, my God.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.508
Ralph.

45:19.675 --> 45:25.138
-Ralph, is it something we did?
-What brought you to this lowly state?

45:25.306 --> 45:27.641
Ralph, please tell us,
no matter how it hurts.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.560
-What did we do?
-No, I can't.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.230
Oh, please, Ralph.
I must know what we did.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.482
-What brought you to this?
-Please.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.359
Please.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.569
Please?

45:39.862 --> 45:43.281
-It was--
-Yes?

45:43.908 --> 45:48.120
-Yes?
-Soap poisoning.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.336
Terrible. How could we do it?

45:56.504 --> 46:00.632
Well, I'll manage
to get along somehow.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.426
I'll never forgive myself.

46:02.593 --> 46:06.054
-Thanks, Mom.
-I told you not to use Lifebuoy.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.474
Oh, I feel awful.

46:13.479 --> 46:16.356
Oh, God.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.208
Thank you, Heather.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.502
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.713
-Thank you, Flick.
-Thank you.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.009
-Thank you.
-Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.

46:44.177 --> 46:45.969
Merry Christmas.

47:04.864 --> 47:08.575
Well, I just thought that you'd be
getting tired of the same old stuff.

47:08.743 --> 47:12.412
Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.749
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.

47:20.171 --> 47:22.005
Merry Christmas.

47:24.634 --> 47:26.092
Happy New Year.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.680
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

47:54.205 --> 47:58.708
The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine
in order to get the Ovaltine inner seal. . .

47:58.876 --> 48:02.629
...to send off for my Little Orphan Annie
secret decoder pin...

48:02.797 --> 48:05.173
. . .was about to pay off.

48:05.341 --> 48:06.591
I got it.

48:06.759 --> 48:10.303
"Master Ralph Parker."
My decoder pin.

48:14.183 --> 48:16.268
All right.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.191
"Be it known to all and sundry
that Ralph Parker. . .

48:23.359 --> 48:26.820
. . . is hereby appointed a member
of the Little Orphan Annie secret circle. . .

48:26.988 --> 48:30.198
. . .and is entitled to all the honors
and benefits occurring thereto."

48:30.366 --> 48:32.409
Signed, Little Orphan Annie.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.078
Countersigned, Pierre Andre.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.496
In ink.

48:36.664 --> 48:39.666
Honors and benefits.
Already at the age of 9.

48:42.378 --> 48:46.089
-But first, let's throw her overboard!
-Hold fast, then overboard!

48:46.257 --> 48:47.716
Come on, let's get on with it.

48:47.883 --> 48:50.677
I don't need all that jazz
about smugglers and pirates.

48:51.637 --> 48:54.014
Listen tomorrow night
for the concluding adventure. . .

48:54.181 --> 48:56.057
...of The Black Pirate Ship.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.893
Now it's time
for Annie's secret message. . .

48:59.061 --> 49:02.022
...for you
members of the secret circle.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.398
Remember kids. . .

49:03.566 --> 49:08.320
. . .only members of Annie's secret circle
can decode Annie's secret message.

49:08.487 --> 49:12.407
Remember,
Annie is depending on you.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.076
Set your pins to B-2.

49:15.244 --> 49:16.703
Here is the message:

49:17.538 --> 49:19.873
Twelve. Eleven. Two.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.375
I am in my first secret meeting.

49:22.543 --> 49:25.712
Fourteen. Eleven. Eighteen. Sixteen.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.756
Pierre was in great voice tonight.

49:27.923 --> 49:31.134
I could tell that tonight's message
was really important.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.219
Three. Twenty-five.

49:33.387 --> 49:36.806
That's a message from Annie herself.
Remember, don't tell anyone.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.980
Ninety seconds later,
I'm in the only room in the house. . .

49:44.148 --> 49:48.860
...where a boy of 9 could sit in privacy
and decode.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.404
Ah, B.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.491
I went to the next. E.

49:54.659 --> 49:56.409
The first word is "be."

49:56.786 --> 49:59.245
S. It was coming easier now.

49:59.413 --> 50:00.622
U.

50:01.207 --> 50:04.584
-Come on, Ralphie. I gotta go.
-Ralph?

50:04.919 --> 50:08.296
I'll be right down, Ma. Gee, whiz.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.509
T.

50:12.677 --> 50:13.718
O.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.221
"Be sure to." Be sure to what?

50:16.389 --> 50:19.182
What was Little Orphan Annie
trying to say? Be sure to what?

50:19.350 --> 50:21.935
Ralphie! Randy has got to go.
Will you please come out?

50:22.103 --> 50:25.438
All right, Ma. I'll be right out.

50:25.606 --> 50:27.107
I was getting closer now.

50:27.274 --> 50:30.193
The tension was terrible.
What was it?

50:30.361 --> 50:32.696
The fate of the planet may hang
in the balance.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.615
Ralphie, Randy's gotta go!

50:35.783 --> 50:38.618
I'll be right out, for crying out loud !

50:38.786 --> 50:40.328
Gee, almost there.

50:40.496 --> 50:43.540
My fingers flew.
My mind was a steel trap.

50:43.708 --> 50:47.168
Every pore vibrated.
It was almost clear.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.421
Yes, yes, yes!

50:49.839 --> 50:54.801
"Be sure to drink your Ovaltine."

50:55.469 --> 50:57.512
Ovaltine?

51:00.266 --> 51:03.017
A crummy commercial?

51:04.687 --> 51:07.230
Son of a bitch.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.817
I went out to face the world again.

51:10.985 --> 51:12.902
Wiser.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.168
-Red cabbage?
-That's for tomorrow night.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.171
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.

51:31.881 --> 51:35.175
You filthy system. . . !

51:36.510 --> 51:39.429
Smelly watt-buster. . . .

51:47.146 --> 51:51.316
What happened next
was a family controversy for years.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.709
What was that? what happened?

52:13.714 --> 52:15.298
What happened?

52:16.008 --> 52:17.467
What broke?

52:17.635 --> 52:19.594
I don't know what happened.

52:19.762 --> 52:24.808
I was watering my plant
and I broke your lamp.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.450
Don't you touch that.

52:42.743 --> 52:44.494
You were always jealous of this lamp.

52:45.579 --> 52:48.331
-Jealous of a plastic leg?
-Jealous!

52:48.499 --> 52:50.875
Jealous because I won.

52:52.461 --> 52:56.548
That's ridiculous. Jealous.
Jealous of what?

52:56.715 --> 53:00.385
That is the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen. . .

53:00.553 --> 53:02.011
. . . in my entire life!

53:02.179 --> 53:04.138
Now it was out.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.099
Get the glue.

53:06.267 --> 53:09.102
We're out of glue.

53:10.646 --> 53:16.526
You used up all the glue on purpose!

53:17.069 --> 53:19.070
The old man stood quivering
with fury. . .

53:19.238 --> 53:22.198
. . .stammering, as he tried to come up
with a real crusher.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.616
All he got out was:

53:23.784 --> 53:25.660
Not a finger!

54:05.576 --> 54:07.869
With as much dignity
as he could muster. . .

54:08.037 --> 54:10.413
. . .the old man gathered up
the sad remains. . .

54:10.581 --> 54:13.499
. . .of his shattered major award.

54:14.001 --> 54:19.589
Later that night, alone in the backyard,
he buried it next to the garage.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.674
Now, I could never be sure...

54:21.842 --> 54:25.637
. . .but I thought that I heard
the sound of "Taps" being played.

54:25.804 --> 54:27.138
Gently.

54:27.514 --> 54:29.265
Know what I'm getting my man
for Christmas?

54:29.433 --> 54:30.975
-No. What?
-A rose that squirts.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.186
People come to smell it,
it squirts them.

54:33.354 --> 54:34.938
I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.357
-A Flit gun?
-Yeah.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.402
Stop right there.

54:41.570 --> 54:45.823
-If Dill said hi to you, you felt great.
-Who, me?

54:45.991 --> 54:47.784
-Warm inside.
-Yeah, you. Get over here.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.870
-But mostly, he just hit you in the mouth.
-I can't now, Grover.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.789
-I've gotta see Miss Shields.
-Yeah.

54:52.957 --> 54:55.792
-Hey, come here! Get over here.
-Come back here. Come on, you !

54:55.960 --> 54:57.710
-Yeah, come on !
-Hey, come here!

54:57.878 --> 54:59.087
You.

54:59.380 --> 55:01.673
-Come here.
-Who, me?

55:01.840 --> 55:04.968
No, your Aunt Tilly.
Yeah, you. Get over here.

55:05.135 --> 55:08.388
I left Flick to certain annihilation.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.432
But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.559
Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle.

55:13.727 --> 55:16.020
Uncle! Uncle!

55:18.774 --> 55:20.066
All right, class. . .

55:20.234 --> 55:23.569
. . . I have your Christmas themes
for you.

55:23.862 --> 55:25.697
I'm pleased.

55:25.864 --> 55:29.158
In general, you did very well.

55:31.078 --> 55:36.249
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.252
This is it.

55:40.379 --> 55:42.797
C plus? Oh, no, it can't be.

55:42.965 --> 55:46.634
C plus?

55:47.177 --> 55:49.429
C plus!

55:54.309 --> 55:56.227
Oh, no!

55:56.812 --> 55:59.063
"You'll shoot your eye out"?

55:59.648 --> 56:00.898
Oh, no.

56:01.066 --> 56:03.026
My mother must have gotten
to Miss Shields.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.861
There could be no other explanation.

56:05.029 --> 56:09.449
You'll shoot your eye out
You'll shoot your eye out

56:11.452 --> 56:15.121
Was there no end to this conspiracy
of irrational prejudice...

56:15.289 --> 56:17.707
. . .against Red Ryder
and his peacemaker?

56:17.875 --> 56:20.460
These multiplication questions
were most missed. . .

56:20.627 --> 56:21.878
. . . in our last math test.

56:22.046 --> 56:23.838
Would you answer in unison, please?

56:24.006 --> 56:25.715
I was surrounded by happier kids...

56:25.883 --> 56:28.801
. . .who were all going to get
what they wanted for Christmas.

56:28.969 --> 56:30.720
Fifty-six.

57:01.001 --> 57:02.460
Hey, four-eyes.

57:02.628 --> 57:04.837
How'd you like
your snowball sandwich?

57:05.672 --> 57:08.508
Maybe you'd like another one.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.388
Listen, jerk.

57:14.556 --> 57:18.309
When I tell you to come,
you better come.

57:18.852 --> 57:21.354
What, are you gonna cry now?

57:21.522 --> 57:24.440
Come on, crybaby, cry for me.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.859
Come on. Cry.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.153
Deep in the recesses of my brain. . .

57:29.321 --> 57:33.032
. . .a tiny, red-hot little flame
began to grow.

57:45.420 --> 57:47.547
-Hey!
-Something had happened.

57:47.756 --> 57:51.843
A fuse blew
and I had gone out of my skull.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.013
Hey. Hey!

57:56.181 --> 57:57.723
Hey, kid !

58:00.811 --> 58:03.062
I'm telling my dad.

58:04.648 --> 58:08.151
Hey, Ralphie! All right, Ralphie.

58:13.407 --> 58:16.450
Beat him up! Beat him up!

58:17.077 --> 58:20.246
-Come on, hit him !
-Hit him !

58:21.373 --> 58:23.124
-Hang him !
-Hit him ! Kill him !

58:24.084 --> 58:29.130
You no-good damn knuckle!
Fanged dongs stinking bitch !

58:29.298 --> 58:31.048
-Come on.
-Enough with you, dork head.

58:31.216 --> 58:34.260
Did you hear what he said?

58:34.428 --> 58:36.846
Holy smokes!

58:37.598 --> 58:40.766
I have since heard of people
under extreme duress. . .

58:40.934 --> 58:43.269
...speaking in strange tongues.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.814
I became conscious
that a steady torrent of obscenities. . .

58:46.982 --> 58:51.861
. . .and swearing of all kinds
was pouring out of me as I screamed.

58:53.906 --> 58:56.991
Ralph, your mother.

59:00.329 --> 59:02.622
Ralphie! Ralphie! Ralphie!

59:02.789 --> 59:11.964
Ralphie!

59:12.257 --> 59:13.925
Ralphie?

59:17.554 --> 59:21.515
Come on. We're going home.
Come on.

59:35.614 --> 59:38.491
Let's go, man. Come on.
Let's go.

59:39.826 --> 59:42.995
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.

59:43.163 --> 59:44.914
Get in there.

59:45.999 --> 59:49.377
Okay. Put your head down in there.

59:49.544 --> 59:51.587
Come on. Get down in here.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.423
Settle down.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.510
Honey, I want you to go in there. . .

59:57.678 --> 01:00:01.013
. . .and lie down in your room
for a while.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:04.016
Ralphie, just settle down.

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:08.354
Come on. Here, dry off.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:10.648
Calm down.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.693
All right. Now go lie down.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.965
The light was getting purple
and soft outside.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:40.011
Almost time for my father
to come home from work.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.943
Randy.

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.404
Hi.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.866
What's the matter?
What are you crying for?

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.827
Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.412
No, he's not.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.540
-Yes, he is too.
-No, he's not.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:14.587
I promise you,
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:17.048
Why don't you come on out of there?

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:18.924
Huh?

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.802
Would you like some milk?

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.597
You would?

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.772
Here you go.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.274
All right?

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.776
I'll see you later?

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.195
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:54.377
I heard the car roar up the driveway,
and a wave of terror broke over me.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.630
He'll know what I said,
the awful things that I've said.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:00.132
Get out of here. Go on.
Get out of here!

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.677
Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy--!

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:07.765
Hey, Bumpus. Get over here
and get your stinking dogs!

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.310
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.125
Well, what happened today?

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.293
Where's your glasses?

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.130
Did you lose your glasses again?

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:43.592
Ralphie, remember you left these
on the radio again.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.471
Now, try not to do that anymore.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.598
So, what else happened today?

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.351
Oh, nothing much.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.353
Ralphie had a fight.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.523
A fight? What kind of a fight?

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.527
Oh, you know how boys are.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:05.531
I gave him a talking to.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:10.202
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:14.623
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.877
Oh, well, he'll freeze his keister off
out there.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:23.507
I slowly began to realize
I was not about to be destroyed.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.718
The Chicago Bears.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.179
The terror of the midway.
What a laugh. . . .

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:32.600
From then on, things were different
between me and my mother.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:36.979
Well, more like
the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.023
But Bears, never.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.484
Strange.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:45.404
Even something as monumental
as the Scut Farkus affair...

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.324
...as it came to be known,
was pushed out of my mind...

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:52.578
...as I struggled for a way out
of the impenetrable BB gun web...

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.914
. . .in which my mother had me
trapped.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.832
Santa!

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.251
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.253
Of course. Santa.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.547
The big man. The head honcho.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.090
The connection.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:08.135
My mother had slipped up this time.

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:32.701
-Mickey! Mickey!
-Yeah !

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:51.303
Mom, the store's gonna close soon
and Santa's gonna be gone.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:55.474
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:07.444
Mom, this is just the same
old dumb parade as last year.

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.905
Ralphie, will you please calm down?

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.323
-Mom !
-Hush !

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:13.492
Shut up, Ralphie.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.169
-There he is.
-Santa, Santa!

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:25.921
Yeah.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:29.842
Hey, Merry Christmas!

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:32.553
Santa.

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:35.139
Have you been a good boy? Have you?

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:36.515
Can we go now? Can we go?

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.309
-Yes.
-Yes, we can go now.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.019
Come on, Ralphie.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:56.744
Merry Christmas.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.538
Come on, Randy, hurry up.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.428
Ralphie, look over there.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.889
-See, the line's not so long.
-Yeah.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.642
Go get in it. Take Randy's hand
and hold on to him.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.895
-We will see you later, okay?
-Yeah, stay together, don't get lost.

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:24.271
Okay.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.194
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:34.740
Young man.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.910
Hey, kid.
Just where do you think you're going?

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.912
Going up to see Santa.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.247
The line ends here.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.791
It begins there.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.876
Merry Christmas!

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:47.628
Come on, come up, boys and girls.

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:49.588
Hurry up.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.007
Let's go.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.176
Oh, no.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.220
Come on.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:03.018
The line waiting to see Santa Claus
stretched all the way. . .

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.937
. . .back to Terre Haute.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:08.524
And I was at the end of it.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:12.361
-Merry Christmas.
-I like Santa.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:14.446
Yeah.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:16.323
Come on. Welcome. Come on.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:18.742
Let's face it.
Most of us were scoffers.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:23.122
But moments before zero hour,
it did not pay to take chances.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:29.169
The chocolate snowman
eats little boys.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:32.172
I'll get you my pretty.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.509
What a tasty little boy.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.094
Don't bother me.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:39.638
I'm thinking.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:46.103
I like The Wizard of Oz.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:47.938
Yeah.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:51.191
I like the Tin Man.

01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:59.116
If Higbee thinks I'm working
one minute past 9, he can kiss my foot.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.494
Come on, up on Santa's lap.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.496
There's a wet one.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.498
And what's your name, little boy?

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:10.294
-Have you been a good boy?
-Come on, Randy.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.921
And what do you want
for Christmas, Billy?

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.591
A toy truck? Get him off my lap.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.384
Quick, get me a towel.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.636
Bye, Billy.

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:27.685
Oh, I hate the smell of tapioca.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:33.192
Attention, shoppers.
It is now 9 p.m. and our store is closed.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.027
Nine o'clock? Great Scott!

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.154
The store's gonna close.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:40.323
Santa can't wait all night. Let's go.

01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:43.493
Come on up on Santa's lap.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.379
Get moving, kid.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.424
Quit dragging your feet.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.301
Come up.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.395
Get him out of here.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.700
Come on, kid.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.080
Come on.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.207
Come on up. Come on up there.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.390
And what's your name, little boy?

01:09:46.558 --> 01:09:50.602
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.020
Come on !

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:56.859
Listen, little boy, we got a lot of people
waiting here, so get going.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.444
Come on. Yeah. Come on.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.739
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.950
My mind had gone blank.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:07.661
Frantically, I tried to remember
what it was I wanted.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.663
I was blowing it, blowing it.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.582
Come on, kid.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.127
How about a nice football?

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:18.755
Football. Football. What's a football?

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.008
Without conscious will,
my voice squeaked out:

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:22.634
-Yeah.
-Football.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.428
Okay, get him out of here.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:28.307
A football. Oh, no.
What was I doing?

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:32.477
-Wake up, stupid, wake up. No!
-No!

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.235
No, no! I want an official. . .

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.822
. . . Red Ryder carbine action
200-shot range model air rifle.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.992
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.329
Merry Christmas.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:58.587
No!

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:05.302
And we're here to see the Wizard
The wonderful wizard of Oz--

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:09.014
I'll see you in Oz, folks.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.145
Well, did you. . .?

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.563
Up.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.774
-Did you see Santa Claus?
-Yeah.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.068
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:25.489
-Yeah.
-Did he ask you if you'd been a good boy?

01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:27.032
No.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.826
Don't worry, he knows.

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:31.912
He always knows.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.959
Merry Christmas.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:42.047
Okay, down you go. Bye-bye, Chris.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:45.717
Merry Christmas.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.351
That's fine.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.562
Now, wait a minute.
All right. Plug her in.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.398
It is, it is.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.149
Well, the green string is out.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.694
No, the green is on.
It's the blue that's out.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:07.531
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.
I'm not color blind.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.825
I'm not color blind either.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.660
There.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:15.038
There, see, I told you it was green.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:20.585
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.587
Hold it right there!

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.965
A fuse is out.

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:28.760
The old man could replace fuses
quicker than a jack rabbit on a date.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.304
He bought them by the gross.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.270
Oh, well.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.397
My, isn't that pretty?

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:43.108
Hot son of a gun.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:47.279
No, that star is crooked.

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:49.614
That star is perfectly straight.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.200
-Careful !
-That'll do it. It's all right. That's it.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.245
-Oh, be careful.
-I am, I am. It's--

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:58.331
Come on, let's set up the other thing.
Just let me get it fixed.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:01.043
That's all right.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:03.962
-Yes.
-Yeah.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.257
Perfect.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.304
Oh, goodness, look at the time.

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:14.806
I hope Santa hasn't had
to pass up this house. . .

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:17.559
. . .just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.312
Yeah, I thought I heard
Santa's sleigh bells. . .

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.565
. . .a little while ago going up
the other side of the street.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.151
-All right, you two, upstairs.
-Come on.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:29.571
Come on. On the double,
on the double:

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.541
Okay, let's get them.

01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:46.940
Randy. Randy, come on.
Get up, Randy.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.910
Santa Claus had come.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.792
Wow, a truck. That's mine!

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.003
Wow, look over here! That's mine!

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.921
Oh, what's in here?

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.339
Oh, it's hard.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:15.051
Fire truck. Oh, boy, that's mine!

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:19.639
Hey!

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.645
Does this raise?

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.821
Dad, Dad.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:42.412
Merry Christmas!

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:45.707
-Merry Christmas, you two.
-Merry Christmas.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.877
Now, Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.838
-I wanna play Santa.
-Well, wait a minute, Randy.

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:54.549
You played Santa.
He played Santa last year, didn't he?

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.885
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Ralphie, you play Santa this time.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.346
-Come on, Ralphie.
-Well, who should I start with?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.390
-Well, give Randy a present.
-Yeah ! Yeah !

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.560
And I think I see Aunt Clara's gift
to you right over there.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:08.355
She always sends you
such wonderful presents, Ralphie.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.690
-Give me mine, Ralphie. Come on.
-Okay.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.192
Come on, Ralph.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.960
Christmas had come. Officially.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:33.922
We plunged into the cornucopia,
quivering with desire. . .

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.758
. . .and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.760
Didn't I get a tie this year?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.393
A zeppelin.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.020
A can of simonize.

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:52.357
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:58.863
I don't want to.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:01.700
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:05.203
Aunt Clara had for years labored
under the delusion. . .

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:10.500
. . .that I was not only perpetually
4 years old, but also a girl.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:15.005
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.717
Oh, my God.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.720
Oh, isn't that sweet?

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.973
-Ralph, go upstairs and try it on if you--
-I don't want to.

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:27.350
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.061
She went to all that trouble to make it.
Now, go on.

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:42.657
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm gonna play Santa Claus.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.786
Now, let me see. What can I fi--?
Oh, I see something.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:50.457
-Randy. This is for you, honey.
-Oh, Jesus.

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:54.711
-Oh, and this is for Daddy.
-Oh, boy.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.090
Here. From me to you.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.886
Thanks a lot.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.097
I wonder what it could be?

01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:09.351
Only one way to find out, isn't there?

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.853
Well, it's a blue ball.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:16.232
It's a bowling ball.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.068
-Thank you, darling.
-Do you like it?

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:21.196
Yes, very much. Very much.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:24.282
Ralphie! We're waiting !

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.284
Oh, come on, Mom.

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:28.286
Right now!

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.883
Immediately, my feet began to sweat
as those two fluffy little bunnies. . .

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:46.054
. . .with the blue button eyes
stared sappily up at me.

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:49.641
Come down here
so I can see you better.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:51.976
I just hoped that Flick
would never spot them...

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.896
. . .as the word of this humiliation
could easily make life...

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.690
. . .at Warren G. Harding School
a veritable hell.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.361
Isn't that cu--?

01:19:01.529 --> 01:19:04.447
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:07.659
Shut up, Randy.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:09.953
He looks
like a deranged Easter bunny.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:13.665
-He does not.
-He does too.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:16.084
He looks like a pink nightmare.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.169
Are you happy wearing that?

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:21.131
Do you want to take it off?
Tell the kid to take it off.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:24.342
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.177
Take it off!

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.474
My God, would you look at that mess?

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.185
-Who's gonna clean the papers up?
-Not me.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:36.688
-Oh, no?
-Randy did it last year.

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:39.023
Well, he can do it again.

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:42.152
You know, this wine is not bad.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.279
It's not good either, but--
You want a sip?

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.865
-Yeah.
-No, you don't.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.868
-Did you have a nice Christmas?
-Yeah, pretty nice.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.495
Yeah? Did you get everything
you wanted?

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:53.872
Well, almost.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:59.836
Almost, huh? Well, that's life.
Well, there's always next Christmas.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:01.880
Yup.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.424
Hey, that's funny.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:08.636
-What's that over there behind the desk?
-Where?

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.431
Over behind the desk
against the wall over there.

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:15.602
Why don't you go check it out?

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:17.353
Go on.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.162
What did we put over there, honey?

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.122
Santa Claus probably put it.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.124
You. . . .

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:17.539
Oh, it was beautiful.
I could hardly wait to try it out.

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.916
-Do you know how to load it?
-Yeah.

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.584
Yeah?

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.629
Be careful. That's right.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:33.304
Be careful.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.306
Don't. They run all over.

01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:43.773
Close her up. Close it up.

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:45.858
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:49.571
-Sure.
-Okay. But outside.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.699
Oh, I still say those things
are dangerous.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:56.995
No, no! Put on your galoshes
and your coat. It's cold out.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:02.834
I had one when I was 8 years old.

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:04.419
-What if he hurts himself?
-Hey!

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:05.920
Ralphie, your coat!

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:10.592
-Don't shoot any animals or birds.
-Except the Bumpuses' dogs.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:14.762
Oh, you hush. Be careful, Ralphie.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.140
Now, it is well-known
throughout the Midwest. . .

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:20.518
. . .that the old man
is a turkey junkie.

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.771
-A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.
-Go fix your plumbing.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.691
A few days before Christmas
his eyes would begin to gleam. . .

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:29.777
-...with a wild and ravenous light.
-Go in the other room.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:39.037
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.509
Oh, my God! I shot my eye out.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.345
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:23:00.475
You'll shoot your eye out
You'll shoot your eye out

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:03.895
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out.

01:23:04.063 --> 01:23:06.773
She hadn't seen. She didn't know.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.526
My eye's all right.
The BB must have hit my glasses.

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:15.031
My glasses.
Oh, no, where are my glasses?

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:19.077
Few things brought such swift
and terrible retribution on a kid. . .

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.746
...as a pair of busted glasses.

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.919
Stop!

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.683
Oh, no.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:46.771
Oh, no. Pulverized.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.654
Oh, no.

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:02.870
For a moment, I thought, I'll fake it.
They'll never know the lens is gone.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.497
Oh, no.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:07.542
Rapidly my mind evolved
a spectacular plot.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:10.128
Let's see, an icicle. Yeah.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.755
Falls off the garage
and hits me in the eye.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.882
It would work. It had to work.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.301
Quickly, I whipped up some tears.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.303
Ralphie?

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.851
What's the matter, honey?

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:26.519
Oh, what happened? What is it?

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:27.979
Let me see that. What is it?

01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:30.940
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and hit me.

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:33.276
Come on inside out of the cold.
What is this?

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.363
-What?
-No, it's okay.

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:41.075
Just read your funnies. It's all right.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:44.996
Randy. Wake up, Randy.

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:50.126
Oh, God.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:54.297
It hit my cheek
and it broke my glasses.

01:24:54.465 --> 01:24:59.010
-And I tried to get out of the way, but I--
-Let's try this. Wait a second.

01:24:59.178 --> 01:25:02.847
There, see, it's just a little bump.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:05.850
Ralphie, you're lucky
it didn't cut your eye.

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:08.519
Those icicles have been known
to kill people.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:17.987
-What's going on up there?
-Nothing. We'll be right down.

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:19.572
You stay away from that turkey.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.992
It's got an hour to cook.
You'll get worms.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.123
But what about my glasses?

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:31.626
You can wear the old ones
with the crack in them. . .

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:34.545
. . . until we get you
some new ones, okay?

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:39.050
I had pulled it off.

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:41.469
But I left my gun outside.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:46.015
Yeah. Well, when you get dressed
you can go out and get your gun, okay?

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:47.725
Hold that on there.

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:49.727
Life is like that.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:54.732
Sometimes at the height of our revelries
when our joy is at its zenith. . .

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.777
. . .when all is most right
with the world. . .

01:25:57.945 --> 01:26:02.573
. . .the most unthinkable disasters
descend upon us.

01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:17.338
Oh, turkey!

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:24.095
Oh, my God.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.390
You sons of--!

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.941
Sons of bitches! Bumpuses!

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:54.250
The heavenly aroma
still hung heavy in the house.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.127
But it was gone. All gone.

01:26:56.295 --> 01:26:59.422
No turkey. No turkey sandwiches.
No turkey salad.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.424
No turkey gravy, turkey hash. . .

01:27:01.592 --> 01:27:04.051
. . .turkey Ã  la king,
or gallons of turkey soup.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.888
Gone! All gone!

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:14.562
All right! Everybody upstairs.
Get dressed.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.566
We are going out to eat.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:44.008
No, no, no.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:47.178
Not:

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:48.596
Sing like this:

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:58.189
Try again.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.992
Stop, stop, stop.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.078
Sing something else.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:28.386
No, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.638
Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.399
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:43.901
-Oh, yes.
-Look at that.

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:46.904
It's a beautiful duck. Yes, it really is.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:51.158
It's-- But you see, it's--

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:56.998
-What?
-It's smiling at me.

01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.920
Okay?

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:05.464
-Beautiful.
-Yeah. Yes, it's--

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:08.426
-Wonderful, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:11.512
That Christmas would live
in our memories as the Christmas...

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.224
. . .when we were introduced
to Chinese turkey.

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:18.185
All was right with the world.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:41.625
Oh, honey, come over here.
Look at this.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.754
Ooh, is that beautiful.

01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:55.973
Merry Christmas.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:34.553
Next to me in the blackness
lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:37.014
The greatest Christmas gift
I had ever received. . .

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:39.600
. . .or would ever receive.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:41.852
Gradually, I drifted off to sleep...

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:46.690
. . .pranging ducks on the wing
and getting off spectacular hip shots.
