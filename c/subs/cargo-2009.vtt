WEBVTT

04:30.270 --> 04:32.062
You were right.

04:32.481 --> 04:36.317
Ourworld is beyond salvation.
Even the last ones

04:36.735 --> 04:39.236
have left the Earth
and are coming up here.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.198
But the stations are overcrowded.

04:43.784 --> 04:48.913
Epidemics are spreading faster
and faster. l can't keep up.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.000
l see people die away
under my hands.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.845
l applied to work as a medic
on a cargo ship.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.556
Four years to get there,
four years to get back.

05:09.184 --> 05:13.229
l'll spend most ofthe time
in cryo-sleep. Just one flight,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.774
and l'll have enough money
to come to Rhea.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.443
And l'll be with you once again.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.911
Did you hear that, beloved sister?
l have to go now.

05:31.289 --> 05:35.501
l'm coming to Rhea to see you
and the children once again.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.836
Dr. Laura Portmann?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.255
Anna Lindbergh, First Officer.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.092
Welcome aboard.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.573
Listen up, everybody!

08:22.210 --> 08:24.628
Miyuki Yoshida, systems administrator.

08:26.673 --> 08:31.135
The bigmouth is Vespucci.
Thank God, Prokoff doesn't say as much.

08:33.805 --> 08:37.474
Dr. Portmann, our new medic.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.274
Station 42 will be expanded
to become a transportation hub.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.740
lt's in the Oort Cloud,
halfway to Proxima,

08:53.158 --> 08:57.286
and has been stabilized
in its orbit around RH278.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.123
Ourflight is fully automatic.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.294
Due to recent terrorist activities,

09:05.712 --> 09:08.422
the interim government
has ordered all flights

09:09.340 --> 09:13.343
to be accompanied
by sky marshalls.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.929
Fucking snitches!
- Word goes

09:16.347 --> 09:19.558
that the Luddites
are planning new attacks.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.854
This junk heap is falling apart anyway.
So who'd want to sabotage it?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.742
Lieutenant Samuel Decker,
Transitional Space Authority TSA.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.163
ln thirty minutes
the hold will be sealed off.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.833
Whoeverwants to get acquainted,
do it now.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.544
At 0200 the engines will ignite.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.173
At 0230
l will see you in the cryo-chamber.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.885
l wish you a pleasant stay.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.848
According to TSA Resolution 278

10:00.266 --> 10:04.144
sky marshalls will be present
on all cargo missions.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.980
Just see me as part ofthis crew.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.157
This is an informational film
from the TSA.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.784
The danger ofterrorist attacks

10:19.202 --> 10:21.328
was never bigger since the Big Collapse.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.788
Klaus Bruckner

10:23.206 --> 10:26.834
is still on the run after another bombing.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.505
This man is responsible
for the latest bombings

10:31.965 --> 10:33.423
on Stations 20,

10:33.842 --> 10:35.926
23, and 24.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.180
ln an admission statement
Bruckner repeats

10:40.598 --> 10:43.267
the reactionary beliefs ofthe Luddites.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.186
Where do we live? lnside of machines.

10:46.604 --> 10:51.275
What do we produce? Machines.
The TSA is the enemy.

10:52.318 --> 10:56.446
There'll be no peace
as long as technology rules us.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.741
Down with the machines!
Down with the stations!

11:00.160 --> 11:04.246
Due to recent incidents,
the TSA has ordered

11:04.664 --> 11:07.291
for the security ofthe ships
and the crews

11:07.709 --> 11:10.502
that all space flights be accompanied
by sky marshalls.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.131
Support your sky marshall in his duties...

11:14.549 --> 11:16.592
...be alert...

12:13.900 --> 12:16.944
Once again: the schedule of shifts.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.155
Duration: eight and a half months each.
l take over the first one.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.367
Then Lindbergh, Yoshida,

12:23.785 --> 12:26.245
Vespucci, Prokoff, Portmann.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.707
ln the end for unloading,
Lindbergh again.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.420
lf anybody has a problem with this,
you may knock on Decker's tank.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.086
3 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS LATER

14:45.802 --> 14:47.260
Dear Laura,

14:48.346 --> 14:51.264
l'm sending you
sunrays from Rhea.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.895
lt's been so long
since l held you in my arms.

14:58.439 --> 15:02.776
lt isn't good for you to do
cargo flights. We're worried.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.906
People say that the Luddites
are becoming more and more aggressive.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.743
But what can we believe when
the information is four years old?

15:12.161 --> 15:16.206
l don't dare to think what
could have happened in the meantime.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.292
l hope all is well with you.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.503
Please respond soon.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.588
See you soon.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.091
l miss you.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.979
lnitiating day phase.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.863
Day phase initiated.

16:18.227 --> 16:23.940
lnitiating night phase.
Please, proceed to resting position.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.422
DearArianne,

16:49.342 --> 16:51.426
l miss you, too.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.973
lt is so unbelievably cold here.
You could hardly imagine it.

16:58.768 --> 17:03.063
l'll show you some images,
so you can see the junk heap l'm in.

17:03.481 --> 17:07.317
Just two more months,
and my shift will be over.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.364
We are now four light years
away from the Earth,

17:12.782 --> 17:15.659
transporting construction material
to build a space station,

17:16.077 --> 17:19.704
so we can fly
to Proxima one day.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.958
They say there will also be
inhabitable planets out there.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.753
l wish l could be with you.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.341
Don't worry about me. l'm fine.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.218
See you soon.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.777
Hey, kids, come here!

18:48.669 --> 18:50.754
lnitiating night phase.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.299
Please, proceed to resting position.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.077
What are you doing here?

21:28.496 --> 21:32.332
Somebody opened the hatch.
l was woken automatically.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.168
Why did you open the airlock?

21:35.586 --> 21:39.005
You know that access to the cargo area
is strictly prohibited?

21:39.423 --> 21:44.469
There's someone down in the
cargo-airlock. - That's impossible!

21:44.887 --> 21:48.014
Something is behind the hatch.
We have to wake up the crew.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.643
No! The cryo-sleep phases
cannot be interrupted.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.145
But why don't you show me where it was.

21:55.397 --> 21:59.317
Regulations say that the captain must be
woken instantly in a case of emergency.

22:06.909 --> 22:10.245
Obviously, Dr. Portmann can't stand
to be alone very well.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.708
l'm sorry we had to wake you.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.505
You'd better be sure ofwhat you said.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.937
The cold protection suits were
whirled around by the high pressure.

23:48.719 --> 23:52.221
The compartment was left open
several times during your shift.

23:53.223 --> 23:57.226
l hope for your sake
that this was a technical malfunction.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.290
Come with me.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.238
The hold is divided into nine sectors.

26:14.656 --> 26:18.868
You check sectors A-C,
you check D-F, and l'll do the rest.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.621
Wouldn't it be better to stay together?

26:22.039 --> 26:24.207
l don't want to spend the night here.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.377
We'll keep in radio contact.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.235
The containers are all sealed.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.113
Copy that. You should know, Decker.

27:42.744 --> 27:47.707
l haven't found anything strange. Except
that we aren't fully loaded. Read me.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.959
Same here.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.171
Read you. Proceed further
Over and out.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.186
Lacroix for Laura?

28:11.440 --> 28:12.481
Lacroix!

28:15.736 --> 28:16.777
Damn it.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.780
Decker? Decker!

28:21.200 --> 28:24.327
What happened?
- Lacroix fell. - What? Where are you?

28:24.995 --> 28:27.580
ln Sector E-4-20
l'm going down to Sector G.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.207
l'm coming!

28:41.011 --> 28:47.308
Lacroix, can you hear me?

28:49.311 --> 28:51.938
ls he alive?
- We have to get him out of here.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.987
The hatch!

31:06.406 --> 31:09.575
According to regulations,
l assume command ofthe ship.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.620
Prokoff, Vespucci,
you repair the hatch.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.415
The hold
must be sealed off immediately. Yoshida:

31:16.833 --> 31:21.295
Verify all cryo-sleep log files.
Check for irregularities.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.422
And you examine Lacroix's corpse.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.050
l want a detailed report
on the cause of death.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.523
Recorder on.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.030
Multiple rib fractures.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.745
Cranio-cerebral injury.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.751
Obviously induced by a fall
from a big height.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.256
Death occurred just minutes
after impact.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.856
l thought we were transporting
construction material.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.067
l thought so, too.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.934
What's wrong with the hatch?
- lt's stuck.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.062
The transmission seems broken, too.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.258
lt must have been here.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.887
Sealed.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.225
Here's Lacroix's badge.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.806
A child...

37:06.641 --> 37:08.684
lt's a child!

37:14.649 --> 37:17.317
The containers are full of people.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.827
Vespucci, Prokoff ...

37:30.331 --> 37:31.457
Yes?

37:31.875 --> 37:34.752
Please, come to Sector F-7-21 .

37:43.011 --> 37:47.431
Why the hell are we transporting
people to Station 42?

38:01.154 --> 38:03.113
What's the problem now?

38:09.579 --> 38:10.579
Damn it!

38:13.458 --> 38:14.500
Hurry up!

38:16.044 --> 38:17.211
Come on! Come on!

38:21.508 --> 38:30.098
Laura!

40:30.053 --> 40:32.012
What's going on?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.348
The containers are full of people.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.024
That's none ofyour business.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.360
Lacroix was killed.

40:46.778 --> 40:50.739
Lacroix opened a container door
and must have been blown down by the pressure.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.909
Someone set the containers in motion
and nearly killed us.

40:54.327 --> 40:57.788
The containers are automatically
shifted to keep them from freezing.

40:58.206 --> 41:02.209
That's why the cargo hold is off-limits.
- Someone's on board the ship.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.795
He killed Lacroix and nearly us.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.214
Did you know
there are people in the containers?

41:10.426 --> 41:14.012
This tank goes back at once!
- This is a human being!

41:16.015 --> 41:18.767
As a doctor, l am responsible,

41:19.185 --> 41:21.770
and l'll examine this girl.
- l agree.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.983
And l am authorized
to investigate every incident on board.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.611
The containers and tanks
could be related to Lacroix's death.

41:30.029 --> 41:34.408
Then do your duty, but rest assured,
l will report this to the authorities.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.006
Examination ofthe tank.
Recorder on.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.146
lmpossible to get useful
scans from the abdomen.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.648
Switching to high frequency.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.324
HF scans are possible
in the cranial area.

42:16.743 --> 42:21.621
Girl shows weak brain activity.
l suspect a cryo-sleep coma.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.628
End of recording.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.340
Did you find anything?

42:34.135 --> 42:37.054
lt will take a while
before l have clear results.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.098
Can l help?
- Yes, perhaps.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.976
The tank is blocking the scanner's radiation.
And l can't open it.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.188
lt's secured with an electronic lock.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.623
Did you find anything?

43:07.794 --> 43:11.129
Give me all the information
you can find about Decker.

43:11.964 --> 43:15.175
There's something strange about him.
He should be on our side.

43:26.187 --> 43:29.314
Well?
- An asymetrical RSA encryption.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.691
This could take a while.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.292
What do you know about Station 42?

43:50.378 --> 43:52.462
An unmanned station.

43:52.880 --> 43:57.092
Officially it's being expanded
into a transportation hub.

43:57.510 --> 43:59.094
And unofficially?

44:01.514 --> 44:03.765
Why did you apply for this mission?

44:04.183 --> 44:06.059
l need the money. lt's that simple.

44:06.477 --> 44:09.479
You want to go to Rhea?
- Yes. - Why?

44:09.897 --> 44:14.901
My sister lives on Rhea.
She won a Rhea visa seven years ago.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.282
She's living our dream.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.740
Probably another automatic shifting
ofthe containers.

45:08.289 --> 45:11.416
What ifthere's something on board?
- Fuck it!

45:11.834 --> 45:14.461
Let's just finish this
and get out of here fast.

45:56.212 --> 45:57.545
Recorder on.

46:04.637 --> 46:08.181
The girl's brain is interconnected
with inorganic tissue.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.227
Entry point in the body:

46:12.645 --> 46:15.272
cervicalis C4
in the vertebral column ofthe neck.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.317
Looks as if it grew into her...

46:20.278 --> 46:22.612
...or ate its way in.

46:31.247 --> 46:32.414
A VR connector.

46:33.249 --> 46:36.918
lt's quite sophisticated.
l've never seen the likes before.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.337
We could connect her
to an external system.

46:39.755 --> 46:43.591
Much too dangerous.
lrreparable neural damage could occur.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.469
lt's the only way to find out
something about the connector.

46:46.887 --> 46:51.850
No way. l won't risk
the life ofthis child.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.269
As you like.

46:56.355 --> 47:00.608
The results ofthis examination
must remain between us.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.584
Arianne,

47:18.753 --> 47:22.005
so much happened l want to tell you about.

47:23.341 --> 47:27.927
Why are we apart?
News takes ages to arrive.

47:29.889 --> 47:32.807
l don't understand what's going on here.

47:33.225 --> 47:37.604
We found a girl in the hold.
l'm trying to help her.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.608
We'll see each other soon.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.235
And l'll tell you everything.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.370
l was happy to hearfrom you. lt's so great

48:35.788 --> 48:38.665
to hear your voice
and to know you're alive.

48:42.128 --> 48:45.964
You found a girl? l don't understand.

48:47.216 --> 48:49.509
l want to talk to you in person.

48:49.927 --> 48:53.304
Why does it always take so long
for these messages to arrive?

48:53.889 --> 48:55.348
Laura, listen.

48:56.142 --> 48:58.726
We don't want you to take cargo flights.

48:59.145 --> 49:00.395
Just come to Rhea.

49:00.813 --> 49:05.567
You can stay at our place,
and we can fix up a room for you.

49:07.027 --> 49:10.905
l'm looking forward to seeing you.
Soon you will be with us.

49:33.762 --> 49:35.638
l don't understand what's happening.

49:41.187 --> 49:44.189
How can my sister
answer me so quickly?

49:48.527 --> 49:50.862
Why do you know
all about VR connectors?

49:56.202 --> 49:58.620
Why shouldn't l tell anyone
about the examination?

50:02.541 --> 50:05.710
What do you know
about the people in the tanks?

50:10.591 --> 50:12.425
Who are you anyway?

51:56.113 --> 51:58.072
This is First Officer Lindbergh.

51:58.490 --> 52:01.451
The entire crew
on the bridge at once!

52:04.163 --> 52:09.042
Yoshida verified all log files
and compared them with the backups.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.545
She found out
that a member ofthe crew

52:12.963 --> 52:15.089
manipulated the cryo-sleep log files.

52:18.969 --> 52:22.221
Why didn't you tell us
you were repeatedly awakened?

52:23.724 --> 52:27.060
lt is one of my duties
to regularly check the ship.

52:27.478 --> 52:31.064
You don't deny that you left your tank
without our knowledge?

52:31.732 --> 52:33.316
No, that is correct.

52:33.734 --> 52:37.487
Where were you when Lacroix fell?
- The guy is a dirty snitch!

52:39.865 --> 52:42.200
l was in Sector F-5-17.

52:42.826 --> 52:46.579
As a TSA agent,
l don't owe you any explanations.

52:48.749 --> 52:50.375
Arrest him.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.711
Put down your gun!

52:56.006 --> 52:58.841
l enjoy immunity. You know that.

52:59.176 --> 53:02.053
Not for murder. Put the gun down.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.123
lfyou hadn't struggled
l might have believed you.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.877
Vespucci,
how long do you need for the hatch?

53:34.878 --> 53:36.754
48 hours.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.969
Dr. Portmann, l want the tank
returned to the hold.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.596
That's impossible. l gave the girl

53:46.014 --> 53:50.184
medication to make the threads in
the brain regress. She's too unstable.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.562
l don't care.

53:52.980 --> 53:56.023
l want the tank returned before
the hatch is closed. That's an order!

53:56.775 --> 53:58.860
Did l make that clear enough?

54:01.905 --> 54:03.448
Put him in cryo-sleep.

54:04.074 --> 54:08.244
lf l don't stop the bleeding
it will contaminate the cryo-liquid.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.110
You're doing a good job.

54:46.909 --> 54:49.952
Did you hearfrom your sister again?

55:26.031 --> 55:28.908
Vespucci, report to the medlab.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.910
Laura? Laura, wait.

55:37.459 --> 55:39.710
We aren't flying to Station 42.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.422
Where are we flying to?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.425
Rhea.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.145
Can you help me?

56:39.563 --> 56:43.816
Could you find out
ifwe're really flying to Station 42?

57:21.396 --> 57:22.772
Well?

57:23.732 --> 57:26.150
l was on the bridge
and logged into the system.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.487
The target coordinates of ourflight
are highly confidential and encrypted.

57:29.905 --> 57:34.367
But l am certain that
we are not flying to Station 42.

57:36.286 --> 57:40.164
One other thing is certain, too.
lt is impossible for someone

57:40.582 --> 57:43.668
to manipulate the target coordinates
during the flight.

57:44.086 --> 57:46.379
They can only be
programmed before takeoff.

57:47.839 --> 57:51.509
l'll try to find out
where we are flying to.

57:54.179 --> 57:58.933
But Decker had no opportunity
to change the coordinates.

57:59.851 --> 58:03.187
How long does it take
to send a message from here to Rhea?

58:04.648 --> 58:06.357
lt takes ages, as usual.

58:07.734 --> 58:09.318
Several years.

58:10.737 --> 58:14.156
My sister answered me
within just 20 minutes.

58:14.574 --> 58:18.327
lfthat's true,
then Lindbergh was lying.

58:19.746 --> 58:22.915
She is the only person
who can access the coordinates.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.210
Decker said, we're flying to Rhea.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.297
Hey, hey, hey! Here you are!

58:30.716 --> 58:32.425
The hatch is fixed.

58:32.843 --> 58:36.053
So Prokoff and my humble self
invite you to a party.

58:38.265 --> 58:42.059
No time.
- What about the party?

58:42.602 --> 58:44.603
Thanks for your help.

58:45.522 --> 58:50.860
But you'll join us, won't you, Doctor?
We heated the men's quarters.

59:05.584 --> 59:08.169
You won't be staying long either, right?

59:09.504 --> 59:12.673
Our last medic went to Rhea.

59:15.677 --> 59:19.388
Guys like us will never
be able to afford that, huh?

59:51.546 --> 59:53.839
Doesn't taste that lousy.

1:00:11.483 --> 1:00:13.943
That was probably the heating system.

1:00:20.575 --> 1:00:24.120
What are you doing?
The party isn't over yet.

1:00:24.538 --> 1:00:26.705
l'm bringing Yoshida a cup oftea, too.

1:00:28.542 --> 1:00:32.336
Okay, but hurry,
and don't let Lindbergh know.

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:35.840
She'd ruin the whole party.

1:00:36.258 --> 1:00:38.634
Don't worry. l'll be right back.

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:10.541
Yoshida?

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:03.093
Decker ...

1:02:03.511 --> 1:02:05.596
That pig just disappeared.

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:10.893
When l get hold of him ...

1:02:12.270 --> 1:02:16.232
He was manually wakened.
Someone must have helped him.

1:02:16.650 --> 1:02:19.610
lt seems
we have a stowaway on board.

1:02:20.028 --> 1:02:21.737
Damn it!

1:02:22.155 --> 1:02:24.114
We'll search the entire ship.

1:02:24.532 --> 1:02:27.743
You go with Portman.
l'll go with Prokoff.

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:31.789
We start on the main decks.
l'll lock all the hatches.

1:02:32.207 --> 1:02:34.166
lfwe don't find anything here,
we'll search the rest.

1:03:39.441 --> 1:03:42.609
Medlab is clean.
Did you find anything?

1:03:43.403 --> 1:03:46.697
Not yet. We're at the air lock.

1:03:58.126 --> 1:04:00.210
lt's coming from down below.

1:04:06.343 --> 1:04:09.011
We'll search the lower levels.

1:04:32.869 --> 1:04:37.122
l think we got him.
He must be in this shaft.

1:04:39.459 --> 1:04:43.754
You go down here,
and l'll join you from the other side,

1:04:44.172 --> 1:04:46.256
and we'll finish him off.

1:04:57.477 --> 1:05:00.813
When he hears me coming,
he'll have to turn back.

1:05:01.231 --> 1:05:04.942
When you see him, fire. Boom!
Dead as a doornail.

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:10.280
That bastard killed Yoshida
and Lacroix. Don't forget that.

1:07:03.603 --> 1:07:06.355
De... to... n ...

1:07:08.441 --> 1:07:11.818
De...to..nate...

1:09:09.562 --> 1:09:12.314
Everything grows like it used to.

1:09:13.441 --> 1:09:17.653
They were lying to us
from the start. These plants

1:09:18.071 --> 1:09:19.321
are edible.

1:09:19.947 --> 1:09:23.158
The greenhouses protect the plants
from the acid rain.

1:09:24.911 --> 1:09:28.330
We cleanse the water ourselves
in subterranean tanks.

1:09:28.748 --> 1:09:32.084
We are completely independent
ofthe system.

1:09:32.502 --> 1:09:34.461
And we're growing in number.

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:38.256
New people join us every day.

1:09:53.690 --> 1:09:55.190
Don't move!

1:09:57.151 --> 1:10:01.571
Thank God, you're still alive.
- Vespucci! Where were you? - Calm down.

1:10:01.989 --> 1:10:04.783
Everything is under control.
We captured him.

1:10:05.827 --> 1:10:07.911
Did you fire the shot?

1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:12.666
Who's this?

1:10:13.584 --> 1:10:14.626
Bruckner.

1:10:21.551 --> 1:10:23.385
What was your plan?

1:10:40.987 --> 1:10:43.113
Don't try to be a hero.

1:10:43.531 --> 1:10:47.033
Bruckner is dead.
Who are you trying to protect?

1:10:47.869 --> 1:10:51.663
Rhea is a simulation.
lt's all a lie.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:55.125
The people in the tanks ...
- Nonsense!

1:10:55.668 --> 1:10:59.796
Their brains are used as neural units
to run the simulation.

1:11:00.214 --> 1:11:02.424
We communicate daily
with the people of Rhea.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:07.471
Kuiper lndustries is lying to all mankind.
lt's all top secret. - Take him away.

1:11:08.222 --> 1:11:11.892
lf people knew that parts
ofthe Earth are inhabitable ...

1:11:12.685 --> 1:11:15.061
the whole system would fall apart.

1:11:15.396 --> 1:11:17.481
You killed him, didn't you?

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:21.985
He went crazy. He killed Lacroix.

1:11:22.403 --> 1:11:23.862
And Yoshida?

1:11:26.073 --> 1:11:27.491
Take him away!

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:39.419
How's your little patient doing?
- Fine.

1:11:40.588 --> 1:11:44.090
l think... we can take her
back to the hold now.

1:11:45.134 --> 1:11:46.343
Excellent!

1:11:46.761 --> 1:11:49.054
Prokoff and Vespucci will help you.

1:11:49.472 --> 1:11:53.141
We can finally close the hatch.
And you will enter cryo-sleep.

1:11:53.559 --> 1:11:55.727
l'll take over your shift.

1:12:43.901 --> 1:12:47.028
So you know all about Rhea?

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:18.685
The simulation
is only a temporary solution.

1:13:24.191 --> 1:13:27.360
The settlement of Rhea
failed from the start.

1:13:29.906 --> 1:13:34.409
The changes we made in the planet's
ecosystem unfortunately turned out bad.

1:13:36.871 --> 1:13:39.247
We'll find a new planet.

1:13:39.790 --> 1:13:43.043
And we won't repeat the mistakes
we made on Rhea.

1:13:43.461 --> 1:13:47.631
But until then,
people need something to live for.

1:13:48.758 --> 1:13:50.759
They need hope.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:59.059
What about the people who realize
they're living in a simulation?

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:11.112
The simulation is perfect.
l was inside myself. lt's impossible

1:14:11.530 --> 1:14:13.573
to find out.

1:14:14.909 --> 1:14:16.701
Why are you doing this?

1:14:21.499 --> 1:14:23.833
You just don't understand.

1:14:26.128 --> 1:14:28.129
We'll soon be on Rhea,

1:14:28.547 --> 1:14:31.549
but you and your luddite
won't reach Rhea alive.

1:14:31.968 --> 1:14:35.679
Everyone will understand that
the captain's murderers died in action.

1:14:39.350 --> 1:14:42.644
Did you know we're flying to Rhea?

1:15:10.589 --> 1:15:12.549
But Rhea is only a simulation.

1:15:12.967 --> 1:15:17.137
Who the hell cares! All that matters
is that we get offthis junk heap.

1:15:20.099 --> 1:15:23.018
And what about my little plants?
- Jerk!

1:15:23.436 --> 1:15:27.981
They have more plants there than you could
ever dream of. Rhea has everything.

1:15:28.399 --> 1:15:29.482
Everything!

1:15:41.078 --> 1:15:43.496
l couldn't tell you the truth.

1:15:56.802 --> 1:16:00.180
Laura, there are several reasons
not to trust me.

1:16:06.270 --> 1:16:10.607
But we are the only ones
who can complete this mission.

1:16:12.610 --> 1:16:14.360
Will you help me?

1:16:16.072 --> 1:16:19.783
Will you help me
save my sisterfrom the tank?

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:24.454
We have to work together.
One can't enter the simulation alone.

1:16:24.872 --> 1:16:27.749
The Kassandra docks at Station 42 as planned.

1:16:28.167 --> 1:16:31.086
The unloading timer can be delayed
by only 30 minutes.

1:16:31.504 --> 1:16:34.672
When the timer hits zero, the Kassandra
is unloaded automatically.

1:16:34.673 --> 1:16:39.469
Laura and l exit the ship and we fly to the mainframe
module.There l jack her into the system.

1:16:39.470 --> 1:16:41.304
How should that work?

1:16:41.847 --> 1:16:47.143
The hardware ofthe simulator
is accessible from these modules.

1:16:51.482 --> 1:16:55.235
Wth this interface,
l will connect Laura directly

1:16:55.653 --> 1:17:00.240
to the mainframe. She will send a message
to Earth from inside the simulation.

1:17:00.658 --> 1:17:03.409
ln the meantime,
l'll look for her sister's tank.

1:17:04.453 --> 1:17:07.247
After that, we'll blow up
the transponders ofthe main antennas.

1:17:09.375 --> 1:17:11.417
The station will remain fully operational.

1:17:12.128 --> 1:17:15.755
That means: the people will
continue living in their simulation.

1:17:16.173 --> 1:17:21.094
But they can't send any more messages back to Earth.
Laura's message will be the last one.

1:17:21.512 --> 1:17:24.681
l hope that people at home
will believe us.

1:17:43.033 --> 1:17:47.537
STATlON 42 lN ORBlT AROUND RH278

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:06.097
ls the Earth really inhabitable again?

1:18:06.515 --> 1:18:09.350
We made three expeditions.

1:18:10.769 --> 1:18:12.604
Nature is alive.

1:18:13.564 --> 1:18:15.690
lt's taking over again.

1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:21.362
Entire cities are overgrown,
covered up to the 2nd floor.

1:18:24.992 --> 1:18:28.161
l'll take Arianne back to Earth.

1:18:29.997 --> 1:18:32.457
There are millions oftanks, Laura.

1:18:33.626 --> 1:18:35.752
Even ifwe find her,

1:18:36.670 --> 1:18:39.505
l don't know
what condition she's in now.

1:18:39.924 --> 1:18:42.217
She was in simulation for a long time.

1:18:45.971 --> 1:18:48.056
We have to try it.

1:18:48.474 --> 1:18:50.975
l'd so love to show her the Earth.

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:50.076
Has this interface been used yet?

1:19:50.494 --> 1:19:54.289
No, it's a prototype.
lt works like an external VR connector.

1:20:02.798 --> 1:20:04.966
Don't be afraid.

1:20:10.681 --> 1:20:11.806
27 minutes.

1:20:15.811 --> 1:20:19.772
Hey, don't you think we should
reconsider? - What?

1:20:20.190 --> 1:20:22.442
l'm doing this for you and for me.

1:20:22.860 --> 1:20:27.030
l'm not missing the chance. We'll throw
two guys out oftheir tanks and get in ourselves.

1:20:27.448 --> 1:20:30.616
When the ship is unloaded,
we'll be on Rhea.

1:20:36.749 --> 1:20:37.790
Fuck!

1:20:42.004 --> 1:20:43.713
Damn it.

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:27.650
Prokoff, can you hear me?
l have Lindbergh's badge.

1:22:28.068 --> 1:22:32.155
Reset the unloading timer
to ten minutes. Understand?

1:22:32.573 --> 1:22:38.369
Otherwise, the containers won't be
unloaded, and we won't be on Rhea. Got that?

1:22:46.336 --> 1:22:49.213
We have to hurry.
We'll meet in the hold, okay?

1:22:54.178 --> 1:22:56.262
Decker, can you hear me?

1:22:57.222 --> 1:23:00.016
l'm having trouble with my fuel cell.

1:23:00.434 --> 1:23:01.809
Decker?

1:23:02.352 --> 1:23:03.394
Decker!

1:23:04.354 --> 1:23:05.396
Laura?

1:23:06.690 --> 1:23:10.860
The cell isn't working properly.
l think ... nitrogen supply ...

1:23:11.653 --> 1:23:15.781

1:25:28.999 --> 1:25:30.041
Decker?

1:25:31.251 --> 1:25:33.127
Can you hear me? Decker?

1:25:33.670 --> 1:25:35.379
l can't control myjetpack!

1:25:37.382 --> 1:25:39.008
l'm drifting off!

1:25:41.595 --> 1:25:43.429
Decker, where are you?

1:26:19.549 --> 1:26:20.591
Decker?

1:26:21.593 --> 1:26:22.927
Where are you?

1:26:39.152 --> 1:26:40.611
l can see you.

1:27:43.008 --> 1:27:45.050
l found Arianne's tank.

1:27:45.927 --> 1:27:48.345
lt's impossible.
She's been in there for too long.

1:27:48.972 --> 1:27:50.431
l'm sorry.

1:27:52.225 --> 1:27:54.226
l have to see her.

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:58.272
Program my target coordinates
to where my sister lives.

1:27:59.149 --> 1:28:01.442
l'll send the message from her place.

1:28:03.445 --> 1:28:04.487
Okay.

1:28:38.188 --> 1:28:39.855
Look, the Kassandra.

1:28:48.782 --> 1:28:52.076
Prokoff and Vespucci ... Those stupid idiots!

1:28:52.369 --> 1:28:56.121
We have seven minutes at most.
l'll get you out manually.

1:28:56.998 --> 1:28:58.040
Okay.

1:32:21.286 --> 1:32:25.414
Laura?

1:32:25.832 --> 1:32:26.874
Arianne?

1:32:29.919 --> 1:32:30.961
Laura!

1:32:53.693 --> 1:32:55.778
Look how nice it is here.

1:32:59.657 --> 1:33:01.742
At last you see how it is.

1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:03.243
At last.

1:33:04.370 --> 1:33:06.872
And your room is almost ready.

1:33:07.874 --> 1:33:09.875
You look beautiful.

1:33:11.252 --> 1:33:14.922
Come on in.
l'll show you everything. Kids,

1:33:15.340 --> 1:33:16.423
look who's here!

1:33:21.304 --> 1:33:22.638
Laura, are you crying?

1:33:32.190 --> 1:33:34.274
Arianne, l have to leave for a moment.

1:33:34.692 --> 1:33:35.734
Yes?

1:33:36.486 --> 1:33:40.447
What's wrong
- l love you, Arianne.

1:33:44.994 --> 1:33:46.620
Laura?

1:33:48.123 --> 1:33:49.706
Laura, where are you going?

1:33:50.583 --> 1:33:52.042
Laura!

1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:49.016
My name is Laura Portmann.

1:34:49.434 --> 1:34:52.227
This is the last message from Rhea.

1:34:52.645 --> 1:34:54.730
Rhea is not paradise.

1:34:55.607 --> 1:34:57.691
Rhea is a simulation.

1:34:58.776 --> 1:35:00.903
We will bring you proof.

1:35:01.946 --> 1:35:04.531
We were all deceived.

1:35:05.992 --> 1:35:08.785
Everything that was said
about Rhea is a lie.

1:35:09.787 --> 1:35:11.872
We don't need Rhea.

1:35:12.874 --> 1:35:15.250
But we still have the Earth.

1:35:15.668 --> 1:35:18.045
The Earth is once again inhabitable.

1:35:19.631 --> 1:35:20.672
No one

1:35:21.090 --> 1:35:23.842
will ever be in contact with Rhea again.

1:35:24.886 --> 1:35:27.346
We'll blow up the antennas now!

1:35:50.662 --> 1:35:51.703
Laura?

1:35:55.917 --> 1:35:57.376
Do you hear me?

1:35:57.752 --> 1:35:58.794
Yes.

1:35:59.963 --> 1:36:03.548
Okay, we have to hurry.
The Kassandra will take off any minute.

1:36:05.093 --> 1:36:06.677
And you have to go back alone.

1:36:07.095 --> 1:36:08.136
Alone?

1:36:11.057 --> 1:36:11.932
Yes.

1:36:13.893 --> 1:36:19.273
l won't go without you. - You have to.
We won't get farwith only one jetpack.

1:36:20.024 --> 1:36:23.485
l gave you my fuel cell.
lt has enough fuel

1:36:23.903 --> 1:36:27.531
to take you back to the Kassandra.
- l'm not leaving without you.

1:36:29.826 --> 1:36:33.745
Go back to the girl.
She's our only proof.

1:36:44.882 --> 1:36:46.008
The engines!

1:37:03.943 --> 1:37:04.985
Go!

1:37:07.822 --> 1:37:10.282
l can't!
- You have to!

1:37:11.701 --> 1:37:13.076
Now!
- No!

1:37:16.331 --> 1:37:17.664
...l love you!

1:40:02.288 --> 1:40:04.498
Where is the girl?

1:40:26.979 --> 1:40:29.189
No one will ever send messages
from Rhea again.

1:43:28.536 --> 1:43:32.956
My name is Laura Portmann.
This is the last message from Rhea.

1:43:33.916 --> 1:43:36.000
Rhea is not paradise.

1:43:36.919 --> 1:43:39.003
Rhea is a simulation.

1:43:40.047 --> 1:43:42.298
We will bring you proof.

1:43:43.300 --> 1:43:45.301
We were all deceived.

1:43:46.929 --> 1:43:48.930
We don't need Rhea.

1:43:49.765 --> 1:43:51.850
We still have the Earth.

1:43:52.685 --> 1:43:54.811
The Earth is once again inhabitable.

1:43:56.772 --> 1:44:00.650
No one will ever be
in contact with Rhea again.

1:44:02.486 --> 1:44:05.113
We'll blow up the antennas now!
