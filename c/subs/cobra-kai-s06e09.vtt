00:52.343 --> 00:55.263
Couldn't meet at the Four Seasons?
You had to pick this shithole?

00:55.805 --> 00:57.974
So I have some good news.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.395
Got the judge to officially throw away
your case. Not that it was tough.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.440
That Raymond Porter character,
you know, the Stingray guy?

01:05.523 --> 01:07.192
Least credible witness of all time.

01:07.692 --> 01:10.487
He tried to get this kid, Bert,
to testify on his behalf.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.823
It was the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen in a courtroom.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.450
[cheering]

01:21.998 --> 01:23.625
Look, Terry.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.211

you've been acting--

01:26.294 --> 01:27.128
[glass thuds]

01:27.712 --> 01:30.048
I'm just saying you blew
a lot of money on those dojos.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.633
You're lucky to have the yacht left.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.010
I don't want you
to go on a downward spiral and

01:34.094 --> 01:35.762
end up in the morgue
like your buddy, Snake.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.766
We'll all end up there someday.

what you're gonna want--

02:15.844 --> 02:17.220
That's all I needed to hear.

Baby, are you okay?

-No, not here.

Lost ownership of your dojo.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.592
Some problems can be solved in the cage,
but not this one.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.345
You got into bed
with the wrong people, friend.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.388
Ah.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.099
Are you my friend now?

No.

I'm your savior.

I'm here to pay off all your debts.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.400
What's the catch, then?

03:12.483 --> 03:14.235
As defending champions,

03:15.111 --> 03:18.698
your team has an automatic berth
to the Sekai Taikai.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.159
I have some friends
who wanna play spoiler.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.578
You show them the error of their ways

03:24.162 --> 03:27.916
by embarrassing them
in front of the world,

03:28.708 --> 03:33.087
and I'll sign ownership of the dojo
back to you forever.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.088
[Wolf] Hm.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.924
Consider it done.

-Yes.
-[man] No.

No. Nothing's done here. Come on, Terry.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.679

Think about your legacy.

[Silver] Legacy?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.516
Those sons of bitches
ruined my reputation.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.938
They took the one thing
left in the world I cared about.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.523
So, if I'm going to hell…

03:54.525 --> 03:55.944
I'm taking 'em down with me.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.156
You were behind my kidnapping?

04:02.909 --> 04:06.037
Your obsession with your mentor's past
made it way too easy.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.456

You got three seconds to get out of there.

Or we're gonna get you out.

What do we do now?

05:37.086 --> 05:38.796
We can't hide this from the kids.

If we're gonna take on Kreese and Silver,

what went down in the Valley.

Becoming the number-one dojo worldwide.

06:28.096 --> 06:32.016
Silver cannot win with Cobra Kai,
so he buys another dojo.

And we all know from experience
he's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

Kenny, I am truly sorry.

And I've always liked you.

You were always cool with me
when we trained with Silver, so,

07:47.884 --> 07:50.219
honestly, you targeting me
is kind of flattering.

Oh, 'cause he's taking Devon's spot.

What, so he just forgave her
all of a sudden?

it's happened yet.

All I'm saying is
we know that Silver's gonna cheat.

your captains will either

12:11.605 --> 12:12.898
[inaudible speech]

12:12.982 --> 12:15.401
-[Robby] What are you doing? Tag Kenny.
-[Kenny] Come on!

12:15.484 --> 12:17.611
[dramatic music continues]

12:19.613 --> 12:20.781
What are you doing?

12:23.743 --> 12:24.869
[referee] Point!

12:24.952 --> 12:26.495
[in Spanish] Animal! Hurry up!

12:27.079 --> 12:29.457
[grunting]

12:30.291 --> 12:31.417
[Miguel in English] Robby.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.918
[dramatic music builds]

12:35.212 --> 12:36.547
[audience gasp]

12:40.176 --> 12:41.927
Point! Winner!

12:42.011 --> 12:44.638
[announcer] Team Pantera
with an impressive victory.

12:44.722 --> 12:49.059
Miyagi-Do's loss puts them on the verge
of elimination after their first match.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.645
Eli, why didn't you tag in Kenny
when you had the chance?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.856
He just got here.
You expect us to trust him?

12:53.939 --> 12:56.275
Trust me to what? Not get my ass kicked
like you and Demetri?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.611
Like you'd do any better
against Spanish Hawk.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.863
You completely disappeared
after the Shittening.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.574
And then you coincidentally come back
the same time as Silver.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.118
-You really want to tag in a mole?
-Are you serious?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.246
I fly here to help us win,
and you won't give me a chance?

13:09.330 --> 13:12.333
Everybody laughed at me in the woods,
but somehow, I'm the bad guy?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.752
He's still pissed.
It makes sense he'd want revenge.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.505
-Say something, you--
-Hey! This isn't about Kenny.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.840
I'm the one who lost the match. Me.

13:22.092 --> 13:22.968
Robby.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.678
[somber music plays]

13:27.181 --> 13:28.390
What the hell was that?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.018
I… I don't know.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.230
Team falling apart
faster than crunchy taco.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.525
We haven't even faced his team yet,
and Silver's already affecting us.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.360
Yeah. Ignoring him isn't working.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.363
He wants to screw with us,

13:43.572 --> 13:45.533
maybe we should screw with him right back.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.868
[tense music plays]

13:47.952 --> 13:49.870
[Kreese] You'd better watch your back.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.125
Maybe use other enemy

13:55.209 --> 13:56.961
to do screwing, hmm?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.255
[tense music crescendos]

14:01.131 --> 14:02.466
Yo, Robby.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.343
What's going on?

14:04.426 --> 14:07.638
You can see what's going on.
I'm completely screwing it up out there.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.932
That's not on you. That was a team loss.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.435
Okay? What's really going on?
What happened while I was away?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.020
A lot.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.815
Tory ended things.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.567
-She hooked up with Kwon.
-What?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.444
Yeah, and then I got drunk
and did something stupid.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
I'm just…
I'm blowing it on and off the mat.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.368
You were right.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.829
You should've been captain.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.747
That's bullshit.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.416
You earned that spot.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.127
You're just in your head right now.
I get it. Who wouldn't be?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.714
But the team is hanging on by a thread.
And we need a leader.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.549
Yeah, I know. But I'm not it.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.134
That's more bullshit. Look.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.846
Robby, you led the charge
for everyone to leave Silver.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.848
You got Kenny to Miyagi-Do.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.143
Like it or not,
you're a natural-born leader.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.354
Okay? You fight for what you believe in,
and you don't give up.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.816
So this whole
"I'm not a leader" thing is… is…

15:01.400 --> 15:02.860
-Bullshit?
-Yes.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.487
So lead us.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.197
And we'll follow.

15:07.823 --> 15:08.657
I'll follow.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.203
Even though I've been acting
like an asshole to you before I left.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.121
It was just…

15:15.080 --> 15:15.915
It wasn't you.

15:16.498 --> 15:17.333
It's okay.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.711
When the time is right,
you're gonna step up.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.504
Like you always do.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.423
Like the leader you are.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
-[Robby] Thanks, man.
-[Miguel] I got you.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.684
What's up, my Karate Squad?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.061
All the way to the quarterfinals,

15:37.144 --> 15:40.773
and the Queen of Karate
is still undefeated.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.399
What's my secret?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.443
All day, I work hard.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.195
But at night,

15:46.278 --> 15:48.280
I play even harder.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.407
Isn't that right, Nichols?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.411
-But we--
-[Tory] It's true.

15:54.495 --> 15:58.040
Zara's secret is she's a two-faced bitch
who doesn't give a shit about her sisters

15:58.123 --> 15:59.708
unless it's to steal their boyfriends.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.752
-Give me that!
-[Kim Da-Eun] Enough!

16:04.213 --> 16:05.089
Leave.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.593
I am tired
of all this off-the-mat nonsense.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.930
You need to focus.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.559
[tense music plays]

16:21.397 --> 16:23.399
[suspenseful music plays]

16:40.749 --> 16:43.460
[Kreese] A gift certificate to the spa.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.255
[tense music crescendos]

16:46.338 --> 16:48.340
[suspenseful music plays]

16:50.592 --> 16:54.013
-Hey! You thieving son of a bitch!
-[man] Whoa, hey!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.180
-Where is it?
-[Wolf] Easy!

16:55.264 --> 16:56.098
[Silver chuckles]

16:56.181 --> 16:58.100
-Where the hell is it?
-[Silver laughs]

16:58.183 --> 17:01.061
I have no idea
what you're even talking about.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.062
Gentlemen!

17:02.146 --> 17:03.522
What the…

17:04.148 --> 17:06.775
The only fighting we allow here
is on the mat.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.153
Do you want me to suspend you?

17:09.236 --> 17:11.530
Our deepest apologies, Mr. Braun.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.365
It will not happen again.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.408
It better not.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.577
You don't wanna see me angry.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.706
When did I become a babysitter?

17:20.789 --> 17:21.915
This isn't over.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.001
I look forward to next time.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.127
[Kim Da-Eun] Go cool off.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.131
[Daniel] Look at that. It's working.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.842
I'm surprised
you went along with the plan.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.053
What would Miyagi think?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.556
Part of defense
is redirecting your opponent's momentum.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.767
Also, dog cage change a man.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.685
-Mm-hmm. Maybe that too.
-[Johnny chuckles]

17:41.769 --> 17:43.771

[announcer] The next match
between Cobra Kai and Tiger Strike

will begin in 15 minutes.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.238
[dramatic music continues]

17:55.365 --> 17:56.658
[referee] Fighters ready. Fight!

17:58.827 --> 17:59.787
Point!

17:59.870 --> 18:01.038
Yeah!

18:01.121 --> 18:03.332
Yoon, tag Nichols.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.000
[tense music plays]

18:05.542 --> 18:06.585
[grunting]

18:06.668 --> 18:09.880
Bad idea.
There's something wrong with your girl.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.549
She doesn't have her head in the game.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.093
She can handle anything.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.886
Yoon. Tag her.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.930
Tory.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.224
[dramatic music plays]

18:23.852 --> 18:25.854
[in Russian] Destroy her, Vlad!

-[Tory groans]
-[referee in English] Tiger Strike, 2-0.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.207
Maybe your fighter needs to pay attention.

[dramatic music continues]

18:55.300 --> 18:56.844
Nichols, focus.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.181
Your heart's not in this. Is it?

[tense music plays]

19:06.520 --> 19:07.437

19:07.521 --> 19:08.647

[suspenseful music plays]

19:11.775 --> 19:13.152
Tiger Strike, winner!

19:13.235 --> 19:14.069
Yeah!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.613
[announcer] Tiger Strike stays alive
with their first win,

19:16.697 --> 19:18.448
while Cobra Kai drops to 1-1.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.450
Another loss, and Cobra Kai is out.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.493
I'm fine. I'm fine!

19:33.630 --> 19:34.631
Mr. Payne.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.885
Glad to see you finally made it.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.846
[tense music plays]

19:41.346 --> 19:42.681
What the hell do you want?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.852
Just to welcome you to your rightful place
at the Sekai Taikai.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.023
Too bad your new dojo
doesn't feel the same.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.444
Based on how they left you out in the cold
in that first match.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.197
Maybe they don't see the champion in you.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.406
I always have.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.075
You know,

20:03.160 --> 20:05.329
with the loopholes in the roster system,

20:06.288 --> 20:08.540
I'd make a spot for you on my team
in a heartbeat.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.125
I, uh…

20:11.877 --> 20:14.338
No. I couldn't do that to the Miyagi-Dos.

20:14.963 --> 20:15.797
Why?

20:17.132 --> 20:18.675
What have they done for you?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.093
Hmm?

20:21.511 --> 20:22.804
Did you come here to win?

20:22.888 --> 20:23.847
What?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.557
My team is undefeated.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.646
You'd have a much better chance
if you were actually on a winning team.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.191
Up to you, young man.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
[tense music plays]

20:41.823 --> 20:44.243
[Daniel] So we need to win this one
to stay in the tournament.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.663
We know it's hard with Silver here,
but we are not fighting his team now.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.165
[Johnny] We've heard this garbage
going around about loyalty.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.501
Almost all of us
trained somewhere else at some point.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.711
What matters is where our asses are now.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.046
We're Miyagi-Do.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.632
-Got it?
-Come on, y'all. Let's go!

20:58.715 --> 21:00.717
[tense music plays]

21:02.094 --> 21:03.595
I saw Kenny talking to Silver.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.472
Are you serious?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.477
[exciting music plays]

21:11.353 --> 21:12.229
[referee] Fight!

21:12.312 --> 21:16.316
[Miguel grunts]

21:16.400 --> 21:17.985
[exciting music continues]

21:22.739 --> 21:23.657
[man] Ais!

21:25.284 --> 21:26.285
It's time.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.203
Okay. You got this.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.372

Ais!

21:32.457 --> 21:34.459
[dramatic music continues]

21:37.754 --> 21:39.339
-Point!
-Yeah!

21:39.423 --> 21:40.382
Let's go!

21:40.465 --> 21:42.676
[dramatic music continues]

21:52.936 --> 21:53.854
Robby, tag me.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.230
No. Over here. Tag me, tag me!

21:55.314 --> 21:57.858
-Tag Kenny!
-Do not tag Kenny. Do not tag him!

21:57.941 --> 21:58.942
[inaudible speech]

22:01.028 --> 22:02.029
[Miguel] So lead us.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.613
And we'll follow.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.699
[uplifting music plays]

22:07.534 --> 22:08.368
Ais!

22:08.452 --> 22:10.412
[uplifting music continues]

22:13.832 --> 22:15.625
-Finally.
-[Robby] Come on, Kenny. Go!

22:15.709 --> 22:17.169
No, no! [groans]

22:17.252 --> 22:19.546
[tense music plays]

22:21.798 --> 22:23.467
[Silver] What have they done for you?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.761
Did you come here to win?

22:27.846 --> 22:29.765
You got this, you got this, you got this.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.391
[exhales slowly]

22:31.475 --> 22:32.309
Ais!

22:32.392 --> 22:34.394
[dramatic music plays]

22:43.695 --> 22:44.988
-Point!
-Yes!

22:45.072 --> 22:46.365
[referee] Miyagi-Do, two.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.325
[yells]

22:48.408 --> 22:49.451
[referee] Another point!

22:49.534 --> 22:50.952
Miyagi-Do wins!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.871
-Yes!
-Let's go!

22:52.954 --> 22:54.373
-Yes!
-That's badass!

22:55.707 --> 22:57.042
Dude, what the hell, man?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.004
-Let's go! Come on!
-Whoo!

23:01.838 --> 23:04.341
[announcer] With the win,
Miyagi-Do moves to 1-1.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.594
If they win their next match, they advance
to the tournament of champions.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.346
Come on, baby!

23:10.097 --> 23:10.931
Let's go!

23:11.431 --> 23:12.474
Good job, captain.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.110

[kids] Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

23:26.738 --> 23:29.074
-[Kenny] Yeah!
-[Miguel] Yes!

23:31.243 --> 23:32.202
[exhales happily]

23:34.788 --> 23:37.499
I know it was you
who stole Kreese's eunjangdo.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.794
Put it back.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.089
-You confuse me for thief.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.550
Don't you know what you've done?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.845
Kreese is like dynamite
waiting to explode.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.889
And that blast can easily
be directed your way.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.224
Is that a threat?

23:54.307 --> 23:55.725
It's a warning.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.813
I'd hate for you to make another… mistake.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.315
[announcer] After the break,
our final round.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.235
First match, Miyagi-Do versus Cobra Kai.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.529
I would hurry.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.698
You don't have much time.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.175
[Robby] Come on, guys.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.928
We beat Cobra Kai before.
We can do it again.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.473
One more time.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.976
Let's send our captains into the finals.

24:38.768 --> 24:39.936
One last time.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.149
Win or lose,

24:45.567 --> 24:48.195
this is the last time
we'll ever fight together as a team.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.449
Damn. I guess
I never thought about it like that.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.035
After everything we've been through,
this is…

24:56.036 --> 24:57.162
This is it. [chuckles]

25:01.666 --> 25:02.501
So?

25:04.544 --> 25:05.712
How do we wanna go out?

Eli?

25:17.432 --> 25:18.517
Dude.

25:21.394 --> 25:22.354
I'm really sorry.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.691
I… I didn't mean to hurt you.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.653
Oh, I… I know you didn't. I…

25:31.655 --> 25:33.240
I'm just scared of losing my best friend.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.285
I'm gonna miss you so much, man.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.703
Yeah.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.206
But you'll always be my brother.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.749
[gentle music continues]

25:46.753 --> 25:47.921
Okay, that's enough.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.091
There's no crying in karate.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.342
[Sam and Devon laugh]

25:54.177 --> 25:57.097
-Come on. Come in here, boys.

gonna be my brothers too.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.811
[gentle music continues]

26:04.479 --> 26:05.438
We're a family.

26:06.898 --> 26:07.774
All of us.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.568
[gentle music continues]

26:17.325 --> 26:18.326
Who are we?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.120
[all] Miyagi-Do.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.247
Who are we?

26:22.956 --> 26:24.624
[all] Miyagi-Do!

26:24.708 --> 26:26.751
-[Robby] Who are we?
-[all shouting] Miyagi-Do!

26:26.835 --> 26:28.378
I said who are we?

26:28.461 --> 26:32.132
[all] Miyagi-Do! Miyagi-Do!

26:32.215 --> 26:34.134
-Yeah!
-[Devon] Whoo!

26:35.468 --> 26:40.015
You know, we did have one real doozy
of an inspirational speech planned.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.517
Looks like you guys beat us to it.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.437
Our senseis taught us well.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.316
All right. Enough of this kumbaya crap.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.778
It's time to get out there
and kick some Cobra Kai ass!

26:53.862 --> 26:55.071
[all] Yeah!

26:55.697 --> 26:56.781
Let's go!

26:57.574 --> 27:00.327
[announcer] Because both Miyagi-Do
and Cobra Kai are one and one,

27:00.410 --> 27:02.662
whoever wins this match advances.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.957
And whoever loses is eliminated.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.043
[tense music plays]

27:09.878 --> 27:13.340
Defeat does not exist in this dojo.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.675
Does it?

27:17.677 --> 27:19.471
No, Sensei.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.223
Good.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.730
Is the Keene boy
why you've been fighting so poorly?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.398
Yeah, I know what you're gonna say.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.859
"Forget about the boy.
He's just a distraction."

27:34.611 --> 27:35.445
No.

Whatever he's making you feel…

27:39.240 --> 27:41.159
Confusion, heartache,

27:41.910 --> 27:43.078
anger.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.288
…feel all of it.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.332
And then use it.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.753
What? You think you're the first girl
that's ever been hurt by a boy?

27:53.463 --> 27:55.840
We can let them get away with it,

27:56.883 --> 27:59.344
or we can make them pay.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.429
[suspenseful music plays]

28:02.013 --> 28:06.601
All right. Remember, trust, tag, teamwork.

I said pause,
not hook up with our enemies.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.933
So it's okay to hook up
with your new teammates then?
