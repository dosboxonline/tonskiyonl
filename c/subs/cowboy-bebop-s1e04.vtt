["I'll Touch A Star" playing]

00:43.668 --> 00:46.504
Hello, my name is Ivana.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.093
Hello, my name is Laura.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.054
Laura.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.223
Hello, my name is Kathy.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.309
[sighs]

01:00.101 --> 01:02.645
Kathy. Kathy?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.773
Kathy. Kathy. No.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.372
Hello, my name is X1-2345SSY.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.973
Hello, my name is Faye Valentine, which,
if you're asking, isn't my real name.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.892
It's the fake one you gave me.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.436
Sorry, do I know you?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.314
No, but I know you, Mark.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.485
Friendless, pasty, opera-loving… virgin?

01:50.568 --> 01:51.903
[chuckles uncomfortably]

01:51.986 --> 01:53.029
I'm not a…

01:54.114 --> 01:56.407
I'm sorry, what exactly is this about?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.160
You prematurely
waking up cryo-frozen amnesiacs

01:59.244 --> 02:01.371
and then stealing their settlement money.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.374
Uh, look, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.708
Oh, yeah? Bam!

02:08.837 --> 02:13.508
That's your signature, Mark Manley.
You gave the go-ahead to defrost my ass.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.512
Look, I'm sorry, uh, Miss Valentine.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.222
If you've been suffering from amnesia,

02:19.305 --> 02:22.016
but it's a known side-effect
of long-term cryo sleep.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.728
You targeted me.
Knew I'd wake up all scared and confused.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.023
"Who am I? What happened?"
How do you sleep at night?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.942
Look, you need to talk
to one of our attorneys.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.861
-I'm sure that they can help.
-Yeah?

02:33.528 --> 02:34.946
-[Marley] Ooh.
-[Faye] Meet my lawyer.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.072
[gasps]

02:37.991 --> 02:39.868
-Okay, what do you want from me?
-You?

02:40.451 --> 02:43.079
Very little. I know
you're just the inside man.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.998
I want the bitch who took my Identikit.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.791
What? They never gave you your kit?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.293
No, asshole.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.462
They gave her all my belongings
before they woke me up.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.007
So you're going
to call Whitney Haggis Matsumoto,

02:54.090 --> 02:56.676
the bitch you let con me
into thinking she was my mother…

02:57.260 --> 02:58.303
[whimpers]

02:58.386 --> 03:01.055
You're gonna tell her
you've found another amnesiac to scam,

03:01.139 --> 03:02.640
and that you want to meet with her.

03:03.141 --> 03:03.975
[hesitating] I…

03:04.058 --> 03:06.186
Do it, or so help me God,

03:06.269 --> 03:07.979
I'm going to shoot your dick off.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.733
Because a girl
with no memory's got nothing to lose.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.528
-Yep.
-Yep, let's move it.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.492
Hey, it's Manley.

03:22.577 --> 03:27.123
Yeah, I got a really big fish here,
ready to defrost. Um, you hungry?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.460
-[man 1] Get down! Shut the fuck up!
-[people screaming]

03:30.543 --> 03:33.087
[woman 1] Everyone on the ground now!

03:33.171 --> 03:36.633
-You too, sweetheart!
-Okay, take it easy.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.637
[woman 1] She's over there.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.513
[whimpers]

03:42.597 --> 03:45.642
Oh, my God, Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, what are we going to do?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.101
[hesitating] What's going on?
What are we doing?

03:47.185 --> 03:49.145
Shut the fuck up and keep your head down.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.230
I don't want to die.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.273
-I said no talking, Bow-Tie!
-[Faye] No!

03:52.357 --> 03:54.567
No, no, no! Gimme the phone! No!

03:55.693 --> 03:57.487
-[Faye grunts]
-[woman 1] Stay down!

03:59.280 --> 04:00.990
That goes for the rest of you too!

04:22.053 --> 04:24.222
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.350
We are the Callisto Liberation Front.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.895
Eco soldiers and space warriors.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.440
Fighting to return the colonies
back to Mother Nature.

04:35.858 --> 04:39.696
Miss Cadena. CEO of Kao Construction.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
While you enjoy a night at the opera,

04:42.949 --> 04:48.496
your company is preparing to destroy
thousands of acres of forest on Callisto.

04:49.414 --> 04:54.127
Life! And you intend
to replace it all with steel and concrete.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.547
To build your cities,
and fill them with people.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.383
That's the whole point of terraforming.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.594
Silence! Your company
is a plague upon nature.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.097
Directly responsible for the recent

05:06.180 --> 05:09.809
and ruthless extinction
of the Ganymede Sea Rat.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.645
Ugh, environmentalists are the worst.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.189
Your reckoning has arrived.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.571
Wha… What?

05:22.447 --> 05:24.615
-You were supposed to have it.
-[woman 1] I did--

05:24.699 --> 05:26.784
-Shut your lips!
-[man 1] You're such a Howard.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.745
-[woman 1] You're a Howard.
-What?

05:28.828 --> 05:31.873
-Christ on a bike!
-[man 2] I got it. I got it.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.916
[people gasping, whimpering]

05:35.835 --> 05:41.424
Inside this pod are the same spores
used to terraform Callisto.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.010
Now you will see, Miss Cadena,

05:44.093 --> 05:48.014
the fate that awaits you all
if my demands are not met.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.892
Stop construction on Callisto

05:51.976 --> 05:56.606
or we return Marvis
and Salt City back to nature.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.443
Let's have
a little demonstration, shall we?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.320
Pollinate him.

06:03.071 --> 06:03.946
[grunts]

06:04.030 --> 06:06.032
[lilting music playing]

06:16.292 --> 06:17.335
-[man 2] Oh, boy.
-[woman 2] Where is it?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.755
Where is it? Find it!

06:20.838 --> 06:23.674
-[man 1] Where did it go?
-Find it!

06:23.758 --> 06:24.801
[woman 1] There!

06:37.146 --> 06:38.231
[inhales deeply]

06:42.318 --> 06:44.320
[crowd gasping]

06:47.031 --> 06:49.033
[screaming]

06:50.118 --> 06:51.160
What?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.373
-[woman 2] No, no!
-[all groaning]

07:12.598 --> 07:14.642
No! [grunts in frustration]

07:15.601 --> 07:16.769
You morons.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.354
We needed her!

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
[people continue screaming]

07:22.984 --> 07:24.861
Holy shit.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.785
[woman 1] We've got to go!

07:32.869 --> 07:34.203
-[men clamoring]
-[woman 1] Go, go, go!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.373
[Faye] No.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.710
-[grunts]
-[man 2] Come on, this way!

07:52.263 --> 07:55.349
No, no, no! That's my ship!
That's my ship!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.851
You shit stains!

08:00.813 --> 08:02.148
No, no, no!

08:09.280 --> 08:11.282
Oh, balls!

08:11.365 --> 08:13.451
[opening theme music playing]

09:45.459 --> 09:47.086
[peppy music playing]

09:55.553 --> 09:57.013
You figure out what you want?

09:59.223 --> 10:00.474
[Spike] Um…

10:00.558 --> 10:01.684
[Jet groans tiredly]

10:02.768 --> 10:03.603
[Jet] Hmm.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.982
I can't eat this shit.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.150
Jeez.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.777
You're picky for someone
who hates eating peppers all the time.

10:11.861 --> 10:12.862
-Miss.
-[waitress] Hmm?

10:12.945 --> 10:16.324
The popcorn shrimp.
Is it shrimp-shrimp or fake shrimp?

10:16.407 --> 10:19.076
It's an algae-soy hybrid.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.413
Okay. We'll just get the potato skins.
And you still have that 2-for-1 deal?

10:22.496 --> 10:25.124
-With a coupon.
-Okay. Two rib-eye dinners.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.043
Coupon doesn't apply to real meat.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.712
You sure it's real
and not an algae-soy hybrid?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.547
[waitress] That's what it says
on the package.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.550
But it's not like I met
the cows before they brained them,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.677
drained them and chopped them up,
so what do I know?

10:36.761 --> 10:40.181
Then just make it
the Io Tuna-Rib dinner for two.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.140
[waitress] Mmm-hmm.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.769
-That comes with free cheesy bread, right?
-All you can eat, hon.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.728
Okay.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.815
Look at you, big spender.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.943
Recklessly throwing
petty cash caution to the wind.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.070
We'll make it up.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.657
Look, we deserve it.
We haven't had a fancy meal in weeks.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.283
[laughs] Fancy?

10:59.367 --> 11:02.244
Ah, look at you. Actually smiling.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.039
Yeah, probably at the prospect
of unlimited fake cheesy bread.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.208
Yeah, well, whatever it is, I'll take it.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.086
Your brooding the last couple of weeks
has been getting on my nerves.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.590
Ah. I love this place.
You know they have bidets in the bathroom?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.508
[Spike] Mmm.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.177
Damned things are addictive.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.848
-Tell me you're talking about the bread.
-Bidets. Quite therapeutic.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.558
You know, that gentle warm water

11:24.642 --> 11:27.728
really eases the stress
while washing out the nooks and crannies.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.230
Stop. I'm begging you.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.607
Next big score,
I'm getting one for the ship.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.068
Maybe two. One for each foot.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.111
Foot?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.948
Jet, a bidet is a toilet
that cleans out your asshole.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.909
What?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.579
[objects clattering]

11:45.663 --> 11:46.622
You guys are so lucky…

11:46.706 --> 11:47.832
-Oh.
-… that I ran into you.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.166
-Oh, no.
-Do you mind?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.796
-Ugh. What is that?
-Water.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.548
Ugh. Oh, beer, thank God.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.425
-Please, help yourself.
-[Faye] Mmm.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.178
Okay.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.056
[exhales]
So the craziest thing just happened.

12:04.140 --> 12:08.102
I was at the opera house
when three eco-dicks in gas masks

12:08.185 --> 12:11.105
stormed in and released this gas
that starts turning people into trees.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.816
No shit! Trees! It was nutbags.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.068
I'll tell you what else is nutbags.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.653
[Faye] Right. Now.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.196
Soon as this hits the news,

12:19.280 --> 12:22.408
every cowboy in the solar system
is going to be after these assholes.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.202
But I got the jump on them.
On account that they took my ship.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.955
Which they stole.
And which I can totally track.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.875
I just need a ride.
It's a real boom-bang-bang.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.840
It's a milk run. It's a cakewalk.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.925
It's a few hours, make some easy Woo. So…

12:40.009 --> 12:41.051
[inhales]

12:41.135 --> 12:43.929
What do you say, fellas,
you want to team up?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.600
-She's high, right?
-You see the bags under her eyes.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.852
-Right.
-Venus Stardust would be my guess.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.021
I'm not high, dickwads!
I'm telling the truth.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.898
Only Cosmic Crank
makes you sweat like that.

12:53.981 --> 12:54.857
True.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.775
[female newscaster] This just in.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.736
Eco-terrorists have
unleashed a chemical weapon

12:58.819 --> 13:00.738
inside the Salt City Opera House.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.034
According to eyewitness reports,
the toxic gas turned people into…

13:07.244 --> 13:08.120
Trees?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.206
Are you serious with this?

13:10.831 --> 13:12.917
Oh, shit, that's nutbags.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.545
I was thinking a 60-40 split.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.631
Going my way, of course.

13:25.763 --> 13:30.476
What is the one thing I specifically told
the three of you not to do

13:30.559 --> 13:31.685
no matter what?

13:32.269 --> 13:35.564
-[together] Kill the CEO.
-Kill the CEO.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.236
So, because she's dead,
hence no messenger for our message…

13:41.070 --> 13:42.655
I had to phone in our demands

13:42.738 --> 13:45.699
to the Kao Construction
headquarters main line.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.993
They put me on hold!

13:48.661 --> 13:49.620
It was mortifying.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.871
-Sorry, Mother.
-Sorry, Ma.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.541
All because you bungled the situation.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.668
Look at me.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.254
Don't you want to make your mother happy?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.464
I do. I d-- [gasps]

14:04.385 --> 14:06.846
Then what have I been
telling you all these years?

14:07.555 --> 14:08.889
You have to be like me.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.141
You have to be smart.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.728
You need to be ruthless.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.772
-You need to be willing to--
-[cell phone ringing]

14:19.233 --> 14:20.150
Sorry.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.738
Mom, it's not mine.

14:24.822 --> 14:25.739
Whose is it then?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.616
She took it off the hostage.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.326
You took a hostage?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.578
He's on the ship.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.080
Why would you take a hostage?

14:33.163 --> 14:34.582
[both] Well, Harrison told us to.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.250
No, they're lying. I…

14:37.042 --> 14:38.252
[sighs]

14:38.335 --> 14:40.963
-[Harrison] I'm sorry, Mother.
-Well…

14:42.548 --> 14:45.593
While you three
were playing Keystone Criminals,

14:45.676 --> 14:48.721
I found the missiles
we need to complete our plan.

14:48.804 --> 14:49.847
-Awesome.
-That's great.

14:49.930 --> 14:54.768
Grab anything of value,
we are wheels up in ten minutes.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.981
Hey, where are we
going to get the missiles?

15:00.107 --> 15:02.234
-Your father.
-Oh, boy.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.486
What should I do with the hostage?

15:04.570 --> 15:09.074
[Maria] Just ask yourself,
"What would Mother do?"

15:11.076 --> 15:12.494
[sighs]

15:19.418 --> 15:20.294
[Jet] Maria Murdock.

15:20.377 --> 15:24.465
Trespassing, resisting arrest,
defacing private property.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.550
Run-of-the-mill eco-fasch shit.

15:26.634 --> 15:31.013
[Spike] Graduated to full-on mass murder
with a 25 million price tag.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.642
Kao Construction
has 12 hours, well, make that 11,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.477
before she pulls the plug on Callisto.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.228
Ah, shit.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.441
-Ah, shit.
-[Jet] Got a first-aid kit.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.984
I could clean that up for you.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.820
-It's fine.
-Looks pretty bad.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.324
-It's a graze.
-She remind you of somebody?

15:54.286 --> 15:55.829
-The Cosmonaut.
-Thank you.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.498
[laughs]

15:57.581 --> 15:58.666
Tonking on Bobo.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.335
Hell of a night, huh?

16:01.418 --> 16:03.629
-Technically, morning.
-[both laugh]

16:03.712 --> 16:05.297
-What?
-[Spike] Nothing.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.216
-[Jet sighs]
-[Spike] Nothing. [chuckles]

16:07.299 --> 16:09.009
How about you take us to the Murdocks?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.970
Yeah, I'm tracking them now, Skinny.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.056
Okay, so we can intercept them
at Mars, and then…

16:14.932 --> 16:16.558
What the shit is that?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.105
[Spike] That's a dog. You never seen one?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.565
[laughs in delight]

16:23.649 --> 16:25.776
Sure, in zoos.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.530
Next to the dragon sanctuary
and unicorn exhibit.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.199
I hear these things
are, like, 20-30 million a pop.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.701
He's not for sale.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.788
I hear they're pretty tasty too.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.581
[Jet] He's not for eating.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.128
Jet, can I speak to you
in the cockpit for a minute?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.089
You stay there.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.301
You're an ugly little fella, aren't you?

16:51.385 --> 16:52.594
[panting]

16:54.179 --> 16:56.056
Kind of weird
she's never seen a dog before, right?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.891
Yeah, right?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.018
No, listen.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.853
You really want to work with that nut-job?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.855
Relax, she'll get us Murdock.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.440
Right, like she got us Asimov.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.901
Wait, no, she got Asimov shot
in the neck and almost got me killed.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.529
She screwed us then
and she's going to screw us now.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.864
I don't think we can trust her.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.782
I'm giving her
the benefit of the doubt, Spike.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.826
Why? Why? Give me one good reason.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.619
How about 25 million of 'em?

17:17.703 --> 17:20.372
Look, we'll get the coordinates from her,
punch them in and then--

17:20.456 --> 17:21.373
No need.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.460
We have the coordinates right here.
We get the Murdocks on our own.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.586
[rumbling]

17:25.669 --> 17:27.546
Now who's doing the screwing?

17:27.629 --> 17:29.506
-Don't. Don't.
-[thudding]

17:29.590 --> 17:30.466
What is that?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.305
That's my ship.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.683
Maybe it serves you right.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.853
My dog!

17:42.936 --> 17:44.730
[mouthing] Fuck you, fuckers.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.360
You read lips, what did she say?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.361
Serves you right.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.117
[Faye grunts]

17:57.201 --> 17:58.577
How do I turn off the tracker?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.664
Uh-huh.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.876
You smarty little fuzzy pants.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.044
Maybe I won't eat you.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.463
Maybe I'll sell you
for a buttload of Woos, huh?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.841
Ugh, your breath smells like a buttload.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.145
[piano playing]

18:41.161 --> 18:42.162
[door opens]

18:44.123 --> 18:45.040
[door closes]

18:47.835 --> 18:49.545
Thank you for the chocolates.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.548
[Vicious] Tui's going to take you
off-planet for a few days.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.384
What? Why?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.261
The Elders.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.429
What they made me do to you.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.225
In my own house.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.980
That will never happen again.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.690
I am making certain of it.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.776
[Julia] What's going on?

19:14.069 --> 19:16.029
I have gathered my lieutenants.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.489
They're bringing men.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.992
And firepower.

19:20.075 --> 19:23.745
I am going to burn
the Elders' temple to the ground.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.372
Once they're dead…

19:27.916 --> 19:29.585
you won't have to be afraid.

19:31.336 --> 19:35.257
If you declare war and it doesn't work,

19:37.134 --> 19:38.802
there's no place for us to hide.

19:41.096 --> 19:41.930
[Vicious] Leave us.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.268
[door opens]

19:47.186 --> 19:49.021
What would you suggest?

19:49.104 --> 19:50.564
[door closes]

19:50.647 --> 19:52.941
Come at them from the side, perhaps,

19:54.443 --> 19:55.652
instead of the front.

19:56.278 --> 20:01.283
A coup rather than a war.
You could get the other Capos to join you.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.911
Take on the Elders as a united front.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.164
The Eunuch is weak,
he'd never turn on them.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.917
Oh, but, Mao…

20:12.169 --> 20:15.881
she is power-hungry.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.966
[grave music playing]

20:20.010 --> 20:21.261
That she is.

20:22.346 --> 20:26.350
And you always say…
The Eunuch falls in line with her.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.269
Like a fawning bitch.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.687
[gasps]

20:34.191 --> 20:36.109
It's a tricky proposition.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.029
Mao is no fool.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.575
It's just a suggestion.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.039
But if anyone can outwit Mao…

20:53.293 --> 20:54.169
it's you.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.474
-[amusing instrumental music playing]
-[Ein barking]

21:22.197 --> 21:24.741
[Faye] Oh, that's rude. Manley?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.368
Please, please, please be in there.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.328
[Ein barking]

21:30.998 --> 21:33.667
[in sing-song voice] Manley,
I need that phone of yours.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.429
Bad dog! Shh!

21:45.512 --> 21:47.014
[laughs]

21:47.097 --> 21:49.850
Karma is a bitch!

21:49.933 --> 21:51.768
Now, if you don't mind,

21:52.352 --> 21:55.605
I'll be relieving you of your phone

21:55.689 --> 21:59.609
and any, ugh, loose change you might have…

22:00.402 --> 22:01.236
Okay.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.656
All right.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.118
Whitney, I'm coming for you.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.328
-[squelching]
-Ugh.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.871
What is that?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.668
Ugh.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.669
Rats.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.464
Rats is right.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.966
Spike, we talked about this.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.928
That was before I saw her lying,
cheating, stealing face again.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.263
-[Faye sighs]
-Do not shoot her.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.098
-Please.
-No!

22:32.059 --> 22:34.811
I disabled the ship's tracker.
How did you even find me?

22:34.895 --> 22:37.647
You disabled a tracker,
not all the trackers.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.649
Spike's real protective of his ship.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.444
Please, I just want to
kill her a little bit.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.821
God damn it, Spike.
How many times have I got to tell you?

22:44.905 --> 22:45.781
Stow it.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.950
-You're done.
-[Faye grunts]

22:49.534 --> 22:50.660
Feels tight.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.247
Dead ringer for the Cosmonaut
just then. Am I right?

22:54.331 --> 22:57.042
-[Jet laughing] In the eyebrows?
-[Spike] In the eyebrows.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.586
[laughing] Yes! It's the eyebrows.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.088
[Faye laughs mockingly]

23:02.089 --> 23:04.633
Yeah, okay, dickholes. So what?

23:04.716 --> 23:07.219
Are you going to turn me in to ISSP?

23:07.302 --> 23:08.428
No.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.099
-Are you going to airlock me?
-Ooh, I second that motion.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.394
Why would I fix your shoulder
just to throw you out the airlock, huh?

23:15.477 --> 23:16.395
I don't know.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.731
Because maybe you two are a bunch
of bored, sadistic sons of bitches.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.108
Wow.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.318
She's not wrong.
I've been pretty bored lately.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.490
So, if you're not going to airlock me,

23:28.573 --> 23:32.035
what kind of sick, perverted shit
are you two planning to do?

23:34.371 --> 23:35.288
Eat.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.291
It's not poisoned.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.876
[Spike] Whoa, whoa!

23:39.960 --> 23:42.879
She lies to us, she steals my ship,
and now you're feeding her?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.339
You're feeding the Cosmonaut?

23:44.423 --> 23:48.760
We need her. The Murdocks
are a crew of four well-armed criminals.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.805
We have a better shot
of bringing them in if we work together.

23:51.888 --> 23:52.722
Hold on--

23:52.806 --> 23:54.516
Before you give me the spit-and-whistle

23:54.599 --> 23:58.603
that I'm not thinking straight, just take
a deep breath and admit to yourself.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.813
You know I'm right.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.361
Fine, but that 60-40 split
is now in our favor.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.865
Only if you tell me who the Cosmonaut is.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.241
Seventy-thirty.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.034
Fine.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.578
Jesus.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.205
So how do we find the Murdocks?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.040
[sighs]

24:20.333 --> 24:21.626
I don't know. I wish I did.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.753
You were there
when they attacked the opera house.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.131
-You got into fisticuffs with them.
-So?

24:26.214 --> 24:29.176
So, you got close enough
to hear or see something.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.096
Name? Location?

24:33.180 --> 24:36.266
How they plan to deliver
their atmo-pods of death?

24:36.349 --> 24:37.934
You've got to give us something.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.020
[rock music playing]

25:01.875 --> 25:04.461
Now feel those notes nibbling your neck.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.050
That's it, kitten.

25:12.636 --> 25:17.057
Now feel the key to F,
just stroke up your thighs…

25:28.151 --> 25:30.946
Deeper. Deeper.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.117
-Deeper.
-Any deeper and you'll break her in half.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.205
Still trying to protect
the talent from my perfection.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.790
I wouldn't dream of it.

25:42.749 --> 25:43.750
[Gren speaks indistinctly]

25:45.502 --> 25:46.836
Couldn't stop you, even if I tried.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.922
No, you couldn't, you scoundrel.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.132
She's waiting on you.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.387
Be nice. She's not a marionette.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.692
[Ana] Well, look who's becoming a regular.

26:10.151 --> 26:10.986
Drink?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.446
No, thank you.

26:14.739 --> 26:15.782
A favor.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.452
Try me.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.959
Would you consider
reaching out to Mao Yenrai

26:27.127 --> 26:29.838
to arrange a sit-down
with her and Vicious?

26:30.922 --> 26:34.759
Now, I know you don't get involved
in Syndicate business, ever.

26:35.885 --> 26:36.928
-But--
-You're right.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.555
I don't.

26:39.889 --> 26:40.932
Ever.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.643
What are you getting yourself into?

26:44.477 --> 26:46.563
It's the only way for me to be safe.

26:46.646 --> 26:50.609
And how will this meeting
with Mao help you do that?

26:55.655 --> 26:57.616
It's better for you if you don't know.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.704
[lively music playing]

27:08.960 --> 27:11.087
[Faye] So we're going to go talk
to a guy named Howard

27:11.171 --> 27:12.756
just because I overheard
one of the Murdocks

27:12.839 --> 27:15.592
call the other one out
for being "such a Howard"?

27:15.675 --> 27:18.219
It seems like kind of a reach,
don't you think?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.388
I mean, if one calls
the other a douchebag,

27:20.472 --> 27:23.141
are we gonna go storm
the feminine hygiene aisle of a pharmacy?

27:23.224 --> 27:24.893
It's called following a lead.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.146
Public records list Howard Culpepper
as Maria Murdock's ex-husband.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.649
He also happens
to work for Kao Construction.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.110
We find Howard, maybe we get
a mainline on Maria's location.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.278
I need my gun.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.072
-No way.
-Absolutely not.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.698
How am I supposed to defend myself?

27:38.782 --> 27:41.660
They're terra farmers. What are they
gonna do, plough you to death?

27:57.967 --> 27:59.260
[Jet] Found Howard.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.971
Poor bastard slept with the wrong skirt.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.848
[alarm blaring]

28:05.934 --> 28:07.644
-Now can I have my gun?
-[both] No!

28:11.981 --> 28:15.652
Just relax, it's only four of them.
Like you said, boom-bang-bang.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.154
Emphasis on "boom."

28:24.285 --> 28:26.413
[Maria] Hurry up, get the pods loaded!

28:26.496 --> 28:27.956
I'll prep our ship.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.709
We've got to shut those missiles down.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.794
-Yeah. Wait, what? I…
-Yeah.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.255
I thought we were going
after the cash money?

28:35.338 --> 28:36.881
Forget about Maria, Spike.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.299
If those rockets go airborne,

28:38.383 --> 28:41.177
six million people are going
to be turned into weeping willows.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.305
[exhales] That is not going to be
a pretty sight, believe you me.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.265
No.

28:45.890 --> 28:46.808
Fine.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.059
We'll do the right thing.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.227
We'll nab the bounty.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.478
We'll stop the missiles.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.855
Bounty's mine.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.857
[Spike] Why does she
get to have all the fun?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.411
[both grunting]

29:28.433 --> 29:30.101
She's almost loaded! You ready?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.102
[beeping]

29:31.186 --> 29:33.188
Initiating launch sequence.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.608
[beeps]

29:39.444 --> 29:40.403
Let's stay low.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.157
[both continue grunting]

29:59.672 --> 30:01.549
[groans]

30:03.009 --> 30:04.427
Shit!

30:20.401 --> 30:21.236
Shit.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.114
[alarm continues blaring]

30:25.198 --> 30:26.032
Mommy?

30:26.699 --> 30:27.534
Mom.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.078
Where are you going?

30:33.414 --> 30:34.415
[beeping]

30:57.105 --> 30:58.565
She'd better bring her back.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.692
She will. Come on.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.402
[thrilling instrumental music playing]

31:13.496 --> 31:15.498
[cell phone ringing]

31:24.632 --> 31:25.592
[Whitney over phone] Hello? Mark?

31:26.175 --> 31:27.719
[in deep voice] Uh, hey.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.345
Ugh. I can barely hear you.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.140
[mimicking static]
All right, I can hear you.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.392
So, your offer. I'm in.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.729
Yeah, that's cool. Where are you?

31:38.646 --> 31:40.356
I'm at Praga, in Alba City.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.234
Uh, Praga?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.070
Yeah. Hands down
the best borscht in the solar system.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.032
[mimics static]
Cool, great, I'll see you there.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.200
Lovely. When you get here, we need to…

31:55.413 --> 31:57.415
[alarm blaring]

32:14.641 --> 32:15.475
[laughs]

32:16.017 --> 32:18.394
Think the bounty on these clowns
will get me those bidets?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.897
-God, I hope not.
-[automated voice] Warning!

32:20.980 --> 32:24.192
-[Jet] Shit! Shit.
-Five, four, three, two…

32:27.278 --> 32:29.322
[beeping]

32:29.989 --> 32:31.741
Useless idiots!

32:31.824 --> 32:33.368
Get out of the way, girl.

32:34.494 --> 32:38.122
Mama's got one more rabbit in her hat.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.584
[thrilling instrumental music playing]

32:48.967 --> 32:51.636
[Whitney] I'm glad we're going
to have a proper sit-down.

32:51.719 --> 32:56.182
We really do need to discuss
the financials of our arrangement.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.978
Your finder's fee is a bit excessive.
Wouldn't you agree, Mark?

33:00.061 --> 33:03.231
Given that I do assume most of the risk.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.857
Just a minute. Mal'chik.

33:04.941 --> 33:08.152
[in Russian] Can you bring us
another round of martinis?

33:08.236 --> 33:10.780
Tsar's select, no vermouth,
shaken and up with three olives.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.742
[in English] Where were we? Oh.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.411
-Yes, shrinking your fee.
-Balls!

33:16.494 --> 33:17.787
Wait, who is this?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.039
[in deep voice] It's Manley.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.833
Bullshit! Who is this?

33:21.916 --> 33:24.502
[in normal voice] Bitch, you know
who this is! This is your worst nightmare!

33:24.585 --> 33:26.337
Faye? Is that you?

33:26.421 --> 33:29.173
Darling heart, I've missed you.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.802
Kudos for finding me,
but mama's got to chew and screw. Bye-bye.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.554
Shit, fuck, shit!

33:36.723 --> 33:38.141
[rumbling]

33:41.310 --> 33:42.395
This day is the worst.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.233
[panting]

33:51.988 --> 33:53.656
What the hell is she doing?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.536
Pretty sure she's saving our asses.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.246
[alarm beeping]

34:01.914 --> 34:04.625
[automated voice] Warning.
Warning. Warning.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.211
Warning. Warning. Warning.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.844
[music fades]

34:14.927 --> 34:16.804
[alarm blaring]

34:16.888 --> 34:19.057
[Faye gasping] Oh, God!

34:22.518 --> 34:24.687
[somber music playing]

34:27.440 --> 34:29.317
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit!

34:32.403 --> 34:33.654
[device beeps]

34:33.738 --> 34:36.574
This is for the lucky pervert
who finds my body.

34:36.657 --> 34:40.912
My cryo-ID number is X1-2345SSY.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.251
Oh, fuck it.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.961
I'm Faye Valentine.

34:50.296 --> 34:51.631
My name is Faye Valentine.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.884
My name is Faye Valentine.
My name is Faye Valentine.

34:56.135 --> 35:00.348
My name is Faye Valentine.
[echoing] Faye Valentine. Faye Valentine.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.490
[Maria grunts in frustration]

35:17.573 --> 35:18.658
No!

35:19.700 --> 35:20.576
[Harrison] Mom?

35:23.329 --> 35:24.747
What do we do now?

35:25.373 --> 35:26.415
We wither.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.001
[sighs in defeat]

35:30.878 --> 35:32.213
When I was a child,

35:33.047 --> 35:38.386
I would climb the tallest tree
I could find and stay up there forever.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.348
It was my idea of heaven.

35:43.808 --> 35:47.353
And now they're going
to send me to prison.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.065
Send both of us.

35:51.983 --> 35:57.280
Together for the rest of our lives
in a 12-foot cell.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.327
I'm sorry,

36:04.078 --> 36:08.332
but there is no way I'm gonna be trapped
in a tiny box with you.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.670
Harrison, what are you doing?

36:14.755 --> 36:15.798
[chuckles]

36:16.883 --> 36:18.676
Making Mother happy.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.137
-No!
-Being ruthless.

36:22.013 --> 36:22.972
No!

36:23.055 --> 36:24.056
[hissing]

36:24.849 --> 36:26.350
[screams] No!

36:34.150 --> 36:36.152
[slurping]

36:44.243 --> 36:45.536
-[Ein whines]
-[grunts in disgust]

36:46.245 --> 36:48.456
Ugh. Shit-licker, off, get off me.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.457
[Ein whimpers]

36:50.458 --> 36:52.543
-Ah, shit.
-Finally.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.089
I was starting to think
you might not wake up.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.718
We followed the smoke trail.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.804
Yeah. You're lucky to be alive.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.432
My ship?

37:06.515 --> 37:07.475
Oh, that's toast.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.519
Hope there wasn't anything valuable on it.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.523
No, nothing. [scoffs]

37:15.149 --> 37:16.817
Just my entire life.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.282
You know what's cool
about losing your life?

37:24.700 --> 37:26.077
You get to build a new one.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.830
[sighs]

37:29.914 --> 37:32.667
-Thanks for finding me.
-Oh, don't thank me.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.585
I bet you were a goner.

37:35.753 --> 37:39.465
But Jet said looking for you
was the least we could do. So…

37:41.467 --> 37:42.468
[sniffs]

37:43.344 --> 37:45.638
Is this your way of saying thank you?

37:47.348 --> 37:49.809
When I want to say thank you,
I'll say thank you.

37:50.977 --> 37:54.105
-[scoffs] Such a dick.
-[Spike] Listen, um…

37:54.188 --> 37:56.274
Jet says you can stay here on the Bebop.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.819
Temporarily. Till you
get your shit together.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.281
We're going for drinks when he gets back.
New guy buys the first round.

38:04.740 --> 38:06.242
-Hey, Spike.
-Yep.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.413
Okay, just for real,

38:11.998 --> 38:14.041
who is the Cosmonaut?

38:19.463 --> 38:20.756
Welcome to the Bebop.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.052
[Spike chuckles]

38:25.136 --> 38:26.345
[sighs in exasperation]

38:41.193 --> 38:43.112
[upbeat music playing]
