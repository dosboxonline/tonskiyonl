To our makers
Who are no longer with us

02:01.872 --> 02:04.583
You have seen a film based on real events
that happened in France in winter 1996

02:55.300 --> 02:56.009
Existence is a fleeting illusion

02:56.593 --> 02:58.554
What does dance mean to you?

02:59.262 --> 02:59.888
Everything.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.559
Dance is everything.

03:04.935 --> 03:05.936
It's all I have.

03:07.989 --> 03:10.907
If you couldn't dance,
what would you do?

03:12.909 --> 03:13.810
Suicide.

03:13.819 --> 03:17.781
When you're on stage dancing...

03:18.574 --> 03:20.534
you feel free, no barriers,

03:20.659 --> 03:21.618
no judgement.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.037
Just us, our body and sensations.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.584
I find marijuana is a great muscle relaxant.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.462
So when you dance
the sensations are a bit different,

03:32.588 --> 03:34.339
you're more sensitive...

03:36.592 --> 03:39.845
with certain muscles, or sensations.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.806
When I dance, I can be someone

03:42.931 --> 03:45.475
I can't be anywhere else.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.728
OK.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.438
Is your family supportive?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.314
Yes.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.525
Mum, dad, everyone...

03:53.650 --> 03:55.193
They know what you dance?

03:55.318 --> 03:55.819
Yes.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.403
Do they come to watch?

03:57.529 --> 03:58.572
No.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.656
I prefer not.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.908
What would they say?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.702
They'd be a bit shocked.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.789
Would you do anything to make it?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.333
Meaning?

04:15.463 --> 04:17.841
You're in a profession where...

04:17.966 --> 04:19.968
you need to bring enjoyment...

04:22.345 --> 04:23.805
I'm ready for anything.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.098
What's anything?

04:25.641 --> 04:26.725
Everything.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.394
I don't know what you'll ask me to do

04:29.520 --> 04:30.771
but I'm primed

04:30.896 --> 04:33.774
and honestly, it's a chance in a million

04:33.899 --> 04:36.652
to work with a choreographer like you.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.615
It could really help me evolve,

04:41.740 --> 04:42.824
so I'm ready for anything.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.785
I can ask you anything?

04:44.910 --> 04:45.827
Anything.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.371
My worst nightmare?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.958
To find myself alone.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.210
With nothing and no one around.

04:54.335 --> 04:54.961
Alone.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.006
Do you have a life motto?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.718
"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

05:02.511 --> 05:03.929
Do you believe in paradise?

05:04.054 --> 05:04.888
Yes.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.098
Why?

05:08.099 --> 05:09.726
Because I want to.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.812
What's in paradise?

05:12.688 --> 05:13.980
Everything good.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.941
Meaning?

05:17.568 --> 05:19.528
Only good things, no problems.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.362
There's no chaos there.

05:22.519 --> 05:24.395
I am from Berlin,

05:24.563 --> 05:27.523
but I'm happy to leave.

05:27.690 --> 05:32.194
It became too much.
The art scene there is too much

05:32.361 --> 05:36.323
I really want to do what I love,

05:36.490 --> 05:39.742
without... being fucked up.

05:41.619 --> 05:44.705
There's a lot of drugs in Berlin.
It's too much.

05:45.122 --> 05:49.000
My ex-roommate,
I don't talk to him anymore...

05:49.166 --> 05:53.379
Before I moved out,
he started to take acid in his eyes.

05:53.545 --> 05:55.088
Like actual drops.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.511
So I decided to get away
from all that, because...

06:01.969 --> 06:05.014
I don't want to
end up like Christiane F.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.200
I like to let off steam...

06:10.746 --> 06:13.624
I have my secret garden that I...

06:16.877 --> 06:18.754
I like to go to when I party.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.090
I tried a line of coke once.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.052
You asked me to be open so...

06:27.679 --> 06:29.515
Yeah, I snorted a line with a girlfriend.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.182
My worst nightmare?

06:35.687 --> 06:36.688
My worst nightmare?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.439
I'm real scared of darkness.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.483
Really scared.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.654
You know, when you do your own thing,

06:43.779 --> 06:45.196
it's make or break.

06:46.823 --> 06:51.578
And in my experience, it's mostly break.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.540
I wade right in.

06:55.081 --> 06:59.210
If there's a problem,
I deal with it then move on.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.548
What's the worst
you've done to a guy in a fight?

07:03.048 --> 07:05.216
I smashed a head once.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.220
Knocked two of his teeth out.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.848
He had a big gash in his forehead.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.642
He passed out.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.185
Two days in a coma.

07:15.686 --> 07:16.645
Do you regret it?

07:17.563 --> 07:19.064
Not really. That's life.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.106
Do you do drugs?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.942
No, never.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.946
No drugs. I'm more into girls.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.699
What do you think of the other dancers?

07:28.824 --> 07:29.825
Some look good.

07:30.826 --> 07:31.952
It all seems good.

07:33.119 --> 07:33.995
Meaning?

07:34.830 --> 07:36.915
Some of the girls are hot.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.792
Your cousin's your partner in crime?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.711
Yeah, we pick up girls together.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.128
And guys?

07:42.879 --> 07:43.964
Guys, well...

07:47.593 --> 07:49.720
Guys... it depends.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.850
Straight up, I've never worked with gays before.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.143
I'm a little nervous, but...

07:57.268 --> 07:58.937
it's no big deal...

07:59.605 --> 08:01.898
I'm just waiting for the first connection.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.736
I've heard things but want to see for myself.

08:05.861 --> 08:10.240
For sure, I'm a bit nervous about it.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.784
But I like that, feeling the fear.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.121
Being brother and sister, we're close of course,

08:16.246 --> 08:19.708
but with dance we share an activity that...

08:22.293 --> 08:23.879
keeps us close.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.964
We'll be touring France and the States.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.173
What do you think?

08:27.883 --> 08:30.010
I've been to New York so...

08:30.135 --> 08:32.846
Wow, that's awesome!

08:33.554 --> 08:35.181
We've never been to the US together.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.892
Yes, I've been to New York.

08:37.017 --> 08:37.768
Oh?

08:37.893 --> 08:38.894
With who?

08:39.019 --> 08:42.147
The US is the place to go.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.609
And for black culture too, it's great.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.152
America?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.780
America...

08:49.905 --> 08:51.740
it's heaven on earth.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.159
You've been there?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.243
Never.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.328
I come from hell.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.998
Where is hell?

09:02.042 --> 09:05.962
We're lucky in France to really shine in dance.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.463
It's incredible.

09:07.589 --> 09:11.176
It would be interesting
to take that to other countries,

09:11.301 --> 09:14.054
like America or places where...

09:14.179 --> 09:16.097
the level's not so high.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.059
France is a country that really has our back,

09:19.184 --> 09:21.812
helping us, with its culture,

09:21.937 --> 09:23.772
and music,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.817
which really lets us...

09:26.942 --> 09:28.819
flourish and...

09:28.944 --> 09:30.862
work with a level of excellence.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.989
It's the French trademark.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.873
PRESENT A FRENCH FILM AND PROUD OF IT

15:18.209 --> 15:19.503
God is with us!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.967
Now let's party!

15:32.473 --> 15:34.475
I love your kid!

15:34.601 --> 15:35.310
My Tito.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.227
Great dancer!

15:36.352 --> 15:37.270
Can I dance with him?

15:37.395 --> 15:39.981
Go ahead. I made some sangria.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.399
Later.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.236
What did you think?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.237
Awesome!

15:46.362 --> 15:48.489
Maybe just
the two girls in the middle...

15:48.615 --> 15:49.825
Totally get it.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.326
We'll rehearse it later.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.244
Everyone's tired,
they wanna have fun.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.996
Sure, it's tough.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.833
For just 3 days' work, it was fabulous.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.834
What are you discussing?

15:58.959 --> 15:59.543
You! Come talk with me.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.385
Yo, David!

16:09.776 --> 16:11.944
You do this every time!

16:26.444 --> 16:27.362
Sangria?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.238
I don't drink.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.280
Oh sure.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.406
You know it.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.242
Cool.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.412
Drink?

16:36.538 --> 16:37.122
No, thanks.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.164
Sure?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.332
I don't feel good.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.048
Here.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.050
Thanks.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.143
What do you want?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.395
I told you to stop.

17:00.521 --> 17:01.938
I told you yesterday, please.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.439
No one's looking, OK?

17:05.150 --> 17:06.276
Happy now?

17:07.318 --> 17:08.403
I wanna be with you.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.154
When?

17:09.279 --> 17:10.405
I'm here now.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.698
Go dance!

17:19.335 --> 17:21.336
You! You!

17:21.962 --> 17:25.047
That solo, every single time, it's so good!

17:25.214 --> 17:26.214
Thank you.

17:26.590 --> 17:28.425
- You're so good.
- You liked it?

17:28.592 --> 17:33.054
I couldn't be happier.
Thank you guys, you're amazing.

17:33.221 --> 17:34.217
You...

17:34.220 --> 17:34.680
Sorry!

17:35.138 --> 17:35.556
Don't worry.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.140
I love your attitude.

17:37.265 --> 17:37.724
Thanks.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.143
You and Omar have something going...

17:40.268 --> 17:41.144
Say what?

17:43.313 --> 17:44.272
Great rehearsal, huh?

17:44.397 --> 17:44.981
Yeah.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.108
I got my eye on you, watch out.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.744
Hey Daddy, great track!

17:58.704 --> 17:59.412
Up for a drink?

17:59.538 --> 18:00.539
No.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.373
She'd like one.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.208
Thanks.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.087
Why so glum?

18:07.212 --> 18:08.296
I'm not, I'm just tired.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.506
Stop sulking!

18:09.631 --> 18:11.299
I'm tired!

18:11.424 --> 18:13.134
You're always tired!

18:15.303 --> 18:16.137
Help me down?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.180
No sweat.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.689
It's sangria I made for the dancers.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.941
It's alcohol, it's not good for you.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.275
It's not juice.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.026
Alcohol.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.695
Give the kid a break!

18:31.820 --> 18:33.739
Come dance with me, Tito!

18:38.785 --> 18:39.703
Dance with me!

19:02.183 --> 19:04.269
Pump it up, Daddy!

19:04.394 --> 19:05.395
How was it?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.648
Great!

19:07.773 --> 19:09.274
As usual.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.244
What's up?

19:23.413 --> 19:24.623
Remember our dance?

19:29.903 --> 19:33.114
This way, then like this...

19:35.074 --> 19:36.283
Then like that.

19:36.677 --> 19:37.844
Can I have a hug?

19:40.221 --> 19:41.222
And another?

19:42.766 --> 19:43.642
One more?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.856
How hard can you laugh?

19:51.421 --> 19:53.090
Where's your mom?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.275
I'm gonna get changed.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.165
What was the deal earlier?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.125
What?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.209
With your bro.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.669
You know your pal Taylor...

20:52.794 --> 20:54.462
He's afraid I'll get pregnant.

20:54.588 --> 20:55.296
Chill.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.161
Down the hatch.

21:26.286 --> 21:26.912
No.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.333
It stinks, why drink it?

21:37.255 --> 21:37.964
David!

21:41.593 --> 21:42.678
Selva...

21:52.270 --> 21:53.980
I'm worried about the boy.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.232
Why?

21:56.357 --> 21:57.776
He's gone to bed, he's fine.

21:57.901 --> 21:58.777
Something wrong?

22:00.445 --> 22:01.655
Nothing at all.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.505
This is not a good place for a kid.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.883
Leave it out.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.635
He's fine.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.597
He's happy, good mannered.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.014
No.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.517
Yes, she's raised him well.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.352
She was right to not abort him.

22:35.606 --> 22:37.524
Wicked sangria!

22:37.649 --> 22:38.859
Wicked!

22:41.570 --> 22:43.404
Have you ever had an abortion?

22:48.994 --> 22:50.621
It's good to have the choice.

22:52.748 --> 22:53.957
Don't you think?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.587
BIRTH IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

22:58.712 --> 23:00.380
You know mummy was a dancer.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.841
When I see you,

23:02.966 --> 23:05.093
I see myself as a little girl.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.388
I hope you'll be a dancer, like mummy.

23:08.972 --> 23:09.598
Yes.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.391
Have you spent 3 nice days here?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.894
We don't see each other much, do we?

23:14.019 --> 23:15.604
Today I made an effort.

23:15.729 --> 23:16.813
I'm a good mummy?

23:16.938 --> 23:17.564
Yes.

23:17.689 --> 23:18.732
Give me a kiss.

23:22.152 --> 23:24.404
Close your eyes, go to sleep.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.033
Sleep now.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.285
I'll be back later, because I love you.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.996
I love you, Tito.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.415
That flag over there...

23:35.874 --> 23:37.208
It freaks me out.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.251
I don't like it.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.711
I like all flags.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.880
The colours and all, it's cool.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.008
But this one... I've seen it too much.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.095
Change of scenery, please!

23:49.220 --> 23:51.056
Those crosses are creepy, man.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.891
Chill, it's not contagious.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.102
Don't be a prick.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.355
God is great.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.066
"God is with us."

24:01.191 --> 24:03.234
Since when have God
and dance gone together?

24:03.359 --> 24:04.444
That's not it.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.487
I'm not OK with it.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.323
And you?

24:09.866 --> 24:10.826
Still the same.

24:11.785 --> 24:12.410
Your dad?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.705
Still in a coma.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.039
So we wait.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.248
How long now?

24:20.210 --> 24:21.461
Almost 6 months.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.088
Long time.

24:23.213 --> 24:23.922
Yep.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.341
If you're down it's complicated,

24:26.466 --> 24:27.968
if you ask me...

24:29.720 --> 24:32.222
to take drugs... just...

24:32.806 --> 24:34.808
in a safe place.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.853
And with my boyfriend I thought...

24:38.812 --> 24:39.688
it was safe.

24:39.813 --> 24:40.396
Sorry?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.190
I thought it was safe

24:42.858 --> 24:43.609
to take it,

24:43.734 --> 24:45.318
but you never know
where it comes from.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.112
See that babe...

24:47.237 --> 24:48.530
I fucked her yesterday.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.157
Yesterday, bro.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.367
Oh yeah...!

24:54.119 --> 24:55.245
And she's crap.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.332
So I wanna fuck two blondes.

25:00.141 --> 25:02.685
Stop acting like I don't exist.

25:13.569 --> 25:15.529
You're so fuckin' fake.

25:16.822 --> 25:18.365
I'm not fake, you're boring.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.186
Dyke stuff never works.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.188
They need cock.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.148
For sure.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.028
Both of them together, fuck it!

25:34.535 --> 25:36.327
You asked about me marrying.
Do you want kids?

25:36.452 --> 25:38.747
No, fuck that, I never think about it.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.124
People ask these dumb questions.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.209
"Watch out, he's like this or that,"

25:43.334 --> 25:45.003
I don't give a shit.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.421
There's a connection,

25:46.547 --> 25:48.423
I take it, I live it, period!

25:48.549 --> 25:49.299
I move on.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.725
What a coke fiend!

25:58.850 --> 26:01.144
Always snorting.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.439
It stinks. Stinks.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.483
You said you want to get married?

26:07.609 --> 26:08.109
Yes.

26:08.234 --> 26:08.985
I heard right?

26:09.110 --> 26:09.945
Yes.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.071
How many times?

26:11.196 --> 26:12.363
Once!

26:13.156 --> 26:14.032
Just once.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.867
I'd like to marry 4 times.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.328
Best to do it often.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.873
Change the game, the person, everything...

26:22.373 --> 26:24.417
How does she do it, at her age?

26:25.836 --> 26:27.170
Honestly...

26:27.295 --> 26:29.590
he must totally manipulate her.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.383
He's hungry.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.844
He's tried to screw us all.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.137
A climber. Why's he with the boss lady?

26:36.262 --> 26:37.180
To go places.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.516
He's with everyone.

26:40.225 --> 26:43.269
With her he's just looking for work.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.189
We hit lucky here...

26:47.608 --> 26:49.109
Bro! Omar!

26:49.234 --> 26:50.318
Wake up!

26:50.443 --> 26:51.862
Get out of your trip!

26:51.987 --> 26:54.114
You don't drink, you do nothing.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.074
I've boned them all here.

26:56.199 --> 26:56.617
All of them.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.245
David? He's a ticket to an STD.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.080
That's mean.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.373
He's my buddy!

27:04.666 --> 27:06.084
He's nice, but...

27:07.878 --> 27:08.504
He should...

27:09.045 --> 27:10.547
I bet he has herpes.

27:10.672 --> 27:11.673
He's dirty.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.134
Just the way he looks at you...

27:14.885 --> 27:15.844
Cut it out!

27:15.969 --> 27:17.303
It can be a turn-on.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.890
Ok, he's a sonofabitch!

27:21.182 --> 27:22.392
He has his charms.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.477
Is he a good lay at least?

27:24.603 --> 27:25.521
A top shooter!

27:25.646 --> 27:27.564
Sometimes they make out like...

27:27.689 --> 27:28.899
No, really!

27:29.024 --> 27:30.108
Have you two screwed?

27:30.233 --> 27:33.361
No, but he's banged
someone next to me.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.445
A young chick...

27:34.571 --> 27:35.864
You gang bang?

27:35.989 --> 27:37.490
He fucked her brains out.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.993
Tell me about Gazelle.

27:40.619 --> 27:41.537
Just a little.

27:41.662 --> 27:42.579
I'm curious.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.414
Please?

27:44.540 --> 27:47.543
Just a little, no details if she's ass or pussy.

27:48.001 --> 27:51.421
Just... how nuts she goes.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.464
You live your life, I live mine.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.259
Your life is mine as well.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.302
Get off my case.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.556
I don't get it, I'm reacting...

28:01.014 --> 28:02.599
No, I don't see why you react like that.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.226
What makes Omar special?

28:05.351 --> 28:06.186
Everything.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.395
Oh yeah?

28:07.521 --> 28:08.479
He's got everything!

28:09.147 --> 28:10.148
Know what?

28:10.273 --> 28:11.274
I wanna bone her.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.110
I'm not surprised.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.613
Honestly, I wanna bone her.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.323
You're a lucky man.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.991
You're not as tough as me.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.871
So, let's ask her.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.582
Maybe we can do a threesome?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.668
You say: "It's the last night,

28:32.337 --> 28:33.505
"everything sucks,

28:33.630 --> 28:35.507
"the sex...

28:35.632 --> 28:37.300
"it's not like before...

28:37.425 --> 28:40.887
"Nowadays, group sex is the thing, all that stuff."

28:41.012 --> 28:42.263
And we do it.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.181
What bugs you?

28:43.306 --> 28:44.182
Seeing you together.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.183
I don't like him.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.185
We may seem buddies but we're not.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.269
So what?

28:49.563 --> 28:50.981
I'm your big brother.

28:51.106 --> 28:53.525
I'm 20, not a baby anymore.

28:54.067 --> 28:54.651
So?

28:55.777 --> 28:57.320
You disrespect me.

28:57.988 --> 29:00.490
He seems totally uptight.

29:01.617 --> 29:02.909
Only with you!

29:03.034 --> 29:04.077
Say what?

29:04.536 --> 29:05.704
What it says.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.623
You're not my mum or dad.

29:07.748 --> 29:08.582
Just my big brother.

29:08.707 --> 29:09.165
So?

29:09.290 --> 29:10.876
You're 25. I'm 20, an adult.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.460
But you're...

29:13.336 --> 29:14.630
still too young for that.

29:15.088 --> 29:15.881
For what?

29:16.006 --> 29:17.549
What you do with Omar.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.134
You know what we do?

29:19.259 --> 29:21.344
I see enough.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.054
No need for details.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.056
You've had your dick sucked already.

29:25.181 --> 29:25.891
So?

29:26.016 --> 29:28.769
That doesn't mean you can suck his...

29:29.269 --> 29:30.353
any time you like!

29:31.396 --> 29:32.523
That's not how it goes.

29:32.648 --> 29:36.109
It's normal when
you've been together 9 months, no?

29:36.234 --> 29:37.694
9 months, you two?

29:37.819 --> 29:38.904
He didn't tell you?

29:39.029 --> 29:39.655
No.

29:40.280 --> 29:41.489
Think it's funny?

29:42.032 --> 29:43.784
This place has seen some weird shit.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.662
I can feel it,

29:47.120 --> 29:50.415
sacrifices... strange shit, for sure.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.376
You mean like a sect?

29:53.502 --> 29:54.628
All that stuff.

29:54.753 --> 29:57.422
How can you walk in a room
and see a flag like that?

29:57.548 --> 29:58.339
No way.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.425
No way!

30:00.551 --> 30:02.678
I don't dig the vibe in this group.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.680
They're weird.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.723
And this school...

30:07.390 --> 30:08.600
intensifies it.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.562
It magnifies the sense of weirdness.

30:12.604 --> 30:13.730
Weird or not...

30:13.855 --> 30:15.106
I'll fuck them all!

30:17.776 --> 30:18.569
Straight up!

30:20.153 --> 30:21.572
Weird or not, I fuck them.

30:21.697 --> 30:22.488
True...

30:23.574 --> 30:25.116
Even if the ghost turns up.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.326
On the flag!

30:26.451 --> 30:28.244
We'll fuck him on the flag!

30:29.204 --> 30:30.831
Ghost or no, he'll get some!

30:31.331 --> 30:33.291
I'm sick of all the
fathers and brothers

30:33.416 --> 30:35.752
on our case all the time,
telling us what to do.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.379
Who you can or can't see. Enough already.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.632
There's more to life than men.

30:40.757 --> 30:41.675
Too right.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.719
There are girls...

30:44.177 --> 30:45.596
nice ones too, huh?

30:46.555 --> 30:47.514
Like who?

30:48.181 --> 30:50.350
Some cute ones in the group.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.644
Don't you think?

30:52.769 --> 30:53.604
Like me?

30:54.187 --> 30:56.356
You know already, I told you.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.483
So why bring it up?

30:58.609 --> 31:01.737
I'm not, it just came up...

31:03.279 --> 31:05.532
You're up for some filthy shit, man.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.451
Hell, yeah.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.747
I'm gonna beat those two up tonight.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.041
They deserve it.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.459
Too true.

31:16.585 --> 31:18.211
I'm getting a real good vibe now...

31:18.670 --> 31:19.921
Real good!

31:20.506 --> 31:22.674
I'm ready for some crazy shit!

31:23.634 --> 31:25.594
You're too unstable, that's your trouble.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.639
Learn to keep it in your pants.

31:28.764 --> 31:30.431
You only live once, bro.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.809
When it's long like mine...

31:32.934 --> 31:34.185
you gotta use it.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.395
It's a gift!

31:37.438 --> 31:38.607
I gotta share it.

31:46.532 --> 31:49.242
I bet they do it with strap-ons.

31:51.537 --> 31:52.788
I don't dig that shit.

31:53.705 --> 31:56.249
I'd fuck Psyche good.

31:56.374 --> 31:57.626
So good.

31:57.751 --> 32:00.253
When she does her wacko
workout thing, I love it!

32:00.378 --> 32:01.421
On the floor.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.256
On the floor! Straight in!

32:03.381 --> 32:04.257
Bare knees!

32:04.382 --> 32:05.383
Bare knees!

32:05.509 --> 32:06.552
No lube.

32:07.468 --> 32:09.304
Wet or not, I keep at it!

32:09.429 --> 32:10.764
I keep at it anyway!

32:10.889 --> 32:13.141
You keep at it. You slap her!

32:13.266 --> 32:14.392
No other way.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.052
<i>It's party time!</i>

32:17.478 --> 32:19.147
A babe like that?

32:19.272 --> 32:22.526
When I stick my cock in,
it goes all the way up to her throat.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.403
I don't stop till she weeps.

32:25.529 --> 32:26.404
Till she weeps!

32:26.530 --> 32:27.488
Gotta make her weep!

32:28.281 --> 32:29.199
I love her.

32:31.535 --> 32:34.705
Despite her flaws, her mistakes...

32:35.288 --> 32:36.247
I love her.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.502
So you'll get back with her?

32:41.712 --> 32:43.880
I'd like to.

32:44.464 --> 32:47.217
Too bad she's pregnant.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.677
It's someone else's.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.472
Her "sweet butterfly," she says.

32:52.973 --> 32:54.182
She's pregnant?

32:54.307 --> 32:54.975
Yes.

32:55.559 --> 32:56.518
By another guy?

32:56.643 --> 32:57.393
Yes.

33:00.313 --> 33:01.523
Imagine...

33:02.816 --> 33:04.693
your dream man...

33:05.986 --> 33:07.863
in love with someone else.

33:07.988 --> 33:09.280
Lou, she's hot.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.866
Think she takes it up the ass?

33:10.991 --> 33:12.909
Hell yeah, all the way!

33:13.744 --> 33:14.953
Deep inside.

33:16.329 --> 33:17.873
Dry or with lube?

33:17.998 --> 33:19.666
Dry, man!

33:23.920 --> 33:25.296
You grab her,

33:26.507 --> 33:27.674
spread her arms...

33:31.762 --> 33:32.513
Badass!

33:33.597 --> 33:34.556
That's how it goes!

33:34.681 --> 33:35.348
Dry.

33:35.473 --> 33:36.141
Dry!

33:36.266 --> 33:36.933
No jelly.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.770
I hate that stuff.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.647
I prefer shea butter.

33:41.772 --> 33:43.189
It's the real deal.

33:43.314 --> 33:44.608
Slides right in.

33:45.651 --> 33:47.903
You have to pull her hair, for sure.

33:48.028 --> 33:48.654
The basics.

33:48.779 --> 33:49.738
I bang her.

33:49.863 --> 33:50.697
I fuck her.

33:51.532 --> 33:52.741
I'm telling you...

33:53.283 --> 33:54.034
that girl...

33:55.368 --> 33:56.745
She's a big deal.

33:56.870 --> 33:57.871
Give it to her good!

33:57.996 --> 33:58.997
Nice sweet ass.

33:59.748 --> 34:01.041
Fuck her real good.

34:03.293 --> 34:05.546
Then again... no sweat.

34:05.671 --> 34:06.713
Sure.

34:06.838 --> 34:07.881
Selva's my pick.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.927
When she walks that way I wanna bang her.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.887
When she talks or looks at you...

34:14.012 --> 34:14.846
Showing off.

34:15.514 --> 34:16.264
It's too much.

34:16.389 --> 34:17.389
I get it.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.309
You gotta show her who's...

34:19.434 --> 34:20.976
Gonna show her what I got...

34:21.101 --> 34:22.353
An anaconda!

34:22.478 --> 34:23.522
That chick...

34:23.647 --> 34:26.065
One day, after rehearsal...

34:26.983 --> 34:28.985
you follow her upstairs...

34:29.110 --> 34:30.402
you follow her.

34:30.529 --> 34:31.737
You show her.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.322
Just show her!

34:34.407 --> 34:36.367
Show it to her!

34:37.409 --> 34:38.579
My willy?

34:38.704 --> 34:39.830
You know what.

34:39.955 --> 34:41.246
She'll freak out.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.248
That's life, man!

34:42.373 --> 34:44.543
I stick it straight in her ass.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.627
No waiting.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.503
Straight in.

34:46.628 --> 34:47.670
In the ass.

34:48.714 --> 34:50.674
I'm not annoyed, but you don't listen.

34:52.092 --> 34:53.342
It gets a little...

34:53.802 --> 34:55.721
I'm sick and tired of it.

34:56.513 --> 34:57.305
What?

34:57.430 --> 34:58.599
Waiting!

34:58.724 --> 35:00.391
After a while, you know...

35:01.434 --> 35:02.603
It's best to wait.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.021
You're young. You're rich.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.983
You'll get plenty of cock.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.317
Sicko!

35:09.442 --> 35:12.028
No need to do it all right now.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.531
Take your time, be different.

35:14.656 --> 35:16.575
I bet David will take two days.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.745
David will never go with you.

35:19.870 --> 35:20.871
You'll see...

35:21.955 --> 35:23.582
Selva won't let him.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.000
Screw Selva.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.043
I don't know if you get it, but...

35:27.168 --> 35:28.712
who gives a fuck about Selva?

35:29.588 --> 35:31.006
Who is she, anyway?

35:31.131 --> 35:34.926
Get me David and wham bam it's done.

35:35.051 --> 35:36.678
Do as you like.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.429
You always do.

35:38.555 --> 35:40.056
That's what I said I'd do!

35:40.181 --> 35:42.183
Yep! That's why you're still a virgin.

35:43.727 --> 35:45.020
Not for long!

35:45.145 --> 35:46.730
With David, for sure!

35:47.814 --> 35:48.899
He's clearly a virgin.

35:50.150 --> 35:51.026
It's gotta happen.

35:51.151 --> 35:52.944
He gotta get his butthole split.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.696
Nice and wide.

35:55.405 --> 35:56.698
With a baton.

35:59.868 --> 36:00.744
A big one.

36:01.912 --> 36:04.414
You know the score: first they squeal,

36:04.540 --> 36:06.332
then they're happy and want more.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.793
I won't touch no butthole, man.

36:07.918 --> 36:09.545
Butthole's not my thing.

36:09.670 --> 36:10.629
Smells of shit.

36:10.754 --> 36:12.756
Oh, come on!

36:14.800 --> 36:15.801
No butts.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.010
Know what you do?

36:17.135 --> 36:18.178
You lick it.

36:18.679 --> 36:19.345
What?

36:19.470 --> 36:20.471
The butthole!

36:23.975 --> 36:24.810
Crazy!

36:24.935 --> 36:25.727
Lick it good.

36:25.852 --> 36:27.604
Stick your tongue in.

36:27.729 --> 36:28.814
Even when it stinks?

36:28.939 --> 36:30.691
Don't worry, man.

36:31.525 --> 36:32.901
It's nature!

36:33.026 --> 36:33.735
You kidding?

36:33.860 --> 36:35.403
Occupational hazard, bro.

36:35.529 --> 36:37.698
You've had a babe poop on you?

36:37.823 --> 36:39.449
No, but hey...

36:39.575 --> 36:40.909
Shit happens!

36:41.535 --> 36:43.078
Occupational hazard!

36:44.037 --> 36:46.456
It's a risk, you go down there,

36:46.582 --> 36:48.667
you know what you'll find.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.044
If you find it, don't act surprised.

36:51.169 --> 36:52.713
No way, man...

36:52.838 --> 36:55.924
It's double or quits.
In, out, in, out...

36:59.595 --> 37:01.930
I've put Tito to bed, I'm worn out.

37:02.055 --> 37:03.682
Gimme a smoke.

37:03.807 --> 37:04.933
He's a cute kid.

37:05.976 --> 37:08.895
You start dancing young,
you're hot to trot.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.146
And then...

37:12.148 --> 37:14.693
You get screwed in some corner,

37:14.818 --> 37:16.528
then you get pregnant.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.488
So what do you do?

37:18.614 --> 37:20.699
You have to make your big mistakes

37:20.824 --> 37:22.242
a success.

37:23.118 --> 37:25.579
I don't even know
what time the van's coming tomorrow.

37:26.496 --> 37:27.956
And everyone's dancing happily.

37:28.081 --> 37:30.876
The only thing I've ever done right
is this sangria.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.003
It's real good.

37:37.007 --> 37:37.841
That's it.

45:59.801 --> 46:02.012
This is for France, guys!

46:02.638 --> 46:04.556
Let's slaughter those yanks!

46:04.681 --> 46:07.100
Slaughter them!

46:08.059 --> 46:10.270
This is War!

46:15.679 --> 46:17.055
Brought you:

46:37.573 --> 46:38.949
Dancing to music by:

46:57.380 --> 46:58.757
Filmed by:

47:28.657 --> 47:30.450
It's hot in here!

47:31.284 --> 47:33.120
Booty parade!

47:34.912 --> 47:37.456
- Lou, do you want my glass?
- No thanks.

47:38.374 --> 47:40.792
You know what?
The sangria is halal.

47:41.335 --> 47:42.503
Oh shit.

47:52.302 --> 47:53.803
I feel weird.

47:54.304 --> 47:55.889
Go drink some water.

48:11.892 --> 48:12.893
Selva.

48:13.894 --> 48:15.311
Gimme some coke.

48:15.436 --> 48:16.062
Huh?

48:16.187 --> 48:17.147
Some coke.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.525
None left.

48:19.650 --> 48:21.192
Ask the druggy.

48:29.785 --> 48:32.120
Gimme some coke, babe.

48:32.245 --> 48:33.371
I'm all out.

48:33.496 --> 48:34.372
I heard you had some.

48:34.497 --> 48:35.498
It's all gone.

48:37.584 --> 48:38.835
All cool?

48:38.960 --> 48:40.754
I'm cool. Gimme a light.

48:42.673 --> 48:44.132
Daddy, look!

48:44.257 --> 48:45.759
Look...!

48:45.884 --> 48:46.718
Over there.

49:02.317 --> 49:03.401
What are you doing?

49:03.527 --> 49:04.319
Gazelle!

49:04.444 --> 49:05.571
I'm burning!

49:06.530 --> 49:07.698
Something's kicking in.

49:11.702 --> 49:12.536
Gazelle!

49:13.203 --> 49:13.995
I'm off.

49:48.321 --> 49:49.364
Bravo!

49:51.533 --> 49:52.659
Way to party!

50:04.546 --> 50:05.672
What's going on?

50:06.715 --> 50:08.049
We're partying, chill.

50:08.717 --> 50:11.261
Go dance and have fun, you earned it.

50:11.386 --> 50:12.012
Dance, baby!

50:42.292 --> 50:43.043
What have you done?

50:44.419 --> 50:45.420
What do you mean?

50:46.713 --> 50:48.006
I haven't done anything.

51:00.811 --> 51:01.436
Selva!

51:02.062 --> 51:03.354
I've done nothing.

51:05.524 --> 51:06.441
What's wrong?

51:06.567 --> 51:07.483
I don't know.

51:08.902 --> 51:09.778
She's feeling sick?

51:09.903 --> 51:10.779
I don't know.

51:12.906 --> 51:13.657
Selva?

51:15.491 --> 51:16.326
You OK?

51:18.411 --> 51:20.581
You're all too drunk,
I'm going to bed.

51:51.862 --> 51:53.697
What's up? Feel sick?

52:01.663 --> 52:02.455
Selva?

52:09.755 --> 52:10.964
Don't you guys feel weird?

52:11.548 --> 52:12.633
What've you done?

52:13.091 --> 52:15.511
What did you put in the sangria?
I don't feel good.

52:15.636 --> 52:16.553
What are you talking about?

52:17.804 --> 52:19.347
What? I haven't done anything.

52:19.472 --> 52:20.431
What've you done?

52:20.557 --> 52:21.975
What's wrong with you all?

52:22.100 --> 52:22.893
Daddy!

52:23.685 --> 52:25.729
That bitch spiked our drinks!

52:28.439 --> 52:31.401
The sangria's spiked, it's not me,
I drank it too.

52:31.527 --> 52:33.361
So that's why I feel bad.

52:33.486 --> 52:34.445
It's not me.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.031
What did you put in it?

52:36.156 --> 52:37.908
Here's the bitter slut.

52:38.033 --> 52:39.743
I drank it too!

52:41.411 --> 52:42.495
Stop!

52:43.539 --> 52:44.831
Hear her out!

52:44.956 --> 52:46.875
It must be someone who didn't drink it.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.836
I know who it is.
It's Omar, the sonofabitch!

52:51.630 --> 52:52.005
It's not him!

52:52.130 --> 52:53.507
Why haven't you drunk it?

52:53.632 --> 52:54.508
You spiked it with LSD?

52:54.633 --> 52:55.676
It's not him!

52:55.801 --> 52:57.010
Why did you do it?

52:59.220 --> 53:00.639
He drugged us!

53:00.764 --> 53:01.515
It's him!

53:03.517 --> 53:04.434
Stop, stop!

53:04.560 --> 53:05.476
Get out!!

53:05.602 --> 53:06.477
Stop!

53:18.699 --> 53:19.741
Asshole!

53:21.577 --> 53:22.619
Open up!

53:23.787 --> 53:24.788
Let me go!

53:35.674 --> 53:36.758
Is LSD acid?

53:36.883 --> 53:37.593
I don't know!

53:37.718 --> 53:38.802
What's the remedy?

53:38.927 --> 53:39.595
Coke.

53:40.053 --> 53:40.762
Coke.

53:43.849 --> 53:45.809
Hand it over, we need it.

53:45.934 --> 53:47.477
I'm out, fuck off!

53:48.895 --> 53:49.855
It's not you?

53:49.980 --> 53:50.647
No.

53:50.772 --> 53:51.397
Are you sure?

53:51.523 --> 53:53.859
We're all fucking high.

53:53.984 --> 53:55.986
We're all fucking high,
can't you see?

53:59.698 --> 54:00.574
You OK?

54:00.699 --> 54:01.742
No, can't you see?

54:01.867 --> 54:02.868
Did you see your son?

54:02.993 --> 54:03.827
Fuck!

54:07.831 --> 54:08.665
Don't drink that!

54:09.833 --> 54:10.959
You mustn't.

54:11.084 --> 54:11.752
Come on!

54:11.877 --> 54:12.961
No, mummy!

54:13.086 --> 54:14.004
They're all crazy in here!

54:15.589 --> 54:17.382
Mummy, no!

54:17.508 --> 54:18.509
Calm down!

54:20.552 --> 54:21.595
Stop tugging!

54:25.223 --> 54:26.933
Come on, stop that!

54:30.854 --> 54:32.105
Mummy...

54:33.524 --> 54:34.525
No...

54:36.192 --> 54:38.737
No, mummy, you're mean!

54:38.862 --> 54:40.071
I love you!

54:40.196 --> 54:41.823
I'm doing it to protect you.

54:43.033 --> 54:44.034
You're mean!

54:48.038 --> 54:49.956
Listen, listen to me.

54:50.081 --> 54:51.249
Don't touch that!

54:51.708 --> 54:53.001
Don't touch it!

54:53.126 --> 54:55.128
It'll kill you if you touch it.

54:55.253 --> 54:56.254
No, mummy!

54:58.632 --> 55:00.050
Don't leave me alone!

55:01.176 --> 55:03.303
Open the door!

55:04.638 --> 55:05.722
I can't!

55:05.847 --> 55:07.766
I'll be back, I'll sort it out.

55:07.891 --> 55:09.643
I'll be back, don't worry.

55:10.226 --> 55:11.687
I'll be back.

55:11.812 --> 55:13.939
I love you. Calm down, please.

55:14.064 --> 55:15.065
What are you doing?

55:17.734 --> 55:19.027
Protecting him from you!

55:19.152 --> 55:19.945
From who?

55:20.070 --> 55:21.071
All of you!

55:45.679 --> 55:46.805
Go fuck yourself!

55:46.930 --> 55:48.098
Dumb bitch!

55:48.223 --> 55:49.850
Useless cunt!

56:03.238 --> 56:04.072
Selva?

56:05.073 --> 56:05.907
Selva!

56:09.139 --> 56:10.724
I'm talking to you.

56:13.810 --> 56:15.353
Do you hear me?

56:16.438 --> 56:17.939
I need you.

56:35.245 --> 56:36.705
I'm sorry.

56:43.236 --> 56:43.945
What's wrong?

56:46.907 --> 56:48.199
I don't feel good.

56:48.324 --> 56:50.035
You drank too?

56:50.160 --> 56:50.952
No, I didn't.

56:54.998 --> 56:56.792
So why do you feel sick?

57:04.800 --> 57:05.425
Are you ok?

57:07.260 --> 57:10.096
The sangria's been spiked by Emmanuelle.

57:10.221 --> 57:11.139
I don't know...

57:11.264 --> 57:12.891
What's wrong with you all?

57:14.225 --> 57:15.852
What's wrong with you all?

57:17.813 --> 57:19.022
Why do you feel sick?

57:23.443 --> 57:25.278
Can you keep a secret?

57:25.403 --> 57:26.780
Yes.

57:27.405 --> 57:28.281
Always.

57:29.457 --> 57:30.708
Selva.

57:32.035 --> 57:33.787
Can you keep one for me?

57:35.330 --> 57:36.790
Please?

57:40.460 --> 57:41.377
Of course.

57:42.003 --> 57:42.879
I have...

57:46.717 --> 57:50.220
I have something growing in my tummy.

57:56.059 --> 57:56.893
Like what?

57:58.269 --> 57:59.896
I'm pregnant, Selva!

58:03.483 --> 58:04.234
Shit.

58:07.070 --> 58:07.779
Yep.

58:09.489 --> 58:10.281
Shit.

58:12.743 --> 58:13.744
What'll you do?

58:14.410 --> 58:15.203
I don't know.

58:18.164 --> 58:19.249
Who's the dad?

58:21.042 --> 58:22.085
No idea.

58:24.212 --> 58:25.213
I don't know.

58:27.257 --> 58:28.509
I'm wasted...

58:29.217 --> 58:30.552
You gals too?

58:31.052 --> 58:32.303
I'm fine.

58:32.428 --> 58:33.514
You're alright?

58:36.517 --> 58:38.143
Could you leave us?

58:38.268 --> 58:39.728
Why?

58:39.853 --> 58:41.271
She's weird.

58:43.273 --> 58:44.482
You didn't drink...

58:45.942 --> 58:47.152
No, she didn't...

58:48.278 --> 58:49.362
She feels sick.

58:50.572 --> 58:52.240
Me too.

58:52.365 --> 58:53.742
Could you please just...

58:53.867 --> 58:55.243
Strange, why didn't you drink?

58:55.368 --> 58:57.120
I feel sick, it happens!

58:59.455 --> 59:00.957
You drugged us, huh?

59:01.082 --> 59:01.917
No!

59:02.417 --> 59:03.209
She didn't.

59:05.086 --> 59:06.462
Dom, please!

59:06.588 --> 59:07.839
You drugged us.

59:07.964 --> 59:08.799
Not true!

59:08.924 --> 59:09.883
You're talking shit!

59:11.301 --> 59:12.427
Are you nuts?

59:12.553 --> 59:13.344
You drugged us.

59:14.387 --> 59:15.847
Go dance with the crew.

59:15.972 --> 59:17.599
I threw Omar out for nothing...

59:19.893 --> 59:20.852
Because of you.

59:22.103 --> 59:22.896
Why didn't you drink?

59:23.021 --> 59:23.772
She's pregnant!

59:23.897 --> 59:25.398
Wait a sec, please!

59:25.524 --> 59:26.441
You're pregnant?

59:26.567 --> 59:28.276
Pregnant, you lying bitch?

59:33.574 --> 59:35.283
Lying cunt!

59:36.577 --> 59:37.536
Bitch!

59:39.830 --> 59:40.413
Whore.

59:51.216 --> 59:52.926
Call an ambulance!

59:56.054 --> 59:57.639
Will somebody help me?

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.191
Lou?

01:00:10.902 --> 01:00:12.237
What's wrong, Lou?

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:14.948
What happened?

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:38.764
Oh God...

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:40.348
You're such a bitch!

01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:42.392
You had some all along.

01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:44.645
So gimme some.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:45.646
Get off me.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:05.957
Lou!

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.334
Wait!

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:09.503
Go away!

01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:11.254
Go away!

01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:16.176
Dom!

01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:17.468
I'll kill you!

01:01:18.386 --> 01:01:19.638
I'll kill you!

01:01:24.225 --> 01:01:25.101
Mummy!

01:01:25.226 --> 01:01:26.436
There are cockroaches!

01:01:35.612 --> 01:01:36.738
It's a nightmare!

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.532
A nightmare.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.913
What's going on?

01:01:45.038 --> 01:01:46.289
What's going on in here?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.043
Dom!

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:51.628
Someone...

01:02:02.313 --> 01:02:04.440
Do you want to see my anaconda?

01:02:07.818 --> 01:02:10.028
Where is Dom?
Where is Dom?

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:17.738
Hey Taylor!

01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:19.322
Check out your sister.

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.617
Check her out!

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:30.250
What are you doing?

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:39.342
Why did you do that?

01:02:42.095 --> 01:02:43.054
She hit me!

01:02:43.179 --> 01:02:44.139
Look!

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:46.307
We kicked the wrong guy out.

01:02:46.432 --> 01:02:47.643
It wasn't Omar, it's her!

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:49.310
She poisoned us.

01:02:50.562 --> 01:02:51.437
You drugged us?

01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:52.438
Yes she did.

01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:53.690
What do you mean?

01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:54.983
Know what?

01:02:55.108 --> 01:02:56.527
She claims she's pregnant.

01:02:56.652 --> 01:02:57.736
Who's the dad?

01:02:58.444 --> 01:02:59.404
Who is it?

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.906
Who wants you?

01:03:01.031 --> 01:03:01.532
You're a liar!

01:03:01.657 --> 01:03:03.074
Who fucked you?

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:06.327
You're pregnant so you didn't drink?!

01:03:06.452 --> 01:03:07.328
You did it!

01:03:07.453 --> 01:03:08.454
No!

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.373
Shut the fuck up!

01:03:11.082 --> 01:03:12.626
What the fuck are you saying?

01:03:13.209 --> 01:03:14.545
What are you talking about?

01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:16.505
It's the son of David!

01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:18.173
Get off me!

01:03:22.553 --> 01:03:23.637
Go for her!

01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:26.640
You're threatening me?

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.725
What are you gonna do?

01:03:30.101 --> 01:03:31.477
Want to hit me again?

01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:32.646
She hit me!

01:03:37.818 --> 01:03:39.360
Shut up!

01:03:39.485 --> 01:03:39.861
Fuck off!

01:03:41.362 --> 01:03:42.072
Do it!

01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:43.699
I'll make you abort!

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:44.783
Gazelle!

01:03:46.367 --> 01:03:48.119
Go on, do it!

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.308
Do it!

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:13.228
Go on, kill yourself!

01:04:13.895 --> 01:04:15.271
Go on!

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:17.482
Do it!

01:04:17.733 --> 01:04:18.650
Do it!

01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.333
Stop!

01:04:36.668 --> 01:04:38.294
Stop, please.

01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.214
Gazelle!

01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:46.344
Lou!

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:48.346
Stop it!

01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:49.765
Stop it!

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:50.807
Get off me!

01:04:50.932 --> 01:04:52.518
It's not your fault.

01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:55.353
Leave her!

01:04:55.478 --> 01:04:56.813
Leave her, Eva!

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:09.576
You don't get it, I don't want to!

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:20.504
Let's get outta here.

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:27.803
Come on Selva, we're leaving.

01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:37.521
Mummy!

01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:40.231
Mummy!

01:05:47.363 --> 01:05:48.198
Come on.

01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:49.449
We're leaving.

01:05:51.492 --> 01:05:52.493
It's out of control.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.977
Stop crying, please.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.149
We'll leave together.

01:09:51.774 --> 01:09:53.068
I'll find the key.

01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:55.153
I'll find it, don't worry.

01:09:55.654 --> 01:09:56.738
Open the door.

01:09:57.614 --> 01:09:59.533
I lost the key.

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:02.118
Go find it.

01:10:02.243 --> 01:10:03.286
I lost it.

01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:04.788
Go find it!

01:10:04.913 --> 01:10:06.206
I'm scared!

01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:09.793
Open the door, I'm scared.

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:14.881
Open the door.

01:10:15.006 --> 01:10:15.799
Please!

01:10:15.924 --> 01:10:16.883
Everything's fine.

01:10:20.261 --> 01:10:22.472
Something's moving here!

01:10:25.058 --> 01:10:26.476
It's a party...

01:10:28.895 --> 01:10:31.481
There's balloons and surprises...

01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:02.888
Mummy!

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:07.601
Mummy!

01:12:20.924 --> 01:12:22.634
The keys must be here...

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:37.774
Come here!

01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:38.692
Motherfucker!

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:39.693
Shithead!

01:12:40.902 --> 01:12:41.987
Bring him here.

01:12:44.114 --> 01:12:45.031
Fuck him up!

01:12:45.156 --> 01:12:45.991
Harder!

01:12:46.116 --> 01:12:46.783
Harder!

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.171
Slimy shit!

01:13:01.339 --> 01:13:02.591
Gimme a knife!

01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:03.717
I'll circumcise him!

01:13:05.426 --> 01:13:06.678
Get off him.

01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:25.656
You're sick.

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:29.826
Take that.

01:13:31.327 --> 01:13:32.412
Don't wanna play with me?

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:46.301
What are you doing?

01:13:46.426 --> 01:13:47.886
Gimme that!

01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:48.679
What?

01:13:48.804 --> 01:13:49.721
The lipstick!

01:13:49.846 --> 01:13:50.681
That hurts!

01:13:50.806 --> 01:13:51.431
Let go!

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:52.307
That hurts!

01:13:53.183 --> 01:13:54.475
Let go, dammit.

01:13:58.479 --> 01:13:59.856
Come here, fucker!

01:13:59.981 --> 01:14:00.899
Thought you were badass?

01:14:01.024 --> 01:14:02.067
Huh, asshole?

01:14:09.282 --> 01:14:10.450
Piece of white shit!

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:11.451
Motherfucker!

01:14:13.411 --> 01:14:14.287
Get off!

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:32.222
Help me, please...

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:35.016
Please...

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.231
Please!

01:14:42.733 --> 01:14:43.775
Please...

01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:23.533
Selva, come with me.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.487
Shit! Tito's fried!

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.119
Oh God, I've killed him!

01:16:18.244 --> 01:16:19.079
I've killed him!

01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:20.163
Fried!

01:16:21.122 --> 01:16:22.207
Tito!

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.250
Stop screaming!

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:25.836
Music!

01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:28.463
Music!

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:30.591
It's OK.
I got my ghetto blaster!

01:16:34.344 --> 01:16:35.846
I'll put it on, don't worry.

01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:00.370
Open the door, Tito!

01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:02.372
Open up!

01:18:07.688 --> 01:18:08.689
What are you doing?

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.023
The blood!

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:12.108
The blood... the blood...

01:19:59.883 --> 01:20:00.967
Selva.

01:20:02.728 --> 01:20:04.729
Get out! Get out!

01:20:19.784 --> 01:20:22.286
What do you want?
Why...

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:23.824
What do you want?

01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.202
Get out.

01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:30.121
I don't want to see you any more.

01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:32.332
I don't want to see you!

01:20:48.682 --> 01:20:50.266
Leave the girls be.

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:23.884
Baby, don't cry!

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:26.887
My little baby.

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:32.893
Everything will be fine.

01:21:34.645 --> 01:21:35.771
We're home.

01:21:35.896 --> 01:21:36.897
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:41.527
What's happening?

01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:42.653
We're home.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.571
Riley?

01:21:46.948 --> 01:21:48.408
Leave me alone!

01:21:48.534 --> 01:21:49.785
Get out!

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:51.286
Just get out!

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:54.831
Get out!

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:13.892
What's going on?

01:22:14.392 --> 01:22:15.268
Get off!

01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:18.647
Get the fuck out of here!

01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:19.606
Gazelle!

01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:24.485
Gazelle!

01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:26.487
Wait!

01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:34.454
Wait!

01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.543
It's too dangerous!

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.131
Wait up.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:46.967
It's far too dangerous!

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:48.134
I'm gonna kill myself!

01:22:49.135 --> 01:22:50.428
I just want to protect you.

01:22:51.179 --> 01:22:52.514
I'm coming, Tito!

01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:58.228
Gazelle!

01:23:04.234 --> 01:23:05.235
Gazelle!

01:23:06.528 --> 01:23:07.654
Hold me close.

01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:09.405
You know we can't do it.

01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.406
Let go.

01:23:51.782 --> 01:23:52.574
I'm sorry, Gazelle.

01:23:52.699 --> 01:23:53.449
Let me go.

01:23:53.825 --> 01:23:54.785
Let's go somewhere.

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:56.494
Look what you did to Omar.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.829
Look what you did!

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:00.541
Say you love me.

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:01.875
Let me go!

01:24:02.918 --> 01:24:03.752
Mummy!

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:05.170
What are you doing?

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:06.296
I love you Gazelle.

01:24:06.421 --> 01:24:08.256
I'll tell mum and dad. Let me go!

01:24:08.882 --> 01:24:10.717
I just want to go, please.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:12.343
I love you.

01:24:12.468 --> 01:24:13.469
No!

01:24:14.387 --> 01:24:14.888
Gazelle!

01:24:16.264 --> 01:24:17.473
Let go!

01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:21.562
Help!

01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:22.688
I'm here, don't scream.

01:24:22.813 --> 01:24:23.814
Help!

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:25.023
Let go.

01:24:25.524 --> 01:24:26.567
You're a liar.

01:24:26.692 --> 01:24:28.484
I'm not, Gazelle. I love you.

01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:29.736
You're vile!

01:24:29.861 --> 01:24:30.946
We'll go where you want.

01:24:31.237 --> 01:24:32.072
Let me be.

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:33.114
Wanna go to New York?

01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:34.240
Let go.

01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:36.660
Only I can make you happy.

01:24:36.785 --> 01:24:38.537
Everyone's watching.

01:24:38.662 --> 01:24:39.746
Not here!

01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:42.248
Not here!

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:48.314
What's wrong?

01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:56.281
Hold me.

01:25:57.323 --> 01:25:58.449
You're my world.

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:02.788
Let's go to the room.

01:26:07.543 --> 01:26:08.627
To the room.

01:26:09.795 --> 01:26:10.671
The room.

01:26:14.883 --> 01:26:16.009
You're everything to me.

01:26:16.718 --> 01:26:17.511
Everything.

01:27:37.966 --> 01:27:39.009
Please...

01:27:39.134 --> 01:27:40.426
Please!

01:30:06.907 --> 01:30:07.699
Do it!

01:30:10.201 --> 01:30:10.994
Do it!

01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:13.079
Do it!

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:20.211
Life is a collective impossibility

01:32:39.142 --> 01:32:39.976
Look here.

01:32:47.483 --> 01:32:48.359
Lady?

01:32:50.571 --> 01:32:51.404
Lady?

01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:00.288
She's gone.

01:33:37.158 --> 01:33:43.957
Death is an extraordinary experience

01:34:14.029 --> 01:34:15.071
Nothing happened...

01:34:16.447 --> 01:34:17.282
What?

01:34:17.407 --> 01:34:18.324
Nothing happened.

01:34:19.492 --> 01:34:20.451
What do you mean?

01:34:23.955 --> 01:34:24.873
Don't tell dad.

01:34:26.124 --> 01:34:27.083
Don't tell dad.
