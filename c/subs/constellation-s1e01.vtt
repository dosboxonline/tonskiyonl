<i>...conditions worse-- Why don't you answer?</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:35.702
<i>There are flames... Fire! Fire!</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:37.579
<i>Capsule is on fire.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:39.790
<i>Twenty-one...</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:43.168
<i>Twenty-one...</i>

00:43.168 --> 00:47.965
<i>Thirty... forty... forty-two...
There are flames...</i>

01:08.277 --> 01:10.237
Could we please have it a bit warmer?

01:10.863 --> 01:14.575
It's broken, honey. Snuggle down.

01:24.334 --> 01:28.505
Mummy? What's she saying?

01:30.048 --> 01:33.510
She's saying...
that the world is the wrong way around.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.309
When's Daddy coming?

02:21.642 --> 02:22.643
Mummy?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.315
What's happened to Daddy?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.226
Close the door, honey.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.367
It's freezing.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.037
Come, I'm gonna get the fire started.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.880
Can I have a story?

03:35.007 --> 03:36.008
Yeah.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.551
Yeah.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.221
I can read for you.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.431
The iPad one.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.850
The space one.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.393
I prefer it.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.353
Yeah.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.541
<i>Hi, I'm Johanna. I'm an astronaut.</i>

04:10.709 --> 04:12.961
<i>And I work for the European Space Agency.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:16.048
<i>I live on the International Space Station.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:18.926
<i>I'm going to be up here for a whole year.</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:21.553
<i>And I got a very special bedtime story.</i>

04:22.137 --> 04:24.389
<i>It's called "The Little Rocket Girl."</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:27.809
- <i>Do you want me to read it?</i>
- Yes.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.229
<i>So, it goes like this.</i>

04:30.229 --> 04:33.065
<i>"Up and out in space, it's very cold.</i>

04:33.065 --> 04:37.569
<i>The stars move fast and the sun burns hot
just to try to stay warm.</i>

04:38.362 --> 04:40.781
<i>Up and out in space, it's very quiet.</i>

04:41.782 --> 04:45.202
<i>But the worst thing
about up and out in space</i>

04:45.202 --> 04:49.414
<i>is that it can be very, very lonely."</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:14.064
Mamma!

05:39.089 --> 05:40.424
Mamma!

05:56.899 --> 05:58.025
Mamma!

06:06.867 --> 06:09.369
Alice? Leaving in 15.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.247
I'll be right down.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.381
<i>Stand by.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:23.550
- I'm all ready to go.
- Okay.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.052
Say hi.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.763
<i>Mission control connecting you now.</i>

06:45.656 --> 06:46.615
<i>Mamma?</i>

06:46.615 --> 06:48.367
Good morning, honey...

06:49.409 --> 06:50.827
Have you brushed your teeth?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.621
<i>Yes.</i>

06:52.621 --> 06:54.456
How many minutes?

06:54.456 --> 06:55.624
<i>Three minutes.</i>

06:55.624 --> 06:58.669
'Cause that's what we do in our family.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.214
<i>Are you going on your space walk today?</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:07.886
You don't need to worry, honey.
We're ready for it.

07:07.886 --> 07:08.804
<i>I know.</i>

07:08.804 --> 07:10.722
Would you like to say good morning to Yaz?

07:11.723 --> 07:14.142
- Hi, Alice. Good morning.
- Hey, Yaz.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.854
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

07:16.854 --> 07:18.313
Just a little bit.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.191
Do you wanna take a look at the lettuce?
I think they're looking fairly perky.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.819
Some of them have woken up a bit.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.153
What do you think?

07:25.737 --> 07:28.156
- <i>Isn't it magical?</i>
- Looks good.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.658
<i>But I might let one</i>

07:29.658 --> 07:31.243
- <i>of the others try it first.</i>
- Yes.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.579
Just a bit worried
that it might turn me into an alien.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.456
- <i>Check the connection.</i>
- Copy that.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.792
We have to whisper.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.627
<i>Why is that?</i>

07:43.088 --> 07:46.008
'Cause they're doing
something very fiddly at the CAL.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.676
Hey, Alice.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.969
<i>Hi, Paul.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:50.304
Your mom's big day today.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.141
RPL. CAL data:

07:54.141 --> 07:59.563
Core signals green, magnets aligned, 25.5.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.232
- Copy, phase six.
- <i>Copy.</i>

08:03.233 --> 08:06.528
<i>Core temperature: minus 203 degrees.</i>

08:06.528 --> 08:08.155
Tune lasers.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.281
Come on.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.200
<i>What does it do?</i>

08:11.200 --> 08:13.619
It's looking for a new state of matter.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.829
<i>What does that mean?</i>

08:15.829 --> 08:16.955
Don't know.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.626
<i>Eighty-four days till you're home.</i>

08:20.626 --> 08:21.752
Only 84.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.086
<i>I can't wait.</i>

08:23.086 --> 08:24.254
Aw.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.423
I miss you so much.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.175
I miss you too, Mamma.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.844
<i>Will you be careful when you go out there?</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:32.846
Always.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.640
I'll see if I can see you.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.394
- <i>Wow.</i>
- Look.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.020
There you are.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.648
You see?

08:44.358 --> 08:46.026
- <i>We're ready.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

08:46.902 --> 08:48.111
Good luck, son.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.490
Good luck, Commander.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.952
I've always been lucky till now.

08:58.622 --> 08:59.706
Hey, Alice.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.542
Wave to yourself.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.502
Begin.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.431
Station, RPL, do you copy?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.725
Get them back.
We're in the middle of something.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.228
Mamma?

09:21.228 --> 09:22.312
Are you there?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.565
Everything all right?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.108
She's gone.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.705
Debris! Scallation!

09:51.842 --> 09:52.843
<i>Mamma?</i>

09:53.343 --> 09:55.012
Alice! Alice!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.436
<i>Houston, this is Station.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:03.729
Do you copy?

10:06.356 --> 10:09.067
Houston, this is Station. Do you copy?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.448
- GC, lock the doors.
- Repository is not activated.

10:14.448 --> 10:18.660
Station, Houston on space to Ground 1,
you have a depressurization.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.912
All comms are open.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.581
Crew gather in Soyuz 1 evacuation capsule.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.833
Initiate pre-evacuation protocols.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.668
Execute emergency response.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.671
Houston, fire and fog in Zarya.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.965
- <i>Power down.</i>
- Ilya!

10:32.466 --> 10:33.717
<i>Jo, go immediately</i>

10:33.717 --> 10:36.220
<i>to nearest evacuation capsule, Soyuz 1.</i>

10:36.220 --> 10:39.890
Houston, there's a fire
between us and Soyuz 1.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.934
<i>Gather in Rassvet instead.</i>

10:42.434 --> 10:45.229
Jo, I can't get through!

10:47.231 --> 10:49.983
Ilya, we need to get
to the evacuation capsule!

10:51.610 --> 10:52.736
Copy.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.863
What the fuck hit us?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.199
Something hit us!

10:57.741 --> 10:59.284
Get through now!

11:01.078 --> 11:02.454
I'm out.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.747
Brace me!

11:10.921 --> 11:12.297
I'll get the hatch.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.466
<i>Station, you need to suffocate the fire.</i>

11:14.466 --> 11:16.009
Copy! On it!

11:16.677 --> 11:18.679
Shutting off pressurization in Zvezda.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.223
Something hit us.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.227
- You guys okay?
- Hatch secured.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.979
<i>Crew, roll call.</i>

11:26.979 --> 11:28.397
Ericsson.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.690
Andreev.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.233
- Brostin.
- Suri.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.152
- <i>Lancaster?</i>
- <i>I'm stuck.</i>

11:37.990 --> 11:38.824
Air is clear.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.286
Ericsson, Brostin,
air is clear. Assist Commander Lancaster.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.203
Copy.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.706
<i>Andreev, Suri,
check systems and life support.</i>

11:46.206 --> 11:48.375
- <i>We're on it.</i>
- <i>Checking.</i>

11:49.209 --> 11:51.170
Houston, we're losing oxygen.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.422
- I can hear it.
- <i>Station, copy.</i>

11:54.423 --> 11:56.258
Paul? How are you doing?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.887
- I'm stuck.
- He's pinned in.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.848
- He's covering the depress.
- We need to tourniquet him here.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.933
- Apply pressure on the artery.
- Here, got it.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.730
- Houston, Paul's injured.
- <i>Copy.</i>

12:09.730 --> 12:13.775
His left arm is crushed beneath rack four.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.444
He's bleeding heavily.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.613
What's the status of the systems?

12:17.613 --> 12:19.198
Ilya, what's the status?

12:20.073 --> 12:23.994
Power outages in 55% of Zvezda and Quest.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.748
<i>Depress in Harmony, Columbus.</i>

12:28.415 --> 12:29.541
Jo...

12:30.459 --> 12:31.752
you're in control now.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.504
We need to give him oxygen.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.088
- Copy.
- Go, go, go.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.342
<i>Crew, assess viability
of Soyuz evacuation capsule.</i>

12:38.842 --> 12:42.763
<i>You're signaling serious oxygen
and pressure loss across the ISS.</i>

12:42.763 --> 12:44.556
Copy. Ilya?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.352
- Paul, you're staying with me, huh?
- Yeah.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.563
<i>Audrey, you need to prep Paul
for immediate evacuation.</i>

12:51.563 --> 12:52.731
Just breathe.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.399
- Are you with me?
- He's unfit for evacuation.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.694
<i>Jo, electrical failure in Soyuz 1 capsule.</i>

12:58.195 --> 13:01.365
<i>Signals: 95% electrical failure.</i>

13:02.032 --> 13:03.283
Soyuz 2 functional.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.495
Soyuz 1 damaged.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.706
There's only three places in Soyuz 2.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.625
We can only evacuate three of us.

13:12.709 --> 13:17.923
Critical damage to all life support
and systems.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.926
<i>Stand by.
You're currently unable to launch Soyuz 1.</i>

13:20.926 --> 13:22.177
Pump.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.139
If we can't move him,
we're gonna have to amputate the arm.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.309
I'm so sorry, Paul.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.645
- Jo...
- You're gonna be okay.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.022
<i>Jo? Ilya?</i>

13:34.022 --> 13:36.441
<i>You were scheduled to do
a space walk this morning.</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:38.193
<i>You need to complete the space walk</i>

13:38.193 --> 13:41.280
<i>in order to fix life support
and damage to Soyuz 1.</i>

13:41.280 --> 13:42.865
I wanna come back.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.950
Okay. He's out. What about Paul?

13:44.950 --> 13:46.827
Jo, Audrey can take care of Paul.

13:46.827 --> 13:47.953
Got it.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.415
<i>You need to assess damage
to Soyuz 1 evacuation capsule.</i>

13:51.415 --> 13:53.250
<i>Fix life support and power.</i>

13:53.250 --> 13:55.252
- Copy.
- <i>Then we can bring you home.</i>

13:59.965 --> 14:01.258
Here we go.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.061
Okay, come on. This is terrible.
We can't both be late.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.396
If you're paying attention,

14:14.396 --> 14:16.607
we were six seconds
into deploying the laser

14:16.607 --> 14:17.983
at the time of the accident.

14:17.983 --> 14:22.279
The CAL would have retrieved information
within two millionths of a second.

14:22.279 --> 14:26.408
Keep it below minus 120 degrees
and get a retrieval plan.

14:26.408 --> 14:30.871
Commander, there's a signal from the CAL.
Something's coming through.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.873

- Come here. You see this?

14:48.138 --> 14:49.848
- <i>...on the ISS...</i>
- Holy shit.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.476
<i>...and we need to discuss a full evacuation.</i>

15:00.150 --> 15:01.527
Alice, hey, come on.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.278
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.405
Hey.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.702
Okay, everybody in your seats.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.958
Good morning.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.093
Are you okay, Wendy?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.304
I had nightmares.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.982
<i>Jo, Ilya,
your objective is to assess the damage</i>

15:39.982 --> 15:42.818
<i>to the electrical
and life support systems.</i>

15:42.818 --> 15:43.902
<i>Understood.</i>

15:43.902 --> 15:47.281
<i>Okay, Jo.
And you have a go for hatch opening.</i>

15:47.281 --> 15:48.615
<i>Copy.</i>

15:58.458 --> 16:00.085
Hatch is open and secure.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.714
- I'm heading outside.
- <i>I'm right behind you, Jo.</i>

16:07.009 --> 16:08.302
<i>Jo, Ilya,</i>

16:08.302 --> 16:12.264
<i>handing you over to Roscosmos Control
to handle the space walk.</i>

16:13.932 --> 16:14.933
<i>Good luck.</i>

16:16.435 --> 16:17.686
Copy.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.604
Understood.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.235
We'll direct. Let's get it fixed.

16:27.571 --> 16:30.908
<i>Okay, that's both of us clear
of the hatch.</i>

16:30.908 --> 16:33.744
You're gonna be in the dark
for approximately 20 more minutes.

16:33.744 --> 16:34.786
<i>Copy.</i>

16:34.786 --> 16:38.123
<i>Jo, Soyuz 1 capsule
is signaling total power loss.</i>

16:38.123 --> 16:40.709
You need to fix power cables on Unity.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.419
<i>Got it.</i>

16:43.545 --> 16:46.673
Ilya, you're heading down
to check escape capsule Soyuz 2.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.591
<i>Copy that.</i>

16:50.385 --> 16:55.432
Over Nauka, approximately eight meters.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.187
Some superficial damage.

17:01.063 --> 17:05.943
But Soyuz 2 looks
like it's more or less intact.

17:07.194 --> 17:11.156
Houston station,
operation completed on Paul.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.199
<i>Copy.</i>

17:12.199 --> 17:15.368
<i>ISS is down to 30% life support.</i>

17:15.368 --> 17:20.457
ESA, you cannot overstate
the importance of this experiment.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.834
We got a signal.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.962
A double-quantum signal.
That is highly significant.

17:24.962 --> 17:26.964
We appreciate the importance, RPL,

17:26.964 --> 17:30.634
but we can't prioritize NASA experiments
over arranging an evacuation.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.178
<i>Don't lecture me
about the evacuation, Frederic.</i>

17:33.178 --> 17:35.264
<i>I've been doing this for 50 years.</i>

17:35.264 --> 17:41.687
If we abandon ISS in the current
political climate, we're never going back.

17:41.687 --> 17:45.274
NASA, the science is not
more important than the people.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.734
We're not running
a goddamn kindergarten up there.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.698
We found another state of matter
that can only exist in zero gravity.

17:52.698 --> 17:57.035
Now, whatever is wrong up there,
it can be fixed.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.426
Oh, shit.

18:12.426 --> 18:16.388
We got severe collision damage
to the power supply.

18:19.933 --> 18:25.772
Oxygen system, external power cables
sheared through from this side.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.399
Cannot reconnect.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.820
Damage irreparable.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.324
Houston, please advise.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.826
Paul is going into cardiac arrest.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.286
Starting CPR.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.126
One and two and three and four
and five and six...

18:46.126 --> 18:48.795
Terminate EVA. Terminate EVA.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.423
Prepare Soyuz 2 for immediate reentry.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.926
EVA and Houston, disregard that command.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.511
- That command is not agreed.
- <i>RPL.</i>

18:55.511 --> 18:57.554
Houston, keep this loop clear.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.390
I will not allow us to make that decision

19:00.390 --> 19:03.936
until we have the schematics
to retrieve the CAL experiment.

19:03.936 --> 19:07.189
<i>Disagree. Let's end this call now
and get them down from there.</i>

19:08.649 --> 19:10.984
Sergei, continue with the space walk.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.448
Jo, medical team is working on Paul.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.991
<i>Continue with EVA.</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:19.076
Copy.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.452
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

19:20.953 --> 19:22.329
<i>Where am I heading now?</i>

19:22.329 --> 19:24.081
Tell her to head to the truss.

19:24.081 --> 19:26.917
It's critical they fix
secondary life support systems.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.170
What is the issue?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.589
Jo, we can't see what you see.

19:32.589 --> 19:33.799
- Check camera.
- <i>Understood.</i>

19:39.263 --> 19:40.347
I got a red light.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.517
<i>It's a fault. Sorry.</i>

19:43.517 --> 19:45.644
We've got no cameras operating past Unity.

19:45.644 --> 19:46.854
She needs to keep going.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.732
Okay. One minute till sunrise.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.193
Twenty-seven, 28, 29, 30.

19:56.446 --> 20:02.744
<i>Sunlight in five, four, three, two, one.</i>

20:10.043 --> 20:14.173
<i>Jo, you need to head to the truss
to fix secondary life support,</i>

20:14.173 --> 20:18.677
<i>otherwise, there won't be power
or oxygen for the crew repairs on Soyuz 1.</i>

20:18.677 --> 20:19.887
Copy.

20:19.887 --> 20:23.599
<i>Keep in mind we have no cameras
on the truss. They are all down.</i>

20:24.141 --> 20:25.809
<i>We are flying blind from here.</i>

20:25.809 --> 20:29.938
Okay. Heading over
to secondary life support systems.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.523
<i>Okay, Jo.</i>

20:33.025 --> 20:34.443
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.

20:34.443 --> 20:35.944
- Stop.
- Clear.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.240
- Start.
- One and two and--

20:52.336 --> 20:54.004
Rounding edge of PMM.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.007
The truss is coming into view.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.522
Oh, God.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.940
Get amiodarone.

21:12.940 --> 21:18.529
Twenty-one, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

21:41.844 --> 21:46.390
Whatever hit us completely destroyed
secondary life support systems.

21:48.809 --> 21:52.396
This is a substantial impact.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.774
One and two and three and four--

21:55.774 --> 21:59.653
- <i>Can you see what caused it?</i>
- Moving towards it.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.704
Working my way closer.

22:09.288 --> 22:13.208
Looks like it's a--
maybe-- 50 centimeter tear.

22:19.423 --> 22:24.178
There's something tangled
up in the-- in the truss.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.015
Ilya, can you copy?

22:28.724 --> 22:29.892
<i>Almost with you.</i>

22:30.893 --> 22:33.228
<i>Jo, please confirm visual.</i>

22:34.855 --> 22:37.482
It's orange fabric.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.529
I think I need to go from above.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.183
Come back. Shit. It's a body.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.519
<i>Jo, please confirm.</i>

23:15.103 --> 23:16.104
<i>Jo?</i>

23:17.731 --> 23:18.815
<i>Jo, respond.</i>

23:19.566 --> 23:21.735
<i>Ilya, we need visuals on Ericsson.</i>

23:23.028 --> 23:25.489
Jo! I'm coming!

23:34.665 --> 23:36.166
Check my O2 mix.

23:37.835 --> 23:38.836
Come on, Jo.

23:40.087 --> 23:41.088
Come on.

23:43.090 --> 23:45.884
Just a little. Yeah, Jo.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.182
I got you.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.519
Yeah.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.189
She's secured.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.693
Tell him to get a visual.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.529
Andreev, get a visual.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.330
Negative.

24:16.790 --> 24:21.545
It was a woman. USSR. Soviet.

24:22.546 --> 24:27.134
I saw a dead female cosmonaut.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.609
Come on!

24:43.609 --> 24:45.694
Come on, I'm not giving up!

24:45.694 --> 24:46.987
You come back!

24:51.950 --> 24:52.951
Come on.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.664
Come on.

24:59.958 --> 25:00.876
Come on.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.067
Houston, TsUP...

25:27.069 --> 25:28.111
Paul is dead.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.326
I repeat, Commander Lancaster is dead.

25:43.919 --> 25:47.339
<i>I'm-- I'm sorry to pass this on.</i>

25:47.339 --> 25:51.802
Station is reporting
that Commander Lancaster has died.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.264
He has died following cardiac arrest.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.318
Bye, Paul.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.547
Soyuz 2, prep for undock complete.

27:11.215 --> 27:14.551
<i>Deorbit Parameters are uplinked.
Families in transit to Baikonur.</i>

27:14.551 --> 27:16.803
Which is no fucking good
if we're all dead, is it?

27:16.803 --> 27:18.055
Take it easy.

27:19.848 --> 27:22.267
<i>We have a repair schedule for Soyuz 1.</i>

27:22.267 --> 27:24.811
<i>Three of you leave now in Soyuz 2,</i>

27:24.811 --> 27:28.023
<i>the remaining crew member
fixes power damage in Soyuz 1</i>

27:28.023 --> 27:31.401
using 606 batteries
from the Russian command module.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.321
Then Soyuz 1 is clear to return.

27:34.321 --> 27:38.242
Why don't two of us go now in Soyuz 2
and two of us stay to repair Soyuz 1?

27:40.118 --> 27:43.163
Insufficient life support
to sustain more than one person.

27:57.177 --> 28:02.099
So, Ilya, Yaz...

28:04.101 --> 28:07.563
Audrey, you came up in Soyuz 2.

28:08.063 --> 28:10.899
Jo, I'll stay.

28:10.899 --> 28:14.194
No, you're the Soyuz commander.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.531
You bring these two back home.

28:22.953 --> 28:24.288
That's an order.

28:27.499 --> 28:28.750
What about Alice?

28:33.422 --> 28:34.798
We've all got families.

28:50.814 --> 28:52.232
It's a bit sticky, isn't it?

29:06.205 --> 29:09.124
I'll tell you what, Luka, why don't
we just take the wings off and-and--

29:09.124 --> 29:11.418
Or maybe we just start again
with this guy, shall we?

29:19.468 --> 29:20.886
Is she gonna come back?

29:22.554 --> 29:23.597
I hope so.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.849
Why don't you say yes?

29:27.559 --> 29:29.269
Because I don't wanna lie to you.

29:30.771 --> 29:32.147
Listen, darling.

29:33.232 --> 29:38.028
Mummy has every chance
of coming back, but it's tricky.

29:48.789 --> 29:51.291
Nobody's ever not come back
from space before.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.545
Not from an ESA flight.

29:59.091 --> 30:00.676
I have to tell you something.

30:02.344 --> 30:03.804
It's quite upsetting.

30:08.767 --> 30:12.354
I'm afraid Wendy's dad has died.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.960
What are we gonna do with our bikes?

30:35.711 --> 30:36.837
We left our bikes.

30:44.636 --> 30:49.016
Duration of SKD burn,
two minutes 57 seconds.

30:49.016 --> 30:51.643
- Entry angle, 95 degrees.
- Ready to go?

30:51.643 --> 30:54.688
- Parameters are set.
- Ready to go.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.733
Anything you want us to say?

30:58.859 --> 31:00.068
Take a message home?

31:04.448 --> 31:09.536
If I don't make it back, will you please
be around for Magnus and Alice?

31:46.406 --> 31:47.616
<i>Tilting station.</i>

31:48.116 --> 31:49.660
<i>Thrusters tested.</i>

31:50.994 --> 31:53.288
Full power. Unbolt.

31:53.914 --> 31:54.748
Copy.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.256
<i>Bolt, armed.</i>

32:03.006 --> 32:06.760
<i>Fire thruster,
KDU engines in three, two, one.</i>

32:09.847 --> 32:11.598
<i>Mechanical disconnect.</i>

32:12.266 --> 32:13.684
<i>I see separation.</i>

32:17.062 --> 32:19.064
<i>Moving into approach trajectory.</i>

32:20.148 --> 32:23.569
Time to land: three hours 27 minutes.

32:24.069 --> 32:25.195
God willing.

32:44.965 --> 32:45.966
Bye.

32:55.934 --> 33:00.814
<i>Jo, you are to fill Soyuz 1
with enough provisions for 24 hours.</i>

33:04.401 --> 33:06.445
How much life support do I have?

33:08.113 --> 33:09.406
How much oxygen?

33:12.743 --> 33:15.412
<i>Approximately 19 hours.</i>

33:35.557 --> 33:36.558
All right.

33:44.233 --> 33:46.276
- Just listen to me.
- Go on through to the back, Alice.

33:46.276 --> 33:47.819
Resend the orbit information.

33:56.787 --> 34:00.707
Lancaster. We were just asking
as to the suitcases, the bags.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.001
So sorry from all of us.

34:03.001 --> 34:05.254
- I apologize again profoundly.
- Yes.

34:05.254 --> 34:06.672
Oh, Christ.

34:06.672 --> 34:08.005
I am so, so sorry.

34:08.005 --> 34:11.051
Wendy,
why don't you go and sit with Alice?

34:14.054 --> 34:15.429
I'm so sorry, Frida.

34:25.023 --> 34:26.149
Do you want my rabbit?

34:49.590 --> 34:51.300
Soyuz 1 is damaged.

34:51.300 --> 34:55.762
It has breathable atmosphere but doesn't
have enough power to get you home.

34:56.597 --> 35:00.851
<i>Once you've filled Soyuz 1 with supplies,
you need to remove the dead batteries</i>

35:00.851 --> 35:04.479
<i>and replace them
with the 606 batteries up in Zvezda.</i>

35:05.564 --> 35:10.819
<i>You'll have oxygen and power in the ISS
every 45 minutes to do repairs.</i>

35:11.945 --> 35:12.821
Copy.

35:12.821 --> 35:14.448
<i>Jo, your family are on their way.</i>

35:14.448 --> 35:16.491
<i>You can speak to them
when you get back to daylight.</i>

35:16.491 --> 35:17.743
Great.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.369
Close main hatch.

35:21.038 --> 35:22.998
- <i>Pressurize.</i>
- Copy.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.584
Wait.

35:27.169 --> 35:28.754
- I'll be right back.
- <i>Jo,</i>

35:28.754 --> 35:32.549
<i>the ISS only has solar power
for light and life support.</i>

35:32.549 --> 35:34.927
You have one and a half minutes.

35:34.927 --> 35:38.013
Night's coming.
You won't be able to pressurize.

35:38.013 --> 35:40.098
I just need to go and get something.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.059
I will make it in time.

35:42.059 --> 35:45.479
<i>Jo, when night comes,
you'll only have oxygen in Soyuz 1.</i>

35:45.479 --> 35:46.688
I know.

35:49.399 --> 35:52.152
- <i>Jo.</i>
- Tell Alice I'm taking her necklace.

35:54.863 --> 35:57.658
- <i>Jo, 20 seconds.</i>
- <i>I've got her necklace.</i>

35:58.325 --> 36:00.869
Mamma loves her. It means I'll be okay.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.330
I'm coming back to her and Daddy.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.249
Promise to pass that on.

36:05.249 --> 36:07.000
Ten, nine...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.002
- <i>Promise to tell her.</i>
- ...eight,

36:09.753 --> 36:12.297
<i>seven, six--</i>

36:16.426 --> 36:19.346
Sergei, do you promise?

36:21.390 --> 36:24.935
If you don't promise,
I'm just gonna sit here and sulk.

36:26.436 --> 36:28.438
- We'll pass it on.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

36:32.109 --> 36:34.736
<i>So, this is the procedure every orbit:</i>

36:35.237 --> 36:39.700
<i>45 minutes in the light,
45 minutes in the dark.</i>

36:40.325 --> 36:43.912
<i>Going out of comms.
Back in daylight in forty--</i>

37:29.499 --> 37:31.960
For the record,

37:32.461 --> 37:34.546
and I know

37:34.546 --> 37:39.593
how historically unlikely it is,

37:40.928 --> 37:44.014
this is my rendering

37:44.014 --> 37:49.228
of what hit the solar stack.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.481
Female corpse

37:53.023 --> 37:58.320
in USSR flight suit.

38:24.555 --> 38:26.390
<i>Should we go find Mummy, Alice?</i>

38:26.390 --> 38:27.474
<i>Okay.</i>

38:34.982 --> 38:36.567
Oh, my baby.

39:12.603 --> 39:14.646
<i>Good morning, Station. Morning, Jo.</i>

39:14.646 --> 39:16.398
Good morning, Sergei.

39:17.024 --> 39:20.194
- You're always so cheerful.
- <i>Thank you, Jo.</i>

39:20.694 --> 39:24.072
<i>We have approximately 17 hours,
49 minutes.</i>

39:24.823 --> 39:27.117
<i>Let's go find those batteries.</i>

39:27.117 --> 39:29.661
Let's do it. I wanna get home.

39:30.162 --> 39:33.123
The batteries weren't built to move,
but they should be accessible.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.416
Understood.

40:38.856 --> 40:41.191
It's gonna take longer than we thought.

40:42.526 --> 40:44.903
<i>SKD in minus 20.</i>

40:44.903 --> 40:48.615
Firing thruster in five, four,

40:49.199 --> 40:52.578
three, two, one.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.539
<i>Separation complete.</i>

40:59.001 --> 41:02.212
Irena, you're in charge
of this goddamn evacuation.

41:02.212 --> 41:03.422
I sent you a plan.

41:03.422 --> 41:06.216
I want Ericsson to bring back the CAL.

41:06.216 --> 41:08.760
Henry, I told them to leave your machine.

41:09.428 --> 41:11.388
Why on God's earth would you do that?

41:12.139 --> 41:14.725
For all I know, it caused the accident.

41:18.896 --> 41:22.983
Irena, there is something contained
in the six seconds that it was running

41:22.983 --> 41:26.320
that can make a difference to everything.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.822
To you, to me, my brother.

41:28.822 --> 41:31.283
It worked. We need it back.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.660
We will not get another chance.

41:34.286 --> 41:37.956
Send the retrieval plan, please.

41:45.672 --> 41:48.675
Soyuz 2, confirm deorbit parameters.

41:51.512 --> 41:54.598
Confirmed. Entry into atmosphere.

41:55.974 --> 41:58.018
Capsule has re-entered atmosphere.

42:06.735 --> 42:08.737
Send the CAL retrieval plan.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.973
Yeah? Getting off the plane as we speak.

42:36.473 --> 42:39.476
Heading straight to mission control.
What's her status?

42:40.269 --> 42:42.563
All right. Yeah. Bye.

42:43.981 --> 42:47.150
She's about to hit nightfall.
If we hurry, you can speak to her.

42:47.943 --> 42:49.403
- Good.
- Yeah?

42:53.740 --> 42:56.869
<i>Cinch all your straps down tight
while you are under G.</i>

42:56.869 --> 43:00.163
<i>Try to keep your airways open
by holding your head back.</i>

43:01.707 --> 43:02.791
Radio break off.

43:09.131 --> 43:10.674
<i>TsUP, do you copy?</i>

43:10.674 --> 43:12.593
We hear you, Ilya. Loud and clear.

43:13.594 --> 43:15.345
<i>Good to hear your voices.</i>

43:23.478 --> 43:27.191
Soyuz 2 deploys parachute,
entering controlled landing.

44:49.231 --> 44:51.024
<i>Jo. I have good news.</i>

44:51.692 --> 44:53.694
<i>That's a successful landing of Soyuz 2.</i>

44:53.694 --> 44:56.113
Copy. Great.

44:58.198 --> 45:00.117
<i>Jo, we are sending some schematics.</i>

45:00.117 --> 45:02.828
<i>RPL requests that you retrieve
one of their experiments.</i>

45:02.828 --> 45:06.164
- Which experiment?
- <i>CAL data core in Destiny.</i>

45:06.164 --> 45:08.667
Don't know it. Not sure I'll have time.

45:08.667 --> 45:12.129
It's a NASA experiment.
Don't jeopardize your safety.

45:13.046 --> 45:14.339
Is my family there?

45:14.339 --> 45:16.049
<i>They're on their way.</i>

45:16.049 --> 45:18.093
- <i>Ten minutes to nightfall.</i>
- Copy.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.954
I know you and Mummy were having problems.

45:48.123 --> 45:50.125
But I still want you to be friends...

45:52.127 --> 45:53.378
whatever happens.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.212
<i>Your family are in the building
and coming to speak to you.</i>

46:35.212 --> 46:37.130
I'd love to speak to them too.

46:38.048 --> 46:40.133
Wonderful. We are setting that up.

46:40.968 --> 46:42.219
<i>Copy.</i>

46:43.053 --> 46:45.389
Let's get this battery done
before nightfall.

46:45.889 --> 46:46.890
<i>Let's do it.</i>

46:49.017 --> 46:50.394
Your family are walking in now.

46:50.394 --> 46:51.478
<i>Copy--</i>

46:59.361 --> 47:02.155
Station, this is TsUP.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.493
TsUP, this is Station, come in.

47:12.958 --> 47:14.668
TsUP, this is Station, come in.

47:18.338 --> 47:20.257
What's happening? Daddy, what's happening?

47:38.650 --> 47:41.528
Hello, this is Station.
Is my family there?

47:44.323 --> 47:46.909
I'm gonna go ask them what happened.
You stay here for a second, okay?

47:46.909 --> 47:49.286
Excuse me? Hello? Excuse me?

47:50.329 --> 47:51.413
What's happening?

47:51.413 --> 47:52.915
Please respond.

48:14.144 --> 48:16.146
Alice. Come back. Alice!

48:33.664 --> 48:34.665
Alice.

48:38.001 --> 48:39.002
Alice!

48:44.800 --> 48:46.051
Alice!

49:35.392 --> 49:36.476
Go in.

50:14.473 --> 50:15.474
Shit.

52:21.308 --> 52:22.309
Hello?

52:53.757 --> 52:55.092
Wha--

52:55.092 --> 52:56.593
Mamma!

53:05.185 --> 53:06.270
Mamma!

53:08.522 --> 53:09.731
Mamma!

56:29.181 --> 56:30.766
Mamma.

56:39.650 --> 56:42.027
Where have you been?
