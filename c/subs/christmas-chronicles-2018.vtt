I know I haven't been doing too well

03:59.547 --> 04:00.713
He doesn't deserve anything.

Ow! Teddy, what the hell?

Oh, sorry! I meant "heck."

You used to laugh

No way. That person isn't wearing
an ugly Christmas sweater.

13:12.005 --> 13:12.880
And besides,

13:12.963 --> 13:15.630
Aunt Peggy's never here on Christmas Eve.
And if she was,

it's possible. But it is!

Ah...

34:01.838 --> 34:04.963
No, no, no, no. Teddy, Teddy,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

34:05.047 --> 34:06.255
Neither do I.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.422
Oh, come on!
Do you wanna save Christmas?

34:08.505 --> 34:10.005
Well, not by stealing a car.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.338
Uh, that kinda undermines

34:11.422 --> 34:13.422
the whole naughty or nice concept,
don't you think?

34:13.505 --> 34:15.588
Don't you break into, like,
a billion homes every year?

34:15.672 --> 34:19.297
-I mean, technically, that's illegal, too.
-Fair point.

34:19.380 --> 34:21.547
And, plus, it's not just any car.

34:21.838 --> 34:22.922
It's this car.

[alarm beeps]

34:24.838 --> 34:25.838
Oh...

34:26.755 --> 34:29.130
I mean, we're not even breaking the law
because...

34:29.213 --> 34:30.963
you know, the car's already stolen.

34:31.047 --> 34:33.880
-And when we're finished, we'll just--
-Turn it in to the police.

34:33.963 --> 34:35.630
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

34:36.422 --> 34:40.422
All right, now, slow down.
Just be cool. Walk regular. Regular.

34:40.505 --> 34:42.130
Hey, hey, slow down! Slow down!

34:42.213 --> 34:44.213

-Hey!
-Oh, no time to argue! Look!

34:47.547 --> 34:48.838
That's my car!

35:19.630 --> 35:21.338
No one's following us,
so you can slow down.

35:21.422 --> 35:23.088
Oh, come on, I'm not even going that fast!

35:23.172 --> 35:25.338
Here we go... [grunts]

you know that stuff's junk, right?

35:32.922 --> 35:35.797
Yeah, well, Katie Cat, one man's junk...

35:36.505 --> 35:37.880

Yeah, the car's stolen,
but we didn't steal it.

We were just borrowing it
before bringing it back to the station.

How about you, Dave?

Why don't you give us a "Ho ho ho"

-so we really know it's you?
-I don't do "Ho ho ho."

-Give 'em a call!

Okay, Santa Claus.
That's enough fun for one night.

44:08.255 --> 44:11.505
-Gotta take you to the station. Let's go.
-Wait! Look, it wasn't his fault.

44:12.213 --> 44:15.213

-What?
-So, he broke into your home?

44:31.047 --> 44:34.047
[chuckles] No, I-- He's Santa Claus.
That's...

44:34.422 --> 44:36.005
what he does. I--

44:36.880 --> 44:38.255
Look, guys, okay,

44:38.338 --> 44:40.172
I wouldn't have believed him either,
but...

44:40.255 --> 44:42.838

for Christmas is for her to come back.

-Yeah, I think maybe.

and talk about my ex-wife.

she's having second thoughts and...

what everybody wants for Christmas.

You stole a car.

You evaded a police officer,

do things in the North Pole, but...

I don't know, maybe ever.

I-- I just don't see how it's possible.

1:20:23.922 --> 1:20:26.797
You do the entire world in one night
all by yourself!

I mean, imagine what we could cover
if we all work together!

1:20:30.797 --> 1:20:31.713
[Kate] Yeah!

1:20:32.005 --> 1:20:34.422
Just think of us as Santa's helpers!

1:20:36.005 --> 1:20:37.047
Helpers?

1:20:38.130 --> 1:20:41.005
Well, I've never had human helpers
in the sleigh before...

1:20:42.963 --> 1:20:44.255
I dunno, maybe there's...

1:20:44.755 --> 1:20:46.755
some way we could work together to...

1:20:47.338 --> 1:20:49.172
make things move faster.

1:20:49.255 --> 1:20:51.838

of North America left.

If I didn't have to carry my sack,
I could move twice as fast!

1:20:59.380 --> 1:21:00.672
All right, this just might work!

1:21:00.755 --> 1:21:03.630
Now, Kate, you're in charge of getting
all the presents ready to go!

1:21:03.713 --> 1:21:05.755
You just call out the addresses
and the names,

1:21:05.838 --> 1:21:07.130
and you throw 'em outta the sack.

1:21:07.213 --> 1:21:10.172
Just chuck 'em out.
I'll catch 'em, and I'll deliver!

1:21:10.255 --> 1:21:12.338
And that means, Teddy, you drive!

1:21:12.797 --> 1:21:14.588
What? The sleigh?

1:21:14.672 --> 1:21:16.338
No! The cop cruiser!

1:21:16.422 --> 1:21:18.005
Of course the sleigh!

1:21:18.172 --> 1:21:21.713
[stammers] You--
You want me to drive... that?

1:21:21.963 --> 1:21:23.963

1:21:24.255 --> 1:21:27.172
[chuckles] Yeah, a car.
But, I mean, this is... This is...

1:21:27.255 --> 1:21:31.172
Now where is all that huff and puff
about "A Pierce always sees it through"?

1:21:31.255 --> 1:21:33.672
That was before you told me
I was gonna have to drive!

1:21:34.047 --> 1:21:35.963
Well, this is the only way
we're gonna make it,

1:21:36.047 --> 1:21:38.630
so I guess it's gonna be baptism by fire!

1:21:38.838 --> 1:21:41.297
Well, maybe I can help Kate
with presents, right?

1:21:41.755 --> 1:21:42.755

1:22:13.005 --> 1:22:15.380
Oh no, no, no, no! Santa, I can't do this!

1:22:15.463 --> 1:22:17.505

[Santa exclaims] Don't be afraid!
Don't be afraid.

1:22:29.797 --> 1:22:33.088
If there's one thing reindeer
can smell, it's fear!

1:22:33.172 --> 1:22:34.713
Santa, help him!

1:22:35.130 --> 1:22:39.380

Believe.

1:23:11.672 --> 1:23:15.088
-But I do believe in you!
-No, no, no! I'm not talking about me.

1:23:15.713 --> 1:23:17.463
You have to believe in yourself.

1:23:18.422 --> 1:23:20.672
The way your mother believes in you.

1:23:21.088 --> 1:23:22.630

1:32:42.713 --> 1:32:44.880
what if I forget everything
that happened tonight?

1:32:45.505 --> 1:32:48.338
Come on! I won't let you forget anything
about tonight...

1:32:48.422 --> 1:32:49.463
Katie Cat.

1:32:50.338 --> 1:32:52.213
Me neither, Teddy Bear.

1:32:52.297 --> 1:32:55.047
-[chuckles softly] Hug it out?
-Yeah.

1:33:03.797 --> 1:33:05.880
Were you two just... hugging?

1:33:06.588 --> 1:33:08.088
-[both] Yeah.
-[Mom chuckles]

1:33:08.880 --> 1:33:10.755
What are you guys doing out here?

1:33:12.838 --> 1:33:14.297
Waiting for you.

1:33:14.630 --> 1:33:15.880
[clicks tongue] Oh!

1:33:16.255 --> 1:33:17.838
[chuckles softly] What's that?

1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:21.255
It was a-- a gift from a friend.

1:33:21.713 --> 1:33:23.922
Hmm. Merry Christmas, guys!

1:33:24.005 --> 1:33:26.463
-[Kate and Teddy] Merry Christmas.
-[Mom sighs]

1:33:27.297 --> 1:33:29.338
We should go inside.
It's freezing out here.

1:33:29.588 --> 1:33:30.588
[Kate] Yeah.

1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:37.547
-[sighs] So, how was your night?
-[Teddy] You'll never believe it.

1:33:37.630 --> 1:33:39.172
-[Mom] Yeah?
-[Kate] Good.

1:33:40.672 --> 1:33:42.588
Well, what did you guys do all ni--

1:33:44.172 --> 1:33:45.838
Oh, my God!

1:33:48.422 --> 1:33:50.672
This is exactly the way Dad used to...

1:33:51.838 --> 1:33:53.630
I... [gasps]

1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.130
[chuckles softly]

1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:58.130
This is the best Christmas present ever.

1:33:59.213 --> 1:34:00.088
[sniffles]

1:34:03.547 --> 1:34:06.255
Look, there's presents.
Go open some presents. [sniffles]

1:34:06.672 --> 1:34:07.838
[cries softly]

1:34:09.672 --> 1:34:12.255
-[Teddy] Oh, this is yours.
-[Kate] This is yours.

1:34:17.588 --> 1:34:18.422
[Mom] Ah!

1:34:19.922 --> 1:34:21.797
It hurts my eyes. [laughs]

1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:24.505
Aunt Peggy sure outdid herself this year.

1:34:26.088 --> 1:34:27.213
What are those two?

1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:33.213
It's from Santa!

1:34:35.088 --> 1:34:36.088
It's for you.

1:34:38.255 --> 1:34:41.005
I was kinda worried you weren't going
to make the cut this year.

1:34:41.505 --> 1:34:44.588
Yeah. Guess I kinda worked it out
in the final hour.

1:34:47.005 --> 1:34:49.213
-Oh boy!
-Yes!

1:34:50.088 --> 1:34:51.630
Just what I asked for.

1:34:51.713 --> 1:34:53.588
-[Mom] Oh!
-[Kate] Bones Brigade skateboard!

1:34:53.672 --> 1:34:55.213
-[Mom] It's the exact one?
-[Kate] Yes!

1:34:55.297 --> 1:34:57.172
-[Mom] Nice.
-[Kate chuckles]

1:34:57.255 --> 1:34:58.172
[Mom] That's awesome.

1:34:59.172 --> 1:35:00.422
What's that?

1:35:01.463 --> 1:35:02.797
Santa wrote me back.

1:35:05.338 --> 1:35:06.880
You wrote Santa a letter?

1:35:07.130 --> 1:35:11.338
Yeah, I did. [chuckles]
Figured I'd cover all the bases.

1:35:12.713 --> 1:35:13.963
Well, what's it say?

1:35:15.505 --> 1:35:17.880
"Dear Teddy, I got your letter.

1:35:17.963 --> 1:35:21.547
I'm sorry, I don't really have the power
to grant your wish.

1:35:21.963 --> 1:35:23.797
This was the best I could do.

1:35:24.172 --> 1:35:25.088
Santa."

1:35:34.797 --> 1:35:36.213
An old ornament...

1:35:37.672 --> 1:35:38.963
Well, that's sweet.

1:35:40.463 --> 1:35:42.797
There's a perfect spot for it on the tree.

1:35:50.172 --> 1:35:52.088
-So, you're gonna wear a helmet with this?
-Yes.

1:35:52.172 --> 1:35:53.047
Let's see.

They get excited at the drop of a hat.

1:37:44.130 --> 1:37:46.713
Were you just a little bit naughty
last night?

Oh, I... [scoffs]
