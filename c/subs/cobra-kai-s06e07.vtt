-[Daniel] Remember to stay focused.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.688
Don't be afraid. Get in there.
Get in there. Be aggressive.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.898
[Daniel] Just take it slow.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.317
[Johnny] No, not take it slow.
We gotta go after 'em.

-Slow down.

01:19.704 --> 01:23.041
Johnny, will you let me sensei too?
They need to stay balanced.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.086
[Johnny] Well, we need to start going big,
or we're goin' home.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.964
[announcer] Miguel Diaz of Miyagi-Do

[Daniel] Everyone, listen up.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.553
All right, this morning's event was tough,

02:16.636 --> 02:18.680
but let's not get discouraged just yet.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.265
We have two more events today.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.308
Eliminations don't begin
till the second one.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.518
[Demetri] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.687
If that wasn't the elimination round,
what is?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.814
Getting our heads cut off with swords?

02:27.897 --> 02:29.607
We knew this wasn't gonna be easy.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.277
We're going up against
the best dojos in the world,

02:32.360 --> 02:33.653
but don't forget

02:34.445 --> 02:36.114
you guys are one of 'em too.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.241
Yeah, so start fighting like it.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.617
[Daniel] Johnny, come on, man.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.078
The best thing you can do right now

02:42.162 --> 02:45.957
is just clear your minds, get some rest,
you know, put this behind you.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.792
You got this, all right?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.335
I believe in you.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.213
All right, let's go.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.633
Hey, listen, I'm gonna go
check in on Chozen.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.970
Why bother? The way he's been puking
all morning, he won't be up all day.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.556
I still don't get
why he thinks drinking himself sick

03:01.639 --> 03:03.141
is gonna get him over his heartbreak.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.518
'Cause people don't always
take the right approach.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.979
-Like the way you've been sensei-ing.
-Here we go.

03:08.062 --> 03:11.065
You tell them to take it easy
when they're getting buried alive.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.902
Yelling at them
will not make them fight better, okay?

03:13.985 --> 03:15.612
They need encouragement and focus.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.030
They need points.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.489
This is a tournament, remember?

03:18.573 --> 03:21.492
If we end up at the bottom of the rankings
going into the elimination round,

03:21.576 --> 03:22.827
we might as well say adios.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.330
Johnny, we cannot keep arguing like this.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.457
Not if we wanna beat these other dojos.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.959
The Iron Dragons have fighters
from around the world.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.003
Their sensei is a former three-time champ.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.088
I don't care. He's a pussy.
I'm not scared of him.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.591
Yeah, well,
he's certainly not gonna be scared of us,

03:36.674 --> 03:39.385
seeing that we can't even figure out
how to sensei together.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.639
I've been letting you do your
go-take-a-nap-find-your-balance bullshit,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.349
but clearly it's not working.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.893
How do you expect these kids
to master Miyagi-Do

03:46.976 --> 03:49.229
if one of their senseis
keeps calling it bullshit?

03:49.312 --> 03:51.397
Know what's bullshit?
Letting them keep losing

03:51.481 --> 03:53.775
'cause you care more
about honoring some dead guy's legacy

03:53.858 --> 03:55.735
than doing what'll actually help them win.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.279
[woman] Mr. LaRusso?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.994
-Someone left this for you.
-[Daniel] Thank you.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.670
Holy shit.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.714
[Johnny] What? Is that the bill
from the minibar? Chozen should pay.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.635
-No. I gotta go. This is important.
-More important than the tournament?

04:20.718 --> 04:23.805
We still have a few hours.
I'll be back before the next event.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.934
All right. Don't come back
until you get your damn head on straight.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.852
[Kreese] Well, what do we have here?

04:29.936 --> 04:31.437
Someone's in a hurry.

04:33.690 --> 04:38.027
What, are you running away
after your dojo's brilliant performance?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.701
Well, I totally sucked out there.

04:45.743 --> 04:46.953
We all did terribly.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.581
Yeah, but I landed flat on my ass.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.627
God, I can't believe I'm making
such an embarrassment of myself.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.588
It would help
if our senseis got on the same page.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.632
Johnny needs to start
working with my dad better.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.680
Well, I mean, I don't think
it was all Sensei Lawrence's fault.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.185
What's up, everyone?
It's your queen of karate here.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.229
Just finished
our second Sekai Taikai event,

05:13.313 --> 05:16.482
where the Dragons absolutely slayed.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.109
Although it was awesome

05:18.192 --> 05:20.820
to see other badass girls of karate
fighting out there.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.618
Anyway, let's see if any of these
other dojos there try to dethrone us.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.748
And to all my fans,
I'm here to win for you.

05:32.290 --> 05:35.543
So stay tuned.
I'll post again after the next event.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.003
Zara out.

05:40.631 --> 05:44.802
Sorry, I only do intros on my stories
for fighters who win their events.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.889
It's a brand thing,
so don't take it personally.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.654
What if we just skip
the rest of the events?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.741
Hit Las Ramblas, pick up some churros?

06:06.824 --> 06:08.493
What? You're already giving up?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.787
Okay, well, let's be realistic here.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.455
There's no way that we can win.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.291
At this point, I'd rather not lose
any more brain cells.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.462
Oh my God, we get it. You're going to MIT.
Let them know about your rank-ass farts.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.339
No, no. [sputters] That was not me.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.341
Just saying.
Whoever denied it supplied it.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.509
[mutters]

06:26.177 --> 06:28.096
Hey, Miguel, dude. You okay?

06:29.305 --> 06:30.473
You fought really good.

06:31.224 --> 06:35.103
Thanks, bro. Yeah, I'm… I'm good,
but I don't know about Robby, man.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.523
I don't know what's going on in his head
but he's not fighting the same.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.109
He's probably bummed out
about Tory being on Cobra Kai.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.320
He needs to get over it. At this rate,
it's not gonna matter if we advance

06:44.404 --> 06:46.614
'cause he's gonna be
fighting for us in the finals.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.573
We're screwed.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.075
[shower stops]

06:49.659 --> 06:53.830
I don't know if it means anything, but…
we all think it should be you out there.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.332
It's true. Yeah.

06:57.083 --> 06:57.917
[door opens]

07:05.967 --> 07:06.801
What?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.345
Uh, nothing, no.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.933
Uh, we were just sleuthing the cold case
of who cut the cheese last night.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.894
And as we all know, whoever smelt it…

07:16.978 --> 07:17.854
[snaps fingers]

07:17.937 --> 07:18.771
…dealt it.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.815
[scoffs]

07:27.155 --> 07:29.949
Wait, so let me get this straight, Daniel.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.617
You're on your way to meet

07:31.701 --> 07:34.745
some mysterious,
potentially dangerous fighter

07:34.829 --> 07:37.457
in the middle of a country
where you don't speak the language?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.667
Hablo un poco de español.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.545
-Plus, I have Google Translate.
-[Amanda] Daniel, don't be cute.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.048
I thought we agreed to move on
from digging into Mr. Miyagi's past.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.259
That's before I learned
about the headband.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.637
Oh, so now we're letting
ancient karate apparel drive our choices.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.306
[Daniel] When I first met Mr. Miyagi,

07:53.389 --> 07:55.057
he told me he was against tournaments.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.853
Now I find out he probably fought
in the biggest one in the world

07:58.936 --> 08:01.147
during a time of his life
he never spoke about.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.567
His wife and newborn child had just died.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.988
Well… I can only imagine
what he was going through.

08:09.071 --> 08:13.242
I know. If this guy knew Mr. Miyagi,
he could shed some light on what happened.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.912
I mean, come on,
I gotta at least talk to him.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.122
Look, I get it, but just… [sighs]

08:18.664 --> 08:19.999
Couldn't this have waited?

08:20.791 --> 08:22.710
I thought you had two more events today.

08:22.793 --> 08:26.506
This is when Serrano could meet.
It's not far. I'm gonna be back in time.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.635
Who knows? I may get some insights
that could help with the tournament.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.512
Just be careful.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.263
Love you.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.848
I will. I love you too.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
[ominous music plays]

08:43.731 --> 08:45.107
[in Spanish] Address is up there.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.319
Are you sure it's correct?
Tourists don't come here.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.279
Sí.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.032
[in English] I shouldn't be long.
Do you mind waiting here?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.492
Espera aquí?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.044
Hey, hey!

09:06.295 --> 09:07.505
I said wait!

09:08.172 --> 09:10.174
[ominous music plays]

09:12.093 --> 09:12.927
[music fades]

09:13.511 --> 09:15.179
I'll take one of those muffin thingies.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.642
Magdalena.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.937
-What did you call me?
-It's what you're eating.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.108
[in Catalan] I'll take four eggs,
hold the yolks. And no salt.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.406
[in English] Hey, you know what? You're
not the only one who speaks Spanish.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.949
Yo también.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.703
[chuckles] Actually, it's, uh, Catalan.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.123
That is what they speak here in Barcelona.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.874
It's "Barss-elona," dipshit.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.835
Of course it is.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.005
Why you gotta be
such a pain in the ass at every buffet?

09:49.088 --> 09:51.215
Well, because
how we fuel our bodies matter.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.301
I teach my students by example

09:53.384 --> 09:56.971
to eat nutrients
rich in protein and antioxidants

09:57.054 --> 09:58.598
so they perform at their peak.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.977
Maybe where you're from,
they only eat crap like this.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.896
You don't know shit about me
or where I come from.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.732
I know Americans.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.276
Coddled, arrogant,

10:10.359 --> 10:11.527
privileged.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.072
You have no idea
what it is like to sacrifice,

10:15.156 --> 10:16.949
what it's like to go hungry.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.117
Even for one meal.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.745
Everything in your life is empty calories.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.663
Then maybe it's true.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.498
You are what you eat.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.210
Yeah? I'm gonna take these empty calories,
and I'm gonna shove it right up your--

The next event will begin in 90 minutes.

Good news is your dojo won't be around
much longer to waste everyone's time,

10:36.844 --> 10:38.304
as you'll be eliminated tonight.

Bullshit. You just better hope
you don't run into us out there.

about where we come from.

I'm getting worried. Please call me.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.488
I was looking for my dad. Seen him?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.991
He stepped out.
Guess he got caught up or something.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.784
It's probably for the best.

[official] In this final points round,

12:26.245 --> 12:30.166

their opponents off their platforms.

Once you have fallen, you are out.

off of wins, losses, and time.

12:38.674 --> 12:42.052

in tonight's elimination round.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.389
We will now call up
the first group of fighters.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.641
[Johnny] All right. Listen up.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.353
Looks like I'm taking charge,
so we're doing things differently.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.898
No more waiting around
like scared little bitches,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.733
waiting for them to come to you.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.612
All right? You go at them.
Aggressive. Knock 'em off first.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.949
Those platforms are pretty narrow.
My dad would want balance.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.285
Yeah, well, your dad's not here.
All right?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.204
It's time for us
to start scoring some points.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.458

13:16.086 --> 13:17.797

13:19.298 --> 13:21.008
All right. Don't let me down, Lee.

but you can't do this.

I'm an American.
There must be some kind of mistake.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.386
No mistake.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.055
This was planned? You work for Serrano?

14:50.764 --> 14:53.225
I just need to ask him
a question about my sensei.

Sensei?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.286
Sensei, did you see that knee?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.705
[Johnny] It's too little, too late, man.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.334
We're near the bottom of the standings.
There's nothing to celebrate here.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.503
What?

16:05.339 --> 16:07.216
Hey! Where the hell
you think you're going?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.885
Back to the hotel
to wash off this disgrace.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.513
You're not getting off that easy.
Locker room. Now.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.938
What I saw from you just now,

16:21.021 --> 16:22.231
it wasn't karate.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.608
It was weakness.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.236
You fought like little lambs
waiting for slaughter.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.782
We keep going like this,
we get eliminated tonight.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.284
Some of you will put this behind you.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.579
But some of you are gonna carry this
for the rest of your lives.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.376
Knowing you had this chance
to make something of yourselves.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.629
But instead, you crumbled under pressure.

16:46.547 --> 16:51.343
And you're gonna go on to live shit lives
in shitty apartments with shit jobs.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.638
And always have to live with this failure.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.475
So if you wanna save some humiliation,

16:58.559 --> 17:01.729
why don't we just skip the next round
and catch the next flight home?

17:01.812 --> 17:03.897
[melancholy music plays]

What is wrong with you guys?

Where's your fight?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.864
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourselves?

17:11.947 --> 17:13.949
You keep blaming us
like this isn't on you too.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.994
If my Dad had been there,
we never would've lost like that.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.288
-Yeah, well, he didn't show up.
-Probably because of you.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.375
You keep disrespecting him,
trying to prove your way is better,

17:23.459 --> 17:25.669
when it's so clear
that we should've been using Miyagi-Do.

17:28.005 --> 17:32.259
-You shouldn't even be wearing that gi.
-Hey! Don't talk to my sensei like that.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.720
Your sensei got you knocked off the board
in ten seconds.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.055
I would sit down if I were you.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.766
You're not helping us. I don't even know
how you made this team.

17:41.977 --> 17:46.482
Well, I, for one, will be putting
all of this behind me when I'm off to MI--

17:46.565 --> 17:48.484
Shut the fuck up about MIT.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.738
Some of us care about winning
the tournament. Be nice if you did too.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.449
Guys, can we cool it? This isn't helping.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.825
We need to focus up.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.370
Maybe you should listen
to your own advice.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.290
Got something to say?

18:05.709 --> 18:06.585
I already did.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.214
[Johnny] Hey, I'm not finished.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.591
No offense, but I'm pretty sure
we've heard enough from you.

to get here so badly.

To… to prove to you and everyone
that I'm a badass,

19:57.237 --> 19:59.531
but I ended up doing something I regret.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.744
And I hurt someone.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.871
[crying] And… and… and for what?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.664
I knew I couldn't beat Kenny,

20:07.748 --> 20:09.666
so I had to cheat
to make sure I would win.

and I'm getting demolished out there.

I'd done something I regret,

I'd be a gajillionaire.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.906
One thing I'll never regret is
all the work I put into students like you.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.617
I've been putting
a lot of pressure on you lately,

20:43.700 --> 20:46.662
so I'll take my share of the blame
for this Kenny situation.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.414
If I ever pushed you beyond your limits,

20:49.498 --> 20:51.708
it's because I know
you're capable of more than you think.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.963
I'll always have your back. All right?
So don't think about regret right now.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.255
You have the opportunity of a lifetime
to be captain,

25:07.339 --> 25:08.423
and you're blowing it.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.801
You've lost every one of your matches.
It's like you don't even care.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.140
It hasn't exactly been the easiest for me.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.559
It was never supposed to be easy, okay?

25:19.643 --> 25:22.187
You knew being captain
would've changed my life.

25:22.938 --> 25:26.107
Well, it's not all about you, dude.
It can change my life too.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.735
Hold a grudge all you want,
but I won it fair and square.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.405
Sure. But you're also gonna be the reason
we go home with nothing.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.824
So either man up

25:35.575 --> 25:37.786
or admit I'm fighting better than you
and hand it over.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.633
[suspenseful music plays]

25:51.716 --> 25:56.346
We have now entered
the elimination phase of the Sekai Taikai.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.391
The dojos who do not win tonight
will be headed home.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.728
The previous rounds
have determined your current rankings.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.232
The number one team
will face the number 16 team.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.777
The number two team
will face the number 15 team,

26:10.860 --> 26:12.237
and so on and so on.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.241
Okay, that means at number 12,
we're facing number five, Dublin Thunder.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.619
Oh, great. I heard they started a fight
with some locals at the beach.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.621
They're always looking for a brawl.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.957
[announcer 1] Now,
for the rules of the event.

26:24.040 --> 26:28.253
Fighters will again face off
on a platform.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.588
[suspenseful music plays]

26:29.671 --> 26:30.714
This platform.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.552
But this time,

26:35.635 --> 26:39.598
two fighters from each dojo
are allowed at one time.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.724
[buzzer blares]

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
[dramatic music plays]

26:43.059 --> 26:45.020
[announcer 1] If one
of your fighters falls…

26:45.520 --> 26:47.230
-[fighter 1 yells]
-[fighter 2 grunts]

26:47.314 --> 26:48.648
[announcer 1] …they are out.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.109
[laughter]

26:51.860 --> 26:55.947
[announcer 1] But another teammate
can climb up to take their place.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.326
[yells]

26:59.409 --> 27:01.328
[announcer 1] However,
the fight never stops.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.662
So get up there quick

27:02.746 --> 27:05.373
to not leave
your teammate alone two-on-one.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.917
[grunting]

27:12.714 --> 27:14.257
[fighter groans]

27:14.341 --> 27:17.177
[announcer 1] When all the fighters
of a dojo have been knocked off,

27:17.260 --> 27:18.595
the team is out.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.848
[announcer 2] Advancing to the next round,
the Iron Dragons!

27:21.931 --> 27:23.350
[yells]

27:23.433 --> 27:25.518
Was this dude made in a lab?

27:25.602 --> 27:28.813
He's like a mix between the Winter Soldier
and Frankenstein's monster.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.565
Don't call him a monster.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.485
You don't know him or what he deals with.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.237
[dramatic music plays]

27:36.321 --> 27:37.739
[woman] We love you, Zara.

27:38.865 --> 27:42.118
[announcer 2] Next up, Korea's Cobra Kai
versus Sweden's Polarslaget.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.416

27:52.629 --> 27:54.130
[Kwon yells]

27:54.214 --> 27:56.633
[dramatic music plays]

28:04.891 --> 28:08.478
[announcer 2] Wow. Impressive performance
by Tory Nichols of Cobra Kai.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.438
They advance to the next round.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.276
Yes!

28:18.279 --> 28:24.536
[crowd] Tory! Tory!
Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory!

28:26.079 --> 28:29.666
[announcer 2] Next on the platform,
Dublin Thunder versus Miyagi-Do.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.511
Hey.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.057
I know I didn't act like it before,
but I wish your dad was here too.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.268
I'm sure he's okay.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.688
I'll do my best
to fill his shoes until he's back.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.190
Yes, Sensei.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.567
All right.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.611
All right, let's bring it in.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.363
I got something to say.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.950
It's been a tough day.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.830
Probably shouldn't have been such a dick
to all of you, but I want you to know

29:08.913 --> 29:11.583
that I believe with every bone in my body
that you can do this.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.960
You guys know
a lot more about balance than me,

29:14.043 --> 29:16.171
so remember everything Sensei LaRusso said

29:16.254 --> 29:18.590
and use all your Miyagi-Do skills
to stay up there.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.924
[Miguel] Yeah, let's go.

29:20.008 --> 29:23.344
I'm thinking we should start strong
with our captains. Sam.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.305
Robby.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.932
Devon, you'll go next.

29:28.016 --> 29:28.975
Hawk, Demetri.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.311
And Miguel's our anchor.

29:32.687 --> 29:33.730
Let's do this.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.815
[suspenseful music plays]

29:40.779 --> 29:44.657
[Johnny] Come on, LaRusso.
Let's go, Robby. You guys got this.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.646

30:54.394 --> 30:56.312
Hell yeah! More of that.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.444
Think you're so tough?
Well, I'll show you tough, bitch. [grunts]

[dramatic music continues]

31:08.700 --> 31:09.701

All right. Go get 'em, kid.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.356
Nice sacrifice.

[announcer 2] Incredible performance
from Miyagi-Do's Miguel Diaz.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.621
His triumph sends Miyagi-Do
to the next round.

Hey, Rosa.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.914
You won't believe what just happened.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.625
Wait. What? Slow down. Slow down.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.096
Well, well, well.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.974
You were missed at the events today.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.187
Did you, uh, get yourself
caught up in something?

34:26.773 --> 34:28.483
Think you can fuck with me?

34:29.275 --> 34:31.069
Take it easy, Danny boy.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.655
It's only a tournament.

Dad?

34:37.450 --> 34:39.077
Sam. Sam.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.123
I'm so sorry I wasn't here today.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.336
I was so worried. Where were you?

34:48.419 --> 34:49.253
[Daniel] I, um…

34:51.464 --> 34:52.840
I, uh, wish I had a good reason.

34:54.217 --> 34:58.221
I went out for lunch. I got in a… a cab,
and we… we, um…

34:58.721 --> 35:00.932
It's a long story. Okay?

35:01.516 --> 35:02.725
But how'd we do here?

35:03.559 --> 35:05.603
It was… rough.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.606
But… we made it through to the next round.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.358
Good.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.944
I… I promise I will

35:14.153 --> 35:15.530
not let you down again.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.531
Okay?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.999
Hey, listen, Johnny. I got your voice--

35:28.793 --> 35:30.753
-What's going on?
-I got a call from Rosa.

35:30.837 --> 35:35.466
Carmen's been rushed to the hospital.
Something went wrong with the pregnancy.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.384
What?

35:37.051 --> 35:39.220
When? Uh, is she gonna be okay?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.304
I don't know.

35:41.430 --> 35:45.184
I talked to Miguel. We're leaving tonight.
I haven't told the others.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.520
I'll take care of it.
Just focus on getting there.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.771
Leave everything to me.

35:48.855 --> 35:49.689
All right.
