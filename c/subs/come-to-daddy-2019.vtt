[door unlocks]

05:15.849 --> 05:19.818
Dad, it's me, Norval.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.858
Uh, I got your letter.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.831
Your letter asking me
to come and see you.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.535
Well...

05:38.672 --> 05:39.771
here I am.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.376
It's me. Norval.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.649
-[gasps] Mm.
-Okay.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.620
Jesus Christ.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.025
I never thought
I'd see you again.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.098
[chuckles]

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
Well, you wanna come in?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.576
Yes, please.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.850
[dad] Welcome to my house.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.453
[Norval] I like it.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.855
[dad scoffs]
You don't.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.757
[Norval] I do.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.726
[dad] Why?

06:36.397 --> 06:40.932
Uh, it's like a UFO
from the 1960's.

06:41.802 --> 06:45.437
A UFO from the 1960's.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.471
[Norval] Yeah.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.977
A UFO from the 1960's.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.479
Exactly.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.617
That's brilliant.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.653
Yeah.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.156
When did I last see you, son?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.426
[Norval] I don't know.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.760
Oh, come on.
How long's it been?

07:10.831 --> 07:11.897
A long time.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.100
A long time, yeah.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.736
Too long.

07:17.738 --> 07:21.173
[dad] Too fucking long.
God damn.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.709
-Yeah. Mm.
-[dad clears throat]

07:25.879 --> 07:26.912
Yeah.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.689
Let's get you unpacked.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.139
Hey.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.975
Let's get a picture of us.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.879
You know, a selfie photo?

08:03.550 --> 08:05.684
You can show it to your mom
when you get home.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.022
Oh.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.664
No, no. You gotta get
the sea in there.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.235
-Come on, here.
-[Norval] Uh, careful.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.036
That's a limited edition
gold phone,

08:25.038 --> 08:26.171
designed by Lorde.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.507
[dad] Lorde?
never heard of him.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.675
[Norval] It's real gold.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.911
There we go.
How about that, huh?

08:32.913 --> 08:36.014
Okay. Smile.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.950
-[camera clicks]
-[Norval] Oh, shit.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.589
-[dad] Well...
-[Norval] Fuck.

08:44.591 --> 08:48.727
Well, I should've never had
that second beer for breakfast.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.963
There are only twenty
of those phones in the world.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.699
[dad] Yeah.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.203
No. Now there's nineteen.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.908
[wind chimes tinkling]

09:05.178 --> 09:06.778
[thudding]

09:07.948 --> 09:10.615
So, how's your mother?

09:12.853 --> 09:14.286
Not great, actually.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.755
Oh?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.892
She ever talk about me?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.828
Not really.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.599
[dad] You live with her?

09:27.601 --> 09:31.636
Yeah,
it's a temporary arrangement.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.608
[dad] You don't feel
embarrassed about that?

09:39.179 --> 09:42.080
Living with your mom?
At your age?

09:42.849 --> 09:43.982
I don't know.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.252
I've had a rough few years.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.854
She helped me get me
back on my feet.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.591
-It's complicated.
-[thud]

09:55.362 --> 09:56.928
[dad] You sleep with her?

09:58.865 --> 09:59.998
What?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.734
[dad] Do you share a bed
with your mom?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.003
No.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.339
[dad laughs]

10:12.679 --> 10:13.678
[sizzling]

10:13.680 --> 10:15.080
[dad] Yeah.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.047
[chuckles]

10:22.789 --> 10:24.823
-Wine?
-[Norval] No, thanks.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.893
Oh, go on. Have a drink
with your old man.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.061
I-- I don't drink.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.131
No?

10:35.736 --> 10:37.235
Why is that?

10:39.773 --> 10:43.074
I've had what's called
"alcohol dependency issues".

10:44.311 --> 10:47.345
[dad] Yeah?
And that is, uh...

10:47.347 --> 10:49.981
It's when you're dependent
on alcohol.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.721
I nearly...

11:03.797 --> 11:06.865
I wrote a note, I ran a bath...

11:08.301 --> 11:09.768
I came close.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.370
Really fucking close.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.784
Anyway, here I am. I survived.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.120
[dad] Mm-hmm.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.103
Hmm.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.175
[slurps]

11:56.717 --> 11:59.718
Mm, wow.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.491
Tempted?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.127
No.

12:10.997 --> 12:14.199
[music playing]

12:19.172 --> 12:20.739
So, Dad...

12:22.275 --> 12:23.475
what do you do?

12:24.811 --> 12:25.910
For work?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.946
[dad] I'm retired.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.815
What did you do
before you retired?

12:30.817 --> 12:33.485
I realize I know nothing
about you.

12:33.487 --> 12:38.823
Boy. Your mom, she really
doesn't talk about me, does she?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.331
I was a limo driver.

12:47.768 --> 12:52.470
Yeah, I drove
a big black limousine.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.973
With a fridge in the back...

12:56.343 --> 12:58.309
real leather seats.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.981
It was an award-winning
limousine.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.951
I've been in a few
limousines myself.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.521
I'm in the music business.

13:09.523 --> 13:10.955
Okay.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.325
I'm fairly big
in the music business.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.127
Oh, I bet you are.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.464
What are you?
A singer or something?

13:21.468 --> 13:24.869
Well... I'm not someone
you can pigeonhole,

13:24.871 --> 13:26.805
if I'm completely honest.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.275
Do I DJ? Yes.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.412
Do I produce blazing beats? Yes.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.515
Do I tinkle the ivories? Yes.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.119
Do I promote high-profile
events pertaining to music

13:41.121 --> 13:43.555
and the performance of music?
Yes.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.091
Okay.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.496
I'm close to some
pretty big names.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.464
Substantial names, actually.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.501
I count Kendrick Lamar
and Chance the Rapper

13:56.503 --> 13:58.169
among my closest allies.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.939
Anyone I've actually heard of?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.910
Uh, Elton John
is a close friend.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.380
His real name
is Reginald Kenneth Dwight.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.953
Elton-- Reginald discovered me.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.956
He saw me DJing at a nightclub.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.292
It was a gala event,
and I was the DJ.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.128
He signed me
to an exclusive deal.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.098
We inked the deal
that same night.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.201
Elton-- Uh, Reginald...
[chuckles]

14:31.304 --> 14:32.470
...he's a great man.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.074
You could say he's like
a father to me.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.343
No offence.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.447
Boy, I'll tell you.
It's a small world.

14:44.417 --> 14:49.954
I just happen to be a close
friend of Reginald's too.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.227
-You are?
-[Dad] Yeah.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.464
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.467
-[Norval] You are.
-I'm really not.

15:03.603 --> 15:08.139
No. Reginald and I,
oh, we go way back.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.641
Really?

15:09.643 --> 15:13.645
[dad] I was his personal
limo driver for 10 years.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.248
Yeah.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.287
We spent a decade together.

15:23.523 --> 15:27.959
Reginald and I,
driving, drinking, talking.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.263
We became close friends.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.501
Now, what are the odds

15:36.503 --> 15:41.005
that you would be
close friends with him too?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.010
Yeah.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.280
Small world.
[chuckles]

15:51.017 --> 15:54.285
-So, anyway--
-I'll tell you what...

15:56.056 --> 15:57.155
[Norval] What?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.324
Let's call him.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.293
-Reginald?
-[Dad] Yeah.

16:02.295 --> 16:07.031
It'll blow his fucking mind.
Are you kidding?

16:08.001 --> 16:10.234
Brian and Norval,
his old pals

16:10.236 --> 16:13.204
just happen to be
father and son, oh.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.073
-Incredible.
-Uh, I don't know, Dad.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.042
It-- It's late.
He goes to bed early.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.444
Bullshit.

16:19.446 --> 16:23.047
He's a card-carrying night owl,
and he never shuts up about it.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.016
He told me to never call him
after 8:00.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.618
Well, he told me to call
him any time, night or day.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.592
Dad, please, don't call him.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.664
Please. Don't call him, Dad.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.535
Please!

16:52.779 --> 16:55.513
You don't really know
Elton John, do you?

16:59.686 --> 17:00.752
Do you?

17:08.428 --> 17:09.494
Uh...

17:09.496 --> 17:12.630
No. I-- I don't really know
Elton John.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.671
As a matter of fact,
neither do I.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.176
[laughs]

17:26.346 --> 17:28.579
But I'm glad
we've established

17:28.581 --> 17:30.648
that you're full of shit.

17:59.379 --> 18:03.815
Just so you know,
if you want to impress me,

18:04.818 --> 18:07.351
I like fight stories.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.488
[Norval spits]

18:11.691 --> 18:13.357
You ever been in a fight?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.093
[Norval] No.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.761
I have.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.701
I once accidentally kicked
a guy's ear off.

18:23.703 --> 18:28.172
I didn't mean to,
but the fucker flew off.

18:28.174 --> 18:32.376
I could see
right into his skull.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.483
Night.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.758

<i> Let me talk here.</i>

[wind chimes tinkling]

19:16.422 --> 19:18.789
<i> No, come on. That's not...</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:22.894
<i> You know we can use him</i>
<i> as fucking leverage.</i>

19:24.597 --> 19:26.397
<i> We've got some collateral.</i>

19:27.867 --> 19:30.201

19:30.637 --> 19:31.869

[door closes]

20:27.360 --> 20:29.527
[Norval] Dad,
can I ask you something?

20:31.397 --> 20:32.997
Why did you ask me
to come here?

20:35.235 --> 20:37.835
You sent me a letter
asking me to come. But...

20:37.837 --> 20:42.573
now I'm here and you seem like
you'd rather I wasn't.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.678
It's like you regret
sending that letter.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.782
Maybe I'm wrong.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.687
Am I wrong?

21:05.398 --> 21:06.998
I've got to take a crap.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.801
[sniffs] Then,
let's go for a swim.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.650

21:27.854 --> 21:29.854

21:31.291 --> 21:32.390

21:34.894 --> 21:36.761
Oh, that's great.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.432
[sighs]
I don't know.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.601
It's harder than I thought.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.305
He's not how I imagined him.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.310
<i> Not at all.</i>

21:54.814 --> 21:57.081
<i> Uh, I don't think</i>
<i> he sees many people.</i>

22:03.056 --> 22:06.424
<i> Maybe he's not</i>
<i>used to having people around.</i>

22:09.329 --> 22:11.329
[breathes heavily].

22:11.331 --> 22:12.930

22:59.045 --> 23:00.444
<i> He's dead.</i>

23:01.781 --> 23:03.881
<i> Well, he's fuckin' dead.</i>

23:08.454 --> 23:10.855
<i> No. I don't want</i>
<i> to be a fucking babysitter.</i>

23:21.667 --> 23:24.068
[Brian breathes heavily]

23:30.977 --> 23:32.143
Mm.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.013
Dad.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.882
[grunts]

23:38.484 --> 23:39.550
Dad?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.786
Yeah.

23:41.788 --> 23:45.022
I need to know
why you sent that letter.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.459
Give it a rest.

23:48.461 --> 23:51.462
Dad, I came all this way.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.897
No.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.767
I don't want to discuss it.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.439
This is hard for me too,
you know.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.606
Fucking drop it.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.913
I don't want to fucking drop it.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.651
What did you say to me?

24:13.653 --> 24:16.921
-I said--
-You said?

24:16.923 --> 24:20.024
I said, I don't want
to fucking drop it.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.828
You watch
how you talk to me, boy.

24:23.830 --> 24:27.064
You asked me to come here.
Here I am.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.666
Yeah?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.534
-And?
-And...

24:30.536 --> 24:32.736
you have some explaining to do.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.940
[sighs]

24:37.610 --> 24:38.542
Like what?

24:38.544 --> 24:40.911
You walked out on us
when I was five.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.614
Thirty years later you ask me
to come and see you.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.849
Here-- here I am.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.852
I came here
because I assumed

24:47.854 --> 24:49.954
that at some point you were
going to explain yourself.

24:49.956 --> 24:54.625
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.594
I disagree.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.029
Do you?

25:00.633 --> 25:02.266
Yeah.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.900
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

25:05.771 --> 25:08.672
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.074
Hmm?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.043
I know what's happening.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.112
[laughs]
Yeah? Trust me.

25:15.114 --> 25:18.682
You got no fucking idea
what's happening here.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.917
I think I do.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.086
[Brian] Oh, fuck off.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.122
You wrote that letter
when you were drunk.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.792
You probably don't
even remember sending it.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.127
Fuck off.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.864
You're a drunk.
That's all you are.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.851
A useless drunk.

25:36.852 --> 25:39.837
-You can't handle your booze.
-You can't handle being a dad.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.305
[Brian] Oh.
[scoffs]

25:41.307 --> 25:43.941
I've been trying
so fucking hard to like you...

25:44.644 --> 25:46.043
but it's impossible.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.012
You're impossible.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.580
Fuck off.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.649
[Norval] You fuck off.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.853
No! You fuck off!

25:57.323 --> 25:59.223
You're a rat fucker.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.760
You stuff rats
up your vagina.

26:02.762 --> 26:07.264
You dress like a woman, yeah?
You dress like a cunt.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.567
-Please, don't call me that.
-Then why?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.968
You're very cunty.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.937
-Don't say that.
-Oh!

26:12.939 --> 26:18.042
Well, I call a spade a spade,
and a cunt a cunt.

26:18.044 --> 26:22.813
And you, sir,
are a certified cunt.

26:22.815 --> 26:27.651
Did you really think
that I would be impressed

26:27.653 --> 26:31.121
with your fucking
Elton John story?

26:31.123 --> 26:35.926
Only a cunt would think that.
Cunt!

26:35.928 --> 26:38.128
-Cunt!
-Please, don't push me.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.763
[Brian] Oh, yeah, what?

26:41.734 --> 26:42.833
What?

26:42.835 --> 26:44.234
-I'll leave.
-Oh, no.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.303
No, you're not going anywhere.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.738
I think I might just go.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.940
[Brian] Yeah.
[chuckles]

26:49.941 --> 26:52.141
Well, you'd get lost
in the woods and die.

26:52.144 --> 26:55.245
And they'd find a rat skeleton

26:55.247 --> 26:59.650
inside your pelvic bone
where your vagina was.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.621
You'd love that,
wouldn't you, Dad?

27:03.623 --> 27:04.956
Oh, fuck.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.290
[Norval] You'd love it
if I was dead.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.692
Oh, God. Fucking damn it!

27:10.196 --> 27:13.097
[breathes heavily]

27:21.140 --> 27:22.873
[exhales]

27:27.713 --> 27:29.813
Dad! What the fuck
are you doing?

27:29.815 --> 27:33.984
I believe
the correct term is filicide.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.254
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Come on.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.723
Oh, come here,
you little rat fucker!

27:39.725 --> 27:43.327
-Come here. Come to Daddy!
-Please, please don't do this.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.962
I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.131
Where's the fucking
gratitude here, huh?

27:47.133 --> 27:49.333
I thought you wanted to die.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.201
I-- I didn't. I don't. No, no.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.037
-Please, Dad, don't do this.
-[grunts]

27:53.039 --> 27:55.873
-Die!
-[grunting]

27:58.411 --> 28:00.177
No.
[grunts]

28:00.179 --> 28:01.145
Dad?

28:09.855 --> 28:11.021
Dad?

28:25.471 --> 28:27.304
<i> Mom, it's me.</i>

28:29.942 --> 28:32.309
<i> N-- No.</i>
<i> L-- Listen to me.</i>

28:33.412 --> 28:35.145
<i> It's Dad. He-- He's...</i>

28:35.147 --> 28:37.314
I-- I think he just died.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.717
H-- He just fell down.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.186
He just fell down
and stopped breathing.

28:42.188 --> 28:47.191
We-- we had an argument,
and-- and he just died.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.194
Friday?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.930
Um, okay. I'll see you Friday.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.267
Okay. Yep. Okay.
I-- I'll do that.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.498
<i> Coroner's office, please.</i>

29:32.938 --> 29:34.204
My dad's just died.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.194
[clattering]

30:02.067 --> 30:04.401
[breathes heavily].

30:28.360 --> 30:32.029
And there wasn't any,
like, um, struggle and stuff?

30:33.599 --> 30:38.202
No. No. Like I said, he--
He seemed fine. And...

30:38.204 --> 30:41.371
And he said his chest hurt.
He fell down--

30:41.373 --> 30:43.207
Do you promise
you're telling me the truth?

30:46.979 --> 30:49.546
No. You can't just nod.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.185
You've got to say it out loud.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.155
I promise I'm telling the truth.

31:06.465 --> 31:07.965
You know something?

31:09.168 --> 31:10.500
I believe you.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.439
You don't have raisin eyes.

31:15.441 --> 31:18.275
-What?
-[Ronald] Yeah, I'm kind of

31:18.277 --> 31:20.944
breaking the fourth wall here,
but, uh...

31:20.946 --> 31:23.013
I got this theory.

31:23.015 --> 31:26.216
Bad guys have eyes
that look like raisins.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.552
You know, small and dark,
you know?

31:28.554 --> 31:31.121
But you don't have raisin eyes.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.192
No. I-- I don't.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.168
Ooh.
[clicks tongue]

31:46.405 --> 31:47.671
Tell you something, though.

31:47.673 --> 31:52.142
Your daddy...
he did have raisin eyes.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.220
[Brian]<i> Come to Daddy.</i>

32:03.222 --> 32:06.456
That's just my
hallucinations on the subject

32:06.458 --> 32:08.392
of bad guys and their eyes.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.264
Yeah.
Coroner will take it from here.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.167
Yeah, I'm...

32:17.169 --> 32:20.037
I'm sorry about your dad
and stuff, you know.

32:20.039 --> 32:23.006
Take it easy, I guess.
Drink lots of water.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.143
[sighs]

32:26.145 --> 32:28.679
I can burp on command
if that might

32:28.681 --> 32:29.980
cheer you up.

32:31.517 --> 32:34.017
-No, that's okay.
-[burps]

32:41.160 --> 32:42.225
Okay.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.101
[Norval]<i> I don't think</i>
<i> I liked him.</i>

32:51.103 --> 32:52.336
[woman]<i> Really?</i>

32:52.338 --> 32:54.338
[Norval]<i> He called me</i>
<i> a rat fucker.</i>

32:55.140 --> 32:56.506
Amongst other things.

32:59.244 --> 33:00.544
Good thing he's dead then.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.214
Is that a really bad thing
to say?

33:05.184 --> 33:08.285
I don't know.
Yeah?

33:11.256 --> 33:12.322
Sorry.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.269
So, I'm gonna
take him away, embalm him,

33:26.271 --> 33:29.339
drain the blood from his body,
inject him with a preservative,

33:29.341 --> 33:31.708
so he doesn't go off,
and then bring him back here.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.410
What?

33:33.412 --> 33:36.446
Oh, there is a storage issue
in town at the moment

33:36.448 --> 33:37.514
from the flooding.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.116
Did you hear about that?

33:39.118 --> 33:40.183
No.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.720
He'll need to be here while
your family makes arrangements.

33:43.722 --> 33:47.424
He'll be in a black bag.
You won't have to look at him.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.502
Has anyone ever told you...

34:00.172 --> 34:01.371
Told me what?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.142
You have kind eyes.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.113
No. No one has
ever said that to me.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.348
[Gladys] Never?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.216
Not that I remember.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.252
Well, you do.

34:15.254 --> 34:18.288
They're big and they're kind.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.693
The-- the cop who came told me
I-- I didn't have raisin eyes.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.796
What are raisin eyes?

34:27.466 --> 34:29.399
Fucking idiot.
Raisin eyes?

34:29.401 --> 34:30.801
[scoffs]
I know.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.174
If you have any questions
just call me.

34:40.612 --> 34:41.678
Thanks.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.677
[Gladys]<i> How are you</i>
<i> holding up?</i>

36:21.947 --> 36:23.380
[Norval]<i> I'm fine.</i>

36:25.851 --> 36:27.484
<i> I never really knew him.</i>

36:28.687 --> 36:30.787
<i> So, it's hard to feel sad.</i>

36:33.859 --> 36:37.227
<i> Sad enough to actually cry</i>
<i> real emotional tears.</i>

36:38.263 --> 36:39.329
<i> But...</i>

36:41.366 --> 36:43.333

36:45.470 --> 36:46.770
<i> I feel something.</i>

36:49.208 --> 36:50.540
<i> I just don't know what.</i>

36:53.478 --> 36:55.278
[Gladys]<i> It does get easier.</i>

36:57.316 --> 36:58.415
[Norval]<i> Yeah.</i>

37:01.853 --> 37:04.554
Look. I...
I better get back to the office.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.691
Yeah.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.295
[Gladys]<i> This might sound</i>
<i> really weird, but...</i>

37:12.297 --> 37:13.863
you should talk to him.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.632
What?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.369
It helps, you know?

37:19.371 --> 37:21.504
When my husband died,

37:21.506 --> 37:25.308
I remember just yapping
onto him for an hour.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.577
All the things I wanted to say
when he was...

37:28.647 --> 37:29.713
Was here.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.750
I'm sure there's things you want
to say to your dad, too.

37:36.255 --> 37:37.787
Not that it's any
of my business.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.756
You can tell me to shut up,
if you want.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.858
No.
It's okay, really.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.362
I have no filter.

37:47.866 --> 37:48.965
I like it.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.037
Are you gonna be okay here?

37:56.475 --> 37:57.674
I hope so.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.544
Yeah, definitely.

38:04.349 --> 38:06.750
When your mom gets here,
we'll make further arrangements.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.022
Take care, Norval.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.294
Shut up!

42:16.768 --> 42:17.734
Shut up!

44:07.012 --> 44:09.245
I'm not listening!

44:21.760 --> 44:22.992
[Gladys]<i> Hello?</i>

44:22.994 --> 44:24.394
Gladys?

44:26.331 --> 44:27.930
[Gladys]<i> Yes?</i>
<i> Who is this?</i>

44:27.932 --> 44:29.265
Guess.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.668
[Gladys]
<i> Mister Greenwood?</i>

44:31.670 --> 44:32.869
Bingo.

44:32.871 --> 44:35.171
[Gladys]<i> Is there a problem</i>
<i> with your father?</i>

44:35.173 --> 44:36.906
There's a lot of problems
with my father,

44:36.908 --> 44:39.042
but that's not why I'm calling.

44:39.044 --> 44:41.411
[Gladys]
<i> What can I do for you?</i>

44:41.413 --> 44:45.348
Good question.
I need you to come over.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.216
[Gladys]<i> Mr. Greenwood,</i>
<i> are you--</i>

44:47.218 --> 44:49.185
Shh. Don't think.
Just come over.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.854
[Gladys]<i> You're going through</i>
<i> a difficult time.</i>

44:51.856 --> 44:53.423
-We had something.
-[Gladys]<i> No, we didn't.</i>

44:53.425 --> 44:55.391
-I know you felt it too.
-[Gladys]<i> No, I didn't.</i>

44:55.393 --> 44:57.126
We owe it to ourselves
to explore this.

44:57.128 --> 44:59.962
The smartest thing you could do
right now is jump in your car

44:59.964 --> 45:01.030
and...

45:03.935 --> 45:05.001
Please.

45:05.003 --> 45:07.970
-Please, please just come over.
-[Gladys]<i> No.</i>

45:07.972 --> 45:10.840
I-- I can't be here alone. We--
We could just sleep together.

45:10.842 --> 45:12.775
-[Gladys]<i> No.</i>
-Just next to each other.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.477
-[Gladys]<i> No.</i>
-Fully clothed if you wanted.

45:14.479 --> 45:17.046
I-- I just--
I just need you here.

45:20.018 --> 45:21.084
Hello?

45:21.086 --> 45:22.985
[wood creaks]

45:25.056 --> 45:27.156
[Gladys]<i> I'm sorry,</i>
<i> but I have to go.</i>

45:27.158 --> 45:28.591
No, no, no.

45:28.592 --> 45:30.025
-Don't go.
-[Gladys]<i> Please don't call me</i>

45:30.028 --> 45:31.094
<i> outside of office hours.</i>

45:31.096 --> 45:32.361
<i> Goodbye, Mr. Greenwood.</i>

45:32.363 --> 45:33.896
Fuck!

45:34.766 --> 45:37.266
[clanging]

45:37.268 --> 45:38.367
Oh, God.

[phone bangs twice]

45:47.779 --> 45:49.011
[pipe bangs twice]

45:49.013 --> 45:50.146
Oh, fuck.

45:51.783 --> 45:53.216
Who's doing this?

46:03.495 --> 46:06.028
Are you doing this?
Are you?

46:06.765 --> 46:08.064
You think it's funny?

46:09.167 --> 46:10.399
Well, fuck you.

46:10.401 --> 46:13.803
You're a coward,
that's all you are.

46:13.805 --> 46:17.106
A dried-up, dead,
leathery coward.

46:17.108 --> 46:18.975
I'm glad you're dead.

46:18.977 --> 46:23.913
You disappear when I was a kid,
and then you try to kill me?

46:25.984 --> 46:29.552
And now you're fucking with me
from beyond the grave?

46:29.554 --> 46:33.523
Are you? [laughs]
I wouldn't be surprised.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.263
You think I'm a cunt?

46:40.265 --> 46:44.000
[laughs]
That's hilarious.

46:45.370 --> 46:47.036
You're the cunt here.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.873
So, fuck you.
You hear me?

46:51.576 --> 46:52.842
Fuck you!

46:52.844 --> 46:54.443
Fuck you!

46:54.913 --> 46:56.012
Cunt!

47:03.922 --> 47:07.023
[sobbing]

47:28.546 --> 47:30.346
I have to tell you something.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.921
I'm afraid it's gonna make me
sound like a bad person.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.941
[Norval exhales]

[birds squawking]

49:47.652 --> 49:48.718
[chuckles]

49:49.721 --> 49:50.987
Mom.

50:09.407 --> 50:11.007
No, no, no, no.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.679
No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:28.459 --> 50:30.493
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:42.767 --> 51:46.168

52:44.295 --> 52:45.494
[man] Norval?

52:46.831 --> 52:49.265
[Norval breathes heavily]

52:54.705 --> 52:55.871
Norval.

53:00.511 --> 53:01.577
[Norval] Who are you?

53:01.579 --> 53:03.646
[Brian] You came, you came.

53:05.716 --> 53:10.186
Norval, my boy,
you actually came.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.291
Come over here.
Come, come here, help me out.

53:15.293 --> 53:17.359
[laughs]
Norval.

53:17.361 --> 53:20.829
Come on.
Get me out of here. [laughs]

53:22.600 --> 53:24.366
[man 2]
<i> Where's that fucker gone?</i>

53:25.736 --> 53:27.636
-[man] They're here.
-Who-- who-- who's here?

53:27.638 --> 53:28.871
[man] Close the fucking door.

53:28.873 --> 53:32.441
[Norval breathes heavily]

53:43.254 --> 53:44.620
Look at me.
I'm your dad.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.789
The next 90 seconds are
gonna change your life forever.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.425
They're coming to hurt me,
and you're going to kill them.

53:49.427 --> 53:51.927
-I can't.
-[Brian] You're going to hide.

53:51.929 --> 53:53.229
And when they're down here,

53:53.231 --> 53:54.597
you're going to
beat them to death.

53:54.599 --> 53:56.599
There's a dumbbell
on the floor.

53:56.601 --> 53:58.434
You take it,
and use it as a weapon,

53:58.436 --> 53:59.802
and you bash
their fuckin' brains in.

53:59.804 --> 54:01.303
What? No. No, no, no.
Please.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.671
If you don't,
they'll kill us both.

54:02.673 --> 54:04.873
-[door opens]
-Hide!

54:05.576 --> 54:08.711
[Norval panting]

54:26.631 --> 54:28.264
[man laughing]

54:35.673 --> 54:38.807
How's it hanging, Brian?
Huh?

54:38.809 --> 54:43.379
Looking good.
Feeling good, huh?

54:45.883 --> 54:46.949
[chuckles]

54:47.852 --> 54:49.451
Viddy this.

54:52.390 --> 54:53.589
This, Brian...

54:58.829 --> 55:02.364
this is a pen.

55:02.366 --> 55:07.936
Not just any pen,
it's a pen smeared in extrement.

55:10.875 --> 55:13.042
My extrement.
[laughs]

55:13.044 --> 55:15.678
Extrement is the scientific word
for poo.

55:15.680 --> 55:18.981
It's excrement, not extrement.

55:18.983 --> 55:20.749
I'm gonna stab you
with this pen, Brian.

55:20.751 --> 55:23.485
And obviously
it's going to hurt.

55:24.588 --> 55:26.388
But then the science kicks in.

55:26.390 --> 55:30.526
So, the extrement
that's on the pen

55:30.528 --> 55:33.395
is gonna go into your wound
and it's gonna give you

55:33.397 --> 55:35.798
an infection
that's gonna kill you

55:35.800 --> 55:38.734
if you don't get help quickly.

55:40.805 --> 55:43.505
How's that
for a ticking clock, Brian?

55:43.507 --> 55:45.507
[laughs]

55:45.509 --> 55:47.109
How's that
for excitement, Brian?

55:47.111 --> 55:50.412
Are you excited?
Because I'm excited, Brian.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.049
Now...

55:56.053 --> 55:59.421
why don't you tell me
what I want to know...

55:59.423 --> 56:03.625
And when this is all over,
I'll get you to a hospital.

56:03.627 --> 56:05.361
I already told
Gordon everything.

56:05.363 --> 56:07.363
It's gone. All of it.

56:11.902 --> 56:13.969
[chuckles]

56:15.573 --> 56:18.507
Shall I tell you
how I know you're lying?

56:18.509 --> 56:19.575
[Brian] How?

56:19.577 --> 56:24.046
Because when you said that,
you looked up to your left.

56:24.048 --> 56:26.648
-Oh.
-And that's the number one

56:26.650 --> 56:28.784
indication when somebody's
lying to you.

56:29.453 --> 56:31.854
[laughs]

56:31.856 --> 56:33.889
Yeah, I know these things

56:33.891 --> 56:36.425
because I've read articles
on body language.

56:37.027 --> 56:38.093
All right?

56:39.029 --> 56:40.796
This is difficult for me too.

56:42.900 --> 56:45.667
So what do you say we just
get this over and done with

56:45.669 --> 56:47.536
as quickly as possible,
shall we?

56:47.538 --> 56:48.570
No, no, no.

56:48.572 --> 56:49.938
-[man] Shall we?
-No.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.440
Here it comes.
Are you ready?

56:51.441 --> 56:52.941
-[Brian] No, no. Come on.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

56:52.943 --> 56:55.611
-No, no, no, no.
-[Brian groans]

56:55.613 --> 56:57.780
God damn it!
[groans]

56:57.782 --> 56:59.815
It stings.
The first one stings,

56:59.817 --> 57:01.083
-doesn't it?
-[groans]

57:01.085 --> 57:02.618
Mind you,
so does the second one.

57:02.620 --> 57:03.819
Fuck! Now!
Fuckin' kill him!

57:03.821 --> 57:05.988
-Fucking kill him!
-[Jethro] What?

57:06.857 --> 57:09.158
[Norval panting]

57:09.160 --> 57:11.727
-Are we not alone, Brian?
-[Brian] Come on! Do it!

57:22.473 --> 57:24.773
[man] Come out, come out.
Wherever you are.

57:26.544 --> 57:27.843
How the fuck
are you still alive?

57:27.845 --> 57:29.611
[grunting]

57:29.613 --> 57:31.613
[Brian] Fucking kill him!

57:40.724 --> 57:42.024
Fuck this shit.

57:45.463 --> 57:46.862
[door closing]

57:48.999 --> 57:50.732
You were supposed to kill him.

58:03.514 --> 58:06.682
[man]<i> Gordon! Oh, no!</i>

58:06.684 --> 58:09.651
<i> -No, no, no! Gordon!</i>
-[banging]

58:09.653 --> 58:12.154
What happened to the man
who was up there?

58:13.924 --> 58:17.192
He tried to stab me.
But then he had a heart attack.

58:17.761 --> 58:18.827
He died.

58:19.763 --> 58:21.263
[footsteps]

58:21.765 --> 58:22.831
Good.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.533
[door opens]

58:24.535 --> 58:25.667
[man] I'll be back.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.970
And I'll be back
with a little friend

58:27.972 --> 58:30.606
that I want you both to meet!

58:30.608 --> 58:31.773
[door slams]

58:31.775 --> 58:35.143
My guess is his little friend
is Dandy.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.179
Who's Dandy?

58:37.181 --> 58:39.748
-The hunchback.
-The what?

58:39.750 --> 58:41.850
You have to release me.
You ever picked a lock before?

58:41.852 --> 58:43.619
Once, in school.

58:43.621 --> 58:44.686
[Brian] What happened?

58:44.688 --> 58:46.655
I didn't get it unlocked.

58:46.657 --> 58:49.892
But I-- I found the key
in my bag, so it was okay.

58:52.162 --> 58:56.131
Oh. Uh, smash the shitty pen.

58:59.870 --> 59:00.869
Go on.

59:03.274 --> 59:05.157
[grunts]

59:05.158 --> 59:07.041
[Brian] Yeah.
Now, take that long thin bit.

59:11.649 --> 59:13.749
[Norval] God.
[exhales]

59:16.120 --> 59:19.688
[Brian] Now...
Now, jam it into the lock.

59:19.690 --> 59:22.024
Work it in small circles.

59:23.193 --> 59:24.693
Who was that man?

59:24.695 --> 59:26.762
His name is Jethro.
He's my best friend.

59:28.699 --> 59:30.699
Then why is he stabbing you
with poo pens

59:30.701 --> 59:32.334
and chaining you up
in your basement?

59:32.336 --> 59:34.202
He has his reasons.

59:34.204 --> 59:40.108
After I left your mom,
I ended up living in Bangkok.

59:40.110 --> 59:45.647
Me, Jethro, Gordon,
who you've met, and Dandy.

59:45.649 --> 59:48.116
We were misbehaving
in a small-time fashion.

59:48.118 --> 59:51.320
Until we decided to do
one last score.

59:51.322 --> 59:54.823
Sail off into the sunset,
all that.

59:56.627 --> 59:57.759
What did you do?

59:57.761 --> 1:00:00.295
Oh, we kidnapped

1:00:00.297 --> 1:00:02.664
the daughter of Thailand's
richest man.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:08.203
We were supposed to split
the ransom between us,

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:09.738
but I stole it.

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:12.941
I ripped my best friends off.

1:00:12.943 --> 1:00:15.844
Understandably,
they want their share.

1:00:15.846 --> 1:00:18.213
They think I have stashed it
somewhere.

1:00:18.215 --> 1:00:21.917
Fact is, it's all gone.

1:00:23.287 --> 1:00:24.853
Every last cent.

1:00:26.090 --> 1:00:27.155
Where?

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:33.095
You ever stop for a moment
and wonder why

1:00:33.097 --> 1:00:35.931
you grew up
in a Beverly Hills mansion

1:00:35.933 --> 1:00:37.332
with an unemployed mother?

1:00:42.906 --> 1:00:45.307
My entire life
has been funded by--

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:46.642
A kidnapping.

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:48.243
[chuckles]

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:54.116
Sorry to change the subject,
but this isn't working.

1:00:54.118 --> 1:00:57.019
You're going to have
to dislocate my thumb,

1:00:57.021 --> 1:00:58.053
I'm afraid.

1:00:59.323 --> 1:01:01.657
What?

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:03.992
You take my thumb and you
bend it all the way back.

1:01:03.994 --> 1:01:06.895
Quickly, come on.

1:01:06.897 --> 1:01:09.898
On the--
The count of three, okay?

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:12.434
All right.

1:01:14.004 --> 1:01:19.074
One, two, three.
[groans]

1:01:21.178 --> 1:01:22.444
Just fucking do it.

1:01:22.446 --> 1:01:24.379
-[bone cracking]
-[groans]

1:01:24.381 --> 1:01:26.014
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:01:26.383 --> 1:01:28.750
[groans]

1:01:28.752 --> 1:01:30.352
Did that work?

1:01:30.354 --> 1:01:33.855
Oh, God, Jesus.
[laughs]

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:36.792
Okay. Let's see
what we can do here.

1:01:37.094 --> 1:01:38.427
[grunts]

1:01:40.964 --> 1:01:43.732
Right.
[breathes heavily]

1:01:43.734 --> 1:01:45.033
Thumb wasn't enough.

1:01:45.035 --> 1:01:46.902
You're gonna have to try
the index finger.

1:01:46.904 --> 1:01:48.537
What?

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:50.171
-[Brian] Come on.
-No. I-- I can't. Please.

1:01:50.174 --> 1:01:54.076
I abandoned you as a child.
Consider this your revenge.

1:01:55.779 --> 1:01:58.447
Channel all that anger.
Come on.

1:02:01.251 --> 1:02:02.984
-[bones cracking]
-[groaning]

1:02:02.986 --> 1:02:04.052
Oh, fuck!

1:02:04.855 --> 1:02:07.989
Ooh, hoo, oh, hoo, baby.

1:02:07.991 --> 1:02:10.258
Oh, God.
[grunts]

1:02:15.032 --> 1:02:16.098
Fuck.

1:02:45.963 --> 1:02:49.765
[chains rattling]

1:02:53.437 --> 1:02:54.903
You're gonna have to carry me.

1:02:54.905 --> 1:02:56.338
We have to get as far away

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:57.873
from this fuckin' house
as possible.

1:02:57.875 --> 1:02:59.174
I'm not made for this.

1:02:59.176 --> 1:03:01.343
You want to be tortured
to death by a hunchback?

1:03:05.783 --> 1:03:07.983
[both grunting]

1:03:09.319 --> 1:03:11.386
[Brian] Wait! Wait!
Put-- put-- put-- put-- put--

1:03:11.388 --> 1:03:14.356
Put me down. Put me down.
Whoa, whoa.

1:03:14.358 --> 1:03:16.992
I need some water.
Get me some water, will you?

1:03:16.994 --> 1:03:18.994
-Okay.
-[Brian] Okay, hurry up.

1:03:22.866 --> 1:03:24.533
[water running]

1:03:30.374 --> 1:03:31.439
You're missing an ear.

1:03:31.441 --> 1:03:33.008
-You know that?
-[Brian] Mm-hmm.

1:03:33.010 --> 1:03:35.010
Gordon kicked it off.

1:03:35.012 --> 1:03:38.079
Well, shall we go find it?
They-- they can sew it back on.

1:03:38.081 --> 1:03:40.182
Not gonna be possible,
I'm afraid.

1:03:40.184 --> 1:03:41.316
[Norval] Why not?

1:03:41.318 --> 1:03:42.984
It's just not, okay?

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:44.553
Why?

1:03:47.491 --> 1:03:48.890
I ate it.

1:03:48.892 --> 1:03:51.293
You-- you--
You ate your own ear?

1:03:51.295 --> 1:03:53.629
[Brian] He made me.

1:03:53.630 --> 1:03:55.964
He gave me a choice between
my own ear or a shot-glass

1:03:55.966 --> 1:03:58.233
of his semen...
like some kind of

1:03:58.235 --> 1:04:00.101
Japanese game show
or something.

1:04:00.103 --> 1:04:01.436
And I chose the ear.

1:04:04.374 --> 1:04:05.907
He was starving me!

1:04:06.443 --> 1:04:07.943
Um, but semen contains

1:04:07.945 --> 1:04:09.477
more protein
and nutrients than an ear.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:11.179
-Ears are just cartilage.
-Look!

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:13.315
The semen was yellow, okay?

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:15.383
I'm not defending
my choice to you.

1:04:15.385 --> 1:04:17.052
Let's fucking go!

1:04:19.089 --> 1:04:20.622
Can I go to the toilet?

1:04:21.992 --> 1:04:23.225
Number one or number two?

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:25.327
-[Norval] One.
-Be really fucking quick.

1:04:27.531 --> 1:04:34.502
¶<i> You really showed me</i>
<i> how to play the game</i> ¶

1:04:36.273 --> 1:04:38.039
-Sh--
-[grunting]

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:39.174
[Brian] Dandy!

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:43.111
Dandy!
Don't you touch my son!

1:04:43.113 --> 1:04:45.146
Don't you fucking touch him!

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:50.886
Norval!

1:04:52.322 --> 1:04:53.922
[grunting]

1:05:03.066 --> 1:05:04.466
Come on, Norval!

1:05:05.669 --> 1:05:08.570
[glass shatters]

1:05:08.572 --> 1:05:11.606
[grunting]

1:05:15.479 --> 1:05:16.978
It's you or him!

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:23.551
Do what you have to do, son.

1:05:25.689 --> 1:05:28.957
[grunting]

1:05:33.063 --> 1:05:34.663
[panting]

1:05:34.665 --> 1:05:37.399
Kill the fucker! Kill him!

1:05:39.169 --> 1:05:43.305
[grunting]

1:05:48.946 --> 1:05:51.680
[screams]

1:05:53.450 --> 1:05:56.151
[Dandy gasping]

1:06:03.093 --> 1:06:07.028
[grunting]

1:06:14.571 --> 1:06:18.073
[panting]

1:06:22.579 --> 1:06:23.645
[Brian] Son.

1:06:26.616 --> 1:06:28.016
Are you okay?

1:06:32.556 --> 1:06:33.655
Norval?

1:06:37.361 --> 1:06:39.461
Please tell me you're okay.

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:42.464
[music playing]

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:45.467
[water running]

1:06:48.038 --> 1:06:51.172
[music playing]

1:07:07.424 --> 1:07:10.091
[chuckles]

1:07:14.598 --> 1:07:16.564
[groans]

1:07:21.038 --> 1:07:22.237
Hey.

1:07:26.676 --> 1:07:28.376
What happened in there,
you know...

1:07:29.179 --> 1:07:30.378
it's-- it's...

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:32.781
It's always...

1:07:34.284 --> 1:07:35.383
I mean...

1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:38.620
What I'm saying is it's...

1:07:43.193 --> 1:07:44.626
Come on.
We've got to go.

1:07:44.628 --> 1:07:46.261
We've got to go!

1:07:48.265 --> 1:07:51.533
[grunting]

1:07:56.106 --> 1:07:57.806
-[Norval] Who was Ryan?
-[Brian] Huh?

1:07:57.808 --> 1:08:03.178
[Norval] Gordon had a tattoo
on his neck. [grunts]

1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:04.446
"R.I.P Ryan".

1:08:04.448 --> 1:08:05.680
Oh, Ryan.

1:08:05.682 --> 1:08:07.682
That was Gordon's son.

1:08:07.684 --> 1:08:10.552
Slashed his wrists in the bath.

1:08:10.554 --> 1:08:13.655
Sad story.
He was a decent kid.

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:17.559
[car approaching]

1:08:17.561 --> 1:08:18.626
Hide!

1:08:18.628 --> 1:08:23.298
[car engine revving]

1:08:33.110 --> 1:08:34.642
[door closing]

1:08:51.495 --> 1:08:54.262
My little friend
can't wait to meet you,

1:08:54.264 --> 1:08:56.731
you fuckin' wank-stains!

1:08:58.401 --> 1:08:59.467
[Brian] Shit.

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:03.304
We have to get the fuck away
from here.

1:09:04.774 --> 1:09:07.675
Wait! Dad, wait!
I just realized something.

1:09:07.677 --> 1:09:09.544
-[Brian] What?
-[Norval] Me and mom's address

1:09:09.546 --> 1:09:11.212
is written on my luggage tag.

1:09:11.214 --> 1:09:14.282
-If he finds it...
-[Brian] Fuck.

1:09:14.918 --> 1:09:16.351
What do we do?

1:09:18.288 --> 1:09:19.420
[Brian] Fuck!

1:09:24.895 --> 1:09:26.394
You're gonna have to kill him.

1:09:27.898 --> 1:09:29.397
I'm not a murderer.

1:09:29.399 --> 1:09:32.500
You just killed somebody
literally five minutes ago.

1:09:32.502 --> 1:09:34.736
I'd gladly kill
the fucker myself,

1:09:34.738 --> 1:09:35.937
but look at me.

1:09:39.176 --> 1:09:41.176
If you don't go in there
and kill him,

1:09:41.178 --> 1:09:43.845
we'll never be safe.
You're part of this now.

1:09:43.847 --> 1:09:45.380
So is your mother.

1:09:47.450 --> 1:09:50.251
He has a flaming crossbow.
I have nothing.

1:09:50.253 --> 1:09:51.886
I wouldn't last a second.

1:10:01.464 --> 1:10:03.331
[Brian] You hide in the trunk
of his car.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:06.401
You follow him everywhere.
And then when he's alone,

1:10:06.403 --> 1:10:08.503
when he's vulnerable--

1:10:08.505 --> 1:10:09.637
[Jethro]<i> Dandy!</i>

1:10:10.507 --> 1:10:11.739
<i> Not Dandy!</i>

1:10:12.576 --> 1:10:14.676
<i>You fuckin' killed Dandy too.</i>

1:10:15.478 --> 1:10:16.611
[Brian] Go!

1:10:27.891 --> 1:10:30.959
[Norval panting]

1:10:42.572 --> 1:10:44.806
[Jethro] This is an important
announcement

1:10:44.808 --> 1:10:46.841
for Norval Greenwood

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:51.679
of 91622 West Linden Drive,

1:10:51.681 --> 1:10:54.549
Beverly Hills, California!

1:10:54.551 --> 1:10:57.685
You and the rest
of the Greenwood family

1:10:57.687 --> 1:11:00.255
are now officially fucked!

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:02.857
It's official!

1:11:19.442 --> 1:11:22.944
[Norval panting]

1:11:22.946 --> 1:11:25.580
[car engine starts]

1:11:32.555 --> 1:11:34.722
[Jethro] Precious?
Yeah, yeah.

1:11:34.724 --> 1:11:36.858
My name's Jethro.
I'm a mate of Dandy's.

1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:39.560
Yeah. I was the guy sitting
in the corner watching.

1:11:39.562 --> 1:11:40.561
Yeah.

1:11:40.563 --> 1:11:42.163
Look, listen.

1:11:42.164 --> 1:11:43.764
Could you meet me at the hotel
for a session?

1:11:43.767 --> 1:11:46.367
Like, I'm really stressed.
Please.

1:11:46.369 --> 1:11:47.702
As soon as you can.

1:11:48.905 --> 1:11:50.438
Oh, you're an angel.

1:12:05.555 --> 1:12:07.789
[Norval panting]

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:12.060
[rain pouring]

1:12:12.062 --> 1:12:13.795

1:12:55.605 --> 1:12:56.771
[crossbow fires]

1:12:56.773 --> 1:12:57.839
Fuck.

1:13:03.747 --> 1:13:04.846
Shit.

1:13:04.848 --> 1:13:07.115
[vehicle approaching]

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:17.759
[thunder rumbling]

1:13:27.103 --> 1:13:28.136
Hi.

1:13:32.008 --> 1:13:34.075
-Are you a prostitute?
-Excuse me?

1:13:34.077 --> 1:13:35.977
Whatever he pays,
I'll triple it.

1:13:35.979 --> 1:13:37.979
All you have to do
is leave the door open

1:13:37.981 --> 1:13:39.147
a little when you leave.

1:13:39.149 --> 1:13:41.616
-[scoffs]
-Listen, Precious...

1:13:41.618 --> 1:13:43.751
How in the fuck do you know
my name?

1:13:43.753 --> 1:13:46.988
Get the fuck out of here
before I tear your nuts off.

1:13:52.796 --> 1:13:54.061
-[clears throat]
-[knocks on door]

1:13:54.063 --> 1:13:55.763
[Norval] Oh, shit.

1:14:01.104 --> 1:14:03.538
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.039
Oh. Okay.

1:14:05.041 --> 1:14:07.208
How can I help you, sir?

1:14:07.210 --> 1:14:09.644
Uh, I'd like to rent a room,
please.

1:14:09.646 --> 1:14:11.979
Ah, no, no, no, no.
The whole motel is booked out,

1:14:11.981 --> 1:14:14.482
what with the geology
conference in town.

1:14:14.484 --> 1:14:16.951
-Geology conference?
-[man] Yeah.

1:14:16.953 --> 1:14:19.187
It's really a swinger's
convention.

1:14:19.189 --> 1:14:21.589
I shit you not.
I have a whole motel full

1:14:21.591 --> 1:14:25.560
of flabby sex people,
just doing whatever they do.

1:14:25.562 --> 1:14:28.129
But, um, we do have
one family unit available,

1:14:28.131 --> 1:14:29.997
but it's, uh, further down
the road.

1:14:31.201 --> 1:14:33.468
-I'd prefer a room here.
-[Danny] Yeah.

1:14:33.470 --> 1:14:34.969
I bet you would prefer
a room here.

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:37.472
But as I already said,
there are geologists

1:14:37.474 --> 1:14:39.140
in every room of the motel,
bar none.

1:14:39.142 --> 1:14:41.509
The one that is available
is a family unit

1:14:41.511 --> 1:14:43.194
some distance away.

1:14:43.195 --> 1:14:44.878
Now, would you like to rent
said family unit?

1:14:44.881 --> 1:14:47.148
Or do you want to keep
doing what we're doing here?

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:51.085
-Maybe later.
-Okay, maybe later.

1:14:51.654 --> 1:14:52.720
Bye now.

1:14:53.957 --> 1:14:55.790
[sighs]

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:58.693
[thunder rumbling]

1:15:10.773 --> 1:15:12.673
-[door closes]
-Hey.

1:15:14.911 --> 1:15:15.977
Yes?

1:15:15.979 --> 1:15:20.915
I thought I might let you know
there's a suspicious woman

1:15:20.917 --> 1:15:22.717
lingering by a car out there.

1:15:23.887 --> 1:15:25.553
A suspicious woman?

1:15:25.555 --> 1:15:29.023
Trust me. Yeah.
She's legit.

1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.795
Okay. So, you're clearly
some kind of sex freak.

1:15:34.797 --> 1:15:38.032
But I am intrigued,
I'm not gonna lie.

1:15:38.034 --> 1:15:41.602
I'm serious.
Incredible body.

1:15:42.238 --> 1:15:43.804
All right.
Full disclosure,

1:15:43.806 --> 1:15:45.606
I'm gonna put all my cards
on the table.

1:15:45.608 --> 1:15:48.676
I'm what's known in medical
circles as a titty-holic.

1:15:48.678 --> 1:15:49.610
All right?

1:15:49.612 --> 1:15:52.079
So, naturally my next question
to you is does she, like--

1:15:52.081 --> 1:15:54.315
Let me stop you right there,
and say that if this woman

1:15:56.018 --> 1:15:57.718
she'd be found in the area
designated Double D.

1:16:01.991 --> 1:16:04.825
Okay, well,
sir, I will just be right back.

1:16:04.827 --> 1:16:06.928
Give me a minute,
I'll go and investigate.

1:16:06.930 --> 1:16:08.763

1:16:51.274 --> 1:16:53.975
[Precious] Huh?
How do you like that shit,

1:16:53.977 --> 1:16:56.177
you limp-dicked fuckface?

1:16:56.179 --> 1:16:58.613
[Jethro] Really get
aggressive now. Really pull.

1:16:58.615 --> 1:17:01.115

[Norval grunting] Come on.

1:19:32.969 --> 1:19:34.869
[Precious]
Oh. So, you like that, huh?

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:38.339
What did I say?

1:19:38.341 --> 1:19:41.442
This is private business.
Now, fuck off!

1:19:41.444 --> 1:19:45.179
Uh, listen, Precious,
my fight isn't with you.

1:19:45.181 --> 1:19:46.480
Agree to disagree.

1:19:46.482 --> 1:19:48.315
[grunting]

1:19:57.927 --> 1:19:59.426
Hold him tight for me, Precious.

1:19:59.428 --> 1:20:01.495
[Norval groans]

1:20:02.899 --> 1:20:07.868
Now, you are going to die here.

1:20:10.873 --> 1:20:12.540
And I'm going to L.A.

1:20:12.542 --> 1:20:15.876
So, do have any little message
for your mommy?

1:20:16.379 --> 1:20:17.912
Tell her I love her.

1:20:17.914 --> 1:20:20.514
[Jethro laughs]
I'm gonna specifically tell her

1:20:20.516 --> 1:20:22.283
that you don't love her.

1:20:23.085 --> 1:20:24.451
[grunting]
Bastard!

1:20:24.453 --> 1:20:26.420

[laughs]

1:20:47.009 --> 1:20:48.075
Oh, bugger.

1:20:48.077 --> 1:20:50.211
That was supposed to go
in your ear.

1:20:50.213 --> 1:20:53.047
-Sorry about that.
-[Precious] Oh!

1:20:53.049 --> 1:20:55.449
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Ah, shit.

1:20:58.921 --> 1:21:00.988
Hey. No, no, no, no.

1:21:01.924 --> 1:21:03.057
Hey!

1:21:03.926 --> 1:21:05.359
I think you killed him.

1:21:06.596 --> 1:21:08.896
You killed him,
you big tonk twat.

1:21:08.898 --> 1:21:10.998
You just fuckin' squeezed
the life clean out of him.

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.099
I watched you.

Do you know something?

1:21:20.042 --> 1:21:23.577
Sod this fuckin'
sad-sack situation.

1:21:23.579 --> 1:21:25.379
I'm out of here like Vladimir.

1:21:27.016 --> 1:21:29.316
You are a cold-blooded
psychopath.

1:21:30.553 --> 1:21:32.086
I'm a psychopath?

1:21:32.088 --> 1:21:36.290
You're a muscle-bound prozzie
who gets lonely men

1:21:36.292 --> 1:21:38.525
into headlocks for cash!

1:21:38.527 --> 1:21:40.527
And let me tell you
something else, sweetheart,

1:21:40.529 --> 1:21:42.663
there's been this invention
called deodorant.

1:21:42.665 --> 1:21:45.332
You should try it sometime.
All right?

1:21:47.303 --> 1:21:48.369
Jesus!

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.286
Yeah.

1:22:42.692 --> 1:22:44.491
[Precious] I'm, like,
an accessory to murder.

1:22:44.493 --> 1:22:47.294
This is... Oh, shit.

1:22:49.131 --> 1:22:52.266
This is, like, oh--
It's, like, a life sentence.

1:22:52.268 --> 1:22:53.534
[labored breath]

1:22:58.507 --> 1:22:59.573
Hi.

[car engine revving]

[Norval groaning]

1:24:57.460 --> 1:24:59.526
[Jethro] Listen very carefully,
Norval.

1:25:00.362 --> 1:25:02.162
This is very important.

1:25:03.332 --> 1:25:05.632
So, it's vital
that you listen carefully.

1:25:06.168 --> 1:25:07.401
Right?

1:25:08.304 --> 1:25:10.137
Your mother is a prostitute.

1:25:10.139 --> 1:25:15.442
That's how your father met her.
He was a frequent flier.

1:25:18.147 --> 1:25:20.481
You think her name
is Jacqueline.

1:25:20.483 --> 1:25:23.117
But her real name is Annie.

1:25:23.786 --> 1:25:25.185
I fucked her.

1:25:25.187 --> 1:25:29.156
I fucked her in an abandoned
factory to be precise.

1:25:30.359 --> 1:25:32.159
But I lost my erection.

1:25:33.295 --> 1:25:35.162
Because from certain angles,

1:25:35.164 --> 1:25:37.664
she reminded me
of Michael Heseltine.

1:25:40.669 --> 1:25:42.269
Michael Heseltine...

1:25:43.539 --> 1:25:44.671
if you're wondering...

1:25:46.575 --> 1:25:49.843
is a British politician
from the 1980s.

1:27:04.853 --> 1:27:06.753

1:28:30.939 --> 1:28:32.873
I have to tell you something.

1:28:37.046 --> 1:28:39.313
But I'm afraid
it makes me sound

1:28:39.315 --> 1:28:40.580
like a bad person.

1:28:47.589 --> 1:28:49.923
[panting]

1:28:54.997 --> 1:28:57.631
I never let Mom get over you.

1:29:08.877 --> 1:29:10.944
Every man that came along,

1:29:12.081 --> 1:29:13.814
I drove them away.

1:29:20.756 --> 1:29:25.392
She had so many chances
to be happy.

1:29:29.631 --> 1:29:31.431
And I never let her.

1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:40.107
I always thought
you'd come back.

1:29:43.045 --> 1:29:45.645
And then we'd pick up
where we left off.

1:29:56.392 --> 1:29:58.125
Why did you write to me?

1:30:09.405 --> 1:30:10.504
Dad?

1:30:13.609 --> 1:30:15.709
Why-- why did you write to me?
