02:06.760 --> 02:10.116
That's a new world record,
by Misha Averin!

02:10.360 --> 02:11.817
Mum, Mum!

02:12.080 --> 02:13.640
I've done 57 seconds!

02:13.801 --> 02:14.757
Nice.

02:35.844 --> 02:36.720
Bedtime.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.199
No bed.

02:38.564 --> 02:40.124
Misha!

02:47.166 --> 02:48.803
Misha, it's not funny.

02:49.366 --> 02:50.561
You're in bed.

02:52.326 --> 02:53.919
I've got him!

02:54.207 --> 02:55.448
No bed.

02:55.565 --> 02:57.222
No bed, no bed.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.307
No bed.

02:58.604 --> 02:59.604
No.

03:03.887 --> 03:05.686
Come here, couch, couch!

03:13.856 --> 03:14.854
Okay,

03:14.889 --> 03:16.209
I'm done with it.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.082
Give mommy a kiss.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.570
She's tired.

03:28.571 --> 03:29.641
Go to bed!

03:55.374 --> 03:56.330
Morning.

04:05.856 --> 04:09.884
- This is all I got
- Thank you Sergei. We all appreciate it.

04:11.937 --> 04:13.416
Slowly!

04:15.097 --> 04:16.245
That's it.

04:16.976 --> 04:21.176
Sorry gentlemen, we have received
nothing from Moscow.

04:22.978 --> 04:24.936
So what are we
supposed to live on?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.658
If I knew that,
I would be living on it too.

04:28.757 --> 04:31.748
At least you have a deployment coming,
you will get a sea bonus.

04:31.861 --> 04:33.500
Which will not be paid.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.060
Pavel!

04:43.261 --> 04:45.172
We have to go, come up!

04:45.901 --> 04:47.892
Sergei gave us 800.

04:48.381 --> 04:50.612
- She added more.
- She what?

04:50.782 --> 04:52.580
She added more?

04:55.823 --> 04:58.736
She said everything on the list,
or she'd kill me.

04:59.482 --> 05:02.259
Ahh.. another 4 cases of vodka,

05:02.463 --> 05:03.976
5 more cases of beer,

05:04.143 --> 05:06.494
18 rolls of crepe, balloons,

05:06.557 --> 05:07.308
champagne!

05:07.789 --> 05:08.904
Shit!

05:09.704 --> 05:10.978
Then cancel it.

05:13.224 --> 05:15.057
Or marry me, instead.

05:15.265 --> 05:16.460
Who's got our money?

05:16.625 --> 05:17.376
What?

05:17.546 --> 05:19.263
- Who's got our money?
- Anton!

05:24.866 --> 05:27.016
It's not enough, it's not even close.

05:27.547 --> 05:28.867
We'll be fine.

05:29.147 --> 05:30.137
Oleg!

05:32.428 --> 05:34.544
- I would marry her.
- Shut up!

05:38.347 --> 05:40.579
- I would be the ideal wife.
- Shut up, Oleg!

05:40.788 --> 05:41.937
Give me the list.

05:46.169 --> 05:48.148
Well, this is what we need.

05:48.869 --> 05:51.145
This is the money, it's a bit short.

05:53.072 --> 05:53.863
Forget it.

05:54.176 --> 05:56.317
- I'll pay the balance next week
- yeah I'm sure you will

05:56.353 --> 05:58.453
or the week after the latest,
I promise.

05:58.489 --> 05:59.315
Cash and carry.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.497
C'mon, it-it's my
best friend's wedding.

06:02.511 --> 06:03.785
I think we're done here.

06:03.951 --> 06:05.066
Are you serious?

06:05.472 --> 06:07.030
Yeah I'm dead serious.

06:08.032 --> 06:09.262
I don't believe this.

06:16.050 --> 06:17.038
- Hey!
- Huh?

06:17.237 --> 06:19.190
- Hey!
- No, no no no Mikhail.

06:19.753 --> 06:21.073
You see this?

06:22.354 --> 06:23.925
What about this?

06:25.754 --> 06:27.587
It's a mariner's watch.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.108
Anything else you need?

06:30.275 --> 06:32.107
Shoes? Jackets?

06:33.115 --> 06:34.515
Underwear?

06:38.836 --> 06:39.792
That's great.

06:41.876 --> 06:42.946
Looks good.

06:43.677 --> 06:44.837
That will make her happy.

07:44.045 --> 07:45.842
Can we have some vodka please?

07:47.125 --> 07:49.480
This is, this is my watch
we're drinking out of..

07:50.086 --> 07:52.645
Can we uh.. start the dinner now
or wait a little bit?

07:54.006 --> 07:55.519
What happened to your watch?

07:55.686 --> 07:57.438
No no no don't worry,
it's a long story.

07:57.606 --> 07:59.483
Uh, we are all a bit naked.

08:00.007 --> 08:02.078
- What happened then?
- We sold the watch.

08:02.247 --> 08:04.397
You didn't, you sold them why?

08:04.567 --> 08:07.400
Well because of.. because of this,

08:07.467 --> 08:09.602
and this, and this, and this,

08:09.808 --> 08:11.367
and everything!

08:11.528 --> 08:13.246
- Seriously?
- We bought it.

08:15.568 --> 08:17.207
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.970
- Oleg what's happening?
- Are you crying?

08:20.810 --> 08:22.686
Look at him, he's cry.. ha-ha...

08:23.050 --> 08:24.608
- He's crying.
- I'm not crying.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.364
- What's the matter with you?
- Why are you crying?

08:28.450 --> 08:30.681
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yes let's go. Oleg!

08:30.851 --> 08:32.808
Stop crying, you'll make me cry.

08:37.732 --> 08:38.961
Oleg, stop it.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.361
Are you enjoying yourselves?

08:41.412 --> 08:43.005
Just for my wife, one.

08:43.381 --> 08:46.229
I have no idea maybe... it's the
very barrenness of this place

08:46.265 --> 08:47.636
that brings us together.

08:48.298 --> 08:50.960
But there is no denying,
that we are one.

08:51.969 --> 08:55.144
And tonight,
Pavel and Daria are one.

08:57.534 --> 08:59.491
And as Pavel's best friend...

08:59.655 --> 09:01.155
Oh, look who's crying now?

09:01.215 --> 09:02.155
Shut up!

09:03.855 --> 09:05.155
Me? What did I do?

09:06.576 --> 09:10.570
As Pavel's best friend,
let me propose a toast.

09:11.136 --> 09:15.687
To Pavel and Daria, and the half
dozen children they will have,

09:15.707 --> 09:19.056
that will take care of me,
their uncle Anton, in my old age.

09:27.499 --> 09:31.173
And I would love to offer,
a toast to Daria.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.531
As my.. lovely Tania can attest,

09:36.179 --> 09:40.014
life.. as a Navy wife is not easy.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.249
Life here at the Northern Fleet

09:43.701 --> 09:45.213
is even harder.

09:45.761 --> 09:49.532
And then imagine being Pavel's wife..

09:50.301 --> 09:51.622
On top of that.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.293
Imagine the agony!

09:57.582 --> 09:59.300
But we make do.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.733
And when things get at their worst,

10:03.783 --> 10:05.377
what do we do?

10:05.663 --> 10:09.658
The sailor's man, the sailor's man,

10:09.824 --> 10:13.613
Here's my heart and here's my hand.

10:13.864 --> 10:17.158
The sailor's man, the sailor's man,

10:17.325 --> 10:20.614
Here's my heart and here's my hand.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.184
I think I think,

10:22.326 --> 10:23.865
I think I think,

10:24.025 --> 10:27.417
It's time to have, another drink,

10:27.866 --> 10:30.717
The sailor's man, the sailor's man,

10:30.766 --> 10:34.216
Here's my heart and here's my hand.

10:34.507 --> 10:36.260
A kiss!

10:48.549 --> 10:49.869
One, two,

10:50.150 --> 10:54.107
three, four, five, six,

10:54.270 --> 10:59.908
seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve,

11:00.071 --> 11:03.909
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

11:04.271 --> 11:08.410
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty.

11:09.232 --> 11:12.427
Twenty! Yeah! ha-ha..

11:40.795 --> 11:42.514
- You're my best friend.
- I know.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.509
Ten years, ten years of luck!

11:48.677 --> 11:50.556
What, why ten?

12:11.640 --> 12:12.835
Come.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.234
What are you doing?

12:22.441 --> 12:24.398
Do you want to go next?

12:31.322 --> 12:32.471
Stopped.

12:34.683 --> 12:35.878
Can you feel him?

12:36.603 --> 12:37.513
Yes.

12:41.124 --> 12:42.922
Sleep well my love.

12:44.484 --> 12:46.395
Sleep well my brother.

13:14.768 --> 13:16.281
Morning, sir.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.159
Morning.

13:20.249 --> 13:22.682
- Hey, ready to go fishing?
- How are you?

13:39.049 --> 13:41.120
Sir, what are you
gonna play on the TV?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.240
We're gonna play
some very serious shit.

13:45.819 --> 13:47.048
Wait wait wait.

13:47.332 --> 13:48.288
Slowly.

13:49.172 --> 13:51.005
- I got it!
- We did it.

13:52.093 --> 13:54.289
- Have they started it?
- I dunno.

13:56.894 --> 13:59.409
Alexei. What's going on?

13:59.614 --> 14:01.890
- You have to get back into shape...
- Uh, shut up.

14:18.777 --> 14:20.848
- Alexei, how are you doing?
- Great.

14:21.017 --> 14:23.294
Right there, in Moscow.

14:24.418 --> 14:26.568
No no no, look.

14:26.738 --> 14:29.691
- No, leave the music, leave the music.
- Leave the music.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.257
Pavel!

14:53.701 --> 14:56.455
Still married, after 24 hours?

14:56.662 --> 14:57.652
So far, so good.

14:57.822 --> 14:59.779
You're lucky she's so tolerant.

15:00.063 --> 15:03.103
- So, this is the Fat Girl?
- Yeah.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.618
It's sweating.

15:05.343 --> 15:06.742
Is it angry?

15:06.903 --> 15:09.895
130 degrees. Within parameters.

15:10.264 --> 15:12.414
Not angry, but irritated.

15:13.424 --> 15:15.893
Reactor to three-quarter power state.

15:16.065 --> 15:17.816
Temperature and pressure normal.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.398
Port and starboard CGs online.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.897
Main engines ready.

15:31.506 --> 15:33.020
Propulsion crew online.

15:33.187 --> 15:34.985
Precee and harbour station checks.

15:35.147 --> 15:36.660
Complete and reported to manoeuvres.

15:37.866 --> 15:39.900
We need to keep an eye on
the aft hydraulic system.

15:39.943 --> 15:40.631
OK.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.126
- Instrument check?
- Complete, and correct.

16:07.872 --> 16:11.236
- The boat... is going!
- Hurry uuuuuup!

16:11.272 --> 16:12.812
Wait for me!

16:19.187 --> 16:20.585
They're going!

16:21.152 --> 16:23.224
Don't be too long.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.817
Wait for me!

16:35.355 --> 16:36.869
Goodbye!

16:46.276 --> 16:48.516
Bye, dad, bye.

17:23.721 --> 17:24.950
He is coming.

17:25.642 --> 17:26.996
Be careful.

17:28.521 --> 17:30.435
Admiral on deck!

17:30.602 --> 17:31.637
Carry on.

17:32.122 --> 17:33.192
Coffee.

17:45.084 --> 17:49.477
Pair-up the frigates.
Redeploy North 16.5.

17:49.885 --> 17:50.920
Yes sir.

17:51.965 --> 17:53.797
Must I do everything myself?

17:53.965 --> 17:55.160
No, sir.

18:03.886 --> 18:05.658
- A grand sight.
- Yes.

18:07.647 --> 18:10.639
20 years ago, for this exercise,

18:11.568 --> 18:14.481
we had three times
this number of ships.

18:15.247 --> 18:17.622
Now half of them
rust in dry dock.

18:20.088 --> 18:24.288
Two-thirds of our submarines
are being cut apart for scrap.

18:28.850 --> 18:31.046
Do you remember the Kutusov?

18:31.530 --> 18:33.630
- My first command.
- Uh-hmm.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.886
It has off-loaded its missiles,

18:36.171 --> 18:40.051
and is delivering meat and vegetables
to our base at Poliarny.

18:40.691 --> 18:42.603
Now if the Americans attack,

18:42.771 --> 18:45.232
the Kutuzov can throw
cabbage at them.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.683
Still it's impressive.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.540
More than enough to send a message
to our enemies.

18:52.052 --> 18:55.728
Now all we have to do is
figure out who our enemies are.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.168
Commodore Russell.

19:01.214 --> 19:03.524
Deputy flag officer, submarines.

19:03.774 --> 19:05.395
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:10.455 --> 19:11.934
I'm scored out on
the Russian exercise.

19:12.096 --> 19:15.248
57 surface ships er,
3 detected submarines.

19:15.456 --> 19:19.450
An Oscar-II, the Kursk,
departed Vidyayevo at 07:20.

19:20.017 --> 19:20.892
Sonics?

19:21.057 --> 19:22.536
Silent and invisible.

19:23.177 --> 19:24.690
Oscar class.

19:25.777 --> 19:29.055
Thank goodness the Russians don't have
the money to build more of those things.

19:29.697 --> 19:33.453
Least we could hear the Typhoons,
so we didn't bump into them.

19:33.738 --> 19:37.653
Amazing to think that the Russians,
used to do one of these every year.

19:38.339 --> 19:39.889
- Morning.
- Morning sir.

19:40.019 --> 19:42.899
- Is Admiral Grudzinsky on Klite?
- At sea and in command.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.017
You know him, don't you sir?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.061
Met him. We fished.

19:49.780 --> 19:50.976
And drank.

19:52.261 --> 19:53.854
Yes, too much, in my case.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.457
So, Admiral Grudzinsky.

19:58.581 --> 20:00.811
What have you got up your sleeve?

20:30.986 --> 20:34.104
Officer of the watch,
take us to 28 metres.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.099
Come around to 085.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.099
When you've got control,
come up to 20 knots.

20:38.267 --> 20:41.544
28 metres, 085, and 20 knots, sir.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.784
Type of arms?

20:42.948 --> 20:45.747
24 SS-16 missiles,
21 L-55 torpedoes,

20:45.908 --> 20:48.184
and one HP practice torpedo.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.497
The Fat Girl?

20:49.669 --> 20:51.466
- Status?
- Stable.

20:52.149 --> 20:55.301
HPs, I hate them.
Cheap and dangerous.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.263
135.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.069
I've the watch.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.706
I'll be happy when it's time
to say goodbye to it.

21:16.912 --> 21:18.232
Attention!

21:19.992 --> 21:21.266
At ease.

21:24.953 --> 21:27.866
The exercise will have three phases.

21:28.594 --> 21:30.152
Test missile fired.

21:30.313 --> 21:32.032
Test torpedo fired.

21:32.194 --> 21:34.584
Return to base, undetected.

21:34.834 --> 21:36.063
Reactor status?

21:37.114 --> 21:38.788
Both reactors online, sir.

21:38.955 --> 21:40.389
Armament?

21:41.835 --> 21:44.304
Our test torpedo's currently stable,

21:44.516 --> 21:47.269
but has a slightly elevated
internal temperature,

21:47.596 --> 21:50.110
indicating a possible
hydrogen peroxide leak.

21:50.316 --> 21:51.512
Noted.

21:51.557 --> 21:55.234
We'll get rid of it as soon as
we reach our fire authorisation window.

21:55.437 --> 21:57.476
- Anything else?
- No.

21:58.197 --> 21:59.028
Fallout.

22:42.043 --> 22:43.239
Tube cleared.

22:43.643 --> 22:44.713
Prepare to load.

22:48.964 --> 22:52.199
Sir, temperature spike. 142, rising.

22:54.885 --> 22:57.843
Command priority carmady,
to speak to the captain.

23:02.406 --> 23:03.965
This is the captain.

23:04.366 --> 23:07.961
Sir, our test torpedo's angry.
142 degrees and rising.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.601
148.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.639
Request permission to fire prior
to authorised window.

23:16.248 --> 23:18.808
Are we still below abort threshold?

23:19.408 --> 23:20.603
Yes sir.

23:21.528 --> 23:24.601
We're 7 minutes from
our fire authorisation window,

23:24.769 --> 23:26.487
and we're not in position.

23:26.729 --> 23:28.242
Permission denied.

23:32.090 --> 23:33.205
Yes sir.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.359
By the book.

23:47.612 --> 23:48.807
152.

23:55.493 --> 23:57.052
Say your prayers.

23:58.173 --> 23:59.208
I'm not a religious man.

24:36.759 --> 24:38.569
- Secure the compartment.
- Secure the compartment.

24:38.605 --> 24:39.560
Secure all..

24:40.139 --> 24:41.538
All valves closed.

24:42.527 --> 24:44.098
Secure the forward bulkhead.

24:44.259 --> 24:47.297
Secure bulkhead doors,
all valves closed.

24:53.621 --> 24:54.409
Command.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.914
Command this is compartment 7,
come in.

24:57.021 --> 24:59.181
Command this is compartment 7,
come in.

24:59.221 --> 25:01.531
- Why isn't command responding?
- Because they're dead, that's why.

25:01.590 --> 25:02.242
Quiet.

25:02.278 --> 25:04.416
- Why are we not surfacing?
- Why do you think?

25:04.464 --> 25:05.499
Quiet!

25:08.783 --> 25:11.138
Command, this compartment 7, come in.

25:12.983 --> 25:15.584
Command, this compartment 7, come in.

25:23.024 --> 25:25.585
Sir, there's a fire
in the torpedo room.

25:25.745 --> 25:27.224
Detonation temperature?

25:29.105 --> 25:32.257
I think the warheads
explode at 1-180°.

25:32.425 --> 25:33.655
How much?

25:34.766 --> 25:36.101
180°.

25:47.187 --> 25:48.606
That's off the scale.

26:02.189 --> 26:03.259
What are we going to do?

26:03.430 --> 26:04.943
As we've trained, secure compart...

26:44.196 --> 26:47.234
Go west ward, to compartment 9!

26:48.556 --> 26:50.354
Pavel and Anton are forward.

26:56.677 --> 26:58.315
Go to compartment 9.

26:59.357 --> 27:01.746
Leave him on the platform,
go to compartment 9.

27:08.199 --> 27:09.314
Move on!

27:10.499 --> 27:11.548
Anton!

27:11.799 --> 27:12.799
Anton!

27:21.320 --> 27:24.120
Compartment 5, this is
compartment 7, come in.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.995
Compartment 5.

27:27.161 --> 27:29.755
Compartment 5, this is
compartment 7, come in.

27:30.401 --> 27:31.995
Mikhail, they're gone.

27:32.052 --> 27:33.956
Compartment 5, this is
compartment 7, come in.

27:34.082 --> 27:36.312
Let's just go. Let's go.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.082
85. Mikhail?

27:38.242 --> 27:41.361
Anton, we're in 7.
W-what's your status?

27:42.283 --> 27:43.953
The reactor's melting down.

27:44.643 --> 27:46.680
Emergency cooling is inoperative.

27:46.843 --> 27:47.674
Get out of there.

27:47.843 --> 27:50.074
We can't leave, or it's Chernobyl.

27:50.244 --> 27:52.633
We've got to activate
convection cooling.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.239
What's the water level?

27:54.764 --> 27:56.244
It's rising. Fast.

28:00.565 --> 28:01.605
Mikhail?

28:04.926 --> 28:06.644
Tell Vera I love her.

28:07.646 --> 28:08.681
Goodbye.

28:09.847 --> 28:10.962
Goodbye.

28:32.329 --> 28:33.524
Move move move!

28:33.689 --> 28:35.442
Close compartment 9!

28:57.773 --> 28:59.327
Is anyone here?

29:05.174 --> 29:06.164
Go go go!

29:08.014 --> 29:09.705
- Peter!
- Peter!

29:23.056 --> 29:24.251
Leo, come!

29:26.136 --> 29:27.472
Don't touch me!

29:30.257 --> 29:31.406
Wake up!

29:31.857 --> 29:32.707
Wake up!

29:34.558 --> 29:36.336
Help me. Help.

29:39.418 --> 29:41.089
Move it. Move it!

30:18.983 --> 30:20.702
Sir, do we exactly know
what happened?

30:20.864 --> 30:22.013
Not sure.

30:22.183 --> 30:23.822
So why are we alive?

30:24.904 --> 30:27.039
We are aft, that's why we are alive.

30:29.144 --> 30:30.721
The explosion was
forward and we are aft,

30:30.757 --> 30:32.578
so the bulkheads
protected us from it.

30:32.945 --> 30:34.584
What are we going to do?

30:35.226 --> 30:38.185
Let's use the hatch,
and get the hell out of here.

30:38.906 --> 30:40.579
We're taking on water.

30:40.826 --> 30:43.341
No. No, first things first.

30:45.027 --> 30:48.986
We stabilize the compartment,
we inventory our assets,

30:49.148 --> 30:52.937
and then.. then we evaluate
our escape options.

30:53.108 --> 30:55.379
- Does everyone understand that?
- Yes sir!

30:55.428 --> 30:56.577
Very good.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.548
- Maxim and Niko..
- Yes?

30:58.709 --> 31:02.230
We shut down the compartment.
Now you purge the main pipes,

31:02.469 --> 31:06.311
- then check list, from forward to aft.
- Yes sir.

31:06.381 --> 31:08.356
- Boris, you work on the pump.
- Yes sir.

31:08.489 --> 31:09.886
And Sasha.. Sash,
where are you?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.879
Get the hammer, we need
to let them know we're alive.

31:14.271 --> 31:18.583
OK, 4 strikes, repeatedly.
Every hour, on the hour.

31:18.791 --> 31:19.861
4 strikes.

31:21.492 --> 31:26.033
5, 4, 3, 2, 1..

31:43.275 --> 31:45.792
Get me a closer on their Barents
Sea, northeast of Murmansk.

31:45.828 --> 31:46.666
Yes sir.

31:46.788 --> 31:49.690
- And bring up maritime traffic, please.
- Yes sir, bring it up now.

31:49.933 --> 31:52.670
Get me a satellite picture, get me
a better satellite picture than that please.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.801
Yep, closer on that.
What's that?

31:55.917 --> 31:56.988
Whadda we have?

31:57.060 --> 31:58.699
The Russian frigates
are running grids,

31:58.751 --> 32:01.573
and the rest of the fleet is
sailing in short radius circles.

32:02.237 --> 32:04.433
"Seismic events."
Be more specific.

32:04.637 --> 32:07.437
One small, one large,
3.9 on the Richter.

32:07.638 --> 32:10.152
11:28 hours. Two minutes apart.

32:12.079 --> 32:13.399
Mother of God.

32:14.279 --> 32:15.931
They've lost a submarine.

32:18.319 --> 32:21.290
- Get me the Norsar Seismic readouts for the Barents Sea.
- Yes sir.

32:21.566 --> 32:24.898
David, ask the Americans to reroute
Satcom 3 for photos of Vidyayevo

32:24.960 --> 32:27.315
- and the other Murmansk secondary ports.
- Yes sir.

32:29.241 --> 32:30.117
Bruce...

32:30.881 --> 32:33.395
place a call to Russian
Northern Fleet headquarters.

32:33.601 --> 32:35.672
- To?
- Admiral Grudzinsky.

32:35.842 --> 32:37.879
Should I, clear that
with NATO HQ first, sir?

32:38.042 --> 32:41.042
- I wanted you to clear it first I'd have told you so.
- Yes sir.

32:42.322 --> 32:44.678
- Admiral on deck!
- As you were.

32:47.083 --> 32:47.834
Account makes...

32:48.844 --> 32:50.163
Two acoustic events..

32:50.323 --> 32:53.476
- How big?
- Unclear. Our instruments were pinned.

32:53.684 --> 32:55.722
I need location and boat.

32:55.924 --> 32:58.797
- Kursk?
- Get the Dronov ready to be sent down.

32:59.885 --> 33:01.398
- Understood?
- Yes sir.

33:04.846 --> 33:06.279
What are we hearing?

33:07.325 --> 33:10.079
One explosion,
then a second explosion,

33:10.246 --> 33:15.097
which was really multiple explosions,
that landed almost simultaneously.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.601
Granite missiles.

33:16.767 --> 33:18.485
More likely torpedoes.

33:19.407 --> 33:22.958
- Any word from the Northern Fleet?
- Nothing yet, they haven't responded.

33:23.328 --> 33:24.363
Survivors?

33:26.088 --> 33:28.478
Well there were two explosions,
very big.

33:28.689 --> 33:32.922
And the American satellite data shows
the Russian rescue assets still docked.

33:48.211 --> 33:49.121
Mum?

33:49.771 --> 33:51.205
Good or bad?

33:53.171 --> 33:54.446
They're small.

33:55.453 --> 33:56.681
Taste good.

33:57.573 --> 33:59.085
Put them in the basket.

34:00.052 --> 34:01.646
They're very small.

34:02.413 --> 34:04.006
Baby mushrooms.

34:04.853 --> 34:06.652
We can put them in the soup.

34:22.815 --> 34:23.886
Let's go.

34:37.297 --> 34:39.174
The water's rising fast.

34:40.058 --> 34:42.208
It's up 1.5 metres.

34:42.379 --> 34:43.857
We are trying to fix it.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.453
Pass the wrench.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.009
- We need more cloth.
- Leo, bring me the cloth.

34:48.059 --> 34:50.290
- Give him some cloth.
- Move, move, move!

34:50.460 --> 34:52.659
OK go get me the clubs. The clubs.

34:52.739 --> 34:54.210
- Niko, come on.
- OK, good.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.250
I got the club.

35:31.665 --> 35:33.099
Boys how're ya doin'
without the pump?

35:34.345 --> 35:36.780
- We need that pump now.
- I'm on it, I'm on it!

35:38.266 --> 35:40.655
We're connecting it
to the reserve batteries.

35:42.586 --> 35:43.656
It's on.

35:44.347 --> 35:46.145
Get the milk and check
if there is suction.

35:46.307 --> 35:47.706
Hand me milk.

35:48.387 --> 35:49.866
Check the suction.

36:14.871 --> 36:17.185
That will slow it down
but it won't stop it.

36:18.991 --> 36:22.427
Boris, make sure the pump stays on.
We still have water coming in.

36:22.631 --> 36:23.621
Yes sir.

36:23.792 --> 36:26.386
Niko go find blankets,
we need to stay warm.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.309
Prepare the oxygen generator as well.

36:37.754 --> 36:41.873
Do not activate without me
reviewing the procedure with you.

36:43.474 --> 36:44.384
Leo?

36:47.115 --> 36:48.530
What's going on?

36:50.235 --> 36:52.796
- You're going to make it.
- I'm scared.

36:54.395 --> 36:56.273
Listen to me, listen to me.

36:56.637 --> 36:59.755
Imagine you're on the surface and
your friends are trapped down here.

36:59.957 --> 37:02.194
You would move heaven and earth,
to save them.

37:02.717 --> 37:05.676
- Nothing would be too much. Not, nothing.
- Nothing.

37:05.817 --> 37:08.477
Right.
Everything we would do for them,

37:08.537 --> 37:10.435
they will do for us.

37:11.398 --> 37:13.530
- Yes sir.
- Do you believe that?

37:16.599 --> 37:17.429
Okay?

37:18.639 --> 37:19.674
Yes sir.

37:39.602 --> 37:40.831
Any idea?

37:48.803 --> 37:50.522
Sir it's, it's not working.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.796
We'll get it fixed.
We're almost there, sir.

38:23.127 --> 38:24.288
My God!

38:25.248 --> 38:26.318
Worse.

38:27.128 --> 38:29.165
Much worse than I expected.

38:30.369 --> 38:32.280
No one could survive that.

38:50.171 --> 38:53.050
It's the Kursk. Something happened.

38:53.212 --> 38:55.043
- What?
- I'm sorry.

38:55.212 --> 38:56.247
Ilina!

38:59.333 --> 39:00.193
Hi Mum!

39:01.133 --> 39:01.928
Hi.

39:04.853 --> 39:06.593
- Anastasia!
- I know I-I know what to do.

39:06.633 --> 39:08.927
- What have you heard?
- That they lost contact with it.

39:09.094 --> 39:10.191
When?

39:10.472 --> 39:12.009
- How long's it been?
- I don't know.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.334
I heard it from the fire.

39:15.494 --> 39:17.213
- Who told you that?
- Dacha.

39:17.375 --> 39:19.495
Danil's sister said
everything is fine.

39:19.535 --> 39:21.804
- Are they trapped?
- Well who knows?

39:22.695 --> 39:23.646
What are we doing?

39:25.696 --> 39:26.890
Find Vadim.

39:27.056 --> 39:30.129
- I'll try headquarters, see if I can find out anything.
- OK

39:30.297 --> 39:31.635
- We'll meet at Vera's.
- Yes.

39:33.697 --> 39:35.927
Don't worry, we're
finding out what happened.

39:48.459 --> 39:50.769
Has anything happened to the Kursk?

39:50.890 --> 39:53.137
Well, I uhm... don't know
anything about that.

39:53.419 --> 39:56.299
Have you heard anything?
Can you tell me?

39:56.460 --> 39:57.858
I can't tell you things I don't know.

39:58.180 --> 40:02.201
Actually even if I did know, I wouldn't
be authorised to tell you, I'm sorry.

40:06.701 --> 40:08.419
Captain Timoshenko!

40:08.982 --> 40:10.601
- Captain!
- Yes?

40:11.621 --> 40:13.977
We heard something
happened to the Kursk.

40:15.062 --> 40:18.021
I was just called here
for a meeting so, excuse me.

40:34.664 --> 40:37.537
God forbid the Navy should tell us
what's happening, right?

40:37.906 --> 40:39.418
This is bullshit.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.219
What should we do?

40:42.545 --> 40:44.823
We let the Navy do its work.

40:44.926 --> 40:48.860
I mean, they will do anything
in their power to get them home.

40:49.227 --> 40:51.059
But we need to know what's happening.

40:51.227 --> 40:52.422
Yes.

40:57.068 --> 41:01.939
What 30 years ago, when Anton
was much younger than Misha is now,

41:02.108 --> 41:04.463
and his father worked on the Kiev.

41:05.548 --> 41:07.460
There was a fire o-on the submarine,

41:07.670 --> 41:11.061
and she was on the bottom
for three weeks.

41:11.229 --> 41:13.028
I didn't know a thing.

41:13.470 --> 41:17.259
The Navy, protected me
as it saved Vadim.

41:17.651 --> 41:20.267
Their comrades will do their duty.

41:20.911 --> 41:23.146
Your duty is to wait and hope.

41:33.112 --> 41:34.307
Coffee?

41:39.913 --> 41:42.627
I didn't say goodbye to Anton
when he left.

41:45.435 --> 41:47.027
I was mad because..

41:52.075 --> 41:55.706
He, he swore he'd fix the
broken window by the sink.

41:57.756 --> 42:00.145
I didn't even kiss him goodbye.

42:04.637 --> 42:07.256
Maybe that was
our last moment together.

42:10.518 --> 42:12.235
And I snapped at him.

42:13.638 --> 42:15.231
He knew you loved him.

42:15.958 --> 42:16.914
He knew?

42:17.878 --> 42:18.755
He knows it.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.559
You have to stay strong.

42:27.079 --> 42:29.932
- We have to stay strong.
- Yeah.. okay.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.480
We have no choice.

42:47.203 --> 42:48.352
Captain!

42:50.283 --> 42:52.274
Go Misha, please go there.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.719
- I'm Tanya Averina.
- Yes I know.

42:57.883 --> 42:59.397
I know Mikhail.

43:00.004 --> 43:02.360
Is it our only rescue ship, right?

43:07.125 --> 43:09.725
If they were alive,
you would be on your way.

43:13.686 --> 43:14.835
I'm sorry.

43:16.726 --> 43:18.000
I'm sorry.

43:44.530 --> 43:45.759
I have it.

43:55.531 --> 43:56.966
No oxygen.

43:57.691 --> 43:59.683
C2O2 is gone.

44:00.252 --> 44:02.528
We have to start the
oxygen generator.

44:03.292 --> 44:04.044
Oleg.

44:05.013 --> 44:07.833
- We need the cartridges to ignite the generator.
- I know

44:07.893 --> 44:09.993
- Oleg.
- I know. I know.

44:30.096 --> 44:31.131
Shit!

44:31.737 --> 44:33.090
What's the matter?

44:33.496 --> 44:34.976
We don't have any cartridges.

44:35.037 --> 44:36.892
- What?
- We don't have any cartridges!

44:36.937 --> 44:39.987
- Well are you sure, there must be somewhere.
- We looked everywhere.

44:40.037 --> 44:41.137
They must be somewhere.

44:41.297 --> 44:44.138
But sir, there are cartridges
in Compartment 8

44:44.188 --> 44:45.655
in the lower section, uh?

44:45.818 --> 44:48.128
Gave them to Timour myself.

44:48.198 --> 44:49.934
Compartment 8 is flooded.

44:52.538 --> 44:54.052
We can't go down there.

45:32.024 --> 45:32.844
Boris.

45:33.824 --> 45:35.657
Boris get the pump running.

45:37.304 --> 45:38.739
I will help you.

46:00.748 --> 46:01.579
Ready.

46:10.029 --> 46:11.509
Emergency power.

46:31.552 --> 46:33.065
Fleet command.

46:33.752 --> 46:35.102
All engines stop.

46:35.152 --> 46:36.666
Audio test confirmed.

46:36.952 --> 46:39.553
If there's anything to hear,
let's make sure we hear it.

46:39.593 --> 46:40.788
Cut the engines.

46:41.713 --> 46:42.590
Confirmed.

47:03.117 --> 47:04.595
Fifteen seconds.

47:17.318 --> 47:18.592
On the hour.

47:18.838 --> 47:19.908
Mark.

47:46.802 --> 47:48.873
Are you sure the audio is working?

47:49.043 --> 47:52.413
Yes sir, we've got ambient sea noise
and current flow.

47:53.043 --> 47:54.078
Nothing.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.355
We're on the hour.

48:16.566 --> 48:17.681
Passed it.

48:18.566 --> 48:19.283
What?

48:19.606 --> 48:21.883
We've passed it,
you need to do the strike.

48:22.127 --> 48:25.738
Uh, sorry.
Sorry, I-I sold my watch.

48:45.090 --> 48:47.479
Contact the Rudnitsky. Now!

48:47.770 --> 48:48.840
Get the Rudnitsky.

49:13.373 --> 49:15.386
- Tanya Averina?
- Yes.

49:15.533 --> 49:17.933
- I am Koulkin.
- Yes.

49:18.334 --> 49:21.087
They heard, thumping from Kursk.

49:26.375 --> 49:27.490
Thank you.

49:27.895 --> 49:30.324
Marina! Marina!

49:30.496 --> 49:33.176
Daria! Daria!

49:34.176 --> 49:35.176
Marina!

49:36.376 --> 49:38.373
- What?
- They heard something!

49:38.416 --> 49:40.376
- What?
- They heard something!

49:40.416 --> 49:41.691
You sure...?

49:41.857 --> 49:43.787
They are alive, Averina!

49:44.257 --> 49:47.078
- They heard knocking.
- Heard knocking?

49:47.297 --> 49:49.263
The rescue gotta get it's way.

49:50.978 --> 49:51.775
Yes!

49:52.178 --> 49:54.378
They are alive, they are alive!

49:55.004 --> 49:57.279
Tony get me a live feed
from Vidyayevo satellite

49:57.370 --> 49:59.480
and keep an eye on all images
north-east of Murmansk.

49:59.601 --> 50:01.478
It's the Kursk that's down.

50:01.900 --> 50:06.498
A ship left Vidyayevo two hours ago
with a rescue submersible on deck.

50:06.701 --> 50:09.580
- There are survivors.
- Which rescue submersible?

50:09.781 --> 50:12.481
The Russians had three
functional rescue submersibles.

50:12.531 --> 50:15.732
The Mir was sold
to an American company which

50:15.782 --> 50:19.615
uses it to take rich tourists
down to see the Titanic at

50:19.822 --> 50:21.336
$20,000 a pop.

50:21.503 --> 50:24.780
Their A-32's stuck in the Black Sea,
with stabilizer problems

50:24.943 --> 50:26.342
which leaves the Priz,

50:26.503 --> 50:29.859
which is a bucket of bolts,
I wouldn't trust it in a bathtub.

50:30.023 --> 50:32.254
Have the Russians requested our help?

50:32.424 --> 50:35.098
My repeated calls into Admiral Grudzinsky
of the Northern Fleet..

50:35.265 --> 50:37.834
No response. But he's no fool.

50:37.884 --> 50:40.335
The Kursk has more secrets on it
than any ship in their navies.

50:40.385 --> 50:43.685
Cryptography, propulsion, weapon systems,
they're not going to let us go anywhere near it.

50:43.825 --> 50:44.701
We'll see.

50:44.865 --> 50:48.062
In the meantime, I want the LR-5 prepped,
and loaded and ready for air-transport

50:48.128 --> 50:49.030
and I want a list

50:49.066 --> 50:51.349
of all dive-platforms
and saturation divers from

50:51.385 --> 50:53.622
- the North Sea to the coast of Finland.
- Yes sir.

51:01.428 --> 51:02.407
You wait.

51:08.109 --> 51:08.904
Hi.

51:09.589 --> 51:10.987
- No.
- Why?

51:11.469 --> 51:12.504
I said no.

51:30.032 --> 51:33.592
Let me begin by saying,
that I will make all efforts

51:33.632 --> 51:36.709
to share with you
available information.

51:37.552 --> 51:40.943
That said, you must understand
there are security issues

51:41.113 --> 51:45.187
that may prevent certain information
from being shared to this day.

51:46.713 --> 51:47.510
So..

51:48.554 --> 51:49.874
The Russian Navy,

51:50.034 --> 51:52.503
and in particular the northern fleet,

51:52.714 --> 51:54.751
has a long and proud history

51:54.915 --> 51:58.495
of defending our nation
and the brave sailors who served..

51:58.515 --> 51:59.869
Captain.

52:00.196 --> 52:01.296
Captain.

52:01.316 --> 52:03.034
Excuse me for interrupting,

52:03.196 --> 52:06.771
but we've been told that there
is tapping from inside the Kursk.

52:07.796 --> 52:08.912
Is that true?

52:11.117 --> 52:13.313
I cannot speak to that issue.

52:15.237 --> 52:17.797
All I can tell you is that
the Russian Navy,

52:17.838 --> 52:19.762
and in particular
the Northern Fleet..

52:19.813 --> 52:22.148
- Why won't he say anything?
- has a long and proud history..

52:22.198 --> 52:26.076
I'm so.. sorry, Captain but we've all
come here for some information.

52:26.239 --> 52:28.321
I mean can you.. tell us anything?

52:28.439 --> 52:31.751
- About the tapping please?
- Do you know their condition?

52:32.120 --> 52:35.317
- How much air they have.
- And what is being done to save them sir?

52:35.880 --> 52:36.916
Tell us!

52:37.240 --> 52:41.401
- How long do they have, please?
- Anything you can tell us, anything..

52:42.761 --> 52:43.876
Please!

52:45.241 --> 52:46.311
I'm sorry.

52:46.922 --> 52:47.957
I'm very sorry.

52:49.322 --> 52:52.201
I'm very sorry, but I've..
I've nothing more to tell you.

52:54.602 --> 52:56.938
Tell us! When are they coming back?

52:57.283 --> 52:59.274
- Please!
- Captain!

52:59.797 --> 53:01.940
It's not the way
you should have acted.

53:02.884 --> 53:04.904
- They want you to trust them.
- No.

53:05.204 --> 53:07.719
- What if I don't?
- You should!

53:08.242 --> 53:09.400
Excuse me.

53:51.451 --> 53:52.770
Is Dad dead?

53:54.851 --> 53:55.966
I don't know.

53:56.811 --> 53:58.290
You think he's dead?

53:59.811 --> 54:01.245
Hope he's OK.

54:02.812 --> 54:03.927
Me too.

54:38.776 --> 54:39.766
Niko.

54:48.218 --> 54:50.688
Wake up. Wake up.

54:54.618 --> 54:55.892
You hear me?

54:56.098 --> 54:58.773
We have to stay awake. Stay with us.

55:17.142 --> 55:20.172
- I have to go through the floor hatch.
- Careful now.

55:20.222 --> 55:22.522
It has to be done. We need oxygen.

55:22.942 --> 55:24.522
You won't make it.

55:27.263 --> 55:28.323
Leo!

55:28.423 --> 55:29.059
Yes sir.

55:29.223 --> 55:30.497
What one can you deport them in?

55:30.663 --> 55:32.973
I-I don't know,
I left before he stowed 'em.

55:33.144 --> 55:35.458
- You don't know?
- Lower section.

55:39.344 --> 55:41.225
It will take some time to find them.

55:41.584 --> 55:43.337
I need someone to come with me.

55:43.505 --> 55:45.461
Sacha. Sasha!

55:45.905 --> 55:48.026
Help me get the oxygen cartridges.

55:51.746 --> 55:53.126
Leo, hurry up.

55:55.546 --> 55:58.061
This is a crazy plan. It's too far.

56:05.308 --> 56:06.303
Your arm.

56:06.408 --> 56:08.387
Come on, come on, your arm.

56:08.788 --> 56:09.584
Alright.

01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:04.773
Help him!

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:10.092
Take them out of the water!
Get the blankets!

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.995
Help me! Help me! Help me!

01:00:16.621 --> 01:00:17.691
Come on!

01:00:19.942 --> 01:00:21.137
Look at me!

01:00:24.542 --> 01:00:25.762
Take him out!

01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:27.013
Come on!

01:00:27.182 --> 01:00:28.502
Hold on, Sacha!

01:00:30.143 --> 01:00:31.178
Come on!

01:00:35.223 --> 01:00:36.214
Sacha!

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.264
You OK? You OK, you OK?

01:00:41.224 --> 01:00:42.564
Look at me. Look at me.

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.965
Where are the cartridges?
Where are the cartridges?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.800
Two boxes.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:24.629
10 cartridges each.

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:26.425
One down.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.309
19 to go.

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:32.263
What the hell took you so long?

01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:34.980
Can you tell a lot?

01:01:37.478 --> 01:01:40.279
And I forgot my swimsuit out there,
can you go back?

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:09.665
Watch out!

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:11.711
Careful!

01:02:12.557 --> 01:02:14.628
- Keeping!
- Watch it!

01:02:17.557 --> 01:02:20.027
Five men port side for the manoeuvre!

01:02:28.198 --> 01:02:30.155
Current just over one knot.

01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:35.014
Battery level 85%.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.596
Turnaround at 25%.

01:03:20.485 --> 01:03:22.318
Leo, below!

01:03:22.486 --> 01:03:23.521
Yes sir.

01:03:24.286 --> 01:03:26.519
- Hey hey hey be careful, be careful.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:03:26.686 --> 01:03:27.892
Be careful with this one.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.042
- Yes, I know.
- Listen to me.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.786
Have you done this in training?

01:03:31.886 --> 01:03:34.437
In theory.
That was on the short schedule.

01:03:34.487 --> 01:03:35.966
So you didn't.

01:03:36.887 --> 01:03:38.438
No water on this one.

01:03:38.488 --> 01:03:40.488
Are you listening?
No water on this one.

01:03:40.648 --> 01:03:41.427
No water.

01:03:41.528 --> 01:03:44.728
- Any contact with water and it will explode.
- Yeah, big fire.

01:03:44.764 --> 01:03:46.039
- Do you understand?
- Yes

01:03:46.075 --> 01:03:48.105
Big fire.
And then what happens?

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:50.883
- More oxygen.
- Exactly, we don't want that.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.490
- Always hold it, on the top.
- Yes sir.

01:03:59.931 --> 01:04:01.443
Here take the cartridge.

01:04:09.892 --> 01:04:11.326
OK, put it in.

01:04:14.292 --> 01:04:15.642
Now bring it down.

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:16.888
Lock it in.

01:04:21.693 --> 01:04:24.334
We'll approach it,
just beyond the reactors,

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:29.094
then let the current push us backward,
toward the aft escape hatch.

01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:14.701
What's that?

01:05:22.501 --> 01:05:23.697
They're here!

01:05:25.662 --> 01:05:27.061
It's them.

01:06:00.587 --> 01:06:02.224
Silence! Silence!

01:06:05.307 --> 01:06:06.707
Let's listen, let's listen!

01:06:07.468 --> 01:06:08.642
Let's wait.

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:21.185
- It's not connecting.
- We're in position.

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:23.209
- It's not making a seal.
- Why?

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:25.547
Battery's at 25%.

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:28.064
23.

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.010
- I not leaving until we seal.
- Well if we die, they die.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.067
We recharge and we come back.

01:06:34.831 --> 01:06:38.223
- Blowing ballast.
- Blowing ballast in 3,2,1..

01:06:42.191 --> 01:06:43.312
Full ahead.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:46.513
Come hard left.

01:06:46.573 --> 01:06:47.962
I can't hold it, I can't hold it.

01:06:48.012 --> 01:06:49.413
Watch out. Watch out!

01:06:53.314 --> 01:06:54.831
They hit the rudder!

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:56.664
They're surfacing.

01:06:56.714 --> 01:06:58.469
Whoa, yes, no.

01:06:59.714 --> 01:07:01.068
They're surfacing.

01:07:01.555 --> 01:07:02.704
You bastards!

01:07:03.195 --> 01:07:05.615
Come back! Come back, come back!

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:09.630
Come back!

01:07:10.516 --> 01:07:13.665
Come back! Come baaack!

01:07:14.157 --> 01:07:15.192
Quiet!

01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:17.816
Quiet!!

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.491
Please listen.

01:07:24.238 --> 01:07:25.596
They will try again.

01:07:25.697 --> 01:07:28.075
- But... but sir..
- Well trust me, they will.

01:07:28.238 --> 01:07:30.275
Wha... wha... what if they
still can't attach?

01:07:30.414 --> 01:07:32.769
Then swim to the surface,
through speed ascents.

01:07:32.843 --> 01:07:34.555
No!
They're right above us.

01:07:34.734 --> 01:07:36.532
You've seen the
rescue ship, right?

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:38.469
- Mihi, we have to leave now!
- No!

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:40.952
The rescue ship has
no decompression chamber.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.753
You will die of the bends,
you know that.

01:07:45.121 --> 01:07:46.554
You go, you die.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.116
We wait!

01:08:01.882 --> 01:08:03.157
We can't wait.

01:08:03.882 --> 01:08:05.623
We've done enough waiting.

01:08:05.683 --> 01:08:07.321
To hell with waiting!

01:08:21.885 --> 01:08:25.276
What happened?
Why couldn't you make the seal?

01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:27.840
I don't know sir.

01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:30.845
This is supposed
to be replaced annually.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:33.078
God knows how old this is.

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:34.675
The tail is damaged.

01:08:35.046 --> 01:08:36.446
So make the repair!

01:08:36.767 --> 01:08:37.598
Yes sir.

01:08:37.768 --> 01:08:38.978
Change out the batteries.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:40.921
Let's try again, quickly.

01:08:41.087 --> 01:08:45.028
We only have one set.
12 hour to recharge.

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:47.041
No extra batteries?

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:49.828
We were ordered to sell them
with the Mir.

01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:52.281
They're at the Titanic.

01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:18.002
So..

01:09:19.733 --> 01:09:23.124
This little polar bear goes
to his mother and says,

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.734
"I'm a polar bear, right?"

01:09:27.094 --> 01:09:29.323
And she says, "Yes, of course."

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:33.366
And the little polar bear says,
"OK, thanks."

01:09:36.015 --> 01:09:37.288
The next day,

01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:40.615
the little polar bear goes
to his mother again and says,

01:09:41.295 --> 01:09:43.136
"Let me if I got this right.."

01:09:44.216 --> 01:09:45.934
"You're a polar bear, right?"

01:09:46.095 --> 01:09:48.336
And she says: "Yes, of course."

01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:50.334
And then, little polar bear says,

01:09:50.497 --> 01:09:52.837
"And dad's a polar bear too, right?"

01:09:53.497 --> 01:09:55.886
And she says, "Yes, of course."

01:09:56.778 --> 01:09:58.788
And then the little polar bear says,

01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:01.938
"OK, fine, just checking."

01:10:05.979 --> 01:10:07.539
So the next day,

01:10:08.059 --> 01:10:11.211
the little polar bear goes
to his mother again and says,

01:10:12.299 --> 01:10:14.177
"I just gotta be clear here."

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.211
"You're a polar bear, right?"

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.770
And the mother says, "Yes."

01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:22.791
"And dad's a polar bear, right?"

01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:24.898
And she says, "Yes."

01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:27.457
"That makes me a polar bear, right?"

01:10:27.622 --> 01:10:29.180
She says "Yes."

01:10:29.582 --> 01:10:31.732
Then the little polar bear says,

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.593
"Then why am I so.."

01:10:33.623 --> 01:10:35.443
So fucking cold.

01:10:45.024 --> 01:10:46.378
Huh, sorry Oleg.

01:10:46.544 --> 01:10:49.058
"Then why am I so fucking cold?"

01:10:53.105 --> 01:10:54.145
Who the hell yeah.

01:11:03.746 --> 01:11:05.306
What's taking so long?

01:11:09.267 --> 01:11:10.447
And the collar?

01:11:10.507 --> 01:11:14.948
We're hoping that heating it up will,
enable the oil to penetrate and

01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:17.139
soften it enough to attach.

01:11:17.668 --> 01:11:19.421
And it's not reassuring.

01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:27.759
Carry on.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.626
The batteries are really charged!

01:11:46.472 --> 01:11:47.906
- Leo!
- Yes sir.

01:11:48.073 --> 01:11:49.222
Hammer!

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.040
What should I tell Moscow?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.760
I'll tell them, Asher.

01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:10.880
This is Admiral Grudzinsky
from the Northern Fleet.

01:13:11.483 --> 01:13:15.442
I need to communicate
with Commodore David Russell,

01:13:16.284 --> 01:13:17.680
Royal Navy.

01:13:18.404 --> 01:13:19.364
I'll put you through.

01:13:31.246 --> 01:13:32.356
Andrei!

01:13:32.406 --> 01:13:35.266
David! It's been too long!

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.276
It certainly has.

01:13:37.527 --> 01:13:38.722
What can I do?

01:13:40.487 --> 01:13:42.205
You've seen the Priz,

01:13:42.407 --> 01:13:44.284
and the Mikhail Rudnitsky.

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:48.218
It not built for the Barents Sea,
it's built for carrying lumber.

01:13:48.328 --> 01:13:49.669
You know how many survivors?

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:50.924
Unclear.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:53.569
Perhaps.. 20, 25.

01:13:56.169 --> 01:13:57.120
How bad is it?

01:13:57.169 --> 01:14:00.606
The compartments after the reactors,
appear intact.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.207
But everything else is, gone.

01:14:03.411 --> 01:14:05.924
Is there any chance your superiors
will let us in?

01:14:06.571 --> 01:14:09.121
Not until I try a sufficient
number of times,

01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:12.871
to do the impossible,
with the inadequate.

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:14.487
I understand.

01:14:15.372 --> 01:14:17.124
If there's anything I can do
besides standing by, let me know.

01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:19.772
There is one thing you could do.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:25.247
And so we are offering immediate
deployment, of the LR-5,

01:14:25.413 --> 01:14:28.406
our state-of-the
art rescue submersible,

01:14:28.574 --> 01:14:30.574
and anything else
the Russians need.

01:14:35.774 --> 01:14:39.525
And with Russian rescue assets
apparently unable to reach survivors,

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:43.011
offers of international assistance,
are now pouring in.

01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:45.926
Britain and France, Norway,
and the United States

01:14:45.976 --> 01:14:49.776
offering both technical help,
and rescue submersibles.

01:14:50.176 --> 01:14:54.710
And so we are offering
immediate deployment of the LR-5,

01:14:54.773 --> 01:14:56.830
our state-of-the-art
rescue submersible,

01:14:56.904 --> 01:14:58.781
and anything else
the Russians need.

01:15:00.418 --> 01:15:03.528
It has the potential to be,
a unique moment of collaboration,

01:15:03.578 --> 01:15:06.617
sweeping aside,
cold war suspicions.

01:15:06.898 --> 01:15:08.629
But so far inexplicably,

01:15:08.679 --> 01:15:10.779
there has been no clear response,

01:15:10.819 --> 01:15:14.336
from either the Kremlin,
or the admirals of the Northern Fleet.

01:15:14.939 --> 01:15:17.580
There are reasons to believe
that the initial cause,

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.381
was a collision,
with a non-Russian vessel.

01:15:20.587 --> 01:15:25.058
With submarines as silent as they are,
that is of course a constant danger,

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.099
made worse, of course,

01:15:27.262 --> 01:15:29.299
by the aggressiveness of NATO.

01:15:29.701 --> 01:15:32.782
How about the offers of foreign help,
are you gonna accept them?

01:15:33.422 --> 01:15:36.618
Uhm, that is unclear at this time.

01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:01.094
- Have luck.
- Yes sir.

01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:03.217
Boris, check the batteries.

01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:04.421
Yes sir.

01:16:10.227 --> 01:16:11.337
Batteries are dead!

01:16:12.674 --> 01:16:14.624
- Tell me is the pump is out.
- What do you mean?

01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:15.988
Water will be rising soon.

01:16:16.257 --> 01:16:18.262
- How much water?
- Wh... what do we do, the water is...?

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.590
Settle down. Settle down.

01:16:20.674 --> 01:16:23.064
Save your strength, save oxygen.

01:16:24.069 --> 01:16:25.582
Stay awake.

01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:43.425
Maxim, whaddaya doing?

01:16:47.112 --> 01:16:49.649
We should have done this
a long time ago.

01:16:51.152 --> 01:16:53.767
Maxim, get down from there.
Come back here!

01:16:53.803 --> 01:16:55.031
Maxim, get down!

01:17:00.114 --> 01:17:00.990
Come back!

01:17:02.794 --> 01:17:03.989
Get down!

01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:13.551
I want to live!

01:17:13.716 --> 01:17:14.466
Oh stop it!

01:17:23.757 --> 01:17:24.713
Stop it!

01:17:37.078 --> 01:17:37.896
Come back down!

01:17:37.932 --> 01:17:38.842
Stop it!

01:18:15.376 --> 01:18:17.101
That's why I believe
we should accept the

01:18:17.145 --> 01:18:19.101
British and Norwegian
offers of help.

01:18:20.264 --> 01:18:22.733
The survivors are only
in the aft section of the boat.

01:18:22.897 --> 01:18:25.984
We can limit foreign divers
and submersibles to that area.

01:18:26.117 --> 01:18:28.305
Those young men knew what
they were signing up for.

01:18:28.345 --> 01:18:29.193
Yes sir,

01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:31.870
those young men knew what they were
signing up for when they joined the Navy,

01:18:31.913 --> 01:18:33.213
but did their wives?

01:18:33.281 --> 01:18:36.478
You have your orders.
No foreign interference.

01:18:38.907 --> 01:18:40.306
Very well sir.

01:18:40.907 --> 01:18:42.102
I understand.

01:18:47.268 --> 01:18:48.497
Marina?

01:18:51.348 --> 01:18:53.259
Where's Vera?

01:18:53.989 --> 01:18:56.109
- She'll meet us there.
- Yeah.

01:18:56.169 --> 01:18:58.159
- Marina!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:59.259
Yeah, hurry up.

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:07.012
Attention everyone, Admiral Petrenko!

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:14.181
I know this is
a very difficult time for you.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:19.277
Speaking.. for myself and the president
I want to assure you

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:22.396
that we are doing
everything in our power,

01:19:22.552 --> 01:19:25.671
to bring out the men,
still on the Kursk.

01:19:25.993 --> 01:19:28.863
To that effect,
I will list the ships,

01:19:28.913 --> 01:19:30.543
that are on the sea.

01:19:31.313 --> 01:19:32.793
The flagship,

01:19:33.074 --> 01:19:34.109
Peter the Great.

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:37.346
The rescue vessel,
Mikhail Rudnitsky..

01:19:37.755 --> 01:19:39.670
Admiral, admiral.

01:19:41.675 --> 01:19:44.189
Wha-what is the status of the crew?

01:19:44.596 --> 01:19:46.507
Are you in communication with them?

01:19:46.676 --> 01:19:47.966
And who is alive?

01:19:48.596 --> 01:19:49.995
- Yes
- Who is alive?

01:19:50.876 --> 01:19:52.515
Are are are they injured?

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:54.788
An-and what about the foreign help?

01:19:56.237 --> 01:19:57.591
Have you accepted it?

01:19:57.877 --> 01:20:00.995
If you let me continue,
I will give you specifics.

01:20:01.157 --> 01:20:04.091
The offers of foreign assistance
are being considered.

01:20:04.158 --> 01:20:06.877
Meanwhile here is, what we know.

01:20:07.158 --> 01:20:08.876
The Kursk is intact,

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:10.552
and on the seabed.

01:20:11.198 --> 01:20:12.678
I-it is in a very

01:20:12.919 --> 01:20:15.791
difficult position and... uhm,

01:20:15.959 --> 01:20:18.235
at a depth of 500 metres

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.720
- and almost zero visibility,
- No!

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.521
- At a very steep angle.
- No!

01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:24.517
What?

01:20:24.561 --> 01:20:26.721
And there have been
strong underwater currents.

01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:29.640
The Barents Sea is nowhere
near that deep.

01:20:29.801 --> 01:20:31.917
Stability is like glass.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.237
We are confident that
our search and rescue...

01:20:35.442 --> 01:20:38.002
Th-the Barents Sea, is not that deep.

01:20:38.323 --> 01:20:40.883
And the visibility
is not what you say.

01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:44.537
- Are you an expert on underwater rescue?
- No.

01:20:44.683 --> 01:20:47.483
No then, leave this to those who are.

01:20:47.644 --> 01:20:49.202
I'm not an expert,

01:20:49.684 --> 01:20:51.880
but I am not a fool either.

01:20:52.325 --> 01:20:53.803
None of us are.

01:20:55.205 --> 01:20:56.684
OK, none of us are.

01:20:56.965 --> 01:20:58.603
You shouldn't lie.

01:21:00.085 --> 01:21:01.476
You're lying to us.

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:02.715
How dare you!

01:21:02.885 --> 01:21:04.763
I'll ask you the same question.

01:21:05.606 --> 01:21:07.438
We have children here.

01:21:08.086 --> 01:21:11.026
We.. we.. we have husbands.

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:14.685
Your husbands and sons,
are sailors in the Russian Navy.

01:21:14.847 --> 01:21:18.920
Every one of them took an oath
to defend his country with his life.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:22.203
The rescuers at the scene
are doing all they can.

01:21:22.488 --> 01:21:24.001
They are well equipped.

01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:27.028
They have the latest technology,
equal to

01:21:27.129 --> 01:21:30.729
or even superior to anything
offered by foreign nations.

01:21:30.809 --> 01:21:32.679
That's nonsense. That's nonsense,

01:21:32.729 --> 01:21:33.806
and ev-everyone knows it.

01:21:34.266 --> 01:21:36.319
Look sit down
and listen.

01:21:37.454 --> 01:21:39.351
Anger and insolence
lead to nothing.

01:21:39.431 --> 01:21:43.171
Well my husband.. my husband served..
In th-the Northern Fleet.

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.890
We are a Navy!

01:21:45.052 --> 01:21:47.168
We raised our son
to be Navy for what?

01:21:47.355 --> 01:21:49.355
To die, for nothing?

01:21:49.452 --> 01:21:52.532
Calm down, or you will be
removed from this hall.

01:21:52.852 --> 01:21:55.049
Tell us if they are still alive

01:21:55.221 --> 01:21:57.741
or how long they have
before they die.

01:21:57.862 --> 01:22:00.964
Calm down, or you will be removed.
You will be removed.

01:22:02.448 --> 01:22:03.673
Calm down.

01:22:03.934 --> 01:22:06.484
No!
No there is no time for this!

01:22:06.935 --> 01:22:09.590
You... you want our men to die,

01:22:09.647 --> 01:22:10.787
for nothing!

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.324
Damn you!

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:13.735
You are remiss!

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:15.535
You go to hell!

01:22:16.136 --> 01:22:17.694
You, and your admirals,

01:22:17.856 --> 01:22:19.449
and your bureaucrats...

01:22:20.376 --> 01:22:21.536
To hell with you!

01:22:21.616 --> 01:22:23.254
Where you put us,

01:22:23.456 --> 01:22:25.636
and our families, and our children!

01:22:27.017 --> 01:22:28.849
It is just for justice!

01:22:30.057 --> 01:22:32.838
What did you do to her?
What did you do?

01:22:40.139 --> 01:22:40.939
Shame!

01:23:26.025 --> 01:23:27.015
David...

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:31.145
I'd like to take you up on your
offer of assistance.

01:23:31.225 --> 01:23:34.502
- What changed?
- I dunno. Me?

01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:40.136
I'll pull divers from one of the
Norwegian rigs of the Asgard oil fields.

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:42.751
They can rendezvous with the LR-5 and me
in Trondheim, Norway.

01:23:42.787 --> 01:23:44.947
From there it's 11 hours
to the accident site.

01:23:51.668 --> 01:23:53.147
- Graham.
- David.

01:23:53.748 --> 01:23:56.949
This is Commodore David Russell.
We're working for him on this one.

01:23:56.989 --> 01:23:59.249
Very good to meet you gentlemen.
I appreciate what you're doing.

01:23:59.395 --> 01:24:00.213
Thank you sir.

01:24:00.291 --> 01:24:02.570
Right, before we go into the chair,
we have a look at the paperwork.

01:24:02.717 --> 01:24:04.778
We've been asked to sign
special waiver forms agreeing

01:24:04.814 --> 01:24:06.713
to dive without a
hyperbaric lifeboat,

01:24:06.846 --> 01:24:08.626
and not to hold
the Stolt Corporation liable

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.459
in the event of injury or
death related to, or caused by,

01:24:11.515 --> 01:24:13.489
nuclear radiation
or weapons of war.

01:24:40.674 --> 01:24:42.712
No Admiral Petrenko?

01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:43.945
He sent me.

01:24:44.675 --> 01:24:46.955
So you have taken over my command?

01:24:47.035 --> 01:24:49.855
Yes. And your rescue operation.

01:24:50.236 --> 01:24:52.756
And pending formal
transfer of command,

01:24:52.956 --> 01:24:54.390
the Northern Fleet.

01:24:57.717 --> 01:25:01.870
Commodore David Russell of the Royal Navy.
I'm aboard the Seaway Eagle.

01:25:02.037 --> 01:25:04.107
We're here at the request
of Admiral Grudzinsky.

01:25:04.198 --> 01:25:07.987
We're requesting permission
to approach the accident site, over.

01:25:10.758 --> 01:25:14.389
You're to maintain your current position
until further orders.

01:25:20.839 --> 01:25:21.988
Stop the engines.

01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.220
Mikhail.

01:26:41.011 --> 01:26:42.160
What is it?

01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:44.250
I need a pen.

01:26:44.851 --> 01:26:45.966
I have a pen.

01:26:57.942 --> 01:26:58.764
What is it?

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:00.123
Tell...

01:27:01.573 --> 01:27:03.107
How old were you,

01:27:03.173 --> 01:27:04.767
when your father died?

01:27:06.974 --> 01:27:08.274
I was three.

01:27:08.734 --> 01:27:09.963
Little lad.

01:27:12.294 --> 01:27:16.128
What cover.. W-what do you..
what do you remember about him?

01:27:21.976 --> 01:27:23.575
Tell me honestly.

01:27:24.896 --> 01:27:26.076
Nothing.

01:27:26.577 --> 01:27:27.777
Nuthin'.

01:27:33.817 --> 01:27:34.932
If Misha would..

01:27:35.978 --> 01:27:39.978
Have only a very vague,
memory of me. No!

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.899
Yes, the baby..

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.899
The baby will have none.

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.697
No, that's not true.

01:28:02.221 --> 01:28:03.981
I can feel my father.

01:28:06.702 --> 01:28:10.282
I know my mother loved him,
and I know that he loved me.

01:28:11.543 --> 01:28:15.282
And somehow, he's always
been a part of me.

01:28:15.631 --> 01:28:17.907
Things, I need to tell him that.

01:28:20.544 --> 01:28:21.659
Thank you.

01:29:01.749 --> 01:29:04.340
This is Graham Mann,
he heads up our dive team.

01:29:04.389 --> 01:29:07.781
Admiral Einar Skorgen,
NATO commander North-Norway.

01:29:07.849 --> 01:29:10.385
He's been instrumental
in getting all of this going.

01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:14.026
Now here's a, a list of things,
that needs attentive,

01:29:14.405 --> 01:29:17.995
uh... including your site surveys
and photographs of the accident site.

01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:20.595
And we'll send you any details.
Facts on the hatch.

01:29:20.631 --> 01:29:22.225
But all in good time.

01:29:22.552 --> 01:29:24.145
All in good time.

01:29:24.312 --> 01:29:26.303
Admiral, with all respect,

01:29:26.772 --> 01:29:28.949
uh... surely time is of the essence.

01:29:29.393 --> 01:29:30.269
Yes.

01:29:30.713 --> 01:29:34.672
Well we need to send down our ROVs
for a preliminary radiation check, site surveys..

01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:37.793
I think there has been a misunderstanding
regarding this meeting.

01:29:37.833 --> 01:29:38.594
What?

01:29:38.754 --> 01:29:42.668
The Russian rescue assets are
in position and functioning very well.

01:29:42.834 --> 01:29:46.031
Tomorrow the decision will be made whether
you and your men will be allowed,

01:29:46.195 --> 01:29:48.305
to participate in the operation.

01:29:48.595 --> 01:29:50.749
Did we come all this way for nothing?

01:29:51.395 --> 01:29:52.695
Admiral let me be frank.

01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:54.826
We have the divers,
and the equipment,

01:29:54.996 --> 01:29:58.149
to start bringing those men
to the surface, in a matter of hours.

01:29:58.876 --> 01:30:01.846
We don't know their condition,
I implore you to accept our help.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.998
If there are survivors, we can
bring them to the surface very quickly.

01:30:05.118 --> 01:30:07.234
I believe we've been very clear.

01:30:08.677 --> 01:30:10.148
When we reconvene,

01:30:10.198 --> 01:30:13.668
if your help is needed,
we will let you know.

01:30:17.919 --> 01:30:19.717
We look forward to your call.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.873
Why are they stalling?

01:30:28.041 --> 01:30:30.078
Their protecting their naval secrets,

01:30:30.321 --> 01:30:32.878
and trying to avoid
national humiliation.

01:30:33.081 --> 01:30:36.902
- It's not humiliating to lose their flagship sub?
- Not if they can blame it on us.

01:30:36.962 --> 01:30:39.802
A collision, or us not saving them?

01:30:39.842 --> 01:30:40.991
Maybe both.

01:30:41.162 --> 01:30:43.631
So what? We wait?

01:30:45.123 --> 01:30:46.318
We wait.

01:30:47.203 --> 01:30:48.921
And the men at the bottom?

01:30:50.844 --> 01:30:52.277
They wait too.

01:31:36.289 --> 01:31:38.209
- I can't hold it.
- We're missing it, we're missing it.

01:31:38.249 --> 01:31:39.880
Let's go for another attempt.

01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:41.509
OK, turning around.

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:45.005
Coming back. Placing a mark.

01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:49.191
Battery level's 25%.

01:31:49.211 --> 01:31:50.326
We're staying.

01:32:33.817 --> 01:32:35.808
Battery level's 12%.

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:41.778
Battery level's at 9%.

01:32:41.938 --> 01:32:43.531
Who shift up, who shift Alan.

01:32:43.698 --> 01:32:44.813
8%!

01:32:53.577 --> 01:32:54.604
Keep it!

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.777
Don't move it! Keep it still!

01:33:04.749 --> 01:33:05.639
You're moving!

01:33:05.741 --> 01:33:08.541
Battery level's at 7%,
we have to abort now.

01:33:08.593 --> 01:33:09.572
Abort!

01:33:15.822 --> 01:33:17.222
Open ballast.

01:33:17.698 --> 01:33:18.739
Rising.

01:33:29.758 --> 01:33:30.988
Ascending.

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.225
You hear tapping?

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:36.525
No, no tapping.

01:33:48.347 --> 01:33:50.304
Send in the Brits, at dawn.

01:33:53.547 --> 01:33:54.419
Sir.

01:33:54.827 --> 01:33:56.660
We're on tomorrow morning.

01:33:57.148 --> 01:33:59.601
Get the divers back, get them ready.

01:34:06.589 --> 01:34:09.030
Hey, friend,

01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:10.543
don't leave me.

01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:12.899
Stay with me.

01:34:20.911 --> 01:34:22.385
What the hell is this?

01:34:22.992 --> 01:34:24.584
Jesus Christ!

01:34:27.192 --> 01:34:28.866
I don't know about the rest of you,

01:34:30.072 --> 01:34:31.933
but I'm not ready to die.

01:34:46.474 --> 01:34:47.835
Good morning Kursk!

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:49.024
Good morning!

01:34:49.195 --> 01:34:51.391
Breakfast is about to be served.

01:34:52.435 --> 01:34:53.870
Leo, help me up.

01:35:02.436 --> 01:35:04.437
Hey everybody, wake up!

01:35:06.477 --> 01:35:08.468
Show me what you have, and ahh..

01:35:08.678 --> 01:35:12.138
Let's gather a nice, morning buffet.

01:35:13.637 --> 01:35:15.117
Come on, Sasha!

01:35:15.478 --> 01:35:16.913
Whadda you have there?

01:35:17.198 --> 01:35:18.143
Some tuna.

01:35:18.438 --> 01:35:20.032
Oh nice, seafood!

01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:23.669
We have some meat?

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.671
Brisket.

01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:26.058
Contains crackers?

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.189
Crackers?

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.533
What do you have guys?

01:35:35.081 --> 01:35:36.772
- What a coincidence!
- Tuna.

01:35:37.562 --> 01:35:39.279
Can't think about food right now.

01:35:49.083 --> 01:35:50.703
This is good, yeah!

01:35:51.003 --> 01:35:53.043
Finally the Navy
does something right.

01:35:57.724 --> 01:35:58.659
Niko.

01:35:59.404 --> 01:36:00.475
Where is it?

01:36:01.284 --> 01:36:03.321
- C'mon, get out of here.
- Where is it?

01:36:07.605 --> 01:36:08.845
Real breakfast!

01:36:09.885 --> 01:36:11.398
I got some more on that.

01:36:11.525 --> 01:36:12.524
Oh yeah!

01:36:13.406 --> 01:36:14.580
Can I get some?

01:36:17.126 --> 01:36:18.506
Keeps us warm.

01:36:19.727 --> 01:36:21.883
- This is really good, huh!
- Yeah.

01:36:22.287 --> 01:36:24.198
Maxim, look at this!

01:36:26.007 --> 01:36:27.726
There's everything here...

01:36:30.329 --> 01:36:32.606
- Do we actually wanna go up?
- No point, no!

01:36:33.449 --> 01:36:35.838
Not yet. We do not come down here.

01:36:36.089 --> 01:36:38.558
Will I tell my polar bear joke again?

01:36:42.209 --> 01:36:43.962
OK, shut up this time, please.

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.050
So, this little polar bear

01:36:47.130 --> 01:36:49.087
goes to his mother, and says...

01:36:49.579 --> 01:36:51.551
No more hearing,
have a drink instead.

01:36:54.676 --> 01:36:58.226
Leo, that's a blame you,
you little piece of shit.

01:36:59.852 --> 01:37:02.248
Leo.. Leo, be careful!

01:38:50.947 --> 01:38:52.723
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

01:38:56.387 --> 01:38:57.822
How long do we have?

01:38:59.468 --> 01:39:00.662
A couple minutes.

01:39:22.071 --> 01:39:23.709
It's been an honour..

01:39:24.911 --> 01:39:26.744
To serve with all of you.

01:40:16.398 --> 01:40:17.389
Sir.

01:40:18.519 --> 01:40:20.835
We're all, ready to go!

01:40:23.278 --> 01:40:23.950
Let's go!

01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:26.430
OK keep it moving,
check his oxygen will you?

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.830
- Divers at depth?
- Prep 206 metres.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.894
C'mon let's go!

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.356
Move it!

01:41:29.688 --> 01:41:32.840
We need to make sure
the hatch chamber is not flooded.

01:41:36.249 --> 01:41:37.398
Copy that.

01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:41.704
We'll need to open the pressure valve
and, see if there's any suction.

01:42:05.292 --> 01:42:07.443
The hatch chamber is flooded.

01:43:52.867 --> 01:43:54.660
No survivors.

01:44:46.674 --> 01:44:49.712
My Mikhail said that
those who'd gone to sea,

01:44:49.874 --> 01:44:51.672
are forever changed.

01:44:52.834 --> 01:44:55.907
He said that's why they're different
from the rest of us.

01:44:56.995 --> 01:44:58.827
Tied one to the other,

01:44:59.155 --> 01:45:00.651
by the sea.

01:45:02.476 --> 01:45:04.069
That's why sailors,

01:45:04.516 --> 01:45:06.116
rescue sailors.

01:45:07.636 --> 01:45:09.317
Even at war.

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.474
I don't know if we're at war.

01:45:15.558 --> 01:45:19.068
The men of the Kursk, can't tell us
what they think.

01:45:19.758 --> 01:45:22.018
But before he died my husband..

01:45:22.279 --> 01:45:24.316
Wrote a letter to me,

01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:27.052
to our son,

01:45:27.679 --> 01:45:30.220
and to our unborn child.

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.837
"No one has forever.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.154
"But I wanted more.

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:43.113
"I wanted to give you more.

01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:45.321
"More babies.

01:45:48.682 --> 01:45:50.953
"Love our son and the baby,

01:45:52.083 --> 01:45:53.622
"for both of us.

01:45:54.563 --> 01:45:57.555
"Tell them, again and again,

01:45:58.683 --> 01:46:00.124
"that I love them,

01:46:00.164 --> 01:46:01.723
"as I loved you.

01:46:03.484 --> 01:46:05.680
"Find another man to love,

01:46:06.444 --> 01:46:08.118
"but love me as well.

01:46:09.125 --> 01:46:10.724
"For though I am,

01:46:11.805 --> 01:46:13.725
"but a moment for you,

01:46:14.205 --> 01:46:15.924
"You are my forever."

01:48:49.145 --> 01:48:50.646
Misha Averin!

01:49:06.428 --> 01:49:07.648
Bravo.

01:49:07.948 --> 01:49:09.349
The church.

01:49:11.148 --> 01:49:13.048
I have something here.

01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:21.650
It was your father's.

01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:27.868
Thank you.

01:49:32.511 --> 01:49:33.651
Thank you.

01:49:49.522 --> 01:49:50.662
Mum.

01:50:10.914 --> 01:50:18.907
71 children lost their fathers on the Kursk.
