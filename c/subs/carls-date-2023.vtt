Now, don't eat it until I say "Go."

00:58.975 --> 01:00.268
All right.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.853

DUG: So good.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.231
-Try again.
-DUG: Yes.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.483
Wait until "Go"...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
DUG: Mmm!

01:08.526 --> 01:12.113
It's official. You really don't teach
old dogs new tricks.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.531
-(PHONE RINGS)
-DUG: I am old?

01:13.615 --> 01:15.075
I have no idea.

Fredricksen residence.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.370
Oh, hello, Miss Meyer!

01:20.121 --> 01:24.584
The senior center is gonna adopt
all of Muntz's dogs?

01:24.667 --> 01:26.336
(CHUCKLES) Thank you so much!

01:26.419 --> 01:27.504
DUG: Dawgs.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.548
You adopted one, too?

01:30.632 --> 01:33.301
And your dog wants to talk to my dog?

01:33.384 --> 01:34.511
Uh, hang on.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.595
Come here, Dug.

Dug, are you there? Come in, Dug.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.266

01:40.350 --> 01:42.310
ALPHA:
This is Beta. You are Alpha!

01:42.393 --> 01:44.687
Do you not remember this
which I am telling you now?

01:44.771 --> 01:48.191
-DUG: Oh, that is right. I am Alpha.

There is much fun
to be had and... Squirrel!

Where is the Squirrel?

-(BARKS)
-ALPHA: Bye, Dug!

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
I'm back.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.044
They do keep you on your toes.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.838
What's that?

02:09.921 --> 02:11.047
Oh!

02:11.131 --> 02:12.215
Okay.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.758
Uh-huh. Sure.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.510
Well, thanks again.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.678
Bye now!

02:18.638 --> 02:21.724
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is not good.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.184
DUG: What? What is not good?

02:27.063 --> 02:29.315
This is very, very bad.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733
DUG: What? What is it?

02:32.527 --> 02:33.528
Very bad.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.197
DUG: I feel so bad for you! (HOWLS)

02:36.281 --> 02:37.907
It's... It's Miss Meyer.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.534
Miss Meyer was mean
to my Poppa. (HOWLING)

02:39.617 --> 02:41.911
-From the phone call?
-DUG: She was mean on the phone.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.039
-She likes me.
-DUG: And she likes you? Huh?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.541
And wants to go out on a date.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.668
With me!

02:48.751 --> 02:51.129
And I said okay.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.213
Can you believe it?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.923
DUG: I do not know these words.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.092
How could I do such a thing? (GASPS)

02:58.011 --> 02:59.095
I'm sorry, Ellie.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.723
DUG: Poppa, what is a date?

03:01.806 --> 03:05.018
Well, we go out.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.520
You know, hold hands, pitch woo.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.646
Woo?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.232
Like, playing at the dog park with Fifi.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.734
DUG: Oh!

03:12.817 --> 03:14.569
I don't know how to date.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.822
DUG: Since you are my Poppa,
may I call her my momma?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.657
Please refrain.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.492
Do I shake her hand when I see her?

03:21.659 --> 03:23.203
What do I do?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.662
DUG: Just smell her backward side.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.830
What?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.207
DUG: Smell her backward side.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.043
Then she will do the same.
It is how you say hello.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.628
Disgusting!

03:31.711 --> 03:32.837
I'm a person, you know?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.799
DUG: Oh, I am just a dawg.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.510
All right, I'll think about it.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.846
-DUG: No. That is fine.
-Dug!

03:41.930 --> 03:44.224
DUG:
Humans should be more like a dawg.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.059
Well, what would a dog do?

03:46.142 --> 03:47.685
DUG: I would bring her a toy.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.395
She would wag her tail.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.147
Mmm-hmm.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.067
Okay. Okay.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.235
Yeah, okay!

03:55.318 --> 03:56.569
I gotta go to the store.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.242
(GROANS)

04:03.868 --> 04:04.911
Wallet.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.249
Ah, phooey.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.417
Keys.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.172
Aw! Other way.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.385
DUG: I think Poppa needs to go to the vet.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.429

04:23.513 --> 04:24.639
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

04:24.722 --> 04:25.807
Poppa is back.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.642
Poppa?

04:28.476 --> 04:30.228
Uh, Poppa?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.402
They're, uh, fun, right?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.778
DUG: Uh...

04:39.862 --> 04:41.239
I am a dawg.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.950
Fun is digging in the dirt
and destroying your flowers.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.702
(GASPS) Flowers!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.537
There's so much to do.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.163
DUG: This is not fun at all.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.750
DUG: Oh! Too much smell!

04:52.834 --> 04:54.669
What? It's a cologne.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.379
DUG: It made my nose get dead.

One, two, three. Two, two, three.

-DUG: I have no idea what is happening.
-One, two, three.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.855
Oh, yes. The economy is on the rise, yeah.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.982
-Would you agree?
-DUG: And what do I say?

05:16.065 --> 05:17.108
Anything!

05:17.191 --> 05:20.028
A new town swimming pool?
Great idea.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.154
DUG: I like bugs.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.823
Yes, it does look like
a cold front is coming in.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.241

You are so witty. (LAUGHS)

(EXCLAIMS)

05:47.555 --> 05:48.598
Is it too much?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.516
DUG: You do not look like you.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.768
I know.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.561
DUG: You do not smell like you.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.729
Yeah.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.190
DUG: Why are you not you?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.735
This is crazy. I'm not going.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.071
-DUG: No. I will not let you!
-Yes. I must.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.197
Why do you care?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.074
DUG: I do not want you to be sad!

06:08.576 --> 06:09.577
Sit, Poppa!

06:09.786 --> 06:10.828
(GRUNTS)

06:11.746 --> 06:14.540
You will act like a dawg, not a human.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.959
You will bring her a toy
and when you see her,

06:17.043 --> 06:18.252
you wag your tail,

06:18.336 --> 06:20.880
and say,
"I have just met you and I love you!"

06:21.547 --> 06:24.258
You are my Poppa, and I love you,

06:24.342 --> 06:25.760
and she will love you.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.139
(SIGHS)

06:31.808 --> 06:32.809
Thanks, Dug.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.195
This is it.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.133
I will go, too.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.471
One more thing.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.976
Hope you don't mind, Ellie.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.354
I guess this is a new kind
of adventure for both of us.

07:19.230 --> 07:23.985
I promise I'll be back by 10:00.
11:00, at the latest.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.987
Dug is my chaperone.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.947
He won't let me pitch any woo.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.825
And...

07:31.993 --> 07:33.411
Just know...

07:33.494 --> 07:35.663
You'll always be my girl.
