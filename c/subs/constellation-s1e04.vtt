WEBVTT

00:23.815 --> 00:25.108
Are we nearly there?

00:26.985 --> 00:28.654
I've got wet socks.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.156
It must be minus 50.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.038
Daddy?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.208
Yeah?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.418
What do we do now?

00:49.675 --> 00:50.801
Hot chocolate?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.470
I mean, where do we live?

00:55.514 --> 00:56.515
Well,

00:57.641 --> 00:58.892
we could go back to England.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.813
We could stay here in Sweden.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.441
We could go anywhere, really.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.028
I mean, we don't have any...

01:27.838 --> 01:29.840
You remember the last time we were here?

01:31.008 --> 01:34.261
That was the last summer with Mamma.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.397
I'm nervous.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.525
Well, she's not gonna be here.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.860
You know that, right?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.071
We're not gonna see her again.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.456
Merry delayed Christmas
and happy delayed birthday!

02:46.708 --> 02:48.544
Oh, my God.

02:48.544 --> 02:53.215
Okay. "The Spanish fireman
has two sons. What are they called?"

02:55.717 --> 02:58.720
"Jose and Hose B."

03:00.722 --> 03:02.474
That's pretty good.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.809
What?

03:03.809 --> 03:05.477
That was crap.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.188
You know, they're supposed to be crap.
That's the point.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.356
You say one.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.315
Oh, no.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.525
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You do one.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.490
Okay.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.325
Okay, I got one.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.537
It's sort of similar to that one.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.206
- But it's kind of Swedish though.
- I'm married to a Swede. Go ahead.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.376
Okay, so, Nelson Mandela
has a Swedish half-brother.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.752
Who's Nelson Mandela?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.214
It's not gonna work
if you don't know who Nelson Mandela is.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.465
I know who he was.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.137
Okay, so Nelson Mandela has
a Swedish half-brother called...

03:42.890 --> 03:44.600
<i>MÃ¥ste ManDela.</i>

03:51.273 --> 03:54.902
It's really funny in Swedish.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.744
You changed around the cupboards.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
No, I'm not really
a move-the-cupboards-around kind of guy.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.669
Jo, can we have a talk?

04:14.213 --> 04:15.380
Yeah, of course.

04:16.380 --> 04:21.512
It's just-- We didn't really leave things
in a very satisfactory way when you went.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.516
How did we leave things?

04:27.935 --> 04:33.065
Well, you didn't look at me
when we said goodbye.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.317
Of course I did.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.195
No. You didn't.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.366
I've thought about it a lot the last year.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.703
I don't know if you noticed,
but it was a really appalling few months.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.208
For me, at least. Before you went away.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.336
I'm sorry.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.797
That's not how I remember it.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.341
I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.679
Do you love me?

05:06.348 --> 05:07.599
But of course I do.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.811
I'm not being needy.
It's a genuine question.

05:21.363 --> 05:25.242
Of course I love you, you big idiot.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.934
- Hello.
- Welcome back, ma'am.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.018
Thank you.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.343
What about this one?

07:48.343 --> 07:50.387
"How the Sand Got to the Sea".

07:50.387 --> 07:52.681
Do you want to toss it or keep it?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.395
You don't understand me, do you?

08:00.022 --> 08:02.858
I was just asking
if you wanted to keep it or toss it.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.067
Toss it.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.152
Gone.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.532
<i>The Changeling.</i>

08:12.534 --> 08:13.493
Yeah.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.622
The one when the trolls take the baby.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.335
And they put the baby in the fire
to bring the mamma back.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.588
Yeah.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.557
Was there anything specific
that upset you before I left?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.227
We don't have to talk about it.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.022
Is the Allen key anywhere?

08:43.690 --> 08:44.691
Yeah.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.529
- It's this one, right?
- Yeah.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.119
We hardly saw you.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.082
I mean, obviously there was that washout
of a summer up at the cabin,

09:01.124 --> 09:02.543
but you were away training.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.211
A lot.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.630
So, there wasn't, like,
one specific thing?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.965
You know, there is gonna come a day

09:07.965 --> 09:11.051
when I have assembled
my last piece of shitty furniture

09:11.051 --> 09:13.428
and I am not gonna have to do this again.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.601
Magnus, what?

09:22.771 --> 09:25.732
I'm not a jealous person.
I hope you know that.

09:27.025 --> 09:31.363
But I had really started to wonder
about you and Frederic.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.282
What?

09:34.825 --> 09:35.951
No.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.704
Absolutely not. No.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.998
Look, things are
going really well with us.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.624
- Yeah.
- So this would be a good time

09:42.624 --> 09:43.834
to level with me.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.880
But, Magnus,
I didn't have an affair with Frederic.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.216
I would never do something like that.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.011
- Right.
- Magnus, please.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.347
I just want us to be honest
with each other.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.432
Yeah.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.352
Jo, while you were gone...

10:04.980 --> 10:06.440
I kind of met someone.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.859
What?

10:09.818 --> 10:11.778
I mean, nothing happened really.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.616
But, we went for a drink.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.620
One kiss.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.704
What?

10:21.914 --> 10:23.707
I thought you were leaving me, Jo.

10:25.792 --> 10:30.297
You know, there was a lot--
a lot of gossip about you and Frederic.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.966
I assumed you'd come back,
and we'd be done.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.259
But why?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.554
- Like--
- Just trying to level with you.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.766
Yeah. I want you to be my husband, okay?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.477
I want Alice to be my daughter.

10:44.478 --> 10:48.273
When I was up there, the only thing
I could focus on was getting home

10:48.273 --> 10:51.151
and assembling shitty furniture.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.655
When I was up there, all alone,
and no one could hear me,

10:54.655 --> 10:56.990
and I thought I was gonna die.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.992
Daddy?

10:59.701 --> 11:02.287
Daddy. Come.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.206
Magnus...

11:08.126 --> 11:10.838
I really grieve the time I've lost
with you and her.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.299
I couldn't cope if...

11:16.343 --> 11:17.469
Daddy?

11:19.221 --> 11:20.264
Go.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.016
Sorry.

12:51.855 --> 12:52.981
Mr. Rogers?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.445
- Mr. Rogers?
- Just a second.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.704
- Is he--
- Bud,

13:07.704 --> 13:10.624
all speakers are supposed to go
to the main hall. Emergency briefing.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.584
Yeah, I just wanted to say--

13:16.171 --> 13:17.673
<i>Attention, please.</i>

13:17.673 --> 13:20.968
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.</i>

13:21.677 --> 13:24.638
<i>We are turning
and making a call in Santa Barbara.</i>

13:25.264 --> 13:30.060
<i>It looks like there was an incident
with one of our guests overnight.</i>

13:31.353 --> 13:35.065
<i>We have to complete a few necessary
safeguards and procedures.</i>

13:36.233 --> 13:38.569
<i>We will be asking you to stay on board,</i>

13:38.569 --> 13:41.780
<i>and we hope this won't
inconvenience you too badly.</i>

13:48.203 --> 13:51.164
<i>Henry, you are funded by NASA,
and you are a NASA employee.</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:54.168
And have been since long before
you were born, Michaela.

13:54.168 --> 13:57.045
<i>We need to talk about the fact
that no permission is granted to you</i>

13:57.045 --> 13:59.548
<i>to go to another space agency
with RPL equipment.</i>

13:59.548 --> 14:01.633
The CAL is mine.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.011
<i>It didn't work, Henry.</i>

14:04.011 --> 14:05.554
No, please don't say that.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.140
<i>I know. It's very tough to let go.</i>

14:08.140 --> 14:10.309
Yeah, well, this is not
what failure looks like.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.102
I just need to think it through.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.729
It's having an effect.

14:13.729 --> 14:16.190
<i>You need to come home, okay?</i>

14:16.190 --> 14:18.442
<i>You've had ten days
with a lot of assistance</i>

14:18.442 --> 14:21.987
<i>and there's no evidence the CAL worked.
We're shutting it down.</i>

14:22.696 --> 14:24.323
<i>This is the end of the project.</i>

14:26.408 --> 14:27.576
<i>Henry--</i>

14:38.003 --> 14:39.588
<i>I misremember things.</i>

14:39.588 --> 14:40.797
Such as?

14:42.758 --> 14:46.220
Where things are. My car.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.222
Okay.

14:48.222 --> 14:52.226
I remember it as red, but it's blue.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.603
It's a small thing, but...

14:55.437 --> 14:57.272
Actually, it's quite a big thing.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.487
I think-- I think I...

15:10.327 --> 15:14.414
I have a piano in my house,
and I don't play the piano.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.460
Do you have hallucinations?

15:20.754 --> 15:21.755
Yeah.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.132
What kind?

15:26.760 --> 15:29.847
I see Paul Lancaster.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.558
I mean, I--

15:33.976 --> 15:35.602
His ghost, I suppose.

15:35.602 --> 15:40.399
Sometimes it feels like
I'm still up there on the ISS.

15:41.859 --> 15:45.571
What you are telling me
seems highly symptomatic of PTSD,

15:45.571 --> 15:50.993
where you would expect replays
of stressful events, memory lapses, anger.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.287
It's not surprising
you would have this condition.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.038
You were in fear of your life,

15:55.038 --> 15:56.999
very concerned about your crew,
your family.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.794
Dealing with the death of a friend,
you've been through huge trauma.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.548
Now you're back to Earth,
and this can be where it hits you.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.470
Listen, we'll try you with
a dexamethasone-suppression test

16:10.470 --> 16:12.556
and see what your cortisol levels are.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.601
And in the meantime,
I can give you something.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.810
Such as?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.604
Lithium.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.899
Jenny, I'm not psychotic.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.526
I'm not depressed.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.862
No, but it'll calm you.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.531
It calms these things.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.966
I don't want this. I don't--

16:51.762 --> 16:53.764
This kind of stuff is career-ending.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.071
I'm interested in
the research you're doing.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.699
What's it called, "salutogenesis"?

17:13.784 --> 17:15.661
- I--
- How do you define it?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.205
I didn't know you were here.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.083
I'm here.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.295
Think it's a better place for me to be.
I think I can help.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.297
So how is it going for you?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.341
With the CAL, you mean?

17:29.341 --> 17:31.718
Well, I keep running it and running it.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.720
I think I may be on the edge of something.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.680
Uh-huh.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.225
I don't remember much about
the CAL before the accident, I...

17:39.351 --> 17:40.727
- I--
- Would you like to see it?

17:43.397 --> 17:46.191
I'm not getting a hell of a lot of stuff
I understand.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.072
Have you heard much anecdotal evidence
from astronauts?

17:52.573 --> 17:54.950
How it affects them? It's not all good.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.745
I know some felt burned out.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.080
Oh, yeah.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.457
People find it tough.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.459
Go through things they don't understand.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.295
Yeah.

18:06.295 --> 18:09.173
I have a couple of friends--
<i>Gemini IV</i> crew--

18:09.173 --> 18:10.924
Chuck Parks, John Cooper...

18:12.217 --> 18:15.304
They smelled burning toast up there.
Both of them.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.140
John heard a dog barking.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.642
Always said it was Laika.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.979
You know, I wonder how Laika felt.

18:25.439 --> 18:26.648
You a dog person?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.196
...ish.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.991
It's always been the case
since we started flying high altitude.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.453
I was a test pilot, pre-Apollo.

18:39.953 --> 18:44.124
Flying the highest altitudes you can,
right up to the edge of space.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.253
It was pretty common back then
for colleagues to report a powerful force

18:48.253 --> 18:52.674
pressing down on one of the wings
of the aircraft above 90,000 feet.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.594
They called it "the left hand of God."

18:56.470 --> 18:57.596
I knew this guy.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.515
Lost his son.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.935
Little boy, six years old,

19:04.311 --> 19:07.064
drowned in a lake
on his baby sister's birthday.

19:07.731 --> 19:12.152
This guy, a couple years later,
flying <i>DC-10s</i> over Nevada,

19:13.987 --> 19:15.239
heard a voice.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.407
A child's voice.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.368
His son's voice.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.204
"Daddy, watch out."

19:23.330 --> 19:26.750
Noticed that he'd plunged into a dive,
managed to pull out.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.879
Till the end of his life,
he swore his son saved him.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.050
They don't say it,

19:36.260 --> 19:39.221
but that's the kind of thing
that followed us into space.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.019
You ever seen anything that wasn't there?

19:48.230 --> 19:50.482
Like climbing Everest, going into space.

19:51.108 --> 19:54.027
Your whole focus is on the summit.
And if you're not very careful,

19:54.027 --> 19:57.531
you can forget that once you've summited,
you have to get back down.

19:59.283 --> 20:01.410
That's when people come unstuck.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.747
I have to check this. It's running again.

21:06.808 --> 21:07.893
- <i>Hi.</i>
- It's Papa.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.394
<i>I can't talk.</i>

21:09.394 --> 21:10.562
It's not working.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.689
<i>Oh, God.</i>

21:12.689 --> 21:14.775
There were a few good years but--

21:14.775 --> 21:17.361
Christ, I need to find a way around it.

21:17.361 --> 21:19.863
I gotta find a way to get
to that motherfucker.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.700
<i>Papa, you gotta stop thinking
like all this stuff is outside of you.</i>

21:23.700 --> 21:25.160
Connie, it's not an illness.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.288
<i>It is an illness.
No one fucked with your brain.</i>

21:28.288 --> 21:30.999
<i>It's you. It's something you can control.</i>

21:30.999 --> 21:34.211
<i>Look, if you're having an episode,
please just take your pills.</i>

21:34.920 --> 21:36.463
<i>Like I said, I can't talk.</i>

22:13.750 --> 22:16.879
She speaks about death and accidents.

22:16.879 --> 22:20.674
- And there's this cupboards issue.
- What do you mean?

22:20.674 --> 22:22.968
- She hides in cupboards. Yeah.
- She hides in cupboards.

22:26.388 --> 22:30.517
It strikes me that maybe you're a system
that has lost each other a bit.

22:31.018 --> 22:33.812
She's ten. She was nine when you left.

22:33.812 --> 22:37.482
That's a long year.
It's a very liminal age.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.193
What do you mean with "liminal"?

22:40.402 --> 22:41.987
Between one thing and another.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.363
Yes. Exactly.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.328
She wants to change things, like her room.

22:49.328 --> 22:53.665
And for a year, you've had the father
and the daughter, and so Mom is...

22:54.166 --> 22:55.918
Mom's been too far apart.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.586
She was in space.

22:57.586 --> 23:00.672
And now she's come back,
and maybe Alice isn't sure.

23:00.672 --> 23:04.176
Maybe she's haunted
by her feelings of, "Mom is--

23:04.176 --> 23:05.636
Well,

23:05.636 --> 23:07.262
"Who-who are you?

23:08.472 --> 23:09.806
Can I trust you?"

23:12.476 --> 23:15.562
What have you told her?
She knows things that are private.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.941
She's my colleague and Alice's teacher.

23:20.943 --> 23:21.944
What did Jenny say?

23:24.321 --> 23:26.740
Jenny said that I have PTSD.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.785
There's nothing to worry about. I'm fine.

23:29.785 --> 23:31.161
Don't tell anyone.

23:31.912 --> 23:35.207
Do you think something is wrong
with my attachment to Alice?

23:36.917 --> 23:38.252
- No.
- No?

23:38.794 --> 23:40.254
Well, of course there is.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.923
I've been away for a year.

23:43.674 --> 23:46.301
"Who are you? Can I trust you?"

23:46.301 --> 23:50.222
- She didn't say Alice couldn't trust you.
- You just sat there agreeing with her.

23:55.644 --> 23:56.687
Alice?

23:57.604 --> 23:59.022
Try the spare room.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.404
Alice?

24:09.241 --> 24:10.576
Are you here?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.000
Fuck.

24:20.377 --> 24:21.378
Alice?

24:26.925 --> 24:28.343
Alice, get out of there.

24:30.679 --> 24:31.680
Alice, now.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.186
What?

24:37.186 --> 24:39.646
I got some old clothes
that you might like.

24:40.772 --> 24:41.940
Okay.

24:42.733 --> 24:45.360
Baby. Come.

24:52.993 --> 24:56.163
We haven't really had
enough Mamma-Alice time.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.541
Maybe we could go away somewhere.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.376
Just us?

25:02.544 --> 25:04.671
Well, no. Daddy, of course, too.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.966
We could go to the cabin.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.301
What about school though?

25:11.094 --> 25:12.763
School have had you for a whole year.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.265
Alice.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.520
Baby, don't shut me out.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.604
I'm not.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.319
You're not happy I'm back?

25:30.739 --> 25:31.823
I don't know.

25:35.244 --> 25:37.287
I'm just a little bit disappointed.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.587
I thought it would be different.

25:47.297 --> 25:52.052
At the center of the CAL is a chamber
containing a gas of rubidium atoms.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.389
Around it is an arrangement of lasers, electromagnets.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.641
- A magnetic trap.
- <i>Understood.</i>

25:57.641 --> 26:02.229
To achieve the condensate,
the laser is turned to resonate the atoms.

26:02.229 --> 26:07.484
Then, when the laser is turned off,
that's when the superposition is formed.

26:08.485 --> 26:09.403
<i>You formed it?</i>

26:09.403 --> 26:13.991
A black blob-- Two black blobs alongside.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.333
This is the image we got on board the ISS.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.670
<i>There's an interference effect, Henry.</i>

26:27.254 --> 26:29.506
<i>There can't be an interference effect.</i>

26:30.340 --> 26:32.426
<i>What's the data now?</i>

26:35.888 --> 26:37.764
- Here.
- <i>What is this?</i>

26:37.764 --> 26:40.309
<i>It looks like a child's picture
of an owl or something.</i>

26:40.893 --> 26:42.352
It doesn't wanna be seen.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.604
<i>What?</i>

26:43.604 --> 26:45.397
But trust me, when I've run it down here--

26:45.397 --> 26:46.732
<i>When you've run it down here?</i>

26:46.732 --> 26:48.066
That's what I see.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.276
<i>Then show me the data.</i>

26:49.276 --> 26:51.320
This is the data. I can't, Louis.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.949
It's there, clear as day inside the halo,
but it's just me who sees it.

26:55.949 --> 26:59.578
<i>Henry, I'm sorry. You can't have built
a pathway to another universe.</i>

26:59.578 --> 27:02.122
<i>What you saw
from the ISS was a false image.</i>

27:02.122 --> 27:06.376
No. The CAL experiment was
meant to capture a state

27:06.376 --> 27:10.380
in which one particle is
in two different states at the same time.

27:11.173 --> 27:13.133
And we did it.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.011
<i>Henry, an experiment went wrong,</i>

27:16.011 --> 27:18.180
<i>and you got a false image.</i>

27:18.180 --> 27:19.556
<i>But you can always run it again.</i>

27:19.556 --> 27:22.559
No, sir,
I cannot goddamn well run it again

27:22.559 --> 27:24.436
'cause we're never going back up there.

27:25.395 --> 27:30.192
Listen, Louis, what if
the result of the experiment

27:30.192 --> 27:34.613
could theoretically make themselves
visible in different ways?

27:34.613 --> 27:35.948
<i>Like?</i>

27:35.948 --> 27:37.282
Not on a screen.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.785
In the mind of an observer.

27:41.203 --> 27:42.996
Of what you see in the world around you.

27:42.996 --> 27:47.626
What if it works
on the chemistry of the brain?

27:47.626 --> 27:48.710
<i>Come on.</i>

27:48.710 --> 27:53.298
The whole history of quantum physics
is bound up with the observer effect,

27:53.298 --> 27:57.761
the effect that looking at something has
upon the experiment.

27:58.345 --> 28:02.724
What if the experiment
is having an effect on me?

30:48.849 --> 30:53.395
It has to hurt, right?
When someone doesn't believe you.

30:54.438 --> 30:55.856
Agent Bright, FBI.

31:02.321 --> 31:06.074
You know what we're discussing here
is a psychological illness

31:06.074 --> 31:09.786
in which these people
can't see reality as it is.

31:10.454 --> 31:12.539
Now, it might have passed you by,
Agent Bright,

31:13.040 --> 31:14.875
but truth is a rare commodity.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.586
Has that passed you by in law enforcement?

31:18.170 --> 31:19.046
No.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.298
I was on the moon.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.091
I walked there.

31:23.634 --> 31:25.677
There's proof. I left a golf ball.

31:25.677 --> 31:28.514
No one is doubting
that you walked on the moon.

31:28.514 --> 31:30.641
We just wanna know what happened
to this man on the ship.

31:30.641 --> 31:32.851
You came and interrupted him at dinner.

31:32.851 --> 31:35.646
Yeah, to talk to him. Make him see sense.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.525
They're gonna drop me off
in Santa Barbara, okay?

31:39.525 --> 31:40.609
You said something like,

31:40.609 --> 31:44.530
if Mr. Rogers were to tussle with you,
you would throw him in the damn sea.

31:44.530 --> 31:49.326
No, Agent Bright, I haven't been able
to lift this shoulder past 45 degrees

31:49.326 --> 31:51.745
since I crashed my plane in Korea.

31:52.329 --> 31:54.289
And even if I could, I wouldn't.

31:55.207 --> 31:56.708
I'm an astronaut.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.045
The right stuff.

33:09.448 --> 33:10.741
What are you doing?

33:11.742 --> 33:13.619
I'm an autonomous human being.

33:13.619 --> 33:16.663
I don't need anyone's permission
to be anywhere.

33:18.457 --> 33:21.710
Goddamn it, I want us to agree
on what's causing this.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.505
Convince me that I am not going insane.

35:20.495 --> 35:23.165
"Ilya. Vitamins A."

35:23.749 --> 35:26.502
"Audrey. Vitamins A."

35:27.252 --> 35:29.254
"Yaz. Vitamins A."

35:32.090 --> 35:33.300
"Vitamins B."

35:35.093 --> 35:36.470
Oh, okay.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.724
"Amanda Klein."

35:43.644 --> 35:44.978
"Vitamins B."

35:47.523 --> 35:51.151
"NASA astronaut Amanda Klein
saw angels in space."

35:54.863 --> 35:55.697
Come on.

35:57.783 --> 35:59.868
"Canadian astronaut on trial.

35:59.868 --> 36:04.665
Assumed false identity before attempting
murder on ex-husband, new family."

36:08.669 --> 36:11.129
"Caldera, Henry."

36:23.350 --> 36:24.351
What are you doing?

36:38.991 --> 36:40.284
Guys, stop it!

36:44.663 --> 36:45.664
Hello?

36:54.089 --> 36:55.090
Hello?

37:17.404 --> 37:20.532
Whatever I do here with my own time

37:20.532 --> 37:25.162
and my own life is a matter only for me.

37:26.330 --> 37:27.664
Excuse me, Henry.

37:31.126 --> 37:35.923
If you hadn't been so fucking curious,
none of this would have been an issue.

37:42.638 --> 37:43.680
Are you okay, Henry?

37:45.516 --> 37:46.808
Commander Caldera?

37:52.272 --> 37:54.358
Curiosity killed the cat.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.654
- Jo?
- Yeah.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.869
We both had a lot of time
to think about things...

38:49.204 --> 38:51.290
and no time to talk.

38:52.916 --> 38:53.917
About what?

38:54.501 --> 38:56.044
Obviously something's changed,

38:56.044 --> 38:59.506
and I'm sorry if I said things
that were inappropriate.

39:01.175 --> 39:04.428
But I want you, Jo,
just as much as before.

39:05.262 --> 39:08.891
I want us to serve out the contracts here
and go private, like we said.

39:09.641 --> 39:12.978
I've been talking to them.
StarCosm, Alyanna.

39:13.562 --> 39:14.563
They like it.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.982
Especially if it's the two of us
as a package.

39:18.233 --> 39:19.443
California.

39:21.570 --> 39:23.071
I don't know what you are talking about.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.198
Jo, look.

39:27.117 --> 39:29.786
I think you owe it to me
to tell me if you've changed your mind.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.166
Have you changed your mind?

39:38.587 --> 39:43.091
There's a lot of weird differences
between Earth and space,

39:43.091 --> 39:45.052
and it's not just the gravity.

39:47.971 --> 39:51.225
Time passes at a different speed
on Earth and in space.

39:52.142 --> 39:53.769
So after six months in space,

39:53.769 --> 40:00.609
an astronaut have aged 0.007 seconds less
than a person who remains on Earth.

40:01.109 --> 40:02.569
What happens to it?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.447
- Do you, like, understand anything?
- To what?

40:05.447 --> 40:07.157
Where do the 0.7 seconds go?

40:08.033 --> 40:09.034
Is it you?

40:10.994 --> 40:13.247
- Huh?
- Yeah, I'm talking to you.

40:14.665 --> 40:16.041
Is it her, Magnus?

40:18.043 --> 40:19.044
What's happening?

40:20.170 --> 40:21.505
Is it her?

40:23.382 --> 40:24.466
Come on, Jo.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.678
- I'm sorry, Sara.
-"I'm sorry, Sara."

40:30.681 --> 40:33.267
- Jo.
- Leave my husband alone, okay?

40:47.573 --> 40:48.866
What the hell was that?

40:50.576 --> 40:51.743
Give me the keys.

40:57.332 --> 40:58.625
This is ridiculous.

41:00.794 --> 41:02.963
You're not supposed to drive
for a couple of weeks.

41:04.089 --> 41:05.757
I know how to drive a fucking car.

41:05.757 --> 41:08.427
Don't swear in front of our daughter.
You're acting like the town drunk.

41:18.854 --> 41:19.980
Can we put on a song?

41:20.564 --> 41:22.608
I have to concentrate a bit.

41:28.238 --> 41:30.782
Alice, I need to concentrate, okay?

41:35.412 --> 41:38.332
Alice, turn it off. Turn it off, Alice!

41:38.332 --> 41:40.709
- Alice, for Christ's sake!
- Mom!

41:55.349 --> 41:58.644
The various space agencies have
rehab clinics for astronauts who...

42:00.854 --> 42:03.482
There's a condition
called astronaut burnout.

42:03.482 --> 42:05.025
For God's sake, she's just come back.

42:05.025 --> 42:07.486
- I can't have her going away again.
- She's got a problem.

42:07.486 --> 42:10.906
It's obviously a reaction
to the stress of what went on in space.

42:10.906 --> 42:15.244
And, without an intervention,
she'll get worse.

42:18.497 --> 42:19.957
And are you going with her?

42:22.334 --> 42:23.418
Don't know.

42:24.127 --> 42:26.088
Yeah, maybe. To begin with.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.842
Did you have an affair with her?

42:35.639 --> 42:37.724
- What did she say?
- Never mind what she said.

42:38.225 --> 42:39.226
Did you?

42:42.062 --> 42:43.063
Yes.

42:51.864 --> 42:53.699
- What's this?
- Magnus asked me here

42:54.366 --> 42:55.993
because he's concerned about you.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.370
You lied to me.

42:58.370 --> 42:59.621
What?

42:59.621 --> 43:03.250
He's concerned because you're behaving
in quite a-- dissociated way.

43:03.250 --> 43:06.628
I can speak for myself, you piece of shit.

43:06.628 --> 43:08.297
What have you said to him?

43:08.297 --> 43:09.631
I told him the truth.

43:15.554 --> 43:20.559
I hon-- Honestly, I--
I didn't remember. I-I didn't--

43:20.559 --> 43:22.895
How the fuck do you forget
something like that?

43:22.895 --> 43:24.813
Clearly there's some memory issues
going on.

43:24.813 --> 43:25.731
Fuck off!

43:25.731 --> 43:28.108
If you're having these symptoms, Jo,

43:28.108 --> 43:30.444
we can easily get you
the appropriate help.

43:30.444 --> 43:32.029
I need to talk to my husband.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.531
Get the fuck out of my house.

43:35.365 --> 43:36.491
Go!

43:36.491 --> 43:37.868
I'm not crazy.

43:37.868 --> 43:39.828
Frederic, I work for you.

43:40.454 --> 43:41.830
This is my home.

43:41.830 --> 43:44.166
You don't belong here. I'm not at work.

43:46.752 --> 43:48.128
Fine.

43:49.087 --> 43:50.088
Fine.

43:52.549 --> 43:54.051
We'll go through HR tomorrow.

43:55.928 --> 43:58.972
It's good to have all this
out in the open though.

44:05.646 --> 44:06.813
I didn't lie to you.

44:06.813 --> 44:10.275
I am not a fucking fool.

44:10.984 --> 44:12.653
I didn't remember.

44:13.278 --> 44:15.531
I don't remember. I don't remember!

44:17.783 --> 44:20.452
Maybe this isn't
the same fucking place that I left.

44:20.452 --> 44:22.538
It's exactly the same, Jo!

44:23.956 --> 44:25.582
It's you that's different.

44:25.582 --> 44:27.084
Daddy!

44:27.084 --> 44:29.419
Wait. Magnus! Hey, Magnus--

44:29.419 --> 44:32.840
Why don't you try taking care
of your child for a change?

44:37.928 --> 44:39.012
Fuck!

44:57.531 --> 45:00.367

45:35.944 --> 45:37.404

48:27.783 --> 48:28.825
Mummy?

48:55.310 --> 48:58.772
- Alice? What is it? Alice?
- It's me!

48:58.772 --> 49:00.399
Wha-- What are you seeing?

49:00.399 --> 49:01.900
You're dead.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.777
- Don't wake her up.
- She's awake.

49:03.777 --> 49:07.322
- It's Wendy's dad.
- What? Paul?

49:07.322 --> 49:08.699
For God's sake, Jo, just leave it.

49:08.699 --> 49:10.409
- I want to go.
- Come here.

49:10.409 --> 49:12.452
- Wait, no. Put her down.
- Come here. Come on.

49:12.452 --> 49:14.872
Magnus. Where you taking her?

49:17.040 --> 49:18.542
Don't put her in a cupboard!

49:19.710 --> 49:22.212
- Don't put her in the fucking cupboard!
- I want to.

49:22.713 --> 49:24.173
How is that gonna make things better?

49:24.173 --> 49:25.549
I want Daddy to tuck me in.

49:26.341 --> 49:30.179
- Don't put her in the fucking cupboard!
- She's scared of you, Jo. Okay?

49:30.179 --> 49:31.471
You're scaring her.

49:32.014 --> 49:34.183
Just go away. Go downstairs.

49:42.191 --> 49:43.192
You okay, baby?

49:52.576 --> 49:54.244
I mean, what were you doing?

49:56.622 --> 49:58.999
Why are you putting her in the cupboard?

49:58.999 --> 50:00.959
She's scared. She wants to hide.

50:00.959 --> 50:02.377
How long has she been scared?

50:02.961 --> 50:04.004
How long do you think?

50:05.380 --> 50:07.799
Take the pills that Jenny gave you.

50:07.799 --> 50:09.134
You know what?

50:09.134 --> 50:13.722
- Those pills, they are antipsychotics.
- Of course they are. That's the point.

50:13.722 --> 50:16.183
No, no, no, wait. I mean, both are.

50:16.183 --> 50:18.894
The vitamins and-- Both sets, they--

50:18.894 --> 50:22.814
There's a concerted effort to get me
on antipsychotic medication.

50:23.315 --> 50:25.651
They want to deny what I saw up there.

50:25.651 --> 50:27.903
Just take the fucking pills, Jo.

50:29.488 --> 50:30.489
What are you doing?

50:30.489 --> 50:33.158
I'm gonna call Frederic back
because he's actually right.

50:33.158 --> 50:34.868
No, I need to sort this out.

50:35.410 --> 50:36.870
And you need to help me.

50:37.746 --> 50:39.706
I need to work out why they're doing this.

50:39.706 --> 50:42.084
I am helping you, Jo.

50:44.336 --> 50:46.171
Why are you calling Frederic?

50:46.171 --> 50:48.966
I was the one that was
supposedly fucking him.

50:48.966 --> 50:50.050
Don't!

50:51.343 --> 50:54.471
I know you could all hear me
when I was up there.

50:55.013 --> 50:58.141
When I was up there and I was trying
to get back home and I was afraid,

50:58.141 --> 51:01.061
you could all hear me.
I heard those tapes.

51:01.061 --> 51:03.397
And you were gonna leave me
up there to die.

51:03.397 --> 51:04.314
Jo.

51:04.314 --> 51:05.983
- Put the phone down.
- I'm sorry.

51:05.983 --> 51:07.359
Put the fucking phone down.

51:07.359 --> 51:09.570
- I will-- I will still be here!
- Put--

51:17.494 --> 51:19.788
Magnus?
