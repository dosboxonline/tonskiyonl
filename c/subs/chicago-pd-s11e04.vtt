Grandmother was home.

- Huh.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.476

to a non-existent address.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.400

He's working for a major DTO.
Any idea who?

All we got is PODs

for Rafael Perez?

04:22.887 --> 04:24.222
- Yes, sir.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.099
PODs show Trey's vehicle
all over Perez's territory.

OCD also confirmed that he's
a known associate of Perez.

for, what, six years?

04:36.192 --> 04:38.236
Never been close
to making a case.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.696
They can't build
their way up to him.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.197
- Guy works alone or in person.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.490
Always uses a burner.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.034
He has a very tight,
loyal crew.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.535
- Looks like they're
all younger or family.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.745
No one's ever flipped on him.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.455

keeps a low profile.

The man's on lock.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.509

According to his credit report,

05:03.011 --> 05:04.721
Trey worked at Ultra Motors,

05:04.763 --> 05:07.724

Eric Medina.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.559
- Perez is selling
his dope from there.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.894
- And he just lost a runner.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.103
- Hmm.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.438

05:49.766 --> 05:51.309
- Oh, no, I'm not--
I'm not selling.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.353
I was hoping to lend
one of your lifts

05:53.395 --> 05:54.729
so I can fix my transmission.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.899
- I only let employees
use my lifts.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.776
- Hey, look,
I'm good in garages.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.820
You can ask my boy, Trey.
He works here.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.196
- You know Trey?

06:03.238 --> 06:06.116
- Yeah, since kindergarten.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.951
- You didn't hear?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.077
- What?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.954
- He died yesterday.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.122
Bad car wreck.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.624
- What?

06:14.666 --> 06:16.751
What the hell happened?
Was he--

06:18.086 --> 06:19.004
Was he running?

06:22.132 --> 06:23.675
We used to run together, bro.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.802
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.037
What the hell?
Give me your license.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.789
If it checks out,
you can use the lift,

06:54.831 --> 06:57.876
but you're paying by the hour,
only using when we're closed.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.169

That answer right?

13:15.712 --> 13:17.922
[Ruzek sighs]

13:19.299 --> 13:21.259
- [inaudible]

13:21.301 --> 13:27.390
* *

13:46.451 --> 13:46.826
.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.118
- Yo.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.082
You wanted me here at 9:00.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.416
[chuckling] It's 9:00.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.211
- [sighs] Okay.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.463
Yeah. Gold star.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.256
Just don't yell, bro.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.552
Since police got Trey's stash,
we got no good dope.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.680
Dude lost six bricks.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.806
We're running stepped-on skag

14:07.847 --> 14:09.683
till our next shipment
comes in.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.059
- When's that?
[faucet running]

14:11.101 --> 14:13.436
- Mm, couple days.
[sighs]

14:13.478 --> 14:16.106
Skunk's wack, but we
gotta move it the same.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.440
- Am I gonna be
moving the new shipment?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.109
- Hell, no.
You're starting small.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.527
[metallic clattering]

14:20.568 --> 14:23.697
[speaking Spanish]

14:23.738 --> 14:25.782
Just moving what we got now.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.159
Oh, Jesus.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.871
Ugh, it's so bright.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.793
[sighs]

14:36.835 --> 14:38.545
All right, so first up
is a car switch.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.588
Car plates and address
are in the glove box.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.092
Leave this car at the address,
pick up the other car.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.885
Should be real easy.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.765
Hey.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.767
Spring coils sound shot again.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.770
- Hey.
Don't you ever touch my car.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.522
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.649
- Yo, I'm just here helping.

14:59.691 --> 15:00.900
- Well, I don't need your help.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.318
Here.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.654
Some pens and printing ink
and cleaner

15:04.696 --> 15:07.157
so this place doesn't
smell like a urinal.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.284
- You get me pineapple
for my hangover?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.327
- Take a shower.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.663
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a screw-up,
everyone hates me,

15:13.705 --> 15:14.581
I smell so bad.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.543
Love you, Tía.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.587
- What?

15:26.718 --> 15:28.386
You don't talk now?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.020
- You always babysit?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.980
- Oh, he does talk.

15:40.315 --> 15:44.778
Yes, I babysit when it's a baby
Eric barely vetted.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.446
- Oh, okay.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.407
So Eric ain't as in charge
as he fronts, huh?

15:51.034 --> 15:53.578
- Okay, there's the car.
Up ahead to the right.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.241
- What? It's wrong?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.579
[tense music]

16:36.621 --> 16:38.748
* *

16:38.790 --> 16:40.625
- Ambrose?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.293
[pounds on door]
I know you're in there.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.420
- I thought we were
just switching cars.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.421
What's up?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.465
- What do you want?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.009
You can't just come in--
- Your cash is light.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.468
- Hell it is.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.929
- By 20.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.764
- Police got the primo.
I know that.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.933
I ain't paying full
for no stepped-on sham.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.935
- Yeah, you are.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.311
Give me the 20.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.149
- Get out.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.191
- I said--
- Get out my house, bitch.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.609
- Not until you pay.

17:06.651 --> 17:10.155
* *

17:10.196 --> 17:12.574
- You heard her. Pay.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.492
- [grunts]

17:14.534 --> 17:16.077
[groans] Mattress.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.412
Kid's bed.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.501
- Let him up, bro.

17:23.543 --> 17:30.383
* *

17:57.160 --> 17:59.329
- Okay. What?

17:59.371 --> 18:00.413
- She didn't put the money
in the trap.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.665
- No.
- He caught that, right?

18:02.707 --> 18:09.673
* *

18:11.299 --> 18:13.259
- What the hell was that?
[engine turns over]

18:18.807 --> 18:20.058
- She is clearly more involved

18:20.100 --> 18:22.686
in the trafficking
than we thought.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.728
- Hmm.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.152
- Stop staring at me. Eat.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.198
- Why are we here?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.658
- I told you--I'm hungry,

18:36.700 --> 18:39.119
and my husband's not expecting
me home for another hour.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.792
You Mexican?

18:45.834 --> 18:48.044
- Guatemalan.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.546
- Hmm.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.881
Well, eat, 'cause you're gonna
wish you were Mexican.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.425
[Torres chuckles]

19:01.599 --> 19:03.560
Mm?
- I forgot napkins.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.353
- No. Sit.
I'm gonna get them.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.230
Just eat, please.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.442
[speaking Spanish indistinctly]

19:23.705 --> 19:25.957
- You're right.
Food's really good.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.584
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.254
- The owner is from the
same town that I grew up in.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.756
- I thought you were
from Chicago.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.759
- [chuckles] You're letting
my husband's money fool you.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.595
He likes me to look like
a rich American bitch.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.765
- Can I ask you a question?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.892
- Mm-hmm.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.480
- What was that in there?

19:49.814 --> 19:50.815
- The job.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.276
- No. Not that part.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.239
Why didn't you
put the 20 in the trap?

20:04.162 --> 20:06.623
- Are you accusing me
of skimming?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.166
- Are you?

20:21.012 --> 20:22.097
[Gloria clears throat]

20:22.138 --> 20:25.100
[soft tense music]

20:25.141 --> 20:32.232
* *

20:33.483 --> 20:35.360
[tray crashes loudly]

20:40.365 --> 20:42.200
- I don't need you fat.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.455
When I went by the shop,
Eric said you were still out.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.502
- Yeah, I was checking out
Eric's new guy.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.838
We did a car switch.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.381
Turned out well.

20:59.551 --> 21:02.679
- You're the new guy?
Is that right?

21:04.848 --> 21:06.266
Todo bien?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.480
- Todo bien.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.943
- Mm.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.361
Come on, let's go.

21:18.403 --> 21:25.410
* *

21:36.629 --> 21:36.838
.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.339
- We can use her.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.799
It'll let us
skip all the way up to Perez.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.009
- Explain.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.886
- Gloria's not just
some cartel trophy wife.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.679
She's in real deep.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.389
- Torres managed
to get Gloria's burner number.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.807
We pinged it.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.476
Every day, her phone pings
at multiple drug corners

21:49.517 --> 21:52.395
across Perez's territory
and at Ultra Motors daily.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.439
- Best guess, she's keeping
the dealers in line.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.024
- Perez is using her
like a shield.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.401
He's controlling her and
hurting her, and she hates it.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.569
She wants out.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.945
- How do you know that?

22:00.987 --> 22:03.365
- I saw it, and...

22:03.406 --> 22:04.532
I know what it looks like.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.743
- We dug into Perez's ex-wives.
- Mm.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.870
- Wife number one
did three stays at a hospital

22:08.912 --> 22:12.499
for falling, then fell off the
radar right after he left her.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.668
No credit. No LKAs.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.336
The woman just disappeared.
- Mm.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.046
- Wife number two allegedly
committed suicide

22:18.088 --> 22:19.839
after 15 years with him.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.050
In each case, the next wife
was waiting in the wings.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.259
- Huh.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.219
- Gloria must know
her time's up.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.387
She knows
he's moving on from her.

22:25.428 --> 22:26.638
- I think
it's already happened.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.350
She wants out, Sarge.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.269
She's the perfect CI waiting
to happen, and I can flip her.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.107
She can get us into
that shipment in two nights.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.150
Hand us Perez.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.819
- Huh.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.779
[knock at door]

22:46.658 --> 22:47.867
- What are you doing here?

22:47.909 --> 22:50.120
- I came to check in on you.
- Why?

22:50.161 --> 22:51.788
- After yesterday, I wanted
to make sure you're okay.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.123
- [scoffing] I'm fine.
- Good.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.125
Then we can finish talking
about the 20k you stole.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.626
[Gloria scoffs]

22:56.668 --> 22:58.378
I can talk about it with you
or with someone else.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.337
- Are you kidding me?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.256
- No.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.425
Come on, let's walk.

23:03.466 --> 23:06.928
[suspenseful music]

23:06.970 --> 23:13.643
* *

23:13.685 --> 23:17.188
- Where are we going?

23:17.230 --> 23:18.523
[sighs]

23:22.485 --> 23:24.112
I don't know who
you think you are.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.405
- Sure, you do.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.948
That's why you rode with me
yesterday, right?

23:26.990 --> 23:30.869
Thought I was a chump,
I wouldn't notice you stealing?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.871
- Yes.

23:32.912 --> 23:39.836
* *

24:07.822 --> 24:09.199
- Ruz, we're gonna have
to break into the Rover.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.159
How we looking?

24:11.201 --> 24:12.660
- I wanna help you.

24:12.702 --> 24:15.497
- Torres is still working her.
Go ahead.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.165
- Go for it.
- All right.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.085
[car alarm blaring]

24:23.546 --> 24:25.715
[car alarm shuts off]

24:25.757 --> 24:27.926
- Yeah, you guys are good.
We got no reaction out here.

24:27.967 --> 24:32.180
* *

24:32.222 --> 24:35.600
- I saw the way your husband
treated you yesterday.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.936
- Oh, is that so?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.105
- Same way my stepdad
treated my ma.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.314
- You don't know me.

24:41.356 --> 24:44.025
- No, but I could.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.443
- Hmm.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.278
[chuckles]

24:47.320 --> 24:49.531
Is that what you're gonna do?

24:49.572 --> 24:51.074
You're gonna get to know me

24:51.116 --> 24:53.910
and help me
get out of this place?

24:53.952 --> 25:00.875
* *

25:03.420 --> 25:06.172
- Hmm. Okay.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.924
Okay.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.301
[grunts]

25:10.343 --> 25:12.053
What's that?
- Can you hold this?

25:12.095 --> 25:14.055
- Yeah.

25:14.097 --> 25:17.517
- You're skimming
so you can get out, right?

25:17.559 --> 25:19.185
An escape fund?

25:20.729 --> 25:23.481
You're gonna need muscle,
and I can be that for you.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.859
Get you what you need faster.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.778
- Why would you do that?

25:30.238 --> 25:31.656
- For a cut.

25:31.698 --> 25:37.829
* *

25:37.871 --> 25:39.914
- Got cash.
- [exhales] Okay.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.085
- Did you help your ma get out?

25:47.464 --> 25:48.757
- Yes.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.053
- How did you get her out?
- It doesn't matter.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.847
- Yes, it does.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.266
Is--is your stepdad
still around?

25:58.308 --> 26:00.101
[notification chimes]

26:04.272 --> 26:06.608
What?

26:06.649 --> 26:07.984
What? What's going on?

26:08.026 --> 26:10.111
- Gloria Perez, Chicago PD.
You're under arrest.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.905
I need you to back up,
turn around,

26:11.946 --> 26:13.948
hands behind your back
right now.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.617
I need you to back up,
turn around,

26:15.658 --> 26:18.286
hands behind your back
right now.

26:18.328 --> 26:25.251
* *

26:28.380 --> 26:32.133
We have you on trafficking
from the car switch.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.803
You're going to jail.

26:34.844 --> 26:37.931
And this bag guarantees
that once word gets out,

26:37.972 --> 26:40.016
your husband will find you...

26:42.185 --> 26:44.270
And kill you.

26:47.065 --> 26:50.151
You know what happened
to his other wives?

26:50.193 --> 26:52.028
- Yes.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.989
- Then you should be scared.

26:57.117 --> 27:00.870
- Is this how
you helped your ma?

27:03.206 --> 27:05.500
- It's prison, get killed,
or you work with us.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.794
- Is this how?

27:07.836 --> 27:09.337
By becoming a cop?

27:09.379 --> 27:10.338
- This came after.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.798
- After what?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.011
- Gloria, this offer

You wanted an escape,

So I made him notice me,

you were a cop.

I didn't want you to.
