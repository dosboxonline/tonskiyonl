00:01.756 --> 00:03.586
I don't see what the heck's
in it for me...

00:03.658 --> 00:05.125
since you've lost
the Aetherium crystal!

00:05.193 --> 00:06.955
We can work.

00:07.028 --> 00:08.757
And I have to find out
the real truth...

00:08.830 --> 00:11.458
about Laputa for myself,
captain.

00:16.171 --> 00:18.799
So, you're not interested
in money...

00:18.874 --> 00:21.104
but you want to find out
the truth about Laputa.

00:21.176 --> 00:22.871
Heh heh. Well, I guess
there's worse reasons...

00:22.944 --> 00:24.536
for you wanting
to become a pirate.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.410
LOUIE: Mother,

00:26.481 --> 00:29.507
DOLA: Tow the line and
work hard, or overboard you go.

00:29.584 --> 00:30.676
PAZU: Yes, captain.

00:30.752 --> 00:33.050
Yes! No more
swabbin' the decks! Hooray!

00:33.121 --> 00:34.520
I won't have
to wash the dishes!

00:34.589 --> 00:37.956
I've peeled my last potato!
Yee-haw!

00:38.026 --> 00:41.792
- Whoopee!
- Whee!

00:41.863 --> 00:43.797
CHARLES:
Sheeta, can you make pudding?

00:43.865 --> 00:45.127
I love pudding!

00:45.200 --> 00:47.293
I get to lick the spatula!

00:47.369 --> 00:49.360
And I like chocolate cake
with that...

00:49.437 --> 00:51.302
Oh, what's that frosting?
It's kind of pink and swirly.

00:51.373 --> 00:54.501
Will you shut up?
Ah, what can I tell you?

00:54.576 --> 00:56.043
They just really like dessert.

01:01.383 --> 01:04.045
SHEETA: Look. Pazu. Look.
It's your house.

01:04.119 --> 01:07.054
Ohh, your birds.
Will they be all right?

01:07.122 --> 01:10.091

Yeah. They'll be fine.

Steady, steady!

01:41.156 --> 01:42.851
SHEETA AND PAZU: Whoa!

01:42.924 --> 01:44.255
And disembark.

01:46.561 --> 01:50.053
Uhh! Wow, what is this ship
made out of, cloth?

01:50.131 --> 01:51.325
And don't you rip it!

01:51.399 --> 01:52.491
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

01:52.567 --> 01:54.535
Come on, we'll go topside.

the wrong way! Come here!

I don't like slow-pokes!

02:04.713 --> 02:05.975
SHEETA: I'm not a slow-poke!
The wind was just...

02:06.047 --> 02:07.708
LOUIE:
You come this way.

02:07.782 --> 02:09.146
- Ohh!

Left, right, left, right.
You're not here to have fun.

02:15.423 --> 02:16.981
As you can see.
this room’s loaded...

02:17.058 --> 02:18.355
with all sorts of gears
and gizmoes.

02:18.426 --> 02:20.792
Whoa. This engine room
is really amazing.

02:20.862 --> 02:22.625
Is that what it's called?

02:22.697 --> 02:25.188
Hey, papa! Where are you?!

02:25.267 --> 02:26.461
Oh!

02:26.534 --> 02:30.197
Hey, pop, I finally found you
an assistant!

02:30.272 --> 02:32.866
Stop yelling at me!
I can hear you!

02:32.941 --> 02:34.738
Believe me,

02:34.809 --> 02:36.572
Come on, assistant,

02:36.645 --> 02:39.808
Uh, hurry up. He is
even tougher than my mother.

02:39.881 --> 02:41.815

who's mechanically minded.

[Grunting]

02:47.689 --> 02:49.452
It's too narrow. I can't reach.

02:49.524 --> 02:50.855
It's OK. I got it.

02:50.925 --> 02:52.153
- What's your name?
- Pazu.

02:54.296 --> 02:58.289
But the beam from the crystal
was pointing directly due east.

02:58.366 --> 03:00.231
Are you sure about this?

03:00.302 --> 03:03.669
Yes, I'm sure I could see

03:03.738 --> 03:05.968
You know, it's the end

03:06.041 --> 03:07.975
so the sun rose
not from due east...

03:08.043 --> 03:09.635
but a little further south.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.645
The light was pointing
to the left of the hill...

03:11.713 --> 03:13.442
from which the sun rose,

03:13.515 --> 03:15.745
Pretty smart.
Found anything yet?

03:15.817 --> 03:17.944
Haven't found a single thing,
captain.

jamming the airwaves...

03:19.354 --> 03:21.288

the flying devils.

03:21.356 --> 03:24.348
Mom, how can we catch them when

03:24.426 --> 03:27.486
It looks like we're cruising
on the windward side of 'em.

03:27.562 --> 03:30.463
So if we manage
to ride the trade wind...

03:30.532 --> 03:33.365
Let's see. According
to my calculations...

03:33.435 --> 03:36.666
with wind velocity at ten...

03:36.738 --> 03:40.174
Looks to me
like we'll catch 'em.

03:40.241 --> 03:42.675
Attention, all hands!

03:42.744 --> 03:46.043
Goliath is already underway
for Laputa.

03:46.114 --> 03:48.105
We’re gonna set sail
and go after them.

03:48.183 --> 03:49.616
If we can catch the wind...

03:49.684 --> 03:51.879
we'll be on their heels
by tomorrow.

03:51.953 --> 03:55.445
The first man to spy Goliath
will receive ten gold coins.

03:55.523 --> 03:56.956
That's good money!

03:57.025 --> 03:59.619
And if the stories we've heard
about Laputa are true...

03:59.694 --> 04:00.956
there’ll be enough treasure...

04:01.029 --> 04:02.724
to make an honest pirate
of us all.

04:02.797 --> 04:05.732
Ha ha! All right!
All hands aboard!

04:05.800 --> 04:07.859
Look alive and get to work!

04:07.936 --> 04:10.370
Let's show
those military dunderheads...

04:10.438 --> 04:12.838
what the Dola pirate gang
is made of!

04:14.175 --> 04:15.665

Shiver me timbers.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.276
Now you gotta start
dressing like a real pirate.

04:58.353 --> 05:00.913
Let's see... here.

05:00.989 --> 05:02.684

05:02.757 --> 05:04.054
- What?
- Nice.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.753

batten down hatches...

05:06.828 --> 05:09.058
and keep the Tiger Moth
ready for action.

I want it shipshape...

05:20.942 --> 05:23.069
sparkling clean. And
ready for action in one hour.

- But l...

I'm afraid I'm still cooking.
Nothing's ready yet.

06:39.687 --> 06:43.316

to clean everything up.

06:43.391 --> 06:46.326
- Ahem.
- Uh, yes? What is it?

06:48.062 --> 06:49.154
Uh...

06:49.230 --> 06:50.822
Yes?

06:50.899 --> 06:52.662
I finished my work
for the moment...

06:52.734 --> 06:54.725
and I've come to offer you
my help.

06:54.802 --> 06:56.429
Well, that's kind of you.

06:56.504 --> 06:58.529
Would you please hand me
those plates over there?

06:58.606 --> 07:00.836
With pleasure,

- What are you doing here?
- Helping.

I thought you said
you had a stomach ache.

07:06.915 --> 07:09.281
I'm in love with you!

- Hello.

07:26.434 --> 07:28.265
What's come over you, my dear?

07:28.336 --> 07:31.362
It's not like you to challenge
a ship like Goliath.

07:31.439 --> 07:33.373
You know,

07:33.441 --> 07:36.171
I'm after treasure. That's all.

07:36.244 --> 07:39.975
Heh heh heh. I must admit,

07:40.048 --> 07:42.573
What do you mean by that,
you old fool?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.345
Nothing.
But that little girl...

07:44.419 --> 07:46.910

not so long ago.

a second helping.

09:32.884 --> 09:34.476
SHEETA: That's better.

09:35.787 --> 09:37.516
PAZU:
We have to be really quiet.

09:37.589 --> 09:39.489
We don't want Dola
to know you’re up here.

09:39.557 --> 09:42.526
This is great.
Now we can keep watch together.

09:42.594 --> 09:44.494
- Pazu?
- Hmm?

09:44.562 --> 09:46.530
SHEETA: I'm really scared.

09:46.598 --> 09:49.726
To tell you the truth,
I don't want to go to Laputa.

09:49.801 --> 09:51.359
PAZU: You don't want
to go to Laputa?

09:51.436 --> 09:53.063
What do you mean?
I don't get it.

09:53.137 --> 09:54.502
Didn't you tell Dola
the truth?

09:54.572 --> 09:55.732
Huh?

09:55.807 --> 09:57.468
SHEETA:
I didn't lie to Dola.

09:57.542 --> 10:00.204
What I said about
the light's direction is true.

10:00.278 --> 10:02.872
But what if someone else dies?

10:02.947 --> 10:04.312
PAZU:
You mean. Like the robot?

10:04.382 --> 10:06.316
SHEETA:
He died to save my life.

10:06.384 --> 10:08.318
I feel awful.

10:08.386 --> 10:12.049
All this is because of a spell
my grandmother taught me.

10:12.123 --> 10:14.717
She taught me
all sorts of spells.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.522
A spell to use when you’re
looking for something...

10:17.595 --> 10:19.324
a spell to cure sickness.

10:19.397 --> 10:22.730
There’s even one she told me
I must never use.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.735
- What kind of spell?
- The spell of destruction.

10:25.803 --> 10:28.101
SHEETA: She said that
to give power to good spells...

10:28.172 --> 10:30.197
I had to know evil ones. Too.

10:30.275 --> 10:32.539
But she told me
never to use it.

10:32.610 --> 10:35.204
I was so scared
when I learned that spell...

10:35.280 --> 10:36.474
I couldn't sleep.

10:36.547 --> 10:39.539
I didn't know the spells
were connected to my necklace.

10:39.617 --> 10:41.551
Uncle Pom was right
when he said...

10:41.619 --> 10:45.055
that it was dangerous for us to
misuse the power of the crystal.

10:45.123 --> 10:47.614
And what if Laputa
has the same power...

10:47.692 --> 10:50.456
that can also be used
for great evil?

10:50.528 --> 10:53.088
I wish
I'd thrown the crystal away.

10:53.164 --> 10:54.927
But then we never
would have met.

10:54.999 --> 10:58.230
And anyway, even if you had,
Laputa would still exist.

10:58.303 --> 11:01.466
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

11:01.539 --> 11:03.939
You know, eventually,
some explorer or another...

11:04.008 --> 11:07.444
will come across the city
of Laputa one day and claim it.

11:07.512 --> 11:09.446
I can't say
I know what's best...

11:09.514 --> 11:11.448
but if Laputa really has
such great power...

11:11.516 --> 11:12.847
we can't let it
fall into the hands...

11:12.917 --> 11:15.545
of bad people like Muska.

11:15.620 --> 11:20.785
And if we run away now,
Muska is gonna chase us forever.

11:20.858 --> 11:23.019
But Pazu, I don't want you
to become a pirate...

11:23.094 --> 11:24.425
because of me.

11:24.495 --> 11:26.463
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

11:26.531 --> 11:28.556
And don't worry.
Dola will understand.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.965
She's much nicer
than she pretends to be.

11:31.035 --> 11:32.866
And when
we've finally found it...

11:32.937 --> 11:34.962
I promise you
we'll go back to Gondoa.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.700
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

born, the valley and everything.

Oh. Pazu. Thank you.

11:42.547 --> 11:45.482
- Sheeta, what's that?

11:45.550 --> 11:47.780
Right there. Under the ship.
See it?

11:47.852 --> 11:49.820
SHEETA: What is it?

11:51.823 --> 11:55.350
- Oh. No!
- "Oh. No" is right.

12:37.902 --> 12:40.564
It's useless to look for them
in the cloud cover.

12:40.638 --> 12:44.130
I don't need to waste my energy
on a wild-goose chase.

12:44.208 --> 12:47.143
Besides. We’re running
right on schedule.

12:59.223 --> 13:01.555
It was farther north
than I figured.

13:01.626 --> 13:04.060
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

13:04.128 --> 13:07.154
Everything will be ruined
if we lose track of Goliath.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.698
You've got good eyes.
so I want you...

13:08.766 --> 13:10.233
to watch her
and keep us on course.

13:10.301 --> 13:11.393
How do I do that, captain?

13:11.469 --> 13:13.334
The crow's nest
can be made into a kite.

13:13.404 --> 13:14.894
See the metal handle
on the bulkhead?

- Turn it clockwise!

That'll make the wings open.

- Yes.
- Best you come down right now.

13:37.595 --> 13:38.960
SHEETA: Why?

13:39.030 --> 13:41.555
Because you're a girl...
a female! That's man's work!

But you're female, captain!

13:43.501 --> 13:45.662

I can do this!

13:45.736 --> 13:46.828
Sheeta, no!

13:46.904 --> 13:50.396

And Pazu agrees with me.

13:52.577 --> 13:54.545
All right, me hearty,
once you take off...

13:54.612 --> 13:56.341
you'll have to use the phone
to communicate.

could also be above you.

in the wrong place.

15:41.552 --> 15:42.849
We're out of position.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.911
You're right. We're supposed
to be heading east, not north.

We're going the wrong way.
Captain!

15:47.091 --> 15:49.355

we're headed north?

is pointing east, mom.

28:59.649 --> 29:02.209
You know what, Sheeta?

29:02.285 --> 29:05.743
He's got plenty of friends...
the animals and the birds.

29:05.822 --> 29:07.847
He takes care of them.

29:13.897 --> 29:15.865
[Squawking]

29:19.703 --> 29:21.603
[Panting]

29:21.671 --> 29:23.434
[Boom]

29:23.507 --> 29:24.838
This way!

29:28.478 --> 29:31.106
[Boom]

29:33.116 --> 29:35.778
[Wind whistling]

29:35.852 --> 29:38.286
The army has destroyed
this part of the city!

29:38.355 --> 29:41.222
SOLDIER: All right. Men.
Let's move it!

29:41.291 --> 29:44.192
- Let's move!
- Yes. Sirr!

29:44.261 --> 29:46.286
Come on. Double time!

29:46.363 --> 29:47.830
SHEETA:
Isn't that the Tiger Moth?

29:47.898 --> 29:49.832
PAZU: That's Dola's ship.
all right. It's been hit.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.333
Wow. Goliath's bigger
than I thought.

29:51.401 --> 29:52.891
Just look at
all those soldiers.

29:52.969 --> 29:55.028
SHEETA:
We have to do something. Pazu.

29:55.105 --> 29:56.902
PAZU: I know. But what?

29:56.973 --> 30:00.136
SHEETA: I sure hope Dola
and the boys are all right.

30:00.210 --> 30:03.373
PAZU: Me, too. Where are they?
Do you see them?

30:03.447 --> 30:06.211
Wait! There they are!
They've got 'em prisoner!

30:06.283 --> 30:08.217
SHEETA: They've been captured!
We've got to help them!

30:08.285 --> 30:10.253
If we don't, they'll hang 'em
from the yardarm!

30:10.320 --> 30:13.448
- What'll we do?
- Come on.

30:13.523 --> 30:15.252
Hurry!

30:15.325 --> 30:17.259
Sir! Sir!

30:17.327 --> 30:20.524
We've managed
to break down the wall, general.

30:20.597 --> 30:23.259
Just a sample
of what we found inside.

30:23.333 --> 30:26.268
The city
is full of treasure. Sirr.

30:26.336 --> 30:27.963
- Mama!
- Whoa.

30:28.038 --> 30:30.563
Wouldn't you like to have this?

30:30.640 --> 30:33.666
Well, I've got a different
kind of necklace for you!

30:33.743 --> 30:36.439
Have you radioed a report
on Laputa's discovery, Muska?

30:36.513 --> 30:37.775
I was about to.

30:37.848 --> 30:40.544
See if you can make it
difficult to decode.

30:40.617 --> 30:43.586
And stop pocketing
those jewels, you scum!

30:45.122 --> 30:48.649
MUSKA: The perfect thing to
throw those fools off the scent.

31:05.175 --> 31:07.006
We're up so high.

31:07.077 --> 31:09.102
I hope you're good
at climbing trees, Sheeta.

31:11.081 --> 31:12.548
I've got a plan.

31:14.518 --> 31:15.678
Ohh!

31:16.953 --> 31:19.922
[Muffled explosions]

31:25.362 --> 31:28.058
[Explosions]

31:28.131 --> 31:30.292
[Soldiers shouting]

31:31.334 --> 31:32.460
[Grunting]

31:45.515 --> 31:48.245
PAZU:
What a greedy pack of thieves.

31:48.318 --> 31:51.287
We can't let them
destroy the garden, Pazu.

31:51.354 --> 31:53.652
We have to find
the Aetherium crystal.

31:53.723 --> 31:55.156
[Gasps]

31:55.225 --> 31:56.351
We have to find it.

31:56.426 --> 31:58.417
It's the only way
we can protect the garden.

31:58.495 --> 31:59.621
I was wondering why...

31:59.696 --> 32:01.163
all of the storm clouds
just disappeared.

32:01.231 --> 32:03.199
Then I realized
if they hadn't cleared up...

32:03.266 --> 32:05.166
the army
couldn't have made a landing.

32:05.235 --> 32:07.703
You think it was
because of my necklace?

32:07.771 --> 32:09.238
I don't know for sure,

32:09.306 --> 32:11.672
the power of the crystal
disintegrated that storm...

32:11.741 --> 32:14.107
and now the castle
has awakened from its sleep...

32:14.177 --> 32:16.304
for whoever holds the crystal.

32:18.248 --> 32:21.183
We can't let Muska figure out
how to use the crystal.

32:21.251 --> 32:24.118
If he does.
it'll be the end of everything.

32:24.187 --> 32:26.587
But even if we can get
my grandmother's crystal back...

32:26.656 --> 32:28.453
how can we use its power?

32:28.525 --> 32:30.720
[Gasps] The spell, Pazu!

32:30.794 --> 32:32.819
The spell of destruction.

32:32.896 --> 32:34.363
Sheeta, it may be the only way.

32:34.431 --> 32:35.659
- What is it?
- Huh?

32:35.732 --> 32:37.495
FIRST SOLDIER: Over here.
I thought I heard something.

32:40.837 --> 32:42.532
SECOND SOLDIER:
Do you see anything?

32:42.606 --> 32:45.006
FIRST SOLDIER:
No. All clear.

32:45.075 --> 32:46.770
FIRST SOLDIER:
We need help over here!

Go find the general!

Somebody give us a hand!

32:51.615 --> 32:53.014
SECOND SOLDIER:
Move now! You heard me!

32:57.654 --> 32:59.019
Quickly!

33:02.092 --> 33:04.060
We need to get down there.

[Dramatic music playing]

33:11.001 --> 33:12.400
[Panting]

33:21.144 --> 33:22.736
I'll go first.

33:22.812 --> 33:24.677
Right. Be careful.

MAN: We're looking
for a doorway, colonel?

33:49.105 --> 33:51.039
I don't see anything. Sirr.

33:51.107 --> 33:52.870

33:52.942 --> 33:54.034

Well, well, looks like

34:26.376 --> 34:28.742
Don't hurt her!

- Unh!
- It came from over here!

34:31.380 --> 34:34.839
- Colonel, what's happening?
- We've found another pirate.

Is that Pazu?

Huh? Uhh... thank you.

35:47.957 --> 35:50.892
The boy has become a man.

35:50.960 --> 35:55.124
What? What do you mean, Muska's
destroyed all the radios?

35:55.198 --> 35:58.759
Sir! He must've done it while
most of the men were outside.

35:58.835 --> 36:01.326
Several of the guards
have been seriously injured.

36:01.404 --> 36:04.032
We've spotted Muska heading
for the black dome below, sir.

36:04.107 --> 36:06.632
He's not alone. He's got
those other two men with him.

36:06.709 --> 36:09.803
So, Colonel Muska reveals

36:09.879 --> 36:12.040
Now find him and arrest him!

All right, first platoon, move!

36:43.880 --> 36:45.780
We are in the center of Laputa.

36:45.849 --> 36:47.783
The castle above us
means nothing!

36:47.851 --> 36:50.149
All of Laputa's
scientific knowledge...

is allowed to enter.

don't belong in this chamber!

of all the power in Laputa.

The amazing thing
is this beautiful stone...

has been awaiting the return
of its king for 700 years.

38:18.808 --> 38:20.207
SHEETA:
Seven hundred years?

38:20.276 --> 38:25.009
700 years is a long time
to be without a king, isn't it?

38:28.084 --> 38:31.212
It's the black stone,

38:35.091 --> 38:37.025
[Insects buzzing]

38:37.093 --> 38:39.027
Get away! [Grunts]

38:40.863 --> 38:43.024

38:47.337 --> 38:52.297
Yes, my dear.
l, too, have an old secret name.

have the same royal ancestors.

39:01.317 --> 39:03.046
We are both of noble blood.

39:03.119 --> 39:05.383
But then our ancestors
left Laputa to live on earth.

39:05.455 --> 39:06.547
What a mistake!

39:06.623 --> 39:09.285
[Boom]

39:16.132 --> 39:19.693
- The explosives have no effect!
- This is no ordinary stone!

39:19.769 --> 39:21.669
Then use all of the dynamite
we have!

39:21.738 --> 39:23.831
MUSKA: General.
there is no need to do that.

39:23.906 --> 39:25.635

40:22.331 --> 40:26.097
why you hesitate. General.
Please come in.

- Up there!

- Whoa.
- What's going on?

Hold your tongue, commoner!

of the king of Laputa!

41:02.772 --> 41:04.706
The man has gone crazy!

41:04.774 --> 41:07.675
I thought I would show you
an example of Laputa's power.

41:07.744 --> 41:09.473
We are about to celebrate
the rebirth...

41:42.311 --> 41:44.711
Sodom and Gomorrah
in the Old Testament.

41:44.781 --> 41:48.717
The Rahmaniya referred to it
as Indra's Arrow.

41:48.785 --> 41:50.776
The entire world
will once again kneel...

41:50.853 --> 41:52.946
before the power of Laputa.

41:53.022 --> 41:57.516
I can only say well-done, Muska.
You're a credit to our country.

41:57.593 --> 41:59.925
As such,

42:03.166 --> 42:05.964
[Clicking] Huh?

42:51.881 --> 42:54.679
- Check the flapters!
- OK, mom!

43:12.935 --> 43:14.300
Oh!

43:14.370 --> 43:17.635
You had better be gracious
to the new king, dear.

43:17.707 --> 43:19.470
Ohh!

43:19.542 --> 43:23.137
You and I will be spending
quite a lot of time together.

43:25.514 --> 43:27.709
Look at the fools.

43:27.783 --> 43:30.718

It is useless to fight me.

46:28.597 --> 46:30.531
- You're alive!
- Stand back.

46:30.599 --> 46:32.658
I'm gonna blast through.

46:32.735 --> 46:35.670
- Here we go!
- No, Pazu! Hurry! Take this!

Aah!

46:54.256 --> 46:56.952

Aah!

47:26.655 --> 47:30.113
Get up, princess.
The game is over.

47:36.465 --> 47:39.866
How appropriate that we've
ended up in the throne room.

47:39.935 --> 47:41.402
Now get over here.

47:41.470 --> 47:43.335
This is no longer a throne room.

47:43.405 --> 47:45.896
This is a tomb
for the both of us.

47:47.209 --> 47:49.177
You see, a king
without compassion...

47:49.245 --> 47:50.974
does not deserve a kingdom.

47:51.046 --> 47:53.139
You will never
possess the crystal.

47:53.215 --> 47:56.946
You and I
will die here together.

47:57.019 --> 48:00.648
Now I understand why
the people of Laputa vanished.

48:00.723 --> 48:02.987
There is a song from my home
in the Valley of Gondoa...

48:03.058 --> 48:04.457
that explains everything.

48:04.527 --> 48:07.291
It says,
"Take root in the ground...

48:07.363 --> 48:09.194
"live in harmony
with the wind...

48:09.265 --> 48:11.096
"plant your seeds
in the winter...

48:11.167 --> 48:13.965
"and rejoice with the birds
in the coming of spring."

48:14.036 --> 48:16.163
No matter how many weapons
you have...

48:16.238 --> 48:19.366
no matter how great
your technology might be...

48:19.441 --> 48:21.773
the world cannot live
without love.

48:25.981 --> 48:29.417
Laputa will live.
I will return it to life.

48:29.485 --> 48:33.080
Laputa's power
is the dream of all mankind.

48:34.590 --> 48:37.058
Your ears are next...

48:37.126 --> 48:40.186
unless you get on your knees
and obey me.

48:40.262 --> 48:42.730
I command you.
Give me that stone!

48:42.798 --> 48:45.426

Stop right there. Muska!

48:45.501 --> 48:47.093
I've hidden the stone!

48:47.169 --> 48:48.568
If you do anything
to harm Sheeta...

48:48.637 --> 48:49.968
you'll never get it back!

48:50.039 --> 48:51.700
No, Pazu! Listen!

48:51.774 --> 48:54.709
Run away before he kills you
as well as me!

48:54.777 --> 48:56.005
Look who's here.

48:56.078 --> 48:58.046
Give me the stone,

48:58.113 --> 48:59.273
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

48:59.348 --> 49:02.181
Are you planning
on fighting me?

49:02.251 --> 49:05.709
Go ahead. Use that cannon
you can hardly lift.

49:05.788 --> 49:08.621
You can have the stone
if you let me talk to Sheeta.

49:08.691 --> 49:11.353
No, Pazu! Get out of here

49:11.427 --> 49:14.828
I'll give you one minute,
starting now.

49:43.292 --> 49:45.192
I'll say it with you.

Just put your hand in mine
and trust me.

49:55.004 --> 49:57.700
Tell me
the spell of destruction.

49:57.773 --> 50:00.207
Dola and the boys are free.
Don't worry about them.

50:00.276 --> 50:02.642
Whisper the spell in my ear.

50:04.580 --> 50:07.014
Time's up. What is your answer?

50:07.082 --> 50:08.310

the spell of destruction.
