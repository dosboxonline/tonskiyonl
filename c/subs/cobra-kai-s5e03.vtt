00:14.848 --> 00:16.474
[easy listening music plays]

00:16.558 --> 00:19.978
[Daniel laughs] Well done. Well done.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.149
I told you there were golf courses
all over Okinawa, man.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.360
I googled it.
It's like one giant green island.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.112
He said he'd never played before.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.697
Beginner luck.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.199
[scoffs] Yeah, right.
I know when I've been hustled.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.118
You insult my honor.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.163
Okay, you are not
at a blackjack table in Atlantic City.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.290
You can't trash-talk a karate assassin.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.420
I'm so sorry, Mr. Chozen.
I-I meant no disrespect at all. I promise.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.713
[tense music plays]

00:46.796 --> 00:50.008
-[Chozen laughs]
-[Daniel] Don't take it personally, guys.

00:50.091 --> 00:53.511
He's been kicking a lot of ass lately.
First round's on me, fellas.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224
-[Silver] How'd you hit 'em?
-[ominous music plays]

01:01.519 --> 01:03.521
They let anyone join these days, huh?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.399
Or did you slither in
through the garbage chute?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.902
By the way,
how's your sensei search going?

01:08.985 --> 01:11.738
Did I hear you hit a little bit of a snag?

01:14.115 --> 01:16.868
Sabotaging my dojo was not a smart move.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.331
Some might see it as casus belli.

01:21.414 --> 01:25.085
Miyagi-Do will never back down.
You should know that by now.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.880
-I believe you two have met.
-[Silver] Sensei Toguchi.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.426
You might have some old friends
to call upon,

01:34.552 --> 01:36.137
but not as many as me.

01:36.221 --> 01:40.558
I'm giving you the opportunity,
right now, to stand down.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.519
No retaliation.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.895
No repercussions.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.107
All you have to do is stay out of my way.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.691
This is my backyard.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.277
I'm not the one who needs to go.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.614
I actually like this attitude on you.

01:55.198 --> 02:00.370
It's a shame I won't get to see it again,
because if you continue down this path,

02:00.453 --> 02:03.081
nothing in your life
will ever be the same again.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.292
You're playing with fire, Danny Boy.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.378
[quiet ominous music plays]

02:09.671 --> 02:11.381
And I am gasoline.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.383
Boom.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.801
[ominous music crescendos]

02:15.343 --> 02:16.177
[scoffs]

02:16.261 --> 02:18.847
Put these gentlemen's drinks on my tab.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.354
What did that giant Bond villain want?

02:27.355 --> 02:30.150
Nothing. Just wanted
to buy us a round of drinks.

02:30.233 --> 02:34.237
Oh, nice. Hey, let me get a round
of piña coladas for my men here.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.447
Act like you've been here before.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.867
Your most expensive tequila
in the cabinet.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.244
"Piña colada."
We're not at a Sandals Resort.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.538
[Louie] What's wrong with Sandals?
Everything's included.

02:45.748 --> 02:49.002
Breakfast is served.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.171
This is so sweet.

02:51.254 --> 02:55.425
[in Spanish] My dear, I love you so much.
I can't handle this. How wonderful!

02:55.508 --> 02:56.759
Oh, stop, Mom.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.888
[in English] He'll think he can run away,
come back and get the love he wants.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.306
[in Spanish] Uh, yeah. He can.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.142
[in English] Don't worry.
I'm never doing something like that again.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.185
I'm sorry.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.353
I'm sorry, too, Miggy.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.856
I should've told you the truth
about how I left your father.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.692
You did it for me. I understand that now.

03:12.775 --> 03:16.446
[in Spanish] Oh, how can you
stay mad at him? You just can't!

03:16.529 --> 03:18.531
-[in English] Okay.
-Hey, sorry I'm late.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.993
Graffiti's a bitch to clean off.
You should see my van.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.246
Should be illegal
to deface someone else’s property.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.289
It is.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.002
Well, this looks different.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.337
[Miguel] Yeah, I made it.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.215
Oh, I forgot the orange juice.
Uh, one second.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.550
Everything okay with you and Robby?

03:37.634 --> 03:38.968
Yeah, really good.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.721
Ride home was a little quiet though.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.432
I think things between him
and Miguel are gonna take some time.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.392
Okay, orange juice.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.479
[in Spanish] Oh, Miguel,
are you going to visit your girlfriend?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.189
I bet she misses you.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.108
[in English] Yeah. I think I need
to make an apology meal for Sam too.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.781
[door opens]

03:59.864 --> 04:00.823
[Carmen retches]

04:01.574 --> 04:03.576
Maybe you guys should order in instead.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.203
-[Carmen retches]
-Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.837
Yo, Sam, did you eat
the entire box of grape Uncrustables?

04:15.672 --> 04:19.133
-There were only two left. Slow your roll.
-It's the principle of it.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.468
I need comfort food too.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.845
What happened?
Get pwned in Fortnite again?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.264
I mean, actually, I just…

04:25.348 --> 04:27.558
I'm having trouble
with this kid from Cobra Kai.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.811
The one you chased and poured milk over?

04:29.894 --> 04:32.939
I-I didn't pour milk.
We put it in a bag in his locker.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.650
It doesn't matter.
He's learning some more karate--

04:35.733 --> 04:39.362
Oh my God. If I don't hear "karate"
for the summer, it will still be too soon.

04:39.445 --> 04:43.199
Why've you been acting so weird? 'Cause
another one of your boyfriends ran away?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.454
Text Moon and Yasmine.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.748
"Brunch today?
Need to get out of the house."

04:54.627 --> 04:55.795
[Daniel] We're under his skin.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.214
That's why he came to the country club.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.382
[Chozen groans]

04:59.465 --> 05:01.676
What did you do?
Tweak yourself on the back nine?

05:01.759 --> 05:03.886
No, couch in guest room not good.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.054
I'm sorry about that.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.180
We used to have a bed,

05:06.264 --> 05:09.350
but it got destroyed
when Cobra Kai broke into our house.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.812
Do not worry. I will not allow them
to attack home again.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.230
[Daniel] We may have stalled them,

05:14.314 --> 05:16.899
but if I know Silver,
he's planning his next move now.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.651
Then we beat him to punch.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.903
He said he'd call upon old friends.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.697
Then we call old friend first.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.117
Do you know any old friend of Silver?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.202
[dramatic music plays]

05:29.203 --> 05:31.748
Mr. Silver,
you just bought yourself a champion.

-[laughs]
-[yells]

05:33.458 --> 05:34.542
Hey!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.210
[Barnes] You suck, LaRusso!

05:36.294 --> 05:37.795
-[referee] On your line!
-[groans]

05:37.879 --> 05:41.049
[Barnes] There's nothing you've got
I can't counter. Your karate's a joke.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.718
Mike fucking Barnes.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.604
You sure you're okay?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.274
I'm not the best cook,
but I can teach the kid a few things.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.027
It's not that.
I've felt sick a lot lately.

06:01.110 --> 06:05.239
I thought it was the stress,
but, Johnny, I-I'm a couple of days late.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.450
For what?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.662
I think I might be pregnant.

06:12.872 --> 06:13.706
What?

06:16.292 --> 06:17.752
How? We use protection.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.836
It's not 100%.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.254
These things can happen.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.631
[Johnny] Okay.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.424
Okay.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.427
Okay, okay. This is a good thing, right?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.680
-Or a bad thing?
-I shouldn't have said anything.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.392
We're getting ahead of ourselves.
I haven't taken a test.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.478
Right, the test.
All right, let's pee on a stick.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.481
I mean, you pee on a stick.
That's still how they do this?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.732
-Yes.
-[Johnny] All right.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.442
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.361
Johnny, I'm fine.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.821
Yeah, me too. 100%.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.448
-I'll pull the van around.
-Okay.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.616
[keys clatter]

06:49.742 --> 06:52.286
-Maybe I should drive.
-Yeah, sure. Okay.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.039
Okay.

[exhales]

07:01.170 --> 07:03.339
[rock music continues]

07:03.423 --> 07:05.675
Sweet. Thanks, Aurora.
Tell Rico I said hey.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.848
Wow. Man, you are really
going all-in on Miyagi-Do, huh?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.516
[chuckles] It's a lotus flower.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.144
Symbolizes a new beginning,
which is what I have now.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.730
The reaper was a bitch to cover up.
A giant flower was the only option.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.274
-It works.
-[both chuckle]

07:22.900 --> 07:23.776
[sighs]

07:24.402 --> 07:25.445
Hey, Miguel.

07:26.070 --> 07:26.988
You good?

07:28.489 --> 07:30.992
Yeah. Uh, tired from the trip is all.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.578
[Hawk] Yeah, you spent
how many hours in a car with Robby?

07:34.078 --> 07:38.166
I've never seen you around him
without a John Wick-style fight.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.626
For sensei's sake,
I'm trying not to let it get to that.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.253
Even if he deserves it.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.174
Robby says he's done with Cobra Kai.
We'll see how that goes.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.425
[cell phone chimes]

07:48.259 --> 07:50.178
Is that Sam? She finally text back?

07:50.261 --> 07:52.388
Yeah. Says she wants to, uh, talk tonight.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.890
[Demetri hisses]

07:53.973 --> 07:55.057
What did she say exactly?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.268
"We should talk tonight."

07:58.144 --> 07:59.187
What?

07:59.270 --> 08:02.648
It says, "We should talk?"
Oh, brother, you're in deep.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.234
She's right. We should talk.
Last time we spoke, we had a fight.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.946
Yeah, but "We should talk"
is code for "I want to break up."

08:09.030 --> 08:09.906
What? It is?

08:09.989 --> 08:12.867
Not necessarily.
Moon is really big on communication.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.579
-Maybe Sam does just wanna talk?
-No, no. We need more information.

08:16.662 --> 08:20.791
Uh, we should send a trial balloon.
Something that puts the ball in her court.

08:20.875 --> 08:24.754
"Can't wait to see you tonight."
Um, "How are you?"

08:24.837 --> 08:25.922
-That's good.
-Right?

08:26.005 --> 08:26.923
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.799
[Demetri] It's gonna be fine. It's fine.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.051
[cell phone chimes]

08:30.134 --> 08:32.011
[Yasmine chuckles] Desperate.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.513
But cute.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.306
He knows he's in deep shit.

08:36.974 --> 08:40.019
I just… I feel like
things have been off lately.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.523
There's so much I wanna say.
Maybe I should just… lay it all out?

08:43.606 --> 08:44.440
No!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.901
No, less is more.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.530
I'm with Yas. It's better
to have these conversations in person.

08:50.613 --> 08:54.075
Mm-hm. Keep it short, not sweet.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.452
"I'm okay."

08:57.203 --> 08:59.413
Should I add a smiley face or something?

08:59.497 --> 09:00.456
-No!
-Definitely.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.544

-[cell phone chimes]
-[Miguel and Demetri sigh]

09:07.255 --> 09:10.883
-That's bad. There's not even an emoji.
-Yeah, man, she is not okay.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.261
You need to do something
to turn this around stat.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.178
What do I do?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.473
I think I have an idea.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.433
[rock music crescendos]

09:24.522 --> 09:25.481
There he is.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.567
[dramatic music plays]

09:41.497 --> 09:42.832
[Daniel] Karate's bad boy.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.294
Eh, he does not look so bad to me.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.630
[Daniel] Yeah, well,
that guy tried to kill me once.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.133
You don't forget
or forgive something like that.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.384
[engine revs]

09:55.595 --> 09:58.222
Except you. You and I, we're good.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.353
[tense music plays]

10:29.128 --> 10:31.756
What's he got there? Some sort of handsaw?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.133
Good for cutting pipe.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.136
[tense music continues]

10:38.638 --> 10:40.848
That one, good for cutting bone.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.851
[tense music continues]

10:43.934 --> 10:46.479
[Daniel] Looks like he's got
some goons working for him.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.023
Ah, easy for me to handle.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.484
No, I don't want you
getting in any more fights.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.943
I'll take care of this.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.112
Daniel-san, you cannot go alone.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.030
Don't worry.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.282
I'm gonna do
exactly what Mr. Miyagi would do.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.867
And what is that?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.078
Avoid the fight. Right?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.706
[tense music crescendos]

11:08.918 --> 11:09.752
Hi.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.213
Morning after pill or pregnancy test?

11:13.297 --> 11:16.092
-Is it that obvious?
-One pregnancy test, please.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.803
Or two, or however many come in a box.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.304
Aisle two. Plenty of options.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.472
All right.

11:21.555 --> 11:22.473
And also,

11:23.808 --> 11:26.310
I'm gonna need a refund for these.
They do not work.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.774
There's no way these were purchased
at a real pharmacy.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.859
It doesn't matter. I want my money back.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.953
Is that the best one? We can buy
the premium version, whatever you like.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.538
Johnny, take a breath.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.290
[sighs] Sorry, yeah.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.585
When Shannon was pregnant, I wasn't ready.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.380
I felt useless.
I don't wanna be that guy again.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.297
I understand.

11:55.381 --> 12:00.010
Miguel was a surprise too. I was scared.
But now we have each other. Right?

12:00.094 --> 12:00.970
Right.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.304
[baby cries]

12:02.388 --> 12:04.098
[man] Please, stop crying.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.184
[baby wails]

12:07.268 --> 12:08.102
Please.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.481
[baby continues crying]

12:12.565 --> 12:14.525
Oh God, now I think I'm gonna get sick.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.694
[baby continues crying]

12:18.362 --> 12:21.282
-Looks like you're still not ready.
-Shit. Carmen, wait.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.702
Johnny, this should be simple,
and you're making me nervous.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.537
-I'll take the test later.
-Okay.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.583
Maybe in the meantime, you can figure out
how not to be that guy again.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.127
[baby cries]

12:33.210 --> 12:34.044
Yeah.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.718
Moon, this place is so you.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.178
Isn't it?

12:43.429 --> 12:47.349
When Eli and I broke up the first time,
there was a lot of negative energy.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.854
This place helped cut through the noise.
Which is why I brought you here.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.566
You gotta find yourself.
Figure out who you really are.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.568
They also do facials. So…

13:09.997 --> 13:11.749
What is this, exactly?

13:11.832 --> 13:15.127
This is a self-actualization pod.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.214
-So like a sensory deprivation tank?
-Oh, no, no, no. No.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.883
They don't call them that anymore.
It's not about deprivation.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.803
It's about connection
with your innermost self.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.846
Thanks, but I'm still gonna pass.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.016
I have nightmares
about drowning in shallow water.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.602
Wow. That's dark.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.564
Sam, ever since the tournament,
you've been off balance.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.983
It's clear there's been
some tension with Miguel.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.320
The only thing
you're gonna find in this pod is yourself.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.656
That's not so scary, right?

13:49.328 --> 13:53.707
I got Yasmine a charm bracelet here,
plus a charm for every fight we have.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.501
She can barely lift her arm now.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.671
Okay, explain to me again
why I have to buy expensive jewelry.

13:58.754 --> 14:02.049
Maybe Sam is okay, and you guys
are just reading too much into it.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.927
My friend, this is a five-alarm fire.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.721
If anything,
we're not reading into it enough. Okay?

14:08.305 --> 14:09.890
[woman] Can I help you find something?

14:09.974 --> 14:12.977
Um, yes. I'm looking
for something special for my girlfriend.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.021
That's so sweet!
Is it a birthday, an anniversary?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.606
He left the country without telling her

14:17.690 --> 14:19.859
during the biggest karate fight
of her life.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
That's a new one.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.114
[clears throat] How about
a nice pair of earrings?

14:25.197 --> 14:26.448
How much is that?

14:26.532 --> 14:27.575
The octopus?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.081
It's perfect.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.501
But I don't think
I'm gonna be able to afford it.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.629
Actually, it's been reduced.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.089
Reduced?

14:42.631 --> 14:43.757
Great. How much?

14:44.383 --> 14:47.052
After tax, $182.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.512
[sighs]

14:48.596 --> 14:50.806
Do you maybe have one
with fewer tentacles?

14:51.307 --> 14:53.309
[suspenseful music plays]

15:03.569 --> 15:07.031
[Barnes] It's good to be back in business.
Just like old times, right?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.534
Hey, don't worry about me. I'm ready.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.622
I've been telling you to get rid
of that Italian piece of shit for years.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.917
Ah, flew in from Japan.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.044
Wow, that's dedication.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.921
You think that scares me?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.842
By the time I'm finished with them,
they're gonna be unrecognizable.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.261
You know, I think I know
exactly how to do it.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.722
I think I'm gonna start

15:33.140 --> 15:34.892
by cutting off their legs.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.480
You know what? Enough chitchat.
Let's get down to brass tacks.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.525
Now, for me to do my very best,
I'm gonna need 50%.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.570
You owe me that much
after what happened last time. [laughs]

15:46.654 --> 15:47.905
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.824
Oh yeah.
Those kids are in for a big surprise.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.869
Barnes, no!
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.332
I'm not gonna have you or your ponytailed
pimp lay one finger on any of our kids.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.459
Daniel LaRusso?

16:00.542 --> 16:03.629
You got that right, shithead.
You hear me, you sick bastard?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.298
I'm onto you
and I'm onto the whole goddamn thing.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.008
[woman] I'm sorry, who is this?

16:08.592 --> 16:10.719
-And what happened to Michael?
-Who's this?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.055
Everything okay, Mr. Barnes?
I heard yelling.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.433
Yes. Yes, everything's fine.
Thank you, Phil.

16:21.063 --> 16:21.981
Michelle?

16:22.731 --> 16:25.484
Yeah, I promise
I will have the Japanese cedar chairs done

16:25.567 --> 16:27.069
by the time the school opens.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.156
I'm gonna send over a couple of my guys
to pick up the Florentine table.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.659
Fine.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.536
40% commission.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.579
Done.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.166
What's going on here?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.257
You work in a furniture store?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.801
Daniel, I own the furniture store.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.826
There is a lot of work to do
before your little blessing arrives.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.536
Let's get to it.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.749
Tuck the swaddle behind the ear.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.959
[rock music continues]

17:24.043 --> 17:27.171
Pick up the head like this, gently.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.591
And just like that…

17:31.216 --> 17:32.342
Oh, shit.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.803
…you'll be ready
when the real one arrives.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.016
Your little miracle
needs a healthy, organic diet.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.269
[rock music continues]

17:43.270 --> 17:44.521
[groans]

17:44.605 --> 17:47.357
[woman] Your little one
will pick up on negative influences,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.902
so make sure your space is baby friendly.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.987
[rock music continues]

17:56.116 --> 17:57.826
[woman] Don't think it's over yet,

17:57.910 --> 18:00.954
because you need to look
in every nook and cranny

18:01.038 --> 18:03.916
for things like mold,
pests, and other hazards.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.209
[rock music continues]

18:06.752 --> 18:07.878
Oh shit!

18:07.961 --> 18:10.089
[rock music continues]

18:26.438 --> 18:30.526
[woman] And if you think this was hard,
wait till the baby arrives.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.988
[rock music fades]

18:36.865 --> 18:39.243
Mike, once again, I apologize.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.370
My life has been
a little out of sorts lately.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.706
If there is one guy in this world
that doesn't owe me an apology,

18:44.790 --> 18:45.999
believe me, it's you.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.168
Look, man, I'm so sorry

18:48.252 --> 18:51.797
for the things that I said
back in the day, the things that I did.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.801
Man, I have wanted
to apologize to you so many times.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.637
I-I guess I was worried
it would trigger something.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.432
You know, I thought maybe it was just best
to leave the past where it is.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.810
Ah, that's a good idea.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.772
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around Mike Barnes, Furniture King.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.941
Well, Furniture Co-King.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.694
I run it with my wife.
It's actually her dad's place.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.445
Well, it was her dad's place.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.283
After the All Valley tournament,
my life was ruined.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.911
I mean, I was lost. I was banned
from karate, which was all I knew.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.913
So I found myself working odd jobs.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.000
One day I'm moving furniture,
and I meet my future father-in-law.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.503
He showed me I could do something
with these hands other than fight.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.589
[sighs] I don't know, there's just

19:34.631 --> 19:36.967
something about taking a piece of sycamore

19:37.467 --> 19:41.263
and just creating something
that a family can sit around at a holiday,

19:41.346 --> 19:43.432
and, I don't know, it just feels right.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.226
-Wow. Man, talk about a 180.
-[Mike laughs]

19:46.310 --> 19:49.188
Yeah, I know. Hey, what about you, huh?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.940
I've seen your commercials.
You know, chopping down prices.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.651
I'm really happy
that things have worked out for you.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.612
Yeah, well, it's…

They actually aren't working out
so great lately.

I'm not sure.
I'm supposed to be figuring out who I am.

What do you mean? You're LaRusso 2.0.

You're my girlfriend, Sam.

I was a drop of dew
glistening in the moonlight.

Are you okay?

what he was after.

Not yet. Not if I have
anything to say about it.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.079
To have this psycho
invading your life again,

22:52.162 --> 22:53.663
I can't imagine what that's like.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.042
I came here because I thought
he might be recruiting you again.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.379
And now I'm just hoping
that you could help me stop him.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.256
Anything you could tell me
that might bring this guy down?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.424
I need something.

23:04.508 --> 23:09.262
I mean, I haven't even seen him in years.
I just don't know what I could do to help.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.765
I understand.
I'm actually kind of relieved.

23:11.848 --> 23:16.520
It's nice to know there are ex-Cobra Kai
who don't wanna get in a fight with me.

you know where to find me.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.769
[Barnes grunts]

23:57.853 --> 24:00.230
[dramatic music fades]

24:01.648 --> 24:04.234
-[dramatic music resumes]
-[grunting]

24:04.317 --> 24:06.194
-[Daniel] No!
-[groaning]

24:06.278 --> 24:08.071
Guys, whoa! Stop! Just stop!

24:08.155 --> 24:10.657
Chozen, he didn't attack me.
He's on the same side.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.703
Wait a minute. This guy's with you?
What the hell, Daniel?

24:14.786 --> 24:17.539
This is just a giant misunderstanding.

24:17.622 --> 24:21.084
Oh. If this is misunderstanding,
you better call ambulance.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.797
[men groan]

24:26.631 --> 24:28.633
[tense music plays]

24:34.764 --> 24:36.766
[tense music fades]

24:36.850 --> 24:37.767
Hey, sensei.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.979
Do you, uh, have a second?
I-I need your advice.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.731
-Yeah.
-[Miguel] I, uh…

24:43.982 --> 24:44.816
[sniffs]

24:45.942 --> 24:47.110
What is that smell?

24:47.194 --> 24:49.237
It's either paint thinner or pesticide.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.074
Don't worry, it'll air out in a few days.
Breathe through your mouth.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.327
What's with the, uh…
What's with the place?

24:55.952 --> 24:56.828
Oh, it's, uh…

24:59.247 --> 25:00.790
Don't worry. Making a few changes.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.085
-Have a seat.
-[Miguel] Okay.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.757
-Want milk? I got a fridge full of it.
-Nah, I'm good. Thanks.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.594
Uh, okay, um…

25:13.178 --> 25:15.138
I think Sam and I are having issues,

25:15.222 --> 25:18.808
and I've been talking
to Hawk and Demetri about it, but--

25:18.892 --> 25:22.354
Hawk's a stud but I wouldn't trust
a word that dork Demetri has to say.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.482
-He's had a girlfriend for a while.
-I'm sure she's a real looker.

25:26.816 --> 25:30.195
Anyway, um, I'm supposed
to meet with Sam tonight,

25:30.278 --> 25:32.322
but I have this feeling
she's still mad at me,

25:32.405 --> 25:36.409
and I wanna fix it,
but we haven't spoken in a while.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.871
And honestly, I'm not even sure
what I'm supposed to say.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.498
[pensive music plays]

25:41.581 --> 25:42.582
I've been there.

25:45.835 --> 25:46.878
How about the truth?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.007
We all get shit wrong sometimes.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.010
Some of us get it wrong a lot.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.348
If you own up to your mistakes,
you have a shot at making things right.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.476
You don't have to have it all figured out.
Just be honest.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.603
See where it goes from there.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.274
That's actually some really good advice.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.570
Yeah, I guess it is. [sighs]

26:11.653 --> 26:12.696
[pensive music fades]

26:12.779 --> 26:16.575
[sighs] Once again, I'm sorry, Mike.
I mean, Silver has us all on edge.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.285
[sighs] I can see that.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.789
The only thing I can think of is,
back in the day,

26:22.872 --> 26:24.624
Silver had this shady-ass attorney.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.835
This guy was totally off the books.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.338
As a matter of fact,
he did my contract for me.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.592
I mean, what kind of attorney
draws up the paperwork

26:33.675 --> 26:36.595
detailing the terms
of one teenager terrorizing another?

26:36.678 --> 26:38.513
He made you sign a contract?

26:38.597 --> 26:43.226
I made them put it in writing.
The guy did promise me 50% of Cobra Kai.

26:43.810 --> 26:47.230
If people know this contract existed,
Silver's reputation would be destroyed.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.483
They'd never let Cobra Kai compete again.
This is exactly what we need.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.735
Tell me you still have it.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.278
Daniel, no way.

26:53.361 --> 26:57.324
I mean… [sighs] I might be able
to dig up that attorney's name.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.034
[Chozen sighs contentedly]

27:00.160 --> 27:02.537
I see you're liking
that tufted blue suede.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.664
-Mmm. Comfy.
-[Barnes] Mmm.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.166
How much?

27:06.249 --> 27:09.210
Well, it's normally 1,200,
but what the hell?

27:09.294 --> 27:10.211
For you?

27:10.920 --> 27:11.880
Two grand.

27:13.465 --> 27:18.261
Hi, I'm calling in regard
to a former client of yours, Terry Silver.

27:18.345 --> 27:22.182
This is very urgent. Please give me
a call back ASAP when you get this.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.099
Thank you.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.312
I got the lawyer's voicemail.
Hopefully, he calls us back.

27:29.564 --> 27:31.733
Okay. Careful.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.985
Don't get blood on the couch.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.945
-Very expensive.
-[Daniel chuckles]

27:40.617 --> 27:42.911
[gentle music plays]

27:42.994 --> 27:43.828
[Miguel] Hey.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.081
Hey.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.166
Um…

27:49.376 --> 27:53.380
Look, Sam, I owe you an apology.
I shouldn't have abandoned you like that.

27:53.463 --> 27:57.342
I was trying to start a new chapter
and figure out my past.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.679
But I wasn't thinking about you.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.389
Or us.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.849
Uh, even all the way back to prom--

28:04.933 --> 28:05.767
Miguel, you…

28:07.060 --> 28:08.395
You don't need to explain.

28:10.563 --> 28:14.109
I mean, I'm sorry too.
I was only thinking about myself. I…

28:14.192 --> 28:16.027
[gentle music continues]

28:16.111 --> 28:17.696
I was so wrapped up in the tournament.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.031
I wasn't being sensitive
to what you were going through.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.575
As hard as it was
to be on the other side of that…

28:25.745 --> 28:29.165
I really respect you for taking the time
you needed to find yourself.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.793
But

28:33.378 --> 28:35.964
now I need that time too.

28:38.007 --> 28:41.511
Ever since my dad opened the dojo,
my whole life has been about karate.

28:41.594 --> 28:44.305
It-It's affected
all the relationships in my life.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.474
With my family. With my friends.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.269
With you.

28:50.478 --> 28:51.312
I just…

28:51.980 --> 28:53.356
I need a little break

28:53.898 --> 28:56.609
to figure out who I am
outside of all that.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.070
When you say "break," what do you…

29:00.655 --> 29:01.489
What do you mean?

29:02.657 --> 29:04.534
A break from karate?

29:06.244 --> 29:07.287
A break from me?

29:09.664 --> 29:11.040
I'm not okay right now.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.084
[gentle music continues]

29:13.168 --> 29:16.004
I don't think I will be
until I figure this out for myself.

29:18.214 --> 29:20.258
I just need to take the time to do that.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.805
But it doesn't mean
that we can't still be friends.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.976
Just not, uh, boyfriend and girlfriend.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.061
[gentle music continues]

29:35.398 --> 29:37.525
[Sam] I don't even know
if this is what I want.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.404
But… I know it's what I need.

29:42.989 --> 29:43.907
Um…

29:45.992 --> 29:47.160
Look, I understand.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.956
I want what's best for you, always.
You know that.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.042
[gentle music continues]

30:02.801 --> 30:04.844
It doesn't mean
we can't be friends, right?

30:08.389 --> 30:09.224
Promise?

30:11.518 --> 30:12.352
Of course.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.690
So I should, uh, probably get going.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.653
But… call me whenever, okay?

30:22.570 --> 30:23.655
Yeah. [inhales]

30:26.491 --> 30:27.325
Okay.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.410
[gentle music continues]

30:53.351 --> 30:55.353
[gentle music fades]

31:00.233 --> 31:01.067
Johnny…

31:01.860 --> 31:04.195
What's going on?

31:05.238 --> 31:08.825
-You did all this today?
-Yep. Just trying to be prepared.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.326
You know, just in case.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.829
This whole apartment is baby-proofed.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.125
Just try to stick your finger
in any of the sockets. It's a lost cause.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.296
Oh, and did you know
that babies can hear music in the womb?

31:23.506 --> 31:25.800
I adjusted the headphones
to fit around your stomach.

31:27.176 --> 31:30.555
There's Sabbath in there, but you could
put in Metallica, Dokken, whatever.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.931
Metallica. Always.

31:32.515 --> 31:35.685
This morning, I didn't think
I could be one of those lame dads

31:35.768 --> 31:38.438
with the baby carrier,
the diapers, and all that crap.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.690
But if it means I'm doing it with you,

31:41.858 --> 31:42.692
our child,

31:43.276 --> 31:44.611
I'll do whatever it takes.

31:46.529 --> 31:47.447
I know you would.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.742
I can't promise
I won't screw up from time to time.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.286
But I can promise I won't run away.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.371
I won't back down.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.751
I have something to confess.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.003
I couldn't wait. I took the test.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.464
[Johnny exhales deeply]

32:04.547 --> 32:06.758
-Whatever it says, I'm ready.
-[Carmen] Good.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.093
Because…

32:14.474 --> 32:15.850
we're having a baby.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.897
-Badass!
-Yeah?

32:20.980 --> 32:22.106
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

32:22.190 --> 32:24.275
-[Carmen giggles]
-[uplifting music plays]

32:30.323 --> 32:32.200
[uplifting music fades]

32:32.283 --> 32:33.159
[sighs]

32:33.785 --> 32:34.619
Morning.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.206
Nothing like a good steam
to start the day off right.

32:38.831 --> 32:43.586
[Daniel on phone] I'm calling in regard
to a former client of yours, Terry Silver.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.840
This is very urgent. Please give me
a call back ASAP when you get this.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.300
-Thank you.
-[phone beeps]

32:50.635 --> 32:52.637
[tense music plays]

32:54.430 --> 32:55.473
I warned ya.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.979
-What are you doing here?
-[Silver] Oh.

33:02.105 --> 33:05.066
You and I are gonna be seeing
a lot more of each other.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.778
First, I'm gonna deal with my old friend.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.947
[tense music continues]

33:11.781 --> 33:13.199
And then I'll deal with you.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.951
[tense music continues]

33:19.038 --> 33:20.957
I told you not to play with fire.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.835
[tense music intensifies]

33:37.473 --> 33:39.475
[fire crackles]

33:43.980 --> 33:45.982
[sirens wail]

33:52.989 --> 33:53.906
Oh God.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.616
[tense music crescendos]

34:04.042 --> 34:06.961
[theme music plays]
