NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:10.500 --> 00:14.416
GROUNDBREAKING SOON
FOR KOLARÄNGEN SHOPPING MALL

00:14.500 --> 00:17.541
THIS WILL MAKE THE MUNICIPALITY GROW

00:55.416 --> 00:57.916
TODAY'S AGENDA

02:06.083 --> 02:13.083
THE CONFERENCE

02:17.791 --> 02:21.041
All through the town

02:21.125 --> 02:24.708
The doors of the bus
Are opened and shut

02:24.791 --> 02:28.416
Opened and shut

02:28.500 --> 02:31.625
The doors of the bus
Are opened and shut

02:31.708 --> 02:35.416
All through the town

02:35.500 --> 02:39.041
The driver of the bus says
Go back in the bus

02:39.125 --> 02:41.333
Go back in the bus

02:41.416 --> 02:42.875
All through the town

02:42.958 --> 02:44.208
Are we there?

02:44.291 --> 02:47.833
Okay, guys.
We'll be making a short stop soon.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.750
The dad on the bus goes
Hush, hush, hush

02:50.833 --> 02:57.791
All through the town

02:59.333 --> 03:02.833
Okay, guys, it's about to become reality.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.833
Kolarängen shopping mall.

03:05.416 --> 03:08.125
Not bad for a bunch of municipal workers

03:08.208 --> 03:12.000
who just make coffee
and fill out forms all day.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.583
No, joking aside,

03:14.666 --> 03:17.583
tomorrow will be a historic day
for the municipality.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.708
When the ground is broken
in front of the press,

03:20.791 --> 03:24.000
we should be proud
of all the amazing opportunities

03:24.083 --> 03:26.333
that the mall will give Kolarängen.

03:26.416 --> 03:29.875
So, fasten your seatbelts,
'cause here we go!

03:32.916 --> 03:35.583
Now that we've all gathered here,

03:35.666 --> 03:38.375
I'd like to draw attention to the person

03:38.458 --> 03:43.291
who, despite all the difficulties,
has made this project a reality.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.125
And I'm talking about you, Jonas.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.833
The king!

03:49.458 --> 03:50.583
Awesome as hell!

03:51.333 --> 03:53.125
You really fought for this!

03:53.708 --> 03:56.125
Yeah.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.500
Well, being a project manager…

04:02.791 --> 04:04.083
Strange expression.

04:05.291 --> 04:08.333
Project. Manager.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.958
To manage a project…

04:12.666 --> 04:16.583
That's what I've done.
And I couldn't have done it without you.

04:17.083 --> 04:21.583
Especially not without you, Ingela.
Your trust in me has been invaluable.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.958
Thank you, Jonas.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.208
Now let's all enjoy ourselves.

04:25.291 --> 04:28.708
We're going to socialize
and get to know each other better.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.291
And we'll indulge in some luxury.

04:31.375 --> 04:35.083
We're going to combine work and pleasure,
especially pleasure.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.166
Yeah!

04:36.250 --> 04:39.541
If anyone asks, we're here
for "competence development."

04:41.041 --> 04:43.750
It's a requirement
to make it tax-deductible.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.291
-That's right.
-Very important. Thank you.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.291
Kaj?

04:53.916 --> 04:56.333
-Should I take a picture?
-What a journey.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.458
KOLARSJÖN HOLIDAY VILLAGE

05:50.375 --> 05:52.125
Would you look at this bunch!

05:52.208 --> 05:54.958
Hello and welcome
to Kolarsjön Holiday Village!

05:55.041 --> 05:58.708
Hi. I'm Jenny. This is Roger.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.458
If you need anything, ask him. Or me.

06:01.541 --> 06:04.875
Or both of us.
But if your toilet is blocked, ask Roger.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.750
Hi there. Welcome.

06:07.250 --> 06:11.041
This is Cleo. She'll take care of you
during the team-building exercise.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.916
I hope you brought durable clothes,
'cause we're going to have fun!

06:15.000 --> 06:17.166
And here's Karl, our chef.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.458
I hope you brought Imodium.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.125
Nah…

06:22.916 --> 06:24.791
I'm just kidding, of course.

06:24.875 --> 06:29.916
Anyway, we work closely
with our local grocery store…

06:30.000 --> 06:33.375
Who the hell brought fireworks
and put them on my bags?

06:33.458 --> 06:34.666
Those are mine.

06:34.750 --> 06:38.583
-What for?
-Surprise. For the gang, later.

06:38.666 --> 06:43.125
-Okay, so tonight we'll serve a…
-We can go over that later.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.333
Great, Karl.

06:44.416 --> 06:49.416
But now, let's go up to the guesthouse
to get you your cabin keys.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.375
Come with me.

06:51.166 --> 06:54.166
Yeah… Here is the…

06:54.250 --> 06:56.000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.083
Fuck!

06:57.625 --> 06:58.833
Excuse me.

06:58.916 --> 07:03.208
I've just returned to work
after taking some time off, so…

07:04.166 --> 07:05.291
Oh, how nice.

07:05.375 --> 07:10.333
Yeah, and I've been told
to avoid unnecessary stress.

07:10.416 --> 07:12.250
This durable clothes thing…

07:12.333 --> 07:16.333
There'll be no unnecessary stress.
It'll be nice and relaxed and fun.

07:16.916 --> 07:17.875
Don't you worry.

07:17.958 --> 07:19.000
Let's see.

07:19.083 --> 07:22.500
We have Eva and Lina.
You'll share cabin one.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.291
Aren't we a bit too old
for a pajama party? No?

07:25.375 --> 07:28.375
And then we have Jonas and…

07:28.458 --> 07:30.333
Ka-ka-ka-Kajan!

07:30.833 --> 07:32.916
-Yes, cabin number two.
-Número dos.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.125
-Then we have Amir and Torbjörn.
-Congrats, Amir.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.541
-Cabin three.
-Thank you.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.291
Nadja and Anette in four…

07:39.375 --> 07:42.041
Excuse me, who decided
the living arrangements?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.083
You're grouped by astrological signs.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.541
You're a Cancer. You fit with a Scorpio.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.541
-I'm a Scorpio.
-I'm a Cancer.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.708
How exciting! Astrological signs.

07:50.791 --> 07:54.791
That means, Ingela, that you're
by yourself in our luxury cabin.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.541
We're an uneven number,
so someone had to sacrifice themselves.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.916
Look, Anette. This is cultural history.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.583
They weren't afraid
to roll up their sleeves.

08:03.666 --> 08:05.625
-No.
-Look how dirty he is.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.208
Who are these stars?

08:07.291 --> 08:10.416
It's nice that someone is on our side
after all the fuss.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.583
Fuss? More like an uprising.
All the complaints and reports…

08:14.666 --> 08:18.000
I don't think people understand
what this means.

08:18.083 --> 08:22.291
We think the mall will be a boost
for our municipality and for us…

08:22.375 --> 08:24.291
I mean, we've already read this.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.000
-Yeah…
-Why do you think we're here?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.416
Maybe because nobody else wants us.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.750
Roger!

09:07.833 --> 09:09.250
Dammit!

09:16.500 --> 09:20.125
-Where are you going?
-To fill up the gas. It's Roger's job.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.125
Where is he?

09:21.208 --> 09:24.958
In the cabins, finishing up.
But they're having lunch in two hours!

09:30.416 --> 09:35.208
…a petition where the majority
vote against the shopping mall.

09:35.291 --> 09:39.000
But there are no plans
to stop construction,

09:39.083 --> 09:41.041
according to Backmann-Kroon.

09:41.125 --> 09:44.625
Groundbreaking will happen tomorrow,
in front of the press,

09:44.708 --> 09:47.625
with representatives
from the exploitation group…

09:51.916 --> 09:53.375
What the hell?

10:26.916 --> 10:27.916
Damn.

10:30.583 --> 10:32.541
-Sorry.
-What?

10:32.625 --> 10:34.541
Vindaloo, it just…

10:34.625 --> 10:38.750
-Oh. No, it's not you.
-There's no toilet paper, if you're going.

10:38.833 --> 10:42.250
Thanks. It's the cabin.
It smells like old, moldy cardboard.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.000
-Do you smell it?
-This is so damn depressing.

10:45.083 --> 10:49.000
But the standard will be higher
at next year's conference, right?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.541
Beer?

10:50.625 --> 10:55.375
I heard that Backmann-Kroon
flew their entire crew to Dubai last year.

10:55.458 --> 10:59.125
Don't talk too much about that
before it's official.

10:59.916 --> 11:01.083
Okay.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.000
But it will happen, right?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.125
Of course it will.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.208
Did you see today's agenda?

11:19.291 --> 11:22.000
-Environmental goals…
-Will you play guitar, Torbjörn?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.375
Yeah, but it's sold out.

11:23.458 --> 11:27.791
-Guns N' Roses?
-We don't have environmental goals.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.458
You can't have a conference facility
without Wi-Fi.

11:30.541 --> 11:32.541
-No…
-No, you can't.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.375
We do have Wi-Fi.
It's just a bit unstable at times.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.833
We'll sort it out!

11:37.916 --> 11:39.375
-Roger, stop.
-What?

11:39.458 --> 11:41.500
-Go fix the internet.
-Again?

11:41.583 --> 11:43.083
-Yes!
-Is this a joke?

11:43.166 --> 11:44.458
-Hurry, please!
-Yes.

11:49.666 --> 11:51.666
"WE WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT"

11:51.750 --> 11:54.500
KOLARÄNGEN SHOPPING MALL

12:17.333 --> 12:20.291
More and more families
report an increased threat

12:20.375 --> 12:24.750
to the safety we should be able
to take for granted in our society.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.958
In a world characterized
by gang-related crime,

12:28.041 --> 12:31.000
it's difficult to find a place
to call home.

12:34.375 --> 12:39.125
But there is still one municipality that
strives for solidarity and compassion.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.250
A municipality where you can start anew.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.125
-Hi!
-Hey there!

12:45.875 --> 12:50.000
Here, community and neighborliness
are combined with traditional values.

12:50.583 --> 12:51.458
Hey there!

12:52.458 --> 12:53.458
Well, hi there!

12:56.875 --> 13:00.375
If you're young with dreams of becoming
a drainage engineer,

13:00.458 --> 13:04.166
please apply
at our construction high school.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.708
Your imagination is the only limit
to your future.

13:07.791 --> 13:08.625
Yeah!

13:08.708 --> 13:11.375
A municipality to call your home,

13:11.458 --> 13:14.416
your family, your life, your work,

13:14.500 --> 13:17.958
or simply Kolarängen.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.375
Welcome home!

13:25.833 --> 13:30.708
"Welcome home."
A little inspiration to kick off the day.

13:32.541 --> 13:35.208
Was I the only one who got goosebumps?

13:39.500 --> 13:43.250
I'm sorry,
but did Nordfront make that movie?

13:43.333 --> 13:45.625
There are white gang members there, too.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.916
-Is everyone in Kolarängen white?
-Not in real life.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.791
But this wasn't real life.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.541
A bouquet of flowers
doesn't just consist of… of roses.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.250
It's all kinds of flowers.
And all the flowers need to bloom.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.875
Hey, Ingela… I have to ask you something.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.875
What channel will air this crap?

14:03.958 --> 14:07.166
Torbjörn, we're not airing it
on a regular TV channel.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.208
-No?
-We'll upload it to YouTube.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.833
How the hell can we waste resources
on these things?

14:12.916 --> 14:15.708
I mean, back in my day, we handed out--

14:15.791 --> 14:18.125
Everything was better back in your day.

14:18.208 --> 14:21.416
You and the other men
could read porno mags in the break room

14:21.500 --> 14:23.583
and eat liver pâté from the box.

14:23.666 --> 14:26.666
Seriously,
I think we should consider if this

14:26.750 --> 14:29.166
is really how we want to sell Kolarängen.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.125
No, but perhaps
we could just shorten it a bit?

14:33.375 --> 14:37.541
Just remove the beginning,
the middle and the end.

14:38.958 --> 14:42.583
You're so funny, you guys.
You're so incredibly funny.

14:42.666 --> 14:46.625
But how about you finish
one of your work tasks for once?

14:46.708 --> 14:49.125
Everything you do just comes to nothing.

14:49.875 --> 14:53.333
What about the invitations
for the ceremony tomorrow?

14:53.416 --> 14:57.291
You were supposed to handle it.
Did that also come to nothing?

15:05.208 --> 15:10.708
Now, how about we all sing
"We Shall Overcome"?

15:11.500 --> 15:15.708
No, but perhaps a little break
to gather some energy?

15:18.708 --> 15:21.750
-There's coffee in the lobby!
-We can't accept this.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.000
-Coffee!
-Can you grab me a cup, Eva?

15:24.083 --> 15:25.083
Yes.

15:30.875 --> 15:31.958
That's great, Anette.

16:09.833 --> 16:13.291
We got, what was it,
15 million for the land.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.708
All the big chains will be there.

16:16.458 --> 16:19.583
I got Backmann-Kroon
to keep the rents down

16:19.666 --> 16:22.666
so local entrepreneurs
can get established in Kolarängen.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.458
What large chains are coming?

16:24.541 --> 16:28.541
A small furniture store that makes you
put together your own shelves.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.500
-IKEA.
-We don't talk about that.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.125
-Hey!
-Hi.

16:33.208 --> 16:37.125
Hi. How does it feel to be back?
Did you miss us?

16:38.041 --> 16:39.500
I missed you, of course.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.541
I don't know about the rest.

16:45.541 --> 16:46.666
No!

16:48.208 --> 16:52.541
I really regret not sticking up for you
more before you went on sick leave.

16:53.625 --> 16:58.250
I saw how overworked you were,
so I really wanted to talk to Ingela, but…

16:58.333 --> 17:00.791
-It just…
-It's okay.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.000
She wouldn't have listened anyway.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.958
Okay, guys, let's continue.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.625
Everyone's sharp after some caffeine.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.000
Now, you youngsters…

17:16.583 --> 17:19.500
Okay! Let's go!

17:22.916 --> 17:26.625
Hi, Karl here! Call or leave a message…

17:26.708 --> 17:30.250
Since we'll have so many new residents
in the municipality…

17:30.333 --> 17:33.500
-What about my bus route proposal?
-Let's deal with that later.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.208
Did you even present it?

17:35.291 --> 17:39.208
I have presented your proposal.
It's been presented, thank you.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.625
I can't see anything
about the actual costs here.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.666
It sure must have cost a pretty penny.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.541
I'm just saying, blueprints aren't free.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.250
And building the road,
and the water and sewage…

17:51.333 --> 17:54.541
Wait!

17:57.041 --> 18:01.125
Of course it costs money
to invest in the future, right?

18:06.833 --> 18:10.125
But the land is worth more
than what you sold it for.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.708
Nadja, I've gone through the numbers
multiple times. They add up.

18:13.791 --> 18:17.958
-Exactly, there's nothing more to discuss.
-But the mall hasn't been built yet.

18:18.041 --> 18:21.541
But we're breaking ground tomorrow, dear.
Tomorrow!

18:21.625 --> 18:23.458
In front of the entire press corps.

18:24.166 --> 18:28.208
-You haven't worked with us for that long.
-No. So?

18:28.291 --> 18:31.500
So you may not be familiar
with how we do things here.

18:31.583 --> 18:34.041
Jonas has everything under control.

18:39.125 --> 18:43.500
-Nadja, can I have a peek at that?
-Sure. I'll be quiet.

18:43.583 --> 18:47.750
With an increase in population,
we're facing

18:47.833 --> 18:50.833
an interesting situation
regarding housing…

18:50.916 --> 18:53.791
Hold on. I don't recognize this, either.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.666
Oh God, I can't take any more.

18:55.750 --> 19:01.000
But where is the compensation agreement
for the farmer and his family, Pålsson?

19:03.416 --> 19:07.125
We demolished his whole farm.
They have to be compensated.

19:07.208 --> 19:11.791
Lina, we went through all of this
in the spring.

19:13.541 --> 19:14.458
We did?

19:14.541 --> 19:16.458
You signed the contracts.

19:16.541 --> 19:20.250
Sure, it's my signature,
but it's the wrong contract.

19:20.333 --> 19:24.500
-I wouldn't have signed this.
-So who signed it if you didn't?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.916
Yet again with the speculations.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.208
All these speculations.
We're supposed to be a team!

19:30.291 --> 19:33.583
We can't question every little thing
if we're to make progress.

19:33.666 --> 19:37.833
Do you remember what happened last time
we argued about petty things?

19:37.916 --> 19:39.208
What happened?

19:46.666 --> 19:47.958
Hey, Frans…

19:48.791 --> 19:49.625
Frasse!

19:50.208 --> 19:51.375
I was attacked.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.041
Tearing down a family farm to build a mall

19:54.125 --> 19:55.875
is no petty thing, is it?

19:55.958 --> 19:58.208
It's capitalist depravity.

19:58.291 --> 20:02.750
The shopping mall is part of
the municipality's welfare structure.

20:02.833 --> 20:06.916
Listen, you have to break a few eggs

20:07.000 --> 20:09.125
to make a pancake.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.375
-Omelet.
-Right?

20:11.458 --> 20:15.541
-What do you mean?
-Pancake. I heard the word "pancake."

20:15.625 --> 20:16.791
Let's have lunch.

20:40.666 --> 20:42.375
Hot dogs?

20:42.458 --> 20:44.833
Is that all we get for lunch?

20:44.916 --> 20:48.833
Yeah, we've had some issues
with our food deliveries. Here you go.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.625
I thought we were having salmon.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.458
Damn, this hot dog is cold. Stone cold.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.000
Lina?

21:25.166 --> 21:26.125
Lina?

21:27.083 --> 21:28.875
-Hi.
-God, you scared me.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.416
How are you?

21:30.500 --> 21:33.125
Yeah, I'm… I'm fine.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Can we just have a quick word?

21:39.250 --> 21:40.791
-Sure.
-Cool.

21:42.541 --> 21:43.750
What are you doing?

21:45.333 --> 21:46.375
What do you mean?

21:46.458 --> 21:50.791
You're questioning the contracts
in front of everyone.

21:50.875 --> 21:53.250
Can't you see it's embarrassing for me?

21:53.333 --> 21:56.833
Like I did something wrong?
And Ingela gets nervous as hell.

21:56.916 --> 22:00.625
I just think it feels really difficult.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.291
Okay, but I just told you what I saw.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.958
-I didn't sign those contracts, Jonas.
-No.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.666
-I don't recognize them at all.
-So who did?

22:10.750 --> 22:13.541
Was it… the Little Ghost Godfrey, maybe?

22:14.041 --> 22:17.666
Or maybe you don't remember?
Is that possible?

22:17.750 --> 22:20.750
It's normal for your memory to fail a bit

22:20.833 --> 22:23.375
when you've been stressed for a long time.

22:23.458 --> 22:26.250
You start to disassociate
and fabricate things…

22:26.333 --> 22:28.875
Think about what you say from now on.
Okay?

22:35.416 --> 22:36.458
Yes?

22:36.541 --> 22:38.958
We're out of crap paper in cabin two.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.291
-We'll sort that out. No worries.
-Yup…

22:58.625 --> 23:02.375
-So, where's the chef?
-He's preparing food, or dinner.

23:02.458 --> 23:05.750
My main question is, really,
who has done the pricing…

23:05.833 --> 23:09.458
All your questions are starting to feel
like the Nuremberg Trials.

23:09.541 --> 23:14.000
But I have to be able to question things.
Aren't we here to discuss?

23:14.083 --> 23:16.750
You have to be able to discuss it
the right way.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.750
The last thing we want
is another Frans situation.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.083
Who's Frans?

23:24.375 --> 23:25.583
Frans? Who's Frans?

23:28.666 --> 23:30.208
Did I miss something?

24:52.625 --> 24:55.708
This is such a goddamn farce.

24:56.250 --> 24:59.166
Remember back in the day, Eva,
when municipal workers

24:59.250 --> 25:02.375
cared about farmlands
and understood their worth?

25:02.458 --> 25:03.541
Do you understand?

25:07.083 --> 25:10.250
-Look, Anette.
-What the hell is this?

25:10.333 --> 25:13.916
Yeah, I think he's supposed to be
a charcoal burner.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.166
Howdy, gang!

25:18.291 --> 25:20.291
Well, I'm Sooty!

25:20.375 --> 25:25.000
Yes, I'm here to inaugurate
a shopping mall here in Kolarängen.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.708
We're going to have so much fun!

25:28.791 --> 25:33.125
Does anyone happen to have seen
a little shopping mall

25:33.208 --> 25:37.666
that's ready to be inaugurated?

25:39.166 --> 25:42.458
It's Sooty! Kolarängen's very own mascot.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.916
What's a charcoal burner?

25:44.000 --> 25:48.291
They were the proletarians of the forest
and supplied the furnaces with coal.

25:48.375 --> 25:51.541
The land we're now ravaging
to build malls on.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.291
Give me a break, Anette.

25:53.375 --> 25:56.583
Our municipality has the country's
most ambitious climate goals!

25:56.666 --> 26:00.791
Do you know the difference
between climate and environmental goals?

26:00.875 --> 26:03.500
-Don't bring politics into everything.
-Tell me.

26:03.583 --> 26:06.291
If we are going on to bring in politics…

26:06.375 --> 26:08.083
Someone's trying to make…

26:08.166 --> 26:09.625
She does have a point.

26:09.708 --> 26:13.166
Hey!

26:14.791 --> 26:17.250
What is this goddamn attitude?

26:17.916 --> 26:20.833
When I make an effort,
dress up and put on a show?

26:21.916 --> 26:23.000
Entertainment.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.708
I only have one thing to say:
pearls before swine.

26:37.708 --> 26:38.916
Are you happy now?

27:00.250 --> 27:02.166
There's cottage cheese pie and jam.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.833
Don't worry about
what the others think and feel.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.041
I… I don't care.

27:13.333 --> 27:14.833
I feel sorry for them.

27:15.916 --> 27:16.958
I do.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.416
They have no humor.

27:20.291 --> 27:23.833
What will happen to them, I wonder,
without creativity, "visionarity…"

27:23.916 --> 27:25.291
Jonas, listen to me.

27:25.375 --> 27:29.041
Those who truly mean something
know what you've accomplished.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.208
And that's what's important.

27:33.166 --> 27:36.375
People can't stand it when someone is…

27:37.166 --> 27:41.875
When someone is as successful
and young and visionary as you.

27:42.625 --> 27:45.333
They can't handle it. And you know what?

27:50.083 --> 27:54.875
That's why I've decided to let you get
the first crack at the shovel tomorrow.

27:55.416 --> 27:56.250
You.

28:25.916 --> 28:27.083
Try it, Jonas.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.041
Shovel.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.375
Try shoveling a bit.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.958
Just like that. Great.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.625
That way. Like so.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.500
A bit stronger.

28:49.333 --> 28:52.666
A strong team is the foundation
of a successful organization,

28:52.750 --> 28:56.083
so through communication and cooperation

28:56.166 --> 28:59.291
we will understand each other better.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.083
Exactly right!

29:04.708 --> 29:07.625
That's so fucking well said, Ingela.
Like this…

29:16.125 --> 29:20.041
And by communication,
I mean real communication.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.000
Conversations, human interaction.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.583
So that means no cell phones.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.458
You have a lovely Christian energy.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.125
So we can spend some time
together with our bodies.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.583
Great. Put it in here.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.208
Good. Really great.

29:38.291 --> 29:42.791
We'll take that, and you can smoke
when you're back home and not here.

29:42.875 --> 29:45.625
That's lovely.
You'll get to listen to me for a while.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.666
Hey, such lovely energy!

29:47.750 --> 29:51.666
And now I want all of you
to run back to your cabins

29:51.750 --> 29:54.375
and change into durable clothes,

29:54.458 --> 29:56.666
because now it's team-building time!

29:58.833 --> 30:03.375
-I've made a quiz with topical questions.
-We won't have time for that.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.833
-Amir.
-Yeah?

30:06.208 --> 30:08.416
-You believe me, right?
-Yes, what?

30:10.291 --> 30:14.083
-I didn't sign those documents.
-Okay. So who did?

30:15.208 --> 30:16.583
I don't know, but…

30:17.458 --> 30:20.625
We have to compensate the farmer.
It would be mad not to.

30:20.708 --> 30:23.375
-How?
-We'll have to squeeze it into the budget.

30:23.458 --> 30:27.125
-We'll have to contact him.
-Contact who? Pålsson?

30:27.208 --> 30:28.125
Yeah.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.583
But Lina…

30:32.333 --> 30:33.541
Pålsson is dead.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.916
Didn't you know?

30:36.083 --> 30:37.333
What? When did he die?

30:37.416 --> 30:39.500
After they demolished the farm.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.166
He killed himself.

30:48.041 --> 30:48.916
Shit.

30:50.333 --> 30:55.000
Ingela doesn't want us talking about it,
because of the "negative connotations."

30:56.333 --> 30:57.458
Of course.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.208
Each team will build a raft!

31:02.291 --> 31:06.625
At your disposal you have two pallets,

31:06.708 --> 31:10.875
sixty PET bottles, two rolls of duct tape,

31:10.958 --> 31:12.458
all your power animals

31:12.541 --> 31:16.750
and a large bag of fighting spirit.
Let's go!

31:21.166 --> 31:22.916
I'll start with the bags!

31:23.541 --> 31:24.958
Tape it!

31:27.916 --> 31:28.833
Torbjörn!

31:28.916 --> 31:29.958
Bottles!

31:30.041 --> 31:33.250
-Let me tape the bottles!
-And a shitload of tape!

31:36.291 --> 31:39.291
-Jonas? Hello, do you hear me?
-Yes.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.541
Come on, red team!

31:46.041 --> 31:48.416
Hey, put those on the side. Tape it!

31:51.500 --> 31:53.916
Come on! Screw that! Carry!

31:54.000 --> 31:55.125
Come on!

31:56.500 --> 31:57.833
The boys go!

32:11.916 --> 32:12.750
Paddle!

32:16.250 --> 32:17.833
This is so goddamn stupid.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.875
-We won, Anette!
-Yeah, great.

32:24.958 --> 32:27.541
-To hell with this.
-We won!

32:27.625 --> 32:30.750
-Come on, let's have a beer.
-Brown team!

33:03.208 --> 33:04.125
Roger?

33:05.083 --> 33:06.166
Karl?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.375
Cleo?

33:08.458 --> 33:09.416
Hello!

33:12.041 --> 33:13.250
Roger?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.125
What the…

33:16.791 --> 33:17.666
God…

33:31.416 --> 33:33.708
What the fuck is this?

33:35.791 --> 33:36.708
Oh, God…

34:00.500 --> 34:01.625
Jump!

34:01.708 --> 34:06.666
Jonas!

35:04.916 --> 35:07.708
You are on a sinking ship.

35:08.250 --> 35:11.125
You have been given a list of things.

35:12.458 --> 35:16.958
During a limited time, you need to make
a joint decision as a team

35:17.041 --> 35:20.416
about which of the things on this list
you will save.

35:22.375 --> 35:26.000
You'll have to prioritize and compromise
under time pressure,

35:26.083 --> 35:27.833
which generates stress.

35:28.958 --> 35:32.791
Try to find a method
to deal with that stress.

35:33.416 --> 35:35.291
You have one minute.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.416
Okay.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.583
Toilet paper seems very important.
That's a given.

35:40.666 --> 35:44.875
But cans of food, they're hard work,
so maybe we can ditch them?

35:44.958 --> 35:46.583
Then what will you eat?

35:47.166 --> 35:49.583
I can drink myself full. I'm good at that.

35:49.666 --> 35:51.083
Yeah, me too.

35:51.166 --> 35:52.416
The laptop is coming.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.125
So you'll swim
with a laptop under your arm?

35:56.250 --> 35:58.375
Why's the laptop so important?

35:58.458 --> 36:03.041
Well, Lina, everyone's different,
but for me, it's extremely important.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.625
So you'd rather bring a laptop
than a life jacket?

36:06.208 --> 36:10.083
Yes, I know how to swim,
but I can't recover hard drives.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.166
Can't I recover the hard drives?

36:12.250 --> 36:14.916
Yes, but no… Amir!
The laptop is coming right away!

36:15.000 --> 36:17.250
But Jonas,
you can pull out the hard drive.

36:17.333 --> 36:20.500
Let him take his laptop!
As long as I get a bottle of wine.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.083
But it's all about
what matters to oneself.

36:23.166 --> 36:25.500
If the laptop is important for Jonas…

36:25.583 --> 36:28.250
Seven, six, five…

36:29.458 --> 36:32.000
But guys!

36:32.083 --> 36:33.583
Guys! Quiet!

36:35.666 --> 36:40.083
How are we going to handle the oil spill
that happens when the boat sinks?

36:40.166 --> 36:42.916
You're analyzing this task wrong!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.458
Ring the gong!

36:49.333 --> 36:52.583
THE HOLIDAY VILLAGE
WELCOMES THE SHOPPING MALL

36:58.708 --> 37:00.875
…Costa Rica, in the jungle.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.750
It was awesome as hell.

37:08.416 --> 37:09.333
Watch this!

37:14.625 --> 37:16.250
-Go, Jonas!
-You can't keep up?

37:16.750 --> 37:18.291
You have awesome thighs!

37:22.291 --> 37:24.791
-Are you ready for the baptism of fire?
-Yes!

37:26.750 --> 37:28.291
Do we have a volunteer?

37:30.291 --> 37:31.375
You, over there.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.708
Up for it?

37:33.333 --> 37:36.041
There won't be any stress.
It's just for fun.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.666
Isn't it time to rip the band-aid off?
Just do it.

37:39.250 --> 37:43.750
We're here to challenge ourselves.
To step out into the unknown.

37:47.291 --> 37:53.291
Lina!

37:53.375 --> 37:57.666
Lina!

37:57.750 --> 38:00.916
Hey, guys.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.083
You guys…

38:02.625 --> 38:03.750
Not like that.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.958
It's great that you want
to encourage Lina, really.

38:09.125 --> 38:12.500
But we know how fragile she is right now.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.875
It's no damn picnic.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.791
So if she's scared to…

38:21.958 --> 38:25.375
If she doesn't want to,
she doesn't need to.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.916
There is no shame in giving up.

38:41.708 --> 38:44.500
-Sometimes you win by giving up.
-No, I…

38:45.250 --> 38:46.083
I'll go.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.250
No, Kaj.

38:49.083 --> 38:50.625
That's not the way to go.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.375
Come on.

39:01.916 --> 39:03.708
Yeah, no… I don't want to.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.291
I do want to remind all of you,

39:10.375 --> 39:13.750
that this is the stuff
that makes you grow as a person.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.791
We're here to have fun, you know.

39:16.875 --> 39:20.208
So Cleo, I'm thinking about…

39:20.291 --> 39:23.583
How often are these facilities inspected?

39:25.125 --> 39:27.166
I've heard that these wires…

40:39.000 --> 40:43.958
Back in my day, we went on conferences
to get a break from our daily routine,

40:44.041 --> 40:48.333
and we went on conferences
to eat good food and drink beer.

40:48.416 --> 40:50.500
That sounds a bit backwards, doesn't it?

40:50.583 --> 40:52.625
I'm hearing disagreement in the group,

40:52.708 --> 40:57.583
so let me say that honest disagreement
is often a sign of development.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.958
-Who do you think said that?
-Phil Collins.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.208
Tony Robbins.

41:01.291 --> 41:03.416
Great guesses, everyone.

41:03.500 --> 41:06.916
But it was in fact Mahatma Gandhi.
What did he mean by that?

41:09.375 --> 41:12.291
No, he meant that respectful disagreement

41:12.375 --> 41:13.541
between two people

41:13.625 --> 41:16.750
is a way to reach success
in any path of life.

41:16.833 --> 41:18.500
Damn well said.

41:25.708 --> 41:27.500
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
BACKMANN-KROON

41:30.458 --> 41:31.916
ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT

41:35.125 --> 41:36.875
A PROFITABLE DEAL FOR YOU

41:36.958 --> 41:39.791
THE LAND WILL BE WORTH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

41:41.375 --> 41:42.833
Got you, bastard.

41:46.541 --> 41:48.083
Hey, guys.

41:48.166 --> 41:51.583
It's about damn time
we took a group photo.

41:51.666 --> 41:52.833
I need content.

41:58.625 --> 42:01.500
-Cleo, can we have our phones back?
-Yeah.

42:01.583 --> 42:05.708
Okay, so the taller people in the back,
and the shorter ones here.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.625
Let's bunch up a little.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.125
-Cleo?
-Yeah, no…

42:09.208 --> 42:13.708
Let's wait until the withdrawal
wears off completely.

42:13.791 --> 42:14.750
What?

42:14.833 --> 42:17.791
You can talk to each other instead.

42:17.875 --> 42:21.250
Why don't you analyze your disagreements,
and I'll…

42:21.333 --> 42:23.666
-Where's my head?
-What's going on?

42:26.958 --> 42:29.208
Bro, see you at the hot tub, hey?

42:31.166 --> 42:34.833
-Hey! Where the fuck is my head?
-Is that a trick question, or what?

42:34.916 --> 42:37.458
-It's there, between your shoulders.
-Funny.

42:37.541 --> 42:40.958
-I brought a huge fucking head.
-No, I haven't seen it.

42:46.875 --> 42:48.166
…this bullshit.

42:51.666 --> 42:54.541
"It's between your shoulders." Yes, it is.

42:54.625 --> 42:58.666
My head is between my shoulders.
Where the hell is yours? Up your ass?

42:58.750 --> 43:00.166
I should have said that.

43:03.166 --> 43:04.583
Whatever.

43:14.041 --> 43:16.291
Fuck you.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.666
No, it's fine.

44:14.875 --> 44:15.958
Wow!

44:18.458 --> 44:21.458
I spent two days
creating a playlist on my phone

44:21.541 --> 44:25.416
for this exact occasion.
It's so goddamn annoying.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.875
They'll probably want to see
who goes mad first without their phone.

44:29.958 --> 44:34.125
I think it'll be Kaj, actually.
What if your 12 followers on Instagram

44:34.208 --> 44:38.000
can't experience
this exciting life of yours?

44:38.083 --> 44:39.500
Hashtag YOLO.

44:39.583 --> 44:43.791
-Haha, Eva. But I have 83 followers.
-Okay.

44:43.875 --> 44:47.416
Besides, no one even says "YOLO" anymore,
so you fail again.

44:48.416 --> 44:50.541
-Oh, wow…
-Oh, Ledin!

44:51.125 --> 44:57.083
A part of my heart
Will always beat for you

44:59.000 --> 45:00.333
YOLO!

45:02.625 --> 45:03.458
YOLO.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.583
-Cheers!
-Cheers to you!

45:14.083 --> 45:15.416
And cheers to us, guys!

45:16.000 --> 45:16.875
Jenny?

45:19.875 --> 45:20.875
Roger?

45:23.250 --> 45:24.291
Karl?

45:26.041 --> 45:26.875
Damn it!

45:28.791 --> 45:30.291
What the…

45:32.958 --> 45:34.083
Hello?

46:47.083 --> 46:49.708
Oh my God…

47:01.666 --> 47:03.041
Pour!

47:05.541 --> 47:07.416
A little flower!

47:11.250 --> 47:13.958
Dear friends,
I'd like to pause to reflect on…

47:14.666 --> 47:18.500
…this day we've had together.

47:19.958 --> 47:22.208
It's been a breathtaking day.

47:22.875 --> 47:26.291
We've all opened up to each other
and taken off our masks,

47:26.375 --> 47:30.291
and together we become who we really are.

47:31.750 --> 47:34.791
You've opened up your hearts
to each other.

47:34.875 --> 47:37.541
-I need the bathroom. Amir!
-Your masks…

47:38.875 --> 47:42.583
This new opening
gives us the chance to do wonders.

47:42.666 --> 47:43.500
Yes.

47:43.583 --> 47:46.333
Tomorrow will be
an absolutely fantastic day.

47:46.833 --> 47:48.833
Because now, we're all so close.

47:48.916 --> 47:51.208
Feel! Our skin is touching.

47:51.708 --> 47:53.041
Hey, Ingela?

47:54.958 --> 47:57.458
That scar, can you still feel it?

47:57.541 --> 47:59.708
I mean, physically, I don't feel it.

47:59.791 --> 48:03.500
But you have to understand,
mentally, being attacked like that…

48:03.583 --> 48:04.625
It's so hurtful.

48:04.708 --> 48:07.500
That a co-worker can attack you like that…

48:07.583 --> 48:10.000
You have to be able to feel safe at work.

48:10.083 --> 48:12.916
-Right now we are.
-It doesn't go away.

48:13.000 --> 48:13.958
No.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.583
I went through Jonas' computer.

48:16.666 --> 48:18.875
The compensation agreements,
the land sale,

48:18.958 --> 48:21.958
the e-mails between Jonas,
Backmann-Kroon, and Kaj…

48:22.041 --> 48:24.291
-Something's off here.
-Let me see.

48:25.375 --> 48:29.041
All my documents are dated
a week before I went on sick leave.

48:29.125 --> 48:30.000
Okay?

48:30.083 --> 48:34.375
But the contracts they used were created
a month before they were signed.

48:34.458 --> 48:36.458
So they backdated the contracts?

48:37.041 --> 48:39.916
Apparently, and forged my signature.

48:40.875 --> 48:41.708
No…

48:42.625 --> 48:43.916
-One more thing.
-What?

48:44.000 --> 48:47.833
There are no contracts with any chains.
No one's interested.

48:47.916 --> 48:50.625
What about IKEA?
They're taking the big premises.

48:51.208 --> 48:56.000
No. And when the shit hits the fan,
Jonas will be working for Backmann-Kroon.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.791
There's a contract.

48:59.833 --> 49:01.000
It's all here.

49:04.625 --> 49:07.333
No, dammit,
my stomach is starting to rumble.

49:07.416 --> 49:10.583
-Do you know what time it is, Eva?
-The time is…

49:13.958 --> 49:16.208
-It's 7 p.m.
-It's 7 already?

49:16.291 --> 49:18.458
Christ, they're an hour late.

49:18.541 --> 49:21.958
Why can't they stick to the schedule
at this goddamn place?

49:22.041 --> 49:24.416
It's freezing.
Do you want to come to my cabin?

49:24.500 --> 49:26.541
Well, do you have anything to eat?

49:26.625 --> 49:27.791
Potato chips, red wine.

49:28.958 --> 49:30.125
Deal.

49:37.125 --> 49:39.708
-The Wolf of Wall Street.
-What a great film.

49:40.375 --> 49:41.500
You need an ISK.

49:41.583 --> 49:44.333
ISK? Isk? Isk's the thing.

49:44.416 --> 49:48.750
But if you really mean business,
you'll go with a crypto wallet.

49:49.458 --> 49:50.291
Damn.

49:50.375 --> 49:52.708
Did you get Kaj to forge my signature?

49:52.791 --> 49:54.125
You're good at that.

49:54.208 --> 49:56.208
Letting others do your dirty work.

49:56.291 --> 49:57.625
Whoa.

49:58.458 --> 50:01.291
Hold your horses.
What are you talking about?

50:01.375 --> 50:03.166
Yeah, what are you talking about?

50:03.250 --> 50:05.833
Did Backmann-Kroon offer you a job, too?

50:06.375 --> 50:08.875
A pay raise and conference trips to Dubai?

50:09.416 --> 50:11.541
That's not official, is it?

50:12.666 --> 50:14.333
You know… Lina, damn it…

50:14.416 --> 50:15.833
I know what you've done.

50:17.875 --> 50:19.083
IKEA's not coming.

50:20.375 --> 50:21.583
No one's coming.

50:35.666 --> 50:37.666
Can you and I talk in private?

50:46.375 --> 50:50.333
-Bro, you want me to tag along?
-No, hell no. I've got this.

50:50.416 --> 50:53.291
You just sit there and enjoy. Enjoy!

51:00.958 --> 51:03.583
Now I see why you gave me
all that extra work.

51:04.333 --> 51:08.500
You had Ingela give me a lot
of unnecessary tasks to distract me.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.708
And then you used my sick leave

51:10.791 --> 51:13.208
to make everyone believe
that I was in the wrong.

51:13.291 --> 51:14.333
Lina…

51:16.375 --> 51:17.666
Look at me.

51:19.458 --> 51:20.416
I like you.

51:22.125 --> 51:24.708
Because you're smart. Up here.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
But I'm wondering,
what are you really doing here?

51:30.083 --> 51:32.416
You shouldn't be here,
you should be there.

51:33.708 --> 51:37.625
You belong
on a much larger playing field, Lina.

51:41.791 --> 51:44.458
This just hit me,
and it has to stay between us…

51:46.291 --> 51:49.291
but I happen to know
that Backmann-Kroon are hiring.

51:52.708 --> 51:56.666
In my position,
I could get you a sweet job over there.

51:58.541 --> 51:59.958
With a great salary.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
One where you'd actually be happy.

52:06.625 --> 52:10.750
And we'll forget this bullshit.
What do you think?

52:21.583 --> 52:22.416
No…

52:23.958 --> 52:25.166
Screw that, then.

52:29.666 --> 52:32.458
Why are you saying that IKEA's not coming?

52:33.791 --> 52:35.791
-Well, are they?
-Yes, they are.

52:36.750 --> 52:39.750
But they'll come in their own time.

52:41.250 --> 52:44.333
And I don't need someone who…
walks around like this.

52:44.416 --> 52:48.041
We're here because of me!
Did you forget that? It's mine!

52:48.125 --> 52:51.375
I'm under so much pressure.
I'm digging tomorrow, with the shovel!

52:51.458 --> 52:52.416
Do you get that?

52:52.500 --> 52:55.333
I'll stand in front of the press and dig!

52:58.083 --> 53:00.250
There'll be no revenue. No tourists.

53:00.333 --> 53:02.416
The mall will be a fiasco.

53:03.375 --> 53:05.416
The municipality will go bankrupt.

53:09.250 --> 53:11.416
Where the hell are you getting this from?

53:14.625 --> 53:16.625
Your extremely valuable laptop.

53:28.708 --> 53:33.500
You're way out of your depth now, Lina.
You know that, right?

53:36.041 --> 53:38.750
Either you come clean
and stop the construction

53:40.291 --> 53:42.416
or I'm taking this to the police.

53:56.708 --> 53:58.416
Damn, I love this song.

53:59.083 --> 54:00.791
Anette, turn up the volume.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.833
-Anette?
-What?

54:03.916 --> 54:06.875
Turn up the volume!
This song means a lot to me.

55:11.041 --> 55:13.583
What kind of shitty song is this?

55:22.208 --> 55:24.250
No, it's getting late.

55:30.458 --> 55:32.291
And here comes that one.

55:36.541 --> 55:39.625
Hey, Sooty! Bro!

55:41.833 --> 55:43.041
Hey, Sooty, my man!

55:44.375 --> 55:47.750
It's cool, I'm just paranoid
about this Lina stuff and…

55:47.833 --> 55:49.791
What are you doing with that? What?

56:40.333 --> 56:42.541
Hello! Jenny?

56:43.333 --> 56:46.208
We're starting to get hungry here. Hello?

57:19.708 --> 57:24.166
Dear God…
True and righteous are Your Judgments.

57:31.750 --> 57:33.208
Jonas!

58:04.833 --> 58:08.208
Are you seeing this?
He's fucking hanging her up!

58:08.291 --> 58:09.458
Who's that?

58:10.375 --> 58:11.625
Sooty? What?

58:13.958 --> 58:16.250
Run, Lina!

58:16.833 --> 58:19.208
Run!

58:40.500 --> 58:42.250
Get up!

58:45.125 --> 58:47.166
What the fuck is going on?

58:47.250 --> 58:49.208
The police. Call the police!

58:54.166 --> 58:56.083
Hello? It's fucking dead!

58:58.250 --> 58:59.500
What should we do?

59:00.208 --> 59:01.875
The raft. Come on, the raft!

59:04.250 --> 59:05.083
Ow!

59:07.416 --> 59:08.375
Lift!

59:10.666 --> 59:12.791
Dammit! I'll go first!

59:16.791 --> 59:18.583
-Oh my God…
-Damn it!

59:18.666 --> 59:20.625
There's blood everywhere.

59:22.041 --> 59:25.666
Eva! Let's calm down, Eva.
Everything will be just fine…

59:25.750 --> 59:27.500
Let go of me!

59:50.375 --> 59:51.708
Fuck…

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.875
What sick bastard has done this?

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:11.875
It's that goddamn Frans
from the environmental office.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.750
What are you doing?

01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:36.333
Keep paddling!

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:39.208
The flash drive.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:42.333
-What?
-Give it to me.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:48.125
And we'll go ashore, call the police
and forget our old grudges, okay?

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:53.083
Give it to me.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.125
Give it to me!

01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:04.291
You're out of your mind.

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.625
If only you'd listened to me, Lina!

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:24.833
What a fucking team
we could have been, huh?

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:29.625
Such a fucking good
little fucking girl, aren't you?

01:01:29.708 --> 01:01:32.083
Why the fuck is everyone against me?

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.458
Let's see.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.791
Let's inhale through our nose
and exhale through our mouth.

01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:40.833
We're on a sinking ship.

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:44.791
What do you need to survive
on a sinking ship?

01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:46.416
What things do you need?

01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:52.833
Okay.

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.291
I think you need to…

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.333
-For fuck's sake, Amir!
-You have to…

01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:04.333
Quit nagging me, goddamn it!
I know these things.

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.250
-Yes.
-There.

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.041
Do you see anything?

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:11.666
No.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:15.416
Hey, listen up.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:18.375
We need to come up
with a damn good strategy.

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:20.333
-The minivan.
-What about it?

01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.583
-The minivan.
-Yes?

01:03:21.666 --> 01:03:24.875
-Jonas has the keys…
-You can't go to the minivan, please!

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:29.041
I'm not leaving this house.
I'm not taking a step from here.

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:31.291
How can it be so damn hard to understand?

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:34.375
-Are you choosing Jonas' cabin or death?
-I'm staying here!

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.666
-Torbjörn?
-Yeah. No.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:38.375
You're unbelievable.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.583
-Nadja!
-Nadja!

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:42.541
Hush!

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:45.458
-And Amir, where the hell is Amir?
-Huh?

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.416
What the hell?

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:50.583
Lina?

01:04:08.125 --> 01:04:09.041
Lina!

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.083
Lina!

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.958
Ouch! Damn it!

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.208
Lina?

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.708
Turn off the light.

01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.666
-Did you see him?
-Is he out there?

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:02.125
-No!
-No…

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500
No!

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:08.291
Fuck! No.

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.333
Fuck…

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:27.208
No…

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.875
No! Someone's here.

01:07:02.666 --> 01:07:04.208
Calm down! It's us!

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:03.291
This is insane.

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:05.833
Listen… Listen, all of you.

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:09.083
From now on, we stick together.
We all stick together, okay?

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.208
Oh dear God…

01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:14.958
What is it?

01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:17.791
Anette…

01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.666
Who was that with the mask and…

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.583
Little Kaj!

01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:09.333
Did you see what happened to Kaj?

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:12.041
He just laid there like…

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:15.416
Kaj… There was so much… It was horrible.

01:09:18.708 --> 01:09:20.458
We need to get it in place!

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:25.458
No, wait. Let me do that.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.708
I'll do it.

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.000
There, there. Yuck.

01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:36.875
Yuck, that's gross.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.666
-Are you ready?
-Yeah…

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.250
This will sting a little…

01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:50.791
Mother… fucking… bitch!

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.791
Quiet, or I won't stitch you up.

01:09:55.166 --> 01:09:56.416
Fucking…

01:09:57.375 --> 01:10:00.125
-Time for another one. Are you ready?
-Yes!

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.333
Like that…

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.333
-There we go. I'll pull a little now.
-Yes!

01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:14.916
There.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:22.291
Fuck…

01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:25.500
I look terrible. Fuck.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.000
Oh, my…

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:36.291
Who's this fucking psycho?
Who would do this?

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.250
Maybe it was…

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:42.416
Maybe it was my fault.

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.833
-What?
-Maybe.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:50.666
-What are you talking about?
-I mean, I…

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:53.875
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah, I…

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:58.583
I told him we were going here
for our conference.

01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.291
-Who? Told who?
-I told him…

01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:03.208
I told Frans.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:06.625
-Frans?
-Yes.

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:10.583
Why the fuck are you talking to Frans?

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.000
We are friends.

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:14.041
-Friends?
-Yes.

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:18.375
-Oh, my…
-Right, that explains everything.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:22.166
-What?
-You're unharmed. Aren't you?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.666
-Yes… I'm sorry.
-Everyone is against me, damn it.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.625
Everyone's so fucking stupid.
I need to get away.

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:34.375
Wait for me! I need to come with you!

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.833
Wait for me, Jonas. Wait for me!

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.583
Wait for me, Jonas.

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:48.541
Wait for me!

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:56.958
Push, now! Push, he's coming!

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.291
Push, for fuck's sake!

01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:02.083
He's coming! Push, make yourself useful!

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.958
Stop!

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:08.583
-Ow, Jonas! No!
-Let go!

01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.458
Wait for me! Jonas!

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:24.875
I know why you're doing this, Frans.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.416
But please, listen. That's enough.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.791
I…

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:36.583
I'm on your team.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:42.708
I've really tried to make them understand

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:47.541
how this shopping mall
will impact the environment

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:49.541
and the citizens and…

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:52.750
But no one listens to me.

01:12:53.416 --> 01:12:56.000
I can see why you're angry. I'm angry too.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.875
Don't you want me to help you
take this silly head off? Huh?

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:12.833
It must be really heavy
and difficult to breathe and…

01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:24.666
You're not Frans. Who are you?

01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:51.333
We shall overcome…

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.916
We don't have any vehicles to get us out,

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.333
we can't call anyone

01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:21.083
and there's a killer
waiting for us out there.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.333
If we're lucky. He might be in here.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:25.833
We should stay here until help arrives.

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:27.625
He might kill us before that.

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:32.958
That chef has to come back some time.
How delayed can a dinner really get, huh?

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:33.958
The zipline.

01:14:35.125 --> 01:14:37.458
It would take us right across the lake.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.375
We'll go there together, guys. Come on.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:45.666
Come on, Eva.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:56.458
"WE WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT"

01:14:56.541 --> 01:14:59.333
Amir, come on now.
What's going on? Let's go.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.583
I don't think it's Frans doing this.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.083
What's that?

01:15:06.833 --> 01:15:09.083
Oh, shit… It's Pålsson's boy.

01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:23.708
He was the one
who found his dad in the stable.

01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:25.916
Damn…

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.291
-Let's go, Amir.
-Come on.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:33.166
-Let's do this, damn it.
-Is there gasoline in this?

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:46.041
Can anyone see anything?

01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:15.458
Be quiet!

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:23.958
There he is!

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.250
Back up!

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:31.083
Run!

01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:32.583
Eva!

01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:33.791
No, come back!

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.125
Run, Eva!

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.291
Wait, Eva!

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:39.750
Run!

01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:43.000
-Run, Lina!
-Keep on running!

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.666
No! Here!

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.041
Here.

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.083
There.

01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:16.291
Come on.

01:18:17.583 --> 01:18:19.958
What the hell… Eva?

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.125
What the hell…

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.583
Eva?

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.833
Eva, what the hell?

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:48.791
…then I'll call Mom
and hope she's in a good mood…

01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:51.875
Eva? What the hell?

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:54.125
What are you doing, Eva?

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:58.083
You can't be here.
Surely you understand that, Eva? Come on.

01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:00.791
Don't touch me!

01:19:02.416 --> 01:19:04.333
One more step, Lina. Come on!

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:10.708
Come on. One more step. You can do this.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.416
What the hell?

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.625
What the…

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:21.125
Perhaps it's Anette. Torbjörn, be careful.

01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:22.666
Anette?

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.416
Anette?

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.041
Is it the police?

01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:29.041
Maybe it's the police, Torbjörn.

01:21:30.208 --> 01:21:31.791
Be careful, Torbjörn.

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.000
-Anette?
-Is it Anette?

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.333
Anette, is…

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.166
Run, Eva, damn it. Run!

01:21:57.916 --> 01:21:59.916
You perverted son of a bitch!

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh, come on.

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:07.250
Come on!

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:10.833
Mosquito season started early this year.

01:23:37.583 --> 01:23:40.000
Tor… Tor… Torbjörn!

01:23:51.166 --> 01:23:52.916
-Torbjörn?
-Yeah?

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.583
-I almost had him.
-For sure, Torbjörn.

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:00.250
You did great.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:02.791
-But hey?
-Yeah?

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:05.958
Let's go. Come on, Torbjörn.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:09.500
That bastard.

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:11.375
We're going to finish this.

01:24:11.458 --> 01:24:14.166
We're going to finish this
once and for all, Eva.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:21.500
Okay.

01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:21.208
SOS 112, what's your emergency?

01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:32.666
-Ready?
-Yes, how's your ear?

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:33.708
-What?
-Your ear.

01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:34.916
-Again.
-Your ear!

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.083
It's okay. I put a band-aid on…

01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:39.250
Yeah, that's good.

01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:41.291
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

01:26:58.291 --> 01:26:59.375
Yeah.

01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:18.083
You open the door and I'll stab.

01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:21.958
On three. One, two…

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.166
…three.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.291
Eva! Don't fucking touch Eva!

01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:40.916
Let her go! Let Eva go!

01:27:41.875 --> 01:27:43.333
Let her go!

01:27:44.458 --> 01:27:45.875
Let her go!

01:28:05.583 --> 01:28:09.833
No!

01:28:22.041 --> 01:28:24.333
It's alright, Eva. Now we have him!

01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:25.583
You'll see, Eva!

01:28:26.916 --> 01:28:27.791
Hell yeah!

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:34.875
Yes, fucking burn!
