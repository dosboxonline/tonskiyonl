01:46.739 --> 01:48.900
Attaboy! Keep him busy!

01:52.545 --> 01:54.012
One.
Jesus.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.570
Two.
You got it.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.240
Three.
He ain't getting up!

01:57.316 --> 02:01.776
Four, five, six

02:02.288 --> 02:07.248
seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:07.493 --> 02:08.925
Out!

02:12.965 --> 02:14.262
Come here, Jimmy.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.961
Get that sleeping beauty
out of here!

02:17.636 --> 02:19.763
That's ten in a row, Jimmy!
Ten!

02:19.839 --> 02:24.208
<i>By a knockout, at one minute 46 seconds
in the second round</i>

02:24.276 --> 02:26.039
<i>tonight's light
heavyweight winner</i>

02:26.112 --> 02:28.171
<i>from the great state
of New Jersey</i>

02:28.247 --> 02:31.705
<i>the Bulldog of Bergen,
James J. Braddock!</i>

02:42.762 --> 02:44.559
You're gonna be
the next champ, Jimmy!

02:44.630 --> 02:45.858
Hey, how you doing?

02:45.931 --> 02:47.558
Just give them a few.
Leave them wanting.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.032
You want to sign my name
for me, too?

02:49.101 --> 02:50.591
At least then
they can read it.

02:50.669 --> 02:51.829
You gave him
a cold meat party.

02:51.904 --> 02:53.132
Sign this for me,
Mr. Braddock.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.533
You've been getting
stronger with every fight.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.668
I've been seeing it.

02:58.744 --> 03:01.941
You may favor the right, sure, but
you got no stage fright or nerves.

03:02.014 --> 03:03.572
And you have never
been knocked out.

03:03.649 --> 03:05.879
You're in line.
That's all I'm saying, Jimmy.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.714
You're gonna get your shot.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.082
All right, let me see
what we got here.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.458
$886 for Jeanette

03:13.526 --> 03:15.357
$772 for Lou and Whitey

03:15.427 --> 03:20.296
$1,000 for the ring fees,
my $2,658 and your $3,544

03:20.366 --> 03:25.099
makes $8,860. Stick that
in your mattress, Irishman.

03:26.572 --> 03:28.904
When we get there, you gonna
come in and see the kids?

03:28.974 --> 03:31.465
It's been a while. Come on.
They miss their Uncle Joey.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.809
Yeah, that's very sweet. You
still married to the same girl?

03:35.881 --> 03:37.178
I was this morning.

03:37.249 --> 03:40.150
Well, congratulations.
Maybe I'll take a rain check.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.208
And would you tell her

03:41.387 --> 03:43.412
will you tell her I
undercharged on the gym fees

03:43.522 --> 03:45.854
and no load on the towel? Would
you do that for me, please?

03:45.925 --> 03:48.120
I will be sure to point
it out. I appreciate it.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.287
You stop up at the
corner here somewhere, Frank.

03:50.362 --> 03:53.058
Home to Jersey
for Mr. Adventure over here.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.159
All right, see you, Frank.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.887
I could kill you!

04:21.961 --> 04:24.259
I like the sound of that.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.628
Yeah, I like
the sound of that a lot.

04:27.132 --> 04:28.360
Jimmy.
Yeah?

04:28.434 --> 04:29.628
My sister.

04:30.569 --> 04:32.434
Daddy, did we win?

04:34.540 --> 04:35.734
Yeah, we won.

04:36.308 --> 04:37.866
How are you, Alice?

04:37.943 --> 04:39.808
Good. That's wonderful, Jimmy.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.107
Hey, Howard.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.152
Thank you.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.387
So tell me about him.

04:53.392 --> 04:55.292
Was he a real slugger?

04:57.363 --> 05:02.266
You know,
you could come and watch.

05:05.504 --> 05:08.166
No. You get hit

05:08.274 --> 05:11.869
every time, it feels
like I'm getting hit, too.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.908
And I'm not half as tough
as you are.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.980
So, tell me about the girls.

05:23.989 --> 05:25.149
Girls?

05:28.327 --> 05:30.261
I was at the Garden,
it was a fight night

05:30.329 --> 05:32.194
Come on. There was one.

05:32.898 --> 05:35.128
There must've been one.
No.

05:36.568 --> 05:38.559
Blond?
Brunette.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.270
Tall?

05:46.245 --> 05:48.110
Like a gazelle.

05:48.647 --> 05:51.207
I don't know how it is
she breathed up there.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.742
Mr. Braddock!

05:54.987 --> 05:58.582
You're so strong!

05:59.425 --> 06:04.021
And your hands,
they're so big.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.928
You're so powerful!

06:11.403 --> 06:15.100
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.502
I'm so proud of you.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.405
Introducing

06:22.481 --> 06:26.440
two-time state Golden Gloves
title holder

06:26.652 --> 06:29.780
in both the light heavyweight
and heavyweight divisions

06:29.855 --> 06:33.814
21-0, with 16 wins
coming by way of knockout

06:34.026 --> 06:38.554
the Bulldog of Bergen,
the pride of New Jersey

06:38.897 --> 06:40.728
and the hope of the Irish

06:40.799 --> 06:44.291
as the future champion
of the world

06:44.370 --> 06:48.067
James J. Braddock.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.139
Ma, you woke me up.

07:25.944 --> 07:28.378
Well, you
kicked the covers off, honey.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.243
Now you go back to sleep,
all right?

07:31.784 --> 07:33.376
Good night, Mom.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.079
Good night, sweetheart.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.248
I can't find my socks.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.615
Jim!
I'm sorry.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.056
Mama?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.261
Great.
I'm sorry, baby.

08:51.363 --> 08:54.491
I washed them last night.
Took them right off your feet.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.665
Don't you remember?
No.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.730
Well, you were out
like a light.

09:09.314 --> 09:11.339
How do I keep them this warm?

09:11.917 --> 09:14.351
Mama, I want to eat, too.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.222
Mommy will get you some,
honey.

09:20.325 --> 09:24.022
Hey, Rosy-Rosy.
Good morning, good morning.

09:27.933 --> 09:31.130
Got a notice yesterday.
Gas and electric.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.066
Come on.

09:34.206 --> 09:37.539
Okey-dokey, there we go.
I'll get the milk.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.796
Well, I think
there's some left over.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.332
Yep.

10:09.007 --> 10:11.805
You know, I got that
fight tonight at the armory.

10:13.845 --> 10:16.575
Yeah, one guy, Abe Feldman.

10:16.815 --> 10:18.680
That's $50, win or lose.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.283
That's good.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.216
If I beat him, maybe I can get
my purses back up to $75.

10:24.289 --> 10:26.018
That would be great.

10:27.426 --> 10:30.987
Rosy, use your fork, please.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.229
Who needs a cow, huh?

10:36.301 --> 10:38.201
Mama, I want some more.

10:39.738 --> 10:42.969
I'm sorry, sweetheart. We
need to save some for the boys.

10:47.312 --> 10:48.779
Here you go.

10:49.681 --> 10:52.445
You know, Mae,
I dreamed last night

10:52.684 --> 10:54.879
that I was having dinner
at The Ritz.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.782
With Mickey Rooney
and George Raft.

10:56.855 --> 10:57.947
Really!
Yeah.

10:58.023 --> 11:01.982
And I dreamed I had a steak.
A thick, juicy steak.

11:02.294 --> 11:03.522
Like this, Rosy.

11:04.329 --> 11:06.661
And then I had a mountain
of mashed potatoes

11:06.732 --> 11:09.166
and I went back for ice cream
three times.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.635
I'm stuffed.

11:12.137 --> 11:14.867
I'm absolutely full.
I cannot eat another thing.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.008
Want to give me a hand?

11:18.477 --> 11:19.637
Jim.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.966
Boys, hurry up. Don't dawdle.

11:49.107 --> 11:50.938
Let's try and sleep
a little more.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.020
<i># Sure, business is bunk #</i>

12:02.087 --> 12:04.248
<i># And Wall Street is sunk #</i>

12:04.323 --> 12:06.314
<i># We're all of us broke #</i>

12:06.391 --> 12:08.416
<i># And ready to croak #</i>

12:08.493 --> 12:10.484
<i># We've nothing to dunk #</i>

12:10.562 --> 12:12.530
<i># Can't even get drunk #</i>

12:12.597 --> 12:16.431
<i># And all the while
they tell us to smile #</i>

12:16.902 --> 12:18.995
<i># Cheer up, gentle citizens #</i>

12:19.071 --> 12:20.971
<i># Though you have no shirts #</i>

12:21.039 --> 12:23.132
<i># Happy days are here again #</i>

12:23.208 --> 12:25.267
<i># Cheer up, smile, nertz #</i>

12:25.344 --> 12:27.369
<i># All aboard prosperity #</i>

12:27.446 --> 12:29.346
<i># Giggle till it hurts #</i>

12:29.414 --> 12:31.473
<i># No more breadline charity #</i>

12:31.550 --> 12:33.575
<i># Cheer up, smile, nertz #</i>

12:33.652 --> 12:35.643

12:40.058 --> 12:42.026
<i># Cheer up, smile, nertz ##</i>

12:44.596 --> 12:47.463
I need nine men and only nine.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.525
One. Two. Three.

12:52.604 --> 12:56.802
Four. Five. Six.

13:01.146 --> 13:05.810
Seven. Eight. Nine. That's it!

13:07.185 --> 13:09.176
All right, let's get a move on!

13:10.789 --> 13:14.316
Go on, get going!
Got a lot of work today!

13:30.909 --> 13:32.433
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

13:32.544 --> 13:35.342
No shifts today, Dad?
What're you doing, son?

13:35.414 --> 13:38.247
I'm being good. I'm being
quiet. I'm being 'hayve.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.609
Great.

13:40.685 --> 13:41.982
Daddy!

13:43.622 --> 13:45.715
Hey, Rosy-cheeks.
How you doing?

13:45.791 --> 13:47.759
Daddy, Jay stole!

13:48.160 --> 13:50.219
What?
Jay stole.

14:00.071 --> 14:02.130
What's all this about?
See? It's a salami.

14:02.207 --> 14:04.300
Young lady, your brother's
in enough trouble

14:04.376 --> 14:06.867
without you telling on him.
You understand?

14:08.146 --> 14:09.511
It's from the butcher's.

14:09.581 --> 14:12.141
And he won't say a word
about it, will you, Jay?

14:12.217 --> 14:13.479
Will you, Jay?

14:17.956 --> 14:19.753
Okay, pick it up. Let's go.

14:22.294 --> 14:25.058
Do not test me, boy.
Right now.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.668
Howard, stay here.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.941
Okay, let's go! Come
on, give me a hand here!

14:48.720 --> 14:50.278
Great,
then you don't get paid!

14:50.355 --> 14:51.322
Bye.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.154
Don't forget to
pick it up easy!

15:03.568 --> 15:07.527
Marty Johnson had to go away to
Delaware to live with his uncle.

15:08.874 --> 15:09.932
Why?

15:10.308 --> 15:13.277
His parents didn't have
enough money for them to eat.

15:19.150 --> 15:22.608
Yeah, well, things ain't easy
at the moment, Jay, you're right.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.615
But there's a lot of people
worse off than what we are.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.461
And just 'cause
things ain't easy

15:31.530 --> 15:34.522
that don't give you the excuse
to take what's not yours, does it?

15:34.599 --> 15:37.500
That's stealing, right?
And we don't steal.

15:37.802 --> 15:40.168
No matter what happens,
we don't steal.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.564
Not ever. You got me?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.346
Are you giving me your word?
Yes.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.576
Go on.
I promise.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.853
And I promise you

16:02.661 --> 16:05.027
we will never send you away.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.336
It's okay, kid.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.569
You got a little scared.
I understand.

16:16.508 --> 16:17.600
It's okay.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.729
Jim, he's a very slow guy.

16:41.099 --> 16:42.794
Just plants himself there.

16:42.867 --> 16:45.199
So you just keep him steady.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.569
Keep him trapped in the middle.
Keep dancing around him, okay?

16:50.075 --> 16:52.441
You know what to do.
You know this type.

16:53.678 --> 16:55.111
That guy's a bum.

17:01.252 --> 17:03.243
Two bits will
get a guy a seat.

17:04.055 --> 17:07.183
And that guy gets to watch
you bleed and call you a bum.

17:08.492 --> 17:12.156
And I know I gotta take it from
him, 'cause he's a paying customer.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.597
I see.

17:15.433 --> 17:17.025
Well, well, well.

17:17.902 --> 17:22.066
Pardon me, miss. Allow
me to restate my position.

17:23.742 --> 17:27.405
Mr. Abraham Feldman
is a novice fighter

17:27.479 --> 17:30.175
whose ass you should
gently kick

17:30.248 --> 17:33.046
until it is humped up
between his shoulder blades.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.819
That is, if it doesn't offend
your overly sensitive nature.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.253
God knows.

17:51.169 --> 17:53.569
Now, you see, that break's
still a few weeks away.

17:53.638 --> 17:54.969
I know.
Yeah.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.905
And you were gonna tell me
about this when?

17:56.975 --> 17:59.773
It's gonna be fine. It's
not fine. No, it's not.

17:59.844 --> 18:01.038
What the hell?
You don't tell me?

18:01.112 --> 18:04.411
What the hell kinda crap is
that? I owe everybody money, Joe.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.710
I can't get any shifts.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.652
We ain't got any cash.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.589
I got it.

18:19.564 --> 18:21.862
Screw them.
I'll tape it double.

18:23.334 --> 18:24.528
Thanks.

18:26.304 --> 18:28.431
Keep up. Stay up.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.331
Keep moving.
Keep your legs moving.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.444
<i>And here comes Braddock</i>

18:34.512 --> 18:36.605

18:51.162 --> 18:53.596
<i>a light heavyweight
title challenger.</i>

18:53.665 --> 18:56.828
<i>His golden-boy peak ended
when Tommy Loughran</i>

18:56.901 --> 19:00.667
<i>handled Jim over 15 rounds
back in '29.</i>

19:00.739 --> 19:02.866
<i>Since then,
the oft-injured Braddock</i>

19:02.941 --> 19:05.808
<i>has shown only a glimmer
of his early promise.</i>

19:05.877 --> 19:08.505
<i>And the losses have started
to pile up.</i>

19:08.580 --> 19:10.946
<i>But Braddock continues
to battle.</i>

19:11.883 --> 19:14.681
<i>And here comes
the popular Abe Feldman.</i>

19:14.753 --> 19:16.550
<i>Feldman looks to be
the real thing</i>

19:16.621 --> 19:20.717
<i>and showed some real moxie
in his recent win over Hans Birkie.</i>

19:23.962 --> 19:26.226
Hey, who whipped Latzo?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.665
I did.
Goddamn right.

19:28.733 --> 19:30.530
Who KO'ed Slattery
in the ninth

19:30.602 --> 19:34.129
when everybody said he didn't
have a rainmaker's chance in hell?

19:34.539 --> 19:36.063
That'd have to be me, too.
Right.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.974
And we're supposed to pucker our
assholes over this Abe Feldman?

19:39.043 --> 19:40.977
The guy couldn't break wind.
No.

19:41.479 --> 19:42.844
Hey, Jimmy.

19:44.482 --> 19:46.814
Anyplace else you'd rather be?

19:46.885 --> 19:48.216
No.
Good.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.444
Now, what are you
gonna do about it?

19:51.723 --> 19:54.021
<i>Here we are halfway
through the fifth</i>

19:54.092 --> 19:55.787
<i>And it's more of the same.</i>

19:55.860 --> 19:57.521
<i>The boys clinch again.</i>

19:57.595 --> 19:58.584
Break it up.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.494
He's crushing my guy. Get him off!

20:00.698 --> 20:02.723
Break!

20:02.967 --> 20:05.026
<i>The boo-birds
have started flying here.</i>

20:05.103 --> 20:07.298
<i>They want action
from these fighters.</i>

20:07.405 --> 20:09.498
<i>Feldman sticks a left
in Braddock's face.</i>

20:09.574 --> 20:12.168
<i>Braddock's right hand
is his best and only weapon.</i>

20:12.243 --> 20:15.007
<i>He'll show the left, but it lacks snap
and Feldman knows it.</i>

20:15.079 --> 20:17.639
Come on, give these yokels
a shot in the ass!

20:18.483 --> 20:21.714
<i>Feldman ducks a haymaker
but fails to follow up.</i>

20:29.460 --> 20:31.291
<i>And another big right
by Braddock.</i>

20:31.362 --> 20:33.296
<i>Now, there's the Braddock
we all recall.</i>

20:33.364 --> 20:35.992
<i>But it's one at a time.
It may not be enough.</i>

20:37.268 --> 20:38.360
Come on!

21:06.097 --> 21:07.860
<i>The referee pulls
the boys apart.</i>

21:07.932 --> 21:10.059
<i>And there's the bell
to end the fifth.</i>

21:10.134 --> 21:11.999
Easy now. Easy.

21:13.972 --> 21:17.408
I saw that.
You bust it again?

21:18.042 --> 21:19.805
I'm calling it, Jim.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.013
You gonna use the left?
Okay, good.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.245
You get in there but you
don't let him crowd you.

21:28.319 --> 21:30.549
You work his belly, you
hammer his belly with the left.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.988
Last round. Come on,
you got to show me something.

21:33.057 --> 21:35.150
Give me a good one. You're
giving me an ulcer, Harry!

21:35.226 --> 21:36.284
Shut up.

21:36.494 --> 21:38.792
Work his belly with the left.
You got it?

21:38.863 --> 21:41.593
Give him the flapdoodle with
the right because he don't know.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.634
Right?
'Cause he's kind of stupid.

21:43.701 --> 21:45.498
Okay? Last round.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.301
Last round! Go get him!

21:48.039 --> 21:49.734
The left!

21:51.609 --> 21:54.305
Damn it, I wish he could find
his goddamn left.

21:55.346 --> 21:57.314
That's it! Change it up!

21:57.916 --> 21:59.406
Southpaw, that's it!

21:59.484 --> 22:02.044
<i>Feldman prancing around,
looking for an opening</i>

22:02.120 --> 22:04.782
<i>but still few clean punches
by the fighters.</i>

22:04.856 --> 22:07.256
<i>Braddock still pawing away
with the left.</i>

22:07.892 --> 22:10.122
<i>Another ineffectual left
from Feldman.</i>

22:10.194 --> 22:13.994
<i>Braddock can hardly lift his arms.
He's slow on his feet.</i>

22:14.065 --> 22:16.829
<i>At least Gould in his corner
is still throwing punches</i>

22:16.901 --> 22:18.766
<i>trying to urge his man on.</i>

22:22.307 --> 22:23.706
Go home!

22:29.280 --> 22:30.440
Go home, Braddock!

22:31.716 --> 22:33.274
No holding, Braddock!

22:33.351 --> 22:35.911
<i>Cavanaugh's working harder
than the fighters.</i>

22:36.955 --> 22:38.183
Dry up!

22:40.825 --> 22:41.951
<i>Another clinch.</i>

22:42.026 --> 22:45.962
<i>It's as if 80 tough fights
have finally jumped on Braddock's back.</i>

22:46.864 --> 22:48.627
You're a bum!

22:54.973 --> 22:55.997
That's it!

22:56.074 --> 22:58.099
<i>Cavanaugh pulls them apart,
and he's called the fight.</i>

22:58.176 --> 22:59.507
<i>He's called the fight.</i>

23:00.311 --> 23:02.006
<i>It's a "no contest. "</i>

23:02.080 --> 23:05.777
<i>And the popcorn and the peanuts
are raining down.</i>

23:05.850 --> 23:09.308
<i>And I'm afraid to say that's all these
fighters deserve</i>

23:09.387 --> 23:11.480
<i>for the show
they put on tonight.</i>

23:13.591 --> 23:17.083
<i>I'm telling you, it's sad to see
a fighter that was once</i>

23:17.161 --> 23:19.789
<i>the caliber of James Braddock
reduced to this.</i>

23:19.864 --> 23:21.456
It's all right, Jimmy.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.402
An embarrassment,
that's what it was.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.767
An embarrassment!

23:26.838 --> 23:28.237
Where the hell's the purse?

23:28.306 --> 23:29.933
You wouldn't have
to be asking that

23:30.008 --> 23:31.976
if you gave a shit
about your fighter.

23:32.043 --> 23:35.376
Okay. He's fighting hurt.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.509
Maybe you got a bunch of fat
and happy fighters at home

23:38.583 --> 23:41.575
can afford to rest a month between
bouts. I don't know. Lucky you!

23:41.652 --> 23:44.120
Christ, he hardly gets
a punch in anymore!

23:44.455 --> 23:47.549
Fights being stopped by
referees? He's pathetic!

23:48.393 --> 23:50.520
Fights like
that keep people away.

23:54.032 --> 23:55.556
We're revoking his license,
Joe.

23:56.901 --> 24:00.359
Whatever Braddock was gonna do
in boxing, I guess he's done it.

24:00.705 --> 24:03.538
Wait a minute.
That's all.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.475
Oh, boy.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.419
Mr. Johnston!

24:19.624 --> 24:20.682
Jim.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.218
What's going on?

24:23.928 --> 24:26.556
You didn't tell him?
Yeah, of course I told him.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.292
He wanted to
hear it from you.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.459
Come on, Mr. Johnston,
no contest?

24:30.902 --> 24:33.632
I broke my hand.
Okay? It's legit.

24:33.905 --> 24:35.998
You don't see me
crying about it.

24:36.441 --> 24:38.341
I don't see what you got
to complain about.

24:38.409 --> 24:42.175
I still went out there, I still put
on a show. I did what I could do.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.612
You know, we did that
boondock circuit for you

24:44.682 --> 24:46.206
me and Joe. Remember?

24:48.186 --> 24:51.121
I didn't quit on you.
And I didn't quit tonight.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.353
I didn't always lose.

24:55.593 --> 24:57.390
I won't always lose again.

24:58.229 --> 25:00.459
I can still fight.
Go home.

25:00.531 --> 25:03.557
I can still fight. Go home
to Mae and the kids, Jim.

25:05.536 --> 25:07.629
Go home? Go home with what?

25:08.306 --> 25:12.800
Go home with what? A broken
hand from Mount Vernon?

25:14.712 --> 25:16.407
Mr. Johnston!

25:50.915 --> 25:52.007
Baby?

26:00.858 --> 26:02.450
What happened?

26:03.427 --> 26:05.122
I didn't get the dough.

26:06.297 --> 26:07.924
They didn't pay up.

26:10.001 --> 26:13.698
They called it a "no contest,"
said the fight was an embarrassment.

26:15.239 --> 26:16.831
They decommissioned me.

26:20.945 --> 26:22.469
Jimmy,
what happened to your hand?

26:22.547 --> 26:24.742
It's broke again
in three places.

26:25.883 --> 26:27.407
They said I'm through, Mae.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.544
They said
I can't be a boxer no more.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.087
Mercy.

26:36.394 --> 26:37.486
Okay.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.931
Jimmy, if you can't work

26:45.002 --> 26:48.165
we're not gonna be able to pay
the electric, or the heat.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.877
And we're out of credit
at the grocery.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.347
So I think we need
to pack the kids.

27:02.153 --> 27:04.621
They could stay at my sister's
for a little while

27:04.689 --> 27:07.817
and I'll take in more sewing.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.519
That way we could make
two, three breadlines a day.

27:09.594 --> 27:11.118
I'll get doubles, triples,
whatever I can find.

27:11.195 --> 27:13.493
Jimmy, you can't work.
Mae, I can still work.

27:13.564 --> 27:16.055
Jimmy, you can't work.
Your hand's broken.

27:18.202 --> 27:19.567
They see me
lugging this around,

27:19.637 --> 27:20.797
you're right,
they won't pick me.

27:20.871 --> 27:22.964
Not down the docks,
not anywhere.

27:24.742 --> 27:26.403
So we're gonna cover it up

27:26.477 --> 27:28.104
with the shoe polish.

27:30.314 --> 27:31.474
Okay?

27:58.409 --> 28:01.037
I'm sorry.
No.

28:06.917 --> 28:08.077
No.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.652
No.

28:40.084 --> 28:42.917
I need five and only five!

28:43.421 --> 28:45.286
Come on, Jake!

28:46.691 --> 28:48.056
One.

28:49.927 --> 28:51.224
Two.

28:53.864 --> 28:55.297
Three.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.095
Four.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.299
Five. That's it!

29:18.189 --> 29:20.384
What the hell
happened to your face?

29:20.791 --> 29:22.691
I got in a fight.
Yeah?

29:22.993 --> 29:24.790
What'd you go do that for?

29:25.730 --> 29:27.357
That's a good question.

29:28.299 --> 29:29.698
Mike Wilson.

29:30.634 --> 29:31.931
Jim Braddock.

29:32.503 --> 29:35.529
I used to follow a pretty good
fighter with that name.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.877
And there's some other guy
going around using that name now.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.845
Can't fight for shit.

29:42.913 --> 29:46.246
Gambling man will lose
a lot of money on him. Twice.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.556
That hand ain't gonna work.

29:55.626 --> 29:57.958
You can't slow me down.
I need this job.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.697
I need the job, too.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.165
What's wrong with
the goddamn hand?

30:20.818 --> 30:22.979
You see us
falling behind, Jake?

30:24.989 --> 30:26.388
He's all right.

30:34.465 --> 30:35.830
Appreciate it.

30:39.136 --> 30:40.933
I'll get a cold beer.

30:41.472 --> 30:42.996
Just a water for me, Quincy.

30:43.073 --> 30:45.507
All I got today
are big spenders.

30:45.576 --> 30:47.510
Beer for him, too. I'm buying.

30:48.879 --> 30:50.471
Don't hurt my feelings.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.813
It's been a while, but You
don't have to twist my arm.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.984
Yeah, I used to be a
broker. Still lost it all in '29.

31:00.424 --> 31:01.789
Yeah, me, too.

31:02.726 --> 31:05.627
I had just about everything
I ever earned in stocks.

31:06.096 --> 31:07.927
Even had a little
taxi company.

31:07.998 --> 31:11.399
I mean, who loses their dough
on cabs in New York City, right?

31:11.569 --> 31:14.595
Well, I thought that one
was gold for the grandkiddies.

31:14.672 --> 31:17.539
You know, there's people living
in shacks in Central Park.

31:17.608 --> 31:19.303
Call it the Hooverville.

31:19.543 --> 31:21.773
This government's
dropped us flat.

31:21.846 --> 31:25.407
We need to organize, you know?
Unionize. Fight back.

31:26.617 --> 31:28.380
Fight? Fight what?

31:28.452 --> 31:30.818
Bad luck? Greed? Drought?

31:31.789 --> 31:33.416
No point punching things
you can't see.

31:33.491 --> 31:35.721
No, we'll work
a way through this.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.489
FDR, he's gonna handle it.
Screw FDR.

31:38.829 --> 31:41.024
FDR, Hoover,
they're all the same.

31:41.098 --> 31:43.794
You know, I come home one day.
I stand in my living room.

31:43.868 --> 31:46.860
And between the mortgage and the
market and the goddamn lawyer

31:46.937 --> 31:48.734
that was supposed
to be working for me

31:48.806 --> 31:50.569
it stopped being mine.

31:51.642 --> 31:53.542
It all stopped being mine.

31:54.411 --> 31:57.141
FDR ain't given me
my house back yet.

32:03.187 --> 32:05.815
Mama, why can't I
go to school?

32:05.890 --> 32:07.824
Is it because I'm a girl?

32:08.559 --> 32:11.323
Maybe. Hadn't thought of that.

32:16.534 --> 32:18.661
Who's that man
at our house?

32:20.604 --> 32:22.071
Excuse me!

32:25.109 --> 32:26.736
Can I help you?

32:26.944 --> 32:28.673
I'm sorry, lady,
you're past due.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.112
No, you can't.

32:31.181 --> 32:33.240
You can't.
There's kids.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.815
If I
don't, they let me go.

32:36.820 --> 32:39.448
They already let two guys go.
Please.

32:40.291 --> 32:44.387
This apartment, it's what we got
left that keeps us hanging on.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.358
Lady, I got kids, too.

32:57.608 --> 32:58.973
$6.74.

32:59.877 --> 33:01.708
How much to turn it back on?

33:03.781 --> 33:07.217
Four months. $44.12.

33:13.457 --> 33:17.154
If I work 26 hours out of
every 24, it still won't add up.

33:23.467 --> 33:26.561
We ain't got nothing.
Nothing left to sell.

33:32.242 --> 33:34.506
All the guys
you could've married, huh?

33:36.647 --> 33:40.208
Yeah.
What happened to those guys?

34:01.605 --> 34:02.867
It's Howard.

34:04.775 --> 34:06.333
Since this afternoon.

34:15.252 --> 34:16.981
"Bless us, O Lord

34:17.353 --> 34:20.083
"and these thy gifts which
we are about to receive

34:20.157 --> 34:21.715
from thy bounty. "

34:28.565 --> 34:30.032
I'm all prayed out.

34:41.445 --> 34:43.106
Here's more firewood.

34:50.054 --> 34:54.047
Where are you going?
I said where are you going?

34:55.259 --> 34:58.456
Go to hell,
you no-good bastard!

34:58.529 --> 35:01.589
Go on, then!
We don't need you!

35:01.665 --> 35:05.123
All right. Help me,
pick up some of that wood.

35:05.202 --> 35:07.500
I got it, Mama.
All right, let's go, sweetheart.

35:07.571 --> 35:08.936
All right, honey.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.906
Nice and warm, huh?

35:23.420 --> 35:24.546
Baby?

35:26.657 --> 35:27.646
Baby?

35:28.092 --> 35:29.582
Look at Mommy.

35:35.332 --> 35:36.697
Sweetheart.

35:45.142 --> 35:46.336
Mommy?

35:52.149 --> 35:53.309
What's wrong?

35:55.385 --> 35:57.182
Nothing, sweetheart.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.120
Mommy will be right back,
okay?

36:54.578 --> 36:59.015
Howard's fever was getting worse
and then Rosy started to sneeze.

37:11.128 --> 37:13.995
Where are they, Mae? Jim,
we can't even keep 'em warm.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.093
Where are the kids?

37:18.135 --> 37:21.002
The boys will sleep on the
sofa at my father's in Brooklyn.

37:21.071 --> 37:22.766
And Rosy'll stay
at my sister's.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.501
Jimmy, we can't keep 'em!

37:24.575 --> 37:27.237
You don't make decisions
about our children without me.

37:27.311 --> 37:30.280
What if they get really sick?
We already owe Dr. McDonald

37:30.347 --> 37:32.372
If you send them away, then
all this has been for nothing!

37:32.449 --> 37:34.644
It's just until we get back
What else was it for?

37:34.718 --> 37:36.913
If we can't stay together,
that means we lost!

37:36.987 --> 37:39.080
That means we've given up!
I am not giving up!

37:39.156 --> 37:41.989
I'm trying to protect our
children. Mae, I promised him.

37:43.026 --> 37:44.391
Outside the butcher's.

37:44.461 --> 37:45.450
I looked him in the eyes

37:45.529 --> 37:47.087
and I promised him
with all of my heart

37:47.164 --> 37:49.564
I would never ever
send him away.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.991
You can't do this.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.031
You weren't here.

37:56.073 --> 37:57.563
You can't break my promise.

37:59.409 --> 38:02.606
Jim, you didn't see.
You weren't here.

38:11.955 --> 38:13.047
I'm sorry.

38:17.527 --> 38:18.824
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

38:22.599 --> 38:24.362
What are you doing?

38:28.972 --> 38:30.234
Jim?

38:31.341 --> 38:34.799
Jimmy! Where you going?

38:36.780 --> 38:38.304
Where you going, Jimmy?

38:57.901 --> 39:00.495
That doesn't qualify you,
sir. What else can you tell me?

39:00.570 --> 39:03.061
The problem is my wife
is losing all of her teeth.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.698
I got a relief order
for her.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.039
The doctor says
it's due to insufficient diet.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.408
She's still nursing the baby
on account of

39:09.479 --> 39:11.106
we can't afford milk
for the family.

39:11.181 --> 39:12.307
Okay.

39:23.927 --> 39:26.054
I never thought
I'd see you here, Jim.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.259
He jumped up

40:39.536 --> 40:41.595
kicked his stool
out of the ring

40:42.706 --> 40:44.298
and he was just,
he was furious.

40:44.374 --> 40:45.500
I grabbed the mike

40:52.249 --> 40:54.080
There's Jimmy Braddock.

41:01.058 --> 41:02.923
The thing is,
I can't afford to

41:04.694 --> 41:05.922
I can't afford
to pay the heat.

41:07.030 --> 41:08.622
I've had to
farm out my kids.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.562
You know, they keep cutting
shifts down at the docks

41:12.669 --> 41:14.728
and you just don't get picked
every day.

41:18.442 --> 41:20.967
I sold everything I've got
that anybody would buy.

41:28.718 --> 41:31.710
I went on public assistance. I
signed on at the relief office.

41:32.422 --> 41:35.880
They gave me $19.
I need another $18.38

41:35.959 --> 41:38.951
so I can pay the bill
and get the kids back.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.792
You know me well enough to know
if I had anywhere else to go

41:48.371 --> 41:49.565
I wouldn't be here.

41:54.044 --> 41:57.207
If you could help me through this
time, I sure would be grateful.

42:09.893 --> 42:11.258
Sure, Jim. Sure.

42:19.436 --> 42:20.596
Good luck.

42:21.771 --> 42:22.999
Jim.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.506
Hey, Jimmy.

42:58.041 --> 42:59.406
Here you go, Jim.

43:00.944 --> 43:02.206
Good luck, Jim.

43:24.601 --> 43:27.126
I'm sorry, Joe, I didn't
I'm sorry.

43:29.506 --> 43:31.838
What in the hell do you have
to be sorry about?

43:32.642 --> 43:34.303
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.

43:41.651 --> 43:43.084
How short are you?

43:54.931 --> 43:56.455
About $1.50.

43:59.469 --> 44:00.561
Okay.

44:03.073 --> 44:04.904
We're home! Hooray, we're home!

44:05.208 --> 44:06.641
We're glad to be home!

44:09.980 --> 44:11.072
Good.

44:18.822 --> 44:19.948
Okay. All right.

44:20.824 --> 44:24.658
Howard, don't jump on
the bed. Sorry, Mama.

44:25.262 --> 44:26.593
Read to me, Jay.

44:27.397 --> 44:29.388
"On his way up
and down the stairs "

44:29.466 --> 44:32.458
Do you like being
home? I like being home, too.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.128
My little doll.

44:37.774 --> 44:41.039
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

44:45.415 --> 44:49.283
<i># Happy birthday,
dear Howard #</i>

44:51.788 --> 44:55.087
<i># Happy birthday to you ##</i>

44:55.392 --> 44:56.689
Make a wish, kids.

44:56.893 --> 44:57.985
Blow!

45:03.066 --> 45:05.694
Hey, Howard, come on.
They're gonna cut the cake up.

45:05.835 --> 45:06.995
You wanna line up, huh?

45:07.504 --> 45:09.665
You looking forward
to some chocolate cake?

45:09.773 --> 45:11.707
I liked it better
when we had our own.

45:11.908 --> 45:13.239
I can understand that.

45:17.314 --> 45:18.975
Hiya, Howard. Hi.

45:19.182 --> 45:21.946
Hey, your dad ever tell you
that I used to spar with him?

45:22.686 --> 45:25.246
You hit the Father?
As often as I possibly could.

45:25.789 --> 45:28.280
He was kinda tricky, though.
Hard to catch.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.015
Go and get some cake. Go on.

45:31.428 --> 45:32.827
Missed you at mass, Jimmy.

45:33.563 --> 45:35.827
I can get an extra shift
on a Sunday, you know?

45:35.899 --> 45:37.764
Don't you walk
away from me! James.

45:37.834 --> 45:38.926
Mike, you hear me?

45:39.002 --> 45:40.094
Excuse me.

45:40.170 --> 45:43.037
Every day, "fix the world. "
How about fixing your family?

45:43.106 --> 45:44.539
What kind of father
are you?

45:44.607 --> 45:47.770
Too proud to cross the street
because she can't have her own cake?

45:47.844 --> 45:50.312
And now you're drunk at
church, for Christ's sake.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.508
That a joke, Sara? Making a
joke? I'm just saying it's enough!

45:53.583 --> 45:56.313
Guys, where's the ref? Why
don't you stay out of this?

45:56.386 --> 45:59.355
It's between man and wife. How
do you even call yourself that?

45:59.422 --> 46:00.411
What'd you say to me?
Come on.

46:00.490 --> 46:01.514
Get your hands off me!

46:01.591 --> 46:02.649
You've had a couple drinks.
It's Sunday.

46:02.726 --> 46:05.126
No harm in that. Day of rest.
All washed up. Can't get a fight.

46:05.195 --> 46:06.355
What, you want to fight me?

46:06.429 --> 46:07.760
Mike,
you don't have to do this.

46:07.831 --> 46:09.093
I ain't got no beef
with you.

46:09.165 --> 46:11.531
Come on! Can't make it in the ring, huh?

46:12.135 --> 46:14.296
Come on, Braddock,
I'll take your head off!

46:15.071 --> 46:18.529
Jim, no!
Mike, you okay, baby?

46:19.542 --> 46:20.975
Why don't you get off me?

46:21.511 --> 46:23.376
Go to hell! The both of you!

46:24.381 --> 46:26.212
Jesus, Jim,
he wasn't gonna hit me.

46:28.818 --> 46:30.376
Mike, wait!

46:41.297 --> 46:44.391
Now, what it's all about is
rotating your body behind your fist.

46:44.467 --> 46:46.594
Bang. That's right.
Right in the kisser, yeah.

46:48.671 --> 46:49.660
There you go.

46:52.442 --> 46:55.741
Good girl. You got a
better jab than your dad.

46:57.714 --> 47:01.480
Boy, you are a brave man. Not
really. Mae's at the store.

47:02.952 --> 47:04.442
That's a good one, kiddo!

47:04.521 --> 47:07.115
You want to go play with the other
kids while I talk to Uncle Joe?

47:09.626 --> 47:13.062
Joe Gould,
still looking dapper, I see.

47:13.363 --> 47:16.264
Certainly. Gotta keep up
appearances, right?

47:17.867 --> 47:20.199
Good to see you, Jimmy.
Nice to see you, Joe.

47:21.871 --> 47:23.395
Nice day, huh?

47:24.507 --> 47:25.838
Yeah.

47:28.044 --> 47:30.774
You drove all the way out here
to talk about the weather?

47:30.847 --> 47:33.611
Maybe I was in the neighborhood.
Did you ever think of that?

47:33.683 --> 47:34.843
Little fresh air.

47:35.618 --> 47:37.643
Joe, this is Jersey.

47:39.656 --> 47:41.055
Yeah. Good point.

47:46.362 --> 47:47.590
I got you a fight.

47:49.332 --> 47:51.357
Go to hell. Come on.
You want it, don't you?

47:51.434 --> 47:54.665
What, we gonna bring this up with
the Boxing Commission, or not?

47:54.737 --> 47:57.865
Yes, and they'll sanction it.
This one fight, and one fight only.

47:57.941 --> 48:00.466
It's not a comeback, right?
It's just one fight.

48:01.244 --> 48:03.109
Why?
'Cause of who you're fighting.

48:03.446 --> 48:04.504
How much?

48:04.581 --> 48:06.071
Just once, ask me who
it is you're fighting.

48:06.149 --> 48:08.515
How much?
$250.

48:08.751 --> 48:11.481
You're on at the big show
at the Garden, tomorrow night.

48:11.554 --> 48:13.784
You fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy.

48:13.857 --> 48:15.950
Number two heavyweight
contender in the world.

48:16.025 --> 48:17.754
Prelim before
the championship bout.

48:17.827 --> 48:20.022
You know, Joe, this
ain't funny. No, it's not.

48:20.096 --> 48:22.030
And it ain't no favor,
either.

48:22.098 --> 48:24.464
Griffin's opponent got cut,
and he couldn't fight.

48:24.534 --> 48:27.162
So they had to find somebody they
could throw in at a day's notice.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.568
Nobody legit would

48:31.441 --> 48:34.274
Nobody would take a fight
with Griffin without training.

48:35.378 --> 48:39.508
So I told them use the angle
Griffin's gonna knock out a guy

48:40.283 --> 48:41.614
never been knocked out.

48:42.819 --> 48:44.013
You're meat, Jimmy.

48:44.487 --> 48:45.784
Are you on the level, Joe?

48:45.855 --> 48:47.550
Come on. Always.

48:47.891 --> 48:49.859
For $250,
I would fight your wife.

48:50.860 --> 48:51.849
Now you're dreaming.

48:51.928 --> 48:53.691
And your grandmother.
At the same time.

48:53.763 --> 48:55.128
Teeth in or teeth out?
Take them out.

48:55.198 --> 48:56.722
Then you're dead.
You're down, you're gone.

48:56.799 --> 48:57.891
No chance.
$250?

48:57.967 --> 48:59.264
250 bananas. Come here.

49:03.773 --> 49:05.536
Get your programs here!

49:08.011 --> 49:10.445
Programs here! 25 cents!

49:11.814 --> 49:14.942
I mean, for Christ's sake,
100 and something fights

49:15.018 --> 49:16.485
you never been knocked out.

49:16.553 --> 49:18.453
Who the hell goes
and sells his gear?

49:19.122 --> 49:21.113
80 fights as a pro,
50 as an amateur.

49:21.958 --> 49:24.825
How soon they forget!
I'm so sorry.

49:24.928 --> 49:27.954
Borrowed gear, borrowed robe.
Knock yourself out.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.191
Joe.

49:35.338 --> 49:38.432
I might as well get an Aooga horn
and chase him around the ring.

49:40.476 --> 49:43.240
That's good.
You been drinking?

49:43.313 --> 49:45.144
Are you trying to
hurt my feelings?

49:45.415 --> 49:48.612
You're just too loose. You're
spooking me. Sharpen up.

49:48.685 --> 49:51.779
Come on, Joe, we both
know what this is, right?

49:52.889 --> 49:56.188
I get to put a little more distance
between my kids and the street

49:56.593 --> 49:59.494
and I get to say good-bye
at the Garden.

50:01.397 --> 50:03.194
Full house,
night of a big fight.

50:04.534 --> 50:05.865
Thank you very much.

50:06.102 --> 50:08.002
Right. Come on, hurry up.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.930
Let's get the lead
out of here.

50:13.409 --> 50:14.774
What the hell was that?

50:15.878 --> 50:18.176
They ran out of soup
on the line this morning.

50:18.247 --> 50:20.306
Ran out of soup
on the line this morning.

50:20.383 --> 50:23.284
How the hell are you supposed
to fight on an empty stomach?

50:23.820 --> 50:25.185
<i>Good evening.</i>

50:25.254 --> 50:30.021

50:33.496 --> 50:36.556
Hash is all they had, okay?
Eat, quick.

50:37.166 --> 50:39.726
You got a spoon? For
Christ's sake, it's not there?

50:39.802 --> 50:42.032
Come on, we gotta go anyway.
One bite, Joe.

50:42.105 --> 50:44.073
I'll eat it with my fingers.
Whoa, hey!

50:44.507 --> 50:46.270
I don't have time
to re-tape you.

50:46.576 --> 50:49.443
Just sit tight,
and I'll find you a spoon.

50:51.147 --> 50:52.580
For Christ's sake.

51:04.027 --> 51:06.495
Is that a ghost
I'm seeing? An apparition?

51:06.562 --> 51:09.759
Or is that James J. Braddock,
the Bulldog of Bergen?

51:10.066 --> 51:12.534
How you feeling, Jimmy?
How's that right hand?

51:12.602 --> 51:14.001
Braddock, you're up!

51:19.809 --> 51:22.209

How you doing?

52:12.161 --> 52:15.130
"The walk from the locker room
to the ring

52:15.198 --> 52:18.326
was the only time tonight
old Jim Braddock "

52:18.401 --> 52:19.925
Looking good, Jimmy!

52:20.303 --> 52:22.237
" was seen on his feet. "
You got that?

52:22.305 --> 52:24.773
<i>Before tonight's championship
battle, we'll bring you</i>

52:24.841 --> 52:27.605
<i>a special bout featuring
Charlie Harvey's soldier boy</i>

52:27.977 --> 52:29.308
<i>Corn Griffin.</i>

52:29.378 --> 52:31.039
<i>Griffin is the fella
that ran rings</i>

52:31.114 --> 52:33.241
<i>around the champion Carnera
in training.</i>

52:33.483 --> 52:34.882
<i>And who's his opponent?</i>

52:34.951 --> 52:38.079
<i>Looks like they dug old Jim Braddock
out of retirement</i>

52:38.154 --> 52:39.587
<i>at least for one more fight.</i>

52:39.789 --> 52:41.450
<i>Hey, Mike! Griffin is up
in the ring now.</i>

52:41.524 --> 52:43.754
<i>Braddock? Isn't that your buddy?
Look at the size of him!</i>

52:44.560 --> 52:46.755
<i>In this corner</i>

52:48.397 --> 52:52.094
<i>the sensational
heavyweight slugger</i>

<i>from Fort Benning, Georgia</i>

<i>His opponent:

<i>who has never been KO'ed in more than
80 professional bouts</i>

53:13.956 --> 53:15.184
Quincy, beer. We got a fight!

<i>from North Bergen,
New Jersey</i>

53:19.796 --> 53:22.424
<i>James J. Braddock!</i>

53:47.924 --> 53:49.915
<i>The skinny from
the reporters at ringside</i>

53:49.992 --> 53:52.017
<i>is that Braddock
won't last two rounds.</i>

53:52.094 --> 53:54.585
<i>Griffin is a five-to-one
favorite to do just that.</i>

53:54.664 --> 53:57.189
<i>But Joe Gould claims
Braddock's right hand is fine.</i>

53:57.266 --> 53:59.257
<i>Jimmy will need
two good hands tonight.</i>

54:04.974 --> 54:06.839
<i>Griffin storms out
of his corner!</i>

54:07.210 --> 54:09.269
<i>Things are up-tempo right away.</i>

54:12.415 --> 54:14.315
Come on, Braddock,
make a fight of it!

54:21.490 --> 54:23.617
Get out of it! Get out, Jimmy!

54:23.726 --> 54:25.489
<i>Braddock takes a left
to the body</i>

54:25.561 --> 54:26.755
<i>and a hard right to the head!</i>

54:26.829 --> 54:28.490
<i>Braddock's giving ground now.</i>

54:28.865 --> 54:29.957
<i>A hard right!</i>

54:30.032 --> 54:31.590
<i>Pins him in
the neutral corner.</i>

54:32.001 --> 54:33.662
Get outta there, Jim! Get out!

54:33.736 --> 54:34.725
<i>Griffin's all over him!</i>

54:35.671 --> 54:37.161
<i>Braddock taking hard jabs.</i>

54:39.775 --> 54:41.265
<i>And Braddock is down.</i>

54:41.544 --> 54:43.512
Shut up! I wanna hear this!
Shut up!

54:44.380 --> 54:47.747
Jim? You're fine. Stay down.

54:56.359 --> 54:58.725
One. Two.
Stay down! What's the hurry?

54:58.794 --> 55:01.058
Three. Four.
Hey! Listen.

55:01.130 --> 55:03.564
I liked the left. Try two lefts. Five.

55:03.633 --> 55:04.895
Give him two lefts!
Six.

55:04.967 --> 55:06.901
Pop, pop! Double it up.
Seven.

55:06.969 --> 55:08.937
How 'bout it? Up, up.
Eight.

55:09.005 --> 55:10.632
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go.

55:10.706 --> 55:11.695
Nine.

55:12.108 --> 55:14.099
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!
On your feet, come on!

55:15.344 --> 55:17.608
<i>The referee waving Griffin in.</i>

55:18.281 --> 55:19.270
Move in on that.

55:19.348 --> 55:20.679
Nice move!

55:21.384 --> 55:23.045
Bring him in!

55:24.787 --> 55:26.084
<i>Snaps a stiff jab! Another!</i>

55:27.957 --> 55:29.618
Welcome to New York.

55:29.692 --> 55:31.592
Beautiful!

55:32.194 --> 55:34.094
That's more like it!
Let me see that cut.

55:34.697 --> 55:36.130
You look great!

55:36.933 --> 55:39.800
It sure as hell beats working
on the docks!

55:41.437 --> 55:45.134
Say, the two jabs look
sensational! They look sweet!

55:45.508 --> 55:47.635
Now, he's loading up on you.
You see that?

55:47.710 --> 55:50.838
He opens up after you jab him. You
gotta come in there with a right.

55:50.913 --> 55:51.902
Real quick.

55:52.882 --> 55:55.077
But you gotta stop
some of those left hands.

55:56.052 --> 55:57.952
You see any
getting past my head?

55:58.454 --> 55:59.512
Keep moving!

56:03.426 --> 56:05.155
<i>Griffin still winging
big shots.</i>

56:05.227 --> 56:07.354
<i>He wants to be the first
to stop Braddock.</i>

56:09.532 --> 56:11.557
<i>Braddock gets in
another big right hand!</i>

56:11.667 --> 56:13.828
<i>Snapped Griffin's head back
with that one.</i>

56:15.538 --> 56:16.903
Come on!

56:16.973 --> 56:18.304
<i>Griffin loading up.</i>

56:21.444 --> 56:23.105
Move out!
Give him the slip, Jimmy!

56:23.179 --> 56:25.010
<i>Another big flurry by Griffin!</i>

56:25.081 --> 56:28.744
<i>Braddock hanging tough but, folks,
he is taking a beating!</i>

56:30.987 --> 56:33.615
That's two rounds more
than I thought he was gonna go.

56:34.256 --> 56:36.554
He's a half a step behind you.
Do you feel it?

56:37.693 --> 56:39.593
Stick with it.

56:39.829 --> 56:40.955
Busy, busy.

56:42.798 --> 56:44.925
<i>Six minutes of fury so far.</i>

56:45.668 --> 56:48.796
<i>Braddock has the look of a man
trying to hold back an avalanche.</i>

56:51.440 --> 56:53.340
<i>Griffin hits him with a left.</i>

56:53.409 --> 56:55.400
<i>And Braddock is stepping
in post holes.</i>

56:57.980 --> 56:59.572
Keep him in front of you!

57:01.283 --> 57:02.375
Lure him in, Jim.

57:02.952 --> 57:04.783
<i>Jimmy's finally
moving his head.</i>

57:06.455 --> 57:08.013
Pick your spot!

57:17.133 --> 57:18.430
<i>And Griffin is down!</i>

57:23.873 --> 57:26.137
Where the hell have you been,
Jimmy Braddock?

57:26.976 --> 57:30.173
One. Two. Three.

57:30.646 --> 57:32.113
<i>He's up at three.</i>

57:32.381 --> 57:34.008
<i>The referee wipes his gloves.</i>

57:41.690 --> 57:44.887
That's it!
No daylight!

57:45.127 --> 57:46.651
Take it to him!

57:47.063 --> 57:48.792
<i>Another big right by Braddock!</i>

57:48.931 --> 57:50.398
Finish him, Jimmy!

57:57.706 --> 58:00.402
Knock him back
to the goddamn Ozarks!

58:02.978 --> 58:04.411
<i>Griffin is ready to go!</i>

58:06.348 --> 58:07.713
Be careful.

58:08.017 --> 58:09.382
Get back.

58:10.019 --> 58:12.510
Get back there.
Get back in your corner.

58:17.793 --> 58:18.987
Jimmy!

58:22.598 --> 58:25.066
<i>This fight is over!
This is incredible!</i>

58:25.134 --> 58:27.967
<i>Corn Griffin, the number two
contender in the world</i>

58:28.037 --> 58:31.495
<i>has just been knocked out
by Jim Braddock in the third round!</i>

58:31.574 --> 58:32.905
<i>What an upset!</i>

58:32.975 --> 58:34.670
You son of a bitch!

58:34.743 --> 58:36.938
<i>It's pandemonium here
in the Garden!</i>

58:37.012 --> 58:39.446
That's it, man, he did it!
I don't believe it!

58:41.517 --> 58:43.576
You beautiful bastard!

58:45.421 --> 58:47.218
Settle down, for Christ's sake!

58:49.625 --> 58:51.217
Jesus H. Christ!

58:51.961 --> 58:55.658
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
Mary Magdalene

58:55.731 --> 58:58.598
all the saints and martyrs
and Jesus!

58:59.368 --> 59:00.995
Did I say "Jesus"?

59:02.204 --> 59:03.671
Where the hell did
that come from?

59:03.739 --> 59:05.229
I don't know.
When my hand was broke

59:05.307 --> 59:07.571
I had to work down on the
docks and I had to use my left.

59:07.643 --> 59:10.510
So, what?
No, that and luck.

59:10.579 --> 59:12.672
Luck?
Sheer dumb-ass Irish luck.

59:12.748 --> 59:15.012
Don't give me that
luck-of-the-Irish crap. No, sir.

59:15.084 --> 59:18.144
Lucky? That's something you ain't
been in a long time, brother.

59:18.387 --> 59:19.513
Everybody's due.

59:19.588 --> 59:21.385
Due or not, I'll take it.
You had the left.

59:21.457 --> 59:23.220
The left. But you were bouncy.

59:23.659 --> 59:25.923
You were bouncing.

59:27.563 --> 59:31.499
Unbelievable. Sliding,
slipping. You were like a cat.

59:31.567 --> 59:32.966
I did that on hash.

59:33.569 --> 59:36.663
Imagine what I would've done to
him if I'd had a couple of steaks.

59:38.374 --> 59:39.534
Jimmy?

59:40.976 --> 59:42.705
That was one hell of
a good-bye.

59:49.952 --> 59:52.352
Here you go, fellas!
Have at him!

01:00:23.485 --> 01:00:25.146
Jesus Christ!

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.085
Murder him, Maxie!

01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:33.294
Primo!

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.321
This is fighting?

01:00:35.397 --> 01:00:38.093
Why doesn't he just hit him
with a goddamn chair?

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:43.630
Griffin was supposed to fight
Baer next.

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:47.308
He should kiss your ass for
saving him from that thing.

01:01:08.597 --> 01:01:10.326
Throw him down, Maxie!

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:12.998
Give it to him, Maxie!

01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:28.710
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

01:01:28.784 --> 01:01:31.947
<i>the new heavyweight champion
of the world</i>

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.488
<i>Max Baer!</i>

01:01:46.568 --> 01:01:48.297
Come on! He's home.

01:02:16.865 --> 01:02:18.025
I won.

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:22.370
Hooray, he won! I knew you'd win!

01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:27.565
He won, he won, he won!

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.043
Get the silverware.

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:38.448
So was it like you said? Or
are they letting you back in?

01:02:41.423 --> 01:02:43.152
No, baby.
It was just one fight.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.675
All right, I need
seven men, and seven only!

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:04.973
One. Two. Three.

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:12.017
Four. Five.

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:16.084
Thanks.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.588
Braddock!

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.427
Listened in last night.
Was that really you?

01:03:30.739 --> 01:03:31.763
Yeah.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.808
Didn't think
I'd be seeing you back here.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.776
It came up at the last minute,
you know?

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:38.278
It was a one-fight deal.
The purse was $250.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:41.282
My end of that was a little less
than half. It was, like, $123.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.409
We owed $118.
Left me with $5.

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.019
Makes you a rich man, huh?
Around here.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.723
Good fight.
Thanks.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.623
Dock seven.
Seven.

01:03:56.865 --> 01:03:58.696
Hey, Jim.
Hey, Mike.

01:04:04.606 --> 01:04:06.369
Good fight.
Thanks.

01:04:11.947 --> 01:04:14.472
I wouldn't have hit Sara.
I know, Mike.

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:17.113
I couldn't live with myself
if I'd have hit her.

01:04:19.888 --> 01:04:21.879
Just get so angry
with all this shit.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:29.492
You know, if you were gonna
win, you could've told me.

01:04:29.898 --> 01:04:32.458
If I knew I was gonna win,
I would've bet on myself.

01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:36.070
Why can't you ever listen
to me? I don't know.

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:39.701
<i>to determine whether
the strikers were willing</i>

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.936
<i>to submit to
an arbitration situation.</i>

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.374
<i>Tension pervaded the New York
waterfront yesterday.</i>

01:04:46.548 --> 01:04:48.573
Why don't you go play
with the boys, sweetheart?

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:49.639
Be careful.

01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:53.950
Hey, Rosy.
Hi, Daddy!

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:02.990
You know,
Joe Gould was just here.

01:05:03.398 --> 01:05:04.797
Yeah, I saw.
You did?

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:12.072
He thinks the Commission
might be willing to

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.341
reverse their ruling.

01:05:14.409 --> 01:05:16.343
He thinks he can get me
another fight.

01:05:17.112 --> 01:05:20.047
He wants me to stop working
and get back in shape.

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.551
I thought it was
just the one fight.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.252
Well, yeah.

01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:33.522
He fronted us $175
so I can train.

01:05:36.498 --> 01:05:38.295
You know what that is
right there?

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.000
That's a second chance.

01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:42.868
That's what that is.

01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:48.806
It's not that
I'm not grateful

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.911
or proud, honey.
I'm so proud of you.

01:05:55.984 --> 01:05:58.919
But we got off easy
when you broke that hand.

01:06:00.622 --> 01:06:01.953
We're back to even now.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:05.016
Right. And nine months from
now, we're back in the same boat.

01:06:05.093 --> 01:06:06.321
Baby, please.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:09.029
We just don't have anything
left to risk.

01:06:09.097 --> 01:06:10.257
Mae.

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:15.164
There's still some juice in these
legs, and I can still take a few.

01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:16.963
Baby, please.

01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.532
Just let me take them
in the ring.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.407
At least I know
who's hitting me.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.357
I'm gonna go
and tell the kids.

01:06:43.365 --> 01:06:45.765
Jay! Guess what.
What?

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:49.002
I got another fight!
Who with?

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:52.563
I don't know, but he's
going down. Hey, Howard.

01:07:31.146 --> 01:07:32.306
Jesus.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.950
Joe, open the door.

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.622
Joe! Open the damn door!

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:44.686
Don't hide in your fancy
apartment. I want to talk to you.

01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:50.161
You are not gonna make my husband
your punching bag all over again.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.826
We are just getting by, and
you're taking him from his work

01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:55.165
like some bloodsucking
little leech!

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:58.100
And I will not let you get
him hurt again like that

01:07:58.173 --> 01:08:00.698
do you hear me?
I will not let you!

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.779
Guess you better come in.

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.090
How is it?

01:08:19.294 --> 01:08:21.057
Too sweet per usual.

01:08:21.395 --> 01:08:23.057
Really? Go figure.

01:08:23.865 --> 01:08:25.729
Yours? Nice, thanks.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:29.697
Sorry about that.

01:08:32.674 --> 01:08:35.142
You just don't want folks
to see you down is all.

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.372
I didn't know.
I mean, I thought that

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:43.009
Yeah, no. That's the idea.
Always keep your hands up.

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.126
Sold the last of it
two days ago.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:54.557
So Jimmy could train.

01:08:55.796 --> 01:08:57.024
Why?

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:05.469
Sometimes you have
an instinct, Mae.

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.535
You see something
in a fighter.

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:14.571
You don't even know if it's real,
you're looking for it so bad.

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.857
Can't have no hope at all.

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:26.421
But this is crazy.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.191
I mean, you don't even know
if you can get him a fight.

01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:30.629
I'll get him a fight.

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:33.691
Believe me, if it's the last
thing I do, I'll get him a fight.

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:36.237
Honey. Go get us some
of those crackers, would you?

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.337
She looks good
wearing the pants.

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:56.551
Can you ever stop yours?

01:09:57.926 --> 01:09:59.723
When he sets his mind
to a thing?

01:10:04.132 --> 01:10:05.656
I wish I could.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.803
See, I never know
who it's harder on

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.432
them or us.

01:10:12.307 --> 01:10:14.775
We have to wait for them
to fix everything.

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:18.941
And every day

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.047
they feel like
they're failing us.

01:10:25.453 --> 01:10:28.183
And really, it's just the
world that's failed, you know?

01:10:35.263 --> 01:10:38.994
This is a lovely apartment. Thank you.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.429
Now, what am I
gonna go and do that for?

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.568
You saw the papers.

01:10:46.641 --> 01:10:49.667
<i>News had to print extra
copies the day after Braddock's fight.</i>

01:10:49.744 --> 01:10:52.838
People are sentimental, you
know. Some people are sentimental.

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:54.404
Yeah, so tell me why I care.

01:10:55.817 --> 01:10:58.911
You're still sore over the way
Braddock took down Griffin, fine.

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:02.013
I can understand that. It was a
heartbreak for a lot of people.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.717
Yes. But look.

01:11:07.362 --> 01:11:09.421
You got guys fighting
an elimination series

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:12.591
over who gets a shot at Max Baer
for the championship in June.

01:11:12.934 --> 01:11:15.425
John Henry Lewis,
he's your number two in line.

01:11:15.503 --> 01:11:18.529
Now, he already defeated
Braddock once in Frisco, correct?

01:11:19.674 --> 01:11:22.541
Say you put Braddock back
in the game against Lewis.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:25.102
Lewis wins, you get your
revenge on Braddock

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.478
and your boy has gotten
a topflight tune-up

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.143
with full publicity before
Lasky, and what happens?

01:11:30.218 --> 01:11:31.708
You make more money.

01:11:34.956 --> 01:11:38.949
Now, say on the other hand, by
some minute, infinitesimal chance

01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:40.995
God forbid,
Braddock beats Lewis.

01:11:41.062 --> 01:11:42.859
Now you got a sentimental
favorite go up

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.195
and lose against Lasky,
and what happens?

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:46.928
You'll make more money.

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.130
James, either way

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:52.640
you're a richer man with Braddock
back in the ring than if he's not.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:56.275
Come on, don't be foolish. We
both know the name of this game.

01:11:58.146 --> 01:12:00.011
And it sure as hell
ain't "pugilism. "

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.323
They ought to put your mouth
in a circus.

01:12:16.464 --> 01:12:18.091
What do you say?

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:22.234
Don't chase him.
Go around, cut him off.

01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:24.163
Time! James!

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:28.275
I got you a fight.
Yeah?

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.573
You're gonna fight
John Henry Lewis again.

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:31.805
Yeah!

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.370
Joey! I could kiss you!

01:12:33.448 --> 01:12:35.882
No, please,
not in front of the fellas.

01:12:36.117 --> 01:12:38.449
Isn't John Henry
one of Johnston's boys?

01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:40.314
You let me worry about that,
please.

01:12:40.388 --> 01:12:43.516
Now I know why you won't kiss me.
You're all puckered out already.

01:12:44.192 --> 01:12:45.659
Brother, you have no idea.

01:12:46.094 --> 01:12:48.790
Lewis?
Kicked our ass in Frisco.

01:12:48.863 --> 01:12:51.127
Yeah. Hey, Mike.
Who's "our ass" up there?

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:53.326
Joe Gould, Mike Wilson.
Mike Wilson, Joe Gould.

01:12:53.401 --> 01:12:54.527
Hi.

01:12:54.602 --> 01:12:56.536
That guy ain't been beat
in ten fights.

01:12:56.604 --> 01:12:59.630
But you win on a long shot, and
that's a great payday for me.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.701
That's great.
I'll keep that in mind, Mike!

01:13:02.777 --> 01:13:05.644
You got more important things
to think about. Come here.

01:13:06.314 --> 01:13:09.010
Now, I ain't gonna
bullshit you, all right?

01:13:09.517 --> 01:13:11.576
Now, you win one,
I can get you another.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:15.714
Win again and then things maybe
start getting serious around here.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.451
Jimmy?

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.118
Win.

01:13:36.811 --> 01:13:37.903
Look good.

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.312
Leverage.

01:13:50.725 --> 01:13:52.215
That's it, James!

01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:55.126
Be a bully, James!
Aggression, that's it.

01:14:17.218 --> 01:14:18.344
Thanks.

01:14:20.822 --> 01:14:22.687
I know this isn't
what you wanted

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.025
but I can't win
without you behind me.

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.759
I'm always behind you.

01:14:28.963 --> 01:14:30.555
Thank you, baby.

01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:35.602
I got a great idea.
You want to come along?

01:14:36.037 --> 01:14:39.370
Come on, just this one time.
All right. Okay.

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.739
Okay, I'll make that
a rain check then.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:12.472
<i>Lewis, still moving well here
in the fourth.</i>

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.469
<i>He dances in and out
before Braddock can react.</i>

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.081
Don't let him
set the pace, Jimmy!

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:25.675
There you go.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:32.154
<i>Braddock slides to his right,
tries cutting down the ring.</i>

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:44.430
John, get off the ropes.
Move out of there.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.133
<i>Lewis spins his way
off the ropes</i>

01:15:46.207 --> 01:15:48.937
<i>And looks to resume control
at the bell!</i>

01:15:51.646 --> 01:15:54.945
There we go. Suck it up.
Deep breath.

01:15:55.016 --> 01:15:56.677
Deep breath, deep.

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:59.511
All right. That ain't bad. He's
even faster than I remember.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:02.522
Yeah. He's fast. Big deal.
You're not so bad yourself.

01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:05.286
What are you doing? You
beat this guy easy last time.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.726
He ain't the same guy.
You got to use your speed.

01:16:07.795 --> 01:16:10.161
Keep that jab in his face
and keep sliding to his right.

01:16:10.231 --> 01:16:11.892
You see that.
Keep him in front of you.

01:16:11.966 --> 01:16:12.990
Cut him off, all right?

01:16:13.067 --> 01:16:16.093
And let go with the punches.
Hit him! He ain't gonna like it.

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:19.231
I guarantee you, the more
you hit this bastard

01:16:19.307 --> 01:16:20.467
the slower he's gonna get.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:23.033
He's an old man. He's too
slow. He can't keep up with you.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.601
Come on. Use that jab.
How's that cut?

01:16:24.679 --> 01:16:25.668
He's all right.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:26.941
Knock the legs out
from under him.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.415
Trap him in the corner,
and really work him.

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.042
Do not fight this fight his way.

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.383
You make him fight
this fight your way!

01:16:33.454 --> 01:16:34.751
Let's go. You got him.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.154
<i>A left to the body
and a hard right to the head!</i>

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.857
<i>A left-right-left by Lewis.
His dancing shoes are off.</i>

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:45.399
<i>It's a fight now, folks!</i>

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.131
Work his body, Jim!

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.967
<i>Braddock punching well
with both hands now.</i>

01:16:50.989 --> 01:16:53.549
<i>Toe to toe!
No one giving an inch.</i>

01:16:56.661 --> 01:16:58.322
<i>That left has some pop!</i>

01:16:59.164 --> 01:17:01.758
<i>Jimmy's hoping those body shots
will pay dividends.</i>

01:17:02.567 --> 01:17:04.467
Keep him in there! Stay with him!

01:17:06.471 --> 01:17:08.996
Don't give him any room!
No room!

01:17:10.408 --> 01:17:11.841
Get out of the corner.

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:13.935
<i>Braddock pushing
all the action now.</i>

01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:17.812
<i>Lewis can't discourage him.
Tremendous pressure from Jimmy.</i>

01:17:17.882 --> 01:17:21.409
<i>Lewis is running out
of real estate in this 24-foot ring.</i>

01:17:21.653 --> 01:17:22.813
Jump on him!

01:17:24.255 --> 01:17:25.916
<i>And Lewis is down!</i>

01:17:29.928 --> 01:17:31.555
Gotcha. Good boy.

01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:32.994
Get up!

01:17:34.165 --> 01:17:36.360
One. There you go, get up!

01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:38.425
Two.
Come on.

01:17:38.503 --> 01:17:39.902
Three.

01:17:40.805 --> 01:17:43.899
Four. Five.

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:46.635
Six.

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.414
<i>The referee wipes his gloves</i>

01:17:52.483 --> 01:17:54.007
<i>and Braddock steams
back to ring center!</i>

01:17:54.085 --> 01:17:55.382
Close it down.

01:17:56.221 --> 01:17:57.779
<i>Another big right by Braddock!</i>

01:17:57.855 --> 01:18:01.382
<i>Lewis is just a piece of meat
as Braddock is carving him up!</i>

01:18:03.228 --> 01:18:06.527
<i>Braddock is now dominating Lewis!
Here comes Jimmy!</i>

01:18:20.011 --> 01:18:21.876
Side to side!
Side to side!

01:18:22.046 --> 01:18:24.606
<i>In the tenth, riding high
after his dazzling victory</i>

01:18:24.682 --> 01:18:26.081
<i>over John Henry Lewis</i>

01:18:26.184 --> 01:18:29.017
<i>Jim Braddock has just hit
a wall named Art Lasky.</i>

01:18:32.657 --> 01:18:34.352
He can't keep taking
those body shots.

01:18:34.425 --> 01:18:36.825
I know. He's cracked
a couple of ribs for sure.

01:18:39.204 --> 01:18:40.865
<i>Lasky walks through
those jabs</i>

01:18:40.939 --> 01:18:42.907
<i>and keeps working
on Braddock's body.</i>

01:18:42.975 --> 01:18:44.567
<i>But Braddock won't fold!</i>

01:18:44.643 --> 01:18:47.908
<i>He's making Lasky work hard
for every minute of every round.</i>

01:18:48.514 --> 01:18:50.175
That's it, get on him!

01:18:53.485 --> 01:18:56.079
There you go, James!
That's it!

01:19:02.895 --> 01:19:05.125
<i>Lasky's starting to
impose his will.</i>

01:19:05.197 --> 01:19:07.597
<i>He's showing why Jimmy Johnston is
making noises</i>

01:19:07.666 --> 01:19:10.032
<i>about matching him
with Max Baer for the title.</i>

01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:15.405
Break it up!

01:19:16.241 --> 01:19:18.038
Come on. Break free.

01:19:19.445 --> 01:19:20.639
Break.

01:19:27.252 --> 01:19:29.652
Don't sit down. You're
not tired. You're fine.

01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:32.418
Get that thing out of here!
He don't need it!

01:19:32.491 --> 01:19:33.890
Is he looking over at you?

01:19:33.959 --> 01:19:35.984
Shake your head
like you don't need it.

01:19:36.061 --> 01:19:38.495
Shake your head like
you don't want it. There.

01:19:38.564 --> 01:19:41.362
Why isn't he sitting down?
Pay attention.

01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:42.730
Yeah, now he's gonna wonder:

01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:45.395
"If Braddock is such an old
man, why is he still standing?

01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:47.132
Why is he still
coming at me?"

01:19:48.207 --> 01:19:51.404
You're stronger than this guy.
Don't back up! Don't back off!

01:19:52.378 --> 01:19:53.538
This guy is a bull-rusher.

01:19:53.612 --> 01:19:56.479
He's gonna keep coming at you
all night until you stop him.

01:19:56.815 --> 01:19:58.578
He can't back up.
You stop him.

01:19:59.585 --> 01:20:01.416
You gotta beat
this son of a bitch!

01:20:01.487 --> 01:20:04.183
You gotta beat this son of
a bitch from the inside out!

01:20:04.256 --> 01:20:06.156
You hear me?
You gotta get in there.

01:20:06.225 --> 01:20:07.715
You get in there
and you hit him

01:20:07.793 --> 01:20:09.988
and you keep hitting him
until you break his nose.

01:20:10.062 --> 01:20:12.257
You fill his face with blood.

01:20:13.065 --> 01:20:16.364
Beat him from the inside
out, Jim! From the inside out!

01:20:16.902 --> 01:20:18.631

That's more like it!

Back him up!

to put a Grimm ending</i>

<i>Lasky pounding hard shots
to the body.</i>

01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:40.581
<i>Braddock just took
a tremendous shot!</i>

01:20:40.659 --> 01:20:42.854
<i>A hard right to the head which knocked
his mouthpiece</i>

01:20:42.928 --> 01:20:44.088
<i>to the canvas.</i>

01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:15.490
<i>Braddock just took
Lasky's best shot!</i>

01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:17.119
<i>And it didn't even faze him!</i>

01:21:37.449 --> 01:21:39.246
Get in there
and take that sucker!

01:21:40.986 --> 01:21:43.113
<i>He's showing
tremendous determination!</i>

01:21:48.894 --> 01:21:51.055
Right in there

<i>Braddock comes in

North Bergen.</i>

01:22:05.277 --> 01:22:06.835
<i>Braddock is now
back on the attack!</i>

01:22:07.813 --> 01:22:09.576
<i>Another vicious combination
by Braddock!</i>

01:22:09.648 --> 01:22:11.582
<i>And Lasky's flowing blood
from the nose!</i>

01:22:12.217 --> 01:22:14.082
<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

01:22:14.152 --> 01:22:16.143

Thanks, buddy.

01:22:57.963 --> 01:22:59.328
Max? What?

01:23:02.334 --> 01:23:04.097
Save a little bit of it

01:23:04.169 --> 01:23:05.830
Jimmy Braddock
just beat Lasky.

01:23:06.204 --> 01:23:07.865
They made him
the number one contender.

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.635
Max, when are we gonna go to Shut up.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.573
Maxie, you
Shut up!

01:23:19.318 --> 01:23:21.786
I'm not gonna fight Jimmy
Braddock. He's a chump.

01:23:23.121 --> 01:23:27.387
You tell Johnston to bring me
somebody who can fight back.

01:23:27.993 --> 01:23:30.928
You gonna bust your contract?
It's done, Max.

01:23:43.575 --> 01:23:45.634
That's him? Yeah?
Yes, it is.

01:23:45.711 --> 01:23:47.645
I'm telling you. That's Braddock.

01:24:29.788 --> 01:24:31.278
Hey, Mrs. Braddock.

01:24:35.027 --> 01:24:36.460
Sara's here.

01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:38.318
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:24:38.397 --> 01:24:39.762
I got her to sleep.

01:24:41.299 --> 01:24:42.561
Hey, Jim.

01:24:44.936 --> 01:24:46.699
Mike's gone missing.

01:24:47.873 --> 01:24:49.170
How long?

01:24:50.942 --> 01:24:52.341
Three days.

01:24:53.011 --> 01:24:55.571
I've been staying at my
brother's since Jake cut him.

01:24:56.415 --> 01:24:58.940
Jake fired him?
I didn't know that.

01:24:59.151 --> 01:25:03.144
You know how Mike gets.
All his talk. So much trouble.

01:25:05.424 --> 01:25:07.892
He's been sleeping nights
down in the Hooverville.

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.826
My brother didn't have room
for both him and us.

01:25:11.463 --> 01:25:14.455
Mike said, you know, if he had
to stay down there anyway

01:25:14.533 --> 01:25:17.058
he was gonna try
to get everybody organized.

01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:21.137
Something's
wrong, Jim. I know it.

01:25:22.274 --> 01:25:24.799
Now I'm hearing there's
some trouble in Hooverville.

01:25:25.644 --> 01:25:28.044
He wouldn't leave me
and the baby for this long.

01:25:29.781 --> 01:25:31.442
He just wouldn't.

01:25:32.684 --> 01:25:34.777
I didn't know
who else to come to, Jim.

01:25:43.361 --> 01:25:46.159
Come on, out of
the way! Beat it! Move along!

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.674
Get the hell out of here, coppers!

01:26:00.112 --> 01:26:02.137
Mike? Mike Wilson!

01:26:04.382 --> 01:26:05.371
Mike Wilson!

01:26:08.487 --> 01:26:10.853
do nothing. If
you let these Commies in here

01:26:10.922 --> 01:26:13.857
and start a riot, then what
do you think's gonna happen?

01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:15.654
Get over here.

01:26:15.727 --> 01:26:16.716
On your feet!

01:26:17.395 --> 01:26:20.228
You pull a knife on me,
you son of a bitch?

01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:26.495
What the hell happened here?

01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:29.233
We tried to break up
these agitators, peaceful-like

01:26:29.307 --> 01:26:31.207
but they charged us.
What is this?

01:26:31.276 --> 01:26:33.369
The horses got spooked.
Wagons turned over.

01:26:33.445 --> 01:26:35.675
Three or four of them got run
over. They're hurt pretty bad.

01:26:36.248 --> 01:26:38.216
This is a
mess. One hell of a mess.

01:26:38.283 --> 01:26:40.843
What did I tell you?
Get back.

01:26:41.787 --> 01:26:44.119
Don't move those
two. Wait for the stretcher.

01:26:44.756 --> 01:26:46.781
Keep those bastards back!

01:26:49.027 --> 01:26:51.860
Get those guys next,
the ones who got trampled on.

01:26:59.404 --> 01:27:02.237
Hey, Jim.
Mike.

01:27:07.078 --> 01:27:08.545
You're gonna be okay, Mike.

01:27:08.613 --> 01:27:10.205
Yeah, tell Sara.

01:27:11.082 --> 01:27:13.312

gonna be I'll tell Sara.

A lot of people are interested
in this fight.

What do you got to say
to your fans today, Jimmy?

01:28:49.948 --> 01:28:52.382
I guess I'm grateful
for the opportunity.

01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.687
I know that these days not
everybody gets a second chance.

01:29:00.091 --> 01:29:02.116
You know, I have a lot
to be grateful for.

healthy, troublemaking kids.

Can you tell our readers why?

01:29:22.614 --> 01:29:25.208
I believe we live
in a great country.

01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:29.015
A country that's great enough
to help a man financially

01:29:29.087 --> 01:29:30.884
when he's in trouble.

01:29:31.756 --> 01:29:35.852
But lately I have had some good
fortune and I'm back in the black.

01:29:37.562 --> 01:29:39.154

I should return it.

01:29:39.731 --> 01:29:40.959

01:29:41.032 --> 01:29:42.056
Yeah, over here.

Listen, what's the first thing
you're gonna do

01:29:44.202 --> 01:29:45.260
if you make world champion?

01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:49.870
First thing, I'm gonna have
to go and buy some turtles.

01:29:50.008 --> 01:29:51.236
What's that? Turtles?

01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:52.742
Yeah, well,
I said to the kids when

01:29:52.811 --> 01:29:54.278
I was leaving the house
this morning

01:29:54.346 --> 01:29:55.938
that I was gonna
bring back the title

01:29:56.014 --> 01:29:57.811

I said "turtle. "

01:29:59.517 --> 01:30:00.541
Yeah.

01:30:00.618 --> 01:30:02.313
So naturally,
I don't want to let them down.

01:30:02.387 --> 01:30:04.480
But if I could bring home
the title and a turtle

01:30:04.556 --> 01:30:06.456
they sure would be tickled.

01:30:06.524 --> 01:30:08.651

fight for love or money, right?

Well, you
know, the truth is, Jake

01:30:22.507 --> 01:30:24.941
for a number of years there
we was fighting injured.

01:30:25.677 --> 01:30:28.737
I broke my hand
more than once.

01:30:29.647 --> 01:30:32.138

time, we was on the road

Mrs. Braddock, my readers

01:30:58.643 --> 01:31:00.941
how do you feel
about the fact that

01:31:01.346 --> 01:31:03.109

in the ring?

01:31:04.549 --> 01:31:06.346
So how do you feel
about that, ma'am?

01:31:06.951 --> 01:31:08.851
Are you scared
for your husband's life?

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.787
She's scared for Max Baer, is
who she's scared for, Mr. Lewis.

01:31:11.856 --> 01:31:14.950
Okay, how about
one more question, folks?

01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:27.528

to see us.

01:31:27.605 --> 01:31:29.505

Have a seat.

01:31:31.342 --> 01:31:32.707
Right here.

01:31:35.113 --> 01:31:37.138
Editorial says
this fight is good as murder.

01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:41.414
And everybody associated with
it should be hauled into court

01:31:41.486 --> 01:31:43.078
and prosecuted afterwards.

01:31:43.154 --> 01:31:45.281

all sorts of letters

01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:47.221
from people saying
you're their inspiration.

01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:49.021
Like you saved their lives
or something.

01:31:49.094 --> 01:31:51.062
If you ask me,
it's a lot of crap.

01:31:51.429 --> 01:31:53.090
But if I'm gonna
promote this fight

01:31:53.164 --> 01:31:55.826
I'm not getting hung out to
dry if something happens to you.

My brains and my balls
are for business

01:32:01.539 --> 01:32:02.528

Gotcha.

everything in my power to warn you.

You know,
I seen the Carnera fight.

01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:24.888
Carnera's height saved him.

01:32:24.963 --> 01:32:26.760
He was knocked down 12 times.

01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:29.561
Exactly. Would've been worse
if he was shorter.

01:32:29.634 --> 01:32:32.603
Baer had to punch up to hit
him. Took a little something off.

01:32:41.579 --> 01:32:43.171
That's Frankie Campbell.

01:32:43.815 --> 01:32:45.976
Stand-up fighter,
knows how to take a punch.

01:32:47.785 --> 01:32:49.377
His style familiar, Jim?

01:32:50.855 --> 01:32:54.484
Like looking in a mirror, huh?
Hey, he don't need to see this.

01:32:54.559 --> 01:32:56.322
He'll see it
or I'll call off the fight.

01:33:08.006 --> 01:33:09.974
You see that combination?

01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:11.736
Campbell didn't go down
on the first punch.

01:33:11.809 --> 01:33:13.572
He was a tough guy.

01:33:14.379 --> 01:33:17.348
Second one killed him
on the spot.

01:33:24.255 --> 01:33:26.553
Just cut it off, will you?

01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:36.526
The autopsy said that his
brain was knocked loose

01:33:37.068 --> 01:33:38.558
from the connecting tissue.

01:33:41.172 --> 01:33:43.800
Consider your
ass fully covered, okay?

01:33:47.378 --> 01:33:48.868
Run it again.

01:34:54.245 --> 01:34:55.974
Remember Ernie Schaaf?

01:34:56.047 --> 01:34:58.345
Nice guy. You
lost one to him in '31.

01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:01.514
Ernie took one of those
on the chin from Baer.

01:35:01.986 --> 01:35:03.578
He was dead
and didn't know it.

01:35:03.655 --> 01:35:06.647
Next fight, first little nothing
jab put him to sleep forever.

01:35:06.724 --> 01:35:08.123
Detached brain, they said.

01:35:11.029 --> 01:35:12.155
Joe?

01:35:13.498 --> 01:35:14.863
No snappy comeback?

01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:20.095
It ain't my skull the guy's
gonna try and stove in.

01:35:21.139 --> 01:35:22.128
You want to think about it?

01:35:24.976 --> 01:35:26.409
You think
you're telling me something?

01:35:28.313 --> 01:35:31.476
What, like, boxing's
dangerous, something like that?

01:35:33.685 --> 01:35:36.449
You don't think triple shifts or
working nights on the scaffolds

01:35:36.521 --> 01:35:37.954
is just as likely
to get a guy killed?

01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:42.650
How many guys died the other
night living in cardboard shacks

01:35:42.727 --> 01:35:43.785
trying to save on rent money?

01:35:44.796 --> 01:35:47.959
Guys who were trying to feed their
family. 'Cause men like you

01:35:48.032 --> 01:35:50.364
have not yet quite figured out
a way to make money

01:35:50.435 --> 01:35:51.766
out of watching that guy die.

01:35:51.836 --> 01:35:55.203
In my profession,
and it's my profession

01:35:57.141 --> 01:35:58.130
I'm a little more fortunate.

01:36:04.582 --> 01:36:08.177
All righty then. You guys
have dinner here tonight.

01:36:08.686 --> 01:36:10.119
Take your wives. It's on me.

01:36:10.822 --> 01:36:12.187
We'll snap some pics
on your way out.

01:36:13.224 --> 01:36:14.623
If you change your
mind tomorrow

01:36:14.692 --> 01:36:16.421
at least we got some
good press out of it.

01:36:16.494 --> 01:36:18.359
Good. Come on.

01:36:30.375 --> 01:36:32.240
It's gorgeous!

01:36:33.911 --> 01:36:36.106
Jimmy, can we get silver
faucets? Of course.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.171
How many you
want? A dozen? Right.

01:36:38.249 --> 01:36:40.683
Listen. A little bird told me
to check the evening edition.

01:36:40.752 --> 01:36:42.219
So let's see what we got.

01:36:43.287 --> 01:36:45.881
"Boxer Jim Braddock
has come back from the dead

01:36:45.957 --> 01:36:48.858
to change the face of courage
in our nation. "

01:36:49.394 --> 01:36:51.658
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.

01:36:51.763 --> 01:36:54.197
Sporty Lewis wrote that.
Sporty Lewis?

01:36:55.433 --> 01:36:56.957
Yeah. And get this.

01:36:57.301 --> 01:36:59.030
"In a land that's
downtrodden

01:36:59.103 --> 01:37:02.834
"Braddock's comeback is
giving hope to every American.

01:37:04.475 --> 01:37:06.670
"People who were ready
to throw in the towel

01:37:06.744 --> 01:37:10.180
"are finding inspiration in
their new hero, Jim Braddock.

01:37:10.815 --> 01:37:13.215
"As Damon Runyon
has already written

01:37:13.284 --> 01:37:16.742
he's truly
the Cinderella Man. "

01:37:17.588 --> 01:37:19.249
Cinderella Man?
Yeah.

01:37:19.323 --> 01:37:23.191
Oh, I like it. It's kind of
girly. Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

01:37:23.261 --> 01:37:25.627
Oh, brother.
Yeah, this is gonna be fun.

01:37:25.897 --> 01:37:27.762
Excuse me.
Jim.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.967
I'm not quite finished yet.
Beg your pardon, sir.

01:37:32.103 --> 01:37:33.434
Thank you.

01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:36.703
You know what?
I got the bill here. Yeah.

01:37:36.974 --> 01:37:39.966
Johnston. He's a big spender.
He's gonna leave a big, big tip.

01:37:40.044 --> 01:37:41.978
Yeah. He's a real peach.

01:37:42.046 --> 01:37:43.877
Gotta love the guy.
Right, sweetie?

01:37:43.948 --> 01:37:45.711
Look at this.
This is me?

01:37:45.783 --> 01:37:46.772
I know it is.

01:37:50.721 --> 01:37:51.847
Jimmy.

01:38:11.509 --> 01:38:12.601
Oh, boy.

01:38:14.479 --> 01:38:17.846
You think Johnston set that
up? Oh, yeah. I think. Maybe.

01:38:17.915 --> 01:38:20.008
A few extra pics
for the dailies.

01:38:21.452 --> 01:38:23.511
From the gentleman
who just arrived.

01:38:23.588 --> 01:38:26.557
<i>Mr. Baer said
to wish you bon voyage.</i>

01:38:31.262 --> 01:38:33.822
Don't open it. Put it in a
bag. We'll take it with us.

01:38:33.898 --> 01:38:35.456
Hey, Joey?
Yeah?

01:38:35.533 --> 01:38:37.797
Get the coats.
Jim.

01:38:47.411 --> 01:38:49.140
Well,
if it ain't Cinderella Man.

01:38:50.481 --> 01:38:51.971
Thanks for the champagne,
Mr. Baer.

01:38:52.049 --> 01:38:55.212
You're doing a great job publicizing
the fight. I really appreciate it.

01:38:55.286 --> 01:38:58.585
I hope it's gonna be a very
successful night for both of us.

01:38:58.656 --> 01:39:01.147
You keep telling people you're
gonna kill me in the ring.

01:39:02.493 --> 01:39:03.926
I got three kids at home.

01:39:03.995 --> 01:39:06.190
You're upsetting my family,
particularly my wife.

01:39:06.264 --> 01:39:07.788
Listen, Braddock.

01:39:08.566 --> 01:39:11.296
I'm asking you sincerely
not to take this fight.

01:39:11.936 --> 01:39:15.201
Now, you seem like a decent
fellow. People admire you.

01:39:15.573 --> 01:39:16.938
I really don't
want to hurt you.

01:39:18.209 --> 01:39:19.676
It's no joke, pal.

01:39:21.178 --> 01:39:23.339
People die in fairy tales
all the time.

01:39:23.414 --> 01:39:24.904
Hey, Max, how about a picture?

01:39:24.982 --> 01:39:26.244
Hey, Jim! How about a shot?

01:39:26.317 --> 01:39:28.080
There you go. Take it easy. Just smile.

01:39:28.152 --> 01:39:29.483
One more!

01:39:29.687 --> 01:39:32.247
Yeah. I think the smart thing
would be for you to take a fall.

01:39:32.823 --> 01:39:34.950
Circus act's over, old man.

01:39:38.062 --> 01:39:39.689
Right here, Max.
There you go.

01:39:39.764 --> 01:39:42.631
I think I'll go a few rounds
with the dancing Baer.

01:39:42.867 --> 01:39:44.334
Yeah, there you go.

01:39:44.902 --> 01:39:46.961
Come on, Jim.
Very good. Okay.

01:39:47.038 --> 01:39:48.505
Come on.
Okay.

01:39:48.606 --> 01:39:52.098
Hey, we'll see you in the
ring. How about that, champ?

01:39:52.476 --> 01:39:54.000
Come on. Let's go, Jim.

01:39:54.078 --> 01:39:55.739
Max, my wife, Mae.

01:39:56.314 --> 01:39:57.645
You ought to talk to him, Mae.

01:39:58.482 --> 01:40:00.575
You are far too pretty
to be a widow.

01:40:02.486 --> 01:40:04.477
That's not nice, Max.
Not nice. Come on.

01:40:04.555 --> 01:40:07.319
On second thought, maybe I can
comfort you after he's gone.

01:40:07.391 --> 01:40:10.451
Hey, I said shut your
goddamn mouth, you punk!

01:40:16.233 --> 01:40:18.599
Sorry.
Send me the cleaning bill.

01:40:19.937 --> 01:40:21.404
Get that, boys?

01:40:21.806 --> 01:40:24.104
Now he's got his wife
doing his fighting for him.

01:40:28.679 --> 01:40:30.704
Yeah. Ain't she something?

01:40:35.586 --> 01:40:36.814
All right. Get me a drink.

01:40:48.132 --> 01:40:50.259
All right.
Three-punch combo, okay?

01:40:50.668 --> 01:40:52.863
Pop, pop, bang. Come on.

01:40:55.006 --> 01:40:55.995
Yeah.

01:40:56.073 --> 01:40:57.973
Oh, that's good.
One more time.

01:40:58.042 --> 01:41:00.840
Keep your thumbs tucked in.
Keep your elbows in.

01:41:00.978 --> 01:41:02.878
All right.
That's enough, now.

01:41:02.947 --> 01:41:04.312
There's some sting in that.

01:41:04.382 --> 01:41:05.781
That's enough, please.

01:41:05.850 --> 01:41:07.784
Good. Yeah, that's good. Bang!

01:41:10.287 --> 01:41:12.016
I want a turn, Dad. All right.

01:41:12.089 --> 01:41:14.353
Hey, where's your defense?
Come on, get your hand up.

01:41:14.425 --> 01:41:15.414
I want a turn.

01:41:17.695 --> 01:41:19.822
Left, right,
left. Pop, pop, bang.

01:41:24.835 --> 01:41:26.496
Come on, Howie.

01:41:28.406 --> 01:41:31.204
All right, that's enough!
No boxing in the house!

01:41:31.475 --> 01:41:33.375
No boxing out of the house.
All right?

01:41:33.444 --> 01:41:35.105
No boxing. Period!

01:41:35.813 --> 01:41:37.303
You're gonna stay in school.

01:41:37.381 --> 01:41:38.609
Then you're gonna go
to college

01:41:38.683 --> 01:41:40.116
and you're gonna have
professions.

01:41:40.184 --> 01:41:43.415
Because you're not gonna have
your skulls smashed in, too!

01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:45.955
Do you understand me?
Is that clear?

01:41:54.699 --> 01:41:57.998
Hey, why don't you boys go and
get ready for bed, all right?

01:42:21.358 --> 01:42:22.985
I used to pray

01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:26.695
for you to get hurt
just enough

01:42:28.032 --> 01:42:30.091
so you couldn't fight anymore.

01:42:30.968 --> 01:42:34.529
And when they took your license
away, even scared as I was

01:42:34.805 --> 01:42:38.104
I went to the church
and I thanked God for it.

01:42:38.909 --> 01:42:40.536
'Cause I always knew

01:42:40.644 --> 01:42:44.102
a day might come
when it could kill you.

01:42:44.682 --> 01:42:47.412
I just knew it, Jimmy.
And now it's here.

01:42:47.485 --> 01:42:49.180
You just got the jitters,
that's all.

01:42:49.253 --> 01:42:52.051
He's killed two men, Jimmy!
What's worth it?

01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:57.659
I have to believe I got some
kind of say over our lives. Okay?

01:42:58.329 --> 01:43:00.854
You know, that if things are
bad, that we can change them

01:43:00.931 --> 01:43:02.899
we can make things better
for our family.

01:43:02.967 --> 01:43:06.403
But I need you to be safe

01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:07.937
Nothing's safe anymore, Mae.
so much.

01:43:08.005 --> 01:43:08.994
And without that

01:43:09.073 --> 01:43:11.303
I need you to be safe!
nothing's safe at all.

01:43:11.375 --> 01:43:12.569
All right.

01:43:12.643 --> 01:43:15.510
I have stood by for all of it.

01:43:16.614 --> 01:43:17.945
Until now.

01:43:19.617 --> 01:43:22.711
Not for this, Jimmy.
I just can't.

01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:25.851
So you train all you want.

01:43:25.923 --> 01:43:28.858
Make a show of it
for yourself, for the papers.

01:43:29.326 --> 01:43:31.692
But you find a way
out of that fight.

01:43:31.829 --> 01:43:34.354
Break your hand again
if you have to.

01:43:50.047 --> 01:43:51.036
Is he all right?

01:43:58.155 --> 01:43:59.713
So, how's he doing?

01:44:00.357 --> 01:44:02.552
He's old. He's arthritic.

01:44:02.827 --> 01:44:05.387
And his ribs haven't been
right since the Lasky fight.

01:44:06.096 --> 01:44:08.087
What's the bad news,
sunshine?

01:44:08.999 --> 01:44:10.057
Joe!
What?

01:44:10.134 --> 01:44:12.068
The reporters are here.
Jesus.

01:44:12.136 --> 01:44:14.434
Right. Get rid of that
goddamn rib protector.

01:44:14.505 --> 01:44:16.769
Jimmy!
Press is here, boy-o!

01:44:16.841 --> 01:44:18.433
Get bouncing around
in that ring!

01:44:18.509 --> 01:44:21.342
Showtime! Big smiles!
You're the belle of the ball!

01:44:21.412 --> 01:44:24.074
Baer don't need to know
about no goddamn ribs.

01:45:53.871 --> 01:45:55.133
Bye, Dad.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.687
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:35.267
Hey, look. It's him.

01:46:36.413 --> 01:46:37.573
There's Braddock!

01:46:41.719 --> 01:46:43.846
Maybe this
is your day, Bulldog!

01:46:43.921 --> 01:46:46.321
Look, it's him!
It's Jimmy, look, right there!

01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:49.052
We're with you, Jimmy! You're
gonna beat him, Bulldog!

01:46:54.531 --> 01:46:57.432
Well, look who's
here. Hi, Aunt Alice.

01:46:57.501 --> 01:46:58.968
Come on in.

01:47:00.137 --> 01:47:01.866
No radio, all right?

01:47:02.906 --> 01:47:05.636
Yeah, sure.
All right. Be back soon.

01:47:27.731 --> 01:47:30.928
Hello, Mae.
I came to pray for Jim.

01:47:33.437 --> 01:47:35.098
So did they.

01:47:36.273 --> 01:47:37.365
Yeah.

01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:49.451
They all think
that Jim's fighting for them.

01:48:49.379 --> 01:48:50.437
Hey.

01:48:53.317 --> 01:48:54.341
Yeah?

01:48:54.451 --> 01:48:56.578
Who beat that
John Henry Lewis?

01:48:59.857 --> 01:49:02.087
That Braddock guy.
Correct.

01:49:03.527 --> 01:49:05.620
Who whupped that
Art Lasky punk?

01:49:06.029 --> 01:49:08.293
James J. Braddock.
Correct again.

01:49:08.932 --> 01:49:10.559
Now, refresh me
on this one.

01:49:10.634 --> 01:49:13.899
Who was it took that Corn Griffin
and turned him inside out

01:49:13.971 --> 01:49:16.769
with no questions asked?
Who was that?

01:49:17.808 --> 01:49:18.797
I used to think it was me

01:49:18.876 --> 01:49:20.309
but now I'm kinda thinking
it was you.

01:49:20.377 --> 01:49:22.811
No, don't you
sell yourself short.

01:49:23.647 --> 01:49:27.014
At some stage, you think maybe
you're gonna do some taping here?

01:49:28.118 --> 01:49:29.676
Why not?

01:49:35.592 --> 01:49:38.459
All right, let's see.
How's that?

01:49:40.297 --> 01:49:41.423
What?

01:50:00.951 --> 01:50:02.418
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:50:11.094 --> 01:50:13.619
You can't win
without me behind you.

01:50:16.867 --> 01:50:19.267
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

01:50:28.812 --> 01:50:30.837
Maybe I understand some.

01:50:31.982 --> 01:50:33.847
About having to fight.

01:50:35.419 --> 01:50:38.149
So you just remember
who you are.

01:50:39.289 --> 01:50:41.780
You're the
Bulldog of Bergen

01:50:41.858 --> 01:50:44.258
and the pride of New Jersey.

01:50:45.062 --> 01:50:46.996
You're everybody's hope.

01:50:48.298 --> 01:50:50.391
And you're your kids' hero.

01:50:51.868 --> 01:50:55.998
And you are
the champion of my heart

01:50:56.206 --> 01:50:57.867
James J. Braddock.

01:51:07.918 --> 01:51:10.011
You know,
you better get home.

01:51:11.154 --> 01:51:13.645
You know, boxers hang around
places like this

01:51:13.724 --> 01:51:16.659
and you don't want to get tangled
up with that kind of crowd.

01:51:16.727 --> 01:51:19.992
Nice girl like you.
Yeah, okay.

01:51:21.732 --> 01:51:23.495
I'll see you at home.

01:51:29.806 --> 01:51:31.296
Please, Jimmy.

01:51:33.577 --> 01:51:35.374
I'll see you at home?

01:51:37.347 --> 01:51:38.905
See you at home, baby.

01:51:59.002 --> 01:52:01.698
<i>From the ringside of the
Madison Square Garden Bowl.</i>

01:52:01.772 --> 01:52:03.239
<i>Tonight, our coast-to-coast
hookup</i>

01:52:03.307 --> 01:52:05.605
<i>brings you the biggest
pugilistic event of the year.</i>

01:52:05.676 --> 01:52:08.668
<i>Max Baer versus the Cinderella Man,
Jimmy Braddock.</i>

01:52:10.714 --> 01:52:11.908
<i>And in a few moments</i>

01:52:11.982 --> 01:52:14.143
<i>the contestants for
tonight's championship bout</i>

01:52:14.217 --> 01:52:16.378
<i>will be making their way
to the ring.</i>

01:52:37.708 --> 01:52:39.232
God Almighty.

01:52:47.517 --> 01:52:49.508
<i>Jim Braddock's rise
from the soup lines</i>

01:52:49.586 --> 01:52:52.919
<i>to number one heavyweight contender
has truly been miraculous.</i>

01:52:52.989 --> 01:52:56.755
<i>No, never in all my years
have I seen this arena so quiet.</i>

01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:27.452
You can do it, Jimmy!

01:53:35.499 --> 01:53:38.093
<i>James J. Braddock,
the Cinderella Man</i>

01:53:38.168 --> 01:53:40.363
<i>who just a year ago
was standing in a bread line.</i>

01:53:40.437 --> 01:53:42.598
<i>Braddock's a tremendous
underdog with the bettors</i>

01:53:42.672 --> 01:53:45.004
<i>but you wouldn't know it
from the reaction of the crowd.</i>

01:53:45.075 --> 01:53:48.272
<i>Madison Square Garden is on its feet
and the noise is deafening!</i>

01:53:48.345 --> 01:53:50.905
<i>An astonishing crowd is
gathered here this evening.</i>

01:53:50.981 --> 01:53:53.506
<i>I saw people lining up to buy
tickets tonight who looked</i>

01:53:53.583 --> 01:53:55.278
<i>as if they were spending
their last dollar.</i>

01:53:55.352 --> 01:53:57.946
<i>But they're here now
and 35,000 strong!</i>

01:53:58.021 --> 01:53:59.318
<i>Listen to them!</i>

01:54:18.575 --> 01:54:20.805
<i>We understand Max Baer
has left his dressing room.</i>

01:54:20.877 --> 01:54:22.071
<i>There he is.</i>

01:54:22.312 --> 01:54:24.746
<i>Max Baer has the look and swagger of
a Hollywood star.</i>

01:54:24.981 --> 01:54:26.778
<i>Tonight, though,
there'll be no play-acting</i>

01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:30.047
<i>not with Jim Braddock in the ring.
This fight is for real.</i>

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:33.112
<i>The table's been set.
Let's get to the main course.</i>

01:54:37.294 --> 01:54:38.784
Gentlemen,
I gave you the rules

01:54:38.862 --> 01:54:39.829
in the dressing room.

01:54:39.896 --> 01:54:41.363
One minute to midnight,
Cinderella.

01:54:41.431 --> 01:54:42.921
Yeah? Your clock's
about ticked out, asshole.

01:54:42.999 --> 01:54:44.694
I'm here to enforce them.
I want clean breaks.

01:54:44.768 --> 01:54:46.360
Tell laughing boy here,
no backhanding.

01:54:46.436 --> 01:54:48.461
I don't want any backhanding
and hitting on the breakaway.

01:54:48.538 --> 01:54:50.301
No low blows!
I'll take care of this, Joe.

01:54:50.373 --> 01:54:52.841
You understand? You tell this
bohunk no grabbing, no manhandling.

01:54:52.909 --> 01:54:54.843
Watch your goddamn language,
you nasty little shit.

01:54:54.911 --> 01:54:56.276
Look at this! No low
blows means no low blows.

01:54:56.346 --> 01:54:58.007
You gonna let this little
prick talk to me like that?

01:54:58.081 --> 01:55:00.208
No hitting on the
breaks. It talks!

01:55:00.283 --> 01:55:02.308
Holy mackerel, it talks!
Look at that!

01:55:02.385 --> 01:55:04.478
Keep your hands up at all
times to protect yourselves.

01:55:04.554 --> 01:55:06.613
Now, touch gloves
and come out fighting.

01:55:06.690 --> 01:55:08.624
Good luck. Go to your corners.

01:55:08.692 --> 01:55:11.388
I'm gonna kick his Mick balls
up to the roof of his mouth.

01:55:11.461 --> 01:55:13.929
That ought to be
a familiar taste for him, huh?

01:55:16.099 --> 01:55:17.691
Come on, Jimmy boy!

01:55:19.803 --> 01:55:23.102
Yeah, boys, get some
pictures here! Come on!

01:55:32.082 --> 01:55:34.880
You can do this.
This guy is made for you.

01:55:35.585 --> 01:55:37.553
Have a picnic, all right?

01:55:42.058 --> 01:55:44.652
<i>There's the bell!
And the fight is on!</i>

01:55:52.168 --> 01:55:53.328
<i>The boys come out</i>

01:55:53.403 --> 01:55:56.429
<i>and immediately Braddock
shoots a left to Maxie's jaw!</i>

01:55:58.308 --> 01:56:01.209
That's it!
Take it right to him, Jimmy!

01:56:03.013 --> 01:56:04.139
Now, now.

01:56:04.548 --> 01:56:07.346
<i>Baer snaps Braddock's head
back with two right uppercuts.</i>

01:56:07.751 --> 01:56:10.811
<i>It's always a question of which
Max will show up in the first round</i>

01:56:10.887 --> 01:56:12.582
<i>the killer or the clown?</i>

01:56:20.196 --> 01:56:21.663
<i>Maxie doing well.</i>

01:56:21.731 --> 01:56:24.495
<i>It looks like he's enjoying himself,
mugging for the crowd.</i>

01:56:24.568 --> 01:56:26.126
Take it into him!

01:56:27.037 --> 01:56:29.665
<i>A big flurry by Braddock!
A vicious right to the head!</i>

01:56:38.648 --> 01:56:42.311
Take it easy, pal. I'll let
it go a couple of rounds.

01:56:42.385 --> 01:56:45.286
<i>Madcap Maxie is heavily favored to put
the long snore on Braddock</i>

01:56:45.355 --> 01:56:46.379
<i>in the first round.</i>

01:56:46.456 --> 01:56:48.219
<i>That big right hand of his
has dynamite in it</i>

01:56:48.291 --> 01:56:50.282
<i>especially when he traps
his man on the ropes.</i>

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.885
He's gonna carry him
for a couple of rounds.

01:56:56.833 --> 01:56:58.232
Braddock! Break it up!

01:56:58.301 --> 01:57:00.030
Break it up, I said!

01:57:01.504 --> 01:57:03.096
Go on, Jimmy!

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.802
<i>Jim survived the round and
looked pretty good doing it.</i>

01:57:06.876 --> 01:57:09.310
<i>Braddock will not be bullied.
Not tonight.</i>

01:57:09.379 --> 01:57:11.279
When he does this horseshit,
knock it off.

01:57:11.348 --> 01:57:12.815
He's trying to thumb you.
All right?

01:57:12.882 --> 01:57:15.851
And then slip inside of there
and shorten up the punches.

01:57:15.919 --> 01:57:18.387
All right? Shorten them up.
That's your turf!

01:57:18.455 --> 01:57:20.252
Inside is yours!

01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:21.682
Good job, Braddock!

01:57:21.925 --> 01:57:22.914
Come on, Braddock!

01:57:23.259 --> 01:57:25.955
<i>Well, no one expected Braddock
to go past the first round.</i>

01:57:26.029 --> 01:57:27.621
Shorten them up.
Stay inside of him.

01:57:27.697 --> 01:57:29.631
<i>The experts at ringside
were wrong again.</i>

01:57:29.699 --> 01:57:31.530
<i>Shorten them up!
There's the bell!</i>

01:57:31.601 --> 01:57:33.796
<i>And here we are
in the second round.</i>

01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:35.662
That had some salt on it!

01:57:35.739 --> 01:57:38.469
<i>Braddock lands a hard right
to the head.</i>

01:57:38.675 --> 01:57:41.143
<i>Max swats him away
with cool contempt!</i>

01:57:41.611 --> 01:57:43.476
<i>He appears to be
toying with Braddock.</i>

01:57:43.546 --> 01:57:45.207
<i>There's no other word for it.</i>

01:57:45.281 --> 01:57:48.739
<i>Max struts around the ring
without a care in the world.</i>

01:57:52.322 --> 01:57:55.120
Sharp, efficient,
tough, and short! Good.

01:57:59.829 --> 01:58:01.421
Knock that on out.

01:58:02.365 --> 01:58:04.833
<i>And Max responds with
swinging rights and lefts.</i>

01:58:04.901 --> 01:58:06.892
<i>All power punches from Maxie.</i>

01:58:14.177 --> 01:58:15.201
Break him!

01:58:15.278 --> 01:58:18.441
<i>And Braddock punches
right to the head!</i>

01:58:23.553 --> 01:58:24.781
Cover up!

01:58:26.723 --> 01:58:28.350
Is that the right spot, Jimmy?

01:58:28.425 --> 01:58:30.120
All right. Break it up!

01:58:30.193 --> 01:58:32.093
Break it up, you two!
Stay clean!

01:58:41.271 --> 01:58:44.570
How are those ribs?
Okay. All right. Take it easy.

01:58:44.641 --> 01:58:47.075
Good pace. Good pace,
Jim. Take it easy. Just breathe.

01:58:47.143 --> 01:58:50.169
Deep breaths. Relax.
Good rhythm.

01:58:50.246 --> 01:58:51.941
You're looking great
out there, Jimmy.

01:58:52.015 --> 01:58:53.482
Yeah.
You look great.

01:58:53.550 --> 01:58:57.179
Hey, Jim?
If he goes for your body

01:58:57.253 --> 01:58:59.483
drop the elbows on him.
Teach him a lesson.

01:58:59.556 --> 01:59:01.023
Break his goddamn hand.

01:59:01.091 --> 01:59:02.615
<i>That round was tough to score.</i>

01:59:02.692 --> 01:59:04.853
<i>Braddock landed several surprising
right hands.</i>

01:59:04.928 --> 01:59:06.953
<i>And those thunderous
body punches by the champ</i>

01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:09.760
<i>should pay dividends
in the later rounds.</i>

01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:13.692
<i>In the fifth,
Baer's smile is gone.</i>

01:59:15.638 --> 01:59:16.662
Yeah, that's it!

01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:18.264
<i>Jimmy comes in
with a hard right</i>

01:59:18.341 --> 01:59:20.707
<i>then neatly slides off
to Baer's left.</i>

01:59:21.211 --> 01:59:24.305
<i>Avoiding the counterpunch,
Jimmy sticks a jab.</i>

01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:30.417
<i>And now the crowd is jeering
and even laughing at the champ.</i>

01:59:30.487 --> 01:59:32.352
<i>And Maxie's none too pleased.</i>

01:59:32.622 --> 01:59:33.850
All right, break it.

01:59:33.923 --> 01:59:35.584
Break!

01:59:36.192 --> 01:59:38.422
<i>Baer backhands Braddock
across the face!</i>

01:59:38.495 --> 01:59:39.519
<i>That'll cost Maxie.</i>

01:59:39.596 --> 01:59:41.257
You lousy shegetz!

01:59:41.331 --> 01:59:42.593
That's a warning, Max.

01:59:44.467 --> 01:59:45.798
I'm sorry.

01:59:47.904 --> 01:59:49.531
How's that wife of yours?

01:59:49.606 --> 01:59:50.766
Break!

01:59:54.978 --> 01:59:57.242
She talk about me?
Knock off the wrestling.

01:59:57.313 --> 01:59:58.405
All right. Break it up!

01:59:58.481 --> 01:59:59.539
Quit fooling around, Max!

02:00:03.019 --> 02:00:04.350
Low blow!

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:05.614
What was that?

02:00:05.688 --> 02:00:08.452
Keep them up. Wake up,
you wet son of a bitch!

02:00:13.663 --> 02:00:16.791
<i>Max salutes the crowd.
He's one of a kind, folks.</i>

02:00:17.133 --> 02:00:19.101
She say my name in her sleep?

02:00:20.670 --> 02:00:23.366
<i>Baer took a chin-full of Braddock's head
in that clinch.</i>

02:00:23.439 --> 02:00:25.339
That's it! Work his body!

02:00:29.479 --> 02:00:30.571
She miss me?

02:00:30.647 --> 02:00:32.774
<i>Baer grips Braddock's head
in a headlock.</i>

02:00:32.849 --> 02:00:36.114
Jesus! Hey, Maxila you
gonna punch him or pork him?

02:00:36.186 --> 02:00:37.676
That's your job, asshole.

02:00:37.754 --> 02:00:39.016
<i>Jimmy fights his way free.</i>

02:00:39.088 --> 02:00:40.680
<i>Hey, buddy
Gets a shot in to the head.</i>

02:00:40.757 --> 02:00:41.781
You kidding me?
Fantastic!

02:00:43.426 --> 02:00:44.791
You're gonna get hurt.

02:00:45.562 --> 02:00:49.259
<i>Braddock keeps punching.
They hammer each other, toe to toe.</i>

02:00:49.866 --> 02:00:51.857
<i>Okay, break!
There's the bell!</i>

02:00:53.837 --> 02:00:55.828
Keep your hands up
and your mouth shut, Maxie.

02:00:55.905 --> 02:00:58.430
You watching the fight or
the cute guy in the front row?

02:00:58.508 --> 02:01:01.306
Take a seat, Maxie!
He's nothing, nobody.

02:01:01.377 --> 02:01:02.776
The guy has got nothing!

02:01:02.846 --> 02:01:04.438
Jesus! Sit down!

02:01:06.749 --> 02:01:08.239
Give me the sponge.

02:01:08.551 --> 02:01:10.382
What are you doing?
Don't worry about it.

02:01:10.453 --> 02:01:14.082
Well, quit screwing around.
Hey! Relax.

02:01:14.624 --> 02:01:16.524
Give me the goddamn water.

02:01:22.365 --> 02:01:24.060
Ten seconds!

02:01:34.544 --> 02:01:36.944
Hit this guy. Cut him!

02:01:37.647 --> 02:01:40.081
You cut him
down to size. Cut him!

02:01:42.218 --> 02:01:43.480
Oh, shit.

02:01:44.053 --> 02:01:46.214
<i>In the seventh,
the boys come out again.</i>

02:01:46.289 --> 02:01:48.450
<i>And Max is all business now.</i>

02:01:50.593 --> 02:01:52.083
Put him away, Max! Get him!

02:01:52.161 --> 02:01:54.629
Attaboy, Maxie! Attaboy!

02:01:54.697 --> 02:01:56.426
Slide it, Jimmy!

02:01:58.001 --> 02:01:59.901
<i>Braddock starting
to look his age here</i>

02:01:59.969 --> 02:02:02.130
<i>as Baer pushes him
around the ring.</i>

02:02:02.605 --> 02:02:04.163
<i>Baer swings hard to the body.</i>

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:06.435
<i>Braddock gets in a right
to the head.</i>

02:02:06.809 --> 02:02:08.401
Murder him, Maxie!

02:02:17.954 --> 02:02:19.683
Jesus Christ.

02:02:19.822 --> 02:02:21.915
<i>Baer with a tremendous shot
right there!</i>

02:02:21.991 --> 02:02:24.323
<i>That was the hardest blow
in the fight!</i>

02:02:29.365 --> 02:02:30.389
Oh, Christ.

02:02:30.466 --> 02:02:31.797
<i>Baer turns him again</i>

02:02:31.868 --> 02:02:34.632
<i>with another right to the head.
Another right. And another.</i>

02:02:42.211 --> 02:02:43.906
Push him, push him!

02:02:55.058 --> 02:02:57.253
<i>Braddock gets in
a vicious uppercut.</i>

02:02:59.095 --> 02:03:00.494
<i>Baer keeps on punching!</i>

02:03:00.563 --> 02:03:01.928
Jesus, Johnny!

02:03:01.998 --> 02:03:04.694
Let him go! That's enough!
Break it up!

02:03:05.201 --> 02:03:07.032
You're gonna go home
in butcher paper, pal!

02:03:07.103 --> 02:03:09.298
To your
corners! Butcher paper!

02:03:13.309 --> 02:03:15.539
All right.
Let me see that nose.

02:03:16.045 --> 02:03:17.410
Get it out. You're okay.

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.674
Let me see it.
Tilt your head back.

02:03:18.748 --> 02:03:20.443
That's nothing.
That's a piece of cake.

02:03:20.516 --> 02:03:22.484
Keep your head up.
Breathe through your mouth.

02:03:22.552 --> 02:03:23.917
Breathe.

02:03:23.987 --> 02:03:26.478
You got all your ugly friends
down from Jersey here.

02:03:26.556 --> 02:03:28.581
They're dressed up nice.
They've come to see you.

02:03:28.658 --> 02:03:32.025
You're putting them to sleep.
You're not turning him anymore.

02:03:32.095 --> 02:03:34.859
Come on, pick it up.
Spit that out, boy-o.

02:03:35.999 --> 02:03:38.900
Good boy.

02:03:39.802 --> 02:03:41.133
Come on.

02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:46.106
<i>The boys go after each other
immediately.</i>

02:03:46.676 --> 02:03:48.576
<i>Braddock gets in a left to the body.
And a hard right</i>

02:03:48.644 --> 02:03:50.339
<i>Mae.
to Max's head.</i>

02:03:50.413 --> 02:03:52.142
<i>Baer comes swinging across
with a long, swinging</i>

02:03:52.215 --> 02:03:54.206
<i>It's the cops.
right to Braddock's head.</i>

02:03:54.917 --> 02:03:56.475
<i>Braddock stumbles away.</i>

02:03:56.552 --> 02:03:58.417
<i>Baer tries that right again!</i>

02:03:59.155 --> 02:04:02.056
<i>They come together.
Braddock swings a left and a right.</i>

02:04:02.125 --> 02:04:03.217
Please, Ma.

02:04:03.292 --> 02:04:05.317
<i>Max comes back with a left and
a right of his own.</i>

02:04:05.395 --> 02:04:07.829
<i>Braddock sticks out a left!
Baer still after him.</i>

02:04:07.897 --> 02:04:08.955
<i>Another left!</i>

02:04:09.032 --> 02:04:12.160
<i>And a hard right by Braddock
that rocked Baer for a moment!</i>

02:04:12.235 --> 02:04:14.066
<i>Baer tries that right again.</i>

02:04:17.707 --> 02:04:19.072
<i>A hard right
to Braddock's head!</i>

02:04:19.142 --> 02:04:21.872
<i>Braddock is hurt.
His legs are gone.</i>

02:04:29.919 --> 02:04:32.319
<i>Braddock sticks out a left!
Another left!</i>

02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:39.922
<i>Neither man will back down!
It's a slugfest, folks!</i>

02:04:39.996 --> 02:04:41.725
<i>And there's the bell!</i>

02:04:42.932 --> 02:04:45.560
<i>James J. Braddock has exhibited
a lot of heart here</i>

02:04:45.635 --> 02:04:48.263
<i>over 11 grueling rounds
with the champion.</i>

02:04:48.337 --> 02:04:51.670
<i>Nobody expected him to last
more than a few innings with Baer.</i>

02:04:51.741 --> 02:04:54.642
<i>Yet here he is.
And he's held his own.</i>

02:04:55.211 --> 02:04:58.112
<i>But now we head
into the championship rounds, folks.</i>

02:05:00.983 --> 02:05:03.850
Hey, Jim, look at me.

02:05:05.822 --> 02:05:08.985
I swear to God, boy,
win, lose or draw

02:05:09.592 --> 02:05:11.992
Thanks, Joey.
For all of it.

02:05:13.796 --> 02:05:16.697
You son of a bitch.
All right. Stop talking.

02:05:16.766 --> 02:05:18.097
Get in there!

02:05:19.035 --> 02:05:20.559
And bury him!

02:05:20.636 --> 02:05:22.103
Finish him off.

02:05:22.271 --> 02:05:23.704
Come on, Jimmy!

02:05:29.812 --> 02:05:31.871
<i>Here in the 12th,
James J. Braddock</i>

02:05:31.948 --> 02:05:34.712
<i>is showing this crowd
what heart is all about.</i>

02:05:42.191 --> 02:05:44.056
<i>Jimmy seems to be
timing that left</i>

02:05:44.127 --> 02:05:46.391
<i>and has slapped it away
several times.</i>

02:05:50.533 --> 02:05:53.593
Keep moving, boy-o!
You stay with him!

02:05:54.203 --> 02:05:55.534
Son of a bitch!

02:05:56.139 --> 02:05:59.108
<i>Braddock with a shoeshine.
Left, right!</i>

02:05:59.442 --> 02:06:01.569
Am I seeing what I'm seeing?

02:06:01.844 --> 02:06:03.778
Finish him, Jimmy. Finish him!

02:06:03.846 --> 02:06:05.837
Braddock, Braddock!

02:06:15.024 --> 02:06:17.891
<i>Maxie's glamour-boy smile
is now a bloody grimace.</i>

02:06:19.262 --> 02:06:22.129
<i>This crowd is desperately
hoping for a Braddock victory.</i>

02:06:22.198 --> 02:06:25.361
<i>But Mr. Baer might have something to say
about that.</i>

02:06:28.738 --> 02:06:30.069
Holy crap!

02:06:36.345 --> 02:06:37.573
Low blow!

02:06:37.647 --> 02:06:39.842
That last low blow
will cost you the round, Max.

02:06:39.916 --> 02:06:41.679
Jesus!
It'll cost you the round.

02:06:43.486 --> 02:06:45.545
Why don't you just kick him
in the balls, huh?

02:06:45.621 --> 02:06:46.610
Joe, back in your corner!

02:06:46.689 --> 02:06:48.816
What are you afraid of,
you son of a bitch?

02:06:48.891 --> 02:06:50.222
Get back to your corner!

02:06:52.962 --> 02:06:54.452
Come on, Ref!

02:06:55.932 --> 02:06:59.197
<i>McAvoy is on the verge of
losing control of this fight.</i>

02:07:03.573 --> 02:07:05.666
Knock him on the ground, Bulldog!

02:07:08.144 --> 02:07:10.112
Last round.
That's right! Next champ!

02:07:10.179 --> 02:07:12.044
You better worry about Baer's
corner in this next round.

02:07:12.114 --> 02:07:13.308
You know what I mean.

02:07:13.382 --> 02:07:16.078
You won this one.
It's a cinch. It is yours.

02:07:17.353 --> 02:07:20.322
But I want you to play it
cagey now. All right?

02:07:20.623 --> 02:07:22.386
I know you don't like
laying back

02:07:22.458 --> 02:07:24.585
but I want you to stay away
from his right

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:26.753
do you understand me?
Stay away.

02:07:27.129 --> 02:07:28.426
Right hand.

02:07:28.664 --> 02:07:31.861
You're behind.
Are you listening to me?

02:07:31.934 --> 02:07:35.131
You want to lose the championship
to this goddamn nobody?

02:07:35.404 --> 02:07:36.769
Hey. Come on, Jimmy!

02:07:36.839 --> 02:07:38.170
This is your night.

02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:42.601
Stay away. Put him down!

02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:46.878
Use your right hand.
Right hand.

02:07:52.421 --> 02:07:55.390
Ten seconds!
Come on now. Finish him.

02:07:59.295 --> 02:08:02.287
It's the last round,
Jimmy. There ain't no more.

02:08:02.932 --> 02:08:06.732
You play this bastard smart
and they can't take it from you!

02:08:16.112 --> 02:08:17.943
<i>One more round to go, folks.</i>

02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.775
<i>McAvoy stands
at center ring</i>

02:08:19.849 --> 02:08:22.044
<i>waiting for the fighters
to join him.</i>

02:08:43.472 --> 02:08:44.905
Touch gloves.

02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:49.200
<i>The boys touch gloves
at center ring.</i>

02:08:50.179 --> 02:08:51.476
<i>And now they're right
back at it.</i>

02:08:51.547 --> 02:08:52.809
Oh, no, Jimmy!

02:08:55.318 --> 02:08:56.683
Leave him alone!

02:08:58.287 --> 02:09:00.016
Stay away from him!

02:09:00.456 --> 02:09:01.946
That ain't laying back!

02:09:02.024 --> 02:09:03.924
<i>Braddock's corner
is yelling at Braddock</i>

02:09:03.993 --> 02:09:05.255
<i>to stay away from Baer.</i>

02:09:05.328 --> 02:09:07.125
<i>Because Baer is looking
for the knockout.</i>

02:09:07.196 --> 02:09:09.096
Stay off him, Jim. Come on!

02:09:11.901 --> 02:09:13.732
Right hand, Max. Yes!

02:09:21.544 --> 02:09:23.011
What is he, stupid?

02:09:26.248 --> 02:09:28.148
Step away!

02:09:28.317 --> 02:09:30.877
<i>Braddock trying to survive
this brutal onslaught!</i>

02:09:30.953 --> 02:09:32.648
Stay off him!

02:09:33.556 --> 02:09:35.490
Don't let him touch you!

02:09:35.558 --> 02:09:37.583
Hey, looking good, Maxie!

02:09:42.164 --> 02:09:44.928
Watch the uppercut! Just
stay the hell away from him!

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.628
<i>Baer cutting loose
with thunderous shots.</i>

02:09:47.703 --> 02:09:48.931

<i>Baer again with a right!</i>

<i>Baer looking for the knockout.</i>

02:09:55.678 --> 02:09:58.374
<i>He doesn't want this one
to go to the cards, folks.</i>

02:09:58.447 --> 02:10:00.711
<i>They pound each other
with lefts and rights.</i>

02:10:00.783 --> 02:10:02.876
<i>Braddock blocking
with his gloves and elbows.</i>

02:10:02.952 --> 02:10:05.546
<i>Snaps a big right

<i>Baer smashes him
with a big right!</i>

02:10:25.508 --> 02:10:27.738
<i>Braddock is back on the ropes.</i>

02:11:14.190 --> 02:11:16.522
<i>Braddock lands
a crushing right.</i>

Jesus Christ.

02:11:32.174 --> 02:11:33.505
Stay with him!

02:11:38.314 --> 02:11:40.282
<i>Both fighters are tired.</i>

02:11:50.059 --> 02:11:52.459
<i>Baer is trying wildly
for the knockout!</i>

02:11:52.761 --> 02:11:54.194
<i>But Jimmy is still standing</i>

<i>and he's not only standing,
he's moving forward.</i>

02:12:09.411 --> 02:12:12.676
<i>This is the finish.
Both boys are tired.</i>

02:12:12.915 --> 02:12:16.373
<i>This is not boxing, folks.
This is a walloping ballet.</i>

02:12:21.056 --> 02:12:22.353
Ten seconds!

02:12:22.424 --> 02:12:24.415

Son of a bitch.

02:13:30.426 --> 02:13:31.893
Hey, McAvoy!

02:13:33.662 --> 02:13:35.596
What?
Help me out here. Help me out.

02:13:35.664 --> 02:13:38.497
How did you score the fight?
Nine-five, one even.

02:13:39.068 --> 02:13:40.035
Which way?

02:13:40.102 --> 02:13:41.899
You'll have to read it
in the papers, Sporty.

02:13:41.971 --> 02:13:43.165
Oh, come on!

02:13:46.141 --> 02:13:48.006
What the hell is this crap?

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.840
I'll tell you this much, they take
this long to make a decision

02:13:53.916 --> 02:13:56.248
they're gonna decide
to screw somebody.

02:13:57.186 --> 02:13:58.585
Make a decision.

02:13:58.721 --> 02:14:00.746
They're gonna rob
this poor bastard.

02:14:00.823 --> 02:14:02.984
Unbelievable bullshit.
You win it.

02:14:09.531 --> 02:14:13.297
