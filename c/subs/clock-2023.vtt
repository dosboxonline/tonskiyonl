19:29.586 --> 19:30.796
so that you know what to expect.

19:32.005 --> 19:36.218
First off, my background is
in obstetrics and gynecology

19:36.218 --> 19:38.470
with an emphasis on the cognitive side

19:38.470 --> 19:40.138
of fertility issues.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.641
I have seen too many women
like you over the years

19:42.641 --> 19:45.227
just pulling their hair out, miserable,

19:45.227 --> 19:47.980
because they don't want to have children.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.731
But after hearing their stories

19:49.731 --> 19:51.149
and knowing their medical history,

19:51.149 --> 19:53.861
I have become 100 percent convinced

19:54.236 --> 19:57.823
that this is
a fixable physiological issue.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.909
The idea is simple.

20:01.869 --> 20:06.707
It is the singular evolutionary goal
of a species to procreate.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.668
That is our purpose, right?

20:10.836 --> 20:12.838
- Right.
- Which says to me that

20:12.838 --> 20:15.549
because you are otherwise
physically healthy,

20:15.549 --> 20:19.636
your system is just a little off,
chemically, mentally.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.432
No different than someone
with depression. You follow?

20:24.516 --> 20:27.769
- Sure.
- So the whole goal of this trial

20:27.769 --> 20:31.106
is to get you back realigned
with your natural state.

20:31.607 --> 20:32.983
And what does that involve?

20:33.525 --> 20:35.152
A multi-pronged approach.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.070
We administer medication,

20:37.070 --> 20:39.573
a newly engineered synthetic hormone--

20:39.573 --> 20:42.284
- Synthetic?
- A regimen of pills.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.954
The same naturally occurring hormones
that already exist in your body,

20:45.954 --> 20:48.540
just formulated
to up your desire for kids.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.419
And we pair that course
of treatment with CBT,

20:52.419 --> 20:54.421
cognitive behavioral therapy.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.923
Sorry, how much
can you really accomplish

20:55.923 --> 20:57.299
with 10 days of therapy?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.385
So we use a very targeted approach.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.179
Intense, but effective.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.516
And look, this trial is just
