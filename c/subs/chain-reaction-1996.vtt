WEBVTT

01:25.835 --> 01:29.171
We're running out of time.

01:29.214 --> 01:34.051
We have polluted and peopled this planet
to the brink of extinction.

01:34.135 --> 01:38.347
We are destroying our world
at a suicidal pace.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.767
We need a pollution revolution.

01:41.851 --> 01:47.689
And it's not going to be easy
because the world is addicted to petroIeum.

01:48.358 --> 01:52.861
We have limited resources
and we go to war to protect them.

01:57.867 --> 02:03.705
We need a new technology,
and this technology can't be sold.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.085
It must be given away - to everyone.

02:09.419 --> 02:13.006
We are in sight of a dream.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.634
There is a solution.

02:15.718 --> 02:21.140
The answer is aIl around us.
It's right here.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.726
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.148
There is enough energy
in this glass of water

02:29.232 --> 02:32.568
to power the city of Chicago for weeks.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.320
It's the hydrogen we're after.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.537
This is what happens when we burn it.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.166
It's perfectIy cIean.

02:47.250 --> 02:51.712
And you can burn it when you want to,
in a car, in a turbine,

02:51.754 --> 02:56.842
or in your own basement power supply
next to your water heater.

02:56.926 --> 03:00.888
But what if we could release
this energy efficiently?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.682
We will transform the world.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.604
Maybe we start to put an end to war.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.732
Of course, we have to make it work first.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.456
(woman) Morning!

03:30.460 --> 03:33.962
- Hey, James, how are you doing?
- Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.048
It's never too cold.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.474
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?

03:45.558 --> 03:46.767
Yeah, right away.

03:55.443 --> 03:59.488
- Hello, Mr Shannon.
- Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?

04:02.533 --> 04:04.326
- Alistair.
- Did you have a good trip?

04:04.369 --> 04:07.287
Very good, thank you.
Hi, young feIla.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.581
- Can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.

04:09.666 --> 04:13.543
I turn on the laser here. We should
focus it in the centre of the bubbIe.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.837
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?

04:15.880 --> 04:18.214
I did. I just didn't understand all the figures.

04:18.298 --> 04:23.178
- (Lu) We need to control the bubble.
- The regulator still isn't working.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.014
Eddie, did you computer-model
your work last night?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.684
No, I was too busy building it.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.521
We sustained fusion for 4.6 miIliseconds.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.356
StabIe?

04:34.399 --> 04:37.693
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.528
Let me show you. Come, come.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.782
(Lu) The power input and output
is fine at this stage.

04:43.866 --> 04:48.912
The output drops to nothing
at stage three, so what happened?

04:49.789 --> 04:52.457
- Paul!
- Yeah, OK.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.542
I gotta go.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.554
Cross your fingers, everyone.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.390
Good luck.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.069
(Alistair) Mr Chen. Initiate laser.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.654
(Lu) Initiate laser.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.918
(woman) Hydrogen separation in progress.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.798
(Lu) Initiate hydrogen burn.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.936
(man) Two million kelvin and rising.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.941
Shut it down!
It's unstable. Shut it down.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.412
We learned something important today.
We found another way that didn't work.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.956
We need to keep our minds open
and try again.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.931
(metallic buzzing)

07:01.587 --> 07:03.713
(buzzing stops)

07:04.549 --> 07:06.091
(metallic buzzing)

07:19.814 --> 07:20.814
Alistair.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.233
- It's working.
- Is it stable?

07:23.317 --> 07:24.776
Yeah, it's stable.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.362
- CompIeteIy stable.
- My God!

07:28.072 --> 07:30.740
- We go tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, Alistair.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.040
LiIy, taIk to me.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.501
Temperature, gas flow,
acoustic drive steadied.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.422
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.216
My spectrometer shows
stabIe hydrogen production.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.845
We're getting more out than we put in.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.562
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.

08:30.176 --> 08:34.596
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!

08:35.972 --> 08:39.518
- You're going to be famous.
- Thanks for everything.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.020
- We want more money now!
- Thanks for your trust.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.440

- I'll get you home.

We'll take my bike.

Oh, yes, please!

10:40.973 --> 10:44.726
We've got a better chance

10:48.147 --> 10:50.023
Mr Chen, upload everything.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.400
I want it on the Internet tonight.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.277
We'll wake up a lot of people.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.447
Damn right. Really wake 'em up.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.639
(speaks Japanese)

11:26.769 --> 11:29.771
We don't have the computer model ready.
We have the frequency.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.982
We'll send it to you in one hour.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.361
- Yeah, yeah, in one hour.
- (bang)

11:36.445 --> 11:39.781
(Alistair speaks in Russian)

11:41.617 --> 11:43.743
Where are you going?

11:46.789 --> 11:47.831
Chen?

11:55.798 --> 11:58.967
- Here we are.
- This is Alistair's house.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.262
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.181
Mmm. This... way.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.309
Is this... is this what drunk is?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.145
You've never been drunk?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.313
I've never been this.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.986
LiIy's too serious.
She's no fun.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.447
I think you're fun.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.286
Good night, Lily.

12:30.666 --> 12:31.583
Wow!

12:50.895 --> 12:53.396
(bleeping)

12:54.732 --> 12:57.275
(alarm buzzes)

13:14.752 --> 13:20.590
Alistair!

13:22.718 --> 13:55.166
Chen!

14:37.793 --> 14:39.085
Get ready.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.340
(rapid bleeping)

16:12.680 --> 16:14.722
(phone rings)

16:15.724 --> 16:18.226
- Shannon.
- Paul? Alistair's dead.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.896
- Eddie?
- I found him on the lab floor.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.564
- He was murdered.
- What?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.711
(police radios)

16:47.673 --> 16:51.592
(man) Just what caused the expIosion
Iast night is stilI unclear.

16:51.635 --> 16:55.763
University officiaIs say
this mill site had been converted

16:55.806 --> 16:58.307
for the experimental production
of hydrogen fuel.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.644
They say that's not supposed
to be dangerous.

17:01.729 --> 17:06.065
One question Iaw enforcement officials
are trying to determine

17:06.108 --> 17:08.108
is whether foul pIay was invoIved.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.278
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.

17:10.319 --> 17:15.657
But an FBI agent has said, and it was
reported by a Bureau spokesperson,

17:15.742 --> 17:20.496
that no nuclear device went off.
There was no atomic explosion.

17:20.580 --> 17:24.041
As far as you know,
are alI your people accounted for?

17:24.126 --> 17:27.086
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?

17:27.128 --> 17:31.466
Alistair didn't come home last night.
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.384
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.555
I started CPR.
I checked for breath, there was no breath.

17:37.639 --> 17:42.268
I checked and there was no pulse.
I continued with the CPR.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.990
Have the locals move
the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.243
- You got it.
- Find me a friendIy Federal judge.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.956
I want wiretap orders, search warrants
on everyone that worked here.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.211
Inspector Ford, you've taken
charge of this investigation.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.921
Why is the FBI involved?

18:10.005 --> 18:14.967
Eight city bIocks disappeared.
The President talked to my boss at 3am.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.177
He wants answers.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.613
TelI me about Eddie.
Does he drink, do drugs?

18:35.697 --> 18:42.036
No. He's just a machinist,
an undergraduate working to get his degree.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.749
That's the undisclosed cost
of our cheap fossil fuel.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.960
Who'd be interested in this?

18:49.878 --> 18:53.673
Cheap, clean, abundant energy?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.134
Who wouldn't?

19:00.472 --> 19:04.350
- When you left the party, who was there?
- Eddie.

19:05.227 --> 19:09.355
So, Eddie, telI us again why you came back?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.236
I'd come back for my bike.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.114
You say you'd returned
from taking Miss Sinclair home.

19:18.198 --> 19:22.702
That's right. Her car wouIdn't start,
so I took her home on the bus.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.414
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?

19:26.456 --> 19:30.918
We work together.
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.962
I was...

19:34.923 --> 19:36.340
hired by Dr Chen.

19:36.425 --> 19:42.763
- And who is Dr Chen?
- He was Dr Barkley's project manager.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.642
- Why did he hire you?
- Because I'm a physicist.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.355
GentIemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.608
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.485
Nick, what did you find?

19:56.570 --> 20:00.281
It looks like he packed with a shoveI.
He was in a hurry.

20:00.365 --> 20:05.328
Dr Barkley expressed interest
in a specialist in sonoluminescence.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.914
He knew about Dr Chen.

20:07.956 --> 20:12.501
So through some friends in the State
Department, I got him here and onto the team.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.004
You have friends in the State Department?

20:17.382 --> 20:20.968
- We have influential members of the board.
- Really?

20:21.803 --> 20:24.305
- Who's on the board of your foundation?
- (phone)

20:25.265 --> 20:27.308
- Ford.
- Various scientists...

20:27.351 --> 20:29.810
- Yeah.
- ..and industrialists.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.021
Your Dr Chen is missing.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.315
Any idea where he might be?

20:36.485 --> 20:37.818
He may be dead.

20:37.903 --> 20:42.698
- We have no comment.
- Eddie Kasalivich! You said they killed him.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.117
Who killed him, Eddie?

20:45.160 --> 20:47.703
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?

20:49.039 --> 20:53.626
- What are you looking for?
- We're examining the articles on his desk.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.796
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!

20:56.838 --> 21:00.841
They have a search warrant,
but no respect for a man's life.

21:00.884 --> 21:06.013
I want a full inventory. These are
very important, sensitive scientific papers.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.516
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!

21:09.559 --> 21:12.603
For two decades, Doctor Barkley...

21:12.688 --> 21:16.315
(Shannon) I have to speak
to the university's IegaI counseI.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.567
Please give LiIy any help you can.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.736
I can't stay here tonight.

21:23.365 --> 21:27.702
(TV) Among the missing is Dr Lu Chen,
who the authorities are looking for.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.371
He may be considered a suspect...

21:30.414 --> 21:34.625
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.094
Oh, no.

21:45.178 --> 21:50.224
- What is it?
- It's from Dr Lu Chen.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.394
He wants me
to bring the rest of the information,

21:53.478 --> 21:57.898
alI the data and meet him
at the rendezvous in Shanghai.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.199
I'm being framed.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.994
What are you talking about?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.663
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.915
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.835
I don't know who sent it.

22:19.588 --> 22:23.674
- Where's Chen?
- You don't think he did it?

22:30.974 --> 22:32.850
Let's...

22:33.518 --> 22:35.269
Let's get outta here, OK?

22:54.623 --> 22:56.665
- Can I help you?
- I sure hope so.

22:56.750 --> 23:01.420
- We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.
- He's on the phone right now.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.925
- Excuse me.
- You can't go in there!!

23:05.967 --> 23:10.805
- (speakerphone) There's a lot to explain.
- I'll call you back.

23:13.308 --> 23:17.645
- What now, Agent Ford?
- We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.

23:17.729 --> 23:21.816
He left coIlege for discipIinary reasons.
He bIew the heIl out of the Iab.

23:21.858 --> 23:25.611
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?

23:27.114 --> 23:29.573
- He resigned.
- Under some pressure?

23:29.658 --> 23:30.991
There was some pressure.

23:31.034 --> 23:34.662
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.665
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.377
Didn't you think
this information was important?

23:41.461 --> 23:43.212
I don't see the relevance.

23:43.296 --> 23:48.217
- You don't see a smalI connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.

23:48.301 --> 23:52.012
The CIA telIs me
Chen might be involved in espionage.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.973
KasaIivich's past makes me nervous.

23:54.015 --> 23:59.645
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes
inviting her to mainland China.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.318
RealIy?

24:07.988 --> 24:10.156
RealIy.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.883
What's wrong?

24:32.554 --> 24:34.680
That's my place.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.518
(Eddie) Let's get outta here.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.231
(siren)

24:47.944 --> 24:50.821
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.656
Not much, he's a student machinist.

24:52.741 --> 24:56.410
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!

24:56.453 --> 24:59.038
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.333
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.257
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.636
Jesus, you could put together
almost anything here.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.554
I want all this.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.807
All right! We need a total lab workup.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.268
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.855
Yeah, don't touch it.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.656
Hey, Nick! What's this?

25:33.740 --> 25:36.367
It's a transmitter.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.745
- It's a burst transmitter.
- What does it do?

25:39.788 --> 25:43.332
It sends massive amounts
of information by satellite,

25:43.416 --> 25:45.417
probabIy to China.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.844
Nick! Doyle!

25:58.306 --> 26:00.683
(radio) Calls flooded into
the University Of Chicago

26:00.767 --> 26:04.270
from all over the world,
enquiring about the professor.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.606
Concern came from
the Royal Academy in London,

26:07.649 --> 26:10.859
from Paris, Moscow
and all parts of the compass.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.154
But at the same time,
critics say Barkley was a Utopian dreamer.

26:14.197 --> 26:17.157
They point out that the research
he was involved with

26:17.200 --> 26:21.829
was far more dangerous
than he realised.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.429
(man) Paul.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.349
Shannon!

26:44.394 --> 26:46.812
What's going on?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.607
- Tell me about the money, Eddie.
- What money?

26:49.691 --> 26:53.110
The $250,000 the FBI found in your Ioft.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.617
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about the transmitter? Think hard.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.829
Jesus...

27:04.539 --> 27:07.833
I suppose you're not in communication
with Dr Chen in China?

27:07.876 --> 27:09.126
It wasn't Chen.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.503
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.255
I've got a good one.

27:13.340 --> 27:17.468
He'lI negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'Il calI him.

27:17.552 --> 27:20.179
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.264
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

27:22.349 --> 27:25.309
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.

27:25.393 --> 27:28.437
We're being set up. I'm not going
to the cops untiI I know more.

27:28.521 --> 27:32.858
Run, and you'lI have
every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.654
Look, talk to this lawyer.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.990
We'll go somewhere safe
and wait until you work it out.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.660
- Where?
- Maggie's.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.453
We'll go to Maggie's.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.165
OK. Have you got any money?

27:48.875 --> 27:52.503
- $40.
- All right. Here.

27:52.587 --> 27:56.298
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.092
(tyres screech)

28:01.221 --> 28:04.098
Why is this happening, Paul?

28:04.140 --> 28:07.810
It's gonna be alI right, Eddie.
I promise you.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.438
Wait here five minutes, then leave.

28:16.736 --> 28:20.989
- What do we know about this Shannon?
- Illinois Institute of Technology,

28:21.074 --> 28:25.160
Kennedy School of Government.
Worked for several aerospace giants.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.122
Three years in Washington
under Reagan...

28:28.206 --> 28:30.791
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.086
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.296
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?

28:36.339 --> 28:39.591
He's not just someone that runs a foundation.

28:46.808 --> 28:50.644
There's a train at 8.40
at the Union Station to WiIliams Bay.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.522
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?

28:53.606 --> 28:55.232
We lived and worked together.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.693
(TV) This is the Channel 32 special report.

28:57.777 --> 29:02.489
We go live to the Federal Office Building
in Chicago.

29:02.532 --> 29:07.828
As you know, it's been
a very long and a very trying day for us all.

29:07.912 --> 29:13.834
Material witness warrants have been issued
in IIlinois for Professor Lu Chen,

29:14.836 --> 29:18.589
Dr Lily Sinclair, and Edward Kasalivich.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.719
- Oh, my God!
- If anyone knows their whereabouts,

29:23.803 --> 29:26.263
please contact the Chicago FBI office.

29:26.347 --> 29:30.559
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.

29:33.313 --> 29:38.692
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.
Williams Bay. I'Il meet you on the track.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.574
- Be safe.
- You too.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.125
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?

30:02.675 --> 30:04.760
Union Station, pIease.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.437
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.733
Hey! Officer!

30:22.695 --> 30:24.696
Hey, buddy!

30:26.282 --> 30:27.574
Hey, you!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.931
I got him! I got him!

30:54.269 --> 31:00.107
It makes no sense. If Kasalivich is just
a pawn, why has he got a burst transmitter?

31:00.191 --> 31:03.569
- What?
- He's gotta be transmitting to someone.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.903
- Unbelievable.
- What?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.739
CPD's chasing Kasalivich
down Michigan Avenue.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.552
Stay where you are!

32:05.673 --> 32:08.634
He's gonna falI! Get me a boat under there!

32:12.555 --> 32:14.806
What the hell's he doing?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.274
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?

32:38.998 --> 32:42.709
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.

32:48.299 --> 32:53.762
- Listen. How do we get him down?
- Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna falI.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.897
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.316
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.777
Ten-four. Bring it down sIow.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.138
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!

34:07.378 --> 34:10.047
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?

34:17.472 --> 34:21.349
- Right, I want this cleared.
- Let's go! Do a search!

34:50.755 --> 34:52.630
Move it, move it!

34:52.672 --> 34:54.674
Go! Go! Right now!

34:54.759 --> 34:57.260
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!

35:05.186 --> 35:07.020
So where the helI is he?

35:07.772 --> 35:11.024
(announcement)
Amtrak northbound, No. 343,

35:11.067 --> 35:17.781
now leaving on track 19
for Fox Lake, Wallburgh, Williams Bay,

35:17.865 --> 35:19.950
Jamesfield and Madison.

35:21.244 --> 35:25.247
- God! I didn't think I was gonna make it.
- Watch your step.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.877
Don't worry, he'll be here.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.727
You were right.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.111
- What took you so long?
- The bridge was up.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.905
All aboard!

36:20.469 --> 36:23.763
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.688
Thank you.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.944
Are you sure
she's going to be up this late?

36:37.987 --> 36:41.072
Yeah, she's usually up all night.

36:41.115 --> 36:44.117
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.912
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!

37:02.303 --> 37:04.387
(whirring)

37:11.812 --> 37:13.480
(Eddie) Maggie.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.317
Maggie!

37:17.360 --> 37:18.568
Oh, my.

37:21.447 --> 37:25.116
- Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!
- I didn't do it.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.331
Oh, it's good to see you, man.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.002
- You must be the other terrorist.
- I guess I am.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.088
Maggie, this is LiIy.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.258
Hi, LiIy.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.353
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.

38:05.324 --> 38:09.286
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.912
I know a guy that knows a guy.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.206
- Who?
- It's a guy.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.836
- Who's the guy?
- Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.

38:17.878 --> 38:23.091
Security concerns must be given
greater importance in industrial research.

38:23.175 --> 38:26.803
We don't know the cause of the explosion.

38:26.887 --> 38:33.143
And we don't know the source of
the espionage, if indeed there was espionage.

38:33.894 --> 38:37.897
But we do know that we are at risk.

38:37.940 --> 38:43.862
Every idea that offers a competitive
advantage to Americans is subject to theft.

38:43.904 --> 38:47.490
And that, gentlemen, couId be catastrophic.

38:47.575 --> 38:52.746
Mr Shannon, over the past ten years,
this committee has approved

38:52.830 --> 38:58.543
hundreds of millions of dollars
for your research projects

38:58.586 --> 39:06.343
without having one good, goddamn idea
about where the heIl aIl the money was going.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.095
He's talking about our tax dolIars up there.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.431
We were under the impression, Senator,

39:11.474 --> 39:16.978
that you passed Iegislation
to ensure that you wouIdn't know.

39:17.063 --> 39:21.941
Or perhaps, more accurately,
that you didn't want to know.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.945
I'm aware of the Iaw, Mr Shannon,
thank you. I wrote it.

39:26.530 --> 39:30.200
But I don't remember,
when I drafted it, that I anticipated

39:30.284 --> 39:35.205
a large portion
of the south side of Chicago bIown up.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.125
What assurances can you give me
and this committee

39:39.168 --> 39:42.003
that this event wiIl never happen again?

39:45.091 --> 39:48.009
None, Senator.

39:48.094 --> 39:51.262
The incident in Chicago was tragic,
to be sure.

39:51.305 --> 39:57.060
But sometimes that is the price we must pay
to ensure our competitive edge in the future.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.647
We didn't intend to pay for
our space exploration programme

40:00.731 --> 40:04.401
with the Iives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.

40:04.485 --> 40:08.071
NevertheIess,
we must not waver in our commitment

40:08.155 --> 40:12.242
to technological and scientific
research and development.

40:13.202 --> 40:18.456
As you gentlemen know,
there are many threats to our way of life.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.502
And not all of them wear uniforms
and carry guns.

40:23.337 --> 40:27.924
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for
your appearance today before this committee.

40:28.008 --> 40:33.054
You have spoken like a true patriot
of whom this country can be very proud.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.641
Thank you, sir.

40:41.188 --> 40:43.189
(typing on computer)

40:47.153 --> 40:50.238
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?

40:50.322 --> 40:53.700
He never got over
not getting his credentials.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.369
No-one on the team couId have done this.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.789
Whoever is doing this
knows an awful lot about us.

41:00.749 --> 41:06.337
If I hadn't have shown up,
they wouId have thought it was an accident.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.216
And nobody would know
what's realIy going on.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.801
(beep)

41:11.886 --> 41:13.887
Oh, my God.

41:46.962 --> 41:50.089
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?

41:50.132 --> 41:52.592
SurveiIlance is up on Shannon's estate.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.844
Cue it up, Jimmy.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.267
Where are the files
on the Moore Foundation?

42:28.045 --> 42:30.421
GentIemen, Shannon's moving.

43:20.681 --> 43:24.017
(loudspeaker)
There will be an orientation meeting

43:24.101 --> 43:30.148
in the main auditorium,
on level one, at 1400 hours.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.692
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.320
- Is it running?
- Not yet.

43:49.251 --> 43:54.797
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- FBI. I'm Agent WilIiams, this is Agent Lim.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.966
So, what kind of facility is this?

43:57.051 --> 43:59.927
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not aIlowed to discuss this.

44:10.022 --> 44:15.193
Good morning, Iadies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.029
Thank you.

44:18.572 --> 44:21.741
I don't care if he's got
an appointment with Mother Teresa.

44:21.825 --> 44:26.079
We have been waiting for him
for 35 minutes.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.164
You're late.

44:29.291 --> 44:33.461
- This is another one of your messes, Lyman.
- It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.

44:33.545 --> 44:37.382
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!

44:37.424 --> 44:40.218
This thing's stilI not working.

44:40.260 --> 44:44.889
You've got to call off the Bureau.
Do you understand?

44:44.932 --> 44:46.641
I'm not sure I can do that.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.769
There's an awfuI Iot of expIaining to do.

44:51.772 --> 44:54.315
Where's the young man?

44:55.109 --> 44:57.110
KasaIivich?

44:59.780 --> 45:03.700
He's someplace safe.
I'm bringing him in today.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.580
Paul!

45:12.543 --> 45:16.963
If someone's going down for this,
it is not gonna be I.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.805
Paul Shannon, please.

45:25.889 --> 45:29.392
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.

45:29.476 --> 45:31.561
Washington.

45:32.229 --> 45:34.814
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.

45:34.898 --> 45:36.190
Punch it up.

45:41.029 --> 45:45.032
Maggie McDermott. She was
put through from the Chicago office.

45:48.036 --> 45:49.996
Maggie?

45:50.998 --> 45:53.332
Shannon, it's Eddie.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.251
(feedback)

45:55.335 --> 45:58.755
- It's scrambled.
- It's him, on a payphone in WilIiams Bay.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.673
I'll get the locals.

46:00.716 --> 46:04.969
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That phony fax...

46:05.012 --> 46:09.140
I know about that. Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.894
LiIy tracked it to Beijing.
It routed through a Chinese company,

46:12.978 --> 46:17.148
but it came from
the US Technological Business CounciI.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.941
- We've gotta go.
- Heard of it?

46:19.026 --> 46:22.403
- They'll be there in an hour.
- Now, Eddie!

46:24.364 --> 46:26.908
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.

46:27.701 --> 46:28.868
Eddie. Eddie!

46:28.911 --> 46:30.495
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

46:30.537 --> 46:32.663
(siren)

46:37.002 --> 46:40.254
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!

46:40.339 --> 46:43.049
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.

46:43.133 --> 46:44.884
RealIy, Maggie?

46:50.974 --> 46:54.268
You should have brought him in
when you had the chance.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.993
Get a unit to the observatory, right away!

47:30.013 --> 47:32.557
- Lily! Lily!
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.

47:32.599 --> 47:34.267
- We've gotta go!
- Listen.

47:34.309 --> 47:38.813
This counciI Iobbies for defence contractors...
The list goes on and on.

47:38.897 --> 47:42.984
We've gotta go now.
The cops are here. Come on!

47:43.068 --> 47:45.570
How did they find us?

47:45.612 --> 47:48.030
Hey! Hold it right there.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.157
Hey!

47:50.242 --> 47:52.034
Hold it! Hey!

47:52.494 --> 47:53.744
Stop!

48:03.922 --> 48:05.464
Hold it!

48:05.966 --> 48:08.718
Stop! HoId it right there.

48:08.802 --> 48:10.052
Get your hands up.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.597
Get 'em up!

48:15.559 --> 48:19.645
Walk back slowly towards me.
Come on, do it!

48:20.939 --> 48:22.481
Keep coming.

48:25.652 --> 48:27.236
Good, hold it right there.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.363
(helicopter)

48:33.493 --> 48:36.829
This is Nemitz, on the roof of the observatory.
I've got 'em.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.624
Aagh!

48:42.544 --> 48:44.295
(sirens)

48:48.133 --> 48:50.301
Go! Go, go, go, go!

49:01.355 --> 49:02.855
Come on!

49:10.530 --> 49:14.492
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.452
Suspect is armed!

49:34.262 --> 49:35.513
Get in the boat!

49:37.557 --> 49:41.143
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!

49:58.036 --> 49:59.662
Eddie, what are you doing?

49:59.746 --> 50:02.164
The best I can.

50:02.249 --> 50:06.669
Get the boat!
He's on the ice!

50:15.137 --> 50:17.638
- Are you OK?
- Yes!

50:52.966 --> 50:55.301
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.274
LiIy, the bag! Give me the bag.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.152
Go, go!

51:39.971 --> 51:41.430
There's nobody in there!

51:45.852 --> 51:48.938
(TV) We need a pollution revolution.

51:49.022 --> 51:53.150
I don't care.
Search aIl of Wisconsin if you have to.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.902
They Iost him?

51:55.028 --> 51:58.030
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.

51:58.115 --> 52:03.202
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.371
Maybe you weren't realIy there.

52:05.413 --> 52:07.581
Maybe we're not realIy here.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.468
(Lily gasps)

52:33.316 --> 52:36.819
Eddie, I can't... feel my Iegs.

52:36.903 --> 52:46.620
Come on.

53:25.952 --> 53:28.454
We've got fire, we've got fire.

53:50.143 --> 53:54.021
Why would a policeman
shoot another policeman?

53:55.482 --> 53:57.983
Maybe they weren't police.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.782
Why didn't they shoot at us?

54:06.326 --> 54:08.327
I don't know.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.463
What a dump, huh?

54:20.340 --> 54:22.049
- But I can't do...
- Mr Shannon.

54:22.133 --> 54:24.593
There's two gentlemen
from the FBI here to see you.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.721
This is more important
than his afternoon tea.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.896
Our apoIogies for interrupting
your tea, Mr Shannon.

54:35.981 --> 54:40.192
- But what's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.278
We understand he phoned you.

54:43.238 --> 54:46.448
I counselled Eddie
to turn himself in to the authorities.

54:46.533 --> 54:50.202
He and Miss SincIair
shot a Wisconsin state trooper.

54:51.037 --> 54:56.542
- I doubt that very seriously.
- Well, the state trooper's very dead.

54:58.378 --> 55:03.924
Mr Shannon, these are copies
of the Moore Foundation IRS fiIes.

55:04.009 --> 55:06.093
Do you know what's in them?

55:08.305 --> 55:13.809
Meagre tax records, I imagine.
We are a non-profit organisation.

55:13.893 --> 55:18.397
The funding for your foundation
comes from a wide variety of sources.

55:18.440 --> 55:22.276
Defence contractors,
teIecommunication companies, aerospace.

55:22.360 --> 55:25.362
It's gratifying to know
our work is appreciated.

55:25.405 --> 55:29.366
The bulk of funding seems to come
from one Cayman Islands account.

55:29.409 --> 55:34.204
- I don't do the fundraising.
- Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.834
- Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?
- The foundation pays my salary.

55:38.918 --> 55:42.212
CIassified accounts,
encrypted phone caIls...

55:42.255 --> 55:48.927
A man could be forgiven for thinking
that your foundation is a front for the CIA.

55:48.970 --> 55:53.349
In that case, there may be national security
issues here that are Iarger than alI of us.

55:53.433 --> 55:56.769
Obstructing an FBI investigation
is a federaI crime.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.605
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.

55:59.689 --> 56:04.943
National security does not incIude
murdering peopIe. Domestically, at least.

56:05.612 --> 56:09.907
TelI your friends at LangIey
that domestic is our back yard.

56:09.949 --> 56:12.451
They're not aIlowed to play here.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.038
You can keep the returns.

56:18.291 --> 56:20.292
Nice house.

56:27.467 --> 56:31.387
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...

56:32.305 --> 56:33.889
or sardines.

56:33.973 --> 56:36.683
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.

56:36.768 --> 56:39.311
Sardines. BeautifuI choice.

56:45.110 --> 56:48.862
So, is this how you seduce aIl the girIs?

56:48.947 --> 56:54.118
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.

56:55.745 --> 56:57.413
Thank you.

56:59.916 --> 57:02.668
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.

57:02.710 --> 57:04.711
I won't be long, OK?

57:22.105 --> 57:25.607
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.109
Well, now.

57:27.152 --> 57:30.988
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?

57:32.240 --> 57:37.411
First, he was a suspect.
Worst-case scenario, they arrest him.

57:37.495 --> 57:42.541
Now he's a cop-killer.
Worst-case scenario, they kill him.

57:42.625 --> 57:45.878
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first pIace?

57:45.962 --> 57:47.629
Two words.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.382
Convenience and expedience.

57:51.342 --> 57:53.552
He saw too much, he was talking.

57:53.595 --> 57:55.888
The poor boy was
in the wrong pIace at the wrong time.

57:55.972 --> 57:58.265
I need this poor boy!

57:58.349 --> 58:01.768
This poor boy is the onIy one
who knows the frequencies!

58:04.772 --> 58:08.150
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?

58:08.234 --> 58:10.527
Poor impulse control?

58:12.530 --> 58:16.533
BarkIey, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!

58:16.576 --> 58:18.619
That was alI of it!

58:19.245 --> 58:22.623
I am sick to death
of cIeaning up your messes.

58:22.707 --> 58:26.084
No, Paul, no. Yours. Not mine.

58:27.462 --> 58:29.588
You lost it, Paul.

58:29.631 --> 58:31.882
Lost control, perspective.

58:31.925 --> 58:34.801
You made it personal with these peopIe.

58:34.886 --> 58:38.639
Well, we'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,

58:39.307 --> 58:42.351
then, my friend, then,

58:42.936 --> 58:45.938
this young man will be a liability.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.400
That'Il be my problem.

58:50.902 --> 58:53.654
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.

58:54.197 --> 58:56.198
When the time comes,

58:57.784 --> 58:59.326
I'll handle it.

59:00.620 --> 59:02.704
You'd better.

59:16.135 --> 59:18.762
(footsteps)

59:47.333 --> 59:51.920
- So what does he want us to do?
- We find him and give him an injection.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.756
(cocks pistol)

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.555
(creaking)

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:02.282
LiIy.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.534
LiIy!

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.269
(drops tray)

01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:38.735
Come on.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:56.503
Leesburg, Virginia.
C-Systems.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:01.675
- Who are they?
- Not cops.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.593
Cops carry badges,

01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:06.722
credit cards,
pictures of their families.

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:27.242
(Eddie) If it's crowded, don't go in.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.577
OK.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.139
Hi. Can I heIp you?

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:53.602
I'd like to send some fIowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.525
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.069
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.822
May I see that?

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.866
Thank you.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.874
Hold it right there, buddy. FBI.

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:19.544
Step outside the van, please.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.090
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.013
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.642
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:36.186
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.229
Have a nice day.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:41.608
So, officialIy this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:44.444
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.656
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.783
I think this is Kasalivich.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:56.456
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.251
- What is this, a wrestling match?
- Bad movie, video game?

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.419
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.

01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:05.632
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:08.426
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:10.345
Very well may be.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.313
HeIlo, Eddie.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.065
- Glad you got the flowers.
- Very clever.

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:08.236
- Are you all right?
- No, not really.

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.989
I guess I can understand that.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:15.243
We were at Maggie's. Caught.
We were about to be arrested.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:20.749
Somebody shot the cop.
Later, two guys tried to kilI us.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:24.586
I've got my car outside. FoIlow me.
We'll go somepIace we can taIk.

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:28.089
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:31.593
They weren't cops.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.054
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:41.394
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.
We're being watched.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.904
Eddie, the world isn't as simpIe
as we'd like it to be.

01:05:50.988 --> 01:05:52.906
It just doesn't work that way.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:58.662
- Shannon, who are you?
- I'm your friend, Eddie.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:02.374
- I may be your onIy friend.
- Is it you, Paul?

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:06.378
Are you responsible for all this?

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:11.591
Time to go, Eddie.
You've got a job to compIete.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.971
The experiment needs verifying.

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:18.181
Do your work... This will all be over.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.813
Eddie, we're beyond that now.
Let's just get this done.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:27.190
Come back to work with me.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.275
You'll have your life back, I promise you.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.361
You don't control our lives.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:35.782
- You'll have to trust me, Eddie.
- Just like Alistair?

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:54.009
Eddie!

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:12.110
(loudspeaker) A trip that
normally takes over five hours.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:17.532
But today, you'll experience the events
of that flight in just seven minutes,

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:19.617
from takeoff to landing.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.914
The crew is preparing for takeoff.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.876
Your pilot for today's flight
is Captain Dave Larsen.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:33.798
Stay here.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:36.468
Our co-pilot is First Officer...

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:41.681
Get in.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.145
She's in the hatch.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:48.980
Look out!

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:57.030
The crew are going through
their final pre-flight checks...

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:00.283
Eddie!

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:05.413
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything fooIish.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.481
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum,

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.817
by the NeanderthaI man exhibit.

01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:18.694
(Eddie) CQ 493... CQ 493.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.031
(siren)

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.336
Here you are, darling. Drink this.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.798
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:42.719
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd Iike you to meet.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.805
Dr HolIoway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:52.895
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:55.273
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:57.066
(Lily) Lu.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.835
(Shannon) Lily.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:21.174
We would like you and Dr Chen to continue
the work you were doing with Dr BarkIey.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.347
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:31.184
We've been impressed with your work
for a Iong time.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:36.814
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.359
No.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.111
Dr Barkley, we left behind.

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:49.744
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:07.053
(man) You end up sIeeping on the street.
I can't believe you'd do that.

01:11:07.137 --> 01:11:09.555
Don't even say that kind of stuff.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.269
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:15.436
Can't you see me?

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:29.575
Can I share your grate?

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.623
(woman) You make me sick!

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:39.377
(siren)

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:46.217
(woman) We can't go in! We got kicked out!

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:51.306
(woman) What are all youse looking at?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:55.727
Let go!

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.573
(taps keys)

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.578
(Eddie) CQ 493.

01:12:29.386 --> 01:12:34.932
(TV) This is Eddie. I think. He does.
But he really does.

01:12:34.975 --> 01:12:37.060
What are you watching?
Honeymooner reruns?

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:39.562
KasaIivich and Barkley. Look at this.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.608
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the pIace up?

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.611
The whoIe thing stinks.
Thanks.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:50.156
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.826
TefIon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.288
I don't buy it.
He's smart enough to blow up the lab,

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:01.626
but stupid enough to leave $250,000
where we'd be sure to find it?

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.380
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.176
$100. The kid didn't do it.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.304
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.141
Make sure nobody shoots him.

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.369
(phone rings)

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:39.515
Next shift's going down now, OK?

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.129
Yeah, right.
HeIp me out on this, will ya?

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.549
I've got problems with the conveyor belt.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.386
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.

01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:20.431
(workman) OK? All right.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:24.060
If you've got any probIems,
give me a caIl on channeI four.

01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:45.498
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:50.962
We'll soon find out, won't we?
The young lady appears to be cooperating.

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:52.004
Good.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:55.424
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.

01:15:55.467 --> 01:15:59.804
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,
please, have a seat.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.738
(loudspeaker) Attention, all personnel.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:24.662
Critical path experiment
will commence in ten minutes.

01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:26.914
Level five.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.794
(voices)

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.678
Activate the H2 compressor.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.388
On automatic.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.473
Here we go.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:50.730
- Lucasz, what are you reading?
- Two miIlion keIvin.

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:52.815
Activate the laser.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.114
(Lucasz) Four million kelvin.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.956
(bleeping)

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:14.545
You don't have it. It's unstable.

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:17.006
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.387
Dammit! What a joke.

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:28.184
- It won't work without the right frequencies.
- (speaks Chinese)

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.518
What did he say?

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:32.980
He said that's what
he's been trying to teIl you for days.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.983
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:40.905
- See you back here at 8:15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:44.867
- the solution will present itself.
- I doubt it.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:49.455
It had better,
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.124
Take them back to their room.

01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:58.923
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kilI my scientists to their faces.

01:17:58.965 --> 01:18:00.257
It might make my job easier.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.886
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:07.598
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:09.767
(clunking)

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.623
- It's working?
- Yes.

01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:58.876
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:03.047
- Lucasz?
- That's his story.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:23.400
You should have seen it when I got here -
the output was going right through the roof!

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.070
Son of a bitch.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:29.949
It reaIly does work. Ha!

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:33.452
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:34.954
We've got it.

01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:42.586
What did you do?

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:44.630
Nothing.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:48.092
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:52.263
I heard this voice saying,
"Go down and check different frequencies",

01:20:52.305 --> 01:20:54.640
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:59.687
So I went down to the Iab
and ran the experiment and it all worked out.

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:02.690
So, here we are, sir.

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:09.947
- Did you document the frequencies?
- Not yet.

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:12.867
I'd like those on a disk. Now, sir.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:18.205
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.794
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

01:21:24.796 --> 01:21:29.049
- Where are you going, Paul?
- To check this against the Chicago data.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.390
I'll try to meet you at the silo.

01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:39.268
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:56.244 --> 01:22:00.205
HeIlo, Eddie.
I figured it was you.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.917
Nice pIace you have here, Shannon.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:07.338
Ten-megajoule lasers.
ParticIe reactors.

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.466
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff down here years ago.

01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:15.012
- They made a mistake.
- Is this part of the Moore Foundation?

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.056
In a manner of speaking.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:21.018
Power and money.
Is that what this was aIl about?

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:25.648
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:29.860
He was a 60-year-oId scientist
who did nothing but good,

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.737
and they put a bag over his head.

01:22:32.697 --> 01:22:35.532
It was a mistake.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.869
Last thing I wanted
was for something to happen to Alistair.

01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:44.333
But a decision had to be made. So...

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.293
Who made the decision?

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:50.130
- You?
- That's my job.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:55.052
That's what I'm paid to do.
I'm paid to do dirty work.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:57.888
The work peopIe don't want to know about.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.224
PeopIe want to live in split-level homes,

01:23:00.266 --> 01:23:03.102
and eat microwave dinners
and watch coIour TV.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.980
Is that what you think?

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:11.235
Alistair was a dreamer.

01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.904
CIean air, free energy.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:18.993
Noble concepts, but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:22.705
Now, what happens if you dump
free energy onto the worId market?

01:23:23.289 --> 01:23:28.460
Stock markets would plummet.
Our own economy would collapse overnight.

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:32.423
Recession, unemployment, war.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:35.134
The worId is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.

01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:40.597
- We can barely hold on as it is.
- You're right, it's not working.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.058
That's why
we've got to try something else.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.394
Not bury the technology, but let it out.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:49.982
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.

01:23:50.066 --> 01:23:51.775
It can absorb it now.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:58.032
- There's our boy.
- Mr Kasalivich!

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:00.743
How kind of you to join us.

01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:03.287
Give us a moment, Lyman.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:07.332
- Eddie and I are having a conversation.
- Please! Don't let me stop you!

01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:12.296
Who runs this place, Shannon?
You or the guy with the guns?

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:17.885
Well, we are a cooperative of sorts.

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:21.388
Run at the behest
of the United States government.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:26.894
- But without their knowledge, right?
- My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:30.105
All right, Eddie.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:32.274
What do you want?

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.821
There are the specs for the regulator.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:41.492
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer. Now let us go.

01:24:41.534 --> 01:24:45.537
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:47.790
That was the deal, wasn't it?

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:54.004
Yeah. Yeah, that was the deal.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:58.550
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiabIe.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.346
I see.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:13.023
I want to tell you this story how I got inspired.
I had this dream...

01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:15.859
Hold on.
I will continue.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.029
(feedback)

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.201
What's happening?

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:38.841
- What did you just do?
- I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.

01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:43.220
Oh, and I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:55.899
Check the breakers.
Everybody, back to your stations!

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:06.743
- What the hell's going on?
- It just started, hundreds of pages.

01:26:06.786 --> 01:26:10.747
Technical drawings,
specs for experiments, budgets,

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:14.835
personneI records, minutes,
mostIy marked top secret.

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:17.254
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:20.674
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.

01:26:20.758 --> 01:26:26.096
- Here's a special love note just for you.
- Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:30.767
He says he's in a bunker in Leesburg
and wants us to come and arrest him.

01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:34.229
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:39.526
It sounds Iike you owe me $100.
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.613
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:45.157
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.951
What the hell's going on?

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:52.080
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.

01:26:56.502 --> 01:27:00.672
- Turn it off.
- It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:04.468
Al, how long before
we run out of storage capacity?

01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:07.763
- I don't know.
- Eddie, 20 minutes before it blows?

01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:10.057
- Maybe less.
- Is he right?

01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:12.142
I'm afraid he is.

01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:21.068
Well done, Eddie.
Well done.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:27.449
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.

01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:29.743
Sure I wouId.

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:34.748
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the heIl out of here.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:41.672
- (Eddie) No!
- Chen!

01:27:41.714 --> 01:27:43.507
- Lily!
- Chen!

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.509
For God's sake, Lyman!

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.344
Chen! Chen!

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:49.888
Wait!

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:52.266
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:55.727
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:59.189
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:01.733
I'm going to turn down the power.

01:28:01.818 --> 01:28:03.694
- No!
- Don't touch that!

01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:05.362
Don't!

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:09.199
(booming)

01:28:12.495 --> 01:28:15.122
(loudspeaker)
Hydrogen containment failure.

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:17.082
Potential personnel hazard.

01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:20.502
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:23.672
- You can't.
- The computers are down.

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:28.719
Get out!
Get out! Everybody!

01:28:30.346 --> 01:28:32.347
- Fix it.
- I can't now.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.641
- Fix it!
- I can't!

01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:40.230
- I wouldn't do that, Lyman.
- It will ignite the hydrogen.

01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:43.358
It's over, Lyman. It's over.

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:48.530
- I guess it's time to go.
- Go! Go!

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:51.616
Give me the disk.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:56.663
- You two, stay!
- No, Lyman! Let them go!

01:28:57.457 --> 01:29:00.042
What possible difference can it make now?

01:29:00.084 --> 01:29:03.337
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:06.673
- Never.
- Well, it's not your decision.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:09.676
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:13.930
You can stay with them, if you like.

01:29:13.973 --> 01:29:17.100
We must go now!

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.560
Well, are you coming?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:25.692
(loudspeaker) Warning. Warning.
Air contaminants at critical level.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:28.904
(Lyman) Come on, PauI!
We've got things to do!

01:29:32.283 --> 01:29:33.617
I'm sorry, Eddie.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:58.475
- Shannon!
- Shannon!

01:29:58.518 --> 01:29:59.768
Please!

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:06.233
Warning! Air contaminants at critical level.
Evacuate immediately.

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:15.575
All containment doors are now closed.

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:25.502
The tanks.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:28.422
OK, here's the elevator.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:31.383
There's room for everybody.

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:39.224
I'm looking for two men. Paul Shannon
and Lyman Collier. Hang onto them.

01:30:39.308 --> 01:30:42.853
Follow the blue evacuation route arrows
to the elevators.

01:30:42.895 --> 01:30:45.439
Move in an orderly fashion
quickly and quietly...

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:49.067
GentIemen, our friends from the FBI
wilI be here presently.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.194
Anita, we're on our way.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:55.198
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.

01:31:39.118 --> 01:31:41.786
Come on! Come on, Lily.

01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:44.498
Eddie, which way?

01:31:51.797 --> 01:31:56.676
By the way, PauI, do you have that disk?
The one with the magic frequency?

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.846
Thank you so much.

01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:25.705
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to caIl it a day.

01:32:25.748 --> 01:32:29.709
Maybe we're getting too old for this.
What do you think, huh?

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:34.339
But then again,
what would we do?

01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:37.008
What would we do?

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.470
(alarm)

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.579
(gunshots)

01:33:18.217 --> 01:33:24.055
I didn't tell you, Lyman, but your retirement
had already been arranged.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:43.116
Containment systems off.

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:50.290
Access restored to all areas.
Containment systems off.

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.925
Hey, hold on, hoId on!
Take it up, take it up!

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.364
- They got a 20 on Kasalivich?
- They found the stolen truck

01:34:22.406 --> 01:34:25.367
at the construction site one mile to the west.

01:34:28.245 --> 01:34:30.246
(Eddie) Hold on.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.251
Eddie, look.

01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:51.142
(screaming)

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:02.112
Get up, Reed. Come on, we've gotta go!

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:21.381
- (buzzer)
- You said the hole was clear!

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:23.550
Get back in the seat, Ernie.

01:35:30.307 --> 01:35:32.892
Eddie.

01:35:58.043 --> 01:35:59.294
(buzzer)

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.758
LiIy, get in the basket!

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.180
Get out of here. Go!

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.308
Eddie, come on!

01:36:16.228 --> 01:36:17.479
Eddie!

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.827
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.051
Come on, Eddie.

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:02.899
Aagh!

01:37:03.192 --> 01:37:05.902
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.254
PuIl it up, puIl it up.

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:29.133
Holy... did you see that?

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:30.969
Whoa!

01:37:31.053 --> 01:37:32.804
Come on, get 'em out of there.

01:37:42.731 --> 01:37:45.608
(cheering)

01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:50.048
- Eddie Kasalivich.
- Agent Ford. You got the message.

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:53.176
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.
What's it mean, Eddie?

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:57.680
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?

01:38:57.723 --> 01:39:00.308
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:03.519
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.

01:39:03.562 --> 01:39:08.316
Come on. You've got some questions to
answer in Washington for about six weeks.

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:11.152
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about,

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.196
as Iong as everyone stops shooting at us.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.658
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.534
Ford!

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:22.038
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.375
All right, come on, both of you.

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.981
Anita, take a memo.

01:39:48.565 --> 01:39:51.192
To the Director of CentraI InteIligence.

01:39:51.777 --> 01:39:53.319
C-Systems...

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:57.156
no longer a viable entity.

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.244
Will be in contact.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.538
That's it.

01:46:33.303 --> 01:46:35.304
Whoa!
