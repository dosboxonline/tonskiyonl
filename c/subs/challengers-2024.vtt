WEBVTT

01:04.945 --> 01:07.545
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match will be

01:07.545 --> 01:10.682
the best of
three tie-break sets.

01:10.682 --> 01:13.882
To the right of my chair,
we have Patrick Zweig.

01:13.882 --> 01:15.787
- Yes, Patrick!

01:16.797 --> 01:18.157
To the left of my chair,

01:18.157 --> 01:20.325
we have Art Donaldson.

01:27.472 --> 01:30.472
Donaldson won the toss
and has elected to serve.

01:34.976 --> 01:35.972
First set.

01:37.747 --> 01:40.185
All right!
All right,
let's bring it!

01:40.185 --> 01:42.077
Hey,
we love you, Art!

01:48.321 --> 01:49.722
Donaldson to serve.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.930
Ready? Play.

02:15.479 --> 02:17.051
Out!

02:17.051 --> 02:18.619
Fifteen, love.

02:20.521 --> 02:22.524
That's our boy.
Go, go.

02:32.431 --> 02:33.502
Fifteen all.

03:09.476 --> 03:11.336
Let's go!

03:11.336 --> 03:12.508
Fifteen, 30.

04:43.064 --> 04:44.061
Let's go.

04:57.239 --> 04:59.083
<i>Every premiere event
and the...</i>

04:59.083 --> 05:00.777
Man,
that ankle's jammed.

05:00.777 --> 05:02.915
I'll just stretch it
from here.

05:04.418 --> 05:06.382
Good. Nice and relaxed.

05:06.382 --> 05:09.119
All right,
put a little pressure back
and I want you to inhale.

05:11.596 --> 05:12.991
<i>Okay,
let's check out today's</i>

05:12.991 --> 05:15.766
<i>first round matchups.
Mary Jo, let's be honest...</i>

05:15.766 --> 05:17.393
Again.

05:17.393 --> 05:18.566
<i>I mean, it's safe to say that
Donaldson is a huge favorite</i>

05:18.566 --> 05:20.601
<i>against the French teen,
Du Maurier.</i>

05:20.601 --> 05:21.900
<i>Well, on paper, he is.</i>

05:21.900 --> 05:23.839
<i>But because
he had surgery
last year...</i>

05:23.839 --> 05:25.773
Bryan,
we have the practice court
booked at 8:00,

05:25.773 --> 05:27.739
so we should
probably head out
in about 15 minutes.

05:27.739 --> 05:29.505
Yep,
he'll be ready by then.

05:29.505 --> 05:31.314
<i>In your first two-fifty,
as a qualifier...</i>

05:31.314 --> 05:32.647
- Hey, Art? Just relax.
Lily,

05:32.647 --> 05:33.911
you have to have some fruit
with your breakfast.

05:33.911 --> 05:34.844
<i>If Art can start to get</i>

05:34.844 --> 05:36.411
<i>some confidence
and play well.</i>

05:36.411 --> 05:37.482
<i>This is a great opportunity
to end that losing streak</i>

05:37.482 --> 05:38.852
<i>going into the US Open.</i>

05:38.852 --> 05:40.148
<i>Feels like he needs this win.</i>

05:40.148 --> 05:41.918
<i>Remember what he's
going for this year.</i>

05:41.918 --> 05:43.624
<i>He's got the six
Grand Slam titles,</i>

05:43.624 --> 05:46.028
<i>two at Wimbledon,
two Aussie Opens,</i>

05:46.028 --> 05:47.330
<i>two French Opens,</i>

05:47.330 --> 05:49.532
<i>but he has been
chasing in vain,</i>

05:49.532 --> 05:51.927
<i>for years,
that elusive
US Open title</i>

05:51.927 --> 05:54.100
<i>to complete
the Career Slam.</i>

05:54.100 --> 05:56.441
<i>What do you think,
any shot that he
gets it this year?</i>

05:56.441 --> 05:57.871
<i>I mean,
it's not looking good.</i>

05:57.871 --> 05:59.935
<i>I mean, if we just go
on the results this season,</i>

05:59.935 --> 06:01.780
<i>it's going to be
tough for him.</i>

06:01.780 --> 06:04.010
<i>But you can never
count a guy like Art
out of the conversation.</i>

06:04.010 --> 06:07.285
<i>He's got himself back healthy,
he's in really good shape,</i>

06:07.285 --> 06:09.278
<i>he's got a great
support team around him.</i>

06:09.278 --> 06:12.213
<i>His coach, Tashi Donaldson,
who also is his wife,</i>

06:12.213 --> 06:14.022
<i>has added a couple
of people to his team.</i>

06:14.022 --> 06:16.361
<i>He's got a new physiotherapist,
and he's got
a new hitting partner.</i>

06:16.361 --> 06:18.795
<i>So everything's there
for him to do well.</i>

06:18.795 --> 06:21.125
<i>Now it's just the matter
can he get his game
back on track.</i>

06:21.125 --> 06:22.527
<i>Yeah,
his fans are hoping we'll start</i>

06:22.527 --> 06:23.796
<i>to see more of the...</i>

06:23.796 --> 06:25.503
All right, I'm going
to go check on the car.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.506
Can you have pancakes?

06:29.107 --> 06:30.167
I don't know, can I?

06:31.744 --> 06:32.904
Feed me.

06:32.904 --> 06:35.137
- No, you're too old.
- No, who says that?

06:35.137 --> 06:36.980
- Who said I'm old?
You said that.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.040
Here.
- No,

06:38.040 --> 06:39.251
grandmas can
have pancakes,
come on.

06:39.251 --> 06:40.516
<i>Just a matter of...</i>

06:40.516 --> 06:42.148
One bite.
I won't tell.

06:42.148 --> 06:43.687
<i>...if he can click
into that mindset.</i>

06:43.687 --> 06:44.816
<i>Exactly.
And you know he's got</i>

06:44.816 --> 06:46.316
<i>a lot of things
going for him here.</i>

06:46.316 --> 06:48.026
<i>He knows this tournament,
he likes this tournament,</i>

06:48.026 --> 06:49.492
<i>and he's won here a few times.</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.820
<i>And he's got
a great record on hard courts.</i>

06:51.820 --> 06:52.990
<i>So, if he can somehow</i>

06:52.990 --> 06:54.389
<i>- find a way to get...</i>

06:54.389 --> 06:55.764
Your mom and dad are
going to go to work,

06:55.764 --> 06:56.761
and then you and me
are gonna do
some reading,

06:56.761 --> 06:58.333
and then go swimming
at the pool.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.901
Can we watch a movie?

06:59.901 --> 07:01.863
Later,
first we're gonna
keep reading the book

07:01.863 --> 07:03.237
we started yesterday.

07:04.439 --> 07:06.101
The one about the giraffe?

07:06.101 --> 07:07.673
Mm, no,
we finished that one.

07:07.673 --> 07:09.177
We're gonna keep
reading the one...

07:09.177 --> 07:10.112
Inside out!

07:11.706 --> 07:12.781
Cross.

07:15.052 --> 07:15.883
Inside out.

07:17.616 --> 07:18.457
Down the line.

07:21.218 --> 07:22.857
There was
a massager in the car?

07:22.857 --> 07:25.086
You grabbed that, right?
- No, the other one.

07:25.086 --> 07:26.864
Oh, yeah,
it's in there.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.598
I want you to force him
into as many
backhand rallies as you can.

07:29.598 --> 07:31.060
He has one big weapon,
and he wants to use it

07:31.060 --> 07:32.801
against you,
so take it away from him.

07:36.267 --> 07:38.273
<i>The BB and T Atlanta Open</i>

07:38.273 --> 07:40.478
<i>is a non-smoking event.</i>

07:40.478 --> 07:43.238
<i>All use of tobacco products
and e-cigarettes</i>

07:43.238 --> 07:45.316
<i>is strictly prohibited
on event grounds</i>

07:45.316 --> 07:46.616
<i>except for designated
smoking areas.</i>

07:46.616 --> 07:49.881
Mr. Donaldson...
Mr. Donaldson, would you?

07:49.881 --> 07:51.589
- Thank you so much.
No problem.

07:51.589 --> 07:53.316
I'm rooting for you.
- Did you see that look?

07:53.316 --> 07:55.783
- He's gonna crush me, huh?
- Don't think about it, Leo.

07:56.822 --> 07:58.662
Art, over here, over here!

08:41.535 --> 08:42.497
Yeah?

08:43.472 --> 08:44.708
They're ready for you.

08:50.378 --> 08:51.374
You ready?

08:58.488 --> 08:59.657
Decimate that little bitch.

09:55.078 --> 09:56.514
<i>Yeah,
this match is looking like</i>

09:56.514 --> 09:58.277
<i>what we've come to expect
from Donaldson.</i>

09:58.277 --> 10:00.216
<i>Just can't seem
to find his footing.</i>

10:00.216 --> 10:03.553
<i>And it's given Du Maurier
the confidence he needs.</i>

10:03.553 --> 10:04.749
<i>Out!</i>
<i>Ouch,</i>

10:04.749 --> 10:06.385
<i>this is getting brutal.</i>

10:06.385 --> 10:08.851
<i>You just can't
be missing shots like that.</i>

10:17.128 --> 10:18.693
<i>And there goes the racket.</i>

10:18.693 --> 10:20.529
<i>Yeah, you...</i>
- He was playing really well.

10:20.529 --> 10:21.604
<i>...can really see
the frustration setting in.</i>

10:21.604 --> 10:22.804
<i>I mean, I get it.</i>

10:22.804 --> 10:23.966
I'm pulling you
out of Cincinnati.

10:23.966 --> 10:25.243
- Baby.
- Might as well

10:25.243 --> 10:26.711
pull you out of the Open too,

10:26.711 --> 10:28.710
if this isn't gonna be
your year then,
why bother?

10:28.710 --> 10:30.446
I'm just rusty.
It's a confidence thing.

10:30.446 --> 10:32.178
Get your fucking
confidence back.

10:33.153 --> 10:34.218
I can't do that for you.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.080
No one's asking you to.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.348
When you play
like that, you are.

10:38.824 --> 10:40.920
I would've killed
to have a recovery
like yours.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.327
I literally would
fucking stab someone.

10:43.327 --> 10:44.728
A child, an old lady, like...

10:44.728 --> 10:46.291
I think that
they're almost done, okay?

10:46.291 --> 10:48.062
Where are they?
In the living room.

10:48.062 --> 10:50.328
They're watching Daddy's match
from earlier today.

10:51.537 --> 10:52.835
Mom said
we could watch it.

10:52.835 --> 10:55.168
What do we need to do
to get you to play again?

10:57.169 --> 10:58.941
What do you
need me to do, hmm?

11:02.545 --> 11:04.142
- Hey, baby.
- Mommy?

11:04.142 --> 11:06.981
- What's up?
- Can we watch <i>Spider-Verse?</i>

11:06.981 --> 11:09.817
Of course we can.
Of course we can.
Come here.

11:09.817 --> 11:11.181
We're just talking about
tennis right now.

11:11.181 --> 11:13.289
But you're always
talking about tennis.

11:13.289 --> 11:15.155
I know. I know.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.352
Uh, ooh, how about this?

11:17.352 --> 11:18.858
How about you
start it with Grandma?

11:18.858 --> 11:20.458
And then,
I'll come in a second

11:20.458 --> 11:22.357
and we can
order some room service
and watch it together.

11:22.357 --> 11:24.025
- How about that?
What do they have

11:24.025 --> 11:25.196
for room service?

11:25.196 --> 11:26.831
I don't know.
I don't know, I...

11:33.742 --> 11:35.175
She likes it here.

11:38.317 --> 11:39.751
We can keep staying here.

11:43.484 --> 11:44.481
We can.

11:46.220 --> 11:51.562
We can stay here.
We can just be rich people.

11:51.562 --> 11:53.259
That's all you
think you can handle.

11:54.695 --> 11:56.225
We can travel.

11:56.225 --> 11:58.066
We can do
the foundation full-time.

12:00.099 --> 12:01.872
Or you keep being
a tennis player.

12:04.234 --> 12:06.536
Which is what you are. Still.

12:09.512 --> 12:10.408
What do you want?

12:24.958 --> 12:26.358
What do you want?

12:27.700 --> 12:29.892
I'm gonna be a tennis player.

12:29.892 --> 12:32.736
Good. Good.

12:32.736 --> 12:34.338
Okay,
well, we need to get you

12:34.338 --> 12:35.570
some more match time then.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.069
I can play Cincinnati.

12:37.069 --> 12:39.272
No. No, you cannot.
Not like this.

12:40.477 --> 12:42.280
Okay, how about,

12:42.280 --> 12:43.309
how about New Rochelle?

12:46.411 --> 12:48.777
- That's a challenger.
- Yeah, I know that.

12:48.777 --> 12:51.383
It's in a couple of days.
Maybe we can get you
a wildcard.

12:54.722 --> 12:56.058
- Art?
- Hmm.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.654
You need to start winning.

13:00.659 --> 13:03.560
Right now,
you're getting crushed
by guys like Du Maurier.

13:05.405 --> 13:07.537
So we need to go somewhere,

13:07.537 --> 13:09.701
where there's absolutely nobody

13:09.701 --> 13:12.668
on the other side of the net
who can shake
your fucking confidence.

13:14.575 --> 13:16.139
Okay?

13:16.139 --> 13:18.541
That's why we're going to...

13:18.541 --> 13:21.820
- Phil's Tire Town Challenger.

13:24.122 --> 13:26.080
- Don't get knocked out
the first round.
- You're evil.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.490
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call Tom,
see if he can get you
in the draw.

13:28.490 --> 13:29.828
- Hey.
- Yeah.

13:31.087 --> 13:31.995
I love you.

13:33.297 --> 13:35.090
I know.

13:35.090 --> 13:36.626
<i>How much
do you think you'd pay
the first serve today?</i>

13:36.626 --> 13:38.292
<i>Honestly.
He looks like he doesn't</i>

13:38.292 --> 13:39.568
<i>even wanna be out there.</i>

14:09.300 --> 14:10.334
Hey!

14:10.334 --> 14:12.836
Can I pay tomorrow?

14:12.836 --> 14:16.336
I've been driving all day,
I'm exhausted.

14:16.336 --> 14:18.500
You know, if we gave out
a bed to every tired person

14:18.500 --> 14:20.873
who walked in here
asking for one...

14:20.873 --> 14:22.176
Right.

14:22.176 --> 14:24.810
...we'd be a homeless shelter
not a business.

14:24.810 --> 14:25.840
Uh-huh.

14:28.653 --> 14:30.878
Listen, I'm a tennis player.

14:30.878 --> 14:33.391
Hmm.
- You know the tournament
down the road?

14:33.391 --> 14:35.022
Oh, that, uh... The thing

14:35.022 --> 14:36.959
- at the country club.
- Right, right.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.961
- Yeah.
- Well, you get $7,000
if you win.

14:39.961 --> 14:43.196
And you get money
just for qualifying.

14:43.196 --> 14:45.461
I just...
I need a place
to stay tonight

14:45.461 --> 14:46.963
so I can rest before
my first match.

14:46.963 --> 14:50.133
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:50.133 --> 14:52.502
I need a card on file.

14:52.502 --> 14:54.411
What if I signed a racket
and gave it to you?

14:54.411 --> 14:55.703
- Sir.
- Mm-hmm.

14:55.703 --> 14:58.543
Sir, I don't know
who you are.

15:03.582 --> 15:04.886
I told you I'm...
- Look at this guy.

15:04.886 --> 15:05.986
...a professional
tennis player.

15:05.986 --> 15:07.517
- He's a disaster.
- I don't know,

15:07.517 --> 15:10.685
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Carl, he smells.

15:10.685 --> 15:12.060
- The racket alone...
He's an athlete.

15:12.060 --> 15:13.324
- ...is worth like...
He doesn't look

15:13.324 --> 15:14.858
like an athlete,
he looks like a hobo.

15:14.858 --> 15:15.931
...$300.

15:15.931 --> 15:17.494
Very tall,
very handsome hobo.

15:17.494 --> 15:19.668
You're like a dog.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.071
We need a card that works.

15:22.071 --> 15:24.036
Look at him,
he can't pay for the room.

15:24.036 --> 15:25.171
Should we invite him

15:25.171 --> 15:26.604
- to come stay with us?

15:29.414 --> 15:30.410
Hey!

15:31.482 --> 15:34.342
Hello! Name?

15:34.342 --> 15:36.218
Barry Gardner.

15:36.218 --> 15:39.087
You know,
this looks very different
from the website.

15:39.087 --> 15:41.125
Oh, we're doing
some renovations.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.692
I just think you should
maybe update your pictures

15:43.692 --> 15:44.962
to reflect, you know...

15:44.962 --> 15:48.031
<i>The Clinton campaign paid</i>

15:48.031 --> 15:52.795
<i>a million dollars
to use your GPS to hire...</i>

16:40.279 --> 16:41.679
Sir, you can't sleep here.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.088
I'm not.
I'm playing at the...

16:49.088 --> 16:51.126
Sir, this is a private club.

16:51.126 --> 16:52.289
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
No.

16:52.289 --> 16:53.358
- ...to leave.
- No, no, no.

16:53.358 --> 16:55.528
I'm in the Challenger.
I'm a player.

16:56.868 --> 16:59.334
- Oh. Well...

17:02.171 --> 17:03.635
You're a bit early
for check-in.

17:04.368 --> 17:05.806
We're just opening up.

17:22.919 --> 17:25.387
Just head right in there.
She's just setting up.

17:35.336 --> 17:37.741
Can I help you?

17:37.741 --> 17:39.935
I'm a tennis player.

17:42.374 --> 17:45.380
I'm playing
in the Challenger.

17:45.945 --> 17:47.517
Name?

17:47.517 --> 17:49.010
Patrick Zweig.

17:51.384 --> 17:53.489
Oh, wow!
That's right.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.588
You are!

17:58.557 --> 17:59.555
You probably
don't remember this,

17:59.555 --> 18:01.558
but I was
one of the line judges

18:01.558 --> 18:03.629
at the Junior US Open
back in '06.

18:06.966 --> 18:08.964
Huh, wow.

18:13.270 --> 18:14.442
You hungry?

18:15.612 --> 18:16.807
Uh...

18:17.648 --> 18:18.875
Yeah. Yeah.

18:20.111 --> 18:21.251
Thanks.

18:26.416 --> 18:27.752
Mm-mm.

18:28.719 --> 18:30.524
Well, we're happy
to have you here.

18:30.524 --> 18:35.928
You got your first match
against Grosu this afternoon.

18:35.928 --> 18:38.597
Should be a nice tournament.
Supposed to get
a little windy mid-week,

18:38.597 --> 18:40.904
but hopefully it'll clear up
before the finals.

18:40.904 --> 18:42.604
- Fingers crossed.
- I was wondering,

18:42.604 --> 18:44.769
is there any chance
for an advance payment
on the prize money?

18:46.141 --> 18:48.374
- Oh.
- Just because I'm...

18:48.374 --> 18:50.474
I know I'm guaranteed
a minimum of $400

18:50.474 --> 18:52.249
even if I get
knocked out today.

18:52.249 --> 18:54.546
Well, generally, we don't give
out the winnings until

18:54.546 --> 18:55.883
player makes his way
through the tournament.

18:55.883 --> 18:57.384
Right. It's just...

18:57.384 --> 18:59.481
I had a problem
with my card at the hotel.

18:59.481 --> 19:01.255
- And...
- You could

19:01.255 --> 19:02.917
just always lose today...

19:02.917 --> 19:04.855
Then we'd have to cut
your check this evening.

19:09.028 --> 19:10.025
Right.

19:16.839 --> 19:18.402
By the way,

19:18.402 --> 19:20.010
there's a rumor
going around

19:20.010 --> 19:21.938
that we had
a last-minute wildcard.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.546
Wanna guess who it is?

19:26.650 --> 19:27.776
Who?

20:13.864 --> 20:15.497
Advantage, Donaldson.

20:22.732 --> 20:24.935
Come on!
Go, let's go!

20:29.244 --> 20:30.413
- Fault!

20:39.022 --> 20:40.588
- Fuck!

20:42.051 --> 20:44.552
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

20:44.552 --> 20:46.220
Warning, Donaldson.

20:47.797 --> 20:48.959
Deuce.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.134
All right.
Come on, Art.

21:09.743 --> 21:12.288
Advantage, Zweig.

21:12.288 --> 21:14.389
Get it together, Art.
You got this.

21:14.389 --> 21:16.591
He almost got
another penalty.

21:48.484 --> 21:49.921
Yeah!

21:50.321 --> 21:51.362
Yes!

21:52.591 --> 21:55.157
- Let's go!

21:56.701 --> 21:57.863
Yeah!

22:00.168 --> 22:01.498
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

22:01.498 --> 22:04.441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

22:06.311 --> 22:07.405
Hey, guys!
Hey, guys!

22:07.405 --> 22:08.805
Thank you, man.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.071
- Good play.
Good one, man.

22:10.071 --> 22:11.507
Nice meeting you.
- Good one, man.

22:11.507 --> 22:12.683
Yeah.

22:15.286 --> 22:16.787
Fire and Ice, baby.
Let's go!

22:16.787 --> 22:18.417
Take it off!

22:25.330 --> 22:27.494
- Can you do me a favor?
Mm-hmm.

22:27.494 --> 22:29.296
Can you not
demolish me tomorrow?

22:29.296 --> 22:30.665
- Shut the fuck up.
- Listen,

22:30.665 --> 22:32.861
I'm at peace with the fact
that you're going to win.

22:32.861 --> 22:34.502
- It's not a fact.
- I'm just saying,

22:34.502 --> 22:37.673
throw me
a couple of games,
maybe a set.

22:37.673 --> 22:39.966
If it matters to you so much,
I can just give it to you.

22:39.966 --> 22:41.274
Really?
Yeah.

22:41.274 --> 22:42.510
- Wow! Thanks.
- I mean,

22:42.510 --> 22:43.973
every once in a while
a kid who wins juniors

22:43.973 --> 22:45.943
turns out to be
an actually great player,

22:45.943 --> 22:48.546
but most of them end up
in, like, the top 300.

22:48.546 --> 22:50.181
- It's a curse.
- You said,

22:50.181 --> 22:52.520
you seemed pretty excited
about winning
the doubles trophy.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.957
That was different.
That was just you and me.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.086
This is really fun.

22:57.554 --> 22:58.726
Huh.

23:00.162 --> 23:01.399
All right, well...

23:02.760 --> 23:04.233
But you have to actually play.

23:04.233 --> 23:05.665
You know,
you can't just retire.

23:05.665 --> 23:07.337
I need it to look like
I really beat you.

23:07.337 --> 23:09.636
Mm. Have you got money
on this or something?

23:09.636 --> 23:11.671
No. My grandma,
she's gonna be watching

23:11.671 --> 23:13.472
with her nursing home.
She keeps calling me

23:13.472 --> 23:15.642
telling me
how proud she is.

23:15.642 --> 23:17.242
Don't guilt me
with your dying grandmother.

23:29.689 --> 23:31.321
Now entering the court...

23:31.321 --> 23:33.492
Did Mark tell you
about the party
on Long Island?

23:33.492 --> 23:35.025
- The Adidas thing?
- Yeah.

23:35.025 --> 23:36.767
Anna Mueller.
- Yeah, I'm not going.

23:36.767 --> 23:37.860
What? Why not?

23:37.860 --> 23:40.096
We have
a final tomorrow.

23:40.096 --> 23:42.572
- I just told you
I'd let you win.
Mm-hmm.

23:42.572 --> 23:45.906
- Don't you want
to meet Tashi Duncan?

23:45.906 --> 23:48.077
You don't get it, man.
You've never seen her
in person.

23:48.077 --> 23:49.447
She's in another league.

23:49.447 --> 23:50.944
And now entering...
- You mean her game?

23:50.944 --> 23:53.044
No, I mean,
she's the hottest woman
I've ever seen.

23:53.044 --> 23:55.885
And winner
of the Junior Australian Open,

23:55.885 --> 23:57.112
Tashi Duncan.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.253
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

24:23.847 --> 24:26.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
this final round match

24:26.140 --> 24:28.484
will be the best
of three tie-break sets.

24:28.484 --> 24:30.414
To the left of the chair,
from Switzerland,

24:30.414 --> 24:32.248
Anna Mueller.

24:32.248 --> 24:34.385
To the right of the chair,
from the United States,

24:34.385 --> 24:36.151
Tashi Duncan.

24:36.151 --> 24:38.652
Duncan won the toss
and elected to serve.

24:38.652 --> 24:39.794
Fuck.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.772
First set,
Duncan to serve.
Ready?

24:52.041 --> 24:52.873
Play.

25:07.116 --> 25:09.021
Look at that
fucking backhand.

25:13.626 --> 25:14.623
Fifteen, love.

25:38.484 --> 25:39.854
Forty, love.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.182
Come on!

26:12.421 --> 26:13.415
Forty, thirty.

27:10.477 --> 27:14.042
She's gonna
turn her whole family
into millionaires.

27:14.042 --> 27:16.043
She'll have a fashion line,

27:16.043 --> 27:17.787
a nutritional supplement,

27:18.453 --> 27:20.589
a foundation.

27:20.589 --> 27:22.591
The Tashi Duncan Center
for Girls.

27:22.591 --> 27:24.486
Taking at-risk youth
off the streets

27:24.486 --> 27:26.121
- and onto the courts.
- Come on. Don't make fun, man.

27:26.121 --> 27:27.656
She's a remarkable
young woman.

27:27.656 --> 27:29.599
I know.

27:29.599 --> 27:31.702
I know,
she's a pillar
of the community.

27:34.201 --> 27:37.103
I'd let her fuck me
with a racket.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.640
Oh, God.
Look, Anna Mueller.

28:31.659 --> 28:34.829
- Oh, my God.
- Oy.

28:34.829 --> 28:36.558
I'm gonna go get my drink.

28:43.708 --> 28:45.703
- Hey, I'm Patrick Zweig.
- Art Donaldson.

28:45.703 --> 28:47.041
I know who you are.

28:47.841 --> 28:49.071
You're Fire and Ice, right?

28:49.071 --> 28:50.748
- Oh, my God.
- In the flesh.

28:54.076 --> 28:55.317
Which one's which?

28:55.317 --> 28:56.710
What do you think?

28:58.085 --> 29:00.347
You were
fucking incredible today.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.425
- Thank you.
- No, really. I mean,

29:01.425 --> 29:03.417
it wasn't even,
like, tennis.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.085
It was an entirely
different game.

29:05.085 --> 29:06.892
I felt bad for Anna.

29:06.892 --> 29:08.555
Oh, uh, don't.
She's a sore loser

29:08.555 --> 29:10.196
- And a racist bitch.

29:12.699 --> 29:13.694
She'll be okay.

29:15.706 --> 29:17.032
You're going
to Stanford, right?

29:17.032 --> 29:18.402
Yeah, how'd you know that?

29:19.875 --> 29:22.741
Um...
I just accepted my offer

29:22.741 --> 29:24.281
and they mentioned you.

29:24.281 --> 29:25.372
- Really?
Yeah.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.641
Oh.
- You're not going pro?

29:28.714 --> 29:29.820
No, not yet.

29:31.923 --> 29:34.357
Why do you waste your time
playing college tennis?

29:34.357 --> 29:36.450
Baby...

29:36.450 --> 29:38.121
I need to steal you
for a second.

29:38.121 --> 29:39.995
- Over at the trophies.
- Uh, okay.

29:40.927 --> 29:42.566
I have to go
take pictures.

29:42.566 --> 29:45.225
So, um, it was nice
meeting you both.

29:45.225 --> 29:46.298
- Yeah.
Yeah.

29:49.505 --> 29:50.500
Okay.

30:10.095 --> 30:11.560
Now what?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.760
What do you mean?
That was it.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.592
You don't wanna
stick around,

30:14.592 --> 30:16.263
- try to talk to her again?
- No, no, that'll seem
too desperate.

30:16.263 --> 30:18.333
We should just wait
for the shuttle back
to the hotel.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.463
Yeah, sure.

30:20.369 --> 30:21.432
Okay.

30:23.204 --> 30:24.498
Bring it up
for me a little bit.

30:24.498 --> 30:27.042
All right.
Great, great.
Good job.

30:31.109 --> 30:33.048
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's go.

30:43.288 --> 30:45.922
Bye,
Miss Stanford University.

30:45.922 --> 30:47.029
Okay, bye.

30:49.565 --> 30:50.560
- Hey!
- Hi!

30:52.027 --> 30:53.068
Hi.

30:54.670 --> 30:56.003
You guys are still here.

30:56.003 --> 30:57.567
Great party!
Uh-huh, yeah.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.602
Thank you.

30:59.602 --> 31:01.868
Um, don't you guys
have a final?

31:01.868 --> 31:04.508
Shouldn't you be, like, um,
preparing or something?

31:04.508 --> 31:05.942
- Oh, it's just the juniors.
- I think we both know

31:05.942 --> 31:07.082
how it's gonna go.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.182
Okay, well, um,
it's cool that you stayed.

31:11.182 --> 31:12.349
- Yeah. I actually wanted...
- Yeah.

31:12.349 --> 31:13.480
...to ask you about
that point earlier--

31:13.480 --> 31:15.621
- Hey, do you smoke?
- Cigarettes?

31:15.621 --> 31:16.652
- Yeah.
- No.

31:17.857 --> 31:19.754
- Do you?
- Yeah.

31:20.896 --> 31:22.163
Want to go down
to the beach?

31:26.567 --> 31:27.804
Sure.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.203
This place is ridiculous,
isn't it?

31:29.203 --> 31:31.365
What do you mean?
What do you mean? It's nice.

31:31.365 --> 31:33.569
It's like a castle.

31:33.569 --> 31:35.506
Like, they wanna be
feudal lords or something.

31:35.506 --> 31:37.708
Oh, and what does
your parents' place look like?

31:37.708 --> 31:39.047
Exactly.

31:39.047 --> 31:40.816
Not like this.
No, it's bigger.

31:40.816 --> 31:44.179
No. I mean, yeah,
technically it is. Yeah.

31:49.425 --> 31:52.262
So,
I have to ask you about
this Stanford thing.

31:52.262 --> 31:53.359
Okay.

31:55.466 --> 31:57.825
What's the angle?

31:57.825 --> 32:00.167
Why do you want to go beat up
on a bunch of girls

32:00.167 --> 32:02.203
who were the best players
at their high schools?

32:08.539 --> 32:11.678
You know,
they offer classes
in college.

32:11.678 --> 32:14.479
I don't want
my only skill in life to be
hitting a ball with a racket.

32:15.748 --> 32:16.811
I get it.

32:19.416 --> 32:20.584
You're making us
wait for you.

32:22.959 --> 32:25.057
The 18-year-old
tennis phenomenon

32:25.057 --> 32:26.755
who cares about
her education.

32:28.096 --> 32:29.593
Is this why you
came to my party?

32:31.262 --> 32:33.231
It's brilliant. Seriously.

32:33.231 --> 32:35.434
I can already see
the Adidas campaign.

32:36.938 --> 32:38.107
And when are you going pro?

32:40.236 --> 32:41.506
Soon as I can.

32:42.771 --> 32:44.613
Hitting a ball with a racket
is a great way

32:44.613 --> 32:46.144
to avoid having a job.

32:46.144 --> 32:48.378
Well, that's also
your problem.

32:48.378 --> 32:50.116
'Cause you think
that tennis is about

32:50.116 --> 32:52.253
expressing yourself,
doing your thing.

32:52.253 --> 32:54.783
- That's why you
still have that serve.
- It works.

32:56.619 --> 32:58.325
Yeah, but you're not
a tennis player.

33:00.523 --> 33:02.032
You don't know
what tennis is.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.331
What is it?

33:05.834 --> 33:07.268
It's a relationship.

33:13.109 --> 33:14.770
Is that what you
and Anna Mueller
had today?

33:16.811 --> 33:18.048
It is, actually.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.775
For about 15 seconds there,
we were actually
playing tennis,

33:22.775 --> 33:24.950
and we understood
each other completely.

33:24.950 --> 33:26.155
So did everyone watching.

33:27.626 --> 33:29.158
It was like we were in love.

33:33.895 --> 33:35.560
Or like we didn't exist.

33:39.471 --> 33:40.730
We went somewhere

33:41.805 --> 33:43.296
really beautiful together.

33:43.296 --> 33:44.239
You screamed.

33:50.681 --> 33:52.816
When you hit the winner.

33:52.816 --> 33:54.711
Never heard
anything like it before.

34:06.255 --> 34:07.457
I should go

34:07.457 --> 34:09.657
before my dad comes
looking for me.

34:09.657 --> 34:11.624
- I'll see you at school, Art.
- Wait,

34:11.624 --> 34:13.902
- are you on Facebook?
- What?

34:13.902 --> 34:15.204
He's asking
for your number.

34:16.364 --> 34:17.404
And so am I.

34:19.077 --> 34:21.205
- You both want my number?
- Very much so, yeah.

34:21.205 --> 34:23.145
Yeah.
- Okay, well,

34:23.145 --> 34:25.040
- I'm not a homewrecker.
- We don't live together.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.578
- It's an open relationship.
- Also, Patrick has
a girlfriend.

34:27.578 --> 34:30.053
I do not. Hey,
come hang out
with us later.

34:30.053 --> 34:32.716
They put you up at the hotel
in Flushing, right?

34:32.716 --> 34:35.087
- We're in Room 206.
- Want me to come
tuck you in?

34:35.087 --> 34:37.886
No. We just keep talking...

34:38.629 --> 34:39.855
About tennis.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.899
Good night.

34:43.899 --> 34:46.059
- We have beer.
Okay.

35:12.161 --> 35:14.792
I'm looking
in my bag right now.

35:14.792 --> 35:17.524
Did you look
in the small pocket
on the side?

35:17.524 --> 35:19.032
I promise that's in there.

35:24.436 --> 35:27.735
- It's broken.

35:27.735 --> 35:31.137
- And she's not coming.
- She might.

35:31.137 --> 35:33.377
You made it sound like
we wanted to fuck her in here.

35:33.377 --> 35:34.578
We do want to
fuck her in here.

35:34.578 --> 35:37.616
Okay, yeah, maybe.
But what was your plan?

35:37.616 --> 35:39.923
All right, let's say
she did come over.
Then what?

35:39.923 --> 35:41.752
We just like,
keep shooting our shot

35:41.752 --> 35:44.621
until she ends up making out
with one of us, hopefully,

35:44.621 --> 35:46.960
and the other one,
sits in the bathroom?

35:46.960 --> 35:48.662
Sure, if it came to that.

35:48.662 --> 35:51.228
- What?
You think that's beneath you?
- I think it's beneath her.

35:51.228 --> 35:52.563
What if she chooses you?

35:52.563 --> 35:54.099
You won't feel comfortable
sending me away?

35:54.099 --> 35:55.770
She's not coming, Patrick!

36:12.990 --> 36:14.288
Art!
What?

36:14.288 --> 36:15.854
Fucking ash!
I found it.

36:15.854 --> 36:16.886
Oh, dude.

36:21.665 --> 36:22.496
Wait.

36:23.061 --> 36:24.058
Oh, shit.

36:25.670 --> 36:26.863
- Hi!
- Hey!

36:28.571 --> 36:31.533
Did you guys go to, like,
Mommy And Me classes
together?

36:33.804 --> 36:35.545
What?
You just seem like brothers.

36:35.545 --> 36:38.706
Well, that's what
the Mark Rebellato
Tennis Academy will do for you.

36:38.706 --> 36:40.643
Oh. Right, right, right.

36:40.643 --> 36:42.184
You guys went
to boarding school.

36:42.184 --> 36:44.645
Mm.
We've been bunkmates
since we were 12.

36:44.645 --> 36:46.013
- So...
- That's really cute.

36:46.013 --> 36:47.714
You ever thought about
doing something like that?

36:47.714 --> 36:48.849
- Boarding school?
Mm.

36:48.849 --> 36:50.293
No. No, no, no.
We couldn't afford it.

36:50.293 --> 36:52.128
And even if I could get
a scholarship or something,

36:52.128 --> 36:53.558
there's no way that
my parents would want me

36:53.558 --> 36:55.331
coming of age
in an environment like that.

36:56.325 --> 36:57.494
Huh.

36:57.494 --> 36:59.368
Why? What were
they afraid of?

37:03.170 --> 37:05.241
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

37:05.241 --> 37:07.700
So, um, is that
where you met your girlfriend?

37:07.700 --> 37:09.169
Oh, she's not my, um...

37:10.109 --> 37:11.510
Yeah, yeah.

37:11.510 --> 37:13.046
And you?
Why aren't you pretending

37:13.046 --> 37:14.149
not to have a girlfriend?

37:14.149 --> 37:16.042
- Art's in between ladies.
- Oh, no, no.

37:16.042 --> 37:17.347
That makes it sound
like I'm some sort of...

37:17.347 --> 37:18.417
Player.
- Yeah.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.188
Yeah,
Art does fine
for himself.

37:20.188 --> 37:22.358
- I mean, look at him.

37:22.956 --> 37:23.953
So...

37:26.557 --> 37:28.097
How often
does this happen?

37:28.097 --> 37:30.198
- Uh...
- Going after the same girl.

37:30.198 --> 37:31.427
Not as often
as you think actually.

37:31.427 --> 37:32.427
- Really?
No.

37:32.427 --> 37:33.695
Yeah, no, we, uh...

37:33.695 --> 37:35.061
We usually have
different types.

37:35.061 --> 37:38.003
Hmm. So you're saying
I should be flattered?

37:38.003 --> 37:39.337
- Well...
- No.

37:39.337 --> 37:40.772
Aren't you
everybody's type?

37:47.314 --> 37:48.751
What about the two of you?

37:48.751 --> 37:50.111
What do you mean?

37:55.285 --> 37:56.690
Oh!

37:56.690 --> 37:57.792
No.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.494
No.

38:01.063 --> 38:02.959
Why? Is that surprising?

38:08.639 --> 38:09.804
What?

38:09.804 --> 38:11.132
- Well...
- No.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.538
- I mean...
- No.

38:14.538 --> 38:16.277
- Patrick, no.
Sorry.

38:16.277 --> 38:17.475
Yes. I think you need
to tell me now.

38:17.475 --> 38:19.105
- No.
- I think it's a sweet story.

38:19.105 --> 38:21.245
- Uh-huh. All right.
- Well, let's hear it.

38:21.245 --> 38:22.808
Yeah, no, go ahead.

38:22.808 --> 38:24.086
- Uh...

38:24.086 --> 38:27.247
I taught Art
how to jerk off, so.

38:30.591 --> 38:33.293
Okay. Patrick was
an early bloomer, okay?

38:33.293 --> 38:35.327
And I think
that I was on time.

38:35.327 --> 38:38.334
And one time,
when we were 12,

38:38.334 --> 38:41.437
he thought I was asleep
and he was, you know...

38:42.867 --> 38:44.107
- Jerking off.
- Jerking off. And, yeah...

38:44.107 --> 38:46.336
And I asked him,
"What are you doing?"

38:46.336 --> 38:47.505
And he told me.

38:47.505 --> 38:49.105
- He's jerking off.
- Jerking off.

38:49.105 --> 38:52.144
He asked me if
I had ever done it before
and I told him no.

38:52.144 --> 38:54.714
And so, he just...

38:55.314 --> 38:57.153
He showed me how.

39:00.324 --> 39:02.120
What do you mean
he showed you how?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.256
No. I mean...

39:03.256 --> 39:04.927
- Well...
I mean, he did it

39:04.927 --> 39:06.796
- on his bed.
- Okay.

39:06.796 --> 39:09.196
I did it on my bed.
We did it together,
but like on opposite sides...

39:09.196 --> 39:10.592
- in the room.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

39:10.592 --> 39:11.896
You know.

39:15.134 --> 39:16.037
Silent?

39:16.037 --> 39:17.372
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no.

39:17.372 --> 39:19.933
No, we were talking
about Kat, weren't we?

39:19.933 --> 39:21.109
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Patrick said

39:21.109 --> 39:22.278
- it's always better...
- Yeah.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.444
...if you're like thinking
about somebody

39:23.444 --> 39:25.043
when you're doing it.
And so I asked him

39:25.043 --> 39:27.149
who you're thinking about,
and he was talking
about this girl,

39:27.149 --> 39:28.612
- Kat Zimmerman.
- Kat Zimmerman.

39:28.612 --> 39:31.344
And so, I thought
about her, too.

39:32.747 --> 39:34.146
- Wow.
- Yeah.

39:34.146 --> 39:37.325
Okay,
and who finished first?

39:37.325 --> 39:38.758
- Oh, I don't remember.
- I think you.

39:40.497 --> 39:44.466
And, well,
how was it afterwards?

39:44.466 --> 39:46.398
I think Art
was a little surprised

39:46.398 --> 39:48.294
by the whole thing.
He was...

39:48.294 --> 39:50.868
He was just sitting there
covered in all of it.

39:50.868 --> 39:52.538
What?
- He looked like a kid

39:52.538 --> 39:54.177
who'd spilled milk
all over his lap.

39:54.177 --> 39:56.542
Jesus, Patrick!

39:56.542 --> 39:57.905
I knew enough already
at this point

39:57.905 --> 40:00.072
- to have a sock nearby.
- Right.

40:00.072 --> 40:01.476
Forgot to tell Art
about that part.

40:01.476 --> 40:02.817
Yeah.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.783
Mm-hmm.

40:05.352 --> 40:06.385
Yeah, so.

40:06.385 --> 40:09.488
Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

40:09.488 --> 40:12.492
And what about
Miss Zimmerman?

40:12.492 --> 40:14.629
Whatever happened to her?
You guys...

40:15.757 --> 40:17.158
Neither of us...

40:17.158 --> 40:19.594
She got injured
a week later
and had to quit.

40:19.594 --> 40:20.998
Really?

40:20.998 --> 40:21.895
She wasn't
very good in the first place.

40:21.895 --> 40:23.071
- No, she sucked.
Yeah.

40:23.071 --> 40:25.398
Yeah.

40:25.398 --> 40:27.207
Yeah, no, you're right.
That is a very cute story.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.670
Thanks.

40:33.478 --> 40:34.649
We're out of beer.

40:43.124 --> 40:44.593
Um...

41:09.854 --> 41:10.850
Come here.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.150
- Which one of us would you...

43:41.633 --> 43:42.699
Okay.

43:47.441 --> 43:48.645
I'm going to bed.

43:51.039 --> 43:52.605
What about your number?

43:52.605 --> 43:54.816
- I told you,
I'm not a homewrecker.
Please.

43:55.647 --> 43:57.954
Um...

43:57.954 --> 44:00.115
Okay, uh...

44:00.115 --> 44:01.918
I will be watching
your match tomorrow.

44:01.918 --> 44:03.789
Whoever wins
can have my number.

44:03.789 --> 44:05.321
All right.

44:06.826 --> 44:08.990
You can beat him,
you know that.

44:08.990 --> 44:10.499
You should
beat him actually.

44:10.499 --> 44:12.065
Are you saying
you want me to?

44:12.065 --> 44:14.061
I'm saying you're not going
to get my number if you don't.

44:14.061 --> 44:15.329
But what do you want?

44:15.329 --> 44:18.466
I want to watch
some good fucking tennis.

44:21.012 --> 44:22.008
Good night.

44:28.544 --> 44:30.343
Remember when you said
you'd let me win?

44:30.343 --> 44:32.115
That was
a lifetime ago.

44:32.115 --> 44:33.488
- What about my grandmother?
- Hope she has

44:33.488 --> 44:35.490
- a fucking stroke.

45:06.213 --> 45:08.219
- Wow.

45:11.887 --> 45:13.224
Thirty, forty.

45:15.694 --> 45:16.961
That's how you do it!

45:16.961 --> 45:20.099
Nice!
That's the way you play!

45:20.995 --> 45:21.936
Go!

45:42.687 --> 45:43.925
Thirty, love.

45:50.428 --> 45:52.230
Forty, love.
Come on, Art,
you got this!

45:52.230 --> 45:54.727
It's not over, Art!
Hang in there, Art!

45:56.139 --> 45:57.301
Fault!

46:09.277 --> 46:10.914
Game and first set, Zweig.

46:10.914 --> 46:14.054
Zweig leads one set to love.

47:05.602 --> 47:08.768
So stupid losing
to guys like this, Victor.

47:13.317 --> 47:14.846
Fucking idiot.

47:28.464 --> 47:29.459
Fuck.

47:44.505 --> 47:46.311
Nice match, Zweig.

47:48.418 --> 47:51.049
You too, Grosu.

47:51.049 --> 47:52.482
- Tough break.

47:58.350 --> 47:59.929
Calm, Victor.

48:15.772 --> 48:17.677
What are you doing
with your life?

48:17.677 --> 48:18.913
How did you get like this?

48:18.913 --> 48:21.913
You can't beat some
fucking loser like him?

48:21.913 --> 48:23.117
How can you call yourself...

48:37.132 --> 48:39.699
So, do you,
like, play at Wimbledon

48:39.699 --> 48:42.264
or the US Open or what?

48:42.264 --> 48:44.897
Yeah, sometimes.
When I qualify.

48:46.135 --> 48:47.871
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:47.871 --> 48:49.739
What does that mean?

48:49.739 --> 48:54.112
Well, those big tournaments
usually have spots
for 128 players.

48:54.112 --> 48:55.947
So if you're ranked
in the top 100,

48:55.947 --> 48:58.051
then you instantly get a spot,

48:58.051 --> 49:00.854
but everyone else has
to play a sort of, uh,

49:00.854 --> 49:02.547
tournament before
the tournament.

49:02.547 --> 49:04.624
- Okay.
- Some years I make it,

49:04.624 --> 49:06.554
some years I don't.

49:06.554 --> 49:08.622
But, um, if I win this thing
in New Rochelle,

49:08.622 --> 49:11.132
my ranking will be
high enough for the Open.

49:12.096 --> 49:13.230
So, you'll get a spot?

49:13.230 --> 49:16.236
I'll get a spot
in the qualifiers.

49:17.808 --> 49:20.009
- Oh, okay.

49:20.809 --> 49:22.506
I told you tennis is boring.

49:23.172 --> 49:24.778
No, really...

49:24.778 --> 49:26.743
It's, um, it's interesting.

49:26.743 --> 49:27.775
Excuse me.

49:29.313 --> 49:30.948
Can I get a tea
with some lemon?

49:30.948 --> 49:32.417
Coming right up.

49:37.587 --> 49:41.327
Uh, so, tell me
about real estate law.

49:43.327 --> 49:45.694
Uh, I don't know,
well, um...

49:46.669 --> 49:48.301
- My firm...
- Mm-hmm.

49:48.301 --> 49:50.973
Well, it's not my firm,
but the firm that I work for,

49:50.973 --> 49:52.971
we actually do something
called estate planning.

49:52.971 --> 49:54.671
Which is a little different.

49:54.671 --> 49:57.836
I used to do real estate law
with this firm in Hartsdale...

49:57.836 --> 49:59.277
which I don't know
if you know where that is

49:59.277 --> 50:00.342
- but it's just five minutes...
- Thank you.

50:00.342 --> 50:01.783
...down the road
if you're driving,

50:01.783 --> 50:03.178
but, um, yeah,
I left that firm.

50:03.178 --> 50:05.678
It was small. Anyway.

50:05.678 --> 50:09.185
- Um, I deal with trusts and...
- Trust.

50:09.185 --> 50:11.759
...uh, power of attorney...

50:11.759 --> 50:13.352
Go ask them about the beds.

50:13.352 --> 50:14.820
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

50:14.820 --> 50:16.429
Do you want us to wait
to FaceTime with Dad?

50:16.429 --> 50:18.667
No, no, it's okay.
Do you mind taking this
upstairs for me?

50:18.667 --> 50:19.967
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay. Love you.

50:19.967 --> 50:21.030
- We'll be right up.
- All right, honey.

50:21.030 --> 50:22.300
All right, see you.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.167
Anything that, you know,
you have to deal with

50:24.167 --> 50:27.043
when someone crosses over...

50:28.502 --> 50:31.206
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

50:31.206 --> 50:32.514
Are you... Are you okay?

50:32.514 --> 50:33.973
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

50:35.149 --> 50:37.515
Can you excuse me?
I just have to...

50:38.421 --> 50:39.418
Yeah.

50:47.392 --> 50:48.797
What the fuck
are you doing here?

50:48.797 --> 50:50.697
I'm playing
at the Challenger.

50:50.697 --> 50:52.296
Yeah, I know that.

50:52.296 --> 50:54.164
But you're not
staying here,
are you?

50:54.164 --> 50:56.632
No. Why are you staying here?

50:56.632 --> 50:58.833
I assumed you guys would
rent a villa or something.

50:59.708 --> 51:01.209
Lily likes hotels.

51:03.404 --> 51:04.873
Our daughter.

51:04.873 --> 51:06.575
Oh.

51:06.575 --> 51:08.245
Art can't see us together.
He already thinks

51:08.245 --> 51:09.910
I planned this
to humiliate him.

51:11.381 --> 51:13.716
- Didn't you?

51:14.459 --> 51:15.520
Not this part.

51:26.297 --> 51:27.896
Are you on a fucking date?

51:27.896 --> 51:29.199
No.

51:29.199 --> 51:31.107
Well, yeah, but it's not...

51:32.777 --> 51:34.209
I just need
a place to sleep.

51:35.205 --> 51:36.206
- What?
- Wow.

51:36.206 --> 51:37.579
Can't all stay at the Ritz.

51:37.579 --> 51:39.441
Mm. Okay, well.

51:39.441 --> 51:41.851
Can you seal the deal
and leave?

51:41.851 --> 51:43.517
You're on opposite sides
of the draw.

51:43.517 --> 51:46.879
You're not gonna
play each other unless
you're both in the final.

51:46.879 --> 51:48.552
I don't think we have
to worry about that.

51:48.552 --> 51:51.292
No, you typically fall apart
in the second round.

51:55.823 --> 51:57.028
Your mom looks good.

51:57.028 --> 51:58.893
I know she does, Patrick.

52:05.106 --> 52:06.401
Do me a favor.

52:06.401 --> 52:08.001
Stay the fuck
away from us.

52:21.153 --> 52:22.521
Sorry, that was a, uh...

52:23.857 --> 52:24.985
Uh, hey...

52:31.992 --> 52:33.331
<i>Junior training sessions</i>

52:33.331 --> 52:36.205
<i>will now take place
on court six.</i>

52:41.209 --> 52:42.439
<i>Will Coach Stevens</i>

52:42.439 --> 52:44.810
<i>please report to
the main office?</i>

52:44.810 --> 52:46.105
<i>Coach Stevens.</i>

52:47.479 --> 52:49.116
What do you mean
you won't say?

52:49.116 --> 52:51.012
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Since when?

52:51.012 --> 52:53.618
Since she told me
she'd stop seeing me
if I told anyone.

52:58.453 --> 52:59.690
And go!

53:00.955 --> 53:02.930
Yep, yep, good.
- All right.

53:04.465 --> 53:06.366
Right, but she had to know
that you were gonna talk to me.

53:06.366 --> 53:08.036
She didn't indicate that
there were any exceptions.

53:08.036 --> 53:11.038
All right, fine.
Then give me a signal.

53:11.038 --> 53:12.435
Isn't this hard
for you to hear?

53:12.435 --> 53:13.875
Like, wouldn't you
rather not?

53:13.875 --> 53:16.439
No. I'm very happy for you.

53:16.439 --> 53:18.043
I just don't wanna
feel left out.

53:21.851 --> 53:22.977
There you go!

53:26.251 --> 53:27.685
Okay, how about this?

53:27.685 --> 53:29.384
If the two of you
slept together,
do a normal serve.

53:29.384 --> 53:30.992
- Art.
- I'm not asking

53:30.992 --> 53:32.553
you to tell me.
I'm just saying,

53:32.553 --> 53:35.390
if you fucked,
serve like me.

53:35.390 --> 53:36.859
- Like you?
Yeah.

53:39.068 --> 53:41.232
You know you have
a tic, right?

53:41.232 --> 53:42.867
Before you throw the ball up

53:42.867 --> 53:44.933
you place it
in the exact center
of the neck of the racket.

53:53.612 --> 53:57.010
Okay, fine, yeah.
Do that.
If you fucked.

53:57.010 --> 53:58.417
I'm not telling you
anything, Art.

53:58.417 --> 54:00.454
You won't be
telling me anything.
Come on.

55:25.605 --> 55:27.901
- Everything okay?
- I'm okay, thank you.

55:27.901 --> 55:29.477
Excuse me, Tashi.
- No, it's okay.

55:37.847 --> 55:38.917
- Thank you.
Thank you.

55:38.917 --> 55:40.015
Of course.

55:46.186 --> 55:49.365
<i>Time. Second set.
Donaldson to serve.</i>

56:21.119 --> 56:22.827
There you go!

56:36.969 --> 56:39.479
He's pretty funny.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.216
He's, like,
always cracking jokes.

56:41.216 --> 56:43.017
It just sounds so hard.

56:43.017 --> 56:44.178
It's not.

56:45.588 --> 56:47.982
I don't know I feel,
like, out of all my classes...

56:47.982 --> 56:49.918
All right,
so when are you going pro?

56:49.918 --> 56:52.357
Um, well,
if we win the championship,

56:52.357 --> 56:54.691
- then I'll leave.
- So, May.

56:54.691 --> 56:57.590
- I said, if we win.
- Right. So, May.

56:57.590 --> 57:00.168
Um...

57:00.168 --> 57:01.502
Did Patrick tell you
he's coming

57:01.502 --> 57:04.371
- to the Pepperdine match?
- Hmm. Yeah, he told me.

57:04.371 --> 57:06.534
We should get dinner
or something.

57:06.534 --> 57:07.771
Sure. If you want.

57:10.979 --> 57:12.505
What's up?

57:12.505 --> 57:13.548
Nothing.

57:14.575 --> 57:15.649
Art.

57:18.049 --> 57:19.421
The whole thing you're doing,
you're not good at it.

57:19.421 --> 57:21.283
- It's fucking stupid.
- I'm not doing a thing.

57:21.283 --> 57:23.055
I'm just surprised that
you guys are
still seeing each other.

57:23.055 --> 57:23.921
That's all.

57:27.921 --> 57:29.091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

57:32.502 --> 57:34.668
Why did you ask me
to come to lunch with you?

57:35.767 --> 57:37.105
I told you,
I had extra meal credits

57:37.105 --> 57:38.403
and they were
going to expire.

57:38.403 --> 57:39.635
Don't be such
a fucking pussy.

57:39.635 --> 57:40.869
Is he seeing other girls
on tour?

57:40.869 --> 57:42.170
- No, I mean...
- Is that what this is?

57:43.343 --> 57:44.411
- I don't know.
- What?

57:44.411 --> 57:45.477
That's not what
I'm trying to say.

57:45.477 --> 57:46.845
Then what are you
trying to say?

57:50.252 --> 57:51.619
- Okay.

57:55.125 --> 57:56.448
He's not in love
with you.

58:06.132 --> 58:08.262
What makes you think
I want someone
to be in love with me?

58:09.372 --> 58:10.570
Did I ever say I was
in love with him?

58:10.570 --> 58:11.968
- You didn't.
- So why would I give a fuck

58:11.968 --> 58:13.568
- if he loved me or not?
- I guess you wouldn't.

58:13.568 --> 58:14.675
- Cool.
- Cool.

58:16.038 --> 58:17.135
Don't you think
you deserve it?

58:17.135 --> 58:18.413
Jesus fucking Christ.

58:18.413 --> 58:19.977
I mean,
who wouldn't be
in love with you?

58:25.216 --> 58:26.755
Think you might be
the worst friend in the world.

58:26.755 --> 58:27.912
Maybe.

58:27.912 --> 58:29.019
Definitely!

58:30.358 --> 58:32.693
Thank you.
For lunch, Art.

58:43.372 --> 58:45.340
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

58:45.340 --> 58:47.508
Who the fuck is this guy?

58:47.508 --> 58:49.337
- Does he go here?
I don't know.

58:49.337 --> 58:51.310
- I don't... I don't think so.
Come on, Donaldson,

58:51.310 --> 58:52.581
big serve! Big serve!

58:57.846 --> 58:58.881
That's right, baby!

58:58.881 --> 59:00.380
Show that motherfucker
who's boss.

59:02.886 --> 59:04.758
Finish it up, Donaldson,
come on.

59:11.826 --> 59:12.865
Whoa!

59:13.664 --> 59:14.735
All right.

59:17.240 --> 59:20.708
Come on. Come on. Come on.

59:24.276 --> 59:25.339
Art!

59:28.176 --> 59:29.215
Out of the way,
out of the way!

59:50.264 --> 59:51.706
So, how's the tour?

59:52.933 --> 59:54.038
No fun stuff?

59:54.736 --> 59:55.839
Like what?

59:55.839 --> 59:57.608
I don't know.
Are you seeing anybody?

59:57.608 --> 59:59.908
What do you mean?
I'm taken.

59:59.908 --> 01:00:01.045
What do you think
I'm doing here?

01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:09.053
You're not here
to visit me?

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.453
What?

01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:19.965
You're really committing
to this thing?

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:23.202
- To Tashi?
- Hmm.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.463
Yeah. I mean,

01:00:25.463 --> 01:00:27.500
we're taking it step by step,
but, you know...

01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:29.678
I like her.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.814
I think she'd make me
an honest man.

01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:40.249
- You don't believe me?
- No, I'm just...

01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:43.489
I'm not sure how
she's thinking
about all of this.

01:00:43.489 --> 01:00:44.792
I don't want you
to get hurt.

01:00:47.218 --> 01:00:48.820
You don't want me to get hurt?

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.863
Hmm.

01:00:53.162 --> 01:00:55.198
- Did she say something to you?
- No.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.968
I just got the impression
she's not thinking

01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:01.875
about this as
a serious relationship.

01:01:03.213 --> 01:01:04.642
You got that impression?

01:01:04.642 --> 01:01:06.114
From a conversation we had.

01:01:06.114 --> 01:01:08.046
- Huh!
- Hmm.

01:01:12.782 --> 01:01:14.289
You fucking snake.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:16.516
Honestly, I'm proud of you.

01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:19.088
- I'd be doing the same thing.
- I'm not doing anything.

01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:21.730
It's fine. It's exciting
to see you this way.

01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:24.130
It's what's been missing
from your tennis.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.425
What?

01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:29.702
It's nice to see you
lit up about something.

01:01:29.702 --> 01:01:31.168
Even if that something
is my girlfriend.

01:01:31.168 --> 01:01:32.766
That's what the two of you
are calling each other now?

01:01:32.766 --> 01:01:34.532
Hmm.

01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:36.338
You know this makes
it hotter for me, right?

01:01:37.513 --> 01:01:39.445
You sitting here
pining for her.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:40.614
I would never do anything

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.778
- to get in the way of you...
- I know.

01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:43.283
- ...and your girlfriend.
- I know.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.544
It's not your style.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.646
You're playing
percentage tennis.

01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:49.890
Waiting for me to fuck up.

01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.930
Come on,
walk me over there.

01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.732
I missed you.

01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:49.745
You have any idea
how lonely it is on tour?

01:02:49.745 --> 01:02:51.345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:51.345 --> 01:02:53.344
Is that why you haven't won
any challengers?

01:02:53.344 --> 01:02:55.219
I just told you I missed you.

01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:15.239
I watched
the Shinoda match online.

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:16.970
And you could've won,
but then you started tanking

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:18.308
in the third set.

01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:21.479
- Tashi, come on.
- What?

01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:22.609
Look at me.

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:25.577
When were you gonna
tell me about Art?

01:03:25.577 --> 01:03:27.416
Thought you knew
about that.

01:03:28.322 --> 01:03:29.517
I mean...

01:03:31.189 --> 01:03:33.625
I feel bad because
I know he's in pain,

01:03:33.625 --> 01:03:35.688
- but...
- Right, but?

01:03:37.293 --> 01:03:39.000
What? You're not
intimidated by him?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.959
No.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.230
- Really?
- No.

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.499
- Well, you should be.
- Uh-huh. Why?

01:03:46.168 --> 01:03:47.942
- Because he's smart.
- Yeah.

01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:50.943
- He's good looking.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:53.141
And he's really
fucking good at tennis.

01:03:53.141 --> 01:03:54.947
Oh, he's always
been very good.

01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.352
Yeah,
but he's gotten a lot better

01:03:57.352 --> 01:03:58.645
since he's been here.

01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:01.820
Are the two of us
still playing for your number?

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.057
- I thought I won.

01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:06.686
That's your problem.

01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:08.897
You always think you've won
before the match is over.

01:04:12.129 --> 01:04:13.561
Are we talking
about tennis?

01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:16.872
We're always
talking about tennis.

01:04:19.539 --> 01:04:20.667
Can we not?

01:04:27.348 --> 01:04:28.180
Sure.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.050
What are you doing?

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.614
I'm getting ready
for my match.

01:04:36.614 --> 01:04:39.026
Start my routine.
I'll see you there.

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.063
- Tashi.
- What?

01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:43.631
If you're not interested
in me fixing your game
for free,

01:04:43.631 --> 01:04:45.593
don't worry about it.
It's fine.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.627
Why do you care so much?

01:04:48.627 --> 01:04:50.168
Well, we're dating, right?
So, I don't know.

01:04:50.168 --> 01:04:51.835
Should be
a little embarrassing
if you suck.

01:04:51.835 --> 01:04:54.005
- I suck now?
- God.

01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:56.000
It's not college tennis
out there.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.580
We can't all walk around
calling ourselves
"The Duncanator."

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.140
- Wow.
- I'm sorry. I just...

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.311
Okay. No, it's fine.

01:05:03.311 --> 01:05:04.642
Look, I'm happy
they like you here.

01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:05.981
I just don't need you
to be my coach.

01:05:05.981 --> 01:05:07.417
Well, someone needs to be.

01:05:09.525 --> 01:05:10.757
Can we just start over?

01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:12.684
What do you think
you need from me?

01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:14.919
Honestly,
what do you think
you need from me?

01:05:14.919 --> 01:05:17.757
A cheerleader?
A girlfriend?
A fuck buddy?

01:05:17.757 --> 01:05:19.998
Like, there's plenty
of girls out here
that would

01:05:19.998 --> 01:05:21.896
love to be
your girlfriend, okay?

01:05:21.896 --> 01:05:23.600
You're charming.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.073
You're talented,
you got a big dick.
Just go be with one of them.

01:05:27.944 --> 01:05:29.909
Is this like,
a new strategy
you're using

01:05:29.909 --> 01:05:31.175
to pump yourself up
before the match?

01:05:31.175 --> 01:05:33.210
Have a little fight
to get the energy going?

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:35.407
I don't need a fight
to get the energy going.

01:05:35.407 --> 01:05:37.181
No. Just an hour
of meditation.

01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:39.249
And what?
You think that's lame?

01:05:39.249 --> 01:05:40.745
I think it's unnecessary
given you're playing

01:05:40.745 --> 01:05:43.014
Sally Fucking Country Club
from Pepperdine.

01:05:43.014 --> 01:05:45.917
And how's coasting
by on talent going for you?

01:05:48.664 --> 01:05:50.126
You know
how ridiculous it is

01:05:50.126 --> 01:05:51.960
to hear you
call me every week,

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.869
talking about all the ways
that you're getting
screwed over on tour?

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:56.962
As if that's a good use
for my fucking time?

01:05:56.962 --> 01:06:00.767
- Well, excuse me
for inconveniencing you.
- You are, actually.

01:06:00.767 --> 01:06:02.871
I need to be alone.
So can I just
meet you there?

01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:04.742
- No.
- What?

01:06:04.742 --> 01:06:07.048
I'm not going to the match.
Not if you think you can just
dismiss me.

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:09.245
I'm not some fucking lapdog
who's gonna sit around

01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:12.149
and let you punish me.
I'm not Art.

01:06:12.149 --> 01:06:13.880
Or maybe you need
someone like that.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.822
Someone who's
gonna hop on board
and be Mr. Tashi Duncan.

01:06:16.822 --> 01:06:18.087
Is that what
you think I want?

01:06:18.087 --> 01:06:20.754
Yeah. A member
of the fan club.

01:06:25.967 --> 01:06:27.530
You're not a member
of my fan club?

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.905
I'm your peer.
I'm not your fucking groupie.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.437
And I'm definitely
not your student.

01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:36.869
All right.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.313
Good luck, champ.

01:07:27.993 --> 01:07:29.629
Come on.
- Hi.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.024
- Sorry.
- Hi.

01:07:31.024 --> 01:07:32.067
Thank you.

01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:38.001
<i>And now, your 2002, 2005,</i>

01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:41.800
<i>and 2006 NCAA champion,</i>

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.039
<i>give it up for
Stanford Women's Tennis.</i>

01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:45.707
Go Stanford!

01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:47.577
Hey!

01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:51.449
Tashi!

01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:54.221
Tashi!

01:07:57.056 --> 01:07:59.688
Tashi! We love you, Tashi!

01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:06.464
Yeah, whoo!

01:08:07.801 --> 01:08:09.203
Tashi!

01:08:10.903 --> 01:08:12.140
Yeah, let's go!

01:08:27.389 --> 01:08:30.551
<i>On court one,
Maria Foster from Pepperdine,</i>

01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:33.219
<i>and from Stanford,
Tashi Duncan.</i>

01:08:40.727 --> 01:08:42.896
We love you, Tashi!

01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:49.935
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:09:57.576 --> 01:10:00.641
Okay, Tashi,
you're okay. You're okay.

01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:02.347
out of the way!

01:10:02.347 --> 01:10:04.982
On your back.
Okay, try to breathe.

01:10:04.982 --> 01:10:06.553
Okay, you're okay.

01:10:08.821 --> 01:10:10.753
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:12.755 --> 01:10:15.062
Look at me.
Tashi, look at me, okay?

01:10:15.062 --> 01:10:18.162
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
Breathe.

01:10:18.162 --> 01:10:19.828
It's torn up pretty bad,

01:10:19.828 --> 01:10:21.559
but we won't know for sure
until we get the X-rays

01:10:21.559 --> 01:10:22.695
from the hospital.

01:10:22.695 --> 01:10:24.170
Did you see it happen?

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:25.570
Yeah, it was pretty quick.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.568
Just a slip and then
she landed on it
the wrong way.

01:10:28.568 --> 01:10:30.236
That's all it takes.

01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:33.776
Yeah.
Let's just hope
it's not as bad as it looks.

01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:36.811
Did you get an ETA
on the ambulance?

01:10:36.811 --> 01:10:38.885
Yeah, they said
they're on their way.

01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.816
- I'm sorry.
- Out.

01:10:43.816 --> 01:10:45.522
- Listen, Tashi! Tashi...
- Get out! Out!

01:10:45.522 --> 01:10:46.995
- Tashi, Tashi, listen, please.
Out!

01:10:46.995 --> 01:10:48.923
- Out!
- Patrick, get the fuck out!

01:11:31.303 --> 01:11:32.939
- Out!

01:11:32.939 --> 01:11:34.037
Thirty, love.

01:11:34.037 --> 01:11:35.402
That was out!

01:11:35.402 --> 01:11:36.943
That was way out!

01:11:36.943 --> 01:11:39.079
The ball was called in.

01:11:39.079 --> 01:11:40.447
- Are you blind?
Zweig!

01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:42.247
Are you here to do your job,
or you're just excited

01:11:42.247 --> 01:11:43.914
that Art Donaldson's
over there?

01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:46.710
I'm going to give you
a code violation
if you don't stop this.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.121
Hey, Art!

01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:49.888
This lady wants
your autograph.

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:55.753
Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.

01:11:55.753 --> 01:11:57.629
Point penalty, Zweig.

01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:02.168
Come on, Patrick!
Just play the game.

01:12:02.168 --> 01:12:03.798
This how you wanna
get your points?

01:12:03.798 --> 01:12:06.335
- I'm ready to serve, Patrick.
- Yeah, I bet.

01:12:06.335 --> 01:12:07.507
Forty, love.

01:12:20.857 --> 01:12:22.555
Stop going easy on me.

01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:26.119
I'm not.

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:40.964
Hit the ball!
- Tashi--

01:12:40.964 --> 01:12:42.509
Actually fucking
hit the ball.

01:12:44.174 --> 01:12:45.171
Come on.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.417
You afraid you're
gonna hurt me?

01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:54.851
Pussy.

01:12:59.024 --> 01:13:00.021
Wait!

01:13:05.228 --> 01:13:06.500
Okay?

01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.003
And actually try to win.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.743
Please.

01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:42.331
Hey.
I'm fine.

01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:43.295
You okay?

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:47.805
I'm good.
I'm okay.

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:02.314
I'm fine.

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:04.382
I'm okay.

01:14:05.255 --> 01:14:06.285
I'm fine.

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:08.122
I'm okay.

01:14:09.899 --> 01:14:11.527
Come here.

01:14:11.527 --> 01:14:14.199
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:15:39.747 --> 01:15:40.918
More aggressive.

01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:46.517
Little higher.

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.596
More aggressive.

01:15:58.569 --> 01:16:00.003
Just invite her to serve.

01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:08.041
Oh, come on, you can
sleep in tomorrow, right?

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.911
Katerina's match
isn't until nighttime.

01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:11.352
No. Are you kidding?

01:16:11.352 --> 01:16:12.650
I wake her up early
to run drills.

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:14.049
Oh, she's lucky
to have you.

01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.015
You're getting
too much height

01:16:16.015 --> 01:16:17.682
- on your ball toss.
I am?

01:16:17.682 --> 01:16:19.823
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Whenever you guys
are ready.

01:16:19.823 --> 01:16:21.255
Thanks.
- You're a great spot server,

01:16:21.255 --> 01:16:24.392
but right now,
you're checking in
at like 129, 130.

01:16:24.392 --> 01:16:26.458
But I think with, like,
a few adjustments,
you'd get to 135.

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.933
But you should listen to Karl.
He is your coach.

01:16:31.933 --> 01:16:33.531
I'm just Katerina's
hitting partner.

01:16:35.305 --> 01:16:38.613
Maybe you wanna jump ship?
Come be my assistant coach?

01:16:39.741 --> 01:16:41.508
Oh, I get it.

01:16:41.508 --> 01:16:44.284
You want to work
with someone who has
a little bit more potential.

01:16:44.284 --> 01:16:46.082
No! No.
No, it's not that.

01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:48.216
I mean, you have plenty
of potential. It's just...

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:51.087
You think that would be
a good idea?

01:16:51.993 --> 01:16:52.924
Why not?

01:16:57.832 --> 01:17:00.126
- That was a long time ago.
- It was not that long ago.

01:17:00.126 --> 01:17:01.793
Well, it feels like
a long time ago.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.905
So, you're saying
you're not in love
with me anymore?

01:17:11.776 --> 01:17:13.612
I'm really
proud of you, Tashi.

01:17:13.612 --> 01:17:15.382
- I'm serious, I'm serious.
- Oh, God.

01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:17.080
- You're doing really well.
- Okay.

01:17:18.477 --> 01:17:20.245
What?
You think I was
going to, like,

01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:22.116
- kill myself
after the injury?
- No.

01:17:22.116 --> 01:17:23.988
No, I'm just glad
that you didn't quit tennis.

01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:28.087
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
my only skill in life

01:17:28.087 --> 01:17:29.458
is hitting a ball
with a racket.

01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:37.529
This is really stupid,
but, uh...

01:17:40.366 --> 01:17:41.973
After your injury...

01:17:44.038 --> 01:17:45.471
I couldn't help but just...

01:17:46.845 --> 01:17:49.282
think about what
would have happened

01:17:49.282 --> 01:17:51.180
if I had beaten Patrick.

01:17:53.119 --> 01:17:54.821
So you want me
to join your team
because you feel guilty?

01:17:56.057 --> 01:17:57.790
No.

01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.826
I want you to join my team
because I want to win.

01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:05.029
I think you'd beat him now
if you guys played.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:06.833
Don't you think?

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.737
Don't know.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:12.366
We, uh...

01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:17.442
haven't played professionally,
and don't keep in touch.

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:20.038
- What?

01:18:20.038 --> 01:18:21.078
Just...

01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:24.851
I was a homewrecker,
wasn't I?

01:18:31.556 --> 01:18:32.925
- Art.
- Yeah.

01:18:35.889 --> 01:18:38.392
You never really said
if you're still
in love with me or not.

01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.498
Who wouldn't be?

01:19:15.798 --> 01:19:16.903
What?

01:19:21.976 --> 01:19:25.241
I really wanna
kiss you right now.

01:19:27.712 --> 01:19:29.178
But I'm afraid if I try,

01:19:29.178 --> 01:19:31.445
you'll think I'm
the worst friend
in the world.

01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:43.897
To who?

01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:18.793
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

01:20:47.488 --> 01:20:49.356
Game and
second set, Donaldson.

01:20:49.356 --> 01:20:51.195
- Six-two. Match is tied.

01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:52.999
One set all.

01:20:55.735 --> 01:20:57.905
Code violation, racket abuse.

01:20:58.572 --> 01:21:00.534
Point penalty, Zweig.

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.444
Please, please.

01:21:08.548 --> 01:21:10.607
New balls, please.

01:21:22.493 --> 01:21:25.528
He's not bad. I've played him
at a few of these things.

01:21:25.528 --> 01:21:27.666
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be
prostituting yourself

01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:28.833
for a place
to sleep tonight?

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:32.700
I'm staying at
that girl's house.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.475
- Mm. Must be the love.
- Hey, come have
a cigarette with me.

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:37.177
I have to talk to you.

01:21:37.177 --> 01:21:40.343
Yeah, I don't smoke.
And I'm not talking to you.

01:22:00.296 --> 01:22:01.768
I'm going to propose
something to you.

01:22:01.768 --> 01:22:03.098
Can you blow it
away from me, please?

01:22:03.098 --> 01:22:06.706
Sorry. It's gonna
make you angry.

01:22:06.706 --> 01:22:08.536
It's gonna make you
very angry.

01:22:13.714 --> 01:22:15.246
I want you to be my coach.

01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:20.010
What?

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:23.785
Even if he wins the Open,
completes his
career Grand Slam,

01:22:23.785 --> 01:22:28.092
Art's still gonna retire
as someone
who's just really, really good.

01:22:28.092 --> 01:22:30.292
That's what you guys
will have done together.

01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:33.094
But imagine if you could turn
Patrick Zweig

01:22:33.094 --> 01:22:34.793
into a guy who wins a Slam.

01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:38.198
I still have a season.

01:22:38.198 --> 01:22:39.740
I still have
one good season,

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.503
and I need you
to bring it out of me.

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:46.145
So...

01:22:47.812 --> 01:22:48.906
what do you think?

01:22:50.147 --> 01:22:51.879
- How fucking dare you?

01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:52.984
Jesus Christ!

01:22:52.984 --> 01:22:54.547
You want my
best piece of advice?

01:22:54.547 --> 01:22:55.949
- Do you want me
to coach you?
- Yeah.

01:22:55.949 --> 01:22:57.825
Okay, quit.

01:22:57.825 --> 01:23:00.455
Quit right now.
Right the fuck now, quit.

01:23:00.455 --> 01:23:02.224
You know that when I'm good,
I'm one of the best

01:23:02.224 --> 01:23:03.457
- in the world.
- You are 271st best

01:23:03.457 --> 01:23:05.155
- in the fucking world.
- I still have a shot.

01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:07.432
You're 31.
You have a better shot
with a handgun in your mouth.

01:23:10.464 --> 01:23:12.764
I mean,
why don't you go home?

01:23:12.764 --> 01:23:15.066
Go home, ask your parents
for a seat on the board,

01:23:15.066 --> 01:23:17.744
or you know what,
matter of fact,
ask them for some money. Okay?

01:23:17.744 --> 01:23:19.311
Go be like
any other spoiled kid

01:23:19.311 --> 01:23:22.241
who has ever
amounted to nothing
in their fucking life,

01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:23.774
and stop this performance

01:23:23.774 --> 01:23:25.443
of being
a down-on-your-luck
professional.

01:23:25.443 --> 01:23:26.745
- Tashi...
- No, you're not

01:23:26.745 --> 01:23:28.682
20 years old anymore,
and it's not cute to be

01:23:28.682 --> 01:23:30.520
walking around pretending
like you need to grind it out

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.120
at these bum-fuck tournaments,
and sleep in your fucking car.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.589
And it is unforgivable

01:23:35.589 --> 01:23:37.860
that you would ask me
to devote a single second

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.625
of my fucking time

01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:41.359
to help you achieve
your fucking dreams.

01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:43.136
What dreams, Patrick?

01:23:43.802 --> 01:23:44.871
You never had any!

01:23:44.871 --> 01:23:46.135
Is that what
you and Art
are doing?

01:23:46.135 --> 01:23:47.035
- Living the dream?
- That is exactly

01:23:47.035 --> 01:23:48.499
what the fuck we're doing.

01:23:48.499 --> 01:23:50.077
Then how come
you hate him?

01:23:52.743 --> 01:23:54.213
You do.

01:23:55.584 --> 01:23:57.641
It's obvious, you do.

01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:58.985
You can feel him
giving up already,

01:23:58.985 --> 01:24:00.712
even though you know
he's not going to retire

01:24:00.712 --> 01:24:02.615
- until you let him.
- He is a grown man.

01:24:02.615 --> 01:24:04.155
- He can do
whatever he wants.
- Sure, sure,

01:24:04.155 --> 01:24:07.324
but he doesn't.
He does whatever
you want.

01:24:07.324 --> 01:24:10.290
Except now, he's not
even pretending to like it.

01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:12.731
- He's dreaming about

01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:15.002
eating hamburgers again.

01:24:15.002 --> 01:24:16.928
Watching your daughter, um...

01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:19.898
Uh, Lily, grow up.

01:24:19.898 --> 01:24:23.033
Maybe doing some commentary
on the Tennis Channel.

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.542
He's ready to be dead.

01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:29.807
And you're starting to realize

01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:31.250
you might not want
to be buried with him,

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:34.352
'cause who is he to you
if he's not playing tennis?

01:24:36.683 --> 01:24:38.521
So that's what
you think he is to me?

01:24:39.562 --> 01:24:41.051
A racket and a dick.

01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:50.698
Does Art know
about Atlanta?

01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:57.474
You keep saying you came here
because Art needed matches.

01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:01.038
I think you came
for something else.

01:25:08.579 --> 01:25:09.915
You think
I came here for you?

01:25:12.051 --> 01:25:15.261
You think I came here
to throw it all away for you?

01:25:16.623 --> 01:25:18.165
Maybe you just
wanted to see me.

01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:20.233
I have seen you.

01:25:21.769 --> 01:25:22.961
You look like shit.

01:25:25.905 --> 01:25:27.097
I'm going to beat him.

01:25:30.572 --> 01:25:32.245
If we both
make it to the final.

01:25:33.605 --> 01:25:35.573
I'm going to beat him.

01:25:35.573 --> 01:25:37.107
Even if you could beat him,

01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:39.813
it wouldn't change anything.

01:25:42.121 --> 01:25:44.223
It'll break him.
You know it will.

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:47.260
It won't make you. Okay?
It's too late for that.

01:25:53.827 --> 01:25:55.329
My number,
in case you
change your mind

01:25:55.329 --> 01:25:56.764
- about the coaching.
- I won't.

01:26:27.994 --> 01:26:29.593
Just text me.
I'll meet you by the car.

01:27:01.998 --> 01:27:02.863
Time.

01:27:10.835 --> 01:27:13.238
Final set.
Zweig to serve.

01:27:13.238 --> 01:27:14.713
Love, one.

01:27:16.074 --> 01:27:18.109
This is it!
Keep it up, champ.

01:27:20.756 --> 01:27:22.289
Come on, man!

01:27:24.422 --> 01:27:26.557
Let's go, let's go, Artie.

01:28:58.948 --> 01:29:01.278
Grab those!
Make sure
that tent is secure.

01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:15.369
Can you do me a favor?

01:29:17.635 --> 01:29:20.198
Can you not, like,
demolish me tomorrow?

01:29:23.602 --> 01:29:25.970
Hey, congrats on being

01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:27.678
a Phil's Tire Town
Challenger finalist.

01:29:28.817 --> 01:29:29.680
Yeah, you too.

01:29:31.178 --> 01:29:32.844
Hopefully,
the wind dies down
before tomorrow

01:29:32.844 --> 01:29:34.380
and we can have
a fair fight.

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.549
Yeah.

01:29:35.549 --> 01:29:39.949
Art. Come on.
Can we talk?

01:29:39.949 --> 01:29:41.793
Can you put
your dick away?

01:29:43.557 --> 01:29:44.860
This is a sauna.

01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:49.059
Look, we've been here
for a week
and we haven't said

01:29:49.059 --> 01:29:51.862
two words to each other.
It's just...

01:29:51.862 --> 01:29:54.572
It's silly, man,
it's dramatic.

01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:58.038
I mean, really,
why are you
so angry with me?

01:30:01.515 --> 01:30:03.747
Look, I don't buy
that it's because of Tashi,

01:30:03.747 --> 01:30:05.880
or I don't think it's because
of what happened to her.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.852
I think maybe you're still
just really disturbed

01:30:08.852 --> 01:30:12.255
by the fact that she could've
been into someone like me.

01:30:12.255 --> 01:30:14.021
When we were teenagers.

01:30:16.128 --> 01:30:17.123
Huh!

01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:22.165
When we were teenagers.

01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:24.200
<i>...which will be taking place
tomorrow evening.</i>

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.735
<i>He has really been</i>

01:30:25.735 --> 01:30:27.738
<i>in tip-top form this year,
hasn't he, Jason?</i>

01:30:27.738 --> 01:30:29.099
<i>Yeah,
it's actually pretty remarkable</i>

01:30:29.099 --> 01:30:30.909
<i>the difference
we've seen in his game.</i>

01:30:30.909 --> 01:30:33.906
<i>He's far and away
the favorite right now
to win the US Open.</i>

01:30:33.906 --> 01:30:35.612
<i>I completely agree.</i>

01:30:35.612 --> 01:30:37.049
<i>And then, of course,
on the women's side</i>

01:30:37.049 --> 01:30:38.374
<i>we have Anna Mueller,</i>

01:30:38.374 --> 01:30:40.047
<i>who's already got
the Wimbledon title this year.</i>

01:30:40.047 --> 01:30:41.881
<i>She's been having
a great season.</i>

01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:43.921
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.590
<i>There just hasn't been
really anyone
on the women's side</i>

01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.455
<i>who can give her
much of a challenge.</i>

01:30:48.455 --> 01:30:50.227
<i>In the case of Donaldson,
what do you think it is that...</i>

01:31:36.605 --> 01:31:37.808
It's his grandmother's.

01:31:41.344 --> 01:31:42.472
How is she?

01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:45.145
She died.

01:31:46.887 --> 01:31:47.851
Stroke.

01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:25.350
I miss you.

01:32:50.876 --> 01:32:52.712
You're right.

01:32:52.712 --> 01:32:54.186
I do find it disturbing.

01:32:54.186 --> 01:32:55.589
There's no need, man.

01:32:57.192 --> 01:32:58.588
Lots of girls were into me.

01:32:58.588 --> 01:33:00.923
None of them
wanted to marry me.

01:33:00.923 --> 01:33:03.058
- That's not what I was for.
- What were you for?

01:33:19.043 --> 01:33:20.204
<i>You're exactly right, Jason.</i>

01:33:20.204 --> 01:33:22.014
<i>Just to back you up
a little bit...</i>

01:33:22.014 --> 01:33:26.852
<i>His first serve last year
was around 130,
which is excellent.</i>

01:33:26.852 --> 01:33:31.615
<i>But now we're seeing him
get up to 135, 140 sometimes,</i>

01:33:31.615 --> 01:33:33.958
<i>it's giving him a lot more
free points when he serves.</i>

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.459
<i>Yeah, it's just
little things like that...</i>

01:33:36.459 --> 01:33:38.423
Art? Mr. Donaldson?

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:40.731
Oh, my God,
I can't believe my luck

01:33:40.731 --> 01:33:42.860
that I would run
into you so late at night.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:44.297
Um, would you, uh...

01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.432
Sure, yeah.

01:33:49.068 --> 01:33:50.067
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:33:50.067 --> 01:33:51.401
Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:53.207
<i>The edge
over the opponents.</i>

01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:55.775
<i>That's often the difference
between a good player</i>

01:33:55.775 --> 01:33:57.078
<i>and a great player.</i>

01:33:57.078 --> 01:33:59.618
<i>And I think
Donaldson right now is</i>

01:33:59.618 --> 01:34:01.315
<i>starting to look like
a great player.</i>

01:34:01.315 --> 01:34:03.215
<i>That's for sure.
And I'll be very surprised</i>

01:34:03.215 --> 01:34:04.887
<i>if he doesn't
come away tomorrow...</i>

01:34:04.887 --> 01:34:06.752
Honestly,
I thought you'd be happy

01:34:06.752 --> 01:34:08.321
I was in the draw.

01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:11.397
I mean, you always wanted
to beat me in a tournament,

01:34:11.397 --> 01:34:12.927
and a few weeks
before the Open,

01:34:12.927 --> 01:34:14.732
that's the perfect
confidence booster.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:16.668
I know what you're
trying to do right now.

01:34:16.668 --> 01:34:18.296
I'm not trying
to do anything, Art.

01:34:18.296 --> 01:34:20.432
This is a challenger.
I don't need to play

01:34:20.432 --> 01:34:22.506
- mind games with you.
- Right. You don't give a shit.

01:34:22.506 --> 01:34:24.535
I... Hey, I didn't say that.

01:34:26.845 --> 01:34:28.775
We both know you have
considerably more

01:34:28.775 --> 01:34:30.310
at stake here than I do.

01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:33.280
- Do I?

01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:39.459
What the...
Oh, fuck, where do get

01:34:39.459 --> 01:34:42.288
- your swagger from, man?

01:34:42.288 --> 01:34:44.663
I mean, you come in here
swinging your dick around

01:34:44.663 --> 01:34:47.159
like I'm supposed
to be afraid of it, but...

01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:49.467
Do you realize
how embarrassing it is

01:34:49.467 --> 01:34:51.835
that you are here
right now?

01:34:51.835 --> 01:34:53.866
Not quite as embarrassing
as you being here.

01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:55.467
I'm just stopping by, man.

01:34:56.508 --> 01:34:57.909
This is where you live.

01:35:02.215 --> 01:35:04.377
You know...

01:35:04.377 --> 01:35:08.116
I always tried to figure out
what happened to you,

01:35:08.116 --> 01:35:10.388
but, you know, the more
I've thought about it,

01:35:10.388 --> 01:35:12.491
the more I realize...

01:35:12.491 --> 01:35:14.486
It's what didn't happen.

01:35:15.262 --> 01:35:17.061
You never grew up.

01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:19.895
You still think
you can talk to me
like you're my peer,

01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:22.397
because we came
from the same place.

01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:25.266
But it's not about
where you come from
in tennis, Patrick.

01:35:26.406 --> 01:35:27.400
It's about winning.

01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:30.601
And I do. A lot.

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:37.048
- You've never beaten me.
- So what?

01:35:37.048 --> 01:35:40.380
I haven't beaten
most of the guys
who play at these things.

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.086
This is a game about winning
the points that matter.

01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:47.288
I don't matter?

01:35:51.732 --> 01:35:53.661
Not even to the most
obsessive tennis fan

01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:55.263
in the entire world.

01:35:58.638 --> 01:36:00.070
We're not talking
about tennis.

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:02.270
What the fuck else do I have
to talk to you about?

01:36:13.219 --> 01:36:15.987
I wanted to come in here
and wish you luck, Art.

01:36:21.725 --> 01:36:23.895
That makes no sense.

01:36:23.895 --> 01:36:25.964
I wanted to say that
I'm looking forward to it.

01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:29.429
And I miss playing with you.

01:36:33.965 --> 01:36:34.808
Yeah.

01:36:37.276 --> 01:36:39.041
Hmm.

01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:42.442
Well, I don't miss
playing with you, man.

01:36:43.483 --> 01:36:44.917
I'm too old for it.

01:36:53.922 --> 01:36:55.251
Kiss for me.

01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:57.120
Thank you. And Grandma.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.457
Mwah!

01:36:58.457 --> 01:36:59.896
Thanks, sweetheart
- Good night, honey.

01:36:59.896 --> 01:37:01.992
All right,
tuck you both in.

01:37:01.992 --> 01:37:03.898
Oh, there we go.

01:37:03.898 --> 01:37:05.696
Night, sweetheart.

01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:12.208
Good night.

01:37:14.105 --> 01:37:15.342
Thank you.

01:37:15.342 --> 01:37:16.848
What time you want me
to come get her tomorrow?

01:37:16.848 --> 01:37:19.441
I'm saying, whenever,
whenever you want to

01:37:19.441 --> 01:37:20.610
'cause she can
stay with Andrew

01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:22.150
- while we're doing warm-ups.
- Okay, hon.

01:37:22.150 --> 01:37:23.282
And you're talking
to Ralph in the morning?

01:37:23.282 --> 01:37:24.923
Oh, thank...
Yes, I do.
I have that.

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:27.254
- Okay. Thank you, Mom.
- Okay, sleep tight, okay?

01:37:27.254 --> 01:37:28.753
I love you.
- I love you, sweetie.

01:37:28.753 --> 01:37:30.463
- Have you... Do you have it?
Okay, got my key.

01:37:30.463 --> 01:37:32.088
- Yes, I do. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

01:37:32.088 --> 01:37:33.130
Good night.

01:38:26.444 --> 01:38:27.877
Tell me it doesn't matter.

01:38:33.223 --> 01:38:36.358
Tell me it doesn't matter
if I win tomorrow.

01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:41.528
No.

01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:48.271
You tell me if it matters.
You're the professional
competitor, Art.

01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:52.605
It can't be about
avoiding my judgment.

01:38:55.376 --> 01:38:56.774
I'm not a nun.
I'm not your mommy.

01:38:56.774 --> 01:38:59.046
I'm just asking
that you love me
no matter what.

01:38:59.046 --> 01:39:00.945
What am I, Jesus?

01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:02.054
Yeah.

01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:09.556
You can beat him.

01:39:11.729 --> 01:39:12.889
What if I don't?

01:39:14.393 --> 01:39:15.526
How are you
gonna look at me

01:39:15.526 --> 01:39:17.729
if I still can't beat
Patrick Zweig?

01:39:20.936 --> 01:39:22.107
Just like this.

01:39:34.349 --> 01:39:36.151
I'm going to
say something.

01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:37.815
It's probably gonna
make you angry.

01:39:40.355 --> 01:39:42.259
I need you to
hear me out, okay?

01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:50.795
I wanna retire this year
whether we win the Open or not.

01:39:54.497 --> 01:39:56.042
I'm still going to go for it.

01:39:58.470 --> 01:40:00.178
I'm still going to try, but...

01:40:03.978 --> 01:40:05.183
I'm tired.

01:40:10.190 --> 01:40:12.789
I don't want to be
one of those guys
who doesn't know

01:40:12.789 --> 01:40:14.487
when to walk away, okay?

01:40:14.487 --> 01:40:16.286
It's embarrassing
to still be doing this shit

01:40:16.286 --> 01:40:17.459
when you're 40.

01:40:22.303 --> 01:40:23.498
Okay.

01:40:25.735 --> 01:40:28.307
Okay?

01:40:28.307 --> 01:40:30.709
If you wanna
quit playing tennis,
you can quit playing tennis.

01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:32.705
You don't need
my permission.

01:40:57.332 --> 01:40:59.465
We've been
doing this together.

01:40:59.465 --> 01:41:01.401
We've always been
doing this together.

01:41:01.401 --> 01:41:03.502
I'm your coach.
Okay, I work for you.

01:41:03.502 --> 01:41:05.441
- Coach me then.
- I am coaching you.

01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:10.875
I'm playing
for both of us, Tashi.

01:41:12.244 --> 01:41:13.548
I know that.

01:41:21.721 --> 01:41:23.558
If you don't win tomorrow,
I'll leave you.

01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:30.670
I'm serious.
Does that help you?

01:43:35.395 --> 01:43:39.496
Can you just hold me
until I fall asleep, please?

01:43:48.432 --> 01:43:49.440
Okay.

01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:18.523
Advantage, Donaldson.

01:46:31.963 --> 01:46:34.173
Game, Donaldson.

01:46:34.173 --> 01:46:37.735
Donaldson leads
six games to five.

01:47:02.132 --> 01:47:05.568
<i>Phil's Tire Town reminds you
to drink some water.</i>

01:47:05.568 --> 01:47:08.034
<i>Beverages are available
at the snack bar.</i>

01:47:24.081 --> 01:47:25.380
What are you doing?

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.086
I told him
you're an Uber driver.
Just drive.

01:47:53.077 --> 01:47:54.476
I don't wanna be
parked here long.

01:47:54.476 --> 01:47:55.978
Someone's gonna think
I'm a hooker and call the cops.

01:47:55.978 --> 01:47:57.113
We can go back
to my hotel.

01:47:57.113 --> 01:47:58.213
The money just came in
this afternoon.

01:47:58.213 --> 01:47:59.881
I am not here
to fuck you, Patrick.

01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:00.991
- You're not?
- No.

01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:02.022
Uh.

01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:04.926
- Well?

01:48:09.994 --> 01:48:11.629
I want you
to lose tomorrow.

01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:13.000
I'm aware of that.

01:48:16.001 --> 01:48:18.434
I'm asking you
to lose tomorrow.

01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:27.652
Fuck off.

01:48:29.488 --> 01:48:31.815
He's doing really well
this week.

01:48:31.815 --> 01:48:32.918
He's ready to come back.

01:48:32.918 --> 01:48:34.184
He's ready to
make a shot at the Open,

01:48:34.184 --> 01:48:35.660
and if he wins tomorrow,
he'll know he can do it.

01:48:37.228 --> 01:48:38.129
He needs this.

01:48:38.129 --> 01:48:39.994
- He needs this?
- Yes.

01:48:41.794 --> 01:48:43.129
What about what I need?

01:48:45.462 --> 01:48:47.969
I can't believe
you'd do this to him.

01:48:48.842 --> 01:48:49.971
I mean,

01:48:51.168 --> 01:48:52.673
fucking me
would be one thing,

01:48:52.673 --> 01:48:54.809
but this?
This is unforgivable.

01:48:54.809 --> 01:48:56.379
Actually, I'm being
incredibly fucking kind

01:48:56.379 --> 01:48:57.881
to the both of you right now.

01:48:57.881 --> 01:49:00.553
Okay?
I'm taking such good care
of my little white boys.

01:49:02.056 --> 01:49:03.850
No. No fucking way.

01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:06.389
Drive me back
to my fucking hotel.

01:49:06.389 --> 01:49:07.891
Drive the fucking car, Patrick.

01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.187
Hey, you know what the most
frustrating part of this is?

01:49:09.187 --> 01:49:10.723
- What?
- You know what really
drives me crazy?

01:49:10.723 --> 01:49:11.723
You did come here to fuck me,

01:49:11.723 --> 01:49:13.322
but you're so full of shit

01:49:13.322 --> 01:49:15.198
that you won't
even admit that to yourself.

01:49:15.198 --> 01:49:17.229
If it's the only way
to get you to throw
the fucking match, then sure.

01:49:18.434 --> 01:49:20.071
Go fuck yourself.

01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:21.535
You absolute loser.

01:49:21.535 --> 01:49:22.902
I'm the loser?

01:49:22.902 --> 01:49:25.140
Yeah.
Yeah, you are.
Look at you.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.206
Time for your Uber driver
to drop you back off
to your family.

01:49:41.687 --> 01:49:42.595
Thirty, love.

01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:46.093
Come on, Art.

01:49:51.372 --> 01:49:53.903
- Unbelievable.
- I know. Let's go!

01:50:11.488 --> 01:50:12.658
Fuck it. I'll do it.

01:50:14.922 --> 01:50:16.087
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

01:50:16.087 --> 01:50:17.254
Because I want you
to actually do it,

01:50:17.254 --> 01:50:19.097
so I need to know
that you understand why--

01:50:19.097 --> 01:50:21.194
I'm not married to you, Tashi.
Just be happy
I'm doing what you want

01:50:21.194 --> 01:50:23.464
- and shut up about it.
- You are such a fucking child.

01:50:23.464 --> 01:50:25.132
Of course I am.

01:50:25.132 --> 01:50:27.904
I spent my entire life
hitting a ball with a racket.

01:50:29.508 --> 01:50:32.071
Why the fuck
am I in your car?

01:50:32.071 --> 01:50:33.536
- Because you're stupid.
- You're stupid.

01:50:33.536 --> 01:50:36.307
I know. I'm just not
as disturbed by it
as you are.

01:50:36.307 --> 01:50:38.713
I don't have nearly that
high an opinion of myself.

01:50:38.713 --> 01:50:40.310
You are the most
egotistical person

01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:42.587
- I have ever met in my life.
- Oh, sure, sure.

01:50:42.587 --> 01:50:44.081
But I've never been
confused about the fact

01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:45.785
- that I'm a piece of shit.

01:50:45.785 --> 01:50:46.886
That's what you like
about me.

01:50:46.886 --> 01:50:48.219
I don't like
anything about you.

01:50:48.219 --> 01:50:49.791
No, you like precisely
one thing about me

01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:51.091
and it's that
I'm such a piece of shit

01:50:51.091 --> 01:50:52.922
that I could actually see you
for what you are.

01:50:52.922 --> 01:50:54.166
And what is that?

01:50:54.166 --> 01:50:56.801
In reality? A really,

01:50:58.668 --> 01:51:00.496
really insanely hot woman.

01:51:00.496 --> 01:51:03.267
- Oh, fuck off.
- I guess now
you'd say a MILF.

01:51:03.267 --> 01:51:05.003
- Pull over.
- Come on, don't be dramatic.

01:51:05.003 --> 01:51:06.236
Pull the fucking
car over, Patrick.

01:51:06.236 --> 01:51:08.178
- Fine, let me... Fine.
- Pull over.

01:51:18.117 --> 01:51:21.186
Hey! Hey!
Your hotel's that way!

01:51:39.304 --> 01:51:41.406
Are you gonna
hit me again, huh?

01:55:06.513 --> 01:55:08.448
<i>I miss
watching you play, Tashi.</i>

01:55:09.918 --> 01:55:11.550
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:16.720
You have to make him feel
like he earned it tomorrow.

01:55:19.065 --> 01:55:21.395
You can't just give up
in the middle of the match.

01:55:24.595 --> 01:55:26.532
Are you sure
this is what you want?

01:55:30.367 --> 01:55:31.801
What else could I want?

01:55:41.417 --> 01:55:43.780
How am I supposed to know
if you're going to do it?

01:55:46.491 --> 01:55:47.652
You won't.

01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:04.540
All right.
Come on!

01:56:38.639 --> 01:56:40.672
Thirty, forty.

01:56:48.956 --> 01:56:50.880
All right.
Hang in there.

01:56:52.382 --> 01:56:53.520
Let's go!

01:56:55.725 --> 01:56:58.124
Yes, that's it, that's it!
Come on, Patrick.

01:56:58.124 --> 01:56:59.996
Yes, yes, the deuce!

01:56:59.996 --> 01:57:00.989
All right!
Yes!

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.118
Donaldson! Let's go!

01:57:24.118 --> 01:57:25.689
Blame it on the court!

01:57:25.689 --> 01:57:27.587
Whoo!

01:57:54.514 --> 01:57:56.179
Fault!

01:58:02.752 --> 01:58:04.228
Come on, get back in it.

01:58:07.359 --> 01:58:10.102
No! Zweig!

01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:23.148
Come on!
Whoo, whoo!

01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:57.743
Come on, Patrick, let's play!

01:59:32.876 --> 01:59:35.446
Time violation.
Warning, Zweig.

02:00:53.698 --> 02:00:54.831
Deuce!

02:01:32.268 --> 02:01:34.339
- Fuck off!

02:01:35.769 --> 02:01:38.238
Code violation,
audible obscenity.

02:01:38.238 --> 02:01:40.345
Point penalty, Donaldson.

02:01:41.409 --> 02:01:42.743
Advantage, Zweig.

02:02:12.810 --> 02:02:13.972
Art?

02:02:18.675 --> 02:02:20.044
He can serve.

02:02:20.977 --> 02:02:22.578
You need to
get into position.

02:02:26.126 --> 02:02:27.854
Come on, Art.
Let's go!
