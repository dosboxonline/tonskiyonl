Aw.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.510
Do you hear that?

02:16.427 --> 02:17.262
I mean, do you…

02:18.680 --> 02:22.809
That is the sweet, sweet sound
of no more karate wars.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.646
This is what happens
when you take down Terry Silver.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.691
When I did it back in '85,
we got, like, 30 years of peace.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.068
Well, here's to 30 more.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.029
Unless he finds a way
to get the charges dropped.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.990
Hey, hey. His reputation is ruined.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.908
No one's gonna fight
for that guy ever again.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.661
- Amanda, we are in the clear.
Hmm. Right.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.040
Unless you-know-who decides
to jump out of the shadows.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.668
Listen, if Kreese is dumb enough
to show his face around here,

02:48.751 --> 02:52.172
there's gonna be an army of US Marshals
waiting to take him back to prison.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.673
Amanda?

02:53.756 --> 02:54.799
We won.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.010
Let's enjoy it.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.638
With Sam applying to college
and Anthony starting high school,

03:01.306 --> 03:05.018
is now really the best time to be entering
the kids in a world karate tournament?

03:05.101 --> 03:09.564
Silver wanted to use the Sekai Taikai
to spread Cobra Kai worldwide.

03:09.647 --> 03:14.194
But now, if we win, kids around the world
are gonna wanna join Miyagi-Do.

03:14.277 --> 03:18.573
So karate is gonna be
a rest-of-our-lives kind of thing.

03:18.656 --> 03:23.077
Don't worry. After this tournament,
my full-time sensei days are over.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.040
- Oh.
This tournament is my karate swan song.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.168
And what better way to go out

03:30.251 --> 03:32.837
than by sharing
Mr. Miyagi's wisdom with the world.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.507
-
Eagle Fang's going global, boys.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.468
Once we win the Sekai Taikai,

03:38.551 --> 03:41.721
people are gonna be lining up
to put fangs on their backs.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.724
We're gonna need a second location,
hundreds of <i>gis</i>,

03:44.807 --> 03:47.352
a training room
with a couple of those ice baths.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.728
Isn't that a little aggressive?

03:48.811 --> 03:52.106
Hell, yeah. Gotta have ice in your veins
to take over the karate game.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.693
What does Mr. LaRusso think of this?
You're supposed to be going 50-50, right?

03:55.777 --> 03:58.863
If LaRusso wants to open up
a couple more dojos, he can be my guest.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.990
At the end of the day,
people are gonna have to decide

04:01.074 --> 04:04.327
if they wanna learn karate
from a car salesman or an actual sensei.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.792
Uh, I think you missed the turn.
Miyagi-Do is back that way.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.253
Nope. Gotta make sure
you guys don't go soft on me.

04:13.336 --> 04:17.090
We may be a combined dojo,
but we're Eagles where it counts.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.009
So before we go singing kumbaya
in Miyagi's backyard,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.053
we're headed to the warehouse
to break some bricks.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.723
- Can you give me another?
Yeah. More tape, it is.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.157
You don't need to have a dojo
to be a dojo, right?

04:47.662 --> 04:48.579
Right.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.710


05:00.341 --> 05:01.843
Hey, hey, hey, gang's all here.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.680
Oh, look,
it's Benedict Penis Breath.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.974
Come on. I said I'm sorry a billion times.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.476
I swear, no more heel turns.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.648
Pretty sweet, right?
I got, like, 30 of these.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.318
You have to buy in bulk
if you wanna make sense of the pricing.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.489
You got an XL?

05:24.949 --> 05:25.825
You know I do.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.704
Come here, man.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.128
I feel bad for sensei.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.213
He really loved that dojo.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.175
Yeah. At least Miyagi-Do
is alive and well.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.968
We don't have to deal
with Cobra Kai anymore,

05:44.052 --> 05:46.596
and now we're all one big karate family.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.058
Yeah.

05:53.895 --> 05:54.896
Well, most of us.

05:56.356 --> 06:01.402
Look, it took a while for you and me
to figure our shit out, but… we got there.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.740
Sam and Tory only recently
stopped hating each other.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.909
Hopefully, they'll be friends someday.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.245
Maybe we just need
to do something to jumpstart it.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.375
Great. Why don't you
take half the students,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.377
bring 'em out on the sparring deck?
You can--

06:19.712 --> 06:20.630
You have a hose?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.508
Decent chance
someone took a leak on this stuff.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.301
Why are you bringing that here?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.847
It's all that's left
of my demolished dojo.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.600
Oh, Johnny, I'm sorry.

06:33.851 --> 06:38.231
Anyway, got any lighter fluid? I came up
with a new lesson on the drive over.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.567
I call it
"Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire."

06:42.193 --> 06:43.653
So I'm gonna need a frying pan too.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.656
No. Today is <i>my </i>lesson.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.075
- What? I thought it was my day.
- Yep, it was.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.286
But Chozen came up with an exercise
that'll bring the new students up to speed

06:52.370 --> 06:54.747
and I thought
we could just do yours tomorrow.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.375
Maybe after you run it by me first.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.629
- Since when do I run shit by you?
<i>- </i>Since it might burn down the house.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.634
Uh, Sensei, Sensei, Sensei.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.010
We'll start in a minute, guys.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.806
Actually, um, we've got something
we wanna show you before training.

07:14.392 --> 07:18.104
It's been a long road,
but we're finally all on the same side.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.897
And as a reward?

07:19.981 --> 07:22.024
The toughest test
any of us have ever had to face.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.528
The Sekai Taikai is
the most prestigious karate tournament

07:25.611 --> 07:27.321
in modern martial arts history.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.322
For over a century,

07:28.406 --> 07:31.325
fighters from across the globe
have gathered every two years

07:31.409 --> 07:33.536
to compete for the title of World's Best.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.497
If the All Valley is March Madness,
this is the Olympics,

07:36.581 --> 07:40.126
plus the gladiator games and the kumite
from <i>Bloodsport </i>all rolled into one.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.086
- Yeah.
- If we win--

07:42.170 --> 07:43.796
Excuse me.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.465
When we win,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.384
the spoils will be life-changing.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.887
But it's gonna take
all of our focus

07:50.970 --> 07:53.222
and all the wisdom
our senseis have to offer.

07:53.306 --> 07:57.935
Yes, which is why we decided to take
at least one thing off your plates.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.354
- Coming up with our new dojo name.
- Yes!

08:00.438 --> 08:04.025
After some spirited brainstorming
and ad hoc focus-grouping,

08:04.108 --> 08:06.986
and also a dojo-wide vote,
we have a winner.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.615
We give you…

08:11.824 --> 08:13.993
Miyagi Fang Karate!

08:19.957 --> 08:21.667
We're not using that logo.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.504
Mr. Miyagi was the most generous
and honorable man I ever knew.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.674
I'm not gonna stain his legacy
by turning him into some karate vampire.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.636
All right. Don't give yourself a hernia.
There's gotta be some compromise.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.222
How about, uh, Eagle-Do Fang?

08:34.305 --> 08:37.642
Come on, Johnny.
Your compromise is just your dojo name.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.976
It's got your "Do" in there.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.436
Enough!

08:41.020 --> 08:42.355
No compromise.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.067
Miyagi-Do has honor, tradition.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.237
Eagle Fang has beak with teeth

08:49.320 --> 08:51.197
and no place to train.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.865
Miyagi-Do is the only choice.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.660
Says who, Toguchi? You haven't been here
long enough to get a vote.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.456
Been here long enough to fight Silver.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.708
You fought one guy while I took on five.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.211
My one guy had a Samurai sword.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.880
So did one of my guys.
You don't hear me bitching about it.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.550
All right, come on. The two of you
fighting isn't gonna solve this.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.219
Fight is exactly how we solve this.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.139
You, me, on the mat.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.684
Winner will name dojo.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.437
Or have I not been here long enough
to kick your ass?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.814
No one is fighting.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.150
- Okay? We need to focus on the kids.
- Kids will never find out.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.612
You wanna dance with the eagle, Toguchi?
Cue the music.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.864
It will not be easy listening.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.117
What's it gonna be,
flutes and wind chimes and shit?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.828
Monday, dawn, sparring deck.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.288
I be there.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.373
I be there too.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.758
It's all in the legs.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.262
Yeah, well, congrats
on your rather average leg strength, sir.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.723
All right, who's next?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
I'm good.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.268
Me too.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.814
Okay. What about the, uh, batting cages?
I heard there's a new fast pitch.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.317
Sure.

10:11.068 --> 10:11.986
Sounds fun.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.366
For some reason,
I don't think it sounds fun.

10:18.743 --> 10:23.706
It's a double date with my ex and yours,
who's also kind of my nemesis.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.833
So how'd you think it was gonna go?

10:25.916 --> 10:28.044
I didn't think she was your enemy anymore.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.173
I don't know what we are,
but… we're not double-daters.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.091
Whose idea was this?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.177
It was Miguel's idea.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.554
He thought it might help you guys
stop avoiding each other.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.306
I'm not avoiding her.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.309
Okay, fine.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.645
We've been enemies since the day we met.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.521
Now I'm training in her dad's backyard,

10:47.605 --> 10:50.900
learning the exact opposite of everything
I've ever been taught. It's weird.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.778
I'm not even sure
if she even wants to learn Miyagi-Do

10:53.861 --> 10:56.197
or if it's just a way
to get to the Sekai Taikai.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.367
Just give her some time, okay?
She'll come around.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.701
Just give her a chance.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.497
I mean, things are gonna be different
from now on, so…

11:11.420 --> 11:12.588
He's still not talking to you?

11:14.090 --> 11:14.924
No.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.884
I've gotta give it another shot.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.929
He needs to know there's another way
besides the shit Silver was feeding him.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.808
At least here,
he can't send my call to voicemail.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.980
I'm gonna be right back.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.945
This the biggest axe you got?

11:36.028 --> 11:39.740
May I assume you're not gonna use it
on human flesh and bone?

11:39.824 --> 11:43.285
Relax. If I wanted to kill someone,
all I need is this.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.372
That'll make me sleep better.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.332
Let me see what else I have.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.880
What the hell are you doing here?

11:55.589 --> 11:58.676
Nice to see you too.
Carmen told me where you went.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.263
Uh, whoa. Do I wanna know what that's for?

12:02.346 --> 12:05.891
Training. <i>Rocky IV </i>style. Gonna chop down
a tree, carry it through the snow.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.103
All right, no snow, but you get the point.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.939
Okay, what if instead of that,

12:12.022 --> 12:14.734
you, uh, called off the fight?

12:14.817 --> 12:15.735
No chance.

12:15.818 --> 12:20.698
Look, Chozen crossed the line, but it was
in the heat of battle. He didn't mean it.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.450
So we're Eagle Fang, then?

12:22.533 --> 12:26.036
Johnny, come on. Our strength
is we teach both styles equally.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.456
Let's not jeopardize that balance, man.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.333
Right, 'cause nothing
says balance like two against one.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.334
It's…

12:32.918 --> 12:37.006
When Kreese stole Cobra Kai from me,
I had to build Eagle Fang from scratch.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.759
But I made it a real dojo.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.554
Took us to the All Valley,
helped us earn a spot in the Sekai Taikai.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.723
It's not just a name.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.184
It's what it represents.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.686
This one big enough for you?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.605
Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.944
If Toguchi beats me, fine.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.239
After all I put into Eagle Fang,
I'm not giving up without a fight.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.575
You want someone to back out, talk to him.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.708
Always the bright spot of my day.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.919
He a friend of yours?

13:15.753 --> 13:17.087
I guess.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
Well, he's short.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.008
Yeah. I know.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.269
<i>Welcome to Coyote Creek.</i>

13:32.353 --> 13:33.896
Finish him.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.526
- That's not how I taught you to fight.
- It's what Sensei Kreese taught us.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.297
Ooh.

14:04.385 --> 14:07.137
So, I mean, it's our senior year, right?

14:07.221 --> 14:09.265
College right around the corner.
Kinda crazy.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.350
Yeah, I mean,

14:11.433 --> 14:14.728
it does feel just like yesterday
that we were dissecting fetal pigs,

14:15.437 --> 14:19.108
and now we're planning our futures
between training every day.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.944
There are just so many
good schools to choose from.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.406
I… I'm just a little overwhelmed,
if I'm being honest.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.701
It'll be easier
once you've heard back from Stanford.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.911
Fingers crossed.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.914
What about you, Tory?

14:35.541 --> 14:39.712
It's kinda hard to get in anywhere
when you spent almost a year on probation.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.423
Right.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.133
Um…

14:50.014 --> 14:52.641
Whoa, I give up. I give up.
Don't shoot. Don't do it.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.274
Kenny.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.360
Look, I know how hard
this has been on you.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.280
I know it's partly my fault since
I'm the one who made you join Cobra Kai.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.491
As soon as I figured out we were
on the wrong side, I tried to get you out.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.451
Ken--

15:12.244 --> 15:13.454
Hang on, man.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.414
Hang on, please.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.707
There's still time

15:16.790 --> 15:19.043
to let all that old shit go
and join our dojo.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.337
You earned a spot at the Sekai Taikai.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.673
The only way to claim it is with us.
I really think with the right mentors--

15:24.757 --> 15:26.592
He doesn't need your mentors.

15:28.093 --> 15:28.969
Shawn.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.432
You're out. Look, I don't…
I don't know what you heard, but--

15:33.515 --> 15:34.391
I heard enough.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.436
How you brought my little brother
into your karate cult

15:37.519 --> 15:39.563
and then left him there, alone.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.690
I made some mistakes.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.319
- I'm trying to make it up to him now.
- You had your shot.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.780
Now you're gonna leave him be.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.033
Otherwise, me and you
are gonna have a problem. Got it?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.459
You know that guy?

16:01.210 --> 16:04.213
It's Kenny's brother. Met in juvie.

16:05.589 --> 16:09.176
- He told me to leave Kenny alone.
- You're not gonna listen to him, right?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.638
Do whatever you need to do.
We'll have your back.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.645
Okay. We're there for you, man.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.033
Well, that looks… painful.

16:33.575 --> 16:37.162
Strengthen body.
Strengthen resolve.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.040
Well, I'd never doubt either.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.877
I was just hoping maybe we could resolve
this thing with Johnny another way.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.587
Do not worry, Daniel-san.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.798
I will not lose.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.258
I'm not worried you'd lose.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.345
Chozen, I'm worried this is gonna
drive a wedge in our partnership,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.347
and the kids are gonna be
worse off for it.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.101
Look, Johnny's always gonna be Johnny.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.147
I just don't get
why you've been so dug in lately.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.109
You been drinking again?

17:08.944 --> 17:10.112
No more drink.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.072
Dulls senses.

17:12.156 --> 17:16.201
- Cost me fight against Silver.
- Is that what this is about?

17:16.285 --> 17:18.537
Because you showed mercy,
and that monster took advantage?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.914
- That's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.585
Showing mercy is not a weakness.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.545
I agree. But still,

17:27.463 --> 17:29.673
it left you with 80 stitches in your back.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.511
Maybe you could use a break.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
I mean, take a trip back to Okinawa
for a week.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.143
Nothing for me in Okinawa.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.438
What do you mean?
I mean, you got your dojo. Kumiko.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.150
No.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.444
No Kumiko.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.905
That night,

17:52.988 --> 17:54.656
I called Kumiko.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.159
Drunk.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.911
Leave message.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.289
Pour my heart out.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.044
No call back.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.796
Oh, Chozen, I'm sorry.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.256
There must be some explanation for that.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.343
Explanation is clear.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.930
She does not feel same.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.475
Well, I can tell you that fighting Johnny
is not gonna make it any better.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.518
No.

18:24.061 --> 18:28.107
But it will ensure legacy of Miyagi-Do.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.027
That is all I have left.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.837
Pain does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.755
No, Sensei!

18:51.839 --> 18:55.968
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

18:56.051 --> 18:57.261
No, Sensei!

19:00.472 --> 19:02.182
What do we study here?

19:02.266 --> 19:03.934
The way of the fist, sir!

19:04.017 --> 19:06.103
And what is that way?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.897
- What the hell?
- Strike first and hard. No mercy!

19:08.981 --> 19:10.858
I can't hear you.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.570
- Stingray?
- Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy, sir!

19:14.653 --> 19:16.864
- What the hell is this?
- Arianna.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.199
- Yes, Sensei.
- <i>We do not train--</i>

19:19.283 --> 19:21.034
Class, we have a visitor.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.329
I've always wanted to say that.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.415
What the hell's going on, man?

19:26.498 --> 19:30.043
What's going on here is that Colin
and Sasha are doing a heck of a job.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.045
- I--
- Michelle, not now.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.672
Taylor, tie your shoes.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.966
- Yes, Sensei.
- Braden, your mom never called.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.468
A little Bertie…

19:39.261 --> 19:40.137
Bertie, Bert…

19:40.220 --> 19:44.474
Bert told me that you and Mr. LaRusso were
having some big tiff over a dojo name.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.978
So I thought
I'd just show you the solution.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.189
Oh, you running a daycare center?

19:50.272 --> 19:51.106
No.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.983
The solution is you

19:53.901 --> 19:55.569
taking back Cobra Kai.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.543
All right, man. Maybe you're getting
a little too old for this place.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.171
Hey, tell you what.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.216
Next weekend, we hit the strip club.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.220
- You crazy. Come on, man.
- There he is.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.431
Got room for one more?

20:29.603 --> 20:33.106
I heard what you said.
I just need one minute. Please.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.441
Back off, Keene.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.277
Shawn, you know where this is gonna end.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.113
He holds onto this anger,
it's gonna boil over.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.659
- You want him to end up where we did?
- Not your concern.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.661
You understand?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.501
Know what? I'm not sure I do.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.973
The last time we fought, I struck first.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.058
That's not me anymore.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.811
I don't wanna fight.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.354
Shawn.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.982
Let's just go. Come on.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.236
Nah. This'll only take a minute.

21:21.738 --> 21:22.572
Hey!

21:32.833 --> 21:35.168
You heard. We don't wanna fight.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.437
Really?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.150
Out of my way, Nichols.
I don't wanna hit a girl.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.401
That's sweet.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.320
But don't worry.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.030
You won't.

22:13.707 --> 22:17.753
Kenny, you have a place at our dojo.
Everyone has a home at Miyagi-Do.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.339
- It doesn't matter what happened.
- It matters to me.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.345
We're just trying to help you.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.156
That's it, little bro. Let's go.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.991
What? No, no, I'm not going anywhere.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.659
Yes, you are.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.161
Security's coming.

22:52.162 --> 22:52.996
We're done.

23:02.005 --> 23:02.839
Well,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.008
that could have gone better.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.595
- Could have gone worse.
- You picked up Miyagi-Do pretty fast.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.394
Yeah, well, I fought you enough.
I guess some of it must have rubbed off.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.024
Where did all these kids come from?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.317
Oh, yeah.

23:22.401 --> 23:27.280
All I had to do
was wallpaper West Valley Elementary.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.911
Oh, the photo. Yeah. Sorry.
I pulled that from your Facebook page.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.204
Hope you don't mind.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.706
I nearly got myself killed
taking down Cobra Kai.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.333
Why would I bring it back?

23:40.085 --> 23:41.086
Because it's awesome.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.464
Or at least it was
when you were in charge.

23:44.548 --> 23:48.093
Come on, man. I thought you and I
could build up the next gen, you know?

23:48.176 --> 23:51.054
I know they don't look like much,
but it's a good crop. Good prospects.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.765
That kid Braden over there, aka Snots.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.309
Booger. I can't call him that.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.394
His mom emailed me

23:57.477 --> 24:00.730
and said that <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>
is apparently "problematic,"

24:00.814 --> 24:02.357
and it didn't "age well."

24:02.441 --> 24:06.069
All right, look.
Do what you want. Call it what you want.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.447
But I'm out.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.991
I got a fight to train for.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.036
Hey, uh, when did Johnny Lawrence

24:16.455 --> 24:17.956
become such a pussy?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.667
Sensei!

24:20.750 --> 24:23.420
Sorry. Swear jar, I know.
I owe these kids, like, 40 bucks.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.379
What did you call me?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.340
What? Oh, hey. No. I… I didn't mean it. I…

24:27.841 --> 24:29.009
I kind of did mean it.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.471
'Cause it takes a pussy to walk away.
It takes a man to stay.

24:32.554 --> 24:36.099
And I know that Cobra Kai,
its stock is at, like, an all-time low.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.977
But if you're back at the helm,
if you're in the throne chair,

24:39.060 --> 24:40.896
the students are gonna come, man.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.608
I mean, you're, like,
the whole reason I joined the dojo.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.902
I know what you thought of me back then.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.779
Probably what most people think of me
when they meet me.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.616
But you didn't kick me out.
You let me stay.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.660
And you taught me so much, man.

24:56.536 --> 25:00.415
It got to the point
where I… I started to like myself.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.376
I could look in the mirror.
I could put my chest out.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.879
Like, I… I respected myself.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.050
I… I get that that sounds corny. Right?

25:10.133 --> 25:11.051
No.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.720
Maybe a little.

25:13.803 --> 25:17.265
Okay, but that's what you do
better than any other sensei around.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.019
We still have a spot for Cobra Kai
at the Sekai Taikai.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.230
With all due respect to Mr. LaRusso…

25:23.313 --> 25:25.690
And his smoking hot wife,
by the way. Good God!

25:25.774 --> 25:29.861
…but they can't bring anything
to the table that you don't already know.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.364
You're the sensei, not the student.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.950
He's a car lot guy.
You're Johnny Lawrence!

25:35.742 --> 25:39.913
To win this thing, it's gonna take
a badass dojo and a badass sensei.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.623
And when you win,

25:42.707 --> 25:44.501
you won't have to share it
with anybody else.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.920
But hey, I get why
you joined up with them at first.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.422
It's a means to an end.
Yada, yada, yada. I get it.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.882
But that's their legacy.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.384
Cobra Kai,

25:53.134 --> 25:54.886
that's your legacy, man.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.984
Surprised you got
any gas left in the tank after that.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.443
I'm tired as shit.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.237
Plenty more where that came from.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.698
Yeah, I bet.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.369
Didn't realize you had that kind
of scrap in you though. You got good.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.581
But you still couldn't
get past those girls.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.875
Those guys are all assholes.

26:25.959 --> 26:29.254
Didn't seem like it. They had
open shots but wouldn't take 'em.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.755
Same with Robby and his boy.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.674
What's that tell you?

26:32.757 --> 26:34.092
That they're pussies too?

26:35.885 --> 26:39.764
Okay. We both know that's not true.
And since when do you talk like that?

26:40.557 --> 26:43.393
- Since I learned what the world was like.
- Oh yeah?

26:44.185 --> 26:46.730
And who taught you that?
The ponytail dude they arrested?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.649
He teach you
all that aggro bullshit I saw too?

26:49.733 --> 26:54.654
Not bullshit. It's the way of the fist.
Strike first, strike hard, no mercy.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.950
That has got to be
the dumbest shit I've ever heard.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.579
Maybe whatever karate those guys do
would be good for you.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.957
No, I don't need them.
Gotta listen to my own instincts.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.626
Where's that gotten you lately?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.337
I saw that look in your eyes, K.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.964
I know that look.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.176
It's the same one that landed me in juvie.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.678
You keep going down this road,
that's where you'll end up too.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.432
Or you can learn from my mistakes.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.685
Maybe give Keene another shot too.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.648
You're becoming a man now, okay?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.859
It's time for you to decide
the kind of man that you wanna be.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.446
The kind of man you want Dad
to come home to after his tour.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.994
I don't know who I wanna be, man.

27:44.245 --> 27:47.707
I don't know even who…
I don't even know who I am anymore.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.085
Hey. It's okay, man.

27:52.629 --> 27:53.505
I got you.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.385
We'll figure it out.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.266
Hey. How'd it go
with the pistols-at-dawn duo?

28:05.350 --> 28:06.518
Oh, great.

28:06.601 --> 28:10.063
Both Johnny and Chozen listened to reason
and came to a mature decision.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.856
Oh. That bad, huh?

28:12.607 --> 28:15.985
Maybe you're right.
We should just quit while we're ahead.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.906
We only entered the Sekai Taikai
to stop Silver.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.200
With him gone, what if the pressure
of another tournament

28:22.283 --> 28:24.077
just makes us turn on each other?

28:26.371 --> 28:27.664
Hey, sweetheart.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.332
Hey.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.710
Hey. How was Golf 'N Stuff?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.420
Uh, hit-and-miss.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.130
But here's the twist.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.591
Tory and I actually crossed a bridge
I thought had been burned.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.137
I won't bore you with the details.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.098
Let's just say
that we found some common ground,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.225
and the world better watch out

28:47.308 --> 28:50.854
because now we have two bonsai badasses
ready to kick the competition.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.068
Well, that's a pleasant surprise.

28:57.152 --> 29:01.030
Yeah, and a counterargument
for dropping out of the tournament.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.074
Right.

29:06.035 --> 29:09.122
If those two can get along…

29:28.391 --> 29:31.728
Daniel-san, if you came here
to try and change my mind again--

29:31.811 --> 29:33.021
I haven't.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.774
I'm here to tell you I've changed mine.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.447
I think we have to
let Johnny win this one.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.576
You… you want me to lose fight?

29:46.659 --> 29:48.536
No. I'm saying the fight isn't necessary.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.665
Mr. Miyagi never cared
about tournaments or his legacy.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.835
He cared about teaching karate
the right way.

29:56.753 --> 30:01.257
And we can honor that under any name,
even Eagle Fang.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.760
But Eagle Fang name is stupid.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.803
It doesn't matter.

30:04.886 --> 30:08.306
This is about going to the Sekai Taikai
under a unified banner

30:08.389 --> 30:10.099
without us having a fight over it.

30:11.726 --> 30:14.437
Do you think
we could live with that?

30:17.941 --> 30:18.817
<i>Hai.</i>

30:19.776 --> 30:20.652
Can live.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.364
Ah, should have known, LaRusso.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.492
What? Are you here to ref,
make sure your guy wins?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.120
Relax. I'm just busting your balls.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.457
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kick your ass either.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.502
I concede.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.297
You… What, you're backing down?

30:41.381 --> 30:43.508
No, I'm conceding. There's a difference.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.010
Look, I've thought a lot about it.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.597
At the end of the day, Eagle Fang
is just another version of Cobra Kai.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.100
Cobra Kai is John Kreese's legacy.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.061
I don't want anything
to do with that asshole ever again.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.857
Plus, working with you guys
has made me a better sensei.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.652
It's made my students stronger.
Our students.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.155
So I don't wanna just teach
offense only anymore.

31:06.239 --> 31:09.367
I wanna do whatever it takes
to help lead Miyagi-Do to victory.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.829
Let's make sure
it's your sensei's legacy that lives on.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.543
Miyagi-Do's lucky to have you, Johnny.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.472
All right. I'm just personally glad
you guys aren't gonna fight.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.183
What do you mean? We're still fighting.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.435
Wait. What? Why?

31:36.227 --> 31:37.103
Why not?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.899
Why not?

31:40.982 --> 31:42.984
Face me. Bow.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.987
Face each other. Bow.

31:47.947 --> 31:48.781
Ready?

31:48.865 --> 31:51.534
<i>We've been through a lot</i>
<i>to get to this point.</i>

31:52.243 --> 31:54.787
<i>And we're finally on the same page.</i>

31:56.748 --> 31:58.833
<i>We've put aside old rivalries.</i>

32:01.377 --> 32:03.296
<i>And wiped the slate clean.</i>

32:18.186 --> 32:20.855
<i>Now we are all Miyagi-Do.</i>

32:22.774 --> 32:24.317
<i>But it's a new Miyagi-Do.</i>

32:26.444 --> 32:27.987
<i>The strongest we've ever been.</i>

32:29.405 --> 32:30.865
<i>And most badass.</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:33.534
<i>One purpose.</i>

32:34.410 --> 32:35.536
<i>One team.</i>

32:38.831 --> 32:39.958
<i>One dojo.</i>

32:40.667 --> 32:43.503
<i>With a name</i>
<i>steeped in tradition and honor.</i>

32:44.462 --> 32:46.047
<i>And a brand-new patch.</i>

32:48.383 --> 32:49.968
So get your asses ready.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.179
We may have settled things in the Valley,

32:54.222 --> 32:56.724
but now Miyagi-Do's ready
for whatever the world throws at us.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.629
Tell Kim Da-Eun

33:27.880 --> 33:29.757
that Cobra Kai is back.
