00:04.083 --> 00:05.500
<i>Ladies and</i>
<i>gentlemen, Woody Guthrie.</i>

00:57.666 --> 00:59.458
<i>...will take some pressure</i>
<i>off the kicking department...</i>

00:59.625 --> 01:01.791
<i>and Packers star kicker</i>
<i>Paul Hornung.</i>

01:01.958 --> 01:04.208
<i>For the NFC Eastern Conference</i>
<i>New York Giants...</i>

01:04.375 --> 01:06.083
<i>they'll be in their</i>
<i>away uniforms,</i>

01:06.291 --> 01:07.958
<i>white jerseys</i>
<i>with red numerals,</i>

01:08.041 --> 01:10.083
<i>blue helmets,</i>
<i>and silver football pants.</i>

01:10.708 --> 01:12.708
<i>The Giants are eight and three</i>
<i>at this stage of the season.</i>

01:13.333 --> 01:14.666
<i>Y.A. Tittle</i>
<i>is in at quarterback</i>

01:14.750 --> 01:15.750
<i>as usual for the Giants.</i>

01:16.166 --> 01:17.166
Thank you.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.958
He sang a country song,
that doesn't mean

02:25.041 --> 02:27.666
he's not still a Catholic
or a Communist.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
You're boxin' him in.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.166
You don't think
there's a difference

02:30.250 --> 02:31.500
between folk music
and country music?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.583
I didn't ask you
to box him in.

02:34.666 --> 02:35.791
Nobody asked you
to box him in.

02:35.958 --> 02:36.958
You did that.
I asked you a question,

02:37.041 --> 02:38.833
you answered a question.
There you go.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.875
All right. That's it.
That's enough for me.

02:42.541 --> 02:43.750
I'm off. Good night.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.250
Hey, mister,
you know where this place is?

02:49.333 --> 02:50.666
Called Greystone.

02:51.791 --> 02:53.416
I think Woody Guthrie's
in there.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.958
That's a, uh, hospital, pal.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.166
In Morris Plains.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.583
Where is that? Uptown?

03:01.083 --> 03:02.083
No.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.166
Woody's across the river
in New Jersey.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.958
Christ, I just came
from New Jersey.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.083
So go back.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.166
<i>All rise.</i>

03:14.583 --> 03:16.250
Mr. Seeger,
do you have anything to say

03:16.333 --> 03:17.958
before I pronounce
your sentence?

03:18.625 --> 03:21.833
In my whole life, I've never
said or done anything

03:22.000 --> 03:24.208
subversive to my country,
Your Honor.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.791
That's not why I'm here.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.375
I'm here because

03:27.458 --> 03:30.000
some second-rate politician
from Louisiana...

03:30.166 --> 03:32.541
decided that he don't like
a song I sang...

03:33.916 --> 03:36.000
...or maybe he don't like
some of the folks

03:36.083 --> 03:37.083
I might have sung it to.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.916
Mr. Seeger,
a jury has found you guilty

03:40.000 --> 03:41.458
of contempt of Congress.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.666
I refused to name names
and I...

03:43.833 --> 03:47.208
Refused questions!
Under a federal subpoena!

03:47.541 --> 03:49.291
Your Honor, you may know
a friend of mine,

03:49.375 --> 03:50.375
Woody Guthrie.

03:51.166 --> 03:52.708
Great songwriter
and a great American,

03:52.791 --> 03:53.958
and Woody's not well...

03:54.666 --> 03:56.083
but he's been much on my mind

03:56.250 --> 03:57.500
as I've been
going through this,

03:57.583 --> 03:58.833
'cause Woody once said that,

03:59.416 --> 04:01.250
"a good song
can only do good."

04:01.416 --> 04:02.416
That's right!

04:02.541 --> 04:05.125
And the song I'm in hot water
for here, it's a good song.

04:05.291 --> 04:06.458
It's a patriotic song,
in fact.

04:06.541 --> 04:07.541
Amen!

04:07.708 --> 04:08.708
And I thought,

04:08.875 --> 04:10.458
maybe you'd like to actually
hear the words,

04:10.541 --> 04:11.541
and I could play it for you.

04:11.666 --> 04:13.250
- And you'll know.
- No, no, no.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.541
No, you're not doing that.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.916
Quiet!

04:17.083 --> 04:19.000
- I said, quiet!
- Are you sure? It's free.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.791
Now, look at that,
the skies are clearing, see?

04:22.958 --> 04:24.375
Pete! Pete! Pete!

04:24.458 --> 04:25.458
Pete,
are you disappointed?

04:25.541 --> 04:26.583
Think you got a fair shake?

04:26.666 --> 04:27.708
Wish you'd testified, Pete?

04:27.791 --> 04:28.791
How do you feel
about the judgement?

04:28.958 --> 04:29.958
We didn't get the result

04:30.041 --> 04:31.041
that we thought was right,

04:31.166 --> 04:32.958
but we're free to fight
another day.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.083
I offered to play a song for
the judge up there

04:36.250 --> 04:37.416
but he didn't wanna hear it.

04:38.208 --> 04:40.833
But I feel like singing.
So, I'm gonna sing it for you.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.083
You know the words.

Excuse me, Mr. Guthrie.

06:47.916 --> 06:50.916
Well, no one calls him that
except the government.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.208
I'm not the government.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.083
Well, come on over, then.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.875
I'm Pete, by the way.

07:12.416 --> 07:14.625
Yes, sir.
No question about it.

07:15.541 --> 07:16.541
How about you?

07:17.291 --> 07:18.291
I'm Bobby.

07:19.416 --> 07:20.666
Something come after that?

07:22.125 --> 07:23.125
Dylan.

07:26.666 --> 07:29.833
Uh, Woody would like to know
more about that, Bobby Dylan.

07:29.916 --> 07:30.916
Oh, um...

07:31.416 --> 07:33.291
I sing and I... I play,

07:33.458 --> 07:35.458
and I write songs, actually,
a couple of friends of mine,

07:35.625 --> 07:37.125
Paul and John,
out in Minneapolis.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.416
Midwestern boy?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.666
Yeah, and they showed me
some of

07:40.750 --> 07:43.041
Woody's records, uh,
Folkway ones.

07:43.208 --> 07:46.208
Yours and Lead Belly and,
uh...

07:47.041 --> 07:50.041
I listened to 'em while they
struck me down to the ground.

07:52.375 --> 07:53.458
I like yours, too, Pete.

07:53.791 --> 07:54.875
Oh, that's fine.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.666
Anyways, uh,
Paul, my friend, uh,

07:57.833 --> 07:59.708
he said you was
in the hospital, so...

07:59.875 --> 08:01.208
I hitched myself here.

08:01.791 --> 08:02.833
Why is that?

08:03.458 --> 08:04.875
Well, I wanted to meet Woody.

08:07.666 --> 08:08.750
Maybe catch a spark.

08:33.708 --> 08:35.000
That's for damn sure.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.708
We had those printed up
for visitors.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.916
It's mostly family now,
though.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Uh,
Woody wants to hear something.

08:50.541 --> 08:51.541
You shy?

08:52.708 --> 08:53.750
Not usually.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.541
Well, this is one
I wrote for him.

09:38.416 --> 09:39.416
Uh...

12:31.291 --> 12:32.875
You like that
rock and roll music, then?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.541
Well, I like everything, Pete.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.500
Except maybe, uh,

12:37.291 --> 12:39.416
Patti Page and
<i>That Doggie in the Window</i>

12:39.500 --> 12:41.500
or, you know, Vaughn Monroe.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.125
I like Johnny Cash.
You ever hear of him?

12:44.291 --> 12:45.291
Oh, sure.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.250
Yeah, I like Hank Williams.

12:47.416 --> 12:48.416
Ah, now you're talking.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.291
Yeah.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.500
But if you're talking about
rock and roll, specifically,

12:52.666 --> 12:54.375
you gotta be talking about
Buddy Holly.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.666
You think of yourself
as a folk musician now,

12:56.750 --> 12:57.750
though. Yeah?

12:58.583 --> 13:00.708
Well, I don't think to myself
as a folk singer,

13:00.875 --> 13:02.666
you know, folk music thing.

13:02.833 --> 13:03.833
I mean, I do sing folk music,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.125
but when I do, it's sort of a
modified version or something.

13:06.291 --> 13:07.833
You know,
not a modified version,

13:07.916 --> 13:08.916
it's just, you know, sorta...

13:09.375 --> 13:10.916
A good song.
A really good song.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.666
It can get the job done
without the frills.

13:14.625 --> 13:18.083
Without drums or electrified
instruments or any of that.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.291
Yeah, but sometimes
they sound good.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.041
Hey, Tosh.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.166
This is Bobby,

13:46.791 --> 13:47.916
fellow traveler.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.458
He, uh, paid a visit to Woody
and he had nowhere to sleep.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.291
All right.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.791
Hi, Bob.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.416
- Toshi.
- Hello.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.666
Now,
we finally got a drill

13:58.833 --> 14:00.625
hard enough to get through
all this rock

14:00.708 --> 14:03.208
and now we got water
like a Swiss hotel.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.375
We'll set you up here.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.250
I snore and Toshi kicks me
out here all the time

14:09.416 --> 14:11.041
so, I can vouch
it's comfortable.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.333
The toilet's off
the hall there.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.916
It's a new composter.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.375
It's amazing.
It doesn't smell just...

14:16.458 --> 14:17.458
- Yes, it does.
- Smells so bad!

14:17.541 --> 14:18.750
Yes, it does. It smells awful!

14:19.000 --> 14:21.625
Go to bed, go to bed.
Traitors. All of you.

14:21.791 --> 14:23.416
Bobby, can you go outside
to smoke?

14:23.583 --> 14:24.583
Oh, sorry.

14:24.666 --> 14:27.791
If you get cold, just throw
that Indian blanket over you.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.458
Is he going to bed?

14:31.458 --> 14:33.375
He'll settle down.
He's just...

14:33.541 --> 14:35.791
excited because he met
one of his heroes tonight.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.666
Not me, Woody.

14:45.666 --> 14:47.541
He played us a hell of a song.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.541
Here's your pancake.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.750

28:23.875 --> 28:24.875
Yeah, last two.

28:26.875 --> 28:27.875
You're good.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.583
What, you mean for my age?

28:39.625 --> 28:40.791
Well, thanks.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.208
Who's that guy?

28:50.166 --> 28:51.416
That's Alan Lomax.

28:51.958 --> 28:53.250
That's what he does.

28:53.416 --> 28:55.375
He runs the Archive of
American Folk.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.250
They record folk music.

28:57.416 --> 28:58.666
How do you know so much?

28:59.375 --> 29:02.000
- My sister works for him.
- Oh.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.916
<i>♪ I'm gonna keep on walkin' ♪</i>

29:05.083 --> 29:08.333
<i>♪ Till I find my way</i>

29:08.875 --> 29:11.458
<i>♪ Walk on, Sonny boy</i>
<i>Walk on, boy ♪</i>

29:13.250 --> 29:14.250
You want a peanut?

29:15.541 --> 29:17.708
I used to live on these things
when I worked at the carnival.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.083
You worked at the carnival?

29:22.250 --> 29:24.708
Strongmen, fire-eaters.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.125
Oh, one lady,
her skin was all burnt off.

29:27.208 --> 29:29.041
She looked like a grown-up,
wrinkly baby.

29:29.208 --> 29:30.916
- Ew!
- Yeah.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.125
It made me think about
people on stage,

29:34.041 --> 29:36.000
about anyone who gets on
a stage, you know,

29:36.166 --> 29:38.916
anyone's who's gonna hold
your attention on a stage.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.458
Have to kinda be a freak.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.708
Not everyone.

29:42.875 --> 29:43.958
Anyone who's good.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.416
Are you a freak?

29:45.708 --> 29:46.750
Yeah, I hope so.

29:47.291 --> 29:48.875
Frank Sinatra's not a freak.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.666
Well,
that voice ain't human.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.333
You can be beautiful,
or you can be ugly,

29:53.416 --> 29:54.541
but you can't be plain.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.583
You gotta be something
people can't stop looking at,

29:56.750 --> 29:58.625
like a train wreck
or a car crash.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.208
Oh, you seen this?

30:00.958 --> 30:03.958
No. I thought we were going to
see Guernica at the Museum.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.416
Ah, Picasso's overrated.

30:07.458 --> 30:08.458
You got a dollar?

30:11.166 --> 30:12.541
Two for the matinee.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.916
<i>And will you be happy,</i>
<i>Charlotte?</i>

30:34.000 --> 30:36.583
<i>Oh, Jerry,</i>
<i>don't let's ask for the moon.</i>

30:37.250 --> 30:38.708
<i>We have the stars.</i>

30:50.916 --> 30:52.458
So...

30:52.625 --> 30:55.458
Bette Davis was a mousy girl,

30:55.958 --> 30:58.291
who had to escape
her domineering mother

30:58.375 --> 30:59.458
to find herself.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.000
- She runs away...
- "Find herself"?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.291
- ...becomes beautiful...
- I don't like that.

31:02.458 --> 31:04.791
...returns home,
destroys her mom,

31:04.958 --> 31:07.916
and adopts the child of a man
she can never have.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.250
She didn't "find herself"

31:09.416 --> 31:11.750
like her "self" was a missing
shoe or something.

31:11.958 --> 31:14.916
She just made herself
into something different.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.583
Something better.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.791
Different.

31:19.833 --> 31:20.833
Okay.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.250
You know,
what she wanted to be,

31:23.333 --> 31:24.375
in that moment.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.250
What do you wanna be?

31:30.916 --> 31:32.083
A musician.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.375
Who eats.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.333
Well, I like your songs.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.916
My record comes out
in a couple weeks.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.583
Some of the songs you played
today on your record?

31:46.958 --> 31:48.291
Well, it's mostly covers.

31:48.833 --> 31:50.125
Just traditional stuff.

31:51.416 --> 31:52.625
You know,
folk songs are supposed to

31:52.708 --> 31:54.166
stand the test of time,
like...

31:54.833 --> 31:57.125
um, Shakespeare or something.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.041
They say no one wants to hear
what a kid wrote last month.

32:01.708 --> 32:02.708
Who's they?

32:02.875 --> 32:04.083
Record company.

32:04.666 --> 32:05.666
My manager.

32:06.541 --> 32:07.541
I'm sorry,

32:08.625 --> 32:12.041
but <i>Where Have All the Flowers</i>
<i>Gone</i> is not Shakespeare.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.666
I mean,

32:15.833 --> 32:18.250
there was a time when the
old songs were new, right?

32:18.833 --> 32:21.333
Someone at some point had to
give the songs a chance.

32:21.416 --> 32:22.458
I mean...

32:22.541 --> 32:24.500
There's a civil war going on
down south.

32:24.666 --> 32:26.666
Biggest military buildup
in history.

32:26.833 --> 32:28.625
Nuclear bombs hanging over us.

32:28.791 --> 32:31.250
It's not all about
the Dust Bowl

32:31.416 --> 32:33.208
and Johnny Appleseed anymore.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.875
Monday to Thursday,
I'm at school.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.958
Then I volunteer at CORE,
Fridays and Saturdays.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.291
And I take a painting class
Sunday mornings in Queens.

32:43.375 --> 32:44.416
What's CORE?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.125
- Congress of Racial Equality.
- Oh, yeah.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.791
We organized
the freedom rides.

32:48.875 --> 32:49.875
All right.

32:53.708 --> 32:54.708
This is me.

32:57.458 --> 33:00.625
Dwight MacDonald wrote
a wonderful piece in here.

33:00.791 --> 33:01.958
I think you'll like him.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.833
He's contrarian, like you.

33:06.583 --> 33:08.083
All right, I'll take a look.

33:09.625 --> 33:10.750
What are you doin' tomorrow?

33:13.500 --> 33:14.666
I told you my schedule.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.083
Oh, yeah, painting. In Queens.

33:25.541 --> 33:27.500
I'm at my mom's
in the afternoon.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Call me there?

34:01.250 --> 34:03.291
Hey there. Have you got
any more Joan Baez?

34:03.458 --> 34:04.583
No, you got the last one.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.458
<i>Amidst the resistance</i>

34:07.541 --> 34:08.541

34:08.708 --> 34:11.125

34:11.291 --> 34:13.375

34:17.500 --> 34:20.625
Let us help you stimulate
your conscience.

34:35.666 --> 34:36.791
I've been publishing it,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.458
but the press
doesn't seem to notice.

34:39.625 --> 34:40.625
Hi.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.791
Package for,
uh, Zimmerman?

34:44.916 --> 34:48.041
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.166
-

35:00.708 --> 35:01.916

35:02.916 --> 35:03.916

- All right,

35:39.541 --> 35:40.541
just let me finish the verse.

35:40.666 --> 35:42.250
Mr. Guthrie needs quiet now.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.666
Whoa! You got a lotta nerve

35:43.750 --> 35:45.000
taking a cigarette out
a man's mouth.

35:45.166 --> 35:46.708
There is another gentleman
in this room,

35:46.791 --> 35:48.041
and he's trying to rest.

35:48.208 --> 35:49.291
You know,
he been resting six months.

35:49.375 --> 35:50.375
I don't think it's workin'.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.791
I'm trying to look out for
your health, Mr. Guthrie.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.750
You know,
last guy let us sing.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.708
Do I look like the last guy?

35:57.875 --> 35:59.625
No, you look like
a bona fide asshole.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.166
Whoa, easy, Bob.
Hello, George.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.583
Mr. Guthrie is here for
treatment, Mr. Seeger.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.708
- That's true, yeah.
- He has a serious disease,

36:05.875 --> 36:07.291
and he's sharin' his room
with a guest.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.166
Yeah, a guest in a coma!

36:09.333 --> 36:11.333
George, reasonable people
can work these things out.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.041
This is a hospital,
not a nightclub.

36:14.916 --> 36:17.708
Well, I guess every deck come
with two jokers, don't it?

36:21.166 --> 36:23.666
She's a new favorite.
I call her Jane.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.083
I'm moving away
from the abstract a bit

36:27.166 --> 36:28.708
and trying to move into faces.

36:28.875 --> 36:29.916
What about Hank Williams, Tom?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.041
In your estimable opinion,
is he country or folk?

36:32.208 --> 36:33.500
- He's country.
- It don't matter.

36:33.666 --> 36:35.000
'Cause he got pedal steel
behind him?

36:35.083 --> 36:36.166
Bob, man,
you're telling me

36:36.250 --> 36:37.250
there's no difference?

36:37.333 --> 36:38.916
Sylvie,
you gotta hear this, man.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
No, man.

36:40.083 --> 36:43.250
You can call it country or
blues or rock and roll,

36:43.416 --> 36:45.916
but we all keep rewriting
the same songs.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.750
Are these his friends
from his circus days?

37:09.041 --> 37:10.416
Stop it, Gena.

37:11.125 --> 37:12.291
Is his real name Zimmerman?

37:12.458 --> 37:13.458
Move along.

37:28.541 --> 37:30.166
<i>Mr. Johnny Cash!</i>

37:30.333 --> 37:32.500
<i>He started out</i>
<i>in country music</i>

37:32.583 --> 37:34.625
<i>and sorta made</i>
<i>the transition over into pop.</i>

37:34.791 --> 37:36.208
Ain't no transition, man.

37:36.375 --> 37:39.375
Gotta label him with
that corny bullshit, man.

37:40.208 --> 37:42.375
Please remember
garbage on Tuesdays.

37:42.541 --> 37:45.583
Except if Monday's a holiday,
which it will be next week.

37:45.750 --> 37:46.750
You got it.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.583
I have to do this.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.208
It's a school trip,
it's required.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.500
All right, you said that
already, like, three times.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.000
It's only 12 weeks.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.791
Well, God made the world
in six days.

37:55.958 --> 37:57.083
So?

37:57.250 --> 37:58.791
So, 12 weeks' a lot longer.

37:58.958 --> 38:01.083
What am I supposed to do
with the extra 65 days?

38:01.333 --> 38:02.625
Are you God, Bob?

38:02.791 --> 38:04.333
How many times
do I have to say this?

38:05.500 --> 38:06.500
Yes.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.791
I think about how much
I'm gonna miss you...

38:19.625 --> 38:20.750
then I realize...

38:22.500 --> 38:24.083
I don't know you.

38:27.291 --> 38:29.250
There's a face
on your driver's license.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.333
He's different.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.333
- Has a different name.
- Wow.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.875
When I get back, I'd like to
get to know that guy.

38:35.041 --> 38:36.041
Don't do this, Sylvie.

38:36.208 --> 38:37.708
You wrote
a five-minute song about

38:37.791 --> 38:39.500
this girl in Minneapolis.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.041
Who was that? What happened?

38:41.125 --> 38:42.541
You tell me you dropped out
of college...

38:42.625 --> 38:43.625
No, I didn't drop out
of college.

38:43.708 --> 38:44.708
- I didn't say that.
- You came here

38:44.791 --> 38:45.791
with nothing but a guitar.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.291
You never talk about
your family,

38:47.375 --> 38:48.416
your past,
besides the "carnival."

38:48.583 --> 38:50.333
'Cause people make up
their past, Sylvie.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.458
They remember what they want,
they forget the rest!

38:52.625 --> 38:54.166
I tell you everything.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.041
My folks, my sister,
the street I grew up on.

38:57.208 --> 38:58.583
Yeah, I never asked you
about any of it.

38:58.750 --> 38:59.916
What, you think
that stuff defines you?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.500
What I come from?

39:01.666 --> 39:04.750
What I want and what
I don't want, what I reject.

39:04.916 --> 39:06.666
- Yes!
- Mm.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.166
Good thing
you're going to Rome.

39:09.625 --> 39:10.625
And then what?

39:10.791 --> 39:13.583
I come back and live
with a mysterious minstrel?

39:15.500 --> 39:18.458
No, mysterious minstrels
sell more than 1,000 records.

39:19.875 --> 39:21.583
Maybe just don't
come back at all.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.125
Oh, Christ, come on, Sylvie.

39:41.791 --> 39:42.791
Stop hiding.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.291
We both know you can't wait to
have your place to yourself.

39:46.458 --> 39:48.208
Jesus. Part of me.

39:48.666 --> 39:49.791
Not all of me.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.083
What? You want me to make
sense 100% of the time?

39:53.958 --> 39:55.250
There's a lot I want.

39:55.833 --> 39:58.208
And you do too.
You're ambitious.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.583
I think that scares you.

40:01.958 --> 40:03.791
"The line has been drawn.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.791
"The curse has been cast.

40:05.958 --> 40:08.083
"The slow one
now will later be..."

40:11.833 --> 40:14.000
Your record was
all other people's music.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.125
<i>Good evening,</i>

40:24.208 --> 40:25.708
<i>my fellow citizens.</i>

40:25.958 --> 40:27.833
<i>This government, as promised,</i>

40:28.000 --> 40:30.875
<i>has maintained</i>
<i>the closest surveillance</i>

40:31.041 --> 40:33.083
<i>of the Soviet military buildup</i>

40:44.208 --> 40:46.000
<i>is now in preparation</i>

40:46.166 --> 40:47.625
<i>on that imprisoned island.</i>

40:48.416 --> 40:50.333
<i>The purpose of these bases</i>

40:50.500 --> 40:51.958
<i>can be none other</i>

40:52.125 --> 40:55.083
<i>than to provide a nuclear</i>
<i>strike capability</i>

40:55.250 --> 40:56.791
<i>against</i>
<i>the Western Hemisphere.</i>

40:57.666 --> 41:00.833
<i>Upon receiving the first</i>
<i>preliminary hard information</i>

41:01.000 --> 41:03.375
<i>last Tuesday morning</i>
<i>at 9:00 am...</i>

41:04.541 --> 41:06.875
<i>...I directed that our</i>
<i>surveillance be stepped up.</i>

41:07.375 --> 41:09.958
<i>It shall be the policy</i>
<i>of this nation</i>

41:10.125 --> 41:12.208
<i>to regard any nuclear missile</i>

41:12.375 --> 41:14.625
<i>launched from Cuba</i>
<i>against any nation</i>

41:14.708 --> 41:16.000
<i>in the Western Hemisphere</i>

41:16.166 --> 41:18.625
<i>as an attack</i>
<i>by the Soviet Union</i>

41:18.708 --> 41:19.875
<i>on the United States</i>

41:20.041 --> 41:22.875
<i>requiring a full</i>
<i>retaliatory response...</i>

41:23.500 --> 41:25.375
<i>If invasion is undertaken</i>

41:25.541 --> 41:28.041
<i>the Russians have said</i>
<i>that they would retaliate, uh,</i>

41:29.666 --> 41:31.083
<i>with, uh, rocket fire.</i>

41:31.250 --> 41:32.750
<i>We have said if there's</i>
<i>rocket fire from Cuba,</i>

41:32.916 --> 41:33.916
<i>we will retaliate</i>

41:34.083 --> 41:36.916
<i>and there goes</i>
<i>the whole ball game.</i>

41:37.083 --> 41:38.125
<i>So, how do we relate Berlin</i>
<i>as the...</i>

41:38.208 --> 41:39.375
What's on TV?

41:39.750 --> 41:41.166
<i>On the question of</i>
<i>immediate relief</i>

41:41.250 --> 41:42.291
<i>or optimism here</i>

41:42.458 --> 41:44.708
<i>that nobody in the White House</i>
<i>is willing to say...</i>

41:44.875 --> 41:46.583
Pick up.

41:46.666 --> 41:48.375
Come on.

41:48.541 --> 41:49.750
<i>They do not believe</i>
<i>that the 24 hours</i>

41:49.833 --> 41:51.583
<i>of waiting is over.</i>

41:51.875 --> 41:54.000
<i>There's still</i>
<i>considerable belief</i>

41:54.166 --> 41:56.375
<i>that the confrontation</i>
<i>in the Caribbean</i>

41:56.458 --> 41:58.041
<i>will come yet tonight.</i>

42:04.208 --> 42:05.583
<i>No one can guarantee</i>

42:05.666 --> 42:07.750
<i>that American families</i>
<i>on the eastern seaboard</i>

42:07.916 --> 42:09.416
<i>will be alive tomorrow.</i>

42:12.958 --> 42:13.958

Troubling time,

44:15.083 --> 44:16.833
<i>American forces stand on edge</i>

44:17.291 --> 44:19.916
<i>with naval ships positioned</i>
<i>throughout the Caribbean.</i>

45:12.708 --> 45:15.041
<i>The Unites States almost</i>
<i>went to nuclear war.</i>

45:15.208 --> 45:17.833
<i>Perhaps no one will ever know</i>
<i>how close it came</i>

45:18.000 --> 45:19.875
<i>except for Nikita Khrushchev</i>

45:19.958 --> 45:21.708
<i>who apparently</i>
<i>had no illusions.</i>

45:21.791 --> 45:23.291
<i>The feeling</i>
<i>in official Washington</i>

45:23.375 --> 45:26.000
<i>after one of the most</i>
<i>frightening weeks in history,</i>

45:26.250 --> 45:28.125
<i>is that it's too early</i>
<i>for elation</i>

45:28.291 --> 45:30.458
<i>but not too early</i>
<i>to wonder what happened,</i>

45:30.625 --> 45:31.625
<i>and why it happened.</i>

45:31.708 --> 45:34.166
<i>Moscow, of course,</i>
<i>in the last 48 hours</i>

45:34.666 --> 45:36.625
<i>has seemed contradictory</i>
<i>and zigzagged</i>

45:36.708 --> 45:39.291
<i>as if the Kremlin were having</i>
<i>a great, private debate.</i>

45:39.416 --> 45:42.125
<i>The I's are not dotted,</i>
<i>and the T's are not crossed,</i>

45:42.208 --> 45:43.916
<i>but everything seems easier.</i>

45:44.000 --> 45:45.666
<i>The mood here</i>
<i>is still cautious,</i>

45:45.750 --> 45:47.250
<i>spelled with a capital C.</i>

45:47.333 --> 45:50.208
<i>Khrushchev has offered to</i>
<i>remove his missiles from Cuba.</i>

45:50.291 --> 45:52.666
<i>If he does, we will call off</i>
<i>the quarantine</i>

45:52.750 --> 45:54.375
<i>and there will be no invasion.</i>

45:54.458 --> 45:55.958
<i>The President today called</i>

45:56.041 --> 45:58.291
<i>Khrushchev's decision</i>
<i>statesmanlike.</i>

45:58.375 --> 46:00.750
<i>Has the United States made</i>
<i>a deal with Moscow?</i>

46:00.916 --> 46:02.000
<i>The answer is no.</i>

46:02.541 --> 46:04.375
<i>What, then,</i>
<i>is in this for Khrushchev?</i>

46:04.791 --> 46:06.375
<i>There will be</i>
<i>no armed showdown,</i>

46:06.458 --> 46:08.125
<i>there will be no nuclear war.</i>

46:08.291 --> 46:10.375
<i>The Cuban problem</i>
<i>will still be there for us...</i>

46:10.541 --> 46:12.458
Well, that's that.

46:15.083 --> 46:16.083
<i>Now to the news...</i>

46:29.916 --> 46:31.166
Who taught you to play?

46:31.833 --> 46:33.375
Well, I taught myself really.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.583
Picked up a few licks
at the carnival.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.208
At the carnival?

46:41.666 --> 46:43.791
Oh, yeah, there was singin'
cowboys that'd come through,

46:43.958 --> 46:46.083
teach me all sorts of
funny chords.

46:46.666 --> 46:47.958
Yeah, they'd pass through
in the shows

46:48.041 --> 46:50.250
in, uh, Kansas or Dakotas.

46:52.291 --> 46:53.583
Yeah, these chords I learned

46:53.666 --> 46:55.375
from a cowboy
named Wigglefoot.

46:56.458 --> 46:57.791
You were in a carnival?

47:02.333 --> 47:04.416
You are so completely
full of shit.

47:06.625 --> 47:09.916
I had lessons as a kid,
you know, normal lessons.

47:10.333 --> 47:11.375
I write too.

47:11.458 --> 47:12.750
I'm not sure
there's a way to learn that.

47:16.541 --> 47:17.541
Too hard.

47:18.041 --> 47:19.041
Excuse me?

47:21.833 --> 47:22.916
You try too hard.

47:24.583 --> 47:25.583
To write.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Really?

47:27.166 --> 47:28.416
Yeah, if you're askin'.

47:30.583 --> 47:31.583
I wasn't.

47:32.791 --> 47:34.666
Sunsets and seagulls.

47:34.833 --> 47:36.125
Smell of buttercups.

47:36.833 --> 47:38.333
Your songs are like
an oil painting

47:38.416 --> 47:39.791
at the dentist's office.

47:42.125 --> 47:44.291
You're kind of an asshole,
Bob.

47:45.708 --> 47:47.000
Yeah, I guess.

47:53.583 --> 47:54.583
Play this.

- Albert!
- Yes, sir.

53:36.666 --> 53:38.666
I don't want 'em to
shoot my desk, man.

53:39.708 --> 53:41.916
Pal, what did I say
to you? No desk.

53:42.083 --> 53:43.875
- You can plug that here.
- What did I say?

53:44.291 --> 53:45.791
No, Sylvie,
don't bring 'em in here.

53:45.958 --> 53:47.666
I didn't bring them, Bob,
you did.

53:47.833 --> 53:48.875
They're here for you.

53:50.208 --> 53:51.291
That for Woody?

53:51.458 --> 53:53.208
Yeah, I'm gonna drop it off
on the way to the airport.

53:53.375 --> 53:55.000
Here. Put your finger there.

53:59.541 --> 54:01.250
- Is that Joan?
- Yeah.

54:02.416 --> 54:04.125
So, she's covering your song?

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Yeah.

54:06.833 --> 54:08.250
Before your version comes out?

54:09.125 --> 54:10.458
Albert thinks it helps.

54:11.375 --> 54:12.375
Helps her.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.708
Helps him sign her.

54:15.041 --> 54:16.375
She's famous, Sylvie.

54:17.791 --> 54:19.500
Been on the cover of
<i>Time Magazine.</i>

54:20.791 --> 54:21.791
They recorded her live.

54:21.958 --> 54:23.541
She didn't know they were
gonna put it on the radio.

54:24.833 --> 54:25.833
'Course not.

54:31.916 --> 54:33.166
So, you gave her the song.

54:33.333 --> 54:34.750
I didn't give her the song.

54:34.916 --> 54:36.958
Bobby,
we're ready over here, pal.

54:37.291 --> 54:39.250
You're gonna see her
in California?

54:39.583 --> 54:41.208
Well, it's her festival.

54:46.583 --> 54:47.666
Okay,
he's all set up here.

54:47.750 --> 54:48.750
I'm just tryin' to
get on a plane

54:48.833 --> 54:49.875

54:50.916 --> 54:51.916
Okay, right here.

54:52.666 --> 54:53.750
You're in the shot,
sweetheart.

55:09.250 --> 55:10.250
Hey, there.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.375

Hey, Bob.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:54.833
You got kids?

01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:57.291
Yeah.

01:10:59.833 --> 01:11:01.000
Thousands of 'em.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:27.958
He's here.

01:11:29.583 --> 01:11:30.583
Excuse me, one second.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.666
Hey, Bob. Bobby.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.000
Come on in.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:35.250
- Here, let me take your jacket.
- Oh, thank you.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:36.833
Shirley, here.
Take this, please.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.958
It's a wonderful cause. We
truly appreciate you coming.

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.125
- You good? You happy?
- Yeah.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:41.208
You thirsty?

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:42.333
Is there a bar
or somethin'?

01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:43.458
Yeah.
This way, my friend.

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:44.916
Hey, Bob.
I love <i>Tambourine Man.</i>

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.083
Oh, thanks.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:47.375
So when's the new album out?

01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:48.541
Uh, soon.

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.958
Can songs really
change things, Bob?

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.083
Well, they change keys.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.458
Bobby!

01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.666
We miss you at the Archive!

01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.208
How are you?
Word on the street

01:11:58.375 --> 01:12:01.291
is you're making quite a noise
down there in Studio A, huh?

01:12:01.458 --> 01:12:02.625
This is Becka, by the way.

01:12:02.708 --> 01:12:03.708
Nice to meet you.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.916
Listen, Bob, you don't have to
compete with the Beatles.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.083
You are better than that shit.

01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:09.916
Alan, you're obsessed
with the Beatles. Please.

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:12.750
Can I get two glasses
of red wine, please?

01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:13.833
You didn't bring your guitar
with you, Bobby.

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:14.958
What, are you saving yourself

01:12:15.041 --> 01:12:16.083
for your little tour
with Joanie?

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:17.750
Not little, Harold. Sold out.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:18.875
Whoa! Hey, listen,
that's wonderful!

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:20.125
And honestly,
the last thing I wanna do now

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.208
is put pressure on you,

01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:24.416
but the dirty little secret
is most everybody here is here

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.583
'cause they're hoping
you'd play a little something.

01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:27.333
Where'd they get that idea,
Harold?

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:28.416
What'd you pull me into, man?

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.500
Is this a fucking gig
or something?

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:30.916
The prodigal. It's anything
you want it to be.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.291
- He's back. Hi.
- Hey, Pete.

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:33.458
- How you doin'?
- Good.

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:34.625
- Nice to see you.
- Great to see you.

01:12:34.708 --> 01:12:35.708
Toshi, how are you doin'?

01:12:35.833 --> 01:12:37.541
Well, you made it around
the world in 80 days, huh?

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:38.708
Magic carpet ride.

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:40.708
Just full of wonder.
Full of wonder.

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:42.125
This is Becka, by the way.

01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:44.166
Nice to meet you.
This is my wife, Toshi.

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:45.250
Nice to meet you.

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:47.125
I absolutely love your music.

01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:48.333
I'm such a big fan,
Mr. Seeger.

01:12:48.416 --> 01:12:49.416
No. No, I'm Pete.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.500
Pete.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.458
Harold is putting the lean
on you, yeah?

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:55.000
- Trying to get you to play?
- Yeah, little bit.

01:12:55.166 --> 01:12:56.958
All right. Well,
don't hold it against him.

01:12:57.125 --> 01:12:58.708
It's for a good cause.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.166
Wanna use this beauty?

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.750
You always keep it handy,
huh, Pete?

01:13:04.416 --> 01:13:06.125
He's like a gunfighter
with his six-gun.

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:07.458
Always keeping it close.

Hey, thank you, Bob. Truly.

01:13:54.666 --> 01:13:56.208
Listen, don't forget to
sing out that thing next time.

01:13:56.375 --> 01:14:00.041
Talk to me about that, Harold.
Have fun. Have a good night.

01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:01.208
You were amazing.

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:02.625
Two hundred people
in that room

01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:04.916
and each one wants me
to be somebody else.

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.666
They should just fuck off
and let me be.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.125
Be what?

01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:16.750
Excuse me?

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:19.125
They should fuck off
and let you be what?

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.583
I don't know.

01:14:24.916 --> 01:14:26.625
Whatever it is
they don't want me to be.

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:31.500
Yeah, well, I'm not a horse,

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:35.375
so I don't like carrying
other people's weight.

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.458
Yeah. Well, I got
a hundred pounds on me

01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:42.625
that don't show on that scale.

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:45.875
How do you sing, then?

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:52.000
I put myself in another place.

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:55.916
But I'm a stranger there.

01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:09.333
Hey, what's your name, man?

01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:13.250
Bobby. Like you, man.

01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:14.875
Bobby Neuwirth.

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.041
Where you goin'?

01:15:16.166 --> 01:15:18.916
I got a gig with some guys
in the East Village.

01:15:19.083 --> 01:15:20.791
Spot called McAnn's.

01:15:27.666 --> 01:15:28.750
Hey.

01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:30.125
Hey.

01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:32.375
You have a tour
with Joan Baez.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:34.125
Were you gonna tell me
about that?

01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:37.250
Am I just more weight?

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:40.875
They wanna own me, Becka.
Is that what you want?

01:15:42.416 --> 01:15:43.791
I love you.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.833
Is that scary to you?

01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:51.208

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.958

You know, everyone asks where
these songs come from, Sylvie.

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:06.625
But when you watch their faces,

01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:09.291
they're not asking
where the songs come from.

01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:13.875
They're asking why the songs
didn't come to them.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:20.083

George! Victor said
he went by the shop

01:20:20.708 --> 01:20:22.083
and got fitted for
your daughter's wedding.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.291
- Hello, hello, hello.
- There he is.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:25.125
Welcome to the center
of the universe.

01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:26.333
Alan,
let's talk Newport.

01:20:26.416 --> 01:20:27.708
Hello, Harold. Peter.

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:29.875
All right. Give me Saturday
night again, please.

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:33.250
- Yes, we have Ian and Sylvia.
- Right.

01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:35.625
Odetta, Donovan,

01:20:35.791 --> 01:20:37.708
Johnny Cash and Kweskin...

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.458
And Theodore Bikel.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:41.500
Yes,
I was just getting to me.

01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:43.208
I also have this proposal
on the table

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:44.458
for the Butterfield
Blues Band.

01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.666
Remind me who they are.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:48.125
- Chicago blues band.
- Electric blues band.

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.125
A white electric blues band.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:51.291
They're hot, Alan.

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.416
The guitarist,
Mike Bloomfield,

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.500
is unbelievable.

01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:54.625
Oh, yeah. I'm sure he is.

01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:57.083
He comes from that
Albert Grossman's stable

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:58.208
like you, Peter.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:20:59.541
Knock it off.

01:20:59.708 --> 01:21:02.625
I hear Bob
is playing electric now.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.916
Not on our stage, he isn't.

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:07.000
There is no rock and roll
in Newport.

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:09.083
We don't need to be dogmatic.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.250
Okay, okay.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:11.625
So, what is the
verdict on the Butterfields?

01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:13.833
We already have blues players.
And we got real ones.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.250
You never heard them, Alan.

01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:16.958
Newport Folk Festival
was created

01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:19.708
to fight a riptide
of inauthentic shit.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:20.958
- I understand that...
- No,

01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:22.125
you don't understand, Peter.

01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.041
I'm sorry, but Peter,
Paul and Mary is a confection.

01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.208
- Paul's name ain't even Paul.
- Okay, Alan.

01:21:27.375 --> 01:21:28.541
Albert Grossman
changed his name...

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:29.666
All right, all right.

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:30.958
...because he thought
it sounded better.

01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:32.041
Thank you so much.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.250
It's like fucking
Ritz Crackers.

01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:35.000
Now, stop it. Stop it!

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:36.166
Now, Peter,
don't go, don't go.

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:38.125
We're gonna work it out.
We're gonna work it out.

01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:40.166
We are here
to celebrate folk music.

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:42.916
From the people,
for the people, Pete.

01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:44.291
The sound of a guitar

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:46.041
- and a man's voice.
- Or a woman's.

01:21:46.208 --> 01:21:47.250
Alan, please. Let's calm down.

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:48.458
Don't talk to me about
ticket sales, Harold.

01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:49.666
- I don't give a shit.
- Okay.

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:54.708
Hey, Tom, give me a second,
I want to try something.

01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.333
All right.

01:22:07.708 --> 01:22:09.416
You're in trouble, man.

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:11.958
<i>Highway 61,</i>
take seven.

01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.500
Man, you can't look at me
like that.

01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:16.291
'Cause then...

01:22:16.458 --> 01:22:18.041
All right, guys.

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:19.750
Okay, wait.
Don't look at me like that,

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:21.166
'cause I gotta
get through the take.

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:23.708
If you got that thing on
your face, I'm gonna explode.

01:22:23.875 --> 01:22:25.916
All right,
let's just do it before

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.083
this whole thing
crashes into the ground.

01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:32.250

tonight, we'll continue
our <i>Rainbow Quest</i> together

01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:22.458
to seek out all the songs

01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:23.833

Now, if you tuned in tonight

01:23:27.791 --> 01:23:29.541
hoping to hear our friend,
Bob Dylan,

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.541
well, I don't wanna
disappoint you,

01:23:31.708 --> 01:23:34.083
but Bob's been hung up
in the studio in New York.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.250
He'll come another time.

01:23:35.416 --> 01:23:38.041
But tonight, we've got
a very special guest.

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:40.416
A good friend of mine
from the deep

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.208
Mississippi Delta
named Jesse Moffette.

01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:45.375
And when he heard we had
a gap, he jumped in a cab,

01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:47.875
and he came right over
and he's live with us at NJU.

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:50.291
- Thanks for being here.
- Well, thanks for having me.

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.458
So good to be with ya.

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:53.541
Well, you want to have
a drink with me?

01:23:54.416 --> 01:23:57.000
Oh, no, no. Not while
I'm working. No. Yeah.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.416
What kinda station
is this anyway?

01:23:58.583 --> 01:23:59.916
This is educational, Jesse.

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:02.125
This is a local public
educational channel, yeah.

01:24:02.333 --> 01:24:04.833
Educational?
Shit, I do educational!

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.083
I offer blues lessons in
the privacy of your own home.

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:09.791

- Sure.

Jesse, say hi to a really
good friend of mine.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.750
This is Bobby Dylan.

01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:41.916
Bob. What kinda music
do you play?

01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:43.541
Well, I play all sorts.
I mean...

01:25:43.625 --> 01:25:44.708
What kinda music
do you say I play?

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:45.791
Oh, Bob plays a lot of kinds

01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:47.291
and he plays all of them well.

01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:48.833
You trying to steal my spot?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.791
No, I'm not trying to
steal your spot, Jesse.

01:25:50.958 --> 01:25:52.625
I was really
I was trying to figure out

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:53.791
what kinda tuning
you were using.

01:25:53.958 --> 01:25:55.125
I don't think
I ever heard it before.

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:56.583
Nobody can, only me.

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:58.833
Look here. How close
were you watching me?

01:25:59.375 --> 01:26:01.291
Well, I was, uh...

01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:05.125
Well, I was watching
real close, Jesse.

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:07.458
I got these
special binoculars, right?

01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:09.208
And they allow me
to see into your soul.

01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:10.875
Really?

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.083
I see exactly
what you were playing.

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.166
It's like a tiny
little microscope, right?

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.250
Oh, watch out.

01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:15.333
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:16.500
Do me a favor. Here.

01:26:16.666 --> 01:26:18.541
Take my guitar and show me
how close you really

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:19.625
- was watching, my man.
- No, I can't.

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:20.708
Couldn't do that, Jesse,

01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:21.833
that's like
touching your woman.

01:26:21.916 --> 01:26:23.791
It's okay. All right. Just
don't squeeze her too tight.

01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:26.625
- It's all right, Pete?
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:28.166
It's a family station.
You can...

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.166

I don't squeeze her too tight.

01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.541

Appropriate?

01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:06.625
Just fuck off and sing.

01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:14.791

Sylvie! He's gonna ask
where you are.

01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:32.916
- Tell him I went home.
- Why?

01:45:33.333 --> 01:45:34.625
I can't do it.

01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:35.791
I thought I could, but...

01:45:35.958 --> 01:45:37.583
Just stay and talk to him,
all right?

01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:39.708
He's got a lot of people
to talk to,

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.500
like 100,000.

01:45:41.666 --> 01:45:42.875
You can't take a cab
to the Village from here.

01:45:43.041 --> 01:45:44.041
You getting in, Miss?

01:45:44.208 --> 01:45:45.541
There's a ferry to Providence,
it leaves every other hour.

01:45:45.708 --> 01:45:47.916

there, just take a second.

Yeah,
take that shirt off, man.

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:10.291
You look like a goddamn clown.

01:46:10.916 --> 01:46:12.541
Anybody here see
where Sylvie went?

01:46:14.250 --> 01:46:15.458
Hey, Bobby.

01:46:16.291 --> 01:46:17.916
Hey, you know where Sylvie is?

01:46:18.583 --> 01:46:20.125
She split while you were
playing with Joan.

01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:21.791
What do you mean she split?

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.500
I didn't wanna sink you, man.

01:46:23.666 --> 01:46:26.625
Anybody home?
Hello, Albert.

01:46:26.708 --> 01:46:28.416
- Oh, my.
- Oh, God.

01:46:28.583 --> 01:46:29.625
She was headed
for the ferry.

01:46:29.791 --> 01:46:31.625
You probably still got time to
catch her if you head out now.

01:46:32.083 --> 01:46:33.083
Christ, Bobby.

01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:34.250
Bobby, can I have a word?

01:46:34.416 --> 01:46:35.500
Can we just turn that
down, please? Maybe?

01:46:35.708 --> 01:46:37.250
Where's Pete?
He's not in on this?

01:46:37.416 --> 01:46:38.583
"In on" what, exactly?

01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:40.208
Posse of purity.

01:46:40.375 --> 01:46:41.708
No, we are on our own.

01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:43.083
Sorry, I gotta go.

01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.250
Bob, my friend...

01:46:44.333 --> 01:46:45.666
All we want to know
is what you're planning

01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:47.208
on doing tomorrow, Bobby.

01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:49.166
If you're gonna play
the new songs, that's all.

01:46:49.375 --> 01:46:51.166
'Cause you want me
playing the old ones?

01:46:51.333 --> 01:46:54.125
All right, let's just cut
the crap, Bob. Come on.

01:46:54.291 --> 01:46:55.708
You're gonna be playing noise
like this?

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:56.875
This is The Kinks.

01:46:57.041 --> 01:46:58.083
I'm supposed to introduce you.

01:46:58.166 --> 01:46:59.208
And if you are,
just let me know.

01:46:59.291 --> 01:47:00.375
And we'll get Dick Clark
to introduce...

01:47:00.458 --> 01:47:01.958
Whoo-hoo! You hear that?

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:03.708
You wanna get Dick Clark
to Newport Folk Festival?

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:04.958
I don't know if you noticed,

01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:06.041
but there's a lot of
fucking people here...

01:47:06.125 --> 01:47:07.125
How could I not?

01:47:07.291 --> 01:47:10.541
I'd rather have 10 faithful
than 10,000 groupies!

01:47:10.708 --> 01:47:12.458
It was the Newport
Folk Festival, then Bob,

01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:16.000
and it still is
the Newport Folk Festival.

01:47:16.166 --> 01:47:19.208
Not the teen dream,
uh, Brill Building,

01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.083
Top 40,
British Invasion Festival.

01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:22.500
A folk festival!

01:47:22.666 --> 01:47:24.208
Do you even remember
folk music, Bob?

01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:26.041
No, Alan, what's that?

01:47:26.208 --> 01:47:27.541
Maybe you could
sing me somethin'.

Hey, Sylvie.

01:48:06.291 --> 01:48:07.375
Where are you going?

01:48:08.416 --> 01:48:09.416
I'm going home.

01:48:10.041 --> 01:48:11.125
Why?

01:48:12.583 --> 01:48:14.166
It was fun to be

01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:15.875
on the carnival train
with you, Bobby,

01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:19.791
but I think I gotta step off.

01:48:22.458 --> 01:48:25.833
I feel like one of those
plates, you know,

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:28.583
that the French guy spins
on those sticks

01:48:28.666 --> 01:48:29.833
on <i>The Sullivan Show.</i>

01:48:31.666 --> 01:48:33.666
Oh, I kinda like that guy.

01:48:36.291 --> 01:48:38.875
I'm sure it's fun
to be the guy, Bob,

01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:42.208
but I was a plate.

01:49:09.791 --> 01:49:11.666
Oh, Christ.

01:49:15.291 --> 01:49:18.166
Stay. Come on.

01:49:20.625 --> 01:49:24.000
Don't ask for the moon,
we have the stars.

01:49:34.625 --> 01:49:35.708
Sylvie.

01:49:39.916 --> 01:49:40.916
Sylvie.

01:50:14.125 --> 01:50:16.041
Rise, sunshine.

01:50:16.208 --> 01:50:17.208
Oh, Christ.

01:50:17.333 --> 01:50:19.000
Here you go. Morning.

01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:21.875
Thought we could have a chat,

01:50:21.958 --> 01:50:23.375
so, I brought you
a cup of hot black

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.416
and, uh,
one with milk for Sylvie.

01:50:25.583 --> 01:50:26.625
Hey.

01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:28.500
What the fuck?

01:50:30.375 --> 01:50:31.500
Morning, Albert.

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:33.125
It's 7:00 in the morning.

01:50:33.625 --> 01:50:34.625
Fuck.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:35.833
Whatever this is, Pete,

01:50:35.916 --> 01:50:37.750
maybe you could wait
another few goddamn hours.

01:50:37.916 --> 01:50:41.333
Well, it is the last day
of our festival, Albert,

01:50:42.625 --> 01:50:44.458
and I think people would like
to know what's coming.

01:50:44.625 --> 01:50:46.333
So, I'm here to have
a conversation

01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:47.833
with my old friend.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.750
Bobby,
did I ever tell you my, uh,

01:50:49.833 --> 01:50:52.250
my parable of
the teaspoon brigade?

01:50:52.416 --> 01:50:54.625
The parable of
the fucking what?

01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:56.875
It's the crack of
fucking dawn here!

01:50:57.041 --> 01:50:58.416
It's a good story.

01:50:58.583 --> 01:51:00.125
Okay.

01:51:00.208 --> 01:51:02.125
Bob needs his rest, all right?

01:51:02.291 --> 01:51:03.666
We all need our rest.

01:51:03.833 --> 01:51:06.250
It's all right.
Let him tell his story, Al.

01:51:07.625 --> 01:51:09.541
Come on,
give it to me good, Pete.

01:51:09.708 --> 01:51:12.208
All right. Imagine,
we got a seesaw.

01:51:12.375 --> 01:51:14.083
- Seesaw?
- Yeah.

01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:16.041
Okay.

01:51:16.166 --> 01:51:18.625
One end of it, it's anchored
firm to the ground

01:51:18.791 --> 01:51:21.500
'cause it's got
a basket full of rocks on it.

01:51:21.666 --> 01:51:23.791
The other end,
it's floating up here,

01:51:23.875 --> 01:51:25.083
way up in the air

01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:26.500
and wishin' it could come down

01:51:26.666 --> 01:51:28.750
but all it's got is a basket
that's half full of sand

01:51:28.916 --> 01:51:30.666
and the sand is leaking out
all the time.

01:51:30.916 --> 01:51:32.041
Okay, now...

01:51:32.125 --> 01:51:33.208
Could you get me a cigarette,
man?

01:51:33.375 --> 01:51:34.708
We see this situation.

01:51:34.875 --> 01:51:36.875
We say, well, maybe we should
do something about this.

01:51:37.291 --> 01:51:39.708
And all we got with us
is some teaspoons

01:51:39.875 --> 01:51:41.041
but we take 'em out
and we start

01:51:41.125 --> 01:51:42.583
putting sand up
into that basket

01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:45.583
and it's running out
as fast as we can put it in.

01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:47.291
There's all kinds of people.

01:51:47.458 --> 01:51:49.500
They're looking at us
and they're laughin'

01:51:49.666 --> 01:51:52.166
and they're sayin', "Geez,
you're wastin' your time."

01:51:52.333 --> 01:51:55.416
But every day a few
new people show up

01:51:55.583 --> 01:51:57.750
and they bring their spoons,
and they start pitchin' in.

01:51:58.250 --> 01:52:00.083
- You know why?
- Why?

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:01.750
Because
one of these days,

01:52:01.916 --> 01:52:03.166
enough people
are gonna put sand

01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:04.791
in that basket
at the same time

01:52:04.958 --> 01:52:07.333
that the whole damn thing
just goes, zoop.

01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:10.125
And we level things out.

01:52:11.375 --> 01:52:14.500
Okay. Thanks, Pete.
We get the story.

01:52:14.666 --> 01:52:15.875
I don't think you do, Albert.

01:52:16.041 --> 01:52:18.166
Bobby, Newport, we built it

01:52:18.333 --> 01:52:22.625
for the purpose of sharing
traditional folk music.

01:52:22.875 --> 01:52:24.791
We started it six years ago,

01:52:25.041 --> 01:52:26.666
and every year since then,

01:52:27.125 --> 01:52:29.125
more and more people
have been showing up,

01:52:29.208 --> 01:52:30.750
and they're bringing
their teaspoons.

01:52:31.708 --> 01:52:33.541
Teaspoons for justice,

01:52:33.708 --> 01:52:36.500
and teaspoons for peace
and teaspoons for love,

01:52:37.708 --> 01:52:39.416
and that's what we do and...

01:52:41.458 --> 01:52:43.666
Gosh, you showed up, Bobby,

01:52:43.833 --> 01:52:45.625
and damn it,
if you didn't bring a shovel.

01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:48.166
Really.

01:52:48.333 --> 01:52:49.375
I mean,
we're all here just laboring

01:52:49.458 --> 01:52:50.750
with our little teaspoons

01:52:50.916 --> 01:52:52.541
and you come
and bring a shovel.

01:52:53.208 --> 01:52:56.333
And thanks to you,
we're almost there.

01:52:57.333 --> 01:53:00.000
We're on the verge
of tipping it, Bob,

01:53:01.083 --> 01:53:02.791
and you're our closing act.

01:53:03.666 --> 01:53:06.125
And tonight, if you could

01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:07.708
just get up there
one more time

01:53:07.791 --> 01:53:09.833
and use that shovel
in the right way...

01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.666
The right way?

01:53:11.833 --> 01:53:14.333
You could
level things out, Bob.

01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:21.208
You know, I sent you an
advance of my new record.

01:53:22.541 --> 01:53:24.125
Sure. Yeah, I got it.

01:53:27.166 --> 01:53:28.666
Did you ever listen
to the music

01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:30.041
you're telling me not to play?

01:53:31.166 --> 01:53:33.291
I can see the direction
you're goin' in.

01:53:33.458 --> 01:53:35.541
I could see it
on the last record.

01:53:40.041 --> 01:53:43.166
You know, it... it's not...

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:46.833
No, don't take it that way.

01:53:46.916 --> 01:53:50.583
Bobby, you write great songs
that are leadin' to change

01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:52.125
- and we're a folk festival.
- Nothing's changin', Pete.

01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:53.541
- Why is this controversial?
- Nothing's changing.

01:53:53.708 --> 01:53:55.125
Nothing's changing.
What, not at all.

01:53:55.291 --> 01:53:57.208
Kennedy's dead.
They just shot Malcolm X.

01:53:57.375 --> 01:53:58.583
Well, isn't that
all the more reason.

01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:00.166
You know,
there's more to sing about

01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:01.375
than justice, Pete.

01:54:01.541 --> 01:54:03.333
There's more than
one way to play a song.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.875
You ever just take a second
and think that maybe

01:54:04.958 --> 01:54:06.291
it's more fun to be in
a fucking band, man?

01:54:06.458 --> 01:54:08.041
You don't understand, Bobby,
they just want me singing

01:54:08.125 --> 01:54:09.666
<i>Blowin' in the Wind</i> all alone

01:54:09.833 --> 01:54:11.208
for the rest of
my goddamn life.

01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:12.833
All we're talkin' about
is tonight.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.125
He's scared of your music,
Bob.

01:54:14.208 --> 01:54:15.875
Nobody's scared of
anybody's music.

01:54:15.958 --> 01:54:16.958
You are.
You're scared that the kids

01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:18.208
out on that lawn
might like it.

01:54:18.375 --> 01:54:19.416
And why would
I be afraid of that?

01:54:19.583 --> 01:54:21.791
Because you're pushing candles
and he's selling light bulbs.

01:54:21.958 --> 01:54:23.041
Albert, there's only one of us

01:54:23.125 --> 01:54:24.208
who's focused on
how much we're selling

01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:25.333
and it ain't me.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.500
Hey, Bobby, Bobby...

01:54:33.208 --> 01:54:36.083
Oh, Christ, man. Shit.

01:54:41.666 --> 01:54:43.958
Am I blocking you in, pal?

01:54:44.541 --> 01:54:45.583
Hey, JR.

01:54:45.958 --> 01:54:47.958
Johnny, it's me. It's Bobby.

01:54:48.125 --> 01:54:49.541
Hey! Shit, Bobby.

01:54:49.708 --> 01:54:50.708
Yeah!

01:54:52.666 --> 01:54:54.000
Thought you left town already.

01:54:54.875 --> 01:54:56.958
Well,
we loaded out last night.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.833
June left for New York
with her mama.

01:55:02.625 --> 01:55:05.541
Pete asked me to stay for
the finale today, you know,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.541
and I couldn't sleep.

01:55:08.250 --> 01:55:09.916
Just took a drive.

01:55:11.125 --> 01:55:12.416
Saw the ocean.

01:55:13.666 --> 01:55:14.666
Okay.

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:16.583
- This yours?
- Yeah.

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.000
Hey, man, you got a cigarette?

01:55:19.083 --> 01:55:20.125
Yeah.

01:55:21.166 --> 01:55:22.166
Thanks.

01:55:23.666 --> 01:55:25.083
Let me get outta your way.

01:55:27.208 --> 01:55:29.875
A guy I knew in the Air Force
had a Triumph.

01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:35.250
Gotta prime it up!

01:55:39.875 --> 01:55:41.500
Oh, shit.

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.541
Good. Good.

01:55:46.166 --> 01:55:47.166
Whoops.

01:55:52.875 --> 01:55:55.083
- Want a Bugle?
- Nah.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.833
You playing tonight?

01:55:57.416 --> 01:55:59.208
Yeah, that's what
the program says,

01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:02.833
but I'm not sure
they wanna hear

01:56:02.916 --> 01:56:04.375
what I wanna play, Johnny.

01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:06.916
- Who's they?
- Uh, you know,

01:56:08.458 --> 01:56:10.708
the men who decide
what folk music is.

01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:15.125
Well, fuck them.

01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:18.166
I wanna hear it.

01:56:22.166 --> 01:56:24.000
Make some noise, BD.

01:56:25.208 --> 01:56:27.083
Track some mud on the carpet.

01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:41.125
It's getting nuts out there.

01:56:46.458 --> 01:56:48.791
Three songs, get out.
Thank you, good night.

01:56:48.958 --> 01:56:50.208
Electric or acoustic?

01:56:53.791 --> 01:56:55.875
How crazy is it
gonna be tonight, Bob?

01:56:56.041 --> 01:56:57.500
Uh, pretty crazy.
Come check it out.

01:56:57.666 --> 01:56:59.416
It's sold out.
We can't hear it.

01:57:00.125 --> 01:57:01.500

Why would I wanna do that,
Albert?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000

That crowd
