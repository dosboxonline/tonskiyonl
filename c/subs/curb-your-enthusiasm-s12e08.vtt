Mr. David,
what brings you to Georgia?

00:33.759 --> 00:40.365
Well, um, I'm on trial
for the horrible crime of...

00:40.365 --> 00:43.638
giving a woman
who was on line to vote...

00:44.238 --> 00:45.304
a bottle of water.

00:45.304 --> 00:48.173
Oh!
Oh, what a terrible thing.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.541
Oh, what a terrible crime.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.976
What... What...
What... What... What... What...

00:51.976 --> 00:54.746
What a terrible crime
to give her a bottle of water.

00:54.746 --> 00:56.014
Okay, Larr-- Larr.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.151
Let's do it like we're actually
in the trial. Okay?

00:59.151 --> 01:00.452
Which means
you have to stay silent

01:00.452 --> 01:01.855
and only answer the questions.

01:01.855 --> 01:03.722
- Copy that.
- Thank you.

01:03.722 --> 01:08.227
So, Larry, Georgia gets
thousands of visitors a year

01:08.227 --> 01:11.463
here to experience
our beautiful springs,

01:11.463 --> 01:13.832
our peach trees. Well, what...

01:13.832 --> 01:16.535
What is it that brought you here
to Georgia in the first place?

01:16.535 --> 01:19.738
I was offered an appearance fee
to show up at this party,

01:19.738 --> 01:23.775
- and I was told to be cordial.
- Cordial?

01:23.775 --> 01:26.479
And you know what?
I was pretty damn cordial.

01:26.479 --> 01:28.314
I asked questions to people.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.781
"Oh, does your son
take piano lessons?"

01:29.781 --> 01:31.450
- Larry, just--
-"Does he practice?

01:31.450 --> 01:32.551
It's hard to get him
to practice.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.886
They don't like to practice."

01:33.886 --> 01:35.854
Larry, try to stay on topic.
We don't care about the...

01:35.854 --> 01:38.290
- Right? I know. It's not--
- I'm just saying
how cordial I was.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.862
I asked about
the son's piano lessons.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.562
What else you got? Huh?

01:43.562 --> 01:45.598
I tore him to shreds.
I tore him to shreds.

01:45.598 --> 01:48.067
Okay.
I think we're done here today.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.601
Jury, thank you so much
for coming.

01:49.601 --> 01:53.439
Uh, you may exit and deliberate
as if this was a real trial.

01:53.439 --> 01:54.573
We appreciate your time.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.142
And, uh, please fill out
the questionnaires.

01:56.142 --> 01:57.442
It'll help us reach a verdict.

01:57.442 --> 02:00.745
You know, my father fought
in World War II, Iwo Jima.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.448
He wasn't one of the ones
with the flag.

02:02.448 --> 02:03.516
That's fine.
Thank you.

02:03.516 --> 02:05.116
He was encouraging
the flag holders.

02:05.116 --> 02:07.019
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
- Yelled encouragement.

02:07.019 --> 02:09.349
"Go, guys! Go! Up that hill!"

02:09.349 --> 02:13.225
Larry, let's have a little chat
down here really quick.

02:13.225 --> 02:15.594
- Huh? Well?
- How do you feel that went?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.729
Frankly, I'm a little concerned
about one of the jurors.

02:17.729 --> 02:19.398
- Yeah.
- In the garage, he saw me

02:19.398 --> 02:21.466
- tossing my keys to the valet.
- Uh-huh.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.368
I could be perceived
as a big shot.

02:23.368 --> 02:25.104
- Nobody likes a big shot.
- That's true.

02:25.104 --> 02:26.472
- They don't like a big shot.
- Yeah.

02:26.472 --> 02:28.740
But, uh, I wouldn't worry about
this mock trial for that.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.742
Where are you getting
these jurors, anyway?

02:30.742 --> 02:32.978
My assistant gathers them
from the building.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.713
- You know what I think?
- What's that?

02:34.713 --> 02:36.047
I think you ought to
go in there and get

02:36.047 --> 02:37.550
- that guy out of there...
- One second.

02:37.550 --> 02:40.019
...because he's gonna poison
those people.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.720
I got a great text from Abe.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.856
Ah, great.
So everything's worked out?

02:43.856 --> 02:45.658
- Yeah, everything's...
- Beautiful.

02:45.658 --> 02:46.892
Yeah, everything's
been going great.

02:46.892 --> 02:49.228
And what name did you wind up
using for the kid?

02:49.228 --> 02:50.462
Why don't
we leave our professional

02:50.462 --> 02:52.601
and personal lives separate,
you know?

02:53.334 --> 02:55.301
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.236
It was Zeckelman,
wasn't it?

02:57.236 --> 02:58.570
Yeah.
Yeah, it was Zeckelman.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.306
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

03:03.111 --> 03:04.180
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:04.846 --> 03:06.378
Um...

03:06.378 --> 03:09.482
Did you mind me
tossing the keys to you earlier?

03:09.482 --> 03:11.383
Oh, no. No, no, not at all.

03:11.383 --> 03:13.752
- You like a key toss?
- Absolutely.

03:13.752 --> 03:15.488
It's human nature.
We like to catch.

03:15.488 --> 03:16.755
I mean,
that's what I thought, right?

03:16.755 --> 03:19.658
And we like to toss.
People like to toss and catch.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.261
- Right? Yeah.
- Right. Yeah, yeah.

03:22.261 --> 03:23.462
Your car's actually
out in the front.

03:23.462 --> 03:24.730
Do you want me
to get it for you?

03:24.730 --> 03:27.133
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.
I'm happy to get it.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.228
Well, here you go, sir.

03:28.228 --> 03:30.536
- Well, thank you, Rodrigo.
- Oh.

03:30.536 --> 03:33.105
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

03:33.105 --> 03:34.843
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

03:52.560 --> 03:56.262
Um, you got the salad,
but I have a feeling...

03:56.262 --> 03:58.898
you're gonna be
very jealous of this.

03:58.898 --> 04:01.734
- Of the sandwich? Yeah.
- Yes. Well...

04:01.734 --> 04:04.871
I'm not supposed
to be eating sandwiches.

04:04.871 --> 04:06.542
All right.

04:07.175 --> 04:09.676
- Um, listen.
- Yeah?

04:09.676 --> 04:11.576
I'm gonna have back surgery.

04:11.576 --> 04:12.879
- Back surgery?
- Back surgery.

04:12.879 --> 04:14.413
- Really? That bad?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:14.413 --> 04:16.382
Upper back. Yeah, it's been...

04:16.382 --> 04:18.417
- Oh, don't even get me started.
- Okay.

04:18.417 --> 04:21.753
Anyhow, I'm gonna
have anesthesia, obviously.

04:21.753 --> 04:25.528
Three percent chance
something'll happen to me. So...

04:26.527 --> 04:28.795
Susie has the power of attorney.

04:28.795 --> 04:30.662
She's in charge of all of it.

04:30.662 --> 04:33.065
So if something bad
happens to me,

04:33.065 --> 04:34.534
I don't trust her.

04:34.534 --> 04:35.701
You mean she'll...

04:35.701 --> 04:37.869
- she'll pull the plug too fast?
- Pull the plug?

04:37.869 --> 04:39.938
She could do it for any reason.
Who knows?

04:39.938 --> 04:42.274
Uh, maybe on the way there
we get into a fight,

04:42.274 --> 04:44.510
- which is more than likely.
- Right.

04:44.510 --> 04:46.749
So I want you in charge.

04:48.049 --> 04:50.349
Well... okay.

04:50.349 --> 04:51.850
And I don't expect you
to visit me.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.586
I wouldn't know
if you're there or not.

04:53.586 --> 04:55.754
Just come, like,
once a week and take a look.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.523
I might not even come
once a week.

04:57.523 --> 04:58.724
I could just call up.

04:58.724 --> 05:01.394
I'm unconscious.
What the fuck do I know?

05:01.394 --> 05:02.827
How we gonna do this?

05:02.827 --> 05:06.733
We're gonna go to my attorney,
sign some papers, you're in.

05:06.733 --> 05:07.703
Boy.

05:09.304 --> 05:10.636
That sounds real risky.

05:10.636 --> 05:13.005
What if she finds out
we went to this attorney?

05:13.005 --> 05:16.609
Mantle is in the same building
as my attorney.

05:16.609 --> 05:18.645
My lawyer's in the same building
as this guy?

05:18.645 --> 05:20.078
- Yes, indeed.
- Yeah.

05:20.078 --> 05:22.148
- We could say we went to mine.
- We'll say we went to Mantle's.

05:22.148 --> 05:24.783
- Oh, my God, it's perfect.
- If she finds out,

05:24.783 --> 05:26.652
there's no telling
what she could do.

05:26.652 --> 05:28.421
Yeah, well,
she's not gonna find out.

05:28.421 --> 05:29.855
- Find out what?
- Oh.

05:29.855 --> 05:32.758
- Tell her, tell her, tell her.
- Find out-- Find out that I...

05:32.758 --> 05:34.793
- Yeah.
- ...was found guilty.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.762
- In his mock trial.
- In my mock trial.

05:36.762 --> 05:38.297
- Can you believe that?
- What?

05:38.297 --> 05:40.366
Yeah. One of the jurors--

05:40.366 --> 05:41.701
I like you eating a salad, Jeff.

05:41.701 --> 05:42.734
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

05:42.734 --> 05:43.936
It's delicious
and I'm enjoying it.

05:43.936 --> 05:46.505
- Good. Good for you.
- One of the mock jurors?

05:46.505 --> 05:47.539
Yeah.

05:47.539 --> 05:49.942
Saw me tossing keys
to the valet.

05:49.942 --> 05:52.076
And I think
he got offended by it...

05:52.076 --> 05:53.945
- He thought,
"Oh, who's this big shot?"
- ...and influenced the--

05:53.945 --> 05:55.780
- Yeah, like I was a big shot.
- Yeah.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.283
I'm not a big shot.
It wasn't a big shot toss.

05:57.283 --> 05:59.752
Yeah, but you know, Larry,
a toss, you could hurt somebody,

05:59.752 --> 06:01.120
- you could injure them.
- Hurt somebody?

06:01.120 --> 06:03.556
What kind of mutant
can't catch a key?

06:03.556 --> 06:05.252
You better be
very careful right now.

06:05.252 --> 06:06.759
I mean,
that was only a mock trial

06:06.759 --> 06:08.427
that you failed.
Imagine a real trial.

06:08.427 --> 06:11.696
Wanna go to jail in Atlanta,
in the South?

06:11.696 --> 06:13.199
They'll have you
on a chain gang.

06:13.199 --> 06:15.634
Oh. Hello?

06:17.136 --> 06:18.106
Now?

06:20.108 --> 06:21.007
Okay.

06:21.007 --> 06:23.108
- All right, I'll pick you up.
- Who's that?

06:23.108 --> 06:25.677
It's Lewis. He wants
to buy this old Mercedes,

06:25.677 --> 06:27.374
and, you know,
he lost his sense of smell

06:27.374 --> 06:28.513
- during COVID, and--
- Oh, yeah.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.781
And, you know,
sometimes these old cars,

06:29.781 --> 06:32.051
- they have a musty odor to 'em.
- He wants your nose.

06:32.051 --> 06:33.886
- Yeah.
He wants my nose. Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.724
All right, I'm gonna take off.

06:36.791 --> 06:39.158
Hey, you gonna finish
that sandwich?

06:39.158 --> 06:40.026
Eh. Take it.

06:40.026 --> 06:41.660
All right.
Thank you.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.328
Oh, I got this
Vonderdonk cheese.

06:43.328 --> 06:45.597
- Yeah?
- I don't want it sitting
in the car.

06:45.597 --> 06:46.899
Do you mind
if I keep it in your fridge?

06:46.899 --> 06:47.934
- No. Go ahead.
- Huh?

06:47.934 --> 06:49.034
Put it in the cheese drawer.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.670
Okay. I'll pick it up later
or tomorrow.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.074
Yeah, whatever.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.473
All right, see ya.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.912
He sent me a couple
of pictures of the car,

06:59.912 --> 07:01.147
- and it's just so...
- Uh-huh.

07:01.147 --> 07:02.815
It's such a classic
and it's so beautiful, man.

07:02.815 --> 07:04.850
- Wow.
- This is a rare gem.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.051
You like the old Mercedes.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.987
I don't know
how it's gonna really smell,

07:07.987 --> 07:10.423
- so, you know,
you're my nose today.
- Ah.

07:10.423 --> 07:11.823
My nose isn't so great.

07:11.823 --> 07:13.359
Disgusting things
I can smell very well.

07:13.359 --> 07:15.160
- Urine, BO, you know.
- I don't know. I mean, I...

07:15.160 --> 07:16.962
Urine, I can smell
from two blocks away,

07:16.962 --> 07:18.497
but you shove a flower
up my nose,

07:18.497 --> 07:21.770
it does nothing for me.
Hey, um...

07:22.603 --> 07:24.098
you're friends
with Conan, right?

07:24.098 --> 07:25.070
Yeah, for a long time.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.206
'Cause I saw him
in my neighborhood.

07:27.206 --> 07:29.709
Yeah, well, he moved
into that Spanish-looking house,

07:29.709 --> 07:31.109
uh, up on the Circle.

07:31.109 --> 07:34.046
You know, I wanted to go up
and say something to him,

07:34.046 --> 07:36.615
but I didn't want him to think
I was, you know, a nut, so...

07:36.615 --> 07:37.949
- You need clearance.
- I need clearance.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.618
- You need clearance
before you talk to him.
- Yeah.

07:39.618 --> 07:40.987
- Otherwise, you know, my God.
- Right. Yeah.

07:40.987 --> 07:42.421
Could you get me clearance?

07:42.421 --> 07:44.790
- I can get you Conan clearance.
- You'll get me Conan clearance?

07:44.790 --> 07:46.157
- I'll get you Conan clearance.
- All right.

07:46.157 --> 07:49.828
Great. Thank you.

07:49.828 --> 07:51.197
Right? I mean, come on.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.331
- It's mint condition. 1973.
- It's a beauty.

07:53.331 --> 07:55.300
- I've never seen
anything like it.
- There's not a scratch on it.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.802
- It's really something.
- Right?

07:56.802 --> 07:57.970
How you feeling in there?

07:57.970 --> 07:59.505
- Oh, this is a beauty.
- Right?

07:59.505 --> 08:01.474
- This is really gorgeous,
huh, Larry?
- Uh-huh.

08:01.474 --> 08:02.608
Look how good
he looks in this car.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.110
Yeah, don't be too enthusiastic.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.777
- He'll boost the price on you.
- No. No, no.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.279
I bet that's true.
You think he's a booster?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.048
- He could be a booster.
- I think so.

08:09.048 --> 08:10.349
Yeah, he might be a booster.

08:10.349 --> 08:12.951
- But it is beautiful.
- I do not wanna let this car go.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.887
If I wasn't going through
this goddamn divorce...

08:14.887 --> 08:16.756
- Oh.
- She's not getting the car.

08:16.756 --> 08:18.394
What do you think, LD, huh?

08:19.527 --> 08:20.860
How's it feel?
You look great in it.

08:20.860 --> 08:21.961
- Doesn't he look great in that?
- Yeah.

08:21.961 --> 08:24.129
It's got all the original parts.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.765
Oh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go sit in it.

08:26.765 --> 08:29.802
Yeah, yeah.
Try it out yourself.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.537
All right, I'll stop boosting.

08:31.537 --> 08:33.171
Come on. What took you so long?

08:33.171 --> 08:35.808
- What took me so long?
- Yeah,
I'm nodding my brains out.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.809
No, 'cause your head nod
isn't any good.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.444
I didn't know
what you were doing.

08:39.444 --> 08:41.647
- What do you mean
it's not any good?
- You don't have a good head nod.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.916
A head nod,
you're supposed to go like this.

08:43.916 --> 08:45.617
- Huh. Huh.
- Yeah, I did. I went--

08:45.617 --> 08:49.222
No, no, you didn't do that.
You went like this. Like that.

08:49.222 --> 08:52.325
- And you use your eyes too?
- You use your eyes, yeah.

08:52.325 --> 08:56.295
- There you go. There you go.
- How come now you tell me?

08:56.295 --> 08:57.896
Just saying you need to work
on your head nod.

08:57.896 --> 09:01.367
All right, so what do you think
of the car, man? I love it.

09:01.367 --> 09:05.199
What's wrong?

09:07.239 --> 09:08.875
There's a smell.

09:08.875 --> 09:14.080
It smells like tobacco.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.014
- It does?
- Yeah, like...

09:16.014 --> 09:18.952
somebody smoked a lot
of Chesterfields in this car.

09:18.952 --> 09:20.752
What do you think?
It's great, right?

09:20.752 --> 09:24.023
You loving it? Huh?
It's all vintage.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.557
So, what do you think
I should do?

09:25.557 --> 09:26.960
You can't pay full price.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.928
Then I'm gonna ask him
for a discount.

09:28.928 --> 09:30.996
- A smell discount.
- Yeah. Good.

09:30.996 --> 09:33.666
- What's up, guys? We got a deal?
- Hey, listen, man.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.635
I don't think
I'm gonna buy the car.

09:35.635 --> 09:37.035
Why not? What?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.505
- What are you talking about?
- He told me it smells in here.

09:39.505 --> 09:41.040
What are you-- What happened?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.842
You know, he, um...
he brought me along

09:43.842 --> 09:45.478
'cause he's got long COVID
and he can't smell,

09:45.478 --> 09:46.312
and you know, old cars,

09:46.312 --> 09:47.879
they occasionally have
a musty smell,

09:47.879 --> 09:49.482
- and, you know--
- This has a good musty smell.

09:49.482 --> 09:51.350
There's good old musty
and there's bad old musty,

09:51.350 --> 09:52.917
- and this is bad old musty.
- Right.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.486
No, this is an old car smell.
It's good.

09:54.486 --> 09:56.622
- I'm sorry, you know.
- I don't buy that, man.

09:56.622 --> 09:58.157
I'm sorry.
I smell tobacco in there.

09:58.157 --> 09:59.859
Wait, if you can't smell,
what do you care?

09:59.859 --> 10:01.027
It's your car. It's not his car.

10:01.027 --> 10:03.362
Okay, I can't smell it,
but if there's a smell,

10:03.362 --> 10:05.497
then it's gonna be a bad thing
for anyone

10:05.497 --> 10:06.865
who drives in the car with me.

10:06.865 --> 10:09.101
Get one of those, you know,
pine, uh, things that--

10:09.101 --> 10:11.003
Forget the pine thing.
I'll buy the car,

10:11.003 --> 10:13.472
but I want
a 3,000-dollar smell discount.

10:13.472 --> 10:17.310
You know what I smell?
I smell a scam. You come here.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.745
-"Oh, he can't smell..."
- That's ridiculous.

10:18.745 --> 10:19.711
"...but I'm gonna tell him,

10:19.711 --> 10:21.080
'Oh, yeah,
smells like cigarettes.'

10:21.080 --> 10:22.448
Why don't you knock off 3,000?"

10:22.448 --> 10:23.883
- Come-- That's ridiculous.
- I don't think so.

10:23.883 --> 10:25.051
- There's no scam.
- I don't think so.

10:25.051 --> 10:27.286
- It wasn't planned, believe me.
- Oh, come on.

10:27.286 --> 10:29.956
I'm not taking 3,000 dollars
off this car.

10:29.956 --> 10:31.690
No. I offered a fair price,

10:31.690 --> 10:35.161
and if you don't want the car
for that price, then forget it.

10:35.161 --> 10:36.132
Okay?

10:36.831 --> 10:38.998
- Want it?
- No, I don't.

10:38.998 --> 10:40.065
- All right.
- Unbelievable.

10:40.065 --> 10:41.801
What a shit day
this has been, man.

10:41.801 --> 10:43.235
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, Larry.

10:43.235 --> 10:47.576
Hey, things could be worse.
You could have a colostomy bag.

10:53.979 --> 10:55.515
Kiss that car goodbye, huh?

10:56.482 --> 11:01.052
Hey, do you know
if DiCarlo has a colostomy bag?

11:01.052 --> 11:03.990
What? What are you smoking?
What kind of question is that?

11:03.990 --> 11:05.958
Yeah, because I made a bad joke,

11:05.958 --> 11:08.931
and I think I...
I think I struck a nerve.

11:09.997 --> 11:12.198
I'll ask Jeff.
Maybe he'll find out for me.

11:12.198 --> 11:14.170
Yeah, I can't wait
to hear the answer.

11:21.142 --> 11:22.908
I hope we don't run into Mantle.

11:22.908 --> 11:24.276
We'll be fine.

11:24.276 --> 11:26.045
- Yeah.
- Hello, gentlemen.

11:26.045 --> 11:27.650
Good afternoon.
How are we doing?

11:28.617 --> 11:29.816
Oh.

11:29.816 --> 11:31.416
Uh, I'll meet you
by the elevator.

11:31.416 --> 11:33.853
- All right.
- Mr. David. How are you?

11:33.853 --> 11:36.188
- Good. Ah!
- Good to see you.

11:36.188 --> 11:37.622
- So...
- Thank you.

11:37.622 --> 11:39.291
- Okay.
- Yes?

11:39.291 --> 11:42.128
- Oh, you're a valet.
- Yes, I am.

11:42.128 --> 11:43.695
You didn't like it
when you saw me

11:43.695 --> 11:46.132
toss the keys
to Rodrigo, did you?

11:46.132 --> 11:48.334
I don't wanna get into this.
I'm trying to work.

11:48.334 --> 11:51.003
I saw you look askance, though,
when you saw it.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.706
Okay, I thought it was
kind of a big shot move.

11:52.706 --> 11:54.007
Rodrigo likes to catch.

11:54.007 --> 11:56.275
I doubt that.
It's a safety hazard.

11:56.275 --> 11:57.976
You could've--
You could've hit his eye.

11:57.976 --> 12:01.880
Did you influence the other
jurors against me? Huh?

12:01.880 --> 12:04.216
There are two people
in the valet world, sir.

12:04.216 --> 12:06.986
Handers and tossers.
And you're a tosser.

12:06.986 --> 12:08.988
Okay, Victor,
I'll be back in half an hour.

12:08.988 --> 12:10.156
I gotta go sign some papers

12:10.156 --> 12:12.158
so I can kill my friend
whenever I want to.

12:12.158 --> 12:13.325
And when I come back,

12:13.325 --> 12:16.229
I'd appreciate it
if you'd toss me my keys,

12:16.229 --> 12:18.931
and I'll hand you your tip.

12:18.931 --> 12:20.165
Great, I'll keep it close.

12:22.401 --> 12:23.770
If you'll just sign
right there, sir.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.308
- Right there?
- Yes.

12:26.641 --> 12:29.141
- I really like this pen.
- Thank you.

12:29.141 --> 12:32.178
- This is a fantastic pen.
- It... It is.

12:32.178 --> 12:35.848
No, but I... I really like it.

12:35.848 --> 12:38.317
These pens are--
They sign really nicely.

12:38.317 --> 12:41.854
If you'll just place
one more signature right there.

12:41.854 --> 12:44.423
I mean, it's a great pen.
Where do I get a pen like this?

12:44.423 --> 12:48.127
I'm sure you can get that
at any major department store.

12:48.127 --> 12:50.529
You must have
a lot of 'em though, no?

12:50.529 --> 12:52.135
Yeah, we do have a lot.

12:53.968 --> 12:56.235
- Hmm. Okay.
- So congratulations,

12:56.235 --> 12:58.271
you now have
medical power of attorney,

12:58.271 --> 13:00.273
that is the power
to pull the plug.

13:00.273 --> 13:02.976
Oh! You're a dead man.

13:02.976 --> 13:05.211
- Pull that plug!
- Pull it!

13:05.211 --> 13:07.512
Pull that plug, nurse!

13:07.512 --> 13:09.982
Okay, if I may just
have that pen back.

13:09.982 --> 13:11.550
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you. All righty.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.853
Well, we'll have the copy sent
to you very soon.

13:13.853 --> 13:15.855
- Okay.
- Thank you. Take care.

13:17.522 --> 13:19.025
Could you believe
he didn't give me that pen?

13:19.025 --> 13:21.026
- I was shocked.
- That was unbelievable.

13:21.026 --> 13:23.062
He resisted
the "I like it" gambit.

13:23.062 --> 13:24.733
Yeah. Oh.

13:26.701 --> 13:30.773
Oh! DiCarlo had stomach surgery
a few months ago.

13:35.643 --> 13:37.546
Oy, oy...

13:39.808 --> 13:42.949
He's got a bag.
He's got the bag.

13:42.949 --> 13:45.919
Unbelievable. I... I don't know.

13:45.919 --> 13:47.553
I don't know.
What am I gonna do now?

13:47.553 --> 13:50.656
- What do I do?
- Truly, I have no idea.

13:50.656 --> 13:53.092
What can I do for this guy?
Can I buy him a new bag?

13:53.092 --> 13:54.960
Like a really
expensive colostomy--

13:54.960 --> 13:57.162
Like a Louis Vuitton
colostomy bag?

13:57.162 --> 13:58.364
- Do they sell those?
- Do they make those?

13:58.364 --> 13:59.598
- I don't know.
- Do they make those?

14:01.767 --> 14:03.269
<i>What do you think
of my zipper like this?</i>

14:03.269 --> 14:04.503
<i>Do you like this look?</i>

14:04.503 --> 14:06.072
- That's ridiculous looking.
- I kind of like it.

14:06.072 --> 14:07.940
- I don't like it at all.
- Look, it's two zippers.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.608
- You see?
- No, no, but keep the one down

14:09.608 --> 14:10.910
- and play with the top one.
- Yeah.

14:10.910 --> 14:12.681
- Where you guys been?
- Um...

14:13.714 --> 14:15.247
We went to, uh, Mantle's office.

14:15.247 --> 14:16.949
- We went to Mantle's office.
- The lawyer. Yeah.

14:16.949 --> 14:18.084
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, well, you know.

14:18.084 --> 14:19.719
- We went to Mantle's.
- Some stuff to sign.

14:19.719 --> 14:21.286
So, everything go okay there?

14:21.286 --> 14:23.756
- Yeah, yeah, you know,
signed some stuff, and...
- Yeah. Yeah. And by the way,

14:23.756 --> 14:26.191
it went okay 'cause I was there
for a few moments

14:26.191 --> 14:29.395
- that he needed me.
- Oh, you saved the day,
Jeffrey, didn't you?

14:29.395 --> 14:31.030
This has nothing
to do with his career.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.298
You're his manager.

14:32.298 --> 14:35.835
- However--
- Yeah, but I value his opinion.

14:35.835 --> 14:37.136
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:37.136 --> 14:38.504
- At least somebody does.
- You two are something.

14:38.504 --> 14:40.834
You're Frick and Frack,
attached at the hip.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.876
Frick and Frack,
the ice skating team...

14:42.876 --> 14:44.043
- Yes!
- ...from the '30s.

14:44.043 --> 14:45.477
A lot of people don't know that.

14:45.477 --> 14:47.813
- Swedish.
- I think they're Swiss.

14:47.813 --> 14:50.043
- Oh, yeah, Swiss.
- What, is there a difference?

14:50.043 --> 14:51.717
So, you need him?
He doesn't know the difference

14:51.717 --> 14:53.819
- between Sweden and Switzerland.
- He knows the difference.

14:53.819 --> 14:54.887
He got confused.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.189
- All right.
- I gotta pee.

14:56.189 --> 14:57.590
- Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Frick. Yeah.

14:58.757 --> 15:00.892
You underestimate
his intelligence, you know?

15:00.892 --> 15:03.462
But he's a little smarter
than you give him credit for.

15:03.462 --> 15:05.431
I think he's smart.
I don't think he's dumb.

15:05.431 --> 15:06.932
No, let's not go overboard.

15:06.932 --> 15:08.700
He's smarter
than you think he is.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.736
He's not really smart though,
you know.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.575
Ah, he's no genius.

15:15.676 --> 15:18.043
- What are you looking for?
- I'm looking for the cheese.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.979
Oh, it's gone.

15:19.979 --> 15:22.081
- What?
- I ate it.

15:22.081 --> 15:23.415
- You ate the Vonderdonk?
- Yeah.

15:23.415 --> 15:24.783
What do you mean?
Why'd you eat it?

15:24.783 --> 15:26.252
- It's not your cheese.
- Because it's delicious.

15:26.252 --> 15:27.887
It's not your cheese!
It's my cheese.

15:27.887 --> 15:28.954
Well, you left it here
for a day.

15:28.954 --> 15:30.255
I left it here to pick up.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.324
I told you I was gonna
pick it up later or tomorrow.

15:32.324 --> 15:35.328
- This is tomorrow.
- It was in my refrigerator,

15:35.328 --> 15:38.732
and I believe possession
is nine-tenths of the law.

15:38.732 --> 15:40.198
What's the other tenth?

15:40.198 --> 15:42.101
- Fucking over your friends
and eating their cheese?
- Yeah, yeah, I just--

15:42.101 --> 15:43.135
Is that the other tenth
of the law, huh?

15:43.135 --> 15:45.104
- Maybe.
- Let me ask you a question.

15:45.104 --> 15:46.605
If I took a nap on your couch,

15:46.605 --> 15:49.142
could you go through my pockets
and roll me over like a drunk?

15:49.142 --> 15:51.476
You make such a big megillah
over nothing.

15:51.476 --> 15:53.608
It's not over nothing. I went
all the way to Beverly Hills

15:53.608 --> 15:54.747
to pick up that cheese!

15:54.747 --> 15:57.984
Oh, Jeff, he's complaining
that the Vonderdonk is gone.

15:57.984 --> 15:59.488
- Good cheese.
- Yeah.

16:00.454 --> 16:02.955
- You had it too?
- Uh, it was in a sandwich.

16:02.955 --> 16:04.827
Yeah, a melt. I made him a melt.

16:06.227 --> 16:07.526
Who are you people?

16:07.526 --> 16:09.195
You know, I think it's time
for you to leave.

16:09.195 --> 16:11.064
Yeah, you know what?
I think you're right.

16:11.064 --> 16:13.231
I think you're right.
Oh, yes. Yeah.

16:13.231 --> 16:15.935
- You're taking
my pomegranate juice?
- Yeah. I'm taking it.

16:15.935 --> 16:17.669
I'm taking it. It's mine.

16:17.669 --> 16:21.373
I got the pomegranate juice,
and I'm possessing it!

16:21.373 --> 16:24.844
It's nine-tenths
of the fucking law!

16:32.719 --> 16:35.650
Oh! Hey, Conan!

16:35.650 --> 16:38.257
Hey. Uh, Larry David.

16:38.257 --> 16:40.359
- I know, Larry. Yeah. Yeah.
- Uh...

16:40.359 --> 16:42.328
Did Lewis, uh, talk to you?

16:42.328 --> 16:44.796
- No, I didn't hear from Lewis.
- What? Well...

16:44.796 --> 16:48.802
- I... I didn't...
Never heard from Lewis, so...
- Unbelievable.

16:48.802 --> 16:50.235
I specifically called him up

16:50.235 --> 16:51.805
and asked
if he could get me clearance.

16:51.805 --> 16:54.273
He didn't call me, so...

16:54.273 --> 16:58.211
technically, this is
a uncleared conversation.

16:58.211 --> 17:00.412
- It's like an ambush.
- I don't know what to say.

17:00.412 --> 17:02.381
- I'm very embarrassed.
- Yeah.

17:02.381 --> 17:04.283
I'm a little mortified, frankly.

17:04.283 --> 17:05.418
Why would you go up to someone

17:05.418 --> 17:07.319
if you hadn't gotten the okay
from Lewis?

17:07.319 --> 17:08.987
Because I just assumed
that Lewis

17:08.987 --> 17:11.390
- was gonna get the clearance--
- You don't assume
stuff like that.

17:11.390 --> 17:12.658
"Oh, I assume this boat

17:12.658 --> 17:14.726
has plenty of life preservers
for everyone.

17:14.726 --> 17:16.461
Oh, no, it's the Titanic,
it doesn't."

17:16.461 --> 17:18.865
This will go a lot better
once I get some clearance,

17:18.865 --> 17:19.664
- I think.
- Well--

17:19.664 --> 17:22.368
Will you think
about the clearance?

17:22.368 --> 17:24.437
Sure. Yeah, I'll think about it.

17:24.437 --> 17:25.837
Ah. You're not gonna think
about it.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.673
That's just something
people say...

17:27.673 --> 17:30.276
- You know.
- ...when they wanna say no,

17:30.276 --> 17:32.544
and they let the person down
a little easier.

17:32.544 --> 17:34.213
- It's true.
- They say they're gonna
think about it.

17:34.213 --> 17:35.481
I don't know
how many times I say,

17:35.481 --> 17:37.182
"Yeah, I'll think about it,"
and I just wanna get out

17:37.182 --> 17:38.551
of that situation
with the person, yeah.

17:38.551 --> 17:40.085
But you won't spend one second
thinking about it.

17:40.085 --> 17:42.788
Yeah, no. The minute I'm gone,
I'll never think about it again.

17:42.788 --> 17:44.756
- Totally, totally.
- That's a great observation.

17:44.756 --> 17:46.759
- You see, if I had clearance...
- Yeah.

17:46.759 --> 17:48.294
...these are the kind
of observations

17:48.294 --> 17:49.528
you'd be hearing all the time.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.898
You should talk to Lewis.
All right?

17:51.898 --> 17:52.864
- Yeah, yeah.
- We good?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.399
Yeah. Well, look,
you got one of those, uh,

17:54.399 --> 17:57.502
- firehouse dogs, huh?
- He's never been in a firehouse.

17:57.502 --> 17:59.971
- It's a stereotype.
- Can you stereotype a dog?

17:59.971 --> 18:03.109
Yes, you can stereotype a dog.
"Oh, that's a golden.

18:03.109 --> 18:04.843
He must be
a really friendly dog."

18:04.843 --> 18:08.080
"Oh, there's a Dalmatian.
He must live in a firehouse.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.781
He goes to fires."

18:09.781 --> 18:12.351
This is the kind of conversation
I'm trying to avoid.

18:12.351 --> 18:14.220
There's a reason
this protocol's been around

18:14.220 --> 18:18.023
since early sound days,
1932, '33.

18:18.023 --> 18:20.893
I read an article about somebody
approaching Fatty Arbuckle

18:20.893 --> 18:22.093
without clearance,

18:22.093 --> 18:24.730
and Fatty Arbuckle just broke
a beer bottle over his head.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.031
Yeah, it's been a while
since I've heard
a Fatty Arbuckle reference.

18:27.031 --> 18:29.368
What, did you just come
from Margaret Dumont's house?

18:29.368 --> 18:31.970
- Okay.
- Lewis.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.505
Lewis. I thought I had
the clearance. I'll--

18:33.505 --> 18:35.341
There's a system, and we have
a system for a reason.

18:35.341 --> 18:37.610
- I'll go through the system.
- Yeah. Okay.

18:39.907 --> 18:41.684
- Call Lewis!
- Yeah!

18:46.451 --> 18:48.788
You know, anyway,
I just wanna apologize

18:48.788 --> 18:51.123
for the other day
and what I said,

18:51.123 --> 18:54.593
and things just fly out
of my mouth without thinking.

18:54.593 --> 18:55.862
I've done it my whole life.

18:55.862 --> 18:57.829
You say a lot
of stupid things, Larry.

18:57.829 --> 19:01.228
- Not all jokes work.
- Not a joke to me.

19:01.228 --> 19:03.769
I've been going through
some rough times lately.

19:03.769 --> 19:06.172
You know, you know
about my fucking divorce.

19:06.172 --> 19:08.072
- Yeah.
- And all the theaters I owned,

19:08.072 --> 19:09.608
- they're going under. I mean...
- Yeah.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.010
Nobody's coming back
to the theaters.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.039
It's terrible, yeah.

19:12.039 --> 19:14.279
And then health issues,
and I'm...

19:14.279 --> 19:16.382
I don't know, I'm just...

19:16.382 --> 19:18.717
I'm hanging on by a thread,
is what I'm saying.

19:18.717 --> 19:21.187
- And then--
- Okay, you know what?

19:21.187 --> 19:23.655
You know what?
I'm gonna buy the car.

19:23.655 --> 19:25.391
I'm gonna buy it.
I'm buying the car.

19:25.391 --> 19:27.026
- Larry, you don't want this car.
- No.

19:27.026 --> 19:27.994
- I want the car.
- Come on.

19:27.994 --> 19:29.395
- I'm gonna buy the car.
- You wanna buy this car?

19:29.395 --> 19:31.396
I'm gonna buy it.
Yeah. I'm buying the car.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.332
At the price
that I gave to Richard?

19:33.332 --> 19:34.834
- The full price?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.001
- Yeah?
- Yeah, the full price.

19:36.001 --> 19:37.001
You know...

19:37.001 --> 19:40.139
So I drive around,
there's an odor in the car.

19:40.139 --> 19:42.608
That's nothing compared
to what you're going through.

19:42.608 --> 19:43.842
I know what
you're talking about, the smell,

19:43.842 --> 19:46.412
but it's a smell
that you learn to live with.

19:46.412 --> 19:48.714
Yeah, well,
if you can learn to live with

19:48.714 --> 19:52.784
what you're living with,
uh, you know, I could...

19:52.784 --> 19:54.486
I could live with that,
you know?

19:54.486 --> 19:56.992
Yeah, well,
we all got a lot of baggage.

19:59.794 --> 20:00.492
Yeah.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.998
All right. Hey!
Here is your key.

20:04.832 --> 20:07.433
You can Venmo me the money,
all right?

20:07.433 --> 20:09.735
You can drive it out of here.
Get right in.

20:09.735 --> 20:12.537
- You're gonna love it.
- Okay.

20:12.537 --> 20:15.007
Uh... hey, could you
do me a favor

20:15.007 --> 20:17.846
and follow me home in my car,
and I'll pay for your Uber back?

20:18.512 --> 20:19.815
I'd rather not.

20:21.115 --> 20:22.585
Interesting. Okay.

20:24.051 --> 20:26.419
Yeah. Okay.
You'd rather not.

20:26.419 --> 20:29.455
You'd rather not.
I'll come back and pick it up.

20:29.455 --> 20:31.194
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

20:34.062 --> 20:36.199
All good?

20:37.532 --> 20:39.298
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.908
When you're at a red light,
just keep your foot on the gas.

20:46.607 --> 20:48.740
Oh, and that seat belt.

20:48.740 --> 20:50.376
Yeah, you're gonna have
to get that fixed.

20:50.376 --> 20:54.313
- It's against the law.
- Not in 1973.

21:08.329 --> 21:09.929
- Yeah. This is it.
- All right.

21:09.929 --> 21:12.168
- Love that Vonderdonk.
- Oh, good stuff.

21:27.815 --> 21:29.581
Look at the front.
Very presidential.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.016
Look at that.
Look at that grill.

21:31.016 --> 21:32.018
Go ahead. Sit in it.

21:32.018 --> 21:33.889
Let me see how it feels.

21:34.456 --> 21:35.758
Ah.

21:37.558 --> 21:39.458
Okay. This is a White man car
right here,

21:39.458 --> 21:40.459
I'll tell you that much.

21:40.459 --> 21:41.793
Who'd you get it from,
Mr. Peanut?

21:41.793 --> 21:43.629
The motherfucker
with the monocle and a top hat?

21:43.629 --> 21:45.364
- Huh?
- Yeah.

21:45.364 --> 21:47.633
You're right though.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.969
There is a fucking funky smell
in here.

21:49.969 --> 21:51.036
Right?

21:51.036 --> 21:52.738
Like someone's been smoking
for years in this bitch.

21:52.738 --> 21:54.006
- Yeah, it's like...
- Yeah, I know.

21:54.006 --> 21:56.475
That's all I smell.

21:56.475 --> 21:59.278
- Come over here.
- Oh, great.

21:59.278 --> 22:03.049
Hey, did Marilyn Monroe
fuck JFK in a car like this?

22:03.049 --> 22:04.750
- Come here, you bastard.
- What?

22:04.750 --> 22:06.885
- You son of a bitch.
- What? Okay. Can I--

22:06.885 --> 22:09.455
- You son of a bitch.
That's my car.
- Can-- Let me explain.

22:09.455 --> 22:11.656
- That's my car.
- Let me explain, okay?

22:11.656 --> 22:15.761
The guy actually has
a colostomy bag,

22:15.761 --> 22:17.696
- and I felt terrible.
- Oh. Come on. Please.

22:17.696 --> 22:19.865
I felt so guilty and awful,
I had to buy the car.

22:19.865 --> 22:22.368
I'm getting my car back.
This horse shit story is--

22:22.368 --> 22:23.802
It means nothing to me.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.873
- I don't know if it's even true.
- Let me ask you this question.

22:26.873 --> 22:28.507
Why didn't I get clearance
for Conan?

22:28.507 --> 22:29.808
Where was my Conan clearance?

22:29.808 --> 22:31.710
I thought you talked to him.
I had no clearance.

22:31.710 --> 22:33.845
You left me hanging there
like an idiot.

22:33.845 --> 22:36.248
I just want that car.
You owe it to me.

22:36.248 --> 22:38.985
You wanna buy the car?
You can buy the car back off me.

22:38.985 --> 22:41.087
Yeah, but hold on a second,
I want the car,

22:41.087 --> 22:43.289
but I want
3,000-dollar smell discount.

22:43.289 --> 22:45.791
I paid full price.
I didn't get a smell discount.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.293
I mean, there's still an odor
in the car,

22:47.293 --> 22:48.522
isn't there, Mr. David?

22:48.522 --> 22:49.894
You're never gonna smell it.
You got long COVID.

22:49.894 --> 22:51.297
You're not smelling,
you're not tasting.

22:51.297 --> 22:53.365
But I'm making improvements
in all those areas.

22:53.365 --> 22:56.163
- You'll improve your smell?
- Yeah, I might get surgery.

22:56.163 --> 22:57.636
You can't get surgery for smell.

22:57.636 --> 22:59.105
- Yes, you can.
- They got smell surgery?

22:59.105 --> 23:00.839
There's a smell clinic,
but it's in Switzerland.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.009
I'm not sure if I'm gonna go.
But the point is,

23:03.009 --> 23:04.976
I want
the 3,000-dollar discount,

23:04.976 --> 23:06.678
and I want my car,
and that's the end of it.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.443
Okay, fine, but you gotta
drive me to DiCarlo's house
to pick up my car.

23:09.443 --> 23:11.284
Okay, we're gonna go
in my little new beauty

23:11.284 --> 23:12.884
over there, okay, babe?

23:12.884 --> 23:15.120
- Did you babe me?
- I babed you.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.188
Don't babe me.

23:16.188 --> 23:21.893
Do not, under any circumstances,
babe me ever, ever.

23:21.893 --> 23:24.691
You think I feel good about it?
It slipped out.

23:24.691 --> 23:28.371
I'll Venmo you the money.

23:31.805 --> 23:33.773
Hey, I'm just gonna use
the charging station.

23:33.773 --> 23:35.144
Yeah, you're good.

23:42.616 --> 23:44.511
- How you doing?
- Toss?

23:44.511 --> 23:46.618
- Yeah, come on.
- I don't wanna be a big shot.

23:46.618 --> 23:47.987
You're not a big shot.
Come on, toss it.

23:47.987 --> 23:49.555
- All right.
- Awesome. There we go.

23:49.555 --> 23:50.923
- Fun, right?
- It's fun!

23:50.923 --> 23:53.862
- Of course!
- He's a tosser.

23:55.029 --> 23:56.128
<i>All right, so, Larry,</i>

23:56.128 --> 23:57.929
I'm going through
these jury questionnaires,

23:57.929 --> 24:01.067
and, uh, they keep saying,
"Less than cordial."

24:01.067 --> 24:04.498
Um, the word "repugnant"
keeps coming up.

24:04.498 --> 24:07.340
Here's one that says
you're "surly," "petty."

24:07.340 --> 24:09.608
I think we have to maybe...

24:09.608 --> 24:11.978
- We have stuff to work on.
- Yeah,
that's what I'm thinking.

24:11.978 --> 24:13.545
- You know?
- I told you that juror, Vic,

24:13.545 --> 24:14.881
didn't like the key toss.

24:14.881 --> 24:16.048
- I told you that?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:16.048 --> 24:18.484
He could've influenced
all those jurors.

24:18.484 --> 24:20.686
I don't know
that one person like that

24:20.686 --> 24:22.821
can influence
all the other jurors.

24:22.821 --> 24:24.390
- You ever see <i>12 Angry Men?</i>
- Yeah.

24:24.390 --> 24:26.692
Well, one person, Henry Fonda,
influenced the whole jury.

24:26.692 --> 24:28.227
First of all,
this isn't <i>12 Angry Men.</i>

24:28.227 --> 24:30.129
There's one angry man.
He's sitting across from me.

24:30.129 --> 24:31.763
That valet,
he didn't like a catch,

24:31.763 --> 24:33.332
which I don't understand, frankly.

24:33.332 --> 24:34.333
Everybody loves a catch.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.834
- I like a catch if it's fun.
- Of course.

24:35.834 --> 24:36.969
- A catch--
- Catching is fun.

24:36.969 --> 24:38.537
I know,
but not if it's a surprise!

24:38.537 --> 24:41.340
- It could hit me in the face!
- It wasn't a surprise catch!

24:41.340 --> 24:42.341
That's part of the job!

24:42.341 --> 24:44.176
You're a valet, you toss,
you catch, you toss!

24:44.176 --> 24:47.279
No, the part of the job
of being a valet is taking keys,

24:47.279 --> 24:50.516
not having keys thrown at you
all day long.

24:50.516 --> 24:53.819
Look, Larry, can't you see
that there's a pattern here?

24:53.819 --> 24:56.621
You're rubbing people
the wrong way.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.723
Don't you see that?
Susie, for example,

24:58.723 --> 25:00.359
just told me the thing
about the cheese.

25:00.359 --> 25:02.694
You left cheese there
and you're upset

25:02.694 --> 25:05.131
that she ate it?
What is that about?

25:05.131 --> 25:06.632
- You just said it.
- I know, but--

25:06.632 --> 25:07.933
I left cheese in her house.

25:07.933 --> 25:09.734
- Why--
- Vonderdonk cheese, by the way.

25:09.734 --> 25:10.836
- Yeah.
- And she ate it.

25:10.836 --> 25:11.938
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law.

25:11.938 --> 25:13.472
If you leave it there,
it's hers.

25:13.472 --> 25:15.808
Oh, possession!
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard, possession.

25:15.808 --> 25:17.175
- Why? Why?
- What does that even mean?

25:17.175 --> 25:19.278
She took my fucking cheese.
That's what means something.

25:19.278 --> 25:22.615
But you left it there,
so now it's Susie's cheese.

25:22.615 --> 25:24.517
I can't believe
that you're defending

25:24.517 --> 25:25.684
the cheese eater.

25:25.684 --> 25:28.587
You have an issue
with keys and cheese.

25:28.587 --> 25:29.956
You know what else
I have an issue with?

25:29.956 --> 25:31.690
- What's that?
- You.

25:31.690 --> 25:33.958
I want a lawyer
who sides with me

25:33.958 --> 25:36.828
- in the cheese dispute.
- I'm not here to defend cheese.

25:36.828 --> 25:39.265
I'm here to defend
a constitutional issue.

25:39.265 --> 25:42.371
I'm gonna find me a lawyer
who's gonna take my cheese side.

25:48.542 --> 25:49.978
- Hey.
- Yeah?

25:50.244 --> 25:51.443
Catch.

25:51.443 --> 25:54.881
Ziggy Zeckelman!
Not too late!

25:57.718 --> 25:59.855
- Oh, there he is. Hey.
- Hey.

26:00.856 --> 26:02.786
- Huh? That was fun.
- It's fun.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.223
For you.

26:04.223 --> 26:06.691
There you go. Thank you.

26:10.498 --> 26:11.964
Oh, God, Susie.

26:11.964 --> 26:14.903
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

26:17.605 --> 26:19.475
Oh. What the...

26:21.109 --> 26:23.576
It was you! You pulled the plug?

26:23.576 --> 26:24.609
My car's dying!

26:24.609 --> 26:25.778
What an asshole!

26:25.778 --> 26:28.284
Hey, you tossed,
you lost, buddy.

26:31.784 --> 26:33.520
Oh, my God!

26:38.824 --> 26:42.598
Jeff! Jeff, call me!
Jeff, pick up!

26:43.665 --> 26:44.867
Jeff!

26:46.468 --> 26:47.831
Shit.

26:49.036 --> 26:51.604
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

26:51.604 --> 26:56.775
Oh, my God.

27:06.721 --> 27:07.956
What?

27:18.399 --> 27:19.665
Hey! Hey!

27:19.665 --> 27:21.033
Conan! Conan!

27:21.033 --> 27:22.835
- Conan!
- Jesus!

27:22.835 --> 27:24.169
I know, I don't have clearance.

27:24.169 --> 27:25.805
No clearance.
I have no clearance.

27:25.805 --> 27:27.139
My car, the battery died.
My car--

27:27.139 --> 27:29.842
- This is my house.
- No. Oh, I understand.

27:29.842 --> 27:31.643
My car broke down.
It's an emergency.

27:31.643 --> 27:33.279
This is completely unauthorized.

27:33.279 --> 27:35.514
Yeah, can't I get an emergency
clearance exemption?

27:35.514 --> 27:38.517
- There's no such thing!
- You can-- You--
You can make--

27:38.517 --> 27:40.186
You gotta go through the levels!

27:40.186 --> 27:43.887
I can't! It's an emergency!
Can I borrow your car?

27:45.493 --> 27:47.927
If I don't get to Jeff's house,
she's gonna see those papers,

27:47.927 --> 27:49.095
and she's gonna kill us.

27:49.095 --> 27:51.430
You don't know
what this woman's capable of.

27:51.430 --> 27:54.833
All right, I don't know
who these people are.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.969
I'll get you the keys.
You can use the car.

27:56.969 --> 27:59.171
- All right? Yeah.
- What? Oh! Oh!

27:59.171 --> 28:00.372
You got something
on your glasses.

28:00.372 --> 28:01.874
Oh. Oh, thank you!

28:01.874 --> 28:04.009
- That's so nice of you.
- Oh!

28:04.009 --> 28:06.315
- Thank you.
- They're in my pocket.

28:07.448 --> 28:10.082
Ah! My eye!

28:10.082 --> 28:12.985
Why'd you toss?
Who told you to toss?

28:12.985 --> 28:16.122
- It's fun.
- Oh, my God!

28:33.007 --> 28:35.939
We're done here.

28:50.789 --> 28:53.860
<i>So, it turns out DiCarlo
did not have a colostomy bag.</i>

28:53.860 --> 28:55.527
He acted like he had a bag.

28:55.527 --> 28:59.231
How does somebody act
like they have a colostomy bag?

28:59.231 --> 29:00.900
<i>He had this hangdog</i>

29:00.900 --> 29:02.802
<i>"I shit in a bag"
look about him,</i>

29:02.802 --> 29:04.603
<i>and he took me to the cleaners.</i>

29:04.603 --> 29:06.038
How's, uh, how's the car?

29:06.038 --> 29:08.040
<i>It's a beauty
on the inside and out.</i>

29:08.040 --> 29:10.209
<i>And it makes me so happy
that I saved money.</i>

29:10.209 --> 29:11.677
- Hmm.
<i>- And I'm picking up
a beautiful girl</i>

29:11.677 --> 29:14.246
<i>- who's really smart and--</i>
- Oh, what,
you got a date tonight?

29:14.246 --> 29:16.215
<i>She's hip.
She laughs at my jokes.</i>

29:16.215 --> 29:17.949
You know?
I mean, she could be the one.

29:17.949 --> 29:21.653
It's hard to believe
that at your advanced age,

29:21.653 --> 29:25.424
you are still throwing around
terms like "the one."

29:25.424 --> 29:27.960
What, am I supposed to just
give up and crawl under a rock?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.963
Yes! Give up. There's no hope.

29:29.963 --> 29:32.631
Larry, this is my first date
with this woman.

29:32.631 --> 29:34.200
I have such a crush on her,

29:34.200 --> 29:37.003
and I think she's gonna fall
desperately in love with me.

29:37.003 --> 29:38.404
<i>Which asylum are you driving to?</i>

29:38.404 --> 29:40.607
<i>The one in Long Beach
or downtown?</i>

29:40.607 --> 29:42.044
<i>Ciao.</i>

29:51.947 --> 29:55.291
What the hell?
Where the hell's the cheese?

30:17.545 --> 30:18.510
- Wow.
- Hi.

30:18.510 --> 30:20.279
Hiya, beautiful.
Good to see you.

30:20.279 --> 30:22.816
- Good to see you.
- Thanks for coming out tonight--

30:22.816 --> 30:24.817
What?

30:24.817 --> 30:28.453
Oh, God!
It fucking stinks in here.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.022
- What? What are you
talking about?
- Oh!

30:30.022 --> 30:31.357
It doesn't stink in here.
What are you ta--

30:31.357 --> 30:32.892
- Hey, where you going?
- Oh!

30:32.892 --> 30:34.961
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Oh, man!

30:34.961 --> 30:36.996
Hey! Come on back!

30:36.996 --> 30:39.365
Jesus! What the...
What the fuck, man?

30:39.365 --> 30:43.435
Oh, Christ.
