WEBVTT

00:14.597 --> 00:16.474
[Daniel] Cobra Kai
has taken over the Valley.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
[suspenseful music plays]

00:18.560 --> 00:21.730
All that anyone knows now
is Cobra Kai karate.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.191
Terry Silver's karate.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.529
[suspenseful music continues]

00:33.616 --> 00:35.493
[Amanda] New dojos. New senseis.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.081
We may be back in the fight,
but Cobra Kai never left it.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.167
[suspenseful music continues]

00:46.296 --> 00:47.672
[Johnny] If this continues,

00:48.548 --> 00:51.926
all that we fought for
won't even be a memory.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.012
[suspenseful music continues]

00:55.055 --> 00:57.098
[Chozen] Snake grows larger every day.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.520
-What?
-[Chozen] Swallow everything in its path.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.025
-[grunting]
-[Johnny] Something's cooking over there.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.153
We have to make our move now.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.112
[grunting]

01:12.155 --> 01:15.200
[Johnny] If we don't, every kid in
the Valley is gonna be forced to choose.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.243
[suspenseful music continues]

01:17.744 --> 01:19.329
[Daniel] Side with Cobra Kai…

01:20.789 --> 01:23.374
Grand opening of our new location.
You should come check it out.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.628
[Daniel] …or feel the pain.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.216
You dropped something.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.677
[suspenseful music intensifies]

01:35.303 --> 01:36.262
[Anthony yells]

01:36.971 --> 01:39.224
[indistinct shouting]

01:40.391 --> 01:41.476
[Anthony] No! Agh!

01:42.352 --> 01:44.521
[dramatic music plays]

01:46.314 --> 01:48.191
[toilet flushes]

01:48.274 --> 01:50.276
[dramatic music continues]

01:53.238 --> 01:54.197
[music fades]

01:58.368 --> 02:00.912
[Daniel] Another location just opened
in Toluca Lake.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.915
-Silver's dividing and conquering.
-All we gotta do is get our hands dirty.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.502
Pull some skeletons out of his closet.
Know any of his old friends?

02:07.585 --> 02:11.714
[sighs] We've gone down that road.
It, um, didn't go well.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.676
We have to do something. He's got
the damn Valley in a stranglehold.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.302
Silver thinking beyond Valley.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.472
Whatever he's got up his sleeve,
he's keeping it very quiet.

02:19.556 --> 02:23.268
Well, there is… someone who may know.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.854
Someone who knows Silver best?

02:25.937 --> 02:28.064
You're not talking about
who I think you are?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.190
Don't even say it.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.776
To beat a monster,
maybe we need a monster.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.444
I can be monster.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.864
Oh, I bet you'd make a great monster.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.867
But in this case,
only one monster fits the bill.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.827
No. Kreese is locked up.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.122
Hopefully, in a deep dark hole.
I have no interest in crawling into it.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.958
We wouldn't be having this conversation
if we weren't desperate.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.420
Kreese might be our best weapon
if he's pointed in the right direction.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.755
[door opens]

02:53.965 --> 02:55.175
Do any of you work here?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.594
I'd like to buy a car
if it's not inconvenient.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.763
-These guys work here.
-Uh, yeah, you wanna…

03:01.431 --> 03:02.724
-Yep.
-Thank you, honey.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.809
[tranquil music plays]

03:10.315 --> 03:11.733
[Anthony] I don't know about this.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.152
Kenny's been training
a lot longer than me.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.197
-I don't think I can catch up.
-I know you're still upset.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.117
-Kids are calling me shithead.
-We're all dealing with Cobra Kai.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.535
You're not alone.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.664
So, you and Sam back in the dojo.
Game on, right?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.708
Yeah, game on for karate.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.793
Come on. I see you staring at her.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.171
I thought you decided
to keep things platonic?

03:33.254 --> 03:35.298
Yeah, well, she did. He didn't.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.800
Well, uh, you know what they say,

03:38.343 --> 03:41.179
"Put a box of matches
near some fireworks, soon enough…"

03:41.262 --> 03:43.097
[imitates explosion] "Sparks will fly."

03:43.181 --> 03:44.307
Is that what they say?

03:44.807 --> 03:48.228
Something tells me
it's about to be the Fourth of July.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.355
Can't believe that piece of shit's
on our team.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.606
All right. Relax. Okay?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.900
He wants exactly what we want.
Gonna be okay.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.318
[whistles]

03:56.986 --> 03:58.112
[Chozen] Line up!

03:58.196 --> 03:59.030
[speaks Japanese]

03:59.530 --> 04:01.532
[tense music plays]

04:07.789 --> 04:10.041
So where are my dad and Johnny?

04:10.124 --> 04:11.209
Not here.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.420
Today, you train with me.

04:15.964 --> 04:16.965
[speaks Japanese]

04:17.966 --> 04:18.800
Attention.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.885
[speaks Japanese]

04:22.971 --> 04:23.805
Bow.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.144
Cobra Kai gaining ground.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.940
We must prepare.

04:34.023 --> 04:34.857
Come.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.444
This is gonna be badass.
Check out that throwing knife.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.866
Now, we learn about Yanbaru Kuina.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.995
What is that?
Like, some top-secret karate move?

04:47.078 --> 04:48.538
Like a throat rip? [imitates choking]

04:48.621 --> 04:49.914
No. It is bird.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.626
In English called Okinawa rail.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.670
Endangered.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.422
Cannot fly.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.632
Hence, endangered.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.014
So these are the real eggs?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.850
No. Trader Joe's. $3.29.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.102
Take egg.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.064
[tense music plays]

05:15.148 --> 05:16.941
So what do we do with them?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.652
Yanbaru Kuina must protect egg.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.948
From Kume Shima habu. Poison snake.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.034
You must do same.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.290
Begin your preparation.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.000
What are we protecting them from?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.209
From me.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.920
[yells]

05:38.004 --> 05:38.963
[speaks Japanese]

05:39.047 --> 05:40.214
[tense music plays]

05:41.341 --> 05:42.800
Go! Go!

05:44.594 --> 05:46.179
[boy] What's gotten hold of him?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.936
[breathing heavily]
They're really pushing us hard lately.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.356
Seems like we're getting ready
to fight, but

05:58.232 --> 05:59.484
who are we fighting?

06:01.402 --> 06:02.236
[sighs]

06:04.197 --> 06:08.618
Still don't want me here, huh? Why are you
so dead set on freezing me out?

06:09.786 --> 06:12.080
This place is dangerous.
You shouldn't be here.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.041
Are you that scared
of a little competition?

06:15.875 --> 06:19.212
Can't handle the idea of someone
coming after the Queen Cobra's crown?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.963
[tense music plays]

06:21.047 --> 06:21.964
[scoffs]

06:22.799 --> 06:24.175
[tense music continues]

06:24.258 --> 06:25.593
[Kenny grunts quietly]

06:28.096 --> 06:29.389
Hey, slow down, man.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.557
You're making us all look bad. Come on.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.142
Oh. Sorry.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.478
There you go.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.981
Hey, just remember,
I'm number one around here.

06:39.607 --> 06:42.235
You just play your cards right,
you'll be deuces.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.827
[Silver] The only thing
better than a full dojo

06:50.910 --> 06:53.996
is a whole valley of full dojos.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.748
The quantity means little.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.378
For where we go next, we need leaders.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.338
Miss Nichols is a clear leader.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.174
Wouldn't you agree?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.135
She is your best student.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.594
But as a leader,

07:08.678 --> 07:11.305
there is room for improvement.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.811
And she is only one piece of the puzzle.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.898
We must discover
who else can rise to the occasion.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.569
And how do you suggest we do that?

07:24.652 --> 07:27.196
Give them some real competition.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.991
The leaders will rise

07:31.075 --> 07:32.410
or they will crumble.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.579
Oh, I like that.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.747
Yeah.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.710
[Johnny sighs] Can't believe
we're doing this.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.504
You think I wanna be here?
But Amanda's right.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.090
If anyone knows
what Silver's up to, it's Kreese.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.177
Hopefully, this place
has taken him down a few pegs.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.512
Maybe he's ready to talk.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.139
Sure he's had a rude awakening.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.851
Old man in a place like this.
I almost feel sorry for him.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.810
I don't.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.896
I said almost.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.525
[tense music plays]

08:05.776 --> 08:08.237
Hey. So can I, uh,
get you a soda or something?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.865
Maybe something from the vending machines.
We got corn nuts.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.493
-Scram.
-Yes, sir. Sorry, sensei.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.661
[tense music continues]

08:21.125 --> 08:22.376
What the hell is he doing here?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.880
You should be thanking me
for getting you out of your cell.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.257
I don't wanna talk to him.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.343
I wanna talk to you.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.554
Yeah, well,
I don't really wanna talk to you.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.515
Told you this was a dumb idea.

08:35.598 --> 08:40.603
I know there's a lot of bad blood here,
but the fact is, we have a common enemy.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.190
Silver's planning something,
and we need to figure out what it is.

08:44.273 --> 08:48.110
He doesn't know jack shit.
He's been caged up in here the whole time.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.821
I know exactly what Terry's planning.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.366
But if you think I'm gonna help you,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.036
then you two don't know jack shit.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.711
I see many little birds

09:05.795 --> 09:07.255
spread in wind!

09:09.966 --> 09:11.467
Many dead eggs.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.970
[tense music plays]

09:16.472 --> 09:17.473
What are you doing?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.726
This is what birds do to protect eggs.
It's nature's rule, not mine.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.771
You can stay low. I'm going high.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.400
Put it behind your back.
Leaves your hands free to defend.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.569
But I don't know how to use my hands yet.

09:29.652 --> 09:34.323
-Dad didn't teach you wax-on-wax-off?
-Actually, I paid a guy to wash the cars.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.201
It-It doesn't matter.
I'm starting from square zero.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.080
Well, think of it this way.
You used your mind to outwit the obstacle.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.957
[Robby] That's what Miyagi-Do's about.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.834
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
Déjà vu having you back here.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.632
Like what you've done. How many times
did your dad make you sand that deck?

09:51.716 --> 09:52.717
Zero, actually.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.304
-'Cause your dad brought a power sander.
-[Robby laughs]

09:56.887 --> 09:57.888
Ah, sounds like him.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.683
[Sam laughs]

10:00.766 --> 10:03.978
Look at him trying to move in on her.
If you want, I'll kick his ass.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.773
No, you don't need to do that.
Robby and I are cool now.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.610
Besides, I'm pretty sure
they're just, uh, catching up.

10:11.902 --> 10:12.987
[Chozen whistles]

10:14.864 --> 10:17.199
Looks like the Hunger Games have begun.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.369
Luckily, I have eggs-ecuted
the perfect plan.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.205
When I win,
everyone will have egg on their face.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.876
-They'll be shell-shocked. The yolk will--
-We get it. What's your plan?

10:27.585 --> 10:31.547
I'm glad you asked.
I have created a protective covering.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.635
I made it out of my college prep book
for blunt force impact,

10:35.718 --> 10:39.138
and I tied the whole thing together
with an old spool of dental floss

10:39.221 --> 10:41.349
and… my left shoelace.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.935
Yep. It's pretty durable.

10:45.019 --> 10:45.936
[Chozen grunts]

10:50.608 --> 10:53.027
Bird love to hear himself sing.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.155
You sing lonely song.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.991
And now… you are dead.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.620
[Silver] The world is made
of two kinds of people.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.373
Leaders and followers.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.666
Cobra Kai,

11:07.875 --> 11:09.210
like a military unit,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.672
needs both to function successfully.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.009
So… we're gonna divide you up into pairs.

11:17.093 --> 11:22.181
The goal of each pair is to score a point
against an opponent who outmatches you.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.559
Only strong leadership
will allow you to prevail.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.561
Sensei Kim will take the girls.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.482
Boys, you'll stay here
and spar with Sensei Odell.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.734
All right. Split up.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.820
[tense music plays]

11:37.655 --> 11:39.031
Let's get this started.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.243
Our first pair,

11:42.827 --> 11:44.495
a leader and a follower…

11:46.497 --> 11:48.207
Mr. Park, Mr. Payne.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.084
Sir.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.460
Face each other.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.963
Attention. [speaks Korean]

11:54.046 --> 11:56.132
Bow. [speaks Korean] Fighting stance.

11:56.966 --> 11:57.800
Begin.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.970
[Kyler] You want any of this?

12:01.804 --> 12:06.183
All right, little man, you're gonna
go right. Swing when I tell you, okay?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.977
-Swing. Go, go, go!
-[grunting]

12:08.060 --> 12:08.894
[Kenny groans]

12:09.478 --> 12:13.149
Just listen to me, man. I got your back.
But you gotta get in there.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.943
Okay, go low. Aim for his shins.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.487
-[grunting]
-[Kyler groans]

12:18.571 --> 12:20.406
Yo, man. Protect your king!
What are you doing?

12:20.489 --> 12:23.284
Know your role. Stay in your lane.
Come on. We got this.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.369
All right. Enough. Off the mat.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.707
-Damn! We had that shit.
-You didn't do anything. Let me do all--

12:29.790 --> 12:30.666
Sit down.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.626
Next pair.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.586
Lee.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.087
Yes, Sensei.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.049
-Nichols.
-Yes, Sensei.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.387
[tense music plays]

12:54.648 --> 12:55.649
Fighting stance.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.901
-Ais!
-Ais!

12:58.652 --> 13:00.196
[grunting]

13:01.071 --> 13:03.574
Hey, what are you doing?
We work together. Listen to me.

13:03.657 --> 13:07.286
Now you wanna work together?
Stay out of my way. I can get her.

13:08.329 --> 13:13.042
[grunting]

13:14.084 --> 13:15.085
[Devon groans]

13:16.420 --> 13:17.755
[tense music continues]

13:22.551 --> 13:23.469
Go to your left.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.970
[grunting]

13:27.181 --> 13:28.724
[groaning]

13:31.519 --> 13:33.395
[Devon groans]

13:33.479 --> 13:34.772
What was that sound?

13:35.648 --> 13:36.774
Was that pain?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.819
Pain does not exist.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.695
Get off the mat.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.244
Look, if you know what Silver's planning,
why not tell us so we can stop him?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.162
As if you even could.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.374
You've already failed
even after I gave you a lead.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.376
The newspaper clipping.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.795
I should have known it was you.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.215
-Who helped you get that to my house?
-I got my ways.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.553
Well, following it led me into a trap.
Silver blindsided me.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.304
Well, that wasn't my plan.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.182
But it was a nice consolation prize.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.979
Now you know why you can't trust him.
We should leave him here where he belongs.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.565
I don't belong here. I'm innocent.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.526
I'm here because Terry
was tight with the DA

14:20.609 --> 14:22.236
and I couldn't afford a real attorney.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.362
Oh, please.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.200
What if I could help get you out?
Silver isn't the only one with resources.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.411
I can get a lawyer.

14:30.494 --> 14:34.707
Someone who could help get you out,
or, at the very least, a reduced sentence.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.169
If that's true…

14:41.255 --> 14:43.757
then maybe I would tell you what I know.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.510
But I want a top guy,
not one of your greasy cousins.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.054
-You're gonna help him get out of here?
-Johnny.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.350
It's worth the sacrifice.
It's the only way.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.603
I could call my lawyer right now.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.438
Right now.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.607
We got a deal or not?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.067
[suspenseful music plays]

Deal.

[Chozen] Birds of feather

Welcome to the party.

No! No, no!

You want my egg, huh?

Want a piece of the champ?
Come get it, old man.

[Chozen sighs]

16:42.001 --> 16:44.670
-How'd he take you out?
-Shut up. Don't talk to me.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.506
If this is about the mohawk, I'm sorry.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.134
Anybody knows how Cobra Kai
can turn you into an asshole, it's you.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.468
So I'm an asshole?

16:51.552 --> 16:54.930
Yeah, well, let's see.
Uh, you attacked me and Sam at the mall.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.975
Y-You broke Demetri's arm.
Y-You trashed this entire dojo.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.644
Guys! Enough! Enough! All right?

17:00.728 --> 17:05.190
You're both ex-assholes now. Great.
Can we focus on the issue at hand?

17:05.274 --> 17:08.485
There is a madman out there
using weapons on us.

17:09.069 --> 17:09.945
Who's even left?

17:10.446 --> 17:11.613
[tense drumroll]

17:16.035 --> 17:17.828
[tense music plays]

17:17.911 --> 17:18.829
Wait!

17:18.912 --> 17:20.330
Oh God. It's just you.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.248
It's just me.

17:21.331 --> 17:25.377
[exhales] Sorry. Um, I think…
I think we're the last two left.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.755
-Guess so.
-Where's your egg?

17:27.838 --> 17:28.672
Uh…

17:29.631 --> 17:31.091
It's in my pocket. [chuckles]

17:31.175 --> 17:33.302
That doesn't seem like the safest place.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.261
Yeah.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.975
Uh, so, you're back in karate?

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
Yeah.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.687
I'm just as surprised as you are.

17:44.646 --> 17:48.067
I think I just needed to remember
what these lessons are really for.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.653
I'm finally starting
to feel balanced again.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.113
That's, uh…

17:54.114 --> 17:55.741
That's great. I'm happy for you.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.621
I'm not gonna lie, at first it was
a little weird, the friends thing, but,

18:01.121 --> 18:03.499
you know, we have
so many other things going on.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.584
There's no need for extra complications.

18:06.210 --> 18:11.298
I think us not being together helped
Robby and I get along for once, so thanks.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.759
-I'm glad to hear that.
-[Chozen yells]

18:13.842 --> 18:15.219
[Miguel] What? [groans]

[Sam breathes heavily]

18:18.097 --> 18:19.014
[sighs]

18:19.681 --> 18:22.059
If you want that last egg,
you're gonna have to go through me.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.311
[tense music plays]

18:26.980 --> 18:28.565
-This egg?
-What?

18:30.317 --> 18:31.568
[sighs]

18:33.070 --> 18:34.571
One bird in hand…

18:38.951 --> 18:39.952
helpless.

[Chozen sighs]

18:46.208 --> 18:48.085
[grunting]

18:48.168 --> 18:51.171
Come on, man. Dude, block his left. Okay?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.131
[Odell yells]

18:52.214 --> 18:55.467
You're the tip of my spear!
You gotta give me an opening.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.219
-An opening?
-Do I have to do everything?

18:57.302 --> 18:59.680
All you've been doing
is sending me in to get pulverized!

19:01.390 --> 19:05.727
You know what? Screw this, man.
I'm done being a punching bag.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.731
I got a defective follower!
Hey, this shit is mutiny!

19:09.815 --> 19:10.732
[Silver] Payne!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.609
My office. Now.

19:17.030 --> 19:17.990
[sighs]

19:29.251 --> 19:31.128
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny…

19:36.550 --> 19:37.384
Sit down.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.267
Your father, he's in the army, right?

19:47.811 --> 19:50.314
I bet he's a strong leader.
Someone you listen to.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.737
What happened after he was deployed?
Who filled that role?

19:57.279 --> 20:00.073
My brother was the leader
of the house until…

20:00.157 --> 20:01.158
Right, right.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.368
The one in juvie.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.998
And after he went in, who did you follow?

20:09.791 --> 20:10.959
Robby Keene.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.796
And now you're following Mr. Park.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.007
Isn't that the point of the exercise?

20:18.592 --> 20:21.303
I spent a lot of my life
listening to others.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.306
My father.

20:25.933 --> 20:26.767
My captain.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.395
My best friend.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.148
-Sensei Kreese.
-[Silver] Yes.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.818
But it was only
after I listened to my own instincts

20:36.902 --> 20:38.362
that I reached my potential.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.659
I've seen the best fighters in the Valley.

20:45.035 --> 20:45.869
Keene.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.330
Moskowitz.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.248
Diaz.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.127
I believe you have
more potential than any of 'em.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.674
If you're ready to be a leader.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.635
Okay. Look, I hear you.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.679
Okay? But the exercise…

21:04.930 --> 21:07.724
-You said Kyler was the leader.
-Did I?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.144
Or did you assume that?

21:14.356 --> 21:16.733
[exhales] So what do you want me to do?

21:16.817 --> 21:20.195
I want you to stop asking me
or anyone else that question.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.406
[exhales]

21:23.448 --> 21:24.992
[ominous music crescendos]

21:31.707 --> 21:32.791
You want some Jell-O?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.837
-Gabriel.
-[Gabriel] Yes, Sensei.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.588
I don't want anything from you.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.390
Do you really want
to end Cobra Kai, Johnny?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.892
Cobra Kai is not the problem.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.019
It's Silver.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.603
You're just as bad.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.649
Everything I did was for you.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.902
LaRusso and Miyagi,
they took away our chance in '84.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.322
Your chance.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.575
But there's still a way
you can get Cobra Kai back.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.285
Carry on the legacy.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.828
You mean your legacy.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.997
Don't try to sell me some fairy tale.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.169
You wanna know why I'm in this fight?
So I can erase everything you did.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.255
And every mark you left.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.550
Every memory of you.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.385
[door buzzes]

22:28.305 --> 22:29.598
[Daniel] I spoke to my lawyer.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.352
He's willing to help you out.
Here's his number.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.816
First, you got to hold up your end.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.944
Tell us what Silver's up to.

22:51.661 --> 22:52.537
[Kreese sighs]

22:53.705 --> 22:54.790
Okay.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.805
You are not good Yanbaru Kuina.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.518
Snakes will take you down

23:14.601 --> 23:16.603
one by one.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.439
I have tried to tell you what you must do.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.359
But you do not listen.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.695
You must learn to adapt.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.239
Or soon,

23:27.948 --> 23:30.492
you will be extinct.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.369
Take new eggs.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.495
Try again.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.331
[tense music plays]

23:41.586 --> 23:44.756
Sensei Toguchi's real cryptic,
like Mr. LaRusso,

23:44.840 --> 23:46.967
but aggressive like Sensei Lawrence.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.386
It's like the hardest part of both styles.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.221
Can't wait to get our asses kicked again.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.515
Uh, no. No, um…

23:53.598 --> 23:55.517
G-Guys, uh, wait.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.229
He said that the snakes
will take us down one by one.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.773
Right? Just like
he took us down one by one, but…

24:02.858 --> 24:06.528
But what if we weren't a bunch of ones?
Like, what if we were…

24:06.611 --> 24:08.113
-Together.
-Yeah, exactly.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.323
Like, um, a raiding party
in Dungeon Lords.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.366
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24:11.450 --> 24:15.745
Even if you're a level 85, you can't mount
an attack on the grand realm alone.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.206
You need a team.
Everybody has a special role.

24:18.999 --> 24:23.211
The only way we win
is if we work together. As one.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.255
[hopeful music plays]

24:28.300 --> 24:29.176
[tense drumroll]

24:29.259 --> 24:32.888
So we're sure we want
to put all our eggs in one basket?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.599
You're specifically
not supposed to do that.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.517
This is gonna work.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.935
[piercing whistle]

24:39.019 --> 24:42.105
-Oh no, oh no. Oh God.
-Get it together, penis breath.

Has anyone seen him yet?

[dramatic music continues]

25:13.678 --> 25:14.513
[Chozen grunts]

25:15.013 --> 25:18.892
[Sam grunts]

25:18.975 --> 25:24.356
[grunting]

25:25.398 --> 25:29.027
[grunting]

25:29.528 --> 25:30.362
[Chozen grunts]

[grunting]

25:38.119 --> 25:39.913
[dramatic music fades]

[tense music plays]

25:43.333 --> 25:44.376
[grunting]

25:44.459 --> 25:46.461
[tense music continues]

25:57.931 --> 26:00.016
Snake concede.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.102
Dude, it worked!

26:02.185 --> 26:04.145
[cheering]

26:04.229 --> 26:06.356
[triumphant music plays]

26:07.691 --> 26:12.279
This is what we have
that Cobra Kai does not.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.990
Their movement mile wide,

26:15.657 --> 26:17.033
but only inch deep.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.703
But our movement,

26:20.954 --> 26:24.291
inch wide, but mile deep.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.419
Now that you have learned
to work together,

26:28.795 --> 26:31.339
I will teach you
how to master your defense.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.510
Yoshi! Kiotsuke!

26:37.304 --> 26:38.138
Hai.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.518
[grunting]

26:43.602 --> 26:44.436
[Kim scoffs]

26:45.812 --> 26:48.106
Will no one rise to the occasion?

26:49.357 --> 26:51.026
[tense music plays]

26:53.153 --> 26:56.948
You really wanna get back in there?
After we just got our asses kicked?

26:57.032 --> 27:00.452
I'm not afraid of getting my ass kicked
if that's what it takes to get better.

27:00.535 --> 27:04.122
-If we do this, you have to listen to me.
-I've been trying to since I got here.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.666
We're here to fight. Not gossip.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.754
Dominance requires sacrifice. [scoffs]

27:11.379 --> 27:14.924
You would not last one minute
in my dojang back home.

27:15.925 --> 27:18.511
Will no one accept the challenge?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.597
[tense music continues]

27:21.097 --> 27:22.682
We will.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.816
-Fighting stance.
-[both] Ais!

27:32.609 --> 27:34.319
[dramatic music plays]

27:35.236 --> 27:36.112
Go left.

27:36.196 --> 27:40.700
[grunting]

27:41.409 --> 27:42.494
[Devon groans]

27:43.578 --> 27:44.537
[grunting]

27:45.080 --> 27:46.831
[dramatic music continues]

27:48.500 --> 27:53.838
[grunting]

27:55.882 --> 27:57.676
[dramatic music fades]

27:58.635 --> 28:02.138
If you had sacrificed your pawn,
you might have scored that point.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.975
-There are no points in the real world.
-But there are in this exercise.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.811
So you lose.

28:12.315 --> 28:13.191
So close.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.987
-You could have let her get me.
-Wouldn't be a very good leader if I did.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.077
Ready to try again, Mr. Payne?

28:25.370 --> 28:26.246
Mr. Park.

28:27.163 --> 28:28.581
A new strategy perhaps?

28:28.665 --> 28:31.584
I don't know, Sensei.
I might need a new follower.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.253
We'll see for ourselves. Line up.

28:33.837 --> 28:34.713
All right.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.589
[Silver] Fighting stance.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.300
Begin.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.386
-Just follow me--
-No.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.722
What did you say?

28:44.472 --> 28:45.807
We need a change in leadership.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.101
[laughs] You think you can do better?

28:48.184 --> 28:49.269
Yeah, watch me.

28:50.645 --> 28:51.604
Oh yeah?

28:51.688 --> 28:53.022
[Kenny grunts]

28:53.648 --> 28:55.525
Gonna come for the king?
You better not miss.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.776
[Kenny grunts]

28:59.112 --> 28:59.946
Come here.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.866
-All right, enough!
-[Kenny grunts]

29:02.949 --> 29:05.076
[dramatic music crescendos]

29:08.705 --> 29:10.623
-Point.
-Winner.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.754
[Kreese] I remember when Terry Silver
was a skinny little kid,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.088
loaded with fear.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.760
Sort of like the way you were.

29:22.927 --> 29:26.306
Cobra Kai's given him a strength
he didn't even know he had.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.141
He became obsessed.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.853
And he paid for a trip
for us to go back East.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.106
To where the Way of the Fist
first started.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.109
So we could learn from the source himself.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.780
Master Kim Sun-Yung.

29:43.156 --> 29:49.287
[grunting]

29:52.874 --> 29:56.586
[grunting]

29:58.963 --> 29:59.798
[in Korean] Strike!

30:00.882 --> 30:01.800
[grunts]

30:01.883 --> 30:02.842
Again!

30:03.968 --> 30:05.637
[in English] Good hit, Johnny. Good hit.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.555
[grunting]

30:08.223 --> 30:11.309

30:12.143 --> 30:13.645

-[girl gasps]

30:15.230 --> 30:16.397
[vase cracks]

30:18.399 --> 30:20.068
Sorry, Master Kim. My fault.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.069
[in Korean] Again!

30:31.871 --> 30:32.705
[laughs]

30:33.790 --> 30:34.999
[in English] Nice ascot.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.169
I guess business really is booming, huh?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.796
I wanted to talk to you about that.

30:39.879 --> 30:44.133
Well, if you're offering me a board seat,
I'll pass. My focus is on the dojo.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.222
I know.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.725
That's why I bought it for you.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.145
Terry, I…

30:56.646 --> 30:57.897
[Kreese chuckles]

31:00.441 --> 31:01.317
Thank you.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.154
I'll still pay rent. I-I insist.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.155
Don't thank me.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.699
You deserve it.

31:08.908 --> 31:11.327
Cobra Kai is the best dojo in the Valley.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.497
But you can do better than the Valley.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.834
Remember the first time
you told me about the All Valley?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.671
I'm about to do you one better.

31:22.171 --> 31:26.467
It's called the Sekai Taikai.
The top karate tournament in the world.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.970
Barely anyone back in the States
has heard of it.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.055
But with the resources I have now,

31:31.139 --> 31:33.308
we could make this
the Super Bowl of karate.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.020
If we win, Cobra Kai will be everywhere.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.522
Our way will be the way.

31:40.815 --> 31:41.649
[chuckles]

31:42.317 --> 31:44.777
I love that you're thinking big, Terry.
I really do.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.155
But I have to say

31:48.740 --> 31:49.616
no.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.576
But, Johnny--

31:51.659 --> 31:52.785
We aren't ready.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.331
Maybe one day we will be.
Right now, I need to focus on my students.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.958
In fact, there's this, uh… [chuckles]

31:59.792 --> 32:03.004
There's this new kid
I got a feeling about, Terry.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.923
I think he could be our best ever.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.469
He even has the same name as me.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.267
I'll follow your lead, Johnny.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.815
But if you change your mind, need help,

32:23.983 --> 32:25.234
I'll be here for you.

32:29.697 --> 32:33.868
[older Kreese] Silver listened to me
back then. So we didn't expand.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.247
-I wanted to focus on you.
-Don't make this about me.

32:38.331 --> 32:42.585
Hold on. What are you saying?
Silver's gonna enter another tournament?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.337
Not just another tournament.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.674
The biggest tournament in the world.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.969
And if he wins…

32:51.803 --> 32:53.805
Cobra Kai goes global.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.015
[ominous music plays]

32:59.143 --> 33:00.895
[Kreese] Silver has taken the Valley.

33:01.771 --> 33:05.358
Now he's putting together the pieces
to take everything else.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.237
You may have found the will to fight,

33:10.613 --> 33:13.324
but you're outmatched and outnumbered.

33:14.283 --> 33:18.246
Silver is on the verge
of getting what he's always wanted.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.998
[ominous music continues]

33:21.874 --> 33:25.211
Well, I think I've held up
my end of the deal.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.464
The lawyer's number?

33:28.548 --> 33:30.216
[tense music plays]

33:38.391 --> 33:40.393
[dramatic music plays]

33:43.438 --> 33:46.983
You actually think you're gonna be able
to take him down without me?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.610
He's gonna make mincemeat out of you.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.613
We'll see about that.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.574
Enjoy rotting in your cell.
