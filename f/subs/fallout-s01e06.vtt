00:14.166 --> 00:15.750

00:15.750 --> 00:18.250

- Yeah, I understand that,
but that's not really my thing.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.750
What are you suggesting?

00:29.750 --> 00:33.250
We travel together, get the head
and take it to the Brotherhood.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.916

of your knights to save my father.</i>

[Lucy] <i>I wonder if anyone survived.</i>

00:48.625 --> 00:50.333

[fanfare playing]

01:28.583 --> 01:30.041
Oh.

01:30.041 --> 01:31.833
Hello there.

01:31.833 --> 01:34.041
Yep, it's me, Cooper Howard,

01:34.041 --> 01:36.791
star of stage and screen.

01:36.791 --> 01:39.875
But I'm not here today
to talk to you about my latest picture.

01:39.875 --> 01:45.333
No, today I'm here to show you
a vast and wonderful place,

01:45.333 --> 01:49.458
not made by God Almighty
but the working man.

01:49.458 --> 01:52.583
A veritable Camelot of the nuclear age.

01:52.583 --> 01:55.041
Now, how 'bout we turn on some lights.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.416
[soft, rustic music playing]

01:57.416 --> 01:59.541
There, that's better.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.916
Now, I'm speaking to you from
deep inside the fully-livable

02:05.916 --> 02:09.625
Model 96JQ1164.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.875
And what a beaut she is.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.875
And what a song she sings.

02:14.875 --> 02:18.708
Now, that right there
is Vault 4's three-foot-thick lead casing.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.125
Strong enough to keep out the rads

02:21.125 --> 02:23.166
and the Reds.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.208
Each one of these underground burghs

02:28.208 --> 02:30.916
comes with all the modern amenities
you've come to expect

02:30.916 --> 02:33.333
from our rip-roarin' republic.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.750
Now, this corridor here
is Sycamore Street,

02:35.750 --> 02:39.208
where you'll wave howdy
to any one of your 200 neighbors

02:39.208 --> 02:42.791
on your way home for an enchanted evening
with your loved ones.

02:42.791 --> 02:43.916
Mm.

02:43.916 --> 02:45.750
Meet the Hawthornes.

02:45.750 --> 02:49.125
Now, this isn't just your average
all-American family.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.833
No, Lloyd and Cassandra here
are both scientists,

02:51.833 --> 02:55.125
specializing in the effects of radiation
on human DNA.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.458
[Cassandra] That's right.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.583
And we'll be living
and working right here in Vault 4,

02:59.583 --> 03:02.958
leading a community
governed entirely by scientists.

03:02.958 --> 03:04.958
Wait a second,
did you say "living down here"?

03:04.958 --> 03:07.666
Well, there hasn't been
a nuclear incident, has there?

03:07.666 --> 03:08.875
[Lloyd] Uh, no, not yet.

03:08.875 --> 03:13.250
But, uh, our family
and a group of 80 volunteers

03:13.250 --> 03:16.083
will be conducting
a five-year trial of Vault 4.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.375
To demonstrate to the world that,

03:18.375 --> 03:21.041
no matter what comes our way,

03:21.041 --> 03:23.125
America will be ready.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.791
Five years.

03:24.791 --> 03:27.875
Well, I may play a hero
in the movies, but...

03:27.875 --> 03:29.875
you all are heroes in real life.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.375
And now you can be a hero, too.

03:32.375 --> 03:35.666
By purchasing a residence
in a Vault-Tec vault today.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.666
Because if the worst
should happen tomorrow,

03:37.666 --> 03:40.333
the world is gonna need
Americans just like you

03:40.333 --> 03:42.708
to build a better day after.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.583
- [director] And cut.
- [bell rings]

03:44.583 --> 03:47.166
That was a great take. You happy?

03:47.166 --> 03:48.458
Fellas, are you happy?

03:48.458 --> 03:49.875
[chuckling]

03:49.875 --> 03:51.458
All right. Gary, I'm wrapped, right?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.541
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, how'd we do?

03:53.541 --> 03:55.416
- We were so nervous.
- Aw, you did great.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.375
Yeah, it was really lovely to meet you.
Thanks for coming out.

03:57.375 --> 04:00.375
Thank you so much. Good to meet you.

04:00.375 --> 04:02.125
- Mr. Howard, great work today.
- Ah.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.416
Oh, thanks. Thanks, man.

04:03.416 --> 04:06.458
Bud Askins. I oversee
our Southern California operations.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.125
- Ah.
- I, uh, came over to Vault-Tec

04:08.125 --> 04:11.000
in Q3 after a ten-year stint at West Tek.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.375
- [chuckles]
- West Tek.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.958
It's a defense contractor.

04:13.958 --> 04:16.333
Oh, I'm, uh, very familiar with you guys.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.125
You designed the T-45 power armor.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.333
First of its kind.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.458
No, I-I oversaw the-the rollout.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.375
You know, the design flaws
were ridiculous, but...

04:24.375 --> 04:26.416
- they sure looked great.
- I wore the T-45

04:26.416 --> 04:29.791
when we almost lost the great state
of Alaska to the Reds.

04:29.791 --> 04:33.250
Those design flaws of yours cost
a lot of good men and women their lives.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.583
Yeah. Product management was never my bag.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.375
I'm more focused on HR R&D now.

04:38.375 --> 04:41.750
Overseeing workflow optimization
of management timelines.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.041
I'm all about scale.

04:43.041 --> 04:46.166
Most people think scale means
increasing global market share.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.375
That's thinking in three dimensions,
and I'm talking about four.

04:48.375 --> 04:52.375
Because what is the ultimate weapon
to destroy your competition?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.750
It's not outselling them.
It's not outsmarting them.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.083
It's time.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.833
- Hmm.
- Time...

04:58.833 --> 05:00.916
- is the ultimate weapon.
- Uh-huh.

05:00.916 --> 05:03.041
- Yeah.
- [chuckles] Sounds complicated,

05:03.041 --> 05:06.125
but the future of all humanity
comes down to one word.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.416
Yeah, what's that?

05:07.416 --> 05:09.583
Management.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.833
[chuckling]

05:11.833 --> 05:13.791
- Well, I'm awful happy for you, Buck.
- [chuckling]

05:13.791 --> 05:16.458
Bud. Bud Askins.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.041

05:18.041 --> 05:19.916
- Hey.
- Ooh! [chuckling]

05:19.916 --> 05:21.541
[Cooper] Mmm.

05:21.541 --> 05:22.666
I'm at work.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.083
- Oh, how 'bout we clock out?
- [chuckles]

05:24.083 --> 05:25.625
- Oh.
- Huh? Nothing against
these colleagues of yours,

05:25.625 --> 05:29.666
but what do you say you and me knock back
a couple of piña coladas by the pool,

05:29.666 --> 05:31.125
- listen to the hi-fi.
- Mm.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.250
There is a wrap party.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.291
What, a... a wrap party?

05:35.291 --> 05:36.958
- For this?
- Yes.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.458
[sighs]

05:38.458 --> 05:40.916
All right. We go for a couple of hours,

05:40.916 --> 05:42.000
we shake a few hands--

05:42.000 --> 05:43.666
It's at our house.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.500
[sighs] The things
I'm willing to do for you

05:47.500 --> 05:49.791
never cease to amaze me.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.000
Mm.

You can't come, buddy.

06:37.083 --> 06:39.291
Yeah, <i>A Man and His Dog--</i>
that movie's great.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.416
Mm. Yeah. I love that one, too.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.541
It was my real dog.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.166
Beautiful home, Mr. Howard.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.375
Thank you.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.083
[woman 1] Did Cooper Howard just walk by?

06:49.083 --> 06:51.000
[man 1] He was so good in that movie.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.791
[woman 2] Mr. Howard. Hello.

07:07.958 --> 07:11.875
Negotiations in Anchorage are having
a serious impact on presales.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.791
We'll have to circle up with D.C.
about that.

07:13.791 --> 07:16.708
Ideally before our quarterly
projection release.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.000
[laughing]

07:18.000 --> 07:20.750
Mr. Howard. Mr. Howard.

Bud Askins.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.708
Right.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.458
Would you mind, you know,
doing the butler voice?

07:29.458 --> 07:31.083
- From the show?
- All right.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.458
I only do it for close friends
and beautiful women,

07:33.458 --> 07:35.250
but you two are already halfway there.

- Stop it.

am ever ready to serve."

07:40.875 --> 07:42.291

07:42.291 --> 07:43.625
- Hoo-hoo!
- Perhaps

07:43.625 --> 07:46.750
when you finish your shift,
we could head up and party in the hot tub.

07:46.750 --> 07:47.833
What do you think of that?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.875
- Oh, no, no. No, thank you.
- No?

07:49.875 --> 07:51.291
[mutters] Okay.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.500
All right.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.875
Excuse me. Your wine.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.375
Well, shit, Seabass.

You might be the only one of my invites
who actually showed up.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.833
- [grunts]
- Yeah.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.958
- Not our usual scene, I'll give you that.
- No, it is not.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.291
I think our Hollywood actor friends
don't want to be seen

08:08.291 --> 08:11.000
celebrating with the pitchman
for the end of the world.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.375
Oh, you don't know the half of it.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.291
You hear I lost a movie over these ads?

08:15.291 --> 08:17.250
Yeah, showed up to set,

08:17.250 --> 08:19.375
the actors wouldn't
come out of their trailers.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.750
Bonnie Lewis said it was on moral grounds.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.125
Bonnie Lewis?

08:23.125 --> 08:25.375
She's done more ads
than a fucking billboard.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.375
- Yeah.
- Fucking Hollywood Reds.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.958
I'm telling you, radicalism
is sweeping through Hollywood

08:29.958 --> 08:32.291
like a bad case of the clap.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.500
Even got your friend, Charlie Whiteknife.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.000
Are you kidding me? Charlie?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.041
- Mm.
- I served

08:37.041 --> 08:38.416
- with that guy.
- They have meetings

08:38.416 --> 08:39.500
and everything.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.875
It's a shit show.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.166
But you, my friend,

08:42.166 --> 08:44.083
you know which way the wind is blowing.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.208
And it's that--

08:45.208 --> 08:48.333
a world run by people who wear
pocket protectors to a pool party.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.833
[nerd] ...about delivery platforms.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.875
Yeah, you might be right about that.

08:51.875 --> 08:55.083
I mean, I've dipped my bits
in the same gravy train.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.833
Sold my vocal rights to that

08:56.833 --> 09:00.541
spinning robot they sell
to housewives and perverts.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.250
Guess how much they paid me for that.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.708
Ten million?

09:08.416 --> 09:10.333
No, I got 186, pre-tax.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.625
Maybe you could've asked for more.

09:11.625 --> 09:12.750
Well, I did ask for more.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.833
And what did they say?

09:13.833 --> 09:15.916
My agent got them
to throw in one of those robots.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.458
- [laughs]
- The fuck

09:17.458 --> 09:20.041
were they thinking?
Every time I walk into my own house,

09:20.041 --> 09:22.708
my own voice saying,
"Hello, sir, do you want to sit down?"

09:22.708 --> 09:24.958
[laughing]

09:26.125 --> 09:27.333
It's fucking awful!

09:27.333 --> 09:28.750
I thought the studio owned that character.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.250
They did.
And then RobCo bought the studio.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.833
- Mm.
- Listen to me,

09:32.833 --> 09:34.833
Hollywood is the past. Forget Hollywood.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.666
The future, my friend, is products.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.416
You're a product. I'm a product.

09:39.416 --> 09:42.125
The end of the world is a product.

09:42.125 --> 09:43.375
Oh.

09:43.375 --> 09:47.125
And for those of us
who can successfully embrace that,

09:47.125 --> 09:48.666
I'd say the future is golden.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.458
To the future.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.875
To the future.
