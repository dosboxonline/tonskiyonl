Oh, it's a letter from
my fancy private high school.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.007
I'll take this envelope
to the refuse, madam.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.426
Oh, thank you, letter butler.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.554
- What's that all about?
- Oh, it's an invitation

00:54.554 --> 00:56.222
to my high school reunion.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.351
I went to the Fancington's
Academy for Insufferable Girls.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.354
Our mascot was a well-dressed
woman who yells at valets.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.273
Nice. I'm sure you and Peter
will have a great time.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.441
Uh...

01:06.441 --> 01:08.401
Peter.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.115
Nobody look.
This is a private, gross matter.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.747
Right.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.707
Do people bring husbands
to these things?

01:22.791 --> 01:25.085
You're not thinking of going
without him, are you?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.837
Honestly, Brian,
these girls come from old money,

01:27.921 --> 01:30.840
so they can be pretty stuffy
and judgmental.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.009
Well...

01:33.093 --> 01:36.054
I'm still available.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.146
"But the real outliers were the
friends we made along the way."

01:45.230 --> 01:47.440
The end.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.776
- Oh, hey, Lois.
- Wow, look at you.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.611
- Reading a book, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.571
I read everything
people leave on planes.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.407
I read <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>
four times.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.284
And I'm not sure the last time
I've seen you in your uniform.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.578
You really clean up nice.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.126
Hey, Glenn, I have this
class reunion coming up soon,

02:06.126 --> 02:09.838
and I thought maybe it'd be fun
if, I don't know,

02:09.838 --> 02:12.382
you know, maybe the two of us
went together.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.844
- What about Peter?
- Oh, he hates those things.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.637
And football.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.307
- Climate change?
- Well, that is a real problem.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.476
Hey, here's a fun thought:
what if you go

02:23.560 --> 02:25.478
and pretend to be my husband?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.981
Well, I'm not used to wearing
rings above the waist,

02:27.981 --> 02:30.734
but what the hell--
I'll try anything once.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.407
Where you going, Mom?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.617
Oh, I'm just heading out
for the weekend

02:39.701 --> 02:41.411
to visit the...

02:41.411 --> 02:44.414
Museum of Dusty Vases.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.875
Why don't you just look
at all the ones in this house?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.336
So what do we do for dinner?
Like, pizza?

02:49.336 --> 02:52.005
- No pizza.
- Okay, right. So, like, pizza?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.715
No, Peter, not pizza.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.008
Okay, right. Not pizza.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.551
So just... pizza?

02:56.551 --> 02:59.304
Okay, everyone, I stocked
the fridge with healthy food.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.348
Your weight
is a reflection on me,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.016
so no pizza.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.060
Oh, pizza. Now, that's an idea.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.062
Peter, if you disobey me
about the pizza,

03:07.062 --> 03:08.813
there will be consequences.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.899
Mom's-out-of-town consequences,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.318
which, according to the movies,
are the worst kind.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.987
Fine, but I'm gonna tweet
mean stuff at celebrities

03:16.071 --> 03:18.281
that look vaguely like you.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.253
You're going to that reunion,
aren't you?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.963
Shh. Keep your voice down.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.342
Yes, I'm going,
but with Quagmire, not Peter.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.053
Glenn's gonna pretend to be
my husband to impress them.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.097
Are you sure that's a good idea?

03:42.097 --> 03:44.808
I mean, it's Quagmire--
you know how he feels about you.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.185
Yeah, I know he's gonna
try and sleep with me,

03:47.185 --> 03:48.853
but I'm a big girl,

03:48.937 --> 03:51.564
and I can handle Quagmire.
I'll be fine.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.191
- But...
- But nothing. Fetch!

03:53.191 --> 03:55.735
Oh, not cool, Lois.
Very not cool!

03:59.280 --> 04:00.490
All right, she's gone.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.076
Now, who wants pizza?

04:12.877 --> 04:15.880
Oh, no. No wife of mine
carries her own bags.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.216
Oh, my God, that's heavy.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.551
What's in these things?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.219
Well, we're here for two nights,

04:21.219 --> 04:23.805
so my hair dryer,
my iron, my free weights--

04:23.805 --> 04:25.807
and I thought maybe,
if I had a minute,

04:25.807 --> 04:27.058
I'd Rollerblade--

04:27.142 --> 04:29.060
my CPAP machine
and bedside table...

04:29.144 --> 04:30.603
There's a whole table in here?

04:30.687 --> 04:33.523
...travel Peloton,
every robe I've ever owned,

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
and my desktop computer.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.444
It's got my email on there.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.446
Lois, I have
an umbilical hernia.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.573
- They're on rollers.
- Oh.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.492
Okay, so I booked us a suite

04:44.576 --> 04:46.619
so that we can keep up
the appearance of being married

04:46.703 --> 04:48.705
but still sleep
in separate rooms.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.707
Like John Krasinski
and Emily Blunt?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.125
Exactly.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.800
Oh, pizza man's here.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.719
Do I look okay?

05:03.762 --> 05:06.181
I know, that one
has a mind of its own.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.601
Here's your pie.
May I use your bathroom?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.811
Absolutely.
We'll be out here eating pizza

05:11.895 --> 05:13.730
like we're
in an '80s commercial.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.526

05:39.506 --> 05:41.383
Pizza!

05:44.427 --> 05:46.346
It's probably
just the pizza talking,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.556
but I love you guys.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.062
Um, the pizza guy's car
is still running outside.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.523
Four tires,
not one of them the same.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.858
- Is that guy still on the can?
- I'll check.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.068
Let's all check.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.700
I think he's had a heart attack.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.201
He's dead.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.120
Oh, my God, Dad,
this is terrible.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.873
I know. Your mother
is gonna find out we had pizza.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.345
What the...

06:27.429 --> 06:29.639
This is not the room I reserved.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.391
This is the honeymoon suite.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.893
Was that, "This is
the honeymoon," comma, "sweet"?

06:33.977 --> 06:35.437
Or, like, "room"?

06:35.437 --> 06:37.355
Oh, you're not gonna
get away with this.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.149
I am gonna tweet mean stuff

06:39.149 --> 06:41.860
at celebrities
that look vaguely like you.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.126
Whoa, whoa,
I had nothing to do with this.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.003
- Then how did this happen?
- Well, I'm a platinum member

07:00.003 --> 07:01.629
at all the hotel chains,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.798
so they probably just
saw my name and upgraded us.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.842
Well, I don't know
if I'm comfortable with this.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.136
Oh, no problem.
Let me call the front desk

07:08.136 --> 07:10.847
and see if they can switch us
to a room with two beds.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.017
Ah, yes, we were wondering if we
might be able to switch rooms?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.602
Uh-huh. I see.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.063
So just a windowless single
with no water pressure?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.440
No, you know what, it's fine.
We're already here.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.692
My wife says, no, it's fine,
we're already here.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.487
Oh, you heard that.
Okay, thanks, anyway.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.030
But don't get any ideas,

07:27.030 --> 07:29.908
because nothing
is gonna happen between us.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.409
You have nothing to worry about.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.453
I'll be more of a gentleman
than John Wayne Bobbitt

07:33.453 --> 07:35.246
with his second wife.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.248
Hey, honey,
would you take out the trash?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.334
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.548
Love it, love it. What else?

07:45.632 --> 07:48.301
Well, I have been dying to see
that new Rebel Wilson movie.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.595
I hear she raps, like, a lot.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.225
Let's just do this.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.190
Okay, we have to get rid
of this body

08:02.190 --> 08:03.983
so your mom can't
connect us with the pizza.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.527
Anybody got any ideas?

08:05.527 --> 08:07.445
We could put a yarmulke on him

08:07.529 --> 08:08.947
a-and dump him
in the town square.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.615
Pretend it's a hate crime.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.826
Chris, come on.
Where we gonna get a yarmulke?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.994
We should float him
with balloons, like in <i>Up.</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:17.831
Then he's the sky's problem.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.792
- Oh, my God, he got a text.
- Brian, get it.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.379
I'm not fishing it out of his
pants, 'cause I'm into chicks.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.511
Oh, no. This means there
are still undelivered pizzas

08:31.511 --> 08:33.722
- in his car.
- The restaurant's gonna know

08:33.722 --> 08:36.474
ours was the last one he dropped
off before he disappeared.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.602
Oh, my God, that means
Mom will find out.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.938
Which means we got to deliver
the rest of his pizzas.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.524
And we'll leave him and his car
at the last stop.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.318
Well, if we're going in the car,
that means I can take the iPad.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.611
Mom said.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.997
Okay, it's showtime.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.917
Ladies, you're
looking wealthy tonight.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.961
I'd like you to meet my husband.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.130
We're married, hence the rings.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.717
<i>Enchanté.</i>
I'm a pilot and I read books.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.428
This is
Madison Lexington-Broadway.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.722
She runs a scholarship
for underprivileged WASPs

09:15.722 --> 09:17.932
who can only afford Cornell.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.809
My father shoots elephants.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.145
And Vivian Yachtbrunch,

09:22.145 --> 09:25.732
who sailed directly into the
building from Turks and Caicos.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.277
I summer in Antibes,
and I winter in the spring.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.696
And, of course,
Scowly Tight-Anus,

09:31.780 --> 09:35.742
the granddaughter of both
Henry Tight and Randolph Anus.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.995
We were a clipping
on the Jay Leno Program.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.539
May I say that you have
the breasts of an obese woman

09:41.623 --> 09:43.667
and the arms of an anorexic.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.194
Hey, this is a lot of fun
for everybody.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.822
Do you mind if I upstage you
at your job?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.782
Attention, everybody,
this is your captain.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.784
I'm not going to turn on
the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.786
You guys can do
whatever you want.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.083
Now I get it. I'm sorry
I played your saxophone.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.212
God, this car is depressing.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.631
He's got three ashtrays in use.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.010
- Can you put on some music?
- There's no CD player.

10:35.010 --> 10:38.054
Just a Discman
with a cassette plug-in.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.181
You ever heard of a band
called Special Delivery?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.308
Oh, no. It's his band.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.643
Oh, no.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.271
Oh, they're all in uniforms,
God bless 'em.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.773
Aw, dying on a stranger's
toilet seat is bad,

10:48.857 --> 10:49.941
but this is real bad.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.235
Dad, let's get back
to the pizzas.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.904
Right. We deliver the pizzas
and nobody calls the police.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.573
Now, where's our first stop?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.033
The police station.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.044
There are cameras everywhere.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.046
We can't be seen
leaving those pizzas.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.548
But he can.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.383
Good thinking, Chris.
All those in favor

11:15.467 --> 11:17.385
of Meg getting in the dead guy's
clothes with him

11:17.469 --> 11:19.888
and scarecrowing him in,
raise your hand.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.431
Fine, I'll do it.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.600
But only 'cause I'm starved
for human contact

11:23.600 --> 11:25.810
and he's not fully cold yet.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.657
Well, if it isn't Georgie,
my fourth-best friend,

11:39.741 --> 11:41.659
in the weirdly gray flesh.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.454
Haven't seen you
since I ordered that calzone.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.790
Hey, I hate to be the bearer
of bad shoes,

11:46.790 --> 11:48.917
but your sneaker's untied.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.717
Hey, I heard your guitar
got stolen,

11:57.801 --> 11:59.886
so I swiped you a new one
from the evidence locker.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.888
It used to belong
to Martin Shkreli.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.766
Surprisingly soulful balladeer.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.686
Okay, fine, you can play me
a song to thank me.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.483
Hmm, I'm hearing
a little Clapton

12:13.483 --> 12:16.695
mixed with hearing loss from
going to the gun range too much.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.613
We're one short
on the suspect lineup.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.449
Know anyone who could fill in?

12:21.533 --> 12:23.827
<i>JOE
Well, the perpetrator was doing
a highly-choreographed routine</i>

12:23.827 --> 12:25.829
<i>during the assault,
so number three,</i>

12:25.829 --> 12:27.831
<i>please step forward
and perform the zombie dance</i>

12:27.831 --> 12:29.290
<i>from "Thriller."</i>

12:29.374 --> 12:31.292
MEG
Oh, come on.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.211
Five, six, seven, eight.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.556
Whew. That was close.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.933
I'm glad to be done
delivering to places

12:47.017 --> 12:49.019
that are too risky
to walk a dead body into.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.770
What's next?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.564
The cadaver dog
training facility.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.123
I've been waiting for you, Georgie.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.376
I haven't eaten all day.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.013
The pizza guy's having
a secret affair.

13:25.013 --> 13:28.350
Oh, to be single and dead again,
huh, Chris?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.936
Last stop.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.109
I ordered another pizza.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.990
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.660
On your way out, please take
a complementary au pair.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.915
And, of course, au pair
is French for "with jugs."

13:51.915 --> 13:53.875
Your husband is remarkable.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.503
I am hereby changing
his designation

13:56.503 --> 13:59.089
from "charming" to "a triumph."

13:59.089 --> 14:01.174
Hear, hear.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.886
Before you, the one who'd done
the best in our group was Joan.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.222
She was married
to a functioning alcoholic.

14:07.222 --> 14:10.934
All our husbands
were Christmas suicides.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.103
Well, what can I say?
I'm a lucky woman.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.230
By the way, Lois,
when we get back to our room,

14:15.230 --> 14:17.774
you can choose the streaming
service we watch tonight.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.275
Even Crackle?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.152
Eh, even Crackle.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.282
Oh, thanks for being
a great husband tonight.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.576
I mean, when you got
that standing ovation

14:28.660 --> 14:31.121
for comparing the estate tax
to the Holocaust,

14:31.121 --> 14:33.498
I felt like
the belle of the ball.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.917
I really enjoyed spending time
with you, too.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.046
- So...
- So...

14:40.130 --> 14:42.507
<i>He's a good guy.
Let him down easy.</i>

14:42.507 --> 14:45.135
<i>When he goes for the kiss,
just tell him that...</i>

14:45.135 --> 14:47.303
<i>Rose Byrne!
That's the actress</i>

14:47.387 --> 14:48.847
<i>I was trying
to remember earlier!</i>

14:48.847 --> 14:50.849
<i>Always good but never a star.</i>

14:50.849 --> 14:53.226
<i>Okay, I'll text Bonnie
about that later.</i>

14:57.313 --> 14:58.690
I want you...

14:58.690 --> 15:00.817
to meet the cocktail waitress
I'm about to sleep with.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.943
What?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.989
This is Jenna.
You might remember her boobs

15:05.989 --> 15:08.199
from hovering over your shoulder
while pouring wine.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.118
I know I do.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.830
I remember you.
You're the lady

15:13.830 --> 15:16.291
who moved her chair four times
because of the air conditioning

15:16.291 --> 15:19.169
and then asked the band if they
could play a little quieter.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.629
Two maracas. We get it--
you like to shake stuff.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.715
But don't upstage the entrées.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.551
Anyway, we're taking off now.
Enjoy Crackle.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.262
I-I can't believe this.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.098
Well, I guess I could always
go down to the business center

15:32.182 --> 15:35.393
and get passively hit on
by all the losers.

15:35.477 --> 15:38.271
All right, that's one ticket.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.358
Economy plus.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.984
Checking bags.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.235
Several.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.863
Okay, and print.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.824
And... time to go home.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.619
I'm not staying here.
I just don't own a printer.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.671
Oh, look who decided to show up.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.255
Hey, Lois.
That was some night.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.466
You'll be happy to know
I was able to perform

16:06.466 --> 16:09.177
on a four-inch-thick futon
in front of three roommates.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.513
You know, the hotel sent
champagne up for us last night.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.765
Oh, why didn't you send it
to me and Jenna?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.642
Well, no sense wasting it.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.935
Ah...

16:16.935 --> 16:18.937
Hey, did you end up working out
in the morning

16:18.937 --> 16:20.480
like you said you were gonna?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.649
What was it, 40 minutes cardio,
then a Pilates class?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.317
Did you do both of those?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.486
No, I didn't do both of those.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.114
- So just one?
- I did neither of them.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.408
Ouch. Well, thanks again
for inviting me.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.493
This has been fun.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.994
First pee afterwards.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.371
Whoa!

16:36.371 --> 16:39.040
Lois, I'm using all the towels.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.671
♪ ♪

16:44.671 --> 16:46.881
...and then I said,
"Not today, geese,"

16:46.965 --> 16:49.467
and I landed that
passenger plane on the Hudson.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.636
As someone who didn't watch
the news in 2009

16:51.720 --> 16:53.763
and doesn't care
for Tom Hanks films,

16:53.847 --> 16:57.434
that is the most riveting story
I have ever heard.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.103
Ladies and gentleman, this
is your brunch captain speaking.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.564
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,
'cause...

17:02.564 --> 17:03.940
I'm making mimosas.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.984
Only thing bumpy around here

17:05.984 --> 17:07.986
is that strained
airplane metaphor.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.113
What is this,
Mutters Against Drunk Driving?

17:10.113 --> 17:11.948
Lois, have a drink.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.950
Ladies, I took the liberty
of requesting our meal

17:14.034 --> 17:15.952
be soy-free,
meat-free, gluten-free,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.413
dairy-free, cage-free,
carb-free and cruelty-free.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.540
And then I snuck you each
a cinnamon bun,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.959
because all that other stuff's
for Democrats.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.878
Oh, he's wonderful.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.047
Lois, where did you find him?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.923
Oh, you think he's so wonderful?

17:29.007 --> 17:31.468
Last night he screwed
the cocktail waitress.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.933
I'm sorry, ladies.
I have deceived you.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.227
So I'll just collect
my free au pair.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.939
And one for my wife.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.025
And I'll be on my way.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.113
- What is your problem?
- Get away from me.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.406
What's going on with you?

17:53.490 --> 17:55.283
I thought I made
such a good impression.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.037
- We had those ladies fooled.
- Just leave me alone, Glenn.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.164
I did exactly what you wanted.
I didn't make a move.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.791
I didn't even come close.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.043
That's the problem.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.628
You wanted me to?

18:06.628 --> 18:09.923
Well, I... I wanted you to try.

18:11.383 --> 18:12.842
I wanted you to try.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.012
Then I could shoot you down
and feel sexually desirable

18:16.096 --> 18:18.390
and morally superior.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.475
But you're both those things.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.893
Yeah, you say that now,

18:21.893 --> 18:24.396
but last night you were out
boinking that waitress.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.815
Now, how do you think
that made me feel, huh?

18:26.815 --> 18:29.818
It made me feel like
my best years are behind me.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.404
Well, that's not true at all.
I didn't make a move on you

18:32.404 --> 18:34.239
because you're
my best friend's wife.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.242
That... that is true.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.743
Besides, you know me.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.203
I'm not a one-gal guy.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.247
Last night I was with Jenna
for only four hours,

18:42.247 --> 18:43.915
and I cheated on her
with the woman

18:43.915 --> 18:45.500
who was fixing the ice machine.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.502
Hands were a little cold,
but we got there.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.878
I used that ice.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.880
Hopefully before 2:30 a.m.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.340
Look, if you wanted a decent guy

18:52.424 --> 18:54.342
who's only been into you
and only you,

18:54.426 --> 18:55.844
you should have brought Peter.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.304
You know what? You're right.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.432
So what if he drinks too much?

19:00.432 --> 19:02.434
So what if he weighs too much?

19:02.434 --> 19:04.936
So what if he thinks
Scrappy-Doo is the better Doo?

19:05.020 --> 19:08.148
He's a loyal husband
and a good man.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.776
Oh, I should never have been
embarrassed to bring him.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.279
And I shouldn't need
the attention of another man

19:14.279 --> 19:17.115
- to feel sexy and young.
- That's right.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.702
Hey, why don't we continue
our discussion in the shower?

19:20.702 --> 19:22.120
A little wet-à-tête.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.456
How dare you?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.916
And thank you.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.261
All right,
Lois is gonna be home soon,

19:38.345 --> 19:39.554
so we got to fix this now.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.389
Why don't we just
shove him in the sewer,

19:41.473 --> 19:43.016
let the clowns have at him?

19:43.016 --> 19:46.144
I'm good with anything that
keeps Pennywise off my jock.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.896
Sounds like a plan.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.735
Hold on, Peter.
This feels wrong.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.987
We can't just dump him
facedown into raw sewage

19:56.071 --> 19:58.156
without saying a few words.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.783
You're right, Brian.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.451
I'll do the honors.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.247
It feels like just yesterday

20:06.331 --> 20:09.250
when he came into our lives
carrying a pizza we bought.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.294
I always loved how
he looked around the house

20:11.378 --> 20:13.088
a little too much while I was

20:13.088 --> 20:14.756
digging the money
out of my wallet.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.425
And who can forget
his license plate number:

20:17.509 --> 20:20.011
7-G-something-something-5.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.639
More sweat than you're
used to seeing on a fella,

20:22.639 --> 20:25.266
but that's what
moisture-wicking shirts are for.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.937
His nails were dirty,
but his heart was pure.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.731
Okay, time to drop him
in a river of dung.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.778
He's stuck!

20:36.778 --> 20:38.446
Oh, crap, it's Lois.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.491
Peter, what the hell
is going on?

20:42.784 --> 20:44.077
You ordered pizza, didn't you?

20:44.077 --> 20:47.122
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, I don't care.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.707
I love you, Peter.

20:48.707 --> 20:49.833
Mm.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.751
And I have a confession for you:

20:51.835 --> 20:53.920
I went to my high school reunion
this weekend,

20:54.004 --> 20:56.089
and I didn't invite you.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.465
What?

20:57.549 --> 21:00.510
Thank you.
Oh, thank you!
