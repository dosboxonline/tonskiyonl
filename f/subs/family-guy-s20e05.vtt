doing laundry and drinking beer.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.207
I'm sorry.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.793
Doing laundry and drinking beer?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.296
Quahog welcomes Duds & Suds,

00:46.379 --> 00:48.256
a new Laundromat that serves beer.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.300
So, if you want to drink
and watch your kid's teacher

00:50.383 --> 00:53.386
wash his only pair of pants,
get on down there.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.180
- Ah, cool!
- We should go.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.848
Nothing better
than putting on a warm diaper

00:56.931 --> 00:59.142
right out of the dryer.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.279
Aah, I'm okay! Let's go again.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.490
Shut up! Shut up!

01:13.573 --> 01:14.657
What's the problem?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.950
What day is it?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.327
Wednesday?

01:17.410 --> 01:20.038
Aka the one day a week
I have independent study

01:20.121 --> 01:22.207
first period and get to sleep in.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.708
So shut up!

01:23.792 --> 01:26.878
Stewie, when I was over
visiting Grandma and Grandpa,

01:26.961 --> 01:28.588
humiliating myself to ask them

01:28.672 --> 01:30.340
to keep paying for your preschool...

01:30.423 --> 01:32.592
I know you don't understand me,
but I understand you.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.719
...I found Chi-Chi!

01:34.803 --> 01:36.846
He's like your doll, Reuben.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.306
I know, I know, I know.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.767
You called Joanna "Joanne"
the other day, it happens.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.228
He was always very special to me,

01:43.311 --> 01:46.481
now I want him to be very special to you.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.941
What is she even talking about?

01:48.024 --> 01:50.318
- Toy.
- Toy? Oh, oh, toy.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.237
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.739
- Yay, toy.
- Yay, toy!

01:54.823 --> 01:56.116
- Shut up!

01:56.199 --> 01:57.742
I'm so sorry, Chris.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.994
I forgot it was Wednesday.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.205
Oh, sorry.
Where are my manners?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.416
Chi-Chi, this is Reuben...
uh, Rupert, Rupert.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.167
I-I meant-I meant Rupert.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.544
You know that.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.050
I know it's not ideal that he's here,

02:14.134 --> 02:15.552
but I can't just throw him out.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.845
Lois would be crushed.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.014
She has, like, nothing in her life.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.473
Of course I saw his Bible,

02:20.557 --> 02:21.975
that's the first thing I saw.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.111
Hey, check it out.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.612
You and Peter have the same undies.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.739
What are you talking about?

02:35.822 --> 02:36.906
He just wears run-of-the-mill Hanes.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.408
Yours aren't Hanes?

02:38.491 --> 02:39.826
No, mine are Planes.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.369
All pilots wear them.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.996
Planes.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.874
"The perfect underwear
for unexpected wind shear."

02:45.957 --> 02:48.376
- Is that, like, farts?
- Yes, that's, like, farts.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.051
Oh. Hello, Doug.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.927
- Can I sit here?
- I don't care.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.429
My stop is next.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.681
I assume you're taking this
to the end of the line?

03:01.765 --> 03:04.351
Out to the land of cheap rents
and tract housing?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.102
My stop's pretty soon, too.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.354
What's on your shoes?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.939
Oh. These are called laces.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.609
I doubt you've ever heard
of them, Mr. Velcro.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.903
I know about laces.
I've just never seen black ones.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.529
Geez. Why are you always such a dick?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.198
Takes one to know one.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.325
Where did you learn that? That's great.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.118
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That-that wasn't about you.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.536
I-I'm just...

03:23.620 --> 03:25.497
There's-there's stuff going on at home.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.874
I'd love to hear about it,

03:27.957 --> 03:30.752
I know little
of lower-middle class plight.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.838
Eh, it's just this new stuffed
monkey Chi-Chi's making waves

03:33.922 --> 03:35.256
with my old stuffy.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.841
I keep trying to get rid of the monkey,

03:36.925 --> 03:38.051
but my mom keeps finding him

03:38.134 --> 03:39.844
and I can tell you're bored.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.638
Far from it, Stewie. I feel for you.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.890
That actually sounds like
what I'm going through

03:43.973 --> 03:45.600
- with Miss Tiggywinkles.
- Really?

03:45.684 --> 03:48.728
Yeah. It's really wearing on me.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.316
Hey, I just had a crazy idea.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.318
We might be able to help each other out.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.611
How's that?

03:56.695 --> 03:59.114
two fellas meet on a train,

03:59.197 --> 04:01.199
and do each other's murders.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.202
I kill Chi-Chi,
you kill Miss Tiggywinkles.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.287
Nobody could ever connect us
to the crimes.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.414
Crisscross.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.499
You've got yourself a deal.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.129
Great. Well, this is my stop.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.047
No, no, no! You can't!
You can't. That's hot lava.

04:16.131 --> 04:18.508
Whoa!
That was close.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.021
Giggity morning, everyone.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.314
Lois, can I see you
in the other room for a second?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.150
- Sure.
- All right.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.447
Peter, what would you like for breakfast?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.032
Chocolate chip pancakes.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.784
Lois, can I see you
in the other room for a second?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.706
So... Whew.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
Uh, what did you want?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.251
- Uh, wa-waffles?
- Yeah, sure.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.795
Lois, can I see you
in the other room for a second?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.093
I couldn't perform a third time,
so we just read.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.976
Morning, beautiful.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.770
I had the Uber guy sleep outside,

05:11.853 --> 05:13.480
so he's ready when you're ready.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.448
But first, a dump so long
I will be able to read

05:23.531 --> 05:26.076
everything Garfield ever wrote.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.121
Jon.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.125
Morning, Captain Quagmire.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.544
Hey, did you know
if this plane was a wiener,

05:36.628 --> 05:38.755
we'd be the wiener's eyes?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.632
Hello, this is your captain speaking

05:40.715 --> 05:43.343

Ugh, God, Stewie's so basic.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.140
Oh, my God, he did it.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.101
Oh, no!
I've been out all morning

07:15.185 --> 07:17.395
with lots of witnesses, and now this.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.980
Chris! Help!

07:19.064 --> 07:21.274
For God's sake, what now?

07:21.358 --> 07:24.611
So, I was out on my walk
with Jane, Ally P., and Ali R.--

07:24.694 --> 07:26.696
both got disastrous haircuts yesterday,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.365
obviously that stays in this room--

07:28.448 --> 07:30.325
and I just came in
and found Chi-Chi like this.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.410
Stewie, do you know what day it is?

07:32.494 --> 07:34.704
It's the next Wednesday.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.916
I believe you're aware
of my Wednesday schedule.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.751
First period, independent study.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.628
Oh, so you are.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.755
And do you remember what I like to do

07:43.838 --> 07:46.174
during first period, independent study?

07:46.257 --> 07:47.801
- Sleep.
- Sleep.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.761
Oh, you're a quick study.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.222
-(bleep)!

07:52.305 --> 07:54.557
Chris, your alarm is going off!

07:54.641 --> 07:57.602
I know!

08:10.281 --> 08:12.784
All right, time to murder
Miss Tiggywinkles.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.704
Oh, never been invited to Doug's before.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.289
Whoa! Chalkboard wall?
No way.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.084
The only limitation is my imagination.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.134
So fun.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.679
Stay right here, Miss Tiggywinkles.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.472
Dougie will be home soon to play.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.451
Beat it.
You don't want to see

08:54.534 --> 08:56.411
what I'm about to do to Miss Tiggywinkles.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.256
Get away from me n...

09:10.842 --> 09:12.510
Oh, my God.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.846
- I can't read.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.850
- Here you go, Miss Tiggywinkles.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.104
Miss Tiggywinkles is a real cat.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.900
You know what?
I can do this.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.876
I can't do it.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.920
I can't kill a cat.

09:47.003 --> 09:50.256
Unless you were in the movie musical
with Rebel Wilson?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.342
I can't do it!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.681
<i>We now return to</i> Baywatch.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.307
All right.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.434
There he is-- the reason our lawn

10:01.518 --> 10:03.019
looks like it has leopard skin pants.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.479
What's up with you lately?

10:04.562 --> 10:05.939
You've been acting really weird
all of the sudden.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.108
"All of <i>the</i> sudden," Brian?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.527
I think what you mean
is "all of <i>a</i> sudden."

10:10.610 --> 10:13.363
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's the author in the house.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.532
What's your problem?
Why are you being such a jerk to me?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.908
My problem with you?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.034
Let's see, where do I begin?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.286
You accept food, clothing and shelter,

10:20.370 --> 10:21.996
yet no responsibilities.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.082
You constantly want to sleep with my wife,

10:24.165 --> 10:25.500
who is an angel.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.168
Oh, and the hypocrisy.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.254
You claim to be an ally to women,

10:29.337 --> 10:31.840
but I bet you don't even know
Nancy Pelosi's official title.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.009
Sure, I do.
She's, uh...

10:34.092 --> 10:36.011
Chuck Schumer's secretary.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.097
Forget it, Brian. Now, can you
strap me to this milking table?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.433
My wife will be home soon.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.105
Stewie Griffin,

10:47.188 --> 10:49.399
do you want to tell me
why you didn't hold up

10:49.482 --> 10:51.651
your end of the bargain
with Miss Tiggywinkles?

10:51.735 --> 10:53.653
Seriously?
Maybe because you failed

10:53.737 --> 10:55.905
to mention she was a real, living cat.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.574
Hey, I killed your monkey.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.159
Don't you see how that's different?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.494
We had a deal.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.204
No, I know.
I-I... But I just...

11:03.288 --> 11:04.539
I d-I don't... I don't think...

11:04.622 --> 11:07.167
Boy, this is really gonna
hurt your reputation

11:07.250 --> 11:09.627
with my kindergarten friends.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.379
You have kindergarten friends?

11:11.463 --> 11:12.672
Oh, yeah.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.550
I let them throw pinecones at me
all the time.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.887
But now I'm gonna have to
tell them you welshed on me.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.265
Kindergartners hate welshers.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
Kindergartners, eh?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.935
You know what?
I'll do it.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.062
Good choice, Stewie.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.938
Hey, m-maybe after all this is done,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.900
I-I could get kindergartners
throwing pinecones at me?

11:31.983 --> 11:34.027
Whoa, slow down, champ.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.363
They start you at driveway pebbles.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.411
Ah, Brian, just the man
I was hoping to see.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.121
You don't like cats, do you?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.706
- I hate 'em.
- Sit.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.252
Three of Lois' sweaty jogging bras.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.463
Have I really been that good of a boy?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.423
Depends.
I got a cat problem.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.133
You get rid of my cat, this is all yours.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.302
- Done.
- Go ahead, boy.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.723
Oh, yeah.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.393
She ran fast because Bonnie was watching.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.899
- What happened to you?
- I'm not really sure.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.318
I was in line at the bank,
and this human-sized chicken

12:15.402 --> 12:16.695
cut in front of me.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.238
Well, I wasn't gonna let that stand.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.447
I had a weird day, too.

12:19.531 --> 12:20.990
I asked, like, seven people

12:21.074 --> 12:23.118
if they were gonna watch
the SpaceX launch.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.703
And I-I don't even know what that is.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.996
Hey, you two are both acting very strange,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.832
and I think I know what it is.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.085
He's wearing your underwear
and you're wearing his.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.253
How do you know that?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.796
Well, you know, when some people go blind

12:34.879 --> 12:36.506
their other senses are heightened.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.718
When I lost my legs,
I gained a sense of underpants.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.012
What are you talking about?
We didn't switch underwear.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.722
Oh, are you sure about that?
Stand up

12:43.805 --> 12:45.682
and let Jojo flip your taggies.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.809
Turn around.
Butt-to-butt.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.563
Hanes.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.773
Planes.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.943
Whoo!

12:57.027 --> 12:58.278
What the hell?

12:58.361 --> 12:59.612
We must've accidentally
grabbed the wrong ones

12:59.696 --> 13:00.697
at the Laundromat.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.158
Oh, so your boys were

13:03.241 --> 13:04.659
where his boys were.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.120
And your boys were where his boys were.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.790
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.500
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.502
Peter and Quagmire exchanged underwear.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.171
Ha! Classic.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.922
Me, I don't wear underwear.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.883
I just wear trunks.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.384
Tree guy.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.927
That'll hit you when you're driving home.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.723
Hey, look at this table.
What are you guys talking about?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.858
Oh, hey, I-I, uh...

13:36.941 --> 13:38.985
I didn't-I didn't know
you take out trash, too.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.696
Yeah, I-I, uh...
O-Only on trash days.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.740
No, right, of course.
Yeah, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I...

13:45.492 --> 13:46.951
I'm not sure what to say.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.703
I know. It's awkward.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.663
I thought things would go back to normal

13:50.747 --> 13:52.499
after we traded underwear yesterday.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.767
I'm gonna have Lois
cancel our dinner plans

14:10.850 --> 14:12.143
with you and Ida tomorrow.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.770
I-I think it's too soon.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.272
Hey, you don't think the guys
are talking about us, do you?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.482
Oh, I don't think so.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.025
Oh, my God.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.069
I still can't believe they
wore each other's underwear.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.821
Like, can you imagine?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.072
I know, right?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.699
Like, icky times a thousand.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.242
Hey, this is crazy,

14:27.325 --> 14:30.036
but what if we wore
each other's underwear,

14:30.120 --> 14:31.663
- just for a joke?
- What?

14:31.746 --> 14:33.373
No, that's a terrible idea.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.958
Yeah, just-just joking.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.501
So stupid!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.461
Can I be done now?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.970
Okay, you go in there, kill Miss T,

14:47.053 --> 14:48.304
and we'll sneak out the back.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.639
You need a weapon or anything?

14:49.723 --> 14:52.183
She's a cat, I'm a dog.
I'm good.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.950
It went poorly.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.540
Thanks again for having us over, Lois.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.335
Zesty Italian?
Oh, I-I just couldn't.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.919
Not this close to bedtime.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.880
You said you were gonna cancel dinner.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.257
I have zero control in my marriage.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.054
Whoops.
I dropped my roll,

15:29.137 --> 15:30.847
which is not at all
an invitation for Peter

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
to have an under-the-table conference.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.027
Ha. Darn thing's always coming off.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.695
Excuse me for one moment, won't you?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.950
- Why did you do that?
- You dropped all the bread.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.203
- What was I supposed to do?
- Okay, that makes sense.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.039
So, I went to the underwear doctor and...

15:56.122 --> 15:57.749
you should probably get checked.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.417
They say when you wear
someone's underwear,

15:59.501 --> 16:00.919
you're also wearing the underwear

16:01.002 --> 16:02.587
of everyone whose underwear they've worn.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.089
I can't believe this.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.633
I thought I knew you, Glenn Quagmire.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.555
Here I go again, filling up on ears.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.932
What's going on here, you two?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.475
You're being very rude.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.103
Lois spent all day overcooking this meal.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.772
We accidentally wore
each other's underwear.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.736
I can't believe you wore
each other's undies.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.656
This is hysterical.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.157
Shut! Up!

16:31.241 --> 16:32.951
Oh, it's not even Wednesday.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.619
It's Tuesday night!

16:34.703 --> 16:36.079
That's part of it!

16:36.162 --> 16:37.664
Guys, this isn't funny.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.041
Relax, Peter.
It's no big deal.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.167
You don't get it.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.086
Oh, quit being so dramatic.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.213
Ladies switch underwear all the time.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.756
I might be wearing Bonnie's right now.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.174
I don't even remember.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.969
While that is super sexy
and being stored for later,

16:51.052 --> 16:52.721
it's very different for guys.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.597
That's not true, male friends can be

16:54.681 --> 16:55.932
more intimate than they used to.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.684
Nope.
- And the lines of sexuality are

16:57.767 --> 16:59.102
- more fluid than ever.
Nope.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.021
And people aren't so quick
to judge or label.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.524
- Please stop.
- Masculinity just doesn't
account for stuff like this.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.901
Look, guys can share laughs and beers,

17:06.985 --> 17:09.863
but we don't share feelings,
emotions or underwear.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.615
Between male friends,
there's no coming back from this.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.910
He's right. I'm afraid
our relationship is on the skids.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.579
Maybe there's hope for the future,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.080
but things now are too spotty.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.749
I just don't know if there's
any front-to-back to this.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.542
Our reputations are smeared.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.836
If I wasn't so yellow,
maybe I'd push harder.

17:24.919 --> 17:28.089
But, hey, we had
a really good streak, huh?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.930
What's going on out there, Dad?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.766
We accidentally wore
each other's underwear,

17:37.849 --> 17:39.517
so Mr. Quagmire is moving.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.810
Oh, wow.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.896
Yeah, obviously, one of you would need to.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.315
Peter, this is completely ridiculous.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.484
Babe.
What's done is done.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.152
Look, I don't have a lot of friends,

17:49.235 --> 17:51.279
it's kind of a problem on the show.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.491
But if I did, I would never
let anything come between us,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.785
especially a pair of underwear.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.040
You know what, Lois?
You're right.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.084
Now go tell him not to move.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.125
Quagmire,

18:45.208 --> 18:47.585
I just want to say that you can
wreck a good pair of underwear,

18:47.669 --> 18:49.713
but you can't wreck a good friendship.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.297
That's nice, Peter.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.174
Underwear should never
come between two friends.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.634
Well, it kind of should.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.511
Yeah, yeah. It kind of should, yeah.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.471
Will you help me move my stuff
back inside?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.098
Only if I can do it half naked

19:00.181 --> 19:01.391
and in front of all our neighbors.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.351
Not my first choice, but okay.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.667
Miss Tiggywinkles, wake up.

19:27.751 --> 19:28.918
You've got to get out of here.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.424
Oh, my God, you're dead!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.344
- Well, what do we have here?

19:37.427 --> 19:40.096
Stewie Griffin, cat murderer?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.890
What?
You psycho.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.224
You killed her?

19:43.308 --> 19:46.269
Maybe I did, maybe she died
of natural causes.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.687
The only thing that matters is

19:47.771 --> 19:50.106
that now I have the goods on you.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.861
Oh, that's a terrible photo.
Would you mind doing it again?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.703
Aw, yeah.
That's cute.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.038
- Can you send me that?
- No.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.457
Give me that picture!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.042
Hey, Doug.
Sorry about your kitty.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.045
I guess the pet store didn't
have a men's department, huh?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.756
Uh, well, I tried to get a...

20:16.299 --> 20:17.801
Hey, I don't want to be
too tired to drive home.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.135
Does this story have an ending?

20:19.219 --> 20:20.637
Later, losers.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.222
I'm five.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.308
- Who is that?
- That's Tyler.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.602
He's, uh, kind of my Doug.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.187
Boy, we all get a Doug, huh?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.564
Yeah, Tyler's Doug is a drunk stepdad.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.484
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

20:39.531 --> 20:42.367
Well, I'm glad everyone's
back in their regular underwear

20:42.450 --> 20:44.077
and everything's back to normal.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.370
Me too.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.372
And thank you for cleaning
the milking table.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.165
Well, we had quite a week as well.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.458
We sure did.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.043
I mean, you got your ass kicked by a cat.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.753
Well, it was really more of a draw.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.797
Yeah, whatever.
Hey, you want to end the show

20:55.880 --> 20:57.298
with a "To Be Continued" meme?"

20:57.382 --> 20:58.883
I-I don't even know what that...
