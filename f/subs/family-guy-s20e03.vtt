Happy Halloween, kids.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.545
Happy Halloween.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.006
Look, it's Matt Foley
from <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

00:48.089 --> 00:50.759
I don't know who that is.
I just came from a meeting at work.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.177
Oh, good. Peter, you're home.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.845
You can help me pass out candy.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.306
Sorry, Lois, I have
to go do a dangerous speedball

00:56.389 --> 00:59.601
and become the least surprising
death in Hollywood history.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.567
Happy Halloween, Meg.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.487
Wow, Mayor West. That's some costume.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.530
Well, thank you kindly.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.657
It-a me, Borat!

01:14.741 --> 01:16.659
You know, from that picture <i>Borat.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:18.411
You ever seen it?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.747
Yeah, that movie came out,
like, 15 years ago.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.540
Well, I'd never heard of it,

01:22.624 --> 01:25.460
but it was just about
the funniest thing I'd ever seen.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.462
Anyway, have a good evening.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.589
My wife!

01:33.635 --> 01:34.969
"This is my costume"?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.888
Come on, put in some effort.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.516
Guys, just 'cause you showed up,
doesn't mean you get an apple.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.476
- Apple?
- We're here for candy.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.103
Kill yourself.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.105
There's a lot of sugar in an apple.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.190
If you saw the numbers, you'd be shocked.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.858
Trick or treat.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.070
Wow, that's the first <i>Frozen</i>
I've seen in 35 seconds.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.155
Oh, my God, I love your pilot costume.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.658
Thank you. I'm actually
John Travolta walking

01:56.741 --> 01:58.618
into my backyard airport in Florida

01:58.701 --> 02:00.620
to fly a passenger jet all by myself.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.831
That's right, I'm just a regular guy.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.332
Your daughter is adorable.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.334
Oh, she's not my daughter. She's my niece.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.169
My sister and her husband ran into someone

02:08.253 --> 02:11.089
having an adult Halloween party
and didn't have an excuse ready.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.340
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.050
Yeah, it was really tough for them,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.219
but I said earlier, "I'm not gonna cry,"

02:16.302 --> 02:18.388
so I'm not gonna cry.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.515
And hi. My name's Carrie.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.559
Hi, Carrie. My name is Glenn.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.561
It's really nice talking to you, Glenn.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.814
- You, too, Carrie.
- Hey! Candy!

02:27.897 --> 02:29.774
Hey, Brian, check it out.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.071
This might be my biggest candy score ever.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.073
Probably thanks to my killer costume.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.491
What are you dressed as?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.035
I'm the "Oh, my God" reaction GIF.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.249
And people get that?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.876
Yeah. Everyone's dressed as GIFs.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.002
Ain't that right, Pop?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.678
Wow. This place is great, Glenn.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.680
Yeah, they can really microwave eggs here.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.932
You know, I'm so glad
you trick-or-treated at my house.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.475
I finally found someone

03:04.559 --> 03:06.811
I can just say names from <i>Succession</i> with.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.813
I mean, oh, my God, Kendall?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.566
- Kendall! And Shiv?
- Love Shiv.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.068
- And what about Roman?
- Yes.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.695
And Logan.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.405
- Oh, Logan.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.865
Oh, look at that dog.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.867
Yeah, who brings a dog to a coffee shop?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.536
- I love dogs.
- Without letting me pet it.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.788
Come here, you... dog.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.874
Oh, isn't he so sweet?

03:27.957 --> 03:29.709
Oh, good boy.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.794
Yay, my hand smells like you now.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.881
Oh, I'm so happy you're a dog person.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.466
I don't think I could be with someone

03:36.549 --> 03:38.176
who doesn't love dogs as much as I do.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.802
Yeah, it's great we like the same things

03:39.886 --> 03:41.221
as soon as you say what you like.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.097
So, what kind of dog do you have?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.350
Well, uh, uh, what kind of dog?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.352
Um... you know, I-I've never noticed.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.520
I... I'm... I'm more attracted
to his spirit.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.147
Oh, they're so special.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.899
And you know
what's right around the corner?

03:52.982 --> 03:54.817
The strip club
where they spit in your face?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.694
No, the dog park.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.696
For our next date,
we should bring our dogs there.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.657
Next date?
Absolutely.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.159
- Oh, and cousin Greg.
- Cousin Greg.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.620
Cousin Greg.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.542
Phew, that tummy time was killer.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.253
Totally blasted my core.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.129
But I think that earns me a little treat.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.881
What the deuce?

04:16.965 --> 04:18.591
This bag was full last night,

04:18.675 --> 04:20.051
and now half of it's gone.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.970
Oh, my God, I've been robbed!

04:27.016 --> 04:29.310
Rupert, check the jewelry box,
see if anything's missing.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.229
"An engagement ring"?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.106
Oh, ha-ha, very funny, but not the time

04:33.189 --> 04:35.566
to have this conversation--
we've been burgled!

04:37.068 --> 04:39.862
Well, looks like they only stole
some of my Halloween candy.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.614
But they're not going
to get away with this.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.658
Like the fat man when he plays Clue.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.702
Okay, the murderer was "don't care,"

04:45.785 --> 04:47.245
with a "this game sucks"

04:47.328 --> 04:49.455
in the "I regret having children."

04:49.539 --> 04:52.041
<i>Clue--
<i>you got someone pregnant nine years ago,</i></i>

04:52.125 --> 04:54.502
<i>so now you have to play this.</i>

04:58.923 --> 05:00.842
Thanks for coming with me, Peter.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.260
I need a dog for my date,

05:02.343 --> 05:03.636
but I don't know
the first thing about 'em.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.555
No problem, Quagmire.
But just know

05:05.638 --> 05:07.223
I'm gonna spend most of the time here

05:07.307 --> 05:09.475
finding the courage to hold an iguana.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.768
Here he is.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.312
I'm not sure I'm ready.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.399
Uh, excuse me, how much is that one?

05:16.482 --> 05:18.484
Oh, he's a purebred Bichon Frise,

05:18.568 --> 05:20.486
so he's $1,500.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.406
For a dog?
Um, and-and what's your return policy?

05:23.489 --> 05:25.700
Is it, like, full money back
within ten days?

05:25.783 --> 05:27.994
Sir, if you're not interested,
I have to comb feces

05:28.077 --> 05:30.204
out of the guinea pigs' hair
with a wet paper towel.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.623
Go ahead, you can touch him.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.877
It's dry.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.174
Sorry we couldn't get you a dog.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.509
Come on in, we'll have
however many beers it takes

05:43.593 --> 05:45.636
to forget how depressing the shelter was.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.931
I'll go get those aforementioned beers.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.142
Thanks, word-a-day calendar.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.314
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.899
Mm.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.525
I mean, mmm, there he is!

05:59.609 --> 06:01.527
Brian the dog.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.905
What's going on here?
Why are you using my full name?

06:03.988 --> 06:05.656
All right, let's cut to the chase.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.158
I like chases.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.910
Okay, look, I'm seeing this woman,

06:08.993 --> 06:10.787
and there's something different about her.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.247
I mean, it's not just that
the sex is great, which it is,

06:13.331 --> 06:15.375
but I appreciate her as a person,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.710
which sounds kind of weird
coming out of my mouth.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.213
Anyway, I told her I have a dog, so...

06:20.296 --> 06:22.298
would you pretend to be my dog?

06:24.759 --> 06:27.512
Well, well, well.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.182
Well, well, well.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.602
Well, well, well.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.771
Brian, come on, I'm serious.
Will you help me out?

06:36.854 --> 06:38.398
Glenn Quagmire, there are not enough

06:38.481 --> 06:40.691
tennis balls in the world for me to...

06:40.775 --> 06:42.443
- I have six.
- I'll do it.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.703
Thanks for doing this, Brian.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.205
And remember, just act like a normal,

06:54.288 --> 06:56.207
well-behaved, non-talking dog.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.376
- Non-talking?
- Yeah, just bark and stuff.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.420
Bark?
Geez, it's been a while.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.754
Let me give it a try.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.047
Brack.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.924
Brack?
What the hell is that?

07:05.007 --> 07:06.426
- I'm finding it.
- Damn it, Brian.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.593
I knew you were gonna
screw this up for me.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.095
I thought you wanted to help.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.472
Help? I'm not doing this
because I want to help.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.516
I'm only doing this
so I can have a front-row seat

07:13.599 --> 07:15.101
when you crash and burn.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.894
Okay, first of all,
it's incredibly insensitive

07:16.978 --> 07:19.063
to say "crash and burn" to a pilot.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.565
And, second, how dare you?

07:20.648 --> 07:22.692
How dare you, Brian the dog?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.735
You know I'm right--
you're gonna get tired of the sex

07:24.819 --> 07:26.279
and then you'll move on to the next one.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.697
Oh, 'cause you know everything, right?

07:27.780 --> 07:28.948
Well, you're wrong, Brian.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.491
Okay, shut up, here she comes.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.952
Hi, Glenn.
This is Dexter.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.288
Aw, and who's this little guy?

07:35.371 --> 07:38.207
Uh, uh, this is... Harvey.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.376
Named after Weinstein, uh...

07:40.460 --> 07:43.421
'C-Cause you can see his balls
when he answers the door.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.840
I may be dating myself, but in the '90s,

07:45.923 --> 07:48.259
the funniest thing you could do
was show people your balls.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.678
C-Can you start talking now, please?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.263
Sorry, I couldn't hear you

07:52.346 --> 07:53.806
'cause my dog was licking my ear.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.225
Oh, thank God.
This is my dog, Bob...

07:56.309 --> 07:57.727
Weinstein.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.103
He's man's best friend

07:59.187 --> 08:00.646
because he's very good at keeping quiet.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.024
Do you mind if I take
five minutes in the parking lot?

08:03.107 --> 08:05.651
This is Spot.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.908
All right, Rupert,
when the thief comes back

08:11.991 --> 08:13.326
for the rest of my candy,

08:13.409 --> 08:15.411
he'll have to deal
with my latest invention.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.289
Hey, Stewie, what are you d...

08:18.372 --> 08:20.541
Aah! Aah! Help!
Somebody help me!

08:20.625 --> 08:23.085
I won't survive on the inside.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.254
Thief! I've caught you!

08:25.338 --> 08:27.131
Chris?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.549
Stewie, get off.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.635
I haven't been stealing your candy.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.512
- Dad has.
- The fat man?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.972
He did the same thing to me
when I was younger.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.558
The only way to keep him
away from it is to hide it.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.060
And that's why I'm here.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.561
I'm gonna help you.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.855
Really?
You'd do that for me?

08:42.939 --> 08:44.815
Of course, Stewie.
We're family.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.609
We look out for each other,

08:46.692 --> 08:48.402
like the people on <i>Succession.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:51.280
Well, don't leave me hanging like that--
throw out a name.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.533
- Tom.
- Oh, Tom.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.660
Can you believe Tom?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.957
Carrie's gonna be here soon.
Can you give me a hand getting

09:01.040 --> 09:03.626
- this cat stuff out of here?
- Where is your cat, anyway?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.920
I don't know.
No cat owner knows where their cat is.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.421
Okay, but I still don't know why

09:07.505 --> 09:09.173
you're going through all this trouble.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.967
I mean, you're just gonna bail
and leave her in the dust.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.511
- Hey, how's your son, Brian?
- Whoa!

09:13.594 --> 09:15.888
What happened to DEFCON four,
three, and two?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.056
- Okay, she's here.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.141
Get off the couch.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.770
- Who is it?
- It's <i>The Purge.</i>

09:22.853 --> 09:24.814
- We're here to beat you up.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.902
Coming up, one pizza
with alternative crust.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.904
Oh. Yummy, yummy.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.865
Alternative crust pizza
is really good, Brian.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.576
You can't taste the difference.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.494
What aren't you lying to yourself about?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.079
Okay, you want to know the truth, Brian?

09:40.162 --> 09:41.914
Brian the dog?
I love her.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.749
You hear me?
Love.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.419
This is priceless.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.670
I haven't had this much fun

09:47.753 --> 09:49.297
since I went to that graveyard.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.593
- Yeah, how do you like
how this sounds, huh?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.971
Try cleaning up this mess
while you burn in hell.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.056
- Peter, you ready to go?
- Almost.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.267
- What do you mean you don't like that?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.644
Just try it, maybe you will.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.774
Thanks again for having us over, Lois.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.318
Everything was so delicious.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.320
Oh, my pleasure, Carrie.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.155
Yeah, I've got to say, Glenn,

10:14.238 --> 10:16.407
I've never seen you this happy before.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.743
Well, then you've never
seen me at my best before.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.828
And it's all thanks to Carrie.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.373
Aw, not at the dinner table.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.584
I'm sorry, Peter,
I just can't help myself.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.210
I'm crazy about this woman.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.425
Huh?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.810
-"Will you marry me?"
- What's this now?

10:44.894 --> 10:48.147
Oh, my God, Glenn, yes.
Yes, of course I'll marry you.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.940
Mmm...

10:50.024 --> 10:51.192
Mazel tov!

10:51.275 --> 10:53.277
Mazel tov?
Where did that come from?

10:53.361 --> 10:57.073
From Marvelous Mrs. Mazel Tov.
Y-you should know that, Lois.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.491
Mmm.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.497
Engaged?

11:04.580 --> 11:07.750
Aw, come on, Quagmire,
you're killing me, man.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.377
Babe, babe, please...
Babe, please stop crying.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.254
Look, every couple
needs to take things at their own speed.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.674
It doesn't mean I love you any less.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.510
Okay, look-- how about
we look at rings this weekend?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.512
I-I don't know.
Zales, probably?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.431
Well, that's what we can afford
since only one of us has a job.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.309
Ugh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.646
"Why don't you join me for dinner?"
he said,

11:28.729 --> 11:30.648
ruining his life.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.242
There he is, the bridegroom to be.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.328
That's right, the very happy
bridegroom to be,

11:44.412 --> 11:46.497
singing to himself.
♪ <i>Dat-da-dat-dee</i> ♪

11:46.580 --> 11:48.040
♪ <i>Da-dee-dee, da-dee-dee!</i> ♪

11:48.124 --> 11:49.583
Oh, come on, give it up.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.419
You're out of moves.
Checkmate.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.170
Hi, honey, we're home.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.755
Will you help me move in his dog food,

11:54.839 --> 11:56.716
like we're preparing for a flood?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.928
Dexter eats all this?

12:01.011 --> 12:03.264
Not just Dexter, but Dexter and all

12:03.347 --> 12:04.807
his rescue brothers and sisters.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.101
Oh, my God, how many are there?

12:07.184 --> 12:10.438
Hmm, enough to do a slow pan
with music from <i>Airplane.</i>

12:25.536 --> 12:28.080
Is-is that one just a back half?

12:28.164 --> 12:31.000
Oh, Backsy? Yeah. She's a fighter.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.127
Well, maybe she should stop fighting.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.045
Okay, I'm gonna go
bring in all their meds,

12:35.129 --> 12:37.173
and then I'll set
the 19 different feeding alarms

12:37.256 --> 12:39.717
on your phone. Mm.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.968
- Shut up!

12:41.051 --> 12:42.219
I didn't say a word.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.805
I'm just...
I'm just thrilled you're getting

12:44.889 --> 12:46.474
all the happiness you deserve.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.893
I am happy.
<i>Parade</i> magazine says

12:48.976 --> 12:51.395
owning a dog is the secret
to having a happy life.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.189
You read <i>Parade</i> magazine?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.357
If you know a better magazine
for ordering plates

12:55.441 --> 12:57.401
with people's faces on them,
I would like to hear about it.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.198
Hey, babe,
was the Princess Diana plate important?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.659
Brian, can you hand me
that <i>Parade</i> magazine,

13:05.743 --> 13:08.579
that envelope, that stamp
and that checkbook?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.831
Thank you.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.336
Who are we waiting for, Chris?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.046
I called in some professionals.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.757
They're gonna take us somewhere
Dad'll never find your candy.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.967
- And where's that?
- I can't say.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.928
There are ears everywhere.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.805
Good morning, Mr. Feldman.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.057
Morning, Chris.
Couldn't help but overhear

13:28.140 --> 13:29.934
you're off on a little trip.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.937
Never mind about that, Mr. Feldman.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.397
See?
I could hear that.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.067
Get in.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.785
You know, I should really
be in a backwards-facing car seat.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.413
They're now saying kids through eight

13:51.497 --> 13:54.166
should at least be in a booster seat.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.836
- You have any kids?
- Don't make small talk with these guys.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.045
No, no, it's all right.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.588
It's nice to have someone
ask for a change.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.216
Yes, I have four children, all dead.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.801
Ah.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.015
Well, here we are.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.060
Quick, hide your candy in the tree.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.520
Is this our backyard?

14:14.603 --> 14:17.940
Yes. But we couldn't
take a chance of being followed.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.913
Son of a... I'm pinching and lifting.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.180
Oh!

14:51.181 --> 14:53.893
Hey, if you're making coffee,
I'll have a...

14:53.976 --> 14:55.144
Whoa, kind of a mess in here.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.021
It's fine.
Everything is fine.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.898
I'm happy and in love.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.025
Damn it, Brian, did you leave
the doggy gate open?

15:01.108 --> 15:03.485
- No, no, no, stop it!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.446
Peppy, you're allergic to Frankie's food.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.947
Malcolm, stop humping your brother.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.240
Backsy, outside.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.366
Babe, can you give me a hand

15:09.450 --> 15:10.868
moving my furniture

15:10.951 --> 15:13.454
all around the room
until I find a place I like for it?

15:13.537 --> 15:15.331
Kind of in the middle of something, babe.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.625
Ah, the seven-hour itch.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.293
Shut up, Brian.
Why don't you go for a walk?

15:19.376 --> 15:20.794
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.046
No walk! No walk!
No, no.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.339
We're not going for a walk!

15:23.422 --> 15:24.423
I got to stop saying "walk."

15:24.506 --> 15:26.884
I said walk again.
And there again.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.011
Honey, I want to make a stir-fry tonight.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.638
- Have we unpacked the wok?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.973
No, no, w-O-K.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.059
W-O-K! She said wok.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.019
She said wok!

15:37.102 --> 15:39.188
She said wok...

15:54.536 --> 15:57.122
My candy-- it's all gone.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
Even my West Hollywood candy.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.169
My Twinx bar.
My very Milky Way.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.004
My Reese's Penis.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.006
Who's done this to me?

16:06.090 --> 16:09.259
Who's taken candy from a baby?

16:16.100 --> 16:19.019
Well, we did it.
Cheers.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.271
We sure did, Chris.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.482
- Cool iguana.
- He's dry.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.150
I named him Arid.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.445
Thank you, word-a-day calendar,
travel edition.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.289
Just met some of Carrie's friends.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.750
They are very excited for her.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.253
- Well, they should be.
- Well, they should be.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.796
And they are.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.882
Anyway, expectations are high.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.970
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to our engagement party.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.264
And an extra thanks to my airline buddies

16:55.347 --> 16:56.473
for organizing it.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.934
Uh, folks, our party time tonight is

16:59.018 --> 17:01.020
two hours and 48 minutes.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.855
We know you have lots of choices

17:02.938 --> 17:05.899
for terrible weekend activities,
and we hope to see you soon

17:05.983 --> 17:09.111
on an inconvenient weekend
for their destination wedding,

17:09.194 --> 17:12.865
which I hear is on a Thursday
in Lisbon, Portugal.

17:12.948 --> 17:13.907
That's so far!
Come on!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.284
Yep. Yep.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.369
It's been wonderful meeting
all of Carrie's family

17:17.453 --> 17:19.246
and friends.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.707
I only wish you were all wearing nametags.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.334
Isn't he adorable?

17:24.418 --> 17:25.961
My expectations are high.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.130
You know, I first met Carrie and her niece

17:28.213 --> 17:30.174
a couple of weeks ago on Halloween.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.259
Thank God they decided to take that walk.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.804
And now we're headed down the aisle--

17:35.888 --> 17:37.431
a very different kind of walk.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.894
And, Carrie, if I may borrow a line

17:41.977 --> 17:43.437
from our favorite song,

17:43.520 --> 17:45.272
I would walk 500 miles...

17:47.274 --> 17:50.360
Stampede!

18:19.306 --> 18:22.643
- Isn't he adorable?
- He loves those dogs.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.813
I'm hearing a lot of good things
about that guy.

18:28.065 --> 18:28.982
That's it.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.526
Glenn, are you okay?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.069
No, I'm not okay.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.987
I thought I could do this, but I can't.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.697
I've been lying to you,

18:35.781 --> 18:37.658
and I've been lying to myself.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.076
There's something you need to know.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.036
I hate dogs.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.999
Uh, this party has begun
its initial descent.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.292
That's not even my dog.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.295
That's Brian, my neighbor's dog.
He can talk.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.547
Brian, say something.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.215
- Brack.
- Bite me.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.676
Glenn...
I can't believe this.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.970
So you don't like dogs, that's fine.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.140
But you didn't have to lie
and put me through all of this.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.393
Goodbye, Glenn.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.858
Uh, folks, please use caution
as you exit the party,

19:10.941 --> 19:13.443
as some of your feelings may have shifted.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.362
Well, well, well.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.323
Save it, Brian.
I'll concede that you were right.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.992
But you know what?
So was I.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.368
Dogs are the worst.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.912
And I'm coming for you, Brian the dog.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

19:26.081 --> 19:27.708
But one day.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.084
Maybe tomorrow.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.794
And when that day comes, you're gonna say,

19:30.878 --> 19:33.505
"Ooh, Glenn got me good."

19:33.589 --> 19:36.175
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to take a walk.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.968
Brack?

19:39.469 --> 19:43.182
Oh, no.
Stay...

19:46.101 --> 19:48.228
You're coming back, though, right?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.613
Hey, Brian, I was just
over talking to Quagmire,

19:57.696 --> 19:59.114
and he thought you might
want to take a look

19:59.198 --> 20:00.365
at my new screenplay.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.491
Oh, I-I don't really, uh...

20:01.575 --> 20:02.993
It's called <i>Ocean's 1.</i>

20:03.076 --> 20:04.578
Between you and me, I can't believe

20:04.661 --> 20:05.996
nobody's done it before,

20:06.079 --> 20:08.248
to say nothing of <i>Ocean's 2</i> through <i>7.</i>

20:08.332 --> 20:10.584
Yeah, I-I could, uh, take a look, sure.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.044
It's a little long right now.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.962
It's about 430 pages.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.133
I have my "all is lost" moment
on page 389, thereabouts.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.929
Quagmire!

20:22.012 --> 20:25.599
Now, if'n you don't know,
most Hollywood screenplays

20:25.682 --> 20:28.477
wrap up at around 110 pages.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.272
And if'n it's a comedy, why,
you want it in the 90s.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.734
Anyway, they said I could
have these last few seconds

20:35.817 --> 20:38.654
to mention something near and dear to me.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.324
So, men, don't be afraid
to have the doctor

20:42.407 --> 20:45.244
put a camera up your old saddle masher.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.913
They knock you out now,
and it's a good way

20:47.996 --> 20:51.375
to make sure there's
no bad beans in your mess wagon.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.544
We hope you've enjoyed the <i>Family Guy.</i>
