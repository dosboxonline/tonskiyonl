02:02.164 --> 02:04.758
Don't push me.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.428
Stick with him. Don't let
him get too far ahead.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.215
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Not yet, honey.

02:13.216 --> 02:17.845
There isn't any people on the
side streets. And they're darker.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.680
That's just what
they'd want, honey.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.432
Daddy, I'm scared.

02:21.433 --> 02:26.145
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.898
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

02:28.899 --> 02:31.734
Oh, he's seen us. Whatever
you do, no eye contact.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.863
- He can make you do what he wants.
- Got it.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.575
See him? He just got lost
in that crowd there.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.995
That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.090
Maybe I can cut him
off at the corner.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.762
Let's get him.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.306
Daddy, they're coming.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.817
Taxi. Taxi.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.614
Drive.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.944
- Stop!
- Hey, stop the car! Hey, cabbie.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.119
Don't pay any attention
to them. Just drive.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.453
Come on, let's get back to the
car. We can chase them down.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.297
Let's move it.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.874
Hey, mister, where are we going?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.334
The airport.

03:30.335 --> 03:35.297
Wait, wait, I can't go to
the airport. It's too far.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.799
Look...

03:41.346 --> 03:43.639
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.642
I want you to take my daughter
and I to the airport.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.978
Sure, sure. Okay, mister.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.901
Drive.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.155
I ain't turning down no $500.

04:11.334 --> 04:17.214
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

04:17.214 --> 04:21.177
Five of these injections
will be water.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.679
Five of them will be
water mixed with

04:23.680 --> 04:26.098
a tiny amount of a
chemical compound

04:26.099 --> 04:31.150
which we call "Lot Six."

04:32.189 --> 04:34.899
The exact nature of this
compound is classified

04:34.900 --> 04:39.701
but it is essentially a
hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

04:41.031 --> 04:45.201
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

04:45.202 --> 04:49.246
which is to say that
neither you nor we

04:49.247 --> 04:53.751
know who has received the
clear dose and who has not.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.212
Until later, that is.

04:56.213 --> 05:01.884
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.221
Are there any questions?

05:05.222 --> 05:10.228
Uh, Dr. Wanless, is this
experiment being done by The Shop?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.941
No.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.571
Absolutely not.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.066
Yes?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.567
When do I get my money?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.069
Right on, man.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.570
That is important.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.491
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.124
I'm broke too.

05:29.621 --> 05:33.250
So, if we may begin the
injections now, please.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.970
Andy McGee.

05:39.506 --> 05:44.760
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little
nervous about this, Andy McGee.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.304
What if I go on a bad trip?

05:47.305 --> 05:50.274
We'll probably just
get distilled water.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.116
Feel any pain?

06:07.117 --> 06:11.622
I feel a pressure.
It's a bad pressure.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.125
It will pass.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.795
How are you feeling?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.172
When do we start to shrink?

06:22.173 --> 06:25.176
You believe you're going to shrink?

06:26.553 --> 06:33.277
Sh-ri-nk...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.526
You'll be fine.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.743
We'll be fine.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.541
I can't feel my hands.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.672
Thank you. What a nice compliment.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.589
I didn't say anything.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.842
You did.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.178
What'd I say?

07:09.179 --> 07:11.388
You said my hair is beautiful.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.724
Like copper set on fire.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.353
Yeah.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.862
But I didn't say that.
I just thought it.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.531
<i>I love you. I've always loved you.</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:31.367
<i>I've known you for
a thousand years.</i>

07:31.368 --> 07:33.202
<i>That long?</i>

07:33.203 --> 07:36.582
<i>Yes, I've loved you too.</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:12.658
Hey, buddy, airport. You okay?

08:14.411 --> 08:18.580
I got a headache.
Wake up, baby doll.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.917
We're here. Come on.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.962
Where are we?

08:24.963 --> 08:28.137
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.426
Try the airport.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.349
Roger.

08:43.773 --> 08:47.776
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

08:47.777 --> 08:52.656
What do you call this thing he's
got? How he pushes people.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.701
The Shop figures he may
be running down by now.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.871
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.123
It's doing something to his brain.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.208
Like what?

09:03.209 --> 09:07.880
Giving himself pinprick
hemorrhages, maybe?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.673
It could kill him.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.847
Good, let's hope.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.812
We don't have any more money and
we don't have anything left to sell.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.023
We can't stay here.

09:26.024 --> 09:30.069
It's not right. It's
not right to steal.

09:30.070 --> 09:35.491
Honey, I know, but it's not right for
them to keep coming after us, either.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.203
Now, I explained that to you,
Charlie, at least I tried.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.247
About the big bad
and the little bad?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.250
That's right. Lesser
and greater evil.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.212
Big bad is what I did to Mommy?

09:48.213 --> 09:51.173
Oh, darling, please.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.176
Don't. Don't, baby.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.346
I made Mommy scream.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.941
Shh...

10:09.359 --> 10:12.203
Does your head still hurt?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.581
Poor Daddy.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.291
Gotta keep a lookout.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.214
Okay.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.385
I don't know what you're doing here.
We've been through this 100 times.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.428
I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.389
I told you not to follow me here.

10:40.390 --> 10:45.769
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.604
This ain't got nothing
to do with me.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.065
- I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.
- That's not true.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.867
I'm not ready to get married, so
why don't you just get outta here?

10:55.113 --> 10:57.114
Why don't you just stop bugging me?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.824
Come on, Charlie.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.034
You told me you loved me.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.459
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.481
This ain't got nothing
to do with me.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.692
We've been through this 100 times.
I don't want you around.

11:33.693 --> 11:39.290
I'm not responsible. Look,
I told you not to follow me here.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.580
But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.705
I don't have any money.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.540
I'm not the only guy
you've been with.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.710
That's not true.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.505
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.010
That's not what my
buddy Al told me...

12:11.147 --> 12:13.991
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.746
All right, buddy, come outta there.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.748
Mind waiting till I
put my feet out?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.751
I was coming with you and I saw him

12:32.752 --> 12:35.712
and before I could stop
it, it just happened.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.924
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's okay, honey.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.842
- But I set him on fire!
- Charlie.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.721
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

12:44.722 --> 12:49.851
I want you to listen to me. You said
it got away from you and it did.

12:49.852 --> 12:55.107
But not like before. It
just got away a little bit.

12:55.108 --> 13:00.404
Charlie, you might've set that
man's face on fire or his hair.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.865
Now, it always goes out at
somebody you don't like.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.243
But you didn't really
hurt that guy.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.620
Not like I hurt Mommy
in the kitchen.

13:08.621 --> 13:14.048
Baby. Baby, you've got to
stop thinking about that.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.629
It wasn't you that really hurt
Mommy. It wasn't you that...

13:17.630 --> 13:20.633
That killed her.

13:30.101 --> 13:33.320
That's right. That's right.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.315
Now...

13:36.316 --> 13:38.944
We've got to go on.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.572
Single file. Just like the Indians.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.919
And keep as far over to the side
of the road as you can, okay?

14:02.759 --> 14:07.059
I seen them both. This guy looked
kind of sick, or something.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.685
Are you okay?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.104
So far, so good, baby.
You getting tired?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.523
Nope.

14:18.524 --> 14:23.495
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.875
Okay. Come on.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.127
Okay, sweetheart, come on.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.638
Head up Route 70.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.973
Oh, Daddy!

14:50.348 --> 14:52.224
Daddy, get up.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.695
Daddy, wake up.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.157
Daddy? Daddy?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.706
Are you all right?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.380
I thought you were dead.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.090
Are you kidding?

15:25.091 --> 15:30.597
Think I'd do that to you? You're
all I've got in this world.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.027
But I'm happy about that
'cause I'm crazy about you.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.063
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.533
Come on. We gotta find
a place to sleep.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.745
We can afford it now.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.516
I burned him.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.060
Rest, sweetheart.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.606
You didn't hurt him.
You controlled it.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.201
Shh...

16:31.115 --> 16:35.744
Okay, Charlie. Now,
let it out. Easy does it.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.914
Let it go.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.667
Attagirl.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.336
Attagirl. Okay.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.839
Now pull it back.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.845
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.440
Good Lord.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.271
Now, you've got to
learn to control that.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.776
You gotta try real hard. Okay?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.819
I couldn't help it.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.863
Tomorrow. She's tired.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.326
Time for bed. You can
try again at breakfast.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.037
I want to do that again.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.539
No, tomorrow.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.791
I'm not tired.
I want to do it again.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
I said no.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.300
Again. Now!

17:33.636 --> 17:36.805
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.307
Well, you did it. You
hurt your mother.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.726
I'm sorry, Mommy.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.145
It's all right. Mommy's all right.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.898
Charlie, you have got
to control this thing

17:46.899 --> 17:50.068
because it's a bad thing, you
understand me? A bad thing.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.279
Leave her alone.
It's not her fault.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.657
Hello?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.375
Sorry.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.581
Hung up again?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.207
Whoever it is.

18:04.208 --> 18:09.680
We know who they are and they want to
make sure we're staying right here.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.101
<i>Vicky? Charlie?</i>

18:19.390 --> 18:21.433
I'm home.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.028
Sweetheart?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.707
Vicky!

19:02.516 --> 19:05.060
Oh...

19:05.061 --> 19:07.279
Oh, no.

19:09.899 --> 19:13.568
Oh, no. Please, please, God.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.820
Please don't be here.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.244
Please don't...

19:18.741 --> 19:22.586
Oh, no! Please, no, no!

19:22.787 --> 19:27.165
No! Oh, babe! What did they do?

19:27.166 --> 19:31.762
What did they do? They
put this in your mouth.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.023
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

19:43.974 --> 19:46.602
Charlie!

19:48.646 --> 19:53.777
Charlie!

19:56.821 --> 19:59.449
Charlie!

20:04.120 --> 20:07.043
Charlie!

20:08.040 --> 20:11.635
Joan, by any chance is
my daughter with you?

20:17.341 --> 20:20.139
<i>Hold her!</i>

20:33.190 --> 20:36.318
Okay, that's far enough.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.871
Drop the gun.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.505
Drop it.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.095
Bring her to me.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.019
You're blind.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.532
Ahh! My eyes!

21:17.735 --> 21:22.989
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.036
My eyes! My eyes!

21:28.037 --> 21:31.711
Oh, my God! Leon!

21:32.583 --> 21:34.167
Andy!

21:34.168 --> 21:35.627
My eyes!

21:35.628 --> 21:38.254
Joan.

21:39.965 --> 21:44.436
Go back inside the house. You
won't remember any of this.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.564
Leon! Oh, God!

21:48.891 --> 21:51.476
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

21:51.477 --> 21:53.775
Can't see!

22:08.577 --> 22:11.287
Wake up, baby.
It's time to move on.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.416
Morning.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.814
Duane. Morning, Josie.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.440
Good morning.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.819
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.863
Put him right through when he does.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.324
And Rainbird is in your office.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.827
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.465
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.070
Welcome back, Rainbird.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.655
How was Venice?

23:27.656 --> 23:30.579
Sinking.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.495
Is our problem there solved?

23:34.496 --> 23:38.170
Our problem there is solved.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.209
Dr. Wanless is here.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.712
Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.179
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

23:52.973 --> 23:55.016
Have you caught them yet?

23:55.017 --> 23:57.518
We'll catch them. What do you want?

23:57.519 --> 24:02.357
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

24:02.358 --> 24:05.443
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.743
expunge them, wipe them
from the face of the earth.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.982
Andrew McGee and his daughter
constitute the greatest...

24:15.008 --> 24:18.665
- ...threat that's confronted this nation.
- That's a lot of crap.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.588
You feel guilt!

24:20.626 --> 24:24.754
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

24:24.755 --> 24:28.424
You want to justify
your participation.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.927
You were all in favor
of it at the time.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.602
I know.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.611
I didn't realize.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.824
None of us did.

24:45.109 --> 24:51.823
Lot Six was nothing more than a
synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.866
A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.

24:53.867 --> 24:57.997
For God's sake, Joe, don't
start again. Come on.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.516
You see...

25:10.759 --> 25:13.353
You see...

25:14.805 --> 25:19.809
This pituitary extract is responsible for
the occasional flashes of psi ability

25:19.810 --> 25:23.189
which most human beings
demonstrate from time to time.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.608
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

25:27.609 --> 25:29.819
the kind of domination that this

25:29.820 --> 25:32.155
experiment brought
out in Andrew McGee.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.449
What is the point, Doctor?

25:34.450 --> 25:36.451
Ever since this child was born,

25:36.452 --> 25:39.328
her father has been trying to
inhibit her use of those powers.

25:39.329 --> 25:45.927
But what if his control
had weakened now?

25:46.837 --> 25:50.715
Why would he lose control
now after all these years?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.009
Ask yourself this question.

25:53.010 --> 25:58.681
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

25:58.682 --> 26:01.184
when this child was an infant?

26:01.185 --> 26:04.312
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

26:04.313 --> 26:08.816
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

26:08.817 --> 26:11.661
bursts into smoky flame.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.198
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

26:15.199 --> 26:17.366
but you're making her
sound like Armageddon.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.993
Yes.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.996
And that's what it might well be.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.922
Suppose lighting fires is
merely the tip of the iceberg.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.882
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.173
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

26:32.174 --> 26:36.260
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

26:36.261 --> 26:41.349
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

26:41.350 --> 26:45.229
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

26:46.438 --> 26:51.761
Suppose we have a child
here who some day...

26:51.787 --> 26:57.407
is capable of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

26:58.242 --> 27:02.337
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?

27:02.746 --> 27:06.207
Then allow me to progress from
insanity to utter lunacy.

27:06.208 --> 27:10.920
Suppose there is a little girl out
there somewhere today, this morning,

27:10.921 --> 27:17.218
who has within her, lying
dormant at present,

27:17.219 --> 27:21.097
the power some day to crack
the very planet in two,

27:21.098 --> 27:24.693
like a china plate in
a shooting gallery.

27:33.152 --> 27:37.238
What if we could train this
little girl? And others as well.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.407
Could we ever have
more powerful weapons?

27:39.408 --> 27:41.951
No! No more experiments.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.744
Don't force me to
go above your head

27:43.745 --> 27:45.454
because I swear to
you I will if I have to.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.378
I'll have you and this entire
establishment eliminated.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.928
An excitable man.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.442
Where are we gonna go now?

28:14.443 --> 28:17.412
Well, we're gonna have to find
some place to stay for a while.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.238
I don't know if
anybody'll believe us,

28:19.239 --> 28:21.699
but if we send letters to
the important newspapers

28:21.700 --> 28:24.123
maybe The Shop will
have to lay off.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.215
We could go to Granther's.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.709
What made you think of that?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.628
I don't know.

28:33.629 --> 28:38.259
'Cause I was thinking about your
grandfather not five minutes ago.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.810
We'll check the motel. I want you
to work the road further down.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.312
Got it.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.321
Well... That's a
pretty little miss.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.656
What's your name, missy?

29:01.657 --> 29:03.366
Roberta.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.826
Well, Bobby, where are you
headed for this morning?

29:05.827 --> 29:08.329
Well, we're headed for
Tennessee. Knoxville.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.373
My wife's there
visiting her sister.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.499
Ran into a little problem.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.583
Did she now?

29:12.584 --> 29:17.338
Yeah, labor. This one's got a new
baby brother, 1:40 this morning.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.757
His name's Andy. Isn't
that a nice name?

29:19.758 --> 29:22.176
I think it's a corker.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.470
Mine's Irv Manders. Come on in now.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.349
I'll get you 10 miles closer
to Knoxville, anyway.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.709
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

29:54.710 --> 29:55.876
No, damn it, it's them.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.378
- Did you get the number?
- Yeah, I got it.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.504
Did you see which way they went?

29:58.505 --> 30:01.226
- Well, I didn't even see them check out.
- Try to remember the time.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.227
Hey, we got them.

30:15.856 --> 30:19.483
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

30:19.484 --> 30:22.908
- Oh, we couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.740
Are you sure you got enough?

30:25.741 --> 30:27.993
Always, and I'm glad to have you.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.494
Thank you very much.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.621
My pleasure, Bobby.

30:32.622 --> 30:36.125
It'll be my wife's too when
she gets a look at you.

30:36.126 --> 30:39.420
Always wanted a
little girl herself.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.595
But I guess that wasn't to be.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.513
Got a song for you.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.849
<i>Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg</i>

30:51.850 --> 30:54.185
<i>Finest old hen that
ever laid an egg</i>

30:54.186 --> 30:56.771
<i>She laid her eggs all over the farm</i>

30:56.772 --> 30:59.315
<i>Another little drink
won't do us any harm</i>

31:17.459 --> 31:19.126
Who'd you bring home, Irv?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.795
This little girl is Roberta.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.130
This young fella here's her daddy.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.384
I didn't catch his name yet so
I don't know if we're related.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.302
Frank Burton, ma'am.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.521
Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.640
Hi.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.643
Hello.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.982
Your husband was nice enough to invite
us back for lunch. Hope you don't mind.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.827
Why, sure. Come on in.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.033
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.858
More room out than
there is in, button.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.861
If I eat any more,
I think I'll split.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.909
That's what my mom used to...

32:29.698 --> 32:34.544
I mean, that's what
she always says.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.875
Norma, why don't you and Bobby
go out and feed those chickens?

32:40.876 --> 32:43.344
I want to have a little
talk with Frank here.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.755
Would you like that?

32:46.756 --> 32:48.215
Do they peck?

32:48.216 --> 32:51.051
Only what they eat, honey.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.428
Come on.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.226
Okay. Goody.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.403
Want a beer, Frank?

33:01.938 --> 33:05.316
It isn't Frank, but I
guess you know that.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.652
I guess I did.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.076
- What is your name?
- Andy.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.074
Well, Andy, what about that beer?

33:14.075 --> 33:16.285
I guess I could use it.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.914
You got it.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.586
There you go.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.421
Thank you.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.039
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right.

33:30.065 --> 33:31.872
I know this routine.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.352
Cops after you, Andy?

33:41.353 --> 33:43.981
Sort of cops, yeah.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.816
You snatch that little
girl from her mother?

33:47.817 --> 33:53.197
No, she's my daughter, but her
mother didn't set the cops on us.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.826
Her mother's been dead for a year.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.587
Don't appear like you got
her against her will.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.042
What do they want you
for, anyway, Andy?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.502
Who are they?

34:06.503 --> 34:07.962
Government agents.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.964
FBI?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.840
No, The Shop.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.809
The Shop?

34:14.302 --> 34:20.103
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

34:21.059 --> 34:25.478
My daughter, Charlene
and I, Charlie,

34:25.480 --> 34:31.025
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.996
Tell me about it.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.032
Okay, now go ahead.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.202
Thank you. Do you
eat these chickens?

34:40.203 --> 34:44.549
If I can catch one, I might
eat one. We eat the eggs.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.876
They want to examine
her and study her.

34:47.877 --> 34:51.347
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

34:51.505 --> 34:55.260
I think they want to use her to
reactivate the Lot Six program.

34:56.386 --> 35:00.389
Andy, I think you ought to call
the police. Turn yourself in.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.766
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.520
As crazy as anything
I've ever heard.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.861
Daddy, I fed the...

35:10.191 --> 35:12.735
You told.

35:12.736 --> 35:15.989
Daddy, why'd you tell?

35:19.993 --> 35:23.246
<i>They're coming.
They're coming for us.</i>

35:27.876 --> 35:32.973
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

35:33.923 --> 35:37.760
Yes, yes, that's what they want
to do. They want to kill you.

35:37.761 --> 35:41.305
Kill you like they did Mommy and
take me away. I won't let it happen.

35:41.306 --> 35:45.731
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

35:48.063 --> 35:51.407
Charlie, now, watch
what you're doing.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.610
Is it too late?

35:54.611 --> 35:58.581
Yes, they're coming
up the dirt road now.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.251
Daddy, I'm scared.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.999
Charlie, you can stop them.

36:06.831 --> 36:11.757
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

36:12.796 --> 36:15.130
Oh, Charlie...

36:15.131 --> 36:16.965
Of course I'll still love you.

36:16.966 --> 36:21.471
I love you more than anything in
the world, no matter what happens.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.853
I got some tall apologizing to do.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.189
There's a line of cars
coming up the road.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.317
I'll stand with you if you
want. I'll get my deer gun.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.991
You don't need your gun.

37:10.812 --> 37:14.657
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.151
Honey, you don't
have to run anymore.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.529
Go away.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.490
Afraid I can't do that,
honey. I have my orders.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.576
No one wants to hurt
you or your daddy.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.752
You liar, you're supposed
to kill him and I know it.

37:29.998 --> 37:33.667
I'd advise you do what
my daughter says.

37:33.668 --> 37:37.513
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

37:40.675 --> 37:44.178
You men are trespassing. I want
you to get the hell off my property.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.346
We're government agents, sir.

37:46.347 --> 37:50.017
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.228
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassinating the president.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.522
Show me a warrant or get
the hell off my land.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.774
We don't need a warrant.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.118
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

37:59.444 --> 38:03.238
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

38:03.239 --> 38:06.533
Honest to gosh, there's nothing
going on here, except...

38:06.534 --> 38:09.328
We know what's going on.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.039
Please, don't make me do anything.

38:24.803 --> 38:30.390
Get out! Don't you understand what
she's doing? Can't you feel it?

38:30.391 --> 38:33.060
Don't be stupid.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.062
If we can only discuss
this, please.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.396
Get him!

38:36.397 --> 38:38.069
Watch it, Andy. Watch it.

38:38.942 --> 38:42.491
Not the girl. Not the girl.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.165
Help! Help!

38:55.166 --> 38:56.963
Help me!

38:57.752 --> 38:59.595
No, don't.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.718
No, don't.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.051
No! Don't!

39:21.317 --> 39:22.985
Now, get out of here.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.706
She's never done anything like this
before. I don't know if she can stop.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.866
Get out. Get out.

39:31.953 --> 39:34.296
Go! Go!

39:36.124 --> 39:38.718
Help me!

39:51.472 --> 39:54.066
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!

39:56.811 --> 39:57.978
Charlie.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.704
Stop it. That's enough.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.415
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

40:18.416 --> 40:21.010
Sorry, Daddy.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.263
Let's get outta here,
back to The Shop.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.187
Go, go, go!

40:44.609 --> 40:47.203
Oh, my God.

40:50.281 --> 40:54.368
Andy. There's an old Willys
Jeep out behind the barn.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.621
No, Irv, don't get
involved any deeper.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.040
Those men came here without
any warrants at all,

41:00.041 --> 41:04.252
tried to take them off our
land, one of them shot me.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.631
What do you want me to do? Sit here and
turn them over to the secret police?

41:07.632 --> 41:12.094
They'll be getting their peckers up
enough to come back. Be a good Nazi?

41:12.095 --> 41:14.638
I guess not.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.099
You don't have to do anything else.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.602
No, please, take the
Jeep and get away.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.231
Just get away.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.854
Charlie.

42:03.855 --> 42:07.985
There's the lake. We're here.

43:01.079 --> 43:06.333
Come on, Charlie. We got
a lot of cleaning up to do.

43:06.334 --> 43:10.253
Nobody's lived here since
your grandfather died.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.678
I hope that key's still here.

43:29.524 --> 43:33.068
Do you think they'll find us here?

43:33.069 --> 43:35.487
After what you did at the farm,

43:35.488 --> 43:38.207
I think they're gonna
stay pretty far away.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.867
If they still want to capture us,

43:40.868 --> 43:45.413
they're gonna have to figure
out a different way to do it.

43:45.414 --> 43:49.259
Well, anyways, we've
got us a new home.

43:50.795 --> 43:53.389
Let's go. Let's go.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.800
Don't it look good?

43:56.801 --> 44:00.554
Daddy, will things ever
be the same for us again?

44:00.555 --> 44:03.558
Will I be able to go to
school, and things, again?

44:04.559 --> 44:06.561
Sure you can.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.188
After you write the letters, right?

44:10.189 --> 44:12.232
That's right.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.451
Tell the newspapers all about it.

44:15.236 --> 44:18.405
Then the running'll be over.

44:18.406 --> 44:21.705
We'll live normal lives,
like everybody else.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.915
Can I be?

44:28.916 --> 44:30.667
What?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.961
Like everybody else?

44:32.962 --> 44:35.635
Darn tootin' you can.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.306
I want to be.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.727
Look who's here.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.357
How do you feel?

44:54.358 --> 44:56.326
Safe.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.748
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.349
Do you have a phone here?

46:09.350 --> 46:11.898
Right over here.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.695
<i>They're here. They
mailed some letters.</i>

46:21.696 --> 46:23.446
All right, good deal.

46:23.447 --> 46:27.575
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.703
- Mr. McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.872
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.626
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

46:35.668 --> 46:37.669
You know what that
little girl can do.

46:37.670 --> 46:41.089
I know what the little girl can do.
That's why I'll bring her here.

46:41.090 --> 46:44.987
So you can do all your
tests. On the condition...

46:45.013 --> 46:48.990
that you give her to me for disposal
when you're finished with her.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.982
What?

46:51.225 --> 46:53.835
I want her when you've
finished with her.

46:53.836 --> 46:55.729
You are mad.

46:55.730 --> 47:00.400
How right you are. So are
you, mad as a hatter.

47:00.401 --> 47:05.071
You sit here making plans for controlling
a force that's beyond your comprehension.

47:05.072 --> 47:07.574
A force that belongs only
to the gods themselves.

47:07.575 --> 47:09.497
What the hell are
you talking about?

47:10.119 --> 47:12.667
Things I'm sure you wouldn't
want the world to know.

47:15.916 --> 47:20.253
What's to stop me from having
you erased right here and now?

47:20.254 --> 47:21.421
Hmm.

47:21.422 --> 47:27.594
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

47:27.595 --> 47:30.638
The Shop will cease to
exist within six weeks.

47:30.639 --> 47:33.933
And within six months, you will
stand in front of a judge,

47:33.934 --> 47:39.272
awaiting sentence for crimes serious
enough to keep you behind bars

47:39.273 --> 47:41.320
for the rest of your life.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.537
Just, um...

47:54.538 --> 47:56.998
What is it you want?

47:56.999 --> 48:00.877
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

48:00.878 --> 48:02.879
will not end when I bring her here.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.882
That's just the beginning. We're
going to be friends, Captain.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.300
We haven't got her yet.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.144
We'll have her.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.141
All right.

48:15.142 --> 48:19.646
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

48:19.647 --> 48:22.149
She's very beautiful.
She's very young.

48:22.233 --> 48:26.237
Yet inside her is the
power of the gods.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.864
We're going to be close, she and I.

48:29.865 --> 48:33.619
Oh, yes. Gonna be very close.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.331
Reel in some of the
slack out of the line.

48:38.332 --> 48:42.377
Real slow, come on in, a little
more. Reel in. Reel it.

48:42.378 --> 48:46.089
Okay, now give it a little
tug. Attagirl, now reel.

48:46.090 --> 48:49.342
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

48:49.343 --> 48:50.844
A real whopper.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.387
Lookee here. How about that?

49:12.700 --> 49:15.248
Here he comes.

49:20.541 --> 49:22.208
Saved by the Postal Department.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.294
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Am I glad to see you.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.545
I think we got a dead battery.

49:25.546 --> 49:27.464
I was hoping maybe you could
give us a jump or something?

49:27.465 --> 49:29.340
Let's take a look at it. It
might not be the battery.

49:29.341 --> 49:32.190
Thanks a lot, I really
appreciate it.

50:35.491 --> 50:37.450
Where will we go now?

50:37.451 --> 50:39.827
Offices of The New York Times.

50:39.828 --> 50:42.121
But you sent them a letter.

50:42.122 --> 50:45.458
Well, they might not have
gotten it, sweetheart.

50:45.459 --> 50:47.961
Do you think they took them?

50:47.962 --> 50:50.556
No!

51:09.316 --> 51:12.490
- I'll get it, baby.
- I can do it!

51:14.488 --> 51:18.658
Baby, baby, come on,
now. It's almost over.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.827
It's never gonna be over!

51:20.828 --> 51:23.830
- It's not over.
- Come on.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.873
No, it's not.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.875
Yes, it is. Come here.

51:34.341 --> 51:35.675
Are you ready to go?

51:35.676 --> 51:37.010
I guess so.

51:37.011 --> 51:41.014
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

51:41.015 --> 51:44.225
Even if they come
before we can get away.

51:44.226 --> 51:48.271
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

51:48.272 --> 51:52.402
That's okay, Charlie.
I can understand that.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.695
Okay.

51:55.696 --> 51:57.071
Jump.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.700
That's a big girl.

52:18.093 --> 52:20.721
Okay...

52:52.378 --> 52:55.427
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

53:00.636 --> 53:03.680
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

53:03.681 --> 53:06.432
Who shot my daughter?

53:06.433 --> 53:11.109
Come on out where I can
see you, you son of a bitch.

53:12.773 --> 53:14.274
Baby.

54:14.835 --> 54:17.212
Nothing to it.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.894
Charlie!

55:14.895 --> 55:19.241
She's all right, Mr. McGee.
Take it easy.

55:25.489 --> 55:28.908
Where is she? I want to see her.

55:28.909 --> 55:32.787
All in good time.
First, let's talk.

55:32.788 --> 55:35.837
Let's get acquainted.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.086
Go to hell.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.965
I tell you, she's
gonna be all right.

55:49.847 --> 55:52.014
No. No.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.366
What do you want with us?

56:10.367 --> 56:12.201
I told you, Mr. McGee.

56:12.202 --> 56:15.955
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other,

56:15.956 --> 56:19.000
and I want to introduce myself.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.544
I'm Dr. Pynchot.

56:21.545 --> 56:26.016
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.978
Is this The Shop?

56:35.017 --> 56:38.020
This is The Shop.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.398
Hi, Charlene.

57:24.399 --> 57:26.317
I'm Captain Hollister.
May I come in?

57:26.318 --> 57:28.536
Where's my daddy?

57:31.823 --> 57:34.496
I brought you some cocoa.

57:42.918 --> 57:44.669
I don't want anything.

57:44.670 --> 57:48.515
There's nothing to be
afraid of. Here.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.927
You see? Go on.

57:54.513 --> 57:57.516
Well, maybe later.

57:59.726 --> 58:04.197
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.399
I know you may not believe this,

58:06.400 --> 58:10.746
but I've actually begun to think
of you as my own daughter.

58:11.154 --> 58:13.572
What have you done to my father?

58:13.573 --> 58:15.950
He's resting and he's
fine, just like you.

58:15.951 --> 58:18.577
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

58:18.578 --> 58:20.705
and he wants you to
cooperate with us.

58:20.706 --> 58:22.423
You're a liar.

58:22.874 --> 58:25.918
Now, what kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

58:25.919 --> 58:27.545
Go to hell!

58:27.546 --> 58:29.514
Oh?

58:30.090 --> 58:32.258
A very stubborn nice little girl.

58:32.259 --> 58:34.427
That's all right, I understand.

58:34.428 --> 58:37.388
I know you're tired and you're not quite
sure where you are or why you're here.

58:37.389 --> 58:39.098
So I just want to ease
your mind, Charlie.

58:39.099 --> 58:41.272
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

58:44.604 --> 58:46.981
All right, Charlene.

58:46.982 --> 58:51.277
You are here because I'm very
interested in this ability that you have.

58:51.278 --> 58:53.320
Pyrokinesis.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.613
Yes.

58:54.614 --> 58:59.285
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

58:59.286 --> 59:01.288
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

59:01.455 --> 59:03.789
you'll be doing this great country
of ours a really big favor

59:03.790 --> 59:05.791
if you just cooperate with us.

59:05.792 --> 59:11.423
I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I want to see my father.

59:14.092 --> 59:16.302
Okay.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.511
Um...

59:17.512 --> 59:20.310
Why don't you drink the
cocoa and get some sleep?

59:20.474 --> 59:24.979
If there's anything you want, just
pick up the phone and let us know.

59:26.229 --> 59:29.982
I know you'll find this hard
to believe now, Charlie,

59:29.983 --> 59:32.656
but you and me are gonna be pals.

59:32.861 --> 59:34.453
Never.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.199
Never say never.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.828
I'll see you, Charlie.

59:43.955 --> 59:46.549
Good night, Charlie.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.519
Just back off. Back off.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.978
No!

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:10.527
You're not gonna do it.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.319
Back off!

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:20.658
Come on, take these pills.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.047
Come on, swallow.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:35.756
- Lovely hair, so red, so beautiful.
- Look what I have here.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.384
A wind-up cat doll.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:42.221
Listen to that, sweetheart.
Isn't that pretty?

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:43.347
Huh?

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.942
Sure you want this...

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.950
Hi, kid.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.096
You go ahead with your game.
I'll start in the bedroom.

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:10.310
My name's John.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:15.441
They call you Charlie, don't they?

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:21.487
Hey...

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.988
You want to teach me
how to play that?

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.662
'Cause I'm terrible at games.
You can beat me all the time.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.459
No.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.334
Where's Charlie? What
are you doing with her?

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:37.253
I told you, Andy, she's
perfectly all right.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.837
There's nothing to worry about.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.673
Yeah, well, I want to
see her, goddamn it.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.892
Just behave yourself.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:46.855
Do as we ask, we'll see.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.516
You bastards.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:52.610
Are you gonna do the test or not?

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:57.031
Oh, sure. Well, sure.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:00.527
Good deal.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:06.161
It's a one-way glass. You won't
see us but we'll see you.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:23.220
All right, send him in.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:28.554
Hi, how are you?

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:31.353
Having the time of
my life. Sit down.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.688
Did they tell you
anything about what

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.274
we're supposed to be doing in here?

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:44.120
All they told me was
to come talk to you.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.700
You look nervous. Thirsty?
Want some water?

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.750
Yeah, I'm thirsty.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:57.458
You know, they mentioned
something about a test.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.751
Uh-huh.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.127
You want some water?

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.756
No, I'll pass.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.576
Why don't you put some ink in it?

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.587
Put ink in it?

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.381
You gotta be crazy.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.637
- Goddamn it.
- He's tipped over.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.847
He's been on the run too long.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.933
All those damn pills you've
been giving him haven't helped.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.184
Just give me time.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.813
No, Rainbird's right. He's
lost it and time won't help.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:04.576
Increase his medication. I'll
decide what to do with him later.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:09.355
- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:14.118
With a little luck, before long,
she'll trust me like a brother.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.496
Hi, kid, how you doing?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:56.168
Why do you come every
day? I'm not messy.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:06:00.173
It's just my job, kid.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:06.879
Because they're all
full of shit. Why else?

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:12.926
I want to see my father.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.521
Sure you do.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:20.350
I wish I could help. I don't
even know where the man is.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.730
This is a big place, Charlie.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:30.527
They say they'll let me see
him if I... if I do something.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.112
And I don't want to.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.739
Well...

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.074
Can it be that bad, what
they want you to do?

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.249
I mean, if just by doing it, you
can get to see your old man.

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:42.335
It is.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:51.089
Storm's coming on. Sure hope those
lights don't go off altogether.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.888
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.438
Hey...

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.273
Listen.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.234
Are you scared by my face?

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.659
I mean, I could wear
a mask or something.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:15.573
I've seen worse.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:01.668
Kid! Kid, please!

01:08:01.953 --> 01:08:05.332
I can't stand the dark.
Please, kid.

01:08:05.898 --> 01:08:07.399
Kid!

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.085
I gotta get outta here.
You gotta help me.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.545
Use your card.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.674
All the electricity's gone. The card's
no good. Hey, let me outta here.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.178
Hey! Let me out!

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:23.724
- What's the matter?
- Let us out. Hey! There's people in here.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:26.853
Stop it, we're okay.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.734
I mean, aren't we?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.899
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:39.497
It's just... The dark.
I can't stand it.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:44.243
It's just like the place they
put me when I was captured.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:46.622
Who put you?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.915
The Cong.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.709
Who's the Cong?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.586
You mean to tell me...

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:56.256
Oh, no, of course not,
you're too young.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:59.091
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:04.723
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pajamas.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:08.225
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.354
Only about six of us got out.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:13.106
We ran.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:16.234
Went the wrong way.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.612
They caught me.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:22.032
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:26.203
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.081
What did you eat?

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:32.042
They threw down rotted rice.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:34.920
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.707
Live ones. Great, big spiders. I'd
chase them around in the dark

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:40.926
- ...and kill them and eat them.
- Gross.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.553
They turned me into an animal.

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:47.265
You got it a little easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:50.234
Like a rat in a trap.

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:54.981
You think maybe they'll get the
lights back on pretty soon?

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:58.531
Doesn't matter. We're together.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:05.450
God, kid. If some day I could help
you the way you're helping me...

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:10.747
You could. You could get
a message to my father.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.208
You know, what's it
all about, Charlie?

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.627
Why do they have you
and your daddy here?

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.630
What is it they want you to do?

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:26.471
They won't make me
take any more pills.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.976
No more pills, you bastard.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:35.856
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:39.776
Listen, maybe I could
get in to see your dad.

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:42.028
You could? You really
think you could?

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:44.281
I could change with Herbie, one of
the orderlies in the other wing.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.991
I could see your dad,
tell him you're okay...

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:49.035
Well, maybe not tell him, but
pass him a note or something.

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.455
Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.665
Shit.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.134
Maybe you oughta light the
damn fires if you can.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:11:01.339
I told you, it's like letting
a wild animal out of a cage.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.844
I promised myself I'd
never do it again.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:11.683
That man at the airport, those men at the
farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:14.437
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defense.

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.023
Yes, but that's no excuse.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:21.693
Also sounded like you
saved your dad's life.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:24.988
Look, if you do what
they want you to do,

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.282
but only as much as you want to do,

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.034
it might just be the way for
you to get out of here.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:32.245
I'll help anyway I can.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:35.207
Oh, my! Light.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.756
Hold on there.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.850
I'm sorry you got stuck
with me in here, John.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.094
But I'm awful glad too.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:52.766
Yeah, well, you look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:56.061
Attagirl.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.610
There we go.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.787
That's the girl.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:18.919
Now, you just relax and
you'll be asleep in no time.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:25.554
And you'll have
sweet, sweet dreams.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:30.096
That's the girl.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.478
Good night, kid.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.526
Good night.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.358
Daddy.

01:12:56.664 --> 01:13:00.667
Now, Charlie, you know what
you're supposed to do.

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.419
I want you to go in the other room.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.719
I don't want to have to
look at you while I do this.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.141
Something might happen.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.201
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:39.332
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.959
Everything all right with her?

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.882
Yes.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.256
You all set in there?

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.758
Ready in here.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:53.845
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:57.475
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.690
Go ahead, Charlene.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:20.673
Wood chips. They should've
given me something harder.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.559
Something's happening in there.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:39.100
Temperature just jumped 10 degrees.

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.166
There it goes.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.424
Her alpha patterns look
like the goddamn Andes.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.104
She did it. By God, she did
it and we got it all on tape.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:31.493
Back off. Just back off.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.991
Back off.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.572
Look at the tub.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.830
Back off.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.964
Did you see the water in that
tub boil? And the temperature?

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.132
Jesus, did we get the audio?

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.300
- We got it.
- We did?

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:59.304
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.473
My God, is there anyone here

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.601
that has any doubt that she
didn't make that happen herself?

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:06.269
Not at all, Chief. None.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.938
Holy Christ! I knew something was
gonna happen, but I had no idea.

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.982
That tray actually flew
and she controlled it.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.942
Then she put her power in the tub.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:16.029
And we got it! We got it all on tape, and
it's good enough to stand up in court.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:18.323
Right up in the goddamn
Supreme Court.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:20.492
What are you looking
so miserable about?

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:21.826
You got her to do it by promising

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.161
she could see her father again.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.370
Well, so what?

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.456
She must never see him.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:28.834
We never intended to let her.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.503
She'll never stop asking for it.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:34.632
Suppose by some strange
accident they get together.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.716
Suppose they do.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.676
She does whatever he tells her.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:44.024
Suppose he persuades
her to destroy us all.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.186
No chance.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.030
There's always a chance.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:53.650
He's right. They can never
see each other again.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:56.236
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.529
Huh?

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.740
Your technician must've had an
appointment he forgot about.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.992
He just went out of here
in a hell of a rush.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:07.964
He also left the door open, and
your firestarter just walked out.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.668
Christ.

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:14.092
One of you men go and get her.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.391
Go on.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:24.681
Sure.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:29.062
Which of you would like to
go and get the little girl?

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:12.317
<i>Andy?</i>

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.655
Here you go, ol' buddy.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.580
Oh, good.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.005
Listen, Andy.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:41.216
We've determined
that your power has

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.593
deteriorated somewhat
since you got here.

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:47.348
In fact, we've had no
positive results at all.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:52.602
What do you expect with all these
drugs you've been giving me?

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:55.438
You expect me to do my
best when I'm stoned?

01:18:55.439 --> 01:19:00.443
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could to...

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.487
Yes, of course I
know that you have,

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.489
and believe me,
I appreciate it very much.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.866
In fact, I think you need a rest.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:09.535
Now, did you know that
The Shop has a small

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:12.330
compound on the island
of Maui, in Hawaii?

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:16.334
How would it be if I sent you
there for the immediate future?

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.503
I'll still get my medication?

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.006
Oh, sure, all you need.

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:24.384
Well, that sounds nice.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.808
All right, good deal.

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:30.974
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:36.481
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:25.069
She's so beautiful.
What's her name?

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:29.575
Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.285
What does "necromancer" mean?

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.954
I think it means something
like wizard or sorcerer.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.628
Something like that.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:44.756
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.175
How did I know they were gonna
be so damn stubborn about it?

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.761
I guess you'll have to
do it for them again.

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.846
But when will I ever stop?

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.890
Look, baby.

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:57.270
It's like poker.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.938
If you ain't dealing from
strength, you just ain't dealing.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.649
Every time you light
one of their fires,

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.319
make sure that you get
something in return.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.947
This is your old Uncle John
talking, you understand me?

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.449
Okay.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.701
What about this... What do you
call it? This power of yours?

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.453
I know you were awful
scared about it before.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.955
How do you feel about it now?

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:22.085
It's different now.
It's a lot stronger.

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:27.090
Yesterday, when I told
it to back off, it did.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:30.802
It was like I let it out in a
single straight line and then...

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.304
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:35.306
I put it into the water.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:40.187
If I pulled it back into
myself, I guess I'd burn up.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.523
When am I gonna get
to see my father?

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:47.151
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:50.446
Next time, there has
to be more water.

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:08.381
Everything all set here?

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:12.051
Tape running? All right, stand by.

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:15.681
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:17.700
The temperature in the testing room
should be -15 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.744
Plus or minus five degrees.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.122
It's 105 in there.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.759
The blocks are starting to burn.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.103
Cinder blocks.

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:29.276
God.

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:36.788
Back off. Just back off.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:43.995
Back off. Just back off.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.749
Back off.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.783
I want to see my father.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.418
You better tell her something.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:29.165
Soon, Charlie.

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.876
When you show us a little more.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:36.714
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:39.968
Do you hear me? I'll
make something happen.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.064
<i>Time for lunch.</i>

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:55.283
<i>Well, instant banquet.</i>

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:59.822
<i>Nice, table companion.</i>

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.924
I'm telling you, we're not
through with testing her.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:23.636
You saw what she's capable of. She
hasn't even reached her potential.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:26.013
Perhaps Herman would
like to see her

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.307
blow up a country
before he gives in.

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:31.477
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form a complete opinion

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:34.980
based on two experiments.

01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:39.281
I'm satisfied, yes,
but only partially.

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:43.410
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.909
It's all taken care of.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.298
Night, Doc.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.263
Rainbird.

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.377
Have you considered
what might happen

01:27:09.403 --> 01:27:12.268
if that girl found out whose
side you're really on?

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.812
Oh, yes, I have.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:17.481
I'd say you stand a good
chance of finding out

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.906
what a steak feels like
in a microwave oven.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.619
Would you shed a bitter tear?

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.535
No.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:33.040
No point in lying
to you about that.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:38.794
When we find out all we
need to know from her...

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.342
When you give her to me.

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.938
What are you gonna do with her?

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:58.355
John the friendly
orderly will come in.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:02.693
He will greet her, talk
to her, get her to smile.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:07.665
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy 'cause he's the only one who can.

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:13.746
And when John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:19.710
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:24.548
and sending bone
fragments into her brain.

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:30.054
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:33.525
He will know her power.

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.604
And when he dies,

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.732
which I hope is very soon,

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:47.911
perhaps he can take that power
with him into the other world.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:07.384
You are crazy.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:14.932
Mmm.

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:18.269
So, Andy, I've made all the
arrangements for you to go to Hawaii.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:21.021
Good. When am I going?

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.773
Today.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:26.653
- Today?
- Well, 8:00 this evening.

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:28.646
How?

01:29:28.647 --> 01:29:31.657
First class comfort all the way.

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:34.285
I mean, what's taking me?

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.288
You go from here by
helicopter to the base,

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:41.635
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:45.012
Hmm.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:48.850
- 8:00?
- 8:00.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:59.268
You know, that could bite you.

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:01.061
What?

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.235
That snake you're holding.

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:14.074
Christ, how did that get there?

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:18.000
I guess you just picked
it up from a bush.

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:21.373
I want you to contact
that helicopter pilot.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.375
No.

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:25.173
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.299
Contact the helicopter pilot and
tell him you'll be coming along.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.468
No, I won't be coming along.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.189
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:51.904
My daughter will be with us.

01:30:51.905 --> 01:30:53.697
Oh, no.

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:56.575
She can't come. She's
far too dangerous.

01:30:56.576 --> 01:31:01.547
Oh, yeah? Well, now, who do
you think made her dangerous?

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:10.673
My daughter is coming along.

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:13.926
And I don't want you to contradict
me again, do you understand me?

01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:16.555
Yes, of course.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:22.727
You contact the helicopter.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:28.899
We'll let him take us as
far as the army plane.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.069
There has to be a refueling stop
between here and Hawaii, right?

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.946
Yeah, we'll have to
refuel in California.

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:36.245
Yeah.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.742
Okay.

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:42.247
- Now, do you have a paper and a pen?
- Sure.

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:46.084
Here you go.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.128
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:51.046
You're gonna take it to her.

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:53.090
Yes, of course.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.384
<i>Charlie, love.</i>

01:31:55.385 --> 01:31:57.636
<i>First thing, when you
finish reading this,</i>

01:31:57.637 --> 01:31:59.805
<i>flush it down the toilet, okay?</i>

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:03.267
<i>Second thing, if everything
goes the way I'm planning,</i>

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.936
<i>we're gonna be out of here tonight.</i>

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:10.774
<i>Third thing, I want you to
be in the stables at 8:00.</i>

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.110
<i>I'll arrange for
somebody to bring you.</i>

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:16.238
<i>I miss you, Charlie.
I love you so much.</i>

01:32:19.117 --> 01:32:20.617
John!

01:32:20.618 --> 01:32:22.461
Hi, baby.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.539
I have to talk to you.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.383
Yeah, what about?

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.633
I'll tell you in the hall.

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:33.964
They listen here.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.591
Right.

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:41.513
My daddy's found a way
for us to get out of here.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:45.267
I'm supposed to meet him at
the stables at 8:00 tonight.

01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:47.227
That's great. How did he do it?

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.146
I don't know, but
isn't it wonderful?

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:51.482
It's better than that, baby.
It's a miracle. I'll take you.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:56.454
No, you'd get in trouble. I wouldn't
do that to you. You're my friend.

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:02.576
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:05.663
Hi, Charlie.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:11.627
My name's Mike.

01:33:11.628 --> 01:33:13.337
And Captain Hollister
has assigned me

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:15.340
to take you to the stables tonight.

01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:17.174
What time?

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:18.842
Well, let's see.

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:22.554
I'll be back for you about
quarter to 8:00 this evening.

01:33:22.555 --> 01:33:25.849
So, what's going on?

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.435
I asked if I could go
riding at nighttime.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.686
Oh?

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:31.814
Sure, kid, anything you want.

01:33:33.024 --> 01:33:34.274
Bye.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.901
See you later.

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:56.983
Come to me, Charlie.

01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:09.500
Okay, let's check you in here.

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.586
Hey!

01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.922
Anybody here?

01:35:19.923 --> 01:35:21.423
You can go now.

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:23.301
I got the kid with me.

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.972
I said you can go now!

01:35:29.307 --> 01:35:32.142
Get out of here.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:35.317
Can't do it, Charlie.

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.948
Back off. Back off.

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:49.494
Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:58.835
Charlie.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.633
Charlie.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:03.840
John? John?

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.467
Where are you?

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:07.470
I'm up here.

01:36:09.222 --> 01:36:11.850
John...

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:18.855
I'm really glad you're here,
but if anybody found out...

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:20.691
That doesn't matter anymore.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:23.568
The only thing that
matters is you and me.

01:36:23.569 --> 01:36:26.071
How'd you get Charlie to
cooperate with the experiments?

01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:27.698
Rainbird got her to do it.

01:36:27.699 --> 01:36:29.199
Who's Rainbird?

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.702
He's an agent, an exterminator.

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:34.204
Charlene thinks he's
an orderly named John.

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:38.166
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:41.420
- My father should be here any minute now.
- I know.

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:45.266
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.

01:36:46.759 --> 01:36:49.177
That's it. Come on.

01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:51.179
Good.

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:54.599
Good girl. Right...

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.148
- Are you armed?
- Yes.

01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:59.229
Charlie?

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.073
Daddy!

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:18.299
Yeah. Oh.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:20.810
Let me look at you.

01:37:20.836 --> 01:37:23.628
Is it true? Are we
really going away?

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:28.009
Yes, it's true, we're
really going away.

01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:31.930
Baby.

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:36.560
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:39.519
My friend John is here.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.273
The orderly?

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.276
Yeah, he's up there.

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:50.782
Couldn't we take him with
us if he wants to come?

01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:54.618
He's the one that shot us, baby.

01:37:54.619 --> 01:37:56.745
He's the one that brought us here.

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:59.998
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:02.167
No.

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.796
He is with them.

01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:16.181
It isn't true, is it?

01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:17.934
Yes, it's true.

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.936
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

01:38:20.937 --> 01:38:23.355
You tricked me, you lied to me.

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:26.817
No, I just mixed up the
truth a little, Charlie.

01:38:26.818 --> 01:38:29.820
And I did it to save your life.

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:34.449
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, 'cause I can do it.

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:36.660
Oh, I know you can.

01:38:36.661 --> 01:38:39.871
But if you do, you're gonna
burn up an awful lot of horses.

01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:45.503
Can't you hear them? Necromancer's
in one of those stalls.

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.184
No, I'm not gonna do it.

01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:58.850
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:02.607
No! Back off.

01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:13.239
Please, don't. Back off.

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.455
You're not gonna do it.

01:39:22.248 --> 01:39:25.752
Don't. Back off. Back off!

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:32.595
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

01:39:32.758 --> 01:39:38.221
You can't just be let go. I don't think
your father even believes that now.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:40.056
You're dangerous,
Charlie, and you know it.

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.850
That's not my fault.

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:44.311
I know that. I don't care
about that. I never did.

01:39:44.312 --> 01:39:46.563
All I care about is you.

01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:49.738
Now, come up here! Don't
make me shoot your father.

01:39:50.735 --> 01:39:52.736
Don't listen to him, Charlie.

01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:57.115
- You promise he'll be all right?
- I give you my real word.

01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:59.284
Don't do it, baby.

01:39:59.285 --> 01:40:02.087
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.674
Kill him.

01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:36.572
Jump.

01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:38.995
No.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.496
No!

01:40:44.497 --> 01:40:47.457
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.000
Charlie...

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:50.752
Daddy! Daddy!

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.462
You're bleeding.

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:54.465
Charlie!

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:57.347
Daddy!

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:00.558
- Look at me.
- Go on.

01:41:04.976 --> 01:41:07.979
Charlie, look at me.

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:13.234
That's it. So I can see your eyes.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.905
I love you, Charlie.

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:31.460
I love you.

01:41:38.009 --> 01:41:42.137
<i>I say again, Condition Bright
Yellow. This is not a drill.</i>

01:41:42.138 --> 01:41:44.514
<i>Repeat, not a drill.</i>

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.891
<i>Converge on stables. Use caution.</i>

01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:49.645
<i>It's the girl and she's...</i>

01:41:50.813 --> 01:41:54.566
You gotta get away
if you can, Charlie.

01:41:54.567 --> 01:42:00.572
If you have to kill anybody that gets
in your way, I want you to do it.

01:42:00.573 --> 01:42:05.201
You let them know that
this is a war, Charlie.

01:42:05.202 --> 01:42:08.580
You have to get out of here.

01:42:08.581 --> 01:42:11.834
Do it for me.

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:17.756
Do it for me, baby,
do you understand?

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:24.355
You make it. You make it so they can't
ever do anything like this again.

01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:30.435
You'll have to burn
it all down, baby.

01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:33.064
Burn it all down.

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:36.946
Daddy...

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:45.952
Go on. Get outta here
before it all goes up.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:55.711
I can't leave you.

01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:58.926
I can't leave you, Daddy.

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:04.520
Oh...

01:43:04.887 --> 01:43:07.435
I love you, Charlie...

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:13.904
Oh, no, Daddy.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:31.581
Get the door. Ready?

01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:39.137
- Don't move.
- Freeze.

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:14.873
Oh, my God!

01:44:14.874 --> 01:44:18.674
Get her! Get her!

01:44:40.065 --> 01:44:42.693
- Run! Run for it!
- Let's go!

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:18.108
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:11.160
No! No!

01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:31.852
Take cover!

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.103
Take cover!

01:47:25.856 --> 01:47:29.030
No... Stop!

01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:35.408
No! No!

01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:48.094
<i>Attention!</i>

01:47:48.754 --> 01:47:51.677
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>

01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:03.269
<i>Do not move. We're coming down.</i>

01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:34.818
For you, Daddy.

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:53.044
Irv, look who's here.

01:49:53.045 --> 01:49:55.843
Thanks for the ride.

01:50:43.345 --> 01:50:45.847
You'll be safe now, Charlie.

01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:49.058
I'm doing it, Daddy.

01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:51.687
I love you.
