00:17.226 --> 00:18.811
<i>Previously on</i> From...

00:26.110 --> 00:28.112
Nicky, stay with me, okay?

00:28.112 --> 00:30.906
Sheriff Boyd,
I can't take back what I did.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.616
- You killed someone!
- I...

00:32.616 --> 00:34.660
And you left two people
to die in that ambulance!

00:34.660 --> 00:36.579
- I know!
- One of whom

00:36.579 --> 00:38.581
you handcuffed
to a fucking wall!

00:38.581 --> 00:39.999
I am sorry.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.751
Miranda started seeing things.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.586
She said it was like

00:43.586 --> 00:47.840
she'd been chosen
to free the children.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.176
I guess you've
been chosen now, too.

00:50.176 --> 00:52.011
Miranda--
she's the only one who had

00:52.011 --> 00:53.721
a connection to this place
long before she arrived.

00:54.930 --> 00:55.973
What is this?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.601
Did you see three red stones?

00:58.601 --> 01:00.269
How did you...

01:00.269 --> 01:02.188
When I was a little girl,

01:02.188 --> 01:06.525
I would have the same
nightmare over and over again.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.695
It wasn't just Miranda.
I saw this place, too.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.035
<i>If you'd seen
the things I've seen...</i>

01:16.035 --> 01:17.703
What are you talking about?

01:17.703 --> 01:19.455
What do you think
I'm talking about, Boyd?

01:19.455 --> 01:23.125
When me, Julie and Marielle,
wherever we were...

01:23.125 --> 01:26.295
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.379
Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

01:27.379 --> 01:28.798
that can happen to you here.

01:28.798 --> 01:31.550
I feel like something
is watching me.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.552
Is that her?
She looks scary.

01:36.472 --> 01:40.476
<i>Help me, Elgin.
I can save all of you.</i>

01:40.476 --> 01:42.895
Donna, I was told
I can't have kids.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.647
What's happening right now
is medically impossible.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.315
You're gonna have a baby

01:46.315 --> 01:49.318
that you were told
you could never have!

01:49.318 --> 01:51.946
With all you've seen, you can't
wrap your head around a miracle?

02:00.913 --> 02:02.081
I don't see anything.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.332
That's impossible.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.751
You barely looked!
Just keep looking!

02:05.751 --> 02:08.212
You're not pregnant.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.259
And how long have these
cravings been going on for?

02:13.259 --> 02:18.430
Um, about a week maybe?

02:18.430 --> 02:21.851
Guys, what is happening
to me?

02:21.851 --> 02:24.520
Um, well, I mean,
if we were anywhere else,

02:24.520 --> 02:26.397
I'd say your body's
exhibiting signs

02:26.397 --> 02:28.566
of a psychosomatic
pregnancy.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.776
And what is that?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.278
It's a fairly rare condition

02:32.278 --> 02:35.781
where your body
believes it's pregnant.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.783
It shows all the early
signs and symptoms of...

02:37.783 --> 02:39.577
"Hysterical pregnancy."

02:39.577 --> 02:42.288
Isn't that what
they used to call it?

02:42.288 --> 02:46.458
Hey, no one here thinks
you're being hysterical.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.711
It wasn't so long ago

02:48.711 --> 02:51.589
that Boyd had worms under his
skin that no one else could see.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.924
We're not ruling
anything out here.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.802
And, I mean, you very well
could have been pregnant...

02:56.802 --> 03:01.056
I am pregnant.
It's still there! I can feel it.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.142
Here.
Just take a sip of this.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.602
I don't fucking want that!

03:04.602 --> 03:05.978
Okay...

03:05.978 --> 03:07.396
Sorry. I'm sorry.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.814
It's been a long day.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.482
Your body's been
under a lot of stress.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.486
How about you stay the night?
Ellis can stay, too, and--

03:14.486 --> 03:15.738
I wanna go home.
Fatima...

03:15.738 --> 03:17.489
I just wanna go back
to my room.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.074
It's raining outside, okay?
I don't want you walking...

03:19.074 --> 03:21.243
You're worried about
the fucking rain?!

03:21.243 --> 03:22.703
Okay.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.831
- Hey.
- Fatima!

03:25.831 --> 03:28.125
Hey, you go. You should go.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.127
Fatima!

03:30.127 --> 03:31.754
I wanna go home!

03:31.754 --> 03:33.589
I'm gonna go stay
the night at Colony House.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.007
At least I can
get an IV started.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.885
Yeah.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.806
You should've told me about all
of that before the ultrasound.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.017
- It wasn't my place.
- Really, Boyd?

03:45.017 --> 03:47.186
Now you wanna stand
on ceremony?

03:47.186 --> 03:50.272
That was information I could
have used before the exam.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.024
I can't help,
if I'm in the dark!

03:52.024 --> 03:54.109
You wanna yell at me?

03:54.109 --> 03:56.278
Fine, but once you're done,
can we maybe figure out

03:56.278 --> 03:57.488
what we're gonna do now?

03:57.488 --> 03:58.948
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

03:58.948 --> 04:01.533
I don't know what's wrong.
Either way, she...

04:01.533 --> 04:04.036
she has something growing inside
of her that we can't see,

04:04.036 --> 04:05.871
or this place has
finally gotten to her head

04:05.871 --> 04:07.498
and made her believe
she's pregnant.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.874
Okay. Then, how do we
figure out which one it is?

04:08.874 --> 04:11.210
I don't know, Boyd.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.628
Then how do we help her?

04:12.628 --> 04:14.505
I have no fucking clue
how to help her.

04:14.505 --> 04:19.176
Okay. Then, do your fucking job
and figure it out!

You need to talk.

06:36.188 --> 06:40.609
You... talk!
I know you can talk!

06:40.609 --> 06:43.195
You need to talk to me!

06:45.864 --> 06:48.325
Uh, Victor?

06:48.325 --> 06:50.410
It's--it's me.
Can I come in?

07:17.980 --> 07:24.027
Victor,
you can't keep doing this.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.573
You were up all night.
You've been in here all morning.

07:27.573 --> 07:31.952
I could hear you yelling
at that thing from downstairs.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.082
Son...

07:40.294 --> 07:42.546
Now, this isn't healthy.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.507
He needs--he needs to talk,
and he needs to tell me...

07:45.507 --> 07:46.884
- Hey...
- ...tell me what he said.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.094
Yeah, but it's--
it's a doll.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.014
Right? I mean you...

07:52.014 --> 07:54.725
You don't understand.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.019
You weren't there.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.897
Look, Victor,
maybe just take a break...

07:59.897 --> 08:01.440
- I can't do this here!
- No. Why don't...

08:01.440 --> 08:03.108
- I can't do this.
- Victor!

08:03.108 --> 08:04.651
Victor!

08:05.986 --> 08:07.863
Hey. Whatcha workin' on?

08:07.863 --> 08:11.575
Oh, it's just a little...

08:11.575 --> 08:12.701
I'm making this
for Fatima.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.455
Oh!

08:16.455 --> 08:18.874
You know, I thought,
she's been pretty down lately,

08:18.874 --> 08:20.792
and I thought maybe
this might cheer her up.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.630
Well, that's just adorable.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.299
I'm sure she'll love it.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.383
I hope so.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.427
Mm.

09:08.173 --> 09:12.344
You're lucky that
new ambulance came in.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.681
All Kristi had before
was saline in glass bottles.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.808
Yeah, so lucky.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.272
Hey.

09:23.272 --> 09:25.023
I know last night
was a lot.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.651
- Do you?
- I do.

09:27.651 --> 09:32.030
I also know what it's like to
feel violated by this place.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.783
What happened to me
and Julie and Randall,

09:34.783 --> 09:36.868
there are still times
I can feel those bugs

09:36.868 --> 09:38.203
crawling around inside me.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.038
And what do you do?

09:40.038 --> 09:43.333
I remind myself it isn't real,
that it's just fear,

09:43.333 --> 09:45.836
and fear can only
break me if I let it.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.504
This is different.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.964
You don't know that.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.674
Yes, I do!

09:53.844 --> 09:56.388
Maybe you could just try
eating regular food again,

09:56.388 --> 09:57.889
just small bites.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.516
I'm not eating garbage

09:59.516 --> 10:03.061
because I'm afraid or--
or broken.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.356
It's--it's happening
because it's--it's making me.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
Is everything okay?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.241
Yeah, I was just
finishing up.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.709
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

10:40.766 --> 10:42.934
She just cares about you.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.105
Why isn't anybody
listening to me?

10:47.105 --> 10:50.776
It's happening inside of me.
I'm the one experiencing this!

10:50.776 --> 10:52.527
Why is my fucking
point of view

10:52.527 --> 10:54.446
the only one everybody
assumes is wrong?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.782
Nobody's assuming
that you're wrong. Okay?

10:56.782 --> 10:59.368
We're--We're just trying
to see this

10:59.368 --> 11:00.911
from every possible angle
we can.

11:00.911 --> 11:04.373
And you? Do you think this
is all in my head?

11:06.124 --> 11:10.420
Look, ever since that night
at the Sheriff's Station,

11:10.420 --> 11:13.548
when the bus pulled into town,
you--you broke down in my arms.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.133
Do you remember that? You said
you couldn't take it anymore--

11:15.133 --> 11:16.760
This has nothing
to do with that!

11:16.760 --> 11:18.595
Okay, so then tell me
what am I supposed to do?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.305
Believe me!

11:20.305 --> 11:21.640
Look, look, okay.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.308
Just... Ow!

11:23.308 --> 11:24.476
Ugh!

11:24.476 --> 11:25.811
Look!

11:25.811 --> 11:27.646
Just...

11:27.646 --> 11:30.607
I have been measuring every
single day since I found out.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.150
- You just need to stop.
- And my stomach...

11:32.150 --> 11:33.944
And my stomach
is getting bigger!

11:33.944 --> 11:36.321
- Baby, it's not--
- Look! Look at it! Look!

11:36.321 --> 11:37.906
If this is in my head,
how do you--

11:37.906 --> 11:40.075
how do you explain
my body changing?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.451
- I don't know.
- Ellis...

11:41.451 --> 11:45.330
whatever is inside me,
it's getting stronger.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.166
The--the fucking cravings,
they're getting stronger.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.501
Please.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.753
- I'm angry all the time.
- It's okay.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.005
If there's nothing there,

11:54.005 --> 12:00.095
if the baby isn't real,
that means that it's me.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.184
I told her
it was a miracle.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.020
Yeah, we all, uh...

12:09.020 --> 12:10.856
We all got
a little excited.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.277
You're sure there's no way
Kristi missed anything?

12:15.277 --> 12:18.697
Donna,
there was nothing there.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.032
Nothing that showed up
on that machine anyway.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.703
So, the way Kristi sees it,
either there's something there,

12:24.703 --> 12:26.830
like the worms
that were under my skin,

12:26.830 --> 12:30.542
or this place
finally got to her.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.003
Like Abby.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.381
Yeah, like Abby.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.510
Look,
if you're thinking about

12:40.510 --> 12:42.554
things you could
have done different--

12:42.554 --> 12:45.891
- No, it's not that.
- Well, it should be.

12:45.891 --> 12:49.394
Look, if it's
some kind of fucked-up

12:49.394 --> 12:51.563
worms-under-the-skin
type thing,

12:51.563 --> 12:53.940
then that's a bridge
we're gonna have to cross.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.361
But if it's psychological,

12:58.361 --> 13:01.865
if she's anywhere
near the place Abby was in,

13:01.865 --> 13:04.743
then we need to figure out
a way to bring her back.

13:04.743 --> 13:08.497
Okay, well, let's just...

13:08.497 --> 13:11.750
make sure this
stays between us.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.336
And then what?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.505
I'm gonna have a talk
with Kristi later.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.924
Hopefully,
she'll have had time to, uh...

13:18.924 --> 13:20.300
To what?

13:21.510 --> 13:24.012
I don't know. Look.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.515
Look, I...
I'm just telling you

13:26.515 --> 13:29.351
'cause you and I promised not
to keep secrets from each other,

13:29.351 --> 13:31.102
and she's
living under your roof.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.146
Yeah, yeah.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.193
About that...
While we're figuring it out,

13:38.193 --> 13:41.613
I don't think it's a good idea
that they stay at Colony House.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.948
What?!

13:42.948 --> 13:44.741
Look, I am gonna
be there for them,

13:44.741 --> 13:47.536
for you,
every step of the way.

13:47.536 --> 13:51.289
But the truth is, there are
two possibilities here,

13:51.289 --> 13:53.542
and each one poses
a different kind of threat

13:53.542 --> 13:55.752
to the people of that house.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.964
I have to think about
everyone here, Boyd,

13:58.964 --> 14:00.882
no matter how much
I wanna help you guys.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.261
Okay, I, uh...
I guess I can, uh...

14:04.261 --> 14:06.555
make some space at
the Sheriff's Station.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.390
- I gotta...
- Oh, Boyd, come on.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.558
No, we're good!
We're good!

14:09.558 --> 14:12.102
I'm not saying
it has to be today.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.271
I'm just saying it's something
we have to consider.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.107
I get it!
You're not wrong! Okay?

14:17.107 --> 14:19.901
You and me, we're okay.
Just... I just...

14:19.901 --> 14:22.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.498
This one's all right.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.921
Let me help you.
If we get going soon,

14:39.921 --> 14:42.465
we should be able to make
pretty good time back to town.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.843
Whatever was
banging around last night

14:44.843 --> 14:48.096
sure as hell didn't sound like
those things back in town.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.973
Whatever it was,

14:49.973 --> 14:52.142
I'll be glad when
this place is in the rearview.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.810
Is this what was in your dream?

14:53.810 --> 14:54.811
Yeah.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.858
What the hell?

15:00.942 --> 15:02.652
Tabitha?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.154
Dad!

15:05.947 --> 15:08.033
Hey. What happened?

15:08.033 --> 15:10.535
- Nothing.
- Where's Julie?

15:10.535 --> 15:12.704
Oh, she's--she's fine.
Everything's okay.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.164
What the hell's going on?

15:14.164 --> 15:15.874
Listen, it's okay.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.460
All right? It was my idea.
She needed to come out here.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.711
Why?

15:19.711 --> 15:21.796
Mom saw this place
when she was little,

15:21.796 --> 15:23.715
just like Victor's mom.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.966
What?

15:24.966 --> 15:27.052
Jim!
You coming or staying?

15:27.052 --> 15:32.015
Uh, you guys go on ahead.
We'll--we'll catch up.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.350
Suit yourself.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.809
Come on.
Let's go look around.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.603
Let's go.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.030
Hey.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.740
You moving in?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.742
Yeah, I asked Kristi
if I could spend the night.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.035
Why?

15:52.035 --> 15:53.328
My whole family's
at the settlement.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.996
So?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.207
So, it's fucking creepy
in that house by myself.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.416
What's wrong with you?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.418
- Nothing.
- So, we got high on the bus

16:00.418 --> 16:01.920
together and now you're
gonna be all weird towards me?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.089
I'm not being weird.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.340
Where you going?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.883
For a walk.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.426
- Want some company?
- Nope.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.719
'Kay, let me put
my bag inside.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.201
Oh, hey. Uh...

20:03.828 --> 20:05.705
Sorry, we're not, uh...

20:07.498 --> 20:09.500
We don't really
serve food here anymore,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.502
if that's what
you're hoping for.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.921
Why is there a diner here?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.505
Sorry?

20:14.505 --> 20:16.257
And why is there
a Sheriff's Station

20:16.257 --> 20:18.009
that looks like a post office?

20:18.009 --> 20:20.845
Or a goddamn, uh,
travel agency sign?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.681
I mean, what kind of psycho
built this place?

20:23.681 --> 20:25.850
You want--you want me to
go over them one at a time

20:25.850 --> 20:27.352
or you want me--

20:27.352 --> 20:30.021
I wanna know why no one's
asking those questions.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.232
We did.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.486
And?

20:40.615 --> 20:42.867
Want some tea?

20:42.867 --> 20:46.496
This place is creepy.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.374
Yeah, it certainly is.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.587
Who do you think
lived out here?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.800
I don't know.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.427
What do you think
happened to them?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.389
Maybe, uh--
maybe they got out.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.641
You know,
maybe they went home.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.477
Just careful where
you're stepping, 'kay?

21:09.477 --> 21:10.728
Why?

21:10.728 --> 21:12.355
Bear traps.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.065
Seriously.

21:14.065 --> 21:17.068
I'm just saying, given
everything that's happened,

21:17.068 --> 21:18.528
there might be a part of you

21:18.528 --> 21:22.365
that wants so badly
for all of this to make sense.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.075
Do you think
I'm making this up?

21:24.075 --> 21:25.994
Of course not.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.746
You had a dream,
a terrifying dream,

21:28.746 --> 21:29.998
when you were little.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.875
This wasn't just
a random nightmare, Jim.

21:32.875 --> 21:38.589
This was a dream I had,
over and over again, for months,

21:38.589 --> 21:41.926
and every night,
I would wake up screaming.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.179
So, when I tell you
that the totems here

21:45.179 --> 21:48.349
are the same ones
that I saw in my dream...

21:48.349 --> 21:50.768
what do you want me to do?
Give up? Stop trying?

21:50.768 --> 21:52.395
I don't know.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.733
Look, Tabby, this place,

21:56.733 --> 21:58.609
I thought
I had it all figured out,

21:58.609 --> 22:01.362
and I almost got
Donna killed.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.365
Sara? She heard voices,

22:04.365 --> 22:06.034
and she tried
to murder our child.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.245
- But that's different.
- Why?

22:09.245 --> 22:12.749
Those things happened once
we got here, but my dream...

22:12.749 --> 22:15.626
I was a kid!

22:15.626 --> 22:18.713
I know you're scared.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.923
I'm scared, too.

22:20.923 --> 22:22.592
But these things
are happening to me.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.303
I-I can't
pretend they're not.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.929
One way or another,

22:26.929 --> 22:28.931
I need to know.

22:33.728 --> 22:39.317
Okay.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.780
So, my mom is convinced

22:43.780 --> 22:46.407
that these creepy children
she keeps seeing need her help.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.826
And my dad's all,
like, freaked out

22:48.826 --> 22:50.787
'cause the last time
he went down a rabbit hole

22:50.787 --> 22:54.123
about this place,
he almost got everyone killed,

22:54.123 --> 22:56.167
including this one
complete idiot

22:56.167 --> 22:59.462
who tied Donna to a tree
in the middle of the woods.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.172
Yeah.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.757
Are you listening?

23:02.757 --> 23:04.008
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.302
Your mom and the kids,
rabbit stuff...

23:06.302 --> 23:09.472
What are you looking for?

23:09.472 --> 23:12.350
What? Uh... chaga.
It's a mushroom.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.185
Grows in cold weather.

23:14.185 --> 23:17.021
Marielle and Kristi are on some
holistic foraging trip.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.107
So, where were you going,
on the bus?

23:19.107 --> 23:22.193
Detroit.
Like everyone else.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.195
Why?

23:24.195 --> 23:27.532
To buy a car, so I didn't have
to ride the fucking bus anymore.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.868
- That true?
- No.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.787
I never even got
my learner's permit.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.664
What?

23:34.664 --> 23:37.375
Yeah, you're supposed
to get it when you're 15.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.877
Everything kinda stopped
after Thomas died.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.713
That's your brother?

23:42.713 --> 23:45.800
Yeah. My dad was supposed
to take me to the DMV,

23:45.800 --> 23:48.553
but we never
got back from our trip.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.140
Uh...

23:52.140 --> 23:55.309
All right, uh...
Come with me.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.853
Where are you going?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.771
Can you just come on?

24:02.233 --> 24:06.237
You have to understand,
uh, things are--

24:06.237 --> 24:08.990
things are a little different
when you first get here.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.410
I mean, you show up,
and you think to yourself,

24:12.410 --> 24:15.538
"I'm gonna figure this out.
All these other people,

24:15.538 --> 24:19.041
they may have given up,
they may have accepted it.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.879
But me?
I'm gonna figure this out.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.173
I'm gonna be the one
who gets to go home."

24:25.173 --> 24:27.091
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.929
Completely normal. But, uh...

24:31.929 --> 24:35.600
given some time,
it'll pass.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.685
Pass.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.562
Sorry. No, that's the thing.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.022
The whole idea of just
throwing up your hands

24:41.022 --> 24:45.276
and saying, "Oh, well, I tried"?
That's not how I'm built.

24:45.276 --> 24:49.155
Right. You're not the type to
just accept the world as it is.

24:50.615 --> 24:51.616
What?

24:51.616 --> 24:54.118
I've had this
conversation before,

24:54.118 --> 24:56.245
and I've been
on the other side of it.

24:56.245 --> 25:00.124
The thing you come
to realize is that...

25:00.124 --> 25:04.587
every...
question you're asking

25:04.587 --> 25:06.464
has been asked before.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.424
Every theory that you have,

25:08.424 --> 25:12.511
someone else has had
before you, and at some point,

25:14.222 --> 25:17.433
...you either adapt
or you lose your mind.

25:18.726 --> 25:22.396
So, that's what you did?
You adapted?

25:22.396 --> 25:24.649
Well, me,
I didn't really have a choice.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.317
When I first got here,

25:26.317 --> 25:28.778
I was so busy taking care
of my dad that I was just--

25:28.778 --> 25:30.821
Your... dad?

25:30.821 --> 25:35.159
He passed away.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.578
And your mom--she...

25:37.578 --> 25:39.622
she used to run the diner?

25:39.622 --> 25:42.083
Mm-hmm.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.126
You lost
both your parents here?

25:44.126 --> 25:46.295
Yeah.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.673
I'm really sorry.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.508
Thanks.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.344
You're... welcome.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.972
Um, what about, uh,
what about you?

25:55.972 --> 25:58.808
You have any--you have
a family back home?

25:58.808 --> 26:00.142
Uh, no, not--

26:00.142 --> 26:02.520
Um... not really.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.813
Right.

26:05.356 --> 26:09.694
Um, the good news is that
we have the talismans,

26:09.694 --> 26:11.362
and they keep us
safe at night.

26:11.362 --> 26:14.115
So, you know... I mean,
that wasn't always the case.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.617
What the hell did
people do before?

26:16.617 --> 26:18.202
They just...

26:18.202 --> 26:20.329
tried to hide
as best they could.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.039
Jesus.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.874
Yeah. I wasn't here then.

26:23.874 --> 26:27.503
There aren't
many people left who were.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.048
Where did they come from?
The talismans.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.300
Uh...

26:32.300 --> 26:34.844
Boyd. He, uh...

26:34.844 --> 26:38.222
found 'em out
in the forest one night.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.391
So, that's why he acts like
the God king of the world.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.685
It's, uh, not like that.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.395
You sure?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.230
I mean, no offense,
the guy's kind of a dick.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.065
You, uh, didn't exactly

26:48.065 --> 26:51.861
meet him under the best
of circumstances.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.529
He took my gun.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.406
Can you blame him?

26:55.406 --> 26:57.575
You know, I'm gonna have to
carry the weight of that--

26:57.575 --> 27:00.703
of what I did,
for the rest of my life.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.039
I know that.
But for him to f--

27:07.918 --> 27:10.671
Hey, you know they have

27:10.671 --> 27:12.340
tons of fresh clothes
up at Colony House.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.425
You'd be a lot
more comfortable, if you--

27:14.425 --> 27:18.054
You know, I don't want your
fucking fresh clothes, okay?!

27:18.054 --> 27:21.265
No offense, really!
I don't want your tea.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.435
And I don't want
your adapt-or-die philosophy.

27:24.435 --> 27:28.272
I don't plan on getting
comfortable here, okay?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.274
I'm gonna figure the...

27:34.820 --> 27:37.365
Yeah, they uh...
They do that sometimes.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.788
Is that something else
you get comfortable with?

27:43.788 --> 27:45.289
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, child ♪</i>

27:45.289 --> 27:46.624
<i>♪ Things are
gonna get easier... ♪</i>

27:46.624 --> 27:49.794
Look, thanks for the tea.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.546
Uh, you didn't even...

27:52.546 --> 27:54.215
Excuse me.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.800
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, child ♪</i>

27:55.800 --> 27:58.386
<i>♪ Things are gonna
Get easier ♪</i>

27:58.386 --> 27:59.804
She's taking it well.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.305
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, child ♪</i>

28:01.305 --> 28:03.724
Yeah.
Uh, you need something?

28:03.724 --> 28:05.810
<i>♪ Someday... ♪</i>

28:05.810 --> 28:08.646
Yeah.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.231
Yeah, actually.

28:10.231 --> 28:14.985
Um, I was hoping
I could talk to you

28:14.985 --> 28:17.613
about reopening the diner.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.991
<i>♪ Yeah, we'll walk in the rays
of a beautiful sun ♪</i>

29:03.951 --> 29:06.245
Is this really where it happens?

29:18.424 --> 29:19.550
Hi.

29:19.550 --> 29:20.843
Can I go in your basement?

29:20.843 --> 29:22.470
Why?

29:22.470 --> 29:25.931
Because I need him
to tell me a secret.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.648
'Kay, isn't this,
like, for emergencies?

29:34.648 --> 29:38.736
This is an emergency.
Just get in. Come on.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.029
Let's go.

29:43.824 --> 29:44.867
All right.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.369
Ahh. Okay.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.666
All right. Bingo.

29:52.666 --> 29:56.045
What you wanna do...
You gotta pay attention.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.175
You turn it on,
you press in the clutch, okay?

30:01.175 --> 30:03.552
Make sure this
has been shifted,

30:03.552 --> 30:05.888
then you're gonna
ease off the clutch, right?

30:07.598 --> 30:08.641
Voilà.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.750
Henry.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.461
You need something?

30:37.461 --> 30:39.797
I... could use a drink.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.801
You know what?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.515
So could I.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.185
Let's go.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.662
Who's in there?

31:15.165 --> 31:17.042
Hello?

31:28.012 --> 31:29.847
What the fuck are you doing?

31:29.847 --> 31:32.182
You took my gun.
I want it back.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.727
You... Get out.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.647
Fine. Give me my gun,
and I'll be on my way.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.150
Hey, hey, hey! I don't
have time for this today!

31:41.150 --> 31:43.527
I don't give a shit
what you have time for!

31:43.527 --> 31:45.321
You shot someone!

31:45.321 --> 31:47.698
A girl is dead
because you panicked!

31:47.698 --> 31:50.034
Yeah, I panicked because
I was being chased in the dark

31:50.034 --> 31:52.995
by things that should only
exist in a fucking nightmare!

31:52.995 --> 31:54.872
Well, they exist here,

31:54.872 --> 31:57.875
and they're going to
continue to exist.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.002
So, until you prove
that you can handle that,

32:00.002 --> 32:01.378
there is not a chance
in hell

32:01.378 --> 32:03.631
you're getting anywhere
close to a loaded gun!

32:05.633 --> 32:09.011
I don't have to
prove shit to you.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.721
You see this?

32:10.721 --> 32:12.806
I'm a cop.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.391
A real one,

32:14.391 --> 32:16.727
not just walking around
in some hand-me-down blazer,

32:16.727 --> 32:18.395
playing make-believe.

32:18.395 --> 32:22.441
Right. And when did you
get out of the academy?

32:23.776 --> 32:26.236
Two days? Three?

32:26.236 --> 32:27.905
That's none of your business.

32:29.323 --> 32:32.076
That's where you are wrong.

32:32.076 --> 32:34.411
Everything about you
is my business.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.413
This place is my business.
You know why?

32:36.413 --> 32:37.915
Why?

32:37.915 --> 32:40.751
Because I'm the one who
makes sure people stay safe.

32:40.751 --> 32:44.421
I am the one who
keeps people alive!

32:44.421 --> 32:48.092
Wow. Well, from what I hear,

32:48.092 --> 32:50.928
you've been doing a pretty
shit job of that lately.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.972
Get the fuck out!

32:58.185 --> 33:00.938
Fucking place...

33:00.938 --> 33:01.980
Hey--

33:05.859 --> 33:09.238
Give me... my gun.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.536
You want your gun?

33:15.536 --> 33:17.413
Correct.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.089
You want your gun.

33:50.237 --> 33:51.780
There's your gun.

33:53.991 --> 33:56.869
You get your bullets when
I think you deserve them.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.628
Hey!

34:09.423 --> 34:15.179
The next time you come in here
without my permission,

34:15.179 --> 34:16.847
you and me
are gonna have a problem.

34:16.847 --> 34:20.476
Whatever you say, "Sheriff."

34:28.066 --> 34:29.568
This fucking kid...

34:31.278 --> 34:33.781
I'd ask you what
you were drinking,

34:33.781 --> 34:35.824
but the menu here's
kinda limited.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.291
Everything going
all right with Victor?

34:44.291 --> 34:47.419
Things are going, um...

34:51.465 --> 34:53.425
No, I don't
think they are.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.890
You okay?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.892
Yeah.

35:04.394 --> 35:08.398
I stood there today
in his room,

35:08.398 --> 35:11.485
and I...

35:11.485 --> 35:14.822
...I had a thought I'll never
forgive myself for.

35:14.822 --> 35:18.826
I wished
I had never come here,

35:18.826 --> 35:22.538
I wished Tabitha
had never found me,

35:22.538 --> 35:27.543
because it was easier
when I thought he was dead.

35:28.919 --> 35:32.548
It was only for a second.

35:32.548 --> 35:35.300
What kind of father
thinks that about his child?

35:41.974 --> 35:44.268
Here.

35:44.268 --> 35:45.769
Yeah.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.153
Mm.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.577
Are these the same ones
from your dream?

36:05.664 --> 36:08.000
It's not just the stones;
it's everything. It's...

36:10.335 --> 36:12.087
It's how it feels.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.176
I still remember the fear
when I was running.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.978
I started over there

36:27.978 --> 36:32.065
and came to hide
behind the rocks.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.483
Which one?

36:37.905 --> 36:39.948
This one.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.992
And then what?

36:41.992 --> 36:43.785
Whatever was
making everyone scream

36:43.785 --> 36:46.997
was on the other side
of this rock.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.999
And I would look up and...

36:50.417 --> 36:52.336
What?

36:52.336 --> 36:54.588
I would wake up
every single time.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.465
Okay, let's say you

36:56.465 --> 36:59.760
actually did see this
place before we came here.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.012
Yeah, like--
like Miranda did.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.765
How does that help?

37:04.765 --> 37:06.475
Maybe Aristotle got it wrong.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.229
You know, free will
and determinism, it's...

37:13.106 --> 37:16.693
Miranda said she was chosen.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.862
Right?

37:18.862 --> 37:23.408
If seeing this place,
you know, visions, dreams...

37:24.743 --> 37:27.287
...if that's the proof...

37:27.287 --> 37:30.207
and you saw this place
as a child?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.335
You never really had
a chance, did you?

37:33.335 --> 37:36.463
What--
What do you mean?

37:36.463 --> 37:41.134
If fate exists,
if you were destined

37:41.134 --> 37:45.055
to come to this place
since you were a child...

37:46.974 --> 37:48.392
...then, one way or another,

37:48.392 --> 37:50.602
you were always gonna come
to that tree in the road.

38:00.570 --> 38:04.241
How's Fatima doing?

38:04.241 --> 38:06.410
Oh.

38:06.410 --> 38:10.414
She's, uh... She's good.

38:10.414 --> 38:13.333
You know, we're just taking
things one step at a time.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.419
You don't have to pretend.

38:15.419 --> 38:19.214
She told me about the rotten
food, about the cravings.

38:19.214 --> 38:23.051
I realize
you don't know me very well.

38:23.051 --> 38:26.304
But if you need anything,
I'm here.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.771
We did an ultrasound
last night.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.441
There was a machine
on the ambulance.

38:37.441 --> 38:40.277
And? Is the baby okay?

38:40.277 --> 38:41.611
There is no baby.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.780
When Kristi examined her,
she looked.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.949
There was nothing there.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.951
So, it's either there's
something inside of her

38:47.951 --> 38:51.038
that isn't human,
that a machine can't see,

38:51.038 --> 38:53.457
or this place
has just broken her mind.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.293
I just...
I can't lose her. I just...

38:57.794 --> 38:59.880
You haven't lost her.

38:59.880 --> 39:03.925
She's still here, Ellis.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.261
A good friend
once said to me,

39:06.261 --> 39:09.306
"Enjoy every moment,

39:09.306 --> 39:12.642
and don't grieve the living
before they're gone."

39:12.642 --> 39:15.312
And that's
what I told my family

39:15.312 --> 39:17.522
when I got my diagnosis.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.402
Are you afraid?

39:22.402 --> 39:23.820
Of dying?

39:23.820 --> 39:27.365
Sure, at first, I was.

39:28.658 --> 39:31.161
And then I got angry.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.247
And one day, I realized
just how small life is,

39:34.247 --> 39:38.001
how it all goes by
so fast.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.629
You start to wonder
how it could be anything

39:40.629 --> 39:43.173
but the beginning
of some grand adventure,

39:43.173 --> 39:46.093
or maybe it's the middle,

39:46.093 --> 39:48.178
but I don't think
it's the end.

39:48.178 --> 39:51.348
Not anymore.
Once I realized that,

39:51.348 --> 39:53.558
things didn't seem so scary.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.854
None of us
get to stay forever.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.607
I don't need forever.
I just...

40:00.607 --> 40:05.195
Whatever I can do,
whatever you need...

40:05.195 --> 40:09.699
well, it may not be much,
but I'm here.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.702
Mm?

40:14.538 --> 40:18.542
I'm sorry, but why?
I mean, you barely know us.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.961
I'm old, and I have cancer.

40:20.961 --> 40:24.381
I like a good love story.
That work for you?

40:26.466 --> 40:30.637
Yeah. Yeah, that--
that works fine.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.514
Hm. Come on.

41:10.427 --> 41:13.555
Help!

41:13.555 --> 41:14.973
Help!

41:18.393 --> 41:20.854
Help. Help.

41:20.854 --> 41:22.230
Help!

41:23.690 --> 41:24.608
Fatima?

41:26.276 --> 41:28.028
Hey, babe, what's wrong?
What happened?

41:30.071 --> 41:31.781
What's...
What's happening to me?

41:33.783 --> 41:35.952
Oh, God...

41:35.952 --> 41:37.704
I can't...
Ellis?

41:37.704 --> 41:40.290
It's fine.

41:42.751 --> 41:46.087
Hey. It's okay.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.676
Whoo!
Goddamn, this feels good.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.804
So, am I gonna
get a turn or what?

41:54.804 --> 41:56.890
All right.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.975
Okay, okay.
A promise is a promise.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.647
Fuck.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.607
What's going on?

42:05.607 --> 42:08.401
Nothing, nothing.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.028
Uh, the, um...

42:11.404 --> 42:13.573
Son of a bitch.

42:18.245 --> 42:19.329
Yeah, fuck you!

42:19.329 --> 42:20.997
What are you doing?

42:20.997 --> 42:22.791
- You don't see 'em?
- See what?

42:22.791 --> 42:24.584
It's the fucking--
it's the fucking bugs!

42:24.584 --> 42:26.086
- The ones that...
- No.

42:26.086 --> 42:28.171
No, no, no, no, no.

42:29.422 --> 42:30.924
Randall!
- Fuck you, man!

42:30.924 --> 42:32.842
Randall, stop!

42:34.636 --> 42:35.971
Randall!

42:35.971 --> 42:37.347
Get the fuck off me!

42:37.347 --> 42:38.640
Randall, hey!
What are you...

42:38.640 --> 42:39.975
Get the fuck off!

42:41.226 --> 42:42.894
What the fuck?
What just happened?

42:46.273 --> 42:48.191
Just go the fuck home.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.651
- Hey!
- Get off me!

42:51.528 --> 42:53.905
- Randall! Come back!
- Go home, Julie!

42:55.907 --> 42:57.450
Hey! Put those back! Ellis!

42:57.450 --> 42:59.661
Look! She's in pain,
okay? I need to do something!

42:59.661 --> 43:00.996
- Ellis! Hey!
- Thank you for all your help...

43:00.996 --> 43:02.706
Hey, hey,
what the hell is going on?

43:02.706 --> 43:05.208
Your son decided to come in here
and root the medicine cabinet!

43:05.208 --> 43:06.543
Yeah, that's because that
ambulance has plenty

43:06.543 --> 43:08.003
of emergency medications!

43:08.003 --> 43:09.379
This isn't fucking aspirin
we're talking about!

43:09.379 --> 43:10.797
Things that can make
her stay calm, okay?

43:10.797 --> 43:12.215
These are powerful
anti-psychotics!

43:12.215 --> 43:14.050
You have no idea what kind
of damage that could cause!

43:14.050 --> 43:16.553
Okay, so what then? What? What?
We're just gonna do nothing?

43:16.553 --> 43:18.054
Okay, you're not the one
that's sitting there,

43:18.054 --> 43:21.057
- watching her go to pieces!
- No, I'm the doctor, okay?

43:21.057 --> 43:23.310
And it is my job to use my brain
and not my emotions

43:23.310 --> 43:25.395
- when making decisions.
- All right.

43:25.395 --> 43:30.191
Ellis, those pills in your hands
could make things a lot worse.

43:30.191 --> 43:32.485
Give them back to me.

43:32.485 --> 43:33.945
Give her the bottle.

43:36.239 --> 43:38.533
Give her the fucking bottle, man.

43:47.834 --> 43:50.378
Ellis! Ellis! Hey!

43:50.378 --> 43:51.588
What?!

43:51.588 --> 43:53.590
Look, I know
you're scared, man.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.383
What am I supposed to do?!

43:55.383 --> 43:57.052
Huh?!

43:57.052 --> 43:59.095
Tell me, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?!

43:59.095 --> 44:00.930
- I don't know.
- Okay, I-I saw it!

44:00.930 --> 44:03.350
I saw what happened
with your fucking worms!

44:03.350 --> 44:04.851
And I saw
what happened to...

44:04.851 --> 44:06.811
I saw what happened
to Mom when she...

44:12.192 --> 44:15.362
Which fucking nightmare
am I supposed to be afraid of?

44:15.362 --> 44:17.280
Which?

44:19.032 --> 44:21.368
You know,
she's fucking falling apart,

44:21.368 --> 44:23.244
right in front of me,
and I don't know what to do.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.080
I can't do anything
to help her.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.041
Dad, I don't know
how to help her.

44:28.041 --> 44:32.796
- It's all right.
- Please...

44:32.796 --> 44:35.632
Yeah.
- Don't let this happen, Dad.

44:35.632 --> 44:37.467
Okay.

44:37.467 --> 44:39.386
I...

44:39.386 --> 44:41.346
It's just, uh...

44:51.648 --> 44:53.817
Randall?

45:01.616 --> 45:03.535
Randall?!

45:16.089 --> 45:19.008
Julie!

45:19.008 --> 45:20.969
What the hell is that?

45:23.430 --> 45:25.223
I don't know.

45:28.435 --> 45:29.894
I don't know.

45:32.856 --> 45:34.774
What happened
to you back there?

45:34.774 --> 45:36.734
Why did you just
run off like that?

45:38.111 --> 45:39.779
I'll tell you
on the way back.

45:39.779 --> 45:42.323
- Come on.
- Wait.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.534
Do you feel that?

45:44.534 --> 45:48.580
Julie, we should go.

45:50.039 --> 45:52.041
No.
No, I wanna check it out.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.543
Hey, hey, stop.

45:54.878 --> 45:56.004
Stop.

45:56.004 --> 45:58.214
You do. You feel it.

46:01.301 --> 46:02.760
I don't feel shit.

46:03.928 --> 46:04.888
Okay?

46:04.888 --> 46:07.140
It's gonna be dark soon.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.226
We gotta get that van
back to Colony House.

46:10.226 --> 46:13.188
All right, let's just...

46:13.188 --> 46:14.772
let's just go.

46:16.983 --> 46:18.735
Please?

47:02.946 --> 47:04.906
Fatima?

47:04.906 --> 47:07.116
Ooh, Fatima!

47:07.116 --> 47:08.910
Listen to me.

47:08.910 --> 47:10.370
- You're not alone.
- Please go.

47:10.370 --> 47:12.205
- I'm gonna help you!
- Get off me.

47:12.205 --> 47:15.291
Everything is gonna be okay.

47:15.291 --> 47:16.793
- Just go!
- It's gonna be okay.

47:16.793 --> 47:18.336
I said go!

47:20.713 --> 47:23.925
I'm so...
Tillie, Tillie...

47:23.925 --> 47:27.762
No, no. No, no, Tillie, Tillie,
Tillie! I'm so sorry.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.138
I didn't mean it! I...

47:29.138 --> 47:33.810
Help! Help!

47:35.395 --> 47:37.814
You have to run.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.113
Ellis, what have I done?

47:45.113 --> 47:46.990
What have I done?!
