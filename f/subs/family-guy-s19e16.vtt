I'm glad you're finally getting
your hair cut, Peter.

00:36.786 --> 00:40.040
You were starting to look like
that Bongo from The Beatles.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.083
I am so excited for you to meet Jerry.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.710
He's been cutting my hair for decades.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.713
-I'm like family here.
-How do you do?

00:46.796 --> 00:48.465
Well, that's a fine "how do you do."

00:48.548 --> 00:50.633
-I have a 12:00 with Jerry.
-Oh.

Well, I'm sorry to tell you
this, Mr. Griffin,

00:53.219 --> 00:55.889
but your barber Jerry has passed away.

00:55.972 --> 00:58.641
What? When?

00:58.725 --> 01:00.810
-Recently.
-Jerry.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.729
Oh, that's someone else.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.648
But I can assure you,
we have a wonderful team

of lesbians wearing all black
for you to choose from.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.362
No! I want Jerry.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.365
Come on, Peter, it's just a haircut.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.076
Come on, get up. You're embarrassing me.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.261

08:31.344 --> 08:33.805
It's funny, but I-I have no memory

08:49.029 --> 08:50.989
Good news is we'll know exactly how far

08:51.072 --> 08:52.282
to pull in when we park.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.117

09:20.393 --> 09:22.395
Okay, Brian, you can do this.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.230
The Griffins are still your family.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.733

-Sure is.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.746
We thought we'd never see you again.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.539

09:43.333 --> 09:45.085
Um, uh, no, thanks.

Wow, this place is incredible.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.180
These say "Henderson."
Did you write all these?

09:57.263 --> 10:00.517
Yep. I've written one more book
than James Patterson.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.478
He writes one, I write one more.
That's sort of my thing.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.523
Oh, and it looks like you got
some of my favorites over here.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.900
1984.
Chilling.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.902
-Could happen, right?
-Which part?

10:10.985 --> 10:14.322
Oh, just all of it.
You know, the... just, the year.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.534
Are you saying the year 1984 could happen?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.994
Ah, and Sense and Sensibility.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.373
Very similar words.
But there is a difference there.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.335
Well, I think Ms. Austen meant "sense"
as in the rational mind,

10:27.419 --> 10:30.463
and "sensibility" as in one's preferences,
or irrational mind,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.716
so it's kind of a winking
tug-of-war at work.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.843
(chuckles)

10:34.926 --> 10:38.263
Do you have Jaws here?
I-I'd like to talk about Jaws.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.181
-By Peter Benchley?
-(chuckles)

10:40.265 --> 10:43.476
No.
No, by Steven Spielberg.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.358
Well, that was all pretty unexpected.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.819
The Hendersons were actually amazing.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.321
I can totally see where I get
my literary chops from.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.157
Ah, uh, can't hear you...

12:29.207 --> 12:32.168
He said I was lucky
I was the only one who applied.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.920
You're being too modest.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.674

12:37.757 --> 12:40.093
Anyway, I've already been fired
for touching myself

made lemonade.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.514

12:44.597 --> 12:46.808
Well, to be fair, the hot dogs look
