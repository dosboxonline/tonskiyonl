02:04.310 --> 02:05.770
What am I working on?

02:06.390 --> 02:08.979
Something that will
change the world...

02:09.190 --> 02:10.940
...and human life as we know it.

02:11.310 --> 02:14.860
Change it a lot or just a bit?
Be more specific.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.030
You want me to be more
specific here with...

02:18.240 --> 02:21.660
...half the scientific
community eavesdropping?

02:22.320 --> 02:23.410
Where else?

02:25.200 --> 02:28.080
You could come back to my lab.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.620
I'll make cappuccino.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.960
I have a Faema of my own.

02:33.170 --> 02:35.920
It's not the dilettante's
plastic model.

02:36.210 --> 02:40.470
It's a restaurant espresso machine
with an eagle on top.

02:41.470 --> 02:44.050
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't get out much.

02:44.390 --> 02:47.600
- You can tell that?
- Yes.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.820
You're making a mistake.
I think you really want to talk to me.

03:01.110 --> 03:04.030
Sorry. I have three other interviews
before this party is over.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.910
But they don't have something
that will change the world.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.490
They say they do.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.460
Yeah but they're lying.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.080
I'm not.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.510
Are you sick?

03:21.170 --> 03:23.890
No... Sure.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.680
You're not a very good drunk.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.020
No, I'm always like this.
It's the...

03:30.770 --> 03:35.690
...motion sickness. When I was a kid,
I puked on my tricycle.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.860
I hate vehicles.

03:39.070 --> 03:40.650
Should I drive slowly?

03:40.900 --> 03:43.450
No. Turn left.
We're almost there.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.090
This is it?

04:02.420 --> 04:05.890
It's cleaner on the inside.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.850
Please.

04:47.510 --> 04:50.470
Listen.
Maybe this is a bad idea.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.310
Too late.

04:53.890 --> 04:57.520
You've already seen them.
You can't leave here alive.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.820
I haven't seen anything.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.570
Those.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.580
Designer phone booths.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.790
Very cute.

05:15.830 --> 05:19.040
I bet you have a really neat
jukebox in here too.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.630
Over there?

05:21.380 --> 05:22.590
No.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.180
No.
This is the...

05:28.130 --> 05:32.260
...prototype of those.
The first one I had made.

05:32.890 --> 05:36.890
It works, but it's clunky.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.240
I call them telepods.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.990
They're controlled by this.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.620
Thank God for that.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.210
What do these
phones booths do?

06:01.420 --> 06:02.460
Telepods.

06:07.130 --> 06:10.470
Okay, I need an object.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.220
Do you have something that is...

06:15.890 --> 06:19.020
...personal I can use?
Something uniquely you?

06:19.770 --> 06:21.400
An item of clothing or jewelry?

06:22.400 --> 06:23.560
You kidding?

06:23.860 --> 06:25.190
No, I'm serious.

06:28.860 --> 06:31.610
Okay. Here it goes.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.430
I don't wear jewelry.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.390
It's nice.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.870
Brundle, Seth.

07:36.260 --> 07:37.680
Watch the stocking.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.420
Well?

08:09.800 --> 08:11.050
Great.

08:11.550 --> 08:15.510
A giant microwave oven. I'm glad
I didn't give you my Rolex.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.970
If I had a Rolex.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.350
You're missing the point.
Look.

08:27.310 --> 08:28.730
Teleportation?

08:30.570 --> 08:32.070
Please.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.540
Wait a minute.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.380
Is that a hologram?

08:52.920 --> 08:56.260
- Where's my stocking?
- That's it.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.430
Pick it up.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.320
I don't get it.

09:14.190 --> 09:15.320
What happened?

09:15.530 --> 09:18.070
You get it but you can't handle it.

09:19.450 --> 09:23.240
Your stocking has just
been teleported...

09:23.620 --> 09:26.960
...from one pod to another.

09:27.170 --> 09:30.040
Disintegrated there
and reintegrated there.

09:30.790 --> 09:31.880
Sort of.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.630
It will change the world
as we know it, right?

09:44.970 --> 09:46.520
This is incredible.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.520
It's not possible, is it?

09:48.980 --> 09:50.770
How have you kept this quiet?

09:51.650 --> 09:52.980
Please sit down.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.490
How could you do this alone?

09:56.150 --> 09:57.900
I don't work alone.

09:58.110 --> 10:00.620
There's stuff in there I don't
understand. I'm really a...

10:00.820 --> 10:02.530
...systems manager.
I farm out...

10:02.740 --> 10:05.870
...pieces to men more
brilliant than I. I say:

10:06.080 --> 10:10.960
"Design me a molecular analyzer,"
and they do. I just assemble it.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.920
None of them knows
what the project really is.

10:17.380 --> 10:20.890
And the money? Bartok
Science Industries financed this?

10:21.510 --> 10:24.390
But they leave me alone
because I'm not expensive.

10:24.810 --> 10:27.730
They know they'll own
whatever it is.

10:27.930 --> 10:29.480
You haven't told them?

10:29.850 --> 10:30.770
When I'm ready.

10:32.310 --> 10:33.820
Wait a second.

10:35.940 --> 10:36.900
What's that?

10:38.240 --> 10:39.700
To get the quotes right.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.410
Quotes? No.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.870
This was personal.
Don't write about it.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.660
What do you mean?
I'm a journalist.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.750
- Oh, no.
- You knew that.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.960
I made a mistake. I shouldn't
have shown you this. I'm very sorry.

10:57.170 --> 11:02.050
Partcle Magazne sent me
to get a story.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.640
This is the most
exciting story ever.

11:04.850 --> 11:07.390
No. Absolutely not.
I must have that tape.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.100
- Please.
- You can't do that.

11:09.350 --> 11:10.640
Don't write a story.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.770
I'd never have told
this stuff to a journalist.

11:12.980 --> 11:16.570
- But you told it to me.
- I suppose I did but...

11:16.980 --> 11:18.690
- Sure did.
- Now wait a minute.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.070
Come here.
What about your stocking?

11:22.490 --> 11:24.450
Keep it for good luck.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.090
I say: "Desgn me a
molecular analyzer, " and they do.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.380
I just assemblet.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.840
None of them knows
what the project reallys.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.510
And the money? Bartok
Scence Industres fnanced ths?

11:48.770 --> 11:51.770
But they leave me alone
because I'm not expensve.

11:52.690 --> 11:55.190
They know they'll own
whateverts.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.820
Well, that's it.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.490
What do you think?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.400
It's a joke.

12:03.610 --> 12:04.450
What?

12:04.660 --> 12:06.240
He's conning you.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.950
It's an old nightclub routine.
The two cabinets.

12:09.370 --> 12:12.460
- You fell for it.
- Wait a minute.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.500
- That was no...
- Are we having lunch?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.340
That was no nightclub routine.
I was there. I saw it.

12:24.340 --> 12:25.590
Sure.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.680
Send him in.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.310
You must have made an impression.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.730
What do you mean?

12:33.310 --> 12:35.940
Your magician followed you here.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.780
I'm Stathis Borans,
editor of Partcle Magazne.

12:41.990 --> 12:45.030
- Seth Brundle.
- I know who you are.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.780
Why don't you two use my office?
I've gotta run.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.370
If you plan to make anything
disappear, let me know.

12:53.620 --> 12:57.130
I have an assistant editor
who's outlived his usefulness.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.380
You didn't waste time.

13:04.260 --> 13:06.300
I'm not getting any younger.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.010
He wasn't impressed by your tape?

13:12.640 --> 13:14.180
He thinks you're a con man.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.350
Excellent.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.610
Let's see what the people
at Omnthink about it.

13:21.820 --> 13:24.110
No, no.
Listen, Veronica...

13:26.070 --> 13:28.620
I've come here to say one magic word.

13:29.950 --> 13:30.830
Yeah?

13:31.740 --> 13:32.830
Cheeseburger.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.500
I've been working alone too long.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.550
I have a strong urge
to talk about what I'm doing.

13:46.550 --> 13:49.340
But if this gets out now...

13:49.550 --> 13:51.550
...Veronica, it'll kill me.

13:52.220 --> 13:54.930
The Bartok people
and my colleagues will kill me.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.230
It's not ready yet.

13:57.480 --> 13:58.900
It works okay.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.480
No, something important's missing.

14:01.900 --> 14:02.900
Yeah?

14:04.190 --> 14:05.280
Yeah.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.280
What?

14:10.780 --> 14:13.700
I can only teleport inanimate objects.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.830
What happens when you
teleport living things?

14:20.580 --> 14:21.670
Not while we're eating.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.500
Can't be worse than this.

14:27.970 --> 14:30.640
You're not doing
a good job of convincing me.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.510
I think I should tell
the world about this now.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.810
You should tell it...

14:38.850 --> 14:41.350
...but not yet.
What do you have so far?

14:42.190 --> 14:43.690
Enough to make you nervous.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.400
Why not get more? Make me
your major project, a book.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.570
Not a magazine article.

14:49.780 --> 14:53.070
Follow me and my work,
day by day in detail.

14:53.740 --> 14:57.790
I have no life, so there's nothing
for you to interfere with.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.710
Research the background.
Cover the process.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.210
"The complete record of the most
earth-shattering invention ever.

15:06.460 --> 15:09.920
The one that ended
all concepts of transport...

15:10.130 --> 15:13.090
...of borders and frontiers,
of time and space."

15:15.720 --> 15:18.470
The book will end with me...

15:18.680 --> 15:22.150
...transporting myself
from one telepod to another.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.650
That's what's missing.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.280
Wait for me that long?

16:15.990 --> 16:17.990
What are you doing here?

16:18.410 --> 16:21.290
I was in the neighborhood.
Felt a bit scummy.

16:23.370 --> 16:24.830
Rough day.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.050
How'd you get in?

16:38.550 --> 16:40.520
I have a key, remember?

16:40.930 --> 16:42.100
You gave it to me.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.100
I should've changed the lock.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.480
You didn't.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.110
That's because unconsciously...

16:55.860 --> 16:59.160
...you still want me to come back,
move in again.

16:59.450 --> 17:00.580
No.

17:01.290 --> 17:05.790
That's because, consciously,
I'm lazy and disorganized.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.960
Your new playmate's interesting.

17:13.170 --> 17:14.550
What playmate?

17:14.920 --> 17:16.630
The nightclub act.

17:18.510 --> 17:19.760
Brundle.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:24.890 --> 17:28.440
I was wrong.
He's really quite brilliant.

17:30.110 --> 17:33.860
He led the F32 team.
Remember that?

17:35.110 --> 17:38.200
An inch away from the
Nobel Prize for physics.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.990
He was only 20 at the time.

17:41.620 --> 17:45.540
I'm not going to do Brundle.
Maybe the Psychology Today gig.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.330
That's not like you.

17:49.130 --> 17:51.380
Are you getting out or am I?

17:53.090 --> 17:56.720
I'll go. Shall I return later
and tuck you in?

17:57.340 --> 17:59.260
No. Key.

18:01.300 --> 18:02.890
I'll keep it...

18:03.890 --> 18:05.270
...for old time's sake.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.730
You're a petty schmuck.

18:30.830 --> 18:33.250
Initiate in 5 seconds.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.880
I've got to do this, Seth.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.050
Talk to the tape.
Get in the habit.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.170
The world will want to know
what you're thinking.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.340
"Fuck" is what I'm thinking!

20:02.840 --> 20:04.050
Good.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.760
The world will want to know that.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.390
What else?
Why didn't it work?

20:11.140 --> 20:14.400
I think it turned the baboon
inside out.

20:17.690 --> 20:18.780
Why?

20:20.190 --> 20:24.450
It can't deal with the flesh,
only inanimate objects.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.910
It must be my fault.

20:29.830 --> 20:30.790
Why?

20:33.370 --> 20:36.250
Computers only know
what you tell them.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.340
I don't know enough about the flesh.
I have to learn.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.220
I don't want to talk now.

21:07.620 --> 21:09.700
Do you ever change your clothes?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.580
What?

21:13.370 --> 21:16.370
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

21:19.710 --> 21:24.090
No, these are clean.
I change my clothes every day.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.810
Five sets of exactly the same clothes?

21:36.440 --> 21:37.520
Learned it from Einstein.

21:38.940 --> 21:40.520
This way I don't have to...

21:40.730 --> 21:45.110
...expend any thought on what to wear.
I grab the next set on the rack.

21:51.780 --> 21:55.620
I bought some steaks.
Can I make you one?

21:56.710 --> 21:57.870
We could go out.

21:59.130 --> 22:00.290
Cheeseburger?

22:03.670 --> 22:07.050
No, we don't have to go there.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.810
You're very cute. You know that?

22:19.730 --> 22:20.810
Am I?

23:00.900 --> 23:02.560
- What happened?
- On my back.

23:04.730 --> 23:07.150
Something's stuck to your back.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.280
Pull it off.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.040
Sorry.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.830
I wondered where this was.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.710
- Do you have any disinfectant?
- No, that's okay.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.630
I'll kiss it for you.

23:37.390 --> 23:41.140
Sorry.
I just want to eat you up.

23:42.770 --> 23:46.070
That's why old ladies
pinch babies' cheeks.

23:46.270 --> 23:49.780
It's the flesh. It makes you crazy.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.070
Ronnie. Ronnie.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.460
You want to try an experiment?

24:01.750 --> 24:02.750
Sure.

24:54.510 --> 24:57.720
Eat this.
I need an objective opinion.

25:06.850 --> 25:11.150
It could use some finesse,
but it tastes like a steak.

25:17.030 --> 25:19.990
Now try this teleported half.

25:20.240 --> 25:24.620
- A monkey just came apart in there.
- Baboon. Eat.

25:29.590 --> 25:30.880
It tastes funny.

25:31.210 --> 25:33.800
- Funny how?
- It tastes...

25:34.970 --> 25:35.930
...synthetic.

25:40.050 --> 25:41.430
What have we proved?

25:42.220 --> 25:47.350
The computer is giving us
its interpretation...

25:47.850 --> 25:51.690
...of a steak. It's translating it,
rethinking it...

25:51.900 --> 25:54.280
...rather than reproducing it.

25:54.490 --> 25:57.490
Something gets lost
in the translation.

25:58.530 --> 26:00.530
Me. I'm lost.

26:00.870 --> 26:02.740
The flesh.

26:02.950 --> 26:07.870
It should make the computer crazy.
Like old ladies pinching babies.

26:08.790 --> 26:10.130
But it doesn't yet.

26:10.340 --> 26:14.840
I haven't taught the computer
to be made crazy by the flesh.

26:15.050 --> 26:16.800
The poetry of the steak.

26:17.510 --> 26:19.680
So I'll teach it now.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.830
I knew it.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.540
What are you doing here?

27:32.380 --> 27:34.130
I followed you.

27:34.380 --> 27:38.920
Psychology Today, my ass. You
stayed with Brundle all night.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.550
Why didn't I believe you?

27:44.470 --> 27:47.270
I think he'd look great in this.
Don't you?

27:51.310 --> 27:55.020
For your Tme magazine cover,
you have to look good, right?

27:55.520 --> 27:58.400
Don't you get it?
I am finally onto something big.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.610
- Huge.
- Yeah? What? His cock?

28:02.660 --> 28:04.950
Crude, Stathis. Very crude.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.660
You're too perfect.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.330
You're a goddess.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.960
Thanks for making my
paranoid fantasies come true.

28:13.170 --> 28:15.380
I don't have to report to you,
you creep.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.630
Ronnie?
You have to talk to me.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.590
No, I don't! We're finished.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.590
I'll spend the night
anywhere I damn well please.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.010
Sorry. I'll take this too.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.880
I think it's time for champagne.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.770
Oh, God, Seth.

29:11.980 --> 29:14.060
It really happened. You did it!

29:14.270 --> 29:18.360
- You'll never be carsick again.
- Or airsick or seasick.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.940
I know. Or tricycle-sick.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.610
What's next?

29:27.200 --> 29:30.030
Send the baboon out for tests,
see if he's okay.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.330
How long will that take?

29:32.410 --> 29:33.410
Could be weeks.

29:34.290 --> 29:35.500
Really?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.330
Yeah, why?

29:39.290 --> 29:42.880
I was thinking that
we could take a holiday.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.840
We could?

29:45.220 --> 29:47.340
Yeah.
Like an old married couple.

29:47.550 --> 29:50.470
Old man's got
a couple weeks off, so...

29:50.680 --> 29:53.060
...they go to Florida, someplace warm.

29:53.930 --> 29:54.980
Just you and me?

29:55.770 --> 29:58.520
Is there someone else
you want to bring along?

29:58.730 --> 30:01.070
No, no, I just...

30:02.320 --> 30:04.490
Is this a romance we're having?

30:06.280 --> 30:08.620
Yeah. Could be a romance.

30:09.820 --> 30:10.990
Come here.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.580
I have a great idea.

30:24.010 --> 30:25.340
You like Chinese food?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.550
Yes.

30:29.430 --> 30:31.550
We'll have a romantic dinner here.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.060
What's this?

30:40.060 --> 30:42.570
From your editor.
It was under the door.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.490
Victor, it's Seth Brundle.

30:47.610 --> 30:48.660
Yeah, I'll wait.

30:52.620 --> 30:53.910
What's that?

30:57.830 --> 31:01.710
Nothing.
It's just personal bullshit.

31:02.710 --> 31:06.970
Old married couples share everything
to stay old and married.

31:08.050 --> 31:11.680
Listen, Seth, don't rush it.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.270
I have to go out for a few hours.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.230
No, Ronnie,
spicy eggplant, champagne.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.850
Just a few hours.

31:21.060 --> 31:22.980
I have the residue of another life.

31:23.190 --> 31:27.190
I have to scrape it off my shoe
and get rid of it, once and for all.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.890
What's this supposed to mean?

31:54.180 --> 31:57.350
I'm your editor and I'm shaping
your material into a story.

31:57.600 --> 32:01.230
You told me there was no story.
You said Brundle was a con man.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.940
I've decided to trust
your journalistic instincts.

32:05.150 --> 32:08.070
Thanks very much.
But this is not your story.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.780
It's mine.

32:10.030 --> 32:11.280
Says who?

32:11.530 --> 32:14.820
I sent you to the Bartok party
to see what you could find.

32:15.070 --> 32:17.080
Your discovery is my discovery.

32:17.870 --> 32:21.120
I have a lot of background on Brundle.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.330
He's worked on this for six years.

32:23.580 --> 32:26.340
There's material to find
if you dig deep.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.880
- I dug.
- Stathis...

32:29.130 --> 32:32.510
All transportation is going
to become obsolete.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.930
And I'm in the middle of it.

32:35.180 --> 32:38.640
- The only inside recorder of the event.
- Okay.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.690
Look, just keep me informed.
All right?

32:50.280 --> 32:51.570
As a friend?

32:52.610 --> 32:54.700
As a professional confidante?

32:56.740 --> 32:58.030
That's all?

33:01.160 --> 33:03.870
I don't want you
to disappear from my life.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.590
Okay.

33:15.010 --> 33:16.050
What about sex?

33:17.350 --> 33:20.810
I'm not saying love or affection.
Just stress-relieving sex.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.350
You and me.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.690
You're disgusting.

33:25.940 --> 33:27.360
As always.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.860
Couldn't disappoint you.

33:34.490 --> 33:37.030
Residue means your old boyfriend,
doesn't it?

33:39.200 --> 33:41.620
Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend.

33:42.830 --> 33:45.370
"From the desk of Stathis Borans."

33:46.210 --> 33:48.670
How about, "Under the desk
of Stathis Borans"?

33:49.590 --> 33:53.420
She works for her old boyfriend
and runs out late at night to see him.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.220
Is this the Ronnie game?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.060
I'm catching on. I'm catching on.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.350
I didn't mean to kill your brother,
but he didn't die in vain...

34:08.610 --> 34:10.400
...if that's any comfort.

34:11.820 --> 34:15.360
I wouldn't ask you to do anything
that I wouldn't do myself.

34:19.030 --> 34:20.159
You're all right.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.040
I can tell you're okay.

34:27.170 --> 34:29.580
What are we waiting for? Let's do it.

36:07.850 --> 36:09.480
How you doing?

36:10.180 --> 36:11.980
Now, you tell me.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.480
Am I different somehow?

36:15.190 --> 36:17.400
"Is it live or is it Memorex?"

36:19.780 --> 36:21.990
It's too bad Ronnie missed it.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.760
I missed you last night.

37:25.220 --> 37:28.100
It's still night. I came back.

37:29.140 --> 37:32.480
You had to celebrate without me.
I'm sorry.

37:33.270 --> 37:35.190
I went through last night.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.520
You went through?

37:38.980 --> 37:41.230
Without testing the baboon?

37:42.900 --> 37:46.660
I was drunk. I was a bit upset.

37:47.570 --> 37:49.410
You could've killed yourself.

37:58.670 --> 38:00.420
Are you sleeping with Stathis?

38:01.380 --> 38:02.840
What are you talking about?

38:03.380 --> 38:06.680
I don't know.
I just get that feeling.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.350
That's why you were upset?

38:15.230 --> 38:16.890
I got jealous.

38:17.480 --> 38:22.320
Oh, God. Seth, you don't
have to be jealous.

38:23.230 --> 38:25.240
He's an old boyfriend.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.740
He taught college.
I was a science major.

38:29.070 --> 38:31.280
He got me started in journalism.

38:32.290 --> 38:33.370
Does he love you?

38:34.910 --> 38:36.710
How could he not?

38:42.550 --> 38:45.050
You went through and I wasn't there.

38:46.510 --> 38:47.930
I taped it for you.

38:49.470 --> 38:50.680
You did?

43:56.480 --> 43:59.990
I asked the computer if it improved
me, but it didn't understand.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.490
That made me think about what
I'm feeling and why. I'm thinking...

44:04.740 --> 44:09.330
...that process of being taken apart
atom by atom and reassembled...

44:09.540 --> 44:14.130
It's like filtering coffee. It's a
purifying process. It's cleansed me.

44:14.380 --> 44:17.670
I think it's going to allow me
to realize...

44:18.510 --> 44:22.430
...the personal potential I've been
neglecting all these years...

44:22.680 --> 44:26.010
...that I've been obsessively pursuing
goal after goal.

44:26.680 --> 44:29.350
Do you take coffee with your sugar?

44:31.390 --> 44:34.690
I've never given me
a chance to be me.

44:35.270 --> 44:37.730
Interestingly, when I achieved...

44:37.980 --> 44:40.530
...what will prove to be my
life's work...

44:40.780 --> 44:43.110
...I've become the real me, finally.

44:43.320 --> 44:45.120
So, listen...

44:45.370 --> 44:47.120
...not to wax Messianic...

44:47.370 --> 44:52.210
...but the synchronicity of the two
events may blur the individual effect.

44:52.460 --> 44:55.920
But it is, nevertheless, also
certainly true.

44:56.170 --> 45:00.010
I will say now, however
subjectively, human teleportation...

45:00.210 --> 45:03.760
...molecular breakdown and reformation
is inherently purging.

45:04.010 --> 45:05.970
It makes a man a king.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.930
Since I left the pod, I feel great.

45:08.180 --> 45:11.270
I think I will have a cannoli
after all. Waiter!

45:11.480 --> 45:14.600
What an accomplishment.
But what have I really done?

45:14.850 --> 45:16.730
I've said to the world:

45:16.980 --> 45:20.230
"Let's go. Move.
Catch me if you can." Waiter.

45:20.490 --> 45:22.240
Jesus Christ!

45:38.540 --> 45:40.050
Oh, God.

45:42.420 --> 45:43.800
What?

45:44.510 --> 45:46.720
How can you keep going?

45:48.390 --> 45:51.560
You can't have any fluid left
in your body.

45:51.810 --> 45:53.640
We've been doing this for hours.

45:53.890 --> 45:55.900
I'm not ready to quit yet.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.650
Come on.

46:05.110 --> 46:07.030
Hey. What's this?

46:07.570 --> 46:09.280
It's an attempt to distract me.

46:10.160 --> 46:12.290
Really, what is it? It's like...

46:13.620 --> 46:16.960
...hairs or something.
- I don't know, it's...

46:17.210 --> 46:19.790
It happens when you get older,
weird hair.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.960
They're really coarse.

46:23.460 --> 46:27.840
I've never been hairy enough.
Know what I mean? Always too boyish.

46:28.090 --> 46:30.100
I look forward to a hairy body.

46:30.680 --> 46:34.060
It's one of the compensations
of old age. Where are you going?

47:06.470 --> 47:08.840
Not my new hairs. What are you doing?

47:09.050 --> 47:10.090
Relax.

47:11.430 --> 47:14.060
You don't want a body
covered with these.

47:14.810 --> 47:17.640
God! They're really tough!

47:20.400 --> 47:21.610
Listen.

47:22.690 --> 47:26.030
I want you to go through.
I want to teleport you right now.

47:26.280 --> 47:29.570
I hardly need to sleep
and I feel wonderful.

47:29.820 --> 47:31.820
It's like a pure, benign drug.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.330
The power I feel surging inside me...!

47:34.540 --> 47:37.500
We'll be the perfect couple.
The dynamic duo. Come on.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.170
- Right now.
- Hey, wait.

47:39.420 --> 47:42.790
Don't give me that born-again
teleportation. I'm scared.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.630
What do I have to say?
I'm not gonna do it!

47:47.050 --> 47:49.010
You're a fucking drag, you know?

47:52.300 --> 47:56.390
Something went wrong. When you
went through, something went wrong.

48:02.900 --> 48:04.770
No? Not you?

48:04.980 --> 48:08.610
If you're too chickenshit to be
in the dynamic duo club...

48:08.860 --> 48:11.700
...I'll find somebody else
who can keep up with me.

48:11.950 --> 48:13.450
Listen to me...

48:13.700 --> 48:16.160
You're afraid to dive
in the plasma pool.

48:16.410 --> 48:19.000
You're afraid to be destroyed
and re-created.

48:19.250 --> 48:21.290
Think you woke me up about the flesh?

48:21.540 --> 48:24.790
You only know society's
straight line about the flesh.

48:25.040 --> 48:29.800
You can't penetrate society's
sick gray fear of the flesh.

48:30.220 --> 48:34.800
Drink deep, or taste not the plasma
spring. See what I'm saying?

48:35.010 --> 48:38.140
This is not just sex and penetration,
but penetration...

48:38.350 --> 48:40.440
...beyond the veil of the flesh.

48:40.640 --> 48:44.270
A deep, penetrating dive
into the plasma pool.

49:27.150 --> 49:28.820
I'll have a scotch.

49:31.610 --> 49:32.990
Who's winning?

49:35.030 --> 49:36.320
I don't know.

49:37.530 --> 49:39.040
I hope it's Marky.

49:41.410 --> 49:43.540
- How come?
- Because.

49:44.210 --> 49:45.580
I like Marky tonight.

49:46.830 --> 49:47.880
I like you tonight.

49:49.340 --> 49:51.340
Maybe I'd better get involved.

49:54.760 --> 49:57.430
Hey, pal, you're disturbing us.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.760
$100 says I can beat either of you.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.100
Take a hike, asshole.

50:08.940 --> 50:10.530
Here's my hundred.

50:11.690 --> 50:13.820
I get to take her home if I win.

50:14.150 --> 50:15.740
Says who?

50:16.240 --> 50:17.450
Do I look like a hooker?

50:18.280 --> 50:21.580
Tawny, it's an easy hundred.
Let's get it over with.

50:25.620 --> 50:29.290
- Watch out. He eats chocolate bars.
- So I noticed.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.090
Are you a bodybuilder?

51:20.350 --> 51:24.600
I build bodies. I take them apart
and put them back together.

51:24.850 --> 51:26.980
Well, you sure took Marky apart.

51:27.230 --> 51:30.230
- Let's go to my place.
- Your place?

51:30.480 --> 51:33.730
Well, okay.
I live with my mother anyway.

51:33.940 --> 51:37.530
But could we go
to a few more bars first?

51:37.780 --> 51:40.700
- It's too early to quit.
- Sure, a few more bars.

52:06.310 --> 52:08.350
Great place.

52:16.940 --> 52:18.570
There's no elevator.

52:19.450 --> 52:21.910
- I can't make it.
- There's an elevator.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.120
There, don't you feel elevated?

53:18.460 --> 53:19.960
Are you a magician?

53:24.970 --> 53:26.350
Yes.

53:53.960 --> 53:57.000
So, are we going to breakfast or not?

53:59.590 --> 54:01.170
It's your turn.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.880
- To do what?
- To go through.

54:04.090 --> 54:06.260
No. I don't want to try that.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.260
It'll make you feel sexy.

54:08.510 --> 54:10.770
I already feel sexy.

54:12.140 --> 54:13.890
How about...

54:14.600 --> 54:16.400
...a nice...

54:16.850 --> 54:20.150
...alcohol rub?
- Don't do that! It hurts.

54:22.070 --> 54:24.110
Sorry, hon.

54:24.650 --> 54:27.450
I didn't know you had
the skin of a princess.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.870
- You're sensitive.
- Okay!

54:30.120 --> 54:32.290
That's it. You're going to like it.

54:32.540 --> 54:35.160
- I don't want to. I'm afraid.
- Don't be afraid.

54:35.420 --> 54:36.460
No.

54:37.210 --> 54:40.170
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.460
Who's this?

54:43.340 --> 54:45.430
Oh, I live with my mother too.

54:46.090 --> 54:47.390
Mom, meet Tawny.

54:49.350 --> 54:50.810
I gotta go.

54:56.850 --> 54:58.730
Thanks for a wonderful time.

55:07.570 --> 55:10.700
Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?

55:13.080 --> 55:14.290
You're changing.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.500
Everything about you is changing.

55:17.750 --> 55:19.580
You look bad.

55:20.210 --> 55:21.250
You smell bad.

55:22.300 --> 55:23.840
I've never bathed much.

55:26.340 --> 55:31.260
Those weird hairs that grew out
of your back, I took them to a lab.

55:31.470 --> 55:33.350
I had them analyzed.

55:36.640 --> 55:38.350
The hairs?

55:39.600 --> 55:41.480
The hairs?

55:41.900 --> 55:45.030
Oh, yeah.
That's a strange thing to do.

55:45.230 --> 55:47.530
Not as strange as the results.

55:47.990 --> 55:50.660
The guy had trouble identifying them.

55:51.320 --> 55:55.120
He finally concluded that they
were definitely not human.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.250
- Very good.
- Not human, Seth.

56:00.540 --> 56:04.590
In fact, very likely insect hairs.

56:05.250 --> 56:06.760
That's ridiculous.

56:07.010 --> 56:08.220
Look.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.010
There's more. Look at your face.

56:12.100 --> 56:13.850
Something happened.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.720
You need help. You must be sick.

56:16.930 --> 56:18.600
You're jealous!

56:21.560 --> 56:24.320
I've become free
and you can't stand it.

56:24.570 --> 56:26.730
You'll do anything to bring me down.

56:28.610 --> 56:31.280
Does this look like a sick man to you?

56:33.370 --> 56:34.870
No, stop it!

56:35.120 --> 56:36.740
Can a sick man do that?

56:37.580 --> 56:40.290
The deal is off.
I don't need you anymore.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.000
Seth, please, wait. Seth!

56:44.250 --> 56:45.380
Don't come back.

56:46.550 --> 56:48.210
Oh, God...

59:01.350 --> 59:02.720
Oh, no.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.100
What's happening to me? Am I dying?

59:09.480 --> 59:11.690
Is this how it starts? Am I dying?

59:15.240 --> 59:16.900
Brundle, Seth.

59:18.110 --> 59:19.820
Give me a disc.

59:20.740 --> 59:23.370
I need the first
teleportation: S. Brundle.

59:59.450 --> 01:00:00.870
Run sequence.

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.520
Hello.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.530
Seth.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.780
Seth, I've been trying to reach you.
Where are you?

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.910
I've been afrad to see you.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.750
Now I'm afrad not to.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.380
Are you at home?

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.630
You don't know how rght you were.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.500
I've gotten...

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.550
...much, much worse.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.130
Please come see me.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:27.220
Please come now.

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:53.330
Seth?

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.000
I'm here.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.420
Stop!

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:05.010
You were right.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.300
I'm diseased...

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.600
...and it might be contagious somehow.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.180
I wouldn't want to infect you.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.730
And it's been accelerating.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:22.940
It's unrelenting.
Every day there are changes.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:26.650
Every time I look in the mirror,
I'm someone different, repulsive.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.860
What happened?

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.080
I know an old lady who swallowed a fly
Perhaps she'll de

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.620
Seth, please.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:40.880
I was not pure. The teleporter
insists on purity. I was not pure.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.550
I don't know what you mean.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.220
A fly...

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.850
...got into the transmitter pod with
me that first time when I was alone.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.060
The computer got confused.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.570
There weren't supposed
to be two genetic patterns.

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:08.200
And it decided to splice us together.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.700
It mated us, me and the fly.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:12.990
We hadn't been properly introduced.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:20.880
My teleporter turned
into a gene splicer.

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:25.050
A very good one.
I'm not Seth Brundle anymore.

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:29.800
I'm the offspring
of Brundle and a housefly.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.890
Oh, God. Oh, God, Seth!

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.980
You look so pretty.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.270
What will happen?

01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:43.020
I think it's showing itself
as a bizarre form of cancer.

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:48.440
General cellular chaos and revolution.
I'm just gonna disintegrate.

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.740
In a novel way, no doubt.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:52.700
Then I'll die.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.200
- And then it will be over.
- No, I don't accept that.

01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:01.170
There must be something we can do,
someone to go to, tests to be done.

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:05.960
No! I won't be
just another tumorous bore...

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:10.340
...talking about his hair falling out
and his lost lymph nodes.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.680
What do you want me to do?
Why did you call me?

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:32.360
That's disgusting.

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:43.880
My...

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.500
...ear. No!

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.550
I'm scared.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.140
Help me.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.720
Please, please, help me.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.530
- Don't go back to him.
- That's it?

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.820
That's your advice?

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:15.160
It could be contagious.
It could become an epidemic.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.120
I have to go back to him.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:21.200
- I don't believe this.
- Lf you saw him, Stathis...

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:25.000
If you saw how scared and angry
and desperate he is...

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.130
I'm sure Typhoid Mary was nice
when you saw her socially.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.460
- I do not want...
- I don't care!

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.670
All right, fine, okay.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.940
Do I have permission to claim
your body when this is over?

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.820
Oh, God...

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.490
Look, how about this?

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.290
You say, if only I saw him.

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:04.210
Show me.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.460
Tape him. Show me.

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.000
Let me think about it.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.760
I'll come up with something.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:41.280
Seth?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Seth?

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:51.290
No, no, no. Up here.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.800
I've gotten pretty good at it.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.680
Yeah, it's almost second nature.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.970
I stopped biting my nails.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.150
Look at this. What's this?

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.480
I don't know.

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:19.859
I seem to be stricken by a disease
with a purpose, wouldn't you say?

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:28.000
Maybe not such a bad disease
after all.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.710
I can't stay.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.330
No, no, no.

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.670
Why not? Why can't you?

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:36.840
I can't take it. It's too much.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:39.630
Why? The disease
has revealed its purpose.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.260
We don't have to worry about
contagion. I know what it wants.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.100
What does it want?

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.729
It wants to turn me
into something else.

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.270
Most people would give anything
to be something else.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.939
Turned into what?

01:08:56.149 --> 01:09:00.319
What do you think, a fly?
Am I becoming a 185-pound fly?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.779
No, I'm becoming something
that never existed.

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:06.490
I'm becoming "Brundlefly."

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:09.750
That's worth a Nobel Prize.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.790
Here.

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:16.630
I want to give a demonstration...

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.930
...that I think you'll want
to record for posterity.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.800
I think you must chronicle...

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:28.060
...the life and times of Brundlefly,
don't you?

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.850
At the very least, it should make
a fabulous children's book.

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:34.560
You seem tired.

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:37.779
You got me there?

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.740
How does Brundlefly eat?

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.910
He found out the hard way
that he eats like a fly eats.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.870
His teeth are now useless.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.540
Although he can chew up
solid food, he can't digest it.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:58.170
Solid food hurts. So, like a fly...

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:02.880
...Brundlefly breaks down solds
wth a corrosve enzyme...

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.390
...playfully called "vomt drop."

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.560
He regurgtates on hs food.
It lquefes.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:11.230
And then he suckst back up.

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:13.980
Ready for a demonstraton, kds?

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.230
Heret goes.

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.820
Oh, my God.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.900
My God!

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.910
Hey, Ronnie.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:36.710
Ronnie!

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.680
What is it?

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.020
I'm pregnant.

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.980
Oh, no.

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:02.530
Oh, no.

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:07.320
I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.540
What do you want to do?

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:21.920
I don't know.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.550
I just...

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.220
I don't know.

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:59.670
- Stathis, I'm scared.
- It's going to be all right, Ronnie.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:01.960
It's going to be fine.

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.340
I don't think I want to lose it.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:08.890
- Why am I losing it?
- It's better this way. You'll see.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.180
It's the best thing that could happen.

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:17.690
She's expelling it. It's coming out.
I don't think we'll have to go in.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:20.940
It's gonna be easy.
Don't worry, honey.

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:24.940
No. Please, no.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.200
It'll be over soon. Here we go.

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.740
A little suction here.
A little suction.

01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:39.830
Hold on a minute.
There's more in there.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.960
- There's more?
- Yeah, I mean a lot more. Okay.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.920
You're gonna have to help us.
Push.

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.720
Push it out. Come on, push.

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:53.100
- That's it. Come on, push.
- No, wait.

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:56.220
Give us a push. You can push it out.
Come on.

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:58.640
No, wait, wait. No.

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:00.140
You can do it.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.900
Wait.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.150
No!

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.520
I want a disc.
Give me preliminary integration.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.940
I want a dsc.
Gve me prelmnaryntegraton.

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:10.730
You're relics. Yes, you are.
You can't deny it.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.910
Vestigial, archaeological, redundant.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.540
Artifacts of a bygone era.

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:24.250
Of historical interest only.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.440
You've missed some good moments.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.980
Is that why you're here? To catch up?

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.450
I wanted...

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.870
My teeth have begun to fall out.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.670
The medicine cabinet's now
the Brundle Museum of Natural History.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.050
Want to see it?

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.420
No.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.930
Then...

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:23.310
...what do you want?

01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:29.100
I came to tell you...

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:36.610
I just...

01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:41.120
I wanted to see you...

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.870
...before...

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:53.540
You have to leave now...

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.920
...and never come back here.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.600
Have you heard of insect politics?

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.190
Neither have I.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:16.860
Insects don't have politics.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.820
They're very brutal.

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.780
No compassion.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.040
No compromise.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.580
We can't trust the insect.

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:34.170
I'd like to become...

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.340
...the first insect politician.

01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:41.510
I'd like to...

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.680
...but I'm afraid...

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:49.310
I don't know
what you're trying to say.

01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:52.100
I'm saying...

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.740
I'm saying I'm an insect...

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:07.830
...who dreamt he was a man
and loved it.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.250
But now the dream is over...

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.330
...and the insect is awake.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.460
No, Seth.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.010
I'm saying...

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.010
...I'll hurt you if you stay.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.430
Let's go. Let's do it now.

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:08.640
Now? Wait.
Wait a minute. What did he say?

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.980
I couldn't tell him.
Let's go, damn it.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.810
No! I think we should
wait a few days.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.650
You're not
in the right state of mind.

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:20.190
I want it out of my body now.
You should have seen him.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.860
There could be anything in here,
in me, in my body.

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:26.160
I don't know if I can
arrange it now, tonight.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.620
Why do we have to...?

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.950
I don't want it. Understand?
I don't want it in my body!

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.780
Well, okay, what's the story?

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.790
She's pregnant
and she wants an abortion.

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:16.750
In the middle of the night?

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.210
We have good reason to think that...

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.960
...this child will be deformed.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:28.340
- Yeah, but in the middle of the night?
- Look, Brent.

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.510
Please.

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:34.890
Is it your child?

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:36.850
No.

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:44.570
It's the child of a man
who is deformed.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.780
I don't mean to interfere...

01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:51.870
...but I detect a certain
uncertainty here.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.990
There are tests we can do
to determine whether...

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.420
I don't want tests.
Tests can't guarantee anything.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:02.960
The baby could start off normal,
then become...

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:07.550
I want an abortion.

01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:12.760
I'll do it myself if I have to.

01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:17.730
If you'll slip into that,
we'll be on our way in no time.

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:45.670
No.

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:51.300
Wait, Seth, no.

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:19.250
Why did you want to kill Brundle?

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:25.500
The baby might be all that's left
of the real me.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.710
Please don't kill me.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.680
I can't have it. I'm afraid.

01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:38.680
Please, have the baby.

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:40.480
I can't.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.850
I can't.

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:46.360
Too bad.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.820
Too bad.

01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:16.090
Jesus!

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:28.290
No, don't. Don't, please.

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.910
Please.

01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:54.100
Help me.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.980
Help me be human.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.110
How?

01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:08.330
Well...

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.330
I go there...

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.340
...and you go there.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.550
We come apart...

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:29.510
...and then we come together there.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.940
You, me and the baby.

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:37.270
Together.

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.710
No...

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.000
We'll be the ultimate family.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:03.880
A family of three,
joined together in one body.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.300
More human than I am alone.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.060
No, no!

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.370
Oh, God. Please!

01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:50.720
Oh, God, please!

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:29.480
No, I can't.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.980
I can't.
