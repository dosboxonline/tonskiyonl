WEBVTT

00:15.516 --> 00:16.683
- Hey.
- Hey, Jim.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.823
Linking to S-band four.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.117
We have signal lock.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.538
Okay. We're back in.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.457
Ready to send encrypted test ping
to Ranger.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.376
Hey, make sure
he's got the right encryption.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.836
Better work this time.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.380
I feel good about this one.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.090
That's what you said the last 20 times.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.174
Nineteen.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.886
Transceiver connected.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.138
Safety bypassed.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.223
Ping.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.475
Transmitting ping to Ranger.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.272
No joy. Their discriminator just
kicked us out again.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.984
Sam's been on Ranger for a month.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.027
She should have replaced it
with ours already.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.155
If she doesn't get that discriminator
up and running in the next 48 hours--

01:12.155 --> 01:13.699
Goldilocks burns for Earth.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.909
And there's nothing we can do to stop it.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.998
Ranger, Happy Valley.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.208
<i>Transmitting
simulated burn termination command.</i>

01:24.376 --> 01:26.253
<i>Please confirm acquisition
and authentication.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:29.631
Happy Valley,

01:29.631 --> 01:32.885
Ranger has just received
your simulated engine shutdown command.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.930
Main engine cutoff verified
at 19 minutes 58 seconds.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.558
<i>And we show good engine shutdown.</i>

01:39.558 --> 01:42.186
Neatly done, Ranger. That was beautiful.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.397
It was simply a matter
of superior cunning and skill, Commander.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.733
<i>We'll run that drill again in seven hours.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:51.612
<i>Gotta keep these procedures fresh.
We won't get a second bite at that apple.</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:54.656
Roger, Happy Valley. Be back with you
in seven hours. Ranger out.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.866
<i>Out.</i>

01:57.868 --> 02:01.163
Okay, people. Let's continue
our simulated shutdown procedure.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.040
Verified discriminator active?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.626
Discriminator shows active.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.294
Okay.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.631
Reduce fusion reactor one through four
output temps to standby.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.762
Fusion reactors
one through four are in standby mode.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.388
Very well.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.100
Rozhenkova, simulate reactor
thermal power reduction to 50%

02:22.100 --> 02:23.769
on reactors one through four.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.899
Power reduction to 50%
simulated on reactors one through four.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.526
Mr. James,

02:30.526 --> 02:33.779
please report the condition of
our mechanical connection to the asteroid.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.699
Anchor stress nominal in all respects.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.870
Sensor self-check shows no failures.
Green board.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.955
Very well.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.165
Main propulsion systems are nominal.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.793
All temps and pressures in the green.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.545
Okay.

02:49.545 --> 02:53.382
Let's run a simulated off-scale
high pressure reading on argon tank two.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.512
Primary and secondary.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.931
Confirm.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.810
Monitoring the simulated
off-scale high pressure

03:04.810 --> 03:07.688
indicating both primary and secondary.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.473
Christ. Thing's cooked.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.434
We're not gonna
get any NASA control signals through this.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.688
We certainly don't have the time
to fix it. Next drill's in three hours.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.315
Log it. Put in the spare.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.110
I know where it is. I'll get it.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.404
Thank you, Massey.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.227
These are the methane concentrations our
robots detected during our lava tube test

05:52.227 --> 05:54.313
just outside of Happy Valley.

05:54.313 --> 05:57.274
And this is the data they sent over
this morning from Korolev Crater.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.861
Of course,
these are just preliminary results but...

06:03.989 --> 06:04.990
Dev.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.034
Sorry.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.411
That's Korolev Crater?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.497
The heaviest concentrations are there, yes.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.333
But there are also substantial signatures

06:14.333 --> 06:16.627
coming from Chasma Australe
near the south pole.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.837
Both of which are far
from known volcanic regions.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.756
Any data yet
on what's producing the methane?

06:20.756 --> 06:23.425
Could be deep subsurface
volcanic activity.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.303
Or better yet, the Holy Grail.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.764
Methanogenic bacteria?

06:29.348 --> 06:30.349
Life.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.727
Looks like you got
your work cut out for you.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.397
All right. Stick with it, Kelly.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.984
If Martian life is out there,
I want it to be you who finds it.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.238
You're leaving?
I have a lot more data to show you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.783
I'll be right back. I got a couple things
I gotta take care of.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.118
With my dad?

06:54.540 --> 06:55.541
Why do you ask?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.962
You two seem to be spending a lot of time
together lately.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.423
Which is surprising honestly,
considering your history.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.675
Yeah, he's--

07:06.343 --> 07:09.221
His experience up here is
incredibly valuable

07:09.221 --> 07:11.056
with the asteroid capture mission
coming up.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.811
He didn't mention he was working on that.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.690
But then again,
I haven't seen him in a few days, so...

07:19.690 --> 07:21.608
Yeah, it's been very time-consuming.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.902
But he's thrilled to have you.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.530
You know, he can't stop talking
about the little guy.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.615
Yeah, I'm--

07:29.491 --> 07:30.868
I'm glad they're getting closer.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.581
I just... I don't know.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.500
I thought we'd be closer too.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.795
I know it sounds stupid
considering everything that's--

07:41.795 --> 07:43.130
Not at all.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.175
I understand. Believe me.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.888
I didn't have the chance
to make things right with my dad.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.141
At least you still do.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.065
Anyway, I should get going.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.818
Hey. Great work, Kelly.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.042
You want our eyes?

08:22.169 --> 08:25.297
We need to see the whole base to make
sure no one's on to what we're doing.

08:27.090 --> 08:30.135
Dangerous. It's very dangerous.

08:30.719 --> 08:34.347
Well, so was staying alone on
a North Korean capsule for seven months.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.352
That was not choice. This is a choice.

08:52.783 --> 08:53.867
My wife.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.537
What is your status?

08:56.537 --> 08:57.621
Lee, it's complicated.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.541
Tell me. She is not safe.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.002
Well, like I said before,
things are in motion.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.922
We've got a good plan now
to get her out of North Korea,

09:06.922 --> 09:10.634
but sneaking her
onto a Helios transport launch,

09:10.634 --> 09:12.803
well, that's even more complicated.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.430
Lee, don't you see what we're doing here?

09:15.430 --> 09:21.603
This asteroid is gonna secure the future
for Mars, for you and your wife.

09:26.108 --> 09:29.194
It is good to have family with you.

09:29.820 --> 09:30.988
As you do.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.660
Okay.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.954
I help.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.375
Good to have you on board...

09:45.419 --> 09:48.797
All right. I'm getting video
and audio feeds from PRK.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.260
And now we've got Ops-Com.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.431
I never thought I'd say this,
but God bless North Korea.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.224
<i>You ready for status update?</i>

09:59.224 --> 10:01.602
<i>Ready for uplink whenever you're ready.</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:05.689
<i>Happy Valley, confirming
we have the backup discriminator installed</i>

10:05.689 --> 10:08.609
<i>and will be up and running
for the next simulation.</i>

10:08.609 --> 10:09.776
Do you hear that?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.738
It appears Samantha Massey may
have just vindicated your faith in her.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.740
Copy, Ranger. Thanks for the update.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.743
But let us make sure. I'll test it again.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.412
<i>EECOM, start preparing
the next burn simulation</i>

10:20.412 --> 10:22.164
for transmission to Ranger.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.373
Send another ping.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.631
- We're in.
- Yes.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.341
- Come on. Yes.
- Ranger authenticated our ping.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.134
All right. Good job, everybody.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.845
Our discriminator's in
and we control their engines.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.223
Here we go.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.479
And after doing multiple
risk assessments over this past month,

10:45.479 --> 10:48.941
we don't feel we can
expedite the mining schedule any further.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.110
I've gotta say,
the president is gonna be disappointed

10:52.110 --> 10:54.655
with this projected
two-year delivery timeline.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.325
There's gotta be a way
to get the iridium to market more quickly.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.538
We could build more ships,
with drills, dirt movers.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.540
That will, however, drive up costs.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.916
Oh, Christ, no.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.293
We're already looking
at a trillion dollars.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.797
If I tell him it's gonna cost even more,
he might just fire us all.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.466
Well, I appreciate the ideas.

11:14.967 --> 11:18.470
Keep spitballing and let's see
if we can get something that sticks.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.181
Right. Eli, when can we expect
funding approval to clear

11:21.181 --> 11:23.183
for the next generation
of Mars transports?

11:25.811 --> 11:27.145
Let me get back to you on that.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.773
But we're bumping up
against source deadlines.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.531
Just imagine what we could accomplish

11:37.531 --> 11:39.825
if these fucking politicians got
out of our way.

11:39.825 --> 11:44.371
Their great skill is putting off decisions
until absolutely necessary.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.297
Could I get you to weigh in
on these trajectory calculations?

12:07.311 --> 12:09.479
I need you to get this to Sergei.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.399
I want a fresh pair of eyes
on these dispersal trajectories.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.067
We need to be completely certain that

12:14.067 --> 12:19.072
we've accounted for the worst possible
case before we pitch the powers that be.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.365
No, I'm done with that.

12:21.033 --> 12:24.661
I've been passing these notes
between you guys for the past month.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
We don't have time
for all this back-and-forth.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.123
But we need his help.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.920
He understands translunar trajectories
better than anyone.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.343
Okay. But we have to do this face-to-face.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.639
Where? They're watching me 24-7.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.350
We can meet at my house.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.061
We'll tell them
we're working on this there.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.062
That's risky.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.316
What part of this isn't?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.385
- What's wrong with the screen?
- What?

13:22.219 --> 13:25.138
There's never been
static like this before.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.059
Perhaps it's because it's an old monitor.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.521
What is going on?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.607
The surveillance monitors are malfunctioning.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.618
Of course it is malfunctioning.
This is a mess!

13:46.618 --> 13:49.580
Sir, let us resolve the issue,
you should not have to--

13:49.580 --> 13:50.664
Hold on...

13:57.421 --> 13:58.463
What is this?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.720
I do not know.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.854
This American espionage equipment
was found on

14:13.854 --> 14:16.064
sovereign soil of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

14:16.064 --> 14:18.066
We demand an explanation
for this outrageous behavior!

14:18.066 --> 14:20.652
I take it
you found this thing in your complex?

14:21.153 --> 14:23.739
This cause static on screen.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.574
What screen?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.910
She wants to know which screen.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.665
I see.

14:33.665 --> 14:38.837
So, you found this hooked up to the system
you use to spy on us.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.258
Tell her the Democratic People's Republic

14:43.258 --> 14:45.802
demands whoever did this to be punished!

14:45.802 --> 14:48.639
Commander Cho demand you investigate.

14:48.639 --> 14:49.973
I'm happy to help,

14:49.973 --> 14:52.643
but it would mean that
we need to come into your complex

14:52.643 --> 14:54.686
to see where the device was discovered.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.858
She wants to send her people
into the module to search it.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.029
No! We will countenance no intrusions
into our territory.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.906
If the People's Republic of Korea
is intruded upon,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.616
there will be devastating consequences.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.785
I don't have time
for this right now. All right?

15:09.785 --> 15:12.162
Can't this wait
until after the asteroid mission?

15:12.913 --> 15:16.583
The commander apologizes
for your inconvenience.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.547
In the meantime, I can track this down.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.341
It's got a NASA serial number.
That's the best I can do.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.177
She says
she will convey your demands to NASA.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.554
She's stalling.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.681
Tell her
to immediately arrest and question

15:30.681 --> 15:34.893
Helios technician Miles Dale. He's the
only one who has been in our module.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.145
- Commander wishes to express his--
- Miles Dale?

15:39.565 --> 15:41.692
- Ms. Talmadge?
- Yes, Commander?

15:41.692 --> 15:43.610
I have a part I need you to track down.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.863
See where it came from, who had access. Immediately.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.155
Aye, aye, Commander.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.326
She is a useless tool
of the decadent capitalist system.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.328
I will investigate this incident myself.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.546
- Thank you.
- Hey, Lee.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.591
How you doing otherwise? How's Moon Yeong?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.637
It is difficult being parted.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.183
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.353
But we will be back Earthside
before you know it.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.534
You know, Zay,
out of everything I've done in my life,

16:33.285 --> 16:35.913
you are my proudest achievement.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.875
To see you grow up to be a fine young man,

16:40.918 --> 16:43.212
and now gone on
to have a family of your own.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.296
I just--

16:44.922 --> 16:49.384
Well, that means more to me
than any mission patch.

16:50.802 --> 16:54.806
And I intend to be the best goddamn
grandma on the planet.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.647
So what, we got three months
until the big day, huh?

17:03.315 --> 17:07.109
Yeah. Goldilocks should be
well on her way to Earth by then.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.196
And so will I.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.541
One of my regrets...

17:23.877 --> 17:26.588
is that I never got to see you
take your first steps

17:27.506 --> 17:29.049
or say your first words.

17:30.676 --> 17:34.263
And now I'll get to do that
with your daughter.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.772
Sorry, that...

17:44.940 --> 17:46.191
That took me by surprise.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.946
I'm just so happy.

17:56.827 --> 17:57.828
Anyway...

18:01.164 --> 18:04.877
I know you hate Star Trek
but you better get used to it

18:04.877 --> 18:09.965
because I'm gonna make sure that
my grandbaby is a full-blown Trekkie.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.886
That's right. We're gonna watch
all the series. All three of them.

18:13.886 --> 18:18.015
And The Twilight Zone,
and The Bob Newhart Show.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.977
M*A*S*H, Columbo...

18:31.320 --> 18:32.321
Margo.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.115
Come on in.

18:35.741 --> 18:36.742
Thank you.

18:49.713 --> 18:50.714
Is--

18:51.715 --> 18:53.383
I got here a couple of hours ago.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.970
You sure nobody saw you come in?

18:56.970 --> 19:01.225
I parked four blocks away,
went through neighbors' yards.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.436
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.065
Shall we get started?

19:09.149 --> 19:13.362
Okay. We can use these updated
CG estimates to determine thrust vectors.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.409
I think you also need
to consider center-of-mass dispersion.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.829
From inertial compressive forces
during the burn.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.373
- That's really smart.
- Agreed.

19:24.373 --> 19:29.920
The trajectory's set, Earth will be mining
Goldilocks in less than nine months.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.007
It is a good thing, yes.
But it is nonetheless a shame.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.092
What is?

19:35.592 --> 19:39.012
The asteroid will come to Earth
and all investment with it.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.557
There will be no more reason
to put money into Mars.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.934
The M-7 is very committed to Mars.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.769
- They said--
- Yeah, what they always say.

19:46.562 --> 19:50.858
But Korzhenko only cares
about enriching himself and his cronies.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.068
The asteroid now will do this,

19:53.068 --> 19:57.114
so they will withdraw from Mars,
then NASA will too.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.075
Just like they did with the Mars program
in the '80s.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.411
Until we forced their hand.
Remember, Margo?

20:03.787 --> 20:05.706
Without competition, there is no progress.

20:06.290 --> 20:10.419
Okay. I think that's enough
geopolitical fun for one night.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.213
Kids, come on. Clear the plates.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.841
- Sorry to have hijacked your home, Victor.
- No, no.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.635
No, it's okay. Please keep going.
They just need to go to sleep.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.345
Dad. It's only 9:00.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.430
I know. Come on.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.558
Hey.

20:27.144 --> 20:30.564
Before you go,
how about a little palate cleanser?

20:33.442 --> 20:34.651
Thanks.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.288
Thanks.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.506
Margo. I also have a little gift for you.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.930
- And don't forget to brush your teeth.
- I haven't listened to this record in...

21:04.973 --> 21:06.058
too long.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.142
Thank you, Sergei.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.104
Have you--

21:11.730 --> 21:13.774
have you thought more about my idea?

21:15.234 --> 21:16.318
Us leaving?

21:19.488 --> 21:21.156
I've-- I haven't had much time.

21:21.949 --> 21:24.785
We've just still got so much to do.

21:24.785 --> 21:27.704
Once this asteroid
is on a course for Earth,

21:29.331 --> 21:31.959
Irina Morozova will order you
back to Moscow,

21:33.210 --> 21:35.128
and we will never see each other again.

21:37.506 --> 21:41.635
You-- You don't know that.
There may be other opportunities.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.053
No, there will not.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.724
Then what?

21:49.017 --> 21:50.477
We just run,

21:51.645 --> 21:54.189
hide out in some apartment somewhere,

21:54.189 --> 21:57.693
and stare at the walls
for the next 20 years?

21:59.486 --> 22:00.487
No.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.992
I have a friend
high up in the Brazilian space program.

22:04.992 --> 22:06.535
We reach out to him,

22:07.035 --> 22:10.706
offer our services in exchange
for protection of their government.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.877
You think they would go for it?

22:16.503 --> 22:17.796
They would be overjoyed.

22:18.881 --> 22:22.426
You and I, we could help build Brazil
into a major space power.

22:31.435 --> 22:34.980
It would be like
the early Apollo-Soyuz days.

22:35.522 --> 22:38.150
I suggest Soyuz-Apollo

22:38.734 --> 22:40.485
for the sake of convenience.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.492
Together we will finish
what we've started.

22:53.874 --> 22:54.875
I'll...

22:56.919 --> 22:57.920
have to think about it.

22:59.296 --> 23:00.964
There is so little time, Margo.

23:00.964 --> 23:05.135
I know. I just need
to see this mission through first.

23:29.910 --> 23:33.914
<i>The video tap serial number,
which you can see here,</i>

23:33.914 --> 23:38.043
indicates the component arrived on Phoenix
with the last transport.

23:38.043 --> 23:41.839
It was duly scanned in.
There is no record of it leaving Phoenix.

23:42.506 --> 23:45.634
<i>And indeed, the cargo master found the box</i>

23:46.385 --> 23:48.512
<i>right where the inventory said
it would be.</i>

23:49.346 --> 23:50.639
<i>The seal was not broken,</i>

23:50.639 --> 23:55.477
<i>but when she opened the box,
the contents had been replaced.</i>

23:56.562 --> 24:00.649
<i>Now, Eli, I'm sure you'll agree
that this indicates a serious problem.</i>

24:01.650 --> 24:03.569
<i>The last inventory was a month ago.</i>

24:04.152 --> 24:07.573
<i>At that time, all the crew did
was scan the packaging.</i>

24:08.574 --> 24:12.411
<i>They did not check
that the contents matched the labels.</i>

24:12.411 --> 24:17.916
<i>So I ordered a thorough inventory,
which revealed substantial thefts--</i>

24:17.916 --> 24:20.460
<i>largely communications and computer gear--</i>

24:20.460 --> 24:23.297
<i>which you will find listed
in the attached file.</i>

24:25.299 --> 24:28.385
<i>Eli, I think we have a real problem here.</i>

24:29.136 --> 24:33.640
<i>Not just theft
but possibly something much more serious.</i>

24:35.601 --> 24:38.478
<i>I mean, what could they want
with all that equipment?</i>

24:50.157 --> 24:51.783
Get Will Tyler up here.

24:52.284 --> 24:55.370
And see if you can get Irina Morozova
on the horn in Moscow.

26:14.032 --> 26:17.619
Commander Cho, your tea is ready.

27:02.748 --> 27:04.625
ELEVATOR ACCESS RESTRICTED

27:14.468 --> 27:17.554
The CIA has reviewed the list
of stolen equipment.

27:17.554 --> 27:20.766
It's highly sophisticated communications
gear that has no practical value

27:20.766 --> 27:22.434
on the black market.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.602
Then why steal it?

27:24.561 --> 27:28.440
Its only purpose is to monitor
and communicate with a spacecraft.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.568
Now, the only spacecraft carrying cargo
with any significant value

27:31.568 --> 27:34.863
- within the vicinity of Mars is--
- Ranger.

27:34.863 --> 27:35.948
Fuck!

27:36.949 --> 27:39.618
<i>Given the recent acts of sabotage
in Happy Valley,</i>

27:39.618 --> 27:42.371
<i>we must treat this with utmost urgency.</i>

27:43.830 --> 27:46.375
Do you think someone wants
to sabotage the asteroid mission?

27:47.751 --> 27:51.046
We should assume so. There's too much
at stake to turn a blind eye to this.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.299
Here we are,
on the cusp of transforming the lives

27:54.299 --> 27:57.594
of over six billion people for the better,

27:57.594 --> 28:02.474
and a handful of anarchists
want to blow it all up.

28:03.475 --> 28:06.311
- Why?
- As Dostoevsky once said,

28:06.311 --> 28:09.982
<i>if you build a crystal palace,
no matter how resplendent,</i>

28:09.982 --> 28:14.111
<i>there will always be some asshole
who wants to bring it crashing down.</i>

28:14.111 --> 28:16.071
<i>I'm simplifying, of course.</i>

28:17.364 --> 28:18.824
Well, whoever it is,

28:18.824 --> 28:22.286
we need to find them before they commit
acts of violence against Ranger.

28:23.579 --> 28:25.664
We've got good people on that ship,

28:25.664 --> 28:28.250
and I won't have any more lives lost
on my watch.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.252
There are less than 24 hours
until the burn.

28:30.252 --> 28:33.088
If they're gonna do anything,
they'll do it before then.

28:34.131 --> 28:37.968
<i>I recommend activating
our undercover assets in Happy Valley</i>

28:37.968 --> 28:39.720
<i>to gather more intelligence.</i>

28:40.470 --> 28:44.391
<i>Let the CIA and KGB find
whoever is behind this.</i>

28:50.606 --> 28:53.150
Tim, get me Director Hanlin.

29:00.908 --> 29:03.660
Can't say I'm surprised that
there's intelligence operatives up here,

29:03.660 --> 29:06.830
but, Mike,
never thought you were one of them.

29:06.830 --> 29:09.249
Well, I wouldn't be much good at my job
if you did.

29:10.876 --> 29:12.169
And Mr. Avilov.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.796
Now, you were pretty vocal
during the strike.

29:14.796 --> 29:19.843
An operative must move amongst
the people as fish swim in the sea.

29:21.136 --> 29:25.265
So what, the KGB and CIA
are working hand in hand now?

29:25.265 --> 29:28.018
Just like you did for Apollo-Soyuz.

29:28.018 --> 29:30.646
Yes, that was very courageous.

29:33.232 --> 29:37.986
Well, we are all aware how important
Goldilocks is to our two countries.

29:38.487 --> 29:40.697
Which is why we gotta
get to the bottom of this.

29:41.323 --> 29:45.369
People's lives are at stake here.
People we all know up on Ranger.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.622
We have a few ideas on where to start.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.416
Good. One last thing.

29:51.416 --> 29:55.754
The North Koreans mentioned someone named
Miles Dale to me. Maybe it's nothing.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.047
I know him well.

29:57.548 --> 29:58.966
He runs black market.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.427
He could be involved.

30:04.596 --> 30:06.723
Good to know. We'll interview him.

30:06.723 --> 30:08.559
Good. Keep me in the loop.

30:08.559 --> 30:11.311
In the meantime,
I'll authorize another search at the base.

30:20.445 --> 30:21.446
Dad?

30:41.758 --> 30:42.926
Kel.

30:44.428 --> 30:45.429
Hi, Dad.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.433
Hey. Everything okay?

30:49.433 --> 30:50.726
We need to talk.

30:50.726 --> 30:51.852
I'm sorry, kiddo.

30:51.852 --> 30:54.479
I really-- I can't right now. So...

30:54.479 --> 30:56.648
- Why not?
- I just can't.

30:56.648 --> 30:59.026
I'm in the middle of something
with work, so...

30:59.902 --> 31:00.903
Yeah.

31:01.570 --> 31:02.571
Yeah, I know.

31:02.571 --> 31:07.576
There are search teams tossing the
entire base looking for missing com gear.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.703
- Yeah.
- You know anything about that?

31:09.703 --> 31:11.246
No. Why would I?

31:11.914 --> 31:15.751
I don't know. You used to think
Dev Ayesa was the devil incarnate.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.671
Now you two are acting like best friends
whispering in corners.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.343
Why don't you tell me
what's really going on?

31:24.343 --> 31:27.179
- Nothing's going on. I swear.
- Stop lying to me.

31:29.348 --> 31:33.143
You think I can't tell,
but I know you, Dad.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.772
You've been lying to me
ever since I got here.

31:38.398 --> 31:39.399
Before that even.

31:40.984 --> 31:42.694
What's really going on with you?

32:43.172 --> 32:44.256
Stand back.

32:45.215 --> 32:46.258
Is it right?

32:49.553 --> 32:51.054
SL3-17.

32:58.103 --> 33:02.691
- Where are you headed?
- SL3-14. Environmental system repair.

33:05.444 --> 33:06.445
Go ahead.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.167
Come in.

33:20.167 --> 33:23.378
Hello, gents.
I'm here to fix your circulation problem.

33:23.879 --> 33:24.880
Glad to hear it.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.424
Yeah, we have a big problem.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.222
But not with the circulation.

33:34.473 --> 33:35.766
Have a seat.

33:36.975 --> 33:39.478
When I was younger,
I wasn't afraid of anything.

33:40.521 --> 33:41.730
Not even death.

33:43.607 --> 33:46.693
I always thought I'd go out in a...

33:48.695 --> 33:49.947
blaze of glory.

33:55.244 --> 33:56.537
Gordo.

33:57.079 --> 33:59.748
He once told me about his father
when he got cancer.

34:00.624 --> 34:03.293
His dad was a marine. Tough as nails, but...

34:05.254 --> 34:06.463
towards the end...

34:09.716 --> 34:11.092
he was terrified.

34:12.886 --> 34:13.887
Weak.

34:16.806 --> 34:17.808
I just--

34:18.809 --> 34:20.435
I don't wanna wind up like that, Kel.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.031
The reason I didn't want to come home,

34:33.031 --> 34:37.953
'cause I don't wanna end up
in a nursing home

34:38.871 --> 34:40.539
with a diaper,

34:41.498 --> 34:46.545
wearing a drool cup,
squeezing a ball of wax in front of the TV

34:46.545 --> 34:48.672
and not remembering
who the hell I am anymore.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.386
Up here, I--

34:56.346 --> 34:57.973
I'm doing something meaningful.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.185
I'm building something.

35:02.728 --> 35:04.855
Something that could last after I'm gone.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.566
S-- Place where my...

35:09.735 --> 35:10.986
grandson could live.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.115
Possibly even his children too.

35:18.035 --> 35:20.287
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

35:25.542 --> 35:26.543
I thought you'd...

35:30.380 --> 35:31.715
think I was crazy.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.679
I don't think you're crazy.

35:41.725 --> 35:42.726
Maybe a little.

35:53.654 --> 35:54.863
I'm sorry, Kel.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.492
I should have been there for you and Alex.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.337
And I never should have lied to you.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.841
Never.

36:18.637 --> 36:19.972
Yeah.

36:22.307 --> 36:23.308
Yeah.

36:34.778 --> 36:37.155
So you're gonna tell me
what you and Dev are up to?

36:42.244 --> 36:45.914
Radios, cabling,
network switches, monitors.

36:45.914 --> 36:47.708
There's pages of this.

36:47.708 --> 36:51.128
Items scanned in for shipment,
then suddenly disappeared.

36:51.128 --> 36:52.921
Wow. Someone took all that?

36:56.967 --> 37:01.513
I mean, here you are looking at charges
of smuggling, tax evasion,

37:01.513 --> 37:03.557
and you won't help yourself.

37:04.141 --> 37:06.685
You just laugh it off like it's nothing.

37:07.186 --> 37:10.063
I don't know who took all that stuff.
I mean, think about it.

37:10.063 --> 37:13.775
I sell underwear and mouthwash
and foot powder.

37:13.775 --> 37:16.528
Things that make people's lives
a little bit easier up here.

37:16.528 --> 37:20.282
Who would want this com gear anyway?
I mean, it has no practical use.

37:20.782 --> 37:22.492
Unless you want to fuck with Ranger.

37:23.368 --> 37:24.745
Dev Ayesa broke strike.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.664
A lot of people are still
pretty pissed off about that.

37:28.165 --> 37:31.084
Maybe so pissed they came to you for help
to get their revenge.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.962
Why would I risk everything?
I mean, everything I've built.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.300
I was against the strike
right from the very beginning anyway.

37:38.300 --> 37:40.010
You could ask anybody, they'll tell you.

37:40.010 --> 37:44.389
You want us to go ask a bunch
of terrorists to vouch for you.

37:45.182 --> 37:48.227
Nick Jennings was a friend of mine.

37:49.228 --> 37:52.272
Did you know his suit melted
into his flesh?

37:53.315 --> 37:55.776
Can you imagine the unbearable pain

37:56.443 --> 37:58.737
he must have been going through
in his final moments?

38:01.949 --> 38:03.951
I swear I had nothing to do with that.

38:11.375 --> 38:12.584
Hey, man. Hey--

38:14.628 --> 38:16.296
- Hey!
- Get the fuck down.

38:16.296 --> 38:17.381
Look, man!

38:17.381 --> 38:21.134
Fuck, you're breaking my arms, dude.
Fucking shit, man.

38:55.586 --> 38:57.004
Fifteen meters or something.

38:57.004 --> 38:58.672
Yeah, just about.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.093
- Okay.
- Think you can do it?

39:03.594 --> 39:04.636
Yeah...

39:09.933 --> 39:12.561
There's an access tunnel. If you wanna go.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.147
Okay. Show me.

39:16.899 --> 39:22.446
So right here, you can access by the
main tunnel without anybody seeing you.

39:23.447 --> 39:25.115
It's been a while since...

39:26.825 --> 39:28.368
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.996
He'd still be here.

39:38.754 --> 39:40.005
Okay. So,

39:40.005 --> 39:43.509
what you're gonna do is you'll be
going through the access tunnel.

39:44.009 --> 39:45.802
You got any family down on Earth?

39:46.470 --> 39:50.766
Both of 'em.
Brother and two sisters. Parents.

39:55.062 --> 39:58.190
We're gonna be in Happy Valley
a lot longer than we planned.

39:58.190 --> 40:01.568
Gotta think Dev and Old Man
Mars will have a plan for that too.

40:01.568 --> 40:02.986
It's been a while since we...

40:05.030 --> 40:06.365
Don't particularly...

40:08.158 --> 40:09.159
What the fuck?

40:12.287 --> 40:13.622
Oh, shit.

40:22.089 --> 40:23.090
Call the guys.

40:24.216 --> 40:26.343
What the fuck?

40:26.927 --> 40:28.428
What the fuck, man?

41:04.339 --> 41:05.716
What the fuck?
