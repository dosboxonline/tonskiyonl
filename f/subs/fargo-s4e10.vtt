46:46.036 --> 46:48.647
I've got the invoice here.

46:48.822 --> 46:53.087
The total cost
comes out to $8,700.

46:54.218 --> 46:55.437
That's not how it works.

46:55.611 --> 46:58.788
8,700 in agreed-upon services.

47:01.573 --> 47:03.358
Plus this.

47:10.147 --> 47:11.583
Gold ring.

47:11.757 --> 47:15.065
Pawn shop'd give you
four, five hundred.

47:15.239 --> 47:18.460
Which would leave you at...

47:18.634 --> 47:20.636
who the hell cares?

47:20.810 --> 47:23.552
I already told you--
that's not how it works.

47:23.726 --> 47:27.295
No. You haven't seen the part
that makes it priceless yet.

47:27.469 --> 47:30.298
The part that's gonna make you
give me what I want.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.172
There's a nurse who lives
across the street from me.

47:35.346 --> 47:36.608
She had the ring.

47:36.782 --> 47:40.047
So now you're selling me
a stolen ring.

47:40.221 --> 47:43.702
She had a lot of other things,
this nurse.

47:43.877 --> 47:45.966
Took them from her patients.

47:46.140 --> 47:48.969
Kept them in a closet
next to their obituaries,

47:49.143 --> 47:52.494
and medicine she gave them
to help them pass on.

47:52.668 --> 47:54.844
This nurse?

47:55.018 --> 47:57.673
Cops arrested her last night.

47:57.847 --> 48:01.155
She poisons people, see?

48:01.329 --> 48:03.113
And takes their things.

48:03.287 --> 48:06.334
A keepsake, like this ring.

48:06.508 --> 48:08.771
And I started thinking.

48:08.945 --> 48:11.513
Whose ring is it?

48:11.687 --> 48:14.559
So, I went to the library,

48:14.733 --> 48:16.692
and looked through the obits.

48:32.534 --> 48:34.623
I want you to give my folks
their house back.

48:34.797 --> 48:36.059
And their business.

48:36.233 --> 48:38.235
All debts forgave.

48:38.409 --> 48:39.976
And just what the hell
do you think you've got

48:40.150 --> 48:42.544
that's gonna make me do that?

48:42.718 --> 48:45.199
I'm gonna help you win your war.

48:46.417 --> 48:48.942
[sighs]

48:49.116 --> 48:51.727
You do that,
you can have anything you want.

48:54.034 --> 48:55.949
Swear it.

48:56.993 --> 48:59.213
Swear.

49:01.345 --> 49:02.912
