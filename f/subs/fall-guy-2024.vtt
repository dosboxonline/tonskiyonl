- Jody, right?
- What's your name again?

As you can see,
that is not my chin.

02:47.848 --> 02:50.081
When you look at my face, look
at my jaw compared to his jaw,

02:50.081 --> 02:51.753
it's like his chin is off.

02:51.753 --> 02:52.919
It's like... -Yeah,
we can't replace his face.

02:52.919 --> 02:54.591
It's like Mr. Potato Head.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.494
I mean, no offense or
anything, but you know. -Oh...

02:56.494 --> 02:58.595
Oh, yeah, no. Sorry, I got lost
in your beautiful jawline.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.399
- It's dreamy.
-  No, listen,

it's not working for us.

03:43.541 --> 03:45.477

03:45.477 --> 03:47.237
- to ask me something.
- Oh.

03:47.237 --> 03:49.415
I was gonna go for
a spicy margarita after work.

03:49.415 --> 03:51.318
I was wondering
if you drink spicy margaritas.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.114
Um, well,
just to keep it professional,

03:56.114 --> 03:57.951
I can only have
one spicy margarita.

03:57.951 --> 04:00.954
Because if I have two,
I start making bad decisions.

04:00.954 --> 04:02.791
Well, you know,
drinking margaritas

04:02.791 --> 04:05.596
is all about
making bad decisions.

04:05.596 --> 04:07.763
Which reminds me, um,

04:07.763 --> 04:11.063
after this job, I-I got to go
sit on the sand somewhere,

04:11.063 --> 04:13.670
and I was wondering, uh...
I was gonna ask you a question.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.166
Tell me.

04:16.268 --> 04:18.642
Do you have any towels
that I can borrow?

04:19.973 --> 04:21.480
Yeah, I have some towels.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.240
You know, it's so dangerous
to swim alone.

04:24.846 --> 04:27.145
Well, I would ask you to,
you know, be my swim buddy,

04:27.145 --> 04:29.147
but I don't know
if you have a bathing suit.

04:29.147 --> 04:32.524
Wait a second. What do you
call that across the pond?

04:32.524 --> 04:35.461
We call it a swimming costume.

04:37.628 --> 04:39.157
Imagine that.

04:39.157 --> 04:41.159
After this,
you and I could both be

04:41.159 --> 04:43.964
on the beach somewhere
in swimming costumes

04:43.964 --> 04:45.768
drinking spicy margaritas,

04:45.768 --> 04:48.133
- making bad decisions.
-Okay, good to go.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.871
Imagine that.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.039
Okay, let's keep it
locked up all around!

04:55.173 --> 04:57.241
- Let's strap him in.
- Everyone quiet, please!

04:58.585 --> 05:00.244
- Speed on "A."

05:03.150 --> 05:05.524
You all right? -All right,
let's take him to ones.

05:05.524 --> 05:08.725
- Tail slate. -Going to ones.
- Go ahead and sit back for me.

05:09.992 --> 05:11.497

05:11.497 --> 05:13.664
- And going out to the edge.
- Stunts is hot.

05:13.664 --> 05:15.897
- Take up the slack.
- How we doing up there, stunt?

05:15.897 --> 05:18.900
- Great. He's great. Here we go.
- Position down.

05:19.936 --> 05:21.771

05:23.368 --> 05:24.840

06:50.123 --> 06:51.256
A valet.

06:51.256 --> 06:53.467
Wow! I didn't believe it.

06:53.467 --> 06:56.503

07:08.273 --> 07:09.747
Number 43.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.816
- Hey.

07:14.622 --> 07:16.919
Yo, bro, I know you
from somewhere.

07:16.919 --> 07:18.624
Where I know you from, bro?

07:18.624 --> 07:22.089
Oh, yeah, you were on
that Tom Ryder movie I was on.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.289
- You're the stunt guy!
- Not anymore.

07:24.289 --> 07:27.028
Did you, like, break your back
or some shit? -I did, yeah.

07:27.028 --> 07:31.197
I know things haven't been easy
for you since... the incident.

07:31.197 --> 07:32.836
And I just hope

07:32.836 --> 07:35.839
that you don't hold it
against me or Tom.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.303
You know, we were
absolutely devastated.

07:38.303 --> 07:39.711
He sent you a message, right?

07:42.144 --> 07:43.440
The prayer hands emoji?

07:43.440 --> 07:46.014
Right, yeah.
He's still an asshole.

07:46.014 --> 07:47.851
How are you even still alive?
Yo, babe.

07:47.851 --> 07:49.556
- Babe, hey, come here.
- I don't know.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.854
- I wish I wasn't right now.
- You got to meet this guy.

07:50.854 --> 07:52.350
Come here.
You got to hear this.

07:52.350 --> 07:54.220
You don't have to hear this.
It's fine. Hi.

07:54.220 --> 07:55.793
This dude was on a movie
I was on.

07:55.793 --> 07:59.896
- Most epic fail I've ever seen.
-Mm.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.568
<i>I don't blame
either one of you, Gail.</i>

08:01.568 --> 08:03.064
That was my fault.

08:03.064 --> 08:04.868
And when you start
making mistakes like that,

08:04.868 --> 08:06.298
it's time to hang up the pads.

08:06.298 --> 08:08.003
Oh, it was an accident, Colt.

08:08.003 --> 08:10.137
Everybody knows that.

08:10.137 --> 08:14.504
Tom has put me
in a real situation here, Colt.

08:14.504 --> 08:17.408
I just need a little bit
of help from an old friend,

08:17.408 --> 08:20.015
who just happens to be,
you know, the best stuntman

08:20.015 --> 08:21.819
I've ever worked with
in my life.

08:21.819 --> 08:24.217
Which is why you are getting
on a plane for me tomorrow

08:24.217 --> 08:25.823
and coming to Sydney.

08:25.823 --> 08:27.561
I'm not getting
on a plane, Gail.

08:27.561 --> 08:29.563
I can't bear that you would
throw away all that talent.

08:29.563 --> 08:31.994
You shouldn't be
parking cars, Colt.

08:31.994 --> 08:34.667
You need to be smashing
burning Kawasakis

08:34.667 --> 08:35.899
through panes of glass.

08:35.899 --> 08:38.264
Yo, fall guy? Yo.

08:38.264 --> 08:41.399
Bring my car back
without a scratch,

08:41.399 --> 08:43.577

Come on.
It's gonna be like old times.

09:08.063 --> 09:09.735

Wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Hold on.

Did I, did I tell you-- I--
Did I tell you

09:15.202 --> 09:16.907

Sorry to disappoint him.

11:24.199 --> 11:25.904
Eh, it's new technology.

11:25.904 --> 11:28.071
Basically, we use
the geometry of your face

11:28.071 --> 11:29.666
to retarget Ryder's face,

11:29.666 --> 11:32.174

Hey, welcome to Sydney.
Are you Colt Seavers?

11:41.282 --> 11:43.757
Yeah. Hey. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?

11:43.757 --> 11:45.517
This jet lag
is really kicking in.

11:45.517 --> 11:46.892
Yeah, no stress. I got you.

11:46.892 --> 11:48.762
And does the director know
I'm here?

11:48.762 --> 11:50.060
- She asked for me.
- Uh...

11:50.060 --> 11:51.259
Does-does she want
to say hi or...?

11:51.259 --> 11:53.228
I haven't heard.
No, sorry, bro.

11:53.228 --> 11:54.966
Uh, but the stunt coordinator
wants to see you.

11:54.966 --> 11:57.463
- He's just in the jacket there.
- Okay, great.

11:57.463 --> 11:59.300
Will you just tell her
I'm here and...

11:59.300 --> 12:00.873
you know, that coffee
if you get a chance?

12:00.873 --> 12:02.138
Oh.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.634
- Dan Tucker.

12:03.634 --> 12:06.406
Big-time Hollywood
stunt coordinator.

12:07.607 --> 12:08.947
It's about time.

12:08.947 --> 12:10.608
- Congratulations.

12:10.608 --> 12:12.247
Thank you. Look at you.

12:12.247 --> 12:14.447
So do I call you "sir" now,
or how does that work?

12:14.447 --> 12:16.383
Oh, feel free
to call me "boss," you know.

12:16.383 --> 12:17.923
- Okay, boss.

12:17.923 --> 12:19.749
I don't think I should be
in this Nomex, right?

12:19.749 --> 12:21.619
I mean, it's like, we're not
doing anything crazy, are we?

12:21.619 --> 12:23.060
I was just about
to explain that.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.897
A cannon roll?!

12:24.897 --> 12:26.723
It's time for you to start
rolling cars again

12:26.723 --> 12:28.098
instead of parking them.

12:28.098 --> 12:30.166
You had an accident.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.433
It was a massive
miscalculation of the rig.

12:33.433 --> 12:35.237
I-I almost killed myself
in front of the whole crew.

12:35.237 --> 12:37.404
You know, I'd rather just not
have my first stunt back

12:37.404 --> 12:39.571
be another epic failure,
especially in front of Jody.

12:39.571 --> 12:41.078
I mean, you understand.

12:41.078 --> 12:43.674
"It's not about how hard
of a hit you can give."

12:43.674 --> 12:45.676
- Oh.
-"It's about how many times

12:45.676 --> 12:49.581
you can get hit and keep
moving forward." -Come on.

12:49.581 --> 12:52.826
That's messed up. You can't
quote Rocky on me like that.

12:52.826 --> 12:55.620
So it's a laser gun
with a dagger?

12:55.620 --> 12:57.358
Yes,
like a bayonet. -Right.

12:57.358 --> 12:59.030
Do we need the bayonet?
Wouldn't the laser achieve...

12:59.030 --> 13:00.658
On the battlefield, yes.
Hundred percent.

13:00.658 --> 13:02.528
It just gives it
a quite a strange shape.

13:02.528 --> 13:04.101
- Oh, this guitar bit at the end?
- Yeah.

13:04.101 --> 13:05.762
Yeah, well, you said
you wanted metal,

13:05.762 --> 13:07.269
so it's, like, heavy metal.

13:07.269 --> 13:09.106
Okay, how-how... how many
have you done like this?

13:09.106 --> 13:10.437
- Uh, two.
- Okay. Good.

13:10.437 --> 13:12.505
- Hundred.
- Ooh. Okay. Yeah, fantastic.

13:12.505 --> 13:14.705
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay. It looks like a guitar.

13:14.705 --> 13:16.641
Yes. -Nigel, how we doing
on the pyrotechnics?

13:16.641 --> 13:18.280
What's going on? -I think we
only have enough for one take.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.886
- Boss! Boss, listen.
- No. Come on. -Yes.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.613
Yes? -We could create
something that looks

13:21.613 --> 13:23.186
- way more realistic with VFX.
- No, no, no.

13:23.186 --> 13:24.550
- Come on. Give it to me.
- Venti, Venti, Venti.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.123
I don't want real.
I don't want real.

13:26.123 --> 13:28.125
This is a sci-fi epic,
cosmic love story. -Why?

13:28.125 --> 13:29.687
Okay? Of cosmic proportions.

13:29.687 --> 13:31.656
It's got to mirror
that otherworldly thing

13:31.656 --> 13:33.229
when you fall in love.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.692
You know, it's-it's imperfect.
It's beautiful.

13:34.692 --> 13:36.199
I want it that way, okay?

13:36.199 --> 13:38.135
Let's go big with
our one take, okay? -Okay.

13:38.135 --> 13:39.466
- Holy shit.

13:39.466 --> 13:40.665
Was that it?
Was that my one take?

13:40.665 --> 13:41.831
Uh, I'm sure we have--

13:41.831 --> 13:43.635
- Oh, my God!

13:43.635 --> 13:45.142
Well, I got to say, though,
looks absolutely fantastic.

13:45.142 --> 13:46.407
-Boss. Listen, listen.
- Look at that.

13:46.407 --> 13:48.079
You sure you want
to use real pyros?

13:48.079 --> 13:49.377
Yeah. -VENTI: But we
definitely don't need this.

13:49.377 --> 13:50.884
- No, no, no, no. Yeah.
- We don't.

13:50.884 --> 13:52.182
Well, we're just gonna
have to loop the actors.

13:52.182 --> 13:53.678
- That's all.
- That's okay, Ray.

13:53.678 --> 13:55.317
It's a stuntman in a car
with a helmet on, okay?

13:55.317 --> 13:56.714
- Oh. Uh, all right.
- No looping. No monologuing.

13:56.714 --> 13:57.649
What the hell is going on
over there, Rush?

13:57.649 --> 13:58.925
We did not call for pyro.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.223
I will seriously
track down your family

14:00.223 --> 14:01.521
and kill every last one of them!

14:01.521 --> 14:03.193
This is why they're doing it.

14:03.193 --> 14:04.997
'Cause they feel you don't
respect them, Nigel, okay?

14:04.997 --> 14:06.592
It's my tone. -Your tone,
your words, all of it, just...

14:06.592 --> 14:08.935
- I see, okay. -Jody? Jody?
- Darla, yes? Okay. Yeah.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.695
Jody, um, sorry, I...
I couldn't get my printer

14:10.695 --> 14:12.169
- working last night...
- Okay, yep.

14:12.169 --> 14:13.665
...but I sort of synthesized
our conversation

14:13.665 --> 14:15.502
that we had on the third act,
and what if

14:15.502 --> 14:18.505
one of the characters in the
film acknowledges in the film

14:18.505 --> 14:20.771
that we're having a problem
with the third act?

14:20.771 --> 14:22.542
- Yeah?
- No. No.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.873
But I appreciate you thinking
outside the box, Darla.

14:23.873 --> 14:25.050
- I really, really do.

14:25.050 --> 14:26.843
Nigel, you've got to stop them.

14:26.843 --> 14:28.185
I will gut you like the pigs
that you are! -Oh, my God.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.681
- Stop testing!
- Whoo!

14:29.681 --> 14:31.056
-Boss!
- Yep?

14:31.056 --> 14:33.091
- Test went well.
- Fantastic.

14:33.091 --> 14:35.885
Okay, so, guys, simmer down.
Eyes on me.

14:35.885 --> 14:37.425
Here's what's gonna happen.

14:37.425 --> 14:39.229
No VFX, Venti.
It looks absolutely fabulous.

14:39.229 --> 14:41.099
Nigel, we need to shoot now.
The tide's coming in.

14:41.099 --> 14:42.463
Let's go.
The shot's gonna be epic.

14:42.463 --> 14:44.795
Shot's up in five, people.
Thank you.

14:55.984 --> 14:57.610
-Colt? Brother?

14:57.610 --> 14:59.480
What's happening, man?

15:00.945 --> 15:02.780
- Bad sand.
- Bad sand.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.320
Yeah.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.157
I think we got to postpone.
Hate to say it.

15:06.157 --> 15:08.126
NIGEL
Dan, what's the delay, please?

15:08.126 --> 15:10.095
Uh, we're just doing
a little safety check.

15:10.095 --> 15:11.393
It's the density.
It's bad density.

15:11.393 --> 15:13.263
We're looking at
the density of the sand.

15:13.263 --> 15:14.495
There's a new driver.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.068
- Who is it? Where's Henry?
- No idea.

15:16.068 --> 15:18.268
Nigel, this is
the biggest shot of the film,

15:18.268 --> 15:19.764
and I have a newbie.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.602
- Dan says we can do it.
- Okay.

15:22.602 --> 15:25.407
Seriously, we're gonna drift
all over the place.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.079
What is that, a king tide?

15:27.079 --> 15:28.806
Here's what you do.
You wait till it comes in.

15:28.806 --> 15:31.446
It compacts the sand,
then we shoot sunset for sunup.

15:31.446 --> 15:32.612
You're stalling.

15:32.612 --> 15:34.350
- Maybe.
- You're stalling.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.254
Two things can be true.
-Brother, I've got

15:37.254 --> 15:39.751
a tent full of
rookie Australians out here.

15:39.751 --> 15:40.950
I'm gonna be sick.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.622
You got this. You're the one.

15:42.622 --> 15:43.623
- Why you got to say that?
- Okay?

15:43.623 --> 15:44.789
Why you got to say that?

15:44.789 --> 15:46.263
You've done this
a million times.

15:46.263 --> 15:48.298
And so have you.
You know, you just jinxed it.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.037
You just jinxed it!

15:51.037 --> 15:52.500
Hey, Dan, I need the driver
in the car now, please.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.831
- Okay, the tide's coming up.
-Okay.

15:53.831 --> 15:55.008
Thank you so much.
Appreciate you.

15:55.008 --> 15:56.042
- Is that Jody?
- Yes, it's Jody.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.540
She say something about me?

15:59.540 --> 16:02.807
Stop with-- your-your face.
Stop it. Stop it.

16:02.807 --> 16:05.117
She didn't say
anything about you.

16:05.117 --> 16:06.844
Get in the car!

16:09.651 --> 16:11.321
This is really important to her.

16:11.321 --> 16:12.949
Yes, it's important to her.

16:12.949 --> 16:15.391
- Is this Comic-Con or something?
- Hall H.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.229
"This is one of those times,

16:18.229 --> 16:21.430
whether it's an inch or a mile,
a win is a win."

16:23.764 --> 16:25.467
That's easy.
<i>Fast and the Furious.</i>

16:25.467 --> 16:26.897
Ah!

16:26.897 --> 16:29.042
- Let's go. You got this.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.373
Did you see the coffee lady?

16:30.373 --> 16:31.572
She was wearing, like, a hat.

16:31.572 --> 16:33.079
- I see you in the car.
- Okay.

16:34.247 --> 16:35.741
Let's get
the medics in place, please.

16:35.741 --> 16:37.809
This is the hero set.
I've got five more after that.

16:37.809 --> 16:39.217
Are you ready, Dan? Yeah.

16:39.217 --> 16:41.384
-Rock and roll.
-Lock it up!

16:41.384 --> 16:43.419
-Thank you.
-Three minute away--

16:44.455 --> 16:45.586
NIGEL
Okay, folks,

16:45.586 --> 16:47.093
he's buckled in.
Stunts are ready.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.655
MAN
Godspeed, Colt.

16:48.655 --> 16:50.426
Everybody knows their spots.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.428
Everybody knows
their responsibilities.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.660
NIGEL
FX, please go hot on the cannon.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.167
Do this right.

16:55.167 --> 16:56.597
MAN
Okay, engaging the cannon now.

16:56.597 --> 16:58.071
We do this safe
and everybody goes home.

16:58.071 --> 16:59.666
MAN 2
Charging the cannon.

16:59.666 --> 17:02.207
MAN
2,000 PSI in the cannon.

17:02.207 --> 17:03.868
Stunts is good.

17:03.868 --> 17:05.903
MAN 2
Cannon is hot.

17:05.903 --> 17:07.509
NIGEL
Cameras, where are we at?

17:07.509 --> 17:09.005
Are you rolling? Camera one?

17:09.005 --> 17:10.413
-Speed on one.
-Camera two?

17:10.413 --> 17:11.876
-Speed.
-Camera three?

17:11.876 --> 17:13.251
-Speed on three.

17:17.717 --> 17:21.358
Background.
And three, two, one.

17:21.358 --> 17:22.953
Action, action, action!

17:28.598 --> 17:30.026
All right, guys, stay frosty.

17:30.026 --> 17:32.072
NIGEL
Three, two, one!

17:38.971 --> 17:41.477
Dan, I need him close to the
camera now. -DAN: Copy that!

17:42.909 --> 17:44.315
Look,
I don't want to be that guy,

17:44.315 --> 17:45.778
but the sand's a little loose.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.549
I can't get any traction.

17:47.549 --> 17:49.287
When I do, it jumps,

17:49.287 --> 17:51.916
so if you get any closer,
you're gonna lose the camera.

17:51.916 --> 17:53.621
I know, I know,
but get in there.

17:53.621 --> 17:55.689
- You got this, baby!
- Move up, move up.

17:57.759 --> 17:59.660
No, no, not that close.
Oh. What the--

18:00.663 --> 18:02.091
NIGEL
Keep rolling.

18:02.091 --> 18:03.631
We have seven more cameras.
Keep rolling!

18:03.631 --> 18:05.633
Okay!

18:05.633 --> 18:08.537
Ready in three, two, one!

18:33.366 --> 18:34.761
NIGEL
Nobody goes in

18:34.761 --> 18:36.334
until stunts gives
the all clear.

18:43.871 --> 18:45.310
- Is he all right?
- Colt, you all right?

18:45.310 --> 18:47.279
Quickly, get him.
Come on, get him.

18:47.279 --> 18:48.709
- Just get in there.
-Oh, my God.

18:48.709 --> 18:51.613
- Easy, easy.
-Colt, you did it!

18:51.613 --> 18:53.351
Eight and a half rolls!

18:53.351 --> 18:55.551
Come on, you okay? You good?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.356
You good? Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:59.390 --> 19:02.360
Jody's coming. Hold on. Okay.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.790
So good, Dan. Is he good?

19:03.790 --> 19:05.121
- Yeah, of course.
- So good, so good.

19:05.121 --> 19:06.958
Loved it, loved it.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.498
- Incredible.
- Okay.

19:18.543 --> 19:19.676
Whose idea was this?

19:21.172 --> 19:23.249
- I think it was Gail's idea.
- I thought it was your idea.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.350
I-I just found out
about this yesterday.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.077
Dan, come on.

19:27.077 --> 19:29.684
I didn't approve him.
I didn't approve him.

19:29.684 --> 19:31.147
I would never have approved him.

19:31.147 --> 19:32.258
- She didn't approve me.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.358
Can I talk to you for a second?

19:33.358 --> 19:34.524
I'm not approved.

19:34.524 --> 19:36.394
Interesting move. Really.

19:36.394 --> 19:39.397
Really interesting.
Just very casual.

19:39.397 --> 19:43.093
Here you are, you show up,
and, "I'm your new stuntman."

19:54.810 --> 19:58.284
Don't do that.
You can't do that. -What?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.978
- Directing a movie.
- Your hat's coming off.

20:01.718 --> 20:03.355
Why are you here?

20:03.355 --> 20:05.588
I think there's been
a misunderstanding. -Clearly.

20:05.588 --> 20:08.426
Because I was under
the impression that...

20:09.726 --> 20:11.429
...you did want me here.

20:11.429 --> 20:13.189
That's a delusional thought.
We haven't spoken in a year.

20:13.189 --> 20:14.531
- Let's not get into it.
- Gail, Gail-- But Gail told me

20:14.531 --> 20:16.368
- that you wanted me here.
- Okay. Whatever.

20:16.368 --> 20:17.864
I don't even care about it,
but you clipped the camera.

20:17.864 --> 20:20.229
I-I-I'm a little rusty.

20:20.229 --> 20:21.967
- Comic-Con shot ruined.
- I'm sor-- I know.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.134
- Hall H. It's a big deal.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:24.134 --> 20:26.136
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:26.136 --> 20:28.138
I'm happy for you.

20:31.176 --> 20:33.583
This whole director thing
looks good on you.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.080
Even the gardening hat, somehow.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.655
Everyone wears them.
It's like a set thing.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.723
- Okay?
- Yeah, I see it. It's--

20:41.723 --> 20:43.890
They're not making it look
as good as you are, that's all.

20:43.890 --> 20:46.596
And I'm not trying to be fla--
I'm just saying the facts.

20:46.596 --> 20:48.400
But you look good in everything.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.831
You look good in nothing.
Whatever.

20:50.831 --> 20:52.569
- No, I don't mean it like that.
- Really? This isn't...

20:52.569 --> 20:53.966
But you do look good
in nothing. -This isn't work--

20:53.966 --> 20:55.341
- This isn't gonna work.
- I mean, you do.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.310
But it's not what I...

20:59.677 --> 21:01.347
- I'll take anyone. Anyone else.
- Yeah.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.107
- Anyone but him.
-Can I be honest with you?

21:03.107 --> 21:05.384
- Who have you got? Yep.
- We literally have no one else.

21:06.948 --> 21:09.355
- What's next?
-The fire burn.

21:11.183 --> 21:12.919
It's your call.

21:12.919 --> 21:14.690
Okay. -NIGEL: Can we get
a nurse on standby, please?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.461
We're gonna set
this man on fire.

21:34.512 --> 21:36.206
JODY
Cut, cut, cut. -That's a cut.

21:36.206 --> 21:38.483
-Cutting there, please.
-That's a cut!

21:41.719 --> 21:43.356
How you feeling, Colt Seavers?

21:43.356 --> 21:44.687
-He's good.
-He's all good.

21:44.687 --> 21:46.854
We're gonna go again.
Thumbs-up, okay?

21:46.854 --> 21:48.317
Technical issue.
Little bump on the dolly.

21:48.317 --> 21:50.726
- Huh?
- Can you fix that, Jimmy?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.321
- Back to ones, please.
- Thank you.

21:52.321 --> 21:54.191
-Going again.
-Please, back to one.

21:54.191 --> 21:56.127
Colt, do you feel a bit
flung into the deep end here?

21:56.127 --> 21:58.294
I'm just wondering, 'cause
you haven't read the script,

21:58.294 --> 21:59.636
if you'd like some backstory,
some context?

21:59.636 --> 22:01.572
- Would that be good?
- Just go with it.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.233
Yeah, helpful?
Okay. Here we go.

22:03.233 --> 22:06.071
So, sci-fi love story,
two characters,

22:06.071 --> 22:08.304
one of them's an alien--
Aliena--

22:08.304 --> 22:10.042
and you're Space Cowboy.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.978
They shared what's called
a moon season.

22:11.978 --> 22:14.310
In real life,
you might call it a fling.

22:14.310 --> 22:17.148
Um, brief but very intense.

22:17.148 --> 22:19.689
And... hopeful.

22:20.956 --> 22:23.429
Now, neither of them
had ever been in a relationship

22:23.429 --> 22:25.398
that deep before.

22:25.398 --> 22:28.258
And they told each other that
over and over and over again.

22:28.258 --> 22:30.260
Him more than her,
you know, to the point where

22:30.260 --> 22:32.064
sometimes she was like,
"Chill out," you know.

22:32.064 --> 22:34.770
But anyway,
in a tragic turn of events,

22:34.770 --> 22:39.907
Space Cowboy is wounded,
and he just disappears.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.580
Without a trace.

22:48.115 --> 22:49.455
I can keep going.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.787
I can hit the rock
better now, thanks.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.953
We're going again!

22:55.760 --> 22:57.595
Sound speed.

22:57.595 --> 22:59.388
And action!

23:02.600 --> 23:03.898
-That's a cut!

23:03.898 --> 23:05.537
Cutting there, please.

23:08.133 --> 23:09.640
-Everything okay?
-You good?

23:09.640 --> 23:11.873
For a little more
context, Colt,

23:11.873 --> 23:13.644
Aliena's sort of devastated.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.745
And she starts sort of
replaying everything

23:15.745 --> 23:17.109
in her head over and over again.

23:17.109 --> 23:19.210
Did she misread the vibe?

23:19.210 --> 23:20.651
Was it just a fling?

23:20.651 --> 23:23.588
Did she let her imagination
run wild again?

23:23.588 --> 23:25.557
Or did he lie to her?

23:25.557 --> 23:27.625
Was he full of shit?

23:29.596 --> 23:30.958
But let me be clear:

23:30.958 --> 23:32.993
eventually, Aliena did move on.

23:32.993 --> 23:34.929
All right?

23:34.929 --> 23:37.228
And she started doing Pilates.

23:37.228 --> 23:40.803
Got herself
a banging revenge body,

23:40.803 --> 23:43.003
and then she started dating
other humans.

23:43.003 --> 23:45.104
One after another.

23:45.104 --> 23:47.238
And she had
so many mind-blowing,

23:47.238 --> 23:50.439
far superior experiences,
you wouldn't even believe it.

23:50.439 --> 23:51.781
- Right, girls?
- Yeah.

23:51.781 --> 23:53.442
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:53.442 --> 23:54.751
Yeah, it was like a sushi train.

23:54.751 --> 23:57.413
I'm gonna be sick.

23:57.413 --> 23:59.151
And do you know what?
We're gonna go again, Colt,

23:59.151 --> 24:00.988
'cause there was
a little buzz on that one.

24:00.988 --> 24:02.462
Okay, light him up.

24:03.487 --> 24:05.597
Last one, everybody. Action!

24:08.831 --> 24:11.262
It-It's just feeling
so withheld,

24:11.262 --> 24:13.198
so how 'bout some dialogue?

24:13.198 --> 24:14.606
Yeah, that's all right, Darla.

24:14.606 --> 24:16.300
I'm gonna go
straight to the source.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.644
Hey, Colt, if Space Cowboy
had to say something,

24:19.644 --> 24:22.779
if he was forced to say
something, what would he say?

24:22.779 --> 24:24.308
How would he justify

24:24.308 --> 24:26.013
this year she's spent
spinning out over this?

24:26.013 --> 24:27.850
What could he say?
It's a puzzler, isn't it?

24:27.850 --> 24:30.116
- But have you got any thoughts?
- Uh, maybe he could talk...

24:30.116 --> 24:31.557
Nigel, can you, can you
get him a bullhorn?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.449
I can't hear him.

24:33.449 --> 24:34.659
Traveling.

24:43.734 --> 24:45.329
Come again, Colt.
What was that?

24:45.329 --> 24:47.573
- It's already on.
-  In this movie,

24:47.573 --> 24:51.302
do the aliens and the humans
ever talk...

24:51.302 --> 24:52.743
in private?

24:53.845 --> 24:55.746
- No, not really.
- No private conversations?

24:55.746 --> 24:57.308
No, they don't like
doing private.

24:57.308 --> 24:58.650
Like, they like
to keep it very public.

24:58.650 --> 25:00.344
- Very open.
- Oh.

25:02.348 --> 25:06.757
Well, maybe I'll just, uh,
open it up to the group here.

25:06.757 --> 25:10.420
Have you ever been in one of
those situations where...

25:11.698 --> 25:13.665
...you want to say something
and it's so important

25:13.665 --> 25:15.392
that you can't mess it up?

25:15.392 --> 25:20.397
So, you think
long and hard about it,

25:20.397 --> 25:22.839
and then you realize...

25:22.839 --> 25:24.676
you've already messed it up?

25:24.676 --> 25:29.373
'Cause you've thought
too long and too hard about it?

25:30.783 --> 25:32.442
You're...

25:32.442 --> 25:33.949
What's that?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.216
- You want...

25:41.627 --> 25:43.222
I had a similar situation

25:43.222 --> 25:45.455
when I fell in love
with my wife's sister.

25:45.455 --> 25:46.929
- Okay. All right. What...
- No.

25:46.929 --> 25:49.261
- No. Okay.

25:49.261 --> 25:51.263
Uh...

25:51.263 --> 25:53.771
And again,
this is hard because...

25:53.771 --> 25:55.641
you know, I haven't
read the script.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.137
But...

25:59.205 --> 26:01.273
...he'd probably say...

26:02.914 --> 26:04.980
...that he's been living...

26:07.281 --> 26:09.655
...in total regret since then.

26:11.087 --> 26:12.790
You know, afraid...

26:12.790 --> 26:14.726
that he'll never get
an opportunity

26:14.726 --> 26:16.453
to make it up to her...

26:18.028 --> 26:19.555
...because he waited too long.

26:19.555 --> 26:21.161
And...

26:23.935 --> 26:25.803
...she's probably moved on.

26:25.803 --> 26:27.299
Uh, sorry, Jody,

26:27.299 --> 26:29.939
speaking of moving on,
we, uh...

26:31.844 --> 26:33.811
One more?

26:38.609 --> 26:40.653
I'd love another chance.

26:44.219 --> 26:46.186
- Roll it, Nigel.
- Let's turn over, please!

26:46.186 --> 26:48.023
- All cameras are rolling.
- Shot's up, sound speeding.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.222
Okay, light him up!

26:52.029 --> 26:53.292
Action! Thank you!

27:00.741 --> 27:02.301
Gail?

27:04.041 --> 27:05.942
Gail?

27:05.942 --> 27:08.109
Oh. Coffee.

27:16.581 --> 27:18.515
Mm! You're here.

27:18.515 --> 27:19.857
Oh, no, don't use that.
It's broken.

27:19.857 --> 27:22.453
Eight and a half rolls?

27:22.453 --> 27:25.456
That is a world record!

27:25.456 --> 27:28.393
Thank you so much.

27:28.393 --> 27:31.066
It's better than parking cars,
isn't it?

27:32.628 --> 27:34.564
- Would you cut the shit, Gail?

27:34.564 --> 27:36.709
What? It was amazing.
What are you talking about?

27:36.709 --> 27:39.008
She doesn't want me here, Gail.

27:39.008 --> 27:40.372
Yes, she does.

27:40.372 --> 27:41.978
Oh, of course she does.

27:41.978 --> 27:44.816
- You lied. You lied.
- Oh.

27:44.816 --> 27:46.752
- Colt.
- Do you know how that feels?

27:46.752 --> 27:48.721
I think you deserve
a second chance.

27:48.721 --> 27:52.549
It's, like, the message
in all my movies.

27:52.549 --> 27:54.188
What's the message
in all my movies?

27:54.188 --> 27:56.520
Uh...

27:56.520 --> 27:58.797
Nihilism's a viable worldview?

28:00.427 --> 28:03.065
No, that's just
the entertainment.

28:03.065 --> 28:05.067
That's like the...

28:05.067 --> 28:06.937
like the sexy bacon.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.840
- What is this?
- You know? It's like dogs.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.700
You got to wrap the message...

28:11.700 --> 28:13.636
in some sexy bacon.

28:14.881 --> 28:17.343
I mean, all those movies,
people fall down.

28:17.343 --> 28:19.279
They're rolling
in their own shit.

28:19.279 --> 28:21.512
They don't think they can cope,
but they can. They get back up.

28:21.512 --> 28:23.349
Do you mind if I lay down?

28:23.349 --> 28:26.187
With the multiple fire burns
and the cannon rolls

28:26.187 --> 28:28.794
- and the jet lag, I just...
- Yep, yep, yep.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.290
...could use a little shut-eye.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.423
Yep.

28:31.423 --> 28:33.062
Okay, let me get this straight.

28:34.263 --> 28:37.231
- Nihilism is the sexy bacon?
- Yeah.

28:37.231 --> 28:39.035
The audience are dogs?

28:39.035 --> 28:40.432
There we go.

28:40.432 --> 28:43.600
And when you fall down,
you get back up.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.470
- Thank you.
- I'm glad we did this.

28:45.470 --> 28:48.605
Now, what am I
really doing here, Gail?

28:50.642 --> 28:52.477
Um...

28:52.477 --> 28:53.577
Ryder's missing.

28:53.577 --> 28:55.117
He has fallen in

28:55.117 --> 28:58.318
with some shady,
shitty, shitty people.

28:58.318 --> 29:00.518
Well, Gail...

29:01.752 --> 29:03.125
...call the cops.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.489
I can't call the cops.

29:04.489 --> 29:06.062
Well, why not?

29:06.062 --> 29:08.757
The studio will know
that I am way over budget.

29:08.757 --> 29:10.429
They will pull the plug on this.

29:10.429 --> 29:12.937
You know that.

29:12.937 --> 29:14.235
Please go and find him.

29:14.235 --> 29:15.566
Why me?

29:15.566 --> 29:17.601
You're a stuntman,
for God's sake.

29:17.601 --> 29:19.768
No one's gonna notice
whether you're here or not.

29:19.768 --> 29:21.638
- No offense.
- I mean, some taken.

29:21.638 --> 29:24.410
You know him intimately.

29:24.410 --> 29:26.115
It can be so simple.

29:26.115 --> 29:28.953
You pick him up,
you dust him off,

29:28.953 --> 29:30.251
you bring him back here.

29:30.251 --> 29:31.857
I know I can trust you.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.518
And you know who can
trust you more than anyone,

29:33.518 --> 29:36.422
she just doesn't
realize it yet, is Jody.

29:36.422 --> 29:39.359
This is her big chance.

29:39.359 --> 29:42.164
Do you want her first movie
to be her last?

29:42.164 --> 29:44.496
You've got to help me out, man.

29:45.906 --> 29:48.500
It's been a long couple days.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.470
I'm gonna go to the hotel,
I'm gonna--

29:51.470 --> 29:54.209
What is it? It's my yesterday,
it's your tomor--

29:54.209 --> 29:55.639
I'm gonna call you
your tomorrow.

29:55.639 --> 29:57.377
- Right, no. Today.
- My today.

29:57.377 --> 29:59.016
That is the door code
of Ryder's loft.

29:59.016 --> 30:00.952
The patio door.
Took it from his trailer.

30:00.952 --> 30:02.954
He's still doing
this Post-it note thing?

30:02.954 --> 30:05.022
Oh.
Let's not even get into that.

30:05.022 --> 30:07.783
At this point,
it's like <i>Memento</i> level.

30:07.783 --> 30:10.324
I can only keep this
from Jody and the studio

30:10.324 --> 30:12.557
48 hours max.

30:12.557 --> 30:14.130
Save Jody's movie,

30:14.130 --> 30:16.660
and maybe you get
the love of your life back.

30:18.268 --> 30:20.829
Did you just turn Jody
into the sexy bacon?

30:20.829 --> 30:23.975
She's been
the sexy bacon all along.

30:23.975 --> 30:25.372
You're good.

30:25.372 --> 30:27.605
It's the only left-hand drive
I have.

30:29.378 --> 30:31.543
Please don't wreck it.
It's product placement.

30:31.543 --> 30:34.051
There's only two of them.

30:34.051 --> 30:36.284
I know how you stunties drive.

30:39.388 --> 30:42.092

32:17.649 --> 32:19.519
Were you "chilling down"
to Taylor Swift?

32:19.519 --> 32:21.488
- Yep.
- Mm.

32:21.488 --> 32:23.325
It's just something
Australians say.

32:23.325 --> 32:24.755
Really? I've been here for six
months, I've never heard it.

32:24.755 --> 32:26.196
Yeah, "chilling down under,"
you know,

32:26.196 --> 32:27.527
but it's shorter to say
"chilling down."

32:27.527 --> 32:29.694
- Have you been crying?
- Not at all.

32:29.694 --> 32:31.234
You look like
you've been crying.

32:32.831 --> 32:34.699
Jet lag.

32:34.699 --> 32:37.636
That was so dangerous,
and I'm very sorry.

32:37.636 --> 32:39.704
Lighting you up like that.

32:39.704 --> 32:42.113
It was very cathartic.

32:42.113 --> 32:44.247
- I feel better.
- I deserved it.

32:46.647 --> 32:49.813
I'm gonna make the camera
up to you, by the way.

32:49.813 --> 32:52.057
Can I get in the car with you?

32:54.259 --> 32:56.490
Clean your face. You're a mess.

32:59.825 --> 33:01.231
So how have you been?

33:01.231 --> 33:03.662
Oh, you know.

33:05.336 --> 33:06.830
Yeah? Thumbs-up?

33:06.830 --> 33:09.701
God, I hate that bullshit,
that stunt guy bullshit.

33:11.111 --> 33:12.308
- And that's fine.

33:12.308 --> 33:13.672
You don't have to
explain anything.

33:13.672 --> 33:15.476
It's all good. It was a fling.

33:15.476 --> 33:17.577
Less than a fling. It was
a flingette, and that's fine.

33:17.577 --> 33:19.381
I don't even want to know.

33:19.381 --> 33:21.845
And the problem with forcing
something is you get nowhere.

33:21.845 --> 33:23.682
You know, one time my mom
forced my dad to exercise.

33:23.682 --> 33:25.486
Do you know what happened?

33:25.486 --> 33:27.389
Snapped his ankle first time
he stepped on the treadmill.

33:27.389 --> 33:29.985
She forced it, now he has
a piece of metal in his foot.

33:29.985 --> 33:32.196
Moral of the story is
you should just be you.

33:34.959 --> 33:36.926
Well, look, I've thought
a lot about this, actually,

33:36.926 --> 33:38.400
and I, uh...

33:38.400 --> 33:39.698
It's not like
I didn't want to apologize

33:39.698 --> 33:41.700
a million times.

33:41.700 --> 33:42.866
Yeah.

33:42.866 --> 33:45.407
Uh, it's just, every time I...

33:49.039 --> 33:51.710
You know, when I think of
something to say...

33:54.550 --> 33:56.616
...doesn't seem like enough.

34:01.887 --> 34:03.524
Okay.

34:03.524 --> 34:05.361
No problem.

34:05.361 --> 34:08.298
Boundaries. Boundaries.

34:08.298 --> 34:09.629
That's important.

34:09.629 --> 34:11.433
Because I have
a lot of pressure on me.

34:11.433 --> 34:15.305
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to make this movie, okay?

34:15.305 --> 34:17.406
I just need to focus,
so if you're gonna stay here,

34:17.406 --> 34:19.705
we need to keep it...

34:19.705 --> 34:21.179

34:22.248 --> 34:23.577

is my middle name.

34:23.577 --> 34:25.513
Mm-hmm.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.044
I thought your middle name
was "Danger."

Where do I know you from?

38:38.733 --> 38:41.637
I'm Iggy Starr,
lead actress on <i>Metalstorm.</i>

38:43.837 --> 38:45.234
- I'm Ryder's girlfriend.
- Oh.

38:45.234 --> 38:46.741
- You're in <i>Metalstorm.</i>
- Yeah.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.204
Hey, were you
in that movie <i>Carjacked</i>

38:48.204 --> 38:49.678
where that guy named Jack
steals your car

38:49.678 --> 38:51.009
and then you shoot him
in the hand and you say,

38:51.009 --> 38:52.384
"I hope you know
how to drive stick"?

38:52.384 --> 38:54.078
And it doesn't make sense
'cause it's like,

38:54.078 --> 38:55.849
should be "automatic,"
but the way you say it...

38:55.849 --> 38:57.356
That's Naomi Watts!

39:03.021 --> 39:04.220
I'm just a stunt guy.

39:04.220 --> 39:06.222
I'm working on <i>Metalstorm,</i> too.

39:06.222 --> 39:09.225
You lie!
We're only on <i>Metalstorm 1.</i>

39:09.225 --> 39:11.062
- I meant also!

39:29.212 --> 39:30.752
Is this a prop sword?

39:30.752 --> 39:33.458
Mm-hmm. I'm a good actress.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.626
Hey, if you are
really working on <i>Metalstorm,</i>

39:36.626 --> 39:38.122
why are you
sneaking around here?

39:38.122 --> 39:40.058
Just trying to find Ryder.

39:40.058 --> 39:42.533
He's, like, really drugged up
and paranoid right now.

39:42.533 --> 39:44.359
He thinks someone's
trying to kill him.

39:44.359 --> 39:47.263
And I'm like, "If you don't
finish <i>Metalstorm,</i>

39:47.263 --> 39:49.771
I'm gonna kill you myself."

39:49.771 --> 39:51.971
Now, there is
some dark shit going on.

39:51.971 --> 39:54.303
And the sooner I can get
out of here, the better.

39:55.845 --> 39:57.779
Wow.

39:57.779 --> 39:59.649
Any idea where I could find him?

39:59.649 --> 40:02.487
Uh, you could try this club
he hangs out at.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.281
But you're never gonna get in
looking like a povo.

40:05.281 --> 40:07.954
- What's a povo?
- A poor person like you.

40:07.954 --> 40:09.989
Oh. Cool.

40:09.989 --> 40:13.157
What's with your

40:13.157 --> 40:14.796
Oh, it was
the first show I ever did.

40:14.796 --> 40:18.228
I had to jump a boat
through a ring of fire.

40:18.228 --> 40:19.636
I got so good I could do it

40:19.636 --> 40:20.934

tied behind my back.

40:22.432 --> 40:23.607

don't you?

40:41.416 --> 40:43.253

41:09.114 --> 41:11.446
Uh, honestly, no offense,
Mr. Doone.

41:11.446 --> 41:13.316
I just want to find Ryder.

41:13.316 --> 41:16.253
How come no one ever wants
to chat with the drug dealer?

41:19.423 --> 41:21.962
Sorry. I, uh...

41:21.962 --> 41:24.492
I mean no... no disrespect.

41:24.492 --> 41:26.494
Just had a long day.
Ryder hasn't shown up to work.

41:26.494 --> 41:28.166
That was fast.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.640
You do a stunt today?

41:29.640 --> 41:31.235
Uh, just a, yeah, car roll.

41:31.235 --> 41:32.742
- Just a car roll?

41:32.742 --> 41:35.008
Hear how he said that?
"Just a car roll!"

41:35.008 --> 41:36.911
What a stuntman! My man!

41:36.911 --> 41:38.682
It's what I do.

41:38.682 --> 41:39.848
Hey, that's why I like you.

41:39.848 --> 41:41.410
'Cause you do all the hard shit.

41:41.410 --> 41:44.017
They give Oscars for that?

41:44.017 --> 41:45.920
For stunts?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.724
No.

41:47.724 --> 41:49.154
Nope.

41:49.154 --> 41:51.321
Hey, to the unsung heroes.

41:51.321 --> 41:53.125
- I'll drink to that.
-  Yeah.

41:55.228 --> 41:56.997
Mm!

41:58.361 --> 42:00.033
No offense,
but I prefer cartoons.

42:00.033 --> 42:02.871
See, movies are always trying
to make things real.

42:02.871 --> 42:04.675
But it's not real.
It's a movie.

42:04.675 --> 42:06.534
It's not meant to be real.

42:06.534 --> 42:08.272
- That's why I like cartoons.

42:08.272 --> 42:09.537
See, 'cause cartoons

42:09.537 --> 42:10.780
don't pretend to be real.

42:12.441 --> 42:14.410
That's what I like about them.
You seen <i>Dumbo?</i>

42:14.410 --> 42:15.950
<i>- Dumbo?</i>
- Yeah, <i>Dumbo.</i>

42:15.950 --> 42:17.853
<i>Dumbo</i> changed my life.

42:17.853 --> 42:20.086
You know that scene when Dumbo
gets into the bad champagne,

42:20.086 --> 42:21.417
then he starts seeing
the pink elephants

42:21.417 --> 42:22.418
on parade and shit?

42:22.418 --> 42:23.628
I was like, "Yes, please.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.091
"I'll have what he's having!

42:25.091 --> 42:26.521
Make it a double!"

42:27.731 --> 42:29.601
Hey, stuntman?

42:29.601 --> 42:31.295
- Why don't you come with us?

42:31.295 --> 42:33.737
We'll get you nice and
comfortable at the hotel, huh?

43:19.213 --> 43:22.214
Move, move! Get out of the way!
Get-- Move! Come on!

43:23.547 --> 43:26.251
Get out the way!
Move! Get off me!

43:26.251 --> 43:27.516
Hey!

43:31.962 --> 43:33.423
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Taxi! Come on, come on.

43:33.423 --> 43:34.831
Come on, brother, let's go.

43:34.831 --> 43:37.163
- Go! -See you, mate.
- Be well, mate.

43:47.307 --> 43:48.977
What are you doing, Colt?

43:48.977 --> 43:51.474
You know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna stop this car.

43:51.474 --> 43:54.279
You're clearly high, Colt.
And you're clearly chickenshit!

43:54.279 --> 43:56.347
Okay, we don't have time for
this. Talk about this later.

44:05.290 --> 44:06.995
Yeah, okay. -DOONE:
Driver, what are you doing?

44:06.995 --> 44:09.294
Drive! Drive, bro!

44:09.294 --> 44:11.164
Listen. Hey, you need to chill.
Just relax. Just re--

44:11.164 --> 44:12.968
Hey, just relax! I'm a lover,
not a fighter, okay? Just...

44:12.968 --> 44:14.200
- Where's Ryder?!
- I just drugged you

44:14.200 --> 44:15.333
'cause they paid me to.

44:15.333 --> 44:16.807
- Who's "they"?

44:16.807 --> 44:18.468
The guy that runs
Ryder's security.

44:18.468 --> 44:19.744
I deliver drugs to him

44:19.744 --> 44:21.240
at the Pendleton Hotel
sometimes, okay?

44:21.240 --> 44:22.175
- What room?
- Bro, I don't know what room.

44:22.175 --> 44:23.715
You know, it changes.

44:23.715 --> 44:24.914
Just ask Kevin
for the, for the fruit plate.

44:24.914 --> 44:26.476
- He'll give you the key.
- Kevin?

44:26.476 --> 44:27.917
- Kevin! K-E-V-I-N. For the...
- I know Kevin!

44:27.917 --> 44:28.984
You know Kevin?

44:28.984 --> 44:30.480
I don't know Kevin.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.086
Well, then you're gonna
get to know Kevin.

44:32.086 --> 44:35.188
Ask him for a fruit plate,
and he'll give you keys.

44:35.188 --> 44:36.651
How long does this last?

44:36.651 --> 44:38.191
- What?
- How long is this gonna last?

44:38.191 --> 44:39.324
Bro, what are you even saying?

44:39.324 --> 44:42.261
How... long does this last?

44:42.261 --> 44:45.099
Oh. When you stop
seeing unicorns.

44:49.565 --> 44:52.238
I'd like to speak to Kevin.

44:52.238 --> 44:54.504
Kevin's, uh, on a break.

44:54.504 --> 44:57.914
Okay, maybe you can help me.
Can I order the "fruit plate"?

44:57.914 --> 45:01.786
Okay. Do you want me
to call "room service"?

45:01.786 --> 45:03.678
I don't know.
Is that what happens?

45:03.678 --> 45:04.888
D-Do you have a room?

45:04.888 --> 45:06.384
- Should I just...
- Do I need one?

45:06.384 --> 45:07.682
To order the fr...

45:07.682 --> 45:08.793
- I...
- The fruit plate.

45:08.793 --> 45:09.827
- Hey, Colt.
- Fruit plate.

45:10.830 --> 45:11.895
Woof, wow.

45:11.895 --> 45:13.963
- That's a look.
- Hi. Hey.

45:13.963 --> 45:15.294
- What happened to your face?
- Hi.

45:15.294 --> 45:16.867
- Hi. Okay.

45:16.867 --> 45:18.363
- Sorry about that.
- Are you good?

45:18.363 --> 45:19.870
- It's just good...
- What's wrong with you?

45:19.870 --> 45:20.772
- It's good to see you.
- Wow, you look terrible.

45:20.772 --> 45:22.103
You look amazing.

45:22.103 --> 45:23.566
Did you fall?
What happened to you?

45:23.566 --> 45:25.271
Wow. You're so pretty.

45:25.271 --> 45:26.635
-  It's crazy.
- Okay. Your face is bleeding.

45:26.635 --> 45:28.604
- What?
- What happened to you?

45:28.604 --> 45:30.639
Oh. No, I was running.
Just-- I was running.

45:30.639 --> 45:32.949
Very unusual athleisure wear
for a run.

45:32.949 --> 45:34.577
-  This?
- Yeah.

45:34.577 --> 45:37.118
Yeah, they gave me
the wrong bags at the airport,

45:37.118 --> 45:38.449
but, you know, it's-- it works.

45:38.449 --> 45:39.956
I can sweat.

45:39.956 --> 45:41.452
If I'm gonna play Ryder,
I thought I should just,

45:41.452 --> 45:42.794
like, cut weight a little,
you know...

45:42.794 --> 45:43.960
You seem kind of tweaky.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.556
I'm a little... spotty.

45:46.556 --> 45:49.229
Like, when I--
my glucose levels get low.

45:49.229 --> 45:50.901
I get a little...

45:50.901 --> 45:53.761
- Okay, is that a new thing?

45:53.761 --> 45:55.301
Is that a new thing?

45:55.301 --> 45:56.599
- What's that?
- Is that a new thing?

45:56.599 --> 45:58.271
- Is your hair new?
- Yes, I cut it.

45:58.271 --> 45:59.635
- I changed my hair.
- It's beautiful.

45:59.635 --> 46:01.142
You changed your number.
We're even.

46:01.142 --> 46:03.507
I thought we'd sort of
even the score.

46:03.507 --> 46:05.410
Yeah. I have a lot of new s--

46:05.410 --> 46:06.950
You know, I've learned
a lot about myself

46:06.950 --> 46:09.117
since-since we last
seen each other.

46:09.117 --> 46:10.855
Why'd you disappear like that?

46:10.855 --> 46:13.055
God, I wanted
to be there for you.

46:14.553 --> 46:16.652
Yeah, but how's
she supposed to do quality work

46:16.652 --> 46:18.093
if you keep harassing her
all the time?

46:20.425 --> 46:22.493
Okay. Can you go
and grab your things?

46:22.493 --> 46:24.836
- We have really got to zip.
- Okay. Yep.

46:24.836 --> 46:26.200
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.005
- Colt, you're...

46:29.005 --> 46:30.369
You look like you've been busy.

46:30.369 --> 46:32.635
- Yeah, real busy, Gail.
- Yeah, good.

46:32.635 --> 46:33.845
Lot of running around, Gail.

46:33.845 --> 46:35.770
We'll get a drink
and discuss that.

46:35.770 --> 46:37.310
But right now, the studio...

46:37.310 --> 46:39.543
so far up my ass,
I can taste them.

46:39.543 --> 46:41.116
- We need your third act.
- Okay. Yep.

46:41.116 --> 46:42.711
You having problems
with the third act?

46:42.711 --> 46:44.449
We're gonna, we're gonna go
and do things right now.

46:44.449 --> 46:45.857
I need to write it.
I'm gonna go write it. I just--

46:45.857 --> 46:47.551
It's like
the studio are wanting me

46:47.551 --> 46:49.960
to contort the love story
so that it all ends happily

46:49.960 --> 46:51.357
and everything's rosy and...

46:51.357 --> 46:52.897
- Jody, Jody, Jody.
- But I feel like if I...

46:52.897 --> 46:56.296
lean into reality,
then maybe that's the way to go.

46:56.296 --> 46:59.068
And most love stories
don't end well. Usually.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.731
- Know what I mean?
- I strongly disagree with that,

47:02.731 --> 47:05.503
so we should keep
chopping it up.

47:05.503 --> 47:06.735
Yeah? Should we?

47:06.735 --> 47:08.913
It's important.
It's the ending.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.574
- Okay.

47:12.378 --> 47:14.083
Sir?

47:14.083 --> 47:15.414
- Huh?
- Hi.

47:15.414 --> 47:16.679
- Yeah.
- Hi.

47:16.679 --> 47:18.681
Um, I hear that
you're interested

47:18.681 --> 47:20.518
in a-a fruit platter.

47:20.518 --> 47:21.992
-  Kevin?
-  Yes.

47:21.992 --> 47:23.389
Yes. Okay, so...

47:24.489 --> 47:26.898
It's-it's on... it's on ice.

47:47.413 --> 47:49.745
Yep. There we go. Sorry.

48:35.166 --> 48:36.825
Hello?

48:36.825 --> 48:38.332
What do you
think about split screen?

48:38.332 --> 48:40.400
- Jody?
- Yeah.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.765
Is this okay I'm calling?
You said to call and...

48:42.765 --> 48:45.174
- Yes. Yeah, it's fine.
- Yeah? We could chop it up?

48:45.174 --> 48:47.242
It's, uh... Let's chop it up.

48:47.242 --> 48:48.639
It's a good time.
I'm not doing anything.

48:48.639 --> 48:51.774
Okay. Great.
Uh, so, split screen, right?

48:51.774 --> 48:53.908
Do you think that it's,
like, nostalgic super cool

48:53.908 --> 48:56.482
or do you think
it's a gimmick? -

48:56.482 --> 48:59.287
Um, I think
it could be super cool.

48:59.287 --> 49:02.092
Mm-hmm? -Yeah, how do you,
uh, want to use it?

49:02.092 --> 49:04.490
I mean, you know, tell me.
Tell me everything.

49:04.490 --> 49:06.756
Tell me, you know,
about your vision.

49:06.756 --> 49:08.692
So, I like that
they're on-screen together.

49:08.692 --> 49:10.430
But they are in
separate worlds... -Right.

49:10.430 --> 49:12.531
...you know,
visually and emotionally.

49:12.531 --> 49:14.764
So you've got
this very prominent divide

49:14.764 --> 49:16.205
between the lovers.

49:16.205 --> 49:17.668
And I want that.

49:20.805 --> 49:23.410
- You want the divide?
- I want the divide, yes.

49:26.085 --> 49:27.711
Hmm.

49:27.711 --> 49:29.350
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't
get the impression

49:29.350 --> 49:31.385
that there was that much
keeping them apart.

49:31.385 --> 49:33.486
Well, you haven't
read the script.

49:34.984 --> 49:37.193
All I know so far is that
the alien lady and the cowboy

49:37.193 --> 49:41.494
are having what seem to be
pretty manageable problems.

49:41.494 --> 49:44.299
Jody? Jod-- How's this?

49:44.299 --> 49:45.894
Manageable problems?

49:45.894 --> 49:47.995
The aliens invaded Earth,
and they left it in tatters.

49:47.995 --> 49:49.667
So this whole thing
the studio are pushing for,

49:49.667 --> 49:51.075
the "love conquers all"
thing...

49:51.075 --> 49:53.704
I'm not buying it.

49:53.704 --> 49:56.971
Well, I have to admit that I'm
surprised to hear you say that.

49:56.971 --> 49:58.808
Why?

49:58.808 --> 50:01.250
Well, I'm just
a boy in a neon suit

50:01.250 --> 50:03.219
standing in front of a girl,
reminding her

50:03.219 --> 50:05.584
that <i>Notting Hill</i>
is her favorite movie

50:05.584 --> 50:08.818
and she watches <i>Love Actually</i>
every year at Christmas.

50:08.818 --> 50:10.556
Well, you know,
I watched it again this year,

50:10.556 --> 50:13.262
and I didn't love it, actually.

50:13.262 --> 50:15.099
- Wow, it's worse than I thought.
- Yeah, I'm ruined.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.266
Yeah, it's a really sad day
for <i>Notting Hill</i> as well.

50:17.266 --> 50:19.433
That "happily ever after"
stuff, unsubscribe me.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.105
I didn't get "happily ever
after" from <i>Notting Hill.</i>

50:21.105 --> 50:22.568
What are you talking about?
Of course you did.

50:22.568 --> 50:24.405
- Did you?
- Yes, of course. They're ly--

50:24.405 --> 50:26.209
They're on the park bench.
She's got her head in his knee.

50:26.209 --> 50:27.408
She's a "regular girl."

50:27.408 --> 50:28.937
Maybe, but we don't know
for sure

50:28.937 --> 50:31.412
she's not gonna go back
to working the street.

50:31.412 --> 50:32.941
All we know is that
in the beginning,

50:32.941 --> 50:34.778
she's pretty much up for
anything but kissing,

50:34.778 --> 50:36.417
and in the end,
she's open to kissing him.

50:36.417 --> 50:38.518
-  No. No.
- And it gives us hope.

50:38.518 --> 50:40.014
You have got your Julia Roberts
movies so twisted.

50:40.014 --> 50:41.257
And that's all we want.
A little hope.

50:41.257 --> 50:42.588
No, that is <i>Pretty Woman,</i>

50:42.588 --> 50:43.853
where she is
a lady of the night,

50:43.853 --> 50:45.195
and this is <i>Notting Hill,</i>

50:45.195 --> 50:46.262
where she's
a very famous actress.

50:46.262 --> 50:47.758
Oh. Well, don't listen to me.

50:47.758 --> 50:49.892
What do I know?
Look, you're the director.

50:49.892 --> 50:51.234
You're gonna make
the right choice.

50:51.234 --> 50:53.137
I'm just saying,
for people like me,

50:53.137 --> 50:54.963
who may not necessarily get the
metaphor of the split screen.

50:54.963 --> 50:56.734
You may not get
the deeper metaphor,

50:56.734 --> 50:58.241
but you're gonna see it.

50:58.241 --> 50:59.935
You're gonna see
this bright line between them

50:59.935 --> 51:02.905
that we're gonna ache
to see blur.

51:02.905 --> 51:04.709
You know, but maybe it can't.

51:04.709 --> 51:07.041
- Mm.
- Maybe it doesn't.

51:07.041 --> 51:09.780
Right. Right. Yeah.

51:11.551 --> 51:13.619
But what do we know, right?

51:13.619 --> 51:15.258
'Cause all we know at this point

51:15.258 --> 51:17.953
is that the cowboy
likes the alien.

51:17.953 --> 51:19.394
Does the alien like the cowboy?

51:19.394 --> 51:21.297
She's on the fence.

51:21.297 --> 51:22.562
Right.

51:22.562 --> 51:24.597
Because they got problems.

51:24.597 --> 51:29.140
Because she's an alien and he's
a cowboy, and that's a problem.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.768
But is it a problem
they can't overcome?

51:30.768 --> 51:32.407
Here's a question.

51:32.407 --> 51:35.245
Are they even gonna try?

51:35.245 --> 51:36.774
What do you think?

51:38.008 --> 51:40.041
Do you think they're gonna try?

51:41.451 --> 51:43.814
I think...

51:45.290 --> 51:47.356
I think this was
a great brainstorm.

51:50.823 --> 51:53.263
So...

51:53.263 --> 51:55.793
what'd you decide
about the split screen?

51:55.793 --> 51:57.630
I have a better idea.

51:59.093 --> 52:00.930
I don't think you need it.

52:00.930 --> 52:03.471
I think the connection between
these characters is so strong

52:03.471 --> 52:05.572
that nothing can
come between them.

52:06.971 --> 52:08.509
Jod?

52:09.875 --> 52:11.039
Jody?

52:34.735 --> 52:36.900
-Hello?
- Dead guy on ice.

52:36.900 --> 52:38.539
What?

52:38.539 --> 52:42.213
There's a dead guy on ice
at the hotel, Gail.

52:42.213 --> 52:44.039
Wait. Sorry.
What are you talking about?

52:44.039 --> 52:45.381
Well, if you think
that doesn't make sense,

52:45.381 --> 52:47.317
- don't order the fruit plate.
- Hold on.

52:47.317 --> 52:49.143
You're seriously telling me
you've just seen a dead body?

52:49.143 --> 52:50.848
Yes, Gail.

52:50.848 --> 52:53.422
On the rocks. In the hotel.

52:53.422 --> 52:54.687
What hotel?

52:54.687 --> 52:56.656
The one
I just saw you in, Gail!

52:56.656 --> 52:58.229
He was so dead, Gail.

52:58.229 --> 53:00.330
He was very dead. Super dead.

53:00.330 --> 53:01.760
Hold on.
How did you even get there?

53:01.760 --> 53:04.158
Gail, you asked me
to do this! Okay?

53:04.158 --> 53:06.699
- So please try and keep up.
- I know. I'm sticking.

53:06.699 --> 53:09.339
I went to Ryder's apartment
just like you told me.

53:09.339 --> 53:11.737
That's where Iggy with
the sword gave me the neon suit

53:11.737 --> 53:14.377
and they sent me to the man
with the leopard print head.

53:14.377 --> 53:16.280
He goes by the name of Doone.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.172
It was Doone's goons
who dirtied my Shirley,

53:18.172 --> 53:19.943
and not in a fun way, Gail.

53:19.943 --> 53:22.209
I think they were
trying to kill me, Gail!

53:22.209 --> 53:24.387
Step away and calm down.

53:24.387 --> 53:26.048
I am gonna handle everything.

53:26.048 --> 53:27.522
- No more handling!

53:27.522 --> 53:29.392
- I want the police!
- You're very aggressive.

53:29.392 --> 53:31.757
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell.
I want the police.

53:31.757 --> 53:33.462
You are not gonna talk
to the police.

53:33.462 --> 53:34.925
You don't talk to anyone
about this, okay? -

53:34.925 --> 53:36.223
- You listen to me.
- I'm calling the police.

53:36.223 --> 53:37.598
You are not
talking to the police.

53:37.598 --> 53:39.094
- Excuse me, sir.
-Wait, who's there?

53:39.094 --> 53:40.436
Who's there? Who's there?

53:40.436 --> 53:41.767
It's the police.
I'm gonna talk to them.

53:41.767 --> 53:42.999
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't talk...

53:45.135 --> 53:47.971
No parking at any time.

53:51.944 --> 53:54.109
Sorry.

53:54.109 --> 53:55.484
Just making sure
we're both here.

53:56.454 --> 53:57.552
I'm-I'm here, mate.

53:57.552 --> 53:59.455
I want to report a crime.

53:59.455 --> 54:01.083
- Okay.
- An ice crime.

54:07.221 --> 54:09.894
Yeah. You're still
getting a ticket, mate.

54:09.894 --> 54:11.269
All right.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.230
<i>I got to tell Jody.</i>

54:16.230 --> 54:17.572
About the dead guy.

54:17.572 --> 54:18.837
How do you know he was dead?

54:18.837 --> 54:20.267
He could've just been
knocked out.

54:20.267 --> 54:21.675
- On ice?
- Yeah.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.777
Ice baths are very good
for inflammation.

54:24.777 --> 54:27.109
And are you forgetting
that you were high?

54:27.109 --> 54:28.781
How can I if you keep fixating

54:28.781 --> 54:30.112
- on that one point?
- Okay, you know what,

54:30.112 --> 54:31.685
let me just stop you
right there.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.489
Whatever you told Jody
last night

54:33.489 --> 54:34.952
- has got her all fired up.
- I don't know what I said.

54:34.952 --> 54:36.360
About what?

54:36.360 --> 54:37.625
And now I have to build a truck

54:37.625 --> 54:39.990
- for a 250-foot jump.
- Huh?

54:39.990 --> 54:41.926
- In a day and a half!
- Sounds pretty cool, actually.

54:41.926 --> 54:44.159
And on top of that,
the fight scene today,

54:44.159 --> 54:46.865
Jody has decided that she wants
to do it all in one take.

54:46.865 --> 54:49.131
A oner. -JODY: Dan, did you
tell him about the oner?

54:49.131 --> 54:50.440
- Yes.
- So cool.

54:50.440 --> 54:51.639
- Right?
- Yeah.

54:51.639 --> 54:53.300
- So good. He's into it.
- Hi.

54:53.300 --> 54:54.972
Hey. Yeah, can I talk to you
for a second? -Okay,

54:54.972 --> 54:57.612
about this sequence today,
Ryder's a no-show. -Yeah.

54:57.612 --> 54:59.009
Again, he's probably on
a bender or something.

54:59.009 --> 55:00.109
Well, it's interesting
you say that,

55:00.109 --> 55:01.847
- because that's...
- Yeah.

55:01.847 --> 55:03.783
...that's what I want to talk
to you about. -Me, too.

55:03.783 --> 55:05.620
Me, too. Because we don't even
need him. -He...

55:05.620 --> 55:07.149
Well... -We don't need him.
I had an epiphany last night.

55:07.149 --> 55:08.392
Let me just tell you.

55:08.392 --> 55:09.987
- Last night?
- I was so excited.

55:09.987 --> 55:12.396
Yeah. -After we spoke,
it all came to me.

55:12.396 --> 55:14.222
Really? -Yeah,
the third act, this sequence,

55:14.222 --> 55:16.158
- all of it. I've been s...
- After talking to me?

55:16.158 --> 55:17.566
Yeah. You know, I was shocked

55:17.566 --> 55:19.062
- when you showed up. Right?
- Yeah.

55:19.062 --> 55:21.570
- But...
- Well, it was... shocking.

55:21.570 --> 55:23.506
But I just started to wonder
if maybe

55:23.506 --> 55:25.409
you showed up
just at the right time, and...

55:25.409 --> 55:27.576
I've been going for this thing
in the action,

55:27.576 --> 55:29.072
and I've never been able
to get it.

55:29.072 --> 55:31.844
Like, this feeling
of the pursuit of love.

55:31.844 --> 55:34.880
And how far would you go for
the one that you love and...

55:34.880 --> 55:37.685
-You know?
And then...

55:37.685 --> 55:39.753
Yeah. -You know, I realize
it's not very far with Ryder,

55:39.753 --> 55:41.183
- 'cause he's a drip.
- Right.

55:41.183 --> 55:42.822
- And he runs weird.
- Right.

55:42.822 --> 55:44.527
- And he can't do action. But...
- Well, it's...

55:44.527 --> 55:45.924
...you can.

55:45.924 --> 55:47.222
- You can.

55:47.222 --> 55:48.762
I'm unlimited with you.

55:48.762 --> 55:50.533
I can do everything
and everything with you,

55:50.533 --> 55:52.095
and it just made my brain
just...

55:53.228 --> 55:54.900
So cool.

55:54.900 --> 55:56.231
I don't need cuts.
I don't need gimmicks. -Really?

55:56.231 --> 55:58.233
I don't need anything.
I just need you.

55:58.233 --> 55:59.938
- To finish this movie.

55:59.938 --> 56:02.237
You know, maybe even make it
a great movie. -Wow.

56:02.237 --> 56:03.579
You know?

56:03.579 --> 56:05.779
- Wow. Okay.
- What do you think?

56:05.779 --> 56:07.550
Do you want to work together?

56:07.550 --> 56:10.047
Shoot the shit out of Sydney
Opera House in four hours?

56:10.047 --> 56:11.752
- Three hours and 52 minutes.
- Three hours and 52 minutes?

56:11.752 --> 56:13.083
Yeah.

56:13.083 --> 56:14.524
What are we waiting for?

56:14.524 --> 56:16.757
Okay, good.
Good! Okay!

56:16.757 --> 56:18.561
Venti, Venti, come on.

56:18.561 --> 56:20.464
I'm gonna get some dots
on your face, 'cause I need you

56:20.464 --> 56:22.389
but not your face. -Oh, God.
Get-- Yeah, just get rid of it.

56:22.389 --> 56:23.797
Yeah, I'm gonna stick Ryder's
head on you. -All of it. Just--

56:23.797 --> 56:25.931
- Okay. Cool. Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

56:25.931 --> 56:28.571
Ready for a take?
Make it rain, please!

56:32.201 --> 56:33.477

58:38.998 --> 58:40.362
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:40.362 --> 58:41.770
- Holster that.
- It's holstered.

58:41.770 --> 58:43.640
It's done. Forget.
You-you never saw it.

58:47.140 --> 58:49.547
Jody, do you like
Christina or Britney?

58:52.046 --> 58:53.716
I saw that.

58:53.716 --> 58:56.620
- You saw the finger guns?
- Oh, I saw the finger guns.

58:57.852 --> 58:59.282
She started it.

58:59.282 --> 59:01.284
Hi.

59:01.284 --> 59:03.088
I didn't ha--
I didn't have breakfast.

59:03.088 --> 59:04.727
Yeah, you did.

59:04.727 --> 59:06.421
I disagree. -I gave you
a brekky wrap this morning.

59:06.421 --> 59:08.258
Technically,
this is all meal penalty,

59:08.258 --> 59:10.194

- It's fine. Just-just sign.

59:10.194 --> 59:11.866
Thanks. -I'm just saying,
not everyone's gonna be as cool

59:11.866 --> 59:13.461
- about it as I am. You know?
- No, I get it.

59:13.461 --> 59:15.232
What is this?

59:15.232 --> 59:19.467
I've got you on a 5:55 flight
out of here. Okay?

59:19.467 --> 59:20.974
- I have a car waiting for you.
- Now?

59:20.974 --> 59:23.779
Engine's on. Yeah. Colt...

59:23.779 --> 59:26.540
there is some serious shit
going down, okay?

59:26.540 --> 59:29.312
I just told Jody I was gonna
meet her for karaoke.

59:29.312 --> 59:31.083
And I'm actually embarrassed
that I got you here

59:31.083 --> 59:33.085
- and got you all tangled up.

59:33.085 --> 59:35.120
I just want to get you out
of here before it escalates.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.627
Get your stuff together.
We're going.

59:36.627 --> 59:38.552
You're gonna miss the flight.
Thank you.

59:38.552 --> 59:40.059
- Sorry.
-Okay, but I'm late,

59:40.059 --> 59:41.665
and I got to get Ryder's dogs
to daycare.

59:41.665 --> 59:43.590
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath.
She gets hives.

59:43.590 --> 59:45.900
Hey, should I be
looking for another job, Alma?

59:45.900 --> 59:47.902
You're Ryder's assistant.
You must know.

59:47.902 --> 59:51.004
All I can tell you is that
if Ryder is a no-show tomorrow,

59:51.004 --> 59:52.841
the studio will shut us down.

59:52.841 --> 59:54.843
Ugh. Poor Jody.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.450
French. I know.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:42.891
I worked with him on a movie,
you know.

01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:44.354
Can't believe he kept him.

01:00:44.354 --> 01:00:45.894
Well, it's more for
a party trick, really.

01:00:45.894 --> 01:00:47.456
This one's got a command
where he'll bite people

01:00:47.456 --> 01:00:48.963
- in the balls.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We-we know.

01:00:48.963 --> 01:00:50.360
-  No, no, don't.

So, the last time I saw Tom,
everything was pretty normal.

01:01:08.576 --> 01:01:11.249
<i>He and Henry were
in some kind of drug-induced,</i>

01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:13.317
<i>shirtless shit-show
grappling match.</i>

01:01:13.317 --> 01:01:16.023
But then Gail called me early
the next morning in a panic.

01:01:16.023 --> 01:01:17.420
Drop whatever you're doing.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.993
Tom has lost his phone again.

01:01:18.993 --> 01:01:21.259
So I found the phone,
the one that Dressler,

01:01:21.259 --> 01:01:24.064
Ryder's creepy security goon,
just called me about.

01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:25.868
<i>Metalstorm</i> crew,
we have a call time

01:01:25.868 --> 01:01:27.199
of 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't
be late. -All right, mate.

01:01:27.199 --> 01:01:29.498
- All right, thanks, mate!

01:01:29.498 --> 01:01:31.841
Hey. Two shots of tequila,
please. -Ooh, Gail.

01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:33.777
- Hey.
- Wow.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.603
I didn't think you liked
coming to these things.

01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:37.946
What are you talking about?
I love listening to people

01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:40.344
murder my favorite songs.
Thank you. -

01:01:40.344 --> 01:01:41.752
-  Mmm.
-"Gin and Juice."

01:01:41.752 --> 01:01:43.281
I got to get to karaoke.

01:01:43.281 --> 01:01:45.349
- Hey!

01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:46.416
Thanks, Amy.

01:01:46.416 --> 01:01:47.714
Au revoir, Jean-Claude.

01:01:47.714 --> 01:01:48.957
You got to get rid
of that thing.

01:01:48.957 --> 01:01:50.420
Why don't you just give it
to Gail?

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.422
Whatever's on this phone
is a goddamn bazooka

01:01:52.422 --> 01:01:54.193
that'll blow
a movie star-sized hole

01:01:54.193 --> 01:01:55.898
through somebody's career.

01:01:55.898 --> 01:01:58.395
I'm happy to get this
into the hands of a good guy.

01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:00.562
- Okay...
- For the right price.

01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:02.300
What do you want for it?

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.807
A producer credit.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.237
On <i>Metalstorm?</i>

01:02:05.237 --> 01:02:06.304
Look, I need
career protection, okay?

01:02:06.304 --> 01:02:07.404
I'm burning myself with this.

01:02:07.404 --> 01:02:08.812
I'm a stunt guy.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.814
What am I supposed to do
about it?

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.442
You're a stunt guy
who used to date the director

01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.444
and seems to be getting close
to rekindling

01:02:14.444 --> 01:02:17.381
some sort of short but
legendary torrid love affair.

01:02:17.381 --> 01:02:18.822
Do you think
we're close to rekindling?

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:19.955
I mean, it feels like it
to me...

01:02:19.955 --> 01:02:22.287
Is it a deal or not?

01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:24.927
It can help you find Ryder.

01:02:24.927 --> 01:02:26.225
- I'll do what I can.

01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:27.655
I don't have the passcode.

01:02:27.655 --> 01:02:29.393
Just figure it out,
okay, stuntman?

01:02:29.393 --> 01:02:30.658
Just find Ryder.

01:02:30.658 --> 01:02:32.132
I'm gonna need you
to sign an NDA.

01:02:32.132 --> 01:02:33.628
As you know,
nothing in this industry...

01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:35.300
I don't have time for an NDA.
I got to--

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.400
- I'm late for karaoke.
-  -

01:02:45.915 --> 01:02:47.609

01:02:50.515 --> 01:02:52.548
Ryder's phone. Where is it?

01:02:59.687 --> 01:03:01.865
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:06.199
- You sad that he left town?
- Who?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.937
- Colt.
- No, he didn't.

01:03:07.937 --> 01:03:10.038
He's coming here. He's swinging
by to sing some karaoke.

01:03:10.038 --> 01:03:11.600
Jody. No.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.844
I... I gave him the tickets.

01:03:16.343 --> 01:03:18.673
- I see it! I see it!

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:23.183
- Engage your core.

01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:40.794
I need him to finish the movie.

01:03:40.794 --> 01:03:43.566
Why would-- why wouldn't you
talk to me about it?

01:03:49.871 --> 01:03:51.277
Give me that.

01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:54.313
- Fine.

01:03:54.313 --> 01:03:55.380
Call me chicken.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.810
- Huh?

01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:58.548
All right. Okay, tough guy.

01:04:09.427 --> 01:04:11.396
Okay, Jean-Claude.

01:04:11.396 --> 01:04:13.398
I'll buy you a drink
when this is over.

01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:15.697
<i>- Attaque!</i>

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:21.241
You've been so distracted.
You should have spoken to me.

01:04:21.241 --> 01:04:22.671
This crossed wires-- Excuse me.

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:24.211
Can I get another, please?
Thank you.

01:04:27.381 --> 01:04:28.875
God!

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:31.218

Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back! Stay back!

01:04:48.974 --> 01:04:51.733
I thought you wanted me
to get rid of him.

01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:54.340
And he just left?

01:04:56.608 --> 01:04:58.476
Gonna need a hand out here.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:01.578
Who are you working for?!
Where's Ryder?!

01:05:01.578 --> 01:05:02.876
- I don't know! I don't know!
- Tell me where he is!

01:05:02.876 --> 01:05:04.581
- Oh.

01:05:11.359 --> 01:05:13.161
- Where's the phone, stuntman?

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:15.295
I need that video!

01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:17.066
Wow, he didn't tell you.

01:05:17.066 --> 01:05:18.463

It's fine. It's fine.

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:34.908
- But you know what?
- He can do whatever he wants.

01:05:34.908 --> 01:05:37.482
He's an adult human male,
and he should do as he pleases.

01:05:37.482 --> 01:05:39.088
- He should just...
- Right. Yeah, he is.

go his own way, you know?

01:05:40.485 --> 01:05:42.256

y-you can focus up now.

Then find Ryder and get him
to finish Jody's movie.

01:10:23.933 --> 01:10:26.067
Okay. Well, shit, yeah.

01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:27.805
Venti, she's like a tech genius
at this stuff.

01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:29.543
- Thank you!

01:10:29.543 --> 01:10:30.742
Hey, Venti!

01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:32.546
- Ventilicious.
- Hey.

01:10:32.546 --> 01:10:34.449
What's poppin' on, boys?

01:10:34.449 --> 01:10:37.749
- Yeah, Ventinator.

01:10:37.749 --> 01:10:39.850
You know how
to get into this thing?

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:43.623
Oh, I've seen
some of these guys.

01:10:43.623 --> 01:10:45.724
This thing is a vault.

01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:47.627
It'll take me like two or
three days to crack this thing.

01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:49.431
Yeah, but you're like
a tech genius, you know?

01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:51.125
What if you don't have
three days?

01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:52.500
You need the password.
I'm telling you that.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.667
- You're next.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.372
Nigel. Nigel!

01:10:58.101 --> 01:11:00.508
Knowing Ryder, it's...

01:11:00.508 --> 01:11:03.005
written on a Post-it note
in his apartment somewhere.

01:11:03.005 --> 01:11:04.842
Okay.

01:11:04.842 --> 01:11:07.108
Okay, next up, we've got Dan.

01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:09.077
Come on, buddy. Come on, Dan.

01:11:09.077 --> 01:11:10.650
Don't be shy, mate.

01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.751
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:14.049
You owe me!

01:11:19.122 --> 01:11:21.122
It's got
to be around here somewhere.

01:11:21.122 --> 01:11:22.893
Mm-hmm. -Let's just split up.
Jean-Claude...

01:11:41.144 --> 01:11:42.748
Hello.

01:11:53.497 --> 01:11:54.925
Oh.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.226
You know what? I deserve this.

01:12:01.604 --> 01:12:02.867
Idiot.

01:12:05.366 --> 01:12:06.871
Colt?

01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:09.511
Colt! I got it! Colt!

01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:10.842
To finishing the movie.

01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:12.547
I think I got it.

01:12:13.715 --> 01:12:15.143
All right.

01:12:15.143 --> 01:12:16.980
That guy mentioned a video.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.818
Oh, baby, I'm here at work,

01:12:19.818 --> 01:12:22.249
but I got a little something
for you, a little surprise.

01:12:22.249 --> 01:12:24.086
It's just above my ass. Eh?

01:12:24.086 --> 01:12:25.989
Oh, my God. Cover your eyes.

01:12:25.989 --> 01:12:28.255
I think I've seen Tom's ass
more than my own. -

01:12:28.255 --> 01:12:29.531
Okay.

01:12:29.531 --> 01:12:32.160
Now is the winter
of our discontent

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.668
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York...

01:12:34.668 --> 01:12:35.999
He's such a dick.

01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:37.902
But, God, he's good.

01:12:37.902 --> 01:12:39.442
Yeah.

01:12:40.401 --> 01:12:41.741
What about this?

01:12:44.205 --> 01:12:46.746
Oh, here's that party his
assistant was talking about.

01:12:47.815 --> 01:12:49.551
Iggy.

01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:51.619
That's Henry.
That's Ryder's stunt double.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.986
He looks a lot like the guy
I saw at the hotel.

01:12:58.056 --> 01:13:01.255
When you were high?
And you were seeing unicorns?

01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:03.631
And a dead guy on ice.

01:13:08.735 --> 01:13:11.067
Hell yeah! Come on!

01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:13.036
What?! What?!

01:13:13.036 --> 01:13:15.071
Do I do my own stunts?

01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:16.402
I think I do.

01:13:16.402 --> 01:13:18.547
I think I freakin' do.

01:13:18.547 --> 01:13:19.977
Yeah, baby.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.460
Uh, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme...

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.527
Gimme the phone.
Gimme the phone.

01:13:34.697 --> 01:13:36.961
- Oh, shit.
- Did they just kill Henry?

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.940
They just killed Henry.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.942
- Oh, it's Venti.

01:13:51.978 --> 01:13:53.406
- Hey, uh... Hello?
-Dan.

01:13:53.406 --> 01:13:55.518
Turn on the news right now.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.917
I can't believe this!

01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:01.821
The dead body discovered this
morning at the Pendleton Hotel

01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:04.450
has been identified
as Henry Herrera,

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.761
an American stuntman known for
doubling superstar Tom Ryder.

01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:10.665
Authorities are investigating
his death as a murder.

01:14:10.665 --> 01:14:12.766
Their prime suspect
is another stuntman,

01:14:12.766 --> 01:14:14.999
Colt Seavers, who was
last seen in the hotel room

01:14:14.999 --> 01:14:17.837
where Herrera's body
was discovered.

01:14:17.837 --> 01:14:20.543
Police have released
this security footage

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:23.370
showing Seavers leaving
the scene of the crime.

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:25.845
If you have any information,
please do us a favor,

01:14:25.845 --> 01:14:28.716
reach out to Crime Stoppers
by the number on your screen.

01:14:28.716 --> 01:14:31.488
And we'll have more on that
later. In the meantime...

01:14:35.318 --> 01:14:37.120
I got to call Jody.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.320
RYDER
It's high noon

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.828
at the edge of
the universe, folks.

01:14:42.994 --> 01:14:44.160
Which one was that?

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.535
That was take four.

01:14:45.535 --> 01:14:47.064
RYDER
Goddamn it, Jody.

01:14:47.064 --> 01:14:48.736
I mean, it looks like
frickin' Burning Man.

01:14:48.736 --> 01:14:51.541
My balls are drenched.
I need a towel.

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:57.338
This dude always forgets
that he's mic'd.

01:14:57.338 --> 01:14:59.406
- I know.
- He says the craziest shit.

01:14:59.406 --> 01:15:01.716
Craziest shit. I know, I know.

01:15:01.716 --> 01:15:03.751
What, is it on airplane mode?

01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:05.852
If this was <i>The Fugitive</i>

01:15:05.852 --> 01:15:09.350
and you were Harrison Ford...

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.924
the bad guys would be
closing in.

01:15:13.827 --> 01:15:15.158
I call tomahawk.

01:15:15.158 --> 01:15:16.698
- Damn it.
- You stay alive.

01:15:16.698 --> 01:15:18.194
Stay alive.

01:15:18.194 --> 01:15:20.064
No matter how long it takes.

01:15:20.064 --> 01:15:22.704
No matter how far, I will

01:15:22.704 --> 01:15:25.036
find you!

01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:27.170
<i>- Last of the Mohicans.</i>
- Ah,

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:28.743
boy! Stunts!

01:15:28.743 --> 01:15:31.438
Damn it.

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:45.485
Shit, is this rubber? Oh, God.

01:16:00.434 --> 01:16:02.645
- Daniel Day-Lewis!

01:16:17.759 --> 01:16:19.728
Jason Bourne!

01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:37.009
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!

01:16:38.342 --> 01:16:40.375
- Give me the phone!

01:16:45.613 --> 01:16:47.118
Where's the phone, stuntman?

01:16:47.118 --> 01:16:48.988
We got to get this phone
to the cops.

01:16:48.988 --> 01:16:50.693
-Okay.
-It's the only thing--

01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:19.854
Hey, man bun!

01:17:19.854 --> 01:17:21.955
Where's the phone, stuntman?

01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:25.321
Jean-Claude, <i>attaque!</i>

01:17:35.564 --> 01:17:36.838
I'm gonna take that.

01:17:36.838 --> 01:17:38.367
Be careful of that, big fella.

01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:40.006
Shut up!

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.976
I'm gonna go out the front
and make sure no one's there.

01:17:42.976 --> 01:17:44.241
- Okay.
- All right.

01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:45.308
Hey, take Jean-Claude,
would you?

01:17:45.308 --> 01:17:47.541
- Okay. <i>Allons-y!</i>

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:52.513
Just you and me, stuntman.

01:17:52.513 --> 01:17:54.218
Shit.

01:18:05.528 --> 01:18:07.165
Colt's down.

01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:10.333
Big fella got away, though.

01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:12.137
Uh-huh.

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:21.982
You can make it. You can
make it. You can make it!

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:25.051
No! It's too dangerous!

01:18:25.051 --> 01:18:26.756
Got to be stairs.

01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:28.956
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:18:44.501 --> 01:18:46.600
Colt. Hey, man.

01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:54.443
Look at that.
Yeah, makin' a movie here.

01:18:55.446 --> 01:18:57.248
Could you leave us, please?

01:18:58.515 --> 01:18:59.855
Yeah.

01:19:02.156 --> 01:19:04.761
Ooh, Gail. So tense.

01:19:05.929 --> 01:19:07.962
You remember old Dressy, right?

01:19:10.096 --> 01:19:11.460
Stuntman.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.935
I never forget a fist.

01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:17.499
Listen, I'm gonna need
the phone. Where is it?

01:19:17.499 --> 01:19:19.776
It's a matter of urgency.
I need to know.

01:19:21.505 --> 01:19:24.913
Right. The one that proves
that you killed Henry, not me.

01:19:24.913 --> 01:19:26.178
- Eh...
- That phone.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.410
- Well...
- Yeah.

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.247
I'm gonna hold on to that.

01:19:29.247 --> 01:19:31.282
Seems like it's the only thing
keeping me alive right now.

01:19:31.282 --> 01:19:33.317
What?

01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:35.990
He's the prime suspect, Jody.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:39.026
Gail, come on.
Are you kidding me?

01:19:39.026 --> 01:19:40.423
- I know.
- Colt?

01:19:40.423 --> 01:19:41.655
- Yeah.
- There's no way.

01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:42.689
- That's what I said.
- There's no way!

01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:44.097
What went wrong?

01:19:44.097 --> 01:19:46.033
- What went wrong?
- Mmm.

01:19:46.033 --> 01:19:48.035
What went wrong?
Well, as I look at it,

01:19:48.035 --> 01:19:49.872
you know, you're--
you're torturing me

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.940
right outside your superyacht
like a Bond villain.

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.974
Dipshit!

01:19:52.974 --> 01:19:54.734
What went wrong?

01:19:55.704 --> 01:19:57.847
What went right?!

01:19:59.015 --> 01:20:02.610
You changed.

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.283
You changed.

01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:09.958
Yeah. We used to be
like brothers, you and I.

01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:13.126
Entered into the sacred bond
of actor and stuntman, man.

01:20:13.126 --> 01:20:14.897
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:16.624
You think Colt could murder
a human being?

01:20:16.624 --> 01:20:18.230
-No, I don't.
- Did you tell them that?

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.561
- I said that.
- This is a man--

01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:21.035
This is a man
who spent 23 minutes

01:20:21.035 --> 01:20:22.663
ushering a cockroach
out of my room once,

01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:24.038
and I was like, "Just stomp
on it," and he was like,

01:20:24.038 --> 01:20:25.831
"No, let it live."
I mean, it's Colt.

01:20:25.831 --> 01:20:27.470
I told them all of that.

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.143
I told him who he is--
who I thought he was.

01:20:30.143 --> 01:20:31.507
Did you, emphatically?

01:20:31.507 --> 01:20:33.047
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah, because he

01:20:33.047 --> 01:20:35.016
was at the airport
where you sent him.

01:20:35.016 --> 01:20:36.842
He never got on the plane, Jody.

01:20:36.842 --> 01:20:38.415
- How many movies have we done?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:20:38.415 --> 01:20:40.153
How many? Yeah, too many
to count, that's right.

01:20:40.153 --> 01:20:42.188
Yeah. -'Cause I put you
in the contract, didn't I?

01:20:42.188 --> 01:20:43.684
I put you there, right there.

01:20:43.684 --> 01:20:45.356
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? That's right,

01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:46.720
I had the assistant,
the makeup and hair... -Right.

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.326
...uh, trainer, and then boom,

01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:50.559
Ryder's number one stuntman,
Colt Seavers.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:52.825
That was me, I did that.
I did that for you.

01:20:52.825 --> 01:20:55.267
What are you gonna
do for me? Huh?

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.599
Die, I guess?

01:20:57.599 --> 01:20:59.205
Right? Die?

01:20:59.205 --> 01:21:00.734
- Is that the plan?
-It's nothing personal.

01:21:00.734 --> 01:21:02.241
Oh, my God.
Well, I'm taking it personal.

01:21:02.241 --> 01:21:03.605
- Yeah, I can see that.
- The torture.

01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:05.343
You know what?
It's just business.

01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:06.740
- The drugging, the Taser.
- You know, it's just business.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.280
I mean, Tom Ryder's
a global brand.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.051
- I'm taking it personal.
- I literally move markets.

01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:13.186
If I go down...
the freakin' Dow goes down.

01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:17.289
If you break your back,
I replace you like this. Boom.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.258
You know, if you'd just
stuck to your job

01:21:19.258 --> 01:21:21.392
instead of trying to
hog the spotlight,

01:21:21.392 --> 01:21:23.229
this wouldn't have happened.
I mean, Henry wouldn't be

01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:25.363
on the scene, his accident
wouldn't have happened,

01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:27.937
your accident...
freaky little fall.

01:21:27.937 --> 01:21:29.730
'Cause you just
push my buttons, man.

01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:30.896
Wait a second. What?

01:21:32.436 --> 01:21:34.867
What?

01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:37.210
What did you say
about my accident?

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.080
Well, you know,
you pushed me over the edge.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.082
You literally pushed a button.
I mean, you didn't--

01:21:41.082 --> 01:21:43.579
<i>I mean, I pushed the button.</i>

01:21:46.991 --> 01:21:49.750
<i>I had to crank it up a notch.</i>

01:21:56.528 --> 01:21:57.967
That was you?

01:21:57.967 --> 01:21:59.595
Yeah.

01:22:03.007 --> 01:22:05.238
Had to teach you
a little lesson, didn't I?

01:22:05.238 --> 01:22:07.240
Got a little
too big for your boots,

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.736
didn't you?

01:22:08.736 --> 01:22:10.177
Henry's no different, you know.

01:22:11.574 --> 01:22:14.742
Hey. You do your own stunts?

01:22:14.742 --> 01:22:16.348
Do I do my own stunts?

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.988
In front of all those people,
that's humiliating.

01:22:18.988 --> 01:22:21.056
And yeah, I'm gonna
kick you into next week.

01:22:23.324 --> 01:22:26.259
But then Gail, you know...

01:22:26.259 --> 01:22:28.657
- Remember Gail, right?
- I've known her for 15 years.

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:30.362
Oh, yeah. I forget, 'cause
you've been out of the game

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:31.957
- so long, you know?
- I introduced the two of you.

01:22:31.957 --> 01:22:33.464
Calls me up and says,
"It doesn't look good."

01:22:33.464 --> 01:22:36.038
Bad for marketing and renting,

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.271
and blah, blah, blah,
and murder and...

01:22:38.271 --> 01:22:40.438
I know, I-I-I d--

01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:44.211
I real-- I really
don't need this right now.

01:22:44.211 --> 01:22:46.180
Fucking Henry!

01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.281
Don't worry about it.

01:22:48.281 --> 01:22:50.514
You lay low...

01:22:50.514 --> 01:22:52.153
and I will handle everything.

01:22:53.519 --> 01:22:56.619
Maybe we don't know people
as well as we think we do.

01:22:56.619 --> 01:22:59.061
- Oh, my God.
- You know?

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.129
Oh, my God, it's Colt.

01:23:01.129 --> 01:23:02.559
- Give me the phone.
- No.

01:23:02.559 --> 01:23:04.231
- What are you doing?
- Gail, get off the pho--

01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:05.694
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Oh, my-- Jesus Christ, Gail!

01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:08.169
- Oh, my-- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:09.632
- Let me help you.
- No, stop it.

01:23:09.632 --> 01:23:10.864
- Let me take it up to--
- Do you know what?

01:23:10.864 --> 01:23:11.997
- Just give me a minute.
- Yep.

01:23:11.997 --> 01:23:13.141
Just give me a minute.

01:23:13.141 --> 01:23:15.374
- Yep.
- Come on.

01:23:16.344 --> 01:23:18.575
This plan was so simple.

01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:21.006
Yeah, we were gonna put
Henry's body on ice

01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:22.744
so it doesn't decompose.

01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:25.417
We could pull you out from
that rock you crawled under.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:27.452
- My life, yep.
- You know, scan your face.

01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.390
Dressy here is gonna stick you
on the murder video.

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.095
Drug you, drive you
and Henry's body

01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:36.021
off the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
in your car-- boom.

01:23:36.021 --> 01:23:38.364
You got murder, suicide.

01:23:38.364 --> 01:23:39.827
Cut. Check the gate.

01:23:39.827 --> 01:23:41.499
Move on. Beautiful.

01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:43.435
I think we have different ideas
of what simple is.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.030
Y-You just didn't
stay down, did you?

01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:46.900
You had to, like, uh,
create a big scene,

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.605
like Colt Seavers does.

01:23:48.605 --> 01:23:50.838
You could-- But you know what?
This can still work

01:23:50.838 --> 01:23:54.512
because we got the murder,
now we just need the suicide.

01:23:57.515 --> 01:23:59.451
- Sad.
- It's plot heavy.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.453
We're getting tangled
in exposition.

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.257
Lose the last part--
the suicide.

01:24:03.257 --> 01:24:05.226
You lose the audience
if there's too much.

01:24:05.226 --> 01:24:06.623
Colt.

01:24:06.623 --> 01:24:07.855
Where's the phone?

01:24:07.855 --> 01:24:11.199
Tom, you need carbs!

01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:14.433
Your brain runs on glucose!

01:24:14.433 --> 01:24:17.205
For simple cognitive functions.

01:24:17.205 --> 01:24:19.636
- You need them.
- Colt, you're the fall guy.

01:24:19.636 --> 01:24:21.803
You're the fall guy, you know.

01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:24.443
Where's the phone?

01:24:24.443 --> 01:24:26.742
I mean, I-- You can keep
taking hits all night,

01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:28.282
but you know what?

01:24:28.282 --> 01:24:30.317
I can think of a few
other people who can't.

01:24:30.317 --> 01:24:33.881
We could bring Dan up here,
maybe Jody, perhaps.

01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:35.916
I mean, I like Jody,
but you know.

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:38.226
There's no phone.

01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:39.788
Okay? That's the twist.

01:24:39.788 --> 01:24:41.229
No phone.

01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:44.056
He shot it out of my hand.

01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:45.629
Up there, go check.

01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:48.170
You, too, all of you.
I'll wait.

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:50.799
-  He shot it.
- You didn't know you did that?

01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:53.439
It's crazy. I've been wanting
to tell you this whole time.

01:24:53.439 --> 01:24:54.770
No, he didn't.

01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:56.805
- I was by the door frame.
- No.

01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:58.972
And he shoots it
out of my hands!

01:24:58.972 --> 01:25:00.512
- No.
- Take the ties off.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.415
- Oh, my God, what a relief.
- That's crazy.

01:25:02.415 --> 01:25:04.615
You were right about one thing,
that was the only thing

01:25:04.615 --> 01:25:07.915
keeping you alive.

01:25:07.915 --> 01:25:09.653
I really wish you could see

01:25:09.653 --> 01:25:11.083
what Jody's gonna do
with <i>Metalstorm.</i>

01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.590
It's gonna be awesome.

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:16.297
And honestly...
it's gonna be a banger.

01:25:17.564 --> 01:25:19.531
Not so cocky now,
are you, mate?

01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.962
Jesus, Mike Mike,
put a lid on it.

01:25:26.408 --> 01:25:28.474
Wish you didn't
break that bond, bro.

01:25:28.474 --> 01:25:30.036
Wish you didn't break that bond.

01:25:30.036 --> 01:25:32.445
All right, stuntman,
time for a drink, mate. Eh?

01:25:32.445 --> 01:25:35.481
- There we go. Eh?

01:25:35.481 --> 01:25:37.142
Help!

01:25:37.142 --> 01:25:38.979
- Help!

01:25:38.979 --> 01:25:40.717
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Help!

01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:42.719
Shut up, mate.

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:52.696
There.

01:25:52.696 --> 01:25:54.236
This fire gag's real.

01:26:08.945 --> 01:26:10.483
Come on, guys, start the boat.

01:26:10.483 --> 01:26:11.849
He's gone the wrong way.

01:26:24.301 --> 01:26:25.729
Shit!

01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:38.967
Oh, Colt.

01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:40.067
Colt?

01:27:40.067 --> 01:27:41.442
- Hey.
- What's going on?

01:27:41.442 --> 01:27:42.476
What'd you sing?

01:27:42.476 --> 01:27:44.346
- What?
- At karaoke.

01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:45.743
- I'm sorry I didn't make it.
- It doesn't matter.

01:27:45.743 --> 01:27:47.316
Listen. Everyone's saying
you killed Henry.

01:27:47.316 --> 01:27:48.977
- What's happening?
- Oh, that's not true.

01:27:48.977 --> 01:27:50.517
You're gonna hear a lot
of things that aren't true.

01:27:50.517 --> 01:27:53.322
I just wanted to say that
when I first got here,

01:27:53.322 --> 01:27:55.423
when you asked how I was doing
and I gave you the thumbs-up,

01:27:55.423 --> 01:27:56.985
when you were like,
"That's stunt guy bullshit,"

01:27:56.985 --> 01:27:59.251
and you're right,
it's total cliché,

01:27:59.251 --> 01:28:01.022
but, you know,
there's a reason you don't see

01:28:01.022 --> 01:28:02.793
the thumbs-down stunt guy.

01:28:04.698 --> 01:28:07.435
You know, it's kind of part
of our training.

01:28:07.435 --> 01:28:09.965
Right? You know,
you get hit by a car,

01:28:09.965 --> 01:28:11.472
you get thrown out of a window,

01:28:11.472 --> 01:28:13.375
you get set on fire,
you give the thumbs-up.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.839
But, uh, after my accident--

01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:19.843
turns out was not an accident,
by the way--

01:28:19.843 --> 01:28:22.714
I, uh...

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.518
I wasn't okay.

01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:27.884
And not because I broke my back,

01:28:27.884 --> 01:28:31.492
because I just felt
like a huge...

01:28:31.492 --> 01:28:33.257
failure.

01:28:36.323 --> 01:28:38.323
And I realized that, uh...

01:28:38.323 --> 01:28:40.831
you know, I'm not invincible.

01:28:40.831 --> 01:28:42.536
Huge shocker.

01:28:43.737 --> 01:28:46.540
And I thought maybe
I wasn't so special

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.333
or something, so I, uh...

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.907
just figured that
the thumbs-down version of me

01:28:50.907 --> 01:28:53.745
wasn't what you got
into it for, so I disappeared.

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:56.242
But, you know, I didn't
just disappear on you.

01:28:56.242 --> 01:28:59.553
Uh... just disappeared on,

01:28:59.553 --> 01:29:04.052
on, uh, myself... too.

01:29:05.792 --> 01:29:07.594
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:29:07.594 --> 01:29:09.596
You deserved more than that.
I'm sorry.

01:29:09.596 --> 01:29:11.862
I just wanted you to be honest.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.295
You know, honestly,
it, uh, all hurts.

01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:24.072
Getting hit by a car hurts.

01:29:24.072 --> 01:29:26.074
Getting thrown out
of a window hurts.

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:30.210
Getting set on fire
really hurts.

01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:33.422
But, uh...

01:29:36.658 --> 01:29:38.988
...none of it ever hurt as much
as not being with you.

01:29:41.564 --> 01:29:43.256
Where are you?

01:29:44.732 --> 01:29:47.865
Is that from a movie
or did I just make that up?

01:29:47.865 --> 01:29:49.570
It's pretty good.

01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:51.066
-There he is!
- You can use it if you want.

01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:56.137
No, please...

01:29:56.137 --> 01:29:58.172
For what it's worth,
I'm still in love with you.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.978
And I don't think you should
give up on that happy ending.

01:30:01.978 --> 01:30:03.177
Colt.

01:30:04.081 --> 01:30:05.784

Jody, you need
to be quiet. Don't say a word.

01:34:10.591 --> 01:34:12.195
Wait, wait. No.

01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:23.239
Jody...

01:34:33.856 --> 01:34:38.353
You think you can come
to my set and sneak up on me?

01:34:45.098 --> 01:34:46.460
Wait!

01:34:48.805 --> 01:34:50.596
It's me. It's me.

Remember?

01:34:53.599 --> 01:34:56.008
Jesus Christ.

01:34:56.008 --> 01:34:57.504
I knew it.

01:34:57.504 --> 01:34:58.604
- I knew it.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.915
I knew you were alive.

01:35:01.915 --> 01:35:03.048
Three shows a day,

01:35:03.048 --> 01:35:04.115
six days a week for three years.

The <i>Miami Vice</i> stunt show.

01:35:07.417 --> 01:35:08.790
You remembered.

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:11.584
Yes.
I'm happy you're alive, Colt.

01:35:11.584 --> 01:35:13.520
Colt, I'm so happy you're alive.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.060
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.897
- What were you doing...
- Nice work with the pen.

01:35:16.897 --> 01:35:18.261
So sorry. -No, it was great.
You got it out just in time.

01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:19.933
I think the ink poisoning
didn't set in.

01:35:19.933 --> 01:35:22.397
-  Chef's kiss.
- What's going on?

01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:24.267
Huh? -Everyone's saying
that you killed Henry.

01:35:24.267 --> 01:35:26.434
Ryder killed Henry.
He framed me.

01:35:26.434 --> 01:35:27.732
There's footage of you.

01:35:27.732 --> 01:35:29.635
- Well, he deepfaked me.
- What?

01:35:29.635 --> 01:35:31.703
They do it all the time
on the Internet.

01:35:31.703 --> 01:35:34.310
They take Tom Cruise's face,
and they put it on yours.

01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:35.740
And you can't tell
the difference.

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.148
No. Okay, so where's
the real footage

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.117
of Ryder killing Henry?
How do we get it?

01:35:39.117 --> 01:35:41.053
It was on Ryder's phone, and
then it got destroyed because

01:35:41.053 --> 01:35:43.220
Dan's <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>
plan didn't work out. -What?

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.091
It's not his fault, you know?
He called tomahawk first, okay.

01:35:46.091 --> 01:35:47.455
I got "blanks only."

01:35:47.455 --> 01:35:48.720
And it was going
pretty well, actually,

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.557
and then Dressler showed up.

01:35:50.557 --> 01:35:53.395
So he, you know, he does this,
like, Jason Bourne shit.

01:35:53.395 --> 01:35:55.969
Okay, I have so many questions.

01:35:55.969 --> 01:35:57.465
Okay.

01:35:57.465 --> 01:35:59.467
Who else knows you're alive?

01:35:59.467 --> 01:36:01.238
- No one.
- Great.

01:36:01.238 --> 01:36:02.910
No, that's the point.
I mean, I figure

01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:04.109
we can't finish the movie
unless they think I'm dead.

01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:05.770
What movie?

01:36:05.770 --> 01:36:06.815
<i>Metalstorm.</i>

01:36:06.815 --> 01:36:08.575
What about <i>Metalstorm?</i>

01:36:08.575 --> 01:36:09.983
If they think I'm dead,
they'll come back and finish.

01:36:09.983 --> 01:36:11.149
- Who?
- Ryder.

01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:12.854
- Finish what?
- The movie.

01:36:12.854 --> 01:36:14.185
<i>- Metalstorm?</i>
- Exactly.

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:16.022
- Are you insane? You are insane.
- What?

01:36:16.022 --> 01:36:17.485
You need to be
burning your fingerprints off,

01:36:17.485 --> 01:36:18.651
and you need to be
getting across the border

01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:20.356
as fast as possible.

01:36:20.356 --> 01:36:22.688
We're gonna hide you
until we can clear your name.

01:36:22.688 --> 01:36:24.624
None of it matters anymore.
It's just a stupid movie.

01:36:24.624 --> 01:36:25.691
- What?
- It's a stupid movie.

01:36:25.691 --> 01:36:27.165
Don't say that.

01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:29.761
That's <i>Metalstorm</i>
you're talking about.

01:36:29.761 --> 01:36:32.038
That's the movie you spent
your whole life trying to make.

01:36:32.038 --> 01:36:33.699
Who knows?

01:36:33.699 --> 01:36:35.701
You might inspire a whole
generation of little Jodys

01:36:35.701 --> 01:36:39.012
to pick up cameras
and make their own movies.

01:36:41.016 --> 01:36:43.016
You're just-- you're special.

01:36:44.184 --> 01:36:46.382
And all of us get to be
a part of something special

01:36:46.382 --> 01:36:48.648
because it comes from you.

01:36:48.648 --> 01:36:52.025
I obviously failed
at getting us our happy ending,

01:36:52.025 --> 01:36:53.785
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

01:36:53.785 --> 01:36:55.864
Space Cowboy and Aliena
not have theirs.

01:37:02.167 --> 01:37:03.531
Jody, my love!

01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:04.796
- One sec!
-  I'm coming...

01:37:04.796 --> 01:37:06.204
-  Stop it.

01:37:06.204 --> 01:37:07.733
Gail. She's in on it.

01:37:07.733 --> 01:37:09.405
- What?
- Yes.

01:37:09.405 --> 01:37:11.209
Okay, come on. -Let's just
kiss a little bit first.

01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:13.013
No, come on, we g-- got to get
you in the bathroom, please.

01:37:14.544 --> 01:37:15.774
Come on.

01:37:17.382 --> 01:37:19.151
Come on.

01:37:19.151 --> 01:37:21.648
- Christ!

01:37:21.648 --> 01:37:22.990
Got to work.

01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:24.926
You all right in there,
my darling?

01:37:24.926 --> 01:37:27.390
Here, this-- Take this soap
and rub it on my belly.

01:37:29.262 --> 01:37:30.899
Get in the bedroom.

01:37:30.899 --> 01:37:33.396
- Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:37:33.396 --> 01:37:35.728
- Be quiet. Don't make a sound.
-Jod?

01:37:35.728 --> 01:37:37.037
- My head. The head.
- What?

01:37:39.534 --> 01:37:41.272
- Hi!
-Hey. Hello, you.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:43.505
- Hey. Hey.
- Aw, come here.

01:37:43.505 --> 01:37:44.913
Thank you.

01:37:44.913 --> 01:37:46.343
Aw, how's my favorite director?

01:37:46.343 --> 01:37:47.740
Uh, a bit emotional, you know.

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.247
Oh, no-- Jesus.

01:37:49.247 --> 01:37:50.875
Like Johnny and Amber
have just been here.

01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:52.844
I just need to vent,
'cause it's been...

01:37:52.844 --> 01:37:55.517
- it's just been so much.
- I know. I know.

01:37:55.517 --> 01:37:57.123
- I'm so sorry about Colt.
- Thank you.

01:37:57.123 --> 01:37:59.587
You know, it's such a shame,
but what a mess.

01:37:59.587 --> 01:38:00.962
- Right.
- Who knew?

01:38:00.962 --> 01:38:02.854
- Yeah.
- I mean, I tried to help him.

01:38:02.854 --> 01:38:05.296
I hope you know that, but
sometimes you can't help people

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:06.759
- who don't want to be saved.
- Right.

01:38:06.759 --> 01:38:09.201
But silver lining

01:38:09.201 --> 01:38:12.237
to this very dark
cloud.

01:38:12.237 --> 01:38:14.074
I've got Ryder to come back.

01:38:14.074 --> 01:38:15.702
- And I have a plan.
- Really?

01:38:15.702 --> 01:38:17.704
But we're not
gonna be able to do

01:38:17.704 --> 01:38:20.575
your big third act set piece,
the car jump.

01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:23.710
It is an impossible jump,
especially now with Colt gone.

01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:25.778
- Dead.
- He's gone.

01:38:25.778 --> 01:38:27.989
- He's so dead.
- Stay with me.

01:38:27.989 --> 01:38:29.485
I spoke to Venti.

01:38:29.485 --> 01:38:31.421
She says that she can do it
in VFX.

01:38:31.421 --> 01:38:32.818
The car jump.

01:38:32.818 --> 01:38:35.095
All we need to focus on
is Ryder's new,

01:38:35.095 --> 01:38:38.593
final, bombastic monologue.

01:38:38.593 --> 01:38:39.968
I've read the pages.

01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:41.464
God, you smashed it.
I knew you would.

01:38:41.464 --> 01:38:43.004
- We're gonna get him covered.
- Yeah.

01:38:43.004 --> 01:38:45.666
You, meanwhile...

01:38:45.666 --> 01:38:48.273
please go and rest up in Fiji,
on me.

01:38:48.273 --> 01:38:51.507
You know?
Plop yourself on a beach.

01:38:51.507 --> 01:38:53.938
And I'm gonna take care
of all of it for you.

01:38:53.938 --> 01:38:54.983
Gail.

01:38:54.983 --> 01:38:56.512
You've got so much to process.

01:38:56.512 --> 01:38:58.250
- No.
- I can take care of all of it.

01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:00.780
No. This is my movie.

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:02.452
- Now, listen to me.

01:39:02.452 --> 01:39:03.948
I've learned so much from you.

01:39:03.948 --> 01:39:06.621
- I know. Thank you.
- And I'm very grateful.

01:39:06.621 --> 01:39:08.755
But the lesson I stand by now,

01:39:08.755 --> 01:39:10.328
- that you've taught me...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:13.958
You fall down,
you get right back up.

01:39:16.961 --> 01:39:18.963
I am directing this movie, yeah.

01:39:18.963 --> 01:39:20.470
Oh, my God, that's my girl.

01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:22.373
It went in. I'm so proud
of you. -Good. Okay.

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.935
Thank you. All right,
let's get you out of here.

01:39:23.935 --> 01:39:25.772
- One last thing.
- Yeah?

01:39:25.772 --> 01:39:27.444
Have you seen Dan? -Nope.
I think he's by the taco truck.

01:39:27.444 --> 01:39:28.874
- You haven't heard from him?
- He's probably-probably

01:39:28.874 --> 01:39:30.150
over there somewhere.
Thank you so much.

01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.712
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:39:31.712 --> 01:39:33.186
Thanks for the pep talk.
Okay, buh-bye. -

01:39:33.186 --> 01:39:34.286
- Love you, darling.
- Love you, too. Bye!

01:39:34.286 --> 01:39:36.189
Oof.

01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:37.718
You're gonna finish the movie.

01:39:37.718 --> 01:39:40.358
No, I'm gonna clear your name.
Okay, now listen.

01:39:40.358 --> 01:39:41.557
Why can't we do both?

01:39:41.557 --> 01:39:42.657
I think we can.

01:39:42.657 --> 01:39:44.461
We're gonna bring him to set,

01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:47.497
in a controlled environment,
and then we surround him...

01:39:47.497 --> 01:39:49.961
And we beat the shit out of him.

01:39:49.961 --> 01:39:51.468
No.

01:39:51.468 --> 01:39:53.305
We're gonna force
a confession out of him

01:39:53.305 --> 01:39:55.307
by putting him in a scene.

01:39:55.307 --> 01:39:56.902
Right. -You know,
he always forgets he's mic'd.

01:39:56.902 --> 01:39:58.376
That's better.

01:39:58.376 --> 01:39:59.839
I just don't know
how to do it yet.

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:05.086
I know how to do that.

01:40:07.288 --> 01:40:09.486
Make him do his own stunt.

01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:11.092
The impossible jump.

01:40:11.092 --> 01:40:13.523
Then we beat the shit
out of him.

01:40:13.523 --> 01:40:16.798
One seventy-four,
alpha, take two.

01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:21.168
JODY
And action!

01:40:21.168 --> 01:40:23.269
O-One second, one second,
one second.

01:40:26.032 --> 01:40:27.702
- Action!

01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:31.002
It's high noon

01:40:31.002 --> 01:40:32.905
at the edge of
the universe, folks.

01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:51.891
Now, we're facing
a powerful enemy.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.062
An alien species born of
the worst of humanity's traits.

01:40:58.062 --> 01:41:01.373
Well, what our enemy doesn't see

01:41:01.373 --> 01:41:04.904
is that their demise
is imminent.

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:10.846
And the most powerful weapon
in all galaxy?

01:41:13.915 --> 01:41:15.849
Love.

01:41:17.358 --> 01:41:23.956
Inside each and every
one of you is a spark, baby.

01:41:23.956 --> 01:41:25.727
An ember.

01:41:25.727 --> 01:41:28.092
A goddamn fire!

01:41:31.966 --> 01:41:35.066
Love is how we will win.

01:41:35.066 --> 01:41:37.475
And even if we lose,

01:41:37.475 --> 01:41:41.281
we're gonna die
fighting for a happy ending!

01:41:41.281 --> 01:41:44.515
- Hell yeah!

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.110
Whoo!

01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:48.112
Well, let's go and get it, then!

01:41:48.112 --> 01:41:51.082
Get on out there and go!

01:41:51.082 --> 01:41:53.986
Who's with me?!
Who is with me?! Let's go!

01:41:53.986 --> 01:41:55.955
Cut! Yes!

01:41:55.955 --> 01:41:57.990
So good, so good.

01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:59.332
- Thank you.
-  Was that it?

01:41:59.332 --> 01:42:00.465
- God, yeah.
- Did we get it?

01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:02.126
- It was so good.
- We got it?

01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:03.534
- Magic. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, it was hot, babe.

01:42:03.534 --> 01:42:05.206
Oh, my God. Gail was in floods.

01:42:05.206 --> 01:42:06.867
I really felt that one.
I really felt that one.

01:42:06.867 --> 01:42:08.473
- She was-- Of course you did.
- 'Cause I had tears.

01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:10.035
Of course you did.
Yeah, I know. I can see them.

01:42:10.035 --> 01:42:11.773
-  -
- Yeah, it was fantastic.

01:42:11.773 --> 01:42:14.006
So, listen, all we have left
is the alien truck coverage.

01:42:14.006 --> 01:42:15.447
- All right? That's it.
- No.

01:42:15.447 --> 01:42:17.141
Yep. We're gonna do
the car jump. -No.

01:42:17.141 --> 01:42:18.879
No one told me about
another setup. -We said-- No.

01:42:18.879 --> 01:42:20.650
- There's another setup?
- Venti's gonna do that in VFX,

01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:22.487
so we're out of here. -I know,
but we need his close-up.

01:42:22.487 --> 01:42:24.049
All right? I need his close-up
right here for the coverage.

01:42:24.049 --> 01:42:25.193
All right? 15 minutes tops.
That's all I need.

01:42:25.193 --> 01:42:26.788
This is the bit,
do you remember,

01:42:26.788 --> 01:42:28.460
where Space Cowboy steals
the alien vehicle? -Hmm.

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.857
- Come on. This is his moment.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:42:29.857 --> 01:42:31.199
I'm not gonna do
any driving, right?

01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:32.794
Because I'm gonna feel
really nauseous.

01:42:32.794 --> 01:42:34.059
It's a blue screen setup.

01:42:34.059 --> 01:42:36.204
I need this. I need this, okay?

01:42:37.196 --> 01:42:38.635
Zero notice here.

01:42:38.635 --> 01:42:40.670
We're moving as fast
as we can, all right?

01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:43.574
Everyone, double the pace, yes?!

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:45.873
Use those muscles!
Yes, good! Thank you!

01:42:50.583 --> 01:42:53.177
Everyone in position!

01:42:53.177 --> 01:42:55.047
Light the pyro!

01:42:56.292 --> 01:43:00.657
We need enough charges to blow
this canyon sky-high, people.

01:43:00.657 --> 01:43:02.362
NIGEL
McCabe, where are we?

01:43:02.362 --> 01:43:03.693
Going as fast as I can, Nige.

01:43:03.693 --> 01:43:05.024
We're as ready as we can be.

01:43:05.024 --> 01:43:06.564
Okay. Hey, get Ray to come in

01:43:06.564 --> 01:43:08.500
and check the mic
before we go, okay? -Copy.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.272
Sound, can you come down here
and check Ryder's mic, please?

01:43:16.378 --> 01:43:17.938
All right, Tom. You ready?

01:43:17.938 --> 01:43:19.610
- Yeah.
- Okay. Remember this bit?

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.842
You're gonna be in
the alien vehicle. -Mm-hmm.

01:43:20.842 --> 01:43:21.909
- Okay? Okay.
- Yep.

01:43:21.909 --> 01:43:23.251
And with nowhere to go,

01:43:23.251 --> 01:43:24.582
you're gonna jump the car
over the ravine.

01:43:24.582 --> 01:43:26.419
So I just need
a quick pop on you...

01:43:26.419 --> 01:43:28.047
Space Cowboy
ain't scared of no ravine.

01:43:28.047 --> 01:43:29.917
- Of course he's not.
- So I'm thinking maybe just

01:43:29.917 --> 01:43:31.215
a couple of reaction shots
of me gritting my teeth. -Yeah.

01:43:31.215 --> 01:43:32.084
Like, "Goddamn."
Something like that.

01:43:32.084 --> 01:43:33.459
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stoic.

01:43:33.459 --> 01:43:34.790
- Yeah, yeah. I like it.
- All right?

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:36.462
- What do you think?
- I like it. Okay.

01:43:36.462 --> 01:43:37.562
I think it's gonna be great.
Yeah, I love the choice.

01:43:37.562 --> 01:43:38.860
All right, let's pop these on.

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.466
- Okay. What's this?
- There you go.

01:43:40.466 --> 01:43:41.863
No, this is because
you've escaped the aliens.

01:43:41.863 --> 01:43:43.194
Is this necessary?
It's a bit much, no?

01:43:43.194 --> 01:43:44.030
Yeah. It looks cool.
Raise the stakes.

01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:45.768
It's kind of cool.

01:43:45.768 --> 01:43:47.374
- Yeah. It's cool. Okay.
- Raise the stakes.

01:43:47.374 --> 01:43:48.573
- Let's do it.
- 'Cause you know, Space Cowboy.

01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:50.377
Nobody can get at
the Space Cowboy.

01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:52.071
- No way. Even when he's cuffed.
- Excuse me. Tom, sorry.

01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:53.710
Jesus, Ray. I told you
to do it before I got on set.

01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:55.415
- Appreciate you, Tom.

01:43:55.415 --> 01:43:56.416
Thank you. Sound good.

01:43:56.416 --> 01:43:57.648
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:59.111
- So...
- So...

01:43:59.111 --> 01:44:00.420
You got this guy
coming on your left. -Yep.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.982
- Hey, bro.
- All right, take him out.

01:44:01.982 --> 01:44:02.983
Someone else is gonna
crash down on the bonnet.

01:44:02.983 --> 01:44:04.655
You're gonna take him out.

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:06.393
No, no, no. See, what I'm
thinking is maybe I come down,

01:44:06.393 --> 01:44:08.989
I take him out first,
and I'm like "pow, pow, pow."

01:44:08.989 --> 01:44:11.057
- I slide over and go "pow."
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:44:11.057 --> 01:44:12.894
And then maybe I say
a little line like,

01:44:12.894 --> 01:44:15.996
"I was shooting aliens
way before I was paid to."

01:44:15.996 --> 01:44:18.064
Fantastic.
All right, let's lock it up.

01:44:18.064 --> 01:44:20.066
- Let's shoot, Nigel.
-Standing by, please.

01:44:20.066 --> 01:44:21.166
All right.

01:44:21.166 --> 01:44:22.574
Take one. Marker.

01:44:22.574 --> 01:44:25.973
In three, two, one, action.

01:44:27.271 --> 01:44:28.844
Not your lucky day, alien.

01:44:28.844 --> 01:44:30.615
You got to go.

01:44:31.684 --> 01:44:32.782
You can't outrun me.

01:44:32.782 --> 01:44:35.323
I'm Space Cowboy!

01:44:35.323 --> 01:44:36.456
Yahoo!

01:44:36.456 --> 01:44:38.249
You are approaching the ravine.

01:44:38.249 --> 01:44:39.459
There's nowhere else to go.

01:44:39.459 --> 01:44:41.252
- Turn right. Go on.

01:44:41.252 --> 01:44:42.594
You have no choice.

01:44:42.594 --> 01:44:43.595
You're gonna
have to make the jump.

01:44:43.595 --> 01:44:46.598
In three, two, one.

01:44:46.598 --> 01:44:49.931
Yeehaw!

01:44:49.931 --> 01:44:51.471
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, hey.

01:44:51.471 --> 01:44:53.099
Who is that in the car with him?

01:44:53.099 --> 01:44:55.772
We're-we're in the middle
of a take right now, asshole.

01:44:55.772 --> 01:44:57.609
What are you doing? Ah!

01:44:57.609 --> 01:44:59.677
He's just buckling you in.
Safety first. That's it. -Ow!

01:44:59.677 --> 01:45:01.976
It's really tight.
Is this necessary?

01:45:01.976 --> 01:45:04.011
Hey, we are filming right now.

01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:06.178
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:45:06.178 --> 01:45:07.619
Sell it, Tom. It looks amazing.
Take a deep breath.

01:45:07.619 --> 01:45:09.819
It does not look--
Get out of the car.

01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.217
Howdy.

01:45:12.217 --> 01:45:14.186
- No, no, wait. Stop. No.

01:45:15.156 --> 01:45:16.221
Wait, what's happening?

01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:18.124
Yeehaw!

01:45:18.124 --> 01:45:20.324
Oh, my God! Whoa!

01:45:20.324 --> 01:45:22.568
Get to the cars!

01:45:25.538 --> 01:45:27.232
Jody, what the hell
are you doing?!

01:45:27.232 --> 01:45:28.233
I'm trying to get something
real out of him, Gail.

01:45:28.233 --> 01:45:29.542
There's no cameras on him!

01:45:31.777 --> 01:45:34.811
Hey, Dan? They're approaching
Ambush Alley right now.

01:45:34.811 --> 01:45:36.076
We're ready.

01:45:37.682 --> 01:45:40.586
Let me out right now!

01:45:40.586 --> 01:45:43.655
What are you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill me? Again?!

01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:50.794
- Can you untie me?
- No.

01:45:57.264 --> 01:45:58.868
McCabe!

01:45:58.868 --> 01:46:02.443
Smoke screen in three, two, one!

01:46:02.443 --> 01:46:04.368
Whoa!

01:46:04.368 --> 01:46:06.304
This does not seem safe, man!

01:46:11.784 --> 01:46:14.521
Dan, where are they?
Do you have eyes on them?

01:46:14.521 --> 01:46:16.820
I see 'em.
Everything's going to plan.

01:46:19.561 --> 01:46:21.429
I'll block the road.

01:46:21.429 --> 01:46:23.288
They shall not pass!

01:46:23.288 --> 01:46:26.093
I see them.
They're entering Ambush Alley.

01:46:30.737 --> 01:46:32.440
I can't see shit!

01:46:34.235 --> 01:46:36.235
McCabe, one!

01:46:37.172 --> 01:46:39.513
McCabe, two!

01:46:42.978 --> 01:46:44.749
McCabe! Now!

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.431
I love my job.

01:47:00.767 --> 01:47:04.571
Whoa, mama!

01:47:04.571 --> 01:47:06.903
Oh, goddamn!

01:47:06.903 --> 01:47:09.433
I can't think straight when
you drive like this. -

01:47:09.433 --> 01:47:10.940
You're supposed to be dead.

01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:14.009
You blew up
in-in a thousand pieces.

01:47:14.009 --> 01:47:15.340
You went kaboom.

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.980
Why would I have blown up,
Tom Ryder?

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.279
Why are you saying my name
like that?

01:47:20.279 --> 01:47:21.984
That is your name,
isn't it, Tom Ryder? -Yes, yes.

01:47:21.984 --> 01:47:23.491
A blind man could see
that you're

01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:25.020
- Tom Ryder.
- You're saying that like...

01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.593
-  "Ryder, Tom Ryder."
- Okay. That's me.

01:47:26.593 --> 01:47:27.858
You're saying it like
some obsessed fangirl.

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:29.354
That's me, Colt Seavers,
saying that.

01:47:29.354 --> 01:47:30.927
Roll the cameras.
We're heading for the jump.

01:47:30.927 --> 01:47:32.159
Tom Ryder's
doing his own stunts!

01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:33.996
Everyone, roll. Arm car?

01:47:33.996 --> 01:47:35.261
Check.

01:47:35.261 --> 01:47:36.636
- Heli.
-Check.

01:47:36.636 --> 01:47:38.165
I'm done taking the falls
for you.

01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:39.804
You're gonna do your own stunts
from now on.

01:47:39.804 --> 01:47:41.366
I don't want to do
my own stunts, Colt! -Relax.

01:47:41.366 --> 01:47:43.434
It's just a 250-foot jump
that'll probably kill us.

01:47:43.434 --> 01:47:45.975
It's never been done before.
It's for Comic-Con.

01:47:45.975 --> 01:47:48.945
- It's Hall H. It's a big deal.
- What are you doing, man?

01:47:48.945 --> 01:47:50.342
I thought it'd be fitting.

01:47:50.342 --> 01:47:52.685
Me and you, Tom Ryder,
one last stunt.

01:47:52.685 --> 01:47:54.885
You know,
like Thelma and Louise.

01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:56.821
- Thelma and Louise?
- Yeah.

01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:59.054
- They die at the end.
- Exactly!

01:47:59.054 --> 01:48:00.957
Murder-suicide.

01:48:00.957 --> 01:48:02.926
Can you just pull over
and let me out right now?

01:48:04.226 --> 01:48:06.699
You're not getting
out of this car until you,

01:48:06.699 --> 01:48:09.130
Tom Ryder, tell me,
Colt Seavers, the truth!

01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:10.230
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:11.803
It was all Gail.

01:48:11.803 --> 01:48:13.805
When I killed Henry,
she wanted to cover it up

01:48:13.805 --> 01:48:15.334
because, to be honest,

01:48:15.334 --> 01:48:17.842
Space Cowboy's one of
my best roles yet, Colt,

01:48:17.842 --> 01:48:19.503
and I don't want
this movie to fail.

01:48:19.503 --> 01:48:21.175
So you're saying that Gail Meyer

01:48:21.175 --> 01:48:24.244
was responsible for framing me
for your murder of Henry?

01:48:24.244 --> 01:48:26.147
Yes! Yes!

01:48:26.147 --> 01:48:27.918
But what's your real name?

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:29.524
Tom Ryder.

01:48:30.593 --> 01:48:32.021
Did you get that, Jody?

01:48:32.021 --> 01:48:34.419
We got it! He confessed.

01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:36.058
You wearing a wire?
Bro, you recording this?

01:48:36.058 --> 01:48:37.763
This is entrapment.
You can't do that.

01:48:37.763 --> 01:48:39.391
- What are you doing?
- No, it's not entrapment,

01:48:39.391 --> 01:48:41.965
because you're wearing
the wire, dipshit!

01:48:46.068 --> 01:48:47.399
He's going for it. Go. Go now.

01:48:47.399 --> 01:48:48.906
I'm just an actor!

01:48:48.906 --> 01:48:50.204
Wait.

01:48:50.204 --> 01:48:52.041
He has a mouth guard.

01:48:52.041 --> 01:48:54.615
I don't have a mouth guard.

01:49:42.456 --> 01:49:44.423
- Oh, good.
-Colt!

01:49:44.423 --> 01:49:46.898
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?

01:49:48.262 --> 01:49:49.736
Are you okay?

01:49:49.736 --> 01:49:51.463

I'd make the camera up to you.

01:49:51.463 --> 01:49:53.267

Dressler, come in! -Ah!

01:49:54.939 --> 01:49:57.568
Oy, can you hear me?
We've got to get out of here!

01:49:57.568 --> 01:49:58.910
RYDER
This is all Gail's fault, man.

01:49:58.910 --> 01:50:00.505
This is all Gail's idea.

01:50:00.505 --> 01:50:01.913
-Give me that confession!
-  No.

01:50:01.913 --> 01:50:03.783
Give me all the media!
Are you deaf?!

01:50:03.783 --> 01:50:06.753
Dressler, bring
the helicopter to the trench.

01:50:06.753 --> 01:50:07.952
- What about Ryder?
- Now!

01:50:07.952 --> 01:50:09.580
Now, about this date.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.154
Put it in the case, you numpty!

01:50:12.154 --> 01:50:13.485
Can we call it a date?

01:50:13.485 --> 01:50:16.521
I mean,
that's what it is, right?

01:50:16.521 --> 01:50:17.632
Such a moron!

01:50:18.558 --> 01:50:21.493
- Hurry up! God!
-  -Take it.

01:50:21.493 --> 01:50:23.330
- Gail, Gail, Gail.

01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:25.431
- Listen...
- Give me the recording, Gail.

01:50:25.431 --> 01:50:28.335
Darling, calm down.
Just come with me.

01:50:28.335 --> 01:50:30.843
We don't need
all this toxic masculinity,

01:50:30.843 --> 01:50:32.273
because we're the same,
you and me.

01:50:32.273 --> 01:50:34.110
You know, we're survivors.

01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:35.848
No, no, no, no.
I'm nothing like you.

01:50:35.848 --> 01:50:38.312
I don't want to be
presumptuous, I mean,

01:50:38.312 --> 01:50:41.018
but let's call a spade a spade.

01:50:41.018 --> 01:50:42.855
That's why I gave you the job.

01:50:42.855 --> 01:50:44.351
- Okay.
- Well, that and because

01:50:44.351 --> 01:50:47.662
you're so easily moldable,
you know?

01:50:48.522 --> 01:50:51.028
- Oh!
- Gail, just give me the case!

01:50:51.028 --> 01:50:52.898
This is a Gail Meyer production!

01:50:52.898 --> 01:50:54.526

01:50:59.663 --> 01:51:02.204
Oh, no, Big Red.

01:51:02.204 --> 01:51:04.206
I don't think
you're gonna make that one.

01:51:04.206 --> 01:51:06.538
- Stunts set!
-Stunts set!

01:51:06.538 --> 01:51:08.749
- Go!

01:51:21.423 --> 01:51:24.028

be taking the fall for this,

01:51:24.028 --> 01:51:29.099

Jody?

01:51:37.637 --> 01:51:40.374
Jody? -RYDER: Hey, hey!
That's for me! That's for me!

01:51:40.374 --> 01:51:42.079
- That's my helicopter!

01:51:42.079 --> 01:51:44.785

lost his mind!

01:51:58.625 --> 01:51:59.965

01:52:13.308 --> 01:52:15.442

Not again, dog.

01:52:16.819 --> 01:52:18.016
- Just stay there!

01:52:19.118 --> 01:52:21.855
Night-night, dog! You're dead.

01:52:32.659 --> 01:52:35.264

01:52:36.663 --> 01:52:40.170
Get in! Let's get out of here!

01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:41.776
Yeah, copy that.
Taking off now.

01:52:43.307 --> 01:52:44.735

01:52:44.735 --> 01:52:46.077

01:52:56.991 --> 01:52:59.024
- Whoa! Sh-- Whoa!
- Holy shit!

01:52:59.024 --> 01:53:01.455
- Lower the arm! I'm gonna jump.
- Okay.

01:53:01.455 --> 01:53:03.556
Okay, lower the arm.
Lower the arm.

01:53:07.628 --> 01:53:09.496
I have a plan!

01:53:09.496 --> 01:53:11.432
What is it?
What's-what's the plan?

01:53:11.432 --> 01:53:12.466
Get me to the helicopter.

01:53:12.466 --> 01:53:13.940
I'm gonna jump onto the skids,

01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.974
and then I'm gonna
beat the shit out of him.

01:53:14.974 --> 01:53:16.338
No, just-just get the recording.

01:53:30.552 --> 01:53:31.826
Go!

01:53:32.422 --> 01:53:33.520

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.829

01:53:43.906 --> 01:53:45.631
Just wondering,
you know, after this movie,

01:53:45.631 --> 01:53:48.634
and if I don't go to prison
and, you know, you're not busy,

01:53:48.634 --> 01:53:50.306
maybe we could go
to a beach somewhere.

01:53:50.306 --> 01:53:52.704

swimming costumes.

01:53:52.704 --> 01:53:54.882

Okay, sure. Yes.

01:53:58.743 --> 01:54:00.349
- Sound like a plan?
- It's a better plan than this.

01:54:00.349 --> 01:54:02.483
Okay, please be careful.

01:54:02.483 --> 01:54:04.122
Okay, swing him around. Go!

01:54:21.471 --> 01:54:23.570
God, get it under control!

01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:25.770
Get us out of here!

01:54:33.679 --> 01:54:35.087
No!

01:54:35.087 --> 01:54:37.089

01:56:06.673 --> 01:56:08.312

01:56:08.312 --> 01:56:10.611

stunt doubles I've ever had!
