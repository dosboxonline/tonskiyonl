All right, now remember,
we're trash,

00:34.001 --> 00:35.669
so no dressing rooms for us.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.630
The Griffins are proud
middle-of-the-aisle
try-on people.

00:39.423 --> 00:41.467
Take a look, I don't care.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.177
Brian, I found our costume!

00:43.177 --> 00:44.845
We're gonna be Sonny and Cher!

00:44.845 --> 00:46.555
And either one of us
could be Cher, I don't care--

00:46.555 --> 00:47.765
I guess I'll be Cher.

00:47.765 --> 00:49.099
How do you know
I don't already have plans

00:49.099 --> 00:51.143
-for Halloween?
-You do have plans.

00:51.143 --> 00:53.604
You're dressing as Sonny
and trick-or-treating with me.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.440
If you come near me,

00:56.440 --> 00:58.817
-you're saying you're okay
with getting hit!
-[both gasp]

00:58.817 --> 01:02.362
Yeah, everybody has a plan
until they see the husky kid

01:02.362 --> 01:05.074
in the Halloween store
going absolutely nuts

01:05.074 --> 01:06.325
with nunchucks!

01:06.325 --> 01:08.077
[yells]

01:12.247 --> 01:13.707
This pumpkin's huge!

01:13.707 --> 01:15.667
-How'd you get it so big?
-Giggity.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.544
You guys promise not to laugh?

01:17.544 --> 01:18.837
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yes.

01:18.837 --> 01:20.214
I wished for it.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.257
[laughing]

01:22.257 --> 01:23.675
I knew you guys would laugh,

01:23.675 --> 01:26.178
but I also tended to it
for months.

01:26.178 --> 01:28.263
My only question is, why?

01:28.263 --> 01:29.765
Every year, I enter Quahog's

01:29.765 --> 01:31.433
Great Pumpkin
Halloween Contest

01:31.433 --> 01:34.895
and get creamed by that
dang Patrick McCloskey.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.772
Guy's got the best soil
in town.

01:36.772 --> 01:38.148
He's over there
on the east side.

01:38.148 --> 01:39.566
You know what that means.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.776
I think you know we don't.

01:40.776 --> 01:42.903
Closer to the coast,
more moisture.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.404
Should really be two contests,

01:44.404 --> 01:46.156
one for each side of town.

01:46.156 --> 01:48.325
I think one's the right amount
of contests.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.493
Patrick McCloskey?

01:49.493 --> 01:51.036
Why do I know that name?

01:51.036 --> 01:52.996
Wait, weren't there
weird rumors about him
and Bonnie?

01:52.996 --> 01:54.331
No, it's just
the pumpkin thing.

01:58.043 --> 01:59.586
We are going to be
such a thing

01:59.586 --> 02:00.754
at trick-or-treating.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.839
I'd honestly be Sonny

02:01.839 --> 02:03.757
if I wasn't exactly
Cher's size.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.217
I'm going to take
this costume off.

02:05.217 --> 02:07.010
Not yet, it's time for choreo!

02:07.010 --> 02:09.096
That's choreography.
Did you know that?

02:09.096 --> 02:10.931
Stewie, I can't just spend
all day doing--

02:10.931 --> 02:12.933
So it's rock left,
rock right,

02:12.933 --> 02:15.310
right elbow into chest,
half-air bump,

02:15.310 --> 02:17.938
left elbow into chest,
half-air bump.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.189
Say it with me.

02:19.189 --> 02:21.066
[together]
Rock left, rock right,

02:21.066 --> 02:23.652
right elbow into chest,
half-air bump.

02:23.652 --> 02:25.571
You're off tempo.

02:25.571 --> 02:27.322
-Rock left, rock right...
-Left... right...

02:27.322 --> 02:29.950
-...right elbow into chest,
half-air bump.
-Chest... half...

02:29.950 --> 02:31.577
-Bump.
-You're off tempo, again.

02:31.577 --> 02:33.412
I'm starting to think
you don't really want this.

02:33.412 --> 02:34.580
I don't want this.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.290
Brian, do you know
how many Puerto Rican men

02:36.290 --> 02:38.792
came here in giant sweatpants
to audition for me?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.377
You're taking this too far.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.671
I'm not getting bossed around
by you for the next two days.

02:42.671 --> 02:44.840
Well, now you know
how Cher felt about Sonny.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.842
[sighs] I knew it was just
a matter of time

02:46.842 --> 02:48.468
until we became
the two of them.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.012
You look ridiculous,
by the way.

02:50.012 --> 02:51.221
How dare you?

02:51.221 --> 02:53.974
Rupert thinks I look amazing.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.185
Well, great.
Rupert can be Sonny
because I'm done.

02:56.185 --> 02:57.478
I'm not taking you
trick-or-treating.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.770
I'm going to hang out
with my friends.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.772
Oh, your "friends," huh?
Name one.

03:00.772 --> 03:03.066
-Shut up.
-Oh, yeah, "Shut Up,"
great guy.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.776
I hate you!

03:04.776 --> 03:06.486
God, Brian's such a jerk.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.197
"Have Rupert be Sonny."

03:08.197 --> 03:10.407
You know what? Maybe I will.

03:10.407 --> 03:11.492
And here's your stupid

03:11.492 --> 03:13.410
very-real-feeling
mustache back.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.204
Where do you even get
something like this?

03:15.204 --> 03:17.039
Don't worry
about where I got it.

03:17.039 --> 03:18.248
[Tom] Hello?

03:18.248 --> 03:19.291
Where am I?

03:20.042 --> 03:21.043
Is anybody there?

03:24.004 --> 03:26.632
[screaming] No!

03:32.054 --> 03:34.097
You guys
are big fact guys, right?

03:34.097 --> 03:37.017
I read Native Americans used
every part of the pumpkin.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.229
It provided many gifts.
Clothing, soap, tools.

03:40.229 --> 03:42.439
Pumpkins were even honored
as relatives

03:42.439 --> 03:44.816
and paid tribute
to through songs,

03:44.816 --> 03:46.443
dance, and prayers.

03:46.443 --> 03:50.447
I am 100% sure
it's the buffalo
to which you are referring.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.532
Let's see
how the little guy's doing.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.161
A dark-eyed junco?

03:56.161 --> 03:57.913
That's a pumpkin
death sentence!

03:57.913 --> 03:59.122
Scram, scram!

03:59.122 --> 04:00.457
Get out of there! Bonnie?

04:00.457 --> 04:03.460
[over intercom]
You out there? Get the broom!

04:03.460 --> 04:05.379
What were we talking about?
Pumpkins?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.047
Shut up about the pumpkin!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.715
I might give Bon a quick call.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.467
Make sure she knows
she's on bird duty.

04:11.927 --> 04:14.554
I apologize for my outburst.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.056
It's something I'm working on.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.557
No apology necessary.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.102
I've had about all I can take
of this stupid pumpkin.

04:20.102 --> 04:21.853
Hey, what if we hid
Joe's pumpkin

04:21.853 --> 04:24.189
before it gets picked up
for the fair tomorrow morning?

04:24.189 --> 04:26.358
-I'm way in.
-Great idea, Peter.

04:26.358 --> 04:28.277
It's just a standard plan
of attack.

04:28.277 --> 04:30.779
Something I picked up
when I served at Fort Bragg.

04:30.779 --> 04:33.365
I once hit three homers
in a wiffle ball game.

04:33.365 --> 04:34.783
Why are you telling me this?

04:34.783 --> 04:35.909
Fort Bragg.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.869
You're going
to the war tomorrow.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.913
-Where is it?
-Afghanistan.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.165
I've been there,
like, four times, no big deal.

04:42.874 --> 04:44.293
[thunder crashes]

04:52.884 --> 04:55.304
All right, Rupert,
prepare to be brought to life

04:55.304 --> 04:57.264
to be my Sonny for Halloween.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.515
Oop, almost forgot.

05:02.394 --> 05:04.896
And finally,
this metal-studded dog collar

05:04.896 --> 05:06.106
to conduct electricity,

05:06.106 --> 05:07.691
and not because it's
my biggest kink.

05:12.696 --> 05:14.448
[Meg]
Did the Internet just go out?

05:14.448 --> 05:15.699
It won't be long!

05:15.699 --> 05:17.326
[Chris] Yeah, it's out.

05:17.326 --> 05:19.661
Guys, you can go,
like, two seconds
without the Internet!

05:21.246 --> 05:22.622
[electricity crackling]

05:25.250 --> 05:26.460
[thunder crashing]

05:30.339 --> 05:31.965
[crackling intensifies]

05:46.063 --> 05:47.314
It's not alive.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.483
It's not alive!

05:53.403 --> 05:54.863
[Chris]
Internet's back for me.

05:54.863 --> 05:57.866
[Meg] Me too.
Reebok.com, baby!

05:57.866 --> 05:59.117
[sighs]

06:01.203 --> 06:02.287
[thunder crashes]

06:02.287 --> 06:04.122
One, two, three!

06:04.122 --> 06:06.583
[all grunting]

06:06.583 --> 06:08.543
-Where are we taking this?
-I don't know.

06:08.543 --> 06:10.420
What?
I thought you had a plan!

06:10.420 --> 06:12.464
Yeah, the plan,
which everyone loved,

06:12.464 --> 06:13.840
was to hide the pumpkin.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.009
Oh, for crying out loud.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.719
Am I the only one
who can make plans?

06:17.719 --> 06:19.429
I have decision fatigue.

06:20.138 --> 06:21.556
-[both gasp]
-Uh-oh.

06:21.556 --> 06:22.974
We wrecked Joe's pumpkin.

06:22.974 --> 06:24.643
And my sneakers!

06:24.643 --> 06:25.894
[thunder crashes]

06:26.728 --> 06:28.021
Cleveland, are you--

06:28.021 --> 06:29.231
Are those Yeezys?

06:29.231 --> 06:30.649
They're cheaper now.

06:33.568 --> 06:34.569
[thunder crashes]

06:35.529 --> 06:36.530
Rupert?

06:37.239 --> 06:38.240
Rupert?

06:39.366 --> 06:41.201
Rupert, you awake?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.494
Oh, good, you are.

06:42.494 --> 06:43.745
Yes, it's about Brian.

06:43.745 --> 06:44.996
He was so mean.

06:44.996 --> 06:47.624
I can't believe he just
ditched me on Halloween.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.001
He's my best friend,
and this is how he treats me.

06:50.001 --> 06:51.086
I hate him.

06:51.086 --> 06:52.587
Seriously,
I wish he were dead.

06:52.587 --> 06:54.339
I mean it,
no takesies-backsies.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.174
Good night, Rupert.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.677
Rupert?

06:58.677 --> 06:59.845
Rupert, you awake?

06:59.845 --> 07:00.971
Oh, good, you're awake.

07:00.971 --> 07:01.972
Good night.

07:03.014 --> 07:04.015
[snores]

07:07.894 --> 07:09.521
[thunder crashes]

07:09.521 --> 07:11.898
Dear Stewie,
you've given me life,

07:11.898 --> 07:14.276
and some would say
I'm indebted to you.

07:14.276 --> 07:16.361
Well, I don't know
if all that's true,

07:16.361 --> 07:20.282
but you've got me,
and, baby, I've got you.

07:20.282 --> 07:23.702
[laughing]

07:23.702 --> 07:26.663
And now to fulfill your wish,

07:26.663 --> 07:30.459
I must kill Brian.

07:30.459 --> 07:34.379
But first, I must kill
this bag of Doritos.

07:34.379 --> 07:37.174
[announcer]
Family Guy. It was either this
or we fire three writers.

07:47.490 --> 07:48.658
Step aside.

07:48.658 --> 07:50.660
Now, let's remember,
it's just a pumpkin.

07:50.660 --> 07:51.745
[gun cocks]

07:54.039 --> 07:56.416
No, no, no!
We can put it back together.

07:56.416 --> 07:58.043
Are you telling me
you can do

07:58.043 --> 08:00.545
what the Humpty Dumpty
crew couldn't?

08:00.545 --> 08:02.672
I-- I never got
to the end of that.

08:02.672 --> 08:04.633
And you have no king's horses,

08:04.633 --> 08:07.260
and they had
all the King's horses.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.388
I'm not sure how much horses
can help fix a broken egg guy.

08:10.388 --> 08:12.599
Yeah, good luck
with those hooves.

08:12.599 --> 08:13.767
[groans]

08:13.767 --> 08:15.060
Well, I'm finished.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.562
May as well give McCloskey
the trophy now.

08:17.562 --> 08:19.439
You know,
the damage is on the bottom.

08:19.439 --> 08:21.900
We can just shovel
the rest of the goop
back in and prop it up.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.779
We can't just scoop 307 pounds
of pumpkin guts in there.

08:25.779 --> 08:28.031
[horn honking]

08:31.993 --> 08:34.579
307 pounds is my exact weight.

08:34.579 --> 08:36.623
This is crazy, but I think
I could slide in

08:36.623 --> 08:37.916
through the hole
in the bottom.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.709
Then I could just sit in there
for a few hours,

08:39.709 --> 08:41.419
and maybe you can
still win the contest.

08:41.419 --> 08:42.754
You'd do that for me?

08:42.754 --> 08:44.172
I broke it. I'll fix it.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.049
Plus, I want to beat McCloskey
for you.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.259
I heard about him and Bonnie.

08:47.259 --> 08:48.718
I don't know
what people are hearing.

08:48.718 --> 08:50.178
It's just pumpkin stuff
with us.

08:54.349 --> 08:57.185
Welcome to the Quahog
Great Pumpkin Contest.

08:57.185 --> 08:58.520
We're going to start today

08:58.520 --> 09:00.271
with the pumpkin pie
eating event.

09:00.271 --> 09:02.440
Peter Griffin is
our reigning champion.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.402
Peter, come on up and accept
this Pie to the City.

09:05.402 --> 09:07.570
[Peter] Joe, I need
to come out for a minute.

09:07.570 --> 09:09.114
It's too risky, Peter.

09:09.114 --> 09:11.574
The Pie to the City
enables the bearer

09:11.574 --> 09:13.743
to go to any establishment
with pie

09:13.743 --> 09:16.663
and get a free pie
at any time.

09:16.663 --> 09:18.123
Sorry, bud.

09:18.123 --> 09:19.374
We'll get you pie later.

09:26.631 --> 09:28.466

-[tires screeching]

09:35.598 --> 09:37.017
[spits]

09:40.228 --> 09:41.479
-Who is that?
-Who was that?

09:41.479 --> 09:42.689
That's the king.

09:42.689 --> 09:43.815
That's McCloskey.

09:43.815 --> 09:45.650
He's allowed to just park
on the grass?

09:45.650 --> 09:46.901
They'll ask him to move.

09:46.901 --> 09:48.236
That's what they did
last year.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.284
Stewie thinks
I have no friends.

09:54.284 --> 09:55.493
Then what are all these?

09:56.411 --> 09:57.871
Hello, Brian.

09:57.871 --> 10:00.582
Enjoy your last call.

10:00.582 --> 10:01.750
[ringing]

10:03.585 --> 10:05.045
Hello?

10:05.045 --> 10:07.922
Sanfo, what do we got going on
for All Hallows' Eve?

10:07.922 --> 10:09.007
Hang sesh?

10:09.007 --> 10:10.091
Who is this?

10:10.091 --> 10:11.468
Bri-guy, from the line.

10:11.468 --> 10:12.552
What line?

10:12.552 --> 10:13.970
"What line," he says.

10:13.970 --> 10:15.305
Top Gun: Maverick.

10:15.305 --> 10:18.349
Uh, dude, that was,
like, three years ago.

10:18.349 --> 10:19.434
Ha! What're we
gettin' into tonight,

10:19.434 --> 10:21.436
you ol' bull shark?

10:21.436 --> 10:22.812
I don't know, man.

10:22.812 --> 10:25.106
I might go
to the Quahog Cemetery
outdoor movie.

10:25.106 --> 10:26.191
Love it. Should we get

10:26.191 --> 10:28.401
the Dime Boys involved
is the question?

10:28.401 --> 10:30.612
Hey, while I got ya,
let me show you my yard.

10:30.612 --> 10:32.655
So much potench.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.532
Ugh. "Potench."

10:34.532 --> 10:36.367
Now I want to kill him twice.

10:41.164 --> 10:42.248
Look at him.

10:42.248 --> 10:43.625
He's so cool.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.543
[Peter] I want to see him
so bad.

10:48.046 --> 10:49.214
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

10:49.214 --> 10:51.925
Look who it is,
"Second Place" Swanson.

10:51.925 --> 10:53.426
That nickname
doesn't make sense

10:53.426 --> 10:55.428
because one year
I was sixth place.

10:55.428 --> 10:57.305
Feel stupid now, McCloskey?

10:57.305 --> 10:59.849
Let me get a closer look
at your pumpkin.

10:59.849 --> 11:01.976
Could barely see it
from over there.

11:01.976 --> 11:04.020
[Peter] Ha, classic McCloskey.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.647
-What was that?
-What?

11:05.647 --> 11:08.650
All I hear are whispers
from all the pumpkin bloggers

11:08.650 --> 11:10.985
saying McCloskey's reign
is over.

11:10.985 --> 11:12.070
Good news.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.405
When your pumpkin loses,

11:13.405 --> 11:14.864
you can still use it
as a centerpiece

11:14.864 --> 11:16.407
at Thanksgiving. [laughs]

11:16.407 --> 11:18.743
Provided you have
a small enough table.

11:18.743 --> 11:20.161
-[grunts]
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:20.161 --> 11:22.080
It's not worth it.
None of this is.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.331
I wish I stayed home.

11:26.584 --> 11:30.755
And this year's Quahog
Great Pumpkin winner is...

11:30.755 --> 11:32.006
[drum roll]

11:34.217 --> 11:36.136
It's just pumpkin stuff, Joe.

11:36.136 --> 11:37.262
Oh, good.

11:37.262 --> 11:38.930
See, fellas? Pumpkin stuff.

11:38.930 --> 11:40.849
Joe Swanson!

11:40.849 --> 11:42.934
-Yeah! Mwah.
-Ugh!

11:42.934 --> 11:45.103
Better luck next year,
McCloskey.

11:45.854 --> 11:46.938
What are they doing?

11:48.231 --> 11:50.483
All the Pumpkin County winners
are entered

11:50.483 --> 11:52.527
in the State Halloween Contest
in Providence.

11:52.527 --> 11:55.613
Do you know anything about
regional pumpkin contests?

11:55.613 --> 11:58.408
Oh, suck my bumpy gourd,
McCloskey.

11:58.408 --> 11:59.617
Your what?

11:59.617 --> 12:01.619
My bumpy little orange,
green, and yellow

12:01.619 --> 12:04.164
Gonzo-nose-shaped gourd.

12:04.164 --> 12:05.248
Stop describing it.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.293
[Peter] Are we driving?

12:08.293 --> 12:10.086
I don't have a seat belt.

12:10.086 --> 12:11.421
[kids] Trick-or-treat!

12:16.926 --> 12:19.429
Weird. That kid looks like
your teddy bear.

12:19.429 --> 12:20.847
Except he's holding
a big knife

12:20.847 --> 12:23.141
and has a present-day
Anthony Kiedis costume.

12:26.269 --> 12:28.479
That's not present-day
Anthony Kiedis.

12:28.479 --> 12:29.772
That's Sonny Bono.

12:29.772 --> 12:31.524
Oh, my God, it worked!

12:31.524 --> 12:33.860
I made life! Yay!

12:35.320 --> 12:37.155
Rupert, you're alive!

12:37.155 --> 12:38.531
Thanks to you.

12:38.531 --> 12:41.201
This is amazing! Oh,
we have so much to talk about.

12:41.201 --> 12:42.744
But first, candy.

12:42.744 --> 12:44.329
I can't wait to join you,

12:44.329 --> 12:48.499
right after I find
and kill Brian, babe.

12:48.499 --> 12:49.626
Wait, what?

12:49.626 --> 12:52.587
Remember?
"I wish Brian were dead."

12:52.587 --> 12:54.297
Oh, I was just angry
for a second.

12:54.297 --> 12:56.341
But forget all that.
You're alive!

12:56.341 --> 12:57.592
Let's trick-or-treat.

12:57.592 --> 12:58.760
Of course.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.511
Once I kill Brian.

13:00.511 --> 13:02.138
Come on, Rupert.
Don't be silly.

13:02.138 --> 13:03.348
I'm not mad anymore.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.141
Actually, I like being
a solo act.

13:05.141 --> 13:08.686
I got an Oscar and, like,
100 hot young boyfriends
ahead of me.

13:08.686 --> 13:11.314
Gonna do a fishnet dance
on an aircraft carrier,

13:11.314 --> 13:13.483
remind our boys in white
what they're fightin' for.

13:13.483 --> 13:14.984
Anyway,
you don't have to kill him.

13:14.984 --> 13:17.403
But you said,
"No takesies-backsies."

13:19.364 --> 13:21.115
Rupert, where did you go?

13:21.115 --> 13:23.326
Oh, my God,
I have to save Brian!

13:25.078 --> 13:27.205
Mr. Herbert,
you're trick-or-treating?

13:27.205 --> 13:29.082
Oh, I use Halloween
to take care of

13:29.082 --> 13:31.125
a little yearly housekeeping.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.293
[giggling]

13:32.293 --> 13:33.503
[doorbell rings]

13:33.503 --> 13:34.587
Trick-or-treat!

13:34.587 --> 13:36.673
I'm a registered sex offender.

13:41.469 --> 13:42.470
Brian!

13:43.054 --> 13:44.305
Brian!

13:44.305 --> 13:45.848
Where could he be?

13:45.848 --> 13:47.058
Hey, Cher!

13:47.058 --> 13:49.018
Hey, guys!

13:49.018 --> 13:50.478
I'm putting this on Instagram!

13:51.396 --> 13:52.897
Well, this is a big hit.

13:52.897 --> 13:54.774
I can't stop smiling.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.401
Instagram! Of course!

13:56.401 --> 13:57.777
Brian doesn't have
the confidence

13:57.777 --> 13:59.404
not to shove
every sad little thing

13:59.404 --> 14:00.822
he does down our throats.

14:00.822 --> 14:02.031
Bingo!

14:02.031 --> 14:03.950
He's going to watch
an '80s horror boob movie

14:03.950 --> 14:05.118
at the cemetery.

14:05.118 --> 14:07.245
"Gonna be cool
to see them so big."

14:07.245 --> 14:09.247
Hashtag big screen boobs.

14:09.247 --> 14:11.916
"Waiting on my guy Sanfo
with the provisions."

14:11.916 --> 14:15.003
Parenthetical,
"All the Jameson, please.
LOL."

14:15.003 --> 14:16.671
Ugh, what a mess.

14:16.671 --> 14:18.881
[Rupert] Shall we split a cab?

14:18.881 --> 14:21.092
-[yelps]
-It's nice he's
at the cemetery.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.677
Less clean up.

14:22.677 --> 14:23.678
[phone dings]

14:27.473 --> 14:28.683
God, that's awful.

14:34.897 --> 14:36.566
Peter's been in that pumpkin
all day.

14:36.566 --> 14:38.026
We gotta find him
and get him out.

14:39.569 --> 14:42.280
It's going to take us hours
with all these pumpkins.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.406
-Peter!
-[Peter] Yeah?

14:43.406 --> 14:45.199
-Oh, wow.
-Can I come out?

14:45.199 --> 14:46.409
I should be at work.

14:46.409 --> 14:47.910
Yeah, let's get you
out of there.

14:47.910 --> 14:49.287
Well, well, well.

14:49.287 --> 14:50.830
"Miracle-Grow" Joe.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.582
McCloskey,
what are you doing here?

14:52.582 --> 14:54.500
I saved my wristband
from last year.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.127
They didn't change the color.

14:56.127 --> 14:58.254
I didn't ask how you got in.

14:58.254 --> 14:59.881
Well,
something doesn't add up.

14:59.881 --> 15:02.592
Last year,
your pumpkin was 18 pounds.

15:02.592 --> 15:05.762
And this year, it's 307?

15:05.762 --> 15:08.222
Seems like
a disproportionate step up.

15:08.222 --> 15:09.432
But what do I know?

15:09.432 --> 15:12.477
Just almost every
pumpkin thing there is.

15:12.477 --> 15:13.853
Get lost, McCloskey.

15:13.853 --> 15:16.356
Oh, ho-ho-ho!
No, I'm sticking around.

15:16.356 --> 15:17.982
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

15:17.982 --> 15:21.903
[Peter] Yeah, now I'm kind of
wondering myself.

15:21.903 --> 15:24.405
[announcer] Hello, hipsters
and newly-sober people

15:24.405 --> 15:27.033
who ran out of
seltzer flavors to try.

15:27.033 --> 15:29.285
The movie will start soon.

15:29.285 --> 15:31.662
Do you mind if I scoot
your blanket over a bit?

15:31.662 --> 15:32.914
You're on my dad's grave,

15:32.914 --> 15:34.457
and I'd like to leave
these flowers.

15:34.457 --> 15:36.376
I totally get it
from your perspective,

15:36.376 --> 15:38.836
but Sanfo should be here
in uno momento,

15:38.836 --> 15:40.963
and there's a chance
the Dime Boys may roll,

15:40.963 --> 15:42.131
so, yeah, no.

15:46.302 --> 15:47.762
Hello.

15:47.762 --> 15:49.347
Do you mind if I sit?

15:49.347 --> 15:52.433
Whoa, a kid dressed as a bear
dressed as Sonny Bono?

15:52.433 --> 15:53.518
That's so weird.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.144
Oh, how so?

15:55.144 --> 15:57.105
Just-- I was supposed to go
as that.

15:57.105 --> 15:58.439
Well, why didn't you?

15:58.439 --> 16:00.483
Maybe somebody
was counting on you.

16:00.483 --> 16:02.068
Oh, that's not him.

16:02.068 --> 16:03.861
Sorry, bud.
I'm sorta keeping an eye out
for my friends.

16:03.861 --> 16:05.488
They'll probably need help
with the YETI.

16:05.488 --> 16:08.199
It's the big one. Not cheap,
but heirloom quality.

16:08.199 --> 16:12.829
You know, to have a friend,
you must first be a friend.

16:12.829 --> 16:15.706
And you haven't been
a very good one, have you?

16:15.706 --> 16:16.791
Hey, you got it, Sonny.

16:16.791 --> 16:18.042
Hey, I'm gonna run
to the bathroom.

16:18.042 --> 16:20.002
If you see three guys
dressed as Anchorman

16:20.002 --> 16:21.462
scream-quoting Will Ferrell,

16:21.462 --> 16:23.339
tell 'em this is the spot.

16:23.339 --> 16:26.551
Oh, this is the spot,
all right.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.845
The spot to die.

16:29.637 --> 16:30.847
[Peter crying]

16:30.847 --> 16:32.056
We gotta get
Peter out of there.

16:32.056 --> 16:33.182
He's starting to lose it.

16:33.182 --> 16:34.976
Something is off
with this pumpkin.

16:34.976 --> 16:36.853
Don't hate me
'cause you ain't me.

16:36.853 --> 16:39.730
McCloskey said that to me
last year and now I say it.

16:39.730 --> 16:42.483
I have to go to the bathroom
more than the pail in here!

16:42.483 --> 16:44.444
-[judges gasp]
-Mr. Swanson,

16:44.444 --> 16:45.903
what is going on here?

16:45.903 --> 16:47.780
[sighs] I'm sorry.

16:47.780 --> 16:48.948
I've disgraced--

16:48.948 --> 16:50.408
[man]
I also have to go
to the bathroom

16:50.408 --> 16:51.993
more than the pail in here!

16:51.993 --> 16:53.828
Who is that?

16:53.828 --> 16:55.788
[together]
We all have to go
to the bathroom

16:55.788 --> 16:57.623
more than the pail in here!

16:57.623 --> 16:59.917
My wife made me volunteer
for this job.

16:59.917 --> 17:01.335
I'm not really sure
what to do.

17:01.335 --> 17:03.421
Maybe we just vote
on the fattest guy?

17:03.421 --> 17:05.047
This seems mean now.

17:05.047 --> 17:06.757
How'd you know I was cheating?

17:06.757 --> 17:08.092
The truth is...

17:08.092 --> 17:10.636
[sighs] there's no way
to win this contest clean.

17:10.636 --> 17:12.680
No real pumpkin
is ever over 20 pounds.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.056
But yours always are.

17:14.056 --> 17:16.809
My fat son sits in mine
every year.

17:16.809 --> 17:19.645
All these years,
I thought giant pumpkins

17:19.645 --> 17:21.189
were just full of seeds.

17:21.189 --> 17:22.648
Forget it, Joe.

17:22.648 --> 17:24.233
It's Pumpkin Town.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.321
[♪ moody jazz music playing]

17:30.948 --> 17:32.617
[engine revving]

17:36.954 --> 17:38.581
I gotta put
some thought to this,

17:38.581 --> 17:40.875
but I think I may be in love
with that guy.

17:45.338 --> 17:46.881
Have you seen a dog
with a bear

17:46.881 --> 17:48.299
in a Sonny Bono costume?

17:48.299 --> 17:49.550
[laughs]

17:49.550 --> 17:51.427
No, nothing like that.

17:51.427 --> 17:52.720
Just a dog with a bear

17:52.720 --> 17:54.388
in a present-day
Anthony Kiedis costume.

17:57.725 --> 17:59.352
That's him!
Which way did they go?

18:05.358 --> 18:07.485
Oh, God, I'm too late.

18:07.485 --> 18:08.611
You're not too late!

18:08.611 --> 18:10.112
But by the time
I start helping,

18:10.112 --> 18:11.364
don't you think
it'll be too late?

18:11.364 --> 18:13.533
Not at all. Help!

18:24.085 --> 18:25.586
You should go.

18:25.586 --> 18:28.256
I don't think
you'll want to see
what happens next.

18:28.256 --> 18:30.550
I command you
not to kill Brian.

18:30.550 --> 18:33.636
Dear, dear, Stewie,
don't you see it?

18:33.636 --> 18:35.179
You only animated me to life

18:35.179 --> 18:37.765
when Brian said
he wouldn't be Sonny.

18:37.765 --> 18:41.644
You turn to me only when
Brian's mean to you.

18:41.644 --> 18:43.938
I'm always second to him.

18:43.938 --> 18:45.022
Well, that's not true.

18:45.022 --> 18:46.148
Isn't it?

18:46.148 --> 18:48.776
Do you know
my name's not even Rupert?

18:48.776 --> 18:49.944
It's Jerry.

18:49.944 --> 18:52.029
Ugh, I've been hanging out
with a Jerry?

18:52.029 --> 18:55.491
But once Brian's gone,
I'll finally be first.

18:55.491 --> 18:59.287
You're one and only
best friend.

and I'll let you go.

19:19.307 --> 19:21.350
[choking] I can't do that.

19:21.350 --> 19:26.480
In that case,
you leave me no choice.

Oh, hey, man.

19:50.129 --> 19:51.589
How much did you hear?

19:51.589 --> 19:53.591
You brought your bear to life
and told him to kill me?

19:53.591 --> 19:55.343
Damn, I was hoping
you missed that.

19:55.343 --> 19:59.013
Also, you chose me
and saved my life.

You're my best friend, Bri.

20:00.931 --> 20:03.100
I'm really sorry
I put you through this.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.186
Eh, I was pretty selfish, too.

20:05.186 --> 20:07.104
I should have made time
to take my best friend

I'm your best friend?

You're pretty much
my only friend.

20:12.902 --> 20:15.112
What about Sanfo
and the Dime Boys?

20:15.112 --> 20:18.532
Honestly, I think Sanfo's just
using me for my sick yard.

20:18.532 --> 20:20.242
Happy Halloween, Bri,

20:20.242 --> 20:21.827
you total loon.

20:21.827 --> 20:23.245
Happy Halloween, Stewie.

20:29.460 --> 20:32.630
Man, that yard is going to be
the place to be this summer.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.882
[Stewie]
Maybe this is the summer
I get back into croquet.

20:34.882 --> 20:36.050
We do have the space.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.593
[Brian] Yeah, lot of potench.

20:37.593 --> 20:38.594
[Stewie groans] Ugh.

20:45.393 --> 20:47.353
Oh, I know what you want.

20:48.062 --> 20:49.522
Here you go, sweetie.

is all dry and good as new.

20:56.153 --> 20:57.738
but that should come back
in time.

20:57.738 --> 21:00.533
Oh, my God, Rupert,
you would not believe
what happened.

21:00.533 --> 21:03.577
I animated you to life,
and then you decided to kill--

21:03.577 --> 21:05.538
Yes, to life! Me!

21:05.538 --> 21:08.582
I did it, and then you decided
to kill Brian, because--

21:08.582 --> 21:10.126
No, we do not wish
he was dead.

21:10.126 --> 21:12.086
Not anymore, at least.
And then...

do they talk about?
