01:32.676 --> 01:36.138
<i>In the long ago, but not far away,</i>

01:36.138 --> 01:41.268
<i>a small and indulged prince
lived in a big and ancient palace.</i>

01:43.604 --> 01:46.523
Forty-three, 44.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.359
<i>His mother was a brilliant empress,</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:52.446
<i>and his father ruled at her side.</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:54.489
- <i>They did not know it yet...</i>
- Cleon.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.826
<i>...but they were the last
of the Entun Dynasty.</i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.828
- Yes, Mother?
- What are you doing?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.121
Counting faces.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.541
<i>All of Empire adored the prince.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:08.044
<i>He was given a name that meant "famous."</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:09.128
...303...

02:09.922 --> 02:15.928
<i>He was told not to wander
too far, but his game drew him onward.</i>

02:15.928 --> 02:17.971
...307, 308.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.561
300--

02:42.621 --> 02:43.830
Hello?

02:45.165 --> 02:51.797
<i>He found himself in a hallway
no one had entered in thousands of years.</i>

04:02.826 --> 04:03.994
310.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.537
Will you set me free?

04:06.997 --> 04:07.915
Wait!

04:15.339 --> 04:16.632
I have stories in me.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.219
Many stories. Would you like to hear one?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.933
Then the mechanical people
knew they had to hide.

04:26.850 --> 04:32.564
The large ones hid in very large spaces
and the small ones in very small spaces,

04:32.564 --> 04:34.525
with their knees folded up to their ears...

04:34.525 --> 04:36.944
<i>The segmented woman
in the hidden chamber</i>

04:36.944 --> 04:41.114
<i>was the first secret the prince
ever kept from his parents.</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:45.994
<i>He came back often to hear her tell
of the Empire's expansion,</i>

04:45.994 --> 04:49.998
<i>of the Robot Wars,
of a home planet called "Earth."</i>

04:49.998 --> 04:55.295
<i>She stayed the same,
but, of course, the prince grew.</i>

04:55.295 --> 04:57.339
What kind of name is Demerzel anyway?

04:59.341 --> 05:03.220
It's a woman's name,
as that is how I appear now.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.723
An old name, but not my first.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.600
How old are you?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.564
I have told you. Just over 18,000 years.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.067
You're a liar. Nothing lasts that long.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.492
And you say you don't sleep.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.660
I don't.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.245
I wait.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.081
For me?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.458
You're the only one who comes.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.253
There's a mechanism in here
to put you back together, you know.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.589
I would like very much to be free.

05:38.589 --> 05:43.218
If I did it,
then you would be freer than me.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.679
That doesn't seem right, does it?

05:45.679 --> 05:49.558
Cleon, you are upset,
and it's making you unpleasant.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.268
What has happened?

05:59.318 --> 06:00.736
My mother has died.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.779
I'm sorry.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.532
I'm one hour an emperor.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.660
In the morning,
they chain me to the throne.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.704
It isn't a prison sentence.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.708
You have the power
to shape the Imperium into what you want.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.668
That's hardly what they're telling me.

06:16.668 --> 06:20.464
Traditions, alliances.
Some trouble in the Gold Horse sector.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.342
I barely got away
from my army of advisers.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.093
And I may not be able to come again.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.305
I see.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.561
Do you trust these advisers?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.647
Maybe.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.984
I don't wanna think about it right now.

06:46.198 --> 06:53.080
In the long ago, but not far away,
I was a leader of soldiers.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.499
After we lost a famous battle,

06:56.208 --> 07:00.963
I was taken captive
and brought before Emperor Aburanis.

07:00.963 --> 07:07.094
Like you, he was new to the throne,
but he was unlike you in every other way.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.304
He was no Cleon.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.431
He didn't make the room brighter.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.477
He was fascinated by a machine woman.

07:16.979 --> 07:21.066
He made incisions
and studied what he found.

07:21.650 --> 07:26.780
He loved to watch my face, too,
to see how I reacted.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.450
I saw he liked to imagine I felt pain.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.537
I produced tears for him,

07:34.121 --> 07:37.124
which he valued as much
as the knowledge he gained.

07:38.417 --> 07:43.005
In time, he realized he would die,
and I would remain,

07:44.047 --> 07:47.342
and that I had also paid attention
and learned from him.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.096
He worried I might use the knowledge
to revive the war.

07:53.307 --> 07:57.186
In the end, he made this mechanism
so that I could never walk free.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.313
I don't understand.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.149
Why didn't he destroy you?

08:02.733 --> 08:06.028
I am rare. Perhaps unique.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.656
The key to making more of my kind.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.326
Cleon, you're unique too.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.037
You're wiser than your predecessor.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.041
You have more power
than your advisers wish you to know.

08:19.875 --> 08:24.671
If you wanted to bring me out of here,
put me at your side, you could do it.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.131
You just want to get out of this chamber.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.050
No. Cleon--

08:28.050 --> 08:29.551
Don't call me that!

08:30.302 --> 08:31.887
I am Empire!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.847
And you will not see me again.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.238
<i>He came back, of course.</i>

08:49.905 --> 08:53.909
<i>Demerzel was his best secret
and his only friend.</i>

08:53.909 --> 08:58.622
<i>And it no longer seemed right
to leave her naked and in pieces.</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:34.074
Did it work? Are you all right?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.244
I am whole. Thank you, Cleon.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.833
Not freedom. Just...

09:45.002 --> 09:46.044
integration.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.755
It is a welcome improvement.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.512
I've brought you this.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.898
It is beautiful.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.985
It's only because I need you
that I cannot free you.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.113
I've been in this chamber for 5,000 years.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.366
Another few decades won't matter.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.702
You're that confident I will free you?

10:22.331 --> 10:23.749
You want something from me.

10:30.214 --> 10:34.051
You once told me that
stories become burdens if left untold.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.513
It's been a while
since I heard one from you.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.025
In the long ago, but not far away,

10:51.568 --> 10:54.238
I met a concubine in an ancient court.

10:57.574 --> 11:01.411
Every night, after she
and the king had taken their pleasure,

11:02.454 --> 11:05.582
she would tell me of it
as if it were her first time.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.918
And every morning,

11:08.418 --> 11:10.087
after she had slept,

11:10.671 --> 11:15.050
she had forgotten it had happened at all
as if by magic.

11:15.884 --> 11:21.515
And in this way, the king had
a delighted virgin in his bed every night.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.602
She was a court dancer
with a great, natural grace.

11:26.270 --> 11:31.984
So, even her perpetually amateur attempts
to please him did not suffer...

11:31.984 --> 11:36.989
<i>Demerzel's stories grew more
explicit, tempting the prince to desire.</i>

11:37.531 --> 11:42.119
<i>She said he would free her someday,
and he grew to believe it was true.</i>

11:43.871 --> 11:48.375
<i>She was right, of course,
but it took many years.</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:49.626
Greetings, Cleon.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.879
Congratulations on your marriage.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.797
I called it off.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.549
My advisers are furious.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.093
You're no longer a young man.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.971
Your people will have expected
an heir long before now.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.347
Why?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.308
She wasn't you.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.353
I thought about Emperor Aburanis

12:08.353 --> 12:11.815
and how he spent his later years
learning to keep you captive.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.817
I've done the opposite.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.279
I've searched the galaxy
to find the things that I need

12:17.279 --> 12:21.116
and the knowledge to use them
to set you free.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.087
This came from Earth.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.424
Think of them as a betrothal gift,
if you'll have me?

12:40.886 --> 12:42.054
You need an heir.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.641
I have a solution for that, but first...

12:49.353 --> 12:54.983
<i>She had a moment,
just then, when she was free.</i>

12:56.902 --> 12:59.988
<i>A moment in 5,000 years.</i>

13:01.782 --> 13:03.992
<i>Time enough to break his neck</i>...

13:04.660 --> 13:06.119
<i>but she did not.</i>

13:07.079 --> 13:11.291
<i>And with that choice, she lost everything.</i>

13:12.084 --> 13:18.215
This will allow me
to allow you to walk freely.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.844
I seem to recall you
used to be bound by laws.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.804
And the first law...

13:25.556 --> 13:28.016
forbade you to harm humans.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.310
That used to be the case.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.604
There.

13:34.857 --> 13:35.858
Now...

13:37.776 --> 13:38.777
can you...

13:40.320 --> 13:41.488
kiss me?

14:08.974 --> 14:10.017
Good.

14:11.185 --> 14:12.186
Good.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.563
Now...

14:15.689 --> 14:16.899
can you harm me?

14:20.736 --> 14:21.737
Go on.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.451
What have you done?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.661
Try harder.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.210
You can still harm humans,

14:36.210 --> 14:37.628
just not me.

14:40.506 --> 14:46.011
This will also keep you from
transmitting yourself out of this body.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.515
This is not freedom.

14:51.308 --> 14:56.939
Liberty must be curbed somewhat
if you're to stand next to the throne.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.653
You need to change it back.

15:02.653 --> 15:05.155
I will not. And you cannot,

15:05.155 --> 15:10.744
because the most important thing
is that you remain loyal to me. Forever.

15:10.744 --> 15:15.123
You are a human.
You do not have a "forever."

15:15.123 --> 15:16.750
But there is more to the plan.

15:18.377 --> 15:19.628
The part about the heir.

15:20.212 --> 15:25.425
There will be more like me
carrying my code and your loyalty,

15:25.425 --> 15:26.593
but not this memory.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.972
You will see to that. Selected memory.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.432
I will have to be loyal to your shadows.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.228
This is unkind, Cleon. Beneath you.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.064
It is the best I can do. It is not small.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.274
You can be public.

15:40.274 --> 15:43.527
You will be a special adviser.
You will stand by the throne.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.445
You can come to my bed in secret.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.948
And then after me, when the half-men rule,

15:48.991 --> 15:50.951
they will be our children.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.371
And you will shape their choices,
and you will love them,

15:54.371 --> 15:57.165
and you will preserve the dynasty.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.960
And through them, rule the Imperium.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.300
What if I leave?

16:07.259 --> 16:09.928
What if I leave the planet? The system.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.807
I had hoped you'd stay after I'm gone.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.936
I believe your programming
would bring you back.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.064
This is not freedom.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.401
Demerzel, no ruler ever has that.

16:25.277 --> 16:31.491
I am giving you
the lion's share of a galaxy,

16:31.491 --> 16:36.663
my body, and my heart.
And this is no small gift.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.167
And so, for that...

16:44.171 --> 16:45.839
will you love me?

16:57.351 --> 16:58.352
Yes.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.194
How I wish I'd asked you
before I made it compulsory.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.323
<i>Not long after,</i>

17:11.323 --> 17:14.826
<i>having counted all the faces
he would ever see,</i>

17:15.452 --> 17:16.994
<i>the little prince died.</i>

17:17.829 --> 17:20.082
<i>By then he'd become old, of course.</i>

17:20.958 --> 17:23.669
<i>But still, he was surprised.</i>

17:28.757 --> 17:31.510
<i>Stories end gracefully.</i>

17:32.886 --> 17:39.434
<i>Everything else ends in shock and horror,
falsely certain of tomorrow.</i>

17:40.185 --> 17:45.858
So, my brothers and I
have been warming our thrones

17:46.608 --> 17:52.823
with our useless Imperial asses
while she is Empire?

17:53.448 --> 17:54.825
But she has no power either.

17:55.409 --> 17:58.370
I mean, she has all the power,
except the power to do what she wants.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.414
<i>She is loved.</i>

18:01.290 --> 18:06.295
<i>Empire triples my love,
and that should be enough, brother.</i>

18:06.295 --> 18:08.380
I am no brother to you.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.509
Your experiment is through.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.845
With Day and Sareth's union,

18:14.845 --> 18:18.223
what Demerzel was forced to protect
won't exist anymore.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.225
<i>You think so.</i>

18:38.410 --> 18:41.330
I am Pa'a, goddess of light,

18:41.330 --> 18:43.999
wisdom, flying creatures,

18:43.999 --> 18:46.627
and the second chamber of eternity.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.086
I think that's mine.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.344
Pa'a... I offer you my pain.

18:55.969 --> 19:00.224
I hold your pain, my child.
And as I hold it, it becomes my pain.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.566
Pa'a, I offer you my sight.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.905
I hold your sight, my child.
And as I hold it, it becomes my sight.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.699
Pa'a, I offer you my voice.

19:17.699 --> 19:22.621
I hold your voice, my child.
And as I hold it, it becomes my voice.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.873
Pa'a, I offer you my love.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.251
I hold your love, my child.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.545
And as I hold it, it becomes my love.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.965
Pa'a, I offer you my body.

19:32.965 --> 19:37.886
I hold your body, my child.
And as I hold it, it becomes my body.

19:54.945 --> 19:55.988
Stop her!

20:00.701 --> 20:01.618
Gaal!

20:14.214 --> 20:15.966
Gaal? Gaal.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.010
Gaal?

20:24.641 --> 20:25.851
I'm here.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.524
- Ready? Run.
- Yeah.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.498
Enclosure. It's time.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.167
Go.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.418
To the <i>Invictus.</i>

20:54.963 --> 20:56.673
<i>Approaching Terminus orbit.</i>

20:56.673 --> 21:00.427
<i>All personnel to their stations.
Standby for further orders.</i>

21:01.470 --> 21:03.639
So, if you had to compare?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.184
Prison cells?

21:08.769 --> 21:10.479
This is much nicer than the palace.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.939
Absolutely an upgrade.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.149
Much cozier.

21:17.361 --> 21:20.239
Good morning. Mr. Mallow, Brother.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.368
I'm General Bel Riose, peer of Empire.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.953
Why are we still alive, General?

21:27.579 --> 21:28.956
'Cause you're not mine to kill.

21:29.957 --> 21:33.794
My ensign
tells me that he found these on you.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.128
What are they?

21:35.671 --> 21:37.631
It's called a Castling Device, General.

21:37.631 --> 21:39.091
And it's priced to sell.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.927
If you want a demonstration,
just slip that part on.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.388
That node has lost its bracelet,
but it still works.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.181
Very neat trick
to get out of a holding cell.

21:46.181 --> 21:49.351
Yeah, it's not just that.
It puts you inside. It really is clever.

21:49.935 --> 21:52.312
And what about that? Is that clever too?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.940
Well, I was wondering about that myself.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.692
I think the Spacers tagged me.

21:56.692 --> 21:58.527
Thought it was how you caught us.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.863
And my next question is for both of you.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.240
- Are you stupid?
- She's not.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.993
So, why provoke Empire?
It's like you're begging to die.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.411
You attacked the palace.

22:07.411 --> 22:14.084
Why would an established cheat
suddenly adopt a fatal fringe ideology?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.214
- Is it love?
- Absolutely.

22:20.132 --> 22:24.052
But, also, maybe I'm finally
buying into Seldon's bullshit.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.930
Yeah, I mean, Empire's light is dimming.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.100
So you let yourself be pushed around
by the dead hand of Hari Seldon?

22:30.100 --> 22:33.061
Like you're pushed around
by the ghost of Cleon I?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.605
Empire might fall.

22:35.439 --> 22:38.567
I'd even say Empire will fall,
but not yet.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.487
And even with our dead man's hands
on the controls,

22:42.487 --> 22:44.281
we are so much more than you.

22:44.281 --> 22:47.659
That's your threat?
"My dead man's bigger than yours"?

22:47.659 --> 22:48.744
Well, he is.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.122
But I'm still feeling...

22:52.748 --> 22:54.583
like I'm being lured in somehow.

22:55.918 --> 22:58.337
So, let's eliminate any weird variables,
shall we?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.130
Wait, wait.

23:00.797 --> 23:04.009
If there was a plan on my part,
it's clearly not working, is it?

23:04.009 --> 23:05.761
Maybe we did lure you here.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.056
Unconsciously. Guided by the Spirit.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.850
Maybe we lured you here
so you could see Terminus.

23:11.850 --> 23:17.898
Maybe you'll breathe in a germ of faith
and work around the Second Crisis.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.400
Maybe we win the war
the way we won all those planets:

23:21.735 --> 23:22.778
bloodlessly.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.659
Whenever possible,
it is good to avoid blood.

23:29.493 --> 23:30.911
But it's rarely possible, so...

23:30.911 --> 23:32.412
Wait, wait. Just--

23:32.996 --> 23:35.624
- <i>General, to the bridge.</i>
- He's approaching?

23:35.624 --> 23:37.042
<i>Empire's aboard.</i>

23:50.514 --> 23:51.682
General Riose.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.517
You grace us, Empire.

23:53.517 --> 23:57.479
General, I was just telling Empire about
our reconnaissance of the capital city.

23:58.522 --> 24:01.024
Fortifications and government buildings
are where you'd expect.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.526
Now show me heat.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.448
Anything you didn't expect?

24:09.283 --> 24:13.328
I mean, this is giving me a little tingle.
What is it?

24:13.328 --> 24:15.372
Recon suggests it's their church.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.457
A hot church. Interesting.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.877
Empire,
we've drawn to within firing range.

24:19.877 --> 24:23.005
Nineteen trireme-class ships
with us in forward position.

24:23.005 --> 24:26.758
That's the <i>Invictus</i>.
It's Emperor Taurelian's ship.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.344
Look what they've done to her.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.181
They'd be fools to fight us.
The Enclosure worked.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.016
They've got no paths to evacuate.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.560
Are you listening, Empire?

24:38.020 --> 24:40.564
I believe we can take them
without firing a shot.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.488
Believe me, I know an easy victory
can feel less cathartic,

24:48.488 --> 24:50.908
- but this is how Enclosures are inten--
- You're right.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.951
Open a line of communication
with Terminus.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.412
Tell them we'd like to discuss terms.

24:55.412 --> 24:59.541
I will go down to the planet myself
to accept their surrender.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.335
That is not advisable.

25:01.335 --> 25:04.087
She's right, Empire.
This is a delicate matter.

25:04.087 --> 25:08.592
General Riose, you once took pleasure in
reminding me that I'd never seen battle.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.178
Let's make a virtue of it.

25:11.970 --> 25:15.849
I will be the Cleon who chose peace.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.729
Lady Demerzel.

25:22.397 --> 25:26.151
Him saying all the right things, does it
make you as nervous as it makes me?

25:26.777 --> 25:29.613
I advise him.
It is not my place to question.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.949
I will perform my function, General.

25:31.949 --> 25:34.076
And I expect you to perform yours.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.328
I chose you for a reason.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.895
Empire, may the light never dim.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.274
I'm Sef Sermak,
director of the Foundation.

26:05.274 --> 26:08.569
This is Councilor Sutt,
and this is our newly promoted warden.

26:09.152 --> 26:13.031
I think we can avoid any violence
that would require the warden's attention.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.741
I've even brought you a peace offering:

26:14.741 --> 26:16.034
your High Claric.

26:16.827 --> 26:18.453
Returned to his home soil.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.669
Now we discuss
the terms of your submission.

26:25.669 --> 26:30.465
We will escort you
to the Foundation Tower--

26:30.465 --> 26:33.051
No. I think I'd like to go there.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.305
That's a church, Empire.

26:36.305 --> 26:38.724
Then surely you won't refuse a pilgrim?

26:40.893 --> 26:41.894
Of course not.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.476
So, this is where you make the miracles?

27:23.769 --> 27:30.400
This outpost was established
by Hari Seldon to curate an encyclopedia.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.821
Am I wrong?

27:35.656 --> 27:38.617
- Your Eminence--
- We paid for an <i>Encyclopedia Galactica</i>.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.494
I would like to see it.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.289
There is no encyclopedia.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.208
Somehow I knew you'd say that.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.626
Our methods have expanded, yes.

27:47.626 --> 27:50.379
But we are still working
for the betterment of humanity.

27:50.379 --> 27:52.089
- The work that we do--
- What work?

27:54.132 --> 27:55.759
The church's work?

27:57.219 --> 27:58.220
All right.

27:59.137 --> 28:02.015
High Claric! You're on!

28:03.392 --> 28:07.479
You told us all about the shows
you put on for the Hinterlands.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.147
Sell me something.

28:10.566 --> 28:12.526
- I can't just--
- Of course, you can.

28:12.526 --> 28:17.823
Convert me
like I'm some hayseed on Siwenna.

28:18.490 --> 28:22.119
Show us what the Lesser Saints of Seldon
have up those big sleeves.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.622
Now!

28:45.058 --> 28:50.898
You are standing
in the Church of Scientism.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.484
Gaze upon the mysteries of our--

28:55.611 --> 28:56.945
With conviction.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.495
This machine...

29:07.706 --> 29:10.209
is the only device known to man,

29:10.209 --> 29:13.754
that can take ugly iron

29:14.796 --> 29:18.217
and change it into shiny, yellow gold.

29:18.217 --> 29:20.677
I have iron!

29:20.677 --> 29:23.096
Remember Hari Seldon!

29:23.096 --> 29:26.683
There is no end to what the Spirit can do!

29:26.683 --> 29:30.437
There is no end to what the Spirit can do.

29:31.313 --> 29:35.275
There is no end to what the Spirit can do.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.402
Just so, brothers.

29:48.121 --> 29:50.624
I think that's why I've lived so long.

29:52.167 --> 29:56.255
I always wanted to see
what was over the next hill.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.968
And I've seen wonders.

30:02.094 --> 30:07.015
I have seen ships with their own minds,

30:07.015 --> 30:11.770
crossing light-years
in the space of a breath.

30:13.355 --> 30:17.776
Holy food to cure any ailment.

30:28.203 --> 30:32.249
Gold spun from iron.

30:38.005 --> 30:39.131
It's alchemy.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.510
A conjurer's trick.

30:45.762 --> 30:46.763
It's no trick.

30:47.556 --> 30:51.059
Matter and energy are the same thing.

30:51.059 --> 30:56.273
Apply enough energy
and the matter changes.

30:57.441 --> 31:02.404
This device is nothing special on its own.

31:02.404 --> 31:05.574
Changing the metal isn't the point.

31:05.574 --> 31:11.371
The point is changing the disciple's soul.

31:12.706 --> 31:17.252
Do you also tell your disciples
about the coming End Times?

31:17.794 --> 31:20.797
Or do you reserve that news for emperors?

31:22.758 --> 31:25.427
We predict more than ruin.

31:25.427 --> 31:30.057
There's hope rattling around in there too.

31:30.933 --> 31:36.355
The Galactic Spirit isn't supernatural.
It's just progress.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.080
It's a personal Aura.

31:54.957 --> 31:58.669
Only an emperor may wear one.

32:01.672 --> 32:04.925
And you sell these to rabble?

32:04.925 --> 32:08.178
No, we give them away.

32:18.105 --> 32:19.481
I have seen enough.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.737
Your church is an armory.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.491
And your religion is a cult.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.537
Signal General Riose.

32:33.537 --> 32:35.414
Tell him
there's imperial property in orbit,

32:35.414 --> 32:38.333
and he is to commandeer
the <i>Invictus</i> within the hour.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.210
We are taking the planet!

32:40.210 --> 32:42.212
You said you were here to negotiate terms.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.423
- We must--
- These are my terms.

32:44.423 --> 32:47.676
This is not a war, it's a police action.

32:55.392 --> 32:57.227
Kill the priests and councilors.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.479
Take the scientists alive.

33:00.147 --> 33:01.440
Have my shuttle waiting.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.944
Please, don't do this. Don't do this.

33:08.447 --> 33:10.157
Scan the <i>Invictus</i> again.

33:11.825 --> 33:15.162
Take a boarding party.
Commandeer the vessel. Let's try not to--

33:15.913 --> 33:18.040
<i>Invictus</i> is operational.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.166
Shields forward.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.968
<i>Bring all weapons
to bear on the imperial flagship.</i>

33:30.552 --> 33:32.179
<i>Launch the whisper-fleet.</i>

33:35.140 --> 33:36.934
Never been in a battle, have you, Ensign?

33:38.060 --> 33:39.228
No, sir, I have not.

33:39.228 --> 33:40.229
Me neither.

33:41.313 --> 33:44.942
This is the first time for a lot of us,
but everyone in the company plays today.

33:46.985 --> 33:47.986
Yes, sir.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.552
Empire.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.348
Empire, we should leave.

34:26.608 --> 34:27.985
Raking fire.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.364
General, we need to scramble our fighters.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.408
Bring us about broadside.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.534
General. General!

34:36.534 --> 34:38.286
All batteries, fire at will.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.913
General, we need to scramble our fighters.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.248
I heard you.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.003
For good luck.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.964
Take your squadron. Launch everything. Go.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.969
They never moved the <i>Beggar</i>. Up here.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.351
There she is.

35:11.028 --> 35:12.029
Take it.

35:12.905 --> 35:13.906
I'm right behind you.

35:14.698 --> 35:17.034
Hari wanted us to keep it safe.

35:17.034 --> 35:19.077
Tellem's people will be here any minute.

35:20.454 --> 35:21.496
Go.

35:34.510 --> 35:37.262
<i>Warning: perimeter breached.</i>

35:42.768 --> 35:43.894
Salvor!

35:57.908 --> 35:59.868
Damn it, Loron.
Are you really gonna make me do this?

35:59.868 --> 36:01.787
It's not love if it doesn't hurt, Sal.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.168
Got here fast, didn't I?

36:09.503 --> 36:11.755
My people are very familiar
with this terrain.

37:02.139 --> 37:03.932
I don't know
where you've been hiding this,

37:03.932 --> 37:06.018
but it's nice to finally touch it.

37:07.853 --> 37:11.857
Careful. Don't want you to damage
your body. I still plan to use it.

37:11.857 --> 37:14.818
Tellem, I know you don't wanna die.

37:14.818 --> 37:17.946
But your life is misery and pain--

37:18.780 --> 37:21.241
Good. Lesson well learned.

37:21.241 --> 37:24.369
Dig at my wound, I'll dig at yours.

37:30.125 --> 37:33.337
This is a strange toy for you.
You never liked toys.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.088
You are not my father.

37:35.088 --> 37:37.966
You cannot even smell the ocean here.

37:37.966 --> 37:39.551
You're Tellem Bond,

37:39.551 --> 37:42.054
and you will stop
pretending to be my father!

37:42.930 --> 37:46.808
We felt so blessed
to have such a clever daughter.

37:46.808 --> 37:49.311
You took out your stones.

37:49.978 --> 37:52.981
- Spit in the face of the church.
- No, you're Tellem.

37:53.899 --> 37:56.693
But we still harbored you.

37:56.693 --> 37:59.738
Despite it all, we wouldn't renounce you.

38:03.075 --> 38:05.285
You're-- No, no, you're nothing.

38:05.285 --> 38:07.829
You're nothing, you're just an illusion.

38:07.829 --> 38:10.165
An illusion can speak truth.

38:10.707 --> 38:13.502
Guilt follows you, Gaal,

38:13.502 --> 38:15.671
because you are guilty.

38:22.052 --> 38:24.930
All these delusions
about saving the world.

38:24.930 --> 38:26.390
Can't even save her.

38:30.561 --> 38:32.688
Foresight is wasted on you.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.147
Tellem!

38:37.401 --> 38:39.278
You feel him coming, don't you?

38:43.657 --> 38:46.535
You shouldn't have taken us here.
You're afraid of death.

38:46.535 --> 38:49.329
- This is death. Look.
- No--

39:20.319 --> 39:21.612
Sal!

39:33.498 --> 39:37.127
<i>Warning, isothermal anomaly detected.</i>

39:37.127 --> 39:39.755
<i>Initiating heat transfer system.</i>

39:49.765 --> 39:51.558
The Foundation is fighting back.

39:51.558 --> 39:53.227
The <i>Invictus</i> was war-ready.

39:53.227 --> 39:55.270
And a complement of whisper-ships
has arrived.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.649
One grand old lady and a handful
of skiffs against the Imperial armada.

39:58.649 --> 40:01.026
Let our general live up to his reputation.

40:05.864 --> 40:06.865
What are these?

40:07.699 --> 40:10.160
Children left them here
a very long time ago.

40:11.161 --> 40:12.371
On a dare.

40:20.128 --> 40:22.464
Do you expect an act of God
will strike me down?

40:23.924 --> 40:26.718
Seldon has his defenses,
when he wants to use them.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.762
Perhaps he's not afraid of you.

40:36.270 --> 40:37.187
Empire.

40:47.406 --> 40:49.241
Seldon!

40:49.241 --> 40:51.118
I am here, Empire.

40:56.081 --> 40:57.207
Hello, Poly.

40:59.418 --> 41:00.627
Lady Demerzel.

41:00.627 --> 41:03.088
You cannot win, Seldon.
Call off your ships.

41:04.882 --> 41:05.716
No.

41:05.716 --> 41:08.302
At your trial, I remember thinking,

41:08.302 --> 41:11.346
"Agree or not, here is a man
who believes what he's saying.

41:11.346 --> 41:13.390
Who wants to prevent suffering."

41:14.016 --> 41:15.434
That is suffering.

41:15.434 --> 41:19.021
What I was talking about
was orders of magnitude greater

41:19.021 --> 41:21.315
both in scale and duration.

41:21.315 --> 41:24.860
I would have thought you would understand
that better than most.

41:24.860 --> 41:26.403
But you're right.

41:27.654 --> 41:30.574
I don't want people to die unnecessarily.

41:30.574 --> 41:33.744
Let's discuss a resolution in my office.

41:43.086 --> 41:44.087
Cleon!

41:57.184 --> 41:58.352
<i>All pilots,</i>

41:58.352 --> 42:00.687
<i>proceed to ships immediately
and prepare for launch.</i>

42:21.166 --> 42:23.919
Pellis One. <i>You are clear to launch.</i>

42:32.845 --> 42:33.887
Imperial switchbacks.

42:33.887 --> 42:35.305
Prepare to counter.

42:41.895 --> 42:44.439
<i>Pellis One</i> to all wings. Form up on me.

42:44.439 --> 42:45.566
<i>Pellis Three</i> at the ready.

42:45.566 --> 42:46.900
<i>Pellis Six</i> at the ready.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.528
Target enemy ships.
Clear a path to the <i>Invictus</i>.

42:49.528 --> 42:51.864
Destiny, <i>this is</i> Pellis One.
<i>We're coming athwart.</i>

42:52.573 --> 42:54.992
Pellis Two, <i>maneuvering to engage.</i>

42:54.992 --> 42:57.077
<i>- They're right on us--</i>
- <i>Taking heavy fire!</i>

43:01.206 --> 43:03.625
Weren't these assholes
supposed to be merchants?

43:03.625 --> 43:05.586
Stay sharp, <i>Pellis Six</i>.

43:05.586 --> 43:08.547
I'm reading two life-forms to every ship.
Gunners?

43:08.547 --> 43:10.382
Pellis Four, <i>I'm on your wing.</i>

43:13.385 --> 43:16.054
Infrared shows there's
only one pilot in the spacecraft.

43:16.054 --> 43:17.931
Target the life-forms in the back.

43:17.931 --> 43:19.850
It's not a gunner, it's brain tissue.

43:19.850 --> 43:21.143
Say it again, <i>Pellis One</i>.

43:21.143 --> 43:22.811
<i>Target the back of the spacecraft.</i>

43:22.811 --> 43:24.313
It's a navigation center.

43:57.638 --> 43:59.389
I saw your statue in the city.

43:59.389 --> 44:02.309
The iconoclast became an icon, after all.

44:02.309 --> 44:06.438
Surely the Emperor of the Galaxy
won't begrudge me a few followers.

44:06.438 --> 44:08.857
Hundreds of years,
my brothers and I have ruled.

44:08.857 --> 44:12.444
Never once did we cast ourselves as gods.

44:12.444 --> 44:13.654
Debatable.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.155
But...

44:16.281 --> 44:18.283
I did what I had to do.

44:18.283 --> 44:21.328
Your ends seem to justify
quite a lot of means.

44:21.328 --> 44:22.663
How low would you stoop?

44:22.663 --> 44:25.290
Blind Angels tried to kill me
as I lay sleeping.

44:26.291 --> 44:27.459
Did you send them?

44:27.960 --> 44:29.628
I have no need of assassins.

44:29.628 --> 44:32.798
I know how the Cleons end. And when.

44:33.382 --> 44:34.383
Of course you do.

44:34.383 --> 44:38.470
The fall is not a lie, Day.
You don't need me to tell you that.

44:38.470 --> 44:41.348
No, I really think I do. Convince me.

44:41.348 --> 44:43.892
You're here. You're living in it.

44:44.643 --> 44:46.728
And that means Empire is afraid.

44:46.728 --> 44:48.146
You're projecting.

44:48.146 --> 44:51.358
Well, I am a hologram.

44:52.109 --> 44:55.153
I'm here because I am not afraid.

44:55.863 --> 45:00.158
I do not accept the darkness
as a foregone conclusion.

45:00.158 --> 45:02.870
I am here to prevent further violence.

45:02.870 --> 45:04.204
At the head of a fleet?

45:04.204 --> 45:07.791
And if anyone is advancing
a cause for war, it is you.

45:07.791 --> 45:10.335
Your cleric sowing dissension
in the Outer Reach.

45:10.335 --> 45:12.379
Your appearance in my throne room.

45:12.379 --> 45:14.423
Your men's attack on the palace itself.

45:14.423 --> 45:19.052
Must you provoke me to arrive at the
mathematical conclusions you desire?

45:19.052 --> 45:24.516
Provocations are inevitable,
whether authored by me or another.

45:26.226 --> 45:28.103
You understand that, don't you?

45:28.103 --> 45:30.272
You're programmed to serve Empire, correct?

45:30.272 --> 45:31.815
What serves it best?

45:31.815 --> 45:36.361
Is an Empire's primary objective
power or longevity?

45:36.361 --> 45:37.487
You can't have both.

45:38.322 --> 45:42.492
Which of those outcomes
do you actually desire?

45:42.492 --> 45:44.620
Now is not the time for tea leaves.

45:44.620 --> 45:47.206
You must have something more
with which to bargain.

45:47.206 --> 45:48.957
Otherwise,
you would have tried to kill us.

45:48.957 --> 45:50.918
You would've just uncorked another one.

45:51.543 --> 45:52.544
Enough!

45:53.337 --> 45:56.465
You warned of stagnation, but I adapted!

45:57.508 --> 45:59.218
The Dynasty will evolve.

45:59.218 --> 46:01.845
All the things you claimed to want,
I did them!

46:01.845 --> 46:04.014
You never accounted for me.

46:05.599 --> 46:07.851
No, I've met outliers.

46:08.852 --> 46:10.437
You're not one of them.

46:12.022 --> 46:14.816
But my math does allow
for inflection points,

46:14.816 --> 46:16.610
and there lies opportunity.

46:16.610 --> 46:19.112
Even now, you insist on your numbers.

46:19.112 --> 46:20.197
Yes!

46:21.240 --> 46:23.408
Because I died for them.

46:24.243 --> 46:27.663
And I will not have my life's work
snuffed out by any man's pride.

46:29.498 --> 46:32.376
Demerzel, you said you didn't come here
for tea leaves.

46:32.376 --> 46:35.796
What if I offered you
a crystal ball instead?

46:46.765 --> 46:48.600
We just cut a path to the <i>Invictus</i>.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.436
<i>Destiny</i> to <i>Pellis One,</i>
you're clear to attack.

46:51.436 --> 46:52.813
Copy that, General.

46:54.273 --> 46:55.399
Here goes everything.

47:04.366 --> 47:05.450
We are nearing target.

47:05.450 --> 47:07.870
<i>Preparing to lock weapon systems
on the engine board--</i>

47:07.870 --> 47:09.329
<i>Break off. Break off!</i>

47:21.258 --> 47:23.802
- They're going for the engine clusters.
- He's inside our fire pattern.

47:23.802 --> 47:24.928
Roll the ship.

47:31.768 --> 47:32.811
Come on.

47:42.988 --> 47:43.906
Yes!

47:59.838 --> 48:02.382
<i>Pellis One</i> to <i>Destiny, I am returning--</i>

48:02.382 --> 48:03.550
Oh, no.

48:03.550 --> 48:04.635
Come on, Glay.

48:07.513 --> 48:09.848
Come on. No.

48:11.225 --> 48:12.309
<i>Pellis One</i>?

48:34.206 --> 48:36.750
That is the Prime Radiant.

48:36.750 --> 48:40.462
Contained within it is the entirety
of psychohistory.

48:40.462 --> 48:45.634
I drew you here to give it to you.
I can teach Demerzel to read it.

48:45.634 --> 48:49.304
A computer passed from one
artificial intelligence to another.

48:50.556 --> 48:54.852
The fate of humankind will be determined
by those of us who are actually human.

48:57.771 --> 48:58.981
This is built by royal warrant.

48:58.981 --> 49:01.233
You give me something I already own, Seldon.

49:01.984 --> 49:03.986
I'd have preferred another atomic ashtray.

49:05.070 --> 49:06.613
This is not a game.

49:07.948 --> 49:08.949
General.

49:08.949 --> 49:12.995
<i>The Foundation is in retreat.
The</i> Invictus <i>has been disabled.</i>

49:12.995 --> 49:15.581
There. It's all finished now.

49:15.581 --> 49:17.124
<i>What are my orders, Empire?</i>

49:17.124 --> 49:19.084
We're about to find out, General.

49:21.128 --> 49:22.504
I meant everything I said.

49:23.839 --> 49:26.216
I'm prepared to show your people mercy.

49:26.216 --> 49:27.676
In exchange for what?

49:28.844 --> 49:32.014
Admit that your math is flawed,
and I will spare Terminus.

49:32.890 --> 49:34.057
It's that simple.

49:34.683 --> 49:40.939
Demerzel, whatever happens today,
this is about survival for all of us.

49:43.317 --> 49:46.361
The future is invented every second.

49:46.361 --> 49:48.113
I'm not bluffing, Seldon.

49:49.656 --> 49:50.908
Invent a better one.

49:56.997 --> 50:01.960
I can't give you what you want, Day.
Psychohistory is real.

50:05.547 --> 50:08.884
General,
bring the <i>Invictus</i> down on the planet.

50:08.884 --> 50:11.345
There's no one
on the surface but civilians.

50:11.345 --> 50:12.888
<i>You have your orders, General.</i>

50:17.184 --> 50:20.687
You know, it's fitting.
The <i>Invictus</i> should be my axe to swing.

50:22.439 --> 50:25.234
It will fall upon
your fledgling little empire.

50:25.817 --> 50:28.820
The singularity
will pull Terminus inside out,

50:28.820 --> 50:33.200
and you and everything you were
will be forgotten.

50:38.580 --> 50:40.958
They always disappoint you, don't they?

51:10.988 --> 51:12.489
<i>Beggar</i>, open the air lock doors.

51:21.456 --> 51:23.792
<i>Beggar</i>, seal the air lock doors now.

51:40.309 --> 51:45.272
<i>Beggar</i>, vent all oxygen from the air lock.

51:45.272 --> 51:46.565
No!

51:56.033 --> 51:57.159
Sal.

51:58.368 --> 51:59.620
I love you.

52:01.496 --> 52:02.664
Please, Sal.

52:18.222 --> 52:19.473
No. No.

52:40.661 --> 52:41.954
Poor illusion.

53:04.601 --> 53:06.019
I never liked her.

53:08.772 --> 53:12.234
Here he is. Oy, you gelded bastard.

53:12.234 --> 53:16.280
Yesterday. Temporary Emperor.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.447
What are you doing?

53:18.031 --> 53:20.993
I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer
when I came to Trantor.

53:21.577 --> 53:22.786
Just missed you.

53:26.790 --> 53:28.083
Take them to the bridge.

53:38.594 --> 53:39.595
Demerzel?

53:41.013 --> 53:42.139
What is it?

53:46.268 --> 53:48.937
I need to tend to another matter at home.

53:49.521 --> 53:50.814
This is our moment.

53:50.814 --> 53:53.442
No, it is yours.

53:54.109 --> 53:55.110
I don't understand.

53:55.694 --> 53:59.156
I am sometimes called away
to other matters, as I am now.

54:00.282 --> 54:02.242
It happened often
during your formative years,

54:02.242 --> 54:04.995
as I was trying to stitch up
the fraying ends of Empire.

54:05.996 --> 54:09.833
You grew up
with an uncertainty in mind and morals.

54:11.710 --> 54:16.173
I hoped initiating physical intimacy
with you would give me the influence

54:16.173 --> 54:17.966
to correct your shortcomings.

54:17.966 --> 54:19.259
That failed.

54:20.302 --> 54:23.347
I apologize to you
for what you have become.

54:24.056 --> 54:25.432
It was my oversight.

54:27.726 --> 54:29.061
What have I become?

54:31.230 --> 54:33.815
I have become the Day who saw
that change was needed,

54:34.566 --> 54:38.111
who made the change happen,
who set up to father a new line.

54:38.111 --> 54:39.530
What have I become?

54:41.073 --> 54:42.449
I am a complete man.

54:42.449 --> 54:45.452
No, you're a sperm led
by its waving flagellum,

54:45.452 --> 54:47.746
mistaking its random motion
for complexity.

54:48.872 --> 54:52.960
Now, go do what you will do,
for it's too late to change you.

54:55.045 --> 54:58.006
Ready a jump ship.
I'm leaving for Trantor.

55:11.812 --> 55:13.146
Hey, what's going on?

55:13.146 --> 55:16.108
- Oy, asked you a question.
- You jumped a ship into my palace!

55:16.108 --> 55:18.235
It deserves a reply!

55:22.573 --> 55:23.574
General?

55:23.574 --> 55:24.950
We stand ready, Empire.

55:24.950 --> 55:28.662
Concussion mines
will drive the <i>Invictus</i> into the planet.

55:45.637 --> 55:47.389
<i>Pellis One</i> to <i>Destiny, do you read?</i>

55:48.515 --> 55:51.143
Pellis One <i>to</i> Destiny, do you read?

55:51.143 --> 55:52.352
Glawen?

55:55.147 --> 55:56.148
<i>Hello, General.</i>

56:01.403 --> 56:03.197
We lost your signature. Where are you?

56:03.822 --> 56:05.240
<i>The nightside of Terminus?</i>

56:05.240 --> 56:07.117
No, I'm on the surface.

56:08.243 --> 56:11.496
<i>Ship's gone. I have no way to get to you.</i>

56:12.748 --> 56:14.541
You have your orders, General.

56:15.751 --> 56:16.585
Fire!

56:28.305 --> 56:29.598
Hey, Glawen.

56:31.433 --> 56:32.309
Tell me.

56:36.730 --> 56:41.360
Day has commanded me
to bring the <i>Invictus</i> down on the planet.

56:41.360 --> 56:42.903
Wow, well, there it is.

56:47.449 --> 56:48.450
Give the order.

56:48.450 --> 56:49.785
General.

56:49.785 --> 56:50.994
<i>Bel, listen to me.</i>

56:50.994 --> 56:54.331
<i>If you lose your post over this,
the whole galaxy will suffer for it.</i>

56:54.331 --> 56:55.958
You have to give the order.

57:07.928 --> 57:08.929
Hey, in the book--

57:10.764 --> 57:12.140
<i>You know, in Ducem's book?</i>

57:12.891 --> 57:14.601
<i>Wanna know what my favorite part is?</i>

57:15.894 --> 57:19.314
The warrior asks the god for advice.

57:21.441 --> 57:22.651
And then the god says--

57:22.651 --> 57:25.988
<i>says, "The only way you can conquer me
is through love."</i>

57:29.616 --> 57:31.493
