00:17.184 --> 00:19.061
<i>Previously on</i> From...

00:19.061 --> 00:20.438
- Get them off me!
- Are you looking for these?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.106
Take them.
We get to keep Randall, though.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.861
We're gonna need
some fresh towels!

00:26.861 --> 00:28.612
- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Stop!

00:28.612 --> 00:30.740
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- You fucking left me!

00:34.410 --> 00:37.663
Ellis, he's so happy.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.750
I can't tell him
how scared I am.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.877
I'm trying to be patient,
but I-I need--

00:42.877 --> 00:45.087
- You can't help!
- I don't understand.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.672
This!

00:46.672 --> 00:48.048
- It's all I can keep down!
- What?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.426
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

00:52.303 --> 00:55.431
- What's wrong?
- Nothing for Christopher.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.849
Who was Christopher?

00:56.849 --> 00:58.476
He was our friend.

00:58.476 --> 01:01.020
But then Christopher
started seeing the symbol,

01:01.020 --> 01:02.646
and then everyone died.

01:04.190 --> 01:08.194
Jasper's the one who can
tell us why it happened.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.863
Easier to tell myself
they were dead.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.948
All that time,
my little boy was here.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.201
What kind of man
gives up on his family?

01:18.454 --> 01:19.997
Victor.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.832
I didn't know
how to get home.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.003
What the hell
happened last night?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.046
Boyd?

01:27.046 --> 01:28.464
Tabitha's back.

01:28.464 --> 01:29.715
What?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.217
Boyd said you went
through a tree?

01:31.217 --> 01:33.093
They're called Farway trees.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.513
Can you get back there
without the tree?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.181
I don't know.
I don't-- I don't know.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.682
What about the bottles?
Was there anything

01:38.682 --> 01:40.768
- special about them?
- I took a few of 'em down.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.269
There were slips
of paper inside

01:42.269 --> 01:44.021
with numbers
written on them.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.732
When you were out there,
did you contact anyone?

01:46.732 --> 01:49.068
You don't understand,
they wouldn't have believed me.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.654
You had an opportunity that
none of us have ever had before,

01:51.654 --> 01:53.030
and you blew it.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.907
I went out and I came back.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.826
- And I came back with nothing!
- We thought you were dead.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.663
Your children thought
you were dead.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.540
You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.305
What are you doing?

02:19.723 --> 02:21.225
I had a nightmare.

02:24.687 --> 02:26.522
You wanna talk about it?

02:26.522 --> 02:28.107
No.

02:28.107 --> 02:30.401
Well, come back to bed.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.949
I should've done more.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.911
When I was out there,
I should've done more.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.433
You did the best you could.

03:02.433 --> 03:03.726
How do you know that?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.520
What?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.273
You keep saying stuff like that.
How do you know?

03:09.273 --> 03:11.609
How do you have any idea
what I could've done?

03:11.609 --> 03:13.652
I'm just--

03:13.652 --> 03:15.362
You keep saying stuff
like that,

03:15.362 --> 03:17.448
just-- that is not true,
just so I feel better.

03:17.448 --> 03:20.200
I don't-- I don't understand.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.413
Would you-- would you rather
I just picked you apart?

03:25.623 --> 03:27.791
Make you feel like shit?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.835
I'm not gonna do that.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.379
I just want you
to be honest!

03:32.379 --> 03:33.839
No.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.010
What you want

03:38.010 --> 03:40.596
is for me
to read your mind,

03:40.596 --> 03:42.598
so I can say to you
whatever you wanna hear

03:42.598 --> 03:44.642
at any given time.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.852
You want me to be
the bad guy?

03:46.852 --> 03:50.689
Fine! But I was the one
who stayed here,

03:50.689 --> 03:53.692
holding our kids together,
while you ran off

03:53.692 --> 03:55.444
- to try to deal with whatever...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.820
- ...it was you were doing!
- You make it sound like

03:56.820 --> 03:58.072
I went on a fucking vacation.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.782
I came to you.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.241
I asked for your
fucking permission.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.285
I was just trying
to save our daughter.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.703
Did it ever occur
to you that maybe

04:04.703 --> 04:06.914
we could've
done things together?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.208
No! Because you wanted
to do it on your own!

04:09.208 --> 04:11.085
You want to do
everything on your own!

04:11.085 --> 04:12.252
That's why you--

04:12.252 --> 04:13.963
That's why what?

04:13.963 --> 04:14.922
- No.
- That's why what?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.548
Nothing.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.384
Noth-- that's why what?

04:18.384 --> 04:20.594
I'm going back to bed.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.972
Stop being a fucking
coward and tell me!

04:26.100 --> 04:27.935
That's why you
wanted a divorce,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.980
because it'd be easier
for you to cut and run,

04:30.980 --> 04:33.983
to deal with Thomas's
death on your own,

04:33.983 --> 04:37.194
instead of trying
to put our family back together!

04:37.194 --> 04:39.947
Oh, yeah and you were the knight
in shining armor, right?

04:39.947 --> 04:43.075
Everything you did, every choice
you made was perfect!

04:43.075 --> 04:45.285
- I never said that.
- You think getting the divorce

04:45.285 --> 04:46.954
was gonna let me
deal with it on my own?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.414
I was already
on my fucking own!

04:48.414 --> 04:49.623
Oh, that's so not true.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.667
You got to throw
yourself into your work!

04:51.667 --> 04:54.044
You were not there when Julie
and Ethan woke up crying.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.838
You didn't see them

04:55.838 --> 04:57.840
sitting in Thomas's room,
just staring at his toys--

04:57.840 --> 04:58.924
No.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.551
And you're upset.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.344
You're upset
because you had to

05:02.344 --> 05:05.639
take care of your children
the few days that I was gone?

05:05.639 --> 05:08.225
I took care of my fucking kids
for a year, while you were...

05:08.225 --> 05:09.810
- No! God--
- ...I don't know fucking what.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.689
Damn it, no!

05:20.863 --> 05:22.114

07:38.375 --> 07:40.127
Hey.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.171
You slept late.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.215
Where's Dad?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.303
Um, he went to the lake
with some people

07:49.303 --> 07:50.846
to get the rest of the food.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.347
He left?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.516
Yeah.
He's coming back tomorrow.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.143
Go tell Ethan
I'm making breakfast.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.105
So we're just taking
day trips to the lake now?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.275
Honey, the people
need the food.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.110
Right.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.154
And it had nothing to do with
that screaming match last night?

08:10.324 --> 08:11.992
I'm sorry you heard that.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.038
I'm pretty sure people
in Colony House heard.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.164
Listen, Julie--

08:17.164 --> 08:19.541
No. I get it.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.627
I've heard this speech
plenty of times.

08:23.921 --> 08:27.174
I'm just glad some things are
finally getting back to normal.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.300
I'll get Ethan.

08:41.563 --> 08:45.817
So you're saying
this could be some kind of code?

08:45.817 --> 08:49.154
Yeah, or an algorithm,
or-- who knows?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.949
Look, the fact is, Tabitha got
pushed out of a lighthouse

08:51.949 --> 08:55.285
and somehow ended up near
a hiking trail in Camden, Maine.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.287
I don't think I'm being
controversial when I say,

08:57.287 --> 08:58.747
by all known metrics,

08:58.747 --> 08:59.873
that's impossible.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.042
- Okay.
- Unless... Unless...

09:02.042 --> 09:05.796
she experienced some kind
of... quantum event.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.840
Right? Or wormhole, or any
number of theoretical events

09:08.840 --> 09:11.343
that would allow her to get from
the lighthouse in the woods

09:11.343 --> 09:13.470
to Camden, Maine.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.515
Or maybe...

09:16.515 --> 09:19.518
Maybe the lighthouse in the
woods occupies the same space

09:19.518 --> 09:21.270
as Camden, Maine.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.939
Maybe it wasn't a wormhole
so much as a dimensional rift!

09:23.939 --> 09:26.400
- Jade.
- I can understand an awful lot

09:26.400 --> 09:27.943
of people get confused,
but the truth is

09:27.943 --> 09:29.987
a wormhole is a shortcut
through space and time.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.863
- Whereas a dimensional rift--
- Jade, stop!

09:31.863 --> 09:34.157
Sorry. What?

09:34.157 --> 09:36.785
I thought you said you had
something exciting to show me.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.913
Yeah.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.165
All right,
okay, okay, listen, listen.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.585
I understand why
you might be skeptical.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.296
I am too.

09:47.296 --> 09:52.634
Something tells me that
this has to mean something.

09:52.634 --> 09:56.179
The bottle tree was
important to Miranda, right?

09:56.179 --> 09:58.598
And according to Tabitha,
she's the only one

09:58.598 --> 10:00.934
who had a connection to this
place long before she arrived.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.811
Did you look at the bottles
from the other tree?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.773
What other tree?
The one in Maine?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.400
- No. How could I--?
- No, the one--

10:08.400 --> 10:10.360
Sara and I found

10:10.360 --> 10:12.654
one of these trees when we went
out into the woods together.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.239
It wasn't a portal tree,

10:14.239 --> 10:16.825
but it still had
bottles hanging from it,

10:16.825 --> 10:18.285
messages inside.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.831
I pulled one down,
it said... "1864."

10:22.831 --> 10:24.374
1864.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.710
Eighteen. Eighteen six...

10:29.296 --> 10:31.923
I saw it.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.091
Uh...

10:36.553 --> 10:38.347
"1864."

10:42.934 --> 10:45.062
Where's the second tree?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.573
Hey. Sorry.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.660
I was looking for you
and I just figured I'd wait.

11:01.870 --> 11:02.954
Okay.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.670
I haven't seen
one of these in a long time.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.590
Yeah. That belonged
to Mrs. Davis.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.008
Is that right?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.678
What was Mrs. Davis doing
with one of these?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.931
She bought it
for her son,

11:20.931 --> 11:22.557
he was very sick,

11:22.557 --> 11:24.726
and he saw the car
in the back of a magazine.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.271
And so, she drove far away

11:28.271 --> 11:30.899
to buy one
from the only store

11:30.899 --> 11:33.151
that still sold them.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.571
Uh...

11:37.781 --> 11:39.699
She...

11:39.699 --> 11:41.827
She said her son
didn't have very long,

11:41.827 --> 11:45.789
and she knew that
the car would make him...

11:45.789 --> 11:46.957
smile.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.213
She saw the tree
before she got home.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.551
And she died
a long time ago.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.721
I guess her son is dead too.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.188
Yeah, I was thinking maybe

12:10.188 --> 12:12.274
you could show me
around today.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.444
Uh, there's something
I have to do.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.281
It's very important.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.409
Oh. Mind if I tag along?

12:22.409 --> 12:26.204
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.747
Right.

12:29.708 --> 12:33.378
Well, I'll--
I'll just get out of your way.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.922
Uh...

12:35.922 --> 12:39.134
Uh, it's...

12:39.134 --> 12:41.428
very... dangerous,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.555
what I have to do,
and I--

12:43.555 --> 12:45.974
and I don't want
you to get hurt.

12:52.022 --> 12:56.735
But you could walk with me
for a bit, if you want.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.614
All right. I'd like that.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.032
Okay.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.213
I, uh, finished
cleaning out the ambulance.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.464
Here's the last of it.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.799
Awesome. Thanks.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.594
Oh, this stuff is
gonna be a godsend.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.304
I'm gonna bring this
downstairs.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.847
Oh, I can give you a hand.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.432
You've done plenty, really.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.060
You should go home,

13:30.060 --> 13:31.478
get some rest.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.646
Thank you.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.283
Coming or going?

13:45.283 --> 13:47.702
Oh, I, uh-- going.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.287
You okay?

13:50.247 --> 13:53.166
Yeah. You know, I...

13:53.166 --> 13:54.376
I'm good.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.461
Yeah.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.630
- Kenny--
- I'm good.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.840
I'm good, really.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.260
I don't wanna
talk about it right now.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.970
Okay. Yeah.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.137
Yeah.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.101
Boyd!

14:55.061 --> 14:56.938
Shouldn't you be in bed?

14:56.938 --> 14:59.274
I don't think you're one
to talk about taking it easy.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.234
Well...

15:02.485 --> 15:03.778
He's doing better.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.741
Yeah. Yeah. I was...

15:07.741 --> 15:10.285
I was just, uh...

15:10.285 --> 15:13.622
Hey, that ambulance
came in fully stocked.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.124
There was a portable
ultrasound onboard.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.500
Really?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.502
Yeah.
When you see Fatima,

15:19.502 --> 15:21.421
tell her to come on by.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.341
She can take a look
at her little nugget.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.509
I'll do that.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.804
Hey, look, don't mention
that I came by, okay?

15:29.804 --> 15:31.389
Yeah, of course.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.974
Right.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.018
That's really good news,
the ultrasound.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.353
Yeah.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.072
Say something.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.202
We have to go to Kristi.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.665
No.
I can't do that.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.880
I mean, there's gotta be some
sort of medical explanation.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.507
How can there be?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.761
Look, I don't...

16:09.761 --> 16:11.638
I don't want
everyone looking at me

16:11.638 --> 16:14.099
the way that you're
looking at me right now.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.976
Like you're
afraid of me.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.896
No, no, I am--
I am not afraid of you.

16:19.896 --> 16:24.651
Okay? And whatever is happening
is not your fault, okay?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.403
I just...

16:26.403 --> 16:28.738
I just--
I just wanna help you.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.490
Maybe it'll just go away.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.951
You know, maybe it'll
just go away on its own.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.744
- And maybe--
- Baby...

16:34.744 --> 16:36.538
Maybe it'll just stop.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.624
Who is it?

16:39.624 --> 16:42.502
It's Dad.
I, uh, got some good news.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.715
Just-- just a second.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.717
Just a second.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.801
Hey.

16:50.969 --> 16:54.305
Hey, look at me.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.641
Look,
I-I am just as scared as you.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.478
Okay?
But we cannot do this alone.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.108
If it's a bad time--

17:08.945 --> 17:10.321
No, it's fine.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.493
Okay.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.250
Hey. What's...

17:26.171 --> 17:27.505
What's going on?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.303
Come in.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.537
Donna?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.376
I heard about what happened.
I'm so sorry.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.089
Were you two close?

18:11.800 --> 18:15.428
He was a pain in my ass
for almost two years.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.642
He had some
good moments, though.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.268
Would have loved this;

18:22.268 --> 18:26.147
me hauling these
fucking stones across town.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.690
Only thing
he would've liked better,

18:27.690 --> 18:29.275
is if I left him to rot,

18:29.275 --> 18:31.402
so he could ruin everyone's
breakfast every morning.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.532
I was there
when he went through.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.912
He was just trying
to help, you know?

18:40.912 --> 18:44.457
I'm sure he had some shitty
remark on his way out.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.174
You doing okay?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.176
Yeah, yeah.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.763
That meeting yesterday
couldn't have been too easy.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.098
Well, I just...

19:01.599 --> 19:03.434
I just feel that...

19:04.686 --> 19:07.397
everyone expects me to have
all the answers, you know?

19:08.898 --> 19:11.025
I feel like I let them down.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.069
I feel like
I let my family down.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.071
Let them down?

19:15.071 --> 19:18.283
Tabitha, your children
thought you were dead!

19:20.076 --> 19:22.871
They don't need
answers from you.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.164
They just needed you back.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.291
Yeah.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.340
What if the people from
the meeting were right?

19:36.926 --> 19:38.177
What if I wasted

19:38.177 --> 19:40.930
the only opportunity
we're gonna get?

19:40.930 --> 19:42.849
You see Dale down there?

19:44.142 --> 19:46.895
You went through
that same tree.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.314
That could have been
you down there.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.648
I know.

19:52.066 --> 19:55.278
Don't try to be a hero.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.196
Go spend time with your kids

19:57.196 --> 19:59.532
because you're lucky
to be here still.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.869
Don't take that for granted.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.664
I'm done.

20:10.585 --> 20:11.628
Hey.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.632
I'm sorry about your friend.

20:20.595 --> 20:21.679
Well, back to work.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.889
Yeah.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.223
You, uh...

20:24.223 --> 20:25.934
tell those kids of yours
I said hello.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.435
I will.

20:38.655 --> 20:42.700
So you-- you wanna
go down into the tunnels,

20:42.700 --> 20:44.535
where these things live?

20:44.535 --> 20:48.122
I don't want to.
I have to.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.167
Because there's
something down there

20:51.167 --> 20:53.211
that is going to help people?

20:53.211 --> 20:56.589
It's going to save them.
It'll save you too.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.677
We're here.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.809
You should go now.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.310
Do you remember
the way back?

21:09.310 --> 21:11.688
I'm-- I'm not going back.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.064
I'm, uh, coming with you.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.482
No, that's not a good idea.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.527
No. I just got you back.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.612
I'm not losing you again.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.741
If you're gonna do this,
we're doing it together.

21:26.869 --> 21:27.996
Okay.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.218
What-- what are
those for?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.053
So we don't get lost.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.311
Follow close.

21:52.311 --> 21:56.065
Hey, and be really,
really quiet.

22:04.073 --> 22:08.202
I mean, we've seen things here
that-- that don't make sense.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.204
And...

22:10.204 --> 22:14.792
these-- these cravings,
maybe it's just...

22:17.086 --> 22:19.380
I mean, may--
maybe it's just the effect

22:19.380 --> 22:21.799
that this place has
on pregnancy,

22:21.799 --> 22:23.926
so it doesn't have to mean
that there's something wrong

22:23.926 --> 22:25.219
with the baby, right?

22:25.219 --> 22:26.512
Right.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.390
Right.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.936
Kristi has
an ultrasound machine.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.567
Wait. What?

22:39.567 --> 22:42.737
It was on the ambulance
that came into town.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.073
That's what
I came to tell you.

22:49.994 --> 22:54.665
No. I-I don't--
I don't-- I don't wanna.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.167
Could you give us
a second?

22:56.167 --> 22:59.253
Oh, yeah, of course.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.713
Yeah.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.486
Fatima...

23:23.486 --> 23:24.779
Ellis, I don't want to see it.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.489
No, we can't...

23:30.952 --> 23:32.995
We cannot just hope

23:32.995 --> 23:34.622
that this gets better, okay?

23:34.622 --> 23:35.873
- I know.
- Okay.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.667
We are in the dark.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.586
I know. We'll do it tomorrow.
We'll go tomorrow.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.255
Fatima, Fatima...

23:47.051 --> 23:48.970
- I just want it to be okay.
- I know.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.430
Hey, hey, it's okay.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.974
I just want it to be okay.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.226
I know, baby.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.854
I'm sorry.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.898
Okay. I know.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.909
Good, you're awake.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.954
The fuck do you want?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.664
We need to change
your bandages.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.959
It's fine.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.838
I need to make sure
there's no infection.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.798
That's not something you want,
not here.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.343
Fine.
I'll fuckin' change 'em.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.637
I need you to sit up.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.431
Please. Come on.

24:34.724 --> 24:35.725
Yeah.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.269
Okay, yeah.

25:04.712 --> 25:05.963
May I?

25:05.963 --> 25:07.089
Yeah.

25:28.945 --> 25:30.655
Well?

25:30.655 --> 25:35.201
Um, there's
no sign of infection.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.995
And the stitches are
holding well.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.498
There's gonna be a lot of
bruising, a lot of discomfort.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.877
I wanna see it.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.772
Give me a minute?

26:07.942 --> 26:09.944
Yeah, take your time.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.251
Hey.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.295
What are you doing?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.714
You're not gonna
tell my parents, are you?

27:13.883 --> 27:16.385
If you get caught,
I was never here.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.012
- Deal.
- Okay.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.221
You want some?

27:19.221 --> 27:21.140
Don't push it.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.143
Hey, I was-- I was looking
for the screwdriver.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.146
My mom always kept
a junk drawer in the kitchen.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.398
Um, yeah.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.150
My dad gets fidgety
when he's nervous,

27:31.150 --> 27:32.818
so he probably
just moved stuff around.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.489
Oh. Um, okay.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.866
Um, God, no, I-- I'm sorry.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.327
With my mom being gone,
he probably didn't even realize.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.496
No, it's fine. It's just a--
it's just a junk drawer.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.081
I'm sorry.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.833
It's not a big deal, seriously.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.295
Um, I'm gonna go-- I'm gonna
go check the dining room.

27:51.295 --> 27:56.050
You just keep
that under wraps. 'Kay?

27:56.050 --> 27:57.301
Okay.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.597
Oh God.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.092
How much further?

28:38.092 --> 28:39.760
Shh!

28:39.760 --> 28:41.095
This way.

28:55.276 --> 28:56.485
No, he...

28:58.154 --> 29:00.156
He should be here.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.740
This is where I saw him.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.330
This whole chamber was full.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.665
Now it's not.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.709
Maybe we took a wrong turn.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.586
No.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.921
Jasper,
he was sitting right here.

29:15.921 --> 29:20.843
There was a clock
and a wheelchair.

29:20.843 --> 29:24.180
And the bad things,
they were sleeping.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.807
Hey, maybe
we should go back.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.267
You can get your bearings.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.685
I know where I am.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.688
We need to go deeper.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.315
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.192
- We can't leave without Jasper.
- Victor.

29:37.860 --> 29:39.403
It's important.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.865
We'll be okay.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.165
This way.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.510
She's coming.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.765
She just, uh...

30:09.850 --> 30:11.393
She just needs a minute.

30:18.734 --> 30:19.985
Thanks.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.782
Hey, smile.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.868
What?

30:27.868 --> 30:29.662
Me and Julie found this
in the basement.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.955
I figured we should put together

30:30.955 --> 30:32.623
a little
Colony House photo album.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.209
Doesn't have to all
be scary and bad.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.502
Okay.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.673
I'm gonna put
a collage on the wall,

30:40.673 --> 30:43.425
if you wanna
check it out later.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.398
You ready?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.654
I don't wanna say anything...

31:05.114 --> 31:06.949
to Kristi,

31:06.949 --> 31:08.993
not until we have to.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.579
Okay.

31:11.579 --> 31:12.746
You're coming, right?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.000
Whatever you guys need.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.297
All right.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.860
Great.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.445
And then
there were two.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.905
Oh, for fuck's sake!

31:51.160 --> 31:53.537
It's ironic, no?

31:53.537 --> 31:56.415
A drunk looking for answers
in a tree filled with bottles.

31:59.627 --> 32:03.130
Why-- why are
you wiping that glass?

32:03.130 --> 32:05.341
A man does what a man does.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.765
So, you really think this is
gonna tell you anything?

32:12.765 --> 32:14.892
I think this place
has a design.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.602
Ah.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.270
I don't think
anything's here by accident.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.942
Maybe that's your problem.

32:23.942 --> 32:28.614
And what, dead Tom,
does that mean?

32:30.407 --> 32:34.662
Well, nature has
a design, Jade,

32:34.662 --> 32:37.331
and that is not nature.

32:38.332 --> 32:40.918
It's just something
somebody put there.

32:40.918 --> 32:43.712
Sure, it might mean
something, yeah.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.506
Maybe it's something
someone made

32:45.506 --> 32:48.050
because they thought
it meant something.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.430
Maybe it's someone
like you...

32:55.683 --> 32:58.852
...just looking for answers,
trying to figure things out.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.855
Grasping at straws.

33:01.855 --> 33:04.566
And here you are, standing,
looking at this bottle tree,

33:04.566 --> 33:07.361
puzzling over it like it's
a part of the original design.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.238
No.

33:11.532 --> 33:15.953
See, Miranda had visions
of this place.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.579
She had visions of these trees.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.456
You don't have visions

33:19.456 --> 33:21.333
about things
that don't mean anything.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.210
What about
the things you see?

33:23.210 --> 33:25.421
The Civil War soldiers?

33:25.421 --> 33:27.339
The guy crushed by the rock
in the root cellar?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.800
No, no, no. Listen,
those were different.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.261
Okay? Those were
completely different.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.221
How so, Jade?

33:34.221 --> 33:37.725
Fine! All right, fine!
Maybe it's garbage.

33:37.725 --> 33:40.018
Maybe this is
a giant waste of time.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.062
Are you gonna help me
bring these down or what?

33:42.062 --> 33:43.647
I gotta finish this first.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.734
Oh, for fuck's sake...

33:46.734 --> 33:49.278
Jade. You mad?

33:49.278 --> 33:51.739
I am a little bit
annoyed, yeah!

33:51.739 --> 33:53.615
You should work on that.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.492
Because the Jade that built
a multi-million-dollar company

33:55.492 --> 33:57.161
when everyone said
he shouldn't,

33:57.161 --> 34:00.289
that guy had
thicker skin. Yeah.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.000
You really wanna
beat this place?

34:04.251 --> 34:06.295
Maybe you should sober up

34:06.295 --> 34:08.422
and give that guy a call.

34:18.432 --> 34:21.059
There's a nicer way
to make your point, you know!

34:31.236 --> 34:32.905
Hey, buddy.

34:34.323 --> 34:36.742
What ya got there?

34:36.742 --> 34:39.077
It's Tian Chen's.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.037
Oh.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.379
Did you learn to read Chinese
while I was gone?

34:49.379 --> 34:50.839
No.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.343
Where's your sister?

34:56.720 --> 34:58.639
She went for a walk.

35:03.519 --> 35:06.021
Do you think Tian-Chen's
with her husband now?

35:07.856 --> 35:10.275
I hope so.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.569
Do you think they were happy
when they got married?

35:18.575 --> 35:19.952
Honey...

35:21.411 --> 35:23.622
I'm so sorry you heard us
fight last night.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.582
I'm so sorry.

35:27.501 --> 35:30.379
We're just trying
to do our best...

35:30.379 --> 35:31.713
for all of us.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.637
I liked it better
when we first got here.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.225
Everyone was so scared,
there was no time to be angry.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.813
I wish it could be
like that again.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.487
What's Jade doing at the bar?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.155
That's what you guys were
fighting about, right?

35:58.824 --> 36:01.577
Jade, um...

36:01.577 --> 36:04.037
he's-- he's trying
to figure out a puzzle.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.539
What kind of puzzle?

36:09.710 --> 36:10.836
Is someone upstairs?

36:10.836 --> 36:12.129
No.

36:14.882 --> 36:16.008
Are you sure?

36:16.008 --> 36:17.301
What's wrong?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.512
Wait.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.996
Anghkooey.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.123
Oh my God.
Why are you here?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.666
Anghkooey!

36:49.666 --> 36:51.543
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Anghkooey!

36:51.543 --> 36:52.878
Oh my God!
Anghkooey!

36:52.878 --> 36:54.755
I tried to help you!
Anghkooey!

36:54.755 --> 36:57.341
I tried to help you!
Leave us alone!

36:57.341 --> 36:59.217
Anghkooey! Anghkooey!

36:59.217 --> 37:01.261
No, no, no, no, no!
Anghkooey!

37:01.261 --> 37:03.013
Anghkooey! Anghkooey!
Mom?!

37:03.013 --> 37:04.348
Anghkooey!

37:04.348 --> 37:05.682
Mom?!
Anghkooey!

37:05.682 --> 37:06.725
Mom!
- Anghkooey!

37:06.725 --> 37:07.768
What?

37:07.768 --> 37:09.478
Are you okay?

37:09.478 --> 37:12.522
What?
We're okay.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.567
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.486
Oh my God.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.863
- We're okay. It's okay.
- Was it the children?

37:19.863 --> 37:21.365
Yes.

37:21.365 --> 37:22.783
Can we go outside?

37:22.783 --> 37:24.368
Yes. Let's go. Let's go.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.005
It's really nice of you
to do this for him.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.967
Would've hated it.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.302
"Great. A pile a rocks?
That all I get?"

37:44.429 --> 37:45.806
Well...

37:47.557 --> 37:51.061
it's not just rocks.
It's dignity.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.854
Everyone deserves that.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.275
Yes, they do.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.494
You don't have
to be here, honey.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.746
You've already been
through enough of this.

38:09.746 --> 38:12.541
Uh, actually,
I was kinda wondering

38:12.541 --> 38:15.544
if you maybe had some extra
space up at Colony House.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.212
For me.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.969
She was the only thing
that ever made that house

38:23.969 --> 38:25.762
feel like a home.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.889
It was meant for a family.
She'd want them to have it.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.396
We always have room for you.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.443
You're not still throwing
those sex parties up there,

38:39.443 --> 38:41.528
are you? 'Cause I...

38:41.528 --> 38:43.196
Oh, just go pack your stuff

38:43.196 --> 38:45.866
before I change my mind.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.242
Yes, ma'am.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.922
There we go.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.470
Can we come in?

39:06.470 --> 39:08.346
I'm a little busy.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.474
Well, I told Ethan we can--

39:10.474 --> 39:12.059
we can help you
with your puzzle.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.688
Uh, sure. Yeah.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.192
You like puzzles, buddy?

39:20.192 --> 39:22.027
Yeah.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.862
Well, great,
'cause this one

39:23.862 --> 39:26.156
just got a whole lot
more interesting.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.365
How?

39:30.202 --> 39:31.828
Turns out there is
a second bottle tree.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.165
- There's two of them?
- Mm-hmm.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.250
Not only that, but the messages
in the bottles, the numbers,

39:37.250 --> 39:39.377
they're all the same.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.129
I mean, the placement's
obviously different,

39:41.129 --> 39:43.256
and in the second tree,
they're written out in cursive.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.427
But the actual numbers,

39:47.427 --> 39:50.013
you line them up side by side;
they are exactly the same.

39:50.013 --> 39:53.016
Not to mention some of them
repeat, over and over again.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.810
What does that mean?

39:54.810 --> 39:56.728
I have no idea.

39:59.314 --> 40:03.276
But I am increasingly optimistic
that, somewhere in here,

40:03.276 --> 40:05.737
somewhere in these dates,
in these numbers,

40:05.737 --> 40:10.242
is a key to something
that we need to understand.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.410
You wanna help me
find it?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.370
Okay.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.507
You need to apply this every
time you change the bandages.

40:25.507 --> 40:27.467
I heard you the first time.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.303
That gets infected,
you're gonna be in a world of--

40:30.303 --> 40:32.305
I said I heard you.

40:35.142 --> 40:36.434
Okay.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.646
You're all set, then.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.359
Why are you pretending
you're okay?

40:45.861 --> 40:47.737
If you're talking
about Nicky, that was--

40:47.737 --> 40:49.614
No, you know
what I'm talking about.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.874
Just make sure
you change the bandages.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.253
You can pretend
all you want,

41:03.253 --> 41:05.172
but you were there,

41:05.172 --> 41:07.007
same as me.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.513
What if it's not over?

41:17.225 --> 41:20.562
Whatever happened to us,
it wasn't...

41:20.562 --> 41:22.355
What?

41:22.355 --> 41:23.315
It wasn't real?

41:26.026 --> 41:28.195
What the fuck
is "real" anymore?

41:31.907 --> 41:33.325
Ah, it's gotta be
easy for you

41:33.325 --> 41:35.493
in a place like this,
though, huh?

41:35.493 --> 41:38.371
Going to sleep next
to somebody every night.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.248
You get to pretend
that you're okay.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.086
Yeah, well, it's not
like that out on the bus.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.796
I don't get to pretend.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.383
It's fucking...

41:50.383 --> 41:52.344
terrifying.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.442
So, then,
don't go back to the bus.

42:08.944 --> 42:11.738
We got room.
Go get your stuff.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.033
You serious?

42:15.033 --> 42:18.954
Yeah. No one here has
to be alone.

42:18.954 --> 42:20.830
I'll talk to Kristi.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.629
Okay.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.673
How many of those
little green men do you have?

43:17.053 --> 43:19.139
We'll be fine.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.103
Shh. Careful.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.646
All right.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.528
Victor, I think
we should turn around.

43:33.528 --> 43:34.904
Shh. It won't be much further.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.616
You don't know that.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.077
If we get lost
down here...

43:43.079 --> 43:44.581
We won't get lost.

43:44.581 --> 43:47.000
Careful.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.209
Hey, hey, look.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.086
- We can come back.
- No.

43:50.086 --> 43:52.380
- Figure out a plan.
- No!

43:52.380 --> 43:54.507
Victor, please--

43:54.507 --> 43:55.884
- Wait, wait.
- What?

43:55.884 --> 43:57.010
Look, look, look.

44:03.266 --> 44:04.517
We have to go through.

44:04.517 --> 44:05.894
No, Victor!

44:42.764 --> 44:43.807
Shh...

44:51.523 --> 44:53.566
No. Wait, wait.

44:58.947 --> 44:59.823
Okay.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.327
Let's go. Let's go.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.620
Oh, God.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.914
This is--
it's your mother's.

45:12.836 --> 45:14.379
- Oh, God.
- Shh!

45:14.379 --> 45:16.089
We have to go.

45:16.089 --> 45:19.134
You know, Victor,
if you keep coming down here,

45:19.134 --> 45:21.719
one of these days,
we'll make you stay.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.600
Go!

45:27.600 --> 45:29.436
Go, go, go!

45:29.436 --> 45:31.438
Go! Come on!

45:47.120 --> 45:49.414
You movin' out?

45:49.414 --> 45:50.790
Yeah.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.794
Found a sweet little
condo up the road.

45:54.794 --> 45:55.920
Yeah?

45:55.920 --> 45:58.715
Yeah.
Ocean views. Indoor gym.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.384
Sounds nice.

46:01.384 --> 46:02.427
Yeah.

46:05.430 --> 46:06.598
Where are you really going?

46:08.349 --> 46:10.810
Marielle said
I could stay at the clinic.

46:12.729 --> 46:14.105
How's she doing?

46:15.064 --> 46:16.983
She's acting like
nothing ever happened.

46:18.735 --> 46:20.028
How are you doing?

46:22.238 --> 46:24.824
Get stoned a lot.
It helps.

46:26.910 --> 46:28.828
You got anything on you now?

46:36.628 --> 46:39.547
Okay. Come inside.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.800
Careful.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.843
Careful.

46:43.843 --> 46:45.637
Come.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.597
Sit here.

46:47.597 --> 46:48.848
Okay.

46:52.101 --> 46:55.146
That thing, its voice...

46:55.146 --> 46:57.774
It's okay.
We're safe now.

46:57.774 --> 47:01.277
Why did they have this?
It's your mother's.

47:01.277 --> 47:04.030
I don't know.
They like to take things.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.406
Why?

47:07.450 --> 47:08.868
I don't know. They just do.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.545
What is this place?

47:18.545 --> 47:23.091
It's... just somewhere...

47:23.091 --> 47:25.927
somewhere I come when
it gets too loud sometimes.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.722
I used to hide here...

47:31.474 --> 47:33.893
...before the people came.

47:33.893 --> 47:37.981
At night?
You would hide in here?

47:37.981 --> 47:40.650
Uh-huh.

47:42.402 --> 47:45.613
Because you were alone.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.031
My God.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.324
It's okay.

47:48.324 --> 47:51.244
No, everything--
everything is okay now.

47:51.244 --> 47:53.454
Look, we found Jasper.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.915
That means
that we can save people.

47:57.166 --> 47:59.419
How?

47:59.419 --> 48:01.129
He knows things.

48:02.463 --> 48:03.423
Yeah.

48:17.020 --> 48:20.189
I heard him tell Christopher
a story about this place once,

48:20.189 --> 48:22.150
and we have to make him
tell it again.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.615
But Victor...
Victor...

48:30.074 --> 48:33.077
that's a toy.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.330
We'll make him tell it again.

48:37.332 --> 48:38.916
You'll see.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.420
Okay.
Let's lift this up.

48:44.047 --> 48:45.131
I got the gel.

48:45.131 --> 48:48.092
Oh, great. Thank you.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.219
All right, so,
it's just gonna be a bit cold.

48:51.971 --> 48:53.723
Now, keep in mind,
it's still early days,

48:53.723 --> 48:55.266
so it's not gonna
look like much yet.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.894
It'll be about
the size of an acorn,

48:57.894 --> 49:00.480
and if we're lucky,
we might see the arms and legs.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.066
So, just, keep your
expectations in check, okay?

49:03.066 --> 49:04.567
Okay.

49:05.735 --> 49:06.819
Ready?

49:08.571 --> 49:11.157
Okay.

49:22.043 --> 49:24.879
Okay, so,
there's your uterus.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.264
What's going on?

49:35.264 --> 49:37.975
I, um...
Hm.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.188
I don't see anything.

49:43.856 --> 49:46.609
What--
what do you mean?

49:46.609 --> 49:48.861
Um...

49:51.948 --> 49:53.658
You're not pregnant.

49:57.537 --> 50:01.916
No, no, that's--
that's impossible.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.001
I need you to keep looking.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.212
Fatima--
You barely looked!

50:06.212 --> 50:09.173
- Just keep looking!
- Sweetie, I'm so sorry--

50:09.173 --> 50:10.925
I don't need you to be sorry!

50:10.925 --> 50:12.468
I need you to look again.
Hey, it's okay.

50:12.468 --> 50:14.053
- It's not okay!
- It's okay, just--

50:14.053 --> 50:16.431
Okay, we'll take
a look together, okay?

50:18.182 --> 50:19.183
It's okay.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.435
All right.

50:22.270 --> 50:25.523
So right here is where
the baby's supposed to be.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.859
But there's nothing there.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.612
No, I...

50:31.612 --> 50:35.908
There's something inside of me.
I need you to find it.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.869
Fatima...

50:37.869 --> 50:40.496
there's nowhere
else to look.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.460
We need to tell them.

50:46.711 --> 50:47.795
Tell us what?

51:16.449 --> 51:20.411
Help me, Elgin.
I can save you.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.705
I can save all of you.

51:22.705 --> 51:25.291
I can help you
go back home.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.793
Hey.

51:26.793 --> 51:29.086
Are you all right?

51:29.086 --> 51:30.546
You look weird.

51:30.546 --> 51:32.715
I'm fine.

51:34.383 --> 51:35.384
I like the collage.

51:55.822 --> 51:58.741
The fact that some
of the numbers repeat,

51:58.741 --> 52:00.326
that means there's
a pattern somewhere.

52:01.744 --> 52:03.746
The 2 on this one's
backwards.

52:03.746 --> 52:06.541
Mm-hmm.

52:06.541 --> 52:08.084
Same thing with
the number seven,

52:08.084 --> 52:10.294
but they're only
backwards sometimes.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.380
- Why?
- I don't know.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.881
That's why we have
to figure out the pattern.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.132
If we can
figure out the pattern,

52:15.132 --> 52:16.509
then we can
figure out the shape.

52:17.927 --> 52:20.012
Get cracking.

52:24.225 --> 52:27.103
Look...

52:27.103 --> 52:29.564
whatever those kids are,
they're not gonna hurt you.

52:29.564 --> 52:31.274
How do you know that?

52:32.483 --> 52:34.527
They want your help, right?

52:34.527 --> 52:37.822
I don't know. Maybe.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.783
I'm basing that on
something a dead woman saw

52:40.783 --> 52:43.661
in a vision
40 years ago, so...

52:56.257 --> 52:58.217
What is this?

52:58.217 --> 53:01.512
Some wards scattered
around the settlement.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.556
I'm guessing they're protective.
They don't really seem--

53:09.687 --> 53:12.273
What's wrong?

53:12.273 --> 53:14.191
Three red stones.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.700
What?

53:22.700 --> 53:24.076
Three red stones.

53:25.536 --> 53:29.624
Did you-- did you see
three red stones?

53:29.624 --> 53:31.417
Big ones in a circle?

53:32.793 --> 53:35.129
How did you--?

53:35.129 --> 53:37.840
No. No, no.

53:51.103 --> 53:52.980
When I was a little girl,

53:52.980 --> 53:57.318
I would have the same nightmare
over and over again.

54:01.405 --> 54:03.115
It wasn't just Miranda.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.203
I saw this place too...

54:08.996 --> 54:10.957
...but I just didn't know it.
