Hey, you have yet to tell me
why you thought

42:14.619 --> 42:16.403
that walker
was gonna lead us to PADRE.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.274
Even after
I followed along.

42:18.318 --> 42:19.667
So I don't think
it's too much to expect

42:19.711 --> 42:23.628
a straight answer
to a straight question.

42:23.671 --> 42:25.804
What is this
all about?

[Sighs]

42:31.940 --> 42:34.508
I had a dream.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.164
When I was in the bunker,
after I cut it off.

42:38.207 --> 42:41.254
You had a dream.

42:41.297 --> 42:43.604
When my fever was at its worst,
there was this voice,

42:43.648 --> 42:45.084
and I thought
it was telling me

42:45.127 --> 42:46.607
the walker would
lead us there.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.957
Thought it was coming
from PADRE.

42:49.001 --> 42:50.306
But it was coming
from where?

42:50.350 --> 42:51.830
Me.

42:51.873 --> 42:55.790
Look,
my mom had her dream.

42:55.834 --> 42:59.620
Nick had his.
You have yours.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.927
I've always had such
strong voices around me.

43:01.970 --> 43:04.538
I've never stopped
to really listen to mine.

43:06.758 --> 43:09.369
But I am now.

43:09.412 --> 43:11.806
So, where will you go?

43:11.850 --> 43:13.242
The bunker.

43:13.286 --> 43:14.679
There's a working transmitter
down there

43:14.722 --> 43:16.115
and I need it
to reach people.

43:16.158 --> 43:18.160
'Cause that walker,

43:18.204 --> 43:20.641
I thought it would
lead us to PADRE,

43:20.685 --> 43:25.690
but I was wrong, because
I don't think PADRE even exists.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.605
But there are a lot of people
out there like me

43:27.648 --> 43:28.693
who are looking for it,

43:28.736 --> 43:30.433
or looking
for a place like it.

43:30.477 --> 43:32.610
Hey, you can't lead people
to a place that doesn't exist.

43:32.653 --> 43:35.003
I know.
But I can lead them to us.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.701
To us? Like...

43:39.399 --> 43:41.227
...you're gonna
become PADRE?

43:41.270 --> 43:43.446
I'm going to give them
what they want.

43:43.490 --> 43:45.100
A safe place to live,

43:45.144 --> 43:46.580
and that's how
we get our army.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.931
That's how we take the Tower
from Strand.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.413
I should come
with you.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.154
No, I need you
to stay here.

43:55.197 --> 43:59.941
Because when I come back,
that's when we make our move.

43:59.985 --> 44:02.683
Then we will be ready
for when you get back.

44:02.727 --> 44:05.468
But you should
rest first.

44:08.863 --> 44:10.299
I can't.

44:11.779 --> 44:12.737
Just be ready.
