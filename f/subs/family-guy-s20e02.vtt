<i>Muddy grew up in a shotgun shack

<i>His family was so poor,</i>

08:26.965 --> 08:30.385
<i>they lived underneath
the mighty Mississippi.</i>

08:30.468 --> 08:33.388
<i>They all had to share one room</i>

08:33.471 --> 08:35.932
<i>and one mustache.</i>

08:36.016 --> 08:39.728
Well, I'm off to make something

08:47.694 --> 08:50.196
<i>In those days, Black people had nothing,</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:53.116
<i>but they still had
to wear suits everywhere.</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:57.537
<i>The only instrument Muddy could
afford was a one-string guitar.</i>

08:57.620 --> 09:01.291
<i>That one guitar string
was also the family belt.</i>

09:04.878 --> 09:07.130
<i>Despite all his setbacks,</i>

09:07.213 --> 09:10.133
<i>Muddy would do whatever it took
to master the guitar,</i>

09:10.216 --> 09:13.887
<i>even if it meant making a deal
with the devil himself.</i>

09:13.970 --> 09:17.849
<i>So he headed on down to the crossroads.</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:21.227
<i>The Crossroads being
a fancy school in Los Angeles.</i>

09:21.311 --> 09:23.521
<i>Tobey Maguire's kid goes there.</i>

09:37.535 --> 09:39.037
<i>Muddy was right.</i>

09:39.120 --> 09:42.290
<i>He never got invited to dinner
with Jake Gyllenhaal</i>

09:42.374 --> 09:44.376
<i>or his sleepy-eyed sister,</i>

09:44.459 --> 09:46.294
<i>which is probably for the best.</i>

09:46.378 --> 09:48.922
<i>She looks like she chews
with her mouth open.</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:51.508
<i>But Muddy did get his guitar lessons.</i>

10:00.058 --> 10:02.894

You got yourself a deal.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.983

Big crawdads guy, huh?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.027
Oh, yeah.
They're the best.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.029
Please look at the road
while you're driving.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.947
I wouldn't know about crawdads.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.616
- Never had 'em.
- What?

11:39.699 --> 11:40.742
You got to try 'em!

11:40.825 --> 11:42.702
Here, take the rest of mine. I insist.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.288
<i>But Muddy</i> had <i>had crawdads.</i>

11:45.372 --> 11:46.956
<i>Many times.</i>

11:47.040 --> 11:50.126
<i>That was just his little trick
for getting free crawdads</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:52.087
<i>from coarse Italians.</i>

11:55.173 --> 11:56.800
What are you working on?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.427
I'm trying to write a nice
letter to my wife Margerie,

11:59.511 --> 12:01.429
but I never been any good with...

12:01.513 --> 12:02.931
Damn it, what are those things?

12:03.014 --> 12:05.767
- Words?
- Yeah, I-I never been any good at words.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.936
In fact, I'm downright great at 'em.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.688
I could help you if you want.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.691
Yeah? Could you make it sound
so she thinks me,

12:12.774 --> 12:15.151
a white guy, is the one
who actually wrote it?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.986
Easy.
Write this.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.530
"Dearest Margerie,

12:18.613 --> 12:20.532
"I can't wait to get home

12:20.615 --> 12:23.910
"and back that big fat ass up.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.538
"Back, back, back it up.

"Back, back, back it up.

Wu Tang Clan ain't nothing to mess with."

12:32.502 --> 12:33.920
<i>Dearest Margerie,</i>

<i>Yours, Vinny.</i>

12:41.219 --> 12:43.346
<i>Ultimately, Vinny went his own way</i>

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
<i>with the letter.</i>

12:47.517 --> 12:48.768
Hey, Muddy, I was thinking,

12:48.852 --> 12:50.478
since we made it to the part of the story

12:50.562 --> 12:52.814
where we realize that we're not
so different from each other,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.024
we should celebrate.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.276
Yeah?
What did you have in mind?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.028
I don't know.
Maybe...

12:58.111 --> 12:58.945
that!

13:06.619 --> 13:08.455
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:08.538 --> 13:10.331
This is a "whites only" carnival.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.542
It's okay, Vinny.
Let's get out of here.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.504
No! This is unacceptable,
and it will not stand!

13:18.590 --> 13:21.009
My friend is a human being!

13:24.721 --> 13:26.806
We demand recourse!

13:31.102 --> 13:33.104
Unconscionable!

13:33.188 --> 13:35.065
<i>And though the trip was soon over,</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:38.360
<i>a friendship was formed
that transcended race.</i>

13:38.443 --> 13:40.111
<i>But it would not last long.</i>

13:40.195 --> 13:41.321
What the hell?!

13:41.404 --> 13:44.199
All the pages in my songbook are torn out!

13:46.743 --> 13:49.537
<i>Dear Muddy, I have something to confess.</i>

13:49.621 --> 13:51.206
<i>I stole all your songs,</i>

13:51.289 --> 13:53.083
<i>and my real name is Elvis Presley.</i>

13:53.166 --> 13:54.959
That son of a bitch!

13:55.043 --> 13:57.379
Damn you, Elvis Presley!

13:57.462 --> 13:58.713
Oh, well.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.341
There's still an exciting future
ahead of me.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.802
This ain't the end of my story.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.305
Oh, no.
The screen's turnin' sepia.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.015
This <i>is</i> the end of my story!

14:09.099 --> 14:10.517
I got to get to a stool for the one

14:10.600 --> 14:12.435
"old-timey Black guy musician" photo

14:12.519 --> 14:14.562
anyone will ever know me by.

14:14.646 --> 14:18.066
<i>Muddy didn't make it to the stool
in time for his photo.</i>

14:18.149 --> 14:20.610
<i>Elvis never gave him
the credit he deserved.</i>

14:20.694 --> 14:24.948
<i>And people were</i> pissed
<i>when</i> Green Book <i>won that Oscar.</i>

14:25.031 --> 14:26.950
<i>The end.</i>

14:33.039 --> 14:34.374
Great story, Jerome.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.210
Elvis really was the best.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.337
Peter, is that Stewie?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.673
Oh, yeah.
Looks like he's gonna do one next.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.091
You're gonna let the baby do one?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.760
Oh, I'm sorry, are <i>your</i> children funny?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.012
No.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.472
Ah, here it is.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.474
Elton John's <i>Greatest Hits,</i>

14:51.558 --> 14:54.185
a collection of songs
by the one gay guy on earth

14:54.269 --> 14:56.146
with a worse haircut than Pete Rose.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.735
We'll defer that end-of-year bonus

15:01.818 --> 15:03.403
to the following fiscal quarter,

15:03.486 --> 15:04.988
harvest the losses on our cap gains--

15:05.071 --> 15:06.573
that's a no-brainer-- and, let's see,

15:06.656 --> 15:08.491
update my beneficiary designations?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.326
Uh, yeah, I think so.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.661
Damn, I'm good.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.915
Elton John, what the hell
do you think you're doing?!

15:15.999 --> 15:17.751
It's just a little number crunchin', Pop.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.419
What's going on in here?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.713
Why don't you ask your son, the tax man?

15:21.796 --> 15:23.798
I found these under his mattress!

15:23.882 --> 15:25.342
W-2s!

15:25.425 --> 15:27.802
I-I was holding them for a friend.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.973
Wh-Wh-What are you doin', Pop?

15:32.057 --> 15:35.268
No son of mine is gonna be
a heterosexual paper pusher.

15:35.352 --> 15:39.147
You need to be a loud-and-proud
performer like your gay old dad!

15:50.658 --> 15:52.786
Aah! You hit me!

15:52.869 --> 15:56.206
Oh, Elton. I'm telling you this
because I love you.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.708
You'll never find someone to love you.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.461
Not even Dolly Levi could help you.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.421
- Who's Dolly Levi?

16:03.505 --> 16:06.675
Oh, where did we go so wrong?!

16:06.758 --> 16:09.761
<i>So Elton John
collaborated with Bernie Taupin,</i>

16:09.844 --> 16:12.180
<i>who would write the lyrics
for Elton's songs.</i>

16:12.263 --> 16:14.933
<i>Bernie was married three times
in a desperate bid</i>

16:15.016 --> 16:17.435
<i>to convince the world
he was not a homosexual.</i>

16:19.104 --> 16:20.397
All right, Bernie, what do you got?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.398
Uh, how 'bout this?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.149
"Yours are the sweetest eyes

16:23.233 --> 16:24.275
I've ever seen."

16:24.359 --> 16:25.402
They are?

16:26.403 --> 16:27.904
Whoa!
I-I'm not gay.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.906
You're not?
Y-You just seem very...

16:29.989 --> 16:32.158
Yeah. I'm British.
We all seem that way,

16:32.242 --> 16:34.202
even if we're not but secretly are.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.708
Elton, meet the best producer
in the business.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.419
Kid, how would you like to sign
with my label,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.504
Naive-Young-Talent Records.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.924
Together, we are gonna make me millions!

16:48.008 --> 16:50.301
Sounds fair to me.
Let's get to it!

16:50.385 --> 16:52.804
<i>From then on, Elton's new male producer</i>

16:52.887 --> 16:55.515
<i>rode him day and night.</i>

16:55.598 --> 16:57.892
<i>When Elton was tired of playing,
he'd get right behind him</i>

16:57.976 --> 17:00.478
<i>and push him on the stool
until he was finished.</i>

17:00.562 --> 17:01.688
<i>Sometimes Elton would cry</i>

17:01.771 --> 17:03.523
<i>because of how hard he was pushing.</i>

17:03.606 --> 17:05.734
<i>But it paid off, because, in the end,</i>

17:05.817 --> 17:07.902
<i>they had a massive load.
Of hits.</i>

17:07.986 --> 17:11.990
<i>Just a-just a big, messy load of hits.</i>

17:12.073 --> 17:15.076
<i>The night Elton John performed
at Dodger Stadium,</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:18.329
<i>he was so nervous,
he almost never left the dressing room.</i>

17:18.413 --> 17:20.290
CROWD

17:20.373 --> 17:22.083
Elton! Elton!

17:30.425 --> 17:31.468
Whoa, dude, no!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.470
I'm just a straight moment of clarity.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.472
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't, uh...

17:35.555 --> 17:37.640
<i>But his reflection had walked away,</i>

17:37.724 --> 17:39.184
<i>never to return.</i>

17:39.267 --> 17:41.353
<i>And he had to do his own makeup.</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:44.272
<i>Also, due to a scheduling error,</i>

17:44.356 --> 17:46.358
<i>the Dodgers had a game that night,</i>

17:46.441 --> 17:49.110
<i>and Elton had to bat fourth in the lineup.</i>

17:52.614 --> 17:55.283
<i>It's a mince-off single
and the Dodgers win!</i>

17:58.661 --> 18:01.915
<i>Elton John was heavily involved
in the L.A. party scene,</i>

18:01.998 --> 18:03.917
<i>and things took a dark turn one night</i>

18:04.000 --> 18:06.711
<i>when he and Bernie
went to a party in the Hollywood Hills,</i>

18:06.795 --> 18:08.630
<i>one where you park way down at the bottom</i>

18:08.713 --> 18:10.340
<i>and have to walk all the way up.</i>

18:12.717 --> 18:14.427
God, how much farther is it?

18:14.511 --> 18:16.054
I don't know.
You didn't get a TripTik.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.390
That's 'cause the rock star
doesn't get the TripTik.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.266
The writer gets the TripTik.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.643
Damn it, here comes another person

18:21.726 --> 18:23.395
walking to the same party.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.772
Let's stop, so we don't have
to walk with him the whole way.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.358
When they said this party was "far out,"

18:28.441 --> 18:29.693
they weren't kidding.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.528
I know, right? Yeah.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.612
-♪ ♪
- Look, we've got to be close.

18:32.696 --> 18:33.613
I can hear the music.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.699
Damn it! We're in the wrong canyon!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.158
Well, I'm exhausted.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.451
Come on, let's just go home.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.537
I don't know. I kind of want to stay out.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.288
Hang on. Hey!

18:42.372 --> 18:45.083
What's the cocaine sitch like
at that party?!

18:45.166 --> 18:47.002
Enough to kill a Belushi!

18:47.085 --> 18:48.753
But you probably don't want to come!

18:48.837 --> 18:51.172
It's a real sausage fest over here!

18:51.256 --> 18:52.841
I'm going to that party.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.760
Elton, if you leave me
right now, it's a big deal,

18:55.844 --> 18:58.430
because this is the time of the story
where that's a big deal.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.683
What'd you say?! I couldn't hear you
over the sound of snorting!

19:01.766 --> 19:04.769
Have fun getting home
without a TripTik, trip dick!

19:04.853 --> 19:08.106
Whoa-ho!
Looks like Elton learned how to write!

19:14.154 --> 19:15.780
How is he, Doctor?

19:15.864 --> 19:18.408
Well, looks like your husband's
gonna be all right, Mr., uh...

19:18.491 --> 19:20.618
I've been married three times!
I'm Bernie Taupin!

19:20.702 --> 19:21.619
You know what, don't worry about it.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.829
I already forgot who you are.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.289
Anyway, congratulations.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.125
Elton will be back on his knees
in no time.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.044
Look at me.
At some hospital

19:29.127 --> 19:31.046
next to a Denny's by the airport.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.798
All day long,
it's just Denny's and the jets.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.009
Wait, what'd you just say?
Say that again.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.012
The important thing is you're alive.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.223
Thanks. Hey, what do you say we
get the ol' team back together

19:42.307 --> 19:45.518
for a "what do they look like now"
credits montage?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.271
Well, we can,
but I'm not sure you'll like it.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.273
<i>That's what I look like?!</i>

19:50.357 --> 19:52.484
<i>Who is letting me out of the house like...</i>

19:52.567 --> 19:55.737
<i>Someone in the future
is seriously failing me!</i>

19:55.820 --> 19:58.239
<i>Yeah, you look like

<i>I know!
- You look like a Muppet</i>

20:01.743 --> 20:03.661
<i>All right, that's enough.
Why are we making fun of me?</i>

20:03.745 --> 20:06.956
<i>I'm not a bad guy.
Let's just make fun of Sean Hannity again.</i>

20:07.040 --> 20:09.959
<i>He looks like a guy

20:10.043 --> 20:11.586
<i>He looks like Alan Thicker.</i>

20:11.670 --> 20:13.213
<i>He's a guy whose wife yells at him</i>

<i>for getting his ball powder

20:15.340 --> 20:17.175

<i>For more Hannity slams,

20:26.893 --> 20:29.562
<i>Okay. But now we're done.</i>
