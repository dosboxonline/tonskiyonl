RESTORED IN 2016
FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE

00:40.834 --> 00:45.672
WINNER, SPECIAL JURY PRIZE
CANNES FILM FESTIVAL 1973

01:03.648 --> 01:09.320
FANTASTIC PLANET

01:09.487 --> 01:15.160
Based on the Novel by
STEFAN WUL

03:46.394 --> 03:48.062
She stopped moving.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.231
Now we can't play
with her anymore.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.904
Careful! It's Master Sinh.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.751
Look, Father.
A female Om and her baby.

04:09.918 --> 04:11.920
You think she's dead?

04:12.253 --> 04:13.922
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.716
Why's the baby making noise?

04:16.841 --> 04:20.928
It depends.
He could be frightened or hungry.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.265
We can't leave him here.
Let me keep him.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.435
Please, Father.
I'll take care of him.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.355
All right, Tiwa.
We can't let this animal die.

04:31.648 --> 04:36.611
<i>Thus I first heard the name
of the Grand Master of the Draags.</i>

04:37.278 --> 04:40.865
<i>In saving my life,
he linked my fate to his.</i>

05:15.942 --> 05:18.319
<i>Mother!</i>

05:21.489 --> 05:24.659
Look at the little Om.
Isn't he cute?

05:26.619 --> 05:29.122
His mother's dead.
I'm going to keep him.

05:30.039 --> 05:33.418
He's very pretty, Tiwa.

05:36.838 --> 05:40.842
Tiwa, you disturbed
your mother's meditation.

05:41.426 --> 05:45.346
If you can't discipline that animal,
I'll have to take it away.

05:45.722 --> 05:49.142
But Father, he ran off.
He needs a collar.

06:33.686 --> 06:35.730
You must learn to use it. Watch.

06:37.857 --> 06:39.859
Set the animal down.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.215
How fun! Let me try.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.977
Not so fast!

07:15.103 --> 07:16.938
The animal's delicate.

07:17.105 --> 07:18.940
You might hurt him.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.777
What are you going to call him?

07:25.113 --> 07:27.615
Tiwa, like me.

07:27.949 --> 07:30.284
That's not an Om's name.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.121
Call it Trusty or Frisky.

07:33.246 --> 07:35.623
Look at him wriggle,
the little terror!

07:38.084 --> 07:40.670
I'll call him Terr.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.478
<i>I was forgotten about.</i>

07:57.812 --> 07:59.856
<i>A baby Om is nothing</i>

07:59.981 --> 08:03.067
<i>compared to the extraordinary
importance of their meditation,</i>

08:03.192 --> 08:07.029
<i>that strange ritual to which my masters
devoted most of their time</i>

08:07.155 --> 08:09.907
<i>and which seemed to be
their chief concern.</i>

08:43.607 --> 08:45.651
Contrary to projections,

08:45.776 --> 08:48.529
the housing unit factory
on our Uva at Goham

08:48.654 --> 08:50.990
has not met
its new production target.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.452
The worker machines
show unusual wear,

08:54.577 --> 08:57.163
and that seems
to have caused the lag.

08:58.206 --> 09:03.544
- Master Taj, can you explain?
- We don't yet know the reason.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.463
In the meantime,

09:05.588 --> 09:09.717
we'll use reserve worker machines
to meet the schedule.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.220
I don't understand.

09:12.345 --> 09:15.723
The machines have worked
perfectly up till now.

09:16.057 --> 09:20.228
Have you had
the same problem on other Uvas?

09:22.230 --> 09:26.275
Only machines from our space flight
to Planet Antax 4...

09:26.400 --> 09:31.155
had some trouble
completing their program.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.243
Master Sinh, our scientists
attribute this decline in activity

09:35.368 --> 09:39.288
to a rupture in their system
of emotional equilibrium.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.541
Our scientists also noted

09:42.667 --> 09:44.961
<i>that animals
brought from Planet Terra</i>

09:45.086 --> 09:49.090
<i>had a high level
of savibon and intelligence.</i>

09:49.590 --> 09:52.134
<i>I'm not so sure they're correct.</i>

09:52.260 --> 09:56.347
<i>It's clear that this animal
has adaptive capabilities.</i>

09:56.639 --> 09:59.308
<i>But is that intelligence?</i>

09:59.433 --> 10:04.689
<i>The little pet you're stroking
between meditations</i>

10:04.814 --> 10:07.566
<i>may well surprise you one day.</i>

10:07.692 --> 10:11.946
<i>Films made on Terra reveal
numerous traces of organized life.</i>

10:40.558 --> 10:43.894
<i>These adaptive capabilities
you mention, Master Kah,</i>

10:44.020 --> 10:47.315
<i>may indicate
an advanced evolutionary state.</i>

10:47.440 --> 10:51.110
<i>Oms have a much shorter
life span than us,</i>

10:51.235 --> 10:54.989
<i>but keep in mind that
they reproduce much more rapidly.</i>

10:55.156 --> 10:57.575
<i>Whether this animal evolves or not,
Master Sinh,</i>

10:57.700 --> 11:00.870
<i>we have yet to establish.</i>

11:00.995 --> 11:03.080
What we <i>have</i> established

11:03.497 --> 11:05.916
is the considerable damage

11:06.042 --> 11:09.170
caused by Oms
on the Uvas of Jexte and Télèze.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.840
The number of domesticated Oms
is easy to verify,

11:12.965 --> 11:15.968
but the number of wild Oms
is probably much greater

11:16.093 --> 11:18.679
than is generally acknowledged.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.683
We de-Om the enclaves
of wild Oms every three cycles,

11:22.808 --> 11:25.811
but I wonder if that's often enough.

11:25.936 --> 11:29.273
Few weapons remain effective
in the long term.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.777
Forceful measures must be taken.

11:32.902 --> 11:35.738
New ways to fight them
are currently being researched,

11:36.197 --> 11:38.199
<i>but I doubt they will suffice.</i>

14:49.890 --> 14:51.892
Tiwa, go play somewhere else.

14:55.396 --> 14:57.064
I'm sorry.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.650
Imagination was so rich today.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.527
This animal is a pest!

15:01.652 --> 15:05.573
Think nothing of it.
Our children all love those animals.

16:59.395 --> 17:02.022
<i>I grew up fast in that slow world,</i>

17:02.690 --> 17:06.109
<i>for a Draag week
was equal to one of my years.</i>

17:06.276 --> 17:09.029
<i>I was just a living plaything</i>

17:09.154 --> 17:11.240
<i>that sometimes dared to rebel.</i>

17:11.740 --> 17:13.534
<i>Tiwa loved me.</i>

17:16.494 --> 17:19.707
“Terr loves Tiwa.”

17:20.374 --> 17:22.041
Repeat.

17:22.626 --> 17:27.131
Terr loves Tiwa. Repeat.

18:09.339 --> 18:13.719
<i>Tiwa received her education
through a headset.</i>

18:13.844 --> 18:17.514
<i>The lessons were transmitted
directly into the brain...</i>

18:18.265 --> 18:21.101
<i>and engraved in the memory forever.</i>

18:24.146 --> 18:27.816
<i>“Our planet Ygam
has just one satellite,</i>

18:27.941 --> 18:29.818
<i>the Wild Planet,</i>

18:29.943 --> 18:32.780
<i>which is uninhabited
and is used for meditation.</i>

18:32.946 --> 18:35.032
<i>Ygam is divided
into several Uvas.</i>

18:35.157 --> 18:39.453
<i>Two of them, Strom and Yot,
are natural and symmetrical.</i>

18:39.578 --> 18:42.289
<i>Urtana is the largest Uva</i>

18:42.414 --> 18:45.375
<i>and is completely covered
with blue assanic blocks.</i>

18:45.501 --> 18:51.006
<i>Furthermore, temperatures there
range from 8 to 243 laiks,</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:54.218
<i>making exploitation impossible.</i>

18:54.343 --> 18:58.889
<i>Our Uva, Goham,
has a fepular inland sea</i>

18:59.014 --> 19:01.934
<i>that stabilizes the apenosh
at about 25 laiks.</i>

19:02.059 --> 19:06.271
<i>Fixation blocks
combat pontic ribation,</i>

19:06.396 --> 19:09.858
<i>and emmaliate domes
regulate pressure.</i>

19:09.983 --> 19:14.321
<i>All Uvas undergo a cycle
of three seasons of differing lengths.</i>

19:14.488 --> 19:18.158
<i>The season
of garus crystallization...”</i>

19:18.283 --> 19:21.578
<i>By accident
I too was able to acquire</i>

19:21.703 --> 19:23.497
<i>the Draags' knowledge.</i>

19:23.664 --> 19:26.500
<i>“When the soil peels,</i>

19:26.625 --> 19:29.211
<i>dense vegetation replaces all mosks</i>

19:29.336 --> 19:31.547
<i>with similar mosks.”</i>

19:31.672 --> 19:33.715
<i>I liked the lessons</i>

19:33.841 --> 19:36.677
<i>and did my best
to make the most of them.</i>

19:36.802 --> 19:39.596
<i>“The cliffs on the fepular sea</i>

19:39.721 --> 19:43.016
<i>are eroded
by rains that often last...”</i>

21:42.594 --> 21:46.223
Tiwa, bring your animal over here.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.142
Jurgal has his here.
We'll have some fun.

21:50.102 --> 21:54.189
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's Om is like a ferocious animal.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.401
He nearly tore
Terr's ears off the other day!

21:57.985 --> 22:01.822
He won't hurt your Om.
Come play!

22:03.156 --> 22:04.825
Come see!

22:49.703 --> 22:52.205
Let's have Terr fight.
It will be more fun.

22:52.706 --> 22:55.500
Terr will win. He's really wild.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.213
Go fight.

23:24.988 --> 23:28.241
- He sings well.
- Terr can sing too.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.166
Sing, Terr. Go on.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.673
- He'll strangle him!
- I don't know what he's doing.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.218
What a horrid animal!

24:42.482 --> 24:47.779
<i>“It's easy to see
a tark's fladed musculature</i>

24:47.904 --> 24:50.949
<i>because the animal
is easily skinned.”</i>

25:00.625 --> 25:02.335
You hear the Om?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.838
He's reciting Tiwa's lesson.

25:04.963 --> 25:08.341
She loves Terr so much
that she's never without him.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.802
You think he understands
what he's saying?

25:10.927 --> 25:12.804
I don't think so.

25:12.929 --> 25:16.099
Anyway, I'll forbid Tiwa
to have the Om with her

25:16.224 --> 25:17.976
during her Infos.

25:18.101 --> 25:21.229
She has to study seriously.

25:21.354 --> 25:24.649
<i>“Let us observe
the chiscinian muscle of a tark's leg.</i>

25:24.774 --> 25:29.070
<i>The chiscinian muscle
is a sinewy, threadlike vilore...”</i>

25:39.206 --> 25:42.417
<i>“The molog is an anviparous animal.</i>

25:42.542 --> 25:45.545
<i>It has over half a billion lucons,</i>

25:45.670 --> 25:47.881
<i>and the entire surface of their walls</i>

25:48.006 --> 25:50.383
<i>is made up of tiny cells</i>

25:50.508 --> 25:53.261
<i>separated by very thin sheets
of organure.</i>

25:53.386 --> 25:58.141
<i>Some scientists today believe
it is not organure</i>

25:58.266 --> 26:02.479
<i>but gambous amalga,
an artificial structure...”</i>

26:02.604 --> 26:05.857
Is Terr with you again
during your Infos?

26:05.982 --> 26:08.360
I told you not to do that.

26:08.652 --> 26:10.654
Back to the Omerie!

26:12.197 --> 26:16.576
He doesn't disturb me, Father,
and he's so happy.

26:16.743 --> 26:20.789
The Infos are for you.
Back to your studies now.

26:30.173 --> 26:35.095
<i>The day came for the Draag children
to meditate for the first time.</i>

26:36.096 --> 26:39.557
<i>The initiation ceremony
was an essential step</i>

26:39.683 --> 26:42.560
<i>on their road to knowledge.</i>

28:07.103 --> 28:10.940
<i>Tiwa's interest in me
had been fading for some time.</i>

28:11.358 --> 28:15.070
<i>As she grew into her teens,
she gave up her playthings.</i>

28:15.862 --> 28:19.157
<i>I could no longer
make use of the lessons.</i>

28:19.282 --> 28:21.242
<i>I decided to run away.</i>

28:54.901 --> 28:57.904
Mother, I can't find Terr!

28:58.071 --> 29:00.073
And my headset is gone.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.575
Then use your bracelet.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.412
But if he's far away,
I'll hurt him.

29:05.537 --> 29:08.248
Put your bracelet
on maximum right now!

29:10.583 --> 29:12.085
No, Mother...

29:57.714 --> 30:01.009
You're not very bright,
like all tame Oms.

30:01.926 --> 30:06.473
- But you have a collar too.
- It's a fake, to fool the Draags.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.558
What's that?

30:08.975 --> 30:11.144
A device invented by the Draags.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.812
A what?

30:13.271 --> 30:15.148
A Draag device.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.859
Listen.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.656
<i>“Valio cycle, Info 4.</i>

30:23.823 --> 30:26.367
<i>You will observe
that searching for aklons</i>

30:26.493 --> 30:28.786
<i>in pernetrope in space</i>

30:28.912 --> 30:32.790
<i>is carried out
in the same way as on land.</i>

30:32.916 --> 30:36.669
<i>Note that the search
is not only for festation groups...”</i>

30:36.794 --> 30:39.339
Don't be afraid.
It's not dangerous.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.555
Where are you taking it?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.682
- I don't know.
- Follow me.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.917
<i>My new friend
took me to her people,</i>

31:58.084 --> 32:02.005
<i>who lived hidden in the Big Tree
deep in an abandoned park.</i>

32:07.802 --> 32:10.179
<i>This tame Om looked ridiculous</i>

32:10.305 --> 32:13.099
<i>in his first encounter
with wild Oms.</i>

32:30.074 --> 32:32.535
Don't touch that case.
It's a trap!

32:53.181 --> 32:57.393
<i>Since I had brought the headset
of knowledge to the Big Tree,</i>

32:57.518 --> 32:59.937
<i>the wizard opposed me
from the start.</i>

33:00.980 --> 33:03.358
We've brought five cases, Chief.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.276
Is that all?

33:05.526 --> 33:08.655
One of the cases was a trap,
and Frisky is dead.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.990
He knew the case was a trap.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.326
He's a tame Om, Chief.

33:13.451 --> 33:15.370
He escaped
with a Draag device

33:15.495 --> 33:18.373
that taught him
how to read Draag writing.

33:18.498 --> 33:21.501
I'm sure he can't read.
Ask what's in the cases.

33:22.543 --> 33:26.839
Does the tame Om know
what's in that case there?

33:28.383 --> 33:31.010
Yes. Colored powder.

36:43.452 --> 36:48.291
<i>“...temperatures there

<i>are full of craters -”</i>

37:14.609 --> 37:19.196
- Why did you stop the Infos?
- Draag knowledge is evil.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.741
We Oms don't need it.

37:21.866 --> 37:23.910
We're not tame Oms.

37:24.118 --> 37:26.370
It's a grave offense.

37:26.495 --> 37:30.041
You must fight
as set forth in the law.

37:30.917 --> 37:33.252
Bring the combat animals.

38:23.594 --> 38:25.763
You're the winner.

38:25.930 --> 38:30.601
Stay with the Oms of the Big Tree.
You can be of use to us.

38:30.977 --> 38:34.438
Tomorrow we set off
on an expedition.

40:12.620 --> 40:16.791
<i>It was my first expedition
to steal food from the Draags.</i>

40:17.416 --> 40:19.752
<i>We came back
loaded with spoils.</i>

40:33.766 --> 40:36.602
Take heart.
The Big Tree isn't far now.

40:42.942 --> 40:45.444
The Hollow Bush bandits!
Watch out!

41:02.920 --> 41:05.506
Why did they attack us?

41:05.631 --> 41:09.218
They're the Hollow Bush gang.
Beware of them.

41:09.385 --> 41:13.305
They're thieves
from the other side of the park.

41:16.308 --> 41:20.396
<i>“In the third millennium before Kraup,
the Great Zarek created</i>

41:20.521 --> 41:23.232
<i>the first pyramic civilization.</i>

41:23.357 --> 41:25.693
<i>Legend says that from his tomb</i>

41:25.818 --> 41:28.112
<i>he still animates the ball of life,</i>

41:28.237 --> 41:31.157
<i>that his body, though constantly
pierced by projectiles,</i>

41:31.323 --> 41:33.617
<i>does not change,</i>

41:33.742 --> 41:37.371
<i>and that his mind has regularly
traversed the skies of Ygam</i>

41:37.496 --> 41:40.291
<i>ever since the Draags,
under his direction,</i>

41:40.416 --> 41:43.002
<i>fought off
the first Yanko invaders.</i>

41:43.127 --> 41:46.922
<i>Certain experts believe
this is how meditation came about.</i>

41:47.047 --> 41:49.967
<i>Others believe
that Zarek is immortal</i>

41:50.509 --> 41:54.180
<i>and that from the flames of time
he reappears in reality,</i>

41:54.305 --> 41:57.266
<i>whirling in infinite forms,</i>

41:57.391 --> 42:01.437
<i>to fight the part of the Draag spirit
that wishes to die.</i>

42:01.687 --> 42:03.189
<i>In fact...</i>

42:09.695 --> 42:12.031
<i>after the pyramic civilization,</i>

42:12.198 --> 42:15.367
<i>the Draags fought off
Yanko invasions...”</i>

42:15.868 --> 42:18.037
The Oms are learning.

42:18.204 --> 42:21.582
If only we had more headsets.

42:23.459 --> 42:27.379
Terr, you're as learned
as the Draags.

42:27.671 --> 42:31.383
I'm barely learning to write.

42:31.550 --> 42:33.052
Look.

45:48.914 --> 45:50.749
<i>Are you sure?</i>

45:51.291 --> 45:53.502
You're sure
you read it correctly?

45:53.627 --> 45:57.798
Yes, “de-Om” is written
on all the park walls.

45:57.923 --> 46:02.761
- What does it mean?
- The Draags mean to kill all the Oms.

46:02.886 --> 46:06.723
I witnessed
a de-Omization long ago.

46:06.849 --> 46:08.517
It was horrible.

46:08.642 --> 46:12.896
But we're not in any great danger
now here in our tree.

46:13.021 --> 46:15.315
What are we going to do?

46:15.441 --> 46:19.445
- It was bound to happen.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.

46:19.611 --> 46:21.530
We'll post sentries.

46:21.655 --> 46:24.825
They're out to slaughter us

46:24.950 --> 46:27.578
as punishment
for stealing their knowledge.

46:27.703 --> 46:30.289
Let us pray to the Wild Planet.

46:30.414 --> 46:32.958
The sentries will warn us
of the Draags' approach.

46:33.125 --> 46:35.043
We'll see tomorrow.

48:05.217 --> 48:08.053
What were you doing
in our territory?

48:12.307 --> 48:16.353
I came to warn you. The Draags
intend to de-Om the park tomorrow.

48:16.687 --> 48:20.691
De-Om the park? You don't say!
How do you know?

48:20.816 --> 48:23.902
A member of our group
read the writing on the walls.

48:24.111 --> 48:28.782
So the Oms in the Big Tree
can read Draag writing now?

48:28.907 --> 48:30.909
Don't listen to him.

48:31.076 --> 48:34.204
It's a trap to lure us out
of the Hollow Bush.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.707
You must believe me!
They're going to de-Om.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.667
Take him away!

48:40.294 --> 48:42.588
Someone go look at the walls.

53:04.474 --> 53:06.017
<i>Listen!</i>

53:06.852 --> 53:09.521
Draags!
- Quiet!

53:21.074 --> 53:24.035
- It smells of Oms here.
- The vermin!

53:24.160 --> 53:27.289
The Masters should decontaminate
the area more often.

53:27.414 --> 53:30.834
A tame Om is fun as a pet,

53:30.959 --> 53:34.588
but wild Oms steal,
and they're dirty,

53:34.713 --> 53:37.382
and they reproduce
at an alarming rate.

53:37.549 --> 53:39.801
There's a nest in the gutter!

53:39.926 --> 53:43.221
It's a whole colony!
Let's kill them.

54:24.262 --> 54:27.140
The chief is dead.

54:27.265 --> 54:29.309
Stop blubbering like children.

54:29.434 --> 54:33.438
We must go
where the Draags can't find us.

54:35.315 --> 54:38.610
I know a place.
I'll take you there.

55:55.186 --> 55:59.190
This road leads
to an abandoned rocket dump.

55:59.482 --> 56:01.943
We'll be safe there.

56:50.742 --> 56:54.788
<i>I denounce the decision to de-Om
only once every three cycles.</i>

56:54.913 --> 56:58.750
<i>Recent events have shown
how ineffective that is!</i>

56:58.875 --> 57:01.669
<i>A Draag murdered!
Unbelievable!</i>

57:01.795 --> 57:05.590
<i>Are we so weak
that Oms can kill us so easily?</i>

57:06.007 --> 57:10.261
<i>Wild Oms are much more numerous
than we imagined.</i>

57:10.386 --> 57:14.057
<i>The body showed
numerous bites and wounds.</i>

57:14.182 --> 57:17.519
<i>According to the Draag
who managed to escape,</i>

57:17.644 --> 57:20.271
<i>there were
great numbers of Oms.</i>

57:23.525 --> 57:27.112
<i>The wild Oms are becoming
bolder by the day.</i>

57:27.278 --> 57:29.823
<i>They reproduce
at a terrifying rate!</i>

57:29.948 --> 57:33.284
<i>Master Sinh,
it's disturbing to note</i>

57:33.409 --> 57:35.954
<i>that the Uva of Télèze</i>

57:36.121 --> 57:41.251
<i>was not the only one
that was very difficult to de-Om.</i>

57:41.376 --> 57:42.836
<i>Two other Uvas,</i>

57:42.961 --> 57:45.672
<i>Goham and Urtana...</i>

57:45.797 --> 57:48.758
<i>have presented similar problems.</i>

57:48.883 --> 57:52.428
In the de-Omed park
near where the Draag was killed,

57:52.554 --> 57:55.765
we found two surprisingly
well-organized lairs.

57:55.890 --> 57:58.685
<i>Most disturbing
and inexplicable of all</i>

57:58.810 --> 58:00.895
<i>was that in one of them,</i>

58:01.020 --> 58:04.649
<i>boxes were sorted
according to their contents,</i>

58:04.774 --> 58:06.985
<i>yet they hadn't been opened!</i>

58:07.110 --> 58:10.488
<i>How could the Oms know
what they contained?</i>

58:10.738 --> 58:14.993
Master Sinh, it's high time
we take truly effective measures.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.413
I suggest we de-Om the parks
twice per cycle.

58:18.538 --> 58:23.418
I also request that the breeding
and sale of tame Oms

58:23.543 --> 58:25.920
be strictly regulated.

58:26.045 --> 58:28.548
Too often
they return to the wild

58:28.673 --> 58:32.218
and swell the numbers of Oms
living in the parks

58:32.343 --> 58:34.470
and other isolated areas.

58:34.596 --> 58:37.348
It's time to use
the new de-Oming weaponry

58:37.473 --> 58:39.475
we've heard so much about.

58:39.601 --> 58:41.978
All wild Oms
must be exterminated.

58:42.103 --> 58:43.980
And I ask you:

58:44.105 --> 58:46.900
Should we keep our tame Oms?

58:47.025 --> 58:51.613
You're wrong to consider Oms
as merely vicious animals.

58:51.738 --> 58:56.201
I fear we're committing an error
fraught with consequences.

59:28.399 --> 59:32.028
<i>Three seasons
had passed on Ygam,</i>

59:32.362 --> 59:35.114
<i>the equivalent
of 15 of our years.</i>

59:46.125 --> 59:49.420
<i>The Draag rocket graveyard
had long been abandoned,</i>

59:49.587 --> 59:51.839
<i>and there we built our city.</i>

59:52.090 --> 59:55.551
<i>But the Wild Planet
was where we wanted to go.</i>

59:55.760 --> 59:58.930
<i>Many Oms joined us,
both tame and wild.</i>

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:52.150
<i>The knowledge acquired
via the headset</i>

01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:55.820
<i>enabled us to use
sophisticated technology</i>

01:00:55.945 --> 01:00:59.073
<i>to reduce Draag
rocket components to our size.</i>

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:12.462
<i>“Trinur is a white metal
that palsifies matoir.</i>

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:17.300
<i>Careful reculidization gives it
an exceptional metallic sheen.”</i>

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:27.101
We've succeeded, Terr.

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:30.355
The first two rockets
are ready for testing.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.983
The others just need more time.
- We must hurry.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:37.028
Many tame Om informers
have warned us

01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:39.781
that there will be
a large-scale de-Omization.

01:01:39.906 --> 01:01:42.700
The Draags may know where we are.

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:14.185
We must send up
our two rockets at once

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:17.188
to see if the Wild Planet
will support life.

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:19.607
We can't wait any longer.

01:04:19.732 --> 01:04:23.194
It's a pity
I won't be going with you.

01:04:23.528 --> 01:04:27.198
But I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.

01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:31.035
I know you'll build a new world

01:04:31.202 --> 01:04:35.623
where Oms can be happy,
far away from the Draags.

01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:39.085
The Wild Planet will be our planet,

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.046
a world for our children.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:44.257
You must go.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:46.551
You must hurry.

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:48.553
You must...

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:38.788
<i>We had at last discovered
the Draags' secret.</i>

01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:41.499
<i>The Draags used
their meditation spheres</i>

01:06:41.624 --> 01:06:45.378
<i>to meet beings from other galaxies
on the Wild Planet</i>

01:06:45.503 --> 01:06:48.589
<i>and hold strange nuptial rites.</i>

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:54.095
<i>This union gave them
the vital energy they needed</i>

01:06:54.512 --> 01:06:57.848
<i>while also guaranteeing
the survival of their species.</i>

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.886
<i>We were gripped by fear.</i>

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:39.390
<i>The statues' huge feet
might crush our rockets.</i>

01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:51.736
<i>By chance we found
the Draags' only weak point.</i>

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:56.907
<i>The de-Omization
on Ygam was halted.</i>

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:44.287
<i>Never have the Draags
faced such great danger.</i>

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:47.582
<i>Our entire civilization is threatened!</i>

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.169
<i>The Oms are taking revenge!</i>

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:53.506
<i>They have amazing
scientific equipment!</i>

01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:57.551
<i>- They must be stopped!
- They must be exterminated!</i>

01:08:57.676 --> 01:09:00.261
<i>It may be too late.</i>

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.098
<i>Neither the Oms nor the Draags</i>

01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:06.100
<i>stand to gain
from mutual destruction.</i>

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:08.312
<i>We must try</i>

01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:10.814
<i>to make peace!</i>

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.667
<i>“Since the Sinh era,
the epoch of the Masters of Ygam,</i>

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:34.171
<i>the Draag civilization has
undergone a remarkable evolution.</i>

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:38.843
<i>Instructed in Draag
philosophy and technology,</i>

01:09:38.968 --> 01:09:41.636
<i>the Oms now provide the Draags</i>

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:45.015
<i>with a dynamic and vital
new way of thinking.</i>

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.768
<i>Our planet now has two satellites,</i>

01:09:47.893 --> 01:09:50.395
<i>one natural and one artificial.</i>

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.023
<i>The natural satellite,
the Wild Planet,</i>

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.068
<i>is reserved
for Draag meditation.</i>

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:59.321
<i>The artificial satellite
was created by the Oms,</i>

01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:01.532
<i>and they called it Terr.</i>

01:10:01.657 --> 01:10:05.369
<i>The Oms live in huge cities
on the various Uvas...”</i>
