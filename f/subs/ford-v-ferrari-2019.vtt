WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.671
(drumroll)

00:06.799 --> 00:09.217
(fanfare playing)

00:21.438 --> 00:22.897
(music ends)

00:24.858 --> 00:28.194
(engines revving)

00:28.779 --> 00:30.738
(crowd cheering)

00:45.087 --> 00:47.380
(commentator speaking French)

00:47.464 --> 00:51.134
(overlapping announcements
in foreign language)

00:53.679 --> 00:55.031
COMMENTATOR (in English):
This is live coverage

00:55.055 --> 00:57.724
of the 195924 Hours of Le Mans.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.475
We've reached the halfway point

00:59.560 --> 01:01.978
and so far witnessed
Aston Martin number 5,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.646
driven by Carroll Shelby,

01:03.731 --> 01:05.773
making great gains in the last hour.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.567
If he keeps this pace up,

01:07.651 --> 01:08.985
he could have a chance at the...

01:09.069 --> 01:11.070
(engine revving)

01:26.420 --> 01:27.587
He's coming in.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.089
He's coming in. Let's go, let's go.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.026
- CREW MEMBER: Tires!
- EDDIE: Let's go, let's go.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.361
I know you're tired, but come on,

01:33.385 --> 01:34.302
let's make this fast.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.720
Move, move, move!

01:35.804 --> 01:37.013
(tires screech)

01:37.973 --> 01:39.367
She's running a little hot,
but we're good.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.933
CARROLL: Tires are still gripping.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.287
CREW MEMBERS: Fire! The fuel! Fire!

01:42.311 --> 01:44.151
- Shelby, it's you!
- EDDIE: Grab that blanket!

01:44.354 --> 01:45.688
(indistinct shouting)

01:45.773 --> 01:47.398
CARROLL: Get off me! Off!

01:49.860 --> 01:51.027
EDDIE: You okay?

01:53.655 --> 01:54.864
Fill the tank!

01:56.658 --> 01:58.618
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.121
Am I on goddamn fire?

02:02.206 --> 02:03.683
- No, you're not on fire.
- Fill the damn tank!

02:03.707 --> 02:05.018
- CREW MEMBER 1: Fill the tank.
- EDDIE: Fill the tank.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.162
CREW MEMBER 2: Get it ready!

02:07.127 --> 02:09.462
- CARROLL: Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up, my friend.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.607
CREW MEMBER 4: Car's yours.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.006
EDDIE: Go get 'em.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.571
COMMENTATOR: Aston Martin number 5,

02:35.656 --> 02:38.074
driven by Carroll Shelby,
has maintained his lead

02:38.158 --> 02:40.451
as we're nearing
the final minutes of the race.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.661
DR. GRANGER: Shelby.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.496
COMMENTATOR: The checkered flag is out.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.957
The crowd are on their feet.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.186
- DR. GRANGER: Shelby.
- COMMENTATOR: takes the title!

02:48.210 --> 02:49.335
An American wins Le Mans.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.419
DR. GRANGER: Shelby.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.256
- (exhales)
- Carroll Shelby.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.632
What?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.884
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.136
Oh, I take the pills. The pills work.

02:59.221 --> 03:03.057
(sighs) An elevated
heart rate, say 130 BPM,

03:03.141 --> 03:05.309
sustained even for a short period,

03:05.394 --> 03:07.311
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.707
- Well, I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.316
Well, I could race NASCAR. Formula One.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.360
The valve is shot, Shelby.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.571
This is as serious as it gets.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.906
In my opinion, you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.951
(scoffs) Well, I feel real lucky.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.037
Luckiest guy on Earth.

03:43.307 --> 03:49.145
CARROLL: There's a point at 7,000 RPM
where everything fades.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.981
- (keys jingling)
- (car engine starts)

03:58.071 --> 04:00.698
The machine becomes weightless.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.116
Just disappears.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.701
- (tires screeching)
- (horn blaring)

04:03.785 --> 04:04.785
MAN: Hey!

04:05.579 --> 04:06.746
MAN 2: Watch it, buddy!

04:11.209 --> 04:15.880
CARROLL: And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.763
7,000 RPM.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.849
That's where you meet it.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.355
It asks you a question.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.847
The only question that matters.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.779
"Who are you?"

04:46.912 --> 04:50.039
Now, it's Von Trips in the Ferrari,
coming into the corkscrew.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.101
- He's braking late.
- WAYNE: Hey, I called you three times,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.353
and you never answer the phone.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.585
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

04:54.711 --> 04:55.980
KEN: I answer the phone
every time it rings.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.482
- WAYNE: No, sir, you do not.
- KEN: Yes, I do.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.506
WAYNE: No, you don't.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.508
A month ago, this car was fine.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.804
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does,

05:04.888 --> 05:06.138
it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

05:06.932 --> 05:08.683
When I pull out of the driveway,

05:08.767 --> 05:11.227
- the dog has a heart attack.
- (Ken chuckles)

05:11.311 --> 05:13.331
WAYNE: All I'm asking is for
you to make it like it was.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.983
(grunting) Yeah, you've coked up
the inlet valves and the plugs.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.275
Nothing wrong with the car,

05:18.360 --> 05:19.462
just the way it's being driven.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.630
WAYNE: The way it's being driven?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.007
KEN: Too much fuel, not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.471
You wanna run that by me in English?

05:26.827 --> 05:27.910
All right, sir.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.288
So... (exhales)

05:31.373 --> 05:34.583
that there, that is a sport car.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.752
You have to drive her like a sport car.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.629
If you drive her like a school teacher,

05:38.714 --> 05:40.089
she'll clog up. All right?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.551
Try changing up at 5,000 RPM, not two.

05:43.635 --> 05:47.638
Drive like you mean it. Hard and tight.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.056
She'll run clean.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.852
Are you telling me I don't know
how to drive my own car?

05:54.229 --> 05:55.229
No.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.250
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.985
Your car's more a Plymouth
or a Studebaker.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.266
You and me have a problem, buddy?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.218
I don't have a problem. I had an MG.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.617
Mine ran just fine.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.244
Screw you, you limey prick.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.620
I want my money back.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.956
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.418
But you haven't paid
for last month's service yet.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.586
This country, the customer's always right.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.897
- (Ken scoffs)
- You ever hear of that?

06:19.921 --> 06:22.131
- KEN: Yeah. Yeah.
- (car engine starts)

06:22.215 --> 06:23.674
Utter nonsense.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.469
Now remember, I advanced the timing,

06:26.553 --> 06:29.555
- so a smidge twitchy in first.
- (tires screeching)

06:29.639 --> 06:32.516
Get the revs up. Good lad. Revs up.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.310
(horn honking)

06:34.394 --> 06:35.519
Ta-Ra.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.899
MOLLIE: Another satisfied customer?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.445
Can I help you, miss?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.365
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.703
Ah, you know your cars.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.163
Well, I like them.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.373
I love the sound they make.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.042
The way it goes right through you.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.418
Right.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.921
That vibration.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.090
(exhales)

07:04.174 --> 07:07.885
Mine's the wood-paneled

07:07.969 --> 07:09.929
Country Squire... (clicks tongue)

07:10.013 --> 07:11.514
across the street.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.059
A real hot rod.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.268
Oh, yeah?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.270
- Is it fast?
- Very.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.773
Wait a second. What type of girl are ya?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.901
Type of girl who likes
the smell of wet gasoline.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.402
- KEN: Oh.
- Burnt rubber.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.739
Oh, what, are you some kind of a deviant,
are ya? (chuckles)

07:29.282 --> 07:30.866
Well, only since I married you.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.366
LEE: Hey, Gar, what's going on?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.418
Something's up.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.255
MAN 1: Hi, Lee.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.659
MAN 2: Listen, he isn't as sure as you are
about the banks.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.908
MAN 3: I'm not as sure about this...

07:50.929 --> 07:52.555
MAN 4: How's this going out?

07:55.517 --> 07:58.185
- Don, what's going on?
- I don't know.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.125
- MAN 5: Mr. Ford, welcome to the room.
- MAN 6: Good afternoon, Mr. Ford.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.274
MAN 6: Nice to see you, sir.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.484
(chatter stops)

08:08.572 --> 08:09.947
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.951
(machinery whirring)

08:16.913 --> 08:17.913
LEO: John!

08:21.042 --> 08:24.170
- (alarm buzzing)
- FOREMAN: All stop.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.963
(machinery powering down)

08:35.223 --> 08:36.473
Hear that?

08:39.352 --> 08:43.314
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company...

08:44.024 --> 08:45.900
out of business.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.911
In 1899, my grandfather,
Henry, by God, Ford...

08:57.329 --> 09:00.539
was walking home from Edison Illumination

09:00.624 --> 09:02.833
after working a double shift.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.335
He was ruminating.

09:05.045 --> 09:09.882
That morning, he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

09:10.550 --> 09:15.804
Sixty-five years
and 47 million automobiles later,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.723
what shall be his legacy?

09:20.060 --> 09:23.395
Getting it in the tail pipe
from a Chevy Impala.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.981
(all chuckling)

09:28.318 --> 09:29.944
Here's what I want you to do.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.612
Walk home.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.953
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.790
Man comes to my office with an idea,

09:42.874 --> 09:45.334
that man keeps his job.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.004
Rest of you second-best losers...

09:49.965 --> 09:51.257
stay home.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.175
You don't belong at Ford.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.355
- PHIL: Shelby!
- (knocking at door)

10:07.774 --> 10:10.317
I see you. Up and at 'em, buddy.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.028
(knocking on window)

10:13.113 --> 10:14.613
- Hey!
- CARROLL: Go away.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.573
PHIL: Come on. You can do it.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.158
(Carroll coughing)

10:18.243 --> 10:19.535
PHIL: Come on, baby.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.870
- 8:30 a.m., time to roll.
- (continues knocking)

10:21.955 --> 10:22.955
Let's go.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.708
- Let's go. Let's go, go, go.
- Go away.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.043
PHIL: It's 8:30 a.m., baby. Time to roll.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.671
Come on.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.756
BOB: Hey, Phil.

10:32.841 --> 10:33.841
Hey, Bob.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.175
Is Shelby here?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.052
Uh, it's touch and go.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.179
(door unlocking)

10:43.018 --> 10:45.311
Shelby, you're up bright and early.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.480
Well, early bird gets the worm, Pops.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.943
♪ You know the best things
in life are free ♪

10:53.028 --> 10:54.380
CARROLL: All right, who you worried about?

10:54.404 --> 10:57.323
Well, you got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.907
They're all in 327s.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.617
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.328
Bondurant? Well, he's still driving...

11:02.412 --> 11:04.572
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?
- For Washburn.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.749
Number 614.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.437
- Thank you so much.
- All right, just relax. All right.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.378
We're gonna eat those Vettes
for breakfast.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.921
We're lighter, we're faster,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.631
and that don't work, we're nastier.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.217
COMMENTATOR (on PA): Hey, Dad,
before the race starts,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.136
take your son over
to the Willow Springs...

11:19.220 --> 11:22.181
CARROLL: Hey, Phil. Hey,
take it easy on us today, bud.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.561
KEN: You all right?

11:27.645 --> 11:30.647
Paragraph 15.4,
section 2b of the SCCA standard

11:30.732 --> 11:33.108
dictates all AF class cars must have

11:33.193 --> 11:35.736
minimum trunk space
of 20 inches by 12 inches

11:35.820 --> 11:36.945
by six inches.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.947
Your trunk doesn't close.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.283
- Ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.786
Ergo car is disqualified
from said Class A competition.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.497
No, no, no. Look, look, look.
Can I ask you a question, all right?

11:46.581 --> 11:49.333
When you were a little boy, did you think,

11:49.417 --> 11:53.712
"When I grow up, I want to go
to the fabled Willow Springs Raceway,

11:53.797 --> 11:56.548
"and I want to enforce
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

11:56.633 --> 11:59.218
of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity"?

11:59.302 --> 12:00.886
- All right, that's it.
- KEN: Did you?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.098
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.768
CARROLL: Ah, well,
if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.728
- LANCE: Ah, Shelby.
- How you doing, Lance?

12:09.813 --> 12:10.896
- LANCE: Pops.
- Hey, Lance.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.834
Allow me to introduce Dieter Voss.
Runs Brumos Porsche out of Jacksonville.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.567
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.986
You're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.863
Seeing results for your Cobra, too.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.907
- Thank you.
- Your guy Miles is impressive.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.659
- Oh, you following Miles?
- Oh, yes.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.537
Well, he was a USAC
road racing champ in '61.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.996
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.791
He was SCCA C-class champion
three years in a row

12:30.875 --> 12:33.001
in his piece-of-shit MG he built himself.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.878
We heard he's, uh, difficult.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.964
What, Ken? No, no. Ken's a puppy dog.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.133
Hey, Lance, tell the man.
You've raced against Ken.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.677
Oh, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.765
Well, Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.536
- Is that right?
- KEN: How is that even possible?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.227
Think your guy Miles can make the grade?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.104
- Oh, well, Ken...
- KEN: Is he, mate? Hey!

12:52.439 --> 12:55.107
Jim! Is he putting his bloody carryall

12:55.191 --> 12:56.400
- in your trunk?
- JIM: What?

12:56.484 --> 12:57.670
BILL: Discretionary infraction.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.111
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.573
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

13:03.700 --> 13:08.787
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.040
You're holding
the '62 edition of the SCCA.

13:13.543 --> 13:18.005
And you can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun don't shine.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.025
Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems
to be the problem, Bill?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.676
The problem is that
Bill here is an arsehole.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.156
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.907
- No, he really does think...
- He's just fooling with ya, Bill.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.742
- That Bill is an arsehole.
- He's just foolin'.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.703
- I'm just doing my job here.
- Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.853
In my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.707
Something like this, there's
always a middle ground.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.875
All right? Now, Ken's outta line.

13:35.899 --> 13:36.959
BILL: And I'm just doing my job.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.043
CARROLL: I understand you are.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.128
You know how he gets on a race day.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.277
You know that. All right?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.961
But you're not gonna DQ us over a trunk.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.864
(grunting)

13:48.870 --> 13:50.996
- MAN 1: What?
- MAN 2: You see that guy?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.164
Got his tail up.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.541
(continues grunting)

13:59.547 --> 14:00.547
Happy, Bill?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.927
CARROLL: Bill, I'll handle it.
I'll talk to him.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.471
I'll talk to him. You just go
and have a great day.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.598
COMMENTATOR (on PA):
Hey, folks, feeling hungry?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.308
Head on over to the snack bar...

14:11.684 --> 14:12.684
Shit.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.520
- Bulldog.
- KEN: Huh?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.833
You know who that was
I was just talking to?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.899
Bill.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.317
- Before that.
- No.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.236
It was Dieter Voss.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.403
KEN: Who's that?

14:24.531 --> 14:26.406
He runs Porsche, Ken.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.469
It's a little German car company.
Maybe you heard of it.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.576
All right.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.119
He wanted you to drive at Sebring.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.788
But he'd heard you were difficult.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.582
(sighs)

14:38.253 --> 14:43.257
I thought we felt the same way
about, uh, Germans.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.304
Do you like losing, Ken?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.307
Excuse me?

14:52.767 --> 14:53.767
Oh, you heard me.

14:54.978 --> 14:55.978
I don't lose.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.357
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.109
And last I checked, the professionals

15:02.193 --> 15:03.860
- all have a car.
- Shel!

15:03.945 --> 15:06.154
You cannot win the SCCA without one.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.156
If you're not winning, you are losing.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.409
Don't make me lamp this at your head.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.845
Did you bring your son
all the way out here

15:11.869 --> 15:13.036
to watch you get disqualified

15:13.121 --> 15:14.496
or just act like a jackass?

15:14.872 --> 15:15.872
(glass shatters)

15:16.583 --> 15:18.292
(people exclaiming and laughing)

15:18.960 --> 15:19.960
MAN: Damn!

15:23.298 --> 15:24.756
Well, that answers that.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.901
(sighs) Peter...

15:47.155 --> 15:48.447
(car approaching)

15:53.953 --> 15:55.787
MOLLIE: May I help you, gentlemen?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.372
MAN: Uh, yes, is Ken Miles here?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.250
- No.
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.585
I'm his wife.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.464
COMMENTATOR (on PA): Welcome to the 1963
Willow Springs 100.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.508
Twelve cars will be competing
in this 40-lap race.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.803
Hey, Ken, what happened to your shield?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.723
New design.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.995
COMMENTATOR: Well, it looks
like we're about to begin.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.978
The cars have completed their warm-up lap.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.521
The green flag is out...

16:22.940 --> 16:25.067
and they're approaching the starting line.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.860
Here we go.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.906
- (engine sputters)
- Oh, bloody hell.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.134
COMMENTATOR: Ken Miles has fallen behind.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.372
Learn to drive, you pillock!

16:44.420 --> 16:45.796
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.675
Hey, Sam.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.970
Guy wins the 24-hour Le Mans,
suddenly retires,

16:54.597 --> 16:55.931
starts selling cars.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.517
It just don't make sense.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.644
Well, unless the rumors
are true, of course.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.146
Oh, what rumors would those be, Sam?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.846
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.944
(engines revving)

17:12.699 --> 17:15.575
I'm gonna out-brake you
on the next turn, Bob.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.709
(tires screeching)

17:26.546 --> 17:29.214
Ha-ha! Nice try, Bob.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.844
(crowd cheering)

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
(tires screeching)

17:47.275 --> 17:48.585
COMMENTATOR: Nice move from Ken Miles.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.570
Twenty-two laps remaining,
with Phil Hill and Dan Gurney in the lead.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.789
(breathing heavily)

18:05.042 --> 18:07.627
- (thud)
- (tires screeching)

18:14.802 --> 18:17.554
COMMENTATOR: It's been an incredible day
here at Willow Springs,

18:17.638 --> 18:19.514
and we've seen some exciting driving.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.185
With just one lap remaining
in this 40-lap race,

18:23.269 --> 18:25.061
we're coming to the final stretch.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.773
Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for most of the...

18:27.857 --> 18:29.316
- (tires screech)
- Whoa!

18:29.400 --> 18:30.525
(crowd exclaims)

18:30.610 --> 18:33.111
Number 18, Red Faris,
is off the track.

18:33.196 --> 18:37.115
That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead
followed by journeyman Ken Miles.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.036
Now for you, Dan.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.353
COMMENTATOR: And they're
coming around the last turn.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.254
Gurney is still in the lead
with Ken Miles hot on his heels.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.722
Miles is looking for an opening.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.807
Not yet.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.642
Come on.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.830
COMMENTATOR: Can Gurney hold
him off in the final straight?

19:06.854 --> 19:07.854
Not yet.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.208
COMMENTATOR: Gurney is blocking him out.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.276
Now.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.801
COMMENTATOR: Miles goes for the shoulder.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.825
Nice move, Ken.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.641
COMMENTATOR: They're wheel to wheel.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.082
Come on.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.168
COMMENTATOR: It's Corvette versus Cobra
for the finish.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.798
- Yeah! Ha-ha!
- (crowd cheering)

19:34.882 --> 19:35.966
Yeah!

19:36.843 --> 19:39.177
COMMENTATOR: An incredible
finish for Ken Miles.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.681
- Didn't see that one coming.
- (Ken whooping)

19:43.558 --> 19:45.433
He's difficult but good.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.144
COMMENTATOR: Let's give everyone a hand
for one heck of a race.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.897
KEN: That calls for a nice cup of tea.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.524
PETER: I'll put the kettle on.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.608
Hop in.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.948
(singing):
♪ I'm ♪

20:00.032 --> 20:01.950
BOTH:
♪ H-A-P-P-Y ♪

20:02.034 --> 20:04.119
♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪

20:04.203 --> 20:08.039
♪ I know I am,
I'm sure I am I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪

20:10.293 --> 20:11.835
Pops, frame this.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.674
(Ken whistling)

20:17.758 --> 20:19.593
(dog barking in distance)

20:24.223 --> 20:25.223
(whispering) Hey.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.143
We did it.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.855
What's wrong?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.150
The IRS came.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.485
They've padlocked the garage.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.363
(sighs)

20:42.950 --> 20:44.451
KEN: All right, Petey.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.798
A couple of years ago...

21:00.009 --> 21:01.551
you said we'd a nest egg.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.261
Correct.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.222
A couple of years ago.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.474
Correct.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.773
So just to be clear, we are buggered.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.858
Absolutely.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.866
As in totally?

21:25.660 --> 21:30.789
As in, not a bean,
or a pot in which to piss.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.750
Spares, stock, all gone.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.086
Tools. My tools are locked up in there.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.381
I'll figure something out.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.717
LEE: In 1945...

21:42.802 --> 21:44.678
our soldiers came home.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.555
What was the first thing that they did?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.599
(projector clicking)

21:49.684 --> 21:51.393
- They had sex.
- (all laugh)

21:52.395 --> 21:53.645
Seventeen years later,

21:54.105 --> 21:55.855
those babies, they've grown.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.190
And they've got jobs.

21:57.775 --> 21:58.858
They've got licenses.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.196
But they do not wanna drive
the same dull '50s cars

22:03.280 --> 22:04.614
their parents drove.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.993
You see, kids today, they want glamour.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.328
They want sex appeal.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.413
They want to go fast.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.289
Gentlemen...

22:14.083 --> 22:17.293
it's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.256
We're already in racing, lacocca.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.174
LEE: NASCAR?

22:23.259 --> 22:25.343
It's... it's regional, sir.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.097
If you go to the movies,
you open up a magazine,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.516
you don't see good ol' boys
and Winston-Salem.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.018
You see, uh...

22:33.894 --> 22:35.395
Sophia Loren...

22:35.479 --> 22:36.563
(man wolf whistles)

22:36.647 --> 22:37.856
LEE: Monica Vitti.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.482
MAN: Hello!

22:40.901 --> 22:44.029
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.448
That's because he's a degenerate.

22:47.658 --> 22:48.867
(all chuckling)

22:50.244 --> 22:51.327
FORD: See?

22:51.954 --> 22:53.288
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.768
Um, just give me one second here, sir.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.477
- (projector whirring)
- Is this part of it?

22:57.501 --> 22:59.544
Is this going anywhere, lacocca?

22:59.628 --> 23:00.795
LEE: Just a second, sir.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.024
FORD: All right, all right,
that's enough.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.066
Sir, if you just bear with me...

23:03.090 --> 23:04.130
FORD: Turn it off. Lights.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.385
(Lee clears throat)

23:08.721 --> 23:13.975
Lee, in the last three years,
you and your marketing team...

23:14.560 --> 23:18.855
have presided over the worst
sales slump in US history.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.027
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

23:27.114 --> 23:28.865
Because we've been thinking wrong.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.411
Ferrari.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.040
Now, they have won four
out of the last five Le Mans.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.460
We need to think like Ferrari.

23:41.212 --> 23:45.590
Ferrari makes fewer cars
in a year than we make in a day.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.510
(chuckles) We spend more on toilet paper

23:48.594 --> 23:50.887
than they do on their entire output.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.848
You want us to think like them?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.809
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

23:55.893 --> 23:57.977
as the greatest
car manufacturer of all time.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.480
Why?

24:01.524 --> 24:04.400
Is it because he built the most cars?

24:06.362 --> 24:07.403
No.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.281
It's because of what his cars mean.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.784
Victory.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.203
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.081
People, they, they want
some of that victory.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.878
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

24:24.588 --> 24:25.880
And meant it where it counts,

24:25.965 --> 24:28.341
with the first group
of 17-year-olds in history

24:28.425 --> 24:29.759
with money in their pockets?

24:29.844 --> 24:31.427
LEO: This would take years.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.972
Decades to test and develop...

24:34.765 --> 24:37.392
a race team capable of taking out Ferrari.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.810
Ferrari's bankrupt.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.899
Enzo has spent every lira
he's got chasing perfection,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.151
and you know something?

24:46.235 --> 24:47.485
He got there.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.404
But now he's broke.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.462
(loud clattering)

25:06.547 --> 25:07.964
(dog barking)

25:14.221 --> 25:16.681
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

25:16.765 --> 25:17.807
I think I do.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.100
Now, I've had my fun.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.186
It's time to put food on the table...

25:21.270 --> 25:22.312
and grow up.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.676
The garage didn't pay the bills.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.898
Now it's locked up.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.524
Racing doesn't pay them either,

25:26.609 --> 25:27.692
and I keep winning.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.152
Yeah, because you're good.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.529
But I can't play the game.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.365
I'm not what they call a people person.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.530
- MOLLIE: You don't say.
- KEN: And I'm 45 years old.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.077
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

25:38.162 --> 25:40.997
I'm never gonna get the good rise.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.248
I started too late.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.833
Because you fought in the bloody war.

25:44.919 --> 25:48.922
(sighs) If you stop,
you'll be bloody insufferable.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.301
Let's quit going round
the Wrekin. It's over.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.720
Let's look on the bright side.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.557
Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses, and eat pork pies.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.017
- (camera shutter clicks)
- Uh, scusa.

26:22.456 --> 26:23.915
Please, no photos.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.166
Prego.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.960
- Relax, will you?
- You gotta understand.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.213
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.737
DON: Kind of the opposite, actually.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.884
The press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.470
Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.180
Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.766
(speaking Italian)

26:41.850 --> 26:42.767
(in English) Journalists?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.686
No, no, Mr. lacocca, no.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.271
It's our cameras.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.563
Just for history.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.608
(camera shutter clicks)

26:50.693 --> 26:52.694
Four-liter Colombo engine.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.404
(machinery whirring)

26:54.488 --> 26:58.074
One man assembles the entire engine
by himself.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.829
Another man assembles the transmission.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.415
Everything hand-built.

27:06.917 --> 27:07.917
Bellissimo.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.179
(speaking Italian)

27:21.557 --> 27:23.057
(in English)
Racing Department.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.894
Lee. That's him.

27:32.359 --> 27:35.778
LEE: This merger between our companies
will form two entities.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.115
(woman translating to Italian)

27:39.533 --> 27:42.327
LEE (in English): Ford-Ferrari,
90 percent owned by Ford,

27:42.411 --> 27:43.703
who controls all production.

27:44.038 --> 27:48.875
(translating to Italian)

27:48.959 --> 27:52.211
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford, the race team,

27:52.296 --> 27:53.963
90 percent owned by Ferrari.

27:54.423 --> 27:59.302
(translating to Italian)

27:59.386 --> 28:03.389
In order to secure this,
Ford will pay the sum...

28:04.433 --> 28:07.602
(translating to Italian)

28:07.686 --> 28:10.438
(speaking Italian)

28:31.418 --> 28:32.668
(in English) Excuse me.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.923
(speaking Italian)

28:37.591 --> 28:39.717
(in English) He will need
some time to read this.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.219
Ah. Please.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.848
Ah. Yeah, of course.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.191
(woman shouting in Italian)

29:06.078 --> 29:08.121
I'm looking for the chairman of Fiat!

29:08.330 --> 29:10.081
Agnelli!

29:10.833 --> 29:13.000
I have photographs for you to see.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.046
Grazie, grazie, grazie.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.424
(phone ringing)

29:20.342 --> 29:23.344
Pronto.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.470
Yes, I am here.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.058
Do you have something to say?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.353
Enzo maintains full control.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.107
I get the company for 18 million.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.860
(waitress speaks in Italian)

29:38.944 --> 29:40.528
(in English) All done, thank you.

29:51.165 --> 29:56.127
(speaking Italian)

29:56.211 --> 29:58.523
GARY (translating to English): "Gentlemen,
only one small question.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.707
It concerns my race program."

30:00.924 --> 30:05.303
(speaking Italian)

30:09.641 --> 30:12.059
(translating to English)
"If I wish to race Le Mans,

30:12.144 --> 30:14.020
"and you do not wish
for me to race Le Mans...

30:14.646 --> 30:16.230
do we or do we not go?"

30:22.321 --> 30:23.529
(Lee clears throat)

30:24.364 --> 30:28.075
Look, in that highly unlikely scenario...

30:29.703 --> 30:31.496
if we just can't agree...

30:32.122 --> 30:33.873
then, yes. I mean, no.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.542
You are correct.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.669
You do not go.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.797
(conversing in Italian)

30:46.428 --> 30:50.973

30:58.482 --> 30:59.857
"as a man, as an Italian,

is deeply insulted by your proposal."

31:01.652 --> 31:03.194
(Ferrari speaking Italian)

31:03.278 --> 31:04.839
GARY (translating to English):

(translating to English)
"Tell your pigheaded boss that

31:25.968 --> 31:30.972
all his, uh, smug executives
are worthless sons of whores."

31:33.767 --> 31:36.227
(in English) Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.648
He's Henry Ford ll.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.192
(speaking Italian)

31:43.610 --> 31:45.152
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.635
He played us.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.930
Old Man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.098
(pouring drink)

32:14.182 --> 32:16.684
He used us to up his price...

32:17.394 --> 32:19.854
embarrass our company
and insult your leadership.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.648
It was a bad idea from the start.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.367
What exactly did he say?

32:41.585 --> 32:43.377
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,

32:43.462 --> 32:44.629
and we make 'em...

32:45.547 --> 32:46.922
in an ugly factory.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.178
He said our executives are sons of whores.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.224
About me?

32:59.311 --> 33:00.728
He called you fat, sir.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.314
And, uh...

33:03.774 --> 33:04.899
pigheaded.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.443
Go on.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.571
He said you're not Henry Ford.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.240
You're Henry Ford ll.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.100
I want the best engineers.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.561
The best drivers.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.732
I don't care what it costs.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.862
We're gonna build a race car.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.536
(glass thuds)

33:58.620 --> 34:01.288
And we're gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

34:01.373 --> 34:05.000
100 feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.046
And I will be there to watch it.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.049
Here they come. Go, go, go, go.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.820
- (firecrackers bursting)
- (girls screaming)

34:13.844 --> 34:15.594
(both laughing)

34:16.012 --> 34:17.012
Assholes.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.264
You're really pathetic.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.265
I'm so sorry, girls.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.683
PHIL: Charlie!

34:20.767 --> 34:22.768
Quit throwing crackers
at the girls all damn day.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.103
God damn it.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.271
Do I gotta deal with this?

34:25.355 --> 34:26.731
It's already taken care of.

34:28.108 --> 34:32.278
Sorry about that.
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

34:32.362 --> 34:33.571
Far out.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.489
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.575
And a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.076
How's she handle a quarter mile?

34:39.703 --> 34:41.912
Well, now, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing,

34:41.997 --> 34:43.581
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.957
- (whistles)
- Yeah.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.561
- Is that good?
- Oh, that's real good.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.545
He sold that same car
three times this week.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.881
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.235
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself
one hell of a sport car.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.426
MAN: All right.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.263
Tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil!

34:59.347 --> 35:00.783
I'm gonna pass you off
to my colleague here.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.974
He gonna take care of you.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.976
- Phil, Wyatt.
- Hello, Wyatt.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.460
I'm gonna steal him for one second.

35:06.563 --> 35:07.813
You take the payment.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.698
Whatever you do,
do not let him take that car.

35:09.733 --> 35:10.983
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.068
And Frank Collins' and Steve McQueen's.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.112
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.325
Morning.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.035
Can I help you?

35:22.412 --> 35:23.537
Carroll Shelby?

35:24.748 --> 35:25.748
Maybe.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.627
Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.381
- What's with the wrench?
- (door closes)

35:35.050 --> 35:36.842
That? Oh, long story.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.679
We are just going from strength
to strength here, Lee.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.016
Terrific sales,
we're killing it on the track.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.769
Now, I know I owe Ford
for that last batch of engines...

35:46.853 --> 35:49.522
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you
I'm not here for money

35:49.606 --> 35:51.524
that you might owe Ford for spare parts.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.193
You're not?

35:54.861 --> 35:56.320
No, I'm not.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.656
Okay.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.492
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford ll.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.203
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

36:04.287 --> 36:08.249
that he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.586
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it...

36:12.671 --> 36:13.879
so I'm wondering...

36:14.798 --> 36:15.923
what's it take?

36:19.469 --> 36:20.594
Hypothetically?

36:21.805 --> 36:23.055
Hypothetically.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.183
It takes something money can't buy.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.853
Money can buy speed.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.106
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.192
It's not just like those other tracks

36:35.277 --> 36:38.153
where all you do is turn
to the left for four hours.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.366
To win that race, you need a car

36:42.450 --> 36:44.660
that's light enough to do 200
on the straightaways

36:44.744 --> 36:47.830
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3,000 miles without a break.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.876
- (knock at door)
- Not just the best car

36:51.960 --> 36:53.760
y'all have ever made,
but better than anything

36:53.837 --> 36:55.754
that Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.506
And that just gets you to the green flag.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.258
That's where your problems really start.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.095
(quietly) Is everything okay?

37:03.179 --> 37:05.097
(whispers) Go away.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.273
So you're saying it's challenging.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.944
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.947
Le Mans is eight and a half
miles of country road.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.785
It's narrow, ungraded, it's rough.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.663
There's no camber on the turns, no rails.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.126
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.338
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.716
That means night.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.178
Half that race is in the dark.
You can't see shit.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.973
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.394
Drivers stumbling around
the track, pouring blood.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.147
Maybe one of 'em's your friend. Maybe...

37:56.149 --> 37:57.441
Maybe he's on fire.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.278
You're exhausted, you're hungry...

38:01.905 --> 38:04.406
can't remember your name,
what country you're in.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.744
And all of a sudden, you realize
you're doing 198 on a straight.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.124
And if anything goes wrong...

38:15.210 --> 38:17.878
you blow a gasket, a five-cent washer...

38:18.546 --> 38:20.089
that's it, whole thing's over.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.508
Ferrari wins again.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.761
Just like he won last year
and the year before that.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.471
And the year before that.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.434
Yeah.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.228
It's challenging.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.022
So you don't think...

38:37.941 --> 38:39.400
that Ford Motor Company can build

38:39.484 --> 38:41.568
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.029
You think that we are incapable

38:44.489 --> 38:45.823
of winning an event like that?

38:46.366 --> 38:48.325
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

38:51.287 --> 38:54.748
Even if we wrote a, uh, blank check?

39:01.464 --> 39:04.341
What I'm saying is,
you can't buy a win, Lee.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.140
But maybe you could buy
the guy who gets you a shot.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.269
♪ Have love ♪

39:16.646 --> 39:18.897
♪ Whoa, baby, will travel ♪

39:21.151 --> 39:22.359
♪ Have love ♪

39:23.862 --> 39:25.988
♪ Whoa, baby, will travel... ♪

39:28.450 --> 39:32.828
A new transmission, axles,
shocks all around,

39:32.912 --> 39:35.998
ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.418
Anything on this beauty that does work?

39:39.502 --> 39:42.129
The mirrors are outstanding.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.464
I saw that walking up.

39:44.466 --> 39:48.594
So, what, you just passing
on an evening stroll?

39:49.512 --> 39:52.097
Actually, Bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

39:52.182 --> 39:56.143
You're gonna build a car
to beat Old Man Ferrari...

39:56.227 --> 39:57.978
- Yeah.
- With Ford?

39:58.063 --> 40:00.272
With a Ford?

40:00.356 --> 40:01.648
Correct.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.650
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.277
Two, three hundred years?

40:05.737 --> 40:06.779
Ninety days.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.198
(laughing)

40:11.034 --> 40:13.702
All right, so let's just look
at this for a moment.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.330
And for argument's sake,

40:16.414 --> 40:18.791
let's just forget about
the whole 90-day thing, all right?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.519
So let's just pretend you've got
all the money in the world

40:20.543 --> 40:22.628
and all the time in the world.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.379
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

40:24.464 --> 40:25.506
So...

40:26.257 --> 40:28.884
you think that Ford
are gonna let you build

40:29.928 --> 40:32.429
the car that you want...

40:33.139 --> 40:34.848
the way you want it?

40:34.933 --> 40:37.643
The Ford Motor Company?

40:38.937 --> 40:40.062
Those guys?

40:41.397 --> 40:42.597
Have you ever been to Detroit?

40:42.649 --> 40:45.651
I mean, they have
floors and floors of lawyers

40:45.735 --> 40:48.821
and millions of marketing guys,
and they're all gonna want to meet you.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.382
All of them are gonna want
to get their photo taken

40:50.406 --> 40:52.551
with the great Carroll Shelby,
and they're gonna kiss your ass

40:52.575 --> 40:54.655
then they're gonna go
back to their lovely offices...

40:54.911 --> 40:56.954
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.706
Why? Because they can't help it.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.500
Because they just want
to please their boss

41:01.584 --> 41:04.461
who wants to please his boss
who wants to please his boss.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.589
And they hate themselves for it.

41:07.674 --> 41:09.341
But deep down...

41:09.425 --> 41:12.678
who they hate even more
are guys like you,

41:12.762 --> 41:14.138
because you're not like them,

41:14.222 --> 41:15.806
because you don't think like them,

41:15.890 --> 41:17.641
because you're different.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.853
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

41:23.523 --> 41:26.066
He's serious.
They're gonna put real money behind it.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.484
(exhales forcefully)

41:29.737 --> 41:30.904
I'll bet they are.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.490
You know why?

41:33.575 --> 41:36.118
Because someone, and I'm not saying who,

41:36.202 --> 41:41.874
someone has told them that
this is actually possible.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.417
Look...

41:43.501 --> 41:45.210
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

41:45.295 --> 41:46.522
they're launching the new Mustang.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.146
They're gonna announce the race program.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.591
Just come on by.

41:52.886 --> 41:55.470
Come take a look. Listen to my speech.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.181
I'm making a speech.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.516
- Bring Peter. He'll love it.
- (chuckles)

42:01.144 --> 42:03.061
- All right, Shel.
- (knocks on table)

42:05.398 --> 42:06.857
See you Sunday.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.445
Whoa.

42:12.238 --> 42:15.032
Dad, look at that.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.367
Huh.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.371
The Ford Mustang. What do you think?

42:24.876 --> 42:26.710
I think it's a secretary's car.

42:28.630 --> 42:29.880
I like it.

42:31.758 --> 42:32.758
Oh.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.426
Excu... Excuse me.

42:36.346 --> 42:37.721
Would you, would you not do that?

42:38.431 --> 42:40.390
Oh. Sorry.

42:43.686 --> 42:46.230
Oh, er, is this, is this your son?

42:47.106 --> 42:48.523
Yes, it is.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.026
Would you ask him to keep
his hands off the paintwork?

42:51.736 --> 42:54.321
No, no, no, Peter.
You're okay. Who are you?

42:54.989 --> 42:55.989
Leo Beebe,

42:56.032 --> 42:57.760
senior executive vice president,
Ford Motor Company.

42:57.784 --> 42:58.825
Ah.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.078
I'm responsible for the launch
of the Mustang.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.914
Ah! At least now we know
who's responsible.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.040
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

43:05.124 --> 43:08.043
- Leo.
- It looks fantastic.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.380
But inside, it's a lump of lard
dressed up to fool the public.

43:11.464 --> 43:13.423
My advice is,

43:13.508 --> 43:16.718
lose the inline-six
and that idiotic three-speed,

43:16.803 --> 43:20.305
shorten the wheelbase,
somehow lose half a ton,

43:20.390 --> 43:21.640
and lower the price.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.724
Dad.

43:22.809 --> 43:25.435
But even then,
I'd still choose a Chevy Chevelle.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.147
And that's a fucking terrible car.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.330
CARROLL: How are we doing up there, Steve?

43:32.860 --> 43:34.403
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.571
CARROLL: Oh, yeah.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.283
You mind if I take a shot at the landing?

43:39.367 --> 43:40.427
- STEVE: Uh...
- (all laughing)

43:40.451 --> 43:41.576
No, no, no. I mean it.

43:41.661 --> 43:44.663
- I flew B-29s out of San Antone in '44.
- You're kidding.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.915
- I did.
- Okay.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.208
Carroll, what are you doing?

43:48.293 --> 43:49.853
- Does he know how to fly?
- LEE: Carroll.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.629
I had an instructor tell me, he said...

43:52.714 --> 43:54.965
Don, I would say it's probably
a good time to buckle up.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.849
"Do everybody a favor,
stay on the ground."

43:58.136 --> 43:59.428
That's a true story.

43:59.512 --> 44:00.762
- DON: Oh, no.
- LEE: Oh, shit.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.514
- God damn it.
- CARROLL: Here we go.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.809
(on speakers): This is the car
you never expected from Detroit.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.729
(crowd exclaiming, applauding)

44:08.813 --> 44:11.315
All right. Let's go.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.693
Not staying, Ken?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.738
Ah, it's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it?

44:17.822 --> 44:19.114
CHARLIE: Oh, here they come now.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.238
(airplane engines droning)

44:23.870 --> 44:26.455
- Wait. Are they crashing?
- Oh, Lord.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.040
Who's the pilot?

44:28.124 --> 44:29.750
My guess, Peter...

44:33.129 --> 44:34.338
it's someone we know.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.240
LEE: Everything all right up there?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.176
DON: Oh, no.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.469
- LEE: No!
- CARROLL: Hang on.

44:40.553 --> 44:43.138
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

44:43.222 --> 44:46.725
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- (tires screech)

44:46.809 --> 44:48.560
Tell you what, that's like riding a bike.

44:55.485 --> 44:56.818
Talk about making an entrance.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.653
- MAN 1: Shelby...
- PHIL: Good grief.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.258
- WOMAN 1: Shelby!
- MAN 2: All right!

45:00.323 --> 45:02.282
- MAN 3: Over here. Over here!
- WOMAN 2: Shelby!

45:02.617 --> 45:03.909
How y'all doing?

45:03.993 --> 45:05.179
WOMAN 3:
Can I get your autograph, please?

45:05.203 --> 45:06.472
MAN 4: Can I get your autograph, sir?

45:06.496 --> 45:07.871
LEE: Carroll, this is Roy Lunn.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.540
Old Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.709
Oh, hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

45:12.794 --> 45:14.127
Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.838
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee for this one.

45:16.923 --> 45:18.173
Hold that thought.

45:18.841 --> 45:19.716
CARROLL: Ah.

45:19.801 --> 45:21.218
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.720
(chuckles) You like that?
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

45:23.805 --> 45:25.282
- PETER: Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.391
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

45:28.393 --> 45:31.228
Well, we're gonna go
to Le Mans, that's for sure.

45:31.312 --> 45:33.457
And if we get across
that finish line first, we're gonna win.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.399
LEE: Carroll, allow me
to introduce Leo Beebe,

45:35.483 --> 45:37.567
senior vice president, Ford Motor.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.129
Oh, sure. Yeah. A pleasure, Mr. Beebe.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.714
- LEO: Thank you for coming.
- Say hello to Ken Miles

45:40.738 --> 45:41.905
- and his son, Peter.
- Yeah.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.408
- We've, um... we met.
- We, uh... we met.

45:45.243 --> 45:46.410
KEN: Yeah.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.203
Didn't we?

45:48.287 --> 45:50.080
So, um, well...

45:50.706 --> 45:52.666
I'll take Petey for some pop.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.210
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.962
- PETER: Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.214
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.009
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

46:04.178 --> 46:05.262
Yeah. Uh...

46:05.680 --> 46:08.473
Carroll, why don't we just
step this way for a second?

46:09.976 --> 46:12.394
(man speaking indistinctly over speakers)

46:15.398 --> 46:17.482
LEE: Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

46:17.567 --> 46:19.253
But there's gotta be
a sense of give-and-take

46:19.277 --> 46:20.485
between you and...

46:20.570 --> 46:21.945
you know.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.029
No, I don't.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.197
The group.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.449
"The group"?

46:25.533 --> 46:26.741
Senior creatives, Carroll.

46:26.826 --> 46:28.869
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

46:29.620 --> 46:30.787
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.665
'Cause up until this moment, right now,
I was comfortable.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.835
You should take a look
out there, Carroll. Hmm?

46:36.919 --> 46:38.211
What do you see?

46:38.713 --> 46:40.005
You know what I see?

46:40.089 --> 46:41.465
I see a machine.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.592
I see 10,000 moving parts,

46:43.676 --> 46:44.926
moving hopefully in harmony,

46:45.011 --> 46:46.595
and it's my job to make it so.

46:46.679 --> 46:48.073
It's my job to guide you through it.

46:48.097 --> 46:50.056
I am here to help you, Carroll.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.641
But you gotta trust me.

46:52.685 --> 46:53.935
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll...

46:54.812 --> 46:56.665
do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

46:56.689 --> 46:59.357
MAN (on PA):
Please welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.

46:59.442 --> 47:00.984
Gotta go.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.611
(crowd cheering)

47:03.738 --> 47:05.989
WOMAN: Shelby... Oh. Shelby.

47:07.617 --> 47:08.700
What'd he say?

47:08.784 --> 47:09.910
He gets the drill.

47:13.289 --> 47:14.664
CARROLL: Thank you.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.875
Well, if my daddy was here today...

47:17.585 --> 47:19.211
he'd tell me to sit on down

47:19.295 --> 47:21.838
and leave the yakking
to the college boys, so...

47:22.465 --> 47:24.466
like my cars, I'll make this fast.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.510
(crowd laughing)

47:27.136 --> 47:29.471
When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son...

47:30.348 --> 47:32.224
"it's a truly lucky man

47:32.308 --> 47:34.068
"who knows what he wants
to do in this world.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.686
'Cause that man will
never work a day in his life."

47:37.855 --> 47:40.482
But there are a few, a precious few,

47:40.566 --> 47:42.446
and, hell, I don't know
if they're lucky or not.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.154
But there are a few people
who find something they have to do.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.199
Something obsesses 'em.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.935
Something that if they can't do it,

47:52.370 --> 47:54.170
it's gonna drive them
clean out of their mind.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.581
I'm that guy.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.293
And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.004
His name...

48:05.591 --> 48:07.467
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.803
- (crowd cheering)
- MAN: Yeah! Whoo!

48:12.056 --> 48:15.767
And together, we're gonna build
the fastest automobiles in the world.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.019
(crowd cheering)

48:19.230 --> 48:21.773
And we're gonna make history,
too, at Le Mans.

48:21.857 --> 48:23.900
(crowd cheering and whooping)

48:24.860 --> 48:26.778
- Let's go.
- What?

48:27.655 --> 48:29.114
My name is Carroll Shelby.

48:30.032 --> 48:31.491
I build race cars.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.535
(cheering continues)

48:43.212 --> 48:44.421
(engine stops)

48:51.887 --> 48:53.096
(car door closes)

48:54.932 --> 48:56.641
KEN: No. Whatever it is, no.

48:58.978 --> 48:59.978
No.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.063
Thirty minutes.

49:02.481 --> 49:05.317
Ah, just... I'm spent.

49:05.401 --> 49:07.736
- I wanna have a bath.
- You're gonna wanna see this.

49:08.654 --> 49:09.738
Trust me.

49:11.032 --> 49:13.533
Thirty minutes. I'll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.079
Thirty minutes.

49:18.164 --> 49:19.414
- Yeah.
- (car engine starts)

49:20.833 --> 49:22.667
(tires screeching)

49:24.295 --> 49:26.087
(jazz music playing)

49:37.975 --> 49:39.351
Bloody hell.

49:45.441 --> 49:47.067
Fresh off the plane from England.

49:48.277 --> 49:52.906
Now, she's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

49:58.371 --> 50:00.205
(engine revving)

50:02.541 --> 50:03.917
Whoa! Come on.

50:12.677 --> 50:14.219
(tires screeching)

50:16.681 --> 50:18.056
Interesting.

50:35.074 --> 50:36.074
Well?

50:36.117 --> 50:37.450
It's awful.

50:37.535 --> 50:38.827
It's worse than awful.

50:38.911 --> 50:42.580
Yeah, it doesn't track.
You know, the third gear is too high.

50:43.666 --> 50:46.292
Torque is not reaching the road.

50:46.377 --> 50:50.296
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.674
And over 140, it thinks it's a...

50:52.758 --> 50:53.758
Airplane.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.093
Yeah.

50:55.177 --> 50:57.178
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

51:00.099 --> 51:01.182
Anything else?

51:06.647 --> 51:08.481
- (engine revving)
- One sec.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.421
(rock music playing on stereo)

51:38.888 --> 51:40.305
You were back late last night.

51:40.389 --> 51:41.431
Yeah.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.520
- Were you working?
- Mmm.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.400
So, you didn't go anyplace?

51:53.527 --> 51:54.778
What?

51:56.781 --> 51:58.823
Well, I'm asking, did you
go anyplace last night?

52:01.494 --> 52:02.702
Mollie.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.579
It's a simple question.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.541
And I answered, didn't I?

52:09.084 --> 52:10.293
What was the answer?

52:12.379 --> 52:13.379
Is something up, love?

52:14.757 --> 52:15.942
- (engine revs)
- (tires screech)

52:15.966 --> 52:17.360
What are you doing? What are you doing?

52:17.384 --> 52:19.093
You're driving very fast.

52:19.178 --> 52:20.345
Oh, am I? Am I?

52:20.429 --> 52:21.513
Yes, you are.

52:22.598 --> 52:24.015
(tires screeching)

52:24.099 --> 52:25.899
Bloody hell! What are you...
The hell is this?

52:26.477 --> 52:28.102
Well, you tell me, 'cause I don't know.

52:28.187 --> 52:32.106
Right, slow down!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Mollie!

52:32.191 --> 52:33.316
(tires screeching)

52:34.735 --> 52:37.070
Please slow it down, all right?

52:37.154 --> 52:38.905
You trying to kill us or something?

52:38.989 --> 52:40.884
- Well, I thought we love this shit.
- KEN: What?

52:40.908 --> 52:42.826
(horns honking)

52:42.910 --> 52:45.411
- Bloody hell!
- It's a bit of racing fun. No?

52:45.496 --> 52:46.932
No, no, no. It's not the same at all.

52:46.956 --> 52:48.832
(shouting) Well, I think it's thrilling!

52:49.500 --> 52:50.875
All right.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.544
Look, I saw you, all right?

52:54.129 --> 52:56.422
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.383
Okay. Shit. Okay, but slow it...

52:58.467 --> 53:00.927
And then all day you've got
that stupid look on your face.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.012
Mollie, slow down. You're too close here.

53:04.431 --> 53:05.890
(horn blaring)

53:05.975 --> 53:08.518
Mollie, put on the brakes right now...

53:08.602 --> 53:10.770
Not until you tell me what's going on!

53:10.855 --> 53:13.189
All right. I went to look at a car.

53:13.274 --> 53:15.149
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

53:15.234 --> 53:17.193
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

53:18.487 --> 53:20.287
There's a corner coming.
You'd better hold on.

53:21.824 --> 53:24.534
Oh! Are you gonna lift your
foot off at all through this?

53:24.618 --> 53:26.138
No, 'cause I like a clean racing line.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.203
Slow down!

53:27.663 --> 53:29.330
(tires screeching)

53:29.415 --> 53:31.165
(clattering)

53:31.250 --> 53:32.166
KEN: Okay.

53:32.251 --> 53:33.918
Shel offered me a job.

53:34.003 --> 53:37.463
Ford has a car that they want
to put up against a Ferrari.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.234
- You told me you were done.
- That's it. Now, slow...

53:39.258 --> 53:40.717
I didn't say yes.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.218
Slow down.

53:42.303 --> 53:43.720
You told me you quit.

53:44.930 --> 53:47.432
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old, you said.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.058
Fat and old.

53:49.143 --> 53:51.144
(brakes screech)

53:53.147 --> 53:54.624
- I don't understand.
- That's what you told me.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.316
I don't understand.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.528
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

54:02.114 --> 54:04.532
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.911
Don't make it a secret,

54:07.995 --> 54:09.412
what you want or what you feel,

54:09.496 --> 54:12.123
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy.

54:14.293 --> 54:16.294
Moll, I don't even know what I feel.

54:23.510 --> 54:24.969
If you do this...

54:27.848 --> 54:29.891
then he better be paying you this time.

54:32.353 --> 54:35.188
'Cause I can't work any more
hours and look after Peter.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.731
You know, the IRS have the garage.

54:36.815 --> 54:38.858
I'm not losing my home.

54:39.652 --> 54:41.277
It's $200 a day.

54:44.156 --> 54:45.657
Plus expenses.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.744
Are you shitting me?

54:50.245 --> 54:52.372
But I haven't decided.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.751
$200 a day?

54:59.505 --> 55:00.630
Are you nuts?

55:03.676 --> 55:05.677
(upbeat rock music playing)

55:08.305 --> 55:10.139
(engine roaring)

55:21.527 --> 55:23.111
(tires screech)

55:24.321 --> 55:27.240
Look at this. This is ridiculous. Here.

55:27.324 --> 55:30.410
So, Shel, grabbing air.

55:30.494 --> 55:31.869
That's the problem.

55:32.788 --> 55:36.416
Over 90, air's getting in,
not getting out.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.418
It's the nose, I can feel it in the wheel.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.855
ENGINEER: Mr. Miles, if there's a problem,
the computer will find it.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.088
- All right.
- PHIL: Charlie,

55:42.172 --> 55:44.340
get some Scotch tape and a ball of wool.

55:45.551 --> 55:47.802
All right. Good, good, good.

55:47.886 --> 55:51.681
So, now let's just, uh,
get all of this junk out.

55:51.765 --> 55:52.849
Right, Pops?

55:52.933 --> 55:55.435
PHIL: Yeah, yeah. I concur.
Come on, guys.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.263
ENGINEER: What are they doing?

55:59.773 --> 56:01.315
Making your car faster.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.360
(engine roaring)

56:08.991 --> 56:11.284
There. Right there.
Airflow's getting stuck.

56:14.580 --> 56:17.415
ENGINEER: I see it.
Yarn blows straight up.

56:17.499 --> 56:18.935
- PHIL: Yep.
- ENGINEER: The front's lifting.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.460
Damn, he's right.

56:29.511 --> 56:30.678
(Ken grunting)

56:31.346 --> 56:34.557
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

56:34.641 --> 56:36.726
PHIL: Any lighter, we're getting fragile.

56:36.810 --> 56:39.020
Took 70 pounds out of her
in the last week.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.898
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

56:41.982 --> 56:44.233
(exhales) So put in a bigger engine.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.777
Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

56:47.529 --> 56:48.654
(engine rumbling)

56:48.739 --> 56:50.615
(loudly) Managed to make it
52 pounds lighter

56:50.699 --> 56:52.366
than the NASCAR unit.

56:57.206 --> 56:59.499
All-new aluminum cylinder heads...

57:00.375 --> 57:03.336
vibration dampeners,
water pump, smaller valves.

57:03.796 --> 57:05.129
We call it the Beast.

57:05.923 --> 57:07.131
Yeah, I can see why,

57:07.216 --> 57:08.382
but how's it gonna fit

57:08.467 --> 57:10.468
without a redesign of the engine bed?

57:10.552 --> 57:11.780
Well, it certainly wasn't easy.

57:11.804 --> 57:13.114
Good morning, gentlemen. Mr. Shelby.

57:13.138 --> 57:17.016
So, you already put that in a GT40?

57:17.434 --> 57:19.393
(chuckles) I'm afraid we have.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.105
(engine rumbling)

57:25.192 --> 57:26.567
PHIL: I'll be damned.

57:27.319 --> 57:28.694
Well, it's heavy, of course.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.340
Problems with the handling,
especially the stopping.

57:30.364 --> 57:32.323
- I can show you the data.
- What problems?

57:32.407 --> 57:33.676
- Understeers a little, but...
- KEN: Can I, uh, borrow that?

57:33.700 --> 57:35.243
Can I borrow that?

57:35.327 --> 57:36.577
Just a second. Thank you.

57:36.662 --> 57:37.662
ROY: Ken!

57:38.580 --> 57:41.624
Ken, perhaps you want to check
with HQ before you test...

57:41.708 --> 57:43.209
What did he say?

57:43.293 --> 57:44.354
- We should ask...
- (engine revs)

57:44.378 --> 57:45.378
Right.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.758
- (engine revving)
- Oh, yes!

57:58.225 --> 58:00.643
Mr. Shelby, welcome to Dearborn.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.127
What are you doing at a test track?

58:02.187 --> 58:04.397
You're gonna get Castrol oil
all over that nice suit.

58:04.481 --> 58:07.108
Ah, I wanted to hear your thoughts
on a few planning decisions.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.693
You know, personnel for Le Mans.

58:08.777 --> 58:10.171
CARROLL: Well, it's a hell of a lineup.

58:10.195 --> 58:12.113
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

58:12.197 --> 58:13.990
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

58:14.074 --> 58:16.450
Hill's a lock. Amon, McLaren, too.

58:16.535 --> 58:18.244
We're less sure about Miles.

58:18.328 --> 58:19.704
We like Richie Ginther...

58:20.247 --> 58:22.665
Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.418
Well, you're gonna want
the best driver for the car.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.044
Understands the machine.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.546
That's Ken.

58:28.630 --> 58:30.464
Oh! Yes!

58:31.425 --> 58:34.802
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

58:34.887 --> 58:37.096
I may not get the finer points
of racing, Mr. Shelby,

58:37.181 --> 58:38.472
but I do know people.

58:39.057 --> 58:40.099
Miles is a...

58:40.684 --> 58:43.186
Well, he's a beatnik. He dresses like one.

58:44.104 --> 58:45.354
Ford means reliability.

58:46.064 --> 58:47.815
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.734
Whoa!

58:49.818 --> 58:51.569
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

58:55.032 --> 58:56.991
What's the lap record here, Burt?

58:57.075 --> 58:58.326
1:58.

58:59.328 --> 59:01.662
- 1:50 dead.
- CARROLL: A beatnik?

59:01.747 --> 59:04.457
That man landed a busted tank
on the beach at D-Day

59:04.541 --> 59:06.500
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.920
A beatnik?

59:09.004 --> 59:10.523
You know, Lee here asked me a while back,

59:10.547 --> 59:12.256
"What's the one thing money can't buy?"

59:13.217 --> 59:14.300
I'll tell you what it is.

59:14.927 --> 59:16.886
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

59:17.930 --> 59:19.263
That's Ken Miles.

59:21.016 --> 59:22.516
Well, be that as it may...

59:23.602 --> 59:25.311
we think he may be too pure.

59:33.445 --> 59:36.614
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.242
"Too pure"?

59:40.202 --> 59:41.702
What exactly does that mean?

59:42.537 --> 59:43.871
It means he's all about himself.

59:46.041 --> 59:47.917
ABC puts a microphone under his nose,

59:48.001 --> 59:50.211
perhaps there's a detail he dislikes,

59:50.295 --> 59:51.629
millions watching...

59:51.713 --> 59:53.798
do you trust him not to
put out the wrong message?

59:53.882 --> 59:56.550
Well, look, you can get a clean-cut,
all-American poster boy

59:56.635 --> 59:57.779
and stick him behind the wheel,

59:57.803 --> 59:59.136
teach him what to say.

59:59.221 --> 1:00:02.061
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car,
if all you want to do is lose.

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:05.518
So, you don't agree with us on this issue?

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:09.981
I'm saying you gotta trust me on this one.

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:13.442
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:18.656
Put a Ford-type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:20.950
That's the Ford way.

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:29.959
ANNOUNCER (on radio):
Yet another championship win for Ferrari

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.711
as British driver John Surtees

1:00:31.795 --> 1:00:33.421
pilots his Ferrari 312...

1:00:33.505 --> 1:00:34.714
Ferrari wins.

1:00:35.382 --> 1:00:37.883
ANNOUNCER: It's Surtees'
first win since the '64...

1:00:37.968 --> 1:00:39.760
PHIL: Wedges. We have wedges.

1:00:39.845 --> 1:00:41.846
KEN: Oh, good, good, good.

1:00:41.930 --> 1:00:43.055
Perfect.

1:00:44.099 --> 1:00:45.808
- 40?
- Yep.

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:49.645
(brakes squeal)

1:00:55.110 --> 1:00:56.652
- DAN: Hey, boss.
- Hey, Dan.

1:00:56.737 --> 1:00:58.946
- Boss, Ferrari just bagged...
- You got a passport?

1:00:59.031 --> 1:01:00.031
CHARLIE: What's that?

1:01:00.115 --> 1:01:01.866
Sign that. Get a passport.

1:01:01.950 --> 1:01:03.701
Get it back to me by Friday. Frosty.

1:01:03.785 --> 1:01:04.827
Boys, I'm going to France.

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:08.497
Phil.

1:01:08.582 --> 1:01:10.041
Ken, can I get a word?

1:01:16.590 --> 1:01:17.631
KEN: Oh.

1:01:19.051 --> 1:01:20.426
Can I take this?

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.594
Hey.

1:01:22.095 --> 1:01:25.222
Do you know why Ford named it the GT40?

1:01:25.307 --> 1:01:27.224
Why they put that "40" on there?

1:01:27.309 --> 1:01:29.268
- No.
- Regulations. All right?

1:01:29.353 --> 1:01:31.854
We gotta be 40 inches high

1:01:31.938 --> 1:01:34.648
to make the ground clearance requirements.

1:01:34.733 --> 1:01:35.733
No more, no less.

1:01:35.817 --> 1:01:37.485
They measure it before every race.

1:01:37.569 --> 1:01:40.529
Problem is, that with that height,

1:01:40.614 --> 1:01:43.491
there's too much drag
under the car, all right?

1:01:43.575 --> 1:01:45.368
So, we have a solution.

1:01:45.452 --> 1:01:47.132
Wedges. We put wedges in the suspension...

1:01:47.204 --> 1:01:48.746
You're not coming next week.

1:01:51.666 --> 1:01:52.875
You're not coming, Ken.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.006
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

1:02:00.300 --> 1:02:01.592
and Bob Bondurant.

1:02:02.386 --> 1:02:03.886
It's Ford's call.

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:07.848
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

1:02:07.933 --> 1:02:10.017
so you cannot drive their race car.

1:02:11.686 --> 1:02:13.373
And putting aside the fact
that you made that car

1:02:13.397 --> 1:02:14.563
whatever the hell it is...

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:18.192
and you're the best man
I got behind the wheel...

1:02:38.171 --> 1:02:40.089
I'm gonna reroute the oil line.

1:02:40.173 --> 1:02:43.759
If there's spillage, it could drip
onto the rear nearside disc.

1:02:43.844 --> 1:02:45.010
Ken...

1:02:45.095 --> 1:02:50.433
Tell the boys
to watch their pace come sunrise.

1:02:50.517 --> 1:02:53.853
The, uh, the gearbox will overheat.

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:58.232
(door closes)

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:09.452
(janitor humming)

1:03:11.955 --> 1:03:13.205
Ken, the race is starting soon.

1:03:13.290 --> 1:03:14.707
Want it on the radio?

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:16.167
Not unless you do.

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:19.044
(continues humming)

1:03:32.392 --> 1:03:34.310
(changing radio stations)

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:36.687
COMMENTATOR 1: of the race.

1:03:36.771 --> 1:03:37.855
There they are.

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:39.125
The Maserati going into the Esses,

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:41.442
but it's still the number 2 car,
driven by Chris Amon.

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:43.402
In third place, is the number 1 Ford

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:45.070
that is driven by Bruce McLaren.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:47.156
A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.

1:03:47.699 --> 1:03:51.660
3:43.4 lap for car number 2, a Ford.

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:53.347
COMMENTATOR 2: I think
it's a little bit quick

1:03:53.371 --> 1:03:54.580
for this stage of the game.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:55.725
COMMENTATOR 1:
Little bit quick right now.

1:03:55.749 --> 1:03:56.916
Racing too hot.

1:03:58.543 --> 1:04:01.272
COMMENTATOR 1: This could go down
to the last hour or so, don't you think?

1:04:01.296 --> 1:04:02.398
COMMENTATOR 2: It could,
but the probabilities

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:05.299
for a finish like that
in a 24-hour race are awfully small.

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:07.612
COMMENTATOR 1: Another Ford
has come into the pits.

1:04:07.636 --> 1:04:09.929
It's being pushed into
the pits by the mechanics.

1:04:10.013 --> 1:04:11.305
Head gasket.

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.891
The car's not a moon rocket.

1:04:14.267 --> 1:04:15.661
COMMENTATOR 2: Trailing
Bob Bondurant in fourth,

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.019
car number 7.

1:04:17.103 --> 1:04:20.189
Leading number 20, Ferrari.
Michael Parkes.

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.418
So, we have Ford running one,
two, three. How about that?

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:24.276
Too soon. Surely too soon.

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:28.870
COMMENTATOR 1: One has
to really be respectful

1:04:28.907 --> 1:04:30.324
of the mechanism with any...

1:04:30.408 --> 1:04:32.034
(commentary continues indistinctly)

1:04:36.331 --> 1:04:38.290
(engines revving over radio)

1:04:42.462 --> 1:04:43.940
COMMENTATOR 1: Here's the big story,

1:04:43.964 --> 1:04:46.423
the lead Ford, driven
by Richie Ginther, retired

1:04:46.508 --> 1:04:48.592
with gearbox trouble,
and the new leader...

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:52.429
Gearbox. I told them. Be gentle with it.

1:04:52.514 --> 1:04:54.116
COMMENTATOR 1: and his
partner Lorenzo Bandini...

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:55.326
- (door opens)
- who was one of

1:04:55.350 --> 1:04:57.059
the two winning drivers last year.

1:04:58.645 --> 1:05:00.062
Who's there?

1:05:01.690 --> 1:05:05.568
COMMENTATOR 1: Again, we're back,
speaking to you live from Le Mans, France.

1:05:05.652 --> 1:05:08.195
The 24 Hours of Le Mans,
the Grand Prix of Endurance,

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:09.738
the 33rd renewal.

1:05:10.865 --> 1:05:12.408
What's that you're listening to?

1:05:13.201 --> 1:05:15.536
Oh, some race over in France.

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:17.454
(commentary continues indistinctly)

1:05:18.623 --> 1:05:19.665
Exciting?

1:05:20.458 --> 1:05:22.626
I'm not really paying much attention.

1:05:22.711 --> 1:05:25.212
COMMENTATOR 1: However, Phil,
there was one time in 1933,

1:05:25.297 --> 1:05:28.257
when the lead changed hands three times.

between Ford and Ferrari...

1:07:02.268 --> 1:07:03.268
Grace.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:07.189
(chatter continues)

1:07:09.109 --> 1:07:10.317
(intercom buzzing)

1:07:11.486 --> 1:07:14.613
Yes, sir. I will send him right in.

1:07:15.657 --> 1:07:16.824
Thank you.

1:07:19.327 --> 1:07:21.620
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

1:07:22.539 --> 1:07:24.139
- All right.
- LEO: Are you still willing

1:07:24.207 --> 1:07:26.166
to stake your reputation on this guy?

1:07:28.253 --> 1:07:29.628
SECRETARY: This way, Mr. Shelby.

1:07:39.806 --> 1:07:40.973
CARROLL: Mr. Ford.

1:07:41.641 --> 1:07:42.891
Gentlemen.

1:07:42.976 --> 1:07:44.268
FORD: Shelby.

1:07:57.031 --> 1:07:59.950
Give me one reason
why I don't fire everyone

1:08:00.034 --> 1:08:03.162
associated with this abomination
starting with you.

1:08:09.878 --> 1:08:11.003
Well, sir...

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:13.964
I was thinking about that very question

1:08:14.048 --> 1:08:16.925
as I sat out there
in your lovely waiting room.

1:08:18.845 --> 1:08:20.137
As I was sitting there...

1:08:20.847 --> 1:08:23.307
I watched that little
red folder right there...

1:08:24.309 --> 1:08:25.976
go through four pairs of hands...

1:08:27.437 --> 1:08:28.645
before it got to you.

1:08:29.564 --> 1:08:30.804
'Course that doesn't include...

1:08:31.816 --> 1:08:33.984
the 22 or so other Ford employees

1:08:34.068 --> 1:08:35.546
who probably poked at it before it made

1:08:35.570 --> 1:08:37.154
its way up to the 19th floor.

1:08:39.032 --> 1:08:40.449
All due respect, sir,

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:43.410
you can't win a race by committee.

1:08:44.996 --> 1:08:46.663
You need one man in charge.

1:08:47.582 --> 1:08:49.750
Now, the good news, as I see it,

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:51.919
is that even with all the extra weight...

1:08:54.297 --> 1:08:57.674
we still managed to put old Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

1:08:59.093 --> 1:09:00.177
Did we?

1:09:00.762 --> 1:09:01.845
Oh, yes.

1:09:03.723 --> 1:09:04.973
Expand.

1:09:06.392 --> 1:09:07.434
CARROLL: Well...

1:09:09.229 --> 1:09:10.395
sure, we hadn't...

1:09:11.397 --> 1:09:13.440
We haven't worked out how to corner yet.

1:09:14.526 --> 1:09:15.526
Or stay cool.

1:09:16.486 --> 1:09:18.654
Or stay on the ground.

1:09:19.447 --> 1:09:20.781
And a lot of stuff broke.

1:09:21.741 --> 1:09:24.326
In fact, the only thing that
didn't break was the brakes.

1:09:25.078 --> 1:09:26.912
Hell, right now, we don't even know

1:09:26.996 --> 1:09:29.540
if our paint job will last
the whole 24 hours.

1:09:35.672 --> 1:09:36.922
But our last lap...

1:09:37.632 --> 1:09:41.260
we clocked 218 miles an hour
down the Mulsanne Straight.

1:09:41.928 --> 1:09:45.180
Now, in all his years of racing...

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:49.476
old Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

1:09:50.812 --> 1:09:51.937
And now he knows...

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:53.897
without a doubt...

1:09:55.692 --> 1:09:57.442
we're faster than he is...

1:10:00.947 --> 1:10:02.698
even with the wrong driver...

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:05.284
and all the committees.

1:10:07.245 --> 1:10:11.081
And that's what he's thinking about
while he's sitting in Modena, Italy...

1:10:12.083 --> 1:10:13.500
right now.

1:10:15.086 --> 1:10:16.670
That man is scared to death...

1:10:18.131 --> 1:10:20.799
that this year you actually
might be smart enough

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:22.175
to start trusting me.

1:10:25.430 --> 1:10:26.638
So, yeah...

1:10:28.641 --> 1:10:31.226
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

1:10:35.148 --> 1:10:36.273
You're welcome.

1:10:54.167 --> 1:10:55.459
Come here.

1:11:03.217 --> 1:11:04.927
See that little building down there?

1:11:05.762 --> 1:11:06.929
In World War ll...

1:11:07.597 --> 1:11:11.475
three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

1:11:13.978 --> 1:11:15.812
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?

1:11:17.649 --> 1:11:18.649
Think again.

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:21.944
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

1:11:24.530 --> 1:11:26.907
We know how to do more than push paper.

1:11:29.535 --> 1:11:31.828
And there is one man running this company.

1:11:34.415 --> 1:11:35.666
You report to him.

1:11:37.210 --> 1:11:38.460
You understand me?

1:11:39.128 --> 1:11:40.337
Yes, sir.

1:11:41.506 --> 1:11:43.882
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

1:11:47.011 --> 1:11:48.053
Thank you, sir.

1:11:59.816 --> 1:12:01.733
(TV playing indistinctly)

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:22.004
CARROLL: You were right.

1:12:22.755 --> 1:12:23.922
It's the gearbox.

1:12:24.799 --> 1:12:25.924
We ran too hot.

1:12:27.301 --> 1:12:28.541
Three out of four of 'em broke.

1:12:29.512 --> 1:12:30.846
The rod blew on the other one.

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.602
We're going back, Ken.

1:12:41.524 --> 1:12:44.693
They told me I had
"carte Blanche" this time.

1:12:46.487 --> 1:12:48.739
I looked it up.
It's French for "horseshit."

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:51.575
I know they're gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

1:12:51.659 --> 1:12:52.868
soon as they work out how.

1:12:53.578 --> 1:12:54.828
Well, the, uh...

1:12:55.955 --> 1:12:57.122
ice cream's melting.

1:13:00.209 --> 1:13:01.626
All right. Hey, Ken.

1:13:03.337 --> 1:13:04.796
You want me to apologize?

1:13:06.466 --> 1:13:07.507
Mmm.

1:13:08.051 --> 1:13:09.051
You want me to beg?

1:13:09.677 --> 1:13:11.386
I don't know. Let's try it out.

1:13:11.471 --> 1:13:13.638
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

1:13:19.979 --> 1:13:21.104
Ken, I'm sorry.

1:13:22.523 --> 1:13:23.774
Sincerely.

1:13:25.485 --> 1:13:26.610
Mmm.

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:30.363
Do you have any idea the kind
of shit that I had to eat

1:13:30.448 --> 1:13:31.948
just to get four wheels on that grid?

1:13:32.033 --> 1:13:33.325
No, you don't.

1:13:33.409 --> 1:13:35.095
'Cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

1:13:35.119 --> 1:13:38.413
Now knock it off, Ken. We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

1:13:38.498 --> 1:13:39.498
(grunts)

1:13:40.374 --> 1:13:41.374
(groans)

1:13:41.459 --> 1:13:42.542
(sighs)

1:13:43.044 --> 1:13:44.127
(Carroll chuckles)

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.046
(inhales sharply)

1:13:47.632 --> 1:13:50.425
Okay. All right. (chuckles)

1:13:51.219 --> 1:13:52.594
(grunts)

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:57.224
(both grunting)

1:13:59.393 --> 1:14:01.770
- God.
- (Carroll grunting)

1:14:02.438 --> 1:14:03.480
Come here.

1:14:04.732 --> 1:14:06.775
- Bloody car salesman.
- CARROLL: Shit!

1:14:07.735 --> 1:14:09.903
(both continue grunting)

1:14:09.987 --> 1:14:11.667
CARROLL: Come on. Now you're gonna get it.

1:14:16.244 --> 1:14:17.410
Get off me!

1:14:17.495 --> 1:14:18.954
(grunting continues)

1:14:19.956 --> 1:14:23.375
- Stubborn son of a bitch.
- (Ken screaming)

1:14:23.459 --> 1:14:24.668
KEN: God!

1:14:26.003 --> 1:14:27.087
(panting)

1:14:27.171 --> 1:14:28.421
- You just look...
- KEN: Right.

1:14:29.507 --> 1:14:30.924
- Yeah, now.
- KEN: You...

1:14:31.008 --> 1:14:32.509
- Ow!
- KEN: You all right?

1:14:32.593 --> 1:14:33.844
CARROLL: Shit!

1:14:35.471 --> 1:14:36.888
Now you're gonna get it.

1:14:38.683 --> 1:14:40.517
- Come here.
- (Ken groaning)

1:14:40.601 --> 1:14:41.852
(both grunt)

1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:44.104
CARROLL: Done.

1:14:44.188 --> 1:14:45.814
(both panting)

1:14:49.277 --> 1:14:50.360
KEN: Mollie, darling.

1:14:51.154 --> 1:14:52.195
Yes, love?

1:14:52.697 --> 1:14:54.114
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

1:14:55.533 --> 1:14:56.575
Yes, love.

1:14:58.411 --> 1:14:59.744
You want one, too, Shelby?

1:15:00.246 --> 1:15:02.164
- No. No.
- Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

1:15:02.248 --> 1:15:04.040
No. He can get his own.

1:15:04.542 --> 1:15:05.792
Just for me, please.

1:15:06.878 --> 1:15:08.712
(panting)

1:15:12.758 --> 1:15:13.925
How long has that been?

1:15:15.136 --> 1:15:17.016
Oh, it's gotta be three
or four years, at least.

1:15:17.096 --> 1:15:19.347
Right. Riverside.

1:15:19.432 --> 1:15:22.100
Yeah. SCCA Divisional Championship.

1:15:22.727 --> 1:15:23.894
You broke my finger.

1:15:24.562 --> 1:15:25.896
(stammers)

1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:29.816
What's that nippy bloody thing

1:15:30.276 --> 1:15:31.735
you do under the arm, that thing?

1:15:31.819 --> 1:15:33.486
Yeah. I call that the Llama Bite.

1:15:33.571 --> 1:15:36.198
You name it? (laughs)

1:15:36.282 --> 1:15:38.658
Where'd you learn that? The Girl Scouts?

1:15:38.743 --> 1:15:40.827
- What? You wanna go again?
- MOLLIE: Here you go.

1:15:42.205 --> 1:15:43.330
KEN: You're an angel.

1:15:43.414 --> 1:15:44.497
CARROLL: Thank you.

1:15:44.582 --> 1:15:45.707
My pleasure.

1:15:46.751 --> 1:15:49.211
Right. Well, I'm about to go
to the grocery store.

1:15:49.295 --> 1:15:50.837
Anything you think you'll need?

1:15:51.589 --> 1:15:53.506
Um, ice cream.

1:15:54.634 --> 1:15:56.343
Ice cream would be good and, uh...

1:15:57.220 --> 1:15:58.261
bread.

1:15:59.555 --> 1:16:00.722
Right.

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:02.307
CARROLL: No, I'm good. Thank you.

1:16:03.226 --> 1:16:05.352
KEN: Thanks, Moll. (exhales deeply)

1:16:05.436 --> 1:16:06.937
You still take those for your ticker?

1:16:07.521 --> 1:16:09.522
Only 'cause they're so delicious.

1:16:09.607 --> 1:16:12.484
- KEN: (sighs) Up yours.
- Oh, go to hell.

1:16:13.778 --> 1:16:17.030
(upbeat rock music playing)

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.577
Come on. Giddy-up.
Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up!

1:16:22.662 --> 1:16:24.162
(machine whirring)

1:16:38.552 --> 1:16:41.096
Phil! Here's the one for you, mate.

1:16:41.180 --> 1:16:42.472
Dino, come here.

1:16:46.727 --> 1:16:49.938
- (engine revs)
- (tires screech)

1:17:00.866 --> 1:17:03.702
- Well?
- There's still lag when I hit the gas.

1:17:03.786 --> 1:17:05.347
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

1:17:05.371 --> 1:17:06.746
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

1:17:06.831 --> 1:17:08.623
We're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:10.166
KEN: (sighs) Three weeks to Daytona,

1:17:10.251 --> 1:17:13.128
and it still feels
like a bag of squirrels.

1:17:13.212 --> 1:17:14.254
CARROLL: Brake heat.

1:17:14.839 --> 1:17:16.673
That's a whole different ball game.

1:17:16.757 --> 1:17:18.967
KEN: All right, Petey,
let's go for that ride.

1:17:27.810 --> 1:17:28.935
What are you doing?

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:32.105
You see that crack?

1:17:32.189 --> 1:17:33.732
That's my marker for turn eight.

1:17:36.861 --> 1:17:38.153
What, to slow down?

1:17:39.238 --> 1:17:42.198
Uh, brush the brakes and downshift.

1:17:44.368 --> 1:17:46.619
But you'll be going 150 miles an hour.

1:17:47.580 --> 1:17:48.788
Yeah.

1:17:48.873 --> 1:17:50.582
PETER: So how do you see it?

1:17:50.666 --> 1:17:53.418
You're going fast,
but as the car speeds up...

1:17:54.128 --> 1:17:56.379
everything else slows down.

1:17:56.464 --> 1:17:58.006
You don't do that.

1:17:59.050 --> 1:18:00.967
You do this. Right?

1:18:01.052 --> 1:18:02.761
And then you see everything.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:07.390
Do you set other markers?

1:18:07.475 --> 1:18:09.601
Indeed I do.

1:18:11.270 --> 1:18:12.437
Lots of them.

1:18:14.565 --> 1:18:18.860
Yeah, 'cause you can't just push
the car hard the whole way, right?

1:18:18.944 --> 1:18:21.654
That's right. You have
to be kind to the car.

1:18:21.739 --> 1:18:25.909
You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you.

1:18:26.911 --> 1:18:30.789
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

1:18:30.873 --> 1:18:32.624
and expect it to hold together,

1:18:32.708 --> 1:18:36.878
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1:18:39.799 --> 1:18:40.799
Look out there.

1:18:41.967 --> 1:18:44.886
Out there is the perfect lap.

1:18:47.223 --> 1:18:48.390
No mistakes.

1:18:49.225 --> 1:18:51.393
Every gear change, every corner...

1:18:53.145 --> 1:18:54.187
perfect.

1:18:55.856 --> 1:18:57.023
You see it?

1:19:01.237 --> 1:19:02.404
I think so.

1:19:04.448 --> 1:19:05.865
Most people can't.

1:19:07.326 --> 1:19:09.994
Most people don't even know
it's out there, but it is.

1:19:12.373 --> 1:19:13.540
It's there.

1:19:16.627 --> 1:19:17.919
You want some ice cream?

1:19:20.631 --> 1:19:21.881
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:19:22.967 --> 1:19:24.008
Come on, then.

1:19:24.718 --> 1:19:26.219
Do you know what this marker is?

1:19:26.303 --> 1:19:27.447
- PETER: What?
- KEN: That one.

1:19:27.471 --> 1:19:28.847
Pull my finger. You'll find out.

1:19:28.931 --> 1:19:30.473
- (Ken blows raspberry)
- (chuckles)

1:19:41.068 --> 1:19:43.236
(tires screech)

1:19:45.823 --> 1:19:47.031
(engine roaring)

1:19:47.116 --> 1:19:48.533
(tires screeching)

1:19:51.036 --> 1:19:53.121
How much longer before he comes in?

1:19:53.205 --> 1:19:55.665
Uh, well, we change drivers
every four hours,

1:19:55.749 --> 1:19:57.519
- so about 10 minutes.
- CARROLL: No, hang on.

1:19:57.543 --> 1:20:00.086
You're saying Beebe
is 100 percent in charge now?

1:20:00.171 --> 1:20:02.046
LEE: Yes, and he wants Miles gone.

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:04.757
Look, it is personal with this guy.

1:20:04.842 --> 1:20:06.843
And, yes, he has the leverage
to stick it to you.

1:20:06.927 --> 1:20:08.607
He and the Deuce
are flying there tomorrow.

1:20:08.679 --> 1:20:09.823
He's gonna tell you in person.

1:20:09.847 --> 1:20:11.097
Now, all he is hoping for

1:20:11.182 --> 1:20:12.724
- is that you lose your cool.
- Uh-huh.

1:20:12.808 --> 1:20:14.434
It's time to let this go.

1:20:14.518 --> 1:20:15.871
You cannot destroy the whole thing.

1:20:15.895 --> 1:20:16.978
Not for one goddamn guy.

1:20:17.062 --> 1:20:19.022
- Sure, I can.
- Well, why?

1:20:19.106 --> 1:20:21.626
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

1:20:21.692 --> 1:20:24.027
(engine roaring)

1:20:24.111 --> 1:20:25.695
(tires screeching)

1:20:29.241 --> 1:20:31.284
- (brakes squeaking)
- Oh, shit!

1:20:31.368 --> 1:20:32.702
(tires squealing)

1:20:32.786 --> 1:20:34.245
He's got brake fade.

1:20:39.043 --> 1:20:41.127
(tires squealing)

1:20:41.754 --> 1:20:42.754
CHARLIE: Ease off!

1:20:50.179 --> 1:20:51.679
(gasps softly)

1:20:53.182 --> 1:20:54.182
LEE: Carroll?

1:20:54.517 --> 1:20:55.660
- PHIL: Get him out!
- MOLLIE: Peter!

1:20:55.684 --> 1:20:57.477
Go on. Go inside.

1:20:57.561 --> 1:20:58.603
Just stay there.

1:20:58.687 --> 1:21:00.063
- MAN: Get Ken!
- MOLLIE: Ken!

1:21:00.147 --> 1:21:01.356
MAN: Get him out!

1:21:03.275 --> 1:21:04.275
There he is!

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:05.360
CHARLIE: Ken!

1:21:05.402 --> 1:21:06.569
MAN: I can see him.

1:21:09.073 --> 1:21:10.490
(Ken coughing)

1:21:13.077 --> 1:21:14.285
- Ken!
- MAN: Come on.

1:21:15.663 --> 1:21:17.080
(Ken gasping, coughing)

1:21:21.085 --> 1:21:22.168
KEN: The brakes.

1:21:23.963 --> 1:21:25.630
(coughing)

1:21:31.845 --> 1:21:34.764
Let's just rip out
the damn engine. All right?

1:21:34.848 --> 1:21:37.517
We can't use it if we can't stop.

1:21:37.601 --> 1:21:39.120
CHARLIE: You know,
the brakes would last longer

1:21:39.144 --> 1:21:40.645
if we slowed down a bit.

1:21:41.021 --> 1:21:43.314
Wouldn't that defeat the whole
purpose of the extra power?

1:21:44.191 --> 1:21:46.671
You know, I thought the whole point
was to win the damned race.

1:21:47.570 --> 1:21:49.654
PHIL: Maybe we could design
a new assembly.

1:21:49.738 --> 1:21:53.324
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits...

1:21:53.867 --> 1:21:56.452
swap out the entire braking system.

1:21:56.537 --> 1:21:57.912
Rotors included.

1:21:58.664 --> 1:21:59.872
Put in a fresh one.

1:21:59.957 --> 1:22:02.959
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,
are we allowed to do that?

1:22:03.043 --> 1:22:06.004
I don't know. I don't read French.

1:22:07.965 --> 1:22:12.677
Well, brakes are "a part"
like any other, right?

1:22:12.761 --> 1:22:15.221
We are allowed to change parts.

1:22:15.306 --> 1:22:17.181
CHARLIE: Yes.
Will we have time to do that?

1:22:17.266 --> 1:22:18.725
PHIL: I don't know yet, Charlie.

1:22:19.518 --> 1:22:22.312
- I'm gonna take him home.
- All right.

1:22:22.396 --> 1:22:24.606
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

1:22:34.199 --> 1:22:36.409
Have you ever been on fire?

1:22:38.871 --> 1:22:42.290
Uh, well, no, it's never happened to me.

1:22:44.543 --> 1:22:45.752
(stammers)

1:22:47.421 --> 1:22:49.797
The suit's flameproof, see?

1:22:49.882 --> 1:22:51.299
It, uh, keeps heat out.

1:22:52.301 --> 1:22:53.301
Yeah.

1:22:55.095 --> 1:22:58.723
But Lewis-Evans burned to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1:22:58.849 --> 1:23:00.808
He had a flameproof suit on.

1:23:02.144 --> 1:23:04.896
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, um...

1:23:07.941 --> 1:23:09.359
See, he got stuck.

1:23:09.443 --> 1:23:10.735
He couldn't breathe.

1:23:12.112 --> 1:23:15.323
So, as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1:23:19.578 --> 1:23:21.037
Dad got out.

1:23:22.456 --> 1:23:23.956
- He sure did.
- MOLLIE: Peter!

1:23:28.045 --> 1:23:29.128
(whispers) Bye.

1:23:30.214 --> 1:23:31.339
PHIL: See ya.

1:23:34.134 --> 1:23:35.593
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1:23:36.887 --> 1:23:38.012
What's wrong with you?

1:23:39.139 --> 1:23:42.892
And don't be telling me brakes
or me almost kicking the bucket out there.

1:23:42.976 --> 1:23:45.103
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1:23:47.648 --> 1:23:49.148
It's under control.

1:23:49.233 --> 1:23:50.608
What is it?

1:23:50.693 --> 1:23:52.295
You know how we talked about
how you do your thing,

1:23:52.319 --> 1:23:53.444
I do my thing?

1:23:53.529 --> 1:23:54.881
- This is my thing.
- Really, Shel...

1:23:54.905 --> 1:23:56.197
Just trust me, Ken.

1:23:57.074 --> 1:23:58.241
(sighing) You got a plan?

1:23:59.159 --> 1:24:00.243
Absolutely.

1:24:00.911 --> 1:24:01.911
It a good one?

1:24:02.913 --> 1:24:04.288
It's high risk.

1:24:04.373 --> 1:24:05.456
How high risk?

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:06.874
Extremely high risk.

1:24:08.836 --> 1:24:10.086
Well, that's something.

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:12.880
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1:24:25.227 --> 1:24:27.520
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1:24:28.564 --> 1:24:30.940
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

1:24:31.024 --> 1:24:34.318
but when a man pays $9 million
for an automobile,

1:24:34.403 --> 1:24:36.237
he ought to at least be able to see it.

1:24:36.321 --> 1:24:37.822
Well, that sounds reasonable enough.

1:24:37.906 --> 1:24:39.741
Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?

1:24:39.825 --> 1:24:41.075
CARROLL: Sure.

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.952
- In private?
- Uh, yeah.

1:24:43.036 --> 1:24:44.579
That would be preferable.

1:24:44.663 --> 1:24:45.872
CARROLL: All right. Hey, Phil.

1:24:45.956 --> 1:24:47.540
You wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?

1:24:47.624 --> 1:24:49.250
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1:24:49.334 --> 1:24:50.376
Of course.

1:24:50.461 --> 1:24:51.563
CARROLL: Come up to my office, Leo.

1:24:51.587 --> 1:24:52.814
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Phil.

1:24:52.838 --> 1:24:54.797
Give you a little tour of your car.

1:24:55.841 --> 1:24:58.676
We, uh, took out your 289 small block...

1:24:59.428 --> 1:25:01.721
and put in a 4277-liter.

1:25:04.558 --> 1:25:06.976
Uh, firstly, I want to just clear the air.

1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:09.312
I hope that whatever disagreements

1:25:09.396 --> 1:25:11.230
between us can just be chalked up...

1:25:11.982 --> 1:25:14.609
to natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1:25:14.693 --> 1:25:17.320
Oh, I appreciate that, Leo. Truly, I do.

1:25:19.072 --> 1:25:23.618
It falls on me, Shelby, to inform you
that I have been appointed

1:25:23.702 --> 1:25:26.454
overall executive director
of the racing program.

1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:31.542
Now, I do hope that this
won't be a problem between us.

1:25:32.586 --> 1:25:34.629
Well, I assure you, Leo, it will not.

1:25:41.845 --> 1:25:43.054
(rattling)

1:25:45.015 --> 1:25:46.098
Hey, Carroll...

1:25:46.725 --> 1:25:47.725
Carroll!

1:25:47.810 --> 1:25:50.228
And what is that top speed
with the, uh, 427?

1:25:50.312 --> 1:25:52.146
Well, why don't we take it for a spin?

1:25:52.231 --> 1:25:53.731
- What?
- Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

1:25:53.816 --> 1:25:56.192
- Hop on in. Go on.
- You want me to...

1:25:56.276 --> 1:25:58.319
CARROLL: Just see
what $9 million feels like.

1:25:58.403 --> 1:26:00.738
- (banging door)
- Hey!

1:26:00.823 --> 1:26:02.114
God...

1:26:02.199 --> 1:26:03.991
(inaudible conversation)

1:26:05.702 --> 1:26:06.786
Open the door!

1:26:06.870 --> 1:26:08.412
Hey, open the door!

1:26:09.081 --> 1:26:10.790
- Open the door!
- (engine starts)

1:26:11.875 --> 1:26:13.000
(revs engine)

1:26:13.085 --> 1:26:15.878
Just hold me right there,
and you take my hand.

1:26:17.714 --> 1:26:20.591
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

1:26:20.676 --> 1:26:23.036
We're gonna build the next one
for comfort. Don't you worry.

1:26:24.346 --> 1:26:25.555
(glass shatters)

1:26:31.353 --> 1:26:32.812
- (latch clicks)
- Open the door.

1:26:32.896 --> 1:26:34.290
Sorry, sir, if you just give me a moment.

1:26:34.314 --> 1:26:35.458
- Open the door.
- It's a sticky one.

1:26:35.482 --> 1:26:37.233
- (engine revs)
- You ready?

1:26:37.317 --> 1:26:39.003
The name on the middle
of that steering wheel

1:26:39.027 --> 1:26:41.362
should tell you that I was
born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

1:26:41.446 --> 1:26:43.573
- Attaboy.
- (engine revs)

1:26:43.657 --> 1:26:45.616
(tires screeching)

1:26:45.701 --> 1:26:48.494
Whoa! It's got a little kick, doesn't it?

1:26:48.912 --> 1:26:50.830
- Open this door.
- Oh, there we go.

1:26:50.914 --> 1:26:52.957
Good God, Mr. Beebe. You okay, sir?

1:26:55.043 --> 1:26:57.253
- Whoa! Oh, my God!
- (engine roaring)

1:26:58.505 --> 1:27:01.090
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- (tires screeching)

1:27:02.301 --> 1:27:03.926
(tires screeching)

1:27:04.887 --> 1:27:06.387
Yeah, baby.

1:27:06.471 --> 1:27:09.015
- Yeah, baby.
- (tires screeching)

1:27:12.185 --> 1:27:16.564
It's about right now the uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

1:27:16.648 --> 1:27:18.733
(Ford screaming)

1:27:23.530 --> 1:27:26.240
FORD: Oh, my God! Whoa!

1:27:26.325 --> 1:27:28.534
(tires screeching)

1:27:28.619 --> 1:27:31.329
(screaming)

1:27:35.626 --> 1:27:38.044
(gasping)

1:27:38.921 --> 1:27:41.255
(sobbing)

1:27:50.265 --> 1:27:52.725
(continues sobbing)

1:28:02.736 --> 1:28:03.861
Mr. Ford...

1:28:07.824 --> 1:28:09.283
You okay?

1:28:09.368 --> 1:28:10.952
(breathing heavily)

1:28:12.663 --> 1:28:13.704
Mr. Ford...

1:28:14.456 --> 1:28:15.581
you all right?

1:28:15.666 --> 1:28:20.920
I had no idea.

1:28:23.924 --> 1:28:25.299
I wish my daddy...

1:28:25.801 --> 1:28:27.385
he were alive to see this.

1:28:27.761 --> 1:28:30.304
(sobbing) To feel this.

1:28:32.224 --> 1:28:34.184
Now, this is not a machine
just anybody can get in

1:28:34.226 --> 1:28:35.434
and easily control.

1:28:35.519 --> 1:28:36.769
Absolutely not.

1:28:37.604 --> 1:28:38.688
I had no idea.

1:28:38.772 --> 1:28:40.022
Now, you wanna win Le Mans.

1:28:40.983 --> 1:28:43.901
If you really wanna take first place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1:28:53.161 --> 1:28:54.495
Good timing.

1:28:54.579 --> 1:28:55.723
CARROLL: Now, he knows this car

1:28:55.747 --> 1:28:57.206
because he helped me build it.

1:28:58.750 --> 1:29:03.087
Shelby, you know I've already
appointed Leo Beebe director of racing.

1:29:03.171 --> 1:29:05.006
Which is exactly why I'm talking to you.

1:29:06.174 --> 1:29:08.759
Now, you let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1:29:09.553 --> 1:29:10.845
If he wins...

1:29:11.888 --> 1:29:13.472
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1:29:16.143 --> 1:29:17.351
And if he doesn't?

1:29:18.353 --> 1:29:21.939
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

1:29:22.024 --> 1:29:23.482
Lock, stock, and brand.

1:29:23.567 --> 1:29:24.608
Forever.

1:29:27.988 --> 1:29:30.740
COMMENTATOR (on PA): We're in
hour six at the Daytona 24,

1:29:30.824 --> 1:29:33.409
and Fords are dominating the leaderboard.

1:29:34.161 --> 1:29:37.246
Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead

1:29:37.330 --> 1:29:40.124
over the Holman-Moody Ford
driven by Walt Hansgen.

1:29:41.251 --> 1:29:43.419
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1:29:58.810 --> 1:30:00.352
(tires screeching)

1:30:02.064 --> 1:30:05.107
Oh, this race is not just
a test of our cars,

1:30:05.192 --> 1:30:06.567
but also our teams.

1:30:06.651 --> 1:30:08.694
As you know, we have
a second team out there today.

1:30:08.779 --> 1:30:10.362
- Holman-Moody.
- That's right.

1:30:11.114 --> 1:30:14.075
COMMENTATOR: Number 95, Hansgen,
blisters through the front tri-oval

1:30:14.159 --> 1:30:16.160
while closing in on Ken Miles.

1:30:16.244 --> 1:30:17.661
Walt's pushing her too fast.

1:30:17.746 --> 1:30:20.039
He's pushing 7,000 RPM.

1:30:20.123 --> 1:30:21.540
Hey, get the EZ sign out there.

1:30:21.625 --> 1:30:23.375
Come on. Move. Do it now.

1:30:23.460 --> 1:30:27.213
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

1:30:27.297 --> 1:30:30.299
And of course the supervision
of Henry Ford ll.

1:30:30.383 --> 1:30:33.219
The drivers, the speed, the strategy...

1:30:33.804 --> 1:30:36.639
even the RPMs are determined by us.

1:30:36.723 --> 1:30:40.392
(engines roaring)

1:30:40.477 --> 1:30:42.121
COMMENTATOR: Ken Miles
is locked in a pitched battle

1:30:42.145 --> 1:30:45.022
with Hansgen as they pass the grandstand.

1:30:48.318 --> 1:30:51.153
Hansgen is taking a run
at Miles entering turn one.

1:30:51.238 --> 1:30:52.530
Miles is boxed in.

1:30:52.614 --> 1:30:56.867
Hansgen slips by and takes the lead
approaching the infield chicane.

1:30:58.245 --> 1:30:59.453
(tires screech)

1:30:59.538 --> 1:31:05.501
(grunts)

1:31:06.795 --> 1:31:07.920
Cor blimey!

1:31:08.004 --> 1:31:09.004
Did you see that?

1:31:09.589 --> 1:31:11.069
COMMENTATOR: The caution flag is out.

1:31:12.592 --> 1:31:14.510

1:31:15.804 --> 1:31:16.804
(exhales sharply)

1:31:17.430 --> 1:31:19.974
Still racing. Hey, we are still racing.

1:31:20.058 --> 1:31:21.058
Come on, guys, let's go!

1:31:21.143 --> 1:31:22.143
Let's go. Move it.

1:31:22.227 --> 1:31:23.227
CARROLL: He's coming in.

1:31:24.229 --> 1:31:26.355

1:31:26.439 --> 1:31:27.815
MAN 2: Go, tires up.

1:31:27.899 --> 1:31:29.585
MAN 3: Here, right here.
Let's go. Let's go. Move it.

1:31:29.609 --> 1:31:31.485
- MAN 4: Fuel flying in.
- MAN 2: Breaker bar!

1:31:31.570 --> 1:31:33.172
- We're good.
- MAN 4: It all checked out.

1:31:33.196 --> 1:31:34.905
- 36. 38.
- MAN 1: Go! Go!

1:31:34.990 --> 1:31:37.408
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1:31:37.492 --> 1:31:39.220
If I can just get
outta the pit ahead of him...

1:31:39.244 --> 1:31:41.871
KEN: She's running hot,
but I think she'll hold.

1:31:41.955 --> 1:31:43.474
- MAN 1: Fuel's low.
- MAN 2: Bring up the scoop.

1:31:43.498 --> 1:31:44.582
She's hot.

1:31:47.002 --> 1:31:48.878
CARROLL: Hey there, Walt. Good to see you.

1:31:48.962 --> 1:31:51.881
Yeah, after I get out of this pit, Shelby,
it's the last time you will.

1:31:51.965 --> 1:31:52.965
Oh, don't worry.

1:31:53.049 --> 1:31:54.175
We got rearview mirrors.

1:31:55.719 --> 1:31:57.399
What happened to that Mustang he took out?

1:31:58.138 --> 1:31:59.597
Don't know yet.

1:31:59.681 --> 1:32:02.474
I can push her harder than six, Shel.

1:32:02.559 --> 1:32:04.768
- I can feel it.
- Uh-huh.

1:32:08.523 --> 1:32:12.401
Hey, how come these guys pit
so much faster than we do?

1:32:12.485 --> 1:32:16.030
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1:32:16.114 --> 1:32:17.781
- No shit?
- No shit.

1:32:18.408 --> 1:32:20.117
MAN: Go! Go, come on.

1:32:21.578 --> 1:32:23.287
We're clear, we're clear.

1:32:23.371 --> 1:32:24.538
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1:32:24.623 --> 1:32:26.165
MEN: Go, go, go!

1:32:26.708 --> 1:32:28.292
Guys, they've already left.

1:32:28.376 --> 1:32:29.793
(phone ringing)

1:32:31.087 --> 1:32:32.213
Hello?

1:32:32.297 --> 1:32:34.173
KEN: There's my Mollie. Hello.

1:32:34.883 --> 1:32:36.008
Hiya, love.

1:32:36.092 --> 1:32:37.927
- Mom? Mom?
- What are you doing?

1:32:38.011 --> 1:32:39.053
Just having a cuppa.

1:32:39.137 --> 1:32:40.763
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

1:32:40.847 --> 1:32:43.140
- Go to bed. It's 1:00 a.m.
- Ask him.

1:32:43.225 --> 1:32:44.683
Go to bed. Now.

1:32:44.768 --> 1:32:46.560
I take it he's not asleep.

1:32:46.645 --> 1:32:48.395
I'm sure he smuggled in a radio.

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:49.855
Yeah. (chuckles)

1:32:49.940 --> 1:32:51.292
He said to ask, "How are the brakes?"

1:32:51.316 --> 1:32:53.150
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

1:32:53.235 --> 1:32:55.319
Tell him they're working for now.

1:32:55.403 --> 1:32:58.072
You know, Shelby's been acting
very strange.

1:32:58.156 --> 1:32:59.281
- Ford have gone...
- Ken.

1:32:59.366 --> 1:33:00.574
And put up another team.

1:33:00.659 --> 1:33:02.034
- With a GT.
- Ken.

1:33:02.118 --> 1:33:05.454
Some sort of yampy, bloody
corporate test or something, I dunno.

1:33:05.538 --> 1:33:07.581
Just take a rest
whenever you get a chance.

1:33:07.666 --> 1:33:09.060
Sorry, my love, what were you saying?

1:33:09.084 --> 1:33:10.501
You've only got a few hours.

1:33:10.585 --> 1:33:11.752
I can't hear you very well.

1:33:11.836 --> 1:33:13.087
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

1:33:13.171 --> 1:33:14.380
Wish me luck.

1:33:14.464 --> 1:33:16.131

Ain't nothing Miles can do

Engine's hot. We gotta keep it
under six thou.

1:33:35.735 --> 1:33:37.736
(indistinct conversation)

1:34:52.062 --> 1:34:53.437
One way to find out.

1:34:56.566 --> 1:34:58.692
I thought we were keeping him under 6,000?

1:37:14.078 --> 1:37:16.288
COMMENTATOR: Ken Miles
takes the checkered flag,

1:37:16.372 --> 1:37:18.123
bringing glory to Shelby American.

1:37:18.708 --> 1:37:20.626
(laughing)

1:37:21.336 --> 1:37:22.377
How about that?

1:37:22.462 --> 1:37:24.338
(all cheering)

1:37:29.552 --> 1:37:30.844
(exhales)

1:37:32.847 --> 1:37:34.765
- (phone ringing)
- Reliability, strength...

1:37:34.849 --> 1:37:35.766
Yes, Leo.

1:37:35.850 --> 1:37:37.643
LEO: Mr. Ford, sir, we won.

1:37:38.895 --> 1:37:39.895
Uh-huh.

1:37:39.979 --> 1:37:42.189
We won! Ford won Daytona.

1:37:42.273 --> 1:37:44.024
- Hot damn.
- (applause)

1:37:44.108 --> 1:37:45.651
And which team was it, Leo?

1:37:47.195 --> 1:37:49.613
Shelby American. Miles driving.

1:37:51.366 --> 1:37:52.699
Son of a bitch.

1:37:53.701 --> 1:37:55.262
- CARROLL: All right.
- (indistinct chatter)

1:37:55.286 --> 1:37:56.620
Where the hell is he?

1:37:56.704 --> 1:37:58.705
Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait.

1:37:58.790 --> 1:38:00.958
Someone lost a bulldog on the beach.

1:38:01.042 --> 1:38:02.543
(all cheering)

1:38:02.627 --> 1:38:04.378
No, no. Come on. Come on.

1:38:05.463 --> 1:38:08.632
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1:38:08.716 --> 1:38:11.260
Someone get this man a drink.
Someone get him a drink.

1:38:27.151 --> 1:38:28.151
KEN: Oi.

1:38:29.279 --> 1:38:31.321
In bed, you. What are you doing?

1:38:32.073 --> 1:38:33.407
Dirty stop out.

1:38:33.950 --> 1:38:34.950
I was...

1:38:35.994 --> 1:38:38.579
drawing a map, so I could
follow you on Le Mans.

1:38:39.205 --> 1:38:40.247
KEN: Mmm.

1:38:42.584 --> 1:38:44.251
- (switch clicks)
- Look at that.

1:38:45.753 --> 1:38:47.462
That is spot on.

1:38:47.547 --> 1:38:49.548
You are a dab hand, very accurate.

1:38:51.593 --> 1:38:53.093
Tell me about the track.

1:38:53.177 --> 1:38:54.845
No, I can't, Petey.

1:38:54.929 --> 1:38:55.929
Please.

1:39:04.814 --> 1:39:06.732
Well, you start at the start line.

1:39:07.567 --> 1:39:09.484
PETER: Yeah, but you actually start here

1:39:09.569 --> 1:39:11.570
because you have to run
to your car at Le Mans.

1:39:11.654 --> 1:39:13.071
True enough.

1:39:13.156 --> 1:39:16.283
So, once your old man manages
to hobble over...

1:39:17.035 --> 1:39:19.411
- and pull out...
- And not hit anyone.

1:39:19.495 --> 1:39:21.413
- Yes, right.
- (chuckles)

1:39:22.290 --> 1:39:25.751
Then you accelerate very hard
up to Dunlop Bridge...

1:39:26.753 --> 1:39:28.670
road banking away from ya

1:39:28.755 --> 1:39:31.590
and down through the trees to the Esses...

1:39:31.674 --> 1:39:33.800
and accelerate up to Tertre Rouge.

1:39:33.885 --> 1:39:35.927
Critical first gear corner.

1:39:36.596 --> 1:39:37.804
Fast entry.

1:39:38.306 --> 1:39:40.849
Keep your speed up for your exit onto...

1:39:42.018 --> 1:39:43.185
Mulsanne.

1:39:43.811 --> 1:39:46.563
Long straightaway, hemmed in by poplars.

1:39:46.648 --> 1:39:49.733
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

1:39:50.193 --> 1:39:52.319
And down to third, revs up.

1:39:52.403 --> 1:39:53.779
Revs are your friend.

1:39:54.697 --> 1:39:58.200
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.

1:39:58.284 --> 1:40:00.202
Over the brow...

1:40:00.286 --> 1:40:01.370
then wham!

1:40:03.039 --> 1:40:04.373
Mulsanne Corner.

1:40:04.457 --> 1:40:07.084
Accelerate to Arnage

1:40:07.168 --> 1:40:08.729
and then over the rise to the White House.

1:40:08.753 --> 1:40:10.629
You get that right and...

1:40:10.713 --> 1:40:12.255
(inhales sharply)

1:40:14.008 --> 1:40:16.093
your first three and a half minutes...

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:18.637
of 24 hours.

1:40:19.931 --> 1:40:26.395
But... you can't make every lap perfect.

1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:28.897
But I can try.

1:40:34.737 --> 1:40:36.071
All right.

1:40:37.115 --> 1:40:38.448
Off to bed, you.

1:40:39.992 --> 1:40:41.118
(Ken exhales deeply)

1:40:41.202 --> 1:40:43.912
I will... wake you...

1:40:45.039 --> 1:40:46.331
before I leave for France.

1:40:47.166 --> 1:40:48.166
I promise.

1:40:48.668 --> 1:40:50.836
Okay. Good night.

1:41:02.849 --> 1:41:05.016
- (pop music playing on stereo)
- (indistinct chatter)

1:41:13.443 --> 1:41:17.320
- (boy shouting in French)
- (bell tolling in distance)

1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:20.115
Eh, where's, um...

1:41:20.992 --> 1:41:23.744
Where's that? The Hotel Saint Pierre?

1:41:23.828 --> 1:41:25.078
(speaks French)

1:41:25.163 --> 1:41:26.455
Where?

1:41:28.124 --> 1:41:31.209
(man singing drunkenly
in French in distance)

1:41:38.634 --> 1:41:40.886
(singing continues)

1:42:12.794 --> 1:42:14.586
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1:42:16.547 --> 1:42:17.756
(chuckles)

1:42:20.009 --> 1:42:21.551
There's always rain here.

1:42:25.014 --> 1:42:26.598
Start'll be dry though,

1:42:26.682 --> 1:42:29.851
so we'll swap out your tires come rain.

1:42:32.522 --> 1:42:33.939
Yeah.

1:42:36.359 --> 1:42:40.612
(sighs) Might be smart to sleep, Bulldog.

1:42:42.657 --> 1:42:44.157
Well, you, too.

1:42:44.951 --> 1:42:46.076
I'm not driving.

1:42:46.494 --> 1:42:47.702
(chuckles)

1:42:48.955 --> 1:42:52.082
That's a bloody shame, that.

1:42:52.458 --> 1:42:54.209
Oh, hell, I couldn't make this team.

1:42:54.836 --> 1:42:56.044
(chuckles)

1:42:59.465 --> 1:43:01.299
I'm gonna go walk the first corner.

1:43:03.261 --> 1:43:04.761
I figured.

1:43:13.104 --> 1:43:14.145
(Carroll chuckles)

1:43:15.648 --> 1:43:16.773
Counting on it.

1:43:23.322 --> 1:43:25.115
(indistinct chatter)

1:43:25.867 --> 1:43:27.868
(indistinct announcements on speaker)

1:43:41.215 --> 1:43:44.217
(fanfare playing on loudspeakers)

1:43:44.302 --> 1:43:47.679
(crowd cheering and whistling)

1:43:51.642 --> 1:43:52.934
Ken.

1:43:53.019 --> 1:43:54.352
Chaz.

1:44:00.026 --> 1:44:01.253
CHARLIE: We'll change
the color of them seats,

1:44:01.277 --> 1:44:02.277
shall we, Frost?

1:44:02.361 --> 1:44:05.196
(indistinct chatter)

1:44:08.451 --> 1:44:10.660
KEN: Well, if this were
a beauty pageant...

1:44:11.203 --> 1:44:12.621
we just lost.

1:44:13.789 --> 1:44:14.873
Looks fast, don't it?

1:44:14.957 --> 1:44:17.334
Ah, looks aren't everything.

1:44:21.589 --> 1:44:24.466
Scarfiotti and Bandini start for Ferrari.

1:44:30.306 --> 1:44:31.556
You can take him.

1:44:31.641 --> 1:44:33.892
PHIL: Four minutes, Ken.
Four minutes, buddy.

1:44:33.976 --> 1:44:35.287

1:44:35.311 --> 1:44:37.437

1:44:37.521 --> 1:44:39.105
MOLLIE: All right, coming.

1:44:39.941 --> 1:44:42.484
BROCKMAN: The 24 Hours of Le Mans.

1:44:42.568 --> 1:44:44.069
And there are the cars lined up...

1:44:47.156 --> 1:44:49.196

MAN: They're lined up
as per their practice times.

1:45:12.264 --> 1:45:13.504
Faster cars are up to our left.

1:45:58.269 --> 1:46:00.770

1:46:04.817 --> 1:46:06.818
- Oh, bloody joker!
- (tires screeching)

1:46:12.283 --> 1:46:14.534
BROCKMAN: Number 10, a Bizzarrini,
almost loses control.

1:46:15.202 --> 1:46:16.661
It's all right.

1:46:16.746 --> 1:46:19.080
(announcer speaking in French)

1:46:19.165 --> 1:46:20.707
You looked great out there, sir.

1:46:21.834 --> 1:46:23.168

1:46:30.176 --> 1:46:31.342

No.

1:46:38.893 --> 1:46:41.311
(grunting)

1:46:43.272 --> 1:46:45.148
Poxy bastard.

1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:12.342
(engine revving)

1:47:21.018 --> 1:47:24.896

1:47:26.232 --> 1:47:27.857

1:47:28.692 --> 1:47:30.360
Where is Miles?

1:47:32.571 --> 1:47:34.614
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

1:47:43.749 --> 1:47:44.749
He's coming in.

1:47:44.834 --> 1:47:45.959
Oi! He's coming in.

BROCKMAN: That's a rough start
for the Ford team so early...

1:47:56.679 --> 1:47:59.889
The bloody door won't close!

1:47:59.974 --> 1:48:02.100

We'll take care of it.

1:48:06.730 --> 1:48:08.064
Shelby, what the hell is wrong?

1:48:08.732 --> 1:48:09.876
MAN: Something's hitting the frame.

1:48:09.900 --> 1:48:11.776
Oh, you're joking, aren't ya?

1:48:12.528 --> 1:48:14.112
Guys, get outta the way.

1:48:14.196 --> 1:48:15.530

1:49:30.272 --> 1:49:31.773
Shelby.

1:49:31.857 --> 1:49:34.776
He's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1:49:35.611 --> 1:49:36.861
Plans change.

1:49:53.963 --> 1:49:56.005

1:50:43.387 --> 1:50:44.595
(grunts)

1:50:45.973 --> 1:50:47.974
You're three seconds faster than Gurney.

1:50:48.058 --> 1:50:50.036
If you hadn't blown the start,
you'd be in the lead.

1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:51.394
Can you keep this up?

1:50:51.478 --> 1:50:53.229

MRS. FORD: Thank you.

1:51:43.113 --> 1:51:44.822
Have a good dinner, sir.

Oi, McLaren's pitting.

Mr. Ford's probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1:51:53.624 --> 1:51:55.333
What do you mean "probably"?

1:51:55.417 --> 1:51:56.793
Rain's coming.

1:52:04.301 --> 1:52:06.302
(thunder rumbling)

1:52:13.852 --> 1:52:15.186
CHARLIE: Coming in.

1:52:17.940 --> 1:52:19.482
MAN 1: Go, tires up!

1:52:22.486 --> 1:52:23.546
MAN 2: Get 'em checked out.

1:52:23.570 --> 1:52:25.488
Engine's running hot, Pops.

1:52:25.572 --> 1:52:27.365

- She's hot, mate. Crack on.

1:52:27.449 --> 1:52:29.009
- MAN 1: Go.
- MAN 2: Well done, Denny.

1:52:30.577 --> 1:52:31.786
Tire.

1:52:32.663 --> 1:52:33.704
Dash clear.

1:52:34.665 --> 1:52:35.790
Swap.

1:52:35.874 --> 1:52:37.542
(indistinct chatter)

1:52:38.627 --> 1:52:40.086
We're at 220. We're okay.

1:52:40.587 --> 1:52:41.754
All right.

1:52:41.839 --> 1:52:43.339
MAN 1: Fuel flying in.

1:52:43.424 --> 1:52:44.966
MAN 2: Rear tires coming up the wall!

1:52:45.050 --> 1:52:46.319
MAN 3: Get the fuel in there.
Come on. Let's go.

1:52:46.343 --> 1:52:47.343
MAN 4: Swap that out.

1:52:47.719 --> 1:52:49.095
(grunting)

1:52:49.555 --> 1:52:50.638
MAN 1: Front set.

1:52:51.223 --> 1:52:52.473
MAN 2: We're good.

1:52:56.353 --> 1:52:57.937

1:52:58.522 --> 1:52:59.689
MAN: Go, go!

1:53:04.153 --> 1:53:05.403
PHIL: Good job, guys. Good job.

1:53:05.487 --> 1:53:07.155
CHARLIE: It was a good change, fellas.

1:53:07.239 --> 1:53:08.406
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

1:53:08.490 --> 1:53:10.241
(indistinct chatter)

1:53:17.374 --> 1:53:20.918
(conversing in Italian)

1:53:22.963 --> 1:53:29.927
Did you see that? The great American automobile
magnate leaves in a helicopter. Very classy.

1:53:30.554 --> 1:53:32.638
(men shouting in Italian)

1:53:38.812 --> 1:53:42.857
COMMENTATOR: Lorenzo Bandini remains
in first place for Ferrari.

1:53:57.748 --> 1:53:59.665
KEN: Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

1:53:59.750 --> 1:54:01.667
He's not batting
on a full wicket, that one.

1:54:07.466 --> 1:54:08.758
Easy, Dan.

1:54:09.384 --> 1:54:10.384
(bursts)

1:54:10.844 --> 1:54:12.011
Oh, bloody hell!

1:54:13.639 --> 1:54:15.306
You arsehole.

1:54:17.100 --> 1:54:19.185
(engine revs)

1:54:28.612 --> 1:54:30.363
(tires screeching)

1:54:32.157 --> 1:54:33.491
Oh, piss off!

1:54:36.870 --> 1:54:38.454
You wanker!

1:54:41.124 --> 1:54:42.500
(tires screech)

1:54:44.962 --> 1:54:48.965
A face like a smacked arse,
now, don't ya? (laughs)

1:54:49.049 --> 1:54:51.259
(men shouting in Italian)

1:54:55.055 --> 1:54:57.765
(shouting in Italian)

1:55:01.353 --> 1:55:03.938
COMMENTATOR: Porsche number 58
with an unidentified Ford

1:55:04.439 --> 1:55:06.524
are run off the track at Arnage.

1:55:07.401 --> 1:55:09.610
MAN: Go, Ken. Come on, Ken.

1:55:17.369 --> 1:55:19.078
Nice stopwatch.

1:55:19.705 --> 1:55:21.497
You want one? They're Italian.

1:55:44.563 --> 1:55:48.065
BROCKMAN: Ken Miles in Ford number 1
and Bandini in Ferrari 21

1:55:48.150 --> 1:55:49.794
are locked in a battle
against the elements

1:55:49.818 --> 1:55:53.404
as they push their cars to the limit
past the White House corner.

1:55:53.488 --> 1:55:56.240
And now with all that rain,
the track conditions are wet and slippery

1:55:56.325 --> 1:55:58.743
so expect these very fast laps to suffer.

1:56:01.580 --> 1:56:02.663
Yes, sir?

1:56:04.082 --> 1:56:06.751
Yes, sir.

1:56:07.836 --> 1:56:09.629
Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

1:56:16.136 --> 1:56:17.136
Hey!

1:56:18.513 --> 1:56:20.473
What the hell are you doing? Give me that.

1:56:23.143 --> 1:56:24.143
Dumbass.

1:56:24.645 --> 1:56:25.811
Mr. Shelby...

1:56:59.221 --> 1:57:00.721
(metallic squealing)

1:57:08.063 --> 1:57:09.063
Here we go.

1:57:13.026 --> 1:57:14.026
Come on, girl.

1:57:14.111 --> 1:57:15.319
Come on.

1:57:21.535 --> 1:57:22.952
Hold it together now.

1:57:33.296 --> 1:57:34.588
(grunts)

1:57:37.718 --> 1:57:38.926
God!

1:57:40.929 --> 1:57:42.638
Bugger! Come on.

1:57:42.723 --> 1:57:45.433
BROCKMAN: The leader at this
moment is Ferrari number 21

1:57:45.517 --> 1:57:47.518
being driven by Lorenzo Bandini.

1:57:47.602 --> 1:57:50.146
His brakes are shot.
All right, here we go.

1:57:50.605 --> 1:57:53.441
It looks like Ken Miles is
bringing the number 1 Ford

1:57:53.525 --> 1:57:55.086
into the pits very slowly.
He could have a...

1:57:55.110 --> 1:57:57.486
PHIL: Coming in. Watch yourself, guys.

1:57:58.405 --> 1:58:00.865
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
- PHIL: Yeah.

1:58:00.949 --> 1:58:03.284
All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:58:04.953 --> 1:58:07.913
I had him. I almost had him.

1:58:09.374 --> 1:58:11.792
Well, he's putting another lap on us now.

1:58:11.877 --> 1:58:14.712
PHIL: All right. Fit it in.
Do the upper arm first.

1:58:14.796 --> 1:58:16.566
CHARLIE: Come on, let's go.
Come in now, now. Faster.

1:58:16.590 --> 1:58:17.590
PHIL: Let's go.

1:58:17.674 --> 1:58:18.966
Upper arm first.

1:58:19.718 --> 1:58:21.343
Watch the brake line pulling it out.

1:58:21.428 --> 1:58:23.471
They're doing it. The brakes.

1:58:23.555 --> 1:58:24.782
BROCKMAN: Now, that's gonna take...

1:58:24.806 --> 1:58:26.390
CHARLIE: I said watch the brake line.

1:58:26.475 --> 1:58:28.267
CHARLIE: Faster! Faster! Faster!

1:58:28.351 --> 1:58:29.495
MAN: Coming in. Watch your back!

1:58:29.519 --> 1:58:30.788
CHARLIE: Jeff, you've gotta be faster!

1:58:30.812 --> 1:58:32.354
(conversing in Italian)

1:58:44.618 --> 1:58:45.720
CHARLIE: Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

1:58:45.744 --> 1:58:46.827
MAN: No, no, no.

1:58:47.287 --> 1:58:49.747
It's against the rules.
You cannot just change things.

1:58:49.831 --> 1:58:51.081
Oh, no, no, no.

1:58:51.166 --> 1:58:54.960
You show me where it says in your book
that we cannot swap out the system,

1:58:55.045 --> 1:58:56.147
and then you can disqualify us.

1:58:56.171 --> 1:58:57.171
Bulldog, back off.

1:58:57.255 --> 1:58:59.215
Calm down. Calm down.

1:58:59.299 --> 1:59:00.633
This is not legal.

1:59:00.717 --> 1:59:02.487
You show me where it says
in that little rule book

1:59:02.511 --> 1:59:04.678
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

1:59:04.763 --> 1:59:06.222
A part is a part.

1:59:06.306 --> 1:59:08.075
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor,
or an upright assembly,

1:59:08.099 --> 1:59:09.850
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

1:59:10.936 --> 1:59:12.478
We read your damn rule book.

1:59:16.858 --> 1:59:18.442
(man shouting in Italian)

1:59:18.527 --> 1:59:20.444
(in English) Bandini's pitting.
He's pitting.

1:59:21.446 --> 1:59:23.280
(man shouting in Italian)

1:59:27.661 --> 1:59:29.620
- Oh, what a shame.
- (chuckles)

1:59:29.704 --> 1:59:30.871
I think he blew a line.

1:59:30.956 --> 1:59:32.556
Well, he was trying to keep up with you.

1:59:34.209 --> 1:59:37.044
(shouting in Italian)

1:59:42.551 --> 1:59:44.552
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

1:59:45.470 --> 1:59:47.054
(shouting continues)

1:59:56.106 --> 1:59:57.898
Get me out of here, Pops.

1:59:57.983 --> 1:59:59.085
- Come on!
- PHIL: All right.

1:59:59.109 --> 2:00:00.442
KEN: Come on!

2:00:00.527 --> 2:00:02.069
PHIL: Almost there, Ken. Almost there.

2:00:02.571 --> 2:00:03.612
How's it looking, buddy?

2:00:03.697 --> 2:00:04.897
MAN: One pump, and we're good.

2:00:05.365 --> 2:00:06.532
PHIL: Car's yours, Ken.

2:00:06.616 --> 2:00:09.136
All right, listen, you can still take him,
but you gotta pass him twice.

2:00:09.160 --> 2:00:11.161
I get it. Pass him twice.

2:00:18.211 --> 2:00:19.753
Ford number 1 driven by Ken Miles

2:00:19.838 --> 2:00:23.132
is back out, hot on the heels
of Bandini in Ferrari 21.

2:00:31.224 --> 2:00:33.517
(men conversing in Italian)

2:00:53.163 --> 2:00:56.081
(shouting in Italian)

2:01:20.231 --> 2:01:21.231
(man whooping)

2:01:22.025 --> 2:01:25.027
Not bloody good enough, Miles! Come on!

2:01:25.487 --> 2:01:26.820
He's off his pace.

2:01:28.657 --> 2:01:30.491
He doesn't trust the car yet.

2:01:31.076 --> 2:01:33.661
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

2:01:40.001 --> 2:01:41.210
All right.

2:01:42.504 --> 2:01:44.421
What did you come here for?

2:01:46.508 --> 2:01:47.716
Let's do it.

2:02:05.318 --> 2:02:06.694
(tires screeching)

2:02:09.447 --> 2:02:10.447
(crowd cheering)

2:02:12.283 --> 2:02:14.076
That's it! Come on!

2:02:25.296 --> 2:02:26.505
He ain't done it yet.

2:02:30.385 --> 2:02:32.344
He needs to take another lap on him.

2:02:54.784 --> 2:02:56.118
(crowd cheering)

2:02:56.202 --> 2:02:57.870
He needs to pit soon.

2:02:57.954 --> 2:03:00.289
He needs to catch Bandini first.

2:03:04.169 --> 2:03:05.586
(engine revs)

2:03:06.087 --> 2:03:07.504
(tires screeching)

2:03:10.467 --> 2:03:12.009
All right, you bastard.

2:03:13.261 --> 2:03:14.553
Let's do this again.

2:03:16.514 --> 2:03:18.432
(engine revving)

2:03:26.858 --> 2:03:29.318
(engine roaring)

2:03:44.375 --> 2:03:45.584
Come on.

2:03:46.294 --> 2:03:48.212
That's my girl! That's my girl!

2:04:04.187 --> 2:04:05.938
- (exclaiming)
- (rattling)

2:04:08.441 --> 2:04:11.026
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2:04:11.611 --> 2:04:12.903
Bloody hell!

2:04:12.987 --> 2:04:15.155
(uplifting music playing)

2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:29.461
- He did it. We're in the lead.
- (crowd cheering)

2:04:29.546 --> 2:04:30.963
Are we in the lead?

2:04:31.047 --> 2:04:32.673
What about Bandini?

2:04:33.258 --> 2:04:34.508
Where's Bandini?

2:04:35.301 --> 2:04:37.010
PHIL: They're done. Finished.

2:04:37.637 --> 2:04:39.012
Ferrari's over.

2:04:39.097 --> 2:04:41.140
McLaren's four minutes behind him in a GT.

2:04:41.224 --> 2:04:44.476
So we're lying Ken first,
and two and three. All Fords.

2:04:56.948 --> 2:04:59.116
(conversing in Italian)

2:05:00.368 --> 2:05:02.012
COMMENTATOR (in English):
Ferrari number 21

2:05:02.036 --> 2:05:04.329
and driver Bandini have left the track.

2:05:04.414 --> 2:05:05.873
(crowd cheering)

2:05:06.666 --> 2:05:07.958
The Deuce is coming.

2:05:17.302 --> 2:05:20.262
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Want me to wake him?

2:05:20.346 --> 2:05:21.555
Nah, let him sleep.

2:05:22.891 --> 2:05:24.702
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

2:05:24.726 --> 2:05:26.059
- FORD: Hello.
- MAN: Mr. Ford.

2:05:26.144 --> 2:05:27.246
We're not quite there yet, but...

2:05:27.270 --> 2:05:28.604
FORD: You missed a good meal.

2:05:28.688 --> 2:05:30.272
LEO: There he is. There he is.

2:05:32.192 --> 2:05:33.442
Brief me, Leo.

2:05:34.277 --> 2:05:36.361
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

2:05:37.572 --> 2:05:40.282
- Who's in the lead?
- Hulme, Miles.

2:05:42.660 --> 2:05:44.286
You know, I was thinking, Mr. Ford...

2:05:45.371 --> 2:05:48.874
wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

2:05:48.958 --> 2:05:50.958
and crossed the finish line
at the exact same time?

2:05:51.711 --> 2:05:53.754
They all lined up and came home together.

2:05:53.838 --> 2:05:55.923
Ford. Ford. Ford.

2:05:56.674 --> 2:05:58.800
I don't think we can
actually do that, sir, but...

2:06:00.136 --> 2:06:01.386
Why not?

2:06:02.430 --> 2:06:04.681
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

2:06:04.766 --> 2:06:07.351
What would you have him do, slow down?

2:06:08.770 --> 2:06:09.895
Yeah.

2:06:17.028 --> 2:06:19.446
LEO: Mr. Ford wants Miles to slow down.

2:06:19.530 --> 2:06:21.823
He wants all three cars to
cross at the exact same time.

2:06:21.908 --> 2:06:23.825
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford.

2:06:23.910 --> 2:06:25.535
It'll make a great photograph.

2:06:27.205 --> 2:06:29.748
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here,

2:06:29.832 --> 2:06:31.291
and so do you.

2:06:31.376 --> 2:06:33.085
You gonna tell him, or you need me to?

2:06:33.169 --> 2:06:34.670
(mug clatters)

2:06:34.754 --> 2:06:37.130
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

2:06:38.216 --> 2:06:39.549
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

2:06:39.634 --> 2:06:40.842
Go on now.

2:06:41.427 --> 2:06:42.970
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

2:07:00.071 --> 2:07:02.341
- PHIL: Guys, let's go. Come on.
- CHARLIE: All right, look lively, boys.

2:07:02.365 --> 2:07:03.615
PHIL: Let's go. Frosty.

2:07:03.700 --> 2:07:05.033
FROSTY: Yeah, coming.

2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:08.996
- PHIL: Let's go. Come on.
- What's Beebe want?

2:07:13.459 --> 2:07:14.960
(laughing) Oh.

2:07:15.044 --> 2:07:16.795
It's off the scale, innit?

2:07:22.302 --> 2:07:23.885
They want you to slow down.

2:07:28.182 --> 2:07:29.558
Run that by me again.

2:07:30.268 --> 2:07:31.601
They want you to slow down.

2:07:34.522 --> 2:07:36.064
You're outshining their car, Ken.

2:07:36.149 --> 2:07:37.858
You're four minutes up on McLaren.

2:07:37.942 --> 2:07:39.401
The Deuce wants the three Fords

2:07:39.485 --> 2:07:41.862
to cross the finish line
one, two, three, all together.

2:07:47.493 --> 2:07:49.536
They're asking that
you be a team player...

2:07:51.247 --> 2:07:52.808
and make that photograph happen for 'em.

2:07:52.832 --> 2:07:56.126
That photograph. That's good.

2:07:56.794 --> 2:07:59.254
That is good. Mmm.

2:08:01.507 --> 2:08:03.175
Ken, even if you tie for first...

2:08:04.302 --> 2:08:06.178
you'd still be the first man
ever to win...

2:08:06.846 --> 2:08:09.306
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans
in the same year.

2:08:10.099 --> 2:08:11.433
You'd have the triple crown.

2:08:18.941 --> 2:08:20.192
Look, I ain't get...

2:08:21.778 --> 2:08:23.464
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an order

2:08:23.488 --> 2:08:25.030
since day one.

2:08:25.114 --> 2:08:26.907
Whatever you wanna do is fine with me.

2:08:28.743 --> 2:08:30.160
My choice?

2:08:31.662 --> 2:08:32.829
Your choice.

2:08:34.874 --> 2:08:36.875
(indistinct announcement over speakers)

2:08:39.670 --> 2:08:41.463
DENNY: The engine's running at boiling.

2:08:41.547 --> 2:08:42.839
The brakes are shot.

2:08:45.968 --> 2:08:47.219
How was that?

2:08:48.971 --> 2:08:49.971
Taken care of.

2:08:50.390 --> 2:08:51.973
PHIL: The car's yours, Ken.

2:08:52.058 --> 2:08:53.350
CHARLIE: Ken, the car's yours.

2:08:54.519 --> 2:08:55.560
Ken!

2:08:55.645 --> 2:08:57.145
Car's yours, Ken.

2:09:09.158 --> 2:09:11.118
(crowd cheering)

2:09:26.259 --> 2:09:27.676
(men cheering)

2:09:30.346 --> 2:09:32.324
BROCKMAN: It's the Fords
that are the cars to beat,

2:09:32.348 --> 2:09:33.890
claiming the top three positions...

2:09:33.975 --> 2:09:35.225
What the hell is he doing?

2:09:35.309 --> 2:09:36.662
Led by Ken Miles in Ford number 1...

2:09:36.686 --> 2:09:37.853
(phone ringing)

2:09:37.937 --> 2:09:40.397
COMMENTATOR: If you’re not
watching this right now...

2:09:40.481 --> 2:09:41.561
CARROLL: Don't answer that.

2:09:41.607 --> 2:09:44.651
Get away from it.

2:09:44.735 --> 2:09:47.279
COMMENTATOR: Ken Miles in Ford
number 1 is demonstrating

2:09:47.363 --> 2:09:50.407
why he's one of the top drivers
here at Le Mans

2:09:50.491 --> 2:09:52.492
with an outstanding display of skill.

2:09:53.035 --> 2:09:54.703
Keep an eye on Ford number 1.

2:10:11.762 --> 2:10:13.263
He's gonna break his own record.

2:10:13.347 --> 2:10:14.598
Shut up.

2:10:23.399 --> 2:10:27.652
Wait for it.

2:10:31.115 --> 2:10:32.115
Now.

2:10:33.117 --> 2:10:35.285
(engine revs)

2:10:35.369 --> 2:10:37.746
CROWD (chanting): Miles. Miles. Miles.

2:10:37.830 --> 2:10:42.209
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2:10:46.672 --> 2:10:54.672
(chanting continues)

2:11:16.035 --> 2:11:17.410
Bellissimo.

2:11:17.954 --> 2:11:20.705
3:30.6. That's another record.

2:11:23.084 --> 2:11:24.376
(chuckles)

2:11:25.127 --> 2:11:27.128
BROCKMAN: Another lap record
falls to Ken Miles...

2:11:27.213 --> 2:11:28.713
It's a perfect lap.

2:11:28.798 --> 2:11:30.651
Breaking his own record
and virtually guaranteeing

2:11:30.675 --> 2:11:32.926
first place for Shelby American

2:11:33.010 --> 2:11:34.594
and their exciting GT40.

2:11:34.679 --> 2:11:36.596
COMMENTATOR: Ken Miles in Shelby America's

2:11:36.681 --> 2:11:40.100
Ford number 1
just beat his own lap record.

2:11:40.184 --> 2:11:42.060
Three minutes and 30.6 seconds...

2:11:42.144 --> 2:11:43.144
Bring him in.

2:11:43.229 --> 2:11:44.938
Right now! He's outta control.

2:11:45.439 --> 2:11:47.524
Now, you bring him in
before he wrecks that car

2:11:47.608 --> 2:11:48.733
and we don't finish.

2:11:51.028 --> 2:11:52.404
Bring him in, Shelby,

2:11:52.488 --> 2:11:55.156
or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

2:11:57.034 --> 2:11:58.785
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.

2:11:59.328 --> 2:12:00.912
That's his car to the finish.

2:12:02.623 --> 2:12:04.708
♪ H-A-P-P-Y ♪

2:12:04.792 --> 2:12:06.960

2:12:07.044 --> 2:12:09.588
♪ I know I am, I'm sure I am ♪

2:12:10.339 --> 2:12:11.756
Woo!

2:12:12.633 --> 2:12:13.717
Oh.

2:12:20.224 --> 2:12:21.641
(panting)

2:13:25.581 --> 2:13:27.582
(soft instrumental music playing)

2:13:36.175 --> 2:13:37.842
Come on, lads, where are ya?

2:13:48.688 --> 2:13:49.790
BROCKMAN: That is quite a sight to see.

2:13:49.814 --> 2:13:50.855
PETER: What's he doing?

2:13:51.649 --> 2:13:53.149
Mum, why is he slowing down?

2:13:53.234 --> 2:13:55.360
The second and third place
Fords to close ranks.

2:13:55.444 --> 2:13:57.570
(announcer speaking in French)

2:14:20.177 --> 2:14:22.220
- (indistinct shouting)
- (phone ringing)

2:14:25.391 --> 2:14:28.101
The three Fords are going
to cross the line together.

2:14:28.185 --> 2:14:30.270
Ken Miles slowed down. He waited for them.

2:14:30.354 --> 2:14:31.540
- BROCKMAN: Here are the Fords...
- Dad.

2:14:31.564 --> 2:14:32.731
- Lined up in a row...
- No.

2:14:32.815 --> 2:14:34.065
- MOLLIE: It's all right.
- Dad.

2:14:34.150 --> 2:14:36.609
It's all right.
Look, he's bringing them in.

2:14:36.694 --> 2:14:37.754
BROCKMAN:
Led by Ken Miles...

2:14:37.778 --> 2:14:39.005
MOLLIE: He's bringing them
all in together.

2:14:39.029 --> 2:14:40.869
BROCKMAN: certainly
the leader of this group

2:14:40.906 --> 2:14:43.051
- and owner of the Le Mans lap record...
- Good for you.

2:14:43.075 --> 2:14:44.993
- Set just moments ago.
- Good for you, Ken.

2:14:48.914 --> 2:14:51.916
(crowd cheering)

2:15:03.262 --> 2:15:05.847
- Yeah! Yeah!
- (laughing)

2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:13.897
Look at that. (laughing)

2:15:16.317 --> 2:15:17.859
- Well done, Leo.
- You too, Don.

2:15:26.410 --> 2:15:28.453
(announcer speaking in French)

2:15:35.169 --> 2:15:36.419
COMMENTATOR: Please stand by.

2:15:36.504 --> 2:15:38.171
Final results are under review.

2:15:38.255 --> 2:15:40.295
CHARLIE: is explain to me
how he's finished first

2:15:40.341 --> 2:15:41.633
and he's not won the race?

2:15:41.717 --> 2:15:43.885
OFFICIAL: Because McLaren
started from further,

2:15:43.969 --> 2:15:45.428
so he came in... see, he won.

2:15:45.513 --> 2:15:46.596
Look, it's not a tie.

2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:47.764
No, because McLaren...

2:15:47.848 --> 2:15:49.328
Because McLaren started further back,

2:15:49.391 --> 2:15:51.036
he's saying he's traveled
that little bit further,

2:15:51.060 --> 2:15:52.477
so he's won and not Ken.

2:15:52.561 --> 2:15:54.437
PHIL: That is bullshit. That's bullshit.

2:15:54.522 --> 2:15:56.356
PHIL: Shel! Hold on!

2:15:58.734 --> 2:16:00.235
(crowd cheering)

2:16:10.412 --> 2:16:12.140
- CARROLL: Where's the tie?
- LEE: Hey, hey, hey.

2:16:12.164 --> 2:16:13.331
Where's the goddamn tie?

2:16:13.415 --> 2:16:14.499
What?

2:16:14.583 --> 2:16:15.977
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Shelby!

2:16:16.001 --> 2:16:17.377
- You knew!
- No, I didn't know!

2:16:17.461 --> 2:16:19.462
- That's enough! Enough!
- Get off me! Hey!

2:16:20.130 --> 2:16:21.714
(laughs) Bruce.

2:16:21.799 --> 2:16:23.508
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

2:16:28.430 --> 2:16:30.348
(indistinct chatter)

2:16:45.447 --> 2:16:46.739
Shel!

2:16:51.287 --> 2:16:52.745
They robbed you, Ken.

2:16:52.830 --> 2:16:54.581
COMMENTATOR: Here is the clarification.

2:16:54.665 --> 2:16:57.166
Though the drivers finished
the race in a heat,

2:16:57.251 --> 2:17:00.795
McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from farther back.

2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:02.630
PHIL: Some bullshit technicality.

2:17:02.715 --> 2:17:06.509
Final results. Ford number 2,
driven by McLaren and Amon,

2:17:06.594 --> 2:17:08.052
is the winner.

2:17:08.137 --> 2:17:12.056
Ford number 1, driven by Miles and Hulme,
second place.

2:17:12.141 --> 2:17:16.269
In third place, Bucknum and Hutcherson
in Ford number 5.

2:17:16.353 --> 2:17:17.604
I never should've asked you.

2:17:23.986 --> 2:17:25.528
Selling cars, huh?

2:17:28.407 --> 2:17:29.741
That's what they do.

2:17:30.951 --> 2:17:33.995
Well, you promised me the drive.

2:17:36.916 --> 2:17:38.041
Not the win.

2:17:39.335 --> 2:17:40.752
It was a hell of a drive.

2:17:41.921 --> 2:17:43.421
She's a hell of a machine.

2:17:44.214 --> 2:17:45.590
Oh, she's fast.

2:17:47.426 --> 2:17:48.801
Could be faster.

2:17:50.763 --> 2:17:52.138
The 7 liter's sweet...

2:17:52.806 --> 2:17:54.015
but, uh...

2:17:55.100 --> 2:17:56.893
we still need a lighter chassis.

2:17:56.977 --> 2:18:00.730
I was thinking bonded aluminium.

2:18:00.814 --> 2:18:03.608
It's a ground-up rebuild,
but if it works...

2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:06.527
we can lose a couple hundred pounds.

2:18:06.612 --> 2:18:08.321
Well, what the hell are we doing here?

2:18:10.032 --> 2:18:11.991
Let me take a shower, get a cup of tea...

2:18:12.701 --> 2:18:14.243
ham and cheese cob or something.

2:18:15.204 --> 2:18:17.084
CARROLL: We're gonna get
the bastards next year.

2:18:41.021 --> 2:18:43.398
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

2:18:44.733 --> 2:18:46.609
What do you think
of those honeycomb panels?

2:18:46.694 --> 2:18:48.236
What you were looking for?

2:18:48.696 --> 2:18:49.862
Don't know yet.

2:18:51.865 --> 2:18:52.991
(engine starts)

2:18:53.075 --> 2:18:55.034
(engine revs)

2:19:15.597 --> 2:19:17.223
She looks pretty good.

2:19:27.526 --> 2:19:31.070
CARROLL: There's a point at 7,000 RPM...

2:19:32.448 --> 2:19:34.449
where everything fades.

2:19:37.077 --> 2:19:39.328
The machine becomes weightless.

2:19:40.456 --> 2:19:41.581
Just disappears.

2:19:42.499 --> 2:19:43.583
Yeah!

2:19:43.667 --> 2:19:44.787
CARROLL: And all that's left

2:19:44.835 --> 2:19:45.918
is a body...

2:19:46.003 --> 2:19:47.712
moving through space and time.

2:19:51.300 --> 2:19:53.342
7,000 RPM.

2:19:54.511 --> 2:19:55.762
That's where you meet it.

2:19:58.057 --> 2:19:59.724
You feel it coming.

2:19:59.808 --> 2:20:01.851
It creeps up on you, close in your ear.

2:20:10.319 --> 2:20:11.778
Asks you a question.

2:20:13.072 --> 2:20:14.739
The only question that matters.

2:20:20.788 --> 2:20:21.871
PHIL: Get the van!

2:20:23.332 --> 2:20:24.707
CARROLL: "Who are you?"

2:20:55.114 --> 2:20:56.531
(indistinct chatter)

2:20:58.450 --> 2:20:59.617
MAN: What do you think?

2:20:59.701 --> 2:21:02.036
DAN: It's fantastic. Feels really good.

2:21:02.830 --> 2:21:04.038
Nice and smooth.

2:21:05.165 --> 2:21:07.166
No vibration in the box.
Feels really strong.

2:21:07.251 --> 2:21:09.210
You drove it for less than an hour.

2:21:09.795 --> 2:21:11.754
You can't tell shit after an hour.

2:21:11.839 --> 2:21:15.216
Go for seven even, that'd be 14 all in.

2:21:15.300 --> 2:21:16.425
Hey, Shel.

2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:29.605
Hey, Shel, that guy,
you know the one in the hat,

2:21:29.690 --> 2:21:32.275
he's ready to close on those two 427s.

2:21:32.359 --> 2:21:34.652
His and hers. Full freight.

2:21:35.654 --> 2:21:38.156
They, uh, flew in from Galveston.

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:39.407
CARROLL: Uh-huh.

2:21:40.868 --> 2:21:44.745
Uh, I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

2:21:45.706 --> 2:21:46.873
And do what?

2:21:48.709 --> 2:21:50.001
Be Carroll Shelby.

2:21:51.253 --> 2:21:53.421
Tell them a story, spin a few magic words.

2:21:54.590 --> 2:21:57.216
What does that mean? "Magic words"?

2:21:58.510 --> 2:21:59.594
It means...

2:22:00.179 --> 2:22:02.221
come outside and say hello

2:22:02.306 --> 2:22:04.348
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

2:22:04.433 --> 2:22:05.725
They're getting the damn cars.

2:22:05.809 --> 2:22:07.489
That's what they get
for their money, Phil.

2:22:07.561 --> 2:22:09.228
Now, either they want 'em or they don't.

2:22:09.313 --> 2:22:11.230
- Am I some kind of a lounge act?
- No.

2:22:11.315 --> 2:22:12.795
Am I here to talk people into things?

2:22:24.286 --> 2:22:26.037
It's been six months, Shel.

2:22:27.497 --> 2:22:29.373
- Six months.
- (sighs)

2:22:33.670 --> 2:22:35.880
PHIL: Sometimes they don't
get out of the car.

2:23:07.162 --> 2:23:08.371
(sighs)

2:23:11.375 --> 2:23:12.583
MOLLIE: Peter!

2:23:13.710 --> 2:23:16.254
Peter, come and take the garbage out.

2:23:16.338 --> 2:23:17.588
PETER: Mr. Shelby.

2:23:19.258 --> 2:23:20.508
Oh, hello, Pete.

2:23:22.678 --> 2:23:24.136
I remember that wrench.

2:23:25.430 --> 2:23:27.056
My dad threw it at you.

2:23:28.517 --> 2:23:29.642
I believe he did.

2:23:30.686 --> 2:23:31.852
PETER: Why?

2:23:34.648 --> 2:23:35.773
Oh.

2:23:36.858 --> 2:23:38.985
I think I probably said something to him.

2:23:39.987 --> 2:23:41.362
Called him a few names.

2:23:43.615 --> 2:23:44.907
That's right.

2:23:53.792 --> 2:23:55.209
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

2:23:56.128 --> 2:23:58.087
Well, I did. Uh...

2:23:58.964 --> 2:24:00.923
I came to say hello,
check in on her and...

2:24:01.842 --> 2:24:02.967
(sighs deeply)

2:24:05.846 --> 2:24:07.722
Then I started thinking that sometimes...

2:24:10.517 --> 2:24:12.643
uh, words...

2:24:13.353 --> 2:24:17.189
just... are... are not useful.

2:24:23.238 --> 2:24:25.531
Tools are useful 'cause
you can make stuff with 'em

2:24:25.615 --> 2:24:27.325
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

2:24:28.827 --> 2:24:30.286
Here.

2:24:31.204 --> 2:24:32.330
Thanks.

2:24:41.173 --> 2:24:42.631
Your daddy was, uh...

2:24:43.633 --> 2:24:44.967
(clicks tongue)

2:24:46.219 --> 2:24:47.970
He was your friend.

2:24:54.019 --> 2:24:55.186
Yes, he was.

2:24:56.688 --> 2:24:58.230
Yes, sir.

2:25:03.153 --> 2:25:05.571
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

2:25:10.827 --> 2:25:12.328
MOLLIE: Peter!

2:25:17.209 --> 2:25:19.168
I think I've gotta go help my mum.

2:25:21.546 --> 2:25:23.881
What are you doing here then? Go on.

2:25:24.925 --> 2:25:26.258
PETER: Bye.

2:25:47.572 --> 2:25:49.490
(sobs quietly)

2:26:04.673 --> 2:26:05.840
(sniffles)

2:26:05.924 --> 2:26:07.383
(horn honks)

2:26:09.970 --> 2:26:11.178
(exhales sharply)

2:26:11.263 --> 2:26:13.222
- (keys jingle)
- (engine starts)

2:26:17.894 --> 2:26:19.437
(engine revs)

2:26:28.572 --> 2:26:30.573
(upbeat rock music playing)

2:29:49.606 --> 2:29:52.858
(mid-tempo music playing)

2:31:53.897 --> 2:31:55.522
(instrumental music playing)

2:32:25.512 --> 2:32:27.179
