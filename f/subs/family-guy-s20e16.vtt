Oh, good.
Kids, you're just in time for breakfast.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.958
No time, Mom. The girl I stalk

00:42.042 --> 00:44.169
has field hockey practice at 8:00.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.088
I love a red-cheeked barbarian.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.298
How about you, Meg?

00:48.298 --> 00:51.176
Can't. I'm weirdly the girl he's stalking.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.179
God help me, I love the attention.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.889
Well, it's just you and me, Stewie.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.390
What should we do today?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.976
I don't know, maybe forget
everything that just happened?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.227
All right, there he is.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.021
- Do you have his lunch ready?
- Lunch?

01:03.021 --> 01:06.107
This big boy has his first
whole day of preschool today.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.651
Oh, my God, is it September already?

01:08.735 --> 01:11.321
Wow. So I have the whole day to myself.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.073
Let's see. I...

01:13.073 --> 01:15.658
I guess I've got nothing
to do except create an excuse

01:15.742 --> 01:18.953
to touch the Target cashier lady
I want to run away with.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.539
That'll be $6.11.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.626
Oh, perfect. I have a dime and a penny.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.337
They're right here, in my hand,

01:27.337 --> 01:28.880
for you to take.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.185
We could go to Montana.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.979
I want to, but I can't.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.988
Esperanza, it's time to get back to work.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.076
Lady! Wait!

02:12.882 --> 02:13.675
No!

02:13.675 --> 02:16.261
Cinnamon-skinned Target lady!

02:16.261 --> 02:17.971
No!

02:17.971 --> 02:19.931
Target. Due to lesbian fantasies,

02:20.015 --> 02:21.933
<i>we no longer accept change.</i>

02:25.020 --> 02:27.063
Well, I have the whole day.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.107
I guess I can watch <i>The Office</i> for so long

02:29.107 --> 02:32.193
that Netflix has
to ask if I'm still alive.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.133
Hey, Lois, is everything okay?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.719
Uh, our Netflix says your
Netflix is worried about you.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.012
Is that the delivery guy?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.472
Ooh, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him!

03:08.313 --> 03:11.024
Oh, my God. Oh, Brian, are you okay?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.360
Oh, crap. I-I can't remember

03:13.360 --> 03:15.945
if doggy arms are
supposed to bend that way.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.074
Okay, Bonnie might know if doggy arms

03:19.074 --> 03:21.951
are supposed to bend that way.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.411
Hang on. She's responding.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.330
I can see the little dots in the bubble.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.623
Oh, no, wait, she stopped.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.916
Oh, now she's typing again.

03:27.916 --> 03:28.917
Take me...

03:28.917 --> 03:30.752
Typing. Typing.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.836
Typing.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.088
...to a hospital.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.131
Oh, Bonnie doesn't have a dog.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.889
I spy with my handicapable eye

03:42.889 --> 03:45.600
something for bulk trash day.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.519
Yeah, you know what?
This thing's a piece of junk.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.020
Worked one time.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.523
Peter, you're throwing
- this Ping-
- Pong table out?

03:51.523 --> 03:52.607
Can I have it?

03:52.691 --> 03:53.858
Sure, it's all yours.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.652
Mattress? Mattress?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.278
Anyone throwing away a mattress?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.405
Eh, what size?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.906
I don't know. Van size?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.282
Whatever size that is.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.329
Hello!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.872
Broken arm, huh?

04:07.956 --> 04:08.998
That's no fun.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.126
Hey! Get out of here!

04:11.126 --> 04:13.837
Uh, you didn't give him
the combination to the lock

04:13.837 --> 04:15.422
on your garbage shed, did you?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.048
- No.
- Good.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.301
Anyhorse, that arm looks broken.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.053
We'll have to get you some painkillers.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.722
I'm just gonna open this drawer

04:23.722 --> 04:25.348
that doesn't have the mechanism

04:25.432 --> 04:27.642
that stops it from
pulling all the way out.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.728
Ah! Darn it.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.312
Hey, I heard a crash in here.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.356
I, uh... I'm gonna need that shed password

04:33.440 --> 04:34.774
to throw everything away, though.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.276
Four, two...

04:36.276 --> 04:37.694
Isn't that the same raccoon?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.238
No.
This one actually works here.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.745
Guys, there's something
going on across the street.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.414
Did that cocky jogger
finally get hit by a car?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.708
Nope. I outran them.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.710
<i>Cocky jogger. ♪</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:55.837
Mile 13!

04:55.837 --> 04:59.132
- -Dad, isn't that our Ping-
- Pong table?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.553
I don't know. Let me imagine it

05:03.553 --> 05:05.680
with lots of paint cans on top of it.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.057
Hey, that's ours!

05:10.727 --> 05:12.145
Wow, Cleveland, looks like you got

05:12.145 --> 05:13.938
the most popular place on the block.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.357
You really fixed this thing up.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.358
Can I play winner?

05:16.358 --> 05:18.443
Uh, yeah, there's a line, bub.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.030
The line starts all the way back
in that burning barn.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.575
Hey, no cuts!

05:29.996 --> 05:31.247
Aw, poor Brian.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.291
Have your pain meds kicked in yet?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.919
Ho, yeah.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.253
How does it feel?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.880
Ho, yeah.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.215
Where are you going?

05:40.215 --> 05:41.716
Ho, yeah.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.302
Huh. I want to "ho, yeah."

05:46.471 --> 05:48.973
Maybe just a half of a half, huh?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.396
Ah...

05:54.396 --> 05:56.815
- What? Wh-
- Where am I?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.858
You're on my head, Lois.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.610
Chris Daughtry?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.237
That's right, Lois.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.364
Would you like to glide around on my head

06:04.364 --> 06:05.782
like an air hockey puck?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.075
Forever?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.370
Just until I have to
do a smoke-inside concert

06:10.370 --> 06:11.996
at an Indian casino.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.581
Oh, that must be soon.

06:13.665 --> 06:16.292
Every 45 minutes.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.377
Oh!

06:21.214 --> 06:22.340
Ah...

06:22.424 --> 06:26.386
A thousand bucks a show split six ways.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.478
Hey, Peter's underwear.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.731
You've been through a lot, huh?

06:37.731 --> 06:40.233
I'm gonna fold you nice.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.666
Ah.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.050
Hello. I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.677
What Lois just did isn't possible.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.012
Or is it?

07:09.012 --> 07:12.724
Let's spend an hour
of Fox's money to find out.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.193
Well, it's 3:50.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.361
That's basically 4:00.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.487
I mean, in some cultures,

07:25.487 --> 07:27.739
it's polite to do things
ten minutes early.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.116
You know, if it's good with water,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.160
it'd be even better with wine, huh?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.245
Just like Jesus says.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.503
B-B-Brian, Brian, was that the last pill?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.548
Yes. But that's fine,
'cause my arm's all better.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.300
Oh, so now you're a doctor?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.344
Of letters, from Hofstra, yes.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.554
Yeah, well-well-well-well,
there's nothing I love more

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
than my dog Brian
and I'm not gonna take the chance

07:53.640 --> 07:55.850
that he doesn't have
enough pills just in case.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.269
Lois, I'm good. I don't want
to get hooked on those things.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.815
Who wants to go for a ride in the car?

08:05.902 --> 08:08.822
- Hey! Dr. Griffin!
- Yeah, Hofstra!

08:08.822 --> 08:11.866
<i>Hofstra.
Pets need safety schools, too.</i>

08:18.248 --> 08:20.166
Okay. Time to play another round

08:20.250 --> 08:23.253
of expiration date roulette
with this salami.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.549
God, that's annoying.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.762
No problem.
I can turn on that one radio station

08:32.846 --> 08:34.889
that's just religious Spanish shouting.

08:34.973 --> 08:38.476
<i>¡Jesucristo es el Señor</i>

08:38.560 --> 08:40.603
<i>del mundo!</i>

08:40.687 --> 08:44.107
It's okay. I'm sure that noise
won't make me go insane.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.611
Peter?

08:48.695 --> 08:51.114
How's your new novel coming along?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.929
Don't read that.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.556
It's still very rough.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.227
Okay, if anyone has drugs,

09:21.311 --> 09:23.646
it's high school kids under the bleachers.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.273
Hey, daddy-os.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.650
Anyone want to blast off to Mars?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.735
Uh, what?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.404
Well, what I'm saying is, I'm Lucy.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.907
Where's the sky with diamonds?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.910
Excuse me, ma'am, are you lost?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.120
No, I want pills! Give me pills!

09:39.204 --> 09:40.705
Aren't you kids doing drugs under here?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.791
No, we're picking up trash

09:42.791 --> 09:44.668
and organizing a Black Lives Matter rally.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.503
Ugh! How could you be so selfish?!

09:46.503 --> 09:47.754
Hey, daddy-os...

09:47.754 --> 09:48.963
They don't have drugs!

09:49.047 --> 09:50.799
Later, alligators.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.056
- Oh, Ping-
- Pong, huh? That's cute.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.266
Me, I like American games.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.185
Okay, I'll bite.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.978
- No, I'm just saying Ping-
- Pong's not bad,

10:04.062 --> 10:05.647
but I'll tell you what's better--

10:05.647 --> 10:06.815
foosball.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.817
Isn't it generally agreed that foosball,

10:08.817 --> 10:11.403
much like soccer,
originated in Western Europe?

10:11.403 --> 10:13.405
Isn't it generally agreed
a sphincter says, "What?"

10:13.405 --> 10:15.448
- No, it's not.
- What? Damn it!

10:15.532 --> 10:19.202
Hey, y'all! Come and get
your A&W cream soda floats!

10:19.202 --> 10:20.495
Holy crap!

10:20.495 --> 10:22.706
That's a huge frickin' brand!

10:22.706 --> 10:25.041
Long spoon? Long spoon?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
Long spoon to keep your knuckles dry?

10:28.253 --> 10:30.463
Okay. Thank you so much, Cleveland,

10:30.547 --> 10:33.591
- for taking care of my Ping-
- Pong table for the last few days.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.218
I'll be taking it back now.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.139
Now, Peter, just
because Cleveland had the vision

10:39.139 --> 10:41.558
to see the potential
- in your Ping-
- Pong table you didn't,

10:41.558 --> 10:44.144
that doesn't mean
you have the right to take it back.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.730
- Yeah? Says who?
- Says the landmark case

10:46.730 --> 10:50.066
<i>One Man's Trash v. Another Man's Treasure.</i>

10:59.034 --> 11:00.994
Hard-shell tacos, y'all.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.495
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.581
What's the brand on those shells?

11:04.581 --> 11:05.999
Old El Paso.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.377
Oh, baby. Huge brand.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.300
Damn it, there's got to be
one more pill in here somewhere.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.718
I mean, maybe there's one that got stuck

11:16.718 --> 11:18.720
in a drawer or something.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.388
Okay. Here, Stewie.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.057
Time to get nice and clean in your bath

11:22.057 --> 11:23.475
while Mommy gets on her knees

11:23.475 --> 11:25.560
and Tara Reids around the bathroom.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.812
Uh, there's no water in here.

11:27.896 --> 11:31.399
All right, let's see.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.984
Here it is.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.569
How's the temperature, sweetie?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.071
Of what? The air?

11:36.071 --> 11:38.031
Okay, I just need some water.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.282
Yeah, me, too.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.498
Oh, my God.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.916
That's the last pill.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.461
Oh, damn it, my hand's too big.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.380
It won't fit.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.965
Oh, Stewie,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.760
you know how you
missed your last swim lesson?

11:58.760 --> 12:01.805
Yeah, we could do
a little makeup class, huh?

12:01.805 --> 12:03.723
Wait, what's happening?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:03.807 --> 12:07.686
Well, you know how Teacher Amy

12:07.686 --> 12:09.688
Well, this is like that,
except it's a pill

12:09.688 --> 12:11.189
and it's not okay if you don't get it.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.274
Aah! Damn you!

12:13.358 --> 12:16.277
Come on, come on, you just touched it!

12:16.361 --> 12:18.363
What's all the yelling...?
Oh, my God, Lois,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.407
what are you doing?

12:22.117 --> 12:25.412
First there wasn't enough water,
then there was too much.

12:25.412 --> 12:29.207
I just wanted the pill.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.583
Lois, you need help.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.711
I'm sorry, but there's
only one thing to do.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.421
I have one pill left.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.548
It's in my crate and you may have it.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.219
Brian, I don't see it.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.390
What are you doing?
Let me out of here, Brian.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.101
Help! Somebody help me!

12:48.101 --> 12:51.271
I'd stop, but my VO2 max rate is 70.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.831
I'm sorry, I can't do that, Lois.

You're an addict,
