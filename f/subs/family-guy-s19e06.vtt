I can only flap about
like a motorized tub toy.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.846
Please help me. And hurry.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.058
I'm about to get hit by
the old retired guy doing laps.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.768
Quick! He can't hear me

10:01.851 --> 10:03.937
because there's an investment
commercial playing in his head.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.939
COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER:
What are your retirement goals?

10:06.022 --> 10:07.982
Swimming past a tiny-armed fat guy

10:08.066 --> 10:09.609
flailing in a public pool?

10:09.693 --> 10:12.237
T. Rowe Price.
We've got you covered.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.532
Look at that guy.
He did everything right.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.954
Hey, what you doing?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.457
I... just won a 30-pound bag
of wood chips on eBay.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.459
-What's up with you?
-(chuckles) Listen,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.795
I wanted to talk to you about Bruce.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.213
Isn't he the best?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.923
Uh-huh. Yeah, he's great.

10:32.007 --> 10:35.760
But you haven't noticed
anything different about him?

10:35.844 --> 10:38.555
-Like what?
-Well, I-I don't know
how to talk about this,

10:38.638 --> 10:42.517
but here's a film my father made
me watch when I was your age.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.269
NARRATOR:
Then during lunch,

10:44.352 --> 10:46.688
Ralph showed him
some pornographic pictures.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.523
Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.608
but, well, he was curious.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.069
What Jimmy didn't know
was that Ralph was sick--

10:53.153 --> 10:56.531
a sickness that was not visible
like smallpox,

10:56.614 --> 10:59.034
but no less dangerous and contagious--

10:59.117 --> 11:01.202
a sickness of the mind.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.955
You see, Ralph was a homosexual,

11:04.039 --> 11:06.708
a person who demands
an intimate relationship

11:06.791 --> 11:08.543
with members of their own se...

11:08.626 --> 11:10.503
Is that Earth?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.629
Oh, for Pete's sake,

11:11.713 --> 11:14.799
I am 99% sure Bruce is gay.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.011
What?
Mom, he works part-time at Lush.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.848
It's him and, like, ten girls.
Trust me, guy's a total P-hound.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.391
Listen, I'm just trying to...

11:23.475 --> 11:24.934
Oh, I know what you're trying to do.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.978
Pathetic little Meg is happy for once,

11:27.062 --> 11:28.355
and you just can't take it.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.647
And I get it, okay?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.232
You're in a miserable marriage,

11:31.316 --> 11:33.526
so why would you want
anyone else to be happy?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.153
Meg, that's ridiculous.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.489
Your father and I
love each other very much.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.366
Lois, where's the first aid kit?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.535
I tried to put a Ellio's
in the oven and I burnt my head.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.246
-Top of the closet.
-Oh, that little case?

11:45.330 --> 11:48.083
I've been taking that to work
to look like a businessman.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.918
Hold the elevator.
Hold the elevator.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.712
Sorry.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.631
Can someone push any button, please?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.384
I don't work here, I'm just being silly.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.724
(whoops)
I am throwing rocks tonight.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.184
Mark it, Bruce.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.687
Dang, Meg, you are hot tonight.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.647
And you're not so bad yourself.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.273
(laughs nervously)

12:12.357 --> 12:13.983
(phone ringing, vibrating)

12:16.027 --> 12:18.154
Ugh. My mother is so annoying.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.615
She's got some kind of hair
across her ass about us.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.576
-Oh, no.
-I know.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.912
I told my folks about you and they lit up

12:25.995 --> 12:28.164
-like a Christmas tree.
-Really?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.333
You bet your sugar cookies they did.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.168
They's coming to town tomorrow.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.171
But there's something
I wanted to ask you before that.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.258
Babe, I told you,
I really don't want to sell Herbalife.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.634
We'll give that time,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.262
but this is something
a little more special.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.432
Meg Harvey Oswald Griffin, will you...

12:45.515 --> 12:49.144
Hey, hi.
So, I told you about ten minutes ago

12:49.227 --> 12:50.979
something's wrong with 14.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.605
Yep, somebody's working on it, sir.

Dad, what's going on?

12:54.149 --> 12:56.109

This sucks. I want to go home.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.194
Please. My wife's out of town.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.322
I... I don't know what else to do.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.867
You have to help me.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.245
You have to help me right now.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.997
Should just be another couple minutes.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.999
KID 2:
Dad, Tyson spilled fruit punch on me.

-No need, Mom.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.353
Let me show you just how wrong you were.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.439
Bruce and I are engaged!

13:34.522 --> 13:36.274
-What?
-PETER: Engaged?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.693
No daughter of mine
is getting married at 18.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.488
I forbid it. Forbidden!

13:52.624 --> 13:54.584
Peter, I'm sorry, I'm just not okay

13:54.668 --> 13:57.837
with our daughter marrying
someone who is clearly gay.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.673
You know, you're starting to sound

13:59.756 --> 14:01.341
an awful lot like your own mother.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.051
This isn't gonna be good
for either of them.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.928
Lois, let me ask you something.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.639
What's the best-case scenario
for someone like Meg?

14:07.722 --> 14:11.184
Dying alone in a lighthouse?
Maybe Bruce changed.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.061
And-and either way, Meg's happy for once.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.354
I say we go with it.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.607
It's gonna be all right.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.067
No, it's not gonna be all right.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.276
It's never gonna be all right again

14:20.360 --> 14:21.486
if they go through with this.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.987

14:23.071 --> 14:25.240
Get a hold of yourself, woman.
She's coming downstairs.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.659
Well, there's the bride-to-be.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.661
-Oh, hey, Mom.
-Listen, Meg,

14:29.744 --> 14:31.871
I was hoping we could
put all this behind us.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.623
I'd like that.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.960
That's better.
And I'm sorry for what I said about Bruce.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.422
If you love him,
then your father and I fully support it.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.465
Thanks, Mom.
Speaking of which,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.801
I'm finally gonna meet Bruce's parents.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.636
Would you guys
want to come to dinner with us?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.556

-Oh, thank you, Mom.

Seriously, you got to bring it in.

smile like this in a long time.
