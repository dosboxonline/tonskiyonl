<i>Imagine me and you
I do</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:34.483
<i>I think about you day and night
It's only right</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:38.411
<i>To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight</i>

00:38.497 --> 00:42.958
<i>So happy together</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:46.332
<i>If I should call you up
Invest a dime</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:50.461
<i>And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:54.295
<i>Imagine how the world could be
So very fine</i>

00:54.388 --> 00:58.678
<i>So happy together...</i>

01:02.104 --> 01:03.811
- Honey, wake up.
- No.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.230
Anna, greet the day.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.643
<i>For all my life</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:11.398
<i>Me and you
And you and me</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:14.151
<i>No matter how they toss the dice
It has to be</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:16.153
<i>The only one for me is you
And you for me</i>

01:16.285 --> 01:20.154
Anna, honey, you've gotta wake up.

01:20.581 --> 01:25.747
<i>I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life</i>

01:25.836 --> 01:27.247
<i>When you're with me, baby</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:29.162
That's it.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.594
I have had it!

01:44.062 --> 01:47.476
- Anna, hurry up!
- What? I'm ready.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.612
- Settle on a station, please.
- OK.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.152
I'm gonna get a little stud
right here, OK?

01:57.326 --> 02:00.364
I don't want my maid of honor
looking like a harlot.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.828
Come on, Mom.
Everyone's got one.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.202
Everyone? Harry, everyone has one.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.625
I can't believe you.
You're ruining my life.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.957
You know what?
End of discussion.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.545
Feet down.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.292
- OK, if I can drive.
- Fine. Did you bring your permit?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.381
No, I can't find it.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.430
- You can't find it?
- What did you do with it, troll?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.550
Anna, why do you always blame him
for everything?

02:23.644 --> 02:26.887
- He couldn't find anything in your room.
- Why do you always take his side?

02:27.606 --> 02:29.017
- Anna.
- No, why?

02:29.191 --> 02:30.602
Let's not do this again, please.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.392
And fix your shirt.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.979
- Look, there's Stacey Hinkhouse.
- Joy.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.071
- Hi, Stacey.
- Hi, Mrs. Coleman.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.867
- Congratulations on your big day.
- Thanks, say hi to your mom for me.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.195
- OK, bye!
- OK, bye. Hi, girls!

02:44.331 --> 02:45.913
You never see Stacey anymore.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.082
- How is she?
- Evil. She hates me now.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.578
Why? Would you leave
your brother alone?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.664
See! She always starts it.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.385
Bye, honey! Make good choices.

03:01.848 --> 03:06.138
<i>So get out of my face, don't even try
Ya wanna help me</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:08.971
- She had the same shirt?
- Yeah, but this looks OK, right?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.013
- The style?
- Sure.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.311
- So, it's cool.
- Definitely not.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.190
- Oh, kill me!
- Anna, what?

03:16.321 --> 03:17.812
I can't believe it, it's Jake.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.612
He's gonna think I'm stupid.
I can't even put on a shirt.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.945
You've never even met the guy,
so, guess what, he doesn't care.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.495
- He's not even looking.
- He's not?

03:26.665 --> 03:27.997
He's not look...
He's totally looking.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.457
- I think he's gonna talk to you.
- Shut up.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.137
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

03:43.265 --> 03:47.430
Why would I want a leprechaun
ice sculpture? I'm not even Irish.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.306
Could you hold on a second?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.937
<i>¡Señora, cuidado, cuidado!</i>

04:00.031 --> 04:03.650
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.802
Mr. Bates, I really don't
understand this F.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.670
You completely missed the point
of the book.

04:24.806 --> 04:29.551
It's "1984." How could anyone miss it?
It's a blatant attack on totalitarianism.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.597
About a rigid society, dominated by
one all-powerful ego-tripping dictator.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.728
My grade is final.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.519
Except he had hair.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.899
Anna!

04:52.375 --> 04:53.707
Hello, Anna.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.039
What do you have today?

04:57.214 --> 05:00.082
- Meatloaf.
- Turkey.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.393
Evan, I'm so sorry.
I had some car trouble.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.312
OK, I thought you forgot about me.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.315
I could never forget about you, Evan.
I see you every day.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.187
What about tomorrow?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.610
Is this new? Am I gonna
see you tomorrow?

05:25.784 --> 05:28.572
You're gonna see me tomorrow,
but not next week

05:28.662 --> 05:31.029
because, remember,
I'm going on my honeymoon.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.281
Oh, my God.
You're not coming back.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.866
All my therapists quit on me.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.665
I'm not gonna quit on you.
I'll be available on my cell phone.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.748
I checked, there's no service on
the north side of the island.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.133
- It will be fine.
- OK.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.092
I've had a better week. You're counting
the minutes, aren't you?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.177
No.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.514
- How many minutes are left?
- 54.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.728
This morning was good,
but then I got up.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.363
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:11.903
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

06:11.997 --> 06:14.705
<i>Last call
Now I'm outta time</i>

06:14.791 --> 06:16.623
<i>And I don't got no Valentine</i>

06:16.793 --> 06:18.750
- Yeah!
- All right!

06:20.213 --> 06:23.081
<i>I just need a little therapy</i>

06:23.592 --> 06:27.336
<i>At least that's what they say to me</i>

06:27.679 --> 06:29.420
<i>Hey, ho
Let's go</i>

06:29.514 --> 06:32.473
<i>I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:50.198
Great.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.571
No, absolutely not.
I said no salmon.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.122
No, it has to be halibut.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.575
I don't care about the extra cost.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.748
How much is it?

07:01.880 --> 07:02.961
Hold on one second.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.003
Hello. Hi, Harry.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.636
No, you may not touch the power tools.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.219
Yes, I would consider
the lawn mower to be a power tool.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.259
OK, I'll see you at home.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.720
OK, halibut...

07:19.814 --> 07:23.433
Could you hold on one second?
Hello, Dr. Coleman.

07:23.944 --> 07:28.279
Yes, Elizabeth,
I'll be at the appointment tomorrow.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.315
OK, good.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.985
And Elizabeth,
remember, you are a smart, strong,

07:34.079 --> 07:35.741
beautiful, independent woman

07:35.914 --> 07:38.406
and you don't need a man
to complete you.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.037
Thank you.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.086
Goodbye.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.762
Uh, excuse me.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.933
- Is this yours?
- Thanks.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.024
Fender medium. So, what do you play?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.447
I play my dad's old Telecaster.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.940
Nice.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.111
- Cute shirt.
- Thanks.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.285
You're in a band?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.410
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

08:20.542 --> 08:24.536
You know, we're still stuck
in our garage phase, so...

08:24.629 --> 08:27.713
OK. Well, if you ever
get out of your garage...

08:27.799 --> 08:29.756
- Let me know.
- Yeah, totally.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.876
You can come check me out.
I mean, the band.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.008
I mean I'll be there too,
if you wanna come check...

08:36.057 --> 08:38.549
- I'm Anna.
- Jake.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.184
So, what do you say?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.264
- You want a ride?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.517
Here you go,
you can wear my extra helmet.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.567
Oh, I just realized,
I have to meet my friends.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.148
- They're waiting for me.
- Your mom would kill you.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.322
So dead, and so grounded.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.742
I get it. Moms and motorcycles...

09:03.585 --> 09:07.078
Yeah. So, um, see you around.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.962
Anna.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.250
Listen, you like The Hives?

09:12.802 --> 09:16.386
- They're awesome.
- Look, I've got this import.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.217
- If you want, we could get together...
- Coleman!

09:23.772 --> 09:24.762
One second.

09:27.317 --> 09:31.106
If I were you, I would be thinking
a little less about boys

09:31.196 --> 09:34.610
and a little more
about your honors qualifying exam.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.816
I'm ready for the test, Mr. Bates.

09:36.910 --> 09:41.405
"Prepared" is to "you"
as "not" is to "test".

09:41.915 --> 09:44.248
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.155
What are you doing? Get out of my room!

10:17.325 --> 10:20.238
Help me!

10:24.374 --> 10:26.991
Mommy! Stop, Anna!

10:28.753 --> 10:31.541
- ...on the second verse.
- There she is.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.790
Hey, what happened?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.258
Nothing, just taking care of my brother.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.260
<i>Yeah</i>

10:48.064 --> 10:49.930
<i>Yeah</i>

10:52.110 --> 10:53.897
<i>Get up, get out</i>

10:53.987 --> 10:55.694
<i>Move on, move on
There's no doubt</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:57.646
<i>I'm all wrong
You're right</i>

10:57.740 --> 10:59.072
<i>It's all the same with you</i>

10:59.450 --> 11:00.736
Thank you.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.206
- Mommy, mommy, mommy!
- Come here.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.659
Oh, sweetheart.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.495
Ready? I'm gonna give
a one, two, three...

11:12.589 --> 11:16.003
No. Ready? One, two, three...

11:16.092 --> 11:18.584
Honey, go back inside.
I'll be right there.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.465
Anna!

11:23.516 --> 11:27.135
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

11:27.228 --> 11:30.596
<i>Same old start
Same old end</i>

11:30.690 --> 11:34.058
<i>Turn my head
Turn back again</i>

11:34.194 --> 11:38.063
<i>Same old stuff never ends</i>

11:38.489 --> 11:39.320
<i>Do this...</i>

11:39.616 --> 11:41.733
Hold still, honey.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.490
I promise you, there will be
serious consequences for her.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.196
Hey, Tessie!

11:47.290 --> 11:49.452
Dad, you're early!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.283
- What?
- You're early.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.993
I can't hear...

11:53.171 --> 11:55.288
You're... early.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.249
Hold on, I need my glasses.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.211
- Grandpa!
- Hey, monkey!

12:03.056 --> 12:05.969
What is this?
One of them thongs?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.348
I don't want to know.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.559
What's up?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.806
- Hey, you guys.
- You know these yard apes?

12:14.484 --> 12:15.725
- You're early.
- What?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.059
Glad you could make it.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.733
- I brought an early wedding present.
- What?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.943
- I thought I'd get the author to sign it.
- What?

12:26.079 --> 12:29.413
- I thought I'd ask the author...
- I can't hear you. Hold on.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.997
Come on, let's get out of here.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.834
What do you have under your shirt?
Ryan, could you...

12:33.920 --> 12:37.584
<i>On and on and on and on</i>

12:37.674 --> 12:41.463
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:45.091
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

12:45.181 --> 12:47.264
<i>I wanna shout out</i>

12:47.350 --> 12:50.843
<i>Take me away, away, away</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:57.025
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

13:14.002 --> 13:15.959
- Bummer!
- Not again.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.786
Time's up. It's after six!

13:21.134 --> 13:23.126
Guys, you're gonna spoil your dinner.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.844
You know, this dad thing
could be hard or easy.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.100
Don't let her see you.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.523
Good, now we can hear.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.896
Speak for yourself.
I could use those little notes.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.398
She hates it when I pull the plug,
so get ready for the fireworks.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.991
- Did I say hello?
- I must've missed it.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.364
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.113
Get a room!

13:56.794 --> 13:58.160
Go, go, go!

14:02.759 --> 14:04.842
This is...

14:04.927 --> 14:09.137
- Just one second.
- OK, but you owe me.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.555
Hello.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.724
Yes, this is she.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.937
Oh, really?

14:19.567 --> 14:23.982
OK. Great, thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.406
- What?
- You'll never believe this.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.451
One of the bands dropped out
of the Wango Tango auditions,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.698
- and we are the first alternates.
- Shut up!

14:32.830 --> 14:35.493
That's awesome!

14:35.625 --> 14:39.164
We have to check in at the House
of Blues by 7:00 and we're on at 7:45.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.877
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.249
- Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Friday.
- So?

14:44.342 --> 14:45.628
That's my mom's rehearsal dinner.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.377
Anna, come on,
this is really important.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.630
Don't worry. I'll work it out.
I'll be there.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.182
How can you? Aren't you
the maid of horror or something?

14:54.477 --> 14:56.764
Honor, and it's not the wedding,
it's the rehearsal.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.641
Don't they make a big deal
out of the rehearsal?

14:58.773 --> 15:00.685
Like, all your weird relatives
coming to town?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.440
No, they don't.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.186
There's my Anna-banana.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.692
Come on, give your Grampie-doodle
a big huggie-bug here!

15:07.824 --> 15:10.316
- Come on.
- Grandpa, over here.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.785
- Oh...
- Hey, Gramps.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.415
Don't worry. I'd never let you guys down.
Don't cancel the audition yet, OK?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.293
- I'm gonna talk to my mom.
- All right.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.041
- We're screwed.
- Yep.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.676
Yeah...

15:39.021 --> 15:41.058
"I don't think he knows
I even exist."

15:41.149 --> 15:43.687
"It's so stupid to think about him,
but I can't help it."

15:44.235 --> 15:46.943
Jake, oh, Jake!

15:47.029 --> 15:49.362
Get out of my room!

15:49.490 --> 15:50.947
Get out!

15:51.159 --> 15:54.948
Oh! My... My... Mom!

15:55.663 --> 15:58.326
- She saw it.
- I'm gonna check out those Lakers.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.782
I'm with you.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.374
Mom, did you see
what happened to my...

16:09.218 --> 16:11.084
- I spoke to your principal.
- What?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.762
- Just now, on the phone.
- Where's my door?

16:14.015 --> 16:17.179
- Privacy is a privilege, Anna.
- Where's my door, Mom?

16:17.268 --> 16:20.978
Your door will be returned to you,
Anna, if and when you...

16:21.063 --> 16:24.647
I need my door! Give me that door or...
I will kill myself!

16:24.734 --> 16:26.600
Oh! Can I watch?

16:26.736 --> 16:27.692
- Harry!
- Shut up!

16:30.448 --> 16:32.735
I think we can dispense with the drama.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.861
Maybe you can calmly explain to me
why you were in detention twice today.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.910
OK, I went to detention, but only
because Stacey Hinkhouse

16:41.000 --> 16:42.662
kept hitting me with a volleyball.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.579
When is this conflict with Stacey
Hinkhouse going to end?

16:46.797 --> 16:49.631
Never, because she's an insane,
psycho freak.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.297
You'd know that if you paid
a speck of attention.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.877
- Anna.
- What?

16:54.388 --> 16:56.630
I think you know I pay attention, Anna.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.637
Enough to know that
you got an F in English today.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.887
- Mr. Bates is out to get me.
- Oh, him, too?

17:03.272 --> 17:06.481
Yeah! He looks for ways to torture me.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.856
Like today, the one time Jake
even spoke to me, he totally...

17:09.945 --> 17:12.905
- Who's Jake?
- He's just... nobody.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.701
You say I'm not interested, Anna.
I'm interested. Try me.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.748
OK, he's just this really amazing guy.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.584
- Where'd you meet him?
- Detention, but...

17:26.671 --> 17:29.084
That's promising.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.007
See, why do I even bother
telling you anything?

17:32.093 --> 17:34.460
OK! Who's up for Chinese?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.463
You're ruining my life!

17:37.557 --> 17:41.471
I'm moving out! I'm never coming back
ever, ever, ever again!

17:57.285 --> 17:59.402
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Pei-Pei.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.784
Anna, Harry, you so big now!
What happen?

18:02.873 --> 18:05.866
- Are you happy for your mommy?
- About what?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.793
Oh.
She's such a joker!

18:08.963 --> 18:11.421
Who's catering?
Chinese food good luck.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.999
- It's planned already.
- OK, how 'bout me?

18:14.135 --> 18:16.593
Anna, I pre-ordered the Peking Duck.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.420
Joy!

18:18.514 --> 18:20.722
- I know that's your favorite.
- Whatever.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.716
- The wedding's in two days.
- Think about it, OK?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.848
- OK.
- See you soon. Happy dining.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.225
Your door is underneath the back stairs.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.061
Like I didn't figure that out.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.063
Stop groveling. Let her come to you.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.901
She'd come with a hatchet.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.943
Think I'll go check on that duck.

18:45.082 --> 18:45.993
Anna.

18:47.752 --> 18:51.666
Do you really think your surliness
is the best way to get what you want?

18:56.594 --> 19:00.884
I'm sorry, Mom.
I really have been stressing in school.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.137
I deserved every one
of those trips to detention.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.719
I'm gonna apologize
to Stacey Hinkhouse and Mr. Bates.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.274
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I'll try and do better, Mom.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.859
I'll really, really try.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.904
- What do you want?
- To go to this important audition

19:17.990 --> 19:20.073
tomorrow night that we can never
have again at the House of Blues.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.692
An audition, that's great!

19:21.869 --> 19:24.577
Tomorrow, you mean
after the rehearsal dinner?

19:25.706 --> 19:30.292
- Well, during, but...
- You mean, as instead of?

19:30.878 --> 19:31.959
You mean, technically?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.626
- I need to talk to you right now.
- I think I'm gonna pass on that.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.089
Now!

19:39.095 --> 19:43.305
Anna, I am going to make
one final attempt

19:43.391 --> 19:46.259
to understand what goes on
in your head.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.435
- Don't treat me like a patient.
- What?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.355
All calm and reasonable, and,
"I really want to understand."

19:51.440 --> 19:54.148
I really do want to understand!

19:54.235 --> 19:58.149
Mama, stay out of it, please.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.110
- Mama!
- OK fine.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.154
They're gonna pick one local band
to play at Wango Tango.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.406
We were lucky to even make this cut.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.030
It's a once in a lifetime chance, Mom.
Please.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.031
Why can't I just go? Please.

20:10.167 --> 20:15.037
What I hear is that my special night
means absolutely nothing to you.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.627
I don't even have to ask if my band
means anything to you.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.504
It's clear to us that
you think we're all noise.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.543
Look, I'm a walrus.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.676
- I do not.
- Do, too.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.758
- I let you practice in the garage.
- Mom!

20:29.103 --> 20:32.141
- Anna, stop.
- What?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.393
Let's talk about
what this is really about.

20:34.900 --> 20:39.110
- This is about your dad, isn't it?
- Mom, stop shrinking me.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.815
It's not about dad. It's about
the audition. You're ruining my life!

20:42.992 --> 20:46.986
Enough with the drama.
High school is not that hard.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.492
You couldn't last one day
in my high school.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.290
Actually, I could,
and without getting a detention.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.290
I'm sorry I'm the one thing
in your life that isn't perfect.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.670
- You think my life is perfect?
- I know your life is perfect.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.845
Your perfect job, perfect boyfriend,
perfect patients who worship you...

21:04.930 --> 21:09.425
You need a serious reality-check
if you think my life is perfect.

21:09.560 --> 21:14.021
- Cut me some slack, just this once.
- I'm beyond cutting you slack, Anna.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.182
But you are not going to the audition.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.519
- Yes, I am!
- No, you're not!

21:17.693 --> 21:20.401
- Why not?
- Because I said so.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.354
Cookie?

21:25.326 --> 21:29.115
- This isn't really a good time.
- Now good time.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.795
OK, thank you.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.426
Anna.

21:45.554 --> 21:50.549
For one day, the entirety of our life
is not going to be focused on you.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.475
It's all about Ryan now, isn't it?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.266
Anna!

21:56.357 --> 21:58.440
- Get away.
- Honey...

22:12.414 --> 22:14.155
"A journey soon begins."

22:14.416 --> 22:17.284
"It's prize reflected
in another's eyes."

22:17.461 --> 22:19.578
"When what you see
is what you lack,

22:19.839 --> 22:22.627
"then selfless love
will change you back."

22:23.092 --> 22:24.003
Whatever.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.641
Honey.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.811
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.560
Come on.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.673
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

23:04.758 --> 23:05.748
There was an earthquake.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.168
- No, there wasn't.
- Yes, there was.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.463
- What are they talking about?
- An earthquake.

23:11.599 --> 23:15.138
- An earthquake?
- No, there was no earthquake.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.308
You didn't feel it?

23:16.812 --> 23:20.180
No, I don't think so.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.574
<i>6:45 already.</i>

24:12.660 --> 24:15.198
<i>I didn't get the dry cleaning.</i>

24:15.287 --> 24:19.782
<i>I'll have to do that on the way home.
And call the mechanic, and the florist.</i>

24:21.293 --> 24:23.785
<i>OK, I better get up.</i>

24:23.879 --> 24:24.869
<i>I'd better...</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:30.883
<i>Why am I in Anna's room?</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:34.174
<i>What happened last night?</i>

24:34.306 --> 24:36.889
<i>Did... did I pass out in here?</i>

24:37.893 --> 24:40.931
<i>I have no memory of this.
This isn't mine.</i>

24:43.440 --> 24:44.897
<i>Those aren't mine.</i>

24:45.526 --> 24:47.609
<i>That's not mine.</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:52.071
<i>That's definitely not mine.</i>

25:00.082 --> 25:02.119
- Anna, come here quick.
- What?

25:02.209 --> 25:05.327
- Mom's dead.
- I'm dead.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.091
Come on, hurry.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.844
See, she's not moving.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.800
Oh, my God.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.724
No, wait. It's breathing.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.181
- I'm not dead.
- What?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.228
Uh...

25:28.694 --> 25:31.858
Right, ah... Her chest is moving.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.400
Honey, see?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.195
You called me "honey".

25:36.785 --> 25:39.744
- Right, um...
- Are you sick?

25:40.414 --> 25:44.374
I hope so, or dreaming, or...

25:44.835 --> 25:48.454
Hon... Harry, go get
your own breakfast.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.832
You can eat Anna's cereal... my cereal.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.132
Cool.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.548
Hello.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.762
Hello in there.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.307
Wake up, honey.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.225
Wake up.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.019
Wake up!

26:10.027 --> 26:11.768
That is it.

26:23.791 --> 26:28.536
Could I just have,
like, one minute, please?

26:29.421 --> 26:33.791
Honey, look, I think
something's happened to us.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.712
- What are you?
- It's me. Mom.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.557
- You're not my mother.
- Yes, I am.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.019
- Get away, you clone freak!
- Don't you use that tone with me.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.440
Oh, my God,
you are my mother.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.399
And you're not who you think you are.

27:01.745 --> 27:05.659
- Look at me.
- I know. We seem to be inside...

27:05.791 --> 27:08.534
- I'm old!
- I beg your pardon.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.418
I'm like the Crypt Keeper!

27:11.505 --> 27:12.666
OK, that's enough.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.173
I want my body back.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.090
And I don't want mine?
My wedding's tomorrow.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.300
Oh, my God, my wedding's tomorrow.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.307
I can't marry Ryan! Ew!

27:28.438 --> 27:30.054
OK, OK, OK...

27:30.232 --> 27:33.225
- OK, what?
- I have no idea.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.360
Mom, maybe we should go
to the emergency room.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.276
Oh no, all that'll get us
is a 72-hour lockdown

27:39.408 --> 27:41.695
in the psych ward and a Thorazine drip.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.869
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- OK...

27:45.205 --> 27:46.662
Um...

27:47.040 --> 27:50.659
So, you're in my body
and I'm in your body.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.160
Why don't we, like...

27:52.254 --> 27:54.792
Yes, I see what you're saying.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.546
A jolt. OK, you go over there
and I go over here.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.095
- Now when I say go... Ready?
- Yeah.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.718
Go!

28:05.392 --> 28:08.931
- Hey, Mom...
- Ow...

28:09.104 --> 28:12.597
- Ow. OK, that was stupid.
- Oh.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.689
Harry... Uh,

28:16.778 --> 28:20.112
I was just teaching Mom
some new dance moves.

28:20.574 --> 28:21.940
What do you want, punk?

28:26.538 --> 28:29.497
You cannot talk to him like that.
He thinks you're his mother.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.662
We're going to have to tell him some time.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.118
We're not going to tell him.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.704
We're not going to tell anyone.
They'll think we're crazy.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.425
- Maybe we are crazy.
- I, for one, am not crazy.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.877
I'm merely a grown woman
trapped in my daughter's body.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.966
Oh, God, I am crazy.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.198
Grandpa, could you pass the milk?

29:04.284 --> 29:07.698
OK, Harry's still Harry
and Grandpa's still Grandpa.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.407
- So, it's just us? What did we do wrong?
- I don't know.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.033
Grandpa, pass the milk!

29:15.295 --> 29:18.083
- Grandpa, pass the milk!
- Earthquake!

29:18.298 --> 29:19.630
Earthquake!

29:19.800 --> 29:21.837
Earthquake! House of Chang!

29:22.010 --> 29:26.926
- Nobody felt it but us!
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

29:27.808 --> 29:28.969
Honey!

29:32.396 --> 29:34.979
OK, I'll take it.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.563
I guess you're not that ready yet, huh?

29:40.946 --> 29:41.936
Uh...

29:43.198 --> 29:46.487
Sweetheart, what are you doing here?

29:46.702 --> 29:48.614
I thought you said
you needed a ride to work.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.284
Right, um... Mom.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.411
I guess you better hurry up.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.992
Get a grip. I am not...

30:01.800 --> 30:03.291
Darling...

30:04.970 --> 30:06.802
could you, like, chill for a sec?

30:08.765 --> 30:12.133
Sure, I'll... chill.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.387
- Get going.
- I'll, like, go get your dad.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.889
Alan, that's not our car.

30:18.608 --> 30:21.021
The earthquake,
then Pei-Pei's crazy mother,

30:21.111 --> 30:24.980
- pointing at me and pointing at you.
- What was she mumbling in Chinese?

30:25.115 --> 30:28.608
She did something.
Some strange Asian voodoo.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.073
What are we going to do now?
I can't go to school like this.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.077
You have to.
You're on the verge of suspension, Anna.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.074
And you have
your honors qualifying exam today.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.745
All the more reason to stay home.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.458
I could go and take the exam for you.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.168
I'm sure a high school-level test
would be quite simple for me.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.505
Are you kidding?
You think you can be me?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.723
Of course I can. Watch me.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.553
"Oh, everyone's out to get me.
You're ruining my life!"

30:56.730 --> 31:00.019
It's easy to be you.
I'll suck the fun out of everything.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.605
- I do not suck the fun out of everything.
- Fun-sucker!

31:02.694 --> 31:06.734
This is ridiculous. I will go to school
and you will stay right...

31:07.366 --> 31:08.823
- What?
- Evan.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.156
- Evan? Who's Evan?
- My neediest patient.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.324
I've been seeing him every day
for the past three years.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.947
Oh, bummer.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.000
Maybe just my face would be reassuring.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.918
No. No way. Uh-uh.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.588
I am not baby-sitting
some 40-year-old whack-job.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.961
- What do I say to the freak?
- Nothing.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.757
You are in no way
to give anyone any advice.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.757
That would be unethical. Just listen
attentively, nod occasionally,

31:33.892 --> 31:38.057
and if you must speak, simply say,
"How do you feel about that?"

31:38.355 --> 31:40.142
You're serious?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.770
You really want us to be each other?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.644
Well, we'll get through
this morning as each other,

31:45.779 --> 31:48.522
and then go back to the restaurant
at lunch and get switched back.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.068
Now go get dressed.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.359
Good luck getting dressed
without a door.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.824
Thank you.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.246
- Oh, boy.
- You'll get used to it.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.497
What?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.335
You pierced your navel?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.381
Yeah, I meant
to talk to you about that.

32:10.512 --> 32:14.222
- When did you do this?
- At Maddie's cousin's Sweet 16.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.640
When you get your body back,
it's grounded.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.802
What are you doing?

32:19.271 --> 32:21.513
I don't know why you never wear these.
They're so cute.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.396
Yeah, if you're selling Bibles.
What'd you do to my hair?

32:25.652 --> 32:28.269
Oh, I've been dying to comb
these rats out for months.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.071
Now you can see your pretty face.
What is this?

32:31.199 --> 32:32.781
Oh. Fixed your jeans.

32:32.951 --> 32:37.912
My patients are not going to pay $150
an hour to get therapy from a stripper.

32:38.248 --> 32:40.865
- All right, I'll drab up.
- I'll grunge down.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.579
Go.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.328
What's that?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.006
Ugh!

32:59.686 --> 33:01.348
Feet down.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.932
- Harry, could you settle down, please?
- Bite me.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.309
Do you see what he does
behind your back?

33:09.279 --> 33:12.363
- Mom...
- Excuse me.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.909
While I'm apologizing,
let me just say to the whole car

33:16.995 --> 33:21.285
how truly sorry I am for being
such an insane control-freak all the time.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.578
You're not controlling, Mom.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.036
I'm the one who should be apologizing

33:26.129 --> 33:28.963
for my flagrant disregard
for anyone's feelings but my own.

33:29.299 --> 33:32.667
Well, at least you have
a great sense of style.

33:32.802 --> 33:33.883
- Not like me.
- Enough.

33:34.429 --> 33:38.298
- Ooh, platinum. Cool.
- Don't even think about it.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.972
Am I supposed to follow this?

33:42.604 --> 33:45.187
It's nothing... darling.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.778
One more day.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.236
Yeah, it's great
we're getting married, isn't it?

34:00.330 --> 34:03.494
Even though my husband died.
How quickly I was able to get over it.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.747
Just pull up here. Mom, out of the car.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.217
- If you alienate Ryan in my body...
- I'll be nice.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.168
Don't kiss him.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.882
Mom, I just had breakfast.
That's disgusting.

34:21.141 --> 34:24.931
Nice. OK, here's the number
for a cab company.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.980
- I want you back here at 11:45 sharp.
- All right.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.891
- Do you understand?
- All right.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.726
What is that tone?
Are you using a tone with me?

34:36.032 --> 34:37.364
Oh, my God.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.819
- Uh, can I go?
- What are you so anxious about?

34:40.954 --> 34:42.411
Hey, Anna.

34:43.790 --> 34:44.871
Do you know him?

34:46.251 --> 34:47.367
Um...

34:47.835 --> 34:49.168
Kinda, that's Jake.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.621
- No. No!
- You gotta give him a chance.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.129
That is the last thing I'll give him.
Just look at him.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.386
- You don't even know him.
- I know he's too old for you.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.173
Oh my God, he's coming over.
Say hi back.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.392
- No!
- Say hi or I'll break up with Ryan.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.514
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.268
So...

35:10.567 --> 35:14.231
Oh, um... This is my mother,
Dr. Coleman.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.147
Hi.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.445
- That's a great bike.
- What?

35:24.706 --> 35:27.198
It's not like I've ever been on it.
I'm not allowed.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.665
I mean, I'm allowed because I'm old.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.543
I gotta go.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.424
Bye.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.468
Walk with him.

35:45.769 --> 35:48.307
Harry, do you know who that is?

35:49.022 --> 35:50.934
Anna's got a boyfriend.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.937
K- I-S-S-I-N-G.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.771
OK, where are we going next?
Harry's school?

35:59.449 --> 36:01.111
He can walk from here.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.827
- It's 20 blocks.
- Fresh air'll do you good.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.864
- What about bullies?
- Run fast.

36:07.957 --> 36:11.325
Tess, look, it's no trouble
to drive him.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.746
Whatever.

36:21.638 --> 36:25.757
- Hey. I've got The Hives for you.
- I beg your pardon?

36:26.101 --> 36:28.468
- The CD.
- Oh, yeah, that.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.894
They're coming to town next week.
I was wondering if maybe...

36:31.106 --> 36:34.975
That's a nice thought. I'm sure
with a haircut you'd look presentable,

36:35.151 --> 36:36.983
but I need to focus on schoolwork.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.445
Truth be told,
you're way too old for me.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.983
But thanks anyway, Jason.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.276
It's Jake.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.278
Ugh.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.660
Hello. Good morning.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.825
Good morning. Hi.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.459
Hello.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.293
Stacey, hi, how are you?

36:58.425 --> 37:00.212
Oh, wonderful!

37:02.929 --> 37:04.465
Stacey, what are you doing?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.307
Ow!

37:09.477 --> 37:10.968
Run away!

37:12.772 --> 37:14.354
Are you OK, Anna?

37:14.524 --> 37:17.562
I am appalled that Stacey
would do something like that.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.313
- Yeah, shocker.
- I am going to be calling her mother.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.276
Forget about that. We'll get her later.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.783
- So, we saw you.
- Saw me what?

37:25.910 --> 37:28.243
- With Jake.
- Give us the dirty details.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.120
- Excuse me?
- Did you make a move?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.374
- Is that something I would do?
- It's something you should do.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.455
Oh, no, no, no.

37:35.754 --> 37:39.247
I don't believe in physical contact
with the opposite sex.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.922
At all, ever.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.418
Nothing. And you girls would do well
to follow my example.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.643
- Well...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:00.737 --> 38:03.150
- What?
- Uh, cold sore.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.481
- Where?
- I feel it coming on. A big one.

38:05.575 --> 38:10.036
- I don't care.
- I'm thinking of you, really. You.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.112
OK. OK.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.198
Good thing, I guess.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.292
Need a ride home
or are you gonna pick up the Volvo?

38:19.047 --> 38:23.007
Oh, I will most definitely
be picking up the Volvo.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.678
<i>Hey</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:37.263
<i>Hey</i>

38:38.817 --> 38:40.683
<i>A- ha</i>

38:40.902 --> 38:43.394
<i>What I like about you</i>

38:44.197 --> 38:46.484
<i>You really know how to dance</i>

38:47.408 --> 38:49.525
<i>When you're going up, down
Jump around</i>

38:49.619 --> 38:51.702
<i>- Talk about true romance
- ASSISTANT: Oh!</i>

38:52.205 --> 38:53.491
<i>Yeah</i>

38:53.706 --> 38:56.119
<i>Keep on whispering in my ear</i>

38:56.334 --> 38:59.042
<i>Tell me all the things
that I wanna hear</i>

38:59.170 --> 39:03.335
<i>Cause it's true
That's what I like about you</i>

39:03.424 --> 39:05.416
<i>What I like about you</i>

39:10.598 --> 39:11.509
<i>A- ha</i>

39:16.479 --> 39:19.142
<i>Hey! Ow!</i>

39:19.858 --> 39:22.942
<i>Keep on whispering in my ear</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:25.314
<i>Tell me all the things
that I wanna hear</i>

39:25.405 --> 39:28.694
<i>Cause it's true
That's what I like about you</i>

39:28.825 --> 39:32.068
<i>What I like
That's what I like about you</i>

39:32.161 --> 39:34.369
<i>- Hey, how's it going?
- What I like about, hey</i>

39:34.455 --> 39:37.573
Oh!

40:00.023 --> 40:01.685
Dr. Coleman's office.

40:01.774 --> 40:05.814
<i>This is Dr. Dunn's office. I'm calling
to confirm your root canal appointment.</i>

40:05.945 --> 40:09.404
Root canal? That's not fair.
They're not my teeth.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.402
<i>OK, I'm not sure...</i>

40:11.576 --> 40:15.069
- No, I'm cutting the dentist.
- You mean you're cancelling?

40:15.413 --> 40:19.157
Yeah, cancel. Like I'm gonna take
that bullet, please.

40:23.546 --> 40:27.460
- Evan.
- No, Boris.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.133
Line 27.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.585
- Thanks.
- There you go.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.429
Whoa! She's blind!

40:37.560 --> 40:39.392
This sucks.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.846
- You wanna get that?
- No way.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.977
I'm not answering that thing again.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.234
- Good to see ya.
- OK.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.856
You're here.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.364
Um, yeah. I'm here and you're here.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.621
You look fantastic. Why,
are you cancelling the session?

40:59.749 --> 41:01.490
- No, Kevin.
- Evan!

41:01.668 --> 41:03.830
Evan. Evan.

41:04.504 --> 41:08.248
- So, shall we go in here and do it?
- Are you gonna get that?

41:10.218 --> 41:13.461
- No.
- So, you don't answer your phone.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.639
I told you I wouldn't be able
to call you on your honeymoon,

41:16.724 --> 41:20.468
- but you lied to me. You're a liar.
- Know what? I'll get it.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.145
Yo.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.726
What?

41:26.192 --> 41:28.525
$10,000? For what?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.860
Halibut! Ew!

41:31.155 --> 41:33.818
What kind of caterer are you?

41:33.908 --> 41:35.991
It's disgusting.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.943
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.329
Fine, don't show up.
See if I care.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.208
Yeah, I'm cancelling.

41:44.711 --> 41:46.953
Yeah, well, same to you, dude.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.621
- So, Ethan...
- Evan!

41:49.841 --> 41:52.208
Evan. I knew that.

41:59.851 --> 42:03.310
Bates. I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him before?

42:03.521 --> 42:06.309
Like, every day in this torture chamber.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.265
So, did you talk to your mom?

42:08.401 --> 42:11.235
Today is a lovely day...

42:11.696 --> 42:14.939
for a pop quiz!

42:15.074 --> 42:18.442
All of you should have finished
reading "Hamlet" by now.

42:18.578 --> 42:21.161
I'm going to ask each one of you
one question.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.164
And you will be graded
according to your answer.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.792
Thank God it's "Hamlet".
I was in that play in high...

42:28.963 --> 42:32.252
- I just... I know the play.
- Like, that'll help you.

42:32.633 --> 42:33.965
Mr. Waters.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.635
Describe the character of Hamlet.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.597
Um...

42:41.434 --> 42:45.724
Hamlet... is, uh...
one of the big characters.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.854
I mean, he's Hamlet.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.602
Um...

42:49.734 --> 42:52.693
He's just... boppin' around.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.146
Doesn't know which way's up.

42:57.116 --> 43:00.200
I don't think the guy's got a clue.

43:00.620 --> 43:04.660
You mean to say that he is a man...

43:04.791 --> 43:08.831
- Yeah.
- who couldn't make up his...

43:09.879 --> 43:13.418
- mind.
- Mind. Exactly.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.586
- Very good.
- All right.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.505
- B.
- Yeah.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.639
- Ms. Coleman.
- Yes, Mr. Bates?

43:23.101 --> 43:25.138
What are the central conflicts
in "Hamlet"?

43:26.270 --> 43:30.731
Political, of course, because Claudius
usurped his father's throne.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.566
Oedipal, because of the undercurrents
with his mother.

43:33.653 --> 43:36.441
And then, there's the timeless
question of insanity.

43:36.572 --> 43:40.486
Is he really seeing his father's ghost,
or is he simply mad?

43:41.911 --> 43:45.700
That is seriously... overreaching.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.449
- F.
- F?

43:49.001 --> 43:52.995
F.
Mr. Frenelli. Who is Fortinbras?

43:53.089 --> 43:55.547
So, I started reading
your new book and,

43:55.633 --> 43:58.717
it just makes me feel really depressed.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.634
And how do you feel about that?

44:05.434 --> 44:06.891
Depressed.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.610
And how do you feel about that?

44:26.330 --> 44:28.743
She and her best friend
aren't speaking, Doctor.

44:28.875 --> 44:32.710
In her diary,
she keeps mentioning this boy.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.536
And how do you feel about that?

44:34.630 --> 44:37.122
- Well, I'm worried.
- You read her diaries?

44:37.633 --> 44:39.340
That's gross.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.801
That's bad. Bad Mom award.

44:42.013 --> 44:45.723
But I'm concerned that she
and this boy might be...

44:45.808 --> 44:47.800
I mean, you know...

44:47.894 --> 44:48.884
Stop!

44:49.020 --> 44:51.854
Stop! Nothing is going on
between her and this guy.

44:52.106 --> 44:56.271
If there was, she wouldn't be writing
about it, she'd be out there doing it.

44:56.485 --> 45:00.820
Her best friend probably isn't talking
to her because she likes this guy too.

45:01.282 --> 45:05.071
He probably even flirted with her.
But he secretly likes your daughter.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.406
He hasn't made his move yet
because that wouldn't be cool,

45:07.538 --> 45:10.372
so now her friend is acting
like some psycho freak.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.536
OK?

45:14.128 --> 45:17.621
That's very interesting. I never
would have thought about it that way.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.088
Cool, guess we're done.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.382
- Hey, hold up.
- All right.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.974
Mr. Bates, may I please speak with you?

45:30.061 --> 45:33.350
I think that'd be fairly pointless,
but go ahead.

45:33.522 --> 45:37.015
By what stretch of the imagination...

45:37.151 --> 45:41.942
I mean, like, how could I get an F?
What mistakes did I make?

45:42.073 --> 45:45.692
- Grading is subjective.
- That was a college-level analysis.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.783
You're qualified
to make that assessment?

45:47.870 --> 45:50.362
As a matter of fact,
I most certainly am.

45:50.498 --> 45:53.457
Well, in the words of Hamlet,
"What's done is done."

45:54.919 --> 45:57.707
<i>That's Macbeth,
you know-nothing twi...</i>

45:58.589 --> 46:00.672
Bates! Elton Bates!

46:01.050 --> 46:03.884
- Griffith High School.
- How do you know that?

46:04.053 --> 46:08.548
You asked me, I mean my mom,
to the prom, but she turned you down.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.934
- This is not an appropriate...
- Now you're taking it out on her daughter.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.603
- Aren't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.395
It was a high school dance.
You've got to let it go and move on, man.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.398
If you don't, I'm sure the school board

46:22.530 --> 46:24.817
would love to hear
about your pathetic vendetta

46:24.907 --> 46:26.318
against an innocent student.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.402
By the way, Elton,

46:29.912 --> 46:32.871
she had a boyfriend and you were weird.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.877
That was amazing!
You totally destroyed him.

46:39.005 --> 46:42.248
I don't think Elton Bates
will be giving me trouble anymore.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.628
- So weird about your mom.
- What did she say?

46:44.760 --> 46:46.501
- About what?
- About the audition.

46:46.637 --> 46:48.594
Oh, right, she said no.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.047
What?

46:51.017 --> 46:52.849
Well, it is her rehearsal dinner.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.677
Don't you think
that's rather important, too?

46:55.938 --> 46:59.522
And you told her this chance
would like, never come again?

46:59.734 --> 47:01.350
She sympathizes, but...

47:01.485 --> 47:04.023
Don't give us this, Anna.
She's totally ruining our lives.

47:04.530 --> 47:05.941
You are the culprit.

47:06.157 --> 47:07.773
Your mom has never cared
about our music.

47:08.451 --> 47:12.695
Never cared? Who do you think
paid for all of those guitar lessons?

47:12.788 --> 47:15.371
Did she ever hear a thank you?
No, I don't think so.

47:15.499 --> 47:17.081
Anna, you said it yourself.

47:17.209 --> 47:21.294
Your mom hasn't paid any attention to
you since she started dating that guy.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.164
- That's not true.
- You talk about it enough.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.296
- I do?
- What is up with you today?

47:27.428 --> 47:30.421
You act like you don't care
about this band.

47:30.556 --> 47:34.641
Look, girls... guys. If it were
any other night but tonight...

47:34.727 --> 47:35.683
Whatever, Anna.

47:40.066 --> 47:41.523
God.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.246
- You picked up my car?
- Yeah.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.206
Get out of the car, I'm driving.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.717
Oh, my God.
What have you done to me?

48:08.886 --> 48:11.594
- Do you like it?
- Get out of the car right now!

48:13.099 --> 48:15.182
- Do you have your permit?
- No.

48:21.482 --> 48:25.601
My hair. It's gone. And what is this?
What have you done to my ear?

48:25.694 --> 48:28.402
- Mom, it's an earring.
- Take it out right now.

48:28.489 --> 48:30.856
- No, it looks cool.
- Don't start with me.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.320
Those clothes are going back
first thing tomorrow.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.284
Why? Everyone likes them.
You look great.

48:35.496 --> 48:38.204
- I look like Stevie Nicks.
- Who's he?

48:39.333 --> 48:42.121
- What are you doing with this?
- I'm eating.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.043
- You cannot eat fast food.
- Why not?

48:44.171 --> 48:47.835
Because it will go down your throat
and drop instantly to my thighs.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.466
- Come on...
- Watch the road.

48:52.721 --> 48:55.805
Oh, this food will make you
blow up like a balloon,

48:56.142 --> 48:58.304
but it will do nothing whatsoever to me.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.885
Aw, Mom!

49:02.606 --> 49:05.565
- Oh, God, this is good.
- Mom, that's not fair.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.439
My first French fry in eight years.

49:08.571 --> 49:11.154
I can hear the Hallelujah Chorus.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.945
Road!

49:20.416 --> 49:23.079
Hi! You back so soon.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.412
Hey, sexy new look for you,
Mrs. Coleman. You look hot.

49:26.547 --> 49:28.254
- Two for lunch?
- No, Pei-Pei.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.791
We'd like to speak to you about
something we think happened to us,

49:30.885 --> 49:31.875
at your restaurant.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.256
- Something that sucks!
- Shh, let me handle this.

49:34.346 --> 49:35.382
OK.

49:35.556 --> 49:39.721
When we woke up this morning,
we weren't... ourselves.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.138
Yeah.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.932
Oh. Mama!

49:48.486 --> 49:51.445
Ay, ay, ay!
You come back here!

49:56.076 --> 49:59.285
- Hello. Hello.
- Did you give them the fortune cookie?

50:08.088 --> 50:10.796
- What did she say?
- Oh, she's crazy.

50:21.977 --> 50:23.809
- Jeez!
- Well?

50:24.855 --> 50:27.268
She don't know what
you're talking about. No idea.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.441
OK, let's have lunch.
OK, let's eat.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.897
- You know what we're talking about.
- Let's hit her.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.897
OK, OK, OK.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.276
Uh...

50:36.659 --> 50:39.276
I cannot fix it. Only you can fix it.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.869
When the fortune come true,
then you go back. Not before.

50:42.039 --> 50:45.453
- What fortune?
- From the fortune cookie.

50:45.918 --> 50:47.875
You find the answer in each other.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.080
When the fortune come true,
then you go back, OK?

50:51.173 --> 50:52.709
No big deal.

50:53.342 --> 50:55.834
You mean we're like,
stuck in this suck-fest?

50:55.928 --> 50:59.638
- You're not going to do anything?
- How about 10% off catering?

50:59.723 --> 51:02.090
No, Pei-Pei, I already told you,
we have a caterer.

51:02.184 --> 51:06.394
Uh... actually, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.474
OK, good idea!
How about I do?

51:12.278 --> 51:14.861
- What did that fortune say?
- Like, I remember?

51:14.947 --> 51:17.564
- I don't remember either.
- I hate this!

51:17.700 --> 51:21.865
I don't want to get married at 15!
It's not even legal.

51:22.037 --> 51:24.495
I want my room back.
I want my friends.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.115
I want to eat whatever I want
when I want.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.961
- Mommy.
- I know, sweetie. It's a hard day.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.504
It's OK, we'll get through it.
Sweetie, breathe.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.090
Deep breath.
We'll go home and find the fortune.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.377
Oh!

51:38.679 --> 51:40.966
- My organizer.
- Make it stop.

51:41.056 --> 51:43.389
It's been going off all day.

51:45.394 --> 51:48.102
Parent-teacher conference!
I completely forgot.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.347
You have to be at Harry's school
in 15 minutes.

51:50.482 --> 51:53.725
- No! I hate teachers.
- You have to go. I'll go to your school,

51:53.819 --> 51:56.903
and take your qualifying exam,
and everything will be OK. OK?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.155
- OK, let's go.
- Yeah, but...

52:05.247 --> 52:06.488
Mom?

52:06.582 --> 52:08.244
Yeah, whatever.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.035
Mrs. Coleman.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.418
All right, let's do this thing.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.174
OK. Well...

52:18.260 --> 52:21.753
What can I say about Harry?
He... he is a sweet boy.

52:22.306 --> 52:26.050
But he's having
a little trouble with bullies.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.686
So? That's character-building.

52:29.855 --> 52:32.097
Kid needs to toughen up.
He's kind of a wimp.

52:33.776 --> 52:37.486
- So, that's it? I can go?
- No, not exactly. Uh...

52:38.322 --> 52:42.236
Harry's very bright, but he's having
a problem applying himself,

52:42.409 --> 52:44.776
- particularly in math.
- So, hold him back.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.738
He's short.
He'll fit in, know what I mean?

52:49.625 --> 52:52.959
Um... Well, you know,
he's very good in English.

52:53.128 --> 52:56.212
I had the class write an essay
on who they admire most,

52:56.340 --> 53:00.459
and he wrote a wonderful paper
about your daughter.

53:20.948 --> 53:22.530
So, what'd she say?

53:22.700 --> 53:25.158
She showed me the paper
you wrote about Anna.

53:25.285 --> 53:27.026
- You saw that?
- Mm-hm.

53:27.162 --> 53:30.280
- Don't tell her I like her.
- Why not?

53:30.416 --> 53:32.749
Because we have too much fun fighting.

53:37.631 --> 53:42.126
You know kid, you are way more twisted
than I thought.

53:45.305 --> 53:48.924
- Good try! Loser!
- Oh, man!

53:51.103 --> 53:52.935
Good luck flunking.

53:53.605 --> 53:56.894
Stacey, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

53:58.152 --> 54:02.021
Why this falling out?
We were best friends in sixth grade.

54:02.573 --> 54:06.237
I know I got involved with my music
and you with your cheerleading.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.735
But why does this have to be
World War III?

54:08.871 --> 54:11.614
All those years of trick-or-treating
and sleep-overs.

54:12.374 --> 54:15.037
Don't you remember any of it?
I know I do.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.124
I mean, how do you feel about that?

54:18.213 --> 54:21.172
All right, let's all take our seats
for the test.

54:23.218 --> 54:25.050
Sit with me?

54:25.387 --> 54:28.130
Communication. That's all it takes.

54:29.975 --> 54:32.467
Hey! There you are.

54:33.187 --> 54:34.769
- You again.
- Look at you.

54:35.314 --> 54:38.182
Love the hair.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.858
Got a surprise for you.
You're gonna be happy with me.

54:40.944 --> 54:44.437
- I seriously doubt that.
- Great dress. Sexy.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.898
- Oozing sore!
- I don't see anything.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.994
- Make-up. Great stuff.
- Take it easy, stud.

54:51.079 --> 54:54.447
- Save it for the honeymoon.
- You know what? We have to go anyway.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.750
- No, I have to get that fortune thingy.
- No.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.834
- No time, I've got my sweater on.
- No, I just have to go up...

55:01.965 --> 55:03.797
We have to leave now.
We'll spoil the surprise.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.967
- Watch your step.
- OK, OK.

55:07.095 --> 55:09.462
- Still got your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

55:09.765 --> 55:12.724
All right, relax. Open 'em.

55:13.977 --> 55:17.470
You're on "The Dottie Robertson Show".
They had a last-second cancellation.

55:17.606 --> 55:19.973
You're on. I got you on
The Dottie Robertson Show.

55:20.108 --> 55:21.394
To talk about that book?

55:22.319 --> 55:24.527
- Break a leg, honey!
- I didn't want to say anything because...

55:24.613 --> 55:25.899
We're ready for you now, Dr. Coleman.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.696
I know you get nervous,
but you're gonna be great.

55:27.825 --> 55:28.781
- I'm gonna barf!
- Gonna be great.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.904
- This way.
- Go get 'em.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.323
Watch your step.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.909
- Right this way and...
- I'm really not...

55:35.999 --> 55:38.036
and right there.
There you go. Sorry.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.037
It's OK.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.244
Make-up's gonna come to you, sweetie.

55:42.214 --> 55:45.457
<i>What is this thing?
"Through the Looking Glass."</i>

55:45.634 --> 55:49.969
<i>"Senescence"."Senescence"?
"Se-ne-sen-sy..."</i>

55:50.055 --> 55:51.466
What?

55:54.184 --> 55:57.518
<i>The sum of the areas
of the shaded regions in terms of D</i>

55:57.604 --> 55:59.891
<i>is equal to: A: D squared
times the sum of pi</i>

55:59.982 --> 56:02.440
<i>divided by four minus D divided by two.</i>

56:02.568 --> 56:06.608
<i>B: D squared times the sum of pi cubed
divided by D minus two.</i>

56:06.822 --> 56:11.112
<i>What's pi again? 3 point something.
This is ridiculous!</i>

56:11.201 --> 56:13.944
<i>I've never used pi.
Anna's never gonna use pi.</i>

56:14.079 --> 56:15.786
<i>Why is it called pi anyway?</i>

56:15.956 --> 56:17.322
<i>OK, focus.</i>

56:17.457 --> 56:20.825
<i>Or C: D cubed minus the sum of pi
squared minus D two...</i>

56:20.919 --> 56:22.000
Psst!

56:28.218 --> 56:29.675
Miss Brown, she's copying my test.

56:57.539 --> 57:00.077
- Hey, cheater.
- I did not cheat.

57:00.292 --> 57:02.158
That Stacey Hinkhouse
is a conniving little...

57:02.294 --> 57:03.580
Hey, whatever, it's your business.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.959
I did not cheat.
Don't you smirk at me.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.798
If you're so perfect, then why
are you in detention all the time?

57:09.885 --> 57:12.298
I'm not in detention. I work here.

57:15.724 --> 57:18.808
What would you say if I told you
I could help you finish your test?

57:19.728 --> 57:23.187
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:23.774 --> 57:26.562
My publisher doesn't think
anybody's gonna know

57:26.693 --> 57:28.355
what the word "senescence" means.

57:29.780 --> 57:32.614
- Do you know what it means?
- No, please to sit still.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.904
All right, they keep the tests
in the file room.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.035
We're going through here?

57:42.125 --> 57:44.663
They're so burned out
they won't even notice. Trust me.

58:11.738 --> 58:13.821
All right. Coleman.

58:16.952 --> 58:18.193
Anna Coleman.

58:18.286 --> 58:20.573
My gosh, thank you.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.450
Now, hurry up and finish your test.

58:22.582 --> 58:24.790
You know, you really are something, Jake.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.745
I'll watch the door.

58:30.882 --> 58:33.499
Loved your book.
I actually read this one.

58:35.303 --> 58:36.635
That makes one of us.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.047
Ready, and...

58:39.182 --> 58:41.299
Three, two...

58:42.519 --> 58:45.432
Hi, and welcome back.
We're here with Dr. Tess Coleman,

58:45.522 --> 58:49.766
author of "Through the Looking Glass:
Senescence in Retrograde."

58:49.901 --> 58:52.439
So, Doctor, tell us about your new book.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.407
Well...

59:00.078 --> 59:02.411
I wrote it.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.538
Yes, you did.

59:04.624 --> 59:05.956
But tell us...

59:06.043 --> 59:11.789
what got you interested in the
physical and intellectual exhaustion

59:11.965 --> 59:16.630
that seems to overcome those of us
who are, let's say, no longer 20?

59:19.264 --> 59:22.553
"Senescence", like "senile". Old people!

59:23.101 --> 59:24.683
Got it, got it.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.684
And, let's face it,
we are tired much of the time.

59:29.941 --> 59:33.981
That's why I've been craving caffeine
all day, I thought I was dying.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.474
But you still haven't answered
the fundamental question.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:12.182
Why are we so tired?

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.355
Well...

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:20.027
Of course we're tired
because of our demanding and hectic...

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:27.530
Do you wanna know why adults
are so tired all the time?

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:31.747
Because they spend their time obsessing
about these stupid lame things

01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:34.295
they don't really have to do.
Like cooking.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.581
I mean, have you never
heard of take-out?

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:40.836
And cleaning, let's don't,
and say we did!

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:44.222
And quality time with your kids,

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.549
You know what, quit buggin' 'em!

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.722
Leave 'em alone. They like it.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.437
<i>I don't remember
reading any of this in your book.</i>

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:56.608
<i>Hello!</i>

01:00:56.778 --> 01:01:00.397
<i>It's called reading between the lines.</i>

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.732
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.367
That's my mom.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:06.948
<i>Try listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,</i>

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:09.246
<i>The Vines, The Breeders and,</i>

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:13.451
<i>if you're excited about something, why
do you have to hold it in all the time?</i>

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.254
<i>You know, just scream about it!
OK, do this with me, all right?</i>

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:19.832
<i>Let's just say this cute guy
asks you out.</i>

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:20.791
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.760
<i>Come on, that was pathetic!</i>

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:31.060
<i>You keep all that bottled up,
no wonder you're getting old.</i>

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:34.230
<i>I'm serious. This guy's hot.
What are you gonna do?</i>

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.314
<i>God, your mom's cool.</i>

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:39.728
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.777
Oh, she is dead, worse than dead.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:47.778
She will spend the next year in
a phoneless, dateless, Amish existence.

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.704
I've got to get home.
Gotta get home!

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:57.412
<i>I never knew girls existed like you</i>

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:02.421
<i>She is beautiful, she is beautiful</i>

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.344
<i>The girl is beautiful</i>

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:10.011
Listen, I need you to give me a ride.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.763
I thought your mom
didn't want you on a bike.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:14.145
You know,
you're a little too virtuous, kid.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.014
You know what?
I'm late for my second job.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:19.145
Just give me the ride.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:21.774
I know for a fact
my mother will understand.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.771
You know what, I'm just gonna
be very honest with you.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.698
You seem really different
than the person I thought you were.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.284
I saw what you did to Stacey's test.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.868
I think you're right.
You're too young for me.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.496
But I don't even know why I did that.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:38.040
- It's really not like me, honestly.
- Good luck, Anna.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.299
Come on, they'll let her
retake the test.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.420
That's the first time Tessie's work
hasn't put me to sleep.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.714
I might even read one of those books.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.593
Hey. Excuse me. Is Dr. Coleman
coming out soon?

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:57.221
Dottie had her escorted
from the building 10 minutes ago, sir.

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.314
But she rocks, doesn't she?

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.525
Look, she signed my butt.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.903
- Yes!
- Whoo!

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.705
Can I have a quad shot caramel latte?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.001
Mrs. Coleman?

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.914
Jake... What are you doing here?

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.624
I work here.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:29.090
Hey, I caught the show.
You were... great.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.090
Thanks. How was Anna today?

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.391
I mean, was she nice to you?

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:39.188
She was stressing a little,
but you know how it is with school.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:42.563
OK, cause if she wasn't,
I'd have to punish her.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:45.648
You punish her?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.363
No mom that listens to The Vines
would punish anybody.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.987
- You like The Vines?
- I got the bootlegs.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.535
Shut up!

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.657
Oh, Anna-banana, it's you!

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.826
- Where's Mom?
- She ditched us at the studio.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:04.293
Harry, get down
from the table this instant!

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.840
I'm imitating Mom.
You should've seen her today.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:08.755
She was so cool.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.853
- Ramones.
- Love.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:25.063
- Uh... White Stripes.
- Can't stand 'em.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.983
I know, me neither.
I mean, get a bass player.

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:34.660
I love this song. Am I so lame
that I would love "Baby, One More Time"?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.494
<i>- Not this cover, it's a classic.
- Still believe</i>

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.167
<i>When I'm not with you
I lose my mind</i>

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:46.164
<i>Give me a sign</i>

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:49.379
<i>Hit me, baby, one more time</i>

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.056
<i>How was I supposed to know?</i>

01:04:58.103 --> 01:05:04.191
<i>Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go</i>

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:09.270
- I gotta go.
- What? Don't go.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:12.448
No, I-I have a wedding rehearsal.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:14.483
- Okay, whose?
- Mine.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.489
- Are you serious?
- I wish I wasn't.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:25.085
Hey. Look, you're not really
getting married, are you?

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:29.006
Please, listen, this was so fun
and I'm gonna remember it forever...

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.750
- But you can't just...
- Jake.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.668
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:34.719
I don't know what
this whole thing is...

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.761
I just... I feel like I know you.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:41.932
- I have to go. Really, I just...
- Please.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:46.857
Just please, let me at least
give you a ride.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:50.227
OK.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.922
There you are, you little monster.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:17.554
OK.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:31.022
<i>I see trees of green</i>

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.771
<i>Red roses too</i>

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:37.525
<i>- I see them bloom
- Tess?</i>

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.781
<i>- For me and you
- Tess!</i>

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:43.205
<i>And I say to myself
- Tess!</i>

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:49.082
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.925
Where have you been? You needed
to be dressed a half hour ago.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.227
- No we're not.
- Tell me where you've been, young lady!

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.471
"Young lady"?

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.062
Uh...

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:12.685
Role playing. Her idea.
A new therapeutic technique.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.436
Switching points of view.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.611
If I switch with Harry,
do I have to wear a thong?

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.734
Earthquake! Save me!

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.036
Get back here, you little...

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.280
Anna, where do I even begin?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.787
Could it be your career-killing
TV appearance?

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.493
Your non-stop partying
with my car and wallet?

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:32.079
Or, perhaps,
my body's makeover from hell?

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:35.374
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:39.420
- Yes.
- And get that cheap stud out of my ear.

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:41.551
Mom, he is so awesome.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.675
- Who?
- Jake.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:46.306
Oh, please, Mommy,
can I go out with him? Please?

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.850
Not in Ryan's fiancée's body, you can't.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:51.811
What am I supposed to do
in Ryan's fiancée's body?

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.983
Go to this thing tonight, be you?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.437
OK, that's today.
What about tomorrow, Mom?

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.147
I really, really, really don't want
to get married.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:02.360
I don't think you're all that thrilled
about me getting married either, Anna.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.038
Why?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.791
Why can't we talk about this?

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:10.913
What is it about Ryan
that you don't like?

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.328
He's fine.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.130
But he's not your father.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:18.459
Mom, I really don't want
to talk about this right now.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.671
Time's running out to talk
about it, honey. Please tell me.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:24.389
Mom, do what you want.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.093
Marry the dude,
just don't make me do it, OK?

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.518
Tess!

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.354
Privacy's a privilege, Anna.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.142
- Tess!
- Go!

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:36.651
Yo, what's up?

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.532
You know what?
I'm not really a prying kind of guy.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.031
But just for the heck of it,
I was wondering what you were doing

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.493
on the eve of our wedding

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.956
straddling some guy
on the back of a big, black Harley.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.283
Hello, it was a Ducati.

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:53.786
Tess, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:56.038
Some fantasy you're trying to get out
of your system?

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.169
Because I'd like to know about it now.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:01.669
I just needed a ride.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.386
I... I didn't really even know the guy.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:06.674
I... I didn't know what...

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.517
He's a friend of mine, Ryan.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:15.062
He likes me and my mom
wouldn't let me go out with him,

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:19.064
so I just had to beg her
to check him out for me.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:21.856
And she did.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:26.861
And, she actually came to find
that he's a very together young man.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:29.783
And she approves.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.455
- Really?
- Really.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.457
Snap!

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:43.256
- Uh-huh.
- So, let's do this thingy.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.718
- You mean our wedding rehearsal?
- Yeah, whatever.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.645
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

01:09:57.777 --> 01:10:02.112
<i>Cause I need to know now,
oh, because</i>

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:06.033
<i>My loneliness is killing me</i>

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:12.241
<i>And I, I must confess
I still believe</i>

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:13.582
<i>Still believe</i>

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:14.707
Excuse me.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.417
<i>When I'm not with you
I lose my mind</i>

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:23.589
<i>Give me a sign</i>

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:25.340
<i>Hit me ba...</i>

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.757
- What are you doing?
- Shotgun!

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.093
- I wanna talk to your mom.
- Are you insane?

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.519
- I know I am.
- What are you thinking?

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.890
How can you entertain ideas
about you and a woman her age?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.601
What are you talking about?
She looks great.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.652
Really? Wow.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.897
No! You have to disappear.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.357
I know it's unconventional.

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:50.536
I know nothing can happen.
I'm not stupid, I just...

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:53.159
I wanna know her.
I wanna be able to talk to her.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.037
Do not come near my mother
or her fiancé, do you understand?

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:57.663
Man, I don't understand anything.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.792
For God's sake, Jake, you really need
to find someone your own age.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:08.592
Anna, you're beautiful,
but you're... not her.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:11.264
Stop it! Promise you'll leave
my mother alone.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.886
Anna-banana!

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.983
I'll give you one thing,
he definitely likes you for your mind.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.877
Come on!

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.758
All right, let's do this.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.512
- There we go.
- I'll have what...

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.981
- What you doing?
- Nothing. Did you bring it?

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.399
Here. Can you get away?

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:05.895
I'd love to, it's just I'm meeting
thousands of 100-year-old people.

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:09.816
- Those are Ryan's parents. Hi.
- It doesn't make them any less old.

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:13.695
Ryan, do you think I could borrow
my mother for just one minute?

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:15.995
Sure.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.292
OK, there's got to be some clue here.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:31.341
"A journey soon begins, its prize
reflected in another's eyes..."

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.888
- OK, that was the switch.
- Let me see.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.015
OK, blah, blah, blah...

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:39.220
"lack, then selfless love
will change you back."

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.521
Great, that means we're stuck
like this forever.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.938
Now is not a moment for your negativity.
Let's try to be selfless.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.939
Give me your hands.

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.026
OK, I'm being selfless.
Are you being selfless?

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:55.368
Yeah, I'm being selfless.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.741
You're not doing a very good job
of it because we're still here.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:01.450
Oh right. So now it's my fault.
Why is everything always...

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.877
It's Jake.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:08.290
He must've followed us.
Mom, what are we gonna do?

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.593
Mom? Mom!

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.596
Shh. Don't scream.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:15.798
Just listen to us.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.595
We're half a block away from
the House of Blues.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:20.473
Just tell 'em you're going
to the bathroom, come do the song,

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.312
you'll be back before they know
you've gone.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.856
- I can't.
- I tried to learn your solo and I suck.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.192
- Yeah.
- Two bands have gone, and they blew.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.107
We might have a chance
if you come with us.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:32.026
No. When I say I can't,
you don't know the half of it.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.820
Anna, don't make me do this.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:49.624
What are you doing? If Ryan
sees you here, it'll blow everything.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:52.255
I know, I'm sorry.
It's just...

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.419
- When I look into your eyes...
- Stop it!

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:58.307
Jake, believe me, it is not me
you like, it's Anna.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.430
No, you're the exciting one.
The musical one.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.352
Actually, I learned it all from her.

01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:04.930
I'm tone deaf.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:08.184
- Tess?
- Shh. Don't move!

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.143
Found it!

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:11.398
- Found what?
- My earring.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.902
I found it, I thought I lost it.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.698
Anna's friends decided to crash.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:19.619
You guys?

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.451
Know anything about this?

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:25.492
Well, I think they're trying to get Anna

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.578
to go to an audition
at the House of Blues,

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:31.423
which had to be tonight. But I said no,
she had to stay here.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:34.050
- You're kidding?
- No, that's how it went down.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:37.971
I know it's not important and she's
just a girl in a stupid rock band...

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:41.433
Dr. Coleman, dude, I'm really sorry,

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:43.932
but couldn't we just borrow Anna
for like, 20 minutes?

01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:47.640
We'd never ask you or like,
anybody for anything ever again.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:49.190
I am appalled at you two.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:52.152
- I clearly said...
- Go.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.230
- What?
- Go.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.899
- Ryan...
- What are you still doing here?

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.035
- Go, right now.
- Thank you so much.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.989
I told you he wouldn't
totally ruin your life. Thank you!

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:06.075
Mr. Dude, you rock!

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.372
Thanks, guys.

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:16.718
- Are you mad?
- No.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.639
Do you, like, not want
to get married now?

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:24.683
No.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:28.684
No, I don't, not if you're going
to put me in this role.

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:32.813
- What role?
- The role of insensitive stepfather

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:35.520
who couldn't care less,
or thinks it's a stupid rock band,

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:39.198
or any of the preposterous
things you just said.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:41.777
How can you say I don't care?
I'm not that guy, Tess.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.080
And, if that's who you think I am,
this is never gonna work.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.283
When I fell in love with you,
I knew you came with a history,

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.831
and a family and I respect
the hell out of that.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.625
You've always put the kids first.
That's exactly how it should be.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:54.589
That's how I want it.

01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:59.336
I never pushed Anna because I want her
to like me on her own terms,

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.513
in her own way.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.848
Wow.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.595
- That's very cool.
- Yeah.

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:12.440
- Now, what are you still doing here?
- What do you mean?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:16.482
You should be over there.
That's where you want to be.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.564
Cheering her on,
that's where I want you to be.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.315
- But...
- Go on!

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:23.785
Go. I can hold down the fort
here for 20 minutes.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.913
Wish her luck for me.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.575
OK.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:46.846
- Hold it.
- You're not serious, no.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.017
OK, great.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:51.222
I've got ID for once. Thanks.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:57.645
<i>Well, you're all dressed up
And then you had some place to go</i>

01:16:57.738 --> 01:17:00.446
<i>Yeah, you waited so long</i>

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.445
So, it's a good crowd out there.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.115
Anna, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.663
- I can't do this.
- Since when do you get nervous?

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:12.660
- No, I really, really can't.
- You rock harder than anyone I know.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:15.913
The rocking may be
in short supply tonight, girls.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:19.215
- What do you mean?
- I'm just not myself.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.544
Anna, look, I know you're stressing.
OK, we all are.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.301
And I know that maybe
it won't be brilliant.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.384
But we'll forgive each other. We'll find
some way to laugh about it later.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:31.645
Right now, I just really want us
to take this shot, OK?

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:35.186
- We'll still love you, even if it blows.
- Yeah.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:39.235
OK, I'll try.
I mean, how hard can it be?

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:42.610
Don't forget, we changed
the chord progression in the first verse

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.443
from CCD to CDC.

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:47.326
You play notes?

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:52.074
I mean, I just thought we could play
in the key of rock.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.621
- Yeah. OK, let's fix your hair.
- Yeah, what's with the bun?

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:04.007
- Mrs. Coleman!
- Jake! Stop!

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.678
Look, I knew it,
you're running away from him!

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:09.766
Jake, if you like me at all,
you will just leave me alone.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.969
- Yeah, but...
- Please, no.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:17.228
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:20.652
the next act in the KISS FM
Wango Tango auditions

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:25.073
from right here in Los Angeles,
let's give it up for Pink Slip.

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:37.252
<i>Yeah</i>

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:41.006
<i>Yeah</i>

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:46.761
<i>Get up, get out
Move on, move on, there's no doubt</i>

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.050
Do something!

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.008
<i>...you're right
It's all the same to you</i>

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:54.849
<i>I'm too thin, too fat
You ask why, so why</i>

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:57.773
<i>So why, so why, so why</i>

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.438
<i>On and on and on</i>

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:06.527
<i>On and on and on</i>

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:10.486
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:14.327
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:20.128
<i>I wanna shout out
Take me away, away, away</i>

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:26.461
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:30.840
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:34.426
<i>Same old start
Same old end</i>

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.015
<i>Turn my head I turn back again
Same old...</i>

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:41.433
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this. It was horrifying.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.315
It's OK, I unplugged you.
Just go back out there and fake it.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:45.646
No, I don't even know how to do that.

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:48.482
Come on, Mom, you can't tell me
you never went to a rock concert.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.734
OK, I saw the Stones once.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:53.662
OK, great! Just go out there
and act like Keith.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.238
Keith, right, yeah.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:57.119
- Richards, Mom!
- I knew that.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.039
- Just go act like Keith!
- Act like Keith.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:02.833
- Not the behavior.
- No, just the playing.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:05.878
Now get out there,
your solo's coming!

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:09.928
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:13.674
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:19.601
<i>I wanna shout out
Take me away, away, away</i>

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:25.812
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:52.178
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:55.803
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.555
<i>I wanna shout out</i>

01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:02.264
<i>Take me away, away, away</i>

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:08.733
<i>- Away, away-ay-ay
- JAKE: Whoo! Anna, you rock!</i>

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:12.532
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:16.202
<i>Same old story
Same old end</i>

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:20.032
<i>Turn my head
I turn back again</i>

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:24.377
<i>Same old stuff
Never ends</i>

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:44.105
It's a little early, but I think
you guys are definitely in.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.020
All right!

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.817
- Are we in?
- Yes!

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:52.026
It was terrifying.
I had no idea what it takes.

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:53.652
- The guts.
- Thanks.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.028
It's exciting, your music.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:58.612
- It's not noise?
- Most definitely not noise.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:03.245
Oh, my God. Ryan! Come on.

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:08.254
Anna?

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:19.716
- My first wedding went like this.
- Like what?

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.846
She ran away with the florist,
whole thing went right down the tubes.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.564
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Hmm.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.020
There she is.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.581
Mom, what's wrong?

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:50.129
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.250
Sure, Mom. After what
you just did for me, anything.

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:55.885
It needs to happen now
before all the toasts and speeches.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:56.878
OK.

01:22:57.431 --> 01:23:00.094
Clearly we're not
switching back tonight.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:03.222
I need you to tell Ryan that you need
to postpone the wedding.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.474
- What?
- No, listen...

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:09.516
I can see you're not ready for this.
And I can wait.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:13.775
I was just so happy I wasn't thinking
about what's best for you and Harry.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:18.275
- But, Mom...
- If he loves me like I think he does,

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.411
he'll wait, too. He'll understand.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.906
He'll be very sweet
and gracious about it.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:30.959
But please, just please
let him know that I love him.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:33.376
And be as kind as you possibly can.

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:35.049
For me.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:37.965
OK, Mom.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:42.675
- I know exactly what to say.
- I'll be along in a minute.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.814
Um... You should sit down.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:12.749
Uh, hi.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:14.748
Um...

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:19.006
I guess I'm gonna start the toasts.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:25.308
So, three years ago we had
a really bad thing happen in our family.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:28.849
We lost a father and a husband.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.898
I didn't think we'd ever
be able to get over it.

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:38.318
But then... this guy next to me,

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:41.399
came into the picture.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.619
And everybody could see
I was happy again.

01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:50.833
I was singing in the shower again.
Not well, I might add.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:58.504
But I was still really worried
about my kids, Anna and Harry.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:05.682
Whether they'd be able to...
accept a new man in their life.

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:09.807
And, now I know how Anna feels.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:15.813
And what she feels is that...

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:22.152
No one could ever
take the place of her dad...

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:27.324
because he was a really great dad.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:34.377
But somebody could, um,
be part of a new family.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:40.542
Its own kind of cool, new, little unit.

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:48.641
That for someone as special as Ryan
we would all just make a little room.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:54.355
Anna really wanted her mom
to know that.

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.283
Earthquake!

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:29.802
Yeah!

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:34.888
And I am so psyched to be here.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:41.065
I guess all I'm trying to say is,
Ryan, welcome to our family.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:42.486
To the bride and groom.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:49.486
- What the hell just happened?
- Trust me, you don't want to know.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.226
Thank you for everything.

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:26.656
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.653
What?

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.867
Go. Go!

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:43.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:50.213
Listen, I... feel really stupid.

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:55.385
You know, I... Yesterday was freaky.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:59.189
And, I mean, I see your mom
and I like her.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.983
I mean, not "like her" like her,

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:03.942
but, you know I mean,
I like her as your mom.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.694
Listen, do you think we could just...

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:10.737
rewind this whole thing and start again?

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.661
I'd like that.

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:21.745
<i>So all your words get noticed</i>

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:27.167
You know, I've been thinking
about that kiss.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.343
Kiss?

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:33.385
Remind me again how I did it.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:36.684
In front of your mom?

01:28:36.853 --> 01:28:39.061
It's OK, she owes me.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.808
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:50.319
<i>And I-I-I</i>

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:53.947
<i>I think I'll change my ways</i>

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:08.667
<i>Tomorrow's a brand new day</i>

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.183
Hey, why don't you ask
that girl to dance?

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.557
- No way.
- Come on, go on over there.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.187
Stop bugging me.

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:25.058
Boy, it's true.
Youth is wasted on the young.

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:27.776
You go ask her then, you old fart!

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:29.145
Now, wait a minute.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:31.731
- If I was your age...
- Cookie?

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:35.739
Well, I... Yes, I don't mind if I do.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:39.451
Mama! What are you doing?

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:40.827
Mama!

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:44.206
Grandpa, Harry! No!

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:49.881
OK.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:10.023
<i>You're the kind of friend
Who always bends when I'm broken</i>

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:16.693
<i>Like remember when you took my heart
And put it back together again</i>

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:21.073
<i>I've been wasting time
With clueless guys</i>

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:25.542
<i>But now it's over
Let me tell you why I'm through</i>

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:29.915
<i>I've met someone new
Who's just like you</i>

01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.876
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.882
<i>It's automatic
I'm sure of it</i>

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.882
<i>No lie
So don't even try</i>

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:42.476
<i>To tell me that you're not the guy</i>

01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:45.350
<i>Cause I been waitin' all my life</i>

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:47.849
<i>For someone just like you</i>

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:51.144
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

01:30:51.237 --> 01:30:52.694
<i>You</i>

01:30:57.744 --> 01:31:00.077
<i>You're the kind of guy
Whose hand's in mine</i>

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:03.198
<i>Sends shivers up and down my spine</i>

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:07.118
<i>I want to do to you
What you do to me</i>

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.831
<i>You're the kind of guy
That blows my mind</i>

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:13.465
<i>And now it's my turn</i>

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:17.132
<i>You've been right in front of me</i>

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:21.223
<i>Everything I need
Why didn't I see?</i>

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:24.431
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.480
<i>It's automatic
I'm sure of it</i>

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:30.433
<i>No lie
So don't even try</i>

01:31:30.986 --> 01:31:33.273
<i>To tell me that you're not the guy</i>

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:36.565
<i>Cause I been waiting all my life</i>

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.774
<i>For someone just like you</i>

01:31:39.536 --> 01:31:43.155
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate you</i>

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:09.689
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:12.725
<i>It's automatic
I'm sure of it</i>

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:15.695
<i>No lie
So don't even try</i>

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:18.822
<i>To tell me that
You're not the guy</i>

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.863
<i>Cause I been waiting all my life</i>

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:24.570
<i>For someone just like you</i>

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.957
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate you</i>

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:34.876
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate you</i>

01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:55.397
<i>Imagine me and you
I do</i>

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:58.104
<i>I think about you day and night
It's only right</i>

01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:00.736
<i>To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight</i>

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:03.613
<i>So happy together</i>

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:06.283
<i>If I should call you up
Invest a dime</i>

01:33:06.372 --> 01:33:08.910
<i>And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind</i>

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.583
<i>Imagine how the world could be
So very fine</i>

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:14.787
<i>So happy together</i>

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:18.382
<i>I can't see me
Loving nobody but you</i>

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:20.551
<i>For all my life</i>

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:23.721
<i>When you're with me, baby
The skies'll be blue</i>

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:25.890
<i>For all my life</i>

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:29.264
<i>Me and you
And you and me</i>

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:31.937
<i>No matter how they toss the dice
It has to be</i>

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:34.561
<i>The only one for me is you
And you for me</i>

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:37.769
<i>So happy together</i>

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:40.104

So very fine</i>

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:48.992
<i>So happy together
Yeah, yeah</i>

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:52.200
<i>I can't see me
Loving nobody but you</i>

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.501

<i>For all my life</i>

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.175
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:15.099
<i>Don't you run
Ease my mind</i>

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:20.858
<i>Ease my mind
Easy my mind!</i>

01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:23.940

Loving nobody but you</i>

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:26.116
