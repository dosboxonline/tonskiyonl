Happy Asking Panda!</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.503
<i>Made in China,
Happy Asking Panda has</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:47.088
<i>many questions for you.</i>

00:47.172 --> 00:48.840
<i>What is your favorite color?</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:51.009
<i>What is your parents'
political affiliation?</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.511
<i>What is your approximate
household income?</i>

00:53.595 --> 00:56.681
<i>All of these questions

<i>Order today and it will arrive</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:15.617
<i>for happy American Christmas
and time of wonder.</i>

01:18.453 --> 01:20.455
I must.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.248
Have. That. Toy.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.000
What, are you serious?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.669
Of course I'm serious,
I'm a child

01:25.669 --> 01:27.128
and I just saw a commercial!

01:27.212 --> 01:28.505
Or maybe you don't want me
to have

01:28.505 --> 01:29.881
a happy American Christmas.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.883
Of course I do.
But do you really not

01:31.883 --> 01:33.802
see that you're crassly
manifesting

01:33.802 --> 01:36.596
the very consumerism on
which Christmas is built?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.557
Chris, can you please
put the dog out?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.767
Yes, sir!

01:43.395 --> 01:44.771
Thank you, Chris.

01:44.771 --> 01:45.855
Hey!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.816
It's very cold out here.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.943
Okay, everyone, time to leave
for the traditional

01:49.943 --> 01:51.778
town tree lighting ceremony.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.405
What's happening now?
I can't hear her.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.407
Sweet. Tree lighting.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.617
Guess that means it's showtime.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.160
Wait, what is this?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.537
Oh, nothing.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.871
Just my own tradition

02:01.955 --> 02:03.665
of putting
four dozen hard-boiled eggs

02:03.665 --> 02:06.001
in a Kroger bag and passing
them out at the tree lighting.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.670
Okay, we get it, Meg,
you're dark and different.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.131
Wow, Meg really is
dark and different.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.258
Yeah, they call me
"Meg the Egg."

02:13.258 --> 02:15.260
'Cause of my big bag of eggs.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.262
I hope you guys
don't start calling me that,

02:17.262 --> 02:18.888
but you can if you want to.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.682
Oh, is this
the "Meg the Egg" thing?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.350
Yeah, no one's
on board with that.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.360
Whoa, Quahog!

02:32.444 --> 02:34.237
Whoa, there! Whoa!

02:34.237 --> 02:36.197
Whoa.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.949
Welcome, one and all,

02:38.033 --> 02:40.660
to the annual
tree lighting ceremony.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.370
All right, Meg the Egg!

02:42.454 --> 02:44.456
Huevo me!

02:45.957 --> 02:47.667
Mmm, perfect yolks this year.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.544
Four and a half minutes.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.672
Now, don't you worry, y'all will
have a chance to line up

02:52.756 --> 02:56.092
and meet Santy and let him
know what dry goods you need.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.219
And right here
in front of City Hall,

02:58.303 --> 03:01.097
I'm placing this wooden nativity
scene that I whittled myself

03:01.181 --> 03:03.892
from a beech tree
what was rat-tailed

03:03.892 --> 03:07.937
by lightning in the recent
meteorological electricities.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.443
Oh, great, just what we need.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.695
A religious display
on government property.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.656
Can't believe this is what
my tax dollars are paying for.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.326
Last I heard, you
never paid taxes in your life.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.745
Only 'cause I've never made
enough money! Ha!

03:23.745 --> 03:26.373
Brian, I can laugh
at a lot of things,

03:26.373 --> 03:29.167
but Jesus Christ is
not two of them.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.419
Yeah, come on, Brian,
it's Christmas.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.838
Have an egg.
Enjoy yourself.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.466
Okay, now to light
the Christmas tree

03:36.466 --> 03:38.218
by telling this child's toy

03:38.218 --> 03:40.387
my mother's maiden name.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.972
Abernathy.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.104
Yay!
Very holiday data information!

03:52.148 --> 03:54.067
I guess Santa's
getting ready to rack up

03:54.067 --> 03:56.194
those frequent flyer miles, huh?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.071
Yeah, we all read
your tweets, Joe.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.823
Smash that "like" button.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.242
Hey, check it out, Peter,
it's Ebenezer Pooch.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.246
We should mess with him
by putting only

04:06.246 --> 04:07.997
Christmas songs on the jukebox.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.958
Cleveland, I got just the song.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.586
<i>Life is a highway ♪</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:15.630
<i>I want to ride it... ♪</i>

04:15.714 --> 04:17.257
Wait, what the hell is this?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.968
Only the best
Christmas song ever.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.220
I tell you, no matter
when I hear this baby,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.180
I start smelling pine.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.974
Joe, this is not a holiday song.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.726
He never once
mentions Christmas!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.894
No, it's about Santa.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.396
All night long.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.607
On the highway...
delivering presents.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526
The video takes place
in a field!

04:36.526 --> 04:37.902
In what is clearly summer!

04:37.986 --> 04:39.612
Quagmire,
many parts of the world are

04:39.696 --> 04:41.239
arid during the holy season.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.366
Including where Jesus was born.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.285
Or perhaps
the singer's Australian.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.453
He's not Australian!

04:46.453 --> 04:48.705
He name-checks Vancouver
in the song!

04:48.705 --> 04:51.499
A guy from Australia can't
know where Vancouver is?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.084
Feels kind of racist.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.711
Mm-hmm.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.713
Damn it, Joe! We're supposed
to be annoying Brian!

04:56.713 --> 04:58.173
Not this!

04:58.173 --> 04:59.341
Oh, okay, I get it.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.301
Everybody pile on the one person

05:01.301 --> 05:03.803
who actually sees the truth
about Christmas.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.222
You know, you guys know all--
what this holiday

05:06.306 --> 05:09.434
is all about, right?
It's all about this.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.935
The world's smallest violin?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.270
A scrotal massage?

05:12.354 --> 05:13.772
"Ah, just like
in the old country"?

05:13.772 --> 05:16.274
We're more word people
than gesture people.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.400
No! Money!

05:17.484 --> 05:18.985
It's all about money!

05:19.069 --> 05:21.279
Is Christmas really so awful?

05:21.363 --> 05:24.115
I don't know, I-I just--
I can't stand how everyone buys

05:24.199 --> 05:26.284
into this annual mass hypnosis.

05:26.368 --> 05:30.205
I mean, like, do not even get me
started on Christmas caroling.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.498
No, go ahead. I'm listening.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.791
No, that's-that's what I mean.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.334
Like, do not get me started.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.294
Trust me, you,
you will be here all night.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.296
I've got time. I'm officially
getting you started.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.589
Name one thing.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.840
I mean, where do I start?

05:40.924 --> 05:42.676
The things I have to say

05:42.676 --> 05:45.220
about caroling. It's like,
how long have you got?

05:45.220 --> 05:47.263
I've got all night, no one
to go home to-- let's hear it.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.683
Yeah, okay... well, I mean,
first there's the...

05:49.683 --> 05:51.309
you know, the singing.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.520
You know what, screw you guys!

05:53.520 --> 05:55.355
All right, screw Frosty!

05:55.355 --> 05:56.898
Screw Vince Guaraldi!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.109
Screw both Rankin and Bass!

06:00.527 --> 06:04.197
Well, I'm with him on Rankin,
but, come on, what did Bass do?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.618
Stupid Christmas.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.870
What kind of name is
Blitzen anyway, what is that?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.039
That's like-- that's not
a name... it's a football...

06:13.123 --> 06:15.125
something.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.297
Aah! Son of a bitch!

06:36.521 --> 06:38.690
Oh, crap.
Why couldn't I have hit

06:38.690 --> 06:41.151
the court-ordered menorah
instead?

06:42.485 --> 06:43.945
Thank you!

06:50.952 --> 06:52.871
Aw, crap, this is bad,
this is bad.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.665
After all I said, they-they'll
probably call this a hate crime.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.878
I've just got
to hide the evidence.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.800
Ah, I wish someone was here
to try to take this from me,

07:05.884 --> 07:08.511
'cause I'd be all like...

07:08.595 --> 07:10.722
No way, you! This is mine!

07:13.058 --> 07:15.310
Now where can I hide
an old, banged-up car

07:15.310 --> 07:17.312
where it'll just blend right in?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.450
I knew this would work.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.243
Especially after
that last flight I took.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.788
Spirit Airlines is
now boarding group whatever.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.790
Just start punching
until you're on an airplane.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.048
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

07:45.048 --> 07:47.759
Ho-ho-homeless man

07:47.759 --> 07:49.594
<i>found dead in local alleyway.</i>

07:49.678 --> 07:52.555
<i>But first we're joined
live by Mayor Wild West</i>

07:52.639 --> 07:55.058
<i>outside City Hall,
who reports that the town</i>

07:55.058 --> 07:58.019
<i>nativity scene he personally
whittled has gone missing.</i>

07:58.103 --> 08:00.980
<i>Mayor West, what can you
tell us about the disappearance</i>

08:01.064 --> 08:03.233
<i>and also about
my contested parking ticket,</i>

08:03.233 --> 08:05.819
<i>and I'll remind you the tree
limb was blocking the sign.</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:08.113
<i>That tree was a hardwood,
Mr. Tucker,</i>

08:08.113 --> 08:10.740
<i>and there wouldn't have been
a leaf on it till mid-May.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:12.492
<i>The printing
of the restricted times</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.577
<i>was also faded,
and as to the investigation?</i>

08:14.661 --> 08:17.372
<i>Whoever took that
nativity scene best sleep</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:20.166
<i>with one eye open,
'cause I'm on your trail.</i>

08:20.250 --> 08:22.210
<i>And I'm gonna hunt you down
like the mighty</i>

08:22.210 --> 08:26.339
<i>grizzly hunts a Slim Jim left on
the dashboard of a Ford Taurus.</i>

08:27.590 --> 08:29.884
<i>I regret
that the West has changed.</i>

08:29.968 --> 08:32.512
Ah, now I want a Slim Jim.
Slim Jim, anyone?

08:32.512 --> 08:35.098
Slim Jim? Never google
what's in it? Slim Jim?

08:35.098 --> 08:37.308
That's rather odd.
Who would steal...

08:37.392 --> 08:38.893
a nativity scene?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.816
Want to tell me
what's going on, champ?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.484
What? Nothing.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.737
Brian, I can tell when you're
lying, because your voice always

08:48.737 --> 08:50.530
gets high at the end
of your sentences.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.865
That's nuts,
you don't know what you're

08:51.865 --> 08:53.408
talking about!

08:53.408 --> 08:55.410
Okay, fine!

09:00.123 --> 09:03.251
Yes, it was me. I destroyed
the nativity scene with my car.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.128
But you've got to keep
your mouth shut about this.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.714
I could be in a lot of trouble.
I already hid the evidence.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.090
Did you at least do it right?

09:09.174 --> 09:10.175
You burned all the pieces

09:10.175 --> 09:11.676
and sank your car in a lake?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.428
No, I parked it in the
Spirit Airlines parking lot...

09:13.428 --> 09:15.055
Oh, because they all
drive crappy cars.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
That's smart, that's smart.
Well, not to worry.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.475
You and I will just leave town

09:18.475 --> 09:19.809
and start a new life together.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.102
What? What are you talking...?

09:21.186 --> 09:22.645
Look, we could buy
a house in Cincinnati

09:22.729 --> 09:24.606
for $43,000.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.399
Stewie, I'm not leaving town--
Wait, what, seriously?

09:26.483 --> 09:28.735
Yes, pretty big. Three bedrooms.
Hardwood floors.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.820
For $43,000? That's insane.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.655
- We could just pay that off.
- I know. You could have

09:32.739 --> 09:34.199
that office you've
always wanted and we'd still

09:34.199 --> 09:35.992
have an extra room for the baby.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.370
- What?
- Or-or a craft room.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.413
Oh, crap, Who's that?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.624
Howdy, folks.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.418
Just seeing if I might ask
y'all a few questions.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.295
Hey, you're the man from the TV!

09:47.379 --> 09:50.006
Please come in,
I'm the man from the couch.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.592
Okay, quick, I need an alibi.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.968
Okay, last night
you and I were home

09:54.052 --> 09:56.137
watching <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
all night.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.473
That's actually what I was
doing all last night.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.350
I thought Tom Bergeron
had a great show.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.851
One of his better nights.
The guy's a pro.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
It's Tyra Banks now.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.646
Brian, I can't do this with you.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.272
And what about you, Peter?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.441
I hear you haven't been
brushing your teeth.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.193
- Yes, I have.
- All of 'em?

10:10.193 --> 10:12.320
- Most of 'em.
- Careful there.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.989
The teeth are the doorway
to the body.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.493
Now, then, can I speak to your
dog who hates Christmas?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.954
Ho-ho-ho! Who have we got here?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.498
Can I interest anyone
in a candy cane?

10:23.498 --> 10:25.500
None for me, thanks.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.086
Ho-ho-okay, your loss.
After all,

10:28.086 --> 10:30.880
it is the world's most dangerous
candy. The more you eat it,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.008
the sharper it gets,
but it's worth stabbing

10:33.008 --> 10:35.385
your own mouth for a sweet
that tastes like toothpaste.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.137
I mean, Season's Greetings!

10:37.137 --> 10:39.305
Brian, where were you last night

10:39.389 --> 10:41.641
between 10:00 p.m. and midnight?

10:41.725 --> 10:43.768
Uh, let's see, uh,
food bank till 8:00.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.521
Uh, <i>Love Actually...</i>
again.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.274
And at no time did
I watch Tom Bergeron

10:49.274 --> 10:50.775
on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>
because

10:50.859 --> 10:52.777
that would be impossible.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.114
Hmm, that's very helpful.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.742
Oh, good, 'cause I-I hope
more than anyone the culprit

10:58.742 --> 11:01.369
who took your nativity scene
is brought to justice.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.038
I'm mighty glad to hear that.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.373
Matter of fact, I was thinking
a hound like you'd

11:05.457 --> 11:08.335
be just the thing to help
sniff out some new clues.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.086
- What do you say?
- Uh, yeah.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.047
In-in fact,
you came to the right guy.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.090
I was briefly
McGruff's sidekick.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.592
Ah, that's Jenny.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.011
<i>But that's not Jenny's dad.
No, sir!</i>

11:18.011 --> 11:19.512
If she gets into that car,

11:19.596 --> 11:21.765
that may be the last time
you'll see Jenny.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.142
- Yep!
- I'm McGruff the Crime Dog.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.020
And I'm Sergeant Bark,
because I bark at crime.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.355
See those kids?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.731
<i>Every day in this country,</i>

11:29.731 --> 11:31.900
<i>60 kids disappear.</i>

11:31.900 --> 11:34.027
- Hey, the bikes fell.
- Some run away.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.237
- You want me to get the bikes?
- But a lot are kidnapped by strangers.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.323
- McGruff? McGruff?
- Or even by people they know.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.949
- Do you want me to pick up the...?
- So write to McGruff.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.326
- Oh, you're-you're giving the address.
- And teach your kids

11:41.326 --> 11:42.577
- to protect themselves.
- I'll get the bikes.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.745
Help, uh,

11:43.745 --> 11:44.871
<i>take a bite out of crime.</i>

11:44.871 --> 11:46.581
And don't forget to bark at it.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.049
You know,
I've been thinking, Brian.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.842
Maybe the first thing
we ought to do is

11:57.926 --> 11:59.844
take an inventory
of what's missing.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.805
Could be there's
some clues in that.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.306
Yep, sure. Good thinking.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.392
Ah, you're a big Christmas guy.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.395
Remind me,
what's in a nativity scene?

12:08.395 --> 12:11.231
Nativity scene, sure. Uh, well,
you've got your drummer.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.484
Uh, probably a bassist, too.
Uh, Jesus, of course.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.320
Uh... Mr. Christ?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.989
I'm gonna say Santa,
then also the elves.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.450
Uh, the pig who makes friends
with a spider...

12:22.534 --> 12:24.119
writes, uh, nice things
in its web.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.413
S-S-S-Slater?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.248
Somebody-somebody named Slater?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.458
I think he's
from <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

12:30.542 --> 12:31.960
Ah, I knew it sounded familiar,
but you know who

12:31.960 --> 12:33.336
we should really be looking at?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.755
People in town who don't
even celebrate Christmas.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.133
Like-like... Mort Goldman!

12:38.133 --> 12:39.801
Boo! Boo, Brian!

12:39.801 --> 12:42.053
They've suffered enough. Boo.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.268
"Dear Santa,
thank you in advance

12:48.268 --> 12:50.478
"for bringing me
a Happy Asking Panda.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.689
"I've been a very good boy
this year,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.275
"and while I understand you
'see me when I'm sleeping,'

12:55.275 --> 12:57.610
"I just want to say
that Rupert was the aggressor.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.779
"It may not have seemed that
way, but we had agreed

12:59.863 --> 13:01.656
"ahead of time
on a form of role play

13:01.740 --> 13:04.617
that would probably have seemed
confusing without that context."

13:04.701 --> 13:07.495
We interrupt this program
for breaking news.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.706
<i>Good evening,
I'm holiday replacement</i>

13:09.706 --> 13:12.292
<i>anchor Edgar Chavez,
alone in the studio</i>

13:12.292 --> 13:15.128
<i>and having some trouble
locking down the camera.</i>

13:19.007 --> 13:22.010
<i>We now take you to a live
news conference at City Hall!</i>

13:22.010 --> 13:24.679
Thank you all
for coming tonight.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.389
Uh, I think
the press conferences mics

13:26.473 --> 13:28.016
are still set
at standing height.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.726
<i>I've still not learned who stole</i>

13:29.726 --> 13:32.020
<i>our town's nativity scene.</i>

13:32.020 --> 13:34.230
<i>Easy, Horse, easy.</i>

13:34.314 --> 13:37.108
So until I get some answers,
as mayor,

13:37.192 --> 13:40.445
<i>I'm officially canceling
Christmas in Quahog.</i>

13:40.445 --> 13:42.113
Canceling Christmas?!

13:42.197 --> 13:43.698
Now we'll never know
what's behind

13:43.782 --> 13:46.159
the last box
on the M&M advent calendar!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.619
It's M&M'S, Peter.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.996
- They've all been M&M'S.
- You don't know that!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.458
You ate my whole family,

13:53.458 --> 13:55.585
you fat bastard.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.380
One. More. Day.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.217
Joe? What are you doing here?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.469
Sorry, Peter, I'm on strict
orders from the mayor

14:04.469 --> 14:07.138
to confiscate
all the Christmas stuff in town.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.557
You heard him, Lois.
Hand over the Hallmark Channel.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.185
No Christmas means
no Happy Asking Panda.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.145
Stewie, I'm so sorry.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.606
But you got to understand
the position I'm in.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.236
I'll tell you this, Rupert.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.571
I shall not stand idly by
while our dog

14:23.655 --> 14:25.907
steals my dream
of a Happy Asking Panda.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.454
I may just have to send
a little text to our mayor.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.040
Yes, I did get a new phone case.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.167
It's Malibu Barbie
next to a palm tree.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.586
The man at the mall kiosk
said it was "girlish,"

14:38.670 --> 14:40.588
and I said, "Yeah?
Maybe I think she's hot."

14:40.672 --> 14:42.841
And he went, "Okay," and I went,
"What do you mean by 'Okay'?"

14:42.841 --> 14:44.676
And then he says,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.886
"I just came back from my wife's
oncologist appointment."

14:46.970 --> 14:48.430
And I said, "Oh, no.
What's wrong?" And he said,

14:48.430 --> 14:49.931
"Her melanoma's coming back."

14:50.015 --> 14:51.641
And I said, "I'm so sorry,
but they're making

14:51.725 --> 14:53.518
advancements in treatment
every single day."

14:53.518 --> 14:55.437
And he goes, "I know,
you're right, but still."

14:55.437 --> 14:57.105
And I said, "Just hang
in there," and he says,

14:57.105 --> 14:59.024
"Shoot me your digits,
our story does not

14:59.024 --> 15:01.401
end here," so we're going
out to dinner on Friday.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.778
I love this case.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.325
Sir, as you requested,
I've transcribed

15:09.409 --> 15:12.370
all your text messages
onto pieces of dried cowhide.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.330
These just came in.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.750
"Spirit Airlines parking lit."

15:18.376 --> 15:20.503
"Parking lit."

15:20.587 --> 15:23.173
"Parking lit. Asterisk, lot.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.259
L-O-L."

15:43.485 --> 15:45.904
Looks like we got our man.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.699
And still plenty of time
to pick up Aunt Betty.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.995
Oh, you really didn't have
to do this.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.830
We both know I did.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.299
Brian, is there anything
you want to say

16:06.383 --> 16:09.719
about the Baby Jesus-shaped dent
in the hood of your car?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.346
Oh, come on,
that doesn't prove anything!

16:11.346 --> 16:13.306
That could be any baby
I hit with my car!

16:13.390 --> 16:16.476
He was lying about Tom Bergeron
earlier. He had no idea.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.562
Why don't you open
the trunk for me?

16:22.691 --> 16:25.151
No way! No way!

16:25.235 --> 16:26.903
You didn't even hide
the evidence?!

16:26.903 --> 16:29.864
Brian Griffin,
you're under arrest.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.325
Just for destroying
public property

16:32.409 --> 16:33.827
and fleeing the scene
of the crime?!

16:33.827 --> 16:36.162
Why are we not leading
with drunk driving?

16:36.246 --> 16:38.581
I'm afraid I have
to take you to jail.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.500
Oh, no, not Brian!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.127
Do we get
the Hallmark Channel back?

16:42.127 --> 16:44.087
Jail?! Are you kidding me?!

16:44.087 --> 16:47.090
Wait a minute, you get three
square meals in jail, right?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.217
Well, I can't speak
for the shape,

16:49.217 --> 16:51.386
but the number sounds right.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.599
Griffin, visitor!

16:58.226 --> 16:59.811
Hey, Brian,
sorry about the sling.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.229
I got shot by an M&M.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.106
Anyway, how's Christmas Eve
in jail?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.691
You know what, it's great.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.818
At least it keeps me away
from all the phony joy

17:06.818 --> 17:08.361
and crass commercialism.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.988
Well, it's good
to see you haven't lost

17:09.988 --> 17:11.489
your lack of spirit.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.491
Well, it certainly is
great seeing you, Brian.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.745
Hey, guys, unfortunately

17:16.745 --> 17:18.288
visiting hours end at...

17:18.288 --> 17:19.789
10:14.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.124
Aw! Aw!

17:21.124 --> 17:23.710
It's like we just got here, aw!

17:31.593 --> 17:34.512
Ah, best night's sleep
in a long time.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.931
I should spend Christmas
in jail every year.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.066
Stupid families having
stupid fun times together.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.777
Reminding themselves
their families are...

17:48.777 --> 17:50.904
filled with love.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.994
Huh, looks like Stewie got
that toy he wanted.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.169
A kid and his bear.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.421
What's more innocent than that?

18:12.133 --> 18:14.135
Aw, they got tennis balls
and junk?

18:18.890 --> 18:21.017
I don't even like stupid

18:21.101 --> 18:23.103
new Christmas tennis balls.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.574
<i>O come, all ♪</i>

18:36.658 --> 18:38.868
<i>Ye faithful ♪</i>

18:38.952 --> 18:43.748
<i>Joyful and triumphant ♪</i>

18:43.832 --> 18:46.626
<i>O come ye ♪</i>

18:46.710 --> 18:49.212
- <i>O come ye ♪</i>
- I don't need Christmas.

<i>To Bethlehem ♪</i>

<i>Come and behold Him ♪</i>

19:01.266 --> 19:03.226
Why am I crying?

19:03.226 --> 19:06.771
<i>O come, let us adore... ♪</i>

19:06.855 --> 19:08.606
The "penis" is right,

19:08.690 --> 19:10.400
I do miss my family.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.819
Oh, my God, what have I done?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.988
I've been so blind.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.949
Sure, Christmas is a commercial
holiday largely intended

19:18.033 --> 19:20.702
to prop up a faltering economy,
but it's also about family

19:20.702 --> 19:23.830
and togetherness
and the Hallmark Channel,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.707
which I admit
I watch all the time!

19:25.707 --> 19:27.500
Oh, my God, I love Christmas!

19:32.047 --> 19:33.465
And what happened then?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.175
<i>Well, in prison they say,</i>

19:35.175 --> 19:39.679
<i>Brian's anus grew
three sizes that day.</i>

19:39.763 --> 19:42.182
Brian... you are free to go.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.559
What? What do you mean?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.853
I just wanted you to learn
that while you thought

19:46.853 --> 19:50.482
it was everyone else who'd lost
the true meaning of Christmas,

19:50.482 --> 19:53.443
it was actually you all along.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.531
So why don't you head
outside to your family?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.075
I will.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.786
But first there's something
I've got to do.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.039
Ah?

20:06.039 --> 20:08.166
It's like you killed Him
all over again.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.676
Oh, Brian,
it's good to have you back.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.552
It wasn't Christmas without you.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.137
I'm happy to be back.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.139
And I'm happy
to have my tennis ball.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.185
Meg? Lois?
You got any more passwords?

20:27.185 --> 20:29.813
The panda loves 'em.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.995
The Griffin assets, sir.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.915
