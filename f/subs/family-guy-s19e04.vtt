Chris, now that Mom and Dad are gone,

09:11.676 --> 09:13.053
we should have a rager.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.638
Oh, I get those mostly in the morning.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.265
You and me both, buddy.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.017
Again, an insert shot.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.479
We really had a hard time
syncing our schedules this week.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.817
Ah, this is wonderful, Peter.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.820
It-It's like a honeymoon in CutawayLand,
away from our kids.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
Yep. Next stop, Paris.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.908
Aw, crap, we picked the wrong line.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.242
May I have your name, please?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.869
Robert Loggia.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.120
Can you spell that for me?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.748
Certainly.
That's "Robert Loggia."

09:41.831 --> 09:44.417
"R" as in "Robert Loggia."

09:44.501 --> 09:48.046

it's Robert Loggia."

09:48.129 --> 09:51.716
"B" as in "By God,
that's Robert Loggia."

09:51.800 --> 09:54.219
Oh, God, there are reruns
in CutawayLand.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.638
I remember this one.
It takes a while.

09:56.721 --> 10:01.309
Longer than it took
to get my iPad back from Chris.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.728
What is he watching?

10:03.812 --> 10:06.147
BBC.
Let's see what's going on in England.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.775
Huh, I didn't know there was a BBC 12.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.402

10:22.122 --> 10:24.582

10:32.424 --> 10:34.342

10:34.426 --> 10:35.635

10:35.719 --> 10:38.805
I'd rather be in the pancake ER.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.643
-What do we got?
-It was a bad flip.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.020
He got folded over on himself,

10:45.103 --> 10:46.730
so he's still wet on the other side.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.440
-Was he the first one of the batch?
-He was.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.233
Damn it!
It's always the first one of the batch.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.776
All right, get him in a room

10:51.860 --> 10:53.945
and give him 20 cc's
of Log Cabin negative.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.697
The butter burned,

10:55.780 --> 10:58.033

around the circumference.

to lose his outer crust.

according to a 16-year-old
autistic fan in Akron, Ohio,

18:50.213 --> 18:51.756
"In order for the Griffins to escape

18:51.840 --> 18:54.092
"from a theoretical CutawayLand,
they must first journey

18:54.175 --> 18:56.261
"back to the original Family Guy cutaway

18:56.344 --> 18:58.346
with Adolf Hitler and kill him."

18:58.430 --> 19:00.223
That's it!
We'll kill Hitler

19:00.306 --> 19:02.809
to prevent CutawayLand and nothing else.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.645
But how do we get there?
Our setups aren't working.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.605
Well, this is where
it gets a little complicated.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.400
"In order to return
to the original cutaway,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.652
each family member must..."

19:12.736 --> 19:16.823

where the love of God goes ♪

19:16.906 --> 19:20.910
♪ When the waves
turn the minutes to hours? ♪

19:26.624 --> 19:28.585
(people laughing)

19:30.420 --> 19:31.963
(growls)

19:33.965 --> 19:35.925
Wow, Joe's instructions were perfect.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.011
Well, who's going to kill Hitler?

19:38.094 --> 19:40.638
Peter, I got to admit,
I'm not comfortable with this plan.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.600
Yeah, I know he was evil,
but do we really have the right

19:43.683 --> 19:45.769
to take the life of another human being?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.854
Human being?
It's Hitler.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.691
Wow, the middle-class morality
of Brian Griffin.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.151
Hitler head, yo!

19:53.234 --> 19:56.363
He cried like a bitch when I did it.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.073
Let's get out of here.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.951
We're... we're back.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.870
Meg, you saved us.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.039
Why are all these principals in our house?

20:06.122 --> 20:09.042
(dance music playing)

20:09.125 --> 20:11.378
You don't want all these nuts
roaming the streets.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.797
Gary, another LaCroix over here.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.299
-GARY: Pamplemousse?
-If they have it, yeah.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.640
-(seagulls screeching)
-Peter? Peter, are you okay?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.433
Wh-What?
What's happening?

20:25.517 --> 20:27.811
You've been passed out for 22 minutes,

20:27.894 --> 20:30.522
babbling about cutaways and Hitler.

20:30.605 --> 20:33.191
-We were so worried.
-I wasn't that worried.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.652
Maybe you shouldn't have eaten
those raw oysters.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.238
I-I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's just go home.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.074
All right. Let me take this sweet,
sticky Popsicle paper

20:41.157 --> 20:44.160
to that beach trash can
that has bees on it now.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.334
(buzzing in distance)

20:56.339 --> 20:58.299
-Damn it!
-(bees buzzing)

20:58.383 --> 21:00.010
(wind blowing)
