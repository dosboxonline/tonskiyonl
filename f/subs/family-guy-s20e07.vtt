Where's the hosiery?

00:42.917 --> 00:45.837
Hi. I'm a 15-year-old wild card, and...

00:45.920 --> 00:48.214
Well, let's get you a gun already!

00:48.298 --> 00:50.759
Oh, Peter,
I'm so glad you're finally doing

00:50.842 --> 00:52.719
something positive for your health.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.179
What do you think about this treadmill?

00:54.262 --> 00:55.638
Yeah, this one's good.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.516
Let me ask a salesperson
for help like a complete beta.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.061
Excuse me, sir...
Oh, oh, you're helping someone else.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.270
I'll be with you in one second.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.730
Yeah, no, no. You're busy, I see.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.815
Help him, then help her,
then whoever's after them.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.109
I'll just wait here
and feel the running shirts.

01:09.694 --> 01:10.695
Sir, do you need help?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.405
I'm waiting for Josh.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.118
- What the hell?

01:19.954 --> 01:21.706
Peter, what the hell is that?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.625
It's my new pitching machine, Lois.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.294
And look, it can turn
our car into a silly tank!

01:26.377 --> 01:28.963
Watch me nail Cleveland.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.632
I got one, too, bitch!

01:33.885 --> 01:35.720
All right, Chris, time for your old man

01:35.804 --> 01:37.430
to teach you how to swing a bat.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.141
But I've been playing Little League
since I was seven.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.351
Oh, that's all right.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.311
After all, this is about
father-son bonding

01:43.394 --> 01:44.979
and not about hitting you in the nuts

01:45.063 --> 01:46.689
to get on <i>America's Funniest Home Videos.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:48.858
Wait, why are you
pointing the pitching machine

01:48.942 --> 01:51.027
at my crotch? Aah! Hey!

01:51.111 --> 01:53.321
Come on, Chris. You and me up there at <i>AFV</i>

01:53.404 --> 01:55.448
in boxy, six-button suits.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.535
The kings of 1991, just for one night.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.412
<i>Or will it be "Two Balls One Strike,"</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:04.707
<i>submitted by Peter Griffin
of Quahog, Rhode Island?</i>

02:04.791 --> 02:06.584
<i>And the winner is...</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:08.294
<i>"Fainting Groom,"</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:10.171
<i>sent in by Kevin and Lisa Tarczynski</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:11.840
<i>of Berkley, Michigan.</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:20.849
"...but it turns out,
the real Dianetics was

02:20.932 --> 02:23.560
the friends he made along the way."

02:27.313 --> 02:29.315
Uh-oh.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.775
Stand back.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.153
The pitching machine
is the only plumber we'll need.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.350
And... I'm waking up outside again.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.436
Got to sleep to grow, guys.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.062
Got to sleep to grow.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.235
Oh, thanks for
letting us stay here, Daddy.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.030
We'll be out of your hair
as soon as the house dries out.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.740
You know, Carter,
we don't mean to be a bother.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.116
Why don't we just stay at a hotel,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.409
and you pay for the hotel

03:21.492 --> 03:22.911
and it should be the LEGOLAND hotel?

03:22.994 --> 03:24.370
I'm not giving you money

03:24.454 --> 03:26.456
for almost drowning my
daughter and grandchildren.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.416
Besides, I have to leave town
for a couple days,

03:28.499 --> 03:30.710
and I need someone
I can trust to look after the place.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.462
Where's Babs? Why can't she do it?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.505
I don't know. The ransom note didn't say.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.758
Daddy, I didn't know
you were leaving town.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.843
- Where are you going?
- Ah, just some funeral.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.470
I'll be back in a couple of days.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.055
I left food out for the butlers,

03:42.138 --> 03:44.265
just change their litter
boxes tomorrow if you think of it.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.934
A funeral? Who died?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.602
Just a...
just an old family friend.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.895
Don't worry about it.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.315
Oh, a family friend?
Was it someone I knew?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.400
All right, look,
I didn't want to say anything,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.070
but it was Meredith, your old nanny.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.031
Meredith?
Oh, I loved that woman.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.158
I was so sad when she quit.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.327
Wow, Lois, you were lucky to have a nanny.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.246
My mom just left me with a radio

04:06.329 --> 04:08.498
possessed by the former owner of our home.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.166
Can I have a snack?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.503
<i>RASPY VOICE
You're sitting where I died.</i>

04:13.586 --> 04:15.463
Why are you even going, Daddy?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.966
People always want
the richest person they ever worked for

04:18.049 --> 04:19.425
to attend their funeral.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.135
They'll be, like,
"Oh, my God, a rich person!

04:21.219 --> 04:23.346
I guess it's okay
he's talking on his phone."

04:23.429 --> 04:25.598
Well, I can't miss Meredith's funeral.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.183
Yeah, I'd better go, too.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.601
But I need you to watch the house!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.645
Oh, Peter and the kids
are more than capable

04:30.728 --> 04:32.021
of watching the house.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.606
Kids?
They're staying?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.942
- But they love funerals!
- Peter, enough.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.735
Daddy, I'm coming with you.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.071
Fine. Ass, gas, or grass?

04:40.154 --> 04:42.907
- No one rides free.
- I guess... gas?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.243
That's what all the prudes say.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.373
Did you know this house is so large

04:50.456 --> 04:52.000
there's a 12-second echo?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.459
What are you talking about?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.586
The acoustics are such that
it takes the human voice

04:55.670 --> 04:57.880
12 seconds to bounce back as an echo.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.757
That's ridiculous.
Not even the Grand Canyon has a...

04:59.841 --> 05:01.551
Did you know this house is so large

05:01.634 --> 05:03.052
there's a 12-second echo?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.013
- Ridiculous, huh?
- Okay, I'm hearing it now.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.723
- Well, next time, maybe don't doubt me

05:06.806 --> 05:08.308
when I tell you the acoustics are such

05:08.391 --> 05:10.977
that it takes 12 seconds
for the human voice to travel.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.062
- I think we should hang
some blankets in the hallway.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.231
Ridiculous, huh?
Okay, I'm hearing it now.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.858
- Guys, I have a great idea.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.403
That's weird.
That fart was from yesterday.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.071
Great idea, Peter!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.490
Listen, I was thinking,
what if we make some extra cash

05:24.574 --> 05:26.492
by turning this place into a hotel?

05:26.576 --> 05:27.994
Great idea, Peter!

05:28.077 --> 05:29.287
Awesome!
We're all in!

05:29.370 --> 05:31.581
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go apologize

05:31.664 --> 05:34.334
to the hotel towels
for what's about to happen to 'em.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.420
Men, tonight you will
have one last night of peace.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.838
I won't lie to you,

05:38.921 --> 05:41.424
a hotel guest has no regard for your life.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.551
That means some of you
will not be coming back.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.346
Those who do
will never be one color again.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.889
Now,

05:47.972 --> 05:49.515
Anderson, you're late-night vomit.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.100
Russo, you'll be in the ladies' room.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.977
- Ooh!

05:53.061 --> 05:54.687
All right, knock it off, at ease.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.814
Edwards, you're
gonna be folded into a monkey

05:56.898 --> 05:58.483
at the foot of the bed,
and then on.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.318
Look at Edwards, he's into it!

06:00.401 --> 06:03.071
- Ooh!
- At ease!

06:09.827 --> 06:12.789
Well, it'll be nice to have
a little road trip together.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.041
Yeah, we never
had a lot of daddy-daughter time

06:15.124 --> 06:17.251
when I was young.
You were always so busy.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.961
Not now, kitten.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.047
Oh, look!

06:21.130 --> 06:24.384
That's just like the pond
Meredith used to take me to.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.180
I miss her so much.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.141
Yeah, I could always talk to her
when I was having a hard time.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.270
Lois, what's wrong?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.940
All the kids at school
said I'm <i>MADtv</i> funny

06:39.023 --> 06:40.817
and not <i>SNL</i> funny.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.653
Oh, Lois, kids can be so mean.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.405
Have you ever heard the story

06:45.488 --> 06:47.865
- of "The Ugly Duckling?"
- No.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.493
Well, there once was a young duckling

06:50.576 --> 06:53.496
who had a hard time fitting in,
just like you.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.290
And one day,
that duckling went off to college

06:56.374 --> 06:58.960
and created a website to rate women.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.379
Then he made $100 billion

07:01.462 --> 07:04.090
and mined user data to rig an election.

07:04.173 --> 07:08.344
Wow! So am I also gonna
be a billionaire making websites?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.639
No, but you'll use his
site to post pictures of wine

07:11.722 --> 07:14.767
and passive-aggressively
body-shame other moms.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.441
All right, for this
hotel operation to work,

07:21.524 --> 07:23.443
we all got to pull our weight around here.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.028
Chris, you'll be
the affable but dim bellhop.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.406
When you say,
"Help those people with their bags,"

07:28.489 --> 07:30.575
I'll ask, "How high?"

07:30.658 --> 07:31.993
Brian, you'll tend the bar

07:32.076 --> 07:34.162
and dole out snappy tidbits of advice.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.038
All right! Stop by Brian's Bar

07:36.122 --> 07:38.499
for some drinks, thinks and winks.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.710
We can... we-we can pitch on it.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.545
Uh, Meg, you'll handle
all the dish washing,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.464
floor scrubbing, laundry,
and anything else

07:44.547 --> 07:46.424
that involves breathing in chemicals.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.676
And I'll be the concierge,
astutely learning

07:48.759 --> 07:50.887
everything there is to know
about our guests.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.722
That will be my one task.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.849
Well, that and looking out for Dunstons.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.268
- What?
- Dunstons. They'll check in.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.187
They'll check right in.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.107
Ah, and here come our guests now!

08:09.614 --> 08:11.657
<i>First to arrive is Tom Tucker,</i>

08:11.741 --> 08:13.993
<i>here to celebrate the anniversary
of his divorce</i>

08:14.076 --> 08:15.745
<i>with his annual bender.</i>

08:15.828 --> 08:17.914
<i>Doctor Hartman and his overbearing mother.</i>

08:17.997 --> 08:19.207
<i>They never travel apart.</i>

08:19.290 --> 08:20.708
<i>If he could just meet the right woman,</i>

08:20.791 --> 08:23.336
<i>he'd find the independence he needs.</i>

08:23.419 --> 08:26.422
<i>Ah, Principal Shepherd, newly single.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:28.508
<i>Lost half the school in the divorce.</i>

08:30.551 --> 08:33.471
<i>The Librarian, never married.</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.139
<i>Adult Disney woman.</i>

08:35.223 --> 08:36.933
<i>First kiss was with a boy at theater camp</i>

08:37.016 --> 08:39.310
<i>who would one day
get beaten up by David Hyde Pierce</i>

08:39.393 --> 08:41.437
<i>for being too fancy.</i>

08:41.521 --> 08:43.564
I say, Brian, do you know
what these guests need?

08:43.648 --> 08:45.441
First to arrive is Tom Tucker,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.527
here to celebrate
the anniversary of his divorce...

08:47.610 --> 08:49.278
Damn it, I guess the blanket fell down.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.863
Well, I've got 12 seconds.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.323
What these guests need
is someone to arrange

08:52.406 --> 08:53.991
a little romance in their lives.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.785
And I'm the perfect man for the job.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.329
After all, I do
all of Kevin Spacey's matchmaking.

08:58.412 --> 09:02.291
So, you're not interested
in having sex with Kevin Spacey?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.794
Oh, good, Kevin's going to love that.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.049
Hey, you know anything about podcasts?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.842
I've been getting into podcasts.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.554
That's great!
I love podcasts.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.222
Which ones are you listening to?

09:16.305 --> 09:18.599
I really like this one called <i>Cereal.</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:23.187
<i>That was corn flakes.</i>

09:23.271 --> 09:24.814
<i>Or was it?</i>

09:24.897 --> 09:26.816
<i>The answer at the bottom of the bowl</i>

09:26.899 --> 09:28.734
<i>isn't always what you expect.</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:30.903
<i>I'm Sarah Koenig, and this...</i>

09:30.987 --> 09:34.824
<i>-...is</i> Cereal.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.370
Dad! Dad!

09:39.453 --> 09:41.664
I-I think I mixed up Mayor West's bags

09:41.747 --> 09:43.249
with Bruce and Jeffrey's!

09:43.332 --> 09:44.834
Leather chaps.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.919
Saddle. Bullwhip.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.589
Rope.
Sheriff's badges.

09:49.672 --> 09:54.135
Saddlebags. Saddle soap. Fancy boots.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.928
- Yep, this is ours.
- Yep, this is mine.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.476
All right, Brian, I've devised a way

10:02.560 --> 10:05.062
to get the Librarian
and Doctor Hartman together.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.564
You see, I've prepared a batch

10:06.647 --> 10:08.899
of Martha Stewart's chokiest scones.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.527
So when the Librarian eats one,
she'll start choking,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.446
and Doctor Hartman over there
will save her

10:13.529 --> 10:14.780
with the Heimlich maneuver.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.491
Here she comes!

10:19.118 --> 10:21.037
Oh, these are going to go

10:21.120 --> 10:23.205
straight to my thighs.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.000
Now if only I could
find a man to do the same.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.545
Oh.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.923
Ooh, these are a little...

10:33.007 --> 10:35.092
These are a little dry.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.100
Okay, remain calm.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.519
I've done this before.
Stop, drop and roll.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.649
N-No, wait. No, wait.
I know this.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.400
Okay, remember your medical training.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.445
"If a patient chokes on food,
do the tummy-squeezy move."

10:54.528 --> 10:55.446
Yep, that-that-that's it!

11:01.327 --> 11:03.913
You-you saved my life!

11:03.996 --> 11:06.540
Oh, how can I ever repay you?

11:09.418 --> 11:10.753
Money?

11:10.836 --> 11:13.923
May I have your attention, please?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.342
I believe you dropped this.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.846
The blueberries are still intact.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.516
Shame to let something so sweet
go to waste.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.935
Oh!
Thank you, sir.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.436
Uh-oh, Brian, looks like we've got

11:27.520 --> 11:29.605
a love triangle on our hands.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.524
I'll treasure this forever.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.110
Well, don't wait too long.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.530
It'll liquefy from the enzymes
in your saliva.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.039
Okay, last load.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.333
Chris, will you help me fold these sheets?

11:49.417 --> 11:52.169
- Sure, sounds easy.
- They're fitted.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.376
All right, I got to find a bathroom

12:32.460 --> 12:34.962
because that's mostly
what life is after 60.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.389
Oh. Excuse me.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.349
Oh, no, it's my fault, really.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.686
I have a brain thing
where I go blind every 45 seconds.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.731
Hi, I'm Jacqueline.
I'm Meredith's sister.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.609
Really?
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

12:56.692 --> 13:00.237
I'm Lois.
I-I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.407
Meredith was my nanny a long time ago.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.992
Oh, is that right?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.161
Oh, that... well,
that's so nice of you to make the trip.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.331
You see, Meredith-- Dark, darkness,

13:10.414 --> 13:12.917
darkness, just ride it out.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.919
And... we're back!

13:15.002 --> 13:17.296
Meredith loved her time as a nanny.

13:17.379 --> 13:21.675
It's a shame she had
to give it up after the affair.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.677
Affair?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.347
I know.
We try not to talk about it.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.849
Some rich guy in Rhode Island.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.602
They were seeing each other,
but then his wife found out

13:31.685 --> 13:33.479
and forced him to fire her.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.442
So <i>that's</i> what happened.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.110
Tragic, isn't it?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.655
She had nowhere to go,
so she came back here

13:42.738 --> 13:45.574
to our childhood home of ThreeStatesAway.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.368
I don't believe it.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.954
I don't believe the Earth
is round, so that's me.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.748
Oh, excuse me,
the funeral director is here.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.084
I'm trying to avoid paying him.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.629
Daddy and Meredith had an affair?

13:58.712 --> 14:00.381
That's why she left me!

14:00.464 --> 14:01.757
Oh, this is horrible.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.926
- I have to call my husband.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.095
<i>Pewterschmidt Hotel, don't tell Lois.</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:08.097
- Peter?!
<i>-I'll transfer you.</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:10.057
<i></i>

14:10.140 --> 14:12.434
<i>The Spa at Pewterschmidt Hotel,
don't tell Mom.</i>

14:12.518 --> 14:14.520
- Chris?!
<i>-I'll transfer you.</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:17.731
<i></i>

14:17.815 --> 14:20.192
<i>Pewterschmidt Hotel laundry.</i>
- Meg?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.736
<i>-Mom?</i>
- Yeah, I'll transfer you.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.828
Daddy, you had an affair with Meredith?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.329
How could you?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.248
Lois, honey, you don't understand.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.041
The horn part in "Sussudio"

14:36.125 --> 14:38.627
gave your mother a headache
that lasted five years.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.837
What was I supposed to do?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.422
Yeah, I don't want to hear it.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.716
Do you have any idea
what that woman meant to me?

14:43.799 --> 14:47.386
While you were off working
or golfing or God knows what,

14:47.469 --> 14:49.305
she was at my piano recitals

14:49.388 --> 14:51.640
or-or teaching me how to tie my shoes.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.642
She was the only person in that house

14:53.726 --> 14:56.478
who was really there for me,
and you took her away!

14:56.562 --> 14:58.314
Well, what was I supposed to tell you,

14:58.397 --> 15:00.316
how many Viagras and what position?

15:00.399 --> 15:03.736
Six, and something I call
"The Old Pocketknife."

15:07.948 --> 15:09.408
Evening.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.369
I'm looking forward
to the doctor being in.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.122
Oh.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.457
Hello, there.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.126
Maybe I could see you between periods.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.295
Oh.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.047
Looks like you've got your hands full.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.798
You're telling me.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.592
I just don't know what to do.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.552
Well, who do you think I should choose?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.679
Well, if it were me in this situation,

15:30.763 --> 15:33.140
I'd just go along for the ride
and see what happens.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.226
That's it?
That's your advice?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.853
Well, it's just what I...

15:37.937 --> 15:40.731
You know, I'm trying
to take some agency in my life,

15:40.814 --> 15:43.734
and you're over here telling me
to just "see what happens."

15:43.817 --> 15:46.111
- That's not helpful.
- Threesome?

15:46.195 --> 15:47.863
Excuse me?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.157
Uh, not with me!

15:50.240 --> 15:51.533
With me?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.496
Before we begin our service,

15:55.579 --> 15:58.165
I'd like to remind everyone
that I became a priest

15:58.248 --> 16:01.877
after my divorce, so yes,
I have had intercourse.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.964
- To start things off...

16:05.047 --> 16:08.175
- Daniel LaRusso's gonna fight?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.135
Oh, I misheard that completely.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.055
I've just been told
that a special friend of our Meredith

16:13.138 --> 16:15.975
has made a long trip
just to be here today.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.561
I'd like to ask Lois Griffin
to say a few words.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.023
That's the daughter of the richest man

16:23.107 --> 16:24.817
the dead lady ever worked for.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.237
Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.906
I, uh, I-I just wanted to be here today

16:30.990 --> 16:33.742
to say goodbye to Meredith and thank you.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.538
Thank you for raising me,
and-and-and for being there

16:37.621 --> 16:39.540
when no one else was.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.583
That's why I was so hurt when you left,

16:41.667 --> 16:43.335
and I always held it against you,

16:43.419 --> 16:46.839
but now I realize i-it wasn't your fault.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.257
You know she can't hear you, right?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.426
But no matter what happened, Meredith,

16:50.509 --> 16:53.012
thank you for being my teacher.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.763
Even today, you're teaching me

16:54.847 --> 16:58.517
that the people you love
most of all can still betray you.

17:01.687 --> 17:05.024
And now, a reading from
Paul's letter to the Corinthians.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.276
"Dear Corinthians, camp is good.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.570
"Yesterday we had hot dogs.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.947
"Please send strawberry Big League Chew

17:12.031 --> 17:14.742
but wrap it in a towel
because we're not allowed to have it."

17:14.825 --> 17:17.411
- Amen.
Amen.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.739
- Hey, it's Pewterschmidt.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.158
You still have that
all-night construction crew?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.785
I need a favor.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.370
Hey, you owe me.
I picked you up from LAX.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.582
You have to do anything
I ever ask for the rest of time.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.801
Ah, there's our belle of the ball.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.761
And she's chosen a suitor!

18:20.849 --> 18:23.102
Well, you two look happy.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.729
- How'd you decide?
- Money.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.691
But I do feel bad
for leaving Principal Shepherd all alone.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.693
Oh, you leave that to me.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.197
I may have one more clever scheme
hidden up my sleeve.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.424
Oh, my.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.219
This may be one of my
ocular migraines talking,

18:57.302 --> 18:59.096
but I see fireworks.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.390
Can I ask, is that
licorice on your breath,

19:01.473 --> 19:03.433
or is that just my licorice breath

19:03.517 --> 19:05.435
bouncing out of your mouth?

19:05.519 --> 19:07.646
Why don't you get in here and find out?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.450
Wha...
Oh, are we home?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.119
Why aren't we going up the driveway?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.788
Come on.
I have to show you something first.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.142
- Daddy, what is this?
- It's yours.

19:45.225 --> 19:49.229
I had to call in a favor or two,
but it's all for you.

19:51.231 --> 19:55.152
I figured you can come here
to sit whenever you miss Meredith.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.696
Daddy, this is beautiful.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.239
I'm sorry, Lois.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.409
You were right,
people you love can betray you.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.579
But if they're rich enough,
they can buy apology ponds.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.664
Thank you, Daddy.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.880
Oh, no, Rafael, the old gardener, died.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.757
I have a story I have to tell you

20:16.840 --> 20:19.760
and, spoiler alert,
you'll be getting another pond.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.894
Well, Dad, I guess our hotel worked out,

20:28.977 --> 20:31.021
and we actually made a decent profit.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.941
We sure did, son,
but we still got work to do.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.652
Hi, everybody,
I'm your karaoke host, Peter Griffin.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.987
I will be up here
far too many times tonight.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.572
Just a quick reminder to all of you

20:40.656 --> 20:42.241
that even though we haven't started yet,

20:42.324 --> 20:44.159
there's already
an hour and 45-minute wait.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.328
So go ahead and write down
the song you want to sing,

20:46.411 --> 20:47.788
hand it to me, and I will let

20:47.871 --> 20:50.332
15 musical theater people go before you.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.500
Remember, no repeats.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.252
We want to give everybody
a chance to sing,

20:53.335 --> 20:56.296
although there will be the same rotation
of five people up here

20:56.380 --> 20:57.923
over and over doing duets.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.300
All right, who's ready
for me to kick things off

21:00.384 --> 21:02.511
and then go third and sixth?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.584
