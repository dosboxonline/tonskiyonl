morning, a sixth woman was

a 24-year-old graduate student</i>

<i>at the University of Boulder.</i>

03:10.538 --> 03:13.062

struck again last night.</i>

03:13.062 --> 03:15.891
<i>Please,
just murder me now.</i>

03:17.284 --> 03:20.374
No, seriously,
put me out of my misery. Ugh.

03:23.594 --> 03:26.510
Blow it out! Blow it out!

03:26.510 --> 03:27.859
Okay, okay, okay, here we go.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.950
- Come on!
- Whoo!

03:31.950 --> 03:34.910
I love you guys.
You had way better 30ths.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.217
Oh, what could be better
than this?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.005
Yeah, we are here
to celebrate you
the way you deserve.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.315
There'’s literally
nowhere else I'’d rather be.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.972
- Come on, speech!
- Speech! Speech!

03:53.972 --> 03:56.453
All right, all right,
if you'’ll stop chanting, please.

03:56.453 --> 04:00.414
Well, I thought that turning
30 this year, of all years,

04:00.414 --> 04:01.763
was, um...

04:01.763 --> 04:03.373
was gonna feel pretty shitty.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.028
It'’s the year that Jake
unceremoniously dumped me

04:06.028 --> 04:08.683
after eight
very mediocre years together.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.251
The year I made
absolutely no progress

04:11.251 --> 04:12.600
toward an actual career...

04:12.600 --> 04:15.342
Mmm! Working for me is a career.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.995
...or in my personal life.

04:16.995 --> 04:21.739
But... now, here I am,
surrounded by all of you,

04:21.739 --> 04:23.872
my best friends
in the entire world,

04:23.872 --> 04:27.963
and I can see that...

04:27.963 --> 04:31.096
...I was absolutely right.
This completely fucking sucks.

04:33.577 --> 04:37.407
- Let'’s get drunk!
- Whoo!

04:37.407 --> 04:39.757
I don'’t know
if I'’ve told you lately,

04:39.757 --> 04:41.019
but I love you so much.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.283
- I love you.
- I just really love you.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.980
And you know what?
I have a feeling

04:44.980 --> 04:47.417
that you'’re gonna meet
your husband this year.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.072
I just know that you are.
I know it!

04:50.072 --> 04:52.857
And then, we'’re gonna
have babies at the same time.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.337
And we'’re gonna-- Look at me.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.991
And we'’re gonna name them
after each other,

04:55.991 --> 04:57.906
and we'’re gonna
breastfeed together,

04:57.906 --> 04:59.516
and our nipples are gonna
get chafed together.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.388
- Whoa!
- What?

05:01.388 --> 05:03.868
- They'’re gonna get chafe-y.
- Okay, wow.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.392
I can'’t believe
I'’m about to say this,

05:05.392 --> 05:08.090
but I think Bride of Jaägerbombs
has a point.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.614
Wait a second.
You are the most
anti-marriage person I know.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.921
But you know, maybe it'’s time
that you get back out there.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.750
- Like, how long has it been?
Eight months?
- Mmm, I don'’t know.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.926
Yeah, like, in three days.[Robin] Yeah. Right.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.797
Get on the apps,
get Jake out of your head,

05:19.797 --> 05:22.409
and get on
some new dick, baby.[Anthony] No! No, no!

05:22.409 --> 05:25.542
I would not be going anywhere
near any apps right now.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.283
Not with all this
serial killer shit happening.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.416
Oh, my God, have you been
listening to <i>Mark My Murder?</i>

05:29.416 --> 05:31.722
- Oh, my God, yes.
It is so good.
- Yeah, I know.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.376
I cannot wait
for the next episode.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.160
That probably means
somebody dies.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.249
- Is that too dark?
- Yeah.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.730
- Completely,
but I'’m right there with you.
- No, but seriously, Robin,

05:39.730 --> 05:42.646
all the victims so far
have been single women
that lived alone,

05:42.646 --> 05:44.779
and all went on dates
from apps, so...

05:44.779 --> 05:47.782
I'’m not going to sit at home
for the rest of my life
on the off chance

05:47.782 --> 05:49.740
that some dude
from the Internet

05:49.740 --> 05:51.263
- is going to murder me.
- Okay.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.004
You know what?
I'’m just not ready yet.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.919
And it'’s not because
I'’m afraid of a serial killer.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.748
It'’s more because I'm afraid
of having my heart stomped on

05:57.748 --> 06:00.708
by an insecure narcissist
with a mustache.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.235
Again.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.584
- Oh! Uh-oh.
- Not on me.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.194
Swallow it. Swallow.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.587
- Turn away!
- Someone take me potty!

06:10.587 --> 06:11.545
Go, go!

06:12.241 --> 06:13.721
Okay.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.245
[Eva] Oh, yeah.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.552
- Attagirl.
- Oh, God.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.988
- Kel.
- Yeah?

06:19.988 --> 06:21.468
Are you okay?

06:21.468 --> 06:23.905
I mean, this is really
out of character for you.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.297
It'’s fine.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.777
- I'’m going to be fine.
- Okay.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.650
Oh!

06:29.650 --> 06:31.086
All right.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.523
I really liked these shoes.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.395
All right, come on.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.571
<i>Hey,</i> Mark My Murder <i>listeners.</i>

06:37.571 --> 06:40.312
<i>We started this podcast
two months ago, when this
whole murder spree started,</i>

06:40.312 --> 06:43.272
<i>and there'’s still one thing
all the crime scenes
have in common:</i>

06:43.272 --> 06:46.144
<i>no sign of forced entry.
He didn'’t break in.</i>

06:46.144 --> 06:47.929
<i>They let him in.</i>

06:47.929 --> 06:49.539
<i>I mean,
clearly, as we'’ve said,</i>

06:49.539 --> 06:50.888
<i>it'’s the date that's doing it.</i>

06:50.888 --> 06:52.237

06:52.237 --> 06:54.283
<i>Ladies,
keep your friends close</i>

<i>and your Tinder dates
in public
where there are witnesses.</i>

06:56.328 --> 06:58.722
<i>So, every good serial killer
needs a name.</i>

06:58.722 --> 07:01.333
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- <i>We did
a bunch of brainstorming,</i>

07:01.333 --> 07:03.901
<i>and we'’ve landed on a name.</i>[male podcaster] <i>And I must
say, it'’s a pretty good name.</i>

07:03.901 --> 07:05.294
<i>Drumroll.</i>

07:05.294 --> 07:07.296
<i>The Swipe Right Killer.</i>

07:07.296 --> 07:09.472
<i>It'’s dark--</i>

07:14.303 --> 07:16.131
Stupid mustache.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.450
Valerie?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.455
Surprise!

08:19.455 --> 08:20.630
Happy birthday!

08:20.630 --> 08:23.198
What are you doing?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.026
I could have killed you!

08:26.331 --> 08:27.942
How did you know it was me?

08:27.942 --> 08:31.380
You are the only person I know
who smells like baby vomit

08:31.380 --> 08:33.121
and essential oils.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.992
It is intoxicating,
isn'’t it?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.126
Well, I came
to give you your card,

08:38.126 --> 08:40.520
but then I saw an opportunity
to teach you a lesson.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.521
Of course.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.568
A hide-a-key rock?
Jesus, Eva!

08:45.568 --> 08:47.962
What? I lose my keys a lot.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.616
Do you always carry
a full face mask with you

08:49.616 --> 08:51.531
or just when you'’re coming
to break into my house?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.837
Well, no. I wear it
on the bus to deter muggers.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.665
- Weird.
- Effective.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.320
Speaking
of crime deterrence...

09:06.110 --> 09:09.331
"I hope your birthday
is Tricera-Tops."

09:09.331 --> 09:12.247
It was the only one
I had lying around.
Just look inside.

09:15.293 --> 09:20.516
An appointment confirmation
for an "Armored Guardian
Security" system?

09:20.516 --> 09:24.302
Oh, absolute top-of-the-line.
You are welcome.

09:24.302 --> 09:29.003
No. I do not need
a security system.
That is ridiculous.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.874
Look, it was different when
you were living with Jake,

09:30.874 --> 09:32.484
but with this whole
Swipe Right Killer thing?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.443
Wait, you listen to
<i>Mark my Murder?</i>

09:34.443 --> 09:36.401
Yeah, of course I do.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.795
I was basically a profiler
before I had kids.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.668
Background screening analysis
for an insurance company

09:41.668 --> 09:44.105
isn'’t exactly the same
as criminal profiling.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.324
- But whatever.
- Or is it?

09:47.804 --> 09:50.415
Look, I am not judging you
for living alone.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.462
You have to be realistic
about the risks out there
right now, Eva.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.333
I mean, the world... Can--

09:55.333 --> 09:56.639
...is dangerous.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.249
Okay, can you--
Stop, stop, stop.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.425
Please stop cleaning up,
all right?

10:01.426 --> 10:03.341
All of this is temporary, okay?

10:03.341 --> 10:06.867
I just truly think that Jake
needs to go and pretend
he likes yoga,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.477
go down on a few baristas,

10:08.477 --> 10:10.522
and then he is going to
realize what he threw away.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.654
Oh, no. Okay.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.351
- Stop right there.
- What? What?

10:13.351 --> 10:15.223
I had a feeling
this is what was going on.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.659
What do you mean
what'’s going on?

10:22.317 --> 10:23.318
Who is this hot person?

10:23.318 --> 10:24.798
Scroll.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.714
Okay, why is Jake with her?

10:29.759 --> 10:30.891
What is happening?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.676
They'’re engaged? How? How?

10:33.676 --> 10:36.461
It'’s been eight months.
How does this even happen?

10:36.461 --> 10:37.637
This is-- Who is she?

10:37.637 --> 10:40.117
Another cop on his team.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.685
Wait. "Team" isn'’t right.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.296
Squad? What are
groups of cops called?

10:45.296 --> 10:46.602
Bastards.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.038
Well, let'’s not get political.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.954
I am such an idiot.

10:52.869 --> 10:57.308
I spent nearly a decade
with a total fucking loser,

10:57.308 --> 10:59.702
and you are telling me
it only took him eight months

10:59.702 --> 11:02.270
to commit his entire life
to somebody else?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.488
Yeah, pretty much.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.838
I mean,
for the last eight years,

11:04.838 --> 11:07.144
I haven'’t done
anything I wanted to do.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.319
Nothing.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.799
You know I haven'’t traveled

11:09.799 --> 11:11.845
because he was too afraid
to be on an airplane?

11:11.845 --> 11:13.498
You know, I didn'’t buy a car

11:13.498 --> 11:15.936
because he told me
it was too easy to die in one.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.068
Did you know
I didn'’t go to nursing school

11:18.068 --> 11:20.462
because he convinced me
that I'’m afraid of blood?

11:20.462 --> 11:22.507
Yeah, I know, it'’s insane.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.466
Did you know I'’ve never even
had a one-night stand?

11:24.466 --> 11:26.033
I have never had
a one-night stand.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.165
Well, probably because
the one one-night stand

11:28.165 --> 11:30.733
I thought I was having turned
into three kids, a minivan

11:30.733 --> 11:32.953
and a husband who has been
finishing the basement

11:32.953 --> 11:34.519
for five years.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.218
I am just glad that you made
better life decisions.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.961
No, Valerie, I haven'’t
made any decisions.

11:40.961 --> 11:45.879
For my entire 20s,
I have just let shit
happen to me.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.185
Well...

11:48.185 --> 11:50.797
I'’m not
in my 20s anymore.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.800
Eva, no.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.975
Valerie, thank you.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.759
- You have given me a gift.
- What?

11:56.759 --> 11:59.370
Thank you so much
for my security system.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.763
Really thoughtful of you.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.504
But I am pushing you out now.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.984
- I will talk to you soon.
- Don'’t do anything crazy--

12:03.984 --> 12:05.420
And I love you!

12:08.292 --> 12:11.252
<i>♪ We'’re gonna make a profile
We'’re gonna make a profile ♪</i>

12:11.252 --> 12:12.993
I know. Hurry, come in,
before I change my mind.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.734
- Okay.
- I got you, boo.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.388
<i>♪ Oh, we'’ll have our cake
And eat it ♪</i>

12:17.388 --> 12:18.650
All right.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.696
Now, we just need to
take some pics.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.959
Oh, yes, okay.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.961
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Of your face.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.789
Of your face. Yeah, like--

12:26.789 --> 12:28.573
Okay, well, I don'’t know what
people are doing these days.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.140
- Well, they'’re smiling.
- Okay.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.968
- Since, like, 1930.
- Okay.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.014
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.537
Just go a little higher, maybe.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.494
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:37.582 --> 12:38.670
- Good.
- Can I see? Can I see?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.150
- Yeah.
- Are you-- No.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.109
I look maniacal.
Please delete that.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.632
- Maniacal is hot.
- Oh.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.155
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, keep it then.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.767
And now, we just need
to write you a bio.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.117
Oh, God. Okay.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.033
It'’s chill. It's just like
some cute, little, low-key
details about yourself.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.557
Like, what is your darkest,
most intimate sexual fantasy?

12:55.557 --> 12:59.082
Mmm. No, I can'’t
disclose that so early on.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.562
- Eva!
- What?

13:00.562 --> 13:03.173
This is a magical
sex rectangle.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.435
You can get anything you want.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.002
- Hmm.
- In here.

13:06.002 --> 13:10.006
Like, uh, do you want to go
to a BDSM club

13:10.006 --> 13:12.835
with a dom who dresses like
a party clown on weekends?

13:12.835 --> 13:17.144
- Not really.
- Or get foot pics from a CPA
who wears adult diapers?

13:17.144 --> 13:18.972
No, that doesn'’t really
sound like me.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.495
Or... Oh.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.497
- Do you want to get
double penetrated...
- Ow.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.717
...by two roommates
who tell everybody
that they'’re stepbrothers?

13:25.717 --> 13:28.155
Well, that all seems
extremely specific.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.766
All right. Uh, done.

13:30.766 --> 13:31.767
Mmm...

13:31.767 --> 13:33.943
- Ready?
- I don'’t know.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.250
- I don'’t know. I don't know.
- Hey. We don'’t have to
do this tonight.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.904
No, I know. I know.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.732
Uh... No. Yes, we do.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.169
- Yeah?
- Yes, we do.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.954
I do not want to waste
another ten years. Okay?

13:44.954 --> 13:47.957
I want to feel like
I am calling the shots
of my own life.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.525
So, yes! Press it! Upload it!
I'’m ready for this!

13:50.525 --> 13:52.570
Yes!

13:52.570 --> 13:55.008
Let'’s get you that feeling.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.661
Wait, wait-wait-wait,
wait-wait, wait-wait.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.098
Aren'’t I supposed to be
doing this?

13:58.098 --> 13:59.621
No, this is just
like a secret trick,

13:59.621 --> 14:01.144
where you swipe right
on everybody,

14:01.144 --> 14:03.973
and then you sort through
the piles of messages.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.410
Oh, that is a good trick.
But can you slow down?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.151
That looks like
- a lot of swiping.
- Shut up...

14:08.151 --> 14:10.110
...and enjoy
the sex rectangle.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.807
Sex tangle?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.243
Oh, why didn'’t I think of that?

14:13.243 --> 14:14.331
- Good.
- Very good!

14:15.419 --> 14:17.117
Oh...

14:17.117 --> 14:21.121
This is a lot of dudes.
Here we go.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.340
Oh, my God, you'’re beautiful.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.690
Huh. "Thank you."

14:25.690 --> 14:27.649
I have a huge boner
just looking at you.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.259
Uh-uh.

14:29.259 --> 14:32.175
Eva, great to meet you.
What'’s your credit score?

14:33.568 --> 14:34.874
Hmm.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.748
Did you know
there are 13 million kangaroos
in Australia?

14:39.748 --> 14:40.836
"No."

14:41.968 --> 14:44.057
Wait. Did we go
to middle school together?

14:44.796 --> 14:46.102
Kyle C.?

14:47.364 --> 14:48.931
Eva V.?

14:48.931 --> 14:50.019
Looking for a daddy?

14:50.019 --> 14:53.631
Oh! Wait.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.895
Kyle? Kyle? Where did you go?

14:57.809 --> 14:59.072
What? No!

14:59.072 --> 15:01.465
Profile deleted?
You were just there.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.597
On your knees?

15:02.597 --> 15:04.686
It'’s not an MLM.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.557
I'’d love to show you
my penis.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.645
Ah!

15:32.235 --> 15:35.935
"Your place... or mine?"

15:38.459 --> 15:41.244
<i>All right, a few more clues
about the Swipe Right Killer.</i>

15:41.244 --> 15:43.159
<i>So, cops
are saying he might have,</i>

15:43.159 --> 15:46.032
<i>like, a background
or a specialty
in forensic science</i>

15:46.032 --> 15:48.817
<i>because dude is leaving behind

15:48.817 --> 15:50.514
<i>But what does that even mean?</i>

15:50.514 --> 15:51.994
<i>I mean there'’s no hair,</i>

15:51.994 --> 15:54.257
<i>no fingerprints,
no blood, no semen.</i>

15:54.257 --> 15:56.042
<i>Okay, all right. Wow.</i>

15:56.042 --> 15:57.478
<i>Here'’s the other weird thing.</i>

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
<i>He also appears to enjoy
a nice rosé.</i>

15:59.175 --> 16:01.003
- <i>Oh...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:01.003 --> 16:03.484
<i>Empty bottles have been found
inside each victim'’s home.</i>

16:03.484 --> 16:06.182
<i>Oh, man,
do you think he'’s bringing
the wine or is it theirs?</i>

16:06.182 --> 16:08.663
<i>Oh, he'’s got it from
my mom'’s car, for sure.</i>

16:08.663 --> 16:10.317
<i>Lady loves wine.</i>

16:20.196 --> 16:22.590
<i>They haven'’t found
any glasses at the scene,</i>

16:22.590 --> 16:24.984
<i>so it'’s not like
they'’re pouring wine and then
sipping it. So, I don'’t know.</i>

16:24.984 --> 16:26.768
<i>Does he drink it
right out of the bottle</i>

16:26.768 --> 16:29.075
<i>and then wipe it down
while he looks at the body?</i>

16:29.075 --> 16:31.686
<i>Ugh,
that is some twisted shit.</i>

16:31.686 --> 16:34.036
<i>The whole thing is nasty.</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:36.169
<i>Could you imagine being
on a date, just trying to
have fun with some dude,</i>

16:36.169 --> 16:37.561
<i>having wine together,
and then--</i>

16:48.616 --> 16:51.184
Okay. Where is this place?

17:05.763 --> 17:08.027
Okay. You got this.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.861
Mitch.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.433
Oh.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.696
What? I don'’t look
like my photos?

17:25.696 --> 17:30.440
No. Yeah.
Yes, you definitely do.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.835
I just thought that we were
meeting at your place.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.055
Well, it just so happens
that we are.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.058
I just bought it.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.278
That'’s a very good line.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.633
So, based on my expertise,

17:49.633 --> 17:52.201
it seems that you have
a long love line.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.899
- Mmm. Wait.
- If you look over here--

17:56.901 --> 17:58.468
Do you not have fingerprints?

17:58.468 --> 18:00.905
Oh, yeah.
Um, kitchen accidents.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.211
You know,
you get burnt all the time.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.953
Oh.
Cost of doing business.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.259
That makes sense.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.956
So, if you take a look
at your love line,

18:07.956 --> 18:11.133
which seems to run nicely
into your sex line.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.831
Okay, my sex line?

18:13.831 --> 18:15.877
All right,
I'’m starting to think that

18:15.877 --> 18:18.053
this might all be
a little bullshitty.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.056
No, I-- I believe this.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.189
Oh. Oh, my God, I'’m sorry.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.320
I'’m just fucking with you.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.061
Oh.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.672
- But does it really matter?
- No. No.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.241
No!

18:35.201 --> 18:37.420
I am so sorry. Excuse me.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.074
Yeah, just one second.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.773
Hey, Valerie.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.123
That is my hat
that I'’ve been looking for.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.994
And what are you doing here?

18:45.994 --> 18:48.257
I have totally been
wanting to try this place.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.998
Valerie.

18:49.998 --> 18:53.262
Okay, I might have put
a tracking app on your phone.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.395
Again?
You promised me last time--Whatever.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.875
You were acting
so weird last night
that I just had this gut--

18:57.875 --> 18:59.486
No. You need to stop
right now.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.314
This is the line and
you have catapulted over it.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.098
Well, don'’t you think
that having no fingerprints

19:03.098 --> 19:04.839
is a huge freaking red flag?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.449
Do you have
supersonic hearing?

19:06.449 --> 19:09.409
Statistically speaking,
the chances are infinitely low

19:09.409 --> 19:11.846
that any guy I ever meet
on this planet

19:11.846 --> 19:13.282
will be a serial killer.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.936
Really? And where
did you read that statistic?

19:14.936 --> 19:17.025
I read that on the Internet.
Wikipedia, actually.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.331
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.636
- Is everything okay over here?
- Uh, yeah.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.942
Eva, do you know this woman?

19:20.942 --> 19:23.205
This woman?

19:23.205 --> 19:26.382
I'’m her sister,
and I am a young woman.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.428
Oh, nice to meet you.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.344
Uh-uh. I'’m leaving. Stop.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.216
- Oh.
- Yeah, and I want you
to come home with me.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.739
- No!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.872
Strange man who I just met
on a random dating app,

19:37.872 --> 19:39.917
who I'’ve only known
for one hour,

19:39.917 --> 19:41.092
would you like to
come home with me?

19:41.092 --> 19:43.965
- You are not--
- Yes. Yes, I am.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.446
- Mitch, come on, bud, let'’s go.
- I have to close the bar.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.535
You really killed my momentum.
Can'’t somebody else do that?

19:48.535 --> 19:49.753
- Absolutely, yes.
- Great.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.407
And, Valerie,

19:51.407 --> 19:55.063
do not ever, ever, ever
pull this shit again.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.804
I am serious.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.328
- Stop it.
- You stop it!

19:59.328 --> 20:00.547
Go home!

20:00.547 --> 20:02.505
You go home!

20:02.505 --> 20:04.986
- Not with him!
- Take care!
Your drink'’s on the house.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.864
Oh! Oh! Sorry!

20:13.864 --> 20:16.693
You okay? It'’s okay.
I don'’t care.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.137
That was amazing!

20:26.137 --> 20:29.402
- You lasted so long!
- Ten minutes?

20:29.402 --> 20:32.492
Yeah, and I felt like
a lot of the focus was on me,

20:32.492 --> 20:34.145
which was new. It was nice.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.451
Good.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.584
And that thing
you were doing at the end?

20:37.584 --> 20:39.455
I'’ve never had
that happen before.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.421
Am I allowed to ask you
to leave?

20:50.510 --> 20:53.556
I just don'’t feel like
I'’m ready for a sleepover yet.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.906
I snore a little.
I sweat a lot.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.996
Have you ever heard
of night terrors? Because
it'’s pretty scary if you're--

20:58.996 --> 21:01.564
You know what? Um, I get it.
It'’s all good.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.696
Okay.

21:07.396 --> 21:08.745
You should call me sometime.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.399
Seriously.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.880
I'’d love to see you again.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.361
Maybe I will.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.102
Okay.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.756
I'’ll take it.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.019
Hey, do you want me
to call you a car or--

21:22.019 --> 21:25.327
- Nope, I'’m good.
- Is that what people say?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.676
Okay, bye.

21:30.941 --> 21:34.031
Well, you were wrong.
I'’m still alive. Ha!

21:36.120 --> 21:37.557
Huh.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.689
Kyle C. is back.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.700
<i>You'’ve got to be realistic</i>

21:50.700 --> 21:52.354
<i>about the risks out there
right now, Eva.</i>

21:52.354 --> 21:54.443
<i>I mean,
the world is dangerous.</i>

21:54.443 --> 21:55.749
Ah!

21:57.751 --> 21:59.318
Shit. Coming!

22:17.161 --> 22:18.641
Hi. Come in.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.688
Hi. I'’m Norman from
Armored Guardian Security,

22:21.688 --> 22:23.167
here for your evaluation.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.650
Please, come all the way in.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.260
As you can see, I'’ve--

22:29.260 --> 22:32.351
I'’ve recently upgraded
my security system.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.091
Yeah, we'’re gonna do
a little better than that.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.571
Yeah.

22:35.571 --> 22:39.009
My place doesn'’t normally
look like this.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.620
- Sure.
- Yeah.

22:40.620 --> 22:44.101
I'’m going through a...
transformational phase.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.016
No judgment. You do you.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.410
Oh, that'’s a cool ant farm.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.412
Oh, they'’re actually all dead.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.892
Oh, that'’s sad.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.241
But I'’m planning on
getting more.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.243
I found a ant breeder
on Craigslist.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.506
I just emailed her,
so I should hear back
from her soon.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.465
Oh. That'’s not weird at all.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.380
So, you must be

23:01.380 --> 23:04.121
getting a lot of calls
these days for installations.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.254
You know, with all
the murders in the news.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.864
Oh, yeah, totally.

23:07.864 --> 23:10.432
It'’s bad for the world,
but awesome for business.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.608
I wish I could get a look
at those crime scenes, though.

23:12.608 --> 23:13.740
Oh.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.394
Oh, no, no, no.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.657
I'’m-- I'm doing
night classes in forensics.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.050
- Oh.
- I'’m looking to eventually
solve crimes,

23:20.050 --> 23:21.443
not just gently
discourage them.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.749
Like a detective?

23:22.749 --> 23:24.620
A medical examiner,
- actually.
- Nice.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.579
Good for you.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.149
So, do you want to do this?

23:34.151 --> 23:35.414
What are we doing?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.459
The security walk-through?

23:37.459 --> 23:39.983
Yes. Of course.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.831
Hi!

24:01.831 --> 24:03.006
Here, got you a soda.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.355
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

24:04.355 --> 24:07.315
- Oh. It'’s good.
- What are you doing?

24:07.315 --> 24:09.273
Oh, just measuring the windows
and, you know,

24:09.273 --> 24:11.101
getting everything
just the way we want it.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.320
- Great. I'’ll be in here.
- Okay.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.240
They just found
a species of all-female ants

24:19.240 --> 24:22.591
that actually reproduce
by cloning themselves.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.158
I mean, that'’s
- just amazing to me.
- Wow.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.551
Who needs men?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.030
- I do.
- Oh, thank God.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.163
I mean for all men.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.165
I mean-- Yeah.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.601
Anyway, um...

24:32.601 --> 24:34.342
I'’ll send the estimate
to your sister,

24:34.342 --> 24:37.911
and assuming all looks good,
how'’s Thursday?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.652
- Perfect.
- Amazing.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.262
Love Thursdays.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.611
All right. Okay.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.789
Um, yeah.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.879
At the risk of losing my job
for blatant unprofessionalism,

24:49.879 --> 24:53.230
um, maybe
we could do something
after the installation?

24:54.231 --> 24:55.276
Like a date?

24:55.276 --> 24:57.931
Yeah. Like a date.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.541
Yeah, I will. I do.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.890
I mean, I'’m sorry,
I don'’t even know what I--

25:00.890 --> 25:02.544
- It'’s a yes?
- Yes, it'’s a yes.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.502
Yeah, amazing.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.894
All right, so, uh...

25:04.894 --> 25:07.070
So, I'’ll, uh--
I'’ll see you Thursday.

25:07.070 --> 25:07.984
- Yes.
- Okay.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.595
- All right.
- Yeah.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.685
- Lock the door behind you.
- Okay.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.034
- Bye.
- See ya.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.080
Yes!

25:17.080 --> 25:19.126
Still got it.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.522
<i>There'’s one
thing I keep coming back to.</i>

25:23.522 --> 25:25.741
<i>It'’s been bugging me
from the beginning.</i>

25:25.741 --> 25:27.917
<i>- The first victim,
Kayla Gardner, strangled!</i>
- <i>Right!</i>

25:27.917 --> 25:29.658
<i>Right.
But they don'’t really
talk about it.</i>

25:29.658 --> 25:31.399
<i>Like, everybody
since then has been stabbed.</i>

25:31.399 --> 25:32.835
<i>Yeah, is it
just like any other fetish</i>

25:32.835 --> 25:34.402
<i>and you gotta keep
escalating things?</i>

25:34.402 --> 25:36.317
<i>You start with strangling,</i>

25:36.317 --> 25:37.840
<i>next up is stabbing,
and then what comes
after that?</i>

25:37.840 --> 25:39.276
<i>Let me pitch you something.</i>

25:39.276 --> 25:40.713
<i>All right, hit me.</i>

25:40.713 --> 25:42.323
<i>What if she wasn'’t</i>

25:42.323 --> 25:43.977
<i>actually one of the victims?</i>[male podcaster] <i>Ooh!</i>

25:43.977 --> 25:45.500
<i>Yes!
What if the rosé in the house</i>

25:45.500 --> 25:46.849
<i>was a coincidence
and it'’s a fluke?</i>

25:46.849 --> 25:48.155
<i>Oh, coincidental rosé.</i>

25:48.155 --> 25:50.723
<i>Have we been looking at this
all wrong?</i>

25:52.420 --> 25:53.552
What?

25:55.205 --> 25:58.121
Okay, I mean,
are these people engaged?

25:58.121 --> 26:00.341
Are they mother and son?
I'’m so confused.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.908
So, how was
your date with Mitch?

26:01.908 --> 26:04.432
- Is he--
- Hot? Oh, my God.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.782
Yeah, it'’s, like,
mind-numbing. You have--

26:06.782 --> 26:08.610
No.
No, is he marriage material?

26:08.610 --> 26:11.526
I don'’t know.
I just met the guy.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.529
Whoa.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.837
Oh, my God. Okay. Wow.

26:17.837 --> 26:22.668
So, this is
the special portrait
that you want for Brad.

26:22.668 --> 26:25.801
All right,
I was half expecting
tasteful nudes, but okay.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.629
No, sometimes
I like to put it on

26:27.629 --> 26:29.805
just to remember
how amazing that day was.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.807
And this way,
he'’ll remember it too.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.288
Yeah. I mean, you do have,
like, 20 wedding albums.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.855
- Just take the picture.
- Okay.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.813
You'’ve actually never
let me touch this before,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.989
but it'’s kind of exciting.
So, let'’s do it.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.774
What could go wrong?

26:41.774 --> 26:43.776
So, how about Mitch?

26:43.776 --> 26:45.995
Oh, my God.
He'’s crazy good in bed.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.172
- No, Eva, you didn'’t.
- What? Kelly.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.435
Men don'’t marry
one-night stands.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.525
That is so outdated,
and it'’s also not true

26:54.525 --> 26:56.963
because Valerie, she married
her one-night stand.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.052
Well, okay, don'’t even
get me started on that.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.620
There'’s a reason
there'’s no maternity section
in bridal stores.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.623
Well, speaking of Valerie,
she gave me a security system,
which, I know,

27:04.623 --> 27:06.146
it'’s the most
Valerie thing ever.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.888
But the guy who came over
to do the walk-through,

27:08.888 --> 27:11.064
- I mean, he'’s really cute.
- Oh...

27:11.064 --> 27:14.328
- What?
- No, the BTK Killer
installed alarms.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.678
Oh, this is so random,
but do you remember

27:16.678 --> 27:18.506
Kyle Callaghan
from middle school?

27:18.506 --> 27:20.943
Yeah, the guy, he was--
He would always pick his nose.

27:20.943 --> 27:24.555
Okay, well, we matched online
on my birthday.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.950
And get this, he just moved
his vet practice
here to Boulder

27:27.950 --> 27:30.126
after six years in France.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.693
And he'’s a widower.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.652
Sad, but at least
we know he'’s single.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.610
Exactly.
And we have a date tonight.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.656
Oh, my God, Eva.
This is your guy.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.875
I have a good feeling
about this.[Eva] Kelly.

27:39.875 --> 27:43.705
This is the "you and Kyle
and me and Brad sharing
a retirement lake house" guy.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.664
- Take a breath.
- Okay. But just promise me

27:45.664 --> 27:46.969
you'’ll give him
a fair shot, please?

27:46.969 --> 27:49.058
I am going into this
totally open-minded.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.539
Okay, but your mind is
all that should be open.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.584
Nothing-- Nothing else.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.587
- Okay.
- Three dates. No sex. Okay?

27:56.587 --> 27:58.067
- Promise me.
- Fine.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.852
Three dates. No sex.
That'’s easy.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.463
No hand jobs. No blow jobs.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.639
No-- No jobbing of any kind.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.902
- Okay?
- Yeah, Kelly, I hear you.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.469
Let'’s see the pictures.

28:08.469 --> 28:09.905
Yes! I killed this.

28:12.778 --> 28:13.996
- Oh.
- Oh...

28:17.217 --> 28:18.914
Maybe Brad will like that one.

28:20.176 --> 28:21.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.594
Hi.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.033
Are you Sheryl?

28:51.033 --> 28:52.687
You look nothing like your--

28:52.687 --> 28:54.254
No. I'’m Sheryl.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.170
Oh, wow. You look even better
than your pictures.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.649
Why, thank you.[man] Shall we?

28:58.649 --> 28:59.738
Yeah.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.437
So happy I could help
you two find each other.

29:04.699 --> 29:05.656
Eva?

29:06.701 --> 29:09.225
- Kyle!
- Eva Beava! Oh, my goodness!

29:09.225 --> 29:11.706
Hi! I-- Oh. I--Come on, get in here.

29:11.706 --> 29:14.361
I don'’t really think anyone
ever called me that, but...

29:14.361 --> 29:16.189
- I did.
- Why?

29:16.189 --> 29:18.757
I mean, wow,
you look so much different

29:18.757 --> 29:20.280
than how I remember you.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.240
Well, hopefully
that'’s a good thing.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.982
- Oh, yes.
- You too. You look so good.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.897
Thank you. Yeah.

29:28.897 --> 29:33.336
I mean, what'’s it been,
like, 525,600 minutes? Huh?

29:33.336 --> 29:35.686
Uh, yeah.
- Something like that, I think.
- Right?

29:35.686 --> 29:38.341
We were in <i>Rent</i> together,
in high school,
you silly goose.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.865
- Right.
- Come on.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.215
Ow. Uh, yeah.
No, I remember. I remember.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.739
Yeah.
- I had the braces and stuff.
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.567
Yeah, no, it sucked.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.135
But now, I'’ve got
some hair on my chest.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.006
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.573
Hopefully that'’s a good thing.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.227
Honestly,
I could go either way.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.012
All right,
I'’ll take my chances.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.841
Oh-- That is, uh...

29:59.841 --> 30:01.234
You could probably, like,
braid that

30:01.234 --> 30:02.888
if you wanted to. Just...

30:04.803 --> 30:06.195
Sorry.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.893
Probably could,
but it'’s a little weird.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.764
Um, do you wanna
go to the table?

30:09.764 --> 30:10.809
- Yeah, I would.
- Yeah.

30:16.597 --> 30:18.120
You'’re a veterinarian now.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.992
- Yeah.
- That'’s cool.

30:19.992 --> 30:23.256
- Uh, do you love it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

30:23.256 --> 30:26.781
Animals are just
so compliant, you know?

30:26.781 --> 30:29.001
- Really?
- You just give them
a little anesthesia,

30:29.001 --> 30:31.394
and they'’ll do
- whatever you want.
- Oh.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.875
Oh, my God. I'’m sorry.
That'’s vet humor.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.485
Ah.

30:35.485 --> 30:38.358
But yes,
I love being a veterinarian.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.099
I believe every pet
deserves the best care.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.883
- Aw.
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>

30:41.883 --> 30:44.059
Can I start you off
with some drinks tonight?

30:44.059 --> 30:46.235
First off, I believe
it'’s pronounced "bonjour."

30:46.235 --> 30:49.238
But, um, what do you think?

30:49.238 --> 30:51.153
We'’ll just split
a bottle of rosé?

30:53.329 --> 30:56.202
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.030
Yes. That--
That sounds great.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.814
One bottle of rosé.
Thank you.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.427
So, you--
Do you like rosé or...

31:04.427 --> 31:06.038
Yeah.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.735
Ah.

31:10.042 --> 31:13.175
This whole online dating
scene, it'’s just--

31:13.175 --> 31:14.263
it'’s a hell pit.

31:15.134 --> 31:17.527
Ah. Yeah, it'’s...

31:17.527 --> 31:19.268
Hence why
I deleted my profile.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.443
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.141
I actually
only reactivated it

31:22.141 --> 31:24.273
so that I could, uh,
message you.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.753
Really?

31:25.753 --> 31:27.886
- Yeah, really.
- Oh.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.714
But I'’m back off the apps now,
and I just...

31:30.714 --> 31:33.413
I don'’t know, thought I'd see
how this works out.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.460
And?

31:37.460 --> 31:40.159
Oh, well, so far, I think
it'’s going pretty great.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.161
<i>Bonjour.</i>

31:43.336 --> 31:44.380
<i>Merci.</i>

31:46.905 --> 31:48.254
She got it right.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.864
I love helping people.

31:55.304 --> 31:58.612
Mmm. Oh, yeah.
Oh, you got a little...

31:58.612 --> 32:00.266
- Oh.
- Just--

32:00.266 --> 32:01.920
Oh, that'’s--There we go.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.446
- <i>Grazie.
- Yeah.</i>

32:06.446 --> 32:08.839
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow, she is
all over the place...

32:08.839 --> 32:10.580
Yeah....with the languages
tonight.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.713
Do you want to--
We can split--Yeah, no, no.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.062
Don'’t you worry.
I'’m a veterinarian,

32:14.062 --> 32:15.629
for God'’s sakes.
We make tons of money.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.066
And, uh, actually...

32:19.807 --> 32:21.722
- Whoa. Wow, impressive.
- Right?

32:21.722 --> 32:24.507
Yeah, I'’m actually an amateur
illusionist in my spare time.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.988
- Wait, really?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.034
Well on my way
to becoming pro.

32:29.034 --> 32:31.427
Anyways, look,
enough about me.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.474
I'’ve had a really
good time tonight,

32:34.474 --> 32:37.868
and, um, I'’d love to
do this again sometime,
if you'’d like.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.305
Yeah.

32:39.305 --> 32:40.610
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Me too.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.438
Unless, of course,
you wanted to

32:42.438 --> 32:45.050
continue the night
back at my place.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.966
<i>Three dates,
no sex. Promise me.</i>

32:47.966 --> 32:51.099
Uh, no, no.
- I'’m sorry, not tonight.
- Oh.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.840
I just--
I just really feel like

32:52.840 --> 32:54.973
we should probably
take things slowly.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.714
Yeah, for sure, slow.
I love it slow.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.064
Cool. Um...

32:59.064 --> 33:00.935
Well, thank you
so much again for dinner.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.241
Yeah, do you wanna--

33:02.241 --> 33:03.677
I can take care of this,
if you wanna...

33:03.677 --> 33:05.026
- This was so fun.
- Oh, you'’re gonna go now.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.028
- High chairs.
- I know, right?

33:07.028 --> 33:08.987
- Oh. Thank you.
- Uh, well...

33:08.987 --> 33:10.771
Just gonna check
one more time,

33:10.771 --> 33:13.034
are you sure you don'’t wanna
come back to my place?

33:13.034 --> 33:14.166
It'’s pretty nice.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.300
One hundred percent.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.347
Oh, my God.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.439
Nope, don'’t worry about it.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.224
I'’m kind of surprised
you called.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.660
Why?

33:30.660 --> 33:32.140
I don'’t know.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.273
I thought it was gonna be
a one-and-done thing.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.623
How dare you, Mitch?

33:36.623 --> 33:39.147
Okay, I'’m sorry, just, um...

33:39.147 --> 33:40.757
- Just one second.
- Yeah.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.198
<i>Eva?</i> Hi.

33:46.198 --> 33:47.590
Finally!

33:47.590 --> 33:49.070
This better be
an actual emergency

33:49.070 --> 33:50.724
because I am right in
the middle of something.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.421
<i>It'’s the Swipe Right Killer.</i>

33:52.421 --> 33:54.771
They just found a fingerprint
at one of the crime scenes,

33:54.771 --> 33:58.123
and it'’s unidentifiable,
likely scarred over.

34:00.908 --> 34:04.433
Sound familiar?
Yeah, because I fucking knew
that guy was shady.

34:04.433 --> 34:07.175
Okay. Yeah. Weird coincidence.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.483
But Swipe Right
also drinks rosé

34:10.483 --> 34:12.615
and has an interest
in crime scene forensics,

34:12.615 --> 34:14.182
and none of those things
apply to Mitch.

34:14.182 --> 34:15.618
No, I'’m just joking.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.272
I'’m doing night classes
in forensics.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.839
Do you not have fingerprints?

34:20.101 --> 34:21.885
<i>Eva, are you there?</i>

34:21.885 --> 34:23.757
Mom, I want a Popsicle!

34:23.757 --> 34:25.846
I told you, Mommy is busy!

34:25.846 --> 34:28.892
I can'’t keep doing
this whole thing
with you, Valerie.

34:28.892 --> 34:31.678
Okay, look, I know that you
think that I'’m being paranoid

34:31.678 --> 34:33.897
<i>or overreacting,
but I just feel like</i>

34:33.897 --> 34:36.639
I don'’t know what's going on
with you anymore, which sucks.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.337
Can we just make a deal?

34:38.337 --> 34:40.121
I will loop you in on
what'’s going on with me,

34:40.121 --> 34:41.427
and you promise me,

34:41.427 --> 34:43.124
like, on your favorite child
promise me,

34:43.124 --> 34:46.258
that there will be no
invasive spy shit of any kind.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.521
<i>I promise on Jonah.</i>

34:48.521 --> 34:50.479
That includes
sneaking tracking apps

34:50.479 --> 34:52.090
<i>onto my phone, okay?</i>

34:52.090 --> 34:54.831
Okay. Fine. I promise.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.485
Okay.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.660
Great.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.577
Why don'’t you come out to
the bar with us tomorrow night?

35:02.404 --> 35:03.579
With your friends?

35:04.493 --> 35:06.104
Yeah.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.802
Craig! You better cancel
your pickleball plans

35:08.802 --> 35:10.891
because it'’s Mommy's night out!

35:10.891 --> 35:12.458
Hey, quick question.

35:12.458 --> 35:16.418
Um, growing up, did anybody
ever call me Eva Beava?

35:16.418 --> 35:18.507
<i>Beava with a "B"?</i>

35:18.507 --> 35:20.814
Yes, with a "B." What-- <i>No.</i>

35:20.814 --> 35:23.208
Okay, that'’s what I thought.
Bye.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.731
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.385
You coming back?

35:26.385 --> 35:28.213
Yeah.

35:33.653 --> 35:37.831
Oh, ho-ho! Yes! Fajitas!

35:37.831 --> 35:40.007
Oh, my God!

35:40.007 --> 35:42.444
You guys, we go hard.

35:42.444 --> 35:45.099
Kelly, I need your phone.
I need to take some selfies.

35:45.099 --> 35:46.144
You just... Okay.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.797
Whoo! MILF alert!

35:47.797 --> 35:49.756
- Can you get her
to calm down, please?
- Uh-uh.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.627
There'’s no stopping this now,
trust me.

35:51.627 --> 35:53.325
I'’m gonna have to send these
to myself.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.501
So, Eva, you have a particular
glow about you this evening.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.807
Yeah, I know. It'’s from the sex.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.026
Yes, girl.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.680
But is it from the sex
with Mitch?

36:00.680 --> 36:01.985
Or from the sex with Norman?

36:01.985 --> 36:03.683
Uh, who is Norman?

36:03.683 --> 36:06.164
Oh, Eva'’s crush
from the security company.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.252
What?

36:08.601 --> 36:11.343
Okay, I'’m-- I am cool.
I'’m very cool.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.432
And it'’s actually
kind of your fault, but no,

36:13.432 --> 36:15.216
I am seeing Norman
on Thursday.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.000
- This glow,
this is all Mitch.
- Oh, yeah.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.220
I thought you were
with Kyle last night.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.527
Yeah, I was,
but Mitch came over after.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.703
I just feel like you'’re kinda
not really giving Kyle

36:23.703 --> 36:25.879
a fair shot, if you'’re still
sleeping with Mitch.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.620
No, no, no.
I'’m not ruling Kyle out.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.274
I'’m just saying
he doesn'’t really strike me

36:29.274 --> 36:30.710
as the
throw-me-up-against-the-wall
type,

36:30.710 --> 36:32.929
and let me tell you,

36:32.929 --> 36:35.671
that is exactly what is
getting me going these days.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.282
Hear, hear, sister.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.371
Okay, but sometimes,
people can surprise you.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.329
When I first met Brad,
he was super vanilla.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.288
And then, on our honeymoon,

36:43.288 --> 36:45.072
we realized that baby
likes to be spanked.

36:45.072 --> 36:48.075
- Baby?
- Okay. Ew.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.946
- What?
- Wait, who is spanking who?

36:49.946 --> 36:53.254
Oh, you guys talk about having
sex with randos all day long

36:53.254 --> 36:55.256
and I mention making love
to my husband...

36:55.256 --> 36:57.519
- "Making love"? Kelly, stop!
- Making love!

36:57.519 --> 36:59.129
We'’re married. It's making love.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.175
- Who does that anymore?
- I was eating here.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.698
Okay, all I'’m saying is that

37:02.698 --> 37:05.005
Kyle is the one you should
be giving a real shot.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.615
You know, like,
he is marriage material.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.269
And Mitch is fuck material.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.140
Wait.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.838
Does that make Norman
kill material?

37:11.838 --> 37:13.883
Oh, my God,
you'’re in a Fuck, Marry, Kill!

37:13.883 --> 37:16.843
Hey, hey, hey, everybody!
She'’s in a Fuck, Marry, Kill
right now.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.628
It'’s true, I am.
Wow. This is actually
the most exciting thing

37:19.628 --> 37:21.369
that'’s ever happened to me.
Okay, let me think.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.023
Um, okay, if that'’s the case,
I'’m gonna kill Kyle...

37:23.023 --> 37:24.981
- Uh-uh!
- I'’m gonna fuck Norman.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.940
- And I'’m gonna marry Mitch.
- No, no.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.942
You have to kill Norman
before he kills you.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.553
His goal in life is
to play with dead bodies.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.817
He'’s not gonna play
with dead bodies, you perv.

37:34.817 --> 37:36.689
- You don'’t know that.
- Am I missing something here?

37:36.689 --> 37:40.083
Oh, has she not told you
about his passion
for forensics?

37:40.083 --> 37:43.348
- It'’s a great job.
- Okay, okay, wait.
Wild pitch.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.306
Okay.[Anthony] You fuck the vet.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.742
You kill Mitch.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.222
Who doesn'’t have fingerprints,
by the way.

37:48.222 --> 37:51.181
Exactly. And you
definitely marry Mr. Security.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.835
Smart. I like that.[Anthony] Yeah.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.924
- Cheers.
- Oh, my God.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.448
- What?
- There'’s been another murder.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.927
- What? Oh, my God.
- No.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.929
Are you serious? Where?

37:59.929 --> 38:01.757
Oh, I am on it. I am so on it.

38:01.757 --> 38:05.195
Okay, female, 31, brunette,

38:05.195 --> 38:06.675
body found at
her east side apartment.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.111
Wait, that'’s right near
where you live, Eva.

38:08.111 --> 38:12.072
Okay, a partial shoe print
was left in blood.

38:12.072 --> 38:15.858
Police have determined that
it was a Ferro Calde sneaker,

38:15.858 --> 38:17.382
size 10.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.341
What shoe size
does Mitch wear?

38:20.341 --> 38:22.212
I don'’t know,
but it'’s probably huge.

38:22.212 --> 38:25.259
What size does Norman wear?
That'’s the real question.

38:25.259 --> 38:28.262
I do not know
because I'’m not just asking
people their shoe sizes

38:28.262 --> 38:29.829
when they walk
through my front door.

38:29.829 --> 38:31.700
Yeah, okay.

38:31.700 --> 38:34.268
I know that, like, you guys
are all kind of joking
about this,

38:34.268 --> 38:37.097
and I'’m cool.
I can be very cool.
I'’m so cool about this.

38:37.097 --> 38:40.187
But actually, I'’m very serious
because any of these guys

38:40.187 --> 38:42.145
could legit be Swipe Right
and kill you.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.712
Okay, I get it.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.845
It sucks that my whole
taking charge of my life thing

38:45.845 --> 38:47.803
has overlapped
with a crime spree.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.023
So, here is the compromise.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.895
I'’m good where I'm at,
so I will delete the apps.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.593
- Yes.
- And I will see Kyle again.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.248
And I will possibly
fuck Mitch again.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.467
- Thank you.
- Probably tonight.

38:59.467 --> 39:00.555
- Yes!
- A few times.

39:00.555 --> 39:01.687
Oh, put it there.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.645
Too many times.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.647
- And I'’m gonna keep
the date with Norman.
- That'’s my girl.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.127
But to ease all of your minds,

39:07.127 --> 39:10.217
I'’m going to prove
to all of you,

39:10.217 --> 39:11.523
especially you,

39:11.523 --> 39:14.308
that none of them
are the serial killer.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.570
How?

39:15.570 --> 39:19.008
We are going to Cinderella
this bitch.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.314
It'’s shoe time.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.708
Oh, if the Ferro Caldes
don'’t fit,

39:22.708 --> 39:24.274
you must acquit.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.667
That is correct.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.151
Hey.[Eva] Hi.

39:34.415 --> 39:37.200
Okay, should we go back
to my place or...

39:37.200 --> 39:39.159
I was actually thinking

39:39.159 --> 39:43.293
maybe we could do something
a little more intimate tonight.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.166
Why do guys always do that?

39:46.166 --> 39:48.386
Just call it what it is.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.083
What?

39:51.127 --> 39:52.738
Oh, were you not talking
about anal?

39:53.608 --> 39:55.610
- No.
- Oh, yeah. Me neither.

39:55.610 --> 39:59.658
So, I was thinking
maybe I could cook for you,

39:59.658 --> 40:01.050
if you'’re hungry.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.836
And, you know,
we could just talk,

40:03.836 --> 40:05.577
get to know each other
a little.

40:06.273 --> 40:07.970
Okay, yeah.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.755
All right, come on.

40:09.755 --> 40:12.497
- Maybe after
we could try anal.
- Yes.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.546
So, you seem to know
all about my work,

40:18.546 --> 40:21.157
but I don'’t know anything
about yours.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.245
Mmm.

40:23.638 --> 40:26.641
Yeah, that'’s
kind of on purpose.

40:27.729 --> 40:29.514
It'’s a little embarrassing.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.255
I work at my friend'’s
photo studio.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.344
Sounds fancy.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.868
Uh...

40:35.868 --> 40:39.262
Uh, you'’re probably
thinking Annie Leibovitz,

40:39.262 --> 40:40.742
but this is not that.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.702
This is the everyone
wears matching sweaters

40:43.702 --> 40:47.532
and touches each other oddly
kind of place.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.099
- Those still exist?
- Yes, they do.

40:50.099 --> 40:52.711
So, you went to school
for photography?

40:52.711 --> 40:56.018
Oh, no, no.
I am just the assistant.

40:56.018 --> 41:00.458
I just retouch things,
hand her props here and there.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.069
It'’s real life-plan,
dreams-coming-true
kind of stuff,

41:03.069 --> 41:04.505
so you should be
pretty impressed.

41:08.857 --> 41:13.601
Actually, the truth is
my mom got pretty sick

41:13.601 --> 41:15.385
and she ended up
dying last year.

41:15.385 --> 41:16.691
I'’m so sorry.

41:16.691 --> 41:19.041
And working for Kelly just

41:19.041 --> 41:21.304
made it easier
to look after her.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.437
She'’s all about family.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.221
She sounds
like a great friend.

41:25.221 --> 41:26.396
Yeah.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.051
You know,

41:29.051 --> 41:31.140
all the guys I'’ve been dating,
you are the only person

41:31.140 --> 41:33.578
that I have told
all of that to, which...

41:33.578 --> 41:35.318
is pretty interesting.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.016
Like, in a good way, though.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.540
What do you mean by "guys"?
Like-- Like, plural?

41:39.540 --> 41:42.064
Uh, well-- Uh, yeah.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.762
I mean, it'’s online dating.

41:44.676 --> 41:45.981
It'’s kind of how it works.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.679
What-- Are you okay?
What'’s...

41:47.679 --> 41:50.029
Sorry, I'’m just
a little confused right now.

41:50.029 --> 41:52.945
Did I say something
to upset you?

41:52.945 --> 41:54.555
No, um... No. You know what?

41:55.730 --> 41:57.036
I'’m good.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.516
- Okay.
- I'’m cool.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.996
I'’m not gonna make
a big deal out of this.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.912
- Everything'’s good.
- Okay.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.000
Oh.

42:06.393 --> 42:08.917
You know what?
I think cooking can wait.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.179
Ooh.

42:10.179 --> 42:11.267
Wow.

42:13.008 --> 42:14.967
All right,
it can definitely wait.

42:34.421 --> 42:37.467
Hey, that was incredibly hot.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.079
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.037
Well, just wait
until you try my cooking.

42:47.652 --> 42:48.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.393
Is everything okay?

42:50.393 --> 42:53.179
Oh. Yeah.

42:53.179 --> 42:54.876
Food'’s almost done.

42:54.876 --> 42:58.967
Oh, I just realized, I'’ve got
an early start tomorrow,

42:58.967 --> 43:00.490
so I'’m going to get going.

43:00.490 --> 43:02.841
I'’m just not that hungry
anymore.

43:04.538 --> 43:08.673
I-- I wanted to ask you
this earlier,

43:08.673 --> 43:11.545
- but, you know,
I didn'’t want to be dramatic.
- Oh.

43:11.545 --> 43:14.548
You'’re not, like,
using me for sex, are you?

43:15.418 --> 43:16.724
No.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.205
Okay, because, well,

43:19.205 --> 43:24.340
that would make me
very, very upset.

43:25.341 --> 43:26.691
No. No.

43:26.691 --> 43:28.997
Come on.
No, I'’m definitely not--

43:28.997 --> 43:30.912
using you at all.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.392
I'’ll see you later.

43:50.584 --> 43:52.020
And...

43:54.762 --> 43:56.155
Oh, my God, Kyle.

43:56.155 --> 43:57.765
Ta-da!

43:57.765 --> 43:59.680
This is too much.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.769
Crap. Really? I'’m sorry.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.466
- I always do this.
- No. Hey, hey, hey.

44:03.466 --> 44:06.078
Kyle, it'’s-- it's beautiful.
It'’s perfect.

44:06.078 --> 44:08.776
Got the baguettes, champagne.
We got charcuterie. Come on!

44:08.776 --> 44:11.866
"Charcuterie!" That'’s what
that'’s called. I always just
call it "cheese and meat."

44:11.866 --> 44:12.954
Yeah, well... Yeah.

44:12.954 --> 44:14.695
It'’s a little sweaty.

44:14.695 --> 44:17.176
I put it out this morning,
so it'’s been here for a while.

44:17.176 --> 44:19.657
I just wanted today
to be so perfect, you know?

44:19.657 --> 44:21.223
Oh, who is this little guy?

44:21.223 --> 44:23.008
Oh, yeah. I forgot about him.

44:23.008 --> 44:24.531
Come here.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.619
Okay.[Eva] Oh...

44:25.619 --> 44:27.577
And this little guy is Stewart.

44:27.577 --> 44:29.057
- Hi, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.059
That'’s how you hold the dog?

44:31.059 --> 44:32.452
Oh, gee. Sorry.

44:34.236 --> 44:35.760

rectal temperature, you know?

44:37.544 --> 44:39.328
Just... right up there.

44:39.328 --> 44:41.853
Anyways, we'’ll get him
out of here. And...

44:41.853 --> 44:43.593
champagne?

44:43.593 --> 44:44.725
Shall we?

44:44.725 --> 44:46.379
- Yeah, we shall. Thank you.
- Okay.

44:46.379 --> 44:48.947
Uh... Oh.

44:53.125 --> 44:54.735
- Are you okay?
- Sorry, I had to...

44:54.735 --> 44:56.389
Yeah.

We can go. There'’s
a nice place over there.

45:10.882 --> 45:12.361
Can you just hold that
for a second?

45:12.361 --> 45:14.494
Geez. I'’m gonna have to
put this guy down.

45:14.494 --> 45:15.582
- I'’ll be right back.
- Put him down? Oh.

45:15.582 --> 45:18.019
Buddy! Look, I just noticed

45:18.019 --> 45:19.934
you'’re a little bit out of
tune there on the E string.

45:19.934 --> 45:21.196

45:32.991 --> 45:34.601
Wow.

45:36.472 --> 45:37.822
Well, that'’s taken care of.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.780
That guy was way stronger
than he looked.

45:40.738 --> 45:41.782
Where were we?

45:41.782 --> 45:43.566
You know, uh,
I think maybe

45:43.566 --> 45:45.046
we should try this
another time.

45:45.046 --> 45:46.744
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.310
It'’s not about that,
'’cause... Not at all.

45:48.310 --> 45:50.312
But this was just
really memorable and... Yeah.

45:50.312 --> 45:52.445
- ...I'’ll talk to you soon.
- Do you want to do it
again sometime?

45:52.445 --> 45:54.099
- Bye, Kyle.
- I'’ll, uh...

45:54.099 --> 45:55.796
If you wanna talk later
or hang out...

45:55.796 --> 45:57.798
Yeah....sometime.

45:57.798 --> 46:00.061
I'’ll bring Stewart.[Eva] Yeah, I'’ll email you

Okay. Hi.

Stop screaming, weirdos.
You dropped this.

Oh.

Thank you.
Those are expensive.

Not all men.

47:03.081 --> 47:06.171
Yeah, but some men,
sometimes, dude.

47:07.215 --> 47:08.738
Holy shit!

47:08.738 --> 47:10.828
- That was a close call.
- Yeah.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.090
What are you doing here?

47:12.090 --> 47:14.135
I, uh...

47:14.135 --> 47:16.181
Look, I... I admit,

47:16.181 --> 47:18.792
I was feeling
a little bit anxious about how
your date with Kyle went,

47:18.792 --> 47:20.881
so I just wanted to pop by
and make sure

47:20.881 --> 47:23.666
that you weren'’t
crossing any-- any lines.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.974
Okay, this whole
sex police thing,
it'’s getting pretty old.

47:26.974 --> 47:30.238
It'’s a little weird. I don't
need a chaperone, okay?

47:30.238 --> 47:32.675
And honestly,
maybe our idea of happiness

47:32.675 --> 47:34.329
is a little different
these days.

47:36.418 --> 47:38.594
I just-- I feel like,
when you were with Jake,

47:38.594 --> 47:40.379
we were on the same page.

47:40.379 --> 47:41.989
Kelly, Jake sucked.

47:41.989 --> 47:44.383
Okay. Yeah, I can see that.

47:44.383 --> 47:46.167
I'’m not that Eva anymore.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.604
Can this new Eva not have sex
with everybody that she meets?

47:48.604 --> 47:50.519
Okay. You know what?
I'’m really tired,
and I'’m gonna go inside.

47:50.519 --> 47:52.043
Well, uh...

47:52.043 --> 47:53.435

48:17.198 --> 48:21.159

- Thank you.

49:09.468 --> 49:11.252
Hey, do you wanna
take your shoes off?

49:13.167 --> 49:15.822
You know, you can just
make yourself at home.

49:16.344 --> 49:17.389
No?

49:19.391 --> 49:21.175
I have booties I can put on,
if you'’d like.

49:21.175 --> 49:22.742
No, no, it'’s okay.

49:22.742 --> 49:24.700

- Eh. Sometimes.
- Yeah, that'’s true.

50:57.967 --> 51:00.840
- Uh, yeah, that got dark.
- Too soon. Okay.
Too soon, too soon.

51:01.971 --> 51:03.756
That was so good! Yay!

51:03.756 --> 51:05.018
Whoo!

51:05.018 --> 51:07.629
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No.

51:07.629 --> 51:09.327
Wow!

51:09.327 --> 51:11.633
The girl next to me
was freaking out.

51:12.765 --> 51:14.680
I am so sorry. Again.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.682
- Comedy, it'’s crazy.
- Yeah.

51:16.682 --> 51:18.423
Lacking social awareness,

51:18.423 --> 51:20.033
but I appreciate
that you went for it.

51:20.033 --> 51:21.382
Thank you.

51:23.297 --> 51:24.864
I have been wondering,
though,

51:24.864 --> 51:28.215
what'’s with this whole
medical examiner thing?

51:28.215 --> 51:31.175
You know, did you just wake up
one day and think...

51:32.132 --> 51:34.526
"Yay, dead bodies"?

51:34.526 --> 51:36.615
It'’s my chance to play hero.

51:36.615 --> 51:38.356
Find answers.

51:39.922 --> 51:43.535
And I guess I have
a morbid sense of curiosity.

51:43.535 --> 51:45.189
Weird, I know.

51:45.189 --> 51:48.148
I love
that you'’re so passionate
about something.

51:50.324 --> 51:52.283
Tell me something
you'’re passionate about.

51:54.546 --> 51:55.764
Oh.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.288
Well...

51:57.288 --> 51:59.377
- Oh, damn it.
- What'’s wrong?

51:59.377 --> 52:01.335
Uh, it'’s-- it's my sister.

52:01.335 --> 52:02.641
Oh, you have a sister.

52:03.642 --> 52:04.991
Oh...

52:04.991 --> 52:06.862
Oh, is she okay? What'’s--Yeah, yeah.

52:06.862 --> 52:10.039
Look, I'’m really sorry
to split like this,
but I gotta go.

52:10.039 --> 52:11.563
I can come...

52:11.563 --> 52:13.304
- No, I'’m sorry.
- Do you want me to...

52:13.304 --> 52:15.219
I can come with you.

52:15.784 --> 52:16.785
Bye.

52:17.351 --> 52:18.657
Weird.

52:21.094 --> 52:22.226
Brad?

52:23.966 --> 52:25.577
- Two High Lifes.
- Brad!

52:26.317 --> 52:27.361
Eva!

52:27.361 --> 52:28.928
- Hey!
- Hey!

52:28.928 --> 52:30.669
- It'’s been a minute.
- Yeah.

52:30.669 --> 52:32.888
Hey, how'’s--
how'’s Kelly doing?

52:33.802 --> 52:35.891
Your wife? Uh...

52:35.891 --> 52:36.979
What are you--

52:36.979 --> 52:38.938
Shit. She didn'’t tell you?

52:38.938 --> 52:41.419
No, she did not.

52:41.419 --> 52:43.638
Look, um,
don'’t tell her I told you

52:43.638 --> 52:45.858
because she must not
want people to know, but--

52:45.858 --> 52:47.642
Okay, you'’re
freaking me out. What?

52:47.642 --> 52:49.557
We'’re on a little bit
of a break right now.

52:49.557 --> 52:52.256
A break? Sorry,
that was loud. What--

52:52.256 --> 52:55.607
We were having trouble,
and I definitely, um...

52:55.607 --> 52:57.478
You what?

52:57.478 --> 53:00.873
Let'’s just say
I handled it poorly
and she was super upset.

53:00.873 --> 53:04.659
But then, she did like a 180
and suggested we take
a couple months to ourselves

53:04.659 --> 53:07.227
and then see where we are.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.534
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

53:09.534 --> 53:13.320
I mean, she has been acting
really strange lately,

53:13.320 --> 53:15.366
- so this makes sense.
- Yeah.

53:15.975 --> 53:17.498
And honestly...

53:18.107 --> 53:19.631
I miss her.

53:21.023 --> 53:22.068
I'’ll see you around.

53:22.068 --> 53:23.112
Hang in there, Brad.

53:23.112 --> 53:24.201
- Thanks.
- Bye.

53:25.767 --> 53:26.812
Hmm...

53:26.812 --> 53:28.901
So, where is Mr. Security?

53:28.901 --> 53:31.382
I am, like,
devastatingly curious.

53:31.382 --> 53:32.948
Okay, listen to this.

53:32.948 --> 53:36.909
He got an emergency text
from his supposed sister.

53:36.909 --> 53:38.737
- Not the sister story.
- Yeah.

53:38.737 --> 53:41.392
And then he got really weird,
and he just rushed out of here.

53:41.392 --> 53:44.221
Okay, that is--
- that is sketch.
- Yeah.

53:44.221 --> 53:47.963
And I am feeling
mildly sleuthy.

53:47.963 --> 53:49.835
So...

53:50.531 --> 53:51.967
why don'’t we follow him?

53:51.967 --> 53:53.491
Yes!

53:55.101 --> 53:57.059
Okay, we look a little sus
going this slow.

53:57.059 --> 53:58.713
Well, he'’s not
looking for us.

53:58.713 --> 54:00.454
No, I mean to everybody else.

54:00.454 --> 54:02.717
You'’re going 20 in a 35.
You should be going at least 50.

54:02.717 --> 54:04.719
I'’m sorry. It is my first time
tailing somebody.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.591
Not mine.

54:06.591 --> 54:10.029
I dated a cop for eight years.
We did weird stuff for fun.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.822
Get down!

54:24.173 --> 54:25.871
Wait, does-- does he live there?

54:25.871 --> 54:28.830
Uh-uh.
Said he lives near the hill.

54:28.830 --> 54:30.919
What is he doing? He'’s going in?

54:30.919 --> 54:32.399
I don'’t know.

54:32.399 --> 54:34.140
Did he just go inside?

54:34.140 --> 54:35.446
Okay.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.709
What is he doing?

54:38.449 --> 54:39.798
The lights are off.

54:39.798 --> 54:41.103
Oh...

54:41.103 --> 54:42.844
They'’re on.
Look, look!

54:42.844 --> 54:44.106
Wait. Okay, that'’s weird.

54:45.151 --> 54:47.327
Oh, my God!
He'’s positioning a body.

54:47.327 --> 54:48.807
That'’s a body.
He'’s positioning it.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.635
Okay, well, that is--
that is very Swipe Right.

54:53.725 --> 54:55.901
Okay, I know that sound.
He is dismembering her.

54:55.901 --> 54:57.511
This is next-level

54:57.511 --> 54:59.034
and actually,
we need to call the police.

54:59.034 --> 55:00.558
Yeah, but what are we gonna say?

55:00.558 --> 55:01.863
Okay, we haven'’t
actually seen anything.

55:01.863 --> 55:04.083
You know,
- I have seen enough.
- Aah!

55:04.083 --> 55:05.258
He'’s coming out.

55:06.215 --> 55:07.695
What is he doing?

55:07.695 --> 55:10.742
No!

55:10.742 --> 55:12.526
Shh! Be quiet. Be quiet.

55:15.007 --> 55:16.487
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

55:16.487 --> 55:18.619
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

55:20.404 --> 55:21.796
- He'’s dragging it.
- Get down.

55:21.796 --> 55:22.841
He'’s dragging it.

55:23.755 --> 55:26.845
I see one bag for the torso.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.847
And two for the limbs.

55:28.847 --> 55:30.588
No. A body is very heavy.

55:30.588 --> 55:33.199
He'’s really strong.

55:33.199 --> 55:34.461
Okay. Oh, no.

55:34.461 --> 55:36.028
That is a torso,
if I ever saw one.

55:36.028 --> 55:37.769
No, that could definitely--

55:37.769 --> 55:39.423
Down.

55:40.946 --> 55:43.122
- Let'’s just breathe
through this.
- Okay.

55:43.122 --> 55:44.297
And not get carried away.

55:44.297 --> 55:45.994
- Right.
- Hold on.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.433
- Okay, we gotta go in there.
- Hell no!

55:49.433 --> 55:51.478
Yes! What if somebody'’s in
there and they'’re hurt, okay?

55:51.478 --> 55:54.046
We can'’t call the cops until
we know for sure, all right?

55:54.046 --> 55:56.918
So put your
big girl britches on.
We'’re going inside.

55:56.918 --> 55:58.790
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no.

55:58.790 --> 56:02.924
I certainly didn'’t come... to,
like, evaluate a murder scene!

56:02.924 --> 56:04.622
Quit talking to yourself.

56:04.622 --> 56:05.971
Shh.

56:06.928 --> 56:09.496
Oh, my God. Okay.

56:10.149 --> 56:11.106
Try the door.

56:11.106 --> 56:12.934
- Mm-mmm.
- Just try.

56:12.934 --> 56:15.328
Okay, okay.

56:15.328 --> 56:16.416
Damn it, it'’s locked.

56:17.635 --> 56:18.679
No.

56:22.857 --> 56:25.382
Victory.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.340
Okay. Okay.

56:31.170 --> 56:32.650
Oh, my God.

56:38.569 --> 56:39.613
Go.

56:39.613 --> 56:41.310
Go! Go!

56:42.747 --> 56:43.835
Excuse me?

56:45.010 --> 56:46.664
What are you doing in here?

56:46.664 --> 56:48.970
Um...

56:48.970 --> 56:51.146
Wow, we are so sorry.

56:51.146 --> 56:52.452
What?

56:52.452 --> 56:53.932
Oh, no, no, no. Not--

56:53.932 --> 56:55.716
We meant-- Because we just--

56:55.716 --> 56:57.588
- No, you'’re here.
- Mm-hmm. You are here.

56:57.588 --> 57:00.765
And we'’re so happy
for that. Yay!

57:00.765 --> 57:02.854
I'’m sorry,
did I leave the door open?

57:02.854 --> 57:04.595
Um...

57:04.595 --> 57:06.858
We are
your new neighbors.

57:06.858 --> 57:11.384
We thought
we'’d just come on by
and offer you our services.

57:12.472 --> 57:14.343
You guys are very sweet,

57:14.343 --> 57:17.390
but you don'’t need
to be woke all the time.

57:17.390 --> 57:19.044
I mean, I kind of think
we'’re the--

57:19.044 --> 57:20.175
the right amount of woke.

57:20.175 --> 57:21.612
I'’m a normal person,

57:21.612 --> 57:23.962
and I have people
who help me when I need it.

57:23.962 --> 57:25.964
My brother just left.

57:25.964 --> 57:27.356
- Like, just now?
- Your brother.

57:27.356 --> 57:29.010
I blew a fuse,

57:29.010 --> 57:31.404
and I had him go into the
crawl space to flip a switch.

57:31.404 --> 57:34.189
And then he fixed
my garbage disposal,
and he took out the trash.

57:34.189 --> 57:36.191
- He'’s the best.
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.976
You know what? He actually--
He sounds it.

57:37.976 --> 57:39.717
Okay, you know what?

57:39.717 --> 57:42.502
If you need anything, you know
where to find us, so...

57:42.502 --> 57:44.417
Actually, I don'’t.
What unit are you in?

57:44.417 --> 57:46.245
- Bye! Bye.
- In the pent suite.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.382
I am a terrible person.

57:53.382 --> 57:56.516
I just assumed
he was a murderer,

57:56.516 --> 58:00.041
based off of ten minutes
of spying on him from a car?

58:00.041 --> 58:02.827
I mean, I could have
at least given it a solid 30,

58:02.827 --> 58:04.481
like a proper stalker.

58:07.614 --> 58:09.007
Oh, oh, God.

58:09.007 --> 58:10.225
Well, it'’s him.

58:10.225 --> 58:11.575
Well?

58:11.575 --> 58:12.619
- What do I do?
- Answer it!

58:12.619 --> 58:13.881
- Answer it?
- Yeah, answer it!

58:13.881 --> 58:15.361
- And say what?
- We'’re hanging out

58:15.361 --> 58:16.884
in front of your sister'’s house,

58:16.884 --> 58:18.625
we thought you were
the Swipe Right Killer.

58:20.627 --> 58:21.759
Howdy!

58:21.759 --> 58:23.412
<i>Hey, Eva.</i>

58:23.412 --> 58:25.153
<i>What are you doing?</i> What am I doing?

58:25.153 --> 58:27.634
- Chillin'’.
- Chillin'’ in a car
with my friend.

58:27.634 --> 58:30.550
We'’re just, uh,
doing some night meditating.

58:30.550 --> 58:31.986
<i>Cool. Um...</i>

58:31.986 --> 58:34.423
<i>I'’m sorry about
running off earlier.</i>

58:34.423 --> 58:35.860
No, it'’s okay.

58:35.860 --> 58:37.296
<i>Any chance
we can finish our date?</i>

58:37.296 --> 58:38.558
Yeah, I'’ll be there
as soon as possible.

58:38.558 --> 58:40.691
<i>Okay, thank you.</i> Thank you.

58:41.300 --> 58:42.301
Wow.

58:42.301 --> 58:44.042
Way to play hard to get, babe.

58:46.348 --> 58:47.567
- Hey!
- Hey.

58:47.567 --> 58:50.570
- Oh.
- Look, um...

58:50.570 --> 58:52.703
I think you'’re really great,
but--

58:52.703 --> 58:54.487
Oh, my God, did you
just invite me over here

58:54.487 --> 58:56.228
to tell me that you'’re not
interested in me?

58:56.228 --> 58:57.708
No, no, no. My God, no.

58:57.708 --> 58:59.623
Before I bolted earlier,
I should have told you--

58:59.623 --> 59:02.843
Whoa, whoa, wait.
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, no. No.

59:02.843 --> 59:06.586
Um, I have some anxiety
stuff with my sister.

59:06.586 --> 59:08.806
Okay. What do you mean?

59:10.242 --> 59:13.419
We went through
some traumatic shit
together as kids.

59:13.419 --> 59:14.638
She'’s super independent,

59:14.638 --> 59:16.030
and she never asks
for anything.

59:16.030 --> 59:18.467
So, when she said
she needed me, I, uh...

59:19.120 --> 59:20.426
I panicked.

59:21.122 --> 59:22.994
- Sorry.
- No.

59:22.994 --> 59:26.171
You do not have to be sorry.
I get it. I...

59:26.171 --> 59:30.741
I also have a sister who
causes all sorts of anxiety.

59:35.876 --> 59:38.357
Well, are you gonna
give me the tour or...

59:38.357 --> 59:40.838
Yeah, for sure.
Okay, well...

59:40.838 --> 59:42.317
Forty-three.

59:42.317 --> 59:44.842
This is the dining room.

59:44.842 --> 59:48.454
Oh, look at this. Hmm...

59:48.454 --> 59:50.064
Do you have an air fryer?

59:50.630 --> 59:51.718
I do.

59:52.676 --> 59:54.068
I'’ve also got a fancy blender.

59:55.896 --> 59:56.854
Mm-hmm.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.601
Maybe we skip
the rest of the tour.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.254
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:10.737
Wow.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:14.523
- Transformational phase.
- Yeah, I get it.

01:00:17.222 --> 01:00:18.353
Hmm? Huh?

01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:20.268
Yeah. Oh.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.923
Okay.

01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:25.534
Whose is this?

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:26.927
It'’s probably my sister's.

01:00:26.927 --> 01:00:28.581
She'’s always leaving stuff
over here.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:31.366
Right, the sister in
a wheelchair wears heels, okay.

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:33.978
Uh, that'’s a really
ignorant thing to say.

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.632
She can wear
whatever shoe she wants.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.111
No, you'’re right.
I'’m sorry. That was--

01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:38.417
I don'’t know why I said that.

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:39.679
How do you know
she uses a wheelchair?

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:42.377
Huh? Uh... You told me.

01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:44.641
I don'’t think I did.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.861
No, I definitely think you did.

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:51.473
You know what? Um...

01:00:52.605 --> 01:00:54.128
Maybe we should do this
another time.

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:56.348
Um... Hold on.
You'’re ending this

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.742
because I--
I asked about a shoe?

01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:00.047
I mean,
it is our first date, Eva.

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.527
I don'’t think it's a crime

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:02.702
to have another woman'’s shoe
in the house.

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:04.225
So, it is another woman'’s shoe.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:05.792
It'’s not your sister's,
so that was a lie.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:07.664
Okay. It'’s late, so...

01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:10.971
Yeah.

01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:13.191
It is pretty late. Um...

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:15.062
I'’ll talk to you soon,
Norman.

01:01:23.418 --> 01:01:27.684
Oh, men'’s... size 43.

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:29.686
Oh, shit.

01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.340
Oh, my--

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:33.994
Shit.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.345
- Here, let me help you.
- Oh, hi.

01:01:38.303 --> 01:01:39.521
- Thank you.
- No worries.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.352
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'’m okay.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:47.181
Just a good date
that turned into a...

01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:49.227
shitty date.

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:51.229
Oh.
They can turn on a dime.

01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:52.578
Be careful.

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:54.449
Yeah, you too.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.422
Oh!

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:15.906
Ooh...

01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:20.737
Fuck it. Self-care.

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.918
<i>Okay,</i> Mark My Murder <i>fans,</i>

01:02:27.918 --> 01:02:29.484
<i>urgent information coming in.</i>

01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:32.574
<i>The Swipe Right Killer
has struck again last night.</i>

01:02:32.574 --> 01:02:34.185
<i>The victim, Tara Leon,
was found</i>

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:36.230
<i>wearing one
strappy gold stiletto shoe.</i>

01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:39.538
No.
<i>And she wasn'’t</i>

01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:42.019
<i>coming home from a date,
as far as we know right now.</i>

01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:44.673
<i>They'’re saying she was at
some costume gala all night.</i>

01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:47.981
<i>So, is this a new escalation
from Swipe Right?</i>

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:49.591
<i>Everyone else has been on dates</i>

01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:51.593
<i>or maybe this was just like
a crime of convenience.</i>

01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.595
<i>Okay, okay.
So, then, what you'’re saying</i>

01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:55.597
<i>is that Swipe Right
is getting lazier.</i>

01:02:57.556 --> 01:02:59.123
<i>Or crazier.</i>

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.081
<i>Lazier and crazier? Okay, now--</i>

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:04.302
Valerie, you were right.

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:06.652
I think I'’m dating the killer.

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.398
Wow.

01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:14.747
This is the...

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:19.447
Whoa. This is very extensive.

01:03:19.447 --> 01:03:21.319
I totally killed
this presentation,

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.800
so get your grubby hands off
my laptop and listen to this.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.671
- Yes, ma'’am.
- Okay, so,

01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:27.629
after your embargo
on googling people was lifted,

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:30.415
I found this
in about 45 seconds.

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.591
Apparently,
his sister survived

01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:34.854
a botched home invasion
in 2004,

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:36.508
where their parents
were murdered.

01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:37.857
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:39.467
She was shot
and left partially paralyzed.

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:40.512
What?

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.600
Norman came home in the middle

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.080
- and the robbers fled.
- Whoa.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.560
- What do you think?
- I think that that explains

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.736
why he freaks whenever
she needs something.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:50.870
It'’s also the perfect
serial killer origin story.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:54.569
Okay, but why would he
just kill women? Huh?

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:57.311
Maybe one of the home invaders
was a woman? I don'’t know.

01:03:57.311 --> 01:03:59.923
The big picture is
Norman'’s interest

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:01.533
in being a medical examiner

01:04:01.533 --> 01:04:03.927
makes him well-versed
in crime scenes and forensics,

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.843
so he would know
to cover his fingerprints
or avoid leaving any.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.670
He is a size-ten shoe,

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:11.412
and the most damning
piece of evidence:

01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:14.851
he was most likely the last
person to see Tara Leon alive.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.288
- Okay.
- You know
what you have to do.

01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:18.898
- Yeah. Call the tip line.
- Call Jake.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:21.770
No. No.

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.294
Okay, you can try
your thing first,

01:04:23.294 --> 01:04:24.730
but when that doesn'’t work...

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:27.385
Uh-uh, I'’m definitely
not calling Jake.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.968
Drugs?

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:48.536
No. Serial killer.

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:53.759
Oh, dear God, no.

01:04:57.284 --> 01:05:01.027
<i>Hi, Eva. Um, Kyle here.</i>

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:02.463
<i>Um, you knew that. Sorry.</i>

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.596
<i>Uh, look,
I just wanted to say that</i>

01:05:04.596 --> 01:05:07.773
<i>I bought this guy
a brand-new guitar.</i>

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.340
Very sweet.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.820
<i>Actually, a way nicer one
than he had before, so...</i>

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.605
<i>Whatever, that'’s not the point.</i>

01:05:13.605 --> 01:05:15.346
<i>The point is,</i>

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:17.957
<i>I just wanted
to apologize to you.</i>

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:22.222
<i>I think I overreacted a little
bit the other day at the park.</i>

01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:24.398
<i>I think it was just because
I was trying so hard</i>

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:27.140
<i>to impress you that I forgot
how to be myself.</i>

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:29.316
<i>Anyways, uh...</i>

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.232
Mmm... Oh, no.

01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:33.886
No, don'’t...

01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:39.413
<i>♪ I'’m sorry, Eva ♪</i>

01:05:39.413 --> 01:05:41.067
Oh, wow.

01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:47.247
<i>♪ For the way
I acted the other day ♪</i>

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:52.383
<i>I really should'’ve
came up with some more
lyrics for this. Um...</i>

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:53.775
Strangely charming.

01:05:54.689 --> 01:05:56.126
Okay, someone arrest this woman!

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:58.824
For stealing my heart.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:02.349
Aren'’t you engaged?

01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:03.872
Oh, yeah. Winnie, come say hi.

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:05.004
Uh-uh.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:06.049
Ah, she gets me.

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.746
You are such a dick.

01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:10.009
Oh, relax, hormones,
you called me.

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:12.272
Hormones? You were
my last resort, okay?

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:15.667
I tried that tip line, like,
44 times, and I couldn'’t
get anyone to pick up.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.669
Yeah, it'’s because
this podcast has got
all these chicks

01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:19.801
thinking their online dates
are murderers.

01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:21.716
Women, so crazy.

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.632
Anyway, what can I do for you?

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:30.073
I think one of my online dates
might be a murderer.

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.640
Shut up.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.120
Oh, I'’m fucking with you.
Let'’s just...

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.643
- Okay.
- All right.

01:06:35.643 --> 01:06:37.297
Just--Feminism.

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.733
Feminism?

01:06:40.866 --> 01:06:42.389
So that'’s it.

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.348
I know everybody wants
to be an Internet detective,

01:06:44.348 --> 01:06:47.612
but I'’m telling you,
something feels very off here.

01:06:47.612 --> 01:06:50.528
That evidence, it'’s very,
very circumstantial.

01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:55.011
I know. I know. But I have
this feeling, all right?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.361
And I can'’t do nothing.
I mean, what if this guy
kills again

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.363
and we could have stopped it?

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:02.061
Okay, well,
aside from your "feelings,"

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:03.845
what else do we have?

01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:06.892
What else? Um, I mean, I'’ve
never seen him drink rosé.

01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:09.155
He does have
all his fingertips.

01:07:09.155 --> 01:07:10.678
But like I said,

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:13.116
he'’s really, really
interested in forensics.

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:15.205
Stop! Stop listening
to that podcast.

01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:17.033
- Why?
- Dear Lord. It'’s bullshit.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.991
Okay, well, the podcast
never cheated on me,

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.558
multiple times, so...

01:07:22.864 --> 01:07:24.344
Uh, yeah, like,

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:26.651
um, there were a few
wine bottles in the beginning,

01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.435
but that'’s because people
getting ready for dates,

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:30.394
- sometimes, they drink wine.
- Not everybody.

01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:32.265
And the print, it was smudged
and inconclusive,

01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:34.093
not the result of some,
like, mangled finger.

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:35.486
Okay, all right.
Well, tell me,

01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:37.879
what are the actual clues?

01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:40.969
All right, shoes,
the men'’s size ten,
that'’s a real clue.

01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:43.059
And Tara wasn'’t
the only one missing a shoe.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.712
All the victims were found
wearing only one.

01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:47.106
A high heel in every case,
a stiletto in a couple cases.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.413
We think the killer
is keeping them as, like,

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:51.893
a trophy or something, but
we didn'’t make that public.

01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:54.244
Mainly because
of that stupid podcast.

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.115
Okay, stop. Jake, stop talking.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.943
All right, you gotta
go there right now
and search his house.

01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:00.119
- I saw a shoe, a woman'’s shoe.
- A woman'’s shoe?

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:02.121
A woman'’s shoe,
- a black stiletto.
- Black stiletto?

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:04.036
And I don'’t know,
he'’s probably got more
hidden somewhere,

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:06.082
like in his closet or, like,
in the basement or something.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.127
- Sit, sit.
- Okay.

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:10.390
I just sat down
because I wanted to,
not because you told me to.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.175
They don'’t give away
search warrants

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:14.394
just because my ex-girlfriend
saw a shoe at a guy'’s house.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:17.745
I have to prove
that it was actually linked
to one of the victims.

01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:20.618
You know, we did find
a small amount of DNA
at one of the scenes,

01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:23.447
but we put it in the database,
it came back negative.

01:08:23.447 --> 01:08:26.102
You don'’t happen to have
any of his DNA, do you?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.407
No, I haven'’t
slept with him yet.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:28.713
Hey, I don'’t want
to hear you

01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:30.149
talk about other guys
like that.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.369
Again, Jake, you'’re engaged.

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:37.025
It still stings, okay?

01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:40.290
No.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.465
- No, I got it.
- No, no, no.

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:43.249
No, I got-- I got it, really.

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:45.773
No, you should not be going
and finding any DNA right now.

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:47.471
It would be
ridiculously risky.

01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:49.212
Well, you know,
the great thing
about being broken up

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:51.214
is that I don'’t have to listen
to what you think I should

01:08:51.214 --> 01:08:52.824
and shouldn'’t do anymore.

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:55.653
Goodbye, Winnie.

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:57.437
I was saying that as a cop,
not as your ex-boyfriend.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.137
Crazy.

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.316
- Surprise!
- Jesus Christ!

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:07.969
Oh, my God, Mitch.

01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:09.449
You scared the shit out of me!

01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:12.713
Hi.
What are you doing here?

01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:14.628
Well, you haven'’t
returned my calls or texts.

01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:15.934
Uh... You completely ghosted me

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.457
after you stormed out
the other night.

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:18.980
I know, I'’ve just been
really busy, but I do--

01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:23.985
Okay. Oh, no.
Are you crying?

01:09:23.985 --> 01:09:25.596
This keeps happening to me.

01:09:25.596 --> 01:09:28.251
- I try to be the cool guy.
- Uh-huh.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:31.210
But deep down, I-- I really
have feelings for you.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:33.821
Oh, no, you don'’t know me
that well yet.

01:09:33.821 --> 01:09:36.259
I'’m just gonna be
brutally honest with you,
all right?

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:38.435
I left the other night
because I thought you might be

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:40.393
the Swipe Right Killer,
which now I know you are not,

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:42.395
because another guy
I'’m dating actually is.

01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:45.006
But I did like having sex
with you, like, a lot.

01:09:45.006 --> 01:09:46.791
Whoa. And you are
very, very hot.

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:49.054
And it'’s-- it's been really
good for my self-esteem.

01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:50.490
So, thank you for that,

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:52.318
but I'’m not ready
to be serious with you.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:55.147
Okay, well...

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:57.802
maybe once I heal from this,
we can have sex again?

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.630
Oh, fuck yeah. Yeah. Later.

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.328
Uh...

01:10:20.694 --> 01:10:22.218
You can do this.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.176
Okay.

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:32.837
- Eva! Hey.
- Hey!

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.795
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:37.755
Yeah, I'’m sorry
to just show up unannounced,

01:10:37.755 --> 01:10:41.324
but I think I left one of my
favorite pearl earrings here,
so I just--

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:44.805
No, look, actually,
I'’m really glad to see you.

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:46.590
I really wanted to apologize
for last night.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.418
Oh, please, no.
Don'’t even worry about--

01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:50.115
No, no. Please.
I really wanna talk about it.

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:52.378
I know. I do too, but I--
I can'’t focus on anything

01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:54.293
until I just-- You know,
I really love this earring.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:56.034
It was my
great-great-grandmother'’s.
So, just--

01:10:56.034 --> 01:10:57.514
It'’s gonna take--
super quick.

01:10:57.514 --> 01:10:59.429
- Uh, okay, sure.
- Two minutes.

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:06.218
Yes.

01:11:09.221 --> 01:11:11.658
Okay. All right.

01:11:11.658 --> 01:11:14.748
If I were DNA, where would I be?

01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:22.103
Fuck.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:30.677
Eva.

01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:32.288
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.116
Hey. God, you know,
it'’s so weird.

01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:36.988
I could have sworn
that I had it here.

01:11:36.988 --> 01:11:39.643
It'’s a family heirloom.
It'’s really important

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:42.385
- that I find it.
- Could we maybe, uh,
take a beat here?

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.301
Please.

01:11:46.432 --> 01:11:47.433
Yeah.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:49.914
Sure, we can.

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:51.002
Okay.

01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:52.917
You mean, like...

01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.136
like this kind of beat?

01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:57.008
Wow. Well, that wasn'’t
exactly what I--

01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:00.577
Oh! Are the fingernails
negotiable?

01:12:00.577 --> 01:12:01.491
Sorry.

01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:02.579
But not really,

01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:04.189
you know, I just, um...

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:06.017
God, I'’ve really been
thinking about you lately.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:09.368
Careful.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:11.631
Oh, my God! There it is.

01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:14.939
Are you kidding me?

01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:17.811
This is really a relief.
This is good.

01:12:17.811 --> 01:12:20.597
You know, I would love
to continue this later,

01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:21.946
but I just gotta
call my sister

01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.600
and let her know
that I found it.

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:26.385
Eva!

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:30.520
Are you kidding me? Come on!

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:33.174
Okay.

01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.480
I did it.

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:36.613
Holy shit, I did it.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:39.137
Okay...

01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:43.576
Hair... check.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:45.448
Okay.

01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:47.058
Okay.

01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:50.322
Oh, God, that'’s gross.

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:53.281
Skin... motherfucking check.

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:55.022
All right.

01:12:56.328 --> 01:12:58.199
Okay.

01:13:00.854 --> 01:13:01.855
Boom!

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:03.814
Evidence!

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:06.120
Oh, you are not--

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.297
Jake, your ex-girlfriend
is here.

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.996
Yeah, well, you know I have
a name, right? It'’s Eva.

01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:15.739
Boom!

01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:17.523
- Evidence!
- Wow!

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:19.569
I bet you had no problem
getting DNA in that outfit.

01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:21.222
Oh, you are foul.

01:13:21.222 --> 01:13:23.355
Just take the samples and do
whatever you do with them.

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:25.444
Yeah, okay,
I'’ll get them to the lab.

01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:27.403
You said this guy installed
your security system, yeah?

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.274
- Yeah.
- Well, you shouldn'’t
go home.

01:13:29.274 --> 01:13:32.016
I mean,
if you wanted to be safe,
you shoulda just came to me.

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.539
I would'’ve told you
to go with ADT.

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:36.412
How about just saying,
"Nice work, Eva.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.675
Thanks for cleaning up
the streets, Eva.

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:40.981
Thanks for catching
a predator, Eva."

01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:43.506
Okay, how about, uh,
do you have anywhere else
to stay, Eva?

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:44.811
- Yes.
- Do you?

01:13:44.811 --> 01:13:47.597
I do, in fact.
I got many options.

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:49.642
So, don'’t worry about it.
Many options!

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:51.601
Moron.

01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:52.906
Many options.

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.431
Well, that sucks.

01:13:56.301 --> 01:13:57.563
Okay.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:05.789

01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:09.053

01:14:11.272 --> 01:14:12.360
<i>You know what to do.</i>

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.884
Goddamn it, Valerie!

01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:17.061
Okay.

01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:18.845
<i>Hi. This is Kelly from--</i>

01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:21.152
You kidding me?
Where is everybody?

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:23.067
<i>Hey, it'’s Robin.</i>

01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:25.373
<i>I'’m not answering because
I'’m out here, living life.</i>

01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:26.505
Okay.

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:30.596
<i>Hey, it'’s Anthony.
I'’m not here right now.</i>

01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:33.643
<i>Leave a message. Bye!</i>

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:39.692
- Aah!
- Whoa.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:42.042
Oh, people have got
to stop sneaking up on me.

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:44.523
- Do not come any closer.
- No, I just want to talk.

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:47.004
Get away from me.
No, get away from me.

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:49.789
No, get away from me.
I will call the cops.

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.225
- Are you serious right now?
- Sheryl!

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:53.140
This man is really
dangerous. Go! Go!

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.794
- Okay! I'’m going, I'm going.
- Go!

01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:59.495
Thank you, Sheryl.
I'’ll see you at book club.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:01.845
Holy shit.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.469
Valerie, are you kidding me?

01:15:17.469 --> 01:15:19.340
How is this the one time
that you don'’t pick up
my phone call?

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.081
Okay, I just got home,
and Norman showed up,

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:22.648
and I'’m really fucking
freaked out right now

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:24.302
because he knows
all of my security info,

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:25.695
and I need somewhere safe
to stay.

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:28.393
So please, please
call me back, okay? Okay.

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:33.224
Oh, my God.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:35.574
Okay. Well, last resort time.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.968
<i>Eva, hi. Hey.</i>

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:39.535
Kyle. I--
Did the phone even ring?

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.494
Hi. Um, listen, I have
a really huge favor to ask.

01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:43.974
Can I come over?

01:15:43.974 --> 01:15:45.889
<i>Yeah, of course.</i> All right, thank you.

01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:48.195
I will see you soon.
Can you just--
Can you text me your address?

01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:49.762
<i>Of course, yeah.</i> Amazing.

01:15:52.635 --> 01:15:54.854
Thank you so much again
for letting me come over.

01:15:54.854 --> 01:15:57.683
It'’s really nice of you.
I don'’t know where anyone is.

01:15:57.683 --> 01:16:00.120
Kelly or my sister should

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.600
be calling back any second.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.428
Of course, yeah. No worries.

01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:06.431
Hey, where'’s Stewart?

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:07.563
Who?

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:10.653
- Your dog?
- Oh, yeah!

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:13.307
He'’s, uh, locked in
the guest room.

01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:16.049
- Oh.
- Well, it'’s like
crate training for him,

01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:18.574
except, uh, just, like,
a nice big crate

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.836
with a bed in it and stuff.

01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:21.446
- He loves it in there.
- Really?

01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:24.014
Yeah. But anyways, you were
saying that Norman guy,

01:16:24.014 --> 01:16:25.755
you think he'’s
the Swipe Right Killer?

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:27.321
- Yeah, I think so.
- Geez.

01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:30.324
And, uh, you guys
were dating or...

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:32.979
I mean, sort of.
Not really.

01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:35.329
I mean... Ugh.

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:36.940
It is just
a little crazy to me

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.245
that you cut our date short

01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:39.986
because I lost my temper
a little bit,

01:16:39.986 --> 01:16:41.814
but you-- you didn'’t notice
any red flags

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:42.989
with a guy who is a murderer?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.341
Um, look, I'’m--
Hey, I am so sorry.

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.605
No, that was rude of me.

01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:52.999
You'’ve had a really hard day
and, uh...

01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:56.176
If you wanna, I don'’t know,
take a bath or something?

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:57.613
I mean, I could
order us some food.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.049
I have actually
been wanting to take a bath

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.137
for a really long time.

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:04.358
I don'’t have a tub
at my place.

01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:06.360
Oh. Oh, okay.
Yeah, makes sense.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.624
- It'’s just upstairs?
- Yeah, the bathroom'’s
just upstairs,

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.277
and there'’s a nice,
cozy bathrobe for you...

01:17:10.277 --> 01:17:11.844
Oh, great....you can put on.

01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:13.846
Just make yourself at home.

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.109
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:17.197
Right?

01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:18.329
Yeah.

01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:25.466
Mmm.

01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:07.987
Oh, yes.

01:18:11.295 --> 01:18:12.296
Oh.

01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:20.608
Antipsychotics?

01:18:21.784 --> 01:18:24.221
Nope, antihistamines.

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:26.353
Mmm, that tracks.
He does seem like a guy

01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:27.790
with a lot of allergies.

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:38.496
I'’ve got to get one of these.

01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:48.811
- Valerie?
- Oh, thank God you picked up!

01:18:48.811 --> 01:18:51.509
I left you and Eva like
a thousand voicemails.

01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:52.815
Oh, sorry, I was just, uh--

01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.817
- I think Eva is in trouble.
- What?

01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:56.470
<i>Kyle isn'’t who he says he is,</i>

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.646
<i>and she is with him right now.</i>

01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:01.040
She'’s not picking up,
so I left her a voicemail.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.043
But I haven'’t
looked up Kyle before
because we knew him, right?

01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:08.656
Well, Kyle is actually married
to a woman who is alive.

01:19:08.656 --> 01:19:11.485
<i>The veterinarian
is his wife'’s brother,</i>

01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:13.313
<i>who is traveling all summer.</i>

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:17.317
<i>Kyle is a freaking pet-sitter,
and he has a record.</i>

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:18.797
<i>Multiple assault charges.</i>

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:21.060
<i>And, Eva, he arrived in town</i>

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:23.846
<i>two days before
the first Swipe Right kill.</i>

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:27.110
<i>We were wrong about Norman.
Kyle is the killer!</i>

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.851
<i>You'’ve got to get out!</i>

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:30.591
- I see you'’ve borrowed
my favorite shirt.
- Oh, shit!

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:33.638
Aah!

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:36.597
Making yourself
right at home, hmm?

01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:37.903
Yeah. Can I have my phone?

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:39.818
No. I don'’t think so.

01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:42.386
I think it'’s only fair that,
if you have something of mine,

01:19:42.386 --> 01:19:43.691
I get something of yours, right?

01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:45.258
Unless you want to
take that shirt off.

01:19:45.258 --> 01:19:46.390
Oh, gross.

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:48.609
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:50.133
You know what?

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:52.265
I really don'’t
understand you, Eva.

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.876
I thought
you were different,

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:55.921
but you'’re just like
the rest of the girls, okay?

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:58.445
You never go
for the nice guys. Me.

01:19:58.445 --> 01:19:59.838
I'’m the nice guy.

01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:01.666
I'’m literally
the nicest guy, in fact.

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:05.278
I mean, fuck me,
I waxed my chest for you!

01:20:05.278 --> 01:20:07.237
I mean, not really. That'’s
just part of your chest.

01:20:07.237 --> 01:20:09.065
Oh, my God! You have
any idea how much this hurt?

01:20:09.065 --> 01:20:10.849
- Yeah. I do, actually.
- Yeah!

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:12.024
Girls do it all the time.

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:13.286
- Let me leave the room!
- Yeah, well,

01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:14.853
it'’s not about you
right now.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.725
It'’s about Kyle right now!
It'’s Kyle time!

01:20:18.596 --> 01:20:19.902
I did all of this for you,

01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:22.948
and you just insist on
pushing me away!

01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:24.471
Why is that, huh?

01:20:24.471 --> 01:20:25.821
Kyle, I...

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.344
You know,
the nice thing to do

01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:29.694
would actually be to let me
leave the room, so...

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:32.001
Oh, my God.
Now you want a nice guy?

01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:33.219
That'’s hilarious.

01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:37.745
Sadly, I'’m done being
a nice guy. You know why?

01:20:37.745 --> 01:20:40.400
Because I realize nice guys
don'’t get what they want,

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.533
and what I want right now
is simple.

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.100
I want-- Oh!

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.275
Idiot!

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:56.939
No!

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.984
Oh!

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:02.553
You already did that!

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:03.684
It'’s redundant!

01:21:03.684 --> 01:21:04.990
- Get off of me!
- No!

01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:06.383
You'’re all the same.

01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:08.211
Every single one
of you girls.

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.430
You just toy and you toy!

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.128
I didn'’t toy with you!

01:21:12.128 --> 01:21:14.565
I just didn'’t sleep with you,
you fucking psychopath!

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:17.481
I don'’t deserve
to die for that!
None of those girls did!

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:19.962
What girls are you--

01:21:21.224 --> 01:21:22.268
Ow!

01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:28.535
Ow...

01:21:32.539 --> 01:21:33.976
Kelly!

01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:35.934
You'’re okay! You're okay!

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.416
You saved my life.

01:21:39.416 --> 01:21:41.592
Yeah!

01:21:42.767 --> 01:21:44.987
Shit. Get the knife!
Pull it out!

01:21:44.987 --> 01:21:46.423
What do you mean?
Pull what out?

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:47.772
Get it out before he does!

01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:49.295
No, Kelly. I don'’t want to!

01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:50.775
You have to! Be brave!

01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:52.037
You have to!
He'’s gonna stab us!

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:53.996
- Okay, okay!
- Pull it out!

01:21:53.996 --> 01:21:55.301
- With what?
- Now! Pull it out!

01:21:57.956 --> 01:22:00.611
Oh, God!
This is really gross!

01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.439
Didn'’t you want to be
a nurse?

01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:04.354
I do hate blood.

01:22:04.354 --> 01:22:06.704
Oh, goddamn it!
Jake was right!

01:22:06.704 --> 01:22:08.314
Jake! We gotta
call the police.

01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:10.229
Okay, let'’s get you
out of here. You'’re safe.

01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:12.710
You'’re safe! Let's go!
You'’re okay. You're okay.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:27.420
- I can'’t look at it anymore.
- Okay, here.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.118
Ugh.

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.771
Okay, look.

01:22:30.771 --> 01:22:32.556
- I'’m going to take care
of all of this.
- Okay.

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.732
But your fingerprints
are everywhere inside.

01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:36.734
So I'’m going to clean up,
call the police,

01:22:36.734 --> 01:22:39.041
and just make sure that they
know this was self-defense.

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:40.346
You killed
the Swipe Right Killer.

01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:41.652
Of course
it was self-defense, Kelly.

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:42.958
Exactly.

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:45.351
Okay, stay here.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.049
Thank you.

01:23:21.474 --> 01:23:22.954
What?

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.310
Who are all these women?

01:23:35.923 --> 01:23:39.275
Oh, my God. Why are there so
many fucking phones in here?

01:24:00.644 --> 01:24:01.906
Hey.

01:24:01.906 --> 01:24:03.386
Hey!

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:05.214
What are you doing?

01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.390
You forgot your phone.

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:10.088
Oh! Thanks!

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:13.048
I was just cleaning up before
I was gonna call the police.

01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:15.920
Why do you have that?

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:19.141
You got a message

01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:22.405
from somebody named Amber
about a date?

01:24:22.405 --> 01:24:23.667
Who is that?

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.408
Yeah.

01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:28.498
Yeah, I think Brad
is cheating on me.

01:24:28.498 --> 01:24:31.457
I'’ve been meaning to tell you
this is his burner phone.

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:33.459
Kelly, I know you and Brad
are on a break.

01:24:33.459 --> 01:24:35.157
Yeah, but it'’s okay.

01:24:35.157 --> 01:24:38.116
It'’s just like a temporary
thing, so it'’s okay.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:39.944
Look. Look what I found, Eva.

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:42.120
Ferro Caldes.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.992
In his closet, size ten.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:47.169
Well, that'’s really weird

01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:49.606
because I didn'’t see those
upstairs earlier.

01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:53.088
And look, shoes.

01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:56.482
I found these
in his closet too,

01:24:56.482 --> 01:24:58.441
and I bet there'’s more
where they came from!

01:24:58.441 --> 01:25:00.356
Eva, we did it.

01:25:00.356 --> 01:25:03.185
We killed
the Swipe Right Killer.

01:25:03.185 --> 01:25:04.621
Look, technically,

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:07.058
you killed him
when you pulled the knife out,

01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:08.364
but we did it.

01:25:08.364 --> 01:25:10.583
Kelly, how do you know
about the heels?

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:13.108
The police haven'’t
told anyone about the heels.

01:25:14.283 --> 01:25:15.936
You don'’t believe me?

01:25:16.676 --> 01:25:18.156
Are you calling me a liar?

01:25:21.551 --> 01:25:23.553
Kelly, what are you doing?

01:25:25.685 --> 01:25:27.513
Oh, my God,
what have you done?

01:25:27.513 --> 01:25:28.645
What have I done?

01:25:29.994 --> 01:25:31.952
- What have I done?
- Oh! Okay.

01:25:31.952 --> 01:25:34.955
I have saved
a bunch of marriages.

01:25:34.955 --> 01:25:37.741
- What?
- I had a feeling something
was off with Brad,

01:25:37.741 --> 01:25:39.960
so I went through his phone,
and I found out

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.397
that he was meeting someone.

01:25:41.397 --> 01:25:43.050
I found out where she lived.

01:25:43.050 --> 01:25:44.356
I followed her home,

01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:47.794
<i>and then
I watched them together.</i>

01:25:47.794 --> 01:25:49.796
<i>That lecherous trash</i>

01:25:49.796 --> 01:25:52.669
was trying to steal my husband!

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:56.238
<i>But I had a pair
of Brad'’s shoes with me,</i>

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:58.196
<i>just in case
that something happened.</i>

01:25:58.196 --> 01:26:00.807
That sounds premeditated.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:01.895
- No.
- Okay.

01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:03.245
No, it wasn'’t.

01:26:03.245 --> 01:26:05.377
I did not want
to leave any footprints,

01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:07.379
in case something happened.

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:10.034
In case? What? And then,
something did happen?

01:26:10.034 --> 01:26:12.558
Yes! Yes, and she deserved it!

01:26:12.558 --> 01:26:14.256
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:18.129
And then Brad, he would pay
for what he did to me.

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:19.435
I know that serial killers

01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:21.132
<i>sometimes like
to take trophies,</i>

01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:24.004
<i>so I took one of her shoes,
and I was going to plant it</i>

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:27.182
in his stupid
fucking bachelor pad.

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.749
And then I had
this incredible idea

01:26:29.749 --> 01:26:34.841
that I could save
so many people from this pain!

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.714
<i>I would find these women</i>

01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:40.151
on these cheating
messaging boards,

01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:41.761
and then I would catfish them,

01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:43.415
<i>pretending to be
different married men.</i>

01:26:43.415 --> 01:26:45.287
<i>And then, I got so good</i>

01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:48.159
<i>that I could just identify them
based on the shoes.</i>

01:26:48.159 --> 01:26:51.118
Do you know who wears
stilettos, Eva? Home-wreckers!

01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:54.296
Have you thought
that maybe you are killing
the wrong people?

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:56.776
Men cheat too, Kelly.
- What the fuck?
- Exactly!

01:26:56.776 --> 01:27:00.040
And I was gonna frame Brad
for all of the murders,

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.433
but then, Eva, he called me,

01:27:01.433 --> 01:27:03.000
and he told me
that he missed me,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.697
- and he regretted all of it.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:04.697 --> 01:27:06.264
And then I didn'’t know
what to do.

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:07.918
And then, look.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:10.137
Look who fell into my lap,
Eva. Kyle!

01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.923
Eva... Eva, I saved you!

01:27:12.923 --> 01:27:14.533
No, no. Kelly, no!

01:27:14.533 --> 01:27:18.624
No! It'’s all perfect now.
Don'’t you see?

01:27:18.624 --> 01:27:21.584
Everybody is gonna think
that Kyle is Swipe Right.

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:23.368
I'’m gonna burn
the rest of the shoes.

01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:26.371
Brad is gonna come back home
to me, and then it'’s all--

01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:29.244
it'’s all gonna go back
to the way that it was.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.985
The way that it was?
You'’re fucking insane!

01:27:33.465 --> 01:27:35.685
Eva, it didn'’t have to
- be this way!
- No!

01:27:37.861 --> 01:27:41.560
We could have been
best friends forever!

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.042
I wanted to be the maid
of honor at your wedding!

01:27:45.042 --> 01:27:46.913
- Your wedding sucked!
- Oh!

01:27:46.913 --> 01:27:49.481
And you looked like shit
in that hideous dress!

01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:53.137
And your spray tan
was streaky!

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:54.486
Aah!

01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:03.800
Aah! A fucking kitten heel?

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.715
Aah!

01:28:05.715 --> 01:28:06.977
Oh, my God.

01:28:26.257 --> 01:28:28.215
You stabbed the shit
out of her.

01:28:28.215 --> 01:28:29.304
Yeah.

01:28:31.044 --> 01:28:32.655
You really owe it
to your sister.

01:28:32.655 --> 01:28:34.874
If she hadn'’t have called us
when she did, who knows?

01:28:34.874 --> 01:28:37.137
How did she even know
where I was?

01:28:37.137 --> 01:28:39.314
I only texted that address
to Kelly.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.054
I'’m assuming
she didn'’t share that info.

01:28:41.054 --> 01:28:42.708
Well, apparently,
last time you all went out,

01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:45.320
<i>your sister put a tracking app
on Kelly'’s phone.</i>

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:47.974
Also, on all
your friends'’ phones.

01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:49.411
And she eventually
tracked down

01:28:49.411 --> 01:28:50.803
his brother-in-law'’s name
and his address,

01:28:50.803 --> 01:28:52.239
and then sent it to us,
like, seven times.

01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:53.676
Geez.

01:28:53.676 --> 01:28:54.938
I think your sister
should'’ve been a cop.

01:28:54.938 --> 01:28:56.374
Yeah.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:28:59.856
I'’m glad you're okay.

01:29:00.987 --> 01:29:02.815
You'’re lucky to be alive.

01:29:03.729 --> 01:29:05.688
She did
a murder monologue.

01:29:05.688 --> 01:29:09.735
Like,
a explain-how-she-did-it-all
monologue.

01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:11.563
It was crazy.

01:29:12.825 --> 01:29:15.175
Hey, so, uh,
for some reason--

01:29:15.175 --> 01:29:16.916
I'’m still trying to
figure it out--

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:19.397
Uh, Winnie called off
the engagement.

01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:21.181
- Hmm, shocking.
- I know.

01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:22.792
I think it was
from you coming down

01:29:22.792 --> 01:29:24.402
and flirting
with me in the office.

01:29:24.402 --> 01:29:25.577
Oh, give me a break.

01:29:25.577 --> 01:29:26.709
Hey, Winnie.

01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:31.757
Anyway, uh,

01:29:31.757 --> 01:29:33.759
I was thinking maybe
you and me could, uh,

01:29:33.759 --> 01:29:36.066
you know,
- get back together.
- No fucking way, Jake.

01:29:36.066 --> 01:29:37.720
Not even like a
hit-it-and-quit-it situation?

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.461
Nope. No chance.

01:29:40.549 --> 01:29:43.247
Well, in that case...

01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:50.254
I ran the DNA on this.

01:29:50.254 --> 01:29:52.430
Came back clean.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:53.953
So, I talked
to that Norman guy.

01:29:53.953 --> 01:29:55.520
You didn'’t.

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.392
- No, no, I did.
- Oh, my God.

01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:00.264
And he seems like
a pretty good dude.

01:30:00.873 --> 01:30:02.222
So...

01:30:03.093 --> 01:30:04.573
I guess you have
my blessing.

01:30:06.705 --> 01:30:08.577
Well, I don'’t need it, but...

01:30:10.535 --> 01:30:11.580
thank you.

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.233
I appreciate that.

01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:18.587
Eva?

01:30:18.587 --> 01:30:20.458
Oh, I'’m okay.

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:22.634
There'’s my cue. Hey, Gordy!

01:30:22.634 --> 01:30:23.766
I...Hi.

01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:25.289
...was totally right!

01:30:25.289 --> 01:30:27.030
You were
in terrible danger!

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.988
Yes! Oh, my God.

01:30:28.988 --> 01:30:31.251
Who'’s paranoid now?
Who is paranoid now?

01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:34.429
Okay, has she been--Yep. She'’s been acting
like this the whole way over.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.779
Hopefully after
she found out I was alive.

01:30:36.779 --> 01:30:37.867
Valerie...

01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:40.043
I love you. Thank you.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.525
You are welcome.

01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:47.050
I think I really need
to go back to work.

01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:48.660
- Yes.
- Yeah, you really do.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.749
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

01:30:51.402 --> 01:30:52.447
I mean...

01:30:53.535 --> 01:30:55.754
I stabbed my best friend
with a shoe,

01:30:55.754 --> 01:30:58.583
but I'’m alive, so...

01:31:00.063 --> 01:31:02.979
Kelly. Like,
who would have thought?

01:31:02.979 --> 01:31:06.939
Well, I mean, if one of us was
going to be a serial killer,

01:31:06.939 --> 01:31:08.071
I would have picked her.

01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:09.768
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31:09.768 --> 01:31:11.335
I'’d have put my money
on Valerie all the way.

01:31:11.335 --> 01:31:13.424
Yeah, me too.

01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:34.227
Hi, Eva.

01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:37.143
Lila, hi. Uh... Oh.

01:31:37.143 --> 01:31:40.364
I just came to give you
your shoe back.

01:31:40.364 --> 01:31:45.108
Um, I also just wanted
to say I'’m really sorry.

01:31:45.108 --> 01:31:46.544
Oh...

01:31:46.544 --> 01:31:48.285
Which thing
are you apologizing for?

01:31:49.373 --> 01:31:50.983
When you followed me
to Lila'’s house

01:31:50.983 --> 01:31:52.811
and barged in there thinking
you'’d find a dead body?

01:31:52.811 --> 01:31:54.378
Or when you stole DNA from me

01:31:54.378 --> 01:31:55.814
and turned it over
to the police?

01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.381
I'’m going to give you guys
a minute.

01:31:57.381 --> 01:31:59.775
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:32:01.472 --> 01:32:04.823
Both. All of that.
Everything.

01:32:05.476 --> 01:32:07.391
I am so sorry.

01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:09.306
I mean, I know
that I jumped to some

01:32:09.306 --> 01:32:11.569
pretty insane conclusions,
even for me,

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:15.573
and I just think that my
paranoia got the best of me.

01:32:16.879 --> 01:32:18.228
Honestly?

01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:20.273
The alarm installer in me
gets it.

01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:23.581
The forensic student in me
is really disappointed in you.

01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.452
Like, none
of that DNA evidence

01:32:25.452 --> 01:32:27.019
would have been admissible
in court.

01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:30.545
Look, I know
that this is crazy,

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.547
but I think I'’ve already
proven I'’m kind of crazy,

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.592
but, like, in a fun way.
Anyway...

01:32:35.462 --> 01:32:36.855
Can we just start over?

01:32:36.855 --> 01:32:38.553
Just wipe the slate clean.

01:32:40.163 --> 01:32:42.208
Maybe go out
on a normal date?

01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:44.341
I don'’t think
anything with you

01:32:44.341 --> 01:32:45.472
is ever going to be normal,

01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.911
and I am somehow
very into that.

01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:51.914
So, is that a yes?

01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:54.177
Mm-hmm.

01:33:02.098 --> 01:33:04.883
For the record,
I really like
the hair-pulling.

01:33:04.883 --> 01:33:06.624
Oh, good,
because that'’s my specialty.

01:33:06.624 --> 01:33:08.147
