Everyone, welcome
to our summer block party.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.539
- Now, eat and drink up.
- Yeah.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.417
And also enjoy Pandora. It's great music,

00:42.417 --> 00:44.461
and all the ads are tailored to me.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.046

00:56.306 --> 00:58.224
Uh, must be some kind of mix-up.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.101
I-I don't even know what that product is.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.187
Hi. I have an unmarked, discreet delivery

01:02.187 --> 01:04.481
- addressed to "Peter Griffin's Penis"?
- Ah, yes.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.233
I will take these business papers.
Thank you.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.985
This was supposed to be here yesterday.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.279
I had to use tape and a Popsicle stick.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.324
All right, time to Slippery Slide.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.118
You sure? Slippery Slides are a nightmare

01:17.202 --> 01:19.329
of unexpected bumps and mishaps.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.498
Really? 'Cause the multicultural kids

01:21.498 --> 01:23.249
on the box seem to be having fun.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.584
- Hi.
- Hola.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.087
I'm a real boy who
was put here by a witch.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.255
Okay, Bri, watch and learn.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.928
Yay! Fun!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.888
Aah!

01:36.888 --> 01:39.390
Ah, public humiliation.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.310
You must be a United States senator.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.603
Good one, Joe.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.481
Come join me at the barbecue
with the other favored men.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.982
Yeah, we're having a blast.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.568
No, no, no. No, no. No.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.739
Wow, Meg insisted

01:54.823 --> 01:56.616
that one corner of the grill be vegan,

01:56.616 --> 01:58.743
and then she ate a rib
in front of everybody.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.495
She's all over the place today.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.665
Oh, my God, there's blood in my pants.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.375
And it's coming from my crotch.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.669
I've seen enough commercials
during <i>The Good Wife</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:09.629
to know there's only one explanation.

02:09.629 --> 02:13.007
Rupert, I'm having my period.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.551
It's a true rite of passage,

02:14.551 --> 02:16.719
like an Italian's baptism.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.013
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,

02:19.097 --> 02:20.473
you will now drive a Camaro,

02:20.557 --> 02:22.642
hate every minute
of your yearly vacation to Italy

02:22.642 --> 02:25.645
and get very upset
when your sister starts to date.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.605
Sorry I'm late. I brought Clark.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.690
Hey!

02:28.690 --> 02:29.983
Father, drown me in this water.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.651
She's breaking my heart.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.534
I'm exhausted. Three beers at a barbecue,

02:39.534 --> 02:42.162
and my whole night
was hand-against-the-wall pees.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.997
What happened to me? I feel like...

02:43.997 --> 02:45.373
I feel like I'm in a funk.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.083
I'm also in a funk.

02:47.167 --> 02:51.045
But, nah, I, too,
feel age-related weariness.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.965
Yeah, I'm also pretty down.
My real estate agent died.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.842
- What?
- My real estate agent.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.303
Like most single men,
my only Christmas cards

02:58.303 --> 03:00.972
are from my realtor
and the guy who sold me my car.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.348
We kind of aged together.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.911
How did he die?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.704
He was screwing a client's wife,

04:06.788 --> 04:07.914
and the guy shot him.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.499
You know, I'm pretty down, too.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.793
The other day, I was
watching the birthdays segment

04:11.793 --> 04:13.127
on <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:15.338
Axl Rose is 60.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.007
Wow, 60? Cleveland, how old is Heavy D?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.051
- Dead.
- Aw, that sucks.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.302
And I don't know about you guys,

04:21.386 --> 04:23.012
but I'm terrified of everything now.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.430
Like teenagers.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.808
I hear that. If I see one on my route,

04:26.808 --> 04:28.309
I don't deliver the mail.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.436
- What do you do with it?
- Throw it in the ocean.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.106
A seagull once fished out
a college acceptance letter.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.649
Got to go to Fordham.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.652
Welcome to the Fordham class of 2026.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.408
All right.
Glad someone's excited.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.951
Man, what the hell happened to us?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.619
Why are we such losers?

04:48.955 --> 04:52.542
Sounds like you fellas are
finding yourselves in a trough.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.127
Oh, hey, Mr. Mayor. How are you?

04:54.127 --> 04:57.088
Hey, can we talk about
expanding bike lanes in urban centers?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.798
Quagmire, shut up. <i>- You</i> shut up.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.259
We're not gonna change
the Earth with silence, Peter.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.802
If I may say so,

05:02.802 --> 05:06.389
I think you boys need to stop
sitting in bars and cubicles

05:06.389 --> 05:10.018
and go recapture your frontier spirit.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.020
Two terrible airlines?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.689
I own a dude ranch
on the outskirts of town.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
You fellas should spend a weekend there.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.485
You'd be surprised what a man can achieve

05:19.569 --> 05:22.947
when he steps away
from the comforts of city life.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.365
I bet you'll find your courage

05:24.449 --> 05:27.577
and, who knows,
maybe even some peace of mind.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.496
Well, I think going
there sounds like a great idea.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.831
Yeah, it's exactly what we need.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.708
- I'm in!
- I've never seen a horse.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.669
Great, it's settled.
We are going to a dude ranch.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.338
- All right!
- Yeehaw!

05:38.338 --> 05:41.299
I happen to know Austin, Texas,
has eight-foot bicycle lanes.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.259
Now, I'm not looking
for anything that expansive,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.428
but if a greener Quahog
is what we're after,

05:45.428 --> 05:47.138
I think we've got to
start moving the needle.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.681
Oh, so just get rid of the sidewalks?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.932
That's not what I'm saying, Joe.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.101
It sounds like that's what you're saying.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.853
Hey, whatever this is?

05:53.853 --> 05:56.773
Wrap it up before
y'all show up to the ranch.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.360
Yes, sir. And do we need
special clothes for ranch dressing?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.737
I'd wrap that up, too.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.504
- Wow, look at this place.
- It's pretty cool.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.923
Oh, that's a horse. I've seen those.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.467
- Morning, fellas.
- Morning, Mr. Mayor.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.095
Hey, can I get a room
far away from the ice machine?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.721
- Ice machine?
- See, that's...

06:28.805 --> 06:30.431
that's why I want to be away from it.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.476
Fellas, I think we had a miscommunication.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.604
This isn't a hotel. It's a working ranch.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.481
You'll do your chores during the day

06:38.481 --> 06:40.400
and sleep in the barn at night.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.443
What? I thought this was a vacation.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.612
Yeah, I thought it'd
be fun, like <i>Young Guns</i>

06:44.612 --> 06:47.615
with Kiefer Sutherland
and Blue Diamond Walnuts.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.534
Sorry, but you're not gonna find

06:49.534 --> 06:52.453
your pioneer spirit in a hotel.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.832
Here, have a hat.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.959
My own cowboy hat.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.630
Listen up. This isn't just a hat.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.340
It's an oath.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.760
An oath that you'll live
by the cowboy's code of honor.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.929
You'll wear it at all times.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.098
You'll put it over your face
when you sleep,

07:12.098 --> 07:15.059
over your chest when
you're delivering bad news,

07:15.143 --> 07:17.145
and over your privates when an outhouse

07:17.145 --> 07:19.439
falls down comically around you.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.690
Aah! Help!

07:22.483 --> 07:24.902
Mine's small enough
that I don't need the hat.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.737
We're gonna fix that.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.996
Oh, Rupert, I need my heat pad,

07:34.996 --> 07:36.622
I need Kate, I need Leo,

07:36.706 --> 07:38.082
and I need ice cream.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.126
And I need not a word from you about it.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.961
- Hey, Stewie.
- Oh, hey, Bri.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.088
Guess who woke up to a <i>Red Dawn?</i>

07:44.172 --> 07:45.298
- What?
- You know.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.133
Bobbin' with the Red Robin.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.594
Call off <i>The Hunt for Red October,</i>
because we found it.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.637
Red Rover, Red Rover,

07:51.721 --> 07:53.473
can't go in the pool today, over.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.141
None of these are actual phrases.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.684
Says the man.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.060
I'm having my period.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.313
It's like <i>The Shining</i> elevator down there.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.398
My 21st Century Box

08:02.482 --> 08:04.650
has been conquered by Eric the Very Red.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.527
Yeah, this is getting dangerously close

08:06.611 --> 08:08.070
to a <i>Will & Grace</i> now.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.739
But if you're bleeding
down there, it's clearly

08:09.739 --> 08:12.074
because you hurt yourself
on the Slippery Slide.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.118
Oh, yeah? If I'm not having my period,

08:14.202 --> 08:16.120
then why am I drinking herbal tea

08:16.204 --> 08:18.831
from a large earthenware mug
with no handle on it?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.417
Stewie, trust me, boys can't get periods.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.420
Brian, it's 2022-- there's no such thing
as a boy anymore.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.797
Or a girl. Just a vast sea

08:26.881 --> 08:28.549
of chubby "theys" and "thems,"

08:28.633 --> 08:31.010
so coddled by their
sanctimonious woke parents

08:31.010 --> 08:33.971
who think activism
is virtue-signaling on Instagram.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.681
If Martin Luther King could come back,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.308
and see what they were doing in his name,

08:37.308 --> 08:39.435
he'd never stop throwing up.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.773
Maybe...

08:43.773 --> 08:45.858
maybe you are having your period.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.531
If you fellas are gonna become cowboys,

08:51.531 --> 08:54.200
the first thing we
need to do is pair you all up

08:54.200 --> 08:55.993
- with a horse.
- Great.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.371
- I want this one.
- Now, hold on, Peter.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.915
Real cowboys don't choose their horse.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.292
The horse chooses them.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.922
Hey, Peter, just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.924
Yeah, I was pretty bummed,
but then I found

10:34.008 --> 10:36.218
these great desserts labeled "cow pie."

10:36.302 --> 10:38.220
Hmm.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.723
You're off to
a real bad start here, Peter.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.351
Just a real bad start.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.909
Wow, can't believe
we're doing a real cattle drive.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.702
I know, look at us.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.037
We're cowboys.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.082
Now, hold on,
you fellas ain't cowboys yet.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.751
Not until you blaze your own trails.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.003
A buddy of mine in high school
could blaze his own trail.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.838
Used to do it on the floor
of the locker room

11:12.922 --> 11:14.715
and we'd be like, "Aah."

11:14.799 --> 11:16.842
While I appreciate the anecdote,

11:16.926 --> 11:19.428
we like to keep our entendre singular

11:19.512 --> 11:20.763
out here on the prairie.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.056
Yes, sir.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.058
What I mean, fellas,

11:24.058 --> 11:26.143
is that to find your courage,

11:26.227 --> 11:28.396
you need to do the last leg
of this journey

11:28.396 --> 11:32.149
on your own and drive
these cattle back to camp.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.068
Awesome. I'll drive this one.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.571
Peter, the cattle chooses you.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.867

11:41.951 --> 11:43.994

11:47.081 --> 11:49.583
Rupert, where's my Kotex sanitary belt?

11:49.667 --> 11:52.461
And do we still have any
Wampole's vaginal cones?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.797
Well, this is weird. No blood.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.091
It's only been a day, I don't understand.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.635
No, I'm not going to ask

11:59.719 --> 12:02.263
about feminine hygiene issues on 4chan.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.889
You've got to relax with that site, man.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.474
Ah, here we are.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.476
"Short-term, sporadic bleeding

12:07.560 --> 12:09.437
"is generally not due to a period,

12:09.437 --> 12:11.731
but is more indicative of spotting."

12:11.731 --> 12:13.774
Spotting? What's spotting?

12:16.193 --> 12:18.362
Oh, my God, Rupert.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.114
I'm pregnant!

12:20.114 --> 12:21.615
How did this happen?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.033
Ah, what do you care anyway?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
I'm sure you'll do what you always do,

12:24.452 --> 12:26.287
and bury yourself in your work.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.252
I have Stewie on one.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.879
He says he's been trying your cell.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.508
Uh, Stewie, he just
stepped into a meeting.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.218
We'll have to return.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.227
One... two...

12:54.482 --> 12:56.776
This court rules that
the farmer has violated

12:56.776 --> 12:58.903
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.489
The farm hereby belongs to the sheep.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.122
One.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.540
Guys, I can't go to sleep

13:11.624 --> 13:13.459
without watching a <i>Frasier</i> rerun.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.377
Can one of you please tell me a <i>Frasier?</i>

13:15.461 --> 13:17.713
All right. Once upon a time,

13:17.797 --> 13:20.299
Frasier auditioned for a community play...

13:20.299 --> 13:22.468
No, not that one.
One-one where he's with Niles.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.804
That's fair, those are the best ones.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.015
Once upon a time,
Frasier and Niles were invited

13:28.015 --> 13:30.768
to a dinner party and
both brought the same wine.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.396
Look at that, already asleep.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.858
Hmm, guess everyone'e sleeping.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.027
It's just me and you, Mr. Bear.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.738
B-B-B-Bear?!

13:45.366 --> 13:47.910
It's okay, guys, we might
be getting attacked by a bear,

13:47.910 --> 13:50.037
or we might just be on <i>Bear Scares.</i>

13:50.037 --> 13:51.622
What's <i>Bear Scares?</i>

13:51.622 --> 13:54.750
Only Latvia's number-one bear prank show.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.378
Aah!

13:58.420 --> 14:01.048

14:18.566 --> 14:21.569
Oh, no! The bear's going after Quagmire.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.070
Aah!

14:24.113 --> 14:25.781
I'm gonna run behind this tree

14:25.865 --> 14:27.575
and then the bear's gonna drag me out.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.368
Me, and very clearly not a dummy

14:29.368 --> 14:31.078
who he then tosses around.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.165
Aah! Oh, no.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.584
I'm being tossed around.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.797
Oh, God. Now we're
all gonna be tossed around.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.969
Oh, no. Oh no, help.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.554
Make him stop.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.848
Aah! This is the real me!

14:50.848 --> 14:52.808
My dummy's riding a horse!

14:52.892 --> 14:55.060
Giddy-up. Yaw.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.229
Lil Nas X.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.944
Well, glad to see you're
no longer crying on the couch.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.405
Yes, it turns out
I was wrong about my period.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.365
Good. I'm glad you came to your senses.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.159
- Because I'm pregnant.
- I'll pay to get rid of it.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.703
I-I'm sorry that's...
that's just a reflex.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.539
Yes, I freaked out at first, too, but I...

15:15.623 --> 15:17.958
<i>we</i> decided it's for the best.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.252
So, if it's a boy, I'm naming him Timothée

15:20.336 --> 15:22.421
after Timothée Chalamet,
and if it's a girl,

15:22.421 --> 15:25.549
I'm naming her Chalamet
after Timothée Chalamet.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.468
What do you mean you don't like him?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.470
Name another A-list actor who couldn't

15:29.470 --> 15:31.472
sit in the front of a car
because he's too light.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
Stewie, this is ridiculous.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.433
You don't like him either?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.143
For God's sake, he looks like a marionette

15:36.143 --> 15:37.811
who broke loose from his strings.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.897
He's a daintier Eddie Redmayne.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.566
If there's another actor
who you can put in your checked baggage

15:42.650 --> 15:44.985
without going over the limit,
I'd like to hear it.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.528
Damn it, Stewie, you're not pregnant.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
Oh, boy. The dog knows

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
he'll lose attention when the baby comes.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.826
You are the baby! A male baby.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.578
Look, I know all kids

15:54.662 --> 15:56.789
like to play make-believe
and pretend to be adults.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.958
Sometimes they even
convince themselves of it.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.876
Now, you've brought a new twist to this--

16:00.960 --> 16:02.753
I don't want to diminish
how weird this is--

16:02.753 --> 16:04.296
but it's time for it to stop.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.507
Because for God's sake,
you are not pregnant.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.392
Okay, look, I-I didn't
mean to break it to you so harshly.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.143
No, no. I just realized

16:18.227 --> 16:20.896
now that I'm pregnant, I can't eat sushi.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.190
You know what? Fine.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.900
- You're pregnant.
- Thank you.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.944
It's just too bad you're
gonna gain all that weight.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.446
- What?
- When you're pregnant, you gain, like, 30 pounds.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.906
30 pounds?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.950
But I only weigh 15.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.577
Well, no matter.
At least I'll sleep comfortably

16:35.661 --> 16:38.747
and continue to have
the same-sized, not-swollen feet.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.543
But I just bought Thom Browne boots.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.129
I got them for myself as a push present.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.505
Sorry, Stewie.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.841
Enjoy the miracle of life.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.135
Oh, dear. Perhaps being pregnant

16:51.135 --> 16:52.886
will be more difficult than I thought.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.389
And we still have to
plan a gender reveal party.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.474
Okay, would you rather do a cake reveal

16:57.558 --> 16:59.560
or burn Napa to the ground?

17:05.691 --> 17:08.610
Oh, man, that bear kicked our asses.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.946
Well, thank God we're all okay.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.115
<i>Good job, Joe. You stayed positive.</i>

17:13.115 --> 17:15.659
<i>It's why you're the rock of the group.</i>

17:15.743 --> 17:17.411
Wait a minute, where's my cowboy hat?

17:17.411 --> 17:18.787
I think the bear took it.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.997
Who gives a (bleep)?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.331
What the hell, Joe?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.875
I always saw you as the rock of the group.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.043
Damn it!

17:24.043 --> 17:25.586
Don't you see, fellas?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.297
We made a oath to the mayor
to get our manhood back.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.382
And our hats are that manhood.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.676
So, we've got to find that bear
and get it back.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.887
I don't know, that sounds dangerous.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.889
Come on, the whole reason we came here

17:36.889 --> 17:38.724
is 'cause we've turned into cowards.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.893
The mayor wanted us
to finish this cattle drive

17:40.893 --> 17:43.687
like real cowboys,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.272
We'll do it with courage and teamwork.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.732
Who's with me?

17:48.358 --> 17:50.235
Yeah, that's the spirit.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.158
Well, Bri, I'm heading out for sushi
in my new boots.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.327
So I'm guessing you got rid of the baby?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.079
Yes, it was a tough decision.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.164
But today I took a morning-after cocktail

18:02.164 --> 18:04.833
of Flintstones vitamins,
Ovaltine, castor oil,

18:04.917 --> 18:07.127
and a splash of Dr. Pepper, since its name

18:07.211 --> 18:09.505
is both a medical professional
and a vegetable.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.215
Well, I think you made the right decision.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.383
Me too. I'm probably the only person

18:13.467 --> 18:16.595
under 18 ever to say this,
but being pregnant is fun

18:16.595 --> 18:19.223
until it forces you
to make sacrifices in any way.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.142
Uh, yeah, I guess that's an okay takeaway.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.062
I just hope little Timothée
or Chalamet understands.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.147
I think he or she would have grown up

18:27.231 --> 18:28.690
to be a strong woman

18:28.774 --> 18:30.692
or a very weak man.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.113
So, uh, you know that
you were never pregnant, right?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
Yes, I went to the hospital for a sonogram

18:36.115 --> 18:37.991
and got yelled at by an angry nurse.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.285
In case you were wondering
whether she likes nonsense,

18:40.369 --> 18:42.704
she, um... she does not.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.086
I can't believe we
haven't found the bear yet.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.339
I was sure he'd be lured in
by my tax portfolio seminar.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.848
Aah!

19:03.600 --> 19:06.061
Uh-oh. I'm gonna get <i>Revenant-ed.</i>

19:06.145 --> 19:08.021
Remember that movie
we all said was amazing

19:08.105 --> 19:09.565
and then immediately forgot?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.443
Don't worry, Peter, we got this.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.499
- Yeah!
- All right!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.626
And I lassoed his neck
so he can masturbate.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.838
Now give me back my hat,
you son of a bitch.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.423
Good job, fellas.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.216
You really showed me something.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.596
Old Man West?

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
The owner of the ranch?

19:41.972 --> 19:43.640
Peter, this isn't <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

19:43.724 --> 19:45.434
You ever notice
how most <i>Scooby-Doo</i> villains

19:45.434 --> 19:46.894
are small businessmen?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.937
Who doesn't like small businessmen?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.190
Odd choice by the creators.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.609
Sorry to put you boys through the paces,

19:53.609 --> 19:55.903
but I felt like you needed a little nudge

19:55.903 --> 19:57.863
to find your courage.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.616
Here, Peter, you earned this.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.912
Thanks, Mr. Mayor.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.455
I'm gonna wear this hat forever.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.832
Actually, Peter,

20:08.916 --> 20:11.043
the hat chooses you.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.963
<i>If you leave, I won't cry ♪</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:18.217
<i>I won't waste one single day. ♪</i>

20:23.305 --> 20:25.140
Oh, it's good to have you home, Peter.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.391
Thanks.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.893
The ranch was nice,

20:27.893 --> 20:29.561
but I think the big lesson here

20:29.645 --> 20:31.313
is that no experience is worth

20:31.313 --> 20:33.941
- sleeping on the ground.
- Oh, God, no.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.361
And my groin is a raging fire
from one day on a horse.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.405
Kids, don't ever do things
you don't normally do.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.907
You'll just be punished for it.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.243
My blue-collar dad

20:44.243 --> 20:46.578
is hostile to new experiences.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.747
Well, that's Bonnie and Donna.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.332
- I have to go.
- What?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.709
Oh, the mayor also runs a ranch for women

20:52.793 --> 20:55.045
trying to get in touch
with their femininity.
