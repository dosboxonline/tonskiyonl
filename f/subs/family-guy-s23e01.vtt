01:16.951 --> 01:19.119
There's still a few minutes
left in happy hour.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.788
Excuse me, ma'am?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.915
Talk to me, Goose.
Which pilot do you think

01:22.916 --> 01:25.000
is gonna be my rival at Top Gun?

01:25.001 --> 01:26.585
It's probably that guy staring at you

01:26.586 --> 01:28.796
while snapping his gum and spinning a pen.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.464
His name's Iceman,

01:30.465 --> 01:32.800
because that's how he flies. Ice-cold.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.469
Cranks the AC,
heard it's a sweating problem.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.179
Used to be fat or something.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.598
I don't think
this bartender saw me. Ma'am?

01:39.599 --> 01:41.100
Have you figured it out yet?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.060
- Figured what out?
- Who's the best pilot?

01:43.061 --> 01:46.063
I heard Snoopy's pretty good.
Does, like, loops and stuff.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.065
Good luck tomorrow.
You guys are gonna need it.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.109
Come on, Slider, let's get some air.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.276
Hot in here, right?

01:51.277 --> 01:53.237
Oh, now she's wiping down bottles.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.031
She's running out the clock on me.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
Talk to me, Goose.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.122
How much you want to bet
I can sleep with her tonight?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.457
Come on, Mav, I said I wasn't
gonna do one of our sex bets

02:05.458 --> 02:07.835
until my parents left.
Their flight got delayed.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.003
Oh, Goosey.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.755
Hey, you didn't want
to pay for my college,

02:11.756 --> 02:13.507
so now I'm in the horny Navy.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.926

02:49.752 --> 02:51.795
It's an '80s movie, so after ten nos,

02:51.796 --> 02:53.422
I have to be your girlfriend.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.009
I'm Maverick.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.135
What's your boobs' name?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.928
- Charlie.
- That's a boy's name.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.430
So, what brings you to town?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.515
I'm an instructor at Top Gun.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.392
Waitress school, huh? That's cool.

03:05.393 --> 03:08.396
Oh, I bet you talk past
all the girls you meet.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.524
Gentlemen, look around.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.903
You are all in the top 1%
of naval aviators.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.655
You're here because you are
the best of the best.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.199
One of you is here because you won

03:20.200 --> 03:22.075
a silent auction at my kid's school.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.994
I can't believe we land on boats.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.662
So freakin' neat.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.706
Now, part of your training
is going to involve

03:27.707 --> 03:30.083
familiarizing yourself
with enemy aircraft.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.710
Here to talk about that now

03:31.711 --> 03:33.587
is our civilian specialist and TAGREP.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.756
Code name, Charlie.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.924
Hello, class.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.301
Ooh, look, Mav, it's your girlfriend.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.345
Stop talking to me, Goose.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.472
I know a lot of you
don't think a lady belongs

03:43.473 --> 03:45.807
in flight school, so to prove you wrong,

03:45.808 --> 03:47.517
I'm gonna say a lot of names of planes.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.896
F-5. A-4. MiG-23.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.606
I've seen all those planes before.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.149
And I've seen a blimp.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.734
<i>We've</i> seen a blimp.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.945
- Yeah, right.
- Talk to them, Goose.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.988
It's true. We gave it the finger.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.741
Yeah, if you're not
a Goodyear, get out of my sky.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.035
And where exactly did you see this blimp?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.411
That's classified.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.039
I also flew over
a million miles an hour once.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.958
- What? When?
- Also classified.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.794
Oh, he's just saying
"classified" to cover up obvious lies.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.337
No, I'm not. They're all true.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.421
I'm six feet tall.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.208
You mean the crooked line
you made with your foot?

04:53.209 --> 04:54.669
Screw that!

04:59.841 --> 05:01.508
That was our only ball.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.720
All right, all right, sorry, I'll get it.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.156
Damn it!

05:24.157 --> 05:26.909
We might need to send this up
the chain of command.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.872
Men, the Navy is nothing
if we can't play jean shorts,

05:31.873 --> 05:34.041
shiny-guy volleyball. Any ideas?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.125
What if we bomb it?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
Bingo bango.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.800
I got missile lock. Firing.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.100
Yeah! Thanks, taxpayers.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.226
Game on.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.645
Oh, here come the fish.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.237
Wow, that was some good teacher sex.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.782
Hey, sorry I yelled, "Talk to me, Goose"
when I finished.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.034
Well, I know we've only known
each other for a few days,

06:09.035 --> 06:10.577
and that you've publicly undermined me

06:10.578 --> 06:12.746
in front of everyone, but I think

06:12.747 --> 06:14.373
I'm falling for you, Mav.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.750
And once I get approval
from the elders at my church,

06:16.751 --> 06:18.043
and you're properly vetted,

06:18.044 --> 06:20.170
I think I'll be falling for you, too.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.297
I'm just worried about you.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.508
You need to start playing by the rules.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.802
If I cared about rules,
I wouldn't be lying

06:26.803 --> 06:29.096
in this bed dry-crusted to your bedsheets.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.348
That's why
I gave you the wet wipe.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.933
You got nothing to worry about, babe.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.560
Goose isn't gonna die
like in my very vivid dream,

06:35.561 --> 06:38.105
and you for sure won't be left
out of the second movie.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.315
- What?
- What?

06:44.153 --> 06:47.197
So, Charlie, you and Mav
are pretty serious, huh?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.658
I heard he pooped
at your house last night.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.742
What?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.119
I've known him for a long time,

06:52.120 --> 06:54.037
and he does not just poop anywhere.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.164
He's very particular.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.916
Because Navy toilets don't have doors.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.126
You learn to hold it.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.877
Goose, can I talk to you a sec?

07:00.878 --> 07:02.796
Did you tell your wife I had a BM?

07:02.797 --> 07:06.258
Unless you are a fool,
that boy is in love with you.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.344
Oh, I like him,
but he also keeps spitting out

07:09.345 --> 07:11.388
random facts about L. Ron Hubbard.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.764
Little bit of a red flag.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.101
Did you know L. Ron Hubbard
was the youngest ever Eagle Scout?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.394
I don't know if that's true.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.812
Suppressive person!

07:18.813 --> 07:20.856
It'll be nice to have
another wife in the group,

07:20.857 --> 07:24.568
especially for that
second movie we'll all definitely be in.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.945
Hey, Goose, take me to bed

07:26.946 --> 07:28.947
or lose me forever!

07:28.948 --> 07:31.032
Just so you know, if you do
want to lose her forever,

07:31.033 --> 07:33.244
my church is really good at that.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.429
Bogey is two miles, headed away.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.931
Ready to engage.
You know, if we're gonna win this thing,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.578
I want you to know, when he died,

09:39.579 --> 09:40.996
we were more than five miles out,

09:40.997 --> 09:43.415
so I could have done anything
I wanted with his body,

09:43.416 --> 09:44.541
but I didn't.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.376

10:14.947 --> 10:16.364
just like him one day.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.867
- You think so?
- I know so.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.135
Maverick, I'm sorry about Goose.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.638
Everybody liked him.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.349
Smells like balls in here.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.309
Let's get ready to fly now!

10:44.310 --> 10:46.645
- I quit.
- What? Are you serious?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.022
Yeah. All I ever wanted was to be a pilot,

10:49.023 --> 10:50.106
but now I think I want to be a guy

10:50.107 --> 10:51.733
who turns on roller coasters.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.401
It looks easy, and I can do it drunk.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.028
I know you're sad about Goose,

10:55.029 --> 10:56.571
but you're too good a pilot to quit.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.406
And we need your help
for a special mission

10:58.407 --> 11:00.492
against an unnamed country
who's our enemy.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.077
Ooh, I hate those guys.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.037
Yeah, what they did was not okay.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.039
What do you say? Will you fly?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.041
No. I'm too sad about Goose,

11:08.042 --> 11:10.711
so I'm gonna go sulk
in some of my other movies for a while.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.678
You want answers?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.931
- I want the Goose!
- You can't handle the Goose!

11:22.932 --> 11:25.892
Show me the money!

11:25.893 --> 11:27.018
Talk to me, Goose.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.439
I think I might have the wrong number!

11:31.065 --> 11:33.817
Hey, what's the weight limit
on these lower-y things, Goose?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.319
May I have the password, please?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.822
- "Talk to me, Goose"?
- No, that's not it.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.448
- "Goose, talk to me"?
- No.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.284
- It's something with "Goose."
- It's not. You must leave.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.328
Can I please stay for the sex party?

11:45.329 --> 11:48.416
I already Binaca'd
my stuff like the sign on the wall said.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.043
- "The Goose is loose."
- Go!

11:53.379 --> 11:54.879
Okay, I'm done being sad,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.132
and I'm ready for
the big final mission now.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.968
Maverick? We flew that mission
35 years ago.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.137
You've been sulking for three decades.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.472
Oh. So, is this still <i>Top Gun?</i>

12:04.473 --> 12:06.349
No. This is <i>Top Gun: Maverick.</i>

12:06.350 --> 12:08.435
It's completely different
and exactly the same.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.602
I'm glad you're back.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.730
Yet another unnamed country
that is our enemy

12:11.731 --> 12:13.106
is planning something big.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.108
Oh. [growls] Them.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.445
We need you to help train
a new crop of pilots for the mission.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.780
I appreciate the offer, sir,
but I can't accept.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.865
I understand.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.992
Then we'll need to take back
your Navy-issued lifts

12:23.993 --> 12:25.744
that make you everyone else's height.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.328
No, no, no, that... No, no,
that-- No, that's fine.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.997
- I... I can, I can teach.
- Good.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.957
Oh, there's one other thing
you should know.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.753
One of the pilots you'll be training
is Goose's son.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.006
Who's Goose?

12:38.007 --> 12:39.799
What? Goose.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.968
The guy you just spent 35 years mourning.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.553
Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, Goose.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.473
Yeah, oh, wow, brain toot.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.058
Yeah, thanks for the heads-up.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.814
Welcome to <i>Top Gun: Maverick.</i>

12:54.815 --> 12:57.692
Our mission, destroy
a uranium enrichment plant

12:57.693 --> 12:59.903
in that unnamed country that is our enemy.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.863
Man, I want to cream those guys!

13:01.864 --> 13:04.199
To complete this mission, I propose we fly

13:04.200 --> 13:06.868
at a low altitude,
undetected through a canyon,

13:06.869 --> 13:08.161
then destroy the target.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.622
All in under two and a half minutes.
Questions?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.166
Yeah, this mission seems really similar

13:13.167 --> 13:14.626
to the one in <i>Star Wars.</i>

13:14.627 --> 13:16.795
People can fly low and shoot a small thing

13:16.796 --> 13:18.338
without it being a <i>Star Wars.</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:20.048
Yeah, but the text
on the screen even says,

13:20.049 --> 13:21.633
"Womp rat-sized target."

13:21.634 --> 13:23.259
Don't look at the screen.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.512
Any other questions not about <i>Star Wars?</i>

13:25.513 --> 13:27.138
Why'd you kill my dad?

13:27.139 --> 13:29.516
- No more questions!
- Do you do your own stunts?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.767
Well, maybe one more.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.143
As a matter of fact, I do.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.269
Had you not heard that?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.646
Anyway, I'm gonna fly the mission.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.147
You're all cut except for Goose's son.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.565
So why are we even here?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.317
Only stunt questions from you, Bob.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.736
I'm Bob?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.704
Iceman.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.414
Ah, it's good to see you again.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.167
We have so many memories together.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.799
Anyway, I need your advice.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.175
If I don't pick Rooster for the mission,

14:04.176 --> 14:06.052
he's never gonna forgive me
for everything.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.554
But I'm afraid he's not ready.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.056
What should I do?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.371
Thanks, Iceman.
I knew you'd know what to do.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.208
So, are you all silent and scarfed
because you're dying?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.001
No, is that what people are saying?

14:38.002 --> 14:40.378
No, I'm just on vocal rest
for karaoke later.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.130
I'm 100% totally fine.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.339
I've never felt better in my li--

14:43.340 --> 14:45.926
Aw, he died.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.529
Five miles to target.
Try to keep up, Rooster.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.031
Not gonna be a problem.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.116
Let's keep the small talk to a minimum.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.368
Got it.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.787
So, how's your dad doing, good?

15:14.788 --> 15:15.914
You killed him.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.832
Yeah, and I was more than five miles out,

15:17.833 --> 15:20.084
and I could have done anything
with his body, but I didn't.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.794
Yeah, the more you say that,

15:21.795 --> 15:23.547
the more I don't think it's true.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.091
Are you angry at me
for pulling your papers

15:27.092 --> 15:28.551
from the Naval Academy?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.428
'Cause I've already
forgiven myself for that.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.264
I had a whole scene with Iceman
and Iceman's computer about it.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.517
This is about everything,
my dad, the papers.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.228
And why'd you write my mom
out of the sequel?

15:39.229 --> 15:40.313
It's complicated.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.232
There's scheduling conflicts
and different creative visions,

15:43.233 --> 15:45.068
and it wouldn't be fair to her

15:45.069 --> 15:47.320
to use her in a way that's
inorganic to the narrative.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.864
Inorganic? I should be 40 years old,

15:49.865 --> 15:51.574
but somehow I'm, like, 20?

15:51.575 --> 15:53.201
Oh, people don't care about those details,

15:53.202 --> 15:56.080
as long as you have loud jets
and America kicking ass.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.145
That was awesome!

16:21.146 --> 16:22.731
Hey, let's take a selfie to celebrate.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.361
This is totally main-feed material.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.948
Maverick, no!

16:37.871 --> 16:40.331
Oh, no! We lost 'em.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.167
They's gone, sir.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.961
Well, I know it's only 12:15,

16:44.962 --> 16:47.922
but that's all we had to do today, so...

16:47.923 --> 16:49.967
long weekend!

16:57.307 --> 16:59.435
Aw, one of my AirPods fell out.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.106
Rooster!

17:12.114 --> 17:14.282
Do you think I took that missile

17:14.283 --> 17:15.783
so you could be down here with me?

17:15.784 --> 17:17.910
You should be back at the carrier by now.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.787
I was trying to save you.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.331
No, I was trying to save you.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.624
Look, I'm sorry, Rooster.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.835
For your dad, for pulling your papers,

17:25.836 --> 17:28.337
and for signing you up for
Gavin Newsom's text messages.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.591
I responded "STOP"
and it just wouldn't stop.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.801
Why were you doing all these things?

17:33.802 --> 17:35.845
To protect you. At first.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.764
Then I kind of got addicted to the idea

17:37.765 --> 17:40.851
of controlling every minute
detail of a person's life.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.898
Get down, Mav!

17:47.483 --> 17:50.068
I also replaced your weapons
with gender reveal things.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.904
That is the last thing, though, I swear.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.699
Aw.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.540
Hello, Maverick.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.126
You guys are the bad guys? Why?

18:07.127 --> 18:08.461
Why do you think?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.421
We were important parts
of that first movie,

18:10.422 --> 18:12.548
and you just tossed all the women aside.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.842
Yet you somehow figured out
how to keep in a guy

18:14.843 --> 18:16.469
who's literally unable to speak.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.138
This is all a big misunderstanding,
and I can fix it.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.224
They're talking about doing
another <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

18:21.225 --> 18:23.768
How would you like to be
the fat head kid's grandma?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.020
And you can be <i>Minority Report's</i> grandma.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.855
I got grandma parts for all of you.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.483
How come you get to be
a 60-year-old action star

18:30.484 --> 18:31.943
and we have to be grandmas?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.361
We can do action, too, you know.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.446
And we're gonna prove it right now.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.324
Let me just put on
my reading glasses, hold on.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.742
Wait. You're right.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.536
You both brought up some painful memories,

18:41.537 --> 18:42.662
or engrams.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.039
What if I told you that,
through a series of audits,

18:45.040 --> 18:47.416
I can help you go clear
and liberate the thetan

18:47.417 --> 18:49.377
trapped inside your astral shell?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.087
Is that like horoscopes?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.214
It is kind of like stars and space stuff.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.675
Yeah, if you want,
I can go grab an E-meter from my plane.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.426
You know, I have been feeling a little off

18:57.427 --> 18:58.803
since the last half-moon.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.055
Okay, be quick.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.227
- I can't believe they fell for that crap.
- Oh, yeah, such crap,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.438
definitely not something
I've left two families over.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.898
What are you doing, Mav?

19:10.899 --> 19:12.441
I'm getting us out of here.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.777
You sure this old thing can even fly?

19:14.778 --> 19:15.862
It's not that old.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.573
Look at its full head
of log cabin brown hair.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.950
I know horoscopes are a little flimflammy,

19:20.951 --> 19:22.870
but people act like
they're fortune cookies...

19:24.621 --> 19:27.374
Damn it, they're stealing
that very young plane!

19:33.881 --> 19:35.757
We're never gonna lose 'em in this thing.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.103
We can't take much more of this.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.188
We're gonna have to eject.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.939
I'm gonna climb,
then we'll eject on three.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.108
On three or after three?

19:54.109 --> 19:56.278
You're just like your stupid father.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.200
Take the shot.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.210
Iceman! He's alive!

20:12.211 --> 20:14.545
Yay! Saved by a guy!

20:30.854 --> 20:32.730
It's good to have my wingman back.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.898
I thought we lost you.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.733
Nope. I'm as healthy as I've ever--

20:35.734 --> 20:37.653
Aw, he died again.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.614
Well, that was pretty fun.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.282
<i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> went on to make

20:43.283 --> 20:45.618
over a billion dollars at the box office.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.786
You know what that means?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.287
People are going to the movies again.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.039
Isn't that right, Tiny Tom Cruise?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.417
That's right, Peter. Now let's jump!

20:53.043 --> 20:54.168
Why are we jumping again?

20:54.169 --> 20:56.087
So people will watch your stuff,

20:56.088 --> 20:57.838
and because I don't know
I'm not in a movie

20:57.839 --> 20:59.466
all the time.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.634
You do your own stunts?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.886
Oh, yeah, were you not aware of that?
