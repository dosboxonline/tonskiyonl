WEBVTT

00:28.840 --> 00:31.760
Welcome at the Costa Blanca,

00:31.840 --> 00:35.920
where we, the retirees,
can enjoy our old age,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.600
the sun and the peace and quiet.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.080
Where we look back on our past,

00:43.160 --> 00:45.720
the fruits of our hard work.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.120
And I worked damn hard.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.040
I missed you so much.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.520
Don't forget: I come from nothing.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.120
-Ferry!
-Let her go!

01:01.200 --> 01:02.080
Shoot then!

01:02.160 --> 01:05.000
I had nothing, I got nothing.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.960
Only hunger and bruises.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.040
Never threaten anyone
if you can't finish it.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.280
I swore then that neither I,
nor any Bouman after me,

01:14.360 --> 01:15.960
would experience that misery again.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.240
It's time to choose, Ferry.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.960
Will you stay small
or take what's rightfully yours?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.400
And I have chosen.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.920
Yeah, beer for everyone!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.760
I became the biggest.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.400
I had everything.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.080
I built a tight-knit family.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.000
Together with Daan, the love of my life.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.080
-Do you want to marry me?
-I'd love to.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.400
We're getting married!

01:46.360 --> 01:48.560
And we had loads of money.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.240
Not bad, right,
for a small self-employed businessman?

01:52.320 --> 01:57.360
Zonnedauw was our kingdom
and I was king of the campsite.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.000
Well, what a kingdom…

02:01.080 --> 02:06.920
My sister Claudia died, way too soon.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.280
Her daughter Sonja got
the same fucking disease.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.960
What have you been up to this time?

02:12.560 --> 02:16.960
Her daughter Jezebel had to grow up
without a father anyway.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.000
I don't like talking about that.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.360
Jurgen was your responsibility, John.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.000
-I'll find out what happened.
-You will sort it out.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.160
Is that what Ferry thinks?
Fuck, man, fuck!

02:28.240 --> 02:32.280
I would never do such a thing, John!
you know that!

02:33.760 --> 02:37.400
I miss you so much, Daddy.
Where did you go?

02:38.160 --> 02:42.280
I tried to take care of my clan,
but I lost everyone.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.360
Marco…

02:46.040 --> 02:47.200
Lars…

02:47.800 --> 02:48.760
Remco…

02:49.760 --> 02:51.280
Even John.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.280
No one could take what I had.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.680
But the more I wanted to win,
the more I lost. Even Danielle.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.320
I never want to see you again.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.160
And the rest was taken by the police,
thanks to Dennis.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.280
Tell me where those pills are
and Ferry will never get to you.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.840
Goddammit.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.600
I have nothing left, just the Spanish sun.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.320
Very warm.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.360
No, Ferry Bouman no longer exists.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.960
André?

03:32.280 --> 03:33.320
What?

03:40.120 --> 03:43.040
-André, André!
-Yeah, yeah…

03:43.120 --> 03:47.400
André, André, André!

03:49.320 --> 03:50.720
Alright.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.080
Come on, hurry!

03:54.160 --> 03:56.400
Hey André, can we hire you as a clown?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.160
That's what your wives did last night.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.240
-Hello, Santa Claus. Welcome to the party.
-Hello. Thank you.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.640
Ho, ho, ho.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.040
Bravo, let me take a look at you.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.560
Fantastic.
No Christmas without Santa Claus.

04:17.640 --> 04:21.800
-This stupid beard…
-Don't complain so much.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.480
Hand out candies to the children.

04:26.240 --> 04:32.640
Maybe dinner tonight?
The leftovers from the barbecue?

04:32.720 --> 04:36.560
No, I'm sorry. I will be with my family.
Another time.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.160
More for me.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.360
Well, who wants candy? Hey!

04:45.440 --> 04:47.880
And a bit more in that direction!

04:47.960 --> 04:50.960
Great! Next.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.640
That was really bad.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.480
Yeah, that way it's easy.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.480
Three shots, I'm first.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.000
Let's take a look at the next hole.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.160
Goddammit.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.640
Yes, hole-in-one!
André's in the lead again.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
Hey!

05:20.440 --> 05:21.760
Be careful!

05:23.160 --> 05:24.480
The Grinch.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.760
What did you say?

05:28.640 --> 05:30.040
That's what I thought.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.200
Hey.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.200
What's going on?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.480
Nothing.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.960
-Nothing?
-No. Jez?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.400
Ferry.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.840
Jezebel?

06:03.440 --> 06:06.760
-How did you get here?
-On foot.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.160
Hello to you too.
It's been a long time, Jezebel.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.160
How are you? Good to see you.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.240
Of course. Hey. Goddammit.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.840
How are you?

06:22.400 --> 06:26.840
You have a damn good hiding place here.
We searched every campsite in Benidorm.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.560
Yeah, well… You found me, didn't you?

06:29.640 --> 06:30.840
André?

06:31.440 --> 06:32.720
What?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.680
Hello.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.200
Is this your daughter?

06:38.280 --> 06:43.120
No, she's the daughter
of my sister's daughter.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.520
Are they looking for a place to stay?

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
It's okay.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.520
-The children want Santa Claus back.
-Yes, I'm coming.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.840
André?

06:58.920 --> 07:03.240
Have you ever googled Ferry Bouman?
Come in.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.880
Something to drink?

07:11.960 --> 07:16.960
I've got orange juice, coke, milk.
There's no more chocolate milk.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.880
Just give me a beer.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.240
And for him?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.320
-Jer, something to drink?
-What?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.280
-A drink?
-No.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.200
Jer?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.520
Jeremy, my boyfriend.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.120
How long has it been?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.360
Eight years.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.760
Yeah…

07:47.280 --> 07:48.400
How are you?

07:51.280 --> 07:52.800
I need money.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.120
Who doesn't?

07:57.120 --> 08:00.960
Consider it backpay for missed presents
over the years.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.880
How much do you need?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.440
Fifty thousand.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.240
Fifty thousand?

08:18.680 --> 08:22.320
-What's going on here?
-Do you even care?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.040
Hey…

08:29.080 --> 08:30.240
What's going on?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.360
Don't you know how to speak, or what?

08:35.680 --> 08:36.760
Hey!

08:41.280 --> 08:43.440
-We lost a downpayment.
-Shut your mouth!

08:43.520 --> 08:45.120
Downpayment for what?

08:48.400 --> 08:49.520
XTC.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.080
XTC…

08:56.680 --> 08:58.480
-You sell XTC?
-Yeah, so what?

08:58.560 --> 09:00.960
Yeah, so what? How dumb are you?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.400
You were the biggest pill dealer
in Brabant.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.640
So? How do you get those pills?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.240
Jer is our cook.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.600
-Did you get her into this, goddammit?
-Ferry, let him go!

09:14.680 --> 09:17.640
-No, man!
-Boy, give me this, you idiot.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.000
-Before you shoot off your own balls.
-It's not his fault.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.800
What happened to that downpayment?

09:25.840 --> 09:28.360
We bought a lab with it, and PMK.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.680
Where is the lab?

09:31.480 --> 09:32.800
Taken by the cops.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.200
This keeps getting better.
Are you kidding me now?

09:39.280 --> 09:41.600
-Do you see me laugh?
-Do you see me laugh, punk?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.840
Fuck you, scrotum.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.280
Do you realize the mess you're in?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.720
I want nothing to do with this.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.360
I'm not asking you to. Dude,
just give me the money and I'll leave.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.480
To do what? Buy a new lab?

09:55.560 --> 09:59.240
-A lab, PMK.
-You will pay that downpayment back.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.160
Lend me the money. I'll pay you back.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.640
I don't have money. Look around you.

10:05.840 --> 10:10.720
-Told you that selfish ass wouldn't help.
-Hey, I don't owe you anything.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.720
So where have you been all this time?

10:22.800 --> 10:26.480
I had no one left. Idiot.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.880
I don't know how you see it,
but you owe me a lot.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.080
André?

10:36.280 --> 10:40.000
Do you really think you'll cure your
problems with cocktails in the sun?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.400
My problems? Your problems.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.200
-André?!
-I have nothing to do with this.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.320
Fuck you, Ferry!

10:50.400 --> 10:51.920
The name is André.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.080
André, in Spain Santa Claus doesn't drink.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.040
This Santa is very thirsty.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.280
Ferry?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.240
-You have to help us.
-Get out of here.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.480
We promised the pills.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.400
To Lex. Lex van Dun.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.760
Two hundred fifty thousand.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.520
So you're bothering me for 250,000 pills?

11:52.120 --> 11:55.760
When we asked for more time, he lost it.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.240
He gave Jez a beating.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.800
Badly.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.080
You should have done something then,
instead of crying about it here.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.160
You don't know Lex.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.360
He's completely mental.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.080
I'm done with that stuff.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.160
Put it on my bill.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.640
-André, André.
-What is it, kid?

12:23.720 --> 12:26.440
-More candy.
-More candy?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.440
Shouldn't you just go
and play football with your friends?

12:30.520 --> 12:34.520
Or you'll get as fat as André
and you don't want that, do you?

12:36.800 --> 12:38.520
What's your name again?

12:39.360 --> 12:40.800
Jonnie.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.640
Jonnie.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.400
That's a nice name, kid.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.400
Goddammit.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.640
-Where are your manners?
-Chill, old man.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.920
-Or should I teach you some?
-Hey! Hey, are you insane?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
-Get lost, man!
-Let go of my son!

13:02.080 --> 13:03.440
Get lost! Go away!

13:03.520 --> 13:04.560
Easy!

13:05.160 --> 13:06.040
André!

13:08.240 --> 13:11.680
Let me go! Let go!

13:11.760 --> 13:14.480
Get off! Go!

13:26.560 --> 13:27.720
I'm sorry.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.040
Goddammit.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.440
Fuck. You need a ticket for this thing.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.680
-Do you see one?
-I don't know.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.480
Shit.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.640
Out of the way. Move!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.160
Goddammit.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.560
-Ferry…
-Shut up!

14:58.320 --> 15:00.960
Henk, it's Ferry.

15:01.040 --> 15:05.200
-Ferry? Which Ferry?
-What do you mean? Do you know any other?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.720
-Where have you been?
-Listen…

15:08.600 --> 15:10.360
What do you know about Lex van Dun?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.440
Van Dun…

15:14.160 --> 15:15.680
Stay away from him, Ferry.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.760
That guy is insane.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.680
You promised me something.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.600
For real. He's completely off the rails.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.880
You'll get all of it, I swear.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.560
He'd torture his own mother.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.760
Lex, no!

15:37.760 --> 15:39.880
It's not like it used to be.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.000
Nowadays, no one is fair anymore.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.720
-Heavy stuff.
-Yes, the crazies are running the kingdom.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.960
-Okay.
-It's all shitty, Fer.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.280
Thank you.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.800
We're leaving.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.840
Where to?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.080
Home.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.600
Put that away. It's not a toy. Dammit.

16:31.240 --> 16:36.360
I may be dragging you back into the pills,
but I'm saving you from that campsite.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.240
You're not dragging me into anything.

16:39.320 --> 16:44.080
I'm helping you out of that mess
and then I'm gone.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.360
Goddammit, man. Idiot.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.680
I'll do the talking.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.000
You keep your mouth shut.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.360
-Kiddo…
-Fuck you.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.280
Shut up.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.640
Yeah?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.680
Is that bodyguard supposed to scare me?

18:06.160 --> 18:07.520
Are you Lex?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.960
-I'm Ferry.
-Bouman.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.960
I thought you were dead.
What are you doing here?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.400
Jezebel is family.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.720
Jezebel…

18:23.560 --> 18:25.520
Did you go crying to Uncle Ferry?

18:27.320 --> 18:28.560
So we're in business now?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.480
-No.
-No?

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
Is not going to happen.

18:32.640 --> 18:37.160
Those pills are not coming. You get
your downpayment back, and that's it.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.360
I don't care about that downpayment.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.120
I promised someone those pills
and I value my reputation more.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.360
Yeah?

18:44.440 --> 18:47.760
You should have thought about that
before going into business with kids.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.160
Ferry?

18:56.200 --> 18:59.600
I should kill you right here,
you fucking bastard.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.520
-Haven't you done enough?
-Do you know who he is?

19:04.320 --> 19:08.000
I did three years because of him.
He'll screw you all over.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.160
One doesn't betray one's friends,
right, Dennis?

19:17.480 --> 19:21.160
Shame. On. You.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.200
Shame on you? You think that's normal?

19:26.280 --> 19:29.840
He wouldn't dare do that to me.
Right, Dennis?

19:31.520 --> 19:35.840
-He belongs with me now.
-So much for your big reputation.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.120
Yes, and that's why I'm respecting yours.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.280
So one more time.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.400
I need those pills, within a week.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.560
I'm not risking my life for 250,000 pills.

19:50.640 --> 19:54.120
Double it, or nothing happens at all.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.360
Jesus, I love this guy.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.680
Okay.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.160
Five hundred K?

20:02.680 --> 20:04.840
I'll pay for everything.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.680
Half a million for half a million.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.280
You have a week.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.680
Deal.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.440
And if you don't deliver, I'll kill you.

20:24.680 --> 20:29.000
They've tried that before. Ask Dennis.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.600
Dennis…

20:54.640 --> 20:56.240
I asked for small fry.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.520
-That's what she is.
-But attached to a whale, right?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.640
Fucking Ferry Bouman!

21:04.720 --> 21:07.400
I want my pills. Get them some PMK. Now!

21:10.320 --> 21:14.800
-Why didn't you tell me about Dennis?
-Because I knew you'd react this way.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.600
How else?
We lost everything because of that jerk.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.960
So it's "we" now.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.800
How dumb are you to trust that asshole?!

21:23.880 --> 21:26.320
-Hey, don't call me dumb!
-Keep out of it!

21:26.400 --> 21:30.000
At least Dennis was there when Mom died.
He took care of me.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.560
By connecting you to Lex?

21:31.640 --> 21:34.720
-By giving us a way to build capital.
-Capital?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.840
Go work at a ticket office, please.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.400
I had nothing. Now I have a future.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.800
-Some future.
-Thanks to Dennis I have something.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.760
Something, yeah! Loads of shit!

21:44.840 --> 21:47.360
Yes, and you got us deeper into it.

21:47.960 --> 21:52.040
We have no lab,
we have no PMK, we have nothing.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.120
Good luck with those pills.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.720
Fucking hell.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.040
Does she always nag like that?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.480
Only when family is visiting.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.400
You're lucky it's me, boy.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.480
If her grandmother was still alive,
she'd cut your balls off.

22:19.360 --> 22:23.080
We don't want kids anyway.
Not that it's any of your business.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.920
-No?
-Not your business, no.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.040
No, I mean children.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.400
Never mind.

22:33.320 --> 22:38.520
I get it.
Jezebel has bigger balls than you.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.040
What's the obsession with my balls?

22:42.120 --> 22:45.400
She's waiting for a man
who can actually to protect her.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.840
What good does it do a little one
when there's no money?

22:48.920 --> 22:52.920
But, again, that's not your business,
neither her choice nor my balls.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.960
There will be money soon, you dipshit.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.240
Are you still angry, Uncle?

22:59.120 --> 23:03.720
Weren't you going to get us out of this,
before you doubled the deal?

23:03.800 --> 23:08.600
If I'm going to get my hands dirty,
I want as big a bag of money as possible.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.160
Oh boy, how much does
a glass of sangria cost nowadays?

23:12.960 --> 23:16.360
You wanted to "build capital", right?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.200
That's why you played the gangster game.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.960
But all right, here he is, hey.
The biggest pill dealer in Brabant.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.200
Yes. And the shittiest family
in the world.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.840
If we want to finish making 500,000 pills,
we better get started, no?

23:34.920 --> 23:39.000
Yeah, without PMK, without a lab.
Let's go.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.840
Uncle Ferry might have something.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.320
What the fuck?

23:56.520 --> 23:57.880
This is junk.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.000
It made better pills
than you have ever seen.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.000
They were lining up for them
all the way to Sydney.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.680
Sydney, that's in Australia.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.400
Fuck you.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.520
-What is this old shit?
-Fine antiques.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.120
You have no alternative,
so you'll have to make do with it.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.880
How did you get the PMK last time?

24:24.560 --> 24:25.920
The dark web.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.040
That's online.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.680
ZONNEDAUW CAMPSITE
VACATION FOR EVERYONE

24:46.280 --> 24:48.560
THE GREEN RESIDENCE OF TOMORROW
80% SOLD

25:25.680 --> 25:29.880
-Whoa, Ferry Bouman.
-Ferry motherfucking Bouman. What?

25:29.960 --> 25:33.640
Hey, G, you're the reason I do what I do.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.040
Don't do that.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.960
This is Steve and Dino.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.840
We're in this together.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.800
-Steve and Dino.
-Yes.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Sounds like a TV show for kids.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.480
-Ferry, you're a legend.
-It's an honor to meet you.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We need PMK.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.280
For 500,000 pills.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.800
-What?
-Are we done or not?

25:57.320 --> 25:59.240
Well, the cops have our PMK.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.800
The cops?

26:02.600 --> 26:04.880
What do we do? Ring the bell?

26:04.960 --> 26:07.560
No, break in.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.080
Yeah, that's literally what we did.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.520
We made a hole through a fence
around the police and fire department.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.360
And inside we found our lab and PMK.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.640
They set it up to train new cops.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.960
I know the way. I even drew a map.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.760
And what then?
Casually walk out with that stuff?

26:27.840 --> 26:29.800
We're not breaking in
at the police station.

26:29.880 --> 26:34.080
Not now, not tomorrow, not ever.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.200
Can I borrow your phone?
I have to call Lars.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.680
Do you want me to fix it or not?

26:44.560 --> 26:47.800
Fucking kindergarten… Oh, boy.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.400
-Hello?
-Yes?

27:23.040 --> 27:26.160
Lars, it's me. How are you?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.360
Not much left of your palace.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.200
You got some nerve to come here, man.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.640
He can take care of the PMK.
He's on our side.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.280
Don't be so naive.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
He'll turn when it suits him.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.840
You got any more time to waste?

27:54.920 --> 27:58.440
For you? I only need one second, man.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.680
Knock it off, now.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.520
It's either this
or breaking in with the police.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.280
-Leave us alone.
-Yeah, right.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.400
It's fine, Jez. He's all bark.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.280
After I cleaned up your mess here

28:20.360 --> 28:23.800
and if Lex hasn't killed you yet,
I'll do it.

28:23.880 --> 28:28.040
Just get to work. And then go back
to your cave. You have nothing left.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.520
-Ferry!
-I'm coming to get you, man.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.520
Are you okay?

28:35.400 --> 28:38.760
Goddamn. Fucking mess.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.080
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Fuck.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.080
There's PMK in that warehouse.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.560
There's one camera at the side entrance.
You can turn it.

28:55.640 --> 29:00.400
And then? Walk in and look for a barrel
that has PMK written on it?

29:00.480 --> 29:03.800
Time is of the essence.
This is not the time to be a coward.

29:03.880 --> 29:07.960
You have to think.
Be smarter than the others.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.880
How long were you in prison?

29:10.960 --> 29:13.160
Yeah, thanks to that piss stain
over there.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.240
Okay, so how do we get in?

29:19.840 --> 29:22.560
-We're not.
-What do you mean, we're not?

29:23.440 --> 29:27.320
Let me talk.
First we need two pick-up trucks.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.280
I know a place where we can steal those.

29:30.920 --> 29:31.960
Oh, okay.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.920
We'll go to the warehouse,
push that camera away,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
break open the door…

29:40.840 --> 29:44.800
and then we'll need some tires.
We'll light them on fire to get smoke.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.280
A lot of smoke.
We'll throw those into the building.

29:49.400 --> 29:55.040
When there's smoke everywhere,
the people will have to come out.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.280
All we have to do is wait.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.520
-Such a dumb idea.
-Patience.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.240
The cops will be here soon.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.680
It'll be fine.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.720
Drive.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.200
Wait.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.760
Go.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.960
Get out, come on! Get out!

31:36.040 --> 31:39.000
On your knees or I'll blow your head off!

31:41.440 --> 31:42.480
Hurry up!

31:52.680 --> 31:53.680
Go!

31:56.880 --> 31:58.160
What the fuck, Jez!

31:59.280 --> 32:01.280
-Jez!
-Fuck it.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
Hey!

32:07.000 --> 32:09.520
Load it up! Come on, more barrels!

32:09.600 --> 32:10.680
Damn it!

32:11.760 --> 32:15.120
Lay down! Lay down, head down
and don't look up!

32:15.800 --> 32:18.240
What the fuck! What are you doing?!

32:18.320 --> 32:20.040
Are you crazy?! Drive!

32:20.120 --> 32:21.400
-Hurry up!
-Drive!

32:26.200 --> 32:27.320
Jer?!

32:28.040 --> 32:29.280
Jeremy!

32:31.560 --> 32:32.520
Shit!

32:35.520 --> 32:36.440
Drive!

32:58.080 --> 32:59.560
Hey, hurry up.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.760
-What the fuck happened?
-Is he okay?

33:04.840 --> 33:07.840
-Hey, lean on me. Are you okay?
-Holy shit.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Be careful. Be careful!

33:11.080 --> 33:13.520
-It'll be fine. I'm here.
-This way.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.040
-Three, two, one.
-Watch out.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.240
-Make way. Get lost.
-He needs a hospital.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.880
With a bullet in his shoulder?
The cops will come.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.400
Heat this up, and come right away
when I call you. Hurry up.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.480
Okay, man, we're going to take a look.
Don't whine.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.240
Let me check.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.040
Hold him down.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.400
Jezebel!

34:37.360 --> 34:38.520
What the fuck happened?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.800
Hey, Ferry.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.080
Hey.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.280
-What the fuck happened, Bouman?
-Bouman?

34:51.800 --> 34:54.800
-We took some more barrels.
-Whose fucking idea was that?

34:54.880 --> 34:56.600
-Does it matter?
-Tell that to Jeremy.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.920
-I thought we had a plan.
-Shut up! Both of you!

35:01.880 --> 35:06.280
Sometimes things change. If you
can't take that, go cry to your mom.

35:07.880 --> 35:11.560
We need a location to cook. Any ideas?

35:11.640 --> 35:13.040
I know someone.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.680
Get on with it then.
Stop whining. Fucking toddlers.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.560
Fuck.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.560
Thanks.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.280
How stupid are you?

35:30.480 --> 35:32.200
We said three barrels.

35:34.240 --> 35:37.920
I was already thinking of the next deal.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.680
That was thinking?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.840
You are reckless.

35:42.920 --> 35:46.600
You can do that after I'm gone,
but you're not risking my life again.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.200
Goddammit.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.640
Grandpa had the other half. It got lost.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.920
How is he?

36:33.880 --> 36:38.480
Hey, sometimes one makes decisions
one regrets later on.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.800
Look at that. There he is.

36:46.080 --> 36:50.080
-How are you, kid? Are you ready?
-Yes.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.480
He can't cook like this.
We can ask Dennis.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.720
Stop it.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.760
The bullet is out.
It's happened to me too. It's nothing.

37:01.840 --> 37:06.880
A few paracetamol and there we go.
You'll get to be a real man, boy.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.080
I'll wait outside.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.160
The clock's ticking!

37:25.400 --> 37:26.480
Are we over now?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.800
You can't leave me alone right now.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.200
Are you saying sorry?

37:45.720 --> 37:49.480
Yo, come on!
We're going on a little cruise.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.240
Dumb and Dumber over here… It's
a miracle this thing is still afloat, man.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.240
Well…

38:21.400 --> 38:22.760
Looks good, doesn't it?

38:26.240 --> 38:27.640
Here we go again.

39:09.720 --> 39:10.840
Hey, G, hey!

39:13.800 --> 39:16.960
So he went after them, in his bare ass.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.120
Hey, guys, police!
Run, come on, get out! Now!

39:23.400 --> 39:26.440
Oh man, you scared the shit out of me.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.080
Clear this away, man.

39:28.720 --> 39:29.760
Pizza!

39:52.920 --> 39:54.520
Good morning!

40:12.400 --> 40:16.040
Hey, that's my beer.
Make yourself at home.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.360
What do you want to do
with all that money?

40:27.320 --> 40:29.400
Replace that old junk with a new lab.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.800
You can't be serious? After all this?
You'll have 100,000 euros.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.280
-That's a lot of sangria.
-Yeah…

40:36.920 --> 40:39.080
Sangria's better than this shit.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.920
Hypocrite. How much
did you rake in in your lifetime?

40:44.520 --> 40:46.160
How much is left?

40:47.480 --> 40:49.120
We're not the same.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.680
-I'll stop as soon as I have enough.
-Is that so? How much is enough?

40:55.720 --> 40:57.160
We'll see.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.080
Jezebel…

41:01.040 --> 41:02.880
You have Bouman blood.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.000
The longer you wait, the harder it gets.

41:07.720 --> 41:12.160
And at a certain point, it'll be too late
and you'll have lost everything.

41:12.240 --> 41:16.280
Your money, your family, your friends.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.360
Jeremy.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.120
Since when do you care?

41:23.920 --> 41:25.200
Since Danielle.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.440
Did you ever hear from her?

41:37.960 --> 41:41.080
You and Jeremy have something special.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.560
-Slow down with the beer, okay?
-I'm not blind.

41:43.640 --> 41:47.600
You have to treasure that.
You have to protect it.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.800
Jeremy chose this himself.

41:50.880 --> 41:55.440
-I didn't teach him how to cook.
-Jeremy is like a dog.

41:56.040 --> 42:01.080
Yes. He follows you everywhere you go,
so get your money and get out of here.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.840
And see the world. Aruba is nice.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.120
I don't want to leave.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.880
Things are finally turning around.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.960
It only looks that way.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.480
At a certain point, it'll be tough again.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.240
All my life has been tough.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.520
I know.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.840
Better than you think.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.600
I know that you mean well.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.960
But I'll figure it out myself.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.240
Jez!

42:45.240 --> 42:47.440
We're having
a small Christmas party tonight.

42:47.520 --> 42:51.760
Why? We have to be done
the day after tomorrow.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.040
Yes, but we're on schedule.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.040
And we'll have to eat anyway,
so if you want…

43:03.040 --> 43:05.600
You've promised, so you have to come.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.920
Dennis will be there too.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.520
I'm coming for you, and no one else.

43:15.400 --> 43:19.320
Make sure he stays out of my way,
or I'll cut his balls off.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.360
Ferry?

43:22.880 --> 43:24.720
Don't forget your Santa suit.

43:38.440 --> 43:45.040
Let me believe

43:45.120 --> 43:46.840
In love with you

43:47.680 --> 43:48.800
Ferry!

43:53.320 --> 43:56.040
-Merry Christmas.
-Same to you.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.080
My God…

44:03.120 --> 44:04.600
Cheers.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.360
I got you something.

44:11.960 --> 44:15.200
-I don't have anything for you.
-That's okay.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.160
Open it.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.960
Now they're back together.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.320
Okay, let's go!

44:38.400 --> 44:41.640
-Ferry!
-Who was the one screeching?

44:41.720 --> 44:44.000
-Dino, he really can't sing.
-No.

44:44.080 --> 44:48.760
Hey, by the way, Mr. Bouman.
We have a tradition.

44:50.520 --> 44:54.360
-I haven't even had a drink yet, man.
-Oh, Ferry, you can do it.

44:54.440 --> 44:57.280
Ferry, Ferry!

44:59.200 --> 45:01.880
Guys, I'm already sorry I came.

45:02.440 --> 45:03.280
But hey…

45:04.320 --> 45:07.120
You all worked really hard.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.480
So you deserve a party.
Thanks for the opening act.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.840
No problem.

45:11.920 --> 45:16.080
But here's the main act. Turn it on.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.400
-Tino Martin, really?
-You look like him.

45:25.560 --> 45:29.720
You left me…
I saw you walking, you were alone

45:29.800 --> 45:33.040
Your pride was no longer your thing

45:34.320 --> 45:37.960
My jaw dropped, I saw right away

45:38.040 --> 45:41.680
That you were not doing well

45:42.280 --> 45:46.400
You were always the one
Who modeled and pranced

45:46.480 --> 45:49.400
And showed all you had

45:50.720 --> 45:54.400
I see that happiness looked
At you for too long

45:54.480 --> 45:59.880
What is left of the person I adored?

46:00.520 --> 46:04.320
You gave me the chop
I was a mess

46:04.400 --> 46:08.080
I was not doing well
And you didn't care

46:08.160 --> 46:12.480
Without batting an eyelid
So slick

46:12.560 --> 46:14.400
You said the words

46:14.480 --> 46:16.760
-That you deserved more
-That you deserved more

46:16.840 --> 46:20.880
You gave me the chop
Wanted more out of life

46:20.960 --> 46:24.960
But is that you I see there?

46:25.040 --> 46:28.880
Am I upset that you didn't choose me?

46:28.960 --> 46:33.200
I thought it would turn out differently

47:00.400 --> 47:02.600
-Food!
-Hey, Dennis!

47:04.480 --> 47:05.840
Grub!

47:06.680 --> 47:08.920
-Dennis!
-Hey, hello!

47:09.760 --> 47:13.360
-Were you the one squalling?
-Yeah, yeah.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
-Hey, cheers, guys.
-Cheers.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.720
Look each other in the eyes,
or it's seven years of bad sex.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.720
No, man.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.920
It's good, right?

47:28.640 --> 47:32.080
Shawarma? For Christmas, what a splurge.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.480
Cheers.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.320
Thank you.

47:39.920 --> 47:43.320
-Jer will be our folk singer.
-And that's why I love you.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.080
Catch.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.520
-Close.
-My turn.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.520
Shut up.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.200
Shut up!

47:55.800 --> 47:59.240
I just wanted to say
that I'm happy I'm here with you guys.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.360
Dino, Steve, Jer.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.400
I'm really fucking proud of us.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.320
I think we're a really good team.

48:11.080 --> 48:14.480
No one will tear us apart!

48:16.240 --> 48:17.800
Nice, boys.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.760
And Jer, I love you.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.160
And… Sorry.

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
Sucker.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.760
And thank you
for showing your ugly face again.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.960
-We're family. As you can see.
-Better late than never.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.560
And also for helping us.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.400
-Ferry!
-Yes!

48:53.560 --> 48:56.840
Of course I wanted to say something
to you too, Dennis.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.840
Because you've always been there for me.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.040
And the last couple of weeks were…

49:04.920 --> 49:07.840
Well, I don't know. But…

49:09.200 --> 49:11.760
I really wanted to thank you
for the chance.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.760
Because we're on our way
to the deal of our lives, guys!

49:15.840 --> 49:17.880
Drink up, pussies!

49:20.880 --> 49:23.240
Party, party, right?!

49:23.320 --> 49:25.040
-Let's go!
-Party!

49:25.640 --> 49:28.880
Come on, out of the way.
Out of the way, fatso!

49:47.400 --> 49:48.840
What's up?

49:48.920 --> 49:51.920
-Are you with Jezebel?
-Yes, why?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.760
The customer is getting impatient.
Are they ready?

49:54.840 --> 49:57.120
Yeah, I don't know.
I didn't count them yet.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.280
I want to meet up. Now.

49:59.360 --> 50:02.760
Give me the address.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

50:05.480 --> 50:08.760
-I've got to be somewhere.
-What, now?

50:12.040 --> 50:13.080
Okay.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.320
How are you doing with the pills?

50:16.400 --> 50:19.600
Nearly there. Another 100,000 to go.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.920
Nice.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.040
-Hey, it was super fun. Thank you.
-You too.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.720
-Take care.
-Take care.

50:31.480 --> 50:32.680
Where's he going?

50:35.160 --> 50:36.400
A date.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.320
Let's sing.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.160
Yo, Steve?

50:50.800 --> 50:53.200
-Give me your car keys.
-Where are you going?

50:53.280 --> 50:56.000
-We're low on drinks.
-You drank way too much.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.200
Give me the keys.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.520
Okay, I didn't know you would get mad.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.760
Take it nice and easy. That car…

52:54.480 --> 52:55.680
A rip-off?

52:57.720 --> 52:59.360
And someone has to die.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.840
-Ferry Bouman.
-Oh, fuck.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.240
Is that a problem?

53:07.400 --> 53:08.680
No.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.480
But why don't you do it yourself?

53:11.560 --> 53:14.800
I don't want people
to trace this back to me.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.000
How many are there?

53:18.640 --> 53:21.360
Three young guys, a girl and Ferry.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.760
What about the rest?

53:25.320 --> 53:26.880
Occupational hazard.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.400
I want 40,000.

53:31.480 --> 53:35.120
Half now and half when it's finished.

53:35.200 --> 53:39.040
I'll give you 50,000. When it's done.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.840
Clear?

53:43.960 --> 53:45.200
Okay.

54:06.280 --> 54:08.560
If someone shoots, she's dead too.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.000
Weapons down.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.120
Back up.

54:19.560 --> 54:22.960
There's money in the back. Take it.

54:25.160 --> 54:26.640
I don't need money.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.040
Do you know who I am?

54:36.200 --> 54:40.320
Listen, that deal was nothing personal.
Purely business.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.640
Business?

54:43.520 --> 54:46.720
I'll make you a few business propositions.

54:47.760 --> 54:51.680
Or I'll shoot you in the head right here,
right now.

54:53.440 --> 54:55.640
You probably don't want that.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.600
Or…

55:04.520 --> 55:07.360
I double Lex's 50,000.

55:09.720 --> 55:12.120
And in exchange you kill him.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.000
One hundred thousand?

55:17.520 --> 55:21.520
Your choice. Businesswoman.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.800
And I should believe you?

55:23.880 --> 55:27.200
Do you think he'll give
you that kind of money?

55:28.760 --> 55:30.760
Call him and ask.

55:33.600 --> 55:34.880
Okay.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.360
One hundred thousand. You live.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.240
He dies.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.080
Smart thinking.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.080
A friend of yours is in the freezer.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.080
He'll have a headache.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.480
Have a nice evening.

56:18.640 --> 56:19.640
Fuck.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.520
What are you doing here?

56:53.600 --> 56:56.000
Do you think you're still in charge here?

56:56.080 --> 56:58.560
I'm not here for you, I'm here for her.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.920
Just like the past years.
You're nothing to her.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.520
I am family.

57:03.600 --> 57:07.640
Some family. You killed her father.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.440
-What?
-Yes, I know it was you.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.240
You're imagining things.

57:16.320 --> 57:19.480
I would think twice
before saying stuff like that.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.920
Jurgen was killed
with the same weapon as Remco.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.400
I didn't do it.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.880
I know everything, man. I know the truth.

57:27.960 --> 57:31.920
The truth? Easy to say in hindsight.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.320
-You murdered Jurgen.
-I didn't do anything.

57:35.400 --> 57:40.000
Oh, you're blaming it on John?
Fucking coward.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.440
John would never do that on his own.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.480
Jurgen was talking to the cops.

57:44.560 --> 57:48.160
-She was ten years old.
-We did it to protect everyone. And you.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.840
Fuck off, Ferry.

57:49.920 --> 57:53.240
You did it to protect yourself.
Yes, we were irrelevant.

57:53.320 --> 57:57.720
-You killed Jurgen, no one else.
-Say that again and I'll kill you.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.320
Do you understand?

57:59.400 --> 58:03.520
Do it, goddammit.
Show Jez who you really are.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.360
John would never do something
like that on his own.

58:17.440 --> 58:21.280
-Jurgen was talking to the cops.
-She was just ten years old.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.760
-We did it to protect everyone. And you.
-Fuck off, Ferry.

59:03.760 --> 59:07.040
Jez… I have to tell you something.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.640
Yes?

59:20.720 --> 59:23.320
-Hey, Dennis.
-Is there a problem?

59:24.200 --> 59:27.240
No, I just want to know
if you have a time for me yet.

59:27.320 --> 59:29.880
No. No, not yet.

59:30.720 --> 59:33.160
I'm just checking that nothing changed.

59:33.240 --> 59:37.240
What would have changed?
You know what you're doing, don't you?

59:37.320 --> 59:39.640
What we're asking has to be done.
So just do it.

59:39.720 --> 59:41.400
I'll call you with the time.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.680
-Fucking bastard!
-Jez…

59:51.200 --> 59:52.080
Jez!

59:54.680 --> 59:56.320
-Hey.
-I'll go over there!

59:56.400 --> 59:59.200
-That's a really bad idea right now.
-I don't care!

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.480
-Hey! We'll figure it out.
-Fuck!

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.200
First, we'll make sure
that we have the pills.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.080
Easy. Calm down.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.960
It's not your fault, okay?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.960
Hey. Come here. Come.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.960
Goddammit.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.640
Fuck it.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.760
Fuck!

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.800
-Where's Jeremy?
-He's inside.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.040
Jezebel, no!

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880
Jer?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.160
Jezebel!

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.560
Jezebel?!

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.400
Over here.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.840
Help me here.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.960
Come on.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.080
-What happened, man?
-Your old junk caught fire!

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.000
Go! Out of here!

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.640
Fuck, fuck!

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.960
-Where were you, man?
-With Xia.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040
Who the fuck is Xia?

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.400
So you're drinking tea with some chick
while we were working?!

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.920
-You didn't finish any more?!
-How dare you fucking ask that?!

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.280
I'm just asking, you dick! Whatever!
I'm just asking!

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.800
Get out of here with those pills.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.400
You stay inside.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.600
Hello.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.240
I'm here to pick up my pills.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.200
That's not the way to do business.
The agreement was for tomorrow.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.160
But your lab burned down.
So just give them now.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.840
They're not here.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.320
Why make this so difficult?

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.280
The power couple. Hi.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.160
Nothing here.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.600
I said tomorrow.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.600
Today is fine.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.240
-Goddammit, man.
-Where are my pills?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.200
-That was a child.
-Dino!

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.280
Who's missing? Who?!

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.560
-Steve.
-Steve. Stevie.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.840
Stevie?

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.080
Steve!

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.720
I don't see him.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.520
Do you see him?

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.520
Hey, call him.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.640
Now, come on.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.680
Yeah, hand it over.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560
I really don't know where he is.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.480
He'll call us tomorrow morning.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.000
-You still think I'm not serious, do you?
-No, no!

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.200
I am serious.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.720
-Jeremy, go get Steve.
-Come on. Run, boy.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.040
Move!

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.120
You keep testing me, Bouman.
Really, with those tricks of yours.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.080
And maybe that worked in the past,
but times have changed.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.880
You're getting old. I can tell.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.680
If you can't handle this,
you'll have to go to a retirement home.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.120
Drooling, next to the geraniums.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.680
Ah, there he is.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.840
What the fuck? No, Dino!

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.200
It's not correct. I can see it right away.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.480
How many did you say there were?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.760
-Four hundred thousand.
-Four hundred thousand.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.480
-That's not enough, right?
-Get your pills and get out of here.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.480
-We said half a million.
-You have enough.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.000
No, no, no.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.600
You wanted to be the big man.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.080
You didn't want to risk your life
for 250,000,

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.480
so that means 100,000 to go.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.760
Lex.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.320
No stress.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.920
You have until tomorrow,
so put your heads together

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.120
-and find a solution.
-Knock it off, man.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.360
Ideas, anyone?

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.760
Ideas?

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.680
-No one?!
-We have PMK and a lab!

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.040
-Shut up.
-We can cook at the cops' place.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.000
-We'll never get there.
-Wait, Ferry!

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.600
One night, one batch. 100,000, in and out.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.600
Jeremy, shut up!

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.840
Great plan.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.760
You go with them.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.320
With Uncle Ferry and Jezzy.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.320
The three of you will go.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.600
Steve knows the way. Leave Jezebel here.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.600
One can't ask a girl
to dig a grave, right?

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.120
That's not done, Bouman.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.000
If you try something,
the softie gets it. Okay?

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.480
I'm done with this shit show.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.760
You're fixing it or I'll kill you.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.280
Okay? Bye.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.440
TRAINING CENTER
POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.440
Fuck!

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.840
-Goddammit.
-The other way around.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.200
Do it yourself.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.279
Fuck.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.560
Hurry up, man.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.920
Shit.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.200
Quick, upstairs. Hurry.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.479
POLICE

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.000
You know, it's not that bad.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.040
Something wrong?

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760
No.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.600
Hey!

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:49.760
What are you doing here?

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.680
I'm…

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.000
Nathan for Control.
I need backup in the basement.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.760
Control room for Nathan.
Can you please clarify?

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360
Answer.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.480
Nathan?

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.440
False alarm. Everything under control.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.880
Are you just going to stand there?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.080
Fucking coward!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.520
-You can't wait to…
-Jez!

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.560
-You can't wait…
-Shut up!

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.160
This is fucking insane, man.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.400
Shut up, man. A little late, dickhead.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.800
Merry Christmas.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.840
Yeah, fine. Hurry up.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.160
Can we talk for a minute?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.120
Hey. I didn't want this either, okay?
I'm sorry about Dino, really.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.840
-Fuck off!
-Hey!

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.120
I'm in deep shit too, or not?

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.880
-It's Ferry's fault your lab exploded.
-Fuck you.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.640
That thing's beeping. The MDMA is ready.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.240
They're not going to hurt Jeremy. Really.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.600
Don't go blaming me. You wanted this too.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.520
Shut up, both of you.
I want to get out of here.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.840
Do you really think
I enjoy working for Lex?

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.120
I had nothing left. Thanks to him.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.000
We'll figure this out together.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.440
Maybe it'd be better if you leave
the drop-off to Ferry and me.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.880
Fer and I do the drop-off
and you can go home.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.240
To Jeremy.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.080
Hey, tomorrow everything will be fine.
Okay?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.120
Hey.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.120
Fucking bastard!

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.800
-Dirty, sneaky son of a bitch!
-Damn it!

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.080
-Fucking bastard! I'll kill him!
-Calm down!

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.240
-I'll kill him! Son of a bitch!
-Jez.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.360
-I'll kill you!
-Calm down!

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.560
-Jez.
-What?!

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.920
He killed your father, man.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.280
-It wasn't a carjacking.
-Shut up.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.360
-He thought your dad talked to the cops.
-You're lying.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.520
Why the fuck would I lie about that?

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.400
-You killed Jurgen.
-I didn't do anything.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.760
Oh, you're blaming it on John?
Fucking coward.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.800
John would never do that on his own.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.760
-Jurgen was talking to the cops.
-She was ten years old.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.840
-We did this to protect everyone. And you.
-Fuck off, Ferry.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.400
You did it to protect yourself.
We were all irrelevant.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.520
You killed Jurgen, no one else.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.360
Say that again and I'll kill you.
Do you understand?

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.080
Do it, god…

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.840
Come on, we have to leave.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.040
Come. Come on.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.960
-Come on.
-Hands off!

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.720
You stay here. Or I'll kill you.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.840
I swear.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.640
This is Dennis' voicemail.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.600
-Yes?
-Are you with Lex?

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.000
-Yes, why?
-Do it now.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.560
Kill him!

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.920
Xia?

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.440
Something wrong?

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.840
No clue.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.760
UNKNOWN

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.360
-Shouldn't you answer it?
-No. Not the right moment.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.040
Everyone ready? They're coming.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:56.920
Very good.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.880
Goddammit.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.720
Dirty rat!

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.360
Get up.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.760
Come with me.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.800
Hey, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.000
Okay. Go, go, go.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.520
Jezzy, come here!

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.480
Jezzy?!

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.360
Jezzy?!

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.400
Jezzy?

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.920
Run, run!

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.400
Come here.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.920
You water rats. Come on.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.200
Come over here.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.200
Look, look.

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.160
Funny that I'd be the one to kill you.
Right?

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.760
Do you think you're a hero now?

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.600
Come.

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.160
Come.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.440
Thank you.
