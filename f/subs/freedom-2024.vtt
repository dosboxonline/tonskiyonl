00:17.208 --> 00:19.499
Although inspired by the life
of Bruno Sulak,

00:19.500 --> 00:20.707
this film is fiction.

00:20.708 --> 00:24.124
Characters, situations, places
and certain events

00:24.125 --> 00:26.999
might be modified or reinvented

00:27.000 --> 00:28.791
to express the author's artistic vision.

02:11.541 --> 02:14.250
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody move.
This is a robbery.

02:14.958 --> 02:17.874
No one will get hurt if you do as I say.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.415
Tie your hands.

02:19.416 --> 02:22.082
- I have two kids.
- You can tell that to the cops.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.499
The tape.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.582
Open the cash drawers slowly.

02:26.583 --> 02:27.957
Fill up the bag.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.332
Fill up the bag that has been provided.

02:30.333 --> 02:34.083
The checkout at the far end, get the bills
together and give them to number 2.

02:34.791 --> 02:38.208
Morning, ma'am. I'm gonna take a lollipop.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.791
Here. Tie your hands, sit down.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.083
And remember, this money is not yours.

02:48.208 --> 02:51.415
- Hurry up. Do as he says.
- Thank you, Nicole.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.332
Relax, it's not your money.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.333
- Checks as well?
- Yes, checks and bills, thank you.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.207
Good. There.

02:59.208 --> 03:02.166
It's easy, right? Thank you.
Have a lovely day.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.707
- Here.
- Thank you.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.416
Thank you, ma'am.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.875
Can you hold this? It's too sweet.

03:11.250 --> 03:15.165
Have a pleasant day.
Apologies for the inconvenience.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.250
And I'll see you soon.

04:11.791 --> 04:12.625
Hey!

04:14.333 --> 04:17.000
Careful. Watch the road, Annie.

04:32.916 --> 04:36.291
- So this isn't your bag?
- No.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.665
And what's in it is not yours either?

04:40.666 --> 04:42.000
No, it's not.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.083
What are you doing here, then?

04:45.333 --> 04:47.166
- I don't know.
- Well, you're innocent.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.957
Damn. That was very nearly
a miscarriage of justice.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.957
I was this close to sending him to prison.

04:53.958 --> 04:57.332
Excuse me. Sorry.
I'm sorry. You can go.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.290
I'm sorry.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.250
Wait, Tonio, tell me one thing.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.541
How many times have I arrested you?

05:03.916 --> 05:06.999
- Give me a number.
- I don't know.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.665
Six... Maybe seven times.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.583
Seventeen times.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.208
Sit down.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.582
Come on, the old lady recognized you.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.041
Boss, there's been a robbery
at the Orange Continent.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.249
- The Orange Continent?
- The old Unico.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.749
- Shit. Any casualties?
- None.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.290
Well, that's something.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.624
How much?

05:30.625 --> 05:32.915
Around 200k. This week's takings.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.249
We've identified one of the guys
from a photo.

05:35.250 --> 05:39.874
Sulak Bruno, born on November 6th, '55,
in Sidi Bel Abbès, Algeria.

05:39.875 --> 05:43.040
Legionnaire in the 2nd REP,
deserted 18 months ago.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.458
Does he have a record?

05:44.583 --> 05:48.124
He did four months for theft
when he was 18.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.124
Small stuff.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.582
Since he deserted,
he's upgraded his business,

05:53.583 --> 05:55.458
he's suspected in a dozen robberies.

05:55.708 --> 05:59.040
Always supermarkets.
Avignon, Albi, Beaune.

05:59.041 --> 06:02.208
Always the same crew. Two of them,
plus one who waits in the car.

06:03.416 --> 06:05.457
- Who identified him?
- Two employees.

06:05.458 --> 06:06.957
They were in the robbery.

06:06.958 --> 06:10.666
- They're here.
- Could they be accomplices?

06:11.583 --> 06:14.791
Honestly, everything's possible,
but I doubt it.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.665
- Bring them in. I'll talk to them.
- Okay.

06:18.666 --> 06:20.833
- No, leave the photo here.
- Okay.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.375
Tonio, my boy.

06:24.708 --> 06:28.000
This is your lucky day.
Get out of here, I'm tired of you.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.541
Just go before I change my mind.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.666
The black and white doesn't help.

06:37.791 --> 06:40.375
You can't see the color of his eyes.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.374
- It's a bit stiff.
- But mugshots, you know...

06:44.375 --> 06:46.000
No one looks great in profile.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.874
He's better looking in person.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.000
Eyes like that are really unforgettable.

06:53.916 --> 06:56.374
And his smile. A big smile.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.208
- Lovely.
- A handsome boy.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.832
And polite.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.040
Good-looking.

07:04.041 --> 07:05.833
Really good-looking.

07:08.416 --> 07:09.916
Wait, ladies,

07:10.791 --> 07:13.499
we're talking about a robber.
Not some pretty boy in a club.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.790
Your little angel has stolen 20 million.

07:15.791 --> 07:16.999
Yes, well, I...

07:17.000 --> 07:19.874
- And the other?
- The other?

07:19.875 --> 07:22.000
- What other?
- The other guy.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.707
I couldn't really see.

07:25.708 --> 07:29.124
- I didn't pay attention, sorry.
- Me neither.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.000
Thank you, ladies.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.916
Who is this clown?

07:59.666 --> 08:01.250
- One.
- What?

08:02.541 --> 08:03.832
Forget it.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.499
I don't believe you, you won't do it.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.332
- Two.
- Stop it.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.041
It's stupid,
we don't even know how deep it is.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.125
Bruno.

08:13.708 --> 08:16.749
- I'm serious. Very serious.
- You're very serious?

08:16.750 --> 08:19.332
If you do this, I won't talk to you
for the rest of the day.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.916
- The rest of the day? That's a long time.
- Very long.

08:25.916 --> 08:27.458
- Three.
- Bruno, stop.

08:29.416 --> 08:31.416
I'm serious. I'm scared.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.999
I love you too.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.500
No!

08:44.416 --> 08:45.958
Yeah, right.

08:47.416 --> 08:49.041
Very funny.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.541
Come up now.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.291
Bruno!

09:14.500 --> 09:15.958
Bruno!

09:21.875 --> 09:23.125
Bruno!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.916
You're a dick!

09:27.208 --> 09:28.833
Fuck!

09:32.166 --> 09:33.957
You're a dick.

09:33.958 --> 09:35.707
I... You scared me.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.624
You're as crazy as I am.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.291
You didn't know that?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.707
Do you know what I love the most?

10:10.708 --> 10:12.000
Besides me?

10:13.541 --> 10:15.166
Besides you.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.999
<i>The wind on the skin.</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:22.416
<i>The wind that caresses.</i>

10:32.375 --> 10:33.915
<i>And you?</i>

10:33.916 --> 10:35.916
<i>- Besides you?
- Yes.</i>

10:37.375 --> 10:38.750
The speed.

10:44.416 --> 10:46.957
<i>Do you know what I wanted to do
when I was young?</i>

10:46.958 --> 10:49.416
<i>- No.
- A lot of things.</i>

10:52.583 --> 10:55.291
- What's stopping you?
- Nothing.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.125
I'll do them all one day.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.082
<i>- Do you know what I like the most?
- No.</i>

11:01.083 --> 11:05.374
<i>When the sky and the sea meet
and you can't see the horizon.</i>

11:05.375 --> 11:07.625
We'll go live by the sea.

11:09.416 --> 11:10.625
<i>And we'll have a baby.</i>

11:11.125 --> 11:12.291
What?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.665
- Hi. I'm Bruno.
- Annie, nice to meet you.

11:51.666 --> 11:53.083
Nice to meet you.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.957
We can share a bottle.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.916
Sounds good. Who's that?

12:03.458 --> 12:05.750
- Wow.
- Marika's here.

12:07.916 --> 12:09.415
Look at my princess.

12:09.416 --> 12:12.249
- I thought you were coming tonight.
- Hi!

12:12.250 --> 12:14.832
- Nope.
- Oh, wow.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.625
- How are you?
- My princess.

12:19.666 --> 12:20.750
Come have a drink.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
This is beautiful.
I'm happy to see you.

12:23.583 --> 12:27.207
- What do you think of the view?
- It's not too bad.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.416
Over there is <i>Le Château de ma mère.</i>

12:29.708 --> 12:31.625
And over there, <i>La Gloire de mon père.</i>

12:31.791 --> 12:34.000
And he just jumped on him.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.124
On his shoulders.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.416
And he just bit his neck.

12:39.958 --> 12:43.207
Seriously. His tendons were...

12:43.208 --> 12:46.415
- That's not what happened.
- Yes, it is.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.499
You can't say that, Bruno.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.874
It's a matter of common sense.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.165
You have no common sense.
You can't say that politics is useless.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.749
Politics only helps the rich to stay rich,

12:56.750 --> 12:59.040
and the poor have to shut up.

12:59.041 --> 13:02.124
You're exhausting,
you don't believe in anything.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.374
I believe in freedom.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.082
And Chirac, Marchais
and Mitterrand won't give it to us.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.000
I disagree.

13:08.708 --> 13:11.707
- Who's taking the second share?
- You.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.457
But my share is your share.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.707
Everybody did the job,
everybody gets paid.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.833
I don't care, I don't want it.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.208
Give me the checks.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.833
Can you believe it?

13:27.208 --> 13:31.708
We've given a lot of groceries
to a lot of good people.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.790
But we should tell these good people,

13:34.791 --> 13:37.874
because instead of thanking you,
they want to see you in jail.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.624
- Robin Hood.
- We haven't done anything wrong.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.958
Except stealing from
bigger thieves than us.

13:43.333 --> 13:46.124
Don't worry,
the big cats never go to jail.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.832
- Communist!
- It's not about that,

13:48.833 --> 13:50.666
I just want to blow everything up.

13:51.416 --> 13:52.541
Terrorist, then.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.208
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

13:58.916 --> 14:00.416
What?

14:01.833 --> 14:03.249
Nothing.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.041
You're handsome.

14:22.333 --> 14:27.291
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody move.
This is a robbery.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.375
Do as I say and everything will be fine.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.375
Hurry up!

15:08.791 --> 15:10.207
SUPERMARKET COOP

15:10.208 --> 15:12.500
Nobody move, this is a robbery!

15:14.000 --> 15:17.457
Do as I say, and no one will get hurt.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.249
Open the cash drawers.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.000
Empty them in this bag. Hello, ma'am.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.333
The 500 bills together,
the 100 bills together.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.333
- Come on, baby.
- You have to put it behind.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.625
Look.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.166
- Amazing.
- You got me closer.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.750
- That's our ball.
- That's two points.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.000
Should we start again?

16:18.083 --> 16:20.666
<i>- Hola, cabrones!</i>
- Patrick.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.375
Behind the mountain.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.415
You're not ready to play now.

16:27.416 --> 16:30.165
- I'm exhausted.
- It's nice to see you.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.500
What do we have to drink?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.957
Some friends of mine had a vineyard,
amazing wines.

16:35.958 --> 16:39.540
They could mess with your head.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.833
But apparently,
it was back in the 12th, 13th century.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.665
- Wines that drive you mad?
- Or blind.

16:45.666 --> 16:48.707
That's totally bullshit.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.082
- It doesn't happen with all the grapes.
- You said that.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.332
- Okay, I'm going back up.
- What?

16:54.333 --> 16:56.165
- Yeah.
- Are you coming with me?

16:56.166 --> 16:58.165
- Are you coming?
- I'll be right there.

16:58.166 --> 17:01.665
- Be careful.
- Don't worry, I worked in a restaurant.

17:01.666 --> 17:04.040
Put the knife down.

17:04.041 --> 17:07.124
- You're trying to calm me down.
- Calm down.

17:07.125 --> 17:11.457
You're trying to calm me down, I know you.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.291
I know you.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.333
This feels nice.

17:16.916 --> 17:19.790
Patrick, listen to me if you want to come.

17:19.791 --> 17:22.290
Why not that one? It's closer.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.041
No. We've already hit
all the supermarkets in the area.

17:25.166 --> 17:27.874
No, we haven't done that one,
outside Rodez.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.040
Which one is it? Continent, Mammouth?

17:30.041 --> 17:33.624
My dear Continent lover, it's a Mammouth.

17:33.625 --> 17:37.707
Patrick, you go in after me,
you hold the cashiers at bay.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.749
- And where am I, Bruno?
- You, my love,

17:40.750 --> 17:44.082
you're in the parking lot,
ready, engine going.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.833
Okay. What kind of car do we have?

17:45.958 --> 17:49.040
- A Renault 30.
- No, I said I wanted a BMW.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.374
- It's fine.
- They're heavy, not reliable.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.207
We tried to get another one.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.290
I want a BMW, guys.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.749
It's about the driver, not the car.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.915
- Is everybody ready?
- Ready.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.499
- No worries.
- We'll go at six o'clock tomorrow morning.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.958
- Don't party too hard.
- You too, Pat.

18:07.958 --> 18:11.708
I'll check the plan one more time.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.750
Okay, let's go. Good night, everyone.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.625
Just in case...

18:38.250 --> 18:40.790
Give the bag to the next cashier.

18:40.791 --> 18:42.833
Come on, it'll be over soon.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.832
Fill it.

18:47.833 --> 18:51.165
Next register, thank you.
Please stay calm.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.249
- What are you doing?
- Fill up the bag.

18:53.250 --> 18:56.415
- You coon, you're not Al Capone.
- I'll show you.

18:56.416 --> 18:59.166
- What's up?
- Patrick, cable ties, go on.

18:59.875 --> 19:03.165
- What do I do?
- Cable ties!

19:03.166 --> 19:06.374
Everybody stay calm.
Nobody moves, hands on the counter.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.207
I don't want to die, I have a little girl.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.707
Shut up. On the counter.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.875
- Load it. Shut up.
- You'll pay for this.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.749
- Load it.
- Drago?

19:15.750 --> 19:16.750
Fill up the bag!

19:18.250 --> 19:19.832
Hands on the counter!

19:19.833 --> 19:21.165
Listen to me, fuck!

19:21.166 --> 19:22.124
I said shut up!

19:22.125 --> 19:23.875
- What's wrong? You got this?
- We're fine.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.875
- Tell me.
- We're fine.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.958
You're not going to die, calm down.
Nothing will happen. Relax!

19:33.041 --> 19:34.625
Get your hands off me. Relax.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.707
Shut up, stop moving!

19:37.708 --> 19:39.540
Stop moving!

19:39.541 --> 19:41.707
- Are you insane?
- Move.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.165
- Listen to me! Calm down.
- I don't want to die.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.500
- What is he doing?
- Move.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.207
Breathe, relax.

19:51.208 --> 19:54.791
- I can't breathe.
- Stop.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.915
I can't brea...

19:56.916 --> 19:59.207
Look at me.

19:59.208 --> 20:02.625
- Relax, Brigitte.
- Breathe.

20:03.416 --> 20:07.166
- I can't! Help, I can't do it!
- Look at me, stay with me.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.375
Let's bounce.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.624
- What's going on?
- Shush.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.333
What shush? Calm down, boy.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.790
What? What's going on?

20:47.791 --> 20:50.832
- Why did you do that?
- Did you kill someone?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.665
Next time, I'll kill you.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.332
- Is that a threat?
- Yes.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.915
We're here for the money,
not to kill people.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.915
- Are you threatening me?
- Yes.

20:59.916 --> 21:02.540
I didn't kill anyone,
this thing just went off!

21:02.541 --> 21:05.749
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

21:05.750 --> 21:07.915
We're fine, nothing happened, calm down.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.041
Don't do that ever again!

21:11.458 --> 21:13.916
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

21:27.041 --> 21:29.333
<i>- What's the story?
- He recognized Sulak from the photo.</i>

21:29.500 --> 21:31.624
Take everything. The other side, too.

21:31.625 --> 21:34.457
<i>Hello. Tell me what happened.</i>

21:34.458 --> 21:36.832
<i>She's the cashier who got attacked.</i>

21:36.833 --> 21:38.583
<i>I'll go talk to her.</i>

21:38.833 --> 21:41.040
<i>They came in, we got violently attacked.</i>

21:41.041 --> 21:44.540
<i>They pointed their guns at us,
they were shouting.</i>

21:44.541 --> 21:48.249
<i>- How many were they?
- Four or five.</i>

21:48.250 --> 21:50.832
<i>- Can you describe them?
- Yes.</i>

21:50.833 --> 21:52.707
One big Black guy.

21:52.708 --> 21:56.790
A beast with bloody eyes.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.415
And a small hysterical white guy.

21:59.416 --> 22:04.332
In my opinion... You know?
He was screaming, shouting, shooting.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.374
And a blond guy with blue eyes,
in a complete panic too.

22:07.375 --> 22:10.290
He was rude to everyone. Very rude.

22:10.291 --> 22:14.249
- And then?
- I screamed, and they all left.

22:14.250 --> 22:18.082
- And they took nothing?
- They took our takings.

22:18.083 --> 22:20.541
I can humbly say that I saved lives.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.750
That's great.

22:22.916 --> 22:26.499
So? What do you think?

22:26.500 --> 22:29.707
With dumbasses like him,
we will never catch Sulak.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.458
For sure.

22:34.583 --> 22:38.500
We're organizing having drinks tonight,
for your departure.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.916
A farewell party? I don't like that.

22:42.208 --> 22:44.165
Warm bubbly, cold appetizers.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.791
Drunk officers trying
to hook up with the receptionist.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.832
- Pathetic.
- It makes the guys happy.

22:49.833 --> 22:52.708
It's not every day you get promoted
to Chief of Organized Crime.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.375
We need to celebrate.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.416
If you say so.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.291
Ciao.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.832
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

23:31.833 --> 23:34.250
- Now?
- Pack your things.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.625
Get dressed, pack a bag,
meet me downstairs.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.625
Don't turn on the light.

23:46.458 --> 23:51.000
Drago, Marika, let's get out of here.
Take the BMW, we'll see you in Paris.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.125
Patrick! Wake up. We're leaving!

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
- What's happening?
- He thinks the cops are coming.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.250
- Drago, move!
- Coming.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.833
Shit.

24:40.833 --> 24:44.583
It's crazy how you can feel
they're coming. How do you do that?

24:45.291 --> 24:46.958
- Fuck!
- Did you see that?

24:48.916 --> 24:51.541
- Are we going to Paris?
- Let's go, <i>mi amor.</i>

24:59.500 --> 25:03.124
I told Drago. It's over, I'm out.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.999
I've had enough of the police raids.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.957
No more prison, no more lawyers,
no more packages. Enough.

25:08.958 --> 25:11.874
I've had enough.
He promised he would stop.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.374
- Drago never went to prison?
- No.

25:14.375 --> 25:17.165
But it always ends up with prison.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.583
Who ended up in jail?

25:23.041 --> 25:24.375
My ex.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.875
He died in there.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.583
A settling of scores.

25:32.916 --> 25:34.582
What are you thinking? Banks?

25:34.583 --> 25:37.165
Banks are all connected
to local police stations.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.290
Armed security, traceable bills.

25:39.291 --> 25:40.582
Foreign exchange counters?

25:40.583 --> 25:46.249
No. You know what's good?
Fancy jewelers.

25:46.250 --> 25:49.249
Jewelry is nice, it's small, fancy.

25:49.250 --> 25:52.457
I'm a thug's girl, that's it,
That's how it is, I can't change.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.125
And you?

25:55.791 --> 25:58.833
I'm not a thug's girl, I'm with an artist.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.582
A poet, an outsider, a rebel.

26:03.583 --> 26:06.832
Everything he does, he does well.
He tried rollerblading,

26:06.833 --> 26:10.624
he was a natural. Jumps, tricks...

26:10.625 --> 26:12.707
- Backflips.
- You're addicted.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.416
We are addicted, yeah.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.832
Drago drives me crazy too.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.541
But I won't put mine on rollerblades.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.082
What are we doing with a loser like him?
He's nothing but trouble.

26:28.083 --> 26:31.207
You know, if it wasn't for the fact
he's your friend...

26:31.208 --> 26:33.041
Yes, but he's my friend.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.207
- Okay, but be careful.
- I'll talk to him.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.166
- You know what?
- What?

26:37.958 --> 26:39.250
If they go to jail...

26:39.375 --> 26:41.374
- Let's end up together.
- Sure.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.541
Deal!

26:45.083 --> 26:48.832
I don't understand, why aren't we dancing?

26:48.833 --> 26:51.000
- We're going.
- Let's go.

26:52.791 --> 26:54.708
Let's go!

27:35.000 --> 27:36.749
Hey. Tell me, Bruno.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.040
Your bling, who will you flog it to?

27:39.041 --> 27:41.290
- My bling?
- Yeah.

27:41.291 --> 27:44.958
We'll flog it back to them,
or the insurance companies.

27:45.416 --> 27:46.957
That's a good plan.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.458
That's smart, it could work.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.625
What's this idiot doing now?

27:54.416 --> 27:57.707
He's messing with a guy
he shouldn't mess with.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.124
- Do you know him?
- Yeah,

27:59.125 --> 28:00.624
Steve. He's from Yugoslavia.

28:00.625 --> 28:03.415
Go talk to him, he's gonna crush him.

28:03.416 --> 28:06.000
- I want him to get crushed.
- Go.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.750
Steve...

28:36.625 --> 28:38.457
It's paradise here.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.749
French cops are babies.

28:40.750 --> 28:44.540
French prisons are better
than hotels in Yugoslavia.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.207
It's paradise, I'm telling you.

28:46.208 --> 28:49.040
- Are you working?
- Here and there.

28:49.041 --> 28:51.749
I was Belmondo's bodyguard.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.665
Belmondo? Seriously?

28:53.666 --> 28:55.415
I even shot a movie with him.

28:55.416 --> 28:57.457
Hear that? He knows Belmondo.

28:57.458 --> 29:01.500
Belmondo, damn. That's awesome.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.916
I'm sleeping where Belmondo...

29:05.958 --> 29:09.374
Not sure you'd be into it,
but if you want to work with me,

29:09.375 --> 29:11.708
I may have something in the works.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.708
We'll see.

29:37.208 --> 29:40.290
Hello, sir. Welcome.
What can I do for you?

29:40.291 --> 29:42.250
I'd like to see your earrings.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.333
Of course, follow me.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.957
Is it for a special occasion?

29:48.958 --> 29:52.290
- An anniversary?
- Wedding anniversary.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.582
- Very well. Do you have a budget in mind?
- No, I thought...

29:55.583 --> 29:59.999
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery.
Everything will be fine.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.957
I'll handle it. Your hands, please.

30:02.958 --> 30:06.208
On the floor, sir. On the floor.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.208
Your hands, please. Hands.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.416
Go. Fifty seconds.

30:13.875 --> 30:16.249
Stay calm. We're here for the jewelry.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.541
Nobody will get hurt.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.791
Stay calm, thank you.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.375
No noise. It'll soon be over.

30:30.791 --> 30:32.208
Thirty seconds.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.708
Let's go!

30:40.458 --> 30:43.457
Thank you for cooperating.
Have a lovely day.

30:43.458 --> 30:45.832
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

30:45.833 --> 30:48.083
- And have a nice weekend.
- Thanks.

30:54.916 --> 30:56.375
Great job!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.333
Let's go.

31:06.208 --> 31:09.791
- Shit, there are two cars behind us.
- Relax.

31:13.208 --> 31:15.540
- What are you doing?
- I'll handle it.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.207
Move!

31:17.208 --> 31:20.249
They think they own the place.
It's always the same.

31:20.250 --> 31:21.915
Calm down, I'll take care of it.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.583
- I'm calm, I just need to pick up my kids.
- Excuse me.

31:24.791 --> 31:28.125
Move. You're blocking traffic, sir.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.416
Stay calm.

31:31.875 --> 31:35.125
- You can go, ma'am, move.
- Thank you, officer.

31:46.833 --> 31:50.041
- I'm telling you, this bastard...
- Can I get a coffee?

31:50.916 --> 31:53.166
- He attacked me.
- Shut up!

31:54.083 --> 31:55.458
One at a time!

31:56.458 --> 31:57.750
Want me to sit down?

31:58.125 --> 31:59.958
Sit down!

32:00.250 --> 32:01.625
I'll press charges.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.750
What the hell?
We can hear you from over there.

32:08.750 --> 32:11.790
I'm the victim,
but these assholes won't listen.

32:11.791 --> 32:12.874
What did you say?

32:12.875 --> 32:15.457
Assholes... What's going on?

32:15.458 --> 32:19.708
He says his client didn't pay him.
They had a fight. Nothing new.

32:20.333 --> 32:22.416
We found this on him.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.916
Drugs, soliciting, assault, theft.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.333
That's quite the list.

32:31.875 --> 32:35.125
Get me out of here
and I'll give you a crew.

32:35.708 --> 32:38.500
A crew? Who? What crew?

32:38.833 --> 32:41.875
Yugoslavs. They're planning a robbery.
I know one of them.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.208
But... Keep going, I'm interested.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.041
Take these off me, then we'll talk.

32:47.208 --> 32:49.249
- And my complaint?
- We'll write it down.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.915
Take it. Come with me.

32:50.916 --> 32:52.666
- And I want my money.
- Don't push it.

32:54.583 --> 32:56.416
The Jaeger-LeCoultre I told you about.

32:57.458 --> 33:01.332
A platinum model
with automatic perpetual movement.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.415
Classic and modern.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.833
It's very popular.

33:06.041 --> 33:07.416
Do you like it?

33:10.666 --> 33:13.791
- Is that a yes or a no?
- Yes, I said.

33:15.416 --> 33:16.707
Could we...

33:16.708 --> 33:19.708
- Can I put it on you?
- Of course.

33:25.583 --> 33:28.125
- Isn't it a bit heavy?
- No, I don't think so.

33:28.250 --> 33:33.125
- How much is it?
- This model is 63,000 francs.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.333
I see. I better not lose it then.

33:37.916 --> 33:41.374
Or have it stolen, because these days...

33:41.375 --> 33:43.791
There are so many robberies, you know?

33:44.916 --> 33:46.875
Listen...

33:47.750 --> 33:49.124
I'll take it.

33:49.125 --> 33:52.165
- Very good. Will you keep it on?
- Yes, please.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.415
I'll let you talk to my colleague
about the payment.

33:54.416 --> 33:56.125
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.499
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.957
Congratulations, it's a fine piece.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.208
Thank you. Can I get a discount?

34:15.666 --> 34:18.083
I don't think that's possible.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.666
What if I pay cash?

34:24.833 --> 34:28.541
In that case, I can give you 3% off.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.208
Five.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.750
Three point five.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.875
Three point five...

34:57.583 --> 34:59.625
I'll take it.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.958
It's nice.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.666
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.458
You always get up early.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.125
Let me sleep.

35:53.208 --> 35:56.333
- Croissants?
- Yes.

36:05.416 --> 36:08.665
- My love?
- Yes, my love?

36:08.666 --> 36:10.915
Can you get me tampons?

36:10.916 --> 36:12.583
Of course, my love.

36:13.416 --> 36:15.166
Thank you.

38:02.208 --> 38:04.750
You don't know any of these guys, right?

38:06.500 --> 38:09.916
- That's right.
- Sure.

38:11.375 --> 38:16.166
- And you? Miss...
- Braumann, Sophie. No.

38:16.291 --> 38:17.791
No, what?

38:18.583 --> 38:20.125
No, I don't know them.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.707
Sophie Braumann.

38:24.708 --> 38:27.082
That's Alsatian, Braumann.

38:27.083 --> 38:29.999
- My parents are from Bordeaux.
- Bordeaux?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.875
That's a beautiful city.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.915
The Saint-Jean neighborhood,
the Saint-André cathedral,

38:34.916 --> 38:36.875
the Garonne, the canelé cakes.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.040
- The wine, sometimes.
- Why the hell am I here?

38:41.041 --> 38:42.916
What do you think?

38:43.375 --> 38:46.832
I don't know this girl,
we hooked up last night.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.500
If I had known...

38:48.708 --> 38:50.915
It's dangerous to follow strangers.

38:50.916 --> 38:53.083
Has your mother from Bordeaux
never told you that?

38:54.125 --> 38:56.458
No, sir. She never told me that.

38:58.125 --> 38:59.707
Okay.

38:59.708 --> 39:02.958
Stop taking me for a fool, both of you.

39:03.291 --> 39:04.874
Your little act is worn out.

39:04.875 --> 39:09.791
You, honey,
I'll arrest you as an accessory.

39:10.083 --> 39:12.291
Criminal conspiracy.

39:12.416 --> 39:16.375
Fake ID, because they are fake IDs, right?

39:17.208 --> 39:21.665
And possession of stolen goods,
or do you have a receipt for the necklace?

39:21.666 --> 39:23.790
Accessory to what? Are you insane?

39:23.791 --> 39:25.708
Leave her alone.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.666
Do you know the women's wing
at La Santé prison?

39:29.916 --> 39:33.082
It's no Club Med.
especially for a pretty chick like you.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.457
She's gonna make a lot of friends. A lot.

39:35.458 --> 39:39.041
I didn't do anything,
I don't know this guy, we fucked once.

39:39.791 --> 39:42.708
I hope he was good,
because you're gonna pay for it.

39:43.750 --> 39:47.124
You're looking at five years in jail,
at least.

39:47.125 --> 39:50.165
When you're out, you'll be broken.

39:50.166 --> 39:52.082
Screwed.

39:52.083 --> 39:55.207
You won't be able to work again,
I'll make sure of that.

39:55.208 --> 39:58.124
You'll have to work the streets
to pay for your fix.

39:58.125 --> 40:00.874
One morning,
you'll end up dead in a dumpster

40:00.875 --> 40:03.582
behind a bar with a syringe in your arm.

40:03.583 --> 40:05.208
I don't do drugs.

40:07.375 --> 40:10.082
- Not yet, but it will happen.
- I didn't do anything.

40:10.083 --> 40:13.291
- The court will decide.
- Enough!

40:14.125 --> 40:15.416
Stop.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.832
- Why do you care?
- Fine, you win.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.957
Leave her alone, I'll talk.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.583
There you go.

40:28.875 --> 40:30.416
What do I get in return?

40:31.333 --> 40:33.749
I'll give you all the robberies
if you leave her alone.

40:33.750 --> 40:34.958
And your buddies?

40:36.541 --> 40:37.916
What buddies?

40:41.125 --> 40:43.582
- Pérez?
<i>- Yes, boss?</i>

40:43.583 --> 40:47.291
- Come pick up the lady.
<i>- Okay, boss. I'm on my way.</i>

40:52.833 --> 40:55.666
- Okay, come on.
- It's okay.

40:56.333 --> 40:58.290
- Ouch.
- Come on.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.250
Let's go!

41:10.916 --> 41:13.790
- What you did is really shitty.
- I know.

41:13.791 --> 41:16.125
I'm listening.

41:22.666 --> 41:26.790
Finally, the Cora supermarket in Beaune,
was that you?

41:26.791 --> 41:28.125
Yes.

41:29.041 --> 41:30.833
Tell me more.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.083
You won't arrest her, right?

41:35.083 --> 41:36.249
I gave you my word.

41:36.250 --> 41:38.915
- Yeah.
- I did.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.874
I'll talk to the judge,
she'll get probation.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.583
What about her fake IDs?

41:53.583 --> 41:55.332
What do you want to know?

41:55.333 --> 41:57.916
I went in, I robbed the place and I left.

41:58.375 --> 41:59.875
End of story.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.125
- Alone?
- Yes.

42:03.583 --> 42:08.290
You say you robbed 19 supermarkets
in eight months. Impressive.

42:08.291 --> 42:10.457
Always alone?

42:10.458 --> 42:12.874
- Always alone.
- No, I don't buy that.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.625
I'll tell you what I think.

42:15.250 --> 42:18.290
You were with your buddy Drago,
and the girl was waiting in the car.

42:18.291 --> 42:19.708
I don't know any Dragan.

42:20.500 --> 42:23.166
Dragan? We busted your buddies.

42:25.291 --> 42:27.166
Stop playing stupid, Bruno.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.082
Come on, you have enough
to make the judge hard.

42:33.083 --> 42:36.458
No, I'm very greedy,
that's my biggest flaw.

42:37.541 --> 42:39.375
Well, it's mine too.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.374
By the way, I need a favor.

42:42.375 --> 42:43.791
What is it?

42:45.458 --> 42:46.958
Can I keep my watch?

42:47.750 --> 42:51.624
Your watch? What's so special
about your Kelton?

42:51.625 --> 42:55.124
It's my dad's.
He gave it to me, it's precious to me.

42:55.125 --> 42:57.958
The guards will take it from me
if I have it when I go in.

43:00.041 --> 43:01.875
If it's a sentimental piece...

43:04.291 --> 43:05.500
Thank you.

43:11.666 --> 43:14.291
Let me say goodbye, please.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.958
Be quick.

43:17.625 --> 43:19.125
My love.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.333
I love you.

43:29.791 --> 43:31.999
- Come with me.
- I'll wait for you.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.082
I love you.

43:33.083 --> 43:36.083
Let's go, lovebirds.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.833
Hi.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.375
Hi.

45:13.041 --> 45:14.541
What are you in for?

45:15.583 --> 45:18.666
- Miscarriage of justice. You?
- Same.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.375
I got 12 years for armed robbery.

45:36.708 --> 45:38.083
You?

45:40.833 --> 45:42.500
Awaiting trial.

45:46.375 --> 45:48.040
I don't like the decor in here.

45:48.041 --> 45:50.124
And the food looks disgusting.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.791
I don't plan on staying.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.916
Jean-Loup Lablache.

45:56.958 --> 45:58.665
Bruno Sulak.

45:58.666 --> 46:00.083
I know.

46:35.916 --> 46:38.000
I don't think guards make enough money.

46:40.625 --> 46:42.625
I could have something for you.

46:43.833 --> 46:46.957
I could be interested.
But not here. Move.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.458
You know where to find me.

47:22.625 --> 47:26.040
<i>My love, every day, with my words,</i>

47:26.041 --> 47:28.125
<i>I caress your skin with the tip of my pen.</i>

47:29.250 --> 47:31.083
<i>And your lips too.</i>

47:31.791 --> 47:33.707
<i>You know,</i>

47:33.708 --> 47:35.415
<i>they want to make a beast out of me,</i>

47:35.416 --> 47:39.040
<i>but no matter how much they try
with force or ruse,</i>

47:39.041 --> 47:40.708
<i>I won't give in.</i>

47:41.208 --> 47:44.249
<i>I want to live the life I want,
to stay the boy that is exhilarated,</i>

47:44.250 --> 47:47.165
<i>like in the Reggiani song
that you like so much.</i>

47:47.166 --> 47:50.833
<i>To stay the person who is amazed,
who dreams, who is waiting for you.</i>

47:52.166 --> 47:55.416
<i>Life, my love, is not eternal.</i>

47:59.666 --> 48:01.915
<i>I'm alive, alive when I write to you,</i>

48:01.916 --> 48:05.458
<i>when I smell sometimes
the wind brushing my skin.</i>

48:09.666 --> 48:12.374
- How do we do it?
- Seventy-one.

48:12.375 --> 48:13.708
Okay.

48:15.041 --> 48:18.833
Hands on the table, old hand.

48:22.791 --> 48:24.874
That's nice. I like it.

48:24.875 --> 48:26.582
That's good stuff.

48:26.583 --> 48:28.040
We can make a trident with this.

48:28.041 --> 48:30.707
Tie them together, it'll hold.
It's strong.

48:30.708 --> 48:33.415
- Will you get more?
- Of course I will.

48:33.416 --> 48:34.958
<i>You were right,</i>

48:35.083 --> 48:38.207
<i>I like being an outsider,
different, like an artist.</i>

48:38.208 --> 48:40.790
<i>In another life,
I could have been a painter or a writer.</i>

48:40.791 --> 48:42.957
<i>But here, in prison,</i>

48:42.958 --> 48:44.582
<i>there's no room for culture.</i>

48:44.583 --> 48:47.000
<i>We are misunderstood, abandoned.</i>

48:47.291 --> 48:51.291
<i>They won't get to me, I don't want
to fall into hatred and violence.</i>

48:51.875 --> 48:53.708
<i>I'm stronger than this</i>

48:54.541 --> 48:56.791
<i>and I'll be back more alive than ever.</i>

48:58.833 --> 49:01.916
I got 12 years in the slammer,
I've done nearly six now.

49:02.708 --> 49:05.750
When I get out, I think...

49:06.666 --> 49:08.166
<i>I'll do simple things.</i>

49:09.000 --> 49:12.250
<i>Chowing down by the sea.
Maybe in the mountains?</i>

49:12.500 --> 49:15.666
I'm not saying
that I'll shack up with a goat.

50:07.250 --> 50:08.416
All clear.

50:54.125 --> 50:57.541
Wait. It's holding. No, wait.

51:05.875 --> 51:09.833
Come on.

51:11.375 --> 51:12.750
Come on.

51:16.208 --> 51:18.416
Let me... Shit.

51:37.666 --> 51:39.999
Yes! That's it.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.665
Let's go!

51:41.666 --> 51:43.833
- Come on.
- Slowly.

52:17.916 --> 52:19.332
Jump!

52:19.333 --> 52:21.165
Come on, Jean-Loup!

52:21.166 --> 52:22.375
Come on!

52:24.541 --> 52:26.583
Come on, you're almost there.

52:26.708 --> 52:29.249
Come on, you're almost there.

52:29.250 --> 52:32.540
Give me your hand.
Come on, Jean-Loup.

52:32.541 --> 52:35.999
You're almost there, Jean-Loup,
take my hand. Come on.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Good, hurry up.

52:41.791 --> 52:45.374
- Come on, Jean-Loup!
- I won't make it.

52:45.375 --> 52:47.375
- Come on!
- I won't make it, Bruno.

52:48.083 --> 52:49.957
Jean-Loup! Jean-Loup!

52:49.958 --> 52:51.541
Come on, damn it!

52:52.583 --> 52:54.208
Get out of here, Bruno.

52:54.916 --> 52:56.207
Get out of here, brother.

52:56.208 --> 52:58.625
- Jean-Loup.
- Get out of here. I won't make it.

52:59.708 --> 53:02.208
I'll come back for you.

53:11.583 --> 53:14.000
Let's go!

53:25.250 --> 53:26.666
Hello?

53:30.250 --> 53:31.916
What do you mean, "he escaped?"

53:34.208 --> 53:35.541
Okay.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.375
No, no, no.

55:11.916 --> 55:13.374
BRUNO SULAK DRAPED IN JEWELS

55:13.375 --> 55:15.625
POLICE ON SULAK'S HEELS

56:22.416 --> 56:24.665
SULAK, THE STAR

56:24.666 --> 56:28.500
- He's making fools out of us.
- Why are you obsessed with him?

56:29.083 --> 56:31.290
He's not
one of those trigger-happy idiots.

56:31.291 --> 56:34.082
Cartier in Geneva, hit twice in two weeks.

56:34.083 --> 56:38.374
Why does he do it? For the thrill!
He doesn't give a shit about the money.

56:38.375 --> 56:40.916
How much did he make with the robberies?
One hundred, 150?

56:41.791 --> 56:45.207
He doesn't give a shit,
he just enjoys doing it.

56:45.208 --> 56:48.665
We need to figure out why he does it,
then we'll be able to nail him.

56:48.666 --> 56:50.374
- Move your asses.
- Okay.

56:50.375 --> 56:51.832
- Let's go!
- Let's go, guys.

56:51.833 --> 56:53.958
Let's move.

56:56.166 --> 56:59.457
- Shake down your snitches, but find him.
- Okay.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.332
Anyone got a cigarette?

57:01.333 --> 57:03.458
Do you mind?

57:04.833 --> 57:06.583
A lighter?

57:30.291 --> 57:32.332
Flat whites are not good for digestion.

57:32.333 --> 57:33.749
What do you want?

57:33.750 --> 57:35.625
Nothing. We thought we'd have
breakfast with you.

57:36.333 --> 57:38.375
That's nice.
Were you in the neighborhood?

57:40.458 --> 57:42.666
You know,
every cop in the country is after you.

57:43.708 --> 57:46.624
We'll bust you,
in a week, a month, a year.

57:46.625 --> 57:48.124
We'll see about that, pal.

57:48.125 --> 57:49.457
Why did you come here?

57:49.458 --> 57:53.125
To tell you to back off.
Don't you have other guys to catch?

57:55.916 --> 57:57.083
You're my favorite.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.000
You're mine too.

58:04.458 --> 58:05.958
Mine too.

58:06.333 --> 58:07.624
Thank you.

58:07.625 --> 58:10.125
- Have a nice day.
- Anytime.

58:21.416 --> 58:24.375
- This is a bit mad, right?
- A bit.

58:25.750 --> 58:28.375
Let's go. Come on.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.415
- Hello.
- Hello.

59:02.416 --> 59:03.915
- Delostane.
- Go ahead.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.041
Thank you.

59:09.458 --> 59:11.874
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

59:11.875 --> 59:15.791
Come in, step to the side.
Raise your arms.

59:20.041 --> 59:22.832
Don't move.

59:22.833 --> 59:24.333
On the ground.

59:26.625 --> 59:29.666
- Open the door. Now.
- Open it.

59:30.166 --> 59:32.415
- Open it!
- Don't move.

59:32.416 --> 59:36.208
Go over to your friend,
lie down on the floor next to him.

59:36.916 --> 59:40.583
There. On the floor.

59:41.291 --> 59:42.666
Hello, gentlemen.

59:43.083 --> 59:46.750
First, let my friend in.

59:47.416 --> 59:49.874
- Done.
- Done?

59:49.875 --> 59:51.083
Good job.

59:54.916 --> 59:56.999
Cuff yourselves to the heater.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.249
I want the key to the cell.

59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.332
Jean-Loup Lablache's.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:04.291
- Now.
- Thank you.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.749
Michel, how was your daughter's recital?

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.415
Very good, thank you.

01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:13.791
- Number 12.
- Number 12.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.125
Sit down.

01:00:19.416 --> 01:00:21.583
Cuff yourselves.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:23.541
Gate!

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.875
Gate. Open the gate.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.707
Good.

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:30.875
Gate.

01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:47.791
- What do you smoke?
- Gauloises.

01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:50.290
- Not very strong.
- Unfiltered.

01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:51.500
I thought it was stronger.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.791
You're crazy.

01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:10.375
- You're amazing.
- I told you I'd be back.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.165
My friends are back.

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:19.707
- Bye, guys.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:21.707
- It was a pleasure.
- Thank you.

01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:23.250
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.832
- See you.
- See you.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.750
Bastards.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:29.208
Fuck!

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:32.958
Those guys have some balls.

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:37.708
Goodbye.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.916
You guys are insane.

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:56.707
ID, cash, you've got everything.

01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:59.332
And a ticket to Rio, through Lisbon.

01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:01.166
Your name is Carlos.

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.124
Stop it, guys, I'm gonna cry!

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.750
- We'll be there soon.
- Thank you.

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.583
- Room 14, second floor.
- Thank you.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.791
The door!

01:02:58.166 --> 01:02:59.791
I love you.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.958
- What are you watching?
- A sad movie.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:15.541
Hello? Can I speak to Franchet?
It's a private matter.

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:20.708
- Is it good?
- It's sad. I like it.

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:26.874
Franchet, it's me.
I've got the rocks. Yes.

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:28.583
Twenty-five million.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.625
In new francs, it's at least 100k.

01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:33.875
Yes.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:37.458
Tomorrow, midday. Pompidou Centre.

01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:39.833
Okay, let's do that.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:44.333
Come into my arms, my love.
It's too sad.

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:51.041
We got a lead. You'll like this.

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:54.540
Only one man. Where is the location
for the exchange?

01:03:54.541 --> 01:03:56.958
- Franchet, the insurer.
- Yeah, at Beaubourg.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.999
- Beaubourg.
- Pompidou Centre?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.415
- When?
- Twelve o'clock.

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:02.166
- Twelve.
- Yeah.

01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:13.958
- Circular motion, I said.
- Yes.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.458
Quiet, please.

01:06:04.791 --> 01:06:06.540
The court is now in session.

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:08.625
Will the defendant rise, please.

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:14.999
Your name is Sulak Bruno, born
November 6th, 1955, in Sidi Bel Abbès.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.915
Yugoslavian nationality.

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:19.583
I'm not Yugoslavian,
I'm French, Your Honor.

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:23.000
My father is French from Poland,
like Michel Poniatowski,

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.708
and my mother is a <i>pied-noir,</i>
like Marthe Villalonga.

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.415
Quiet, please. Good.

01:06:29.416 --> 01:06:33.582
You are being charged for
fraudulently taking away cash

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:37.624
to the detriment of supermarkets,
Mammouth, Atac and Rallye,

01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.374
between July 6th and 20th, 1983.

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:43.040
These acts were committed
as a part of a group,

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.707
and with use of a weapon
or threat thereof.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:48.540
As well as criminal conspiracy.

01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:52.915
Before we hear the testimony
of the lead investigator,

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:55.415
do you have anything to say?

01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:56.957
I do, Your Honor.

01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:58.957
You may speak.

01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:02.624
You know,
I was an excellent soldier. Excellent.

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:04.707
And I became an excellent outcast,

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:08.290
just as I could I have become
an excellent cop or magistrate.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:09.624
I surely doubt it.

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:14.124
What I would like for you to understand,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:18.415
and to you too,
Mr. Self-Righteous Prosecutor,

01:07:18.416 --> 01:07:21.165
is that I don't recognize your court
or your justice.

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:24.291
You mean nothing to me,
I deny you the right to judge me.

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:25.666
The court takes note of this.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:29.790
And neither Annie, Patrick nor Drago
were ever my accomplices.

01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:32.333
That is not what the investigation
brought proof of.

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:36.208
Just like in astrology,
the police can say whatever they want.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.708
Enough.

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:41.874
Sulak, we won't tolerate your impudence.

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:44.332
Impudence is all I have left.

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:46.166
Fine, sit down.

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:53.750
Defendant Drago, please rise.

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:56.833
He's not a proper Yugoslavian either.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.458
Will the defendants please rise?

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:10.582
After due consideration,
the court and the jury

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:13.708
sentence each of you
to three years in prison.

01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:18.332
As for yourself, madam,
since there were no previous convictions,

01:08:18.333 --> 01:08:21.624
you are sentenced to 18 months in prison,

01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:25.957
which will be suspended
and served on probation.

01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:28.749
You will be subjected to strict controls

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.040
for a period of two years.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:34.249
I'd like to say one more thing.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:38.707
Mr. Sulak, before you continue
your tour of France's court system

01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:41.124
for your many other offenses,

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:44.165
please know that
if you don't change your attitude,

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:47.540
the sentences will be extremely serious.

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.541
Court is adjourned.

01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:24.208
Pick a card.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.666
Do you really think
that you'd have been a good cop?

01:09:28.458 --> 01:09:30.041
Of course I do.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:33.374
Finally, the card

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.291
I was waiting two rounds for.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:38.457
Why did you desert the legion?

01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:40.082
Long story.

01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:42.624
To validate my freefall world record,

01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:44.582
I had to sign up for another five years.

01:09:44.583 --> 01:09:46.415
Five years.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:49.040
Why didn't you do it?
You seemed happy.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:50.790
You don't understand.

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:54.500
No one tells me what to do.
No one. Ever.

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:57.958
Pick a card.

01:09:58.416 --> 01:10:00.707
No one tells me what to do either.

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.458
No one. Ever.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.665
That's stupid, we could have been pals.

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:10.124
I could have shown you the ropes.

01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:12.416
- The ropes?
- Of life.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.957
- Life?
- Yes, your life is too restricted,

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.207
you're caught
between your bosses and felons.

01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:20.165
I am free.

01:10:20.166 --> 01:10:21.666
Really, you're free?

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:24.250
You're really free.

01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.499
Do you think
you're the only adventurer here?

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.333
We live the adventure too,
on the other side.

01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:35.416
You, you're either on the run
or in the clink.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.500
What kind of freedom is that?

01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.833
But you see, I chose this life.

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:44.582
Even in jail, I'm freer than you.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:48.165
Sure. Here we go, three sixes.

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:49.957
- Shit.
- Discard.

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:51.916
You're a lucky bastard, seriously.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.415
Why did you go back for Jean-Loup?

01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:12.499
I promised him. And I'm a nice guy.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.540
You are a nice guy.

01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:16.832
- Of course.
- We both know that.

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:19.582
The nicer you are,
the more people like you.

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:21.707
The more they like you,
the more famous you get.

01:11:21.708 --> 01:11:23.666
And the more popular you get.

01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:26.583
The more you annoy people.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:29.958
Pick a card.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.833
Excuse me.

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:44.457
The gun.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:46.000
In my bag.

01:11:48.458 --> 01:11:49.541
Follow me.

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:54.040
Get in and shut up.

01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:56.083
Close the door. I'm watching you.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:03.375
So you want to play, right?
Take that! Rummy.

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:06.707
Didn't see that coming, right?

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:09.332
Moréas, are you sleepy?

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.666
You're a humble guy.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.666
You want to play.
I don't want to play, I want to win.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.750
Hello. Don't move, guys.

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:24.040
- Let's go.
- No, thanks.

01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:25.374
I'd love that.

01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:28.333
Guns in the bag, and the handcuff key.

01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:29.666
Now.

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.791
- Let me keep mine, it means a lot.
- In that case...

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.749
Are you sure?

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:41.583
I'm too old to be on the run.
Good luck.

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:47.041
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:49.458
Have a nice day.

01:12:53.166 --> 01:12:54.875
Can you drop me off?

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.082
<i>Spectacular escape</i>

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:28.207
<i>in the Corail train from Montpellier
to Lyon this afternoon.</i>

01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:31.666
<i>A commando group made up
of several armed individuals</i>

01:13:31.791 --> 01:13:35.874
<i>managed to free the now
infamous Bruno Sulak,</i>

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:38.082
<i>as well as one of his accomplices,</i>

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:41.790
<i>while they were being transferred
to the Lyon penitentiary.</i>

01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:43.665
<i>The fugitives are still at large,</i>

01:13:43.666 --> 01:13:47.333
<i>despite the large contingent
of police officers on their trail.</i>

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.499
Thank you for today.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.749
<i>Moving on, the economy.</i>

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:56.915
<i>EEC finance ministers are meeting
in Brussels</i>

01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:58.457
<i>to raise by one point</i>

01:13:58.458 --> 01:14:01.499
<i>the interest rate of central banks,</i>

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.332
<i>which means that it will be
more difficult for households</i>

01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:07.833
<i>to get loans.</i>

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.208
And they call us thieves.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.500
We need to go. Far away.

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:29.458
Let's go someplace warm, please.

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:33.750
In the sun.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:35.791
To Los Angeles!

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.583
Chaplin's country.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:43.207
- Jim Morrison's country.
- Los Angeles.

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:44.625
Land of jewels.

01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.541
Novica Zivkovic.

01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.791
That's my real name.

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:28.458
- Hello?
<i>- Yes, pal. It's me, it's Bruno.</i>

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:32.915
- Yes?
<i>- I'm sorry about the other day,</i>

01:15:32.916 --> 01:15:35.250
<i>we didn't have time for the rematch.</i>

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:38.915
But we'll meet again very soon.

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:41.040
Sooner than you think.

01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:42.415
I'm not so sure.

01:15:42.416 --> 01:15:44.541
Where are you? Are you in Paris?

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.833
We could have a drink one of these days.

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.040
Of course, you'll come alone.

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:54.749
- Of course.
<i>- Sure, why not? I'll think about it.</i>

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:57.416
I have to go.
I can't say "See you soon," pal.

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:04.291
He's here, he's in Paris,
you need to find him!

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:26.165
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:27.708
- I'm here to report.
- Sure.

01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:40.000
POLICE STATION

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:43.374
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:45.625
- I'm here to report.
- Thank you.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.958
Annie Bragnier.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:15.082
- It's been two days. Move!
- Leave me alone.

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:17.000
- No.
- Come on.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.040
<i>It'll put a smile on your face</i>

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:22.291
<i>Come on, Annie</i>

01:17:22.416 --> 01:17:24.708
I'll make you a wonderful meal.

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:27.750
<i>Oh, yes, my little Annie</i>

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:40.875
- Hello.
- Annie Bragnier, reporting.

01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:07.582
- What's up?
- It's been so long!

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:08.957
Are you ready?

01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:12.500
- Ready? We're going on vacation.
- Really?

01:18:31.125 --> 01:18:32.916
My love, what are you drinking?

01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:37.415
- How about some ice cream?
- Sure.

01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:39.874
- Pistachio.
- Pistachio.

01:18:39.875 --> 01:18:41.624
I'll get you one.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:44.166
- Want some ice cream?
- No, I'm good.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.208
Steve?

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.416
Are we on vacation?

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.666
What are you doing?

01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:43.375
I'm leaving, I've had enough. Move.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:46.458
Why?

01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:49.791
Why?

01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.541
I thought we were on vacation.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:59.207
We can be on vacation and work.

01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.583
I don't think it's funny.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.125
It's gonna end badly, you know?

01:20:07.916 --> 01:20:09.415
What are you afraid of?

01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:12.124
Nothing. I just don't want it
to end badly.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.290
Actually, I am afraid for you and Steve.

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:16.624
See, you're afraid.
Do you want me to quit?

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:17.957
I never asked you to quit.

01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:19.875
But I'll never ask you to keep doing it.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.249
So what do you want, then?

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.750
I just want a few days of peace with you.

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:28.790
You were gone to America for months.

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:31.874
Just the two of us, for two days,
just two minutes, okay?

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:34.333
- Stop.
- When are you gonna stop?

01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:38.790
Don't you see? I won't be there.

01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:41.333
I won't be there when you get arrested.

01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:46.125
Honestly, the Cartier in Cannes,
you must both be insane.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:49.291
We won't get arrested. Annie, come on.

01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:55.083
Okay?

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.541
We won't get arrested.

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:10.708
Annie!

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:36.124
<i>Forty million francs worth of jewels.</i>

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:39.499
<i>That's the loot of the robbers
who attacked Cartier in Cannes yesterday.</i>

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.749
<i>The two robbers were identified
by the police.</i>

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:45.666
<i>The man is a Yugoslavian,
Bruno Sulak, "The Legionnaire",</i>

01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:47.457
<i>he already took part in</i>

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:50.916
<i>- in most of the robberies.</i>
- Annie! Bruno is on TV!

01:22:55.916 --> 01:23:00.540
<i>Around 12.30 p.m.,
two people came in together.</i>

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.624
<i>About one minute apart.</i>

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:04.249
<i>And they asked to see some pieces.</i>

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.707
<i>Thanks to one of the employees' testimony,</i>

01:23:06.708 --> 01:23:08.957
<i>the robbers were easily identified.</i>

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:12.207
<i>They're two Yugoslavians,
Bruno Sulak and Radisa Jovanovic.</i>

01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:15.958
<i>Bruno Sulak, "The Legionnaire",
is well-known to the police.</i>

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.582
<i>Bruno Sulak.</i>

01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:20.165
<i>Bruno Sulak, the offender...</i>

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:21.832
<i>The uncatchable thief...</i>

01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:23.499
<i>The man who escaped twice...</i>

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.790
<i>The modern-day Arsène Lupin...</i>

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:29.166
<i>...28 years old, hates violence.</i>

01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:33.582
<i>The loot is said to be worth
dozens of billions...</i>

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:38.124
<i>Sulak's heists have made him
the biggest public enemy number one.</i>

01:23:38.125 --> 01:23:40.249
<i>A very gentle man.</i>

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:43.625
<i>He's never, ever fired a gun.</i>

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:46.791
<i>That's a rule he always follows.</i>

01:23:49.166 --> 01:23:51.875
Yes? Boss! Sulak!

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:55.415
<i>So, how about that drink?
Are you free today?</i>

01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:57.375
<i>Noon at your café?</i>

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.999
<i>But you come alone, right?
You promised.</i>

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.333
<i>Of course, I promise.</i>

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:05.124
<i>If you ever find me in the street,
don't worry, I never carry a gun.</i>

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:07.540
<i>- You won't shoot me?
- I never carry a gun.</i>

01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:09.874
<i>If we find you, you won't shoot at us?</i>

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.291
<i>No.</i>

01:24:13.833 --> 01:24:17.291
Then let me tell you something,
if I can't find you, I'll quit.

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:21.124
If you hear that I've quit,
it will be your fault.

01:24:21.125 --> 01:24:23.666
<i>- In the news?</i>
- Exactly.

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:26.916
- Okay? See you soon.
<i>- See you soon, pal.</i>

01:25:13.916 --> 01:25:16.208
Police! Hands in the air! Don't move.

01:25:18.166 --> 01:25:19.833
Take off your helmet.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:23.374
- Who the hell are you?
- Nobody.

01:25:23.375 --> 01:25:25.999
I was asked to deliver this bag
to some guy outside the café.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.416
That's all. I'm a delivery guy.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:32.541
- Who asked you to deliver that?
- The baker.

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.124
Book this little clown.

01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.041
- Come on.
- I didn't do anything.

01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:41.916
Call off the crew. Back to the station.

01:26:01.875 --> 01:26:03.457
Hands on the wheel.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:06.208
Don't do anything stupid,
drive around the square. Come on.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.166
How are you doing?

01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:19.708
I'm good. How are you?

01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:24.707
- Did you enjoy Cannes?
- Yes, it was ballsy.

01:26:24.708 --> 01:26:26.250
You're impressed, aren't you?

01:26:27.666 --> 01:26:30.999
You gave me your word,
but you were far from being alone.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.624
You know how the big bosses are.
I can't do what I want.

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.583
I told you on the train,
you've got no power.

01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:39.208
Look in front of you.

01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:44.083
I won.

01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:46.957
You lost. I'm out of here.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:48.500
I quit.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.583
Look, I have more money than Borg.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:55.416
And I never played tennis.

01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:02.666
You'll get bored on vacation.
I'll see you again.

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:15.916
Okay, stop the car, I'm feeling nauseous.

01:27:23.416 --> 01:27:24.375
Here.

01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:26.290
Give this to Annie

01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:29.040
and tell her to call this number
from a payphone.

01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:30.750
Everything's inside. Tickets, cash.

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:33.708
No problem.

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:36.916
- Do you have what I wanted?
- Yes.

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:41.125
Here.

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.083
Is it the Pole?

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:47.124
He's in jail.
It's another guy, from Marseille.

01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.208
DRIVING LICENSE

01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:51.999
It's terrible work.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.624
And it's not cheap.

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:55.082
But you're famous.

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:57.499
People are scared.
They're asking for a lot of money.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.333
Yes, I know.

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:07.458
I'll call you when I'm in Rio.
Will you join us there?

01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:12.500
In Rio? I would absolutely love it.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:19.625
- Cheers, my friend.
- Cheers.

01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:29.332
<i>- Hello?
- My love.</i>

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:32.040
<i>My love, how are you? Where are you?</i>

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.083
<i>Too far, I'm too far away from you.</i>

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.707
<i>I'm about to cross the Italian border.</i>

01:28:37.708 --> 01:28:39.874
<i>We're going somewhere warm, to Brazil.</i>

01:28:39.875 --> 01:28:41.082
<i>Brazil?</i>

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:44.624
<i>Yes, you and me.
We're going to spend all this money.</i>

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:47.624
<i>We're gonna go to the beach,
we'll make love, and laugh.</i>

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.874
<i>We'll eat good food, bask in the sun,
have a lot of babies.</i>

01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:52.957
<i>We need to stop hiding.</i>

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:54.707
<i>We'll stay stuck together forever.</i>

01:28:54.708 --> 01:28:56.082
ID check.

01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:57.915
<i>- I like that idea.
- Really?</i>

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.332
<i>Yes.</i>

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.790
<i>- Will you join me?
- Yes.</i>

01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:02.250
<i>- Are we leaving?
- Yes.</i>

01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:05.083
<i>- See you tomorrow, my love.
- See you tomorrow.</i>

01:29:07.083 --> 01:29:08.624
- Hello.
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>

01:29:08.625 --> 01:29:11.791
Customs check.
Turn off the engine, please.

01:29:13.166 --> 01:29:14.875
Do you have your ID?

01:29:22.833 --> 01:29:24.125
Thank you.

01:29:33.083 --> 01:29:36.000
Please step out of the vehicle
and follow me.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.458
FRENCH CUSTOMS

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:51.458
I don't understand,
why a Belgian passport?

01:29:51.791 --> 01:29:54.749
Why? The passport is Belgian
because my father is Belgian

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:56.624
and my mother is Italian.
It's simple.

01:29:56.625 --> 01:30:00.041
- The dad's Belgian, the mom's...
- I get that.

01:30:00.541 --> 01:30:02.916
But I don't like your passport.

01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:05.249
So I'm waiting to hear back
from the embassy.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.374
They will tell you the same thing,
Are you drunk?

01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:08.582
I've wasted too much time.

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:11.082
I have to go to Italy,
I'm expected in Sicily.

01:30:11.083 --> 01:30:13.332
I don't understand anything!

01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:15.540
Please lower your voice.

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:17.208
Okay?

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:22.207
There's a woman somewhere else
waiting for me.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:25.124
- What is he saying?
- It's about a woman.

01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:27.708
And I didn't tell my wife.

01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:29.249
Love.

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:32.874
Yes, it's adultery.
He's going to see a woman in Italy.

01:30:32.875 --> 01:30:34.665
This gentleman is married, is that it?

01:30:34.666 --> 01:30:37.790
But that doesn't explain the passport.

01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:38.916
I don't like it.

01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:41.582
But there's nothing to understand.
I've wasted too much time.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:42.875
chatting here in this room.

01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:46.832
Please. I can't wait any longer,
I have to go to Italy.

01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:49.375
This woman is waiting for me. I can't...

01:30:52.416 --> 01:30:53.583
Oh, Bruno.

01:30:54.958 --> 01:30:57.374
Looking good.
Being blond suits you.

01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:58.750
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:30:59.166 --> 01:31:01.583
Let's go.
It's over, let's go back to Paris.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.166
By train?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.333
Can I open the window?

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:31.125
Sure.

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.000
<i>Therefore, in the name
of the French people,</i>

01:32:04.916 --> 01:32:07.750
<i>the court sentences you
to nine years in prison.</i>

01:32:08.875 --> 01:32:11.833
Which you will serve
in the Fleury-Mérogis Penitentiary.

01:32:12.541 --> 01:32:14.250
The session is adjourned.

01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.541
<i>Let's go get Bruno.</i>

01:32:45.833 --> 01:32:48.625
<i>I'll wait for him at 6:00 a.m.
at the heliport.</i>

01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:51.250
<i>Yes, it's my only chance!</i>

01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:54.208
Come on, don't wait.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.707
<i>You have to be drunk always.</i>

01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:10.333
<i>That's everything.
That's the only question.</i>

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:15.082
<i>For you not to feel the horrible
burden of time, breaking your shoulders,</i>

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:19.124
<i>and bending you down to earth,
you must be drunk without respite.</i>

01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.624
<i>But drunk on what?</i>

01:33:20.625 --> 01:33:23.916
<i>Wine, poetry,</i>

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:27.791
<i>Or virtue. At your leisure.</i>

01:33:28.333 --> 01:33:32.082
<i>And if, sometimes, on the steps of a
palace, on the green grass of a ditch,</i>

01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:35.416
<i>in the dreary solitude of your room,
you wake up,</i>

01:33:36.041 --> 01:33:38.875
<i>with your drunkenness
diminished, disappeared,</i>

01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:43.207
<i>ask the wind, the wave,
the star, the bird, the clock,</i>

01:33:43.208 --> 01:33:47.165
<i>all that laughs, all that moans and all
that flees, all that sings, speaks,</i>

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:50.915
<i>ask what time it is, and the wind,
the wave, the bird, the clock</i>

01:33:50.916 --> 01:33:53.375
<i>will answer you:
"'It's time to get drunk.'</i>

01:33:54.291 --> 01:33:56.665
<i>So as not to be time's martyred slaves,</i>

01:33:56.666 --> 01:33:59.125
<i>get drunk, get drunk without respite".</i>
- My love.

01:34:01.208 --> 01:34:04.833
<i>"On wine, poetry, love,</i>

01:34:05.375 --> 01:34:08.250
<i>"or virtue, at your leisure."</i>

01:34:10.375 --> 01:34:12.875
I'm not even there to hold you in my arms.

01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:47.458
Here.

01:35:03.833 --> 01:35:06.458
- You're hungry.
- Jail food...

01:35:07.583 --> 01:35:09.250
I can't even go to the cafeteria.

01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:12.291
- Why?
- Beats me.

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:16.166
They must be scared
I'd hide a saw in coffee grounds.

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.958
I heard about Steve.

01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:31.833
He was executed.
They didn't give him a chance.

01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:36.416
Abolition of the death penalty my ass.

01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:39.416
Do you agree with that?
You and your little colleagues?

01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:41.375
It wasn't my team.

01:35:41.833 --> 01:35:43.291
I handed in my resignation.

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:53.083
- You're not a cop anymore?
- No.

01:35:53.875 --> 01:35:57.250
- Because of that?
- Amongst other things.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.874
Since you're in jail,
I don't feel like chasing anyone else.

01:36:02.875 --> 01:36:05.375
If you think that I'll stay locked up...

01:36:10.416 --> 01:36:12.375
Admit it, you'll miss me.

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:19.791
What are you gonna do now?

01:36:23.041 --> 01:36:27.708
I'm taking some time
to travel, read, write.

01:36:28.375 --> 01:36:32.915
To write detective novels,
that's a retired cop thing.

01:36:32.916 --> 01:36:34.500
Sure, why not?

01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:41.041
Keep your head down.

01:36:43.916 --> 01:36:45.166
Do your time.

01:36:45.916 --> 01:36:48.250
You're still young,
you still have a lot to experience.

01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.666
Why are you telling me this?

01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:55.583
They won't go easy on you
if you go too far.

01:37:01.416 --> 01:37:04.583
You've given me an idea.
Maybe I'll write a book too.

01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:08.083
- About what?
- Freedom.

01:37:08.458 --> 01:37:12.416
Love, the Mediterranean, life.
That's all I'll say or you'll steal it.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.291
Visit's over. Let's go, Sulak.

01:37:23.083 --> 01:37:26.041
I don't even know your first name.

01:37:29.833 --> 01:37:31.083
Georges.

01:37:32.333 --> 01:37:33.958
It's Georges.

01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:38.416
- Bye, Georges.
- Bye, Bruno.

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:42.416
Take care of yourself.

01:37:42.958 --> 01:37:44.499
Oh, you know me.

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.707
Okay, let's go.

01:37:46.708 --> 01:37:50.250
- Sorry, it's not easy here.
- Get up.

01:37:50.791 --> 01:37:52.250
Come on.

01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.833
Will you come back?

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:01.374
- Yes.
- Let's go.

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:02.708
Ciao.

01:38:38.583 --> 01:38:40.625
We'll follow the plan.
I trust you.

01:38:41.166 --> 01:38:43.166
<i>The walkie-talkie and the open door.</i>

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.291
<i>I'm taking a lot of risks for Sulak.</i>

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:56.458
Wait for my last call
and my final instructions. Later.

01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:10.832
Everything's ready, Bruno.
Follow the plan to the letter.

01:39:10.833 --> 01:39:13.875
If there's a problem, get back
to your cell. Good luck.

01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:40.499
I'm in the main corridor.

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.750
<i>Okay, Bruno.</i>

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:04.415
- It's locked.
<i>- It should be open.</i>

01:40:04.416 --> 01:40:05.665
It's closed, what do I do?

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:09.458
<i>I don't understand. I left instructions.
I arranged it all.</i>

01:40:11.458 --> 01:40:13.124
<i>Bruno? I can't hear you.</i>

01:40:13.125 --> 01:40:15.750
<i>If it's not going to plan,
go back to your cell.</i>

01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:37.625
- What do you want?
- Americano, two sugars.

01:40:41.666 --> 01:40:43.500
- Two sugars.
- Yes.

01:41:05.875 --> 01:41:07.416
<i>Bruno?</i>

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.665
Get out.

01:41:17.666 --> 01:41:21.875
Get out of there.
What are you doing with this?

01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:17.291
<i>My love,</i>

01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:20.374
<i>once again, I escaped in my dream</i>

01:42:20.375 --> 01:42:22.666
<i>to fall asleep near your warm body.</i>

01:42:23.958 --> 01:42:25.625
<i>A peaceful feeling.</i>

01:42:26.583 --> 01:42:29.000
<i>Heavy body, light mind.</i>

01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:31.790
<i>I fly, I float.</i>

01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:35.250
<i>I can't feel gravity in the night
that surrounds me with your smell.</i>

01:42:35.833 --> 01:42:37.540
<i>I'm not there anymore.</i>

01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:40.000
<i>I'm disappearing and finally...</i>

01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:43.416
<i>Finally, I find you forever.</i>

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:45.416
<i>Finally.</i>

01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:04.165
<i>It has to end one day.</i>

01:43:04.166 --> 01:43:07.541
<i>Anyway, I would not have made
a very honorable old man.</i>

01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:11.875
<i>But you know, it is my destiny.</i>

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.541
<i>I know that.</i>

01:43:13.666 --> 01:43:15.166
<i>Sometimes,</i>

01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:18.958
<i>I think that this very last escape
will make me</i>

01:43:19.208 --> 01:43:20.666
<i>a free man, forever.</i>

01:43:40.291 --> 01:43:44.625
FREEDOM
