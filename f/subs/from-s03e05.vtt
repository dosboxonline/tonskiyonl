you've been different.

through a tree?

in the forest,

has bottles on it.

Miranda was looking for?

Can you get back there
without the tree?

I don't know.
I don't-- I don't know.

go to the tree.

All right. So, hold on.

and you want to do what?

it again, but I need to see it.

about them?

11:32.109 --> 11:34.402
who are gonna be banging down
your door demanding answers

11:34.403 --> 11:37.071
whether you have them or not.
Take me to the tree.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.615
Let's see if
we can find some.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.826
I told Boyd that I was gonna
go to that town meeting.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.202
Oh, fuck the town meeting!
Sorry.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.288
Uh, okay. Look.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.499
Town meeting isn't gonna
solve anything,

11:48.500 --> 11:50.292
but going to the tree,

11:50.293 --> 11:53.003
at least it's a start.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.841
[grunting]

11:56.842 --> 12:00.052
We had to leave some of the food
back at the settlement.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.515
We, uh, we'll probably need
to send another team out

12:04.516 --> 12:06.308
before the next snowfall.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.978
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

12:10.981 --> 12:11.981
Boyd, there is
something out there,

12:11.982 --> 12:14.567
something different.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.945
We heard it both times now,

12:17.946 --> 12:21.782
walking around
outside the cabins at night.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.076
Okay.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.246
If walking around is
all it's doing,

12:27.247 --> 12:31.083
then, uh, we got
bigger things to worry about.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.711
[scoffs]

12:34.254 --> 12:36.213
[sighs]

12:36.214 --> 12:39.468
[Randall grunting]

12:43.430 --> 12:45.389
What they did to Randall...

12:45.390 --> 12:48.351
Why'd they leave him alive?
Why not just kill him?

12:52.731 --> 12:55.609
[Boyd] I think they
want us to look at him.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.737
When the sun's up,

12:59.738 --> 13:03.699
they want us to remember
what's coming at night.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.951
Part of the thing that
keeps people sane here

13:05.952 --> 13:09.497
is we get to pretend
during the daytime,

13:09.498 --> 13:12.083
pretend that we're safe.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.547
With Randall walking around,

13:18.548 --> 13:20.258
then we don't get
to pretend anymore.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.806
I removed the bullet,
stabilized her.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.183
One minute, she was fine,

13:29.184 --> 13:30.684
and then all of a sudden,
she wasn't.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.646
Jesus.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.855
- [inhales sharply]
- Sorry.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.691
[groans] yeah.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.860
Okay.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.029
God. It's a miracle
there are no fractures.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.783
- Mari.
- Probably have ligament damage.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.202
This should be elevated. I'm
gonna get you another pillow.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.580
Mari, just stop
for a second, please.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.166
Look, last night
wasn't easy,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.626
and it wasn't
your fault, okay?

13:55.627 --> 13:58.921
Yeah, well...
tell that to Nicky.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.381
I'm telling you.

14:00.382 --> 14:04.176
Look. I know what
it's like. I just... [sighs]

14:04.177 --> 14:05.928
I don't--
I don't want you to--

14:05.929 --> 14:06.972
What?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.225
If you think
I'm gonna start spiraling

14:11.226 --> 14:13.143
and stealing morphine
again--

14:13.144 --> 14:15.522
- I didn't--I didn't say that.
- Well, you didn't have to.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.235
- [groans]
- Hey. Come here.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.737
Come here.

14:28.159 --> 14:31.162
Hey, you are
the patient right now.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.039
Can you please just
stop worrying about me

14:34.040 --> 14:35.709
and let me
worry about you?

14:40.088 --> 14:41.589
Can we worry
about each other?

14:41.590 --> 14:42.881
[chuckles]

14:42.882 --> 14:47.303
[Randall groaning in pain]

14:47.304 --> 14:49.138
I gotta go.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.141
- Wait.
- Just get some rest, yeah?

14:52.726 --> 14:53.977
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

14:56.313 --> 14:57.855
[sighs]

14:57.856 --> 15:02.444
[Randall groaning in pain]

15:03.862 --> 15:05.487
- No. Boyd--
- I just wanna help.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.573
I understand that.
Boyd, you being here

15:07.574 --> 15:09.366
is just gonna
make things worse.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.536
[grunting]

15:12.537 --> 15:13.621
I'm sorry.

15:13.622 --> 15:16.040
No. You're right.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.459
Look,
people need you out there.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.587
They're gonna need you at
the meeting later--both of you.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.880
There's only so much
people can take,

15:22.881 --> 15:25.215
and now,
with Tabitha being back,

15:25.216 --> 15:28.594
the fact that she went home--
- [grunting]

15:28.595 --> 15:31.472
- I gotta--
- Yeah.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.724
[groaning]

15:33.725 --> 15:36.644
Hey, Randall. It's okay.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.687
Squeeze my hand.
I'm going to take a look.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.397
- All right.
- Yeah.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.192
[Marielle] Yeah.
You're okay.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.407
This is where he stays...

15:51.284 --> 15:52.285
...most of the time.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.331
Oh.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.929
Uh, it--it's, uh...
[chuckles]

16:11.930 --> 16:13.973
It's a little different from
his room at home. [chuckles]

16:24.150 --> 16:25.485
[exhales deeply]

16:27.445 --> 16:30.948
For the first few years,

16:30.949 --> 16:32.825
every time
I'd turn a corner,

16:32.826 --> 16:36.870
there'd be
this little spark of hope

16:36.871 --> 16:39.998
that maybe, just maybe,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.584
I'd see all of them there--

16:42.585 --> 16:48.507
Miranda, Eloise, Victor.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.345
[stammers] And they--
they'd smile and laugh.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.267
We'd all cry together about what
a terrible mistake it all was.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.104
[chuckles] Then...

17:04.357 --> 17:07.818
That was the hardest part...

17:07.819 --> 17:10.321
that little bit of hope.
[sighs]

17:13.825 --> 17:15.952
That was the part
I-I couldn't bear.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.086
As the years went by,

17:26.087 --> 17:30.716
it became easier
to tell myself they were dead.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.634
They were gone.

17:32.635 --> 17:36.389
So, that's what I did.

17:52.030 --> 17:56.826
All that time,
my little boy was here, alone.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.042
What kind of man gives up
on his family?

18:06.002 --> 18:07.670
No wonder he doesn't wanna
talk to me.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.222
Just give him
a little time.

18:18.807 --> 18:19.848
He'll come 'round.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.558
[exhales deeply]

18:21.559 --> 18:22.976
Sorry to interrupt,

18:22.977 --> 18:26.021
but, uh, we're all
heading to the meeting.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.439
I'll be right there.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.234
Meeting?

18:31.444 --> 18:34.696
People have a lot of questions
about what happened,

18:34.697 --> 18:35.572
about Tabitha.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.825
Sure.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.869
It was kind of a big deal
that she got out of here.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.913
[indistinct conversations]

18:42.914 --> 18:44.832
[Dale] Come on.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.959
Come on!

18:46.960 --> 18:49.127
Okay, everybody,
just take a seat.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.172
- Hey, come on in.
- [Donna] Sit down here. Come on.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.423
[door closes]

18:53.424 --> 18:55.093
[Boyd] Everybody grab--
grab a seat.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.764
All right, everybody.
Okay. All right.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.516
All right. Look.

19:02.517 --> 19:06.061
I understand that everybody
wants answers, right?

19:06.062 --> 19:07.521
- [all chattering]
- So do I, all right?

19:07.522 --> 19:09.106
But the truth is,

19:09.107 --> 19:12.860
there's no easy explanations
to any of this, okay?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.695
- There's nothing that--
- Where the hell is Tabitha?

19:14.696 --> 19:18.323
[all] Yeah. Yeah.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.700
She's coming, all right?

19:19.701 --> 19:21.743
Just try to remember,
she's been through a lot.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.288
All due respect, Boyd, but we've
all been through a lot.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.914
- [woman] That's right.
- [all murmuring]

19:25.915 --> 19:28.000
- I understand that.
- [Dale] Are--are you sure?

19:28.001 --> 19:31.420
'Cause I feel like if you had
any clue about anything,

19:31.421 --> 19:32.421
she'd be the one
talking instead of you.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.214
[all] Yeah.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.716
Look. Everybody
calm the fuck down.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.051
Hey, why were you
in the ambulance?

19:38.052 --> 19:41.388
Well, uh, we were
in an accident.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.474
I was taking Tabitha
to a park near my--

19:44.475 --> 19:45.726
Tabitha's here.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.936
[chattering]

19:50.315 --> 19:52.399
What do I say?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.152
Just tell 'em the truth.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.490
[chattering]

20:00.491 --> 20:01.408
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.410
Yeah.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.790
Did you really
go through a tree?

20:08.791 --> 20:10.375
Hey, let's let her talk.

20:10.376 --> 20:14.463
It's okay. Um, uh, I did. Yes.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.882
Um...

20:18.259 --> 20:20.761
I-I imagine some
of you already know this,

20:20.762 --> 20:23.889
but, um, there are
some trees in the forest

20:23.890 --> 20:25.975
that aren't like
the other trees.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.230
Hey. Town meeting's
already started.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.816
Yeah. I just gotta
grab something.

20:38.112 --> 20:38.988
[door closes]

20:59.467 --> 21:00.677
[knock on door]

21:02.720 --> 21:03.638
Hello?

21:22.365 --> 21:23.657
<i>Why did you bring me here?</i>

21:23.658 --> 21:26.493
[Fatima]
<i>'Cause I wanted you to see</i>

21:26.494 --> 21:30.122
that if you climb
high enough,

21:30.123 --> 21:32.667
even a nightmare can
look like a dream.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.406
Hello?

22:05.700 --> 22:08.201
- [sighs] Hey, Elgin.
- [grunts]

22:08.202 --> 22:10.871
[gasps] Oh, my--
What the fuck?

22:10.872 --> 22:12.998
I'm so sorry. I--
[stammers] I thought you--

22:12.999 --> 22:15.083
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.626
Are you okay?

22:16.627 --> 22:20.798
No. Not really. I...

22:23.384 --> 22:25.219
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, no. Wait.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.014
I could use some company,

22:29.015 --> 22:32.267
if you're not, uh,
you know, busy.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.852
Sure.

22:33.853 --> 22:38.190
Victor?
What are you doing?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.858
It's cold out here.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.527
I never drew
pictures of him.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.863
What?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.699
When I was alone here,
I never...

22:48.159 --> 22:51.119
I always drew pictures
of things that I saw,

22:51.120 --> 22:53.997
because I knew
the pictures would remember,

22:53.998 --> 22:57.626
but I never--
I never drew pictures

22:57.627 --> 22:58.920
of what came before.

23:02.423 --> 23:06.760
And now I told myself
that was a dream and that--

23:06.761 --> 23:09.347
that he was...

23:13.309 --> 23:15.310
Victor...

23:15.311 --> 23:18.021
None of that matters.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.397
- He's here.
- [murmurs]

23:19.398 --> 23:21.733
Somehow,
your father is here,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.318
and he's waiting
for you back in town.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.612
No. No. He's waiting
for a little boy

23:25.613 --> 23:27.448
that drove away
a long time ago.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.913
What's he gonna think...

23:36.415 --> 23:39.001
...when he sees... me?
[sighs]

23:43.214 --> 23:44.215
I don't know.

23:48.719 --> 23:52.430
I know I'm supposed to
tell you that it'll be okay,

23:52.431 --> 23:56.309
and he'll love you
no matter what.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.062
But I don't know if
that's true.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.275
You're really bad at this.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.027
Sorry.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.035
I don't know you that well,

24:14.036 --> 24:16.913
but you seem like
a really good person,

24:16.914 --> 24:19.584
and that's something
to be proud of here.

24:20.877 --> 24:24.797
I would give anything to feel
like a good person again.

24:27.717 --> 24:28.801
Maybe...

24:32.096 --> 24:34.348
Maybe you're not the only one
who's afraid.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.895
Maybe he's afraid
of not being the dad

24:39.896 --> 24:41.564
that little boy remembers.

25:07.632 --> 25:09.007
So, you see this woman
in the kimono

25:09.008 --> 25:10.467
even when you're awake?

25:10.468 --> 25:11.969
Now, I do. Yeah.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.514
Well, is she trying
to hurt you?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.183
I thought she was
at first,

25:18.184 --> 25:20.435
but when I saw her
last night,

25:20.436 --> 25:21.604
she asked
me for my help.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.815
With what?

25:25.816 --> 25:27.525
I don't know.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.653
If my grandma was here,
she'd probably tell me

25:29.654 --> 25:32.072
it was an angel
or somethin'.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.824
"Remember now, there's a reason
why angels say 'Fear not'

25:34.825 --> 25:36.868
when they saw someone.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.578
Even Gabriel was terrifying."

25:38.579 --> 25:41.623
[chuckles] Wow.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.208
Look at you,
Mr. Bible Study.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.044
- [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

25:49.340 --> 25:50.967
You wanna know
the fucked up part?

25:53.803 --> 25:55.929
I would take the creepy
kimono woman in a heartbeat

25:55.930 --> 25:57.973
over the shit
I hear in my head now.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.100
[laughs]

26:00.101 --> 26:01.185
Like what?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.438
Mostly just screaming.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.233
But I don't...

26:08.234 --> 26:09.694
[sighs] I don't just hear it.
It's like...

26:11.946 --> 26:13.197
It's like
I can feel it, too.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.409
This is the only thing
that makes it quiet.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.458
You talk
to your folks about it?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.919
What are they gonna do?
[exhales deeply]

26:27.920 --> 26:30.463
[coughs]

26:30.464 --> 26:32.674
They're in the diner
right now with everyone else,

26:32.675 --> 26:34.301
trying to figure out what
it means that my mom got out.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.593
[scoffs]

26:35.594 --> 26:37.471
What do you think it means?

26:39.348 --> 26:41.058
Honestly, I don't think
it means anything.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.355
I think
this whole place exists...

26:49.692 --> 26:52.110
I think it's just here
to make us suffer.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.988
Maybe that's why it
let her out.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.157
What do you mean?

26:57.158 --> 26:59.327
Best way to make us suffer
is to give us hope.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.416
I don't think
it's ever gonna let us go.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.381
You're so depressing
when you're stoned.

27:13.382 --> 27:16.217
[coughs and laughs]

27:16.218 --> 27:17.594
Sorry.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.555
[laughter]

27:20.556 --> 27:22.140
[Tabitha] And then
the next thing I knew,

27:22.141 --> 27:24.601
um, the ambulance had stopped.

27:24.602 --> 27:27.270
The driver said that there was a
tree in the middle of the road,

27:27.271 --> 27:30.065
and you all know
how things go from there.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.108
Come on in.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.693
- [door closes]
- When you were out there...

27:33.694 --> 27:36.237
did you
contact anyone?

27:36.238 --> 27:38.406
Did you let the police,
anyone know about this place?

27:38.407 --> 27:41.368
- [townspeople] Yes.
- Uh, I-I really wanted to.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.495
- Oh. Are you fucking kidding me?
- [all murmuring]

27:43.496 --> 27:45.830
- Watch your mouth.
- [woman 1] Come on.

27:45.831 --> 27:49.459
- [woman 2] That could be it.
- Um, you don't understand.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.336
They--they wouldn't
have believed me.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.046
Tabitha,
you don't know that.

27:53.047 --> 27:56.383
Look. [grunts] All due respect,
when she told me,

27:56.384 --> 27:58.551
I thought she was
out of her mind.

27:58.552 --> 28:02.180
But you believed her.
Eventually, you believed her.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.558
To be fair,
my circumstances

28:05.559 --> 28:08.478
are a little different
than the average person.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.105
Look.
I-I was in the ambulance

28:10.106 --> 28:11.815
when she was begging us
to turn around,

28:11.816 --> 28:13.525
and we thought
she was hysterical.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.110
What is she
even doing here?

28:15.111 --> 28:17.487
- She killed someone last night.
- [all] Yeah.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.864
- All right. Oh, hey, hey!
- Come on!

28:19.865 --> 28:20.990
Hey! Look.
That was an accident.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.492
- [woman] Accident?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.953
Everything's an accident
unless it's somebody that you

28:24.954 --> 28:27.455
and Queen Bee here don't like.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.290
[Clara] I'm sorry to say this,
but you had an opportunity

28:29.291 --> 28:32.502
that none of us have ever had
before, and you blew it.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.711
- [woman 1] Yeah.
- [woman 2] Wow.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.755
- Excuse me.
- We're just waiting here.

28:35.756 --> 28:38.967
What exactly would you
have done, huh?

28:38.968 --> 28:40.218
What would any of you
have done?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.261
- Hey.
- [Dale] Well, I wouldn't have

28:41.262 --> 28:42.762
taken a day trip to the park.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.557
- [woman] Yeah. Something.
- That's not what it was.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.809
- I wasn't taking a day trip.
- [Fatima] You were out there

28:47.810 --> 28:50.645
in the real world
where people can help.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.856
How could you not take
advantage of that?

28:52.857 --> 28:54.315
- [man] Right.
- Yeah, they may have thought

28:54.316 --> 28:55.900
you were crazy,
but what if they didn't?

28:55.901 --> 28:58.611
What if somebody
believed you?

28:58.612 --> 29:00.613
Well, someone believed me,
and look where he is!

29:00.614 --> 29:02.532
He's sitting
right here with us!

29:02.533 --> 29:05.326
- Tabitha.
- Look. I'm sure everyone

29:05.327 --> 29:07.203
could have done
a better job than what I did,

29:07.204 --> 29:09.915
and I'm so sorry you didn't
have that opportunity.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.668
I'm sorry I don't have
your answers.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.296
I'm--I'm sorry.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.214
I-- I can't do this.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.383
- [woman] Tabitha, please.
- [Dale] Oh, come on!

29:20.384 --> 29:21.384
Not now.
That's enough.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.428
- I can't.
- Oh, my God.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.473
Hey, listen. Listen.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.224
The most important part
of all of this...

29:28.225 --> 29:29.142
- [door closes]
- ...the thing that we cannot

29:29.143 --> 29:32.896
lose sight of is
Tabitha got out.

29:32.897 --> 29:35.064
For all the good
it seems to have done.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.816
No, no, but it's--
it's not about the fact

29:36.817 --> 29:38.526
that she is back here.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.862
It's that someone got home.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.364
It's not just hoping
and wishing anymore.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.701
We have concrete proof now.
It's possible.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.620
Great. Where's the tree?

29:48.621 --> 29:49.954
- What?
- [woman] Really.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.499
Where... is... the... tree?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.334
[townspeople] Yeah!

29:54.335 --> 29:57.962
Everybody just calm down.
Slow down for a second.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.339
We gotta think about this, okay?

29:59.340 --> 30:01.257
Well, what is there
to think about?

30:01.258 --> 30:04.010
Tabitha went through the tree
and got home, right?

30:04.011 --> 30:06.262
Why aren't we all lining up
to do the same?

30:06.263 --> 30:07.805
Because it's not
that simple, okay?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.724
We can't just run out there
into the forest

30:09.725 --> 30:11.309
and hop into the first tree
that we see!

30:11.310 --> 30:12.644
Why not?

30:12.645 --> 30:15.271
Wha-- Excuse me?

30:15.272 --> 30:17.398
[Fatima] I just--
I-- I'm sorry, Boyd.

30:17.399 --> 30:20.276
I don't wanna be here a second
longer than I have to be.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.862
Even--even if there is
the slightest chance

30:22.863 --> 30:26.282
that this tree can get us home,
what are we waiting for?

30:26.283 --> 30:27.992
- Okay. Everybody just--
- [Ellis] No, no, no.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.827
Dad, Dad, she's right, okay?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.913
We can't just sit here and talk
all day--

30:31.914 --> 30:36.125
Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No! Listen! Hey, hey, hey!

30:36.126 --> 30:38.836
You're all assuming that this
tree is some kind of magic door.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.338
It's not.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.048
I went through one
of those trees,

30:42.049 --> 30:44.008
and you know
where I ended up?

30:44.009 --> 30:47.262
In a chimney underground.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.304
Damn near killed myself.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.764
- Look.
- You don't--

30:49.765 --> 30:52.433
It wasn't even the tree
that got her out of here.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.061
She said it was
the lighthouse.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.771
Great. Let's just
get to the lighthouse,

30:56.772 --> 30:58.231
and then we'll go home.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.525
- Listen to me, okay?
- No, you fucking listen!

31:00.526 --> 31:03.027
- Dale, come on!
- No, no, no! I've had it!

31:03.028 --> 31:05.905
I've had it!
Had it with your... plans.

31:05.906 --> 31:08.117
I've had it
with your fucking rules!

31:11.537 --> 31:13.955
I wanna go home!

31:13.956 --> 31:17.333
[all murmuring]

31:17.334 --> 31:20.754
[indistinct conversations]

31:24.842 --> 31:27.635
Why didn't you go
to the meeting?

31:27.636 --> 31:29.887
[liquid pours, clatter]

31:29.888 --> 31:31.889
One thing you'll learn
when you're older,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.934
any meeting with more than three
people is basically pointless.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.603
[door opens]

31:36.604 --> 31:38.313
- [Tabitha] Jade?
- That was quick.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.815
[door closes]

31:41.775 --> 31:43.151
[Jade] How'd it go?

31:43.152 --> 31:44.611
[Jim] Uh, uh...

31:44.612 --> 31:45.903
Huh?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.030
Not great.

31:47.031 --> 31:47.947
See?

31:47.948 --> 31:49.407
We're going to the tree.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.701
- Finally.
- Wait. What?

31:51.702 --> 31:54.495
I have nothing to tell them,
Jim. They're right.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.497
I went out. I went out,
and I came back.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.666
And I came back with nothing.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.501
I owe it to them.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.545
[scoffs] You <i>owe?</i>

32:02.546 --> 32:03.880
- Yes.
- Tabitha, you just got back,

32:03.881 --> 32:05.423
and now you wanna
go back out there?

32:05.424 --> 32:06.924
It's not like she's
gonna go in the tree.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.343
- Exactly.
- Would you just stay outta this?

32:08.344 --> 32:11.346
- I wanna go, too.
- No! Nobody is going to a tree.

32:11.347 --> 32:14.599
Jim!

32:14.600 --> 32:15.642
- I need to speak with you...
- Yeah.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.769
...for a minute, please.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.687
[sighs]

32:19.688 --> 32:22.148
You need to think
about what you're doing.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.192
- I am.
- [scoffs]

32:24.193 --> 32:27.278
We thought you were dead.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.989
Your children thought
you were dead.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.741
You think I give a shit
about what you owe

32:31.742 --> 32:33.201
to these people
in a diner?

32:33.202 --> 32:34.994
You owe it to your kids
to be here now.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.622
I'm just gonna show him
where the tree is.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.292
That's all.
I'm not gonna go in.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.170
I'll be back. I promise.

32:45.756 --> 32:49.717
Fine, but Ethan--
he stays here with me.

32:49.718 --> 32:53.179
Do you know he ran off looking
for you when you were gone?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.556
Do you really wanna
take him out there

32:55.557 --> 32:57.768
and show him where the--
the magic tree is?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.063
- Okay.
- Yeah.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:07.111 --> 33:10.363
Ethan, you're gonna stay here
with your father, okay?

33:10.364 --> 33:14.158
- But I wanna help.
- You're helping by staying here.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.203
I'll be back soon. Let's go.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.707
I'll get my coat.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.627
[door opens]

33:24.920 --> 33:26.337
Dad.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.547
[indistinct conversations]

33:27.548 --> 33:28.589
Hey!

33:28.590 --> 33:29.550
Stop, Dad!

33:30.884 --> 33:33.845
Come on. Hey! Hey!

33:33.846 --> 33:34.887
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.180
- What?
- We are sitting

33:36.181 --> 33:37.557
on a powder keg in there,

33:37.558 --> 33:39.267
and you and Fatima
are lighting matches.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.476
- She's upset.
- Oh, yeah?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.520
Well, guess what?
We're all fucking upset.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.648
What we need to do
is calm people down.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.608
Okay, or maybe what we need is
for someone around here

33:47.609 --> 33:49.527
to start doing something
instead of sitting around

33:49.528 --> 33:51.571
worrying about what
could go wrong.

33:51.572 --> 33:52.822
Is that what I'm doing?
I'm just--

33:52.823 --> 33:54.574
I'm just sitting around.
Is that it, huh?

33:54.575 --> 33:56.576
Maybe what we need is
to start taking chances.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.412
Oh, you wanna take
some chances. Okay.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.456
Who--who--who you
wanna take a chance on?

34:01.457 --> 34:04.041
Whose life are you willing
to take a chance to gamble on?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.585
You know that's not
what I'm saying.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.629
No, no! Tell me,
'cause I wanna know!

34:08.630 --> 34:10.047
Who we gonna march
out there next?

34:10.048 --> 34:11.924
Huh? Huh?

34:11.925 --> 34:14.594
You wanna do something, right?
So tell me! Who's next?

34:14.595 --> 34:17.806
Who's your pick?!

34:19.516 --> 34:20.517
Exactly.

34:22.102 --> 34:26.314
What happened in there...
is a dangerous thing.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.816
It's a dangerous...

34:41.163 --> 34:43.915
I never realized
all this stuff was down here.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.417
Yeah. Uh,
this is where they store

34:46.418 --> 34:48.295
the surplus of weird.

34:49.296 --> 34:53.382
Oh. Uh, I couldn't
sleep one night,

34:53.383 --> 34:55.093
and, uh, I found this.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.723
Oh, my God.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.393
Oh. This is, like...

35:04.394 --> 35:06.479
It's, like,
the vintage motherlode.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.315
Oh, no. No. It's not
just vintage.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.566
This shit is, uh...

35:10.567 --> 35:11.985
This is '80s vintage.

35:15.906 --> 35:18.074
Can you imagine people
running through the woods

35:18.075 --> 35:20.868
in, like,
fluorescent spandex?

35:20.869 --> 35:23.287
With their big-ass hair
getting caught in the branches?

35:23.288 --> 35:24.331
[laughs]

35:26.625 --> 35:27.876
Oh. Hold on.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.755
Oh. Oh, no way.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.006
