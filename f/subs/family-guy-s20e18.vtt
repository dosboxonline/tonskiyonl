I'm home from camp.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.747
- Welcome home.
- Meg's been wearing your clothes.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.835
Ah, my big man.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.503
How was Camp Angry Indian?

00:45.587 --> 00:47.922
Oh, they had to rename it Camp Redface.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.717
Then soon after,
Camp Washington Football Team.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.470
But camp was awesome.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.055
I got a girlfriend.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.598
She's smoking hot,

00:56.598 --> 00:59.184
and she has some off the charts
scary political views,

00:59.184 --> 01:01.227
but largely because
of the smoking hot thing,

01:01.311 --> 01:03.146
we've decided to stay together.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.315
My boy has a girlfriend?

01:05.315 --> 01:07.400
Oh, Chris, that's amazing.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.403
Good job, Chris.
You've really impressed your old dad.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.031
Like Richard Gere's gerbil
impressed his dad.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.992
Hello?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
<i>GERBIL SON
Dad, you're never gonna believe</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.788

01:26.461 --> 01:28.505

01:28.505 --> 01:30.173
Yeah, right. I'll show him.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.550
Whoa, since when do you have a treadmill?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.552
I took it from a Curves.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.262
They mostly just lie on mats.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.351
Brian, help!

01:42.685 --> 01:44.479
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.815
- Bizarro <i>Family Guy?</i>
- Bizarro <i>Family Guy.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.691
It's just the fire.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.868
Peter, how is a stud finder
gonna help with this?

02:01.371 --> 02:04.415
Beep, beep, beep.
Looks like I found the stud.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.545
Oh, I know we have our differences,

02:08.545 --> 02:11.714
but stuff like that, it-it...
man, it's just...

02:11.798 --> 02:13.424
I just... it's-it's fun.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.010
Enough, Peter. I'm calling a handyman.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.805
Fine. What's in here, anyway?

02:20.473 --> 02:21.975
- Bizarro Peter?
- Bizarro Peter.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.810
It's just that I'm reading.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.400
Peter, how many times
do I have to tell you

02:30.400 --> 02:32.277
to stop leaving your wet swimsuit

02:32.277 --> 02:33.695
at the bottom of the stairs?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.738
I never know
when I'll be back in the sprinklers.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.408
I got to be able to grab and go
when they start spraying.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.910
Ugh, you're impossible.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.370
See that, Chris?

02:42.370 --> 02:45.123
In the Hungry Hungry Hippos
game of marriage,

02:45.123 --> 02:47.292
I just ate one of her marbles.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.752
I don't think you should
be proud of that, Dad.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.255
- Excuse me?
- Let me give you a nickel's worth

02:52.255 --> 02:55.508
of free advice from one
happily taken man to another.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.177
We've got two of these

02:57.177 --> 02:59.053
and only one of these,

02:59.137 --> 03:02.223
so we should listen
twice as much as we talk.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.894
Remember, Dad,
never question your wife's choices.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.522
After all, you were one of them.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.274
I love cooking with wine.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.484
Sometimes, I even put it in the food.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.446
Are you just quoting aprons
you saw in a kitchen magazine?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.865
The last few, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:18.865 --> 03:21.075
I have a Chaturbate date with my love.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.244
Isn't it hard to find each other on there?

03:23.328 --> 03:26.080
Yeah, but that's part of the dance.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.920
Hey, Jerome, could I get
a Twisted Tea over here?

03:31.920 --> 03:35.840
Uh-oh. Never a good sign
when a guy strays from linear tea.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.468
- Everything okay, Peter?
- Eh, it's just Chris.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.887
Ever since he got a girlfriend,
he's been insufferable.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.972
Chris got a lady? That's great.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.849
Do we know anything about this girl?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.352
All I know is he met her at camp
and she's from Canada.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.479
Trouble.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.397
Have you seen Chris FaceTime her

03:51.481 --> 03:53.149
or heard her on the phone or anything?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.817
- No, why?
- Peter,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.277
I don't know how to say this,

03:56.361 --> 03:58.196
but Canada is kind of a red flag.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.073
Yeah, and white,
with a big leaf in the middle.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.741
You're awesome at flags. So what?

04:01.741 --> 04:04.244
I hear Canada has
a pretty handsome prime minister.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.745
It's Tru-deau.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.248
Think about it, Peter,
a Canadian camp girlfriend

04:08.248 --> 04:09.832
nobody has ever seen?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.459
Seems a bit suspicious to me.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.086
What, you think he made her up?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.796
Chris wouldn't lie about this.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.006
You'd be surprised
at what people lie about.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.634
Cleveland claims he likes Miller Lite
because it tastes great.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.511
- It does.
- It's less filling.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.096
- Tastes great.
- Less filling!

here to fix the...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.586
Bocce balls!

05:00.383 --> 05:03.177
Hi there, young lady.
I'm Jamie the Handyman.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.763
I heard you had a hole
that needed to be filled.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.808
Yes.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.310
Is that a big job?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.103
Nothing my caulk can't handle.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.188
So you just...

05:14.272 --> 05:16.524
fill the hole with your caulk?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.818
Yes, it's very thick,

05:18.818 --> 05:20.611
and it stays hard forever.

<i>Repeat, we have liftoff.</i>

05:48.973 --> 05:50.350
I didn't say you could be in this.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.353
Well, it's still a bit moist,
but should dry up soon.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.937
Don't count on it.

05:55.021 --> 05:55.980
- What's that?
- Nothing.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.732
Hey, um, I was hoping

05:57.732 --> 05:59.317
maybe you could come back tomorrow

05:59.317 --> 06:02.904
and fix our... sink or-or something?

06:02.904 --> 06:05.656
Well, I usually charge
a minimum of two hours, so...

06:05.740 --> 06:08.534
why don't you call me when
you have a few things for me to...

06:14.916 --> 06:17.251
Okay, so for tomorrow,

06:17.335 --> 06:18.836
could you fix a few windows,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.797
a door ripped off its hinges

06:20.797 --> 06:23.091
and a thermostat
that was smashed with a...

06:23.091 --> 06:25.301
Fire poker.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.553
Whoa, talk about flaming hot.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.642
Aah!

06:32.642 --> 06:34.352
Still getting used to that.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.818
Peter, the stairs are all wet
from your swimsuit aga...

06:44.362 --> 06:46.739
Put these in the shower.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.035
Lois, I work hard to keep this family

06:51.119 --> 06:53.704
in wet bathing suits,
and at the end of the day,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.998
all I want is to come home, relax,

06:56.082 --> 06:58.501
do a couple of rad jumps
through Sprinkler City,

06:58.501 --> 07:00.586
and then enjoy a Popsicle
on the front steps

07:00.670 --> 07:01.838
while I look at bugs.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.756
We don't deserve this guy.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.967
Hey, Dad? Rule number one,

07:05.967 --> 07:07.718
your wife is always right.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.221
Rule number two, if your wife is wrong,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.265
please refer to rule number one.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.601
I got to text that to my girl later.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.936
Why not right now?

07:16.936 --> 07:19.397
Oh, she's probably eating dinner,

07:19.397 --> 07:21.816
and we believe family time is special.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.734
Uh-huh. So, Chris,

07:23.818 --> 07:26.070
what's this "girl's" name, anyway?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.905
Jennifaire.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.407
Well, I'd love to see

07:29.407 --> 07:31.993
Jennifaire's Facebook page.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.579
Oh, we don't really
believe in social media,

07:34.579 --> 07:36.914
but I can show you a picture.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.750
What is this?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.752
It's an ad for Tim Hortons in Canada.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.171
She's a model for them.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.923
She gets her weight in coffee
free every month.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.759
- That's too much coffee.
- I also love coffee.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.596
It's important in relationships
to have shared interests.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.347
You could learn from that, Dad.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.683
Look, I may have relationship problems,

07:55.683 --> 07:57.768
but at least I have a real relationship.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.479
What are you saying?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.647
You don't have a girlfriend.
You made her up.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.858
No, I didn't. She's real.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.110
She's real, huh?
Well, then, let's go see her.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.863
You and I are going to Canada
first thing in the morning.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.908
Peter, don't forget,
you get the flu shot tomorrow morning.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.201
We're going to Canada right now.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.452
And then, after,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.204
you're supposed
to have your prostate exam.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.830
Tomorrow afternoon, we go to Canada.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.957
And then on Friday,
we refill your Percocet prescription.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.211
Sometime next week, we're going to Canada.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.343
Peter, this is ridiculous.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.220
You don't have to drive
all the way to Canada

08:32.220 --> 08:33.638
just to prove a point.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.140
Don't worry, Lois,
he's gonna crack way before that.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.434
Well, at least bring this thick sweater.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.728
Canada is its only chance to get out.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.396
Larry!

08:42.480 --> 08:45.358
See you on the other side, boys,
and when I get there,

08:45.358 --> 08:47.068
I'll send you a cable.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.502
look long and sexy.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.379
Long legs, huh?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.694
Everything okay?

09:29.694 --> 09:33.364

09:42.540 --> 09:46.043
What are you talking
about? You've got Dad. Jamie's mine.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.755
Look, your dad's away,
and it's time to load up my spank bank.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.383
All I need is one hug
with a lower-back brush

09:52.383 --> 09:54.927
and a sniff of the neck,
and I'm good for six years.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.929
It's not happening, old lady.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.473
Meg, I'm warning you,
if you don't back off,

09:59.557 --> 10:01.142
I will end you.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.518
You wouldn't dare.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.447
Only 100,000 meters to Canada.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.073
You stuck to your guns.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.367
No shame in admitting
there's no girlfriend now.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.953
I'm not admitting something
that's not true.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.581
Well, hey, because you definitely
have a girlfriend,

10:23.581 --> 10:25.958
maybe you can tell me
how you take a bra off.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.918
You just start blindly tugging

10:28.002 --> 10:30.463
until they sigh and do it themselves.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.215
Been watching your old man, huh?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.302
Well, it sounds like you're
quite the relationship expert.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.596
I'm sure you can tell me what sex is like.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.640
I could, or maybe

10:40.640 --> 10:43.517
you could tell me what sex is like.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.229
Oh, I could for sure tell you
exactly what sex is like.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.747
<i>You got something for me ♪</i>

11:04.747 --> 11:08.292
<i>♪ Oh, I got a brand-new
pair of roller skates</i> ♪

11:08.376 --> 11:11.295
<i>You got a brand-new key. ♪</i>

11:12.672 --> 11:15.466
Jamie will be here any minute
to start on some repairs.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.551
I don't want any more drama, Meg.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.178
You won't get any from me.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.182
Hey, there's the birthday girl.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.935
What? What are you talking about?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.274
Hi. I'm with Kassabian Sheep Shearing.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.360
I'm here to shave Meg's back.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.618
So, my doctor was like,
"Oh, my gosh, you're so young

11:42.702 --> 11:45.037
you should probably
be going to a pediatrician."

11:45.121 --> 11:46.539
A baby doctor?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.250
Yeah, no, j-just as a joke
because, you know,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.210
I seem so young, I think.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.629
Hey, Mom, I'm doing a school report.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.464
Who was president when you were born?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.134
Uh, Dwight D. Ei... Oh, you bitch.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.594
Clinton. Dwight D. Clinton.

12:00.678 --> 12:04.598
<i>I did not have sexual relations
with that woman</i>

12:04.682 --> 12:06.726
<i>because I am extremely old</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:09.103
<i>and have a windsock penis.</i>

12:12.606 --> 12:14.900
Look, I know
how attached you are to your girl,

12:14.984 --> 12:18.946
but I for one am very curious
to see a Canadian strip club.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.619
<i>Fellas,
put your mittens together for Brandi.</i>

12:44.555 --> 12:46.599
God, just imagine when she takes off

12:46.599 --> 12:48.434
her middle pair of socks.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.394
Dad, what are we even doing here?

12:50.478 --> 12:52.480
I'm in a committed relationship.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.648
Geez, relax. I figured
maybe you'd like seeing

12:54.732 --> 12:55.858
a real girl or two.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.151
Real girl?

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
I can't believe you still won't accept

12:58.986 --> 13:00.488
that I have a girlfriend.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.573
It's just, it's just, it's not adding up.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.993
Oh, please. Mom's way out of your league,

13:05.993 --> 13:08.662
so why can't you get it
through your thick and huge head

13:08.746 --> 13:10.456
that I found someone great?

13:10.456 --> 13:13.334
Head's not that huge,
and Mom is not way out of my league.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.461
We both have strengths
and weaknesses as people.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.172
Shut up. You're the luckiest guy on earth.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.508
Mom's hot and does everything.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.551
You're not hot and do nothing.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.804
You know why I don't
believe you have a girlfriend?

13:24.804 --> 13:27.765
- Why?
- Because you're a fat loser.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.561
I hate you.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.064
Aw, Chris, I didn't mean...

13:35.064 --> 13:38.901
Oh, no, I probably just
ruined his self-esteem forever.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.654
<i>Please welcome our next dancer,</i>

13:41.654 --> 13:43.656
<i>Chris Griffin.</i>

13:43.656 --> 13:48.160
This is because of you, Daddy.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.962
Come on, Chris, get in the car.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.006
No. You called me a fat loser.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.510
Yeah, like P-H, phat, and P-H, loser.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.972
Okay, I didn't want to resort to this,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.307
but I have a Mountain Dew
with limited-edition

14:10.391 --> 14:12.351
X Games packaging in here.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.646
You're playing dirty pool.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.399
As a teen, I'm required
to be excited by that.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.362
Wow, flatland skateboarder Rodney Mullen.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.200
Ah.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.995
As soon as I finish this bottle
and then bring it home

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
to put on a display shelf in my room,

14:33.122 --> 14:35.583
I'm going back to walk on the road.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.088
Hey, Jamie.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.257
I just baked some cookies
when you're ready for a break.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.342
Man, you guys are spoiling me.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.469
Let me work on these gutters first.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.420
I'm okay.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.588
Oh, thank God.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.967
Oh, my God, Jamie.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.302
Ja...

15:28.302 --> 15:31.639
It's out. It's out. It's very out.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.978
And as they say,

15:38.062 --> 15:40.064
when God takes a handyman,

15:40.064 --> 15:42.232
he must need a cloud fixed.

15:42.316 --> 15:46.028
We miss you, Jamie.
Our Carhartts are broken.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.949
Now, please join us
for an Arby's catered reception.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.660
We ask that you leave
your cups and cigarette butts

15:52.660 --> 15:55.245
on the ground or in attic crawl spaces

15:55.329 --> 15:57.498
to be found years later.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.632
I-I can't... You look so much like him.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.258
Jamie was my twin brother.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.803
Oh, you must be so sad.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.888
Are you also a handyman?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.640
No, I'm an inner thigh masseuse,

16:14.640 --> 16:16.558
specializing in moms in their 40s.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.270
You must need a hug.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.071
In Florida, which is where
I'm headed back to now.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.781
Nice meeting you.

16:33.742 --> 16:37.287
Sorry, bro.
Three's a tough number for travel.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.549
Maybe we should try the radio.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.884
<i>You're listening
to Canadian Sports Talk Radio.</i>

16:50.968 --> 16:52.720
<i>How aboot our teams, eh?</i>

16:52.720 --> 16:54.805
<i>They're all oot there trying super hard,</i>

16:54.805 --> 16:56.515
<i>and that's what matters most.</i>

16:56.515 --> 16:58.559
<i>DJ 2: Yeah, outstanding effort all around.</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:00.102
<i>What a neat group of guys.</i>

17:00.102 --> 17:01.520
<i>DJ 1: Great point, bud.</i>

17:01.520 --> 17:04.273
<i>The players are nice,
and coach does the best he can...</i>

17:04.273 --> 17:05.899
Bunch of bums.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.074
- You okay?
- What do you care?

17:18.996 --> 17:21.331
I'm sorry for calling you a fat loser.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.709
It really hurt my feelings.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.335
Why would you do that?

17:25.419 --> 17:27.755
Well, this is hard for me to admit, but...

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
I used to be a fat loser.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.632
What?

17:30.716 --> 17:31.967
In high school,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.969
I said I had a hot Canadian girlfriend

17:34.053 --> 17:36.221
and that she was
the Vanna White of Canada.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.348
Nobody believed me,
so I made up a game show

17:38.432 --> 17:40.309
at an all-school assembly to prove it.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.771
Okay, so earlier,
you said the winner of round one

17:43.771 --> 17:45.773
is immune from the sudden death round?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.400
- They are.
- But our handout says the sudden death round

17:48.484 --> 17:50.360
is part of the champions circle,

17:50.444 --> 17:52.112
which determines the winner.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.740
So, the round one winner
can't win the game?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.834
Eventually, it all worked out.
I met your mom,

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
I Brett Kavanaugh-ed her up some stairs

18:08.045 --> 18:09.838
and accidentally had Meg.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.091
But high school was
a rough couple of years.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.718
Wow, Dad, I-I had no idea.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.678
I never told anyone that story.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.972
I just wanted to save you
from some of the pain

18:19.056 --> 18:20.766
and humiliation I went through.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.559
You and I are a lot alike.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.894
You think so?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.604
I know so.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.481
I sure do love you, son.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.274
I love you, too, Dad.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.283
- This the spot?
- Looks like it.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.410
I'm proud of you
for standing up for yourself

18:40.494 --> 18:41.787
about your girlfriend.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.580
I'm glad we took this trip together.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.165
Me, too, Dad.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.260
Hey, Dad, I just wanted to say thanks.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.656
There's no girlfriend.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.783
I made the whole thing up.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.245
I guess we're both
a couple of fat losers, huh, Dad?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.788
It's okay, buddy.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.415
And what do you say we head home?

19:26.415 --> 19:28.167
And on the way, we can even watch

19:28.167 --> 19:29.835
that new Pixar movie, <i>Sweaters.</i>

19:29.835 --> 19:33.380
- Another home run?
- You bet it might be.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.737
Well, that was quite an adventure,

19:56.737 --> 19:58.363
but I'm happy to be home.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.241
- I'm happy you're back, too.
- Where's Dad?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.036
Oh, he had his 25th high school reunion.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
And then whoever has the most points

20:06.038 --> 20:08.207
is named the "Moose with the Most."

20:08.207 --> 20:09.666
Any questions?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.002
Yeah, if the show
was so popular in Canada,

20:12.002 --> 20:14.463
how come they never
showed reruns in the States?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.965
Good question. It was created by the CBC,

20:17.049 --> 20:20.093
which is a pipeline to the BBC,
which ran it quite regularly,

20:20.177 --> 20:22.221
but that preexisted BBC America,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.473
so there was no U.S. system in place. Next.

20:24.473 --> 20:28.227
Yeah, say you win a trip
in the Moose Pit Challenge,

20:28.227 --> 20:31.939
but you're unable to go
due to some previous conflict?

20:31.939 --> 20:34.274
You have one calendar year
to take the trip.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.069
And if you win the Cash Bash,
are you taxed on your winnings?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.780
You have to declare the gross amount
on your taxes that year.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.698
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah, makes sense.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.034
Guys, I've had 25 years to perfect this.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.703
- You're not gonna stump me.
- Yeah, you said it was the best-rated show

20:46.787 --> 20:49.706
in Nunavut in the '90s,
but Nunavut wasn't separated

20:49.790 --> 20:52.834
from the Northwest Territories until 1999.
