from England in 1771,

Please save your questions
for the end.

02:57.678 --> 03:02.014
In 1776, Pat refused to sign
the Declaration of Independence,

03:02.090 --> 03:04.382
saying the only thing
we need independence from

03:04.459 --> 03:05.851
is wives who won't let us drink.

He left Philadelphia, uttering
several anti-Italian slurs

03:09.248 --> 03:11.339
on his way out of town,
all of which are true.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.508

realize Philadelphia is built

11:39.925 --> 11:41.366
There's a flight of stairs
to get in.

Okay, we should probably
Airbnb another place.

-100% in.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.457
the Constitution says nothing
to protect gay marriage.

Yes! Fetuses will be

But also, all people are equal

19:53.084 --> 19:55.251
A toast to Peter Griffin,

19:55.253 --> 19:57.753
who brought some common sense
to this court.

19:57.755 --> 19:59.939
I didn't.
Beer did.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.090
Thanks, booze.

20:01.092 --> 20:03.034
Hey, this is non-alcoholic.

20:03.185 --> 20:04.518
I've learned my lesson.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.537
I've listened,
grown and changed.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.164
I swear on the Bible.

20:11.452 --> 20:12.210
[thud]

20:12.286 --> 20:13.711
[insects trilling]

20:17.199 --> 20:19.300
Son of a bitch
slipped me a Mickey.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.724
I'm proud of you, Peter.

20:26.801 --> 20:30.152
I don't know how you did it,
but you preserved gay marriage.

20:30.154 --> 20:31.729
Oh, I just told them
how happy we are,

20:31.731 --> 20:34.306
and how everyone
deserves that for themselves.

20:34.383 --> 20:37.050
-Aw.
-Well, like every
political figure

20:37.128 --> 20:38.885
with a conflicted
conscience in movies,

20:38.963 --> 20:41.906
I now have to go spend a night
at the Lincoln Memorial.

20:41.983 --> 20:44.558
I wish I knew
what you were thinking.

20:44.635 --> 20:47.227
Did they invent
bulletproof theater helmets yet?

20:47.305 --> 20:49.247
No, we just accept
that anyone could get shot

20:49.323 --> 20:50.806
anywhere at any time.

20:50.808 --> 20:53.476
Well, as long as
my beloved Republican party

20:53.478 --> 20:56.754
is still upholding
the traditions of Honest Abe.

20:56.831 --> 20:59.006
[sad trombone plays]
