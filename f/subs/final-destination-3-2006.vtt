WEBVTT

02:36.387 --> 02:40.016
Aah!

02:43.861 --> 02:46.386
- Whoo!
- Ha ha ha!

02:46.430 --> 02:48.398
Aah!

02:48.432 --> 02:49.956
Oh, man! Heh heh.

02:51.201 --> 02:52.463
- Did you see that?
- Woo!

02:55.773 --> 02:57.400
Oh, my God. Ha ha!

02:57.441 --> 02:59.466
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.841
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

03:00.878 --> 03:01.867
Oh, babe. You missed out.

03:01.912 --> 03:02.901
Yes!

03:02.947 --> 03:05.347
I want to get off.

03:16.961 --> 03:18.758
Whoo! Ow!

03:18.796 --> 03:19.956
Ha ha ha!

03:19.997 --> 03:21.328
That was intense, man.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.595
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

03:23.634 --> 03:26.432
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

03:26.470 --> 03:28.597
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

03:28.639 --> 03:30.436
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

03:30.474 --> 03:31.873
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

03:31.909 --> 03:33.103
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

03:33.143 --> 03:34.132
- OK!
- All right?

03:34.178 --> 03:35.145
So let's go.

03:35.179 --> 03:37.670
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

03:37.715 --> 03:40.377
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

03:40.417 --> 03:42.851
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

03:42.886 --> 03:46.014
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

03:46.056 --> 03:47.250
Ha ha ha!

04:03.140 --> 04:04.471
- Unh!
- Ha ha!

04:04.508 --> 04:05.805
Oh, I'll take that.

04:05.843 --> 04:07.470
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

04:07.511 --> 04:08.842
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

04:08.879 --> 04:09.846
Ha ha!

04:09.880 --> 04:11.541
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

04:11.582 --> 04:14.380
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

04:14.418 --> 04:16.283
Ha ha!

04:16.320 --> 04:17.514
- Ow!
- Nice.

04:17.553 --> 04:20.250
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

04:20.290 --> 04:21.654
Ha ha!

04:21.692 --> 04:23.523
These are for the yearbook.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.687
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

04:25.729 --> 04:28.755
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

04:28.799 --> 04:29.959
is gonna make it in there.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.092
Whew. I'd buy two.

04:31.135 --> 04:32.397
Ha ha ha!

04:32.436 --> 04:33.801
Number 38, your order's ready.

04:33.837 --> 04:35.862
That's us.

04:35.906 --> 04:37.373
I am so sorry.

04:37.408 --> 04:38.966
Kevin can get so out of control.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.910
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

04:41.945 --> 04:44.345
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

04:44.381 --> 04:47.145
like I couldn't handle that.

04:50.821 --> 04:52.083
I'm breaking up with him.

04:52.122 --> 04:55.182
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

04:55.225 --> 04:56.556
I've been wanting to for a while.

04:56.593 --> 04:59.187
But don't tell anybody, OK?

04:59.229 --> 05:00.526
Whoa. Ha ha!

05:00.564 --> 05:03.328
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

05:04.334 --> 05:05.858
- I love it.
- I love it.

05:05.903 --> 05:10.237
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

05:10.274 --> 05:11.764
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

05:11.809 --> 05:14.209
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.269
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

05:16.313 --> 05:18.178
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

05:19.383 --> 05:20.782
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

05:20.818 --> 05:22.046
You're totally winning.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.144
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

05:23.187 --> 05:25.553
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

05:25.589 --> 05:27.887
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

05:28.592 --> 05:30.753
Aah! Aah!

05:30.794 --> 05:32.853
- I won!
- I knew you would.

05:32.896 --> 05:35.524
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.090
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

05:37.134 --> 05:38.192
Ashley.

05:41.338 --> 05:43.238
Woo! Ha ha!

05:43.273 --> 05:46.800
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

05:48.412 --> 05:50.437
- You like that?
- Ha ha!

05:50.481 --> 05:53.382
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

05:53.417 --> 05:55.282
Whoo-ooh!

05:55.319 --> 05:56.581
Sam!

06:02.159 --> 06:03.683
Excuse me.

06:05.796 --> 06:07.127
You're not a senior.

06:07.164 --> 06:08.563
And what are
you gonna do about it...

06:08.599 --> 06:11.830
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah? Ha ha!

06:11.869 --> 06:13.598
Mom know you're here?

06:15.139 --> 06:17.334
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

06:17.374 --> 06:19.308
Proof where you were.

06:19.343 --> 06:20.970
Take a shot of this.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.239
Ha ha ha!

06:29.319 --> 06:30.877
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

06:30.921 --> 06:32.786
# That is three, number three #

06:32.823 --> 06:35.724
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

06:35.759 --> 06:36.919
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

06:36.960 --> 06:39.121
What you doin'?
Get the fuck back. Hoo!

06:39.163 --> 06:41.461
My God, I am good. Here we go.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.864
Boy, I'll tell ya...
Goddamn. Whoo!

06:43.901 --> 06:45.698
Kind sir, step right up!

06:45.736 --> 06:47.704
There ya go. Whaddaya want?

06:47.738 --> 06:50.138
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

06:50.174 --> 06:51.835
Here we go. Here we go.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.035
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

06:53.076 --> 06:54.100
Unh!

06:56.980 --> 06:58.641
Ho ho ho!

06:58.682 --> 07:00.582
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

07:00.617 --> 07:02.346
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

07:02.386 --> 07:03.410
That's the one we gonna get.

07:05.923 --> 07:08.551
Ha ha ha!

07:10.994 --> 07:15.829
Ha ha ha ha!

07:15.866 --> 07:21.304
You can run, but you cannot hide.

07:21.338 --> 07:23.306
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.364
- Yes!
- Whoo!

07:24.408 --> 07:26.433
- There it is.
- Awesome.

07:26.476 --> 07:28.341
Here, get a pic of this. Ahhh!

07:28.378 --> 07:31.142
This is the beginning of the end.

07:32.216 --> 07:34.207
Ha ha ha!

07:34.251 --> 07:36.446
Hey, guys, get in line.

07:41.091 --> 07:43.286
Let's go on again!

07:43.327 --> 07:44.351
What's wrong?

07:45.963 --> 07:47.828
I'm...

07:47.865 --> 07:50.026
I was having that feeling
like dejรก vu, you know?

07:50.067 --> 07:53.366
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

07:53.403 --> 07:54.461
Hey, J.

07:54.504 --> 07:55.732
Come on, man, let's go.

07:55.772 --> 07:57.763
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.275
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

08:01.078 --> 08:04.138
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

08:04.181 --> 08:05.739
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

08:05.782 --> 08:08.410
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

08:08.452 --> 08:11.751
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

08:11.788 --> 08:14.916
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

08:14.958 --> 08:17.620
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

08:17.661 --> 08:19.151
Never.

08:20.430 --> 08:21.590
OK.

08:21.632 --> 08:25.363
You can run, but you cannot hide.

08:25.402 --> 08:28.098
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

08:28.138 --> 08:30.106
Ha... cup them slightly...

08:30.140 --> 08:32.539
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

08:32.576 --> 08:34.407
And we'd wanna do that why?

08:34.443 --> 08:36.775
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

08:36.813 --> 08:38.075
I'm lookin' at one right now.

08:38.115 --> 08:42.643
Ha ha!
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

08:42.686 --> 08:44.950
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

08:44.988 --> 08:46.785
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

08:46.823 --> 08:49.189
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

08:49.226 --> 08:51.091
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

08:51.128 --> 08:53.119
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

08:53.163 --> 08:57.361
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

08:57.401 --> 08:58.595
Ha ha ha ha!

08:58.635 --> 09:00.762
You're totally sad.

09:02.506 --> 09:06.442
Try not to scream!

09:06.476 --> 09:09.411
Ha ha ha!

09:12.950 --> 09:14.850
That was totally awesome!

09:14.885 --> 09:16.216
Yeah! Sweet!

09:40.777 --> 09:42.142
You all right?

09:42.179 --> 09:44.477
There's nothing to worry about.

09:44.514 --> 09:46.709
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.776
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.947
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

09:51.989 --> 09:53.320
of dying in a roller coaster.

09:53.357 --> 09:55.689
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

09:55.726 --> 09:58.024
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

09:58.061 --> 10:00.052
than dying at one.

10:01.832 --> 10:03.823
Whoo! Heh.

10:10.407 --> 10:11.806
Here we go.

10:14.478 --> 10:16.343
Whoo!

10:18.582 --> 10:20.174
You like this?

10:20.217 --> 10:22.811
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

10:22.853 --> 10:26.448
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

10:26.490 --> 10:29.220
I like this. It's old school.

10:29.259 --> 10:32.285
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

10:32.329 --> 10:36.129
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.155
Ew.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.100
Oh! Let's go.

10:39.136 --> 10:40.763
Hey... Baby.

10:40.804 --> 10:42.738
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

10:42.773 --> 10:44.104
- 4.
- Yeah.

10:44.141 --> 10:45.472
Uh, gate one.

10:45.509 --> 10:46.771
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

10:46.810 --> 10:47.936
Wait... No. No, please.

10:47.978 --> 10:50.378
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

10:50.414 --> 10:52.575
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

10:52.616 --> 10:55.141
OK. Take it easy.

10:55.185 --> 10:58.245
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

10:58.288 --> 11:01.280
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

11:01.324 --> 11:04.350
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

11:04.394 --> 11:05.588
I'm sitting in the front.

11:06.596 --> 11:08.086
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

11:08.131 --> 11:08.426
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

11:08.431 --> 11:09.557
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

11:09.598 --> 11:11.566
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.261
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

11:13.468 --> 11:14.332
Heads.

11:15.336 --> 11:17.930
Shit! Damn it.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.374
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

11:21.409 --> 11:23.206
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

11:23.244 --> 11:25.769
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

11:25.814 --> 11:27.611
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

11:27.649 --> 11:28.775
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

11:28.817 --> 11:30.751
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

11:35.657 --> 11:36.715
Ha ha ha!

11:41.529 --> 11:44.293
Aaah!

11:54.776 --> 11:56.744
Ohh!

12:05.353 --> 12:06.843
Here we go. Hey!

12:06.888 --> 12:09.049
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.388
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

12:11.426 --> 12:13.223
You know, she might need
some comforting...

12:13.261 --> 12:14.853
and I'll be there for her. OK?

12:14.896 --> 12:17.160
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

12:17.198 --> 12:18.597
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.328
No. Get...

12:20.368 --> 12:22.393
Let's just get in the back, OK?

12:24.105 --> 12:25.595
Ha ha ha!

12:25.640 --> 12:27.733
Ahem.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.776
Guess who's back?

12:31.813 --> 12:33.371
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

12:33.414 --> 12:35.814
Hey!

12:35.850 --> 12:37.818
I'll meet you at the end.

12:39.721 --> 12:41.188
Here! All right!

12:41.222 --> 12:42.382
Cool!

12:43.591 --> 12:45.889
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

12:45.927 --> 12:47.656
What? I'm 55 inches.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.162
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

12:49.197 --> 12:50.494
You, too. Out.

12:50.532 --> 12:51.726
- Ready?
- Ohh!

12:51.766 --> 12:54.166
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

12:54.202 --> 12:55.226
You OK?

12:55.270 --> 12:56.794
Let's go on the bumper cars.

12:56.838 --> 12:58.772
Come on. Here we go.

13:02.143 --> 13:03.405
Yeah!

13:08.249 --> 13:09.307
What's up, man? I'm good.

13:13.021 --> 13:15.649
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

13:15.690 --> 13:16.918
when we go through the loop.

13:22.196 --> 13:24.221
All right. Ha ha!

13:29.003 --> 13:31.699
Yo! What, you can't read?

13:34.475 --> 13:36.943
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

13:36.978 --> 13:38.002
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

13:38.046 --> 13:40.037
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

13:48.690 --> 13:50.248
Oh!

13:50.291 --> 13:52.122
Aw, shit!

13:55.597 --> 13:56.689
Here you go!

14:06.274 --> 14:07.366
Whoo-ooh!

14:07.408 --> 14:10.935
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

14:10.979 --> 14:12.776
Come on!

14:12.814 --> 14:14.611
Come on. Get hyped.

14:14.649 --> 14:15.946
The first hill's so high.

14:15.984 --> 14:17.417
Yeah.

14:17.452 --> 14:20.319
This is what we need!

14:20.355 --> 14:23.188
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:23.224 --> 14:24.452
Whoo!

14:24.492 --> 14:26.960
Whoo-hoo!

14:26.995 --> 14:29.088
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

14:29.130 --> 14:30.119
Ow!

14:32.500 --> 14:33.967
Whoo!

14:35.369 --> 14:37.030
Aw, yeah!

15:00.227 --> 15:01.626
Whoo!

15:07.835 --> 15:09.530
Whoo! Shit!

15:17.211 --> 15:18.803
Aah!

15:18.846 --> 15:20.643
Oh, man.

15:20.681 --> 15:22.615
Oh, my God!

15:22.650 --> 15:23.639
Here we go!

15:23.684 --> 15:25.379
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:25.419 --> 15:26.681
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:26.720 --> 15:28.085
Aah!

15:28.122 --> 15:30.147
Yeah! Whoo!

15:35.529 --> 15:38.726
Aah!

15:40.201 --> 15:42.863
- Aah!
- Aah!

15:44.572 --> 15:46.563
Ha ha!

15:49.343 --> 15:50.901
Aah! Aah! Ha ha ha!

15:51.912 --> 15:52.901
Whoo!

15:54.014 --> 15:55.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:55.983 --> 15:58.383
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

15:58.419 --> 16:00.683
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

16:04.191 --> 16:06.159
Aah! Aah!

16:11.899 --> 16:14.766
Whoo!

16:19.273 --> 16:22.037
Yeah! Show me your titties!

16:22.076 --> 16:23.202
- Fuck off, Frankie!
- Oh!

16:32.553 --> 16:33.850
Aah!

16:33.888 --> 16:36.220
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

16:37.825 --> 16:39.725
Aah!

16:42.997 --> 16:44.294
Unh!

16:46.634 --> 16:48.067
Oh, shit!

16:48.102 --> 16:49.729
- Aah!
- Aah!

16:49.770 --> 16:51.101
Aah!

16:52.173 --> 16:55.540
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

16:55.576 --> 16:57.066
Aah!

17:00.381 --> 17:01.814
No!

17:12.126 --> 17:13.820
- Aah!
- Aaah!

17:17.531 --> 17:18.998
Aah!

17:20.800 --> 17:21.893
Aah!

17:23.470 --> 17:24.732
Oh! Oh!

17:30.177 --> 17:31.872
Aah!

17:34.515 --> 17:35.812
Unh!

17:36.817 --> 17:38.808
Oh!

17:38.852 --> 17:40.319
- Yow!
- Kevin!

17:41.322 --> 17:42.482
No!

17:42.523 --> 17:43.888
Aah!

17:51.065 --> 17:52.225
Whoa!

17:53.567 --> 17:54.556
Aah!

17:55.936 --> 17:58.268
No! Aah!

18:09.550 --> 18:10.847
Aah!

18:10.884 --> 18:12.715
Erin, hang on!

18:12.753 --> 18:15.119
Erin!

18:15.155 --> 18:16.645
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

18:16.690 --> 18:17.657
I can't.

18:17.691 --> 18:19.784
Aah!

18:19.827 --> 18:21.454
Aah!

18:21.495 --> 18:22.985
No!

18:24.164 --> 18:25.153
Aah!

18:25.199 --> 18:26.962
Oh, God!

18:27.001 --> 18:28.559
Hang on, Wen.

18:28.602 --> 18:31.503
Hang on! Help me rock it!

18:36.577 --> 18:38.135
Unh! Unh! Unh!

18:40.014 --> 18:41.743
Unh!

18:42.916 --> 18:45.407
Almost got it! Gently.

18:55.296 --> 18:57.093
Aaaah!

19:00.301 --> 19:01.734
No!

19:01.769 --> 19:04.363
Unh! Aah!

19:04.405 --> 19:07.374
Aah!

19:10.044 --> 19:11.739
Yo. What, you can't read?

19:11.779 --> 19:13.440
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

19:13.481 --> 19:14.573
Yeah.

19:14.615 --> 19:16.139
Thanks, bro.

19:16.184 --> 19:17.515
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

19:17.552 --> 19:19.417
What're you...?

19:19.454 --> 19:21.046
Here you go!

19:21.088 --> 19:23.318
Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!

19:23.357 --> 19:25.382
We have to get off of here.

19:25.426 --> 19:27.894
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

19:27.929 --> 19:30.591
Unh! Let me off! Let me off!

19:30.631 --> 19:31.962
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

19:31.999 --> 19:33.728
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

19:33.768 --> 19:34.757
Wendy?

19:34.802 --> 19:38.397
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

19:38.439 --> 19:39.906
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

19:39.941 --> 19:41.238
Chick's on somethin'.

19:41.275 --> 19:42.333
It's all right! You'll be OK!

19:42.376 --> 19:43.400
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

19:43.444 --> 19:44.706
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

19:46.747 --> 19:47.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:47.982 --> 19:50.177
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

19:50.218 --> 19:52.618
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

19:52.653 --> 19:55.019
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

19:55.056 --> 19:56.819
No, she was just a little upset before.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.883
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

19:58.926 --> 20:02.259
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

20:02.296 --> 20:04.287
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

20:04.332 --> 20:06.061
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.567
<i>- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?</i>

20:07.602 --> 20:08.967
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

20:09.003 --> 20:09.970
Ow!

20:10.004 --> 20:10.993
Hey, hey!

20:11.038 --> 20:12.232
Unh!

20:12.273 --> 20:13.240
Just relax!

20:13.274 --> 20:14.571
Fight, man!

20:14.609 --> 20:15.667
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.302
Nobody else gets off this ride!

20:17.345 --> 20:19.279
Dude, let me off.

20:19.313 --> 20:20.610
So high school.

20:20.648 --> 20:21.774
Let's out.

20:21.816 --> 20:22.840
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

20:22.884 --> 20:23.908
- Relax!
- lan!

20:23.951 --> 20:26.784
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

20:26.821 --> 20:30.416
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

20:30.458 --> 20:32.756
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

20:32.793 --> 20:35.023
- Relax! Calm down!
- # Hey! Ho! Let's go #

20:35.062 --> 20:36.689
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

20:36.731 --> 20:39.131
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

20:39.166 --> 20:40.428
Dude!

20:40.468 --> 20:43.335
# Hey, ho, let's go,
hey, ho, let's go #

20:43.371 --> 20:45.100
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

20:45.139 --> 20:46.504
# Hey, ho #

20:49.176 --> 20:50.575
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

20:50.611 --> 20:51.600
Oh, my God!

20:51.646 --> 20:53.045
Whoo!

20:53.080 --> 20:55.048
Stop it! No! Stop it!

20:56.183 --> 20:59.050
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

20:59.086 --> 21:02.055
Stop! Stop! Please!

21:02.089 --> 21:03.613
Jason!

21:03.658 --> 21:05.592
Hey, just relax, OK?

21:05.626 --> 21:07.958
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

21:07.995 --> 21:09.121
OK? Just let her settle down.

21:09.163 --> 21:10.630
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

21:10.665 --> 21:12.257
what is your home phone number?

21:12.300 --> 21:15.269
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

21:15.303 --> 21:17.294
Aah!

21:18.606 --> 21:23.509
Oh, my God! Jason!

22:17.797 --> 22:19.492
Ohh.

22:57.971 --> 22:59.700
Hey, Wendy!

22:59.739 --> 23:01.468
Hey!

23:01.508 --> 23:04.204
Wait! Wendy!

23:04.244 --> 23:05.836
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

23:05.879 --> 23:07.574
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.411
Just here to pick up my diploma.

23:09.449 --> 23:10.711
You're not going to graduation?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.047
No.

23:12.085 --> 23:15.816
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

23:15.855 --> 23:18.517
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

23:18.558 --> 23:20.583
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

23:20.627 --> 23:21.616
At graduation?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.390
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

23:23.429 --> 23:24.828
Then do it for J and Carrie.

23:24.864 --> 23:26.695
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

23:26.733 --> 23:29.065
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

23:29.102 --> 23:30.364
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

23:30.403 --> 23:32.871
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

23:32.906 --> 23:35.374
I am alive, and I don't care.

23:35.408 --> 23:36.705
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

23:36.743 --> 23:39.041
I am so out of McKinley.

23:39.078 --> 23:40.443
Without J, what's here for me?

23:40.480 --> 23:42.471
I'm here. OK?

23:42.515 --> 23:45.951
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

23:45.985 --> 23:48.818
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

23:48.855 --> 23:50.880
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

23:50.924 --> 23:52.949
Kevin...

23:52.992 --> 23:54.619
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

23:54.661 --> 23:56.356
and me and Carrie being friends...

23:56.396 --> 23:59.058
we wouldn't have even hung out.

24:01.234 --> 24:03.930
We don't even like each other.

24:12.612 --> 24:15.012
"lan McKinley."

24:15.048 --> 24:17.482
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

24:17.517 --> 24:19.212
is the same as my high school?

24:19.252 --> 24:22.085
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

24:22.121 --> 24:24.817
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

24:32.765 --> 24:34.733
I think we should invite her.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.257
- You think?
- Yeah.

24:40.373 --> 24:42.238
Wen? Um...

24:42.275 --> 24:44.835
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

24:44.878 --> 24:47.278
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

24:47.313 --> 24:49.747
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

24:49.782 --> 24:50.908
Totally.

24:50.950 --> 24:53.009
And just like, talk if you want.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.586
Here's my cell.

24:56.623 --> 24:58.887
I already have your number.

25:01.094 --> 25:03.153
That was so nice of us.

25:13.039 --> 25:14.506
You're not alone.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.371
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

25:16.409 --> 25:17.637
OK? I really do.

25:17.677 --> 25:19.406
No, it's happened before.

25:19.445 --> 25:22.471
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

25:22.515 --> 25:24.779
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

25:24.817 --> 25:27.843
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

25:27.887 --> 25:29.320
about what happened,
and I found out...

25:29.355 --> 25:31.880
about this high school
French class from New York.

25:31.925 --> 25:34.917
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

25:34.961 --> 25:36.258
When they were boarding...

25:36.296 --> 25:38.730
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

25:38.765 --> 25:41.825
Just like you did.

25:41.868 --> 25:43.426
He freaked out...

25:43.469 --> 25:45.869
and seven people
got off the plane.

25:48.374 --> 25:49.773
Just like us.

25:51.811 --> 25:55.508
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

25:55.548 --> 25:57.880
And over the next several months...

25:57.917 --> 26:02.081
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

26:02.121 --> 26:05.579
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

26:05.625 --> 26:09.026
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

26:09.062 --> 26:11.622
Fuck you, Kevin.

26:11.664 --> 26:14.565
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

26:38.524 --> 26:41.391
Ohh, every time we come here.

26:41.427 --> 26:44.658
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

26:44.697 --> 26:47.427
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

26:47.467 --> 26:48.900
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

26:48.935 --> 26:50.493
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

26:50.536 --> 26:52.401
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

26:52.438 --> 26:54.838
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.136
Yeah.

26:56.175 --> 26:58.200
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

26:58.244 --> 27:00.178
who will never get a graduation.

27:01.981 --> 27:03.471
You know what?
You're totally right.

27:03.516 --> 27:05.814
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

27:29.175 --> 27:31.735
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

27:31.778 --> 27:34.008
that Grandma left me in her will.

27:35.348 --> 27:36.337
Ohh!

27:36.382 --> 27:38.441
Julie?

27:40.286 --> 27:42.151
I need...

27:45.391 --> 27:47.222
I could use some help.

27:48.828 --> 27:52.958
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

27:52.999 --> 27:56.025
I should never have let
that ride go.

27:56.069 --> 27:59.561
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

27:59.605 --> 28:01.072
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

28:01.107 --> 28:04.599
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

28:05.611 --> 28:08.409
And I would give anything...

28:08.448 --> 28:10.575
to have a second chance.

28:13.386 --> 28:15.047
But I never can.

28:19.692 --> 28:22.456
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

28:22.495 --> 28:25.794
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.734
You're all I have left.

28:31.838 --> 28:33.237
You think when I find a place...

28:33.272 --> 28:35.502
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

28:37.677 --> 28:39.804
You know I will.

28:41.848 --> 28:43.509
You...

28:45.551 --> 28:47.041
keep this now...

28:47.086 --> 28:49.577
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

28:51.257 --> 28:54.590
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

28:54.627 --> 28:57.790
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

28:57.830 --> 29:00.663
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.190
Done.

29:03.236 --> 29:04.362
Oh. Um...

29:04.403 --> 29:05.836
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

29:05.872 --> 29:09.171
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.766
Cool.

29:26.058 --> 29:27.150
In a hurry, Yuri.

29:27.193 --> 29:29.184
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.196
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.697
I must go outside.

29:32.732 --> 29:35.496
Why don't you just use that phone?

29:35.535 --> 29:38.504
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

29:40.273 --> 29:41.672
Shit. That's her.

29:41.707 --> 29:43.641
Ohh!

29:43.676 --> 29:44.768
You know what? Just go outside.

29:44.810 --> 29:46.141
We can deal with this ourselves.

29:46.179 --> 29:47.703
OK.

29:49.615 --> 29:53.711
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

29:53.753 --> 29:54.777
Good.

30:06.866 --> 30:07.992
What are you doing?

30:08.034 --> 30:10.525
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

31:48.034 --> 31:50.059
Oh, my God.

32:00.279 --> 32:02.679
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

32:02.715 --> 32:04.512
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.677
Mmm!

32:06.719 --> 32:09.244
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

32:11.223 --> 32:13.453
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

32:13.859 --> 32:16.350
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.453
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

32:43.788 --> 32:45.779
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

32:45.824 --> 32:47.815
Sucks, bitch.

32:47.859 --> 32:50.020
They got CDs.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.456
Ew. Celine?

32:55.500 --> 32:56.899
Britney?

32:56.935 --> 32:59.130
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

32:59.170 --> 33:02.071
Uh, yeah.

33:02.107 --> 33:04.837
Ugh. Whatever.

33:19.024 --> 33:22.187
Why are you wearing underwear?

33:22.227 --> 33:24.457
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

33:24.496 --> 33:26.987
All right.

34:10.909 --> 34:12.433
# Roller coaster #

34:12.476 --> 34:13.774
# Of love #

34:13.812 --> 34:15.143
# Say what? #

34:15.179 --> 34:17.306
# Roller coaster #

34:17.349 --> 34:19.317
# Ooh ooh ooh #

34:19.351 --> 34:20.545
# Roller coaster #

34:20.585 --> 34:21.574
# Right #

34:21.620 --> 34:23.212
# Of love #

34:23.455 --> 34:25.786
# Roller coaster #

34:25.824 --> 34:27.917
# Ooh ooh ooh #

34:27.958 --> 34:31.759
# Roller coaster of love #

34:31.795 --> 34:33.491
# Roller coaster #

34:33.531 --> 34:34.998
# Wow wow wow #

34:35.033 --> 34:36.193
# Ooh ooh ooh #

34:36.234 --> 34:39.670
# Roller coaster of love... #

35:00.925 --> 35:02.893
# I #

35:03.895 --> 35:04.862
# Huh, huh #

35:08.733 --> 35:10.564
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

35:10.602 --> 35:12.069
# Yeah #

35:12.103 --> 35:13.661
# Whoo-hoo-hoo #

35:13.705 --> 35:15.297
# Wow, yeah #

35:15.340 --> 35:16.432
# Huh huh #

35:17.942 --> 35:19.068
# Ow #

35:19.110 --> 35:20.907
# Oh, oh #

35:25.483 --> 35:27.178
Whoo.

35:27.218 --> 35:30.244
# Roller coaster of love #

35:30.288 --> 35:31.516
# Love roller coaster, girl #

35:31.556 --> 35:33.319
# Roller coaster #

35:33.358 --> 35:36.225
# Lovin' you
in a freaky world, child #

35:36.261 --> 35:39.230
# Roller coaster of love #

35:46.538 --> 35:48.904
Camera charged?

35:48.940 --> 35:51.841
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

35:51.876 --> 35:53.707
Camera's not working. Sorry.

35:56.981 --> 36:00.178
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

36:00.218 --> 36:02.209
Like private.

36:06.825 --> 36:09.726
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

36:09.761 --> 36:12.025
# One more time #

36:12.063 --> 36:15.499
# Roller coaster of love #

36:16.568 --> 36:18.331
# Roller coaster #

36:19.404 --> 36:23.932
# Roller coaster of love #

36:26.611 --> 36:28.602
Ugh.

36:28.646 --> 36:31.114
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

36:36.354 --> 36:39.323
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

36:39.357 --> 36:40.881
Huh?

36:54.372 --> 36:55.771
Ow! Aah!

36:58.543 --> 36:59.669
Hello?

36:59.711 --> 37:02.703
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

37:04.149 --> 37:05.446
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

37:05.483 --> 37:06.507
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

37:06.551 --> 37:07.518
Aah!

37:07.552 --> 37:09.417
And thanks again for the invite.

37:09.454 --> 37:11.513
- Someone help!
- Aah!

37:13.491 --> 37:15.459
Sorry I was too late.

37:21.065 --> 37:23.226
Aah!

37:23.268 --> 37:24.860
Aah! Aah!

37:24.903 --> 37:27.394
Aah! Aah! Aah!

37:30.408 --> 37:32.706
Aah! Aah! Aah!

37:35.046 --> 37:36.809
Aah! Aah!

37:36.848 --> 37:38.713
Oh! Oh!

37:38.750 --> 37:40.217
Oh! Aah!

37:41.352 --> 37:42.319
Aaah! Aaah!

37:46.357 --> 37:47.483
Hey, open the door!

37:56.201 --> 37:58.465
Help me!

38:00.905 --> 38:03.567
Aah!

38:03.608 --> 38:09.877
Aah!

38:09.914 --> 38:12.906
Aah!

38:14.586 --> 38:18.955
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

38:18.990 --> 38:22.983
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

38:23.027 --> 38:26.394
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

38:26.431 --> 38:31.027
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

38:31.069 --> 38:34.470
which we have
suffered much of late...

38:34.505 --> 38:39.408
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

38:39.444 --> 38:44.074
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.811
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

38:46.818 --> 38:48.809
All of us?
How can you say that?

38:48.853 --> 38:50.081
Shut up, McKinley.

38:50.121 --> 38:52.783
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

38:52.824 --> 38:54.849
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

38:54.892 --> 38:57.588
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

38:57.628 --> 39:00.324
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

39:00.364 --> 39:01.626
they're alive and well.

39:01.666 --> 39:05.727
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

39:05.770 --> 39:07.965
- Shh!
- they don't get to make it to 18?

39:08.005 --> 39:09.632
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

39:10.975 --> 39:11.942
- What?
- Come on, man.

39:11.976 --> 39:13.637
I can... Yeah. Fine.

39:13.678 --> 39:15.305
Fine. All right. All right.

39:15.346 --> 39:17.109
I'm fine. All right.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.911
That's crazy.

39:20.384 --> 39:23.683
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

39:23.721 --> 39:26.884
please step forward at this time.

39:33.531 --> 39:36.591
I so feel this is so my fault.

39:36.634 --> 39:39.102
How could it possibly be your fault?

39:39.136 --> 39:42.230
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

39:42.273 --> 39:46.266
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

39:46.310 --> 39:49.108
whatever... humanity...

39:49.146 --> 39:52.206
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

39:52.250 --> 39:56.653
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

39:56.687 --> 40:00.054
Stretch. Tan.

40:01.092 --> 40:02.684
Don't be down, Frankie.

40:02.727 --> 40:04.490
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

40:04.528 --> 40:06.792
that happens somehow
a story about you.

40:11.602 --> 40:12.933
God!

40:23.147 --> 40:25.741
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

40:25.783 --> 40:28.013
Fucking boring.

40:28.052 --> 40:30.885
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

40:30.922 --> 40:32.651
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

40:32.690 --> 40:34.351
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

40:38.195 --> 40:41.164
Whew.

40:42.700 --> 40:43.894
Hello?

40:43.935 --> 40:45.493
I'm with J.

41:11.929 --> 41:14.796
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

41:16.300 --> 41:18.234
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

41:18.269 --> 41:21.500
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

41:21.539 --> 41:25.703
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

41:27.211 --> 41:29.679
spirit or presence or...

41:29.714 --> 41:31.705
whatever.

41:31.749 --> 41:34.547
But now that I'm here...

41:34.585 --> 41:38.180
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

41:39.857 --> 41:41.825
it's a cemetery.

41:43.728 --> 41:46.697
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

41:47.732 --> 41:49.461
And I've tried.

41:50.501 --> 41:52.435
Real hard. Heh.

41:55.172 --> 41:58.232
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

42:00.244 --> 42:04.374
that night...
before I got on the ride...

42:04.415 --> 42:06.315
Jason said...

42:06.350 --> 42:07.942
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

42:07.985 --> 42:09.782
he said...

42:09.820 --> 42:14.382
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

42:14.425 --> 42:17.121
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

42:17.161 --> 42:21.097
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

42:21.132 --> 42:25.728
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

42:25.770 --> 42:28.330
It's like a presence.

42:28.372 --> 42:32.274
Like a living thing
always with me.

42:33.911 --> 42:35.435
You think it's J?

42:35.479 --> 42:37.003
No, I know it's not.

42:37.048 --> 42:41.917
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

42:41.952 --> 42:46.252
It's cold and terrifying.

43:21.992 --> 43:24.552
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

43:24.595 --> 43:26.085
The photographic plate
was broken...

43:26.130 --> 43:28.496
causing a line
that can't be removed.

43:28.532 --> 43:30.363
Exactly where he was shot.

43:32.536 --> 43:34.401
Look. See the shadow?

43:36.006 --> 43:38.634
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

43:38.676 --> 43:42.043
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

43:42.079 --> 43:44.138
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

43:44.181 --> 43:46.206
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

43:46.250 --> 43:48.548
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

43:48.586 --> 43:49.814
with the Flight 180 thing.

43:49.854 --> 43:51.879
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

43:51.922 --> 43:53.685
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

43:53.724 --> 43:54.850
because you're desperate
for an answer.

43:54.892 --> 43:56.792
I took these.

43:56.827 --> 43:58.795
That night.

44:05.703 --> 44:07.534
These?

44:11.242 --> 44:12.368
Are these it?

44:17.381 --> 44:19.906
Oh, shit.

44:21.485 --> 44:23.385
Oh... shit.

44:24.989 --> 44:26.513
Ohh.

44:28.526 --> 44:30.619
Whoa, whoa, hey.
You all right?

44:30.661 --> 44:32.288
I'm feeling a little woozy.

44:33.964 --> 44:35.898
When was the last time you ate?

44:37.134 --> 44:38.726
I don't remember.

44:39.904 --> 44:41.599
All right, come on. I'll drive.

44:45.976 --> 44:49.673
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

44:49.713 --> 44:52.045
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

44:52.082 --> 44:54.710
OK?
So if this is that, then...

44:55.920 --> 44:58.047
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

44:59.323 --> 45:00.620
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

45:00.658 --> 45:02.683
I felt this instinct.

45:02.726 --> 45:04.455
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

45:04.495 --> 45:06.963
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

45:06.997 --> 45:08.225
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

45:08.265 --> 45:09.289
It's right here.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.665
- You got it?
- Yeah.

45:14.672 --> 45:16.162
- Wait! Watch out!
- Oh!

45:16.207 --> 45:18.266
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

45:18.309 --> 45:20.334
Sorry!

45:22.813 --> 45:24.644
All right,
let's just eat over there.

45:24.682 --> 45:25.910
And go through
the drive through.

45:25.950 --> 45:27.144
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

45:27.184 --> 45:28.879
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

45:28.919 --> 45:30.284
any less of a control freak.

45:38.762 --> 45:40.389
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

45:40.431 --> 45:41.455
Here's Frank's picture.

45:41.498 --> 45:43.022
All right.

45:43.067 --> 45:45.433
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

45:45.469 --> 45:48.370
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

45:49.373 --> 45:52.069
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

45:52.109 --> 45:53.337
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

45:53.377 --> 45:56.073
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

45:57.147 --> 45:59.445
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

46:00.884 --> 46:03.409
It's so sad that you know that.

46:03.454 --> 46:05.479
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

46:05.522 --> 46:07.080
on this game, though, so...

46:07.124 --> 46:09.092
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

46:09.126 --> 46:10.388
Yeah. Yeah.

46:10.427 --> 46:12.292
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

46:14.365 --> 46:16.560
All right! God.

46:19.703 --> 46:21.034
All right.

46:24.775 --> 46:25.935
Uh, can I take your order?

46:25.976 --> 46:27.807
Yeah. What do you want?

46:32.883 --> 46:34.316
Are you OK?

46:42.459 --> 46:45.087
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

46:47.531 --> 46:50.466
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

46:50.501 --> 46:52.594
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

46:52.636 --> 46:54.228
Hey!

46:58.409 --> 47:00.070
# There is someone #

47:00.110 --> 47:01.600
Stop! Stop!

47:01.645 --> 47:02.634
# Walking behind you #

47:03.647 --> 47:05.308
Watch out! Shit!

47:05.349 --> 47:06.475
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

47:06.517 --> 47:08.610
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

47:08.652 --> 47:10.711
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

47:10.754 --> 47:12.415
Behind us!

47:12.456 --> 47:13.821
There's no one in that truck!

47:13.591 --> 47:14.148
# Watching your footsteps #

47:13.857 --> 47:15.085
# Watching your footsteps #

47:14.858 --> 47:17.952
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

47:18.995 --> 47:22.624
- # Look at me #
- Unh! Shit!

47:22.666 --> 47:23.633
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

47:23.667 --> 47:24.691
Back up!

47:25.735 --> 47:27.726
# Who really loves you #

47:29.239 --> 47:31.434
# Here's my heart #

47:31.474 --> 47:32.634
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

47:32.676 --> 47:34.871
# In my hand #

47:34.911 --> 47:38.642
# Turn around #

47:38.682 --> 47:40.013
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

47:40.050 --> 47:41.347
Come on, come on, come on.

47:47.190 --> 47:48.555
Unh!

48:26.162 --> 48:27.527
- Oh!
- Unh!

48:35.672 --> 48:39.039
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

48:39.075 --> 48:41.543
Um, we can walk to my house...

48:41.578 --> 48:43.944
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

48:45.315 --> 48:46.577
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

48:51.588 --> 48:52.646
Will we?

48:55.091 --> 48:56.524
Yeah. We'll be all right.

48:56.559 --> 48:59.084
I mean...

48:59.129 --> 49:01.222
how Frank...

49:01.264 --> 49:03.061
God, it... it's not only horrible...

49:03.099 --> 49:06.330
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

49:06.369 --> 49:07.734
Easy.

49:07.771 --> 49:09.705
OK? Easy.

49:11.407 --> 49:12.999
Let's just...

49:13.042 --> 49:14.873
let's just take a step back.

49:16.279 --> 49:18.543
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

49:18.581 --> 49:20.674
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

49:20.717 --> 49:23.242
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

49:23.286 --> 49:25.049
We were wrong about the photos.

49:25.088 --> 49:27.955
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

49:27.991 --> 49:30.983
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

49:31.027 --> 49:33.086
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

49:34.097 --> 49:37.897
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

49:39.602 --> 49:41.797
No. l... you know, I'm not...

49:41.838 --> 49:44.204
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

49:45.408 --> 49:47.740
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

49:47.777 --> 49:49.836
then lan and Erin.

49:49.879 --> 49:52.006
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

49:52.048 --> 49:54.107
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

49:54.150 --> 49:55.139
No.

49:55.185 --> 49:57.050
All right, you know what?

49:57.086 --> 49:59.520
We'll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin
if they remember.

49:59.556 --> 50:01.114
OK?

50:01.157 --> 50:03.682
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

50:16.973 --> 50:19.703
I guess...

50:19.742 --> 50:21.300
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

50:21.344 --> 50:22.538
for the rest of our lives.

50:22.579 --> 50:24.171
Yeah.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.946
You know, I was gonna...

50:27.984 --> 50:30.145
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

50:31.721 --> 50:33.689
Right after graduation.

50:33.723 --> 50:35.520
Heh.

50:47.604 --> 50:49.071
Oh.

50:55.144 --> 50:57.112
No, wait.

50:57.146 --> 50:58.579
Look, behind Stacy.

50:59.582 --> 51:00.776
That's Frank.

51:01.918 --> 51:03.510
This picture shows how he died.

51:08.558 --> 51:08.922
All right, go back to Lewis.

51:08.925 --> 51:10.916
All right, go back to Lewis.

51:12.929 --> 51:14.362
OK, he's got that hammer.

51:14.397 --> 51:17.264
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

51:17.300 --> 51:19.097
on his head.

51:19.135 --> 51:20.124
No, no, no, check this out.

51:20.169 --> 51:23.263
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

51:23.306 --> 51:25.706
State's team is called the Sultans.

51:25.741 --> 51:27.368
That's it. That's the clue.

51:27.410 --> 51:30.379
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

51:34.650 --> 51:35.674
Wouldn't you want to know?

51:37.253 --> 51:38.618
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

51:38.654 --> 51:40.349
Yeah.

51:40.389 --> 51:41.651
Yeah, of course.

51:41.691 --> 51:43.682
Huh. No.

51:43.726 --> 51:46.490
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

51:46.529 --> 51:47.826
What about willful ignorance?

51:47.863 --> 51:50.525
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

51:50.566 --> 51:52.261
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

51:52.301 --> 51:53.563
before it happened, Wendy.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.898
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

51:56.939 --> 51:59.908
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

51:59.942 --> 52:01.534
I gotta stay focused...

52:01.577 --> 52:03.135
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

52:03.179 --> 52:05.739
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

52:07.850 --> 52:10.011
I mean, unless we have to.

52:11.020 --> 52:13.750
You mean until we have to.

52:19.728 --> 52:21.355
One more thing.

52:21.397 --> 52:23.365
Is it bad?

52:23.399 --> 52:26.664
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

52:26.936 --> 52:29.200
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

52:29.238 --> 52:30.830
I'll see you tomorrow.

52:35.744 --> 52:37.371
You on crack. Both of you.

52:37.413 --> 52:39.745
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

52:39.782 --> 52:41.409
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

52:41.450 --> 52:42.974
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

52:43.018 --> 52:44.508
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

52:44.553 --> 52:46.680
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

52:46.722 --> 52:48.986
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

52:49.024 --> 52:51.322
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.418
Just listen, Lewis.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.827
Kevin, it's like those stories.

52:54.863 --> 52:58.697
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

52:58.734 --> 53:02.033
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

53:02.071 --> 53:04.198
You know, shit like that, man.

53:04.239 --> 53:05.706
Fuck the Bruins!

53:05.741 --> 53:07.971
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

53:08.010 --> 53:09.773
Bruin faggots!

53:09.812 --> 53:11.404
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

53:14.416 --> 53:17.749
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

53:17.786 --> 53:19.754
Three people have died, Lewis.

53:19.788 --> 53:21.119
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

53:21.156 --> 53:23.124
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

53:23.158 --> 53:24.989
you're in serious denial.

53:25.027 --> 53:26.517
Unh! What about you two, huh?

53:26.562 --> 53:27.824
What?

53:27.863 --> 53:30.991
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

53:31.033 --> 53:32.967
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

53:33.002 --> 53:34.731
seeing signs and patterns, man.

53:34.770 --> 53:38.536
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

53:38.574 --> 53:41.065
Unh! It's wrong.

53:42.544 --> 53:44.307
That's denial.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.177
Unh!

53:47.182 --> 53:49.548
- Unh!
- You got it!

53:49.585 --> 53:51.849
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

53:51.887 --> 53:52.876
Wendy saw it.

53:52.921 --> 53:55.788
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

53:55.824 --> 53:58.258
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

53:58.293 --> 54:00.284
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

54:00.329 --> 54:01.921
Hers came to her from nowhere.

54:01.964 --> 54:03.693
You're here and alive because of her.

54:03.732 --> 54:05.222
No, I'm alive because of me.

54:05.267 --> 54:06.791
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

54:06.835 --> 54:08.200
Does that make sense to you?

54:08.237 --> 54:10.034
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

54:10.072 --> 54:11.835
No, just hear me out, all right?

54:11.874 --> 54:12.898
Unh.

54:12.941 --> 54:14.306
# Yeah #

54:19.515 --> 54:22.541
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

54:22.584 --> 54:24.984
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

54:25.020 --> 54:26.248
It's going just as I saw it.

54:26.288 --> 54:29.519
35 high school games
without an injury.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.890
<i>- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.</i>

54:31.927 --> 54:33.895
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

54:33.929 --> 54:35.453
Man, fuck the Bruins!

54:35.497 --> 54:36.987
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

54:37.032 --> 54:39.091
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

54:39.134 --> 54:40.726
Aah!

54:40.769 --> 54:43.101
Unh! Unh! Unh!

54:43.138 --> 54:44.730
Four years from now...

54:44.773 --> 54:47.298
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

54:47.342 --> 54:49.003
Unh!

54:49.044 --> 54:51.171
He's gonna romp and stomp.

54:51.213 --> 54:55.206
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.377
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

54:57.419 --> 54:59.819
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

54:59.855 --> 55:01.550
Death wear blue and orange.

55:01.590 --> 55:04.388
Real men wear black.

55:04.426 --> 55:05.586
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

55:05.627 --> 55:07.925
Death is afraid of me!

55:07.963 --> 55:09.430
Death fears me!

55:09.465 --> 55:10.693
Kevin.

55:10.732 --> 55:12.825
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

55:12.868 --> 55:16.770
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

55:16.805 --> 55:18.102
Fuck Death!

55:18.140 --> 55:20.074
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

55:20.109 --> 55:22.009
Aah!

55:22.044 --> 55:23.477
- Look out!
- Lewis!

55:25.614 --> 55:27.081
Man, that was close, Lewis.

55:27.116 --> 55:29.107
Hey, did you see that?

55:29.151 --> 55:32.609
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

55:32.654 --> 55:34.588
Fuck Death! I just win!

55:34.623 --> 55:36.022
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

55:36.058 --> 55:37.150
Baby, I just win!

55:38.293 --> 55:39.385
Aaaaah!

55:39.428 --> 55:41.726
- Ooooh!
- God!

55:51.473 --> 55:53.941
Did I do something...

55:56.110 --> 55:57.805
to bring this on everybody?

55:57.845 --> 55:59.938
Don't, Wendy.

55:59.981 --> 56:02.973
But why me?

56:03.017 --> 56:05.281
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

56:05.319 --> 56:08.152
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

56:11.258 --> 56:14.022
I just want it to stop.

56:14.061 --> 56:15.892
Just stop.

56:15.930 --> 56:18.626
I don't know why, Wendy...

56:18.666 --> 56:21.226
but you didn't do anything.

56:22.370 --> 56:24.895
All right? This is just...

56:24.939 --> 56:26.839
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

56:26.874 --> 56:29.604
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

56:29.643 --> 56:31.838
to make you feel OK, but...

56:34.315 --> 56:36.715
You know, I can't.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.419
Yeah.

56:41.422 --> 56:43.083
There's nothing I can do.

56:47.461 --> 56:48.894
Can you drive?

56:49.897 --> 56:51.489
Heh.

56:51.532 --> 56:52.794
Yeah.

56:57.605 --> 56:59.197
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

56:59.240 --> 57:03.540
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

57:03.577 --> 57:05.943
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

57:05.980 --> 57:07.811
lmpaled by a gear shift?

57:11.152 --> 57:12.312
Right?

57:26.067 --> 57:27.762
Zip, it's Pip.

57:27.802 --> 57:29.235
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

57:29.270 --> 57:30.760
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

57:30.805 --> 57:34.172
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

57:34.208 --> 57:35.800
They keep settin' off the alarms.

57:48.922 --> 57:50.947
Hello, babies.

57:59.397 --> 58:01.627
Ha ha ha!

58:01.666 --> 58:05.568
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

58:09.407 --> 58:12.706
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

58:12.744 --> 58:14.735
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

58:14.779 --> 58:16.679
to return to the shelves
themselves...

58:16.714 --> 58:18.113
we can blow out of here, OK?

58:18.149 --> 58:19.776
Righty-o, babe.

58:24.088 --> 58:25.248
Aah!

58:25.290 --> 58:27.019
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

58:27.058 --> 58:28.650
Shit!

58:28.693 --> 58:30.593
You scared the shit out of me!

58:30.628 --> 58:32.823
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

58:41.406 --> 58:44.341
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

58:44.375 --> 58:47.105
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

58:47.145 --> 58:50.342
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

58:50.381 --> 58:53.817
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. on nail polish...

58:53.852 --> 58:56.821
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

58:56.855 --> 58:58.482
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

58:58.523 --> 59:01.424
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

59:12.003 --> 59:14.437
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

59:14.472 --> 59:17.737
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

59:17.775 --> 59:19.606
Ha ha!

59:20.712 --> 59:23.408
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

59:23.448 --> 59:26.815
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

59:26.851 --> 59:29.820
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

59:29.854 --> 59:32.687
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

59:32.724 --> 59:33.918
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

59:33.958 --> 59:35.721
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

59:35.760 --> 59:37.284
I didn't see his face, but, um...

59:37.328 --> 59:39.523
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

59:39.564 --> 59:42.931
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

59:42.967 --> 59:44.832
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

59:44.869 --> 59:46.359
This is our lives, OK?

59:46.404 --> 59:48.668
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

59:48.706 --> 59:50.503
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

59:50.541 --> 59:53.442
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

59:53.478 --> 59:56.106
No. It's like... like a force.

59:56.147 --> 59:59.844
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

59:59.884 --> 01:00:02.352
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

01:00:02.387 --> 01:00:05.845
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:07.551
But there is awareness, McKinley.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:10.026
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:12.325
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

01:00:12.363 --> 01:00:14.126
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

01:00:15.566 --> 01:00:18.399
Ha ha!

01:00:20.705 --> 01:00:23.173
- Top shelf.
- OK.

01:00:31.182 --> 01:00:33.912
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

01:00:35.553 --> 01:00:37.077
lan, watch those boxes!

01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:45.059
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

01:00:45.096 --> 01:00:46.859
No, I said watch the boxes.

01:00:46.898 --> 01:00:48.525
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

01:00:48.566 --> 01:00:51.501
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:55.404
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.032
Oh. Yet.

01:00:57.075 --> 01:01:00.306
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

01:01:00.345 --> 01:01:02.711
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

01:01:02.747 --> 01:01:05.181
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

01:01:05.216 --> 01:01:08.014
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

01:01:08.052 --> 01:01:10.680
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

01:01:10.722 --> 01:01:12.155
Ha ha!

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:14.283
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

01:01:14.325 --> 01:01:16.885
It's simple. People die.

01:01:16.928 --> 01:01:18.327
That's just part of life.

01:01:18.363 --> 01:01:21.127
150,000 people a day, actually.

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:23.065
You know? I mean...

01:01:23.101 --> 01:01:25.126
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:27.467
- Top shelf.
- the end of biological function.

01:01:27.505 --> 01:01:28.494
It's as simple as that.

01:01:35.413 --> 01:01:37.881
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

01:01:37.915 --> 01:01:39.712
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:42.242
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

01:01:42.286 --> 01:01:44.618
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:48.557
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

01:01:48.593 --> 01:01:50.220
no one goes, like...

01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:53.389
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

01:01:53.431 --> 01:01:55.228
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

01:01:55.266 --> 01:01:58.429
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

01:01:58.469 --> 01:01:59.993
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

01:02:00.038 --> 01:02:03.496
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:05.941
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

01:02:05.977 --> 01:02:07.308
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:56.315
Unh!

01:02:58.830 --> 01:02:59.819
Heh heh!

01:03:12.843 --> 01:03:14.276
Ugh!

01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:15.903
Sick.

01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:53.012
OK.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.018
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

01:03:55.052 --> 01:03:56.349
Let's just say, you know...

01:03:56.386 --> 01:03:58.820
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

01:03:58.856 --> 01:04:01.188
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:04.388
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:06.259
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

01:04:06.296 --> 01:04:08.127
when he's working in our world.

01:04:08.165 --> 01:04:12.101
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

01:04:12.136 --> 01:04:15.196
So, that means that...

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:19.141
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

01:04:19.176 --> 01:04:21.371
And that that action
we take might have...

01:04:21.411 --> 01:04:23.971
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

01:04:24.014 --> 01:04:25.743
You're being a fucker, but go on.

01:04:25.782 --> 01:04:28.649
OK. OK.

01:04:28.685 --> 01:04:31.916
What if, for example...

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:36.756
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

01:04:38.095 --> 01:04:39.255
Kill themselves.

01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:43.865
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

01:04:43.901 --> 01:04:46.597
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

01:04:46.637 --> 01:04:50.505
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

01:04:56.613 --> 01:04:58.205
Any takers?

01:05:00.817 --> 01:05:03.115
Nah, I didn't think so.

01:05:12.796 --> 01:05:14.263
There! Those!

01:05:17.768 --> 01:05:19.497
Ugh!

01:05:19.536 --> 01:05:20.901
Aah!

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:25.132
Ooh!

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:33.438
Aah!

01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:35.440
Unh! Unh!

01:05:37.654 --> 01:05:38.882
Unh!

01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:54.399
Aah!

01:06:13.156 --> 01:06:15.283
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

01:06:15.325 --> 01:06:16.792
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

01:06:16.827 --> 01:06:18.818
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

01:06:18.862 --> 01:06:20.295
What'd you tell 'em?

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:22.560
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

01:06:22.599 --> 01:06:24.396
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

01:06:24.434 --> 01:06:25.594
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:28.002
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

01:06:28.038 --> 01:06:29.471
Did they believe you?

01:06:29.506 --> 01:06:31.531
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

01:06:31.575 --> 01:06:34.066
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:36.545
10 hours they had us in there.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.945
For all we know...

01:06:37.981 --> 01:06:39.846
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

01:06:39.883 --> 01:06:41.441
And we're next.

01:06:41.485 --> 01:06:43.009
Now.

01:06:45.856 --> 01:06:49.952
lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

01:06:49.993 --> 01:06:53.360
So it skipped lan.
That's... that's how we regain control.

01:06:53.397 --> 01:06:54.694
If someone intercedes...

01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:56.596
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:57.861
All right, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:57.901 --> 01:07:00.392
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

01:07:01.872 --> 01:07:05.035
Well, I'm next... and then you.

01:07:05.075 --> 01:07:08.238
We can beat this.

01:07:08.278 --> 01:07:11.042
We're so close.
We can't give up.

01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:15.513
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:18.521
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:20.420
It's just for a couple of hours.

01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:21.446
All right? A couple of hours.

01:07:21.491 --> 01:07:24.426
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:28.192
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

01:07:28.231 --> 01:07:30.290
OK?

01:07:32.636 --> 01:07:34.934
Was there something
I should know about going?

01:07:36.773 --> 01:07:38.934
No, it's just...

01:07:38.975 --> 01:07:41.466
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

01:07:41.511 --> 01:07:43.445
hoping you're OK.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.471
Why?

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:48.684
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

01:07:48.719 --> 01:07:51.347
Heh.

01:07:52.422 --> 01:07:53.912
Come here.

01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:00.156
OK?

01:08:00.196 --> 01:08:01.959
All right, I got my cell.

01:08:01.998 --> 01:08:03.295
OK.

01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:22.679
Hey, Wen?

01:08:22.718 --> 01:08:24.481
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.684
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

01:08:45.508 --> 01:08:46.497
Mmm.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.345
Huh.

01:09:29.585 --> 01:09:33.453
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

01:09:33.488 --> 01:09:35.389
Call me on my cell right away.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.192
Hello?

01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:44.131
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:45.997
What, your sister? No.

01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:47.366
No, she would've said
something by now.

01:09:47.403 --> 01:09:48.961
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

01:09:49.005 --> 01:09:50.631
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

01:09:50.673 --> 01:09:52.402
our grandmother gave her.

01:09:52.441 --> 01:09:54.432
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

01:09:54.477 --> 01:09:56.206
so they're next.

01:09:56.245 --> 01:09:57.610
I gotta find Julie.

01:09:57.647 --> 01:09:58.739
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

01:09:58.781 --> 01:10:00.772
Well, l... I'm here now,
working security.

01:10:00.816 --> 01:10:02.443
I'll start looking for her.

01:10:02.485 --> 01:10:04.419
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

01:10:04.453 --> 01:10:06.148
Look, after them, we're next.

01:10:06.188 --> 01:10:08.452
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:10.152
before we meet up...

01:10:10.192 --> 01:10:11.921
remember that time
we talked about?

01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:13.656
When to look at our pictures?

01:10:13.696 --> 01:10:15.425
It's now.

01:10:25.007 --> 01:10:26.736
Great. Mine has no clue.

01:10:26.776 --> 01:10:29.540
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

01:10:29.578 --> 01:10:31.944
with Jason at
the amusement park.

01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:34.950
Wait. McKinley.

01:10:34.984 --> 01:10:38.078
lan? Is he in the picture?

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.715
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

01:10:42.992 --> 01:10:45.324
And yours is the picture
that I took...

01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:47.090
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

01:10:47.129 --> 01:10:51.088
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

01:10:56.672 --> 01:10:58.367
Like a firework
went off in my face?

01:11:23.899 --> 01:11:27.096
# There is someone #

01:11:27.136 --> 01:11:30.264
# Walking behind you #

01:11:33.509 --> 01:11:36.740
# Look at me #

01:11:36.779 --> 01:11:38.610
# There is someone #

01:11:38.647 --> 01:11:42.549
# Watching your footsteps #

01:11:45.287 --> 01:11:47.187
# Look at me #

01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:52.158
# There is someone #

01:11:52.194 --> 01:11:54.424
# Who really loves you #

01:11:54.463 --> 01:11:56.590
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

01:11:56.632 --> 01:11:59.157
- Whoo!
- Yay!

01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:00.793
Get 'em while they're hot!

01:12:05.508 --> 01:12:07.669
Take it to those Redcoats!

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:10.008
Column, advance!

01:12:22.057 --> 01:12:23.957
The kite is aloft.

01:12:25.427 --> 01:12:28.225
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

01:12:28.264 --> 01:12:30.824
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

01:12:39.074 --> 01:12:42.271
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.573
This is awesome, dude!

01:12:46.615 --> 01:12:47.877
Heh heh.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.282
Whoa. Hey!

01:12:49.318 --> 01:12:50.751
Ha ha! Come on!

01:12:50.786 --> 01:12:52.777
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

01:12:52.822 --> 01:12:54.289
Hurry, dude.

01:12:54.323 --> 01:12:55.722
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

01:12:57.226 --> 01:13:00.957
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

01:13:00.996 --> 01:13:03.726
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

01:13:08.871 --> 01:13:10.395
Oh, my God. Julie.

01:13:10.439 --> 01:13:11.406
- What?
- Look.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.340
There's Kahlil.

01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:14.967
Should we?

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:16.671
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

01:13:16.712 --> 01:13:19.010
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

01:13:19.048 --> 01:13:20.879
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:22.508
I don't fucking believe them.

01:13:22.551 --> 01:13:25.042
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

01:13:31.627 --> 01:13:33.117
Excuse me.

01:13:58.254 --> 01:13:59.778
- Ladies.
- Boys.

01:13:59.822 --> 01:14:00.811
What's going on?

01:14:02.024 --> 01:14:03.855
Hey, Julie.

01:14:03.893 --> 01:14:06.327
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

01:14:06.362 --> 01:14:08.057
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

01:14:08.097 --> 01:14:09.928
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

01:14:09.965 --> 01:14:11.796
Let go of me!

01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:12.892
Julie.

01:14:12.935 --> 01:14:14.129
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:14.169 --> 01:14:15.329
Julie!

01:14:43.132 --> 01:14:44.156
Heh heh heh!

01:14:45.701 --> 01:14:47.134
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

01:14:50.406 --> 01:14:51.395
Yeah!

01:14:54.743 --> 01:14:56.005
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:03.547
Julie!

01:15:07.323 --> 01:15:08.813
Uh! Oh!

01:15:13.228 --> 01:15:14.786
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

01:15:29.278 --> 01:15:30.575
- Aah!
- Unh!

01:15:30.612 --> 01:15:32.944
Unh! Hey!

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:37.613
Julie! No, wait, wait.

01:15:37.653 --> 01:15:40.121
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

01:15:40.155 --> 01:15:42.885
Let me explain this to you.

01:15:46.795 --> 01:15:48.228
Julie, look out!

01:15:49.598 --> 01:15:51.395
- Aah!
- Unh!

01:15:52.935 --> 01:15:54.732
Aah!

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:55.862
Julie!

01:15:56.872 --> 01:15:58.396
Unh!

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.271
Aah! Unh!

01:16:02.177 --> 01:16:03.701
Cut him off!

01:16:08.617 --> 01:16:09.914
Unh!

01:16:11.487 --> 01:16:12.476
Aah!

01:16:15.758 --> 01:16:16.747
Aah!

01:16:19.228 --> 01:16:20.627
Aah!

01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:29.468
OK, OK.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.205
Stay back! He's dangerous!

01:16:36.645 --> 01:16:37.771
I got him.

01:16:37.813 --> 01:16:40.008
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

01:16:40.049 --> 01:16:41.243
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

01:16:41.283 --> 01:16:43.547
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

01:16:43.585 --> 01:16:45.450
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

01:16:47.156 --> 01:16:48.453
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:50.355
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

01:16:50.392 --> 01:16:52.792
Who? She's next!

01:16:57.366 --> 01:16:59.061
Aah!

01:17:11.413 --> 01:17:12.744
Kevin.

01:17:22.825 --> 01:17:24.315
Aah!

01:17:24.359 --> 01:17:26.020
Fire!

01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:28.256
Kevin.

01:17:28.297 --> 01:17:31.824
You saved my life.

01:17:37.539 --> 01:17:38.938
Thanks for that, McKinley.

01:17:38.974 --> 01:17:40.942
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

01:17:40.976 --> 01:17:42.443
We have to get out of here now.

01:17:42.478 --> 01:17:43.638
What's the deal?

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:46.273
lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

01:17:46.315 --> 01:17:48.442
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

01:17:48.484 --> 01:17:50.247
- He's the clue.
- What?

01:17:50.285 --> 01:17:52.276
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

01:17:54.456 --> 01:17:56.424
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

01:17:56.458 --> 01:18:00.519
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:04.690
You followed me!

01:18:04.733 --> 01:18:06.633
Oh! You are paranoid.

01:18:06.668 --> 01:18:08.727
But, hey, I saw what happened.

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:11.534
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

01:18:11.573 --> 01:18:12.972
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

01:18:13.008 --> 01:18:14.805
You didn't even believe me!

01:18:14.843 --> 01:18:17.903
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

01:18:17.946 --> 01:18:19.641
Then you have
to stay away from me!

01:18:19.681 --> 01:18:22.912
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

01:18:27.623 --> 01:18:29.750
Oh, no way.

01:18:31.426 --> 01:18:33.121
Do I cause your death?

01:18:34.796 --> 01:18:36.730
Just like you caused Erin's?

01:18:37.766 --> 01:18:39.757
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

01:18:39.801 --> 01:18:42.668
You have a vision? Was I in it?

01:18:42.704 --> 01:18:44.604
Was I in a picture?

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.309
Just tell me how to start it off!

01:18:49.344 --> 01:18:52.006
Let's get this over with!

01:18:52.047 --> 01:18:54.777
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

01:18:54.816 --> 01:18:56.113
Then it'll all be over!

01:18:56.151 --> 01:18:59.120
What do I care? It skipped me.

01:18:59.154 --> 01:19:00.951
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

01:19:00.989 --> 01:19:03.856
I'm not dying!

01:19:14.369 --> 01:19:16.064
Ha ha ha!

01:19:16.104 --> 01:19:18.163
You see?

01:19:18.207 --> 01:19:19.469
I'm not gonna die!

01:19:19.508 --> 01:19:21.806
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

01:19:57.444 --> 01:20:00.641
# Came back down
from this fight #

01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:02.171
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:03.581
# And make you right #

01:20:03.617 --> 01:20:04.641
Thank you.

01:20:04.685 --> 01:20:07.449
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

01:20:07.488 --> 01:20:08.716
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

01:20:08.756 --> 01:20:10.155
Don't we get off at Booth?

01:20:10.191 --> 01:20:12.056
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

01:20:12.092 --> 01:20:13.650
Oh, that's right.

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:17.363
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:20.161
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:22.394
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

01:20:22.668 --> 01:20:23.965
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

01:20:24.003 --> 01:20:25.630
is that really gonna kill you?

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:29.767
# There is someone #

01:20:29.808 --> 01:20:33.266
# Walking behind you #

01:20:33.312 --> 01:20:36.611
# Turn around #

01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:40.346
# Look at me #

01:20:40.386 --> 01:20:43.753
# There is someone #

01:20:43.789 --> 01:20:47.657
# Watching your footsteps #

01:20:47.693 --> 01:20:48.955
# Turn around #

01:20:56.502 --> 01:20:59.767
# There is someone #

01:20:59.805 --> 01:21:03.935
# Who really needs you #

01:21:03.976 --> 01:21:06.843
# Here's my heart #

01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:38.601
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:21:41.413 --> 01:21:42.778
This is Booth Street.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:47.252
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

01:21:47.286 --> 01:21:51.347
The next stop
is the end of the line.

01:21:52.391 --> 01:21:55.155
Wendy! Next stop after this.

01:21:55.194 --> 01:21:57.458
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.123
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.928
I could use some air.

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:07.030
Yeah!

01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:08.300
Ha ha ha! Yeah, man!

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.671
All right, man. See ya.

01:22:09.708 --> 01:22:10.732
Let's go, Bruins!

01:22:10.776 --> 01:22:11.765
Bruins, yeah!

01:22:27.659 --> 01:22:29.183
Hey, man, peace out!

01:22:29.228 --> 01:22:30.752
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

01:22:30.796 --> 01:22:33.196
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

01:22:33.232 --> 01:22:35.223
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

01:22:35.267 --> 01:22:36.393
This is it!

01:22:36.435 --> 01:22:40.064
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

01:22:42.107 --> 01:22:44.041
Oh, my God.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:48.809
I can't believe this. Here.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.518
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:56.214
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

01:22:56.255 --> 01:22:58.689
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.521
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:01.924
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.894
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

01:23:03.929 --> 01:23:05.692
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.892
No, no, it's just, um...

01:23:07.933 --> 01:23:11.664
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.008
I was just...

01:23:18.043 --> 01:23:21.376
I was feeling like I did that night.

01:23:22.381 --> 01:23:24.372
No. No, it's over.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:27.283
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

01:23:27.319 --> 01:23:28.616
lan was gonna cause your death...

01:23:28.654 --> 01:23:30.451
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

01:23:37.129 --> 01:23:39.859
Look, I'm not worried.

01:23:39.898 --> 01:23:42.833
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

01:23:42.868 --> 01:23:44.130
And, if I were you...

01:23:44.169 --> 01:23:46.535
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

01:23:46.572 --> 01:23:48.199
you've got nothing
to worry about.

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:51.372
You're right.

01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:53.241
Uhh.

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.439
Hey, l... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.572
Yeah.

01:23:58.517 --> 01:23:59.916
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

01:24:11.563 --> 01:24:13.895
What are you doing here?

01:24:13.932 --> 01:24:16.127
Wendy! Julie!

01:24:16.168 --> 01:24:18.068
What are the chances?

01:24:18.103 --> 01:24:19.468
How long have you been
on this train?

01:24:19.504 --> 01:24:21.096
Uh, since home.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.970
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

01:24:23.008 --> 01:24:24.566
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

01:24:27.179 --> 01:24:28.407
You OK?

01:24:28.447 --> 01:24:30.210
Is something wrong?

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.813
Aah!

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:52.830
Aah!

01:24:59.077 --> 01:25:00.339
Aah!

01:25:02.915 --> 01:25:05.611
- Aah!
- Unh!

01:25:08.153 --> 01:25:10.144
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:12.418
Julie!

01:25:12.457 --> 01:25:13.446
Aah!

01:25:18.597 --> 01:25:20.064
- Kevin!
- Unh!

01:25:21.667 --> 01:25:22.759
Aaaaaah!

01:25:23.769 --> 01:25:25.600
Oh, God!

01:25:25.637 --> 01:25:26.763
Aah!

01:25:27.773 --> 01:25:30.173
Aah!
