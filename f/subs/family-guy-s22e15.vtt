So, Brian's checkup
went very well.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.686
He only bit me eight times while
I tried to brush his teeth.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.856
Wonderful. And does he have
the red, hairless undercarriage

00:41.876 --> 00:43.600
-of an older dog?
-He sure does.

00:43.619 --> 00:46.045
He's the Jason Alexander
of hairless scroti.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.621
And you know,
if you're interested,

00:47.773 --> 00:49.381
we're doing a 50% off promotion

00:49.458 --> 00:51.366

tracking chip.

00:51.443 --> 00:54.278
It connects to an app
that will monitor Brian's vitals

00:54.296 --> 00:55.796
and even has a Bluetooth speaker

00:55.890 --> 00:57.281
so you can play songs
through him.

00:57.283 --> 00:58.799
Awesome! I'm gonna
blast Ed Sheeran

00:58.951 --> 01:00.133
right through his stomach.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.062
That'll really showcase
my milquetoast personality

01:03.213 --> 01:04.879
and lack of masculine vigor.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.214
Great. I'll introduce you
to our nurse

01:06.292 --> 01:07.048
who handles the procedure.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.567
Hi, I'm Emma.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.644
And don't worry, I'm wearing
scrubs that hide my tattoos

01:10.720 --> 01:11.978
to give you confidence.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.815
Terrific. And now, like
in every hospital situation,

01:14.967 --> 01:17.242
I'll depart and a woman
will do the actual work.

01:19.563 --> 01:21.205
Okay, we're almost done.

01:22.566 --> 01:24.065

You're very gentle.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.483

Thanks. I love animals.

01:33.577 --> 01:35.001
It's why I do this.

01:35.154 --> 01:38.155
I even pride myself on being
able to find every dog's spot,

01:38.248 --> 01:39.431
right behind the ears.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.825
Well, maybe you can
find mine sometime.

01:41.844 --> 01:43.418
I'd be tempted
to ask you to coffee,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.679
but I'm sure a girl like you
is already seeing someone.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.848
I wish. Guys don't want
a girlfriend

01:47.942 --> 01:49.775

smelling like dog pee.

01:53.763 --> 01:56.173
Yeah, and my car's so filthy.

I need someone to stick
their head out the window

01:58.026 --> 01:59.100

01:59.120 --> 02:00.285
H-Head-- head out the window?

02:00.512 --> 02:03.029
To be honest, all I like to do
is play tennis,

02:03.182 --> 02:04.456
but I'm not even that good.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.291
I keep hitting the balls
over the fence

02:06.443 --> 02:07.868
and have no one
to retrieve them--

02:08.020 --> 02:10.278

02:10.297 --> 02:13.023
Well, I'm going
to a concert this Friday.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.025

It's at Quahog Church.

02:15.043 --> 02:18.028

Christian rock?

02:18.046 --> 02:20.121

Wow. Look at all our diversity.

Can you believe most people
think us evangelicals

04:08.064 --> 04:09.581
No. Come on.

Seriously, it's true.

Hey, I-I don't normally do this,

04:13.662 --> 04:16.813
but what do you say we go back
to my place after this

04:16.906 --> 04:18.740
and get a little crazy?

04:18.834 --> 04:20.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.837
We'll eat sherbet and watch
funny State Farm commercials.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.914

and then we'll have sex?

04:27.009 --> 04:29.175
Sex? Brian, I'm Christian.

04:29.328 --> 04:31.753

believes in sex before marriage,

politician you've ever heard of.

04:34.257 --> 04:37.517

05:22.489 --> 05:24.881
So much of the division
and hatred in today's society

05:24.974 --> 05:27.567
comes from Christianity.
And it's so hypocritical.

05:27.719 --> 05:29.719
I mean, they all vote for Trump,
even though he's divorced.

05:29.888 --> 05:31.071
That's all you've got on Trump?

05:31.223 --> 05:34.240
Christianity is also
anti-science, anti-freedom--

Christianity is the worst thing

that ever happened
to this country. Or the world.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.183
Well, perhaps. But it's been
around for 2,000 years,

05:51.334 --> 05:53.518

anything you can do about it.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.849

18:30.001 --> 18:31.167
<i> I-I'm sorry, Tom,</i>

18:31.185 --> 18:32.443

18:39.193 --> 18:40.601
[in deep voice]
Afternoon, Brian.

18:40.678 --> 18:43.121
Hey, Mort.
Uh, why is your voice so deep?

18:43.272 --> 18:44.513
Why shouldn't it be?

18:44.532 --> 18:46.106
Millennia of
not running from people

18:46.200 --> 18:48.868
has made me remarkably
confident and relaxed.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.962
You know, I like Jewish Quahog.

18:51.189 --> 18:52.446
Yeah, we did
a good thing, Stewie.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.799
A Jewish world is much better
than a Christian one.

18:54.984 --> 18:58.386
There are no absurd, stifling
rules driving everyone crazy.

18:59.364 --> 19:00.471
There you guys are.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.457
It's almost sundown,
so let's turn off our devices

19:03.476 --> 19:05.643
-and walk three miles to temple.
-What?

19:05.870 --> 19:07.770
Ha! You were saying, Brian?

19:08.556 --> 19:09.814
We have to go back in time

19:10.041 --> 19:12.633
and stop Moses from receiving
the Ten Commandments.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.303
That way, neither Judaism nor
Christianity will ever exist.

19:16.397 --> 19:17.488
On it.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.900
-Done.
-How'd you do that so fast?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.994
I gave Moses 20 bucks
to walk away.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.387
And before you say anything,

19:24.405 --> 19:25.812
that was
a lot of money back then.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.373
Anyone would have done it.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.078
Happy November 25th.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.898
Only 30 shopping days
till nothing.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.008
Brian, it worked.

19:37.159 --> 19:38.342
That's only
half the story, Stewie.

19:38.494 --> 19:39.660
Let's make sure.

19:40.571 --> 19:42.513
Hey, guys?
Who does Mel Gibson hate?

19:42.665 --> 19:45.424
Uh, all of his ex-wives,
but no generalized group.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.501
It did work.
Finally, a world with

19:47.595 --> 19:51.022
no religion, no prejudices,
no irrationalities.

19:51.249 --> 19:53.524
-Just science-based reason.
-[knock on door]

19:54.752 --> 19:55.935
Package for Brian and Stewie?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.361
Yeah, that's us.

19:57.588 --> 19:59.438
What did you do,
you little twerps?

19:59.532 --> 20:00.531
Oh, my God. God!

20:00.683 --> 20:01.757
Fix it. Fix it.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.201
-Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.
-Ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:03.352 --> 20:04.702
It was his idea!
It's not even my machine!

20:04.929 --> 20:07.446
You don't think Einstein
and Carl Sagan tried this crap?

20:07.598 --> 20:09.040
I had to send
them to Noogie City.

20:09.191 --> 20:10.208
Is that where you want to live?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.451
Noogie City? Huh?
'Cause I can take you there.

20:12.603 --> 20:13.694
I got the keys, hoss.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.046
[both grunting]

20:15.273 --> 20:16.805
Is this all religion is?

20:16.865 --> 20:18.049
Threatening to noogie people

20:18.200 --> 20:19.458
if they dare to think
for themselves?

20:19.610 --> 20:21.961
Yes. I'm basically Biff
from<i> Back to the Future,</i>

20:22.055 --> 20:23.370
and you're all George McFly.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.205
All right, I got to take
a picture of the package

20:25.299 --> 20:26.891
on your doorstep,
or they don't believe me.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.226
You're really a delivery man?

20:28.377 --> 20:29.969
Yeah. No collection plate.

20:30.121 --> 20:31.804
I got to pay for
Dish Network somehow.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.898
Oh, boy, we really
messed with this guy.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.716
I guess we should
go fix it, Brian.

20:35.810 --> 20:36.901
You know what? No.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.403
A world without religion
is a world that values

20:39.555 --> 20:42.298
reason and logic to better
the world for everyone.

20:42.316 --> 20:43.966
And I'm not gonna
let some two-bit boomer--

20:44.059 --> 20:45.892
yeah, you heard me--
tell us otherwise.
