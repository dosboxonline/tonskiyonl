WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:07.549
<i>I thought I'd seen it all.</i>

00:07.632 --> 00:10.468
<i>But that's the thing
about Quahog.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:13.722
<i>You never know what's hiding
under the hard shell of a clam.</i>

00:15.348 --> 00:18.059
<i>The Great Depression
hit the town hard.</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:21.855
<i>FDR announced we had nothing
to fear but fear itself.</i>

00:21.938 --> 00:23.857
<i>ROOSEVELT
The only thing we have to fear</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:25.859
<i>is fear itself.</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:27.861
<i>And, also, bees.</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:30.655
<i>Or when a man has a beard
and then shaves it.</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:33.867
<i>'Cause I don't
recognize him immediately.</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:36.286
<i>If I watched him shave it,
it would be different.</i>

00:36.369 --> 00:38.747
<i>If I saw the process.</i>

00:38.830 --> 00:42.584
<i>And there's this guy Hitler we
should probably keep an eye on.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:44.669
<i>But mostly bees.</i>

00:44.753 --> 00:47.005
<i>It was also the height
of Prohibition.</i>

00:47.088 --> 00:49.007
Water or seltzer, anyone?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.468
<i>Which of course meant
drinking was very cool,</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:54.179
<i>and everyone did it
all the time.</i>

00:54.262 --> 00:56.181
<i>And of course, there was racism.</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:58.266
<i>A lot of it. It was horrible.</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:01.227
<i>Except for the laundromat,
which served everyone.</i>

01:01.311 --> 01:03.646
Thanks for doing
my undergarments.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.690
<i>They were really nice.</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:07.108
<i>So, who am I?</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:09.569
<i>The name's Mac. Mac Bookpro.</i>

01:09.652 --> 01:12.614
<i>And I'm a private dick.</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:16.201
<i>A very private dick.</i>

01:16.284 --> 01:18.370
And don't listen.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.687
<i>My office was in
the Cocaine-Cola building.</i>

02:25.770 --> 02:28.606
<i>All the businessmen there
had ideas for other businesses.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:30.650
Well, Mac,
what did you find out?

02:30.734 --> 02:33.153
Now hold on, it's 8:00 a.m.
and we're two men in a room.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.238
Let me fix you a drink.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.368
So, I tailed your wife.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.245
Sorry, pal,
she's having an affair.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.749
Ah, too bad.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.793
I guess she's the maple,
but I'm the sap.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.754
There you go.
You're gonna be okay.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.506
But it's 8:00 a.m., and you're
a man about to get in a car.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.509
Let me fix you another drink.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.179
Thanks, Mac. I owe you one.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.805
Mr. Bookpro?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.974
Yes, Ms. Patbottom?

03:03.058 --> 03:04.517
Oh, Mr. Bookpro.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.728
<i>My secretary, Fanny Patbottom.</i>

03:06.811 --> 03:08.563
<i>She's my gal Thursday.</i>

03:08.646 --> 03:10.148
<i>She has choir practice Fridays.</i>

03:10.231 --> 03:12.734
<i>She's, uh, not available
to me then.</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:14.361
Now, a couple of items
of business.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.196
First, we're going
to have to postpone

03:16.279 --> 03:18.573
today's tangling
of the Venetian blinds.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.200
I think we're gonna have
to start sending the schedule

03:20.283 --> 03:21.576
the night before.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.746
Also, there's a woman
here to see you.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.915
May I come in, Mr. Bookpro?

03:29.417 --> 03:32.837
<i>I'll never forget the day
she walked through my door.</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:36.383
Ah, damn it. And this was
the smallest brim they had.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.305
The name's Hedy.
Hedy Toothgraze.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.308
<i>She was the type of girl
who really left a mark on you.</i>

03:45.392 --> 03:47.268
Please, have a seat.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.020
Do you mind if I don't smoke?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.522
I'm afraid I do.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.400
Totally understand.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.403
So, we're two people in a room
at 8:04 a.m.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.863
Let me fix you a drink.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.033
So, Mr. Bookpro, I'm here
because my daughter is missing.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.451
She's a nun.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.161
Frankly, we weren't that close.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.914
I gave her to the Church after
my husband died in the war.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.458
So, will you take the case?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.836
<i>I wasn't sure I could trust her,
but I needed the dough.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:14.421
<i>My rent was two bucks a month</i>

04:14.504 --> 04:16.715
<i>and I still owed
50 cents on my car.</i>

04:19.551 --> 04:21.636
<i>Since the missing gal was a nun,</i>

04:21.720 --> 04:23.680
<i>I decided to start
at the Church.</i>

04:27.809 --> 04:29.644
Greetings, my son.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.438
Cardinal St. Louis,
likely bad guy.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.856
Mac Bookpro.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.774
Sorry to bother you
about a case, Padre.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.984
Do you want to talk here,

04:36.067 --> 04:37.694
or should I come
inside your rectory?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.612
Okay, Groucho, calm down.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.365
I'm here looking for a nun.
Recognize her?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.076
Of course, that's Sister Megan.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.703
She runs the church orphanage.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.121
And how about this photo?

04:49.664 --> 04:50.874
I don't know.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.250
Any dunking photo
where you don't see the ground

04:52.334 --> 04:54.586
- is very suspicious.
- I see.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.588
So, when was the last time
you saw the sister?

04:56.671 --> 04:58.798
In the church garden,
wearing giant nun boots

04:58.882 --> 05:00.216
and trying to step on squirrels.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.634
Yeah, that checks out.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.970
If you think of anything,
here's my card.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.931
"To my beloved niece."

05:07.015 --> 05:09.225
Aw, and he wrote his own note

05:09.309 --> 05:10.852
instead of just signing
his name.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.146
I like that guy now. He cares.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.357
Hey, Mac.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.193
Well, if it isn't my old pal
Red Wiener?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.487
<i>Red was the best
newspaper guy out there.</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:22.113
<i>Except when the newspaper
was rolled up,</i>

05:22.197 --> 05:23.531
<i>then he was kind of scared.</i>

05:23.615 --> 05:26.117
So, what's got you sniffing
around here today, Fido?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.911
Same as you, pal. Sister Megan.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.621
I heard you talking
to the cardinal.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.831
Well,
she called me a few days ago

05:31.915 --> 05:33.416
and said she had a big story.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.251
We were supposed to meet
at a speakeasy,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.462
but she disappeared
before we could get together.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.298
A nun at a speakeasy?
That doesn't figure.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.592
- Maybe we should check it out.
- You got it.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.302
Say, can we go to the next scene
with one of those

05:44.386 --> 05:46.888
cinematic sideways wipes
they used to do in the '30s?

05:46.971 --> 05:49.015
I don't know, I did
a sideways wipe this morning.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.350
I don't recommend it.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.519
Not a good way to make friends
on the trolley.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.817
What's the word?

05:58.900 --> 06:02.237
- Bird.
- Bird is the word.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.948
Welcome to The Sunken Clam.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.952
What can I get you fellas?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.287
Two this-period fashioneds,
please.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.456
We're looking for a girl
who was supposed to show here.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.833
You ever seen her?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.335
Hmm. Doesn't ring a bell.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.129
Well, no one has any idea
what happened to her.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.172
Not even her boss, the cardinal.

06:21.256 --> 06:25.010
The cardinal? Let me tell you,
that priest is a shady cat.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.512
I heard that when the state
voted on Prohibition,

06:27.595 --> 06:30.432
he rigged the vote
to get alcohol banned.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.517
I tell you, something's
going on at that church,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.186
and I'm not gonna rest
until I get to the bottom of it.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.688
Yeah, I'm with you, pal.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.440
Two more Black girls
recently went missing.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.483
Maybe you can
look into that, too?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.028
- Oh, boy, you know,
I am just so busy...
- Yeah, I am absolutely swamped.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.780
-...with this
Sister Megan thing.
- Just buried in paperwork.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.323
<i>With the case heating up,</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:49.993
<i>I decided to visit my friend
down at the station.</i>

06:50.076 --> 06:52.662
<i>I hadn't been back since
they kicked me off the force.</i>

06:52.746 --> 06:55.123
<i>For years they'd been letting
horses poop on the street.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:57.375
<i>But I do it one time
and I'm out.</i>

06:57.459 --> 06:59.544
<i>But I still had
one friend there.</i>

06:59.627 --> 07:01.546
<i>My old buddy Ace.</i>

07:01.629 --> 07:03.131
<i>Ace Hardware.</i>

07:03.214 --> 07:04.632
So, Mac, what brings you here?

07:04.716 --> 07:06.801
- Looking for a girl.
- A girl, huh?

07:06.885 --> 07:10.305
Yeah. You know, a skirt,
a bird, a twist, a roundheel.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.475
<i>I spent most of my time at
the library looking up synonyms.</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:15.518
She's a nun. Sister Megan.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.145
I think the cardinal
had something to do

07:17.228 --> 07:19.022
- with her disappearance.
- Oh, the cardinal?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.857
I'd be careful if I were you.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.609
He's a heavy hitter
in this town.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.112
A big cheese, a head honcho,
a real butter and egg man.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.615
<i>I also spent most of my time
at the library</i>

07:28.698 --> 07:30.450
<i>looking up synonyms.</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:32.702
If I were you,
I'd wheel away from this one.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.580
Wheel far, far away.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.583
<i>The cops and the cardinal
were both dead ends.</i>

07:38.667 --> 07:39.709
<i>I was starting to wonder
whether the sister</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:41.086
<i>was even missing.</i>

07:41.169 --> 07:43.838
<i>And then, a couple of friends
pulled up.</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:50.470
<i>They cornered me
in Kirstie Alley,</i>

07:50.553 --> 07:52.555
<i>the widest alley in Quahog.</i>

07:52.639 --> 07:55.558
Hey, Mac.
Fancy meeting you here.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.602
Well, if it isn't Bogey
and Bacaw.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.812
Oof.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.979
I hear you've been
snooping around

08:00.063 --> 08:01.690
the disappearance of a nun.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.025
Well, I didn't mean to ruffle
anyone's feathers.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.527
Oof again.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.696
You used to be smarter
than this, Mac.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.531
Before you got kicked off
the force,

08:09.614 --> 08:11.366
you knew how to play ball.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.493
But now, here we are.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.457
<i>Luckily, they let me
go with a warning.</i>

08:19.541 --> 08:21.710
<i>My shadow wasn't so lucky.</i>

08:21.793 --> 08:23.753
<i>My cop friend told me
to stay away from the case,</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:25.755
<i>and I was starting
to think he was right.</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:28.216
<i>But then I got the call
I'd been dreading.</i>

08:28.299 --> 08:30.427
- Hello?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.388
<i>American Dad's</i> been picked up
for three more seasons?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.974
God, when do I get a weekend?

08:37.267 --> 08:38.810
<i>Then I got another call.</i>

08:38.893 --> 08:40.812
<i>They found Sister Megan.</i>

08:45.900 --> 08:47.819
Well, one thing's for sure.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.572
We've got a killer shark
on our hands.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.490
Close the beaches.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.343
I can't believe
my daughter's dead.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.803
Doctor, are there any leads
from the body?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.014
Anything that can tell us
who did this?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.725
Well, not yet, but I've sent
some DNA samples to the lab.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.186
- When will we get the results?
- About 65 years.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.813
- Nuts.
- I did find one thing, though.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.108
There was a roll of camera film
hidden in her waistband.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.152
Thanks, Doc. Maybe it's a clue.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.113
No problem, Mac.
But there is one more thing.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.410
Uh...

09:37.494 --> 09:40.246
Uhp. Nope, no. I lost it.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.542
Oh, dear. What am I gonna do?

09:44.626 --> 09:47.128
My daughter's dead,
and I'm single.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.963
Who wants a woman
without a child?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.882
I think you got that backwards.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.425
Listen, it's been
a long couple of days.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.177
What do you say
I take you out tonight?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.804
We'll go to the Supper Club.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.224
Mr. Bookpro, what kind
of a private dick are you?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.767
The kind that was a public one

10:00.850 --> 10:02.185
until he got arrested
in the park.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.036
Say, I noticed you've
only had three Scotches

10:20.120 --> 10:21.663
and five cigarettes.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.289
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.209
I still can't believe you drove
us here in a fudge Packard.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.670
Stop calling it that.
It's just a dark brown car.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.588
So, you got a light?

10:30.672 --> 10:33.216
I got a lot of lights,
but nowhere to plug them in.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.467
Maybe I could help with that.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.553
You help me?
I'm gonna bust out crying.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.804
Hope you got a hanky.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.056
I'll bring the hanky,
you bring the panky.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.100
You're awfully quick
with the wit, Mr. Bookpro.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.144
- I hear you're quick
with the feet.
- You could say that.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.854
I was the lead dancer
in <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

10:45.937 --> 10:47.480
Huh. Must be a ballet
about my ex-wife.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.317
<i>Divorce was new,
and I was the first guy</i>

10:51.401 --> 10:53.361
<i>to make that joke.</i>

10:56.823 --> 10:58.324
Good morning, Mr. Bookpro.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.286
So, I'm turning 21 tomorrow,
and my parents are throwing me

11:01.369 --> 11:02.996
a Miserable Spinster party.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.331
- Care to attend?
- No, thanks, Ms. Patbottom.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.000
Me and my vaudeville group
have a show,

11:07.083 --> 11:08.209
but if you maybe
want to stop by...

11:08.293 --> 11:10.879
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.797
Say "cream cheese."

11:12.881 --> 11:15.383
<i>We hadn't realized
that just "cheese" would work.</i>

11:15.467 --> 11:19.137
Hey, Mac, I developed that film
you found on the girl.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.225
What? It's the cardinal
with mobsters.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.518
How do you know
they're mobsters?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.979
What other Italians
can afford Italian suits?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.523
I wonder why a cardinal
would meet with the mob.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.941
Well, maybe they were
in cahoots,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.276
Sister Megan discovered it,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.362
and that's why the cardinal
had her killed?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.156
Good thinking, Ms. Patbottom.
Let me give you a raise.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.534
Oh, Mr. Bookpro,
I don't know what to say.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.286
Hey, Mac, there's a couple
more photos.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.497
Including the cardinal
with some broad.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.334
What the rumpus? That's Hedy.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.294
I wonder what her connection
is to the cardinal?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.712
Why don't you just call and ask?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.339
No way. We just went out,

11:54.422 --> 11:57.050
which means I got to wait
three days, at least.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.514
<i>The cardinal was definitely up
to something fishy,</i>

12:02.597 --> 12:04.432
<i>and I needed to find out what.</i>

12:04.516 --> 12:06.726
<i>Luckily, I knew
just the guy to see.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:12.190
Not so fast, Carol.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.027
Carol is a very acceptable
man's name for this time period.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.489
That's a very defensive response
for something I didn't bring up.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.658
Everyone knows
you're dumb muscle for the mob.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.493
Tell me what you know
about the cardinal.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.870
Sorry, pal. I ain't talking.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.997
I'll give you a peacoat
to wear at the docks.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.958
- Collar up?
- It's a peacoat, isn't it?

12:30.041 --> 12:32.085
Will the buttons have anchors?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.170
You want anchor buttons,
start spilling.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.589
What's the connection between
the mob and the cardinal?

12:36.673 --> 12:37.882
The mob works with the cardinal

12:37.966 --> 12:39.759
'cause he's the biggest
bootlegger in town.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.637
He sneaks in booze from Italy
aboard Church ships.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.806
And because the contents
are supposed to be religious,

12:44.889 --> 12:46.516
no one checks.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.102
What? But the cardinal's
against alcohol.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.187
He even rigged the vote
to get it banned.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.691
Wake up. He didn't rig the vote
because he's against drinking.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.527
He did it so he could have
the market all to himself.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.654
It was a ruse, a sham,
a snow job.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.281
Pure hokum all the way.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.241
Nothing but pork pie.

13:03.324 --> 13:07.245
<i>I also spent most of my time
looking up synonyms.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:12.542
<i>I'd have to figure out
Hedy's involvement later.</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:16.671
<i>But first, it was time to pay
another visit to the cardinal.</i>

13:21.176 --> 13:23.136
Hello, Padre.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.597
Funny I'd find you here
in the church bathroom.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.015
This is the confessional.

13:27.098 --> 13:30.435
Well, then, I have
something to confess.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.062
Ugh, mother of mercy.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.563
How much mutton do you eat?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.106
Hey, you're supposed
to be forgiving.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.649
This is a safe space.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.109
And anyway, Father,
you're the one

13:38.193 --> 13:39.778
who's gonna do
the confessing today.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.863
For the murder of Sister Megan.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.740
- Oof.
- The truth hurts,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.158
doesn't it, Cardinal?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.376
What the rumpus?

13:54.459 --> 13:56.461
- Freeze.
- Ace, thank God.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.088
Somebody just stabbed
the cardinal

13:58.171 --> 13:59.464
and ran out the back door.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.675
And they stole all
the cardinal's Andes candies

14:01.758 --> 14:03.093
and put them in my pocket.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.678
Nice try, Mac.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.262
We got an anonymous tip

14:06.346 --> 14:08.723
that a heavyset man entered
the church with a knife.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.351
And funny thing, we got
that tip right after getting

14:11.434 --> 14:14.187
the ballistics report
on Sister Megan's murder.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.690
She was killed with your gun.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.525
What? You don't think...

14:18.608 --> 14:20.860
Sorry. I have
to take you downtown.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.862
Dinner and a show?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.948
No, Mac. Cuff him.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.200
Come on, Ace. You can't
send me to the hoosegow,

14:27.283 --> 14:29.744
the big house,
the graybar saloon, the stir.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.579
And take his thesaurus.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.332
What? I need that.
It's important.

14:34.416 --> 14:38.086
Just, you know, very, very,
very, very important.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.682
Hey, Mac, you made bail.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.768
Really? Who in this town
has three dollars?

14:53.852 --> 14:56.062
Listen here, Mac.
I know you were framed.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.522
And I want you to figure out
who did it

14:57.605 --> 14:59.024
so I can write the story.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.942
Yeah, it'll be front-page news.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.485
Well, not-not front-page.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.904
A giant gorilla in Manhattan
just escaped its restraints

15:04.988 --> 15:07.407
- and kidnapped a lady.
- Oh, my stars.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.200
But either way,
you'll get your story.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.703
I've got a pretty good idea
who set me up.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.621
Taxi.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.709
Where to?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.961
<i>His whole face had been
blown off in the war.</i>

15:20.045 --> 15:22.630
<i>Probably left it somewhere
in the French countryside.</i>

15:22.714 --> 15:24.758
Hey, guys?

15:24.841 --> 15:27.344
Did you go home?

15:27.427 --> 15:30.013
Did we win, at least?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.899
Going somewhere, angel?

15:40.982 --> 15:44.152
Mac? Wh-- I-I thought
you were in jail.

15:44.235 --> 15:47.781
- Yeah, for the murder
you committed.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.282
Admit it,
you never had a daughter.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.700
You were bootlegging
with the cardinal.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.118
You killed the woman
who found you out

15:52.202 --> 15:53.328
and then you killed the cardinal

15:53.411 --> 15:54.913
so you could have
all the dough to yourself.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.581
And you decided
to frame me for it

15:56.664 --> 15:58.208
while also making me
feel very bad

15:58.291 --> 15:59.876
about my erectile dysfunction.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.629
Well, you did call yourself
"The Big Mac."

16:02.712 --> 16:05.131
But look, I didn't kill anyone.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.425
Everything I told you
was on the level.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.844
Sister Megan <i>is</i> my daughter,
and I hired you

16:09.928 --> 16:12.639
because someone slipped
your card under my door.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.474
Well, princess,
if you're so innocent,

16:14.557 --> 16:16.059
why you skipping town?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.560
Because after everything
that happened,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.145
I'm scared for my life.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.647
And I wanted to go
somewhere safe,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.566
like 1930s Poland or Belgium.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.235
Or the Sudetenland.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.737
You really think you can
pull the wool over my eyes, huh?

16:27.821 --> 16:29.864
Then explain this.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.158
It's about the pointlessness
of individual lives

16:32.242 --> 16:34.119
within the relentless
march of time.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.621
Oh. And now, explain this.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.916
A photo of you
and your business partner,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.334
the cardinal.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.545
He's not my business partner.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.006
The father is my father.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.507
What?

16:47.590 --> 16:49.050
I'm sorry I never told you.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.386
We had to keep it a secret
due to his position.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.805
But that's why when I needed
to give up my own child,

16:53.888 --> 16:55.515
I gave her to the Church.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.017
Save it for the cops, doll.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.437
You can't ballet-dance
your way out of this one.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.480
Wait, you had Charleston Chews?

17:02.564 --> 17:05.358
When we hung out, you said
you had, like, no snacks.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.697
Huh. I guess this is the sister
with her orphans.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.323
What the rumpus?

17:12.407 --> 17:15.827
Why does this one orphan
have a football-shaped head?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.912
Well, well, Detective.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.498
I guess you made my party
after all.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.916
Ms. Patbottom?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.461
My name's not Patbottom.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.588
It's Marion Lynn Flowers.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.257
Which is a very typical man's
name for this time period.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.301
Like Carol.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.387
You see, Detective,
I'm not the man, or woman,

17:34.471 --> 17:35.597
you think I am.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.224
My parents were very poor.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.268
<i>I was born in a halfway house.</i>

17:40.352 --> 17:42.812
<i>My room was
on the unfinished side.</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:46.274
<i>Ultimately, I wound up
in the church orphanage.</i>

17:46.358 --> 17:50.153
<i>The nuns were quite cruel,
especially Sister Megan.</i>

17:50.236 --> 17:53.823
<i>One morning, I was hungry,
so I asked for more.</i>

17:53.907 --> 17:55.033
More?!

17:55.116 --> 17:57.494
<i>It was, like, a huge deal.</i>

18:00.038 --> 18:03.541
<i>And the cardinal turned
a blind eye to my mistreatment.</i>

18:03.625 --> 18:06.795
<i>All he cared about was
his bootlegging operation.</i>

18:06.878 --> 18:08.838
<i>So, I called
that canine journalist</i>

18:08.922 --> 18:11.007
<i>pretending to be Sister Megan,
then I killed her</i>

18:11.091 --> 18:12.759
<i>with Mac's gun.</i>

18:14.094 --> 18:16.513
<i>I slipped Mac's card
under Hedy's door</i>

18:16.596 --> 18:17.972
<i>and I planted a roll
of film on the sister</i>

18:18.056 --> 18:20.058
<i>to lead Mac not only
to the cardinal</i>

18:20.141 --> 18:22.519
<i>but also to his new lover.</i>

18:22.602 --> 18:24.854
Fine, you didn't like
Sister Megan and the cardinal.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.816
Why me, though? Why do
all that stuff just to frame me?

18:27.899 --> 18:31.236
Because, Detective, your sin
was the greatest of all.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.654
The only way I could stomach...

18:32.737 --> 18:34.948
- Do it with pictures.
- Oh, sorry.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.450
<i>The only way I could
stomach life in the orphanage</i>

18:37.534 --> 18:42.080
<i>a dream of being a dancer.</i>

18:43.623 --> 18:45.917
<i>For years I trained,
and one day,</i>

18:46.001 --> 18:49.379
<i>I finally got my big audition
at the Quahog Ballet.</i>

18:51.965 --> 18:54.259
<i>I was the best dancer in town,
and I knew it.</i>

18:54.342 --> 18:56.636
<i>But then, tragedy struck.</i>

18:56.720 --> 18:59.389
<i>I slipped and fell,</i>

18:59.472 --> 19:01.349
<i>because someone
had pooped in the street.</i>

19:01.433 --> 19:03.810
What the literal deuce?

19:03.893 --> 19:05.520
<i>I'd broken my leg.</i>

19:05.603 --> 19:09.232
<i>After all that training, I would
never be in</i> The Nutcracker.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.568
And I got the part.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.154
Yes, the part meant for me.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.865
Everything went according
to plan except for one detail.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.492
I only came here to kill her.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.994
How did you know she'd be here?

19:21.077 --> 19:22.579
Funny thing about that.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.040
I got a friend at the harbor
who owed me one.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.671
- Thanks, pal.
- Anytime, Mac.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.715
Oh, Mac, you saved us.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.592
Yeah. Your daughter
is still dead,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.385
but you get to continue
to outlive her,

19:37.469 --> 19:39.220
which is every mom's dream.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.972
Oh, just shut up and kiss me.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.974
You got it, sweetheart.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.559
Mmm.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.978
<i>It was the start
of a beautiful romance.</i>

19:47.062 --> 19:49.981
<i>Soon, we'd be engaged,
and we invited all our friends</i>

19:50.065 --> 19:51.941
<i>to the wedding in Hawaii.</i>

19:52.025 --> 19:57.197
"Please join Mac and Hedy in
Hawaii on December 7th, 1941,

19:57.280 --> 19:59.741
"a date that will
live in intimacy.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.451
And on Friday,
please join us for..."

20:01.534 --> 20:02.952
It's a whole weekend?

20:10.752 --> 20:12.962
Sorry for not
believing you, Mac.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.674
But thanks to you, the real
murderer is behind bars.

20:15.757 --> 20:19.427
And the Greater Boston area
has seen its last bad priest.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.304
So, what's gonna happen
to Marion?

20:21.388 --> 20:24.974
Well, he's a lunatic murderer
who cross-dresses in the '30s.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.976
My guess is he can
look forward to a life

20:27.060 --> 20:31.231
of loony bin craft projects
and staring out at the sea.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.235
You think that place
can hold me?

20:35.318 --> 20:38.029
You're dead, copper.
You're all dead.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.614

20:48.581 --> 20:52.210
<i>I'm Mac Bookpro, and I can
skip a rock six times.</i>

20:53.712 --> 20:55.005
<i>That wasn't a good rock.</i>
