God, the Clam sucks on Saturday mornings.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.876
It's all just weird foreign sports fans,

00:42.959 --> 00:45.712
like those Pakistani cricket hooligans.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.380
If you are not rooting for Lahore,

00:47.464 --> 00:49.257
please you may leave, I can tell you!

00:49.341 --> 00:51.217
Lahore cricketers are the best,

00:51.301 --> 00:54.012
and the others are not the best,
dear friends.

00:54.095 --> 00:58.224
I'm for Karachi,
but I don't got a death wish about it.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.018
Guys, what's wrong with us?

01:00.101 --> 01:02.395
It's Saturday morning,
and we're drinking in a bar.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.981
We should be drinking
at the Goodwill donation dumpster.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.984
-Why come?
-'Cause right now's when
all the yard sales end.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.403
We can get first pick
of the abandoned leftovers.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.030
That's a stupid idea.
There's not gonna

01:12.113 --> 01:14.032
be anything good in that dumpster.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.993
PETER: What if I told you
everything I'm wearing right now

01:17.077 --> 01:18.453
I found in that dumpster?

01:18.536 --> 01:21.289
Is that a bachelorette sash?

01:21.373 --> 01:25.418
Scott said I could do hand stuff
this weekend, but that's it.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.423
I told you this is stupid.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.883
There's nothing good in here.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.551
Hey, look-- a pair of working legs.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.011
Dibs on these.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.138
Wha...? Aw, come on, Quagmire!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.765
Joe, I said dibs.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.226
No, no, you're right.
You said dibs.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.978
Whoa. Check it out.
A Sorry! board game.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.438
Let me see it.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.023
(soft rattling)

01:47.107 --> 01:49.234
-Three pieces missing.
-How'd you do that?

01:49.317 --> 01:52.612
I can shake anything
and figure out what all's in there.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.784
You got 11 periods left.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.245
Cool. VHS of Eraserhead.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.248
This'll be good for when
I never want to sleep again.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.042
Holy crap.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.460
Wha-What? What is it?

02:10.422 --> 02:11.923
A Magic 8 Ball!

02:12.007 --> 02:13.842
This thing can tell the future.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.052
No, it can't, Peter.
It's just a stupid toy.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
I don't know. Let's test it.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.765
Will there be snow this Christmas?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.476
(gasps)
Oh, my God, the ball is right.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.061
I should ask again later.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.604
How did it know that?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.690
Guys, from now on, I am living my life

02:28.773 --> 02:30.734
according to the Magic 8 Ball.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.485
It will lead me like the shorebird

02:32.569 --> 02:35.155
that led the first Pilgrims to Boston.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.783
Ahoy!
Are you looking to build a city

02:38.867 --> 02:41.745
where sports fans
can be notoriously racist?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
Yeah, and can we also ruin
"Sweet Caroline"

02:44.080 --> 02:46.541
-for everyone else?
-Absolutely.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.878
Can our airport security people
be responsible for 9/11?

02:49.961 --> 02:53.465
And can our own 9/11 be, like,
one one-thousandth as bad,

02:53.548 --> 02:55.675
but we'll still make
a fricking movie about it?

02:55.759 --> 02:57.427
I think I know just the place.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.055
Okay, I don't know
if this is gonna be a problem,

03:00.138 --> 03:02.098
but we forgot to bring the letter "R."

03:02.182 --> 03:03.725
No problem at all.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.144
Right this way, large-faced whites!

03:06.227 --> 03:08.104
ALL (chanting):
Let's go, Red Sox!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.522
(rhythmic clapping)

03:09.606 --> 03:12.025
Let's go, Red Sox!

03:17.072 --> 03:18.531
What is that?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.075
It's my Magic 8 Ball.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.659
This is the first black ball

03:21.743 --> 03:23.995
that Kim Kardashian hasn't played with.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.790
Why is it filled with the blue
liquid from tampon commercials?

03:26.873 --> 03:28.375
That's a very gross question, Meg.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.460
You may take your breakfast in the attic.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.131
That question aside,
I'm having a blast with my new 8 Ball.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.549
It knows everything. Watch.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.301
Magic 8 Ball,

03:38.385 --> 03:41.554
will my middle-of-the-highway
puppet show be a success?

03:42.972 --> 03:44.974
Well, I'll show this thing.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.770
(truck horn blaring)

03:48.853 --> 03:50.230
-(tires screeching)
-(thud)

03:52.899 --> 03:54.442
How'd it go, Dad?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.444
I don't know, Sparky.
What did you think?

03:56.528 --> 03:59.197
The performance was a little flat.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.908
(instrumental Family Guy theme plays)

04:14.254 --> 04:16.589
Magic 8 Ball.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.383
Magic 8 Ball, I'm bored.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.593
Should I sniff my coworker's hair?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.181
He told me to do it!

04:25.265 --> 04:27.267
Mr. Griffin, if a Magic 8 Ball asked you

04:27.350 --> 04:29.602
to jump off a building,
would you do that, too?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.021
Did it?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.398
No, I'm just using that
as an example of...

04:33.481 --> 04:35.650
I listened to the toy!

04:39.154 --> 04:42.532
Magic 8 Ball,
what's the best e-mail provider?

04:44.075 --> 04:46.244
"Outlook good."
Interesting.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.705
He's not raving about it,
but it's a solid choice.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.707
Let's go, Peter.
Time for church.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.085
Mom said they're gonna serve
Chewy Chips Ahoy at coffee hour.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.628
Lois... church?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.630
Who am I supposed to worship-- Jesus?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.466
This is my god now.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.009
Watch your mouth, Peter.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.803
Sorry, Lois, but my religion
is now the 8 Ball.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.931
Magic 8 Ball,
is the Fox network sustainable

05:07.015 --> 05:09.017
in this new streaming world?

05:10.018 --> 05:12.979
No. No!

05:13.063 --> 05:14.481
(gasps)

05:14.564 --> 05:16.066
Kim, what's wrong?

05:16.149 --> 05:19.486
A black ball went to waste.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.245
Are you streaming Mindhunter in church?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.165
I'm trying to stream Mindhunter in church.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.796
Freaking guest Wi-Fi.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.465
You know the priest gets the good Wi-Fi.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.133
And yea, the Lord said...

05:42.217 --> 05:44.010
Whoa, whoa.
Mindhunter's going in.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.679
I mean... (clears throat)

05:45.762 --> 05:48.306
Thou art the children
of Abraham, and thou shalt...

05:48.390 --> 05:49.891
He's playing you!

05:49.974 --> 05:52.060
You think you're playing him?
He's playing you.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.104
I hate this.
When do I get my cookie?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.356
I just want my cookie so I can go home.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.483
Now please join me in silent prayer.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.402
And as we settle into the silence,

06:00.485 --> 06:02.696
I remind you that-- in honor of Lent--

06:02.779 --> 06:07.200
today's coffee service
will not include Chewy Chips Ahoy.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.124
-(bleep)
-(all gasping)

06:14.207 --> 06:16.209
-(Lois gasps)
-(congregation murmurs)

06:18.211 --> 06:20.714
Hey, Stewie said his first word.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.841
And it was a swear.

06:22.924 --> 06:25.010
Well, this is unacceptable.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.721
We have to leave right now
and go straight to breakfast.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.806
Unbelievable.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.475
(car door opens, closes)

06:32.559 --> 06:34.602
(engine starts)

06:34.686 --> 06:36.688
Let's go!

06:42.777 --> 06:45.613
I can't believe Stewie
finally said his first word

06:45.697 --> 06:47.949
and it ends up being... that.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.036
Right now, every woman
in my mommy wine group is judging me.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.955
I may have to start drinking wine
at home alone.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.083
-Start?
-Not the day for it, Chris! Not the day!

06:57.167 --> 06:59.294
I don't get it, Stewie.
You've been talking forever.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.962
Why did everyone
suddenly understand you now?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.630
I don't know.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.966
I was feeling so much
intense emotion in the moment,

07:05.050 --> 07:07.260
and that one word somehow
just burst through.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.512
Yeah, but now what?
Everyone can understand you?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.222
I don't think so.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.892
Not unless I'm yelling something
I feel strongly about.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.895
Greta Gerwig is a national treasure!

07:16.978 --> 07:18.563
See? Nothing.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.482
I guess I'm not feeling it.
I don't know.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.443
What if that's the only thing
I'll ever be able to express?

07:23.526 --> 07:26.196
Anger.
What kind of a person would I be then?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.906
Larry David, Lewis Black,

07:27.989 --> 07:30.158
a Trump voter, everyone on Twitter.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.202
But I don't want
to be any of those things.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.578
They've got to hear me.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.497
Ice cream! Lollipop!

07:35.580 --> 07:36.915
Bubbles! Kitty cat!

07:36.998 --> 07:38.333
(Curb Your Enthusiasm theme plays)

07:38.416 --> 07:40.335
Doggy! Raincoat! Preschool!

07:40.418 --> 07:44.339
Fire truck! Goldfish!
Finger paint!

07:44.422 --> 07:47.717
(soft chatter, laughter)

07:48.760 --> 07:50.261
Lois, what are you doing here?

07:50.345 --> 07:52.389
What do you mean?
You invited us.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.225
Sorry, but we can't have Stewie here.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.851
I brought my own veggie burgers,

07:56.935 --> 07:58.478
but I'm not gonna
make a big deal about it.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.772
What with his profanity and all,
I don't think

08:00.855 --> 08:03.274
Stewie would be a good influence
on the other children.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.110
Is there a designated spot on the grill

08:05.193 --> 08:06.486
for the veggie burgers?

08:06.569 --> 08:07.987
And again, not a big deal.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.073
You're saying that
because of a swear word,

08:10.156 --> 08:12.826
my son isn't good enough
for your pool party?

08:12.909 --> 08:14.661
It's a little bit about him swearing,

08:14.744 --> 08:16.955
but mostly about you as a parent.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.333
Kevin, I said, no arrows!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.127
KEVIN:
Crossbows don't shoot arrows.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.920
They shoot bolts, dumbass!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.964
(chuckles)
Okay, sweetie.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.384
KEVIN:
Hey, Dad, did you hear
what Einstein called bolts?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.011
JOE:
I heard it.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.099
Brian, shut off the television.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.809
It's ruined my baby!

08:37.892 --> 08:39.227
What are you talking about?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.771
Stewie obviously learned
to swear from some TV show.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.482
No, he didn't.
The only show he watches is Caillou.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.609
Well, then that little
French-Canadian weirdo

08:46.693 --> 08:48.695
is the potty mouth, I'm sure of it.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.489
And I'm willing to watch every
single episode just to prove it.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.408
NARRATOR:
Caillou was upset.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.911
Why am I bald?
I'm not a baby. I'm four.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.456
Are kids just bald in Canada?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.999
NARRATOR: So Caillou decided

09:01.082 --> 09:02.542
to look himself up on Wikipedia.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.586
God, this is dull.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.838
CAILLOU: Maybe I'm supposed
to be a cancer survivor,

09:06.921 --> 09:09.341
and this show is very inspiring.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.843
NARRATOR:
But Caillou wasn't a cancer survivor.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.305
The show's creators
just made a weird choice.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.849
Caillou's low-testosterone father

09:17.932 --> 09:20.352
again indulged Caillou's tantrum,

09:20.435 --> 09:22.687
clearly trying to raise a sociopath.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.272
CAILLOU'S FATHER:
It's okay, Caillou.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.232
I'll bake you a pie.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.818
NARRATOR:
He said, his body flooding with estrogen.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.236
Lois?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.696
Are you dead?

09:31.780 --> 09:33.114
(sniffing)

09:33.198 --> 09:34.741
Can I eat you?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.868
-Huh? What?
-Ah, another time.

09:36.951 --> 09:41.081
Oh. I-I, um... I watched
that Caillou, and you're right.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.416
Stewie didn't learn that word
from Caillou.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.502
That means he learned it
from someone in this house.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.879
-Okay.
-And I will find out who.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.506
I'm gonna set a trap

09:49.589 --> 09:52.050
and lure the swearer
into revealing himself.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.468
That sounds hard.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.096
Oh, I will find the swearer.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.472
CAILLOU:
Dad, why are we sitting

09:57.555 --> 09:58.973
on the washing machine?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.392
CAILLOU'S FATHER:
Because in Canada,

10:00.475 --> 10:02.435
men have vaginas.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.025
Hey, what's with the stairs?
Why do they look different?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.485
Oh, I'm trying to prove

10:10.568 --> 10:12.612
that Peter's the one cussing in the house,

10:12.696 --> 10:15.365
so I waxed the staircase

Hey, Lois, have you seen
my Spider-Man socks?

with Caillou's beta dad.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.133
In fact, I'm meeting him at the park

10:33.216 --> 10:35.719
to eat unsalted saltines on the swings.

10:36.761 --> 10:37.887

or feed you guys

you should go, for sure.

Uh, I don't know what that was,
