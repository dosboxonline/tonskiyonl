WEBVTT

00:20.759 --> 00:23.936
You're gonna
get in trouble, man.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.851
Then move to France.

00:25.851 --> 00:29.029
The French, buddy? No.
You're, like...

00:29.029 --> 00:30.639
The French would like me
better than you.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.771
Well, no, I-I don't think...

00:39.996 --> 00:42.303
Now, I know there's at least
one dancer in there

00:42.303 --> 00:44.348
that's got a restraining order
against you, Vivian.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.002
Five hundred feet.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.310
That's not-- W-- Y-You got
old information, Sheriff.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.486
Candy moved down to Sioux Falls
last month

00:51.486 --> 00:53.140
- to take care of her mother.
- Oh, so now

00:53.140 --> 00:55.577
you're keeping tabs
on the poor girl, huh?

00:56.969 --> 00:59.102
Judge won't gonna like that.
Not at all.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.890
You two kids get home safe, huh?

01:07.632 --> 01:09.504
See you at the Elks on Thursday.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.946
You got my check, right?

01:16.946 --> 01:19.340
The re-election fund?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.298
Had... had my girl

01:21.298 --> 01:23.126
make it out personally
last week.

01:23.126 --> 01:26.303
What... what the fuck, Roy?

01:26.303 --> 01:27.870
- Hm?
- What...

01:29.219 --> 01:31.787
You can't do this shit
anymore, Roy.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.268
I-I know the governor now.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.883
See, now, what happens
in moments of life and death

01:40.883 --> 01:42.972
is that everything
comes into focus.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.410
Are you focused, Vivian?

01:47.455 --> 01:48.934
Y-yeah, yeah.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.111
You're not gonna
sell your bank to that woman.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.852
L-Lyon?

01:53.852 --> 01:56.290
Th-Th-That's the one.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.683
You're not gonna sell it,
you're not gonna negotiate,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.337
you're not even gonna
return her calls.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.470
W-Why?

02:02.470 --> 02:04.689
Wait, wait, wait!

02:04.689 --> 02:06.082
O-Okay.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.867
Find some other way to get rich.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.869
Foreclose on some homes,

02:10.869 --> 02:13.176
sell raffle tickets.
I don't care.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.439
But that woman gets nothing.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.615
We're clear?

02:17.615 --> 02:19.051
Yeah.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.881
Now why don't you
do a little dance?

02:24.187 --> 02:25.580
What?

02:28.583 --> 02:29.975
I'm just kidding.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.629
Nobody wants to see that.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.577
<i>We've been patient.</i>

03:08.666 --> 03:10.146
<i>More than patient.</i>

03:12.496 --> 03:14.629
<i>But if we can't
settle this thing today,</i>

03:14.629 --> 03:18.415
<i>my next call is to
our litigation department.</i>

03:18.415 --> 03:20.896
<i>Thank you, and please
make sure to give this call</i>

03:20.896 --> 03:22.985
<i>five stars on the next survey.</i>

03:48.967 --> 03:51.535
Looks like you found the cereal.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.276
Frosted Flakes.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.409
Your kid likes 'em?

03:55.409 --> 03:57.019
Well, kinda.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.630
My husband.
He can't get enough.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.677
Are you taking me to school?

04:02.677 --> 04:04.679
No school today.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.071
Is it a holiday?

04:07.116 --> 04:08.857
In a way.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.207
But I got to go to work, so...

04:13.688 --> 04:16.038
Slept in the garage again?

04:19.694 --> 04:21.217
You don't have to open the door.

04:23.088 --> 04:26.266
School bus saw me in my drawers.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.747
Plus, it's freezing out.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.271
Scotty, hon, could you

04:31.271 --> 04:32.315
take your book
to the living room, please?

04:32.315 --> 04:34.665
Want me to clear my bowl?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.058
Please.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.807
I need you to watch her today.
It's just for a few hours.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.635
- I want a wife.
- Maybe you could take her
to the park or what--

04:47.635 --> 04:49.724
Wait, what did you say?

04:51.421 --> 04:52.944
I said I want a wife.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.947
I am your wife.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.080
No.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.995
A wife.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.346
Someone to keep the house clean
and-and cook.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.566
I cook.

05:05.566 --> 05:09.744
Who cooks good, you know?

05:09.744 --> 05:13.138
Takes care of me when I'm sick
and doesn't complain about it.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.010
Who wants to know
how my day was first

05:15.010 --> 05:16.794
and listens to the answer.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.188
A woman who supports me.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.842
Oh...

05:20.842 --> 05:22.322
I support you.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.193
No, emotionally, I'm saying.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.500
A wife who...

05:26.500 --> 05:29.329
who builds my confidence,

05:29.329 --> 05:33.289
who everything
revolves around... me.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.117
Not... And I know-I know
what you do

05:35.117 --> 05:37.075
is important, I do, but...

05:38.076 --> 05:40.383
I'm important, too, you know?

05:40.383 --> 05:43.343
My needs, so I can grow

05:43.343 --> 05:44.996
and be the best.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.607
Okay?

05:47.825 --> 05:50.437
A cheerleader, is what I'm...

05:50.437 --> 05:54.179
You know, a wife
who comes to the club

05:54.179 --> 05:56.530
for the socials and doesn't

05:56.530 --> 05:59.141
talk about what's a felony
or what's a misdemeanor,

05:59.141 --> 06:01.143
but trades recipes,

06:01.143 --> 06:03.319
right?
With the other wives.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.148
Who claps when I win

06:06.148 --> 06:08.324
and rubs my back when I don't,

06:08.324 --> 06:10.021
and says,
"You'll get 'em next time

06:10.021 --> 06:12.720
because you are amazing."

06:20.728 --> 06:22.469
Is that all?

06:24.993 --> 06:27.387
No.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.390
I want a wife who takes care
of my other needs--

06:30.390 --> 06:32.174
my man needs--

06:32.174 --> 06:34.219
when I feel like it,

06:34.219 --> 06:37.222
and doesn't say she's tired
or that her back hurts

06:37.222 --> 06:38.833
or to pull out when I finish

06:38.833 --> 06:40.487
'cause she's not on the pill.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.532
Which-- I want a wife
who's on the pill.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.405
I can't take the pill.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.623
I get blood clots.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.277
Well, an IUD then.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.630
Okay, look, look.
the-the point is I am tired

06:53.630 --> 06:56.198
of feeling like I got to be
everything around here

06:56.198 --> 06:57.460
all the time.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.114
The man and the wife.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.987
Like, I got to support you
all the time, your needs,

07:02.987 --> 07:05.207
'cause your job is hard
and you're always saying

07:05.207 --> 07:06.774
you have to pick up
extra shifts.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.735
We are $192,000

07:11.735 --> 07:13.868
in debt.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.696
And that.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.089
A wife who is not

07:18.089 --> 07:21.136
reminding me all the time
about negative...

07:21.136 --> 07:22.746
negativity, you know?

07:22.746 --> 07:24.574
Pressure, when I-I need
to stay positive,

07:24.574 --> 07:26.228
'cause it's
a mental game, right?

07:26.228 --> 07:27.838
How far you hit a drive,
whether you're in the sand trap,

07:27.838 --> 07:29.318
and you just...

07:29.318 --> 07:32.713
suck.
You suck at that.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.890
So I want a wife.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.852
I'm late for work.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.986
We can talk about

07:44.986 --> 07:48.032
who really needs a wife later.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.603
Scotty, hon.
I got to go out.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.953
I'll be back as soon as I can.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.302
Okay, then.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.390
What am I supposed
to do with her?

07:58.390 --> 08:00.044
I got physical therapy

08:00.044 --> 08:01.872
and I'm supposed to walk
the green at 2:00, my guru says,

08:01.872 --> 08:03.352
so I can play it
with my eyes shut.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.485
You're a big boy.
Figure it out.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.561
Please, ple--

08:45.916 --> 08:47.352
Say it.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.180
I'm gonna call Dot
and tell her to come.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.879
Who the fuck is Dot?

08:51.879 --> 08:54.446
Listen, wait, wait!
Listen.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.491
Listen.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.884
I got cancer.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.233
I need an operation.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.843
You got the wrong guy.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.628
You got...

09:01.628 --> 09:03.978
Fuck.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.853
Fuck you, you fucking
piece of shit.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.159
Fuck you!

09:13.901 --> 09:16.947
<i>...on my phone call, but they
never thought I'd release it,</i>

09:16.947 --> 09:18.558
<i>so they were gonna be okay.</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:22.213
<i>Eight times,</i> quid pro quo.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.215
<i>Except it was no times.</i>

09:24.215 --> 09:27.784
Mm. They are doing it
for real this time.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.481
Jackals.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.529
Impeaching that great man.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.965
Now, not too short
above the ears.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.532
I got the debate coming up.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.404
Gets my goat,

09:39.404 --> 09:41.885
they're hounding that poor man
day and night.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.539
The twins think so, too.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.410
We want to watch cartoons.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.847
Hey.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.762
Don't talk back to your mother.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.593
<i>Down at Wayne Lyon Kia,</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
<i>we got
the lowest prices in town,</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:57.553
<i>and I ain't lyin'.</i>

09:57.553 --> 09:59.947
<i>Hi, I'm Wayne Lyon
at Lyon Motors.</i>

09:59.947 --> 10:01.383
<i>And I want to get you
behind the wheel of a new...</i>

10:01.383 --> 10:03.472
Aah!

10:03.472 --> 10:05.082
- Oh, Roy. Honey...
- Shit, woman.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.389
I am so sorry.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.695
- God.
- I don't know what happened.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.087
Hold on, let me just...

10:11.175 --> 10:12.699
These are my mother's napkins.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.352
What happened, Karen,
is you got

10:14.352 --> 10:16.964
all caught up in things
that don't concern you

10:16.964 --> 10:18.661
and you lost sight
of the job at hand.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.143
- You're right.
- Now, it's 10:00 in the morning.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.971
I think these girls
have something better to do

10:23.971 --> 10:26.713
than sit here, watch TV
like a couple of welfare queens.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.280
Girls, come on.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.891
Come on, your daddy's right.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.240
It's time to get
to your lessons.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.807
Ah, dang it.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.336
Thought you were that
crazy Swede for a second.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.122
On account of he's
missing half an ear.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.820
Very funny.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.955
Got Nadine's husband
in the box when you're ready.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.522
I'm Nadine's husband.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.221
Sure. Uh...

10:57.221 --> 10:58.962
uh, what I meant was, uh,

10:58.962 --> 11:01.661
the car salesman's
in the abattoir, ready to talk.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.923
Did you soften him up
a little bit?

11:02.923 --> 11:04.011
Oh, he's still
got all his teeth,

11:04.011 --> 11:05.621
if that's what you're asking,

11:05.621 --> 11:08.189
but only 'cause
they're in there pretty good.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.843
Crying like a little girl?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.583
He's pissed, I'll tell you that.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.021
Called me a few names I ain't
heard since grade school.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.764
Swears we got the wrong guy,
which is, like,

11:17.764 --> 11:19.330
nice try, asshole.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.505
Thought you said he was soft.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.681
Well, he had a pretty good shock

11:21.681 --> 11:23.465
at the house, you know.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.336
Finger in the old light socket.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.816
Sometimes that
scrambles the brain.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.992
You hear those stories, right?

11:28.992 --> 11:30.864
"My husband
ain't the man I married

11:30.864 --> 11:32.300
since the lightning struck."

11:37.000 --> 11:38.088
What?

11:49.360 --> 11:52.842
We've been wearing
kerchiefs on our faces

11:52.842 --> 11:54.670
so he don't recognize us later.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.114
...don't you understand?
I don't know

12:04.114 --> 12:05.507
what the fuck
you're talking about.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.204
Oh, who's this, then?

12:07.204 --> 12:09.119
Oh, king of
the idiot brigade, eh?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.860
Let me tell you

12:10.860 --> 12:12.775
what I told
these other two morons.

12:12.775 --> 12:16.387
You kidnapped the wrong chump.
I got friends in high places,

12:16.387 --> 12:18.476
and when they
get through with you,

12:18.476 --> 12:20.043
you're gonna wish you were
the horse at a glue factory,

12:20.043 --> 12:21.871
you...

12:21.871 --> 12:23.264
Jesus!

12:34.623 --> 12:36.625
What the hot fuck, Dad?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.714
I thought this one
was supposed to stay in the car.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.020
Yeah.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.848
So you're a leptard, too.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.327
How are we supposed
to get her back now?

12:43.327 --> 12:46.113
- You killed our leverage.
- That's not him, genius.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.855
You grabbed the wrong patsy.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.335
What? No.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.386
I was in the car.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.170
That's his fuck up.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.608
He was in the room, this guy.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.741
Name was on the door.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.265
- Don't know what else
I could've done.
- See?

13:08.265 --> 13:11.268
I thought you said
you saw the car salesman

13:11.268 --> 13:13.488
- in his house on Halloween.
- Yeah.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.316
Said you got a good look at him.

13:21.626 --> 13:22.976
It was dark, okay?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.630
And on fire, and... I...

13:26.544 --> 13:27.763
He grabbed him.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.635
Said we got the guy.
It's the...

13:30.635 --> 13:33.203
What do you...
Power of suggestion.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.563
So what do we do now?

13:47.130 --> 13:50.264
Son, you got a bad-luck problem.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.353
Somewhere out there,
there's an upside down horseshoe

13:52.353 --> 13:53.484
with your name on it.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.095
I'm just off my game is all.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.707
You know I'm a winner.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.274
All-state quarterback,
crack shot,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.102
knocking all the pins down
with my eyes closed.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
That's your boy,

14:03.886 --> 14:05.845
not this puke pile.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.022
All right, I think I know
where you got

14:09.022 --> 14:11.328
that thorn in your paw.
Get the car.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.808
Where we going?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.636
To pay the boogeyman.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.385
And you're saying
that the patient had a sur--

14:24.385 --> 14:26.126
Mr. Seymour.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.736
You're saying he had surgery
scheduled this morning,

14:27.736 --> 14:28.998
but he checked himself out.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.478
No, they took him.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.871
Who?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.177
Two men.
They said they were family.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.439
That happens, right?

14:35.439 --> 14:36.832
Patient gets cold feet.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.790
Yeah, except his wife
is hysterical

14:38.790 --> 14:40.618
and nobody's seen him since.

14:52.413 --> 14:55.416
And on the same day,
those two FBI fellas showed up.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.766
- FBI?
- Oh, yeah. They were
looking for that

14:57.766 --> 15:00.682
mental patient female,
the runaway.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.989
They're down in the cafeteria
right now, talking to Mr. Lyon.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.426
<i>Well, like I said,</i>

15:05.426 --> 15:06.862
we just want
to talk to your wife,

15:06.862 --> 15:08.559
make sure she's okay.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.736
Are you gentlemen quite certain

15:11.736 --> 15:13.434
I can't offer you a gimlet?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.827
Uh, no, thanks.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.656
She gave us the slip,

15:18.656 --> 15:20.615
but we think she's running
from someone else.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.315
I'm sorry, I had a...

15:26.360 --> 15:28.971
I'm-I'm a little
sideways, still.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.886
I...

15:30.886 --> 15:32.583
Faulty wiring.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.977
I-I think my house burned down.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.414
And we have questions
about that.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.114
The night in question.
What you remember.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.898
Neighbors said they saw
a couple of trick-or-treaters

15:42.898 --> 15:45.248
fleeing the premises
after the flames started.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.946
That...

15:46.946 --> 15:49.600
Fleeing?
I-I don't...

15:54.431 --> 15:57.652
You ever see
that movie, <i>The,</i> um...

15:59.045 --> 16:01.134
<i>...Nightmare Before Christmas?</i>

16:02.135 --> 16:04.702
That-that's a weird movie.

16:04.702 --> 16:08.097
I want to say
I-I dreamed it, but in...

16:08.097 --> 16:09.794
real life.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.625
Well, sir, there's no
easy way to say this.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.714
Um...

16:16.714 --> 16:18.716
Your wife
isn't who she says she is.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.023
Dorothy Lyon-- uh,

16:21.023 --> 16:23.069
that's what we call an alias
in our line of work.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.200
A cover story.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.247
Her real name is Nadine Bump.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.208
- Nadine?
- When he was a boy,

16:32.208 --> 16:35.690
my son wanted to be a ballerina.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.257
I told him...

16:37.257 --> 16:39.650
the male of the species

16:39.650 --> 16:41.522
is called a "ballerino,"

16:41.522 --> 16:44.742
but he couldn't be swayed.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.701
What do you mean
she's not my wife?

16:46.701 --> 16:48.485
Uh, no, no.

16:48.485 --> 16:52.228
- She's your wife.
- But also, she isn't.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.143
- I'm sorry?
- See, she was

16:54.143 --> 16:55.710
married previously.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.799
Still married, some would say.
Under the law.

16:57.799 --> 17:01.107
To a-another man.
A bad man.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.195
So she ran away from him.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.457
And found her way to you.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.372
Posing as Dorothy.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.591
Posing?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.028
It's a classic scam.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.986
You find a gravestone
in a cemetery,

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
somebody who died young and
you take over their identity,

17:13.075 --> 17:16.296
uh, Social Security number, etcetera.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.254
We think this fella--

17:18.254 --> 17:21.953
the original, maybe also
simultaneous husband--

17:21.953 --> 17:24.260
found her and came after her.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.175
Your wife.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.699
That he took her
that first night last week.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.005
Okay?
And then, when she escaped,

17:30.005 --> 17:31.789
he came back for her
on Halloween,

17:31.789 --> 17:35.663
maybe burning your house down
in the process.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.404
And now she's fled.

17:37.404 --> 17:41.103
So, we're hoping you might
have some insight

17:41.103 --> 17:43.801
- as to possible destination.
- Excuse me.

17:43.801 --> 17:47.022
Indira Olmstead, Scandia PD.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.155
You've probably got a dozen
messages for me on your machine.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.505
We're right in the middle
of an interview, officer.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.856
On my case.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.771
And believe me,
you're gonna want to hear

17:56.771 --> 17:57.946
what I've got
to say on the matter.

17:57.946 --> 18:01.558
Have-have you seen my wife?

18:01.558 --> 18:03.647
She was supposed
to visit me today.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.045
No, sir.

18:10.045 --> 18:13.048
But I'm sure she's fine.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.876
And your daughter.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.009
My Scotty plays the drums.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.925
Rommel used the sound of drums

18:20.925 --> 18:22.884
to drive his enemy mad.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.802
We're done here.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.021
Mr. Lyon, Mr. Lyon.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.936
Uh, we'll-we'll circle back.

18:31.936 --> 18:34.200
- Officer.
- Thank you so much.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.333
Okay.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.815
Ballerino.

18:53.436 --> 18:56.787
Hyah!

18:56.787 --> 18:59.050
Dad, come on.
You're not paying this guy.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.446
Fine.
We're upside down. And...

19:03.446 --> 19:06.841
maybe it's voodoo
or whatever, but...

19:06.841 --> 19:09.148
...solve it
with a bullet, not...

19:10.453 --> 19:12.151
Otherwise, what?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.110
We trust this guy?

19:17.808 --> 19:19.332
<i>"Here's your money,
please lift the curse"?</i>

19:19.332 --> 19:21.290
<i>I don't think so.</i>

19:21.290 --> 19:23.553
We tried killing him.

19:23.553 --> 19:27.209
Now we're bailing water
out of a sinking boat.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.950
<i>Election's a week away
and we're still</i>

19:28.950 --> 19:31.735
<i>balls-deep on righting
old wrongs with Nadine,</i>

19:31.735 --> 19:33.302
<i>our dicks in the breeze.</i>

19:35.739 --> 19:37.567
We need to take luck
out of the equation.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.048
Period.
End of story.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.407
Go on, search him,
then wait in the car.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.411
Come on, come on.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.848
Let's go.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.338
Let me see your hands.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.965
It's not a win.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.404
We're calling a draw.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.017
So don't get cocky.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.818
I'm in the market for a bull.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.169
There's a science to it,
they tell me,

20:58.169 --> 21:01.347
but I prefer to go on instinct.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.827
Worked for my father
and his father before him.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.266
We have business.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.138
Christ, look at the cock
on that monster.

21:11.095 --> 21:14.098
Meat is meat.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.058
You don't talk much.
I like that.

21:18.755 --> 21:22.629
A man has only so many words
in his lifetime.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.285
For us,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.896
there are very few left.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.819
Plus interest,
'cause we got sideways.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.255
Now, I didn't make your deal

21:40.255 --> 21:42.257
but if I had
I would've been clear.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.955
That woman's like a tick.

21:46.217 --> 21:49.133
Can't crush her,
can't pull her out clean.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.701
Suffocation is the key.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.661
Or fire.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.967
If I had a nickel for every time
she found the daylight

21:56.967 --> 21:59.056
when I thought
I had her buried...

22:01.276 --> 22:02.756
Never had a problem before

22:02.756 --> 22:04.801
or since, breaking a woman,
but that one,

22:04.801 --> 22:08.109
she's...
What'd you call her?

22:09.153 --> 22:10.938
A tiger.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.505
Right.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.029
You think you're hunting her
but all the while

22:15.029 --> 22:17.336
you're just a mouse and
she's playing with her supper.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.429
Probably ought
to let her be, but...

22:38.487 --> 22:41.403
When a man digs a grave,

22:41.403 --> 22:43.318
he has to fill it.

22:44.537 --> 22:47.844
Otherwise, it's just a hole.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.098
Happy now, shitbird?

23:24.098 --> 23:25.752
You got your money?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.190
People are dead.
Good men.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.148
And you're still
wandering the earth,

23:31.148 --> 23:33.281
breathing the air
they should be breathing.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.727
A boy complains

23:44.727 --> 23:47.643
because he thinks
the world is unfair.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.602
He cries to his mother

23:49.602 --> 23:52.866
when the toy breaks
or the knee is skinned.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.390
Fuck that. You're the one
who's gonna be crying.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.050
A man knows better.

24:04.312 --> 24:07.533
The things that happen happen.

24:07.533 --> 24:11.058
Who lives, who dies.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.757
You don't yell at the boulder
for being a rock.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.244
You want the last word?
Here it is.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.638
I'll see you soon, asshole.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.157
His name is Roy Tillman.

25:07.157 --> 25:10.247
He's the sheriff
of Stark County, North Dakota.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.034
Dorothy Lyon was his wife.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.992
She disappeared 11 years ago.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.820
Until now, it was presumed dead.

25:20.214 --> 25:22.869
I saw him.

25:22.869 --> 25:23.870
Yesterday.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.785
At the Lyon Estate.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.482
What was he doing there?

25:29.005 --> 25:31.268
Looking for his wife,
I'm guessing.

25:33.488 --> 25:36.404
He's a real "I am the law" type,

25:36.404 --> 25:39.015
- her husband.
- Except his version of the law
is spending

25:39.015 --> 25:41.235
a million dollars
on tactical gear

25:41.235 --> 25:43.846
and weapons
on the taxpayer's dollar,

25:43.846 --> 25:46.980
and then gifting them
to a right-wing militia.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.590
Run by Roy's father-in-law.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.765
Current father-in-law.

25:52.681 --> 25:55.205
But how's Dorothy
gonna help you with that?

25:55.205 --> 25:57.904
She hasn't been
Mrs. Tillman in ten years.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.862
He runs a tight ship,
the sheriff.

25:59.862 --> 26:00.907
Nobody talks.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.386
People disappear. Nadine...

26:02.386 --> 26:04.040
- Mrs. Lyon.
- She knows all the players,

26:04.040 --> 26:06.782
maybe even where
the bodies are buried.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.655
We use her to flip them.

26:11.395 --> 26:14.573
The son or the ranch foreman.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.971
Do you know where she is?

26:23.930 --> 26:25.409
I do not.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.329
What about the abuse?

26:32.329 --> 26:35.550
The fact that
he used to beat her?

26:35.550 --> 26:37.639
Or the current crimes,
kidnapping attempts?

26:39.119 --> 26:43.079
Conspiracy to kill
a North Dakota state trooper.

26:43.079 --> 26:45.604
Or, I mean, this bystander
they grabbed up yesterday.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.996
Probably took him
back to the ranch,

26:46.996 --> 26:48.258
thinking he's Wayne.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.173
I say that we

26:50.173 --> 26:53.176
get a warrant
and go there today. Now.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.438
God knows what
they're gonna do with him

26:54.438 --> 26:55.439
when they realize he's a fake.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.267
And if he's not there?

26:57.267 --> 27:01.184
Then we showed our hand,
he closes ranks, Mister...

27:01.184 --> 27:03.056
Seymour.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.753
Ends up thrown off a cliff
somewhere in Wyoming,

27:04.753 --> 27:06.276
never to be seen again.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.800
Yeah.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.892
If you see her.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.458
I'll call.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.158
That's how this works, right?

27:18.158 --> 27:21.552
You help me.
I help you.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.946
And we all help Dorothy.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.557
You know... the victim.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.526
Shit.

27:40.789 --> 27:41.964
I'm bored.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.531
Uh-huh.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.144
Whose are these?

27:48.144 --> 27:50.190
Don't touch that.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.844
How come?

27:51.844 --> 27:54.411
It's not a toy.
It's a tool.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.068
Then why do they say
"play the drums"?

28:00.374 --> 28:02.593
Okay, I got to go out,

28:02.593 --> 28:04.726
see my physical therapist.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.295
What about dinner?

28:09.513 --> 28:12.908
Um, she'll bring you something.

28:12.908 --> 28:14.344
Probably.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.870
Okay.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.394
Don't burn the house down.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.952
Problem, maybe.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.608
Vivian or his man
won't take my call.

29:00.608 --> 29:04.133
Out of the office,
his girl said. Unreachable.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.700
Unreachable?

29:05.700 --> 29:08.529
Indefinitely unreachable.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.619
What are they up to?

29:11.619 --> 29:14.535
Uh, holding our feet
to the fire, maybe.

29:14.535 --> 29:17.146
Playing hard to get. Uh...

29:17.146 --> 29:18.757
and then...

29:18.757 --> 29:20.106
there's this.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.586
What's that?

29:22.586 --> 29:25.328
Uh, it's a...
it's a dress shirt, I think.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.287
It's pink.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.116
Uh, someone dropped
this off for you at reception.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.248
- For me?
- Yeah.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.772
It's monogrammed.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.774
So it is.

29:36.731 --> 29:37.950
V.D.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.737
Oh, and you got this note.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.531
- Security saw this?
- Yeah.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.012
They got a handwriting guy
working on it, they said.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.885
Seeing if they can
trace the author.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.625
What's it mean, you think--

30:01.625 --> 30:03.192
"Not on my watch"?

30:03.192 --> 30:04.803
And what's with the silver star?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.022
Means the deal's off.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.156
Thanks to Dorothy's husband.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.419
- Wayne?
- No.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.768
Idiot.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.510
The first husband.
The sheriff.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.426
I didn't give him
what he wanted, so...

30:19.426 --> 30:21.776
this is tit for that.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.952
Look who's up and around.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.519
Oh, not now.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.303
Oh, Mrs. Lyon.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.088
Hey there, slugger.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.872
How are you feeling?

30:33.570 --> 30:35.790
- Confused.
- I thought

30:35.790 --> 30:38.053
- you were taking him
to the house.
- Yes, ma'am,

30:38.053 --> 30:40.055
but he wanted to see you.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.623
I want to go home.

30:43.537 --> 30:46.018
My home.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.498
Sorry.

30:48.498 --> 30:50.370
Your wife burned the house down.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.720
I told him, but he
keeps asking for her.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.027
Mrs. Lyon.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.333
The other.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.987
Mm.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.902
She...

31:00.902 --> 31:03.209
she went out of town
for a few days.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.211
Sightseeing.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.169
And took Scotty with her.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.737
They said
you're supposed to rest.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.871
So, Jerome's gonna
take you home.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.831
We made up your old room,
we got out all your stuffies.

31:16.831 --> 31:19.878
I'll be home later,
and we can visit.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.707
Chef's making boeuf bourguignon

31:23.707 --> 31:25.796
with those-those little
onions you like.

31:25.796 --> 31:30.279
M... M-Mom, I wa... I w...

31:42.944 --> 31:45.207
Get Vivian's cell phone number,

31:45.207 --> 31:46.861
I don't care how.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.038
And then gas up the Porsche.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.128
Where am I going?

31:57.263 --> 31:59.395
To steal an election.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.593
Look at you.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.812
This is a nice kit.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.162
Well, it ought to be.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.902
Cost enough.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.948
Yeah, that was his last dream,

33:13.948 --> 33:16.168
Mr. Pie in the Sky.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.561
How was your day?

33:19.519 --> 33:21.129
Super boring.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.176
Where's Lars?

33:24.176 --> 33:25.264
He left.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.005
He...

33:27.005 --> 33:28.528
Physical therapy or something.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.139
But that was, like, an hour ago.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.011
Did you bring dinner?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.709
What was the last thing you ate?

33:35.709 --> 33:37.928
I had some crackers before.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.539
Like, at lunch.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.023
Okay, then.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.154
Let's get your stuff.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.851
Where are we going?

33:47.851 --> 33:49.636
To Grandma's.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.264
Yeah, you'll be safe here.

34:10.352 --> 34:11.658
<i>All right,</i>

34:11.658 --> 34:13.486
let them have it, boys.

34:13.486 --> 34:16.010
<i>Nein! Ich bin ein Amrikaner.</i>

34:16.010 --> 34:17.925
No, they're not! Fire!

34:19.622 --> 34:21.972
Aah!

34:30.416 --> 34:31.939
Look who I found.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.206
Go ahead.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.645
Daddy!

34:47.215 --> 34:48.564
Scotty.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.220
Hey.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.964
- I love you.
- I missed you so much.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.313
Oh, Scotty.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.054
Guess what, yesterday I got...

35:01.708 --> 35:03.579
Yeah.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.581
- Oh, yeah?
- Your hand
looks better.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.330
What, did her mother have her

35:15.330 --> 35:17.463
turning tricks
outside the Save Mart?

35:18.464 --> 35:19.813
I'm sorry?

35:19.813 --> 35:21.945
Don't do that.
Women who apologize

35:21.945 --> 35:23.991
for things that
aren't their fault

35:23.991 --> 35:27.212
might as well have "welcome mat"
written on their faces.

35:29.562 --> 35:30.911
Now you tell me.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.611
What's that?

35:36.960 --> 35:38.571
That's the history
of your daughter-in-law,

35:38.571 --> 35:41.313
written in punches
and chokeholds.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.534
Well, I'm sure I don't
need to see that.

35:46.535 --> 35:47.754
People who claim to be victims

35:47.754 --> 35:49.147
are the downfall
of this country.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.889
Mrs. Lyon,
have you ever in your life

35:52.889 --> 35:54.195
heard your daughter-in-law say

35:54.195 --> 35:55.805
that she was a victim?
Of anything?

35:55.805 --> 35:58.156
You may not like it,
but sometimes

35:58.156 --> 35:59.940
crimes are committed
against people.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.551
They're victimized.
And it's not their fault.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.685
I told him not to marry her.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.121
This whole sordid mess.

36:07.121 --> 36:08.905
You're saying
if a woman is abused

36:08.905 --> 36:10.559
and she manages to escape,

36:10.559 --> 36:13.432
she should move to the woods,
live in a tree,

36:13.432 --> 36:15.651
free from the burdens
of basic human contact?

36:15.651 --> 36:17.784
God forbid
she gets a fresh start,

36:17.784 --> 36:19.655
a good man to wash out
the taste of the bad.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.004
I don't like your tone.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.484
Tough shit.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.404
Some of us work for a living
and go home to empty houses

36:29.404 --> 36:31.711
or-or houses that should be
empty but are instead filled

36:31.711 --> 36:34.975
with the dirty underpants
of our man-child spouses.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.499
Your problem
is you think that you're rich

36:37.499 --> 36:38.718
cause you're better than me.

36:38.718 --> 36:39.806
Oh, please.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.677
We're the same.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.898
Up before dawn,
making our mark on the world.

36:44.898 --> 36:48.728
- But you know who
you're really in sync with?
- Hm?

36:48.728 --> 36:50.512
Dorothy.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.514
Yeah.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.124
I know you don't want to see it,

36:54.124 --> 36:56.301
but let me tell you what I see.

36:56.301 --> 37:00.130
I see a woman
who outsmarted two kidnappers,

37:00.130 --> 37:02.916
killed one of them
and nearly killed the other

37:02.916 --> 37:05.092
and who probably saved your son
and granddaughter's lives

37:05.092 --> 37:07.573
when they came at her
again at the house.

37:07.573 --> 37:10.924
I see a woman who doesn't quit,
no matter what.

37:10.924 --> 37:13.100
Who won't be silenced.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.928
And, unlike you,

37:14.928 --> 37:17.104
who never complains.

37:18.453 --> 37:19.889
Even when her mother-in-law
has her committed

37:19.889 --> 37:21.543
to a mental hospital.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.244
So I brought you her file

37:26.244 --> 37:28.333
so at least you could be
an educated asshole.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.902
Come work for me.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.644
What?

37:35.644 --> 37:37.472
You saw the security team.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.257
All those dicks.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.563
Think about how that looks
for a woman in my position.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.174
Come be window dressing--
that's the offer?

37:44.174 --> 37:46.786
No, no.
Come run the security team,

37:46.786 --> 37:48.266
be their boss.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.877
I know you need the money.

37:50.877 --> 37:53.140
I can help with your debt,
consolidate it,

37:53.140 --> 37:54.576
set up a payment schedule,

37:54.576 --> 37:56.796
get the jackals off your back.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.712
Name your price.

38:01.322 --> 38:02.367
That's...

38:03.585 --> 38:05.326
I've got a job.

38:05.326 --> 38:09.243
Cleaning vomit out of
the back of a squad car.

38:09.243 --> 38:12.290
And look what
they make you wear.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.902
I'm talking about
a white collar job,

38:15.902 --> 38:18.557
a white collar salary
with benefits,

38:18.557 --> 38:21.299
running a team of agents,
traveling the world.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.823
I mean, you can't-you can't
seriously turn that down.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.304
Otherwise, you and I
are nothing alike.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.138
It's kind of you.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.531
No, it's not.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.491
It's smart.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.363
Take the job.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.366
I...

38:45.366 --> 38:47.629
I-I've got to think about it,

38:47.629 --> 38:49.762
- if that's...
- Don't ask for permission.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.766
Right.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.899
I'm gonna think about it.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.860
And in the meantime,

39:00.860 --> 39:03.428
think about what I said.

39:03.428 --> 39:04.994
About Dorothy.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.693
She's out there somewhere.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.130
And she's not asking for help.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.088
But she needs it.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.011
You've got 24 hours.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.145
Or the opportunity disappears.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.280
That's how the world works.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.370
This brief window.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.503
Thank you.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.331
Aw, bet you didn't think
you were gonna say that

39:37.331 --> 39:39.507
and mean it
when you walked in here.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.292
Mr. Dugger.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.731
- I have a call for you.
- What?

40:29.731 --> 40:32.778
Thank you. Thanks.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.563
Danish Graves,
Redemption Services,

40:35.563 --> 40:37.217
in case you forgot.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.088
And I have Mrs. Lyon
on the phone.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.438
For you.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.526
What?

40:51.231 --> 40:52.275
Hello?

40:52.275 --> 40:54.408
Are your balls in your belly,

40:54.408 --> 40:57.237
looking for a safe
place to hide?

40:58.543 --> 41:00.458
<i>Good.</i>

41:00.458 --> 41:01.981
<i>Listen to me.</i>

41:01.981 --> 41:03.765
<i>I'm pulling the offer.</i>

41:03.765 --> 41:05.898
That $100 million

41:05.898 --> 41:08.988
is going to Mesa Prudential

41:08.988 --> 41:12.121
<i>out in Flagstaff.</i>

41:12.121 --> 41:14.689
<i>What you get instead
is the full might</i>

41:14.689 --> 41:17.213
<i>of the federal government</i>

41:17.213 --> 41:19.346
reading the shit stains
in your underwear

41:19.346 --> 41:21.696
like tea leaves.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.306
Mrs. Lyon...

41:23.306 --> 41:25.221
Quiet.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.180
A grown-up is talking.

41:27.180 --> 41:31.750
I called the SEC chairman personally.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.143
And as we speak,

41:34.143 --> 41:36.406
two dozen federal agents

41:36.406 --> 41:40.759
are in your office,
seizing your books.

41:40.759 --> 41:44.023
<i>They've also frozen
every personal</i>

41:44.023 --> 41:47.200
<i>and business bank account
you've got.</i>

41:47.200 --> 41:49.071
<i>So...</i>

41:49.071 --> 41:51.291
I hope you didn't give
all your walking-around money

41:51.291 --> 41:53.511
to that stripper.

41:55.948 --> 41:59.125
Oh. Plus, I-I hear

41:59.125 --> 42:01.040
your son is starting
his freshman year

42:01.040 --> 42:03.303
at, um, Notre Dame?

42:03.303 --> 42:07.481
Except, whoops.

42:07.481 --> 42:10.136
You're late on tuition.

42:10.136 --> 42:13.879
<i>So, hmm.</i>

42:13.879 --> 42:15.315
<i>Oh, that ring you hear--</i>

42:15.315 --> 42:17.665
<i>that's your son
on the other line</i>

42:17.665 --> 42:20.712
<i>calling to tell you
he's been expelled.</i>

42:20.712 --> 42:22.670
Mrs. Lyon, please.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.629
Oh, "please."

42:24.629 --> 42:26.892
That's your secret weapon?

42:29.242 --> 42:31.549
Do you want to know
what your mistake was?

42:31.549 --> 42:35.248
It was thinking
death is the worst thing

42:35.248 --> 42:36.902
that could happen to you.

42:38.077 --> 42:39.861
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

42:39.861 --> 42:42.908
<i>The sheriff's
not gonna kill you.</i>

42:42.908 --> 42:46.564
<i>Instead you're going to live
the rest of your days</i>

42:46.564 --> 42:48.653
<i>in squalor,</i>

42:48.653 --> 42:50.698
<i>surrounded by
the dead-eyed stares</i>

42:50.698 --> 42:53.614
<i>of your futureless children.</i>

43:05.060 --> 43:06.584
Have a nice night.

46:39.187 --> 46:42.147
<i>Now I get it.</i>
