00:05.005 --> 00:06.876
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

00:08.138 --> 00:09.574
Hi.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.315
Mommy?

00:12.969 --> 00:15.319
I'm so happy to see you.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.279
Who's Sheriff Roy?

00:20.368 --> 00:23.110
I need to leave Scotty here
for a few days.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.068
Two, three, maybe.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.070
Tops.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.811
I got to do something.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.856
<i>She's not safe.</i>

00:30.856 --> 00:32.554
<i>You find her?</i>

00:32.554 --> 00:33.685
<i>Dad, come on.</i>

00:33.685 --> 00:34.947
<i>You're not paying this guy.</i>

00:35.905 --> 00:38.516
Solve it with a bullet, not...

00:38.516 --> 00:40.649
<i>We tried killing him.</i>

00:40.649 --> 00:44.348
<i>Now we're bailing water
out of a sinking boat.</i>

00:44.348 --> 00:47.482
We need to take luck
out of the equation. Period.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.179
<i>End of story.</i>

00:49.179 --> 00:50.659
<i>We have business.</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.139
<i>Now, I didn't make your deal,</i>

00:52.139 --> 00:53.966
<i>but if I had,
I would have been clear.</i>

00:53.966 --> 00:56.926
That woman's like a tick.

00:56.926 --> 01:00.103
Can't crush her,
can't pull her out clean.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.714
Suffocation is the key.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.890
Probably ought
to let her be, but...

01:09.634 --> 01:11.375
<i>Happy now, shitbird?</i>

01:11.375 --> 01:13.464
<i>You got your money?</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:17.990
<i>I'll see you soon, asshole.</i>

01:35.182 --> 01:37.488
Jesus Christ.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.204
Ma!

02:00.511 --> 02:01.773
Ma!

02:03.079 --> 02:05.299
I'm coming, I'm coming. Geez.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.650
Don't break the door down.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.224
I'm freezing my balls off
out there, Ma,

02:17.224 --> 02:20.314
waiting for you to get
off your fat ass and...

02:23.621 --> 02:25.667
Why you got to say that, huh?

02:25.667 --> 02:28.017
Like I'm some kind
of deadbeat, huh?

02:30.324 --> 02:32.761
Make me a fucking sandwich.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.332
A setup is what it is.

02:38.332 --> 02:40.551
Check in every week, get a job,
but nobody's hiring.

02:40.551 --> 02:43.293
Piss in a cup, stay clean.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.643
I need a fucking smoke.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.777
God. These fucking guys.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.171
Fucking guys. I'm telling you...

02:51.171 --> 02:54.739
Use the spicy mustard and, uh,
don't Jew me on the meat.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.480
Uh-huh.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.445
Six bucks? What the fuck, Ma?

03:04.445 --> 03:07.230
Disability check comes in
on the eighth.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.190
You tell me how to stretch it.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.105
Maybe don't buy a hundred
six-packs of beer, eh?

03:13.105 --> 03:15.673
Whoa. What the fuck, Ma?

03:15.673 --> 03:17.719
Who the fuck is this?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.982
I live here now.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.768
What? A... a boarder?

03:23.768 --> 03:26.423
You holding out on me, Ma?
How much is he paying you?

03:28.512 --> 03:30.471
Trade.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.386
- What?
- No payment.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.996
Trade.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.911
What kind of trade?
That sounds like bullshit.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.478
Like the dog in the yard.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.349
We guard the house.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.046
Is he for real, Ma?

03:44.093 --> 03:46.138
Listen up, shitbird.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.010
Your freeloading days are over.

03:48.010 --> 03:51.100
Landlord's here now, so you're
gonna pay for room and board

03:51.100 --> 03:52.928
or I'm gonna cut you
a new suck hole.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.278
Or how about I call the law,

03:55.278 --> 03:58.890
tell them you're taking
advantage of a poor old widow.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.154
Either way, you better show me
some cheddar pronto.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.299
Fuckin' A.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.869
Same amount every month, huh?

04:23.437 --> 04:25.787
Got to go, Ma. Forgot a thing.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.107

Sugar's by the ketchup.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.119

07:05.337 --> 07:07.122
- Sorry?
- Are you heading

07:07.122 --> 07:09.385
to something
or away from something?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.519
Home.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.739
As in your going home
or running away from home?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
Are your pancakes any good?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440

09:41.102 --> 09:42.712
No.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.367
Shoot.

11:41.962 --> 11:45.356
Stupid, ugly, clumsy.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.706
Whore.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.841
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.451
It won't happen again.

11:53.451 --> 11:54.757
I promise.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.455
Please. Please calm down.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.544
It-it was an accident.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.372
Don't touch me.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.113
I'll kill you.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.151
<i>Good morning, Lindas.</i>

12:41.151 --> 12:43.937
<i>Breakfast is now being served
in the main lodge.</i>

12:43.937 --> 12:46.156
<i>This morning, we have...</i>

12:51.988 --> 12:53.903
Said the baby bear
to the mama bear,

12:53.903 --> 12:56.384
"Someone's been sleeping
in my bed."

12:58.778 --> 13:00.214
"She's still there."

13:04.000 --> 13:06.046
I'm looking for Linda.

13:07.438 --> 13:09.136
You found her.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.659
No, that's...

13:13.314 --> 13:15.664
She was Tillman, my Linda.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.318
Linda Tillman.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
That's her married name?

13:21.670 --> 13:23.411
I had one of those, too.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.108
Most of us did.

13:25.108 --> 13:28.590
Husbands' names,
boyfriends' names.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.201
Now we're just Lindas.
Or variations.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.900
I earned my first
new letter last week,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.076
so you can call me Lindo.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.776
I don't understand.

13:42.517 --> 13:46.086
When you leave a man
who abuses and controls you

13:46.086 --> 13:48.479
and you find this place,

13:48.479 --> 13:50.307
you take on a new name.

13:50.307 --> 13:53.093
A transition name. Linda.

13:53.093 --> 13:56.966
But my Linda
was named Linda before.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.576
Oh.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.404
That Linda.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.712
She sent me a postcard.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.898
Can I ask
what that was last night?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.813
Some kind of puppet show?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.470
Hungry?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.909
It's a beautiful day.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.045
Welcome, Linda.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.445
Why am I so tired?

14:41.445 --> 14:44.144
It's kind of a death,
what they do to us.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.102
Our men.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.931
The way they make us
feel about ourselves.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.802
No, that's...

14:51.803 --> 14:53.675
I love my husband.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.807
It's been ten years of bliss.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.290
Honestly, I'm not here
about him.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.511
This is a long-ago story
come back to haunt me.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.731
Hi, Linda.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.083
That's why I need her help.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.736
My Linda.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.217
Saint Linda.
That's what we call her.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.439
Oh, you're serious.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.405
Welcome, Linda.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.711
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.060
Welcome, Linda.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.584
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.543
This is the main house,

15:35.543 --> 15:38.938
where we gather for meals
and conversation.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.766
All of it, she built--
Saint Linda--

15:41.766 --> 15:45.205
so we could come and be reborn.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.033
And every week,
one of us leaves,

15:47.033 --> 15:49.339
but she stays.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.951
- Welcome, Linda.
- Welcome, Linda.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.519
You say you knew her before?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.695
She took me in
when I was on the street.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.915
Mm.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.048
So like a mother.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.833
More like a Venus flytrap.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.356
What?

16:06.356 --> 16:08.358
- Hello, Linda.
- Hi, Lindo.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.925
Welcome, Linda.

16:09.925 --> 16:13.537
Is she here?
I'd really like to say hello.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.061
Sure.

16:19.804 --> 16:23.852
Linda, I have a visitor here
that wants to pay tribute.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.942
Nadine.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.468
- Let go of me. Let--
- No, don't hurt her.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.688
- It's okay.
- Let go of me!

16:33.688 --> 16:34.906
It's okay.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.868
You must think I deserve that.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.609
We can talk about that
in the car.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.915
Am I going someplace?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.526
Get your stuff.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.355
He found me. Roy.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.183
I need you to come
and tell the cops

16:50.183 --> 16:52.489
about all the bad he did
when you were married

16:52.489 --> 16:53.882
so they can put him in jail.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.492
Nadine--

16:55.492 --> 16:58.321
It's Dorothy now. Dot.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
So you made the puppet.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.716
What?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.415
I can't leave.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.026
They need me here.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.812
I need you more, and you owe me.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.641
I gave you a home,
three meals a day.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.686
What could I possibly owe you?

17:15.686 --> 17:18.037
You used me.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.864
You fed me to him
so you could escape.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.128
We both made choices.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.304
You left your boy, too.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.088
Gator.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.091
And just so I know,
do you have children?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.701
I've got a daughter.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.399
Where is she?

17:33.878 --> 17:36.185
So you left her, too.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.927
No.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.321
I came to get you so we can...

17:43.975 --> 17:45.673
I'm going back.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.804
A trial.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.894
- We need to have a trial.
- Yes.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.983
No. What does that...

17:51.983 --> 17:53.463
I don't have time.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.683
When there are
two versions of the truth,

17:55.683 --> 17:58.947
we have to reconcile them,
so we hold a tribunal.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.862
I've told my truth already.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.865
You tell yours,
and the Lindas will watch

18:03.865 --> 18:07.042
and help us find the true truth.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.000
It's the only way.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.700
Fine. I'll tell the truth.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.918
No.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.833
First, you make your puppet.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.459
Name two mammals that lay eggs.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.853
I don't think that's
how homework works.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.725
Platypus.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.423
Okay.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.426
And like a spiny anteater.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.473
How do you...

18:47.778 --> 18:49.389
Would you look at that.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.086
Boss.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.827
I got a family here with
their hearts set on a new Rio.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.220
Well, heck of a nice car.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.787
Oh, yeah.
Uh, ran their credit, though.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.963
- Not gonna happen.
- Well, that's a shame.

18:58.963 --> 19:02.184
"Echidnas, sometimes known
as spiny anteaters,

19:02.184 --> 19:04.534
are quill-covered monotremes."

19:04.534 --> 19:07.320
Huh. Have you seen these things?

19:07.320 --> 19:10.627
It's, uh,
a mammal that lays eggs.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.152
- Geez.
- Yeah.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.328
Well, like I said,
even with their trade-in--

19:15.328 --> 19:18.157
and they got a 2005 Sportage
in pretty good shape--

19:18.157 --> 19:19.941
uh, they don't qualify.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.290
Oh.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.294
It's a nice-looking family.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.078
- Right?
- Hmm.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.993
Unless, uh,

19:28.993 --> 19:30.952
a car for a car.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.606
Just trade.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.652
E-Except that's not really
how capitalism works.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.219
A car for a car.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.090
- Right, but--
- Because what do we do here?

19:39.090 --> 19:41.092
Well, we sell--

19:41.092 --> 19:44.400
Well, people need a car,
and they-they come to us.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.228
- To buy--
- Yeah, well, you said yourself,

19:46.228 --> 19:48.926
the 2005's in good shape.

19:48.926 --> 19:52.191
Yeah, but, boss,
Blue Book on that's 6,200--

19:52.191 --> 19:53.931
So we trade.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.498
And-and the Rio, that's--

19:55.498 --> 19:58.414
- How many eggs does the, uh--
- 19,500.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.547
- The spiny anteater?
- Boss?

20:00.547 --> 20:04.159
It says one egg makes a baby
the size of a jelly bean.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.552
Um, so--

20:05.552 --> 20:07.641
Well, you were
more of a jelly donut.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.906
- So, on the-- Boss?
- What kind of jelly?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.647
- On the--
- Raspberry.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.344
So, on the Rio--

20:15.344 --> 20:17.477
- Huh?
- The Rio?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.392
Oh, we-we solved that,
I thought.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.656
Give a car, get a car.

20:22.656 --> 20:26.355
Each has received a gift,
use it to serve one another.

20:26.355 --> 20:29.140
That's in the Bible. Right?

20:30.272 --> 20:32.100
Sure, then. Okay.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.023
Congratulations.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.027
Can we get doughnuts?

20:46.027 --> 20:47.681
Sure can.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.073
And bear claws for your mom.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.467
Is she back?

20:56.298 --> 20:58.909
No, hon. Sorry.
I-I got confused.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.913
No, Mom is, uh...

21:03.914 --> 21:05.307
She's still out there.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.662
Maybe skip the doughnuts, then.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.534
She'd want us
to eat a vegetable.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.362
Yeah, she would.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.928
Come here.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.105
<i>This is your workstation.</i>

21:21.105 --> 21:23.499
Choose the wood, make the doll,

21:23.499 --> 21:25.762
dress the doll,
choose some hair and makeup.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.590
And then the final step.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.549
They've already
come for me twice.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.028
And my family.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.292
You tell your story,
through the puppet,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.468
and in this way,
you expel the trauma

21:35.468 --> 21:37.383
so you can start again.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.385
Then you take
your new name and leave.

21:39.385 --> 21:42.518
I've done this. I have a name.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.434
Start by examining the wood,
really see yourself in it.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.696
For some, this process
takes weeks, months.

21:46.696 --> 21:47.828
This is...

21:50.874 --> 21:52.702
I am the me I want to be.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.879
I'm here to do something.

21:56.924 --> 22:00.275
I know.

22:00.275 --> 22:03.017
I have to make this doll, yeah?
There's no way around it?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.497
If you want to tell your story.

22:04.497 --> 22:08.109
I don't.
I want to take Linda and go.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.024
The next step
is to saw the wood,

22:10.024 --> 22:11.982
soften its edges for shaping.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.775
Can I carve?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.429
I feel like you're rushing.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.039
No shit.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.610
Cheers.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.443
Come here.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.840
We take turns who runs the meal.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.799
Family recipes.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.453
It was Belin's turn tonight.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.280
Who doesn't like
a good chicken piccata?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.717
How about you?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.632
Do you have
a go-to for the rotation?

22:52.632 --> 22:54.938
Something that always
hits the spot?

22:54.938 --> 22:57.898
Well, my Wayne
likes shepherd's pie.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.769
Mmm.

22:59.769 --> 23:02.990
And Scotty, she likes
breakfast for dinner.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.818
- Pancakes and the like.
- Mm.

23:06.907 --> 23:09.300
What do you like?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.215
I like all of it.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.217
Oh, and Sister Schubert.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.611
She makes those rolls, you pop
'em just right in the oven.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.744
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.139
You haven't asked about him.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.532
Gator.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.710
He's trying, I think.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.800
He's got to be, what, 27 now?

23:32.454 --> 23:35.457
You can see it in his eyes,
he wants to be good.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.332
But more than that,
he wants to be like his dad.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.813
You see things clearly, dear.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.687
You always did.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.478
Look,

23:56.478 --> 23:58.959
I think it's wonderful
what you're doing here.

24:01.048 --> 24:05.182
This place you've made
for suffering.

24:05.182 --> 24:08.708
But I don't need a doll
to say what's on my mind.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.537
Maybe I could have used one

24:11.537 --> 24:15.628
before Wayne and this new life,

24:15.628 --> 24:18.544
but I am in control now.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.763
I know who I am

24:20.763 --> 24:23.592
and what's important.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.595
So if there's any way
that we could skip--

24:26.595 --> 24:29.555
It's not gonna work, dear.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.514
You came here to confront me,

24:32.514 --> 24:36.257
the things you think I did,
what happened after I was gone.

24:36.257 --> 24:40.391
This is the process.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.958
You wouldn't be here

24:41.958 --> 24:45.962
if you didn't need to be here.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.707
I came for you.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.711
And to take you back to testify.

24:55.711 --> 25:00.803
And what I'm saying is
you need to testify first.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.502
Then we can decide if
I should go or you should stay.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.506
Now, eat your piccata.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.008
Ole Munch on this.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.146
Got you, fucker.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.704
Yes.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.199
Fuck.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.127
No fucking way.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.388
Thief!

28:59.825 --> 29:01.696
Whoa!

29:01.696 --> 29:03.524
Monster! Don't!

29:05.047 --> 29:06.135
Ow!

30:32.482 --> 30:33.570
Dad?

30:33.570 --> 30:36.138
Yeah, babe.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.574
It's bedtime.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.272
Uh-huh.

30:39.272 --> 30:40.577
You got to read.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.231
I got to read.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.324
Oh, wait. It-it's bedtime.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.979
That's what I said.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.894
Yeah.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.941
I got to read.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.030
All right, move over, you.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.168
Where's the book?

31:06.168 --> 31:08.214
What?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.868
The book.

31:12.174 --> 31:15.612
What do you mean?
It's, uh... it's right here.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.223
You can't see it?

31:17.223 --> 31:18.702
- You're silly.
- Yeah.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.704
Hold that for a sec.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.318
All right.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.886
Here we go.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.366
All right.

31:30.366 --> 31:34.153
Chapter One: The Hero.

31:36.155 --> 31:38.331
Once upon a time...

31:39.636 --> 31:41.682
...there was a girl named Dot.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.685
<i>Dorothy.</i>

31:44.685 --> 31:46.643
<i>She was the sun's favorite.</i>

31:46.643 --> 31:48.732
You know, the, uh...

31:48.732 --> 31:51.039
the sun?

31:51.039 --> 31:54.521
And everywhere she went,
there were rainbows.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.959
-"Dorothy." Like Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.789
<i>And she could do anything,</i>

32:01.789 --> 32:03.182
<i>our Dorothy.</i>

32:03.182 --> 32:04.400
<i>You know, she could,</i>

32:04.400 --> 32:07.099
uh, climb a tree.

32:08.491 --> 32:11.799
She could, uh,
wrestle an alligator.

32:13.409 --> 32:16.412
And everyone she met,

32:16.412 --> 32:19.198
she put a smile on their face.

32:20.503 --> 32:24.029
<i>But the darkness
hates the light,</i>

32:24.029 --> 32:27.554
<i>and the ugly things
come out at night.</i>

32:27.554 --> 32:30.774
<i>And so she, our Dot...</i>

32:32.385 --> 32:37.085
...in order to save
the rainbows,

32:37.085 --> 32:39.914
she had to go fight
against the darkness.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.656
Screw it.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.484
<i>And leave the, uh...</i>

32:44.484 --> 32:49.663
<i>the flowers and the birds
at home.</i>

32:51.230 --> 32:53.928
Her family, I'm saying.

32:55.669 --> 32:59.586
<i>Because until you go someplace,</i>

32:59.586 --> 33:01.805
you can't come home.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.727
Look at you, up and at 'em.

33:12.294 --> 33:15.254
This puppet's not
gonna make itself.

We welcome you, our sister.

34:22.451 --> 34:25.150
Let us gather now
to hear your testimony.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.848
She has come here to share

34:27.848 --> 34:31.504
her struggle and her pain.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.942
Let no one challenge
or interrupt our sister.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.686
The truth she speaks
is her truth,

34:39.686 --> 34:41.427
and we will hear it all.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.553
<i>Before this,</i>

35:20.553 --> 35:22.642
<i>before I was a mother</i>

35:22.642 --> 35:24.905
<i>and a wife</i>

35:24.905 --> 35:27.212
<i>and a different wife,</i>

35:27.212 --> 35:29.083
<i>I was a girl.</i>

35:31.477 --> 35:33.957
<i>All skinned knees
and make-believe.</i>

35:38.919 --> 35:43.053
<i>And then I got my monthly,
and the wolves came.</i>

35:51.888 --> 35:55.588
<i>And once I was running,
I ran away from everything.</i>

35:57.329 --> 35:58.547
<i>Home,</i>

35:58.547 --> 36:00.462
<i>boys,</i>

36:00.462 --> 36:02.334
<i>the future.</i>

36:04.336 --> 36:06.773
Oh, no, you don't.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.427
<i>And that's when I met Linda.</i>

36:08.427 --> 36:09.863
Now, Carl,

36:09.863 --> 36:12.344
you take your hands
off that girl.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.346
She's with me.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.783
Sorry, Ms. Tillman. It's just,

36:16.783 --> 36:19.786
I caught her putting
chocolate chips in her pocket.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.397
Well, where else
is she supposed to put 'em?

36:22.397 --> 36:25.313
You got rid of all the baskets.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.797
<i>When she heard I had
nowhere else to go,</i>

36:30.797 --> 36:32.581
<i>Linda took me home.</i>

36:34.453 --> 36:36.803
Look what I got
at the grocery store.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.327
Can we keep her, Dad? Can we?

36:40.546 --> 36:42.678
What's your name, sunshine?

36:42.678 --> 36:44.158
Nadine.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.160
Yeah? Like the song?

36:46.160 --> 36:50.817
<i>♪ Oh, Nadine,
honey, is that you?♪</i>

36:50.817 --> 36:52.993
<i>I was 15,</i>

36:52.993 --> 36:55.387
<i>and he didn't look at me
like a wolf.</i>

36:55.387 --> 36:58.041
<i>He was big and stern like a dad,</i>

36:58.041 --> 36:59.478
<i>but funny.</i>

36:59.478 --> 37:01.828
If she's gonna stay here,

37:01.828 --> 37:05.527
she's gonna work for her supper,
same as everybody else.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.922
What she needs is
to finish her education.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.272
Spend an hour with the studs
at breeding time,

37:11.272 --> 37:13.318
and you can learn
a whole hell of a lot.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.971
Ow.

37:14.971 --> 37:18.758
Well, I can read with her,

37:18.758 --> 37:22.196
but, Roy,
you're so much better at math

37:22.196 --> 37:26.200
and science and the like,
so really, you should teach her.

37:27.549 --> 37:29.421
<i>You see how that happened?</i>

37:29.421 --> 37:32.641
<i>How she pushed me towards him,</i>

37:32.641 --> 37:34.730
<i>made sure we could be alone?</i>

37:37.385 --> 37:39.169
<i>Things were bad for Linda, then.</i>

37:39.169 --> 37:40.345
Bitch.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.390
Stupid bitch.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.290
<i>But that's no excuse
for what happened next.</i>

38:15.902 --> 38:18.948
So, you carry the seven.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.689
See how that works?

38:20.689 --> 38:22.256
Uh-huh.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.084
Not so dumb after all, are you?

38:24.084 --> 38:25.651
No.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.435
Pretty, too.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.872
I bet you get your pick
of all the boys.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.789
Don't get shy
on me now, darling.

38:33.789 --> 38:36.357
We're peas in a pod, you and me.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.794
Why don't you come
sit on my lap?

38:40.709 --> 38:42.494
<i>The next day,</i>

38:42.494 --> 38:45.671
<i>Roy said Linda had to go
visit her sister</i>

38:45.671 --> 38:48.326
<i>and that I was the woman
of the house till she got back.</i>

38:51.720 --> 38:53.287
<i>You tell me she didn't know</i>

38:53.287 --> 38:55.158
<i>what was gonna happen.</i>

38:56.856 --> 38:59.728
Saw you limping a little before.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.339
You okay?

39:02.470 --> 39:04.429
I just...

39:04.429 --> 39:06.431
twisted my ankle a little.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.957
Here. Let me see.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.975
Here I am. Home again.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.759
Was it awful without me?

39:30.759 --> 39:32.979
Oh, no, we had a swell time.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.633
Didn't we, Nadine?

39:35.808 --> 39:38.158
<i>It got worse after that.</i>

39:38.158 --> 39:40.508
<i>He'd beat Linda every night
and then come to me</i>

39:40.508 --> 39:43.163
<i>smelling like sweat
and cigarettes.</i>

39:43.163 --> 39:46.079
<i>And then she was gone.</i>

39:46.079 --> 39:49.125
<i>Packed a bag, Roy said,
and left in the wee hours.</i>

39:49.125 --> 39:52.694
<i>But he wasn't sad, he said,
because he had me.</i>

39:53.869 --> 39:56.132
<i>And what we had was true love.</i>

40:00.180 --> 40:01.442
<i>And then I</i>

40:01.442 --> 40:03.401
was his puppet.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.584
Thank you for that.

40:58.586 --> 41:01.110
It wasn't easy to hear,
but we heard it.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.201
And so,

41:05.201 --> 41:07.160
you've earned a new name.

41:09.423 --> 41:10.903
What'll it be?

41:12.513 --> 41:14.602
I'm Dorothy.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.648
Dorothy Lyon.

41:21.740 --> 41:22.871
So,

41:22.871 --> 41:25.395
I will go with you.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.747
And we can face him together.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.272
You ready?

41:33.229 --> 41:35.101
I am.

41:45.807 --> 41:48.201
I'm sorry for leaving you.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.855
I really am.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.119
I know.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.905
He would have killed you.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.951
He tried to kill me.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.909
Fight or flight, they call it.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.394
I just wish...

42:09.439 --> 42:11.354
Why didn't you take us with you?

42:21.800 --> 42:23.715
It's okay.

42:23.715 --> 42:26.195
You'll tell me
when you're ready.

42:26.195 --> 42:29.372
All that matters is
thank you for doing this.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.856
This life I've fought
so hard for.

42:38.599 --> 42:39.861
I'll be grateful.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.737
Linda?

43:34.089 --> 43:35.308
You're awake.

43:35.308 --> 43:37.223
No, don't strain yourself.

43:37.223 --> 43:39.965
You hit your head
pretty hard there.

43:39.965 --> 43:41.401
My friend.

43:41.401 --> 43:42.750
Who?

43:43.925 --> 43:46.449
The woman. In my car.

43:47.712 --> 43:51.237
The Kia. Is she okay?

43:51.237 --> 43:52.847
Oh, I don't know, hon.

43:52.847 --> 43:54.588
You came in by yourself.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.372
But I--

43:56.372 --> 43:58.461
I'll go let your husband
know you're awake.

43:58.461 --> 44:00.420
He'll be so happy to hear.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.726
Wayne's here?

44:01.726 --> 44:03.292
Mm-hmm.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.033
It took us a beat
to identify you.

44:05.033 --> 44:07.383
You're very lucky.

44:07.383 --> 44:09.734
He's barely left your side.

44:09.734 --> 44:11.649
That sounds like my Wayne.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.216
Yeah. Easy on the eyes, too.

44:15.565 --> 44:17.132
I'll go fetch him for you, hon.

44:17.132 --> 44:18.699
Thank you.

44:47.380 --> 44:48.947
Nadine.

44:50.862 --> 44:52.864
You had us worried sick.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.708
I got you.

47:39.552 --> 47:41.467
<i>Now I get it.</i>
