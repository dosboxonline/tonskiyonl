00:51.696 --> 00:55.073
<i>In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched</i>

00:55.073 --> 00:59.454
<i>the world's first artificial satellite,
Sputnik 1, into orbit.</i>

00:59.454 --> 01:04.584
<i>Their achievement fueled a space race
between the United States and the Soviets.</i>

01:04.584 --> 01:07.420
<i>There has been some debate
about what followed</i>

01:07.420 --> 01:12.383
<i>but I was there,
and this is the real story. Mostly.</i>

01:12.383 --> 01:13.676
<i>Until two days ago,</i>

01:13.676 --> 01:16.095
<i>that sound had never been heard
on this earth.</i>

01:24.228 --> 01:28.274
<i>America attempted to launch her satellite
with disastrous results.</i>

01:32.487 --> 01:34.989
<i>The Soviet Union has sent a man into space</i>

01:34.989 --> 01:36.115
<i>and brought him back alive.</i>

01:36.115 --> 01:38.076
<i>The Soviets made the most of the flight</i>

01:38.076 --> 01:41.621
<i>in their worldwide propaganda.
Naturally, there was jubilation in Russia.</i>

01:42.872 --> 01:46.584
<i>Recognizing the head start obtained
by the Soviets,</i>

01:46.584 --> 01:51.005
<i>I believe that this nation should
commit itself to achieving the goal,</i>

01:51.005 --> 01:53.132
<i>before this decade is out,</i>

01:53.132 --> 01:57.011
<i>of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the earth.</i>

02:12.110 --> 02:15.071
<i>We choose to go to the moon in this decade</i>

02:15.071 --> 02:18.282
<i>and do the other things,
not because they are easy,</i>

02:18.282 --> 02:19.993
<i>but because they are hard.</i>

02:19.993 --> 02:23.538
<i>Because that challenge is one
that we are willing to accept,</i>

02:23.538 --> 02:26.332
<i>one we are unwilling to postpone,
and one we intend to win.</i>

02:26.332 --> 02:28.501
<i>Command Pilot.
One, two, three, four, five.</i>

02:28.501 --> 02:30.169
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

02:31.837 --> 02:32.672
<i>Flame!</i>

02:32.672 --> 02:34.882
<i>We've got a fire in the cockpit.</i>

02:34.882 --> 02:37.969
<i>Let's get out! We're burning up!</i>

02:37.969 --> 02:42.140
<i>Astronauts Virgil Grissom, Edward White
and Roger Chaffee have been killed.</i>

02:42.140 --> 02:44.225
<i>Press officials say
because of the tragedy,</i>

02:44.225 --> 02:47.645
<i>the Apollo 1 flight has now
been postponed indefinitely.</i>

02:47.645 --> 02:49.439
<i>I-- It's-- It's a groovy trip,</i>

02:49.439 --> 02:53.109
<i>but there are a lot more important things
to do first in the United States.</i>

02:53.109 --> 02:55.945
<i>Maybe when all that's taken care of
we can afford to go to the moon.</i>

02:55.945 --> 02:59.574
<i>We find ourselves
rich in goods but ragged in spirit.</i>

02:59.574 --> 03:02.327
<i>Reaching with magnificent precision
for the moon</i>

03:02.327 --> 03:04.579
<i>but falling into raucous discord on earth.</i>

03:04.579 --> 03:06.706
<i>We are caught at war wanting peace.</i>

03:06.706 --> 03:09.208
<i>We're torn by division wanting unity.</i>

03:09.208 --> 03:11.127
<i>This giant Saturn rocket</i>

03:11.127 --> 03:14.964
<i>and the rest of the equipment here
began as part of a race</i>

03:14.964 --> 03:17.216
<i>to beat the Russians
with the national goal</i>

03:17.216 --> 03:19.844
<i>of putting a man on the moon
in this decade.</i>

03:19.844 --> 03:23.222
<i>But their trip will cost
more than anyone thought it would.</i>

03:23.222 --> 03:28.269
<i>And their chances of landing on the moon
in the 1960s are increasingly slim.</i>

03:49.582 --> 03:51.876
First week as manager, Stu.
Doesn't sound like it's going great.

03:51.876 --> 03:54.921
So either our meters are off
or there's a breach in one of the tanks.

03:54.921 --> 03:57.882
But there's no protocol for this.
And we can't source the leak

03:57.882 --> 03:59.425
- because it's liquid hyd--
- Liquid hydrogen.

03:59.425 --> 04:01.844
It's colorless and odorless.
Everybody out! Let's go!

04:01.844 --> 04:03.429
Reed, Kyle, pencils down.

04:03.429 --> 04:05.723
It could be burning,
and we wouldn't know it. Find a door.

04:06.849 --> 04:08.768
Come on! Run, run! No walking.

04:16.234 --> 04:17.527
What's he doing? Is he cleaning?

04:17.527 --> 04:20.488
No, no. It's an--
It's an old-school leak detection process.

04:20.488 --> 04:21.572
It's a broom.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.618
Stu, you're better than this. Come on.
Straw plus liquid hydrogen equals...

04:33.668 --> 04:35.586
All right, we're good!
Don't worry about it. Come on.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.046
We got work to do. Let's go.

04:47.598 --> 04:49.642
The new protocol is the broom method.

04:52.562 --> 04:53.646
We need a new broom.

05:01.529 --> 05:02.989
I for sure thought he was dead.

05:02.989 --> 05:04.449
Come on.

05:07.327 --> 05:09.704
It's still broke from the last time
you were in a mood.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.414
Yeah, I can see that.

05:11.414 --> 05:14.417
- Boeing called again.
- Call Congress, Henry, not me.

05:15.585 --> 05:16.794
I don't have their number.

05:16.794 --> 05:20.298
Every day, every day,
something is breaking around here.

05:20.298 --> 05:24.427
Or blowing up.
We're underfunded, under-- understaffed.

05:24.427 --> 05:26.763
But yeah, we're still expected
to beat the pants off the Russians.

05:26.763 --> 05:29.265
You mind telling me how the hell
we're supposed to do that?

05:29.265 --> 05:31.768
Could start by being a little nicer
to the vending machines.

05:32.518 --> 05:33.436
There it is!

05:34.020 --> 05:35.938
- What?
- There's a cat.

05:35.938 --> 05:38.816
- So what?
- It's a black cat, Henry. It's bad luck.

05:41.444 --> 05:42.362
Okay, it's gone.

05:42.362 --> 05:46.491
- All right. Thank God.
- Okay. Let's go.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.743
- Call security.
- I won't.

05:48.743 --> 05:50.078
- I will not. It--
- Yes, you will.

05:50.078 --> 05:53.748
The last thing that we need around here
is a black cat.

05:53.748 --> 05:55.708
They don't deal with things like this.

05:55.708 --> 05:57.418
Yes, they do. They do now.

05:57.418 --> 06:00.964
- You're overreacting.
- No, you're not overreacting enough.

06:01.464 --> 06:03.800
Call 'em right now. Right now.

06:17.897 --> 06:19.148
How do I look?

06:19.148 --> 06:21.192
You're glowing. Good luck.

06:22.402 --> 06:23.611
Good afternoon, boys.

06:23.611 --> 06:26.489
Wrong room, sweetheart.
We don't need dictation.

06:26.489 --> 06:28.449
I'm Kelly Jones.
I'll be running the meeting today.

06:28.449 --> 06:30.451
You must be Phil Hunley, Neil Brown and--

06:32.120 --> 06:34.330
Zack Tanner.
You don't mind if I sit down, do you?

06:34.330 --> 06:37.458
All due respect, Mrs. Jones,
we're a progressive company.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.169
We employ 16 women in our steno pool.

06:40.169 --> 06:44.257
We're selling sports cars to men.
We're selling a 300 horsepower--

06:44.257 --> 06:48.303
355, 428 cubic inch V-8 beast
is what you're selling.

06:48.303 --> 06:51.389
You want to focus on the car's speed.
Something like this.

06:52.390 --> 06:58.104
Look familiar? Chevy Camaro.
Pontiac Firebird. And Oldsmobile.

06:58.104 --> 06:59.480
All from last month.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.984
Thankfully, you have something
that your competition doesn't have.

07:03.568 --> 07:09.240
The Mustang Fastback. "355 horses for him.
Seat belts for the family."

07:09.240 --> 07:13.369
The seat belts? We only put them in
because they might be mandatory next year.

07:13.369 --> 07:14.787
Let's play a game.

07:15.455 --> 07:18.666
Now I'm gonna guess what kind of car
each one of you gentlemen drive.

07:22.128 --> 07:28.760
Zack, Ford Mustang '66 convertible.
It's poppy red.

07:30.178 --> 07:35.350
No Mustangs for you husbands though.
A Lincoln Continental for Neil.

07:38.186 --> 07:43.441
A station wagon for poor Phil. Phil.
You know what the best part of my day is?

07:45.193 --> 07:47.945
When my husband Charlie
comes home at night.

07:49.489 --> 07:55.286
I can't even imagine what it would be like
if one night he-- he didn't.

07:55.286 --> 07:58.206
Now imagine the conversation

07:58.206 --> 08:02.460
if someone told your wife that this car,

08:02.460 --> 08:05.171
its 355 horses and 105 top speed,

08:05.171 --> 08:10.843
this car is what brings her husband home
safe to her family every night.

08:12.011 --> 08:13.846
Now she wants you to have it.

08:13.846 --> 08:17.558
She says the words every married man
dreams of hearing...

08:19.644 --> 08:21.145
"I'd feel so much better

08:21.145 --> 08:24.899
if you bought yourself
that Mustang, sweetheart."

08:31.155 --> 08:33.950
How did you guess what kind of cars
they drive?

08:33.950 --> 08:36.035
What, bribe their secretaries
or something?

08:37.161 --> 08:38.162
Kelly, seriously?

08:38.162 --> 08:40.707
Two packs of Virginia Slims
and a bottle of Paco Rabanne.

08:40.707 --> 08:42.625
Everyone has their price.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.545
I'm just lucky that my water didn't break
in there. Oh, God.

08:45.545 --> 08:47.547
Hi, Ron. How's the wife?

08:50.842 --> 08:53.094
Now, the baby bump, dry-clean only.

08:53.094 --> 08:56.596
Yes, I have that noted.
Also, Omega confirmed for next week,

08:56.596 --> 08:57.807
I finished the Baskin-Robbins artwork,

08:57.807 --> 09:00.518
and that guy from Palmex asked
for your address to send roses,

09:00.518 --> 09:01.728
but I gave him mine because I know

09:01.728 --> 09:03.896
- how you feel about roses.
- You know how I feel about roses.

09:03.896 --> 09:08.276
Also, John called. Again.
He wants to take you to dinner Tuesday.

09:08.276 --> 09:10.987
Tell him I moved to LA.
And call Bruce from Dow Chemical.

09:10.987 --> 09:13.406
I hear they're looking
for a new agency for Ziploc.

09:13.406 --> 09:15.867
People should be boycotting Dow.
They make napalm.

09:16.409 --> 09:19.537
People say they're boycotting,
but they're still buying sandwich bags.

09:19.537 --> 09:21.414
They also sell Saran Wrap and Styrofoam.

09:21.414 --> 09:24.417
Think people are going to stop using
Styrofoam? What's your coffee in?

09:24.417 --> 09:27.128
Now, I know you and your friends want
to save the world,

09:27.128 --> 09:29.672
and by the time
you're running this place in 1984,

09:29.672 --> 09:31.507
there's gonna be no nukes
and equal rights for all.

09:31.507 --> 09:33.635
But until then, we've got a job to do.

09:34.218 --> 09:39.432
Kelly! Kelly! Kelly. Kelly.
We've got a big problem.

09:39.432 --> 09:43.061
I just stormed off set,
and, yes, it was justified.

09:43.061 --> 09:45.647
I cannot work with these Hoover people.

09:45.647 --> 09:50.151
Apparently, they have issues with the way
that I am shooting their commercial.

09:50.151 --> 09:52.362
They actually said that.
"Their." It's my commercial.

09:52.362 --> 09:55.031
They make vacuums. I make art.

09:55.031 --> 09:56.908
- Sorry, did we have a meeting set?
- No. No.

09:56.908 --> 09:58.826
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I had to set a time

09:58.826 --> 10:00.328
to speak to one of my dearest friends.

10:00.328 --> 10:02.747
The last time we spoke, you fired me.
And I don't work for you.

10:02.747 --> 10:05.041
You know what, Kelly,
I didn't come in here to be berated.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.125
I came in to be agreed with!

10:06.125 --> 10:09.837
You have that Nestlé pitch in ten.
Very important.

10:09.837 --> 10:11.714
That is a lie. Goodbye.

10:11.714 --> 10:15.468
Lance, getting you this directing gig
was a Christmas miracle.

10:15.468 --> 10:18.054
It took me three weeks to convince them
that you were stable

10:18.054 --> 10:21.849
- after your Jell-O shoot from hell.
- Jell-O was not my fault.

10:21.849 --> 10:24.477
- That actor wa--
- Was five. You made him cry.

10:24.477 --> 10:26.938
Well, I did that child a favor.
Hollywood is no cakewalk.

10:26.938 --> 10:30.525
What about the Heinz commercial? You went
40,000 over budget. It was about ketchup.

10:31.067 --> 10:34.362
It was not about ketchup.
It was about the promise of ketchup.

10:34.362 --> 10:36.739
No one sees what I'm doing
for their products.

10:36.739 --> 10:37.991
I am elevating them.

10:37.991 --> 10:40.368
I should be in film by now.

10:40.368 --> 10:43.037
I passed on directing <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>.

10:43.037 --> 10:46.165
- That is on me, but still.
- Now, what do we call you, right?

10:46.165 --> 10:48.960
- The Kubrick of commercials. All right.
- Oh, my God. Stanley is a hack.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.004
He does one good movie,
and suddenly he's a genius.

10:51.004 --> 10:54.549
You are a legend, right? Creative genius.

10:54.549 --> 10:57.135
You're also hotheaded, mercurial
and can't stick to a budget for shit.

10:57.135 --> 10:59.012
- Oh, thank you.
- That wasn't a compliment.

10:59.012 --> 11:02.598
- It is when you stop listening.
- If you quit Hoover, you'll be unhirable.

11:05.268 --> 11:06.269
Okay.

11:07.103 --> 11:08.855
Lance, why don't you march your ass
back to set,

11:08.855 --> 11:10.606
and you apologize
for whatever fit you threw, okay?

11:10.606 --> 11:13.443
Buy your boyfriend something nice
for Christmas for putting up with you.

11:13.443 --> 11:14.819
Get something for me too, okay?

11:14.819 --> 11:17.363
- Merry Christmas, Lance.
- Merry Christmas.

11:17.363 --> 11:19.699
Can you get me a decent job, please?

11:24.787 --> 11:27.206
<i>Apollo 8
launched successfully this morning.</i>

11:27.206 --> 11:32.045
<i>A much needed win for NASA.
In Vietnam, more men were lost today.</i>

11:32.045 --> 11:33.880
<i>...and 15 million miles...</i>

11:33.880 --> 11:36.466
I'll have another round, please,
and a look at the dinner menu.

11:36.466 --> 11:37.759
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

11:40.970 --> 11:44.557
Two specials tonight. Chicken potpie
and Oysters Rockefeller.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.895
We'll do the chicken.
She's allergic to oysters.

11:49.437 --> 11:53.399
And I'll take a shot of Macallan, a lemon
and a cutting board.

11:53.399 --> 11:56.527
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?

11:57.070 --> 12:01.658
Seat belts in a sports car.
I mean, that's a great angle.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.452
Unfortunately, they're about
to kill the account.

12:05.411 --> 12:06.621
Why would they do that?

12:06.621 --> 12:11.334
Because someone told them that
you don't really have a bun in the oven.

12:15.713 --> 12:18.508
Phil. Let me explain.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.551
That's the last time I trust a woman.

12:21.052 --> 12:23.262
I actually sent you a baby gift.

12:23.262 --> 12:25.181
Which was so sweet, by the way.
Let me just--

12:25.181 --> 12:27.225
Neil, let me explain. If you--

12:27.225 --> 12:29.310
What is this? Who do you work for, Ogilvy?

12:29.310 --> 12:31.187
You can't outsell me, so you got me fired?

12:31.187 --> 12:34.440
Just the opposite. I wanna hire you.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.070
Name's Moe Berkus.
I work for the president's office.

12:39.070 --> 12:40.196
Of what company?

12:43.366 --> 12:45.159
The president.

12:48.955 --> 12:54.335
We need a marketing specialist,
and word has it you are the very best.

12:54.961 --> 12:58.840
So I did a little digging, and--

13:00.758 --> 13:03.469
You have quite a colorful past, Kelly.

13:03.469 --> 13:06.347
Or should I call you Jane?
Stewardess from Chicago.

13:06.347 --> 13:11.269
Or perhaps you would prefer Amy,
the nurse from Ohio.

13:11.936 --> 13:14.230
Face like that,
who's gonna check references?

13:15.356 --> 13:18.109
Page you're looking for isn't in there.

13:22.905 --> 13:24.741
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:24.741 --> 13:27.243
Sure you don't. And I get it.

13:27.243 --> 13:32.206
Hey, I have dozens of IDs,
and my real name's not Moe.

13:32.206 --> 13:35.168
With all the names
you could've picked, you landed on Moe?

13:35.168 --> 13:36.711
You have singular talent.

13:36.711 --> 13:41.466
Why waste it selling cars
when you can think bigger?

13:43.301 --> 13:46.304
Well, Moe, what's bigger than Ford?

13:50.558 --> 13:52.852
You ever been to Florida?

13:56.731 --> 13:59.984
- They want you to sell the moon?
- The moon. The Apollo mission.

13:59.984 --> 14:01.569
The whole thing.

14:01.569 --> 14:03.905
And this Moe guy works for NASA?

14:04.572 --> 14:08.451
Yeah. I mean-- Well, no. Kind of.
He works for the government.

14:08.451 --> 14:09.535
Which part?

14:12.288 --> 14:13.289
Kelly?

14:15.416 --> 14:19.295
Does this guy-- Are we working
for Richard Nixon?

14:19.295 --> 14:21.798
Because, Kelly, I will not work
for Richard Nixon.

14:21.798 --> 14:24.842
I'm a card-carrying feminist.
I actually have a card.

14:24.842 --> 14:26.719
I can't even believe he's going
to be president.

14:26.719 --> 14:29.305
I had no idea I disagreed
with this much of the country.

14:29.305 --> 14:33.935
We are working for NASA to sell the moon.
Nobody disagrees about the moon.

14:33.935 --> 14:35.728
No. You and I both know

14:35.728 --> 14:38.898
that everywhere around us every day
something terrible is happening.

14:38.898 --> 14:40.066
Everywhere.

14:40.066 --> 14:41.567
Except in space.

14:41.567 --> 14:44.612
- I hate that this is working on me.
- They definitely need our help.

14:44.612 --> 14:48.866
Did you know of NASA's first 29 missions,
only 48% have been successful?

14:49.492 --> 14:50.868
That can't be. That's crazy.

14:50.868 --> 14:56.958
Did you know the ratio of men to women
in Cocoa Beach is 5-to-1? Wow.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.586
As long as you got us a quiet place
that's not on Frat Row.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.464
The-- The guidebook said it's quaint.

15:16.602 --> 15:17.729
You're fired.

15:18.563 --> 15:19.772
Who are all these people?

15:19.772 --> 15:23.359
It is a Wednesday.
It's like they're on a different planet.

15:23.359 --> 15:24.694
They call it Florida.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.613
Please tell me you booked a room
away from the pool.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.917
- <i>...sixteen and 21...</i>
- <i>Weather!</i>

15:39.917 --> 15:41.919
<i>...Clear to partly cloudy tomorrow.</i>

15:41.919 --> 15:44.672
<i>A few isolated thundershowers
during the afternoon and early evening.</i>

15:44.672 --> 15:46.049
<i>A low tonight, 65 to 75.</i>

15:46.049 --> 15:48.343
<i>Currently 77 in the Moonport cities.</i>

15:48.343 --> 15:51.137
<i>That's KO twenty-twenty news,
sports and weather.</i>

15:51.137 --> 15:52.847
<i>WKKO--</i>

16:02.231 --> 16:04.692
- Hey, Joe.
- Evening, Cole. What'll it be?

16:05.193 --> 16:06.194
Coffee. Black.

16:06.194 --> 16:09.030
And whatever takes the least amount
of time to put in a bag, my friend.

16:43.731 --> 16:45.525
Miss, you're on fire.

16:45.525 --> 16:46.734
Very original.

16:46.734 --> 16:48.903
No, I do not wanna stop,
drop and roll with you.

16:48.903 --> 16:50.279
No, your book is on fire.

16:51.364 --> 16:52.240
God.

16:54.742 --> 16:55.576
Okay.

16:55.576 --> 16:58.079
- All right. All right. All right.
- Oh, my God.

16:58.079 --> 17:00.832
- I'm sorry. Thank you. I just--
- Just as a rule of thumb,

17:00.832 --> 17:03.042
alcohol and flames,
they-- they like each other.

17:03.042 --> 17:06.004
Yeah. Oh, gosh. I ruined your jacket.

17:06.004 --> 17:07.338
No, this thing's seen worse.

17:07.338 --> 17:09.424
- Been through worse.
- Let me buy a drink for your troubles.

17:09.424 --> 17:10.591
- That's not necessary.
- I insist.

17:10.591 --> 17:12.093
I don't drink. It's okay.

17:12.093 --> 17:15.138
Oh, really? An astronaut
who doesn't drink. That's very intriguing.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.932
What makes you think I'm an astronaut?

17:18.433 --> 17:21.227
Because you have an Apollo pin,
and only astronauts get those.

17:21.227 --> 17:23.021
So you know a thing or two about NASA.

17:23.021 --> 17:27.400
Yeah, well, I'm a recent fan.
I'm Kelly Jones.

17:28.775 --> 17:31.195
I'm no astronaut.
I just work at Kennedy. Cole Davis.

17:32.237 --> 17:33.613
Well, what do you do there?

17:35.742 --> 17:38.328
Look, the last thing I want to do
is make small talk about my job.

17:39.411 --> 17:40.580
Sorry. That didn't sound--

17:40.580 --> 17:43.916
- I didn't mean it for it to--
- That's okay. No. You were being honest.

17:43.916 --> 17:45.001
Order up, Cole.

18:12.236 --> 18:14.238
I wasn't being honest.
If I was being honest,

18:14.238 --> 18:16.449
I'd have told you
you're the most beautiful woman

18:16.449 --> 18:18.117
that I've seen in longer
than I can remember,

18:18.117 --> 18:19.702
and I have a very good memory.

18:19.702 --> 18:22.455
All I really want to do is just buy you
a drink and talk to you for hours,

18:22.455 --> 18:25.541
but I can't so I'm trying really hard
to just forget that you're here.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.043
It was nice to meet you, Kelly.

18:28.503 --> 18:29.671
I really am sorry.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.978
Welcome to Rockets Road,

19:26.978 --> 19:30.023
also known as Alligator Alley.

19:30.690 --> 19:34.444
You'll wanna keep your arms and legs
inside the cart

19:34.444 --> 19:36.696
if you wanna keep your arms and legs.

19:38.031 --> 19:42.160
No, that's just a little joke.
They mostly attack in the water.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.581
Now, today's tour will take approximately
two and a half to three hours.

19:46.581 --> 19:48.958
So let's get comfy-cozy.

19:49.709 --> 19:52.962
Now on the right is our testing facility.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.088
State-of-the-art.

19:54.088 --> 19:56.758
- It's on fire.
- It is often on fire.

19:57.467 --> 20:01.429
Up ahead, we have
the vehicle assembly building.

20:01.429 --> 20:04.223
That's where they assemble the rockets.

20:04.223 --> 20:10.897
That is the tallest single-story building
in the world.

20:10.897 --> 20:14.942
You can fit four Statue of Liberties
inside that building.

20:14.942 --> 20:17.070
Wow. <i>Life Magazine</i> really doesn't
do it justice.

20:17.070 --> 20:18.738
This is so gre-- I'd love to go inside.

20:18.738 --> 20:21.741
- It's highly restricted. I'm sorry.
- Come on, let's get a closer look.

20:21.741 --> 20:23.993
Oh, no, no. No. There's no entry here.

20:23.993 --> 20:26.454
You need a special access badge to enter.

20:26.454 --> 20:28.206
Oh, like-- like this one?

20:28.206 --> 20:32.001
Yeah. That's-- Oh, no, no, no,
that's-- that's my badge.

20:32.001 --> 20:34.754
- Hey--
- Look at this place. It's enormous!

20:34.754 --> 20:36.965
- It seems like it's much bigger--
- They took my badge!

20:36.965 --> 20:38.383
I mean, look at this building.

20:38.383 --> 20:40.885
- Hello? That's my badge.
- Hello, sir. Hi.

20:40.885 --> 20:43.346
Kelly Jones from NASA Public Affairs.

20:43.346 --> 20:45.723
Here's our all-access pass for both of us.
Thank you.

20:45.723 --> 20:47.558
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait. My card.

20:52.647 --> 20:54.023
Now, this I can sell.

21:02.949 --> 21:05.076
Hello. Boys, boys!

21:05.076 --> 21:06.786
Hi. Kelly Jones.

21:06.786 --> 21:09.163
I'm from the new NASA Public Affairs team.

21:09.163 --> 21:11.040
Can I ask you two a few questions?

21:11.040 --> 21:12.792
Name, age, and what's your job here?

21:14.210 --> 21:16.129
I'm Stu Bryce.

21:16.129 --> 21:19.048
One of the head engineers, and I'm 24.

21:19.048 --> 21:20.633
- We'll say 35.
- Yeah.

21:20.633 --> 21:21.634
And you?

21:21.634 --> 21:24.512
I'm Don Harper. I work for him,
and I'm 23.

21:25.221 --> 21:26.222
You guys are babies.

21:26.222 --> 21:29.017
The average age at NASA is 26.

21:29.017 --> 21:31.519
But we do know some old people
that work here as well.

21:31.519 --> 21:33.938
- Yeah, like, 32, 33.
- Yeah.

21:33.938 --> 21:36.232
I'll try not to kill both of you
for saying that.

21:36.232 --> 21:39.360
So, tell us, Stu, what brings you to join
this great American mission?

21:39.360 --> 21:42.780
Well, I saw a flyer in my college dorm.

21:43.781 --> 21:45.700
- "A childhood love of the stars."
- That's good.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.076
- That's very moving.
- That's very good.

21:47.076 --> 21:48.453
- And you?
- Excuse me?

21:51.706 --> 21:52.874
What are you doing here?

21:52.874 --> 21:56.169
Well, I-- I tracked you down to give you
my phone number,

21:56.169 --> 21:57.712
'cause I felt we had a connection.

21:58.796 --> 22:01.007
- What?
- Relax. I'm joking.

22:01.007 --> 22:04.552
I work here now. Moe Berkus brought me on
to revamp NASA Public Affairs.

22:04.552 --> 22:07.597
So you're the killer from Manhattan.

22:07.597 --> 22:11.184
And you must be the launch director.
This is my associate, Ruby Martin.

22:11.184 --> 22:14.062
Yeah, I don't care. Look.
This building is completely off-limits.

22:14.062 --> 22:16.064
Everything in here can burn you,
freeze you, fry you,

22:16.064 --> 22:18.066
poison you and crush you.

22:18.066 --> 22:20.526
- So let's go. Out.
- <i>How long have you worked here?</i>

22:20.526 --> 22:23.071
A substantial amount of time.

22:23.655 --> 22:25.239
- What are you writing?
- Your quote.

22:25.239 --> 22:27.784
That's not a quote.
It was just a thing that I said.

22:27.784 --> 22:30.244
I'll punch it up. Do you have time today
for an interview?

22:30.244 --> 22:32.372
And also, I need to sit down
with your senior officers.

22:32.372 --> 22:34.874
- The photogenic types first.
- I can help with the selection process.

22:34.874 --> 22:36.918
Look, my guys are too weird
for interviews,

22:36.918 --> 22:38.795
and they're actually busy
doing life-and-death work.

22:40.296 --> 22:42.507
Well, you know,
I don't need your permission.

22:42.507 --> 22:45.551
The Americans are over their long
and expensive honeymoon in space,

22:45.551 --> 22:48.388
and I'm here to remind them
why they fell in love in the first place.

22:48.388 --> 22:51.933
Is that right?
Well, Americans should be very grateful

22:51.933 --> 22:54.686
that these men are putting their lives
on the line for the mission.

22:54.686 --> 22:58.481
Well, you don't know much
about American people, do you?

22:58.481 --> 23:02.276
You don't know very much about
your office I'm about to show you, do you?

23:09.867 --> 23:11.035
Is this a storage closet?

23:11.536 --> 23:13.705
Nope. Storage closet has a window.

23:13.705 --> 23:16.541
Okay, so, instant coffee
is in the break room.

23:16.541 --> 23:19.127
Just run the tap for a minute
to flush out the rust.

23:19.794 --> 23:23.423
Do either of you know
how to work a fire extinguisher?

23:25.216 --> 23:27.635
No? Mkay. PASS method's pretty simple.

23:27.635 --> 23:30.972
Just pull the pin, aim, squeeze, sweep.

23:30.972 --> 23:33.266
If you need anything else,

23:33.808 --> 23:36.561
maybe just go back to New York
and get it. Have a good day.

23:37.687 --> 23:41.607
- Well, at least he's easy on the eyes.
- He's hard on the ears though.

23:41.607 --> 23:44.193
Not a great welcome wagon.
I thought you said they wanted our help.

23:44.193 --> 23:47.697
Oh, no. I said they needed our help.
And I do believe that now more than ever.

23:47.697 --> 23:50.074
How are we supposed to do that
if we can't talk to anyone

23:50.074 --> 23:51.326
or look at anything?

23:53.745 --> 23:55.496
It's a cat. It's a cat.

23:55.496 --> 23:56.789
- It's a cat!
- It's a cat.

23:56.789 --> 23:58.791
You know what they say about black cats?

23:58.791 --> 24:01.753
If they cross your path,
they're probably going someplace else.

24:02.545 --> 24:05.340
Okay, time to dig out the old Rolodex.

24:06.049 --> 24:08.426
Let's get creative.

24:29.614 --> 24:34.494
Apollo 11 will land our men on the moon,

24:34.494 --> 24:37.246
and that makes us first.

24:37.246 --> 24:40.750
If we do our jobs,
we will launch right from there,

24:40.750 --> 24:43.002
July 16, bright and early.

24:43.544 --> 24:44.629
Between now and then,

24:44.629 --> 24:47.507
we will piece together
the biggest jigsaw puzzle

24:47.507 --> 24:49.592
in the history of mankind.

24:50.385 --> 24:52.470
Six million parts spread out
around the country,

24:52.470 --> 24:55.682
and we will assemble, test,
and retest every single one

24:55.682 --> 24:58.226
until we are certain
that Apollo 11 will take off

24:58.226 --> 25:01.187
without a hitch and head to the moon in--

25:01.771 --> 25:02.772
Henry, sing it.

25:03.564 --> 25:04.983
Seven months.

25:05.733 --> 25:06.943
Seven months.

25:06.943 --> 25:10.488
Please help me congratulate
the astronauts of Apollo 11.

25:11.072 --> 25:14.617
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins.

25:25.461 --> 25:29.340
Hey, hey! How'd you like
the White House, boys?

25:29.340 --> 25:32.510
Yeah, it was all right, except
Neil wouldn't let me steal the china.

25:34.637 --> 25:39.559
All right. Because in eight months,
when this is all over,

25:40.226 --> 25:43.229
and they need new history books to cover
what we've accomplished here,

25:43.229 --> 25:46.190
each and every single one of you
will be able to say that

25:46.190 --> 25:51.112
"I did the hardest thing
that has ever been done." Yeah?

25:51.112 --> 25:52.155
Yeah!

25:52.155 --> 25:54.073
- Let's do it.
- Let's get to it!

25:59.704 --> 26:01.873
- Beautiful. Perfect.
- Thank you.

26:01.873 --> 26:03.791
- Yeah.
- Sir,

26:03.791 --> 26:07.003
you said to tell you when the new lady
did anything you wouldn't like.

26:07.962 --> 26:09.797
<i>I'm here at the Kennedy Space Center</i>

26:09.797 --> 26:12.008
<i>with Deputy Launch Director, Henry Smalls.</i>

26:12.008 --> 26:14.927
What's going on? That's my name.
He's got my name and my job!

26:14.927 --> 26:18.097
<i>It's been a great time for all of us.
You know, for me, this is very personal.</i>

26:18.097 --> 26:19.432
<i>My father was an airman...</i>

26:19.432 --> 26:20.516
Who is that?

26:21.309 --> 26:22.894
- It's not me.
- <i>...he died in the line of duty</i>

26:22.894 --> 26:24.854
- <i>when I was a child...</i>
- I'm not that handsome.

26:24.854 --> 26:26.022
<i>...so this is for you, Dad.</i>

26:26.022 --> 26:27.899
- That's it.
- <i>So sorry to hear that.</i>

26:27.899 --> 26:30.610
- <i>Thanks for sharing. That must've been...</i>
- My dad's still alive.

26:31.653 --> 26:36.699
Right. What is it that we can do
to sort of make 6:00 p.m.? Yeah.

26:37.575 --> 26:39.702
NASA Public Affairs, this is Kelly Jones.

26:39.702 --> 26:42.163
Kelly, ABC wants next week's press reel.

26:42.163 --> 26:44.415
They also want the best photo we have
from the Apollo 8.

26:44.415 --> 26:46.918
Tell them they can have it
if they give us their 6:00 p.m. time slot.

26:46.918 --> 26:49.462
- Got it.
- If you air an animated segment,

26:49.462 --> 26:51.756
- I can offer you an exclusive--
- <i>Thank you so much.</i>

26:51.756 --> 26:54.550
<i>Your father was a hero. You are a hero.
We so appreciate you working at...</i>

26:54.550 --> 26:57.428
- That was the head of NBC News.
- Yeah, I don't care. Who is that?

26:57.428 --> 26:59.555
<i>Thank you. See you on the moon.</i>

27:00.056 --> 27:01.599
To the world, that's Henry Smalls.

27:01.599 --> 27:02.809
That's not Henry Smalls.

27:02.809 --> 27:04.852
No, but you told me
that your guys don't do interviews,

27:04.852 --> 27:06.187
so I had to hire new guys.

27:08.606 --> 27:11.818
You have two of the best engineers
on the planet installing a window.

27:11.818 --> 27:14.487
Phil, if you hammer one more time, I swear
to God I'm gonna lose my mind.

27:14.487 --> 27:16.447
Put down the hammer,
take your stupid belts off

27:16.447 --> 27:17.657
and get back to testing.

27:19.492 --> 27:20.702
On the move. Here we go.

27:20.702 --> 27:22.286
Can you believe that view?

27:22.286 --> 27:24.664
- We got the first photos from Apollo 8.
- It's better than mine.

27:24.664 --> 27:26.582
The first shot of the earth from the moon.

27:26.582 --> 27:29.002
Isn't that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

27:29.002 --> 27:32.130
- How'd you get this before me?
- They're calling it "Earthrise."

27:32.130 --> 27:34.257
It's going to be at the top
of every news segment tonight.

27:34.257 --> 27:36.009
I mean, '68 has been such a terrible year.

27:36.009 --> 27:39.178
Assassinations, this heinous war,
we've seen the worst of humanity.

27:39.178 --> 27:42.432
Now NASA gives us this?
A whole new way to see the world.

27:44.475 --> 27:46.394
And I'm gonna make sure everybody sees it.

27:49.230 --> 27:51.274
You can't just fake people!

27:52.233 --> 27:54.027
Hey, I'm here for the casting.

27:56.237 --> 27:58.906
- Who's he?
- You. You're a juicy part.

27:59.407 --> 28:01.284
So, here's the scenes
and the character bio.

28:01.284 --> 28:03.786
This is the man that you're playing,
so you wanna up the charisma a bit.

28:03.786 --> 28:05.163
- Can do. I'll up the--
- Okay? Okay.

28:05.163 --> 28:07.540
- Sixty missions in Korea?
- Yeah.

28:07.540 --> 28:10.793
- It's an honor.
- I flew 52 missions in Korea.

28:10.793 --> 28:11.878
I rounded up.

28:13.254 --> 28:17.091
"I flew 52 missions in Korea."
How was that?

28:18.426 --> 28:19.761
- What?
- I'll work on it.

28:23.848 --> 28:25.266
She has a fake me now.

28:25.266 --> 28:28.102
- She got a fake me.
- She got a fake me and a fake you.

28:28.102 --> 28:29.729
- You can't fake me and you.
- There's nothing here.

28:29.729 --> 28:32.690
There's no Moe Berkus.
I checked every spelling.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.401
I have a Moe Berkus on the line.

28:38.571 --> 28:41.240
- Do you want me to talk?
- Oh, no, no. I'm gonna enjoy this.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.910
This is gonna be the fastest firing
in NASA's history.

28:43.910 --> 28:47.288
- Hey, Moe.
- Cole, I hear you're looking for me.

28:47.288 --> 28:50.708
I am. Kelly Jones hired actors
to play NASA engineers.

28:50.708 --> 28:54.128
It is unacceptable.
I want her desk cleared today.

28:54.128 --> 28:57.298
Calm, calm, calm down, okay?

28:57.840 --> 29:01.344
Washington watches TV.
Apollo is now on TV.

29:01.886 --> 29:03.596
Every channel, every day.

29:04.681 --> 29:07.266
So, you want to get to the moon?

29:07.266 --> 29:09.560
<i>I suggest, focus on your job.</i>

29:09.560 --> 29:10.937
<i>Let Kelly do hers.</i>

29:11.437 --> 29:14.023
If she's made you the belle of the ball,

29:14.023 --> 29:18.403
why don't you just slip on your tutu
and do some dancing?

29:25.827 --> 29:27.161
She fired?

29:30.289 --> 29:31.582
Are we fired?

29:35.128 --> 29:38.381
<i>Apollo 8, carrying astronauts
Borman, Lovell and Anders</i>

29:38.381 --> 29:40.842
<i>was launched into space by a Saturn V.</i>

29:42.719 --> 29:44.595
Every single network is airing
the Earthrise shot.

29:44.595 --> 29:46.556
I mean, it's-- it's gonna be everywhere.

29:47.724 --> 29:49.475
You know, I tried
a little something on it,

29:49.475 --> 29:52.395
- but I just don't think it's working yet.
- It's not enough. We need a hook,

29:52.395 --> 29:55.064
a way to weave the moon landing
into people's everyday lives

29:55.064 --> 29:56.607
without them realizing it.

29:57.191 --> 29:59.694
Hi. Do you have anything close to a salad?

30:00.236 --> 30:01.279
Pickles come on a burger.

30:01.279 --> 30:04.866
It's gonna be a minute, though.
Apollo news has business picking up.

30:04.866 --> 30:07.744
All the tourists love to come in
and see little pieces of history.

30:08.369 --> 30:11.414
- Pieces of history?
- Yeah, like-- like that pen.

30:11.414 --> 30:14.626
John Glenn ate here every night in '61.

30:14.626 --> 30:17.378
He would work on his flight manuals,
and he'd use one of our pens.

30:17.378 --> 30:19.797
That one ended up on Mercury 6.

30:19.797 --> 30:23.343
You're at the only restaurant in the world
whose name's been in space.

30:25.803 --> 30:27.055
That's cool.

30:32.518 --> 30:34.187
And right up ahead,

30:34.187 --> 30:36.939
it's the famous Mercury rockets.

30:36.939 --> 30:39.942
Be sure to get a picture here,
but don't stand too close.

30:39.942 --> 30:41.361
They might go off.

30:41.361 --> 30:44.113
He recovered after that weekend.

30:50.161 --> 30:52.497
Does it bother you that a room dies
every time you walk into it?

30:52.497 --> 30:54.248
You're supposed to stay on your side.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.042
I missed you.

30:56.042 --> 30:57.794
I'd like you to approve
our new ad campaigns.

30:57.794 --> 30:59.712
Why don't you just sidestep me
like you did last time?

30:59.712 --> 31:02.715
I wanna apologize for blindsiding you
with the interviews.

31:02.715 --> 31:04.425
I have a fix for our money problems.

31:04.425 --> 31:09.263
Well, your apology is rejected,
and so is whatever this is.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.684
- Omega.
- Look, this isn't Madison Avenue.

31:12.684 --> 31:14.852
- We don't pay for this stuff.
- No, it's cost-free.

31:14.852 --> 31:16.813
The brands get a tie-in money can't buy,

31:16.813 --> 31:19.691
and NASA works its way
into the minds of everyday people.

31:19.691 --> 31:22.235
A watch ad? That's your big idea?

31:23.319 --> 31:24.320
Ready?

31:24.821 --> 31:25.822
Toothpaste.

31:27.490 --> 31:31.369
Tang. "The energy breakfast drink
chosen for Apollo astronauts

31:31.369 --> 31:33.663
- on their trip to the moon."
- Moon coupons?

31:33.663 --> 31:36.666
But, my personal favorite,

31:37.834 --> 31:39.752
Fruit of the Loom. Right?

31:39.752 --> 31:42.297
The guys gotta wear something
under those big suits, don't they?

31:42.297 --> 31:43.965
Nothing says NASA like Fruit of the Loom.

31:43.965 --> 31:47.468
Look, I am not turning this ship
into a flying billboard

31:47.468 --> 31:49.387
no matter how much you want it to happen.

31:49.387 --> 31:52.140
And by the way, we don't have time
to test all this before liftoff.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.726
We don't have to send any of this up
into space as long as we say it went.

31:54.726 --> 31:56.144
So you're gonna lie?

31:56.144 --> 31:58.104
It's called selling.
We're not lying to the customer.

31:58.104 --> 32:00.315
- We're changing the way they think.
- No, it's called lying.

32:00.315 --> 32:03.234
Everyone is just a customer to you, huh?

32:03.234 --> 32:06.779
Look, I know that you're a big old fancy
ad shark and everything,

32:06.779 --> 32:09.991
but NASA's not something that you sell
with a jingle and a slogan.

32:09.991 --> 32:12.410
You do not know who we are.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.954
Yeah, okay. Who's Margaret Hamilton?

32:14.954 --> 32:16.998
- Who?
- She works here for you.

32:16.998 --> 32:19.417
There are 400,000 people
that are affiliated

32:19.417 --> 32:21.919
- with this space program, Ms. Jones.
- She's one of your engineers.

32:21.919 --> 32:24.130
- Who's JoAnn Morgan?
- She works in the firing room.

32:24.130 --> 32:27.175
Did you ever ask her why she took this job
in the first place? I have.

32:27.175 --> 32:30.345
She says it's because she has rocket fuel
in her blood.

32:30.345 --> 32:32.513
And NASA's not just a logo, it's people.

32:32.513 --> 32:34.015
People who wake up every morning

32:34.015 --> 32:36.601
and commit to accomplishing
the impossible.

32:36.601 --> 32:39.646
And all while wearing the same underwear
as the rest of us.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.232
Ella, can I help you with anything at all?

32:50.073 --> 32:51.074
Thank you.

32:51.616 --> 32:55.328
So I ran the projections,
and this is what you stand to make

32:55.328 --> 32:57.246
if you accept key sponsorships.

33:01.250 --> 33:02.543
We can't take private money.

33:03.169 --> 33:04.379
It doesn't matter, okay?

33:04.379 --> 33:06.172
I'm about to make NASA so popular

33:06.172 --> 33:09.008
that Congress will finally
turn the taps back on around here.

33:09.008 --> 33:12.637
And all I have to do is just let Armstrong
put on an Omega watch?

33:12.637 --> 33:15.181
No. If we get the money flowing,

33:15.181 --> 33:17.684
then you've gotta prove to me

33:17.684 --> 33:20.019
that Cocoa Beach has a decent place
to get dinner.

33:26.401 --> 33:28.569
- Deal. I--
- Yes! Deal! Yes!

33:29.612 --> 33:33.741
No, wait. I'm drawing the line
at toilet paper though,

33:33.741 --> 33:36.703
because the world does not get to know
what our guys wipe their ass with.

33:36.703 --> 33:38.579
Well, shit.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.461
Would you like to go for
a vacation when you come back to earth?

33:45.461 --> 33:48.131
The situation being what it is now,

33:48.131 --> 33:50.550
the place I would most like to go--

33:51.092 --> 33:53.052
Lose the table next time, Walter.

33:53.052 --> 33:55.805
Neil looks like he's giving
GE's quarterly profit report.

33:55.805 --> 33:57.557
That's always been our table--

33:57.557 --> 33:59.434
TV brings them in
to people's living rooms.

33:59.434 --> 34:01.019
They should look like they belong there.

34:01.019 --> 34:02.437
It'd mean that we succeeded.

34:04.439 --> 34:06.691
You're still in charge, Walter.
Don't you worry.

34:07.233 --> 34:08.735
When I'm done helping though,

34:08.735 --> 34:10.862
those men are gonna be
bigger than The Beatles.

34:10.862 --> 34:14.490
I'm getting to go 99.9% of the way there,
and that suits me just fine.

34:25.168 --> 34:30.006
- What's the name of that VP at Kellogg's?
- I believe it's Harrison Driscoll.

34:30.839 --> 34:31.758
All right, Harrison.

34:31.758 --> 34:36.304
So instead of "Snap, Crackle, Pop,"
"Neil, Buzz and Mike." It's cute, right?

34:39.681 --> 34:40.683
Cole!

34:45.730 --> 34:47.940
- Make sure that doesn't rust, Henry.
- Can you mark these?

34:52.904 --> 34:54.279
- Hey, hey.
- Did you see that?

34:54.279 --> 34:55.448
You didn't see the cat?

34:58.451 --> 34:59.951
Go closer on the Tang bottle.

34:59.951 --> 35:02.955
Make the font bigger
and put bacon with the eggs.

35:02.955 --> 35:05.375
Let's not forget,
we're selling America, here.

35:07.168 --> 35:10.337
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter. Peanut butter
that's out-of-this-world smooth."

35:11.422 --> 35:13.716
"Hasselblad.
See the world the way they do."

35:13.716 --> 35:15.802
Larry, this is Omega's big chance.

35:15.802 --> 35:18.680
On the back of every Speedmaster
till the end of time,

35:20.556 --> 35:23.393
"The first watch worn
on the moon." Right?

35:23.393 --> 35:25.061
Now we just gotta stand her up.

35:25.853 --> 35:27.313
It's all gonna be worth it.

35:35.571 --> 35:39.534
- Hey. Hey! You're in my spot.
- We're setting up a shot for Kelly.

35:50.461 --> 35:54.090
We've got three astronauts
on the Apollo 11 mission.

35:54.090 --> 35:57.760
There they are in front of
three beautiful American cars.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.012
Oh, this is great.

35:59.012 --> 36:00.555
You gotta be
in the test facility right now.

36:00.555 --> 36:01.514
Talk to Kelly.

36:01.514 --> 36:03.391
Kelly said we could
take a Corvette home for a dollar.

36:03.391 --> 36:04.434
- There you are.
- A dollar?

36:04.434 --> 36:06.185
I'm gonna need them
for 15 minutes, but that's all.

36:06.185 --> 36:08.271
I needed them 15 minutes ago, Kelly.

36:08.271 --> 36:10.565
You know how expensive those suits are?

36:11.316 --> 36:14.944
Don't worry.
It's just the launch director.

36:14.944 --> 36:17.989
<i>This strange looking bird,
the LEM, Mr. Kelly. How does it work?</i>

36:17.989 --> 36:20.283
<i>Well, this is a spacecraft that's used</i>

36:20.283 --> 36:22.243
<i>to take men down to the lunar surface.</i>

36:22.994 --> 36:25.747
<i>And two of the three astronauts
in the LEM...</i>

36:29.959 --> 36:33.546
Flight, we missed target
and are drifting into the vast abyss.

36:36.924 --> 36:39.052
- And we're dead. Again.
- Yeah.

36:39.052 --> 36:41.220
Ran out of fuel 30 seconds
before touchdown.

36:41.220 --> 36:42.513
Yeah, but the landing, though,

36:42.513 --> 36:44.432
- it was smooth-- It was good.
- Great pitch. Forward.

36:44.432 --> 36:45.892
You're both bad liars.

36:45.892 --> 36:49.479
Neil, Mike, Buzz, if I can get
one more photo for Ms. Jones and Omega?

36:49.479 --> 36:50.563
Who are you, man?

36:53.775 --> 36:55.443
All right, watches up, boys.

36:55.943 --> 36:57.779
And smile for Omega.

37:05.244 --> 37:07.538
- Davis.
- Am I interrupting?

37:08.081 --> 37:11.793
- Always.
- There should be a box in front of you.

37:11.793 --> 37:13.336
<i>Why don't you open it?</i>

37:17.715 --> 37:20.134
Omega thanks you for your service.

37:20.134 --> 37:22.887
<i>Your boys are all over TV,</i>

37:22.887 --> 37:28.893
the taps are flowing again. So... dinner?

37:30.853 --> 37:33.898
Yeah. Canaveral Pier. Five o'clock.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.441
Wear your watch.

37:37.193 --> 37:40.363
3:00 p.m. is their best
and final time slot to air the interview.

37:40.363 --> 37:43.700
For an exclusive with Armstrong?
3:00 p.m. is for children and deadbeats.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.202
They said they have breaking news
from the war.

37:48.371 --> 37:50.248
<i>Unknown size enemy force.</i>

37:50.248 --> 37:52.625
<i>Enemy casualties are unknown,</i>

37:52.625 --> 37:54.335
<i>but you've seen how it really was.</i>

37:54.335 --> 37:56.462
So much for keeping Apollo back
in the news cycle.

37:56.462 --> 37:58.923
<i>Heroism, danger, fear,
all rolled into one.</i>

37:58.923 --> 38:00.675
<i>Words don't describe it.</i>

38:00.675 --> 38:04.095
<i>Richard Threlkeld, CBS News.
Near the Cambodian border.</i>

38:08.433 --> 38:10.351
Thank you, Captain Scotty. Appreciate you.

38:11.311 --> 38:12.312
Okay.

38:12.312 --> 38:14.230
Well, you spare no expense on a lady.

38:14.230 --> 38:15.648
Just try it.

38:15.648 --> 38:17.108
Shrimp, mayo, bun.

38:17.108 --> 38:19.861
And that happens to be the best meal
in a hundred miles.

38:25.033 --> 38:26.034
Told you.

38:26.617 --> 38:28.745
How'd I not know about this place?

38:29.245 --> 38:30.788
Not everybody likes to advertise.

38:32.165 --> 38:33.207
Nice one. That's good.

38:39.213 --> 38:41.215
That's where the rocket will launch
out of. Right there.

38:46.095 --> 38:48.806
That watch looks great on you.
You wear it very well.

38:52.185 --> 38:53.186
Thanks.

38:57.398 --> 38:59.859
That night at the bar,
what I said to you--

38:59.859 --> 39:01.486
That you couldn't take your eyes off me,

39:01.486 --> 39:03.863
and I was the most beautiful woman
that you'd ever seen?

39:03.863 --> 39:06.240
Yeah, that part. That-- Yes.

39:06.949 --> 39:08.493
It was impulsive.

39:08.493 --> 39:11.454
It was meant for a stranger,
and we're working together now.

39:11.454 --> 39:13.873
So, I just don't want you
to think that I was--

39:13.873 --> 39:14.957
Interested?

39:17.251 --> 39:18.670
I just wanted to clear the air.

39:20.046 --> 39:21.172
Well, the air was clear.

39:21.839 --> 39:22.840
Good.

39:30.223 --> 39:31.474
I had a thought.

39:31.474 --> 39:33.101
Yeah. It was perfect for 30 seconds.

39:33.101 --> 39:35.269
What are the networks covering
night and day?

39:35.812 --> 39:37.397
You think I have time to watch TV?

39:37.939 --> 39:41.192
Vietnam. They're broadcasting
straight from the action.

39:41.192 --> 39:43.027
And people don't want
to just hear the news anymore.

39:43.027 --> 39:44.988
They wanna see it in the making.

39:45.655 --> 39:46.656
Okay.

39:53.162 --> 39:54.956
Why not let 'em?

39:56.374 --> 39:58.793
You want to put
a live television camera on the LEM?

39:58.793 --> 40:00.044
Yes.

40:00.044 --> 40:01.671
My guys are trying to survive up there.

40:01.671 --> 40:03.631
They don't have time to figure out
how to film a movie.

40:03.631 --> 40:06.134
We'll figure it out for 'em.
All they have to do is point and shoot.

40:06.134 --> 40:08.511
You don't get it.
It's a logistical nightmare.

40:08.511 --> 40:11.264
There's power issues, storage, weight.

40:11.264 --> 40:13.182
There's not even a camera
that would work up there

40:13.182 --> 40:16.728
'cause it's negative 200 degrees at night
and over 250 degrees during the daytime.

40:17.312 --> 40:18.813
Can you imagine seeing it?

40:19.522 --> 40:21.983
No. I just said it's impossible.

40:21.983 --> 40:23.735
Yes. That's the point.

40:23.735 --> 40:25.820
It would be
the greatest televised event ever.

40:25.820 --> 40:27.530
Do you think this is a game show?

40:28.156 --> 40:29.824
There is a very good reason

40:29.824 --> 40:32.660
why the Soviets aren't broadcasting
their space walks.

40:32.660 --> 40:34.704
Because they're
a tight-lipped dictatorship.

40:34.704 --> 40:35.997
- Yeah, that's not us.
- Wow.

40:35.997 --> 40:38.041
When we succeed, we do it as a nation.

40:38.041 --> 40:40.418
- And when we fail, we grieve as a nation.
- Right.

40:40.418 --> 40:42.211
That's what it means to be American.

40:42.211 --> 40:44.756
Stop telling me what it means
to be an American.

40:44.756 --> 40:47.967
There's only one of us here that has
served their country their entire life.

40:51.596 --> 40:53.806
I'm sorry. We're not putting
the camera on the LEM.

40:59.562 --> 41:00.855
I mean it. We're not.

41:03.066 --> 41:04.067
We are.

41:10.573 --> 41:12.533
There's no way he can do it
without more fuel.

41:16.579 --> 41:18.206
- Have him run it again.
- Yeah.

41:25.088 --> 41:27.298
Okay. I'm on a tight schedule. What is it?

41:27.298 --> 41:31.260
Kelly briefed me on the camera idea,
and we like it.

41:31.260 --> 41:33.221
We like it a lot.

41:33.221 --> 41:35.556
She misspoke. We can't do it.

41:36.140 --> 41:38.518
There is no such technology
that even exists.

41:38.518 --> 41:40.144
Actually it does. You know?

41:40.728 --> 41:43.898
The Department of Defense designed this

41:43.898 --> 41:47.318
to find downed fighter pilots
in Vietnam at night.

41:47.318 --> 41:51.948
Now, it's classified
but the DOD is going to let you use it

41:51.948 --> 41:53.783
as long as nobody knows what it is.

41:53.783 --> 41:55.952
There's absolutely no space
for equipment that heavy.

41:55.952 --> 41:57.704
We are weighing screws for God's sake.

41:57.704 --> 41:59.580
What-- I mean, what is this, 15 pounds?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.457
Okay. So, just, like, lighter screws.

42:01.457 --> 42:03.376
We're trying for another fuel cell.

42:03.376 --> 42:08.172
So our men, when they get to the moon,
they still have enough fuel to lift off.

42:08.172 --> 42:11.342
Out of all her bad ideas,
this one is the worst.

42:12.427 --> 42:14.846
Actually, the president loves it.

42:14.846 --> 42:17.432
So, now it's a great idea.

42:17.432 --> 42:20.143
So, let me put it to you simply, Cole.

42:20.143 --> 42:22.895
Find a way to put this on that.

42:22.895 --> 42:25.815
This is an order. From the tippy top.

42:37.577 --> 42:40.038
Don, Stu. Can you come in here, please?

42:43.583 --> 42:46.586
Thank you. Let's not make
everything so hard.

42:48.921 --> 42:52.175
Please help Miss Jones strip
this top secret camera down.

42:52.175 --> 42:54.344
I don't want 'em to know it's top secret.

42:54.344 --> 42:55.428
Well, now they do.

42:55.428 --> 42:57.263
Please strip this top secret camera.

42:57.263 --> 43:00.099
Mount it onto the LEM
for live broadcasting.

43:01.809 --> 43:04.354
Cole. One last thing.

43:04.354 --> 43:09.317
Last week, a CIA spy plane took
some surveillance photographs

43:09.317 --> 43:12.111
of the new Russian N1 rocket.

43:12.111 --> 43:13.821
And Congress saw it,

43:13.821 --> 43:16.699
and some of the members
are having cold feet

43:16.699 --> 43:19.369
about the final round of funding.

43:19.369 --> 43:21.287
We're months away from winning this thing.

43:21.287 --> 43:23.039
I'm gonna send them down here,

43:23.039 --> 43:25.291
and you're gonna convince them
to sit tight.

43:26.084 --> 43:28.252
No. I'm-- I'm gonna write up
some talking points.

43:37.637 --> 43:39.764
Don't take it personally.

43:39.764 --> 43:43.309
Pilots fight gravity.
It's part of their nature.

44:05.456 --> 44:06.457
Henry?

44:11.713 --> 44:13.673
Well, I'm-- I'm glad you're not Cole.

44:14.340 --> 44:15.174
Yeah.

44:15.174 --> 44:16.926
He don't like me smoking.

44:16.926 --> 44:18.928
What, are you worried
he's gonna ground you?

44:21.764 --> 44:26.269
No. I...
I had emergency bypass surgery last year.

44:26.269 --> 44:29.814
Yeah. That son of a bitch.
He's hell-bent on keeping me alive.

44:29.814 --> 44:31.524
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

44:32.317 --> 44:33.443
Yeah. Nobody here does.

44:33.443 --> 44:34.736
Just Cole.

44:35.445 --> 44:40.116
Yeah. He came to the hospital
and held my wife's hand for three days.

44:42.327 --> 44:44.829
Yeah. It's a long way from the day we met.

44:48.124 --> 44:49.876
Kid had just got back from Korea.

44:51.127 --> 44:53.254
The top pilot in the Air Force.

44:54.088 --> 44:56.507
Silver Star. Flying Cross.

44:57.675 --> 45:01.304
He was first in line at Edwards
when they were looking for astronauts.

45:01.304 --> 45:04.974
But he ended up not making the cut.

45:07.435 --> 45:10.480
So, what got him? It was his temper.

45:12.607 --> 45:14.484
No, no. His heart.

45:14.484 --> 45:15.860
Doc found an A-fib.

45:15.860 --> 45:20.156
A little thing but enough to keep him
out of the program.

45:21.741 --> 45:24.661
Cole Davis is the best pilot
who will never get to space.

45:39.133 --> 45:43.304
You know, I've been looking at this view
every day for the last 15 years.

45:44.347 --> 45:48.184
But lately, it's like
I'm seeing it for the first time.

45:50.853 --> 45:54.649
Apollo 1 cast a big shadow on this place.

45:57.694 --> 46:00.697
It's nice to have some light back.

46:04.283 --> 46:05.284
Okay.

46:09.580 --> 46:12.208
Hey, I keep seeing Cole drive out there
every night.

46:14.585 --> 46:15.586
What's he doing?

46:19.590 --> 46:20.591
Gardening.

47:40.922 --> 47:43.299
- You ready?
- Yeah.

47:50.556 --> 47:52.892
All right. Look, we just--
We give the senator a tour.

47:52.892 --> 47:56.354
We play nice for 30 minutes.
We keep the lights on.

47:57.271 --> 47:58.564
Okay. Fine.

47:59.899 --> 48:01.609
- What?
- She's just there.

48:01.609 --> 48:02.777
- Don't run.
- No, no.

48:02.777 --> 48:04.779
- Just don't run. Don't--
- Wait. Shut up.

48:05.655 --> 48:06.781
No. See, you scared it.

48:06.781 --> 48:07.865
I just ate.

48:12.996 --> 48:14.789
Henry, come on! Come on!

48:21.462 --> 48:22.672
I hate that cat.

48:23.339 --> 48:25.091
I see what you mean.

48:25.091 --> 48:28.636
- That's an asshole cat.
- Did you see the look it gave me?

48:28.636 --> 48:30.346
It's just taunting me now.

48:31.472 --> 48:33.850
- What is that?
- That's cat food.

48:33.850 --> 48:36.102
- Somebody's feeding that thing.
- Who's doing that?

48:36.102 --> 48:38.980
Find them. Find them immediately,
and fire them immediately.

48:38.980 --> 48:41.566
Mr. Davis. Sir, Senator Hopp is here.

48:41.566 --> 48:43.276
All right. What? You look fine.

48:43.276 --> 48:44.360
Senator.

48:44.944 --> 48:46.738
- Hello, Mr. Davis.
- Senator. What an honor.

48:46.738 --> 48:49.574
- It's an honor and a pleasure.
- Very nice to see you.

48:52.368 --> 48:54.370
Well, the Apollo 11 capsule has arrived,

48:54.370 --> 48:57.832
and next week, we will be attaching it
to the Saturn V rocket.

48:57.832 --> 49:01.085
And that gets us off the ground
and out of earth's atmosphere.

49:02.045 --> 49:05.840
Well, that's all very impressive,
but I have to be up-front.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.135
Georgia had some devastating floods
this year.

49:09.135 --> 49:12.472
And I'm voting to put this money
toward our relief fund.

49:12.472 --> 49:14.432
That seems a little selfish,
don't you think?

49:15.058 --> 49:16.976
- Excuse me?
- That's a figure of speech.

49:16.976 --> 49:19.604
- Here's what he means.
- My voters mostly think

49:19.604 --> 49:22.231
we are overspending on the moon.

49:22.231 --> 49:23.858
That's funny, because--

49:23.858 --> 49:25.943
Excuse me. Senator Hopp.

49:25.943 --> 49:28.363
You probably don't remember me,

49:28.363 --> 49:31.532
but you spoke
at my sophomore year of college.

49:31.532 --> 49:33.701
Georgia Tech. '55.

49:33.701 --> 49:34.952
You're a Buzz?

49:34.952 --> 49:37.080
- Yes, sir.
- Of course I remember.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.290
Your words inspired me that day.

49:39.290 --> 49:43.211
You said, "Commitment means
staying loyal to a cause."

49:43.211 --> 49:46.881
Two years later, I graduated with honors.
Now I run this department.

49:47.423 --> 49:50.134
You know, in '62 you said
that you would fight

49:50.134 --> 49:53.179
for Kennedy's dream no matter what.

49:53.179 --> 49:56.224
I know that the moon mission
was more popular back then,

49:56.224 --> 49:59.435
but it would be just a shame

50:00.353 --> 50:03.940
if the man whose words inspired me
to work at NASA

50:04.607 --> 50:06.776
didn't live by those very same words.

50:08.695 --> 50:12.865
- It would be a shame, wouldn't it?
- Sir, you are just such a wonderful man.

50:12.865 --> 50:14.033
Thank you so much.

50:14.033 --> 50:15.410
You are a wonderful man.

50:15.410 --> 50:17.495
Isn't she just
a wonderful Georgia peach here?

50:17.495 --> 50:18.579
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

50:18.579 --> 50:20.748
- You are so sweet.
- Yes, I am.

50:20.748 --> 50:24.752
Let me take you on the special VIP tour
they didn't tell you about.

50:24.752 --> 50:26.713
- I'd love that.
- Wonderful.

50:26.713 --> 50:28.715
Do you go on this tour with me?

50:28.715 --> 50:30.258
I absolutely will.

50:30.258 --> 50:31.884
That's so sweet.

50:31.884 --> 50:33.803
She teared up. I mean, it's scary.

50:35.638 --> 50:36.639
Wave and smile.

50:38.016 --> 50:39.017
Bye-bye!

50:41.561 --> 50:45.398
<i>The space program is not only
a bloated mess,</i>

50:45.398 --> 50:49.402
<i>but Apollo flies in the face
of our creator</i>

50:49.402 --> 50:53.614
<i>and the true father of this country.
I would remind you that we don't--</i>

50:53.614 --> 50:58.578
We landed Hopp. We need two more votes.
Looks like it's not gonna be Vanning.

50:58.578 --> 51:02.206
- Definitely not Vanning.
- Next, we have Senator Cook.

51:02.206 --> 51:04.042
Cook's a little scary. I'm not gonna lie.

51:04.042 --> 51:05.918
He's a Cold War conservative.

51:05.918 --> 51:10.757
He's worried that our budget takes away
from weapons development at the DOD.

51:12.258 --> 51:14.302
Now, Senator, with the N1 rocket,

51:14.302 --> 51:16.721
the Russians still could land on the moon
before us.

51:16.721 --> 51:18.765
What we're about to show you
is our most recent intel

51:18.765 --> 51:20.767
on what they plan to build if they do.

51:27.023 --> 51:28.316
- And these are photos?
- No, sir.

51:28.316 --> 51:31.402
Those are, renderings
of a possible future.

51:31.402 --> 51:32.945
Future photos?

51:36.157 --> 51:37.158
Is that a laser?

51:37.158 --> 51:39.035
It's going towards earth, sir.

51:39.035 --> 51:42.872
- What are they calling it?
- "Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator," sir.

51:43.748 --> 51:46.000
- "Killer Lunar Laser Eliminator"?
- Yes, sir.

51:47.710 --> 51:48.711
Damn it. That's good.

51:48.711 --> 51:51.172
And, finally, we have Senator Hedges.

51:51.172 --> 51:53.424
Now, he's always been a fan of Apollo,

51:53.424 --> 51:57.136
but he's getting pressure
from his state party not to fund.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.348
He can't take in oxygen
without a camera pointed at him,

52:00.348 --> 52:03.267
and we're about to have
a few of those around here.

52:03.851 --> 52:05.019
Any questions?

52:05.019 --> 52:06.104
No, ma'am.

52:06.813 --> 52:08.398
Well, let's get him then.

52:10.358 --> 52:11.651
Hello, everyone!

52:16.406 --> 52:17.490
Gentlemen.

52:17.490 --> 52:20.618
It's-- It's-- It's great
to be back, everyone.

52:20.618 --> 52:23.871
You know how much I love
the Apollo program.

52:28.042 --> 52:30.712
Senator. Apollo 10 will just be
orbiting the moon.

52:30.712 --> 52:34.299
But it's gonna get us information critical
for the touchdown of 11.

52:34.299 --> 52:36.592
- Like landing conditions and location.
- Amazing.

52:36.592 --> 52:39.095
And we've a special seat for you here,
Senator, amongst your fans.

52:39.095 --> 52:40.680
For me? Thank you.

52:41.347 --> 52:42.974
<i>Apollo launch control,</i>

52:42.974 --> 52:44.726
<i>and we are go on the countdown</i>

52:44.726 --> 52:47.895
<i>for the Apollo 10 lunar mission
at this time.</i>

52:51.566 --> 52:53.401
We have ignition sequence start.

52:53.901 --> 52:57.280
Five, four, three, two...

52:58.448 --> 53:00.241
All engines running.

53:08.875 --> 53:10.627
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

53:10.627 --> 53:12.754
Forty-nine minutes past the hour.

53:13.254 --> 53:15.340
Tower clear. Tower clear.

53:16.049 --> 53:17.216
Houston, she's all yours.

53:41.866 --> 53:45.453
Glorious launch. Can't wait to be
right back here for Apollo 11.

53:45.453 --> 53:48.039
We cannot thank you enough
for your support, Senator.

53:48.039 --> 53:50.375
It's gonna cost you
more than a pair of binoculars.

53:50.375 --> 53:53.920
I owe a favor
to the news fellas back home.

53:54.629 --> 53:57.632
I'd like you to give them
an on-camera interview.

53:57.632 --> 54:01.010
Senator, I'm the very last person
that you want in front of a camera.

54:01.010 --> 54:03.096
I-- I don't do interviews.

54:03.096 --> 54:06.391
Except for you, Senator Hedges.
We would be delighted.

54:07.976 --> 54:08.977
Smart lady.

54:09.936 --> 54:11.604
- Good night.
- Good night.

54:14.649 --> 54:15.650
Kelly?

54:16.734 --> 54:17.735
It's okay.

54:18.945 --> 54:20.613
Got it all under control.

54:48.433 --> 54:50.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:50.935 --> 54:52.812
You're entitled to a night off too,
you know.

54:54.564 --> 54:56.316
If I am, it's to sleep.

54:57.233 --> 54:58.443
You actually have a house?

54:58.443 --> 55:00.153
I thought you slept at the office.

55:00.153 --> 55:04.240
Well, yeah. Usually. But... Well,
I mean, sometimes I sleep with Jenny.

55:04.824 --> 55:08.036
Oh, yeah. Right. I'm sure she's great.

55:09.287 --> 55:10.747
Jenny? Yeah. She-- She is.

55:14.167 --> 55:15.168
You wanna meet her?

55:15.918 --> 55:17.629
- Yeah.
- Yeah. She'll love you. Come on.

55:28.931 --> 55:30.308
Jenny.

55:30.308 --> 55:31.684
Jenny, this is Kelly.

55:31.684 --> 55:33.102
Kelly, meet Jenny.

55:34.103 --> 55:36.230
She's just like the one I flew in the war.

55:36.230 --> 55:40.193
Keep her here so I can get my flight hours
on the weekends. Saves time.

55:43.029 --> 55:44.322
She's quite a lady.

55:44.864 --> 55:46.824
Yeah. She is.

55:49.077 --> 55:51.579
- Wanna go up?
- No.

55:51.579 --> 55:52.664
- You sure?
- Yeah.

55:54.415 --> 55:55.416
Okay. Come on.

55:56.459 --> 55:57.794
Show you the second-best view.

56:12.892 --> 56:15.186
- You see those dark parts there?
- Yeah.

56:15.186 --> 56:16.980
We call them the seas.

56:17.563 --> 56:19.983
The gravity is stronger in the seas, so...

56:19.983 --> 56:23.611
We've looked to land in, pretty much
every single one of them.

56:23.611 --> 56:25.697
You got the Sea of Serenity.

56:25.697 --> 56:28.825
Sea of Crises. We crossed that one
off the list pretty quick.

56:28.825 --> 56:30.535
Yeah. That's bad PR.

56:30.535 --> 56:34.664
And then we finally settled on,
the Sea of Tranquility.

56:34.664 --> 56:36.082
That's the sweet spot.

56:38.334 --> 56:42.755
You know, come to think about it,
I-- I know a lot more about the moon

56:42.755 --> 56:45.133
than I know about you by a long shot.

56:46.718 --> 56:48.261
I don't even know where you're from.

56:50.638 --> 56:51.639
Kansas.

56:54.183 --> 56:55.310
Kelly from Kansas.

56:56.311 --> 56:58.771
How'd you get into advertising,
Kelly from Kansas?

57:00.189 --> 57:06.279
Well, I was four when my dad left,
and my mom lost the house.

57:06.279 --> 57:07.572
We lived in a car.

57:08.114 --> 57:12.910
And a church gave her a job
selling cookie tins.

57:12.910 --> 57:19.083
So, she had this idea that we'd sell more
if it was me going door-to-door.

57:19.083 --> 57:21.252
Oh, yeah. Smart lady.

57:23.254 --> 57:27.717
Cookie tins, then it was vacuums,
then beauty goods when I got older.

57:27.717 --> 57:30.887
Yeah. Traveling the country,
me and my mom.

57:30.887 --> 57:33.264
It's how we got back on our feet.

57:36.017 --> 57:37.769
Well, I'm sorry you went through that.

57:41.356 --> 57:43.358
Well, don't be. I...

57:45.526 --> 57:47.528
Yeah. I learned early on how to survive.

57:49.947 --> 57:54.160
Plus, we all have our share
of tough breaks.

57:58.081 --> 58:01.250
Henry told me about the A-fib
and you getting kicked out of the program.

58:03.544 --> 58:05.672
I'm gonna have to have
a little conversation with Henry.

58:10.134 --> 58:12.303
You know, I don't totally agree
with you though.

58:15.723 --> 58:18.267
- How's that?
- Well, I just don't--

58:19.185 --> 58:22.230
I don't think that our sad stories
are supposed to

58:22.230 --> 58:23.940
teach us how to survive the world.

58:24.524 --> 58:27.694
I think they're supposed to
make us wanna change it.

58:29.821 --> 58:31.030
Cole!

58:31.739 --> 58:34.325
Buzz is trying to hot-wire your Camaro!

58:35.159 --> 58:36.869
Come on, man.

58:37.829 --> 58:38.830
Well...

58:39.914 --> 58:41.332
You better go stop him.

58:43.251 --> 58:44.252
Yeah.

59:07.692 --> 59:08.735
Jesus!

59:09.652 --> 59:10.653
We need to talk.

59:14.282 --> 59:18.119
You have done outstanding work, Kel.

59:18.703 --> 59:20.538
Public interest is way up.

59:21.331 --> 59:25.335
You landed the senators
and secured the launch.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.004
And that's why you
broke into my motel room?

59:28.004 --> 59:29.255
As a thank you?

59:29.255 --> 59:31.674
Now that we know
the whole world will be watching,

59:31.674 --> 59:33.843
we can't afford to lose.

59:34.510 --> 59:40.183
We need to be prepared
to present an alternate version

59:40.183 --> 59:41.768
of the moon landing.

59:43.061 --> 59:44.145
An alternate version?

59:44.145 --> 59:47.523
The... Artemis version.

59:48.816 --> 59:53.029
She was the twin sister of Apollo,
you know, the backup.

59:53.029 --> 59:57.533
So we just need to be ready
to shoot a little picture.

59:57.533 --> 01:00:02.163
Something showing us, you know,
up there walking around,

01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:03.956
waving at the camera.

01:00:03.956 --> 01:00:07.168
- You mean, to fake it?
- All goes well, we never use it.

01:00:08.378 --> 01:00:09.420
But if not...

01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.511
You know why I never went to prison?

01:00:16.511 --> 01:00:20.223
Probably, but humor me.

01:00:20.223 --> 01:00:21.808
'Cause I quit while I'm ahead.

01:00:22.433 --> 01:00:24.936
Can't keep a secret this big.
Thousands of people work here.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:31.859
Well, thousands of people work
at a classified location in the desert

01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:35.989
that experiments
on a fleet of extraterrestrial pods

01:00:35.989 --> 01:00:38.449
that we found at the bottom of the ocean.

01:00:38.449 --> 01:00:41.119
And you never heard about that, did ya?

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:44.080
Come on, that's not true.

01:00:45.498 --> 01:00:48.293
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

01:00:48.293 --> 01:00:51.129
But the one thing you can be sure of

01:00:51.129 --> 01:00:57.260
is that the world will watch Americans
plant an American flag on the moon.

01:00:58.094 --> 01:01:01.180
And you are telling me
that President Nixon supports this?

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.517
He probably would.
He doesn't know about it

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.815
in the same way that Cole Davis
will never know about it.

01:01:10.815 --> 01:01:12.608
And that shouldn't be a problem

01:01:12.608 --> 01:01:16.279
considering what else
you haven't shared with him

01:01:16.946 --> 01:01:18.990
while you've grown closer.

01:01:20.116 --> 01:01:22.577
I mean, what would a clean-cut
guy like that think about--

01:01:22.577 --> 01:01:23.870
You made your point.

01:01:24.537 --> 01:01:27.206
No one can outrun their past.

01:01:27.206 --> 01:01:31.169
But I can make it go away. Forever.

01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:33.046
No more running.

01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:41.638
I'm gonna need my assistant.

01:01:44.098 --> 01:01:45.308
Of course.

01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:49.228
And we'll get you a team of secure agents.

01:01:49.228 --> 01:01:54.859
Now, who's the best director you've got
that no one's ever heard of?

01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:00.406
You're gonna love him.

01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:04.577
This is the most remote
hangar on the base.

01:02:04.577 --> 01:02:07.246
No one can go in or out
without my permission.

01:02:07.747 --> 01:02:09.749
Wait, no one? Not even Cole?

01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:12.418
Especially not Cole.

01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:18.091
Unbelievable, Kelly.

01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:20.468
You have me forced onto a plane,

01:02:20.468 --> 01:02:22.220
and brought to godforsaken Florida!

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.763
Do you mind?

01:02:23.763 --> 01:02:26.432
I'm a member of the DGA.

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:28.810
I will not be treated this way.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.771
- I am calling my agent.
- You can't.

01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:32.855
Watch me.

01:02:32.855 --> 01:02:36.275
Remember we talked about this.
This is a high-security government job.

01:02:37.193 --> 01:02:39.404
- I'm doubling your quote.
- Okay.

01:02:39.404 --> 01:02:40.571
With a bonus.

01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:45.410
Yes. The only caveat being that
no one can ever know what we're doing.

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:47.578
- I cannot accept that.
- They will shoot you.

01:02:48.371 --> 01:02:49.372
What is my budget?

01:02:49.372 --> 01:02:55.128
Your budget is whatever it costs
to turn this into the moon

01:02:55.128 --> 01:02:56.713
for two-and-a-half hours.

01:02:57.297 --> 01:02:58.631
It's shorter than <i>Ben-Hur</i>.

01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:16.691
I will need a fridge
full of Tab over there.

01:03:18.609 --> 01:03:21.612
And an army of minions
who don't ask questions.

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:35.710
Kelly, these aren't real actors.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:37.920
Well, this is the best you're gonna get.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.922
Neil's 5'11". Anybody 5'11"?

01:03:40.673 --> 01:03:42.300
Okay. The rest of you are dismissed.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.344
- Take your pick.
- Hold on. You.

01:03:44.344 --> 01:03:45.678
You're gonna be my personal assistant.

01:03:45.678 --> 01:03:48.056
I'll just call you Joseph
so you can't take things personally.

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:49.349
Go stand somewhere.

01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:51.643
All right. Can we
take these sunglasses off, please,

01:03:51.643 --> 01:03:54.604
so I can see your eyes
and believe your truth?

01:03:54.604 --> 01:03:56.397
Now, I want each of you to do a monologue.

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:59.609
Preferably something classical,
and by God,

01:03:59.609 --> 01:04:01.235
don't make me watch seven Hamlets.

01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:03.321
You're not gonna see their faces.
They're wearing helmets.

01:04:03.321 --> 01:04:04.405
Wh--

01:04:06.282 --> 01:04:09.577
All right, how do I convey

01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:12.205
the gripping fear
of being on the moon for the first time

01:04:12.205 --> 01:04:14.374
if we can't show a human face?

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:16.167
Acting is a sport, Kelly.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:18.544
- It is energy, body, bu--
- Where do I set up?

01:04:19.671 --> 01:04:20.713
Edvard?

01:04:21.339 --> 01:04:23.758
- How did you get in here?
- I just walked through the door.

01:04:23.758 --> 01:04:28.680
What part of "talking about this is gonna
get us killed" do you not understand?

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.307
- And he's the slowest DP in New York.
- I pick the cinematographer.

01:04:31.307 --> 01:04:33.685
- It's in my contract.
- What? You don't have a contract.

01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:35.436
He's the best, and all DPs are slow.

01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:39.315
What we need to have
a serious conversation about, Kelly,

01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:40.775
is production design.

01:04:41.693 --> 01:04:44.821
What materials are we using
to recreate the lunar surface?

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.406
It's just a big rock, right?

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:56.624
I can't work like this, Kelly.

01:04:58.084 --> 01:04:59.460
You know this about me.

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:01.629
I need details.

01:05:01.629 --> 01:05:04.173
We need details. Specifics.

01:05:04.716 --> 01:05:08.344
Is it dusty, rocky, windy?
What is the light source?

01:05:08.344 --> 01:05:12.348
- It's the sun. Big light.
- Do not smart-mouth me, Edvard.

01:05:13.308 --> 01:05:16.102
And what is the sun's position
in relation to the landing area?

01:05:16.102 --> 01:05:18.187
And are we building a replica?
Do we have a plan?

01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:21.733
Do we have suits,
and how do people move in those suits?

01:05:21.733 --> 01:05:24.277
And what, Kelly,
does space even look like?

01:05:24.277 --> 01:05:26.279
You know, I gotta-- I gotta lie down.

01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:28.823
Where is my trailer?

01:05:31.326 --> 01:05:34.704
We need to find a way to copy everything
in that simulation room.

01:05:34.704 --> 01:05:36.331
- Okay.
- ASAP.

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:38.416
Wait a second. Do I even have a trailer?

01:05:39.584 --> 01:05:41.544
Your silence tells me what I already know.

01:05:41.544 --> 01:05:43.588
You haven't thought about
how to recreate the moon,

01:05:43.588 --> 01:05:46.633
- why would you think about a trailer?
- I think we should've gotten Kubrick.

01:05:46.633 --> 01:05:48.509
We've got to get this new ship right.

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.261
I mean, Armstrong, he was pissed off

01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:51.804
- and we can't have that again.
- Sorry.

01:05:53.389 --> 01:05:54.432
Buddy, buddy.

01:05:54.432 --> 01:05:56.476
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is sensitive material.

01:05:56.476 --> 01:05:58.394
- Henry. Henry.
- You can't be here.

01:05:58.394 --> 01:06:01.189
These photos are for the archival book
that Penguin is doing.

01:06:01.189 --> 01:06:02.982
- What book?
- Yeah, didn't you get the memo?

01:06:02.982 --> 01:06:04.442
- No.
- What? You're writing the foreword.

01:06:04.442 --> 01:06:07.278
- I-- I'm writing the foreword?
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:07.278 --> 01:06:08.821
- Me?
- Yes, of course.

01:06:08.821 --> 01:06:11.199
- I've never written a foreword.
- The editor wants to hear from you.

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:12.492
- We all do.
- He wants me to write it?

01:06:12.492 --> 01:06:14.827
Don't be so humble, all right?
Let's get a photo of you with the--

01:06:14.827 --> 01:06:16.412
- with the LEM.
- I mean, I can do it, but--

01:06:16.412 --> 01:06:17.622
Say, "we're going to the moon."

01:06:17.622 --> 01:06:19.624
- We're going to the moon.
- There you go!

01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:23.461
Aldrin and Armstrong will practice
every single movement that they make

01:06:23.461 --> 01:06:25.338
right here for months.

01:06:25.338 --> 01:06:26.714
- That is incredible.
- Yeah.

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:28.967
So, this is, like,
the surface of the moon?

01:06:28.967 --> 01:06:30.093
- Well, yeah. It's--
- Yeah.

01:06:30.093 --> 01:06:31.427
It's our best approximation.

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:34.389
This just looks like a dirty beach.
I don't believe it. No.

01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:36.349
- It is-- It's based off sediment we got.
- Joseph.

01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:37.266
It's from NASA--

01:06:37.266 --> 01:06:40.144
Wait. I do not believe
this is what NASA uses

01:06:40.144 --> 01:06:42.313
to go to the moon.
You cannot tell me-- No.

01:06:42.313 --> 01:06:46.401
Want you to walk as if you're
carrying your mother across the desert.

01:06:46.401 --> 01:06:49.654
She's frail but also heavy.

01:06:50.279 --> 01:06:51.280
Whoa. Hey.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.824
- So sorry. Hey. Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. No.

01:06:52.824 --> 01:06:54.617
- This is classified. You're not allow--
- Stu, we're good.

01:06:54.617 --> 01:06:56.452
- Very classified.
- We're good here. This is for the book.

01:06:56.452 --> 01:06:57.578
No, you'll hear about it.

01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:58.496
I'm doing the foreword,

01:06:58.496 --> 01:06:59.831
- so you'll hear about it soon.
- Okay.

01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:02.667
My Armstrong is a whiny, little bitch.
We have to recast.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.294
No-- We're not recasting.

01:07:04.836 --> 01:07:06.546
All right. Well, mediocre it is.

01:07:06.546 --> 01:07:09.048
Edvard! Where is my sun?

01:07:09.841 --> 01:07:10.842
Nice!

01:07:10.842 --> 01:07:12.593
- Very nice.
- A countdown at least.

01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:14.345
Okay. Try it again.

01:07:14.345 --> 01:07:15.972
- Gonna try it again.
- Do a three, two, one!

01:07:15.972 --> 01:07:17.056
- Come on!
- Happy?

01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:19.350
Joseph, bring me my Tab.

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:21.602
You're gonna have to find me
'cause I can't see a thing.

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:23.730
Come on. How long does it take
to give someone a Tab?

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.315
My hand's right here.

01:07:25.315 --> 01:07:27.317
This will be great.
You guys should all come around

01:07:27.317 --> 01:07:29.485
- and we'll do a shot for the book.
- Great?

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:32.030
Hey, how about this?
Everybody, "We're going to the moon!"

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:35.033
We're going to the moon!

01:07:35.908 --> 01:07:38.036
My eyes might have been closed.
You wanna do one more?

01:07:41.748 --> 01:07:43.333
I haven't seen you around lately.

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:45.418
Well, I can say the same thing about you.

01:07:47.337 --> 01:07:49.047
How do you do it on the first try?

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:52.216
It's not rocket science. Okay. You good?

01:07:53.551 --> 01:07:54.761
- About the questions, I--
- Yes.

01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:59.057
I went over them. Nothing about Apollo 1.
They promised me. Okay?

01:08:00.516 --> 01:08:02.435
You're gonna be great. Okay?

01:08:02.435 --> 01:08:03.519
Go on.

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:04.604
- Okay.
- Go.

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.109
Mr. Davis.
You are what we call "a tough get."

01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:11.194
Ha! No. Thank you.

01:08:11.194 --> 01:08:14.489
Is there any legal importance
to what we'll be watching

01:08:14.489 --> 01:08:18.117
when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
walk on the lunar surface?

01:08:18.117 --> 01:08:22.163
Will the area they land on be considered
property of the United States?

01:08:22.163 --> 01:08:25.833
We're sending a plaque that says,
"We came in peace for all mankind."

01:08:25.833 --> 01:08:27.418
And that is precisely what we mean.

01:08:27.418 --> 01:08:29.462
What else will NASA leave behind?

01:08:29.963 --> 01:08:32.298
Footprints, an American flag
and 12 bags of feces

01:08:32.298 --> 01:08:35.259
that I was told many times
that I should not bring up, but...

01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:37.220
Should've put him
in front of a camera sooner.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.805
You wear an Apollo pin.

01:08:39.931 --> 01:08:40.932
I do.

01:08:41.516 --> 01:08:43.810
The wives of Apollo 1's men,

01:08:45.019 --> 01:08:47.105
after we lost them, they gave me this.

01:08:47.105 --> 01:08:50.108
You were launch director
on that tragic day.

01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:53.695
What went wrong with Apollo 1?

01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:59.325
In your own words, what happened?

01:09:01.494 --> 01:09:02.537
Take me back.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:09.836
Okay. Here's some facts for you.

01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:11.004
<i>The New York Times</i> reported

01:09:11.004 --> 01:09:13.715
there were 20,000 safety reports
filed about that ship.

01:09:13.715 --> 01:09:17.427
So many, that Gus Grissom
hung a lemon outside it.

01:09:19.971 --> 01:09:22.974
<i>All right, crew.
To be confirmed. Location.</i>

01:09:22.974 --> 01:09:23.975
<i>Flame!</i>

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:26.060
<i>We've got a fire in the cockpit.</i>

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:26.977
<i>Let's get out!</i>

01:09:26.977 --> 01:09:29.981
Mr. Davis? Did you read those reports?

01:09:29.981 --> 01:09:32.108
<i>Pad leader, get in there and help 'em.</i>

01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:34.569
<i>Pad leader, stay on C3.</i>

01:09:40.615 --> 01:09:43.077
Mr. Davis? Did you read those reports?

01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:49.459
- Did you read those reports?
- Of course I read the reports.

01:09:49.959 --> 01:09:51.461
I read every single one of them.

01:09:52.169 --> 01:09:55.256
Overpressured oxygen
and a bad wire on a "plugs-out" test.

01:09:56.173 --> 01:10:00.218
I was supposed to catch everything,
and I missed it. And I failed them.

01:10:00.218 --> 01:10:03.056
And I will live with that every single day
for the rest of my life.

01:10:03.056 --> 01:10:05.682
Is that the quote that you
were looking for, you piece of shit?

01:10:05.682 --> 01:10:08.227
Get me on the phone with your boss.
Now. Now!

01:10:10.104 --> 01:10:12.398
Wait. What are you doing?
We have another 20 minutes.

01:10:12.398 --> 01:10:13.483
Go to hell.

01:10:13.483 --> 01:10:16.444
Don't be angry with me. I'm not the reason
three astronauts are dead.

01:10:20.907 --> 01:10:22.992
- Say one more thing about the astronauts.
- Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:24.911
Get off me.
Let me hear you say one more thing--

01:10:24.911 --> 01:10:26.704
Let me hear you say
one more thing about them!

01:10:26.704 --> 01:10:28.873
You don't know those men!
You don't talk about those men!

01:10:28.873 --> 01:10:30.667
Get off me! Get off!

01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:31.751
Get off!

01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:33.419
Do you understand me?

01:10:40.301 --> 01:10:43.471
So, I spoke to the producers,
and they've agreed to seal the film

01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:47.183
if we give them the exclusive
with Armstrong after he lands.

01:10:52.355 --> 01:10:54.774
We lost Hedges though. He's voting no.

01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:59.946
- You said they wouldn't ask about it.
- Yeah. Well... they lied.

01:10:59.946 --> 01:11:01.572
You know, people do that sometimes, Cole.

01:11:01.572 --> 01:11:03.574
You could have done yourself
and this program a favor

01:11:03.574 --> 01:11:05.618
and maybe tried it yourself. Right?

01:11:05.618 --> 01:11:07.453
Blame NASA.

01:11:07.453 --> 01:11:08.621
Blame the system.

01:11:09.455 --> 01:11:12.125
I mean, there was half a billion dollars
worth of funding on the line.

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:14.460
Lying must be so easy for you
when you do it all the time.

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:15.670
It's just always an option.

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:18.214
- What you should try is the truth.
- What is this sanctimonious bullshit?

01:11:18.214 --> 01:11:20.883
I'm never going to lie
about those men or that day.

01:11:20.883 --> 01:11:22.010
Do you understand that?

01:11:22.969 --> 01:11:24.637
You think what you want about me,

01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:28.766
but I didn't cost the world a dream
because I lost my goddamn cool.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:02.508
This is Launch Complex 34,
where the Apollo 1 tragedy occurred.

01:12:02.508 --> 01:12:05.219
This is a tribute to our fallen heroes,

01:12:05.219 --> 01:12:08.806
the brave men
who paved the road to our success.

01:12:09.849 --> 01:12:12.602
Please, let's take a moment
of silence for them.

01:12:23.863 --> 01:12:25.198
Edvard, that looks incredible.

01:12:25.198 --> 01:12:27.033
I can't see the wires at all.
How did you do that?

01:12:27.033 --> 01:12:29.035
I just put a flag. It's very simple.

01:12:29.035 --> 01:12:29.952
Old school.

01:12:29.952 --> 01:12:32.455
No. Again. From the top.

01:12:32.455 --> 01:12:35.124
And maybe let's get
some more bounce this time.

01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:36.459
You are on the moon.

01:12:37.752 --> 01:12:38.878
Good.

01:12:45.009 --> 01:12:46.886
- Oh, my God.
- I can't. I can't with this day.

01:12:47.887 --> 01:12:50.807
- Oh, dear. Okay, hold on.
- Joseph, there's a fire.

01:12:50.807 --> 01:12:51.975
I got it.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.102
Don't forget to PASS.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.736
Okay. Can you bring them down?
Actually, leave them up.

01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:05.989
Let them think about what they did.

01:13:07.323 --> 01:13:09.951
I give up. I'm taking lunch.

01:13:13.329 --> 01:13:16.332
You see what you did?
You made her take lunch early.

01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:18.626
That's on you.

01:13:30.096 --> 01:13:32.473
I'll bet you $5 you're bad at apologies.

01:13:32.473 --> 01:13:33.766
I've been looking all over for you.

01:13:33.766 --> 01:13:35.351
- You owe me five bucks.
- I got an idea.

01:13:35.351 --> 01:13:36.436
What?

01:13:36.436 --> 01:13:38.229
Come on. I'll tell you
on the way to Louisiana.

01:13:38.896 --> 01:13:41.149
No. You wanna take a shot at Vanning?

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:44.944
I got us a dinner invite, for tonight.
Come on.

01:13:44.944 --> 01:13:46.988
Tonight? We're never gonna make it.
It's 500 miles away.

01:13:46.988 --> 01:13:49.073
We're gonna make it. Come on.
You gotta trust me.

01:13:49.949 --> 01:13:50.992
Wait. No.

01:13:50.992 --> 01:13:52.327
- No, no, no.
- What do you mean, "no"?

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:54.704
- We don't-- There's other-- We could--
- Do you want Vanning or not?

01:13:55.204 --> 01:13:56.664
- No. I don't--
- Come on. Let's go.

01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:58.833
I think we could just
take a commercial flight. If we left--

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.752
Nope. No commercial flights
are flying right now.

01:14:00.752 --> 01:14:02.420
Come on. Just hop on in.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.131
This is it. This is all you gotta do.
You can hop up, you can get in.

01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:06.924
- Put your foot there.
- Okay, well, take these.

01:14:06.924 --> 01:14:08.384
- Look, we gotta go.
- All right.

01:14:08.384 --> 01:14:09.886
Hold on. Hold on.

01:14:13.014 --> 01:14:14.265
- Perfect.
- Hold on.

01:14:14.849 --> 01:14:15.683
We're good.

01:14:25.902 --> 01:14:27.278
You enjoying the view?

01:14:27.278 --> 01:14:28.696
Wow! It's stunning!

01:14:29.614 --> 01:14:31.240
I bet your eyes are closed.

01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:33.284
No.

01:14:45.171 --> 01:14:46.965
So, I'm betting you have
some other Southern accents

01:14:46.965 --> 01:14:48.925
in that bag of tricks of yours.
Can you do Louisiana?

01:14:48.925 --> 01:14:50.468
Yeah. New Orleans or Baton Rouge?

01:14:50.468 --> 01:14:52.053
- Wherever his wife's from.
- Okay.

01:14:54.681 --> 01:14:56.015
Cole Davis.

01:14:56.015 --> 01:14:57.892
And you must be Miss Kelly Jones.

01:14:57.892 --> 01:14:59.310
Please come in, y'all.

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:00.895
Thank you so much
for having us for dinner.

01:15:01.688 --> 01:15:04.482
Now, I was told
you were a New York City type.

01:15:04.482 --> 01:15:06.943
Oh, God, no. I just work there.
I'm from Louisiana.

01:15:06.943 --> 01:15:08.319
Born and raised and, one day, buried.

01:15:08.319 --> 01:15:11.072
- I'm from Virginia.
- No? We're family.

01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:14.659
You know, Tex Ritter always said
Virginia was the mother of Texas.

01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:17.912
Well, we never knew who the father was.
We always suspected it was Louisiana.

01:15:18.788 --> 01:15:19.914
My mother loves that one.

01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:22.083
- She was the one that came up with it.
- Just so colorful.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:25.211
- You're fun.
- This is a beautiful home.

01:15:28.339 --> 01:15:31.134
So, how is the campaign going, Senator?

01:15:31.718 --> 01:15:35.346
Truth be told,
politics is more of a hobby to me.

01:15:37.098 --> 01:15:40.310
Serving Christ, that's my full-time job.

01:15:41.936 --> 01:15:44.981
You know, there's a war on religion
in this country.

01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:47.650
And some say science is to blame.

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.570
Well, science is
what brought us to this table.

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:53.197
You learned a little lesson
on the provocation of pride

01:15:53.197 --> 01:15:55.867
on Apollo 1, now, didn't you, Cole?

01:15:57.702 --> 01:16:01.122
Science has actually
brought me closer to God, sir.

01:16:01.664 --> 01:16:05.543
Took the Lord six days to put forth
everything that we know as creation.

01:16:05.543 --> 01:16:07.920
And on that sixth day
he gave us dominion over it.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.923
And, personally,
I take that as a responsibility.

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:15.428
You sound like a man
who knows his way to church.

01:16:15.428 --> 01:16:18.848
Well, I can't think
of a greater act of faith

01:16:18.848 --> 01:16:20.350
than pursuing the stars.

01:16:21.517 --> 01:16:25.980
"The heavens declare the glory of God.
And the firmament shows us his handiwork."

01:16:26.522 --> 01:16:29.150
That's one of Jolene's favorite Psalms.

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.861
You see, our men,
when they come back from space,

01:16:32.695 --> 01:16:34.614
they believe more in God, not less.

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.492
But when we land on the moon,

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:43.164
and thanks to Miss Jones here,
the world watches us do it.

01:16:43.164 --> 01:16:47.627
And it's my hope that people everywhere
feel the presence of that divine.

01:16:50.838 --> 01:16:52.507
Well...

01:16:53.633 --> 01:16:58.972
...you've certainly
given me a lot to think about, son.

01:17:07.647 --> 01:17:09.857
You really sold the hell out of that.

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:11.359
I wasn't selling.

01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:16.990
For the record, you can win people over
just by being who you are.

01:17:21.869 --> 01:17:24.872
You know, we're not in a rush,
so we don't really have to fly home.

01:17:24.872 --> 01:17:26.708
That wasn't flying.

01:17:38.094 --> 01:17:39.804
Come on. Open your eyes.

01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:51.774
You trust me?

01:17:54.902 --> 01:17:55.903
Hold tight.

01:18:04.704 --> 01:18:07.373
Now, this is the fun part. Just slide off.

01:18:12.378 --> 01:18:13.546
Perfect.

01:18:59.759 --> 01:19:01.844
<i>I've had my disagreements</i>

01:19:01.844 --> 01:19:05.431
<i>with the NASA program in the past.</i>

01:19:05.431 --> 01:19:09.686
<i>But after a great deal of thought,
and prayer,</i>

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.814
<i>I've decided to vote yes.</i>

01:19:16.359 --> 01:19:17.652
Come on.

01:19:20.196 --> 01:19:21.948
I have something that you need to see.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:23.574
- What--
- Follow me.

01:19:24.575 --> 01:19:25.910
I didn't know which way it was gonna go,

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:28.121
'cause you can't tell with these guys.

01:19:28.121 --> 01:19:30.498
I never liked that guy before,

01:19:31.165 --> 01:19:32.500
but I like him now.

01:19:33.793 --> 01:19:34.961
All right!

01:19:34.961 --> 01:19:37.130
- It's so dark in here. You--
- Almost there.

01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:39.841
- I'm a little scared.
- Yeah, it's right around here.

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:44.512
We wanted to show you our appreciation.

01:19:45.513 --> 01:19:47.890
- Oh, my gosh. This is too much.
- Thank you.

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.934
- I can't believe it.
- It was all Walter.

01:19:49.934 --> 01:19:51.978
Walter? I know that
you did all of this, didn't you?

01:19:51.978 --> 01:19:53.896
- A little. That's all.
- Yeah, I know you did.

01:19:53.896 --> 01:19:55.523
- They all helped.
- Not too bad, huh?

01:20:11.497 --> 01:20:13.207
Before I forget. Here.

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:16.502
It's a list of things for you to say
when you take your first step.

01:20:16.502 --> 01:20:19.464
I-- I know everybody's asking you.
I thought I'd give you some options.

01:20:20.256 --> 01:20:21.591
Well, I was just gonna say,

01:20:21.591 --> 01:20:23.718
"Look at all those cool rocks,"
or something.

01:20:24.969 --> 01:20:26.346
- I got this one, Kelly.
- Okay.

01:20:27.347 --> 01:20:28.556
And thank you, though.

01:20:28.556 --> 01:20:32.060
And I mean it. For-- For everything.

01:20:34.145 --> 01:20:38.608
You know, I don't think anyone cares
about this program more than Cole Davis.

01:20:40.777 --> 01:20:43.488
It's nice to see he's found
something else to care about.

01:21:02.632 --> 01:21:06.427
I know I'm no, astronaut,
but can I steal you for a dance?

01:21:07.553 --> 01:21:09.305
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah? Come on.

01:21:18.648 --> 01:21:22.151
So, you just counting down the days
until you can get back to Manhattan?

01:21:22.694 --> 01:21:23.987
Not really.

01:21:23.987 --> 01:21:25.154
Good.

01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:48.303
Up, up, up. Perfect.
Right, now, move the light in.

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:50.346
All right, keep going. Don't be shy.

01:21:50.346 --> 01:21:53.433
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.

01:21:54.892 --> 01:21:56.227
Milk it. Good.

01:21:58.688 --> 01:22:00.940
Ladies, what do we think?

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.401
- Lance, it's incredible.
- It's great.

01:22:03.401 --> 01:22:07.280
I think it needs a little more dust
and better actors,

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.157
but I lost that battle.

01:22:09.949 --> 01:22:10.992
I will let it go.

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:14.454
And, stop. Okay.

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.164
We've got our sun.

01:22:16.914 --> 01:22:19.042
I always went along
with every web you spun

01:22:19.042 --> 01:22:23.087
because it was fun or, like,
we were pulling one over on the bad guys,

01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:25.131
but this feels--

01:22:25.131 --> 01:22:26.299
I know.

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.093
We're almost done.

01:22:34.474 --> 01:22:35.767
This is from me.

01:22:35.767 --> 01:22:37.518
It is for launch day.

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:40.730
Promise you will wait until then.

01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:42.148
- I promise.
- Okay.

01:22:44.776 --> 01:22:46.527
Remember, you're not monsters.

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.822
Are they gonna be that high?

01:22:50.448 --> 01:22:52.700
I just need to give them any length

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.703
that looks like they're on the moon.
But thank you for the note.

01:22:55.703 --> 01:22:57.205
Buzz, take it down some.

01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:59.999
And, Armstrong, stop looking at me
for approval.

01:22:59.999 --> 01:23:03.670
- Just be on the moon. I'm not here.
- He's having fun. He's having fun.

01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:06.673
He keeps locking eyes with me.
Stop flirting and be on the moon.

01:23:15.807 --> 01:23:18.851
<i>Yesterday's science fiction
is today's fact.</i>

01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:20.269
<i>The methods are different,</i>

01:23:20.269 --> 01:23:22.814
<i>but the important thing
is that tomorrow morning,</i>

01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:25.233
<i>man will lift off toward the moon.</i>

01:23:37.829 --> 01:23:40.248
<i>Good evening. I'm Walter Cronkite.</i>

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:44.252
<i>And on this eve of man's first flight
toward a landing on the moon,</i>

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:46.796
<i>all preparations go smoothly.</i>

01:23:46.796 --> 01:23:48.214
<i>The weather prediction,</i>

01:23:48.214 --> 01:23:51.050
<i>along with the health
of astronauts, Neil Arm--</i>

01:24:20.204 --> 01:24:21.372
Yes?

01:24:30.757 --> 01:24:34.385
Well, you know how to hurt a fella.

01:24:35.219 --> 01:24:36.554
No courtesy call?

01:24:36.554 --> 01:24:38.264
Well, I don't have your number.

01:24:38.264 --> 01:24:39.390
You ran.

01:24:40.933 --> 01:24:42.560
That's what you do best.

01:24:43.353 --> 01:24:46.105
Your alternate version is wrong.
I never should've been a part of it.

01:24:46.105 --> 01:24:47.231
I quit.

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:48.983
Sit.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.577
So, who are we gonna be today?

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:01.913
Let's see.

01:25:04.582 --> 01:25:06.376
Helen Parker.

01:25:06.918 --> 01:25:09.212
I bet you do a killer British accent.

01:25:10.254 --> 01:25:13.466
You wanna take off and be Helen? Go ahead.

01:25:15.635 --> 01:25:18.513
Helen doesn't have
to look over her shoulder.

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:20.473
No one is coming for you.

01:25:22.308 --> 01:25:23.309
Unless?

01:25:23.309 --> 01:25:28.147
Unless you ever tell anyone
that Project Artemis was real,

01:25:28.147 --> 01:25:31.067
and the moon landing was fake.

01:25:31.985 --> 01:25:34.904
On that score, change of plans.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.617
We're going to air the alternate version.

01:25:39.617 --> 01:25:40.743
No matter what.

01:25:40.743 --> 01:25:42.912
You were never gonna broadcast
the real thing.

01:25:42.912 --> 01:25:44.914
This isn't just a race for the moon.

01:25:44.914 --> 01:25:50.128
It is a race for which ideology
gets to run things.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.383
I got one of my men to rig the LEM camera
so that it just beams back audio.

01:25:55.383 --> 01:26:00.680
We're gonna sync with their sound
and use your fake stage broadcast,

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.598
start to finish.

01:26:03.099 --> 01:26:07.729
Let me be the first to thank you
on behalf of America.

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:15.153
Come on, don't feel bad.
Everybody gets what they want.

01:26:16.237 --> 01:26:19.782
You get a new life
with no past to run from.

01:26:19.782 --> 01:26:25.038
And the world doesn't have to sleep
under a communist moon.

01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:30.918
Okay. Panama beckons.

01:26:31.711 --> 01:26:35.214
You better hurry. You're going to
miss your flight, Helen.

01:26:40.136 --> 01:26:42.263
<i>This is
a typical meal served to astronauts</i>

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:44.140

<i>Oatmeal, toast,</i>

What are you doing here?

01:28:53.311 --> 01:28:54.687
I need to show you something.

01:28:57.315 --> 01:28:59.776
It was supposed to be a contingency plan.

01:28:59.776 --> 01:29:02.278
That's how he sold it.
It was an insurance policy.

01:29:02.278 --> 01:29:03.488
In case we failed.

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.158
It's good to know...

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.410
...that you never believed in us.

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:10.995
I know you're upset.

01:29:10.995 --> 01:29:12.747
- I understand--
- What do you understand?

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.749
Please tell me what you understand.

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.626
'Cause you don't
understand shit about truth.

01:29:16.626 --> 01:29:18.670
If you fake this mission--
If you fake this mission,

01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:22.173
every single thing that we have sacrificed
will have been for nothing.

01:29:23.174 --> 01:29:25.510
I know I messed up. I know that.

01:29:26.552 --> 01:29:28.846
But you know you couldn't have made it
to this day without me.

01:29:28.846 --> 01:29:31.349
I could've walked away last night,
but I didn't.

01:29:31.349 --> 01:29:35.061
I came back to fix this.

01:29:37.188 --> 01:29:38.314
Fix what?

01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:41.943
Moe cut the LEM camera,
and if we don't fix this together

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.028
then this is gonna be the version
that the world sees.

01:29:48.825 --> 01:29:50.410
It's not a contingency.

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:56.082
God, you're so good
at leaving me no options.

01:30:01.546 --> 01:30:03.172
Fine, let's fix it.

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:07.510
But when this is over,
I never wanna see your face again.

01:30:21.774 --> 01:30:24.319
This is what happens
when you work for Richard Nixon.

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:28.781
I got your book, Ruby.

01:30:29.532 --> 01:30:30.575
You opened it early.

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:32.744
It came at just the right time.

01:30:41.252 --> 01:30:43.504
<i>...proper atmosphere for launch</i>

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:47.091
<i>which is a combination

<i>Sixty percent oxygen

It's busted.

01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.348
The camera's video preamplifier.

01:31:35.348 --> 01:31:36.891
- It's destroyed.
- Okay, can you fix that?

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.726
I could maybe repurpose
a part from a TV, but--

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.645
Well, that's fine.
There's plenty of TVs around here.

01:31:40.645 --> 01:31:42.230
NASA's TVs-- They are all too old.

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.941
I mean a brand-new solid-state color TV.

01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:46.484
Well, how fast can you get one?

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:48.695
How fast can you get me
to an electronics store?

01:31:48.695 --> 01:31:50.697
- Me?
- In the worst traffic in Florida history.

01:31:50.697 --> 01:31:51.948
I can't. I have to prep the guys.

01:31:51.948 --> 01:31:53.408
Give me the keys.

01:31:54.784 --> 01:31:55.952
Fine, I'll stall.

01:31:55.952 --> 01:31:57.996
Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:32:03.626 --> 01:32:05.169
<i>Hotels are at capacity.</i>

01:32:05.169 --> 01:32:07.213
<i>Kennedy Space Center is so crowded,</i>

01:32:07.213 --> 01:32:09.924
we're hearing it's nearly impossible
to get in or out.

01:32:14.804 --> 01:32:15.805
Kelly, slow down.

01:32:15.805 --> 01:32:17.098
Are you guys good back there?

01:32:17.098 --> 01:32:18.182
- Yes.
- No.

01:32:20.685 --> 01:32:22.228
Please, please stop. Please stop.

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.484
There it is. There's the store.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.500
- No!
- They're closed.

01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:47.670
- They're closed.
- What?

01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:49.047
No, no. No, they are not.

01:32:49.047 --> 01:32:51.049
- Kelly.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

01:32:52.216 --> 01:32:53.551
What are you waiting for? Go!

01:32:53.551 --> 01:32:55.136
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

01:32:56.095 --> 01:32:57.096
Okay.

01:32:59.182 --> 01:33:00.266
Okay--

01:33:00.266 --> 01:33:01.851
- Yes, this one. This is great.
- Yeah, okay.

01:33:01.851 --> 01:33:04.562
- I would help. I'm just not tall enough.
- Come on, Don. All right.

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:08.066
- All right. Slowly, all right.
- Guys, come on.

01:33:10.401 --> 01:33:12.070
Oh, my God. I can't go to jail.

01:33:12.945 --> 01:33:14.322
Let me handle this.

01:33:27.752 --> 01:33:28.753
She's good.

01:33:29.587 --> 01:33:30.672
Yeah.

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:16.175
Have a good ride, boys.

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:23.558
<i>In a matter of five minutes or so</i>

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:26.436
<i>we'll be ready for the spacecraft
commander, Neil Armstrong,</i>

01:34:26.436 --> 01:34:29.731
<i>to come across the sill
at the 320-foot level.</i>

01:34:45.496 --> 01:34:47.373
- <i>The trip in the transfer van...</i>
- Come on!

01:34:47.373 --> 01:34:50.335
<i>...could take some 15 minutes or so
to reach the pad.</i>

01:34:50.335 --> 01:34:54.464
<i>At which time the astronauts
will board, the first of two elevators</i>

01:34:54.464 --> 01:34:58.801
<i>for the trip to the 320-foot level
at the launchpad,</i>

01:34:59.385 --> 01:35:02.388
<i>where they will then proceed
to ingress the spacecraft.</i>

01:35:06.517 --> 01:35:07.977
Whoa. We are locked and loaded, kid.

01:35:07.977 --> 01:35:09.812
No, no.
Flight Deck wants this on the ship.

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.443
- This is Flight Deck. Let him through.
- <i>Got it.</i>

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.444
Go.

01:35:19.489 --> 01:35:21.991
Okay, we need to initiate prelaunch,
or we lose the window.

01:35:21.991 --> 01:35:23.034
Just give him one minute.

01:35:23.034 --> 01:35:24.619
<i>...320-foot level,</i>

01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:27.455
<i>all three astronauts
now aboard the spacecraft.</i>

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:30.875
<i>A few minutes ago, Astronaut Buzz Aldrin,
came in and took the center seat...</i>

01:35:30.875 --> 01:35:35.463
I'm hearing the cabin's now being sealed.
Countdown has begun.

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:38.549
<i>These are
the positions they will fly at liftoff.</i>

01:35:39.217 --> 01:35:41.219
<i>CDR, STC, how do you read?</i>

01:35:41.219 --> 01:35:43.096
<i>STC, loud and clear.</i>

01:35:43.096 --> 01:35:45.348
- <i>Good morning, Neil.</i>
- Gantry is cleared.

01:35:45.348 --> 01:35:46.516
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

01:35:46.516 --> 01:35:49.894
Apollo 11 is a go for launch
in T-minus ten minutes.

01:35:50.603 --> 01:35:51.729
Okay.

01:35:55.817 --> 01:35:56.818
He's here.

01:35:57.902 --> 01:35:58.987
It's connected.

01:35:58.987 --> 01:36:01.280
At least I think I connected it.

01:36:01.823 --> 01:36:02.991
Stu, what the hell does that mean?

01:36:04.867 --> 01:36:07.954
I only had a few seconds.
I didn't have time to stress test it. I--

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:13.334
Okay. Sit down.

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:18.798
All right, listen up!

01:36:24.971 --> 01:36:26.431
Whatever happens here today,

01:36:26.431 --> 01:36:29.434
I will stand by every decision
that you make.

01:36:30.643 --> 01:36:34.022
Over 400,000 people have worked
on this program for nearly ten years.

01:36:34.022 --> 01:36:36.274
All to keep one man's promise
to the world.

01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:38.860
So, let's keep it.

01:36:42.071 --> 01:36:44.407
All right. Give me, "Go/No go" for launch.

01:36:44.407 --> 01:36:47.160
<i>Roger. All stations, stand by
for final "Go/No go."</i>

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.244
- <i>MACE.</i>
- Go.

01:36:48.244 --> 01:36:49.620
- <i>ECS.</i>
- Go.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.164
- <i>EPS.</i>
- Go.

01:36:51.164 --> 01:36:52.415
- <i>Sequencer.</i>
- Go.

01:36:52.415 --> 01:36:53.666
- <i>GNS.</i>
- Go.

01:36:53.666 --> 01:36:56.294
- <i>SCS.</i>
- This is the best part.

01:36:56.294 --> 01:36:59.047
They go down the line and every single--

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.175
every single technician has to say,
"Go," or, "No go," for launch.

01:37:02.175 --> 01:37:03.593
Any one of them can stop it.

01:37:04.844 --> 01:37:07.055
<i>CFAT. CSE, can you give me a "go" now?</i>

01:37:07.055 --> 01:37:08.139
<i>CSE is go.</i>

01:37:08.139 --> 01:37:10.350
<i>Okay. Eagle is go.</i>

01:37:25.782 --> 01:37:27.784
<i>CBTS, this is CSA 9.</i>

01:37:27.784 --> 01:37:29.744
<i>Twenty seconds and counting.</i>

01:37:31.204 --> 01:37:34.082
<i>T-minus 15 seconds. Guidance is internal.</i>

01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:39.420
<i>...Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...</i>

01:37:41.464 --> 01:37:43.174
Ignition sequence starts.

01:37:55.353 --> 01:38:00.108
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:38:00.108 --> 01:38:01.609
All engines running.

01:38:30.263 --> 01:38:32.265
Liftoff. We have liftoff.

01:38:40.315 --> 01:38:41.399
Tower clear.

01:38:43.359 --> 01:38:45.278
Houston, she's all yours.

01:39:57.642 --> 01:39:59.894
Moe Berkus is here. For both of you.

01:40:00.603 --> 01:40:02.480
<i>Apollo 11 is on the way.</i>

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.565
<i>250,000 miles away,</i>

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:08.861
<i>where the moon is waiting
for man's first arrival.</i>

01:40:08.861 --> 01:40:11.072
<i>Flight to take three days.</i>

01:40:11.072 --> 01:40:14.534
<i>And the spacecraft to reach there...</i>

01:40:14.534 --> 01:40:16.077
Kelly told me everything.

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:18.538
<i>The landing to take place on Sunday.</i>

01:40:18.538 --> 01:40:19.789
<i>And Neil Armstrong to set...</i>

01:40:19.789 --> 01:40:21.374
<i>Bravissimo.</i>

01:40:21.374 --> 01:40:23.126
- Shove it.
- That was history.

01:40:23.126 --> 01:40:25.378
Hi, Helen. Sorry, Kelly.

01:40:25.378 --> 01:40:28.798
I heard you came back, so I came back too.

01:40:30.675 --> 01:40:34.721
I-- I took a little peeky-poo
at the moon set,

01:40:34.721 --> 01:40:37.515
and it is perfection.

01:40:38.016 --> 01:40:39.017
Great job.

01:40:39.017 --> 01:40:42.228
If you think that I'm gonna let you
broadcast some fake version of this,

01:40:42.228 --> 01:40:43.730
I'll go to the press right now.

01:40:44.647 --> 01:40:45.732
Cole.

01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:48.192
Cole. Cole.

01:40:52.196 --> 01:40:56.701
You-- You go to the press.
Bring 'em by the moon set,

01:40:57.577 --> 01:41:02.540
but just know that no one will ever trust
the legitimacy of NASA again.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:05.543
This is a matter of national security.

01:41:05.543 --> 01:41:08.796
This broadcast must take place
in a controlled setting.

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.382
You of all people must understand that.

01:41:12.216 --> 01:41:15.970
The mission isn't about landing
on the moon anymore.

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:21.559
It is about the world watching
America beat Russia on TV.

01:41:27.857 --> 01:41:29.275
I got a flight to catch.

01:41:31.653 --> 01:41:36.157
I'll be back in time
for the lunar broadcast.

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:37.659
I thought I'd watch it here.

01:41:38.493 --> 01:41:40.995
With you, Kelly. On the moon.

01:41:49.045 --> 01:41:51.798
Hey. We're making history.

01:42:24.330 --> 01:42:26.040
Everything you said about me is true.

01:42:26.708 --> 01:42:28.584
I'm a con artist, and I always have been.

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.464
My real name is not even Kelly.

01:42:35.842 --> 01:42:38.386
All those stories that I told you

01:42:38.386 --> 01:42:40.680
about my mom and I
selling products door-to-door,

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.806
those were true.

01:42:42.974 --> 01:42:44.142
They were all scams.

01:42:45.393 --> 01:42:47.729
And we started out small,
and then they got bigger.

01:42:48.438 --> 01:42:51.357
Like real estate and insurance.

01:42:51.357 --> 01:42:52.442
And...

01:42:54.444 --> 01:42:58.865
when I was 16,
a guy in North Dakota pulled a gun

01:42:58.865 --> 01:43:01.868
and my mom pulled hers out first
and she killed him.

01:43:01.868 --> 01:43:04.912
And she told me to run and I did.

01:43:05.538 --> 01:43:07.790
And she went to prison
and I never saw her again.

01:43:11.961 --> 01:43:15.381
And I forged documents
and used fake names to get jobs.

01:43:15.381 --> 01:43:19.385
And when I went to New York,
I found advertising.

01:43:19.385 --> 01:43:23.973
And that was like the scams
that my mom taught me, but it was legal.

01:43:27.393 --> 01:43:29.187
And I lied to so many people.

01:43:30.355 --> 01:43:32.482
The worst lies were
the ones I told myself.

01:43:33.566 --> 01:43:36.194
That everybody does it.
You know. It's just a big game.

01:43:38.529 --> 01:43:40.156
But then I came down here...

01:43:43.451 --> 01:43:44.577
I met you.

01:43:50.249 --> 01:43:52.835
I learned what it was like
to be a part of something real.

01:43:56.673 --> 01:43:58.967
Moe offered me a way to erase my past.

01:43:58.967 --> 01:44:00.802
I thought that's what I wanted, but...

01:44:04.389 --> 01:44:05.890
I don't wanna run anymore.

01:44:14.023 --> 01:44:16.651
Moe is a worthy opponent,
but he has met his match.

01:44:20.822 --> 01:44:24.784
I promise this is the last time I will
trick anyone into getting what I want.

01:44:26.285 --> 01:44:27.412
I promise.

01:44:29.747 --> 01:44:31.624
Do you think you can do it without lying?

01:44:33.626 --> 01:44:35.628
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:44:41.259 --> 01:44:42.385
So, what's the plan?

01:44:45.305 --> 01:44:46.597
<i>Why are we meeting out here?</i>

01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:49.809
Because Moe bugs everything.
The guy's like Houdini. He's everywhere.

01:44:49.809 --> 01:44:52.729
Okay, so, Moe doesn't know
that we fixed the LEM camera.

01:44:52.729 --> 01:44:54.188
We build a plan around that.

01:44:54.188 --> 01:44:57.900
All we have to do is convince him that
we are broadcasting the fake moon landing,

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.028
when in reality
we're broadcasting the real one.

01:45:00.695 --> 01:45:02.739
Is there a way that we could rig
the equipment

01:45:02.739 --> 01:45:05.241
so that it actually sends out
the real LEM video feed?

01:45:06.242 --> 01:45:07.243
Come on, boys.

01:45:07.243 --> 01:45:09.704
You figured out how to land on the moon.
Give me a hypothetical.

01:45:09.704 --> 01:45:13.583
Okay, hypothetically, we could rewire it.

01:45:13.583 --> 01:45:16.252
So that it only picks up
the broadcast signal from Mission Control.

01:45:16.252 --> 01:45:18.254
- Sure, then sync it with our feed.
- Right.

01:45:24.177 --> 01:45:25.219
Hey, fellas.

01:45:26.054 --> 01:45:28.640
Moe Berkus sent these guys
to test the broadcast feed.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.309
- Moe-- Moe Berk-- Yes.
- Moe Berk-- Moe Berkus.

01:45:32.393 --> 01:45:34.437
Telling me none of you got the phone call?

01:45:35.104 --> 01:45:37.065
Great. All right, where's the camera?

01:45:41.319 --> 01:45:42.403
Are you okay?

01:45:43.446 --> 01:45:44.906
Can you guys hurry up, please?

01:45:46.032 --> 01:45:47.408
Don, maybe just take the cigarette out.

01:45:47.992 --> 01:45:50.912
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've just never smoked a cigarette before.

01:45:52.121 --> 01:45:53.122
I don't like it.

01:45:55.458 --> 01:45:57.293
<i>...11, this is Houston.</i>

01:45:57.293 --> 01:45:58.503
<i>You are go for LOI. Over.</i>

01:45:58.503 --> 01:46:00.254
<i>Confirmed. On track for the moon.</i>

01:46:00.254 --> 01:46:02.131
<i>Apollo 11, this is Houston.</i>

01:46:02.131 --> 01:46:04.592
<i>All your systems are looking good.
Going around the corner.</i>

01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:06.135
<i>We'll see you on the other side. Over.</i>

01:46:06.135 --> 01:46:08.054
<i>And we've had loss of signal</i>

01:46:08.054 --> 01:46:10.556
<i>as Apollo 11 goes behind the moon.</i>

01:46:11.182 --> 01:46:14.519
<i>It's now 3:30 Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

01:46:14.519 --> 01:46:18.690
<i>At 3:46 we should be getting
the first signal from the Lunar Module.</i>

01:46:18.690 --> 01:46:21.317
<i>The estimated audience:
hundreds of millions.</i>

01:46:21.317 --> 01:46:23.987
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons
or so are watching</i>

01:46:23.987 --> 01:46:27.824
<i>this broadcast today
of the greatest event...</i>

01:46:27.824 --> 01:46:28.908
Boys.

01:46:30.368 --> 01:46:31.744
All right. Let's go.

01:46:39.794 --> 01:46:42.588
A little bit more. Well done, guys.

01:46:46.759 --> 01:46:50.305
Boys, when you hear my voice,
you hear God.

01:46:50.805 --> 01:46:52.223
Now, this is a fake moon,

01:46:52.223 --> 01:46:54.100
- but to the world, it's real.
- It's showtime, folks.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.643
It needs to-- Remember where I left off.

01:46:55.643 --> 01:46:59.147
Your government thanks you
for the work you're about to do.

01:47:00.064 --> 01:47:01.691
Now, don't fuck it up.

01:47:02.775 --> 01:47:04.986
What is this nasty shit doing here?

01:47:06.404 --> 01:47:08.406
- God.
- Excuse me.

01:47:08.406 --> 01:47:10.908
This is a Tab set, and that is my chair.

01:47:10.908 --> 01:47:13.286
- Kelly, let's deal with this.
- Lance, thank you so much.

01:47:13.286 --> 01:47:15.330
So, these screens-- This is our feed.

01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.414
Yeah.

01:47:16.414 --> 01:47:17.957
Okay. And then--

01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:20.460
And the TV's a live broadcast. Okay.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:23.421
Right.

01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:25.340
Joseph, I'm sitting.

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:27.050
Oh, my God. Are you real?

01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:29.135
I am the director, Lance Vespertine.

01:47:31.929 --> 01:47:33.431
Stay out of my way, will you?

01:47:33.431 --> 01:47:36.142
All right, I'd say it was nice
to meet you, but so far, it is not.

01:47:36.142 --> 01:47:37.894
The pigeon's in the coop.

01:47:37.894 --> 01:47:39.103
Copy that.

01:47:42.398 --> 01:47:44.359
<i>Okay, you should have him now, Houston.</i>

01:47:44.859 --> 01:47:47.362
<i>Eagle, we've got you now.
It's looking good. Over.</i>

01:47:50.323 --> 01:47:53.368
<i>We've got the Earth
right out of our front window.</i>

01:47:53.368 --> 01:47:55.787
<i>Flight, we are go for landing.</i>

01:47:55.787 --> 01:47:58.498
<i>Roger. Understand.
Go for landing. 3,000 feet.</i>

01:47:59.624 --> 01:48:01.542
<i>Eagle, looking great. You're go.</i>

01:48:14.222 --> 01:48:17.976
<i>Position checks
downrange show us to be a little long.</i>

01:48:17.976 --> 01:48:20.311
<i>1,400 feet. Still looking very good.</i>

01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:21.396
<i>P30.</i>

01:48:21.396 --> 01:48:23.231
<i>Six plus two-five.</i>

01:48:23.231 --> 01:48:24.816
<i>Looks like about 820.</i>

01:48:24.816 --> 01:48:26.359
<i>Throttle down.</i>

01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:30.613
<i>Flight, this is Eagle.</i>

01:48:31.114 --> 01:48:34.033
<i>Sea of Tranquility is rockier
than expected.</i>

01:48:34.742 --> 01:48:36.828
<i>We're gonna have to extend
another thousand feet.</i>

01:48:36.828 --> 01:48:38.204
Hey, boys.

01:48:40.498 --> 01:48:41.624
Where does that put us?

01:48:41.624 --> 01:48:43.793
- It'll give 'em 15 seconds of fuel left.
- They're gonna wanna abort.

01:48:43.793 --> 01:48:46.129
Neil can do this, they just gotta let him.

01:48:46.754 --> 01:48:48.423
<i>Stand by, Eagle.</i>

01:48:48.423 --> 01:48:51.009
<i>We are calculating
what that will do to our fuel reserves.</i>

01:48:51.009 --> 01:48:55.179
<i>EECOM puts that within 15 seconds.
Prepare for abort.</i>

01:48:56.556 --> 01:48:57.890
Flight...

01:48:57.890 --> 01:49:01.269
...we have run successful
tests within that range. Let 'em land.

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:05.523
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds.</i>

01:49:05.523 --> 01:49:07.233
- That's a lie.
- You lied.

01:49:07.775 --> 01:49:09.444
I've learned some new tricks. Sit down.

01:49:09.444 --> 01:49:12.113
<i>Okay, the only
callouts from now on will be fuel.</i>

01:49:13.656 --> 01:49:14.699
Come on.

01:49:15.575 --> 01:49:17.452
<i>Eagle, looking great. You're go.</i>

01:49:17.994 --> 01:49:20.163
<i>1,400 feet. Still looking very good.</i>

01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:24.459
<i>350 feet, down at four.</i>

01:49:25.209 --> 01:49:27.086
<i>Thirty. Thirty seconds</i>.

01:49:27.086 --> 01:49:28.713
<i>Down two and a half. Forward.</i>

01:49:29.255 --> 01:49:31.090
- <i>Forward. Good.</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

01:49:33.092 --> 01:49:34.844
<i>Eleven forward. Coming down nicely.</i>

01:49:34.844 --> 01:49:36.596
<i>200 feet, four and a half down.</i>

01:49:36.596 --> 01:49:39.307
<i>Five and a half down.
Five and a half down, nine forward.</i>

01:49:39.307 --> 01:49:40.391
<i>That's good.</i>

01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:55.114
<i>Contact light.</i>

01:49:59.202 --> 01:50:00.495
<i>Engine stop.</i>

01:50:12.882 --> 01:50:14.008
<i>Flight.</i>

01:50:15.718 --> 01:50:17.345
<i>Tranquility Base here.</i>

01:50:17.887 --> 01:50:19.389
<i>The Eagle has landed.</i>

01:50:26.104 --> 01:50:28.856
<i>Roger, Tranquility, we copy on the ground.</i>

01:50:28.856 --> 01:50:31.025
<i>You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.</i>

01:50:31.025 --> 01:50:32.568
<i>We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.</i>

01:50:39.367 --> 01:50:40.451
<i>Boy.</i>

01:50:40.451 --> 01:50:42.203
<i>We're going to be busy for a minute.</i>

01:50:46.082 --> 01:50:47.959
All right, all right, all right. Come on.

01:50:48.751 --> 01:50:51.379
Let's focus. We're only halfway there.

01:50:52.714 --> 01:50:54.632
Yeah, we've got it from here.
Thank you, guys.

01:50:54.632 --> 01:50:57.719
Places. Places, everyone. Look sharp.

01:50:57.719 --> 01:50:58.970
Let's look sharp!

01:50:58.970 --> 01:51:01.264
Edvard, Edvard, off the stage.
You're killing me.

01:51:01.264 --> 01:51:05.184
Edvard, we are done. Uh-uh.
You're done. No more tweaking.

01:51:05.184 --> 01:51:07.520
- What are you, the repeater?
- No, I'm not the repeater.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.647
This is the system we created
before you got here.

01:51:16.821 --> 01:51:18.364
<i>Camera is coming down.</i>

01:51:25.204 --> 01:51:29.834
Three, two, one, and action.

01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:35.131
<i>And we're getting a picture on the TV.</i>

01:51:36.132 --> 01:51:37.967
<i>You got a good picture, huh?</i>

01:51:37.967 --> 01:51:40.845
<i>There's a great deal of contrast in it.</i>

01:51:40.845 --> 01:51:42.972
<i>Roger, TV circuit breaker's in,</i>

01:51:44.223 --> 01:51:45.892
<i>and read you loud and clear.</i>

01:51:47.393 --> 01:51:48.603
<i>Roger.</i>

01:51:53.858 --> 01:51:55.985
<i>Okay. Will you verify the position</i>

01:51:56.611 --> 01:51:58.571
<i>the opening I ought to have on the camera?</i>

01:51:58.571 --> 01:51:59.864
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:51:59.864 --> 01:52:02.700
Armstrong, prepare to disembark.

01:52:04.077 --> 01:52:05.328
<i>Your visor.</i>

01:52:09.248 --> 01:52:11.250
<i>I am opening the door for egress.</i>

01:52:31.354 --> 01:52:34.023
<i>Okay, Neil,
we can see you coming down the ladder now.</i>

01:52:36.025 --> 01:52:37.944
Okay, left.

01:52:39.654 --> 01:52:41.406
And right.

01:52:43.783 --> 01:52:46.411
Left and right.

01:52:46.411 --> 01:52:49.080
Now, left foot off. Left foot off.

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:52.417
Easy. Easy. Step down.

01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:55.878
And land.

01:52:55.878 --> 01:52:58.339
How do you know
what he's gonna do ahead of time?

01:52:58.339 --> 01:53:02.051
NASA rehearsed all of this,
and Kelly appropriated it.

01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:04.262
Stole it.

01:53:04.929 --> 01:53:06.556
I knew I hired the right people.

01:53:07.932 --> 01:53:09.350
Okay, here we go.

01:53:12.812 --> 01:53:14.814
It's seamless. It's incredible.

01:53:16.024 --> 01:53:18.109
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

01:53:18.609 --> 01:53:22.989
<i>The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about one or two inches,</i>

01:53:22.989 --> 01:53:28.619
<i>although the surface appears to be very,
very fine-grained as you get close to it.</i>

01:53:28.619 --> 01:53:33.166
<i>It's almost like a powder.
Down there, it's very fine.</i>

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.252
<i>I'm gonna step off the LEM now.</i>

01:53:42.216 --> 01:53:44.802
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

01:53:48.306 --> 01:53:51.726
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

01:53:57.148 --> 01:53:59.484
We could have spent years coming up
with something that good.

01:54:00.693 --> 01:54:01.778
Yeah.

01:54:03.655 --> 01:54:05.573
Was that in the script?

01:54:06.074 --> 01:54:07.033
No.

01:54:08.368 --> 01:54:09.535
That's a good line.

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.919
<i>It's a very simple matter
to hop down from one step to the next.</i>

01:54:18.419 --> 01:54:20.254
<i>Neil is now unveiling the plaque.</i>

01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:23.341
<i>"Here man, from the planet Earth,</i>

01:54:23.341 --> 01:54:28.471
<i>first set foot upon the moon,
July 1969 AD.</i>

01:54:28.471 --> 01:54:31.015
<i>We came in peace for all mankind."</i>

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.895
<i>You ready for the camera?</i>

01:54:35.895 --> 01:54:39.315
<i>Neil, this is Houston.
The field of view is okay.</i>

01:54:39.315 --> 01:54:42.026
<i>We'd like you to aim it
a little bit more to the right. Over.</i>

01:54:42.527 --> 01:54:43.611
<i>Okay.</i>

01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:46.114
<i>Too much to the right.</i>

01:54:46.114 --> 01:54:48.449
<i>Can you bring it back left about,
four or five degrees?</i>

01:54:53.621 --> 01:54:55.289
<i>Okay. That looks good, Neil.</i>

01:54:56.916 --> 01:54:59.419
<i>Columbia, Columbia,
this is Houston, AOS. Over.</i>

01:54:59.419 --> 01:55:01.921
<i>Neil Armstrong
has been on the lunar surface now</i>

01:55:01.921 --> 01:55:03.047
<i>almost 45 minutes.</i>

01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:06.009
<i>Tranquility Base, this is Houston.</i>

01:55:06.009 --> 01:55:08.469
<i>Could we get both of you on the camera
for a minute, please?</i>

01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:13.266
<i>The President of the United States would
like to say a few words to you. Over.</i>

01:55:13.266 --> 01:55:15.184
<i>That would be an honor.</i>

01:55:15.685 --> 01:55:17.687
<i>All right, go ahead, Mr. President.</i>

01:55:17.687 --> 01:55:18.771
<i>This is Houston. Out.</i>

01:55:18.771 --> 01:55:20.565
<i>Hello, Neil and Buzz.</i>

01:55:21.274 --> 01:55:25.570
<i>I am talking to you by telephone
from the Oval Room at the White House...</i>

01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:27.739
They have Secret Service
all over this place.

01:55:27.739 --> 01:55:31.993
<i>...and this certainly has to be the most
historic telephone call ever made.</i>

01:55:33.328 --> 01:55:34.954
<i>And as you talk to us...</i>

01:55:34.954 --> 01:55:37.457
He actually reminds me a lot of you.

01:55:37.457 --> 01:55:40.126
Do not say that.
No, don't even joke about that.

01:55:40.710 --> 01:55:45.131
We're still holding while
the president drones on. Don't move.

01:55:45.131 --> 01:55:46.841
Armstrong, I'm watching you the most.

01:55:46.841 --> 01:55:51.179
<i>For one priceless moment
in the whole history of man...</i>

01:55:51.179 --> 01:55:52.764
<i>Kennedy, let's go direct.</i>

01:55:55.224 --> 01:55:57.393
<i>Cole, are you receiving picture?</i>

01:55:57.393 --> 01:55:59.187
<i>The video feed light isn't on up here.</i>

01:55:59.187 --> 01:56:02.357
What do you mean, Neil? It's not working?

01:56:02.357 --> 01:56:04.400
<i>You tell me. Do you see picture?</i>

01:56:04.901 --> 01:56:07.320
<i>We're getting a power surge warning
on the camera.</i>

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:09.781
<i>I think it crapped out.
Can you still see us?</i>

01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:11.783
Yeah, I can still see you.

01:56:13.618 --> 01:56:14.786
One second, Neil.

01:56:15.286 --> 01:56:17.163
Neil's saying the video feed light
isn't on up there.

01:56:17.163 --> 01:56:18.498
Are you sure that camera's working?

01:56:18.498 --> 01:56:20.708
I installed the new part.
It should be working just fine but--

01:56:20.708 --> 01:56:23.127
- But what?
- But I-- I was in a rush.

01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:25.713
Shit.

01:56:29.509 --> 01:56:30.510
What's wrong?

01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:33.888
We're not sure that the camera
on the LEM is working.

01:56:33.888 --> 01:56:36.516
<i>I think that's your feed broadcasting.</i>

01:56:37.225 --> 01:56:40.144
<i>Does the feed on your TV
look like your set?</i>

01:56:42.939 --> 01:56:44.816
I-- I can't tell if it's us.

01:56:44.816 --> 01:56:47.986
Test it. Have one of your agents give
a little wave or something.

01:56:48.861 --> 01:56:51.447
I can't. Everyone is here.

01:57:08.631 --> 01:57:10.758
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:57:12.385 --> 01:57:14.012
He is two inches away
from being on that screen.

01:57:14.012 --> 01:57:15.096
It's-- It's one inch.

01:57:15.096 --> 01:57:16.848
Is that in your goddamn script?

01:57:19.183 --> 01:57:20.685
Joseph, were there new pages?

01:57:20.685 --> 01:57:23.438
<i>...representing not only the United States</i>

01:57:23.438 --> 01:57:25.732
<i>but men of peace of all nations...</i>

01:57:30.028 --> 01:57:32.655
Mischief! Oh, God.
Kitty, kitty! Pss, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:57:32.655 --> 01:57:33.865
Mischief! Mischief!

01:57:33.865 --> 01:57:35.325
Where are you going?

01:57:36.284 --> 01:57:37.869
- Mischief. Mischief.
- K-- Kelly.

01:57:37.869 --> 01:57:39.412
- Come here.
- The cat?

01:57:39.412 --> 01:57:40.830
Come here. Come here. Come here.

01:57:49.339 --> 01:57:50.548
Do you know this cat?

01:57:53.009 --> 01:57:54.052
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

01:57:54.052 --> 01:57:56.888
Come here, you sweet--
Come here, you little bitch.

01:57:56.888 --> 01:57:58.431
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:57:58.431 --> 01:58:00.058
- Come here, you!
- No!

01:58:02.268 --> 01:58:05.188
Kelly, what the hell is going on
over there?

01:58:05.188 --> 01:58:06.481
<i>Kelly? Kelly?</i>

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.025
Go round the back!

01:58:09.025 --> 01:58:10.735
Mischief! Mischief!

01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:13.112
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

01:58:13.112 --> 01:58:15.281
Catch him! Catch him! Go, go.

01:58:15.281 --> 01:58:16.532
Let's go! Come on.

01:58:19.118 --> 01:58:20.995
Come here. It's okay.

01:58:20.995 --> 01:58:22.830
Mischief. Just come here.

01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:24.248
Just shut up. Just shut up!

01:58:24.248 --> 01:58:27.335
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, little baby. You know me.

01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:29.921
No!

01:58:44.268 --> 01:58:45.853
<i>And thank you very much</i>

01:58:45.853 --> 01:58:47.772
<i>and I look forward,
all of us look forward,</i>

01:58:47.772 --> 01:58:49.857
<i>to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.</i>

01:58:53.486 --> 01:58:55.488
<i>I look forward to that very much, sir.</i>

01:58:58.741 --> 01:58:59.993
Those are your guys, Cole.

01:59:00.535 --> 01:59:02.662
Yes! Those are our guys!

01:59:06.708 --> 01:59:08.501
Yes. I know you know that.

01:59:08.501 --> 01:59:10.795
Just reminding everybody
what we're doing here today.

01:59:11.796 --> 01:59:12.964
Those are our guys.

01:59:13.965 --> 01:59:15.049
Carry on.

01:59:21.222 --> 01:59:22.890
What am I looking at here?

01:59:22.890 --> 01:59:24.559
That's the moon.

01:59:26.269 --> 01:59:27.812
<i>Neil, this is Houston.</i>

01:59:27.812 --> 01:59:29.397
<i>Did you get the Hasselblad magazine...</i>

01:59:29.397 --> 01:59:30.648
That's really the moon?

01:59:30.648 --> 01:59:34.235
<i>Yes, I did. And we got about...</i>

01:59:34.235 --> 01:59:36.946
- Jesus, it looks fake.
- <i>...I'd say 20 pounds of...</i>

01:59:36.946 --> 01:59:40.533
<i>...carefully selected,
if not documented samples.</i>

01:59:41.659 --> 01:59:44.829
<i>Houston. Roger. Well done. Out.</i>

01:59:44.829 --> 01:59:48.249
<i>Unofficial time
off the surface at 111:37:32.</i>

01:59:54.047 --> 01:59:56.633
I never thought I would see
the moon up close.

01:59:56.633 --> 01:59:57.717
Me neither, Walter.

02:00:04.766 --> 02:00:06.851
- I didn't get it. Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

02:00:06.851 --> 02:00:08.978
- Not like last time.
- No. Don't point it at us.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.481
In Polish, we call it <i>"na zdrowie."</i>

02:00:11.481 --> 02:00:14.108
- All right. <i>Na zdrowie.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay. Kelly.

02:00:14.108 --> 02:00:15.735
- Kelly. Kelly.
- It's getting a little better.

02:00:15.735 --> 02:00:19.030
- Yes? What?
- Christ, just say it. Just say it once.

02:00:19.614 --> 02:00:21.074
You are the best director I know.

02:00:21.074 --> 02:00:24.160
I am. Now, I know
we're not supposed to talk about this,

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.704
but, Kelly, this would be so great
on my résumé if I-- Just feels--

02:00:26.704 --> 02:00:29.165
Anyone mentions this to anyone,

02:00:29.165 --> 02:00:32.669
you will spend the rest of your life
in a dark, dank prison cell

02:00:32.669 --> 02:00:34.337
on a nameless island.

02:00:36.422 --> 02:00:38.800
Now, to wash down the bubbly,

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.637
on behalf of the US government,
have a little scotch.

02:00:42.637 --> 02:00:44.013
Edvard.

02:00:44.013 --> 02:00:45.223
I'll take one of those.

02:00:45.223 --> 02:00:48.267
I had a billion-dollar TV show
for an audience of one.

02:00:48.267 --> 02:00:49.894
Hope you enjoyed it.

02:00:50.395 --> 02:00:53.064
- Cheers.
- It was a perfect failure.

02:00:53.064 --> 02:00:55.775
- That's right. Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:00:59.737 --> 02:01:01.322
Can I talk with you a moment?

02:01:03.533 --> 02:01:06.577
Not many people have gone
against my orders

02:01:06.577 --> 02:01:07.996
and lived to talk about it.

02:01:07.996 --> 02:01:11.708
Then again, not many people
have saved my ass.

02:01:11.708 --> 02:01:15.837
It would've been a real doozy to explain
how the cat ended up on the moon.

02:01:16.838 --> 02:01:18.923
You're a goddamn American hero.

02:01:20.466 --> 02:01:21.467
Great job.

02:01:23.678 --> 02:01:26.222
Now, this place is crawling with press.

02:01:26.222 --> 02:01:30.518
So, we can't really clear anything out
until after splashdown.

02:01:30.518 --> 02:01:35.106
In the meantime, shred any documents
associated with the shoot.

02:01:35.982 --> 02:01:38.693
Your name will be wiped
from the history books.

02:01:38.693 --> 02:01:41.112
The story, rewritten.

02:01:43.406 --> 02:01:45.158
- Then I'm free to go.
- You are.

02:01:46.492 --> 02:01:52.081
Although, I could use someone like you
for an upcoming project.

02:01:53.791 --> 02:01:54.917
No, thanks.

02:01:54.917 --> 02:01:57.587
Suit yourself. Hard to get, but okay.

02:01:59.088 --> 02:02:05.136
If you ever need me... just holler.
I'm probably listening.

02:02:12.685 --> 02:02:13.686
Moe.

02:02:16.064 --> 02:02:17.940
Are there really aliens out there?

02:02:20.693 --> 02:02:22.195
They walk among us.

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:29.118
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

02:02:30.119 --> 02:02:34.207
<i>Let's play among the stars</i>

02:02:34.874 --> 02:02:40.505
<i>Let me see what spring is like on
Jupiter and Mars</i>

02:02:40.505 --> 02:02:42.423
<i>A quarter of a million miles.</i>

02:02:42.423 --> 02:02:44.884
<i>Just think of it as, Neil Armstrong said,</i>

02:02:44.884 --> 02:02:48.388
<i>the first words
as man stepped foot on the moon,</i>

02:02:48.388 --> 02:02:52.934
<i>"A small step for man,
a giant leap for mankind."</i>

02:02:53.768 --> 02:02:55.937
<i>And a day that can never come again.</i>

02:02:55.937 --> 02:02:59.273
<i>A day that shall forever live in history,
as will those words,</i>

02:02:59.273 --> 02:03:01.317
<i>which will be memorized by schoolboys...</i>

02:03:01.317 --> 02:03:04.946
Armstrong, you've got a future.
Not in acting. My God, no.

02:03:06.114 --> 02:03:08.366
Well, Kelly, Patty-- Patty, right?

02:03:08.366 --> 02:03:10.034
- My name is Ruby.
- Uh-huh.

02:03:10.034 --> 02:03:11.786
- We did it.
- No, we didn't.

02:03:22.005 --> 02:03:23.464
<i>This is landward here.</i>

02:03:23.464 --> 02:03:26.134
<i>Swim One has Apollo visual.</i>

02:03:26.134 --> 02:03:28.594
<i>Well, if it's coming down nine miles away,</i>

02:03:28.594 --> 02:03:31.973
<i>that's just going to be
at the outer limit of visibility...</i>

02:03:31.973 --> 02:03:33.766
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

02:03:49.949 --> 02:03:51.784
<i>They're back from the moon.</i>

02:03:51.784 --> 02:03:54.412
<i>Astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins</i>

02:03:54.412 --> 02:03:57.915
<i>landing in the Pacific Ocean,
southwest of Hawaii.</i>

02:04:03.921 --> 02:04:06.215
I guess you deserve a cigarette.

02:04:08.009 --> 02:04:10.511
- Buddy.
- Yeah, yeah. I...

02:04:13.431 --> 02:04:17.185
I didn't wanna lose it in there. You know?

02:04:18.686 --> 02:04:20.855
You know, I know you didn't want
the camera up there,

02:04:20.855 --> 02:04:24.275
but, man, seeing that was...

02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:28.071
It was life-changing.

02:04:29.197 --> 02:04:31.616
- We did it.
- We did. We did, man.

02:04:33.534 --> 02:04:36.245
Hey, it's 1969, right?
We got it in before the decade.

02:04:36.245 --> 02:04:39.248
- I know. Not a moment to spare.
- Yeah, we did.

02:04:39.248 --> 02:04:41.000
- Look who it is.
- Hey.

02:04:43.169 --> 02:04:45.254
- Go. Get out of here.
- Yeah.

02:04:47.298 --> 02:04:50.134
Listen,
it's not too late for you either, kid.

02:04:51.219 --> 02:04:52.595
- Thank you, Henry.
- All right.

02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:57.141
Hey.

02:04:59.435 --> 02:05:00.645
We did it.

02:05:02.438 --> 02:05:03.815
Hey, guys.

02:05:03.815 --> 02:05:05.149
Sent a man to the moon.

02:05:21.541 --> 02:05:22.542
You know...

02:05:28.214 --> 02:05:29.507
I never did catch your name.

02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:38.182
Winnie.

02:05:40.977 --> 02:05:43.730
Winnie. Nice to meet you, Winnie.

02:05:46.983 --> 02:05:49.027
You know, the Russians,
they-- they're saying

02:05:49.027 --> 02:05:51.404
that we shot the whole thing
on a soundstage.

02:05:51.404 --> 02:05:53.823
I wonder where they got
a crazy idea like that.

02:05:55.074 --> 02:05:56.451
Who cares what they think?

02:05:57.994 --> 02:06:00.830
Truth is still the truth
even if nobody believes it.

02:06:02.749 --> 02:06:05.335
Lie is still a lie
even if everybody believes it.

02:06:08.087 --> 02:06:09.672
You know, you really nailed this.

02:06:11.924 --> 02:06:13.843
All the way down to the lunar dust.

02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:17.639
Too bad it's all fake.

02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:25.521
Was that fake?

02:06:27.690 --> 02:06:29.525
No, that felt very real.

02:07:49.272 --> 02:07:54.819
<i>Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...
Ignition sequence, five...</i>
