I didn't have a chance.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.603
Elevate, don't denigrate.

34:00.777 --> 34:02.562
That's what I tell 'em--

34:02.736 --> 34:04.694
my kids.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.916
What do you think
the Italians tell their kids?

34:09.090 --> 34:10.657
I... I don't know.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.094
Yeah, yeah, but you...
you see it, though, right?

34:13.268 --> 34:15.227
What they're doing?

34:16.793 --> 34:19.405
Call a man an animal,
keep him in the dirt.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.930
But what if he don't grunt?

34:23.104 --> 34:25.106
What if he don't honk?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.108
What if he walks tall

34:27.282 --> 34:29.241
and stays a man?

34:30.981 --> 34:32.722
Come on.
You-you know what that is.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.594
You boys do it all the time.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.857
No, not me.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.990
You get in the dirt yourself

34:40.165 --> 34:43.342
and you show him
how to be an animal!

34:43.516 --> 34:46.388
You show him how to hate,
you show him how to be cruel.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.521
You kill his friends!

34:50.697 --> 34:52.786
Murder his child.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.795
Boss, I...

35:01.969 --> 35:04.058
I didn't know. I...

35:07.105 --> 35:09.368
They can't rise to our level,

35:09.542 --> 35:12.371
so they got to drag us down
to theirs.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.287
But it's a trap.

35:18.246 --> 35:21.554
It's a trap,

35:21.728 --> 35:24.818
'cause if I get in the dirt
like them...

35:26.863 --> 35:28.909
...that means
they were right the whole time.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.346
[Opal clears throat, sniffles]

35:31.520 --> 35:33.479
See, Opal right here...

35:36.046 --> 35:38.658
...he's kind of
an eye-for-an-eye type brother.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.357
But he's not responsible
for this family.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.490
Kill or be killed.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.754
Win or lose.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.104
It ain't complex.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.413
You know what I think?

35:54.587 --> 35:57.459
Every country has
its own type of criminal.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.809
In America,
we got the confidence man.

35:59.983 --> 36:03.117
Snake oil salesman, grifter.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.251
He don't rob you as much as
trick you into robbing yourself.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.428
See, 'cause in America,

36:09.602 --> 36:11.778
people want to believe.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.129
They got that dream.

36:17.131 --> 36:21.048
And a dreamer, you can fleece.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.096
Boss, I... I'm sorry.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.098
I-I... I don't understand.

36:28.273 --> 36:31.276
[muttering]

36:37.282 --> 36:39.632
He wants me to kill his brother.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.636
Josto.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.555
But I ain't gonna do it.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.473
What are you gonna do?

36:56.257 --> 36:58.303
No.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.002
What are we gonna do?

37:02.176 --> 37:04.309
[Odis exhales softly]

37:05.788 --> 37:07.747
[Gaetano sighs]

37:30.378 --> 37:32.206
[coughing]

37:32.380 --> 37:34.339
[door opens]

37:41.911 --> 37:43.870
[Gaetano groaning]

37:56.926 --> 37:58.885
This thing is done.

38:03.890 --> 38:06.806
Your brother gave me
the stockyards, the trucking.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.549
Equal partners.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.074
If...

38:16.032 --> 38:17.730
...I kill you.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.999
You don't like that?

38:29.089 --> 38:31.918
Family is family.
[groans]

38:32.092 --> 38:34.224
Maybe.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.705
But nobody in my family's
trying to kill me.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.620
Enough talking.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.057
If you're going to kill me,
kill me.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.277
[Gaetano panting]

38:44.409 --> 38:46.411
Nah.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.545
Let him go.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.286
What?

38:52.460 --> 38:55.855
Tell your brother
the stockyards are ours now.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.249
[grunts]

38:59.424 --> 39:01.513
[panting]

39:04.690 --> 39:06.126
OMIE:
See you in the funny papers.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.303
[exhales]

39:09.477 --> 39:10.870
[grunts]

39:18.094 --> 39:19.835
You're on the road.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.924
I want that Calamita dead.
You hear me?

39:22.098 --> 39:24.536
Already done.
He just ain't lying down yet.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.897
Sure hope you know
what you're doing.

42:11.093 --> 42:12.399
MAN:
Now I get it.

42:12.573 --> 42:13.966
[rooster crows]
