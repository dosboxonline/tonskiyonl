I won a chain saw.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.668
What?
What are you talking about?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.378
Some lady up the block is giving away

00:45.462 --> 00:47.255
all of her husband's stuff
'cause he shot himself

00:47.339 --> 00:49.007
-in the face.
-Oh, my God!

00:49.090 --> 00:51.259
I've seen that lady.
He did the right thing.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.969
That's also how we got this couch.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.346
Basically everything in this house

00:54.429 --> 00:56.639
is Christmas suicide furniture.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.683
Donna, they had a bullhorn.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.644
I don't know why, but they had a bullhorn.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.772
DONNA:
Cleveland, it's time for lunch.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.732
What do I want? Sammich!

01:05.815 --> 01:07.650
When do I want it? Now!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.904
♪ I ain't eatin' no Lipton soup. ♪

01:15.575 --> 01:18.912
So, kids, Bonnie just told me
about the neatest thing.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.914
It's called a podcast.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.500
I guess it's like a-a radio show
on your phone.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.794
Have you heard of these?
Podcasts.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.088
Yeah, Mom, we know what podcasts are.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.798
Huh. (chuckles)

01:29.881 --> 01:32.717
I guess these types of things
take a while to reach the moms.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.803
I'll have to let Bonnie know.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.523
(dialing)

01:46.606 --> 01:48.733
(beep)

01:48.817 --> 01:50.694
BONNIE:
Wow, really?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.821
Mom, Stewie needs his sausage cut

01:52.904 --> 01:54.155
and his butter spread.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.990
Here, let me get that for you, buddy.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.076
(buzzing)

01:59.577 --> 02:00.954
(screams)

02:07.961 --> 02:10.672
There you go.
Eat up, little guy.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.383
Damn it, Peter.
You ruined Stewie's chair.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.260
(pager vibrates)

02:15.343 --> 02:17.929
And Bonnie wants to know
what all the noise is.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.352
-Amazing.
-Ooh.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.563
-Wow, it's Willem Dafoe!
-That's right.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.940
Since Willem Dafoe
has more bones in his face

02:29.024 --> 02:31.026
than most people have
in their entire body,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.528
he's perfect for carving,
'cause the angles are so sharp.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.696
It's beautiful, Peter.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.531
Yeah, I just love William Dafoe.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.241
It's not "William," it's "Willem."

02:38.324 --> 02:39.659
Yeah, that's what I said.
"William."

02:39.743 --> 02:41.661
He was in Spider-Man with Kristin Dunst.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.122
-Kirsten Dunst.
-Right. Kirsten Dunce.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.916
-It's not "Dunce," it's "Dunst."
-Yeah, Kristin Dunce.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.210
In the movie,
she dated William Dafoe's son.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.213
Spell it, Joe!
Spell what you are saying right now.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.548
Well, I'll give it a shot.

02:53.631 --> 02:57.886
K-Y- R-H...

02:59.304 --> 03:01.681
Look, there's a reason
I became a cop and not a spellman.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.433
-A what?
-A spellman.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.643
-"Spellman" is not a thing, Joe!
-Sure it is.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.979
Fireman, longshoreman, spellman.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.606
Stop me when I'm wrong.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.025
-He's getting too many right.
-Now I'm starting to think

03:12.108 --> 03:13.360
there is such a thing as a spellman.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.694
PETER:
Hey, guys. Check it out.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.571
-It's Groot.
-Oh, yeah.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.491
-From that Marble movie.
-(sighs)

03:23.620 --> 03:25.121
What are you doing?!

03:25.205 --> 03:28.166
-Turn that chain saw off!
-Not a chance, Lois.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.168
You know how hard it was
to get that thing started?

03:30.251 --> 03:33.797
It was even worse than
trying to cover anything with Saran Wrap.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.680
(crinkling)

03:43.640 --> 03:45.058
(groans)

03:48.728 --> 03:50.313
(sighs)

04:01.157 --> 04:02.742

04:06.162 --> 04:08.164

04:13.336 --> 04:14.754

04:31.855 --> 04:33.440

04:35.859 --> 04:37.444
(groans):
Oh.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.463
(sighs)

05:02.802 --> 05:04.304
(sighs)

05:05.805 --> 05:08.308
(grunting)

05:20.820 --> 05:22.155
(sighs) Perfect.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.824
Can't wait to throw that out in two weeks.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.910
(chain saw buzzing)

05:34.584 --> 05:37.087
Peter!
What's going on out here?!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.464
Oh, hey, Lois.
I'm just hollowing out this tree

05:39.547 --> 05:40.882
for the Keebler elves to live in.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.592
-Awesome!
-I know, right?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.386
Gonna get us a lifetime supply

05:44.469 --> 05:47.597
of fresh-baked-but-still-stale
supermarket cookies.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.433
All right, time for a little elfin magic.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.360
Ow! Oh! My arm!
Oh, son of a bitch!

06:00.443 --> 06:02.612
(wood crackling)

06:10.245 --> 06:12.330
-Oh, my God!
-Mom, look.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.416
(chittering)

06:15.792 --> 06:18.837
Aw. Poor thing
must've been living in the tree.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.547
(chittering)

06:20.630 --> 06:23.299
-And its foot seems hurt.
-It's even worse than that.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.386
It looks like the tree landed
on its parents and killed them.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.054
Nobody touch the smooshed squirrel bodies!

06:28.138 --> 06:30.765
Ooh, I got to get my camera.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.476
That girl is one giant red flag.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.812
Stewie, this squirrel needs help.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.483
I wonder if... m-maybe
I could take care of it.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.402
I don't know if you should
do it on your own.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.779
-Could be a lot of work.
-(chittering)

06:44.863 --> 06:47.032
Would... would you do it with me?

06:47.115 --> 06:48.825
Well, I-I don't think it...

06:48.908 --> 06:51.286
(chittering)

06:51.369 --> 06:53.788
♪ ♪

06:55.540 --> 06:58.335
You know what?
I think that's a marvelous idea, Chris.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.004
I daresay we would
make outstanding parents

07:01.087 --> 07:03.631
-to this squirrel.
-Hey there, Griffin boys.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.509
I saw this tree go down.
Any loot in it?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.553
Elven treasures?

07:08.636 --> 07:10.597
Uh, no.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.391
Hey, Donna, the tree's just regular.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.810
DONNA:
Go to work, Cleveland!

07:22.067 --> 07:24.152
Well, somebody's getting big and strong.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.945
Did you hear that one vet technician

07:26.029 --> 07:27.364
say our little squirrel here

07:27.447 --> 07:30.617
was in the 70th percentile
for height and weight?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.619
No. Which vet tech said that?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.079
The one with the neck tattoo.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.623
-Which one with the neck tattoo?
-The one we saw

07:36.706 --> 07:38.375
smoking in the parking lot
when we were leaving.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.752
Again, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.796
The one wearing pajama bottoms as pants.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.173
-Sorry, I don't...
-The girl one!

07:45.256 --> 07:47.967
Oh, yeah, with the half-shaved head.
She was nice.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.136
Well, I'll bet this cutie is hungry.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
Wh-What are you doing?

07:55.350 --> 07:57.018
Don't film me. Film the baby.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.020
But you're both so cute.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.147
This role, it-it suits you.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.149
It's like you've been
waiting your whole life

08:03.233 --> 08:04.442
to be this person.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.236
Shush, you're going to make me cry.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.863
-(high-pitched fart)
-Aw! He made a little toot.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.575
That was me.
It was one of my cross-legged ones.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
I should probably stop recording.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.003
Well, if it's your elbow
that's bothering you,

08:23.086 --> 08:25.130
we should start by checking your reflexes.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.631
-(shouts)
-(screams)

08:26.715 --> 08:28.258
-Okay, they seem all right.
-Oh, that's good.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.218
But you got to help me.
My arm really hurts.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.345
It all started after I got a chain saw.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.972
Hmm, is that right?

08:34.055 --> 08:36.641
Well, it sounds to me
like you may have Chain Saw Elbow.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.477
-"Chain Saw Elbow"?
-Yes, it's all explained

08:39.561 --> 08:40.645
in this video.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.230
Hi, I'm Tommy Lee Jones.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.940
Congratulations on suffering

08:44.024 --> 08:46.234
from the coolest arm ailment there is:

08:46.317 --> 08:48.028
Chain Saw Elbow.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.864
As a celebrity dick,
it's always been my passion

08:50.947 --> 08:52.741
to own a ranch in a low-tax state

08:52.824 --> 08:54.701
that I list as my primary residence.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.953
And when I'm not pouting at awards shows,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.496
I'm out in the field cutting firewood

08:58.580 --> 09:00.915
-for a staged Instagram post.
-(camera clicks)

09:00.999 --> 09:03.960
Sometimes I overdo it,
end up with Chain Saw Elbow.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.421
Now here's fellow ranch owner Dennis Quaid

09:06.504 --> 09:09.007
to discuss the dangers of Tractor Ass.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.885
So, you have Tractor Ass.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.471
Okay, so how much
synthetic opioid do you need?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.848
I'm trying to prescribe enough
to earn a fanny pack.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.433
A-Aren't there any other options?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.643
Well, there's a trucker hat,
but those look stupid on me.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.688
You know, sometimes joint pain
is connected to back issues.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.940
Have you ever
had a chiropractic adjustment?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.400
-What's that?
-It's a procedure

09:27.484 --> 09:29.402
where a guy
who couldn't get into medical school

09:29.486 --> 09:31.363
-tries to rip your head off.
-Does it work?

09:31.446 --> 09:32.739
If you believe it works.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.324
It's kind of like the Polar Express.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.701
-Let's do it!
-Okay, I'll give it a shot.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.953
But this type of thing
is usually done in strip malls

09:39.037 --> 09:41.247
next to a Little Caesars.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.752
-(grunting)
-(bones crackling)

09:50.757 --> 09:52.133
(gasps)

09:53.176 --> 09:54.594
Holy crap! What happened?

09:54.678 --> 09:57.055
Well, I think we simply
found your true height.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.641
Before years of poor posture
and wear and tear

09:59.724 --> 10:02.268
-crushed your spirit and your spine.
-Wow.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.604
Mr. Griffin, let's discuss risk factors.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.815
Do you lead a lifestyle that's sedentary?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.233
Pet Sedentary?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.151
I'm saying you need
to strengthen your core

10:10.235 --> 10:11.569
and exercise regularly.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.364
-Is that the hat?
-Stupid, right?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.703
I know the holidays are still months away,

10:19.786 --> 10:20.995
but I was just so excited

10:21.079 --> 10:23.248
to take our family Christmas card photo.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.584
(chuckles):
Are you kidding? I love it.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.919
You know what, Chris?

10:28.003 --> 10:30.839
I feel like I'm ready to start trying...

10:30.922 --> 10:33.633
to find another squirrel.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.718
What?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.178
Nothing. I just...

10:37.262 --> 10:39.973
I just hit the lottery when I met you.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.182
Here's your photo.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.308
It's the only one where the squirrel

10:42.392 --> 10:43.727
wasn't trying to bite your hand.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.895
-(chuckles): Ooh!
-Oh, I love it!

10:45.979 --> 10:48.189
-How much do we owe you?
-It's fine. Just keep it.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.316
Sears just closed forever.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.990
Whoa! Peter, what happened?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.825
Did you tease that witch again?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.243
No, I got a back adjustment.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.203
Turns out I've been this tall all along.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.456
-You don't say.
-Well, that's amazing.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.207
Why are you still wearing the same pants?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.626
I don't know.
I only get pants at Christmas, so...

11:08.710 --> 11:10.170
I'll get pants at Christmas.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.214
-So, how is it being that tall?
-It's okay, I guess.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.967
Although I've noticed
I'm a lot more clumsy in the bedroom.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.761
(bed creaking)

11:17.844 --> 11:18.762
(lamp shatters)

11:18.845 --> 11:20.096
PETER:
I'm so sorry.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.515
You two keep going.
I'm gonna clean this up.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.062
(chittering)

11:27.145 --> 11:29.981
Stewie! Stewie, come quick!

11:30.065 --> 11:31.983
(gasps) Its first steps?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.443
We've got to film this!

That's going on Instagram right now.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.376

That we're totally cliché?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.136
-How about "Step by Step"?
-New Kids on the Block?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.971
No. The Eddie Rabbitt version.
