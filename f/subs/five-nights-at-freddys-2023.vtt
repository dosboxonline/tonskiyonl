49:13.745 --> 49:15.163
It's nice to meet you.

49:16.998 --> 49:20.126
What, um...
what are you doing here?

49:20.126 --> 49:22.962
- Somebody broke into Freddy's.
- What?

49:22.962 --> 49:24.881
Wh-What-what happened?

49:24.881 --> 49:27.258
Recognize these?

49:28.677 --> 49:30.345
Look, it's not
what you think, okay?

49:30.345 --> 49:32.305
Th-Those are--
They're sleeping pills.

49:32.305 --> 49:34.015
- They help me sleep.
- I know what they are, Mike.

49:34.015 --> 49:35.350
It's written on the bottle.

49:36.685 --> 49:38.645
News flash:
If you're too whacked out

49:38.645 --> 49:40.188
to remember to lock
a friggin' door,

49:40.188 --> 49:42.399
accident or not, you're liable.

49:42.399 --> 49:44.234
It's called
criminal negligence.

49:44.234 --> 49:46.653
(scoffs)
You wouldn't understand.

49:46.653 --> 49:48.196
Well, then help me.

49:48.196 --> 49:50.240
'Cause the moment
I file that report,

49:50.240 --> 49:53.034
it's out of my hands.

49:57.038 --> 49:59.374
You want to take a walk?

50:03.044 --> 50:05.755
So I used to have a brother.

50:08.008 --> 50:10.051
His name was Garrett.

50:11.386 --> 50:13.847
(sighs) And when I was...

50:13.847 --> 50:16.349
about 12,

50:16.349 --> 50:18.768
he was, uh, he was taken.

50:20.145 --> 50:22.480
And I was there
when it happened.

50:24.315 --> 50:26.026
They never found
the guy who did it,

50:26.026 --> 50:27.652
and they never found
my brother.

50:32.866 --> 50:36.995
So there's this theory that,
uh, we can't forget things.

50:36.995 --> 50:39.998
Basically, it says that
every single thing that you see

50:39.998 --> 50:42.792
in your entire life,
down to the tiniest of details,

50:42.792 --> 50:44.711
gets stored inside of you.

50:44.711 --> 50:48.048
You just have to know
how to look.

50:48.048 --> 50:50.216
Your brother--

50:50.216 --> 50:52.344
you think you saw who took him?

50:52.344 --> 50:54.346
I know I did.

50:54.346 --> 50:56.848
And I know that he's in here,
but he's just-- he's--

50:56.848 --> 50:58.058
It's buried.

50:58.058 --> 51:00.060
So every night, I dream,

51:00.060 --> 51:01.478
and I go back
to that same memory,

51:01.478 --> 51:03.730
and I-I search for details.

51:03.730 --> 51:06.649
For any little thing
that got overlooked.

51:12.489 --> 51:14.032
Yeah.

51:14.032 --> 51:16.576
And that's usually the part
where people tell me I'm crazy.

51:18.745 --> 51:20.789
I know what crazy
looks like, Mike.

51:20.789 --> 51:22.749
This isn't it.

51:22.749 --> 51:24.793
Not even close.

51:25.794 --> 51:28.338
And these?

51:28.338 --> 51:30.715
I mean, going back
to the same dream,

51:30.715 --> 51:32.425
the same place
night after night,

51:32.425 --> 51:35.095
it's not easy,
so the-the pills help.

51:35.095 --> 51:36.346
Some other things,

51:36.346 --> 51:38.264
like familiar sights,
familiar sounds.

51:38.264 --> 51:39.933
"Pining for fun?"

51:41.476 --> 51:43.895

51:43.895 --> 51:46.481
Your sister seems cool.

51:46.481 --> 51:49.025
So it's just the two of you?

51:49.025 --> 51:50.902
Yeah.

51:50.902 --> 51:53.446
Yeah, it's just us.

51:53.446 --> 51:56.616
Our mom died
a little while back.

51:57.701 --> 52:01.329
And Dad,
he couldn't handle it, so...

52:03.164 --> 52:04.582
You know what's crazy is, uh,

52:04.582 --> 52:06.626
when... when Garrett and I
were kids,

52:06.626 --> 52:09.295
they were like
those perfect parents

52:09.295 --> 52:11.339
you'd see on old TV shows.

52:13.008 --> 52:16.302
Yeah, ev-every night,
we would sit down together,

52:16.302 --> 52:17.846
we'd have family dinner,

52:17.846 --> 52:20.640
and we'd hold hands
and say grace, and...

52:21.599 --> 52:23.393
That actually sounds
really nice.

52:23.393 --> 52:28.356
Yeah, at the time,
I thought it was really cheesy.

52:31.026 --> 52:32.944
But then it's gone.

52:36.573 --> 52:40.952
You and Abby,
you still have each other.

52:42.454 --> 52:45.623
From where I sit,
I'd say you're lucky.

52:48.376 --> 52:50.503

52:50.503 --> 52:52.839
