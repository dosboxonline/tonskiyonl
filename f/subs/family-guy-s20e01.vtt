All right, time for 8:15 drop-off.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.499
Now Mommy's on a quick break till 3:30.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.501
Toughest job in the world.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.212
Oh, look, Kylie's mom is out of rehab.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.214
Good morning, little guy.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.717
Hey, Janet, good to see you.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.928
Hey, listen, thank you so much
for your apology email.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.805
An individual one would have been nice,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.183
but one to the whole class was fine, too.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.769
Have a good day, Stewie.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.357
Oh, my God, please be a dog.
Please be a dog.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.694
Ow. Ow...

01:09.778 --> 01:11.529
Oh, my God, it's a kid!

01:11.613 --> 01:14.074
It's Doug! Nice hit, bitch.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.534
Oh, and Elsa underwear.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.412
This day just keeps getting better!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.417
Well, thank you all for coming.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.628
Can I get anyone something to drink?

01:26.711 --> 01:29.047
I'm fine, but Doug's
mother would probably like

01:29.130 --> 01:31.675
three martinis,
and then to have unprotected sex

01:31.758 --> 01:33.051
with her boss at work.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.637
And Doug's father would
love a glass of warm tap water

01:35.720 --> 01:37.722
and to never make more than $30,000 a year

01:37.806 --> 01:39.224
for the rest of his life.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.102
And here we go.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.813
Okay, well, I am just so sorry

01:44.896 --> 01:46.523
about what happened with Doug.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.525
I just didn't see the little guy.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.860
Well, maybe you ought
to get your eyes examined.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.114
I appreciate that
it was an accident, Mrs. Griffin.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.282
But nonetheless, we've retained a lawyer.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.618
Well, there must be some way
short of a lawsuit

01:58.702 --> 01:59.911
we can make this up to you.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.996
Well, this is my weekend with Doug,

02:02.080 --> 02:03.873
but I've got tickets to see Lana Del Rey

02:03.957 --> 02:06.001
with our former nanny Jessica.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.588
She's 24. So as a form of settlement,

02:10.672 --> 02:13.383
maybe this weekend you
can put together a tree house

02:13.466 --> 02:14.718
I don't want to deal with.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.595
Fine. If that's what I have to do
to make this right,

02:17.679 --> 02:20.515
then Peter and my children
will build your son's tree house.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.558
Deal.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.727
All right, I guess now the four men

02:23.810 --> 02:26.104
awkwardly sit here
while my mom gives your mom

02:26.187 --> 02:28.231
a tour of the house
that doesn't deserve one.

02:28.314 --> 02:33.153
And this is a room
adjacent to the room

02:33.236 --> 02:34.237
we were just in.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.489
Ooh, what a fun house.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.162
Okay, Mrs. Griffin, tell me what you see.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.290
Um, I see a cow in a lab coat,

02:45.373 --> 02:47.375
some vultures in a cowboy hat,

02:47.459 --> 02:51.046
and a dog trying to trick a cat
into a clothes dryer.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.715
Just as I thought. You're Far-Sided.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.009
Oh, no. What-what do I do about it?

02:56.092 --> 02:57.552
Oh, well, I'm no doctor, but I would say

02:57.635 --> 02:59.721
you either need to get
glasses or maybe LASIK.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.473
Is that the surgery people get

03:01.556 --> 03:03.141
and then tell everybody they got it?

03:03.224 --> 03:05.602
Yes, it's the veganism
of elective surgery.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.062
If you're unsure of what to do,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.064
here's a video of Radiohead front man

03:09.147 --> 03:11.858
and super weirdo Thom Yorke
to help you decide.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.943
Hello, I'm Thom Yorke.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.237
You might know me from Radiohead

03:16.321 --> 03:19.991
or my passing resemblance
to a melting Tilda Swinton.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.994
Not many people
know that I'm blind in one eye.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.788
Can you guess which one?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.623
- This is awful.
- Wait, just give it a few minutes.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.375
All his stuff starts kind of slow.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.168
Fine, I'll get the LASIK.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.878
Great.
Make an appointment with my nurse.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.214
Now here's a lollipop
from the Sackler family

03:34.297 --> 03:36.007
that says, "Sowwy."

03:37.967 --> 03:40.595
<i>In the future,
we won't even need our eyes.</i>

03:40.679 --> 03:42.389

03:42.472 --> 03:45.225

03:47.852 --> 03:50.230

peaking at number 32 with

03:50.313 --> 03:53.483
"I Hate Computers (Tra-La-La)."

03:58.738 --> 04:00.865
Mrs. Griffin, the surgery was a success.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.784
And by that, I mean the hospital agreed

04:02.867 --> 04:04.202
to take your Discover card.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.204
Plus, we'll get one percent of that back,

04:06.287 --> 04:07.997
which is basically like getting nothing.

04:16.381 --> 04:21.428
Oh, my God... I'm blind.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.263
What do you mean you're blind?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.849
- Y-You can't see me right now?
- No!

04:25.932 --> 04:29.519
But you can still see, like,
the stove and laundry, right?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.146
But, Mom, we got you a balloo...

04:31.229 --> 04:32.647
Shh, shh, shh.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.566
She doesn't know about the balloon.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.235
Don't worry, Lois,
we'll be right by your side

04:37.318 --> 04:39.988
the whole time,
and not outside playing with a balloon.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.828
I love you, balloon.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.747
Oh-oh, oh, no, no!

04:48.830 --> 04:50.373
I'm coming, balloon!

04:53.376 --> 04:55.670
Don't tell your mother about this.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.638
Don't worry, Lois,
I went blind a while back.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.640
It was cool.
They're some of the last people

05:07.724 --> 05:09.100
you can still make fun of.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.353
- Dad!
- It's fine, they won't see this.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.646
Dr. Hartman,
you said there was very little risk

05:13.730 --> 05:15.648
to LASIK, but now I am blind.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.775
How did this happen?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.151
Okay, look, this isn't my fault.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.070
It was Take-Your-Cat-To-Work day.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.372
Dr. Hartman, what does this mean,
you know, for me?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.123
Well, whatever your wife did for you,

05:32.207 --> 05:33.625
you'll now have to do for yourselves.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.669
And until she gets used to her new life,

05:35.752 --> 05:37.337
you'll need to take care of her.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.297
Feed her, bathe her, drive her places.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.175
- They're gone, aren't they?
- They left, yes.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.057
There they are.
I thought we said 10:00 sharp,

05:49.140 --> 05:50.850
but we must have said 10:18.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.520
No one's fault, but going forward,

05:53.603 --> 05:56.523
let's make sure
we respect each other's time, hmm?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.775
- You must be Chris.
- I must?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.152
You know,

06:01.236 --> 06:02.445
Mr. Herbert.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.030
How do you know Mr. Herbert?

06:04.114 --> 06:06.533
We're friends.
Sometimes he comes to my art shows,

06:06.616 --> 06:07.867
and we get ice cream after.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.036
he takes you to the park

06:10.120 --> 06:11.996
where the swings go really high?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.957
- He does.
- Uh-huh.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.084
That'll stop.
And the ice cream?

06:16.167 --> 06:17.544
Don't get used to it.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.714
I've seen a thousand of you.
I've outlasted them.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.340
I'll outlast you.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.593
Okay. Uh, my dad
left a note for you, Mr. Griffin.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.805
"Griffins, build this tree house
for my son.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.266
"He will love it for a year,
until my housekeeper

06:31.349 --> 06:33.852
"moves into it,
even though it doesn't have electricity

06:33.935 --> 06:35.228
"or running water.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.772
She walked here from Guatemala.
She'll be fine."

06:37.856 --> 06:40.400
Let's get started, boys.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.152
Aw, man, this is gonna be more work

06:42.235 --> 06:44.571
than when I built that
Habitat for Sean Hannity.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.781
As you can see,
we've made everything white,

06:46.865 --> 06:47.782
like you requested.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.867
Here's a room to recover

06:48.950 --> 06:49.868
from your sodium headaches,

06:49.951 --> 06:51.036
and on the walls, I painted

06:51.119 --> 06:52.537
some of your most famous quotes.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.830
There's the one where you compared

06:53.913 --> 06:56.082
the homosexual
lifestyle to playing in the sewer,

06:56.166 --> 06:58.418
and there's the one
where you defended Roy Moore.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.045
- Nice.
- Uh-huh.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.464
And here's a room where you can
blame things on an immigrant.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.884
Hey, nothing personal,
I just peddle hate for money.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.097
<i>We now return to Blindflix,</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:13.224
<i>the streaming service for blind people.</i>

07:13.308 --> 07:15.977
I can't believe it's the year 2034,

07:16.061 --> 07:19.105
Earth is uninhabitable,
and we're hurtling through space

07:19.189 --> 07:21.566
to find a place
for humanity to start again.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.236
Thankfully, we are
Chris Evans and Vanessa Hudgens,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.947
and have sexy bodies
that will make beautiful

07:28.031 --> 07:29.866
racially nuanced babies.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.701
I love you, Chris Evans.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.120
I love you, too, Vanessa Hudgens.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.997
Kiss me.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.756
Ah, this show is so sexy.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.132
How you doing, Mom?

07:46.216 --> 07:47.467
Do you need to go poopies?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.886
Meg, please stop asking me that.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.056
I'm sorry, I just...
I hate being so dependent

07:53.139 --> 07:54.766
on other people.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
I feel helpless and worthless.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.855
I get it. I feel helpless
and worthless 24-sevs.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.232
How do you deal with it?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.984
Cutting, minor arson, and sometimes I post

08:05.068 --> 08:06.861
empowerment videos on YouTube.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.446
Empowerment videos?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.615
I thought YouTube went out of business.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.033
Uh, what am I thinking of?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.077
- Circuit City.
- Yes.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.662
Here.
The camera's on.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.581
Just getting your feelings
out will make you feel better.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.377
Oh, okay.
Um, hello.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.254
Uh, my name is Lois Griffin,

08:24.337 --> 08:28.425
and I... am blind.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.511
Uh, I went to the hospital
for a simple surgery

08:31.594 --> 08:33.638
and woke up in the ICU.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.850
But the irony was I couldn't see you.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.436
I couldn't see anyone or anything.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.146
Even the people closest to me

08:41.229 --> 08:43.523
who need to be seen the most.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.404
So now I suppose if I want to see again,

08:49.487 --> 08:51.531
I'll have to listen more

08:51.614 --> 08:54.701
and-and feel more and focus on

08:54.784 --> 08:58.705
what's on the inside
and not what I can see on the outside.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.712
Okay, that's all for now.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.214
Mom, that was incredible.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.632
You really spoke to me.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.177
Who-Who's that?
Is that Lois?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.387
Peter, I'm the one who's blind.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.556
Sorry, I-I'm still getting used to things.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.645
I can't believe Doug's dad texted me

09:22.729 --> 09:24.564
and said we had to
come to Doug's T-ball game

09:24.647 --> 09:25.690
or he was gonna sue us.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.400
Looks like they got Big League Chew.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.362
Yeah, I saw that.
I saw that they got Big League Chew.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.239
Ah, the baseball field.
Good memories.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.950
Lost my v-card here
with Jennifer Jason Leigh

09:36.034 --> 09:37.285
in that dugout right over there.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.578
That was <i>Fast Times.</i>

09:38.661 --> 09:41.706
Yeah, fast for her, maybe.
I took a while.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.005
Excuse me.
What happened to your big trip

09:49.089 --> 09:50.423
to Providence?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.717
Good morning, sports fans.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.553
You ready to witness
the epitome of excellence?

09:55.637 --> 09:56.846
Check this out.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.975
Oh. Ball one.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.733
Look, spaz, hold the bat like this,

10:08.817 --> 10:11.361
and then step into it
as you swing forward.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.534
I did it.
Thanks, Mr. Griffin.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.036
- I'm leaving.
- Come on, Chris.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.289
Don't be mad.
My plans changed.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.582
Oh, hey, Doug.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.376
Are you kidding me?!

10:30.588 --> 10:32.674
Mom, you won't believe what happened.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.551
Your video went viral.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.345
Oh, does that mean Circuit City's back?

10:37.429 --> 10:41.391
No, it means your ICU video
really connected with people.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.269
You're helping people
who feel unseen, Mom.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.855
Like me.
You're everywhere.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.857
Okay, so what am I supposed to do now?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.650
Make another video.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.943
Hi, Lois.
I didn't get a monkey.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.486
Off to see Bananarama.
Bye.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.739
♪ <i>I'm your Venus...</i> ♪

10:55.822 --> 10:58.742
Well, it's not what I thought
it was gonna be either.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.330
Mom, I made some ICU T-shirts.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.584
What's going on?
Who are these people?

11:07.667 --> 11:08.835
My team.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.296
ICU has exploded.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.923
There's ICU Fashion, ICU Skincare,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.926
ICU Health.
It is a gold mine.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.762
Okay, but what does any of this
have to do with

11:18.845 --> 11:20.972
seeing people for who they really are?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.766
Oh, pfft, who cares about that?

11:22.849 --> 11:25.894
I do. ICU was an idea
I could really believe in,

11:25.977 --> 11:27.437
and you're ruining it.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.273
I'm not ruining it, I'm expanding it.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.233
You know, I'm the one who went blind, Meg.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.069
I'm the one who's suffering.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.571
Now the least I can do
is make some money from it.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.114
Now stand back.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.283
It's time to make another video.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.871
Hello, Seers, Lois here.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.458
You know, sometimes
the darkness gets overwhelming,

11:48.541 --> 11:52.879
and that's when
I turn to ICU Essential Oils.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.883
It calms you before sleep,
or you can cook chicken in it.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.649
Oh, my God.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.861
I can see.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.238
Oh, God, but if anybody finds out,

12:18.321 --> 12:20.281
it'll ruin my ICU brand.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.368
Ugh. Peter told me
he'd been doing laundry.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.204
You know, now I'm even
wondering if he lost those 75 pounds

12:26.287 --> 12:27.288
like he said.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.289
What's that, Lois?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.874
I'm just on the spin bike.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.418
Got a good sweat going.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.129
Boy, you're right,
Sarah loves those hills.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.681
Okay, here's the microphone.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.724
Yeah, I see it.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.393
I-I mean, oh, thank you.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.437
Uh, i-is that Meg?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.439
Mom, what's going on with you?

12:52.522 --> 12:55.275
Nothing.
Especially my eyesight.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.902
I am still very, very blind.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.655
Thank you all for coming today.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.450
I can't see you, because I'm blind,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.118
but ICU.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.290
Please be sure to try out
our new colonic partnership

13:10.373 --> 13:12.792
with increasingly
irrelevant rapper Eminem,

13:12.876 --> 13:14.169
the Eminenema.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.505
It promises to clear out
"8 Miles" of mom's spaghetti.

13:17.589 --> 13:21.009
It goes in slim clear
and comes out slim shady.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.261
Thank you, I'm blind.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.438
That was incredible, Lois.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.273
You're a real inspiration.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.525
My name is Wanda Keptmymaidenname,

13:37.609 --> 13:39.319
and I work for Helen.

13:39.402 --> 13:43.740
Helen Disingenuous,
the beloved daytime talk show host

13:43.823 --> 13:45.784
who gives millions away to those in need

13:45.867 --> 13:47.619
and is still somehow loathed?

13:47.702 --> 13:51.706
Well, "loathed"
is a little bit exactly right, but yes.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.541
I'm here, Lois, because Helen has been

13:53.625 --> 13:56.461
following your success
and would love to make it her own.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.089
Would you consider
being a guest on our show?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.841
Oh, my gosh, really?
That's amazing.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.551
S-So I get to go to Hollywood?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.261
We actually tape the show in Burbank.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.972
- Oh. What's the difference?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.141
That's hilarious.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.352
I'll have someone
who makes a lot less money than me

14:12.435 --> 14:13.645
set everything up.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.605
Meg, can you believe it?

14:15.689 --> 14:18.316
This is gonna take ICU global.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.486
I'll be more popular
than a Robert Redford clip.

14:29.828 --> 14:33.289
Hey, guys.
My dad made you another list.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.001
"Teach Doug to ride a bike, bake cookies,

14:36.084 --> 14:37.711
listen to his Archer impression."

14:37.794 --> 14:39.546
This is ridiculous.
We're not doing any of this.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.173
I don't know, I kind of want
to hear his Archer impression.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.509
Yeah, I'm curious.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.263
I'm an international spy,
but I also do mundane things.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.682
Okay, all right.
That's-that's pretty good.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.100
But that's it.
No more.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.186
Then I guess my dad
will just have to sue you.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
You know what?
Go ahead and sue us.

14:57.063 --> 14:57.981
I mean, look at this guy.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.232
What do you think you're gonna get?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.359
We came here in his dog's car.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.153
But we had a deal.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.947
Well, the deal's off.
I'll call your dad myself.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.241
No, don't.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.951
- What the...?

15:14.122 --> 15:17.000
It was you making us do all that stuff.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.501
You made fools of us, Doug!

15:18.585 --> 15:19.586
Get him.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.631
Dad, help.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.343
I'm not Dad.
I'm Pete the Pirate.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.886
God, I already told you.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.346
Why did you do it?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.222
Why did you make us do all that stuff

15:31.306 --> 15:34.351
For this.
I did it for this.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.144
What?
What do you mean?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.940
I don't have a dog or a brother.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.234
Or even a father, really.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.197
But these past few days
I felt like I've had all that.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.783
I'm sorry, but I didn't know any other way

15:49.866 --> 15:51.826
to get you to spend time with me.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.329
Doug, there you are.
Thank God!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.797
Hey, I got your
message about the miscarriage.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.799
So, Saturday night?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.133
What a dick.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.469
You know what?
I'm gonna go poop in his shoes.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.471
You'd do that for me?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.765
Sure I will, buddy.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.685
Hang on, Brian.
I got one in the chamber.

16:16.768 --> 16:20.105
- I'll join you.
- Thanks, guys.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.731
I guess that just leaves us.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.401
Look, I think you're
a total garbage person.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.611
- Same.
- And being nice to you goes against

16:26.695 --> 16:28.655
- everything I stand for.
- Same.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.490
Okay, don't be the person
who just says "same,"

16:30.573 --> 16:31.950
like it's a real response.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.452
You know what,
let's just hate each other in public

16:34.536 --> 16:37.372
and maybe not hate each other
as much in private.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.124
Like George and Kellyanne Conway?

16:39.207 --> 16:41.459
What is up with those two?

16:44.546 --> 16:47.674
Ah, this is really gonna
put ICU over the top, Meg.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.384
I am gonna be rich.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.762
Now, which one is better,
the blue or the green?

16:52.846 --> 16:55.015
Wait, how do you
know what colors they are?

16:56.683 --> 17:00.061
Mom, you can see? I knew it.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.898
Okay, fine.
Yes, I can see.

17:03.982 --> 17:07.068
I can't believe you've been lying.
Why?

17:07.152 --> 17:09.070
Don't you get it?
I have to be blind

17:09.154 --> 17:10.572
to keep the money rolling in.

17:10.655 --> 17:14.117
Nobody's gonna be inspired
by a middle-aged, cisgendered,

17:14.200 --> 17:17.454
- able-bodied white woman.
- Or man.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.580
Now, you keep
your mouth shut, or I will...

17:18.663 --> 17:19.748
Knock knock.

17:19.831 --> 17:22.459
Helen, is that you?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.337
Oh, I'm so blind.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.467
I just wanted to say hello,
welcome you to the show.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.427
Have you been to Burbank before?

17:32.510 --> 17:35.347
- Never.
- Oh, well, while you're waiting,

17:35.430 --> 17:37.182
check out this video I made

17:37.265 --> 17:39.768
for the Burbank Tourism Association.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.437
<i>HELEN
Welcome to beautiful Burbank, California,</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:44.689
<i>home of more year-round Halloween stores</i>

17:44.773 --> 17:46.483
<i>than any other city in the world.</i>

<i>Want to see what you

18:03.375 --> 18:04.834
<i>in Honduras looks like?</i>

18:04.918 --> 18:07.087
<i>You can do all of that and so much more</i>

18:07.170 --> 18:09.130
<i>in Burbank.</i>

18:15.136 --> 18:18.848
We're here with Lois Griffin,
founder of ICU

18:18.932 --> 18:22.435
and an inspiration to millions
of easily persuadable women.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.064
So, Lois, I understand,
in addition to everything else,

18:26.147 --> 18:28.817
you've started the ICU Foundation.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.151
That's right, Helen.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.903
You know, you haven't really made it until

18:31.986 --> 18:33.530
you're able to convince rich people

18:33.613 --> 18:35.824
to give you money
for a nebulous and undefined

18:35.907 --> 18:37.450
important cause.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.203
And what will your foundation focus on?

18:40.286 --> 18:44.624
Women's issues.
And the environment.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.756
- Refugees.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.466
Well, we support you,

18:53.550 --> 18:55.677
so we've got a surprise for you.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.016
Oh, my God.
Reese Witherspoon?!

19:01.099 --> 19:02.434
I love her.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.814
Lois, how did you know
it was Reese Witherspoon

19:07.897 --> 19:09.315
- if you can't see?
- Ah.

19:09.399 --> 19:13.111
Um, that's-that's just, um, what I say

19:13.194 --> 19:16.239
when I'm excited.
Reese Witherspoon!

19:16.322 --> 19:18.450
Lois, are you actually blind?

19:18.533 --> 19:22.078
Yes.
I mean...

19:30.003 --> 19:32.297
No.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.758
I was blind when I started ICU,

19:34.841 --> 19:37.427
but I got my sight back a few days ago.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.555
I just wanted to make a difference
and, you know,

19:40.638 --> 19:43.850
maybe get money
from sympathetic strangers.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.602
I'm sorry.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.813
Hey, y'all, can I put
this big ole check down?

19:48.897 --> 19:50.565
My arms ain't but small sticks.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.027
Oh, shut up, Reese Witherspoon,
you big phony.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.779
There's no way you've read all those books

19:55.862 --> 19:57.614
you slap your sticker on.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.575
Well, Lois, you've disappointed
a lot of people here today.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.453
And since this is daytime TV,
you'll have to stand trial

20:03.536 --> 20:05.121
on a Black judge show.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.127
Lois Griffin, I find you guilty,

20:11.211 --> 20:13.630
and I sentence you
to pay your roommate back

20:13.713 --> 20:14.964
for his dog food,

20:15.048 --> 20:17.384
or whatever dumb this one's about.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.434
Well, Lois, I'm glad
you're not blind anymore.

20:26.518 --> 20:29.270
Oh, me, too.
I just wish I'd handled it better.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.022
Hey, at least you got to go to Hollywood.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.607
- Burbank.
- What's the difference?

20:32.691 --> 20:34.943
Oh, boy, I'll show you.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.238
