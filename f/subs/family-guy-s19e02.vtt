Rupert, remember
that very expensive bottle

00:39.414 --> 00:42.250
of coconut water I got
from Pressed Juicery in Newport

00:42.334 --> 00:44.085
that we were saving
for a special occasion?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.171
Well, I'm going to need you
to get two Dixie cups

00:46.254 --> 00:47.672
and open it!

00:47.756 --> 00:49.966
I got Busy Bee
for the second week in a row!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.969
Miss Debby said that I was
the best at sharing and helping.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.679
And she didn't even have to say that.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.973
She just had a cyst
removed from her ovary.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.392
You were right, Rupert.
I did exactly as you said.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.269
I just took it one day at a time

01:01.353 --> 01:03.313
and minded my own beeswax, and now look.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.607
Two weeks in a row.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.027
This is good for us.
This is very good for us.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.112
I know I wasn't originally supportive

01:11.196 --> 01:12.906
when you joined A.A., but I have to say,

01:12.989 --> 01:14.366
I've gotten something out of it, too.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.910
I mean, it works
when you work, so work it.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.787
Or, y-you know, h-however it goes.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.998
The point is,
together, we are unstoppable.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.500
I'm going for three weeks, Rupert.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.835
Nobody's ever gotten Busy Bee
three weeks in a row before,

01:25.919 --> 01:28.338
and with you by my side,
I know I can do it.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.882
You know, you look good.
I don't tell you that enough.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.010
I want to show you
how much I appreciate you.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.346
LOIS:
Stewie, are you up there?

01:36.429 --> 01:38.807
(laughs)
Her timing, am I right?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.433
-LOIS: Stewie?
-What?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.227
Oh, there you are, sweetie.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.937
You want some animal crackers?

01:44.020 --> 01:46.356
I just went to the market
and got a new crate.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.024
Ugh, can't you ever come back
from shopping

01:48.108 --> 01:49.734
without looking like
you were getting supplies

01:49.818 --> 01:51.152
for a refugee camp?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.071
They're downstairs if you want some.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.156
Get the hell out of here.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.617
You know what? I actually do
want some animal crackers, so...

01:57.701 --> 01:58.868
to be continued.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.662
The stuff is in the top drawer,

02:00.745 --> 02:03.331
so just, you know, get it ready.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.882
I'm going to do something
really nice for Rupert.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.677
Show him how much
he means to me, Annabelle.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.221
Oh, no, no. No, no,
I don't want you to kill anyone.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.848
-I'll let you know.
-There you are.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.099
What are you doing up here?

02:21.182 --> 02:23.560
Oh, hey, Bri.
I'm making a collage for Rupert.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.478
We've been firing on all cylinders lately,

02:25.562 --> 02:27.522
and I just wanted to let him know I care.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.606
That sounds stupid.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.983
Well, Annabelle doesn't think so.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.193
Right, Annabelle?

02:32.277 --> 02:35.030
PETER:
Holy (bleep), what is that?!

02:35.113 --> 02:36.990
Wow, look at all these old photos.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.950
Aw, I was such a cute puppy.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.368
That's not you. That's Snuffles.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.662
-He got hit by a car.
-Oh, word?

02:42.746 --> 02:44.080
You want to see something upsetting?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.874
Look at this photo of Chris.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.418
He's, like, three years old,
and he's in a mobility scooter

02:48.501 --> 02:50.253
rolling around an oxygen tank.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.214
Wait. Is that Rupert?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.633
-Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
-What's he doing with Chris?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.969
Well, Rupert belonged to Chris
before he was yours.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.555
-Didn't you know that?
-No, I did not know that.

03:00.638 --> 03:01.973
Yeah, he was named Skippy.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.725
He had a different name?!

03:03.808 --> 03:05.518
Yeah, Skippy.
Chris took him everywhere.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.645
-Used to sleep with him, too.
-You shut up!

03:07.729 --> 03:09.522
I think he was Peter's before that.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.149
Oh, God, this can't be happening.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.151
I thought Rupert was mine first,

03:13.234 --> 03:17.155
not some multigenerational family
dong koozie.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.247
We need to talk, Skippy.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.166
That's right, I know
all about you and Chris.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.377
Ah, ah, ah, don't.
Don't run out, don't run out.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.128
Look, just sit right there, please.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.672
I'm not angry, all right?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.715
I've j... I've had a lot of time to think,

03:35.799 --> 03:38.218
and, well, look, I-I don't see

03:38.301 --> 03:40.637
why this has to change anything
between us.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.681
We both have a past.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.933
(high-pitched):
Hello, I'm a lady comedienne.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.352
I want to get on stage
and talk about my husband

03:47.435 --> 03:49.562
and how he leaves
the toilet seat up, et cetera.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.147
Yeah, you don't seem like a lady.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.108
Maybe a boy or a baby or something.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.359
I don't know, but you're no lady.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.735
How dare you, sir!

03:55.819 --> 03:57.737
Must I show you my genitalia

03:57.821 --> 03:59.781
in order to book a gig
at this establishment?

03:59.864 --> 04:02.325
-Because I will.
-Go on. Beat it, weirdo.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.369
(regular voice):
Can I just stick around a little bit

04:04.452 --> 04:06.955
so I can go up onstage
when you guys win an Emmy?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.040
♪ ♪

04:13.503 --> 04:15.338
Uh, I guess I'll hold it.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.091
I had something memorized,
and it all dumped out.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.218
Uh, thank you to the Academy

04:20.301 --> 04:22.178
and to all the viewers who watch.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.685
Is the light keeping you up?

04:28.768 --> 04:31.688
FYI, I'm more in love with Michelle,

04:31.771 --> 04:33.231
if that was even possible.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.151
Oh. Oh, you know,
I still have that headache.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.361
Well, if you want to go over
to Chris's room...

04:38.445 --> 04:40.989
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.074
I said I wouldn't do that, and I did it.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.285
I'm just gonna finish this chapter.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.371
I'm trying, Rupert.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.040
I really am.
I want this to work.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.209
It's just that sometimes
I picture you in his bed, and...

04:53.293 --> 04:54.919
(breathes deeply)

04:55.003 --> 04:58.173
Anyway, big day tomorrow.
They're picking Busy Bee.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.258
I should get some sleep.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.846
(crying)

05:08.850 --> 05:10.352
I'm sorry.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.896
Nights are hard.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.943
Well...

05:20.570 --> 05:23.531
I didn't get it.
They gave Busy Bee to Frederick.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.533
Frederick!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.369
I'm not gonna hit you, so relax.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.953
Anyway, the point is

05:29.037 --> 05:31.039
it's not working anymore, Rupert.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.291
I can't focus.
I can't concentrate.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.293
Clearly, my work is suffering.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.546
Look, we're both adults.
We can split custody of Simon.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.548
I guess I'd better tell him.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.258
-Simon?
-(beeps)

05:42.342 --> 05:44.803
You know Mommy and Daddy
love you very much.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.054
(beeps twice)

05:46.137 --> 05:48.598
But Mommy and Daddy need some time apart.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.266
-(sustained low beep)
-Simon.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.269
Simon. Simon.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.274
Knock, knock.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.360
Stewie, can you see who's there?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.113
-What?
-Someone was knocking at the door.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.281
It-it was me.
I just went "knock, knock."

06:05.365 --> 06:06.574
There they are again.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.826
I don't even know how to process that,

06:07.909 --> 06:09.035
so I'm just gonna crack on.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.121
I have somebody here
that would like to see you.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.581
-Your teddy bear.
-You don't have to be coy.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.166
I know he was yours first.

06:15.250 --> 06:19.295
And, well, I want you to have...
Skippy back.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.132
-I know you're going to try
and stop me, but hear me...
-Okay.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.883
Oh. Great.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.677
Then I'll just leave him here.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.054
I hope you're both
very happy together, Chris.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.515
He belongs with you, not me.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.309
Well, I should get back to my book.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.937
That's a clock, but okay.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.901
This is just one night, got it?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.194
Now, I'm going to call you Rupert.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.279
You okay with that?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.281
And tomorrow, nothing happened.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.241
By the way, I have a Sleep Number bed.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.578
But don't worry,
I don't use it for sexual purposes.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.663
(motor whirring)

06:56.833 --> 06:58.001
What do you think of that?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.003
That something you can work with?

07:07.802 --> 07:10.805
(yawning)

07:10.889 --> 07:13.516
Well, looks like someone was up late.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.602
Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer

07:15.685 --> 07:18.480
when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.525
Oh, no!
They's doin' gay jokes without me.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.569
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.613
You're part of it now.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.328
God, you're sexy.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.081
What are you looking at?!
I told you that was one night!

07:36.164 --> 07:38.083
Now get out.
I called you an Uber.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.460
I'll know if you went further
than your house.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.630
-Hey, what are you doin'?
-Oh, hey, Bri.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.216
I was just putting some product
in my hair, you know.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.885
Yeah, this looks good.
Give it a little height.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.721
Let everyone know Stewie's
back on the market.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.223
I heard that on Friends.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.100
Did you know they're all 60 now?

07:55.183 --> 07:56.935
I knew Courteney Cox was.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.604
So, how you doing with Rupert
gone and everything?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.606
Are you kidding?
I'm fantastic!

08:01.690 --> 08:03.900
He was kind of holding me back,
if I'm being honest.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.404
It's time I got out there again.
I've had one bear my whole life.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.073
-That's not normal.
-Nothing about you is normal.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.076
I mean, I've already wasted
a whole year of my life with him.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.953
There's only been a year of your life.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.955
You know, all of your responses
have been very similar,

08:17.038 --> 08:18.623
so you might want to nip that in the bud.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.626
Look, the truth is,
things got a bit stale between us.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.753
There wasn't one part of Rupert's body

08:23.837 --> 08:25.630
that I didn't know by heart.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.298
None of it excites me anymore.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.926
Well, do you want me
to keep an eye on Rupert for you?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.219
Make sure he's doing okay?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.263
No need.
I turned him into a nanny cam.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.640
-A nanny cam?
-Yeah, I put it inside him.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.851
Deep.
It's inside him now.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.562
I-I don't know how to respond
that won't sound similar

08:40.645 --> 08:43.356
to other responses I've made,
so just, uh, continue.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.442
Right.
Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact,

08:45.525 --> 08:48.737
ten minutes later,
I'll get a chime notification on my phone,

08:48.820 --> 08:50.196
and I can pull up the video.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.406
Why is there a delay?

08:51.489 --> 08:52.657
Why can't you get the video immediately?

08:52.741 --> 08:54.617
I don't know.
Why can't you poop on a toilet?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.077
-Fair.
-(phone chimes)

08:56.161 --> 08:57.454
Ah, it's chiming, it's chiming.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.247
Okay, okay, calm down, just calm down.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.292
(breathes deeply)
Now, what do we have?

09:03.668 --> 09:07.589
Oops.
Sorry, Skippy.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.924
(gasps)
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.801
Is Chris wearing a nicotine patch?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.678
You know what, it's just like I said.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.765
He and Chris go together,
like peaches and cream.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.059
Peaches.
Peaches, I'm sorry.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.353
Damn it. You could've at least
given me some warning.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.063
At least a-a shoulder tap.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.773
I know, you're right.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.733
It's just that you're so beautiful,

20:07.832 --> 20:09.709
we've attributed to him.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.170
Because of the lake water,

20:12.253 --> 20:15.548
uh, I said some things
that I did not mean.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.677
Jordan Peele is our greatest
living filmmaker

20:18.760 --> 20:20.136
and visionary,

20:20.220 --> 20:22.722
both in comedy and in drama.

20:22.806 --> 20:25.433
There is nothing he can't do.

20:25.517 --> 20:30.230
(distorted): Good.
Now let's make some twin porn.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.482
Hit me again and you got a deal.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.992
Hey, sleepyhead.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.704
-Stewie.
-How ya feelin', pal?

20:45.787 --> 20:47.706
Uh... Okay.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.500
Do you remember what happened?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.044
-No.
-That's the right answer.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.587
Well, you have a lovely day

20:54.671 --> 20:56.297
and we'll see you when you get home.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.217
I think we can get a heart from this kid.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.927
Uhp, nope, he's up.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.004
