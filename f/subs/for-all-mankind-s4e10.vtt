WEBVTT

00:31.490 --> 00:32.741
<i>We get back to base camp,</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:35.786
<i>I still gotta write up
this geo field report for Site 42.</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
<i>You're gonna update the
techniques and methods sheet too, right?</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.750
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'll make sure to include it.</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:44.127
<i>File the report
once you get back to Happy Valley.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:45.838
<i>And cross-check the--</i>

00:47.089 --> 00:48.590
<i>Hey, do you see that over there?</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:49.842
<i>Where?</i>

00:49.842 --> 00:51.051
<i>Ten o'clock.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.302
<i>What is that?</i>

00:52.302 --> 00:54.721
<i>I don't know. I'm gonna go check it out.</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:21.266
PROTECT THE LEADER
AT ALL COSTS

05:25.742 --> 05:29.663
Taylor, I gotta go monitor
the ionizer cooldown sequence.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.165
Keep an eye out for anything unusual.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.459
Aye, aye, sir.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.008
Happy Valley, <i>Ranger-2</i>.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.510
Ion engine deactivation is complete.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.972
<i>All argon fuel injectors
have been rerouted to the plasma drive</i>

05:46.972 --> 05:48.140
<i>for the final burn</i>.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.601
<i>Copy,</i> Ranger-2.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.853
<i>Deactivation confirmed.</i>

05:53.812 --> 05:55.230
<i>Any issues with the changeover?</i>

05:55.731 --> 05:57.733
<i>Negative. All systems nominal.</i>

05:58.609 --> 05:59.610
Good.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.695
After we authenticate
the final command sequence

06:01.695 --> 06:03.197
for the slingshot from Houston,

06:03.197 --> 06:05.866
we will remotely initiate
the final Earth burn.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.826
<i>Copy that.</i> Ranger-2 <i>out.</i>

06:13.123 --> 06:15.626
<i>Commander Poole, I have
the final fuel consumption estimates...</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:07.427
Message from Dev.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.267
All right. They're checking
the final plasma drive start-up numbers.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.726
We gotta keep everything on track.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.020
Make sure to mirror
that last diagnostic upload to <i>Ranger</i>.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.605
Copy. Transmitting.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.149
Looks like <i>Ranger-2</i>'s on target.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.610
Two hours, four minutes till final burn.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.572
Good. All right. I'll be right back.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.746
How's he doing?

07:35.330 --> 07:37.249
I think I must take him to medical bay.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.002
No way. He saw our faces.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.129
When he wakes up in there,
we're gonna be fucked.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.797
If we keep him here, he could die.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.593
Yeah, I don't think we have a choice.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.303
Easy for you to say, Ed.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.431
You're not the one who's gonna go to jail
when he picks you out of a lineup.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.019
I take him.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.604
All right?

07:59.605 --> 08:00.981
Decision final.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.027
What are you gonna say to the doc?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.947
Accident with cargo loader.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.075
Okay. That's good.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.660
And when he wakes up?

08:15.787 --> 08:18.081
We have to cross that bridge
when we get to it.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.750
I'm sure Dima will help out.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.043
He has before.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.553
It will be fine.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.599
I hope so.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.112
We're running out of time, Dale.

08:49.112 --> 08:52.157
Tell us who else is involved
and you are free to go.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.159
Like I told you before,
I don't know anything.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.787
Just let me go.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.581
Please, you gotta stop this.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.461
What you doing?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.171
Increasing CO2 levels in room.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.677
You ever have
carbon dioxide poisoning before, Miles?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.973
Very quickly
it will become hard to breathe.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.183
Your heart rate will increase.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.354
Your head will feel like
it's gonna explode.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.064
And soon, you'll wish it had.

09:24.064 --> 09:24.982
Please don't do this.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.818
Give us the names of those involved,

09:27.818 --> 09:29.736
and we'll stop this right now.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.697
I told you, I don't know anything.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.806
You should start feeling
the effects of the CO2 quite soon.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.433
Please don't do this.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.775
Who were you working with?

10:10.903 --> 10:13.989
Tell us what you know and we'll stop this.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.992
I don't know anything. I swear.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.599
Where are they?

10:40.599 --> 10:45.687
Please. I'm gonna be sick.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.940
Just tell us where they are.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.531
You got some on my shoe!

11:01.078 --> 11:03.121
Please.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.748
I don't know anything. Please.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.501
This isn't working,
and we're running out of time.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.878
We gotta try something else.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.631
Please. Please let me go.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.469
Please, man. I just wanna see my family.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.805
Just let me see my family.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.565
Please.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.510
Miss Madison?

12:11.648 --> 12:12.774
Come in.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.652
Good morning.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.197
Yes?

12:18.197 --> 12:19.364
Sorry.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.075
Eli was wondering
if you'd be able to come to his office.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.289
- Can't it wait?
- He says it's important.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.011
I'm feeling pretty confident

12:41.011 --> 12:43.889
that the security on Happy Valley
has it in hand,

12:43.889 --> 12:47.935
as your people well know,
because my people detected them attempt--

12:49.102 --> 12:51.438
Margo, thank you for coming by.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.443
Hello, Margo.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.076
Director Morozova.

13:04.660 --> 13:05.786
I...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.622
I wish I'd known you were coming.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.290
I would have prepared.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.043
No preparations are necessary.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.671
A nice surprise, isn't it?

13:15.671 --> 13:16.797
Yes.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.924
Yes, it is.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.594
Feels like she and I talk
pretty much every day lately

13:22.594 --> 13:24.054
over this damn thing.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.558
But I haven't seen Irina in person
since Leningrad.

13:27.558 --> 13:30.936
We had the best dinner at that place.

13:30.936 --> 13:34.022
They served that little fried fish
with the mashed potatoes--

13:34.022 --> 13:35.566
- Koryushka.
- Koryushka.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.527
Honestly, I haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

13:38.527 --> 13:42.447
Well, I've come to observe
the culmination of our efforts

13:42.447 --> 13:44.283
to bring the asteroid to Earth.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.451
It's gonna be
a special moment for all of us.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.621
Eli tells me you have
settled right back in.

13:49.621 --> 13:53.292
Kinda hard to settle in
when you're followed everywhere you go.

13:53.292 --> 13:54.918
I can imagine.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.796
Well, you don't have to
endure it much longer.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.925
After asteroid has been put on
a correct trajectory for Earth,

14:01.925 --> 14:05.179
you and I are returning to Star City.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.223
Wonderful.

14:34.958 --> 14:35.792
Great.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.712
We need to make sure we don't miss
any contributors to comm latency.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.173
We've run 50 end-to-end tests.
Results match predictions.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.300
Make sure
we get those test reports back ASAP.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.344
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
What's going on?

14:57.231 --> 14:59.566
Irina Morozova is here.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.110
In Houston?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.322
She was supposed to be in Moscow
with Korzhenko when the burn happens.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.533
You know, maybe it's about
this sabotage rumor.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.036
Whatever it is, we need to get
word to our mutual acquaintance.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.246
Have you been in touch with him?

15:13.038 --> 15:15.499
I sent him the latest
kinetic impact calculations this morning,

15:15.499 --> 15:16.875
but I haven't heard back.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.252
He's not answering his phone.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.546
You may need to go to him in person.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.714
We're less than two hours away to burn.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.132
- I can't--
- Aleida, please.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.717
I'll cover for you while you're gone.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.846
I'd go myself,
but I've got a lot of eyes on me.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.098
Okay.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.561
Tell him he needs to leave Houston.
It's not safe for him here anymore.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.522
He's not gonna listen.

15:38.522 --> 15:39.523
Make him.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.318
Please.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.378
Commander.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.842
Any update on Miles Dale?

16:06.842 --> 16:08.051
He's not talking yet.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.387
But I think
we should be making progress soon.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.181
Keep questioning him.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.433
My gut says
that he's involved in this somehow.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.436
And any news about
the missing equipment downstairs?

16:17.436 --> 16:21.023
No, ma'am. Just a lot of people pissed off
at being searched repeatedly.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.110
I want everyone
who doesn't have a mission-essential job

16:25.110 --> 16:27.070
to be confined to their quarters
until this is all over.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.822
And continue the sweep of the base.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.991
If someone really is planning
something against <i>Ranger</i>,

16:30.991 --> 16:32.784
we need to figure it out fast.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.911
Yes, ma'am.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.751
Team two, start mods at nine through 15.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.462
Team three, mods 16 through 22.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.424
Team one, you're with me.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.342
What's going on?

16:48.342 --> 16:50.093
You all need to return
to your quarters immediately.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.137
- Why?
- Orders of base commander.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.055
Mandatory curfew.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.265
All non-essential personnel
are restricted to quarters.

16:55.849 --> 16:56.850
Bullshit.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.894
Take him.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.979
- Let's go.
- Get your hands off of me.

17:14.952 --> 17:18.664
<i>Return to your quarters
immediately if you are not...</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:23.877
<i>Non-essential workers are to stay
in lockdown for the next 36 hours.</i>

17:25.753 --> 17:27.548
<i>Return to your quarters immediately.</i>

17:27.548 --> 17:30.801
<i>I repeat, non-essential workers,
stay in your rooms.</i>

18:13.051 --> 18:14.428
Check-in's at 4:00.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.762
I'm-- I'm not here for a room.

18:15.762 --> 18:21.226
Do you know which room
Sergei Bezukhov is in?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.520
That was so sad.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.690
What was sad?

18:26.690 --> 18:30.194
Wha-- He stayed here for a few weeks.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.821
I figured he was here
for some sort of business thing.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.324
Yeah, we do get businessmen
every once in a while.

18:36.533 --> 18:40.621
He was from Yugoslavia, I think,
or maybe it was Sweden.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.833
And yesterday he just...
...ups and shoots himself.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.089
He shot himself?

18:51.882 --> 18:53.217
It's such a shame.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.055
He was just a--
Seemed like a real sweet guy.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.848
Always had a smile.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.667
Water?

20:18.886 --> 20:21.680
You were just down here
hiding among us this whole time?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
We all have things to hide, no?

20:26.476 --> 20:27.686
Mr. Black Market.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.246
My friend was very helpful.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.586
Hey, buddy.

20:53.504 --> 20:54.796
How you holding up?

20:59.676 --> 21:01.887
Please, man, you gotta believe me.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.931
I don't know what it is you want to know.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.559
God, I want to believe you.

21:08.227 --> 21:09.436
I really do.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.064
That you're just an upstanding individual

21:12.064 --> 21:14.900
caught in the middle
of an unfortunate situation.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.165
Amanda?

21:30.165 --> 21:31.500
Yeah.

21:33.752 --> 21:34.837
What is this?

21:36.922 --> 21:40.551
We know all about
your little import-export business.

21:41.385 --> 21:45.222
Which makes your lovely little wife
an accessory.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.394
Accessory?

21:50.936 --> 21:52.813
She's looking at five years.

21:54.231 --> 21:56.149
Felony, theft, and distribution.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.111
- Son of a bitch.
- And your kids.

21:59.111 --> 22:00.487
Hey, you stay away from my kids.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.739
No, don't worry about them.
They'll be fine.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.617
Child Protective Services
will take good care of them--

22:05.617 --> 22:07.953
Hey, you--
Hey, come here, you motherfucker!

22:07.953 --> 22:09.913
Hey! Fuck! Fuck!

22:11.832 --> 22:13.208
No, please, man.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.460
Please, man, not my family.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.879
Please don't do that.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.464
Don't do that.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.425
No, please, please.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.218
Please, not my family. Please.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.637
I didn't do this to your family, Miles.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.182
You did.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.726
No, no, no.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.353
You want your family safe.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.314
So do we.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.065
Help me out here.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.609
Fuck me.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.068
I can't. I just--

22:42.613 --> 22:45.866
You tell us what we need to know,
we'll keep them safe.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.668
You'll all be safe.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.378
If you help me out.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.601
Okay.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.978
Okay.

23:17.898 --> 23:18.899
They're--

23:22.694 --> 23:24.363
They're on sub-level four.

23:24.363 --> 23:27.282
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.245
Motherfucker.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.582
Fuck.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.883
<i>Auto-sequences are now executing step 785.</i>

23:44.883 --> 23:46.885
<i>Happy Valley to</i> Ranger.

23:50.681 --> 23:53.475
When we get down there
I want every inch searched.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.524
Missions check.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.693
No, don't worry about it now.
Pick it up and go.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.486
Wait until Scott's out of here...

24:06.071 --> 24:08.115
How did they even access sub-level four?

24:08.115 --> 24:09.825
I thought we sealed off the lower floors.

24:09.825 --> 24:12.119
Someone circumvented the lockout.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.038
Let's go.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.332
Get extra rounds.
We're not coming back here.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.417
All right, let's move.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.669
All right... make sure you got comms.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.296
You good?

24:35.601 --> 24:36.602
It's Mayday, sir.

24:39.438 --> 24:40.898
Jesus, they're coming.

25:26.777 --> 25:27.945
Spread out.

25:30.239 --> 25:31.240
Yes, sir.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.414
It's another Ops-Com.

25:40.541 --> 25:43.168
They built another fucking Ops-Com.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.720
My God.

25:56.974 --> 25:58.141
<i>Is that even possible?</i>

25:58.141 --> 26:01.103
In terms of physics,
can someone steal an asteroid?

26:01.979 --> 26:03.313
Technically? Yes.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.440
If they had been able to take control

26:05.440 --> 26:08.193
of <i>Ranger</i>'s
flight computer and lengthen burn,

26:08.193 --> 26:09.695
they could have slowed down the asteroid

26:09.695 --> 26:12.573
long enough
to change its trajectory into Mars' orbit.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.449
Don't they know
what we're trying to do here?

26:15.325 --> 26:16.952
We're trying to change the world!

26:17.786 --> 26:19.955
And they're trying to
line their goddamn pockets.

26:19.955 --> 26:22.165
Look, Eli, there is good news here.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.251
We've regained control
of <i>Ranger</i>'s discriminator

26:24.251 --> 26:26.170
and we're back on track for Earth burn.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.963
Good.

26:28.547 --> 26:31.425
Will, take charge of this. Please.

26:31.425 --> 26:34.178
Do whatever you need to do
to make sure this asteroid comes home.

26:34.887 --> 26:36.263
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.604
I got one of them!

26:48.984 --> 26:51.028
Where are the rest of you?

26:56.408 --> 26:57.618
Fuck!

26:57.618 --> 26:59.953
Answer the question.

27:00.996 --> 27:01.872
Bishop, that's enough.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.457
Where are they?

27:03.457 --> 27:05.667
That's enough!

27:05.667 --> 27:07.503
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:15.719 --> 27:18.180
What are these foreigners doing in here?

27:18.180 --> 27:20.349
This is against protocols and--

27:20.349 --> 27:21.600
Quiet!

27:23.143 --> 27:26.188
While Commander Cho is ill,
I am in command!

27:26.980 --> 27:28.732
Return to your stations!

27:34.321 --> 27:35.531
Yes, sir.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.292
It's over, isn't it?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.586
- It appears that way.
- Shit.

27:55.259 --> 27:57.219
Ranger-2 <i>telemetry reading nominal.</i>

27:57.219 --> 27:59.721
The revised trajectory calcs
are coming in from Ames.

27:59.721 --> 28:03.684
Good. Now that we've regained
control of <i>Ranger</i>'s discriminator,

28:03.684 --> 28:05.561
we need to uplink that data ASAP.

28:05.561 --> 28:08.063
Gonna take at least four minutes
to get to them.

28:08.063 --> 28:11.984
Okay, so in order for 2003LC
to be at the proper speed

28:11.984 --> 28:14.653
when it reaches Mars
for the slingshot maneuver to Earth...

28:14.653 --> 28:19.199
<i>Ranger</i> will need to burn its engines for...

28:22.327 --> 28:25.289
20 minutes, 14.271 seconds.

28:25.289 --> 28:26.290
Copy that.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.542
Commence uplink to <i>Ranger-2.</i>

28:29.042 --> 28:30.586
Commencing uplink to <i>Ranger-2</i>.

28:51.023 --> 28:54.526
Once the signal is
transmitted from Happy Valley to <i>Ranger</i>,

28:54.526 --> 28:57.321
and authenticated
via our discriminator box,

28:57.321 --> 28:58.614
we have to keep an eye on...

28:58.614 --> 28:59.740
...the rate of argon.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.325
Keeping it low.

29:01.325 --> 29:02.534
Excuse me.

29:07.664 --> 29:08.707
Did you get hold of him?

29:09.875 --> 29:11.251
We should go to your office.

29:12.961 --> 29:13.795
Aleida.

29:14.713 --> 29:18.383
Can we please just go to your office?

29:23.847 --> 29:25.390
All right. Let's go.

29:36.777 --> 29:40.030
What is it?
We can't be away from MOCR for too long.

29:54.086 --> 29:55.128
What?

30:08.350 --> 30:09.560
That's enough.

30:45.554 --> 30:47.306
...the North Korean delegation.

30:47.306 --> 30:49.725
We really need to talk about
what percentage.

30:49.725 --> 30:51.768
- We should truly--
- What did you do?

30:52.853 --> 30:53.812
Margo.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.648
What did you do?

30:59.776 --> 31:00.652
Whatever you think

31:00.652 --> 31:02.529
- has happened, I would ad--
- Don't fucking handle me.

31:03.238 --> 31:04.489
Not now.

31:05.115 --> 31:07.284
- Please calm yourself.
- Irina, what's going on here?

31:07.784 --> 31:10.329
I think you are under a lot of stress.

31:10.329 --> 31:12.539
And I think you should control yourself.

31:12.539 --> 31:14.249
So why don't you go sit down?

31:15.959 --> 31:17.252
You knew him.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.088
You worked with him for years.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.134
How could you?

31:26.887 --> 31:28.222
How could I what?

31:30.849 --> 31:32.851
Margo, why don't you come sit down?

31:32.851 --> 31:34.144
We can talk about this.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.270
But that's not--

31:56.375 --> 31:57.668
Excuse me.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.603
Really? You can't hold me like this.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.688
What the fuck?

32:18.480 --> 32:19.565
Miles?

32:22.109 --> 32:23.819
Shit, bro.

32:24.695 --> 32:25.946
You okay?

32:27.072 --> 32:28.991
What did you do to him,
you fucking animals?

32:29.825 --> 32:30.909
Man.

32:34.580 --> 32:35.664
Fuck.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.501
Everybody okay?

32:40.419 --> 32:41.753
No, man.

32:42.462 --> 32:44.173
They found ghost ops.

32:45.424 --> 32:48.177
Everybody just ran.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.681
It's over.

32:55.184 --> 32:56.435
Everything we did.

32:56.435 --> 32:58.812
It was all for nothing.

33:00.981 --> 33:02.316
Fucking hell.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.384
Ranger, <i>Happy Valley.</i>

33:29.384 --> 33:31.970
<i>Final engine burn
duration command transmitting.</i>

33:32.513 --> 33:34.765
<i>Confirm acquisition and authentication.</i>

33:35.807 --> 33:37.059
Copy, Happy Valley.

33:37.059 --> 33:38.936
Stand by for confirmation.

33:39.895 --> 33:42.231
Taylor, verify discriminator active.

33:43.148 --> 33:45.025
Discriminator shows active.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.693
Affirmative, Happy Valley.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.487
Command has been authenticated.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.866
<i>Commencing final engine burn checklist.</i>

33:52.866 --> 33:54.743
<i>All systems nominal.</i>

33:54.743 --> 33:57.496
Commander Poole.
<i>Ranger</i> is approaching the burn window.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.498
Copy.

33:59.498 --> 34:00.666
<i>Ranger,</i> Happy Valley.

34:00.666 --> 34:03.293
You are go
for your slingshot burn to Earth.

34:03.293 --> 34:04.253
<i>Copy.</i>

34:04.253 --> 34:07.089
Executing final <i>Ranger-2</i> Earth burn

34:07.089 --> 34:08.841
in three,

34:09.466 --> 34:10.717
two,

34:10.717 --> 34:11.927
one.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.945
<i>Happy Valley?</i> Ranger-2<i>.</i>

34:31.029 --> 34:32.572
<i>All systems nominal.</i>

34:32.572 --> 34:33.739
<i>We have good burn.</i>

34:34.741 --> 34:36.326
We're burning for Earth, people.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.333
Congratulations.

34:54.052 --> 34:56.429
Maybe we could just
overload the discriminator

34:56.429 --> 34:57.890
by sending multiple commands.

34:57.890 --> 34:58.891
Won't work.

34:58.891 --> 35:01.143
We don't know
the box's new encryption key.

35:01.810 --> 35:03.770
The computer's back in control
of the entire ship.

35:04.813 --> 35:07.441
Without ghost ops,
our hands are tied down here.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.538
Is that a high-gain S-band transmitter?

35:26.210 --> 35:27.628
What are you thinking?

35:27.628 --> 35:31.298
Well, doesn't the M-7 charter
require that any North Korean ujunaut

35:31.298 --> 35:35.552
on a joint mission be able to communicate
privately with their superior officers?

35:35.552 --> 35:36.970
Yes.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.805
For security.

35:39.473 --> 35:42.267
No foreign entity can hear.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.811
Which means we could talk to Massey
on a private channel.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.271
Exactly.

35:46.271 --> 35:47.606
She's the key.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.274
Wait a minute. How-How would that work?

35:49.274 --> 35:52.277
I mean, you just said we don't have
control of the discriminator anymore.

35:52.277 --> 35:53.987
Doesn't matter. We go around it.

35:54.696 --> 35:58.033
If Massey can manually disconnect
the flight deck from the engines,

35:58.033 --> 36:00.494
they won't be able to stop their own burn.

36:00.494 --> 36:02.371
They'd be completely cut off.

36:02.371 --> 36:05.749
You see, they installed
a local command override switch

36:05.749 --> 36:08.460
on <i>Ranger</i> when they were attaching
the new plasma engines.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.755
If she can engage the override
and plug in a transceiver

36:11.755 --> 36:13.549
tuned to our frequency right here,

36:13.549 --> 36:15.843
the only person in control of the burn...

36:17.845 --> 36:18.846
would be me.

36:21.682 --> 36:23.225
We might be back in business, people.

36:23.225 --> 36:26.478
Hold on. But the override
switch is outside the ship.

36:27.312 --> 36:29.439
Sam would have to do an EVA
during the burn.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.524
That's insane.

36:30.524 --> 36:33.068
No, it-it's dangerous,
but it's not impossible.

36:33.068 --> 36:36.697
As long as we can figure out a way
to use the S-band to communicate with her.

36:36.697 --> 36:37.781
Guide her through it.

36:37.781 --> 36:41.702
I can contact Park Chui Moo.

36:41.702 --> 36:43.954
Science officer on mission.

36:45.497 --> 36:48.834
He can give Massey Korean radio.

36:49.960 --> 36:53.213
Do you trust him?

36:56.091 --> 36:58.719
I see good chamber
pressures in all plasma engines.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.596
Fluctuation is well within limits.

37:04.224 --> 37:05.934
Keep checking those pressures.

37:05.934 --> 37:07.311
How's the trajectory?

37:23.243 --> 37:24.870
Massey.

37:28.081 --> 37:29.082
Take.

37:36.256 --> 37:37.716
Yeah?

37:37.716 --> 37:39.176
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

37:41.261 --> 37:42.221
Dev?

37:43.096 --> 37:45.599
<i>We need you to go
to the rear cargo bay of</i> Ranger<i>.</i>

37:46.642 --> 37:48.852
<i>We just might have another way
to keep the engines firing,</i>

37:48.852 --> 37:53.315
<i>but it's-- Well, it is-- It's complicated.</i>

37:53.815 --> 37:55.400
Ranger<i>, Happy Valley.</i>

37:55.400 --> 37:56.735
<i>Trajectory looks nominal.</i>

37:56.735 --> 37:58.987
<i>Deceleration rate as predicted.</i>

38:04.993 --> 38:08.247
Commander, I have alert
that cargo bay air lock hatch is open.

38:10.082 --> 38:12.918
Cargo bay? Must be a bad sensor.

38:12.918 --> 38:15.420
Ranger<i>, Happy Valley.</i>

38:15.420 --> 38:18.715
<i>We're also getting a read on
your cargo bay air lock hatch alert.</i>

38:20.217 --> 38:21.552
Bring up camera 37.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.433
Switch to 38.

38:31.562 --> 38:32.813
Jesus.

38:32.813 --> 38:35.232
Is that a North Korean suit?

38:36.316 --> 38:37.901
Where's Massey?

38:42.489 --> 38:44.324
<i>Now keep your breathing steady.</i>

38:44.324 --> 38:46.577
<i>Don't wanna burn too much oxygen.</i>

38:46.577 --> 38:50.330
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

38:50.330 --> 38:53.417
<i>Now what's your distance from
the override switch access panel?</i>

38:54.459 --> 38:56.378
<i>Six meters and-and closing.</i>

38:56.879 --> 38:59.798
<i>Acceleration from the engine burn
is-is stronger than I thought.</i>

38:59.798 --> 39:01.466
<i>It's trying to pull me off</i> Ranger.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.385
<i>Okay. Be careful.</i>

39:03.927 --> 39:07.389
<i>Now we got about 17 minutes left
until they try to shut off their engines.</i>

39:07.389 --> 39:10.809
<i>It's essential that the override switch
is engaged at that point.</i>

39:10.809 --> 39:13.478
<i>It won't allow them
to stop their own burn.</i>

39:15.522 --> 39:16.523
<i>Copy.</i>

39:17.316 --> 39:18.692
<i>Tether attached.</i>

39:21.486 --> 39:23.822
<i>Translating to the access panel now.</i>

39:26.700 --> 39:27.701
<i>Okay.</i>

39:28.660 --> 39:30.829
<i>And I'm at the override access panel.</i>

39:31.747 --> 39:33.916
All right. Just keep it frosty up there.

39:34.625 --> 39:38.795
<i>Copy. Removing panel.</i>

39:38.795 --> 39:41.465
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

39:43.842 --> 39:45.844
<i>Fuck.</i>

39:45.844 --> 39:49.556
<i>Now under that panel, you'll see
a handle with yellow and black markings.</i>

39:49.556 --> 39:50.974
<i>That's the override switch.</i>

39:51.558 --> 39:54.645
<i>To engage it, you gotta pull it out
to the override position.</i>

39:54.645 --> 39:58.398
<i>Okay. And I can--
I can see an override handle.</i>

39:58.899 --> 40:00.567
<i>I'm gonna pull it out now.</i>

40:00.567 --> 40:04.196
<i>After it's engaged, you just
have to put the transceiver Park gave you</i>

40:04.196 --> 40:07.783
<i>into the RF input and I can control
the engine from down here.</i>

40:11.954 --> 40:13.288
<i>One more time.</i>

40:22.756 --> 40:24.716
<i>Shit.</i>

40:24.716 --> 40:26.844
<i>The override handle won't stay out.</i>

40:27.427 --> 40:29.721
Damn it. Must be spring-loaded to auto.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.683
See if you can secure it with something.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.686
<i>I don't have
a lot of options up here, guys.</i>

40:39.106 --> 40:40.482
Your tether.

40:40.482 --> 40:41.692
<i>My tether.</i>

40:41.692 --> 40:44.194
<i>Okay.
Then I-- then I wouldn't have a tether.</i>

40:45.153 --> 40:47.114
<i>You said you wanted
to be an astronaut, didn't you?</i>

41:05.716 --> 41:08.093
She's at the override switch access panel.

41:08.844 --> 41:12.806
Jesus. She's trying to disconnect us
from the plasma engines.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.516
<i>Why would she do that?</i>

41:15.267 --> 41:16.810
<i>Happy Valley.</i> Ranger<i>.</i>

41:16.810 --> 41:20.439
<i>They are attempting to engage the safety
override so we can't control our engines.</i>

41:22.065 --> 41:24.193
If those engines burn,
even for a few seconds longer

41:24.193 --> 41:27.821
past our 20-minute window,
the asteroid won't turn for Earth.

41:28.739 --> 41:30.365
<i>Palmer, get suited up.</i>

41:30.365 --> 41:32.284
<i>I need you to put a stop to this.</i>

41:35.120 --> 41:36.955
<i>Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.</i>

41:47.216 --> 41:48.592
A moment, Commander?

41:58.018 --> 41:59.728
Any sign of their crew?

41:59.728 --> 42:02.022
Turns out Commander Cho
has been unconscious

42:02.022 --> 42:04.191
in the med bay since this morning.

42:04.191 --> 42:07.694
We think the crew may be holed up
in the North Korean module.

42:07.694 --> 42:09.613
- Have you notified Houston?
- Yeah.

42:09.613 --> 42:11.114
Still waiting on approval.

42:11.698 --> 42:14.201
- Approval for what?
- To go in.

42:30.467 --> 42:31.468
Raise North Korean module.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.053
Yes, Commander.

42:39.434 --> 42:41.478
<i>This is Commander Danielle Poole.</i>

42:41.478 --> 42:43.105
<i>Come in.</i>

42:48.110 --> 42:52.072
- Lee Jung-Gil. Over.
<i>- Lee? Let me talk to Ed.</i>

42:52.990 --> 42:54.199
<i>I know he's in there with you.</i>

42:56.326 --> 42:59.997
- He j-- not here.
- <i>Don't start with me.</i>

42:59.997 --> 43:01.874
<i>Not after all we've been through.</i>

43:06.170 --> 43:07.212
Hi, Bob.

43:07.212 --> 43:08.839
What the hell are you doing?

43:08.839 --> 43:10.132
<i>Well, Dani...</i>

43:10.132 --> 43:13.552
- Ed, this is crazy. You gotta stop this.
- Why?

43:13.552 --> 43:17.014
So you can haul this thing back to Earth
and let Mars wither up and die?

43:17.639 --> 43:19.892
- No, thank you.
- <i>This ain't about Mars.</i>

43:19.892 --> 43:22.477
<i>This is about changing things
for the better on Earth.</i>

43:22.477 --> 43:24.146
<i>Mars is not our home, Ed.</i>

43:24.146 --> 43:25.898
That's where you're wrong, Dani.

43:26.607 --> 43:27.983
My family's here.

43:29.151 --> 43:30.736
My future's here.

43:35.199 --> 43:37.117
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.621
You're still tied
to that blue little planet.

43:40.621 --> 43:43.290
<i>Of course, I am. We all are.</i>

43:43.290 --> 43:45.792
<i>That is what matters. That is our home.</i>

43:47.044 --> 43:48.545
Not anymore.

44:19.535 --> 44:22.412
Words have no wings
but they can fly a thousand miles.

44:25.290 --> 44:27.251
This is my home.

44:29.378 --> 44:30.963
Mine too.

44:34.758 --> 44:36.552
<i>If those engines burn,</i>

44:36.552 --> 44:39.304
<i>even for a few seconds longer
past our 20-minute window,</i>

44:39.304 --> 44:41.265
<i>the asteroid won't turn for Earth.</i>

44:41.265 --> 44:42.599
<i>Palmer, get suited up.</i>

44:42.599 --> 44:44.184
<i>I need you to put a stop to this.</i>

44:44.184 --> 44:46.520
They're trying to lock us out
of our own ship?

44:46.520 --> 44:49.898
Well, technically they're engaging
a diagnostic and checkout engine protocol,

44:49.898 --> 44:51.817
but-- Yeah. Same idea.

44:51.817 --> 44:54.361
I don't care what we have to do.
We must stop them.

44:54.361 --> 44:57.239
If they override the flight computer,
there is nothing <i>Ranger</i> can do.

45:00.367 --> 45:02.077
They go around us. We go around them.

45:03.787 --> 45:05.080
What do you mean?

45:05.080 --> 45:09.459
We upload a shutdown command that
bypasses the safeguards

45:09.459 --> 45:13.547
of the nuclear fusion reactor controls
and turn off the engines.

45:13.547 --> 45:14.882
Right at the end of the Earth burn.

45:14.882 --> 45:16.133
I don't understand.

45:16.133 --> 45:18.510
They can't burn to Mars
if they don't have the gas.

45:18.510 --> 45:21.013
<i>Ranger</i>'s flight deck doesn't
have authorization to execute that,

45:21.013 --> 45:22.306
but we can do it from here.

45:22.306 --> 45:23.682
And if we send up code

45:23.682 --> 45:26.643
that commands <i>Ranger</i>'s reactors
to stop powering the engines,

45:26.643 --> 45:28.061
they'll be forced to shut down.

45:28.061 --> 45:30.189
With the communication lag,

45:30.189 --> 45:32.941
any command we send
would take five minutes to get to <i>Ranger</i>.

45:33.442 --> 45:34.860
Then we should get started.

45:37.237 --> 45:38.447
All right.

45:39.072 --> 45:40.407
This has to work. I mean...

46:05.182 --> 46:06.391
Margo?

46:15.442 --> 46:17.236
Wernher and I used to sit up here.

46:18.237 --> 46:20.280
We'd have lunch every few days.

46:21.448 --> 46:23.033
He'd tell me what I was doing right.

46:24.201 --> 46:26.495
He'd tell me what I was doing wrong.

46:27.329 --> 46:28.956
Try to give me advice.

46:30.374 --> 46:32.584
Usually just listen to me complain.

46:36.255 --> 46:37.798
I was standing right there.

46:40.133 --> 46:41.343
Where you are now.

46:42.052 --> 46:45.222
After everything came out
about what he did during the war.

46:48.225 --> 46:49.852
I asked him if he knew.

46:51.436 --> 46:52.771
About the camps.

46:53.355 --> 46:54.690
The deaths.

46:55.482 --> 46:57.401
I'll never forget what he said.

46:59.361 --> 47:01.321
"Progress is never free.

47:02.823 --> 47:06.159
There is always a cost."

47:09.872 --> 47:11.164
You're not him.

47:12.583 --> 47:13.584
No.

47:15.502 --> 47:17.504
But maybe a part of me is.

47:24.803 --> 47:27.139
Margo, we really need your help in there.

47:28.891 --> 47:31.143
This is not a place for feelings.

47:33.395 --> 47:35.063
Just the facts.

47:38.400 --> 47:43.322
Wernher made it seem like...
he had no choice.

47:44.948 --> 47:47.242
But there is always a choice.

47:48.410 --> 47:49.661
Just like you said.

47:55.167 --> 47:59.004
That asteroid comes to Earth,
then the Mars program is dead.

47:59.963 --> 48:01.673
Just like Sergei said.

48:01.673 --> 48:04.676
Maybe not this year, but soon.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.600
People up there,
they don't care about Mars.

48:12.434 --> 48:14.937
- They just care about themselves.
- Maybe.

48:16.563 --> 48:22.027
But if they succeed, then NASA, Roscosmos,
and the M-7 have no choice

48:22.027 --> 48:25.656
but to continue investing in Happy Valley

48:27.449 --> 48:29.535
and the future of the space program.

48:31.161 --> 48:34.414
We can't let them throw away
everything we've built.

48:42.339 --> 48:44.174
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

48:46.343 --> 48:48.262
"Progress is never free."

49:07.239 --> 49:08.282
<i>Sam, what's your status?</i>

49:08.282 --> 49:11.785
<i>Okay. I'm finishing securing the tether.</i>

49:16.415 --> 49:17.249
<i>Okay.</i>

49:19.418 --> 49:23.172
<i>Override handle has been secured
in the up position.</i>

49:23.172 --> 49:25.757
Okay, now there should be
an electrical connector labeled

49:25.757 --> 49:29.553
<i>J-13 EXT RF to the port side
of the override switch.</i>

49:29.553 --> 49:32.848
<i>That's where you can connect the P13
connector coming off your transceiver.</i>

49:32.848 --> 49:34.808
<i>- Do you see that, Sam?
- Copy.</i>

49:41.315 --> 49:45.027
<i>Okay. You should be able to receive
engine telemetry now.</i>

49:45.027 --> 49:46.069
Signal confirmed.

49:46.778 --> 49:49.281
As soon as I input the timing
for the <i>Mars burn</i>, you have to keep

49:49.281 --> 49:51.992
<i>the override switch handle
in the up position</i>

49:51.992 --> 49:54.411
<i>for the entire duration of the burn.</i>

49:54.411 --> 49:55.913
<i>Copy that.</i>

50:14.306 --> 50:17.893
If we were able to insert this code
directly into what MOCR's uplinking,

50:17.893 --> 50:20.479
it might be able to prevent
their shutdown command

50:20.479 --> 50:22.731
from stopping the Mars orbit capture burn.

50:23.774 --> 50:27.194
But how are we going to modify it
if they're still writing it?

50:27.903 --> 50:29.655
I'll input it right before uplink.

50:35.869 --> 50:36.787
Let's do it.

50:43.836 --> 50:45.003
But I'm gonna input the code.

50:46.213 --> 50:51.802
- Aleida. No. Absolutely not.
- There are too many eyes on you.

50:54.012 --> 50:55.222
It has to be me.

50:56.265 --> 50:57.766
Or it will never work.

51:05.732 --> 51:08.402
<i>Override is still engaged. Holding steady.</i>

51:10.571 --> 51:13.574
<i>Okay. Don't let the unit
touch the hull plate.</i>

51:13.574 --> 51:15.868
<i>An ion charge could fry the circuits.</i>

51:15.868 --> 51:16.952
<i>Copy.</i>

51:32.968 --> 51:34.011
Sam, are you there?

51:35.345 --> 51:36.346
Come in, Sam.

51:36.889 --> 51:38.432
<i>I've got company.</i>

51:39.516 --> 51:40.767
<i>It's Palmer.</i>

51:49.902 --> 51:51.945
The reactor shutdown path
is almost done compiling.

51:51.945 --> 51:54.573
Gotta send the command in the next 60
seconds if it's gonna get there in time.

51:54.573 --> 51:56.742
I'm typing as fast as I can.

52:18.388 --> 52:19.389
Okay. Done.

52:20.933 --> 52:21.934
Uplink complete.

53:06.562 --> 53:08.814
Come on. Come on. Come on, Palmer.

53:16.905 --> 53:18.198
<i>No!</i>

53:21.702 --> 53:23.704
Sam? Sam!

53:24.746 --> 53:28.834
<i>The override switch
is locked in the up position.</i>

53:29.334 --> 53:32.921
<i>Looks like
she used her tether to secure it.</i>

53:32.921 --> 53:35.716
<i>The goddamn carabiner's jammed closed.</i>

53:35.716 --> 53:37.676
<i>Gonna have to try and cut through it.</i>

53:38.177 --> 53:39.303
<i>Okay. Do it fast.</i>

53:39.303 --> 53:40.929
<i>We have less than a minute.</i>

54:02.659 --> 54:04.578
Come on. Come on.

54:08.624 --> 54:10.792
<i>I'm almost through.</i>

54:10.792 --> 54:13.253
<i>Hurry, Palmer! You've got 12 seconds.</i>

54:14.296 --> 54:15.756
<i>One last tether.</i>

54:23.347 --> 54:25.641
Ranger. <i>Engine shutdown for Earth burn.</i>

54:25.641 --> 54:26.934
<i>In five.</i>

54:26.934 --> 54:28.018
Four.

54:28.018 --> 54:29.061
<i>Three.</i>

54:29.770 --> 54:32.356
- Two.
- <i>One.</i>

55:30.038 --> 55:33.000
<i>Happy Valley</i>, Ranger<i>.
We have negative engine shutdown.</i>

55:33.000 --> 55:36.086
I say again,
we have negative engine shutdown.

55:36.086 --> 55:38.589
Oh, wow!

55:38.589 --> 55:40.549
Son of a bitch.

55:40.549 --> 55:42.259
Yeah!

56:09.786 --> 56:12.789
Commander, the asteroid
is on track to enter Mars' orbit.

56:14.333 --> 56:16.376
- Commander?
- I heard you.

56:16.919 --> 56:18.295
I just need a minute.

56:36.188 --> 56:37.397
What happened?

56:38.398 --> 56:40.067
Why didn't it work?

56:42.402 --> 56:44.404
The engines are still on.

56:44.404 --> 56:45.489
I don't know.

56:46.114 --> 56:47.533
The calculations were right.

56:47.533 --> 56:50.994
And the code was successfully
inserted into the uplink packet.

56:50.994 --> 56:52.663
Something's off here.

56:53.330 --> 56:55.249
The-The shutdown reactor command was sent,

56:55.249 --> 56:59.545
but it was immediately
superseded by a restart command?

57:01.129 --> 57:02.714
Someone messed with this code.

57:02.714 --> 57:07.803
I even checked to make sure we haven't
missed any contributors to comm latency.

57:10.180 --> 57:11.223
You did this.

57:15.519 --> 57:17.187
You.

57:19.523 --> 57:21.900
What? That's absurd.

57:21.900 --> 57:25.070
Seth was still encoding while I
was writing the command sequence.

57:25.070 --> 57:28.490
And besides, you don't have
the expertise required to know--

57:28.490 --> 57:32.160
Perhaps not,
but I can tell when someone is lying.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.787
As you are now.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.501
Take her into custody.

57:40.085 --> 57:44.131
- Right now. She has deceived--
- Irina, that is a serious accusation.

57:44.131 --> 57:46.508
She and Ayesa have
always had their own agenda.

57:46.508 --> 57:47.926
Aleida.

57:49.052 --> 57:50.637
That's not true, is it?

57:51.555 --> 57:54.600
You di-- Did you do this?

57:55.517 --> 57:59.521
- No. No, I didn't.
- It wasn't her.

58:02.065 --> 58:05.110
I inserted the reactor restart command.

58:06.570 --> 58:08.238
Aleida had nothing to do with it.

58:15.871 --> 58:16.997
No.

58:19.917 --> 58:20.792
Not you.

58:23.337 --> 58:25.422
You shouldn't have done that, Margo.

58:29.259 --> 58:31.386
There will be consequences.

58:32.721 --> 58:33.722
I know.

58:47.736 --> 58:49.655
<i>In a brazen act, an unknown group</i>

58:49.655 --> 58:56.286
has taken control of asteroid 2003LC.
More widely known as Goldilocks.

58:56.286 --> 59:00.123
In light of this action,
the asteroid is no longer headed to Earth

59:00.123 --> 59:02.417
but has in fact gone into Mars' orbit.

59:02.417 --> 59:04.586
<i>News of the asteroid's hijacking</i>

59:04.586 --> 59:06.672
<i>has reverberated around the world</i>

59:06.672 --> 59:09.591
<i>with calls from both presidents
Gore and Korzhenko</i>

59:09.591 --> 59:14.638
<i>to convene an emergency meeting of the M-7
as well as the UN Security Council.</i>

59:14.638 --> 59:15.597
<i>A rare sign of unity--</i>

59:15.597 --> 59:17.975
<i>Authorities say it is still unclear</i>

59:17.975 --> 59:19.726
<i>who exactly is behind the hijacking.</i>

59:19.726 --> 59:24.606
NASA administrator Eli Hobson
has vowed that anyone found to be involved

59:24.606 --> 59:28.318
will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

59:33.740 --> 59:36.326
Stop. We're stationed over there.

59:40.873 --> 59:42.791
Pack them two by two in the corner.

59:46.420 --> 59:47.713
I'll be right back.

59:49.506 --> 59:51.341
- Make sure--
- Guess it's automatic.

59:51.341 --> 59:53.844
- All right. All right.
- This goes in the breech.

01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:03.228
Bishop, what is this?

01:00:03.228 --> 01:00:04.646
We got the green light from Houston.

01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:07.399
To go into North Korea?

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:09.026
Affirmative.

01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:14.948
Isn't this all a little excessive?
It's over.

01:00:14.948 --> 01:00:16.909
We don't know what we're walking into.

01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:18.535
And I have orders.

01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:23.832
I was not told about any of this.

01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:25.876
- Things are moving fast, ma'am.
- That may be.

01:00:25.876 --> 01:00:29.421
But the last time I checked I am
still the commander of this base.

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:32.549
So unless the word comes from me,
there will be no raid.

01:00:33.884 --> 01:00:39.223
Due respect, my orders come directly from
the DOD and they supersede your command.

01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:42.518
Let's move out!

01:00:43.227 --> 01:00:44.645
- Here we go!
- Let's go!

01:00:44.645 --> 01:00:45.979
Okay. Let's move.

01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:03.330
Who else is in your crew?

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.252
Who are you working with?

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.930
What the fuck?

01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:23.517
Oh, God.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.812
Are you okay?

01:01:29.606 --> 01:01:32.234
Come on. Let's get out of here. Let's go.

01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:42.411
<i>Guns in place. Preparing to breach.</i>

01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:44.580
<i>Assessing the situation out. We'll advise.</i>

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.665
<i>Try that one.</i>

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:47.749
They are here.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.251
Shit.

01:01:52.838 --> 01:01:54.631
- Miles, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.135
Do you hear what's happening?

01:01:58.677 --> 01:01:59.678
What?

01:01:59.678 --> 01:02:02.014
They're about to attack
the North Korean quarters.

01:02:02.014 --> 01:02:04.600
Ed, Sparks, Rich,
they're all in there right now.

01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:10.981
We gotta do something.

01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:13.692
- I'm tired of this shit.
- Yeah.

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:17.070
It's time we remind them
who really runs this base. Right?

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.030
Yeah!

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.531
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:21.658
- Who's with me?
- Yeah!

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:28.332
Here. Go ahead.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:30.751
Open that door.

01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:32.044
That's it.

01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:35.214
Sir! The Americans, they are coming in!

01:02:35.214 --> 01:02:36.340
Keep them out!

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.841
We must protect our territory!

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.218
Yes sir! Let's go!

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.650
<i>Confirm...</i>

01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:57.569
<i>Clear!</i>

01:02:59.988 --> 01:03:01.740
Fire in the hole!

01:03:04.493 --> 01:03:05.327
Stay here.

01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:09.623
Three. Two. One.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.333
Stop!

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:17.840
Oh, shit!

01:03:18.382 --> 01:03:20.050
No!

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:27.391
What the fuck is--

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:52.082
My God...

01:04:14.563 --> 01:04:16.356
Hey! All right. Listen.

01:04:16.356 --> 01:04:18.275
That's enough! Let her go!

01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:20.110
- Stop!
- Jesus!

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:24.698
Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:25.949
Break this up.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.409
Hey! Stop! Stop.

01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.535
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:30.120
- Get off of me!
- Break it up!

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.962
- Hey! Hey. Hey!
- Break this up!

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.381
- It's your fault!
- No! Calm down!

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:44.593
- Hey! Break it up! No, no!
- You have got to break it up!

01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:31.181
Dani?

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:40.691
No, no.

01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:43.652
No, no. Hey.

01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:44.987
No. Hey.

01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:47.865
No. No, no.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:51.785
Hey. Hey.

01:05:51.785 --> 01:05:53.078
Help! Come on!

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:56.373
We gotta get her to Dima.
Help me up, Lynn.

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:01.712
Get out of the way.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.214
Clear the way!

01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.304
Maintain pressure.

01:06:11.138 --> 01:06:12.681
Start an IV.

01:06:12.681 --> 01:06:14.016
Inserting line now.

01:06:14.016 --> 01:06:16.351
I need three liters, normal saline.

01:06:16.977 --> 01:06:18.020
Get her on O2.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.105
Hey, Dani. Look at me. Hey.

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.356
You're gonna be fine.

01:06:21.857 --> 01:06:23.775
Okay? You're gonna be fine.

01:06:24.276 --> 01:06:25.611
You got this.

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:29.448
Lungs are wet.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.074
She's aspirating.
And stand by with something.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:32.576
I need room.

01:06:36.288 --> 01:06:39.082
Vitals are failing.
I need to start a central line.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.584
Where is my X-ray?

01:06:40.584 --> 01:06:42.336
We need to operate immediately.

01:06:46.173 --> 01:06:48.592
Pupils are blown. Stay with us, Dani.

01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:50.802
- Still dropping.
- You hang in there, Dani.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.638
Maintain pressure.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.307
Compress rate increasing.

01:06:55.307 --> 01:06:57.351
BP 80 over 40 and falling.

01:06:57.351 --> 01:06:59.770
- Pulse 130, IV below--
- Come on.

01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.948
You can't let them do this.

01:07:52.948 --> 01:07:54.074
I don't have a choice.

01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:57.160
The Russians withdrew
her diplomatic immunity.

01:08:30.736 --> 01:08:32.446
It'll be okay, Aleida.

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:26.750
<i>I've always been captivated
with the idea of justice.</i>

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.171
<i>It's what attracted me
to engineering in the first place.</i>

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:36.844
<i>The sense of right and wrong.</i>

01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:40.389
<i>That I was in control.</i>

01:10:04.705 --> 01:10:06.415
Comrade Morozova,

01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:08.083
please come in.

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.210
<i>But the truth is</i>

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:13.505
<i>the world is not as simple
as we want it to be.</i>

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:19.303
<i>It can't just be boiled down
into an equation.</i>

01:10:23.182 --> 01:10:26.185
<i>Especially when it comes to human beings.</i>

01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:38.614
<i>We are flawed,
unpredictable, and full of contradictions.</i>

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:43.202
<i>It's taken me most of my life to realize</i>

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:47.581
<i>it's exactly these traits
that make us so resilient.</i>

01:10:48.957 --> 01:10:54.838
<i>That give credence to the
improbable idea that anything is possible.</i>

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:01.470
<i>Even in the darkest of times.</i>

01:11:56.525 --> 01:11:59.695
<i>Your Honor, I was always told</i>

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:03.699
<i>that we shouldn't let personal feelings
cloud our search for the truth.</i>

01:12:06.368 --> 01:12:07.995
<i>But looking back now,</i>

01:12:09.413 --> 01:12:11.123
<i>I don't think that's right.</i>

01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:14.459
<i>Our feelings may not be convenient.</i>

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.882
<i>They may even slow our progress.</i>

01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:26.638
<i>But they are also the only way to truly
begin to understand</i>

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:30.142
<i>the world around us.</i>

01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:35.814
<i>And the new worlds that await us.</i>
