What can I help you with today?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.793
You're petitioning
for a name change?

01:37.793 --> 01:40.796
Danish Graves for
the petitioner, Marlin Everett.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.366
You'll see in the file
that all of the required forms

01:45.366 --> 01:47.846
have been signed and notarized.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.467
314.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.556
Still me.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.776
Danish Graves
for the petitioner,

02:04.776 --> 02:06.865
John Sasquatch.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.824
You'll see in the file

02:08.824 --> 02:11.479
that all of the required forms
have been signed

02:11.479 --> 02:13.307
and notarized.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.917
I think there's been a mistake.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.353
No, ma'am.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.529
The filing is correct.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.749
Are you saying you're here
with two clients today

02:20.749 --> 02:23.360
and they both want to change
their name to the same thing?

02:23.360 --> 02:25.971
Three, actually, ma'am.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.080
Sign it.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.865
Let's go.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.910
It says "Nadine Tillman."

02:51.910 --> 02:53.434
I can't. I'm not...

02:54.391 --> 02:56.959
I'm Dot. Dorothy.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.743
You're nothing.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.006
Sign it.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.370
Uh...

03:20.635 --> 03:21.723
Hey.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.085
How's your brother there, Kim?

03:36.085 --> 03:38.043
Huh? Ole Pete.

03:38.957 --> 03:41.699
Stayin' out of trouble?

03:41.699 --> 03:44.049
Sure would hate
to send him back to prison.

03:45.616 --> 03:46.835
Now, why don't you print us up

03:46.835 --> 03:49.403
a fresh, new release form

03:49.403 --> 03:51.448
so we can get this done proper.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.974
You want to make a mess of this?

03:56.888 --> 03:58.629
That what you want?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.327
'Cause if someone gets hurt,

04:00.327 --> 04:02.372
I'm gonna pull my sidearm--
that's on you.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.552

04:16.038 --> 04:18.258
You're just an idiot. Wait here.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.485
Mrs. Lyon?

04:30.879 --> 04:32.881
No. That's not--

04:32.881 --> 04:34.448
Little far from home,
aren't you?

04:35.405 --> 04:37.451
You need something, Trooper?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.591
Everything all right?

04:47.591 --> 04:49.724
Eh, she's fine.

04:49.724 --> 04:50.899
Mm-hmm.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.814
Just took a spill, is all.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.381
Finishing up some paperwork
and then--

04:54.381 --> 04:55.817
Heading home.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.079
Right? How we doing there, Kim?

04:58.210 --> 04:59.734
Back to Minnesota,
you're saying?

04:59.734 --> 05:00.822
I'm...

05:00.822 --> 05:03.172
Oh. Nadine's gonna...

05:03.172 --> 05:05.217
spend some time
with us here now.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.046
That your idea?

05:09.004 --> 05:10.266
Mm.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.529
'Cause I can drive you home.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.096
My shift's over.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.938
- We should go.
- Mrs. Lyon?

05:29.938 --> 05:31.287
Dorothy?

05:32.593 --> 05:34.116
I can help.

05:34.116 --> 05:36.292
Son, the lady said
it's no concern to you.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.381
I heard her.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.253
But, see...

05:41.253 --> 05:42.864
...I was drawn
into a chain of events

05:42.864 --> 05:44.518
last time
Mrs. Lyon was kidnapped.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.562
Kidnapped?

05:45.562 --> 05:46.650
That never happened.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.304
Mm.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.090
Uh, see, son...

05:52.090 --> 05:53.570
I'm the sheriff of this county.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.572
Now, I know
you're not sitting here

05:55.572 --> 05:57.835
telling me
I'm a suspect in some...

05:57.835 --> 06:00.403
imaginary crime, so...

06:00.403 --> 06:01.578
move out of my way

06:01.578 --> 06:03.928
before I move you.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.890
Listen to me.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.370
You don't have to go with him.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.241
I can have backup here

06:12.241 --> 06:13.808
in ten minutes.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.026
Well, that's gonna be too late.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.289
Surprise.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.378
This is all just...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.728
a bit of silliness.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.033
I'm fine. Really.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.774
Thank you...

06:23.774 --> 06:25.080
for your kind offer.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.038
Go home, please.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.214
Tell Wayne I'll be there soon.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.738
Time to go, Jay-Z.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.524
Don't touch me.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.919
Ooh.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.703
He's sensitive.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.967
Careful, boys.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.709
I think Officer Nightstick's
on his period today.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.844
Roy.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.416
If you hurt him,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.374
I won't come.

07:05.555 --> 07:06.600
We're leaving.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.449
Officer Olmstead.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.886
<i>Uh, Trooper Witt Farr
on this end.</i>

07:31.886 --> 07:33.757
<i>This a good moment?</i>

07:33.757 --> 07:36.934
Yeah, just threw a couple
elderly out of their homes.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.501
Evictions.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.678
You know,
so-called "public service."

07:41.678 --> 07:42.940
What you got?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.072
<i>Well...</i>

07:44.072 --> 07:45.334
a bad feeling.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.205
<i>Don't like the sounds of that.</i>

07:47.205 --> 07:48.729
I just saw her.

07:48.729 --> 07:49.860
Dorothy Lyon.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.514
Where?

07:51.514 --> 07:52.907
<i>I'm at the hospital
outside Bismarck.</i>

07:52.907 --> 07:54.386
<i>Just got her files.</i>

07:54.386 --> 07:56.258
She was in an auto accident.
Seemed fine.

07:56.258 --> 07:59.174
A little banged-up. But, um,
guess who was checking her out.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.263
<i>Roy Tillman.</i>

08:01.263 --> 08:02.482
You saw this?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.831
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

08:03.831 --> 08:05.223
I tried to step in,
take her home,

08:05.223 --> 08:07.356
but, uh...

08:07.356 --> 08:09.184
well, he had strength
in numbers.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.794
Where is she now?

08:10.794 --> 08:11.795
<i>Tillman's got a ranch</i>

08:11.795 --> 08:13.275
out on Route 11.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.711
My guess is they went there.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.583
What was her demeanor?

08:16.583 --> 08:19.107
<i>Like one of those hostage videos
you watch on the Internet.</i>

08:19.107 --> 08:21.022
Seemed agreeable to it
with her words,

08:21.022 --> 08:22.719
but, uh...

08:22.719 --> 08:24.939
her eyes...

08:24.939 --> 08:27.376
like a... like a trapped animal.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.075
I left a message with the FBI.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.164
Yeah, they never return calls.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.563
Your day is coming.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.522
I don't think you want
to start off lippy, Nadine.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.046
This is just
a temporary measure.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.875
You don't even have a plan,
do you?

09:34.965 --> 09:37.054
God has a plan.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.491
And what is that?

09:41.058 --> 09:43.278
Must be cold,
living out there in the dark,

09:43.278 --> 09:45.672
so let me spell it out for you.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.110
You made a promise.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.547
To Him. To me.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.896
You broke your vow.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.463
You broke my fingers.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.117
My collarbone.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.640
Three ribs.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.163
You dislocated my jaw.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.991
I was trying to fix you.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.820
Like a window cleaner
pissing on a window.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.302
There's that mouth.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.260
Let me go.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.612
Let me go.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.439
Let me go!

10:14.439 --> 10:16.572
I'm just gonna let you tire
yourself out, like a horse

10:16.572 --> 10:18.705
with a bit in its mouth
for the first time.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.190
Please, I can't be here.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.585
I'm Scotty's mother.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.242
She said ice cream cake
for her birthday

10:34.242 --> 10:36.157
and I forgot to order it,

10:36.157 --> 10:38.681
and there's a three-day minimum.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.597
She just started a new school
and the girls are being mean.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.296
There's Thanksgiving
and Christmas.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.733
This is probably
the last year she's gonna

10:46.733 --> 10:48.386
believe in Santa Claus.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.301
And I can't unsee it.

10:50.301 --> 10:53.478
Her sitting on Santa's lap at
the mall and he's askin' her,

10:53.478 --> 10:55.089
"What do you want
for Christmas, little girl?"

10:55.089 --> 10:57.178
And she's saying,
"I want my mommy back."

10:58.832 --> 11:00.398
It's not just me.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.271
What you're doing,
you're doing to them, too.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.926
And we're getting kittens
next year,

11:05.926 --> 11:07.797
we decided, and who's gonna
be there to teach Scotty

11:07.797 --> 11:09.973
how to take care of them?

11:09.973 --> 11:12.410
Plus, I am den mother
for the Girl Scouts,

11:12.410 --> 11:14.238
and I raise money
for the library.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.023
- Enough!
- No.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.679
I'm in love.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.159
True love.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.118
With the most wonderful man.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
He's my best friend.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.601
We went ice-skating
on our first date.

11:29.601 --> 11:32.169
And if you ask him,
Wayne'll tell you

11:32.169 --> 11:34.519
shepherd's pie
is still his favorite food.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.826
We just started watching
<i>Call the Midwife.</i>

11:36.826 --> 11:39.133
And there's, like,
13 seasons of that show.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.091
So if...

11:41.091 --> 11:43.137
if I don't come home...

11:43.137 --> 11:45.835
who's gonna remind him to take
Lactaid when he eats cheese?

11:47.228 --> 11:49.143
You made a vow.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.492
I was a child.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.928
Oh, please.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.235
You had your hair,
you had your menses.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.889
And you had a wife and a son

11:55.889 --> 11:57.586
almost my age, which was 15.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.153
I don't care.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.981
You made a mistake
when you left me.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.939
That means everything come
after that is a mistake, too.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.202
My daughter is not a mistake.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.683
Fruit of the poison tree.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.947
That's a legal way of saying
two wrongs don't make a right.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.602
You belong to me.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.173
Do you know how crazy you sound?

12:20.435 --> 12:22.959
The way you see things,
your mind.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.570
But you believe it's the world
that's gone mad.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.100
I have to go.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.494
I tell you what, Nadine.

12:36.494 --> 12:39.454
I'll promise you, hand to God...

12:39.454 --> 12:42.022
I'll promise to let you go
just as soon as you beg me

12:42.022 --> 12:44.676
to let you stay and mean it.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.854
You want a promise?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.771
I'll make you a promise.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.776
I'm gonna kill you.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.215
Oh, Nadine.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.653
The devil is dancing a jig

13:04.653 --> 13:06.960
on your tongue tonight,
isn't he?

13:06.960 --> 13:09.658
Just a-jumpin' and a-jivin'.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.272
Come on in, Karen.

13:15.272 --> 13:18.014
This is Nadine.
Nadine, this is Karen, my wife.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.973
The mother of my children.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.195
Bring it in, boys.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.632
The girls are outside with Dad.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.114
We need to get going
if you don't want to be late

13:31.114 --> 13:32.115
- for the sheriff debate.
- Yeah.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.987
Roy was just explaining

13:33.987 --> 13:36.250
how one more wife
and he gets a set

13:36.250 --> 13:38.121
- of steak knives
- Shut up!

13:38.121 --> 13:40.776
I don't want to hear you speak.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.605
Not once to me.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.520
Not ever.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.653
Be in the truck.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.354
Well?

13:54.485 --> 13:56.792
Third time's a charm.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.920
Lars?

14:48.975 --> 14:50.280
Lars?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.805
Lars, what are you doing in bed?

14:53.805 --> 14:56.156
It's the middle of the day.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.201
What-what are you doing home?

14:58.201 --> 15:00.421
Told you yesterday.
Double shift.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.076
- No.
- Just got to change
my togs and get back--

15:04.033 --> 15:05.905
Hi.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.086
Move.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.008
You need to be gone
when I get home.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.141
Where am I supposed to go?

15:25.141 --> 15:26.708
I don't care.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.406
Sorry.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.583
"Sorry"? What are you sorry for?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.934
Besides betraying
all women everywhere.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.371
Go ahead, take him.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.981
He's useless.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.635
- I don't want him.
- Hey.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.899
You know, I, too,
would like a wife.

15:43.899 --> 15:47.294
Or, heck,
I'd even settle for a husband.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.252
A real man.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
Someone who pulls his weight.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.343
- Contributes.
- Hey, you know what?

15:53.343 --> 15:55.955
- I contribute, okay?
- You don't do shit.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.609
You don't work.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.569
Any clothes on your back,
I paid for.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.006
You can't get to the grocery
or put your dirty

16:04.006 --> 16:05.486
drawers in the hamper.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.749
You can't even
shovel the walk or...

16:07.749 --> 16:10.056
remember my birthday
to save your goddamn life.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.276
You'd sooner sit in the dark
than change a light bulb.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.105
And you'd rather die
than say thank you

16:16.105 --> 16:17.672
to the person that does.

16:17.672 --> 16:20.414
So... good luck to you.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.111
You can leave the toilet seat up

16:22.111 --> 16:24.026
on someone else's life
from now on.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.470
Shame on you.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.951
Both of you.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.052
Oh, for Pete's sake.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.272
Wait! Wait!

16:52.272 --> 16:54.709
Wait! Please, wait!

16:58.104 --> 17:00.106
Are you kidding me?

17:47.370 --> 17:49.851
Come on.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.038
All right, hey,
how we doing there?

18:03.038 --> 18:04.387
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18:06.041 --> 18:09.044
Why don't you take a seat
in the front row there?

18:10.001 --> 18:12.613
Welcome, Sheriff Roy Tillman.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.658
Is that Miss Cordell?
What do you got there tonight?

18:14.658 --> 18:16.965
Please.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.271
What an honor.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.022
A little bit, uh,
crowded up here, huh?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.850
Well, say hello
to the other candidates

18:32.850 --> 18:34.722
for Sheriff of Stark County.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.506
Roy Andrew Tillman,

18:36.506 --> 18:38.508
Roy Chester Tillman and Roy--

18:38.508 --> 18:40.293
Roy Floyd Tillman.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.035
The fuck is this?

18:44.035 --> 18:46.690
No, no. No, son, no, no.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.562
They're not gonna have trouble
hearing me out there.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.999
Sheriff Tillman,
the first question is for you.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.610
Well, now, Miss Cordell, I
appreciate your giddyup there,

18:53.610 --> 18:55.786
but someone's gonna have
to answer my question first.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.266
Uh...

18:57.266 --> 18:59.050
is Jerry here?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.401
Election Jerry. Jerry Belknap.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.403
Where you at?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.189
Who put you up to this?

19:07.189 --> 19:09.800
Sheriff Tillman, given the types

19:09.800 --> 19:11.889
of criminal arrests
and incidents we typically see

19:11.889 --> 19:13.761
in Stark County,
how do you justify

19:13.761 --> 19:16.372
spending half a million dollars
on war-grade

19:16.372 --> 19:18.113
weapons and tactical gear?

19:18.113 --> 19:19.810
Okay, well, Anndrea,
I'm gonna have

19:19.810 --> 19:21.638
to disagree
with your numbers there.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.988
Does Stark County
really need a tank?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.563
As sheriff, my first priority

19:33.563 --> 19:35.739
is the safety of the community.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.437
That means preparedness
and defense--

19:37.437 --> 19:39.090
Safety of the community.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.570
- That means preparedness.
- Preparedness and defense.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.703
Uh, sorry, fellas,
I'm still talking here.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.139
I'm still talking.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.839
All right, that's a good joke.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.754
Good joke.

19:50.754 --> 19:53.017
Cut it out!

19:53.017 --> 19:55.324
- Cut it out.
- Out.
- Out.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.979
All right, you know what,
this is bullshit.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.987
Lady, I don't know what kind
of deal you're running here,

20:05.987 --> 20:07.293
but this is a travesty. Come on.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.164
Let's go, let's go.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.340
Are you guys even on the ballot?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.386
- Are you guys
even on the ballot?
- Sheriff!

20:13.386 --> 20:15.301
- Let's get one
with all the Tillmans together.
- No pictures.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.911
- Hey, that's assault!
- Sheriff!

21:11.531 --> 21:13.010
Okay.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.929
Damn it.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.844
Ooh.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.585
Ooh...

21:34.075 --> 21:35.859
Shouldn't you be at the debate?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.736
Dad wanted me to hang back.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.303
No?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.094
What'd you tell the FBI?

21:53.094 --> 21:54.617
Me? Nothing.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.750
I saw you.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.100
With those two agents
at the hospital.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.276
That is 1,000% on you.

22:02.669 --> 22:03.887
They came to me.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.498
Why?

22:05.498 --> 22:08.022
Because you're sloppy as shit.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.329
And that leaves folks
asking questions.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.332
Why were you kidnapped?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.335
Why did your house burn down?

22:22.906 --> 22:24.952
I never told anyone anything.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.656
Gator, I saw your mom.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.009
What?

22:39.009 --> 22:40.707
Linda.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.492
I saw Linda.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.407
She's safe.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.323
She didn't want to leave you.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.717
She wouldn't.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.719
If she had the choice.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.287
You understand?

22:59.073 --> 23:00.944
He was gonna kill her.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.121
So she had to go
to save herself.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.386
But she was coming back for you.

23:08.343 --> 23:09.605
I was bringing her back.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.869
What the fuck
are you talking about?

23:13.827 --> 23:15.481
I'm saying...

23:15.481 --> 23:17.570
your mom...

23:17.570 --> 23:19.180
she made it.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.530
She got away and she's safe.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.445
And I can take you there
if you help me.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.012
But we got to go right now.

23:27.928 --> 23:31.105
You're such a liar.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.847
You never told the truth,
not once in your life.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.110
I swear I can take you to her.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.680
No.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.856
I'm not going anywhere.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.947
Neither are you.

23:50.254 --> 23:53.214
Did you ever wonder
why you're not named Roy?

23:54.171 --> 23:56.260
Huh?

23:56.260 --> 23:58.480
You're the fifth boy

23:58.480 --> 24:01.701
in a long line
of first-born Roys.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.444
Your name's supposed to be Roy.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.185
But your dad said he took one
look at you in the hospital--

24:08.185 --> 24:10.884
this pale, puny lizard--

24:10.884 --> 24:13.016
and he knew you'd be
a loser for life.

24:15.236 --> 24:16.498
Said he'd rather
have his name die out

24:16.498 --> 24:18.500
than have you to carry it.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.158
Ask him.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.816
Hope you die in here, Nadine.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.122
Never see your daughter again.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.387
No, you don't.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.434
Yes, I fucking do.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.630
You need to drive away.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.675
I'm gonna shoot you
for trespassing.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.721
Not until I talk to Mrs. Lyon.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.118
Next one goes in your head.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.395
I know you don't think
they're coming.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.180
Consequences.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.923
But they're almost here.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.621
Bye-bye.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.497
You see him again,
you shoot on sight.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.794
Fucking bitch.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.940
No, just tell her it went well

27:17.940 --> 27:19.986
and I'm heading back now.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.945
Nah, believe me,
after what I saw,

27:22.945 --> 27:25.339
couldn't get elected
to lick the road clean.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.083
Yeah, okay, bye.

28:04.944 --> 28:06.989
Mr. Graves?

28:08.948 --> 28:10.427
You gave me your card.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.081
Deputy Witt Farr.
We met over

28:12.081 --> 28:14.997
in the Twin Cities
at the hospital after the fire?

28:14.997 --> 28:17.739
Uh, of course.
Yeah, you're, uh--

28:17.739 --> 28:20.220
- Deputy Witt Farr, like I said.
- Yeah.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.396
Can I ask, uh...

28:22.396 --> 28:24.137
are you here for Mrs. Lyon?

28:24.137 --> 28:26.182
Well, I work for Mrs. Lyon,
so yes.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.836
No, Dorothy Lyon.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.229
The daughter-in-law.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.621
What about her?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.188
She's at the ranch.

28:32.188 --> 28:34.887
Roy Tillman, the sheriff?

28:34.887 --> 28:36.671
He's the ex-husband
who tried to kidnap her.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.804
I think maybe you know this.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.588
Anyway.

28:40.588 --> 28:43.025
He has her right now.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.027
And I don't think
she wants to be there.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.812
You spoke to her?

28:46.812 --> 28:48.770
She was in the county hospital
and he took her out.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.164
Roy and three deputies.

28:51.164 --> 28:54.167
Now, look, she said she was
going of her own free will,

28:54.167 --> 28:56.169
which ties my hands,
but I'm telling you,

28:56.169 --> 28:58.171
as her lawyer...

28:58.171 --> 29:00.260
she's kidnapped.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.786
<i>Car 15,
respond to a 10-99 in progress.</i>

29:05.961 --> 29:07.963
I got to go.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.749
Okay. I'll, uh...

29:12.315 --> 29:14.013
Look.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.145
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.801
I don't know how long she's got.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.890
Uh, what are you saying?

30:06.587 --> 30:08.632
Well, that was just awful.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.113
The way they were laughing
at you--

30:11.113 --> 30:12.462
Karen.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.162
You can fix it, though.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.859
I know it.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.556
Karen, I swear,

30:19.556 --> 30:21.994
you're a bag of bolts
in the brains department.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.083
The way you're talking.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.172
- Can't you see the man's upset?
- I just...

30:31.003 --> 30:32.874
Don't you see?

30:34.136 --> 30:36.965
It's a curse, is what it is.

30:36.965 --> 30:40.316
This woman comes back
after all these years.

30:40.316 --> 30:42.841
Laughing at you.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.799
Mocking your piety,

30:44.799 --> 30:46.888
the things that we believe.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.674
Rubbing her sins in our face.

30:52.763 --> 30:55.027
She's the albatross.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.116
Hmm? It's not me.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.651
What are you doing?

33:21.651 --> 33:23.871
What are you-- No. Roy, wait--

33:26.787 --> 33:28.136
Don't do it, Nadine.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.920
Don't make it worse.

33:41.671 --> 33:42.890
Mm.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.110
I remember this game.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.943
Last chance, Roy.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.164
You want to go another round?

33:57.165 --> 33:59.254
- To let me go.
- Oh.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.908
You're thinking you're just
gonna stroll right out of here,

34:00.908 --> 34:02.257
huh?

34:02.257 --> 34:04.781
Someone's gonna hold the door
for you?

34:39.381 --> 34:41.775
-"And on her forehead
was written a name of mystery."
- No. No.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.733
Oh!

34:44.778 --> 34:46.432
"Babylon the great,

34:46.432 --> 34:49.348
mother of prostitutes
and abominations of Earth."

34:50.436 --> 34:51.872
"And I saw the woman was drunk

34:51.872 --> 34:53.656
"with the blood of the saints...

34:53.656 --> 34:55.963
...and the blood
of the martyrs of Jesus."

34:59.314 --> 35:00.533
Roy.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.795
Not now, brother.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.014
The lesson's almost taught.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.364
Lawyer at the gate.
Danish Graves.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.411
Wanting to see you.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.374
I'll be right there.

35:22.903 --> 35:23.904
No.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.384
No, no, no, no. No!

35:25.384 --> 35:27.690
No!

35:28.648 --> 35:29.823
There's only one way

35:29.823 --> 35:30.911
you're getting out of here.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.219
Oh, I will.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.003
I will!

35:36.003 --> 35:37.396
I've done it before.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.224
No.

35:39.224 --> 35:43.141
See, you've always been here, Nadine.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.273
It was the rest
that was just a dream.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.800
I'll get away.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.020
Same as Linda.

35:53.020 --> 35:56.197
Oh, you'll end up same as Linda.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.644
I'll bury you right next to her.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.065
Mrs. Lyon, I've been trying
to reach you all day.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.285
Yes. You decided
to take the job.

36:40.285 --> 36:41.808
Smart cookie.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.505
I can't do it anymore--
put my needs last.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.899
Like on an airplane, you know?

36:45.899 --> 36:48.684
I got to put my mask on first.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.033
Ah.

36:50.033 --> 36:52.949
Uh, but that's not why I'm here.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.560
I know where Dorothy is.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.953
- You found her?
- Not me.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.912
The sheriff.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.435
Where is she?

37:00.435 --> 37:02.350
He took her back to his ranch.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.570
Come on.
You're starting right now.

38:06.893 --> 38:10.723
I'm here!

38:10.723 --> 38:12.725
I'm--

38:26.869 --> 38:30.569
<i>This is the process.</i>

38:34.094 --> 38:35.704
<i>I'm sorry for leaving you.</i>

39:01.774 --> 39:03.341
Well...

39:05.647 --> 39:07.475
Thanks for seeing me, Sheriff.

39:16.136 --> 39:17.616
Okay.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.967
I'll get right to the point.

39:21.968 --> 39:25.537
Today was humiliating for you.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.714
I know you're sitting there
thinking it wasn't that bad.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.543
But, believe me, it was.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.240
Worse than you know.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.894
A lot worse.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.941
You should probably have
a drink.

39:40.682 --> 39:43.032
You're gonna lose
your election, Roy.

39:43.032 --> 39:45.165
Understand that.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.733
It's gone.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.126
Out of your grasp.

39:50.126 --> 39:53.173
You'll be lucky if you aren't
charged with assault.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.350
But...

39:58.091 --> 40:00.354
...I can fix it for you.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.530
All those other Roy Tillmans?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.314
I can make them disappear...

40:05.359 --> 40:07.405
...as quick as I made them.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.971
Mm.

40:22.332 --> 40:25.379
My client...

40:25.379 --> 40:27.686
...is prepared to deliver
this election to you...

40:29.383 --> 40:33.300
...in exchange for the immediate
return of her daughter-in-law.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.738
That's a good deal, Roy.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.653
It's smart.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.613
And you'd be smart to take it
while it's still on the table.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.660
Here's a question.

40:50.578 --> 40:51.927
If you're so smart...

41:14.907 --> 41:17.257
...then why are you so dead?

41:33.795 --> 41:35.275
No.

45:42.217 --> 45:44.176
<i>Now I get it.</i>
