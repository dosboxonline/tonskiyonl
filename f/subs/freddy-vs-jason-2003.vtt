00:29.396 --> 00:31.193
My children...

00:31.232 --> 00:33.359
from the very beginning...

00:33.400 --> 00:37.928
it was the children
who gave me my power.

00:37.972 --> 00:41.032
The Springwood Slasher...

00:41.075 --> 00:43.066
that's what they called me.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.494
My reign of terror
was legendary.

01:10.537 --> 01:14.701
Dozens of children
would fall by my blades.

01:18.145 --> 01:22.138
Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...

01:27.821 --> 01:32.155
taking justice
into their own hands.

01:34.228 --> 01:38.358
When I was alive, I might
have been a little naughty...

01:38.399 --> 01:40.196
but after they killed me,

01:40.234 --> 01:43.692
I became something much,
much worse--

01:43.737 --> 01:46.865
the stuff nightmares
are made of.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.475
The children
still feared me...

01:49.510 --> 01:53.606
and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.

01:53.647 --> 01:58.016
And that's when the fun
really began!

02:01.355 --> 02:06.793
Until they figured out
a way to forget about me...

02:06.827 --> 02:09.853
to erase me completely!

02:09.896 --> 02:11.694
Being dead wasn't a problem.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.963
But being forgotten--
now, that's a bitch!

02:18.872 --> 02:20.203
It's only a dream!

02:20.240 --> 02:21.730
Die, motherfucker!

02:21.775 --> 02:25.006
I can't come back
if nobody remembers me!

02:25.045 --> 02:29.379
I can't come back
if nobody's afraid!

02:33.554 --> 02:37.251
I had to search the bowels of hell...

02:37.291 --> 02:40.192
but I found someone...

02:40.227 --> 02:43.993
someone who'll make 'em remember.

02:44.031 --> 02:48.695
He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.

02:48.736 --> 02:53.230
And that fear is my ticket home.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.735
Mike?

02:58.078 --> 02:59.511
Is that you?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.148
All right, fuck you, then.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.174
I'm heading in.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.127
Mike?

03:23.170 --> 03:25.195
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.253
No!

05:02.369 --> 05:03.700
Jason.

05:09.443 --> 05:13.311
I should've been watching
them, not drinking...

05:13.347 --> 05:15.338
not meeting a boy
at the lake.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.144
I deserve to be punished.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.677
We all deserved
to be punished.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.418
Jason.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.488
My special, special boy.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.896
Do you know what
your gift is?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.490
No matter what they do to you...

05:33.534 --> 05:35.661
you cannot die.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.193
You can never die.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.765
You've just been
sleeping, honey.

05:41.808 --> 05:46.871
But now the time
has come to wake up.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.075
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.347
I need you to go
to Elm Street.

05:55.389 --> 06:00.122
The children have been
very bad on Elm Street.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.788
Rise up, Jason!

06:02.829 --> 06:06.128
Your work isn't finished!

06:06.166 --> 06:10.000
Hear my voice and live again!

06:19.846 --> 06:23.373
Make them remember me, Jason.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.477
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

06:28.855 --> 06:33.883
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.036
Marry, fuck, or kill?
Your choices are--

07:17.070 --> 07:18.628
your choices
are the Three Stooges.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.832
Go, Kia.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.205
Oh, God...

07:22.242 --> 07:25.370
Which one had
the super-bad toupee hair?

07:25.412 --> 07:27.471
Harry, Mar--

07:27.514 --> 07:29.311
No! No, no, no.
It was Moe.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.216
Either one, I'd kill him.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.344
OK, who'd you fuck, then?

07:33.387 --> 07:34.684
This is stupid, y'all.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.484
Come on. Come on.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.649
Oh, God. Whatever, look.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.181
I'd fuck the bald guy,
and I'd marry Larry.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.456
Jesus. Is this what
we're doing all night?

07:41.495 --> 07:43.861
'Cause, y'all,
this is really stank.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.161
Hey! Gibb, what are you doing?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.223
I thought you were gonna quit.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.825
I only smoke when I drink now.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.496
But you're always drinking.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.164
Yeah, well, I'll work
on that next.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.670
Hey, OK.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.675
I got another one.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.507
Fred, Scooby, or Shaggy?

07:58.545 --> 08:00.911
Oh! I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.745
Do you guys think
I should get a nose job?

08:03.784 --> 08:04.978
Oh, my God.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.646
Oh, please, Kia, what you need
is a lobotomy.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.318
I think I'm gonna
get some candles.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.988
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.994
Are you sure you
should be driving?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.830
I'm so under the limit, Lori.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.296
Surprise.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.964
Oh, Trey.
You answered my prayers.

08:26.006 --> 08:26.995
Thank you.

08:28.008 --> 08:28.975
Whoa, babe!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.135
What'd I tell you
about kissing me...

08:30.177 --> 08:31.474
after you've smoked, huh?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.138
Lighten up.
They're menthols.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.477
Yeah. I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.914
It's Lori.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.316
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.341
Whatever.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.182
Where are the ladies?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.921
Relax, they'll be here.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.485
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.326
Did you know they
were coming over?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.832
Listen, you gotta be quiet.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.165
Hey, we knew you were be here
all alone this weekend.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.172
Blake's cute.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.072
He's not my type.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.508
Oh! Who is? No one's
ever gonna live up...

09:03.543 --> 09:06.535
to the fuzzy memory
of your first love, Lori.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.377
You were fucking fourteen,
so get over it.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.939
Yeah, I know
we were young...

09:09.983 --> 09:12.076
but what Will and l
had was real.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.110
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

09:14.154 --> 09:16.816
but didn't Mr. Real
just drop-kick your ass...

09:16.857 --> 09:18.757
without so much
as a good-bye handshake?

09:18.792 --> 09:22.489
He ever even call or maybe even
write to you after he moved?

09:22.529 --> 09:23.791
Send you an e-mail?

09:23.830 --> 09:25.161
No.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.257
You see my point?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.495
It's time to leave
the convent, Lori.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.265
You need to meet a guy.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.419
Hey, Lori...

09:51.458 --> 09:54.723
I like the...
flow of your place.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.695
Got good feng shui.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.595
Yeah.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.698
You know about feng shui?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.107
Oh, oh!

10:10.143 --> 10:11.110
Oh, you should see her bedroom!

10:11.144 --> 10:13.942
-Hmm?
-Great flow in there.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.710
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.081
Shut up!

10:20.420 --> 10:22.047
I got a kink in my neck.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.751
Come on.
You can massage it out for me.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.118
I think I need
a few more drinks...

10:29.162 --> 10:31.426
before there'll be
any massaging.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.395
What do you see in him?

10:34.434 --> 10:37.369
I don't know,
but he has a cute ass.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.805
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.342
So, Lori...

10:48.381 --> 10:50.406
am I gonna get that
grand tour or what?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.748
Yeah.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.310
You know, why don't you
start in the kitchen...

10:54.354 --> 10:55.514
and get us some beers?

10:55.555 --> 10:56.920
Cool.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.324
Oh, my God, Kia,
he is a total idiot.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.352
Get him out of here.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.661
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.860
I don't like him.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.869
You know what?
You don't like anybody.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.632
I mean, Lori, you've
barely gone out since--

11:11.671 --> 11:13.798
Since what?
Since my mom died?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.535
Yeah, well, you know what?
My dad needs me.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.566
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time...

11:17.611 --> 11:20.910
and if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.516
Yeah, fuck me, baby!

12:18.038 --> 12:20.472
Your back door was open.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.599
I closed it.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.074
Mmm.

12:23.109 --> 12:27.546
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, OK?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.242
Fine. I'll go have
a shower then.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.551
Good.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.919
Your hair smells like
menthols, anyway.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.652
Asshole.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.414
Trey!

13:37.450 --> 13:40.283
What the hell are you doing?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.097
Help us! Help us!

14:01.141 --> 14:03.837
Oh, my God!

14:03.877 --> 14:06.107
Over here!

14:06.146 --> 14:08.046
Please help us!

14:08.081 --> 14:09.048
Help us!

14:09.082 --> 14:10.413
You kids need
some assistance?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.543
What the fuck
do you think?!

14:12.585 --> 14:14.485
We need to lock this down now.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.045
Keep it contained, you hear me?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.613
Killed in bed.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.387
Jesus.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.861
It's even the same damn house.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.386
1428 Elm.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.262
It's gotta be him, right?

14:26.299 --> 14:27.857
It's gotta be
Freddy Krueger.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.868
Hey! Don't even say...

14:28.902 --> 14:29.869
that son of a bitch's
name out loud.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.098
Let's just keep it together.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.606
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.131
Take all the kids
down to the station.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.700
Keep them separate.
Do it now.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.143
Yes, sir.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.441
We'll be in touch.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.471
Thank you.
Let's go home.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.652
So?

14:48.688 --> 14:49.916
She doesn't know anything.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.447
None of them do.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.584
I'm pretty sure we're good.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.685
Pretty sure?
You better make damn sure...

14:55.728 --> 14:56.888
none of those kids
knows anything...

14:56.930 --> 14:59.296
or I'll send your ass up
to Westin Hills with them.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.731
Knows what?
What do you mean?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.701
Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.828
Right place, right time.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.771
But we'll take it
from here, all right?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.746
Your father's on his way.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.909
Do they know who did this?

15:17.951 --> 15:20.010
No, not yet.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.179
But I thought I heard...

15:21.221 --> 15:22.916
one of the officers
mention a name.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.548
You know, to tell
you the truth, Lori...

15:24.591 --> 15:26.786
I--I just moved here
about a month ago...

15:26.826 --> 15:29.226
but if they have a suspect,
I'd be the first to know.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.025
But they asked me all these
really weird questions...

15:31.064 --> 15:32.361
Iike about my dreams--

15:41.975 --> 15:43.636
What was the name?

15:45.411 --> 15:47.402
What was the name?

15:52.519 --> 15:54.180
Freddy.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.469
Hello?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.250
Are you OK?

17:12.298 --> 17:15.131
His name is Freddy Krueger...

17:15.167 --> 17:20.935
and he loves children,
especially little girls.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.568
Freddy's coming back.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.238
Soon he'll be strong enough.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.612
It's OK to be afraid.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.742
We were all afraid.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.276
Warn your friends.
Warn everyone.

17:45.164 --> 17:49.624
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you

17:49.669 --> 17:53.435
Three, four,
better lock the door

17:53.473 --> 17:57.807
Five, six, grab a crucifix

17:57.844 --> 18:01.678
Seven, eight,
try to stay up late

18:01.714 --> 18:05.810
Nine, ten, never sleep again

18:05.852 --> 18:10.380
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you...

18:17.563 --> 18:21.021
Blake, we have to talk.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.364
What the hell were you
doing over there?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.773
You were supposed to be
watching your sister.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.334
Were you drinking?

18:32.378 --> 18:35.347
My best friend was
just killed, Dad!

18:35.381 --> 18:39.078
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

18:40.887 --> 18:43.014
You watch yourself, boy.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.336
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.703
Cop let it slip.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.298
It was somebody named Freddy.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.436
I'm gonna take him out
myself, Trey.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.777
I swear to God.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.326
Who is that?

19:25.365 --> 19:28.163
Someone there?

19:37.443 --> 19:38.569
Jesus.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.115
I'm OK. I'm all right.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.859
Not strong enough yet.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.388
Well, I will be soon enough.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.698
Until then...

20:03.736 --> 20:06.933
I'll let Jason have some fun.

20:16.149 --> 20:17.411
Dad?

20:42.575 --> 20:46.170
Hypnocil.
What does this shit do, anyway?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.839
How come we all
have to take it?

20:47.880 --> 20:51.577
It keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.679
I'm fine with that.

20:58.558 --> 21:02.255
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.262
After tonight's murder...

21:03.296 --> 21:05.127
in this neighborhood
of Springwood...

21:05.164 --> 21:06.825
the Sheriff's Department
has confirmed...

21:06.866 --> 21:08.857
that there is one victim...

21:08.901 --> 21:10.163
Hey, turn that up, man.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.262
Remain sketchy,
but the sheriff--

21:12.305 --> 21:14.830
Sorry, Will.
You know the rules.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.898
Turn that back on.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.206
I know somebody
that lives in that house.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.109
Come on, turn it back on, man!

21:20.146 --> 21:21.443
I never ask for anything.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.006
Just turn on
the fucking TV, please!

21:27.653 --> 21:28.620
Fuck you, man!

21:28.654 --> 21:30.815
What the fuck is your problem?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.051
What are you doing, man?

21:32.091 --> 21:34.423
You want 10ccs of that pink
tranquilizer in your ass?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.052
That was Lori's house.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.995
They said something
about a murder.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.122
I gotta go to her.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.792
I gotta see if she's OK.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.892
Back to Springwood?

21:42.935 --> 21:45.199
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

21:45.238 --> 21:47.206
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.869
OK? You know that's all
just in your head.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.277
Yeah, yeah, and who are you,
the poster boy for sanity?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.302
You're the one
that told the cops...

21:55.348 --> 21:56.940
Lori's dad killed his wife.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.541
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else...

21:58.584 --> 21:59.710
got killed in the same house.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.276
You think that's
a coincidence?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.845
Two murders in one house?

22:03.890 --> 22:07.291
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.021
I don't do checkers.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.052
I'm an UNO guy, all right?

22:11.097 --> 22:15.033
So go grab the fucking UNO deck
and we'll play, OK?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.466
Please. Thank you.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.134
Look at us, Will.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.199
Look around you, man.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.234
We're institutionalized.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.941
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.019
I do miss my family, man.

22:42.061 --> 22:48.057
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen 'em, you know.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.000
All these years,
and you're still convinced...

22:50.036 --> 22:51.401
you saw her father do that?

22:51.437 --> 22:53.234
I know what I saw, Mark.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.400
Fuck what the doctors try
to get me to believe.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.433
I need to know if she's OK.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.388
You want to play?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.737
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.779
What the hell
was that for, man?

23:40.886 --> 23:42.615
Heh heh heh!

23:46.158 --> 23:48.490
You're a fucking lunatic,
you know that?

23:48.527 --> 23:51.052
I know you are,
but what am l?

24:07.647 --> 24:09.274
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

24:09.315 --> 24:12.409
No, Dad, none of us did.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.386
I already went over this
with the police.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.653
It's just...

24:24.697 --> 24:26.631
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.190
You're all I have left.

24:29.368 --> 24:32.030
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.707
I promise.

24:35.741 --> 24:38.039
Look at you.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.339
You're exhausted.

24:39.378 --> 24:42.074
Lori.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.241
We need to get you to bed!

24:47.053 --> 24:49.112
I don't want to
go to sleep, Dad.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.679
I just want to see my friends.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.521
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.584
You've just been through
a very traumatic experience.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.926
Dad, please...

24:57.963 --> 25:00.488
I just need to get
out of the house, OK?

25:00.533 --> 25:03.866
I'll be fine.
I promise.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.044
Well, at least drink your juice.

25:18.484 --> 25:19.883
Will Rollins
and the Davis boy...

25:19.919 --> 25:21.819
escaped from Westin Hills
last night.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.118
Oh, Jesus.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.420
It's all coming apart again.

25:26.459 --> 25:29.087
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.187
Keep this thing contained.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.604
Lori!

25:44.643 --> 25:47.976
Oh, my God! God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.878
Blake's dead, too.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.042
What?

25:52.084 --> 25:54.382
Yeah, he--

25:56.088 --> 26:00.047
He was stabbed
to death late last night.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.219
Same with his dad.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.990
What?

26:06.031 --> 26:09.000
Shit, shit!
This is bullshit!

26:09.034 --> 26:10.558
The police are blaming
everything on Blake...

26:10.603 --> 26:12.628
Iike its some kind
of Columbine thing or something.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.434
They're saying he went crazy.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.499
Killed Trey, killed his dad,
and then took his own life?

26:17.543 --> 26:19.773
This is so fucking messed up.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.336
This is messed up.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.181
Excuse me. Sorry.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.706
Lori?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.218
What is it, Linderman?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.720
Um, well, I heard
what happened,

26:28.754 --> 26:30.619
and I just wanted to
express how, um...

26:30.656 --> 26:33.250
well, to tell you
how sorry I was.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.556
Thank you.
That's sweet.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.495
Right. Actually if you need
anybody to talk to or maybe--

26:38.531 --> 26:40.692
Whoa, Linderman,
let me give you a tip.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.667
Place your hormones
back in the box...

26:42.701 --> 26:44.293
and quit while
you're ahead, OK?

26:44.336 --> 26:46.167
We don't have time
for Date-a-Dork right now.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.365
Thanks.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.370
Right. Sorry.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.309
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.902
He's like one of those
fucking froufrou dogs...

26:53.946 --> 26:55.379
that keeps humping your leg.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.548
Give a couple to some ladies.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.846
Thanks, man.

26:59.885 --> 27:00.852
I see what
you're saying, Gibb...

27:00.886 --> 27:01.910
but that's exactly
why you should go.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.683
I mean, be amongst friends,
where it's safe.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.019
There's gonna be a whole lot
of loving there for you...

27:05.057 --> 27:07.218
and my boy Trey, all right?

27:07.259 --> 27:08.954
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I should go.

27:08.994 --> 27:10.791
I could use a few dozen drinks.

27:10.830 --> 27:11.797
That a girl.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.628
Let your freak flag fly.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.258
See you there.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.290
You want to go?

27:16.335 --> 27:18.235
No, I don't think so.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.738
I--I didn't get much
sleep last night...

27:20.773 --> 27:22.240
and when I did sleep...

27:22.274 --> 27:23.901
I had the most
terrible nightmares.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.104
Lori, you had to sleep
at a police station.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.510
I'd have nightmares, too.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.070
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.048
I mean, this was really real.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.710
I mean, there was this man...

27:32.751 --> 27:34.776
but he more like
a monster really...

27:34.820 --> 27:36.185
and they kept
calling him Freddy...

27:36.222 --> 27:38.019
-and he was so real.
-Shh!

27:38.057 --> 27:39.422
What did he look like?

27:39.458 --> 27:42.256
He--he had this...

27:42.294 --> 27:44.125
dark brown hat, and...

27:44.163 --> 27:46.563
his skin was
terribly burnt...

27:46.599 --> 27:48.931
and on this right hand
he had this like these...

27:48.968 --> 27:50.458
razor fingers, and--

27:50.502 --> 27:51.799
You must be tripping.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.997
No, no, no!

27:53.038 --> 27:54.437
And then there were
these little girls...

27:54.473 --> 27:56.270
It's OK.
It was a bad dream.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.640
They were singing like
this--this song like--

27:58.677 --> 28:03.808
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.942
You know why they sing that?

28:05.985 --> 28:08.545
Because that's when
he comes for you...

28:08.587 --> 28:10.555
in your dreams.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.750
You're lucky to be alive.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.019
Who is he?

28:14.059 --> 28:15.617
He's a child murderer...

28:15.661 --> 28:17.720
that some parents
from around here burned alive...

28:17.763 --> 28:20.027
but then he came back.

28:20.065 --> 28:23.398
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.096
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.365
-OK, thank you!
-No!

28:26.405 --> 28:27.497
You want some free advice?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.370
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.966
Mark!

28:31.010 --> 28:32.170
That's enough.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.236
You're scaring her.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.446
Will?

28:41.487 --> 28:43.648
Hey.

28:47.259 --> 28:50.251
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

28:50.296 --> 28:51.786
Lori! Oh, my God!

28:51.830 --> 28:52.956
Lori, honey, wake up!

28:52.998 --> 28:55.466
Someone get help, please!

28:55.501 --> 28:57.093
Someone get some help, please!

28:57.136 --> 29:01.129
The principal!
Will, let's go, let's go!

29:01.173 --> 29:02.936
Please, somebody help her.
Lori?

29:11.383 --> 29:13.783
How much longer
is it gonna take?

29:13.819 --> 29:15.446
-ls she OK or what?
-Shh!

29:15.487 --> 29:17.284
Tsk!

29:40.512 --> 29:43.345
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia...

29:43.382 --> 29:45.009
do the doctors use?

29:45.050 --> 29:46.711
They put you
all the way under, right?

30:01.533 --> 30:02.830
Got your nose!

30:09.908 --> 30:11.500
Strong work, man.

30:11.543 --> 30:12.669
I came to make sure she's OK...

30:12.711 --> 30:15.043
and you put her
in the infirmary.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.174
What were you
thinking about...

30:20.219 --> 30:21.982
telling her
all that stuff, man?

30:22.021 --> 30:23.249
I mean, we're not in group.

30:23.288 --> 30:24.448
Because I'm thinking
for the first time in my life...

30:24.490 --> 30:26.390
that maybe I'm not crazy...

30:26.425 --> 30:27.915
that my brother wasn't crazy.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.928
She had the same dream, Will.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.930
Will Rollins!
Mark Davis!

30:42.341 --> 30:43.774
This doesn't make any sense.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.208
There's nothing on Krueger.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.270
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

30:48.313 --> 30:51.043
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.382
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.090
January eighteenth.

31:04.129 --> 31:07.428
That's the day my brother
committed suicide.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.457
Why isn't that in here?

31:11.437 --> 31:14.167
I don't know!

31:14.206 --> 31:16.538
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.500
Remember in group
when they told us...

31:19.545 --> 31:20.910
not to jump to conclusions?

31:20.946 --> 31:22.106
Listen to yourself.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.978
You're holding onto
that psychobabble bullshit...

31:24.016 --> 31:26.576
Iike it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.247
Let it go.
They've covered him up, Will.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.722
They never told us
about Freddy...

31:31.757 --> 31:33.657
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.593
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease...

31:36.628 --> 31:37.652
and they locked up
all the kids...

31:37.696 --> 31:38.663
who had made
contact with him...

31:38.697 --> 31:40.426
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

31:40.466 --> 31:41.660
That's crazy.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.168
Is it?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.467
How come we were
never allowed...

31:46.505 --> 31:48.973
to call any of
our friends, man?

31:49.007 --> 31:51.407
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

31:51.443 --> 31:54.469
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.981
That's what
Westin Hills was for.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.381
Well, even if all
you're saying is true...

31:59.418 --> 32:01.818
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

32:01.854 --> 32:04.414
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.084
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.457
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell...

32:08.494 --> 32:10.985
spread enough fear
today at school.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.020
Holy shit.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.631
You're right.

32:18.670 --> 32:22.834
They wanted to forget Freddy so
they wouldn't fear him.

32:22.875 --> 32:25.469
What if I screwed up
the town's plan?

32:26.745 --> 32:29.543
Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man!

32:29.581 --> 32:32.812
Kids are gonna start
falling asleep, it's gonna--

32:32.851 --> 32:34.284
Let's leave, man.
Let's leave right now.

32:34.319 --> 32:35.286
No, I can't leave.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.480
Why not?

32:36.522 --> 32:38.456
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's OK.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.787
Well, is she worth dying for?

32:39.825 --> 32:42.350
Because if you fall asleep,
you ain't waking up.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.693
If that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

32:45.731 --> 32:46.925
Or any of the freaks at Westin?

32:46.965 --> 32:50.196
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

32:50.235 --> 32:51.725
I don't know.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.704
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.266
Look, just give me
one night, OK?

32:58.310 --> 33:01.245
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.739
I swear.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.076
All right.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.916
If your ass isn't back here by
dawn, I'm gone.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.980
We clear on that?

33:12.024 --> 33:15.858
This baby's my brother's
pride and joy, so be careful.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.584
Oh, shit.

33:49.628 --> 33:50.617
Linderman!

33:50.662 --> 33:53.722
Shack, I don't drink.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.578
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.317
Can I get you
something to drink?

34:18.357 --> 34:21.985
Smooth opening, but, you know,
we're already taken care of.

34:22.027 --> 34:24.359
What happened
to your clothes?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.489
Oh, this.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.623
I was playing
a drinking game...

34:27.666 --> 34:30.998
with some
of the lower primates...

34:31.036 --> 34:32.525
and I guess I'm penalized
for my ability...

34:32.571 --> 34:34.197
to read above
a fourth-grade level.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.967
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you...

34:36.007 --> 34:38.498
as a straight up bedwetter.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.511
You know what, Kia?

34:40.545 --> 34:42.012
I used to think you hated me...

34:42.047 --> 34:43.775
because you thought
I wasn't good enough for Lori...

34:43.815 --> 34:45.077
but that's not it.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.347
You tear me down
to make yourself feel better...

34:47.386 --> 34:48.784
because you really
hate yourself...

34:48.820 --> 34:50.514
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually...

34:50.554 --> 34:51.715
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course...

34:51.757 --> 34:53.588
you can think
with all that makeup...

34:53.625 --> 34:55.650
weighing down your head.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.624
The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.227
Apparently,
it was grief over Trey.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.498
No, man, that's bullshit.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.506
I heard some guy Krueger
killed them both.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.508
Said his name to my parents,
they almost shit themselves.

35:10.542 --> 35:11.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
and I heard...

35:11.543 --> 35:13.010
that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

35:13.045 --> 35:15.479
Fucking gutted Trey like
a Goddamn turkey, man.

35:15.514 --> 35:19.450
Like I heard his intestines and
shit was on the floor--

35:19.484 --> 35:22.647
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.384
Oh, my God.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.020
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

35:39.538 --> 35:41.563
What are you looking at?

35:41.606 --> 35:43.904
Come on, come on, let's dance.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.376
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.402
Where have you been, Will?

35:48.447 --> 35:50.176
Didn't you get my letters?

35:50.215 --> 35:51.580
What letters?

35:51.616 --> 35:54.585
They must've never
even mailed them.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.588
Who?

35:57.622 --> 36:01.888
The...doctors at Westin Hills.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.358
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.865
Mark was with me there.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.663
Some other kids, too.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.693
I don't understand.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.667
Well, I saw on the news
the other night...

36:16.708 --> 36:18.801
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.608
I mean, I needed to know
that you were safe.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.238
What happened?

36:23.281 --> 36:24.771
I don't know.
I don't know.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.681
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened...

36:26.718 --> 36:28.185
and the police have been
acting really weird...

36:28.220 --> 36:29.653
Iike they know something...

36:29.688 --> 36:31.849
and I heard them
mention some name.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.619
Some...

36:33.658 --> 36:36.058
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.959
Where was your dad?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.429
Out of town.

36:39.464 --> 36:40.761
Are you sure?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.391
What is going on, Will?

36:42.434 --> 36:44.095
Well, look, four years ago,
I thought l--

36:44.136 --> 36:45.296
Enough with
this bullshit talk.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.305
Let's go shake our ass
on the dance floor.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.636
Come on!

37:07.159 --> 37:09.059
I'm dead one day...

37:09.094 --> 37:11.119
and you're already out
getting shit-faced?

37:11.163 --> 37:12.289
Same old Gibb!

37:12.330 --> 37:16.960
Trey, l--
I can't believe it.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.731
Come on, let's go.

37:20.806 --> 37:24.333
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

37:26.044 --> 37:27.841
Now!

37:37.789 --> 37:39.757
Trey?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.405
No!

38:30.442 --> 38:32.273
Open the door!

38:32.310 --> 38:34.141
Please, the door--

39:18.290 --> 39:20.281
No! No!

39:43.348 --> 39:45.043
You're the one
that killed Trey!

39:45.083 --> 39:49.747
Oh, don't worry about
my little errand boy.

39:49.788 --> 39:54.487
The only to fear
is fear himself!

41:21.746 --> 41:24.078
No!

41:25.750 --> 41:27.274
She's mine.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.651
Mine! Mine!

41:37.595 --> 41:41.190
This everclear
is kicking my ass.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.256
This--

41:55.714 --> 41:58.239
Check out this fucking guy.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.511
Well, hey, Jethro!

41:59.551 --> 42:02.577
This is a rave,
not a Halloween party.

42:02.620 --> 42:06.522
Why don't you go
find yourself a pig to fuck?

42:06.558 --> 42:08.116
Yeah!

42:08.159 --> 42:11.560
Invite only, cornpoke,
and you weren't invite--

42:11.596 --> 42:13.655
Son of a bitch.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.900
Yeah!

42:24.943 --> 42:27.776
Burn, motherfucker!

42:46.464 --> 42:48.659
No!

43:16.861 --> 43:17.850
Run, man, run!

43:29.374 --> 43:32.434
Freak!
You killed my brother!

43:45.957 --> 43:48.289
Gibb! Oh, my God!

43:48.326 --> 43:50.191
Oh, Gibb! No!

43:50.228 --> 43:51.695
Let's go!
Let's go, come on!

43:58.336 --> 44:00.463
Was that him?

44:00.505 --> 44:02.735
The guy you were talking about--
Freddy Krueger.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.503
No, that wasn't
the guy in my dream.

44:04.542 --> 44:05.566
That was somebody else!

44:05.610 --> 44:08.511
Who cares about some
fucking dream guy, OK?

44:08.546 --> 44:10.411
That psycho
in the hockey mask was real.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.746
Dude, that goalie was
pissed about something.

44:12.784 --> 44:13.944
We need to find the police.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.283
No, no! Fuck the police!

44:16.321 --> 44:17.845
Just take me home, Will.

44:27.599 --> 44:30.090
Gibb, l--

44:30.134 --> 44:31.601
I can't believe she...

44:31.636 --> 44:32.796
I know.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.368
Look, call me later, OK?
Please.

44:40.411 --> 44:41.935
Just to check in.

44:48.786 --> 44:49.753
Bye, Will.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.221
Be careful.

45:11.109 --> 45:12.576
Will, I'm gonna go inside now.

45:12.610 --> 45:15.545
I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

45:15.580 --> 45:17.343
Oh, Will, please.

45:17.382 --> 45:18.474
After everything
that's happened...

45:18.516 --> 45:19.483
I just want to go to--

45:19.517 --> 45:22.247
There's more
to it than that.

45:22.287 --> 45:25.814
Look, I tried to tell
you this earlier.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.449
The reason
I was sent to Westin...

45:27.492 --> 45:31.929
is because I saw
your dad kill your mom.

45:33.097 --> 45:35.622
Will, my mom died
in a car accident.

45:35.667 --> 45:38.067
No, that's what he
wanted you to believe...

45:38.102 --> 45:39.296
but I was there, Lori.

45:39.337 --> 45:42.602
I was sneaking up to your room,
like I used to do.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.471
Only you weren't there.

45:47.145 --> 45:49.511
I saw him kill her.

45:51.316 --> 45:52.283
Dad!

45:52.317 --> 45:53.750
Get out of the van.

45:53.785 --> 45:55.412
Get out of the van!
Where were you?

45:55.453 --> 45:56.420
What are you doing?

45:56.454 --> 45:57.853
I've been looking
all over for you!

45:57.889 --> 45:59.049
Get away from her!

45:59.090 --> 46:00.421
You're in a helluva
lot of trouble, you know that?

46:00.458 --> 46:02.016
Like I give
a shit anymore.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.254
Get in the house!

46:03.294 --> 46:04.556
You! I'm taking you
back to Westin.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.586
No! No way!
You can't trust him, Lori.

46:06.631 --> 46:08.428
Whatever you do,
don't go home with him!

46:08.466 --> 46:10.093
No, listen to me!

46:10.134 --> 46:12.068
He was the one
who had me committed!

46:12.103 --> 46:13.627
You didn't understand.

46:13.671 --> 46:15.161
You still don't.
You were confused!

46:15.206 --> 46:16.173
Stop it!

46:16.207 --> 46:17.799
Both of you, stop it!

46:17.842 --> 46:19.434
Damn it, Will!
I am not gonna let you...

46:19.477 --> 46:21.342
endanger my daughter again!

46:21.379 --> 46:23.609
Not after everything
that's happened!

46:23.648 --> 46:25.946
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

46:25.984 --> 46:28.384
Lori!

46:34.025 --> 46:36.653
I--l--

46:36.694 --> 46:38.628
Did Mom die
in a car accident?

46:38.663 --> 46:40.824
Yes. Of course she did.

46:40.865 --> 46:42.332
Prove it.

46:42.367 --> 46:43.994
Show me a death certificate.

46:44.035 --> 46:46.367
Show me an autopsy report.

46:46.404 --> 46:48.998
Lori, I don't think now
is the right time--

46:49.040 --> 46:50.007
Really, Dad?

46:50.041 --> 46:51.804
Because I think
it's a perfect time!

46:51.843 --> 46:53.504
Why didn't you tell me
about Westin Hills?

46:53.544 --> 46:55.011
Do you work there?

46:55.046 --> 46:57.207
Because I thought you were
a fucking general practitioner!

46:57.248 --> 46:59.216
Yes, l...

46:59.250 --> 47:01.741
I do some consulting
there now, but...

47:01.786 --> 47:03.515
it's--it isn't
what you think.

47:03.554 --> 47:07.115
Oh, my God.

47:07.158 --> 47:10.059
So you knew about Will
this whole time.

47:10.094 --> 47:13.655
Lori, listen to me.

47:13.698 --> 47:17.896
You're upset.
We both are.

47:17.935 --> 47:19.903
Now I think what you need now...

47:19.937 --> 47:23.202
more than anything
is to get some rest.

47:23.241 --> 47:24.902
Why don't I give you
some pills...

47:24.942 --> 47:26.603
and that'll help you sleep...

47:26.644 --> 47:29.135
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

47:29.180 --> 47:31.011
I don't want
to sleep, Dad!

47:31.049 --> 47:33.142
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

47:33.184 --> 47:34.242
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

47:34.285 --> 47:36.014
Now do what I say!

47:36.054 --> 47:37.487
Lori! Lori!

47:42.026 --> 47:44.290
Open this door.
Open this door!

47:44.328 --> 47:45.727
Go away!

47:45.763 --> 47:46.730
Damn it, Lori!

47:46.764 --> 47:48.391
Let me in!

47:54.439 --> 47:55.565
Goddamn it!

48:17.929 --> 48:20.454
It's OK, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

48:20.498 --> 48:22.625
You OK? Are you OK?

48:22.667 --> 48:24.794
It's me, all right?

48:24.836 --> 48:29.671
I don't know how your father's
connected to all this...

48:29.707 --> 48:30.969
but I think
Mark was right.

48:31.008 --> 48:33.841
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

48:35.847 --> 48:38.145
We can't trust the police.

48:39.817 --> 48:41.512
We can't trust
any of the adults.

48:43.888 --> 48:45.321
So what do we do?

48:45.356 --> 48:47.119
We gotta get to Mark.

48:47.391 --> 48:49.052
He's the expert in all of this.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.082
He'll know what's going on.

49:00.571 --> 49:05.270
You always looked out
for me, bro.

49:06.410 --> 49:08.708
Hey, Mark.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.513
I gotta stay awake.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.262
Shit!

50:16.185 --> 50:18.210
Hey, Mark.

50:18.254 --> 50:19.812
You didn't forget
about me, did you?

50:19.855 --> 50:21.220
Oh, God.

50:21.257 --> 50:23.282
Oh, that's right!

50:23.326 --> 50:24.657
Everyone forgot!

50:24.694 --> 50:27.128
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

50:27.163 --> 50:28.653
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me...

50:28.698 --> 50:30.791
to get them to remember.

50:30.833 --> 50:36.100
But now he just won't stop,
that hockey puck!

50:43.779 --> 50:47.271
This isn't...real.

50:49.652 --> 50:53.281
Somebody, please, wake me up!

50:53.322 --> 50:54.619
Please!

51:05.468 --> 51:08.266
Mark! Mark, wake up!

51:08.304 --> 51:11.137
I need you to send
a little message for me.

51:11.173 --> 51:14.506
That's all,
just a little message.

51:14.543 --> 51:16.443
I'm not gonna do it.

51:16.479 --> 51:18.106
I won't do it!

51:18.147 --> 51:20.672
No?!

51:20.716 --> 51:23.617
I won't do it.

51:32.028 --> 51:37.864
I'll have to pass that message
myself, won't l?

51:43.072 --> 51:44.835
Oh, my God!

51:48.377 --> 51:52.313
Let go of me!

51:52.348 --> 51:53.906
Help...me.

51:53.949 --> 51:55.576
Mark!

52:06.095 --> 52:10.361
Pass on a little
message for me, will ya?

52:21.844 --> 52:24.813
Sheriff,
I've been compiling info...

52:24.847 --> 52:26.781
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

52:26.816 --> 52:28.545
We already know who did this.

52:28.584 --> 52:30.575
Sheriff, we closed
down the school...

52:30.619 --> 52:32.382
and set up a curfew
for anyone under eighteen.

52:32.421 --> 52:33.513
Good.

52:33.556 --> 52:35.319
Now I want twenty-four-hour
roadblocks set up.

52:35.357 --> 52:36.949
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

52:36.992 --> 52:38.516
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch...

52:38.561 --> 52:39.755
before he spreads any further.

52:39.795 --> 52:41.990
Yes, sir.

52:42.031 --> 52:43.931
Sir, shouldn't we have
the F.B.I. come in and--

52:43.966 --> 52:46.127
No outsiders, Stubbs.

52:46.168 --> 52:48.636
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

52:48.671 --> 52:50.901
OK, I'm a little lost here.

52:50.940 --> 52:52.339
Stopped who before?

52:52.374 --> 52:55.571
We don't say his name out loud.

52:55.611 --> 52:57.545
You're not from around here.

52:57.580 --> 52:58.547
I don't expect you
to understand.

52:58.581 --> 53:00.640
With all due resect, Sheriff...

53:00.683 --> 53:03.277
I think we have a copycat
of the old Jason Voorhees...

53:03.319 --> 53:04.684
Crystal Lake killer
on our hands--

53:04.720 --> 53:06.017
You listen to me.

53:06.055 --> 53:08.489
We do things around here
a certain way for a reason...

53:08.524 --> 53:10.890
and that's given us
four years of peace.

53:10.926 --> 53:12.985
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

53:13.028 --> 53:15.223
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

53:15.264 --> 53:17.596
Do you understand me?!

53:20.636 --> 53:21.796
Yes, sir.

53:32.515 --> 53:34.380
Why don't we all just leave?

53:34.416 --> 53:39.149
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

53:39.188 --> 53:42.624
We all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

53:44.393 --> 53:49.092
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

53:49.131 --> 53:51.725
We're marked now.

53:51.767 --> 53:53.564
Man, screw that clown.

53:53.602 --> 53:55.069
I mean, what kind
of a pussy...

53:55.104 --> 53:56.765
comes after you
in your dreams anyway?

53:56.806 --> 53:59.832
Now, that big-ass mother fucker
back at the cornfield...

53:59.875 --> 54:02.036
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

54:02.077 --> 54:04.272
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

54:04.313 --> 54:06.713
His name was Jason Voorhees.

54:06.749 --> 54:09.980
Shit, man...um...

54:10.019 --> 54:12.954
How'd you know
we were here?

54:12.988 --> 54:15.218
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back...

54:15.257 --> 54:17.054
wasn't exactly subtle.

54:17.092 --> 54:19.424
And never keep
your keys in the door.

54:19.461 --> 54:21.725
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

54:21.764 --> 54:23.629
No, you're not.

54:23.666 --> 54:26.191
I'm here to help you.

54:26.235 --> 54:29.033
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

54:29.071 --> 54:31.562
at Camp Crystal Lake
back in 1957...

54:31.607 --> 54:33.336
when he was
eleven years old.

54:33.375 --> 54:36.173
The counselors weren't
watching him...

54:36.212 --> 54:39.010
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

54:39.048 --> 54:41.175
The legend has it...

54:41.217 --> 54:43.708
that Jason kept returning
from his grave...

54:43.752 --> 54:45.583
to punish whoever
returned to the camp.

54:45.621 --> 54:48.522
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

54:48.557 --> 54:50.149
No. No. No, no, no.

54:50.192 --> 54:51.682
He's not a copycat.

54:51.727 --> 54:53.354
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

54:53.395 --> 54:55.693
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

54:55.731 --> 54:58.859
You'd better start thinking
outside your little box, dude...

54:58.901 --> 55:00.562
'cause somebody's
definitely breaking...

55:00.603 --> 55:02.628
the fucking reality rules, OK?

55:02.671 --> 55:04.036
It makes sense in a way.

55:04.073 --> 55:07.600
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back...

55:07.643 --> 55:09.907
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own...

55:09.945 --> 55:12.505
so he used Jason.

55:12.548 --> 55:14.607
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him...

55:14.650 --> 55:16.174
that we'd spread
the fear again.

55:16.218 --> 55:17.412
And now that it's working...

55:17.453 --> 55:20.013
it's like he can't
shut Jason back down.

55:20.055 --> 55:21.682
Wait a minute.

55:21.724 --> 55:24.750
Freddy died by fire,
Jason by water.

55:24.793 --> 55:26.852
How can we use that?

55:26.896 --> 55:29.694
I think we should
concentrate on Jason first.

55:29.732 --> 55:31.427
But I thought we decided...

55:31.467 --> 55:33.162
that Freddy was the one
pulling the strings.

55:33.202 --> 55:35.636
Shouldn't we go
after him first?

55:35.671 --> 55:38.299
I don't know, maybe
what we need to do is...

55:38.340 --> 55:40.934
to offer Freddy
a sacrifice.

55:40.976 --> 55:42.534
Yeah, yeah, totally.

55:42.578 --> 55:45.809
Like a virgin, right?
Someone pure.

55:51.220 --> 55:53.620
Dude, don't look at me.

55:53.656 --> 55:56.124
Even if you pay for it,
it still counts.

55:56.158 --> 55:58.217
Oh, come on.

55:58.260 --> 56:01.058
Look, we all know who
the real virgin is here.

56:01.096 --> 56:03.758
-Kia!
-Oh, come on, Lori.

56:03.799 --> 56:05.596
I know you never
made it with Will.

56:05.634 --> 56:10.435
Why would he want to when
he can fuck somebody like me?

56:15.878 --> 56:17.470
Let's tie the bitch up.

56:20.449 --> 56:22.440
What?

56:24.887 --> 56:27.253
Don't worry, angel.

56:27.289 --> 56:28.950
You've still got me.

56:28.991 --> 56:31.459
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

56:36.165 --> 56:39.828
Your eyes say no-no...

56:39.868 --> 56:44.305
but my mouth says yes-yes.

56:48.744 --> 56:50.371
Lori, are you all right?

56:50.412 --> 56:51.572
You fell asleep.

56:59.688 --> 57:01.781
Oh, shit!

57:05.627 --> 57:07.618
I pulled that out of my dream.

57:07.663 --> 57:09.654
How is that possible?

57:09.698 --> 57:11.723
Anything is possible now!

57:11.767 --> 57:13.029
God, you just don't get it!

57:13.068 --> 57:15.195
Oh, God, y'all, two killers?

57:15.237 --> 57:17.137
We're not safe awake or asleep.

57:17.172 --> 57:19.003
It's not the sleep
that's killing us...

57:19.041 --> 57:20.008
it's our dreams.

57:20.042 --> 57:22.704
At Westin, Mark and l
never had dreams.

57:22.745 --> 57:25.475
Were you on any drugs?

57:25.514 --> 57:27.914
Yeah, but there's
something called hypnocil.

57:27.950 --> 57:30.009
They never told us
what it was for...

57:30.052 --> 57:32.077
but everyone there
was taking it.

57:34.189 --> 57:36.817
Experimental drug...

57:36.859 --> 57:38.417
not even approved yet
by the F.D.A.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.257
Oh, shit.

57:40.295 --> 57:44.197
Used for...
suppression of dreams.

57:44.233 --> 57:47.725
We need those pills,
enough for all of us.

57:47.770 --> 57:49.897
Can you get us
back to Westin Hills?

58:10.225 --> 58:11.817
All right,
this isn't it, guys.

58:11.860 --> 58:13.691
Come on, let's go.

58:13.729 --> 58:14.696
Hey, dude.

58:14.730 --> 58:16.061
Let's take a little
J-break, huh?

58:16.098 --> 58:18.760
No, man. He's a cop.

58:18.801 --> 58:21.292
Come on. What's he
gonna do, arrest me?

58:21.336 --> 58:23.668
Hold up.
Hang on a second.

58:23.705 --> 58:25.070
Fuck.

58:34.083 --> 58:35.880
That's better.

58:51.133 --> 58:53.294
Where's Freeburg?

58:53.335 --> 58:54.324
Come on. Come on!

59:12.121 --> 59:13.281
This is "D" wing.

59:13.322 --> 59:16.018
These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

59:24.066 --> 59:25.294
Are they dead?

59:28.670 --> 59:31.639
They're in a coma.

59:31.673 --> 59:34.471
It says they were given
too much hypnocil.

59:35.844 --> 59:37.709
Who would do this to people?

59:37.746 --> 59:40.374
Your dad's name
is at the bottom...

59:40.415 --> 59:41.973
of both of these charts.

59:50.092 --> 59:52.458
Cool...yeah.

01:00:02.437 --> 01:00:05.065
What the fuck?

01:00:18.854 --> 01:00:20.253
Nice.

01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:29.760
Oh, yeah.

01:00:34.203 --> 01:00:35.898
Hold up, man.

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:48.940
What?

01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:56.117
What do you want?

01:00:59.294 --> 01:01:02.923
No, I don't know where
the hypnocil is, OK?

01:01:13.976 --> 01:01:15.341
I can't pour these
down the drain.

01:01:15.377 --> 01:01:16.810
We need this stuff.

01:01:33.629 --> 01:01:34.994
Freeburg!

01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:37.966
Freeburg!

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.262
What are you doing?

01:01:39.301 --> 01:01:40.427
We need those drugs!

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:42.698
Dude, no! Dude--

01:01:49.678 --> 01:01:51.305
Go on! Get out of here!

01:01:51.346 --> 01:01:53.007
Go!

01:02:08.697 --> 01:02:10.130
What was that?

01:02:13.435 --> 01:02:14.959
Let's go check it out.
Let's go.

01:02:16.238 --> 01:02:20.436
Get back! Shit! Hell!

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.999
Fucker!

01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:23.443
Help me!

01:02:40.529 --> 01:02:41.826
Shit! They're all empty!

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:42.830
We gotta keep looking.

01:02:42.864 --> 01:02:44.229
Maybe there's some down here.

01:02:44.266 --> 01:02:46.257
Damn, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:57.970
Freeburg, come on!

01:02:58.013 --> 01:02:59.913
Come on! Come on!

01:02:59.948 --> 01:03:02.178
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:04.344
Freeburg, time to go.

01:03:04.386 --> 01:03:06.684
We gotta go!
Now! come on!

01:03:06.722 --> 01:03:09.384
Let me handle this, bitch.

01:03:09.424 --> 01:03:11.085
What?

01:03:12.627 --> 01:03:14.424
Come on, come on!
OK, let's go!

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:17.162
Let's go.

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:18.291
No, wait, wait!

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.322
Look.

01:03:22.971 --> 01:03:24.563
Come to Freddy.

01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:28.574
These are my children, Jason.

01:03:28.977 --> 01:03:31.468
Go back where you belong!

01:03:42.157 --> 01:03:44.352
Fuck you!

01:03:46.128 --> 01:03:48.062
Linderman...

01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:53.298
These are my children, Jason.

01:03:53.335 --> 01:03:55.803
Go back where you belong.

01:04:08.116 --> 01:04:11.950
Jason...Jason.

01:04:11.987 --> 01:04:15.320
My special, special boy.

01:04:19.694 --> 01:04:22.060
I'm disappointed
in you, Jason.

01:04:22.097 --> 01:04:23.997
You disobeyed me.

01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:25.727
You were supposed
to come back home...

01:04:25.767 --> 01:04:27.530
just kill a few of them!

01:04:27.569 --> 01:04:29.764
But I blame myself.
I should've known...

01:04:29.805 --> 01:04:31.932
you wouldn't be able
to stop killing!

01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:37.138
You are like a big, stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

01:04:37.179 --> 01:04:41.616
even though your master
said you've had enough!

01:04:47.722 --> 01:04:52.159
Now it's time to put
this bad dog to sleep...

01:04:54.563 --> 01:04:55.689
for good!

01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:04.463
Not my arm!

01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:33.067
Welcome to my nightmare.

01:05:53.154 --> 01:05:55.384
Penny for your thoughts, chief!

01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:59.386
Oh, scary.

01:06:19.247 --> 01:06:20.509
Tilt.

01:06:44.205 --> 01:06:46.400
Why won't you die?

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.159
Come on. Come on!

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.749
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

01:07:46.034 --> 01:07:48.662
How in the fuck did I let y'all
talk me into this?

01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:50.796
Why don't we just
try and do it here?

01:07:50.839 --> 01:07:52.830
Why go all the way
to Crystal Lake?

01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:54.933
Best-case scenario: Jason wins.

01:07:54.976 --> 01:07:57.740
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

01:07:57.779 --> 01:07:58.973
I mean, why follow us anymore?

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:00.675
And if Freddy wins?

01:08:00.715 --> 01:08:03.707
At least Jason
has home-field advantage.

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:32.210
Aww...how sweet.

01:08:33.348 --> 01:08:35.509
You ugly little shit.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:40.385
Now there's a face...
only a mother could love!

01:08:42.724 --> 01:08:43.917
Yeah!

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.858
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:08:45.894 --> 01:08:48.522
Let's see
what really scares you.

01:08:55.603 --> 01:08:58.435
And dig a little deeper.

01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:32.573
I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.

01:09:49.424 --> 01:09:51.721
We're seriously running
out of tranq here, guys.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.991
I got maybe one dose,
plus enough for Lori.

01:09:55.029 --> 01:09:56.257
Well, we're almost there.

01:09:56.297 --> 01:09:57.696
Then I better get going.

01:09:57.732 --> 01:09:58.960
No, no, just...

01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:05.336
I don't want you to go.

01:10:05.373 --> 01:10:06.897
I'm coming back.

01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:09.603
Just give me fifteen minutes,
then wake me up.

01:10:09.644 --> 01:10:11.874
I'll bring that bastard
Freddy back through.

01:10:11.913 --> 01:10:14.643
Just make sure
Jason's waiting for him.

01:10:19.287 --> 01:10:22.415
Now I lay me down to sleep.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:48.278
Freak show! Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:10:48.316 --> 01:10:49.806
Bull's-eye!

01:10:53.922 --> 01:10:55.947
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.389
Try this on!

01:10:58.593 --> 01:11:01.687
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.033
Stupid!

01:11:10.338 --> 01:11:12.306
Aren't you gonna help the kid?!

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.865
Can't you see I'm busy here?

01:11:14.909 --> 01:11:16.342
You mean you're not coming?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.545
It's not my fault this bitch
is dead on her feet.

01:11:31.359 --> 01:11:32.951
It's been five minutes.

01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:35.189
Well, that was the last
of the tranq, OK? We're out.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.164
Calm down, OK?
Just relax!

01:11:50.945 --> 01:11:52.879
Heeeeelp!

01:11:52.914 --> 01:11:56.543
Wait! Give me your hand!

01:11:56.584 --> 01:11:59.348
Give me your hand!

01:12:00.855 --> 01:12:01.947
Help!

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:04.254
Jason?

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:06.055
Jason Vorhees?

01:12:16.738 --> 01:12:18.706
Y'all...y'all...

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.764
Y'all, something's wrong.

01:12:19.807 --> 01:12:21.001
It's like he's drowning
or something.

01:12:21.042 --> 01:12:22.407
Freddy must be killing him.

01:12:22.443 --> 01:12:23.410
We need him alive!

01:12:23.444 --> 01:12:24.536
Dude, what do you
want me to do...

01:12:24.579 --> 01:12:27.047
Iike, give him
mouth-to-mouth or something?

01:12:34.789 --> 01:12:36.620
Hell no.
Why are you--

01:12:36.658 --> 01:12:39.126
No! No, I'm not
gonna do that. No!

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.422
Kia, look, I would
do it myself...

01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:42.156
but I've had asthma
since I was six, OK?

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:43.663
I don't have the lung power.

01:12:43.698 --> 01:12:45.131
No.

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:47.498
Kia, he has asthma!

01:12:47.535 --> 01:12:50.060
Ooh! Ooh...

01:12:51.306 --> 01:12:53.001
Look, you can do this, OK?

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:54.167
You can do this.
You just--

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:57.939
Shut up! You're not the one
that has to do this.

01:12:57.979 --> 01:12:58.968
I know, but l--

01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:00.378
Shut up!

01:13:03.451 --> 01:13:05.510
Oh, my God.

01:13:07.455 --> 01:13:09.923
Ohh, God!

01:13:15.163 --> 01:13:16.824
Oh, man.

01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:19.856
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:45.651
You!

01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:01.570
What's wrong, Lori?

01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:03.509
Miss your wake-up call?

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.241
Wake me up!
I got him! I got him!

01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:15.481
No!

01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:16.547
Lori, come on! Wake up!

01:14:16.591 --> 01:14:18.252
Lori, wake up, please!

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.691
Look!

01:14:19.727 --> 01:14:21.217
Guys, look.

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:24.022
We're almost there.

01:14:24.065 --> 01:14:26.863
Help me. Come on.
We gotta get her up.

01:14:28.136 --> 01:14:30.195
Come on. Start running.
Start running.

01:14:30.238 --> 01:14:32.138
Wake me up!

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:35.536
Daddy, don't!

01:15:01.903 --> 01:15:04.428
Daddy!
No, daddy, don't!

01:15:04.472 --> 01:15:06.303
Freddy!
It was you!

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:08.433
I've always had a thing...

01:15:08.476 --> 01:15:11.274
for the whores
that live in this house.

01:15:21.456 --> 01:15:22.480
Lori, wake up!

01:15:25.426 --> 01:15:26.757
Oh, shit.

01:15:31.699 --> 01:15:33.132
It's him. He's here.

01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:34.759
Lori, come on!
You gotta wake up!

01:15:39.507 --> 01:15:41.134
Oh, yes.

01:15:46.214 --> 01:15:48.182
My God!

01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:51.976
Come on, Lori, wake up!

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:53.611
Lori, please. Wake up!

01:15:53.654 --> 01:15:55.246
Lori, please.
Lori, please.

01:16:01.696 --> 01:16:02.720
Go! Go, go, go!

01:16:05.766 --> 01:16:07.063
Lori!

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:14.331
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:15.501
Goddamn it!

01:16:19.547 --> 01:16:22.573
Welcome to my world, bitch.

01:16:24.819 --> 01:16:27.549
I should warn you, princess...

01:16:27.588 --> 01:16:30.182
the first time tends
to get a little...

01:16:31.425 --> 01:16:33.552
messy.

01:16:50.578 --> 01:16:51.567
Get away from her!

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.052
Linderman.

01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:08.423
Oh! Oh, no!

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:18.799
Die, you little bitch.

01:18:13.194 --> 01:18:15.594
Jesus, Linderman.
You--you're really hurt.

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.461
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:18.624
Just a scratch.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:19.792
Just go get help, OK?

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:21.859
What? You don't think--

01:18:21.902 --> 01:18:23.699
Look, I'm just gonna
rest here a minute.

01:18:23.738 --> 01:18:26.036
-Linderman--
-I'm fine, Kia.

01:18:26.073 --> 01:18:27.335
Really.
Now get out of here.

01:18:27.375 --> 01:18:28.899
-Go get help.
-But you--

01:18:28.943 --> 01:18:30.467
Just go.

01:18:31.545 --> 01:18:35.037
OK, but I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

01:19:15.022 --> 01:19:16.284
Lori!

01:19:16.324 --> 01:19:18.656
Think you're so smart,
huh, bitch?

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:21.492
Freddy!

01:19:31.038 --> 01:19:33.131
How sweet...

01:19:33.174 --> 01:19:35.074
dark meat.

01:19:35.109 --> 01:19:37.976
-No! Kia!
-Let's go!

01:19:38.012 --> 01:19:39.479
Nooo!

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:41.845
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

01:19:44.118 --> 01:19:46.143
Tell me something.

01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:47.882
What kind of faggot...

01:19:47.922 --> 01:19:50.550
runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

01:19:51.926 --> 01:19:54.258
I mean, come on. Get real.

01:19:54.295 --> 01:19:55.956
You're not even scary.

01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:57.759
You're not even scary.

01:19:57.798 --> 01:20:01.632
And let's talk about
the butter knives.

01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:03.466
What is with the butter knives?

01:20:03.504 --> 01:20:06.598
You trying to compensate
for something?

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.107
Maybe coming up
a little short there...

01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:11.202
between the legs,
Mr. Krueger?

01:20:11.245 --> 01:20:12.405
Hmm.

01:20:12.446 --> 01:20:15.973
I mean, you got these
teensy-weensy little things...

01:20:16.016 --> 01:20:21.454
and Jason has got this
big ol' thing that's like...

01:20:30.498 --> 01:20:31.487
Kia!

01:20:31.532 --> 01:20:33.432
-No! No!
-Come on!

01:20:38.806 --> 01:20:39.795
Come on, Lori.
Let's go.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.864
We can't help her anymore.

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:42.535
No! I'm staying!

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:45.136
Are you crazy?
You got what you wanted.

01:20:45.179 --> 01:20:47.010
You pulled Freddy out,
and now he's fighting Jason.

01:20:47.047 --> 01:20:48.241
Come on!
What more do you want?

01:20:48.282 --> 01:20:50.147
He killed my mother, Will!

01:20:50.184 --> 01:20:51.549
It was Freddy.

01:20:51.585 --> 01:20:53.917
My dad covered it up
to protect me.

01:20:53.954 --> 01:20:54.921
He didn't do it.

01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:56.479
Look, he has taken
everything from us!

01:20:56.524 --> 01:20:58.856
He has ruined
both of our pasts...

01:20:58.893 --> 01:21:02.260
and I am not leaving
until I see him die!

01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:32.822
Man the torpedoes.

01:21:56.951 --> 01:21:58.578
Hey, asshole!

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.747
Up here!

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:10.159
Aha!

01:22:27.248 --> 01:22:28.613
Yeah.

01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:41.124
Ah, give me a break.

01:23:06.854 --> 01:23:08.287
Oh, no.

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:12.281
Ohh, noooo!

01:24:36.377 --> 01:24:38.311
Lori, get the tanks!

01:24:42.049 --> 01:24:43.311
Give it up!

01:25:10.611 --> 01:25:12.169
Freddy!

01:25:13.781 --> 01:25:15.112
Go to hell!

01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:06.158
It's OK. It's OK.

01:27:37.558 --> 01:27:39.185
You...

01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:13.925
Welcome to my world, bitch!
