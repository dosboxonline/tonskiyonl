WEBVTT

00:45.170 --> 00:49.633
<i>Do you, Boxy, take this air conditioner
to be your lawfully wedded...</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:52.052
<i>You can't go through with it, Boxy.</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.304
<i>For she is your sister.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:57.307
<i>And my sister.</i>

00:58.267 --> 01:00.060
<i>And my wife!</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.188
<i>And my air conditioner!</i>

01:09.194 --> 01:12.114
Oh, there you are. Behold.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.453
What in the name of my ass
is going on here?

01:18.453 --> 01:22.207
The Academy of Inventors'
Annual Competition is approaching.

01:22.207 --> 01:26.587
So I've created the world's
most powerful sewing machine.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.798
That is an amazing invention.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.301
This isn't the invention, you boob.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.721
Let me just activate it
using my footnological marvel,

01:35.721 --> 01:37.306
the toelonger.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.141
It's glorious!

01:39.141 --> 01:41.685
That's not the invention, either.
Stop guessing.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.152
The theme of the competition
is recycling.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.071
So I'm attempting to recycle
old human parts

01:53.071 --> 01:56.617
into a new,
environmentally-friendly human.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.535
Hyello, Mr. Professorvich.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.163
Very extremely good catch for you today.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.790
Luckily was big railroad accident.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.585
I'll take a pound and a half of hand.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.802
Wow. Is that a flatlock seam?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.055
Why, thank you for noticing, Amy.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.350
It looks elegant
and minimizes blood loss.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.354
Now, the easy part.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.872
Voilà!

02:44.039 --> 02:47.167
Um, Professor? Most people have a head.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.461
Sure. The in-crowd.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.380
Look, you've come this far.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.716
You don't wanna lose the contest
over a few style points.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.679
Fine. Let's fancy it up with a head.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.849
The head is the part with the teeth
and the sneeze hole, right?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.939
Any of you presidents need a body?

03:08.939 --> 03:10.899
Can it hit a no-look jump shot?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.819
- Uh, sure.
- Then why does it need me?

03:16.655 --> 03:17.781
Good one, Mommy!

03:17.781 --> 03:21.243
Whoa! The Gallery of Supermodels!

03:21.410 --> 03:25.664
Ugh. Okay, but remember:
Their eyes are up here.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.296
Um, do any of you
lovely lady... People...

03:34.464 --> 03:37.467
Which of you indistinguishable
human heads wants a body?

03:37.467 --> 03:38.552
Is it tall?

03:38.552 --> 03:42.181
I miss doing runway shows
and intimidating short people.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.807
The left side's pretty tall.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.934
Trust me, it's attractive.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.854
It's got thick, luxurious hair
all over the place,

03:48.854 --> 03:51.565
and several legs that just won't quit.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.900
And one that will.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.026
I'll do it.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.195
Really?

03:56.195 --> 04:00.282
Of course, dear, it's not the body,
it's how you wear it.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.369
That's Cara Delevingne.
She invented eyebrows.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.752
And finished!

04:12.044 --> 04:14.546
Oh, no, this won't do.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.923
That's the only head we got.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.758
I mean, what I'm wearing.

04:17.758 --> 04:22.596
I'm sorry, Cara. But due to your various
and unusual proportions,

04:22.596 --> 04:25.098
no clothing will ever fit you.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.685
There's just no possible way to...
I've got it!

04:30.938 --> 04:34.566
Simply step into my 3D clothing scanner.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.656
You didn't need that hind leg anyway.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.367
Now, we'll take your exact measurements.

04:45.035 --> 04:49.456
Good Lord!
Encode them in a strand of RNA.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.627
Inject it into
a giant Bolivian silkworm.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.047
Let it spin its cocoon.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.300
And six weeks later, presto!

05:00.300 --> 05:03.470
We have a custom fitted silk garment.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.727
Thanks, but it's a little
Soviet brutalist for me.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.689
That's because you are looking
at the wrong side.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.610
This is spectacular.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.280
I never expected
to love something so much

05:21.280 --> 05:23.156
that was excreted from a moth.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.371
<i>Scientists and scienticians,</i>

05:29.371 --> 05:33.500
<i>I'm proud to present the finalists
for this year's Inventors' Award.</i>

05:33.709 --> 05:36.003
<i>First up, Dr. Bubblegum Tate,</i>

05:36.003 --> 05:39.673
<i>and his postdoctoral fellow,
Sweet Clyde Dixon.</i>

05:41.300 --> 05:45.345
Dr. Dixon and I have devised a way
to generate clean power

05:45.345 --> 05:49.808
from the billions of basketballs
discarded each year by the Big 12.

05:59.902 --> 06:03.739
<i>Next up, last year's winner,
Professor Ogden Wernstrom.</i>

06:03.739 --> 06:05.866
Wernstrom!

06:06.742 --> 06:11.205
Discarded doomsday devices
pose a grave environmental risk.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.333
So I've invented a way
of reprogramming them

06:14.333 --> 06:17.252
into lovable companions for the elderly.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.091
Aww!

06:23.967 --> 06:25.802
Come along, Explodey.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.056
<i>And last up...</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:33.852
<i>...Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth.</i>

06:34.603 --> 06:37.898
<i>Colleagues, you witness history tonight.</i>

06:37.898 --> 06:42.986
<i>The technology to recycle the dead
back to semi-normal life.</i>

06:50.369 --> 06:53.622
<i>It's a scientific leap for humanity.</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:54.706
<i>Questions?</i>

06:54.706 --> 06:57.626
Who made that dress? It's fabulous.

06:57.626 --> 07:01.505
<i>Did you not hear what I said?
I brought a human back to life!</i>

07:01.505 --> 07:04.883
But that gown
brings sexy back to science.

07:05.342 --> 07:09.596
Are there any questions about my
invention and not the damn dress?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.183
<i>And now, to announce the winner.</i>

07:13.183 --> 07:17.396
<i>In the spirit of recycling,
we're reusing last year's envelope.</i>

07:19.565 --> 07:23.277
<i>And the winner was Ogden Wernstrom.</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:36.206
Cara! Over here. Show us the dress.

07:36.582 --> 07:40.919
Oh, what's going on?
The photon pressure is knocking me over.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.672
Who are you wearing?
You look incredible.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.465
It's a brand new designer.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.135
- The Professor.
- Wha...

07:53.307 --> 07:57.144
All my life,
I've pursued my first love, science.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.980
But my career has come to naught.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.026
It's time to admit I should have pursued
my first love,

08:04.651 --> 08:05.694
fashion.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.035
- Oh, my.
- That'll look better on me.

08:23.587 --> 08:27.382
I've got a midlife crisis ponytail
for a Hubert Farnsworth.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.760
It's pronounced Hugh-bear.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.886
It is?

08:32.012 --> 08:36.475
Gorgeous, like a desiccated Zac Posen.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.728
Hugh-bear, I'm going to make you a star.

08:39.728 --> 08:43.065
I've made a few calls.
You're on a magazine cover, baby.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.192
Oh, my.

08:45.192 --> 08:50.781
I'm on the cover of <i>Vague.</i>
My mother would be so confused.

08:52.658 --> 08:56.036
It's Gladys Lennox,
the world-famous paramecium,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.789
star of <i>Mitosis, Lies and Videotape.</i>

08:58.789 --> 09:02.125
Is there something we can help you with,
Ms. Lennox?

09:02.125 --> 09:05.796
I saw the dress you made
and I must have one.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.465
I just love the stitch work.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.926
Thank you. It's holding my neck on.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.594
Cara's one of a kind.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.431
Not like those mass-produced
Frankensteins you see nowadays.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.976
Being boneless, clothing never fits me.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.520
It's like trying to put pants
on a waterbed.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.856
I once got the pants off a waterbed,

09:23.856 --> 09:27.109
but that's a very long,
very dirty story.

09:28.735 --> 09:33.740
I can make you an outfit, Ms. Lennox,
but it's a slow, meticulous process.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.742
Also expensive.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.496
Money's no object.
I have contractile vacuoles full of it.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.668
Gol'durned cytoplasm.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.378
Yeah! That's it!

09:46.378 --> 09:49.882
Make sweet asexual love to the scanner.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.884
No, don't shake your money maker.

09:51.884 --> 09:54.928
Give me less of that.
Don't work it, baby.

09:58.515 --> 10:02.311
Ooh. I want to give myself an award
for looking at that dress.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.396
Who are you wearing, Gladys?

10:04.396 --> 10:07.566
What, this little thing?
It's from the House of Professor.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.944
- Get me the Professor.
- Get me the Professor.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.571
Get me the Professor.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.114
The Professor.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.745
Tim Gunn here at Milan Fashion Week.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.497
Today, the hot, new, old designer

10:22.497 --> 10:25.542
whose name is on everyone's
silicone-filled lips:

10:25.542 --> 10:27.628
Hugh-bear Farntsvirt.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.965
Please, no photons.

10:40.224 --> 10:41.225
Two minutes.

10:41.225 --> 10:46.230
I'm so nervous, and I can barely move
in these high heeled slippers.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.899
How am I supposed to walk Marcelle?

10:50.526 --> 10:53.946
Not to worry.
Zoidberg will walk your leggy snake.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.539
<i>Welcome to the fashion event
of the millennium!</i>

11:03.539 --> 11:08.627
<i>We call it Haute Cocoon,
by the Professor. Enjoy.</i>

11:14.675 --> 11:15.759
I'll be...

11:21.849 --> 11:26.854
Shock me back to life with
a defibrillator because I am dead.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.233
I'm Zoidberg. I'm on the list.

11:32.818 --> 11:36.071
Sorry, we're full.
The anteater can come in, though.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.075
But I'm on the list. Right there.

11:40.993 --> 11:41.994
Now you're not.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.537
You're dressed like some sort of

11:43.537 --> 11:46.164
underpaid lobster doctor
from outer space.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.959
But I can't afford nicer clothings.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.627
Then beat it.

11:53.964 --> 11:58.802
I've never felt so worthless.
I'll just throw myself in the garbage.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.349
You can't come in our dumpster
what looking like that.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.226
Not during Fashion Week.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.949
You're a hit, Professor!

12:20.949 --> 12:24.995
You'll be invited to every party,
every soirée, every orgy.

12:24.995 --> 12:28.916
And I'll stay home napping.
Who's gonna stop me?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.127
Zoidberg! What are you doing?

12:32.127 --> 12:33.212
Jumping.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.965
- No, stop.
- You don't get it.

12:36.965 --> 12:41.887
Your fabulous clothing just makes
the other 99% of us sad and jealous.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.726
I'm sick of dressing in
factory reject chef's jackets

12:47.726 --> 12:49.978
and children's flip flops.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.064
Goodbye, fancy friends.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.317
No!

12:55.901 --> 12:57.110
Don't do it!

13:01.114 --> 13:03.784
Zoidberg, don't kill yourself!

13:03.784 --> 13:08.789
What? No, I'm just going underwater
where the fashion standards are lower.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.294
Excuse me,
the fashion standards aren't lower.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.047
Why, look at the flatlock seam
on my clam shells.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.352
Professor, when you started your line,

13:30.352 --> 13:33.063
you were proud the clothes
could fit anyone.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.858
But it's only the wealthy
who can enjoy them.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.651
I feel for you, Zoidberg.

13:37.651 --> 13:41.697
But there's simply no way
to mass produce my cocoon patterns.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.740
And moth chow isn't free.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.620
But isn't the difference between couture

13:48.620 --> 13:51.623
and ready-to-wear
just a matter of technology?

13:51.623 --> 13:53.834
Well, I suppose it is.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.044
I've never told anyone this,

13:56.044 --> 14:00.549
but it's been my lifelong dream
to be a famous scientist.

14:00.549 --> 14:04.595
Perhaps I could use science
to bring fashion to the masses,

14:04.595 --> 14:07.306
but no, I'm afraid it's completely...

14:07.306 --> 14:09.057
Eureka!

14:09.057 --> 14:12.477
Bender, hand me that hat
from my new October line.

14:17.816 --> 14:21.028
Fly, fly, my pretties!

14:27.159 --> 14:31.538
Welcome to <i>Good Morning Tonight.</i>
Or as I like to say, <i>Good Mor-night.</i>

14:33.165 --> 14:35.250
I will destroy you
and your entire species

14:35.250 --> 14:37.377
if you continue to combine those words.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.256
This mor-night, we have a very special
guest in the studio.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.801
Legendary fashion designer,
Hugh-bear Farntsvirt.

14:49.223 --> 14:52.518
Morbo has heard through his earpiece
that this wrinkly human

14:52.518 --> 14:55.729
now offers a clothing line
for a broader audience.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.147
Indeed I do.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.734
You see, I've created a variant
on the giant moth

15:00.734 --> 15:02.736
I use for my couture line.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.742
For a low monthly price,
you get a hanger moth for your closet.

15:08.867 --> 15:13.038
And it extrudes a bespoke
tailored outfit every day.

15:13.038 --> 15:16.834
They're essentially high-speed
3D silk printers.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.919
Morbo demands a demonstration!

15:26.969 --> 15:29.721
This just in. I look fabulous.

15:29.721 --> 15:33.350
These slacks really flatter
Morbo's pulsating buttocks.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.977
How do I wash them?

15:34.977 --> 15:36.728
Oh, no need to wash anything.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.648
The outfits fall apart
after one day's use.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.568
But they'd be out of fashion
by then anyway.

15:42.568 --> 15:46.738
Each night, just dispose of them
in my patented fash-can.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.496
It's fast fashion at its fastiest.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.331
Where do the clothes go?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.834
Who knows? Who cares?

15:58.834 --> 16:00.460
Tell us, Professor Farntsvirt,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.796
how can our viewers
get your new clothing line?

16:02.796 --> 16:06.758
Just leave the window open
and the light on.

16:41.752 --> 16:45.130
Great look, Zoidberg. Very today.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.215
Thank you.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.926
Though, to be honest,
I liked yesterday's even better.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.177
Would it be possible

16:50.177 --> 16:51.887
- to get those pants back?
- No!

16:51.887 --> 16:54.473
They made my hips look like I had hips.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.100
- But I threw them in the fash-can.
- Forget it.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.811
Yesterday's pants
are completely out of date.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.856
Hugh-bear, Zoidberg knows what he likes,

17:02.856 --> 17:05.901
and that means he has something
even better than fashion.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.569
He has style.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.697
- Wha...
- Plus, isn't it more environmental

17:10.697 --> 17:13.742
to wear a piece of clothing twice
before you throw it away?

17:15.327 --> 17:19.289
I would gladly crawl in after them,
but I can't fit in the fash-can.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.624
Anything can fit.

17:20.624 --> 17:25.379
The fash-can is a multi-dimensional
wormhole through space and time

17:25.379 --> 17:27.381
and probably some other things.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.383
Allow me to demonstrate.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.677
Jessica. Oh, Jessica.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.723
Go on, girl. Get your peanut.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.275
Professor! That's horrible!

17:46.275 --> 17:50.404
Relax. I get a new pet every day
to go with my outfits.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.197
That's slightly worse.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.741
It's simply too dangerous
to pass through

17:54.741 --> 17:58.287
a trillion light-year wormhole
for a pair of pants.

17:58.287 --> 18:01.373
Why, the temporal distortion alone
could render you...

18:07.754 --> 18:09.006
Whoa.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.632
That's what I was gonna say.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.843
We're coming out of the wormhole.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.261
There's a planet ahead!

18:22.811 --> 18:24.021
Shmoly-moly!

18:24.021 --> 18:26.273
If any civilization was here,

18:26.273 --> 18:29.067
it's been smothered
by the Professor's clothes.

18:29.067 --> 18:33.322
The devastation is too much.
It's beyond comprehension.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.407
My pants!

18:42.998 --> 18:46.168
All right, let's snag Zoidberg's pants
and get out of here.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.295
Bender, deploy the space hooker.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.963
Deploy her? I barely know her.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.425
Just kidding. I'm a regular customer.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.893
It's a total shirt storm.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.937
What do we do? Panic?

19:07.564 --> 19:10.567
A flock of Canadian bras got sucked
into the engine.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.069
We'll have to crash land.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.408
And we're fine.

19:18.408 --> 19:22.621
I believe we were spared for one reason,
and one reason only.

19:22.621 --> 19:25.541
To save Zoidberg's pants. Come on.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.879
- Wuzzat?
- Moths! Huge ones!

19:30.879 --> 19:34.424
They must be feasting
on high-protein sportswear.

19:34.424 --> 19:38.762
Actually, it's not the moths
that eat clothes. It's the caterpillars.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.849
People don't know that
because they're tiny and hard to see.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.242
And we're fine.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.620
What's this metal thing
we're cowering behind?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.914
Some sort of abandoned structure.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.126
The Professor really did destroy
a civilization.

20:09.126 --> 20:12.504
It's history's most brutal crime
of fashion.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.508
Ah, my pants!
There, in that pile of crisp whites.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.679
Oh, to wear them just once more!

20:22.723 --> 20:24.892
The Professor's garbage pets.

20:24.892 --> 20:26.476
Run for your lives.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.313
No. I am a professional fashion model.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.690
We do not run. We strut.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.360
And we do not leave our comrades'
fallen pants behind.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.031
Sounds good. We'll meet you in the ship.
And by meet you, I mean, ditch you.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.207
Cara, look out!

20:59.551 --> 21:01.929
Everybody on board.
Before we get buried.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.769
Jump!

21:11.396 --> 21:15.317
- Hang on. You'll be okay.
- But my grip is crumpling the pants.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.693
So I'll iron them.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.987
No, the material's too cheap.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.490
It won't stand up
to even the lowest setting.

21:21.490 --> 21:23.867
I'll wear them wrinkled.
I can pull it off.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.077
Don't be a fool.

21:25.077 --> 21:29.915
What is one life against
a completely decent pair of pants?

21:30.666 --> 21:31.792
Goodbye.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.087
Cara. No!

21:49.393 --> 21:50.936
Oh, good, you're back.

21:50.936 --> 21:55.732
I can toss yesterday's conquistador
ensemble without damaging the ship.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.656
Stop! We saw
where the clothes are going.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.950
You've wiped out an entire planet.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.660
Wiped out, you say?

22:06.660 --> 22:10.163
Well, if everyone is already dead,
I don't see the problem.

22:10.163 --> 22:14.042
Someone might still be alive
under all those vegan leather pants.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.087
Those are not breathable.
You gotta do something!

22:17.296 --> 22:19.756
Very well.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.302
The ship's log
should hold the space time coordinates

22:23.302 --> 22:25.053
of the planet you came from.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.931
I'll send them a jaws of life
or something.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.727
What is it? Something surprising?

22:31.727 --> 22:33.854
The planet you went to was...

22:34.354 --> 22:36.315
...was Earth!

22:38.025 --> 22:39.526
But that's our planet, right?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.862
And we're not buried
under miles of laundry.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.947
Don't you see, you imbecile?

22:43.947 --> 22:45.782
No, sir, I'm afraid I don't.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.368
It's Earth in the future.

22:48.368 --> 22:52.331
We sent the clothes to our own future!

22:59.630 --> 23:03.258
You finally did it,
you fast fashionistas!

23:03.258 --> 23:05.761
Damn you all to TJ Maxx!

23:06.512 --> 23:09.765
What kind of world have we left
for our children?

23:09.765 --> 23:11.183
Or their children?

23:11.183 --> 23:12.935
Or their children's children?

23:12.935 --> 23:16.021
Wait, how far into the future
did we send the clothes?

23:16.146 --> 23:17.606
What time is it?
