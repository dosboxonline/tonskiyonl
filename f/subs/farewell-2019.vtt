02:07.836 --> 02:08.837
Hello?

02:09.317 --> 02:10.416
Nai Nai, hi!

02:11.381 --> 02:13.550
Billi!

02:13.591 --> 02:15.468
It's the middle of the night,
why aren't you sleeping?

02:15.844 --> 02:18.471
Sleeping? I'm only 12 hours ahead!

02:19.431 --> 02:21.766
Isn't it 7AM in China?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.643
It's almost 7:30!

02:24.310 --> 02:25.645
Is it cold there?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.272
Are you wearing enough?

02:27.313 --> 02:28.356
Are you wearing a hat?

02:28.690 --> 02:29.566
I'm wearing one.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.901
Don't worry about me, Nai Nai!

02:32.360 --> 02:33.570
You have to be careful.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.113
I read that...

02:35.864 --> 02:38.616
in New York, people
will steal your earrings.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.826
They'll rip them out!

02:40.243 --> 02:42.662
And then you have to go to
the hospital for surgery.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.498
I'm not wearing earrings.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.501
Ah. So you heard too.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.130
What's that sound?

02:52.797 --> 02:53.757
Where are you?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.804
I'm at your great aunt's house.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.389
What are you doing?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.475
I'm going to Mom and Dad's...

03:03.838 --> 03:05.572
Do you have a second to save marine life?

03:05.852 --> 03:06.853
Hold on a second, Nai Nai.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.141
Alright.

03:08.143 --> 03:09.509
I was gonna say something snarky, but...

03:09.511 --> 03:10.577
I used to work this job.

03:10.579 --> 03:12.212
Ooh, what happened girl? You got fired?

03:12.214 --> 03:13.213
I quit!

03:13.215 --> 03:14.347
Because I was about to get fired.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.571
Who was that, Billi?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.990
Uh, no one, just a friend.

03:21.242 --> 03:21.993
What's that?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.579
It's nothing.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.292
I'll call you back later, OK?

03:29.364 --> 03:30.063
OK.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.003
Yeah, call me back, Nai Nai...

03:32.067 --> 03:33.099
Nai Nai?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.825
Where's my sister?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.576
She's with the doctor.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.008
OK Sis. Let's go.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.426
Did you talk to the doctor?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.596
Yep. You're in full health.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.139
Really?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.934
What about the CT scan?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.520
What about the spots they saw before?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.439
It's all clear.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.232
Turned out to be nothing.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.818
They're just benign shadows.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.113
Benign shadows? What's that mean?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.199
That's just what the doctor said.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.744
You're fine. Let's go, Sis.

05:32.287 --> 05:34.187
So one day the wife goes out of town.

05:34.189 --> 05:36.656
And when she returns, the husband says...

05:36.658 --> 05:38.725
honey, the cat is dead.

05:39.794 --> 05:43.563
And she says "How can you
tell me so abruptly like this?"

05:43.565 --> 05:46.332
You have to ease me into bad news."

05:46.334 --> 05:48.501
Like honey...

05:48.503 --> 05:52.071
the cat, he got on the roof.

05:53.541 --> 05:55.041
So...

05:55.643 --> 05:56.642
now...

05:56.644 --> 06:00.747
a few months later the
wife goes out of town again.

06:01.983 --> 06:05.218
And she returns, and the
husband greets her again.

06:05.487 --> 06:07.487
But this time he learned his lesson.

06:08.323 --> 06:11.324
And as the wife comes
through the door he says,

06:11.326 --> 06:14.360
"Honey, your mom, she got on the roof."

06:46.628 --> 06:48.161
How did you get in here?

06:59.407 --> 07:00.973
- Nai Nai?
- Billi!

07:01.546 --> 07:03.506
I'm sorry I hung up earlier.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.010
It's OK. What happened?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.763
Nothing. I'm good.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.640
You're spilling.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.061
You're spilling!

07:16.257 --> 07:17.390
Ooh!

07:19.939 --> 07:22.776
This old man. He's so careless!

07:23.276 --> 07:24.444
You mean Mr. Li?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.321
I never should have agreed to be with him!

07:26.696 --> 07:27.697
Nai Nai...

07:28.114 --> 07:29.699
He can't hear me anyway.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.659
He's practically deaf.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.079
Why are you still with him?

07:37.415 --> 07:38.875
It's been so many years.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.169
It's better than living alone.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.214
At least there's a live body in the house.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.550
Otherwise, when you get
up to go to the bathroom...

07:48.593 --> 07:51.137
all you see are your own shadows.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.227
Child...

07:57.602 --> 07:59.145
do you have a friend yet?

08:00.063 --> 08:02.524
I have a lot of friends, Nai Nai.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.861
I mean a special friend.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.365
You're all alone. I worry about you.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.575
New York is such a big place.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.581
Billi?

08:18.873 --> 08:20.125
Are you OK?

08:21.710 --> 08:22.585
I'm fine...

08:24.629 --> 08:25.880
I'm just tired.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.175
If you're tired, go to bed!

08:29.230 --> 08:29.962
OK.

08:30.832 --> 08:32.231
I love you, Nai Nai.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.634
I love you. I love you.

08:51.085 --> 08:52.084
For what month?

08:53.521 --> 08:55.588
For this month, May?

08:55.890 --> 08:57.657
And what happened to April?

08:57.659 --> 08:59.725
My mom says you didn't pay April yet.

09:03.398 --> 09:05.231
You know if you moved out
right now, we could literally

09:05.233 --> 09:06.465
double the rent?

09:12.273 --> 09:14.106
So what, you're broke again?

09:14.108 --> 09:16.242
Are you always going to live like this?

09:16.244 --> 09:17.743
Poor but sexy, I hope so.

09:19.047 --> 09:21.280
Why you not try to save, huh?

09:21.282 --> 09:23.883
You should change your expensive lifestyle.

09:23.885 --> 09:26.018
Mom, if you're going to
give me shit every time

09:26.020 --> 09:28.087
I come home, I'm not coming home anymore.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.089
Lower your voice. Dad's sleeping.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.291
Sleeping? It's 6:00 PM.
What's wrong with him?

09:32.293 --> 09:34.260
Nothing. He's just tired.

09:34.262 --> 09:35.561
Is he okay?

09:35.563 --> 09:38.030
He's fine, we're just busy that's all.

09:40.368 --> 09:42.535
Busy with what? What's going on?

09:44.772 --> 09:47.640
Hao Hao's getting married,
so we have to go to China.

09:47.642 --> 09:49.775
What? Since when?

09:50.311 --> 09:51.911
Hasn't he like just
started dating that girl?

09:51.913 --> 09:53.679
You don't need to go.

09:54.148 --> 09:56.148
No one's expecting you to go.

09:56.985 --> 09:59.218
I mean, he's my only cousin.

09:59.220 --> 10:00.686
Don't you think I should be there?

10:02.390 --> 10:04.490
OK, OK.

10:06.461 --> 10:07.960
Do you think he knocked her up?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.567
How many wontons you want?

10:14.969 --> 10:15.968
Five.

10:15.970 --> 10:17.336
Five? That's not enough.

10:17.338 --> 10:18.571
Make a dozen then.

10:19.641 --> 10:21.040
Ten's good.

10:22.410 --> 10:23.709
OK.

10:41.629 --> 10:43.195
What's wrong, Dad?

10:43.698 --> 10:44.764
Nothing.

10:47.201 --> 10:48.868
You and mom got in a fight?

10:52.507 --> 10:53.773
You've been drinking?

10:58.613 --> 11:00.513
Please tell me what's going on.

11:01.215 --> 11:02.848
You're scaring me.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.620
Something's going on.

11:08.389 --> 11:10.423
Just tell me what's going on.

11:14.696 --> 11:16.195
Your Nai Nai's dying.

11:19.801 --> 11:22.234
She has stage four lung cancer.

11:23.237 --> 11:25.538
The doctor says she has three months.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.973
Could be faster, you never know.

11:38.086 --> 11:39.919
- I need to call her.
- You can't do that.

11:39.921 --> 11:41.387
- I need to go see her.
- Can't do that.

11:43.091 --> 11:44.757
She doesn't know.

11:45.159 --> 11:47.860
The family thinks it's
better not to tell her.

11:47.862 --> 11:50.162
So you can't say anything.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.166
I don't understand.

11:54.902 --> 11:57.436
She doesn't have a lot of time
left, she should know, right?

11:57.438 --> 11:59.238
There's nothing they can do.

12:00.441 --> 12:03.476
So everyone decided it's
better not to tell her.

12:05.213 --> 12:06.345
Why is that better?

12:06.347 --> 12:08.347
Chinese people have saying,

12:08.349 --> 12:10.483
"when people get cancer they die."

12:12.086 --> 12:14.920
It's not cancer that
kills them, it's the fear.

12:19.627 --> 12:22.094
OK, when were you guys gonna tell me this?

12:23.397 --> 12:25.064
How could you let me find out like this?

12:25.066 --> 12:27.466
How should I have told you?
Oh, your grandma's on the roof?

12:31.639 --> 12:33.372
What about the wedding?

12:33.374 --> 12:36.475
The wedding is an excuse
so everyone can go see her.

12:37.578 --> 12:39.311
We leave first thing in the morning.

12:41.115 --> 12:42.448
I need to go.

12:42.450 --> 12:43.415
Billie.

12:43.417 --> 12:44.750
I need to go.

12:44.752 --> 12:46.919
Everyone thinks it's better if you don't.

12:46.921 --> 12:48.454
Look at you.

12:48.456 --> 12:50.890
You can't hide your emotions.

12:50.892 --> 12:53.726
If you go now, Nai Nai
will find out right away.

13:13.147 --> 13:17.082
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪

13:18.486 --> 13:23.355
♪ Happy birthday dear Tony
Happy birthday to you ♪

15:20.879 --> 15:21.463
Who's that?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.298
It's me, Billi.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.675
Who?

15:25.717 --> 15:26.843
Mr. Li?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.054
Billi.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.513
Billi?

15:30.805 --> 15:32.682
Child, how come you're here?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.100
Quick, come in!

15:35.643 --> 15:36.478
Pass that to me.

15:40.161 --> 15:41.293
- Billi!
- Huh?

15:42.317 --> 15:43.651
Billi came back...

15:44.569 --> 15:46.404
Billi, you stupid child!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.032
Come, let me look at you.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.284
Oh you're not that skinny!

15:51.659 --> 15:53.203
Your mother said you got skinny

15:53.787 --> 15:54.788
but you're not that skinny!

15:56.122 --> 15:57.374
Oh, my granddaughter.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.709
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.545
I've been calling you all week.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.047
But you didn't answer!

16:05.757 --> 16:08.885
Your mother said you were too busy to come.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.681
What's wrong?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.850
Why aren't you talking?

16:22.023 --> 16:22.941
I've missed you.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.985
I know.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.281
How'd you get here? Did you fly?

16:32.367 --> 16:33.827
I swam.

16:34.882 --> 16:36.482
Should have called first.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.834
Stupid child, teasing me!

16:42.293 --> 16:44.879
This little round butt
hasn't changed at all!

16:45.380 --> 16:48.925
I've always loved to touch
your little round butt!

16:57.809 --> 16:58.685
Little Nai Nai.

16:58.739 --> 16:59.772
Billi!

17:00.145 --> 17:02.772
I'm making meat pies. You must be starving.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.276
I remember these were
your favorite as a kid.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.486
This is Mrs. Gao.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.320
Hello.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.488
You're the granddaughter!

17:10.530 --> 17:11.614
You're back home too.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.782
- Yes.
- Great.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.786
Last time you were here,
we still had Mrs. Jin.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.330
I remember Mrs. Ma?

17:20.081 --> 17:22.834
Mrs. Ma? That was four maids ago!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.628
Has it been that long
since you've been back?

17:35.409 --> 17:37.443
Stop fooling around, oil is hot.

17:38.045 --> 17:39.511
Don't be mad, Mom.

17:41.849 --> 17:43.615
Where'd you get the money to buy a ticket?

17:44.385 --> 17:45.784
Credit card, right?

17:46.554 --> 17:49.054
Mom, I'm fine.

17:49.056 --> 17:51.123
Look at my face, look at my
face, look at my face, look.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.993
Take to table.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.290
It's been too long since we've
all been together like this.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.750
Has it been over 20 years?

18:04.334 --> 18:05.543
At least!

18:05.919 --> 18:08.088
Haiyan went to America 25 years ago.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.883
Billi was only six!

18:12.842 --> 18:14.719
And Haibin left for Japan right after.

18:15.011 --> 18:15.845
That's a long time.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.555
Time flies.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.267
These just came off the stove.
Eat them while they're hot.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.564
Look at these wonderful
grandchildren of mine!

18:27.273 --> 18:30.652
Billi is very strong. Independent.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.447
Not someone who just follows everyone else.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.367
Hao Hao's always been sensitive.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.704
Now he's all grown up.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.956
And getting married!

18:43.832 --> 18:46.459
I've been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.170
Too bad neither speak Chinese well.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.757
Hao Hao's Chinese is
good, he's just being shy.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.427
Hao Hao, talk to your grandma in Chinese.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.476
We don't need a big wedding banquet.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.855
We came to spend time with you.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.398
Nonsense!

19:08.440 --> 19:09.607
You came home to get married.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.609
We must have a proper banquet!

19:13.570 --> 19:16.781
Ma, let's just keep it simple.
We don't need to go overboard.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.366
Stop it!

19:18.408 --> 19:19.784
Everything's already booked.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.454
I sent invitations out last week.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.459
My only grandson's getting
married, we can't look cheap!

19:31.588 --> 19:33.256
Hao Hao, eat!

19:34.841 --> 19:35.759
Aiko.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.886
Have a meat pie.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.443
Why aren't you eating?

19:54.069 --> 19:55.153
I'm not hungry.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.616
How can you not be hungry?
You've been on the road all day.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.327
Take a big bite!

20:06.122 --> 20:07.082
It's good, right?

20:21.930 --> 20:27.352
Everyone says I'm adorable.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.667
What's wrong?

20:51.334 --> 20:52.377
Not feeling well?

20:56.381 --> 20:57.424
I'm fine.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.385
It must be jet lag. I'll
take you to the hotel first.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.303
Hotel?

21:03.221 --> 21:04.514
Why can't I stay here?

21:05.348 --> 21:08.101
With so many people visiting, it's
easier if we all stay at a hotel.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.978
I'll walk you there.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.565
Don't worry. The hotel is
very nice. It's newly built!

21:14.733 --> 21:17.694
Go get some rest. There's
lots to do before the wedding.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.165
I spoke to a cancer specialist in Japan.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.212
I bought her some medicine.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.050
From the Japanese doctor?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.931
From the Internet.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.730
Nai Nai...

21:56.191 --> 21:58.943
Nai Nai loves you very much, you know that?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.654
I know.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.912
Nai Nai is very sick.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.497
I know.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.376
She doesn't know anything
about her illness.

22:14.876 --> 22:15.835
I know.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.422
You have to be very
careful not to tell her.

22:19.964 --> 22:20.423
I know!

22:20.965 --> 22:22.842
Dad told me!

22:25.845 --> 22:27.263
You will feel sad.

22:29.933 --> 22:30.934
But...

22:31.851 --> 22:33.103
no matter how sad you feel...

22:33.812 --> 22:35.438
you cannot tell her.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.317
I know.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.196
She doesn't have long left.

22:43.697 --> 22:44.406
I know.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.367
We're not planning to tell her.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.244
I know.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.541
No matter what, you cannot tell her.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.295
What do you mean the elevator's broken?

23:00.213 --> 23:01.673
Isn't this a newly opened hotel?

23:02.257 --> 23:04.259
I'm so sorry, sir. It's under maintenance.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.219
This way please.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.346
I'll carry the luggage. I'm sorry.

23:09.543 --> 23:10.909
- Billi.
- Hm-mm?

23:11.224 --> 23:13.143
- You OK by yourself?
- Yes.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.020
- I'll head back.
- OK.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.313
- Rest well.
- I will.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.569
- We want the same room as last time.
- No problem.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.078
Are we almost there?

23:32.829 --> 23:34.748
Almost!

23:37.042 --> 23:38.376
Are you visiting from abroad?

23:39.002 --> 23:40.003
Yes.

23:41.671 --> 23:42.630
Which country?

23:43.715 --> 23:44.591
America.

23:45.133 --> 23:45.967
America?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.803
You don't look like an American.

23:52.349 --> 23:53.683
What'd you come back for?

23:59.397 --> 24:00.231
A wedding.

24:02.359 --> 24:03.610
Who's getting married?

24:04.903 --> 24:07.197
My cousin... my "tang di".

24:07.822 --> 24:09.366
Oh your cousin.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.201
He's also from America?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.286
No, Japan.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.081
Japan? What are they doing in Japan?

24:16.456 --> 24:17.999
I don't know.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.918
My uncle paints.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.173
Thank you.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.051
And what does your father do in America?

24:28.802 --> 24:30.011
He's a translator.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.806
Do you have water? For drinking?

24:33.098 --> 24:35.266
Yes! You can use this boiler.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.393
OK, got it.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.229
That's fine, thank you.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.566
So what do you think's
better? China or America?

24:44.859 --> 24:46.695
It's different.

24:47.696 --> 24:50.824
What do you mean different? It
must be much nicer in America.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.702
It's just... different.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.415
But I guess you're more
used to America, right?

24:59.624 --> 25:01.543
I guess.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.294
OK, if you need anything, just tell me.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.630
K, thanks. Bye.

25:05.692 --> 25:06.424
Thank you.

25:38.825 --> 25:39.824
Ha!

25:44.998 --> 25:45.830
Ho!

25:53.006 --> 25:54.339
Ha! Ho!

25:57.578 --> 25:59.311
Ha! Ho!

26:02.020 --> 26:03.438
Come do it with me!

26:03.584 --> 26:05.016
Ha! Ho!

26:08.355 --> 26:09.754
Ha! Ha!

26:10.357 --> 26:11.523
Ha! Ha!

26:12.113 --> 26:14.240
Be serious!

26:14.657 --> 26:16.117
Try harder.

26:16.910 --> 26:20.830
This will clear out all the bad toxins.

26:20.968 --> 26:22.033
Ha! Ha!

26:22.457 --> 26:26.836
Then you inhale to take in fresh oxygen.

26:27.629 --> 26:28.505
Understand?

26:29.005 --> 26:30.799
- Yes.
- Let's do it together.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.426
Inhale.

26:34.748 --> 26:36.348
Ha! Ha!

26:37.918 --> 26:39.050
Ha. Ha.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.767
Make it stronger!

26:41.351 --> 26:42.852
Open your eyes! Lift your chest!

26:43.353 --> 26:44.396
OK got it.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.522
- Do you get it?
- I get it!

26:46.606 --> 26:48.817
You can also slap your arms.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.028
Slap your back.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.072
Slap my butt?

26:54.906 --> 26:55.907
Stupid child!

26:57.200 --> 27:01.913
Slap your legs, get the circulation going.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.832
- Understand?
- Understand.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.960
Now you can practice this on your
own when you return to America!

27:07.627 --> 27:10.630
It's good for you! Trust me!

27:11.506 --> 27:12.632
Try again!

27:13.216 --> 27:15.218
Inhale...

27:15.689 --> 27:17.622
Ha! Ha!

27:17.624 --> 27:18.857
Ha! Ha!

27:24.602 --> 27:26.980
It's OK. I got it.

27:27.605 --> 27:30.817
I go up and down by myself every morning.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.111
Doesn't that hurt your legs?

27:33.737 --> 27:35.447
Even so, I have to keep exercising.

27:36.072 --> 27:39.200
It's the reason I'm so
healthy. Even at my age!

27:42.245 --> 27:44.622
- I heard you came back!
- Hi Auntie!

27:44.956 --> 27:46.791
- You remember Bao?
- Bao, say hi!

27:47.125 --> 27:48.793
Little Bao, you've gotten so big!

27:49.085 --> 27:49.961
I'm not little Bao!

27:50.337 --> 27:51.463
I'm just called Bao!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.090
Oh, Bao's here!

27:55.008 --> 27:56.801
YuPing, come sit come sit!

28:01.264 --> 28:02.223
Jian.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.730
Something's off about
Haiyan. Have you noticed?

28:10.607 --> 28:12.984
His face is all puffy and discolored.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.904
He seems very unhappy.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.031
He's fine, Ma.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.076
He looks so tired.

28:22.327 --> 28:23.661
Is he still drinking?

28:25.455 --> 28:28.750
You can't let him drink.
Alcohol can ruin a person.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.504
I know so many men around here
who drank themselves to death.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.964
He barely drinks anymore.

28:37.801 --> 28:38.885
Is everything OK at home?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.720
Everything's fine. Really, Ma.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.266
I know you guys have
had issues in the past...

28:46.518 --> 28:49.646
At our age, what issues
could we still have?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.450
They're just vitamins.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.328
Your uncle bought it for me from Japan.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.497
He says they're expensive.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.456
So they must be good.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.293
The Japanese really know how
to take care of themselves!

29:25.598 --> 29:27.267
Mr. Li, you finished?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.978
Don't mind him. That's just how he is.

29:30.687 --> 29:31.604
He eats and leaves.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.274
Doesn't care about anything
that doesn't concern him.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.235
Listen to me...

29:37.694 --> 29:40.238
I know everyone's excited to see me.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.450
But let's not forget why we're here.

29:44.743 --> 29:47.245
The wedding is the big event!

29:48.913 --> 29:50.248
If anyone asks

29:50.874 --> 29:54.002
nobody say Hao Hao and his bride
have only been dating 3 months.

29:55.003 --> 29:56.921
Ma, I already told you,
Aiko's not pregnant.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.550
It's about appearances.
You know how people think!

30:01.217 --> 30:03.511
I don't want people
talking behind our backs.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.056
If anyone asks

30:06.890 --> 30:09.976
just say they've been dating 6 months.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.228
Why 6 months? Might as
well say a year then.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.438
Great idea.

30:14.189 --> 30:15.732
A year's better. We'll say a year!

30:17.192 --> 30:18.610
Listen...

30:18.651 --> 30:20.320
the wedding's in 3 days.

30:21.696 --> 30:23.323
Someone needs to come see
the banquet hall with me.

30:23.782 --> 30:24.824
I'll come!

30:25.200 --> 30:28.078
No you can't be much help anyway!

30:28.787 --> 30:29.746
Ma, I'll go.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.706
No, you rest.

30:32.499 --> 30:34.834
Look at your face. It's not right.

30:35.502 --> 30:38.088
Ma, why don't you rest? I'll
go check on the banquet hall.

30:38.421 --> 30:39.673
I have to go myself.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.342
You don't even know who to talk to.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.387
What can I do?

30:47.806 --> 30:51.017
You don't need to do anything.
You don't look good either.

30:51.309 --> 30:52.560
Must still be the jet lag.

30:52.839 --> 30:53.438
Ma.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.063
I'll take them to the massage parlor.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.023
Oh great!

30:57.482 --> 30:59.025
You guys go relax.

31:00.318 --> 31:02.696
You better not get sick before the wedding!

31:03.988 --> 31:06.074
Eat eat eat!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.333
When I booked the wedding

31:15.709 --> 31:17.669
you guys told me it'd be lobster.

31:18.420 --> 31:20.880
Now you act like you don't
know anything about it?

31:20.922 --> 31:24.843
I don't know anything about that.
The menu says crab, not lobster.

31:25.844 --> 31:28.763
I know it says crab, but I ordered lobster!

31:29.305 --> 31:31.099
Fine. Let me ask.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.437
Little Ping! Little Ping!

31:37.522 --> 31:38.565
Go get the chef!

31:40.734 --> 31:41.609
Hurry up!

31:43.278 --> 31:45.238
Let's take a look at the alcohol options.

31:45.864 --> 31:49.367
We have baijiu, red
wine, white wine, beer...

31:49.409 --> 31:50.869
We're bringing champagne.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.287
Champagne?

31:52.328 --> 31:53.204
Your brother bought it.

31:53.747 --> 31:55.874
Looks very nice and expensive!

31:56.374 --> 31:57.834
Chinese people won't drink that stuff.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.295
Order baijiu!

32:01.379 --> 32:05.967
Mrs. Zhao says she was told the
meal would have lobster, not crab.

32:06.885 --> 32:08.595
It's not lobster, it's crab.

32:11.556 --> 32:14.100
What kind of scam is this?

32:14.601 --> 32:17.395
When I booked, you guys
told me it'd be lobster!

32:18.021 --> 32:19.606
We already paid a deposit!

32:20.065 --> 32:22.442
Now it's 3 days before the wedding

32:22.484 --> 32:24.736
and you change the menu without telling us!

32:27.072 --> 32:29.741
I don't know anything about
that. I was told to make crab.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.161
Ma, don't get all worked up over this!

32:37.332 --> 32:39.584
I'm fine. I just need to rest a bit.

32:49.756 --> 32:52.123
So what's going on with the fellowship?

32:52.125 --> 32:53.358
Nothing.

32:54.861 --> 32:57.028
You still haven't heard anything?

32:57.364 --> 32:58.429
No.

32:59.699 --> 33:01.165
Well, when are they gonna let you know?

33:01.167 --> 33:02.700
I don't know, Dad.

33:05.672 --> 33:06.971
How are you doing with money?

33:06.973 --> 33:08.106
I'm fine.

33:08.842 --> 33:09.941
Can you afford this trip?

33:09.943 --> 33:11.275
Yes, I'm fine.

33:11.678 --> 33:12.777
You need help?

33:12.779 --> 33:13.945
No, I'm fine.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.037
All set. Let's go.

33:19.124 --> 33:20.208
This way please.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.545
"Mei nu", what treatment would you like?

33:24.295 --> 33:26.423
Her Chinese isn't great. Give
her the full body massage!

33:26.881 --> 33:29.009
- Cupping too?
- The whole package.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.177
- Same for you, "mei nu"?
- I don't need cupping today.

33:31.564 --> 33:32.864
What is "mei nu"?

33:32.866 --> 33:34.632
It means beauty.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.808
Always "mei nu, mei nu."

33:37.100 --> 33:38.518
Everyone in China's called "mei nu."

33:38.810 --> 33:40.687
Old or young. Beautiful or ugly.

33:40.937 --> 33:42.772
All beauties! So stupid!

33:42.814 --> 33:44.190
Sir, what about you?

33:44.482 --> 33:45.984
You can call me beauty.

33:46.651 --> 33:48.278
I mean what kind of
treatment would you like?

33:48.695 --> 33:50.488
I recommend our bath and massage treatment.

33:51.156 --> 33:52.782
The tub is filled with herbs.

33:55.910 --> 33:56.828
What do you think?

33:57.370 --> 33:59.330
Why are you asking me?

33:59.998 --> 34:01.541
Ask yourself if you want to take a bath!

34:04.002 --> 34:07.172
- Can you show me the tub?
- No problem, this way please.

34:15.055 --> 34:15.889
Ow!

34:16.348 --> 34:17.891
Auntie, I thought this was a massage!

34:18.266 --> 34:19.267
Suck it up.

34:20.852 --> 34:23.980
A little pain is normal,
otherwise it doesn't work.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.113
Auntie.

34:32.192 --> 34:32.957
Hm-mm?

34:35.658 --> 34:38.703
Don't you think we should tell Nai Nai?

34:39.037 --> 34:41.706
Tell her? What for?

34:42.290 --> 34:44.334
Ow that hurts! What's going on?

34:44.793 --> 34:46.503
This is the sleeping point.
You haven't been sleeping well.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.381
Have you been stressed
lately? Try to relax.

34:53.093 --> 34:55.512
What if she has things to take care of?

34:56.137 --> 34:57.514
She doesn't have anything like that.

35:00.558 --> 35:01.309
What if...

35:02.018 --> 35:04.354
she wants to say goodbye?

35:04.896 --> 35:06.147
Say goodbye?

35:06.564 --> 35:08.066
That's too painful.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.318
Why would you want her to go through that?

35:11.111 --> 35:13.405
She seems totally normal right now.

35:14.197 --> 35:16.991
If you tell her, you'll
ruin her good mood, right?

35:26.001 --> 35:27.585
"Mei nu", get closer to him.

35:32.007 --> 35:35.385
Get closer! He told you to get closer!

35:35.885 --> 35:38.304
Come, lay your head on his shoulder.

35:39.389 --> 35:41.725
Hao Hao, wrap your arms around her.

35:42.892 --> 35:43.852
Your arm...

35:44.853 --> 35:45.979
hold him.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.230
Now smile.

35:49.357 --> 35:51.943
What's wrong with this girl?

35:52.485 --> 35:55.113
Can't they act like a
normal couple in love?

35:56.698 --> 36:00.118
That girl is unaffectionate.
Nothing like our family.

36:00.994 --> 36:04.330
I have to yell at her just to hug him!

36:05.040 --> 36:08.251
Makes me wonder what they do in
the bedroom when I'm not here.

36:08.585 --> 36:10.879
Nai Nai, she seems really nice.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.132
She's dumb. I don't like her!

36:14.674 --> 36:16.176
She doesn't understand anything!

36:17.093 --> 36:18.928
She doesn't understand because
she doesn't speak Chinese!

36:19.346 --> 36:20.930
No, she's dumb. She's dumb!

36:26.906 --> 36:27.972
Billi.

36:29.564 --> 36:31.024
Look at you.

36:31.649 --> 36:34.694
Smart. Beautiful.

36:35.278 --> 36:37.113
You must find someone to take care of you.

36:37.739 --> 36:39.324
I take care of myself, Nai Nai.

36:40.784 --> 36:43.078
You're still young, child.

36:44.412 --> 36:48.792
As you get older, it's good to
have someone to take care of you.

36:49.584 --> 36:51.503
Does Mr. Li take care of you?

36:55.173 --> 36:57.509
It's also good to be independent.

36:58.051 --> 37:01.179
A woman should be self-sufficient.

37:03.306 --> 37:04.599
Stupid child.

37:05.308 --> 37:07.018
Too lovable!

37:10.480 --> 37:12.482
I'll never forget...

37:13.817 --> 37:17.737
when your parents brought you to my
house, you were barely two years old.

37:18.446 --> 37:22.242
You were skinny as a twig...

37:22.659 --> 37:26.329
because of that horrible
nanny who stole your eggs!

37:26.871 --> 37:29.541
And she'd take you all over the city

37:29.874 --> 37:32.419
and only feed you popsicles!

37:33.294 --> 37:38.299
- Do you remember this?
- No. Why did she steal my eggs?

37:39.134 --> 37:41.344
Eggs were rationed back then.

37:42.095 --> 37:45.015
Your parents saved theirs to give to you.

37:47.892 --> 37:51.021
These last few days, there's
been too much going on.

37:51.604 --> 37:54.941
We haven't been able to talk much.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.071
Oh, sorry. We're lost. Sorry.

38:00.697 --> 38:01.823
You know...

38:02.991 --> 38:04.993
the wedding is very important.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.954
A lot of friends and family are coming.

38:08.455 --> 38:10.623
They haven't seen you
since you were little!

38:12.542 --> 38:15.086
I know you have a lot on your mind,

38:15.920 --> 38:18.673
but you can't be weird at the wedding.

38:19.341 --> 38:23.428
You must be generous in
spirit. And be courteous!

38:24.554 --> 38:29.768
When you see people, you should loudly
say, "Hello uncle! Hello auntie!"

38:30.352 --> 38:31.603
Don't be "nio nio ne ne."

38:32.771 --> 38:34.439
What's "nio nio ne ne"?

38:35.440 --> 38:37.192
- You don't understand?
- No.

38:38.401 --> 38:40.403
Watch me.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.202
Understand?

38:48.536 --> 38:53.124
If someone asks you to sing, don't say

38:54.668 --> 38:57.796
I can't sing, I won't sing.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.632
That'll make the whole room go cold.

39:00.793 --> 39:01.559
OK.

39:01.883 --> 39:04.135
Promise me you won't act like that.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.728
When you get married

39:14.396 --> 39:17.732
I'll throw you an even
bigger wedding banquet.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.201
It's so rare for us to be together.

39:28.535 --> 39:29.494
Just look at your mother's face.

39:29.786 --> 39:30.495
I'm happy.

39:31.162 --> 39:33.957
Come, let's toast.

39:43.842 --> 39:46.094
Billi, you ever think
about moving back to China?

39:46.553 --> 39:48.555
A lot of foreigners are
moving here to get rich.

39:49.180 --> 39:52.684
In America, how long would it
take to make a million dollars?

39:54.185 --> 39:55.020
A long time.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.438
Really?

39:56.896 --> 39:58.273
It's very easy in China.

39:58.648 --> 39:59.399
It's true.

39:59.774 --> 40:01.651
Life is not all about money.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.237
Money can't buy everything.

40:04.696 --> 40:05.989
But money doesn't get in the way.

40:06.906 --> 40:10.326
You can still enjoy the
stuff money can't buy.

40:11.244 --> 40:13.079
If it's so easy to get rich here,

40:13.496 --> 40:15.540
why are you sending Bao
to America for college?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.001
For more opportunity.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.378
What kind of opportunity?

40:21.671 --> 40:24.924
Maybe after going to America,
Bao won't care about money.

40:25.508 --> 40:27.427
Just like Billi. She'd
rather do what she loves.

40:28.303 --> 40:29.888
You guys don't have to worry,

40:30.430 --> 40:32.932
Billi will make big money when
she becomes a famous writer!

40:33.433 --> 40:35.769
You're investing in her talent.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.773
So raising a kid is like
playing the stock market?

40:39.892 --> 40:40.825
What's that mean?

40:41.994 --> 40:44.061
They say you're a stock
investment and you're gonna make

40:44.063 --> 40:45.362
us a lot of money.

40:46.265 --> 40:48.299
Well we can't expect that from you, right?

40:48.301 --> 40:49.967
You are the losing stock.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.244
You know...

40:53.828 --> 40:57.374
when we first moved to America,
a friend took us to a church.

40:58.124 --> 41:01.628
As we were leaving the service

41:02.087 --> 41:04.673
Billi suddenly stopped in front of a piano.

41:05.465 --> 41:07.717
She reached her hand out to
play, and Haiyan stopped her.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.303
The pastor came over

41:11.262 --> 41:14.391
and Haiyan quickly explained that
Billi used to play the piano in China.

41:15.183 --> 41:18.103
After we moved, we couldn't
afford it so Billi stopped playing.

41:18.937 --> 41:21.064
The pastor walked away
without saying a word.

41:21.106 --> 41:25.819
When she came back, she
handed us a key and said

41:26.611 --> 41:28.697
this is the key to the church.

41:29.322 --> 41:34.285
Bring Billi to play the
piano anytime you want.

41:36.162 --> 41:37.080
Really?

41:37.914 --> 41:39.708
They really just gave you the key?

41:42.502 --> 41:43.795
That's America.

41:45.791 --> 41:48.626
Mom, that church is not
representative of all America.

41:48.628 --> 41:50.160
We have a lot of problems.

41:50.162 --> 41:51.629
Guns. Health care.

41:51.631 --> 41:53.531
If you think China that
good, why don't you move here?

41:53.805 --> 41:55.598
China has its benefits!

41:55.932 --> 41:58.059
We're not totally useless.

41:58.518 --> 42:00.854
Of course. The roast
duck is still delicious!

42:01.229 --> 42:02.355
That's enough!

42:03.398 --> 42:06.067
No matter what, you can't criticize China.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.487
Don't forget, you're still Chinese!

42:10.530 --> 42:12.115
Technically, we're American.

42:14.242 --> 42:16.536
I mean, we have American passports.

42:18.163 --> 42:19.831
I'll always be Chinese.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.834
No matter where I live
or what passport I hold.

42:25.795 --> 42:29.341
You all may think the moon
is rounder outside China

42:30.133 --> 42:32.510
but have you considered your mother?

42:33.595 --> 42:35.305
Growing old without her kids around.

42:39.809 --> 42:40.935
Alright, alright!

42:41.853 --> 42:44.647
Everyone's home, let's
talk about happy things!

42:46.149 --> 42:47.108
But YuPing...

42:47.609 --> 42:50.070
you're still sending Bao
to America for college?

42:52.197 --> 42:53.907
He'll be back. He won't stay there.

42:54.282 --> 42:55.867
You can't guarantee that.

42:56.326 --> 42:58.244
But even with the risk that he won't return

42:58.703 --> 43:00.663
you'll still send him away, right?

43:10.840 --> 43:13.593
So how's your piano, Billi?

43:16.721 --> 43:18.348
I don't play anymore.

44:09.649 --> 44:12.235
Go home, I'm fine.

44:13.486 --> 44:14.946
How can I leave when
you're coughing like this?

44:14.988 --> 44:16.448
There's nothing to worry about!

44:17.073 --> 44:19.784
I just haven't gotten over the cold I had.

44:20.326 --> 44:21.578
Don't tell the children.

44:22.078 --> 44:24.080
- They'll be worried for nothing.
- I won't say anything.

44:26.958 --> 44:28.168
- Lock the door.
- Sure.

44:28.585 --> 44:29.627
Go home, Sis.

45:28.269 --> 45:30.230
OK Auntie. I'll meet you there.

45:30.689 --> 45:31.731
What's going on?

45:32.190 --> 45:33.358
Nai Nai went to the hospital.

45:34.286 --> 45:36.286
- What happened?
- I don't know.

45:43.796 --> 45:45.596
Billi, it's the wrong way.

45:46.932 --> 45:48.632
This way is fine.

45:48.634 --> 45:51.101
- We have to go around.
- He says it's fine.

45:56.475 --> 45:57.508
Which way are we going?

46:01.213 --> 46:03.113
Dad, do you know where we're going?

46:03.115 --> 46:04.782
- This way.
- My umbrella...

46:08.988 --> 46:10.621
- Is this the right way?
- Yes.

46:10.623 --> 46:12.055
Are you sure?

46:27.940 --> 46:29.640
Ma?

46:31.207 --> 46:34.044
Why'd you all come?

46:34.836 --> 46:36.421
You told them?

46:36.463 --> 46:37.630
I told you not to say anything!

46:37.881 --> 46:39.299
You always blame me!

46:39.716 --> 46:40.967
You can't disappear
without telling any of us.

46:41.343 --> 46:42.344
I'm fine!

46:42.635 --> 46:44.262
I'm going to find the doctor.

46:48.725 --> 46:51.102
What? Why are you all so serious?

46:51.728 --> 46:52.937
I just came to change my medicine.

46:53.313 --> 46:54.522
It's no big deal!

47:00.272 --> 47:01.538
Nai Nai.

47:01.946 --> 47:03.198
Do you not feel well?

47:05.658 --> 47:07.410
I just have a bit of a cough.

47:07.952 --> 47:10.121
I didn't fully recover from
the last time I had a cold.

47:10.872 --> 47:13.708
I just wanted to change my medicine.

47:14.167 --> 47:16.795
Maybe it'll work better.

47:17.379 --> 47:18.296
Doctor.

47:19.756 --> 47:21.132
Let's have a look.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.181
Inhale.

47:29.599 --> 47:31.017
Exhale.

47:34.187 --> 47:35.397
Cough.

47:39.150 --> 47:40.652
You have some infection.

47:40.694 --> 47:42.278
I'm already on antibiotics!

47:42.654 --> 47:44.239
You gave me bad medicine.

47:44.739 --> 47:49.869
Give me a better one, so I can heal faster.

47:51.162 --> 47:54.416
This is my grandson. He's
getting married in two days!

47:54.874 --> 47:56.543
Really? Congratulations.

47:57.419 --> 48:00.046
This is my granddaughter.
She's back from America.

48:02.568 --> 48:03.967
Visit from America?

48:04.503 --> 48:06.236
I went to school in the UK for many years.

48:06.238 --> 48:08.071
Oh, that's cool.

48:08.073 --> 48:09.106
Where do you live?

48:09.108 --> 48:10.507
Uh, I'm in New York.

48:10.509 --> 48:13.577
New York. I always
wanted to visit New York.

48:13.579 --> 48:14.912
It's a very beautiful city.

48:14.914 --> 48:15.946
Yeah, it's very beautiful...

48:15.948 --> 48:17.214
Uh, question...

48:17.216 --> 48:18.682
do you know about my grandma's condition?

48:19.024 --> 48:20.942
What are you guys talking about?

48:22.444 --> 48:24.863
He studied in England so he speaks English.

48:27.115 --> 48:27.991
Really?

48:28.366 --> 48:29.325
It's true.

48:31.745 --> 48:34.497
Dr. Song, let me ask you...

48:35.206 --> 48:36.082
are you married?

48:36.499 --> 48:37.542
Not yet.

48:39.085 --> 48:41.838
The young man's so handsome, and a doctor

48:41.880 --> 48:43.340
and he speaks English!

48:43.590 --> 48:45.675
Not married? Impossible!

48:46.045 --> 48:46.977
Ma!

48:49.448 --> 48:51.048
How bad is she?

48:51.283 --> 48:52.749
But you can tell me the truth.

48:52.751 --> 48:54.651
The cancer is quite advanced.

48:54.653 --> 48:56.453
Shouldn't we tell her?

48:58.590 --> 49:01.124
In her situation, most
families in China would

49:01.126 --> 49:02.626
choose not to tell her.

49:04.096 --> 49:07.130
When my grandmother had cancer,
my family didn't tell her.

49:09.969 --> 49:11.702
Isn't it wrong to lie?

49:12.604 --> 49:14.338
I mean if it's for good,
it's not really a lie.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.706
I mean, it's still a lie.

49:16.976 --> 49:18.175
It's a good lie.

49:19.511 --> 49:21.244
How's your grandmother?

49:21.647 --> 49:24.047
She passed away, a few months
after she was diagnosed.

49:28.718 --> 49:30.887
Mrs. Zhao, you had
pneumonia a few months ago.

49:31.346 --> 49:35.934
I suspect that your cough
is left over from that.

49:36.643 --> 49:38.353
Let's do an X-ray

49:38.812 --> 49:40.939
to make sure the infection isn't spreading.

49:41.648 --> 49:44.317
That's not necessary. I just
want to change my medicine.

49:44.734 --> 49:45.985
We can change your medicine.

49:46.486 --> 49:48.196
But I still recommend an X-ray.

50:08.633 --> 50:11.052
Maybe we should tell her now.

50:13.638 --> 50:16.433
We can start making plans.

50:17.767 --> 50:18.935
When the time comes

50:19.728 --> 50:21.312
who will take care of her?

50:22.272 --> 50:25.942
We don't need to tell her to make plans.

50:26.985 --> 50:29.738
You know, in America, we couldn't do this.

50:30.363 --> 50:32.866
We wouldn't be allowed to.

50:34.284 --> 50:34.909
It'd be...

50:35.087 --> 50:37.888
Illegal. How do you say illegal?

50:38.246 --> 50:40.915
Illegal. In America, this is illegal.

50:41.791 --> 50:43.043
This isn't America...

50:43.418 --> 50:45.754
It's not time to tell her yet!

50:47.130 --> 50:48.340
How do you know?

50:48.590 --> 50:50.175
I just know.

50:53.636 --> 50:56.973
If Nai Nai knew we were all
lying to her, wouldn't she be mad?

50:57.807 --> 50:59.059
What does she have to be mad about?

50:59.601 --> 51:01.853
She did the same thing herself!

51:03.521 --> 51:04.981
What do you mean?

51:10.195 --> 51:15.241
When your grandpa had cancer,
Nai Nai lied to him too.

51:16.368 --> 51:18.787
When she knew he was close to the end

51:19.412 --> 51:21.039
that's when she told him.

51:28.254 --> 51:30.382
When your Nai Nai reaches that point,

51:30.840 --> 51:32.842
I'll tell her too.

51:58.303 --> 51:59.669
Ellen!

52:00.870 --> 52:02.831
Ellen, Little Ellen!

52:03.373 --> 52:05.125
Sing for us!

52:11.423 --> 52:14.342
Ellen, sing another!

52:36.656 --> 52:40.243
Mr. Li, go get the Maotai we saved!

52:41.077 --> 52:43.163
Ma, there will be plenty
of alcohol at the wedding.

52:43.496 --> 52:45.457
Why don't you save your Maotai?

52:45.749 --> 52:47.584
What am I saving it for?

52:48.168 --> 52:52.213
You know your two sons!
They don't know when to stop.

52:53.256 --> 52:56.134
Haiyan already has a fatty liver.
The doctor told him not to drink!

52:57.510 --> 53:00.805
- Where is it again?
- On the kitchen shelf.

53:01.556 --> 53:04.142
These two rarely come back together.

53:04.642 --> 53:07.103
If they want to drink, let them drink!

53:07.479 --> 53:09.522
We're celebrating. Drink!

53:31.419 --> 53:33.505
Your mother's always telling
me to take care of you

53:34.130 --> 53:35.548
but if she gets you drunk herself,
she doesn't worry about your health.

53:35.767 --> 53:37.133
Mom, can we not do this right now, please?

53:37.509 --> 53:38.927
Every time you drink, you drink too much.

53:39.004 --> 53:39.502
Mom!

53:39.969 --> 53:41.012
Who's drunk? I'm not drunk.

53:41.106 --> 53:41.905
Can we not right now?

53:42.389 --> 53:44.224
My ma gave it to me. I drink for my ma!

53:44.265 --> 53:45.475
Alright, alright.

53:45.611 --> 53:46.676
Just leave him alone.

53:47.852 --> 53:49.104
Billi, the key.

53:59.858 --> 54:01.758
Nai Nai should not be
organizing this wedding.

54:02.794 --> 54:04.594
If she enjoys it then just let her do it.

54:05.397 --> 54:06.763
She's sick.

54:07.232 --> 54:09.065
She should be resting or in a hospital.

54:09.067 --> 54:11.067
Not stressing about a fake wedding.

54:11.069 --> 54:12.602
You really don't know your Nai Nai.

54:12.604 --> 54:15.572
You know she enjoys
bossing everyone around.

54:15.574 --> 54:17.474
Makes her feel important.

54:18.710 --> 54:20.110
Makes her feel in control.

54:20.112 --> 54:21.778
- Mom.
- It's true!

54:21.780 --> 54:24.547
That's why she hated to
stay in America in our house.

54:24.549 --> 54:25.882
You know?

54:25.884 --> 54:27.884
Because she could not
tell anyone what to do.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.754
Whatever I do, never good enough for her.

54:30.756 --> 54:33.890
But she can't say anything
because it was my house.

54:33.892 --> 54:35.458
Mom, stop!

54:35.460 --> 54:37.927
What? What did I say?

54:37.929 --> 54:40.163
You have always had issues
with her, but right now...

54:40.165 --> 54:42.132
Oh, I don't have a problem with her.

54:42.134 --> 54:43.466
She's the one that have a problem with me.

54:43.468 --> 54:44.567
She's dying.

54:44.569 --> 54:45.802
Can't you be a little more sensitive?

54:45.804 --> 54:46.903
What you want from me?

54:46.905 --> 54:48.505
To scream and cry like you?

54:55.080 --> 54:57.814
You know when my father
died, I was also very sad.

54:57.816 --> 54:59.916
But I don't act like you.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.254
When I went back to China for the funeral,

55:04.256 --> 55:06.122
everybody was watching me.

55:06.124 --> 55:08.625
They were all expecting me to fall apart.

55:08.627 --> 55:11.194
And they think if I don't
cry, I don't love my father.

55:11.196 --> 55:12.262
No one's asking you to cry!

55:12.604 --> 55:14.564
Too loud!

55:23.975 --> 55:26.976
I don't like, you know, put
all my emotion on display,

55:26.978 --> 55:28.611
like I'm in the zoo.

55:30.515 --> 55:33.983
But in here, if you don't cry,
you don't put on a show they

55:33.985 --> 55:35.852
think you don't love your family.

55:35.854 --> 55:38.621
You know in here, they even
hire some professional criers.

55:38.623 --> 55:40.457
Just to show how sad they are.

55:40.459 --> 55:43.193
It's just so ridiculous. I hate that.

56:25.427 --> 56:29.055
Your grandpa loved bananas.
Give him some bananas.

56:31.099 --> 56:32.851
You have to peel the oranges!

56:34.019 --> 56:35.603
I don't think they need to be peeled.

56:35.895 --> 56:36.855
Yes, peel them!

56:37.188 --> 56:38.815
Otherwise he can't eat them.

56:40.608 --> 56:41.776
Should I drink it?

56:44.890 --> 56:46.589
Pour, just pour.

56:46.591 --> 56:47.957
Yeah, pour, very good.

56:49.451 --> 56:50.910
Billi, put these cookies out.

56:51.244 --> 56:52.537
You have to open them!

56:53.288 --> 56:55.498
- They need to be opened too?
- Yes, open it!

56:56.166 --> 56:57.792
- Rip the flowers too!
- Why do we have to rip the flowers?

56:58.209 --> 56:59.461
To prevent thieves.

57:00.003 --> 57:02.672
Some people steal offerings to
put on their own family graves.

57:02.714 --> 57:04.174
This way they won't steal it!

57:09.179 --> 57:10.889
Don't give him cigarettes! He quit!

57:11.139 --> 57:12.640
He didn't quit.

57:13.350 --> 57:14.434
He did!

57:15.018 --> 57:17.145
A few weeks before he passed, he quit.

57:18.438 --> 57:21.483
Dad just told you he
quit, but he never quit!

57:22.108 --> 57:23.234
Ma, let the man smoke.

57:23.610 --> 57:25.904
He's already dead, what else can happen?

57:26.446 --> 57:27.697
Enjoy the cigarette, Dad.

57:53.390 --> 57:55.225
Burn the paper jacket for your grandfather.

57:55.892 --> 57:58.395
That way, he won't be cold in the winter.

58:00.647 --> 58:02.857
Old timer, we all came to see you.

58:03.274 --> 58:05.235
Our grandson's getting married tomorrow.

58:05.652 --> 58:07.362
We came to get your blessing.

58:08.405 --> 58:10.699
We ask you to bless Hao
Hao and his new bride.

58:11.241 --> 58:12.450
Bless them with happiness.

58:13.076 --> 58:15.412
Bless their children
with health and strength.

58:15.995 --> 58:17.372
One bow.

58:18.415 --> 58:20.000
Two bows.

58:20.792 --> 58:22.711
Three bows.

58:23.628 --> 58:26.089
Old timer, you left us too soon.

58:27.048 --> 58:28.842
Why did you have to leave so early?

58:29.342 --> 58:31.344
Wherever you are...

58:31.886 --> 58:34.931
we hope you're happy and peaceful.

58:35.849 --> 58:37.642
One bow.

58:38.268 --> 58:39.978
Two bows.

58:40.770 --> 58:42.022
Three bows.

58:43.440 --> 58:52.115
Bless both our sons with
success in their businesses.

58:53.033 --> 58:54.617
One bow.

58:55.368 --> 58:57.078
Two bows.

58:57.746 --> 58:58.705
Three bows.

58:59.706 --> 59:02.334
Who else?

59:02.917 --> 59:04.753
Bless Billi.

59:05.587 --> 59:08.006
Bless her with a happy future.

59:08.798 --> 59:10.383
One bow.

59:10.884 --> 59:12.135
Two bows.

59:12.802 --> 59:14.471
Three bows.

59:14.512 --> 59:15.513
Still bowing?

59:15.972 --> 59:17.223
We're all getting dizzy!

59:17.640 --> 59:21.102
Bless my little sister. Bless her...

59:22.020 --> 59:23.938
Bless me to win big money in Mahjong!

59:25.065 --> 59:27.359
Bless your niece, YuPing.

59:27.984 --> 59:29.235
And Bao.

59:29.861 --> 59:31.905
Bless him to do well on his exams.

59:40.955 --> 59:42.707
Bao, keep up!

59:50.423 --> 59:53.134
When the time comes, just
spread my ashes into the ocean.

59:54.010 --> 59:57.055
No one's ever home anyway.

59:57.514 --> 59:59.057
What are you talking about? I'm here!

01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:02.185
Just scatter me into the ocean.

01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:04.771
Then you won't have to travel
back and forth all the time.

01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:07.023
Into the ocean? Nonsense!

01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:09.067
- You don't agree?
- Certainly not.

01:00:09.317 --> 01:00:10.110
We're Chinese.

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.278
Humans must return to
the earth we came from!

01:00:23.842 --> 01:00:25.808
Wait! This looks so familiar.

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.086
This is NaiNai's old neighborhood.

01:00:28.513 --> 01:00:30.346
Do you remember that house?

01:00:30.348 --> 01:00:32.115
You used to love to play in the garden.

01:00:32.117 --> 01:00:32.882
Where is it?

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:34.592
We already passed it.

01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:37.721
Can we go back? I want to see it!

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.931
There's nothing to see.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:44.060
That neighborhood is long gone.
Even I don't recognize it anymore.

01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:03.371
OK, OK, that's enough.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:05.373
- Enough?
- Yes.

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:07.542
Careful, don't burn yourself.

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:33.109
Dad?

01:01:33.812 --> 01:01:34.677
Huh?

01:01:36.981 --> 01:01:38.314
Are you smoking?

01:01:38.683 --> 01:01:39.582
Hm-mm.

01:01:40.719 --> 01:01:42.185
I thought you said you quit.

01:01:42.187 --> 01:01:43.553
I did.

01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:45.054
I will.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.123
Stop giving him cigarettes!

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.626
Don't control him.

01:01:50.543 --> 01:01:52.504
He's your father. You
shouldn't try to control him.

01:01:53.932 --> 01:01:55.498
Go to bed, Billi.

01:01:56.966 --> 01:01:58.259
Forget it.

01:02:01.573 --> 01:02:03.339
What're you guys talking about?

01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:04.240
Nothing.

01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.689
Are you going to tell Nai Nai?

01:02:16.986 --> 01:02:18.446
I can't, Billi.

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:21.324
I won't go against my family.

01:02:24.095 --> 01:02:25.194
Billi.

01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:29.332
There are things you must understand...

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:33.086
you guys moved to the West long ago.

01:02:34.504 --> 01:02:37.382
You think one's life belongs to oneself.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:42.387
But that's the difference
between the East and the West.

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:50.186
In the East, a person's
life is part of a whole.

01:02:52.939 --> 01:02:54.190
Family.

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:56.234
Society.

01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:07.120
You want to tell Nai Nai the truth...

01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:09.706
because you're afraid to
take responsibility for her.

01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:12.292
Because it's too big of a burden.

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:13.960
If you tell her...

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.629
then you don't have to feel guilty.

01:03:18.506 --> 01:03:20.675
We're not telling Nai Nai...

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:24.387
because it's our duty to carry
this emotional burden for her.

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.911
Billi, don't just stand there.
Come help find Aiko's earring.

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:50.747
Where did she drop it?

01:03:50.997 --> 01:03:52.499
Not far.

01:03:53.249 --> 01:03:54.125
Hao Hao.

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:56.670
Where's Aiko been?

01:03:57.379 --> 01:04:02.258
The earring is light, so it
could have jumped farther away.

01:04:11.502 --> 01:04:13.469
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:04:13.471 --> 01:04:16.939
I want to stay in China and
help take care of Nai Nai.

01:04:17.909 --> 01:04:19.342
What?

01:04:19.344 --> 01:04:21.744
You stay here, to do what?

01:04:21.746 --> 01:04:23.779
You can't cook, you can't clean.

01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:26.741
You don't even speak good
Chinese. What can you do?

01:04:27.617 --> 01:04:28.993
Is this it, Hao Hao?

01:04:30.286 --> 01:04:31.579
Thank you!

01:04:33.892 --> 01:04:35.157
I'll figure it out, Mom.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.227
So you just stay here.

01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:39.362
And what?

01:04:39.364 --> 01:04:40.763
Wait for her to die?

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.532
What about the fellowship?

01:04:43.534 --> 01:04:45.468
Just forget about it, huh?

01:04:46.204 --> 01:04:48.571
You're 30 years old, you
can just stop your life

01:04:48.573 --> 01:04:49.672
and stay here?

01:04:51.276 --> 01:04:54.577
And every day she has to look at
you, with that sad looking face?

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.179
That's not nice for anybody, right?

01:05:00.385 --> 01:05:04.020
You know, one of the few
good memories of my childhood,

01:05:04.022 --> 01:05:06.355
were the summers at Nai Nai's.

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.391
They had that garden.

01:05:08.393 --> 01:05:10.860
Ye Ye and I would catch dragonflies.

01:05:12.897 --> 01:05:14.630
And then we just moved to the States.

01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:16.265
Everything was different.

01:05:16.267 --> 01:05:17.800
Everyone was gone.

01:05:17.802 --> 01:05:19.535
And it was just the three of us.

01:05:25.643 --> 01:05:27.310
I know it was hard.

01:05:27.645 --> 01:05:29.645
It was hard for us too.

01:05:31.816 --> 01:05:35.785
I wanted to believe
that it was a good thing,

01:05:37.989 --> 01:05:40.323
but all I saw was fear in your eyes.

01:05:41.926 --> 01:05:46.162
And I was confused and scared constantly

01:05:46.164 --> 01:05:48.564
because you never told
me what was going on.

01:05:53.938 --> 01:05:55.638
And then Ye Ye died.

01:05:56.341 --> 01:05:58.074
You didn't even tell me he was sick.

01:05:59.777 --> 01:06:01.677
So it felt like he just...

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:03.245
vanished suddenly.

01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:06.449
And you wouldn't even
let me go to his funeral.

01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:07.950
You were at school.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:09.919
We didn't want you to miss school.

01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:11.654
We did what we thought was best for you.

01:06:11.656 --> 01:06:13.522
But I never saw him again.

01:06:15.326 --> 01:06:17.326
And every time I came
back to China, he just

01:06:17.328 --> 01:06:18.995
wasn't there anymore.

01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:23.666
And I come back and he's just gone.

01:06:25.336 --> 01:06:31.374
The house is gone, A Die's gone,
our Beijing home is gone and

01:06:31.376 --> 01:06:33.009
soon she'll be gone, too.

01:07:36.514 --> 01:07:37.849
Guests first!

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.309
Strive for excellence!

01:07:39.684 --> 01:07:40.852
Make romance!

01:07:41.227 --> 01:07:42.437
Become history!

01:07:42.812 --> 01:07:44.189
Witness happiness!

01:07:44.522 --> 01:07:45.857
Move your whole life!

01:07:45.899 --> 01:07:48.068
We welcome your visit!

01:07:56.127 --> 01:07:57.326
Billi!

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:00.997
Hello Auntie!

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:02.791
Hello Auntie!

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:09.547
Did you get the X-ray results?

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:11.091
No, I'll get them tomorrow.

01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:13.968
Tomorrow's Sunday! Now we'll
have to wait until Monday!

01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:16.471
So I'll get them Monday! Stop worrying!

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.066
Welcome back to Changchun everyone!

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:33.113
It doesn't matter if
you're from America or Japan

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:35.907
or anywhere else in the world.

01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:39.285
What's important is that
we're all one family.

01:08:40.286 --> 01:08:41.413
All citizens of the Earth.

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:43.039
Of the solar system.

01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:44.624
Of the Milky Way.

01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:47.252
Just remember this!

01:08:47.293 --> 01:08:49.421
You'll always have a home in Changchun.

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:54.592
We will always, always welcome you.

01:08:55.802 --> 01:08:58.888
Yes. We will always, always welcome you!

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.599
Everybody raise your glass, let's toast.

01:09:03.601 --> 01:09:05.520
When you come home to Changchun

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:09.774
you will eat well, drink well and be happy!

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.319
That way, you'll remember
to come back often!

01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:17.240
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:34.716
Everyone keep eating, keep eating.

01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:36.301
Don't let me interrupt.

01:09:37.427 --> 01:09:41.431
As the oldest son, I'll say a few
words on behalf of me and my brother.

01:09:46.144 --> 01:09:47.479
My brother and I...

01:09:48.938 --> 01:09:52.817
have not been home at the
same time in over 25 years.

01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:55.695
Today, I'm very happy.

01:09:56.905 --> 01:09:59.783
We're welcoming Aiko to our family.

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:05.288
Perhaps the next time we return

01:10:06.164 --> 01:10:08.249
we'll bring a little baby with us.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.710
Since my brother and I have been away

01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:13.213
we're grateful to you all
for taking care of our mother.

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:15.006
YuPing...

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:20.720
all these years, you've
been by my mother's side.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.057
Treating her like your own mother.

01:10:25.183 --> 01:10:26.851
I'm very grateful to you.

01:10:27.852 --> 01:10:29.104
Really, very grateful.

01:10:34.984 --> 01:10:35.985
But...

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.615
the person I want to thank the most...

01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:51.084
the person I want to thank the most...

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.339
is my mother.

01:11:05.306 --> 01:11:06.474
Ma...

01:11:07.475 --> 01:11:08.768
forgive me.

01:11:10.186 --> 01:11:12.981
All these years, I
haven't been by your side.

01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:17.235
Everything...

01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:20.363
all of my accomplishments...

01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:22.782
are because of you.

01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:26.036
Ma...

01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:30.290
you're the best mother in the entire world!

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:33.960
Thank you.

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:53.980
I'm sorry.

01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:56.399
I'm just too happy today.

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:58.777
Happy thank you.

01:12:17.822 --> 01:12:19.455
Does everyone know?

01:12:19.457 --> 01:12:21.023
I think most people don't know.

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:23.392
But I'm not sure.

01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:24.793
Billi?

01:12:27.597 --> 01:12:29.349
Eat more.

01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:39.442
She says

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:43.071
"Thank you for attending
our wedding ceremony."

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:51.454
She says

01:12:52.038 --> 01:12:54.499
"I'm very happy to celebrate with you all."

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:02.173
She says

01:13:02.632 --> 01:13:06.803
"Hao Hao is a very nice, good man."

01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:23.486
The battlefield in front
of us. Hoards of enemies!

01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:26.322
There were only a few of us left.

01:13:27.073 --> 01:13:28.241
And then, let me tell you...

01:13:28.616 --> 01:13:29.784
I used my martial arts skills.

01:13:30.201 --> 01:13:32.287
I killed five at once!

01:13:33.997 --> 01:13:35.081
This is my granddaughter!

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.083
She's quite pretty!

01:13:37.667 --> 01:13:38.793
Married yet?

01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:39.794
Not yet.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.088
Career first, then marriage!

01:13:44.549 --> 01:13:48.720
These three grandpas
were in the army with me.

01:13:49.262 --> 01:13:53.266
They're all important
government officials now!

01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:54.517
Yeah, right!

01:13:54.934 --> 01:13:56.561
We're long retired!

01:13:57.854 --> 01:13:58.980
Little Ting...

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.149
I see you're still limping.

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:04.319
Is it from that bullet you took in the war?

01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:06.237
You still remember that?

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:07.697
How could I forget?

01:14:08.573 --> 01:14:10.325
At the time, I had a plan.

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:12.410
After the war...

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:14.579
I was going to make you my wife!

01:14:15.914 --> 01:14:18.124
But then you got injured.

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:20.669
And Comrade Wang carried you off.

01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:23.004
That was a lifetime ago!

01:14:23.296 --> 01:14:25.382
You're confessing your love now?

01:14:25.799 --> 01:14:28.385
If I don't say it now,
I'll take it to my grave!

01:14:28.426 --> 01:14:29.886
You've had too much to drink!

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:32.472
It's good I'm telling
you, right Little Ting?

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:35.266
Little Ting? I'm OLD TING!

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.311
This time home

01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:40.647
you should talk more with your grandmother!

01:14:43.108 --> 01:14:44.109
You've had too much to drink.

01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:45.777
What are you talking about?

01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:49.656
Billi, go up and say a few words.

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:03.420
Hi everyone.

01:15:05.755 --> 01:15:10.218
As you know, I was very
young when I left China.

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:15.473
My Chinese isn't very good. I'm sorry.

01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:17.684
It's great! Keep going!

01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:19.434
Thank you.

01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:24.315
I almost didn't come back.

01:15:25.525 --> 01:15:27.861
I was busy with work.

01:15:28.653 --> 01:15:29.529
But...

01:15:30.238 --> 01:15:32.407
I still came back.

01:15:36.578 --> 01:15:37.662
In America

01:15:38.413 --> 01:15:40.206
we don't have a lot of family.

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.709
I've missed all of you.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.879
I'm very happy to be back.

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:48.256
I'm very happy

01:15:49.174 --> 01:15:52.052
to celebrate with you all.

01:15:54.872 --> 01:15:55.837
Thank you.

01:16:01.579 --> 01:16:02.778
I'm sorry.

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.379
Sorry, how do you say congratulations? Dad?

01:16:04.381 --> 01:16:05.380
Gong xi!

01:16:05.382 --> 01:16:07.916
Gong xi Hao Hao Aiko! Thank you.

Auntie?

01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:05.542
It must be tough taking care
of your sister all these years.

01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:09.004
In the future, you have to
think more about yourself.

01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:11.089
You don't have to worry about me.

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:13.550
I've already figured it all out.

01:17:15.552 --> 01:17:16.720
After she's gone...

01:17:17.887 --> 01:17:21.141
I'll go to Shenzhen to be with my husband.

01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:24.602
He's been out there working
alone all these years.

01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:26.771
It hasn't been easy.

01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:30.400
I haven't been able to be by his side.

01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:36.948
When he retires soon, we'll
be able to travel together.

01:17:37.532 --> 01:17:39.117
You can come visit us in America!

01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:43.121
Right! Definitely! I've always
wanted to see your house!

01:17:43.496 --> 01:17:45.498
If you come, we'll drive you around.

01:17:45.832 --> 01:17:46.958
We'll take you anywhere you want to go!

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.085
Great! That's fantastic!

01:17:50.378 --> 01:17:52.005
See, you don't have to worry about me.

01:17:52.714 --> 01:17:54.549
I'm totally fine!

01:21:33.059 --> 01:21:34.019
Everyone stand up straight!

01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:35.812
Look into the lens!

01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:40.150
Why are you crying? Did you drink too much?

01:21:40.191 --> 01:21:44.112
You can't take a wedding
photo with the groom crying.

01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:46.489
What are you crying about?

01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:51.036
He's fine. They're tears of joy.

01:21:51.619 --> 01:21:53.663
Isn't that right, Hao Hao?

01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:56.249
Will you take one with my camera too?

01:21:56.875 --> 01:21:58.960
Sis, where's my camera?

01:21:59.002 --> 01:22:00.545
I gave it to Mrs. Gao. It's in her purse.

01:22:01.379 --> 01:22:02.589
Where is she?

01:22:03.173 --> 01:22:06.509
I sent her to the hospital
to pick up my test results.

01:22:07.218 --> 01:22:09.012
Everyone say "eggplant!"

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:09.929
One, two three!

01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:11.639
Eggplant!

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:14.411
- Test result pickup?
- Upstairs.

01:23:21.543 --> 01:23:22.377
Mrs. Gao!

01:23:26.631 --> 01:23:27.674
What are you doing here?

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:30.719
- Did you get them?
- The test results? Yeah.

01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:33.138
What's the matter? What's it say?

01:23:33.763 --> 01:23:35.223
I don't know. I can't read Chinese.

01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:36.808
Didn't you read it?

01:23:37.475 --> 01:23:40.311
I can't read. I never went to school.

01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:49.362
How am I supposed to change this?
What do you want to me write here?

01:23:49.612 --> 01:23:51.364
Just change it to benign shadows.

01:23:52.365 --> 01:23:54.868
Benign shadow? What's a benign shadow?

01:23:55.535 --> 01:23:57.537
It means it's not fatal!

01:23:59.456 --> 01:24:00.373
Fine.

01:24:11.718 --> 01:24:12.677
You see

01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:15.221
I told you I was fine!

01:25:32.465 --> 01:25:33.591
Don't give me money!

01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:34.926
Take it.

01:25:36.094 --> 01:25:37.303
Just take it.

01:25:38.179 --> 01:25:40.890
I gave one to Hao Hao, so
I have to give you one too.

01:25:41.307 --> 01:25:43.018
I didn't get married.

01:25:43.059 --> 01:25:44.436
Even more reason!

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.648
You're all on your own.
And I can't be much help.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:50.525
Take it, my child.

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:55.447
And don't spend it on
practical things like rent!

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:58.199
Buy yourself something nice.

01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:05.874
I don't want to leave.

01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:11.713
You'll be back.

01:26:13.882 --> 01:26:17.344
I know you're always thinking of me.

01:26:18.595 --> 01:26:20.889
But I've been taking my new medicine...

01:26:21.264 --> 01:26:22.349
and I'm all better!

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.851
You have work to do.

01:26:25.852 --> 01:26:27.979
You still have a long road ahead.

01:26:28.521 --> 01:26:30.732
I'm very proud of you.

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:35.111
I didn't get the fellowship.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.988
Really?

01:26:37.739 --> 01:26:39.074
You just heard?

01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:41.743
Last week.

01:26:42.869 --> 01:26:44.079
I didn't tell you because

01:26:44.996 --> 01:26:46.498
I didn't want you to worry.

01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:51.920
I'm not worried.

01:26:53.004 --> 01:26:55.090
You'll be fine, child.

01:26:56.466 --> 01:27:00.220
I've walked the path of
life and I must tell you

01:27:01.429 --> 01:27:06.351
you'll encounter difficulties,
but you have to keep an open mind.

01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:10.063
Don't be the bull endless ramming
its horns into the corner of the room.

01:27:10.563 --> 01:27:14.317
Life is not just about what you do

01:27:14.859 --> 01:27:17.237
it's more about how you do it.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.243
Your mind is very powerful.

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:25.704
You will succeed.

01:27:27.747 --> 01:27:29.290
Are you really OK?

01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:30.750
Yes, really!

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:32.961
Why would I lie to you?

01:27:33.628 --> 01:27:34.713
Stupid child!

01:27:37.966 --> 01:27:39.843
Let's go, you'll miss your flight!

01:27:53.565 --> 01:27:55.900
You don't need to come down!

01:27:55.942 --> 01:27:58.028
I'm fine! I'm coming!

01:28:09.581 --> 01:28:11.041
Don't cry, Nai Nai.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.210
I'm not, I'm not.

01:28:14.794 --> 01:28:17.964
Stupid child! I'm not crying.

01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:20.467
- You don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:23.928
I'll visit you again.

01:28:24.387 --> 01:28:28.725
I know. We'll see each other very soon.

01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:34.314
Go on, let's not drag this out anymore.

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:37.108
Otherwise I can't take it. Hurry up!

01:28:39.444 --> 01:28:41.946
Go on, get in the car!

01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:44.824
- Take care, Ma.
- I know, I will.

01:28:45.575 --> 01:28:48.244
- Go back inside, Ma!
- I'll go after you get in the car!

01:28:49.662 --> 01:28:52.707
- Go upstairs, Ma! It's chilly!
- Hurry up, you'll miss your flight!

01:28:54.834 --> 01:28:57.420
Be good, my child.

01:32:32.168 --> 01:32:33.334
Ha!!

01:32:35.605 --> 01:32:36.904
Ha!!

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:55.856
Ha! Ho! Ha! Ho!

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:25.094
