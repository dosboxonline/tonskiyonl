of thermodynamics

from one form to another.

- Answer the question.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.389
She told me not
to say anything. I just...

I know how much
you all care about her.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.397
When you told me
about your mom...

12:11.398 --> 12:13.275
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.612
I wanted to help.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.031
But you have to understand,

12:21.032 --> 12:23.076
what's happening is
a good thing.

12:24.369 --> 12:28.582
Elgin, you said she told you
not to say anything. Who is she?

12:30.500 --> 12:33.669
I know it sounds crazy,
but I think she's an angel.

- [Elgin] She's here to help us!

like in the Bible.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.890
People never really
understood then.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.434
But they had faith,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.186
even when it was hard,

12:50.187 --> 12:53.439
especially when it's hard.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.067
Fatima's baby is going
to save all of us.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.946
Hey, Elgin, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.576
- There is no baby.
- That's not true.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.621
Kristi and Marielle did
an ultrasound in the clinic.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.331
And when they
pulled up the image,

13:10.332 --> 13:12.291
there was nothing there.

13:12.292 --> 13:17.004
Whatever's growing
inside her is not a child.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.632
The things it's done to her,
the things it's made her do--

13:19.633 --> 13:22.676
You don't understand.
She explained all that to me.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.678
Wait. The angel?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.056
Yes.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.060

13:32.270 --> 13:37.359
The day we met, I...
told you I killed my brother.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.446
Do you know why that happened?

13:42.447 --> 13:45.366
There were voices here
that told me

13:45.367 --> 13:48.662
if I killed a little boy,
we would all get to go home.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.623
This place...

13:52.624 --> 13:54.333
it doesn't give.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.710
It takes.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.463
And what it's doing to you--

13:59.464 --> 14:01.258
But do you see how
it's different?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.343
No one is dying here.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.345
Fatima is gonna be fine.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.682
You don't fucking know that,
okay? You don't know that!

14:10.267 --> 14:14.061
Once the baby is born,
we all get to go home.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.690
Elgin, even if she's pregnant,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.316
that's still months away.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.986
No. It's grown.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.697
You should see Fatima's belly.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.115
- Okay. Where the fuck is she?
- No, no, no! Hey!

14:26.116 --> 14:27.741
- Where the fuck is she?
- I can't!

14:27.742 --> 14:29.243
- Kenny!
- [all shouting at once]

14:29.244 --> 14:30.744
- Kenny, Kenny!
- I'll fucking kill you!

14:30.745 --> 14:32.413
- Where is she?
- I can't! I can't!

14:32.414 --> 14:34.790
[Boyd] All right! All right!
Everybody out!

14:34.791 --> 14:36.458
- Hey! Just relax!
- Out! Out! Outside!

14:36.459 --> 14:37.793
[Boyd] Everybody, now!
Let's go!

14:37.794 --> 14:40.212
No. He knows where
she is, all right?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.673
- I can't just let him sit there!
- I know. I know. Just breathe.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.216
No. I don't need
to fucking breathe!

14:44.217 --> 14:47.094
- What I need is to find my wife!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.221
We're gonna find out
everything that he knows.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.181
I just need you to calm down.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.100
What he said about the baby,

14:53.101 --> 14:56.562
about how big Fatima's gotten,
do you think it's true?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.064
I don't know, Donna.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.525
[Sara]
He's not gonna tell you!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.612
I know what it's like to have
this place in your head.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.531
If he really believes what he's
saying is gonna save everyone,

15:07.532 --> 15:10.076
he's not gonna tell you
where she is.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.081
Where do you keep your tools?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.584
- Boyd.
- Where?

15:18.835 --> 15:22.129
The shed.
They're in the shed.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.213
Whoa. Boyd.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.758
You stay by the door.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.636
He doesn't come out.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.182
No one...
goes back in that room.

15:33.183 --> 15:36.102
[dramatic music playing]

15:42.233 --> 15:43.193
Victor.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.781
Uh, how are things
going with, uh, Jasper?

15:48.782 --> 15:52.369
Did he say anything
interesting so far?

15:54.663 --> 15:56.373
It's just a doll.
You were right.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.502
Dolls don't talk.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.129
Oh.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.884
Look. I... [sighs]

16:08.885 --> 16:12.137
I-I-I just wanted to say,

16:12.138 --> 16:15.141
I'm sorry I haven't
been more help.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.604
All this--
it's been a lot for me.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.440
But that's no excuse.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.362
- From now on--
- I have to show you something.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.573
Okay.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.867
It's gonna make you angry.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.786
It's--it's gonna
make you hate me.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.287
What?

16:37.288 --> 16:39.707
But I have to show you.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.168
And then we'll be done.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.503
Uh, done with what?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.921
It's this way.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.716
Okay, okay, okay.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.569
- You really gonna do this?
- [sighs]

17:10.572 --> 17:12.489
I don't got time
for you today.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.366
What comes first?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.826
You gonna use the saw
or the hammer?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.911
Oh, you know what
you should do?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.872
You should go old school.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.500
Get yourself some pliers and rip
his fingernails right off.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.461
Well, if that's what
it takes.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.379
You really don't see
the irony, do you?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.506
What the fuck are you
talking about?

17:29.507 --> 17:31.842
Oh, I don't know.
When Fatima killed Tillie,

17:31.843 --> 17:33.677
you didn't even blink.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.679
I mean, you did everything
you could to protect her.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.972
You took her
out to the shed.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.850
You lied to the people
you claim to care about.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.935
Hell, Kenny's
in there right now.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.520
He still doesn't
know what she did.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.607
What happened
wasn't her fault.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.986
Okay, and tell me how that's
any different with Elgin.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.864
I mean, this place
got inside his head,

17:53.865 --> 17:56.241
made him think
he was doing something good.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.203
Convinced him he was
actually protecting Fatima.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.749
And now, you're out here getting
ready to go medieval on him.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.542
Bit of a double standard,
don't you think?

18:05.543 --> 18:07.461
It's different.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.296
There's nothing
I could do about Tillie.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.673
Oh, bullshit. Tell yourself
anything you want, Boyd.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.218
I mean, you--
you walk around here

18:14.219 --> 18:16.470
like you're some
big knight in shining armor,

18:16.471 --> 18:19.473
Mr. Noble Sheriff.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.726
Push comes to shove, you're no
different than anyone else.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.270
You protect what's yours,
and you fuck anyone

18:25.271 --> 18:27.815
who gets in your way. You were
supposed to be better than this.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.025
Hey, you were
supposed to be here!

18:30.026 --> 18:32.027
You were--

18:32.028 --> 18:35.447
You and I were supposed
to figure this out together!

18:35.448 --> 18:37.574
You were the one who went
in the fucking street

18:37.575 --> 18:39.034
and got his throat slit!

18:39.035 --> 18:40.912
So, don't you come in here
and judge--

18:42.872 --> 18:44.706
You don't get to judge me.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.792
I'm doing the best I can.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.295
You know there's no coming
back from this, right?

18:51.548 --> 18:54.467
You said that you weren't gonna
let this place break you.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.679
But if you do this,

18:58.680 --> 19:00.681
this place has won.

19:00.682 --> 19:06.562
And if I don't... uh...

19:06.563 --> 19:09.773
my daughter-in-law dies.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.609
Well, that's why they call it
a rock and a hard place,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.487
not a rock and a soft,
comfy pillow.

19:16.573 --> 19:20.534
You need to decide right now
who you are,

19:20.535 --> 19:24.998
because that's who you're
gonna be from now on.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.979
Someone open this door!

19:48.980 --> 19:50.981
Please! [sobbing]

19:50.982 --> 19:54.027
[panting]

19:57.447 --> 19:58.405
[clattering]

19:58.406 --> 20:01.367
[continues panting]

20:12.795 --> 20:15.631
- [screams]
- [shatters]

20:15.632 --> 20:18.593
[panting]

20:30.438 --> 20:32.106
[ominous music playing]

20:44.243 --> 20:47.121
[inhales sharply, groans]

20:48.957 --> 20:49.915
[panting]

20:49.916 --> 20:51.959
What are we doing here?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.002
I thought maybe
there was a reason

20:54.003 --> 20:56.713
they came out to you here.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.173
Look. The only thing
tying together

20:58.174 --> 21:00.968
all the crazy
that we've seen, right--

21:00.969 --> 21:03.887
me, you, Miranda--the--
the one point of overlap

21:03.888 --> 21:06.056
in all our Venn diagrams
of crazy--

21:06.057 --> 21:07.141
Is the children.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.185
Wait.
You've seen them too?

21:10.186 --> 21:11.770
In the cavern.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.064
They were laying on these--
these slabs of rock,

21:14.065 --> 21:15.732
saying that word,
that "Anghkooey."

21:15.733 --> 21:16.733
- Yeah.
- "Anghkooey,"

21:16.734 --> 21:18.735
over and over again.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.029
And I looked up.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.783
There was this hole
in the ceiling.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.705
And there was this mass
of--of--of roots,

21:29.706 --> 21:32.124
this tangle forming
that fucking symbol.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.792
The roots of the tree.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.086
What'd you say?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.213
The Boy in White--
Victor heard him.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.591
He said when the kids
were on the stones,

21:41.592 --> 21:45.762
they poured their hopes into
the roots that made the symbol,

21:45.763 --> 21:47.682
and then those roots
became the tree.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.809
Is it the bottle tree?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.812
Uh, yeah, I think so.

21:53.813 --> 21:58.984
Okay. So the, uh,
creepy kids

21:58.985 --> 22:01.528
made a magic tree.

22:01.529 --> 22:05.574
And the symbol that has been

22:05.575 --> 22:08.161
plaguing me this whole time...
[chuckles]

22:10.079 --> 22:11.831
[Jade laughing]

22:15.084 --> 22:18.629
You could have just
fucking told me!

22:20.631 --> 22:21.965
- You didn't have to--
- Jade. Jade.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.759
No, no! I am sick--

22:23.760 --> 22:25.927
I am sick and tired
of getting dicked around!

22:25.928 --> 22:29.181
If you really want our help,

22:29.182 --> 22:31.892
if there is something
you need us to understand,

22:31.893 --> 22:34.227
you're gonna have
to do a little better,

22:34.228 --> 22:36.521
because we are not
getting it!

22:36.522 --> 22:39.650
You hear me? Message is
not fucking received!

22:41.736 --> 22:45.655
So, we're gonna sit here,
and we're gonna wait.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.824
And when you decide

22:47.825 --> 22:50.535
that you have
something more to say

22:50.536 --> 22:54.539
than fucking "Anghkooey,"

22:54.540 --> 22:55.833
you know where to find us!

23:03.591 --> 23:04.674
You feel better now?

23:04.675 --> 23:06.719
No. Not really.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.306
[grunting]

23:11.307 --> 23:13.642

[inhales sharply]

23:39.043 --> 23:40.586
[groans]

23:41.629 --> 23:43.213
You're not giving yourself
time to heal.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.882
Well, Fatima's still out there.
I can't just sit here.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.218
I'm gonna get
some fresh gauze.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.596
You were really quiet
last night,

23:51.597 --> 23:52.848
after they brought Julie in.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.307
I just felt bad.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.227
- I mean, she's--
- [clattering]

23:57.228 --> 23:58.771
Uh, Randall?

24:01.732 --> 24:03.191
Hey, what happened
to your bandage?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.068
It fell off.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.237
Uh, where's the stuff from
the ambulance, the new stuff?

24:07.238 --> 24:09.239
- It's in the cabinets.
- No, not the medicine.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.658
The equipment.
Where did you put the equipment?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.243
There's a supply closet
downstairs. We--

24:13.244 --> 24:15.996
- Great.
- [Marielle] Randall.

- Hey, hey, hey!

24:57.955 --> 24:59.956
- [Randall grunts]
- Hey!

24:59.957 --> 25:02.334
I'm trying to make
it fucking stop!

25:02.335 --> 25:03.835
- Hey!
- [grunting]

25:03.836 --> 25:07.005
Hey! Look at me! Hey!

25:07.006 --> 25:10.258
- Look at me. Hey, hey.
- [panting]

25:10.259 --> 25:12.260
- You're gonna be okay.
- [panting]

25:12.261 --> 25:15.430
You're gonna be all right.
Come here.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.408
- Dad, just--
- Nobody comes upstairs.

25:36.077 --> 25:39.288
- You make sure of that, okay?
- Yeah.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.251
What happens next...

25:44.252 --> 25:47.170
that's on me.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.091
[footsteps ascend stairs]

25:54.887 --> 25:55.971
Boyd.
