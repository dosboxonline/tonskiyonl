and we are stuck.

You're telling me
I'm in a town I can't leave

monsters come from the forest.

I can't have kids.

[Tabitha] I saw something
that wasn't there.

01:19.455 --> 01:21.373
- What?
- I saw two children,

01:24.543 --> 01:26.212

happened,

[continues screaming]

01:34.553 --> 01:37.223
What if the only way to save
Julie is to find that tower?

01:37.223 --> 01:38.891
- Tabby...
- I have to try this, Jim.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.059

01:40.059 --> 01:43.145
It's a Faraway tree. Here.

01:45.523 --> 01:48.442
My mother said it would take her
to the tower, to the children.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.073
Every time I see something
really weird, I see this symbol.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.659

symbol down in the tunnels.

you went into the forest.

gonna help me fix this.

feeds the forest, Boyd.

It's hope.

on the side of a trail.

You're in Camden.

without any identification.

Now that you're awake, I'd also
like to run a few tests,

Would that be all right?

What's goin' on?

13:59.881 --> 14:01.341
I'm gonna go look
for my wife.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.803
All right, wait,
just hold on a second.

14:04.803 --> 14:09.349
If you're gonna go, there might
be a safer way to do this.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.643
[coughing]

14:11.643 --> 14:13.478
[pounding on door]

14:13.478 --> 14:15.730
Come on! You've been in there
almost an hour already!

14:15.730 --> 14:17.148
Just give me a second.

14:17.148 --> 14:21.236
You said that 15 minutes ago!
Come on!

14:21.236 --> 14:23.822
[gasps]

14:23.822 --> 14:25.532
[indistinct conversations]

14:25.532 --> 14:28.201
I can't wait any longer!

14:31.162 --> 14:33.373
[pounding on door]

14:35.625 --> 14:37.210
[turns off faucet]

14:38.253 --> 14:40.088
Hurry up!
What are you doing in there?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.429
[pounding on door]

14:52.475 --> 14:54.519
It's bad enough you're
getting double rations

14:54.519 --> 14:56.521
without you hogging
the bathroom.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.607
Whoa. Back off, Nicky.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.858
Eat shit, Clara.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.568
Hey, is there a problem?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.446
Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm about to piss on the floor.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.533
Screw her.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.035
[door locking]

15:10.035 --> 15:11.369
[Ellis] You doing okay?

15:11.369 --> 15:12.996
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.042
Baby, you really
gotta eat something.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.127
I will. I just...

15:19.127 --> 15:21.921
My stomach
just hasn't been right.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.214
I just gotta rest.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.092
There's two of you
I gotta worry about now.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.262
I'll be okay.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.396
The first couple of months
can be hard, but...

15:38.396 --> 15:40.607
- Yeah.
- ...she'll be all right.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.988
Ellis, we've got work
to do.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.075
Isn't it too soon
to harvest?

15:50.075 --> 15:52.494
We've already lost
half our crop to the storm.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.080
I don't wanna risk losing
what little we have left,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.290
hoping the ground
doesn't freeze.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.086
Has he slept yet?

16:01.086 --> 16:02.962
[sighs] I don't know.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.923
[sighs]

16:04.923 --> 16:06.591
We got bigger
things to deal with.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.636
Round up some bodies.
Meet me out in the field.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.599
The day that Sara and I found
the lighthouse in the woods,

16:14.599 --> 16:16.935
we started out
at the little stone hut

16:16.935 --> 16:18.645
where I found the talismans.

16:18.645 --> 16:23.274
We were also in a tent that got
dragged who knows where.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.694
But if you start out
in the hut each morning,

16:25.694 --> 16:29.447
you're at least starting closer
to what you're trying to find,

16:29.447 --> 16:30.990
and you've got a place
to come back to at night,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.617
so you don't
get yourself killed.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.328
Makes sense. Thanks.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.456
Uh, wait. You said you and Sara
both made camp in there?

16:38.456 --> 16:40.333
Yeah. Why?

16:41.751 --> 16:43.211
I'm gonna go with him.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.089
Can I talk to you outside?

16:50.719 --> 16:53.888
Hey. Hey!

16:53.888 --> 16:55.473
[sighs]

16:55.473 --> 16:58.476
Look, look, I know what
you're gonna say, okay?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.812
But there's no way we can
let him go out there alone.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.648
I get-- I get why
you're afraid to go back--

17:03.648 --> 17:06.568
- I am not afraid--
- Yes! Yes, you are,

17:06.568 --> 17:10.321
and you've got a lot
of reasons to be, Boyd.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.574
[sighs] But someone's
gotta make sure

17:12.574 --> 17:14.325
that Jim comes back
in one piece.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.702
I know what it's like
to lose a parent here,

17:15.702 --> 17:17.704
and I'm not gonna
watch Julie and Ethan

17:17.704 --> 17:20.039
lose both their parents
in the same week.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.711
We can't play
defense forever, Boyd.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.631
What the fuck?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.052
What the fuck is...

17:39.017 --> 17:40.602
Jade?

17:40.602 --> 17:42.687
[Jade]
They tried to show me.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.356
I don't see it.

17:45.356 --> 17:49.068
I can't see it. I can't see it.
[muttering]

17:50.361 --> 17:52.113
They tried to show me.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.865
What's he talking about?

17:53.865 --> 17:55.533
No idea.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.702
- [Jade] I don't understand it.
- Did you know about this?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.412
[Jade]
They're trying to show me.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.123
I mean, I knew he was pretty
obsessed with that drawing,

18:02.123 --> 18:04.209
but this is... insane.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.044
I can't... I can't see it.

18:06.044 --> 18:10.173
I can't... Fuck.
I can't see it.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.051
Yeah,
I'll get that boarded up.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.385
- No.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.262
Help me take him
back to the station.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.389
- He can sleep it off.
- [Jade] I can't see it.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.058
- I can't...
- I'm gonna help you, buddy.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.309
- No, no.
- [Boyd] No, no, no, no.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.978
[Kenny] It's all right. Hey!
Let's do this.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.563
- I gotta see... I gotta...
- No, no.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.482
- I gotta figure this out!
- Just stand up.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.484
- Ready?
- [groaning]

18:29.484 --> 18:33.279
[indistinct conversations]

18:45.333 --> 18:48.837
It's so cute.
It's amazing, like...

18:48.837 --> 18:50.171
Look at this.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.551
[girl]
Oh, that's really cute.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.513
[camera clicking]

18:58.513 --> 19:00.473
Let me get one
of the two of us.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.145
[camera shutter clicking]

19:06.145 --> 19:08.439
- What's wrong?
- [Tabitha] Excuse me.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.024
Hi.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.778
Um, would it be possible for me
to borrow one of your phones?

19:13.778 --> 19:14.779
Um, no.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.655
Please.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.533
- Will you be quick?
- Yeah.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.827
Thank you.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.330
[quietly]
Why would you do that?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.545
Okay.

19:31.546 --> 19:35.800
[phone line ringing]

19:35.800 --> 19:37.176
[woman] <i>Hello?</i>

19:38.887 --> 19:40.388
Mom?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.473
<i>Tabby? Oh, God! Tabby!
Where are you?</i>

19:42.473 --> 19:46.519
Mom, hi. Uh...
I'm okay. We're all okay.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.646
<i>Ay, mija!</i>

19:48.646 --> 19:50.356
Yeah.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.192
<i>Where have you been?</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:55.320
Um...

19:55.320 --> 19:57.864
we had to go for
a little while, but, um...

19:57.864 --> 19:59.198
<i>And you went where?</i>

19:59.198 --> 20:01.200
I-I just don't want
you to worry, Mom.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.494
<i>No, Tabby, the police
are looking for you</i>

20:03.494 --> 20:06.039
<i>and Jim and the kids.
Everybody's been looking!</i>

20:06.039 --> 20:07.582
I know. I know, Mom. I know.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.667
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
<i>- Ay, mi amor.</i>

20:09.667 --> 20:13.004
I-- I... I'm gonna tell you
everything as soon as I see you.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.505
<i>Please!</i> Por favor!

20:14.505 --> 20:15.840
I just...

20:15.840 --> 20:18.009
<i>We have been so worried!</i>

20:18.009 --> 20:21.054
I just wanted to hear your voice
and for you to hear mine.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.513
<i>Tabby!</i>

20:22.513 --> 20:25.183
Mom, I love you so much,
and I miss you and...

20:25.183 --> 20:26.851
<i>Ah, mi amor!</i>

20:26.851 --> 20:30.188
Jim and I are doing everything
we can to come back home soon.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.356
<i>Ay, que bueno.</i>

20:31.356 --> 20:32.941
Everyone says hello.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.859
<i>Ay, Tabby, please,
just stay on the phone.</i>

20:34.859 --> 20:36.361
No, no, no.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.529
<i>There's a police detective.
He gave me his card.</i>

20:38.529 --> 20:40.865
Mom, Mom, I-I...
I can't stay here for long.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.075
I'm sorry. Um...

20:42.075 --> 20:44.202
<i>Okay, but you have
to call him.</i>

20:44.202 --> 20:46.704
- Uh...
<i>- Mi amor!</i>

20:46.704 --> 20:49.374
You might not hear from me
for a little bit, but...

20:49.374 --> 20:51.876
<i>No, no, no! No, no, no!
You have to stay here!</i>

20:51.876 --> 20:54.212
I just don't
want you to be afraid.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.880
I'm okay, okay?
Everything's okay.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.215
<i>¿Ay, pero cuándo?</i>

20:57.215 --> 20:58.716
- I love you, Mom.
<i>- Tabby!</i>

20:58.716 --> 21:00.969
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I-I have to go.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.638
I love you so much, okay?
Everything's okay.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.640
[sobbing]
Mom, I love you. Bye.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.231
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.899
Why would you do that?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.776
You seriously need to
disinfect your phone now.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.784
[breathing heavily]

21:29.163 --> 21:30.581
[exhaling sharply]

21:30.581 --> 21:34.419
[church bells
tolling in distance]

21:34.419 --> 21:36.796
[church bells tolling]

21:36.796 --> 21:38.423
[Kristi]
When are you guys leaving?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.633
[Kenny]
As soon as Jim's ready.

21:41.884 --> 21:45.930
My mom insisted on putting
together our rations.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.598
Yeah, Moms'll do that.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.808
Yep.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.310
Are you sure
about all this?

21:52.437 --> 21:54.439
\Mom, that's too much.
We can't...

21:54.439 --> 21:57.650
[in Cantonese]

22:02.780 --> 22:03.823
Ma...

22:05.366 --> 22:06.659
[Kenny] Yes.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.042
[in Cantonese]

22:15.960 --> 22:17.545
It's gonna be fine!

22:17.545 --> 22:19.839
You guys worry too much.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.684
Are you really
gonna go find Mom?

22:33.811 --> 22:36.314
Well, I'm gonna do my best.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.899
But I can't do that

22:37.899 --> 22:39.734
if I'm worried
about things back here.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.153
So, no more running off, okay?

22:42.153 --> 22:44.697
Okay.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.867
Shake on it.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.452
Good man.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.708
I love you, Dad.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.044
I love you, too.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.420
Promise you'll be careful?

23:05.343 --> 23:06.886
I promise.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.394
I'll be back soon.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.776
- Yeah.
- You got it. Okay.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.362
You ready?
We're burning daylight.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.780
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.574
Right, and remember what I
told you about those trees.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.785
You start seeing spiderwebs,
then you know you are going

23:30.785 --> 23:32.370
- in the right direction.
- Yeah, got it.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.373
And whatever you do, make sure
you get back to the hut by dark.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.625
Yeah.
We're gonna be okay.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.710
Okay?
I'll see you soon.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.462
Okay.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.716
Hey! Dad!

23:45.716 --> 23:47.593
Wha...?

23:47.593 --> 23:50.763
You gotta come to the fields!
Come on!

23:52.140 --> 23:53.724
[man] Let's see what
we can dig up...

23:53.724 --> 23:56.727
[breathing heavily]

23:56.727 --> 24:00.648
No, no. Please.
What are we gonna do?

24:00.648 --> 24:02.150
They're all fuckin' rotten!

24:02.150 --> 24:03.317
[gasps]

24:03.317 --> 24:05.153
[groans]

24:05.153 --> 24:07.280
[grunts]

24:07.280 --> 24:08.781
[Boyd]
Donna!

24:11.325 --> 24:12.618
First things we pulled up,

24:12.618 --> 24:16.914
it was a few rotten carrots,
beets and potatoes.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.459
So, we pulled up some more.
They were rotten too.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.130
Everything that survived
the storm is rotten.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.801
Boyd, we're out of food.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.096
How many people did you
have up here with you?

24:32.096 --> 24:33.764
Donna!

24:33.764 --> 24:35.474
How many people know?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.269
- [shouting indistinctly]
- Go! You go home now!

24:38.269 --> 24:39.520
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

24:39.520 --> 24:40.938
But every ounce of
food we have left

24:40.938 --> 24:42.857
is in those jars
in your basement!

24:42.857 --> 24:45.651
You have no right to keep
it locked away down there!

24:45.651 --> 24:46.485
No!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.112
Those for everybody!

24:48.112 --> 24:49.655
There more crop coming!

24:49.655 --> 24:51.449
You don't know what
you're talking about.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.491
Everything else is rotten!

24:52.491 --> 24:54.202
This is all
the food we have now!

24:54.202 --> 24:55.286
No!

24:55.286 --> 24:56.829
Please go home!

24:56.829 --> 24:58.289
Go home!

24:58.289 --> 25:00.499
No, my house! No!

25:00.499 --> 25:02.001
Come on.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.669
What are you doing?

25:03.669 --> 25:06.881
You're not-- look, kid, I don't
like this any more than you do,
