Not now, lois. It's time
for my favorite holiday movie,

00:41.751 --> 00:43.042
<i> Frosty the snowman,</i>

00:43.169 --> 00:45.419
Where a hero takes a little girl
into the woods

00:45.546 --> 00:49.006
And then brags that he
can disappear whenever he wants.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.552
Huh. I can't see the tv.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.887
I must be dreaming.

Yeah, and why was<i> that</i>
your first move?

01:03.481 --> 01:05.647
The tv's gone.
We're cutting the cord.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.150
We need money for
christmas gifts, so I sold it.

01:18.621 --> 01:20.996
Could you please point me
to your blandest shirt?

01:21.123 --> 01:23.624
One that I'm guaranteed
to see four other guys wearing

01:23.709 --> 01:24.958

01:25.127 --> 01:26.502
Sure, it's right over there.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.795
Just be careful
while you're browsing

this seems like a big change,

01:41.185 --> 01:43.227
But we don't need
a television anymore.

01:43.312 --> 01:46.021
Yeah, dad.
A single tv console is outdated.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.565
Everyone just streams now
on their individual devices.

By making
a very old movie reference!

02:06.168 --> 02:07.626
Peter, meg was right.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.712
We don't need a tv
in the golden age of streaming.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.089
"golden age of streaming"?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.841
Look, my streams are sporadic
at best.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.342
And last week, there was blood.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.012
Can we have one holiday where
we don't discuss dad's rod?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.265
Besides, all my shows
are on network television.

to watch<i> chicago fire</i>

02:23.727 --> 02:25.269
-Without a tv?
-Who cares?

02:25.396 --> 02:27.104
It's a lazy, formulaic show.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.106
And it's not even filmed
in chicago.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.607
Yeah, right.
Tell that to the boys

02:30.734 --> 02:31.984

Peter, stop it.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.866
God, you're going in circles,

02:38.951 --> 02:40.576
Like a desert vulture.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.661
Hey, maybe we shouldn't
always fly in a circle.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.706
Sure. And maybe I can also have
rough sex with your mother.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.124
Whoa! Come on.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.751

I'll miss without a tv.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.146
Lois is right, peter.
Network television stinks.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.856
Streaming is
way more entertaining.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.108
Yeah? Name one good show
on "streaming."

03:13.194 --> 03:14.234

03:23.829 --> 03:26.205
Look, come on, just-just give
streaming a chance.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.664
Don't you want
to watch something where,

03:27.750 --> 03:30.709
If you miss even a second,
you're hopelessly confused?

03:30.794 --> 03:33.036
Yeah! Or a great premise,

03:33.088 --> 03:34.922
Which puts a lot of balls
in the air,

03:35.049 --> 03:37.123
Followed by
a horribly disappointing ending

03:37.176 --> 03:38.342

And on hbo max,

03:39.595 --> 03:40.886
Sometimes after the credits,

03:40.971 --> 03:42.888
You can watch
the actors talk about the show.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.266

That he doesn't walk
the right way.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.779
Hmm. I may have to side
with peter now.

03:58.864 --> 03:59.863
And you also haven't told me

03:59.949 --> 04:01.406
About a single show

04:01.492 --> 04:03.367

I want to know,

04:03.494 --> 04:04.534
Is there a sheldon

04:04.662 --> 04:06.119
And at what stage of life is he?

04:06.288 --> 04:09.039
He is the perfect dumb guy's
version of a smart guy.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.999
And I demand him
on my television!

04:11.126 --> 04:14.544
All right. I think I see
how to untangle this knot.

Peter, the point of tv
isn't joy anymore.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.991
It's to destroy you emotionally.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.659
Who the hell wants
to watch something happy

04:45.744 --> 04:47.911

Oh, yeah? Name 50 more.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.721
[sighs heavily]

08:34.806 --> 08:36.556
<i> Silver spoons, the odd couple,</i>

08:36.642 --> 08:37.807
<i> The new odd couple...</i>

08:37.893 --> 08:39.100
<i> -Diff'rent strokes</i> and--
-[creaking]

08:39.269 --> 08:41.686
Oh, my god! She hung herself!

08:41.730 --> 08:42.938
Nah, nah, that's from<i> airplane.</i>

08:43.106 --> 08:44.481
We do that kind of stuff, too.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.024
You can stay.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.521
Family, meet kevin.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.906
Wow!

08:52.991 --> 08:55.367
I guess black dress shirts
aren't just for magicians.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.828
[quietly] peter, you can't
just invite him to stay here.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.830
Come on, lois.
When you got rid of the tv,

09:00.916 --> 09:02.207
Did you really think
it wouldn't end

09:02.292 --> 09:04.042
With me bunking
with kevin james?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.878
So, kevin,
what's mandy patinkin like?

09:06.964 --> 09:08.797
Uh, I don't know. Never met him.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.383
I thought you said
this guy was a [bleep] star.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.218
Hey, brian, when are you going
to try to impress

09:13.387 --> 09:15.679
Our hollywood guest
with your writerly chops?

09:15.764 --> 09:18.473
Uh, your mouth's moving!
You're already rehearsing it.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.476
So, kevin, the hollywood game
can be pretty tough, huh?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.687
Do you have
hollywood experience?

09:23.814 --> 09:25.689
[chuckling]
well, actually--

09:25.816 --> 09:27.482
He sure does!
We went out there once,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.442
And on day one,
brian bit a culkin.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.528
Tried to pet him
without showing his hand first

09:31.613 --> 09:32.904
And, boom, fingers gone.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.114
I need to see the hand!

09:34.199 --> 09:35.574
It's how I know
he's not an aggressor.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.158
Kevin, I don't understand.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.660
How can you be out of work?

09:38.829 --> 09:40.412
You're not just
a television actor--

09:40.497 --> 09:41.871
You're a movie star!

09:41.957 --> 09:43.999
Movie star?
[chuckles] come on.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.835
I mean, I guess
<i>paul blart</i> did make 200 million

09:46.962 --> 09:48.336
On a shoestring budget,

09:48.463 --> 09:50.755
I<i> was</i> the single most bankable
comedy actor

09:50.841 --> 09:52.382
Of the last two decades

09:52.467 --> 09:55.635
And the audience score on
<i>grown ups</i> was very respectable.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.513
Eh, the last one doesn't seem to
measure up with the first two.

09:58.599 --> 10:02.434
But everything I had was because
people knew me from network tv.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.935
And now that's over.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.187
So, peter, what are we gonna do
after dinner?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.814
Get a large bowl of popcorn

10:07.941 --> 10:10.817
And watch the big game
in our sports uniforms?

10:10.986 --> 10:12.235
Yeah, kevin, uh, I think

10:12.321 --> 10:14.863
You've only watched
sporting events on tv shows.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.364
Nobody calls it "the big game"

10:16.450 --> 10:18.533
Or makes
a large bowl of popcorn.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.327
But then what's gonna fly
all over the place

10:20.412 --> 10:22.037
-When we get excited?
-[giggles]

10:22.122 --> 10:23.872
Okay. A-all right, all right,
that's fair.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.041
All right, look,
kevin can stay for dinner,

10:26.126 --> 10:27.208
But then he has to leave.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.877
But he doesn't have
anywhere else to go!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.462
And this whole thing
is our fault.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.380
Come on, look at him--
he's got no idea

10:32.466 --> 10:34.633
What life outside of sitcoms
is like.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.636
I tell you what-- I'll show him
how to be a<i> real</i> real guy

10:37.763 --> 10:39.638
And not just a sitcom real guy,

10:39.765 --> 10:41.473
And then he'll be on his way.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.016
[sighs]
fine.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.101
I guess I can't kick someone out
on christmas.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.062
But where's he gonna sleep?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.938
Don't worry.
I got that all figured out.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.940
You won't even notice
he's there.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.318
-[snoring]
-[canned laughter]

10:55.280 --> 10:57.947
In network tv,
what someone says won't happen,

10:58.033 --> 10:59.574
That's what's gonna happen.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.493
[canned laughter]

11:07.709 --> 11:09.084
Hey, where's kevin?
I thought we were gonna show him

11:09.169 --> 11:10.210
How regular guys drink.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.920
We are, but he's still
adjusting,

11:11.963 --> 11:13.838
And he won't enter a room
until his warm-up guy

11:13.882 --> 11:14.872
Works the crowd.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.841
-So, where you folks from?
-Quahog.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.218
[chuckles] oh, quahog.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.969
I'll talk a little slower.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.971
-Aw, he got me.
-I'm just kidding.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.140
And, hey, thank you
for your service.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.809
Oh, I was never in the military.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.311
I was talking to the booth
holding you up.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.439
Oh, damn it, he got me again!
This guy's too quick.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.483
All right, everyone, kevin's
gonna be out in a moment,

11:33.568 --> 11:36.528
So remember,
he feeds off your energy.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.781
So the better you are,
the better kevin's gonna be.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.242
Hi, guys.
Great to see you tonight.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.370
Wait, he couldn't just
think of that?

11:45.497 --> 11:48.581
And doesn't peter griffin
look handsome?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.417
I took the cue cards.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.961
I grabbed him
from behind too hard,

11:53.088 --> 11:54.587
And now he's not moving.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.426
Hey, kevin, was that lady
always pressuring you

11:59.511 --> 12:00.760
To join scientology?

12:00.846 --> 12:03.513
No. I'm a devout catholic,
and that's even weirder.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.141
Did you know that when
unbaptized babies die,

12:06.268 --> 12:08.727
They go into limbo
until the pope said

12:08.812 --> 12:10.228
That wasn't a thing anymore?

12:10.355 --> 12:13.356
Yeah, my grandpa went to hell
for eating meat on fridays.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.693
Worth it.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.239
Well, kevin,
it's time to teach you

12:21.324 --> 12:24.659
How real blue-collar guys
pay real bills in real life.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.536
See this? It's a mortgage bill.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.747
And this is how it gets paid.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.457
Mr. Pewterschmidt, it's peter.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.917
-Please pay my mortgage.
-[carter]<i> damn it, griffin!</i>

12:33.003 --> 12:35.086
I'm crying, mr. Pewterschmidt,
I'm crying.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.088
<i> I know you're crying.</i>
<i> Act like a man.</i>

12:37.174 --> 12:39.549
I can't. I'm not a man.
And if you don't pay it,

12:39.593 --> 12:42.010
I'm gonna hurt myself
and your grandchildren.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.262
<i> -Stop threatening me.</i>
-It's not a threat if I do it.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.097
It's not a threat if I do it.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.141
<i> -Okay, okay, I'll pay it.</i>
-Thank you.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.436
All right, now to show you
how to pay a utility bill.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.812
[phone ringing]

12:52.898 --> 12:55.106
-Hello?
-Kevin, it's peter.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.358
I really messed up, man.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.531
Good news.
I got my first real job

13:03.700 --> 13:05.200
As an actual ups guy.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.993
They said I was
the last non-robot

13:07.120 --> 13:08.453
They're ever gonna hire.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.829
That's great, buddy.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.915
You narrowly escaped
becoming a realtor.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.959
Hi. Are you the realtor
for this property?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.045
I am. I blew out my shoulder

13:17.130 --> 13:19.881
Playing minor league baseball,
so now I do this.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.967
[announcer]
<i>realtors: Never anyone's plan a.</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:24.594
And I also started
dating a woman

13:24.679 --> 13:27.180
Who looks like she actually
belongs with me.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.475
She has the most negative
dating app page I've ever seen.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.560
"wants to know where
all the good men are.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.772
Integrity only.
I will not cosign a loan,"

13:35.899 --> 13:37.190
With the "not" underlined.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.984
And a picture of her dog
that says, "the only man

13:40.070 --> 13:42.153
Who's never lied to me."
oh, this is great.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.573
Yeah, I think I'm a real
real guy now, peter.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.283
You sure are. You see, kev,

13:47.410 --> 13:49.202
Nothing's gonna stop you
in the real world

13:49.329 --> 13:51.955
Except for your own
cardiovascular system.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.374
Hey, I'm only heavy 'cause
adam sandler made me

13:54.459 --> 13:56.584
Gain 60 pounds
to be in his movies.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.378
I was ethel to his lucy.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.714
Anyway, I owe you, peter.
Put it there.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.844
Aah! What happened to your hand?

14:05.929 --> 14:09.848
I-I don't know.
It-it's disappearing.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.141
Were you also bit by brian?

14:12.227 --> 14:14.352
[laughs] that's the culkin.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.735
Let me guess,
one of you chuckleheads

14:22.863 --> 14:24.487
Has a nutcracker inside you.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.322
-What? No.
-Hi.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.867
We're nonjudgmental interns
just here to observe.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.285
False alarm. Not what I thought.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.911
[interns] aww.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.246
Whenever interns observe,

14:33.373 --> 14:34.664
It's because we think
you put something in there.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.542
Listen, doctor, I need you
to help my friend kevin.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.460
Oh, my god, kevin james!

14:39.546 --> 14:41.504
You know, you owe
your career to me.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.549
I'm the doctor who couldn't
save john candy.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.135
Doctor, my hand,
it's disappearing,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.053
And I don't know what to do.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.307
Kevin, your arm.
It's getting worse.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.101
Hmm. I think I see
what's going on here.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.477
Kevin is fading away

14:56.605 --> 14:58.688
Because streaming has
made him irrelevant.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.398
Is there anything
we can do for him?

15:00.483 --> 15:03.359
Yes. Sitcom stars like kevin
clearly need the laughs

15:03.445 --> 15:05.987
Of a studio audience,
or he may disappear forever.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.989
His hair was disappearing, too,

15:08.033 --> 15:10.116
But I assume he took care
of that another way.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.868
Is there someone I can talk to?

15:11.953 --> 15:14.579
Ah, there's our guy. Interns!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.834
Guys, we gotta get kevin
back on tv.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.169
So ideas. Go.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.004
Kevin plays a large robot,

15:23.131 --> 15:25.131
And it's called<i> big wonder.</i>

15:25.216 --> 15:27.258
[laughs] not bad, not bad.
Okay, what else?

15:27.385 --> 15:30.678
A show in which kevin moves in
with a woman named betsy,

15:30.764 --> 15:34.098
And it's called<i> kevins to betsy.</i>

15:34.184 --> 15:36.809
Or he's the seventh
in a long line of kevins,

15:36.895 --> 15:37.977
For<i> seventh kevin.</i>

15:38.063 --> 15:39.354
Yeah, they don't all
have to be puns

15:39.439 --> 15:40.730
Built around the name kevin.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.816
Guys, I think we were all
laughing at<i> big wonder.</i>

15:43.902 --> 15:45.068
We're not doing<i> big wonder.</i>

15:45.195 --> 15:47.111
Why? Because you didn't
think of it?

15:47.238 --> 15:50.156
Chris, the brainstorming process
is admittedly messy,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.075
But let's try to stay away
from personal attacks.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.578
I have an idea. I'm a stepdad
with six daughters,

15:55.664 --> 15:58.373
And it's called<i> daddy's girls.</i>

15:58.458 --> 15:59.999
I don't know.
Not sure I see the hook.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.127
And I trick them into
washing my car in their bikinis

16:03.254 --> 16:05.088
While I hide in the backseat.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.381
Okay, now I love it.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.466
It's not just funny, it's smart.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.926
You know, I'm on godaddy,

16:10.095 --> 16:12.804
And the domain name "big wonder"
is available.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.181
-Chris, stop pushing this.
-Oh, really?

16:15.266 --> 16:18.017
'cause if kevin pitched it,
you'd put your mouth on him.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.645
All right, that's it.
You're grounded for life.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.147
Which was also a fat dad sitcom.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.316
[laughs]
okay, all right, we've made up.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.735
I've got an idea.
Kevin is a baker,

16:27.862 --> 16:29.195
And he adopts 12 children.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.697
The title writes itself.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.533
Yeah, and the tagline is
"he's got muffin to lose."

16:33.618 --> 16:35.827
Okay, wow, all right,
this is too good for kevin.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.412
We have to write this now.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.415
You know why he's a baker?
Because he<i> kneads</i> the<i> dough.</i>

16:40.500 --> 16:44.127
[laughs] I love this poster.
I mean show.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.338
Peter, my arm is
almost gone now.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.923
Oh, god, what are we gonna do?

16:49.050 --> 16:50.466
Okay, come on, everyone.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.969
It's time to go to city hall
for the tree lighting.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.972
And meg's in the nativity play
as the virgin mary.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.349
Wait a minute.
The nativity play.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.853
Kevin, I got an idea,
and it's my best idea

17:01.980 --> 17:03.855
Since I put hockey ice
in the kitchen.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.232
-[timer dings]
-yay, waffles.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.194
Mine. Hockey house.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.950
Everyone, change of plans.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.243
This year we're gonna do a twist

17:17.328 --> 17:19.245
On the usual story
of the king of kings,

17:19.405 --> 17:22.582
With the "king of queens,"
kevin james.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.920
Peter, this isn't gonna work.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.338
Sure it will. The doctor said

17:29.382 --> 17:31.132
You need live audience laughter.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.926
The conceit is he's
a single dad with a baby.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.345
[laughs] the conception
may be immaculate,

17:36.389 --> 17:38.056
But the diaper sure isn't.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.475
-[booing]
-get off the stage.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.310
Network tv is stupid.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.812
Why does jerry stiller have
such a big chest?

17:44.898 --> 17:47.023
Peter, my leg.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.027
Come on, guys,
network tv isn't stupid.

17:51.112 --> 17:54.238
It-it's... It's like the bible.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.740
Sure, the plot doesn't
make sense

17:55.867 --> 17:56.949
If you think about it.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.409
The characters are a little
over the top.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.287
Both tell the same tired stories
again and again.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.247
No one ever seems
to learn their lesson.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.207
And neither ever offers

18:04.334 --> 18:05.958
An authentic female
point of view.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.668
Oh, if I can add to that--

18:07.754 --> 18:09.253
Not now, lois, I'm talking.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.256
But the point is, network tv...
It makes you feel good.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.218
And when the rest of life
is so exhausting and hard,

18:15.345 --> 18:17.845
Isn't that all that's important?

18:17.931 --> 18:19.430
Peter, my other leg!

18:20.433 --> 18:22.433
[soft laughter]

18:23.978 --> 18:25.520
Yes. Kevin, keep going.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.313
That went well.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.148
[laughter]

18:29.234 --> 18:31.150
Well, there's the star
of bethlehem,

18:31.236 --> 18:34.570
Which is one more star than
I'm giving this inn on yelp.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.947
[loud laughter]

18:36.032 --> 18:37.323
Oh, that's so funny.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.116
I use yelp.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.784
Do you think ben stiller's chest

18:39.869 --> 18:40.952
Will pop out like his dad's?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.703
I just want to know
what to expect.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.247
See, isn't this fun?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.958
Everyone laughing together
at the same simple thing,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.127
Instead of all of us
on our individual devices

18:49.254 --> 18:51.546
Watching depressing,
complicated bull crap?

18:51.631 --> 18:55.424
We need kevin james,
and we need network tv.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.485
It's old sitcom stars.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.070
They're coming out
of the cornfield.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.322

Traylor howard,

19:24.122 --> 19:25.037
Yeah, you're not a star.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.289
You shouldn't be
in the cornfield.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.250
But I was also in

19:39.679 --> 19:42.096
Kevin, I'm looking for
my own television comeback,

19:42.223 --> 19:45.349
And enough power that I can
sexually harass doctors again.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.977
-And I'm anyone else.
-I'll go with you.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.971
And to think I was
about to kiss you.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.399
Kevin, let's go make a sitcom.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.942
I can't believe it.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.986
I'm gonna be on tv again.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.031
I'm going back to hollywood.

Yes, peter, you can.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.503
Yay! Kiss me, lois.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.589
And think about our marriage

tagline-driven comedy

20:38.404 --> 20:40.071
-We're looking for.
-Really?

20:40.198 --> 20:42.448
The only problem is
we've already committed

20:42.533 --> 20:43.908
To another project:

<i> -Big wonder.</i>
-Thank you, gentlemen.

Fine. We don't need you.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.752
We'll take this down the hall
to scott rudin.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.671
[loud crash]

20:56.756 --> 20:58.214
He threw a computer at me.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.549
He didn't even ask who I was.
