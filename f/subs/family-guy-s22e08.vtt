into some cookie dough,

18:13.927 --> 18:17.136
And my tears actually made
the cookies taste incredible.

to cry anymore.

the reason you're happy

18:28.108 --> 18:29.690
Isn't because of the business?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.610

19:02.267 --> 19:04.684
Chris is right. We love you.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.520
Oh, I love you guys.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.192
Hey, where's that diploma from?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.944
Oh, that's not a diploma.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.238
That's a certificate for
finishing the big bertha

19:17.323 --> 19:19.615
At leo's bar and grill
in cincinnati.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.869
Got a t-shirt, too,
but it's at the dry cleaners.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.787
Wow. Dry cleaning a t-shirt

19:24.914 --> 19:27.415
Bragging about a regional
food challenge?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.584
That's the dream.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.882
Honey, it's me. They fell
for the whole crusher routine.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.925
Oh, and their little
cookie business?

19:38.011 --> 19:42.096
Let's just say I...
Took care of it.

19:47.136 --> 19:49.228
[sinister laughter]

19:50.815 --> 19:53.065
[sinister laughter]

19:53.818 --> 19:56.027
[sinister laughter]

19:57.530 --> 19:59.447
[sinister laughter]

20:00.909 --> 20:04.076
[siren wailing]

20:04.204 --> 20:05.786
What happened last night?

20:05.914 --> 20:08.080
Oh, nothing. Just...
Just hit a home run

20:08.208 --> 20:09.665
In my softball game.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.700
No, I mean,
I mean the building.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.086
Huh? Oh, huge gas leak.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.005
Won the game.
Everybody's dead.

20:21.596 --> 20:24.805
Sorry I got carried away with
my daytime talk show, lois.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.724
Oh, peter, I'm just glad
you're home

20:26.809 --> 20:29.310
And still wearing television
makeup for some reason.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.646
I don't know what you're
talking about.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.273
Hey, sorry your cookie business
didn't work out, meg.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.192
Yeah, I guess it would have
been pretty sweet

20:36.319 --> 20:39.028
To have a successful
cookie business, but it's fine.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.489
You know, meg, the way I see it,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.325
Life's too darn short.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.329
Boy, that was brutal.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.206
Yeah, what a big waste of time.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.251
I know, it's like life really is
too darn short.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.087
Huh. Maybe it was good.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.422
Screw it, I'm getting a shirt.
