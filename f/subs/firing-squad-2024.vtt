00:32.490 --> 00:34.284
Terry, the President has declined

00:34.284 --> 00:35.910
all last minute reprieves.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.372
So they will be executed
by Firing Squad tonight.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.713
Megan, Peter Lone, the one
time drug dealer turned pastor,

00:46.713 --> 00:48.131
along with two others,

00:48.131 --> 00:51.342
will be executed at 12
midnight, local time.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.139
The President has declined
all last minute reprieves.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.933
So they will be executed by firing squad.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.937
My name is Peter Lone

01:02.937 --> 01:04.689
and I'll be executed in two hours,

01:05.690 --> 01:07.901
but I'm at perfect peace.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.779
A reporter asked me
how I could be so calm.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.072
It's only the Lord Jesus Christ

01:12.072 --> 01:13.990
that will carry me to the end.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.410
So why am I being executed, you ask?

01:17.410 --> 01:21.498
Well, would you like the
long story or a short one?

01:25.877 --> 01:29.672
Before I found the Lord Jesus
Christ, I was a drug runner.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.549
I lived life in the fast life.

01:31.549 --> 01:36.429

01:36.429 --> 01:38.723

02:01.913 --> 02:03.248
Don't worry about us.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.708
Hey, you're
dead if you're caught.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.584
I'm just saying.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.215
We were inseparable,

02:12.215 --> 02:13.716
and traveled the entire world.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.933
We gambled everywhere in the world.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.310
Macau, Las Vegas, Monte Carlo.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.147
We lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.983
It was insane.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.277

02:52.714 --> 02:53.548

We're gonna party like it's 1999.

Remember that Prince song, honey?

03:01.055 --> 03:02.640
What?

03:02.640 --> 03:03.892
What's the matter?

03:05.018 --> 03:05.852
Nothing.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.563
I'm good.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.480
Yeah.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.982
We're gonna party.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.544
You are a drug dealer?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.004
What?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.088
Are you're a drug dealer?

03:34.088 --> 03:34.923
Drug dealer?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.424
No, I'm not a drug dealer.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.258
Go.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.566
Welcome, Liu.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.612
This is a nice house.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.031
This old man himself, didn't know he existed.

04:00.031 --> 04:00.865
Hey.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.327
Look,

04:05.161 --> 04:06.829
I think I'm taking a lot of heat.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.083
What do you mean?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.168
I think the cops are following me here.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.295
Why would you come here?

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
I had to take the chance.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.549
Yeah, but mate, that
puts us all at risk here.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.884
Come on, let's just get
this done and get it over.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.677
Come on.

04:26.724 --> 04:27.850
It’s missing a stack.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.189
Just ah...

04:33.189 --> 04:34.023
finder's fee.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.786
It's all here.

04:46.786 --> 04:47.829
Thanks.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.372
All right.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.124
So I'm gonna head over the mountains.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.125
Get to China.

04:53.042 --> 04:53.876
It's gonna be great.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.086
Wish me luck.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.796
So there's demand in China?

04:56.796 --> 04:57.630
Yeah.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.715
Wherever the money flows.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.925
Cocaine's like the new
God to these people.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.512
We don't believe in God,
so that's all right.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.972
Great, neither do I.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.227
Alright, let's check out of here.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.812
Let's go to the Shangri-La.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.646
I'm gonna go and get Karen.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.522
She's shopping downstairs.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.190
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.734
We flew from Bali to Hong Kong that day

05:17.734 --> 05:19.610
to escape any heat from the police.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.196
Even then, I still thought
we were invincible.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.657
We always stayed at the
five star Peninsula Hotel

05:24.657 --> 05:26.951
whenever we were in Hong Kong.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.870
Hey, I think we should
get outta here, man.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.413
Outta where?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.247
This country.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.167
Morgan, would you just relax.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.044
We've got a bag full of
cash, it's not drugs, okay?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.045
Yeah, I know that.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.254
I still want to go home.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.425
Do I have a
death wish, Morgan asked.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.301
Maybe I did.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.345
My upbringing, that was the death to me.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.306
You know, it's kind of funny.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.725
What's that?

05:50.725 --> 05:52.602
Every time we survive this gauntlet,

05:53.728 --> 05:56.189
one step closer to fulfilling
our own death wish.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.527
We stayed in Hong
Kong for another week

06:01.527 --> 06:02.445
and flew to Jakarta.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.696
We felt the heat was off

06:03.696 --> 06:04.989
But I never heard back from Liu Fat.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.365
I wondered if he was okay.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.078
The next day something strange happened.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.498
Someone came up to me and gave
me this flyer about Jesus.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.957
Hey, hey guys.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.294
Would you guys like to
take the good person test?

06:18.294 --> 06:19.128
What?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.798
Are you a good person?

06:21.798 --> 06:22.632
No.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.344
If you guys died today,
where would you guys go then?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.178
I don't know.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.054
How about none of your business?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.347
- Come on, kid.
- Get lost.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.599
Sorry to bother you guys.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.433
God bless.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.310
What a loser.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.521
They have these Jesus freaks in Jakarta.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.355
I guess so.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.109
I laughed and mocked Christians.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.735
I had no time for them.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.529
They were just losers in my book.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.781
Look Morgan, brother,

06:47.824 --> 06:48.658
I'm telling you mate.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.618
When we fly by private jet,
it just doesn't get caught.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.537
Private jet, you always got a plan, right?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.205
Mate, we give it to the tourists.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.623
That's why we never hold anything.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.041
They just let them off
with a slap on a wrist.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.292
Just trust me.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.919
You know, this one's too much.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.589
Look at me and tell me you
don't know this one's too much.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.341
Morgan, look, we'll leave tomorrow.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.175
Okay?

07:07.009 --> 07:08.094
I want out tonight.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.720
We've been doing this for five years.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.264
Not one bit of heat.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.098
Just chill.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.474
Please just relax on this.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.601
You know I'm right.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.895
Look at you, you know I'm right.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.360
The next morning we
raced to our private jet

07:24.360 --> 07:25.903
by way of a jeep.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.573
It was the fastest way to
get to the airport in Bali.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.033
I didn't feel right about things.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.828
But now we're finally
heading out of Indonesia,

07:33.828 --> 07:35.163
forever.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.499
Well guys, another day in paradise.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.918
Why do we have to leave so early again?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.962
Oh, we wrapped up our business here early, so...

07:43.796 --> 07:44.839
I thought I’d go and check out this yacht

07:44.839 --> 07:46.382
that I seen in Hawaii.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.217
Thought you come with me.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.178
Would you like to drink Mr. Lone?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.888
Yeah, I'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.181
Sure.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.390
Would you think I drink, Mr. Wilson?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.224
Oh no, that's okay.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.559
How much longer till take off?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.853
- Just a few more minutes.
- Okay, thank you.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.106
Sure you direct commercials?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.399
Yes, honey.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.610
How many times do you want me to tell you?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.778
Well, we just got back from
Miami doing Taco Bell, right?

08:07.778 --> 08:09.071
- Taco Bell?
- Yeah.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.073
- That was the one
- Philippines trip last month.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.159
That was for the Super
Bowl one with the horses.

08:13.159 --> 08:13.993
You like that one?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.411
- Oh yeah, with the horses?
- Yeah.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.705
I love horses.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.666
Hands up, hands up, hands up, don't move.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.584
Don't move.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.170
What is happening?

08:25.713 --> 08:27.131
Get those hands up.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.007
Put 'em up.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.638
You thought you could escape?

08:33.638 --> 08:34.931
- What?
- You're under arrest.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.723
Bring 'em boys.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.807
- Arrest?
- Go, get up.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.100
- Get up.
- Arrest?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.311
- Get up, get out.
- Let's go.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.854
This is a mistake.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.439
- Come on.
- Go.

08:43.439 --> 08:44.440
- Move pretty boy.
- I don't wanna go.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.733
- Go!
- Go, get out.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.030
I thought this
would be our final run ever.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.616
We'd go back to the States and retire.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.118
We'd made millions and
millions of dollars.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.453
But God had other plans.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.583
I remember before my mother
died, she told me a quote.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.503
"Without God, all of our
efforts turned to ashes

09:05.503 --> 09:08.339
and our sunrise into
the darkest of nights."

09:08.339 --> 09:11.133
I scoffed at her and said it was rubbish.

09:11.133 --> 09:11.968
How wrong was I?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.309
You guys are in a lot of trouble.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.769
I'm Captain Tanu.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.188
I'm the head of the local
Drug enforcement agency

09:24.188 --> 09:25.231
and I'm also the warden

09:25.231 --> 09:27.108
of the prison that you'll be going to.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.112
If you listen and obey all the rules,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.822
things will be easy for you.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.657
But do understand this,

09:34.657 --> 09:37.576
drug charges, it is the greatest crime

09:37.576 --> 09:39.704
you can commit in this country.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.331
So if you obey,

09:42.331 --> 09:44.125
everything will be okay.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.543
Make it easy for yourself.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.961
You understand that?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.879
These drugs that
you are talking about, they,

09:48.879 --> 09:50.006
they've been planted on us.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.424
We are innocent.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.466
They've been planted.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.342
Shut up.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.597
Stop talking, Peter.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.391
Do I look like an idiot to you?

10:00.391 --> 10:01.809
No, I just--

10:01.809 --> 10:05.187
Your boys squealed like
pigs when they got caught.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.898
They named both of you.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.236
Listen, I’m...

10:13.070 --> 10:15.031
I direct commercials for a living.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.198
You've got the wrong guys here.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.325
I don't know what...

10:17.325 --> 10:19.327
I dunno what's going on, but
this is, this ain't right.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.161
I'm telling you--

10:20.161 --> 10:22.705
Are you the ringleaders or are you not?

10:22.705 --> 10:23.539
What?

10:23.539 --> 10:24.373
Ringleader of what?

10:26.667 --> 10:28.127
We're innocent, man.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.421
Your innocent?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.303
You both will be given the death penalty.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.679
What?

10:38.679 --> 10:40.306
And I

10:40.306 --> 10:41.891
will be the ones that execute you.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.562
Good luck to you.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.775
Jesus, this can't be happening.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.609
This can't be happening.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.743
They got the wrong guys, it’s fine...

11:12.129 --> 11:13.214
Who is this person?

11:13.214 --> 11:14.382
I don't know him.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.469
You were with him.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.720
No.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.974
I mean, I thought he
was a different person.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.476
He told me

11:25.476 --> 11:28.062
he making Super Bowl commercials.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.649
I didn't know he is a drug dealer.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.403
He said you'll help him with bail.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.237
No way.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.116
I just wanna go back home, please?

11:46.872 --> 11:47.915
You are free to go.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.253
Thank you.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.340
You don't wanna say goodbye

11:56.340 --> 11:58.050
to your boyfriend before you leave?

11:58.050 --> 11:58.968
No way.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.637
We are through.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.224
Of course you're through.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.810
When the going gets tough,
gold diggers always are.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.480
I'm not a gold digger.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.191
Good luck to you.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.409
Do you have a water?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.827
Get him some water.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.661
So thirsty...

12:27.288 --> 12:28.956
Where's my girlfriend?

12:28.956 --> 12:29.790
She left.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.834
She left?

12:31.834 --> 12:32.918
What do you mean?

12:32.918 --> 12:36.630
I mean, you ever heard of
that Michael Jackson song?

12:37.465 --> 12:41.260
♪ She's out of my life ♪

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
She's outta your life.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.810
She is out of your life.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.104
It's over for you, sir.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.647
You will be killed here.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.152
I cannot wait to see the look on your face

12:58.152 --> 13:00.488
when they execute you by the firing squad.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.824
I promise you, you'll cry like a baby.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.037
You'll cry like a baby.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.080
Good luck to you.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.677
We spent three days in trial

13:23.677 --> 13:25.804
and we're now awaiting our verdict.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.807
Even had the US Consulate's office come.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.151
Hey fellas.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.321
Well, what are you, what are you thinking?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.156
What am I thinking?

13:44.156 --> 13:45.699
Well, I'm gonna do my best.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.452
That's all I can do.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.620
All rise.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.336
Your honor, Mr. Lone

13:57.336 --> 14:00.506
was caught with seven kilos of cocaine.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.590
He is guilty.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.468
He deserves the death penalty.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.387
Mr. Wilson was the ringleader.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.014
Mr. Lone was also a ringleader.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.517
Yes, your Honor.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.394
I'm Adam Markman with
the US Consulate Office.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.564
And I wish to state our
objections to this trial.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.691
Yeah, we believe the facts
were not fully presented

14:18.691 --> 14:20.609
and we enter our objections.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.111
Further, we do not believe their actions

14:22.111 --> 14:23.612
warrant a death penalty.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.073
And we consider the death
penalty by Firing Squad

14:26.073 --> 14:28.701
to be a cruel and unusual punishment.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.539
Anything you wish to say?

14:35.082 --> 14:36.625
Your Honor,

14:36.625 --> 14:39.336
we are completely
innocent of these crimes.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.713
We have been set up.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.549
I don't even know who these
men are that have accused us.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.552
We, we just want to go home.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.306
Your Honor, we're just tourists.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.393
We don't know anything about
what's going on out here.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.103
Enough.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.481
I sentence all of you to
death by Firing Squad.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.942
You have 30 days to appeal.

15:01.942 --> 15:02.985
Take these men outta here.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.577
- No way, this isn't right!
- No wait.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.453
No way.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.454
No!

15:13.454 --> 15:15.289
No.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.673
We arrived at the prison gates.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.841
I couldn't think.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.052
I was on death row in
a third world country.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.810
They took everything from me, man.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.270
My houses, my cars,

15:38.270 --> 15:39.396
my cash,

15:39.396 --> 15:40.564
my fiance,

15:40.564 --> 15:41.732
even my best friend.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.319
They put Morgan in another
prison just to isolate me.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.157
It was a nightmare I
couldn't wake myself up from.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.160
Come on, let's go.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.246
Let's go.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.502
My entire life was just a blur.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.128
It was all just meaningless now.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.552
It was a strange
international prison camp.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.722
The guards were these
mercenaries from other countries,

16:13.722 --> 16:17.184
and at the top was this guy, Captain Tanu.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.560
He absolutely hated me.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.913
You are in this rotting
jail for one reason

16:37.913 --> 16:39.373
and one reason alone.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.960
You are unworthy,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.169
disgusting,

16:44.169 --> 16:46.213
vile, vermin.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.591
This is an international prison.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.385
We have Americans,

16:51.385 --> 16:53.011
Australians,

16:53.011 --> 16:54.263
Asians,

16:54.263 --> 16:56.348
Nigerians, and Europeans.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.893
None of your countries want you back.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.148
You're discarded pieces of trash.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.361
Let that sink in.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.198
Sir?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.204
You do not speak unless you are spoken to.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.998
I, I was just asking.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.958
- Solitary confinement.
- Let's go.

17:22.958 --> 17:23.792
Wait.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.421
Three days, no food.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.590
Anyone who tries to escape.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.549
I couldn't believe my eyes.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.800
Will be put into
solitary confinement.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.676
Liu Fat was here.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.344
That's why I couldn't contact him.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.763
I just wonder how he got caught.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.931
Some of you await execution.

17:37.931 --> 17:41.101
In our country, you will be executed.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.603
This isn't America.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.064
We don't wait 30 years for you to die.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.232
Here, we get the job done.

17:51.695 --> 17:52.529
Good luck to you.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.499
Get in there.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.086
Welcome to Hotel Hanoi, vermin.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.378
Do not try to escape.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.254
Or we'll shoot you dead.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.965
Understood?

18:11.965 --> 18:12.800
Yes.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.053
The first three nights are terrifying.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.679
You'll get used to it, Hollywood.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.645
It was like your worst nightmare.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.063
I only wanted to die.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.439
I had no hope to live anymore.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.440
Nothing mattered to me.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.359
I was a walking dead man.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.154
No.

18:34.154 --> 18:34.988
No, no!

18:38.575 --> 18:39.576
Why?!

18:39.576 --> 18:40.577
Why?

18:40.577 --> 18:41.411
Why?!

19:02.307 --> 19:03.142
Liu,

19:04.768 --> 19:05.853
when did you get here?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.271
Six months ago.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.064
I told you they were onto us.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.359
What was your sentence?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.611
Death by firing squad.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.530
Hey, hey, hey, break it up, break it up.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.823
Why are you guys here?

19:17.823 --> 19:18.907
Ladies chatting over here.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.284
Break it up, break it up.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.206
I bet you this is the
hardest work you've ever done

19:26.206 --> 19:27.583
in your whole life

19:27.583 --> 19:28.917
in one day, huh?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.295
At least I've earned more money

19:31.295 --> 19:32.629
in a week than you ever will.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.465
What did you say?

19:35.465 --> 19:37.134
What did you mean by that?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.136
What do I mean?

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
I meant that my life,

19:41.972 --> 19:43.140
I've achieved more

19:43.140 --> 19:45.350
than you ever will in
this stinkin' prison.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.852
Hey, can you shut up?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.521
Guard?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.942
Make Mr. Big Shot here and
his sidekick pick up bricks

19:53.942 --> 19:56.403
for an extra three hours.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.654
You heard the Captain.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.114
Pick up the bricks.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.535
You heard the captain,

20:03.535 --> 20:05.537
pick up the bricks.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.914
God, help me.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.290
God help me.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.333
God help me.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.251
Why do all the prisoners
say, "God help me".

20:11.251 --> 20:12.753
There is no God.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.339
News flash, in this prison, I am your God.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.298
Get to work.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.716
Pick up the bricks now!

20:20.552 --> 20:21.762
Why am I being punished?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.263
I didn't say anything.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.097
You heard the captain.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.891
Pick up the bricks.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.935
Pick 'em up, now

20:27.935 --> 20:30.687
Are you trying to ruin my life, man?

20:30.687 --> 20:33.815
Me?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.651
You, you're the one that hired the fool

20:35.651 --> 20:38.403
that snitched us in the first place.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.241
Liu, watch your back, man.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.242
I'm gonna kill you, Liu.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.827
I'm gonna kill you, Liu.
Knock it off.

So this is one of
Elena's signature pieces.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.187
It's six feet by six feet.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.481
The price is $15,000.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.859
Elena's very well known around the world

21:58.859 --> 22:00.944
because of her vibrant colors.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.738
If you're interested in a sculpture,

22:02.738 --> 22:05.490
we have these beautiful NASA spacesuits.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.117
They are made of fiberglass,

22:07.117 --> 22:09.036
roughly six feet tall,

22:09.036 --> 22:13.081
and the price for each one is $34,900.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.417
Morgan, what do you say?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.835
You want one?

22:16.835 --> 22:18.253
- No.
- Yeah, I want one.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.838
I want a souvenir too.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.965
Alright, we'll take two of these as well.

22:21.965 --> 22:22.966
Okay.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.385
American Express Black card.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.887
You don't see too many
of these around.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.388
Yeah, they say just 1%.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.026
Such a beautiful day today.

22:42.069 --> 22:42.986
Yeah, it's nice.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.157
Ah.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.743
Peter, I just love being with you.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.747
Hey, what if have a baby together?

22:55.707 --> 22:56.541
A baby?

22:56.541 --> 22:57.876
Yeah, a baby.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.465
How am I supposed to fit a
child seat in that Ferrari?

23:03.465 --> 23:04.758
Just get a normal car.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.634
It's two seats.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.804
Normal car.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.473
You say some stupid
things sometimes, Karen.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.974
Come on, let's get a cocktail.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.736
This guy's never on time, man.

23:24.736 --> 23:25.946
Yeah, he's late again.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.739
Hey.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.242
Fat Liu...

23:34.037 --> 23:35.872
Is that gonna get through?

23:35.872 --> 23:37.582
Yeah, these bags are lead lined.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.792
Dogs can't sniff it out.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.961
I like you guys.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.546
You guys are geniuses.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.964
So this is gonna travel
from Taiwan to Indonesia

23:43.964 --> 23:46.424
and then on to Shanghai, right?

23:46.424 --> 23:47.259
Yeah.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.718
You guys know it's the death penalty

23:48.718 --> 23:49.970
if you get caught, right?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.556
We're too smart to get caught.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.976
Alright, it's a million.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.810
Count it.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.691
Should we count it?

24:03.608 --> 24:05.986
No finders for
you this time, right?

24:05.986 --> 24:07.654
- No.
- Good.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.906
I don't have time to count a
hundred dollar bills anyway.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.381
All right.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.632
Pleasure...

24:27.632 --> 24:29.676
doing... business...

24:29.676 --> 24:31.553
Safe travels, Liu.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.975
"Do I have a death wish," Morgan asked.

24:36.975 --> 24:37.809
Maybe I did.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.731
What's up brother?

24:42.731 --> 24:43.523
What's going on, man?

24:43.523 --> 24:45.400
What’d you wanna talk about?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.193
You finish up?

24:47.235 --> 24:48.111
Y'all good?

24:48.111 --> 24:50.030
Yeah, I mean, yeah, everything's fine.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.323
I wanna see you are okay.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.534
Do you ever wake up,

24:56.369 --> 24:58.246
And realize your life has no purpose?

25:01.416 --> 25:02.751
Are you high?

25:02.751 --> 25:04.294
Oh, I'm serious, man.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.420
No, I mean, listen, if you are,

25:05.420 --> 25:07.547
I've got some of the
finest products in the car

25:07.547 --> 25:08.381
if you wanna try it.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.508
I don't want any drugs.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.926
- I just--
- What is it?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.594
I feel like I'm trapped in this

25:13.595 --> 25:16.848
illusion of money, gambling and sports and I’m...

25:19.851 --> 25:20.894
I just can't quite...

25:23.688 --> 25:24.522
get out of it.

25:26.942 --> 25:27.817
Brother, it’s...

25:28.693 --> 25:29.861
this is our life, man.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.654
Like

25:32.280 --> 25:33.531
you're thinking too deep.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.870
I just wanna know that
there's more than this,

25:40.455 --> 25:42.332
that there's meaning out there somewhere.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.462
You're not gonna find that
answer in this lifetime, buddy.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.421
I promise you that.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.885
Hi, I'm Pastor John Lynbrook.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.472
Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.057
I'm, I'm not selling anything.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.560
You're selling Jesus, no?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.145
Jesus is for free.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.522
So is the gospel.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.357
And salvation is a gift.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.400
Salvation.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.234
Hmm.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.986
You know, my brother believes in Jesus

26:10.986 --> 26:12.070
and he died of cancer.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.157
Do you believe in Jesus?

26:16.157 --> 26:17.242
I believe in myself.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.036
I've had a rough upbringing.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.162
My father died when I was 10,

26:21.162 --> 26:22.831
leaving just my mom to raise cash fast

26:22.831 --> 26:24.374
and look after us... on her own.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.960
So it was up to me

26:26.960 --> 26:28.503
to put food on the table.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.630
I don't remember Jesus
being around for that.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.593
I know you've been given a death penalty.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.678
So?

26:37.762 --> 26:38.972
We're all gonna die at some point.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.557
You're right.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.268
We all are, but eternity is forever.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.062
Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.064
You can be in Heaven

26:48.064 --> 26:49.524
or you can be in Hell.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.109
The choice is yours.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.153
Excuse me buddy.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.946
I wasn't ready to hear about this Jesus.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.241
All I wanted to do was escape this prison.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.076
And then I met Samuel.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.119
I thought I found a way out.

27:01.119 --> 27:01.995
Hey my brother.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.916
You that high profile dude
coming in from the US?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.669
What you in for?

27:09.669 --> 27:10.503
Drugs.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.631
Yeah, me too.

27:13.965 --> 27:14.799
Yeah?

27:15.717 --> 27:17.469
What was your sentence?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.429
Firing squad.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.181
This place is, it's insane.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.643
Every one of us got death.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.519
Have you ever thought about escaping?

27:29.522 --> 27:31.983
Every single second of every single day.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.944
Yeah, and I got a plan too.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.490
We knew it was one in a million chance.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.116
Samuel agreed to help my friend Morgan

27:40.116 --> 27:42.661
in the Denpasar prison
by the same method.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.621
We'd pose as the media.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.915
I'd meet Morgan at the
Jakarta subway station.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.544
Hey, Tanu.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.921
It's Captain Tanu.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.341
Why are we not allowed to
call our families back home?

27:56.341 --> 27:58.301
Because you're prisoners.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.136
You're not some guests on a cruise ship.

28:00.136 --> 28:02.097
You don't deserve any special favors.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.515
Yeah, I know we're prisoners,

28:03.515 --> 28:05.016
But we're not animals.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.601
We have basic human rights.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.728
You have no rights, sir.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.771
Let me spell it out for you.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.689
They don't care about you.

28:10.689 --> 28:15.485
They disavow you, prisoner 5724.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.531
Remember, you're a drug
dealer, non redeemable.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.532
Good luck to you.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.076
I'm a drug runner,

28:23.076 --> 28:24.244
not a drug dealer.

28:24.244 --> 28:25.662
Guards, get him out of here

28:25.662 --> 28:26.621
before I put him in the box.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.082
Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm
leaving, I'm leaving.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.625
What is the difference
between a drug dealer

28:30.625 --> 28:32.043
and a drug runner?

28:32.877 --> 28:35.755
Sir, a drug dealer deals in drugs

28:35.755 --> 28:39.467
and a drug runner... jogs?

28:47.600 --> 28:48.768
Hey Liu.

28:48.768 --> 28:49.644
What?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.187
It was Morgan's father

28:51.187 --> 28:52.355
that snitched on us.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.650
Morgan's father?

28:56.734 --> 28:57.819
Really?

28:57.819 --> 28:58.653
Yeah.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.573
It was neither of us.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.491
It was... his dad.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.788
So I just came here to,

29:09.998 --> 29:13.710
well, I guess I need
to give you an apology.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.843
I'll catch you later, man.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.475
Don't even think about it.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.727
What?

29:30.727 --> 29:32.228
Committing suicide.

29:32.228 --> 29:35.398
Suicide is too good for
drug dealers like you,

29:35.398 --> 29:37.150
too merciful, too kind.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.820
There you go again with the "drug dealer".

29:40.820 --> 29:43.072
You know what, drug runner, drug dealer,

29:43.072 --> 29:44.240
drug lord,

29:44.240 --> 29:46.868
whatever label you wanna
put on me in this prison

29:46.868 --> 29:48.912
doesn't make you any
better, you know that.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.914
You’re nothing but a little bully.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.123
That's how everyone looks at you.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.625
Bully these prisoners.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.376
Is that what gets you off?

29:55.376 --> 29:56.211
What you on?

29:56.211 --> 29:59.214
$20, $30 an hour with overtime?

29:59.214 --> 30:00.757
You're pathetic.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.841
Do you even know what it's like to dine

30:01.841 --> 30:02.884
at a Michelin star restaurant

30:02.884 --> 30:04.636
with beautiful women on your arm

30:04.636 --> 30:07.096
who wouldn't even look
twice at a man like you?

30:08.389 --> 30:09.891
You are a loser.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.769
That's what you are, a loser.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.272
I'm not scared of you anymore, man.

30:16.272 --> 30:17.106
No more.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.568
You're so cocky.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.699
I'll put the bullets in
your head with my own gun.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.493
Yeah, do it.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.119
Do it.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.120
Do it!

30:31.120 --> 30:31.955
Huh?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.081
Do it!

30:33.081 --> 30:34.332
Get in there.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.550
How I survived the
first few months was beyond me.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.385
There was nothing that could save me.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.763
Nothing except... the cross.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.642
With my hope diminishing,
I plan to escape.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.394
It was the only thing giving me solace.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.478
What?

30:55.478 --> 30:57.939
I've been talking to Samuel.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.399
I think he can break us out of here, man.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.817
He can help us escape.

31:00.817 --> 31:01.859
Are you crazy?

31:03.278 --> 31:06.239
Just trust me on this, okay?

31:06.239 --> 31:07.073
Fine.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.591
Yo, whoa, whoa, will you ease up.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.384
No with the handshakes.

31:26.384 --> 31:30.138
Y'all acting like we planning something.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.055
What is the plan?

31:33.683 --> 31:35.768
We gonna walk straight outta here.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.270
Pretend to be the media.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.731
Okay, but how?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.482
They know us.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.027
There's a new guard coming in on Tuesday.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.486
He don't know us yet.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.654
Understand me?

31:46.654 --> 31:48.823
What about, credentials, press ID badges,

31:48.823 --> 31:49.949
suits?

31:49.949 --> 31:51.492
You just leave that to me.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.830
Wait, so what are you getting
out of helping us, man?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.293
I want $1 million.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.338
Peter has it.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.756
I know he has it.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.424
- Most drug dealers do.
- Yeah.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.137
We're not drug dealers.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.513
My apologies.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.556
Drug kingpin.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.772
Okay.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.689
We've go a deal.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.067
A million dollars.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.652
Cash.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.486
But.

32:27.737 --> 32:30.782
I'm trusting you on your
word, you understand me?

32:30.782 --> 32:31.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.825
You got it.

32:32.825 --> 32:34.160
Shake on it?

32:34.160 --> 32:35.620
We we don't do handshakes.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.497
What are you talking about?

32:37.497 --> 32:38.581
- So once we're out--
- Yeah?

32:38.581 --> 32:39.582
How do we leave the country?

32:39.582 --> 32:40.708
They took our passports, remember?

32:40.708 --> 32:42.293
Well, that's on you.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.461
You gotta get to Australia.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.338
I'm going via Thailand.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.257
- Australia!
- Shut your mouth.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.300
Australia?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.343
That's miles away.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.970
That's correct.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.180
You gotta take the subway to a boat.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.807
I'm going via train.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.101
No, way can we have two white dudes

32:58.101 --> 32:59.268
and a black guy walking around.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.770
That's just inconspicuous.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.189
I'm not even white.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.023
Close enough.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.150
What?

33:07.944 --> 33:08.778
All right.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.490
Timing is everything.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.741
Hear me?

33:13.741 --> 33:15.118
Keep my name out your mouth.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.928
Remember,

33:33.928 --> 33:35.179
do as we rehearsed.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.305
Okay.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.765
Drop you off at the subway.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.226
I'm going to Thailand.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.271
All right, all right, fine.

33:44.856 --> 33:45.690
Alright, so

33:46.983 --> 33:48.901
We’re interviewing the president next, right?

33:48.901 --> 33:50.528
Then we'll probably
talk to the first lady.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.404
This is part of the...

33:51.404 --> 33:53.072
prison freedom.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.240
I just wanna watch football.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.616
Do I have to?

33:55.616 --> 33:57.452
If you wanna remain a CBS, you do, man.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.286
Excuse me.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.120
Badges, please.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.997
Oh, no, no, we didn't get any badges.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.039
Oh, no, wait.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.583
You're right.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.419
Wait, did you leave 'em on the table?

34:06.419 --> 34:07.253
No.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.129
Oh, Scott.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.213
- Scott.
- That’s right!

34:09.213 --> 34:10.339
- Scott's got them.
- Yeah.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.174
You want us to call him?

34:11.174 --> 34:12.633
We can call him.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.386
No, I don't believe you
guys are on the list.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.554
Of course we're on the list.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.430
Really, like we're just a bit late.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.681
Yeah, it's been a busy morning.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.059
I'll have to check with that.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.018
What you need our names?

34:22.018 --> 34:22.852
Give, give 'em our names.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.312
Your names, yeah.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.396
I'm, I'm Mark, Mark Austin.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.273
- Okay.
- Steven Firth.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.107
Mark Fa.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.485
Okay.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.320
You may pass.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.488
- Thank you for your help.
- Yeah.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.530
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.365
Tight security in this place here.

34:36.365 --> 34:37.200
Tight.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.953
I thought it was a racist
thing at first, you know?

34:40.953 --> 34:42.705
- Yeah.
- Being black and everything.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.875
You know what he needs us to do.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.960
I think we're out.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.297
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, I think we're out.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.176
Go, go.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.019
Sir, I'm sorry, sir.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.230
Sir?

35:08.189 --> 35:09.023
I'm sorry.

35:11.108 --> 35:12.318
Sir, I apologize.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.236
You,

35:13.236 --> 35:15.071
you are a disgrace to our company.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.030
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- How could you

35:16.030 --> 35:16.906
- let them get away?
- I'm sorry, sir.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.282
- Under my watch.
- I'm sorry.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.659
Gimme that weapon.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.205
Find them.

35:28.417 --> 35:31.629
Morgan broke out of Denpasar
Prison the exact same way

35:31.629 --> 35:33.840
by pretending to be the media.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.174
Samuel had arranged it all.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.301
We were guided to the subway

35:37.301 --> 35:40.847
at Setiyabudi station
by a Nigerian named Uche.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.640
But he left us once we got on board.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.414
We did it.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.583
No, we still gotta make it to the pier.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.126
Yeah, we just gotta meet
the guy with the boat.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.419
He's gonna take us to the Philippines.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.253
What guy?

36:12.253 --> 36:13.421
I don't know.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.964
Just the guy that set us to meet.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.383
Oh, we did it brother.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.306
We did it.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.989
I want to see those hands... move, move, move, move.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.619
Hands, hands, hands.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.375
It was I that thought

36:51.375 --> 36:53.836
of the stupid idea of escaping.

36:53.836 --> 36:54.921
How wrong I was.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.838
Move.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.758
It was too good to be true.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.219
Liu was caught at the pier in Jakarta

37:02.219 --> 37:04.013
trying to escape to Australia.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.473
To begin with breaking news.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.808
Indonesian police have arrested an American

37:07.808 --> 37:10.645
who escaped from a prison in Jakarta.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.439
And Samuel was caught
at the border into Thailand.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.573
Let's go get him.

37:22.573 --> 37:23.449
Let's go.

37:23.449 --> 37:24.408
Come on.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.242
Guards.

37:30.331 --> 37:30.873
Down.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.003
Hello Peter.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.713
Where do you think you were going?

37:39.423 --> 37:41.342
I was looking for a good sushi spot.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.176
You know any?

37:43.719 --> 37:44.887
Funny guy.

37:47.014 --> 37:50.768
Your humor will dry out quickly
in solitary confinement.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.104
Yeah, we caught your
buddies, Liu and Samuel too.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.605
None of you escaped.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.441
I like to bite the head off
of a snake, as they say.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.194
And you, Peter,

38:00.194 --> 38:02.071
you're the snake.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.280
This will break you.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.491
- Take him away.
- Let's go.

38:06.867 --> 38:07.702
Come on.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.625
Everybody step out.

38:20.339 --> 38:24.468
This pathetic maggot got caught
trying to escape my prison.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.137
Nobody escapes my prison.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.723
Two of his buddies were caught as well.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.850
This one, solitary confinement.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.269
Four days without food or water.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.645
Any of you try to do the same thing,

38:34.645 --> 38:36.063
you'll get the treatment.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.273
Is that understood?

38:37.273 --> 38:38.482
Yes, sir.

38:38.482 --> 38:39.483
Let's go.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.579
Get in there.

38:55.082 --> 38:58.002
Let's see how you do
in there, Mr. Big Shot.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.421
Four days, no food, no water.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.797
Most do not make it.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.883
This will break you.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.301
Good luck to you.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.312
How about you and I

39:16.312 --> 39:18.105
get houses next to each other in Malibu.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.316
Malibu?

39:21.650 --> 39:22.568
I don't know, man.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.820
What is up with you, mate?

39:26.655 --> 39:28.699
I think this might be my last go, Pete.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.533
Last go?

39:29.533 --> 39:30.367
We're just getting started.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.202
Come on, man.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.538
Yeah, I know, I just,

39:35.664 --> 39:37.249
I grew up in a Christian home, man.

39:37.249 --> 39:39.752
I can't, can't keep doing this.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.670
Has that gotta do with the
price of a jet ski in Jamaica?

39:41.670 --> 39:42.922
Nothing, man, but like,

39:44.548 --> 39:45.674
well, you don't believe in God?

39:45.674 --> 39:46.509
Oh...

39:46.509 --> 39:48.761
Please don't, don't tell me
you've been saved by Jesus.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.514
What we're doing doesn't
have any repercussions?

39:51.514 --> 39:52.348
Just not the God.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.349
Just not the God thing.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.813
God doesn't exist, Morgan.

39:58.813 --> 39:59.855
It's an urban legend.

39:59.855 --> 40:00.689
A myth.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.740
Food.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.077
Just kidding.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.958
And so there I was
in solitary confinement.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.502
I was sure I was going to break.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.920
I felt like just crying and screaming,

40:22.920 --> 40:24.171
but no one could hear me.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.029
I started reading the Bible

40:49.029 --> 40:51.073
and it was just so powerful and stunning.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.617
I read John 3:16,

40:53.617 --> 40:54.952
"For God so loved the world

40:54.952 --> 40:56.620
that he gave his only begotten son,

40:56.620 --> 40:58.998
that whoever believes
in him shall not perish,

40:58.998 --> 41:00.458
but have everlasting life."

41:01.375 --> 41:04.086
How this verse escaped me my whole life,

41:04.086 --> 41:05.171
it all now made sense.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.049
Salvation finally came to me,

41:09.049 --> 41:11.802
and I was overjoyed with the
gratitude of God Almighty.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.356
How are you enjoying confinement?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.442
It's a living Hell,

41:29.278 --> 41:30.654
but I feel saved.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.574
You're beyond redemption.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.037
Do you have any food?

41:38.037 --> 41:39.955
Yeah, we have a five course
meal laid out for you,

41:39.955 --> 41:41.290
Mr. Big Shot.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.083
You're not so big anymore, right?

41:43.083 --> 41:44.001
Get back in there.

41:49.798 --> 41:51.592
I heard singing at the chapel.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.553
I wanted to go there and
learn more about Jesus.

41:54.553 --> 41:57.514
As soon as I came out of
confinement, I went to the chapel.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.059
Give praise to the Lord.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.101
Proclaim his name,

42:01.101 --> 42:04.396
make known among the
nations what he has done.

42:07.983 --> 42:11.237
As you know, I'm scheduled
to be executed next month,

42:11.237 --> 42:12.947
but I'm at peace

42:12.947 --> 42:14.949
because I wanna be with Jesus.

42:14.949 --> 42:15.991
Heaven is real.

42:15.991 --> 42:16.825
So is Hell.

42:16.825 --> 42:17.952
In fact, Jesus spoke

42:17.952 --> 42:20.329
more about Hell than He did Heaven.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.497
But the good news is

42:22.998 --> 42:24.333
you don't have to go there.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.671
Who among us in this room

42:30.547 --> 42:32.550
would like to be saved by Jesus Christ?

42:33.968 --> 42:35.010
Please come forward.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.721
Accept His blessings.

Hey, how was solitary?

43:51.837 --> 43:53.714
I'm not gonna lie to you, Liu.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.673
It was real bad,

43:56.258 --> 43:57.343
but at the same time,

43:58.719 --> 43:59.553
enlightening.

44:00.929 --> 44:01.889
What do you mean?

44:04.516 --> 44:05.976
I found salvation, brother.

44:08.187 --> 44:09.646
You've got to be kidding me.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.150
No, I'm, I'm not joking.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.526
I,

44:14.526 --> 44:15.361
I found God

44:16.320 --> 44:20.032
and I need to apologize to you.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.451
I'm the reason you’re here.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.288
I brought you into this mess, and

44:26.288 --> 44:27.998
all I can ask is for forgiveness.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.043
Forgive? You?

44:32.211 --> 44:33.337
No.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.714
I'm gonna be executed in three months.

44:35.714 --> 44:36.882
Keep it down.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.225
Two months went by

44:46.225 --> 44:48.227
and I was in for another
shock with Samuel.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.895
In Jesus' name.

44:49.895 --> 44:50.729
Amen.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.359
Hey, my brother.

44:56.193 --> 44:57.152
Hey, Samuel.

44:57.152 --> 44:59.988
I heard you found Christ in solitary.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.032
- That I did.
- That's amazing, brother.

45:03.158 --> 45:04.576
Well, guess what?

45:06.120 --> 45:07.413
I found Christ too.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.082
- Wow.
- That,

45:10.082 --> 45:10.916
that's amazing, brother.

45:10.916 --> 45:12.960
- Yeah.
- It's great news.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.755
And, and I'm reading the Bible
now, which is like...

45:17.381 --> 45:18.382
Cause...

45:19.842 --> 45:21.552
my father was a pastor,

45:23.429 --> 45:24.680
and um...

45:30.519 --> 45:32.646
I just found out he
died of a heart attack.

45:36.733 --> 45:38.444
You know, I,

45:38.444 --> 45:41.363
he was a pastor and I never,
I never even listened to him.

45:42.656 --> 45:45.367
Now, the worst day of
my life is my best day.

45:48.662 --> 45:50.372
You know it took a death sentence

45:50.372 --> 45:51.957
to get me straight with God.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.795
Hey, when we get executed,
let's go out singing.

45:59.089 --> 46:00.132
I still have the ah

46:00.132 --> 46:01.800
the appeal with the Supreme Court.

46:04.762 --> 46:08.432
I, I hope that day doesn't come.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.391
You go with that.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.229
But the truth was

46:14.229 --> 46:16.440
not why did God send man to Hell,

46:16.440 --> 46:18.984
but why God allowed man into Heaven.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.360
I didn't realize it then,

46:20.360 --> 46:22.613
but all of this was because
of God's love for me

46:22.613 --> 46:23.447
and this world.

46:29.077 --> 46:31.663
And then I saw her, her name was Miriam.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.499
She was so beautiful and angelic.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.468
Excuse me.

46:44.468 --> 46:47.554
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you there.

46:47.554 --> 46:48.931
I,

46:48.931 --> 46:51.183
well, I, I keep seeing
you around this prison

46:51.183 --> 46:54.978
and well, I just wanted to
come and introduce myself.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.438
I'm Peter.

46:56.438 --> 46:57.731
Hello.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.191
I've heard about you and the other,

46:59.191 --> 47:00.609
you're the American, right?

47:00.609 --> 47:01.735
Not quite.

47:01.735 --> 47:03.070
I'm actually the Brit,

47:03.070 --> 47:05.614
although I was caught
with some Americans, yeah.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.699
What is it you, what is it you do here?

47:07.699 --> 47:09.993
Oh, I pray with my church group

47:09.993 --> 47:11.620
For all the prisoners here.

47:11.620 --> 47:12.454
- Oh, wow.
- We've been doing it

47:12.454 --> 47:13.497
for about seven years.

47:13.497 --> 47:14.915
That's amazing.

47:14.915 --> 47:17.000
Oh, what are
you in here for again?

47:18.544 --> 47:20.337
I was caught with a lot of drugs.

47:21.838 --> 47:22.673
Yeah, yeah.

47:22.673 --> 47:23.924
You were a drug dealer.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.677
Yes.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.470
I, I was a drug dealer.

47:28.470 --> 47:29.763
Yeah, but

47:29.763 --> 47:32.766
I'm a new creation now, through Christ.

47:32.766 --> 47:34.476
- You're joking?
- No.

47:34.476 --> 47:35.310
Praise God.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.520
How did you come to find Him?

47:36.520 --> 47:38.939
Well, Pastor Lynbrook,

47:38.939 --> 47:39.898
the chapel,

47:40.732 --> 47:42.734
a few days in solitary confinement.

47:42.734 --> 47:44.319
That's enough to turn anyone to God.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.362
Let me tell you that.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.617
You are on death row, I hear?

47:51.577 --> 47:52.744
Yes.

47:52.744 --> 47:53.745
Yes, I am, but

47:55.080 --> 47:56.290
I'm not dead yet, right?

48:00.377 --> 48:03.088
Listen, if you don't mind,

48:03.088 --> 48:05.841
would you care to get lunch
with me one of these days?

48:09.928 --> 48:11.763
No, I'm sorry.

48:11.763 --> 48:14.266
I'm not allowed to
fraternize with prisoners.

48:14.266 --> 48:16.435
- I'm so sorry, I--
- No,

48:16.435 --> 48:17.686
I get it, it's,

48:17.686 --> 48:18.896
I understand completely.

48:19.896 --> 48:20.731
Either way, it was,

48:20.731 --> 48:22.274
it was lovely meeting to you, Miriam.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.444
I'll, I'll let you go, sorry.

48:25.444 --> 48:26.778
Hope to see you again sometime, right?

48:26.778 --> 48:27.821
Yeah, yeah.

48:27.821 --> 48:28.822
God bless.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.709
As it states in 2 Corinthians,

48:40.709 --> 48:42.419
there was “a new creation in Christ”

48:43.837 --> 48:46.256
and absolutely no
condemnation through the Lord.

48:50.719 --> 48:51.720
I'm ready to die.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.981
Thank you Peter.

49:04.107 --> 49:06.026
You know, Amazing Grace saved us all.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.780
Tomorrow's not guaranteed to anyone.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.366
Right now, today is the day of salvation.

49:13.867 --> 49:16.787

Ms. Miriam.

49:54.533 --> 49:55.951
What were they doing in there?

49:55.951 --> 49:57.411
The church service, sir.

49:58.370 --> 50:00.414
Oh, I understand that, but

50:00.414 --> 50:02.290
why did those two guys step forward?

50:03.333 --> 50:05.293
To accept Jesus.

50:05.293 --> 50:06.253
What did you think?

50:07.754 --> 50:10.674
Religion, the bane of our existence.

50:12.217 --> 50:14.845
Hatred is the bane of our existence, sir.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.054
Hmm.

50:16.054 --> 50:18.515
You know, half of the
men are gonna be executed

50:18.515 --> 50:20.308
in this camp, and the other half,

50:20.308 --> 50:22.936
they're just gonna die
in this rotting jail.

50:22.936 --> 50:25.647
If there is a God, he
doesn't care or love them.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.651
Redemption is available to all.

50:29.651 --> 50:31.194
That's the beauty of the cross.

50:32.028 --> 50:34.156
The love of Jesus covers all.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.159
- The love of Jesus.
- Uh huh.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.786
I don't believe in love.

50:43.081 --> 50:44.666
Have you ever been married, sir?

50:47.794 --> 50:48.628
I was.

50:51.548 --> 50:54.092
My wife died of cancer two
years after our wedding.

50:55.761 --> 50:56.678
I'm so sorry.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.185
That's why

51:03.185 --> 51:04.061
there is no God.

51:05.312 --> 51:08.940
That's why believing in God is stupid.

51:08.940 --> 51:11.359
Love is stupid.

51:11.359 --> 51:13.779
This world that's all about survival.

51:13.779 --> 51:16.531
We see this in this camp every single day.

51:16.531 --> 51:19.284
And right here, right now,

51:19.284 --> 51:20.911
it's the only truth that matters.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.041
I was,

51:27.459 --> 51:28.543
I was reading this sir

51:31.963 --> 51:34.633
John 14:27.

51:36.551 --> 51:38.553
"Peace I leave with you.

51:38.553 --> 51:40.806
My peace I give to you
not as the world gives

51:40.806 --> 51:41.890
to I give to you.

51:43.391 --> 51:46.103
Let not your heart be troubled,
neither let it be afraid."

51:50.607 --> 51:52.150
I think you need peace, sir.

51:56.321 --> 51:57.531
Thanks Ms. Miriam.

51:59.825 --> 52:01.159
Have a good day.

52:09.709 --> 52:11.461
In the ensuing final days,

52:11.461 --> 52:13.380
I began to fall in love with Miriam.

52:24.391 --> 52:26.977
There was one inmate who would
not hear about Jesus though.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.770
And I was praying for his salvation.

52:30.897 --> 52:33.400
Liu, how's it going, man?

52:33.400 --> 52:34.651
Peter.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.735
They just told me

52:35.735 --> 52:37.779
that they're gonna make
their final decision tonight

52:37.779 --> 52:39.990
on me and Lynbrook.

52:39.990 --> 52:42.784
They're gonna execute us tomorrow night.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.245
And our lawyer tried to
file an emergency appeal,

52:45.245 --> 52:47.873
but they said our chances aren't good.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.541
Let's, let's pray for this right now.

52:49.541 --> 52:50.709
I'm scared, man.

52:50.709 --> 52:51.835
I don't want to die.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.424
Look, you must be terrified.

52:57.424 --> 52:58.800
All right.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.928
Nothing in this world makes
sense right now, brother.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.431
In the world's eyes, we deserve death.

53:06.349 --> 53:07.184
Maybe we do.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.353
But this is your time to turn to God.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.773
There's no second chances.

53:13.773 --> 53:15.400
No second chances.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.611
That's the story of my life.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.029
If there is a God,

53:19.029 --> 53:21.197
why is he allowing this to happen to me?

53:24.326 --> 53:25.160
I dunno.

53:26.161 --> 53:27.329
I don't dunno, man, it...

53:28.830 --> 53:30.999
Look, this is the reason...

53:33.251 --> 53:36.213
This whole experience
brought me closer to God.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.380
It brought me closer to salvation.

53:37.380 --> 53:40.217
And you knew the type of guy I was before.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.802
Maybe the same can happen to you.

53:42.802 --> 53:44.930
You know, forget this death penalty.

53:44.930 --> 53:47.307
In life, we all have a death penalty.

53:47.307 --> 53:50.101
It's just when it's our time
to go, it's our time to go.

53:52.812 --> 53:54.648
And eternity is forever, brother.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.316
No one gets a free pass.

53:56.316 --> 53:59.194
But when we die, that's when we meet God.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.530
I'm sorry man.

54:02.530 --> 54:04.199
I can't accept that.

54:05.575 --> 54:07.118
I couldn't understand why a man

54:07.118 --> 54:08.078
who was facing death

54:08.078 --> 54:10.664
could not just stop for a
brief moment and seek God.

54:11.498 --> 54:12.415
Maybe he still would,

54:12.415 --> 54:14.626
even to the final hour
before his execution.

54:19.839 --> 54:20.799
Pastor Lynbrook,

54:22.801 --> 54:23.927
how are you my friend?

54:24.803 --> 54:25.637
You okay?

54:25.637 --> 54:26.763
I'm okay, Peter.

54:26.763 --> 54:27.597
Look, I'm,

54:28.807 --> 54:29.891
I'm at peace.

54:29.891 --> 54:32.102
And God is doing amazing work around here.

54:34.145 --> 54:34.980
Look, I,

54:37.148 --> 54:39.192
I came to Christ because of you.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.696
I just, I wanted to let you know that.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.781
It was the Holy Spirit.

54:44.781 --> 54:46.741
I was glad He could use me to help you.

54:49.452 --> 54:51.454
I want you to take over the church.

54:51.454 --> 54:52.998
You're the only one I trust in here.

54:52.998 --> 54:54.124
No, I don't,

54:54.124 --> 54:56.710
I don't know, you
know what I've done and

54:56.710 --> 54:58.044
the things I've, I've seen.

54:58.044 --> 54:59.129
You can do it.

54:59.129 --> 54:59.963
I know.

55:04.509 --> 55:06.761
Look, I've, I've never asked you, but

55:08.805 --> 55:10.056
why are you in here?

55:14.019 --> 55:15.061
I committed murder.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.398
I was surfing in Bali and I saw my

55:19.357 --> 55:21.109
girlfriend talking to some

55:21.109 --> 55:23.111
man on the beach, and she

55:23.111 --> 55:25.739
later admitted she's
having an affair with him.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.449
I went ballistic and I killed him.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.827
Like I deserved to go to Hell.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.539
But I found Christ in here

55:34.539 --> 55:36.041
and he forgave me.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.709
That's why I'm not afraid to die.

55:39.961 --> 55:40.795
Wow.

55:41.755 --> 55:42.922
Thank you for sharing that.

55:42.922 --> 55:43.757
I never knew

55:44.758 --> 55:45.633
You'll have to excuse me.

55:45.633 --> 55:48.178
But there's others here who
want me to pray for them, so.

55:50.555 --> 55:51.848
Tonight is my last service.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.808
I'm hope, I hope you're able to attend.

55:54.642 --> 55:55.477
Yes.

55:55.477 --> 55:56.728
It's the least we could do.

55:56.728 --> 55:57.562
We'll be there.

56:02.984 --> 56:05.070
They called it the execution wall.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.947
They never had a single
bullet actually hit the wall.

56:07.947 --> 56:10.116
My friend would be shot tomorrow.

56:10.116 --> 56:11.618
It was just so hard to fathom.

56:20.293 --> 56:22.045
How's everything with the pastor?

56:24.089 --> 56:25.173
He's,

56:25.173 --> 56:27.342
he's taking it well.

56:27.342 --> 56:29.469
He truly is such a brave man.

56:35.141 --> 56:36.476
I don't know
what I'll do tomorrow.

56:39.687 --> 56:41.314
You can cry.

56:41.314 --> 56:42.148
It's okay.

56:43.608 --> 56:44.567
No, my father,

56:48.571 --> 56:50.198
my father taught me never to cry.

56:53.451 --> 56:56.704
He taught me that only weak people cry.

56:58.331 --> 56:59.999
- Miriam.
- I wanna stay strong.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.877
You are one of the strongest women that

57:03.920 --> 57:05.255
I've ever known.

57:07.298 --> 57:08.675
You'll be okay.

57:10.051 --> 57:11.094
Open up 2114.

57:16.933 --> 57:18.184
Berhenti

57:24.607 --> 57:27.443
The tribunal has rejected
your final clemency.

57:27.443 --> 57:28.820
You're out of options.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.697
You will be executed tomorrow night.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.115
This is insane.

57:33.408 --> 57:34.993
Any last meal requests?

57:36.077 --> 57:37.036
No.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.581
Very well, no last meal.

57:39.581 --> 57:40.957
What about your belongings?

57:42.542 --> 57:45.420
Just give 'em away, I don't care.

57:45.420 --> 57:47.005
Very well, your belongings
will be discarded

57:47.005 --> 57:48.548
in the trash bin.

57:48.548 --> 57:49.382
Good day.

57:49.382 --> 57:50.258
Good luck to you.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.532
I'll have the rifles clean and ready, sir.

58:14.532 --> 58:15.825
Good.

58:15.825 --> 58:18.620
You may have to get four
guards to drag that coward out.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.330
You think so?

58:21.581 --> 58:24.042
He's a sniveling, pathetic coward.

58:24.042 --> 58:25.210
That is all.

58:25.210 --> 58:26.044
Yes, sir.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.763
I can't believe it.

58:38.348 --> 58:39.766
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.311
I'm so sorry, Liu.

58:46.856 --> 58:48.650
I know you must be scared right now.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.070
I won't exist after tomorrow, I’m...

58:53.530 --> 58:54.489
Listen to me,

58:54.489 --> 58:55.615
just please listen to me.

58:55.615 --> 58:56.574
Just this one time.

58:57.617 --> 59:00.203
Right now, you're in
between Heaven and Hell.

59:00.203 --> 59:03.915
Two destinations, and you
choose where you want to end up.

59:03.915 --> 59:06.125
But let me tell you, eternity is forever.

59:07.001 --> 59:08.670
It's nice knowing you, Peter.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.547
I'm just terrified of dying.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.631
I don’t...

59:11.631 --> 59:14.050
Liu I'm gonna be
praying for you brother.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.511
And I want you to take my Bible, please.

59:17.428 --> 59:19.180
No, no.

59:19.180 --> 59:21.599
It's okay, I'm gonna read
something else tonight.

59:51.296 --> 59:54.090
Everybody... step out.

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.896
Mr. Lynbrook and Mr. Liu Fat

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:11.232
are gonna be executed tonight.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:12.650
You may say goodbye to them.

01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:17.405
Mr. Fat, come on out.

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.489
No, no, no.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.534
No, I don't wanna die.

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:22.535
No.

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:23.536
Stop fighting.

01:00:23.536 --> 01:00:24.662
Take it like a man.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:25.496
What's wrong with you?

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:26.331
Take him.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.665
No, no, no, no, no, please,

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:29.500
I don't wanna die.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.626
Please.

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:31.753
Don't.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.921
- Please.
- Pastor Lynbrook.

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:38.926
Goodbye, Ceasar.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:43.681
It's been an honor, sir.

01:00:43.681 --> 01:00:44.515
Thanks Peter.

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:45.350
I'm going home.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:48.770
Paul, God bless.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.858
James, God bless you.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:55.360
Enough yaking.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.694
Let's go.

01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:57.528
Move!

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:46.577
Berhenti

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:48.621
Stand by.

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.964
I think you're gonna
need the handkerchief.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.383
No, please, please don't do this.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.717
This is insane.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:02.844
Cry baby, cry.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.889
Liu, there's still a chance for you

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.558
to accept Jesus Christ.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.726
No, I don't want to die.

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:11.853
Mr. Liu Fat,

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.397
you've been found guilty of
drug offenses in our country

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.774
and will now be executed by firing squad.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:17.984
Any last words?

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.235
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.486
I just made a mistake.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.114
Pathetic.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.784
Handkerchief?

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.494
No, thank you.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.496
Mr. Lynwood,

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:33.040
you've been found guilty
of murder in our country

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.042
and will be executed by firing squad.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:36.252
Any last words?

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:38.337
No sir.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.556
Please, I don't wanna die.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.437
Get ready.

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:58.065
Get that clown on his feet.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.651
No, no.

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:01.527
No.

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:03.196
Fall back.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.156
Take it like a man.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.576
Pathetic.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.119
Can't you see he's suffering.

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:19.629
I prayed I would
show courage when I die.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.589
I had no idea what I would do.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.633
Aim.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.015
Pastor Lynbrook died
with his Bible in his hands.

01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:33.184
And he went to Heaven much like Steven.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.811
Maybe he never felt the bullets.

01:03:35.853 --> 01:03:37.563
It was very scary.

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:39.690
Who knows how any of us would react.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.317
Maybe I'd go out like him.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.151
I'm no better.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.957
Your friend died like a squealing pig.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:59.085
Just crying and sniveling all the way down

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.212
and screamed as we blindfolded him.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:02.380
Just,

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.298
just truly pathetic soul.

01:04:05.883 --> 01:04:07.218
He was a human being.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.472
Your pastor friend,

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.766
he was strangely calm.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.769
'Cause he's in Heaven.

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:22.858
Your tribunal orders comes
tonight deciding your fate.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.987
Are you scared?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.656
No.

01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:29.949
I'm at peace.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.495
You're at peace because
your Jesus will save you?

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:37.415
If I have God behind me,

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:40.251
what is there to be scared of?

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.755
How can you believe in a God

01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:48.342
and in a Jesus when they're not
here to stop your execution?

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.138
Peter, come here.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:52.972
Come here.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.271
Deny your Christ,

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:02.857
I'll set you free.

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:06.360
I'm sorry.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.821
I can't and I won't do that.

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:14.410
You know, if one seed dies,

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.703
another one blossoms.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:18.289
Wow.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.916
So I offer you freedom

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.543
and you'll still die for Christ?

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:24.629
Absolutely.

01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:30.217
And I'm not gonna be mad at
you for sending me to my death.

01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:33.429
I just want you to know that.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.780
There has to be something
we can do, Mr. Markman.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.574
He's, he's a changed person.

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:54.992
Oh, I'm sorry, Miriam.

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.913
I've spoken with the
president of Indonesia.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.414
He refuses to give a pardon,

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:02.541
there's really nothing
more I can get done.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:04.585
- I'm so sorry.
- Why?

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.464
Well, maybe he wants to
make an example of Peter

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:11.759
to show all drug dealers
that you cannot venture here.

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:15.972
They do have zero drug
tolerance, zero.

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.558
It's, it's not fair.

01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:20.768
He's a changed person.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.478
He's a new man.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:23.854
A new

01:06:23.854 --> 01:06:25.856
creation.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.441
A what?

01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:28.776
A new man for Christ.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:33.280
Well, I have heard only
good things about him,

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.200
so maybe he is a changed man.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:38.285
What about,

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:39.620
what about Amnesty International?

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.454
Oh, I don't think so.

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:42.331
- Would they help anything?
- Not at this late date.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.124
No.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:47.086
I'm sorry, there's really
nothing more we can do.

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:49.213
I'm so sorry.

01:07:13.237 --> 01:07:14.488
Lord, Heavenly Father,

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.158
I pray to you today to

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.744
guide us tomorrow.

01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:23.164
Give us strength

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.374
as we face death.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.335
Help us not to be afraid,

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:32.214
as we know that we are going
to be coming to your kingdom.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.259
What are they doing?

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.594
They're praying, sir.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:37.428
They're praying.

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:40.848
Then they're praying to the air then.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:43.017
He's still gonna get
executed tomorrow night.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.644
Even the US Embassy can't help them.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.107
5482, stay outta trouble.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:58.866
That's all I can pray right now.

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:01.911
I'm so sorry.

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:04.789
I'm trying not to cry.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.707
It's, it's, it's okay.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.586
It don't want you to hold it in, it’s...

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.879
I'm at peace.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.560
What about mercy, sir?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.313
What about mercy for our people?

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:31.899
They brought drugs in here.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:32.733
Correct?

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:34.610
Yes, but...

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:39.031
We cannot show clemency, unfortunately.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:41.408
It sends a bad message

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:44.620
to all the drug dealers around the world.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.039
Yes, but surely they're changed men.

01:08:47.039 --> 01:08:48.290
Maybe.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.959
But who cares?

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.752
This is all after the fact.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:55.297
We are setting a deterrent factor.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.426
Death penalty is a deterrent.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.970
It saves lives

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.555
and stops our people

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.307
from dying from drug overdoses.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.269
That is very common in your country.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.104
Correct?

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:17.319
The President will not
commute their sentences

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.406
and they're slated to be
executed tonight, Bob.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:21.574
Thank you, Jessica.

01:09:21.574 --> 01:09:24.493
Has there been any international reaction?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.453
World leaders and the Pope

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.956
have all sent the President
their protests, but

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.541
it looks to be to no avail.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.837
And what is the
prisoner's outlook on all this?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.005
Well, believe it or not,

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.632
they seem calm, Bob.

01:09:38.632 --> 01:09:39.550
Calm.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:40.551
How can that be?

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.512
They say they have a savior
and that gives them hope.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.098
Hmm.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:49.268
Well, the execution is
scheduled for tonight

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:51.228
by firing squad.

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:53.606
I'm Bob Kendruff from New York.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:54.440
Goodnight.

01:09:57.818 --> 01:10:00.404
They're not gonna stop
this execution, Miriam.

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:01.447
I'm at peace with it.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:04.033
I'm gonna meet the Lord.

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:10.998
And I know I keep saying this
to you over and over again,

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.168
but it's okay to cry.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.586
It really is.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.671
I can't cry.

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:21.300
I don't know, I think there's
something wrong with me.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:27.848
I know you're going to go be Jesus.

01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:29.183
And that brings me comfort.

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:31.685
Oh, it’s...

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.313
Miriam.

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:38.400
Would you like to get married to me?

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:40.736
What?

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:43.405
Will you marry me, Miriam?

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:48.160
Yes, of course.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.370
Peter, when?

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.204
Now.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.038
There's no tomorrow.

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:53.916
Sure.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:54.750
I'd be honored.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.214
Amazing.

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.048
I, um...

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.218
there's something I haven't told you.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.096
The reason I can't cry.

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:11.725
When I was 12,

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.187
my father committed suicide.

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.902
My mother asked me not
to cry, so I didn't.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:24.822
And I haven't cried since.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.826
I guess maybe that's what's wrong with me.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:33.080
Sorry.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.374
I guess you fell in love
with a crazy woman.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.127
Don't be so stupid.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.962
You're not crazy.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.089
You are amazing.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:42.923
I mean,

01:11:43.924 --> 01:11:47.302
you're, you're the most
incredible woman I've ever met.

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:49.054
I can't put it into words.

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:51.265
And listen, don't be sad.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:52.349
Don't be down, that,

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:56.103
about the result that's
gonna happen tomorrow.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:56.937
I,

01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.440
I'm gonna be in a better place

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.692
and I'm gonna be with you.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:03.736
I know,

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:05.988
and

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:09.825
you will always be my husband.

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:11.910
And you'll always be my wife.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.418
Ah, Eddie.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.504
Listen, I,

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.922
I need you to marry us.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:24.757
Wow, sure.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:27.217
That's the greatest thing I've heard.

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:28.052
Well.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.137
I need to get a ring so.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.680
I can get one from the girls.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.514
Thank you.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:34.892
What's up, Eddie?

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:36.351
What's up?

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.186
Eddie, I,

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:40.814
I've been meaning to ask you,

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:44.943
I want you to take over the chapel

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:45.778
whilst I'm,

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.529
I'm gone.

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:50.032
Peter, I mean...

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:53.786
Wait.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:54.912
No, Peter, Peter,

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:57.790
I've been coming here for eight years.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.749
Eight years.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.542
I mean, I, I can't even speak.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:01.627
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.088
I said the same thing to Pastor Lynbrook

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:04.963
when he asked me.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.220
Peter, I don't think they're gonna listen.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.054
They will.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.224
Just trust in God and they'll come.

01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:17.768
Okay?

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:18.977
Okay, Peter,

01:13:18.977 --> 01:13:19.812
I'll try.

01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:22.564
I'm not very good.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:23.982
You've seen me preach.

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:25.484
No one ever comes forward.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:26.610
Eddie.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.070
You are the man for this job.

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:30.239
Just trust me.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.744
I'm gonna miss you, Peter.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.913
I'm gonna miss you too, brother.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.624
Now look, we've got a wedding to do.

01:13:40.624 --> 01:13:41.458
Come on, let's go.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.292
Let's go.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:47.256
Miriam, do you take this man

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.550
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.218
Yes, I do.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.303
Peter, do you take this woman

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.888
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.141
I do.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.518
So by the power invested in me,

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:01.270
I pronounce you man and wife.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:08.610
What's the report?

01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:11.405
Well, they just got married, Captain.

01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:15.492
Some things are unexplainably stupid.

01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:18.662
He gets executed tomorrow
and she still marries him.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.247
Well, I mean, she loves him.

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:21.748
Again, stupid.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:24.334
But why is that so stupid, sir?

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:27.462
Love is stupid.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:29.673
Let's go.

01:14:49.234 --> 01:14:51.028
I am gonna miss you, Peter.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.237
We had some great talks.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.574
I'm gonna miss you too, Tanu.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.913
Entire media is
covering you outside.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.958
That's not a bad thing, you know.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.793
The world will see that I'm at peace.

01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:09.796
Hmm?

01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:11.548
You

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.010
almost made me wanna
convert to Christianity.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.598
You know, King Agrippa said the same thing

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.767
to apostle Paul many years ago.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:25.771
Oh.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:28.690
I've read about your Paul in the Bible.

01:15:30.275 --> 01:15:32.277
I do have my doubts about the Bible, but

01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.364
I don't doubt your strong faith, Peter.

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:52.381
This is not goodbye, guys.

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:54.883
We will see you again in Heaven.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.636
You know, Jesus said that in His house,

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.845
there are many mansions

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.181
and He will come again.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:07.020
Well, I do want to leave you
with just one song today.

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.897
One song that is dear to my heart

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.526

The prisoners and guards

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.058
were to overcome with emotion
to sing "Amazing Grace".

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:09.851
I understood why.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:18.485
Hallelujah.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.070

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.417
Thank you so much, Peter and Samuel.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:34.501
It was very brave of you

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.211
to sing your final song for us.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.091
Will anyone like to accept the
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:42.092
please come forward.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.681
Okay.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.683
Well that concludes our service.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:50.767
May God bless you all.

01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:56.189
You're gonna be great, Eddie.

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:58.400
I don't think I can do this, Peter.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.734
What did I say?

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:00.694
Just trust in the Lord.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:01.528
- Yes, I know.
- And they will come.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:02.696
Okay.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:03.738
All right, trust God.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:08.285
Peter,

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:10.871
you're a changed man.

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:14.541

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:17.127

I wish I could believe that.

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.595
What's the point in executing you?

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.181
What's the point?

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.599
Hey, quiet there.

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:34.478
Peter, it's time to be taken

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:38.356
to the center for tonight's execution.

01:19:38.356 --> 01:19:39.191
I'm sorry.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:53.079

01:20:19.689 --> 01:20:21.441
Everybody step out.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.461
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Lone are
gonna be executed tonight.

01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:43.880
You may say goodbye to them.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.133
Mr. Lone, step on out.

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:48.677

01:24:15.967 --> 01:24:16.801
Aim.

01:24:18.636 --> 01:24:19.471
Fire.

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:23.183
Fire.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:26.644
Fire.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:30.273
What's wrong with you guys?

01:24:30.273 --> 01:24:31.149
I said fire.

01:24:34.527 --> 01:24:36.362
If you soldiers do not shoot him,

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:39.574
I'll put you on the other side
and I'll shoot you myself.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.867
You got that soldiers?

01:24:42.702 --> 01:24:43.536
Ready.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:46.247
Aim.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:51.419
Fire!

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:38.633
Why am I here?

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:39.843
You can't do your own job?

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:42.053
It's past curfew.

01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:43.930
Get back in your cells.

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.349
No wait, come back outta your cells.

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.144
Line up, you maggots.

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:52.814
Why do you have this beanie?

01:25:54.357 --> 01:25:57.360
What are you looking at, four eyes?

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.030
Out of your cell.

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:02.949
Do you understand English?

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:04.367
Out of your cell.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.248
You.

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:11.791
I told both of you to cut your hair.

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:13.668
Why didn't you cut your hair, huh?

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:15.003
You too good for us?

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:17.338
Get inside your cell.

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.631
How about you join your brother.

01:26:18.631 --> 01:26:19.507
Get inside.

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:25.722
What are you wearing in your ear?

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.516
Is that a cross?

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:29.767
Huh?

01:26:29.767 --> 01:26:30.977
Are you a Christian, huh?

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.979
Are you like Pastor Lynbrook?

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.147
Are you like Peter?

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:35.023
Get outta my way.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.777
You're lucky to be touched by an angel.

01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:42.614
Maggots.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:43.865
Vermin.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.825
Get inside your cells.

01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:47.994
You're all going to hell.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.593
Miriam, where are you going?

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:04.427
I don't know.

01:27:05.678 --> 01:27:07.847
But my work here is done.

01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:10.016
But you've done
so much for us here.

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.769
I don't think I did, Eddie.

01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:16.856
I would've loved to have won
more people to Christ, but

01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:19.776
I'm so glad that I met you.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:25.865
He,

01:27:27.533 --> 01:27:30.370
he wanted me to, to give you this.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.511
Dear Miriam, my love.

01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:48.846
I wanted you to read this.

01:27:50.014 --> 01:27:51.307
By now I'm in Heaven.

01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:54.477
But I wanted you to
know that God loves you.

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.688
And Romans 8:28 really does matter.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.482
All things work together for good.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:03.152
I'm writing this quick
note as they take me away.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:05.613
Jesus loves you

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:06.864
and I'll always love you.

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:08.992
Take care, my love.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:13.746
What?

01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:14.831
What does it say?

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.002
He's in a great place now.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:20.878
I know.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.382
Miriam, it's okay.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:25.216
You, you can cry.

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:26.384
I'm not gonna say nothing.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:31.597
I don't cry.

01:28:32.932 --> 01:28:34.350
I'm not built like that.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.145
I guess I,

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:40.690
Guess I have to give the message today.

01:28:42.525 --> 01:28:43.985
Will you come with me?

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.570
Sure.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:46.946
Hey, you're gonna do great.

01:28:46.946 --> 01:28:48.698
Thank you.

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:50.199
Okay, see you there.

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.075
See you, Eddie.

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:52.952
See you there.

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:01.419
And as we close this morning,

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.756
let us remain steadfast

01:29:05.631 --> 01:29:08.176
and the love of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ.

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:11.846
As you all know,

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.973
Miriam will be leaving us.

01:29:13.973 --> 01:29:15.933
She served us well when Peter was here.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:18.853
We'll miss her very much.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.192
I know I'm not a good speaker

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.068
like Peter.

01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:30.156
Who wants to accept the Lord and Savior

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:31.491
Jesus Christ this morning?

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.209
Okay,

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:45.088
I guess we'll wrap up this service this

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:46.005
morning.

Hello friends, I'm Kevin Sorbo.

01:34:58.150 --> 01:34:59.568
The movie you just saw me in

01:34:59.568 --> 01:35:03.197
is based on real events
that happened in 2015.

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:06.409
These men faced death and they chose life.

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:09.328
I wanna invite you to do what
those prisoners just did.

01:35:09.328 --> 01:35:10.413
Choose life.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:11.580
Choose Jesus.

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.166
He'll give you the strength
to face every challenge,

01:35:14.166 --> 01:35:17.086
and He'll bring new life
out of that challenge.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:18.754
You can have that now,

01:35:18.754 --> 01:35:19.755
tonight.

01:35:19.755 --> 01:35:21.090
Just pray out to Him

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.968
and receive Him as your personal savior.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:25.136
Do it now.

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:27.847
Tomorrow is guaranteed to no one.

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.640
God bless your decision tonight

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.643
and get involved in a
Bible believing church.

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:34.395
God bless.
