the security guards.

with seduction.

with seduction.

get past the orderlies.

with seduction.

-Yes.

-We're here to spray
the urine aroma.
-Oh, okay.

I was smelling other things
than urine.

Sounds like we're here
just in the nick of time.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.374
I assure you, when we're done,
it'll all be urine.

as you made it out to be.

you got your eyes checked?

I thought if you shampoo them
every night,

you didn't have to
get them checked.

in the weeds about it.

to joke about

as a good deed.

Well, I gotta say,
it feels pretty good

20:28.794 --> 20:31.864
doing something nice
for a sweet old woman
on Christmas.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.866
It's like that thing about
when a bell rings

20:33.866 --> 20:35.668
and an angel gets its wings.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.336
What? What's that?

20:37.336 --> 20:38.838
From It's a Wonderful Life.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.439
Oh, yeah, no,
I've never seen that.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.808
You've never seen
It's a Wonderful Life?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.443
It starts with
a big, loud bell,

20:44.443 --> 20:46.145
and I got scared
and turned it off.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.780
Peter, it's a classic.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.348
It's about
a mortgage lender...

20:49.348 --> 20:50.716
Always
a sympathetic character.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.051
...who's an angry drunk

20:52.051 --> 20:54.553
and winds up
threatening to commit suicide

20:54.553 --> 20:56.489
after he DUIs into a tree.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.390
Actually,
that sounds hilarious.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.492
Let's watch it tonight.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.061
Oh, it's a date, Mr. Griffin.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.932
