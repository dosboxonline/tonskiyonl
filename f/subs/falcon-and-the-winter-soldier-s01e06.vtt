-I'm back! I'm back! I'm back! I'm back!
-(CHUCKLING)

35:36.833 --> 35:37.833
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:42.042 --> 35:44.250
Hey, what are you doing here?

35:45.250 --> 35:47.708
It's late,
come in before someone call the cops.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.792
What are you doing here?
It's not Wednesday.

35:58.625 --> 36:01.417
I, uh, I have to tell you something.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.500
About your son.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.167
He was murdered.

36:15.750 --> 36:16.833
What?

36:18.125 --> 36:19.708
By the Winter Soldier.

36:23.542 --> 36:24.708
(VOICE SHAKING) And that was me.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.000
Why?

36:29.542 --> 36:30.667
(INHALES)

36:32.792 --> 36:34.167
I didn't have a choice.

38:01.417 --> 38:02.417
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

38:09.208 --> 38:10.458
What you want, Black Falcon?

38:10.542 --> 38:12.375
Hey, you need to learn some manners.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.333
ISAIAH: He ain't a Falcon anymore,

38:16.792 --> 38:17.917
but he's still Black.

38:24.958 --> 38:26.500
I saw what you did out there.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.917
And it seems, so did everyone else.

38:33.083 --> 38:36.667
I heard the GRC was standing down
on those plans of theirs,

38:36.750 --> 38:38.875
so you must have done somethin' right.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.583
I ain't gonna lie.

38:46.583 --> 38:47.583
You're special.

38:50.250 --> 38:51.250
Thank you.

38:52.875 --> 38:57.292
I mean, you ain't no Malcolm,
Martin, Mandela, but...

38:57.375 --> 38:58.458
No argument there.

38:59.125 --> 39:00.708
But I know what I've gotta do.

39:02.750 --> 39:05.750
So, a Black Captain America, huh?

39:07.042 --> 39:08.167
Damn right.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.708
(CHUCKLES)

39:11.792 --> 39:15.000
The fight you taking on
ain't gonna be easy, Sam.

39:16.542 --> 39:17.583
SAM: Yeah, I might fail.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.458
Shit, I might die.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.458
But...

39:23.125 --> 39:24.250
We built this country.

39:25.083 --> 39:26.167
Bled for it.

39:27.708 --> 39:30.375
I'm not gonna let
anybody tell me I can't fight for it.

39:31.625 --> 39:34.208
Not after what everybody
before me went through.

39:34.292 --> 39:35.542
Including you.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.417
(VOICE SHAKING) Shit.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.125
I almost bought that.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.000
Man, do you ever lighten up?

39:47.083 --> 39:48.167
Nope.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.333
-Mm-mmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

39:54.167 --> 39:55.917
Hey, why don't you clean up?
There's, um...

39:57.500 --> 39:58.833
Somethin' I wanna show you.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.875
So, uh, where we going?

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

41:06.625 --> 41:10.083
Now, they'll never forget
what you did for this country.

41:12.083 --> 41:13.125
Never.

41:31.083 --> 41:33.083
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

41:43.292 --> 41:44.417
Oh! There he is!

41:48.750 --> 41:49.875
Where is everybody?

SENATOR: On behalf of
the United States Intelligence Community,

44:51.167 --> 44:54.167
I'd like to offer you
and your family our sincerest apologies.

44:55.417 --> 44:59.000
The Carter name has always been
synonymous with service and trust.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.208
Today, we begin to set things right.

45:01.750 --> 45:04.333
We begin to repay
some of the debt that is owed to you.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.125
Thank you, Senator.

45:07.583 --> 45:10.208
I've been waiting
to hear those words for a long time.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.208
And we'd like to offer you a full pardon.

45:14.125 --> 45:16.375
There may be
an opening in your old division.

45:17.250 --> 45:19.292
Is that something you'd be interested in?

45:20.792 --> 45:21.875
It would be my honor.

45:23.958 --> 45:25.500
Welcome home, Agent Carter.

45:45.042 --> 45:46.667
Start lining up our buyers.

45:46.750 --> 45:48.583
Super Soldiers might be off the menu,

45:48.667 --> 45:53.333
but we're about to have full access
to government secrets, prototype weapons,

45:53.417 --> 45:54.667
you name it.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.125
Should be something for everyone.
