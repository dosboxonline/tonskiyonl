WEBVTT

00:43.252 --> 00:46.171
You're all in violation
of your Helios contract!

00:46.755 --> 00:50.217
Every penny lost will be docked
from your pay.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.887
- It is right here in black and white.
- That is such bullshit, Palmer.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.139
Helios is a nonunion shop.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.893
Any strike is grounds
for immediate termination.

00:59.893 --> 01:04.565
Then fire us. See how easy it is to do
literally anything up here without us.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.774
Fair is fair.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.402
These guys put their asses on the line
every single day.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
- That's rich coming from you, Ed.
- They deserve--

01:10.404 --> 01:14.241
I can still hear you whining about how
most of these people aren't even qualified

01:14.241 --> 01:15.659
to be up here in the first place.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.289
But now you're all what?
Down with the common man?

01:20.289 --> 01:22.791
Don't try to make this about me, Dani.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.837
You know as well as I do that Helios,
NASA, Roscosmos

01:26.837 --> 01:28.213
and all the other M-7 countries,

01:28.213 --> 01:30.674
they don't give two shits
about these workers.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.969
Commander Poole,
we are the ones who transformed this base

01:33.969 --> 01:36.763
from a couple of habs
into a viable mining colony.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.641
And all we are asking
is for you to honor the deal.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.478
If we let that rock go to Earth's orbit,
most of our jobs are gone within a year.

01:44.646 --> 01:48.400
What if Helios offered you
some kind of guaranteed retraining?

01:49.193 --> 01:52.237
Right? More education,
an opportunity for you--

01:52.237 --> 01:53.822
Forgive us. Forgive us.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.116
We've heard that one before.
It's never anything but bullshit.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.952
Listen, if you want your cryo center
to start making the fuel

01:58.952 --> 02:00.370
you need to launch for Goldilocks,

02:00.370 --> 02:02.581
if you want your cargo to get unloaded
from <i>Phoenix</i>,

02:02.581 --> 02:05.709
if you want your habitation units to be
constructed or your food prepared, we--

02:05.709 --> 02:10.464
I have gone out of my way
to address your concerns.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.635
Yes, there is some uncertainty
about the future.

02:15.219 --> 02:19.848
Yes, this asteroid is forcing us
to do things quick, fast and in a hurry.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.644
But we have got to restart
that cryo center ASAP.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.649
We need to pump 125 tons of liquid argon

02:28.649 --> 02:32.152
to get <i>Ranger</i> out to Goldilocks
and push her onto the right path.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.238
And so far, we've only got 44 tons.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.114
We are running out of time.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.783
And every day you keep dragging your feet

02:37.783 --> 02:40.494
is another day closer
to letting Goldilocks get away for good.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.995
And then we all lose.

02:42.996 --> 02:43.997
Is that what you want?

02:44.581 --> 02:45.874
No, what we want is--

02:45.874 --> 02:48.669
We want for you to get off
your goddamn throne

02:48.669 --> 02:50.254
and give us what's fair.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.926
Just how far are you willing
to take this, Ed?

02:55.926 --> 02:58.428
The question is
how much are you willing to lose?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.678
These strikers are as driven
as any I've seen.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.388
And I've seen my share.

04:23.388 --> 04:27.059
<i>We cannot allow the progress we made
in Leningrad to go to waste</i>

04:27.059 --> 04:29.978
<i>because of this-- this tantrum.</i>

04:29.978 --> 04:32.189
You're preaching to the choir, Irina.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.360
I got the president asking every hour
if this damn thing's been resolved yet.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.614
Korzhenko is the same.
We must bring this to resolution.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.451
<i>Well, they're not budging,
especially on their biggest demand.</i>

04:45.035 --> 04:49.122
This insane idea that they want Goldilocks
to wind up in Mars orbit,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.416
which is non-negotiable for us.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.043
<i>And for us.</i>

04:53.043 --> 04:55.671
There's only one way I see forward.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.006
We go around them.

04:59.049 --> 05:04.763
Order our cosmonauts, your astronauts to
restart the fuel generators immediately.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.182
Well, they're not exactly trained
on that equipment.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.394
<i>They're engineers. This is the only way.</i>

05:10.394 --> 05:12.312
If Helios will not help us,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.566
we'll have to help ourselves.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.236
You said they'd cave in a couple of sols.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.697
- And it's been a week.
- Shut up, you pussy.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.491
You thought this would be easy?
Gotta hold our ground, man.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.244
He's right.
Our power is in sticking together.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.413
They start peeling us off,
this whole thing crumbles.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.331
Look, I came up here to earn.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.126
And all I know is right now,
I'm not earning nothing.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.920
Yeah, well, neither are they.
And they're starting to panic.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.632
- We have to hold the course here.
- Right. You gotta be strong.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.427
But you heard what Palmer said.
They're gonna shitcan all of us.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.095
They can't. There's no time.

05:46.305 --> 05:50.434
Listen up. I just heard they're gonna try
to start the fuel gennies themselves.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.397
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us.
Are we gonna let that happen?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.816
- Hell no!
- No! No!

06:13.790 --> 06:15.042
Where are all the suits?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.757
Guys, look at this.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.234
So you're telling me
there are no other accessible suits

06:40.234 --> 06:41.401
on this entire base?

06:41.401 --> 06:45.113
Yes, ma'am. And they used the rovers
to block the air locks at the fuel plant.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.907
It's a clever move.
You gotta give it to 'em.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.745
We gotta get creative. Right?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.372
How are we gonna solve this?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.749
We have to get back over
to that cryo center

06:55.749 --> 06:58.961
or we're not gonna have enough fuel
when it comes time to get Goldilocks.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.548
It's just too far a distance
for any sort of improvised pressure suit.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.259
And it's gonna take too long
to make a new one from scratch.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.343
Just stop.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.637
Here we are on the cusp
of grabbing something

07:08.637 --> 07:10.681
that could change everything
for a lot of people,

07:10.681 --> 07:13.767
and we just can't get out
of our own goddamn way.

07:16.103 --> 07:20.524
All right. Well,
what if we went under instead of over?

07:33.537 --> 07:34.663
Smells nice.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.083
That'd be the gray water
from the composting tanks.

07:40.544 --> 07:44.423
Well, it's a little tight,
but I think it can work.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.383
You sure they don't know about this?

07:46.383 --> 07:47.843
It wouldn't even occur to them

07:47.843 --> 07:50.179
that we'd drain the water feed pipe
to the cryo center

07:50.179 --> 07:52.431
and then belly crawl people over there.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.309
But it's gonna take at least
12 hours to fully drain it.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.853
Well, then we better get started.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.358
ROSCOSMOS

08:17.372 --> 08:19.124
Good morning, Miss Madison.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.043
Good morning, Pasha.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.966
<i>We are working with the Americans</i>

08:27.966 --> 08:30.636
to resolve the issues
with the transgressing workers.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.929
I would not trust the Americans.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.015
Helios pretends to be
an international company

08:36.015 --> 08:38.684
but it is based in Houston,
right next to NASA.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.855
They serve the interests of Gore
and his lackeys.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.319
What is so funny?

08:49.238 --> 08:54.117
I have met Dev Ayesa and I promise you

08:54.117 --> 09:00.999
he cares more about his own interests
than America's.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.628
Margo is right.
Our intelligence conveys the same.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.881
Now, while the strike is brought
to a close,

09:07.881 --> 09:13.220
all efforts must continue to ensure
the safe capture of this asteroid

09:13.220 --> 09:15.222
and its return to Earth's orbit

09:15.222 --> 09:18.517
under Margo Madison's direction.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.436
Thank you, Director Morozova.

09:23.230 --> 09:29.236
We have updated
2003LC's projected trajectory,

09:29.236 --> 09:35.909
and Tatyana has now calculated
the optimal intercept for <i>Ranger</i>.

09:36.577 --> 09:40.038
She's done some brilliant work.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.874
Very good.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.501
That will be all.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.545
The meeting is adjourned.
Everyone is dismissed.

09:48.839 --> 09:52.134
Margo Madison... stay behind, please.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.905
The strike will end one way or another.

10:12.905 --> 10:17.409
And we have reached the point
where interfacing directly and in person

10:17.409 --> 10:20.329
with the American capture team
is necessary.

10:21.747 --> 10:27.377
A representative of Roscosmos must go
to Houston to finalize the negotiations.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.215
I agree. And I'll do everything I can
to help prepare them for the trip. So--

10:31.215 --> 10:35.719
President Korzhenko has requested
for you to do this.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.556
I'm sorry?

10:40.057 --> 10:44.686
We have negotiated diplomatic immunity
for you for entire time you're there.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.356
They cannot touch you.
They cannot arrest you.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.733
I don't-- No, no.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.903
I can't go back.
That was not part of our agreement.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.697
The agreement has changed.

10:59.535 --> 11:05.457
It is imperative to the president that
we send our most capable representative.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.501
Oh, come on.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.045
The only reason Korzhenko
wants me to go back

11:10.045 --> 11:12.422
is so he can stick a finger in Gore's eye.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.507
Perhaps.

11:14.424 --> 11:20.013
But still it would be wise
to accept the request.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.901
Now, we're gonna do
a deep dive on this. This stuff with...

11:33.527 --> 11:35.487
Do I need to say 2003LC?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.906
Let's just go with Goldilocks.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.158
Very interested to hear your POV,

11:40.158 --> 11:43.287
and honestly, just what you were thinking
when you saw her.

11:43.287 --> 11:45.414
- Saw who?
- Moscow Margo.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.375
Back from commercial in ten, nine, eight...

11:48.375 --> 11:50.377
I'm not here to talk about Margo Madison.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.462
- ...six, five...
- You'll be great.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.506
...four, three...

11:58.760 --> 12:01.722
Good evening.
Welcome to <i>America Now</i>. I'm Zoey Chase.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.642
Later tonight, a car bomb explodes
at the Kingdom Center tower in Riyadh

12:05.642 --> 12:09.354
as the civil war in Saudi Arabia continues
to rage.

12:09.354 --> 12:14.067
<i>But first, joining me now in
an exclusive interview is Aleida Rosales</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:18.530
<i>from Helios Aerospace who worked
side by side with Margo Madison,</i>

12:18.530 --> 12:20.657
<i>the woman majority leader Feinstein
has called</i>

12:20.657 --> 12:23.619
<i>the worst traitor in American history.</i>

12:23.619 --> 12:25.120
<i>Aleida, welcome.</i>

12:28.707 --> 12:29.750
<i>Thank you, Zoey.</i>

12:30.250 --> 12:33.003
<i>I look forward to discussing
the asteroid 2003LC and--</i>

12:33.003 --> 12:35.964
<i>We'll get to that. First,
tell me about Margo Madison.</i>

12:35.964 --> 12:40.761
<i>For so long she'd been listed amongst the
dead of the Johnson Space Center bombing.</i>

12:40.761 --> 12:42.596
<i>Did you know that she was alive?</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:44.431
<i>No, of course not.</i>

12:44.431 --> 12:47.809
She fucking sandbagged me.
Barely even asked me about the asteroid.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.394
<i>Seven other people were never found.</i>

12:49.394 --> 12:51.146
<i>Do you think they're hiding in Russia too?</i>

12:51.146 --> 12:53.815
<i>And how are you feeling
about her proposed return to Houston?</i>

12:53.815 --> 12:54.900
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

12:54.900 --> 12:56.777
<i>Our source
at the State Department is saying</i>

12:56.777 --> 12:58.946
<i>she'll be granted diplomatic immunity
while here.</i>

12:58.946 --> 13:02.908
<i>I thought... I thought she
wouldn't be allowed back into the country.</i>

13:03.492 --> 13:07.246
<i>No one did.
But you came up under her at NASA.</i>

13:07.246 --> 13:09.414
<i>Her defection couldn't have come
out of nowhere.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:11.041
<i>I mean, I had--</i>

13:11.041 --> 13:14.837
<i>Did you have a sense that she was working
for the Soviets behind the scenes?</i>

13:14.837 --> 13:17.798
<i>You know what I get a sense of?
That you're a **** hack of a reporter.</i>

13:17.798 --> 13:20.133
- Okay. Give me that.
- <i>You're **** not doing this, okay--</i>

13:21.301 --> 13:22.636
Mom, I--

13:22.636 --> 13:24.680
It was just starting to get good.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.229
How you doing?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.313
I'm fine.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.985
The interview wasn't that bad.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.864
In fact, my brother texted me
saying how much he loved it

13:41.864 --> 13:44.283
when you flipped her off
as you were leaving.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.577
- I did?
- Yeah.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.079
I mean, he said
it was all fuzzed out, but...

13:53.250 --> 13:55.544
This will all blow over in no time.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.338
I don't care about the interview, Vic.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.425
It's her. Margo.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.846
When I first saw her...

14:08.390 --> 14:11.518
I was so happy she was alive. You know?

14:12.728 --> 14:14.062
I couldn't believe it.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.359
But now that she's coming back, I just...

14:21.278 --> 14:22.821
I wish she was still dead...

14:25.157 --> 14:26.158
but she's not.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.911
She's coming back.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.872
She's coming back here.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.875
I know. It's insane.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.586
You gotta do something.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.923
- What can I do?
- Oh, I don't know.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.886
Maybe take a cue
from the folks up on Mars.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.472
Push back.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.813
Hopper 3<i>,</i> Phoenix,
<i>you're clear to disengage.</i>

14:56.813 --> 15:00.150
<i>Clearing clean separation.
You are clear of docking zone.</i>

15:00.150 --> 15:03.320
<i>We have a good transponder mark
and you are clear to maneuver.</i>

15:04.279 --> 15:07.866
<i>Happy Valley flight control
has your landing at beacon 1-5.</i>

15:07.866 --> 15:10.827
Phoenix<i>,</i> Hopper 3
<i>reading you five by five.</i>

15:10.827 --> 15:15.165
<i>Board is green and we're on track
for nominal entry at 0217.</i>

15:15.874 --> 15:18.585
Zero down range. EDL surge on.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.296
Almost through the chop, folks.

15:22.631 --> 15:26.552
<i>You've got a good acceleration profile
and excellent engine performance.</i>

15:30.681 --> 15:33.642
Squeeze my hand. You're doing so good.

15:35.477 --> 15:38.438
Hey, little man.
What you're feeling now is just turbulence

15:38.438 --> 15:41.483
as we enter Mars's atmosphere.
Same as on an airplane.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.113
Looks like we're through the rough patch.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.698
Smooth sailing from here on in.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.450
We'll be on the surface
in a few minutes, folks.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.994
You see that canyon down there?

15:53.245 --> 15:54.705
That's Valles Marineris.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.707
It is four times bigger
than the Grand Canyon,

15:56.707 --> 15:58.792
and our new home is at the bottom of it.

16:00.544 --> 16:04.047
Hopper 3<i>, you're clear
for final approach on beacon 1-5.</i>

16:05.132 --> 16:08.635
<i>Roger that.</i> Hopper 3 <i>is clear
for final approach on beacon 1-5.</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:21.607
Welcome to Happy Valley.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.150
Danielle.

16:27.321 --> 16:31.742
And you must be the young Luke Skywalker.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.285
It's Alex, Mrs. Poole.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.661
Okay.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.749
And you may be our youngest crew member,

16:38.749 --> 16:42.002
but that doesn't mean
we don't have high expectations for you.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.005
...grown so much
since the last time I saw you.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.089
Sir.

16:46.882 --> 16:47.883
Welcome.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.220
I cannot begin to tell you
how happy I am to have you here.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.598
I wish there was
a little bit more of a welcome,

16:54.598 --> 16:56.975
but with the strike...

16:56.975 --> 16:58.977
It's fine. I prefer it this way.

16:59.937 --> 17:03.649
- We haven't quite figured out...
- Give me a sec, Kel.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.193
...how to get everyone's stowed gear
off the transport.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.863
If you'd like to come with me, I can show
you your quarters, maybe give you a tour

17:09.863 --> 17:11.990
- around the facilities--
- Belay that, XO.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.286
You and me, we need to talk.
There have been some new developments.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.496
This way.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.579
Welcome.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.460
Palmer here will get you anything
you need and show you to your quarters.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.878
Welcome.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.339
Here. Let me get that for you.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.091
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.134
All right. Follow me.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.096
Mommy. Where's Poppy?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.848
Oh, I'm sure
he just got a little delayed--

17:35.848 --> 17:37.140
Kel!

17:38.141 --> 17:39.142
Dad.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.021
Hey.

17:46.650 --> 17:47.985
Sorry, I'm a little late.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.239
There's my grandson.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.827
- Alex, it's Poppy.
- Hey.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.454
You wanna give Poppy a hug, kiddo?

18:00.747 --> 18:01.999
No?

18:03.667 --> 18:06.587
He gets like this sometimes.
Probably just a little overwhelmed.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.338
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.758
That's okay, buddy.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.637
Come on, you two.
Let's get you settled then.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.722
Okay.

18:20.434 --> 18:21.977
Palmer. Finally useful.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.357
That's quite the view.

18:28.859 --> 18:32.988
Look, I know
this is all new and exciting for you,

18:33.739 --> 18:36.700
but right now we're working on a way
to get over to the cryo center.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.952
We've got a crisis on our hands.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.872
And it's not just a NASA problem
or an M-7 problem.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.082
These are your workers.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.336
They've got legitimate grievances
against your company.

18:47.336 --> 18:49.588
So I'd like to know
how you plan to proceed.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.050
I am considering my options.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.969
You've had plenty of time
to consider your options.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.639
We gotta get this thing resolved now.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.891
Or that asteroid becomes a distant memory.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.186
Thank you for showing me to my quarters,
Commander Poole.

19:04.895 --> 19:05.896
Much appreciated.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.286
Dev, I know
you're used to being in charge,

19:22.037 --> 19:24.248
but when you're up here on my base,

19:25.207 --> 19:27.626
what I say goes. Clear?

19:28.877 --> 19:29.878
Crystal.

19:37.928 --> 19:38.971
In.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.807
Out.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.394
Good. Now other side.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.693
Good.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.736
I'd like to run some blood work.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.573
Don't worry. Not today.

19:59.575 --> 20:03.495
Did you know I worked with your father
for two and a half years?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.205
Even right here.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.207
Did you like him?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.376
I liked him very much.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.461
He loved playing games,

20:12.546 --> 20:13.964
and he would always beat me.

20:14.715 --> 20:19.219
He would find anything around,
nuts, bolts, candy for the queen,

20:19.219 --> 20:20.971
and use them as chess pieces.

20:21.889 --> 20:22.890
I know chess.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.225
I thought you might.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.310
Maybe we could play?

20:27.853 --> 20:29.438
He's doing quite well.

20:29.438 --> 20:30.731
Low gravity suits him.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.941
Comparing his charts from Houston,

20:32.941 --> 20:35.986
both his blood pressure and respiration
are actually stronger.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.447
He's more at home here than on Earth.

20:39.573 --> 20:40.574
Thank you, Dima.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.409
So good to see you again.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.661
Both of you.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.246
You too.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.754
Keep moving. Stay together.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.968
Christ. This feels like
the longest 800 meters on Mars.

21:00.636 --> 21:04.598
If you'd rather walk out there
without a suit on, be my guest.

21:04.598 --> 21:09.019
It's okay, Jennings.
You get scared, I'll hold your hand.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.312
Fuck off, Bishop.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.397
Quit yakking and keep moving.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.638
Ops-Com, Entry Team 1, we have
reached the main fuel generator control.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.056
Good.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.140
Mr. Howard.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.855
Run a systems check and
have them bring everything back up online.

21:52.855 --> 21:54.648
Entry Team 1, Ops-Com,

21:54.648 --> 21:58.193
you are good to proceed
with reactivation of argon liquefaction

21:58.193 --> 22:00.028
<i>and methane generation.</i>

22:00.028 --> 22:04.366
Time to start making some of that sweet,
sweet galactic go-juice.

22:07.995 --> 22:08.996
How is it?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.248
- Good.
- Yeah?

22:11.248 --> 22:12.332
Real good.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.171
I don't know.
I feel like it's missing something.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.922
Yeah.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.301
Can't quite put my finger on it.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.226
Oh, wow.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.771
Oh, you done good, kiddo.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.860
Oh, yeah.

22:41.695 --> 22:42.863
Oh, yeah.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.990
- You want some of this, buddy?
- No, thank you.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.701
It's the best.
You're gonna love it. You gotta try this.

22:47.701 --> 22:50.287
Oh, there you go. Yeah.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.914
Now mix it up.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.707
You gotta mix it.

23:01.673 --> 23:02.966
Why'd you do that?

23:03.967 --> 23:04.968
It was cheese.

23:06.845 --> 23:10.390
I'm trying to broaden his horizons
a little bit.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.892
Well, maybe before you do that,

23:11.892 --> 23:14.061
you can actually try to get to know him
a little bit,

23:14.061 --> 23:15.896
instead of playing Norma Rae.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.525
- I'm trying here. Okay?
- Are you?

23:19.525 --> 23:23.695
Cut me some slack here, kiddo.
I'm fighting for something here.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.614
I'm Helios too.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.659
So come fight with us.

23:28.659 --> 23:29.743
With me.

23:32.829 --> 23:36.500
You're being so myopic.
There's more than one way to see this.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.337
Aleida Rosales,
she worked a miracle in Leningrad.

23:40.337 --> 23:43.966
Okay. She came up with something
that will change our planet forever.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.636
Yeah. And it'll end everything
we worked for on this one.

23:47.636 --> 23:50.180
There will still be
a robust research presence here.

23:50.180 --> 23:53.392
They're not just gonna fold up
and go home.

23:53.392 --> 23:55.853
That's my point exactly.

23:55.853 --> 23:59.189
It'll end up being
some scientific backwater like McMurdo.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.858
What's wrong with McMurdo?

24:00.858 --> 24:03.527
Nothing. But this place could just be
so much more

24:03.527 --> 24:06.280
than 10 white-coats and a cleaning lady.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.906
It can be a real colony.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.117
A home.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.120
You already have a home.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.965
Skipper, we got a problem.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.769
Why is it that you're the only one

24:37.769 --> 24:39.396
- who doesn't get it?
- All right.

24:41.023 --> 24:44.735
Well, we are fucked now, man.
All our leverage is in that fuel plant.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.362
- How'd they get to it?
- We don't know.

24:48.030 --> 24:51.867
Well, they'll have a tough time starting
those gennies back up without this guy.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.289
The primary gas flow regulator?

24:58.290 --> 25:00.751
Grabbed it when we were clearing out
just in case.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.588
All right,
the voltage limiter is back online.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.590
Copy that. Here we go.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.721
No joy. The intake pipes don't seem
to be flowing atmo into the chamber.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.181
All right. Hold.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.100
Jennings, check the condenser.

25:25.901 --> 25:26.902
Take a look.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.659
They took out
the primary gas flow regulator.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.870
I'm gonna try rerouting the flow
through the secondary.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.832
You can't just bypass a regulator.

25:40.832 --> 25:44.795
Relax. Where I grew up,
missing parts were all in a day's work.

25:44.795 --> 25:46.797
All we did was find work-arounds.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.620
Okay. Try now.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.300
Bingo party.

26:31.842 --> 26:35.429
<i>Beautiful. The argon generators
are coming back online.</i>

26:43.061 --> 26:46.356
Commander, some of
these readings are starting to tip red.

26:48.275 --> 26:49.484
What the hell?

26:57.159 --> 26:59.661
Shut it down. Tell him to shut it down.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.622
Hit the emergency cut-off breaker!

27:22.267 --> 27:26.438
Ms. Rosales, did we have a meeting
scheduled with Administrator Hobson?

27:27.147 --> 27:28.148
We need to talk.

27:32.319 --> 27:35.239
All right. Let me just sign this.
I'll tell you, at NASA, the--

27:35.239 --> 27:37.449
Do not give Margo Madison
diplomatic immunity.

27:37.449 --> 27:39.451
- Just jumping right in. Okay.
- You need to call

27:39.451 --> 27:42.663
the Department of Defense or the
White House or whoever you have to call,

27:42.663 --> 27:44.706
- whatever you have to do. Just do it.
- It's not up to me.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.874
Do not let her come here.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.211
Not to Houston, not to this building.

27:50.254 --> 27:54.424
If she steps foot on American soil,
she should be arrested, and you know it.

27:54.424 --> 27:57.553
I understand your anger,
but Moscow is insisting

27:57.553 --> 28:01.515
Margo co-chair these working sessions
on engine fabrication,

28:01.515 --> 28:05.227
attachment, slingshot
and earthbound escort.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.438
You know,
they're just doing this to embarrass us.

28:08.438 --> 28:11.108
Probably, but my hands
are tied here, Aleida.

28:11.608 --> 28:14.862
- According to the M-7 charter--
- Oh, fuck the M-7 charter.

28:14.862 --> 28:18.365
How would they like it if we had
Arkady Shevchenko representing Helios?

28:19.241 --> 28:21.577
Might as well
if this is gonna be a big pissing match.

28:23.287 --> 28:25.038
Aleida, I hear you. I do.

28:25.664 --> 28:29.918
But the fact remains she is the head
of their asteroid capture program,

28:30.460 --> 28:33.172
and an incredibly skilled engineer
to boot.

28:33.964 --> 28:38.010
If we're gonna pull this off, we need
the best people from all over the world.

28:40.762 --> 28:41.930
Well, I can't work with her.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.224
- Well, before you start--
- Sir.

28:45.601 --> 28:48.562
There's been an accident at Happy Valley.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.904
Doctor, we have multiple wounded
patients coming in from the explosion.

28:56.904 --> 28:58.405
I need an IV.

28:58.405 --> 29:00.490
Stabilize him.

29:00.490 --> 29:03.869
Burns are full thickness.
Muscles are in contracture.

29:04.620 --> 29:08.290
You! Arterial line kit in that cabinet.
Come on!

29:08.290 --> 29:10.000
Doc! Last one.

29:10.584 --> 29:12.169
Push left over here.

29:12.753 --> 29:15.672
Keep an eye on Jennings.
Vitals are starting to stabilize.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.926
We need to protect her airway.
Get her on O2.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.595
Third degree, but we can debride.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.555
Start an IV.

29:24.097 --> 29:26.225
Need three liters lactated Ringer's.

29:26.225 --> 29:27.726
Cover those wounds in gauze.

29:32.022 --> 29:33.607
Doctor, he's bradying down.

29:34.274 --> 29:35.359
- Jennings?
- Get a line in.

29:35.359 --> 29:37.653
Coming through. Move it. Move it.

29:44.368 --> 29:45.369
Mike.

29:46.286 --> 29:47.871
How many casualties?

29:48.580 --> 29:50.165
We have one fatality so far.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.458
Four more badly injured.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.544
Two in critical condition.

29:53.544 --> 29:56.880
Dima is doing his best to keep them alive,
but it's not looking good.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.340
Oh, goddamn it.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.970
They have dramatically escalated things
up there, Eli.

30:02.970 --> 30:04.680
And we need to respond.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.932
What we need to do is get Poole some help.

30:06.932 --> 30:09.560
I agree.
Things are getting out of control.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.646
Sir, Central Intelligence knows for a fact

30:12.646 --> 30:15.983
that Moscow has at least
one KGB asset in Happy Valley.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.568
Of course they do.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.695
You're not saying they were involved?

30:19.695 --> 30:21.113
No. We don't believe so.

30:21.780 --> 30:24.992
The thing is there are options
at NASA's disposal

30:24.992 --> 30:27.619
to get things under control
that you may not be aware of.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.583
Are you saying
we have assets up there too?

30:32.583 --> 30:35.419
- We do.
- How are we just now hearing about this?

30:36.044 --> 30:40.090
There are 12 North Koreans sitting
a couple hundred feet from Ops-Com.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.717
Can you blame us?

30:41.717 --> 30:44.553
Are there any weapons on the base
I should know about?

30:44.553 --> 30:49.016
Our man has access to standard attenuated
energy projectile systems,

30:49.016 --> 30:52.477
high pressure, nitrogen weapons,
firing non lethal rounds

30:52.477 --> 30:54.897
and they can't pierce
the walls of the habs.

30:54.897 --> 30:57.482
- And skin?
- It doesn't tickle.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.401
Delightful.

31:00.736 --> 31:02.112
So you're suggesting what?

31:02.988 --> 31:06.617
That we have the CIA
and the KGB take control of the base?

31:06.617 --> 31:11.205
We just thought you should know.
In case things did escalate.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.497
Oh, I hear you, Bob.

31:12.497 --> 31:13.999
But I am not gonna be the guy

31:13.999 --> 31:18.337
that authorizes the CIA
to implement martial law on Mars.

31:18.337 --> 31:21.924
We need to reestablish
firm control of this base

31:21.924 --> 31:23.717
and stop these terrorist attacks
from happening.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.552
Terrorism? Really?

31:25.552 --> 31:27.346
Well, what would you call it, Eli?

31:27.346 --> 31:28.722
I mean, it's happened before.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.891
- In fact, it's happened right here.
- Enough.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.351
End of conversation.

31:33.894 --> 31:36.188
We need to find another solution here.

31:38.649 --> 31:42.236
Maybe-- maybe we send up
a security detail like in '83.

31:43.195 --> 31:44.655
Yeah, because that went so well.

31:45.239 --> 31:46.615
They stopped World War III.

31:46.615 --> 31:49.117
Well, you could argue
that it almost caused it.

31:51.995 --> 31:53.664
We don't have enough time anyway.

31:54.623 --> 31:57.167
Between training and travel,
it would take months.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.712
Unless we didn't need to send them up.

32:02.464 --> 32:07.886
We could deputize people on Happy Valley,
people with adequate military training.

32:09.847 --> 32:12.516
Well, how many people are there
like that up there?

32:13.308 --> 32:17.229
Between us and the Soviets,
it must be at least a dozen, if not more.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.024
All right...

32:23.110 --> 32:24.361
let's do that.

32:25.112 --> 32:27.698
This isn't why any of us came up here,

32:27.698 --> 32:31.910
but it's our duty now
to ensure the security of this base

32:32.494 --> 32:33.996
and the safety of this crew.

32:34.663 --> 32:37.624
<i>We need to find those responsible
for this explosion.</i>

32:37.624 --> 32:40.919
<i>So keep your eyes open
for anything suspect.</i>

32:40.919 --> 32:45.549
<i>We have got to make certain that
a tragedy like this never happens again.</i>

32:45.549 --> 32:47.551
Shit, man. Put my stuff down!

32:54.433 --> 32:56.602
Hey. Watch it. That's personal property.

32:56.602 --> 32:58.729
- Hey, stop touching my--
- Back off!

32:58.729 --> 33:01.481
What are-- What the fuck?
Get your hands off him.

33:04.568 --> 33:06.987
Nothing changes. We keep the pressure on.

33:06.987 --> 33:09.031
The pressure? Jennings is dead.

33:09.031 --> 33:10.782
This has gone too far.

33:14.786 --> 33:18.332
Listen up! Listen up!

33:28.634 --> 33:31.678
You guys negotiated with clarity
and with force.

33:33.013 --> 33:34.139
I respect that.

33:36.350 --> 33:37.434
And you stood your ground.

33:39.561 --> 33:43.315
I respect that... even more.

33:44.149 --> 33:48.904
But the truth is
unless we resolve this today, right now,

33:48.904 --> 33:51.615
and get that fuel plant repaired
and pumping liquid argon

33:51.615 --> 33:55.410
so we can capture the most valuable
known object in our solar system,

33:56.036 --> 33:57.287
then we've failed.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.372
All of us.

33:58.372 --> 34:00.666
Okay, so, then give us
what we're asking for.

34:00.666 --> 34:03.585
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Send Goldilocks to Mars.

34:03.585 --> 34:06.672
Look, I wish I could tell you
that were a possibility, but the truth is

34:07.464 --> 34:11.927
the nations of Earth will never,
never send this asteroid to Mars.

34:11.927 --> 34:13.136
You know why?

34:13.846 --> 34:15.973
Because it's not
in their financial interest

34:15.973 --> 34:17.891
and space is a business.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.601
It's about resources.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.520
It's about the bottom line.
It's about profit.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.646
Fuck your profit!

34:22.646 --> 34:25.190
You know, go ahead
and scoff all you want to,

34:25.190 --> 34:27.775
but I mean, that's what this strike
is all about, isn't it?

34:28.735 --> 34:32.572
- You want your cut, your slice of the pie.
- Damn right! I want my cut!

34:33.072 --> 34:36.659
You came here to make a living.

34:37.452 --> 34:42.123
But what you're asking,
changing the destination of this asteroid,

34:42.666 --> 34:46.003
that is never going to happen.

34:46.879 --> 34:48.797
But I'm gonna tell you what can happen.

34:48.797 --> 34:53.217
NASA and Roscosmos have agreed
to your workplace safety concerns.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.971
And as CEO of Helios,

34:55.971 --> 35:00.392
I'm ready to offer you a 40% increase
in your pension contributions...

35:02.227 --> 35:07.774
a more generous health plan
and shares of Helios stock to everybody.

35:07.774 --> 35:11.987
Don't believe a goddamn word
this man says, he's a snake oil salesman.

35:11.987 --> 35:14.031
I'll also make sure
that everybody involved in this strike

35:14.031 --> 35:15.991
gets amnesty for any and all actions

35:15.991 --> 35:18.869
conducted during the negotiations
of the last few days.

35:18.869 --> 35:24.750
And the first 100 people to cross this
line will receive a quadruple payday bonus

35:24.750 --> 35:30.130
which will put you just north of
a million dollars each.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.343
Don't listen to him.

35:35.928 --> 35:37.804
Can't you see what he's trying to do?

35:38.472 --> 35:42.142
He's trying to buy us off
and undercut our solidarity.

35:42.142 --> 35:44.937
We can still win this
if we stick together.

35:44.937 --> 35:46.313
That's right.

35:46.313 --> 35:48.690
Okay, yeah. Sure. You can try to do that.

35:48.690 --> 35:51.818
But you have to ask yourself,
"What's more important?"

35:51.818 --> 35:57.074
Some abstract notion of togetherness,
or is it your families back home?

35:57.741 --> 36:00.827
Is it your kids, your-- your nieces,
your nephews,

36:00.827 --> 36:04.081
your parents, your grandparents,

36:04.790 --> 36:10.003
or is it some rock
that is floating out in space?

36:15.467 --> 36:16.927
Sorry, Sam.

36:16.927 --> 36:18.053
Henry?

36:23.433 --> 36:25.519
I rep 12 at the fuel plant.

36:25.519 --> 36:27.271
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

36:27.271 --> 36:28.480
I've got 88 more.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.065
Come on!

36:31.108 --> 36:33.610
- Hey, hey. Don't do this. Don't do this.
- What are you doing?

36:36.071 --> 36:38.907
Cowards. Quitters.

36:40.909 --> 36:42.286
Must stand strong.

36:46.707 --> 36:47.875
Y'all make me sick.

36:53.797 --> 36:54.798
Ilya?

36:57.176 --> 36:58.510
Maya?

36:59.553 --> 37:01.930
Immunity, Skip. Sorry.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.900
I rep all 18 in fab, weld and finish.

37:24.077 --> 37:26.205
Luka. Luka!

37:36.590 --> 37:37.799
Well done, Dev.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.719
You just killed Mars.

37:47.518 --> 37:50.479
<i>... and former director
of NASA, Margo Madison,</i>

37:50.479 --> 37:52.648
<i>has returned to the United States</i>

37:52.648 --> 37:56.109
<i>nearly a decade
after defecting to the Soviet Union.</i>

37:56.109 --> 38:00.239
<i>Her arrival in Houston today
was met with massive protests.</i>

38:00.239 --> 38:05.827
<i>Many calling for her arrest though Madison
is protected by a diplomatic immunity</i>

38:05.827 --> 38:09.373
<i>while she is here in her role
as the head of Roscosmos as--</i>

38:53.166 --> 38:55.961
Margo Madison, I'm Eli Hobson.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.380
Welcome to the Molly Cobb Space Center.

38:59.298 --> 39:00.465
Thank you.

39:01.758 --> 39:02.759
Shall we?

39:45.219 --> 39:46.303
Admiral.

39:46.303 --> 39:47.513
What the hell?

39:50.015 --> 39:52.893
You got some nerve
coming in here after what you just did.

39:52.893 --> 39:57.481
Admittedly so, but I need your help.

39:57.481 --> 39:59.233
Why the fuck would I help you?

39:59.233 --> 40:02.236
Because we both want the same thing--
To never go back.

40:02.236 --> 40:04.446
You don't know...

40:04.446 --> 40:07.407
You're still here, aren't you?
After all these years?

40:08.283 --> 40:10.369
You and I both know
that Mars has the potential

40:10.369 --> 40:13.330
to become a living, breathing society.

40:13.330 --> 40:16.083
Something that lasts
well beyond the two of us...

40:17.459 --> 40:18.669
and we can make that happen.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.630
You just ruined any chance of that.

40:21.630 --> 40:23.465
I know that was painful.

40:23.465 --> 40:24.883
Believe me. I know.

40:24.883 --> 40:29.555
To see how driven they all were
by self-interest, by greed.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.140
It would be funny
if it wasn't so predictable.

40:33.183 --> 40:36.228
But the strike,
for all its inconveniences,

40:36.228 --> 40:39.940
it wound up being a blessing,
because a few of you,

40:39.940 --> 40:42.442
you showed just how much
you believe in your cause,

40:43.402 --> 40:47.281
how much that you would sacrifice
for something greater than yourselves.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.827
And we're gonna need
as much of that as we can get.

40:51.827 --> 40:53.871
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:53.871 --> 40:59.877
I'm talking about the future, Ed.
About taking what is rightfully ours.

41:11.221 --> 41:12.764
You can't be serious.

41:14.141 --> 41:16.518
Do you want to help me steal an asteroid?
