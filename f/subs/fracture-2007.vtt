02:47.876 --> 02:51.128
The NTSB guys are here
about that bulkhead problem.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.548
Okay, thanks.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.935
It's there.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.773
I should run the algorithms, though?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.442
Nope.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.236
You wanna wait for those
spectrometer results?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.613
No.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.892
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.064
What about dinner tonight?

04:34.858 --> 04:38.319
We go out to dinner,
we might never come back.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.237
Okay.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.701
I wanna wake up with you...

04:46.328 --> 04:47.703
...Mrs. Smith.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.292
I want to at least see where you live.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.298
I live here...

05:00.342 --> 05:01.968
...Mr. Smith.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.169
- Metro Division.
- Uh, Lieutenant Nunally, please.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.256
Lieutenant Nunally comes on
at 6:00 tonight.

05:40.424 --> 05:45.011
-Can someone else help you?
-That's okay, I'll see him later. Thank you.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.623
Hey.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.227
- Afternoon, Ciro.
- Hello, seÃ±ora.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.636
Hello there.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.474
You're home early.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.768
Yeah.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.733
I just felt...

08:45.901 --> 08:47.943
...a sudden urge.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.987
Are you okay?

08:52.574 --> 08:55.492
Yeah. I could use a hug.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.832
You know, I've been
watching you sleep...

09:02.500 --> 09:04.126
...at night.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.341
-That's creepy.
-Yeah.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.885
Sometimes at work,
I'll start thinking about you...

09:13.053 --> 09:14.929
...and I'll just get....

09:15.931 --> 09:17.765
-Just overwhelmed.
-Ted.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.642
It's a dense, crushing...

09:19.809 --> 09:22.728
...geophysical force,
like I'm pinned at the core.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.856
While things change, you know?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.860
Do you ever get
that way about me, Jen?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.571
I don't think I can
do one of these tonight.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.532
I'm just trying
to describe my feelings.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.243
Those don't sound like feelings.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.119
Oh.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.206
What's the sound of a feeling?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.336
You think you're so much
smarter than me.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.505
It must make you feel very powerful.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.091
Helpless, actually.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.636
-Okay, maybe it's time to really talk.
-No.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.013
-No?
-No.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.808
Fine, whatever.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.978
I'll go change. I'll make some dinner.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.193
I love you.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.822
I know.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.618
Does he...

10:20.287 --> 10:22.329
...Mrs. Smith?

10:26.001 --> 10:28.919
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.464
Knowledge is pain. I'm used to that.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.384
Not that I don't get
some little pleasures...

10:35.552 --> 10:37.344
...in return for the pain, mind you.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.342
Mr. and Mrs. Crawford?
You all right?

11:19.054 --> 11:21.096
Is everybody okay in there?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.763
- Notice anything out of the ordinary?
- I didn't see anything unusual.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.182
-Just Mr. and Mrs. Crawford.
-Nobody else?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.226
No. No.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.021
Flores, how you been?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.898
Good, good. You know, same.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.151
We got one witness, maybe.
The gardener.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.610
His name's Ciro.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.737
Hey, guys, this is Lieutenant Nunally.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.656
- Good to meet you.
- Hello, sir.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.991
So, what do we know?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.502
Mr. Crawford?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.213
-Who is this?
-My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.341
I'm a hostage negotiator
with the L.A.P.D.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.802
Mr. Crawford?

13:30.268 --> 13:31.768
Okay.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.481
You two, let's go.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.785
Just you, please.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.259
Mr. Crawford?

14:05.053 --> 14:08.138
I'm just gonna slide the door open
just a bit, all right?

14:12.810 --> 14:15.062
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.106
Do I call you Rob?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.276
Sure, yeah. If you want to.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.821
Lots of vampires out there.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.452
Mr. Crawford, what do you say
you give me the gun?

14:30.620 --> 14:34.248
That way I can pay more attention
to what you're saying. All right?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.627
Is that your best shot, Rob?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.879
So to speak.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.758
Tell you what. I will if you will.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.553
We both put down our guns.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.265
We set them down and we step away.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.768
Then you can pay attention
to what I'm saying.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.273
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to put yours down first, then.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.692
Then you have my word.
Everybody gives a little...

15:01.859 --> 15:04.653
...we'll see what we can do
about getting you what you want.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.405
Happy ending, then.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.295
Mr. Crawford,
your gardener tells it...

15:21.462 --> 15:23.297
-...that your wife--
-It's Ted.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.467
-I'm sorry?
-You can call me Ted.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.762
Ted. Great. Ted.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.099
Your wife, is she here?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.732
Is she all right?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.736
I don't think she is. I shot her.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.405
You shot your wife?

15:48.573 --> 15:51.450
It's just like I suddenly snapped...

15:52.285 --> 15:55.662
...and I got the gun
and I shot her in the head.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.165
I know it was wrong.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.841
Are you listening to me, Rob?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.179
Oh, Jesus Christ.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.892
I read somewhere that the best place
to find a pulse is in the femoral artery.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.561
It's on the inner surface
of the upper thigh.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.397
So if you just
put your fingers up her skirt...

16:22.607 --> 16:24.191
...you'll find it.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.826
- Break it up!
- We got a victim down!

16:35.078 --> 16:36.078
All right.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.543
She's got a pulse.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.808
Rob. Good job.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.935
You all right?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.112
I wanna be in the room.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.406
Well, we got it covered.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.325
Yeah, I know.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.870
I just wanna be there.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.583
And I want this thing locked...

18:04.751 --> 18:07.461
...before we pass it to the DA.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.476
Stop yelling, Phil.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.563
I called you as a courtesy
and now you're trying to take advantage.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.483
I'm not. I'm not knocking it down
to a class C.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.069
My backlog of open cases
doesn't mitigate the fact...

19:14.237 --> 19:17.280
...that your client tried
to kill his brother-in-law.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.076
A golfing accident. Phil...

19:21.244 --> 19:23.870
...your client owns one golf club,
no golf balls...

19:24.038 --> 19:26.790
...and the accident happened
in a stairwell...

19:26.958 --> 19:31.086
...of an after-hours,
illegal gambling hall.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.464
I'll see you in court.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.009
Well, I won't,
but someone from this office will.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.303
You can take it up with them.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.975
Los Angeles district attorney's office.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.853
- Beachum.
- Yes, it is.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.062
Hello.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.400
No, I didn't.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.278
-Yeah.
-Wooton Sims?

19:56.487 --> 19:57.529
Shh.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.739
- Wooton Sims?
- Shut up.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.616
Short notice is fine.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.618
It's fine. Uh-huh.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.704
Black tie? Fine.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.248
What time? That'll be fine.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.918
Thank her for me. All right.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.464
- How many times did I just say "fine"?
- You asshole.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.800
How the hell did you get
a job at Wooton Sims?

20:18.968 --> 20:22.304
I can't even get an interview.
I've been here five years, Willy.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.931
I'm your supervisor.
I graduated USC, summa.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.142
-I need a tuxedo.
-A tux?

20:27.310 --> 20:30.270
-You are full of shit.
-I need it for tonight. Is that possible?

20:30.438 --> 20:31.771
- Of course.
- They do that?

20:31.939 --> 20:33.481
- Same day sort of thing?
- Uh-huh. Sure.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.941
- Can I give you that?
- Yeah.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.818
-Okay.
-Well, that's maxed out...

20:36.986 --> 20:38.528
...so I'm gonna give you this.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.488
So, what's this all about?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.450
You know, Burt Wooton's
having a charity-opera thing and....

20:43.618 --> 20:45.952
-Burt?
-Well, that's what he told me to call him.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.496
You're gonna need
to pick out a style, Willy.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.290
- Like what?
- Willy Beachum's office.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.500
- I'm thinking maybe classic.
- Classic.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.085
- Yeah, no problem.
- Classic.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.880
Just makes sure it comes with
cuff links and kneepads.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.049
- Willy.
- Oh. That's not classic.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.051
-That's what I'm saying.
-Before, after.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.887
- That's the way I go.
- God wants to see you.

21:05.681 --> 21:09.142
-Our God?
-Who art on the fourth floor.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.814
Mr. Lobruto? Mr. Beachum.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.236
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.450
William "No Middle Initial" Beachum.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.704
Wow, a 97 percent conviction rate.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.124
-That's impressive.
-Thank you, sir.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.836
Of course, you traded all
your losing cases to other DDAs.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.422
Well...

21:40.466 --> 21:43.510
...I took on two or three cases
for every one I gave away.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.679
They just couldn't
handle their caseloads...

21:45.846 --> 21:47.305
...and I don't like to lose.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.933
You won't always win
working at Wooton Sims.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.645
Working at Wooton Sims
sort of is winning.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.980
Isn't it?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.774
Well, you'll need a middle initial.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.819
-Sir?
-Well, those guys all play squash...

22:00.987 --> 22:02.779
...and have middle names.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.365
They go in for their mother's
maiden name a lot.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.410
Well, my mother
doesn't have a maiden name.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.454
I think you belong here, William.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.624
With all due respect, sir...

22:14.792 --> 22:17.836
...I just didn't work this hard
to stay where I belong.

22:18.421 --> 22:22.215
Yeah, well, I didn't think so.

22:24.427 --> 22:27.012
Well, you have your
litigation experience...

22:27.179 --> 22:28.304
...your chops...

22:29.640 --> 22:32.350
...and your juicy private-sector job.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.103
Pretty soon you'll be courtside
at Laker games.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.731
Anything else the city
of Los Angeles can do for you?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.567
No, sir. I think that'll be all.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.194
It's a cummerbund, Willy.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.156
That's gonna go
around your waist, okay?

22:46.323 --> 22:48.241
-Okay. Are we good?
-Uh-huh.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.285
-Good. Good.
-All right.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.959
Willy?

22:58.127 --> 23:00.420
Willy, come on. Pick up the phone.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.381
What, Norman?

23:03.549 --> 23:04.758
Got an attempted homicide.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.801
Guy shot his wife, she's in a coma.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.555
Arraignment's at 3:00
with Judge Moran.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.182
Three o'clock is in 15 minutes.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.226
You do still actually work here--

23:15.394 --> 23:17.353
Would you just find
somebody else to do it?

23:17.521 --> 23:19.647
Everybody's booked.
It's not going to trial.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.483
There's a weapon with prints...

23:21.650 --> 23:22.901
...and a signed confession.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.029
Just take the arraignment,
wait for the plea.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.907
It's a real confession?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.534
Spontaneous and signed.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.244
Come on, Willy.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.789
All right...

23:36.624 --> 23:38.583
...but here's the problem.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.293
That'll do! I've given my ruling.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.712
If they wanna squabble,
they can take it outside.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.091
I apologize, Your Honor.
Your Honor, please. Your Honor.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.103
Mr. Beachum.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.688
Nice to see a man
who dresses for court.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.774
I'm very sorry, Your Honor.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.692
I'm very sorry.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.236
It's a long story.

24:06.403 --> 24:10.615
The people of the State
of California v. Theodore Crawford.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.911
The public defender
is representing Mr. Crawford...

24:15.079 --> 24:18.289
...for his arraignment, with the
understanding that he will secure...

24:18.457 --> 24:20.416
...private counsel
for further proceedings.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.669
Mr. Crawford,
you have been charged...

24:22.837 --> 24:25.588
...with Section 664 slash 187...

24:25.756 --> 24:28.967
...of the California penal code,
attempted murder.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.219
Do you waive further
reading of the complaint...

24:31.387 --> 24:33.596
- ...and complete statement of rights?
- You do.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.973
I do. But l--

24:35.141 --> 24:37.225
And do you wish to enter
a plea at this time?

24:37.393 --> 24:41.521
Yes, not guilty. But I also want to waive
my right to counsel and represent myself.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.483
Surely you won't have trouble
finding an attorney, Mr. Crawford?

24:45.651 --> 24:48.987
-No, but I want to do it.
-If I can have a moment with my client....

24:49.155 --> 24:51.281
I'm not your client.
Try and keep up, will you?

24:51.448 --> 24:52.782
Mr. Crawford...

24:52.950 --> 24:55.160
...you're facing some
very serious charges here.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.745
I strongly urge you to retain counsel.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.540
That's very kind,
but I believe I'm within my rights.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.002
Be aware that lack of counsel
will not be grounds for an appeal.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.129
Oh, I understand. I understand.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.590
The People have an objection,
Mr. Beachum?

25:11.218 --> 25:13.636
Well, Your Honor, we have...

25:13.804 --> 25:16.639
...a verbal and signed confession.

25:17.474 --> 25:22.187
So I would strongly advise
Mr. Crawford to....

25:25.024 --> 25:27.859
To get a competent attorney
to try and negotiate a plea.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.612
That's pretty damning evidence.
You wanna reconsider?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.071
Absolutely not.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.781
It's gonna turn into a circus.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.743
I appreciate your concern
for the dignity of the court, 007.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.996
Unfortunately, the man
is a tax-paying citizen...

25:40.164 --> 25:43.583
...and entitled by our Constitution
to try and manipulate the system...

25:43.751 --> 25:47.962
-...like everybody else.
-If Mr. Crawford wants to go pro per...

25:48.714 --> 25:50.632
...that's gonna take a while,
and sadly...

25:50.799 --> 25:54.761
...I won't be here for it.
But the People have no objection.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.971
Your Honor, I'd like to...

25:57.139 --> 25:59.098
...waive my right
to preliminary hearing...

25:59.266 --> 26:01.351
...and go direct to trial
as soon as possible.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.269
Does that help you, Mr. Beachum?

26:03.437 --> 26:05.563
You don't have to worry
about Mr. Beachum.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.816
The district attorney's office
will assign another prosecutor.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.109
No, I like Mr. Beachum.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.197
Mr. Beachum...

26:14.907 --> 26:16.491
...he likes you.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.788
Yes. That's terrific.

26:22.331 --> 26:26.167
It appears Crawford has an understanding
of his rights and responsibilities...

26:26.335 --> 26:28.378
...so it's your call, Mr. Beachum.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.513
Why not?

26:39.223 --> 26:42.767
All right, then. Case will move to trial
at the first available date.

26:52.653 --> 26:53.903
Beachum.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.367
You're supposed to be good.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.497
Is that right?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.001
Who the hell are you?

27:08.168 --> 27:12.755
I'm Lieutenant Nunally.
I took Crawford's confession.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.383
Oh.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.472
Okay. So, what can I do for you?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.768
Are you gonna be on this, or what?

27:27.021 --> 27:30.606
Because it looks to me like you got
one foot out the door already.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.986
Oh.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.240
You should be taking this seriously.

27:39.408 --> 27:43.578
You know, be careful with this guy, he's--
There's something not right about him.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.122
You took the confession, right?

27:47.541 --> 27:50.084
-You took the gun out of his hand.
-Yeah.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.545
Good. So it's done.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.839
Don't worry about it.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.152
-Can I have a bourbon?
-Yes, sir.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.528
Thank you.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.700
Are you a shark?

28:24.828 --> 28:27.288
-Excuse me?
-You've been circling this lobby...

28:27.456 --> 28:28.956
...for half an hour now.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.709
Like if you stopped, you'd die.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.087
Yeah, I'm a shark.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.882
What about you? Are you a shark too?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.259
Did you say hi to Burt?

28:41.261 --> 28:42.428
Oh.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.723
Burt's talking to the mayor.
Do I know you?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.725
Nikki Gardner.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.103
Your new boss.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.271
Oh.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.524
You're the one who sent
the invitation?

28:54.691 --> 28:57.402
Well, I thought I ought to
get to know the mystery man...

28:57.569 --> 29:00.279
...that Burt plucked out of nowhere.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.326
Well, I don't really know Burt.

29:13.001 --> 29:17.088
So every partner has a team
of senior associates.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.466
Every senior associate
has a team of junior associates.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.760
And you're on my team, which means...

29:22.928 --> 29:27.056
...I'll supervise your casework and I'll
steer you through the office politics.

29:27.975 --> 29:31.519
-Kind of like a mentor.
-Kind of like a probation officer.

29:32.813 --> 29:35.356
Oh, you're trying to scare me.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.151
Let me ask you a question.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.987
Okay. Shoot.

29:41.697 --> 29:45.366
We have a senior associate
at the firm named Calvin Tyler.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.160
Kind of a rising star.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.288
He goes into court against you,
some client's kid is DUI...

29:50.456 --> 29:52.582
...and the next thing we know,
Calvin is fired.

29:52.749 --> 29:56.252
And Burt Wooton, who has never even
interviewed a junior associate before...

29:56.420 --> 30:00.673
...let alone hired one,
says you're starting in two weeks.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.052
Calvin came to me for a deal.

30:05.512 --> 30:09.432
So I told him if he can get me
a meeting with Mr. Wooton...

30:10.934 --> 30:12.268
...that I'd throw the case.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.813
He set it up, but he came
to court unprepared...

30:15.981 --> 30:18.357
...and I mopped the floor with him.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.902
Your client got the maximum,
and then, next day...

30:21.069 --> 30:23.237
...I was meeting with Mr. Wooton.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.323
Burt.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.535
That's--

30:30.287 --> 30:32.830
You didn't actually do
anything all that wrong.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.957
I wasn't exactly honest with Calvin.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.423
Are you gonna get that?

30:45.928 --> 30:48.554
Everybody I wanna talk to is right here.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.936
Welcome to Wooton Sims.
Get your phone.

30:58.148 --> 31:01.984
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's Flores. I got bad news.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.153
The gun. It's no good.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.531
What do you mean, the gun's no good?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.407
Well, it's a fine gun.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.576
It's just no good as evidence.

31:10.744 --> 31:13.371
-It's never been fired.
-Never been fired?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.831
Well, it's the gun
from the house, isn't it?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.416
Yeah. It's...

31:17.584 --> 31:22.797
...the property of the defendant.
Bought about one month ago.

31:22.965 --> 31:25.216
Well, the guy never left the house.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.635
He was locked inside
from the time of the crime...

31:27.803 --> 31:30.096
...to the time of the arrest.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.640
So the gun is in there.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.351
So don't tell me
that the gun isn't in there.

31:35.519 --> 31:39.105
Go find it. Get a team out there
tomorrow and find it.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.794
No, I haven't. I have not.

32:43.962 --> 32:48.633
Well, everything's been so expedited, you
know. And I guess I just thought that....

32:48.800 --> 32:51.218
I don't know. I thought
however it was decorated...

32:51.386 --> 32:52.803
...was how it was decorated.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.639
Huh?

32:54.890 --> 32:56.390
- Right away, sir.
- Well...

32:56.558 --> 32:59.644
...what do most of the other
junior associates have?

33:01.104 --> 33:02.438
Oh.

33:02.773 --> 33:03.856
Well, what--

33:04.024 --> 33:05.983
What is the difference between...

33:06.151 --> 33:08.444
...Italian and English?

33:11.323 --> 33:13.407
I know that they're
two different countries.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.285
I was talking about in terms
of interior design.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.621
Can you hold on one second?

33:19.956 --> 33:23.042
What kind of style
would you say that this is?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.627
Homicidal modern?

33:28.548 --> 33:31.717
I don't know. I guess I'll just
know it when I see it.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.719
Uh-huh.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.516
Ooh. Two o'clock? I don't--

33:40.769 --> 33:42.895
Yeah, all right. I can do it.
Bye-bye, now.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.980
All right, good to see you.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.609
-What the hell is this?
-It's a...

33:48.777 --> 33:50.861
...thing. It does stuff.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.490
-What, did he make it or something?
-The guy? Yeah.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.160
Here, take a look at this.
It's for the Glock 45...

33:58.328 --> 33:59.370
...found at the scene.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.624
Now, we got no other
sign of a gun so far.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.919
No weapon. No powder on his hand...

34:07.087 --> 34:09.630
...no blood on his clothes.
We found four shell casings.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.549
Forty-five's wiped clean. No prints.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.342
That's four shots fired.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.511
Four bullets missing from the case.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.472
Four shell casings on the floor
with no prints on them.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.975
And a gun that's never been fired.

34:21.685 --> 34:25.020
The guy's screwing with us.
He's stacking the deck.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.692
She's pretty.

34:30.902 --> 34:35.697
Look, the gun is in this house.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.824
Maybe he was wearing gloves.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.286
Maybe he had time to change.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.913
But it's in the house,
and I'll tell you why.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.081
Because people
were watching the house...

34:45.250 --> 34:46.667
...and he never came out.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.210
I could be wrong,
but I don't think that the gun...

34:49.379 --> 34:52.590
...grew little gun legs
and ran out of the house.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.301
So if you need more guys...

34:55.469 --> 34:57.261
...I'm all for it.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.027
- That's disability insurance.
- Uh-huh.

35:13.487 --> 35:16.822
Most of our employees get that.
It's only an additional $6.84 a month.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.240
-All right.
-Just be sure...

35:18.408 --> 35:22.244
...you sign the one with the devil
in blood. It's not binding otherwise.

35:22.704 --> 35:24.705
I'm going to a meeting.
Wanted to stop by...

35:24.873 --> 35:27.374
...and make sure you're getting
everything you need.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.085
I'm getting more than I need.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.382
I'm running a little late.
Will you walk with me?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.510
- Yeah.
- I'll send him right back.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.346
No problem. We were
just finishing paperwork and ordering.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.557
- Gonna give him swatches and chips.
- Which I thought was to eat...

35:43.725 --> 35:45.893
-...didn't l?
-Yeah, you did.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.394
All right.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.688
- I like that.
- Oh, I like that one too.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.650
-No purple.
-Let me handle it.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.693
"More than I need," huh?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.863
Oh, I was just talking
about the furniture.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.157
Don't get too attached.
You won't be here much.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.953
Two weeks from Tuesday, whole team's
getting on a plane to Chicago.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.790
-Why, what's going on in Chicago?
-Garfield.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.626
Garfield? Ain't that
the bio tech guy who stole...

36:10.794 --> 36:12.920
...like, 300 million
from his own company?

36:13.088 --> 36:18.050
That bio tech guy who had no idea
whatsoever what his CFO was doing.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.302
Oh, right.

36:20.637 --> 36:23.055
This is a test, Willy.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.933
Burt told me to give you a trial by fire.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.853
I'm good at trials by fire.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.690
He wants you up to speed on eight
months of depositions in two weeks.

36:32.858 --> 36:36.777
-No problem.
-What about closing out your old job?

36:36.945 --> 36:38.821
Don't worry about it.

36:51.293 --> 36:52.877
Willy?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.548
- Yeah?
- Beachum.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.426
No, Danny, no.
No, no, no. I-- No.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.595
The idea is to get things out of here.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.847
Oh, is that the idea?

37:05.015 --> 37:07.016
I'm really sorry.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.520
-Enjoy a jellybean.
-Thanks.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.315
-What color did you get?
-Yellow.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.859
Oh, that's popcorn. That's gross.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.278
-Well, thanks.
-Told you.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.114
Danny, this isn't e--

38:27.263 --> 38:29.056
All right.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.186
Sorry.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.274
How's my wife?

38:39.985 --> 38:41.652
Uh, I don't know.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.822
I'm sure she's been better, though.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.618
I heard somewhere, I think on NPR, that
you're supposed to talk to people in a coma.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.205
Play their favorite music. It may
help them or get through to them.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.833
-Uh-huh.
-But you're probably too busy...

38:56.001 --> 38:59.169
...getting up to speed
on the Garfield case, I suppose.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.219
-Excuse me?
-HM?

39:08.179 --> 39:10.139
Oh, no, I'm not--

39:10.306 --> 39:12.141
I'm not judging you, Willy. No.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.143
Anyone coming
from what you came from...

39:14.310 --> 39:17.229
...then paying your way through
East Nookie Cows hit College...

39:17.397 --> 39:20.190
...by writing papers
for Princeton kids on the internet--

39:20.358 --> 39:22.651
My God, $60,000 in debt...

39:22.819 --> 39:26.488
...and a 97 percent conviction rate, wow.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.449
You deserve it, kiddo.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.244
What have you been doing?

39:32.412 --> 39:34.621
I'm permitted the use
of a private investigator.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.833
-Not to investigate me.
-Why not? You're investigating me.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.378
-Because you shot your wife.
-Allegedly.

39:41.546 --> 39:42.963
That's how it works, right?

39:43.131 --> 39:46.759
If I can't introduce something in court
as evidence, it doesn't exist legally.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.845
I'm not gonna play games with you.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.140
I'm afraid you have to, old sport.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.772
What is this? What is it,
some kind of form of communication?

39:59.939 --> 40:01.565
Uh-huh. You sent me a box of papers.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.817
It's called disc--

40:04.402 --> 40:06.570
It's called discovery, all right?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.947
That's where the state
is legally obligated...

40:09.115 --> 40:12.117
...to provide all the evidence
to the defendant...

40:12.285 --> 40:15.579
-...so you can prepare your defense.
-There's nothing in it, Willy.

40:15.747 --> 40:18.123
You haven't actually discovered anything.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.585
That's one point of view.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.630
Another might be that
I've hit the mother lode.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.341
Oh, have they found the gun?

40:27.509 --> 40:30.177
I don't need the gun to convict you.

40:30.512 --> 40:31.887
Ah.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.098
Tell me something.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.725
Does it bother you that I call you Willy?

40:37.769 --> 40:41.188
No.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.357
Willy.

40:46.319 --> 40:49.238
Willy, I'd like you to consider
becoming my lawyer.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.742
I'll pay you lots of money.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.578
I'm prosecuting you.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.623
Yes, but I'm giving you a chance
to get on the other side...

40:59.791 --> 41:01.834
...of this unholy mess
while you still can.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.752
Right.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.171
Are you out of your mind?

41:06.339 --> 41:09.925
I think, on advice of counsel,
I'll decline to answer that one.

41:10.093 --> 41:12.136
All right. Well, look, I'm gonna--

41:12.303 --> 41:15.222
Thank you for your offer.
I'm gonna stay right where I am.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.766
At least for one more week.

41:20.728 --> 41:24.064
Look, just keep this. Don't send it back.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.484
You need that. You also need to
come up with a witness list.

41:27.652 --> 41:30.863
No, I'll leave all
that witness crap to you.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.907
Right. Because you're not gonna
call any witnesses.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.286
No, I'm innocent, remember,
until proven guilty.

41:38.121 --> 41:41.498
Whatever. You heard the judge.
You know that's not grounds for an appeal.

41:41.666 --> 41:45.335
What the heck? Jury of my peers,
and so on and so forth.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.545
Right.

41:49.549 --> 41:52.092
You know, my grandfather
was an egg farmer.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.264
This isn't gonna be about
your rough childhood, is it?

41:57.432 --> 42:00.058
No, I used to candle eggs at his farm.
Know what that is?

42:00.226 --> 42:02.352
You hold an egg up to
the light of a candle...

42:02.520 --> 42:05.147
...and you look for imperfections.
First time I did it...

42:05.315 --> 42:07.608
...he told me to put
the cracked or flawed eggs...

42:07.775 --> 42:09.776
...into a bucket for the bakery.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.486
And he came back an hour later...

42:11.654 --> 42:13.864
...and there were 300 eggs
in the bakery bucket.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.407
He asked me what I was doing.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.993
I found a flaw
in every single one of them.

42:18.161 --> 42:21.371
You know, thin places in the shell...

42:21.539 --> 42:24.082
...and fine hairline cracks.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.254
You look closely enough,
you'll find everything has a weak spot...

42:29.422 --> 42:32.758
...where it can break, sooner or later.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.596
You looking for mine?

42:38.097 --> 42:39.598
I've already found yours.

42:40.475 --> 42:41.558
What is it?

42:43.645 --> 42:45.979
You're a winner, Willy.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.445
Yeah. Well, I guess the joke's on me,
then, isn't it?

42:54.197 --> 42:56.990
You bet your ass, old sport.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.819
- What time was that?
- About 5:00.

43:33.987 --> 43:35.570
Then she went into the house.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.198
Prior to that, had you seen
Mr. Crawford arrive?

43:39.033 --> 43:41.743
-Yes.
-When was that?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.745
Earlier than usual.

43:43.913 --> 43:46.331
Maybe 4:00.

43:48.001 --> 43:50.043
Did Mr. Crawford park in the carport?

43:50.211 --> 43:52.713
No, he always parks in the garage.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.549
He's very careful with his car.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.677
Would you say that Mr. Crawford
was a very careful man?

43:58.845 --> 44:00.262
Oh, yes.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.347
Always.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.018
Thank you.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.147
No further questions, Your Honor.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.777
Mr. Crawford.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.030
Yes, Your Honor?

44:22.076 --> 44:25.287
Uh.... Hello, Ciro.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.543
No, Mr. Crawford.

44:31.711 --> 44:34.796
It's your turn
to cross-examine this witness.

44:34.964 --> 44:38.425
Oh, no. No questions.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.848
- What time?
- Five-twelve exactly.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.810
We called in SWAT as soon as we knew
there was a possible hostage situation.

44:48.978 --> 44:52.189
Then I tried to establish contact
through the front gate intercom.

44:52.357 --> 44:53.899
Any answer?

44:54.067 --> 44:55.359
- None.
- What then?

44:55.526 --> 44:57.152
Two other uniformed squads arrived.

44:57.320 --> 45:01.198
We established a perimeter
outside the walls as quickly as possible...

45:01.741 --> 45:03.867
...to keep the house under observation.

45:05.870 --> 45:08.413
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, Mr. Beachum.

45:08.581 --> 45:10.332
Your Honor.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.504
So the house was
completely surrounded...

45:15.671 --> 45:18.715
-...within minutes of your arrival.
-All four sides.

45:18.883 --> 45:21.301
And neither you nor any other officer...

45:21.469 --> 45:25.097
...saw anyone go into
or come out of that house?

45:25.264 --> 45:27.391
- No.
- And what happened next?

45:27.558 --> 45:30.936
The bullet pierced through the
frontal cortex and the temporal lobe...

45:31.104 --> 45:34.856
...coming to rest on the upper right side
of her brain, against the skull.

45:35.024 --> 45:39.319
-And degree of injury?
-It inflicted grievous and irreparable injury.

45:39.821 --> 45:41.863
Dr. Kang, is it safe to say...

45:42.031 --> 45:46.201
...that someone who inflicted
this kind of wound intended to kill?

45:46.369 --> 45:47.452
Oh, a moment.

45:48.913 --> 45:51.581
-Mr. Crawford?
-Yes, Your Honor?

45:51.749 --> 45:53.125
You might want to object.

45:53.292 --> 45:56.211
The witness can't know
your state of mind.

45:56.796 --> 45:59.256
No, thank you, Your Honor.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.884
Proceed.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.722
Sorry.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.850
And after you put down your gun...

46:10.017 --> 46:11.726
...what did Mr. Crawford do?

46:11.894 --> 46:13.937
He confessed to shooting his wife.

46:14.856 --> 46:16.690
He confessed.

46:18.025 --> 46:21.069
Now, did Mr. Crawford
appear confused...

46:21.237 --> 46:24.072
...intoxicated or impaired in any way?

46:24.240 --> 46:27.951
No. No, not at all.
He knew exactly what was going on.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.953
Detective Nunally...

46:30.121 --> 46:35.250
...what did Mr. Crawford say?

46:35.418 --> 46:39.671
He said, "It was like
I just suddenly snapped.

46:39.839 --> 46:42.632
I got the gun and I shot my wife.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.260
-I shot her in the head."
-Objection.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.263
I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,
did you say something?

46:48.431 --> 46:50.765
Yes, I wish to object.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.810
- On what grounds?
- I don't know.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.438
-Your Honor--
TED: Um....

46:56.606 --> 46:59.816
I don't know what you'd call it, but--

46:59.984 --> 47:02.360
It wasn't the first
time it happened either...

47:02.528 --> 47:04.279
...but I....

47:04.447 --> 47:08.909
I don't know the legal terminology.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.786
Well, why don't you try
and explain it in layman's terms?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.581
Um....

47:15.082 --> 47:16.583
Fucking the victim.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.466
You said layman's terms.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.259
-Your Honor--
TED: I'm sorry...

47:26.427 --> 47:30.138
...but what would you call it, legally,
when the officer who arrested you...

47:30.306 --> 47:34.100
...was having sexual intercourse with
your wife? I think it's objectionable.

47:34.268 --> 47:37.729
It's rather disgusting is what I think.
But I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

47:41.025 --> 47:42.692
Tsk.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.612
Rob?

47:49.033 --> 47:50.492
Oh, shit.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.459
Can I talk to you for a second?

48:02.380 --> 48:03.838
No!

48:04.131 --> 48:06.633
Order. Order. Just-- Bailiffs. Order!

48:06.801 --> 48:09.427
Order! Bailiffs! Please.

48:09.595 --> 48:13.014
- You lying son of a bitch.
- Please. We're in recess.

48:23.526 --> 48:26.695
He had my witness list
and he should've filed to suppress.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.739
-My mistake, I'm sorry.
-Mr. Crawford, you were warned.

48:29.907 --> 48:33.493
-You don't get to use that as an excuse.
-What about the fact that it's true?

48:33.661 --> 48:36.329
I mean, isn't that the point here,
to get to the truth?

48:36.497 --> 48:38.415
Mr. Beachum, is it true?

48:39.417 --> 48:42.711
I have no idea, Your Honor.
I just heard about it five minutes ago.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.755
Put him back on the witness stand,
if you don't believe me.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.465
This is getting out of hand.

48:47.633 --> 48:51.011
Now, he just provoked my witness
with an outrageous allegation.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.804
My dick has evidence.

48:52.972 --> 48:55.056
-Excuse me?
-My dick, my private investigator.

48:55.224 --> 48:58.226
I call him dick. Perhaps I should call him
as a rebuttal witness.

48:58.394 --> 49:02.230
Because since the tragedy, he's dug up
hotel records and witnesses...

49:02.398 --> 49:05.567
...that confirm that my wife
and Mr. Nunally were having an affair.

49:05.735 --> 49:09.321
-My dick is good.
-Your Honor, so, what if he was?

49:09.488 --> 49:11.281
- Mr. Beachum.
- Even if he was--

49:11.449 --> 49:13.450
Your witness was intimate
with the victim...

49:13.618 --> 49:16.703
...and assaulted the defendant
during the arrest.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.998
Actually, while trying to obtain
my so-called confession.

49:20.166 --> 49:23.209
-Yes.
-Oh, come on.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.211
Is that a legal argument,
"Oh, come on"?

49:26.005 --> 49:28.465
Don't make me come across this table
because I will--

49:28.633 --> 49:30.842
He dictated
and signed his confession...

49:31.010 --> 49:33.428
...at the station
long after the incident, all right?

49:33.596 --> 49:35.722
In fear for my life,
since my wife's lover...

49:35.890 --> 49:39.768
...who had just beaten me,
was in the room with his friends...

49:39.935 --> 49:41.227
...and the other officers.

49:41.395 --> 49:44.773
Was Detective Nunally present
during Mr. Crawford's interrogation?

49:49.737 --> 49:51.237
He may have been, I don't know.

49:51.405 --> 49:55.367
Because if that is indeed the case,
the confessions, both of them, are out.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.662
If Nunally was there,
Mr. Crawford was under duress.

49:58.829 --> 50:01.456
Confessions and evidence gathered
with Nunally present...

50:01.624 --> 50:04.417
...will have to be excluded
as fruit of the poisonous tree.

50:04.585 --> 50:06.670
-This is insane.
-That's the Bible, isn't it?

50:06.837 --> 50:10.882
"The fruit of the tree" and all that?
It's Matthew. Or is it Mark?

50:11.050 --> 50:13.343
He set all this up.

50:13.552 --> 50:16.471
-This is a setup.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Beachum...

50:16.639 --> 50:19.974
...but I am not going to allow
coerced confessions in my courtroom.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.601
Do you think I could go home...

50:21.769 --> 50:24.312
-...with Thanksgiving around the corner?
-Unbelievable.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.147
Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.

50:26.941 --> 50:29.693
What I'll do is I'm going to give
Mr. Beachum a few days...

50:29.860 --> 50:34.739
...to come up with some new evidence.
If he can't, then maybe you can go home.

50:34.907 --> 50:39.160
So we will reconvene
on Monday morning.

50:39.328 --> 50:42.372
-I think that's all.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.001
Farewell.

50:53.300 --> 50:56.010
Didn't even have the guts
to come talk to me.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.347
I was going to...

50:59.515 --> 51:01.516
...after I figured out...

51:03.018 --> 51:04.436
...how I was gonna handle it.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.730
What makes you think
that's your decision?

51:08.983 --> 51:12.193
-You taking me off this case?
-Your bags are already packed.

51:12.361 --> 51:13.737
Just go.

51:15.239 --> 51:16.823
Even if I find new evidence?

51:16.991 --> 51:19.743
From where? The evidence store?

51:19.910 --> 51:22.495
What, are they open early
the day after Thanksgiving?

51:23.122 --> 51:26.332
My witness lied to me.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.210
Yes, because he could.
Because you weren't looking.

51:29.378 --> 51:30.462
And I know why.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.131
Your head was in the fast lane
on your big salary.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.842
You picked that and what we do
is not important anymore.

51:36.010 --> 51:38.553
So that's what this is about, isn't it?

51:39.096 --> 51:42.766
-I'm not gonna be like you in 20 years.
-Hey, you be very careful.

51:43.601 --> 51:45.185
You wanna judge me, be my guest...

51:45.352 --> 51:49.689
...but this thing was a setup.
The confession, everything.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.065
Maybe.

51:51.233 --> 51:55.445
But it didn't have to turn into
a public humiliation for this office.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.155
You walked in there unprepared.

51:57.323 --> 52:00.492
You were arrogant and sloppy,
and you did damage.

52:00.659 --> 52:02.702
How much, we don't even know yet.

52:02.870 --> 52:05.038
And I noticed
you didn't even care to ask.

52:05.206 --> 52:08.666
But don't worry yourself, Willy.
We'll clean up after you.

52:28.062 --> 52:30.230
Coming around....

52:31.816 --> 52:32.982
Yeah.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.277
- Hey, what can I get you?
- Bourbon.

52:45.329 --> 52:47.121
All right.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.833
So...

52:50.793 --> 52:53.253
...you got killed today.

52:53.546 --> 52:55.839
You gotta admire the cleverness of it.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.382
Oh, yeah?

52:57.550 --> 53:00.176
Sure, give the devil his due.

53:00.761 --> 53:03.179
So, what did Lobruto say?

53:03.514 --> 53:05.223
He took me off the case.

53:05.391 --> 53:06.599
Good.

53:06.767 --> 53:08.309
-Is it?
-Yeah.

53:08.477 --> 53:10.770
Damage control.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.856
Look, you don't know this guy.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.733
I had to fight with Burt today...

53:15.901 --> 53:18.486
...to stop him from firing you.

53:26.620 --> 53:27.662
You want this, right?

53:29.665 --> 53:31.249
Yeah.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.503
Good.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.509
I have to hang out here another hour...

53:41.886 --> 53:43.511
...so...

53:43.762 --> 53:46.139
...I think you should go home.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.225
And I'd like you to call me later.

53:54.273 --> 53:56.274
Call me later.

54:42.196 --> 54:43.780
You....

54:44.073 --> 54:46.783
You don't have to go, William.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.243
Yeah, I do.

55:02.549 --> 55:04.592
No big family Thanksgiving?

55:04.760 --> 55:06.344
No.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.890
Well, I have to...

55:11.141 --> 55:14.602
...put in some face time
with mine, if you want.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.900
All right.

55:25.447 --> 55:26.614
Thanks.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.202
Don't thank me yet.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.964
Mr. Beachum, can I help you?

56:25.132 --> 56:26.591
Look, please, Mr. Beachum.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.929
I want it back.

56:34.683 --> 56:37.143
I take complete responsibility
for what happened.

56:39.396 --> 56:42.648
Although I do feel like
it would have happened to anyone.

56:43.025 --> 56:48.279
But if I'd been paying attention,
it wouldn't have happened to me.

56:49.073 --> 56:53.076
I'm not giving you back this case
so you can repair your ego.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.370
Well, it's not just about my ego.

56:56.538 --> 57:01.042
It's also about the fact that this guy...

57:01.502 --> 57:03.544
...he's just enjoying all of this.

57:03.712 --> 57:07.048
Enjoying this? That's not evidence.

57:07.216 --> 57:08.633
Right...

57:08.801 --> 57:11.010
...but someone's gotta put him away.

57:13.305 --> 57:15.723
If you just give me a chance...

57:16.141 --> 57:19.685
...and if there is a way, I'll find it.

57:19.853 --> 57:22.313
And if you can't?

57:23.065 --> 57:25.942
Listen, you leave now, I replace you.

57:26.110 --> 57:29.112
I'm covered, I took some action.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.572
But if you go on with this
and you lose...

57:31.740 --> 57:34.951
...I guarantee you your shiny new job
will not be waiting for you...

57:35.119 --> 57:36.869
...and I can't keep you on here.

57:37.037 --> 57:39.872
This is a public office. Heads gotta roll.

57:43.752 --> 57:45.086
Still want it back?

57:51.802 --> 57:53.010
Thank you.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.139
Yeah.

57:57.724 --> 58:03.062
-The gun's in the house.
-Yeah, except it's also just not.

58:03.522 --> 58:06.440
Then what'd he do?
He tie it to a goddamn helium balloon?

58:06.608 --> 58:07.859
Maybe.

58:08.026 --> 58:11.154
Maybe he dissolved it in acid.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.489
You got a DOB on that?

58:13.657 --> 58:15.324
- You know, detective...
- Here it is.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.910
And that's the last known address?

58:18.453 --> 58:22.748
...your inability to do your job effectively
is making it very difficult for me to do mine.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.333
All right?

58:24.501 --> 58:27.753
I'm back in trial on Monday.

58:28.630 --> 58:32.675
Okay, fine. I'll get a team together.
I'll go over it one more time...

58:32.843 --> 58:34.427
...and that's it.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.938
My wife took the kids to her mom's.

58:46.106 --> 58:48.900
And I got the media
all over my front lawn.

58:49.067 --> 58:51.819
What were you thinking, huh?

58:51.987 --> 58:55.656
You get called to your
girlfriend's house.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.950
I didn't know it was her house.

58:58.118 --> 58:59.785
Well, it's her last name.

59:03.874 --> 59:06.083
I didn't know her last name.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.755
Not her real one, anyway.
We just--

59:11.715 --> 59:13.424
We met at the Miramar.

59:13.592 --> 59:16.719
Same time, twice a week and--

59:16.887 --> 59:21.349
There were no questions asked, no phone
calls and that's just-- Those were the rules.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.059
Those were her rules.

59:23.227 --> 59:26.395
All right. Did you get the feeling
that she had all these rules...

59:26.563 --> 59:29.607
...because she'd been doing it before
with other guys?

59:30.150 --> 59:31.692
Be honest.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.402
No.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.989
I don't know if you can understand
this because you're a fucking lawyer...

59:37.157 --> 59:39.283
...but this thing that we had,
it was real.

59:39.451 --> 59:43.412
It wasn't just an affair.
This girl, she made me feel like....

59:46.124 --> 59:47.541
What was I supposed to do?

59:49.169 --> 59:50.378
Tell me.

59:50.796 --> 59:52.588
I tried to warn you, didn't l?

59:54.549 --> 59:58.386
No, you warned me
that he was smart.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.430
You didn't warn me...

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.099
...that you were stupid.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.768
Fuck you, you little punk. Fuck you!

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:09.021
Fuck me? Well, you already did that.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.023
I didn't think that he knew, okay?

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.484
There was no way for me
to know that he knew.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.154
I just thought the guy
was fucking nuts, you know?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:42.263
- Y'all got security cameras, right?
- Yes, we do.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:45.182
Can I get a copy of those tapes
from November 10th?

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.101
As soon as I can.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:52.606
I'm just-- I'm under the gun here.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.618
That's exactly the way he left them?

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.788
-Yes.
-Mm-hm.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.008
What, were they planning
a trip next week?

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.427
Excuse me.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.765
Crawford Aeronautics.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.266
Yes, he is.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:29.143
It's for you.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.937
Just pick up Line 1 .

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:41.113
-Hello?
-Hey, Willy, old sport. How is it going?

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.616
Uh....

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:46.077
Well, I'm...

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.829
...still out here
and you're still in there, so....

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.456
Yeah, you're right there.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.833
So the world still makes sense,
does it?

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.877
Have you got everything
you need, Willy?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.295
Would you like some coffee?

01:01:58.256 --> 01:01:59.924
No, thank you.

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:01.926
Okay.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:04.512
You got some new evidence, have you?

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.766
What's the matter, Willy,
aren't we friends anymore?

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:13.020
I'm trying to help you. You're in a bad
place and you've nowhere else to turn.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:16.524
-Okay, I'm gonna hang up.
-Do me a favor, will you, pal?

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.859
Ask Tina to cancel my wife's tickets.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:21.612
Yeah, we had
plans to travel, you see.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.531
Get away, so to speak.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.951
Next week, actually. Sort of a,
you know, second honeymoon.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.913
Painfully ironic, that part, I must say.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:35.584
But I don't think Jennifer's
gonna make it, Willy. Do you?

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.348
Well...

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.892
...tore the whole thing apart.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.770
No gun.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:58.190
I'm sorry, Willy.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.653
Good night.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.310
"Do you dare stay out?

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.812
Do you dare go in?

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.148
How much can you lose?

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.026
How much can you win?

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:45.154
And if you go in,
should you turn left or right?

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:49.992
Or right and three-quarters?
Or maybe not quite?

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:54.580
You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race...

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:59.335
...down long wiggled roads
at a breaknecking pace...

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:03.506
...and grind on for miles
across weirdish wild space...

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:08.677
...headed, I fear, towards
a most useless place.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.222
The waiting place.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:15.351
For people just waiting.

01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:18.812
Waiting for a train to go.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.607
Or for a bus to come.

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.651
Or a plane to go.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.569
Or the mail to come.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.863
Or the rain to go.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.366
Or the phone to ring.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.952
Or the snow to snow.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:37.164
Or waiting around for a yes or a no.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:43.003
Or a string of pearls
or a pair of pants.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:46.507
Or a wig with curls.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.594
Or another chance."

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.514
What are you doing?

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:01.313
Uh....

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.900
I heard that it might help.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.235
Who told you that?

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.741
The guy who shot her.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.872
Are you a member of the family?

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.250
I'm from the district attorney's office.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.714
And we...

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:29.550
...ran out of witnesses.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.805
You know, she moved earlier.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.975
She moved her eyelids
like she was trying to open her eyes.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.644
Yeah, well sometimes
we have to tape their eyes shut.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:43.689
They all move, they--
They twitch, they make sounds.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.525
You think they're dreaming,
but they're not. It's just--

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.569
It's just what's left of the system.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.784
Normal reflex is downward.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.662
Up indicates brain trauma.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.541
If she comes back,
she may not remember how to speak...

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.251
...let alone who shot her.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:07.296
What if she can hear you?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.840
She can't.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:15.929
It happens, right?
People wake up. It's not impossible.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.142
You gonna ask
the same question different ways...

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.353
...till you get the answer you want?

01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:26.190
I guess. That's what I do.

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.863
I knew I should have gone
to law school.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:19.368
I thought it was so funny
when he did that dance at the end.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.213
Would you like some more wine?

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.887
-Are you not gonna eat your turkey?
-I'm a vegetarian.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.141
- White or dark meat this time?
- Oh, it doesn't matter...

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:45.185
-...Your Honor. Thank you.
-I think Willy's already chosen...

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:46.937
...the dark side.

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:49.314
Mr. Sierra Club and Ms. ACLU here...

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.442
...give me a hard time
at the holidays...

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:54.903
-...because I can buy and sell them.
-We're not actually for sale, Nik.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.740
Well, since you have
the advantage on all of us...

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.784
...surely it won't bother you
if we just mention...

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:04.538
...to Willy that he could put
his talents to more noble use.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:07.124
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, it's all right.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:09.334
I get this from time to time...

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.628
...and it's most always
from people with money.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.298
Oop. You win.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.175
I usually do.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.135
Except in trial this week.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.346
-Nice, Lee.
-It's not over till it's over.

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:24.390
That looked pretty over.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.935
Anyway, Willy's off the case, so....

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:32.649
Well, it may not seem like it now, Willy,
but it's really a blessing in disguise.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.444
Well, I'm actually not.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.322
-What?
-Off the case. I'm back on it.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:42.326
But that doesn't make any sense. Lobruto
has to do some kind of damage control.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.165
Yeah, well...

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.084
...I asked him to let me finish it.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.134
You didn't think
I might wanna know that?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.096
Did you hear me when I said I had
to convince Burt not to fire you?

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.352
Could we not do this here?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.604
Fine.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.818
Actually, I need to talk with you.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.992
You lied to me.
It doesn't work with me.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.245
I didn't lie.
I told you I could be ready...

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.121
...and I still can be ready in time.

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:30.499
I got one thing,
one thing I gotta do first.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.085
You're not in yet, Willy.
You pulled a stunt.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.421
-You got your foot in the door.
-I could still win this case.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.924
I don't care.
That's not what this is about.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.968
-What is it about?
-It's about whether...

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:42.719
...you can do what you're told.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.973
You wanted corporate, right?
That was the point.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.392
Did I misunderstand that?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.353
If you do this, if you win,
I'm still screwed.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.022
It says I don't know what
my subordinates are doing...

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.942
...my judgment is bad,
and I'm not in charge of my team.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.361
I went out on a limb.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.238
I told Burt this was over.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:05.367
I didn't ask you to do that, Nik.

01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:24.928
Know what nobody understands
about certain kinds...

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.764
...of low-paid public service work?

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.936
Every now and then
you get to put a fucking stake...

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.606
...in a bad guy's heart.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.483
Now, we're not supposed
to talk about that...

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:41.653
...when we visit a 3rd grade
classroom for Career Day.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:46.408
And it doesn't get you very far
into a country club locker room...

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.246
...but it's hard to beat
when you actually get to do it.

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:03.133
I have some work to do.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:05.886
Thank your family very much
for a lovely evening.

01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:08.430
Thank you, Judge Gardner.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.834
Officer.

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.340
We gotta find the gun.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.307
-I had three teams out there--
-He did this.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.686
We know he did it, right? So...

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.523
...let's find it.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.108
We can't.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:03.318
You wanna move on?

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:17.624
I know a guy in the evidence room
and he owes me a favor.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:23.338
He can swap these
for the shells in evidence...

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:27.509
...give us a ballistic match,
and we'll have our gun.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.644
Go home.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.604
What else you got, man?

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.189
Go home.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.525
What else you got, Willy?

01:12:52.452 --> 01:12:56.246
This is Willy
Beachum. You tell me what I need to know.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.249
Hey, it's me.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:03.962
Things sort of got
out of hand today and I guess....

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:07.883
I guess this is something neither of us
was expecting in our lives right now.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:10.927
And I think we have to....

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:15.515
I think we have to figure out
what to do about that.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:17.476
This is where to find me.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:19.394
Call me.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.483
You have one unheard message.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.903
Sent today at 4:10 p.m.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:30.655
Hi, Mr. Beachum.
This is Stephanie from Miramar Hotel.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.075
The security tapes you
were asking for are ready.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:37.120
You can pick them up any time
at the reception desk. Thanks.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.588
You know it's him, all right?

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.883
There's no doubt that that guy is him.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.678
Well, there's no face.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.681
So? We enhance it.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.353
-Enhance a hat?
-You know that is him...

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.563
...and he's there on the day
he shot her.

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:06.024
-And why is he there the day of?
-What?

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.985
-Why is he there the day of?
-What are you talking about?

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:12.114
This is a guy who plans everything
down to the hat, okay?

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:15.951
What's he doing there the day of?
What part of the plan is that?

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:17.869
What the f--

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:23.291
Okay. He's there because
he's gotta see it for himself.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.460
-They're at the pool.
-Yeah, at the pool.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.255
-He's jealous, his wife's having an affair.
-No, no, man.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:29.840
He's there, getting worked up.

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:33.051
He's about to shoot her, trying on
the dress, sniffing her panties.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.178
This guy, this guy here?

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:37.889
He's a psycho. And the point is
that you're missing...

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:40.725
...he's a psycho
we just caught on tape.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.478
-You got motive.
-I do not have motive.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.648
I don't have motive unless I have him...

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.276
...and I don't have face,
so I don't have him.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:52.320
-That is such lawyer shit.
-If is lawyer shit.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.365
Why do you think
I'm getting out of criminal law?

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:59.119
Huh? And I'll tell you, I'm not
gonna end my career on a case...

01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:02.372
...where all I have is an enhanced hat
when what I should've had...

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.708
-...was a murder weapon!
-That is new evidence.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.043
What I should've had
was a signed confession!

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.589
-I told you he was playing games.
-You and your men should have got that.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.591
-That is a cop-out.
-Don't tell me that.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:16.970
You couldn't find my gun and you let Nunally
take the confession of a guy he beat up.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:19.931
Nunally? Nunally lied to me,
that's what happened.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:28.690
-I gotta go make a case out of nothing.
-Just being an asshole.

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:56.551
- Beachum.
- It's done.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.512
In the toolshed,
taped to the lawn mower blade.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.154
Two-ten, eastbound. They were going
about 85 miles an hour....

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:02.617
District attorney's office.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.546
Can I talk to you?

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.762
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:32.397
-I'm not mad at you or anything.
-Oh, okay.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:36.026
Are you all right?

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.122
Can I ask you to do something
for me this morning?

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:50.707
Yeah.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:54.294
-You got your cell phone on you?
-Yeah.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:18:00.091
Could you sit outside the courtroom?

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:02.010
Because I might call you.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.929
And if I do...

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.349
...just hang up.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:12.520
And come inside and whisper
something in my ear about...

01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:15.565
...finding the murder weapon.

01:18:17.485 --> 01:18:19.069
You found it.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.324
I haven't decided that yet.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:34.334
Okay.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:10.286
Mr. Beachum. Mr. Beachum.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:12.664
- Sir?
- Mr. Beachum.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:15.667
Mr. Beachum. Mr. Beachum,
do you have any new evidence?

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:39.232
Mr. Beachum.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.359
Your Honor...

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.489
...I would like to submit
a motion at this time.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.492
What type of motion, Mr. Crawford?

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.162
I move for a judgment of acquittal.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.498
- Objection.
- On what grounds?

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:58.084
The prosecutor doesn't
have any actual evidence...

01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.711
...proving that I did anything.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.798
I'm about to present my evidence,
Your Honor.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.051
But all of his witnesses
will testify to the same facts.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.596
That my wife was shot
and that I was...

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:13.057
...tragically in the house at the time,
and in a way, a victim myself.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:16.519
I'll stipulate to the testimony of
Mr. Beachum's entire witness list.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:20.231
Accordingly I move for a judgment--
I'm sorry. Under the California...

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:23.276
...penal code, section 11-18.1 ,
for a judgment of acquittal...

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:27.155
...on the ground that the evidence is
insufficient to sustain a conviction.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:28.615
Thank you.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.367
Your legal skills
seem to have improved...

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.828
...over the long weekend,
Mr. Crawford.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:41.252
Mr. Beachum,
have you any new evidence?

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.962
Your Honor.

01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:49.344
May I have a moment, Your Honor?

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.792
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Beachum.

01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:35.848
Mr. Beachum.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.291
I have no further evidence
at this time, Your Honor.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:15.346
Motion for a judgment
of acquittal is granted.

01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:21.102
The jury is released with our apologies
and the defendant is free to go.

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:26.566
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:36.117
Well, even a broken clock
gets to be right twice a day.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:47.420
Hey, Rob, take it easy, huh?

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:14.030
Willy?

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:17.700
Hey, I just heard. I'm sorry.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:21.954
What'd you think,
I wasn't keeping tabs?

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:26.125
I don't know what I thought.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.671
Listen, what do you say...

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:33.132
...I take you out tonight
and get you completely trashed?

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.759
Tomorrow's just a travel day.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:38.888
What was that? Willy?

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.434
Are you there?

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.313
Over here.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:46.330
Initial there and there,
sign and date at the bottom.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:07.179
Mr. Beachum.

01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:11.559
What a surprise.
Now don't tell me, let me guess.

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:15.438
You've got religion or something, haven't
you? You've found God, all that stuff.

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:18.149
Because it's not just the winning
or the losing anymore.

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:20.401
It's the injustice of it.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.987
This is priceless.

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:27.408
Oh, come on, Willy. You gotta let me
enjoy this just a little bit, old sport.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.707
You really need to be nice
to me now, Willy.

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.173
Why?

01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:44.050
Because...

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:45.927
...what's left of a life...

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.137
...depends on a machine
powered by a cord...

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:51.974
...that leads to a plug
in an electrical outlet...

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:54.769
...and I decide when it gets pulled.

01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:56.979
That's why.

01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:40.231
- Excuse me. I'm looking for--
- I'll call you.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:42.942
- Oh, never mind. Thank you.
- I called you all night.

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:45.277
Listen, I need your help.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:47.405
I don't know anything
about civil court.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.156
I gotta get a restraining order...

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:52.034
-...or this guy's gonna pull the plug.
-What are you doing?

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:53.536
-What?
-You shouldn't be here.

01:28:53.704 --> 01:28:56.455
I gotta tie him up.
I gotta challenge his health-care proxy.

01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:58.624
I gotta find somebody.
I don't know who.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:00.584
Like a family member to stop him.

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:03.212
-I really tried, Willy.
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.006
Don't.

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:17.893
This man is gonna kill his wife.

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:22.023
And what does that have
to do with Wooton Sims?

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.850
Hey. Excuse me. Hey. Sorry.

01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:00.644
-Do you know any civil-court judges?
-Walk with me.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:03.856
Do you know any civil-court judges?

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:07.151
-I just need a number.
-Have you been at home at all today?

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:10.821
No, I've been trying to find somebody
who can put me in touch with a judge.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:13.407
There's a restraining order
out against you.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:16.660
I've got a restraining order against me?

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:18.746
You were at the hospital, right?

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:20.664
Overnight.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:24.168
-And he got one against me?
-Yeah. He has a lawyer now.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:27.588
-They went to Judge Gorman this morning.
-Who's his lawyer? Goldstein?

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:30.841
Listen to yourself.
He can have you arrested.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:34.804
Your one shot, you had it, okay?

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:37.223
I know I had one shot
and I blew it, all right?

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:40.935
Yeah. And he walked,
and there is nothing we can do.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:43.562
He's a private citizen now.
We have no standing.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.440
When you're done, you are done.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:48.984
Those are the rules.

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:53.155
What about her?

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:56.450
You have to worry about yourself now.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:01.705
No, I've, you know, done that.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:06.001
I've done a lot of that.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.740
Your Honor?

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:41.036
I got nowhere else to go.

01:31:48.128 --> 01:31:50.421
-Hi, Ted.
-Hi.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.716
It probably won't hold up on appeal.

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:56.677
I just need the time.

01:31:58.263 --> 01:31:59.305
Here we go.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:23.621
Reflexes, no change.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:40.346
Turn off the ventilator.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.833
Hey.

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:13.545
Hey.

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:24.265
-What's going on?
-Step outside.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.850
-I got a court order.
-I'm sorry. Just step outside.

01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:29.395
I got a-- I got a court order.

01:33:29.562 --> 01:33:32.147
-I'm sorry. Just step outside.
-I got a c--

01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:43.218
You're not answering your phone.

01:34:44.763 --> 01:34:47.681
That's kind of an answer
in itself, isn't it?

01:34:51.478 --> 01:34:52.936
Need a hand with this?

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:00.486
Can I get you a beer or something?

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:07.034
Thank you.

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:10.913
So, what now?

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.209
Something else.

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:24.176
You belong in a prosecutor's office.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:27.805
Well, what happened to
"heads must roll"?

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.724
Yeah, well, it's my office.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.686
At least until the next election.

01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.731
Thank you, but no thank you.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:40.943
We all lose, Willy.

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.365
I let a man get away with murder.

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.828
How am I supposed to live with that?

01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:53.497
Well, you learn to.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:57.709
Well, I hope not.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.466
All right.

01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:14.184
You know,
if it makes you feel any better...

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:17.479
...technically you let a man
get away with attempted murder.

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:20.232
For what it's worth.

01:37:07.906 --> 01:37:11.116
Yeah? All right. I got it all right here.
I finished the r--

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:15.787
It's in the box right now,
it's coming. It's-- Just a sec.

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:20.334
Hey, honey. I'm just on a call.
Yeah. Okay, just a sec.

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:23.003
No. I will not do that.

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:25.714
It's not-- And thank you. Good--

01:37:26.382 --> 01:37:30.761
Right. Well, I've--
Like I said, the reports are done.

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:33.013
They're on their way.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:35.015
Hey, hon. No, did you get the suit?

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:38.352
-Yeah, I got the cut.
-Can I read that?

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.728
Okay, hon.

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:41.980
I'll pick up the kids,
see you at the school.

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:44.024
I'll bring the suit.

01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:46.235
No, I'll be there. I'm leaving right now.

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:50.072
I am not going to be late, okay?

01:37:50.406 --> 01:37:52.783
Hey. Why don't you go home?

01:37:54.035 --> 01:37:55.827
Get a life.

01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.456
Alrighty.

01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:03.544
Turn off the lights when you're done.
Yeah, hon?

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.424
It's yours.

01:38:17.267 --> 01:38:19.977
-Yeah.
-Hello, old sport.

01:38:25.358 --> 01:38:29.111
Willy, can you hear me?

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:33.115
I called to say goodbye.

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:38.453
I'm leaving tonight on that second
honeymoon we talked about.

01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:42.291
Won't be quite the same
without our Jennifer, though, will it?

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:46.169
Anyway, I have
a little something for you.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:48.589
It's a present, a little gift...

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:51.592
...and I was gonna send it
to Wooton Sims but...

01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:54.428
...I guess that's not
working out anymore.

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:58.348
And the DA's office didn't
have a forwarding address.

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:04.021
Um, do you have any suggestions?

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:31.173
Just let yourself in. I'll be right out.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:29.648
Good evening, Willy.

01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:38.365
So, what do you think?

01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:42.035
Oh, yeah, that's...

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.162
...really...

01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:46.164
...really, really nice of you.

01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:52.713
A simple "no, thank you"...

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.466
...is the preferred etiquette
when declining a gift.

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:05.308
It takes a very special sort of person...

01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:10.480
...to look into someone's eyes
and shoot them, Willy.

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:15.610
A certain kind of strength...

01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:17.404
...if you know what I mean.

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:22.367
Well, I guess you'd know that,
wouldn't you?

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.202
Oh, yes, I would.

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:31.334
Anyway...

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:33.712
...I've got another bag to pick up.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.256
Don't you start shooting
without me now, will you?

01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:54.274
I noticed something.

01:41:58.029 --> 01:41:59.905
It's a little late.

01:42:01.199 --> 01:42:03.742
Oh, hell, it's a lot late.

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.453
But I noticed...

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:08.830
...that...

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.880
...you and Nunally
have the exact same gun.

01:42:19.675 --> 01:42:21.343
So?

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:24.387
That's why you went to the hotel
that afternoon, isn't it?

01:42:26.933 --> 01:42:28.892
You took his,
you put yours in his place.

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:36.441
I gave it back.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:40.904
Right, you gave it back.

01:42:42.824 --> 01:42:45.325
And all he could see was her.

01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:49.621
And then you knew
that he would just...

01:42:50.665 --> 01:42:54.000
...walk the murder weapon
right out of the house, didn't you?

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:58.463
That's very clever.

01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:04.886
It wasn't just clever.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.223
Admit it, Willy. It was beautiful.

01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:11.977
He sat through the entire trial...

01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:16.606
...wearing the only piece
of evidence on his hip.

01:43:17.483 --> 01:43:19.150
Yeah.

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:21.570
Then he used it on himself.

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:29.703
Sometimes life gives us
these little gifts...

01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:31.413
...if you know what I mean.

01:43:33.583 --> 01:43:35.292
I do know what you mean.

01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:38.336
I know exactly
what you mean because...

01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:41.715
...I got the bullet.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.470
The one in your wife's head.

01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:50.348
That one we couldn't take out
as long as she was alive.

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:56.396
I'm pretty sure it's gonna match Nunally's
and that gives me the murder weapon.

01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:06.031
Nicely done, Willy.

01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:09.576
Truly.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.926
A regular chain of evidence.

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:28.178
Great stuff.

01:44:28.387 --> 01:44:30.013
Vivid.

01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:31.932
Heartbreaking.

01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:35.852
The victim cries out
from beyond the grave.

01:44:37.438 --> 01:44:41.441
Yeah. Jurors love all that sort of crap,
don't they?

01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:44.110
I bet you don't even need
a confession anymore...

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:46.404
...do you, Willy?

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:51.201
I tell you what, though, old sport.
Let's make you a new one just in case.

01:44:51.369 --> 01:44:54.621
The real deal, all the juicy details.

01:44:55.873 --> 01:44:59.209
You can get your rocks off on that,
then, can't you? Huh?

01:45:00.836 --> 01:45:02.379
Yeah.

01:45:05.466 --> 01:45:09.469
I shot my wife in the face, right there.

01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:12.180
She didn't look so pretty after that.

01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:14.766
And I stood there
looking down at her...

01:45:14.934 --> 01:45:18.561
...and I watched her eyes go all empty.

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:21.189
I could smell the blood and the shit.

01:45:23.067 --> 01:45:26.069
Smelled like metal.
And the look on his face.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:29.698
He was trying to get her back to life
and I was pissing myself laughing...

01:45:29.865 --> 01:45:34.869
...because I took both the bastards out
with one fucking bullet.

01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:39.082
Yeah.

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:42.168
And now you've got your
little bullet, haven't you?

01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:44.045
Got what you want.

01:45:44.213 --> 01:45:47.507
So bring it all on, kiddo.
Bring it all into court.

01:45:47.675 --> 01:45:51.302
Except you can't.

01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:53.263
Can you?

01:45:54.265 --> 01:45:57.434
Let's see, now, first year law,
double jeopardy.

01:45:57.601 --> 01:46:00.353
I went to trial, you lost.
Oh, pity about that.

01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:03.940
It doesn't matter what you do now.

01:46:04.108 --> 01:46:06.443
It doesn't matter what you know.

01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:09.320
I mean, she could come back
from the dead, you see...

01:46:09.488 --> 01:46:12.991
...and testify, spill the beans,
and it would mean...

01:46:13.159 --> 01:46:14.576
...nothing.

01:46:19.874 --> 01:46:24.127
So you can't touch me...

01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:26.755
...ever.

01:46:38.184 --> 01:46:40.310
She was alive.

01:46:48.944 --> 01:46:53.198
When you first went to trial
for attempted murder...

01:46:53.365 --> 01:46:56.076
...your wife was still alive.

01:46:58.871 --> 01:47:02.207
But you just had to pull that plug,
didn't you?

01:47:05.628 --> 01:47:07.504
Well, now she's dead,
and that's murder.

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:11.633
That's homicide, first degree,
and that's new charges.

01:47:11.801 --> 01:47:14.135
That's new evidence.

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:17.931
That's a new trial.

01:47:23.687 --> 01:47:26.689
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:47:29.527 --> 01:47:31.111
All right.

01:47:35.574 --> 01:47:38.451
I just don't know
why you didn't let it go.

01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:42.455
The doctor said...

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:45.333
...she probably would have
outlived us all.

01:48:19.076 --> 01:48:20.118
All rise.

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:25.373
The Superior Court of Los Angeles...

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:28.543
...People of the State of California
v. Theodore Crawford.

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:32.797
The Honorable
Judge Joseph Pincus presiding.

01:48:36.135 --> 01:48:37.177
Looking good.

01:48:43.475 --> 01:48:45.685
Are the People ready, Mr. Beachum?

01:48:48.272 --> 01:48:49.314
Very well.

01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:52.233
We will now proceed
with opening statements.

01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:55.862
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury....
