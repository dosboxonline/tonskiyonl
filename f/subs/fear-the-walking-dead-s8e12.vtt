this will be a moment

54:38.013 --> 54:39.885
where Madison will be
kind of devastated,

54:40.059 --> 54:42.496
but instead, Madison is glad

54:42.670 --> 54:45.978
that Tracy has learned
this very dark lesson,

54:46.152 --> 54:50.112
because she thinks
that's what Tracy will need
to carry forward to live.

54:50.287 --> 54:53.942
It's this deeply cynical,
broken aspect to Madison

in such a heightened way before.

For us, it's a sad moment
because we've seen kind of

54:58.773 --> 55:01.559
how far Madison has fallen
as a character,

55:01.733 --> 55:05.563
that she actually believes that
with every fiber of her being.

the Saint Christopher's medal.

Madison realizes she does need
to live for something better,

55:21.709 --> 55:23.189
in a better way.

55:25.496 --> 55:28.847
regain the trust
of this grandchild, really,

55:29.021 --> 55:31.763
is to show her how to live
and to be a better person

55:31.937 --> 55:33.808
and to sacrifice herself again.

55:33.982 --> 55:36.158
And she knew she was going to
have to do something major.

We had all of our characters
kind of at this crossroad

something better,
