It's office birthdays today
at the brewery.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.750
Ever since your father
was put in charge,

00:41.833 --> 00:43.835
he's been taking it
very seriously.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.837
Okay, Brian,
what do you got for me?

00:45.920 --> 00:47.756
Okay, birthday jokes.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.301
"We may be colleagues, but
there's no one in your league."

00:51.384 --> 00:53.094
Boy, that's a brick
off the backboard.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.429
Chris, what do you got?

00:54.512 --> 00:57.140
"I drove the family
to Disneyland for vacation,

00:57.223 --> 00:59.726
"and when we got off
the highway, the sign said,

00:59.809 --> 01:03.146
'Disneyland, Left,'
so we drove back home."

01:04.147 --> 01:05.982
Chris, that's going in the show.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.108
See that, Brian?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.693
Don't be afraid
to pull the heartstrings.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.112
Peter, don't you think you might
be putting too much time

01:11.196 --> 01:13.698
into office birthdays
and not enough into your job?

01:13.782 --> 01:16.493
Come on, Lois. It's the one
thing I look forward to at work.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.952
It's the one thing I'm good at.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.372
I am to birthdays
what J.K. Rowling is

01:20.455 --> 01:22.874
to now-problematic
wizard stories.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.709
Perhaps Slytherin

01:24.793 --> 01:27.587
or maybe Hufflepuff

01:27.671 --> 01:30.507
or trans women
aren't really women.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.549
Wait, what?

01:31.633 --> 01:34.344
I mean, uh,
the first two things.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.472
Okay, who's the next
girl or boy?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.224
There's only those two.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.355
Who's ready for June birthdays?

01:50.026 --> 01:53.405

02:34.738 --> 02:36.656
Wait, isn't it November?

02:36.740 --> 02:39.534
Who cares? They are marvelous.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.125
So I drove my family
down to Disneyland for vacation.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.002
When we got off the highway,
the sign said,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.838
"Disneyland, Left,"
so we drove back home.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.634
Thanks. I wrote that.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.678
Oh, I'll show him.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.059
I own the school paper.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.144
Get me dirt
on Principal Shepherd's car.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.396
I also own the school car wash.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.190
Myeah. Myeah.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.571
Children, please continue
independent play

03:16.654 --> 03:19.908
while I go see
if I just sneezed my tampon out.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.744
Let's see. Any good reads here?

03:22.827 --> 03:24.037
Hmm, what's this?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.582
Hmm.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.959
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.961
My word, this is brilliant.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.924
Now to find my mark.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.843
Hey, Stewie. What you reading?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.096
Something with
different cloths to feel?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.848
No, not since, uh...
not since COVID.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.519
I say, Doug, it appears you've
got something on your shirt.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.853
Is that so?

04:08.707 --> 04:11.042
Ha-ha!
There's nothing on your shirt!

04:11.126 --> 04:12.627
It was all a ruse.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.176
Doug, are you okay?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.845
Oh, my God, what happened?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.222
- Who did this to you?
- Stewie.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.391
Stewart Griffin-Suarez,
is that true?

04:26.474 --> 04:27.392
No!

04:27.475 --> 04:28.435
And thank you for that.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.978
Rupert and I
decided to hyphenate.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.272
I hope it doesn't make me look
like too much of a pushover.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.190
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.650
Screw it.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.901
Yes, I hit him.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.653
And it was glorious.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.947
This is
your third strike, Stewie.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.657
That means no more time-outs.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.992
You get a detention.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.326
Detention?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.120
You can't scare me.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.497
The only thing that scares me
is a sudden loud noise,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.082
even if it's only spoken.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.751
<i>We now return to Val Kilmer</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:53.918
<i>and Robert Downey Jr.</i>

04:54.002 --> 04:55.170
<i>-in</i> Kiss Kiss...
- Ooh!

04:55.253 --> 04:56.713
-...Bang Bang!

04:59.758 --> 05:02.093
So, how did
the birthday thing go?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.428
Amazing, Lois.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.305
I've even been asked
to do a TED Talk.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.475
What is a birthday?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.810
I think it can best
be understood by breaking down

05:10.894 --> 05:13.688
the word "birth" and "day."

05:13.772 --> 05:15.774
Where the hell is everyone?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.776
Ah, okay. Now it makes sense.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.033
Bye-bye, Stewie.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.368
Yeah, buh-bye, whatever.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.869
Stewie, where are you headed?

05:27.952 --> 05:29.329
You've got detention
this morning.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.747
That's where I'm headed.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.541
Stewie, no, detention
isn't in preschool.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.460
It's in
the elementary school building.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.713
The elementary school?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.465
But that's where
the big kids are.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.053
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I ruins y'all's reveal?

05:45.136 --> 05:47.222
Let me go ahead
and scooch back a little.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.724
Beep, beep, beep.

05:51.267 --> 05:55.146
Oh, no!
Look at that big scary school!

06:07.992 --> 06:10.161
My God, these kids
have their teeth.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.872
And where are their pacifiers?
How do they ever sleep?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.791
Detention kids are scary.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.293
Especially that fourth grader
writing on the board.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.882
Ah, that is such a load of

06:22.966 --> 06:25.677
truth, a wonderful
load of truth.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.809
All right, birthdays.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.352
Whoop, whoop!

06:34.436 --> 06:36.271
What the hell is this?

06:36.354 --> 06:37.814
It's happy birthday

06:37.897 --> 06:39.024
to you.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.442
I didn't approve this.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.901
Oh, yeah? Well, who the hell are

06:41.985 --> 06:42.986
you-you?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.446
I'm Preston Lloyd,

06:44.529 --> 06:47.032
the new manager of the brewery
and your boss.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.742
Is that true-true?

06:48.825 --> 06:52.912
Yes. And I've been charged with
improving brewery productivity.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.874
And it has become clear to me
that the best way to start is

06:55.957 --> 06:58.877
by canceling office birthdays,
effective immediately.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.503
I don't know how to stop
on roller skates,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.797
so hang on until
I run out of momentum.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.134
What?!

07:12.140 --> 07:15.143
But, Mr. Lloyd, you can't
cancel office birthdays.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.228
I'm pretty sure I can.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.315
Mr. Griffin, I like
focused, productive employees.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.234
But this is a brewery.
Beer is supposed to be fun.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.445
I've been sober for 46 years.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.280
- How old are you?
- 46.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
A brewery is not about
getting drunk.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.575
It's a business.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.161
I need disciplined,
productive employees.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.662
Can you be that, Mr. Griffin?

07:34.746 --> 07:36.164
Oh, heavens, no.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.041
Then we're going to have
a problem.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.502
But, Mr. Lloyd, you can't
take away office birthdays.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.503
People love 'em.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.423
If it means that much
to the employees, fine.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.508
Yay!

07:46.591 --> 07:48.093
- I'll do them.
- Aw.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.178
- Attention, employees.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.805
This is Mr. Lloyd, your manager.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.223
I will now resume

07:53.306 --> 07:55.058
the office birthday celebration
from earlier.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.021
Helen Daily, date of birth
12/10/1968.

08:00.105 --> 08:04.359
Martin Burke, date of birth
12/13/1969.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.570
J.H. Christ, 12/25...

08:07.654 --> 08:10.865
zero, zero, zero, zero.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.493
You now have two minutes
to consume cake.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.590
Hey, do you know where I can
get a pacifier in this place?

08:27.674 --> 08:28.633
I'm jonesing.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.719
Anyone hears you
say that in here,

08:30.802 --> 08:32.262
you'll get your ass kicked.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.265
You're the "something
on your shirt" kid, right?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.391
How did you know?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.686
Well, I make it
my business to know.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.396
You got purdy lips.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.314
Why, thank you.
It's a new serum.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.817
Move over, lip balms.
The secret is retinol.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.110
Let's talk later.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.574
I can't believe
the new jerk manager

08:52.657 --> 08:54.075
canceled office birthdays.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.327
It was the one thing in life
I looked forward to.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.330
Is this manager
a no-nonsense, button-down man

08:59.414 --> 09:01.291
who's also been in the military?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.209
- How'd you know?
- Mm-hmm.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.337
- Well, what do I do?
- Take it from a lawman,

09:05.420 --> 09:07.505
whenever authorities have tried
to take away something

09:07.589 --> 09:09.090
the people find precious,

09:09.174 --> 09:11.593
the people have found ways
around the law.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.429
They always find a way,
like nature.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.056
- Look at that.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.184
Tree bent to keep growing
toward the sun.

09:19.267 --> 09:23.146
Anyway, I'm Joe,
and I don't do a lot of these.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.068
Boy, wouldn't you like to know

09:28.151 --> 09:30.278
what those little guys
are saying?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.665
What's the password?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.167
"Fat man."

09:53.885 --> 09:56.054
I'd like to wish
all you birthday boys and girls

09:56.137 --> 09:58.098
a special day
with the help of...

09:58.181 --> 09:59.182
The Beatles.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.184
One, two, three, hit it.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.068
The boss is coming.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.077
And this is our final stop
on the tour.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.286
What's this room?

10:20.370 --> 10:21.996
Oh, this is
an unused meeting room

10:22.080 --> 10:23.832
that no one pays attention to.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.583
Ah. Well, then,

10:25.667 --> 10:28.169
I suppose there's no need
to pay any attention.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.301
Okay, there was an elderly
Jewish family hiding in there,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.470
and I don't know
what to tell them.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.184
Well, Stewie, you've completed
your detention.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.894
What have you learned
from this experience?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.438
That your mother's a whore.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.737
Hey, Stewie.
How was your detention?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.156
Brian Griffin,
is that really you?

10:56.239 --> 10:57.657
Been a long time, it has.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.075
I saw you this morning.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.495
The world's gone and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.914
You lose track of time
on the inside, Brian.

11:04.998 --> 11:05.999
You wouldn't know.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.625
You ain't seen
the things I've seen.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.253
Preschool detention?
No, I guess I haven't.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.255
- What'd you do in there?
- Got jacked.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.175
- You look exactly the same.
- And yet I got jacked.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.889
Okay, time to make
this office my own

11:20.972 --> 11:23.850
and decorate it
with my prized achievements.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.269
Ah, let's start with
my Big Mouth Billy Bass

11:26.353 --> 11:27.812
with the battery removed

11:27.896 --> 11:30.732
so I don't have to be
interrupted by that nonsense.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.527
Ah, my framed ticket stub

11:34.611 --> 11:37.364
from opening night of
<i>Independence Day.</i>

11:37.447 --> 11:39.199
My Purple Heart.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.997
Today, for
a special birthdays treat,

11:46.081 --> 11:48.208
I've acquired Marty McFly's amp.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.764
Who's ready to rock birthdays?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.520
There.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.231
A lifetime of
fragilely framed achievements.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.901
What the hell?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.242
Mr. Lloyd!

12:22.325 --> 12:23.743
What is going on in here?

12:25.787 --> 12:28.081
Ow! Ow! Aah!

12:28.164 --> 12:29.582
Sorry.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.042
Aah! That didn't work!

12:31.126 --> 12:32.460
Ow, my bones!

12:32.544 --> 12:34.629
I had a very good rotation guy
work on this.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.214
Ow, though!

12:36.297 --> 12:38.717
Ow! Please stop!

12:38.800 --> 12:40.343
Sorry. Sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.387
I'll call the guy. I-I don't
know, I don't know what to say.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.222
Griffin, is this some kind of

12:44.305 --> 12:46.516
secret birthday
celebration room?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.519
I made a decision
to cancel office birthdays,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.521
and it was very explicit.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.731
There was nudity?

12:52.814 --> 12:55.984
Mr. Griffin, you leave me
no other choice.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.236
- You're fired.
- Fired?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.488
Can I still get paid
and just not come?

13:00.572 --> 13:01.740
No.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.908
Well, I guess
it's time to say goodbye

13:03.992 --> 13:06.494
to the security guards
whose names I never learned.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.788
Take care, Cap'n.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.331
Stay golden, Chief.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.125
Be well, Buckaroo.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.169
Bye,
Francesca Louise Allessandro.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.796
Say hi to Max and Samuel
and your sister Eloise for me.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.798
And good luck
with your night courses.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.717
Hey, do you have, like,
a nickname on Instagram?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.010
I'm having trouble finding you.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.310
I can't believe you were fired
from the brewery.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.312
I mean, how are we gonna
pay our bills?

13:32.395 --> 13:33.480
That depends.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.315
When you use Venmo,
do they just, like,

13:35.398 --> 13:36.941
believe you
that you have the money?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.443
No.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.236
- Right?
No.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.072
Fine. Maybe they'll take me back

13:42.155 --> 13:44.741
as the Radio City Rockette
with too-big shoes.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.998
Shoes!

13:57.671 --> 13:58.963
Shoes!

13:59.047 --> 14:00.882
Should we just get him
smaller shoes?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.926
Wouldn't matter.
He butters his feet.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.306
Stewie, breakfast!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.195
When did this new slab of beef
get delivered?

14:22.278 --> 14:24.239
My name's Chris.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.157
You don't have a name
until I give you one.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.369
You're a little young and plump
to be in a place like this.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.537
You need a friend.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.997
Someone who can provide you
with protection.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.582
I could be your friend.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.043
All we'll need is
a BIC pen and a lighter.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.213
Why? So you can burn
a swastika into my butt?

14:40.296 --> 14:43.049
Well, you just ruined
the surprise, you goofball.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.474
Oh. Stewie.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.561
What brings you by?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.312
You're gonna give me
what I want.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.690
Um, wh-what are you
talking about?

14:58.773 --> 15:00.233
You know.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.736
We're doing this, and you're
gonna find a way to enjoy it.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.079
I-I don't like it.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.582
I don't understand
what's happening.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.084
The three sisters have
a magic hopscotch board

15:18.168 --> 15:19.627
that turns them
into superheroes,

15:19.711 --> 15:21.671
but only at night
and never if it's raining.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.424
It's too complicated and noisy.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.384
Yeah, it is
both of those things.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.303
And their cat speaks French.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.640
Yeah. Yeah.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.270
Oh, there you are, Rupert.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.481
Funny how I never got
a visit in detention.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.732
Not even a letter.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.777
What do you mean
you couldn't find a stamp?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.153
Well, no need to mail it now.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.571
Show me the letter.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.073
Show me the damn letter!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.866
I met a new friend in detention.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.868
His name is
Thomas the Shank Engine.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.120
I think it's time you two met.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.747
You want to meet him?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.082
What's going on in here?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.334
You don't know
what detention was like, Brian.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.711
I feel like I aged
four years in there.

16:01.795 --> 16:05.382
On the first day, an older boy
put two fingers on my nose

16:05.465 --> 16:08.051
and just took it right off my
face and held it in front of me

16:08.134 --> 16:10.136
and said, "I got it.
I got your nose."

16:10.220 --> 16:11.638
That ever happen to you, Brian?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.265
You ever seen your own nose
wiggling between two fingers

16:14.349 --> 16:16.101
right in front of your face?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.686
And he never gave it back.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.563
- Stewie, what's going on
in here?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.190
Okay, you are coming with me.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.526
They've got my nose, Brian.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.861
They've got my nose.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.156
They've got my--

16:30.240 --> 16:31.324
Ah.

16:31.408 --> 16:32.659
This changes everything.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.119
Ooh, bubbles!

16:34.202 --> 16:37.789
Aw, looks like somebody was
overdue for his bath time.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.583
That's why you've been
so cranky.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.962
All right, after this, we'll get
you into your footsie jammies

16:44.045 --> 16:46.297
and tucked into bed.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.884
Ah, finally, I can put
that whole detention experience

16:49.968 --> 16:51.845
behind me and just live.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.515
Whoa.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.434
Yep, so that's how your granddad

16:57.517 --> 16:59.769
got his back tattoo
and hepatitis.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.396
Never share a needle
with Ben Affleck.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.523
How did you
and Other Granddaddy meet?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.150
That's a story
for when you're older.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.485
The kids at school were asking
if you're a bottom or a top.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.029
They should not be asking that.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.197
They said if that was your
answer, then you were a bottom.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.033
Who are these kids
you're talking to?

17:13.116 --> 17:15.827
I would like to have a word
with their attractive fathers.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.500
And that's how you say
"productivity"

17:22.584 --> 17:24.294
in 11 different languages,

17:24.377 --> 17:27.756
which, in hindsight, was not
a productive use of time.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.132
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.176
I just came to clear the
search history off my computer

17:31.259 --> 17:33.636
before the I.T. guy--
uhp, he's already got it.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.473
Boy, you're really all in
on Asa Akira.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.017
Way off, pal. This is
the only place I can masturbate.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.102
Griffin, just go.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.989
Oh, fat man, my fat man.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.532
Mr. Pabian.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.326
Get down from there at once.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.456
Oh, fat man, my fat man.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.083
Ms. Towers, get down.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.710
Do you hear me?
I order you to get down.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.837
Oh, fat man, my fat man.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.256
Get down! Every one of you.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.676
That is a direct order.
Do you hear me?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.553
Oh, fat man, my fat man.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.430
Oh, fat man,
my fat man.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.016
Oh...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.644
Thank you all. Thank you.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.566
As someone
who doesn't remember movies,

18:28.650 --> 18:32.195
I've never seen such an original
display of faith in a colleague.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.864
- Peter, you're rehired.
- Really?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.867
Griffin, I guess I've learned

18:37.951 --> 18:41.162
that employees are
willing to endure a crappy job,

18:41.246 --> 18:44.541
low pay, meaningless work,
no upward mobility,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.877
laughable benefits packages,
countless OSHA violations,

18:47.961 --> 18:50.797
exposure to hazardous waste
and emotional abuse

18:50.880 --> 18:54.551
as long as there are balloons
and pieces of cake once a month.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.428
I guess I can allow that.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.976
And I've learned that every
office needs a worst employee

19:03.059 --> 19:05.395
that all the other employees
can look down on.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.981
I can be that.
I can be that guy.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.774
Now, if you'll excuse me.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.777
Hey-hey,
Francesca Louise Allessandro!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.779
Good news.
I found your Instagram.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.698
Did you see the 90 photos
I liked in a row

19:16.781 --> 19:18.366
last night at 2:00 a.m.?

19:18.450 --> 19:21.703
Also, who's @BeckyFitness96, and
can you tell her to unblock me?

19:27.709 --> 19:30.295
Well, Peter, I'm glad
you got your job back.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.130
Me, too, Lois,
but I am gonna miss

19:32.213 --> 19:33.548
getting to perform every week.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.052
You don't need to be in charge
of birthdays to perform.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.720
You know, you're right, Chris.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.931

What are you doing here?

19:56.404 --> 19:58.198
I heard you were
singing my song,

19:58.281 --> 20:00.325
but I think
you got the words wrong.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.911
It isn't "hana-wanna-dada-baba."

20:02.994 --> 20:06.581
- It's "da-zalway-da-da-zee-za."
- Oh, oh, okay.

And then is it, uh,
something about <i>Nash Bridges?</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:12.420
No, it's "all the little bit

20:12.504 --> 20:14.422
Ah, "little bit of dridges,"
of course.

That's from the 1945 Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical

20:48.623 --> 20:51.126
<i>Carousel,</i> about
carousel barker Billy Bigelow,

20:51.209 --> 20:53.378
whose romance with
mill worker Julie Jordan

20:53.461 --> 20:55.547
comes at the price
of both their jobs.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.091
If you want to know more
about it, ask your grandfather,

20:58.174 --> 20:59.884
who was dragged
to see it on a date

20:59.968 --> 21:01.928
and then had to get married
to touch boob.
