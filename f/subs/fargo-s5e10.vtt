- Daddy likes talking.
- [Wayne] Yeah.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.533
- [laughter]
- A lot.
- [Dot] Yeah.

40:34.533 --> 40:38.069
I, uh...
You ever drive a Kia, Mr. Moonk?

40:38.069 --> 40:40.105
It's like flying a cloud.

40:46.011 --> 40:49.047
I think we should see how
your biscuits turned out, huh?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.617
Before the boat,

40:51.617 --> 40:54.720
the man lived on the moors...

40:55.987 --> 40:58.957
...and ate fleas

40:58.957 --> 41:01.527
from the rats.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.767
He was frightened
all the time.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.371
Then one day,

41:13.371 --> 41:16.975
a man comes on a wealthy horse

41:16.975 --> 41:18.977
and offers him

41:18.977 --> 41:20.979
two coins

41:20.979 --> 41:23.081
and a meal.

41:28.453 --> 41:31.289
But the food

41:31.289 --> 41:34.125
was not food.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.562
What was it?

41:39.898 --> 41:42.167
It was sin.

41:44.069 --> 41:47.105
The sins of the rich.

41:47.105 --> 41:51.076
Greed, envy, disgust.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.779
They were bitter--

41:53.779 --> 41:56.615
the sins.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.450
But he ate them all,

41:59.450 --> 42:03.154
for he was starving.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.159
From then on,

42:08.159 --> 42:12.063
the man does not sleep

42:12.063 --> 42:15.934
or grow old.

42:15.934 --> 42:19.037
He cannot die.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.611
He has no dreams.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.550
All that is left...

42:36.154 --> 42:38.223
...is sin.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.734
It feels like that, I know.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.439
What they do to us,

42:54.439 --> 42:56.742
make us swallow.

42:57.809 --> 43:00.078
Like it's our fault.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.817
But you want to know the cure?

43:14.125 --> 43:16.094
You got to eat something

43:16.094 --> 43:18.897
made with love and joy.
