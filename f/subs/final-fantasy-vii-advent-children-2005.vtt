01:31.592 --> 01:36.971
498 Years Earlier

01:37.931 --> 01:40.850
Why does humankind even bother?

01:41.518 --> 01:45.146
You wreck everything
you've ever made...

01:45.731 --> 01:49.233
...then you start over like it'll be
any different the next time.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.866
I suppose we're no good
at facing our memories.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.494
We'd rather gild the past...

02:00.078 --> 02:04.999
...find something worthwhile among
the rubble and build a future with that.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.211
And that's why you
salvaged Mother?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.713
To "gild the past"?

02:12.591 --> 02:17.428
We were trying to rid ourselves
of a more immediate problem.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.431
You can't mean the stigma?

02:20.599 --> 02:24.060
But you're the ones who brought
that on yourselves in the first place.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.522
Well, now.

02:27.689 --> 02:32.276
I guess you really
do have a short memory.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.822
No. Not me.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.408
You see, it is my choice to forget.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.923
Two Weeks Earlier

02:54.091 --> 02:57.426
Tseng! Look at this.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.474
Pay dirt.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.269
Not a pretty sight, is it?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.272
Who cares?
Just get the damn thing.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.524
Reno, the chopper.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.985
You got it.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.587
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Reno, hurry!

03:34.798 --> 03:38.175
-Reno!
-Who the hell is that?!

03:42.890 --> 03:44.599
Elena!

03:45.851 --> 03:48.185
Get out!

03:58.822 --> 04:00.489
Damn it.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.368
The Lifestream.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.664
That's what we call the river of life
that circles our planet...

04:49.831 --> 04:54.919
...giving life to the world
and everything in it.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.465
The Shinra Electric Power Company
discovered a way...

04:59.633 --> 05:03.386
...to use the Lifestream
as an energy source.

05:03.553 --> 05:09.892
Because of Shinra's energy, we were
able to live very comfortable lives.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.063
But wasn't that because we were
taking away from the planet's life?

05:14.231 --> 05:17.650
A lot of people thought so.

05:19.069 --> 05:25.741
Shinra used their power to try and
stop anybody who got in their way.

05:26.743 --> 05:32.081
Shinra had a special group
of warriors called SOLDIER.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.793
And all of the SOLDIERs
had Jenova cells put inside them.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.255
Jenova was a calamity that fell
from the sky a long, long time ago...

05:39.423 --> 05:42.508
...and tried to destroy the planet.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.054
Anyway, there was one SOLDIER
named Sephiroth...

05:47.222 --> 05:50.933
...who was better than the rest.

05:51.101 --> 05:55.771
But when he found out about the
terrible experiments that made him...

05:55.939 --> 05:58.941
...he began to hate Shinra.

05:59.109 --> 06:04.280
And then, over time,
he began to hate everything.

06:05.949 --> 06:10.494
Shinra and the people
against them.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.621
Sephiroth, who hated
the planet so much...

06:12.789 --> 06:16.459
...he wanted to make it go away.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.628
And the people who tried
to stop him.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.132
There were a lot of battles.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.596
For every battle,
there was more sadness.

06:28.764 --> 06:34.560
Someone l love went back
to the Lifestream too.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.190
And then, it came.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.233
The chosen day.

06:41.401 --> 06:47.656
In the end, the planet itself had to
make the battles stop for good.

06:47.824 --> 06:53.245
The planet used the Lifestream
as a weapon...

06:53.413 --> 06:56.624
...and when it burst out
of the earth...

06:56.792 --> 07:00.377
...all the fighting,
all the greed and sadness...

07:00.545 --> 07:03.672
...everything was washed away.

07:07.010 --> 07:11.180
"Sadness was the price
to see it end."

07:11.348 --> 07:15.017
It's been two years
since they told me that.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.869
-Hey, let's go.
-Okay.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.913
Watch it!

08:35.599 --> 08:42.104
But it looks like the planet
is a lot madder than we thought.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.196
They call it geostigma.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.745
Well, Marlene? How does it look?

09:00.749 --> 09:06.212
Please. Please don't
take Denzel away.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.597
The commission's report released
this morning has revealed...

09:16.765 --> 09:18.974
...that Lifestream concentration
in the atmosphere...

09:19.142 --> 09:21.268
...has dropped to a mere hundredth
of the levels two years ago...

09:21.436 --> 09:24.939
...and now poses no threat
to the human body.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.941
However, the concentration
remains toxic....

09:27.108 --> 09:30.152
He's not here anymore.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.904
--around the Shinra Company's
main building and mako reactors.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.032
To prevent the onset of geostigma,
the commission does advise...

09:35.200 --> 09:38.827
...that you stay away from these
facilities and the surrounding areas.

09:39.746 --> 09:44.166
Next up: Should Shinra be held
financially responsible for the crisis?

09:46.503 --> 09:50.256
Cloud, where are you?

10:02.519 --> 10:06.981
Hello, Strife Delivery Service.
You name it, we deliv--

10:08.191 --> 10:10.192
May I ask who's calling?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.741
Yeah, l remember you.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.307
You got a call from Reno.
He's in Healen.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.392
Says he's got work for you.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.395
Cloud, how have you been?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.064
You have no more messa--

11:57.967 --> 12:01.804
Hey, Kadaj?
Is that where Big Brother lives?

12:02.889 --> 12:06.892
-Yeah.
-Do you think he'll be glad to see us?

12:07.060 --> 12:10.479
-Not a chance.
-Don't cry, Yazoo.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.148
But Mother's with him?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.485
Maybe not.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.986
Don't cry, Loz.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.620
Hold on, he's coming.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.370
Where's Mother?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.169
We know you hid her, Brother.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.889
Don't tell me you're leading me on?

13:27.056 --> 13:29.892
Because I think you do
have Mother there.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.603
No need to shout.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.607
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.610
Put the president on.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.529
Guess l was the last straw.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.827
What up, fool, it's Barret!
I am the man!

15:11.995 --> 15:16.707
Oil, Cloud! l just found the biggest
damned oil field you ever seen!

15:16.874 --> 15:19.918
Surveying's done, so I should be able
to get out there and see Marlene soon.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.588
You let her know, all right, Spiky?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.926
Reno called again.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.514
He says to hurry,
and he sounded kind of strange....

15:33.182 --> 15:35.183
Be careful, okay?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.048
Okay, so you're good.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.392
Yeah, Rude, looking sharp!

16:25.193 --> 16:28.654
Good. You fight like the SOLDIER
you once claimed to be.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.498
You haven't lost your touch.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.382
Rufus Shinra?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.718
Do I feel sorry for you.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.849
-The day of the explosion...
-What do you want?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.060
-...I managed to get out...
-Who were the guys that attacked me?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.437
-...before it colla--
-l'm leaving.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.942
We need your assistance, Cloud.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.819
-Not interes--
-l acknowledge that Shinra...

17:09.987 --> 17:12.614
...owes the planet a lot.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.117
It goes without saying
that my company and l...

17:16.285 --> 17:19.287
...are the ones who put
the world in the sorry state it's in.

17:19.454 --> 17:23.083
Therefore, it's our responsibility
to set things right.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.459
I'm still out here...?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.712
As a first step...

17:26.878 --> 17:30.465
...we have commenced an
investigation in Sephiroth's wake.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.468
It's been two years.

17:33.636 --> 17:38.724
Now that the world is on its feet again,
what poses the greatest threat?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.561
Well, that one's easy:

17:42.729 --> 17:45.772
Geostigma.

17:45.940 --> 17:51.194
And we have reason to think
Sephiroth is the one responsible.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.949
The populace, they blame
mako energy, and the reactors...

17:56.117 --> 18:00.328
...even the Lifestream
for causing the stigma.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.331
However, isn't that
blame misplaced?

18:03.499 --> 18:06.626
The Lifestream has existed
as long as the planet...

18:06.794 --> 18:11.006
...and even mako energy has been
part of our lives for over 40 years.

18:11.174 --> 18:16.386
And yet, there's no mention
of the stigma in recorded history.

18:17.013 --> 18:22.309
So, what happened during
our time to change all that?

18:22.477 --> 18:25.353
I can think of only one thing.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.355
The arrival of Sephiroth.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.109
-Sephiroth is dead.
-Yes, but has his mind died?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.361
What if he somehow dissolved
into the Lifestream...

18:33.529 --> 18:37.908
...coursing through
the planet undiffused?

18:39.327 --> 18:43.205
I know it is merely my speculation...

18:43.372 --> 18:46.750
...but it is possible, isn't it?

18:46.918 --> 18:50.629
And we can't cure the stigma
until we know the truth.

18:51.464 --> 18:56.676
So we took action. We went
to look for traces of Sephiroth.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.637
We started--

18:59.514 --> 19:01.056
Do you know where?

19:01.224 --> 19:03.600
Yup, at the Northern Cave!

19:03.768 --> 19:06.520
And what do you think we found?

19:06.687 --> 19:11.399
Relax. We didn't find anything.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.238
However, not all went as planned.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.700
We were interrupted.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.454
Get out!

19:35.633 --> 19:37.759
Kadaj and his gang.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.806
-Kadaj?
-They'll be after you as well.

19:42.974 --> 19:46.268
-lf they haven't already found you.
-Leave me out of this.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.687
Don't think you can keep her
from us for long.

19:48.855 --> 19:55.235
How? Your ties to Sephiroth
run as deep as ours do, Cloud.

19:55.403 --> 20:00.532
If Kadaj's purpose is to do what's
necessary to prepare for the moment...

20:00.700 --> 20:03.785
...we stand in the way
as his greatest threat.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.620
"Moment"?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.957
Sephiroth...

20:10.501 --> 20:12.836
-...reborn.
-Are you done talking?

20:13.004 --> 20:15.338
Let's get to the issue at hand.

20:15.506 --> 20:20.719
In order to combat Kadaj, we need
someone with your expertise.

20:20.887 --> 20:26.099
Will you join us?
You're an ex-SOLDIER, Cloud.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.977
That was only in my head.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.318
What's this stuff about "Mother"?

20:36.986 --> 20:41.197
Why, did Kadaj
mention something?

20:41.365 --> 20:45.827
Rufus, if you're hiding something--

20:45.995 --> 20:50.498
I'd never keep a secret,
not from a comrade.

20:51.125 --> 20:55.128
You must want to learn
all you can about the stigma?

20:55.296 --> 20:58.632
Naturally, for the sake
of those orphans you live with.

21:00.176 --> 21:04.429
Surely, you long to see
the smiles return to their faces?

21:04.597 --> 21:10.685
All we want in the end
is to rebuild our world, Cloud.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.988
-But l....
-Come on, Cloud. Think about it.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.699
Together we could rebuild Shinra!

21:26.535 --> 21:28.703
Not interested.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.622
-Reno!
-Reno!

21:53.604 --> 21:56.398
Does Cloud live here?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.733
I guess he does.

22:06.617 --> 22:07.659
What's this?

22:27.096 --> 22:30.724
It's just like Denzel! ls Cloud sick?

22:32.476 --> 22:34.602
Why didn't he say something?

22:34.770 --> 22:36.813
Did he leave because he's sick?

22:36.981 --> 22:39.232
He just wants to fight alone.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.401
-Fight?
-No.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.614
I don't think that he will.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.533
Tifa?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.038
Let's go home, Marlene.

22:54.832 --> 22:58.001
We can't! Cloud's not here yet!

23:01.464 --> 23:03.757
I know, sweetie.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.803
-l miss him too.
-Yeah.

23:08.971 --> 23:12.015
So say he comes back?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.059
We'll all go home!

23:14.226 --> 23:17.645
Not until he gets a lecture.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.898
Uh-huh!

23:22.026 --> 23:25.153
Now we just gotta find Elena
and the director.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.326
-The employees give you any leads?
-No. Nothing yet.

23:36.290 --> 23:41.169
Who'd have thought? A lot of Shinra's
people actually returned to work!

23:41.337 --> 23:45.465
Now that's dedication. l'm telling you,
this could be a fresh start!

23:45.841 --> 23:50.011
Well, those left alive
have a lot to atone for.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.641
Two years already.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.812
Seems like a lot longer than that.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.482
What a nightmare, huh?

24:02.650 --> 24:07.987
The world was nearly obliterated,
and we were the obliterators.

24:10.366 --> 24:14.869
Seriously, though. How are we
ever supposed to atone for that?

24:15.579 --> 24:19.124
Too bad the director's not around,
you know?

24:20.209 --> 24:22.168
Elena too.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.132
Hope they're alive.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.050
They are.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.553
Tseng's just like the president.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.723
They're kind of like cats.
Nine lives, you know.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.059
You got that right!

24:46.068 --> 24:48.444
Found you.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.125
Church?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.880
Oh, l know the one.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.757
I'll be here.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.141
Your call to Sector 7 cannot
be completed at this time.

27:37.072 --> 27:40.533
Cloud, what a surprise.
You never call.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.618
Is something wrong?

27:45.205 --> 27:46.748
Cloud?

27:47.416 --> 27:49.584
No, ma'am.

27:49.752 --> 27:53.755
Well, who, then?
Why do you have Cloud's phone?

27:53.922 --> 27:57.342
-l don't know.
-Who is this?

27:58.761 --> 28:01.095
I don't know. Please....

28:01.263 --> 28:04.932
I don't know what to do.
I can't do this.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.104
Hey, are you crying?

28:18.530 --> 28:22.950
Hello? Are you okay?!
Cloud, if you're there, pick up!

28:31.001 --> 28:32.460
Hey!

28:38.092 --> 28:39.801
You okay?

29:22.845 --> 29:25.138
Boy, do I hate liars.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.641
I apologize.
This time you'll get the truth.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.185
The object you seek
fell from the helicopter...

29:31.353 --> 29:33.104
...while we were running from you.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.107
I'm afraid we were careless.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.651
Is that right?

29:38.819 --> 29:40.695
I swear it.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.866
Fine. Then swear on these.

29:51.415 --> 29:56.335
-Why did you do this?
-We need Mother's power.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.547
The Reunion is coming
and we need her.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.175
Reunion?

30:02.342 --> 30:05.720
My brothers and sisters who share
Mother's cells will all assemble.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.848
And together we'll take revenge
on the planet.

30:09.016 --> 30:13.394
We've already sent out the invitations,
but you know.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.856
Someone's gone and hidden
the guest of honor.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.065
Invitations?

30:18.901 --> 30:23.488
The stigma.
But you know all about that, sir.

30:23.947 --> 30:28.493
Mother's memetic legacy lives on in
the Lifestream and makes it happen.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.246
She does so much for us, and we....

30:32.414 --> 30:35.583
We don't even know
where to find her.

30:36.251 --> 30:40.087
But what can we do,
we're just Remnants.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.924
Merely remnants of Mother's legacy.

30:43.091 --> 30:48.179
Until we find Mother and receive
her cells, we can't be whole again.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.933
Geostigma and a legacy
aren't enough.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.144
Not for a true Reunion.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.604
What do you mean?

30:58.607 --> 31:03.569
But, sir, surely you've noticed?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.524
Jeez, sorry about that.

31:44.820 --> 31:45.861
The stigma!

31:51.868 --> 31:54.579
Can't you people just stay indoors?!

32:08.260 --> 32:09.302
Here.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.043
I said l'd live out both our lives.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.255
Easy to make that promise.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.175
So you wanna be in SOLDIER?
Hang in there.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.218
Hey, you doing okay?

32:51.386 --> 32:54.889
Well, what are you gonna do
once we get to Midgar?

32:55.057 --> 32:57.391
We're friends, right?

33:05.317 --> 33:07.485
Pops, park us over by the rocks!

33:07.653 --> 33:09.820
Cloud, ride's over!

33:13.075 --> 33:14.950
My honor, my dreams...

33:17.079 --> 33:21.332
...they're yours now.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.378
You'll be my living legacy.

33:27.964 --> 33:31.926
I swore that l would never forget.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.136
I tried.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.222
But l....

33:43.105 --> 33:45.606
Don't pretend you're sad.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.653
Why tremble with anger
that's not even there?

33:51.530 --> 33:54.907
Face it, Cloud.

33:55.075 --> 33:59.370
All you are is an empty puppet.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.149
Wanna play?

34:31.527 --> 34:33.904
I guess that's a no.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.992
Where's Mother?

34:45.667 --> 34:46.708
Gross.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.255
-Hey, where's Mother?
-There's no one here!

34:53.675 --> 34:56.177
Fine. Play with me.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.817
This'll be fun.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.728
Tifa!

36:57.841 --> 36:59.800
She's not here.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.470
I'm not crying!

37:04.973 --> 37:07.641
No, I got it. I'll bring the girl.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.356
Where were we?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.375
Cloud....

38:15.043 --> 38:16.877
Just run!

38:34.229 --> 38:37.231
Sorry about before.

38:38.733 --> 38:39.900
Thank you.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.656
Sure.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.119
My little brother....

38:51.955 --> 38:53.998
Well, he's gone.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.584
I see.

38:58.378 --> 39:01.880
Hey, I know you've got it too.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.800
Come on, they'll fix us.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.771
Tifa?

40:00.774 --> 40:02.274
Tifa!

40:08.907 --> 40:10.115
You're late....

40:10.450 --> 40:12.201
Who did this?

40:14.204 --> 40:16.330
He didn't say.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.333
Marlene?!

40:27.634 --> 40:29.593
Damn!

41:38.955 --> 41:41.456
You know, you're pretty heavy.

41:41.624 --> 41:45.294
Weren't there some kids
living with you?

41:45.461 --> 41:47.087
Because they ain't here.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.759
You don't care?

41:56.097 --> 41:58.015
I just....

42:07.942 --> 42:09.526
You're a real handful.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.126
Tifa said to take you home, kid.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.963
Grab on.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.042
So who's gonna fix us?

43:09.963 --> 43:11.004
I don't know.

43:15.635 --> 43:17.678
Whatever. Like it matters anymore.

43:36.364 --> 43:39.408
Look at what Brother was hiding.

43:41.286 --> 43:44.997
Powers forged in the Lifestream.

43:47.417 --> 43:52.379
With this materia,
those powers will be ours.

43:55.091 --> 43:58.468
So those are a gift from Mother?

43:58.636 --> 44:00.721
Yeah, gotta be.

44:01.264 --> 44:04.182
Then Brother's hiding Mother too?

44:04.350 --> 44:07.227
No, it's that Shinra guy.

44:07.395 --> 44:12.357
Keeping her hidden is something
they've always been very good at.

44:12.942 --> 44:14.985
Then all we gotta do
is check everywhere...

44:15.153 --> 44:17.070
...that's got anything
to do with Shinra.

44:18.740 --> 44:22.075
But we'll have plenty of help soon.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.786
Boy, l can't wait.

44:26.581 --> 44:32.169
But first,
we need a word with Brother.

44:32.337 --> 44:35.922
He likes to pretend
he's not part of the family.

44:36.424 --> 44:39.676
How he breaks my heart.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.102
Yeah.

45:09.624 --> 45:11.792
Reno and Rude are out looking.

45:16.923 --> 45:21.259
You have geostigma, don't you?

45:22.053 --> 45:25.722
You're gonna give up and die.
Is that it?

45:30.436 --> 45:32.229
So it is.

45:32.814 --> 45:34.731
There's no cure.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.818
Yeah, but that's not
stopping Denzel, is it?

45:38.444 --> 45:40.487
Don't run. Let's fight it together.

45:40.655 --> 45:43.824
We can help each other,
I know we can.

45:47.203 --> 45:50.288
I guess that only works
for real families.

45:50.456 --> 45:52.207
Tifa...

45:53.334 --> 45:56.253
...l'm not fit to help anyone.

45:56.671 --> 46:00.173
Not my family, not my friends.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.092
Nobody.

46:04.971 --> 46:14.521
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally....

46:14.689 --> 46:17.315
I think she wants you
to move on, man.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.651
Did you find them?

46:19.819 --> 46:22.028
No, only a witness.

46:22.196 --> 46:24.865
Kadaj's gang took the kids.

46:25.032 --> 46:28.743
-Where are they?
-They're at their base now.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.830
The Forgotten City.

46:44.260 --> 46:49.055
Mother has given me
a very special gift:

46:49.390 --> 46:51.892
The power to fight...

46:52.393 --> 46:54.728
...against a planet
that torments humanity!

46:58.107 --> 47:02.736
She gave this gift to all her children.

47:02.904 --> 47:04.571
That's right.

47:05.323 --> 47:08.241
You and I are brethren.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.368
Brothers and sisters chosen...

47:10.536 --> 47:14.915
...when we inherited Mother's memetic
legacy through the Lifestream.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.834
But...

47:19.086 --> 47:22.422
...the planet doesn't
approve of that at all.

47:22.924 --> 47:26.718
It's doing everything it can
to hold us back.

47:27.094 --> 47:32.766
That's why it's racking our bodies with
pain and filling our hearts with doubt!

47:35.061 --> 47:36.978
Now I shall heal you.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.398
And we will go to Mother together!

47:40.691 --> 47:45.195
We will join as a family
and strike back at the planet!

47:50.034 --> 47:52.327
Do as l do.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.750
Denzel.

48:44.505 --> 48:45.839
Denzel!

48:57.852 --> 48:59.936
See, Mother?

49:00.187 --> 49:03.648
All my new brothers and sisters!

49:04.734 --> 49:09.779
They can keep me company,
just until I find you.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.403
You came.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.241
Even though you're about to break.

49:56.661 --> 49:59.079
That's a good sign.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.706
So...

50:02.541 --> 50:05.168
...why did you come?

50:06.754 --> 50:10.882
I think I want to be forgiven.

50:11.592 --> 50:15.095
Yeah. More than anything.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.222
By who?

51:07.314 --> 51:10.024
-l'm glad you could make it.
-l only came for the kids.

51:10.359 --> 51:13.903
See this man? He's our big brother.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.322
But alas...

51:17.032 --> 51:19.451
...in our happy flock...

51:20.661 --> 51:22.662
...he's what you'd call
a black sheep.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.167
Cloud!

53:46.891 --> 53:49.726
See, l knew l'd be no help.

53:50.644 --> 53:53.521
Vincent. What do you know
about this?

53:55.566 --> 53:57.358
I come here often.

53:59.862 --> 54:02.322
I've seen what Kadaj's group
is doing.

54:04.158 --> 54:06.117
The stigma.

54:06.285 --> 54:08.870
It's a symptom of alien matter
infesting the body.

54:09.038 --> 54:11.789
The body tries to eliminate it
and overcompensates.

54:14.001 --> 54:18.004
Inside our bodies is a current,
like the Lifestream.

54:18.172 --> 54:21.090
That current is what fights off
any malevolent intruders.

54:23.636 --> 54:25.595
What do you mean by "intruder"?

54:26.013 --> 54:29.974
The Sephiroth gene.
Jenova's memetic legacy.

54:30.309 --> 54:31.351
Call it what you want.

54:33.812 --> 54:34.896
You're well-informed.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.857
Tseng and Elena.

54:38.025 --> 54:41.194
They were brought here half-dead.

54:41.362 --> 54:44.155
They must have been
brutally tortured.

54:44.990 --> 54:47.867
I did what I could
to save them, but....

54:48.035 --> 54:50.286
Well, we'll see.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.372
Tortured?

54:52.539 --> 54:53.957
They had it coming.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.292
They got their hands
on Jenova's head.

54:57.169 --> 55:00.088
Then when Kadaj says
he's looking for "Mother"....

55:00.255 --> 55:04.717
Heaven's dark harbinger.
The calamity, Jenova.

55:05.052 --> 55:08.388
If they wanted to,
they could re-create Sephiroth.

55:09.890 --> 55:11.391
Kadaj....

55:11.892 --> 55:13.768
What is he?

55:14.728 --> 55:16.729
I'd rather not know.

55:27.908 --> 55:28.908
Marlene!

55:29.076 --> 55:31.244
Cloud! Denzel and Tifa!

55:31.412 --> 55:32.870
Tifa is all right.

55:33.038 --> 55:35.248
I wanna talk to her!

55:40.337 --> 55:42.171
May I?

55:43.465 --> 55:45.633
You don't have a phone?

55:47.261 --> 55:50.096
Vincent, will you bring
Marlene to Tifa?

55:50.889 --> 55:53.016
I'm gonna go see Shinra
and get a few answers.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.852
-l can't do that.
-But l--

55:56.020 --> 55:57.103
Forget it, Cloud!

55:57.271 --> 56:01.107
Why don't you ever pay
any attention to us?

56:04.111 --> 56:07.447
Marlene, please give me some time.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.782
There's a battle to be fought...

56:09.950 --> 56:12.535
...but it's not as simple
as just fighting it. Understand?

56:12.953 --> 56:14.412
No, I don't!

56:14.580 --> 56:18.624
Cloud, you sure
this is about fighting?

56:19.835 --> 56:20.918
Where are they?

56:21.086 --> 56:23.296
They're at their base now.

56:24.131 --> 56:25.673
The Forgotten City.

56:28.927 --> 56:30.553
Go.

56:36.810 --> 56:39.979
-l have to talk to Rufus.
-Stop running!

56:40.689 --> 56:41.773
I know.

56:41.940 --> 56:44.484
Even if you find the kids,
you might not be able to help them.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.111
Maybe something will happen
that can never unhappen.

56:47.279 --> 56:48.946
That scares you, doesn't it?

56:49.114 --> 56:51.324
But you need to really
think about now.

56:51.492 --> 56:54.077
Look at you! You think
you've got it so damn hard.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.746
Well, you hate being alone,
so let people in!

56:57.081 --> 56:59.248
Sure, you might not
answer the phone...

56:59.416 --> 57:01.793
...but l don't see you
throwing it away either!

57:05.005 --> 57:08.800
You go. The base is all yours.

57:16.225 --> 57:17.391
Which is it?

57:19.311 --> 57:21.395
A memory, or us?

57:26.652 --> 57:30.571
But I let you die.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.908
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally.

57:34.076 --> 57:37.787
Isn't it time you did the forgiving?

57:40.541 --> 57:43.793
Are sins ever forgiven?

57:44.169 --> 57:45.419
I've never tried.

57:45.921 --> 57:47.547
You mean....

57:47.923 --> 57:49.048
Never tried....

57:54.179 --> 57:56.597
Marlene, let's go.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.061
Well, l'm gonna try.

58:02.229 --> 58:04.272
I'll phone in the verdict.

58:23.709 --> 58:26.085
lt's me, Reeve.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.588
How's work going?

58:28.755 --> 58:32.049
I saw your flyer. How in the world
do you stay in business?

58:32.217 --> 58:34.719
You never change, Cloud.

58:34.887 --> 58:38.431
I was thinking about helping you out,
but I guess l'll call back another time.

58:38.599 --> 58:40.391
-Goodbye for now.
-Surprise! lt's me, Yuffie.

58:40.559 --> 58:43.561
So, hey, all the kids are suddenly
missing from Wutai. Weird.

58:43.729 --> 58:47.773
Have you heard anything about it?
Give me a ring and fill me in, okay?

58:53.030 --> 58:57.491
I never blamed you, not once.

58:57.659 --> 59:01.787
You came for me.
That's all that matters.

59:41.161 --> 59:44.372
-Hey, you listening?
-What have you done with these kids?

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.214
Denzel!

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.972
Denzel! Denzel!

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.578
And what are we up to?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.464
We know. Mother is here.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.257
Oh, yeah?

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.217
Yeah, this thing....

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.597
Monument thing? Shinra made it.

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:27.308
So you think we hid her here?

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.603
-Did you?
-Why ask us?

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.939
Where we hid her is classified info.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.987
Seems you do have
something to hide.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.578
Rude, you and your big mouth!

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.181
Does it hurt?

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.480
A bit. But not as bad as Denzel's.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.483
Is there a cure?

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.277
I don't know.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.030
After all you did.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:26.784
You've been trying so hard
to find a cure for Denzel.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.412
You knew about that?

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:33.791
Cloud, you should clean off
your desk once in a while.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.502
Maybe I should.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:42.842
So is that why? Is that the reason
why you had to leave, Cloud?

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.845
Because you couldn't fix Denzel?

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:49.014
Or because you have
the sickness too?

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.687
I just thought
I couldn't care for myself.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.023
Let alone anyone else.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.110
How you supposed
to look after your family...

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.612
...if you can't even
look after yourself?

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:08.409
Or at least Daddy says so.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.454
Cloud, don't give up.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:20.838
In the past, you've always looked
after me. You and Denzel and Tifa.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:24.091
You were there whenever
I needed you.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.888
Well, now it's my turn.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:43.652
Say, Kadaj.
I've got a question for you.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.906
I've got an answer.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:53.078
You told me that you needed Jenova
cells in order to be whole again, right?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.706
What did you mean by that?

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:01.462
Him. He's coming back.

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.132
Sephiroth.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.550
The nightmare.

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:07.927
So they say.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.470
You mean....

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:12.097
I've never known Sephiroth.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:16.227
I just.... I sense him there.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.021
It's unbearable...

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.942
...to think Mother might want
Sephiroth more than....

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.485
Poor little Remnant.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:29.323
It doesn't matter who she picks!
You'll all meet the same end!

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.786
Mother came to this planet
after a long journey.

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:37.581
To rid the cosmos of fools like you!

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:41.627
But you know as well as I do...

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.424
...nothing's changed
since she got here.

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:50.135
I have to change it.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.222
To make her happy!

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:57.142
If Mother willed it,
I'd do anything for her!

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.270
The nightmare returns.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:05.859
As long as you exist, the nightmares
will come again and again.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.739
The Lifestream courses
through our world...

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.743
...ever flowing between
the edge of life and death.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:18.080
If that cycle is the very truth of life...

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.834
...then history, too,
will inevitably repeat itself.

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:24.837
Go on, bring your Jenovas
and your Sephiroths.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:28.173
Cause trouble
till your heart's content.

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.343
We'll do as life mandates,
we promise.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:36.181
We won't let you win and stop you.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:42.980
Please, sir, is that your excuse
for going after Mother yourself?

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.649
You don't seem all that sorry.

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.860
Sorry?

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:51.196
The truth is, l actually enjoy it.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:06:03.125
Good. Then let's put
an end to all this.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.693
Denzel, we've got to get away!

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.909
-Hello....
-Hell, no.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.359
Is it after us?

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.236
I'm not looking!

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:16.068
Are we having fun yet?

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:17.569
The time of my life.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.328
When are you gonna call it a day!?

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:29.872
What?

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:33.752
Just as soon as you give back Mother,
that'll be the end of everything.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:41.760
Punks.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.680
What do you need
Jenova's head for?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.570
Forget your little Reunion
and get a grip!

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:03.156
All we want is to be with Mother!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:12.624
Mother will know. When she gets here,
she'll decide what's best.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.878
Now, where's Mother?

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:33.937
Mother, shmother.
It's Jenova's frigging head!

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:36.982
-Hey!
-Don't refer to Mother that way.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.442
You meanie!

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.822
Our apologies.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.616
Your ma's cool--

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.159
What the hell am l saying?!

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.710
Tifa?

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.133
Son of a bitch!

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.065
You look after Momma.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.400
Barret!

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.486
Marlene better be safe, huh?

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.586
We can handle this!

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.746
So who's been touching
my materia?

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.414
The bad guys, naturally.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.583
Ooh!

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:02.127
Who's that?

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.674
She's a beaut!

01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:09.468
My Shera, the latest model!

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:12.804
I'll give you the grand tour
afterward!

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.307
Where can I buy a phone?

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:21.146
-Who's he?
-They're our friends.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.358
Denzel, can you make it to the bar?

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:54.971
Enough!

01:13:58.184 --> 01:13:59.726
Tifa!

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.024
Denzel!

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.381
Cloud!

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.227
Sorry that it took me so long.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.229
It's all right.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:53.071
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.409
Marlene will be safe.
I took her home.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.581
I feel lighter.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:09.754
Maybe I lost some weight.
All that dilly-dallying.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.471
I'm gonna go back to see Marlene,
okay, Cloud? We'll wait for you!

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:24.603
Hey, Cloud. See you there, right?

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:07.145
I gotta do this!

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.102
The hell you been?

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.794
This is too fun, sir!

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:20.171
Any requests for the next act?

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:33.184
-Mother?
-A good son would have known.

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:48.199
Alley-oop!

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.545
Giddyap!

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:09.179
There you go!

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.402
Fly!

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:34.746
No giving up!

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.244
Ready?

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:06.629
Mother!

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:15.680
-Sir, no!
-Sir, no!

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:01.517
Sir.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.576
You losers are chasing
the wrong guy!

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.047
Rude!

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:51.103
No, no, no! Don't do this to me!

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:55.441
Hey, Rude! You're all right!

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:58.653
Yeah. l'm just peachy.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:31.143
Hey, guys!

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.717
Hey, partner.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:31.013
This thing got any bite to it?

01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:34.558
Shinra technology at its finest.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.686
Oh, so you made this.

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:39.897
If nothing else, it's flashy.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.983
Oh, good.

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.944
You love it. l know.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.863
Looks like today
we're clocking out early.

01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:21.957
Mother!

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:08.314
Let's go, Cloud.

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:40.221
Brother. I'm with her at last.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.098
So, what's gonna happen now?

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.353
Mother's going to tell me.

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:52.942
I guess a Remnant
wouldn't really know.

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:59.031
So what if I'm a puppet?

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:05.663
Once upon a time...

01:33:07.624 --> 01:33:09.500
...you were too!

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.486
Cloud, l brought you materia!

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.323
-Hey, watch it!
-Yo, Cid! Park this turkey!

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:43.826
Shut up! You want off?
Then jump! Get off my back!

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:45.995
He can handle this alone.

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:50.708
Kadaj is a Remnant of Sephiroth.

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:53.502
Think of him as
a sort of larval form.

01:33:54.004 --> 01:33:56.297
Larva? You mean he's an insect!

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.007
Lassie, shut your gob.

01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.509
So the punk's gonna
become Sephiroth.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:04.513
Vincent, does Cloud
know about Kadaj?

01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:06.724
One would think.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.892
Then you're right.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:11.603
It's his fight now.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:14.565
Why, l don't get it?
Why can't we help out!?

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:16.066
This is man talk.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:18.027
Sexist! Sexist!

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:20.404
Crikey, lass, shut yer mooth!

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:22.281
The men don't get it either.

01:34:22.449 --> 01:34:24.074
Two years ago...

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:29.580
...think of the strength we all had
when we fought that last battle.

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:31.832
It's only been a couple years...

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.084
...but already that feeling is gone.

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:38.172
But Cloud,
I think he's found it again.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.924
He's got 1 0 minutes.

01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:44.136
That Cloud's a royal pain
in the ass, like always.

01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:47.181
Cloud is Cloud.

01:36:02.674 --> 01:36:06.844
My Reunion.
Bet you're dying to watch.

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:30.868
Good to see you, Cloud.

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:47.926
Your geostigma is gone?

01:36:49.888 --> 01:36:51.472
That's too bad.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.849
Sephiroth, what do you want?

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:58.479
The last thoughts
of geostigma's dead.

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:01.982
Those Remnants will join the
Lifestream and girdle the planet...

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:05.694
...choking it, corroding it.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:09.114
What l want, Cloud...

01:37:09.282 --> 01:37:13.869
...is to sail the darkness of the cosmos
with this planet as my vessel...

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.998
...just as my mother did long ago.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:28.175
Then one day we'll find
a new planet...

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:31.178
...and on its soil we'll create
a shining future.

01:37:31.846 --> 01:37:33.222
What about this planet?

01:37:33.765 --> 01:37:37.518
Well, that's up to you.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.123
Is it her?

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.964
Where did you find this strength?

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.842
I'm not about to tell you!

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:29.713
I've thought of
a wonderful present for you.

01:39:36.137 --> 01:39:38.055
Shall l give you despair?

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:52.402
On your knees!
I want you to beg for forgiveness.

01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:47.476
Is this the pain
you felt before, Cloud?

01:41:48.895 --> 01:41:50.479
Let me remind you.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:53.899
This time, you won't forget.

01:42:20.384 --> 01:42:23.345
Tell me what you cherish most.

01:42:24.806 --> 01:42:27.808
Give me the pleasure
of taking it away?

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:36.858
So what if it looks hopeless?

01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:40.028
If it were me, l still wouldn't give up.

01:42:42.949 --> 01:42:45.033
Embrace your dreams.

01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:49.621
And, whatever happens,
protect your honor as SOLDlER!

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:52.582
Well, okay,
you never made SOLDIER.

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:55.085
But it's what's in here that counts.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.629
Zack?

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:01.675
Well? You need a hand with him?

01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:10.767
You already beat him once,
didn't you?

01:43:10.935 --> 01:43:14.521
-This should be a cinch.
-Yeah.

01:43:16.858 --> 01:43:20.235
Cloud. You know what l told you.

01:43:20.987 --> 01:43:22.571
That's right.

01:43:23.406 --> 01:43:25.949
I am your living legacy.

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:36.877
I pity you. You just don't get it at all.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:40.672
There's not a thing l don't cherish!

01:44:17.293 --> 01:44:21.171
Stay where you belong.
In my memories.

01:44:26.886 --> 01:44:32.140
I will never be a memory.

01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:04.214
Brother....

01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:08.218
Kadaj?

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:26.069
You don't have to hang on
any longer.

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:33.910
Mother, is that...?

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:38.248
Everyone's waiting, if you're ready.

01:46:28.132 --> 01:46:30.133
We're cured!

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:05.293
-Oh, yeah, we rock!
-See, what'd l tell you fools?

01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:07.712
That's my boy, Cloud!
You're the chips and gravy.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.756
A little push is what he needs,
that's all!

01:47:09.924 --> 01:47:12.550
Y'all calm down,
hang on to your britches!

01:47:21.102 --> 01:47:25.396
Somehow l knew you were there.

01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:28.024
Thank you.

01:48:08.899 --> 01:48:12.068
We'll go together....

01:48:16.991 --> 01:48:20.034
Together, we'll play....

01:48:46.061 --> 01:48:47.604
Cloud!

01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:56.779
He'll come back.
He said that he would.

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:21.137
Let's go!

01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:47.223
Mother?

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:53.730
Again? Why is everyone
calling me their mother lately?

01:50:55.524 --> 01:50:58.943
I guess they must be fond of you.

01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:02.113
This one's a little too big to adopt.

01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:08.661
Tough luck, friend. Sounds like
you don't have a place here.

01:52:05.886 --> 01:52:09.806
It's like she said: "Wait here
and Cloud will come back."

01:52:12.101 --> 01:52:14.268
Welcome back!

01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:26.114
I'm back.

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:31.661
There are still children
with the stigma.

01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.247
Yeah.

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:44.298
Hey, let's get you fixed up.

01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:48.678
Come on, l'm here.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.014
It's okay.

01:53:44.443 --> 01:53:47.945
-Last one in is a rotten egg!
-lt's working!

01:54:35.661 --> 01:54:39.997
You see? Everything's all right.

01:55:00.394 --> 01:55:02.061
I know.

01:55:03.939 --> 01:55:05.982
I'm not alone.

01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:09.360
Not anymore.

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:02.971
Is this somebody's grave?

02:06:04.557 --> 02:06:06.433
No.

02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:10.854
This is where a hero
began his journey.
