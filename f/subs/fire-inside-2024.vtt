25:12.428 --> 25:13.804
He used to touch me.

He used to touch me like that.

Uh-huh. We went down there
and got it.

great, Jason. Thank you.

taken care of as well.

to go to China.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.463
I'm sorry, Claressa.

Jason's not sanctioned
with AIBA,

I'm so sorry, Claressa.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.147
We can only travel in
officially-sanctioned coaches.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.275
Jason would have to

30:59.358 --> 31:00.734
fly himself there,
and even then

31:00.818 --> 31:02.319
it would only be
to support from the sidelines.

is excellent.

no more shifts.

Don't start cryin' on me.

Don't go cryin' on me now.

is tears of joy, right?

you go over there,

cryin' like a little bitch.

I ain't there...

with body blows.

Some sensational
combinations here.

That's it, that's it.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.673
There you see,
again with the left hand.

There you go, Ressa! Come on!

That's it, that's how we do.
That's how we do.

Here comes Shields again!

Right there!
Right there, that's it!

32:54.223 --> 32:56.350
Rani, nowhere to go, flailing.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.352
She can't escape
that thrashing from Shields.

That's quite a debut
out there. Really impressive.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.120
Pooja Rani
didn't stand a chance.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.663
Is that why
they call you T-Rex?

33:17.746 --> 33:19.957
No, that's account of
my short arms, actually.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.041
I ain't got reach,

33:21.125 --> 33:22.626
but I'm as fierce
as they come.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.545
Well, that's
clearly the truth.

So, Claressa, tell me.
Why boxing?

Excuse me. I'm just gonna
borrow Claressa for a moment.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.521
You might wanna
rethink your strategy.

33:43.439 --> 33:44.815
What you mean?

33:44.898 --> 33:48.152
People expect female athletes
to behave a certain way,

33:48.235 --> 33:49.278
look a certain way.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.196

-That's bullshit.
-It sucks, I know.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.616
But the reality is,

33:54.700 --> 33:55.743
if you wanna succeed
outside the ring,

33:55.826 --> 33:57.327
you gotta play the game.

Man, I can beat that girl ass.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.804
I'm a way better
boxer than her.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.014
Well, that remains to be seen,

34:18.098 --> 34:20.100
but that is exactly my point.

34:20.184 --> 34:21.935
It's not fair, but for women,

34:22.018 --> 34:24.605
it's not just about
how skilled you are.

worried about her, though.

Boxing Championships

35:48.021 --> 35:50.190
The top eight finishers
here at Worlds

35:50.274 --> 35:53.360
will qualify to move on to
the Summer Olympics in London.

35:53.443 --> 35:54.820
That's right.

And Flint, Michigan's
17-year-old Claressa Shields

can punch her ticket to London
right now

35:59.449 --> 36:01.743
with a victory
in this semifinal match

against England's
Savannah Marshall.

here yesterday

36:06.456 --> 36:08.250
with India's Pooja Rani.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.836
But Marshall is a much
more seasoned fighter.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.591
All right. Now, she has
a reach advantage

36:15.674 --> 36:17.926
so you let her come at you,
and you counter, okay?

36:18.010 --> 36:19.303
Wait, huh?

36:19.386 --> 36:21.054
When she punches,
I need you to counter

36:21.138 --> 36:22.347
and then give her the slip.

[female announcer]
Claressa Shields

37:09.937 --> 37:11.188
not on her usual game tonight.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.356
-What's goin' on, little man?
-She can't seem

37:12.439 --> 37:13.357

37:14.524 --> 37:15.817

37:18.236 --> 37:19.655
Dominating with
her long reach.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.697
She just need a minute
to figure it out, that's all.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.157
They gonna get her right
when she get back

37:22.240 --> 37:23.325
-to her corner.
-In the first round,

37:23.408 --> 37:24.534
we're tied
at two points apiece.

37:24.618 --> 37:25.744
Calm down.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.412
-You listen to me now.
-Bruh, she keep runnin'!

37:27.496 --> 37:28.830
-[female coach] I know!
-She ain't even comin' at me!

37:28.914 --> 37:30.916
Calm down, Claressa. I need
you to listen to me, now.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.042
-What I need to do?
-Look!

37:32.125 --> 37:33.251
When she step to throw,

37:33.335 --> 37:35.003
and I know she
way out there, Claressa,

37:35.087 --> 37:36.463
-but when she step...
-[voice distorts]

37:36.546 --> 37:37.339
I need you to give her
the slip to the left

37:37.422 --> 37:39.007
-like we talked about.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.450
Close her down!
Don't give her the reach.

Move with her.
Close that space.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.671

all over for you.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.038
It's Jason.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.290
I don't wanna talk to him.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.962
Uh, Jason, I'm not sure
if you're aware

38:59.046 --> 39:00.172
from the coverage over there,

39:00.255 --> 39:02.966
but Claressa's
not out just yet.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.385
If Savannah Marshall wins
the tournament tomorrow

39:05.469 --> 39:07.929
it'll weigh Claressa's
strength of competition.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.097
And that, along with

39:09.181 --> 39:10.599
her impressive score
from round one,

39:10.682 --> 39:13.852
should be enough for the final
seed into the Olympics.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.896
Think of it like
a wild-card spot in football.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.981
Yeah, that's good.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.941
That's good. That gives us
somethin' to hope for.

39:21.318 --> 39:23.570

Ressa. Aye, Ressa?

39:24.404 --> 39:26.323
I know it's a loss,

39:26.406 --> 39:27.949
but that's your first loss.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.410
You know, it happened already.
That loss is done.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.081
But this a new day.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.248
Yeah? This a new day.

39:35.332 --> 39:37.042
It's time for you
to get back up.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.252
See, this ain't
no physical thing.

39:39.336 --> 39:40.378
About what's in your head,

39:40.462 --> 39:41.797
what's in your soul,
what's in your spirit.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.673
Now, if you stay down,
then you down,

39:43.757 --> 39:45.884
that's your character,
but you get back up...

39:47.135 --> 39:48.428
you know, you the truth.

39:50.764 --> 39:51.848
So it's gonna be up to you

39:51.932 --> 39:53.809
to show who Claressa Shields
really is.

Good luck, Savannah!

40:50.115 --> 40:53.368
[teacher] I want your papers
to focus on one of three

40:53.451 --> 40:56.621

-Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.554
[Jason] How many times
you gonna watch that?

41:15.432 --> 41:17.475
How many times? Hmm?

41:24.983 --> 41:26.276
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.236
[Jason] You fine? Aight.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.155
You sure about that?

41:30.238 --> 41:31.323
I don't feel like talkin'.

41:32.657 --> 41:33.825
Well, you need to.

41:35.911 --> 41:38.580
You can't keep watchin' that
fight over and over again,

41:38.663 --> 41:39.706
hatin' on everything.

41:39.789 --> 41:40.874
You need to let it out.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.419

41:44.502 --> 41:46.421
-I hear you, man! Dang!
-[Jason] Don't ignore me then.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.589
Jason, why you bothering her?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.216
I don't like
when people ignore me.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.717
-She don't feel like talkin'.
-You just keep flyin' at me!

41:50.800 --> 41:52.385
You keep flyin' at me
and I keep tellin' you,

41:52.469 --> 41:53.887
I don't feel like talkin'
about the stupid fight.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.222
I lost.

41:55.305 --> 41:56.932
I lost, and I'mma try
to do better next time

41:57.015 --> 41:58.183
and it's just like,
it's not enough.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.768
Even when I win,
it's not enough.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.728
You told me you was gonna be
there, and you weren't there.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.647
Oh, okay, so now she
blamin' me, right? Okay.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.607
-Can't blame nobody else.
-Oh, you can't, huh?

42:05.690 --> 42:07.817
-Jason.
-[knock at door]

If it's a girl,
I'mma name her Miracle.

dress her all cute

Of course I'm sure.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.049
What kinda question that is?

42:31.132 --> 42:33.510
Ain't like I'm some dude
that can claim it ain't mine.

42:35.011 --> 42:37.180
You talk to baby daddy yet?

42:41.393 --> 42:42.936
Shit, Bri.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.107
Where you gonna stay?
You can't stay at Mama's.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.027
Well, when you
win that prize money,

42:51.111 --> 42:52.112
we could get our own place.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.739
Just us.

Yeah, well...

[Jason] 20, 40, 60.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.409
All right, $860.

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:52.702
That's not bad.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:58.708
-What's this?
-That's your share. 430.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.085
What?

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:02.170
Nah, man, you my agent.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.421
10% is what you get.

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:05.715
10%? [laughs] Okay.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:07.133
[Claressa] Yeah,
everybody know that.

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:08.718
[Jason] Oh, yeah?
You know I'm more

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:10.678
than just your agent,
right, Hollywood?

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:14.140
Your publicist, lawyer.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:15.308
Hell, I'm your life coach.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.476
Start actin' like it, then.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:17.852
-"Start actin' like it"?
-Yeah, start actin' like it.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.312
You know how much
I had to pay them printers?

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.438
I'm losing money on your ass.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.192
Hey, listen,
$430 is all you get,

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:25.819
period, point blank,
you hear me?

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.529
All right, then,
take your ass to court.

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:29.948
"Take my ass to court"? Okay.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.491
-For $400?
-Yep.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.576
Better go on somewhere
with that.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.453
Talkin' 10%,
what's wrong with you?

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:43.962
Come on, bruh, not today.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.854
There we go. Look at that!

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:04.440
[laughs] That's it.
Don't get tired!

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:05.733
I know you ain't tired!

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:08.194
[laughing] That's it.
That's it. Come on.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.447
Yeah! You 40 minutes late!

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:15.076
All right, crunches, crunches.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.911
-[whistle blows]
-One!

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:19.789
Two! All the way up.

01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:20.915
Bean, take over.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:23.835
Three!

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.088
Four!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:29.841
Five!

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.593
What you doing?

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.345
Waiting on you.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:35.930
You know what to do.
Work the bag.

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:39.934
We need to get you back
on your routine,

01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:41.519
start eating right,
putting in that work.

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:42.520
What's the point?

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:43.688
Excuse me?

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.648
What's the point?

01:14:45.732 --> 01:14:48.401
We already won the gold medal.
What are we working for now?

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:53.406
When I tell you
to do something,

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:55.283
you do it.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.538
Work the bag, Ress.

01:15:13.301 --> 01:15:14.510
What, you forget how to count?

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:16.095
13!

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.182
14!

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.100
-[whistle blows]
-[Jason] Fast feet, let's go.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.107
[exhaling forcefully]

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:34.822
[melancholy music playing]

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:10.066
[Jason] Uh, Claressa's only
the second American

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:13.361
to win a gold medal in boxing
since 1988.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:15.154
And she's
the first woman in America

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:17.699
to win a gold medal
in boxing... period.

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:20.910
And she's only 17 years old.

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:23.913
And look, I did
a little research and, uh,

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.291
you don't have that many women
in your portfolio, so...

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:28.084
[chuckles]

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.670
Now, you put her in some of
your commercials and your ads.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:32.505
I mean,
people are gonna love her.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:33.715
People are gonna love her.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:35.550
You don't have to sell me
on any of this.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.343
I've watched Claressa
in London.

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:38.761
Watched every fight.

01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:40.930
-[laughing] All right.
-You have a fan right here.

01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:42.307
All right! All right.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:45.268
What Claressa has accomplished
is phenomenal.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.603
Hey, and kudos to you, man.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.022
For finding her,
for training her,

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.690
you deserve a lot of credit.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.275
No, you do. You do.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.610
Thank you, thank you.
I appreciate that.

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:56.321
I appreciate that.

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:57.780
I would love
to represent Claressa.

01:16:57.864 --> 01:16:59.157
I genuinely would.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.785
[laughing] All right!
Man! All right.

01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:04.454
I do have to
level with you, though.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:09.375
It's just much harder
with women athletes.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:11.252
Then you amplify that
when they excel in a sport

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:13.921
that people don't expect
to see women in.

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:15.006
Like boxing.

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:17.425
Like boxing.

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:22.221
Look, it's difficult enough
with soccer

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:23.765
and basketball, but...

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:25.808
It's just,
people don't like seeing

01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:27.101
their sisters or daughters,

01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:29.437
or hell, even some moms
get punched in the face.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.855
[Jason chuckles dryly]

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:33.399
You know, people wanna see
beach volleyball,

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:36.527
women in bikinis
diving in the sand.

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:38.321
Hey, I want Claressa
front and center

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.156
just as much as you do.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:43.201
It's just that this industry,
for women in boxing,

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:44.410
there's no money.

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.498
Look, I'm really sorry, Jason.

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:10.061
[Nicole] Before Jason
gets here,

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:12.188
there's something
we wanna discuss with you.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.648
How would you feel
about coming out

01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:15.691
to Colorado after graduation?

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:19.570
You could work with USA
Boxing team to train for 2016.

01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:22.698
Full access to
all the facilities, our staff.

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:25.076
We could talk about getting
you your own apartment.

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:27.912
It seems like a change
might do you good.

01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:31.374
I mean,
can my family come, too?

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.751
Bri just had a baby,
and my ma on disability.

01:18:33.835 --> 01:18:35.336
I'm sorry, no, the facilities

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.256
are for
our Olympic athletes only.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:41.217
I can't leave them.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.928
Peanut been getting in trouble
in school lately, and,

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.721
Fat Daddy, my nephew,
he like mine.

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:48.724
We can offer you
a $1,000-a-month stipend.

01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:50.143
That would help, right?

01:18:51.686 --> 01:18:53.146
I can't leave Flint.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.189
My family need me.

01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:57.442
Well, at least take some time,
think it over.

01:18:57.525 --> 01:18:59.026
-Aye!
-Hey, Jason!

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.278
[Jason] Hey! Hey.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.612
Nicole, you good?

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:02.780
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Jason] Yeah.

01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:04.365
I appreciate you driving up.

01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:06.242
[Bob] Hey, Jason, Bob Coleman.
It's good to see you again.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:07.743
[Jason] Hey, Bob,
I know you, yeah.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:09.745
-Bob, all right.
-[Bob] Yeah.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:12.540
So, I understand that, uh,

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.375
you two
have hit a few roadblocks.

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:17.837
[laughs] You could, yeah,
you could say that.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.466
Well, the thing is, we, uh...

01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:23.384
Well, I don't have
the connections,

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:24.677
the contacts, you feel me?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.970
I mean, at first, it was a...

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:27.305
Look, all these other people

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.515
getting these endorsements
and sponsorships.

01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:31.350
Meanwhile, I can barely pay
my mama rent.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.854
Well, when it comes to someone
getting behind Claressa,

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:36.522
for someone to say,

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.399
"You know, I want this girl
to represent my brand..."

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.151
I've been wearing
the lip gloss

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.028
and them girly clothes
just like y'all said.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.323
And that is helpful, Claressa,
it really is, but...

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:47.825
For example, we would
love you to stop saying

01:19:47.909 --> 01:19:49.994
that you like hitting people
and making them cry.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.412
[laughs]

01:19:52.872 --> 01:19:53.831
Why?

01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:55.666
It makes you
seem like a bully.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.002
I box.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:19:59.587
I am a bully.

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.506
Floyd a bully, Ward a bully.

01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:03.049
Hell, even Ali was a bully.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.467
Yeah, we understand that.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.344
So, I can't be a bully
'cause I'm a girl.

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:08.137
I get what y'all saying.
I get what you saying.

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.764
It's a perception thing,
right?

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.057
-[Bob] Exactly.
-Right.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.433
-Oh, so it's my fault now?
-Ressa.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.522
Come on, now.
They trying to help us, okay?

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.024
What happened to
staying true to who you are?

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.778
I won that gold medal
by being me.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.238
And now,
to get endorsements and shit

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.697
y'all saying I gotta
be somebody else?

01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.408
I know that you're
disappointed. So are we.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:30.701
You deserve
so much more recognition.

01:20:30.785 --> 01:20:32.495
Nah, I don't deserve it,
I earned it.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.206
All right?
I earned that gold medal.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.374
It's a big difference.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:37.792
She just wound up
right now, y'all.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.168
I'm just
keeping it real! What?

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:40.336
[Bob] What is it, Claressa?

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.004
Is it the money,
is it the recognition?

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:43.881
Money is recognition!

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.346
And no offense, Mr. Coleman,

01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.848
but that $1,000,

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:54.392
it ain't shit.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.394
Not when a man get
three times as much

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:58.437
and ain't none of them
won a gold medal!

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:00.773
Hell, or any medal.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.692
-Ressa, come on and sit down.
-Nah, man!

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:18.958
[Mickey laughing]

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:24.297
Hey, baby.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.381
Hey, baby.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:37.727
Where you get off
talking like that? Huh?

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:39.812
-Jason. What...
-What?

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:40.980
What, baby? I'm just talking.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:43.107
I can't talk
in my own damn house now?

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.527
You embarrassed me today,
you know that?

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:47.987
You embarrassed me!

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.489
It's embarrassing.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:52.575
I'm done asking for shit
that should be mine.

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.577
So, what, you just gonna give
up now? That's how we do it?

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.287
Give up what?

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.748
It ain't no money
in pros for women.

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.333
And there ain't no money
staying amateur.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:01.959
So what you gonna do?

01:22:02.043 --> 01:22:03.461
What you gonna do?
You gonna get you a job

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:05.046
bagging groceries,
flipping burgers?

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.505
-Maybe.
-And then what?

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.592
[laughing] You gonna
move in with Zay?

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.427
You gonna move in with Zay
'cause y'all grown now, right?

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.720
Help watch Fat Daddy and Pea

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.347
or maybe have
some babies of your own.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.265
Here go Ressa,
with all them damn babies.

01:22:16.349 --> 01:22:17.433
What's so wrong
with that, huh?

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:18.643
Better than busting my ass

01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:19.810
when it don't
mean shit anyhow.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:21.062
See, y'all think
y'all know what it is,

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.563
but I'mma
tell it to you straight.

01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:24.273
That ain't enough for you.
That ain't enough for you

01:22:24.357 --> 01:22:25.483
'cause you different
than the rest of them.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:26.901
Maybe I'm done
being different!

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.277
Man, that's weak. You weak.

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:29.403
-That's weak! Yeah!
-Jason, come on, man.

01:22:29.487 --> 01:22:30.488
-[Claressa] I'm weak?
-[Jason] Yeah.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.864
-I'm weak?
-Yeah!

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.033
I've been training since
I was 11 years old.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.826
And now I got this damn
gold medal, and you...

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.328
[Jason] I don't give a damn
about that gold medal!

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.996
-Oh, really?
-Gold medal shit, all right?

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.373
'Cause before in London that's
all you wanted to talk about.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.707
I don't give a damn
about no gold medal!

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:42.667
Gold medal this,
gold medal that.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:43.918
I did my part,

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.169
-you didn't do yours!
-Oh, I ain't do my part?

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:47.088
I ain't do my part? Who taught
your ass how to box?

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.381
Claressa, please, come on.
Go to your room.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.507
Who taught you how to box?

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:50.925
-I'm out, man.
-Aye, aye, remember this,

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.635
without me, there'd be
no Claressa Shields!

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:55.554
Without me, there wouldn't be
no Jason Crutchfield!

01:22:57.098 --> 01:22:59.350
You said you had this, Jason.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.102
You said
you had it all figured out.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.395
[Corey] Mom?

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:04.814
Hey. Hey, baby, I'm...
Come on.

01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.691
Maybe if I was still
undefeated things would be

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:08.234
-a little different, right?
-Okay. Okay.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:09.610
We gonna take it all the way
back to China, then, huh?

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:11.862
You wasn't there!
You wasn't in the fight!

01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:13.572
And why wasn't I there?
Huh? You know why.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:14.990
'Cause we broke!

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:17.660
'Cause we broke.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.162
I don't make one damn penny
being your coach.

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:22.415
I'm a volunteer.
I do this shit for free.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:23.791
Matter of fact,

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.918
I'm losing money
and losing shifts

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.337
to coach your ungrateful ass!

01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:30.214
You got a gold medal, well,
good for you, little girl,

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.924
'cause we got bills
around here.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.468
And I got all y'all mouths
to feed, remember that.

01:23:34.552 --> 01:23:36.220
You know what, I'm done here.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.806
I'mma pack my shit and get
the hell up outta here.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:39.932
Be one less mouth to feed.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.642
Okay, then.
Okay, then, Big Time.

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:43.227
-You know the way out.
-Yep, I do.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.020
No. Come on, Ressa.
You don't need to leave.

01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:46.188
No, no, no, it's okay, Mickey.

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:49.108
I ain't mad at you.
But I'm gone, though.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:50.735
Aye, and leave my keys
on the table.

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:52.319
Yeah, no problem.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.224
[pensive music playing]

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.483
[sighs]

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:17.404
[Claressa] What is that?

01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:18.906
My secret recipe.

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:21.617
[Peanut] Uh-huh.
Salt and garlic.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.868
You the first
who think of that.

01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:24.870
-Go ahead and make jokes.
-[Claressa chuckles]

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:28.165
This is how it's done,
right here.

01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:30.584
[chuckles] I'm gonna go
to school for cooking

01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:31.794
starting next month.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.963
Yeah, you need to go
to cooking school

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:35.297
'cause you can't cook.

01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:36.966
[laughs]

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.050
You heard it.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.052
-[laughing]
-Shut up.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:45.224
[Jason] Straight punches, go!

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.483
Turn 'em into uppercuts, go!

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.111
Yeah.

01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:00.531
Is that yours?

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:01.740
[Briana] Ress?

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.492
What?

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.910
Watch Fat Daddy
for me tonight?

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:06.829
I gotta go grab something
from Ray and them.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.332
[Claressa] All right.
What time he go down?

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.419
8:00? 9:00?

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:15.546
When he tired, fool.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:20.467
-[Fat Daddy crying]
-No!

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.971
No, Mommy coming back.

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:25.347
She coming back.

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.516
She coming back!
She coming back!

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:34.064
Dawg, no. He still ain't home!

01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:35.357
Bri didn't come home
last night.

01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:36.525
I got Fat Daddy.

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:38.319
[Fat Daddy crying]

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.321
Bruh, if you see her,
tell her I'm pissed!

01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:41.906
Damn!

01:26:41.989 --> 01:26:43.741
No, no, no. It's okay, baby.

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:45.868
It ain't you I'm mad at,
it's your mama.

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:48.287
Yeah, all right. All right.
I'mma call you back. Okay.

01:26:51.457 --> 01:26:53.125
I'm gonna
get you some diapers, okay?

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:55.085
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:56.295
I know, I know, I know.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.185
[crying]

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:17.733
I know, I know, I know.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:19.443
It's okay.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:51.475
[melancholy music playing]

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:16.792
How can I help you?

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.378
I wanna pawn something.

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.964
All right,
you come to the right place.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:22.923
See what you got.

01:28:36.103 --> 01:28:38.772
That's pretty darn rare
what you got here.

01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:51.702
I don't have many gold medals

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:53.412
comin' through that door.

01:28:54.747 --> 01:28:57.124
I gotta look it up
on the Internet.

01:28:57.207 --> 01:28:59.001
Yes, sir.

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:00.252
It'll take a minute.

01:29:01.045 --> 01:29:02.588
Feel free to poke around.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.143
There was a girl that came
into the gym tonight

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:19.063
saying she wanted to be
the next Claressa Shields.

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:21.690
[laughs softly]

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:24.610
And she wasn't that much older
than Ressa was

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.986
when she first came by there.

01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:28.155
Actually, she looked
a lot like her.

01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:29.364
She fight like her?

01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:30.824
[giggles]

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.410
I wish.

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:37.206
Call her.

01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:40.417
You two peas in a pod.

01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:42.753
Only difference is,
you the adult here.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:44.588
[sighs]

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.759
Jason, she on her own.

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.766
She don't wanna hear from me.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.521
[door opens and closes]

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:03.607
Hey, baby.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:08.570
I apologize for the betrayal.

01:30:08.654 --> 01:30:11.156
Weren't no way I was gonna
let you pawn this medal.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:13.992
Thanks, honey.

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:18.247
AJ and I go back a ways.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.970
I just wanted to help, Ma.

01:30:37.057 --> 01:30:38.100
I know, baby.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:40.477
I know.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.107
But there's certain things
we just can't be giving away.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:46.483
Fuck this thing.

01:30:47.484 --> 01:30:48.944
I'm sick of looking at it.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.780
What good did it do?

01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:53.740
It ain't special.

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:55.450
No, it ain't special.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:59.246
But you is.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.584
You having this medal,

01:31:05.169 --> 01:31:07.421
lets folks around here know

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:09.381
that if Claressa Shields
can do it,

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.841
they can, too.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.345
So it ain't about a medal.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.223
It about you.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:23.854
Come here, baby.

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:27.983
[crying softly]

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:47.085
You ain't slick.

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.713
[laughing]

01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:53.383
I was worried you wouldn't
have enough fabric

01:31:53.467 --> 01:31:54.968
for them big ol' thighs.

01:31:55.052 --> 01:31:56.136
Ain't you mean.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.013
You made me.
These your thighs.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.264
Mmm.

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:01.266
The apple don't fall
far from the tree.

01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:02.643
You got that right.

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:04.394
I bet I could have won
the gold medal

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:05.729
if they had boxing back then.

What the hell
are you laughing at?

Don't act like y'all ain't
never seen me throw hands.

01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:14.821
All right,
that's my work done.

01:32:14.905 --> 01:32:17.616
So, how much all this cost?

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:19.284
For you, baby girl?

01:32:19.368 --> 01:32:20.661
It's on the house.

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:22.955
You out there reppin' for us,
so we gotta rep for you.
