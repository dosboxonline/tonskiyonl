00:22.732 --> 00:25.317
[Jim] Kenny!
You gotta come down here!

00:25.317 --> 00:28.738
There's enough food here to feed
everybody in the entire town!

00:28.738 --> 00:30.948
You think this place can't
break you?

00:30.948 --> 00:32.324
Let's see.

- [Boyd shouting]

00:34.827 --> 00:37.288
[Jade] You were in the barn
with her with those things.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.165
How are you still alive?

00:39.165 --> 00:40.750
They wanted me to watch.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.586
- Kenny.
- Wait. Where's-- where's my mom?

00:43.586 --> 00:44.795
Bud, I'm s--

00:44.795 --> 00:46.046
No! Stop! Just stop.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.676
[crying]

00:50.676 --> 00:52.094
[Boyd]
We need more information.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.471
- [Ellis] Yeah.
- [Boyd] I'm gonna need

00:53.471 --> 00:54.472
your help with
something tomorrow.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.140
With what?

00:56.140 --> 00:58.142
We're gonna catch one
of these fucking things.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.852
[Donna]
You're gonna have a baby

00:59.852 --> 01:02.688
that you were told
you could never have!

01:02.688 --> 01:04.148
With all you've seen,

01:04.148 --> 01:06.275
you can't wrap your head
around a miracle.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.027
[Marielle] You're
severely malnourished.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.196
We really just need
to get you eating again.

01:10.196 --> 01:11.655
Are those the crops?

01:11.655 --> 01:13.199
Yeah. We figured
we'd try composting them,

01:13.199 --> 01:15.034
see if we can't get
the soil turned around.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.035

You ready to tell me
what's going on with you?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.922
Still kinda working it
out for myself.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.133
Do you remember
the bracelet I made you?

01:31.133 --> 01:32.510
You're saying
you found a bracelet

01:32.510 --> 01:33.886
that's similar
to the one you made?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.304
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not similar.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.388
That is the bracelet.

would take her to the tower,

[Henry] Miranda
started seeing things.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.360
She painted everything she saw.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.404
She said it was like
she'd been chosen

01:52.404 --> 01:54.824
to free the children.

01:54.824 --> 01:58.244
I guess you've been
chosen now, too.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.246
When Thomas died,
you and Mom fell apart,

02:00.246 --> 02:02.081
and there was no one
there for Ethan.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.250

your shit together.

No, no, no, no, no.
He didn't lure me.

I just went there because
of, you know, the children.

in the tower.

actually a lighthouse,

they keep those things from
getting into the houses.

it's not always
