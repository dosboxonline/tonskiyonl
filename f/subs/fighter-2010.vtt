<i>- You bringing Micky in?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he's gonna come.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:49.009
<i>He should be here as well.</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:50.980
<i>You think he'll answer questions?</i>

00:51.117 --> 00:53.108
<i>They said it was</i>
<i>gonna be both of us here.</i>

00:54.320 --> 00:58.188
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

00:58.324 --> 01:01.885
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

01:02.028 --> 01:03.791
- Right over here.
...interviews?

01:05.799 --> 01:08.666
<i>I started boxing</i>
<i>when I was 12 years old,</i>

01:08.802 --> 01:11.168
<i>and I'd lie and say I was 18,</i>
<i>or whatever it was.</i>

01:11.304 --> 01:13.272
<i>You know, I had a different</i>
<i>name and everything.</i>

01:13.406 --> 01:14.600
<i>I mean, I don't know how many fights...</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:18.142
<i>I'd done a hundred, more than that,</i>
<i>before I turned professional.</i>

01:18.278 --> 01:21.179
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

01:21.314 --> 01:23.441
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

01:23.583 --> 01:27.280
<i>This is my younger brother.</i>
<i>I taught him everything he knows.</i>

01:27.420 --> 01:29.320
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

01:29.456 --> 01:33.483
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

01:33.626 --> 01:35.093
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.628
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.057
<i>In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

01:41.201 --> 01:43.465
<i>I went toe-to-toe with him.</i>
<i>He couldn't get to me.</i>

01:43.603 --> 01:45.400
<i>He couldn't get to me.</i>

01:45.538 --> 01:48.200
<i>They called me the pride...</i>
<i>the pride of Lowell.</i>

01:48.341 --> 01:50.969
<i>Everybody still talks about it,</i>
<i>especially my brother.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:52.942
<i>His whole life he wanted</i>
<i>to do what I did, you know?</i>

01:53.079 --> 01:55.912
<i>But we're very different fighters.</i>

01:56.049 --> 01:57.778
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.181
He's got... a thunderous,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.346
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.822
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.324
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.520
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.491
Come on.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.393
Dicky.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.599
Would you come on?

02:51.738 --> 02:54.571
Will you stop...?
You gotta help me finish this.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.410
Come on!

02:58.545 --> 03:00.410
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

03:00.547 --> 03:01.741
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.145
To see where this fight is headed.

03:04.284 --> 03:08.311
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

03:08.454 --> 03:11.787
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

03:11.925 --> 03:17.557
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

03:17.697 --> 03:21.463
The pride of Lowell is back!

03:21.601 --> 03:25.401
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

03:25.538 --> 03:27.631
Who wants some?!

03:46.793 --> 03:50.229
Hey! I want a cut.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.234
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.200
How are ya?

04:00.607 --> 04:04.907
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

04:05.044 --> 04:07.877
Lou! Hey, Lou!

04:08.014 --> 04:10.209
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.885
Making my comeback.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.983
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

04:22.295 --> 04:25.628
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.027
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.039
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

04:38.177 --> 04:40.236
HBO's making a movie on me!

04:40.380 --> 04:42.780
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.751
Did you tap that?

04:50.890 --> 04:53.484
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

04:53.626 --> 04:57.528
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

04:57.664 --> 04:59.859
Are you nuts?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.729
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

05:02.869 --> 05:06.168
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.035
You're doing well.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.712
You're walking. Get on it.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.633
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

05:35.768 --> 05:38.202
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

05:38.338 --> 05:40.898
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.237
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

05:44.377 --> 05:47.107
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.338
You gotta pay them to shut up.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.574
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.947
Yeah, come on, Micky.

05:53.086 --> 05:57.489
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

05:57.623 --> 05:59.614
You know where he is.

06:16.576 --> 06:20.410
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.514
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

06:22.648 --> 06:24.639
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

06:24.784 --> 06:27.844
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

06:27.987 --> 06:30.512
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.556
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

06:32.692 --> 06:34.956
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.892
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.726
Don't. Just forget about him.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.267
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.166
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

06:45.304 --> 06:46.532
You want me to do that again?

06:46.672 --> 06:49.197
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.334
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

06:52.478 --> 06:55.777
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.611
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.309
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

07:00.453 --> 07:04.787
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.983
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

07:07.126 --> 07:09.287
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.862
Art, Art, where's the video at?

07:16.969 --> 07:20.871
<i>Tonight, my son is gonna surprise</i>
<i>everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.</i>

07:21.007 --> 07:23.202
<i>Believe me, I know it.</i>

07:25.244 --> 07:27.235
<i>Sugar Ray might have</i>
<i>some trouble tonight.</i>

07:27.380 --> 07:30.679
<i>That's a good possibility.</i>
<i>He comes in here against a good boxer,</i>

07:30.817 --> 07:34.082
<i>a young man who can punch,</i>
<i>and I would like to say at this time</i>

07:34.220 --> 07:36.484
<i>that physically</i>
<i>they're just about equal.</i>

07:55.074 --> 07:58.271
<i>Leonard is down.</i>
<i>Let's see if that's a knockdown.</i>

07:59.579 --> 08:01.376
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

08:03.349 --> 08:05.613
<i>Eklund just walked over him!</i>

08:05.751 --> 08:08.743
<i>Nobody seems</i>
<i>to know what's happening!</i>

08:14.460 --> 08:17.793
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.563
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

08:21.701 --> 08:23.726
training Micky right now?

08:23.870 --> 08:27.397
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11:45!

08:27.540 --> 08:30.065
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?!

08:30.209 --> 08:32.734
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

08:32.879 --> 08:34.904
I didn't park it. You did.
I didn't park it.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.446
Check your fuckin' pockets
for the keys.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.982
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

08:39.118 --> 08:41.881
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.818
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

08:43.956 --> 08:46.049
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

08:46.192 --> 08:51.255
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.490
Hey.

09:18.624 --> 09:19.682
Hey!

09:21.527 --> 09:22.619
Quacka!

09:22.762 --> 09:26.357
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.491
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.068
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

09:35.207 --> 09:39.303
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

09:39.445 --> 09:40.935
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.516
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

09:44.650 --> 09:47.483
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.917
OK.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.852
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

09:50.990 --> 09:53.686
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.987
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

09:56.128 --> 10:00.531
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.531
I think we got all the bases covered.

10:02.668 --> 10:07.105
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.070
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.472
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.976
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

10:13.112 --> 10:15.740
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

10:15.881 --> 10:17.314
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

10:17.450 --> 10:19.441
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

10:19.585 --> 10:21.143
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.625
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

10:34.233 --> 10:37.031
And again! One, two, three, four...

10:37.670 --> 10:40.195
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

10:41.040 --> 10:43.406
There you go! There you go!

10:51.951 --> 10:53.782
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

10:53.919 --> 10:55.511
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.814
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.391
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.960
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.791
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

11:05.931 --> 11:08.559
calling the fight for ESPN.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.966
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.163
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.597
Hook!

11:16.742 --> 11:18.835
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.445
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.706
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.578
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

11:25.718 --> 11:26.844
Fuck.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.621
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.383
That's your punch.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.221
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.728
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

11:39.965 --> 11:41.865
Hey, right there, Tar!

11:42.001 --> 11:44.435
That's not helping, George!

11:44.570 --> 11:46.731
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.737
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.342
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

11:51.477 --> 11:56.244
- Dick Eklund Sr. Is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.610
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

11:57.750 --> 12:01.550
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

12:01.687 --> 12:04.747
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

12:04.890 --> 12:06.881
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.254
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.490
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

12:12.631 --> 12:15.964
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

12:16.102 --> 12:20.368
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.335
Charlene! Charlene!

12:26.212 --> 12:27.770
Hey, Charlene!

12:27.913 --> 12:30.711
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

12:30.850 --> 12:34.013
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

12:35.821 --> 12:37.812
On the count of three... Three!

12:40.993 --> 12:43.723
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.299
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.674
I told her all about you.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.175
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.306
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

13:03.449 --> 13:07.180
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.219
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

13:16.362 --> 13:20.389
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.626
Thinks you're the greatest.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.202
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.668
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.501
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.233
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

13:30.376 --> 13:33.038
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.976
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.674
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.184
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.481
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

13:43.622 --> 13:45.112
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

13:45.257 --> 13:50.559
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

13:50.696 --> 13:52.926
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.090
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.634
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.863
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.633
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.710
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.779
You be nice. OK?

14:07.913 --> 14:09.574
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.411
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.019
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

14:15.154 --> 14:17.088
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

14:17.223 --> 14:20.249
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

14:20.392 --> 14:23.486
Right? Right? Hey!

14:23.629 --> 14:25.790
- Right.
- That's right!

14:25.931 --> 14:27.489
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.466
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.731
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.341
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.807
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

14:38.944 --> 14:40.605
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.475
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.243
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'

14:45.384 --> 14:48.080
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

14:48.220 --> 14:51.280
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.516
Where did they find a guy like that?

14:53.659 --> 14:55.490
He's no joke. Former world champ.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.960
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.031
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

15:00.165 --> 15:01.860
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.936
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin'

15:05.070 --> 15:07.698
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.467
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

15:09.608 --> 15:11.803
Brawlin' you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

15:11.944 --> 15:15.243
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.906
And go head, body, head, body.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.945
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

15:22.087 --> 15:24.419
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

15:24.556 --> 15:26.490
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

15:26.625 --> 15:28.923
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

15:29.061 --> 15:31.029
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.654
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

15:33.799 --> 15:37.633
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.364
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

15:42.908 --> 15:44.637
Are you married?

15:44.777 --> 15:46.642
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.906
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.709
I'm not like that.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.818
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.319
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.650
Come on. Let me take you out.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.188
When?

16:02.328 --> 16:04.660
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.608
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.151
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.504
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

16:52.644 --> 16:54.805
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.815
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.112
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.811
It's not your day. Good-bye.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.888
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

17:05.023 --> 17:09.290
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.090
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.361
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.733
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.306
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.340
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.340
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

17:26.478 --> 17:29.447
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

17:29.581 --> 17:31.811
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.850
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

17:33.986 --> 17:37.422
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.023
Good luck, Daddy.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.457
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

17:44.163 --> 17:45.152
Where is he?

17:45.297 --> 17:48.266
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.602
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

17:59.478 --> 18:03.005
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

18:03.148 --> 18:06.015
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

18:06.151 --> 18:08.449
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.317
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.890
You're already doing it without him.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.516
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

18:15.661 --> 18:18.653
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

18:18.797 --> 18:21.891
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

18:22.034 --> 18:25.902
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.046
Dicky.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.744
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.817
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

18:48.994 --> 18:50.689
I'm not here.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.588
- Oh, no.
- What?

18:54.733 --> 18:56.257
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

18:56.401 --> 18:58.301
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

18:58.437 --> 18:59.665
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

18:59.805 --> 19:01.432
...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

19:03.075 --> 19:04.736
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

19:04.877 --> 19:07.072
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.737
You know how important
this fight is to me.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.941
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.142
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.219
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

19:15.354 --> 19:17.413
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.490
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.320
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.894
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

19:25.564 --> 19:26.622
What are you doing?

19:26.765 --> 19:28.494
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

19:28.634 --> 19:29.931
Why'd you make me do that to you?

19:30.068 --> 19:31.330
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.994
I was on my way! Ma...

19:33.138 --> 19:36.335
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.171
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

19:39.311 --> 19:42.075
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.682
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.546
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.177
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.755
You got him, pal.

20:09.975 --> 20:13.206
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

20:13.345 --> 20:16.746
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.318
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

20:20.452 --> 20:21.976
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.487
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

20:25.624 --> 20:27.319
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.757
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

20:29.895 --> 20:33.695
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

20:33.832 --> 20:35.959
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

20:36.101 --> 20:37.193
Yeah.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.667
Micky, we can still have a fight.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.602
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.934
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.940
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.875
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.140
He's the only guy I could find.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.944
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.212
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.049
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.454
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.785
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.453
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.724
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.800
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.029
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

21:13.171 --> 21:17.301
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.003
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

21:21.146 --> 21:24.138
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.582
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

21:27.719 --> 21:31.314
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.261
OK.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.858
So, Lou... Come on, please.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.970
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.537
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

21:47.673 --> 21:51.575
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

21:51.710 --> 21:54.702
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.337
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.246
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.979
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

22:03.121 --> 22:04.281
- Scared?
- Yeah.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.721
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.951
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

22:09.094 --> 22:12.495
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

22:12.631 --> 22:15.862
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.061
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

22:19.204 --> 22:21.764
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.137
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.608
You watch from the outside, pal.

22:26.745 --> 22:32.012
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!</i>

22:34.019 --> 22:36.010
Holy shit.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.452
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.285
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

22:40.425 --> 22:43.053
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.992
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.430
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.159
That guy's no welterweight.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.065
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.605
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.641
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

22:57.776 --> 23:00.006
I don't care who that guy is...

23:00.145 --> 23:02.443
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.776
You're Micky Ward.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.953
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.523
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

23:13.658 --> 23:16.627
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

23:17.162 --> 23:18.561
Now it's big Mike...

23:18.697 --> 23:21.962
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

23:22.100 --> 23:25.035
- Come on! Come on!
...four, five...

23:26.304 --> 23:27.601
...six...

23:27.739 --> 23:30.139
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

23:30.275 --> 23:31.435
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

23:33.145 --> 23:35.340
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.277
Hey, you, back off!

23:40.986 --> 23:41.975
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

23:44.423 --> 23:45.913
Ward, a respected fighter.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.321
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

23:48.460 --> 23:52.453
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

24:14.352 --> 24:15.512
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

24:15.654 --> 24:17.315
<i>before we get started,</i>
<i>a lot of people have been asking</i>

24:17.456 --> 24:20.220
<i>about the big night</i>
<i>of boxing on November 4.</i>

24:20.358 --> 24:22.656
<i>Three world championship bouts...</i>

24:22.794 --> 24:25.729
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

24:27.232 --> 24:30.565
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin' man?

24:30.702 --> 24:32.932
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

24:33.071 --> 24:36.632
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

24:36.775 --> 24:39.972
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

24:40.111 --> 24:42.102
I knocked Ray down.

24:42.247 --> 24:43.908
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.449
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

24:46.585 --> 24:48.576
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.086
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

24:51.223 --> 24:54.124
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

24:55.293 --> 24:56.783
Can I call ya?

24:56.928 --> 25:00.625
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.427
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

25:03.568 --> 25:05.798
My comeback. Right?

25:05.937 --> 25:08.770
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

25:08.907 --> 25:10.397
You don't be a stranger!

25:11.209 --> 25:13.439
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

25:13.578 --> 25:14.567
What's that?

25:14.713 --> 25:17.204
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.374
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

25:19.518 --> 25:23.318
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

25:23.455 --> 25:26.390
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.891
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

25:29.027 --> 25:31.552
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.257
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.765
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

25:36.902 --> 25:40.133
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.830
What about my brother?

25:41.973 --> 25:44.441
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

25:44.576 --> 25:47.704
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

25:47.846 --> 25:50.371
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

25:50.515 --> 25:53.279
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

25:53.418 --> 25:57.081
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.689
You should've given it up.

26:00.258 --> 26:03.318
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

26:03.461 --> 26:06.328
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

26:06.464 --> 26:08.955
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.001
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

26:12.137 --> 26:15.402
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

26:15.540 --> 26:16.905
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.873
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

26:20.211 --> 26:22.111
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

26:23.148 --> 26:26.276
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.353
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

26:29.487 --> 26:33.184
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

26:33.325 --> 26:35.555
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

26:35.694 --> 26:37.889
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

26:38.029 --> 26:42.591
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

26:42.734 --> 26:44.565
He didn't mention you.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.202
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.639
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.176
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

26:54.312 --> 26:57.076
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

26:57.215 --> 27:00.013
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.415
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.385
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.511
That's right.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.716
You guys can spar a little, right?

27:07.859 --> 27:09.918
Where are they?

27:10.061 --> 27:11.892
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

27:12.030 --> 27:15.796
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

27:15.934 --> 27:16.992
I love you!

27:17.869 --> 27:19.063
Thank you.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.229
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

27:21.373 --> 27:25.571
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.938
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

27:27.078 --> 27:29.706
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

27:29.848 --> 27:33.375
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.884
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.148
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

27:38.289 --> 27:39.688
What don't you wanna do no more?

27:39.824 --> 27:41.314
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

27:41.459 --> 27:45.725
- What are you...?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

27:45.864 --> 27:50.267
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.802
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.905
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.769
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.432
What do you think?

27:59.444 --> 28:02.004
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

28:02.147 --> 28:04.342
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.177
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.751
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

28:08.887 --> 28:10.479
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

28:10.622 --> 28:11.611
What are you talking about?

28:11.756 --> 28:13.587
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.590
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.854
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

28:17.996 --> 28:20.760
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

28:21.666 --> 28:23.429
Come on, let's go inside.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.866
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

28:26.004 --> 28:28.472
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.369
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

29:27.899 --> 29:30.060
Who is it?

29:50.922 --> 29:53.254
I saw the shade move.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.154
Micky, the shade is still moving.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.524
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.530
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

30:01.666 --> 30:03.861
why you didn't call me yesterday.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.105
Why'd you stand me up last night?

30:12.243 --> 30:15.508
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.171
'Cause you lost the fight?

30:17.315 --> 30:19.909
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.848
How'd you know my house, anyway?

30:21.986 --> 30:23.783
I asked my brother.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.756
Your thing's coming off.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.791
I mean your other thing.

30:30.929 --> 30:32.556
You got any tape?

30:40.305 --> 30:43.502
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

30:43.641 --> 30:47.042
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.875
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

30:51.015 --> 30:54.917
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

30:55.053 --> 30:57.749
I never should've fought him.

30:57.889 --> 31:02.553
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.458
Everybody said I could've beat him.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.963
Who's everybody?

31:08.099 --> 31:10.897
My mother, my brother.

31:13.504 --> 31:16.598
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

31:43.801 --> 31:46.565
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.064
- You look great.
- Thank you.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.040
Got a nice house, too.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.236
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.075
One of my old roommates lives in one.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.614
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.877
- College.
- College. Wow.

32:01.019 --> 32:03.647
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.689
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.384
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

32:09.527 --> 32:12.087
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.324
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

32:15.466 --> 32:16.626
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

32:16.768 --> 32:18.929
- Yeah.
- For what?

32:19.070 --> 32:22.403
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.839
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

32:25.977 --> 32:28.912
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.207
You?

32:45.830 --> 32:47.593
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

32:47.732 --> 32:49.063
You come to this theater a lot?

32:49.200 --> 32:51.168
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.328
- Yeah, like what?
<i>- Belli Epi-que.</i>

32:54.472 --> 32:58.203
I think it's <i>Belle Epic.</i>
It's "epic." <i>Belle Epic.</i>

32:58.343 --> 33:01.471
<i>Belle Epoque.</i>
<i>The New York Times</i> loved it.

33:01.612 --> 33:03.477
Well, I never heard of it.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.707
Where'd you hear about it?
<i>The New York Times?</i>

33:05.850 --> 33:08.114
No, a guy from work.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.083
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

33:10.221 --> 33:11.518
Oh, cool.

33:28.306 --> 33:29.603
Thank you.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.714
That's the movie you wanted to see?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.151
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

33:44.288 --> 33:47.689
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.059
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

33:51.195 --> 33:53.026
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

33:54.332 --> 33:56.266
What's going on?

33:56.401 --> 33:59.495
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

33:59.637 --> 34:02.162
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

34:02.306 --> 34:04.103
I... I like you.

34:04.809 --> 34:08.040
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.612
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.342
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.281
You don't think I wanted to call you?

34:15.420 --> 34:20.722
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

34:25.096 --> 34:27.963
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

34:30.935 --> 34:33.165
Don't say that about my family.

34:33.304 --> 34:37.239
What else can I say
after what you told me?

34:37.375 --> 34:39.400
I mean, look at your face.

34:40.878 --> 34:42.208
Look at you.

35:06.471 --> 35:09.998
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

35:10.141 --> 35:12.507
and give us a fight that's fair.

35:12.643 --> 35:15.407
My boy could've got killed last time.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.142
Yeah, like what?

35:20.418 --> 35:23.353
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

35:27.492 --> 35:30.461
He's coming off a loss?

35:30.595 --> 35:33.359
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.659
We got a great opportunity here.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.133
We gotta go find Micky.

35:38.269 --> 35:41.067
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.368
Jesus.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.000
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.204
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

35:49.347 --> 35:52.339
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.451
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.713
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.048
I heard she's into three-ways.

36:00.191 --> 36:03.024
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.924
MTV...
What are you talking about?

36:05.062 --> 36:06.290
Wild.

36:06.430 --> 36:09.490
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

36:10.701 --> 36:13.329
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.962
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.976
I've gotta go find Dicky.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.546
Dicky!

37:18.302 --> 37:21.328
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

37:22.573 --> 37:25.838
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

37:26.611 --> 37:28.636
Don't worry about it, Ma.

37:33.117 --> 37:36.416
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.954
Hey, Alice...

37:40.191 --> 37:42.056
Alice...

37:42.193 --> 37:45.959
<i>I started a joke</i>

37:46.097 --> 37:51.034
<i>Which started the whole world cryin'</i>

37:51.168 --> 37:55.332
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

37:55.473 --> 37:59.204
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

37:59.343 --> 38:03.040
<i>I started to cry</i>

38:03.180 --> 38:08.516
<i>Which started</i>
<i>the whole world laughin'</i>

38:08.653 --> 38:12.453
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

38:12.590 --> 38:15.923
<i>That the joke was on me</i>

38:16.060 --> 38:19.757
<i>I looked at the skies</i>

38:19.897 --> 38:25.767
<i>Runnin'my hands over my eyes</i>

38:25.903 --> 38:31.569
<i>And I fell out of bed</i>

38:31.709 --> 38:34.109
<i>Hurting my head...</i>

38:50.561 --> 38:53.655
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

38:53.798 --> 38:57.757
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

38:57.902 --> 39:00.370
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.064
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

39:03.207 --> 39:05.072
Be nice.

39:05.209 --> 39:06.870
Don't use the nicknames.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.677
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.411
Speaking of family...

39:25.830 --> 39:27.058
Hello.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.729
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.761
I've heard a lot about you.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.873
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

39:37.007 --> 39:38.941
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

39:39.076 --> 39:41.135
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

39:42.046 --> 39:46.380
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.342
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

39:49.487 --> 39:55.016
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

39:55.159 --> 39:58.595
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.026
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.826
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.959
Which is still... good money, Mick.

40:06.103 --> 40:07.764
Yeah.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.536
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

40:11.675 --> 40:14.200
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.105
Like what?

40:23.487 --> 40:25.785
What's best for you, sweetheart?

40:25.923 --> 40:28.050
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.558
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

40:30.694 --> 40:33.993
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.167
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

40:39.303 --> 40:43.205
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.673
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

40:47.978 --> 40:50.242
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

40:50.381 --> 40:51.939
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.209
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.649
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.652
The whole routine.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.019
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

41:01.158 --> 41:02.557
Let him talk. Listen.

41:02.693 --> 41:05.526
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

41:05.663 --> 41:07.062
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.995
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.391
Mick, what's the problem?

41:12.937 --> 41:15.269
- The problems.
- What problems?

41:15.406 --> 41:18.671
- Problems...
- Like what?

41:18.809 --> 41:22.939
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.311
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

41:26.450 --> 41:29.112
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.114
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

41:35.259 --> 41:38.820
I'm Charlene. We just met.

41:38.963 --> 41:41.898
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.466
Hi, I'm Charlene.

41:44.935 --> 41:45.924
Hi, I'm Charlene.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.766
Hey, we're together!

41:49.773 --> 41:53.903
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

41:54.044 --> 41:55.909
What's she know about boxing?

41:56.046 --> 42:01.040
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

42:01.185 --> 42:03.676
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

42:07.391 --> 42:09.450
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

42:09.593 --> 42:11.060
Come on, Micky.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.756
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

42:15.966 --> 42:21.097
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

42:21.238 --> 42:24.696
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

42:24.842 --> 42:26.139
whatever the fuck that means.

42:26.277 --> 42:27.676
- Skank.
- It's wild.

42:29.580 --> 42:34.347
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

42:34.485 --> 42:37.147
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

42:37.288 --> 42:41.520
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

42:41.659 --> 42:42.921
That's all she's talking about.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.028
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

42:45.162 --> 42:49.258
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

42:49.400 --> 42:54.997
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

42:55.139 --> 43:00.634
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

43:00.778 --> 43:02.643
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.771
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

43:04.915 --> 43:08.681
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

43:10.654 --> 43:14.715
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

43:19.630 --> 43:22.724
<i>So, you put in $200, right?</i>

43:22.866 --> 43:25.562
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

43:26.804 --> 43:28.999
...and you got your 2,000.

43:34.979 --> 43:38.380
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

43:38.515 --> 43:40.073
Ten lucky ones.

43:43.687 --> 43:44.676
You rip us off.

43:44.822 --> 43:46.414
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

43:46.557 --> 43:48.650
You give me $200.

43:48.792 --> 43:52.785
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

43:52.930 --> 43:55.558
Right? You understand? No?

44:00.137 --> 44:03.038
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

44:04.241 --> 44:08.337
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

44:09.213 --> 44:11.545
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.378
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

44:14.518 --> 44:18.045
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

44:18.188 --> 44:20.520
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.354
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.462
White people do this
to other white people.

44:25.596 --> 44:28.497
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

44:28.632 --> 44:32.329
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

44:37.074 --> 44:39.269
I mean, they didn't understand.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.537
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

44:41.679 --> 44:45.080
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

44:45.215 --> 44:47.513
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

44:47.651 --> 44:50.085
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

44:50.220 --> 44:53.155
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

44:53.290 --> 44:56.782
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

44:56.927 --> 44:58.986
What's this movie about, again?

44:59.129 --> 45:01.689
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

45:01.832 --> 45:05.700
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

45:08.238 --> 45:09.933
Fuck.

45:12.209 --> 45:14.234
We gotta get Mick's money.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.117
Yes! That was awesome!

45:52.616 --> 45:55.176
Go. Right now.

45:58.489 --> 46:01.117
Go, go, go...

46:14.338 --> 46:16.272
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

46:16.406 --> 46:19.068
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

46:19.209 --> 46:21.609
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

46:21.745 --> 46:23.337
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

46:23.480 --> 46:27.507
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

46:27.651 --> 46:30.347
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

46:30.487 --> 46:32.978
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

46:34.424 --> 46:36.392
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.324
What the fuck?!

46:41.465 --> 46:44.161
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

46:44.301 --> 46:48.032
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking...!

47:19.303 --> 47:22.101
Ta-da! What do you think?

47:23.574 --> 47:26.975
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

47:27.110 --> 47:31.069
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

47:31.215 --> 47:33.274
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

47:36.119 --> 47:38.212
Did you hear me?!

47:40.958 --> 47:45.258
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

47:49.700 --> 47:51.861
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

47:52.002 --> 47:54.596
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

47:56.874 --> 47:59.570
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

47:59.710 --> 48:01.575
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

48:01.712 --> 48:05.079
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

48:12.823 --> 48:14.620
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

48:14.758 --> 48:17.318
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

48:17.461 --> 48:19.691
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

48:19.830 --> 48:22.128
Now you're involved!

48:22.266 --> 48:25.702
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

48:25.836 --> 48:27.827
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

48:29.640 --> 48:33.098
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

48:33.243 --> 48:35.575
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.442
Move 'em out!

48:42.653 --> 48:45.554
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

48:46.556 --> 48:47.750
Don't tell me to come on.

48:47.891 --> 48:49.688
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

48:49.826 --> 48:52.226
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

48:52.362 --> 48:55.422
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.726
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

48:59.369 --> 49:01.030
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

49:01.171 --> 49:02.331
What the fuck, man!

49:02.472 --> 49:05.270
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

49:05.409 --> 49:07.309
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.877
Look at his hands.

49:09.012 --> 49:10.206
Shit.

49:12.549 --> 49:16.645
Go home, folks. Good night!

49:36.473 --> 49:40.068
Welcome back, Dicky.

Case continued, two weeks from today.

50:11.575 --> 50:15.341
- Come on.
- Judy, can I have the file three-57?

50:15.479 --> 50:18.573
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

50:22.486 --> 50:24.386
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

50:24.521 --> 50:25.681
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

50:25.822 --> 50:27.084
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

50:27.224 --> 50:29.988
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

50:30.127 --> 50:33.028
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

50:33.163 --> 50:34.630
You did it for me? What, this?

50:34.765 --> 50:37.359
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

50:37.501 --> 50:39.264
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

50:39.403 --> 50:41.496
What are you
gonna do without me?

50:42.572 --> 50:45.006
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

50:45.142 --> 50:47.042
They should've just put me in the car!

50:47.944 --> 50:50.742
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

51:04.027 --> 51:07.292
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

51:08.532 --> 51:10.932
Hey, Eklund!

51:11.068 --> 51:12.660
Dicky!

51:13.937 --> 51:15.632
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

51:15.772 --> 51:18.673
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

52:01.585 --> 52:03.018
Who is it?

52:09.459 --> 52:11.552
<i>I don't want to see you, Micky.</i>

52:11.695 --> 52:15.062
- Charlene...
- <i>I can't take it.</i>

52:15.198 --> 52:18.133
<i>I'm not gonna let you</i>
<i>or your family drag me down.</i>

52:18.268 --> 52:20.828
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.962
I don't need it anymore.

52:23.607 --> 52:26.906
- That's fuckin' stupid.
- <i>What? Why?</i>

52:27.043 --> 52:29.409
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

52:29.546 --> 52:31.446
with their stupid bullshit.

52:33.049 --> 52:35.745
<i>What else can I do, Charlene?</i>

52:35.886 --> 52:37.444
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

52:37.587 --> 52:39.350
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

52:39.489 --> 52:42.287
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.791
Charlene...

52:44.928 --> 52:46.293
<i>Don't call.</i>

52:46.429 --> 52:48.454
Come on.

52:48.598 --> 52:50.225
<i>Don't call me, OK?</i>

52:59.543 --> 53:01.909
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin' man?

53:03.580 --> 53:05.571
Poor fucker!

53:08.752 --> 53:10.310
Hang in there, man!

53:10.453 --> 53:12.182
Go, Dicky!

53:18.862 --> 53:20.489
Hey, Dicky!

53:21.498 --> 53:23.830
Hey, keep it quiet!

53:40.083 --> 53:42.517
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

53:44.588 --> 53:45.850
Good.

53:56.399 --> 53:59.232
<i>And this Friday,</i>
<i>an HBO original documentary.</i>

53:59.369 --> 54:02.338
<i>Right here in Lowell, Mass,</i>

54:19.356 --> 54:20.880
Oh, look who it is.

54:24.561 --> 54:25.926
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

54:26.062 --> 54:27.324
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.330
Hey.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.761
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

54:37.707 --> 54:40.073
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

54:40.210 --> 54:42.337
How you feeling? How's the hand?

54:43.513 --> 54:45.845
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

54:45.982 --> 54:49.645
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

54:49.786 --> 54:52.983
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

54:53.123 --> 54:55.182
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

54:55.325 --> 54:57.190
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

54:57.327 --> 54:58.817
What are yous looking at?

55:00.163 --> 55:02.791
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

55:02.932 --> 55:04.661
I gotta go.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.463
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

55:07.604 --> 55:10.630
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

55:16.179 --> 55:17.908
Hollywood!

55:18.948 --> 55:22.247
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

55:23.086 --> 55:26.954
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

55:31.728 --> 55:33.559
All right!

55:41.905 --> 55:43.463

<i>the Industrial Revolution in America.</i>

55:59.889 --> 56:03.518
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.853
<i>I used to live over there.</i>
<i>This town got good memories, right?</i>

56:07.997 --> 56:09.965
<i>- Check it out.</i>
<i>- Fuck, yeah.</i>

56:10.100 --> 56:12.830
<i>- This house here, this white house?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

56:12.969 --> 56:15.529
<i>White, big fat guy.</i>
<i>First time I got my crack, over here.</i>

56:15.672 --> 56:17.799
<i>Did you ever know that?</i>
<i>They smoke crack at the White House?</i>

56:19.275 --> 56:21.266
<i>White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.</i>

56:21.411 --> 56:23.936
<i>The first time I did crack, or whatever,</i>
<i>I was about 23</i>

56:24.080 --> 56:25.809
<i>and a friend of mine gave me</i>
<i>a gram, or whatever.</i>

56:25.949 --> 56:27.917
<i>Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.</i>

56:28.051 --> 56:31.543
<i>Before that, I'd been doing</i>
<i>the Silver Mittens and stuff.</i>

56:31.688 --> 56:35.249
<i>I was the only kid.</i>
<i>I'd be 12... I was shit-faced.</i>

56:35.392 --> 56:36.950
<i>I'll tell ya how crack works.</i>

56:39.129 --> 56:43.122
<i>When it enters your lungs...</i>
<i>When it enters your lungs...</i>

56:43.266 --> 56:46.997
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

56:47.137 --> 56:50.300
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.500
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

56:53.643 --> 56:56.168
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

56:56.312 --> 56:58.439
<i>OK, yeah, there's my boys</i>
<i>right there. Check 'em out.</i>

56:58.581 --> 57:02.142
<i>- What kind of snake's that? Python?</i>
<i>- Yeah, check it out, man.</i>

57:02.285 --> 57:04.583
<i>- It's not gonna bite me or something?</i>
<i>- He's cool.</i>

57:07.357 --> 57:09.723
<i>It's been a while.</i>
<i>I'll take anything right now.</i>

57:11.094 --> 57:12.959
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

57:13.096 --> 57:14.461
I always dreamed about it...

57:16.766 --> 57:19.234
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

57:21.905 --> 57:24.305
<i>Dicky... put Lowell on the map.</i>

57:24.441 --> 57:27.001
<i>He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.</i>

57:27.143 --> 57:31.978
<i>Yeah, he knocked him down,</i>
<i>but I don't think it was a knockdown.</i>

57:32.115 --> 57:34.811
<i>- I think he slipped.</i>
<i>- He knocked him down.</i>

57:34.951 --> 57:37.317
<i>- He didn't slip.</i>
<i>- He slipped.</i>

57:37.454 --> 57:39.718
<i>- Oh... and you're from Lowell.</i>
<i>- Yeah, come on.</i>

57:39.856 --> 57:43.314
- That's a fuckin' lie!
<i>- They said he's in trouble with drugs.</i>

57:43.460 --> 57:46.224
<i>What is this? Are you talking</i>
<i>shit about the family?</i>

57:46.362 --> 57:49.559
<i>- Oh, no, no, no...</i>
<i>- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."</i>

57:49.699 --> 57:51.758
<i>We're not like that.</i>
<i>This is not what Lowell is all about.</i>

57:51.901 --> 57:53.300
<i>I thought he could make a comeback</i>

57:53.436 --> 57:56.269
<i>- and make us proud, but he didn't.</i>
<i>- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.</i>

57:56.406 --> 57:58.533
<i>Very disappointing,</i>
<i>very disgusting.</i>

57:58.675 --> 58:01.906
<i>You brought the city of</i>
<i>Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.</i>

58:02.045 --> 58:03.842
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Jimmy?

58:03.980 --> 58:06.608
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

58:06.749 --> 58:09.343
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.181
I got it...

58:11.321 --> 58:14.449
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

58:14.591 --> 58:15.990
- What?
- <i>Who you are.</i>

58:16.125 --> 58:18.252
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

58:18.394 --> 58:21.659
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- <i>Laurie, turn it off, please.</i>

58:21.798 --> 58:24.198
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.733
She's a kid.

58:26.269 --> 58:29.796
<i>When you smoke crack, you know...</i>

58:29.939 --> 58:32.134
<i>... you feel so much lighter.</i>

58:32.275 --> 58:35.506
<i>You know, you feel young, like when</i>
<i>everything was in front of you,</i>

58:35.645 --> 58:37.977
<i>everything was just...</i>

58:38.848 --> 58:42.181
<i>... everything was... just...</i>

58:42.318 --> 58:44.183
<i>... it was in front of you, you know?</i>

58:45.622 --> 58:47.988
<i>And then...</i>

58:48.124 --> 58:50.786
<i>... it fades and you</i>
<i>gotta get high again.</i>

58:56.099 --> 58:59.796
<i>Your part in the movie</i>
<i>is gonna end with you going to jail.</i>

59:01.571 --> 59:05.701
<i>What about little Dicky?</i>
<i>Who's gonna take care of him, huh?</i>

59:08.978 --> 59:11.446
<i>You guys can't talk to 'em?</i>

59:12.649 --> 59:14.549
<i>Oh, man...</i>

59:14.684 --> 59:17.244
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.378
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

59:19.522 --> 59:22.013
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

59:25.295 --> 59:26.990
Hey, hey, that is my life.

59:27.130 --> 59:28.722
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

59:28.865 --> 59:31.732
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

59:31.868 --> 59:34.462
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

59:34.604 --> 59:37.198
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

59:37.340 --> 59:39.103
You fuckin' want some?!

59:39.242 --> 59:41.904
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

59:43.546 --> 59:48.347
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

59:48.484 --> 59:51.510
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>Dicky was a street kid.</i>

59:51.654 --> 59:55.852
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.927
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.998
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:05.066
He's been doing this for years.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.328
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:16.368
- What do you think?
- <i>You think they set him up?</i>

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.605
What do you think he was doing?

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:22.149
<i>You know, gave him money,</i>
<i>gave him drugs for the movie. Right?</i>

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:29.117
<i>Micky... Micky?</i>

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.687
<i>Shit. Micky...</i>

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.656
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:52.029
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.864
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.330
It's like a beach ball.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.524
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.222
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:33.301
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.462
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:40.372
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:44.240
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.314
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.314
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:55.019
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.625
But I'll only do it on one condition.

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:03.690
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:07.098
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.898
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.337
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:15.342
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:18.743
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.510
- Yeah. You laugh.
- <i>You...</i>

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:25.849
...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.926
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.391
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.860
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:37.261
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.527
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.296
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:44.099
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.606
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.209
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:52.508
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.173
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.878
- Why can't you trust anybody with...?
- I know people.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.648
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.758
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:06.555
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.561
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:11.292
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.595
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:16.432
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:19.370
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:22.671
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.007
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.138
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:31.083
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.881
I don't want
another word outta you.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.614
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:38.022
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.787
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.898
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:45.830
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.903
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.437
<i>You're gonna get Charlene involved?</i>

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:54.134
<i>- Is that what you're telling me?</i>
<i>- I know where she lives.</i>

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:55.743
<i>What are you pickin' on her for?</i>

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.779
<i>She lives in that</i>
<i>yellow house on Stevens Street.</i>

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:01.405
<i>I'm gonna go talk to Micky,</i>
<i>sort this out for myself.</i>

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:06.647
<i>Yeah, sure. You go handle it</i>
<i>with your vigilantes. All of yous now.</i>

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:07.881
<i>This is wrong, Alice!</i>

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.762
I got it!

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.696
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.200
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.802
Get in the car.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.429
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.055
Micky!

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.767
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.429
Where are you?

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:01.443
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.603
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.342
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.122
Hi.

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.992
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

01:08:23.131 --> 01:08:24.258
Look at what?

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.465
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.129
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.706
What are you doing, Mickster?

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.242
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:39.040
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.581
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:45.981
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.682
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:51.224
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.955
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

01:08:55.096 --> 01:08:57.497
I'm his mother. And his manager.

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.930
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.866
I'm not gettin' any younger.

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:03.938
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:07.564
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.111
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.112
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:16.013
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.676
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.926
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.362
Let her go!
Let her go!

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.461
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:38.437
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.474
- Skank!
- Micky...

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.246
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:48.475
What'd she do to your nose?

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.320
What is happenin'
What is happenin' to everybody?

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.758
I don't understand, sweetheart.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:49.709
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.312
'Cause I don't.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.745
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:58.111
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.279
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.982
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:07.118
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:12.558
Hey. Good luck.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:25.845
That's it!

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:31.843
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.234
<i>Visit for Dick Eklund.</i>

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.604
Dicky!

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.110
Eklund, you got a visitor!

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:09.410
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.451
I know you know what I been doing.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:14.317
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:17.084
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.662
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.787
It's all good.

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:26.230
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:27.960
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:32.062
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.141
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.642
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.873
They don't care if he kills you.

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:44.543
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:49.386
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:53.052
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:55.493
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:59.362
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.470
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.401
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.338
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:09.774
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.403
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:15.176
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:18.684
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:22.086
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.953
I finally got a good thing going for me

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.822
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.093
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:33.827
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:36.529
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:38.663
Yes, you are.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.866
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:44.240
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:45.812
Two minutes, Dicky.

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.314
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:52.216
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:56.154
Hey... Mick, what is it?

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.623
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.785
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:02.556
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.563
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.796
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.031
He's weak against the overhand right.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.574
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:16.735
Fuck you, Dicky.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:20.041
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:22.241
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:25.148
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:27.221
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.983
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:30.819
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:34.417
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:37.123
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.367
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.273
He knows I'm right.

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:55.249
<i>Ward's record: 29 wins,</i>
<i>seven losses so far, 20 KOs.</i>

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.717
<i>He's been a little better since</i>
<i>he refocused himself on the sport,</i>

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:00.378
<i>as JB pointed out.</i>

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:10.422
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:15.697
<i>You see the record: 16 wins,</i>
<i>15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.</i>

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.600
<i>There's Mike Toma,</i>
<i>the promoter of the fight,</i>

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.366
<i>who has a lot invested in Sanchez.</i>

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.135
And he says that Sanchez is

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:25.576
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:39.784
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.624
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.790
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:48.198
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.999
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.232
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.400
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:58.768
You can see his power.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.973
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.050
How about taking points away from him?

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:06.019
<i>Larry, unless</i>
<i>the referee does, you can't.</i>

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.678
<i>The referee should just go</i>
<i>ahead and stop this fight.</i>

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:11.350
<i>He knows that Micky doesn't want</i>
<i>to be here. I wouldn't even make...</i>

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:13.586
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.822
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:19.593
<i>Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.</i>

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:21.726
<i>Doing that same old shit.</i>

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:24.202
<i>They never seen such</i>
<i>an embarrassing performance.</i>

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.432
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.270
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:31.277
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.005
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:36.208
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.717
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:40.082
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:42.747
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:45.223
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.988
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.256
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.332
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:53.627
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.997
Come on, get your punches up...

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.367
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.701
Then you gotta do something, baby.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.502
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:04.703
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:05.904
All right, Micky.

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.984
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:13.884
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:17.014
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.457
Ward tying Sanchez up.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:21.425
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:22.894
Come on, Micky, come on!

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.864
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.265
to change Sanchez's mind...

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.098
And he's beginning to open up.

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.798
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:34.408
and throw against a fighter...

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.567
Time!

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.043
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:41.146
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.588
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.990
Good boy!

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.623
He's down on an uppercut!

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.326
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
...three, four, five...

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:05.736
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:08.843
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:10.877
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.771
Come on, head, body, head.

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:18.108
This is not professional.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.016
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:23.181
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:26.317
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.360
That was a good body shot by Ward.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.989
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.295
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:38.538
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:42.769
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:45.812
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.847
...nine, ten!

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.750
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.886
Oh, Micky won!

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.829
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:07.992
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.764
<i>A brilliant win in the career</i>
<i>of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.</i>

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:14.205
<i>Unbelievable defeat</i>
<i>at the hands of Micky Ward,</i>

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:18.779
<i>who had all but given away the first</i>
<i>half-dozen rounds of the bout.</i>

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.041
I think what Micky did was he recognized

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:22.980
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.916
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:28.045
Theater of the unexpected.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.556
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.159
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.753
You can't make it up, folks.

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:36.386
You hear what he said?

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.226
He said, " You can't give up
in this game."

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:41.301
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.165
and he went out and stopped it.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.501
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:49.508
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin'

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:50.872
This thing is over.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.946
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:55.709
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.216
They just wanted to get out of there.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:21:00.048
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.554
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.056
He just told me,

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.752
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:09.989
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:14.727
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.271
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:21.637
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:23.573
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.806
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.781
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.887
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.511
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:35.953
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.854
Where'd you get that?

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.358
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:40.927
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.087
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:46.291
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.267
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.304
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.902
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.977
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.511
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.138
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.709
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.583
He's not even gonna be there.

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:36.708
- Hey!
- Daddy!

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.876
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:42.149
Good to see you!

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:47.857
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:50.328
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:55.027
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:05.275
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:08.015
I got new teeth. Everything.

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:09.480
How you think I look?

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:11.744
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.726
Cake and more cake.

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:29.462
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:32.198
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:35.503
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.201
Quacka!

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:43.874
Ma.

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:59.857
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:06.604
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:09.266
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.436
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:20.254
How you doing, Dicky?

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.757
Let's spar.

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.433
Hey, Charlene.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:00.321
Welcome back!

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.124
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:10.093
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.900
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:17.410
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:21.343
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:24.884
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.955
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:33.525
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:37.153
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.925
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.427
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:58.013
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:05.323
You stickin' to that?

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:11.357
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:14.730
I don't know what else to say.

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:24.007
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:31.752
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:35.982
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:37.819
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.018
Mom, please?

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:42.493
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.063
I know. We'll see him at home.

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.753
- What the hell...?
- Would you please pack it up?

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.289
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.892
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.258
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:19.594
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:26.763
That's nice. That's nice.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:28.375
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:30.443
Sherri, come on, stop it.

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.045
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.546
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:38.948
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.578
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.387
He don't want me to work with him.

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:46.618
What're you talking about?

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.820
That's not right.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:52.455
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.830
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:57.335
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.461
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:27:58.606 --> 01:28:00.198
Take 'em home.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.676
Why don't you ask Micky?

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.876
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.949
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:13.648
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:15.449
Hey, take him outside, all right?

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:19.991
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.323
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.953
Because it's true.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.562
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:28.726
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.771
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:35.474
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:38.101
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:41.477
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:45.246
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:46.546
He's a junk bag!

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.280
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.856
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.788
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:53.723
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.193
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.094
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

01:28:58.232 --> 01:29:00.860
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.401
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.903
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:07.064
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:09.676
Not you, not you, and not you.

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.046
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.705
I want Dicky back.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.215
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:20.753
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.648
It's not the deal we made, baby.

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:26.282
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:30.386
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.192
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:33.960
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.569
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:39.332
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.101
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:43.802
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:45.412
That's the way you love him?

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:47.571
- Charlene!
- Come on!

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.980
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.815
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

01:29:56.924 --> 01:29:59.415
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:05.426
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.666
Wanna spar with your brother?

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.471
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.507
Watching that for years, huh?

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.577
Micky, Micky!

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.245
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:29.651
Micky!

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.691
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.384
Take that baby out of here.

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:35.120
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:39.396
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:42.833
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:46.701
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:50.402
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.604
I know you think he's coming back.

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.647
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.478
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.745
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:01.684
- What are you sayin' sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:04.883
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:07.961
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.460
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:10.996
Come on, come on! George, please!

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.259
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:16.859
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.564
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:21.197
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:24.140
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:25.745
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.905
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.275
I am your mother.

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:33.711
Yeah, Ma.

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:40.254
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:42.555
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:48.100
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

01:31:53.908 --> 01:31:55.205
Dicky!

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.708
Stay with him.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:01.444
Dicky... Dicky!

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.979
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.648
Dicky, wait, come on!

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:15.922
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.327
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.353
Hey, Chan.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:55.558
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:58.938
Hey, Dicky's back!

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.665
Hey!

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:03.940
Look at you!

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:07.206
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:10.875
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.679
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.345
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:19.490
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.959
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:24.462
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.303
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:34.670
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:42.138
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.418
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.031
Charlene? It's Dicky.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:08.036
<i>Get off my porch,</i>
<i>you piece of shit.</i>

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:12.038
<i>How fuckin' dare you...</i>

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.675
<i>... cocksucker...</i>

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.609
<i>... fuckin'...</i>

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:21.385
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.422
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:26.617
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:29.093
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.788
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:34.560
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.431
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.401
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:41.770
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:45.811
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:58.119
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.459
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:06.759
Really, what makes you say that?

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:10.393
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.699
And you can't just
run away because of me.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.808
He don't deserve that. All right?

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.433
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:20.411
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.516
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.277
But I want you to think about something.

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:27.444
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:29.146
That in my time, I never had.

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:32.350
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:34.427
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.553
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:37.925
I came here to make things right.

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:39.464
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.866
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:48.134
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:51.608
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.771
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:56.644
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:58.183
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:01.117
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:05.650
All right. I drank too much.

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:07.852
I worked in a lot of bars.

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:10.987
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:13.498
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:20.137
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:25.337
What is that blue shit on your arm?

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:28.174
It's icing.

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:35.719
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.790
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:52.601
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.836
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.642
I will.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.978
Hey, Mick...

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:12.848
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:16.759
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.831
You were my hero.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.263
I was.

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:24.327
I was.

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.535
I'm sorry.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.237
You are?

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:53.251
There's a press conference downstairs.

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:55.686
Come on, let's go.

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:57.322
Spot of tea, mate!

01:38:57.464 --> 01:39:01.594
Neary: Ten stone... six pound.

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:12.303
Ward: Ten stone... six pound.

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:16.211
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:21.421
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:23.819
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:26.290
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:27.655
a much better fighter.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.462
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:32.064
Thank you guys for the shot.

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:36.295
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.870
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.100
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:44.506
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.135
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:02.524
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:08.295
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:13.398
I can't see!

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:18.276
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:23.508
<i>Goin' down the only road</i>
<i>I've ever known</i>

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:29.451
<i>Like a drifter</i>
<i>I was born to walk alone</i>

01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:34.351
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
<i>- I made up my mind</i>

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:39.797
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:45.604
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:50.470
<i>Going down the only road</i>
<i>I've ever known</i>

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:55.708
<i>Like a drifter I was born</i>
<i>to walk alone</i>

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.783
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:01.279
<i>I made up my mind</i>

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:06.988
<i>I ain't wasting no more time...</i>

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:13.228
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:16.768
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:22.900
<i>Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.</i>
<i>He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.</i>

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:27.805
<i>And now Ward awaits his</i>
<i>opponent, Shea Neary.</i>

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:32.749
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:35.514
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:38.489
who throws 70 punches per round.

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.721
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.796
a huge following here tonight.

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:50.226
Accompanied
by <i>Paint the Town Red</i> by The Mahones.

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:53.806
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:57.570
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

01:41:57.711 --> 01:42:01.545
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:06.085
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:08.620
...dream of fighting.

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:12.418
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:14.550
Seventeen KOs.

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:28.467
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:32.636
Both of ya... shake hands!

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:36.613
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.082
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:44.851
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.926
Ward is a long ways from home.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.789
Don't coast in a foreign country.

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.658
Well, the big challenge for Ward

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:53.789
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:57.495
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

01:42:57.638 --> 01:43:00.072
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:02.437
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.100
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:07.680
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:10.942
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:14.447
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:16.453
And a big uppercut by Neary.

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:18.820
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.893
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.393
jabbing here and there.

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:28.595
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:33.638
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:35.765
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

01:43:35.909 --> 01:43:38.434
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.478
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.583
They trade shots at close range.

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:47.318
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:52.790
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.120
How about that?

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.489
Break!

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:59.597
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:03.294
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:07.237
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.467
and beat him with volumes of punching.

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:12.704
<i>No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.</i>

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:20.017
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:23.520
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

01:44:23.657 --> 01:44:25.318
surer of what he wants to do.

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:28.121
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:30.162
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:31.423
than he is right now.

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:33.362
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.797
at what's going on now.

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:38.598
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:41.674
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:44.003
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:47.136
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:51.650
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:55.482
Punches like these make it seem...

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:58.985
...that it's now Neary's fight.

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.428
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

01:45:02.562 --> 01:45:04.996
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:10.659
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:15.298
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:18.707
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:21.405
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:25.109
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:28.412
Vicious body shots from Neary.

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:32.082
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.420
I don't know if he can, Jim.

01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:36.620
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:39.493
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:40.895
That ain't fuckin' it!

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:44.367
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:49.197
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.172
Ward is out on his feet.

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:56.282
Loser! Go back to America!

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:59.817
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:01.978
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:04.147
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:07.385
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:13.255
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.459
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:17.570
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:22.004
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:24.269
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:27.039
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:29.375
This is a survival mode...

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:33.316
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:35.011
Never had to win, did I?

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:38.318
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:41.450
For you, for me, for Lowell.

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:44.393
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.465
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.397
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:50.560
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:52.604
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:55.765
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:58.878
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:00.604
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

01:47:00.747 --> 01:47:02.305
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:05.111
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.049
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:14.187
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

01:47:14.327 --> 01:47:17.091
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:19.790
he'll just get totally wiped out.

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.594
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:27.701
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:30.435
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:34.079
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.841
Come on!

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:39.147
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:41.151
Neary continues to pound away.

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:49.393
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

01:47:49.529 --> 01:47:52.760
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:56.198
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

01:47:56.336 --> 01:47:58.395
He backs Neary off.

01:47:58.538 --> 01:48:00.335
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:02.942
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.068
"Come on, let's fight!"

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:07.009
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:09.445
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:12.279
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.387
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:16.853
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

01:48:18.358 --> 01:48:20.588
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:23.389
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:27.227
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:29.927
First time in 23 professional fights

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.198
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.900
This is it, Micky!

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:39.102
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

01:48:41.581 --> 01:48:45.984
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:48.883
As Micky Ward pounds away!

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:52.719
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.827
Neary down for the second time.

01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:56.986
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

01:48:57.130 --> 01:49:01.533
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eighth-round TKO!

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:03.564
He's done it again.

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.566
He's done it again.

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:11.666
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:27.891
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:30.690
You fuckin' did it!

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:41.407
Oh, you're the best!

01:49:41.541 --> 01:49:46.137
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:48.537
I love you!

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:22.412
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

01:50:22.549 --> 01:50:26.485
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.882
- We.
- I tell ya...

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:30.285
- We.
- No, but hold on.

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:32.357
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.926
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:37.962
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:39.929
Handin' it down to him.

01:50:40.066 --> 01:50:43.558
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:47.264
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:19.233
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:24.702
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:28.007
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:31.615
It's been real, ain't it?

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:35.187
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:37.255
Just glad it's done, finally,

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:40.450
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:42.959
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:45.997
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:48.760
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:50.494
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.605
Peace, everybody.
