God, can you believe that
Trump hung himself in prison?

00:43.209 --> 00:48.715
I know! And that Chris Christie
lost all that weight.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.176
He still looks terrible, though.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.137
(knocking)

00:55.180 --> 00:57.807
-Oh, hey, Joe.
-Hey, Peter. If you have a sec,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.976
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.311
PETER:
Oh, boy, this is it.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.229
He wants me to have sex with Bonnie.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.732
Now, remember, Peter,
you can't say yes right away.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.525
You let him talk you into it.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.695
He's watching for that.
It's part of the dance.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.947
I will absolutely have sex with Bonnie.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.200
JOE:
Sorry, Peter, you're too eager.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.618
So, I came over to invite you

01:16.701 --> 01:18.620
to Susie's christening this weekend.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.581
-Oh.
-And I don't just want you to be a guest.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.501
I was wondering if you'd
be willing to be the godfather.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.670
-Godfather?
-Yeah, you're my best friend,

01:26.753 --> 01:30.048
and, well, I'd like you
to be Susie's godfather, too.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.676
-Godfather II?
-Wow, you're really warming to this.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.512
Well, you've made
two very compelling arguments.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.140
Perhaps we should discuss this
further in my poorly-lit den.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.060
So, about this offer...

01:42.143 --> 01:43.895
What are you guys discussing?

01:43.978 --> 01:45.730
And when did we get a den?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.440
Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather

01:47.524 --> 01:49.442
is closing the door in your wife's face

01:49.526 --> 01:51.528
while she wonders what's going on inside.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.613
But I just wanted to...

02:09.379 --> 02:11.589
PETER:
I forgot it was a swinging door.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.592
(bell tolling)

02:16.636 --> 02:19.389
(Italian accent):
DiGiorno. DiGiorno.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.057
Joe Paterno.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.517
DiGiorno.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.519
Damn it, Peter, being Susie's godfather

02:24.602 --> 02:25.812
doesn't mean you're in the mob.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.814
And you can't bring a cat to church.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.316
Why not? He's Cat'lic.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.735
(cat snickering)

02:31.818 --> 02:34.320
(giggles)
He does a Muttley laugh.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.864
Where's the priest?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.199
Oh, the church ran out of priests
months ago,

02:38.283 --> 02:39.701
'cause of all the diddlin'.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.995
Now they just have a rabbi fill in.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.204
Shalom, everyone.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.539
Welcome to the christening.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.416
Now, before the child goes in the water,

02:46.499 --> 02:48.710
has it been at least 20 minutes
since she ate?

02:48.793 --> 02:50.253
-Yes, Rabbi.
-Wonderful.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.130
Then let's dunk this kid like a doughnut.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.507
I hereby christen this child
in the name of Jesus Christ,

02:54.591 --> 02:56.134
who was killed by we-don't-know-who,

02:56.217 --> 02:57.469
it's not important.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.721
The last thing we want to do
is point fingers...

02:59.804 --> 03:01.806
Can you please take my daughter
out of the water?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.350
Sorry.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.226
Congratulations, sweetie,
you're a Christian.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.146
From now on, every Sunday
you get to eat a hard cookie

03:08.229 --> 03:10.440
and pretend it's a guy.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.487

03:18.907 --> 03:21.826
Coffee in the smallest cup
we have, as you requested.

-Grazie.
-And let me assure you,

03:23.620 --> 03:25.497
any shouting you hear from the kitchen

03:25.580 --> 03:27.957

GORDON RAMSAY:
Oh, disgusting!

03:30.043 --> 03:31.961
-(dish shatters)
-Scusi.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.048
Oh, God, here comes Doug.
He just got a race car bed,

03:35.131 --> 03:37.133
and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.261
Hey, Stewie.
Still sleeping in the slow lane?

03:40.345 --> 03:42.597
(forced chuckling)
Okay. Okay.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.974
So, your mom still taking you
to the ladies' room

03:45.058 --> 03:47.185
-to go pee-pee?
-Actually, yes.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.688
Yeah, me, too.
I don't like the men's room.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
All the urinals are at mouth level.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.776
I don't look at those.
I'm too busy fixing my hair

03:54.859 --> 03:57.195
in the mirror...
Oh! I'm sorry.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.947
Ciao, Stewie!

03:59.030 --> 04:00.448
God, that was humiliating.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.325
This party has turned south quick.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.328
Like Bryan Singer's remake of Casablanca.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.540
Here's looking at you, actual kid.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.417
Everyone, I'd like to say a few words.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.377
Uh, it's a very special day,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.587
as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ

04:14.671 --> 04:16.423
before she can consent to it

04:16.506 --> 04:18.842
or have any conception
of what's happening.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.594
Susie once licked a booger off my hand.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.513
-I'm Chris, by the way.
-Thanks, Chris,

04:23.596 --> 04:25.515
but let's wait
till we're called upon, bud.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.434
Anyway, thank you all for coming.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.768
And to the host.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.021
Joe, thank you for having us
in this restaurant

04:31.104 --> 04:33.940
with a painted wall
that makes Venice look terrible.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.859
OTHERS:
To Joe!

04:35.942 --> 04:37.110
Everyone, enjoy.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.945
Uh, for the kids, we've got games

04:39.029 --> 04:41.156
and also a party princess dressed as Elsa

04:41.239 --> 04:42.949
who's clearly a prostitute,

04:43.033 --> 04:44.701
but please don't proposition her here,

04:44.784 --> 04:47.454
just nod in her direction--
trust me, she'll get it.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.414
It's her profession.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.921
Oh, cool, they got a piñata!

04:57.005 --> 04:59.299
-Peter, it's for the kids.
-Like hell it is.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.301
I'm the godfather of this event,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.554
and I want a debilitating
wine-and-candy headache.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.556
Give me that, kid.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.558
I'm your son, you dick.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.560
Sir, please, you're making a scene.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.562
No, I’m not.
I can do whatever I want.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.147
I'm the godfather.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.524
Uh-oh.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.693
I'm-a so sorry, sir.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.372
-Godfather?
-There's a new godfather?
-Aw, look at the wall.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.291
Why does Venice always look-a so terrible?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.669
From now on, you eat on the house.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.964
You will be treated with
the utmost respect, Godfather.

05:40.048 --> 05:44.010
Grazie. Now please name
the menu item I ordered after me.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.679
The dinosaur chicken tenders?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.305
All right, we'll find something else.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.640
Thank you very much.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.434
Hear that, Doug?
My dad's now the godfather.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.061
And yours is...

05:53.144 --> 05:56.147
VP of Systems Integration or something?

05:56.231 --> 05:57.482
What was that, Stewie?

05:57.565 --> 05:59.818
I was invited
to sit at the first grade table.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.736
What?!
How'd you get that invite?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.363
Big D energy, Stewie.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.615
You either got it or you don't.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.617
Oh, yeah?
What does the "D" stand for?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.703
-Divorced?
-(others gasp)

06:09.786 --> 06:12.789
-Wh-What?!
-Stewie, my parents
are trying to make it work.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.000
-Gee, Stewie.
-They're doing their best.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.002
He ended things with the nanny.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.170
Not that it's any of your business.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.465
Oh, yeah.
Uh, g-g-g-good for them.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.509
Gene and Sheryl are wonderful people.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.178
I-I hope they make it work.
Good vibes. Healing.

06:27.262 --> 06:31.016
G-G-G-God bless you all.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.859
God, I can't believe Mike Pence
came out of the closet

06:40.942 --> 06:43.737
just before he hung himself in prison.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.325
-Bon Jovi, family.
-Morning, Dad.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.745
Are things gonna change
now that you’re a godfather?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.039
Good question, Chris.
And yes, quite a bit.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.916
I'll be touching faces
a lot more than I used to.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.378
My boys. My bambinos.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.047
No touch.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.382
And I'll be totally oblivious
to the affair

07:04.466 --> 07:06.468
between my bodyguard and my wife.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.304
You look very nice today, Vincenzo.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.306
Hey! She gave you a compliment.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.641
What, do you got cotton in your ears?
Answer her.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.102
Yeah, meathead.
What's with this guy, Pop?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.855
And as a mafioso,
I'll be doing more voice-overs,

07:18.938 --> 07:22.192
which will always begin
by naming everyone at the event.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.444
-What does that even mean?
-PETER: There we were at breakfast.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.529
It was me, Chris G.,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.448
Meggs, Lois Griff,

07:28.531 --> 07:29.616
Little Stew

07:29.699 --> 07:31.451
and Uncle Junior Grandpa Nephew,

07:31.534 --> 07:32.994
who was my cousin.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.913
It was one of those breakfasts
where you realize

07:34.996 --> 07:36.664
you put on your boxers the wrong way

07:36.748 --> 07:38.625
and you need an excuse to leave the room.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.170
-We're out of syrup.
-I'll get it. You stay here.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.297
And will you be a stricter dad now?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.091
Interesting question.
My value system

07:46.174 --> 07:49.094
will vary wildly
between incredible immorality

07:49.177 --> 07:51.262
and intense social conservatism.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.556
Dad, there's a shipment
of heroin in our driveway.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.768
-Excellent.
-I watched a PG-13 movie last night.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.937
In your mother's house?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.189
Now, everyone keep eating
until you throw up.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.775
What's this?
As a leader in the Italian community,

08:03.858 --> 08:07.529
I'll be getting very upset
about store-bought pasta sauce.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.155
Peter, what the hell?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.865
That was our Prego.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.451
Yeah, and prego means
"you're welcome."

08:13.535 --> 08:16.454
It's a very cocky name
for an average pasta sauce.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.290
The rest of this is just jokes,
but that's kind of a good point.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.084
Now, kids, before you go to school,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.461
let's discuss what you tell
your friends about me.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.338
That your fingernails are so filthy

08:25.422 --> 08:27.382
because you do scratchers all day?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.925
Never talk about the family business!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.635
Things are too hot here for you now.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.637
You need to go to Italy for five years.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.639
-What?!
-You're not safe here anymore,

08:34.723 --> 08:37.142
