WEBVTT

02:49.336 --> 02:50.504
<i>Margo.</i>

02:52.005 --> 02:53.215
<i>Are you watching?</i>

02:53.215 --> 02:54.716
Yeah.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.719
Yes. Yes, I am.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.695
Ladies and gentlemen.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.446
Please take your seats.

03:32.421 --> 03:38.343
The chair declares this special meeting of
the Mars Oversight Board to be in session

03:38.343 --> 03:42.764
with Irina Morozova presiding
on behalf of Roscosmos

03:42.764 --> 03:45.684
during the month of July 2003.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.105
All members are in attendance
and a quorum is present.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.983
Let us begin.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.976
<i>I'm looking forward
to finally meeting you in person.</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:50.327
Heigh-ho.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.707
- Hey.
- Hello.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.684
Hello.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.630
How's it hanging, Ilya?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.135
Well, hello, everybody.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.471
How y'all doing?

08:03.108 --> 08:04.401
Admiral.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.905
I don't know what to say.

08:08.655 --> 08:13.160
How about, "What'll you have, Admiral?"

08:14.077 --> 08:16.205
"What will you have, Admiral?"

08:16.205 --> 08:18.749
Thank you so much for asking.
I'll have whatever he has.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.042
Yes, sir!

08:29.468 --> 08:30.469
Cheers, everybody!

08:37.601 --> 08:38.769
That is some good shit.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.647
- Hit me again.
- Yes, sir.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.904
Factoring in the increased pace

08:48.904 --> 08:52.115
of flights and fuel refining
at Happy Valley,

08:52.115 --> 08:55.452
we're confident of being able to launch
an asteroid capture mission

08:55.452 --> 08:56.620
in eight weeks.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.208
That timeline is obviously tight
but we think it's doable.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.461
But for sake of argument,

09:04.461 --> 09:08.465
mission is successful,
asteroid enter the Martian orbit,

09:09.341 --> 09:12.386
next step will require
the developing a new equipment.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.971
- Uh-huh.
- Yes.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.931
In fact, we at Helios project a need

09:15.931 --> 09:21.270
to design, build and sustain a fleet
of 200 new microgravity rovers,

09:21.270 --> 09:25.232
capable of ongoing operations
in and around the asteroid.

09:25.816 --> 09:29.653
We also need to design, build
and sustain two orbital platforms

09:29.653 --> 09:31.697
as a base of mining operations,

09:31.697 --> 09:36.451
along with 45 new MSAM hoppers to
facilitate personnel and cargo transfers

09:36.451 --> 09:39.204
between the expanded Happy Valley facility

09:39.204 --> 09:41.874
<i>and two dozen massive cargo haulers</i>

09:41.874 --> 09:44.751
<i>with nuclear fusion reactor-powered
ion drives</i>

09:44.751 --> 09:47.880
to transport the iridium to Earth.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.715
- We've--
- Forgive me for interrupting,

09:49.715 --> 09:53.427
but this is an enormous expansion
of research and development

09:54.344 --> 09:56.722
beyond anything the world
has ever attempted.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.058
By my count, you're saying
we need to construct

10:00.058 --> 10:04.646
six new types of spacecraft,
over 400 individual vehicles.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.899
- Is that correct?
- Not exactly.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.403
This is only page 1
of the vehicle requirements.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.491
What are the total numbers?

10:16.491 --> 10:19.912
We project a need for 11 new spacecraft

10:21.622 --> 10:24.499
and 2,500 individual vehicles.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.838
<i>Those are conservative numbers.</i>

10:29.838 --> 10:32.341
I was guessing closer to 4000 vehicles.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.469
<i>Well, this will be an enormous expense.</i>

10:37.095 --> 10:40.599
Plus, the capital investments
to expand Happy Valley itself,

10:40.599 --> 10:43.810
increased personnel,
training, maintenance.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.397
<i>And she hasn't even gotten to building
the receiving and processing facilities</i>

10:47.397 --> 10:49.483
we're gonna need in low-earth orbit

10:49.483 --> 10:52.611
for when all the iridium deposits
start arriving back home.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.408
Ms. Rosales,

10:59.159 --> 11:03.455
what is the top-line number
for total investment in this project?

11:05.082 --> 11:10.587
For Helios to create the infrastructure
needed for basic mining operations

11:10.587 --> 11:13.924
after the asteroid is captured,

11:13.924 --> 11:17.636
we will require
a minimum capitalization cost of...

11:19.680 --> 11:20.973
two trillion dollars.

11:25.477 --> 11:29.523
But the asteroid is worth
at least 20 trillion, probably more.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.233
So it's a solid investment.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.707
Is this for real?

11:46.707 --> 11:48.292
It's certainly ambitious.

11:49.001 --> 11:52.045
Twenty-five flights
in the first month alone?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.506
- That's nearly once a day.
- And take a look at the estimate

11:54.506 --> 11:56.842
for how much fuel we'll need to refine
just to grab it.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.720
Jesus fucking Christ.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.265
Sorry.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.641
Holy fucking shit.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.018
Much better, XO.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.480
Look at the timeline
for equipment fabrication.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.151
Skipper, we've never come anywhere close
to this pace of operation.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.528
I don't think we can pull this off.

12:23.202 --> 12:25.037
I was sent here to prove

12:25.037 --> 12:28.999
that this base was worth the years
of blood and sweat and tears it took

12:28.999 --> 12:30.626
to establish a Mars operation.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.297
Good people died up here,
and I knew some of 'em.

12:35.923 --> 12:40.010
Now is our chance to show that
their sacrifice wasn't in vain.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.097
So if the M-7 signs off on this plan,
then sends us after that rock,

12:44.097 --> 12:45.682
I'm gonna get it.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.768
I'm gonna get it or die trying.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.647
Aye, aye, skipper.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.735
Who told you?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.487
Nobody told me.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.739
See, I got a nose
for these kind of things.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.242
Shit, you think you're
the first smart guy who figured out

13:03.242 --> 13:06.495
how to build a still out of
scrap metal and cast-off parts?

13:08.163 --> 13:12.918
I've had moonshine on carriers,
cruisers, mass units,

13:12.918 --> 13:19.550
isolation chambers, jail cells,
churches, moon bases and space stations.

13:19.550 --> 13:24.888
If there's a still,
Ed Baldwin is going to sniff it out.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.350
Okay.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.518
But I'll tell you one thing.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.312
You need to switch out your filters
in your condensation line.

13:32.312 --> 13:37.317
That's why you got
that aftertaste of cinnamon mouse-ass.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.363
It's a telltale sign.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.743
Cinnamon mouse-ass?

13:46.743 --> 13:47.828
Yeah.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.710
I talked to the AFL-CIO rep
down in Houston.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.379
He said we have
a ton of leverage right now too.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.007
I don't know, a union?

14:01.425 --> 14:04.094
Remember when they tried
to unionize the miners at Jamestown?

14:04.094 --> 14:05.846
No, no, this is different.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.098
They can't just shitcan us, right?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.184
And then fly in a bunch of scabs
in two days?

14:10.184 --> 14:11.268
They can't do it.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.896
It's three months before they get
the replacements to Mars. Minimum.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.772
By that time,
Goldilocks will be long gone.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.441
If we don't band together,

14:17.441 --> 14:20.110
they're just gonna keep screwing us
every chance they get.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.405
I'm telling you, we're all gonna be
pulling double shifts, triple overtime,

14:23.405 --> 14:26.825
working meal breaks, no R and R days,
a recipe for fucking disaster.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.577
Earning bonuses, double bonuses,

14:28.577 --> 14:30.078
- probably double secret bonuses...
- What?

14:30.078 --> 14:31.163
- ...along the way.
- Yes.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.916
People get tired. They lose focus.
They make mistakes.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.168
- And this is when people get hurt.
- Exactly.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.754
You gotta take some risks
if you want a big payoff.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.924
What are you gonna do with
all that money if you're dead?

14:41.924 --> 14:44.134
At least I'll die with a rich man's smile.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.366
She seems very confident.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.117
<i>Well. With good reason.</i>

15:09.701 --> 15:12.913
She knows Helios has never been
more essential to us and the Americans

15:12.913 --> 15:14.248
than they are now.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.001
<i>Us? I like hearing you say this, Margo.</i>

15:20.087 --> 15:23.257
- I wasn't--
- Okay. Let us see what they're made of.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.181
Administrator Hobson, Ms. Rosales.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.934
On behalf of Roscosmos
and the Soviet Union,

15:33.934 --> 15:35.435
welcome to Leningrad.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.689
- Thank you.
- Pleasure to be here.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.024
My hotel is magnificent.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.443
And how are your accommodations,
Ms. Rosales?

15:44.528 --> 15:47.030
Would be more comfortable
if the bathroom wasn't down the hall.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.866
Well, with the large size
of the conference,

15:48.866 --> 15:53.078
we were forced to put some in
less than ideal accommodations.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.288
To success.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.664
Not sure how that's possible,

15:55.664 --> 15:58.667
unless we find a trillion dollars
under someone's mattress.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.503
<i>Well, the problem isn't the money.</i>

16:01.503 --> 16:02.713
- It's not?
- No.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.174
<i>Our two nations alone could
put up that amount of money.</i>

16:05.174 --> 16:06.884
<i>And we will not, of course.</i>

16:06.884 --> 16:07.968
<i>Yes, we will not,</i>

16:07.968 --> 16:12.848
<i>because it is the responsibility of the
entire M-7 bloc to fund this operation.</i>

16:12.848 --> 16:15.934
<i>I mean, everybody has to have
skin in the game if they want to benefit.</i>

16:15.934 --> 16:17.019
And believe me,

16:17.603 --> 16:20.105
there is plenty of skin in this room
to cover the costs.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.982
Then what's the problem?

16:21.982 --> 16:24.776
The problem is the return on investment.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.945
ROI.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.072
The biggest three letters in business.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.908
- In any language.
- I get it.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.329
<i>And there is a substantial return
on everyone's investment.</i>

16:35.871 --> 16:41.293
The cost is 10% or less of the potential
revenue of over 20 trillion dollars.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.837
It's a huge ROI.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.797
But not for 30 years.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.925
Thirty years at minimum.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.178
My people estimate it's closer to 40 years

16:51.178 --> 16:55.599
<i>before any of our countries will see
the return on this investment.</i>

16:55.599 --> 16:58.227
I said 35 years was more realistic.

16:58.227 --> 17:02.356
I can't wave a magic wand
and create entire new fleets of spacecraft

17:02.356 --> 17:04.483
and their associated infrastructure
out of thin air.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.569
And even after it's built,
we still have to launch those systems

17:08.569 --> 17:12.281
to a planet that's
30 days' travel time away on a good day.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.077
And then we have to
actually mine the stuff

17:15.077 --> 17:17.538
and-- oh, yeah--
bring it all the way back home.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.455
It takes time.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.544
Well, unfortunately,
you're making our case for us.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.005
What case?

17:27.005 --> 17:28.757
To drop the entire operation.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.927
- What? No!
- No. No, no, no.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.721
This is literally
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.056
We can't pass this by.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.643
Moscow will never agree
on waiting four decades

17:39.643 --> 17:43.272
before seeing real benefits of
the investment this significant.

17:43.272 --> 17:47.234
But the whole point of the project is that
it's not just for us today.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.318
<i>It's for the future.</i>

17:48.318 --> 17:50.195
No, it'll never fly in Washington either.

17:50.195 --> 17:52.906
Forty years is a lifetime in politics.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.159
Think about it, 40 years ago,
Jack Kennedy was president,

17:56.159 --> 17:58.495
the Vietnam War was
on the news every night,

17:58.495 --> 18:00.122
and Elvis was skinny.

18:00.873 --> 18:05.127
Millions of people, generations of people
who haven't even been born yet

18:05.127 --> 18:06.670
will be affected by this.

18:08.297 --> 18:13.468
We have a unique chance to do something
that will benefit the entire Earth.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.930
Unfortunately,
Goldilocks is not going to Earth.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.015
It's going to Mars.

18:18.599 --> 18:22.352
And the only people who stand
to benefit from it is you at Helios.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.979
You get the money for investment now,

18:23.979 --> 18:25.898
and then we have to
wait for the benefit later.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.192
- No, it will not do.
- Hold on a second there.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.195
What if Goldilocks wasn't going to Mars?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.280
We never modeled that scenario.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.782
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

18:35.782 --> 18:37.784
- That's why we're here.
- Wait, wait.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.328
He might be onto something.

18:39.328 --> 18:41.038
<i>Explain what you mean.</i>

18:43.248 --> 18:47.753
Bringing the asteroid to Earth
instead of Mars.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.838
Mining it in orbit. Here.

18:52.299 --> 18:56.178
Using the existing helium-3 infrastructure
from the Moon

18:56.178 --> 18:59.431
would allow us
to start mining it right away.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.142
And not having to send
thousands of vehicles to Mars

19:02.142 --> 19:03.352
means a faster timeline.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.938
And an exponentially faster
return on investment.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.190
To everyone.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.235
And it opens the door for other companies
to make money mining it.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.611
Not just Helios.

19:12.611 --> 19:15.239
The potential for the global economy
is staggering.

19:15.239 --> 19:18.283
And instead of having to wait
to see benefits till the 2040s,

19:18.283 --> 19:20.202
<i>we start seeing them-- When?</i>

19:20.202 --> 19:23.038
Five years.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.041
I was just gonna say that.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.751
My fellow delegates,

19:28.418 --> 19:30.712
I think we might have just changed
the rules of the game.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.051
<i>Now we just have
to figure out how to pull it off.</i>

19:38.011 --> 19:40.806
You see, if the vapor pressure
above the condenser's too high,

19:40.806 --> 19:43.892
steam is gonna fill the line down there.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.604
Okay. I'll make
the appropriate adjustments.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.689
You should.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.774
And you get drinks on the house.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.942
You're goddamn right I do.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.111
You think you can get all
this advice just for free?

19:54.611 --> 19:56.446
You keep them coming.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.291
- One more?
- Keep 'em coming!

20:07.291 --> 20:09.042
You drink like a Russian.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.004
I'll take that as the compliment
I think it was intended.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.510
Quite an operation you got going here.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.682
Between this and the black-market stuff
you got rolling in from Earth,

20:23.682 --> 20:27.352
you gotta be clearing, what,
five, ten grand a month?

20:27.352 --> 20:30.272
- Admiral, please.
- This isn't my first rodeo.

20:30.272 --> 20:34.234
I've seen black-market stuff
on carriers and cruisers

20:34.234 --> 20:36.069
- and MASH units, isolation--
- Admiral, please.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.488
This is not topic for here.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.948
So, how do you work it?

20:42.117 --> 20:44.244
You got someone helping you up on Phoenix?

20:47.873 --> 20:50.417
That's the only way
to really make it work.

20:50.918 --> 20:51.960
Right?

21:06.225 --> 21:07.518
Hey, Faiza.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.102
Miles. Hello.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.189
I'm gonna need a couple of extra slots
on the next obsidian shipment out.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.775
Weight's gonna be an issue,
'cause it's kind of a heavy consignment,

21:14.775 --> 21:15.901
but I figure if we move around

21:15.901 --> 21:17.986
- those last couple of--
- I cannot help you anymore, Miles.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.821
Excuse me?

21:19.821 --> 21:22.699
This area is off-limits
to nonessential personnel.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.203
And you, my friend,
are nonessential from this day forward.

21:27.663 --> 21:28.664
What's going on?

21:28.664 --> 21:30.499
Has the new XO
changed up security protocol?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.668
No. Palmer's got nothing to do with this.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.295
Sorry.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.882
Faiza. Where you going?

21:40.509 --> 21:42.302
Hey, let's talk about this.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.012
Hey!

21:45.097 --> 21:46.640
Nothing to talk about.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.226
Petros. Hey.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.817
- You are no longer welcome here.
- What's going on?

21:56.817 --> 22:00.737
Loading dock is now closed
to you and your rocks.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.031
As are all other aspects
of Ilya's business.

22:03.031 --> 22:05.200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It's just a misunderstanding.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.954
- I just gotta talk to Ilya--
- You will not talk to Ilya anymore.

22:08.954 --> 22:11.039
But he can't just shut me
out of the whole system.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.624
Man, I'm the reason this whole operation--

22:12.624 --> 22:13.709
Hey, hey, hey!

22:14.877 --> 22:18.172
You do not fuck with Ilya's business.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.423
Okay.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.758
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.094
Do not come here again.

22:39.985 --> 22:40.986
Fuck.

23:02.966 --> 23:06.303
The main problem is that dragging
something of that mass to Earth

23:06.303 --> 23:08.096
could take centuries.

23:09.640 --> 23:15.354
Kronos was a fraction the size of 2003LC,
and the spin rate was still a problem.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.731
During the '90s, NASA used DART

23:17.731 --> 23:21.401
to successfully simulate
asteroid impact avoidance techniques.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.321
<i>We might be able to use DART
to steer Goldilocks.</i>

23:24.905 --> 23:29.826
NASA during '90s used BART to simulate
asteroid impact avoidance techniques.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.329
- This could be of use now--
- DART.

23:32.329 --> 23:34.581
- I'm sorry. Who's Bart?
- DART.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.750
That's what I meant. Sorry, my English...

23:37.793 --> 23:38.794
<i>What's DART?</i>

23:38.794 --> 23:40.796
<i>Double Asteroid Redirection Test.</i>

23:40.796 --> 23:42.506
<i>Right. Right.</i>

23:42.506 --> 23:44.383
NASA tested eight techniques

23:44.383 --> 23:48.762
for deflecting extinction-level asteroids
or comets away from Earth in the '90s.

23:48.762 --> 23:50.097
<i>One of them might be applicable.</i>

23:50.097 --> 23:53.892
NASA tested eight techniques
deflecting asteroids

23:53.892 --> 23:55.978
during the DART program.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.106
So you stole that data too?

24:00.148 --> 24:01.733
We didn't steal anything.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.820
Really? Like to talk about
the NERVA engine design?

24:05.737 --> 24:07.573
This doesn't seem useful.

24:09.408 --> 24:10.409
Sorry.

24:12.202 --> 24:13.453
Please go on.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.623
Tell me about our eight techniques
and how useful they might be today.

24:17.207 --> 24:21.461
NASA openly published those tests
in scientific journals.

24:21.461 --> 24:25.007
NASA doesn't do its work in secret
like some police state.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.679
Your loyalties are misplaced.

24:31.263 --> 24:34.516
You don't work at NASA anymore.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.477
So your duty should be
to your current employer.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.690
I'm aware of my situation,

24:42.691 --> 24:44.693
- and who my duty is to.
- Furthermore,

24:44.693 --> 24:47.779
the DART tests
were published for all to see.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.699
- Right.
- Let's-- Let's refocus, please.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.619
One of the techniques from those tests

24:53.619 --> 24:56.622
did prove viable
during the Ranger 1 tests.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.791
Direct engine attachment
for remote propulsion.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.460
That was a viable option?

25:01.460 --> 25:05.464
Strap a rocket engine
to an asteroid and fire it up.

25:05.464 --> 25:07.007
<i>That wasn't in the Ranger 1 report.</i>

25:07.007 --> 25:09.051
We didn't see it in the Ranger 1 report.

25:09.051 --> 25:12.804
We moved away from it because of
misplaced faith in porosity measurements.

25:12.804 --> 25:15.224
Okay. So, what about
other redirection techniques?

25:15.849 --> 25:19.102
The other options were, if I recall,
ion-beam shepherding.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.104
<i>What about ion-beam shepherding?</i>

25:21.104 --> 25:24.066
<i>Not enough energy
to power a beam that big.</i>

25:24.066 --> 25:26.193
- Kinetic impact.
- Kinetikit impact?

25:27.110 --> 25:29.404
No time to build anything big enough,

25:29.404 --> 25:32.366
<i>and too hard to capture
another asteroid to slam into it.</i>

25:32.366 --> 25:34.326
- Nuclear explosives.
- No.

25:36.203 --> 25:37.538
What?

25:37.538 --> 25:42.084
I was just remembering
nuclear explosives option, but no.

25:43.877 --> 25:45.671
You guys were gonna nuke an asteroid?

25:46.880 --> 25:50.801
Hey, if the dinosaurs had nukes,
they might still be around.

25:50.801 --> 25:54.847
<i>But we're trying to steer Goldilocks,
not blast it into a million pieces.</i>

25:54.847 --> 25:57.349
<i>The other options were focused solar,</i>

25:57.349 --> 26:00.602
<i>mass driver, gravity tractor,
laser ablation--</i>

26:00.602 --> 26:02.104
- I know them all.
- That's true.

26:02.104 --> 26:06.024
Not enough power, not big enough,
too slow, doesn't exist.

26:08.944 --> 26:11.613
There's a solution here. I know there is.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.407
We just need to work
the problem for a while.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.951
Yeah. We must work the problem.

26:19.204 --> 26:20.205
Okay.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.166
Where do you want to start?

26:23.166 --> 26:24.418
<i>Let's start by reviewing</i>

26:24.418 --> 26:27.379
<i>the ion-beam collimation parameters
for shepherding.</i>

26:27.379 --> 26:30.132
<i>Because if we can focus
the divergence angles,</i>

26:30.132 --> 26:32.467
<i>we might be able
to generate enough thrust.</i>

26:32.467 --> 26:35.012
<i>If we combine those
with multiple kinetic impacts.</i>

26:36.096 --> 26:37.431
I need a break.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.266
Food?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.060
I'm starving.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.188
No.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.900
<i>There's a great restaurant
across the street.</i>

26:47.900 --> 26:49.109
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

26:49.109 --> 26:50.194
<i>Fantastic.</i>

26:50.194 --> 26:52.654
Wait. I-- I thought
we were working the problem.

27:32.402 --> 27:35.072
Don't mind if I do, Admiral Baldwin.

27:42.204 --> 27:43.247
Shit.

27:54.716 --> 27:55.801
Hold up.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.600
- What?
- Hey.

28:05.978 --> 28:07.437
Did I wake you?

28:08.021 --> 28:09.231
What, that a problem?

28:09.940 --> 28:13.902
No, it's just-- It's the middle
of the afternoon.

28:13.902 --> 28:16.321
Yeah, I guess I'm just a lazy fuck.

28:17.406 --> 28:18.407
That all?

28:19.658 --> 28:21.243
No. I need to publish

28:21.243 --> 28:23.996
a preliminary schedule of operations
for department heads,

28:23.996 --> 28:27.416
and I need you to sign off
on these base pay and bonus rates.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.543
Paperwork is your job now, Palmer.

28:29.543 --> 28:32.087
You're still the senior project manager.

28:32.963 --> 28:35.549
- Danielle shitcanned me.
- No.

28:35.549 --> 28:37.176
She removed you as executive officer,

28:37.176 --> 28:39.887
which means you're no longer
in the chain of command,

28:39.887 --> 28:42.264
but you are still
technically employed by Helios,

28:42.264 --> 28:46.810
which means you are still
a senior project manager for Happy Valley.

28:48.312 --> 28:50.314
Well, I guess you're right.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.481
Thanks for letting me know.

28:51.481 --> 28:54.610
- Bye now.
- Which is why I need you

28:54.610 --> 28:58.405
to sign off on
these base pay and bonus rates.

28:59.031 --> 29:00.032
For fuck's sake.

29:00.032 --> 29:03.619
Now, they come from Helios corporate,

29:03.619 --> 29:04.912
but I need your sign-off

29:04.912 --> 29:07.831
before I can publish
the integrated schedule for comment.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.542
Just need a signature.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.545
- This from corporate?
- Yeah, yeah. That's right.

29:13.545 --> 29:17.966
I just need you to sign the top sheet.
Right there.

29:17.966 --> 29:20.594
As senior project manager, I'll--

29:21.178 --> 29:23.055
- I'll take this under review.
- No--

29:23.055 --> 29:25.224
Come on, Ed, don't screw around.

29:25.724 --> 29:27.100
Goddamn it.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.398
I know we can get there.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.527
It's just another engineering problem.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.738
It can be solved.

29:40.697 --> 29:41.698
We don't have time.

29:43.492 --> 29:46.203
Soon the asteroid will be
out of our reach forever.

29:48.372 --> 29:49.831
We need to take some...

29:52.251 --> 29:53.335
bold action,

29:53.335 --> 29:55.796
'cause what we're doing right now
isn't working.

29:59.550 --> 30:00.843
So, what do you suggest?

30:03.303 --> 30:04.429
I suggest

30:06.265 --> 30:08.433
that Aleida and I work together on this.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.519
No. Absolutely not.

30:10.519 --> 30:15.023
If we do, I feel confident that
we will come up with a solution.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.693
She believes you are dead.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.987
She'll be upset. She'll be angry.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.447
Why would she agree to work with you?

30:30.956 --> 30:31.957
Because I know her.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.418
She's an engineer's engineer.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.755
And when she digs in on a problem,
she becomes obsessive.

30:40.674 --> 30:43.093
Same as me. It's in our nature.

30:43.927 --> 30:46.346
She might be upset with me.
She might hate me,

30:46.346 --> 30:49.766
but she will not be able to let this go
until she finds a solution.

30:51.727 --> 30:54.813
Right now, I guarantee you she's pacing
up and down in her hotel room,

30:54.813 --> 30:56.607
trying to crack this, same as me.

30:56.607 --> 30:59.735
She will be at it all night
and all day tomorrow. So will I.

30:59.735 --> 31:04.615
If we work together, we can pull this off.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.581
We must assume she will tell
the American government you're alive,

31:12.581 --> 31:18.170
and then Moscow will want
to announce your defection before they do.

31:18.170 --> 31:24.593
But do you understand that by doing this,
you're gonna unmask yourself to the world?

31:24.593 --> 31:28.847
That they're gonna call you
a spy, a traitor?

31:29.890 --> 31:31.183
I've considered that.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.479
So you're ready to be
the most hated woman in America?

31:36.647 --> 31:38.732
I don't relish the prospect,

31:40.025 --> 31:43.237
but I'm prepared to take that chance.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.243
Why?

31:49.243 --> 31:51.537
That's the only way to find a solution.

31:53.747 --> 31:54.915
Why, Margo?

32:00.587 --> 32:01.964
I don't want to hide.

32:04.216 --> 32:05.717
I don't want to hide anymore.

32:06.426 --> 32:07.928
I want to be a part of this.

32:07.928 --> 32:10.055
You are a part of this.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.767
Sitting in a back room
talking to you through an earpiece?

32:14.768 --> 32:16.436
My hands are tied behind my back.

32:21.441 --> 32:25.779
I think I should be in charge of
Star City's Goldilocks capture operation.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.074
Well, now we reach the truth.

32:31.493 --> 32:34.413
You want power... again.

32:34.997 --> 32:36.582
It's like a drug, no?

32:41.879 --> 32:42.880
My--

32:44.131 --> 32:48.385
My drug is the work, this work.

32:48.385 --> 32:51.305
Well, it will not make
any difference to these people.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.725
For them,
you're gonna be always a traitor,

32:55.559 --> 33:01.148
and no one will trust you here... or there.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.027
I don't care what people think of me.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.988
I know what I did
in the past and why I did it.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.284
And I know why I'm doing this now.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.206
And that's all that matters.

33:59.248 --> 34:00.290
Hello?

35:00.392 --> 35:03.103
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

35:15.365 --> 35:16.491
Aleida.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.038
I know this is a shock.

35:22.664 --> 35:25.125
But I can explain.

35:28.462 --> 35:29.463
You're alive?

35:30.506 --> 35:31.757
Yes. Now if you'll just--

35:37.554 --> 35:39.223
I can't believe it.

35:44.561 --> 35:46.271
Oh, my God.

36:20.973 --> 36:24.059
This is not acceptable.

36:24.059 --> 36:26.144
Well, I didn't have
much choice in the matter.

36:27.855 --> 36:30.566
Will this impact my request?

36:31.567 --> 36:33.360
Well, I hate to tell you this,

36:33.360 --> 36:36.280
but Ilya hasn't been
completely honest with you.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.699
He never had any intention
of bringing your wife up here.

36:42.077 --> 36:44.830
This was agreement.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.625
Well, he was just stringing you along
to get your business.

36:51.295 --> 36:54.006
This is not acceptable!

36:54.840 --> 36:55.924
You're right.

36:58.135 --> 36:59.386
It makes me sick.

37:00.596 --> 37:03.348
Lee, I'm a man of my word.
I wish I could help you.

37:03.348 --> 37:08.270
I think I could help you get her up here,
but Ilya's cut me out.

37:17.779 --> 37:18.947
I will handle.

37:40.511 --> 37:44.014
So, after I knew Sergei and his family
had escaped to West Germany,

37:44.014 --> 37:45.682
and they were safe...

37:47.768 --> 37:49.102
it was time to go.

37:49.853 --> 37:54.608
I went downstairs
and I walked around MOCR one last time.

37:56.276 --> 37:59.530
Sorta... said my goodbyes.

38:00.864 --> 38:02.491
You were standing at the flight console.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.619
Then I went back to my office.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.413
And a little while after that,

38:09.414 --> 38:12.709
I went to the cafeteria loading dock
at the back of the building,

38:13.919 --> 38:15.087
met my contact.

38:15.671 --> 38:20.050
He put me in a car and we left for
Sugar Land Airfield, outside of Houston,

38:20.050 --> 38:21.844
where they had a jet waiting.

38:22.553 --> 38:27.182
We flew to Mexico, switched planes,
made a bunch of stops,

38:27.182 --> 38:30.602
I don't-- I don't even remember them all.

38:31.937 --> 38:33.564
Eventually I ended up...

38:35.274 --> 38:36.191
here.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.069
You defected...

38:41.405 --> 38:43.198
to the Soviet Union?

38:44.908 --> 38:46.326
I didn't have much choice.

38:46.326 --> 38:48.161
You could have told the truth,

38:48.954 --> 38:52.666
admitted what you'd done,
and dealt with the consequences.

38:52.666 --> 38:53.834
I thought about it.

38:56.044 --> 38:57.129
But prison?

38:58.505 --> 38:59.506
Leavenworth?

39:00.841 --> 39:02.050
For the rest of my life?

39:04.845 --> 39:07.347
Just for trying to do the right thing?

39:07.347 --> 39:08.599
The right thing?

39:10.517 --> 39:13.061
After all this time
you still think you did the right thing?

39:13.061 --> 39:16.231
I never shared anything
that could harm national security.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.566
I was very careful.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.738
- Sergei and I, we--
- You gave them our Mars engine design.

39:25.157 --> 39:29.494
- I didn't see any other choice.
- Stop saying that.

39:31.246 --> 39:32.456
Of course you had a choice.

39:32.456 --> 39:34.833
You had choices all along,
but you didn't take them.

39:35.417 --> 39:36.418
You weren't there.

39:36.418 --> 39:37.503
I was there.

39:38.712 --> 39:41.924
I was in the building
the day you ran off to Russia, remember?

39:43.550 --> 39:45.052
Yeah. I know.

39:45.052 --> 39:46.720
I don't think you do.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.139
Because while you met
your contact down in the cafeteria

39:49.139 --> 39:52.809
and then got on your private jet,
I was still on duty.

39:54.978 --> 39:56.063
Doing my job.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.441
And I wasn't the only one.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.861
It was a full house.
Everyone wanted to be there.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.405
And one minute

40:05.405 --> 40:07.908
I'm looking at the big board
tracking fuel consumption rates,

40:07.908 --> 40:08.992
and the next...

40:11.578 --> 40:15.832
I'm on the floor, my ears are ringing
and the room is filled with smoke.

40:18.627 --> 40:22.422
Five people killed instantly
in mission control.

40:23.215 --> 40:25.968
Fourteen more died of
their injuries later that day.

40:25.968 --> 40:28.595
Another 12 over the next few weeks.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.973
164 in the rest of the building.

40:31.557 --> 40:34.059
195 total.

40:35.727 --> 40:41.191
- Sharon Atkins, Bob Kipling, Molly Cobb...
- I know the names.

40:41.191 --> 40:43.694
Bill Strausser? No. He wasn't killed.

40:44.820 --> 40:45.821
He was lucky.

40:46.905 --> 40:50.450
They had to dig through three tons
of rebar and concrete to find him.

40:50.450 --> 40:52.202
But Peanut was lucky.

40:55.122 --> 40:58.000
He only had his pelvis shattered
and his spinal cord severed.

41:08.427 --> 41:09.970
I went looking for you.

41:12.431 --> 41:13.807
Soon as I could stand.

41:15.225 --> 41:18.687
Started walking through the building,
went to your office,

41:19.855 --> 41:22.065
pushed through the outer doors and...

41:24.985 --> 41:26.737
there was just open air.

41:28.572 --> 41:30.199
Like, for a moment, I thought,

41:31.950 --> 41:33.285
"I'm in the clouds.

41:34.369 --> 41:35.579
This is heaven.

41:36.205 --> 41:37.623
I must be dead."

41:39.374 --> 41:40.501
But it was just...

41:42.169 --> 41:43.879
the side of the building was gone.

41:45.756 --> 41:47.341
The whole side of the building.

41:50.219 --> 41:53.096
I don't know how long I stood there
thinking about heaven.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.974
And I hoped-- I hoped...

41:57.601 --> 41:58.769
and I prayed...

42:02.481 --> 42:04.149
that you were in heaven too.

42:06.735 --> 42:10.489
Someone-- some cop, or fireman,
or something. I still don't know who--

42:11.865 --> 42:14.952
Someone came and got me and took me out.

42:17.913 --> 42:20.123
And as I passed through the outer office...

42:22.167 --> 42:24.711
I saw them picking up Emma's body.

42:27.798 --> 42:28.799
She died.

42:29.967 --> 42:30.968
Right there.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.720
At her desk.

42:35.681 --> 42:36.682
At her post.

42:52.406 --> 42:53.657
For what it's worth...

42:56.034 --> 42:57.327
I wish I'd been there.

43:00.497 --> 43:01.623
At my desk.

43:03.750 --> 43:04.918
At my post.

43:12.843 --> 43:14.094
What do you want, Margo?

43:21.310 --> 43:24.438
You really think I'm gonna work with you
on this stupid asteroid?

43:24.438 --> 43:30.569
I think you know how big this
stupid asteroid thing is for all of us.

43:33.322 --> 43:34.823
It'll change the world.

43:38.076 --> 43:39.077
I'm not doing this.

43:47.461 --> 43:48.462
Aleida...

43:50.881 --> 43:53.842
you'll leave here, you'll go home,

43:53.842 --> 43:57.679
and you'll be tortured by the fact
that there was a solution to be had,

43:57.679 --> 43:59.223
and it was just out of reach.

43:59.890 --> 44:01.934
It'll eat at you and fester,

44:01.934 --> 44:03.894
and by the time
you finally get the solution--

44:03.894 --> 44:06.772
because you will get the solution,
you know you will--

44:06.772 --> 44:09.316
the window will have closed,
and it'll be too late,

44:09.316 --> 44:12.819
- and you will regret that--
- Don't act like you know me anymore!

44:13.403 --> 44:15.155
You don't know me anymore.

44:16.782 --> 44:18.450
I know all about regret.

44:20.327 --> 44:21.954
Believe me, I know all about it.

44:23.664 --> 44:28.168
About sleepless nights spent
going over and over things in the past

44:29.461 --> 44:30.587
that you can't change.

44:35.926 --> 44:39.596
I know that we can do this.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.267
We can solve this problem.

44:45.227 --> 44:48.939
And we can change
the course of human history...

44:51.525 --> 44:54.278
right now, tonight, in this room.

44:58.657 --> 45:00.033
Hate me if you want,

45:00.951 --> 45:03.328
but work the problem with me.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.575
Ion-beam shepherding won't work.

45:41.575 --> 45:44.036
The asteroid would skip
off the atmosphere.

46:12.189 --> 46:13.482
What happened to him?

46:13.482 --> 46:17.653
Broken arm, bruised ribs, collapsed lung.

46:19.196 --> 46:20.572
My God.

46:20.572 --> 46:23.033
These types of accidents will happen

46:23.033 --> 46:26.203
when you are working too many hours.

46:27.037 --> 46:28.205
Accident?

46:29.206 --> 46:32.000
This was not an accident, Doctor.

46:32.501 --> 46:35.671
Petros says
the hydraulic lifter malfunctioned.

46:55.148 --> 46:56.191
Milosh.

47:08.078 --> 47:09.663
What is this?

47:09.663 --> 47:13.417
You sent a man to put his hands
on my fucking throat. That's what this is.

47:14.251 --> 47:15.836
You went behind me.

47:16.336 --> 47:17.796
You lied to me,

47:18.589 --> 47:21.592
put everything I had at risk.

47:24.052 --> 47:26.221
I don't know you anymore, Milosh.

47:26.805 --> 47:28.307
I haven't changed, Ilya.

47:29.474 --> 47:30.726
Look around you.

47:30.726 --> 47:33.520
This whole place is
gonna be swimming in money.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.524
That's opportunity for everybody. That's
the kind of opportunity I can't waste.

47:38.066 --> 47:39.776
But I still want you to be part of it.

47:41.111 --> 47:42.196
"Part of this."

47:42.738 --> 47:44.907
I was the one who brought you in here!

47:44.907 --> 47:48.368
- Keep your voice down.
- I--

47:54.541 --> 47:56.627
Look, I know how much you like this bar.

47:57.878 --> 47:59.880
I know how much it means to you.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.465
So, you can come by anytime.

48:04.343 --> 48:06.178
You helped me when I needed it most.

48:07.638 --> 48:09.389
I won't ever forget that. I won't.

48:40.212 --> 48:42.673
Okay, yeah,
but there was also a 30% increase

48:42.673 --> 48:44.842
in accidents over the same period.

48:45.342 --> 48:47.386
Look at Roger last week, right?

48:47.386 --> 48:49.179
Or Petros earlier today.

48:49.972 --> 48:52.641
I don't know about you, but I don't think
lacerations, broken bones

48:52.641 --> 48:54.643
and second-degree burns are
ticky-tacky crap.

48:54.643 --> 48:55.727
It's a risky job.

48:55.727 --> 48:57.354
Yeah, what do you think is gonna happen

48:57.354 --> 49:01.024
when they increase shifts
and double up their operational tempo?

49:01.024 --> 49:04.695
Huh? It's risky now, yeah,
and that's what we signed up for.

49:04.695 --> 49:09.074
We're tough. But this Goldilocks thing,
it could be flat out dangerous.

49:09.074 --> 49:12.870
I'm telling you, people are gonna
keep getting hurt, maybe killed.

49:12.870 --> 49:15.330
All you're gonna do is get the
company riled up.

49:16.164 --> 49:19.334
- And then we're screwed.
- Oh, you're already screwed.

49:19.334 --> 49:20.752
This is a private meeting.

49:20.752 --> 49:23.714
Sorry for cutting in, but I thought
there's some things you need to know

49:23.714 --> 49:26.008
about these pay schedules
that you're counting on.

49:26.008 --> 49:27.092
What's he talking about?

49:27.092 --> 49:30.345
He's just stirring the pot
'cause he got canned as XO. Okay?

49:30.345 --> 49:31.513
Well, that is true.

49:31.513 --> 49:34.600
I am an old pot stirrer
from way back when, but...

49:36.727 --> 49:39.521
this one's shaken, not stirred.

49:44.443 --> 49:45.777
Never mind.

49:46.403 --> 49:51.325
Look, the point is Helios is changing
the way they calculate bonuses.

49:51.325 --> 49:53.327
- What?
- They can't do that. I signed a contract.

49:53.327 --> 49:55.370
- Can they do that? What are the numbers?
- Hold on.

49:55.370 --> 49:57.080
They're revamping the point system.

49:57.748 --> 50:00.918
Used to be you reached
the first bonus tier at 500 points, right?

50:01.418 --> 50:03.879
- Right.
- Now it's gonna take 5,000.

50:05.047 --> 50:07.341
The bonuses themselves have changed.

50:07.341 --> 50:10.135
First-tier bonus used to be $20,000.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.345
Now it's 5,000.

50:12.012 --> 50:13.347
Look, it's all right here.

50:18.018 --> 50:19.895
Shit, Sam was right.

50:21.772 --> 50:23.315
It's completely changed.

50:23.315 --> 50:24.441
They can't do that.

50:24.441 --> 50:26.610
They just did.
This new schedule's going out

50:26.610 --> 50:28.862
with the next integrated operational
planning document.

50:28.862 --> 50:31.406
- How can they do this?
- They can't do that because I've signed--

50:31.406 --> 50:34.493
- We can't let them get away with this.
- Of course they can get away with it.

50:34.493 --> 50:38.455
You know why? Because our contracts can
be altered at the company's discretion.

50:38.455 --> 50:40.582
This is what I've been telling you guys.
Look it up.

50:40.582 --> 50:44.127
It's all there in the 50 pages of
fine print we all signed in our contracts.

50:44.127 --> 50:45.212
She's right.

50:46.046 --> 50:49.216
They can change the terms of employment
whenever they want.

50:49.216 --> 50:52.719
My cousin's a lawyer.
We take them to court and we sue!

50:52.719 --> 50:54.179
You can't go to court.

50:54.179 --> 50:57.933
Disputes go to arbitration
and the company picks the arbitrator.

50:57.933 --> 50:59.268
Bottom line is

51:00.978 --> 51:02.145
y'all are screwed.

51:02.813 --> 51:04.648
And even more so now
that the M-7 announced

51:04.648 --> 51:07.234
that they're sending
this rock to Earth instead of Mars.

51:07.234 --> 51:10.487
So we'll only get a few months
of shit bonuses instead of years' worth.

51:10.487 --> 51:11.572
Correct.

51:14.491 --> 51:16.493
- What can we do?
- I think

51:17.995 --> 51:19.454
you should listen to Massey.

51:21.123 --> 51:22.124
Organize.

51:23.375 --> 51:24.877
Unionize.

51:24.877 --> 51:27.171
Send a message
to those pricks down on Earth

51:27.171 --> 51:29.506
that if they want that precious asteroid,

51:29.506 --> 51:31.800
they gotta pay the people
who do all the dirty work.

51:32.551 --> 51:33.802
And if that doesn't work?

51:34.344 --> 51:37.097
Well, then we shut this place down!

51:38.223 --> 51:39.224
- Yes.
- Okay.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.642
Yes.

51:43.770 --> 51:44.771
Strike!

51:45.647 --> 51:46.648
Strike!

51:47.274 --> 51:49.860
Strike! Strike! Strike!

52:18.263 --> 52:20.891
<i>Shock waves are
still being felt around the world</i>

52:20.891 --> 52:25.187
after Margo Madison, who was presumed
killed in the 1995 bombing

52:25.187 --> 52:28.106
of what was then called
The Johnson Space Center,

52:28.106 --> 52:32.152
was revealed to be alive
and living in the Soviet Union.

52:32.152 --> 52:35.989
At a press conference in Leningrad,
Ms. Madison read a prepared statement

52:35.989 --> 52:40.410
to the world press who had gathered
to cover the M-7 conference.

52:41.036 --> 52:42.788
I made the decision to...

52:44.581 --> 52:48.544
defect to the Soviet Union in 1995

52:49.711 --> 52:53.298
after many years of dissatisfaction

52:54.174 --> 52:59.179
and disappointment with both
NASA and the American government.

53:00.973 --> 53:06.186
The space program I joined in 1966
had changed over the years

53:06.186 --> 53:09.898
to value profit above human life,

53:09.898 --> 53:15.821
<i>and was more dedicated to spreading
