Yeah.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.750
I was afraid you would say that.

18:59.750 --> 19:00.833
(GUN CLICKS)

19:26.708 --> 19:27.708
(GUN CLICKS)

19:41.833 --> 19:43.125
(CLANKING)

19:55.458 --> 19:57.042
Ladies...

19:59.083 --> 20:02.083
I took the liberty
of crossing off my name in your book.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.958
I hold no grudges
for what you thought you had to do.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.792
Goodbye, James.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.292
We will take him to the Raft...

20:21.917 --> 20:23.875
Where he will live out his days.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.167
It would be prudent

20:29.250 --> 20:32.125
to make yourself scarce in Wakanda
for the time being, White Wolf.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.667
Fair enough.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.833
Hey!

20:47.917 --> 20:50.792
I may have another favor to ask of you.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.292
BOY: Come on.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you doing, man? Where you goin'?

21:02.833 --> 21:05.042
SAM: I'm goin' to see your grandfather.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.542
All right, he in the back.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.458
Thanks.

21:12.542 --> 21:14.333
-I'll be back there.
-Yeah.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.917
ELI: Check up, man.

21:19.583 --> 21:20.583
Oh!

21:26.167 --> 21:27.583
(SIGHS)

21:43.625 --> 21:45.208
That what I think it is?

21:47.125 --> 21:49.417
Mmm-mmm. Leave it covered.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.958
Them stars and stripes
don't mean nothin' good to me.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.917
I need to understand.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.625
You understand.

22:04.833 --> 22:07.208
Every Black man does.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.083
Whether you wanna deny it or not...

22:09.167 --> 22:11.208
Don't do that bitter,
old man thing with me.

22:11.292 --> 22:13.708
If you ain't bitter, you're blind.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.875
I don't get it, okay?

22:21.792 --> 22:23.500
What went wrong?

22:26.292 --> 22:29.375
I used to be like you,

22:29.458 --> 22:32.250
until I opened my eyes,

22:32.333 --> 22:36.042
until I saw men in the Red Tails,

22:36.125 --> 22:40.833
the famous 332 fight for this country,

22:40.917 --> 22:44.958
only to come home
to find crosses burned on their lawn.

22:45.042 --> 22:47.333
I'm from the south. I get that.

22:47.417 --> 22:50.583
But you were a Super Soldier like Steve.
You could've been the next...

22:50.667 --> 22:52.583
The next? What?

22:53.458 --> 22:54.458
Huh?

22:55.458 --> 22:59.208
Blonde hair, blue eyes, stars and stripes?

23:00.208 --> 23:02.833
The entire world's been chasing
that great white hope

23:02.917 --> 23:04.792
since he first got dosed with that serum.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.583
Steve did not put you in jail.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.333
ISAIAH: She died while I was in jail.

23:25.417 --> 23:30.458
They, uh, never let a single
one of her letters get to me.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.250
They locked 'em in this box.

23:35.292 --> 23:36.583
They told her I was dead.

23:38.250 --> 23:43.500
Yeah, and after a while,
she was gone, and, uh...

23:50.625 --> 23:51.625
(INHALES DEEPLY)

23:51.708 --> 23:52.708
Sorry.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.083
You wanted to know what went wrong?

23:57.583 --> 24:03.167
A handful of us got shot up
with different versions of that serum,

24:03.250 --> 24:06.167
but they don't tell us what it is.

24:06.917 --> 24:10.042
They tell us it's tetanus.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.667
They sent us on missions,

24:12.750 --> 24:16.000
even though the others weren't stable.

24:16.917 --> 24:20.042
Some of us started dying off.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.333
Then a couple of the boys
get captured on a mission.

24:25.708 --> 24:31.875
I heard the brass talkin'
about blowing the POW camp to hell

24:31.958 --> 24:33.083
to hide the evidence.

24:33.833 --> 24:37.167
But those were my men. My brothers.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.125
Not evidence.

24:40.333 --> 24:45.250
So I bust out of the facility one night

24:45.333 --> 24:47.417
and I brought them boys back.

24:48.042 --> 24:51.500
Not that it made a damn bit of difference.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.292
It wasn't long before it was only me left.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.333
And what did I get for saving their lives?

25:09.708 --> 25:13.875
For the next 30 years,

25:13.958 --> 25:17.917
they experimented on me,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.917
trying to figure out why the serum worked.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.250
There was a nurse.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.583
She took pity on me.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.792
Wrote up some fake reports, something.

25:34.875 --> 25:37.708
She had me declared dead.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.042
That's who gave me this.

25:55.375 --> 25:57.708
My God! (BREATH TREMBLING)

25:59.042 --> 26:02.333
Sam, I loved her so much.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.167
Mr. Bradley, um...

26:08.958 --> 26:12.042
We gotta do something.
We gotta tell somebody.

26:12.125 --> 26:16.000
No. Leave me dead. My name is buried.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.083
But the world's different now.
I know people.

26:19.167 --> 26:21.250
Man, that's why you're here?

26:22.708 --> 26:25.958
You think things are different?
You think times are different?

26:26.042 --> 26:30.167
You think I wouldn't be dead in a day
if you brought me out?

26:31.833 --> 26:37.125
You wanna believe jail was my fault
because you got that white man's shield.

26:40.042 --> 26:43.000
They were worried my story might get out.

26:45.208 --> 26:48.917
So, they erased me.

26:50.125 --> 26:51.125
My history.

26:52.583 --> 26:55.083
But they've been doing that for 500 years.

26:55.708 --> 26:56.708
(CHUCKLES)

26:59.417 --> 27:02.250
Pledge allegiance to that, my brother.

27:03.917 --> 27:09.917
They will never let a Black man
be Captain America.

27:11.833 --> 27:12.958
And even if they did,

27:13.667 --> 27:19.333
no self-respecting Black man
would ever wanna be.

27:47.583 --> 27:51.500
Sarah, I'm comin' home.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.792
SAM: Good job, guys.

28:16.833 --> 28:19.917
In about 10 years,
we'll have this thing fixed.

28:22.208 --> 28:25.208
Would be fun to take the boat out
one more time, before we sell it?

28:26.208 --> 28:27.958
There's a great spot in Grand Isle,

28:28.042 --> 28:30.625
your grandfather used to take me,
catch a lot of fish.

28:31.417 --> 28:32.917
But Mom said we can't sell it.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.375
SAM: What?

28:35.458 --> 28:36.667
It's too messed up.

28:37.292 --> 28:40.625
Mr. Dinh said he wouldn't buy it
'cause it cost more to fix.

28:41.625 --> 28:44.250
And then he said
something else in Vietnamese.

28:44.833 --> 28:45.917
BOY 1: Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

28:48.833 --> 28:50.292
SAM: Why didn't you say somethin'?

28:50.875 --> 28:52.583
I didn't wanna tell you last night

28:52.667 --> 28:55.292
when you were lookin' all sad puppy dog
in the rain.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.500
It was a rough day.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.208
You mean with Isaiah Bradley?

29:01.125 --> 29:02.417
And what they did to him.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
You wanna talk about it?

29:06.667 --> 29:07.667
No.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.625
I'm trying to figure out
what it all means.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.125
SARAH: Okay, well, I'm here.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.500
(SIGHS)

29:17.250 --> 29:21.625
But as far as the boat is concerned,
bottom line is, Mr. Dinh backed out.

29:22.917 --> 29:24.125
I don't know what to do.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.417
Parts alone on that thing are gonna eat up
most of what we get back.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.250
Listen to me. Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix the boat.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.875
(CHUCKLES) Aren't you supposed to be off
saving the world?

29:32.958 --> 29:34.458
Why are you back here bothering me?

29:34.542 --> 29:37.542
'Cause my family's well-being
is a part of the world.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.833
(SMACKS LIPS)
So you're waiting for a lead?

29:40.917 --> 29:46.125
And the government stepped in
and took control and kind of benched us.

29:46.208 --> 29:47.208
(CHUCKLES)

29:49.333 --> 29:50.417
SARAH: Oh!

29:50.500 --> 29:51.583
Hey, guys.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.792
Please make sure
Bennett and Elling each get one.

29:55.875 --> 29:56.917
-Okay?
-BOY 1: Okay.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.917
-All right. Bye.
-BOY 1: Bye.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.625
Have a good day at school, guys.

30:00.708 --> 30:01.708
BOY 1: Okay.

30:03.667 --> 30:06.958
Bennett and Elling's dad
cannot get up before noon.

30:07.042 --> 30:09.958
Kids keep showing up hungry,
but are too proud to ask for any help.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.708
And you're like Mom,
feeding every kid in the neighborhood.

30:12.792 --> 30:13.792
(CHUCKLES)

30:14.500 --> 30:16.875
How many people still owe Mom
and Dad something?

30:17.458 --> 30:18.958
All of them.

30:19.042 --> 30:20.333
All that's left, for sure.

30:22.167 --> 30:23.167
Hmm...

30:23.292 --> 30:25.917
It might be time
to call in a few of those favors.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.750
I'm gonna fix this damn boat.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.375
-Hey, it's Sam Wilson.
-WOMAN 1: Hi, Sam.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.708

from up the street.

30:38.958 --> 30:41.208

You remember my mom and dad?

What's happenin' with you, boy?

30:45.667 --> 30:47.667
SAM: I'm back in town,
that's why I'm calling.

30:47.750 --> 30:48.833
MAN: What you need?

30:48.917 --> 30:49.917
-Mr. Thurow.
-THUROW: Yes.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.333
SAM: Any chance I can ask a favor?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.208
WOMAN 2: Anything for the Wilson family.

30:53.292 --> 30:55.708

how we're gonna get it out.

We need some more guys for this.

-Thank y'all.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.250
MAN: Yes, sir.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.042
We still got a bit of usefulness in us.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.417
How do we get it off the truck?

Just dropping this off.

31:34.917 --> 31:36.583
You can sign for it and I'll go.

Well...

32:16.542 --> 32:18.375
I don't always think of it immediately.

I'm right-handed.

Think Karli's gonna throw in the towel?

I think she's gonna double down.

I don't wanna make it weird
for your family.

Just stay here.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.583

to Lemar,

35:06.042 --> 35:08.875
And, um, that guy...

35:10.333 --> 35:12.000
He's the one that killed our boy?

35:12.583 --> 35:13.583
Yes.

I would never let the person
who did that get away.

you enabled as the Winter Soldier,

it would bring you closure.
