WEBVTT

03:01.700 --> 03:02.792
Alex.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.295
Tod and George's
dad just called.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.206
He's picking you up
at 3:30 tomorrow.

03:08.373 --> 03:11.343
And the bus leaves the high
school for the airport around 5.

03:11.501 --> 03:13.503
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

03:13.920 --> 03:16.093
Whoa, Mom, Mom, Mom, you
gotta leave that on.

03:16.923 --> 03:20.848
Yeah, it's like the tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing or anything.

03:21.011 --> 03:24.857
So I figure it's gotta be on the
bag, or at least, with the bag.

03:26.141 --> 03:27.358
For luck.

03:27.517 --> 03:30.191
Where would you get a
nutball idea like that?

03:30.353 --> 03:31.696
I'm still here.

03:36.526 --> 03:39.496
So 17, on the loose.

03:40.155 --> 03:41.998
Senior trip with your
friends in Paris.

03:42.157 --> 03:44.876
Ten days in the springtime.

03:46.036 --> 03:47.629
Live it up, Alex.

03:47.787 --> 03:49.539
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

04:34.334 --> 04:36.302
Alex.

04:36.461 --> 04:38.088
Alex.

04:56.272 --> 04:57.865
The white zone...

04:58.024 --> 05:00.994
is for immediate loading and
unloading of passengers only.

05:01.152 --> 05:02.745
No parking.

05:02.904 --> 05:06.534
Yeah, I've been sitting
here for over an hour.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.452
Where are you?

05:08.618 --> 05:09.710
- Hey, Hitchcock.
- What?

05:09.869 --> 05:12.463
Let me give you a hand with this, man.
There you go.

05:12.622 --> 05:13.965
Carter, you dick.

05:14.124 --> 05:16.468
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

05:17.627 --> 05:20.301
- You left this on the bus.
- Oh, thanks.

05:20.463 --> 05:22.010
Come on, let's get
your stuff together.

05:22.173 --> 05:24.972
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

05:25.135 --> 05:27.854
- What are you doing?
- He's the man. The man.

05:28.012 --> 05:29.639
All right, you guys
got everything?

05:29.806 --> 05:31.900
Yeah, yeah. Dad, we're all set.

05:35.437 --> 05:37.485
Does that mean go?

05:38.940 --> 05:40.237
Don't know.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.995
Look, this is for both of you, all right?
Have a great time.

05:44.154 --> 05:45.155
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

05:45.321 --> 05:46.493
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

05:46.656 --> 05:47.828
- Alex.
- Yes?

05:47.991 --> 05:50.619
- You take care of them.
- I will.

05:58.918 --> 06:02.343
You know, I didn't think anything could
look worse than my yearbook photo.

06:02.505 --> 06:05.304
How do you think I feel having
to look at you all the time?

06:14.017 --> 06:15.985
- What the fuck does he want?
- Shh.

06:21.232 --> 06:23.451
"The airport does not
endorse solicitors."

06:33.661 --> 06:34.708
Death is not the end.

06:37.624 --> 06:40.047
It will be for you if
you harass my students.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.717
- Hare Rama.
- Fuck off.

06:48.551 --> 06:51.805
I have to ask you a few
questions this evening.

06:51.971 --> 06:53.439
Did you pack your bags yourself?

06:53.598 --> 06:57.603
Have your belongings remained in
your possession the entire time?

07:00.313 --> 07:01.405
Mr. Browning?

07:02.774 --> 07:04.492
Oh, yeah.

07:04.901 --> 07:07.905
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

07:21.584 --> 07:23.678
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

07:24.087 --> 07:26.761
September 25, 9:25.

07:27.549 --> 07:30.428
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

07:36.099 --> 07:38.193
- Because I looked at him.
- Are you sure?

07:38.351 --> 07:40.274
Lisa, wait up.

07:40.937 --> 07:43.065
No, it's okay.

07:43.231 --> 07:44.483
Fuck, that was good.

07:44.649 --> 07:45.946
Dick.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.111
- Hey.
- Hey, George, Dad said both.

07:48.278 --> 07:50.622
Both of us, all right, man?
Just give me some cash.

07:50.780 --> 07:53.078
Hey, hey, knock it off.

07:53.241 --> 07:55.369
- Excuse me.
- Catch.

07:55.535 --> 07:57.412
You asshole.

08:08.131 --> 08:10.350
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:38.912 --> 08:41.586
Alex, let's go take a shit.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.551
- Why don't you go by yourself?
- No, dude. Listen, okay?

08:45.710 --> 08:47.007
Listen, take some knowledge.

08:47.170 --> 08:49.093
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

08:49.255 --> 08:52.555
The toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets, all right, if that.

08:52.717 --> 08:56.267
Now, let's say halfway through the
flight, your body wants that food out.

08:56.429 --> 08:58.056
You gotta go torque
a wicked cable.

08:58.222 --> 09:02.693
And then right after you, like, directly
after you walks in Christa or Blake.

09:04.479 --> 09:07.699
You want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

09:07.857 --> 09:10.360
That reflexive gag at the
back of their throat?

09:23.289 --> 09:25.212
John Denver.

09:30.964 --> 09:33.058
Died in a plane crash.

09:33.216 --> 09:36.060
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you for your patience.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.221
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

09:38.388 --> 09:42.939
of VolÃ©e Air Flight 180
to Paris through Gate 46.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.613
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?

09:55.780 --> 09:57.202
How did we lose him?

10:04.330 --> 10:06.458
Go. Go.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.485
Go.
Ow.

10:34.652 --> 10:35.452
Ow.

10:35.454 --> 10:36.654
That hurt.

10:51.794 --> 10:53.467
Oh, my little baby.

10:54.255 --> 10:56.257
That's a good sign. The
younger, the better.

10:56.424 --> 10:58.643
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

11:00.136 --> 11:01.262
Hi.

11:03.806 --> 11:05.808
A really fucked-up God.

11:06.392 --> 11:07.894
Yeah.

11:08.895 --> 11:09.987
- Hi.
- Hey, Tod.

11:10.146 --> 11:13.070
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna sit here.

11:28.831 --> 11:32.210
- Can you switch seats with Christa?
- Oh, God.

11:32.376 --> 11:35.004
You know, I would, but
I got a bladder thing.

11:35.171 --> 11:38.801
It's a urinary tract infection.

11:39.050 --> 11:40.472
Let's go ask Alex.

11:48.059 --> 11:52.109
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

11:52.271 --> 11:55.696
She asked Tod, but he said he
had some sort of medical thing.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.486
Please?

11:59.612 --> 12:01.239
Yeah.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.417
You're so sweet.

12:05.576 --> 12:08.876
- Thanks, Alex.
- Thank you, Alex.

12:09.038 --> 12:11.541
You're welcome, you're
welcome, you're welcome.

12:11.707 --> 12:13.880
Fag.

12:15.503 --> 12:19.758
Did you really think we're gonna
titty fuck them over Greenland?

12:19.924 --> 12:25.522
You know, because of you, I gotta sit
here and watch fucking Stuart Little.

12:25.972 --> 12:27.440
Thank you.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.646
Thanks, man. That's great.

12:31.686 --> 12:35.111
Sorry I'm late. That's
my seat right there.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.488
- Hello?
- I'm going that way.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.653
May I have your attention?

12:40.820 --> 12:44.620
To properly fasten your seat belts,
slide the flat portion into the buckle.

12:46.659 --> 12:50.835
Equipped with six emergency exits: Two in
front, two over the wing, two in the rear.

12:50.997 --> 12:52.340
All exits are clearly marked.

12:52.498 --> 12:55.627
Follow the red exit signs and
public lighting in the aisle way.

12:55.793 --> 12:58.512
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

13:42.006 --> 13:45.431
- All right.
- All right, all right.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.434
Yeah.

13:52.350 --> 13:53.397
Whatever.

14:00.983 --> 14:01.984
Huh?

14:06.239 --> 14:08.162
It's okay.

14:11.786 --> 14:13.754
- I wanna go.
- It's fine.

14:22.171 --> 14:23.844
It's okay, honey, I...

14:31.222 --> 14:32.223
What the...?

14:41.899 --> 14:43.367
Oh, my God!

14:50.032 --> 14:51.204
Everybody...

15:14.849 --> 15:17.398
No! No!

15:18.519 --> 15:20.317
Christa! No!

15:43.836 --> 15:47.761
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.638
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.

15:51.927 --> 15:53.053
Please?

15:59.810 --> 16:00.936
What's up, dude?

16:04.899 --> 16:07.118
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your problem?

16:07.276 --> 16:08.573
Alex, qu'est-ce que c'e-st?

16:08.736 --> 16:11.865
- The fucking plane's gonna explode.
- Shut up, Browning.

16:12.031 --> 16:14.284
- You're so not funny.
- If this is your joke...

16:14.450 --> 16:16.077
it's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.712
- Alex, take it easy.
- That's it, sit down, Browning.

16:18.871 --> 16:21.294
- It's going down.
- We will remove you.

16:21.457 --> 16:23.459
- I'll remove him.
- I'll remove myself.

16:23.626 --> 16:24.969
- Excuse me.
- Get off him.

16:26.295 --> 16:28.798
- That's my seat right there.
- This plane is going down.

16:28.964 --> 16:31.217
Everybody in the
aisle, off the plane.

16:31.384 --> 16:33.227
- Get off the plane.
- Stay where you are.

16:33.386 --> 16:35.809
- Just sit tight.
- The fucking plane is going down.

16:37.223 --> 16:38.975
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

16:39.141 --> 16:40.267
Okay.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.950
- I got my ticket here.
- Get off me.

16:53.322 --> 16:54.494
Jerk.

16:54.657 --> 16:56.079
- Hey.
- You got this?

16:56.492 --> 16:57.835
No one gets back on board.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.587
- That's my call.
- Wait, please.

17:00.746 --> 17:03.169
I've got 40 students going to Paris.
Please, please?

17:03.332 --> 17:07.053
- Look, you must understand my position.
- I understand, and I apologize for Alex.

17:07.211 --> 17:09.088
But one of us needs
to be on that plane.

17:09.255 --> 17:11.508
I cannot let students go
to Paris for ten days...

17:11.674 --> 17:13.472
Carter, no.

17:13.634 --> 17:15.352
- Sit the fuck down, Carter.
- Sit down.

17:15.511 --> 17:16.512
Sit.

17:16.679 --> 17:19.057
One of you can go on the flight.
That's it.

17:19.223 --> 17:20.941
Larry.

17:22.810 --> 17:25.689
Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.

17:25.855 --> 17:28.483
The rest can take an 11:10 flight.
It gets in three...

17:28.649 --> 17:30.242
I'll stay.

17:30.401 --> 17:34.031
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane, it's fine.

17:34.196 --> 17:36.790
Hi, Mr. Murnau. See, I
was in the bathroom.

17:36.949 --> 17:38.872
And the lock, it
was stuck, and...

17:39.034 --> 17:40.877
Oh, wait, I didn't
fight with anyone.

17:42.538 --> 17:44.040
Damn.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.042
Thanks.

17:50.546 --> 17:53.641
I just... I called your parents.
They're on their way.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.063
We should be going.

18:03.142 --> 18:05.691
Alex, talk to me. Tell
me what happened.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.901
I saw it.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.199
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.735
I saw it take off.

18:12.902 --> 18:14.154
I saw out my window.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.664
- I saw the ground, and...
- Carter.

18:16.822 --> 18:20.247
The cabin, it starts to shake, right?
And the left side blows up.

18:20.409 --> 18:22.252
And then the whole
plane just explodes.

18:22.745 --> 18:25.919
And it was so real. Just like how
everything happens, you know?

18:26.081 --> 18:27.549
You been on planes that blew up?

18:27.708 --> 18:29.176
You must have fallen asleep.

18:30.085 --> 18:32.258
Whoa, we get thrown
off the plane.

18:32.421 --> 18:34.264
We blow, what, a half
a day in Paris...

18:34.423 --> 18:36.846
all because Browning has
a bad fucking dream?

18:37.009 --> 18:40.013
But wait, "The plane, it's gonna
blow up, it's gonna blow up."

18:40.179 --> 18:42.056
- Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
- Tod.

18:42.223 --> 18:44.772
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.356
- Get off him.
- Hey, hey.

18:46.519 --> 18:48.567
- Alex, stop it.
- Come on, now.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.577
There they go, here we stay.

18:57.488 --> 19:00.207
- You're paying for my trip.
- I wish you were on that plane.

19:00.366 --> 19:02.789
- You fucking prick.
- Oh, shit!

19:11.293 --> 19:13.967
- Call it in.
- Security...

20:05.848 --> 20:08.226
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

20:11.812 --> 20:13.735
I didn't cause this.

20:16.609 --> 20:18.782
Are there any survivors?

20:24.241 --> 20:25.868
How should I know?

20:29.079 --> 20:31.628
- What, you think I'm some sort of...?
- He's not a witch.

20:38.088 --> 20:41.638
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel, National
Transportation Safety Board.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.555
We've contacted all your families.
They are on the way.

20:45.721 --> 20:50.067
Is there anyone here who feels they might
need a little medical attention...

20:50.225 --> 20:52.444
or spiritual counseling
at this time?

20:52.603 --> 20:53.900
What's going on?

20:54.063 --> 20:55.906
Are there any survivors?

20:57.650 --> 21:00.745
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

21:00.903 --> 21:03.201
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

21:03.364 --> 21:05.162
Naval Search and Rescue en route.
We...

21:06.492 --> 21:07.744
Excuse me.

21:07.910 --> 21:09.878
I'm Agent Weine. This
is Agent Schreck.

21:10.245 --> 21:11.713
We're with the FBI.

21:11.872 --> 21:14.250
I understand now you all
must be feeling right now.

21:14.416 --> 21:15.918
I know it's gonna be difficult.

21:16.085 --> 21:18.713
We're gonna ask you questions
regarding today's events...

21:18.879 --> 21:20.881
while they're still
fresh in your mind.

21:21.048 --> 21:25.394
This will prove invaluable to our rescue
attempts and any criminal investigation.

21:29.598 --> 21:33.444
You said, "Listen to me. This
plane will explode on takeoff."

21:33.936 --> 21:36.030
How did you know that?

21:36.397 --> 21:38.445
I got this feeling.

21:40.150 --> 21:41.276
This weird feeling.

21:41.902 --> 21:44.325
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane?

21:44.488 --> 21:47.367
Did you take any sleeping pills,
any narcotics, hallucinogens?

21:47.533 --> 21:49.877
- Alex, do you take any drugs?
- No.

21:51.495 --> 21:53.293
I saw it.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.130
I saw it happen.

21:57.543 --> 21:59.136
I saw the plane explode.

21:59.294 --> 22:01.843
Did the feelings have anything
to do with your saying...

22:02.005 --> 22:06.135
that you wished that Carter Horton was
on the plane just before it exploded?

22:07.469 --> 22:10.097
- No.
- Then why'd you say it?

22:11.265 --> 22:13.518
Because I really didn't
think it was gonna happen.

22:13.684 --> 22:18.315
If that's the case, Alex, then why
did you really get off the plane?

22:21.942 --> 22:27.415
My brother, George, he told me
to go and keep an eye on Alex.

22:28.115 --> 22:32.461
And so he stayed, and...

22:37.875 --> 22:40.754
He told me to get off the plane.

22:41.170 --> 22:47.394
Larry Murnau said I should get back
on, but I told him that he should go.

22:49.136 --> 22:51.480
I sent him back on the plane.

22:54.057 --> 22:55.479
All right.

22:56.351 --> 22:58.604
Nobody forced you off the plane.

22:58.771 --> 23:01.866
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

23:02.024 --> 23:04.277
So, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

23:06.361 --> 23:09.410
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

23:13.744 --> 23:15.838
And I believed him.

23:29.468 --> 23:30.515
Honey.

23:32.888 --> 23:34.390
Oh, God.

23:37.726 --> 23:39.319
There he is.

23:39.478 --> 23:41.071
Over here.

24:06.088 --> 24:08.090
Thank you for the ride.

25:10.277 --> 25:12.655
You're looking at the
first piece of debris...

25:12.821 --> 25:15.324
to wash ashore from
VolÃ©e Air Flight 180...

25:15.490 --> 25:18.494
which erupted shortly after a 9:25 p.m.
takeoff...

25:18.660 --> 25:21.129
From John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York.

25:21.288 --> 25:23.211
There are no known survivors.

25:23.373 --> 25:26.092
However, Coast Guard and Naval
Search and Rescue efforts...

25:26.251 --> 25:31.132
are continuing at this moment even as
jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.

25:31.298 --> 25:33.892
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

25:34.051 --> 25:37.146
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

25:37.304 --> 25:41.184
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

25:41.350 --> 25:45.321
Amongst the travelers, a class of
40 students and four teachers...

25:45.479 --> 25:48.198
from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York...

25:48.357 --> 25:50.530
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

25:50.943 --> 25:54.413
There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft...

25:54.571 --> 25:56.039
moments before departure.

25:56.198 --> 26:00.203
However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.

26:00.702 --> 26:03.626
Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board...

26:03.789 --> 26:06.838
and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation have arrived at JFK...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.378
to begin the initial
investigation.

26:09.544 --> 26:12.388
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

26:12.547 --> 26:15.096
report seeing the plane explode.

26:15.258 --> 26:17.932
No other aircraft were
visibly near Flight 180.

26:18.095 --> 26:20.894
At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating...

26:21.056 --> 26:22.729
these eyewitness accounts.

26:22.891 --> 26:28.694
After the explosion, debris apparently rained
into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.

26:28.855 --> 26:32.450
However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts...

26:32.609 --> 26:37.911
believing they'll learn more from the
found debris when daylight arrives.

26:55.298 --> 26:57.596
Thirty-nine days have passed...

26:57.759 --> 27:02.936
since we lost our 39 loved
ones, friends and teachers.

27:03.265 --> 27:07.771
As each day passes without a
determining cause for the accident...

27:07.936 --> 27:10.940
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

27:11.523 --> 27:14.072
Ecclesiastes tells us:

27:14.234 --> 27:20.287
"Man no more knows his own time than
fish taken in the fatal net..."

27:20.449 --> 27:22.952
or birds trapped in the snare.

27:23.118 --> 27:29.296
"Like these, the children of men caught
when the time falls suddenly upon them."

27:30.125 --> 27:32.503
And so, before we can heal...

27:32.669 --> 27:37.140
before we can escape the
presence of death and time...

27:37.299 --> 27:42.430
we must mourn and celebrate
theirs with this memorial.

28:26.765 --> 28:29.689
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't up on this wall...

28:29.851 --> 28:31.524
that I owe you anything.

28:32.354 --> 28:33.401
I don't.

28:33.563 --> 28:35.281
Because all I owe
are these people.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.033
To live my life to the fullest.

28:37.859 --> 28:40.328
Why don't you stay off the
J.D., then, huh, Carter?

28:40.487 --> 28:43.411
Listen. Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do, all right?

28:43.573 --> 28:44.870
I control my life, not you.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.535
Carter.

28:48.995 --> 28:50.918
I'm never gonna die.

28:59.214 --> 29:00.761
Hey, Alex.

29:00.924 --> 29:02.892
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:03.385 --> 29:06.013
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

29:06.179 --> 29:09.058
Got a 70. it's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

29:09.474 --> 29:11.226
When I was done with the test...

29:11.393 --> 29:13.361
You know the guy that
drives with you?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.817
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyways.

29:14.980 --> 29:19.486
He goes, "Young man, you're
gonna die at a very young age."

29:19.651 --> 29:21.653
Yeah. Yeah.

29:22.737 --> 29:23.989
Is that true?

29:24.781 --> 29:27.159
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

29:30.579 --> 29:33.298
If I ask out Cynthia
Paster, will she say no?

29:33.456 --> 29:35.049
Fuck.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29:36.418 --> 29:37.886
Yeah.

29:45.594 --> 29:47.062
- Miss Lewton...
- Don't talk to me.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.188
You scare the hell out of me.

29:50.807 --> 29:52.309
I'm gonna go up.

30:00.358 --> 30:01.701
Hey.

30:02.444 --> 30:03.946
Hey.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.282
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way.

30:07.449 --> 30:10.498
But I miss you, you know?

30:10.660 --> 30:11.957
Yeah.

30:12.287 --> 30:14.289
Yeah, I miss you too.

30:14.664 --> 30:17.213
But my father, you know,
he doesn't understand.

30:17.375 --> 30:18.752
Yeah.

30:20.378 --> 30:22.722
Hey, look, when he gets
over this thing...

30:22.881 --> 30:25.976
you and me, little road
trip to the city, you know?

30:26.134 --> 30:27.807
Catch the Yanks.

30:27.969 --> 30:31.064
Yeah. Yeah, all
right, we'll do that.

30:31.389 --> 30:32.641
Cool.

30:34.809 --> 30:36.903
- Look, I'd better go.
- Yeah.

30:37.062 --> 30:40.692
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in
class, they're gonna let me read it.

30:41.650 --> 30:43.948
It says what I'm feeling.

30:45.654 --> 30:47.327
Take care, man.

30:56.831 --> 30:59.505
Because of you, I'm still alive.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.012
Thank you.

31:10.512 --> 31:14.107
"We say that the hour of
death cannot be forecast."

31:15.600 --> 31:20.982
But when we say this, we imagine
that the hour is placed...

31:21.147 --> 31:24.697
in an obscure and
distant future.

31:24.859 --> 31:28.204
It never occurs to us that
it has any connection...

31:28.363 --> 31:30.866
with the day already begun.

31:31.032 --> 31:34.832
Or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

31:35.287 --> 31:39.167
This afternoon, which
is so certain...

31:39.666 --> 31:44.388
"...and which has every
hour filled in advance."

37:28.640 --> 37:30.768
What happened?

37:30.933 --> 37:32.935
Where's Tod?

37:35.188 --> 37:37.031
Alex.

37:38.691 --> 37:39.908
Get out of here.

37:54.582 --> 37:57.051
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

37:57.543 --> 38:03.425
You caused Tod so much guilt over George
staying on the plane, he took his own life.

38:04.092 --> 38:05.844
- No.
- Time to go.

38:08.096 --> 38:10.849
Look, he wouldn't do that.

38:11.015 --> 38:13.939
Okay? He said to me we'd be friends
again after you got better.

38:14.352 --> 38:18.027
Why would he make plans with me if he
was thinking about killing himself?

38:18.189 --> 38:19.532
Mr. Waggner.

38:21.984 --> 38:23.281
- Mr. Waggner.
- Here we go.

38:23.444 --> 38:25.117
Easy.

38:25.863 --> 38:27.490
All right.

38:28.241 --> 38:29.993
Here we go.

38:45.717 --> 38:47.560
Let's go.

39:17.457 --> 39:18.674
Almost autumn.

39:20.001 --> 39:21.548
It's only the end of June.

39:23.713 --> 39:26.091
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.150
If you focus even now,
just one week into summer...

39:28.176 --> 39:30.679
you can feel almost
feel autumn coming.

39:30.845 --> 39:33.189
Kind of like being able
to see the future.

39:34.557 --> 39:36.651
Why were you at Tod's
house last night?

39:39.854 --> 39:44.030
I've seen enough TV to know that the
FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.

39:44.192 --> 39:46.695
They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...

39:46.861 --> 39:48.238
what caused the crash.

39:48.404 --> 39:49.872
They haven't ruled out anything.

39:50.031 --> 39:53.331
The fact that seven people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.

39:53.493 --> 39:57.088
Not to mention that one of those
people had a vision, or whatever...

39:57.246 --> 40:01.376
of the plane exploding minutes before
it did explode, is highly suspicious.

40:01.542 --> 40:05.046
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

40:06.881 --> 40:08.508
Why were you there last night?

40:14.555 --> 40:16.853
Do you know what this is?

40:19.060 --> 40:21.529
This is a...

40:23.898 --> 40:26.196
Who's the spring-head guy?

40:26.651 --> 40:28.745
It's you.

40:28.903 --> 40:31.372
Not a likeness.

40:31.531 --> 40:36.037
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

40:36.202 --> 40:37.920
I'm sorry.

40:38.830 --> 40:43.131
You know, like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know what, or why, it is.

40:43.292 --> 40:45.465
It's reluctant to take form.

40:45.628 --> 40:51.226
And yet, creating an absolute but
incomprehensible attraction.

40:53.469 --> 40:56.689
In four years of high school, we
haven't said one word to each other.

40:56.848 --> 41:00.318
At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

41:00.476 --> 41:02.604
I didn't know where those
emotions were from...

41:02.770 --> 41:05.023
until you started freaking out.

41:05.857 --> 41:09.953
I didn't see what you
saw, but I felt it.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.784
You can still feel
it, can't you?

41:13.322 --> 41:16.747
Something from that day
is still with you.

41:18.619 --> 41:21.498
I know because I can
still feel you.

41:23.624 --> 41:26.298
That's why I was
there last night.

41:28.337 --> 41:31.261
You know, I've never
dealt with death before.

41:31.716 --> 41:34.765
This could all be in our head.

41:35.636 --> 41:37.855
It just feels like
it's all around us.

41:38.639 --> 41:40.141
It?

41:42.435 --> 41:45.279
What if Tod was just the first?

41:46.188 --> 41:47.314
Of us?

41:47.815 --> 41:49.658
Is that something
that you're feeling?

41:51.110 --> 41:54.330
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.

41:54.697 --> 41:56.244
One last time.

41:56.407 --> 41:58.830
So maybe I would know.

41:59.452 --> 42:00.795
Then let's go see him.

42:31.692 --> 42:33.365
Easy.

42:35.696 --> 42:37.949
Gives me a rush.

42:39.450 --> 42:41.418
This place?

42:42.036 --> 42:44.630
Doing something I'm
not supposed to.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.002
Come on.

42:53.422 --> 42:55.174
Hurry up.

43:09.271 --> 43:12.366
- Is that him?
- I think.

43:12.525 --> 43:14.903
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

43:15.736 --> 43:17.613
Yeah, that's him.

43:18.447 --> 43:21.747
But whatever it was that made
him Tod is definitely gone.

43:24.829 --> 43:25.876
Christ.

43:26.664 --> 43:28.712
Shh.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.626
Please.

43:31.252 --> 43:33.425
You'll wake the dead.

43:44.181 --> 43:45.353
Why did his hand do that?

43:45.516 --> 43:51.194
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasms.

43:51.522 --> 43:53.650
Look, um...

43:53.816 --> 43:56.535
- I'm his friend and...
- I know who you are.

43:58.279 --> 43:59.997
What are all those tiny marks?

44:00.781 --> 44:03.785
Cuticle lacerations from
pulling at the wire.

44:03.951 --> 44:05.919
Pulling at the wire?

44:06.078 --> 44:09.002
If he was pulling at the wire, he
wasn't trying to kill himself.

44:09.165 --> 44:13.170
- It was an accident.
- In death, there are no accidents.

44:13.335 --> 44:16.305
No coincidences. No mishaps.

44:16.464 --> 44:18.808
And no escapes.

44:20.259 --> 44:25.891
What you have to realize is that we're all
just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.

44:26.432 --> 44:30.812
Every single move we make, from
the mundane to the monumental...

44:30.978 --> 44:33.902
the red light that
we stop at or run...

44:34.065 --> 44:36.659
the people we have sex
with, or won't with us...

44:36.817 --> 44:40.117
the airplanes that we
ride, or walk out of...

44:40.696 --> 44:45.167
it's all part of death's sadistic
design leading to the grave.

44:46.452 --> 44:48.375
Design?

44:49.497 --> 44:53.923
Does that mean if you figure out
the design, you could cheat death?

44:54.293 --> 44:56.421
Alex.

44:56.587 --> 44:59.807
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

44:59.965 --> 45:02.184
Your friend's departure shows...

45:02.343 --> 45:06.519
that death has a new
design for all of you.

45:06.931 --> 45:12.938
Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.

45:14.188 --> 45:15.656
Play your hunch, Alex.

45:16.065 --> 45:19.035
If you think you can
get away with it.

45:19.193 --> 45:24.199
But remember the risk
of cheating the plan...

45:24.365 --> 45:28.666
of disrespecting the design
could incite a fury...

45:28.828 --> 45:31.707
that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

45:33.833 --> 45:37.337
And you don't even wanna
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

45:41.966 --> 45:43.593
Okay, then, well...

45:44.218 --> 45:47.017
Yeah, I'm sorry we
broke in and...

45:47.179 --> 45:49.853
No harm. No foul.

45:53.811 --> 45:55.404
I'll see you soon.

46:02.236 --> 46:04.739
The mortician said that
death has a design.

46:04.905 --> 46:06.532
Okay.

46:07.741 --> 46:09.288
I'm talking about omens.

46:09.743 --> 46:13.589
How do we know that just by sitting
here, by sipping this coffee...

46:13.747 --> 46:16.341
or breathing the air or
crossing the intersection...

46:16.500 --> 46:21.131
that we haven't started in motion the
events that will lead to our death...

46:21.297 --> 46:23.595
40 years from now, 10
years from now, tomorrow?

46:25.259 --> 46:28.354
We don't unless we
open ourselves up...

46:28.512 --> 46:32.016
to the signs it's
willing to show us.

46:35.269 --> 46:36.395
I don't understand.

46:36.562 --> 46:39.361
Did you see Tod die?

46:39.523 --> 46:42.367
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

46:42.526 --> 46:45.951
No, no, it didn't, but I
mean, it might as well have.

46:46.655 --> 46:49.499
This is a message of
something, Clear.

46:49.658 --> 46:52.912
Or someone, hinting at a design.

46:53.078 --> 46:57.424
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.927
Coffee. Starts with a
C and ends with an E.

47:00.085 --> 47:03.259
So does the word choke. So, what,
we're gonna choke to death?

47:03.422 --> 47:04.674
I wanna hear you.

47:05.925 --> 47:08.269
We'll go nuts if you
start with this shit.

47:09.094 --> 47:12.598
The mortician said that
death has a design, right?

47:12.765 --> 47:18.317
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton...

47:18.479 --> 47:20.527
messed up that design
for whatever reason?

47:20.689 --> 47:24.865
I saw death's plan,
then we cheated it.

47:25.069 --> 47:26.366
But what if it was our time?

47:26.528 --> 47:28.951
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

47:29.114 --> 47:32.459
What if it still is our time?

47:32.618 --> 47:36.088
If it is, then
it's not finished.

47:36.247 --> 47:40.468
And we will die now, not later.

47:40.626 --> 47:42.344
Unless...

47:42.503 --> 47:45.848
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

47:55.349 --> 47:57.898
After hearing you,
I do believe...

47:59.436 --> 48:01.279
that Tod killed himself.

48:30.551 --> 48:32.804
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.

48:32.970 --> 48:36.565
- You all right, man?
- Hey, baby, come on, not now.

48:36.724 --> 48:38.897
- Carter.
- Oh.

48:39.059 --> 48:41.153
It looks like we have a
bit of a reunion here.

48:41.312 --> 48:43.406
- Let it go.
- When are you moving?

48:43.564 --> 48:44.690
A couple weeks.

48:44.857 --> 48:46.154
- That's too bad.
- You dick.

48:46.317 --> 48:48.570
- We're losing our favorite teacher.
- Baby, come on.

48:48.736 --> 48:51.239
Look, guys. There's something
I need to tell you, okay?

48:51.405 --> 48:53.908
- Alex.
- And you lived here your whole life? Yeah.

48:54.074 --> 48:56.577
And now she's gotta move
all because of Browning.

48:56.744 --> 48:59.748
Enough, both of you.

48:59.913 --> 49:01.881
They died and we lived.

49:02.291 --> 49:04.419
Get over it.

49:04.585 --> 49:08.340
I will not let this plane crash be
the most important thing in my life.

49:10.007 --> 49:12.385
I'm moving on, Carter.

49:12.801 --> 49:14.769
And if you wanna
waste your life...

49:14.928 --> 49:18.273
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

49:18.432 --> 49:21.402
then you can just
drop fucking dead.

49:31.070 --> 49:33.118
- Okay.
- You look like a smart shopper.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.452
Well, thank you.

49:34.615 --> 49:37.494
Let's just say you were to see this
knife set in e department store.

49:37.659 --> 49:39.081
What do you think
you'd have to pay?

49:40.412 --> 49:42.212
Wow, that's a huge knife
set, but how many...?

49:47.878 --> 49:50.848
- Hello?
- Is Alex there?

49:51.006 --> 49:53.054
Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah,
just a minute.

49:54.385 --> 49:56.808
It's Clear again. You
wanna talk to her?

49:56.970 --> 50:00.975
<i>The economy kept trading volume
below average today, and stocks...</i>

50:01.141 --> 50:03.735
Clear, he's in the shower.

50:03.894 --> 50:07.865
- Can I get him to call you back?
- Sure, bye.

50:08.607 --> 50:10.655
She's concerned about you.

50:10.818 --> 50:12.570
I'm concerned about you.

50:12.736 --> 50:14.363
Why won't you talk to her?

50:15.364 --> 50:16.581
Or me?

50:16.740 --> 50:19.619
<i>Which could put a cloud
over both stocks and bonds.</i>

50:19.785 --> 50:22.334
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help.

50:22.496 --> 50:27.252
But there's something I need to
understand before I can talk to anyone.

50:27.418 --> 50:29.762
<i>The Dow down 75.</i>

50:29.920 --> 50:33.049
<i>The National Transportation Safety
Board has a new theory tonight...</i>

50:33.215 --> 50:36.719
<i>on the possible cause of the
explosion of VolÃ©e Air Flight 180.</i>

50:36.885 --> 50:39.855
<i>Officials believe deterioration
of silicon insulation...</i>

50:40.013 --> 50:42.516
<i>on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...</i>

50:42.683 --> 50:44.435
<i>may have leaked
combustible fluids.</i>

50:44.601 --> 50:47.024
- <i>A spark in the fuel switch...</i>
- That's Tod's seat.

50:47.187 --> 50:51.112
<i>In the fuselage may have ignited the fuel
line and proceeded to the fuel pump...</i>

50:51.275 --> 50:54.620
<i>which would have set off the
catastrophic explosion.</i>

51:25.225 --> 51:27.068
The path of the explosion.

51:27.811 --> 51:31.861
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.

51:32.024 --> 51:34.527
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

51:34.693 --> 51:36.821
That's death's design.

51:37.529 --> 51:39.873
Miss Lewton's next.

51:41.658 --> 51:43.877
And whenever I can
fall asleep, I just...

51:44.036 --> 51:45.333
I see Terry Chaney.

51:46.413 --> 51:48.131
And in the day,
out of nowhere...

51:48.290 --> 51:50.759
I hear the sound of my
own voice in my head...

51:50.918 --> 51:52.090
saying to Larry Murnau:

51:52.252 --> 51:55.882
"No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane."

51:56.048 --> 51:58.676
Everything reminds
me of that day.

52:01.094 --> 52:02.812
Right, yeah.

52:02.971 --> 52:04.393
I'm hoping a change will help.

52:04.556 --> 52:10.279
It's just that I've lived
here my whole life, you know?

52:10.437 --> 52:13.236
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

52:13.398 --> 52:15.947
And now all I see is Larry...

52:16.109 --> 52:20.330
and those kids, you know?

52:20.489 --> 52:24.744
Just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

52:31.333 --> 52:33.961
Laura, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

52:34.127 --> 52:35.629
Right.

52:44.429 --> 52:47.103
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

53:13.584 --> 53:15.632
What are you doing here?

53:15.794 --> 53:18.013
I was just...

53:18.171 --> 53:21.471
I was checking the air in the
tire to make sure it's safe.

53:21.633 --> 53:23.010
Get in the car.

53:34.813 --> 53:36.736
Put on your seat belt.

53:59.504 --> 54:05.102
I believe that Miss
Lewton is next.

54:06.136 --> 54:07.183
- Next?
- Yes.

54:09.097 --> 54:14.228
Yeah, next, because there's
this pattern that's occurring.

54:14.394 --> 54:17.694
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?

54:34.081 --> 54:36.254
Mom's favorite.

54:58.480 --> 55:00.448
So, what about this
pattern, Alex?

55:00.607 --> 55:02.735
Did you see it in another
one of your visions?

55:02.901 --> 55:05.120
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

55:07.781 --> 55:11.001
You know, I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

55:11.618 --> 55:15.748
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs
and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.

55:15.914 --> 55:18.667
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

55:18.834 --> 55:22.555
Six lives, and everybody in my
entire school thinks I'm a freak.

55:23.296 --> 55:26.641
And I'm not... I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

55:26.800 --> 55:30.100
I don't have a narcissistic
deity complex.

55:30.262 --> 55:33.357
I'm not going
Dahmer on you guys.

55:33.515 --> 55:34.687
This just is.

55:36.017 --> 55:38.145
There is a pattern for us all.

55:38.311 --> 55:41.030
There's a pattern for you,
there is a pattern for you.

55:41.189 --> 55:43.612
There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.869
But I'm gonna break this one.

57:05.774 --> 57:08.027
Alex, you came to our
attention at first...

57:08.193 --> 57:11.242
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

57:11.404 --> 57:15.534
Now, I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

57:15.951 --> 57:20.957
And we were ready to move on, but then
the other survivors started to die.

57:21.122 --> 57:22.874
First, your friend Tod.

57:23.041 --> 57:25.464
Then Terry Chaney, while you
were there at the scene.

57:25.627 --> 57:28.346
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

57:28.505 --> 57:30.724
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.

57:30.882 --> 57:34.261
Unless they are taking
lives and causing death.

57:34.427 --> 57:37.226
Now, can you promise me that
no one else is going to die?

57:38.640 --> 57:39.766
No, I can't.

57:39.933 --> 57:42.903
As long as I'm in here, it's
out of my control, I'm sorry.

57:48.859 --> 57:53.035
Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.

57:54.114 --> 57:55.866
Thank you.

58:04.124 --> 58:06.047
That kid gives me the creeps.

58:06.209 --> 58:08.462
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.

58:08.628 --> 58:10.255
That's not what I'm
talking about.

58:10.422 --> 58:13.175
There were a couple
of moments there...

58:14.467 --> 58:16.185
where I almost believed him.

58:17.637 --> 58:20.231
Can I tell you something? Don't
take this the wrong way.

58:20.390 --> 58:22.609
But sometimes, you
give me the creeps.

58:39.826 --> 58:42.454
You've gotta stop this. Stop
this, it's a stupid mug.

58:42.996 --> 58:45.840
You're out of here. Pretty
soon, you'll be gone.

58:45.999 --> 58:47.717
You'll be gone.

01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:01.142
Miss Lewton.

01:01:09.768 --> 01:01:11.395
Miss Lewton.

01:01:13.188 --> 01:01:15.316
Okay, all right, okay.

01:01:15.482 --> 01:01:17.484
Just stay still, okay?

01:01:25.825 --> 01:01:27.418
Oh, God. Ch, God. Miss Lewton.

01:01:42.842 --> 01:01:44.640
Hey, Alex.

01:02:05.115 --> 01:02:06.867
Dude.

01:02:09.035 --> 01:02:11.129
I don't know where he is.

01:02:11.287 --> 01:02:14.166
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?

01:02:14.374 --> 01:02:16.342
Because I didn't believe him.

01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:17.718
If he does contact you...

01:02:17.877 --> 01:02:21.381
I think it would be in the best interest
of your safety if you called us.

01:02:21.548 --> 01:02:24.301
Now, here's my card.

01:02:24.467 --> 01:02:25.969
Toll-free number.

01:02:30.056 --> 01:02:31.649
Interesting work.

01:02:43.278 --> 01:02:44.325
Carter, you dick.

01:03:01.421 --> 01:03:03.173
What are you doing?

01:03:05.758 --> 01:03:07.681
Terry's name should
be on this wall.

01:03:10.763 --> 01:03:12.606
Shit.

01:03:13.141 --> 01:03:15.769
Why'd you want us to meet
you here anyway, huh?

01:03:15.935 --> 01:03:19.439
Because they're watching
me, see if I go to Alex.

01:03:19.606 --> 01:03:21.529
That's why you're taking me.

01:03:21.691 --> 01:03:22.988
Why would I wanna see him?

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.863
Because he knows which
one of us is next.

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:43.630
So drive the speed limit, okay?

01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:46.891
Oh, and don't pass on the right.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.303
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.

01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:52.684
You're the next one, man.

01:03:53.181 --> 01:03:54.603
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

01:03:54.766 --> 01:03:58.236
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:04:19.249 --> 01:04:21.343
He could be anywhere from
here to a mile down.

01:04:21.501 --> 01:04:24.220
So you guys drive down there,
we'll meet around the middle.

01:04:24.379 --> 01:04:26.347
It'll take half the time.

01:04:56.536 --> 01:04:58.630
Do you think they're
still up there?

01:05:00.707 --> 01:05:04.211
Somehow, Flight 180, are
they still in flight?

01:05:04.377 --> 01:05:07.472
Somewhere, are they safe?

01:05:10.675 --> 01:05:14.600
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

01:05:14.762 --> 01:05:17.390
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

01:05:18.057 --> 01:05:20.355
Lying awake at night
just worrying.

01:05:20.518 --> 01:05:22.816
Yeah, well, most
kids do, I guess.

01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:25.694
Most kids never have it happen.

01:05:30.737 --> 01:05:34.412
When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

01:05:34.574 --> 01:05:37.077
I guess that he heard someone
say, "Don't turn around."

01:05:37.243 --> 01:05:40.588
So on reflex, or thinking it
was a friend joking, he did.

01:05:41.914 --> 01:05:43.541
And the guy blew his head off.

01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:47.094
Life became shit after that.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.799
My mom just couldn't
deal anymore.

01:05:51.716 --> 01:05:53.184
She married this asshole...

01:05:53.343 --> 01:05:57.598
who my mom with my real dad would have
crossed the street to avoid this guy.

01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:01.776
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.866
If that was the design for
my father and my family...

01:06:08.024 --> 01:06:10.197
then fuck death.

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:15.532
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere, Alex.

01:06:15.698 --> 01:06:19.373
It exists, that place. Where
my dad is still safe.

01:06:19.535 --> 01:06:23.711
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving.

01:06:24.207 --> 01:06:26.630
Where me and my mom and my
dad are still together...

01:06:26.793 --> 01:06:29.797
and have no idea about
this life here.

01:06:31.964 --> 01:06:34.558
Where our friends are
still in the sky.

01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:38.725
Where everyone gets
a second chance.

01:06:39.847 --> 01:06:42.771
Alex, we can't give up.

01:06:47.146 --> 01:06:48.443
Look, I can't go home.

01:06:48.606 --> 01:06:51.655
All right? After Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

01:06:51.818 --> 01:06:53.661
No, we're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.493
It's only a couple
miles from my house.

01:06:55.655 --> 01:06:58.659
All right, Browning,
you fucking Warlock.

01:06:58.825 --> 01:07:03.046
- Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
- Why do you think I was hiding?

01:07:03.204 --> 01:07:06.208
Billy told the FBI he saw
you running from her house.

01:07:06.374 --> 01:07:08.092
I was running because
they blame me.

01:07:08.251 --> 01:07:11.380
They blame me for Tod, they blame
me for her, for the plane crash.

01:07:11.546 --> 01:07:15.892
The fire, like, caramelized her blood,
Alex. Your shoe prints were in it.

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:19.145
- Your fingerprints were on the knives.
- I told you they were not...

01:07:19.303 --> 01:07:23.900
I'm not talking about whether or not you
did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.

01:07:24.058 --> 01:07:27.107
Did you know she was gonna
be next before she was?

01:07:33.693 --> 01:07:35.161
Yeah, I did.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.494
- I knew.
- All right.

01:07:39.991 --> 01:07:43.461
Out of us, who's next to see it?

01:07:43.619 --> 01:07:47.544
Please, tell me I'm gonna get to
see the Jets win a Super Bowl.

01:07:48.249 --> 01:07:51.002
It's me, right? That's
why you're not saying.

01:07:53.171 --> 01:07:56.425
I knew I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

01:07:56.591 --> 01:08:01.392
- What are you whining about? I'm next.
- He didn't say anything. Just drive.

01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.356
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:07.064
Do you think it's gonna make
it easier to know, Carter?

01:08:08.478 --> 01:08:11.402
Huh? It's not, it's gonna
make it fucking harder.

01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:14.575
You know, you get off
having control over me.

01:08:14.734 --> 01:08:18.955
- You let me decide how to deal with it.
- It doesn't matter who's next.

01:08:19.197 --> 01:08:21.746
Because we're all on the same list.
All of us.

01:08:23.493 --> 01:08:26.917
Oh, fuck. Really?

01:08:34.002 --> 01:08:36.756
All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?

01:08:36.923 --> 01:08:40.598
Me and Terry, we'll be back together on
the other side, so why wait any longer?

01:08:42.345 --> 01:08:43.688
Carter, what are you doing?

01:08:46.182 --> 01:08:47.649
Carter, slow down.

01:08:47.808 --> 01:08:49.935
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you.

01:08:52.438 --> 01:08:55.442
- Knock it off.
- May as well go out on my own free will.

01:08:55.608 --> 01:08:57.109
Not with us in the fucking car.

01:09:04.283 --> 01:09:05.785
- Jesus, Carter, no.
- Stop it.

01:09:07.118 --> 01:09:08.245
Carter, stop the car.

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.460
Hey, what's the worry
if it ain't your time?

01:09:10.622 --> 01:09:13.296
I could get nailed and you all
wouldn't give a shit, right?

01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:16.429
- It's only me.
- It doesn't work that way, Carter.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.140
And I fucking hated
French class.

01:09:28.558 --> 01:09:30.481
- Control yourself.
- That's what I'm doing.

01:09:30.643 --> 01:09:33.317
I know what you're doing. And
it's all right to be scared.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:36.073
I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.

01:09:36.232 --> 01:09:38.984
I control my life, I
control my death.

01:09:39.151 --> 01:09:41.745
You don't have to prove to us how
big your balls are. Not now.

01:09:45.491 --> 01:09:48.495
- Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
- What are you doing?

01:09:50.496 --> 01:09:54.251
Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ. Carter,
put your hands back on the wheel.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.511
- Carter, stop.
- Hands on the wheel, Carter.

01:09:58.421 --> 01:09:59.673
Oh, shit.

01:10:02.425 --> 01:10:03.472
Okay, Carter, easy.

01:10:03.634 --> 01:10:06.433
I am so close to puking right
now, you don't even wanna know.

01:10:09.307 --> 01:10:11.810
We're afraid too, Carter, but
we're not going to quit.

01:10:11.976 --> 01:10:15.071
Stop what you're doing and
stop this fucking car.

01:10:15.396 --> 01:10:19.196
Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.

01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:38.712
- Billy.
- Move it.

01:10:38.878 --> 01:10:41.677
- Hey, open the door, Billy.
- Move the fucking car!

01:10:41.839 --> 01:10:44.718
- Hey, open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

01:10:44.884 --> 01:10:45.931
Open it.

01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:48.061
- Open the door.
- Easy, easy, open the door.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.564
- Open the door.
- Billy, open the fucking door!

01:10:50.723 --> 01:10:52.566
- Billy, open it!
- Open the door!

01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:53.817
Open the door!

01:10:57.647 --> 01:11:00.571
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

01:11:05.154 --> 01:11:08.624
Goddamn it! Get out
of the fucking car.

01:11:08.783 --> 01:11:11.377
Carter, listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.

01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:12.582
This isn't the way.

01:11:12.745 --> 01:11:14.543
It's not the way.
Get out of the car.

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.503
- Come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!

01:11:20.086 --> 01:11:23.056
- Carter.
- It ain't my time.

01:11:34.225 --> 01:11:35.442
Oh, shit.

01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:38.901
Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.

01:11:39.063 --> 01:11:41.612
Carter, get out of the car.

01:11:41.774 --> 01:11:44.368
Come on, get out!

01:11:51.909 --> 01:11:53.126
I can't get out!

01:11:55.121 --> 01:11:58.591
Alex! No!

01:12:04.797 --> 01:12:06.390
Man, he really is next.

01:12:08.384 --> 01:12:10.102
- Get out!
- Get out!

01:12:10.261 --> 01:12:11.808
- Come on!
- Fuck!

01:12:31.907 --> 01:12:33.534
Oh, God.

01:12:34.827 --> 01:12:37.250
I saw it. I saw the belt.

01:12:37.413 --> 01:12:39.666
- Scared now?
- It broke.

01:12:39.832 --> 01:12:42.631
Bullshit. He saved
your life again.

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:44.010
That's right.

01:12:44.754 --> 01:12:48.179
You're next, Carter. I'm staying
the fuck away from you.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.684
- Shut up.
- We don't need this shit right now.

01:12:50.843 --> 01:12:54.188
I don't need it ever. What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.

01:12:54.346 --> 01:12:56.019
Hey, fuck you, Billy.
I'm not dead.

01:12:56.182 --> 01:13:00.358
Oh, you will be. You're
dead, you're dead.

01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:03.189
And you ain't
taking me with you!

01:13:06.192 --> 01:13:08.945
Oh, shit. Ch, shit.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.464
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:13:21.957 --> 01:13:24.836
You should've been next. You
should've been next after Lewton.

01:13:25.002 --> 01:13:26.800
That's the plan.
That's the design.

01:13:26.962 --> 01:13:29.181
- You should be dead.
- You're the fucking devil.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.013
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip.

01:13:32.384 --> 01:13:34.104
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.

01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:35.638
Just like the
explosion, I saw it.

01:13:35.805 --> 01:13:37.807
- The police are coming.
- Fuck, I saved him.

01:13:37.973 --> 01:13:39.020
Because I saved him...

01:13:39.183 --> 01:13:42.733
it skipped Carter, went to the next
in the path of the explosion, Billy.

01:13:42.895 --> 01:13:44.397
I have to see it.

01:13:44.563 --> 01:13:48.568
And if I see it, then I intervene. And
if I intervene, I cheat the design.

01:13:48.734 --> 01:13:51.203
What, intervene? What
are you, God now?

01:13:51.362 --> 01:13:53.364
Gods aren't afraid to die.

01:13:53.531 --> 01:13:55.875
Gods don't die. We do.

01:13:56.033 --> 01:13:57.910
- You know?
- Baby, you're losing it, okay?

01:13:58.077 --> 01:14:00.626
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.

01:14:00.788 --> 01:14:02.756
You can hide, and get
your head together.

01:14:02.915 --> 01:14:06.795
Okay, after Billy, I'm next.
I'm next.

01:14:07.586 --> 01:14:10.590
- And then me.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.

01:14:10.756 --> 01:14:12.383
I'm not gonna let
it happen, okay?

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.848
- Listen to me, all right?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.763
Why don't you two just get
the fuck out of here?

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:13.317
Rusted.

01:17:14.106 --> 01:17:15.779
Tetanus.

01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:18.744
Nice one.

01:17:20.112 --> 01:17:22.035
I overlooked it.

01:17:23.866 --> 01:17:28.793
You tried to capitalize. But
I caught you, you fuck.

01:17:29.705 --> 01:17:31.457
I can beat you.

01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:37.677
Yeah, I mean, not forever, but I got
this cabin rigged to beat you now!

01:18:29.223 --> 01:18:33.148
- She was there a minute ago.
- What are you talking about?

01:18:33.602 --> 01:18:35.696
I'm not turning him in.

01:18:36.105 --> 01:18:38.699
It's too dangerous for
him out there alone.

01:18:41.026 --> 01:18:44.326
- I go with you.
- You can't.

01:18:47.324 --> 01:18:49.247
Clear, you just tell
us where he is.

01:18:49.409 --> 01:18:51.036
Wait at home, I
give you my word...

01:18:51.203 --> 01:18:54.377
that we will bring him in
safely in protective custody.

01:19:24.278 --> 01:19:26.326
I never moved.

01:19:27.739 --> 01:19:30.083
Christa asked me to change
seats but I never moved.

01:19:30.242 --> 01:19:33.041
I would've been up next to Tod.

01:19:33.745 --> 01:19:35.793
Fuck, why didn't
I remember that?

01:19:35.956 --> 01:19:38.254
I never moved. Clear's
seat was in front of mine.

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:56.435
She's next.

01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:36.479
Alex!

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.937
Alex!

01:20:40.479 --> 01:20:43.278
Come on, get in the car. We're
going around. Get in the car.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.487
Come on!

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:46.652
- Go!
- Move!

01:21:14.638 --> 01:21:16.732
Oh, shit.

01:21:51.717 --> 01:21:53.719
- There!
- Come on, let's go, over here.

01:21:58.682 --> 01:22:00.150
Alex!

01:22:00.309 --> 01:22:02.027
Alex, we're trying to help you.

01:22:04.813 --> 01:22:06.861
Fritz, get away from it.

01:22:19.578 --> 01:22:20.670
Come on.

01:22:24.583 --> 01:22:25.584
Alex!

01:22:51.568 --> 01:22:52.785
Run!

01:23:39.324 --> 01:23:40.371
We lost him.

01:23:40.534 --> 01:23:43.162
From the direction, there's
only one place he's heading.

01:23:43.328 --> 01:23:44.671
No shit.

01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:14.381
Clear!

01:25:27.599 --> 01:25:28.851
No.

01:25:34.064 --> 01:25:35.281
Oh, my God.

01:25:41.238 --> 01:25:43.366
Don't move. Stay there.

01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:47.453
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.

01:25:47.619 --> 01:25:49.587
You're grounded by
the tires, okay?

01:26:19.234 --> 01:26:21.657
The car's gonna explode.

01:26:25.907 --> 01:26:28.330
I can only hold on for so
long, you know what to do.

01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:29.995
Don't!

01:26:30.161 --> 01:26:32.459
When I do this, it'll skip
you, and it'll be over.

01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:36.297
- It's the only way we can cheat death again.
- No, don't!

01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:40.009
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.

01:26:42.799 --> 01:26:44.972
I'll always be with you.

01:26:48.388 --> 01:26:49.435
NO!

01:26:53.518 --> 01:26:56.522
Alex!
Alex, get away from there.

01:26:57.606 --> 01:26:59.153
NO!

01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:19.670
Alex. Alex.

01:27:22.589 --> 01:27:25.513
Damn it, you can't
do this to me.

01:27:25.675 --> 01:27:28.053
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:27:28.219 --> 01:27:29.596
Alex, Alex?

01:27:29.763 --> 01:27:33.813
Alex, Alex? Oh, shit,
he's not breathing.

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.728
Hold on, Alex. Come
on, stay with me.

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:16.560
- Well, we made it.
- Paris, I can't believe it.

01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.774
I just can't believe we
got on a plane again.

01:28:18.937 --> 01:28:20.939
You know what I'm saying?

01:28:48.133 --> 01:28:49.225
Wow.

01:28:49.384 --> 01:28:51.136
It's weird being here, huh?

01:28:51.302 --> 01:28:53.646
We finally completed a puzzle.

01:28:55.223 --> 01:28:58.978
It's just there's something
missing, you know?

01:29:01.479 --> 01:29:03.072
- To Terry.
- Yeah.

01:29:03.231 --> 01:29:06.235
- To Tod.
- To all of our friends that can't be here.

01:29:06.401 --> 01:29:08.745
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:29:11.614 --> 01:29:12.661
What?

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.668
If you would have told
me six months ago...

01:29:15.827 --> 01:29:18.956
that the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

01:29:19.122 --> 01:29:20.248
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

01:29:20.415 --> 01:29:22.918
I mean, sometimes it just
feels like the two of you...

01:29:23.084 --> 01:29:25.678
are the only ones who
can really understand.

01:29:29.048 --> 01:29:33.599
You were right, Browning. It did skip us.
There was a design.

01:29:34.012 --> 01:29:36.265
We beat it. You know, we won.

01:29:37.348 --> 01:29:40.648
I think the only thing we won,
Carter, is a chance at a full life.

01:29:41.853 --> 01:29:44.572
A chance that I
won't ever waste.

01:29:44.981 --> 01:29:48.030
Yeah, there's just something...

01:29:48.193 --> 01:29:50.287
You know, something
I can't figure out.

01:29:50.445 --> 01:29:52.789
- What?
- About the design.

01:29:52.947 --> 01:29:55.746
Alex, just let it go. All right?

01:29:55.909 --> 01:29:58.162
"I swear" Just hear
me out, all right?

01:29:59.704 --> 01:30:01.923
- Oh, my God.
- It's just... Listen.

01:30:02.081 --> 01:30:06.507
Now, the path of the explosion determined
the order of our deaths, right?

01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:08.671
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

01:30:08.838 --> 01:30:12.342
it skipped him and went to the next
person in the path. It went to Billy.

01:30:12.509 --> 01:30:14.136
All right, and
then it was Clear.

01:30:14.594 --> 01:30:18.315
But I intervened and saved her, so
it went to me, but in my case...

01:30:18.473 --> 01:30:20.976
no one intervened, right?

01:30:21.142 --> 01:30:24.112
I was thrown from that power
line by the explosion.

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:27.023
- So...
- So why did it skip you, right?

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:30.490
How do we know that this isn't
exactly what was meant to happen?

01:30:30.652 --> 01:30:34.498
That out of everyone on Flight 180,
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:38.038
Maybe that was the
design all along.

01:30:39.077 --> 01:30:41.580
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.127
What? I didn't
make up the rules.

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:46.793
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.214
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:53.554
For all I know, it could circle
back and get us all again.

01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:59.268
But I am the safest fucker in the
world because you're still next.

01:31:04.269 --> 01:31:06.021
Can we just stop
talking about this?

01:31:06.187 --> 01:31:08.440
Let's figure out what
we're gonna do tomorrow.

01:31:24.539 --> 01:31:26.291
I'm gonna meet you
back at the hotel.

01:31:26.457 --> 01:31:29.461
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.

01:31:29.627 --> 01:31:31.254
Okay, Clear?
Just stay here.

01:31:31.421 --> 01:31:32.513
All right?

01:31:32.672 --> 01:31:35.471
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.

01:31:35.633 --> 01:31:36.680
Stop it, Carter.

01:31:36.843 --> 01:31:39.312
- Alex, wait.
- No, Clear, stay there.

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:42.314
Okay?
Stay away.

01:31:49.314 --> 01:31:50.361
Alex!

01:32:09.626 --> 01:32:10.673
Alex!

01:32:14.756 --> 01:32:15.973
I told you, you were next.

01:32:16.716 --> 01:32:19.344
- Then it just skipped me.
- So who's next?
