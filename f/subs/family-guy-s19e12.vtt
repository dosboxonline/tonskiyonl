Chris, you've hardly touched your food.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.373
-Mom, are you a scientist?
-No.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.376
Then quit putting me under
a (bleep) microscope!

00:43.460 --> 00:44.794
Ah, there you are.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.172
Boy, does it feel good
to walk into the right house.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.425
-Hey, Dad, are you a scientist?
-Don’t answer, Peter.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.761
Oh, by the way,
don't make plans for Sunday.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.846
We're taking Stewie
to the children's museum.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.973
Can't go, Lois,
I got tickets to a meaningless

00:57.057 --> 00:58.391
April baseball game.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.602
Now, who wants to come with me
and be as cold as

01:00.685 --> 01:02.187
you've ever been in your whole life?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.813
-I do!
-Awesome.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.983
We're gonna have a great time,
like flies on dog poop.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.818
(buzzing)

01:08.902 --> 01:12.405
Sorry, gentlemen, the dog poop is full.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.532
Come on in, ladies.

01:14.908 --> 01:19.162
To us, lady flies look the same,
but they can tell the difference.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.212
Why is Meg here?

01:27.295 --> 01:30.048
Something happened last week
and she can't be left alone.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.925
Like, legally.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.177
Meg, where you going?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.970
Come on, Meg, you got to stay by me.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.389
I wasn't gonna do anything.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.265
Look, it's just a few months.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.727
-Next.
-Hi. Three adults and one infant, please.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.397
Nice try, lady. That kid's at least three.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.233
What? That's insane.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.901
Brian, do I look old to you?

01:49.984 --> 01:52.779
You look fine.
Guys shouldn't have those, by the way.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.739
But the museum man... Meg wandered off.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.157
That may end up being a problem.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.284
The museum man just said
I looked over two.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.120
That's mid-toddler.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.496
I ain't trying to hear that.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.165
Stewie, who cares?
Let's just enjoy the museum.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.251
Uh-oh, frustrated solo parent.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.670
I want the museum with the pumpkins.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.880
That's the pumpkin patch. It's gone.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.799
-(crying loudly)
-Get up, Holden.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.552
Holden, get... up.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.512
Get up. God!

02:17.595 --> 02:20.890
-Get up and we'll get a toy.
-Yay!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.059
I'm doing the best I can!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.228
(organ playing "Charge")

02:27.939 --> 02:29.524
Excuse us, coming through.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.775
Both fat. Sorry.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.235
All right, we got it.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.361
What is it, bottom of the fourth?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.488
My Lord, it's cold. (gasps)

02:35.572 --> 02:38.700
Chris, look.
Two Irish guys who aren't drinking.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.244
I just got me 30-minute chip.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.998
Well done, lad. Here's to you.

02:45.081 --> 02:48.126
Oh, well, Finnegan begin again.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.961
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Now batting for Boston,

02:50.045 --> 02:51.296
Xander Bogaerts.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.298
(cheers and applause)

02:53.381 --> 02:55.467
All right, Dad, I've got my ball ready

02:55.550 --> 02:57.635
in case Xander hits a glove our way.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.347
Okay, got to talk more sports with you.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.478
(crowd roaring)

03:06.561 --> 03:08.271
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

03:08.355 --> 03:09.939
(organ plays)

03:10.023 --> 03:14.611
ANNOUNCER: Folks, that was
Xander Bogaerts' 200th career home run.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.072
(organ plays)

03:17.155 --> 03:19.532
Heavens to Betsy, what a home run.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.868
Aye. Now let's take offense at something

03:21.951 --> 03:24.037
we thought we heard someone say.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.830
Let's go, Red Sox.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.749
What did you call me?

03:33.713 --> 03:36.091
Now, before you say anything, Brian,

03:36.174 --> 03:37.634
this is very important to me.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.347
Stewie, what the hell
did you do to yourself?

03:42.430 --> 03:43.598
Nothing. Almost nothing.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.600
Just a little Botox, a little filler.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.936
-Maybe some strings.
-Stewie, I can't believe...

03:48.019 --> 03:50.146
Oh, there's Meg. She's wandering outside.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.856
She shouldn't be doing that, right?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.442
Meg, come back inside.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.112
You're not in trouble,
just come back inside.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.198
She should be in her room
thinking about what she did.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.033
Stewie, this face-lift was a big mistake.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.911
Like letting ducks be part
of the Boston Tea Party.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.330
We're gonna storm that ship
and get all the tea

04:07.414 --> 04:08.748
and throw it in the water.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.542
(overlapping shouting)

04:10.625 --> 04:13.461
Yeah, but first we're gonna
storm that other ship

04:13.545 --> 04:16.256
and get all the bread
and throw it in the water.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.717
-Who's with me?
-(overlapping murmurs)

04:18.800 --> 04:21.761
And we got to tear the bread
into bite-size pieces

04:21.845 --> 04:24.764
'cause of... for taxes!

04:27.851 --> 04:30.729
Thanks for taking me
to the baseball game, Dad.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.897
It was so fun to watch the basketball game

04:32.981 --> 04:34.983
on the phone of the guy in front of us.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.402
Yeah, I like that people
are never doing what they're doing.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.071
Hey, you're the dumpy kid
who caught Xander's homer.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.573
I seen it on the jumbotron.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.575
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for it right now.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.368
Oh, I just brought this ball from...

04:45.452 --> 04:50.206
Uh, uh, home. Caught from home.
Home plate, where Xander was.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.083
We're gonna need 300 for it.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.377
Hmm. Well, I guess it's a historic ball.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.213
Okay, you got a deal.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.675
Wow, I can't believe
that guy just paid us $300

05:00.759 --> 05:02.260
for a regular baseball.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.970
Yeah, that was so easy.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.473
Man, people will buy anything
if they think

05:06.556 --> 05:08.058
it's from something famous.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.810
And he didn't even check to see
if that was the real ball.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.520
My God, you're right, Chris.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.023
I bet we could sell
a ton of balls like that,

05:15.106 --> 05:17.484
and maybe other stuff, too,
not just sports.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.487
Hey, what do you say you and me start

05:20.570 --> 05:22.530
a phony memorabilia business?

05:22.614 --> 05:23.990
-I'm in.
-Great.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.368
Now let's walk through
the dangerous part of the city

05:26.451 --> 05:29.412
'cause Daddy didn't want to pay
three extra bucks for parking.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.624
Aah! Boston University guys,
not Harvard guys!

05:32.707 --> 05:33.875
(cries out)

05:33.958 --> 05:37.087
ALL:
Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy...

05:43.093 --> 05:45.637
Hey, Chris, what are you up to?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.306
Just finishing our fake
memorabilia website.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.642
-What's this now?
-From last night.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.352
It was your idea.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.687
Oh, I was blacked out.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.981
-You drove us home.
-Yeah, with the window open.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.442
You see, son, fresh air...
Hey, Meg.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.611
Sweetie, where's your hallway buddy?

06:01.695 --> 06:02.987
Dad, I'm fine.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.948
I know you're fine. I'm fine.
We're all fine.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.991
It's just I'm gonna need you
to go find your hallway buddy.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.744
Okay? There's a good girl.
Thank you.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.752
Oh, my God, your baby is adorable.

06:17.836 --> 06:21.089
-So cute.
-Let me guess, ten months?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.883
Oh, my God, My new look is working.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.511
I'm back into months.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.555
Chris, what's all that lotion for?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.849
Are you a scientist, Mom?

06:30.932 --> 06:34.102
-I'm a scientist.
-It's for masturbating.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.233
Okay, time to hit the road

06:40.316 --> 06:42.277
for the sports and memorabilia convention.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.029
-Ready to go?
-Yep.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.864
All right, here we go.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.284
I have to go to the bathroom.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.702
Chris, we just left.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.454
I know, but I got to go.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.415
Ah, fine.
We'll pull over at Joe's.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.001
-Bathroom's for customers only.
-(sighs)

06:58.084 --> 06:59.544
All right, how much is the gum?

06:59.627 --> 07:01.212
-Four dollars.
-For gum?

07:01.296 --> 07:04.257
-Go somewhere else.
-Fine.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.509
Bathroom code is six-six-four-eight-two-

07:06.593 --> 07:08.678
six-one-zero-three- five-five-four-nine.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.472
Could you-could you say that again?

07:10.555 --> 07:12.182
You got to buy another pack of gum.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.559
(groans)

07:14.642 --> 07:16.227
Six-six-four-eight-two-six-one-

07:18.188 --> 07:19.606

07:19.689 --> 07:20.857
What-What's the rest?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.300
(whispering):
Are you crazy?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.260
You shouldn't claim to have that.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.762
Relax, it's fine.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.098
What are the chances
he tries to steal it back twice?

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
Hey, did he sign your head?

07:57.102 --> 07:59.521
-No.
-He signed my head.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.611
Stewie, you know,
I've been thinking about this whole...

08:06.695 --> 08:09.531
Oh, my God, what happened to your face?

08:09.614 --> 08:12.242
-Stewie?
-Hello? Who's there?

08:12.325 --> 08:15.078
Sorry, Brian, my eyes
don't close when I sleep,

08:15.161 --> 08:17.747
and I'm blind for a few seconds
when I first wake up.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.708
Stewie, you got more plastic surgery?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.459
I know, it was a mistake.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.169
I told you not to do this.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.296
You're way too young
to be getting plastic surgery.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.465
(whistles nasally)

08:27.549 --> 08:29.175
-Stewie!
-What? Who's there?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.594
Sorry, Brian,
my eyes don't close when I sleep,

08:31.678 --> 08:34.055
and I'm blind for a few seconds
when I first wake up.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.432
Yeah, you already said that.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.059
I think one of the cuts
got too close to my brain.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.103
Brian, school pictures are in two days.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.521
What am I gonna do?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.273
All right, don't worry.
Here's what we're gonna do.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.941
(Stewie whistles nasally)

08:45.025 --> 08:46.401
-Stewie!
-Who's there?

08:46.484 --> 08:49.070
Oh, Brian, I need your help.
This is a nightmare.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.531
I couldn't afford
Jennifer Aniston's doctor.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.366
I had to use Kenny Rogers'.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.327
(The Price Is Right
losing horn playing)

09:01.416 --> 09:03.168
Great news, Dad.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.504
Legit Collectibles
just had our biggest sale ever.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.131
Shh, I don't want your mother to hear.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.591
Don't worry, she won't.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.052
She's on the phone
with her dramatic friend Gina.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.304
No, I believe you saw a ghost,

09:14.387 --> 09:17.015
but y-you talked to him for 45 minutes?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.892
Maybe that part was a dream.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.602
Okay, what'd we sell?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.896
You know the captain's hat
we said Sully Sullenberger

09:22.979 --> 09:24.981
was wearing when he landed in the Hudson?

09:25.065 --> 09:28.026
Someone bought it
off our website for five grand.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.528
No way.
What moron paid that much?

09:30.612 --> 09:33.615
Um, someone named Obi-Wan Quagmire.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.575
Obi-Wan Quagmire.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.745
-I wonder if they mean old Glenn Quagmire.
-(knock on door)

09:40.205 --> 09:42.457
Check out my new Sully Sullenberger hat.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.125
And tell Kate to clear the runway

09:44.209 --> 09:46.086
'cause I'm going down on the Hudson.

But you're right.

we're in trouble.

-Would you like any more details?

Dad, I'm an ear salesman.
I got it.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.907

husband of cookie legend Mrs. Fields.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.742

13:48.036 --> 13:50.080
Look, it lets me have
all the cookies I want

13:50.163 --> 13:51.581
and play golf every day.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.999
Okay, I guess you're right.

Happily married, you do what you like.

No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.758
We-we both realized the physical thing

14:01.841 --> 14:03.885
wasn't working for us anymore
and we sleep much better

14:03.968 --> 14:06.346

in the same house.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.265

Dad, you sound like you're gonna cry.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.325
What you keep looking at, Peter?

14:27.409 --> 14:29.244
Do you know about some terror?

14:29.327 --> 14:32.247
No, no, relax.
I'm-I'm just, uh, just curious to see

14:32.330 --> 14:34.416
what Quagmire's gonna be wearing
when he gets here.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.294
(chuckles) I think our outfits
are pretty much set, Pete.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.506
Check it out, guys,
a piece of aviation history:

14:41.589 --> 14:43.425
the cap Sully Sullenberger wore

14:43.508 --> 14:44.968
when he landed in the Hudson River.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.553
Whoa, that's his actual hat?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.847
Yep.
Want to smell Sully's sweat?

14:48.930 --> 14:50.974
(sniffs)
I don't smell anything.

14:51.057 --> 14:55.228
That's right.
‘Cause Sully never sweats.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.647
Is this someone white people know?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.858
I'm gonna get it signed
by the man himself.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.902
Wait, Sully's alive?
And you're gonna show it to him?

15:02.986 --> 15:04.738
Sure am.
He's doing a signing tomorrow

15:04.821 --> 15:06.322
at the airport bookstore.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.491
Uh, hey, listen,
I don't know about this plan, Glenn.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.827
Uh, nobody likes to see their old hats.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.120
Hey, if you're gonna be at the airport,

15:12.203 --> 15:14.039
could you pick me up a $45 neck pillow

15:14.122 --> 15:16.332
I'll forget to pack for my next trip?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.460
-I love this hat.
-You know, Quagmire,

15:18.543 --> 15:20.628
I was gonna be at the airport
tomorrow anyway.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.672
Why don't I take your hat
and get it signed for you?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.215
Why are you going to the airport?

15:24.299 --> 15:25.925
I want to hang out
with the boarding group B

15:26.009 --> 15:27.594
cell phone holster guys.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.137
It's mostly just standing around

15:29.220 --> 15:32.015
and asking each other
if we're also in group B.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.933
Do you also ask if group B
has boarded yet,

15:34.017 --> 15:36.353
and "is this the line
for boarding group B?"

15:36.436 --> 15:38.980
Yeah, you know it, Joe.
Are you a boarding group B guy?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.732
(laughs):
Me? Oh.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.734
No, no, no, no, no.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.987
I, uh, I get on early with the babies.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.280
Look, I'm already gonna be there,

15:47.364 --> 15:49.032
so you should just give me the hat.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.909
Yeah, thanks for the offer,
but I'm not passing up

15:50.992 --> 15:52.827
a chance to meet my hero.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.122
Is this the guy we're talking about?

16:00.919 --> 16:02.712
Wow, I can't believe this.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.256
Daryl Hannah, it is an absolute pleasure.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.093
-I loved you in Splash.
-No, Doctor, this is Stewie.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.969
He needs you to help fix his face.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.596
Oh, absolutely, I can do that.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.807
Great.
Is it a simple procedure?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.101
Oh, sure.
We just break every bone in his face

16:16.184 --> 16:18.395
and then smush 'em back into position.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.231
Dr. Hartman, where'd you
get your medical degree from?

16:21.314 --> 16:24.109
I went to BU.
You know our fight song, right?

16:24.192 --> 16:27.153
♪ Doy, doy, d-doy-doy,
doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy. ♪

16:32.659 --> 16:34.536
All right, Stewie.
You ready?

16:34.619 --> 16:37.497
Wow.
Dr. Hartman really did a good job.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.291
Yep. He told me
bed rest and ice packs for two days

16:40.375 --> 16:43.003
so it can set,
but I'm not missing picture day.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.547
Huh. You sure you shouldn't
listen to the doctor?

16:45.630 --> 16:48.174
-Brian, I know what I'm doing.
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Next.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.346

16:53.430 --> 16:54.431

16:59.019 --> 17:01.438
Oh, my God, Tyler.
Do you remember this?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.482
I do, I do.
We've come a long way.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.360
We've come a lot of ways.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.451
All right, Chris, we got to stop Quagmire

17:14.534 --> 17:16.161
from meeting Captain Sullenberger.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.039
Only thing is, since 9/11,
you can't run in airports,

17:19.122 --> 17:21.833
so we got to fat-guy
hustle-walk our way there.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.509
Oh, no.
We're too late.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.304
We shouldn't have stopped
for that airport Toblerone.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.515
We had to.
It's like European shark teeth.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.937
Hold on, Sully's looking at the hat.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.647
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.983
And it was an honor
to purchase the actual hat

17:47.067 --> 17:48.735
you wore on that fateful day.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.404
-You know, I'm a pilot myself.
-Oh, you are?

17:51.488 --> 17:53.281
What's your record for longest "uh"?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.450
-Eleven seconds.
-Let's hear it.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.536
Folks, from the tower, uh...

18:08.171 --> 18:09.631
...they've cleared us to push back,

18:09.714 --> 18:11.174
we'll be departing shortly.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.469
Hey, that's great.
My personal best is 34 sec...

18:14.552 --> 18:16.471
34 seconds in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.350
I know. The Tulsa Uh.
As I said, big fan.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.939
Here you go.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.651
Thank you, sir.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.573
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go back to my life

18:35.657 --> 18:38.743
as the most famous Chesley
who's ever lived.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.246
This is the greatest day of my life.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.956
(squealing)

18:43.039 --> 18:44.457
-(liquid splatters)
-MAN: Ow, my smoothie.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.460
MAN 2:
Ow, mine, too. I'm on the other side.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.797
I can't believe it.
Sully didn't tell him the hat was fake.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.634
Well, he's not that smart.
He did crash a plane.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.845
Excuse me, uh, Captain Sullenberger,

18:56.928 --> 18:58.638
I was just wondering why you pretended

18:58.722 --> 19:00.390
that was your real hat just then.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.183
-Well, Peter...
-I never said my name.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.977
...when my plane was going down,

19:04.060 --> 19:06.980
I remembered a famous saying
we have in aviation.

19:07.063 --> 19:11.735
It goes, "Chesley is a perfectly
normal name for a person."

19:11.818 --> 19:14.738
And what it means is
you have to believe in yourself.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.490
I didn't think I could
land my plane in the Hudson,

19:17.574 --> 19:19.200
but I believed I could.

19:19.284 --> 19:22.328
And that belief
gave me the courage to try.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.873
So, if that man believes he has my hat,

19:24.956 --> 19:27.584
maybe that'll make him
a little bit better husband...

19:27.667 --> 19:29.002
-Nope.
-Little better dad...

19:29.085 --> 19:30.712
-Nope.
-Little better sex character

19:30.795 --> 19:33.298
who doesn't play as well
in the Me Too era.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.966
Oh, so you do watch the show.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.719
It's on... i-it's on a lot of planes.
