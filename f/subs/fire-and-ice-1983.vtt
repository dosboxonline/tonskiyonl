WEBVTT

02:41.703 --> 02:44.913
And her ambition was to extend her realm...

02:44.998 --> 02:47.166
to all the regions of the known world.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.335
To this end, she gathered an army.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.298
And she bore a son,
and named him Nekron.

02:54.382 --> 02:59.094
And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers ofthe mind.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.264
And when Nekron came ofage...

03:02.348 --> 03:05.058
and attained mastery of those powers...

03:05.143 --> 03:08.854
together they seized control
of the region of Ice.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.356
And from their castle called Ice Peak...

03:11.441 --> 03:14.359
they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.

03:14.444 --> 03:19.156
No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.

03:19.449 --> 03:23.035
And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...

03:23.119 --> 03:26.038
and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...

03:26.122 --> 03:30.751
of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...

03:30.835 --> 03:34.463
from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.717
And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...

03:38.801 --> 03:42.679
into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.058
And no one dared guess at the outcome...

03:46.142 --> 03:49.228
of a meeting on the field of battle...

03:49.312 --> 03:51.480
between Fire and Ice.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.268
Hold your positions, men. Steady.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.574
Larn, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.417
You have done well, my son.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.796
The North Village has fallen. We have won.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.465
I want to thank you, Mother.

07:05.925 --> 07:10.053
The Great Plain is all that stands
between ourselves and Fire Keep.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.681
That is a long distance.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.101
A distance we may not have to travel.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.647
I am sending our envoys to Jarol
with our new demands.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.025
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.071
You will present our demands to King Jarol
at Fire Keep and...

07:28.614 --> 07:31.908
give our royal regards
to his lovely daughter.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.526
But, Father, I want to be with you
when you meet Nekron's men.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.905
You will serve your people better here
with your studies, my daughter.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.364
Give me your love.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.535
You have it always, Father.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.429
All matter in our world
is from the natural bases...

13:26.514 --> 13:29.182
which are earth, air, fire and water...

13:32.311 --> 13:35.688
the four elements
from which all things are created.

13:36.398 --> 13:40.860
How can you talk about elements when
the war draws nearer to us every hour?

13:41.278 --> 13:44.531
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.200
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.

13:47.493 --> 13:52.413
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.834
You mean my duty is to stay shut up...

13:55.918 --> 13:59.295
while all the men do the fighting
and share all the glory.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.049
We think that stinks.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.427
Don't we, Shaitan?

14:06.512 --> 14:10.557
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron
will cease the destruction of-

14:10.641 --> 14:12.141
This is your message of peace?

14:12.226 --> 14:15.311
A demand for our total
and unconditional surrender?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.940
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.817
I call it blackmail.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.236
My lord Nekron's offer-

14:23.320 --> 14:27.282
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.952
King Jarol, be reasonable.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.164
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart
than with his head.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.208
But he speaks for all of us.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.168
There can be no alliance.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.379
We will fight you to the death.

14:41.463 --> 14:46.175
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.478
No!

16:06.840 --> 16:08.091
Teegra!

16:08.759 --> 16:10.051
Guards!

16:23.774 --> 16:26.985
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.070
Hurry!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.093
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.

16:52.886 --> 16:57.765
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.

17:00.227 --> 17:04.021
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.775
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!

25:45.877 --> 25:49.838
What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?

25:50.465 --> 25:53.968
Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.428
Where is she?

25:56.888 --> 25:59.473
Bring her forth that I may see her.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.351
- Gone.
- Gone?

26:03.478 --> 26:04.812
Gone!

26:04.896 --> 26:08.983
Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!

26:13.363 --> 26:16.156
What punishment does failure demand?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.994
Death.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.633
Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.163
Gods of my father.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.914
What do you want?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.264
Ifyou want it, take it.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.730
I am not a thief.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.416
Not so close, you'll burn it.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.918
I've always lived close to a fire.

33:29.090 --> 33:32.676
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.487
It's getting colder.

34:02.290 --> 34:06.251
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.681
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.

34:24.478 --> 34:27.606
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.233
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?

34:30.318 --> 34:33.570
You can come along if you behave yourself.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.112
If I behave myself?

34:38.951 --> 34:40.034
No.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.413
Larn.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.857
You've caught me,
but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.817
You'll have to kill me first.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.282
Don't hunt for death, boy.

37:25.868 --> 37:27.827
It finds us all soon enough.

37:33.584 --> 37:38.171
The travois was to keep you
from killing yourself till you're all healed.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.466
You need rest and food.

37:47.306 --> 37:52.978
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy,
you better learn to live with pain.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.276
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.361
Him and his mother.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.990
That wolf bitch, Juliana.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.253
Teegra!

38:21.132 --> 38:22.716
They were here.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.552
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.388
They took her west.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.233
Guard Teegra.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.777
They camped less than two miles from here.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.111
Come.

41:53.969 --> 41:57.305
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.

41:58.432 --> 42:02.018
You go get her out,
and I'll distract the others.

42:02.102 --> 42:05.980
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.

43:32.568 --> 43:34.944
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.513
- No!
- The horses!

44:02.598 --> 44:05.183
No, they'd be on our heels
before we could reach them.

44:05.267 --> 44:08.478
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.

44:08.562 --> 44:11.189
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs
on a wild chase.

44:11.273 --> 44:12.357
Come.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.245
We'll take our stand up there. Come.

45:14.586 --> 45:15.670
Enough!

45:16.463 --> 45:19.340
I want you to go to Nekron,
to his mother,Juliana.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.969
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?

45:23.971 --> 45:25.430
No man is wholly evil.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.640
Surely there is some way
to appeal to Nekron.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.100
You expect his mercy?

45:30.519 --> 45:34.355
Father, do you know what he will do
if I enter his land under a flag of truce?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.107
We have no choice!

45:36.525 --> 45:37.567
We must take that risk.

45:37.651 --> 45:41.821
You must take that risk, my son,
for the sake of Fire Keep.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.407
For the sake ofyour sister.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.828
Go, ride swiftly.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.606
Welcome to my hearth.

46:16.690 --> 46:19.984
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.

46:20.527 --> 46:23.362
You've had a trying journey.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.450
Please let me give you some food and drink.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.203
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.998
Poor, poor darling.

46:34.374 --> 46:37.502
Did Great Otwa frighten you?

46:37.586 --> 46:42.590
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.307
I saw him twist a chain apart
with his bare hands.

46:51.391 --> 46:54.852
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.

46:55.646 --> 46:59.398
But he means well, my darling .
He brought you to me, did he not?

47:06.490 --> 47:07.657
I'm so tired.

47:07.741 --> 47:11.369
Yes, my poor, poor darling.

47:12.037 --> 47:14.413
Yes, you're so tired...

47:16.124 --> 47:18.125
and so beautiful.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.585
You must...

47:39.982 --> 47:41.774
Tell me your secrets.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.113
Nekron?

47:51.285 --> 47:56.372
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!

47:56.456 --> 47:58.958
She brings danger into my house!

48:05.173 --> 48:08.175
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.

48:09.678 --> 48:11.095
Otwa, my son.

48:12.681 --> 48:16.058
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.936
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.

48:21.106 --> 48:24.233
Tell them he can have her, for a price.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.056
Kill.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.561
Get out of here.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.230
- No.
- The hell you won't.

49:03.398 --> 49:04.774
Go find the girl.

49:42.062 --> 49:44.063
Enter, my son. It is not barred.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.946
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?

49:58.912 --> 50:00.413
You would do this-

50:55.844 --> 50:58.429
Why do the living...

50:58.513 --> 51:01.640
disturb the sleep of the dead?

51:03.935 --> 51:08.481
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.

51:09.649 --> 51:10.900
A girl?

51:11.485 --> 51:16.155
Yes. She did this to me.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.616
She and Nekron.

51:21.161 --> 51:23.454
Cursed Nekron.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.664
Where can I find her?

51:28.668 --> 51:33.089
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.968
Nekron?

51:40.013 --> 51:43.849
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.894
And from there to the Icy King's realm.

51:47.854 --> 51:49.188
Avenge me.

51:50.649 --> 51:54.193
Avenge me!

51:56.154 --> 51:57.530
Akatar.

52:18.051 --> 52:19.718
Teegra!

52:36.653 --> 52:38.737
My Prince, all is arranged.

52:38.822 --> 52:42.158
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.

52:42.367 --> 52:44.451
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.

52:51.084 --> 52:54.962
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!

52:55.380 --> 52:58.048
We must be well on our way before sunrise.

53:11.813 --> 53:14.023
Why have you brought me this?

53:16.693 --> 53:18.903
This is your bride, my son.

53:21.615 --> 53:23.449
She will be mother to your sons.

53:23.533 --> 53:26.619
How thoughtful, Mother.

53:27.495 --> 53:31.290
I need no bride, and no sons.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.669
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing !

53:35.754 --> 53:36.795
Nekron?

53:45.013 --> 53:47.514
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.

53:48.642 --> 53:51.310
You have all that any man ever wants
or needed.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.563
And yet you despair.

53:55.941 --> 53:57.983
For there is one thing you lack.

54:00.195 --> 54:03.656
One gift that only you can bestow
between our people.

54:05.450 --> 54:07.368
Peace.

54:07.452 --> 54:10.371
This is  the gift  that heals the heart
of the giver.

54:11.623 --> 54:15.000
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.337
I offer peace between our people.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.131
Will you not take my hand?

54:25.387 --> 54:27.513
Will you not call me friend?

55:07.220 --> 55:08.220
Woman...

55:09.014 --> 55:12.766
I spit on peace.

55:14.060 --> 55:16.395
I spit on you.

55:22.485 --> 55:26.405
Next time you present me
with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...

55:26.531 --> 55:28.866
I'll squash you like a bug.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.122
Get that garbage out of here.

56:30.470 --> 56:32.137
Don't look up.

56:32.222 --> 56:35.933
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed  to such trash.

57:51.468 --> 57:56.221
We have come, Lord Nekron,
to negotiate between our two peoples.

57:56.556 --> 57:59.349
And the return to Fire Keep
of my sister, Teegra...

57:59.434 --> 58:02.311
whom your warriors basely kidnapped.

58:02.395 --> 58:05.689
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me...

58:06.357 --> 58:08.734
to offer a peace between our kingdoms...

58:10.069 --> 58:13.113
in exchange for his continued sovereignty...

58:13.531 --> 58:15.449
and my sister's freedom.

58:15.533 --> 58:21.246
It seems to me that my envoys made
a similar offer not long since...

58:22.123 --> 58:25.542
and  that it was spurned
by your illustrious sire.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.794
You know full well, Nekron,
that offer was made...

58:27.879 --> 58:30.297
before your minions kidnapped my sister.

58:30.381 --> 58:33.800
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people...

58:33.885 --> 58:37.679
who have refused to proclaim me
their rightful overlord.

58:40.892 --> 58:43.227
As to your sister...

58:43.895 --> 58:46.605
I must admit that until this moment...

58:46.689 --> 58:50.609
the idea of mating with her
filled me with loathing.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.278
Perhaps I should reconsider.

58:54.489 --> 58:57.282
Your sister, after all,
is not wholly unattractive.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.286
As lesser beasts go.

59:18.805 --> 59:21.139
Pig you are.

59:21.224 --> 59:23.809
And like a pig shall you die.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:33.045
No!

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.238
No, I don't think so.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.877
You interest me.

01:01:13.961 --> 01:01:16.338
Guards!

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:18.256
Bring him to me.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.262
Release him.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:39.403
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.948
We've had to dispose of
so many undesirables of late.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:16.124
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:13.598
Larn.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.145
Teegra, is that you?

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:23.692
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:25.443
Never mind the door,
you've to get out of here.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.488
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:29.990
No, Teegra, don't.

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:19.617
Is he certain?

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:23.747
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.749
He died.

01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:31.796
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.673
Maybe she's still alive.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:34.841
It's a chance.

01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:38.303
Believe what you want,
but that glacier is a fact.

01:07:41.098 --> 01:07:43.975
For three days and nights
it's been pushing south.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:48.563
A thousand souls lost
because of  Nekron's rage.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:52.275
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.277
I need the Dragonhawks.

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:58.073
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.785
One us might get through and destroy him.

01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:07.332
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.084
I will have to release the lava.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:31.763
Teegra.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.960
Larn.

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.179
Nekron!

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:58.474
Die! Die! Why don't you die?

01:17:14.254 --> 01:17:17.381
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
