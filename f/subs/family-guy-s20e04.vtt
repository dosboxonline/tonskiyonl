Welcome to tumbling class.

00:35.618 --> 00:36.953
Moms, please enjoy,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.456
while dads grumble
about how much the class costs.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.334
240 bucks for a mat and a room.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.835
Now let's all gather 'round

00:43.918 --> 00:46.004
because Stewie is gonna do a somersault.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.974
Nailed it.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.352
Well, that's basically fine,
and I don't honestly care,

01:00.435 --> 01:04.731
so unless there's an
unexpected appearance from a rival baby...

01:04.814 --> 01:07.233
Perhaps <i>I</i> could take a shot.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.443
- It's Doug!

01:08.526 --> 01:09.778
That's Stewie's rival.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.237
What are you doing here, Doug?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.323
Eh, thought I'd give
this tumbling thing a try.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.033
So what do I do, just fall down

01:15.116 --> 01:17.327
like literally anyone affected by gravity?

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
Um, there's a bit more to it than that.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.081
One can't just show up
and hope to execute,

01:21.164 --> 01:22.582
say, a perfect somers...

01:23.958 --> 01:25.752
Oh, oh, he's very good!

01:27.587 --> 01:29.172
Hmm. Something like that?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.132
- Wow!
- Now that's tumbling!

01:31.216 --> 01:33.718
Boys can be good at this till nine,
then the whispers start.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.595
Calm down, it wasn't that great.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.847
Stewie, give Doug your shirt and overalls.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.265
He's my son now.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.521
<i>We now return
to Christopher Nolan's</i> Tenet.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.980
I'm already completely lost.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.275
Dad, can I ask you something about girls?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.610
Are you wearing a wire?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.570
There's a girl in my class
I have a crush on,

01:52.654 --> 01:54.447
and I can't get her to notice me.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.658
Ah, now I understand.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.328
Lucky for you,
there's a bunch of old movies

02:00.412 --> 02:01.746
on this very subject.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.623
Here. <i>Sixteen Candles.</i>

02:03.707 --> 02:05.709
<i>Can't Buy Me Love, Say Anything...</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:08.420
all on very inconvenient VHS.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.256
VHS? What do those letters stand for?

02:11.339 --> 02:13.633
That information has been lost to history.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.427
Anyway, Chris, just watch these movies

02:15.510 --> 02:17.721
and do what the 28-year-old teenagers do.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.305
I guess I could try.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.809
After all, they tried to do <i>Superman</i>
in Boston once.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.729
I've noticed that you're never around
when Superman's here.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.689
Are... are you Superman?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.315
What is ya, wacked in the head?

02:29.399 --> 02:31.693
I'm Clahk. Plain ol' Clahk.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.279
Okay, back to our Boston newspaper job.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.322
<i>-Spotlight.</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:37.824
What?!

02:44.247 --> 02:45.582
Show-and-tell time.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.667
Finally a chance to reclaim my honor

02:47.751 --> 02:49.502
after that whole tumbling fiasco.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.130
Stewie.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.340
Hello, everyone.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.967
This is a weird seashell

02:56.051 --> 02:57.969
that kind of looks like female genitalia

02:58.053 --> 02:59.220
that my dad likes.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.847
Lois, where's my she shell?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.141
Oh, Stewie took it to show-and-tell.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.268
Well, I hope no one puts it to their ear.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.686
Incredible, right?

03:11.232 --> 03:12.609
Thank you, Stewie.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.904
And, so you know,
many middle-aged women have seashells

03:15.987 --> 03:17.405
in their powder rooms.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.783
Okay, next up is Doug.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.451
Hello, gang,

03:21.534 --> 03:24.579
and have I got some show-and-tell for you.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.082
This is a ticket stub from a PG movie

03:27.165 --> 03:28.958
that I got to see in the theater...

03:29.042 --> 03:30.335
alone.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.795
Wow!

03:31.878 --> 03:34.381
Also, I've been on a Disney cruise.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.591
Hey, who's this in the picture with Moana?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.677
Oh, me? Huh.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.680
No way!
Moana is famously agoraphobic.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.140
Yes, but she's managing it day by day,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.600
thanks to CBD oil.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.519
This cruise was a big step for her.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.937
Okay, I think we can all agree that

03:49.020 --> 03:50.438
these are very lame show-and-tell...

03:50.522 --> 03:53.650
And finally, a piece of candy
from the London airport.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.277
Aw, a Lion Bar?

03:56.361 --> 03:58.947
I'm sorry, did I say "a piece of candy"?

03:59.030 --> 04:02.283
More like British candy
for the whole class!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.828
Drumstick Squashies
and rose-flavored wine gums

04:04.911 --> 04:06.705
- for everyone!

04:06.788 --> 04:08.915
Hello,
Show-and-Tell National Championships

04:08.998 --> 04:12.544
in DeKalb, Illinois,
I have a nominee for you.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.046
Dammit.
I'm sick of being one-upped by Doug.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.464
Hurts.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.883
It hurts worse than
a trip to the barber shop.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.473
This is what babies
think happens at haircuts!

04:30.645 --> 04:32.522
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Burbeck.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.065
Do you have a daughter named Jennifer,

04:34.149 --> 04:36.693
who is currently smeared across Highway 9?

04:36.776 --> 04:37.902
Joe, it's us.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.696
Oh, sorry.
That's my next stop.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.449
Peter, your son was lurking
outside a classmate's window

04:42.532 --> 04:45.118
with this boom box, playing Peter Gabriel.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.412
He's being charged with felony stalking.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.373
I also tried to use science
to make a sex slave

04:50.457 --> 04:52.125
from a magazine photo.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.002
Oh, this is horrifying!

04:54.085 --> 04:56.338
- Actually, it's the '80s.
- What?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.757
Well, it appears that someone
has exposed your son

04:58.840 --> 05:03.136
to the very problematic
teen films of the 1980s.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.513
Peter, tell me it wasn't you.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.307
Honestly, Lois, I have no idea.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.267
My brain can't even think thoughts no more

05:09.351 --> 05:11.561
-'cause of the Internet.
- Ugh, that's it.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.189
From now on, you are an outside Peter.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.482
Go on! Get!

05:15.565 --> 05:16.941
Outside!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.865
Go to your Peter house.
Go to your Peter house!

05:37.003 --> 05:38.630
God, look at Doug over there,

05:38.713 --> 05:40.423
throwing a Frisbee
with the kindergarteners

05:40.507 --> 05:42.217
and a shorter-than-average first-grader.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.302
- Thinks he's so cool.
- Yup.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.805
There must be some way
I can finally one-up that guy,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.932
and you're clearly
looking for cat turds right now.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.226
Yup. Y... Huh?
Wait, uh, wait.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.853
Aw, gum.
- Help me out, man.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.980
I need something to win back
everyone's attention.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.440
Wait, I know!

05:57.524 --> 05:59.567
What if I flip my eyelids inside out?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.403
Show everyone what a freak I am.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.988
Huh?
I could carve this out.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.407
Right?
This could be my thing.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.866
I don't think so, Stewie.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.661
All right, well what if I just,
like, do Doug's mom?

06:09.744 --> 06:11.996
Uh... Y...
I-I mean, yeah, yeah, that...

06:12.080 --> 06:13.707
I mean, that would...
that would pretty much do it.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.084
Awesome! How do you
dial a phone or have sex?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.169
Or stand up without using your hands?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.173
Let me tell you something, Brian...

06:30.015 --> 06:30.890
Oh, no!

06:32.308 --> 06:34.811
You said it,
relatively-short-first-grader.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.730
That Frisbee is way up there.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.898
I'm too scared to climb up that high.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.276
Me, too, average-height-kindergartener.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.445
That jungle gym dates back to the 1930s,

06:43.528 --> 06:45.405
when the lives of children
were expendable.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.699
Someone would have to be crazy
to climb up there.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.908
I'll do it.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.160
What?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.661
I'll climb up there and get that Frisbee.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.872
Doug may be afraid, but I'm not.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.166
Just give me a day
to get prepared and gear up,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.460
and at sunrise tomorrow,
I will climb up there

06:58.543 --> 07:00.003
and retrieve that Frisbee.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.963
Or we can ask Spider-Man to do it.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.299
He came to my birthday party.
I know him.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.551
That wasn't the real Spider-Man.
That was your dad.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.970
We could see his hernia
popping through the suit.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.388
Hey, Tyler!

07:10.472 --> 07:13.475
Heard Spider-Man
had a pretty good time at your party.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.317
Don't mind me, Brian.
Just pushing the edge.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.777
Hmm.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.195
14 zippers, if you must know,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.905
but it's not about my pants, Brian.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.823
It's about my fearlessness and pants.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.325
Now, I need to plan out

07:30.408 --> 07:32.369
every last inch of my climb tomorrow.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.746
If I do this right,
I'm gonna be remembered forever,

07:34.829 --> 07:37.082
like 9/11 was for a few years.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.375
You're just climbing a jungle gym.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.835
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

07:40.919 --> 07:42.921
I pull this off, I go down in history!

07:43.004 --> 07:46.132
The Guy
Who Was Hanged Next to Nathan Hale.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.804
I regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.014
If you kill me,
I'm gonna immediately void.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.351
All over here. All over here.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.145
You, historian,
write down both our things.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.985
Hey, Lois, how about
we get a little three-way going?

08:06.069 --> 08:09.030
- You, me and the seashell?
- Oh, forget it, Peter.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.865
After that whole
thing with the '80s movies,

08:10.949 --> 08:12.325
I'm very upset with you.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.703
Well, can you use that anger in the sex?

08:14.786 --> 08:18.373
No, Peter, your '80s nostalgia
isn't funny anymore.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.543
It's tired and worn out,
and borderline dangerous.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.045
I mean, those old references
just don't play

08:24.129 --> 08:26.923
- the same in today's world.
- What you talkin' 'bout, Lois?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.801
This!
This is exactly what I'm talking about!

08:29.884 --> 08:32.429
When are you gonna let the '80s go?

08:32.512 --> 08:35.432
Never!
The '80s will always be the best decade.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.933
And I'm confident

08:37.017 --> 08:38.727
that non-whites and women
would agree with that.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.021
Everyone else, too.
And I'm gonna prove it.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.815
Family!
Come here conveniently fast, please!

08:43.898 --> 08:44.899
What is it, Peter?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.609
I have decided to prove to you all

08:46.693 --> 08:49.237
that the '80s are still relevant
and hilarious.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.449
- But they're not.
- And in keeping with the wonderful 1980s,

08:52.532 --> 08:55.035
I'm gonna go upstairs
and drill a hole in the wall

08:55.118 --> 08:56.619
to watch girls shower.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.372
Peter, in addition to that
being wildly problematic,

08:59.456 --> 09:01.875
you can't just drill a hole
in a structural wall.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.336
Do you even know how to do that?

09:04.419 --> 09:07.922
Okay, that's one drywall bit,
one masonry bit,

09:08.006 --> 09:10.842
one spur point bit, one tile bit,

09:10.925 --> 09:13.261
one drill with a hammer action setting,

09:13.345 --> 09:15.889
one wire detector, one stud finder,

09:15.972 --> 09:17.432
and one grease pencil.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.893
Sounds like someone's
drilling a hole in the wall

09:19.976 --> 09:21.394
to watch girls shower.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.646
- Oh, big time.
- Did you pull a permit?

09:23.730 --> 09:24.898
City hall's next.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.733
Nice!

09:34.866 --> 09:37.660
♪ <i>I'm all right</i> ♪

09:37.744 --> 09:40.080
♪ <i>Nobody worry about me.</i> ♪

09:43.166 --> 09:45.335
Oh, my God!
What did you do?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.462
He was supposed to get away.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.798
It was gonna be harmless '80s fun.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.424
You killed the gopher!

09:51.508 --> 09:54.135
- He's all right?
- No! He's not all right!

09:54.219 --> 09:55.553
We're all gonna get laid?

09:55.637 --> 09:56.930
Dammit, Peter!

09:57.013 --> 09:59.683
Stop saying blandly upbeat things
from the movie!

09:59.766 --> 10:01.309
This has to stop!

10:01.393 --> 10:02.936
You're right.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.146
Man, and I was so sure
that stuff from the '80s

10:05.230 --> 10:06.898
would still play the same today.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.608
I guess people are only interested in that

10:08.692 --> 10:10.443
for 19 seasons.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.903
Hi, I'm Kenny Loggins,

10:11.986 --> 10:14.364
and I'm still very interested
in '80s references.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.741
Every time <i>Family Guy</i>
plays one of my songs,

10:16.825 --> 10:19.077
I get a new hot tub for my Colorado deck.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.788
♪ <i>I'm all right</i> ♪

10:21.871 --> 10:24.374
♪ <i>Nobody worry about me.</i> ♪

10:26.626 --> 10:29.379
All right, you guys ready
to watch some history be made

10:29.462 --> 10:30.755
by Stewie Griffin?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.549
And guest?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.427
What the...?
11, 12, 13...

10:35.510 --> 10:38.054
15 zippers! You've got to be
kidding me!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.597
What do you say, Stewie?

10:39.681 --> 10:42.142
A friendly race to the top
in front of all these kids,

10:42.225 --> 10:44.811
plus the red-haired girl
from the Charlie Brown cartoons?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.856
Aw.
I care about her opinion most of all!

10:47.939 --> 10:49.274
You don't care about me.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.526
You just wanted
to wear my ballerina skirt.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.570
I especially love her sense of humor

10:53.653 --> 10:55.321
and inventive storytelling.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.533
Okay, you're on.
First to the Frisbee wins.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.245
You realize, Doug,
we might die up there today.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.040
Then I'll see you in heck.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.597
Okay,
Dried Booger Ridge.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.276
The Frisbee!

11:42.911 --> 11:44.788
Yes! I win!

11:44.871 --> 11:48.333
♪ <i>I'm going all the way</i> ♪

11:48.416 --> 11:52.420
♪ <i>Sooner or later gotta love somebody.</i> ♪

11:53.505 --> 11:54.839
Wha...?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.762
Oh, no! Help! Help!

12:01.846 --> 12:03.682
Help me!

12:03.765 --> 12:05.975
What?
We can't hear you!

12:06.059 --> 12:10.105
Our voices are very faint
because we are so distant!

12:10.188 --> 12:12.065
Distant from you, he means!

12:12.148 --> 12:13.858
We're not distant from each other!

12:13.942 --> 12:16.152
We're standing relatively close together!

12:16.236 --> 12:18.947
You probably were already
able to infer that,

12:19.030 --> 12:21.825
and Connor just wasted everyone's time!

12:21.908 --> 12:23.410
My God. I...

12:23.493 --> 12:24.953
I'm stuck up here.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.038
Better use my emergency flare.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.669
We've got a flare.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.298
I'm still stuck,
but now I have confidence.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.098
My foot is still stuck,

12:45.181 --> 12:46.725
and it's really starting to hurt.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.935
And I know you're going
to be insufferable about this.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.353
Stewie, come on.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.272
Right now your safety is what matters.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.691
And you've got an owie
in need of attention.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.777
I'm gonna have to radio basecamp
for help on my Elmo phone.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.197
<i>Elmo love you so much!</i>

13:01.281 --> 13:03.074
Basecamp.
Come in, basecamp.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.409
<i>Elmo your friend.</i>

13:04.492 --> 13:05.785
Elmo, we've got a man down.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.537
I need you to connect me
with search and rescue.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.706
<i>Please don't believe rumors about Elmo.</i>

13:09.789 --> 13:13.209
Just to be safe,
Elmo play with you at least 500 yards

13:13.293 --> 13:15.670
<i>-from school or public park...</i>
- I'm having trouble hearing you, Elmo.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.005
<i>- Are you there?</i>

13:17.088 --> 13:18.923
Elmo? Elmo?

13:19.007 --> 13:21.426
Hello?
Dammit, I've lost basecamp.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.262
Must be interference
from that big storm coming.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.059
Too dangerous to risk going for help now.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.394
I think we're gonna
have to wait it out, Stewie.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.314
Just you and me, and the homeless people

13:34.397 --> 13:36.775
who live and copulate
in the playground among children.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.943
Yes, we as a society
have clearly just decided

13:39.027 --> 13:40.445
we're gonna roll with that.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.745
Peter, what are you doing?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.622
Well, you know how you told me
to give up the '80s

13:50.705 --> 13:53.166
and find a whole different decade
to be into?

13:53.249 --> 13:56.086
- No, that's not what I...
- Well, I'm doin' the 1920s!

13:56.169 --> 13:59.756
Not 'cause of legal cocaine
but mostly 'cause of legal cocaine.

14:02.133 --> 14:05.095
Time to design
a very stupid flying contraption.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.307
- Cocaine plane!

14:14.479 --> 14:17.899
Um, why is Dad dressed like that now?

14:17.982 --> 14:22.862
Oh, Lord, Peter, did you switch
to the 1910s for silent movies?

14:33.498 --> 14:35.291
Enough of this!

14:35.375 --> 14:37.961
Oh, you are so damned exhausting, Peter!

14:38.044 --> 14:40.588
Just 'cause you stop
being crazy about one decade

14:40.672 --> 14:42.882
doesn't mean
you have to be crazy about another!

14:42.966 --> 14:46.094
How about you just
be a normal human being for once?!

14:46.177 --> 14:48.680
Huh? Just be a...
be a husband to your wife!

14:48.763 --> 14:50.807
Be a father to your children!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.392
You're right, Lois.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.019
No matter how hard I try,

14:54.102 --> 14:56.021
I'll never find a decade
as good as the '80s,

14:56.104 --> 14:57.480
like you just said just now.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.357
No, again, that's not at all what I...

14:59.441 --> 15:01.526
I need to be alone.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
If anyone calls, I'll be in the '70s

15:03.445 --> 15:05.905
doing the might-as-well-be-legal cocaine.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.076
<i>the winner of the war on drugs.</i>

15:14.164 --> 15:16.249
Thank you for taking care of me, Doug.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.877
Look, Stewie, I want to apologize.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.545
You do?
For what?

15:20.628 --> 15:23.423
For always showing you up
and just being a jerk.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.593
I think I'm just intimidated
by your brilliance.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.387
Plus, it's so great
you've only got nine hairs.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.638
It probably takes you three seconds

15:30.722 --> 15:31.848
to get ready in the morning.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
Me, I've got this whole head of hair.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.269
That's not quite as nice
as you meant for it to sound,

15:36.353 --> 15:38.688
but since we're confessing
our insecurities...

15:38.772 --> 15:41.900
I'm not exactly the, um, I don't know,

15:41.983 --> 15:44.444
"slick cucumber" everyone thinks I am.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.488
-"Slick cucumber"?
- I mean, sure,

15:46.571 --> 15:48.907
maybe on the outside,
but I can only wish I had

15:48.990 --> 15:52.911
- that slick cucumber deep inside...
- I'm getting lost, here, Stewie.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.412
Like, sometimes I mention having

15:54.496 --> 15:56.414
a supermodel girlfriend in Norway.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.750
Well I... I'm gonna be honest, um,

15:58.833 --> 16:00.585
she's not a supermodel.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.545
She's basically mid-level, at best.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.131
Like, she's kind of a pocket client
at some agencies,

16:05.215 --> 16:06.925
but it's so political
over there in Sweden.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.010
Thought you said Norway.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.970
Meanwhile,
you're this cool kid on the block.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.931
You're all confident.
You can snap.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.432
You mean this?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.685
Yeah, that's like bloody witchcraft to me.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.728
Anyway, deep down, I...

16:18.812 --> 16:20.897
I-I've always wanted your approval.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.358
But now, tonight,

16:23.441 --> 16:26.403
you've given me something

16:26.486 --> 16:27.862
your friendship.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.658
- Here. You can have it.
- What?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.201
I don't need the Frisbee anymore.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.412
Take it, friend.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.508
I won, everyone!
I won!

16:48.591 --> 16:51.052
Other kids, Stewie lost,

16:51.136 --> 16:53.346
and he deserves our ridicule!

16:53.430 --> 16:54.806
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

16:54.889 --> 16:56.850
And there was a weird cucumber thing!

16:56.933 --> 16:58.309
That son of a bitch.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.813
Come back here!

17:04.941 --> 17:07.360
Oh, you can do it, Stewie, for sure.

17:07.444 --> 17:11.489
Free your foot,
and together we will bump wieners.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.242
But it's stuck,
Norwegian Mid-Level Model Girlfriend.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.328
Oh, just untie your shoe, is how.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.913
Oh! Duh!

17:20.749 --> 17:23.084
Stewie, when will you free me

17:23.168 --> 17:24.919
from this thought bubble hell?

17:25.003 --> 17:26.254
Not for a while.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.465
I may need you if I run for office.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.348
- Stewie!
- You were manipulating me.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.433
You were only being nice
to get the Frisbee!

17:38.516 --> 17:42.937
Sorry, Stewie, but all's fair
in love and jungle gyms.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.698
Ha!

17:54.949 --> 17:56.951
- Wh-Wh-Whoa!
- Doug!

18:01.706 --> 18:03.708
Please hang on, Stewie!

18:03.792 --> 18:05.251
I've got this, my friend.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.755
This is when that slick cucumber
deep inside of me comes out.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.092
- Oh... okay.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.928
You're gonna hate me,
but I really need to take this.

18:15.011 --> 18:15.929
Don't you dare!

18:16.012 --> 18:17.389
But it might be Bruce Lee

18:17.472 --> 18:19.974
finally calling to admit
that I'm the best at kung fu!

18:20.058 --> 18:22.560
- This is your one chance, Stewie.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.230
I will not call you a second time.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.489
Who am I if I can't reference the '80s?

18:34.572 --> 18:37.992
If I can't live in the past,
there's no future for me.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.162
Boy, who knew when you stop doing cocaine,

18:41.246 --> 18:43.289
- you get depressed?
Peter.

18:46.126 --> 18:50.005
The ghost
of '80s film director John Hughes?

18:50.088 --> 18:53.800
Yes, Peter.
I've come to tell you that Lois is right.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.219
You need to let the '80s go.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.054
But... I don't understand.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.807
Listen, when we were
making art in the 1980s,

19:00.890 --> 19:03.601
we were just having fun
and trying new things.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.021
Stop recreating the '80s, Peter.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.147
They're gone.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.691
Get out there and make your own '80s.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.276
Today.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.617
After all, life moves pretty fast.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.120
If you don't stop
and look around once in a while,

19:22.203 --> 19:24.664
- you could miss it.
- Ah! Like the movie!

19:24.748 --> 19:26.374
I have to go, Peter.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.501
- Goodbye.
- Wait! Wait!

19:28.585 --> 19:29.794
You want to know my favorite thing

19:29.878 --> 19:31.463
from any of your movies ever?

19:31.546 --> 19:33.965
- Was it the giant pancake?
- Yes, the giant pancake!

19:34.049 --> 19:36.051
In heaven, are the pancakes big

19:36.134 --> 19:37.385
like they are in <i>Uncle Buck</i> ?

19:37.469 --> 19:38.678
I wouldn't know, Peter.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.889
I'm currently frying in hell.

19:40.972 --> 19:44.017
What?!
But-but you were pretty good.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.480
You have to be very good!

19:51.733 --> 19:54.194
Doug, I can't hold on much longer.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.406
It's been an honor, friend.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.536
Oh. W-We weren't...
we weren't very high up there.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.914
No, I guess it just seemed higher to us,

20:05.997 --> 20:08.375
because of perspective and what-have-you.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.002
At any rate...
Hey, gang? Gang!

20:11.086 --> 20:12.087
Here's your Frisbee.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.923
Stewie and I got it...

20:15.006 --> 20:17.676
- together.
- Yes. Together.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.594
We're different kids from before,

20:19.678 --> 20:21.763
so that means nothing to us.

20:28.269 --> 20:31.022
- We had quite the adventure.
- Yes, we did.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.982
And at the end of it all, I, uh...

20:33.066 --> 20:34.359
I hope we've come to see each other

20:34.442 --> 20:36.277
through slightly different eyes.

20:36.361 --> 20:37.987
We certainly have.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.280
Hey, who knows?

20:39.364 --> 20:41.241
Maybe someday
they'll make a movie about us.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.995
<i>This summer,
don't miss</i> Jungle Gym Mountain,

20:46.079 --> 20:48.164

20:52.085 --> 20:53.169

I crapped my pants,

20:55.588 --> 20:58.341
- and I'm afraid of heights.
- I'm out of here.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.928
<i>And Chris Hemsworth
