Sorry, I couldn't find a sitter.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.639
So, I ran some tests and it's official:

03:42.722 --> 03:43.848
you all have the flu.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.767
But luckily you got here in time.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.477
Doc, this is very important.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.813
How long before she can make dinner again?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.439

Okay, good.
I can egg my way through that.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.322
I actually wanted to talk to you, Peter.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.533
It's very rare
that someone would be around

04:01.616 --> 04:03.952
so many infected people
and not get sick themselves.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.495
So I went ahead and tested you

04:05.578 --> 04:07.122
and I found something very interesting.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.289
(dog whimpering)

Sadie, quiet.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.130
Peter, you appear to have
a very strong immune system.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.131
Kegels.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.549
-What?
-I don't know.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.968
Anyway, this flu season
has decimated the hospital,

04:20.051 --> 04:21.636
and we're severely short-staffed.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.722
How would you like to be a male nurse?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.141
Do I get to wear those
green pajama clothes all day?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.892
-Yes.
-I'll do it!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.978
Wow.
I've never helped anyone before.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.731
Well, except for that time
I picked the last piece of bread.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.941
Whoa.
You picked me.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.860
I've been skipped and flipped

04:36.943 --> 04:38.486
and reached over so many times,

04:38.570 --> 04:40.071
I wasn't sure I'd ever get out.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.698
So, what are you gonna put on me?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.408
Jelly?
Cream cheese?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.743
Maybe some nut butters?

04:44.826 --> 04:47.120
Actually, I'm just using you
to squish a spider.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.246
Aw.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.248
Yuck.
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.334
(birds chirping)

04:55.211 --> 04:57.797
You know, last week's
flu scare got me thinking.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.799
I don't know anything
about my genetic makeup

04:59.883 --> 05:02.135
or what other illnesses
I might be susceptible to.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.262
You know who'd love this story?
Chris.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.349
So, it made me
want to do a 23andMe genetic test.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.601
-Chris!
-It says I'm predisposed

05:09.684 --> 05:10.935
to like caffeine.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.771
So true, so true.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.606
I can't even function without my caff.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.857
I get all grr.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.275
How many more of these are there?

05:17.359 --> 05:19.110
Whew, don't have the Alzheimer's gene.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.695
That's good.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.614
And it says
I don't have the Alzheimer's gene,

05:22.697 --> 05:23.948
so that's good.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.075
Hmm.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.076
Wait, what was that?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
It was nothing.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.163
Oh, my God.
Brian.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.540

05:33.625 --> 05:34.959

05:35.043 --> 05:36.586
-What?!
-Whoa!

05:36.670 --> 05:38.171
I was just kidding about the Black thing.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.091
That was a test and you...

05:47.347 --> 05:48.473

05:48.556 --> 05:49.974

05:50.058 --> 05:51.976

05:52.060 --> 05:53.311
I am.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.354
Meg.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.523
M-Mug...

05:56.606 --> 05:58.692
So, how's this gonna work, Dad?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.360
You don't know anything about medicine.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.986
Oh, there's a lot more to being a nurse

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
than medical mumbo jumbo.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.032
For example, what's the next holiday?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.117
Memorial Day.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.868
-The next one.
-Fourth of July.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.787
-Say "Christmas."
-Christmas.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.080
-(bell jingles)
-Eh?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.373
That's good nursing.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.958
Yeah, I agree with Chris.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.043
I don't think you have
the makeup to be a nurse.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.795
-You're impatient...
-Are you done?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.296
...and you faint when you see blood.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.799
I got over that.
Pass the ketchup.

"Oh, don't buy a fainting couch, Stewie.

06:28.179 --> 06:31.307

is gonna need a fainting couch, Stewie."

06:35.729 --> 06:37.313
Hey, Stewie.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.692

06:40.775 --> 06:42.193
Was that a cat stretch?

06:42.277 --> 06:43.820
Oh, my God, is that what that looks like?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.155
I mean, you said it.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.240
I guess that DNA report
was right on the money.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.286

06:51.369 --> 06:53.038
What are you...
Are you purring?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.748
Do you really think you're a cat?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.958
Yeah.
No, I... I don't know.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.543
Okay?
I-I just feel different.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.836
I don't care what that report said.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.171
You're not a cat.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.757
You're what's called
a pretentious absorber.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.426
-What's that?
-You remember how Madonna lived in London

07:06.509 --> 07:08.219
for, like, a month
and then started talking

07:08.303 --> 07:09.471
with a British accent?

07:09.554 --> 07:10.722
It's that.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.265
If I weren't a cat,

07:12.349 --> 07:14.017
would I be obsessed
with this scratch post?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.685
That's not a scratch post.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.228

07:17.312 --> 07:20.065
(intensely):
Don't stop.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.237
Peter, welcome to your first day.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.323
Doc, this may sound silly, but...

07:28.406 --> 07:30.325
(Southern accent):
what do I do?

07:30.408 --> 07:32.077
As a nurse, it's important to know

07:32.160 --> 07:34.162
how every department in a hospital works.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.040
So today I need you to observe surgery.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.208
(monitor beeping steadily)

07:38.291 --> 07:40.293
PETER:
Boo!

07:40.377 --> 07:43.755

better than you!

07:48.718 --> 07:50.470

07:56.559 --> 07:58.311

07:58.395 --> 07:59.396
I'm your nurse.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.649
So, what brings you in today, Mr....

08:02.732 --> 08:04.901
-Quagmire?
-Look, I-I don't really feel comfortable

08:04.984 --> 08:07.570

problems with one of my buddies.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.822
Can I get a different nurse?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.281
You're in a hospital, Glenn.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.450
Anything you say
is private and confidential

08:12.534 --> 08:14.703
-and legally protected by HIPAA...
-Don't say it.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.582
-So, what's your problem?
-(sighs)

08:19.666 --> 08:21.793
Okay.
So, I was at home watching Mrs. Fletcher.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.379
-Mm-hmm.
-It's a pretty sexually-driven show,

08:24.462 --> 08:26.631
-and it kinda gets me going.
-Right, right.
-(keys clacking, message sends)

08:26.715 --> 08:28.425
-(clacking)
-So, I'm pretty revved up
and I decide to...

08:28.508 --> 08:30.176
-you know.
-Sure.
-(message sends)

08:30.260 --> 08:31.678
-(phone chiming)
-And I don't have a prayer of finishing

08:31.761 --> 08:32.762
-unless I kick it up a few notches.
-(clacking)

08:32.846 --> 08:34.681
-Like, weird notches.
-Uh-huh.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.642
-So I look over at my side table
and I see the Apple TV remote
-(chiming)

08:37.726 --> 08:39.561
-and I think, "Well, that could work."
-Right.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.147
-(clacking, sending)
-Before I know it,
I've got six Apple TV remotes

08:42.230 --> 08:44.232
-taped together and my
foot behind my head.
-Got it.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.276
And just as I get everything...
you know...

08:46.359 --> 08:48.236
-(rapid chiming)
-'Kay.
-...Mrs. Fletcher ends

08:48.319 --> 08:50.321
-and Watchmen starts, which scares me...
-Mm. Wow.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.741
...but now it's too late
because everything's... you know.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.492
-Oh, my stars.
-(phone buzzes)

08:54.576 --> 08:56.578
Uh, hold on a second.
I got a text.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.923
-What do we got?
-Suspected heart attack.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.508
He's not breathing.
No pulse.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.344

19:36.760 --> 19:38.845
Every day, I wake up
not knowing if you're gonna

19:38.928 --> 19:40.513
come out of nowhere
and punch me in the face.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.515
I flinch every time a door opens.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.975
I look over my shoulder

19:44.059 --> 19:46.061
every time I bend down to tie my shoes.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.897
And I flip my porch light on
every night before I go to bed

19:48.980 --> 19:50.940
just to see if you're standing there.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.942
Do you have any idea how exciting that is?

19:53.026 --> 19:56.404
So I didn't save your life
because I like you.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.490
I saved it because...

19:58.573 --> 20:00.658
because I hate you.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.912
I hate you, too, Peter Griffin.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.206
Also, if you die,
I'll be solely responsible

20:06.289 --> 20:08.958
for all the destruction
we've caused over the years,

20:09.042 --> 20:11.628
so this decision
is both emotional and financial.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.797
You can give him
his medicine now, Dr. Hartman.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.715
You haven't been giving him his medicine?!

20:15.799 --> 20:18.760
Nah, I'm scared of needles
so I've been faking all my nursing.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.306
This guy's nuts.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.238
(refrigerator humming)

20:44.119 --> 20:47.038
(crickets chirping)

20:47.122 --> 20:49.124
Mmm.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.800
Good.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.962
