<i>There comes a time in every
man's life when he asks himself...</i>

00:55.931 --> 00:57.808
<i>"Am I living the life I should be?"</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:01.520
<i>"Or am I capable of something greater?"</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:06.149
<i>"Is there a change that I can make
in my life right now</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:09.194
<i>to become the best version of myself?</i>

01:10.612 --> 01:12.072
<i>Who do I wanna be?"</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:13.448
What is the life that I wanna have?

01:13.448 --> 01:15.826
What is the face
that I wanna present to the world?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.622
These are the kinds of questions
that keep you up at night.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.960
And when you're behind the wheel of
a high-performance automobile like this,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.837
no one asks those questions.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.381
They know you are that guy.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.300
You have that life.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.223
Maybe
I should look for something less cool.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.394
Can I be honest?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.272
That's your ex talking.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.983
We gotta get your confidence back.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.110
If there's one thing I've learned,

01:50.110 --> 01:53.197
it is never too late to become
the man that you've always wanted to be.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.035
Dan! I don't know how you do it.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.287
Guy looks like he just
got himself a Lambo.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.247
Hey, one man's lemon
is another man's lemonade.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.248
He just needed a squeeze.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.626
Well, it's earned you
Salesman of the Month again.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.422
Nice!

02:10.422 --> 02:13.258
Hey, Deb. Can you take a photo
of Dan for the website, please?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.802
You know what? I actually--
I'm sorry, I gotta get home.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.472
- It's my anniversary.
- Oh, come on, Dan. You do this every time.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.265
Give it to Hal.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.391
What's up, losers?

02:21.391 --> 02:24.144
Hal, how many times have I told
you about driving on the lot like that?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.897
Cars are like chicks, Jorge.
They wanna go fast.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.983
Your fly's open.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.570
Dan-- Come on.
Don't make me give it to this guy.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.864
Oh, come on. I mean,
he's just got his teeth done.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.783
Go get 'em, Hal.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.352
<i>...road ...home...</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.437
Hey, Dan.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.898
Hi, Mrs. Overmeyer.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.275
Hey, Daniel.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.735
<i>...Buffalo</i>

03:15.696 --> 03:17.072
- Hey, Beau.
- Hey!

03:34.047 --> 03:37.092
I told you already, Nina.
Stanford is restrictive early action.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.219
If you apply to Iowa now,
you could mess it all up.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.679
I know what I'm doing.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.140
Do you? It certainly
doesn't look like it from here.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.476
- Happy anniversary!
- Aw, baby.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.520
- You remembered.
- Hey. You thought I forgot.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.566
Can you please tell Nina that we're not
paying for her to follow Trevor to Iowa?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.942
Don't say his name like that.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.945
- Like what?
- Come on.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.364
Max! Crushing the peas.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.492
That's a good boy.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.077
Hey, buddy.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.162
How was your day?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.874
You got any plans this weekend?

04:08.874 --> 04:11.335
Come on.
We'll go in the yard, throw a few pitches,

04:11.335 --> 04:13.003
see if you got
any gas left in this cannon.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.671
Come on, bud.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.964
Where you going?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.423
- Samir's.
- Again?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.426
You made me quit gaming
so I'd make friends.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.262
I made you quit gaming
because blowing people's heads off 24-7

04:22.262 --> 04:23.347
isn't exactly healthy.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.849
You know, you're meant to be
babysitting tonight. It's our anniversary.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.434
What? Why can't she?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.021
- What, because I'm a woman?
- That is not what I'm saying.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.648
- That's what you're saying to me.
- It's not.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.358
- What is wrong with you?
- Are you kidding?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.609
- Is this Trevor? Who's talking now?
- Really?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.361
Do you have a life
other than just freaking pissing me off?

04:37.361 --> 04:38.487
- Is it Nina or Trevor?
- I'm serious--

04:38.487 --> 04:41.198
All right. Come on. Stop it, okay? Please.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.700
Look, Nina.
Can you cover for your brother tonight?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.494
It might be good for him
to finally get out of the house,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.287
and you can work on your application.

04:49.873 --> 04:50.874
Fine.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.377
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.172
Look, can you just--

04:57.172 --> 04:59.633
Can you talk to Mom
and ask her to, like, lay off of me?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.759
Because I'm a grown woman.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.844
I heard that, Nina.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.804
I'll talk to her. But seriously, Beans--

05:03.804 --> 05:04.888
- No, don't call me that.
- No.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.181
What happened to journalism at Stanford?

05:06.181 --> 05:08.183
- Wasn't that the dream?
- Journalism is dead, Dad.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.268
Yeah, right.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.353
- Is that something that Trevor said, or--
- Yeah, really.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.771
- He shouldn't say that.
- Really? Yes.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.147
He shouldn't be putting ideas
in your head.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.524
- I'm brainwashed.
- My God. Honey,

05:15.524 --> 05:17.609
I am so glad it's not just me.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.777
Oh, my gosh.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.237
- All right, Maxie.
- Okay.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.947
I'm gonna put him to bed.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.073
And then?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.117
- Are we still doing this?
- Oh, we're doing it.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.201
Awesome.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.312
Hey, Samir.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.571
Sup, y'all?

06:02.571 --> 06:03.780
Kyllboi's back, baby.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.201
All right. Here we go.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.288
Come on. Let me show you how it's done.
Watch this.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.709
Give me the last one, guys.
Come on. Come on.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.670
Boom!

06:19.379 --> 06:20.380
Yes!

06:20.380 --> 06:24.426
- Oh, man. Kyllboi's awesome.
- Kyllboi's sick.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.763
We're actually gonna go as a group,
so you can go ahead.

06:27.763 --> 06:28.847
Oh, yeah.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.600
- Eighteen years. Can you believe it?
- It's nuts we keep coming back here

06:31.600 --> 06:33.352
every year for Twisted Cyclone.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.938
What? No. I meant 18 years married.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.648
And I thought you loved this tradition.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.233
- I do!
- Are you sure?

06:39.233 --> 06:40.567
I did.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.528
I just-- I don't know,
you're such a creature of habit.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.779
I love that about you.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.864
You know, we make tacos on Wednesdays--

06:45.864 --> 06:48.992
- Well, Tuesday, everybody's doing it.
- And we have sex on Thursdays.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.327
If we can get the kids out of the house.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.703
- I know.
- We gotta get them out more...

06:51.703 --> 06:53.205
- I know. No one makes a better...
- ...if we want more time.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.832
...weekly planner than you do,
but I don't know.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.961
Maybe I just wanna be
a little bit more spontaneous and travel,

06:58.961 --> 07:01.338
or-- I kind of feel like
we don't really go anywhere.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.632
Well, I mean-- Well, we got the kids,
and they got school,

07:03.632 --> 07:05.050
they got routines and friends--

07:05.050 --> 07:06.593
- What friends?
- And just all that type of stuff.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.388
Kyle has one friend which,
by the way, he never even invites over.

07:09.388 --> 07:10.848
Yeah, but he's a human with a pulse.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.057
- I'll take it.
- God.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.559
- Nina's the one I'm worried about.
- I know.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.060
She's so anti-establishment.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.229
- She's anti the system. She's anti--
- Anti me.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.065
Oh, come on. You know it's true.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.945
- I'm sorry.
- No.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.029
Now's not the time.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.114
You're right.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.158
Now is the time to nut up and get ready
for the near-death adrenaline rush

07:30.158 --> 07:33.495
of Buffalo's 1998 winner
of the fourth-finest roller coaster.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.414
- I know. It's good.
- Do you think you can handle it?

07:35.414 --> 07:37.541
Do you think I can still handle it?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.502
Baby!

07:40.502 --> 07:42.671
- You're so crazy!
- You know I love you!

07:42.671 --> 07:45.132
- I love you!
- Yeah!

07:53.515 --> 07:55.851
I promise,
next year, we'll go somewhere else.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.271
- No. We'll always have Twisted Cyclone.
- No, look. I don't need to come back here

07:59.271 --> 08:01.815
to remember that this is where
I fell in love with you

08:01.815 --> 08:03.275
on our very first date,

08:03.275 --> 08:05.235
holding your hair back while you barfed.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.863
I still can't believe
you wanted to kiss me.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.281
I'll always wanna kiss you.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.366
Yeah.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.041
Hey.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.251
That picture you just took,
it was kind of a private moment.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.462
- You mind deleting it?
- Yeah, I do.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.880
Hey, come on, man. Don't.

08:27.591 --> 08:28.800
Don't do that.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.261
Hey, come on. Take it down.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.515
Take it down.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.642
Make me.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.352
Hey, Dan. Leave it. Let's--

08:38.352 --> 08:40.354
Yeah. Listen to your lady, Dan.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.234
Is there a tough guy in there, Dan?

08:45.943 --> 08:47.069
Are you a tough guy?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.335
Hey, tell me.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.296
How'd a loser like him
get a girl as fine as you...

09:06.922 --> 09:07.923
probably were?

09:13.262 --> 09:14.805
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye, Dan.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.313
I didn't want you to fight him.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.442
If I wanted to marry a brawler,
I would've.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.903
I know you don't like violence.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.364
It's not like I care what he said.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.597
What are you doing up?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.642
You want me to do the thing, huh?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.146
Wait. Go.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.275
Wipey, wipey.

10:13.906 --> 10:14.907
New record!

10:32.299 --> 10:33.967
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.177
Anniversary sex.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.054
I'm awake.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.805
I'm totally awake.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.058
I'm so sorry tonight was a bust.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.644
- I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise.
- Oh, it's okay.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.145
It's okay.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.189
You know what?

10:47.731 --> 10:50.067
I should have kicked that guy's ass
for what he said to you.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.402
Oh, God.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.571
You totally could've taken him, honey.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.577
Oh, babe.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.329
Sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.418
Can we do this on Thursday?

11:09.711 --> 11:11.338
I'm so tired.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.673
Yeah, sure.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.843
I love you.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.427
I love you too.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.103
Remember to block your faces.
You don't wanna lose them.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.277
Husband or boyfriend?

11:33.277 --> 11:35.237
Teenage daughter.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.780
I'm sorry.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.365
Okay, guys. Partner up.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.786
- You?
- Okay.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.871
Cool.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.582
All right.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.209
I'm so bad at this. I usually take barre,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.711
but I couldn't find one in Buffalo.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.088
No, you're doing great.
Just keep your fists up.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.966
- Where's home?
- Nowhere, everywhere.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.261
- I'm in the travel business.
- Sounds so nice.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.263
Are you here for work?

12:01.263 --> 12:03.015
No, I'm here to see my ex.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.474
Now swap.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.934
Sorry, TMI.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.313
Don't worry about it. Just take it out
on the bag. That's what I do.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.025
- How old is your daughter?
- Seventeen.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.195
Oh, my God.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.198
I am so sorry

12:19.198 --> 12:21.617
about that again. How's it feeling?

12:22.284 --> 12:23.243
It's--

12:23.785 --> 12:25.537
No, it's fine. It's a story.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.915
I got beat up
by a physical therapist at the gym.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.041
God.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.751
You have a mean right hook, by the way.

12:30.751 --> 12:31.960
Thanks.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.170
Gosh.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.380
Okay. So, where were we?

12:35.380 --> 12:36.757
Three kids...

12:37.257 --> 12:38.759
Three kids. Yeah.

12:38.759 --> 12:44.431
Yeah. Just when I thought I was sending
one off to college, along came Max.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.934
Adorable...

12:49.394 --> 12:50.479
What?

12:51.563 --> 12:55.108
I don't know. Sometimes I guess
I just feel like I'm a little...

12:56.026 --> 12:57.361
I don't know, trapped?

12:57.361 --> 12:59.154
I know that sounds so awful.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.866
It's just that, Dan, my husband,

13:03.408 --> 13:06.787
I mean, he's an amazing dad, you know?

13:06.787 --> 13:10.123
I guess he's just so content being here.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.001
In Buffalo?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.962
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.505
- I didn't mean to...
- No.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.340
- ...say it like that.
- That's true.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.426
I mean, when we met, I wanted to travel.
I wanted to see the world.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.138
But Dan's--
He's just a total homebody, you know?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.725
He's so focused on the family, and I do,
I love that about him. He's amazing.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.269
I just wish our lives were...

13:31.728 --> 13:33.313
bigger, you know? Just...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.317
I get it.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.653
I'm sorry. Talk about TMI.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.031
No, I've got to catch a flight, as always.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.535
But, listen. If you ever do
convince your husband to travel,

13:46.535 --> 13:49.079
I promise you, I'm better at my job
than I am at kickboxing.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.707
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.630
<i>Great news.</i>

13:58.630 --> 14:01.175
- <i>Today is Half-Price Wednesday...</i>
- You're about to go to size 4S,huh?

14:01.175 --> 14:03.302
Are you so big now, huh? How big is Maxie?

14:05.888 --> 14:06.889
So big.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.348
Look at the big muscles.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.061
Okay, hold on.

14:13.061 --> 14:17.024
We're gonna get this for Mama.
And that. And that.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.276
You wanna get ice cream?

14:19.818 --> 14:21.570
Yeah, I'm gonna get you ice cream.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.283
Yeah?

14:29.328 --> 14:30.954
Yeah. There it is.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.039
You want this one?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.624
I'll get you french fries.

14:42.007 --> 14:42.966
Oh, shit.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.429
I'm so sorry about this, pal.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.641
Really?

14:55.521 --> 14:56.647
Hey, asshole.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.524
At least let me put my kid down.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.370
Oh, shit.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.209
- Daniel.
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Overmeyer.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.335
Uh-oh.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.296
Oh, my God!

15:21.296 --> 15:22.297
Hey!

15:37.062 --> 15:38.939
I told you to let me put my kid down!

15:49.867 --> 15:51.159
I got 'em.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.620
<i>Cleaning team to aisle three, please.</i>

15:56.498 --> 15:57.499
Sorry about the mess.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.918
Thank you for shopping
at Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.805
Hold on.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.895
Hey, Beau.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.565
- Hey, Dan.
- Have a good one.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.483
All right.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.795
Shit. The passports are out of date.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.681
From here on in,
Daddy's paying in cash, Maxie.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.809
<i>Hello?</i>

16:57.809 --> 16:59.686
Hey, don't hang up.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.772
How are you still alive?

17:01.772 --> 17:03.482
Yeah, it's nice to hear your voice too.

17:03.982 --> 17:07.069
Look, I need new identities.
I'm burned. Full packets.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.780
Me, my wife, and three kids.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.906
Three? How did that happen?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.076
Do I really need to explain the birds
and the bees right now, Augie,

17:14.076 --> 17:15.327
or can we talk business?

17:16.453 --> 17:17.746
Oh, God.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.498
You've got some nerve calling me.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.667
McCaffrey scorched the earth
looking for you.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.419
Yep. Looks like he's found me.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.671
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.047
Social media, I guess.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.214
<i>You idiot.</i>

17:29.550 --> 17:31.468
I had to leave my life behind.

17:31.468 --> 17:36.014
Now I'm stuck in Tempe, Arizona, making
fake IDs for entitled college pricks.

17:37.015 --> 17:40.227
- Should I go?
- Oh, no. You can stay.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.105
But given you're trying to look
like you're not in college,

17:43.105 --> 17:44.398
maybe try losing the hoodie?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.776
Look, I'll pay you
a half a million in cash.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.571
<i>And you get Doris a condo
in one of those retirement places.</i>

17:51.238 --> 17:53.740
You know, the ones with the golf carts,
the wine and cheese happy hour,

17:53.740 --> 17:54.950
mah-jongg at six o'clock?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.410
Leave my mom out of this.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.704
- <i>She'll love it.</i>
- I can sell you out for twice that.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.372
Well, you haven't in 18 years.

18:00.873 --> 18:02.875
Meet me in Vegas in three days.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.796
I'll give you a time and a place
once I'm on the road.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.464
Vegas? Why Vegas?

18:09.464 --> 18:12.426
I can't tell my wife I'm taking her
on vacation to Tempe, Arizona.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.343
Vegas, I can sell.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.596
You haven't told them? Are you mental?

18:15.596 --> 18:17.806
What, do you think it's that easy?
What am I meant to do?

18:17.806 --> 18:19.933
Sit them down and tell them
the whole story over French toast?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.519
<i>Oh, hey, kids. You know what?
Pass the maple syrup. By the way,</i>

18:22.519 --> 18:24.563
your dad was a government assassin.

18:24.563 --> 18:27.065
I'll tell them when I'm on the road
and safe. Three days, Augie.

18:32.863 --> 18:33.989
Chess club.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.580
All right, come on.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.717
Where's Nina?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.887
Nina's not the editor anymore. She quit.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.305
What? When?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.057
Three months ago.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.600
So, where is she now?

19:02.518 --> 19:03.727
I don't know.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.895
All right, look.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.022
I'll give you 50 bucks
for your best guess of where Nina is.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.566
I'm a journalist. I don't give people up.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.901
100.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.277
Try under the bleachers.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.737
That's what I thought.

19:20.452 --> 19:24.164
I wrote my college essay on how
universities propagate systemic racism,

19:24.164 --> 19:25.374
and my mom shot it down.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.542
I was like, "Hello,

19:26.542 --> 19:27.751
that's how change happens."

19:27.751 --> 19:29.795
And she goes, "No, that's how
community college happens."

19:30.379 --> 19:31.463
Nina.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.799
Dad, what are you doing here?

19:33.799 --> 19:35.968
This is a safe space.
He can't just come in here.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.052
Your dad's hot.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.763
Okay, Kelly. That's gross.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.265
You're meant to be
in an editorial meeting.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.267
Yeah, I am. I was.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.227
- I--
- You quit three months ago.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.479
How could you do that?
You worked so hard to become editor.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.731
- You don't even read my stuff.
- Of course I do.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.149
- I always do.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.235
You know what? I don't have time for this.
Where's the chess club?

19:53.235 --> 19:55.320
- We need to find your brother.
- Can't you tell me what's going on?

19:55.320 --> 19:57.322
Nothing. I have a surprise
for the family, okay?

19:57.322 --> 19:59.950
- What's the surprise?
- Where is the chess club?

19:59.950 --> 20:02.327
It's in the math building.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.620
Thank you, Kelly.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.040
- Dad, wait.
- What now?

20:08.125 --> 20:09.334
He's not there.

20:17.426 --> 20:18.594
Stay in the car.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.596
Oh, no. Forget it. I am not missing this.

20:20.596 --> 20:22.514
- Missing what?
- Nothing.

20:23.724 --> 20:24.933
Go, go, go, go, go.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.105
- Shit.
- Are you Samir?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.940
- Yeah.
- I'm Kyle's dad. Is he here?

20:38.822 --> 20:40.240
What happened to chess club?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.034
It was canceled today.

20:42.034 --> 20:44.578
- Right, Samir?
- You don't pay me to lie.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.955
- You pay him?
- No, I--

20:49.208 --> 20:50.584
You don't need to-- It's--

20:55.088 --> 20:56.256
- I can explain.
- Get in the car.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.550
- I--
- Get in the car.

20:59.134 --> 20:59.968
Let's go now.

21:02.888 --> 21:03.764
Traitor.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.193
- So, what's the big surprise?
- We're going on a trip.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.070
I actually have plans this weekend, so I--

21:18.070 --> 21:19.363
You're very grounded, both of you.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.041
<i>Look, we're going up there
to get your mom.</i>

21:31.041 --> 21:33.335
You two are gonna show her
nothing but excitement for this trip,

21:33.335 --> 21:35.087
or I'm gonna tell her
that you've been lying to us,

21:35.087 --> 21:36.713
and you know how that's gonna go down.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.632
Where are we even going?

21:38.632 --> 21:39.716
<i>Vegas?</i>

21:40.300 --> 21:42.761
- We're going to Las Vegas today?
- Well, you said you wanted...

21:42.761 --> 21:44.096
- Now?
- ...to be more spontaneous.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.098
I heard you. And Jorge said
I could take a few days off.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.891
Is Jorge the one that does...

21:47.891 --> 21:50.936
- ...hydromassages on Tuesdays?
- No, Mrs. Kessler. Jorge is Dan's boss.

21:50.936 --> 21:54.815
- Is Dan giving me a hydromassage?
- No, Mrs. Kessler.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.066
There's no massages today.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.193
No. The kids have a long weekend,
and they're pumped. Right, guys?

21:58.193 --> 22:00.654
Guys, tell your mom
how pumped you are for this trip.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.532
- Yes!
- So pumped.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.451
Dan, we can't just up and go to Vegas.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.328
I mean-- And why Vegas?

22:08.328 --> 22:12.249
I know it's not Europe,
but there's a Venice and an Eiffel Tower.

22:12.249 --> 22:14.835
You know what? I bet you
we can get last-minute Adele tickets.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.545
- You love Adele.
- You love Adele.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.297
Of course I love Adele.
Who doesn't love Adele?

22:18.297 --> 22:20.174
- I love Adele.
- Everybody loves Adele.

22:20.174 --> 22:22.009
She's got the voice of a freaking angel.

22:22.009 --> 22:24.469
Come on, Jess. What is holding us back?

22:24.469 --> 22:27.639
Who are you? I mean,
I don't even recognize you.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.808
Well, you're gonna love him.
He's crazy in bed.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.811
Are you sure it's not Tuesday?

22:32.811 --> 22:35.814
You deserve a break. And I think this
could be really good for us as a family.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.566
And we're driving there?

22:37.566 --> 22:39.526
Well, nothing brings
a family together like a road trip.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.447
But we gotta go now.
Before the traffic gets bad.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.074
And Mrs. Kessler, I'm so sorry.
You keep working on those deltoids, okay?

22:46.074 --> 22:48.035
- Thanks, Jorge.
- What about our stuff?

22:48.035 --> 22:50.412
- I mean, I need to pack, the baby. It's--
- Oh, no.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.539
I got all the basics packed already.
Yeah. When we get there,

22:52.539 --> 22:55.125
we're gonna use the money that we
saved on flights to go all <i>Pretty Woman</i>

22:55.125 --> 22:56.543
in those fancy hotel boutiques...

22:56.543 --> 22:58.337
- ...that smell like leather and patchouli.
- Stop.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.672
And guess who's got no budget?
You get whatever you want.

23:02.257 --> 23:05.010
Okay. This is totally crazy.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.595
- Dan, this is crazy.
- I know. It's crazy.

23:06.595 --> 23:07.888
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna get crazy.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.431
We're going to Vegas!

23:10.599 --> 23:11.808
Do we have snacks?

23:11.808 --> 23:13.185
Let's just get out there on the road,

23:13.185 --> 23:14.853
and then we can make a stop and--

23:19.816 --> 23:22.903
I think I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Save us a little bit of time.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.321
What?

23:29.451 --> 23:30.494
Go, go, go!

23:31.495 --> 23:33.830
- Shit.
- It's a shortcut. You never take Elmwood?

23:33.830 --> 23:34.748
Shit.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.675
All right. We're off.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.100
Hey, Maxie.

23:53.684 --> 23:54.935
- First road trip.
- Yeah.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.855
Max, you excited?

23:57.855 --> 24:01.024
Five hours on a plane,
or 33 hours in a car?

24:01.024 --> 24:02.192
I choose 33 hours.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.236
Da!

24:12.035 --> 24:13.829
Honey, you remembered my boots!

24:13.829 --> 24:15.706
- Yeah.
- Baby!

24:15.706 --> 24:16.874
I can't believe that.

24:23.213 --> 24:25.591
- Oh, my God. Jesus. Dad.
- Jesus.

24:25.591 --> 24:27.384
- Easy there, lead-foot.
- Sorry about that.

24:27.384 --> 24:29.094
Think a squirrel or something
jumped out in front of me.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.182
Oh, my God.

24:33.182 --> 24:36.101
- Where on earth are you taking us?
- What? Oh, no. This is a shortcut, honey.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.394
You never take it?

24:39.146 --> 24:39.980
Shit.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.735
He's tracking us.

24:45.319 --> 24:46.403
Oh, nothing.

24:46.403 --> 24:47.529
Nothing, honey.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.334
You know what? Actually, I gotta stop
and check something at work real quick.

25:10.177 --> 25:13.180
- Is that Hal?
- Yeah. He's got a new mustache.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.015
- You work with that guy?
- It will just be a second.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.231
I think there's a service area
to the right.

25:32.241 --> 25:35.786
All right. If you guys just give me
a second, I'll be right there.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.585
- Dad, what the hell?
- Language, Nina.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.046
Dan, what the hell?

25:46.046 --> 25:47.631
Oh, well, we're driving 2,000 miles.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.550
We've gotta change the oil,
check the coolant,

25:50.801 --> 25:52.052
pop a little extra air in the tires.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.847
I'd hate to be halfway across the desert
and wish we'd checked that coolant, right?

25:54.847 --> 25:56.974
Can we not be in the car for it?

26:01.520 --> 26:03.480
Okay, he's stopped.
He's right ahead of us.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.503
He should be here.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.139
Hey, guys.
Just hang in there for a minute.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.223
Dan?

26:39.183 --> 26:40.767
Mom, when we're in Vegas,

26:40.767 --> 26:43.437
- can I go to HyperX?
- No, you're not going to a strip club.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.022
- It's not a strip club.
- Why are you laughing?

26:45.022 --> 26:46.231
You're not gambling, Nina.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.774
- Do you have a fake ID?
- I'm not being-- No.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.109
Dan!

26:49.109 --> 26:51.737
Hey, Hal. Nice wheels.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.071
- She just come in?
- Yeah.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.823
I was thinking about
opening her up a little bit.

26:54.823 --> 26:58.118
Oh, man. I tell you what.
She wants to go fast.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.286
Cars are like chicks, man.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.622
- Yes! Right.
- Get her on the freeway.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.749
You open her up.
And you get a ticket, it's on me.

27:09.338 --> 27:11.632
I got him. He's on the move.
He's heading west.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.638
Hey, guys.

27:17.638 --> 27:18.805
- Yes?
- We're ready.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.058
Are we going to Vegas,
or are we just gonna live up here?

27:21.058 --> 27:22.601
We're on our way, honey.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.715
- Honey, aren't your feet cold?
- I don't care. I am on vacation.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.801
What are you doing?

27:55.801 --> 27:57.344
I'm posting about our trip.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.556
Look, do we really need to be posting
and tweeting and TikToking?

28:00.556 --> 28:01.932
In my day,
road trips were all about interaction.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.017
No, Dad. Please. I can't deal
with a dad lecture right now.

28:04.017 --> 28:06.603
You literally don't even know how to text,
so your opinion doesn't count.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.605
I'm serious. This should be
a device-free vacation, okay?

28:08.605 --> 28:09.690
Give them up, now.

28:09.690 --> 28:10.941
- What?
- Seriously.

28:10.941 --> 28:12.401
- What?
- Give it up. Now.

28:12.401 --> 28:15.904
- Jess, a little help?
- Okay, you heard him. Hand 'em over.

28:17.573 --> 28:18.574
Yours too.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.494
All right. Mine too. All of us, okay?
Solidarity! Bye!

28:22.494 --> 28:27.040
No!

28:31.461 --> 28:33.422
No, no, no. Dad.

28:33.422 --> 28:35.299
- No way you just did that. What?
- Oh, my God, Dad.

28:35.299 --> 28:37.634
I've just freed our family
from the shackles of technology

28:37.634 --> 28:39.428
- with a flick of my wrist. Just like that.
- Stop the car.

28:39.428 --> 28:42.514
And trust me, it's gonna bring us all
closer together. Just you wait.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.974
You've lost your mind.

28:43.974 --> 28:46.226
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever. I'll just buy myself a new one.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.228
What, like you buy your friends?

28:48.228 --> 28:50.230
- Look, Samir is a business associate.
- Oh, yeah.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.316
- Look. At least they're talking.
- Do you wanna tell Mom and Dad

28:52.316 --> 28:53.901
- about all your business endeavors?
- I don't give a--

28:53.901 --> 28:55.527
I've got a question for you,
Mr. Spontaneous.

28:55.527 --> 28:58.280
Without our phones, how are we
gonna know where we're going?

28:58.947 --> 29:00.699
If this is a joke, it's not funny.

29:00.699 --> 29:03.410
It's not a joke. We're going
on a family road trip. We need maps.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.287
Dude, why don't you just, like, you know--

29:07.122 --> 29:09.416
Yeah, Dad. Why?

29:09.416 --> 29:11.752
Because he was trying
to promote familial bonding

29:11.752 --> 29:13.795
through the forcible
removal of technology.

29:14.630 --> 29:16.924
Look, I need travel help.
Isn't this what you do?

29:17.674 --> 29:19.301
Not for a long time.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.597
What's your destination?

29:23.597 --> 29:24.765
Las Vegas.

29:24.765 --> 29:26.475
I'm also going to need help
with some reservations,

29:26.475 --> 29:28.685
if that's not too much
of an inconvenience for you.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.689
Okay. Here you go.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.275
All right.

29:38.278 --> 29:42.824
- I'm gonna need a credit card.
- You know what? Here's my membership card.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.285
I think you'll see
I've got a few rewards points there.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.662
That's not really how it works.

29:46.662 --> 29:48.205
- It's like a whole thing.
- I get it.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.832
Maybe with all those points,
I don't even need a credit card.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.878
What do you think, Levon? Are we good?

29:54.878 --> 29:56.213
How many points do we have?

29:56.213 --> 29:59.466
Looks like you are platinum elite
superior diamond members.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.802
And I would love to help you today.

30:03.345 --> 30:05.389
<i>Stop, collaborate and listen</i>

30:05.389 --> 30:07.599
<i>Ice is back with a brand-new invention</i>

30:07.599 --> 30:11.270
<i>Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly</i>

30:11.270 --> 30:12.396
<i>Will it ever stop?
Yo</i>

30:12.396 --> 30:15.858
<i>I don't know
Turn off the lights and-- and I'll glow</i>

30:15.858 --> 30:17.734
<i>To the extreme
I rock a mic like a vandal</i>

30:17.734 --> 30:20.445
- Please stop. Can someone unlock the car?
- <i>A chump like a candle</i>

30:23.907 --> 30:24.908
<i>Deadly</i>

30:26.118 --> 30:28.036
Say, "Ooh."

30:28.036 --> 30:29.121
Damn.

30:29.746 --> 30:30.873
It's pretty impressive, huh?

30:32.040 --> 30:33.041
How good is Mom?

30:33.041 --> 30:34.459
<i>...problem, yo, I'll solve it</i>

30:34.459 --> 30:36.378
<i>Check out the hook
While the DJ revolves it</i>

30:36.378 --> 30:38.213
<i>Ice, ice, baby</i>

30:38.839 --> 30:40.007
Come on, guys.

30:40.632 --> 30:43.385
- <i>Ice, ice, baby</i>
- What is "ice, ice, baby"?

31:02.654 --> 31:04.114
Call in everybody.

31:04.615 --> 31:06.742
The Swedes, Gunther, Spiros.

31:06.742 --> 31:09.703
- I want 'em found.
- Well, there's no hits on their cards.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.163
Must be using cash.

31:11.163 --> 31:13.457
I've been tracking their socials,
but nothing so far.

31:13.457 --> 31:15.042
Must have turned their phones off.

31:15.626 --> 31:18.420
Hey, his kid's a gamer called Kyllboi.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.630
He's pretty good.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.551
Get eyes on the road,
and find that minivan.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.969
You got it, boss.

31:25.969 --> 31:28.639
Be tough for him to switch cars
without tipping off the family.

31:28.639 --> 31:31.058
- What makes you think they don't know?
- They're still with him.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.695
Look at you. You're in withdrawal.

31:43.695 --> 31:46.782
Can you really not go, like, one day
without blowing people's brains out?

31:46.782 --> 31:48.116
I have a brand to manage.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.869
A desensitized cog
in the violence-obsessed

31:50.869 --> 31:52.704
capitalist machine is a brand?

31:52.704 --> 31:53.914
Oh, good. Trevor's here.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.792
Do you even remember
what your own personality is like?

31:57.376 --> 31:58.335
No.

32:00.462 --> 32:01.588
You used to be cool.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.720
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.430
Well, yeah. I've seen you on Twitch.

32:10.973 --> 32:13.892
You're the guy who took down
Synapse live on his own stream!

32:13.892 --> 32:15.310
You're Kyllboi. Right?

32:16.311 --> 32:17.813
You know about that?

32:17.813 --> 32:19.898
Yeah. Dude, that was badass.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.233
Can I get a picture?

32:22.025 --> 32:22.943
Sure.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.364
Jess, I don't know how to tell you this,

32:27.364 --> 32:30.367
but when we get to Vegas,
we're not coming home.

32:30.951 --> 32:33.453
The truth is,
I haven't been completely hon--

32:34.746 --> 32:36.832
The truth is, when we met--

32:36.832 --> 32:38.417
Before I met--

32:43.547 --> 32:45.966
All right, here we go.
We've got rooms 152 and 153.

32:46.842 --> 32:49.219
Can I get four of those
disposable cameras too, please?

32:49.219 --> 32:50.304
Yeah.

32:51.346 --> 32:52.514
Here you go.

32:52.514 --> 32:54.516
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

32:58.395 --> 33:00.397
You're awesome, dude. For real.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.815
I mean, thank you.

33:01.815 --> 33:04.318
I mean, this is literally the worst ever--

33:04.318 --> 33:05.402
I'm gonna get you.

33:05.903 --> 33:07.029
I'm gonna get you!

33:07.029 --> 33:08.864
All right. Here, kiddo.
Go make some memories.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.241
Yeah, I'm-- I don't know, this is--
It's just a weird experience for me.

33:11.241 --> 33:13.911
- That's so cool I ran into you.
- Look at your brother. He's made a friend.

33:13.911 --> 33:15.537
- Can you do the thing?
- Yeah.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.999
- Awesome. Thanks, Kyllboi.
- Thank you.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.503
- Hey, what was all this about?
- That's a really good question.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.922
- What was that about?
- Yeah, and who's Kyllboi?

33:24.922 --> 33:27.841
You know, that sounds familiar.
I feel like I know who that is.

33:27.841 --> 33:29.343
- That's--
- No one.

33:29.343 --> 33:30.802
- It's nothing.
- Oh, my God.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.095
- It's not important.
- He's Kyllboi.

33:32.095 --> 33:34.306
It's his gamer tag. He never quit gaming.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.266
He thinks he's, like,
famous or something now.

33:36.266 --> 33:37.434
Really?

33:37.434 --> 33:40.187
- Big boy!
- Da.

33:40.187 --> 33:42.105
- Da?
- Is she gonna post that picture?

33:42.731 --> 33:44.608
- Probably, yeah.
- Hey!

33:44.608 --> 33:46.109
Did you get some rooms?

33:46.902 --> 33:48.904
No. They're all booked.
We gotta keep going.

33:48.904 --> 33:50.322
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:14.888 --> 34:15.764
It's them.

34:21.603 --> 34:22.688
Let's go.

36:54.047 --> 36:56.216
- What was that?
- Hey, honey.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.093
Just a little bit of a pothole there.

37:00.554 --> 37:04.391
Max, did you see that?
That guy was flying.

37:25.287 --> 37:26.330
Oh, my God.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.123
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.002
- Where are we?
- Iowa.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.587
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

37:33.587 --> 37:34.963
Wait. Did you drive all night?

37:34.963 --> 37:36.548
Well, what can I say?

37:36.548 --> 37:39.301
I was so damn excited I couldn't sleep.

37:39.301 --> 37:41.220
I mean, I kept getting second winds.
More like fifth winds.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.597
- And then, before you know it, bam.
- God.

37:43.597 --> 37:44.806
We're in Iowa City.

37:44.806 --> 37:46.391
That's not a real cow, honey.

37:46.391 --> 37:47.809
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

37:48.685 --> 37:50.479
Oh, my God.
Did you just say we're in Iowa City?

37:50.479 --> 37:51.605
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, honey.

37:51.605 --> 37:54.024
That means we're literally,
like, half an inch from SIU.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.359
We can stop and--

37:55.359 --> 37:57.361
We are not gonna
stop and see Trevor, okay?

37:57.945 --> 38:01.198
Actually, I meant that I wanted to see
campus, but whatever.

38:01.198 --> 38:03.617
Right. 'Cause you're really
interested in seeing the facilities.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.202
- Yeah. Actually, I am.
- Are you serious?

38:05.202 --> 38:07.663
Are we gonna argue about this?
About you following a boy to college?

38:07.663 --> 38:09.248
- I'm not following a boy to col--
- Guys.

38:09.248 --> 38:10.791
You're gonna go for three months--

38:10.791 --> 38:12.793
- Guys.
- It's the college that I want to go to.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.253
Obviously,
I would want to go see the campus.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.880
- Why do you wanna go?
- We're so far from home.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.465
This place is gorgeous.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.259
How could you not want me to come here?

38:22.427 --> 38:25.389
I cannot believe
that you are encouraging this.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.474
Look, it wouldn't hurt for us
to be off the road for a bit.

38:27.474 --> 38:30.143
Besides, I mean,
maybe if we want her to listen to us,

38:30.143 --> 38:31.895
we gotta start listening to her more.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.565
Let her look around. It's safe, nice.

38:34.565 --> 38:38.360
And besides,
it'll give us a chance to talk.

38:46.702 --> 38:49.830
Okay. You wanna find out
what college life is really about?

38:51.123 --> 38:52.165
Follow me.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.096
This takes me back.

39:06.096 --> 39:10.475
- It's like a toxic masculinity convention.
- It's called school spirit, Nina.

39:10.475 --> 39:13.270
Yeah, okay. You're not the one who's
gonna get flipped over in a porta-potty.

39:15.022 --> 39:16.565
Well, it's pretty festive. Do you like it?

39:16.565 --> 39:19.193
- Yeah. It's cool.
- Yes.

39:21.236 --> 39:23.488
Hey, sexy. You want me to show you
how to do a keg stand?

39:28.869 --> 39:30.329
Sorry. I didn't realize you were...

39:31.705 --> 39:32.873
a mom.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.251
Nina.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.462
Do you mind?

39:38.462 --> 39:40.088
Okay. Here you go.

39:41.882 --> 39:43.008
Yep.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.176
Oh, my God.

39:44.176 --> 39:46.553
- Yo! Come through. She's gonna do it.
- Mom!

39:48.055 --> 39:49.056
Mom!

39:49.640 --> 39:50.682
I can't--

40:02.444 --> 40:04.863
- Beer me!
- Come on! Yeah!

40:04.863 --> 40:08.367
Chug! Chug! Chug!

40:08.367 --> 40:11.703
Chug! Chug! Chug!

40:11.703 --> 40:12.955
Chug! Chug!

40:24.800 --> 40:27.719
- Don't you ever try anything like that.
- Mom, that was--

40:27.719 --> 40:29.888
that was awesome, actually. I--

40:29.888 --> 40:30.973
"Beer me"?

40:33.267 --> 40:35.561
Let's get out of here
before I get too competitive

40:35.561 --> 40:37.771
- and start kicking ass at beer pong.
- Oh, my God.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.273
I wonder what that looks like.

40:40.190 --> 40:42.192
I hope you all enjoyed seeing the library.

40:42.192 --> 40:43.861
First time for me too.

40:43.861 --> 40:45.946
- Hey, guys. Look. There's a tour.
- And you know...

40:45.946 --> 40:48.615
Let's slip in the back and pretend like
we were a part of the group all along.

40:48.615 --> 40:49.908
- Do we have to?
- Yeah.

40:49.908 --> 40:51.201
We're here to support your sister.

40:51.201 --> 40:53.078
If you're questioning that,
you get to strap on Max.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.746
- Let's go.
- Next up,

40:54.746 --> 40:58.083
we'll head on over to visit
our state-of-the-art athletic facilities.

40:59.877 --> 41:01.420
I'm sorry that I ratted you out.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.173
It's just, it drives me crazy
that you get away with so much,

41:04.173 --> 41:07.509
and I get yelled at constantly just
because you guys don't get Trevor.

41:07.509 --> 41:08.886
We get Trevor.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.512
- We don't like Trevor.
- Why?

41:11.430 --> 41:14.308
Ever since you've been dating him, you've
been like a completely different person.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.311
I liked you better before.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.189
Plus, he treats you like shit.
You deserve more.

41:23.192 --> 41:27.070
Is that, like,
genuine concern for my feelings?

41:27.070 --> 41:28.864
No. God, no. Gross.

41:30.824 --> 41:33.869
I wonder what's going on in your mind.

41:33.869 --> 41:35.621
It's just-- I don't know.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.873
Another blast from the past.

41:38.457 --> 41:39.958
You think you can still do it?

41:40.459 --> 41:44.046
No. Not unless I wanted to
end up in the hospital.

41:44.755 --> 41:48.300
It's just-- It's funny
to think how different my life would be

41:48.300 --> 41:50.427
if I hadn't torn my ACL.

41:50.427 --> 41:53.180
- Well, do you want it to be different?
- No. God, no.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.807
It's just-- You know, it's just strange.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.768
You've never even met that version of me.

41:57.768 --> 42:00.437
You just know Jessica,
the physical therapist.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.022
Well, I love every version of you.

42:02.022 --> 42:04.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Especially that keg stand one.

42:04.358 --> 42:05.734
It was so freaking hot.

42:05.734 --> 42:07.611
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.

42:08.529 --> 42:10.572
Did you ever have sex
on the pole-vault mat?

42:13.742 --> 42:15.911
- Don't answer that. Oh, my.
- God.

42:16.703 --> 42:19.790
You have been acting so weird
this whole trip.

42:19.790 --> 42:22.626
But I gotta tell you,
I'm kind of into spontaneous Dan.

42:22.626 --> 42:26.046
Well, you know, Jess. I mean, we all have
different versions of ourselves.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.589
- And sometimes, you just--
- Yeah.

42:28.173 --> 42:29.967
That guy with the gold chain.

42:29.967 --> 42:31.760
He wasn't with the group before.

42:32.511 --> 42:33.846
- Okay.
- What's he doing?

42:38.350 --> 42:40.519
Well, they grow up fast, huh?
Which one is yours?

42:41.270 --> 42:43.397
My daughter is back in Stuttgart.

42:44.147 --> 42:46.441
- I look at school for her.
- Wow. That's a hike.

42:47.025 --> 42:48.443
I have business here.

42:48.443 --> 42:51.363
Chemistry, astronomy, astrophysics...

42:51.363 --> 42:53.282
Hey, you mentioned
having business in Iowa.

42:53.782 --> 42:55.075
What business would that be?

42:55.576 --> 42:57.536
- Corn.
- Yeah?

42:57.536 --> 42:58.829
That's what's in the case?

42:58.829 --> 42:59.913
Of course.

43:01.832 --> 43:03.625
- Ladies.
- Thanks.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.878
- After you.
- No, I insist.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.298
- Dan?
- Hey, honey.

43:09.298 --> 43:10.257
- Coming?
- Yeah.

43:10.257 --> 43:12.718
I'm just getting to know this fella here.
All the way from Stuttgart, Germany.

43:13.302 --> 43:15.554
You know, I had a pen pal
from Stuttgart back in high school.

43:15.554 --> 43:17.347
I even learned a little German.

43:17.347 --> 43:19.600
Nobody needs to know.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.352
If you want to speak about
what's in the case,

43:22.352 --> 43:24.146
it will stay between us.

43:26.106 --> 43:27.399
What did you just say?

43:27.399 --> 43:28.567
"Where's the discotheque?"

43:28.567 --> 43:30.944
Right. Okay.

43:30.944 --> 43:32.613
Don't worry, honey. We'll catch up, okay?

43:32.613 --> 43:34.656
- All right, honey.
- Goodbye, my love.

43:37.951 --> 43:39.453
Fine. You wanna dance.

43:39.453 --> 43:41.038
Let's see what's in the case.

43:45.584 --> 43:47.669
- What the hell is that?
- Heirloom corn.

43:47.669 --> 43:49.171
I thought I made this clear.

43:49.796 --> 43:51.840
So, you're just German?

43:51.840 --> 43:53.300
Yes, exactly.

43:54.176 --> 43:55.552
Oh, shit.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.912
- Biology labs are over there.
- Where's Dad?

44:21.912 --> 44:24.623
- Physics labs are down there.
- He's talking to some German guy.

44:26.208 --> 44:28.126
We have our chemistry labs right here.

44:33.757 --> 44:36.385
Never a dull moment in the labs.
Moving on.

44:36.385 --> 44:37.469
Let me show you

44:37.469 --> 44:40.013
the biggest Van de Graaff generator
in the Midwest.

45:43.702 --> 45:46.872
So, I hope you've all enjoyed
this tour of our wonderful campus.

45:46.872 --> 45:48.707
I know I have.

45:48.707 --> 45:50.667
- Hey. It's getting late.
- Hey.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.461
- We should probably get back on the road.
- Yeah.

45:52.461 --> 45:55.797
- Where's Nina?
- I said she could go say hi to Trevor.

45:55.797 --> 45:57.424
It felt cruel to deny her.

45:58.717 --> 46:00.385
It's okay. She'll be back soon.

46:00.385 --> 46:02.721
Yeah. No. I'm not worried at all.

46:10.687 --> 46:11.772
Okay.

46:13.315 --> 46:14.566
Go away, Josh.

46:15.442 --> 46:16.777
It's me.

46:16.777 --> 46:18.237
Me who?

46:19.238 --> 46:20.322
Nina.

46:23.033 --> 46:25.285
Hey. What are you doing here?

46:25.285 --> 46:26.870
It's, like, a really long story.

46:26.870 --> 46:28.413
But, can I come in?

46:28.413 --> 46:30.040
You know what?

46:30.040 --> 46:32.501
Give me just one sec,
and I'll throw on some pants,

46:32.501 --> 46:34.169
and me and you can grab a matcha.

46:36.797 --> 46:38.006
Oh, my God.

46:38.006 --> 46:39.466
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on a second.

46:39.466 --> 46:43.220
Oh, my God. You're cheating on me.

46:43.220 --> 46:47.599
Monogamy is just a construct
of our Western repressive civilization.

46:47.599 --> 46:48.684
Oh, my God.

46:48.684 --> 46:51.937
I thought
we were on the same page on that.

46:51.937 --> 46:53.021
All right.

46:53.814 --> 46:54.898
Honey, what happened?

46:54.898 --> 46:56.817
He's an asshole. That's what happened.

46:57.317 --> 46:59.820
"Monogamy is just a construct"--
Who even says that?

46:59.820 --> 47:01.321
- Trevor.
- Oh, baby. I'm so sorry.

47:01.321 --> 47:02.739
Can we just go?

47:02.739 --> 47:04.449
That's a great idea, honey. Let's go.

47:09.204 --> 47:10.205
Hey, Beans.

47:11.498 --> 47:14.084
Look, I'm sorry.
You know, when I was your age, I--

47:15.002 --> 47:16.879
You don't need
another dad lecture, do you?

47:20.966 --> 47:22.092
Hey, Beans.

47:23.510 --> 47:25.387
You ever hear of Kyusho Jitsu?

47:25.387 --> 47:27.472
- Kyusho what?
- Kyusho Jitsu.

47:27.472 --> 47:30.767
It's a 13th-century martial art
that uses pressure points

47:30.767 --> 47:33.395
to inflict extreme pain
without permanent damage.

47:33.395 --> 47:35.147
How do you even know about that?

47:36.023 --> 47:38.609
Well, maybe there's more
to your old man than you thought.

47:43.864 --> 47:46.867
Nina, you gotta let go
of these stereotypical--

47:51.455 --> 47:53.874
How was that for "stereotypical,"

47:53.874 --> 48:00.255
you unbearably pompous,
bloviating piece of sanctimonious shit?

48:01.965 --> 48:03.091
Smile.

48:04.927 --> 48:06.094
You deserve more.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.570
- What did you say to her?
- It was just a dad lecture.

48:23.570 --> 48:24.988
God.

48:39.419 --> 48:40.462
What happened to the mirror?

48:41.505 --> 48:42.506
The mirror.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.175
- You didn't hear that?
- No.

48:45.175 --> 48:48.178
It was a semi. It went flying by.
The guy must have been doing a hundred.

48:48.178 --> 48:49.471
And rocks just come

48:49.471 --> 48:50.764
- spitting out of the tire.
- Jesus.

48:50.764 --> 48:52.933
One hit there.
It almost hit the windshield.

49:07.948 --> 49:08.991
What the--

49:12.494 --> 49:13.495
We got him.

49:13.495 --> 49:14.705
We really got you.

49:14.705 --> 49:16.623
You were so scared.

49:41.398 --> 49:44.359
So, did you tell Mom
that I quit the paper?

49:47.070 --> 49:48.280
No. Did you want me to?

49:50.282 --> 49:51.366
I was kidding.

49:51.366 --> 49:52.784
No. I--

49:53.410 --> 49:57.539
I was just kind of thinking
about maybe getting my position back.

49:59.583 --> 50:02.461
Yeah? That's cool.

50:03.212 --> 50:04.796
Only do it if you want to.

50:05.839 --> 50:07.090
I gotta tell you, Beans.

50:07.883 --> 50:10.427
You've got a hell of a voice,
and it deserves to be heard.

50:11.553 --> 50:15.432
Hey. No BS. All right?

50:15.432 --> 50:17.726
I'm serious. That piece you wrote
about pervasive corruption

50:17.726 --> 50:21.021
in the Board of Education--
My God. I got chills.

50:21.897 --> 50:23.148
You actually read that?

50:23.148 --> 50:24.483
Of course I did.

50:25.067 --> 50:27.069
Come on. I'm your biggest fan, Beans.

50:27.069 --> 50:28.987
Always have been, and I always will be.

50:29.905 --> 50:31.031
And so is your mom.

50:32.032 --> 50:33.242
And so are your brothers.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.452
Max just hasn't told you yet.

50:38.705 --> 50:39.873
Oh, a smile.

50:39.873 --> 50:41.333
Wow. Holy shit.

50:41.333 --> 50:43.544
- Oh, my God.
- No, I didn't.

50:43.544 --> 50:45.420
That was-- No.

50:45.420 --> 50:47.172
I mean it. I'm proud of you.

50:48.465 --> 50:49.466
Thanks.

51:03.689 --> 51:05.858
Max is fed and settled in the kids' room.

51:06.441 --> 51:08.360
I am so ready for a real bed.

51:13.282 --> 51:14.324
What?

51:16.785 --> 51:17.619
Nothing.

51:24.126 --> 51:25.502
- Hey now.
- Hey.

51:26.378 --> 51:27.379
You wanna lose that?

51:32.634 --> 51:33.677
Wait.

51:34.261 --> 51:35.470
It's not Thursday.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.517
Okay.

51:45.189 --> 51:46.565
Fuck.

51:51.778 --> 51:52.988
Wow.

51:53.488 --> 51:55.157
What was that?

51:56.575 --> 52:00.245
That felt like-- That felt--

52:01.830 --> 52:02.873
That was long overdue.

52:02.873 --> 52:04.291
That was--

52:05.250 --> 52:07.753
- That's what that was.
- That felt--

52:08.754 --> 52:10.339
That felt different.

52:10.339 --> 52:12.132
- Different good, I hope.
- Different like--

52:12.841 --> 52:15.302
I was cheating on Dan with other Dan.

52:16.303 --> 52:19.348
- That different.
- No. I mean-- No. It was--

52:19.348 --> 52:22.351
Don't get me wrong. That was so hot.
That was like...

52:23.644 --> 52:24.937
What got into you?

52:26.438 --> 52:27.439
I don't know.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.107
Maybe it's being away, or...

52:30.400 --> 52:34.738
maybe it was seeing you upside-down
on that keg shouting, "Beer me!"

52:40.244 --> 52:42.204
Is this what you used to be like?

52:43.163 --> 52:44.206
Other Dan.

52:45.332 --> 52:47.125
Did you change because of me?

52:49.753 --> 52:50.754
No.

52:51.964 --> 52:56.301
Look, I changed because
I didn't like who I was back then.

52:57.219 --> 52:58.470
Then I met you.

53:00.013 --> 53:01.223
Then I became a dad.

53:02.266 --> 53:05.269
And for the first time
in a long time, I felt good.

53:05.853 --> 53:07.437
I just took it too far.

53:07.437 --> 53:08.981
I got too comfortable. Too safe.

53:08.981 --> 53:11.567
- And that probably came across as boring...
- Well...

53:11.567 --> 53:12.985
- ...and maybe neglectful...
- ...for what it's worth...

53:12.985 --> 53:16.029
- ...and I'll never do that again.
- ...I really like both Dans.

53:16.029 --> 53:17.447
- Do you?
- Yeah.

53:17.447 --> 53:18.949
Well, I'm already here, so...

53:19.533 --> 53:23.370
- How convenient.
- Yeah.

53:27.791 --> 53:30.085
- Hello?
- <i>Augie? We're on track tonight.</i>

53:30.085 --> 53:32.171
Aria bar, 6:00 p.m.
Do you have everything?

53:32.171 --> 53:34.923
Some of my finest work. If I may say so.

53:34.923 --> 53:37.426
What, better than that passport
that got me cavity searched in Bogotá?

53:39.469 --> 53:41.638
You're never gonna let me
forget that, are you?

53:41.638 --> 53:44.141
Yeah, sure. The day I forget
the snap of that latex glove.

53:44.141 --> 53:45.517
<i>Have you told them yet?</i>

53:45.517 --> 53:46.602
I'm working on it, all right?

53:46.602 --> 53:48.937
It's not exactly easy
to work into a conversation.

53:48.937 --> 53:50.480
You know, they might think
that something is up

53:50.480 --> 53:52.733
when they have to change their name
and leave the country.

53:52.733 --> 53:54.276
What are you waiting for?

53:54.276 --> 53:57.154
I said I'm working on it, Augie.
All right? Give me a break.

54:08.415 --> 54:09.625
Look, Jess.

54:11.210 --> 54:13.003
There's something that I need to tell you.

54:14.338 --> 54:15.839
About the other Dan.

54:16.965 --> 54:18.842
The Dan I was before we met.

54:18.842 --> 54:21.345
Dad? Who you talking to?

54:22.095 --> 54:23.180
Nobody. Sit down.

54:25.307 --> 54:26.558
Girls aren't ready yet.

54:28.810 --> 54:30.187
So, Kyllboi, huh?

54:30.979 --> 54:32.272
Why didn't you tell us?

54:33.106 --> 54:35.067
I knew you'd never get it,

54:35.067 --> 54:37.528
that you'd just freak out
and ban me for even longer.

54:37.528 --> 54:39.613
- Here you go.
- I wasn't trying to punish you, you know.

54:39.613 --> 54:41.240
We just wanted you
to have other interests.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.492
Make some friends.
Be a little bit more normal.

54:43.492 --> 54:47.037
I have friends. Okay? Thousands of them.

54:47.704 --> 54:49.748
People like me when I'm Kyllboi, okay?

54:49.748 --> 54:51.166
I like me.

54:51.166 --> 54:54.253
But when I'm Kyle,
I'm too shy to talk to girls.

54:54.253 --> 54:57.381
You know, I'm not good enough
to make the baseball team.

54:57.881 --> 54:59.132
I'm a nobody.

54:59.883 --> 55:02.386
But when I'm Kyllboi, I'm good, Dad.

55:02.386 --> 55:04.221
Like pro-level good.

55:05.764 --> 55:07.349
Look, okay.

55:07.349 --> 55:09.184
I know you think
it's all just a waste of time,

55:09.184 --> 55:11.562
but it takes brains and reflexes.

55:12.104 --> 55:13.522
The Air Force recruits gamers.

55:13.522 --> 55:15.691
Yeah. Maybe that's what I'm afraid of.

55:21.655 --> 55:23.907
- Let me show you.
- Show me what?

55:23.907 --> 55:26.785
- What I can do.
- Laser tag?

55:26.785 --> 55:28.245
You can't be serious.

55:28.245 --> 55:32.291
Single combat, okay? If I win,
I get to start gaming again.

55:32.291 --> 55:33.667
If you win, the ban remains.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.419
What, I don't get anything?

55:35.419 --> 55:37.296
Okay, fine. What do you want?

55:37.796 --> 55:39.840
A catch. Like we used to.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.551
You and me in the backyard,
throwing a ball every day for six months.

55:42.551 --> 55:44.428
Dad, I'm not 12.

55:44.428 --> 55:46.930
Well, you're gonna smoke me anyway.
Right, Mr. Brains and Reflexes?

55:46.930 --> 55:48.265
Fine. Good luck.

55:48.265 --> 55:49.308
You are so screwed.

55:51.518 --> 55:52.519
Let's go.

55:52.519 --> 55:54.897
You're green. You're blue.

55:54.897 --> 55:56.607
Once you're hit,
you're out for five seconds.

55:56.607 --> 55:58.734
First one to three kills, wins.

55:58.734 --> 56:00.152
You just pull the trigger?

56:02.029 --> 56:03.488
<i>Death match.</i>

56:03.488 --> 56:04.990
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

56:04.990 --> 56:08.660
<i>Three, two, one, fight.</i>

56:08.660 --> 56:10.120
Go easy on me, buddy.

56:13.290 --> 56:15.834
Dad. Come on.
I'll give you a free one, yeah?

56:15.834 --> 56:16.793
All right.

56:24.510 --> 56:26.595
<i>- First blood.
- </i>  I got lucky there.

56:27.721 --> 56:28.722
All right. That's one.

56:35.938 --> 56:36.980
How are you doing this?

56:37.481 --> 56:38.899
No. No, don't--

56:42.736 --> 56:46.198
Hey, Kyllboi. I thought you wanted
to play laser tag, not hide-and-seek.

56:54.248 --> 56:58.293
You sneaky little shit.
You're getting pretty good at this, Kyle.

57:01.964 --> 57:03.674
Well, at least I don't need a DNA test.

57:03.674 --> 57:04.967
<i>Sudden death.</i>

57:16.770 --> 57:18.105
<i>Game over.</i>

57:20.399 --> 57:22.818
Kyle, come on. Don't be mad.

57:23.610 --> 57:24.820
You conned me.

57:24.820 --> 57:26.989
You're a laser tag savant.

57:26.989 --> 57:28.407
No. I was a kid in the '80s.

57:28.407 --> 57:30.242
Yeah, like there were lasers back then.

57:31.201 --> 57:33.912
Come on, pal. You were good in there.

57:33.912 --> 57:35.747
You adapted quickly. You got creative.

57:35.747 --> 57:37.082
You almost had me.

57:38.292 --> 57:40.836
And I gotta admit,
I really enjoyed doing that with you.

57:41.420 --> 57:42.838
I mean, it meant a lot to me.

57:44.464 --> 57:45.591
Are we good?

57:46.466 --> 57:48.010
Come on. Give me some love.

57:48.802 --> 57:50.554
Real love. Yeah.

57:52.181 --> 57:55.350
- Not bad for an old man, huh?
- Yeah. For sure.

57:56.518 --> 57:59.521
Hey. What do you say, <i>mamacita</i>?

58:00.355 --> 58:01.773
Home stretch. You ready?

58:01.773 --> 58:03.025
- Vegas!
- Are you ready?

58:03.025 --> 58:04.651
Maxie.

58:13.827 --> 58:16.038
- I love you.
- I love you.

58:26.256 --> 58:28.467
It's amazing.

58:32.221 --> 58:33.931
<i>Oh, home</i>

58:33.931 --> 58:36.308
<i>Let me come home</i>

58:37.017 --> 58:40.103
<i>Home is wherever I'm with you</i>

58:40.687 --> 58:45.400
<i>Oh, home, let me come home</i>

58:45.400 --> 58:48.695
<i>Home is wherever I'm with you</i>

58:56.787 --> 58:57.704
Vegas!

59:00.082 --> 59:01.083
Yeah!

59:06.338 --> 59:07.631
Donny Osmond.

59:08.549 --> 59:09.842
Adele!

59:17.850 --> 59:20.686
- Oh, my gosh.
- Well, look at this. We got a spot.

59:20.686 --> 59:22.104
How about that?

59:29.820 --> 59:30.946
Wow!

59:30.946 --> 59:32.447
This is so cool.

59:32.447 --> 59:35.158
- Dan, the floors are so shiny.
- Look at this place!

59:37.077 --> 59:38.829
This is all ours?

59:40.080 --> 59:41.290
Oh, my God.

59:42.291 --> 59:43.292
Oh, wow.

59:43.292 --> 59:46.336
"Enjoy the suite for which
every possible promotion has been applied.

59:46.336 --> 59:49.047
You have a 7:00 p.m. reservation
at La Maison D'Or.

59:49.047 --> 59:52.217
Thank you for being exceptional members.
Levon." How nice.

59:53.927 --> 59:54.928
What?

59:54.928 --> 59:56.889
- Nina?
- Yep.

59:56.889 --> 59:58.557
You have to look at this tub.

59:58.557 --> 01:00:01.226
I gotta run downstairs for a sec.
Don't let them raid the minibar, okay?

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.437
That is not mini.

01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:04.813
Oh, my God.

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:07.691
Oh, my God. Yes!

01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:14.364
Hey.

01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:18.035
Look at you, playing the family man.

01:00:18.035 --> 01:00:19.661
I'm not playing. This is my life.

01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:22.414
You see any sign of trouble
on your way in?

01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:24.583
- Uh-uh.
- Me neither.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.211
I mean, I messed up, stopping in Iowa,
but I think we're in the clear.

01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:30.047
Well, then enjoy your last night
as Dan Morgan, my friend.

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:34.051
I've got you on a flight to Vancouver
in the morning under your new identities.

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:36.595
Hey. You're a lifesaver, Augs. Thank you.

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:39.014
Try to get out of Vegas
with some of it, huh?

01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:41.141
I promise nothing.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.602
How did the family take the news?

01:00:44.353 --> 01:00:46.939
I haven't told them yet.
I'm telling Jess at dinner.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:50.400
- I suggest a Japanese restaurant.
- Why?

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.152
No knives.

01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:16.760
Wow. You look incredible.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.845
I know.

01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:19.930
Wow! What a lucky guy I am.

01:01:21.098 --> 01:01:22.307
Wow!

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:25.143
Come on.

01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:31.817
Hey. All right. You two are on Max.

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:34.069
You're not to leave this suite
under any circumstance.

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:36.822
There's food in the supersized minibar.
You do not open that door for anyone.

01:01:36.822 --> 01:01:38.115
- You got it?
- Got it.

01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:39.241
What about you, Maxie?

01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:42.911
- You got it?
- Yeah? All right. Have fun. Be good.

01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:51.587
- Screw that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:51.587 --> 01:01:52.880
Ready?

01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:54.506
Let's go.

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:57.551
Yeah.

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:02.681
Excited.

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:18.572
Wow.

01:02:18.572 --> 01:02:21.074
Hey, let's go to HyperX.
I wanna see the esports arena.

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:24.995
No way. No, I'm not spending my time
in an arena full of Kyles. I'm not going.

01:02:24.995 --> 01:02:27.122
Sucks to suck. Me and Max are going.

01:02:30.459 --> 01:02:32.294
- Hello, Elvis.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:44.473 --> 01:02:45.516
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:13.669
All right. I think it's just down here.
You're gonna love it.

01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:15.087
I already hate it.

01:03:15.712 --> 01:03:21.301
<i>Welcome to the HyperX Arena.
Five minutes until our final round.</i>

01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:25.013
This is sick.

01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:26.807
Smells like your room on steroids.

01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:27.891
Thanks.

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:29.518
That's Ren.

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:31.895
Hi. Sorry. Big fan.

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:33.772
Thanks. Wait. You're...

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:37.192
- Kyllboi.
- Yeah. I've seen your streams.

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:38.902
Thanks.

01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:41.947
Hey.

01:03:42.573 --> 01:03:44.324
Do you wanna meet Valkyrae and the others?

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:46.326
Hell yeah.

01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:48.245
Okay. I have a gift for you.

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:50.372
- Okay.
- Take him.

01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:55.878
Thank you very much.

01:03:58.172 --> 01:03:59.381
- To us.
- Yeah.

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:02.551
I can't believe we actually did it.

01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:03.886
- We're here.
- Yep.

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:05.470
We're here.

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:06.680
Look, Jess,

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.640
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Hang on.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.975
- Come here.
- What?

01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:11.768
Oh, my God.

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.439
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.984
Sorry. I interrupted.

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:22.696
No, it's okay. It's just--
The reason that we came on this trip--

01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:28.493
What I was saying was--

01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:30.078
Would you like some pepper?

01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:32.289
I don't want pepper.

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:34.208
I want to be alone with my wife.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.251
I don't actually speak French.

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:38.045
They just teach us enough to sound fancy.

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:41.340
I'll give you a minute.

01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:45.010
You speak French too?

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.764
I took some French back in the day.

01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:51.266
It's literally kind of weird
that you've never mentioned to me

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:53.644
that you speak two foreign languages.

01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:58.065
How good are you?

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.486
I don't know, it has been a while.

01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:04.571
I have traveled around the world.

01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:08.992
Despite that,
it's hard to tell you the truth.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:12.454
I'm afraid to break your heart.

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:16.458
I don't know if you will still love me...

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:19.711
once you know who I truly am.

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:24.007
I'm sorry that you're
being pulled into this...

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.300
but I swear on my life...

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.344
that I'll never let any person...

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:31.974
hurt you or the kids.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.311
That was crazy sexy.

01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:39.523
Why does everything sound
so much better in French?

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:41.066
Well, it's an innately melodic language.

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:43.026
At some point,
you and I are gonna have to talk

01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:44.903
about why you never told me
you can do that.

01:05:44.903 --> 01:05:47.614
I mean, it's crazy you didn't tell me.

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:51.034
We should also talk
about how insane you've been acting

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:52.953
ever since you showed up
and whisked us off to Vegas.

01:05:52.953 --> 01:05:55.706
But right now,
I just wanna be here with you.

01:05:55.706 --> 01:05:57.916
I wanna be eating this amazing food,

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:00.002
and drinking this champagne
we can't afford,

01:06:00.878 --> 01:06:03.505
and enjoying each other's company,
and just maybe...

01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:11.221
showing that ridiculous hotel suite
some moves it has never seen before.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.893
I don't know about you, but that
sounds like a pretty perfect night.

01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:21.481
- What rank are you?
- Ascendant 3.

01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:24.067
Damn. Really? That's better than him.

01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:26.069
That's incredible.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:28.113
- Oh, my.
- How long you been playing for?

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:29.990
I mean, since the game came out.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.742
It's cool your brother's Kyllboi.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:34.620
- Is it?
- Yeah. He's the real deal.

01:06:37.915 --> 01:06:39.875
So, is this your...

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:42.920
No. Oh, God. No.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.589
- I found him. Just over there.
- Over there?

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:48.342
- Yeah.
- Just hanging out?

01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.719
It's time for the finals.

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:56.099
Team Valkyrae
and Team iiTzTimmy onto the stage!

01:07:00.103 --> 01:07:02.022
Hey, let's go.

01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:07.277
Use Kyllboi.

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:10.781
Are you up for it?

01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:12.157
The finals?

01:07:12.157 --> 01:07:14.409
Yeah, this is one of those moments, man.
Are you in or out?

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:20.123
- In.
- Let's go. Yeah.

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.333
- Okay.
- Don't be nervous.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:23.544
- It'll be a piece of cake.
- Thanks.

01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:25.128
Hey, that was kind of cool of you.

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.382
Not really. They're gonna get destroyed.

01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:31.718
What's up, everyone?

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:34.555
Take a seat, Kyllboi, right next to me.

01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:57.452
Do you have ammo?

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.329
I'm gonna try and block us off real quick.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.126
Above here.

01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:07.337
Let's go.

01:08:08.714 --> 01:08:10.799
- Good job.
- Okay. Next.

01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.342
No more bets.

01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:16.889
- Oh, shoot!
- I'm gonna call the kids.

01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:18.055
Okay. Yeah.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:22.603
Check B Main right now.

01:08:22.603 --> 01:08:24.604
- Nice shot.
- Here's the last one.

01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:26.106
He satcheled in.

01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:29.609
- Are you serious? What was that?
- Nice!

01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:32.487
That was so sick!

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:43.916
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:46.502
Hey, the kids aren't answering.
You wanna head back up?

01:08:47.085 --> 01:08:48.795
Yeah. Let's do it. Okay.

01:08:57.179 --> 01:08:59.264
Jess. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:06.229
They okay?

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.731
They're good.

01:09:10.442 --> 01:09:12.486
Look, I'm so sorry we cut the night short.
I didn't--

01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:13.779
Who says we did?

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:19.243
Give me 30 seconds to freshen up,
and then meet me in bed.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:20.327
Okay.

01:09:48.856 --> 01:09:50.189
Okay.

01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:53.193
Mood.

01:10:04.788 --> 01:10:05.998
Love mist.

01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:10.919
Jess!

01:10:24.183 --> 01:10:25.142
Dan?

01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:51.710
- Oh, my God.
- There he is.

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:53.378
Dan?

01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:55.547
- I've been looking for you.
- Dan.

01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:00.844
Dan.

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:04.306
Easy, Coogan.

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:07.392
You got me. You win.

01:11:13.857 --> 01:11:15.359
Just let her go.

01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:18.862
- She doesn't know anything.
- Well, I'd say she does now, Sean.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:22.741
Yeah. So here's how this is gonna go.

01:11:23.575 --> 01:11:24.618
First, I'm gonna kill you.

01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:26.537
And then I'm gonna kill her.

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:30.791
And then I'm gonna have my associate
at HyperX kill your kids.

01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:33.752
How's that sound?

01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:40.425
I can explain.

01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:50.435
That's normal, honey.
Everybody barfs their first time.

01:11:52.521 --> 01:11:53.814
Give me one second.

01:12:01.655 --> 01:12:02.698
What?

01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:04.992
Oh, my God.

01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:08.537
Jess, wait. Where are you going?

01:12:09.037 --> 01:12:10.205
HyperX.

01:12:18.714 --> 01:12:21.925
So, do you want me to talk,
or do you have things to say?

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:24.052
- Do I have things to say?
- Right. Sorry.

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:26.513
I have eyeball on me, Sean.

01:12:27.097 --> 01:12:28.307
Fucking eyeball.

01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:32.519
- Jess.
- Shut up. Shut up!

01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:35.022
I don't wanna hear it.
I don't even wanna look at you.

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:36.356
I just wanna find my kids,

01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:39.610
who don't have their goddamn phones
because you threw them away!

01:12:42.863 --> 01:12:44.907
Kyllboi, it's just you and me.

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.994
Take this guy. Breach.

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:53.165
Watch out!

01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:56.627
- I have a rez.
- Okay.

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:01.340
Oh, no.

01:13:03.008 --> 01:13:04.676
- Shit on!
- Oh, my God.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:06.845
It's all on you, man.

01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:08.430
To the left. Nice shot.

01:13:10.599 --> 01:13:12.476
- Nice. One more.
- Coming.

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.441
- Let's go!
- Yes! Yes!

01:13:20.234 --> 01:13:22.152
We have a winner!

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:25.822
- Team Valkyrae wins!
- Yes!

01:13:27.783 --> 01:13:29.576
Doesn't get much closer than that.

01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:32.496
Kyllboi! Kyllboi! That's right.

01:13:32.496 --> 01:13:35.749
- Kyllboi!
- Give it up!

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.714
- It's Kyllboi.
- Who's Kyllboi?

01:13:43.215 --> 01:13:44.383
Kyllboi!

01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:45.467
Kyle?

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.302
Oh, shit. Kyle!

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:50.472
- Hey!
- Where's your brother?

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:52.516
That's a funny story.
He's literally right there.

01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:54.142
- No. Your other brother.
- Okay, yeah. He's fine.

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:55.227
He's good. He's with Ren.

01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:56.687
- What?
- Excuse me.

01:13:56.687 --> 01:13:58.313
See?

01:13:58.313 --> 01:14:01.692
- He's fine. Max is great. Heya.
- Hey.

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:03.902
- Okay. Call me.
- Listen.

01:14:03.902 --> 01:14:05.988
I know you guys are mad--

01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:07.906
Listen, that's me they're cheering for.

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:10.367
- What were you thinking?
- Well, Max is fine.

01:14:10.367 --> 01:14:12.327
Okay, look. Guys,
we don't have time for this, okay?

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:13.662
We need to get out of this city.

01:14:13.662 --> 01:14:14.913
Overreact much?

01:14:14.913 --> 01:14:17.040
Wait. Why do we have to leave?

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.709
Because.

01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:20.794
- Jess, tell them, please.
- This is all on you.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.798
We have to leave because
my former coworkers are trying to kill us.

01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:26.425
What? From Planet Car Deals?

01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:28.260
I'm not kidding around. Ask Max.

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:30.804
Before I met your mom,
I was a covert assassin.

01:14:30.804 --> 01:14:32.514
I escaped that life,
and now they've found us.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:38.270
Dad, you are, like,
the biggest wimp on the planet.

01:14:39.605 --> 01:14:42.274
Thank you. Move. Go! Now!

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:44.818
Go, go.

01:14:46.195 --> 01:14:47.779
Find an exit.

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:54.203
- Move, guys. Come on.
- Go. Go.

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:01.293
- Dad?
- What the fuck?

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:02.961
I'm gonna draw her fire, okay?

01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:06.632
When I do, take the kids that way.
I'll be right behind you, okay?

01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:40.123
Go.

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:45.003
Jess, she's coming. Wait here.

01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:46.964
- Okay.
- Wait right here.

01:15:58.475 --> 01:15:59.726
It's okay, honey.

01:15:59.726 --> 01:16:01.728
Everyone barfs the first time.

01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:08.068
Come on, we gotta go. Come on. Let's go.

01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:12.114
Move, guys. Go.

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:33.510
My real name is Sean.

01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:35.888
My mother died when I was four.

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:37.556
My father was prone to violence.

01:16:37.556 --> 01:16:39.808
When I turned 18,
it was straight into the army.

01:16:40.309 --> 01:16:43.020
I dunno. Maybe it was his genes
coming out, but I thrived.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.771
I was a Green Beret. I was a Delta.

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:47.441
And then I was approached
by a man named McCaffrey.

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:48.901
Former SAS.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:52.404
He took my training to a whole other level
and recruited me into a special program.

01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:55.866
- It was a chance to do some real good.
- What kind of special program?

01:16:55.866 --> 01:16:57.659
We took out the worst of the worst.

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.287
Terrorists, warlords,
kidnappers all over the world.

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:02.039
Ones the government
couldn't legally touch.

01:17:02.039 --> 01:17:03.624
Took out, as in...

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:06.793
- Well, how many?
- Twenty-six.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:09.463
- You've killed 26 pe--
- No.

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:11.757
No, I went on 26 operations.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.008
Oh, God.

01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:15.844
- Thirty-nine people.
- That's more!

01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:19.932
- Are we including this trip?
- Total dead people, Dan!

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:21.266
- Dad.
- Forty-three.

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:23.185
They were all bad.

01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:26.939
- You are such a hypocrite.
- All bad people.

01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:31.527
You took away the one thing I'm good at
because there's fake violence,

01:17:31.527 --> 01:17:32.653
and you're a serial killer?

01:17:32.653 --> 01:17:35.322
Dad, you were working
for the good guys, right?

01:17:35.322 --> 01:17:37.074
McCaffrey was a father figure.

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:38.909
I trusted him, but I was naive.

01:17:38.909 --> 01:17:40.744
I mean, it started out legit.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:43.997
But he got greedy and began
farming us out as mercenaries

01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:45.207
to the highest bidder.

01:17:45.207 --> 01:17:47.709
And as soon as I found out, I left.
All right?

01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:50.754
I fought my way out,
but that meant turning against my friends,

01:17:50.754 --> 01:17:53.924
my mentor, against the only real family
that I'd ever known.

01:17:53.924 --> 01:17:55.551
So they've been hunting you ever since.

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:59.137
- Yeah.
- I am such an idiot.

01:18:00.013 --> 01:18:03.267
This is why you're so secretive,
why you never wanna go anywhere.

01:18:03.267 --> 01:18:06.353
Why you're so weird about social media.

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:08.564
Why you're so anti-technology.

01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:11.817
Well, with facial recognition software,
I had no choice.

01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:14.987
Plus, I really do think that social media
is fundamentally disgusting and gross.

01:18:14.987 --> 01:18:17.739
- God.
- But now that they found us, what happens?

01:18:17.739 --> 01:18:18.949
I got it figured out.

01:18:19.992 --> 01:18:21.243
We're good.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.288
That's yours.

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:27.207
And that's yours. And that's yours.

01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:30.252
"Molly Anderson"?

01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:31.962
At least you got a real name.

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:33.463
I'm Van.

01:18:33.463 --> 01:18:34.923
I'm a vehicle.

01:18:34.923 --> 01:18:36.216
Van?

01:18:36.216 --> 01:18:38.427
Look, we can't go back to Buffalo,
all right?

01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:40.095
Those lives are over. I'm sorry.

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:44.308
I finally have a life,
and you're ruining it.

01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:49.188
- Thanks, Dad.
- Kyle, come back.

01:18:49.188 --> 01:18:52.774
Dad, no. You don't get to tell us
what to do anymore.

01:18:52.774 --> 01:18:54.943
- Ever.
- Come--

01:18:57.571 --> 01:18:59.907
- Eighteen years of lies.
- I'm still the man you married.

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:02.576
- I was just something different before.
- Something different?

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:04.953
You weren't in a band or vegan, Dan.

01:19:04.953 --> 01:19:06.914
That would be something different.

01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:09.333
You were an assassin for hire.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:11.043
I kept the truth from you
to protect you, okay?

01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:14.171
- But our love was real.
- Real? Are you serious?

01:19:14.796 --> 01:19:16.757
What, was it so real
that you couldn't trust me

01:19:16.757 --> 01:19:18.759
with knowing how much danger we were in?

01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:20.761
What did you think?

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:25.182
That I'd go blabbing about it
on the moms' school text chain?

01:19:25.182 --> 01:19:26.934
- No. I--
- Or were you afraid I'd leave you,

01:19:26.934 --> 01:19:28.393
knowing who you really are?

01:19:28.393 --> 01:19:30.437
We were just some disguise for you,

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:33.065
just some part of your cover
as a suburban schlub?

01:19:33.065 --> 01:19:36.193
- What? No.
- Fuck, you must have resented us. Right?

01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:40.280
Every single day, eking out a living,
wiping kids' asses, driving a minivan.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.241
I love that minivan.

01:19:42.241 --> 01:19:46.828
I mean, all of a sudden you're, like,
what, James Bond, and now you're what?

01:19:46.828 --> 01:19:48.080
Normal.

01:19:48.747 --> 01:19:52.459
A normal guy with a normal,
wonderful, perfect life.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:54.169
That's all I've ever wanted.

01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:56.046
I mean, you were a decathlete.

01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:57.422
You should've medaled in Athens.

01:19:57.422 --> 01:19:58.966
Do you resent your life as a mom?

01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:00.050
Sometimes.

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:02.135
Yes.

01:20:02.845 --> 01:20:03.971
I don't wanna be that guy.

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.140
I wish I could believe you.

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:09.560
I really do.

01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:11.645
But to be honest,

01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:14.898
this trip is the happiest
that I have seen you in years.

01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:20.737
A trip in which
you have killed four people.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:22.948
I mean, is this really you?

01:20:26.326 --> 01:20:29.413
You're a stranger named Sean.

01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:35.419
"Archibald Anderson."

01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:37.880
Oh, damn it, Augie.

01:20:39.006 --> 01:20:43.093
You know, first thing in the morning,
I am taking the kids and I am leaving.

01:20:43.719 --> 01:20:45.971
- Jess, it's not safe.
- It's not safe with you.

01:20:46.763 --> 01:20:48.056
They're after you, not us.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:51.018
And from now on, I'm making
the decisions about me and the kids.

01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:54.771
Jess.

01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:07.034
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for picking up.

01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:08.118
I know it's late.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:12.623
I was wondering if you could help
with some travel for my family, please.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.653
- Where are you going?
- Far from here, far from you.

01:21:42.653 --> 01:21:44.488
- Where?
- It's none of your business.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:45.697
What? Like hell it isn't.

01:21:45.697 --> 01:21:47.991
Hey, you cannot go to the airport,
you know. They're gonna be waiting there.

01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:50.285
Well, we're not.
We've made other arrangements.

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:51.370
What other arrangements?

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:54.081
Sorry, Dan. Can't say.
It's to protect you.

01:21:54.081 --> 01:21:56.083
Jess-- Oh, really? Come on. Don't--

01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:00.587
Jess. Please. It's not safe.

01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:02.923
Then handle it. Make it safe.

01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:04.925
And when you're done with it,
stay away from us.

01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:24.027
Is this for us?

01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:26.989
No, I don't think so. Couldn't be.

01:22:34.705 --> 01:22:36.623
- Hi.
- Gwen.

01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:39.960
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting all this.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.046
I was on a layover nearby, and I thought,
I'll just come get you myself.

01:22:43.839 --> 01:22:45.048
Okay.

01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:47.885
Hi. You must be Molly and Van.

01:22:48.468 --> 01:22:52.598
I'm Gwen. Hi, little one. There's
breakfast on board, if you'd like it.

01:22:52.598 --> 01:22:53.765
Sure.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:58.353
- Thanks.
- Jessica, what is wrong? Are you okay?

01:22:58.979 --> 01:23:00.647
What happened? Where's your husband?

01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:02.733
We had a fight.

01:23:03.692 --> 01:23:04.943
Oh, boy.

01:23:04.943 --> 01:23:07.529
Hey, maybe you can help me
with my guy problems then.

01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:09.198
- How about that?
- I'd love to.

01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:12.451
Remember that ex
I told you about in Buffalo?

01:23:12.451 --> 01:23:14.453
- Yeah.
- We were together for years.

01:23:14.453 --> 01:23:16.788
It was good. I mean, it was really good.

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:21.084
You know when you just can't
get enough of each other physically?

01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:25.380
I thought he was the one,
and then he just threw it all away.

01:23:25.964 --> 01:23:28.759
Married some other woman
who was the complete opposite of me.

01:23:28.759 --> 01:23:29.843
And the worst part...

01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:31.929
she's insufferable.

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:34.556
- Wait. You met her?
- I had to.

01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:36.183
He created this whole life
with this woman,

01:23:36.183 --> 01:23:38.435
and I needed to see
what she had that I didn't.

01:23:38.435 --> 01:23:39.603
What did you do?

01:23:39.603 --> 01:23:42.606
I did what I do best. I got in close,

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:47.611
I won her trust, and then I just waited
patiently for her to walk into my trap.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.579
You know, I think
I left something in the taxi.

01:23:57.579 --> 01:23:58.872
Hey, Molly?

01:23:58.872 --> 01:24:00.582
- Yeah?
- You wanna bring your brother?

01:24:00.582 --> 01:24:02.584
Let's go. We're leaving.

01:24:08.841 --> 01:24:10.884
I told you to stay off this op.

01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:14.805
And yet, who brought them to you
in a big, fat bow?

01:24:14.805 --> 01:24:16.265
You needed me.

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:18.100
I know Sean better than you ever will.

01:24:21.019 --> 01:24:22.980
Do whatever you want
with the family. I don't care.

01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:26.775
I just want Sean.
He's my payment for delivery.

01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:39.663
You couldn't let it go, could you?

01:24:39.663 --> 01:24:41.707
<i>You know me better than that.</i>

01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:43.876
Look, you can have me,

01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:46.086
but I want your word
that you won't go after my family.

01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:47.212
"Go after"?

01:24:47.838 --> 01:24:50.132
You're a little behind, buddy boy.

01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:54.636
- I swear to God, if you hurt them--
- Come and get 'em.

01:24:54.636 --> 01:24:56.054
Somewhere public.

01:24:56.054 --> 01:24:58.765
I think you're mistaking
who holds the cards here.

01:24:58.765 --> 01:25:02.519
<i>Be at the old Poseidon Casino
north of the city in 30 minutes...</i>

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.521
<i>alone.</i>

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:47.481
Come on out!

01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:54.404
Hello, old friend.

01:25:54.404 --> 01:25:56.406
He brought you in for this, huh, Spiros?

01:25:56.406 --> 01:25:58.116
He brought everybody.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:01.119
Follow me.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.753
He's alone.

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:13.131
Well, well. How sweet.

01:26:13.882 --> 01:26:15.717
He could have been halfway
around the world by now,

01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:20.222
and yet here he is, trading his life
for the family that abandoned him.

01:26:22.933 --> 01:26:25.602
So, am I ever getting back
that five grand I lent you in Morocco?

01:26:25.602 --> 01:26:26.687
I'll tell you what.

01:26:26.687 --> 01:26:30.107
If you're still alive in ten minutes,
I'll pay you back with interest.

01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:34.444
Oh, shame. It's a beautiful place.

01:26:35.153 --> 01:26:37.114
They're demolishing it in ten days.

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:49.459
All this for me? I'm flattered.

01:26:50.502 --> 01:26:51.378
How's the family?

01:26:52.045 --> 01:26:53.046
Which one?

01:26:54.548 --> 01:26:55.674
We're coming up.

01:27:11.857 --> 01:27:13.192
There he is.

01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:14.193
Are you okay?

01:27:24.453 --> 01:27:25.954
No hug for your old man?

01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:27.789
Why start now, Dad?

01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:29.833
I'm sorry, what?

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.877
I'm your grandfather, Kyle.

01:27:33.962 --> 01:27:35.923
Oh, my God. We're British.

01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:38.592
He didn't tell ya?

01:27:38.592 --> 01:27:41.762
No. He left that part
out of his no-more-lies speech.

01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:45.098
- Well, I said he was a father figure.
- Not quite the same, Dan.

01:27:45.098 --> 01:27:48.101
This is good, right?
He's not gonna kill his own grandkids.

01:27:49.019 --> 01:27:51.813
Look, do whatever you want with me.
Let them go.

01:27:51.813 --> 01:27:54.107
What is it you think I want, Sean?

01:27:54.608 --> 01:27:55.609
Kill me.

01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:59.029
In that spider's nest of a heart,
you actually think that I wronged you.

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:00.447
You were my son.

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:03.242
My legacy.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:07.621
I poured everything I am into you.
You threw it all away.

01:28:08.163 --> 01:28:10.332
You abandoned me. You broke my heart.

01:28:10.332 --> 01:28:12.167
So, yeah. I wanted you dead.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.963
But then something happened
over these past few days.

01:28:15.963 --> 01:28:19.049
You wasted every single guy I sent at you.
Every goddamn one.

01:28:20.384 --> 01:28:23.720
You are every bit the killer
I taught you to be.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.265
No. It's not who I am anymore.

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.349
Bullshit.

01:28:28.976 --> 01:28:31.019
Tell me you didn't feel more alive
the past three days

01:28:31.019 --> 01:28:33.021
than you have done in years.

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:36.900
And as you smoked each of my men,

01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:41.864
I felt something that I haven't felt
in a very long time.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.450
Pride in my son.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:46.702
What? So, what is this?

01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:49.580
Now you don't wanna kill me?
What the hell do you want?

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.914
I want you back.

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.082
What?

01:28:52.082 --> 01:28:54.168
Things were never as good after you left.

01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:57.921
For any of us.

01:28:58.964 --> 01:29:04.303
So, I want my son back,
working by my side in the family business.

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:06.847
You're not seriously considering this,

01:29:06.847 --> 01:29:08.849
- are you, Dad?
- Quiet, Kyle.

01:29:08.849 --> 01:29:11.643
Everybody wins.
You come back where you belong.

01:29:12.144 --> 01:29:13.645
Be who you were born to be.

01:29:14.438 --> 01:29:16.523
Jess and the kids
go safely back to Buffalo.

01:29:16.523 --> 01:29:18.233
It's what they want anyway.

01:29:20.152 --> 01:29:22.154
Sure beats the shit out of selling cars.

01:29:23.322 --> 01:29:26.450
But no contact.
Can't have you going soft on me again.

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.493
I'm their father.
There's no way this is gonna happen.

01:29:30.537 --> 01:29:32.080
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:29:35.626 --> 01:29:37.044
Start with the wife.

01:29:37.044 --> 01:29:39.713
- Wait, no! I--
- There's no third option!

01:29:39.713 --> 01:29:42.049
Either it all ends here and now,

01:29:42.049 --> 01:29:46.637
or you give your family
exactly what they want and then some!

01:29:53.519 --> 01:29:54.394
I'll do it.

01:29:57.981 --> 01:29:58.982
Okay.

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:04.613
Spiros, see the family to the airport
with our blessing.

01:30:25.092 --> 01:30:26.593
Dad.

01:30:29.096 --> 01:30:30.305
Dad, please.

01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:32.307
I love you. I'll always love you.

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:38.605
Look, we can't just abandon Dad.

01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:40.357
What am I supposed to do?

01:30:40.357 --> 01:30:42.901
It's my job to keep you safe.

01:30:42.901 --> 01:30:43.986
I'm a mom.

01:30:43.986 --> 01:30:46.071
Okay, then be the mom that lifts the car.

01:30:46.071 --> 01:30:47.614
- What?
- You know, the mom.

01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:49.366
She has the baby, and she lifts the car.

01:30:49.366 --> 01:30:50.701
Yeah. You know. Car mom.

01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:53.453
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:30:54.329 --> 01:30:56.290
It's an urban legend, Mrs. Morgan.

01:30:57.583 --> 01:31:00.210
A baby is trapped under a car.

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:05.382
His mother gets a burst of adrenaline
and lifts the car up with her bare hands.

01:31:07.426 --> 01:31:10.429
Your children are suggesting
you overpower me to rescue their father.

01:31:10.429 --> 01:31:12.097
Yeah. Thank you. Exactly.

01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:13.390
I would advise against it.

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:15.350
Now. Duh.

01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:16.935
Your father made his choice.

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:19.521
I mean, do you think he wants this?

01:31:20.105 --> 01:31:21.773
It's Dad that we're talking about.

01:31:21.773 --> 01:31:25.360
The guy that took me to junior prom
when Trevor didn't show up.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.364
The guy that wakes us up for school
with shitty raps about Wednesdays.

01:31:29.865 --> 01:31:32.201
That's beautiful.
My father never did that.

01:31:32.201 --> 01:31:34.119
I'm sorry. Can you shut up, Spiros?

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:40.626
Hey. Stop.

01:31:45.756 --> 01:31:47.049
Children.

01:31:47.049 --> 01:31:48.759
Mom, we're not a family without Dad.

01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:50.677
Dad needs to know that we don't want this.

01:31:50.677 --> 01:31:53.972
I know we said we did last night,
but, Mom, I don't.

01:31:56.683 --> 01:32:00.354
If he still chooses to do it,
then so be it.

01:32:00.354 --> 01:32:01.688
But he needs to know.

01:32:03.065 --> 01:32:05.859
I mean, he thinks
that we don't love him anymore, Mom.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.111
We can't just let things end like that.

01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:13.825
Oh, Max.

01:32:14.826 --> 01:32:16.578
I haven't changed you.

01:32:16.578 --> 01:32:19.706
We have to get this off of you
before you get a rash.

01:32:19.706 --> 01:32:20.999
You forgot the diaper bag.

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:24.670
Oh, my gosh.

01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:27.172
Ooh, gosh. It's a real messy one.

01:32:38.183 --> 01:32:39.393
Oh, crap.

01:32:41.854 --> 01:32:43.230
Maybe he'll be all right.

01:32:44.064 --> 01:32:45.065
Or not.

01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:46.775
What do we do now?

01:32:52.197 --> 01:32:53.782
We're gonna go find your dad.

01:32:56.493 --> 01:32:58.412
Give me a minute alone with him,
would you?

01:32:58.412 --> 01:33:00.539
I wanna be wheels up in ten minutes.

01:33:03.917 --> 01:33:06.211
I thought if I ever saw you again,
I'd kill you.

01:33:07.337 --> 01:33:09.798
But since we're here...

01:33:13.677 --> 01:33:14.970
Better.

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:17.264
Oh, sure. Pretend I'm not here.

01:33:23.145 --> 01:33:25.480
This isn't gonna happen. I have a wife.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.524
You had a wife.

01:33:28.275 --> 01:33:29.776
Now you're free.

01:33:33.697 --> 01:33:36.909
Doesn't it feel good
to be back where you belong?

01:33:36.909 --> 01:33:38.118
It's been a long time, Gwen.

01:33:45.959 --> 01:33:47.711
You think I forgot your little tricks?

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:50.130
You think I forgot this?

01:33:53.634 --> 01:33:55.469
I knew you hadn't changed.

01:33:56.345 --> 01:33:57.846
You could never resist me.

01:34:02.518 --> 01:34:03.936
Vulcan neck pinch.

01:34:03.936 --> 01:34:05.020
Kyusho Jitsu.

01:34:06.188 --> 01:34:08.065
Hey. I'm just the tech guy.

01:34:08.565 --> 01:34:09.816
I'm so sorry for this, you guys.

01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:12.152
For the ass-grabbing part
or the 18-years-of-deception thing?

01:34:12.152 --> 01:34:14.279
Both. All of it.

01:34:15.364 --> 01:34:16.698
Hey. Tie him up.

01:34:17.616 --> 01:34:19.785
- Yeah. You.
- Come on.

01:34:19.785 --> 01:34:22.287
I wanted to tell you about everything,
but there was never a good time.

01:34:22.287 --> 01:34:24.790
- Never a good time?
- When was I gonna tell you?

01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.416
On our first date? Our second?

01:34:26.416 --> 01:34:28.043
When you were pregnant with Nina
or by our fourth?

01:34:28.043 --> 01:34:30.170
- What?
- Do the math, Nina.

01:34:30.170 --> 01:34:31.880
Any of those times
would have been a better time.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:34.466
You should have told me the truth,
and I could have made up my own mind.

01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:37.469
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was stupid and selfish.

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:39.388
But I was in love with you.

01:34:39.388 --> 01:34:41.807
I mean, you've been my whole world
since the moment we met.

01:34:42.307 --> 01:34:44.476
Being your husband and their father,
that's the real me.

01:34:44.476 --> 01:34:46.061
That's all that matters to me.

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.773
All right. I swear on my life,
I'll never keep anything from you again.

01:34:56.822 --> 01:34:57.823
Where's Spiros?

01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:59.825
Thought they were with you.

01:35:07.124 --> 01:35:08.333
Hey, bro.

01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:11.837
Everyone I know is talking about
what Kyllboi did at HyperX last night.

01:35:11.837 --> 01:35:13.005
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:15.174
Kyle. Less talking, more tying, okay?

01:35:16.133 --> 01:35:17.718
Sorry.

01:35:18.969 --> 01:35:20.971
No way. A Sky Raven drone?

01:35:20.971 --> 01:35:22.139
Awesome.

01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:23.557
Just, careful with it.

01:35:25.934 --> 01:35:28.812
- Hey, man. You got a great kid.
- I need your comms.

01:35:28.812 --> 01:35:29.897
Dude!

01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:38.405
Hey, Kyle. Give me that.

01:35:42.618 --> 01:35:45.120
You're not anti-technology. You're--

01:35:48.332 --> 01:35:49.708
You're awesome.

01:35:55.047 --> 01:35:56.924
- They're coming.
- What?

01:35:56.924 --> 01:35:59.301
Go up to the roof and find somewhere
to hide with the kids, okay?

01:35:59.301 --> 01:36:01.053
No, you're not going down there.

01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:03.555
It's the only way to end this.
This is the only way we go home.

01:36:03.555 --> 01:36:05.891
We don't have to go home. We can just
go to Canada and be the Andersons.

01:36:05.891 --> 01:36:07.476
- Please, Dad.
- It's too late for that, Beans.

01:36:07.476 --> 01:36:09.561
No. You're not giving yourself up to them.

01:36:09.561 --> 01:36:11.772
No. I'm getting us home.

01:36:12.481 --> 01:36:13.649
Okay.

01:36:17.236 --> 01:36:18.237
I got a plan.

01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:23.200
Look, I need to be that guy
one last time for us.

01:36:24.243 --> 01:36:26.203
Dad. There's too many of 'em.

01:36:26.203 --> 01:36:27.829
Well, I have something they don't have.

01:36:29.122 --> 01:36:30.374
Kyllboi.

01:36:31.834 --> 01:36:34.253
That's your comms. You're my eyes
and my ears, okay? I'm counting on you.

01:36:34.253 --> 01:36:36.004
Let's go.

01:36:36.004 --> 01:36:37.214
Move out, Kyllboi.

01:36:37.923 --> 01:36:40.050
<i>Hey, Kyle,
you're on the same channel as me.</i>

01:36:43.178 --> 01:36:46.139
I want every inch of this atrium covered.

01:37:12.666 --> 01:37:14.251
Movement on the elevator!

01:37:14.877 --> 01:37:16.962
The elevator door. Now!

01:37:16.962 --> 01:37:20.174
You see a shot, you take it,
because, believe me, he will.

01:37:22.259 --> 01:37:23.260
You got a shot?

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.720
Negative. I don't see him yet.

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.081
He's not here.

01:37:53.081 --> 01:37:54.166
Wait.

01:37:57.252 --> 01:37:58.170
What do ya got?

01:37:59.713 --> 01:38:01.381
Take cover!

01:38:04.134 --> 01:38:05.511
Holy shit.

01:38:06.261 --> 01:38:07.888
Hey. See anybody?

01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:13.602
He's up there!

01:38:14.102 --> 01:38:15.020
Shit.

01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:18.607
Talk to me, Kyle.

01:38:18.607 --> 01:38:20.025
You're my eyes.

01:38:20.025 --> 01:38:21.735
You're clear on your right. Go now.

01:38:27.574 --> 01:38:28.992
<i>Dad, man on your left.</i>

01:38:36.792 --> 01:38:38.836
<i>Dad, are you okay? Man ahead.</i>

01:38:42.548 --> 01:38:43.715
Man on your six.

01:38:45.759 --> 01:38:46.927
<i>Great job, Kyle.</i>

01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:48.262
<i>I'm on it, Dad.</i>

01:38:49.596 --> 01:38:50.848
<i>Talk to me, Kyle.</i>

01:38:50.848 --> 01:38:52.850
They've got the drone.

01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:54.560
<i>Look out. Behind the curtain.</i>

01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:58.397
<i>Come on, Dad. Get him.</i>

01:39:00.357 --> 01:39:01.650
You again.

01:39:02.568 --> 01:39:04.069
They mopped your ass up
off aisle three, huh?

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.281
Gonna need that mop again.

01:39:13.245 --> 01:39:14.496
Gwen, where the hell are you?

01:39:16.164 --> 01:39:17.207
<i>Gwen?</i>

01:39:18.792 --> 01:39:20.169
- <i>Gwen?</i>
- McCaffrey?

01:39:20.169 --> 01:39:21.378
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:23.088
Kid's got the drone.

01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:24.256
Find him.

01:39:25.424 --> 01:39:26.884
Call it off, Dad!

01:39:26.884 --> 01:39:28.427
Hold your fire!

01:39:29.178 --> 01:39:31.096
Change your mind, Sean?

01:39:31.096 --> 01:39:33.557
No. But here's your chance to.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.851
Call it off now.

01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:39.646
You don't have it in you
to kill your own flesh and blood.

01:39:39.646 --> 01:39:42.441
I, on the other hand, do have it in me.

01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:43.817
Let him have it!

01:40:05.797 --> 01:40:08.383
Go. Underneath. Go.

01:40:08.383 --> 01:40:09.384
Wait. No.

01:40:09.384 --> 01:40:11.178
Look after your brothers.
Don't make a sound.

01:40:11.887 --> 01:40:13.555
Do not leave Max, whatever happens.

01:40:30.614 --> 01:40:31.740
Jessica.

01:40:33.492 --> 01:40:35.160
Is that you?

01:40:37.538 --> 01:40:38.997
Talk to me, Kyle.

01:40:38.997 --> 01:40:40.582
<i>Gwen's up here.</i>

01:40:40.582 --> 01:40:43.085
I know the sound of an empty gun
when I hear one, sweetie.

01:40:43.085 --> 01:40:46.505
So why don't we make this real easy,
shall we?

01:40:49.216 --> 01:40:50.843
Unless you think you can take me.

01:40:51.885 --> 01:40:53.846
I think Mom's gonna fight her.

01:41:04.356 --> 01:41:05.524
You think you can beat me

01:41:05.524 --> 01:41:09.236
because you took some kickboxing classes
at the Y and wear Lululemon?

01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:10.696
Ooh, no.

01:41:19.037 --> 01:41:20.205
Learn that in class?

01:41:20.789 --> 01:41:21.790
Yeah.

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:24.126
You know I do this for a living, right?

01:41:24.626 --> 01:41:27.254
While you were popping out brats
and clipping coupons,

01:41:27.254 --> 01:41:29.423
I was assassinating dictators.

01:41:29.423 --> 01:41:32.426
So, why don't you go back to the PTA?

01:41:32.426 --> 01:41:33.927
'Cause you're a joke.

01:41:36.013 --> 01:41:37.181
Kyle, what do you see?

01:41:39.933 --> 01:41:42.436
All right, there's nine guys left.
Four to your right, five ahead of you.

01:42:15.052 --> 01:42:16.678
<i>I'm out of ammo, Kyle.</i>

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.016
Find cover, Dad. A man coming.
Get over the low wall. Now.

01:42:24.645 --> 01:42:26.813
Kyle, could have mentioned
that table, buddy.

01:42:26.813 --> 01:42:27.856
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:42:38.283 --> 01:42:39.910
Take out the one on the left now.

01:42:42.162 --> 01:42:43.956
Dad, hold on. We gotta move.

01:43:01.682 --> 01:43:04.017
<i>Kyle. That guy below,
chase him through the foyer.</i>

01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:05.477
Okay, I'm going. I'm chasing him.

01:43:05.978 --> 01:43:07.187
<i>Keep him coming.</i>

01:43:08.146 --> 01:43:09.439
<i>He's coming right at me.</i>

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.623
Take Max. I gotta go help Mom.

01:43:27.374 --> 01:43:28.417
<i>Talk to me, Kyle.</i>

01:43:29.376 --> 01:43:30.919
<i>Two left, including granddad.</i>

01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:31.962
<i>Man on your right!</i>

01:43:50.105 --> 01:43:52.274
Wouldn't go that way if I were you, Sean.

01:43:52.274 --> 01:43:54.610
Dad, Mom's hurt. We're in big trouble.

01:43:57.696 --> 01:43:58.780
Little brats.

01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:15.756
I was wrong about you, Sean.

01:44:17.341 --> 01:44:18.717
You're no use to me.

01:44:19.801 --> 01:44:21.512
Family have made you weak.

01:44:22.554 --> 01:44:25.933
You can't even focus
on the fight you're in because of them.

01:44:33.148 --> 01:44:35.400
Hi. Going somewhere?

01:44:35.984 --> 01:44:37.611
Don't worry about her. She's great.

01:44:38.904 --> 01:44:41.281
You know, that move
you pulled back there, little one?

01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:43.242
That was a very bad idea.

01:44:46.954 --> 01:44:50.624
Look. For what it's worth, killing minors
is the least favorite part of my job.

01:44:50.624 --> 01:44:52.334
Now, who's first?

01:44:52.334 --> 01:44:54.211
We're not done!

01:44:55.337 --> 01:44:57.464
Mom. No, Mom!

01:45:03.679 --> 01:45:04.847
Bang.

01:45:16.817 --> 01:45:17.860
Mama.

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.736
Oh, come on.

01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:21.196
Just die.

01:45:23.073 --> 01:45:24.283
Mama.

01:45:26.201 --> 01:45:27.202
Mama.

01:45:28.328 --> 01:45:29.329
Mama.

01:45:32.624 --> 01:45:33.709
Look at this.

01:45:36.712 --> 01:45:38.422
You can't be serious.

01:46:12.581 --> 01:46:15.459
Not quite the decathlete
we once were, huh?

01:46:15.459 --> 01:46:17.252
Sorry, kids. It's nothing personal.

01:46:18.253 --> 01:46:19.880
Maybe a little.

01:46:22.549 --> 01:46:23.967
Here we go again.

01:46:25.886 --> 01:46:27.763
She's like <i>The Little Engine That Could.</i>

01:46:35.729 --> 01:46:37.606
There's nine other events, bitch.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.527
Oh, my God. Mom.

01:47:08.136 --> 01:47:11.014
Far as I'm concerned,
this is an act of mercy.

01:47:11.014 --> 01:47:14.977
I'm saving you 20 more years
of selling used cars.

01:47:14.977 --> 01:47:16.353
Certified pre-owned.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.481
Goodbye, Sean.

01:47:20.732 --> 01:47:22.693
Grandpa! Wait!

01:47:24.403 --> 01:47:26.822
I know you think that we probably hate you

01:47:26.822 --> 01:47:29.825
for everything that's happened
these past few days, and--

01:47:29.825 --> 01:47:31.034
and maybe we should.

01:47:32.244 --> 01:47:36.915
But I've learned that family is the most
important thing in the entire world.

01:47:38.417 --> 01:47:42.713
And when I look at you,
I don't just see a cold-blooded killer.

01:47:43.714 --> 01:47:44.840
I see my grandpa.

01:47:52.139 --> 01:47:54.683
And maybe there's a way
for us to move forward...

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.270
as a family.

01:47:59.938 --> 01:48:03.692
Kid, if you think this little speech
is gonna win me over...

01:48:05.277 --> 01:48:06.278
Honestly...

01:48:08.739 --> 01:48:11.200
I was just hoping
it would buy him enough time to do this.

01:48:17.497 --> 01:48:18.749
Oh, baby.

01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:21.043
- Dad.
- Hey.

01:48:22.878 --> 01:48:23.921
Thank you.

01:48:23.921 --> 01:48:25.422
Hi!

01:48:26.048 --> 01:48:28.133
Wow!

01:48:51.406 --> 01:48:53.617
<i>Good afternoon,
and welcome to the news at noon.</i>

01:48:53.617 --> 01:48:57.454
<i>While details are continuing to emerge
about a covert paramilitary group...</i>

01:48:57.454 --> 01:48:58.497
Thanks.

01:48:58.497 --> 01:49:00.165
<i>...responsible
for high-profile assassinations</i>

01:49:00.165 --> 01:49:02.000
<i>reportedly spanning decades,</i>

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.461
<i>this bombshell story was broken</i>

01:49:04.461 --> 01:49:08.090
<i>by a high school newspaper reporter,
Nina Morgan.</i>

01:49:15.639 --> 01:49:17.099
And you're dead.

01:49:17.099 --> 01:49:19.268
That's bullshit.
You said there'd be two hostiles.

01:49:19.268 --> 01:49:21.979
I lied. But, Sam, that was better.
Take him down harder.

01:49:21.979 --> 01:49:23.063
I didn't wanna hurt the guy.

01:49:23.063 --> 01:49:25.566
No, he'll be fine.
He's small, but he's very strong.

01:49:25.566 --> 01:49:28.944
Hey, excuse me. Why don't you
get thrown against a truck 20 times?

01:49:28.944 --> 01:49:30.654
Because my name's on the letterhead.

01:49:30.654 --> 01:49:31.572
<i>Et voilà!</i>

01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:33.574
Hey, guys. I have a family commitment.

01:49:34.074 --> 01:49:36.076
Augie, you take it from here, okay?

01:49:38.203 --> 01:49:39.663
Let's pick up the pace!

01:49:40.205 --> 01:49:42.082
I'm gonna be gone for the next few days!

01:49:42.082 --> 01:49:44.001
I want you to remember me!

01:49:59.349 --> 01:50:00.350
Hey, it's time to go.

01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:02.186
Okay, people. I'm out.

01:50:03.187 --> 01:50:04.354
Guys, come on.

01:50:04.354 --> 01:50:06.190
We gotta beat the traffic!

01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.441
Oh, come on.

01:50:07.441 --> 01:50:09.776
No, I cannot show up to school
in this monstrosity.

01:50:09.776 --> 01:50:11.570
- How could you do this to me?
- Don't blame me.

01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:14.489
Levon applied all the discounts
and all the points. Didn't you hear?

01:50:14.489 --> 01:50:16.950
We are platinum elite
superior diamond members.

01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:18.994
Okay. I got the snacks. I got the maps.

01:50:18.994 --> 01:50:20.370
- Let's do this.
- Nice.

01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:22.497
- Hey, phones, please.
- For real?

01:50:22.497 --> 01:50:24.124
Yeah. Catch it.

01:50:24.124 --> 01:50:25.334
There you go.

01:50:25.334 --> 01:50:28.045
- Thank you.
- If you throw this away, I will kill you.

01:50:28.045 --> 01:50:28.962
- God, gross.
- Oh, gross.

01:50:28.962 --> 01:50:30.506
You gonna be doing that
all the way to California?

01:50:30.506 --> 01:50:31.840
- Yes. All the way.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.966

01:50:32.966 --> 01:50:35.135
- I'm going. Here, scooch.
- And I will take those.

01:50:35.135 --> 01:50:36.637
- Beep, beep.
- Here we go.

01:50:38.805 --> 01:50:41.350
One, two, three!

01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:44.102
Road trip!

01:52:15.402 --> 01:52:17.029
Oh, my God. Guys, I almost forgot.

01:52:17.029 --> 01:52:18.113
What? Yeah?

01:52:18.113 --> 01:52:20.908
- Say goodbye to these.
- No!

01:52:24.745 --> 01:52:25.746
Why?

01:52:27.915 --> 01:52:29.041
Oh, my God.

01:52:29.041 --> 01:52:30.042
That's not funny.

01:53:03.659 --> 01:53:07.913

Man or woman to pump me up</i>
