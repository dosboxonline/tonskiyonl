00:12.095 --> 00:14.515
<i>Good morning, Garden City.</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:18.185
<i>This is J.R. Bonner playing you
all country all the time.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:22.981
<i>And now here's a snazzy golden oldie
guaranteed to get that old ticker pumping.</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:25.943
<i>"That's All It Took" by Gram Parsons.</i>

00:31.740 --> 00:32.824
Morning, hon.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.618
Sleep all right?

00:35.285 --> 00:36.286
Fine. You?

00:37.829 --> 00:40.541
Was up all night. This damn hip again.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.938
- Morning, Sergei.
- Morning, Cliff.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.316
Got brownies today.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.151
Good stuff.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.778
You're a lucky man, Cliff.

01:56.533 --> 02:00.871
So here we have a 3D diagram
of an electrical field.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.290
So, who can tell me what is voltage?

02:07.628 --> 02:08.669
Harry?

02:17.930 --> 02:21.892
Voltage is the potential difference
between two points in an electrical field.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.481
<i>That was sweet.
Look what somebody did for me.</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:31.109
- <i>It's crooked on this side though.</i>
- What do they call this flavor?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.029
Peanut butter swirl.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.113
You like it?

02:35.739 --> 02:36.740
Yeah.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.450
Very good.

02:38.450 --> 02:42.454
<i>Thanks. Maybe on Overrated Photographer's
Day, I'll buy you a shammy for your head.</i>

02:51.046 --> 02:54.466
<i>I made the decision to defect...</i>

02:55.676 --> 02:58.929
<i>to the Soviet Union in 1995,</i>

03:00.138 --> 03:06.019
<i>after many years
of dissatisfaction and disappointment</i>

03:06.895 --> 03:09.731
<i>with both NASA
and the American government.</i>

03:11.441 --> 03:16.655
<i>The space program I joined in 1966 had
changed over the years</i>

03:16.655 --> 03:22.995
<i>to value profit above human life, and was
more dedicated to spreading propaganda...</i>

03:22.995 --> 03:25.038
Isn't this the wildest thing?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.917
They thought she died in that bombing
years ago.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.545
The one in Houston. Remember?

03:32.254 --> 03:35.090
<i>I have kept my silence
for the past eight years...</i>

03:35.090 --> 03:39.511
- Yes, yes. I do.
- <i>...in order to not distract</i>

03:39.511 --> 03:42.264
<i>from the historic work that Roscos...</i>

04:44.368 --> 04:45.410
Mr. Bezukhov?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.081
Mr. Bezukhov?

04:55.170 --> 04:59.216
So, as you can see,
the current is not always constant.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.010
<i>Police held back a mass of protesters</i>

05:02.010 --> 05:05.097
<i>so that Madison's car was able
to enter the campus.</i>

05:05.097 --> 05:07.850
<i>Despite the cries from some
to have Madison arrested,</i>

05:07.850 --> 05:11.395
<i>NASA Administrator Eli Hobson issued
a statement that</i>

05:11.395 --> 05:15.399
<i>he considers Madison a key player
in the M-7's efforts</i>

05:15.399 --> 05:17.401
<i>to capture the Goldilocks asteroid.</i>

07:36.498 --> 07:37.833
Italian Roast.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.133
Hey, thanks for taking the time.

07:50.596 --> 07:51.889
Yeah. Yeah, look.

07:52.556 --> 07:57.144
Whatever this is about, Ed,
I appreciate that you stood your ground.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.104
You didn't cross the line
like the rest of them.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.524
But when you come to me and you say
you and Dev Ayesa wanna talk,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.902
I start to wonder how committed you were
to our cause.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.280
The reason doesn't matter. Mars matters.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.073
And this fight isn't over.

08:10.073 --> 08:14.161
Seems to me like the people have spoken
and they told us to take a hike.

08:14.161 --> 08:18.790
Sometimes it's up to a few enlightened
individuals that lead the many.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.083
Enlightened, huh?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.587
We can both agree on that
Dev's a fucking asshole.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.838
There's no way around it.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.926
But he's brilliant.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.138
Just hear what we have to say.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.933
Can I help you?

08:35.933 --> 08:39.186
This establishment is hereby shut down
by order of the base commander

08:39.186 --> 08:41.395
for contravening the M-7 charter.

08:41.395 --> 08:45.150
Ordinance 3.57,
prohibiting the sale of contraband.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.401
Geez, Palmer.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.738
- Everyone was having such a good time.
- All right, move it out.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.533
This is totally out of line.
You're a sad little man

08:52.533 --> 08:54.409
trying to squeeze authority
out of bullshit.

08:54.409 --> 08:58.747
Please submit a formal written complaint
to your direct supervisor, worm.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.582
Jesus. I know
they took the strike personal.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.669
But this whole security detail thing,
it's-- It's overkill.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.337
It's bullshit is what it is.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.465
- Who's your reporting officer?
- You can't go anywhere

09:08.465 --> 09:11.385
without somebody checking your ID badge,
asking what you're up to.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.095
It's a scare tactic. Pure and simple.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.639
Trying to keep us in check.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.433
Which is why I'm telling you
you've got to hear him out.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.060
I don't know.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.730
What the hell is that?

09:27.568 --> 09:29.570
Hey! What's going on in here?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.198
Hey, Sam.

09:33.699 --> 09:37.619
Orders from on high. They're sealing off
access to sub-levels four and five.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.246
"Crew safety."

09:39.246 --> 09:43.208
Yeah. More like they're afraid us peasant
folk will find another place to organize.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.293
You said it.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.753
Even got us hard-wiring lockouts
on the elevators.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.965
Seems like our noble commander is learning
from her partners

09:49.965 --> 09:52.718
and taking a page
out of that Soviet playbook.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.678
When in doubt, you crack down.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.389
You guys can go up in this one.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.473
Thanks, Sparks.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.483
All right. I'll hear what you have to say.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.449
How did Massey take it?

10:17.159 --> 10:18.285
Skeptical.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.205
But wouldn't you be?

10:21.205 --> 10:23.165
Yeah, but she's the key
to this whole thing.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.667
None of the others will go along with it
if she says no.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.961
At some point,
we have to get on the same page about--

10:29.671 --> 10:30.672
The hell?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.010
- Kel.
- Dev!

10:35.010 --> 10:37.095
I've been practicing that new magic trick.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.180
All right.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.391
Kel, what's--

10:42.100 --> 10:43.936
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

10:43.936 --> 10:45.270
Tell me you didn't forget.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.564
No, of course not.

10:48.774 --> 10:52.319
I'm taking a hopper to Korolev Crater
to get my seekers up and running.

10:52.319 --> 10:56.698
I told you I'll be gone for three days
and you said you'd watch Alex.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.408
Yeah, of course.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.163
All right, kiddo. Give me a hug.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.085
- I love you.
- Love you.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.631
You'll have all kinds of fun
with your grandpa while I'm gone.

11:15.926 --> 11:20.722
This is his medication. And the schedule.
And a list of our family rules.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.267
Jesus, Kel.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.476
No crust.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.063
This is crazy. I mean, no wonder
the kid's afraid of his own shadow.

11:29.064 --> 11:33.235
Really? You're going to chime in
on parenting techniques at this point?

11:33.235 --> 11:35.237
You've never watched Alex before.

11:35.237 --> 11:39.199
Hey. I raised two kids.
Including you, remember?

11:39.199 --> 11:42.703
- Alex is different.
- Yeah. Well, then maybe you should

11:42.703 --> 11:44.788
you know, maybe take him with you.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.124
A methane hunt is full
of drills and dynamite.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.001
It's no place for a seven-year-old, okay?

11:49.001 --> 11:51.753
And you don't have much else
going on here anyway.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.047
So I'm throwing you into the deep end.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.883
Sink or swim, remember?

11:55.883 --> 11:58.051
That was terrible advice.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.513
But okay. Let's do it.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.100
Dev, I will contact you
when I get to Korolev Crater.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.102
Good hunting.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.271
Hey, Mom.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.024
You'll come back, right?

12:12.024 --> 12:14.026
Of course I will.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.863
Three days. Have fun.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.531
All right.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.161
We're gonna need a babysitter.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.663
Yep.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.055
Gentlemen.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.099
Come in.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.522
Got one of each, huh?

12:53.357 --> 12:54.358
Lucky me.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.403
I wanted to see how you're settling in.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.280
Fine.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.158
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.577
Well, we're gonna be getting started soon.

13:05.577 --> 13:09.540
I thought I might
show you to the conference room.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.941
- ...the cat dragged in.
- Moscow Margo, huh?

13:39.903 --> 13:41.196
Nuri! My God.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.116
It's good to see you.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.118
Hello.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.036
I--

13:49.121 --> 13:50.831
I heard you were project manager.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.457
Congratulations.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.668
Yep.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.754
If you'll excuse me, I'm running late.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.221
She's very busy.

14:06.972 --> 14:07.973
Shall we?

14:12.436 --> 14:15.689
We're at a crossroads, people.
So I won't mince words.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.400
This asteroid is far too vital
to our countries

14:18.400 --> 14:21.236
to let another screw-up
like that strike happen again.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.531
Security will be airtight
from here on out.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.743
I have asked
the Soviet Union's chief project engineer

14:27.743 --> 14:33.457
for the 2003LC Capture Mission,
Margo Madison, to brief us on the plan.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.459
Miss Madison.

14:35.459 --> 14:39.379
I know we've had our differences
but I appreciate you all for coming.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.257
If Sam hadn't twisted my arm,
I wouldn't be here.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.761
Ditto. I sincerely hope
this isn't for some fucked up game

14:45.761 --> 14:48.096
like the one you played
to trash our strike.

14:48.096 --> 14:52.184
That was an unfortunate
and difficult development for all of us.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.644
But a necessary one.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.229
That strike had to end

14:55.229 --> 14:58.398
if we were to keep with the required
timeline to capture the asteroid.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.985
But the four of you showed
that you have principle,

15:03.153 --> 15:06.532
courage and that you won't fold
under pressure.

15:06.532 --> 15:08.909
Stop blowing smoke and speak normal, dude.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.661
- Come on.
- All right.

15:10.661 --> 15:13.372
I'm gonna ask you to do something that's
never been done

15:13.372 --> 15:15.123
by anyone in human history.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.086
For the benefit of Mars, for human
space exploration and for yourselves,

15:19.086 --> 15:22.673
because it just might make those bastards
on Earth finally take notice.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.759
What do you want us to do?

15:29.137 --> 15:34.059
<i>Ranger's</i> engines can only effect small
changes to the asteroid's trajectory.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.395
Just enough to bring it

15:38.146 --> 15:39.231
near Mars.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.694
Once it is there, <i>Ranger</i> will again burn...

15:43.694 --> 15:45.863
...for exactly 20 minutes.

15:45.863 --> 15:49.032
When the time comes,
we will slow the asteroid down.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.119
Just enough for the gravity of Mars
to bend its trajectory

15:52.119 --> 15:53.787
to speed it towards Earth.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.915
Unless <i>Ranger</i> burns for 25 minutes
instead of 20.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.459
That will slow the asteroid down even more

15:59.459 --> 16:02.129
and allow it to be fully captured
by Mars's gravity

16:02.129 --> 16:03.922
instead of merely changing its direction.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.967
And bring it into permanent orbit
around the Red Planet.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.178
Where it belongs.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.513
But how the fuck does that happen?

16:12.014 --> 16:15.601
Happy Valley doesn't have
anywhere near the computing power

16:15.601 --> 16:17.144
of NASA or Roscosmos.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.521
So we'll work out that burn command
down here.

16:20.105 --> 16:25.611
NASA will uplink the data to Ops-Com
at Happy Valley. They will then relay it...

16:25.611 --> 16:29.114
...with our secure comm system
using our high-gain S-band antenna.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.577
<i>Ranger</i> will pick up the signal, confirm
its validity with this discriminator box

16:33.577 --> 16:35.287
to make sure that it came from us.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.123
We'd have to hack into the Comsat.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.127
Or maybe physically take control
of the satellite dish array.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.421
Even if that were possible,

16:44.421 --> 16:47.674
we still need Ops-Com to let us know
when <i>Ranger</i> reaches her burn point.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.884
Unless we build our own.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.385
Our own what?

16:50.385 --> 16:51.929
Our own Ops-Com.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.805
So we can send our own signal.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.390
If the discriminator gives it a go,

16:55.390 --> 16:57.851
it'll forward the command
to the engine control system,

16:57.851 --> 16:59.895
and <i>Ranger</i> will initiate the burn
for Earth.

17:01.772 --> 17:04.358
The only way we can extend
the burn is by getting control

17:04.358 --> 17:06.818
of the discriminator box on the <i>Ranger</i>.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.903
She's right.

17:07.903 --> 17:10.739
If the incoming signal doesn't have
the right authentication packet,

17:10.739 --> 17:12.699
<i>Ranger's</i> comm system
won't even look at it.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.827
So the key to this whole thing is
that discriminator box.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.997
Finally, when <i>Ranger</i> launches
in two days we're gonna need someone

17:18.997 --> 17:21.208
on their crew to swap it out for our own.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.377
An inside man.

17:25.337 --> 17:26.338
Or woman.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.886
Sam, when the time comes, you swap out
that discriminator for our carbon copy.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.930
Okay. Let me get this straight.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.058
You want me to just swap out
a mission-critical component

17:38.058 --> 17:40.894
in the middle of the ship,
surrounded by the crew.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.982
- Sure. No biggie.
- If we're to pull this off,

17:44.982 --> 17:47.317
we're gonna have to do things
we're not comfortable doing.

17:47.317 --> 17:51.655
Even if I could, they're not gonna let me
back on that crew. Not after the strike.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.574
Never say never.

17:55.617 --> 17:56.618
She's gone.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.288
Hold on. I'd rethink that.

17:59.997 --> 18:03.458
Sir, that's Sam Massey. She's one
of the leaders of the work stoppage.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.961
I'm aware of who she is.
And I'm sure you're aware that

18:05.961 --> 18:09.423
if I were to discipline, demote
or penalize in any way a labor organizer,

18:09.423 --> 18:12.509
I'd open myself up to massive lawsuits
and a PR nightmare back on Earth.

18:14.553 --> 18:15.637
No. I still don't--

18:15.637 --> 18:18.182
Ravi. What do you think?

18:18.182 --> 18:20.684
You're in command of <i>Ranger</i>,
it's your crew.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.272
Massey was on Kronos.
We could use her experience.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.859
If she can park her attitude.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.238
All right.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.032
Let's keep her on.

18:35.908 --> 18:40.537
Massey's heart was in the right place.
And if anything, it'll be an olive branch.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.502
But I want you to go up there with them.
Keep an eye on things.

18:47.586 --> 18:48.587
Aye, aye.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.052
Well, we need a crackerjack engineer
to build out our control room.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.428
Rich might do it.

18:56.428 --> 19:00.098
And we're gonna need an electrician
to pull power into our Ops-Com.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.143
- Edmondson's the best there is.
- Sparks? Will she do it?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.812
- I can ask.
- Right. First things first.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.439
If we're gonna build our own Ops,

19:08.482 --> 19:10.150
we need the right equipment.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.027
Consoles, processors, servers,
comm relays--

19:12.027 --> 19:16.198
NASA's redundant to a fault. I mean,
every piece of equipment has a backup.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.951
But they're all stored up on <i>Phoenix</i>
under lock and key.

19:18.951 --> 19:21.286
We need a way to get all that
down here undetected.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.706
I think I know the guy.

19:25.499 --> 19:26.708
Okay, good.

19:27.626 --> 19:28.961
So are we doing this?

19:53.694 --> 19:54.987
That went well.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.197
I think so.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.202
Eli has an interesting sense of humor.

20:03.996 --> 20:04.997
He means well.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.586
How's your family?

20:10.586 --> 20:14.464
How's Javier? Is he still playing
the piano? Last time I saw--

20:14.464 --> 20:17.342
Let's get something straight.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.055
When it comes to the work,

20:22.055 --> 20:24.266
I will support you
when I think you're right.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.768
And I will disagree with you
when I think you're wrong.

20:28.145 --> 20:31.064
But you don't get to ask me
about my family or my son again.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.442
Understand?

20:53.712 --> 20:55.255
Alex, it's Poppy.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.758
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

20:57.758 --> 21:01.345
Wonderful. We've been having
great fun together.

21:01.345 --> 21:04.765
He helped me prune my blueberry plants
and my kumquats.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.559
Well, Joanna. I can't thank you enough.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.438
Alex. Come on. It's time to go.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.234
- Where is he?
- He's right back here.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.322
He was a moment ago.

21:22.491 --> 21:23.492
Alex.

21:24.993 --> 21:25.994
Alex.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.415
All right.
You go that way. I'll go this way.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.085
Alex.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.295
Alex.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.298
Alex?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.383
Alex.

21:39.967 --> 21:40.968
Alex!

21:46.139 --> 21:47.850
This is Ed Baldwin. I'm looking for--

21:47.850 --> 21:48.934
Got him!

21:52.062 --> 21:54.857
Alex! You can't--
You can't just run off like that.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.108
What were you thinking?

21:57.192 --> 21:58.235
Where'd you go?

21:58.861 --> 22:00.571
I was looking for you.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.072
You what?

22:03.532 --> 22:05.284
I was looking for you.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.498
Hey.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.458
Hey. Hey.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.752
All right. It's okay.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.505
It's okay.

22:20.966 --> 22:21.967
Hey.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.054
Come on.

22:28.015 --> 22:29.600
<i>...that which you've been...</i>

22:45.240 --> 22:46.283
Coming.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.580
- Right in here.
- Very good, ma'am.

23:47.845 --> 23:50.556
I don't know.
Look, to get this stuff off of <i>Phoenix</i>,

23:50.556 --> 23:53.517
not only do I have to get in
on a cargo module undetected,

23:53.517 --> 23:57.062
I gotta get it past Madam Mussolini's
new security measures down here.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.233
What? Are you telling me you can't do it,
or you won't?

24:01.233 --> 24:05.279
My guy can get it off <i>Phoenix</i>. But getting
it out of the loading dock down here,

24:05.279 --> 24:08.615
there's the problem.
See all this shit's flagged high-security.

24:08.615 --> 24:12.202
So if it turns up in the dock,
they're gonna put it in secure lockup.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.288
Where I got no access. No one does.

24:15.706 --> 24:17.332
I mean, maybe there's a way around that.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.918
But I don't know.

24:20.419 --> 24:23.755
It seems dicey. What I got going on
right now, you know, it's low-risk.

24:24.256 --> 24:26.133
I don't have that long left on my tour.

24:26.133 --> 24:28.552
So when I get back Earthside,
I'm gonna be with my family,

24:28.552 --> 24:30.053
sitting on a nice little nest egg.

24:31.096 --> 24:34.933
You are thinking so small, Dale. You know,
my former partner, he thought small.

24:34.933 --> 24:37.394
Was always worried we'd lose
what we built up.

24:37.394 --> 24:40.105
So he was on the defense.
Just like you're doing right now.

24:40.105 --> 24:43.817
And if I let him make all the decisions,
we'd still be working out of our garage.

24:43.817 --> 24:47.654
But we went from having
a few thousand dollars to our name.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.073
Now I'm worth billions.

24:52.826 --> 24:59.249
So, I ask you, Miles, do you wanna be
a millionaire or a billionaire?

25:03.587 --> 25:06.340
- Billionaire, huh?
- I had to break through to him somehow.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.218
Yeah, better go get Alex from Joanna.

25:10.469 --> 25:13.639
He is a good kid. He's so smart.

25:13.639 --> 25:14.723
Yeah.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.353
Hey, you two seem
to get along pretty well.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.813
We haven't really clicked yet.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.234
It'll come. You know, my dad and I,
we had our moments.

25:25.901 --> 25:27.319
He was an engineer, right?

25:27.319 --> 25:29.071
Yeah. He loved to build things.

25:29.071 --> 25:31.281
He had all these models.
Put them all over the den.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.868
I'm a model freak too. It's very calming.

25:34.868 --> 25:39.373
You know, he had this one of a <i>Gemini</i>
spacecraft sitting atop a <i>Titan II</i> rocket.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.124
And I knew it was his favorite.

25:41.124 --> 25:44.419
So when he was gone,
I would take it down off the shelf,

25:44.419 --> 25:46.630
play with it when he wasn't around.

25:47.506 --> 25:48.674
But one day,

25:50.175 --> 25:51.718
- I broke it.
- Uh-oh.

25:52.302 --> 25:54.972
- He peeled the bark off me for that.
- I bet he did.

25:55.973 --> 25:58.392
But then he went out
and he bought a new model kit.

25:58.892 --> 26:01.520
And he made me rebuild it piece by piece,

26:01.520 --> 26:03.647
while he looked over my shoulder
and instructed me.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.067
And I felt

26:08.151 --> 26:10.112
so close to him that day.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.782
- That's nice.
- And when we were done,

26:13.782 --> 26:16.869
that was the first time that he told me
about the birds that fly backwards.

26:18.287 --> 26:19.288
The what?

26:19.288 --> 26:22.207
Every winter you see whole flocks of them
flying north for the winter.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.919
- Do you know why they fly backwards?
- Not a clue.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.255
Because they want to see
where they've been,

26:28.255 --> 26:30.340
because that's how they know
where they're going.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.762
I like that.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.350
You know, someday,
young Alex is gonna look back at you

26:40.350 --> 26:42.269
the same way that I look back at my dad.

26:42.769 --> 26:43.896
So just be yourself.

26:45.355 --> 26:46.440
Share your passion.

26:48.192 --> 26:49.818
That's the greatest gift I ever got.

27:16.637 --> 27:17.721
Hello, Miss Rosales.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.269
Perhaps you don't remember me. I'm--

27:24.269 --> 27:25.437
No, I remember you.

27:26.271 --> 27:28.315
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, but...

27:28.941 --> 27:30.609
I'm sorry for startling you, but...

27:33.362 --> 27:34.571
You shouldn't be here.

27:34.571 --> 27:35.656
Please.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.284
Please, just give me a minute.

27:41.245 --> 27:43.372
You're the only person
who might understand.

27:49.461 --> 27:52.130
I begged her for that engine design,

27:53.674 --> 27:56.885
but she would not help me,
no matter how much I pleaded with her.

27:58.387 --> 28:02.057
There was no way we were going
to be able to launch at '94 without it.

28:04.101 --> 28:07.896
I was told by the KGB

28:07.896 --> 28:14.152
to go to her at the IAC conference to do
whatever I had to to get the design...

28:16.864 --> 28:18.365
but I refused.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.705
So my handler sent two men into her room.

28:24.705 --> 28:30.586
They threatened to report Margo to the FBI
unless she cooperated.

28:31.336 --> 28:34.298
And still, she would not give them
the engine design.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.758
So,

28:38.427 --> 28:41.430
that is when they began to strangle me
in front of her.

28:45.434 --> 28:46.435
Jesus.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.606
Margo didn't tell you about this?

28:56.904 --> 28:57.988
She--

28:58.572 --> 29:02.492
She sacrificed everything
along with her honor to save my life.

29:07.706 --> 29:09.208
For eight years...

29:12.211 --> 29:14.087
she let us think she was dead.

29:16.423 --> 29:19.510
For eight fucking years
she never tried to reach out

29:19.510 --> 29:21.553
- to tell us that she was okay...
- How--

29:21.553 --> 29:23.639
- ...that she was alive.
- How could she?

29:27.976 --> 29:32.064
A defector in the Soviet Union is
a glorified prisoner. A bird in a cage.

29:32.064 --> 29:34.274
I know. I know...

29:37.486 --> 29:38.487
I just...

29:43.492 --> 29:46.954
I don't know how to forgive her.

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
I understand.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.970
But where would you be today without her?

30:05.848 --> 30:07.015
Think about this.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.353
She believed in you, Aleida.

30:12.855 --> 30:14.398
Just as she did me.

30:16.483 --> 30:19.069
Please. Please.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.363
Help me to speak with her.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.819
- Poppy?
- Yeah, I thought you were asleep.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.656
I'm scared.

31:04.656 --> 31:05.741
You're scared?

31:06.909 --> 31:09.328
There's nothing to be scared of.
You're safe in here.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.498
Hey, what are you scared of?

31:19.171 --> 31:21.215
You're not afraid of me, are you?

31:26.178 --> 31:27.179
Hey...

31:28.931 --> 31:30.682
I love you, kiddo.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.769
But you-you look like a bear.

31:35.979 --> 31:38.524
I-- I look like a bear?

31:42.194 --> 31:43.946
Maybe I do.

32:02.422 --> 32:06.051
You know, when your mom was your age,
she was afraid of the dark too.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.971
You know what I used to do for her?

32:08.971 --> 32:10.097
What?

32:10.722 --> 32:12.349
I used to read her a story.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.144
Would you like me to read you a story?

32:28.699 --> 32:31.076
So this is a story about a sailor.

32:31.952 --> 32:35.372
But in a strange land far, far from home.

32:36.832 --> 32:38.584
His name is Jake Holman.

32:44.965 --> 32:45.966
"Chapter one.

32:47.009 --> 32:49.803
'Hello, ship,'
Jake Holman said under his breath.

32:50.429 --> 32:51.555
The ship was asleep.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.390
Didn't hear him.

32:54.057 --> 32:57.144
He lowered his big, canvas,
30-year bag to the ground

32:57.144 --> 33:00.689
and stood there in the moon shadow
of a brick wall

33:00.689 --> 33:03.066
and had his first long look at her.

33:04.401 --> 33:07.112
She looked stubby and blocky,

33:07.112 --> 33:10.449
top-heavy down there at the edge
of the black, rolling river,

33:10.449 --> 33:13.202
and she was all mountain.

33:13.202 --> 33:17.039
Moon-white except
for her slender black smokestack,

33:17.039 --> 33:20.626
<i>that rose very high,
high as her two masts.</i>

33:21.543 --> 33:26.840
<i>Four guy-wires slanted down from the stack
like streamers from the maypole.</i>

33:26.840 --> 33:29.635
<i>She had a stubby, shielded gun
on her open bound</i>

33:29.635 --> 33:33.722
<i>and a double, man-high hand steering wheel
on her open fantail aft.</i>

33:34.681 --> 33:37.768
<i>But in between,
she looked more like a house than a ship.</i>

33:37.768 --> 33:40.687
<i>Her square, curtain windows
and screen doors</i>

33:40.687 --> 33:44.566
<i>opened on a gallery main deck
like a long, narrow veranda.</i>

33:45.275 --> 33:49.530
<i>And on the pipe rail boat deck,
under taut, white awnings.</i>

33:49.530 --> 33:51.240
<i>It was after midnight.</i>

33:51.240 --> 33:54.117
<i>They were asleep down there,
all but the watch."</i>

36:17.177 --> 36:19.555
You're welcome to have a seat.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.445
They told me you'd be up here.

36:38.657 --> 36:39.992
Chairs are different.

36:53.547 --> 36:54.673
What you got?

36:59.803 --> 37:00.804
It's...

37:02.514 --> 37:04.850
updated state vectors
from our tracking stations.

37:07.186 --> 37:09.438
Seems there's some variation
from our predicted path

37:09.438 --> 37:11.481
and what the network is seeing.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.362
Let me take a look.

37:32.002 --> 37:37.925
I'll go over these figures tonight
and let you know what I think.

37:39.301 --> 37:40.302
Thanks.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.031
<i>All right,
let's go over this plan one more time.</i>

38:01.031 --> 38:02.658
<i>After what happened at the fuel plant,</i>

38:02.658 --> 38:06.119
<i>you all know they've got these goddamn
security checkpoints all over the base,</i>

38:06.119 --> 38:08.455
<i>including the loading dock.</i>

38:08.455 --> 38:12.292
<i>And nothing or no one goes in
or out of that room without a once-over.</i>

38:12.292 --> 38:15.337
<i>So we can't just waltz in
and grab all this stuff off the shelves,</i>

38:15.337 --> 38:18.048
<i>we got to be a little
more clever about it.</i>

38:18.048 --> 38:21.468
<i>So we're gonna forge a requisition
for everything we need on our list.</i>

38:21.468 --> 38:22.886
<i>My guy on</i> Phoenix <i>cargo haul</i>

38:22.886 --> 38:26.181
<i>is gonna swap the package in for something
a little more inconspicuous.</i>

38:27.099 --> 38:28.100
<i>All the electronics we need,</i>

38:28.100 --> 38:30.602
<i>they'll be inside the containers
labeled cereal, cotton rounds</i>

38:30.602 --> 38:32.104
<i>and dehydrated milk.</i>

38:32.104 --> 38:35.357
<i>Each one of ours will have a green
and yellow bar code.</i>

38:36.900 --> 38:40.070
<i>The security assholes,
they're all former military.</i>

38:40.571 --> 38:42.656
<i>So stay alert and stick to the plan.</i>

38:49.454 --> 38:50.455
Hold up.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.501
Req form, please.

39:12.227 --> 39:14.146
Gonna need you to open up this box.

39:39.630 --> 39:42.132
I don't know if I could've held my cool
like that, Miles.

39:42.132 --> 39:44.718
- <i>Tienes huevos, cabrón.</i>
- Thanks, man.

39:44.718 --> 39:47.763
Ilya always said, "Cover your bases."

40:11.495 --> 40:13.497
All right. Looks like Christmas in here.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.541
Welcome to Ops-Com 2, gentlemen.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.376
I prefer "Ghost Ops".

40:17.376 --> 40:18.836
Sounds way cooler.

40:18.836 --> 40:20.629
What? Where's it at?

40:23.382 --> 40:24.758
What the hell?

40:25.843 --> 40:27.678
Man, come on.

40:27.678 --> 40:29.972
It's supposed to be here. Wha--

40:32.683 --> 40:35.310
I'm guessing it's supposed to be
more than just cornflakes in there.

40:38.146 --> 40:39.523
What was supposed to be in there?

40:40.691 --> 40:41.692
Discriminator.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.322
- Fuck.
- Okay.

40:47.322 --> 40:49.324
So, if it's not there, then where is it?

41:00.836 --> 41:03.046
It's here,
but it got sent to the secure lockup.

41:04.548 --> 41:06.550
My guy on <i>Phoenix</i> must
have screwed up the boxes.

41:06.550 --> 41:09.595
Yeah. Fortunately,
it just looks like a shipping error.

41:10.429 --> 41:13.891
Can we get to it somehow?
Maybe bust the lock or something?

41:13.891 --> 41:15.726
No, it's electronic. It's gnarly as hell.

41:15.726 --> 41:18.228
There's no way we could get through that.

41:18.228 --> 41:19.771
There might be one other way, but--

41:19.771 --> 41:21.857
No, it's too small.

41:21.857 --> 41:23.025
What's too small?

41:23.025 --> 41:24.193
Intake vent.

41:24.193 --> 41:27.654
It's 12 inches across.
None of us are going to fit through it.

41:46.048 --> 41:47.883
Listen. Hey.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.346
It's okay if you don't wanna do this.

41:53.472 --> 41:55.641
It's okay. I want to.

41:56.183 --> 41:57.184
You sure?

41:58.727 --> 41:59.728
You sure, sure?

42:04.399 --> 42:05.400
Okay.

42:25.587 --> 42:26.964
He's gonna be okay.

42:34.304 --> 42:35.848
You see the plate, Alex?

42:36.515 --> 42:38.642
It's kinda dark.

42:43.522 --> 42:44.731
This is stupid.

42:48.443 --> 42:50.112
I'm in the room!

42:50.112 --> 42:52.906
Okay. Okay, buddy.

42:52.906 --> 42:56.451
Now look around
and see if you can see that box.

42:57.077 --> 42:58.704
Okay--

43:00.247 --> 43:02.040
What is it?

43:02.040 --> 43:05.794
There's a shelf
and the box is on the top of it.

43:06.503 --> 43:08.172
Okay-- Can you reach it?

43:08.172 --> 43:09.590
No.

43:12.593 --> 43:13.594
Shit.

43:14.386 --> 43:16.805
All right. Just come on back out here.

43:16.805 --> 43:18.807
We'll find another way to get it.

43:18.807 --> 43:21.351
I think I can reach if I climb a bit.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.606
Okay, but be careful now, Alex.

43:25.606 --> 43:26.899
That could be tricky--

43:28.358 --> 43:29.359
Alex?

43:30.652 --> 43:32.196
Alex, you okay?

43:46.168 --> 43:47.753
All right.

43:47.753 --> 43:49.171
Look at that.

43:52.549 --> 43:54.927
- There he is.
- Hey, little man.

43:56.553 --> 43:57.763
Look at you.

43:57.763 --> 43:58.847
Hey--

43:59.473 --> 44:01.892
You are a brave boy. You know that?

44:01.892 --> 44:03.477
You're a brave boy.

44:04.478 --> 44:08.607
You scored big, little man.

44:08.607 --> 44:12.152
Yes, you did.

45:55.297 --> 45:57.299
Closing time. Gotta give you the boot.

45:58.967 --> 46:01.053
Okay, thanks. Thank you.

46:02.596 --> 46:04.431
Sorry about your friend.

46:05.557 --> 46:08.977
If you're in town tomorrow,
stop in for our early bird special.

46:09.895 --> 46:11.188
Okay.

47:17.212 --> 47:18.380
Sergei.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.263
Margo.

47:37.191 --> 47:38.192
I'm--

47:39.401 --> 47:41.278
I'm glad you came.

47:41.278 --> 47:43.405
- I--
- This can't happen, Sergei.

47:44.323 --> 47:47.117
You have a life here now,
and I have a life over there.

47:47.117 --> 47:48.410
No, no, no, no, no.

47:48.410 --> 47:49.912
You don't understand.

47:49.912 --> 47:52.456
It was difficult for some time,
but I'm finally starting to--

47:52.456 --> 47:54.791
You are not safe, Margo.

47:58.128 --> 48:03.258
The woman you know as Irina Morozova,
the head of Roscosmos,

48:04.593 --> 48:06.428
she was my handler with KGB.

48:07.304 --> 48:08.764
From the beginning.

48:08.764 --> 48:12.851
All those years, she was the one
who sent me to United States,

48:13.685 --> 48:16.396
the one who destroyed both of our lives.

48:24.238 --> 48:26.156
You cannot go back there, Margo.

48:34.331 --> 48:35.624
Ranger, <i>Happy Valley.</i>

48:35.624 --> 48:37.459
<i>We show a good departure burn.</i>

48:37.459 --> 48:39.127
<i>No significant residuals.</i>

48:39.127 --> 48:41.880
Copy. Pre-valves are confirmed closed.

48:42.673 --> 48:44.675
Departure burn is complete.

48:44.675 --> 48:50.264
Trajectory for 2003LC intercept
on target, people.

48:50.264 --> 48:53.141
<i>Sinclair, please
double-check the surface contact angles.</i>

48:53.141 --> 48:55.686
<i>Make sure we don't need
to increase cable tension.</i>

48:56.854 --> 49:00.065
Copy, scooter. We should
be fine, but I'll take another look.

49:02.651 --> 49:05.237
<i>Reading you five by on VHF.</i>

49:06.822 --> 49:10.576
<i>Actually, let me know when you have
an updated state back quickly.</i>

49:13.537 --> 49:16.331
Doppler shows
closing rate 12 meters per second.

49:17.416 --> 49:20.002
<i>Got it? Guidance has accepted.</i>

49:24.423 --> 49:26.508
Yeah, sure. Control turn to auto.

49:26.508 --> 49:27.926
Copy, Happy Valley.

49:27.926 --> 49:30.345
Please confirm S-band, comm.

49:33.390 --> 49:36.894
<i>Confirming RTS...</i>

49:41.190 --> 49:44.109
<i>RTS S-band at 1.53.</i>

50:14.890 --> 50:16.058
Fuck me.
