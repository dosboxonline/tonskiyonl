00:13.750 --> 00:14.708
Needle.

00:22.000 --> 00:22.916
Thread.

00:29.041 --> 00:29.958
Anvil.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.375
Forehead.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.416
Thank you. We are done.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.125
What have you pilfered from daddy's bag?

01:53.208 --> 01:54.041
Hush.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.250
What do you hear?

02:15.375 --> 02:17.833
A song. You were singing!

02:27.666 --> 02:28.875
Daddy!

02:35.166 --> 02:36.208
There, there.

03:07.583 --> 03:08.500
Hello.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.750
PROF. RAFAŁ WILCZUR
SURGEON

03:21.625 --> 03:22.958
Did something happen?

03:23.458 --> 03:24.375
Read it.

03:38.541 --> 03:39.541
Not this.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.958
Here.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.083
Go ahead.

03:47.875 --> 03:51.041
"Countess Karnkowska will dance again."

03:51.125 --> 03:54.666
It's about the patient.
Fell from a horse, blah, blah…

03:54.750 --> 03:56.541
Here it is. Listen.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.125
"Luckily, she met Professor Dobraniecki."

03:59.208 --> 04:00.750
You are not a professor yet.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.291
"After a complicated knee surgery…"

04:04.375 --> 04:05.875
We operated on the hip.

04:06.375 --> 04:09.708
Hip, knee, who cares?
The point is, they wrote about it.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.375
The old man was elated.
This morning, he promised--

04:14.458 --> 04:17.666
Well, he implied it,
but it sounded like a promise.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.000
Just say it already.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.291
Look.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.583
DR. JERZY DOBRANIECKI
CHIEF SURGEON

04:35.208 --> 04:36.125
He promised?

04:36.208 --> 04:39.291
-Implied.
-And you already have a plaque?

04:41.791 --> 04:45.416
I ordered it a year ago.
A good doctor has to think ahead.

04:46.250 --> 04:50.000
Get dressed. We're going out.
This calls for a celebration.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.000
Chief's orders.

04:53.708 --> 04:56.125
Maybe he didn't promise,
but he implied it.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.708
Think about it. Maliszewski is retiring.

04:58.791 --> 05:01.833
The old man hates Kalinowski.
Then who? Wurtz?

05:02.416 --> 05:03.333
A man of merit.

05:03.416 --> 05:05.958
Very much so. Lots of accomplishments.

05:06.041 --> 05:10.291
They're all men of merit.
Hausman, Kopeć, Koperski.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.958
Remember what the director said
when he took over?

05:13.041 --> 05:15.875
He wants young, talented people. Like you.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.750
You may not be young, but you're talented.

05:18.833 --> 05:20.541
You lack only one thing.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.333
Potential. Do you know why?

05:22.833 --> 05:26.166
Because you can't talk to the press
or anyone else.

05:26.250 --> 05:29.125
-A sullen doctor won't bring in sponsors.
-Warsaw Courier!

05:29.208 --> 05:30.583
That's why you have me.

05:30.666 --> 05:34.500
-Get your morning paper!
-Hey, kid! Want to make a buck?

05:34.583 --> 05:35.416
Yeah.

05:36.416 --> 05:38.125
-Do you have more?
-Sure.

05:38.208 --> 05:39.791
-I'll take ten.
-Mom!

05:44.041 --> 05:46.083
Looking for a new wallpaper
for your office?

05:46.166 --> 05:49.375
Go on, laugh,
but you'd better hold on to me.

05:50.041 --> 05:54.833
Soon you'll be doing surgeries
that will make us famous across Europe.

05:59.833 --> 06:00.916
Look out!

06:10.458 --> 06:12.458
Staś! My baby!

06:15.125 --> 06:16.125
My baby!

06:17.791 --> 06:20.333
Careful. I'm a doctor.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.708
Move aside.

06:30.083 --> 06:33.708
Do you have insurance?
Does your husband work?

06:33.791 --> 06:34.625
What?

06:40.250 --> 06:41.291
How is he?

06:45.333 --> 06:46.708
Rafał?

06:46.791 --> 06:47.916
He's alive.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.750
-Public hospital?
-It's too far.

06:57.791 --> 07:00.166
-Let's go to the clinic.
-What?

07:07.083 --> 07:10.541
Call the anesthesiologist.
Prepare the operating room.

07:11.375 --> 07:12.916
We have internal bleeding.

07:14.750 --> 07:15.916
Staś…

07:18.041 --> 07:19.958
Nurse, quickly. To the operating room.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.125
Kocher clamp.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.666
More cloth.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.875
Blood pressure is dropping.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.875
-It's slowing down.
-More oxygen.

07:47.708 --> 07:48.583
Big clamp.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.458
-Cloth.
-He stopped.

07:58.916 --> 07:59.791
Take over.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.000
More saline.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.833
Saline.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.333
Rafał, he's not going to make it.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.375
Continue.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.250
Check it.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.208
No pulse.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.458
Don't give up, Staś.

08:35.625 --> 08:36.750
Keep fighting.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.458
Wait.

08:40.375 --> 08:41.208
There's a pulse.

08:50.625 --> 08:51.708
Let's continue.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.250
Giddyap!

09:37.083 --> 09:38.291
Is the Lady upstairs?

09:39.166 --> 09:44.833
Sir, ever since you graciously
decided to marry the Lady,

09:45.458 --> 09:49.333
she is always upstairs.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.333
Good night.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.791
Why can't you be happy with me?

12:06.041 --> 12:06.916
Where is Staś?

12:07.625 --> 12:08.916
His mother took him away.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.708
Who authorized that?

12:12.416 --> 12:14.958
-Who signed off on it?
-Dr. Dobraniecki.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.791
I must bring him back.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.583
It's a private clinic.
The old man will kill you.

12:24.666 --> 12:27.416
-I'll pay.
-Do you know how expensive it is?

12:27.500 --> 12:28.666
I'll pay!

12:52.750 --> 12:54.000
In that basement.

12:57.541 --> 12:58.541
Here.

13:14.166 --> 13:20.041
Clouds in the sky, pray tell
how to save Staś from the spell.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.208
Boy's under the hat, girl's under the cap,

13:24.291 --> 13:27.375
Jewish braid, I beg thee!

13:27.458 --> 13:31.333
-Holy Mother, come to me!
-Please leave.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.083
May all the ails leave
for the woods, moors, fields, and clouds.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.375
-For forking paths--
-Now.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.625
May they help him.

13:39.708 --> 13:44.708
May they help thee!

13:47.750 --> 13:50.416
-You needn't have come, sir--
-Hush!

14:02.875 --> 14:07.666
But, sir, he can't be helped.
It's in God's hands now.

14:07.750 --> 14:08.833
Call the carriage!

14:09.375 --> 14:10.791
Who do you think you are?

14:11.291 --> 14:13.583
Taking a child from his guardian?

14:13.666 --> 14:14.958
By force?

14:15.041 --> 14:18.458
Staś needed immediate help.
Under the circumstances--

14:18.541 --> 14:21.333
One word about Hippocrates,
and I'll throw you out.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.958
I spoke to the board.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.833
In our exclusive clinic, there is place--

14:27.916 --> 14:29.250
There is no place.

14:29.333 --> 14:30.708
But there should be.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.208
We wish there was.

14:32.791 --> 14:33.625
Exactly.

14:33.708 --> 14:37.416
We wish there was a place
for poor children in our clinic.

14:37.500 --> 14:41.875
We are doing everything we can,
but it is up to our sponsors' generosity.

14:44.333 --> 14:47.500
Sir, every year in Poland,
quackery and ignorance

14:47.583 --> 14:48.791
lead to the deaths of--

14:48.875 --> 14:50.833
Enough with the ignorance.

14:51.541 --> 14:54.916
-We could mention the quackery.
-Only in passing.

14:55.625 --> 14:59.250
Just a few words.
But the speech should be optimistic.

15:03.208 --> 15:05.000
A speech for whom?

15:05.625 --> 15:09.583
With the considerable help
of the Ministry of Public Health,

15:10.333 --> 15:15.750
we are opening a surgical ward
for children from poor families.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.416
Thus, the Hippocratic Oath is fulfilled.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.416
This wonderful initiative
would not have been possible

15:23.500 --> 15:29.583
without the hard work and commitment
of Professor Rafał Wilczur.

15:29.666 --> 15:31.541
From this day on,

15:31.625 --> 15:36.625
he will be overseeing the entire clinic
as our chief surgeon. Bravo!

15:39.333 --> 15:41.333
Bravo for the minister!

15:45.125 --> 15:47.791
A ward for poor children, beautiful.

15:47.875 --> 15:52.291
Thanks to the likes of you,
we will revive our healthcare system.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.916
It's not about me. It was a team effort.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.916
You are too modest.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.708
Doctor.
Kazimierz Szabłowski, Kurier Polski.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.916
What can you tell me about Doctor Wilczur?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.625
Read the papers. He's in all of them.

16:07.708 --> 16:10.833
Will you come to Ziemiańska this evening?

16:10.916 --> 16:11.916
Great idea.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.458
I'm afraid I can't.

16:14.541 --> 16:18.000
Are you sure?
You would meet some important people.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.041
It's my daughter's birthday, Minister.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.750
How is the Lady feeling?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.375
Call Marysia.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.250
Candles!

16:50.083 --> 16:52.375
FOR MY DEAREST GIRL

16:52.458 --> 16:54.166
Candles and plates!

16:54.250 --> 16:55.333
From the Lady.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.875
The Lady said that she will

17:10.291 --> 17:12.416
write again when she settles down.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.541
Beata!

18:39.333 --> 18:41.125
Do you like dancing?

18:42.500 --> 18:46.541
All he wants to do is dance.
He's no help at all.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.333
What's your name?

18:52.416 --> 18:55.708
Michał, stop bothering the ladies.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.041
Giddyap, horsey.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.208
Are we going to live in a forest?

20:03.375 --> 20:06.166
-In a forester's house.
-You'll like it.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.916
-I'm Jan.
-I'm Marysia.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.791
Come inside.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.750
Jerzy Dobraniecki speaking.

20:36.833 --> 20:38.791
She left me. Ran away.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.708
What?

20:40.375 --> 20:43.000
Remember where Beata used to live
before we got married?

20:43.541 --> 20:44.750
I'm here. Come.

20:44.833 --> 20:45.666
All right.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.000
I'll be right there.

21:22.958 --> 21:23.791
Wait.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.666
-Do you know Beata Olszańska?
-No.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.125
Wait!

21:31.083 --> 21:32.750
Don't worry, I won't harm you.

21:36.666 --> 21:39.458
Her aunt Helena used to live here.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.375
Did she move?

21:43.958 --> 21:44.791
Come with me.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.333
Hey, cutie!

22:46.416 --> 22:47.291
Come here!

23:50.041 --> 23:56.041
FORGOTTEN LOVE

23:57.958 --> 23:58.875
He's dead?

24:04.041 --> 24:05.833
It must have been a robbery.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.500
Question the neighbors.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.208
We think it was suicide.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.041
How come?

24:14.208 --> 24:18.083
His wife left him and took the child.
He was devastated.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.791
She left a note.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.583
Why do you think it was a robbery?

24:24.166 --> 24:26.875
I don't know. Just a hunch.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.541
I didn't say that categorically--

24:29.625 --> 24:31.666
That's exactly what you said.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.958
The suicide of our chief surgeon
doesn't sound good.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.333
When can we collect the body?

24:40.541 --> 24:44.916
There is no body.
We only found a coat by the river.

24:46.458 --> 24:49.291
The body will surely resurface one day.

25:11.125 --> 25:15.916
15 YEARS LATER

25:24.000 --> 25:26.916
So now you have no family left?

25:29.166 --> 25:30.666
I am Little Orphan Mary.

25:32.750 --> 25:36.000
I would marry you, but I'm already taken.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.125
You're lucky any girl wanted you.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.875
What about you?

25:44.083 --> 25:44.958
Listen.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.958
My Justysia's cousin is quite handsome.

25:48.041 --> 25:50.500
He has seven acres and a horse.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.875
You want me to marry a horse?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.625
I don't need a husband. I need a job.

25:57.291 --> 25:59.125
I promised Mom I would get a degree.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.041
How?

26:02.708 --> 26:03.708
I'll earn the money.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.250
Do you know anyone
who wants to buy a piano?

26:13.041 --> 26:14.083
In Radoliszki?

26:55.666 --> 26:58.500
Beautiful. Zeyer sheyn.

27:00.375 --> 27:03.125
Very beautiful. Tzimes!

27:06.333 --> 27:07.250
It's just that

27:08.250 --> 27:12.458
I'm a poshete yid, a simple Jew.
I can't play.

27:14.666 --> 27:18.750
With all due respect,
I have no need for a piano.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.458
Great, because I don't want to sell it.

27:21.541 --> 27:26.333
Then what's your gesheft
that you brought this piano here?

27:27.916 --> 27:29.958
I want to give it to you.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.250
Give it to me?

27:34.500 --> 27:35.583
For how much?

27:36.583 --> 27:37.500
For free.

27:38.541 --> 27:41.875
I don't need it anymore.
I have no house to put it in.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.416
You could put it over there.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.166
Buying a piano, Dad?

27:50.041 --> 27:53.750
She wants to give it to us.
Ikh farshteyeh nisht.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.916
But you said you can't play.

27:58.041 --> 27:59.125
Shame.

28:00.291 --> 28:04.291
If you had music here,
people would stay and listen.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.916
They would be drinking and eating.

28:08.708 --> 28:12.208
But musicians are expensive.
Very expensive.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.375
You can play.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.375
I could give you a discount.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.583
And help in the kitchen or at the bar too.

28:22.666 --> 28:24.125
We need help.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.291
Don't tell me how to run my business!

28:27.291 --> 28:28.541
The guests are waiting!

28:35.125 --> 28:36.916
Das iz a metsiyeh.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.833
How much will it cost me
to get this piano for free?

29:23.500 --> 29:24.333
Giddyap!

29:29.666 --> 29:30.583
Whoa!

29:32.875 --> 29:33.750
It's here.

29:37.125 --> 29:40.000
You, working at an inn?
What will people say?

29:41.291 --> 29:44.750
They'll say, "Two shots and a beer.
And play something for us."

29:46.458 --> 29:47.708
I won't stay here long.

29:49.041 --> 29:52.250
-I'll earn some money and go to Warsaw.
-Sure you will.

29:56.416 --> 29:57.291
Morning!

30:01.333 --> 30:03.500
ROOM FOR RENT

30:45.291 --> 30:47.958
-Come here!
-Hush!

30:49.958 --> 30:51.333
Stop it!

31:08.791 --> 31:09.833
Tell me.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.375
What do I put in the report?

31:13.458 --> 31:18.083
Don't remember this, don't remember that.
You don't remember a thing!

31:20.458 --> 31:21.958
You know who doesn't remember?

31:23.875 --> 31:25.458
Those with a guilty conscience.

31:27.583 --> 31:29.625
Maybe that's me. I don't remember.

31:31.041 --> 31:33.541
How many times
have you been in jail for vagrancy?

31:34.458 --> 31:35.541
About ten.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.583
I'm not a vagrant.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.625
You're not?

31:42.583 --> 31:43.791
So what do you do?

31:46.666 --> 31:47.625
I'm searching.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.750
What are you searching for?

31:54.125 --> 31:55.166
The trouble is--

31:55.250 --> 31:57.083
You don't remember!

31:59.375 --> 32:00.875
Get him out of here, now!

32:00.958 --> 32:01.791
Yes, sir!

32:03.916 --> 32:05.291
Don't come back.

32:58.458 --> 32:59.500
Jesus!

33:03.166 --> 33:04.833
That bloody count!

33:09.875 --> 33:11.208
Watch your hands.

33:11.291 --> 33:14.833
For that, you can go
to the dance in Radoliszki.

33:14.916 --> 33:16.666
I can't go. We lost a wheel.

33:16.750 --> 33:17.916
Shut up.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.333
Damned lump.

33:21.458 --> 33:25.375
We need help.
We can't lift the wagon by ourselves.

33:25.958 --> 33:27.666
Everyone's at the dance.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.000
I'll help.

33:56.750 --> 33:59.250
Marysia, come, sit with us!

33:59.875 --> 34:01.416
Dance with me, then.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.375
Ask Ruta.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.083
I don't want a Jew.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.250
And who are you?

34:06.333 --> 34:07.500
I'm a Pole!

34:07.583 --> 34:08.458
A drunk!

34:11.583 --> 34:12.750
You're the one I want!

34:39.208 --> 34:40.666
Sholem Aleyhem!

34:40.750 --> 34:43.833
Hello! Welcome, gentlemen.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.500
Come in, dear Count and Baron.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.833
I have a special table just for you.

34:50.541 --> 34:52.000
You lost, my friend.

34:53.916 --> 34:55.500
This way, gentlemen.

34:59.208 --> 35:02.250
The local heir, Count Czyński.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.208
Move your fingers.

35:14.041 --> 35:17.166
Nothing is broken,
but the shoulder needs to be set.

35:17.791 --> 35:19.333
Who are you, a doctor?

35:20.833 --> 35:22.916
I'm not, but I can help you.

35:29.375 --> 35:30.375
Lie down.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.375
Stop yelling.

35:45.375 --> 35:46.458
The pain is gone.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.125
It's gone, God be my witness.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.083
Country life does have its perks.

36:11.166 --> 36:14.041
It does? Where are they?

36:17.500 --> 36:21.166
Let's make a bet. You bet the motorcycle--

36:21.250 --> 36:22.958
Losing the race wasn't enough?

36:23.666 --> 36:25.833
I played in Monte Carlo
for a week straight.

36:33.208 --> 36:36.958
Marysia, come. Leave it.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.166
Let's go!

37:31.583 --> 37:32.625
Done.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.458
Here.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.250
What's your name?

37:59.583 --> 38:00.500
Antoni.

38:01.833 --> 38:02.833
Antoni Kosiba.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.958
Zofia.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.583
Zofia? Look at her!

38:12.833 --> 38:14.291
-How's the shoulder?
-What?

38:17.250 --> 38:18.458
How's the arm?

38:20.916 --> 38:22.750
You will need a sling.

38:23.833 --> 38:27.208
Wear it for a few weeks.
You can use a scarf.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.791
-Can you do it?
-Can you?

38:31.750 --> 38:34.375
I'm going to Radom.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.541
What for?

38:36.375 --> 38:37.375
I don't know.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.625
Then maybe you're not going to Radom.

38:41.208 --> 38:43.500
Maybe to Rzeszów or Kraków.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.083
Perhaps.

38:45.958 --> 38:47.541
Maybe you're going to my place.

38:49.916 --> 38:53.041
To my mill. If you're looking for a job.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.958
I don't remember what I am looking for.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.500
One week, and she'll be mine.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.416
Want to bet your motorcycle on that?

39:19.583 --> 39:21.125
Your mare.

39:21.208 --> 39:24.208
My mare? Do you know how much she's worth?

39:28.083 --> 39:30.291
-What can I get you?
-You're on.

39:33.625 --> 39:35.791
Three glasses. What is your name?

39:37.125 --> 39:38.458
Marysia. Just the glasses?

39:38.541 --> 39:41.166
We brought our own cognac.
Care to join us?

39:42.916 --> 39:46.000
Allow me to introduce myself.
Count Leszek Czyński.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.083
My friend, Baron Krzeszowski.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.125
-He's an enthusiast--
-I'll get the glasses.

40:04.291 --> 40:05.375
What did he tell you?

40:07.166 --> 40:08.291
He asked for glasses.

40:10.291 --> 40:12.750
I meant Zenek. You talked to him.

40:12.833 --> 40:15.875
Forget that goy. He doesn't deserve you.

40:43.416 --> 40:44.583
I have an idea.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.500
If you lose the bet,

40:47.500 --> 40:50.208
you'll work here as a waiter
for one whole day.

40:52.833 --> 40:56.416
-Are you trying to offend me?
-A bet is a bet. I bet my mare.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.750
You can bet a mare or a palace,

40:59.541 --> 41:00.916
but not your honor.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.041
As you wish.

41:10.625 --> 41:11.500
No.

41:17.291 --> 41:18.375
He likes you.

41:18.458 --> 41:21.583
I'm the best dancer here,
but he wasn't staring at me.

41:23.625 --> 41:25.875
Here he comes, Countess.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.375
You have bewitched me, miss.
I am enraptured.

41:40.166 --> 41:41.083
By your dancing.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.000
Thank you.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.583
Do you wish to pay?
For two empty glasses--

41:50.375 --> 41:51.416
Keep the change.

41:54.041 --> 41:55.583
Mr. Rosenstein will be elated.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.708
Do come again, please.

41:58.208 --> 41:59.500
Be sure I will.

42:06.458 --> 42:11.041
Unfortunately, you won't win the mare.
I'm sorry, Mr. Czyński.

42:26.333 --> 42:27.291
I'll walk you home.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.416
No need.

42:31.291 --> 42:33.166
Then I'll just walk along.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.583
Anyone can just walk down the street.

42:36.333 --> 42:39.416
And if I want to jump, I'll jump.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.708
What? Anyone can just jump.

42:43.458 --> 42:44.625
Stop it, Zenek.

42:45.416 --> 42:46.750
I will when you marry me.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.250
What do you have to lose?

42:51.458 --> 42:52.833
We'll have money.

42:53.416 --> 42:55.666
Father will give me his leather shop.

42:56.666 --> 42:59.791
I'm in great shape.
I can carry you around all day.

43:07.333 --> 43:08.333
Marysia.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.166
My mother didn't love my father,
didn't even know him,

43:12.250 --> 43:15.500
but he gave Grandpa a cow and two heifers,
and now they're happy.

43:15.583 --> 43:18.375
First horses, now cows?
What am I, a maiden goat?

43:35.708 --> 43:36.958
Do you play chess?

43:37.625 --> 43:41.583
My late husband bought the set.
He couldn't play, but he liked having it.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.541
When did he die?

43:45.708 --> 43:48.666
It will be seven years
this Saint Roch feast.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.791
He was sickly.

43:52.208 --> 43:54.500
Zośka did everything in the mill.

43:54.583 --> 43:56.541
Even the punching.

43:56.625 --> 43:58.000
Careful, or I'll punch you.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.125
Yes, he was sickly,

44:02.333 --> 44:05.750
but he bought books and studied languages.

44:06.833 --> 44:10.791
Do you know what matricaria chamo--

44:10.875 --> 44:13.625
Come on, who needs to know that?

44:13.708 --> 44:17.416
A man should build a house,
plant a tree, and make babies.

44:17.916 --> 44:18.958
Go make some.

44:19.958 --> 44:21.625
If you're up for it…

44:24.208 --> 44:25.291
Sit down, Antoni.

44:32.333 --> 44:33.333
Cheers.

44:51.375 --> 44:54.416
Matricaria chamomilla. It's chamomile.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.291
Maybe you're a prince?

45:10.458 --> 45:11.666
Or a baron?

45:13.291 --> 45:15.583
Maybe you have some overseas estates?

45:16.458 --> 45:17.791
Perhaps.

45:19.708 --> 45:23.000
Or maybe I'm a criminal,
and I killed someone.

45:25.250 --> 45:27.250
Can happen to anyone when they're angry.

45:29.625 --> 45:31.083
What if you have a wife?

45:36.750 --> 45:39.250
Or worst of all, if you're a priest?

45:42.041 --> 45:43.708
Priests are people too.

45:46.583 --> 45:48.458
I don't think you're a priest.

45:49.375 --> 45:52.916
A priest doing actual physical work?
Impossible.

47:38.958 --> 47:41.625
I came to ask if you needed anything.

47:45.083 --> 47:46.375
No, thank you.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.333
I have all I need.

47:55.208 --> 47:56.125
Good night.

48:19.750 --> 48:22.083
Yesterday I unintentionally
made you upset.

48:23.625 --> 48:24.666
I'm not upset.

48:27.875 --> 48:28.916
In any case,

48:30.458 --> 48:31.916
I put your honor in jeopardy.

48:35.125 --> 48:37.000
If I could duel myself--

48:37.083 --> 48:39.625
I think it was your honor
you put in jeopardy.

48:41.083 --> 48:45.416
You made an oaf of yourself.
You're the one who should feel upset.

48:47.625 --> 48:50.083
Can I make it up to you somehow?

48:50.166 --> 48:51.333
Just leave me alone.

49:26.750 --> 49:28.958
I didn't want to offend you.

49:29.041 --> 49:29.958
When?

49:36.250 --> 49:39.000
I just asked if you needed anything.

49:40.208 --> 49:41.708
Don't read too much into it.

49:43.083 --> 49:44.541
Zośka!

49:47.375 --> 49:48.666
What?

49:48.750 --> 49:50.208
Zośka!

49:50.916 --> 49:53.958
Michał's pinned down! A tree fell on him!

49:54.041 --> 49:56.625
-Heavens! Is he alive?
-They say so.

49:56.708 --> 49:57.875
Such a good lad.

49:57.958 --> 49:58.916
Where is he?

49:59.666 --> 50:00.875
At the logging ground.

50:22.541 --> 50:26.291
I'm not paying you to stare!
I told you to be careful.

50:26.375 --> 50:29.208
This is what daydreaming gets you.

50:29.291 --> 50:30.291
Mind his head.

50:31.583 --> 50:33.750
Here. Buy him some medicine.

50:34.875 --> 50:37.958
That's not enough for a doctor.
He needs surgery.

50:38.041 --> 50:40.250
-Then give it back.
-Thank you, sir.

50:40.333 --> 50:43.958
That's settled.
Back to work, or you won't get paid!

50:44.041 --> 50:45.625
He needs to go to the hospital!

50:46.416 --> 50:47.625
What are you doing here?

50:48.125 --> 50:50.208
It's not a big deal. He'll be fine.

51:01.208 --> 51:03.583
I must see Count Stanisław Czyński.

51:04.500 --> 51:06.416
-Is he expecting you?
-No.

51:07.125 --> 51:09.208
-The Count is having tea.
-Where?

51:09.291 --> 51:12.208
Stop! You cannot go in unannounced!

51:13.291 --> 51:14.833
You simply cannot!

51:16.291 --> 51:18.166
Miss, this can't be!

51:27.166 --> 51:31.166
I apologize for the intrusion,
but there was an accident in your sawmill.

51:31.250 --> 51:34.000
"Your sawmill"?
What kind of language is that?

51:35.708 --> 51:37.083
There was an accident,

51:37.791 --> 51:39.625
in case you don't understand Polish.

51:41.041 --> 51:44.291
Your worker of many years has broken legs.

51:45.208 --> 51:49.125
He needs-- These are awfully poor people.

51:50.208 --> 51:51.458
This is your duty.

51:52.291 --> 51:53.541
Poor accent.

51:54.250 --> 51:55.458
Not Parisian at all.

51:56.291 --> 51:59.333
As for the matter
you disturbed our family meal with,

52:00.625 --> 52:02.416
I will say only one thing.

52:03.083 --> 52:05.000
-Leave the palace at once.
-Mom.

52:06.458 --> 52:07.500
Józef!

52:21.291 --> 52:22.333
Get on, Marysia!

52:24.000 --> 52:26.458
-It's Miss Marysia to you!
-Call me Leszek.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.583
Do you want to help him or not?

52:37.416 --> 52:39.958
Dr. Pawlicki is a great specialist.

52:40.500 --> 52:43.041
He was there when Grandpa died.
Mom loves him.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.583
I can't tell much in these conditions.

53:32.166 --> 53:33.375
God bless you.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.333
May I take a look?

53:36.416 --> 53:37.666
Are you a doctor?

53:39.208 --> 53:42.291
I am not, but I can help.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.041
Quackery is forbidden.

53:48.625 --> 53:49.708
Please leave.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.041
You could go to prison for that.

54:06.208 --> 54:07.125
I'm sorry.

54:25.833 --> 54:27.250
Can you help us, Count?

54:27.333 --> 54:30.041
Honestly, miss.
The count has graciously agreed to pay.

54:30.125 --> 54:31.000
I'll help.

54:32.166 --> 54:33.125
Thank you.

54:39.333 --> 54:40.916
-Hey.
-Will I walk?

54:41.000 --> 54:44.375
You'll dance. I promise.

55:04.166 --> 55:06.875
They'll call you when the surgery is over.

55:08.333 --> 55:10.083
There are no phones here.

55:15.833 --> 55:18.291
Right. It's awfully poor out here.

55:20.583 --> 55:21.708
Strange, isn't it?

55:22.833 --> 55:26.666
Three years of working for the count,
and Michał has nothing to show for it.

55:27.916 --> 55:29.875
Still, maybe I deserve a "thank you."

55:31.791 --> 55:33.625
Should I kiss your hand, sir?

55:34.916 --> 55:36.083
He works for you.

55:37.125 --> 55:39.750
He toiled away for your motorcycle,
your palace.

55:40.541 --> 55:41.958
Your pants from Paris.

55:42.041 --> 55:44.375
From Milan. I have a tailor there.

55:44.458 --> 55:47.833
Why don't you tell your tailor
to make you a pair of pants

55:47.916 --> 55:51.666
that will make you brave enough
to enter a village hut? A special design.

55:51.750 --> 55:52.666
All right, enough.

55:55.458 --> 55:57.916
I'll call Pawlicki and ask how it went.
I promise.

56:00.416 --> 56:02.291
-Do you need a ride?
-No.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.250
The cinema is coming!

56:07.833 --> 56:09.041
Let's go together!

56:11.083 --> 56:11.958
Please.

56:12.041 --> 56:13.250
What's on?

56:22.833 --> 56:27.416
How can you deceive your heart

56:27.500 --> 56:31.916
When it knows much more than you?

56:32.000 --> 56:36.375
How can you tell your heart no

56:36.458 --> 56:41.041
When it trembles like a leaf?

56:41.125 --> 56:45.500
You don't know yet who he is

56:45.583 --> 56:49.583
Your beloved, someone dear

56:50.166 --> 56:54.500
And yet love is signaling

56:54.583 --> 57:01.583
That your life has changed for good

57:02.916 --> 57:07.416
The first sign is when a heart leaps

57:07.500 --> 57:11.958
When it does, you are so sure

57:12.041 --> 57:19.041
That he is the only one

57:21.541 --> 57:28.541
Just show me your foggy eyes

57:30.583 --> 57:33.750
Then I'll know for sure

57:33.833 --> 57:39.500
That you love me true

57:40.416 --> 57:46.250
The first sign is when a heart leaps

57:46.333 --> 57:50.791
When it does, you are so sure

57:50.875 --> 57:54.500
That he is

57:55.291 --> 58:01.708
The only one

58:32.750 --> 58:34.041
DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME

58:38.833 --> 58:41.416
You're thinking about that gal?

58:43.208 --> 58:44.125
I am.

58:45.125 --> 58:46.125
You fancy her?

58:48.500 --> 58:50.125
It's not that.

58:54.583 --> 58:56.500
Why did you stare? Do you know her?

58:58.666 --> 59:00.375
I don't know. I don't remember.

59:01.416 --> 59:02.541
I've seen her once.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.875
At Michał's.
She wanted to send me to prison.

59:06.958 --> 59:07.916
For what?

59:09.583 --> 59:10.666
For quackery.

59:13.208 --> 59:14.958
She's tiny but full of herself.

59:15.666 --> 59:20.083
One good kick from me,
and even you won't put her together.

59:28.083 --> 59:29.791
-Did you like it?
-I did.

59:32.208 --> 59:33.666
You like romance films.

59:34.958 --> 59:36.250
I haven't seen many.

59:37.958 --> 59:39.416
My mother loved them.

59:40.416 --> 59:43.750
She liked all movies,
but she loved romances most.

59:45.750 --> 59:46.875
She died last year.

59:48.125 --> 59:49.541
My dad passed away recently.

59:50.125 --> 59:50.958
I'm sorry.

59:53.333 --> 59:54.791
My mother was rich.

59:57.208 --> 01:00:00.791
She had a house, furs, even a grand piano.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:06.250
But when she met my father,
she just gave it all up.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.416
She didn't take a single dress,
just followed him to the end of the world.

01:00:12.791 --> 01:00:13.708
Where was that?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.625
Nearby.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:18.041
The Kozienicki Forest.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.583
My dad was a forester.

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:23.416
How did you end up in Radoliszki?

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:31.291
By chance. Michał brought me here.
We're childhood friends.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.750
He's all I have.

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:41.125
What about me?

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:45.291
You come from a different world.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.333
So what?

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.416
You just said your mother left--

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.458
This has been a truly lovely evening.

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.541
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:57.541
Hi.

01:01:58.666 --> 01:02:00.750
-Why are you here?
-To visit Michał.

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:02.000
The count brought this.

01:02:04.583 --> 01:02:09.083
An oyster flies right into his mouth
In goes lobster and some Chablis

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:13.583
He opens his mouth and smacks his lips
Caresses his belly, yippee!

01:02:13.666 --> 01:02:14.708
How are you?

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:17.833
I'll be fine.

01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:20.416
Of course you will.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:23.750
It doesn't hurt, but it itches.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:25.000
He keeps scratching.

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.166
Ready.

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:30.833
Enjoy.

01:02:39.416 --> 01:02:42.958
Seafood is rich in protein,
as well as vitamins and minerals.

01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:45.958
-It's good for the brain and the heart.
-And the legs?

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:48.208
Just try it.

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:00.458
Very good.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.416
Take me somewhere else!

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.583
I can't. I promised Rosenstein.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.791
-How to turn it off?
-Here.

01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:29.208
INN

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:31.000
Why do you still work there? Quit.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.791
Some of us
have to pay for college ourselves.

01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:37.333
Besides,

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.041
I like it.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.208
Come on.

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:44.666
What?

01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:49.000
Remember when I came to the pub?

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.291
The day we met?

01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:51.750
You bet a horse.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:52.708
A mare.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:55.125
Doesn't matter. There was no bet.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:56.875
Who knows.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:00.125
Don't you believe me? There was no bet.

01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:04.750
That fool suggested that if he won,
I'd have to be a waiter here for a day.

01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:07.083
What did you say to that?

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:11.583
Count Czyński working in a Jewish inn?
Can you imagine?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.125
I can't.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.250
Marysia, that's not what I meant.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.208
I'm sorry.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.208
You're a count, and I'm a waitress.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.125
This could never work.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:40.083
Walczakowa? Not feeling well?

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:42.500
-Why?
-Why are you here?

01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:43.958
He only sees sick people.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:45.916
My back's acting up.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.208
Your "acting up"
put three husbands six feet under.

01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:51.416
What about you? You're no better.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.416
This is my house. The healer's mine too.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:06:00.083
If you want a man,
go to Radom and walk the streets!

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:05.166
Thank you, Mr. Kosiba.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.458
Next.

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.458
I'll take your queen.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:28.666
Go ahead.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.458
What's wrong with Walczakowa?

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:49.750
Healthy as a horse.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.333
Then why did you examine her?

01:06:55.791 --> 01:06:59.083
If I didn't,
how would I know she's not sick?

01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:05.041
You're not jealous, are you?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.250
You're not mine.

01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:13.541
You're a free man.

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.916
But I don't want
to see Walczakowa here again.

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.875
She can go to the doctor.

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:24.291
That's what they are for.
She's just bothering you.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:35.583
I'll kill a rooster.

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:40.041
Want a rooster for dinner?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.458
Who is that, Zośka?
Have you hired a new field hand?

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.958
Perhaps I have, perhaps I haven't.

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:43.166
Stop staring. You'll sprain your eyes.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.541
Don't worry about me.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:48.625
Think of that poor priest
who'll have to hear your confession.

01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:50.791
Don't worry about my sins.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.416
Are four bags enough?

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.666
-How long will you be gone?
-Long. Perhaps forever.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:42.708
With that waitress?

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:48.541
Being a waitress is as good a job as any.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.500
This is what you want to do?

01:09:50.583 --> 01:09:53.833
If you bring shame on our name,
you will have to leave the palace.

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:55.708
I am leaving.

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.166
I will disinherit you!

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.833
Where are you taking this boot?

01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:02.041
It's my boot. I bought it.

01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:45.833
He's young. Have faith.

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:52.666
Go away!

01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:07.416
Your wife came to see me.

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:15.625
People say you were in jail,

01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.708
that you wander the world seeking a buck.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:22.708
I don't know what I'm seeking.

01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:26.208
It's not my business,
but you're the only stranger around here.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:29.791
My own folks won't help me,
and a stranger…

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:33.458
Why do you care? You don't even know me.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:45.250
It's useless.

01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:47.916
No point in staring.

01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:50.958
The doctors have already seen it.

01:11:58.666 --> 01:12:00.500
Can you move your toe?

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:02.333
What's the difference?

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:04.791
I can't bend it. I can't walk.

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:07.916
Can you feel my touch?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.583
What I feel is anger and such sorrow.
I want to--

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:12.791
I meant the leg.

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:23.125
So you do feel it.

01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:27.541
My wife went to the market.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:30.875
She'll be back in two hours.

01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:35.000
I can't do it myself.

01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:40.041
I can't crawl to the river
or hang a noose on the tree.

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:46.416
This is all I've got.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.291
Will you do it?

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:55.208
-I'm begging you!
-Put it away, you fool.

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:57.791
Please…

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:09.416
Will it hurt?

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:15.666
A lot?

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:19.291
A lot.

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:22.333
With a knife?

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.875
A hammer and a chisel.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:41.916
What are you doing?

01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:48.208
-I'm calling the police.
-Stay out of it!

01:13:48.833 --> 01:13:51.375
Understand? I don't want your advice.

01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:53.791
-Michał--
-I asked him to kill me!

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.833
That's what he's doing!

01:13:57.083 --> 01:14:00.375
Have you ever operated on a human being?

01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:02.291
I don't remember.

01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:05.208
Want to help?

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.333
You've gone mad.

01:14:08.416 --> 01:14:09.458
If not, leave.

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:11.416
This is no place for you.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
-Michał--
-You heard him, get out.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.625
Now!

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:39.458
Bite this.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.541
Turn away.

01:15:39.916 --> 01:15:41.416
Just the beer, Mr. Wancerz?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.916
As always, My Lord.

01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:51.666
Waiter!

01:15:52.708 --> 01:15:53.708
Vodka!

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.125
-Right away.
-Make it cold and fast!

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:00.750
-Move your ass! I'm waiting!
-Zenek!

01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:01.708
What?

01:16:03.333 --> 01:16:04.541
The customer is king!

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:05.458
Sit down.

01:16:08.083 --> 01:16:09.125
Hey, Your Majesty!

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:16.416
He's meshugge.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.291
I'm sorry, My Lord.

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:19.875
-Zenek!
-It's fine.

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:22.458
-Here.
-Sod off!

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:27.625
I want to apologize.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.291
You're right.
Waiting tables is no dishonor.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.250
What do you expect? A hug?

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:39.750
I'm leaving.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:51.583
Go.

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:53.166
Loyf.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
He loves you.

01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:57.666
Go. Loyf nakh im.

01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:22.875
I was doing pretty well.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.000
But instead of "garçon,"
they called me "My Lord."

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.166
You're no good, even as a waiter.

01:17:57.833 --> 01:18:00.458
I need a good wife. Will you marry me?

01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:04.666
A waiter with one boot?

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:13.500
Will you be my wife?

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:10.208
Will you say something?

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:14.958
Yes.

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:23.000
Yes, you will say something,
or yes, you will marry me?

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:27.416
Yes.

01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:55.625
Let's run away.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:58.041
Where to?

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:01.291
To the end of the world.

01:20:04.083 --> 01:20:05.166
Where is that?

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:07.958
Nearby.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.416
A small chapel in the woods.

01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:15.125
I know the priest. He'll marry us.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:34.625
Zośka!

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:41.416
Where is Lesień?
Send him to fetch the doctor!

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:43.708
Now!

01:21:57.416 --> 01:21:59.500
It's here!

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:06.458
Here!

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:11.500
This way.

01:22:18.916 --> 01:22:20.500
Come in, My Lady.

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:24.166
Leszek, dear God!

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.541
He has a broken leg
and a fractured collarbone.

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.666
He is unconscious, but he will make it.

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:33.416
Stop interrupting! Get out!

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.833
This is our home.

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.208
He will be fine.

01:22:36.833 --> 01:22:38.125
Save her, Doctor.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.583
I beg you, save her!

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:45.125
I'm not paying you to treat a waitress!
Stanisław!

01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:49.833
-Fractured skull.
-I know. She needs surgery.

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:52.666
She won't make it through the night.

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:56.166
-Do it.
-Here?

01:22:57.291 --> 01:23:00.666
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker.
Even Dr. Dobraniecki couldn't help.

01:23:02.166 --> 01:23:04.500
Take her to that Dobraniecki.

01:23:05.916 --> 01:23:09.583
I'll pay. I'll work my whole life.

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:13.666
All I can do is give her morphine
to reduce her suffering.

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:17.291
-Take her to the hospital.
-But, Dr. Pawlicki…

01:23:18.041 --> 01:23:20.333
I'm not a doctor. I just…

01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:21.875
Let's go.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.125
Bring in the stretcher!

01:23:40.833 --> 01:23:41.750
I'll help.

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:44.500
-Mom?
-I'm here, sweetheart.

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:47.250
Where is Marysia?

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:49.583
Marysia has died.

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.208
-Actually, I said--
-That she's dead.

01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:57.333
She is dead.

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:20.333
What?

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:22.916
I stole it.

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:27.541
No, I…

01:24:28.416 --> 01:24:30.916
I don't know how to do it. I can't.

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:32.708
How do you know?

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:35.458
You don't remember a thing.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:46.833
Scalpel.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.375
Lesień.

01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:22.458
This girl,

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:24.750
Marysia.

01:27:26.666 --> 01:27:27.958
Were you looking for her?

01:27:31.333 --> 01:27:32.250
I don't know.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.166
I don't remember.

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:42.791
Will she live?

01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:49.583
Not without a doctor.

01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:44.208
PROFESSOR RAFAŁ WILCZUR
1885-1920

01:28:44.958 --> 01:28:47.416
-Sir, what do I do?
-Doctor, I beg you!

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.208
-I'm so sorry--
-Please, help.

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:02.708
Ms. Jadzia,

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.166
leave us alone, please.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:07.958
Come in.

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:11.541
Thank you.

01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:21.291
You are…

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:27.833
a medical genius and a famed doctor.

01:29:29.083 --> 01:29:30.458
Only you can help me.

01:29:34.666 --> 01:29:38.416
My name is Antoni Kosiba.
I came from Radoliszki.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.375
It's a small village--

01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:42.416
Excuse me.

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:45.041
What is your name?

01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:48.833
Antoni Kosiba.

01:29:51.416 --> 01:29:52.708
I am poor, but…

01:29:57.791 --> 01:29:59.000
the girl will die.

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:03.875
I tried to help her, but…

01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:08.041
without your help, she'll die.

01:30:10.916 --> 01:30:12.958
Please, don't be silly.

01:30:14.416 --> 01:30:16.458
Don't make a scene. Please get up, Mr…

01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:19.958
Mr. Kosiba.

01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:37.458
Knock. It's not a barn.

01:30:38.208 --> 01:30:41.291
It seems that yesterday
someone took my instruments.

01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:43.208
Perhaps by mistake.

01:30:44.041 --> 01:30:45.333
Got any proof?

01:30:45.416 --> 01:30:47.000
There's proof right here!

01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:51.375
Someone performed a craniotomy.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:52.666
Impossible.

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:53.833
I can see it!

01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:56.500
I'd rather not involve the police.

01:31:07.291 --> 01:31:11.458
You said it was impossible
to operate here.

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:16.416
Otherwise, you wouldn't leave the girl
without proper care.

01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:21.375
What are you staring at?

01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:25.791
Go tell everyone
that a farmhand took your instruments

01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:27.500
and saved a girl's life!

01:31:27.583 --> 01:31:29.291
-May I have a look?
-No!

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.083
You had your chance yesterday.

01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:35.250
Dr. Dobraniecki will come to see her.

01:31:35.333 --> 01:31:36.458
Woman, you're mad.

01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:39.125
He wouldn't even see the count.

01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:42.416
-We had to go to Warsaw.
-He will come to me.

01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.375
I warn you, I won't drop this matter.

01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:51.125
One more thing.

01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:54.583
The ring belongs to the Czyński family.

01:31:54.666 --> 01:31:56.291
The countess wants it back.

01:31:57.166 --> 01:31:58.750
Marysia is alive.

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:03.000
If she wants to,
she will give it back herself.

01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:07.958
Where are you from?

01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:10.833
I don't remember.

01:32:14.083 --> 01:32:15.625
Any family?

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:20.083
I don't know.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:28.291
Do you work somewhere?

01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:30.458
In the mill.

01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:33.208
In the mill.

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:38.041
And you heal people after hours?

01:32:40.458 --> 01:32:42.083
Sometimes I help people.

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:45.458
Where did you learn that?

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:48.250
I don't remember.

01:32:56.083 --> 01:32:58.666
Are you going to stay in the mill?

01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:03.416
I'd like to.

01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:45.875
Leszek.

01:33:51.291 --> 01:33:52.125
She's alive.

01:33:53.625 --> 01:33:54.750
Thank the Lord.

01:33:56.875 --> 01:33:57.958
Where is Leszek?

01:34:01.833 --> 01:34:06.583
You had an accident
on the motorcycle, remember?

01:34:06.666 --> 01:34:08.416
Let's spare her the emotions for now.

01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:10.166
Is he alive?

01:34:11.291 --> 01:34:13.500
Count Czyński? He is.

01:34:14.208 --> 01:34:16.000
He's a bit bruised, that's all.

01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:19.875
He'll stay in the clinic for a few days,
then he'll return home.

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:25.375
But you,

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:27.708
it's a miracle you're alive.

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.208
I'll give you a prescription.

01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:42.041
You must be vigilant.
Pay attention to any changes.

01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:44.041
Marysia is in good hands.

01:34:44.125 --> 01:34:45.250
I meant Mr. Kosiba.

01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:48.416
Amnesia often lasts till death,

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:52.541
especially if it results from head trauma,
which was likely the case.

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:57.916
But sometimes the patients
begin to remember things.

01:34:59.375 --> 01:35:00.333
I see.

01:35:00.416 --> 01:35:03.208
If this happens, he will need a doctor.

01:35:05.208 --> 01:35:06.208
So,

01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:09.916
if Mr. Kosiba remembers anything,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.166
don't hesitate to let me know

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:15.250
at any time, even at night.

01:35:15.916 --> 01:35:16.916
But…

01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:23.541
Doctor, please, don't get me wrong,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.583
but I don't want him to remember anything.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:32.583
He's happy. That's what life is all about.

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:34.125
Why change that?

01:35:36.041 --> 01:35:39.666
I understand you. Perfectly well.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.583
Don't worry.

01:35:44.583 --> 01:35:46.125
You've heard him.

01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:50.000
Leszek's going to be all right.
He'll come here soon.

01:35:51.166 --> 01:35:53.875
-You two will dance again.
-He didn't take any money.

01:36:02.166 --> 01:36:03.958
-How did you do that?
-Hush.

01:36:14.666 --> 01:36:16.416
He's a good man, that's it.

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:30.750
I found you a clinic in Lausanne.

01:36:31.458 --> 01:36:32.458
What do you say?

01:36:35.916 --> 01:36:37.333
You'll be fine in no time.

01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:38.833
By the way,

01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:44.125
do you remember Miss Lena,
Princess Wielopolska?

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:47.500
She turned down Baron Sułkowski,

01:36:47.583 --> 01:36:49.291
so she's still available.

01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:51.375
I thought…

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.583
Are you listening to me?

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:57.125
I killed her.

01:36:57.666 --> 01:36:58.958
It was an accident.

01:36:59.041 --> 01:37:03.583
The police claim some wire was cut.

01:37:03.666 --> 01:37:05.708
I know nothing about motorcycles, but--

01:37:05.791 --> 01:37:07.166
-I killed her.
-Yes.

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:09.916
My dear!

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.666
He did kill her. That is the truth.

01:37:13.416 --> 01:37:15.541
This is how chasing waitresses ends.

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:17.708
Had you not allured her,
she'd still be alive.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.500
Let it be a lesson to you. Settle down.

01:37:21.666 --> 01:37:23.166
And you, do something already.

01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:27.666
Well, yes.

01:37:29.791 --> 01:37:32.458
There, there.

01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:38.375
Marysia.

01:37:41.625 --> 01:37:42.541
I'll do it.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.041
He hasn't come.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.166
Everything will be fine.

01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:04.333
Eat.

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:07.458
First, you need to get better.

01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:21.541
Do you have a nib and an inkwell?

01:38:34.916 --> 01:38:35.833
Good afternoon.

01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:39.416
The Count is in Switzerland.

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.458
Do you know his address?

01:38:43.958 --> 01:38:45.625
-I wrote to him, but--
-The Lady…

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.666
The Lady said not to disclose it.

01:38:54.458 --> 01:38:55.375
I see.

01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:06.833
-Thank you.
-Miss?

01:39:09.958 --> 01:39:11.375
Don't expect an answer.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:14.250
Don't wait.

01:41:28.208 --> 01:41:29.541
I'm sorry for what I said.

01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:34.500
-I didn't believe--
-I understand. You had every right not to.

01:41:36.291 --> 01:41:37.375
I believe in science.

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:41.000
I want to study medicine.

01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:43.291
That's wonderful.

01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:46.250
But it must be expensive.

01:41:50.916 --> 01:41:52.083
What about Leszek?

01:41:54.958 --> 01:41:56.875
I left a letter for him yesterday.

01:42:00.458 --> 01:42:01.916
I won't ask what you wrote.

01:42:02.708 --> 01:42:03.750
I wrote nothing.

01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:06.208
Nothing?

01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:08.416
Nothing.

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.166
He'll understand.

01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:19.791
WARSAW COURIER

01:43:56.208 --> 01:43:57.208
Józef!

01:44:03.625 --> 01:44:05.375
Call Lausanne.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.500
Can you repeat that?

01:44:13.208 --> 01:44:15.625
The same thing. What she wrote.

01:44:16.541 --> 01:44:18.583
"My dear Leszek. I am alive."

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:22.458
"I am alive
thanks to Antoni and our love."

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:25.708
"A letter from you
would help me a great deal."

01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:29.583
"I miss you.
The days grow long without you,

01:44:29.666 --> 01:44:30.666
incredibly so…"

01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:34.083
Oh, your mom is here.

01:44:35.166 --> 01:44:36.958
-Do you want to--
-No.

01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:47.791
You told him.

01:44:48.708 --> 01:44:51.000
You keep insisting I do something.

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:54.333
"Don't just sit there, Stanisław!
Do something!"

01:44:55.333 --> 01:44:56.625
-So--
-You told him.

01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:59.958
I mentioned it.

01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:28.333
My future wife.
Countess Czyńska, née Oksza.

01:45:28.916 --> 01:45:29.791
Lovely.

01:45:40.541 --> 01:45:44.125
Oy vey! Miss Marysia!

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.791
The piano is waiting.

01:45:49.875 --> 01:45:50.958
I had a buyer for it,

01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:54.375
but I said, "Gesheft is gesheft.
What if Miss Marysia comes back?"

01:45:55.541 --> 01:45:58.041
"How would I look her in the eye?"

01:45:59.000 --> 01:45:59.958
I will come back.

01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:03.875
I surely will,
but Antoni says I must still rest.

01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:12.666
Oh my! Miss… Ruta!

01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:15.958
I'm glad to see you, Miss Marysia.

01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:17.541
I was thinking…

01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:21.958
If I wrote that Czajkowski
is starving his kids,

01:46:22.041 --> 01:46:25.250
then I would get
that land we quarreled about.

01:46:25.333 --> 01:46:28.041
Mr. Wancerz, a petition is one thing.

01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:29.958
I won't write denunciations.

01:46:30.041 --> 01:46:33.625
Why not?
That letter you wrote was so nice.

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:41.250
Leszek is young.

01:46:42.458 --> 01:46:44.000
He's passionate.

01:46:44.708 --> 01:46:47.333
Counts have affairs with waitresses,

01:46:47.416 --> 01:46:49.708
but they marry names and fortunes.

01:46:50.458 --> 01:46:52.083
That is how our kind does it.

01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:59.083
Leszek mentioned
that you wanted to go to college.

01:47:16.875 --> 01:47:17.916
I thought so.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.916
The heart says one thing,
but reason disagrees.

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:24.083
In my experience, reason always wins.

01:47:27.291 --> 01:47:28.416
Leszek loves me.

01:47:29.833 --> 01:47:32.208
Otherwise, you wouldn't propose
such a sum.

01:47:32.875 --> 01:47:34.333
Leave and forget about him.

01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:37.958
It will be better for everyone,
especially Antoni.

01:47:40.666 --> 01:47:42.500
What does Antoni have to do with it?

01:47:43.041 --> 01:47:44.708
He stole surgical instruments,

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.208
performed an illegal surgery,
perhaps more than one.

01:47:48.958 --> 01:47:51.375
He could go to prison
for five years or more.

01:47:52.708 --> 01:47:54.666
I know nothing about any instruments.

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:56.500
He stole them to save you.

01:47:56.583 --> 01:47:58.250
Pawlicki gave you no chance.

01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:01.833
He really helps people.

01:48:01.916 --> 01:48:04.250
To heal, you need a diploma.

01:48:05.958 --> 01:48:07.375
Leave and forget Leszek.

01:48:07.958 --> 01:48:09.833
Then Antoni won't go to prison.

01:48:31.958 --> 01:48:34.083
Where are you going? Get in line!

01:48:41.958 --> 01:48:44.291
She said you could go to prison.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.166
So Marysia didn't take the money?

01:48:51.708 --> 01:48:53.208
Where is she now?

01:48:53.291 --> 01:48:54.125
I don't know.

01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:55.916
You two didn't talk?

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.208
I can't look her in the eye again.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:01.916
What happened?

01:49:04.416 --> 01:49:05.458
Haven't you heard?

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:09.291
Zenek confessed.

01:49:10.583 --> 01:49:11.916
He sabotaged the motorcycle.

01:49:13.625 --> 01:49:15.291
That scumbag almost killed her.

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:17.875
I was stupid.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.666
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:49:54.291 --> 01:49:55.458
Goodbye, darling.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.750
You stole the instruments.

01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:09.666
Didn't you?

01:50:18.625 --> 01:50:19.958
Why did you do that?

01:50:28.625 --> 01:50:29.958
I had no choice.

01:50:35.333 --> 01:50:37.250
Why did you do it for me?

01:50:37.333 --> 01:50:39.333
You can go to prison.

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.125
Hush.

01:50:49.416 --> 01:50:51.000
Don't worry, Antoni.

01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:02.583
It will be all right.

01:51:07.166 --> 01:51:08.458
It will be all right.

01:51:42.416 --> 01:51:43.333
Antoni?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.166
Have you seen Antoni?

01:51:57.250 --> 01:51:59.708
I woke up at 3:00 a.m.
He was already chopping wood.

01:51:59.791 --> 01:52:00.708
Why?

01:52:04.375 --> 01:52:05.666
For the winter, he said.

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:32.625
No one reported it.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.750
These belong to Dr. Pawlicki.
I stole them.

01:52:38.083 --> 01:52:40.833
-And then, I--
-I know what you did.

01:52:42.833 --> 01:52:45.083
You saved my wife's health.

01:52:48.916 --> 01:52:49.958
Arrest me, please.

01:52:51.083 --> 01:52:52.583
Nobody reported this.

01:52:52.666 --> 01:52:57.041
I'm reporting it.
I confess to stealing and to…

01:52:59.083 --> 01:53:01.291
helping people without a diploma.

01:53:06.875 --> 01:53:07.833
Are you sure?

01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:14.041
Yes, I am.

01:53:34.875 --> 01:53:35.791
Name.

01:53:42.166 --> 01:53:44.583
-Mr. Kosiba.
-That is not my name.

01:53:46.375 --> 01:53:50.583
I bought these documents from a thief.

01:53:56.625 --> 01:53:57.750
She's probably asleep.

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:00.708
She's still very weak.

01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:07.166
Marysia?

01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.666
Marysia?

01:54:25.041 --> 01:54:30.333
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
FORGIVE ME. MARYSIA

01:55:36.625 --> 01:55:37.541
Marysia!

01:55:39.291 --> 01:55:40.291
Marysia!

01:56:50.625 --> 01:56:53.875
To the forester's house?
Why would she go back there?

01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:57.416
Oksza is dead. Mrs. Beata too.

01:56:58.083 --> 01:56:59.375
So where is Marysia?

01:57:00.708 --> 01:57:01.625
I don't know.

01:57:02.666 --> 01:57:04.833
If I were her,
I'd go looking for my father.

01:57:05.583 --> 01:57:06.625
What do you mean?

01:57:07.666 --> 01:57:09.125
Oksza wasn't her father.

01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:12.125
-He wasn't?
-No.

01:57:12.958 --> 01:57:13.916
Then who was?

01:57:14.625 --> 01:57:15.500
I don't know.

01:57:16.666 --> 01:57:19.166
They never talked about it.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.333
"Ignorance is not an excuse.
It is a crime in itself."

01:57:28.333 --> 01:57:31.333
These are the words
of a renown medial authority,

01:57:31.416 --> 01:57:33.708
the late Professor Rafał Wilczur.

01:57:33.791 --> 01:57:36.541
He knew what he was talking about.
He was helping the poor.

01:57:36.625 --> 01:57:40.500
But he didn't put their lives at risk,
like Antoni Kosiba.

01:57:41.083 --> 01:57:45.333
Doing surgery
with a hammer and chisel is a crime.

01:57:45.833 --> 01:57:49.666
The defendant was so convinced
of his medical talents

01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:53.791
that he went as far
as to steal Dr. Pawlicki's instruments.

01:57:54.708 --> 01:57:56.833
That's why the prosecution demands

01:57:56.916 --> 01:57:59.958
a five-year prison sentence.

01:58:00.041 --> 01:58:03.500
Five years?
Zenek got three for attempted murder!

01:58:03.583 --> 01:58:06.416
-Please be quiet!
-Antoni, say something!

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.333
You shall be removed from the court!

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:13.000
Does the defendant plead guilty
to all charges?

01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:21.166
I do, Your Honor.

01:58:21.708 --> 01:58:22.791
Speak up, please.

01:58:26.083 --> 01:58:27.041
I do.

01:58:27.625 --> 01:58:30.208
Do you wish to explain yourself?

01:58:37.375 --> 01:58:40.750
The trial will begin tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

01:58:52.125 --> 01:58:54.000
How long will you be looking for her?

01:58:54.875 --> 01:58:55.875
Until I find her.

01:59:01.583 --> 01:59:02.791
Who was her father?

01:59:04.208 --> 01:59:08.125
He could afford furs and pianos.
He must have been rich.

01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:11.000
Why did his wife leave?
Maybe he gambled it away.

01:59:11.083 --> 01:59:12.833
She left because she loved another.

01:59:13.333 --> 01:59:16.583
Loving is one thing,
but why cause a scandal?

01:59:19.583 --> 01:59:20.500
Scandal?

01:59:22.291 --> 01:59:23.458
A scandal, of course.

01:59:24.583 --> 01:59:25.916
Is there a telephone here?

01:59:31.291 --> 01:59:32.250
Doctor?

01:59:34.916 --> 01:59:36.291
What news from the world?

01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:41.041
Look, Staś. He was here, remember?

01:59:47.041 --> 01:59:51.375
QUACKERY IN RADOLISZKI

02:00:02.166 --> 02:00:04.208
Stanisław, hand me my glasses.

02:00:04.291 --> 02:00:05.125
I won't.

02:00:06.375 --> 02:00:08.875
I refuse to do your bidding any longer.

02:00:08.958 --> 02:00:10.333
I don't like this tone.

02:00:13.708 --> 02:00:17.625
You are a pompous, self-righteous hag.

02:00:21.291 --> 02:00:23.166
I hope he won't be found guilty.

02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:25.458
I didn't report him. I told you.

02:00:25.541 --> 02:00:26.958
The Young Master is calling.

02:00:38.250 --> 02:00:39.250
Hello?

02:00:41.250 --> 02:00:43.958
Due to our past relationship,

02:00:44.833 --> 02:00:47.375
I took the liberty to disturb you, madam.

02:00:48.583 --> 02:00:49.708
I am listening.

02:00:50.333 --> 02:00:54.166
Have you ever heard the name Jan Oksza?

02:00:54.833 --> 02:00:56.958
I am not interested in scandals.

02:00:58.625 --> 02:01:00.416
I am asking for your help.

02:01:33.458 --> 02:01:35.958
Excuse me. I'm looking for somebody.

02:01:38.833 --> 02:01:40.083
Do you know her?

02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:42.833
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

02:02:12.208 --> 02:02:15.333
Morning. Some patsy's asking about you.

02:03:30.958 --> 02:03:32.166
How did you find me?

02:03:33.833 --> 02:03:35.666
Thanks to my mother, of all people.

02:03:38.833 --> 02:03:42.125
She remembered the scandal.
That's how I found this address.

02:03:44.958 --> 02:03:46.375
How is Antoni?

02:03:47.291 --> 02:03:49.041
-Have you seen him?
-You don't know?

02:03:50.791 --> 02:03:51.750
He's on trial.

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:19.625
All rise!

02:04:28.375 --> 02:04:30.000
-Where is the court?
-In Radom.

02:04:33.791 --> 02:04:34.791
Do you have a car?

02:04:50.625 --> 02:04:54.125
He told me to lie down and grabbed my arm.

02:04:54.833 --> 02:04:57.083
He put his foot here and pulled.

02:04:57.166 --> 02:05:00.625
Mother had an abscess on her leg.

02:05:00.708 --> 02:05:03.458
Couldn't walk for a year.
Let her show you.

02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:05.916
Mother, let the judge see.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.666
If people were sick, they went to Antoni.

02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:10.791
He always helped.

02:05:10.875 --> 02:05:12.375
He never took any money.

02:05:12.458 --> 02:05:14.791
I bet Zośka wasn't too happy about it.

02:05:14.875 --> 02:05:16.583
They're not married and live in sin!

02:05:16.666 --> 02:05:18.291
-Lies!
-Everyone saw.

02:05:18.375 --> 02:05:21.208
-That's the truth!
-Be quiet, woman!

02:05:21.291 --> 02:05:23.791
We've all seen how she tempted him!

02:05:34.083 --> 02:05:36.916
Why didn't you tell me
that Jan Oksza wasn't your father?

02:05:37.708 --> 02:05:38.625
He was!

02:05:39.125 --> 02:05:43.041
I mean, my biological father
was Rafał Wilczur.

02:05:43.583 --> 02:05:45.208
But I don't remember him.

02:05:46.708 --> 02:05:48.041
He killed himself.

02:05:48.125 --> 02:05:50.375
They found a coat, not the body.

02:05:50.458 --> 02:05:51.750
How do you know?

02:05:51.833 --> 02:05:54.208
All the papers wrote about it.

02:05:54.291 --> 02:05:55.500
My mother told me.

02:05:58.083 --> 02:06:01.583
He was a genius.
A pioneer of brain surgery.

02:06:07.208 --> 02:06:09.458
Can you go faster? Come on!

02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:26.125
Thank you. That is enough.

02:06:35.916 --> 02:06:39.916
I'm impressed.
But what do you want to prove?

02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:45.041
I want to prove
that the defendant could be a doctor,

02:06:45.125 --> 02:06:48.458
but he suffers from amnesia
and does not recall his past.

02:06:48.541 --> 02:06:51.125
I need proof, not a show.

02:06:51.208 --> 02:06:54.875
Of course. May I call another witness?

02:06:54.958 --> 02:06:58.083
Enough. We know what the defendant can do.

02:06:58.166 --> 02:06:59.791
But the law is the law.

02:07:00.875 --> 02:07:04.208
Only legitimate doctors
are allowed to treat people.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.166
Dura lex, sed lex.

02:07:06.250 --> 02:07:08.625
With your permission, Your Honor,

02:07:08.708 --> 02:07:13.250
I'd like to call to the stand
Professor Jerzy Dobraniecki,

02:07:13.333 --> 02:07:17.166
a renown specialist,
head of the Polish Surgical Association.

02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:19.250
We know who Professor Dobraniecki is.

02:07:19.958 --> 02:07:24.250
Professor, as a specialist,
would you like to comment on the case?

02:07:55.208 --> 02:07:56.833
We are trying Antoni Kosiba,

02:07:58.166 --> 02:08:01.708
but we know for a fact
that this man is not Antoni Kosiba.

02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:05.833
He may be a doctor. It is quite possible.

02:08:06.541 --> 02:08:09.416
But he lost his memory due to head trauma.

02:08:10.958 --> 02:08:15.083
The cutting-edge methods
we use in our clinic,

02:08:15.166 --> 02:08:17.416
the innovative drugs,

02:08:17.916 --> 02:08:20.458
the most advanced
electroconvulsive therapy,

02:08:20.541 --> 02:08:25.083
or perhaps
even a surgical procedure could help…

02:08:25.166 --> 02:08:29.875
I understand what you are getting at.
Thank you, Professor.

02:08:29.958 --> 02:08:34.708
DISTRICT COURT

02:08:51.333 --> 02:08:54.958
Do you think Wilczur knew
how to do a craniotomy?

02:08:55.791 --> 02:08:56.958
That's what they wrote.

02:08:59.875 --> 02:09:00.833
I love you.

02:09:07.125 --> 02:09:08.458
You've heard the question.

02:09:09.958 --> 02:09:13.875
The Professor offers you treatment.
What do you say?

02:09:17.291 --> 02:09:19.666
-Silence!
-Marysia?

02:09:21.291 --> 02:09:22.583
Silence!

02:09:25.291 --> 02:09:26.500
Who are you?

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.333
My name is Maria Jolanta Wilczur.

02:09:47.708 --> 02:09:48.875
And this is my father.

02:09:53.708 --> 02:09:54.958
Silence, please!

02:09:57.375 --> 02:09:58.625
Silence!

02:10:13.125 --> 02:10:16.291
I remember the defendant too.
He saved my life.

02:10:17.041 --> 02:10:19.916
You cannot remember him.
You were a little kid!

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.000
I was ten, Mr. Dobraniecki.
So what? I will never forget it.

02:10:24.083 --> 02:10:25.791
Professor Wilczur is dead!

02:10:29.708 --> 02:10:30.708
He is alive.

02:11:45.708 --> 02:11:46.625
Mazel tov!

02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:51.041
Mazel tov! Lehayim! Mazel tov!

02:11:55.916 --> 02:11:59.500
Kiss the bride!

02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:15.333
Please, sit down, Mrs. Wilczur.

02:12:17.916 --> 02:12:20.291
Leszek will be very happy.

02:12:20.375 --> 02:12:22.375
I hope you are right, Baron.

02:12:22.458 --> 02:12:23.791
Stay still!

02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:12.500
IN MEMORY OF MY FATHER, RYSZARD
