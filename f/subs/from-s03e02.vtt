people you can look up.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.588
Boyd Stevens.
His family went missing.

15:21.671 --> 15:25.550
Uh... Donna. Um, Donna...

15:26.635 --> 15:28.970
Um, okay.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.056
Liu! Liu!
Tian-Chen and Kenny Liu.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.683
That family--
that family's there, too.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.062
You're lying. I-I...

15:37.145 --> 15:38.521
I don't know how you're
doing this, but you're lying.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.606
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.399
I swear to you
I'm not.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.360
I swear
on my children's lives.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.528
My family is trapped,
and Victor is trapped, too.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.947
Then how did you
get here, huh?

15:49.616 --> 15:53.536
You want me to believe you just
happen to be the one person

15:53.620 --> 15:56.748
who somehow managed to escape
this terrifying place?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.958
Listen, I don't understand,
but yes, yes.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.543
And Victor helped me.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.253
No, don't... [scoffs]

16:02.337 --> 16:05.048
[sighs] Please.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.467
Victor is a good man.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.470
He's nice and sweet,
and my son loves him.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.266
And my daughter...
He saved my daughter's life.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.563
I thought that

16:20.647 --> 16:24.192
if I saved the children
locked in the tower, then...

16:24.275 --> 16:26.653
somehow, I could save her from
whatever's happening to her--

16:26.736 --> 16:29.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What did you say?

16:29.823 --> 16:33.618
Well, when I was in town,
I started seeing children,

16:33.702 --> 16:36.037
or at least imagining
I was.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.207
And they were
really frightening.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.501
Victor said that they were
children locked in the tower,

16:41.584 --> 16:44.587
that if I saved them,
then maybe I could--

16:44.671 --> 16:47.298
I could somehow help my daughter
from what she's going through,

16:47.382 --> 16:48.633
and I don't know
if I'm doing it--

16:48.717 --> 16:50.635
-[knock on door]
-[officer] Camden PD!

16:50.719 --> 16:52.721
Please.
Don't let them in. Please.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.515
-Uh...
-Please!

16:55.598 --> 16:57.559
I'm not lying.
I'm not lying.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.102
[breathing unsteadily]

17:06.568 --> 17:09.237
[officer] Henry!
Henry, you in there?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.821
-[opens door]
-Hey, man.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.325
I screwed up, man.
I thought I had an intruder

17:14.409 --> 17:17.369
and turned out to be
just a dog off the leash.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.372
The owner came back to...

17:19.455 --> 17:23.041
Look, I owe you a dozen,
okay? I'm sorry.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.588
[officer] All right, Henry.
Take care of yourself.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.506
[Henry] Yeah, you, too.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:28.590 --> 17:32.051
-Thanks.
-[door closes]

17:37.557 --> 17:41.686
I, uh, bought that
almost 40 years ago...

17:41.770 --> 17:46.691
a few years after
my family disappeared.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.695
I never once had the courage
to even load it, much less...

17:52.405 --> 17:53.823
I'm gonna make you
something to eat.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.831
It was an ambush.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.209
They knew we'd
go after the animals.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.127
Goddamn things
opened the pen

18:06.211 --> 18:09.631
and just waited for us
to walk right to them.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.091
How many did you save?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.428
What's... What?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.596
Animals.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.851
How many did you save?
Was it worth it?

18:21.935 --> 18:24.145
Risking everyone's lives,
for what?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.231
An extra goat? A cow?

18:26.314 --> 18:29.734
How much better off are we
today than we were yesterday?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.277
Wait, wait.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.238
Are you saying
that I had a choice?

18:33.321 --> 18:35.198
-[scoffs]
-Those animals are all we have!

18:35.281 --> 18:39.744
No, Boyd!
We are all we have!

18:39.828 --> 18:42.622
Us! These people!
This family!

18:42.705 --> 18:45.792
That is all we've got,
and now we've got one less!

18:45.875 --> 18:47.585
So, what was--
what was I supposed to do?!

18:47.669 --> 18:49.337
Just stand there,

18:49.420 --> 18:52.173
watching our only resource go
wandering off into the woods?

18:52.257 --> 18:53.216
We would have starved!

18:53.299 --> 18:54.592
We would have found
another way!

18:54.676 --> 18:57.512
Yesterday you were ready
to crawl into a fucking hole

18:57.595 --> 18:59.556
because the crops
had spoiled!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.349
And now you're standing there,
telling me

19:01.432 --> 19:02.851
that we would have found
another way?!

19:02.934 --> 19:06.271
That I shoulda just--
I shoulda--

19:06.354 --> 19:07.772
That I should just--
get the fuck outta here!

19:07.856 --> 19:09.274
-What the fuck am I--
-No, okay, No, you're right.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.486
You're right.
You did what you had to do.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.491
You did the only thing
you could do.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.245
And you lost...

19:22.328 --> 19:28.501
...because the game here
is fucking rigged.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.340
And no matter what
hand you play, you lose.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.592
Donna. Donna...

19:35.675 --> 19:37.468
No, no, no.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.470
I'm not angry at you, Boyd.

19:39.554 --> 19:42.265
I'm not. [sighs]

19:42.348 --> 19:43.850
I'm angry at me.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.477
Angry at me

19:46.561 --> 19:49.981
because you told us that,
someday, we'd go home...

19:50.064 --> 19:54.777
[sighs] ...and I was stupid
enough to believe it.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.447
-I'm--
-Get off!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.574
[sobbing]

19:59.657 --> 20:01.492
[inhaling sharply] Oh!

20:01.576 --> 20:04.412
We gotta dress that cow
before the meat spoils.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.540
[door opens]

20:07.624 --> 20:08.833
-[knock on door]
-[retching]

20:08.917 --> 20:10.335
[Ellis] Hey.
You been in there for a while.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.753
You okay?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.630
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-You know, I was thinking,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.549
maybe we should go see Kristi,
uh, just as a precaution.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.886
Ugh. [gasping]

20:21.471 --> 20:23.348
Look, that's not necessary.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.974
-It's just morning sickness.
-[toilet flushes]

20:25.058 --> 20:27.226
Can you at least
open the door?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.603
Give me a second!

20:28.686 --> 20:31.230
You know, why don't
I go see if Kristi

20:31.314 --> 20:34.442
can just come up here,
and that way, you can just stay?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.402
-Look, I said I'm fine!
-[water running]

20:36.486 --> 20:38.529
I don't need everybody--

20:38.613 --> 20:40.782
It doesn't feel right.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.538
You're not sleeping.
You're barely eating.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.751
Fatima?

20:57.674 --> 21:00.426
Fatima? Hey, look, come on.
What's going on?

21:00.510 --> 21:01.552
[crunching]

21:11.646 --> 21:13.272
Fatima, you're scaring me.
Come on.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.900
Can you please open the door?

21:15.984 --> 21:18.319
[door creaks]

21:18.403 --> 21:24.367
Uh, I think you're right.
Maybe we should go see Kristi.

21:27.870 --> 21:31.040
Kristi? You here?

21:32.166 --> 21:34.419
Wait here.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.420
Hello?

21:35.503 --> 21:36.671
[Marielle] Coming.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.758
-Hey.
-Is Kristi here?

21:40.842 --> 21:43.761
Uh, she's...
She's down in town.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.930
She's taking the news
about Tian-Chen pretty hard.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.932
Listen, this can totally wait.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.809
-The poor woman...
-No, it really can't.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.644
Come on in.
I'll take a look at you.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.899
You know what?
Maybe we should wait for Kristi.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.444
Kristi's dealing
with a lot right now.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.363
Yeah, but...

22:03.698 --> 22:05.408
Look, no offense.
You're not a doctor.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.784
I am, however,
a pediatric nurse.

22:06.868 --> 22:09.037
So, as far as
pregnancy goes,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.123
I've pretty much seen
everything.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.000
Come on. Come.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.674
Kinda cold out for a swim.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.971
What are you doing
out here?

22:27.055 --> 22:29.682
I just realized that...

22:29.766 --> 22:32.101
I can't even remember
whose truck this was.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.438
That's how many
people we...

22:37.690 --> 22:40.109
Danny.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.904
And his, um--
his girlfriend Shay.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.072
Right.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.948
Danny and Shay.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.869
They were good kids, yeah.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.085
What happened
last night, it...

22:57.168 --> 22:58.711
wasn't your fault.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.422
You know,
with all due respect, Kristi,

23:01.506 --> 23:04.509
I'm... not here
for a pep talk.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.385
All due respect, Boyd,
I don't really give a shit.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.137
[sighs]

23:08.221 --> 23:09.889
Look, after what happened
with Sara,

23:09.972 --> 23:12.600
when she tried
to hurt Ethan...

23:12.683 --> 23:14.685
you sat with me
in that diner

23:14.769 --> 23:16.395
and you told me
it wasn't my fault,

23:16.479 --> 23:18.564
that it was this place,

23:18.648 --> 23:21.192
that I had saved a lot of lives,
and that I was gonna save

23:21.275 --> 23:24.821
a hell of a lot more by the time
this all was finished.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.531
So, was that just
a bunch of bullshit

23:26.614 --> 23:29.408
to make me feel better,
or did you mean it?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.204
[stammers]

23:33.287 --> 23:38.000
Hey. This isn't your fault.
Okay?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.798
Now, come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.

23:43.881 --> 23:44.924
[Kenny] Guys!

23:45.007 --> 23:47.802
Hey! We found food!

23:47.885 --> 23:50.054
Look! Look at this!

23:50.138 --> 23:52.640
There's a--there's a lake,
and it's got everything.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.225
It's got vegetables...

23:54.308 --> 23:55.935
[Jim] We found food!

23:57.019 --> 23:58.563
All right.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.693
There's, uh,
there's potatoes.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.445
There might even be
fish in the water!

24:08.656 --> 24:10.741
What's going on?

24:10.825 --> 24:12.994
[indistinct murmurs]

24:17.123 --> 24:19.083
Where are my kids?

24:19.167 --> 24:20.751
They're fine.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.170
They're--
they're okay.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.881
Whose blood is that?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.549
Kenny...

24:29.218 --> 24:30.636
Where's...

24:32.597 --> 24:34.599
Wait. Where's...

24:34.682 --> 24:36.058
Where's my mom?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.768
Kenny, maybe we
should go inside.

24:38.853 --> 24:39.979
Kenny!

24:40.062 --> 24:41.480
Mom?

24:48.029 --> 24:49.655
Ma!

24:51.699 --> 24:54.619
Mom! [shouting in Cantonese]

24:54.702 --> 24:57.163
-Hey, Kenny--
-Stop! No, no, no, no, no.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.875
[shouting in Cantonese]

25:00.958 --> 25:02.793
-Hey, bud. Ken?
-No, stop!

25:02.877 --> 25:03.878
-Bud, I'm...
-No.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.880
-...so s--
-Stop, stop. No! No, no!

25:05.963 --> 25:08.591
-Listen, I'm so--
-No, no! Stop! Just--just stop.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.800
Okay.

25:09.884 --> 25:13.054
[Kenny] Okay?
[breathing rapidly]

25:19.894 --> 25:21.687
Okay. Yeah.

25:21.771 --> 25:25.107
[breathing deeply]

25:25.191 --> 25:26.776
I got it.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.736
[murmuring continues]

25:40.414 --> 25:42.041
[door creaks]

25:43.668 --> 25:45.253
I'm so sorry. I'm so--

25:46.420 --> 25:48.047
I'm so sorry.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.218
-[door closes]
-[sobbing]

25:52.301 --> 25:54.303
Kenny, hey.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.348
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. I'm okay.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.183
I'm okay. I'm okay.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.060
[inhaling, exhaling sharply]

26:07.858 --> 26:09.110
I'm okay.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.154
I'm okay.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.032
[exhaling sharply] I'm okay.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.162
Where is she?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.873
In the church.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.001
[breathing shakily]

26:31.882 --> 26:35.052
I just, uh...

26:35.136 --> 26:39.181
I just... I need to
sit here for a minute.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.766
'Kay?

26:40.850 --> 26:42.351
Yeah. Okay.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.944
When was the last time
you ate?

26:52.028 --> 26:55.156
Uh, three... four days?

26:55.239 --> 26:56.741
She can't keep
anything down.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.743
I've tried to.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.078
It's just even
the smell of food,

27:01.162 --> 27:03.331
it's just...

27:03.414 --> 27:05.207
-[exhales deeply]
-Deep breath.

27:08.002 --> 27:10.004
Look, are you sure we
shouldn't just get Kristi?

27:10.087 --> 27:12.006
-Ellis, just...
-How've you been doing

27:12.089 --> 27:13.341
since, you know...

27:13.424 --> 27:15.885
Since what?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.845
Since I went
through withdrawal,

27:17.928 --> 27:21.849
or since this place...
